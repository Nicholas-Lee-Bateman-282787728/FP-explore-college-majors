917357,A32JKNQ6BABMQ2,B000A0D1Q0,"abe ""starman""","[4, 4]","finaly,a wrestling dvd with all the right matches.i a bunch of wrestling dvds devoted to certain wrestlers dont cover thier greatest moments or matches..this is one of the few with all of the high profile,greatest and career defining bouts on it.i understand there is an  entire 90 minute plus dvd with just wrestlers talking crap on the ultimate warrior.what an ungrateful bunch of d#$%^!s.the ultimate warrior was one of the greatest wrestlers of all time.and thats how they repay his awesomeness and many great contributions to the wrestling world?by putting out a degradating video set of him?what a joke!if you do buy this dvd set,just skip the talking dvd.i would.and who goes out and buys a dvd set like this anyway?an ultimate warrior fan who would hear everyone talking trash on his hero?a wrestling historian who just likes the old stories?someone who hates the warrior and wants to talk bad?then theres old triple h!on every dvd set,he talks bad on whoever its made for.he made fun of the big shows weight problem and his diabetes.he said hardcore wasnt a style although he was defined by hardcore matches.he said rey mysterio jr wasnt any good even though rey beat him twice already in high profile matches.he even trashed vince mc mahon.if it wasnt for vince,triple h wouldnt even have a job,a wife ,a child or something like 13 world title reigns.triple h is an ungrateful p@#$$%!and you know what triple h said?he said his loss to the ultimate warrior at wrestlemania was one of the most embarrassing moments in wwe history.the audacity!the ultimate warrior slapped triple h around and called him suzie!he kicked that pompous,losers butt in 1:38.i would be embarrassed  too.the wrestlers frequently say they cant understand the ultimate warrior's interviews. maybe they've taken too many chairs to the  head. they weren't that different than hulk Hogan's interviews. maybe they should read a book and then they'll have the brain power to keep up.so,one dvd will be garbage and one will be a classic.plus,i looked up the ultimate warrior online.in the video,vince says he lokked for any reason at all to fire the ultimate warrior,because he was unprofessional.all of the things i found usualy stemmed from vince stiffing him on money he owed.and the one good excuse i did find was the ultimate warrior using drugs.vince tries to sound like he cares.every biography ive ever watched on wrestling says marijauna,steroids and pain killers were everywhere in wrestling.and many times supplied by vince himself.it just gets my blood boiling to see one of the greatest wrestlers of all time get talked down on by hypocrites.the ultimate warrior is my 5th favorite wrestler of all time,from thor to sheamus!",5,seems fair,1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,2714,"['finaly', 'wrestling', 'dvd', 'right', 'matches.i', 'bunch', 'wrestling', 'dvds', 'devoted', 'certain', 'wrestlers', 'dont', 'cover',

917358,A3DZ2907IDX7ME,B000A0D1Q0,A Forest Fan,"[7, 15]","Wrestling fans from the early 1990s will remember the phenomenon of the Ultimate Warrior, a wrestler who would come out with a driving guitar theme, painted face, and rope-shaking maniacism. The years have not been kind to the Warrior, he legally changed his name to ""The Warrior"", and is not beloved by his fellow wrestlers.Now the WWE has released an Ultimate Warrior DVD, ""The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior"". This single-disc collection is a waste of money, don't buy, and heck, don't rent it if available.The ""documentary"" consists of terrible edited segments showing the Warrior acting crazy or disoriented, with various managers and behind-the-scenes people (including Vince McMahon) making disparaging comments about the guy. Sure, the Warrior missed a lot of dates (a no-no for any professional wrestler), and pissed off a lot of people, but this DVD is an insult to fans who want to know more about him.When Jesse Ventura became governor of Minnesota, Vince McMahon released a similar videotape trashing him, with people like Freddie Blassie being interviewed about what a bum he was. So it was then, so it is now.A nice extra would have been the inclusion of the Ultimate Warrior's original videotape released in 1990, showing him introducing a number of his greatest fueds with Hercules Hernandez, Rick Rude, and a non-televised (non-title) match with the Macho Man Randy Savage. Instead, you don't get much for your money for this collection, I was very disappointed.Steer clear!",1,Self-Destruction of WWE's releases,1135209600,"12 22, 2005",2005,1502,"['Wrestling', 'fans', 'early', '1990s', 'will', 'remember', 'phenomenon', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'wrestler', 'who', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'driving', 'guitar', 'theme', 'painted', 'face', 'rope-shaking', 'maniacism', 'years', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'kind', 'Warrior', 'legally', 'changed', 'name', 'Warrior', 'not', 'beloved', 'fellow', 'wrestlers.Now', 'WWE', 'released', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'DVD', 'Self-Destruction', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'single-disc', 'collection', 'waste', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'heck', 'do', ""n't"", 'rent', 'available.The', 'documentary', 'consists', 'terrible', 'edited', 'segments', 'showing', 'Warrior', 'acting', 'crazy', 'disoriented', 'various', 'managers', 'behind-the-scenes', 'people', 'including', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'making', 'disparaging', 'comments', 'guy', 'Sure', 'Warrior', 'missed', 'lot', 'dates', 'no-no', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'pissed', 'off', 'lot', 'people', 'DVD', 'insult', 'fans', 'who', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'him.When', 'Jesse', 'Ventura', 'became', 'governor', 'Minnesota', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'released', 'similar', 'videotape', 'trashing', 'people', 'Freddie', 'Blassie', 'being', 'interviewed', 'what', 'bum', 'was', 'was', 'then', 'now.A', 'nice', 'extra', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'inclusion', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'original', 'videotape', 'released', '1990', 'showing', 'introducing', 'number', 'greatest', 'fueds', 'Hercules', 'Hernandez', 'Rick', 'Rude', 'non-televised', 'non-title', 'match', 'Macho', 'Man', 'Randy', 'Savage', 'Instead', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'money', 'collection', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed.Steer', 'clear']",The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior
917359,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B000A0D1Q0,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[0, 2]","I probably should have realized that the WARRIAH~! parted on poor terms with the WWF in 1996, but I hadn't realized just how poor they were.This documentary is rather entertaining, with lots of footage of the ULTIMATE WARRIAH~! but for the most part... it's not a ""documentary""; it's commentary.While people like Edge, Jericho, and Christian seem to respect the WARRIAH~!, everyone else just absolutely s***s on the man every moment they can after the opening pleasantries about how big an impact he made on the business!Every other scene features Hulk Hogan or Ted DiBiase or Bobby Heenan or Sergeant Slaughter or Steve Lombardi or Bruce Prichard or Gene Oakerlund s***ing on the WARRIAH~!  Every chance they can, they keep saying how awful a wrestler WARRIAH~! was, which in the case of some people (Hulk Hogan much?) is the equivalent of the Pot approaching the Kettle and saying ""You are black"".Obviously WARRIAH~! was nowhere near a decent wrestler at the time, but the fact that his peers constantly remark just how awful he is is insulting and a blatant ""hitjob"" to tarnish his skills.  The fact is, while his skills weren't likely very good, they were about on par with much of the WWF's in-ring quality of the time.  Is the WARRIAH~! a bad wrestler?  Yes.  Is he substantially worse than Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, Rick Rude, Sergeant Slaughter?  Absolutely not.  The WWF's in-ring style in the mid-late 80s and early 90s was what is called by some ""hoss"" style, meaning a heavy emphasis on ""big"" guys (muscly or tall) and little to no emphasis on actual athletic talent.  This was in the era where Vince's Big and Tall fetish was running rampant.Even after showing the part regarding WARRIAH~!'s Wrestlemania victory over Hogan, they CONTINUE to s*** all over WARRIAH~!'s skill, and go on to start PRAISING HOGAN as if he were the superstar for so graciously ""passing the torch"" to Hogan, while Jericho, Edge, and Christian have the decency to say that WARRIAH~! could put on great matches with great opponents.Before this DVD, I had figured the ULTIMATE WARRIAH~! had had some sort of colossal mental breakdown or devolving into serious drug use or something to warrant such a title as ""The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior"".  Instead, it starts ALL OF A SUDDEN in early 1991, after continuous WARRIAH~! bashing and a quick overview of his feuds with Rick Rude and Randy Savage.ALL OF A SUDDEN at the Royal Rumble, it's said that WARRIAH~! basically held up Vince for more money, saying he wouldn't go out and perform unless he got paid a certain amount.  I agree that this is a really piss-poor unprofessional thing to do, but the talking-head commentary takes this event and runs with it for the next ten minutes, bashing and bashing how awful and evil a man WARRIAH~! is and how arrogant he is and how bad a wrestler he is (take a shot) and how ungrateful he is.Then comes his lawsuit in 1993, changing his name to Warrior, and returning to the WWF in 1996, only to be fired again for no-showing and demanding more money.  Again, this is a bad thing, but hardly anything like ""self destruction"".Perhaps his brief time in WCW could explain the whole ""self destruction"" part, and it does... for five minutes.  And only covering one promo.  ONE!  WARRIAH~!'s first coming to WCW, where he had a 15 minute rambling promo on Hulk Hogan that, due to WCW's own incompetence and lack of leadershipm was completely unscripted, nonsensical, redundant, and absolutely mad and out of control.And that's it.  Then they go on to show his match against Hogan from Halloween Havoc 98, arguably one of the worst in history.Then it ends with some brief mention of his speaking tours, which unfortunately they can't show any footage of (I would've given this DVD five stars if they just had the footage or at least mention of that damn chestnut of WARRIAH~! wisdom ""Queering doesn't make the world work""*), and that's it.So what we have is a fun collection of videos of WARRIAH~!, accompanied by a total hitjob of bashing and heavily biased commentary, boiling down to Christian, Edge, and Jericho respecting WARRIAH~! for his contributions to the business, and the rest hating WARRIAH~! and hoping he burns in hell (exaggeration, but close enough).Also, bonus matches~!  But why would you want to watch a WARRIAH~! match?*I completely disagree with this statement and believe it is wrong and in poor taste.  However, I happen to find it a hilarious statement due to the sheer ridiculousness and tastelessness of it.",3,Not enough self-destruction.

Why did Vince McMahon push the Warrior all the way to the top and ride his success for so long?  Obviously, he was a better performer than McMahon would lead you to believe.McMahon and Hogan shoot away in interviews on this DVD, which are indeed interesting.  It used to be taboo for a wrestler to step totally out of character and talk publicly about the behind the scenes planning of wrestling storylines and matches, so I was pleasantly surprised by the candor of the interviews. Warrior gets ridiculed in this DVD for adopting the name Warrior as his own personal, legal name, and he often gets referred to, disrespectfully it would seem, as ""Jim.""The matches included aren't very good (Warrior didn't ever do much in the ring), but the match with Savage back in his prime was probably the most entertaining.  The match with Honky Tonk Man has got to be one of the worst title-changing matches of all time.The title of this DVD - The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior - is misleading, since the Warrior never really did that.

Shoot I thought the same thing about Sting who trained with the Warrior but the only difference was that Sting did a lot better with his success and his career then the Warrior did.  Sting became an icon and a legend in his own right becoming known as the Franchise a title which he still keeps to this day even after the WWE bought WCW Sting chose not to come over like Flair did.  It is a shame though that a lot of wrestlers didn't have much respect for the Warrior although he did do a lot for the business in the 80s when Hogan was out with injuries.  I just wished his career would have ended on a better note then it did.  This dvd should be interesting although I haven't watched it yet and I am hoping it has a one of the best matches in the Warrior's career the match with Hogan at Wrestlemania which showcased both wrestler's styles so well and also a passing of the torch by Hogan to the Warrior.

For the majority of the people interviewed on this DVD stated they didn't like Warrior, apparently Warrior has/had serious issues.

917368,A2DK2OY6R3WICK,B000A0D1Q0,C.W. Fitch,"[3, 4]","""The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior"" may seem like a complete bash of the Warrior (real name: Jim Hellwig) at first glance, but once the video gets going, instead provides an honest take on the Warrior, his character, charisma, and his in-ring ability (which, while instantly exciting, was, shall we say, mediocre at best).  Fans of the Warrior may even be pleasantly surprised by what those interviewed had to say about him.Be warned at first that this is not a biography of Warrior (which is Hellwig's current legal name) as such; it starts out just like the Undertaker's latest DVD epic, with his debut and first matches in the southern wrestling circuits.  There is no background offered on Warrior; there's nothing about how he broke into the business or his occupations previous to wrestling, which seems to be the standard WWE is offering nowadays.  It makes sense, actually; superstars like the Undertaker and the Ultimate Warrior's most popular traits were that they were shrouded in mystery.  That theme is held intact in this DVD.  The scope of time covered here goes through the Warrior's complete career, from his first incarnation as Blade Runner Rock to his final appearance in (and disappearance from) WCW.  WWE will claim to this day that the Warrior was a great concept at first, but as legends like Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan, Gene Okerlund, Hulk Hogan, and other wrestlers who regularly worked with him tell the tale, it was actually the man, not the character, who self-destructed and caused so many problems for WWE and WCW.  Current WWE superstars such as Chris Jericho, Edge, and Christian also add their reflections on watching the Warrior on the tube in their younger days and what effects he had on them.  They also poke a little fun at the Warrior's cryptic interviews and the downright ridiculous storylines in which he was involved.  From the Wrestlemania X8 DVD, though, we know that seeing Warrior vs. Hogan at Wrestlemania VI as a kid was what made Edge finally decide that he was going to be a wrestler, so at least Warrior made a difference in someone's life.  By the end of the documentary, the truth (according to WWE) is revealed as to how the Warrior was so successful.For the most part, I was pleased with how the story of the Warrior and his ""downfall"" was presented, and thought that those interviewed were both honest and sincere about their opinions.  Parts of the doc brought back memories of the Warrior's most...well, memorable...moments, and brought a few laughs as well.  I found myself wondering why I was so into the Warrior as a kid, but I know I wasn't alone.  The documentary is just over 1  hours long, and is just informative enough without getting boring at all.  Extra features on the disc include additional short interviews with Jerry ""The King"" Lawler and Ted DiBiase, Christian hilariously reenacting of one of Warrior's most disturbing promos, and 5 full matches (two of which are less than a minute long-what a surprise), including Hogan/ Warrior from Wrestlemania VI and the Retirement Match vs. ""Macho King"" Randy Savage, both classics.Warrior fans will probably dig this DVD, and if you're an old-school wrestling fan like me who pines after the days when colorful characters were more important than shock TV, you'll relive some good stuff here.",4,"Fair, funny, and full of Destrucity.",1129766400,"10 20, 2005",2005,3321,"['Self-Destruction', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'may', 'seem', 'complete', 'bash', 'Warrior', 'real', 'name', 'Jim', 'Hellwig', 'first', 'glance', 'once', 'video', 'going', 'instead', 'honest', 'take', 'Warrior', 'character', 'charisma', 'in-ring', 'ability', 'instantly', 'exciting', 'was', 'shall', 'say', 'mediocre', 'best', 'Fans', 'Warrior', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'what', 'interviewed', 'had', 'say', 'him.Be', 'warned', 'first', 'not', 'biography', 'Warrior', 'Hellwig', 'current', 'legal', 'name', 'such', 'out', 'just', 'Undertaker', 'latest', 'DVD', 'epic', 'debut', 'first', 'matches', 'southern', 'wrestling', 'circuits', 'background', 'offered', 'Warrior', 'nothing', 'how', 'broke', 'business', 'occupations', 'previous', 'wrestling', 'be', 'standard', 'WWE', 'offering', 'nowadays', 'sense', 'actually', 'superstars', 'Undertaker', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'most', 'popular', 'traits', 'were', 'were', 'shrouded', 'mystery', 'theme', 'held', 'intact', 'DVD', 'scope', 'time', 'covered', 'here', 'Warrior', 'complete', 'career', 'first', 'incarnation', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Rock', 'final', 'appearance', 'disappearance', 'WCW', 'WWE', 'will', 'claim', 'day', 'Warrior', 'was', 'great', 'concept', 'first', 'legends', 'Bobby', 'Brain', 'Heenan', 'Gene', 'Okerlund', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'other', 'wrestlers', 'who', 'regularly', 'worked', 'tell', 'tale', 'was', 'actually', 'man', 'not', 'character', 'who', 'self-destructed', 'caused', 'so', 'many', 'problems', 'WWE', 'WCW', 'Current', 'WWE', 'superstars', 'such', 'Chris', 'Jericho', 'Edge', 'Christian', 'also', 'add', 'reflections', 'watching', 'Warrior', 'tube', 'younger', 'days', 'what', 'effects', 'had', 'also', 'poke', 'little', 'fun', 'Warrior', 'cryptic', 'interviews', 'downright', 'ridiculous', 'storylines', 'was', 'involved', 'Wrestlemania', 'X8', 'DVD', 'though', 'know', 'seeing', 'Warrior', 'vs.', 'Hogan', 'Wrestlemania', 'VI', 'kid', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'Edge', 'finally', 'decide', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'wrestler', 'so', 'least', 'Warrior', 'made', 'difference', 'someone', 'life', 'end', 'documentary', 'truth', 'according', 'WWE', 'revealed', 'how', 'Warrior', 'was', 'so', 'successful.For', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'pleased', 'how', 'story', 'Warrior', 'downfall', 'was', 'presented', 'thought', 'interviewed', 'were', 'honest', 'sincere', 'opinions', 'Parts', 'doc', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'Warrior', 'most', 'well', 'memorable', 'moments', 'brought', 'few', 'laughs', 'as', 'well', 'found', 'wondering', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'Warrior', 'kid', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'alone', 'documentary', 'just', '1', 'hours', 'long', 'just', 'informative', 'enough', 'getting', 'boring', 'Extra', 'features', 'disc', 'include', 'additional', 'short', 'interviews', 'Jerry', 'King', 'Lawler', 'Ted', 'DiBiase', 'Christian', 'hilariously', 'reenacting', 'one', 'Warrior', 'most', 'disturbing', 'promos', '5', 'full', 'matches', 'two', 'are', 'less', 'minute', 'long-what', 'surprise', 'including', 'Hogan/', 'Warrior', 'Wrestlemania', 'VI', 'Retirement', 'Match', 'Macho', 'King', 'Randy', 'Savage', 'classics.Warrior', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'dig', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'old-school', 'wrestling', 'fan', 'who', 'pines', 'days', 'when', 'colorful', 'characters', 'were', 'more', 'important', 'shock', 'TV', ""'ll"", 'relive', 'good', 'stuff', 'here']",The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior
917369,A2TVJ0YDW3QO63,B000A0D1Q0,Dan McKinnon,"[120, 136]","First things first, I am was and still am a HUGE Ultimate Warrior fan.  I got back into wrestling from 1997-2002 (I still watch it here and there but no longer consider myself a fan any more) and cheered for wrestlers like The Rock before he was big all the way up until he left (probably the single biggest reason why I lost interest in WWE again).  Before that time I was a WWF fan from 1987-1993 and I absolutely loved the Ultimate Warrior.  Bar none, he is my favorite wrestler of all time, as short a moment in time as it was.I state this to make it known that I was extremely excited when I heard that WWE was releasing an Ultimate Warrior DVD, scouring the Internet for news on a daily basis to learn more about what was being released regarding my favorite wrestler of all time.  I knew that this was not going to be any love-fest by the WWE brain trust, but I didn't care.  Just the ability to see the warrior in the DVD format and have others talk about the individual that made moments of my sometimes crappy childhood filled with joy... it took me back to happy moments that you cannot easily feel again.After having rushed out to pick up ""The Self Destruction Of The Ultimate Warrior"" and watched the 1.5 hour special about his career in the ring, I find that it was a very FAIR assessment of Warrior's wrestling legacy.  Other Ultimate Warrior fans have written online that this DVD badmouths the former Mr. Hellwig and puts him in a light that isn't completely accurate.  In a situation of ""he said she said"" usually the truth lies somewhere in between so I am sure that this DVD isn't 100% accurate, but my overall impression of this disc is that it is very FAIR (and again, I remind you that I was about as a big a fan as there is of The Ultimate Warrior).Starting off with the origins of the Ultimate Warrior from Rock to Dingo Warrior to Ultimate Warrior, this DVD speaks of UW's quick rise from a house show wrestler to beating the Honky Tonk Man in 30 seconds at SummerSlam 1988 in Madison Square Garden.  Following Warrior's rise in popularity, the UW does the unthinkable on April 1, 1990 in Toronto, Canada at WrestleMania VI as he CLEANLY beats Hulk Hogan in the middle of the ring in what is the penultimate moment of my wrestling fan ""career"".  From this point on we learn how the Warrior defended that very title as best as he could (and I truly believe the Warrior did the best he could do), until he eventually lost it to Sgt. Slaughter and arguably then had the best match of his career with Randy Savage at WrestleMania VII.  The Ultimate Warrior's 1st run with the WWF came to an end in 1991 when (as the WWF and Vince claim - Warrior himself says this isn't true) during the SummerSlam PPV Warrior demanded more money or he wouldn't perform.  After a 7 month hiatus we see The Ultimate Warrior make his incredibly shocking return at the end of WM VIII to begin his 2nd run with the WWF which would only last a mere 8 months or so.  Warrior's last 2 runs at wrestling for major promotions are covered in his 4 month 1996 WWF run and his 3 month 1998 WCW run (he hasn't wrestled in a big promotion since that time).Throughout the history of UW's wrestling career we get comments from Vince McMahon, Eric Bischoff, Ted Dibiase, Bobby Heenan, Gene Okerlund, Jim Ross, Hulk Hogan, Bruce Pritchard, Jerry Lawler, Christian, Chris Jericho, Ric Flair and many others.  To say that these fellow wrestlers put Warrior in a bad light is like saying that rotten eggs smell bad.  It's quite evident that Jim (most of these guys refuse to call him Warrior unless it's with their eyes in the back of their heads) wasn't very popular in the back room, and never will be.But as I have said numerous times in this review, IT'S FAIR.You generally get the impression when someone is lying, and it's pretty evident that everyone on this DVD is speaking from their hearts.  They truly believe what they are telling the camera about the Ultimate Warrior and it is highly entertaining to say the least.As an individual that prides themselves on knowing as much as possible about The Ultimate Warrior, I learned new things about the man from Parts Unknown, more so than anything else, how little he was respected in the back room by ""the boys"".  As much as wrestling is for the fans, when it comes to the end of the day, the most important thing is how you interact with your little wrestling family in the back room.  The fans you see maybe  20 minutes a night, your fellow wrestlers the entire rest of the day.  It's a shame that as loved as the Warrior was from 1989-1991, he was so disliked by everyone else.If you read any of Warrior's posts on his web site (ultimatewarrior.com) he'll tell you over and over again how much he can't stand the WWF and that they are liars, but when you have so many people saying 1 thing and 1 other person saying another, you can't help but think that maybe the problem isn't everyone else.  Mr. Hellwig (sorry, WARRIOR) would have you believe that Vince has ""brainwashed"" his entire stable, but after watching this DVD you will probably feel otherwise.My only complaint is that as good as 1.5 hour feature is, this collection could have been even more.  It's quite clear that no ""double dipping"" will be done for another Ultimate Warrior DVD, so why not have matches on here like Warrior/Slaughter from Royal Rumble 1991, the complete Super Posedown from RR1989 with Rick Rude, more interview segments like when he gets hits by Honky Tonk in summer 1988, Rude at WMV, Hercules at WMIV, the whole Jake feud in 1991 and so forth?  There are a handful of matches on here including the 2 big ones with Hogan at WMVI (sadly Jesse Ventura's commentary had to be cut out) and Savage at WMVII, but this set of choices feels lacking.Overall, a very entertaining DVD that any Warrior fan should take a look at, and any wrestling fan that wants to learn more about the Ultimate Warrior shouldn't ignore (especially if you are ignorant of the story of Warrior).**** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",4,The Rise And Fall Of The Ultimate Warrior,1127865600,"09 28, 2005",2005,6020,"['First', 'things', 'first', 'am', 'was', 'still', 'am',

That basically describes this DVD about the Ultimate Warrior (which resulted in a lawsuit filed today) as it's ALMOST a complete burial on the man. I said it's an ""almost"" burial because certain people like Jericho & Christian did give him his respect on certain issues while people like Edge (who openly said he couldn't be a fan of Warrior's because of his allegiance to Hogan); Dibiase; Heenan; Lawler; McMahon & others just completely have nothing good to say at all. Just about everything about Warrior gets ripped on...ring entrance, wrestling skills, his bad career decisions, his bad attitude towards those in the locker room. His interviews are also touched upon as they focused on one he did leading up to WrestleMania VI (although on the DVD, they say it's the one he did at the event which it wasn't) including Christian doing a funny imitation of it.The one thing that is very noticeable is how WWE did somethings to make Warrior look worse than he actually did & alter information (showed flyers advertising ""WWF Champion Ultimate Warrior vs. Vader"" when Warrior wasn't champion when Vader was around back in '96), them mocking how he's from Parts Unknown when they currently have characters using that same ""location"" (like Kane) along with the little things he did like shaking the ropes (which Batista currently does as well.)Anyways, they discuss his time starting as Bladerunner Rock & Dingo Warrior all the way to his beginnings under Ultimate Warrior. His feuds with Hercules, Bobby Heenan in Weasel Suit matches, winning the Intercontinental Championship from Honky Tonk Man, feuds with Andre The Giant (Bobby tells a funny story regarding a match they had) & Rick Rude, the buildup to his match with Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania VI, feuds with Sgt. Slaughter & Randy Savage (who also has some shots taken at him) are covered along with the impact of his Intercontinental & WWE title reigns. It starts to go all downhill from here as they talk about the SummerSlam '91 incident; the name change to Warrior; his two returns to WWE including the train wreck feuds with Papa Shango & Jerry Lawler along with Triple H talking about his WrestleMania XII experience with Warrior; his lawsuit over the ownership of his name; and his short time in WCW including his HORRIBLE (and that's putting it lightly) match with Hollywood Hogan & they even talk about WCW's cheap Warrior ripoff in back in '95 called Renegade (RIP). At least on the positive side, you get some ""urban legends"" about Warrior answered like if there were ever two Ultimate Warriors & why he left WWF the second time.The DVD extras include the old Warrior University commercial followed by comments by McMahon on a visit to there; Lawler & Dibiase telling stories on the Warrior; Christian doing an old Warrior promo; and two hidden ""Unleash The Warrior"" promos that were done back in '96.Matches Include:vs. Terry Gibbs - This was nothing special past Warrior's television debut.""Wrestling Challenge"" Oct. '87vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion Honky Tonk Man - All I can say on this one is don't blink because you'll miss the longest Intercontinental Title reign end in seconds.SummerSlam '88(History Of Intercontinental Championship)""Title vs. Title"" Match vs. WWE Champion Hulk Hogan - This was at the time the most unique WWF Title match in history. The two most popular wrestlers in the company fought each other in the main event with both the Intercontinental & WWF Title on the line. This was one of the best Ultimate Warrior matches in his lifetime as they just told a great story & this is truly a classic even down the the fans being split right down the middle throughout the match.As a side note here, Jesse Ventura's commentary was removed from this match.WrestleMania VI(Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology, History Of The WWE Championship)WWE Championship/Steel Cage Match vs. Rick Rude - Warrior's first major challenger for his WWE Championship was the only man to have defeated Warrior over a year earlier for the Intercontinental Championship in the Ravishing One. Rude entered the cage first & made it so Warrior would have to fight through Rude just to get in the cage to start the match. This started out as a slugfest as both men were trading punches more than anything else before Rude was able to get an advantage over Warrior. Rude was more focused on just punishing Warrior instead of winning the championship as he had plenty of chances to just walk out of the cage (as Heenan at ringside kept yelling for him to do) before it eventually backfired on him to the point where even Bobby got involved to help Rude out. Anyone who was around to witness Ultimate Warrior knows that he was very limited in what he could do so this was as good as you expected it to be but still entertaining.SummerSlam '90Retirement Match vs. Randy Savage - Without a doubt, Ultimate Warrior's greatest opposition was always Randy Savage & this match is the perfect example as he gave Warrior one of the greatest matches (if not THE greatest match) in his career. This was back in the day when wrestling was still ""kayfabe"" so you were on the edge of your seat for over 20 mins. not knowing who was going to leave since you really couldn't see either guy away from WWE at that time. The match itself is one of the top quality matches on this set & in both mens careers.As another side note, the aftermath with Savage & Elizabeth is not shown here.WrestleMania VII(Macho Madness: Randy Savage Ultimate Collection)Collectors Edition Bonus Disc:vs. Hercules - Ted Dibiase referred to their series of matches as ""the blind leading the blind"" and he had a point here as it was just both men using their power against each other with it sometimes looking every stiff with both men at times looking lost at times too but you could tell that despite all of that, the crowd was still behind Warrior.""MSG"" Apr. '88vs. Sgt. Slaughter - With cameos from Hulk Hogan along with Undertaker & Paul Bearer with their casket personalized for Ultimate Warrior, this was one of those ""put a storyline over"" matches & was nothing more than to setup the post-WrestleMania feuds between all four men.""Saturday Night's Main Event"" Apr. '91vs. WWE Champion Randy Savage - I try not to use the word ""classic"" too much when it comes to Warrior but is his a lost classic when it comes to his career because as I said earlier, his greatest opposition was Randy Savage and that was the same case here. This was the WrestleMania VII rematch with the difference here in that both Savage & Warrior were babyfaces so they wrestled a different type of match than their Mania one with the factor of Mr. Perfect & Ric Flair being a ringside adding to the match.  This always gets overshadowed by that encounter over a year earlier but it's one match that is a lost classic in Warrior's career.SummerSlam '92I wish they added more matches on here like the SummerSlam '91 match with Hogan vs. Slaughter & co.; his WM12 match against HHH (only to laugh at HHH's expense); and his Sat. Night Main Event six man tag with L.O.D. vs. Demolition. But the purpose & focus was the documentary which they did. Basically, I would recommend this for any Warrior fan to get the truth on SOME (not all) issues regarding him or just to have a laugh at his expense. However, if your a fan of the more serious WWE documentaries then this is one that you should pass on.",3,This DVD Is Like A Train Wreck....,1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,7460,"['know', 'gon', 'na',

It's interesting that WWE devotes a whole DVD to a guy that generates such contempt, who according to luminaries like Jim Ross, Ted Dibiase and Bobby Heenan had very little to offer. So what we get is an entertaining undoubted hatchet job on an unpopular (at least backstage) performer who was an absolute superstar of his era-regardless of what various WWE peons say.You get the strong impression that a lot of the interviewee's (Flair, DiBiase) didn't actually know Warrior personally at all.This makes a fine companion piece to the Ringside's Warrior Shoot DVD that came out in 2005. On it Warrior is belligerent and almost adversarial, clearly he would be a prickly guy to deal with.BUT the simple facts are that Warriors recollection of some events seem a damn site more credible than the WWE's. For instance Jim Ross saying that Bill Watts territory was 'too physical' for Warrior is baloney, Warrior's recollection seems far more on the money. And as for the rubbish that Warrior was a dud wrestler-also complete garbage.

I still get chills & my heart races watching the closing moments of WrestleMania VI. ""The Self-Destruction Of The Ultimate Warrior"" is brutally honest. It takes a look at Jim Hellwig's career, touching on his start with Steve 'Sting' Borden as the 'Dingo' Warrior, & his various stints in other minor promotions before calling the WWF for a job. It covers some of the aspects of the Warrior that made him unique & appealing, like his ring enterances, & his extremely un-understandable interviews. Most of his major rivaleries & high spots are looked at, like Rick Rude, Andre The Giant, Bobby Heenan (who provides some awesome stories & insight though-out the DVD), his quick raise to the Intercontinental Title, his historic WWF Heavyweight Title victory, & other topics like why he left the WWF 3 times, his brief run in WCW, his horrible rematch against Hogan at 'Halloween Havoc', & more.Extras include 5 matches:Vs Terry Gibbs (debut match - note: no music, & he WALKS to the ring)Vs Honky Tonk Man (SummerSlam 88, if you've never seen it, don't blink or you'll miss it)Vs Hulk Hogan (WrestleMania VI, Title for Title)Vs Rick Rude (SummerSlam 90, Steel Cage)Vs Randy Savage (WrestleMania VII, 'Loser Must Retire' Match)& some stories:-Jerry Lawler tells a Warrior story from Memphis-a promo for Warrior University-Christian impersonates the Ultimate Warrior-Ted DiBiase tells about an autograph signing with WarriorPlus 2 hidden extras - both Warrior promos -- In chapters, left click 'The Name Change' for 'Unleash the Warrior'- In extra's, right click 'Warrior University' for 'The Journey Begins'I bought the FYE exclusive, which contains a bonus DVD with 3 more matches:Vs Hercules (MSG - 4/25/88)Vs Sgt.

917376,A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA,B000A0D1Q0,Ervin Griffin,"[4, 5]","I just purchased ""The Self-Destruction Of The Ultimate Warrior"" and I must say I kind of expected a complete ripping of the Warrior but I didn't get that! I've read where other reviewers thought the WWE was being unfair and biased on this one but I don't get that vibe at all. I think, for the most part, the assessment of UW was fair and probably pretty accurate.I do have to raise an eyebrow at a couple of things though. The first was Triple H. Granted, it was an old interview from 2000 the day of WrestleMania 2000 but I find it kind of ironic that he calls UW a ""d*ckwad"" since most fans tend to consider him the same (though I have to grudgingly admit he's far more talented that UW ever was).Back to the DVD itself, the bio is about an hour and a half long. I found Vince McMahon to be very informative in his explanation of his relationship with UW. Still have to wonder like a lot of fans WHY WOULD YOU KEEP BRINGING THIS GUY BACK KNOWING HIS REP?!I found the comments from Chris Jericho, Christian and even Edge to be very funny! The best UW story though had to be Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan's description of UW's matches with the late, great Andre The Giant! I won't give it away but it was quite humorous! I only wished they would have had the footage of that bout with the incident he described on this DVD! LOL!I also wonder how sincere Eric Bischoff and Hulk Hogan's explanation was for bringing in UW to the old WCW. They said it wasn't to give Hogan a victory over UW thus giving him peace of his old WrestleMania VI loss to him. I don't quite buy that since Eric Bischoff was really kissing Hogan's a** majorly at that time! As it turns out, UW was another nail in the coffin for WCW since by the time they brought him in in 1998, WWE (WWF at the time) had taken back the Monday Night Wars! Do have to agree with Bischoff though that Hogan/Warrior II was the WORST MATCH on that Halloween Havoc card! It really stunk up that joint that night!I should also note that this originally was set out to be a tribute to UW and he was even asked to participate in its making but he not only refused, he totally slammed WWE in doing so! So for all those that say this piece is biased, I say this: UW WAS OFFERED THE CHANCE TO TELL HIS SIDE OF THE STORY FOR THIS THING SO HE HAS NO ONE TO BLAME BUT HIMSELF IF THE DVD SEEMS ONE-SIDED!I have to confess I was also a fan of UW and it was kind of sad to see him fall apart like he did when he practically had the world at his feet but on the other hand, he did it to himself for the most part. Like it or not, WWE (in my opinion) did make him as well as the other superstars (particularly Rick Rude and Randy Savage). As they say, you reap what you sow. Still, his impact on wrestling in the early 90's cannot be denied.Anyway, overall, I think whether you are a fan or not of The Ultimate Warrior, this DVD is worth the money to watch whether you agree with what's said on here or not.As for the bonus bouts, here they are:MATCHESVs. Terry Gibbs - A squash match.Vs. The Honky Tonk Man - His I-C title win over HTM in 31 seconds!Vs. ""Ravishing"" Rick Rude (RIP) - This is their SummerSlam '90 cage bout for the WWE title!Vs. Hulk Hogan (WWE VS. I-C Title Match) - The historic WrestleMania 6 match up!Vs. ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage - The WrestleMania VII ""retirement"" matchBONUS FEATURES-Jerry Lawler tells of a story wrestling UW in Memphis-Vince McMahon recounts Warrior's failed Warrior University school-Ted DiBiase recounts an autograph session with UW in WCW.NEW INFORMATION:Well, probably not new by now but I only recently found out that there are TWO versions of this DVD. The first one is the one all the reviewers discussed but the other has the original disc PLUS a bonus disc only sold by FYE stores! On that disc are three more matches with UW:Vs. Hercules - This was from Madison Square Garden and took place weeks after their PPV encounter at WrestleMania IV (1988). In my opinion, this bout is what their WM match should've been with a great finish!Vs. Sgt. Slaughter - This is from the old NBC show ""Saturday Night's Main Event."" In addition to Col. Mustafa (The Iron Shiek) and Gen. Adnan, it also features run-ins from Hulk Hogan and The Undertaker!Vs. ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage (WWE Title Match) - This is a rematch of sorts from WrestleMania VII. Their last PPV bout was the retirement match from that bout in 1991. This SummerSlam rematch was in 1992 from England! Was just as good as their WM bout. Features run-ins from ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair and ""Mr. Perfect"" Curt Hennig (RIP).",5,Fair & Funny Look Back,1128729600,"10 8, 2005",2005,4555,"['just', 'purchased', 'Self-Destruction', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'must', 'say', 'kind', 'expected', 'complete', 'ripping', 'Warrior', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', ""'ve"", 'read', 'where', 'other', 'reviewers', 'thought', 'WWE', 'was', 'being', 'unfair', 'biased', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'vibe', 'think', 'most', 'part', 'assessment', 'UW', 'was', 'fair', 'probably', 'pretty', 'accurate.I', 'do', 'have', 'raise', 'eyebrow', 'couple', 'things', 'first', 'was', 'Triple', 'H.', 'Granted', 'was', 'old', 'interview', '2000', 'day', 'WrestleMania', '2000', 'find', 'kind', 'ironic', 'd*ckwad', 'most', 'fans', 'tend', 'consider', 'same', 'have', 'grudgingly', 'far', 'more', 'talented', 'UW', 'ever', 'was', '.Back', 'DVD', 'bio', 'hour', 'half', 'long', 'found', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'be', 'very', 'informative', 'explanation', 'relationship', 'UW', 'Still', 'have', 'wonder', 'lot', 'fans', 'WHY', 'WOULD', 'YOU', 'KEEP', 'BRINGING', 'THIS', 'GUY', 'BACK', 'KNOWING', 'HIS', 'REP', 'found', 'comments', 'Chris', 'Jericho', 'Christian', 'even', 'Edge', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'best', 'UW', 'story', 'had', 'be', 'Bobby', 'Brain', 'Heenan', 'description', 'UW', 'matches', 'late', 'great', 'Andre', 'Giant', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'was', 'quite', 'humorous', 'only', 'wished', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'footage', 'bout', 'incident', 'described', 'DVD', 'LOL', 'also', 'wonder', 'how', 'sincere', 'Eric', 'Bischoff', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'explanation', 'was', 'bringing', 'UW', 'old', 'WCW', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'give', 'Hogan', 'victory', 'UW', 'thus', 'giving', 'peace', 'old', 'WrestleMania', 'VI', 'loss', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'buy', 'Eric', 'Bischoff', 'was', 'really', 'kissing', 'Hogan', 'a**', 'majorly', 'time', 'out', 'UW', 'was', 'nail', 'coffin', 'WCW', 'time', 'brought', '1998', 'WWE', 'WWF', 'time', 'had', 'taken', 'back', 'Monday', 'Night', 'Wars', 'Do', 'have', 'agree', 'Bischoff', 'Hogan/Warrior', 'II', 'was', 'WORST', 'MATCH', 'Halloween', 'Havoc', 'card', 'really', 'stunk', 'up', 'joint', 'night', 'should', 'also', 'note', 'originally', 'was', 'set', 'out', 'be', 'tribute', 'UW', 'was', 'even', 'asked', 'participate', 'making', 'not', 'only', 'refused', 'totally', 'slammed', 'WWE', 'doing', 'so', 'So', 'say', 'piece', 'biased', 'say', 'UW', 'WAS', 'OFFERED', 'THE', 'CHANCE', 'TO', 'TELL', 'HIS', 'SIDE', 'THE', 'STORY', 'FOR', 'THIS', 'THING', 'SO', 'HE', 'NO', 'ONE', 'TO', 'BLAME', 'BUT', 'HIMSELF', 'IF', 'THE', 'DVD', 'SEEMS', 'ONE-SIDED', 'have', 'confess', 'was', 'also', 'fan', 'UW', 'was', 'kind', 'sad', 'see', 'fall', 'apart', 'did', 'when', 'practically', 'had', 'world', 'feet', 'other', 'hand', 'did', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'WWE', 'opinion', 'did', 'make', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'superstars', 'particularly', 'Rick', 'Rude', 'Randy', 'Savage', 'say', 'reap', 'what', 'sow', 'Still', 'impact', 'wrestling', 'early', '90', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied.Anyway', 'overall', 'think', 'are', 'fan', 'not', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'DVD', 'money', 'watch', 'agree', 'what', 'said', 'here', 'not.As', 'bonus', 'bouts', 'here', 'are', 'MATCHESVs', 'Terry', 'Gibbs', 'squash', 'match.Vs', 'Honky', 'Tonk', 'Man', 'I-C', 'title', 'win', 'HTM', '31', 'seconds', 'Vs', 'Ravishing', 'Rick', 'Rude', 'RIP', 'SummerSlam', 'cage', 'bout', 'WWE', 'title', 'Vs', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'WWE', 'VS.', 'I-C', 'Title', 'Match', 'historic', 'WrestleMania', '6', 'match', 'up', 'Vs', 'Macho', 'Man', 'Randy', 'Savage', 'WrestleMania', 'VII', 'retirement', 'FEATURES-Jerry', 'Lawler', 'tells', 'story', 'wrestling', 'UW', 'Memphis-Vince', 'McMahon', 'Warrior', 'failed', 'Warrior', 'University', 'school-Ted', 'DiBiase', 'autograph', 'session', 'UW', 'WCW.NEW', 'INFORMATION', 'Well', 'probably', 'not', 'new', 'now', 'only', 'recently', 'found', 'out', 'are', 'TWO', 'versions', 'DVD', 'first', 'one', 'one', 'reviewers', 'discussed', 'other', 'original', 'disc', 'PLUS', 'bonus', 'disc', 'only', 'sold', 'FYE', 'stores', 'disc', 'are', 'three', 'more', 'matches', 'UW', 'Vs.', 'Hercules', 'was', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'took', 'place', 'weeks', 'PPV', 'encounter', 'WrestleMania', 'IV', '1988', 'opinion', 'bout', 'what', 'WM', 'match', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'finish', 'Vs', 'Sgt', 'Slaughter', 'old', 'NBC', 'show', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Main', 'Event', 'addition', 'Col.', 'Mustafa', 'Iron', 'Shiek', 'Gen.', 'Adnan', 'also', 'run-ins', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'Undertaker', 'Vs', 'Macho', 'Man', 'Randy', 'Savage', 'WWE', 'Title', 'Match', 'rematch', 'sorts', 'WrestleMania', 'VII', 'last', 'PPV', 'bout', 'was', 'retirement', 'match', 'bout', '1991', 'SummerSlam', 'rematch', 'was', '1992', 'England', 'Was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'WM', 'bout', 'Features', 'run-ins', 'Nature', 'Boy', 'Ric', 'Flair', 'Mr', 'Perfect', 'Curt', 'Hennig', 'RIP']",The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior
917377,A25HC5H3SU46J0,B000A0D1Q0,"Evan Nelson ""Evan""","[0, 0]","WWE's ""The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior"" documentary, while not being as good as the ECW or Road Warriors docs, is at least funny and entertaining for most of its hour and a half running time. Highlights include: the segment on Warrior's insane interviews in which Christian, Edge & Y2J give hilarious imitations; comments by Hulk Hogan on Warrior's WCW run & their terrible match at Halloween Havoc 98; and pretty much anything Mean Gene or Bobby Heenan say. This DVD is worth a look especially if you grew up a Warrior fan. Now to the bonus matches.1. vs. Terry Gibbs (DUD out of *****)This is Warrior's debut on Wrestling challenge I believe. Total squash and not entertaining in the least. Only here for historical purposes I guess.2. vs. Honky Tonk Man (DUD)This is from SummerSlam 88. Warrior wins the I-C title in less than 30 seconds. Significant only because this was Warrior's first title.3. vs. WWF champ Hulk Hogan (***)This is the famous match from Wrestlemania VI in SkyDome. Much better than could possibly be expected from these two. Yeah there were probably only 5 wrestling holds total, but its fun to remember how awesome this was when I was 10 and watching this for the first time, not knowing who was gonna win.4. vs. Rick Rude, Steel Cage match (**)This is a Warrior title defense from SummerSlam 90. At only about 10 minutes, this was kinda short for a WWF title match. Some decent action here, including Rude jumping from the top of the cage twice, but this just never feels like a main event. Not terrible but not that good either.5. vs. Randy Savage, Loser must Retire (****)From WrestleMania VII; This is without a doubt the Warrior's greatest match. Of course Savage carries the action but the Warrior plays his part as well. Another one of those matches that is not so great from the workrate perspective but entertains none-the-less. I still get hyped up when Savage drops the elbow 5 times and the Warrior still kicks out. Ahhhh...Sweet memories! The best match on the DVD.My DVD came from FYE and came with a bonus disc that contains 3 extra matches.1. vs. Hercules (*)This is from MSG in 1988 a few weeks after their match at WrestleMania IV. I guess this match is included because the feud between these two was discussed in the documentary. Match lasts just shy of 15 minutes which is waaaay too long for these two. Not really worth watching more than once.2. vs. Sgt. Slaughter (1/2*)This match is from Saturday Night's Main Event not the Royal Rumble. Terrible match which is only notable for the appearance of The Undertaker who was feuding with the Warrior at the time. Warrior wins by DQ when Mustafa, Adnan and Undertaker interfere. Why not just give us the Rumble match instead?3. vs. WWF champ Randy Savage (**1/2)From SummerSlam 92. Not nearly as good as their career match but still not bad. Gets interesting half way in when Flair and Perfect come down to ringside. This was the match in which Perfect was supposedly going to be in the corner of either Savage or Warrior. Turns out he was just working them against each other to benefit Flair. Only good match on the bonus disc.",4,The truth hurts.

917378,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B000A0D1Q0,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[13, 15]","THE SELF-DESTRUCTION OF THE ULTIMATE WARRIORAfter being one of the most famous talked about wrestlers in the history of the sport it seemed as if we would never hear about The Warrior again after his short stint in WCW. But ah a form of filmmaking called the documentary as brought to life the memory of one of professional wrestling's most colorful forgotten figures. It seems like yesterday I was seeing the Warrior battle the likes of Ravishing Rick Rude, Andre The Giant, Hulk Hogan, Sgt Slaughter, and The Macho Man {at the time Macho King} Randy Savage. The last one in particular was the most exciting of his feuds, and I in particular was disappointed when The Warrior came out on top. Savage has always been a personal fav of mine, and I wish he had won that feud. But with that bias aside I have always found Warrior to be an entertaining figure.One of the things I found that interested me the most was that he started out on his own as The Dingo Warrior in Dallas TX. I always knew that Warrior started out his career with Sting, but as a soloist it seems weird that The Ultimate One was once called Dingo. So that was the first surprise to me offered from this documentary, though that was far from the most surprising. One thing I enjoyed most from this DVD was all of the early video footage of Warrior; it seemed weird seeing him in the early stages of the development of his character. They even called him The Dingo Warrior in his earlier matches with WWE {I still say WWF}. The story of how he got the name change from Dingo to Ultimate was some what interesting seeing that Vince did the opposite of what he wanted. If you listen to what is said they say that didn't want another Warrior, since Animal & Hawk, and Kerry Von Eric already had that title in some way. But since he was more energetic, he was that much more ULTIMATE-hence the name. Also I found it interesting that nobody really liked the guy, especially The Weasel Bobby Heenan. The things he said about Warrior surprised the heck out of me, also I loved the footage of the weasel suit match. Also the fact that Andre knocked the crap out of him struck me funny, also a surprise Andre didn't like him. Let me stop and take time to ask a question, if you were the top guy in a major entertainment company, would you risk your career by not performing unless you get more money? Here's a better question would you do it minutes before you had to go on, I wouldn't but this guy did. I absolutely agree with Vince's decision to fire him, but I kinda wish Hogan's idea would have been carried out, because that was mad crooked. But to Vince's credit he gave Warrior another chance as any one who saw WRESTELMANIA 8 would know, as he returned to aid Hulk Hogan. Of course it seems that Warrior had a bit of a drug problem and again he was shown the door. And being the forgiving sole that Vince is he got a third and final chance. We all remember the short lived 96 Warrior who had his own comic book, cussed, and actually spoke were you could understand him {at times}, even wore the out of place cap. But even with victories over Vader, and then I-C Champ Goldust, he still skipped out and refused to show at promoted events. So with that said his glory days of the WWE came to an end, but that wasn't the end of his career. Remember the OWN {One Warrior Nation}, me neither. It took watching his return to wrestling with WCW to remind me. Of course with a name like that, it seems funny that there were TWO members in the ONE Warrior Nation, The Disciple was the second. Watching the footage from Nitro brought me back to that time period, and made me remember how great the hype was but how boring the actual rematch between Warrior & Hogan was. Next question for ya, if you had a history of being fired, and were very unreliable would you want way more money then any company would give you. My answer would be no, I would be happy to be employed in the big time again. So Warrior is gone, but that isn't the surprising thing, that would be his name change. This guy actually changed his legal name to Warrior, what the hell. And in a further attempt to keep his name he sued the WWE for millions for the right to his wrestling identity.With all that aside the DVD actually has some great moments that highlight the man's career and also some humorous ones as well. Like the Ultimate Warrior's interviews, I actually never really noticed how crazy they were until I revisited them in the form of this documentary. To be honest some of them were actually good and made sense, well at least sounded cool I guess. And also the thing about him being from parts unknown was pretty funny, especially the guest speakers on the film like Jericho and Gene Okarland. But this DVD also includes great moments though out his career, like his classic feud with Randy Savage, his win over Hogan at Wrestlemania 6, and feuds with Rick Rude, Slaughter, and The Million Dollar Man. The DVD also includes 5 matches in their entirety, including Warrior vs, Terry Gibbs on Wrestling Challenge, vs Honky Tonk Man at Summerslam 88 for the I-C title, vs Hogan at Wrestlemania 6 title vs title, vs Rude at Summerslam 90 in a cage for the title, and vs Savage at Wrestlemania 7 in a retirement match.This is with out a doubt one of the best documentaries I have seen in a long time, I recommend it to every body. Also Christian doing the Warrior interview was great.",5,THE ULTIMATE DOCUMENTRY,1132617600,"11 22, 2005",2005,5424,"['SELF-DESTRUCTION', 'THE', 'ULTIMATE', 'WARRIORAfter', 'being', 'one', 'most',

917379,ABUR3EENOAHQY,B000A0D1Q0,Ireview,"[3, 4]","There are three sides to the story. WWE's, UW's and the Truth. This is WWE's side. I think the extra disc should have been included since it is unlikely another warrior dvd will ever be released. WWE is obviously slanted in telling the story but it is to be expected. UW's side would probably be the same. The whole truth will never be told.Hogan was very complimentary throughout the dvd. UW opened the door for short term wrestlers.

I've read a article by the Ultimate Warrior( and yes that is his legal name now) that he would never bow down and help make money for Vince.

The man quit the business three times and never seemed to stay-put in the World Wrestling Federation for more than a few months at at time.  The interesting thing about this DVD is it provides insight into just HOW self-destructive the man now known simply as ""Warrior"" was.  Gathering interviews from other wrestlers (Hulk Hogan, Triple H, Ric Flair) as well as commentators such as Mean Gene Okerlund and Vince McMahon, this DVD tracks the intense career of the Ultimate Warrior and shows that the man just wasn't able to handle the quick success.  It's that evolution, rather than the wrestler himself, that make this an enjoyable package.At times, the documentary seems like it's almost out-to-get the Warrior and it is blatantly and unapologetically one-sided.  Yet it is captivating nonetheless.  There are also several matches included that basically show the evolution of the Ultimate Warrior's in-ring style and persona.  He was a mediocre wrestler at best, but made up for his lack of technical skill with a super-hero persona that was a huge hit with the fans. He was far from ""The Next Hulk Hogan"" as the wrestling industry hoped.  But he certainly had his own style worthy of study.The only complaint with the DVD is, like all WWE DVDs, the matches.  They are interesting but they definitely leave you wishing for more.

Especially Bobby the Brain Heenan's interview where he talks about Warrior's matches with Andre the Giant. Jericho is good as well. He handles it as if he's on another VH1 top 80's moments.Some more matches should've been included as extras though.

Seriously why would you pay money to see something about a guy you either love and don't want to see badmouthed, or a guy you hate and don't wanna waste either the time or money on.  Curiosity is the only thing I can think of, I was curious too and felt cheated.  NOBODY in the world needs to have a DVD released about what a loser he supposedly is OR claim that he's a coward when he doesn't want to appear on your programming AFTER the video is out to defend himself.There is also NOTHING on this disc that even says that Warrior was asked to participate with the project.  That seriously undermines the intentions of this video since the opposing side isn't there to back up the claims.  Hell even Bischoff shows up on the Rise and Fall ECW DVD to defend his company stealing ECW's talent.The video convinently glosses over some things like his departure in 92, McMahon says there was a ""drug test and a violation"" YEAH, McMahon coming under the gun for distributing steroids to workers and when Warrior wanted to do something else, McMahon fired him and Davey Boy Smith and pointed the finger at them.  The Summerslam 91 match where Vince ""as I recall"" read LIE says he demanded more money or he wouldn't show.  Big rumors go around saying Warrior wanted money for shows he's already done and McMahon hadn't paid up yet.  Triple H says he's the most unprofessional guy ever to work with, yeah well Triple H in 96 was on the outs with WWE and Vince wanted Warrior to squash him.Too many people in the disc (many of whom were kids when Warrior was around so what the hell are they doing on here?) harp about Warrior being too intense and having little skills.  In a business thats known for intense guys, whoes the most intense there was, WARRIOR.  When WWE pushes guys to the moon that usually don't have the GREATEST technical skills and usually rely on brawling and power attacks, who had this repitoire?  WARRIOR.  Who is one of the few guys who Hogan EVER put over clean.  WARRIOR.  Yeah this guy sucks alright.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not the biggest fan of this guy but c'mon WWE your fooling nobody.You know WHY WWE can get away with this, it's cause Warriors an easy target.  WWE couldn't get along with him, the troublemakers at WCW used him, TNA Impact gave him a hard time and that with his recent speaking tours where he lets loose with some inflamitory things, makes him okay to target.  Try doing this with an equally big name in the business like Hogan, make a DVD about all his backstage politicking and frail ego or how guys like Benoit and Kidman never got a break with him around.  You'll never see it happen.Purely a curiosity and nothing more, it WAS fun to see old WWE footage but thats about it.  Don't waste your time.

If you are a fan of classic wrestling, I would highly recommend it.  If you are/ were a fan of the Ultimate Warrior, this DVD is an absolute must.The DVD is about the Ultimate Warrior's rise and fall from fame, but it also showcases many of the wrestlers of the time, including some really funny interviews.  It is very well done and brought back many memories for me of when I was young and a huge wrestling fan.  I loved it.OK, this is a one sided documentary and it is clear that the Ultimate Warrior and the WWE did not have a great working relationship.  However, I believe that everyone interviewed gave a good account of what transpired.  I really don't think that anyone on this DVD was mean spirited or took low blows at the Ultimate Warrior with maybe a couple of exceptions being Bobby Heenen and Rick Flair.  Even Vince McMahon came across as light hearted about what transpired and did not seem to hold much ill will towards the Ultimate Warrior.  And there were some moments where some of those interviewed admitted to liking him and enjoying working with him (Hulk Hogan comes to mind).  Basically, everyone thought he was just crazy.Admittedly, some parts seemed a bit unfair to the Ultimate Warrior.  I mean, they go on and on making fun of his interviews.  Yes he was clearly ""out there"", but how many wrestlers say anything of importance in their interviews.  It is usually a bunch of nonsense and lunacy.  That's what it's all about.  Then they say that the Ultimate Warrior was a ""flash in the pan"" despite him being in the WWF for over 7 years and being involved in wrestling for well over a decade.  They make it seem that the Ultimate Warrior was a short timer and talk about how he could have had a long run if he had been more professional, etc.  Let's face it, most wrestlers burn out and can only remain popular for so long.  MOST of the guys from the 80's are nowhere to be found with very few exceptions.  As for his wrestling skills, they make it seem like he was horrible, but in the next segment admit how great some of his matches were.But again, I give the WWE credit for coming out with this DVD and they definitely pay respect to the Ultimate Warrior and what he brought to the table.  Even Vince McMahon, who states he was royally scr@wed by him, admits that the Ultimate Warrior made a huge mark on wrestling.Get this DVD, sit back with a cold beer and enjoy some classic wrestling memories...",5,A must have DVD...,1183248000,"07 1, 2007",2007,2560,"['First', 'foremost', 'just', 'wanted', 'say', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'minute', 'are', 'fan', 'classic', 'wrestling', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'are/', 'were', 'fan', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'DVD', 'absolute', 'must.The', 'DVD', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'rise', 'fall', 'fame', 'also', 'many', 'wrestlers', 'time', 'including', 'really', 'funny', 'interviews', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'brought', 'back', 'many', 'memories', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'huge', 'wrestling', 'fan', 'loved', 'it.OK', 'one', 'sided', 'documentary', 'clear', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'WWE', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'great', 'working', 'relationship', 'However', 'believe', 'everyone', 'interviewed', 'gave', 'good', 'account', 'what', 'transpired', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'DVD', 'was', 'mean', 'spirited', 'took', 'low', 'blows', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'maybe', 'couple', 'exceptions', 'being', 'Bobby', 'Heenen', 'Rick', 'Flair', 'Even', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'came', 'light', 'hearted', 'what', 'transpired', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'hold', 'much', 'ill', 'will', 'towards', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'were', 'moments', 'where', 'interviewed', 'admitted', 'liking', 'enjoying', 'working', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'mind', 'Basically', 'everyone', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'crazy.Admittedly', 'parts', 'seemed', 'bit', 'unfair', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'mean', 'go', 'making', 'fun', 'interviews', 'was', 'clearly', 'there', 'how', 'many', 'wrestlers', 'say', 'anything', 'importance', 'interviews', 'usually', 'bunch', 'nonsense', 'lunacy', 'what', 'about', 'Then', 'say', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'was', 'flash', 'pan', 'being', 'WWF', '7', 'years', 'being', 'involved', 'wrestling', 'well', 'decade', 'make', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'was', 'short', 'timer', 'talk', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'long', 'run', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'professional', 'etc', 'Let', 'face', 'most', 'wrestlers', 'burn', 'out', 'can', 'only', 'remain', 'popular', 'so', 'long', 'MOST', 'guys', '80', 'are', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'very', 'few', 'exceptions', 'wrestling', 'skills', 'make', 'was', 'horrible', 'next', 'segment', 'admit', 'how', 'great', 'matches', 'were.But', 'again', 'give', 'WWE', 'credit', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'pay', 'respect', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'what', 'brought', 'table', 'Even', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'who', 'was', 'royally', 'scr', '@', 'wed', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'made', 'huge', 'mark', 'wrestling.Get', 'DVD', 'sit', 'back', 'cold', 'beer', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'wrestling', 'memories']",The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior

When I used to watch there wasn't an admission that anything had been staged. This documentary was sponsored by Vince McMahon/WWE and ends up taking a few shots at The Ultimate Warrior who declined to participate. However, there is plenty of footage of him climbing the ranks towards the title and eventually fading away. I was quite surprised and learned a lot about the real business of wrestling. Most people know about it now anyway but the backstage areas could be notorious. I have no doubt Jim is difficult in person but there isn't a totally balanced perspective in here. It's great to see some legends like Hulk Hogan, Sgt. Slaughter, Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan and others.

917395,A23FXW3H8FR789,B000A0D1Q0,Nathan D. Ludwig,"[37, 51]","If you're one of the clueless out there that think The Ultimate Warrior was one of the greatest wrestlers of all time, then this DVD is probably not for you...But if you're one of the sensible out there that know the Warrior was a slightly entertaining, mildly diverting, talentless musclehead who made no sense on the mic or in the ring at all, then you'll most likely enjoy this minor but amusing mini-documentary and handful of matches and extras.Sure, he might seem interesting to little kids back in his heyday, but anyone over the age of twelve can see through this guy and know he's even less skilled as a pro-wrestler than Hulk Hogan. But thankfully he was never as bad as Lex Luger. No one's that bad...This 1-disc DVD features about a 70-minute WWE-produced ""documentary"" on the rise and fall and rise and fall and rise and fall of one of the strangest wrestlers to ever appear in The Fed. It features interviews with many different WWE personalities, from Eric Bischoff and Vince McMahon himself to Jim Ross, Jerry Lawler, Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, The Brooklyn Brawler, Ted DiBiase, Christian, Bobby Heenan, Edge, Chris Jericho and Gene Okerlund. There's also some archive interview footage of Triple H talking about his squash match with Warrior at WM XII where he jobbed for Warrior in a quick, forgettable match. I didn't like that part too much, since Hunter is still with the company and could have easily done another quick interview on the subject that was up to date and not half a decade old.Some people might complain that this shouldn't have been released without interviewing The Warrior himself. But seriously, besides for comic relief, would you really want to hear his nonsensical ravings about things that either probably never happened or are blown way out of proportion? I didn't think so...Of course, since this is an official WWE DVD, it is going to be biased toward the WWE side of things, naturally. However, this is not a ""burial job"" of The Warrior like everyone is saying it is. Anyone who grew up or watched wrestling during the Warrior's time in and out of WWE and WCW knew he was as difficult to work with as Val Kilmer and even stranger cutting a promo or doing an interview. The best part of the DVD shows some of his weirdest promos ever, with guys like Jericho, Edge, Christian and Heenan commenting on their silliness. Very funny stuff...Overall, the documentary is light and fluffy, nothing too heady or controversial. It goes through his early days tagging with Sting and then his debut with WWF, taking the belt from the greatest IC champ of all time, The Honkytonk Man in one of the quickest squashes ever. Then it goes through his feuds with Ted DiBiase and Ravishing Rick Rude for the IC belt. Notice how he gets paired with wrestlers who can actually work in the ring? What a coincidence...It also goes into his international touring feud with Andre The Giant and this is also one of the better parts of the DVD, with Heenan telling a great story on how Andre got Warrior to ""play ball."" The world title win over Hulk Hogan is the centerpiece of the feature, then going into his main event feuds with Sergeant Slaughter and Randy Savage. I don't know about you, but some of my favorite moments in the WWE were back during the Royal Rumble/Wrestlemania period of 1991 when the Warrior and Savage faced off with some of the most jumbled, head-scratching, hilariously cryptic promos ever. So I guess they were a natural fit...The DVD talks about that fact as well quite humorously.The doc ends with The Warrior leaving and returning and leaving and returning over and over again through the WWE and into WCW in a well-done segment. It only soldifies the argument that The Warrior was strange, self-centered, knew nothing about the business and was a terrible worker in the ring. His rise to fame and glory would have lasted longer if he weren't so volatile behind the scenes and actually tried to improve his in-ring skills. Ric Flair, Bobby Heenan and Ted DiBiase had some very frank and candid comments on their opinion of The Warrior; and they weren't the complimentary kind...I'm sure a lot of people out there will make the argument that the WWE is just playing the bias card with this DVD, retelling wrestling history in their own image, not being to fair to the former Jim Hellwig and making him out to be worse than he really was. If that's true, then answer me this: is there any evidence over the last fifteen or so years to the contrary? Not one. Just check out his loony website or the shoot interview DVD that just came out or just check the internet for his college speaking tour videos. All of them are totally out there and painful to read/watch.The DVD is rounded out with a few outtakes and 5 matches. The first two, one of his WWF debut against Terry Gibbs and the other his IC title win over Honky are mercifully short. The others...Not so much...Warrior versus Hogan at 'Mania VI is one of the worst main event matches in terms of actual in-ring wrestling. Hogan put on a better show with HBK at SummerSlam 2005. But he was in the ring with HBK, not Warrior. You do the math. The best match on here is Rick Rude versus Warrior for the IC title in a steel cage from SummerSlam 1990. Rude was one of the best workers in the WWF at the time and it shows here as he carries the clumsy, clueless Warrior through arguably UW's best match ever (if you can call a match featuring the Warrior good, that is). The final match is Warrior versus Savage in a retirement match. Unless you're five years old, retirement matches are retarded because we all know that even if they lose, they'll be back again some day. This is a decent match, carried by Savage who is severely underrated as one of the better workers of the Golden Period of the WWE: the late 80's thru the early 90's.Bottom Line: The Self-Destruction Of The Ultimate Warrior is a light and fun disc if you're looking to reaffirm your opinion that the Warrior was a no-talent, insane bodybuilder posing as a wrestler and looking for some chuckles to get you through the day. It's also a nice nostalgia trip for those of us who cut our teeth during the late 80's and early 90's of WWE programming. It's sad to see that today's cards can hardly compare to back then. If you're a Warrior fan, you might want to look elsewhere for your fix...",3,"A Fun WWE Mini-Doc...Nothing More, Nothing Less...",1128988800,"10 11, 2005",2005,6354,"[""'re"", 'one', 'clueless',

I think the comments and interviews were as fair as can be without the warrior giving his side of things. You have to remember warrior made a CHOICE not to participate in any of this. you will learn some things you might have not known and christian does a good impression of the warrior. I gave it 3 stars becuase the lack of matches. only a few matches and there all the matches we have seen before. Also for the fact that again warrior decided to not want anything to do with the dvd. unlike lets say  bret hart who decided to bury the hacthet and help out in his upcoming dvd set. this dvd is good and i recomend this to anyone that grew up in the era.,3,Good for the memories!!,1128384000,"10 4, 2005",2005,729,"['dvd', 'pretty', 'good', 'far', 'not', 'best', 'wwe', 'dvd', 'good', 'think', 'comments', 'interviews', 'were', 'as', 'fair', 'can', 'be', 'warrior', 'giving', 'side', 'things', 'have', 'remember', 'warrior', 'made', 'CHOICE', 'not', 'participate', 'will', 'learn', 'things', 'might', 'have', 'not', 'known', 'christian', 'good', 'impression', 'warrior', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'becuase', 'lack', 'matches', 'only', 'few', 'matches', 'matches', 'have', 'seen', 'Also', 'fact', 'again', 'warrior', 'decided', 'not', 'want', 'anything', 'do', 'dvd', 'lets', 'say', 'bret', 'hart', 'who', 'decided', 'bury', 'hacthet', 'help', 'out', 'upcoming', 'dvd', 'set', 'dvd', 'good', 'i', 'recomend', 'anyone', 'grew', 'up', 'era']",The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior

Then all of the sudden, the paid WWE guys just began to bad-mouth the Warrior. Maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved?  They take some very low blows. They say that the Warrior was a bad wrestler. Actually he seemed just fine to me when I was young, and I really can't distinguish one's ability from the other. They just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations. Vince says quickly that the reason why the Ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test. As soon as he says this, they fade to black then come back with a new issue. What drug use? Which drugs? Presumably they're talking about steroids. But what about that high and mighty Hulk Hogan with his admitted drug use. Let's not talk about that - let's just keep ganging up on the Warrior. They completely ridicule him changing his name to the Warrior. And they also just try to badmouth him so much. Who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him? I don't! He excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including Hulk. And oh yeah - they don't even let the Warrior defend himself.  Why did I have to find out from IMDB.com that he was asked to appear but declined? Why don't they address this?  This ""docu"" is more slanted than ""Fahrenheitt 911"" Every wrestling and Ultimate Warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it.

917399,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B000A0D1Q0,R.A. McKenzie,"[4, 9]","I'm not the most credible reviewer of this DVD, because I don't really remember The Ultimate Warrior.  I remember knowing about him and seeing his promos, but I can't say that I vividly recall any of his matches or speeches (apparently, nobody understood the speeches, either).  From ""WreslteMania XII"" until his run in the WCW is the only time period I can honestly admit to watching The Ultimate Warrior.  So what kind of effect does this DVD documentary have on a viewer like me?  To me, this documentary doesn't seem like such a big deal.Today's viewers will probably not like this documentary that much.  That's not an insult...but many younger viewers don't seem to really get into yester-year's form of patient and strategic wrestling.  I, too, can admit that I like twice as many matches from this decade than from the 80s and 90s combined.  So, while the trip back to 80s pop culture and sports entertainment was intriguing, for me it wasn't much of an eye-opener.Listening to younger Superstars (Edge, Christian, and Chris Jericho) is a nice addition to the interviews, because most of those who comment are retired legends (Sergeant Slaughter, Ted DiBiase) and executives (Bruce Prichard, Vince McMahon).  Everybody on this DVD seems to be honest and fair.  What doesn't work, though, is that they tend to get repetitive.  Listening to 10 guys say the exact same thing in a row gets to be grating.  Re-emphasizing points is often more supportive; this documentary makes re-emphasis more annoying, because listening to 10 people with identical points-of-view is too one-sided.  I understand that Jim Hellwig refused to comment on this DVD (though he makes appearances and gives lectures at colleges), but where's the diversity.  The only commentator who throws in a little variety is Chris Jericho, because he admits at the end that The Ultimate Warrior is one his all-time favorites.But even that last point brings up another problem: This documentary does not convince me that The Ultimate Warrior was that great.  I saw his overly-short matches, which make Goldberg's and John Cena's matches look epic, and was not impressed.  I was into gimmicks as much as everybody else, but Randy Savage and Jake Roberts and Ted DiBiase all put on a spectacular show with their gimmicks.  The Ultimate Warrior simply does not impress me.  His bonus matches aren't even stellar (with the exception of ""WrestleMania VI"" against Hulk Hogan).I guess what I'm getting at is that if the WWF and WCW were too stupid to learn that Jim Hellwig was in the business for himself and not the fans who made popular, then why listen to 90 minutes of regret and half-assed praise?  What is the tragic rise-and- fall of The Ultimate Warrior supposed to leave me with?  This is where I refer to ""The Rise and Fall of ECW"", and other biographies like ""The Monday Night War"" or ""Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story"".  Those mentioned documentaries had a message, with enough to support either side of the argument, and left us with a satisfactory overview.  ""The Self-Destruction of The Ultimate Warrior"" first gets biographical, then becomes VH-1 comical with a Parts Unknown segment, then frankly insulting The Ultimate Warrior.  What is the WWE trying to do to The Ultimate Warrior?  Jim Hellwig may have destroyed his own legacy, but I wish I could better appreciate what the legacy was.  Then, the tragic fall and career-killing decisions that Hellwig made would be more effective, and perhaps shocking.  But this documentary immediately points out Jim Hellwig's faults, and foreshadows his downfall.I kind of enjoyed this documentary, but couldn't help but feel shortchanged.  WWE DVD doesn't really double-dip, and even then its more of an overlap of topics than an actual DVD re-release.  But look at it this way - many of The Ultimate Warrior's fans have loved this DVD and feel it was an honest and fair portrait of an 80s WWF Superstar.  I was not a fan of The Ultimate Warrior; I don't recommend the documentary.

But he couldn't have been that big of a dirt bag because he was there for a good amount of years numerious times. Which they do elude to. But do you think it has something to do with the Ultimate Warriors Shoot interview and recent rants the Warrior has been going on about the industry. I think so. Its easy to talk about the guy when he isn't on the DVD. But I will say this the best part is the interview segment. THAT is GREAT !! There should have been more interviews instead of matches they were almost more entertaining. I was glad to see the Ravishing One (R.I.P.) Rick Rude received he never received credit.

917403,A1AJEY5DCUW7Z,B000A0D1Q0,UMaine Guy,"[2, 3]","First of the documentary:The documentary is very obvious to anyone watching that it is a smear campaign.  They wanted Jim ""The Warrior"" Helwig to be a part of the disc but when he said ""No way"" they went on a mission to bury him.  The result is entertaining as hell but VEERRRRY laughable.  There is probably about as much truth to this doc as their is B.S.  Some of it is grounded and lots more is pretty unfair.It's easy to crap all over the Warrior when there are all of these crazy videos of him online ranting like a madman.  But the truth is that WWE tried to screw him out of money that he was agreed to...on more than one occasion.The doc mocks his ring entrance, his in-ring work, and his crazy interviews and so forth-- but these are all the same reason that they hired him in the first place!  They were WELL versed in what the Warrior could do.  And they knew they had picked up a great talent because when they gave him a big push he made them (and himself) a lot of money.The Warrior had very minimal technical skills in the ring but his physicality and charisma, both of which were stellar, put him over w/ the fans in a big way.  The smear campaign comes of as a bit tongue-in-cheek, particularly with the wreslter interviews because it's clear that they all idolized him as teens.  I'd give the doc a 4 out of 5 stars simply on entertainment value alone.  Just don't believe everything Vince would like you to.The Matches: There are 3great matches out of the few that are on this.  And if you're lucky enough to on the 2-Disc special edition (available only at FYE stores) then there are FOUR great matches.These are those matches==Steel Cage match for the WWE(WWF) Titlevs. Rick RudeSummerslam '90**** (out of 5)Roddy Piper's utter disdain for the Warrior during his commentary was HILARIOUS!  There was such a real hatred for the guy that he couldn't hide it even though the Warrior was the biggest face draw that year.  The match itself was a very fast-paced brawl for that era ('85sh-'92ish).  Very entertaining if not a bit short.WWE (WWF) Titlevs. Hulk Hogan(c)****It's rumored heavily that these two actually REHEARSED this match (a practice that really hadn't been done since the '70s) in order to make it look good.  This is the first time on t.v. that Hogan missed his leg drop.  This match the best performance any one had seen from either of these guys from a in-ring work perspective up until that point.Career Matchvs. Macho King Randy Savage w/ Queen SherriWrestlemania VII*** 1/2Savage took Warrior to new heights in this match and as a result both came off really well.  The end dragged on a bit and so did the post-match between Savage/Elizabeth but for the time that was considered high drama in the world of pro wrestling *ahem* sports entertainment.Bonus disc highlight:**** 1/2WWE (WWF) Titlevs. Randy Savage (c)The build-up/storyline for this match was probably the best in WWE history up to this point.  And the match didn't disappoint.  These two worked so well together and Savage (one of the most gifted wrestlers of all time) elevated Warrior to a match that we will never see again from these guys unfortunately.  There are so many near falls and every single one is a nail-biter.  The storyline (""Which guy is hired Ric Flair & Mr. Perfect to help them win?"") builds the tension even more.  This is an oft overlooked classic.There are handful of other matches on this DVD but these were really the only ones of note.

It was completely biased and one sided. The best part of it to me was seeing a match between HHH when he first started in the WWF and comparing him to how he looks today. The guy looked like he weighed 200 pounds. Now after a steady diet of WWE he looks like a huge bodybuilder.Anyway, this DVD has some good footage and some of it is funny but back in the day of the Ultimate Warrior there were lots of goofey and cartoonish characters in the WWF. This is something that is not pointed out. From what you see on this DVD Jim Hellwig was a jerk, a liar, a scumbag, and a miserable ungrateful person.

Boy was I wrong. Before I purchased this DVD, I had an idea of what it was going to be about, but the way Warrior is buried here far exceeded my expectations. It is one sided, as you don't get any testimony from the Warrior himself. When the Warrior was last seen in the WWF in 1996, he did leave on such horrible terms, which is one of the reasons why this DVD was made, in a way. I was a fan of the Warrior back in the day. But this DVD kind of surprised me. @ first I wasn't going to purchase it, but I couldn't resist. As for the story here, most of the things I was well aware of, some I wasn't. But it's worth a look in any case. Here's my review of the matches:Ultimate Warrior vs. Terry Gibbs - Wrestling Challenge 10/24/87, DUD (Warrior's WWF debut, nothing much to say here, except that Warrior absolutely crushes the jobber)Ultimate Warrior vs. WWF Intercontinental champion The Honky Tonk Man - Summerslam '88, *1/2 (I normally wouldn't give a match of this length that kind of rating, but let's face it, when Warrior defeated Honky Tonk, it was a great moment)WWF Champion Hulk Hogan vs. WWF Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior -Title-For-Title - Wrestlemania VI, ***1/2 (That rating *may be* a little high for some, but looking @ the structure, the hype, the exection, etc, this was a pretty good match considering the wrestlers involved)WWF Champion The Ultimate Warrior vs. Rick Rude - Steel Cage Match - Summerslam '90, *1/2 (another match where there's nothing to write home about, Warrior creams Rude again)Ultimate Warrior vs. Randy Savage - Loser Must Retire - Wrestlemania VII, ****1/4 (The best match on this DVD and the best match ever for the Warrior)Overall, there could've been a better selection of matches. But when you look @ the title of this DVD, the WWE clearly was not going to go out of there way to make this a grand release.

917408,AS7SARWT3IKLK,B000A0D1Q0,W. Malone,"[5, 6]","I watched this dvd last night and thought I would give it an honest review. First off, I am a bigger fan of Warrior now than I was back them during his wrestling years. Just check out his website and you will see the no bs mind and writtings of the man who has come out on top and really did rise above all the negative things said on the dvd. Was I the only one who noticed on the end credits that the Ultimate Warrior is a trademark of ultimate creations,Inc.? That should tell you something right there that unlike most WWE wrestlers, he is one of the few that owns his name. Smart move by the Warrior.The first part of the dvd actually says some positive things about the Warrior. His energy level,attitude and of course his physique was what made him such a draw to the fans. He charged the ring and got fans into the match from the very beginning. They say he could not do much in the way of wrestling and his skills were limited. All I know is he did his job for the WWF. He got fans fired up and the whole time he was in the ring he stayed charged up. Not boring at all like so many ""skilled"" wrestlers who make you just want the match to end because there is NO excitement, NO energy, NOTHING there!You will hear bad comments from Bobby The brain, Ted Debiase,Ric Flair and many others. I think it is a case of jealousy. Wait until you see the shape of these ""icons"" now.  They look terrible, certainly not someone I would respect an opinion from. Now look at Warrior today,still working out,great shape and could blow all these guys away with his mind and body at the same time. I am sure if they each had their own ""self destruction of..."" dvd out they would find out that THEY are really hated to. The way this dvd is presented, even the music in the background you will notice is all a way for you to look at Warrior in a negative way.And as far as his going to WCW for a short period of time...did you notice he was even more cut up and in better shape than when he was in the WWF? He actually got better as the years went by while the Hogans,Flairs,etc look worse and worse. Just being honest. Ric Flair was one of my favorites at one time and so was Ted Debiase. If anything this dvd showed the self destruction of these guys and I lost all respect for them all at the same time after watching this. All you hear about is about how Warrior was in this for the money. Well, what wrestler isn't in it for the money?Warrior paid his dues and he was worth more than mnay,if not all of the other wrestlers at the time. This is marketing at it's best. I guess Hogan would go back to wrestling for $25.00 a night because he ""loved"" wrestling and only cares for the fans and not the money. I don't think so. As I said Warrior was smart and they don't like the fact that he could stand for himself and realize his worth. They are all in it for the money truth be told. There is nothing wrong with being successful and making more as you advance. He was at the top and the others who where there for years could not stand this.I was going to say don't buy this dvd because of all the negative Warrioe bashing. But really I encourage everyone to buy it and you will hopefully see the ""truth."" If you don't want to lose respect for Flair,Hogan,etc. then don't buy it because if you saw this dvd the way I did then you will lose lots of respect for them. Funny thing is you will probably see Warrior in a better person...moving on, speaking,working out,and being a success AND owning his own name(a fact that WWF cannot stand).This is my opinion and the way I saw it. I just saw so many other reviews and I wanted to show everyone there is another side to the story. Oh yeah, one more thing. As much as Vince/WWF gets mad at not having the rights to all the names in the company guess who else own their own name? Hulk Hogan is a trademark owned by Terry Bollea and is used with permission on this dvd....Talk about a hypocrite...Hogan does the same thing the WWF gets mad at Warrior for!",4,READ BETWEEN THE LIES AND SEE THE TRUTH,1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,3991,"['watched', 'dvd', 'last', 'night', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'honest', 'review', 'First', 'am', 'bigger', 'fan', 'Warrior', 'now', 'was', 'back', 'wrestling', 'years', 'Just', 'check', 'out', 'website', 'will', 'see', 'bs', 'mind', 'writtings', 'man', 'who', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'really', 'did', 'rise', 'negative', 'things', 'said', 'dvd', 'Was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'noticed', 'end', 'Ultimate', 'Warrior', 'trademark', 'ultimate', 'creations', 'Inc.', 'should', 'tell', 'something', 'right', 'most', 'WWE', 'wrestlers', 'one', 'few', 'name', 'Smart', 'move', 'Warrior.The', 'first', 'part', 'dvd', 'actually', 'positive', 'things', 'Warrior', 'energy', 'level', 'attitude', 'course', 'physique', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'draw', 'fans', 'charged', 'ring', 'got', 'fans', 'match', 'very', 'beginning', 'say', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'much', 'way', 'wrestling', 'skills', 'were', 'limited', 'know', 'did', 'job', 'WWF', 'got', 'fans', 'fired', 'up', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'ring', 'stayed', 'charged', 'up', 'Not', 'boring', 'so', 'many', 'skilled', 'wrestlers', 'who', 'make', 'just', 'want', 'match', 'end', 'excitement', 'NO', 'energy', 'NOTHING', 'there', 'will', 'hear', 'bad', 'comments', 'Bobby', 'brain', 'Ted', 'Debiase', 'Ric', 'Flair', 'many', 'others', 'think', 'case', 'jealousy', 'Wait', 'see', 'shape', 'icons', 'now', 'look', 'terrible', 'certainly', 'not', 'someone', 'would', 'respect', 'opinion', 'Now', 'look', 'Warrior', 'today', 'still', 'working', 'out', 'great', 'shape', 'could', 'blow', 'guys', 'away', 'mind', 'body', 'same', 'time', 'am', 'sure', 'had', 'own', 'self', 'destruction', 'out', 'would', 'find', 'out', 'THEY', 'are', 'really', 'hated', 'way', 'dvd', 'presented', 'even', 'music', 'background', 'will', 'notice', 'way', 'look', 'Warrior', 'negative', 'way.And', 'as', 'far', 'going', 'WCW', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'did', 'notice', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'cut', 'up', 'better', 'shape', 'when', 'was', 'WWF', 'actually', 'got', 'better', 'years', 'went', 'Hogans', 'Flairs', 'etc', 'look', 'worse', 'worse', 'Just', 'being', 'honest', 'Ric', 'Flair', 'was', 'one', 'favorites', 'one', 'time', 'so', 'was', 'Ted', 'Debiase', 'anything', 'dvd', 'showed', 'self', 'destruction', 'guys', 'lost', 'respect', 'same', 'time', 'watching', 'hear', 'how', 'Warrior', 'was', 'money', 'Well', 'what', 'wrestler', ""n't"", 'money', 'Warrior', 'paid', 'dues', 'was', 'worth', 'more', 'mnay', 'not', 'other', 'wrestlers', 'time', 'marketing', 'best', 'guess', 'Hogan', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'wrestling', '25.00', 'night', 'loved', 'wrestling', 'only', 'cares', 'fans', 'not', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'said', 'Warrior', 'was', 'smart', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'could', 'stand', 'realize', 'worth', 'are', 'money', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'being', 'successful', 'making', 'more', 'advance', 'was', 'top', 'others', 'who', 'where', 'there', 'years', 'could', 'not', 'stand', 'this.I', 'was', 'going', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'dvd', 'negative', 'Warrioe', 'bashing', 'really', 'encourage', 'everyone', 'buy', 'will', 'hopefully', 'see', 'truth', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'lose', 'respect', 'Flair', 'Hogan', 'etc', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'saw', 'way', 'did', 'then', 'will', 'lose', 'lots', 'respect', 'Funny', 'thing', 'will', 'probably', 'see', 'Warrior', 'better', 'person', 'moving', 'speaking', 'working', 'out', 'being', 'success', 'owning', 'own', 'name', 'fact', 'WWF', 'can', 'not', 'stand', '.This', 'opinion', 'way', 'saw', 'just', 'saw', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'wanted', 'show', 'everyone', 'side', 'story', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'As', 'much', 'Vince/WWF', 'mad', 'not', 'having', 'rights', 'names', 'company', 'guess', 'who', 'else', 'own', 'own', 'name', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'trademark', 'owned', 'Terry', 'Bollea', 'used', 'permission', 'dvd', '.Talk', 'hypocrite', 'Hogan', 'same', 'thing', 'WWF', 'mad', 'Warrior']",The Self Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior
