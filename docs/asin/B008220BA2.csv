1542054,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B008220BA2,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[0, 1]","Ruby Sparks has some good moments and some not so good moments. The first half of this romantic drama is quite strong but halfway through, the film loses it's quirky magic and steam once we are introduced to Calvin's mother (Annette Bening) and her eccentric lover played by Antonio Banderas. But after that whole wacky and unnecessary scene, the movie comes to life again once we get to see the odd relationship between Calvin, and his dream girl Ruby come undone at the seams. This film was written by Zoe Kazan who also stars in the title role. Her real life boyfriend, Paul Dano plays Calvin...a young writer who is struggling with writer's block. Ruby Sparks is not real so to speak, Calvin has dreams about Ruby and he writes about her and she starts appearing in his every day life. Zoe Kazan is a talented actress, just watch the scene where she has a meltdown when Calvin lets go of her hand while he answers his cell phone, Zoe is not only funny but has amazing emotional depth. For a first time screenwriter, I felt Kazan wrote an honest and yet slightly disorganized film. I think there's too many background characters like Calvin's brother and his mother that cause the film to drag and lose focus. But I also think the last 30 minutes of Ruby Sparks is incredibly strong and the ending is sweet and very satisfying. Ruby Spaks isn't a perfect film but it's definitely an interesting, creative one!

I imagine she may have felt she could pull it off if she starred in the role, but the role is undercut by the reality and as the character is the center of the film, the whole thing is stopped by her being unreal.  As a book and film lover, the movie really doesn't have much to say about the muse, or the reality of the mind, despite it being about both.  Sometimes, planning and brilliance can make these problems go away and/or make less noticeable and you can enjoy the movie more, but even two directors couldn't get this material right.  Maybe the material is wrong, it's the idea that makes people think it has merit.  Either way, the whole thing feels like a sham despite a lot of talent holding up their end of the bargain, technically and performance-wise.

Then, upon his therapist's request, he simply starts writing about whatever he likes and soon starts writing of the woman of his literal dreams. And, one day, she's alive ... in his house ... in his life. Calvin soon discovers that his new girlfriend, Ruby (Kazan), can and will do anything he writes of her to do. What starts off as somewhat of a romantic comedy-type of film soon turns into a serious study about the horrors that can become of having control over someone you truly love ... and of how free will is a beautiful thing. Dano and Kazan have great chemistry together -- maybe that's because they are a couple in real life! And the writing is what impressed me the most!

1542062,A2582KMXLK2P06,B008220BA2,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","Ruby Sparks sure is an odd -but entertaining- film.  It's about a struggling young novel writter played by Paul Dano that not only has trouble with his writing and experiences a case of writers block, but since he's secluded and spends quite a bit of his time in his dark house, he also has the all too realistic problem concerning having relationships with women so... he eventually comes up with this idea to create a fictional woman (played by the hot Zoe Kazan, who resembles the new Wendy's girl don't you think?) on his typewriter and discovers -as much as he doesn't want to believe it- that the girl he's been writing about has somehow jumped out of his typewriter and into his world!  Even more crazy, with his typewriter, Paul Dano's character has the ability to change the girl in any way he desires.  All he has to do is type it, and it happens.  Zoe's basically under his command at all times.Definitely a creative storyline but will it satisfy viewers?  Probably.  Might have to hang with it though, since some parts drag.For quite a bit of time, the storyline focuses on a slower-moving romantic theme that viewers might find somewhat uninteresting.  The first half of the movie for example, isn't very appealing from a storyline point of view.  This is when Paul's character is so amazed that this fictional girl is actually part of reality he doesn't really know how to cope with it.  Later on when Paul literally changes the girl on his magic typewriter so she goes through a series of crazy mixed feelings, this is an enticing -but definitely very silly- piece of writing.  He's frantically typing on his typewriter and therefore changing the girls emotions, decisions and personality in a matter of seconds.  It's unbelievably silly trust me, haha.  Then again it *is* by definition a fantasy romance.  I think the movie writers could have spaced this aspect out in a more interesting way.  Then again Zoe's many layers of drastically different expressions and emotions while this is occurring are pretty good.I'm also quite fond of the scene where Paul Dano meets up with a separate woman and suddenly his fictional girlfriend appears, and presents herself as a normal girl part of society.  This is early on when he still isn't sure whether she's real or not.  The girl he's meeting with becomes quite confused and eventually leaves, lol.  Paul Dano is the perfect man for such a role too since he's very good at the shy and easily intimidated character.Overall, appealing but expect several moments of dry storytelling in the first half (such as the dinner meeting with Paul's family- an overlong and uninteresting part of the film) that aren't particularly great.",4,introducting your imaginary girlfriend,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,2687,"['Ruby', 'Sparks', 'sure', 'odd', '-but', 'entertaining-', 'film', 'struggling', 'young', 'novel', 'writter', 'played', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'not', 'only', 'trouble', 'writing', 'case', 'writers', 'block', 'secluded', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'dark', 'house', 'also', 'too', 'realistic', 'problem', 'concerning', 'having', 'relationships', 'women', 'so', 'eventually', 'up', 'idea', 'create', 'fictional', 'woman', 'played', 'hot', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'who', 'new', 'Wendy', 'girl', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'typewriter', 'discovers', '-as', 'much', ""n't"", 'want', 'believe', 'it-', 'girl', 'been', 'writing', 'about', 'somehow', 'jumped', 'typewriter', 'world', 'Even', 'more', 'crazy', 'typewriter', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'character', 'ability', 'change', 'girl', 'way', 'do', 'type', 'Zoe', 'basically', 'command', 'times.Definitely', 'creative', 'storyline', 'will', 'satisfy', 'viewers', 'Probably', 'Might', 'have', 'hang', 'parts', 'drag.For', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'storyline', 'slower-moving', 'romantic', 'theme', 'viewers', 'might', 'find', 'somewhat', 'uninteresting', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'example', ""n't"", 'very', 'appealing', 'storyline', 'point', 'view', 'when', 'Paul', 'character', 'so', 'amazed', 'fictional', 'girl', 'actually', 'part', 'reality', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'how', 'cope', 'Later', 'when', 'Paul', 'literally', 'girl', 'magic', 'typewriter', 'series', 'crazy', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'enticing', '-but', 'definitely', 'very', 'silly-', 'piece', 'writing', 'frantically', 'typing', 'typewriter', 'therefore', 'changing', 'girls', 'emotions', 'decisions', 'personality', 'matter', 'seconds', 'unbelievably', 'silly', 'trust', 'haha', 'Then', 'again', '*is*', 'definition', 'fantasy', 'romance', 'think', 'movie', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'spaced', 'aspect', 'out', 'more', 'interesting', 'way', 'Then', 'again', 'Zoe', 'many', 'layers', 'drastically', 'different', 'expressions', 'emotions', 'occurring', 'are', 'pretty', 'good.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'quite', 'fond', 'scene', 'where', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'up', 'separate', 'woman', 'suddenly', 'fictional', 'girlfriend', 'presents', 'normal', 'girl', 'part', 'society', 'early', 'when', 'still', ""n't"", 'sure', 'real', 'not', 'girl', 'meeting', 'becomes', 'quite', 'confused', 'eventually', 'lol', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'perfect', 'man', 'such', 'role', 'too', 'very', 'good', 'shy', 'easily', 'intimidated', 'character.Overall', 'appealing', 'expect', 'several', 'moments', 'dry', 'storytelling', 'first', 'half', 'such', 'dinner', 'meeting', 'Paul', 'family-', 'overlong', 'uninteresting', 'part', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'great']",N/A

1542066,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B008220BA2,CriticNic,"[0, 1]","The ills of being a loner are usually most felt when one is single. For Calvin Weir-Fields (Paul Dano), this is the case. Calvin is an emerging novelist battling a bad case of writer's block. He also longs for the girl of his dreams. After his therapist suggests he write about his dreams, he winds up describing that girl of his dreams. At first, Calvin thinks he's come up with the perfect romance novel. However, he never dreamed that she would come alive from his pages and spontaneously into his life.Ruby Sparks (played by the film's writer, Zoe Kazan) is suddenly Calvin's girlfriend, and he couldn't be happier. He easily forgets about his writing, after all he's got the perfect girl. The reality of the relationship suddenly takes hold, and the standoffish Calvin finds himself in a serious dilemma: does he continue to write Ruby's life to satisfy himself, or does he let it run its course?The idea of manifesting one's desires simply by writing about them is an ability I'm sure many of us could be tempted to utilize. For Calvin, it's a miracle. Is he crazy? Does Ruby really exist? These questions and perhaps many more will come into your head, but to be honest worrying about the answers to those questions would be less time spent on appreciating the heart of the movie. The film really has a lot to offer in terms of morality, relationships, and family on top of being an excellent character study.Dano is a natural playing the quirky, standoffish writing prodigy. He makes us care for the character, and really brings him to life. Equally ""real"" and impressive is Zoe Kazan as the cute and charming Ruby. The pair have excellent chemistry on camera, which would make sense as the two have been dating for years in real life. While the film is certainly a quirky romantic comedy, some of the exchanges with Ruby and Calvin are quite dramatic, as are many of the dealings with Calvin's psychological issues and his family. The film's ability to combine the fun romance with some very seriously toned human elements is really what made it feel special to me.I could relate to some aspects of Calvin's character (not the whole brilliant writer part, sadly). But as I mention in many of my reviews of films with more eccentric leads, they just offer more of a real slice of life that reaches me at a more emotional level. This film had a really promising creative plot with a likable main character, which alone would make it hard to not be entertaining barring a terrible execution. But the film goes beyond the laughs and really touches on real feelings and situations. In other words, it takes plot about personal relationships and puts a spin on it to make it both intriguing, emotional and funny at the same time.It would be easy for a film like this to come off as being too ""hip"" or as trying too hard to be different. But Ruby Sparks really avoids becoming a gimmick with its honesty. The characters have such depth and the story is so relevant that the more fantasy aspects of the film subtly occur while not taking away from the focus on the characters. Ruby Sparks had my interest from the get-go, but I didn't expect it to be as much of a delight as it was. A fine example of a cool concept beautifully executed.Source: criticnic.com 11 December 2012Disclosure: Film sent by 20th Century Fox",5,Clever and entertaining,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,3317,"['ills', 'being', 'loner', 'are', 'usually', 'most', 'felt', 'when', 'one', 'single', 'Calvin', 'Weir-Fields', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'case', 'Calvin', 'emerging', 'novelist', 'battling', 'bad', 'case', 'writer', 'block', 'also', 'girl', 'dreams', 'therapist', 'write', 'dreams', 'up', 'describing', 'girl', 'dreams', 'first', 'Calvin', 'come', 'up', 'perfect', 'romance', 'novel', 'However', 'never', 'dreamed', 'would', 'come', 'alive', 'pages', 'spontaneously', 'life.Ruby', 'Sparks', 'played', 'film', 'writer', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'suddenly', 'Calvin', 'girlfriend', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier', 'easily', 'writing', 'got', 'perfect', 'girl', 'reality', 'relationship', 'suddenly', 'hold', 'standoffish', 'Calvin', 'serious', 'dilemma', 'continue', 'write', 'Ruby', 'life', 'satisfy', 'let', 'run', 'course', 'idea', 'manifesting', 'one', 'desires', 'simply', 'writing', 'ability', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'could', 'be', 'tempted', 'utilize', 'Calvin', 'miracle', 'crazy', 'Does', 'Ruby', 'really', 'exist', 'questions', 'perhaps', 'many', 'more', 'will', 'come', 'head', 'be', 'honest', 'worrying', 'answers', 'questions', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'time', 'spent', 'appreciating', 'heart', 'movie', 'film', 'really', 'lot', 'offer', 'terms', 'morality', 'relationships', 'family', 'top', 'being', 'excellent', 'character', 'study.Dano', 'natural', 'playing', 'quirky', 'standoffish', 'writing', 'prodigy', 'care', 'character', 'really', 'life', 'Equally', 'real', 'impressive', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'cute', 'charming', 'Ruby', 'pair', 'have', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'camera', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'dating', 'years', 'real', 'life', 'film', 'certainly', 'quirky', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'exchanges', 'Ruby', 'Calvin', 'are', 'quite', 'dramatic', 'are', 'many', 'dealings', 'Calvin', 'psychological', 'issues', 'family', 'film', 'ability', 'combine', 'fun', 'romance', 'very', 'seriously', 'toned', 'human', 'elements', 'really', 'what', 'made', 'feel', 'special', 'me.I', 'could', 'relate', 'aspects', 'Calvin', 'character', 'not', 'whole', 'brilliant', 'writer', 'part', 'sadly', 'mention', 'many', 'reviews', 'films', 'more', 'eccentric', 'leads', 'just', 'offer', 'more', 'real', 'slice', 'life', 'more', 'emotional', 'level', 'film', 'had', 'really', 'promising', 'creative', 'plot', 'likable', 'main', 'character', 'alone', 'would', 'make', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'entertaining', 'barring', 'terrible', 'execution', 'film', 'laughs', 'really', 'touches', 'real', 'feelings', 'situations', 'other', 'words', 'plot', 'personal', 'relationships', 'spin', 'make', 'intriguing', 'emotional', 'funny', 'same', 'time.It', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'film', 'come', 'off', 'being', 'too', 'hip', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'different', 'Ruby', 'Sparks', 'really', 'becoming', 'gimmick', 'honesty', 'characters', 'have', 'such', 'depth', 'story', 'so', 'relevant', 'more', 'fantasy', 'aspects', 'film', 'subtly', 'occur', 'not', 'taking', 'away', 'focus', 'characters', 'Ruby', 'Sparks', 'had', 'interest', 'get-go', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'delight', 'was', 'fine', 'example', 'cool', 'concept', 'beautifully', 'criticnic.com', '11', 'December', '2012Disclosure', 'Film', 'sent', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox']",N/A
1542067,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B008220BA2,C. Sawin,"[21, 23]","Speaking as somebody who writes short stories as a hobby in addition to film reviews; ""Ruby Sparks"" is pretty spectacular. Just the idea of one of your stories becoming a reality is basically every author's dream. Unless you're a horror writer, then you might hope it never leaves the page. Thinking about that somehow happening is inspiring in itself though. If that was a guideline, to only write stories you think deserve to exist in the real world, then we'd have a very different literary back catalog.Paul Dano brings yet another extremely relatable character to the screen. His ongoing struggle to come up with a good story really hits home hard as does his issues with women. Falling in love with your own creation seems a lot more reasonable than attempting to swim in the dating world. Dano's performance is gut-wrenching at times because you know where at least part of this story is going and it's not going to end well; an emotional breakdown is inevitable. Dano is also just as engrossing as ever while making simple emotions of depression, inspiration, love, and heartache seem like a grand spectacle.Zoe Kazan is really superb, as well. Attempting to be the embodiment of somebody's dream girl probably isn't the easiest job, but Kazan seems to do it with ease. Her performance is at its best when Calvin realizes that whatever he writes about Ruby on his typewriter comes to life. Those moments are when the humor of the film is at its peak and when the sadder moments punch you in your chest a little bit harder. It probably helps that Dano and Kazan are a couple off-screen, but their chemistry and an incredibly well-written screenplay are what make the film as strong as it is.For most, ""Ruby Sparks"" will probably just seem like this slightly better than average romantic comedy and that's fair; no one will fault you for that. But if you are a writer, if you have ever written a story for fun, have done that more than once, and/or have ever been compensated for this written work then ""Ruby Sparks"" will speak to you the way that it should.While it isn't nearly as good, ""Ruby Sparks"" does slightly resemble ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" at times. With excellent and engaging performances from Paul Dano and Zoe Kazan, fantastic writing, and the ability to breathe a lot of life into a concept that may have been really absurd under different circumstances, ""Ruby Sparks"" is extraordinarily charming and should not be missed.",4,Delightfully enchanting,1343952000,"08 3, 2012",2012,2459,"['Speaking', 'somebody', 'who', 'short', 'stories', 'hobby', 'addition', 'film', 'reviews', 'Ruby', 'Sparks', 'pretty', 'spectacular', 'Just', 'idea', 'one', 'stories', 'becoming', 'reality', 'basically', 'author', 'dream', ""'re"", 'horror', 'writer', 'then', 'might', 'hope', 'never', 'page', 'Thinking', 'somehow', 'happening', 'inspiring', 'was', 'guideline', 'only', 'write', 'stories', 'think', 'deserve', 'exist', 'real', 'world', 'then', ""'d"", 'have', 'very', 'different', 'literary', 'back', 'catalog.Paul', 'Dano', 'yet', 'extremely', 'relatable', 'character', 'screen', 'ongoing', 'struggle', 'come', 'up', 'good', 'story', 'really', 'home', 'hard', 'issues', 'women', 'Falling', 'love', 'own', 'creation', 'lot', 'more', 'reasonable', 'attempting', 'swim', 'dating', 'world', 'Dano', 'performance', 'gut-wrenching', 'times', 'know', 'where', 'least', 'part', 'story', 'going', 'not', 'going', 'end', 'well', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'inevitable', 'Dano', 'also', 'just', 'as', 'engrossing', 'ever', 'making', 'simple', 'emotions', 'depression', 'inspiration', 'love', 'heartache', 'seem', 'grand', 'spectacle.Zoe', 'Kazan', 'really', 'superb', 'as', 'well', 'Attempting', 'be', 'embodiment', 'somebody', 'dream', 'girl', 'probably', ""n't"", 'easiest', 'job', 'Kazan', 'do', 'ease', 'performance', 'best', 'when', 'Calvin', 'Ruby', 'typewriter', 'life', 'moments', 'are', 'when', 'humor', 'film', 'peak', 'when', 'sadder', 'moments', 'punch', 'chest', 'little', 'bit', 'harder', 'probably', 'Dano', 'Kazan', 'are', 'couple', 'off-screen', 'chemistry', 'incredibly', 'well-written', 'screenplay', 'are', 'make', 'film', 'as', 'strong', 'most', 'Ruby', 'Sparks', 'will', 'probably', 'just', 'seem', 'slightly', 'better', 'average', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'fair', 'one', 'will', 'fault', 'are', 'writer', 'have', 'ever', 'written', 'story', 'fun', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'once', 'and/or', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'compensated', 'written', 'work', 'then', 'Ruby', 'Sparks', 'will', 'speak', 'way', 'should.While', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'Ruby', 'Sparks', 'slightly', 'resemble', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'times', 'excellent', 'engaging', 'performances', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'fantastic', 'writing', 'ability', 'breathe', 'lot', 'life', 'concept', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'absurd', 'different', 'circumstances', 'Ruby', 'Sparks', 'extraordinarily', 'charming', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

1542073,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B008220BA2,Ed Uyeshima,"[7, 10]","This engaging 21st century take on the ""Pygmalion"" myth provides a welcome return for husband-and-wife filmmakers Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (Little Miss Sunshine) who bring their unique fluency in capturing human dynamics to this 2012 romantic comedy. Rather than showing the ramshackle misadventures of a fractious family as they did with their first film written by Michael Arndt, the story this time is far more internal and introspective as it concerns a young novelist with a severe case of writer's block and how his mercurial imagination intersects with his otherwise taciturn life. The screenplay is a prodigious first effort by actress Zoe Kazan (film legend Elia's granddaughter) who also plays the title role. She does an impressive job in capturing the exhilaration of fulfilling one man's dream girl illusion but appears less assured in showing the downside. In fact, the familiarity of the story elements and the continually insular nature of the narrative eventually work against the whimsical tone the filmmakers are trying to achieve. That's not to say the film is without its pleasures of which there are many, it's just that the film falls short in exhibiting the audacity and insight of the be-careful-what-you-wish-for theme it sets out to explore.The young novelist in question is Calvin Weir-Fields, whose first novel a decade prior is spoken by the literati in the same reverential tone as J.D. Salinger'sThe Catcher in the Rye. He's anxiously trying to start his second novel within the confines of his pristine white LA home, but he can't seem to get inspired until he starts dreaming about a girl who becomes his fictional romantic ideal. Encouraged by his avuncular therapist Dr. Rosenthal, he begins writing about her on his vintage Olympia typewriter and conceives an unconventional, guileless artist named Ruby Sparks. When Ruby unexpectedly comes to life in his home, Calvin initially thinks he is hallucinating, but when he realizes other people can see her, he faces a series of challenges that peel away his preconceived notions about control and love and concurrently expose his unacknowledged narcissism. What Kazan does well as both actress and writer is not make Ruby a pliable automaton catering to Calvin's every desire but rather an eccentric, increasingly emancipated free spirit who gradually forges her own identity much to Calvin's consternation. The premise, however, starts to feel especially thin when the pair visit Calvin's hippie mother Gertrude and her furniture-building partner Mort in Big Sur when new story elements are introduced and then discarded.Reminding me of other movies that twisted fantasy with reality in surprisingly resonant ways, in particular, Marc Forster'sStranger Than Fictionand Michel Gondry'sEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, this film does not feel like Dayton and Faris push the envelope far enough, eventually indulging in the sort of wish fulfillment that the story initially appeared to be deconstructing. Regardless, the filmmakers have assembled an excellent cast. Paul Dano, who played the sullen, silent older brother in ""Sunshine"", plays Calvin with a nicely deft touch without sacrificing the intense vulnerability and angst for which the actor is known. Kazan is an ebullient joy as Ruby, even though Zooey Deschanel ((500) Days Of Summer) has already cornered the market on this type of role. As Calvin's no-nonsense brother Harry, Chris Messina does an effective job as the cynical voice of reason. While it's nice to see Annette Bening and Antonio Banderas gamely cast in atypical roles as Gertrude and Mort, their screen time is limited and their characters rather inconsequential. It's also good to see Elliot Gould play it straight for a change as Rosenthal. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique (Black Swan) and production designer Judy Becker (Brokeback Mountain) do expert work in capturing Calvin's hermetically sealed world.",3,Exuberant Dream Girl Fantasy Starts Well But Could Show More Audacity by the End,1344297600,"08 7, 2012",2012,3935,"['engaging', '21st', 'century', 'take', 'Pygmalion', 'myth', 'welcome', 'return', 'husband-and-wife', 'filmmakers', 'Jonathan', 'Dayton', 'Valerie', 'Faris', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'who', 'bring', 'unique', 'fluency', 'capturing', 'human', 'dynamics', '2012', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Rather', 'showing', 'ramshackle', 'misadventures', 'fractious', 'family', 'did', 'first', 'film', 'written', 'Michael', 'Arndt', 'story', 'time', 'far', 'more', 'internal', 'introspective', 'young', 'novelist', 'severe', 'case', 'writer', 'block', 'how', 'mercurial', 'imagination', 'intersects', 'otherwise', 'taciturn', 'life', 'screenplay', 'prodigious', 'first', 'effort', 'actress', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'film', 'legend', 'Elia', 'granddaughter', 'who', 'also', 'title', 'role', 'impressive', 'job', 'capturing', 'exhilaration', 'fulfilling', 'one', 'man', 'dream', 'girl', 'illusion', 'less', 'assured', 'showing', 'downside', 'fact', 'familiarity', 'story', 'elements', 'continually', 'insular', 'nature', 'narrative', 'eventually', 'work', 'whimsical', 'tone', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'trying', 'achieve', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'pleasures', 'are', 'many', 'just', 'film', 'short', 'exhibiting', 'audacity', 'insight', 'be-careful-what-you-wish-for', 'theme', 'out', 'explore.The', 'young', 'novelist', 'question', 'Calvin', 'Weir-Fields', 'first', 'novel', 'decade', 'prior', 'spoken', 'literati', 'same', 'reverential', 'tone', 'J.D', ""Salinger'sThe"", 'Catcher', 'Rye', 'anxiously', 'trying', 'start', 'second', 'novel', 'confines', 'pristine', 'white', 'LA', 'home', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'inspired', 'dreaming', 'girl', 'who', 'fictional', 'romantic', 'ideal', 'Encouraged', 'avuncular', 'therapist', 'Dr.', 'Rosenthal', 'writing', 'vintage', 'Olympia', 'typewriter', 'unconventional', 'guileless', 'artist', 'named', 'Ruby', 'Sparks', 'When', 'Ruby', 'unexpectedly', 'life', 'home', 'Calvin', 'initially', 'hallucinating', 'when', 'other', 'people', 'can', 'see', 'series', 'challenges', 'peel', 'away', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'control', 'love', 'concurrently', 'expose', 'unacknowledged', 'narcissism', 'What', 'Kazan', 'well', 'actress', 'writer', 'not', 'make', 'Ruby', 'pliable', 'automaton', 'catering', 'Calvin', 'desire', 'rather', 'eccentric', 'increasingly', 'emancipated', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'gradually', 'own', 'identity', 'much', 'Calvin', 'consternation', 'premise', 'however', 'feel', 'especially', 'thin', 'when', 'pair', 'visit', 'Calvin', 'hippie', 'mother', 'Gertrude', 'furniture-building', 'partner', 'Mort', 'Big', 'Sur', 'when', 'new', 'story', 'elements', 'are', 'introduced', 'then', 'discarded.Reminding', 'other', 'movies', 'twisted', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'surprisingly', 'resonant', 'ways', 'particular', 'Marc', ""Forster'sStranger"", 'Than', 'Fictionand', 'Michel', ""Gondry'sEternal"", 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'film', 'not', 'feel', 'Dayton', 'Faris', 'push', 'envelope', 'far', 'enough', 'eventually', 'indulging', 'sort', 'wish', 'fulfillment', 'story', 'initially', 'appeared', 'be', 'deconstructing', 'Regardless', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'assembled', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'who', 'played', 'sullen', 'silent', 'older', 'brother', 'Sunshine', 'Calvin', 'nicely', 'deft', 'touch', 'sacrificing', 'intense', 'vulnerability', 'angst', 'actor', 'known', 'Kazan', 'ebullient', 'joy', 'Ruby', 'even', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'already', 'cornered', 'market', 'type', 'role', 'Calvin', 'no-nonsense', 'brother', 'Harry', 'Chris', 'Messina', 'effective', 'job', 'cynical', 'voice', 'reason', 'nice', 'see', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'gamely', 'cast', 'atypical', 'roles', 'Gertrude', 'Mort', 'screen', 'time', 'limited', 'characters', 'rather', 'inconsequential', 'also', 'good', 'see', 'Elliot', 'Gould', 'play', 'straight', 'change', 'Rosenthal', 'Cinematographer', 'Matthew', 'Libatique', 'Black', 'Swan', 'production', 'designer', 'Judy', 'Becker', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'do', 'expert', 'work', 'capturing', 'Calvin', 'hermetically', 'sealed', 'world']",N/A

It is entirely possible that screenwriter Zoe Kazan thought she was inspired by a dream or something, but about seven or eight years ago, I saw ""The Love List,"" a delightful play by Canadian Norm Foster which it unmistakably echoes. In fact, I could giggle in anticipation of certain twists and turns.That being said, this charming comedy/fantasy/romance is well acted and nicely photographed. It is thought provoking (what would you get if you could create the lover of your dreams?), funny (be careful what you wish for) and satisfying (happy endings, anyone?).We see:* Paul Dano (""There Will Be Blood"") as Calvin, a writer who is single, lonely and very creative.* Zoe Kazan (""It's Complicated"") as Ruby, the girl of his dreams...literally!* Chris Messina (""Argo"") is Calvin's skeptical brother Harry, who would like to see more ""physical"" attributes rather than intellectual for his brother's dream girl.* Annette Bening (""The Kids Are All Right"") is the boys' Earth Mother, anxious to see BOTH sons settled down and happy.* Antonio Banderas (""Haywire'') is Mom's lusty new husband. He makes stuff.* Steve Coogan (""Our Idiot Brother"") is our hero's publisher. This actor always plays the same person...* Elliott Gould (the ""Ocean's"" franchise) is unrecognizable as our hero's therapist; I was surprised to see his name.The quality of the acting is always notable when Paul Dano is involved and I was impressed by the multi-talented Zoe Kazan (writer AND actress) who is also his significant other in real life. Another real-life couple, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (""Little Miss Sunshine"") are the directors.

1542082,A2BAAKZHSUGCDP,B008220BA2,"Jill Clardy ""So many books, so little time....""","[2, 2]","Nerdy, lonely Calvin is considered a genius writer, though he has struggled to produce much since his breakout novel in his teens nearly 10 years ago. He lives in a large sparsely decorated all-white house, and has no friends other than his brother who urges him to get out more. He writes on his old manual typewriter, but is totally blocked until he starts to dream about a girl who inhabits his nights and gives him something to write about. One day, he discovers that she is real and is living with him. He has created the perfect girl, Ruby Sparks, out of his own mind and can't believe his luck. He soon discovers that whatever he writes determines her actions, and it is a heady power that he is afraid to wield, so he puts the book away and vies to write no more about her.When their relationship starts to fray a bit, he is gives into the temptation to unlock the book and write a different scene for Ruby. His power to manipulate her and meld her into what he wants her to be is disturbing, and leads to the explosive, climactic scene in the movie, which I won't spoil.Zoe Kazan, as Ruby, is delightful and quirky, fun-loving and cute. It is difficult to imagine an actress who could have played this part better. Calvin is serious and emotive, but somewhat annoying. The premise of being able to mold and alter someone else's personality to suit your own whim is interesting and daunting and certainly thought provoking. Though the movie was described as &#34;rom com&#34;, that seems a shallow categorization. There is some comedy, and there is romance, but it is more of an intellectual drama than the romcom genre conveys.",4,Quirky and Provocative,1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,1636,"['Nerdy', 'lonely', 'Calvin', 'considered', 'genius', 'writer', 'struggled', 'produce', 'much', 'breakout', 'novel', 'teens', 'nearly', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'large', 'sparsely', 'decorated', 'all-white', 'house', 'friends', 'other', 'brother', 'who', 'get', 'out', 'more', 'old', 'manual', 'typewriter', 'totally', 'blocked', 'dream', 'girl', 'who', 'nights', 'something', 'write', 'about', 'One', 'day', 'real', 'living', 'created', 'perfect', 'girl', 'Ruby', 'Sparks', 'own', 'mind', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'luck', 'soon', 'actions', 'heady', 'power', 'afraid', 'wield', 'book', 'away', 'vies', 'write', 'more', 'relationship', 'fray', 'bit', 'temptation', 'unlock', 'book', 'write', 'different', 'scene', 'Ruby', 'power', 'manipulate', 'meld', 'what', 'be', 'disturbing', 'explosive', 'climactic', 'scene', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil.Zoe', 'Kazan', 'Ruby', 'delightful', 'quirky', 'fun-loving', 'cute', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'actress', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'part', 'better', 'Calvin', 'serious', 'emotive', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'premise', 'being', 'able', 'mold', 'alter', 'someone', 'else', 'personality', 'suit', 'own', 'whim', 'interesting', 'daunting', 'certainly', 'thought', 'provoking', 'movie', 'was', 'described', '34', 'rom', 'com', '34', 'shallow', 'categorization', 'comedy', 'romance', 'more', 'intellectual', 'drama', 'romcom', 'genre', 'conveys']",N/A

It stars Paul Dano and his off-screen girlfriend (I think) Zoe Kazan (also written by Zoe). And I was surprised to see Annette Bening and Antonio Banderas playing Paul's character parents.About a writer, Calvin played by Paul Dano, with a outstanding book written 10 years ago. And hasn't written anything good since. When his book producer introduces him at a book forum, Langdon tells everyone about Calvin's great book and other mediocre short works. Langdon then says that it wasn't until he reread the 10th anniversary of Calvin's great work that he didn't really know how good a writer Calvin was.  I really felt sorry for Calvin when he was described like that by his producer.His shrink, played by Elliot Gould, tells Calvin to write something about his dog that pees like a girl.  I liked how Elliot's character told Calvin that he'd love the story to be badly written. From there, Calvin writes about his dream girl, Ruby Sparks, who then becomes real. Kind of like Weird Science. Calvin has created her and can make her do and be whatever he wants.  I liked their romantic relationship.  I felt that it was quite genuine and realistic.I love this movie because it is has a very good character driven. Paul Dano's character was pretty good. I felt really sorry for the guy. And really happy that he was writing again and found his dream girl. If and how Calvin keeps the girl, I won't say because that's a big spoiler. But I will let you know that this does have a happy ending. One that I smile and even lightly laugh at.I liked this movie - and I'm not much of a writer. This movie spoke to me because I think it embodies what relationships are. Complex. At one point, Calvin writes that ""Ruby is just Ruby.

Paul Dano is Calvin who had a wildly successful book before getting out of high school.  And not much since.  The nagging writer's block is hampering Cal who still pounds out material on an old Corona manual typewriter.  Sure.Cal has a book due and he can't get going.  He has a shrink (Elliott Gould) and a not too helpful brother (Chris Messina) who want to help but...

He comes home one day and finds, Ruby Sparks has come to life and is in fact, living in his house.Ruby is played by Zoe Kazan (granddaughter of famed director Elia Kazan) who also contributed the screenplay.  She's excellent, having to play a wide range of emotions as Cal begins to modify his description of her when she starts to behave like a real person would.  Does Cal want the woman he originally fell in love with or someone molded in his own image?The supporting cast is excellent as well with Annette Bening and Antonio Banderas as the sibling's hippy-like mother and step-father.

1542098,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B008220BA2,Paul Allaer,"[33, 39]","In ""Ruby Sparks"" (104 min.), Calvin (played by Paul Dano) plays a writer who found great acclaim as a late teenager but now 10 years later is lonely and struggling with writer's block. In his dreams he meets the perfect girl whom he calls Ruby (played by Zoe Kazan), he starts writing about it, and then one morning Calvim wakes up only to find Ruby in his kitchen, fixing breakfast. It's a miracle, right? Is it the magic in the typewriter (Calvin types ""Ruby speaks French"" and a moment later she speaks French)? No explanation is given. However now that Ruby is alive and well, she does not always act EXACTLY like Calvin wants her to, and the temptation to run to the typewriter and fix every signle problem is great, but what would that do to their relationship in the long run? To give away more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: the movie is intended as a romcom, and there are indeed many fine moments that made me smile. But the movie also examines some profounder issues that go to the very nature of the human race: free will (with the potential for making mistakes or worse) or no free will (at which point, what is the real value of the relationship you control?). Even though she's been in many other movies in her young career, in my opinion Zoe Kazan is THE break-out star of the movie, as not only did she write the movie's screenplay but her performance on the screen just oozes charm. Not that he doesn't do a good job, but I can't really say the same about Paul Dano (Kazan and Dano are also a couple in real life). And there are some real choice moments for Antonio Banderas and Annette Benning as Calvin's parents.

1542100,A3006WHOAYJRLI,B008220BA2,Poogy,"[1, 2]","Ruby Sparks presents a metafantasy, very reminiscent of Stranger Than Fiction and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, about a writer creating a Dream Girlfriend who becomes real, and the logistical and metaphysical problems that result. The film raises the inevitable questions about the influence on a relationship of one person's attempts to control the other, since the writer who creates Ruby has the power to ""write"" her however he pleases, even after she has come into being. The result is a mixture of romantic comedy with a bit of creepiness; we all have a selfish and even dark side, but few have such an opportunity to give it free rein.I found all of the acting game and competent but predictable, not because the actors aren't talented--they are--but because their roles tended to slide into cliche.  The self-involved, introverted writer; his cynical, snarky brother; the quirky, spunky girlfriend; the hippy mother and her hippy sculptor boyfriend from Big Sur. The film kept my interest throughout, as I waited to see how it all worked out, or didn't, but it didn't break much new ground.(Notably, the screenplay was written by Zoe Kazan, who also stars in the title role.  Ironically, although the film conveys (rather heavy-handedly, I thought) the notion that control in a relationship backfires--if a guy indulges in it, he may kill the golden goose--in truth it is Zoe Kazan herself who writes a male character who she makes dance to her didactic tune....)",4,"Enjoyable, But Lacks Depth",1358121600,"01 14, 2013",2013,1479,"['Ruby', 'Sparks', 'metafantasy', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'writer', 'creating', 'Dream', 'Girlfriend', 'who', 'real', 'logistical', 'metaphysical', 'problems', 'result', 'film', 'inevitable', 'questions', 'influence', 'relationship', 'one', 'person', 'attempts', 'control', 'other', 'writer', 'who', 'Ruby', 'power', 'write', 'however', 'even', 'come', 'being', 'result', 'mixture', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'bit', 'creepiness', 'have', 'selfish', 'even', 'dark', 'side', 'few', 'have', 'opportunity', 'give', 'free', 'rein.I', 'found', 'acting', 'game', 'competent', 'predictable', 'not', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'talented', 'are', 'roles', 'tended', 'slide', 'cliche', 'self-involved', 'introverted', 'writer', 'cynical', 'snarky', 'brother', 'quirky', 'spunky', 'girlfriend', 'hippy', 'mother', 'hippy', 'sculptor', 'boyfriend', 'Big', 'Sur', 'film', 'kept', 'interest', 'waited', 'see', 'how', 'worked', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'break', 'much', 'new', 'ground', 'Notably', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'who', 'also', 'title', 'role', 'Ironically', 'film', 'conveys', 'rather', 'heavy-handedly', 'thought', 'notion', 'control', 'relationship', 'guy', 'may', 'kill', 'golden', 'goose', 'truth', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'who', 'male', 'character', 'who', 'dance', 'didactic', 'tune']",N/A

He can't stop writing his story about this girl, until one day he finds her in his kitchen. Somehow he has literally written her into his life.Paul Dano, who plays Calvin, was great. He reminded me a lot of Andrew McCarthy and his character in St. Elmo's Fire - a cute, angsty, sensitive writer. Zoe Kazan shows great range as Ruby going through changes as Calvin ""tweaks"" her. Annette Bening is wonderfully serene as Calvin's mother and Antonio Banderas is super sexy as her husband Mort, even with gray hair and a beard.Kazan also wrote the screenplay, which raises interesting questions about whether or not it would actually be a good thing to be able to design and control your mate.

While this bit of meta-commentary on the movie is not necessary and goes on for a bit too long, it's still an appreciated antidote to the weird stalker tropes that have been invaded romcoms since the 1980s.I suppose the best way to gauge whether or not you are going to like this movie is to judge why you loved or hated(500) Days Of Summer. If you think that that movie is about a guy who falls in love with a perfect woman who breaks his heart, then this movie might irk you. However, if you find yourself sympathizing with the Zoe Deschanel character who is being forced to play the role of the perfect girlfriend (or MPDG) even as she has her own life and desires that don't include Tom, then you'll love this movie.Paul Dano plays a writer who writes a MPDG in his fiction who comes off like the perfect woman at first but then slowly begins to assert her independence. His attempts at control only backfire and the movie works as both a romance and a comment on the perfect romance as depicted in movies that seem geared to the emotionally stunted.",5,"If you are familiar with (sick of) the MPDG trope, you'll love this movie",1360022400,"02 5, 2013",2013,1367,"['point', 'end', 'movie', 'where', 'oh-so-sensitive', 'writer', 'character', 'played', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'cloyingly', 'best', 'up', 'confronting', 'ex-girlfriend', 'who', 'right', 'back', 'how', 'never', 'knew', 'just', 'filled', 'blanks', 'based', 'what', 'thought', 'perfect', 'romance', 'should', 'be', 'bit', 'meta-commentary', 'movie', 'not', 'necessary', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'still', 'appreciated', 'antidote', 'weird', 'stalker', 'tropes', 'have', 'been', 'invaded', 'romcoms', '1980s.I', 'suppose', 'best', 'way', 'gauge', 'not', 'are', 'going', 'like', 'movie', 'judge', 'why', 'loved', 'hated', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'think', 'movie', 'guy', 'who', 'love', 'perfect', 'woman', 'who', 'heart', 'then', 'movie', 'might', 'irk', 'However', 'find', 'sympathizing', 'Zoe', 'Deschanel', 'character', 'who', 'being', 'forced', 'play', 'role', 'perfect', 'girlfriend', 'MPDG', 'even', 'own', 'life', 'desires', 'do', ""n't"", 'include', 'Tom', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie.Paul', 'Dano', 'writer', 'who', 'MPDG', 'fiction', 'who', 'perfect', 'woman', 'first', 'then', 'slowly', 'assert', 'independence', 'attempts', 'control', 'only', 'backfire', 'movie', 'romance', 'comment', 'perfect', 'romance', 'depicted', 'movies', 'seem', 'geared', 'emotionally', 'stunted']",N/A

Magically, Ruby (Zoe Kazan) begins to physically materialize into Calvin's life as the novel progresses, much to his astonishment. The two fall desperately in love but when Ruby begins to demonstrate a mind of her own, Calvin, a control freak, discovers he can manipulate her behavior by just changing the manuscript, leading to comical mixed results.As a huge fan of legendary director, Elia Kazan, I was initially drawn to this film because his granddaughter, Zoe Kazan, is the lead actress and screenwriter.  Kazan and Dano, partners in real life, give nice performances. Zoe's just as cute as a button and as spunky as her grandfather. The talented cast includes Annette Bening, Elliot Gould, and Antonio Bandaris.Ruby Sparks is a delightful little film with some wonderful messages about relationships and life's priorities.

Calvin (Dano) was a young phenom author when he was a teen and wrote what could become an American classic. The last few years though he has struggled and is the middle of a bad case of writer's block. When his psychiatrist gives him an idea Calvin begins to type, and comes up with a woman named Ruby Sparks (Kazan) a character he made up that somehow becomes real and he begins to fall in love with her. Then things get complicated. Once again I will start off by saying that it is only a matter of time before Paul Dano will win an Oscar, he is so effortless and believable that you really feel for every character he becomes. This movie is very interesting and pretty original (which you know I like). The one thing I really liked about this movie is that as absurd as the premise is the movie really dealt with the serious and moral issues that arise from an event like this and there is a part toward the end that is a little disturbing but absolutely perfect in explaining the moral question of should this keep going. This movie is a love story at heart but in no way the typical ""Hollywood"" love story and ironically feels very real. If you are a fan of the little quirky love story movies then this will be perfect for you. I really enjoyed it more then I expected to. Overall, not really what I would call a perfect date movie but a nice little quirky love story that feels real even though the premise is very original and different.

1542121,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B008220BA2,Turfseer,"[1, 2]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Ruby Sparks', a romantic comedy-drama written by Zoe Kazan, was directed by Dayton and Faris, the same team that directed the unfortunate 'Little Miss Sunshine'. I'm happy to report, however, that 'Ruby' is a much better film than Dayton and Faris' much acclaimed but smug previous effort.The protagonist is Calvin Weir-Fields, a one-hit wonder of a novelist who's now suffering from writer's block. Calvin has a dream where he meets a young woman (Ruby Sparks) who he's extremely attracted to. He relates the dream to his therapist, Dr. Rosenthal (played by the 60s legend, Elliot Gould) and confesses he's falling in love with her.When Calvin finds the a real-life Ruby in his kitchen, he soon seeks confirmation from others to see if she's real. Sure enough, even his brother confirms that she's flesh and blood. Calvin soon realizes that he can mold Ruby into anything he wants, by merely typing character descriptions on his typewriter (Calvin is something of a Luddite, eschewing computers in favor his old typewriter).Kazan provides no logical explanation as to why Ruby is transformed into a real person. I thought for a second that the typewriter might have some magical properties, but Kazan fails to suggest that. You simply have to accept the screenwriter's conceit and play along with the fanciful premise.After Calvin promises his brother that he won't adjust Ruby's personality by not writing anymore character descriptions, his perfect image of his beloved Ruby is shattered when she becomes horribly jealous when a homely fan of his attempts to get his attention. Things get worse during a visit to Calvin's mother, Gertrude, a hippie type played by Annette Benning. Ruby starts hanging out with others and narcissistic Calvin becomes more and more gloomy.Calvin breaks his promise to his brother and begins typing out new instructions on the typewriter, which alters Ruby's personality. When Calvin writes Ruby is ""miserable"" without him, she becomes overly clingy. When he writes that she's filled with ""effervescent joy"", she becomes happy all the time--too boring for Calvin to deal with.When Calvin takes Ruby to a colleague's party (Langdon Tharp), he fails to realize that his former girlfriend, Lila, is right about him: that he sees all women in an idealized light. Meanwhile, Ruby strips to her underwear and goes swimming in a pool, exhorted by Tharp.Calvin brings Ruby back home and reveals that she's a figment of his imagination. At this point in the film, I felt the writing got a little weak as Calvin, supposedly full of imagination, merely spits out one line epigrams, causing Ruby to adopt different personae in rapid-fire succession. Perhaps what would have been better was for Calvin to have dreamed up some more complicated scenarios, forcing him to use his imagination to escape a now more maniacal Ruby.Kazan gets it right when Calvin overcomes his self-absorption, and sets Ruby free. And I also liked how Calvin ends up meeting a 'normal' Ruby, who has no memory of her life as a figment of Calvin's literary imagination.'Ruby Sparks' is an enjoyable fable about how one man overcomes a bad tendency to idealize women. The premise of a flesh and blood Ruby suddenly appearing straight out of a writer's imagination without any kind of explanation is a troubling conceit. A good deal of the film is clever but there are moments (particularly before the denouement) that the film's scenarist doesn't know how to raise the stakes, instead resorting to slapstick, to create her second act crisis.I would recommend 'Ruby Sparks' as there is a definite lesson to be learned here about overcoming one's own narcissism. Some of the plot mechanics could have been sharpened but with fine performances (particularly Paul Dano as Calvin), and the film's author, Zoe Kazan, as the mercurial Ruby, one will certainly have no objection to taking such a reassuring, whimsical ride.",3,Writer's blocked novelist conjures up idealized girl of his dreams in this entertaining tale of pure whimsy,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,3950,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'Ruby"", 'Sparks', 'romantic', 'comedy-drama', 'written', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'was', 'directed', 'Dayton', 'Faris', 'same', 'team', 'directed', 'unfortunate', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'however', ""'Ruby"", 'much', 'better', 'film', 'Dayton', 'Faris', 'much', 'acclaimed', 'smug', 'previous', 'effort.The', 'protagonist', 'Calvin', 'Weir-Fields', 'one-hit', 'wonder', 'novelist', 'who', 'now', 'suffering', 'writer', 'block', 'Calvin', 'dream', 'where', 'young', 'woman', 'Ruby', 'Sparks', 'who', 'extremely', 'attracted', 'dream', 'therapist', 'Dr.', 'Rosenthal', 'played', '60s', 'legend', 'Elliot', 'Gould', 'falling', 'love', 'her.When', 'Calvin', 'real-life', 'Ruby', 'kitchen', 'soon', 'confirmation', 'others', 'see', 'real', 'Sure', 'enough', 'even', 'brother', 'flesh', 'blood', 'Calvin', 'soon', 'can', 'mold', 'Ruby', 'anything', 'merely', 'typing', 'character', 'descriptions', 'typewriter', 'Calvin', 'something', 'Luddite', 'eschewing', 'computers', 'favor', 'old', 'typewriter', '.Kazan', 'logical', 'explanation', 'why', 'Ruby', 'transformed', 'real', 'person', 'thought', 'second', 'typewriter', 'might', 'have', 'magical', 'properties', 'Kazan', 'suggest', 'simply', 'have', 'accept', 'screenwriter', 'conceit', 'play', 'along', 'fanciful', 'premise.After', 'Calvin', 'brother', 'wo', ""n't"", 'adjust', 'Ruby', 'personality', 'not', 'writing', 'anymore', 'character', 'descriptions', 'perfect', 'image', 'beloved', 'Ruby', 'shattered', 'when', 'horribly', 'jealous', 'when', 'homely', 'fan', 'attempts', 'get', 'attention', 'Things', 'get', 'worse', 'visit', 'Calvin', 'mother', 'Gertrude', 'hippie', 'type', 'played', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'Ruby', 'hanging', 'out', 'others', 'narcissistic', 'Calvin', 'more', 'more', 'gloomy.Calvin', 'promise', 'brother', 'typing', 'out', 'new', 'instructions', 'typewriter', 'Ruby', 'personality', 'When', 'Calvin', 'Ruby', 'miserable', 'overly', 'clingy', 'When', 'filled', 'effervescent', 'joy', 'happy', 'time', 'too', 'boring', 'Calvin', 'deal', 'with.When', 'Calvin', 'Ruby', 'colleague', 'party', 'Langdon', 'Tharp', 'realize', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'Lila', 'right', 'women', 'idealized', 'light', 'Meanwhile', 'Ruby', 'underwear', 'swimming', 'pool', 'exhorted', 'Tharp.Calvin', 'brings', 'Ruby', 'back', 'home', 'reveals', 'figment', 'imagination', 'point', 'film', 'felt', 'writing', 'got', 'little', 'weak', 'Calvin', 'supposedly', 'full', 'imagination', 'merely', 'out', 'one', 'line', 'epigrams', 'causing', 'Ruby', 'adopt', 'different', 'personae', 'rapid-fire', 'succession', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'was', 'Calvin', 'have', 'dreamed', 'up', 'more', 'complicated', 'scenarios', 'forcing', 'use', 'imagination', 'escape', 'now', 'more', 'maniacal', 'Ruby.Kazan', 'right', 'when', 'Calvin', 'self-absorption', 'sets', 'Ruby', 'free', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'Calvin', 'up', 'meeting', ""'normal"", 'Ruby', 'who', 'memory', 'life', 'figment', 'Calvin', 'literary', 'imagination', 'Sparks', 'enjoyable', 'fable', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'bad', 'tendency', 'idealize', 'women', 'premise', 'flesh', 'blood', 'Ruby', 'suddenly', 'appearing', 'straight', 'writer', 'imagination', 'kind', 'explanation', 'troubling', 'conceit', 'good', 'deal', 'film', 'clever', 'are', 'moments', 'particularly', 'denouement', 'film', 'scenarist', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'raise', 'stakes', 'instead', 'resorting', 'slapstick', 'create', 'second', 'act', 'crisis.I', 'would', 'recommend', ""'Ruby"", 'Sparks', 'definite', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'here', 'overcoming', 'one', 'own', 'narcissism', 'plot', 'mechanics', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'sharpened', 'fine', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Calvin', 'film', 'author', 'Zoe', 'Kazan', 'mercurial', 'Ruby', 'one', 'will', 'certainly', 'have', 'objection', 'taking', 'such', 'reassuring', 'whimsical', 'ride']",N/A
