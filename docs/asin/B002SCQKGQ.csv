It's so hard to understand what he is saying. I have the TV turned up to loud just to hear him & have to replay & replay because of the way he talks. The other problem is the music. I don't know why, but the British have always had a problem with which is more important, music or listening to the person talking. When the music overplays the talking, it's a waste of time trying to figure out what the person is saying. Music should be LOW so you can hear the person speaking. It seems all of British shows have this problem. Scenery is terrific. We're half way thru the series & I feel as though we should start over because we can't understand what he is saying.

1286613,A2USC5JIGJ16SG,B002SCQKGQ,Chris Linke,"[47, 49]","I loved Simon Schama's ""A History of Britain."" When I heard about ""A History of Scotland,"" hosted by Neil Oliver, I was intrigued. Never having heard of Oliver before, I wasn't sure what to expect. Surprisingly, the two hosts are quite similar in how they present their histories, and in a way, they succinctly represent their respective nations: Schama's delivery is unctuously English, Oliver's is passionately Scottish.The first sensation you feel as you begin to watch ""A History of Scotland"" is one of time travel. The gorgeous scenic footage of Scotland could have been shot in 1009 as easily as 2009. And as Oliver narrates, it seems as if the ancient land itself is telling you its story.Historical recreations also illustrate Scotland's history, and their production value is quite good. But you can only do so much in that manner, so Oliver's on-camera appearances help to glue everything together. His storytelling style is enjoyable, although occasionally, his walking-away, talking-over-the-shoulder standups remind me a bit of Eric Idle leading us to the house where he was born in ""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life.""Not being terribly knowledgeable about Scotland's history, I can only take Oliver at his word as far as historical accuracy goes. There's no way to share every story from Scotland's long history, but over four DVDs, what stories Oliver does tell are detailed and rich. Not a dry recitation of names and dates, but a portrayal of emotions from flesh-and-blood historic figures. Oliver also does a fine job of coalescing the sometimes confusing relationship between Scottish kings, the British monarchy and religion into an understandable narrative. Perfect for those of us who sometimes can't get our Jameses and Jacobites straight.Disc Five contains a two-part series called ""How The Celts Saved Britain,"" hosted by Dan Snow. It's not as entertaining as ""A History of Scotland,"" and Snow, though competent enough, isn't quite as engaging as Oliver. But it is still a collection of historical information guaranteed to put a few new wrinkles on your brain.",4,Enjoyable and beautiful,1289779200,"11 15, 2010",2010,2088,"['loved', 'Simon', 'Schama', 'A', 'History', 'Britain', 'When', 'heard', 'A', 'History', 'Scotland', 'hosted', 'Neil', 'Oliver', 'was', 'intrigued', 'Never', 'having', 'heard', 'Oliver', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'Surprisingly', 'two', 'hosts', 'are', 'quite', 'similar', 'how', 'present', 'histories', 'way', 'succinctly', 'represent', 'respective', 'nations', 'Schama', 'delivery', 'unctuously', 'English', 'Oliver', 'passionately', 'Scottish.The', 'first', 'sensation', 'feel', 'begin', 'watch', 'A', 'History', 'Scotland', 'one', 'time', 'travel', 'gorgeous', 'scenic', 'footage', 'Scotland', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shot', '1009', 'easily', '2009', 'Oliver', 'ancient', 'land', 'telling', 'story.Historical', 'recreations', 'also', 'illustrate', 'Scotland', 'history', 'production', 'value', 'quite', 'good', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'manner', 'Oliver', 'on-camera', 'appearances', 'help', 'glue', 'everything', 'together', 'storytelling', 'style', 'enjoyable', 'occasionally', 'walking-away', 'talking-over-the-shoulder', 'standups', 'remind', 'bit', 'Eric', 'Idle', 'leading', 'house', 'where', 'was', 'born', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Meaning', 'Life', 'Not', 'being', 'terribly', 'knowledgeable', 'Scotland', 'history', 'can', 'only', 'take', 'Oliver', 'word', 'as', 'far', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'way', 'share', 'story', 'Scotland', 'long', 'history', 'four', 'DVDs', 'what', 'Oliver', 'tell', 'are', 'detailed', 'rich', 'Not', 'dry', 'recitation', 'names', 'dates', 'portrayal', 'emotions', 'flesh-and-blood', 'historic', 'figures', 'Oliver', 'also', 'fine', 'job', 'coalescing', 'sometimes', 'confusing', 'relationship', 'Scottish', 'kings', 'British', 'monarchy', 'religion', 'understandable', 'narrative', 'Perfect', 'who', 'sometimes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'Jameses', 'Jacobites', 'straight.Disc', 'Five', 'two-part', 'series', 'called', 'How', 'Celts', 'Saved', 'Britain', 'hosted', 'Dan', 'Snow', 'not', 'as', 'entertaining', 'A', 'History', 'Scotland', 'Snow', 'competent', 'enough', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'engaging', 'Oliver', 'still', 'collection', 'historical', 'information', 'guaranteed', 'put', 'few', 'new', 'wrinkles', 'brain']",A History of Scotland (2010) [Region2] Requires a Multi Region Player

1286616,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B002SCQKGQ,FYI,"[1, 2]","So much better than Schama! The story of Cin&aacute;ed mac Ailp&iacute;n, or Kenneth MacAlphin, is well told. The narrative avoids pontificating bombast and presents a fresh historical perspective. Neil Oliver untangles myths and presents facts through the lens of actual archeological evidence. Great moment (among many) in the first episode, when Oliver asks a librarian in France if the book of ""lost"" records of Kings could be returned to Scotland. Oliver vividly unearths epic battles too long forgotten, like the Battle of Brunanburh in 937, a turning point in history.Scotland's landscape is beautifully filmed, and the maps are a treat. Thankfully, Scotland's Biggest Liar, Sir Walter Scott, is revealed as a spin-maker, notorious bigot, and sycophant to the King; he was also a raving antisemite. The series lacks a few points of focus, oddly omitting portraits of historic figures, images which would have helped flesh out the characters. As well, it's never mentioned is that the second husband of Mary, Queen of Scots, Lord Darley, helped kill Mary's advisor, prior to his own murder. The series runs out of steam towards the conclusion, rapidly skipping through the Battle of Culloden. The final episode drags on interminably, splicing repetitive scenes together: slow-motion shots of factory furnaces imploding, molten steel pouring, depressing old guys in an old-folks bar, and the cracked asphalt of a bleak urban landscape. There is no full-circle to conclude, no completion with scenes of The Stone of Destiny being returned to a renewed Scottish nation.Overall, this is a great series, wish it could have been longer; perhaps towards the end funding ran short. Neil Oliver is an excellent narrator, who has worked at Scotland's Kilmartin site, near Dunadd, the seat of the Kingdom of D&aacute;l Riata.

1286617,A1G9FX1KV45N41,B002SCQKGQ,Gary Selikow,"[2, 3]","A compelling and informative 10 part series taking us through the history of Scotland from prehistoric man until today. Neil Oliver presents this with a passion for his county and for his history, a penetrating understanding and panache for the dramatic and with a brutal honesty.Certainly Oliver is a master presenter-he keeps the viewer gripped, and certainly this is well researched. Through the history of Scotland and and how it has been shaped by its adversarial and sometimes subordinate role to England, we explore the people and landscapes of Scotland , with excellent cinematography of landscapes, churches and castles, cities, towns and villages and recreated scenes from history.We learn something of the exploits of Columba, Kenneth McAlpine, William Wallace, Robert the Bruce, Mary Queen of Scots, Walter Scott Adam Smith, John McCormick, and Jock McConall.Oliver takes us through the formation of the Scottish nation from Scots, Picts and Vikings,  both the brutality of the civil wars fought between Scottish nobles and kings, and the centuries long struggle with the English, to Scotland's pivotal role in the origins and particulars of the English civil wars, the deprivations and death suffered by the Scottish people during the Highland potato famine, the great exploitations and suffering visited upon Scottish workers and their families, the Scottish struggles over independence self-determination and devolution and between ideological systems in the 20th century, and ends with an eye to the future.Interesting and appalling to read how the British government did not aid the people suffering and dying form the Highland famine due to not wanting to 'interfere with free markets', that more Scottish children died of hunger between the two world wars as Scottish soldiers had been killed in the first world war, and the anger of the Scottish people at the deprivations, unemployment and brutal cuts in welfare by Margaret Thatcher in the 80s, given that very few Scots voted for her , and the Scottish people felt they were being subjected to punishment by a government not of their choosing.Certainly the Scots, Irish Welsh and English proletariat have all suffered deprivations of the Industrial Revolution that match those of black slaves and the peoples of the third world, therefore none of the working classes in the British islands should have to suffer from affirmative action or any form of 'positive discrimination' against the indigenous inhabitants of the isles.",5,compelling story of a brave nation,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,2498,"['compelling', 'informative', '10', 'part', 'series', 'taking', 'history', 'Scotland', 'prehistoric', 'man', 'today', 'Neil', 'Oliver', 'passion', 'county', 'history', 'penetrating', 'understanding', 'panache', 'dramatic', 'brutal', 'honesty.Certainly', 'Oliver', 'master', 'presenter-he', 'viewer', 'gripped', 'certainly', 'well', 'researched', 'history', 'Scotland', 'how', 'been', 'shaped', 'adversarial', 'sometimes', 'subordinate', 'role', 'England', 'explore', 'people', 'landscapes', 'Scotland', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'landscapes', 'churches', 'castles', 'cities', 'towns', 'villages', 'recreated', 'scenes', 'history.We', 'learn', 'something', 'exploits', 'Columba', 'Kenneth', 'McAlpine', 'William', 'Wallace', 'Robert', 'Bruce', 'Mary', 'Queen', 'Scots', 'Walter', 'Scott', 'Adam', 'Smith', 'John', 'McCormick', 'Jock', 'McConall.Oliver', 'formation', 'Scottish', 'nation', 'Scots', 'Picts', 'Vikings', 'brutality', 'civil', 'wars', 'fought', 'Scottish', 'nobles', 'kings', 'centuries', 'long', 'struggle', 'English', 'Scotland', 'pivotal', 'role', 'origins', 'particulars', 'English', 'civil', 'wars', 'deprivations', 'death', 'suffered', 'Scottish', 'people', 'Highland', 'potato', 'famine', 'great', 'exploitations', 'suffering', 'visited', 'Scottish', 'workers', 'families', 'Scottish', 'struggles', 'independence', 'self-determination', 'devolution', 'ideological', 'systems', '20th', 'century', 'eye', 'future.Interesting', 'appalling', 'read', 'how', 'British', 'government', 'did', 'not', 'aid', 'people', 'suffering', 'dying', 'form', 'Highland', 'famine', 'due', 'not', 'wanting', ""'interfere"", 'free', 'markets', 'more', 'Scottish', 'children', 'died', 'hunger', 'two', 'world', 'wars', 'Scottish', 'soldiers', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'first', 'world', 'war', 'anger', 'Scottish', 'people', 'deprivations', 'unemployment', 'brutal', 'cuts', 'welfare', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', '80s', 'given', 'very', 'few', 'Scots', 'voted', 'Scottish', 'people', 'felt', 'were', 'being', 'subjected', 'punishment', 'government', 'not', 'choosing.Certainly', 'Scots', 'Irish', 'Welsh', 'English', 'proletariat', 'have', 'suffered', 'deprivations', 'Industrial', 'Revolution', 'match', 'black', 'slaves', 'peoples', 'third', 'world', 'none', 'working', 'classes', 'British', 'islands', 'should', 'have', 'suffer', 'affirmative', 'action', 'form', ""'positive"", 'discrimination', 'indigenous', 'inhabitants', 'isles']",A History of Scotland (2010) [Region2] Requires a Multi Region Player

The early portion of the formation of one country revealed much new information. Wallace at Stirling Bridge, The Bruce at Bannockburn and the Declaration of Arbroath remain the defining incidents in the forging of the nation. The disaster of Flodden was never covered; maybe just as well! A frank account of the Young Pretender's (Bonnie Prince Charlie's) attempt to re-impose a Catholic Crown on Protestant Great Britain helps correct the Scottish versus English fabrication. A bigger fabrication was Walter Scott's role in the 'tartanisation' of Scotland; brilliant marketing but a deflection of the essential character of the country.

1286622,AZMMN9R6QIL0Y,B002SCQKGQ,Jeffrey R. Charles,"[1, 2]","Watching the History of Scotland was an excellent experience. I began getting into more material about Ireland and Scotland, etc., after recently finding that I have some Celtic heritage, but mainly from Ireland and the Isle of Man rather than Scotland. Unlike many other documentaries, the History of Scotland (whether intended or unintentional) uniquely revealed the human tragedy that generations of ordinary people had to endure under the feudal societies that dominated much of Europe over many centuries.What was particularly interesting (and shocking) was where, in Episode 7 (this is the SPOILER ALERT part), it was indicated that only those who had land holdings of a certain size could vote in 17th century Scotland, which ultimately led to the loss of Scotland's independence (via union with England) through the short-sighted votes of less than 4,000 people! Some of these same few voting people previously lost money (25 percent of the net worth of all in Scotland) by making bad investments in the Darien scheme in Central America, and were allegedly paid for their votes by others who wanted union.  It shows that bad things can happen when only a few control all the land and/or wealth of a country.I also liked the extra DVD in the set called ""How the Celts Saved Britain"". The series had a little repetition in the footage, but when you consider that the episodes would be seen a week apart by most, I doubt that this would be noticed.

1286624,A16XRPF40679KG,B002SCQKGQ,Michael Dobey,"[0, 0]","This is the story of scotland, or pictland as it was called until 900 a.d.I used to think the picts just vanished until I saw this series. In fact they justmerged with the rest of physical scotland and that's that. The show is well narrated and has fantastic senery throughout. The show is one mans view of things and the perhaps the purest in a historical sense. The show however is just excellent and covers 2,000 years of history. He doesn't cover prehistorical times very much but it is the story of scotland the nation , more than the physical landmass. This show has alot of animated maps and other great ideas to help you get a idea of what is happening as he narrates. And the narrator is easy to understand in this one. I reject the review that you can't understand him. He is very clear in this show and the show follows an easy narrative.  Each episode starts in a time period and ends in a time period. It's a overview , but with ten episodes , you get alot of information. And no other filmed history of  Scotland is as clear as detailed as this one is. It's ten hours long after all. It was a whole one season tv series and it's worth you time. You will learn alot about Scotlands history. On later episodes you get more political perhaps as one reviewer stated , but it's his view and you can decide wether you agree or not. One thing is for sure this is a great show and without a doubt Scotland is far better off as part of the Uk then it would be as a seperate nation. The same goes for Wales, and the ilse of man. This was filmed in hd , although this is only a standard dvd , it's stunning. So sit back and learn alot in a entertaining way. You will meet some of the great characters in Scotish History in this series too. Robert the bruce, William Wallace, Alexander 3, Constatine and duncan,  and many others like the stuarts.The show is more than a history of kings though , it is the history of a nation. And it includes Dan Snows 'how the celts saved Britain"".  This two part series tells how the irish church and christianity saved the Britain from the savagery  that ruled the land after the fall of the Roman empire. And there is no doubt that people were far better off under the new order rather than the old war gods.

1286626,A15HUGZ6MHPL16,B002SCQKGQ,"Pamela S. Dorris ""eternally learning""","[7, 8]","Some years ago as my flight for the states took off from London's Gatwick airport, the pilot did a 180 turn and headed upland.  As luck would have it, it was a gorgeous day and the plane maintained a lower altitude rather than immediately climbing to 35,000 feet.  As a result, I was treated to a panoramic view below of the rolling hills and small towns of England with its patchwork fields.  Not too much later, the terrain changed radically and became thickly clustered with hills and mountains, seemingly devoid of cities.  Quite frankly, I didn't know what I was looking at, and only after I'd gotten home and pulled out an atlas did I realize I'd had an amazing flyover of Scotland.  At that moment I vowed to return to Great Britain and check Scotland out for myself.  Five years later I did so, and found it to be the most beautiful spot on earth.  The scenery in Scotland is SO extraordinarily lovely that twice I was reduced to tears at its magnificence.What I love about A HISTORY OF SCOTLAND is its unrestrained use of spectacular photography coupled with a thorough and pithy explanation of Scottish history, which is turbulent at best and not the easiest thing to get your mind around.  The appealing narrator, Neil Oliver, never allows your attention to wander.  His narrative style carries with it charm and a sense of energy that makes the material anything but dry.It was so good to re-experience Scotland through this DVD, and whether you're planning a trip there (lucky you!), or probably won't make it in this lifetime, the next best thing is this DVD.

1286627,APBNLLYCJM8YE,B002SCQKGQ,"Roy Anderson ""War Buff - and civilian combatt...","[4, 9]","Neil Oliver first came to my notice through the excellent BBC programme 'COAST'. His engaging and easy going manner added hugely to the programmes worth, in my opinion and, after he had been THE narator and become a segment narator, his easy manner and love of his subject became even more pronounced.Consequently, I was very keen to view his 'Hisoty of Scotland'. The History started off quite well, with the early hisotry found ost interesting - and largely completely untold previously. Sadly the promise was not fulfilled!The closer one got to the 'modern times', the more the Hisotry became 'political' and hugely a record of personal opinion. It wasn't that all the views were clearly incorrect or fallacious, but many were most certainly arguable, For axample, the reasons for the death of the Shipbuilding industry, the Coal mineing industry, the huge alteration in the Steel industry and the nationalised Rail Service were all reported in a very one-sided manner.In some nstances throughout the programme, fairness was clearly exercised, but sadly not uniformly. This detracted greatly from the programmme's worth and value.As others have alluded, many great characters in Scotalnd's hisotry were missing from the owrk - or greatly minimised in the telling. Others, were glorified beyond worth.No! One has to state that parts of the history were interesting, but the worth of the views suffered because of the bias show in other aspects.",2,Could and should have been better.,1312761600,"08 8, 2011",2011,1446,"['Neil', 'Oliver', 'first', 'came', 'notice', 'excellent', 'BBC', 'programme', ""'COAST"", 'engaging', 'easy', 'going', 'manner', 'added', 'hugely', 'programmes', 'worth', 'opinion', 'had', 'been', 'THE', 'narator', 'become', 'segment', 'narator', 'easy', 'manner', 'love', 'subject', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'pronounced.Consequently', 'was', 'very', 'keen', 'view', ""'Hisoty"", 'Scotland', 'History', 'started', 'off', 'quite', 'well', 'early', 'hisotry', 'found', 'ost', 'interesting', 'largely', 'completely', 'untold', 'previously', 'Sadly', 'promise', 'was', 'not', 'fulfilled', 'closer', 'one', 'got', ""'modern"", 'times', 'more', 'Hisotry', 'became', ""'political"", 'hugely', 'record', 'personal', 'opinion', 'was', ""n't"", 'views', 'were', 'clearly', 'incorrect', 'fallacious', 'many', 'were', 'most', 'certainly', 'arguable', 'axample', 'reasons', 'death', 'Shipbuilding', 'industry', 'Coal', 'mineing', 'industry', 'huge', 'alteration', 'Steel', 'industry', 'nationalised', 'Rail', 'Service', 'were', 'reported', 'very', 'one-sided', 'manner.In', 'nstances', 'programme', 'fairness', 'was', 'clearly', 'exercised', 'sadly', 'not', 'uniformly', 'detracted', 'greatly', 'programmme', 'worth', 'value.As', 'others', 'have', 'alluded', 'many', 'great', 'characters', 'Scotalnd', 'hisotry', 'were', 'missing', 'owrk', 'greatly', 'minimised', 'telling', 'Others', 'were', 'glorified', 'worth.No', 'One', 'state', 'parts', 'history', 'were', 'interesting', 'worth', 'views', 'suffered', 'bias', 'show', 'other', 'aspects']",A History of Scotland (2010) [Region2] Requires a Multi Region Player
