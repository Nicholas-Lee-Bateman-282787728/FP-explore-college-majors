470430,A1EI65WJC85U68,6305602360,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[10, 12]","First off sorry about the poetry. I have a workmate who keeps saying stuff like this, so I think it's rubbing off on me. I considered banging my head against the wall in frustration, but decided against it on the chance that a strong blow to the head could cause me to become normal (ha ha).DRILLER KILLER opens with the notice: THIS FILM SHOULD BE PLAYED LOUD.  The film makes the feature directing debut of cult legend Abel Ferrara, and along with MS .45 remains in my opinion among his finest work.  Ferrara is also the lead actor, under the pseudonym Jimmy Laine, Ferrara plays Reno Miller; a struggling artist, living in a cheap apartment with his roommate Carol (Carolyn Marz) and her lesbian lover Pamela (Baybi Day).Reno is currently under a lot of pressure at work. He has been given one week to complete his next painting or he will find himself unemployed.  That may sound bad enough, but to make matters worse for Reno if he doesn't pay his rent on time his landlord (Alan Winroth) will evict him.  Add to this a deluge of mentally ill vagrants littering the streets outside his apartment block & a Z- grade punk rock group (The Roosters, who sound like The Jesus Lizard, only crappier) rehearsing above his apartment. Despite Reno's complaints the building superintendent won't do anything about it. The noise doesn't bother HIM! All these distractions don't exactly help fuel Reno's creativity, in fact his artwork is not progressing well at all & gets to the point where he has psychotic episodes in which his art ""talks"" to him.However one night while sitting around watching TV with his roommate & her lesbian lover, an ad comes on for a $19.95 proto-pak drill.Reno's first victim is a poor defenceless wittle bunny wabbit which he kills by bludgeoning it with a hammer.This leads to Ferrara's notable homage to Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"", which the movie is more comparable to, rather than its expected slasher or ""video nasty"" tag of course bestowed by paranoid nitwits who never bother to watch the movies. David Lane: Are you reading this?!Then he gets his drill... I mean the movie's called DRILLER KILLER, so a hammer wouldn't work. How about a remake with Stallone as Reno? They could call it HAMMER SLAMMER, and Sly sells his own paintings too! Though it's a safe bet his wife pins them on the Stallone family fridge.Actually, the murders themselves come off as more amusing as opposed to revolting (Watch the movie & you'll understand). PASSION OF THE CHRIST is ten times bloodier than this. Seriously.A word of warning to first time viewers: It's been noted in some reviews here that others have been disappointed by the film due to its lack of gore. In fact there's only two scenes of graphic violence in the entire movie, & the first drilling, (in which a bum gets it in the forehead) doesn't happen until 40 minutes into the movie & even then, by contempory standards at least, the gore is minimal.. In retrospect its downright bloody daft how this was originally banned in the UK & NZ because a couple of stupid old biddies (namely Mary Whitehouse & Patricia Bartlett) saw a couple of movie posters, & donned their Nazi regalia spewing forth a blatantly fabricated tirade of lies and paranoia to make England & NZ boring, conservative & ignorant just like them. While I'm on the subject of censorship, I think this could have come very close to getting an R16 in NZ if it were cut (something I'm seldom in favour of). Ferrara also composed the Roosters songs under the Lane moniker.The movie is also chock full of  unintentionally hilarious dialogue aided by Ferrara's (presumably) reefer induced performance. Add to that a good lesbian shower scene thrown in for no other reason than to show some T&A.;The Australasian DVD bonuses only include trailers (but not the trailer for DRILLER KILLER), Ferrara's filmography & an intro by Xavier Mendik, Director Of The Cult Film Archive at the University College Northhampton.  Sounds like my dream job! But alas, alack, he's a pretentious twonk. And the Vidiot hates pretense. The intro's only about five minutes long, but Mendik is a huge bore with his analysis of the themes of ""urban decay"" in the movie.  I'm annoyed that the Australasian release wasn't the same as the one available here with a Director's commentary and Ferrara short films.  That's my only complaint about this.In summing up, the films detractors will be shocked to know that DRILLER KILLER is not as earlier said, a video nasty; it's not really a slasher and it doesn't actually belong in the horror category either. In actuality DRILLER KILLER is, in my opinion, one of the maverick film-makers best features along with MS .45.  It mixes a gritty bargain basement look and feel with some brilliant camerawork, an effectively menacing atmosphere and a number of simple but very effective setpieces, all of which adds up to a movie that you really ought to see at least once.  I'm definitely going to watch it again at some point in the future.",4,"""Jimmy Laine"" goes insane as ""Reno Miller""- THE DRILLER KILL",1092355200,"08 13, 2004",2004,4995,"['First', 'sorry',

However the film is not without its artistic moments -  the opening scene in a church, the reccuring television advert driving our  artist insane, the almost freudian dream-like images of him covered in  blood drilling an un-seen victim, and the soundtrack relentlessly crying  'Reno' as his madness takes its toll.While not entirely devoid of  violence, this film is definitely one for the obscure art-house film-buffs,  not for the gorehounds.

Some of the scenes drag, and some are a little too self-indulgent for my taste.  However, in my opinion, this movie is a terrific showcase of the punk scene in 70's New York, as well as a realistic snapshot into the life of a struggling artist.  It is RAW and powerful in this respect, an aquired taste but once it grows on you there's no stopping it.  It seems that few reviewers out there understand that the grittiness of the movie and its impromptu, drugged-out sequences are all part of its charm.  Plus, if you buy this edition, you get one of the most entertaining and personable commentary tracks out there.  It's not one of those high-falutin' Hollywood guys being smooth and talking big but instead a REAL PERSON, and you could almost swear he was in there with you, watching his first film.

Let me put it to you this way - If this film is a cult classic because of its ""poor story, bad direction, pointless action, missing lighting, totally useless SOUND (50% of the dialogue is not understandable), bad camerawork (including focus) and every other production value I can imagine, then I suppose I am really missing the point of what a cult classic is. In my opinion ""The Evil Dead"" is a cult classic as much as something like ""Apocolypse Now"" is. ""The Driller Killer"" is a prime example of how the government, media and some film censors can cause nations to want to see something that simply does not exist! i.e - The most disturbing scenes in a movie ever!!Seriously, by todays standards this film could receive a 15 certificate!This film is just totally void of anything that can be even be considered a ""low budget"" production value. It doesn't have any value other than being a very badly made film. There is no ""Taxi Driver"" type material in this film as some would have you believe. It is devoid of all of that.

470441,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,6305602360,Paul Donovan,"[0, 0]","Nine Things about the Film &#8220;The Driller Killer&#8221;1. This movie is about a New York artist named Reno who can&#8217;t handle the daily pressures of life and has strange visions.2. When Reno sees a commercial for a portable battery pack, he buys one and uses a power drill to kill homeless people and relieve his stress.3. This movie is interesting mostly for historical purposes. It&#8217;s the first movie that underground director Abel Ferrara directed, and he also stars in it. Also, it serves as a bridge between the early 70&#8217;s slasher films like &#8220;Halloween&#8221; and the 80&#8217;s interest in gore.4. It&#8217;s super low-budget, with terrible acting and a terrible script. And random lesbian scenes.5. But it also has a genuine punk rock sensibility that really works in its favor.  It&#8217;s an early, grungy, punk version of &#8220;American Psycho&#8221;.6. As a horror film, it&#8217;s pretty boring. There&#8217;s a lot of talking, and even more scenes of rock bands playing and rehearsing. Perhaps the movie&#8217;s biggest value is in it&#8217;s depiction of the late 1970&#8217;s New York punk scene.7. While mild by today&#8217;s standards, the kill scenes are more brutal than I was expecting.8. The movie was officially banned in Britain until 2002.9. People who are interested in the evolution of the American horror film need to see this.

Half the movie was made up of unnessecary scenes that were just there to fill time such as: the random lesbian shower scene, the annoying shots of the band practising and the disgusting scene where Reno chops up the rabbit. The reason for Reno's sudden insanity is hardley explained, he just starts drilling bums on the street, oh and by the way I think it might take a little more then one drill hole in the stomach to kill someone! And whats up with the red screen! That was just annoying! This movie is honestly horrible in every single aspect, it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and all copies of it should be destoryed! Just to make this clear to everyone I am a huge horror movie fan, this movie was just a sorry excuse for a film. The director should hang his head in shame. Cult status for this movie?
