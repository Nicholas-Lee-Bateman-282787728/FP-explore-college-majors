Basically special ops team gets wiped out by Psycho snake guy (which they deserve to get for their bad representation of a Spec Ops), sole survivor is healed with a special radiation which gives him super speed. He finds out his boss and snake guy are planning to wipe out the city of DC for revenge... Blah Blah Blah typical storyline. If there was cheese in this movie it would be a step up. the Vulgarity over-dubs are an insult to the watcher and the actors both, and the only funny line in the movie is, ""Blue, its a nice color, I've always wanted to die in blue"".Just do not get it.",1,Do Not waste your time!,1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,720,"['one', 'worst', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'would', 'allow', 'name', 'be', 'attached', 'waste', 'Basically', 'special', 'ops', 'team', 'wiped', 'out', 'Psycho', 'snake', 'guy', 'deserve', 'get', 'bad', 'representation', 'Spec', 'Ops', 'sole', 'survivor', 'healed', 'special', 'radiation', 'super', 'speed', 'out', 'boss', 'snake', 'guy', 'are', 'planning', 'wipe', 'out', 'city', 'DC', 'revenge', 'Blah', 'Blah', 'Blah', 'typical', 'storyline', 'was', 'cheese', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'step', 'up', 'Vulgarity', 'over-dubs', 'are', 'insult', 'watcher', 'actors', 'only', 'funny', 'line', 'movie', 'Blue', 'nice', 'color', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'die', 'blue', '.Just', 'do', 'not', 'get']",Lightspeed

Hulk was scarier then this and he was a good guy. no reason at this point to even concern yourself with anything else. this was it, the Python and that's it. well, him and a whole bunch of useless extra lackies. why do these movies even make an effort of using extras? they don't add at all to the overall movie. minus a few points for using extra extras.i don't think i have to go too far on to tell you this movie is pointless. if stan lee thought it was a good idea to stamp his name on this rather then spiderman then he was doing something with Jack Daniels, Corona, and Bacardi at the same time. they shouldn't have even incorperated his name on this one, even as a side project. i hate to give such a negative review, but after seeing Spiderman 3 and knowing where the comics can go, this is a great disappointment. even after spiderman 2 this is still bad. this is a B- Movie to the extreme.this is one of those terribly underfunded performances that make you wonder ""WHY?""

1029031,A3A81ZZ4ANLZ8G,B000JMKKJU,"The Critic ""Movie Maniac""","[13, 13]","Stan Lee fans will definitely come away with mixed feelings from this 2006 extremely low budget Superhero B-movie. Believe it or not this is not the worst B-movie I've ever seen, that honor still goes to ""The Warrior of the Lost World"" with Robert Ginty. Make no mistake, this is a low budget made for Television production that suffers from very poor acting by Jason Connery and most of the cast. Jason Connery may share the same last name as his famous father, but great acting ability isn't in his DNA.Jason Connery stars as Daniel Leight, a government agent and member of the elite ghost squad trying to capture the Python. During a covert mission Daniel is confronted by Python and is almost killed in an explosion. Daniel undergoes experimental treatment and after a radiation overload he discovers he has the ability to move extremely fast and after buying a wind suit from the local sports store he becomes the Superhero Lightspeed.I think this movie could have worked if someone other than Jason Connery had played Lightspeed and it had more of a story, better special effects and Superhero costume. Jason Connery appears as if he's not very athletic and given the amount of hair loss he just doesn't seem to fit the role at all. The one bright spot and only thing saving this movie from complete disaster is the role of the villain played by Daniel Goddard. In my opinion his acting is really good and he plays the part of the cold brutal killer out for revenge perfectly. The costume and make-up for the Python is really well done, it's too bad the costume for lightspeed didn't receive the same deluxe treatment.This is the only superhero movie that I've seen the hero buy his costume right off the rack. The acting from Lee Majors is nothing special and he comes off as very stiff and stale in his role as Tanner and he probably did it for a pay cheque. The part of Beth played by Nicole Eggert only confirms she definitely can't act and her role on Baywatch is about as good as she gets.For a made for Television movie the picture and sound quality are really good while everything else about this movie is average at best. In my opinion this movie is not suitable for young children due to the amount of senseless graphic violence. I would compare this film with ""The Phantom"" with Billy Zane and ""The Shadow"" with Alec Baldwin, just not as good as either of them. Fortunately for me, I didn't pay very much for this movie.",3,SUPERHERO IN A WIND SUIT !,1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,2438,"['Stan', 'Lee', 'fans', 'will', 'definitely', 'come', 'away', 'mixed', 'feelings', '2006', 'extremely', 'low', 'budget', 'Superhero', 'B-movie', 'Believe', 'not', 'not', 'worst', 'B-movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'honor', 'still', 'Warrior', 'Lost', 'World', 'Robert', 'Ginty', 'Make', 'mistake', 'low', 'budget', 'made', 'Television', 'production', 'suffers', 'very', 'poor', 'acting', 'Jason', 'Connery', 'most', 'cast', 'Jason', 'Connery', 'may', 'share', 'same', 'last', 'name', 'famous', 'father', 'great', 'acting', 'ability', ""n't"", 'DNA.Jason', 'Connery', 'Daniel', 'Leight', 'government', 'agent', 'member', 'elite', 'ghost', 'squad', 'trying', 'capture', 'Python', 'covert', 'mission', 'Daniel', 'confronted', 'Python', 'almost', 'killed', 'explosion', 'Daniel', 'undergoes', 'experimental', 'treatment', 'radiation', 'overload', 'ability', 'move', 'extremely', 'fast', 'buying', 'wind', 'suit', 'local', 'sports', 'store', 'Superhero', 'Lightspeed.I', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'someone', 'other', 'Jason', 'Connery', 'had', 'played', 'Lightspeed', 'had', 'more', 'story', 'better', 'special', 'effects', 'Superhero', 'costume', 'Jason', 'Connery', 'not', 'very', 'athletic', 'given', 'amount', 'hair', 'loss', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'role', 'one', 'bright', 'spot', 'only', 'thing', 'saving', 'movie', 'complete', 'disaster', 'role', 'villain', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Goddard', 'opinion', 'acting', 'really', 'good', 'part', 'cold', 'brutal', 'killer', 'revenge', 'perfectly', 'costume', 'make-up', 'Python', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'too', 'bad', 'costume', 'lightspeed', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'same', 'deluxe', 'treatment.This', 'only', 'superhero', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hero', 'buy', 'costume', 'right', 'off', 'rack', 'acting', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'nothing', 'special', 'off', 'very', 'stiff', 'stale', 'role', 'Tanner', 'probably', 'did', 'pay', 'cheque', 'part', 'Beth', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Eggert', 'only', 'definitely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'role', 'Baywatch', 'as', 'good', 'gets.For', 'made', 'Television', 'movie', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'everything', 'else', 'movie', 'average', 'best', 'opinion', 'movie', 'not', 'suitable', 'young', 'children', 'due', 'amount', 'senseless', 'graphic', 'violence', 'would', 'compare', 'film', 'Phantom', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'Shadow', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Fortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'very', 'much', 'movie']",Lightspeed
