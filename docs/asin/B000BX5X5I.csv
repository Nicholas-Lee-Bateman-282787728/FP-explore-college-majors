952152,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000BX5X5I,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","I don't know Ann Howard Creel from Carl ""Crusher"" Creel, but I must thank her for writing such a fine novel, THE MAGIC OF ORDINARY DAYS. Hallmark's adaptation of it is that uncommon beast: a film created for the small screen that manages to be restrained yet utterly captivating, although, come to think of it, Hallmark has a habit of churning out the quality stuff. I hadn't seen much of Keri Russell. I'd only ever known Skeet Ulrich from the apocalyptic television series JERICHO. But these two actors submit performances that are sensitive and subdued and entirely engaging.The plot goes like so: In July of 1944, a nervous Olivia (Russell) disembarks from the train. In the rural town of La Junta, Colorado she's greeted by a stoic farmer named Raymond Singleton (Ulrich). Ray is her future husband by arranged marriage, her father having ""convinced"" her of this union. Olivia - or ""Livy"" - was once a graduate student with an interest in archaeology, until her mother got sick and she had to quit school to tend to her final days. Lonely and grief-stricken, Livy fell into the arms of a stranger, some Air Force gent who was then shipped overseas. Flings sometimes have permanent consequences. Livy's father, learning of Livy's pregnancy, sent her away, it's assumed, in disgrace.Ray's beet farm stands one hour away from the nearest town, which is La Junta, and Livy is soon made aware of how isolated she is from her lifelong comforts. Livy has a yen for foreign places and exotic cultures, and so imagine her frustration at her drab new environs. As well, Livy still pines for her wayward beau, that Air Force gent. She still sneaks him the occasional letter. Ray, a stranger who's become her sudden husband, is a man of few words and those words tend to revolve around farming. It'll take time for her to learn a lesson: that still waters run deep. It doesn't take long for Raymond to fall in love with Livy, who is lovely and refined. It'll take the unhappy Livy longer to reciprocate, if she comes to reciprocate at all.Camille Thomasson deserves her propers for crafting a script that is sensitive and textured and ideally paced. There may not be flash to the story, but there's a quiet self-assuredness to how the plot is executed. Lest you forget that the narrative is unfolding during wartime conditions, a sub-plot is introduced concerning a local Japanese internment camp and the two female American-Japanese laborers whom Livy befriends. Livy is delighted to learn that the two sisters, Florence (Tania Gunadi) and Rose (Gwendoline Yeo) share her college background. I like that, in the face of the townspeople's hostility, Livy instinctively stands firm with her new friends.I appreciate that Livy's pregnancy is handled with class. I like that the movie is patient with its characters. Russell and Ulrich are allowed to fully get into the skin of their characters. Livy and Ray and their cautious relationship are carefully developed. We see Livy slowly, hesitantly embrace her new life and culture. We see Ray, a good man coping with his own bit of devastation, try so hard, in his quiet way, to please Livy.

Beautifully photographed in Canada with super, but restrained performances by the whole cast including Keri Russell, Skeet Ulrich, and a terrific Mare Winningham.A highly educated, young woman feels forced by situation and deep internal guilt after an unexpected pregnancy to move to isolated but beautiful S. Colorado to take a marriage with a total stranger in order to save face with her and her family.These are different times with WWII blazing on, unsure about the father to be's willingness to assume responsibility, and a stern, moralizing father pressuring her, and who arranges the whole marriage thing with a lonely and emotionally hurt farmer.  The woman figures to move on after the delivery, or hopes somehow to reach the other man whom she pines for.This story focuses on nice people from varied perspectives providing support and understanding rather than condemnation.  Keri's character meets and befriends Japenese- Americans interned as well as a brief excursion with a German POW.I enjoyed the interactions between basically good people stuck in an awkward place: working on the farm, floating on a boat on the lake, learning to cook, going to a dance, learning about butterflies with new friends, simple talk, discovering the depth of love and pain in others.Some might say, the whole story is too nice, too comfortable.  That's OK for me, nice change from so many brutal, in your face and over the top flicks.  Completely family friendly, but I think most kids would be bored with the underlying adult themes.P.S.
