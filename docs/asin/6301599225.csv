257377,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6301599225,David Baldwin,"[1, 1]","This is a real gem.  I never read the Faulkner source material(I unstand it's derived from three works) but this could lead to the bookshelf.  Director Martin Ritt, in his second effort after ""Edge of the City""(soon to released on DVD) shows the sure hand that he displayed in his other Southern-fried works.  The film is both sultry and ribald that it will leave you in stitches.  The dialogue is as cutting as anything this side of ""The Sweet Smell of Success"".  The casting here is impeccable.  Paul Newman is quite good here.  He demonstrates a little bit of the method that informs a lot of his early work but his work does suggest the assuredness that came later in ""The Hustler"" and ""Hud"".  Joanne Woodward, however, is masterful as the plain Jane daughter who Newman has designs on.  On paper you wouldn't think that Newman and Woodward would be a good coupling but they have kinetic chemistry onscreen that was also demonstrated in their successful offscreen marriage.  Many have compared Orson Welles' work as a Big Daddy knock-off but I found it to be a truly original rendering.  Welles walks the tightrope here between chewing the scenery and hamming it up but his daring portrayal of Will Varner is one for the ages.  Tony Franciosa gives a sympathetic turn as Varner's neglected son and Lee Remick exudes eroticism whether in a sundress or a slip.

257380,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,6301599225,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[7, 13]","I saw the LONG HOT SUMMER on the big screen back in 1958 when I was 16 and thought it was fabulous.  I'm older now, and although the film still has some appeal, mainly because of the two lead actors whom I admire very much, I didn't enjoy the film as much on the small screen today. For one thing, the detail in some shots is hard to see which might not be the case if you have a large viewing screen. For another thing, I don't think it is clear to me even yet why old man Will Varner (Orson Wells in a ""big Daddy"" type role) has it in for his son (Anthony Franciosa). Faulkner's tales, the basis of the screen play, may reveal the source of the animosity between the two men, but this film does not. The closest we come to understanding Will Varner's cruel behavior is to hear him call his son ""weak"" which does not seem to be the case for Miss Varner's equally effeminate beau who is obviously a mama's boy, and whom Will Varner would approve as the stud for his daughter if only he would ""pop"" the question. Both young men seem weak compared to the muscular, virile, tanned Newman (Ben Quick).  Furthermore, why is a beautiful girl like Joanne Woodward unmarried in the old South where couples ran off in their teens? And, what father would bribe a ""no account barn-buring drifter"" to wed his daughter? Again, the Faulkner tales probably reveal much the screen play misses.The film has it's appeal -  the actors are beautiful (including Lee Remick who went on to play acclaimed roles as drunken and/or crazy wives), and Angela Landsbury (Jessica Fletcher) is wonderful as Minnie, the long suffering mistress of Will Varner. Based on it's price, this is a good buy for your ""oldies"" film library as the story is instructive for youngsters who wonder what fueled the youthful rebellion that later culminated in Women's Movement in the late 1950s.",4,Why daughters become rebels......,1094428800,"09 6, 2004",2004,1848,"['saw', 'LONG', 'HOT', 'SUMMER', 'big', 'screen', 'back', '1958', 'when', 'was', '16', 'thought', 'was', 'fabulous', ""'m"", 'older', 'now', 'film', 'still', 'appeal', 'mainly', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'whom', 'admire', 'very', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'small', 'screen', 'today', 'one', 'thing', 'detail', 'shots', 'hard', 'see', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'have', 'large', 'viewing', 'screen', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'clear', 'even', 'yet', 'why', 'old', 'man', 'Will', 'Varner', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'big', 'Daddy', 'type', 'role', 'son', 'Anthony', 'Franciosa', 'Faulkner', 'tales', 'basis', 'screen', 'play', 'may', 'reveal', 'source', 'animosity', 'two', 'men', 'film', 'not', 'closest', 'come', 'understanding', 'Will', 'Varner', 'cruel', 'behavior', 'hear', 'call', 'son', 'weak', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'case', 'Miss', 'Varner', 'equally', 'effeminate', 'beau', 'who', 'obviously', 'mama', 'boy', 'whom', 'Will', 'Varner', 'would', 'approve', 'stud', 'daughter', 'only', 'would', 'pop', 'question', 'young', 'men', 'seem', 'weak', 'compared', 'muscular', 'virile', 'tanned', 'Newman', 'Ben', 'Quick', 'Furthermore', 'why', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'unmarried', 'old', 'South', 'where', 'couples', 'ran', 'off', 'teens', 'what', 'father', 'would', 'bribe', 'account', 'barn-buring', 'drifter', 'wed', 'daughter', 'Again', 'Faulkner', 'probably', 'reveal', 'much', 'screen', 'play', 'misses.The', 'film', 'appeal', 'actors', 'are', 'beautiful', 'including', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'who', 'went', 'play', 'acclaimed', 'roles', 'drunken', 'and/or', 'crazy', 'wives', 'Angela', 'Landsbury', 'Jessica', 'Fletcher', 'wonderful', 'Minnie', 'long', 'suffering', 'mistress', 'Will', 'Varner', 'Based', 'price', 'good', 'buy', 'oldies', 'film', 'library', 'story', 'instructive', 'youngsters', 'who', 'wonder', 'fueled', 'youthful', 'rebellion', 'later', 'culminated', 'Women', 'Movement', 'late', '1950s']",Long Hot Summer VHS

The moment Paul Newman's Ben Quick, rebellious and irresistible drifter enters a rural Mississippi town of Frenchman's Bend to stir up its women, puzzle its men and to catch the interest of Big Daddy Varner (Orson Welles, the ferocious force of nature seemed to have fun playing Will Varner and experimenting with make-up) the town richest and most powerful redneck who perhaps sees in Ben a lot of himself, the screen legend was born.""The Long, Hot Summer"" (1958) is based on five short stories and a novel by one of the America's greatest novelists and storytellers, the expert of Southern life, William  Faulkner, and the film is a steamy, moving, often funny (perhaps, unintentionally) tale of lust, greed, jealousy, and larger than life personalities and their clashes. I guess I need to read more Faulkner's stories because I was surprised to see the film that is based on the works of the writer known for his heavy use of such sophisticated literary techniques as symbolism, allegory, and especially stream of consciousness, the film which linear narrative is easy to follow from the third person point-of-view.Besides Paul Newman who was as talented as he was hot, his off- screen wife-to-be Joanna Woodward shines as Clara  Varner, Will's intelligent, thinking daughter, the teacher in a local school whom her father wants to see married (and not just wants but takes certain steps that Clara does not like and feels offended by). The film was the first of many Newman's and Woodward's collaboration and it is not easy to recall the greater chemistry between two leads. Orson Welles dominates the screen in his every scene as expected. 21-years-old Lee Remick (Eula, Varner's daughter-in-law, sexy and innocent woman-child), Anthony Franciosa (Jody, Varner's overlooked and jealous son), and Angela Lansbury (Minnie, the woman who has her own plans about future that include a widower Varner in them) all add to the sizzling fun that ""The Long Hot Summer"" is.",4,"""Summertime, and the livin' is easy"" Or The Long, Hot Summer with Young Hot Paul Newman",1179964800,"05 24, 2007",2007,2082,"['was', 'time', 'when', 'called', 'young', 'new', 'star', 'was', 'breakthrough', 'stardom', 'fame', 'success', 'moment', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Ben', 'Quick', 'rebellious', 'irresistible', 'drifter', 'enters', 'rural', 'Mississippi', 'town', 'Frenchman', 'Bend', 'stir', 'up', 'women', 'puzzle', 'men', 'catch', 'interest', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Varner', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'ferocious', 'force', 'nature', 'seemed', 'have', 'fun', 'playing', 'Will', 'Varner', 'experimenting', 'make-up', 'town', 'richest', 'most', 'powerful', 'redneck', 'who', 'perhaps', 'Ben', 'lot', 'screen', 'legend', 'was', 'born', 'Long', 'Hot', 'Summer', '1958', 'based', 'five', 'short', 'stories', 'novel', 'one', 'America', 'greatest', 'novelists', 'storytellers', 'expert', 'Southern', 'life', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'film', 'steamy', 'moving', 'often', 'funny', 'perhaps', 'unintentionally', 'tale', 'lust', 'greed', 'jealousy', 'larger', 'life', 'personalities', 'clashes', 'guess', 'need', 'read', 'more', 'Faulkner', 'stories', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'film', 'based', 'works', 'writer', 'known', 'heavy', 'use', 'such', 'sophisticated', 'literary', 'techniques', 'symbolism', 'allegory', 'especially', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'film', 'linear', 'narrative', 'easy', 'follow', 'third', 'person', 'point-of-view.Besides', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'who', 'was', 'as', 'talented', 'was', 'hot', 'off-', 'screen', 'wife-to-be', 'Joanna', 'Woodward', 'Clara', 'Varner', 'Will', 'intelligent', 'thinking', 'daughter', 'teacher', 'local', 'school', 'whom', 'father', 'see', 'married', 'not', 'just', 'certain', 'steps', 'Clara', 'not', 'like', 'feels', 'offended', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'many', 'Newman', 'Woodward', 'collaboration', 'not', 'easy', 'recall', 'greater', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'screen', 'scene', 'expected', '21-years-old', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'Eula', 'Varner', 'daughter-in-law', 'sexy', 'innocent', 'woman-child', 'Anthony', 'Franciosa', 'Jody', 'Varner', 'overlooked', 'jealous', 'son', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'Minnie', 'woman', 'who', 'own', 'plans', 'future', 'include', 'widower', 'Varner', 'add', 'sizzling', 'fun', 'Long', 'Hot', 'Summer']",Long Hot Summer VHS

257386,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6301599225,Gregor von Kallahann,"[5, 9]","OK, this is the one everyone mixes up with &quot;Cat on A Hot Tin Roof.&quot; It's the Tennessee Williams movie that was really based on William Faulkner, but still FEELS like Tennessee Williams.  It's the one where the Burl Ives role was played by Orson Welles. But the Paul Newman part is still played by Paul Newman--which no doubt is one reason for the confusion.It's hard to imagine in 2001 how  revolutionary the (now) demure references Joanne Woodward makes to her decidedly repressed sexuality must have seemed in 1958.  And Lee Remick flouncing around in her slip and falling languidly into Tony Franciosa's eager arms must have seemed pretty racy at the time. (Of course, Lee and Tony had perfected the act in the previous year's &quot;Face In the Crowd.&quot;)  All of this seems pretty tepid nowadays. More's the pity, I guess.As a time capsule, the movie's priceless.  Dramatically, though, the pacing could have been lots better.  This was only director Martin Ritt's third theatrical effort.  Although he is known for getting good performances out of his actors, the script here lets him and the cast down.  Dramatic scenes (Jody's attempted murder of his overbearing father; the attempted lynching of Ben Quick by the enraged townsmen) seem rushed and are ultimately more ludicrous than moving.  Potentially affecting, the movie is more often frustrating.But as potboilers of the era go, &quot;Long Hot Summer&quot; remains a must see.  The chemistry between Woodward and Newman is evident in this, their first film together.  Remick continues her Southern belle shtick begun in &quot;Face in the Crowd&quot; (and that she'd revisit again in another Faulkner-based epic, &quot;Sanctuary&quot;)  in a way surprisingly winsome for a gal from Quincy, Mass.

It is amazing how sexy and erotic a movie can be without the lead characters running around naked. You can feel the sizzling electricity between Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward; but then, they weren't acting since they married soon after finishing this film. Although the movie is billed as ""William Faulkner's The Long Hot Summer"" and is based on some of his stories, I kept seeing and hearing shades of ""Cat On A Hot Tin Roof,"" which came out in the same year so I don't know who influenced whom if at all.Both Newman as the sexy drifter and Woodward, the school teacher who is 23 and still not married, are both so young and handsome and play off each other beautifully. The other actors give credible performances as well although Orson Welles is a little over the top at times. He certainly fills up the screen both in physical size and bombast. Angela Lansbury is charming as the local madam who provides pleasure for Welles who plays the rich landowner Varner. I don't know how true to Faulkner the plot is, not having read the stories in question, but something tells me the ending is distinctly not Faulknerian.Southern accents are always tricky; occasionally they don't ring true here with the exception of Woodward's; but she's a native Southerner after all.Set in Mississippi although shot in Louisiana, the film has an authentic feel and remains remarkably undated.

Welles' own son, Anthony Franciosa is weak, and he likes Newman and wants to match him up with his staid daughter Joanne Woodward, but she's not interested ... or at least not at first.  Newman's high wattage star charisma is on display here as the man who manages to get out of tight spots and can spot an opportunity when it is presented.

257405,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6301599225,Linda Linguvic,"[31, 31]","Adapted from some William Faulkner stories, this 1958 film certainly lives up to its name. It is &quot;hot&quot;. The setting is a small town in the Deep South and the characters familiar, but under the skillful direction of Martin Rich, they spring to life as complex, flawed and very human individuals. Paul Newman, in his prime then, is cast as Ben Quick, a young drifter who is taken under the wing of the town's patriarch, Will Varner, played by Orson Wells. Newman romances Varner's schoolteacher daughter, Clara, played by Joanne Woodward, and competes with Varner's son Jody, played by Anthony Franciosa, for the old man's respect and affection. Lee Remick is cast as Jody's pretty wife and Angela Lansbury plays Varner's lady friend. What a cast!Both Paul Newman and Orson Wells exude the essence of macho in the finest southern tradition. I can almost smell all that testosterone right off the video screen. There's nothing politically correct about this story, as the strength of the women lies only in the way they can manipulate the men in their lives. And, in spite of Joanne Woodward's, declaration of how much she loves books, the audience knows that what she really wants is nothing less than the kind of man who will make her wake up smiling each morning. This was the first movie that Woodward and Newman made together and they married shortly thereafter and so the audience is treated to a very special chemistry between them. Newman's blue eyes sparkle and his sexiness comes through loud and clear when he takes off his shirt. His body is naturally rugged without the sculptured pumped and ripped muscles that have since become trendy. Orson Wells' outstanding performance is the glue that holds the story together. He plays the role of the powerful 60-year old patriarch with exceptional vigor and is completely believable even though he was only 43 at the time. He wears his bulk well and there's sparkle between him and Angela Lansbury. During the course of the film, it is his character that goes through the most changes and he plays this with a naturalness that makes this believable.There's good writing, directing and close-up shots of the actors. And the story moved fast, holding my interest throughout. The camera also captured the distinctions between the dusty dirt farms and the luxurious mansion, but basically it focused on the people and the human drama. And the ending is a happy and satisfying one.

Teaming up with Joanne Woodward guarantees a good movie.Set in the deep South, where 100+ degrees are normal, Newman's character - Ben Quick - has a reputation for burning barns, all of which relates back to his father, his childhood and poverty. Orson Wells is marvelous as a wealthy landowner (owns most of the town) who wants  his daughter (Clara(Woodward) to get married and bring forth children. James Franciosa is the son married to Lee Remic who enjoys a life of privilege. Daddy thinks Ben Quick is a lot like him and would make Clara very happy, but Clara doesn't see it that way, so the pursuit begins. How Clara could resist him next to the namby-pamby boyfriend makes the chase even better. A favorite line from Lee Remic to Franciosa, because he's always chasing her to the bedroom, &#34;I sure do wish you would find yourself some other form of recreation!&#34; Orson Wells does a good job in this lighter story vs the dark, serious movies he has made.

It is nothing less than one of the best and sexiest southern fried dramas from the 1950's. This adaptation of several works of William Faulkner is a tour de force for everyone involved. How lucky are we to have two great films on southern family life starring Paul Newman come out in 1958? This film is a fine companion piece to ""Cat On A Hot Tin Roof"", a bit more upbeat than ""Cat""  but still full of sound and fury.As Ben Quick, Paul Newman ignites the screen and fairly burns down half of Mississippi in the process with his incredible magnetism. He brings to Quick all he as to bear as an actor and creates one of his early memorable performances.  Just watch him as bare chested he hugs his pillow on the hot veranda while watching Joanne Woodward through a screen door sitting up in her bed trying to ignore him, or his walk across the Varner yard early on in the film, his interactions with Orson Wells or Tony Franciosa. He is every inch the ""mean and dirty"" barnburner everyone thinks he is. He is just what the Varner family and Clara Varner in particular need to feed their respective fever dreams brought on by the heat of this particular August in the south.Hitting her marks in a great performance is Joanne Woodward. She being a true daughter of the South comes to the table with and extra barrel loaded. As Clara Varner she is both needy and steely, a magnolia ready to be plucked but at that same time fearful that she will be passed over and left to wither on the vine. Her scene in the general store after closing time with Newman is just about one of the steamiest love scenes ever filmed thisside of ""Picnic"".  Miss Woodward here in this film is pure magic to watch and in combination with Paul Newman the pair become an alchemy of fireworks and lightning bugs on a summers night.Adding to the fine cast is Lee Remick, Tony Franciosa, the incredible Angela Lansbury and the equally and always impressive Orson Wells. I would go on about each of them but I think it best to let them surprise you. That's half the fun of the film.The score by Alex North is memorable and one of his best. The cinematography by Joseph LeShelle captures the hazy heat of Mississippi. And Martin Ritt's direction of all parties concerned is perfectly on target. Be sure to check some of his other collaborations with Newman, ""Paris Blues"", ""Hud"" to mention only two.Pour yourself a tall sweet tea, kick off your shoes and open the veranda doors and let the breeze of this long hot summer envelope you.",5,Southern Fried Masterpiece,1121990400,"07 22, 2005",2005,2532,"['Well', 'now', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'here', 'nothing', 'less', 'one', 'best', 'sexiest', 'southern', 'fried', 'dramas', '1950', 'adaptation', 'several', 'works', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'everyone', 'involved', 'How', 'lucky', 'are', 'have', 'two', 'great', 'films', 'southern', 'family', 'life', 'starring', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'come', 'out', '1958', 'film', 'fine', 'companion', 'piece', 'Cat', 'A', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', 'bit', 'more', 'upbeat', 'Cat', 'still', 'full', 'sound', 'fury.As', 'Ben', 'Quick', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'screen', 'fairly', 'burns', 'down', 'half', 'Mississippi', 'process', 'incredible', 'magnetism', 'Quick', 'bear', 'actor', 'one', 'early', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Just', 'watch', 'bare', 'chested', 'hugs', 'pillow', 'hot', 'veranda', 'watching', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'screen', 'door', 'sitting', 'up', 'bed', 'trying', 'ignore', 'walk', 'Varner', 'yard', 'early', 'film', 'interactions', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'Tony', 'Franciosa', 'inch', 'mean', 'dirty', 'barnburner', 'everyone', 'just', 'what', 'Varner', 'family', 'Clara', 'Varner', 'particular', 'need', 'feed', 'respective', 'fever', 'dreams', 'brought', 'heat', 'particular', 'August', 'south.Hitting', 'marks', 'great', 'performance', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'being', 'true', 'daughter', 'South', 'table', 'extra', 'barrel', 'loaded', 'Clara', 'Varner', 'needy', 'steely', 'magnolia', 'ready', 'be', 'plucked', 'same', 'time', 'fearful', 'will', 'be', 'passed', 'left', 'wither', 'vine', 'scene', 'general', 'store', 'closing', 'time', 'Newman', 'just', 'one', 'steamiest', 'love', 'scenes', 'ever', 'filmed', 'thisside', 'Picnic', 'Miss', 'Woodward', 'here', 'film', 'pure', 'magic', 'watch', 'combination', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'pair', 'become', 'alchemy', 'fireworks', 'lightning', 'bugs', 'summers', 'night.Adding', 'fine', 'cast', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'Tony', 'Franciosa', 'incredible', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'equally', 'always', 'impressive', 'Orson', 'Wells', 'would', 'go', 'think', 'best', 'let', 'surprise', 'fun', 'film.The', 'score', 'Alex', 'North', 'memorable', 'one', 'best', 'cinematography', 'Joseph', 'LeShelle', 'hazy', 'heat', 'Mississippi', 'Martin', 'Ritt', 'direction', 'parties', 'concerned', 'perfectly', 'target', 'Be', 'sure', 'check', 'other', 'collaborations', 'Newman', 'Paris', 'Blues', 'Hud', 'mention', 'only', 'two.Pour', 'tall', 'sweet', 'tea', 'kick', 'off', 'shoes', 'open', 'veranda', 'doors', 'let', 'breeze', 'long', 'hot', 'summer', 'envelope']",Long Hot Summer VHS

257411,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,6301599225,Muzzlehatch,"[1, 1]","I haven't read the William Faulkner novel ""The Hamlet"", nor the other short stories from which this film was adapted, but I'd have to guess from what I know of the author's other works that it's a pretty loose rendition.  Oh, the basic, typical Faulkner elements are here: the once-proud but now decaying family, the patriarch concerned about propagating his heritage into the future, the suspicions of strangers that come into the settled town and change things, the carnality and sexuality of women, the repression of desires by both sexes.  But on the whole this is ""lighter"" and more optimistic-feeling than any work of the writer that I've read, and it certainly strikes me as unlikely that the novel - published in 1940 - is as full of humor, and short on gothic misery, as the film.  I guess I'll have to read it and find out...All that's by way of saying that this ain't a film you need to go into worrying about Faulknerian heaviness.  Even the florid, over-the-top character of Will Varner (Orson Welles at his most charismatic and unstoppable), who dominates the small town of Frenchman's Bend through generosity and a gregarious nature as much as, or perhaps more than through the usual threats and intimidations - even he is as much a comic figure as anything.  And pairing the force of nature Welles with the young Paul Newman as Ben Quick, ne'er do-well drifter who's looking for a piece of the Varner financial pie - and the Varner daughter Clara (Joanne Woodward) results not in a clash of egos and styles (at least not onscreen) but rather a contest of similar florid, scenery-chewing actors who seem to be having a good ol' time.  And much of that, thankfully, translates into a good ol' time for us in the audience as well.The basic storyline here is that Quick - run out of one town for supposed barn-burning - hitches a ride on a barge and ends up in this backwater Mississippi town, making the acquaintance of a couple of the town's young lovelies in the forms of Clara and her sister-in-law Eula (Lee Remick).  Eula is married to Jody (Anthony Franciosa), Clara's older brother, a weak-willed and possibly impotent (it's only hinted at here) young man who seems incapable of pleasing his blustery father Will.  Clara has been in a long-running semi-courtship with another weak man, Alan Stewart (Richard Anderson) who is sickly and under the thumb of a domineering mother - so the Alpha-male Quick is speedily sized up and found suitable as potential mating material for his spinster daughter by old Will, who throws himself around with even more weight than Welles was packing when the film was made (and that's saying something).But as I said, it's not entirely Faulknerian Southern Gothic in style, perhaps closer to a mild Peyton Place atmosphere, maybe crossed with some ""Hud""-era Larry McMurtry.  And that's OK, because the actors all have fun with it, the location work is nice, and the whole thing does convey at least a little bit of the sense of the land and people and history that were the writer's life's work - even if only Woodward among the members of the principal cast was actually southern.  I think she fares the best overall, regardless of her more realistic accent, getting pretty well the mixture of feelings that this smart, educated young woman has about being potentially pushed into a life where her abilities and talents won't be appreciated.  Newman certainly has the charisma and charm for Ben Quick, but the darker and harder aspects of the character aren't opened up enough by screewriters Irving Ravitch and Harriet Frank for him to get as much juice out of it as he might.  Remick doesn't have much to do but look pretty - which she does spectacularly well; Franciosa is playing a fairly stereotypical pathetic-son-trying-to-please-daddy but he carries it off nicely, always believably insecure around Welles and belligerent around Newman.  Which leaves us with The Great Man, Orson the Magnificent who is...well, he's Orson.  Hammy and showing off and dominating, I have no idea if this is the way the character was written but he's larger than life and full of energy, raging and laughing, yelling and joking.  Half the time he's very hard to understand - and that's AFTER much of his part was post-dubbed (for that matter a large chunk of the film was looped, not just Welles' role).  Talking a mile a minute, slurring his voice, changing his pitch - supposedly tricks to infuriate director Ritt, according to some sources.  Well, maybe - but however much truth there is to that, he's magnetic and if he doesn't seem any more like he's from Mississippi than any of the rest of the cast, it does feel at times like he understands the Gothic, overdramatic nature of it all like no one else does.In short, it's not quite Faulkner - not quite ""real"" - not quite a perfectly worked-out piece of narrative - but it's compulsively watchable thanks to the powerful cast, who may not have been making a masterpiece but who were clearly under a spell of some kind, and doing what Hollywood in those days did best - taking us out of our mundane world filled with mundane people, and bringing us to a land of larger-than-life characters, some of whom at least sure seem like they'd be fun to share a cold beer with, on a hot Mississippi summer afternoon.The DVD looks fine, the colors bright and full of heat; the extras aren't substantial though there is a half-hour ""making"" of piece that was originally on TV and isn't

257415,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,6301599225,Nix Pix,"[30, 35]","""The Long Hot Summer"" was (for its time)a steamy study of sexual repression and sensual misbehavior.  It starred Paul Newman as a drifter accused of barn burning who sets up house-keeping with the daughter (Joanne Woodward) of a rich plantation owner (Orson Welles).  The on screen chemistry is certainly there and why not.  This film just happened to be the catalyst for the real life romance between Newman and Woodward.  Contextualizing the fact that the censors still reigned supreme during the time of its production, ""The Long Hot Summer"" still proved to be a smoldering, sexy drama fraught with tension and chaos.THE TRANSFER: Fox has done a particularly nice job on remastering this movie.  Yes, the flicker of scene changes (inherant in all early Cinemascope films)remains present and yes, color consistancy leaves something to be desired.  But over all, colors are nicely balanced, if showing slight fading.  Contrast and shadow levels are well represented.  Pixelization, shimmering and edge enhancement, though all present, are kept to a bare minimum.  The audio is Stereo surround and, even though considerably dated, still manages to have a hearty kick in all of the speakers.EXTRAS: Very nice - the Backstory featurette that details the production of the film, a Paul Newman gallery, original movietone snippet and the film's theatrical trailer.BOTTOM LINE: This is a nice presentation and a pretty good film besides.

257423,A1MIFU0YKLG40T,6301599225,Rick Galati,"[2, 3]","I rated this film with four stars though on most measurable levels, it is worthy of maybe three. The screenplay as written is a montage, (some say mish-mash) of William Faulkner's literary works. Still, the film works..... most of the time. Jerry Wald's production has 1950's sensibilities written all over it. A real strength of this film lies in the charismatic on-screen performance of young Paul Newman's Ben Quick and his incendiary relationship with Orson Welles' Will Varner. It is said the editing room had to re-do much of Welles' dialogue to make it intelligible for the audience. Whatever. I am fascinated by virtually every word uttered in Welles' quirky interpretation of a portly, gravelly voiced redneck hell-bent to leave his greasy thumbprint on all who would come under his influence. For 62 year old Varner to race about town in a Jeep as his personal conveyance of choice completes the picture of a man unbowed in the presence of all others. Eager to marry his daughter off to perpetuate his legacy, Will encouraged Ben anyway he could. In all things, he could be demanding and callous, yet in a rare display of affection, Will uncharacteristically and tenderly explained to his sensitive daughter Clara, (Joanne Woodward) ""Sometimes the strong just rolls over the weak."" Angela Lansbury played Minnie LittleJohn, a retired women of the evening. As an inevitable consequence of age, her world weariness and palpable sense of urgency that time was running out expedited a patient and sincere pursuit of Will for his hand in marriage. Richard Anderson portrayed Alan Stewart, Clara's long-time supposed suitor, an elegant, tasteful and honorable southern gentleman. Outed by an impatient Varner, and forced to declare his sexual orientation, he had to finally declare his unsuitability for Clara's hand in marriage. To me, the one miscast major actor in this film was Anthony Franciosa as Will's disaffected son, Jody. It was difficult for me to accept a dark and somewhat ethic Franciosa as a privileged son of the deep south, though Lee Remick positively shined as his highly desirable sexually charged wife Eula. The obvious on-screen chemistry shared of Newman and Woodward in ""The Long, Hot Summer"" is the stuff of Hollywood legend. Those were real sparks of passion arcing between them, the camera just documented the fireworks for posterity. Their highly charged scenes make the price of admission all the more reasonable and justification enough for me to rate this film with 4 stars.",4,Steam Heat,1066089600,"10 14, 2003",2003,2510,"['rated', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'most', 'measurable', 'levels', 'worthy', 'maybe', 'three', 'screenplay', 'written', 'montage', 'say', 'mish-mash', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'literary', 'works', 'Still', 'film', 'works', 'most', 'time', 'Jerry', 'Wald', 'production', '1950', 'sensibilities', 'written', 'real', 'strength', 'film', 'charismatic', 'on-screen', 'performance', 'young', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Ben', 'Quick', 'incendiary', 'relationship', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Will', 'Varner', 'said', 'editing', 'room', 'had', 're-do', 'much', 'Welles', 'dialogue', 'make', 'intelligible', 'audience', 'am', 'fascinated', 'virtually', 'word', 'uttered', 'Welles', 'quirky', 'interpretation', 'portly', 'gravelly', 'voiced', 'redneck', 'hell-bent', 'leave', 'greasy', 'thumbprint', 'who', 'would', 'come', 'influence', '62', 'year', 'old', 'Varner', 'race', 'town', 'Jeep', 'personal', 'conveyance', 'choice', 'picture', 'man', 'unbowed', 'presence', 'others', 'Eager', 'marry', 'daughter', 'perpetuate', 'legacy', 'Will', 'encouraged', 'Ben', 'anyway', 'could', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'demanding', 'callous', 'yet', 'rare', 'display', 'affection', 'Will', 'uncharacteristically', 'tenderly', 'explained', 'sensitive', 'daughter', 'Clara', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'Sometimes', 'strong', 'just', 'rolls', 'weak', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'played', 'Minnie', 'LittleJohn', 'retired', 'women', 'evening', 'inevitable', 'consequence', 'age', 'world', 'weariness', 'palpable', 'sense', 'urgency', 'time', 'was', 'running', 'out', 'expedited', 'patient', 'sincere', 'pursuit', 'Will', 'hand', 'marriage', 'Richard', 'Anderson', 'portrayed', 'Alan', 'Stewart', 'Clara', 'long-time', 'supposed', 'suitor', 'elegant', 'tasteful', 'honorable', 'southern', 'gentleman', 'Outed', 'impatient', 'Varner', 'forced', 'declare', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'had', 'finally', 'declare', 'unsuitability', 'Clara', 'hand', 'marriage', 'one', 'miscast', 'major', 'actor', 'film', 'was', 'Anthony', 'Franciosa', 'Will', 'disaffected', 'son', 'Jody', 'was', 'difficult', 'accept', 'dark', 'somewhat', 'ethic', 'Franciosa', 'privileged', 'son', 'deep', 'south', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'positively', 'shined', 'highly', 'desirable', 'sexually', 'charged', 'wife', 'Eula', 'obvious', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'shared', 'Newman', 'Woodward', 'Long', 'Hot', 'Summer', 'stuff', 'Hollywood', 'legend', 'were', 'real', 'sparks', 'passion', 'arcing', 'camera', 'just', 'documented', 'fireworks', 'posterity', 'highly', 'charged', 'scenes', 'make', 'price', 'admission', 'more', 'reasonable', 'justification', 'enough', 'rate', 'film', '4', 'stars']",Long Hot Summer VHS
257424,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,6301599225,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[5, 7]","""The Long, Hot Summer,"" the first of six films he made for director Martin Ritt and the first of seven co-starring Joanne Woodward, is based on two short stories and part of a novel by Faulkner, provided him with his best role to that time...Ben Quick (Newman), a foolhardy, opportunistic young wanderer, drifts into a Mississippi town owned and run by the huge, powerful Will Varner (Orson Welles), who also dominates his daughter Clara (Woodward), a 23-year-o1d unmarried schoolteacher... Despite Quick's reputation as a ""barnburner,"" he is hired by Varner, and rapid1y works his way up to a partnership in the general store and a room in the main house...Varner, like Big Daddy in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"" wants strong descendants, and since his son is a weakling, he decides that Clara will marry Quick, whose aggressive masculinity he admires (he calls Quick a ""big stud horse""). Clara, offended by Quick's very self-satisfaction and vulgar manner, and by both men's treating her as property, resists...Like Billy the Kid, Quick is an outcast, isolated from humanity because of his notorious reputation... But in temperament he's the opposite, an extreme extrovert... From the very beginning, Newman, hat down low over his forehead, eyes gleaming with ambition, projects an overwhelming confidence, self-satisfaction and, above all, electrifying virility... Cynical, arrogant, crude and unwilling to allow anything to interfere with his drive, he resembles Larry Maddux of ""The Helen Morgan Story."" But now the portrayal is more than one-dimensional: behind Quick's hard blue eyes, barely hidden sneer and devilish smile there's enough intelligence, humor, charm, and downright attractiveness to force our involvement in his quest for power...This is due entirely to Newman's ingenious acting, because as written the character reveals no positive traits until near the end, when he breaks down and tells Clara the truth about himself... It's a powerful scene: his voice breaking, eyes filling slow1y with tears, Newman effectively depicts a man whose carefully formed cold shell is finally cracking to reveal the vulnerable soul within...The confession gives him a bond of equality with Clara that enables him to stand up decisively to Varner... But even earlier, Quick was never completely dominated by the old man... Of all the father-figures in Newman's films, Varner seems the most imposing, but Quick, unlike the weakling sons in ""The Rack"" and ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"" isn't passive enough to be stepped upon...William Faulkner's characters are perfect foils: Newman is sexually sure, and seemingly devoid of vulnerability and humanity; Woodward is a virgin, extremely vulnerable, and longing to express her humanity... She teaches him humility and the value of an individual; he helps her discover her sexuality...Two scenes are among the best in their careers, partly because of the sharp dialog by the screenwriters... In the first, Clara comes to see Ben in the store at night... After much childish verbal attacks and a few unperceptive truths, the two have pierced beneath the surface and have found the nerve endings of each other's weaknesses...Later, in the film's finest scene, Clara expresses herself more maturely, asserting that he has the wrong idea about her: she is no ""trembling little rabbit, full of smoldering unsatisfied desires,"" but a full-grown, intelligent woman, who will not be bought and sold...

Orson Wells, Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward (whom Newman would marry after meeting her on the set of this film), Angela Lansbury, Lee Remick, and Anthony Franciosa.  The film, based on William Faulkner's work, is set in the deep south, during a, well, long hot summer.  Everyone is sweating in the film, giving it an air of authenticity.  (And this is before global warming!)Newman plays Ben Quick, who arrives in town after being accused of a barn burning, supposedly in revenge, in another town.  He quickly latches on to the richest family in the colorfully named Mississippi town, Frenchman's Bend.  Quick is apparently the energetic and ambitious son that Will Varner always hoped for.  Varner's own son, Jody, is thought by the patrician of the family to lack ambition and drive.Woodward plays Will's headstrong daughter Clara.  She gives an excellent performance, and once you watch the film, you'll understand what attracted Newman.  Lansbury also gives a great performance, shedding her English accent for a Southern Accent.  Remick has a lesser role, but looks stunning doing it.Strongly recommended.  This is a great film, based on that great Southern writer, Faulkner.  Just to watch the acting is a treat in itself.
