1274947,A3GCCPW2JO04KK,B002KLA9B2,Bob,"[13, 13]","I follow aviation closely, and this DVD still had many things I did not know.The segment on the US Airways landing on the Hudson river is good, although it does not have enough of the amazing Captain Sully. However, like the rest of the DVD, this segment tells you something you never knew: Sully and his co-pilot made a major screw-up: they forgot to engage the Airbus ""Ditch"" switch, which contributed to the faster-than-normal sinking of the plane after it pancaked on the river. You didn't know that, did you? Me, neither.The other two segments on famous air crashes and the safety improvements that resulted from them are even better. All these crashes are well-known to aviation enthusiasts, but the resulting safety improvements were mostly unknown to me. And...Did you know that there is a runway over-run in the United States an average of every 10 days? And that such over-runs account for 25% of all aviation fatalities? No, you didn't know that. Neither did I.All in all, an excellent DVD value.",4,stuff you never knew,1264204800,"01 23, 2010",2010,1007,"['follow', 'aviation', 'closely', 'DVD', 'still', 'had', 'many', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'know.The', 'segment', 'US', 'Airways', 'landing', 'Hudson', 'river', 'good', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'amazing', 'Captain', 'Sully', 'However', 'rest', 'DVD', 'segment', 'something', 'never', 'knew', 'Sully', 'co-pilot', 'made', 'major', 'screw-up', 'forgot', 'engage', 'Airbus', 'Ditch', 'switch', 'contributed', 'faster-than-normal', 'sinking', 'plane', 'pancaked', 'river', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', 'Me', 'neither.The', 'other', 'two', 'segments', 'famous', 'air', 'crashes', 'safety', 'improvements', 'resulted', 'are', 'even', 'better', 'crashes', 'are', 'well-known', 'aviation', 'enthusiasts', 'resulting', 'safety', 'improvements', 'were', 'mostly', 'unknown', 'Did', 'know', 'runway', 'over-run', 'United', 'States', 'average', '10', 'days', 'such', 'over-runs', 'account', '25', '%', 'aviation', 'fatalities', 'No', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', 'I.All', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'value']",N/A

The first part is a documentary about the US Airways A320 ditching on the Hudson river in january 2009. It includes computer animations, passengers testimonies and great unseen footage of the accident and the rescue as well as an interview with Cpt Sullenberger. If the DVD was solely composed of this documentary, it'd be already a must have.
