772498,A3MQ3IIFGLQ2PO,B0000C24GG,E. Hornaday,"[129, 129]","Quite simply, one of the best BBC Classic TV Miniseries ever produced. Filmed in 1978 and to be released in a four-disc DVD set, the miniseries stars the brilliant Francesca Annis (Tommy and Tuppence, etc.) as Lillie Langtry, one of the most famous and infamous courtesans/ladies of the Victorian age.In an era when women were to be seen and not heard, the unforgettable Lillie broke every taboo without a backward glance. The series chronicles her long life, and in so doing presents one of the best portraits of Victorian England ever filmed.We watch Lillie as a young tomboy, grow to an awkward adolescent, a stunning woman, and a beautiful old woman. Each stage of her life is portrayed perfectly by Annis, the makeup transforming her body while her awesome talent transforms her character development as Lillie.Lillie is one-of-a-kind, a calculating woman of immense presence, grace and substance. Unfortunately, she becomes trapped in a loveless marriage, but she devises her own way to cope.Taking full advantage of her beauty, Lillie deliberately attracts as many as a dozen lovers and admirers including the married Prince of Wales and notorious Oscar Wilde.As her husband slowly drinks himself to death, she relies on her looks, wiles and self-assurance in the London Society of the 1870s to embark upon a sensational career as a marginally talented actress.With guile, Lillie creates a truly unique life of the courtesan, eventually gaining prestige by going on the stage and touring America many times over.Throughout her life she endures financial ruin and scandal, yet maintains her celebrated lifestyle. Because Lillie lives to be a very old woman, viewers are given an honest glimpse of the Victoria Era through the span of her life.As with every BBC miniseries dealing with period stories, the acting, staging, filming and music is all well above top notch.",5,Flawless,1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,1874,"['Quite', 'simply', 'one', 'best', 'BBC', 'Classic', 'TV', 'Miniseries', 'ever', 'produced', 'Filmed', '1978', 'be', 'released', 'four-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'miniseries', 'brilliant', 'Francesca', 'Annis', 'Tommy', 'Tuppence', 'etc', 'Lillie', 'Langtry', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'infamous', 'courtesans/ladies', 'Victorian', 'age.In', 'era', 'when', 'women', 'were', 'be', 'seen', 'not', 'heard', 'unforgettable', 'Lillie', 'broke', 'taboo', 'backward', 'glance', 'series', 'long', 'life', 'so', 'doing', 'presents', 'one', 'best', 'portraits', 'Victorian', 'England', 'ever', 'filmed.We', 'watch', 'Lillie', 'young', 'tomboy', 'grow', 'awkward', 'adolescent', 'stunning', 'woman', 'beautiful', 'old', 'woman', 'stage', 'life', 'portrayed', 'perfectly', 'Annis', 'makeup', 'transforming', 'body', 'awesome', 'talent', 'character', 'development', 'Lillie.Lillie', 'one-of-a-kind', 'calculating', 'woman', 'immense', 'presence', 'grace', 'substance', 'Unfortunately', 'trapped', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'own', 'way', 'cope.Taking', 'full', 'advantage', 'beauty', 'Lillie', 'deliberately', 'as', 'many', 'dozen', 'lovers', 'admirers', 'including', 'married', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'notorious', 'Oscar', 'Wilde.As', 'husband', 'slowly', 'death', 'looks', 'wiles', 'self-assurance', 'London', 'Society', '1870s', 'embark', 'sensational', 'career', 'marginally', 'talented', 'actress.With', 'guile', 'Lillie', 'truly', 'unique', 'life', 'courtesan', 'eventually', 'gaining', 'prestige', 'going', 'stage', 'touring', 'America', 'many', 'times', 'life', 'financial', 'ruin', 'scandal', 'yet', 'celebrated', 'lifestyle', 'Lillie', 'be', 'very', 'old', 'woman', 'viewers', 'are', 'given', 'honest', 'glimpse', 'Victoria', 'Era', 'span', 'life.As', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'dealing', 'period', 'stories', 'acting', 'staging', 'filming', 'music', 'well', 'top', 'notch']",N/A

Behrens ""Frank Behrens""","[35, 35]","""Masterpiece Theatre"" was originally designed to show dramatized versions of great classics or of historical periods from England's past. ""The First Churchills"" led the way and many a great adaptation of a novel or a biography has followed. (Alas, a lot of junk was soon considered ""masterpieces"" and the glory of the series faded.) Among the best of them was the 13-part miniseries titled ""Lillie,"" and it is now available in a boxed set of Acorn Media DVDs. Grab it!Part of the plot of the 1940 film ""The Westerner"" is concerned with Judge Roy Bean's infatuation with an English actress named Lillie Langtry. That character shows up in ""Lillie"" just once but memorably, but the scene does raise the question of how just another pretty face could so become the rage of England and America without its owner having any other particular talents (they say her acting was amateurish at best)--except an iron will to get what she wants and a high degree of intelligence.As played by Francesca Annis, whose own good looks make the story believable, Lillie suffers an early disillusionment when she marries Mr. Langtry (brilliantly played by  Anton Rodgers) because he is a ""gentleman"" (= an utterly useless person) with a yacht. Then she quickly realizes he has far less fortune than she thought and even less understanding of how a wife should be treated (after their wedding night, he spends the rest of the day in town). In the years that follow, although she becomes the mistress of the Prince of Wales (Denis Lill) and of several other men, Langtry doggedly refuses a divorce--and his end is possibly just what he deserves or rather a bit more than he deserves. The very fact that I wonder about this shows how deeply I felt for these characters as I again watched this 672-minute miniseries, which was first shown on American public television in 1979.Actually, my fondest memories of ""Lillie"" are of the unforgettable Oscar Wilde of Peter Egan. Having seen Robert Morley, Peter Finch and others play the role, I have to call Egan's Wilde the very best. If one views only those scenes in which he appears, the price of the set would still be worth it.The cast list on the Internet Movie Database runs for seven pages, and I refer my readers to that website. I ran off a copy and kept it near my chair to identify familiar faces along the way, one of which was that of Jennie Linden who portrays Lillie's closest friend, Patsy Cornwallis-West.I will be replaying this one over the years to come.

It depicts the story of Lillie Langtry, the Jersey Lily, most famous beauty of the age.  Francesca Annis was born to play the part, with her flawless complexion and beautiful hair evoking Langtry at her magnificent peak.  The series traces Lillie's life from girlhood on the island of Jersey, when she was already a beauty, through her unfortunate marriage to Edward Langtry, a weak man whose dissipations destroyed him, to her days as a Professional Beauty in London Society and mistress to the Prince of Wales.  If the series stopped there it would be enjoyable enough, but the story gains additional depth by going on to depict Lillie as an actress in Britain and America, showing her to have been a sharp businesswoman.  The final episodes show her in decline and end with her literal last few breaths.  Throughout the series we see not only Lillie's career but those of many other important artists, politicians, and royals, ranging from King Edward VII through Oscar Wilde all the way to William Gladstone.

Lillie Langtry later became an actress but from what little else I know about her, she couldn't hold a candle to Sarah Bernhardt or Lillian Russell.The people who deserved her kindness and consideration didn't get it and the ones who weren't deserving of it did.  She sold her soul for jewelry, beautiful clothes, property, race horses, houses and the most intoxicating of all, social standing.  In order to continue to receive expensive jewelry from one of her many lovers, she would willingly take a beating so violent that she had to be hospitalized.  Her husband, Edward Langtry, played stunningly well by Anton Rogers, although a buffoon who lost his fortune shortly after their marriage, died alone in an asylum due to alcoholism.  Rather than consider his feelings of being overshadowed by her popularity and adultery w/the Prince of Wales (Bertie), she chose to buy him off by sending him a small amount of money each month until his death.  Oscar Wilde, the poet and playwright, played to perfection by Peter Egan, hardly worthy of the attention that she fawned on him, was taken care of by Lillie after his bankruptcy 'til the day he died.  Even her own father, a minister who was disgraced and forced to leave his church due to misconduct w/women, didn't receive any help from Lillie.  She'd say that ""it's about time that I do something for him"" but she never did.  Lillie grew up w/6 brothers and I feel that contributed to her attitude towards men, that they're to be used and cast aside when finished w/them.  I think she felt that her father deserved what he got as did her husband and that she'd make herself look good in the eyes of others but would do as little as possible to help them.  As a result of her reckless and thoughtless behavior throughout her life, her illegitimate daughter born to the Prince of Austria, was passed off as her niece who later learned her true parentage and did not speak to her mother again until just before Lillie's own passing.  Lillie never got to enjoy her daughter or grandchildren due to her own disregard for the feelings and lives of others.  She died alone and forgotten, a sad but just ending to a woman who cared for no one but herself.Francesca Annis played the part of Lillie and although others have given her rave reviews, I feel that each part Annis plays is the same flat portrayal w/only a name change.  Compare her acting in Madame Bovary and you'll see what I mean.  She was a stunning beauty in her day so she may have been cast w/that reason uppermost.

It holds up, despite the years since its' release, due in large part by the magnificent cast, lavish sets, and strength of Ms. Annis' stunning performance. I cannot recommend this highly enough! I rated it a four only because of the strange age makeup they used on Ms. Annis, which does not hold up to the rigors of HDTV and seems to change from frighteningly plastic, to ghost white, to almost normal. The serious lack of any real extra bonus features is also a minus. I could not stop watching this until I had viewed the entire series again.

This is the story - told in about 12 episodes - of the life of Lillie Langtry who began her notorious adult life as the mistress of the Prince of Wales (later he became King Edward VII).  During that time she also was the muse to artists John Everett Millais, Edward Poynter, Edward Burne-Jones and Frank Miles. When that affair ended, she became a very well-known actress.  Unfortunately, she wasn't all that good but people came to see her perform because of her notoriety.  The word we'd use for Lillie nowadays is a tramp - she used men and slept with them and in return she received access to more rich and powerful men and also plenty of money and jewelry.  She lived a relatively long life, had a daughter and died alone in Monte Carlo.If you enjoy period English drama, love seeing the beautiful costumes, and want to get enveloped into the delicious, fabulous, tawdry, decadent, funny, sad life of a woman who reinvented herself more than once and survived the times, this is the DVD for you.Francesa Annis is so beautiful and is truly a wonderful actress -- it was a pleasure to look at her.

772519,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B0000C24GG,Stephanie De Pue,"[8, 8]","""Lillie,"" a half-forgotten classic from the golden age of the British television miniseries, that starred Francesca Annis as Lillie Langtry, a turn of the 20th century society beauty - professional beauty, as they called them, although they weren't supposed to be professional at all,finally reaches these shores.  The DVD has been remastered from its TV incarnation, however, as the series is rather old, having first appeared on American TV in 1979, there are a few odd moments that resisted clarification.  But the production, by Granada for London Weekend Television, is at least as sumptuous as any treatment of the material by the British Broadcasting Corporation might have been.  The costumes and carriages are accurate; filming was done on location; and the thirteen episode entertainment utilizes a cast of over 1,000, including live musicians at the numerous balls.The drama traces the rise of the beauteous Jersey clergyman's daughter, through London society - where she caught a number of royal eyes--to become one of the first famous, independent - and infamous - women of the twentieth century.  The gorgeous Annis, who was a British TV star from her teenage years, carries the production in a BAFTA(the British Oscar)winning performance, appearing in most scenes, from youth to old age.  She may be best remembered here from the 1997 British TV series ""Reckless,"" but she's actually played Langtry twice, as well as playing Madame Bovary, and Jackie Kennedy Onassis, for British TV.  She is ably assisted here by Peter Egan as Oscar Wilde; Anton Rodgers as her first husband, Edward Langtry; and Denis Lill, playing the Prince of Wales, to briefly sit the English throne as Edward VII.  Each of these men show up on several episodes, must age along with the star, and have dramatic character arcs.  Jennie Linden also does well as Langtry's close friend, Mrs. Patsy Cornwallis-West.Lillie was first taken up by London society for her extraordinary beauty, and was painted by James Whistler and John Everett Millais, among others.  She was lionized by Wilde, Walt Whitman, George Bernard Shaw, and Judge Roy Bean of Texas, who, as viewers who remember an old Paul Newman movie will know, named his town ""Langtry,"" after her.She scandalized London society by a string of affairs with royals: Prince Edward, who was called Bertie - while she always remained on good terms with his wife Alexandra -- and Prince Louis of Battenberg, among others; and turned down Leopold of Belgium and Price Rudolf of Austria (who was, famously, later to kill himself and his mistress at Mayerling).  She was also collecting spectacular jewels all the way.  But she still needed more money.  So she was the first `professional beauty' to pose for paid celebrity endorsements.  And she went into business for herself, buying numerous properties; meanwhile she had to pay the alcoholic Langtry, who refused to give her a divorce, to keep his distance.  She went on the stage, becoming an immensely popular actress, if not one of the most prestigious,and toured America many times.  She had her own racing stable.Lillie bore one daughter, illegitimately, to Prince Louis of Battenberg.  He unfortunately was a cousin of the Royal Family, and a career naval officer.  The Prince of Wales did not think it advisable to let him marry Lillie; so she was forced to have her daughter in secret, and misrepresent the girl to herself, and the disapproving world.  Whether because of resentment at this treatment, or simply as a result of the pendulum of character's swinging from one generation to the next, the daughter, Jeanne Marie, appears to have grown up an extremely conventional woman.  She refused to see her mother for nigh on twenty years; nor would she let the woman know her grandchildren.  There can be no doubt that Jeanne Marie caused her mother great pain: as Shakespeare says in ""King Lear,"" ""How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child.""Meanwhile, Price Louis, the girl's father, was to rise very high indeed in the British Navy, to Admiralty rank.  But anti-German prejudice in World War I forced him to resign.  However, his youngest son by the German princess whom he married would also have a highly-successful naval career.  Lord Louis Mountbatten would be given many titles and honors; he was a friend of the royal family's, as well as a relation.  He was also an uncle to Prince Philip, the current-day consort of Queen Elizabeth II, and was instrumental in making that marriage.  He was an outstanding figure; so much so, unhappily, that he was assassinated by the Irish Republican Army at the age of 79.The series is quite engrossing, a seductive telling of the life of a famed seductress.  A series of thirteen episodes requires more of a commitment than perhaps we are accustomed to make today (some of us may wonder how we ever did it back then); but its length allows the viewer to immerse him- or herself in an immensely pleasurable experience.",5,A Seductive Life of a Famed Seductress,1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,4984,"['Lillie', 'half-forgotten', 'classic', 'golden', 'age',

As far as the series, I have no objections.  It was well done, directed, and acted.  Period costumes were wonderful.  London society captivated my attention.  After I watched the series, I took the time to read some of her biographical information about Lillie Langtry's real life. However, as one reviewer put it mildly, the woman pretty much prostituted herself to make her way to the top of society. I found her character to be shallow, calculating, and oddly irritating. As a result, I felt compelled to fast forward through some of the final episodes just to be done with it. I was tired of Langtry's attitude, her voice, and her actions. I had lost my respect for the woman. I'm sure London society, in all of its glamor, glitz, and royalty had its share of adultery and mistresses.  Everyone pretty much knows that Bertie was quite the risque fellow, who frequented the famous brothels of Paris on his trips besides having mistresses of his own.  Nevertheless, as great of a period piece that it was, I found myself feeling quite saddened by a life who may have been popular with the men of London, but underneath all the frills of her dresses, there appeared to be a cold and calculating heart.

Most well-known for having been the mistress of the Prince of Wales, Lillie as portrayed by Francesca Annis appears to be a strong, courageous woman who is not afraid to follow her own path in order to find some measure of happiness and success in her life. Unconventional in her thinking, she challenges the traditional notion of a woman's role in society as imposed upon the women of her time, and breaks free of those conventions to make a lasting mark. As the blurb on the DVD goes ""Lillie Langtry played by a new set of rules. Her own.""
