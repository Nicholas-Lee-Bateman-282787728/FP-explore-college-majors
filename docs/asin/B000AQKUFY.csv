931242,A26N2CRHILURM2,B000AQKUFY,"VOICE OF VICTORIA ""STEVE""","[1, 1]",If their movies are all you know about the Martin and Lewis partnership this will give you a better feel for what they really did best.The movies were OK but very formulaic and the repeated casting of Martin as a heel and as a straight man to feed Jerry set up lines was a big factor in Dean's growing resentment and their ultimate break up.Martin and Lewis were the biggest thing in showbiz before Elvis and incited screaming and mobbing. Their main forte was live but they also did a good radio show (see The Comedic Genius of Martin and Lewis radio podcast for free examples!) and this excellent show on which they were one of the rotating hosts.The picturequality is pretty low as its pretty early TV but there is much to admire in the comedy there are some good skits and some fascinating guest artists but the main attraction is the segments where Martin and Lewis perform with their nightclub orchestra lead by Dick Stabile. The most common format is Dean tries to sing while Jerry interrupts in various ways. They argue they interact with their band. They could both sing dance and do comedy as well as other old school vaudeville tricks like rolling hats and twirling canes. The interaction between the two is what makes it tick and they push each other to greater absurdity and they both clearly love what they are doing. If you can tolerate the picture quality its worth it. Watch a skit or two on Youtube to get the idea.The stars are for the performances.,5,BRILLIANT!,1329696000,"02 20, 2012",2012,1468,"['movies', 'are', 'know', 'Martin', 'Lewis', 'partnership', 'will', 'give', 'better', 'feel', 'what', 'really', 'did', 'best.The', 'movies', 'were', 'OK', 'very', 'formulaic', 'repeated', 'casting', 'Martin', 'heel', 'straight', 'man', 'feed', 'Jerry', 'set', 'up', 'lines', 'was', 'big', 'factor', 'Dean', 'growing', 'resentment', 'ultimate', 'break', 'up.Martin', 'Lewis', 'were', 'biggest', 'thing', 'showbiz', 'Elvis', 'incited', 'screaming', 'mobbing', 'main', 'forte', 'was', 'live', 'also', 'did', 'good', 'radio', 'show', 'see', 'Comedic', 'Genius', 'Martin', 'Lewis', 'radio', 'podcast', 'free', 'examples', 'excellent', 'show', 'were', 'one', 'rotating', 'hosts.The', 'picturequality', 'pretty', 'low', 'pretty', 'early', 'TV', 'much', 'admire', 'comedy', 'are', 'good', 'skits', 'fascinating', 'guest', 'artists', 'main', 'attraction', 'segments', 'where', 'Martin', 'Lewis', 'perform', 'nightclub', 'orchestra', 'lead', 'Dick', 'Stabile', 'most', 'common', 'format', 'Dean', 'tries', 'sing', 'Jerry', 'interrupts', 'various', 'ways', 'argue', 'interact', 'band', 'could', 'both', 'sing', 'dance', 'do', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'old', 'school', 'vaudeville', 'tricks', 'rolling', 'hats', 'twirling', 'canes', 'interaction', 'two', 'what', 'tick', 'push', 'other', 'greater', 'absurdity', 'clearly', 'love', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'can', 'tolerate', 'picture', 'quality', 'worth', 'Watch', 'skit', 'two', 'Youtube', 'get', 'idea.The', 'stars', 'are', 'performances']",N/A
