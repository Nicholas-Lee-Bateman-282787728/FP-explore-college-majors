1122890,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000ZN802W,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[1, 4]","Sean Penn, who has proven himself to be an accomplished and intense actor, takes the director helm just as seriously.  His vision of Chris McCandless's life (via Jon Krakauer's book `Into the Wild') is simply stunning.  While most pictures that go outdoors give you some breathtaking scenes, this film makes the close shots of formidable and forbidding nature a staple element throughout the movie.  Having just watched the movie at a local cinema with a smaller screen, I was content, not needing a big screen TV or a visit to the I-Max.  To sustain a story and an outdoor adventure for nearly two and a half hours is a feat unto itself, but the characters and reflections are satisfying enough to take the audience to its destination.Besides Penn's perfectionism, we have a fine story told well.  Starting with Chris's real life journal, we go back and forth from his well-to-do family back to his destination on the outskirts of Fairbanks, and then trace back his journey along the way until he reached his destination.  Chris had all the trappings of success.  An ""A"" student with a wealthy family to help him along the way, something was, nevertheless, missing.  To fill in the gaps, his sister (Jena Malone) narrates part of the story, telling us about the family he left behind.  Then, he encounters all kinds of people from the working class farmers of South Dakota, to a latent hippie couple in Arizona, to a retired military man in California.  Like road stories from films like `Easy Rider'Easy Riderto books like Kerouac's `On the Road,'On the Road (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)this is a high caliber road movie, even if the destination is off the beaten path. With all its grandeur and absorbing development, this movie reminded me of the truly excellent 'Never Cry Wolf,'Never Cry Wolfwhich this film has easily trumped.Trouble is Chris's problems don't resolve themselves with nature.  In his journal, he expresses his thought well and quotes the works of Thoreau, Tolstoy, and Pasternak who help him share his vision of happiness that can't be bought.  Nature can be quite unforgiving, but the wisdom Chris picks up along the way make his uncompromising attempt to live life on his own terms both laudably courageous and a cautionary tale told to the rest of us.All of the performances are as true to life as the footage.  Including William Hurt who gives us another laudable performance as Chris's driven father, Walt, a successful space engineer.  Emile Hirsch captures all the spirit and naivete' of Chris, and Marcia Gay Harden is perfect as the worried, doting mom.  But the real master is Penn who is able to share Chris's vision.  Meaningful, poetic, colorful, eventful, and magnificent in grandeur, `Into the Wild' is simply a cinematic Odyssey taken by a careful hand who wanted to make both the man and his journey unforgettable.",5,Into the Sublime,1193529600,"10 28, 2007",2007,2867,"['Sean', 'Penn', 'who', 'proven', 'be', 'accomplished', 'intense', 'actor', 'director', 'helm', 'just', 'as', 'seriously', 'vision', 'Chris', 'McCandless', 'life', 'Jon', 'Krakauer', 'book', 'Wild', 'simply', 'stunning', 'most', 'pictures', 'go', 'outdoors', 'give', 'breathtaking', 'scenes', 'film', 'close', 'shots', 'formidable', 'forbidding', 'nature', 'staple', 'element', 'movie', 'Having', 'just', 'watched', 'movie', 'local', 'cinema', 'smaller', 'screen', 'was', 'content', 'not', 'needing', 'big', 'screen', 'TV', 'visit', 'I-Max', 'sustain', 'story', 'outdoor', 'adventure', 'nearly', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'feat', 'unto', 'characters', 'reflections', 'are', 'satisfying', 'enough', 'take', 'audience', 'destination.Besides', 'Penn', 'perfectionism', 'have', 'fine', 'story', 'told', 'well', 'Starting', 'Chris', 'real', 'life', 'journal', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'well-to-do', 'family', 'back', 'destination', 'outskirts', 'Fairbanks', 'then', 'trace', 'back', 'journey', 'way', 'reached', 'destination', 'Chris', 'had', 'trappings', 'success', 'A', 'student', 'wealthy', 'family', 'help', 'way', 'something', 'was', 'nevertheless', 'missing', 'fill', 'gaps', 'sister', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'part', 'story', 'telling', 'family', 'left', 'behind', 'Then', 'kinds', 'people', 'working', 'class', 'farmers', 'South', 'Dakota', 'latent', 'hippie', 'couple', 'Arizona', 'retired', 'military', 'man', 'California', 'road', 'stories', 'films', 'Easy', ""Rider'Easy"", 'Riderto', 'books', 'Kerouac', 'Road', 'Road', 'Penguin', 'Great', 'Books', '20th', 'Century', 'high', 'caliber', 'road', 'movie', 'even', 'destination', 'beaten', 'path', 'grandeur', 'absorbing', 'development', 'movie', 'reminded', 'truly', 'excellent', 'Cry', 'Wolf', 'Cry', 'Wolfwhich', 'film', 'easily', 'trumped.Trouble', 'Chris', 'problems', 'do', ""n't"", 'resolve', 'nature', 'journal', 'thought', 'well', 'works', 'Thoreau', 'Tolstoy', 'Pasternak', 'who', 'help', 'share', 'vision', 'happiness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bought', 'Nature', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'unforgiving', 'wisdom', 'Chris', 'up', 'way', 'make', 'uncompromising', 'attempt', 'live', 'life', 'own', 'terms', 'laudably', 'courageous', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'told', 'rest', 'us.All', 'performances', 'are', 'true', 'life', 'footage', 'Including', 'William', 'Hurt', 'who', 'laudable', 'performance', 'Chris', 'driven', 'father', 'Walt', 'successful', 'space', 'engineer', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'spirit', 'naivete', 'Chris', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'perfect', 'worried', 'doting', 'mom', 'real', 'master', 'Penn', 'who', 'able', 'share', 'Chris', 'vision', 'Meaningful', 'poetic', 'colorful', 'eventful', 'magnificent', 'grandeur', 'Wild', 'simply', 'cinematic', 'Odyssey', 'taken', 'careful', 'hand', 'who', 'wanted', 'make', 'man', 'journey', 'unforgettable']",N/A

1122894,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000ZN802W,Alistair McHarg,"[31, 49]","Into The Wild, Sean Penn's adaptation of the Christopher McCandless story; runs 140 minutes but feels more like 200.  Indeed, when the giant grizzly shows up at his bus I was praying it would put him, and us, out of our collective misery.  (Note to Hollywood, basing a movie on an interesting true story does not automatically guarantee an interesting movie.)What the film does do convincingly is reaffirm the idea that - despite considerable acting skill - Sean Penn remains a very simple-minded man drawn to naive, two-dimensional explanations for multi-faceted, complex questions.  What McCandless did is remarkable, what's remarkable about this movie is that it fails to provide any insight at all into why he did it.To risk life and limb, to renounce the advantages of bourgeois society, to abandon family, to live a life so solitary monks would think it odd - demands intense motivation.  We are offered the obligatory bait of Thoreau, but Christopher isn't running into the embrace of nature, he is fleeing the company of men.  We're thrown a scrap or two about contempt for the hypocrisy of society and worship of all that is material.  But Chris is only too willing to ride rails, hitch in cars of all types, and nestle into a hunter's cabin (bus) that has been well outfitted.  We understand most vividly what he actually is as he negotiates the soft underbelly of L.A. at night - he's a bum.Unfortunately for the story, Emile Hirsch is affable and charming - which helps perpetuate the myth that Chris is some well-intentioned social misfit having a bit of soul-searching adventure.  For this story to make any sense at all, that can't be true.  If the story had had human interaction, we might have gotten to know him.  (As Sean Penn's incredibly heavy hand points out at the end of this film, the happiness Chris seeks can only be found in sharing with others.)  But even on those rare occasions when we have the illusion of contact, (Holbrook, Vaughn, Keener), Chris is an emotional succubus, unwilling to share anything truer about himself than the word, ""Alaska.""Although we never see them, three forces drive Chris.  The first is an intense anger, even hatred, lurking beneath that boyish smile - hatred for his parents, his father in particular, and ultimately, self-loathing.  (How else can we explain his willingness to let them agonize about his fate?  He wants to hurt them.)  Next is a staggering narcissism - his self-seeking is done in a void, as if all other people are merely extras in his movie.  Last is an addictive attraction to self-destruction, his self-destruction is an orgasmic narcotic, and it is also an act of revenge.  Hirsch and Penn are equally to blame for this failure.What's best about the movie - the Alaskan scenery and other jewels of cinematography - is also what's worst, it's a lovely distraction.  The quest that Chris allegedly embarked upon does not lead into wild nature, but into the wild heart.  Make it out of there alive, and you've got a real movie.",2,Into the Lobby,1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,3009,"['Wild', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'adaptation', 'Christopher', 'McCandless', 'story', '140', 'minutes', 'feels', 'more', '200', 'Indeed', 'when', 'giant', 'grizzly', 'up', 'bus', 'was', 'praying', 'would', 'put', 'collective', 'misery', 'Note', 'Hollywood', 'basing', 'movie', 'interesting', 'true', 'story', 'not', 'automatically', 'guarantee', 'interesting', 'movie', 'What', 'film', 'do', 'convincingly', 'reaffirm', 'idea', 'considerable', 'acting', 'skill', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'very', 'simple-minded', 'man', 'drawn', 'naive', 'two-dimensional', 'explanations', 'multi-faceted', 'complex', 'questions', 'What', 'McCandless', 'did', 'remarkable', 'what', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'provide', 'insight', 'why', 'did', 'it.To', 'risk', 'life', 'limb', 'renounce', 'advantages', 'bourgeois', 'society', 'abandon', 'family', 'live', 'life', 'so', 'solitary', 'monks', 'would', 'think', 'odd', 'demands', 'intense', 'motivation', 'are', 'offered', 'obligatory', 'bait', 'Thoreau', 'Christopher', ""n't"", 'running', 'embrace', 'nature', 'fleeing', 'company', 'men', ""'re"", 'thrown', 'scrap', 'two', 'contempt', 'hypocrisy', 'society', 'worship', 'material', 'Chris', 'only', 'too', 'willing', 'ride', 'rails', 'hitch', 'cars', 'types', 'nestle', 'hunter', 'cabin', 'bus', 'been', 'well', 'outfitted', 'understand', 'most', 'vividly', 'what', 'actually', 'soft', 'underbelly', 'L.A.', 'night', 'bum.Unfortunately', 'story', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'affable', 'charming', 'perpetuate', 'myth', 'Chris', 'well-intentioned', 'social', 'misfit', 'having', 'bit', 'soul-searching', 'adventure', 'story', 'make', 'sense', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'true', 'story', 'had', 'had', 'human', 'interaction', 'might', 'have', 'gotten', 'know', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'incredibly', 'heavy', 'hand', 'points', 'out', 'end', 'film', 'happiness', 'Chris', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'sharing', 'others', 'even', 'rare', 'occasions', 'when', 'have', 'illusion', 'contact', 'Holbrook', 'Vaughn', 'Keener', 'Chris', 'emotional', 'succubus', 'unwilling', 'share', 'anything', 'truer', 'word', 'Alaska', 'never', 'see', 'three', 'forces', 'drive', 'Chris', 'first', 'intense', 'anger', 'even', 'hatred', 'lurking', 'beneath', 'boyish', 'smile', 'hatred', 'parents', 'father', 'particular', 'ultimately', 'self-loathing', 'How', 'else', 'can', 'explain', 'willingness', 'let', 'agonize', 'fate', 'hurt', 'Next', 'staggering', 'narcissism', 'self-seeking', 'done', 'void', 'other', 'people', 'are', 'merely', 'extras', 'movie', 'Last', 'addictive', 'attraction', 'self-destruction', 'self-destruction', 'orgasmic', 'narcotic', 'also', 'act', 'revenge', 'Hirsch', 'Penn', 'are', 'equally', 'blame', 'failure.What', 'best', 'movie', 'Alaskan', 'scenery', 'other', 'jewels', 'cinematography', 'also', 'what', 'worst', 'lovely', 'distraction', 'quest', 'Chris', 'allegedly', 'embarked', 'upon', 'not', 'lead', 'wild', 'nature', 'wild', 'heart', 'Make', 'alive', ""'ve"", 'got', 'real', 'movie']",N/A

The 1997 book of the same name tells the story of Chris McCandless, an emotional and highly independent young man who set himself up against the Alaskan wilderness in the summer of 1992, and lost.  The 2007 movie, directed by Sean Penn, is only slighly fictionalized and has the advantage (in my opinion) of skipping a chapter by book author Jon Krakauer that was much more about himself than about McCandless.  Emile Hirsch deserves high praise in his portrayal of McCandless, a role that required him to lose 40 pounds during filming.  The top-notch supporting cast includes Marcia Gay Harden, William Hurt and Jena Malone as McCandless' family.  Brian Kierker, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughan and Hal Holbrook portray some of the many people McCandless met in the Western United States before his ill-fated trip to Alaska.

1122900,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000ZN802W,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 4]","One thing that can't be overstated about Sean Penn's `Into the Wild' is that it truly is a breathtaking cinematic experience.  The films vivid scenes are beautiful to watch and come alive in the viewer.  There are moments of such crisp realism that we feel we are right alongside McCandless in his journeys.  The Alaskan countryside is flawlessly depicted (although pictures never do anything justice...I've been there and I can honestly say it is the most beautiful place on mother earth...`Into the Wild' comes very close to capturing it though).  The action sequences are masterfully edited to where we feel one with them, like we are in that canoe or on that train or crossing that creek.Sadly though, what is visually breathtaking is no so much emotionally breathtaking.  By the close of the film we don't feel as though we really understand the man that is Christopher McCandless.  We come to know Alexander Supertramp but McCandless is a mystery.  Maybe this is because McCandless never truly found himself, but as the film draws to a close and we are supposed to feel the revelations this man is finally realizing I have to cry wolf.  As McCandless scribbles into his journal that he feels scarred and lonely I found myself scratching my head, because I never got that from him.  The film paints McCandless as one thing and one thing only; self absorbed.  He runs from human interaction and thrives on being one with nature.  That is all fine in itself but as the running time starts to give way to credits Penn tries desperately to prove McCandless has seen the folly in his ways and come to realize he needs human interaction to survive.  I guess maybe he attempts this too late in the film and only give the audience a good five minutes to embrace this concept.It doesn't quite work.The film follows the two-year journey of Christopher McCandless as he picks up after graduating college and sets off on an adventure of a lifetime.  He donates his entire saving to charity, burns whatever money he has left and hitches his way across the continent with nothing really but the clothes on his back and a few awkward supplies.  He sets his sights on Alaska, but he's not opposed to a few stops along the way.  From Colorado to Mexico and just about everywhere in between McCandless meets many people that supposedly shape the outcome of his outlook on life.  McCandless grew up in a house filled with yelling and fighting and threatened divorce.  Not that that doesn't take place in 75% of all homes in America but regardless, this is what he was up against.  Feeling as though he had no family he decided to leave everything behind and find himself.  What he found, or so we're told, was loneliness and fear; but of course that came after all the fun and excitement.Whatever must be said for the portrayal of McCandless it has nothing to do with the performance given by Emile Hirsch.  I am not usually moved or even impressed with this young man but this has to be his finest performance to date (the fact that he does all of his own stunts and loses Christian Bale amounts of weight here shows great dedication and also plays in his favor).  He seems to understand the selfishness that lives within his character and he exudes it in a very subtle way, one that could be justified by some as free-spirited but is without doubt selfish dependence.  The only place in which his performance falters is when he is asked to portray an ounce of regret as the film closes, but again I feel that is not his fault as much as it is the fault of the unfair time restraint placed on him by Penn.The entire cast rises to the challenge in this film, and while much of the film revolves around McCandless in his solidarity there is much to be said for actors who can do so much with so little.  Harden and Hurt may not be seen much if not within flashbacks, but they each have their own scenes of splendid bliss (the scene where Hurt collapses in the street broke my heart).  Jena Malone is poorly underused (I just love her) but makes an impression as Christopher's sister Carine.  I've never seen her look so beautiful, that's for sure.  Vince Vaughn seems a little out of place for me here but he manages to deliver well, and Kristen Stewart is just delightful as Tracy.  I remember watching her in `In the Land of Women' and thinking that she had much to offer if it were only tapped a little better and here she proves that that tapping is well underway.  Catherine Keener develops a beautiful character in Jan and Brian Dierker works off of his co-stars wonderfully as Rainey.Above all else, Hirsch included, is the magnificent Hal Holbrook.  His beautiful and touching portrayal of Ron Franz, the old man who takes Chris under his wing, is the most memorable supporting character in the film.  What Ron does with his small screen time (roughly fifteen minutes, give or take) is really more than anyone else does here.  His final scene with Hirsch is so moving, so touching and ultimately so heartbreaking.  I'm almost moved to tears just recalling it now.As a whole I think that `Into the Wild' is a well done film, it just misses the biggest mark it sets out to make; and that is of making McCandless a real person.  I have a few issues with some of the decisions made production wise with the film (like the horrible yellow writing that scribbles across the screen...which makes the film appear kind of cheap in a way) but they are not enough to knock stars off for.  No, the only reason this film does not receive a five star rating from me is the mere fact that the final five minutes or so try and paint Chris as a changed man, and five minutes is not long enough to convince me of that.  Had Penn given Hirsch a good twenty minutes to nurse the idea then maybe it would have been convincing, but sadly it was not.",4,Takes us into the wild but never really takes us into the

On the other, it's quite another thing to just drop out of your family's life completely.  I found the boy - and he always was a boy, he never became a man - to be selfish and irresponsible.  Even my daughter, who normally is very counter-culture, was irritated by him, by his naivete and refusal to acknowledge that life isn't only about you, it's about how you deal with and treat others.

1122905,A29ZEV20RCXV1D,B000ZN802W,"Anthony J. Lomenzo ""Doc Tony""","[2, 4]","First, I'll get my admitted bias out of the way: Whenever 'Hollywood' gets a hold of something that is hawked as ""based on true events"", this should be a huge red flag to viewers that they should make it their business to research the alleged ""based on true events"" in order to separate the Hollywood tendency to engage in both directorial ""creative license"" and ""for the sake of the plot"" alterations. Unfortunately, there are folks who see the proverbial 'Silver Screen' [or book [Jon Krakauer] for that matter] version of the alleged ""facts"" and that's the end of it.So too, there is in this particular case both in the book and in the subsequent movie to 'romanticize' Chris McCandless and that his eventual death by starvation, yes, I said 'starvation' and not plant poisoning, and his venturing into the wilderness only to die there was somehow a ""noble cause"" [!] and, what then, worthy of emulation?Take the time to read the autopsy report and the additional [which later morphed to 'moldy seeds' which purportedly prevents the digestion process and hence 'kills over time'] when the plant poisoning per se could not be scientifically supported [after analysis] and note the differences in the plant 'culprit' between the book and the movie] with regard to the alleged death via accidental plant poisoning. Some even suggest it was on purpose for the, and I quote now, ""ultimate self-sacrifice statement"" [sic]! Look at the list of those things found in Chris's possession when he was found dead in the bus by moose hunters 'including' a map and including, inter alia, money found in a compartment of his pack. And while some may actually 'relate' to previous wordage from McCandless where his parents were relegated by him as ""idiots"" [sic], it remains interesting that his otherwise close sibling relationship to his sister finds her written off for two years as well ... along with the rest of society in general save for those who could assist Chris in his singular quest for both Thoreau-like isolation and Jack London type wilderness living albeit in a most unforgiving environment. And no prior experience in such endeavors.There is a DVD out by Ron Lamothe [Terra Incognita Films -- see their website and read the Krakauer book rebuttal piece] based on a Chris McCandless documentary and decidedly worth a look. It's called ""The Call of the Wild."" Hence my Paul Harvey analogy and ""the rest of the story."" So too, there are countless essays on the matter but various of which offer 'documented' input [versus conjecture] that was not incorporated into the Jon Krakauer book nor the subsequent 2007 Sean Penn film nor corrected therein [although Krakauer 'modified' his view on the plant poisoning to a matter of inherently poisonous 'moldy seeds'] when the 'rest of the story' was related. There have also been essays with regard to psychological/psychiatric issues and worth reading. Interesting here too when such 'mental' facility issues are discussed at various and sundry websites with regard to the actions of Chris McCandless, there is almost always various voices 'countering' such psychological/psychiatric speculation and protracted discussion as ""pure hogwash"" [sic] via the old chestnut defense of ""medicalizing dissent"" as if to suggest that McCandless actions were perfectly normal and ""entirely sane"" and ""happen all the time"" ...]. What may also amaze readers is the myriad of websites out there where everything from Alaska folks 'per se' are supposedly ""all anti-McCandless haters by nature"" [! -- sic] or ""Society 'is' sick, overly materialistic and evil [...] Chris did what he had to do!"" [! -- sic] but then as more than a few wags put it, ""... when you abandon your family, your car, your friends and you give away all your money [$24,000 grad school savings] and burn the rest on hand and head for the wilderness for which you are totally ill prepared to deal with and survive in the process .. this is not so much an attempt to 'find yourself', as much as a matter of already being quite lost!""Read 'the rest of the story' -- it's out there and if 'only' to get a balance between the book and the movie. Then, well, you make the call but a call in 'addition' to the book/movie version of the events.So why the 3 stars in my review, you ask? Fair question: The movie was very well acted! I think Emile Hirsch gave a great performance as did the supporting cast. It's the 'facts' however of the ""based on true events"" that account for the missing stars.

Answer to the quest he gave to himself was all there..., but he didn't listen (but kept talking).  I think it's easy to be absorbed into McCandless's view point and ignore every other character's, because it feels all so urgently important.  At least that's how I felt when I was obsessed with my own world view when I was at his phase.No spoiler for you.  :-DThe HD-DVD version of this movie is essentially the same as the 2-disc Special Edition (but with native 1080p resolution of course).

I suppose slow-paced dramas simply aren't my cup of tea. But OK, here's a heroic attempt...""Into the Wild"" tells the more or less true story of Christopher McCandless a.k.a. Alexander Supertramp, a confused young man on a quest throughout America to find his true self and the meaning of life, while attempting to escape from a dysfunctional family. Like many others, he tries to find ultimate meaning in pristine wilderness, inspired by Thoreau. However, his odyssey ends tragically as he turns out to be unfit for the harsh life in the Alaskan hinterland. Or maybe not so tragically, since he somehow finds closure and enlightenment in his last dying moments...The main protagonist is offered redemption and meaning at several points during his journeys, for instance by the old hippie couple or by Ron Franz (the old man). Franz also advises him about forgiveness. He is also offered love by a teenage girl. Yet, Supertramp constantly refuses the offers, being obsessed about going alone to Alaska. Perhaps this is the conflict ""Into the Wild"" wants to explore: are we redeemed by social relationships, or can we find meaning alone? Supertramp clearly believes the latter, constantly quoting his beloved Thoreau. However, the end of the story suggests that the real solution is the former: Supertramp is a complete failure in the wilderness, and his last words about having lived a good life obviously refer to his camaraderie with other members of the human race. Yet, his death isn't portrayed as tragic. Rather, he is reunited with his parents and sister in a near-death experience, after first being swallowed and killed by cruel nature.I'm not sure if this is the ""true"" interpretation of ""Into the Wild"", but if it is, it suggests that what we're looking for cannot be found in pristine wilderness or splendid isolation from our fellow man. Somehow, I find that a more uplifting message than the crank deep ecology many others see in this film, and which I also saw the first time I watched it. I actually skipped most of ""Into the Wild"" when Swedish TV was showing it a few years ago, seeing it as yet another Timothy Treadwell story.

I'd read the book a few years ago and enjoyed it, but it left me feeling a bit bitter about someone as privileged as Chris McCandless (the main character/person in Jon Krakauer's nonfiction novel by the same name) who shuns his upper echelon possibilities after graduating from Emory and disappears into America, leading the free life of a moneyless vagabond.Certainly we've all thought about what it would be like to be completely unencumbered by the shackles of ""things."" No cars. No mortgages/rent. Nothing but the open road and endless options spreading out before us. And this is what makes us care for Chris McCandless, the unfortunate (and very misguided) young man who's fate is tied to his own ignorance of what that kind of life entails.If you speak to anyone from Alaska, most will tell you what an idiot McCandless was. He went into the wild with only a backpack and a rifle, supposedly ""ready"" to live the life of a hermit on a decrepit and abandoned school bus. The Alaskan wilderness (or any comparable wilderness really) is unforgiving. If you aren't prepared, you're going to die. And McCandless, with his lofty dreams of wildlife living, was ill-prepared in the extreme; his life cut short due to his own ignorance.So why the five star rating, you may ask? Well, I'm not here to support or degrade what McCandless did or didn't do. I'm here to rate the film, and on that, you can't help but appreciate what director Sean Penn has given us. Showing McCandless' strengths and weaknesses, Penn guides us through the life of Chris without telling us how to feel about it. Actor Emile Hirsch pulls in an extremely powerful performance as Chris McCandless. The fact that the Academy didn't recognize him is a shame; they did note Hal Holbrook's supporting actor performance (which was damn good), but a far cry from Hirsch's awesome job (he lost 40 lbs during the filming so that he could show McCandless' starvation). Penn's screenwriting and directing are flat-out amazing, giving us a story that allows the viewer to make his or her own judgements about this very enigmatic young man.I feel compelled to mention that some may compare McCandless' actions with those of another dead Alaskan visitor, Timothy Treadwell of the nonfiction filmGrizzly Man. Although both certainly had their failings, Treadwell was definitely mentally ill, while McCandless simply seemed to lack life goals and instead substituted vagrancy in order to run away from problems back home.In the end, I finally came to the conclusion that Penn did exactly what all great film makers do: he gave us a story that many people probably would've found pretentious and plopped it into our laps without any filters or rose-coloring. That put the burden on the audience to come to terms with what McCandless' life really meant. Fool? Free-Spirit? Ignorant preppie? Loving brother? Easy-going drifter?

1122923,AYC3Y4QX7GATV,B000ZN802W,"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts""","[5, 8]","I enjoyed reading Krakauer's book at least ten years ago.  The book accepted the responsibility of trying to ""solve the mystery"" of McCandless's death, which at first glance is the only reason we'd be interested in this story.Yet Krakauer's narrative incorporated the whole story of the young man, not just the specific events that lead to his death.  Was this because facts were desperately hard to come by (from Chris's acquaintances, the McCandless family, and certainly from Chris himself)?  Did Krakauer's editor needed some bulk (as I originally thought)?  Or was it because the nature of McCandless's realty was the more important story?Coming after the book, the movie must accept the burden of its predecessor.  But in the case of ""Into The Wild,"" Sean Penn took direct aim at the riddle of McCandless's individuality, circumstances, and personal reality, and how they shaped the events that lead to his death.  The movie places its emphasis on the person (vs. the mystery of how he died, the exact details of which we will never know), and I found this a very worthy approach.  Perhaps the McCandless family, after more than a decade had passed, was more comfortable sharing details about Chris's home life making it easier for Penn to explore their influence more deeply.Unlike the less enthusiastic reviewers, I found the exploration into McCandless's personality to be absolutely facinating.  By nature, I am a saver of money; a conserver of personal resources.  I'm a person who is always thinking about my way out of a situation, ready with a plan ""B."" So I was facinated by McCandless, for whom practical concerns like this were irritating distractions.He was a benevolent soul by any measure.  In lieu of feeding his body, he fed on life experience and challenge.  Was McCandless lonely throughout his journey?  We don't know until near the end.  Tragically, the little voices whispering warnings about risks and self-preservation inside his head, were inaudible to Chris McCandless.Was he looking for freedom and adventure?  Or safety, understanding, and love - in a world in which he did not belong?The highlights for me were the balanced screenplay taking the high road on all these issues, and the wonderful cast from top to bottom (particularly the Hal Holbrook performance - You start off wondering why such a small part could be Oscar nomination-worthy, then you watch it, and it breaks your heart, and you understand.)I wonder if someone will (has it been done yet?) make a movie about Krakauer's book about Mt.

Pfleeger,"[0, 1]","In Sean Penn's magnificently acted film Into the Wild we get the story of Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) who abandons his upper middle class existence to go an adventure first to the American West and then into the deep wilds of Alaska. Based on the book by Jon Krakauer, Penn does an admirable job telling the story of a youthful nomad in the early 1990's.The cast features great performances by nearly all players. From the bewildered parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden), to the sister who deeply loves her brother and is troubled by his actions (Jena Malone) to the friends he meets along the way: aging hippie couple Jan and Rainey (Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker), midwestern farmer (Vince Vaughn) to kindly old man who wants to adopt him (Hal Holbrook) all play a part in showing Christopher the meaning of happiness. There can only be true happiness when it is shared with others.The film apart from the acting looks remarkable. Cinematographer Eric Gautier does Oscar worthy work here and his work on locatio in Alaska is breathtaking. Also worthy of mention is the music. The score by Michael Brook and Kaki King with songs by Eddie Vedder add considerably to the overall viewing experience.I viewed the HD disc by Paramount and was quite pleased with the presentation. The one minus is that there are not the wealth of special features found on the two disc standard definition set.

The young mans journey from family shelter to wilderness starvation is brave but misguided. I especially like the scenes on the river. However; a tighter edited version bringing it in around two hours would have been better received. The story of a man throwing away his parents values and striking out on his own is not new. The method used to show us that journey was unique. Good acting and great scenery make this worth a rental. We have all stumbled during our years after High School or even after College, but few cast common sense to the wind. McCandles does, so although we sympathize with his convictions, we cannot applaud his lack of logic.In college I too went camping to get away from it all and I even jumped off a seventy-five foot clift into water with rocks everywhere. Do you truly think if I had hit one of those rocks they would think it was a great story to make a movie about? Doubtful but even I was an experienced diver and so although not brilliant, at least I knew what I was doing. Just as I went camping with my father and anyone else with experience before going into the wild on my own. So although the movie has good acting, great camera work, and excellent directing, that doesn't make me like the story. Afterall lots of hippies did this during the 1960s and I don't see books or movies about most of them. I guess because thats old stuff and Sean Penn didn't direct a movie about it.

1122932,A11SPSEM08VIXX,B000ZN802W,"Carbonadam ""Ladies and gentleman, I hope that...","[4, 6]","This film based on the book was done somewhat well. It was not all it could have been. This film should have been made years ago. While this was very faithful to the book it somehow lacks some of the emotional soul this story needs. The book lets you know on the cover that he died. Knowing this is what makes the book excellent. This is not some thriller that needs a gotcha ending. Knowing he dies from jump gives more weight and gravity to everything he does while you read the book. The film should have been told the same way.Penn employed too many nifty tricks to bring points across that could have been implied or inferred more subtly far better by a more skilled filmmaker. The MTV style film making was not needed. Simple ground level hand held up close and personal camera work would have been the best way to go. In this film you experience the wild like a bird, far too often. Supertramp himself never saw what we see in this film.Penn also could not resist putting his liberal stink all over this film. It's too bad too. The book never read like parts of the film do. The book never had an agenda, nor did Chris, beyond his simple soul searching. penn, I know and can tell, hopes to change the world into a Robin Hood free for all. Chris may have made choices such as burning money, abandoning his car, and such. They were personal statements and his ego had nothing to do with it. He was making the statements to himself, not like Penn loves to do, showing off to the world.I do not remember so much animosity towards the parents in the book. I do not know that that was the best way to show his drive to do what he did. Everyone has nutty parents. They don't get us kids with handbooks. The whole, ""my parents fought and yelled so i have problems"" is wearing a bit thin in our society. This irked me a bit. Even if it was true, that he did have resentment for his folks, it was still unnecessary for so much of it to be peppered throughout the story as if it was the very impetus for him to run. He was not running from anything, he was running TO something. I am not sure Penn understands that. In the book it was clear.The best film of this type, and also one of the best films ever is ""Never Cry Wolf"". It shows, without too much conflict, death, or preachy talking, exactly what the wild can be like.Into The Wild is a few notches  below Never Cry Wolf and also extremely sad. Sad is not a bad thing but I could not just pop this in every so often. Never Cry Wolf  I can watch over and over and over. Anyone who enjoyed this film will love Never Cry Wolf .Despite all of the above, this film was far more thoughtful and important than 98% of the junk that gets made. It was overlooked and needed to be considered a more important film this year. I hope more films like this get made in the future.

I read a review that she ran around in her underwear for the entire movie. Not true. She was in one short scene in her underwear with, of course, skin colored undies her underwear. She was about 16 when she did that movie.The story was entertaining as movies go. BUT, it was not believable. The story was jacked up with such things as his killing a Moose with a .22 caliber rifle. No way. I've been in the back country of Alaska and no sane person would try to kill a Moose with a .22, unless he wanted to be killed by an angry Moose. Also the star Emile Hirsch, fell into a raging Alaskan river just as after spring broke. He walked back to an old bus with broken out windows for shelter. Again, in the spring in Alaska if you fall into a raging, icy river and manage to get out, you die later that night. Night temperatures in Alaska will go below Zero in the spring. As for his journey, he went from Virginia to Colorado, to Arizona then California before going to Alaska.He did all of this traveling and at some point burned his money. He kept a diary, that is how we know all about his exploits. Well, it was a real man who made the trip and died in an old bus in Alaska.The only part I really believe is his dying in a bus in Alaska. The rest of it is not believable, been there and done some of that. But it was oh-so-heart warming. It wasn't until after I saw the movie that I read on the DVD cover that it was written and directed by Sean Penn. I do not care for any of his work, acting or writing or directing.

1122935,AVH4LC6EDRVWG,B000ZN802W,"Catherine Todd ""interested in all""","[235, 298]","Excerpted quotes from Ranger Peter Christian are from a document available at George Mason University (pasted below):[...]Chris McCandless from an Alaska Park Ranger's Perspectiveby Peter ChristianBoth Chris McCandless and I arrived in Alaska in 1992. We both came to Alaska fromthe area around Washington, D.C. We were both about the same age and had a similaridea in mind; to live a free life in the Alaska wild. Fourteen years later Chris McCandlessis dead and I am living the dream I set out to win for myself. What made the differencein these two outcomes?There was nothing heroic or even mysterious about what Chris McCandless did in April1992. Like many Alaskans, I read Jon Krakauer's book ""Into the Wild"" when it firstcame out and finished it thinking, ""why does this guy rate an entire book?"" The fact thatKrakauer is a great outdoor writer and philosopher is the bright spot and it makes a greatread, but McCandless was not something special.As a park ranger both at Denali National Park, very near where McCandless died, andnow at Gates of the Arctic National Park, even more remote and wild than Denali, I amexposed continually to what I will call the ""McCandless Phenomenon."" People, nearlyalways young men, come to Alaska to challenge themselves against an unforgivingwilderness landscape where convenience of access and possibility of rescue arepractically nonexistent. I know the personality type because I was one of those youngmen.In fact, Alaska is populated with people who are either running away from something orseeking themselves in America's last frontier. It is a place very much like the frontier ofthe Old West where you can come to and reinvent yourself. In reality, most people whomake it as far as Alaska never get past the cities of Fairbanks and Anchorage becauseaccess is so difficult and expensive (usually by airplane), travel is so hard, the terrain ischallenging, the bears are real, and so on.A very few competent and skillful people make a successful go at living a free life in thewild, build a home in the mountains, raise their children there and eventually come backwith good stories and happy endings. A greater number give it a try, realize it is neithereasy nor romantic, just damn hard work, and quickly give up and return to town withtheir tails between their legs, but alive and the wiser for it.Some like McCandless, show up in Alaska, unprepared, unskilled and unwilling to takethe time to learn the skills they need to be successful. These quickly get in trouble andeither die by bears, by drowning, by freezing or they are rescued by park rangers or otherrescue personnel-but often, not before risking their lives and/or spending a lot ofgovernment money on helicopters and overtime.When you consider McCandless from my perspective, you quickly see that what he didwasn't even particularly daring, just stupid, tragic and inconsiderate. First off, he spentvery little time learning how to actually live in the wild. He arrived at the Stampede Trailwithout even a map of the area. If he had a good map he could have walked out of hispredicament using one of several routes that could have been successful. Consider wherehe died. An abandoned bus. How did it get there? On a trail. If the bus could get intothe place where it died, why couldn't McCandless get out of the place where he died?The fact that he had to live in an old bus in the first place tells you a lot. Why didn't hehave an adequate shelter from the beginning? What would he have done if he hadn'tfound the bus? A bag of rice and a sleeping bag do not constitute adequate gear andprovisions for a long stay in the wilderness.No experienced backcountry person would travel during the month of April. It is a timeof transition from winter's frozen rivers and hard packed snow with good travelingconditions into spring's quagmire of mud and raging waters where even small creeksbecome impassible. Hungry bears come out of their dens with just one thing in mind--eating.Furthermore, Chris McCandless poached a moose and then wasted it. He killed amagnificent animal superbly conditioned to survive the rigors of the Alaskan wild then,inexperienced in how to preserve meat without refrigeration (the Eskimos and Indians doit to this day), he watched 1500 pounds of meat rot away in front of him. He's lucky thestench didn't bring a grizzly bear to end his suffering earlier. And in the end, the moosedied for nothing.So what made the difference between McCandless and I fourteen years ago? Why am Ialive and he is dead? Essentially, Chris McCandless committed suicide while Iapprenticed myself to a career and a life that I wanted more badly than I can possiblydescribe in so short an essay. In the end I believe that the difference between us was thatI wanted to live and Chris McCandless wanted to die (whether he realized it or not). Thefact that he died in a compelling way doesn't change that outcome. He might have madeit work if he had respected the wilderness he was purported to have loved. But it is mybelief that surviving in the wilderness is not what he had in mind.I did not start this essay to trash poor Chris McCandless. Not intentionally. It is sad thatthe boy had to die. The tragedy is that McCandless more than likely was suffering frommental illness and didn't have to end his life the way he did. The fact that he choseAlaska's wildlands to do it in speaks more to the fact that it makes a good story than tothe fact that McCandless was heroic or somehow extraordinary. In the end, he was sadlyordinary in his disrespect for the land, the animals, the history, and the self-sufficiencyethos of Alaska, the Last Frontier.6.13.08: Comment by Catherine Todd on the comments:I just now saw all these comments from where I had originally posted this in the ""review"" section. I had no idea posting an actual letter from an Alaskan Park Ranger would elicit such a overwhelming response. I agree wholeheartedly with the ranger, having had some wilderness experience but not enough to ever attempt to ""go it alone"" in Alaska or elsewhere.Being a Girl Scout and in the Boy Scouts too (when they would let me!) showed me how much I ""didn't know."" Living up in the mountains in Colorado for a winter's season when I was 18 years old, and being lucky enough to hike out in the snow by myself - when I ran out of food & firewood - and find my way to town - showed me how much experience is really required. I could have died up there and wouldn't have been found until the Spring thaw. Just like in the old-time books and Western movies.There is nothing ""romantic"" about the ""Jeremiah Johnson"" life, no matter how good it looks on film. This film showed that, to me. I'm going to post the Ranger's letter in a discussion area here on Amazon, where it probably belonged in the first place. Thanks for all the comments. Boy, am I surprised! But I absolutely LOVED reading the Alaskan Ranger's Letter (written by Ranger Peter Christian). He knows what he is talking about, ""North South East & West, forward backwards over & under."" I hope I never have to ""get rescued,"" but if I do, let it be by him!Update April 14, 2010 Two years later: more comments on the comments:Reading all the comments about this review makes me wish, in part, that I hadn't posted the ranger's letter, no matter how on target it is. I am amazed that anyone could find fault with someone who is writing from EXPERIENCE. Here's my final comment I posted today, at the bottom of 6 pages of comments. I hope that Ranger Peter Christian knows how much I admire the work that he and countless others are doing to protect both our last remaining wildernesses, and our lives when we do go out there.People who seem to like criticizing the ranger who wrote the commentary, written from EXPERIENCE, might change their tune if they get trapped in the wilderness and have to be bailed out by guys like him. I for one am grateful that people like this are prepared, and do their job; what would we do without them?The ranger is saying that people need to BE PREPARED before they go out into the wilderness, as they endanger other people's lives when rescue teams have to go in to save them. It's no different than people who start forest fires inadvertently or through inattention; look at the damage they cause. These kind of people are dangerous, whether they mean to or not. TRAINING COUNTS. Doesn't anyone remember Boy Scout and Girl Scouts, where we learned a bit about how to survive in the wilderness before taking off on a trek?In many countries in the world, no one would even try to help; you just die in the wilderness and someone might one day find your bones.Hats off to the men and women who work in the field and save our skins and get little thanks for it. They deserve a medal, for sure.

1122936,A6DOCZ10B7JAJ,B000ZN802W,"C. Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere""","[1, 1]","""The circles they growand they swallow people whole""--Eddie Vedder_____________________________________________It is so easy in life to get wrapped up in our daily routines and comfortable habits.  INTO THE WILD is an inspirational story about a young man that broke the chains of conventional thinking and walked his own path.  I was expecting a basic, feel-good story that can't escape a certain level of foolish sentimentality.  But this journey is much more complex.It's the true story of Christopher McCandless, AKA Alexander Supertramp, a young man who abandoned his life of luxury in order to quench his thirst for adventure.  He was a college grad from a wealthy family, but just had different plans than those that were laid out for him.He donated his $25,000 savings to the hungry and embarked on his quest of fufillment in the wilderness.  Becoming one with nature.  His journey had one ultimate goal--Alaska.  He was ill-prepared to survive the harsh elements, having just his rifle and a field guide for edible plants.  Sound a little crazy?Well yes, it very well might be.  But Chris was an educated man, plus he had quite an infectious personality.  People seemed to be drawn toward his free spirit, which was evident in his numerous encounters along the way.So I doubt he was totally naive to the dangers his brave quest entailed.

1122937,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B000ZN802W,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[5, 8]","Into the Wild has been in my friend's DVD player for about a month. She has been watching it constantly. I finally got a chance to see for myself, and found it to be a fascinating and compelling story, based on a real person, who may have been tilting at windmills like Don Quixote in his quest for freedom and survival in the extremes of wild nature, but nevertheless, touched the lives of all he encountered along the way.Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) has just graduated from college, with excellent grades, but instead of either graduate school or a career, he chooses instead to go into the wild. He donates his trust fund to charity, burns his money, and abandons his car. He renames himself Alexander Supertramp, and begins his quest to live up to his new name. His parents, Walt and Billie McCandless (Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt) are bewildered and hire an investigator to find him, but to no avail. His sister Carine, who also serves as an additional narrator, is hurt that he doesn't call her, either. But she offers insight into what may have driven him off, comparing him to fine crystal that nevertheless is fragile and needs protection.Along the way he meets hippies Rainey & Jan Burres (Brian Dierker and Catherine Keener). Later, he works on a farm for Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughn). He also befriends lonely leather engraver Ron Franz (Hal Holbrook). He kayaks all the way to Mexico and back, rides the rails, visits Slab City in the desert, works in a fast food restaurant, always working towards his goal of surviving a harsh winter in the wilds of Alaska. He reaches Alaska and makes his final stand in an abandoned bus...Into the Wild was directed by Sean Penn. Great job, Sean. He waited 10 years to make the film, making sure that he had the approval and support of the McCandless family. Everything was filmed on location, and Sean Penn takes full advantage with excellent cinematography. Some of the cast were the actual people from the real life story, such as Jim Gallien, who gives the wanderer boots as he goes into the wild. Brian Deirker was originally hired as a technical consultant for the river rafting, but at Emile Hirsch's suggestion, cast in the role of hippie motorhomer Rainey.It features music composed and performed by Eddie Vedder. When Sean Penn called and asked him to do it, he agreed on the spot. I am not a fan of Pearl Jam, mainly because of Vedder's voice, which sounds phoney and cartoonish. But he has really matured, and there is just a touch of the cartoonishness in his voice to give it a bit of character and identity. The music is excellent, great acoustic guitar and the singing surprisingly good, it really adds to the film experience. Vedder does the bulk of the music, but there are also a few songs by Kaki King, some others, and of course we get to hear Roger Miller's ""King of the Road,"" which is paraphrased and quoted in the final manifesto.Besides the music, there are also quotes from literature on title cards between scenes, such as:There is a pleasure in the pathless woods(from Childe Harold, Canto iv, Verse 178)There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,There is a rapture on the lonely shore,There is society, where none intrudes,By the deep sea, and music in its roar:I love not man the less, but Nature more,-- Lord Byron, (George Gordon)The cast was all really good, with the well known actors and unknowns alike seeming totally authentic. I especially liked Vince Vaughn as someone who both mocks and admires the young man's ambitions. ""Can't be juggling blood and fire all the time!""Also there is a great encounter with Ron Franz (Hal Holbrook). The lonely old man looks askance at Supertramp's vagabond lifestyle, but considers his challenge to get out of his workshop and see the world. The encounter offers director Sean Penn a great chance for his protagonist to illustrate his saga by carving his story onto a leather belt:Ron Franz: What does the ""N"" stand for?Christopher McCandless: North.Ron Franz: [sounding surprised and frustrated] Alaska?Once he reaches Alaska, he continues carving out his story on a board he finds in the 'Magic Bus.'Christopher McCandless: Two years he walks the earth. No phone, no pool, no pets, no cigarettes. Ultimate freedom. An extremist. An aesthetic voyager whose home is the road. Escaped from Atlanta. Thou shalt not return, 'cause ""the West is the best."" And now after two rambling years comes the final and greatest adventure. The climactic battle to kill the false being within and victoriously conclude the spiritual pilgrimage. Ten days and nights of freight trains and hitchhiking bring him to the Great White North. No longer to be poisoned by civilization he flees, and walks alone upon the land to become lost in the wild. - Alexander Supertramp May 199210 movies that pertain to Into the WildAlpha Dog (Widescreen Edition)(2006) ....

1122938,ACVBZF3GK3O45,B000ZN802W,C. Davis,"[0, 1]","Bottom line: This is a good movie. Highly entertaining and I enjoyed watching it. This movie is an adventure story, albeit a very slow moving one with no explosions, and a story about lost potential. How the viewer defines that lost potential is more about the viewer then the story itself, but that is part of the appeal of this movie.First and foremost, this is a movie.  Not a documentary. Not a biography. If you want facts, then you should do what I have so far failed to do and get the book that the movie is loosely based on.However, if you want truth, the kind of truth based on human emotion, then this Sean Penn directed movie might be your cup of tea.""Into the Wild"" is especially moving because pretty much every able bodied boy has entertained, if only for a few seconds, the fantasy leaving the world and living in the wild. Of course, normally, family ties, the desire for material goods, and other interests, such as girls, keep this from being more than a passing fantasy.This is not to say that Chris McCandless, AKA Alexander Supertramp, is the perfect hero in this story. The way he turned his back on his family - especially his sister, the lack of adequate resources for his adventure in Alaska, and his inability to build long term relationships with others are very disconcerting.Also, to be completely honest, the way Chris McCandless lived was the life of a free loader. He isn't rejecting the modern world to live off the bounty of nature; he uses gas station bathrooms for water, churches and homeless shelters when necessary, and accepts the generosity of strangers. Culturally, this makes him a freeloader, as defined by anthropologists, not Webster's dictionary, in that he consistently uses more of society's resources then he generates. Given the state of most free land, abandoned military bases, Bureau of Land Management land, and National Forests/Parks, it probably isn't possible to live off the land in this day and age the way we think of Daniel Boone doing. Unless of course you are willing to occasionally trespass and/or use common resources that are really intended for paying customers and/or taxpayers. Even while in Alaska, Mr McCandless survives for as long as he did by hunting out of season.  Harmless, if one person does it (free loader), but if every hunter did it, hunting quickly becomes unsustainable and destroys whole species.On a side note, there is a whole subculture of folks that live full time on BLM campsites and places like Slab City. This movie does give the viewer a very brief - and probably idealized - look at this subculture. That subculture is not the focus of this movie, but is one of the more interesting parts.As other reviewers have pointed out, the sound track is quite good. In this reviewer's opinion, the sound track contributes quite a bit to the powerful emotions that this movie creates.This movie is way too long. Sean Penn obviously liked the subject matter and there was no one with the authority to edit it down to a more reasonable length.Many viewers, especially the ones that live and work in Alaska or around the edge of modern America's wilderness areas, are especially critical of Mr McCandless and this movie.  They may be correct in their criticisms, but miss the point that this movie is about the spiritual and emotional journey of one young man and how that journey is cut short just when he is on the cusp of transformation.Moreover, there are controversies about this movie. Did Mr McCandless poison himself on purpose or accidently? Did he simply starve?In any event, as much as I liked this movie, I don't think that I could watch it another time. At least, not any time soon, the movie is just too long and ends on in such a sad way.",4,Alexander Supertramp / Le Roy Vaga Bond,1372550400,"06 30, 2013",2013,3737,"['Bottom', 'line', 'good', 'movie', 'Highly', 'entertaining', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'adventure', 'story', 'very', 'slow', 'moving', 'one', 'explosions', 'story', 'lost', 'potential', 'How', 'viewer', 'lost', 'potential', 'more', 'viewer', 'then', 'story', 'part', 'appeal', 'movie.First', 'foremost', 'movie', 'Not', 'documentary', 'Not', 'biography', 'want', 'facts', 'then', 'should', 'do', 'what', 'have', 'so', 'far', 'failed', 'do', 'get', 'book', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'on.However', 'want', 'truth', 'kind', 'truth', 'based', 'human', 'emotion', 'then', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'directed', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'cup', 'tea', 'Wild', 'especially', 'moving', 'pretty', 'much', 'able', 'bodied', 'boy', 'entertained', 'only', 'few', 'seconds', 'fantasy', 'leaving', 'world', 'living', 'wild', 'course', 'normally', 'family', 'ties', 'desire', 'material', 'goods', 'other', 'interests', 'such', 'girls', 'keep', 'being', 'more', 'passing', 'fantasy.This', 'not', 'say', 'Chris', 'McCandless', 'AKA', 'Alexander', 'Supertramp', 'perfect', 'hero', 'story', 'way', 'turned', 'back', 'family', 'especially', 'sister', 'lack', 'adequate', 'resources', 'adventure', 'Alaska', 'inability', 'build', 'long', 'term', 'relationships', 'others', 'are', 'very', 'disconcerting.Also', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'way', 'Chris', 'McCandless', 'lived', 'was', 'life', 'free', 'loader', ""n't"", 'rejecting', 'modern', 'world', 'live', 'off', 'bounty', 'nature', 'gas', 'station', 'bathrooms', 'water', 'churches', 'homeless', 'shelters', 'when', 'necessary', 'generosity', 'strangers', 'Culturally', 'freeloader', 'defined', 'anthropologists', 'not', 'Webster', 'dictionary', 'consistently', 'more', 'society', 'resources', 'then', 'Given', 'state', 'most', 'free', 'land', 'abandoned', 'military', 'bases', 'Bureau', 'Land', 'Management', 'land', 'National', 'Forests/Parks', 'probably', ""n't"", 'possible', 'live', 'off', 'land', 'day', 'age', 'way', 'think', 'Daniel', 'Boone', 'doing', 'course', 'are', 'willing', 'occasionally', 'trespass', 'and/or', 'use', 'common', 'resources', 'are', 'really', 'intended', 'paying', 'customers', 'and/or', 'taxpayers', 'Even', 'Alaska', 'Mr', 'McCandless', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'hunting', 'season', 'Harmless', 'one', 'person', 'free', 'loader', 'hunter', 'did', 'hunting', 'quickly', 'unsustainable', 'destroys', 'whole', 'species.On', 'side', 'note', 'whole', 'subculture', 'folks', 'live', 'full', 'time', 'BLM', 'campsites', 'places', 'Slab', 'City', 'movie', 'give', 'viewer', 'very', 'brief', 'probably', 'idealized', 'look', 'subculture', 'subculture', 'not', 'focus', 'movie', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'parts.As', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'sound', 'track', 'quite', 'good', 'reviewer', 'opinion', 'sound', 'track', 'quite', 'bit', 'powerful', 'emotions', 'movie', 'creates.This', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'obviously', 'liked', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'one', 'authority', 'edit', 'down', 'more', 'reasonable', 'length.Many', 'viewers', 'especially', 'ones', 'live', 'work', 'Alaska', 'edge', 'modern', 'America', 'wilderness', 'areas', 'are', 'especially', 'critical', 'Mr', 'McCandless', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'correct', 'criticisms', 'miss', 'point', 'movie', 'spiritual', 'emotional', 'journey', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'how', 'journey', 'cut', 'short', 'just', 'when', 'cusp', 'transformation.Moreover', 'are', 'controversies', 'movie', 'Did', 'Mr', 'McCandless', 'poison', 'purpose', 'accidently', 'Did', 'simply', 'starve', 'event', 'as', 'much', 'liked', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'watch', 'time', 'least', 'not', 'time', 'soon', 'movie', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'such', 'sad', 'way']",N/A

1122940,AZ2QRRN8JXR6S,B000ZN802W,"Cesar ""juliomontoya2000""","[5, 9]","I was taken by surprise completely by this excellent movie. All the critical reviews were very good, but, even so, I expected some kind of light family entertainment (and that's exactly what you would expect if you ever watched the trailer, so don't get fooled by it).It was much much more, one of the most beautiful movies ever made, and very touching and moving. None of the 2007 movies produced the same effect, and had me thinking about what I watched even days afterwars.Here's a movie that has been ignored (in Hollywood's high places, not by the critics or the public). I don't know why. Is its message about nature and the place of man in it a little old-fashioned for Hollywood? Is violence a cooler topic? I don't know, maybe they're just ignoring director Sean Penn for being rebel and outspoken.This coming of age tale is a travel of self discovery, that has to do not only with nature itself, but equally with human nature. Through the experience of Chris McCandless (the real person that inspired the movie), we are faced with the question of how our relation with nature has to be. Maybe the biggest mistake of Christopher was to think that it demanded total detachment of social relationships, and in the end he may have learned a valuable lesson. And we become completely identified with his adventure.I really didn't expect this kind of movie from somebody like Sean Penn, whom I would associate more with political or controversial projects. This movie is a culmination of a labor of love of his, that took 10 years to finally see the light. I admire the great respect with which he treated the subject, because he leaves space for us to draw our own conclusions.Is it a little heavy handed? Maybe. Is McCandless portrayed as a ""too good to be true"" person?. Maybe in some instances. But none of this elements distracted me of the real deal here: we get the message through the EXPERIENCE of the character, not through his wisdom. We don't lose sight for a moment that he's an unexperienced youung man, even naive, someone that in the end gets a lesson the hard way. He's so blind that he doesn't realize that the interaction he had with other people while he was travelling was a clue to his search.If the message is heavy handed, for some, well, that was the way Sean Penn wanted to present Christopher's story. That doesn't diminish the story's merits.Emile Hirsh, as the main character, carries the movie really well. A physical combination between Jack Black (come on, look at his face) and Leo DiCaprio (his manners, his voice), he has made a breakthrough performance with this movie, and is one of the stars to pay attention to in the near future.Kudos also to Eddie Veder for his songs, so well placed into the movie. His merit is to have composed the songs, but Sean Penn, leaving space for them, has shown how sung music has to be inserted in a movie, a long lost art in movie making.I didn't find very much in the SPECIAL EDITION to justify its existence as a separate item.

Truthfully speaking though you can both like AND dislike certain qualities in a single individual, though you may like them in general, even admiring them - and McCandless is no exception here.To those who've seen 'Grizzly Man' there is no denying the emotional similarities of Chris McCandless and Timothy Treadwell. I won't go into great detail concerning Treadwell's story, suffice to say that Treadwell and McCandless both turned their backs (or wanted to) on society, which they both disdained as well. Both sought escape in the Alaskan wilderness, Treadwell at Katmai National Park, and McCandless in the Alaskan interior. Both displayed reckless behavior, and in the end died because of it! To be fair, of the two Treadwell is the most obviously nuts.Conversely McCandless seems like a relatively sane, immensely likable fellow, albeit extremely impulsive. Impulsiveness aside I had no problem with most of his adventures - until he crosses over into Alaska! At this point I have to ask myself how could a guy read Jack London and NOT be more respectful of the Alaskan wilderness? McCandless' decision to trek into the interior of Alaska with just the barest of necessities showed just how delusional this young man was. This guy thought he could somehow beat the odds with just a knife and a bic lighter, and lost! Like Treadwell, McCandless died an early, senseless, death. If there's any lessons to be learned here it's this: treat nature with respect! And be prepared!BTW to Mathew D. Burch who wrote:""I like how the ""armchair quarterbacks"" have passed judgement on Mr. Krakaur and Mr. McCandless. I highly doubt any of them have done anything that could even be remotely close to being outside their comfort zone, let alone their livingrooms.

After graduating from college, he adapts the moniker ""Alexander Supertramp"" and hits the road in search of self awareness and intense living. Raw wilderness is where he feels most at home as he tramps his way though the western United States and Mexico, places such as the Colorado River, Sea of Cortez and California desert. He builds several close friendships - with a South Dakota wheat farmer, an older hippie couple and an elderly man who has lost his family. But all these folks Alex eventually leaves behind to pursue his final destination - the Alaskan wilderness.I am from the same generation as Alex (born exactly 5 days earlier) and shared similar experiences and ideals as a young person. Like him, I rejected the materialism and careerism of modern America and set off on a series of travel adventures. Of course, I was never so brave and/or foolish as to try to live by myself in the Alaskan wilderness. But still I can relate to his story. Now, as a 39 year old, married and with a steady job, I watched this movie with a mixture of head nodding and head shaking. Alex was selfish, arrogant and naive in many ways. But I still felt a sense of admiration for his courage, energy and spiritual longing. He wasn't willing to settle for the mediocrity of mainstream normality. But instead followed a path close to nature, as Henry David Thoreau, Jack London and others did in an earlier age. His was a uniquely American adventure and, whether wise or foolish, Alex certainly sought to live life to its fullest.This movie has fine acting, beautiful cinematography of gorgeous natural landscapes and a great soundtrack by Eddie Vedder.

The young often go on 'seeking' quests, full of the normal human debates going on inside them, often urging them 'into the wild'.

I also believe he forgave them for their imperfections. It's heartbreaking to watch this movie, but I was so touched by it that I thank the family for allowing it to be told.

It's not so much wanting to be ""free"" and live life without barriers but rather to get out there and see as much as you can before you settle into a life like everyone else has. The film, based on the book of the same name, tells the story of one who wanted to be free and not dragged down by materialism and unnecessary things without realizing the most important things at the same time.The film tells the story of Christopher McCandless, a smart man recently graduated from university where he longs for a life that's more basic and natural than new cars and careers. After donating all of his rather extensive savings and burning the rest, abandoning his car and changing his name to ""Alexander Supertramp"", he goes on a 2 year journey that takes him all over America before he makes for his goal of Alaska where he spends his days in an abandoned bus and where his body was later found.One thing that always bugs me about these ""biopics"" is that the film casts the subject in such a positive light that anything negative gets dismissed or at least excused because of their ""genius and influence"". While I can relate to the idea of just wanting to live and not be saddled by getting a job so I can move out so I can get to university and work 20 years for a job I don't love, his reasonings and viewpoints are a little bit naive even. In one scene after being told to get a career, he says no because it's a ""20th century invention"" which to me sounds more like rebellion against The Man rather than something he felt his soul/spirit needed. So it's more a story you can appreciate and maybe even get inspired by but it's not let's say Gandhi in its power.The film though is quite gorgeous in how it was shot and a lot of its cinematography is quite picturesque and helps sell the idea of just being out there on your own. The music, supplied by Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, is also a notable mention and it wasn't as intrusive or wrong as I thought it was going to be. Another praise I got to give is to Sean Penn who, to be honest, I never liked as an actor, preferring loudness and overexaggerated movements to help sell his character. But as a director here, he's more restrained and even has a good sense of pacing which for some reason is a big problem with some directors lately.Like Zodiac and the Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Into the Wild was criminally overlooked by the Academy and proves not all the best films get to be the top 5 nominated.

1122955,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B000ZN802W,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[14, 31]","How did the bus get there? Of all the questions (pseudo and real) that Sean Penn's latest film, Into The Wild, is so manifestly trying to provoke- and in a semi-retarded hippy-cum-tree hugger sort of way, this most basic and elemental plot point is never addressed. But, more on that later.The film is based upon the 1996 nonfiction bestseller by Jon Krakauer, about a spoiled rich white suburban boy who basically commits suicide in the Alaskan wilderness, although he is so painfully unaware of the real world that he does not even know his own dark- almost Objectivist, impulses, and where they will lead. The book the film is based upon was a good read, even if one might question the wisdom of making a martyr out of such a delusional narcissist as Christopher Johnson McCandless (Emile Hirsch)- the 24 year old who starved to death on the aforementioned bus, after accidentally poisoning himself with inedible berries, in the middle of Alaska's wilds, after adopting the pseudonym Alexander Supertramp.The lead character is simply annoyingly repellant- perhaps only Roberto Benigni's lead character, Guido, in the awful Life Is Beautiful, makes a viewer more actively root for the character's death. In that film the lead character is so annoying that one actually roots for the Nazis to kill him, and in this film McCandless is so pompous and the film so long (140 minutes, compared to a book barely over 200 pages) that, at the hour mark, one wishes he'd just die already, so one can vacate the theater. But, no relief will come for over an hour. But, as repellant as Chris McCandless, the character, is, the direction by Sean Penn- in his first truly big budget feature, is ATROCIOUS! Yes, Penn is a great actor, but his direction, and even worse screenplay, make this film a chore. Only some stellar acting, mostly by supporting actors, saves this film from total disaster.... That so many people identify and sympathize with this unfortunately deluded and hollow young loser bespeaks how little they even notice themselves, and their own flaws, much less the many other McCandlesses that proliferate in cafes across the nation. Life is as real, both for the good and ill, in a New York City deli, a doctor's waiting room, or in a tenement, as it is on the peak of Mount Everest, riding the tube of a forty foot wave in Hawaii, or trekking through the Amazon. McCandless never learned this for no one seemed to care enough to even try to stop him. Of course, even had they, he was so selfish and uncaring of others' feelings, that he likely would not have been deterred. And, Penn would likely not have cared to make a film about such a character, anyway.So, given the predetermined mess of this film, I return to the opening query- how did the bus, which the film refers to as `magic'- thank you to The Who, get there? A Google search reveals the bus was fortuitously left by a highway construction company, decades earlier, to be used as a waystation for hikers, hunters, and campers. Since everything else in this film is so obvious, I just thought you'd want to know that and, also, to avoid this film.

But I think that he died happy. I think had he taken the more practical approach and accept the confines of what modern life offers, he would've ended up leading a miserable life. Sometimes, one has to look through the eyes of the person seeking their quest to fully understand and appreciate what they would consider a success, and not simply to look at it through the eyes of practicality.

After graduating from Emory University in Atlanta, McCandless gave away his savings of $24,000 to OXFAM, burned the last few bills in his wallet, left his wealthy family without a word, and then found his way to the Alaskan wilderness after bumming his way across the country and giving himself a new name, ""Alexander Supertramp."" His body was eventually found by some moose hunters in an abandoned bus in remote Alaska, along with some books and notes, where he either starved to death or poisoned himself by accidentally eating toxic plants. This film is long at 145 minutes, and at times Penn romanticizes McCandless as the hero who rejects the evils of society. He was also a confused young man acting out his anger against his dysfunctional parents. This is a good film about a fascinating story that has continued to garner controversy and attention since Krakauer made it famous.

1122961,A1E9QU27DMFRGS,B000ZN802W,Danielle Turchiano,"[2, 4]","Usually when a film is adapted from a literature counterpart, something major gets lost in the translation: details have to be left out to account for time and pacing, and in doing so, the inner workings of the characters are often lost, left only between the pages of the original format.  Jon Krakauer's novel version of Into The Wild is one such broad case, focusing not only on the lost and somewhat troubled young man that was Chris McCandless, but also the author's own relation to similar feelings of displacement.  It became a muddled justification of youthful angst and the extreme actions one might take to rid himself of such feelings to find a place in this world, and many readers came away from the book writing McCandless off as an overindulged kook.  Thankfully, though, Sean Penn's adaptation cuts out all of Krakauer's commentary and focuses solely on McCandless (Emile Hirsch)'s journey--both the physical, as the settings become characters within themselves, as well as the spiritual and emotional, and in doing so, he allows the audience to get under the man's skin in such a way one can't help but be moved.  No one is just sitting and waiting for McCandless to ""come to his senses"" and just go home in Penn's version because he passes no judgment on his protagonist.  In Into The Wild; Penn treats McCandless how the real life inspiration longed to be treated: he just lets him be, and in turn he is able to craft a tragically painful true story into a thing of extraordinary beauty, both in message in addition to imagery.Penn and Hirsch both seem to ""get"" McCandless in a way Krakauer tried to convince himself (and his readers) that he did when he was actually quite far from true empathy.  From the short glimpse of his well-to-do home life and the subsequent narration by his sister (Jena Malone), this dynamic duo sets out on their own journey to explain just why a young man with the world at his feet would abandon it (identification, map, and all) in search for the unknown.  Into The Wild is a celebratory tribute to a man who unfortunately, through all of his courage, never found the comfort of carving out his own place in the world.Don't be fooled by the ""man alone in the wilderness"" angle of Into The Wild; the film is not another Castaway by any means.  While there are definite moments where Hirsch is forced to only act off the trees, rapids, and mountains around him, the most poignant scenes come from his interaction with the few stragglers he meets along his way.  Hirsch is a method actor if there ever was one; he went as far as to lose forty pounds of his already lean frame to accurately depict McCandless' physical features as his journey took its toll on him.  He emotes with the same intensity, his face betraying the rugged outdoorsman persona he put on and instead exhibiting the inner sheer desperation he felt deep down inside to make a connection--even a slight one--with those he encounters.  The sadness on Hirsch's face reads loud and clear in these moments--most notably apparent in scenes opposite widow Ron (Hal Holbrook) and teenage Tracy (Kristen Stewart)-- and plays almost as a commentary on what it takes for some to be happy.  It is ironic then that he acts as such a source of wisdom and enlightenment to all of his new friends.Hirsch's expressiveness is enhanced by DP Eric Gautier's hauntingly picturesque frames, where the scenery is crisp enough to fool the audience into thinking they, too, can take a deep breath and smell fresh pine air or get hit by a spray of cold white water.  The coupling also serves to capture the harsh oxymoronic nature of a world that is both cold yet majestic and of which McCandless both yearns to be a part yet simultaneously abhors.  It is hard for anyone who has experienced even the slight disenfranchisement of monotonous routine not to feel a deep connection to the way in which Hirsch's McCandless carries himself.  On one hand, he is one part youthful optimist, dreaming of an escape from rigid boundaries placed on him just for being born into the situation that he was; but on the other hand, he is mature beyond his years, having learned that no matter how far you run away or with who or what you surround yourself, you may still be overwhelmed by an unsettling feeling of being alone.",5,"Not Another ""Castaway""...",1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,4303,"['Usually', 'when', 'film', 'adapted', 'literature', 'counterpart', 'something', 'major', 'lost', 'translation', 'details', 'have', 'be', 'left', 'out', 'account', 'time', 'pacing', 'doing', 'so', 'inner', 'workings', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'lost', 'left', 'only', 'pages', 'original', 'format', 'Jon', 'Krakauer', 'novel', 'version', 'Into', 'Wild', 'one', 'such', 'broad', 'case', 'focusing', 'not', 'only', 'lost', 'somewhat', 'troubled', 'young', 'man', 'was', 'Chris', 'McCandless', 'also', 'author', 'own', 'relation', 'similar', 'feelings', 'displacement', 'became', 'muddled', 'justification', 'youthful', 'angst', 'extreme', 'actions', 'one', 'might', 'take', 'rid', 'such', 'feelings', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'many', 'readers', 'came', 'away', 'book', 'writing', 'McCandless', 'off', 'overindulged', 'kook', 'Thankfully', 'though', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'adaptation', 'out', 'Krakauer', 'commentary', 'solely', 'McCandless', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'journey', 'physical', 'settings', 'become', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'spiritual', 'emotional', 'doing', 'so', 'audience', 'get', 'man', 'skin', 'such', 'way', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'moved', 'one', 'just', 'sitting', 'waiting', 'McCandless', 'come', 'senses', 'just', 'go', 'home', 'Penn', 'version', 'judgment', 'protagonist', 'Into', 'Wild', 'Penn', 'McCandless', 'how', 'real', 'life', 'inspiration', 'longed', 'be', 'treated', 'just', 'be', 'turn', 'able', 'craft', 'tragically', 'painful', 'true', 'story', 'thing', 'extraordinary', 'beauty', 'message', 'addition', 'imagery.Penn', 'Hirsch', 'seem', 'get', 'McCandless', 'way', 'Krakauer', 'tried', 'convince', 'readers', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'far', 'true', 'empathy', 'short', 'glimpse', 'well-to-do', 'home', 'life', 'subsequent', 'narration', 'sister', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'dynamic', 'duo', 'out', 'own', 'journey', 'explain', 'just', 'why', 'young', 'man', 'world', 'feet', 'would', 'abandon', 'identification', 'map', 'search', 'unknown', 'Wild', 'celebratory', 'tribute', 'man', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'courage', 'never', 'found', 'comfort', 'carving', 'out', 'own', 'place', 'world.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'man', 'alone', 'wilderness', 'angle', 'Into', 'Wild', 'film', 'not', 'Castaway', 'means', 'are', 'definite', 'moments', 'where', 'Hirsch', 'forced', 'only', 'act', 'off', 'trees', 'rapids', 'mountains', 'most', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'come', 'interaction', 'few', 'stragglers', 'way', 'Hirsch', 'method', 'actor', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'went', 'as', 'far', 'lose', 'forty', 'pounds', 'already', 'lean', 'frame', 'accurately', 'depict', 'McCandless', 'physical', 'features', 'journey', 'took', 'toll', 'same', 'intensity', 'face', 'betraying', 'rugged', 'outdoorsman', 'persona', 'put', 'instead', 'exhibiting', 'inner', 'sheer', 'desperation', 'felt', 'deep', 'down', 'inside', 'make', 'connection', 'even', 'slight', 'one', 'sadness', 'Hirsch', 'face', 'loud', 'clear', 'moments', 'most', 'notably', 'apparent', 'scenes', 'opposite', 'widow', 'Ron', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'teenage', 'Tracy', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'almost', 'commentary', 'what', 'be', 'happy', 'ironic', 'then', 'such', 'source', 'wisdom', 'enlightenment', 'new', 'friends.Hirsch', 'expressiveness', 'enhanced', 'DP', 'Eric', 'Gautier', 'hauntingly', 'picturesque', 'frames', 'where', 'scenery', 'crisp', 'enough', 'fool', 'audience', 'thinking', 'too', 'can', 'take', 'deep', 'breath', 'smell', 'fresh', 'pine', 'air', 'get', 'hit', 'spray', 'cold', 'white', 'water', 'coupling', 'also', 'capture', 'harsh', 'oxymoronic', 'nature', 'world', 'cold', 'yet', 'majestic', 'McCandless', 'yearns', 'be', 'part', 'yet', 'simultaneously', 'abhors', 'hard', 'anyone', 'who', 'experienced', 'even', 'slight', 'disenfranchisement', 'monotonous', 'routine', 'not', 'feel', 'deep', 'connection', 'way', 'Hirsch', 'McCandless', 'one', 'hand', 'one', 'part', 'youthful', 'optimist', 'dreaming', 'escape', 'rigid', 'boundaries', 'placed', 'just', 'being', 'born', 'situation', 'was', 'other', 'hand', 'mature', 'years', 'having', 'learned', 'matter', 'how', 'far', 'run', 'away', 'who', 'what', 'surround', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'overwhelmed', 'unsettling', 'feeling', 'being', 'alone']",N/A

1122967,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B000ZN802W,Dennis Littrell,"[3, 7]","But don't make a mistake.The theme of this emotionally wrenching drama (script and direction from Sean Penn, from a best-selling nonfiction book by Jon Krakauer) is not man versus wild, as it was in the works of one of the protagonist's heroes, Jack London.  Instead the conflict is between man and society.  Chris McCandless has just graduated from college.  His parents are proud.  His grades are good enough for a top grad school.  He's bright, personable.  It seems he has everything going for him.But he's bitter and disappointed.  He disrespects his parents and believes that the last thing he wants to do is act out their idea of success.  So he gives the $24,000 he has in the bank for grad school to charity and just ups and leaves home.  He has some Kerouac-like adventures on the road where as a ""leather tramp"" he meets some ordinary people, some good people, some retro hippies, some Middle American farm workers, some derelicts and a social worker in L.A., a pretty girl, an old man, etc., and then, believing ""you don't need human relationships to be happy,"" it's north to Alaska to live out a dream that might have been dreamt by Thoreau or Jack London.But we know from the very beginning of the film that Chris McCandless AKA ""Alexander Supertramp"" will die in the Alaskan wilderness at a tender age in 1992.  Was his death the result of stupidity regarding the dangers of going ""into the wild"" or was it a result of bad luck or accident?  Or was it the indirect result of the hypocritical and mercantile values of his parents and his society to which he overreacted?  Or even, was it the indirect result of a kind of youthful bravado that could overtake many a young man?What Chris does is what a renunciant in an Eastern religion might do: he leaves society to live alone in the woods.  He renounces society's shallow values and lives as simply as possible.  But Chris is not practicing an Eastern religion.  He is not an old man near the end of his life looking for moksha.  He is under the influence of Thoreau and Jack London, whose books he has read and loved.  He wants to test himself against the wild without help from anyone.  He wants to prove his manhood to himself without the help of society or society's culture.But he is a greenhorn in the Alaskan wilderness whose fate is sealed.The way that Jon Krakauer and Sean Penn have reconstructed this story (partly from notes and even from some carvings that Chris made, and partly from interviews with people who knew Chris) we see that at one point after some weeks in the wilderness Chris suddenly realizes something profound and moving.  He says, referring to the great beauty of life and the world that he is able to see: ""Happiness is only real when it's shared..""  At that point he has learned what he needed to learn from the wilderness and from the people he met in his trek across the country.The great tragedy of this movie is what then befalls Chris.The ending is emotionally gut-retching and yet somehow cathartic.  To watch such a likeable, honest and spiritually advanced young man with such potential seem to throw it all away, carelessly, foolishly, or accidently, is a human tragedy brilliantly brought to the printed page and to the screen for all of us to share.  And in this sharing Chris's life gains new meaning and he becomes a guide and a teacher for all of us.I know it must have been very difficult for his parents to cooperate in the telling of Chris's story since the story does not show them in a favorable light.  Yet the very fact that they helped bring Chris's story to us shows perhaps where Chris got his moral courage.  I have no doubt that it was their deep love for their son that moved them to find that emotional courage.  This movie gives meaning to Chris's life and shows their love for him, and allows a wide audience to see that he did not die in vain.I want to congratulate not only Krakauer and Penn but also Emile Hirsch who played the part of Chris McCandless.  The role was enormously demanding, the sort of role that an actor may only get once in a lifetime, if he's lucky.  And Hirsch played it well.  He was charming and witty and very strong of character.  What a splendid tribute to the real Chris.  And kudos to Hal Holbrook who played Ron Krantz to an emotional tee, deeply sympathetic to both his character and to Chris's, and to the significance of the film itself.And the rest of the cast was also very good, although Kristen Stewart was a little too pretty for the part of the 16-year-old trailer troubadour, and of course William Hurt could have used a larger role.The lesson of this story, it seems to me is this: Young people of courage and honor, even though they may make mistakes, even though they may be mistaken at a fundamental level, can, through their valor, teach us all something important.  As Chris told Ron Krantz, ""Get off your butt, old man.  The core of a man's spirit comes from new experiences.""  What he is also saying is: live every moment in a genuine way.  And we can see that is what Chris did.  A life so lived, although short, may well be the equal of a much longer life lived not so authentically.",5,Call everything by its proper name,1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,5162,"['do', ""n't"",

I completely disagree with the way he treated his parents as well, he was just a total brat, however I can and do understand his reaction IF what he was saying about his parents was true.  But I again go back to my original question, what did his sister do to him?***SPOILER WARNING*****In the end he should have just died when his car was hit with the flood.  His parent's would have mourned his loss anyway and been effected the same way without a moose having to give up its life later for absolutely nothing.UPDATED review July 3, 2011 - I saw this movie again last night in my pastor's house with a group and we discussed it afterward.  I must say that seeing it a second time several years later and having children of my own at that age, I have definitely softened my view of the movie and of Chris as well. My original review had everything to do with his callousness and disregard he had for his family and in particular to his sister which I still maintain.  He spoke about all of the damage people do to each other yet seemed to fail to see the damage he himself was doing.  Ultimately he was still just a kid with a lot to learn. He complained about all of the hypocrisy in the world and the hurt that people do to each other, yet other than being beat up after being taken off a train, he was treated well and shown kindness along his journey by ""people"". He was abused (mostly by seeing his mother physically and mentally abused) which was confirmed by his sister - so it wasn't as if he made all of that up. I never had an issue with his choice to get away from it all or to put himself in danger - he has that right and I don't think it was ever his intention to get himself killed.  He wasn't as prepared as he should have been, though his death was still more of an ""accident"" than anything else.

At first preachy and morose, there's a tipping point early in the picture where I couldn't help but feel something for McCandless and his naive quest to subsist wholly on morals, philosophy and the kindness of strangers in place of tangible food and water. Presented as a sort of messiah figure, the errant youth touches the lives of a broad range of individuals over the course of his travels, preaches the gospel of live-and-let-live and uncovers the difficulties associated with the tramp's lifestyle in a society so concerned with protecting its citizenry from themselves. There's a lot to be learned from Christopher's path, both positive and negative, and Penn shies away from neither in this careful, convincing pseudo-documentary. It can be so enveloping at times that the sudden appearance of a recognizable actor or two along the way feels awkward and strange.

I am down with the nay sayers who say the film lacked this or that or whatever word stock and bantering, boring, 'streamlined' prose they want to use. The songs were so perfect for the settings they were in, and Vedder's voice added to the overall impact of the outcome of the film, just littered with emotions, and the sweeping lucid cinematography that we were welcomed to ignited the viewer to want to walkabout almost immediately. The songs were searing! The very close and introspective views of nature, instead from long angled shots were truly well done. Also the physical change in Hirsh was brilliant, especially at the end there when he took his shirt off in one of the scenes and to see the transformation from him a bit o' baby fat throughout, then eating organic and of course his eventually demise where he ate the wrong plant, was very well done, and I was having flashbacks to Bale in 'The Machinist' for a bit, albeit not as grotesque.Bill Hurt is always brilliant. I love his voice, his presence, there is just something about him ya know, something intrinsic that he just has a way with the ensemble he works with. To not say that Chris also had some mental instability, arguably would be doing the film an injustice, and I think Penn really brought that out in some scenes where Hirsh's mind was just littered with ideas, idealisms, and a million thoughts screaming out in the dark. Through all Chris's pure love of the wild, he must in turn have been screaming inside.In a time where films seem to lack anymore creativity in a tangible sense, 'Into the Wild' comes from nowhere and lands a punch on our hearts, and for me at least, it is surely needed in a time when we all seem to be searching for something more. In saying that I am reminded by a few lines I remembered from my youth, and I apologize for any inaccuracies as its from memory: ""Nature gives you the impressions as if there were nothing else contradictory in the world; and yet, when you return back to the dwelling place of man, be it lofty or low, wide or narrow, there is ever somewhat to contend with, to battle with, to smooth and put to rights"" [Goethe]And in that we find Chris McCandless.

I can greatly sympathize both with this man and with Bickle's character.

What I am struck by, however, is the perhaps unintentional layering of Penn's generational angst onto Chris McCandless.  They both came of age in an era where too much attention was given to their emotions by their parents and extended family.  Over time, this generation came to imagine their hurts, pains and emotions were more and greater than others.  I know that is somewhat true of Penn, and he has pasted that over McCandless.  We don't know McCandless well enough to trust that interpretation.  I think Sean Penn admired McCandless's willingness to throw himself into situations he didn't know he could handle, and so he glorified that.  McCandless was looking for adventure, and he found one, although not with the ending he imagined.  I don't think movie directors do the viewing public any justice when they change facts and personalities to make a better movie.  Whether or not Penn meant to portray McCandless as slightly touched, perhaps mentally ill, I was frequently left with that impression.  I also was left with the impression of a spoiled wealthy child who took his own emotions too seriously.  As did all of his family, according to this film.  If we use this film to ""know"" McCandless, he also comes across as naive, simplistic, and reckless, as well as someone who arrogantly overestimates his own abilities.  I, for one, would never have shot that moose without having a fire pit waiting and ready with an ample supply of wood.  While the storyline is interesting, as presented, and the photography beautiful, I am uneasy with the creative license Penn took with the life-and death-of a real human being.

Based on Jon Krakauer's reconstruction of McCandless' journey from his diary, from letters, and from notes found after his death at age 23, IN THE WILD has been transformed into a Waldenesque film by Sean Penn who provided both the screenplay and the direction.  While some may argue the very loose technique of relating this story, few will come away form this film untouched by the sheer dreamy valor of a youth determined to find his own connection to the meaning of existence.The bright McCandless (Emile Hirsch) graduates from Emory University and faces a celebratory dinner with his wealthy but dysfunctional parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) and his adoring younger sister Carine (Jena Malone).  During the stilted and revealing dinner Christopher declines his parents' gift of a new car and instructions on how to proceed with his life of success, instead electing to leave it all behind and secretly set off on a personal journey to live in the wild. Stripping himself of worldly possessions he begins his road trip with the ultimate destination being Alaska. Along the way he encounters various people: Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughan) who offers him work harvesting grain and camaraderie; Jan and Rainey (Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker), two middle-aged hippies who offer him a sense of family; Tracy (Kristen Stewart), a 16-year old who offers him physical love Christopher cannot condone; a Danish couple he encounters while rafting; and the elderly Frank (Hal Holbrook) who has no family and lives alone making leather trinkets, eager to 'belong' to the young man whom he sees as needy yet courageous.Christopher's journey pretty much covers America and Mexico, from the plains and farms to the homeless streets of Los Angeles to the splendors and natural cruelties of nature in Alaska.  His struggles survive are balanced by his inebriation with the wonders of the natural world untouched by society. Yet in the end he faces his own dissolution into the dust of nature alone.Hirsch immerses himself in this physically demanding role and manages to hold onto our hearts all through his journey.  The flow of the story is at times discordant with the over voice narration by Jena Malone and the insertion of bits and pieces of quotations that aren't pieced tightly together enough to avoid sounding superficial.  Yet the supporting cast is very strong, including a brilliant little cameo by Cheryl Francis Harrington as a social worker with heart.  The photography (Eric Gautier) is stunning and the musical score, courtesy of Michael Brook, Kaki King, and Eddie Vedder, fits the mood through the film. And throughout the film Sean Penn has the restraint and taste to keep the story vital without ever making it maudlin.  A very fine film.

There is a nagging doubt that underneath this nature loving idealist, who disappears without a trace to embark on his adventure,  lies a malice aimed at his concerned family who live in grief for years unknowing of his whereabouts and fate.In fact, Penn's inistence to include the McCandless family, (professional, upper-scale, worried sick about their missing son), prominently in the narrative is a superflous reminder of the past when a few well chosen words of dialogue would prevail. We want the great Alaskan wilderness adventure, and while we get that, we also get a whole lot of generation gap family soap which is suspect to significance. Scenes like the cap-throwing college graduation do little but make this a very long movie.We feel for McCandless in much the same way we feel for ""Grizzly Man',the psycholgically leveraging photographer who also went into the Alaskan  wilderness, believing he could commune with the wild bears, but instead was eaten by them. Likewise McCandless had severe mental issues, that went beyond the call of the wild, in luring him to a wilderness camp where he was inept at hunting and eating wild game, unable to tell a poisonous plant from an edible one, and lived in an abandoned bus begging for a lead paint intolerance. Penn's god-like vistas of the great wilderness are in innoculated contrast to the frail, doomed, self renamed Alexander Supertramp.I expected to love this movie, and while I never even disliked it, (it's a cabin in the woods thing), in retrospect, the haunting image of the real McCandless at the end of the film, leaves him a sad and nearly pathetic man. Is this the intention of the film? To wonder what he was really running away from? When I was 19, I packed a bag and walked and hitchhiked the continental U.S. from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. I too was looking for something but I trust it was not a desire to become a second-rate Thoreau. The film refuses to speculate on where McCandless' intention lied, or where his pain began. It has however conjured in me an absolute respect for him.

And there is even less wrong with the desire to articulate and express the realities of such a search, especially when derived from genuine experience and events. But Mr. Penn's film actually addresses none of this.First, consider the issue of form: Is this story better told as a documentary or as drama?  My vote would be documentary, a vote that surely truncates the potential audience and, from a purely subjective perspective, severely curtails the rampant scale for creative self-indulgence on display in every aspect of this movie. And second, consider that the choice to use drama here ends up borrowing so heavily from the visual language of soft drink advertising: vast nature as witness to the thrown back head and widespread arms of momentary human exultation derived from what? Carbonation? Freedom? Who can tell? And after a more than two hour torrent of such clich&eacute;s, who could care? And still, that image and gesture -- amid some of the dumbest directing and gratuitous stylistic gestures I've seen in a long time -- are as close as the movie comes to providing any acknowledgment of life elsewhere, let alone any understanding of the promise of ""escape"" and its unsurprising shortfall.Since the details of the actual events are so scant anyone taking up this story will be reasonably expected to acknowledge its fundamental unknowability, or to (responsibly and consistently) fill in the fine points. When, near the end, the narrator tells us that the story can now only be told by its principal character Penn instead goes on to give us the whole cloth of a sunshiny family reunion-at-death, completing the movie's collapse into unadulterated kitsch. Penn clearly wants it both ways, through the experience of the man who lived it and through Sean's own fantasy interpretation. If nothing else, this is hugely sloppy and indulgent work. By trying to extract a happy end from an as-it-should-be unhappy ending, the audience is left not happy/sad but stupefied by club-fisted sentimentality and bleeding profusely of a million paper cuts from the purely Hallmarkian screenplay, left as the credits pass only able to acknowledge that the original meaning of ""bewildered"" -- to be lost in the wilderness -- remains the best and only meaning available.",2,FILMIC BEWILDERMENT,1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,2428,"['little', 'fault', 'individual', 'search', 'alternative', 'way', 'being', 'especially', 'context', 'consumer', 'culture', 'currently', 'inhabit', 'even', 'less', 'wrong', 'desire', 'articulate', 'express', 'realities', 'such', 'search', 'especially', 'when', 'derived', 'genuine', 'experience', 'events', 'Mr.', 'Penn', 'film', 'actually', 'none', 'this.First', 'consider', 'issue', 'form', 'story', 'better', 'told', 'documentary', 'drama', 'vote', 'would', 'be', 'documentary', 'vote', 'surely', 'potential', 'audience', 'purely', 'subjective', 'perspective', 'severely', 'rampant', 'scale', 'creative', 'self-indulgence', 'display', 'aspect', 'movie', 'second', 'consider', 'choice', 'use', 'drama', 'here', 'up', 'borrowing', 'so', 'heavily', 'visual', 'language', 'soft', 'drink', 'advertising', 'vast', 'nature', 'witness', 'thrown', 'back', 'head', 'widespread', 'arms', 'momentary', 'human', 'exultation', 'derived', 'what', 'Carbonation', 'Freedom', 'Who', 'can', 'tell', 'more', 'two', 'hour', 'torrent', 'such', 'clich', 'eacute', 'who', 'could', 'care', 'still', 'image', 'gesture', 'dumbest', 'directing', 'gratuitous', 'stylistic', 'gestures', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'are', 'as', 'close', 'movie', 'providing', 'acknowledgment', 'life', 'elsewhere', 'let', 'alone', 'understanding', 'promise', 'escape', 'unsurprising', 'shortfall.Since', 'details', 'actual', 'events', 'are', 'so', 'scant', 'anyone', 'taking', 'up', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'reasonably', 'expected', 'acknowledge', 'fundamental', 'unknowability', 'responsibly', 'consistently', 'fill', 'fine', 'points', 'When', 'end', 'narrator', 'story', 'can', 'now', 'only', 'be', 'told', 'principal', 'character', 'Penn', 'instead', 'give', 'whole', 'cloth', 'sunshiny', 'family', 'reunion-at-death', 'completing', 'movie', 'collapse', 'unadulterated', 'kitsch', 'Penn', 'clearly', 'ways', 'experience', 'man', 'who', 'lived', 'Sean', 'own', 'fantasy', 'interpretation', 'nothing', 'else', 'hugely', 'sloppy', 'indulgent', 'work', 'trying', 'extract', 'happy', 'end', 'as-it-should-be', 'unhappy', 'ending', 'audience', 'left', 'not', 'happy/sad', 'stupefied', 'club-fisted', 'sentimentality', 'bleeding', 'profusely', 'million', 'paper', 'cuts', 'purely', 'Hallmarkian', 'screenplay', 'left', 'credits', 'pass', 'only', 'able', 'acknowledge', 'original', 'meaning', 'bewildered', 'be', 'lost', 'wilderness', 'best', 'only', 'meaning', 'available']",N/A

He is the same guy who acted in the film, Fast Times at Ridgemont High as the indulgent youth with standout hair. Like you, I haven't watched half of the films I've been meaning to watch in 2007, so the fact that i watched this film was a big deal. It was Eddie Vedder's Society that piqued my interest. I watched this film five days back but it's one of those rare philandering seaking films, the relevance of which substantiates in days from first viewing.Into The Wild is not for all audiences but just like the man in the film, a 23 year old like me found it quite appealing in ways not quite comprehensible. To say the film is beautiful and profound would be apt. There are many scenes and locations which make me wonder how reading the book might have been. I like reading books but due to lack of an attention span and patience with one's self, I will never get around to reading this book.The film had flaws but it's only because this cynic won't let go that easily. I thought his reasons for being the way he is were showcased in a way not quite parallel than might have been true. I don't think it was the circumstances in his family that led him to be the way he was  but moreover, it was the unquestionable zeal for life in comradery one finds with nature that would egg him on.To all my fellow 23 year olds, watch this film.To all Eddie Vedder fans, check the soundtrack out.I'm now left wondering how I should update my boring sense of adventure.

The only thing I knew is that Sean Penn was directing and having been very impressed with his gut-wrenching, if incredibly downbeat,The PledgeI was pretty much guaranteed to like this film. My guess turned out to be extremely correct.Alexander Supertramp (that's Emile Hirsch as McCandless folks) is a man with no attachments. Having been raised in a loveless household by parents who only wish for him to 'or-din-ary' things he entertains them as far as graduating college but escapes to the country as soon as the diploma is in his hands.His dream is to explore the land with no ID, no money and no chance of being found by those who might want to interfere with his mission of reaching peaceful seclusion in a remote corner of Alaska. Along the way he touches many lives, some brief, some profound and gains experience and character that some might never have even if they lived to a hundred.Sean Penn's photography and affection for nature give this film an overall gorgeous look. It is surely one of the most uniquely composed films of the year. He reminds me a lot of Clint Eastwood as an actor who can also direct fine movies and encourage impressive performances out of his cast. Pretty much everybody here is on top form, even Vince Vaughn manages to shake off the taint of those tawdry 'frat pack' comedies and play a genuine character for once.But Hal Holbrook as old Ron Franz really is a standout. I've never seen a more heartfelt or touching performance in so long. It's a real shame he was conned out of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I think it's great that Sean Penn brought Holbrook (now 82) back for such an important and thought-provoking role. If you don't shed a tear for him then you have no soul.Don't con yourself out of a good movie. It may have a limited release but Into the Wild is a film worth taking time out to see.

He reaches a turning point in his historical approach of life. He depicts what 1968ers and hippies have become thirty years later, today, and what their idealism and ideals may produce today. Christopher, an allusion to a certain Christopher Columbus, decides to abandon everything, to give away his 24,000 dollars of savings, to burn his money and disappear in the vast territory known as the USA. He is looking for real life, for real nature, for real humanity, a life, a nature, a reality that are no longer simulacra of the truth, the truth that existed before man and humanity perverted it. So, along the road, he explores several possibilities that are all fake and he will end in Alaska. Sean Penn accumulates the elements showing there is no escape from society and civilization. No escape for the hippie couple Christopher becomes friendly to and who move freely thanks to their caravan, making an income along the way by selling second hand books they recuperate left and right. No escape from social norms in sex when Christopher refuses the approach and gift from a girl on the only basis that she is 16. Woodstock is really gone and forgotten. No escape in the friendship he develops with a farmer of some type who is finally caught up by the FBI for some illegal activity. No escape in the friendship he develops with an older retired GI who proposes to adopt him to provide him with some kind of a family, to provide himself with some kind of a substitute for his accidentally killed son. But no escape either in Alaska where he is trapped in a way three times, at least. Trapped in a bus that is grounded in the middle of the wilderness. Too easy to survive in this absolutely human environment whose engine is dead and has no fuel. Trapped by his forgetting that to survive in nature you have to know nature's cycle and he did not know the migration cycles of animals and found himself one day foodless, and he did not know the cycles of the rivers and found himself locked up by the water of the river and crossed on foot before. Trapped finally by his lack of knowledge about nature and by his lack of preparation that makes him mix up two wild plants, one edible and one inedible. And he dies slowly poisoned by wild sweet peas. And finally, but too late, he understands that happiness is only real when it is shared. But it is too late and he can only compensate his death with the beauty of the sky his dying eyes capture as he breathes out his very last breath of life. Complete, absolute, irreversible evolution of humanity from barbaric animality to necessarily social and shared civilization.

From Sean Penn's vision of how Christopher McCandless lives his life and searched for his goal, to Emile Hirsch's protrayal of the man's life, it's very compelling.As for the movie, Christopher (Hirsch) is a young man with the hubris of youth, the free-spirit of someone without responsibility, and the wherewithal of a privileged family.Because of a slightly dysfuncational family life, a strong disdain for much of what contemporary society has become - something with which I can strongly related, and the desire to find the aesthetic quality in every day life, Christopher leaves it all behind.  He eschews money (he actually sets fire to his last few remaining dollars), possession, and just about every other modern convenience in search ofAlong the way he changes his name to Alexander Supertramp in honor of not only the lifestyle but also his desire for anonymity.  His voyage to Alaska was full of adventure, finding random jobs, kayaking the entire Grand Canyon into Mexico, and meeting some interesting people along the way.Eventually he finds an abandoned school bus and calls it home.  It's just enough shelter for him to make it base-camp, where he can forage and hunt small game.  He spends the rest of the time reading, writing, and reflecting.The first major problem I have with this movie is the fact that he was so nice to so many, but had such an irrational hatred of his family.  I can understand his hesitancy to be close to his father, but he tortured his mother and sister out of pure ignorance and selfishness.The second problem I have with the movie is the message.  The majority of the film is a buildup, a message, an insight into his joy and freedom.  And then, in the end, the message changes.  Not only was his original concept foolhardy, but the lesson he learned was that he was completely wrong.  The essence of what he wanted to escape from was eventually the precise thing he craved.  It's easy to picture Alexander Supertramp as the free-wheeling, nature-loving, soul on a quest for enlightenment if he didn't end up looking like a utterly nave young man who lost his life unnecessarily.",4,"Great movie, two problems",1211155200,"05 19, 2008",2008,2205,"['First', 'foremost', 'scenery', 'story', 'acting', 'movie', 'top-notch', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'vision', 'how', 'Christopher', 'McCandless', 'life', 'searched', 'goal', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'protrayal', 'man', 'life', 'very', 'compelling.As', 'movie', 'Christopher', 'Hirsch', 'young', 'man', 'hubris', 'youth', 'free-spirit', 'someone', 'responsibility', 'wherewithal', 'privileged', 'family.Because', 'slightly', 'dysfuncational', 'family', 'life', 'strong', 'disdain', 'much', 'what', 'contemporary', 'society', 'become', 'something', 'can', 'strongly', 'related', 'desire', 'find', 'aesthetic', 'quality', 'day', 'life', 'Christopher', 'behind', 'money', 'actually', 'fire', 'last', 'few', 'remaining', 'dollars', 'possession', 'just', 'about', 'other', 'modern', 'convenience', 'search', 'way', 'name', 'Alexander', 'Supertramp', 'honor', 'not', 'only', 'lifestyle', 'also', 'desire', 'anonymity', 'voyage', 'Alaska', 'was', 'full', 'adventure', 'finding', 'random', 'jobs', 'kayaking', 'entire', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'Mexico', 'meeting', 'interesting', 'people', 'way.Eventually', 'abandoned', 'school', 'bus', 'home', 'just', 'enough', 'shelter', 'make', 'base-camp', 'where', 'can', 'forage', 'hunt', 'small', 'game', 'rest', 'time', 'reading', 'writing', 'reflecting.The', 'first', 'major', 'problem', 'have', 'movie', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'nice', 'so', 'many', 'had', 'irrational', 'hatred', 'family', 'can', 'understand', 'hesitancy', 'be', 'close', 'father', 'tortured', 'mother', 'sister', 'pure', 'ignorance', 'selfishness.The', 'second', 'problem', 'have', 'movie', 'message', 'majority', 'film', 'buildup', 'message', 'insight', 'joy', 'freedom', 'then', 'end', 'message', 'changes', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'original', 'concept', 'foolhardy', 'lesson', 'learned', 'was', 'was', 'completely', 'wrong', 'essence', 'what', 'wanted', 'escape', 'was', 'eventually', 'precise', 'thing', 'craved', 'easy', 'picture', 'Alexander', 'Supertramp', 'free-wheeling', 'nature-loving', 'soul', 'quest', 'enlightenment', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'looking', 'utterly', 'nave', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'life', 'unnecessarily']",N/A
1123018,AI8X8Y6KU7XXK,B000ZN802W,Jason Horsley,"[7, 11]","Based on Jon Krakauer's book about the true story of Chris McCandless, Sean Penn's Into the Wild is a powerful movie. As a writer-director, Penn has a way of cutting to the bone of his subject--he has an eye and ear that is almost unique in American movies, and he manages to be soulful without a trace of sentimentality (he gets away with lines that would turn to mush in anyone else's hands). There's a core of pathos to his film which I'm not sure I've ever seen before.This may be personal prejudice: the story of a young post-graduate student who gives up his inheritance and abandons a cozy life to wander across the US without a word to his family, and who ends up dying alone in the wilderness of Alaska, has special resonance for me because I did something similar, at almost the same age as McCandless. I didn't go to the wilds of Alaska and live in a bus--I went to Morocco and lived hand-to-mouth on the streets of Tangier--but the intent was the same: to get free from the suffocating context (and comforts) of a life that had defined me, and see what remained.Chris McCandless is played by Emile Hirsch, last seen as the despicable Johnny Truelove in Alpha Dog, and it's hard to imagine two more different roles. Hirsch has just the right qualities of strength and guilelessness here, the innocence and stubbornness that characterized McCandless. Chris is only interested in getting to the truth, whatever the cost in suffering (starting with his own: since his heart was broken, he has no qualms about breaking anyone else's). By the end of his journey (we know this because he kept a journal), he realizes that whatever truth or happiness he finds in the wild is meaningless without someone to share it with. His desire to connect to Nature and so come to know his own truth is incomplete without a connection to others. This may be the final truth that McCandless realized; in a way, it's the truth that killed him--or rather, that he had to die to discover.It's tempting to call Into the Wild a tragedy. It's devastatingly painful to watch and the tendency is to seek a word to encompass that pain. But I don't think it's true; Chris made a choice to live on his terms; if someone had asked him if he was willing to die for them, I have no doubt he would have said yes. He died doing exactly what he wanted to do, and where's the tragedy in that? If anything, Chris was an old-fashioned hero on a traditional quest for truth, but he was not a tragic hero. His ""flaw"" was in his naivet&eacute;, but this was inseparable from his integrity and vision: he knew he might die in Alaska but went anyway. He was prepared; it's just that his preparations weren't enough.It's been years since I read the book, but so far as I know (and by most accounts), the film sticks close to Krakauer's account, which was itself close to being an accurate report of Chris' journey. Yet Into the Wild has the strength and simplicity--the moral force--of a fable, and with any luck that's what audiences will respond to (those who don't reject Chris outright as ""selfish"" or arrogant and dismiss his death as meaningless). What Chris chose--to leave it all behind and return to the wilderness to find out what he was made of--is surely something any sensitive person in today's world can relate to. But it was more than a London-esque test of manhood or rite of passage (though it was certainly that), it was the searching of a poetic soul for meaning, of a highly sensitive and intelligent kid determined to strip away the layers that came between him and the truth, to remove all the masks and see what was behind them. In a way, Chris' death was testimony not to his own folly, his obsession, but to the world's failure to provide any meanings for Chris to believe in. The tragedy, then, is the tragedy of the world, a world represented by Chris' parents, who pay the ultimate price for their failure, which is their incapacity to love their son in a way that is truthful.If Chris unconsciously chose to die rather than to live in a world in which he found nothing--no values--worth living for, who can blame him? His death had more meaning than the life his parents wished for him ever could: it was at least his own meaning, his choice. As a writer and director, Sean Penn doesn't belabor any of this. He doesn't make the mistake of bringing the parable-like qualities of his tale to the surface. He focuses on the story and on bringing his characters to life, and lets the rest take care of itself; the metaphor is all the more powerful for being ""found"" rather than imposed. This is a true story, and what Penn has in common with his protagonist is an absolute commitment to--and an almost prodigious gift for--honesty. Scene for scene, I don't think there is a single false note in the movie, and though the film is long, there's nothing here that feels superfluous. All the characters bring something unique to the story; their presence serves to develop Chris as a character, giving him a context he would otherwise lack--their affection deepens him in our eyes. William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden as Chris's parents, Jena Malone as his sister, Vince Vaughn as his friend and employer Wayne, Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker as an aging hippie couple he rides with, Hal Holbrook as Ron Franz, Kristen Stewart, as the achingly beautiful teenage girl who takes Chris to Salvation mountain, all provide bittersweet memories--snapshots of the heart--that Chris takes with him into the wild.Penn occasionally overdoes his effects, most particularly his use of slow motion, and at times the film veers dangerously close to narcissism with imagery fit for aftershave commercials. And there are a couple of times when he borders on self-consciousness (such as when the old man Ron talks of God's light and the sun breaks through the clouds); but these are just glitches in an otherwise flawless tapestry. Into the Wild is a tour-de-force, and yet (besides these moments) it never seems to be working on getting an emotional reaction. Penn doesn't mess around; he gets his effects and moves on, his style is clean and confident--both poetic and prosaic at the same time. He lets the power of the images--and the emotional punch of the tale itself--carry the movie along. The film builds gradually, lyrically, with all the grace and tempo of an epic poem, into a devastating crescendo of imagery and a heartbreaking climax.The empathy Penn shows for his characters (inseparable from the actors), his affinity for everyday Middle America (the film is shot entirely on location, often in Chris' exact ""footprint,"" according to Penn), and the honesty and pathos of the film would be remarkable in any artist, but for someone once married to Madonna who has spent the past twenty-five years as a world famous movie star (Penn's breakthrough role was in Taps, at 21 years old), it's testimony to Penn's integrity as an artist that the film is almost entirely devoid of inauthentic touches or condescension. It seems to come directly from his heart to us.Into the Wild is an X-ray of the heart, showing all its intricacies and flaws, its longings and wounds. It draws a delicate yet raw portrait of the human condition honestly and compassionately, and it reveals the tragedy, not in Chris' death, but in the possibility that his death was the only honest response to a life he refused to take part in. What Penn has done--besides the formidable task of presenting this sorrowful tale in a straightforward and truthful fashion--is what the greatest poets have always strived to do: to reveal the soul's longings, and reflect our own souls back at us.As Pauline Kael once wrote (of Francis Coppola's Godfather Part Two): that's the voice of the authentic hero.",4,Snapshots of the Heart,1204588800,"03 4,

1123022,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,B000ZN802W,Jeff  Farrow,"[1, 1]","I remember reading the actual account this film was based on & I felt sad. From what I read, I assumed that the subject of the news article had been suffering from some form of mental illness. So I knew the ending & this movie provided the history.Sean Penn's film presents us a young man who is not mentally disturbed, but a person who is clearly ""troubled,"" a person seeking a Self unstiffled by the realities of modern, materialistic society. This causes him to engage in very few relationships, and those he does form are on his own terms & with his right to terminate at any time. This is more than a kid running from a bickering upper middle class mother & father. I don't know how many other viewers saw the hero (anti-hero hero really) as much mentally ill as a rebel. When you do see it that way, you can't help but sympathize with the parents--and particularly with the sister who seemed very close to him.In the opening sequence, we see Nemo (I call the main character ""Nemo"" because he saw himself as a reality in search of an identity)graduate from college & offered a place at Harvard. His parents are ectsatic, but he's not interested. The fact that he graduated with honors does not necessarily rule out mental illness. Schizophrenia, for example, often doesn't manifest until young adulthood.Nemo carries on full conversations with  himself, acting out the parental anger & dysfunction. A major symptom of schizophrenia. He makes up wild names for himself. Another sign of borderline personality disorder. However, his quest for perfect freedom in Alaska is on a par with any one who is inspired by a goal, vision of a painting, etc. Nemo logically plans his quest over an extended period of time, demonstrating that if he IS mentally ill, at least he's very high functioning.I see Nemo's Alaska goal as being a form of ""The Great Work"" for him. It's accomplishment will free him from the lower forms of reality & raise him into unified, perfected/pure consciouness, a transcendental unity with One. He has overcome his father & mother and in doing so, has become his OWN father & mother. He states as much in the course of the movie. This is a metaphor of alchemy & magick ritual--it is also found in the New Testament teachings of Josahua ben Joseph (Jesus.) Nemo has also cut off the emotional attachment to his sister, his last long term relationship. He does not have sex--even when offered by a beautiful girl. Celibacy, another stage of The Work. He eats strange plants & roots--yep, yet another stage. Finding the bus in the middle of a gorgeous nowhere was like a gift from a spirit, an offering literally out of the blue.When in extremis, he encounters a bear who snifs him, then passes casually on. A totem image? hallucination? The bus was as much a gift as it was as a warning he failed to read correctly. His failure to assess the element of water in his calculations/metaphisical formula was, in the end, tragic. Such is the fate of many of attempt ""The Work"" on totally on their own.It is tragic, not just pathetic as some reviwers claim.Maybe, unlike most of us who don't take risks for the sake of comfort & security, Nemo could have found his inner Self, his true Godhood.Maybe he could have really healed, but didn't.That's a tragedy for any broken soul.PS NOTES: Hal Holbrook is excellent as the bitter, sad old man who lost his family--and he regenerated via his relationship with Nemo. As matter of fact, the persons he managed to connect with, all benefited from the relationship. There was a great deal of good in him that went unrealized & unfulfilledThe music in the film is really good & very appropriate to the scene they illuminate.At the films' conclusion, a photographic self-portrait of the man seems to indicate a man more troubled than at peace.",4,A Dream Unfinished,1263686400,"01 17, 2010",2010,3797,"['remember', 'reading', 'actual', 'account', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'felt', 'sad', 'what', 'read', 'assumed', 'subject', 'news', 'article', 'had', 'been', 'suffering', 'form', 'mental', 'illness', 'knew', 'ending', 'movie', 'provided', 'history.Sean', 'Penn', 'film', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'person', 'who', 'clearly', 'troubled', 'person', 'seeking', 'Self', 'unstiffled', 'realities', 'modern', 'materialistic', 'society', 'engage', 'very', 'few', 'relationships', 'form', 'are', 'own', 'terms', 'right', 'terminate', 'time', 'more', 'kid', 'running', 'bickering', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'mother', 'father', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'viewers', 'saw', 'hero', 'anti-hero', 'hero', 'really', 'much', 'mentally', 'ill', 'rebel', 'When', 'do', 'see', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'sympathize', 'parents', 'particularly', 'sister', 'who', 'seemed', 'very', 'close', 'him.In', 'opening', 'sequence', 'see', 'Nemo', 'call', 'main', 'character', 'Nemo', 'saw', 'reality', 'search', 'identity', 'graduate', 'college', 'offered', 'place', 'Harvard', 'parents', 'are', 'ectsatic', 'not', 'interested', 'fact', 'graduated', 'honors', 'not', 'necessarily', 'rule', 'mental', 'illness', 'Schizophrenia', 'example', 'often', ""n't"", 'manifest', 'young', 'adulthood.Nemo', 'full', 'conversations', 'acting', 'out', 'parental', 'anger', 'dysfunction', 'major', 'symptom', 'schizophrenia', 'up', 'wild', 'names', 'sign', 'borderline', 'personality', 'disorder', 'However', 'quest', 'perfect', 'freedom', 'Alaska', 'par', 'one', 'who', 'inspired', 'goal', 'vision', 'painting', 'etc', 'Nemo', 'logically', 'quest', 'extended', 'period', 'time', 'demonstrating', 'mentally', 'ill', 'least', 'very', 'high', 'functioning.I', 'see', 'Nemo', 'Alaska', 'goal', 'being', 'form', 'Great', 'Work', 'accomplishment', 'will', 'free', 'lower', 'forms', 'reality', 'raise', 'unified', 'perfected/pure', 'consciouness', 'transcendental', 'unity', 'One', 'overcome', 'father', 'mother', 'doing', 'so', 'become', 'OWN', 'father', 'mother', 'as', 'much', 'course', 'movie', 'metaphor', 'alchemy', 'magick', 'ritual', 'also', 'found', 'New', 'Testament', 'teachings', 'Josahua', 'ben', 'Joseph', 'Jesus', 'Nemo', 'also', 'cut', 'off', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'sister', 'last', 'long', 'term', 'relationship', 'not', 'have', 'sex', 'even', 'when', 'offered', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'Celibacy', 'stage', 'Work', 'strange', 'plants', 'roots', 'yep', 'yet', 'stage', 'Finding', 'bus', 'middle', 'gorgeous', 'nowhere', 'was', 'gift', 'spirit', 'offering', 'literally', 'blue.When', 'extremis', 'bear', 'who', 'snifs', 'then', 'casually', 'totem', 'image', 'hallucination', 'bus', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'gift', 'was', 'warning', 'failed', 'read', 'correctly', 'failure', 'assess', 'element', 'water', 'calculations/metaphisical', 'formula', 'was', 'end', 'tragic', 'Such', 'fate', 'many', 'attempt', 'Work', 'totally', 'own.It', 'tragic', 'not', 'just', 'pathetic', 'reviwers', 'claim.Maybe', 'most', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'risks', 'sake', 'comfort', 'security', 'Nemo', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'inner', 'Self', 'true', 'Godhood.Maybe', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'healed', ""didn't.That"", 'tragedy', 'broken', 'soul.PS', 'NOTES', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'excellent', 'bitter', 'sad', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'family', 'regenerated', 'relationship', 'Nemo', 'matter', 'fact', 'persons', 'managed', 'connect', 'benefited', 'relationship', 'was', 'great', 'deal', 'good', 'went', 'unrealized', 'unfulfilledThe', 'music', 'film', 'really', 'good', 'very', 'appropriate', 'scene', 'illuminate.At', 'films', 'conclusion', 'photographic', 'self-portrait', 'man', 'indicate', 'man', 'more', 'troubled', 'peace']",N/A

Murdoch ""Creative Sparkplug""","[12, 14]","When I was in high school, Jack London's story, ""To Build a Fire"" was required reading in at least one English class. Why? Well besides being an incredibly well-written story and from the unsentimental naturalist school, perhaps someone in the faculty was trying to send a not so subtle message to us teenagers to ""not do something really stupid.""Chris McCandless either never read the story or blew it off thinking it could never happen to him.To Build a Fire is story about an Alaskan adventurer who gets his feet wet and has about 15 min to build a fire and warm and dry his feet before they freeze making it impossible to get out alive. The story made a huge impression on me because it drove home the point that nature is powerful and in unforgiving conditions when it's man vs nature, nature usually wins unless man is just pure lucky. And in London's story, this is a guy who actually knew what he was doing.In McCandless' case you could have titled the story ""To Smoke a Moose"" because after McCandless manages to shoot and kill a moose he has no clue what to do with the carcass and tries to skin, dress, and smoke the huge animal. It turns into a flyblown mess and as everyone else has already commented, McCandless dies of starvation not long afterwards.It's a beautiful movie and is painfully true to the book. I gave my review 3-stars because as a production, Sean Penn did an amazing job not only of directing but of casting, cinematography, set design, and the sound track. It's a beautiful film in many ways and the performances, particularly by Emile Hirsch, Catherine Keener, and Hal Holbrook are affecting.The problem is McCandless just isn't a sympathetic character. He's clearly bright, likable, and idealistic. But he's also young, self-centered, and clueless and completely caught up into the romance of his adventure. Like a lot of 20-somethings. Unfortunately his situation was a lot more extreme and unforgiving than the struggles most of his peers were dealing with.The tragedy that struck me most was that Chris had a knack for connecting with people at a deep level. He seemed to make close friendships easily with others pursuing an alternative lifestyle. Yet, he's irresponsible in his relationships in the sense that he doesn't take into account the affect he has on the hearts of others. Nor does he fully understand what a loss it is for others when he moves on.At the very end when, for the first, time he realizes that he's in over his head and he may very well lose his life, how much those connections mattered. By then, unfortunately, it's too late.If you have a friend or kid with wanderlust, make sure they read To Build a Fire before they set out on their Great Adventure.",3,"Should have read ""To Build a Fire"" Before he Set Out",1236384000,"03 7, 2009",2009,2714,"['When', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'Jack', 'London', 'story', 'Build', 'Fire', 'was', 'required', 'reading', 'least', 'one', 'English', 'class', 'Why', 'Well', 'being', 'incredibly', 'well-written', 'story', 'unsentimental', 'naturalist', 'school', 'perhaps', 'someone', 'faculty', 'was', 'trying', 'send', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'message', 'teenagers', 'not', 'do', 'something', 'really', 'stupid', 'Chris', 'McCandless', 'never', 'read', 'story', 'blew', 'off', 'thinking', 'could', 'never', 'happen', 'him.To', 'Build', 'Fire', 'story', 'Alaskan', 'adventurer', 'who', 'feet', 'wet', 'about', '15', 'min', 'build', 'fire', 'warm', 'dry', 'feet', 'freeze', 'making', 'impossible', 'get', 'out', 'alive', 'story', 'made', 'huge', 'impression', 'drove', 'home', 'point', 'nature', 'powerful', 'unforgiving', 'conditions', 'when', 'man', 'vs', 'nature', 'nature', 'usually', 'man', 'just', 'pure', 'lucky', 'London', 'story', 'guy', 'who', 'actually', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing.In', 'McCandless', 'case', 'could', 'have', 'titled', 'story', 'Smoke', 'Moose', 'McCandless', 'shoot', 'kill', 'moose', 'clue', 'what', 'do', 'carcass', 'tries', 'skin', 'dress', 'smoke', 'huge', 'animal', 'flyblown', 'mess', 'everyone', 'else', 'already', 'commented', 'McCandless', 'starvation', 'not', 'long', 'afterwards.It', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'painfully', 'true', 'book', 'gave', 'review', '3-stars', 'production', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'not', 'only', 'directing', 'casting', 'cinematography', 'set', 'design', 'sound', 'track', 'beautiful', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'are', 'affecting.The', 'problem', 'McCandless', 'just', ""n't"", 'sympathetic', 'character', 'clearly', 'bright', 'likable', 'idealistic', 'also', 'young', 'self-centered', 'clueless', 'completely', 'caught', 'up', 'romance', 'adventure', 'lot', '20-somethings', 'Unfortunately', 'situation', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'extreme', 'unforgiving', 'struggles', 'most', 'peers', 'were', 'dealing', 'with.The', 'tragedy', 'struck', 'most', 'was', 'Chris', 'had', 'knack', 'connecting', 'people', 'deep', 'level', 'seemed', 'make', 'close', 'friendships', 'easily', 'others', 'pursuing', 'alternative', 'lifestyle', 'irresponsible', 'relationships', 'sense', ""n't"", 'take', 'account', 'affect', 'hearts', 'others', 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'loss', 'others', 'when', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'first', 'time', 'head', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'lose', 'life', 'how', 'much', 'connections', 'mattered', 'then', 'unfortunately', 'too', 'late.If', 'have', 'friend', 'kid', 'wanderlust', 'make', 'sure', 'read', 'Build', 'Fire', 'set', 'out', 'Great', 'Adventure']",N/A

Even as I sit here typing this review, I am moved by the closing five minutes and the story that led up to it.Despite a few shots of full body nudity and a few scenes of foul-mouthed discourse, I found 'Into the Wild' to be almost a holy experience, as if God was somehow accentuating the risk of wanderlust, as well as its difficulty acquired reward, while at the same time showing us that true living consists of the relationships we forge. That's the feeling I came away with, and this feeling can be attributed to Mr. Sean Penn, the director of the film.Penn brings to life the tragic tale of Christopher McCandless in a way that I doubt even the best in Hollywood could manage. He takes Krakauer's book and molds a film that somehow waves its petite hands at Hollywood's big brother blockbusters and defeats them with ease. My God, what a wonderful film, and a soundtrack that beautifully augments the film! Penn captures both the beauty of McCandless' trek across America and the sad, horrifying realization he comes to in his final moments.Perhaps more importantly than anything else, Penn pushes the human relationship to the forefront and defines love by an ability to forgive those around us. This point is stressed by McCandless himself as he realizes the lesson in his desperate and lonely final days.Seize the chance to watch an Oscar winner before the legions of Saw fans realize it even exists.

1123036,A61RNXZ3HWKGB,B000ZN802W,"John Murphy ""O, for a Muse of Fire""","[4, 5]","""Into the Wild"" is based on the true story of Chris McCandless, a college graduate from a posh family who abandoned his privileged existence for a life of hitchhiking, living off the land, and go-with-the-flow spirituality. He sent his life savings to OxFam, scissored his credit cards, and burnt his identification. He's reborn as ""Alexander Supertramp;"" lone wanderer of the American landscape.Chris is an intelligent and earnest young man. Sick of modern civilization and its crass materialism, he finds inspiration in the pages of Thoreau, Tolstoy, and Jack London. The holy grail of his quest for spiritual enlightenment is Alaska, a place where he can be alone to ""just be out there in it. You know, big mountains, rivers, sky, game. Just be out there in it, you know? In the wild.""Sean Penn's lyrical and intimate directing style owes a debt to Terrence Malick, who directed Penn in ""The Thin Red Line."" The lush images of sunsets, soaring birds, and falling water seem to reinforce Chris' Romantic vision of man's spiritual relationship to nature -- the movie even opens with a quote from Lord Byron -- and when Chris says, ""You don't need human relationships to be happy, God has placed it all around us,"" you wonder if Penn perhaps endorses this somewhat reductive view of life.Then something happens in the second half of the film that casts Chris's journey in a new light. In the final chapter of the movie Chris meets Ron Franz (Hal Holbrook), a retired Army man, recovered alcoholic, and devout man-of-faith. They develop a quiet, unassuming friendship based on sympathy and understanding. Ron, having heard of Chris' family troubles, tells him: ""When you forgive, you love. And when you love, God's light shines upon you."" This chapter of the film is titled: ""The Getting of Wisdom.""The tragedy of ""Into the Wild"" is that Chris refuses the grace offered through the relationship with Ron, whose life of hope and love is the true holy grail of spiritual enlightenment, not Alaska. Ron invites Chris to stay with him as an adopted grandson, but Chris, in his restlessness, feels compelled to continue on his way to the vast emptiness of Alaska.But Ron's vision of life as forgiveness and love returns to Chris in his loneliness and isolation in the wilderness. In his mind's eye, Chris sees his joyful return to his family, embracing them in the life-giving love made possible by forgiveness. In his mind, he asks them: ""What if I were smiling and running into your arms? Would you see then what I see now?""There he remains, sick and starving in the Alaskan wilderness, ""trapped in the wild"" as he writes in his journal. His final insight is scribbled into the margins of his tattered copy of Tolstoy: ""Happiness is only real when shared.""",4,"""Happiness Is Only Real When Shared""",1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,2752,"['Wild', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Chris', 'McCandless', 'college', 'graduate', 'posh', 'family', 'who', 'abandoned', 'privileged', 'existence', 'life', 'hitchhiking', 'living', 'off', 'land', 'go-with-the-flow', 'spirituality', 'sent', 'life', 'savings', 'OxFam', 'scissored', 'credit', 'cards', 'burnt', 'identification', 'reborn', 'Alexander', 'Supertramp', 'lone', 'wanderer', 'American', 'landscape.Chris', 'intelligent', 'earnest', 'young', 'man', 'Sick', 'modern', 'civilization', 'crass', 'materialism', 'inspiration', 'pages', 'Thoreau', 'Tolstoy', 'Jack', 'London', 'holy', 'grail', 'quest', 'spiritual', 'enlightenment', 'Alaska', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'alone', 'just', 'be', 'out', 'there', 'know', 'big', 'mountains', 'rivers', 'sky', 'game', 'Just', 'be', 'out', 'there', 'know', 'wild', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'lyrical', 'intimate', 'directing', 'style', 'debt', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'who', 'directed', 'Penn', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'lush', 'images', 'sunsets', 'soaring', 'birds', 'falling', 'water', 'seem', 'reinforce', 'Chris', 'Romantic', 'vision', 'man', 'spiritual', 'relationship', 'nature', 'movie', 'even', 'quote', 'Lord', 'Byron', 'when', 'Chris', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'human', 'relationships', 'be', 'happy', 'God', 'placed', 'wonder', 'Penn', 'perhaps', 'somewhat', 'reductive', 'view', 'life.Then', 'something', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'Chris', 'journey', 'new', 'light', 'final', 'chapter', 'movie', 'Chris', 'Ron', 'Franz', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'retired', 'Army', 'man', 'recovered', 'alcoholic', 'man-of-faith', 'develop', 'quiet', 'unassuming', 'friendship', 'based', 'sympathy', 'understanding', 'Ron', 'having', 'heard', 'Chris', 'family', 'troubles', 'When', 'forgive', 'love', 'when', 'love', 'God', 'light', 'shines', 'chapter', 'film', 'titled', 'Getting', 'Wisdom', 'tragedy', 'Into', 'Wild', 'Chris', 'grace', 'offered', 'relationship', 'Ron', 'life', 'hope', 'love', 'true', 'holy', 'grail', 'spiritual', 'enlightenment', 'not', 'Alaska', 'Ron', 'Chris', 'stay', 'adopted', 'grandson', 'Chris', 'restlessness', 'feels', 'compelled', 'continue', 'way', 'vast', 'emptiness', 'Alaska.But', 'Ron', 'vision', 'life', 'forgiveness', 'love', 'returns', 'Chris', 'loneliness', 'isolation', 'wilderness', 'mind', 'eye', 'Chris', 'joyful', 'return', 'family', 'embracing', 'life-giving', 'love', 'made', 'possible', 'forgiveness', 'mind', 'What', 'were', 'smiling', 'running', 'arms', 'Would', 'see', 'then', 'what', 'see', 'now', 'sick', 'starving', 'Alaskan', 'wilderness', 'trapped', 'wild', 'journal', 'final', 'insight', 'scribbled', 'margins', 'tattered', 'copy', 'Tolstoy', 'Happiness', 'only', 'real', 'when', 'shared']",N/A
1123037,A332MW6OA1LYDF,B000ZN802W,John Noodles,"[30, 36]","This movie is an adolescent boy's nocturnal emission, and while I found it entertaining, it was far from the profound experience it means to be.Likeable and intelligent, Christopher McCandless was also self-centered, selfish, and extraordinarily--nay, fatally--foolish.  This movie romanticizes that foolishness to make McCandless's death have ""meaning.""  The fact is, though, he died an idiot's death, and he died desperate. In the movie, his parting written words are, ""I HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE AND THANK THE LORD. GOODBYE AND MAY GOD BLESS ALL!""  Those words are accurate--he did write them--but the words that the hunters who found him read posted on the door of the bus were no less believable: ""S.O.S. I need your help. I am injured, near death, and too weak to hike out of here. I am all alone, this is no joke. In the name of God, please remain to save me. I am out collecting berries close by and shall return this evening. Thank you, Chris McCandless."" Not the heroic smiling existential death the movie portrayed and that teenage boys imagine for themselves, is it?This kid was a lousy son, and a lousy brother, and the movie shows this but distorts his real-life relationship with his parents in order to make his abysmal selfishness less damning.  He took off without leaving word to his family, and never let them know where he was or how he was doing. He disappeared, and 2 years later Mom and Dad found he was dead.  And now this hagiography paints them in a very unflattering light and will haunt them for the rest of their lives.Chris chose to go into the bush with minimal gear and no map.  Had he taken a map, he'd have realized that only 1/4 mile from where he tried to cross the river he would have found a manual tram in which he could have easily crossed; he wasn't stranded, and he needn't have starved.  He starved a a couple days' hike from the highway, in the middle of summer.  This movie suggests (probably based on early versions of Jon Krakauer's book) that he accidentally poisoned himself by eating a toxic plant that is very hard to distinguish from a certain edible one.  That was speculation, and was proved false by the toxicology report.  McCandless died from simple starvation.  In the middle of summer.  20 miles from a highway.  At one point 1/4 of a mile from a river crossing.  That isn't romantic; it isn't heroic.  It's stupid.  Let's call it what it is, so other young men aren't seduced by the same juvenile hubris.If this movie didn't purport to be a true story, and didn't romanticize what is really an unhappy story, I wouldn't have a problem with it.  It's well acted and maintains tension from beginning to end.  There were some Hallmark Card moments, but I enjoyed it and would watch it again.

1123052,A1QFM9CFEUXZK5,B000ZN802W,Kendra,"[65, 75]","Into the Wild is one of those movies whose images stay with you after the screen goes dark. This is a tribute to the subject-- a tragic and confused young pseudo idealist, Christopher McCandless-- and Sean Penn and his crew.McCandless has just graduated from Emory University. He's bright, well-liked, talented, the world is his for the taking-- it seems. Then he chucks it all, burns his money, abandons his vehicle, donates his graduate school fund to charity and hits the road. He's a leatherfoot, hoofing all across the country from Atlanta to South Dakota, on to California and finally to his goal of the utopian loner's dream world of ""Alaska"". Alaska is quoted here because it represents far more for McCandless than just a remote place full of emptiness and nature. It represents the ""wild"" - that gorgeous and challenging place where he can find himself, or so he thinks.He's on a wild goose chase with himself but doesn't quite understand or realize it. He thinks he's stuffing life and experience and learning into all the time that he has-- he's abandoned everything including his sister and parents. In fact, he refuses to communicate with them at all. Their heartbreak, worry, fears, and frustrations are with us the viewer at all times and we wonder (as do a few characters in the film) silently, ""how can he do this to them""?Chris hits the road hard. He takes odd jobs, and goes from frustrated relationship to the next one. But they always are frustrating because he simply will not give of himself. They aren't frustrating for him, but for those who want to befriend him. His search for personal meaning is truly little more than an avoidance of his own personal demons, mostly from his parents' history and rocky marriage. He is surrounded by love, people who want him, his company, his brilliance and soft, caring approach to the world. He is attractive to others, but he loathes himself somehow. In the wilds of the Alaskan wilderness he thinks he will find what he is looking for and he does, but not in the way that he expected.Again and again, people that Chris meets offer their friendship to him and sometimes their love. But he cannot accept it. Something in him prevents him from accepting love or truly giving it. Perhaps it would be contrary to the loner path that he'd chosen?This is a sad story, so beautifully filmed. The acting is spot on, too.Hal Holbrook plays an old man with a painful secret of his own. He knows that Chris and he are two of a kind and need each other. We in the audience also know this. Holbrook is Chris' chance for stability and a home, the true path to insight for someone whose core issues are built upon a perceived betrayal and lack of love from others, mainly his parents. It's a hard moment for the viewer when Chris walks away from Holbrook abandoning another fortunate opportunity for healing and happiness, but it is not so hard for Chris whose focus is solely on getting to his personal nirvana that he understands and expects Alaska to be.Alaska is a beautiful but challenging place. Superbly filmed, it is easy to see how Chris would want to be there, challenge himself and try to find himself, alone-- try to find a way to fit in with others which is truly the issue-- alone.The exact cause of Chris' death is not fully known. The book's author and Penn both make the case the McCandless accidentally poisoned himself. But later tests on the suspected plant material recovered from his camp site cast serious doubt on this theory as no poison was found.  According to the diaries that he left behind he had decided to return to civilization but a raging river full of spring melt prevented him from doing so. He stayed in his camp, wasting away. But only a mile away was a perfectly usable crossing, and less than half a mile away was a still part of the river where he could have fished to his heart's content with only his hands as the fish were so plentiful there. But he did neither and apparently chose to stay and face his demons and his new understandings alone.It is not clear if Chris is a hero-- the lone introvert heading into the wilderness akin to Thoreau to find the ""truth"", or rather a spoiled city boy with only ignorance and dreams and personal pain and perhaps some mental illness driving him on.The locals in the wilds of Alaska often speak of such people who come to Alaska to find themselves, swollen with pride like the rivers full of melting snows. And they have little respect for them, as they tempt fate and the extreme wilderness and usually lose.McCandless affected everyone he met in a positive way. His writings are those of a young man still trying to understand but so deeply haunted by something he could only identify at the very end that was at the heart of his troubles. The tears of his parents, his friends, and even his own at the end are palatable in this beautiful film by Sean Penn.This is a deeply troubling story of someone who so needed help, was offered it-- but would not or could not accept it.The world is full of Chris McCandlesses going about their daily routines. And perhaps this is why his story has such resonance for so many. He chose to break out of the life he was living, a life that gave him no comfort or solace-- and stride into the unknown to find one that worked for him. It may be a loner's story or a vagabond's tale, but there is a universality about the demons that haunted Chris, and his single-minded yet unfortunate response to them.There is no glory here, and little to reflect upon but the pain of someone who is unable to stop, unable to find another path-- until his dream of Alaska and the wilderness with all its perils was met and its lessons pulled from it at whatever the cost. This is a superb film.",5,Superb Film about Looking so Far for Something that is So Close,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,5752,"['Wild', 'one', 'movies', 'images', 'stay', 'screen', 'dark', 'tribute',

The story chronicles the westward odyssey of Chris McCandless, an over privileged suburban kid who is determined to live out a peripatetic bohemian existence and to somehow ""find himself"" in the rigors of nature.  The cinematography is beautiful.A series of vignettes offers mini-stories within the movie.  Chris as a farm hand. Living with vagabond hippies. Befriending an elderly widower who makes leather crafts.  (Hal Holbrooke is stunningly good in his role and, in my view, steals the movie.)What all of these encounters share in common is a pattern of McCandless engaging with other people but eventually stopping short of commitment, pulling away and forging on toward his Alaskan sojourn.A latter-day Thoreau and literary hermit, he meets his demise in an abandoned and isolated school bus in the backcountry wilderness. Perhaps McCandless should have spent more time burnishing his survival skills, training at NOLS or Outward Bound and spending less time reading ""Dr. Zhivago.""The movie offers interesting food for thought on how life's meaning is attained:* Through books and learning* Through conventional bourgeois pursuit of career, marriage and 2.5 children* Through testing one's limits against nature in an isolated setting* Through human connections and relationshipsMcCandless is fixated on the ""test manhood through nature"" approach.  He dies an isolated, painful death, leaving a wake of heartbroken people behind him, not the least of which was his family, with whom he abruptly cut off communications.  In the end, Alexander Supertramp dies searching for the Truth.Did he find it?  Who knows.  The movie's closing only hints of this.

1123056,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000ZN802W,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","When I read Jon Krakauer's ""Into the Wild"" approximately ten years ago, I was mesmerized by the tragic real-life tale of Christopher McCandless. But as much as I loved the book, I never even thought about a film adaptation. Maybe that was shortsighted of me. Recounting McCandless's life and reconstructing it with minimal data and much introspection, ""Into the Wild"" succeeded as a cautionary adventure of idealism gone awry. Much of McCandless's life was lived alone and much of his story was pieced together though brief encounters or recovered writings. So what was a thoughtful portrait on the page never really seemed like it would translate to the screen--certainly not with the same impact. Luckily, though, Sean Penn thought otherwise. Adapting and directing Krakauer's fine book, Penn has fashioned a sad, funny and exciting film with tremendous emotional resonance.An affluent and likable young man, McCandless graduated with honors from Emory University and then set a course to redefine his life. Abandoning his family, friends, and material possessions--McCandless assumed the pseudonym of Alexander Supertramp and set off to explore the world in its most innocent form. Living off the land and experiencing nature, fellow travelers, and much adventure--McCandless was looking for a modern day utopia and sought to discover his real self as he cast away the corruptions of modern life. Touring the country for two years, McCandless's exploration was to culminate in an Alaskan sojourn--where he would commune with ""the wild."" His aspirations can be viewed as both admirable and delusional--but that is part of the complexity of McCandless's life. As much as you want him to succeed, you realize there can be no happy ending with the expectations he has in place.Penn's ""Into the Wild,"" thus, depends on evoking a McCandless that you will care about--either because you commend his pursuit or because you want him to come to his senses. And it really works in combination. In a dynamic performance, Emile Hirsch transcends his previous work and becomes a full-fledged leading man. Hitting all the right notes, Hirsch creates a character who evokes our sympathy, our frustration, and even our laughter. McCandless meets a lot of companions on the road, and Hirsch makes it easy to see why he was so accepted. A great role--Hirsch meets all the emotional challenges and also makes a physical transformation that is a both startling and powerful. His great work is matched by a roster of big names including Vince Vaughn, William Hurt, Jena Malone, and Marcia Gay Hardin (among many others). But Catherine Keener and Hal Holbrook are real stand-outs--their adoptive relationships with Hirsch both challenge him and make him understand (eventually) that life is not meant to be lived alone.If there is any flaw in the film, it exists in the book as well. We can only know so much about McCandless from the resources available. He had a heightened sense of injustice particularly when it came to the ""untruths"" or perceived wrongs perpetuated by his family. Nothing presented, however, can explain how his relatively normal dysfunction blossomed into such an extreme world view. This secret is in McCandless's mind alone.""Into the Wild"" works as a character study and a gritty drama, but also as an adventure. The scenery and photography are breathtaking and the action sequences are well executed. There is much genuine warmth and humor in the film as well. It was a fully satisfying film experience, to me, and has many quiet moments that have stayed with me. Highly recommended for serious adult audiences.

I didn't necessarily find it inspiring or particularly beautiful, but I did think it was very intelligent, thought provoking, consistent, and well directed/acted. It's basically a film about independence and freedom, and how those can be terrible, isolating things when taken to the extreme. For those who thought the minor characters were too distracting, try to think about them in that context.It's almost like the minor characters are there to warn the main character that even though living your own life is great, a lack of human interaction makes that freedom painful. These are lessons he fails to realize at every turn, whomever he meets, (instead he feels like he is there to enlighten them) and this selfish interpretation of independence is his tragedy.Think about why he dies: not only has he tried to do everything himself, which is a mistake on this kind of trip, (again, there were warning signs, like he should have figured this out when the moose killing thing went bad) but he's either so devoted to his dream or so frightened to go back and face the family he's running away from that there is nowhere to run to anymore. I guess living by independence means dying by it.There's a key scene in the middle, where he goes to the homeless shelter in LA, then sees himself getting sucked into the upper middle class hypocrisy he hates. Even though this is irrational -- if he can strike out on his own with a backpack, he can also do so in a more socially integrated way  -- he turns away from going back to his old name. He does realize eventually that it was a mistake, but like all tragic figures, it is only after it is too late to change anything.I think most people knew a guy like this in college, the upper middle class ""rebel"" who could have done anything and then took to the road after graduation, but eventually came back to sell out and work on wall street. maybe that's why this book was so popular -- because this guy took it to the extreme and he died, thus reinforcing others' decisions to rebel a little, but then run back home to mommy and daddy. Put in that way, the people who like the book and film for these reasons don't come across so well.Truly a provocative and interesting film -- those are just my thoughts, but I think you should see it and decide for yourself.",4,Independence taken to the extreme,1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,2390,"['may', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'different', 'reasons', 'other', 'reviewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'find', 'inspiring', 'particularly', 'beautiful', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'very', 'intelligent', 'thought', 'provoking', 'consistent', 'well', 'directed/acted', 'basically', 'film', 'independence', 'freedom', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'terrible', 'isolating', 'things', 'when', 'taken', 'extreme', 'who', 'thought', 'minor', 'characters', 'were', 'too', 'distracting', 'try', 'think', 'context.It', 'almost', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'there', 'warn', 'main', 'character', 'even', 'living', 'own', 'life', 'great', 'lack', 'human', 'interaction', 'freedom', 'painful', 'are', 'lessons', 'realize', 'turn', 'whomever', 'instead', 'there', 'enlighten', 'selfish', 'interpretation', 'independence', 'tragedy.Think', 'why', 'not', 'only', 'tried', 'do', 'everything', 'mistake', 'kind', 'trip', 'again', 'were', 'warning', 'signs', 'should', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'when', 'moose', 'killing', 'thing', 'went', 'bad', 'so', 'devoted', 'dream', 'so', 'frightened', 'go', 'back', 'face', 'family', 'running', 'away', 'nowhere', 'run', 'anymore', 'guess', 'living', 'independence', 'means', 'dying', 'it.There', 'key', 'scene', 'middle', 'where', 'homeless', 'shelter', 'LA', 'then', 'getting', 'sucked', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'hypocrisy', 'Even', 'irrational', 'can', 'strike', 'out', 'own', 'backpack', 'can', 'also', 'do', 'so', 'more', 'socially', 'integrated', 'way', 'away', 'going', 'back', 'old', 'name', 'realize', 'eventually', 'was', 'mistake', 'tragic', 'figures', 'only', 'too', 'late', 'change', 'anything.I', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'knew', 'guy', 'college', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'rebel', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'anything', 'then', 'took', 'road', 'graduation', 'eventually', 'came', 'back', 'sell', 'out', 'work', 'wall', 'street', 'maybe', 'why', 'book', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'guy', 'took', 'extreme', 'died', 'thus', 'reinforcing', 'others', 'decisions', 'rebel', 'little', 'then', 'run', 'back', 'home', 'mommy', 'daddy', 'Put', 'way', 'people', 'who', 'book', 'film', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'so', 'well.Truly', 'provocative', 'interesting', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'thoughts', 'think', 'should', 'see', 'decide']",N/A

We are required to read Into the Wild, and it's nice to compare the book with the movie.  The movie is quite different from the book.  It's more linear.  The book, as you may know, focuses more on the various people that interacted with Chris, as well as on the man who wrote the book (Krakauer).  The movie is more the trace of the arc of Chris's life.  Because the two works are so different, you can require a very nice compare and contrast essay.  Also, I really suggest you pair this movie with Rivers and Tides, about the work of Andrew Goldsworthy.  His work with nature is so benign, and Chris's interaction is so critical, and these to films make lovely bookends for a discussion about nature- is she pastoral, or is she red in tooth and claw- or is she both?  I also had my students do an art project, along the lines of Goldsworthy's work- and they had to write a paper explaining the symbolism of their art.  It was quite a nice project.

Although he comes from a wealthy family, and is college educated, young McCandless finds a soul-searing pull that no one understands - but himself.An unwavering desire to leave civilization behind, due in part to his families morbid background while growing up, but with a strong bond of love from his sister, young McCandless still feels the need to find his destiny in the Alaskan wilderness.Beautifully shot in fantastic locations, Sean Penn also captures much more of the human heart in this strong, although somewhat tragic tale of the human spirit. I felt the highs and lows of this young man's journeys, from finding people to help heal, to finding first love in the strangest of places, this movie will take viewers on a journey of one young man's self-discovery, filling the vacuums of different people's hearts, and in various beautiful ways, that anyone with half a heart can't help but feel.Sean Penn truly captured on film the raw emotions that lie within us all. The beauty, and the beast that lies just under the surface, but which few of us truly understand, nor usually act upon.Into the Wild is a masterpiece in so many ways: from its acting to its cinematography, it is a true portrait of a young man's life that few people can truly call upon themselves to actually do that they most desire to dream about - leave the thin veneer of civilization behind and lose themselves into the beautiful but deadly landscapes of the wild.This remarkable film deserves every penny and accolade it got. Actually, it deserved much, much more. A film like this is rarely made, actually able to capture the raw essence of numerous people's lives of all its wide varieties.If the ending of this film doesn't draw strong emotion in you, full of its tragic but beautiful way, then you truly do not know what it means to be human.After seeing this film, Sean Penn has proven to me he is as good - if not better - than such huge directors such as Spielberg and the like.A must see for people who really should honor this fantastic young man's life.",5,Sean Penn's Masterpiece Theater!,1211587200,"05 24, 2008",2008,2294,"['anyone', 'would', 'dare', 'give', 'heartwarming', 'heartrending', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'movie', 'bad', 'review', 'have', 'heart.Sean', 'Penn', 'Into', 'Wild', 'tour-de-force', 'showcasing', 'real-life', 'young', 'man', 'desire', 'lose', 'wilds', 'Alaska', 'wealthy', 'family', 'college', 'educated', 'young', 'McCandless', 'soul-searing', 'pull', 'one', 'himself.An', 'unwavering', 'desire', 'leave', 'civilization', 'due', 'part', 'families', 'morbid', 'background', 'growing', 'up', 'strong', 'bond', 'love', 'sister', 'young', 'McCandless', 'still', 'need', 'find', 'destiny', 'Alaskan', 'wilderness.Beautifully', 'fantastic', 'locations', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'also', 'much', 'more', 'human', 'heart', 'strong', 'somewhat', 'tragic', 'tale', 'human', 'spirit', 'felt', 'highs', 'lows', 'young', 'man', 'journeys', 'finding', 'people', 'help', 'heal', 'finding', 'first', 'love', 'strangest', 'places', 'movie', 'will', 'take', 'viewers', 'journey', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'self-discovery', 'filling', 'vacuums', 'different', 'people', 'hearts', 'various', 'beautiful', 'ways', 'anyone', 'heart', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel.Sean', 'Penn', 'truly', 'captured', 'film', 'raw', 'emotions', 'lie', 'beauty', 'beast', 'just', 'surface', 'few', 'truly', 'understand', 'usually', 'act', 'Wild', 'masterpiece', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'true', 'portrait', 'young', 'man', 'life', 'few', 'people', 'can', 'truly', 'call', 'upon', 'actually', 'do', 'most', 'desire', 'dream', 'leave', 'thin', 'veneer', 'civilization', 'lose', 'beautiful', 'deadly', 'landscapes', 'wild.This', 'remarkable', 'film', 'deserves', 'penny', 'accolade', 'got', 'Actually', 'deserved', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'rarely', 'made', 'actually', 'able', 'capture', 'raw', 'essence', 'numerous', 'people', 'lives', 'wide', 'ending', 'film', ""n't"", 'draw', 'strong', 'emotion', 'full', 'tragic', 'beautiful', 'way', 'then', 'truly', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'be', 'human.After', 'seeing', 'film', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'proven', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'such', 'huge', 'directors', 'such', 'Spielberg', 'like.A', 'must', 'see', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'should', 'honor', 'fantastic', 'young', 'man', 'life']",N/A

Everest, so I was interested to see how a film based on this book would turn out. I haven't read the book, but I did enjoy the movie, and found it memorable in many ways, although some liberties were taken for artistic reasons.All the main players turned in superb performances, and Hal Holbrook (who I almost didn't recognize as I hadn't seen him on-screen in probably 25 years), was a joy to watch; he turns in possibly his greatest performance in a long, distinguished career as the aging preacher. He must be about 80 and looks pretty darn good for his age. He turns in a thoughtful but forceful performance as a man, who, although nearing the and of this life, has found the peace that Chris unsuccessfully seeks.Emile Hirsch is outstanding in the lead role as Chris, in which he's portrayed almost as a mythic adventurer of old setting out to test himself against the elements. He's charismatic and collects many friends and admirers along the way. Cris is convinced that he must purge the ""evil within,"" why this is, isn't really explained, except that Chris had fallen under the influence of authors such as Thoreau, and others who had exhorted the importance of living apart from society in order to live the solitary life and reflect.The cinematography is also one of the film's great strengths. You'll enjoy the many stunning vistas of Alaska, which is still largely an unspoiled and unexploited land. Let's hope it stays that way.Overall the film is a dramatic and beautiful portrayal of a young man's quest for meaning, allthough it ultimately ended in tragedy, Despite some departures from the facts (Chris was not the charismatic character that was portrayed in the movie so much as a loner), it's still a fine film and one worth seeing for the other aesthetic qualities it brings to the screen.While we're on the subject, I wanted to make a few comments on another topic. I've read several Alaskan's comments who were very critical of Chris and what he tried to do, saying how foolish it was and how it showed little respect for the wilderness and the sort of skills and learning it takes to survive under those conditions, which can only be gleaned from many years of experience, and preferably under the tutelage of an experienced backwoodsman.That is no doubt true, and it's certainly true that Chris made some serious mistakes that an experienced backwoodsman wouldn't have made. For example, he failed to bring a map of the region that would have showed an area about 25 miles upstream where it spread out into some wide shallows, where the river could have safely been forded. There was also a hand tram only about a mile away from his camp that would have enabled him to escape. And he brought inadequate food and wasn't experienced enough in plant identification to live off the land, which led not only to starvation but poisioning when he misidentified a toxic plant that looked like a safe plant and that often grew right next to it.However, I would point out that those same people still buy their outdoor gear at REI, or some such, and have many modern conveniences that frontiersman or tribesman of old didn't have, which dramatically reduce the amount of labor and skill required and enhance their chances of survival. Not to mention the skillset of a late period Paleolithic hunter, who had to make his own spear tips and spears, bow and arrows, his own clothes, and virtually everything else in his toolkit himself. Even a modern woodsman's skills would pale by comparison to that.Recently I read a great biography of Daniel Boone and of his exploits in the new territories to the west. Of course, even he wasn't a Paleolithic hunter, but he was certainly one hell of a woodsman for his day. Equally impressive was the description of his wife. While Boone was off for several weeks wandering in a new area of the wilderness, leaving his young wife at home, she first proceeded to cut down the trees on their new plot of land. Then she built a small log cabin from the felled trees. Finally, she had their first field plowed and the crop sowed on the now cleared land by the time Boone got home. :-)Today, few people, even the vaunted backwoodsmen who criticized Chris, are the equivalent of a Daniel Boone, let alone a true Paleolithic hunter. While this doesn't excuse what Chris did, the perhaps sad truth is that hardly anyone living today has the skills of our ancestors that were honed over hundreds of thousands of years before they vanished in the wake of modern ""civilization.""",5,"Good flick, although not true to life",1208476800,"04 18, 2008",2008,4619,"['was', 'familiar', 'Krakauer', 'previous', 'book', 'Into', 'Thin',

He went into the Alaskan wilderness and came out a deity to be reckoned with! He made the decision to forego all personal wealth, in search of the ultimate answer! It's SOOOOO romantic, I want to cry. ALL of you folk who didn't like this film just didn't get it!! You are people incapable of dreaming the BIG dream!! This story is so inspirational, only those who understand Chris' journey toward enlightenment can truly call themselves devotees of His Divine Majesty!!His Family were worthless money-grubbers, His Mother was so out of touch with reality, and seeing his Father cry, at the end was so emotional (NOT). His ""friends"" just refused to accept that there are more important things than living on a slab of cement, out in the middle of nowhere, marking time, not caring that communing with the higher power is more important than life, itself!! And the old man? He just represented to Chris all that is wrong with humanity!! Leave all his worldly possessions to a man who has forsaken it? Was he nuts? Chris was above all that, the old coot was too stupid to see it!!When he reached Alaska, the vistas were beautiful!! It sure looked as though it was tough to be there, but Chris just KNEW what to do!! Yes, he made a mistake shooting that moose, but it was an honest one, and he can't be faulted for not knowing how to preserve the meat. He was just a displaced city kid, after all. His run-in with the bear had the hair on the back of my neck standing up!! It's a wonder he wasn't mauled or eaten. I guess the bear realized that Chris' journey wasn't over, yet!! I cried when he found out he ate those poisoned roots, but happy, too, because his story wouldn't have been so inspiring!! He died a HERO! No doubt about it!!You will have to forgive the one star rating. As of now, I would give this film 100 stars!! This is entertainment at it's finest!! Sean Penn captured the essence that was Christopher McCandless expertly, as an enlightened Director/Producer should!!

1123075,A1105JLXO95455,B000ZN802W,Mark from Minnesota,"[1, 4]","I initially had every intention of never seeing this movie after reading Jon Krakauer's excellent book of the same title.  The fact it was a Hollywood production directed by the repulsive Penn made me want to barf.  That said it was a good movie, very well done, even if it distorts the story to make a better movie which is what all wide release movies pretty much have to do to make a buck.Before you ever think of ordering the DVD, buy the book and read it a couple of times.  Then read some of Krakauer's other works and other authors' books on mountaineering and adventuring.  You'll get the impression that many extreme adventurers are trying to fill in some empty parts of their soul through challenging the elements, and many freely admit to as much.  There's nothing wrong with that, sometimes they are able to find peace of mind through their travels, other times not.This movie does not delve into this aspect of the story, which is good business because that would get pretty complicated and overshadow the McCandless personal story.  This movie is more of eulogy to the young man, which is fine, but you really need to look further to understand the important points Krakauer was trying to make in the book.So if you've read the book, the movie works great to personify the enigmatic McCandless and adds compelling visuals and narrative to his intriguing story.  If you have not read the book I think it would seem a little confusing and you would end up wondering why someone so naive has a big budget movie made about him.The story of McCandless is not all that unique, Krakauer points out in the book.  Many young men have made similar risky treks in search of some sort of truth they felt was not realizable in ordinary civilization.  What is unique is the fact Krakauer spent a lot of time and effort investigating and trying to place into context this young man's actions, relationships (or lack thereof) and motivations.Since he was a somewhat dysfunctional adventurer himself, Krakauer is able to lend an authenticity to his narrative that Hollywood cannot.  So while Penn did a fine job of running the story through the Hollywood production process, you do lose some of the most crucial insights of the book.Also, Penn cannot resist foisting his politics very awkwardly into the film...  let's pan to photo of George Bush before the encounter with the bureaucratic park ranger, we all know he was responsible for making the crazy rules about running the Colorado river.  Similarly have McCandless glance at the TV and watch Bush talk about the first Gulf War, that must have been part of what drove him to abandon his family.  What a load of BS!  Fortunately those are some of the worst offenses I could find and other parts such as the touching encounters with the old man who built Salvation Mountain and the reflections of Ron Franz pretty much make up for them.Anyway, I would say the DVD is only worth owning if you already own the book.  I don't think it can stand on its own merit, but rather makes a nice complementary piece.  Especially given the good acting and cinematography...  having Alaska to work with as a back drop helps a lot!",3,"Good Movie, But You Must Read the Book!",1245801600,"06 24, 2009",2009,3167,"['initially', 'had', 'intention', 'never', 'seeing', 'movie', 'reading', 'Jon', 'Krakauer', 'excellent', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'fact', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'directed', 'repulsive', 'Penn', 'made', 'want', 'barf', 'said', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'even', 'story', 'make', 'better', 'movie', 'what', 'wide', 'release', 'movies', 'pretty', 'much', 'have', 'do', 'make', 'buck.Before', 'ever', 'think', 'ordering', 'DVD', 'buy', 'book', 'read', 'couple', 'times', 'Then', 'read', 'Krakauer', 'other', 'works', 'other', 'authors', 'books', 'mountaineering', 'adventuring', ""'ll"", 'get', 'impression', 'many', 'extreme', 'adventurers', 'are', 'trying', 'fill', 'empty', 'parts', 'soul', 'challenging', 'elements', 'many', 'freely', 'admit', 'as', 'much', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'sometimes', 'are', 'able', 'find', 'peace', 'mind', 'travels', 'other', 'times', 'not.This', 'movie', 'not', 'delve', 'aspect', 'story', 'good', 'business', 'would', 'get', 'pretty', 'complicated', 'McCandless', 'personal', 'story', 'movie', 'more', 'eulogy', 'young', 'man', 'fine', 'really', 'need', 'look', 'further', 'understand', 'important', 'points', 'Krakauer', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'book.So', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'great', 'personify', 'enigmatic', 'McCandless', 'compelling', 'visuals', 'narrative', 'intriguing', 'story', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'think', 'would', 'seem', 'little', 'confusing', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'wondering', 'why', 'someone', 'so', 'naive', 'big', 'budget', 'movie', 'made', 'him.The', 'story', 'McCandless', 'not', 'unique', 'Krakauer', 'out', 'book', 'Many', 'young', 'men', 'have', 'made', 'similar', 'risky', 'treks', 'search', 'sort', 'truth', 'felt', 'was', 'not', 'realizable', 'ordinary', 'civilization', 'What', 'unique', 'fact', 'Krakauer', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'effort', 'investigating', 'trying', 'place', 'context', 'young', 'man', 'actions', 'relationships', 'lack', 'thereof', 'motivations.Since', 'was', 'somewhat', 'dysfunctional', 'adventurer', 'Krakauer', 'able', 'lend', 'authenticity', 'narrative', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'not', 'So', 'Penn', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'running', 'story', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'process', 'do', 'lose', 'most', 'crucial', 'insights', 'book.Also', 'Penn', 'can', 'not', 'resist', 'foisting', 'politics', 'very', 'awkwardly', 'film', 'let', 'pan', 'photo', 'George', 'Bush', 'encounter', 'bureaucratic', 'park', 'ranger', 'know', 'was', 'responsible', 'making', 'crazy', 'rules', 'running', 'Colorado', 'river', 'Similarly', 'have', 'McCandless', 'glance', 'TV', 'watch', 'Bush', 'talk', 'first', 'Gulf', 'War', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'what', 'drove', 'abandon', 'family', 'What', 'load', 'BS', 'Fortunately', 'are', 'worst', 'offenses', 'could', 'find', 'other', 'parts', 'such', 'touching', 'encounters', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'Salvation', 'Mountain', 'reflections', 'Ron', 'Franz', 'pretty', 'much', 'make', 'up', 'them.Anyway', 'would', 'say', 'DVD', 'only', 'worth', 'owning', 'already', 'own', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'merit', 'rather', 'nice', 'complementary', 'piece', 'Especially', 'given', 'good', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'having', 'Alaska', 'work', 'back', 'drop', 'lot']",N/A

Tell a story about a guy trying to find himself in the Alaskan wilderness. I had high hopes for this film.However, in watching this film you get the feeling that you are not being told the whole story. Something just doesn't work. The character's activities and reactions are incongruent. He is seeking love, true acceptance, and happiness. However, he does not stay in touch with his sister with whom he was very close and he does not maintain his new relationships. He then enters the Alaskan wild completely unequiped and unknowledgable about survival. Then he just dies and that's it.This movie would have been a triumph had he actually come to terms with his problems and his trip into the wilderness had been cathartic to him. Instead, you sense him slipping deeper into what was probably insanity and not reconciliing any of his issues.This movie will appeal to people wanting to return to the 1960's hippie era, and they will say that there is some cosmic meaning in it. It is a Sean Penn film, and he sure has the knack of taking inconsequential things and trying to make them something they are not.Additionally, the guy is very annoying. He meets new people (who are as emotionally needy as himself) and makes broad statements meant to sound prophetic or insightful in order to illicit emotional responses. He seemed to be a know-it-all with little life experience.As this is a true story, I feel very sorry for the man lost in the wilderness and the family left behind.

I had always thought of Chris McCandless as some sort of suicidal fool, but Penn opened my eyes to another, completely different interpretation: that McCandless was in the great tradition of American wanderers, from Daniel Boone forward, who sought distant horizons and a more intense, more direct engagement with nature and life. We're used to hearing the success stories in wilderness adventure; McCandless' story, alas, ended tragically, through a series of misfortunes and miscalculations such as (at least according to Penn) could have befallen most people in the same situation. But, as Penn shows us, McCandless' two years of wanderings across America before meeting his end in the Alaskan wilderness were quite a ride. Working from his own screenplay and with the aid of the brilliant photographer Eric Gautier, Penn presents McCandless as an intelligent, educated young man who sought escape for the usual reasons: an unhappy home life and a general disgust with the materialism of American life, particularly as represented by his family. McCandless' experiences on the way to Alaska, and the people he meets along the way, lead him finally (again, at least according to Penn) to the revelation that happiness is not a solitary emotion; it must be shared. Unfortunately, he comes to that conclusion too late. I can't help but wish that, before his journey, McCandless could have met John Haines and had the benefit of his advice. Haines, another educated young man who went to roughly the same part of Alaska as McCandless and homesteaded there successfully for the better part of 40 years, in the meantime writing some of the best American poetry of the latter half of the 20th century. (At the time McCandless left for Alaska, Haines was teaching in the Jenny McKean Moore program at George Washington University; I was one of his students there.) However much Penn's movie diverges from Krakauer's book or the reality of McCandless' life, there's no question his movie is a powerful experience, enhanced by the honest, thoughtful and emotionally direct performance of Emile Hirsch as McCandless. The supporting cast is also noteworthy, including William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden and Jena Malone as McCandless' family and Brian Dierker, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and Kristen Stewart as folks McCandless meets in his travels. The best supporting performance is by Hal Holbrook--these days looking more like T.S. Eliot than Mark Twain--as an elderly desert-dweller who takes a grandfatherly interest in McCandless.",5,"A moving, tragic story about an American adventure.",1192924800,"10 21, 2007",2007,2768,"[""'m"", 'probably', 'minority', 'having', 'gone', 'see', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'film', 'version', 'Into', 'Wild', 'having', 'first', 'read', 'Jon', 'Krakauer', 'book', 'movie', 'met', 'most', 'stringent', 'test', 'made', 'want', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'book', 'immediately', 'had', 'always', 'thought', 'Chris', 'McCandless', 'sort', 'suicidal', 'fool', 'Penn', 'opened', 'eyes', 'completely', 'different', 'interpretation', 'McCandless', 'was', 'great', 'tradition', 'American', 'wanderers', 'Daniel', 'Boone', 'forward', 'who', 'sought', 'distant', 'horizons', 'more', 'intense', 'more', 'direct', 'engagement', 'nature', 'life', ""'re"", 'used', 'hearing', 'success', 'stories', 'wilderness', 'adventure', 'McCandless', 'story', 'alas', 'ended', 'tragically', 'series', 'misfortunes', 'miscalculations', 'such', 'least', 'according', 'Penn', 'could', 'have', 'befallen', 'most', 'people', 'same', 'situation', 'Penn', 'McCandless', 'two', 'years', 'wanderings', 'America', 'meeting', 'end', 'Alaskan', 'wilderness', 'were', 'quite', 'ride', 'Working', 'own', 'screenplay', 'aid', 'brilliant', 'photographer', 'Eric', 'Gautier', 'Penn', 'McCandless', 'intelligent', 'educated', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'sought', 'escape', 'usual', 'reasons', 'unhappy', 'home', 'life', 'general', 'disgust', 'materialism', 'American', 'life', 'particularly', 'represented', 'family', 'McCandless', 'experiences', 'way', 'Alaska', 'people', 'way', 'lead', 'finally', 'again', 'least', 'according', 'Penn', 'revelation', 'happiness', 'not', 'solitary', 'emotion', 'must', 'be', 'shared', 'Unfortunately', 'conclusion', 'too', 'late', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wish', 'journey', 'McCandless', 'could', 'have', 'met', 'John', 'Haines', 'had', 'benefit', 'advice', 'Haines', 'educated', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'went', 'roughly', 'same', 'part', 'Alaska', 'McCandless', 'homesteaded', 'successfully', 'better', 'part', '40', 'years', 'meantime', 'writing', 'best', 'American', 'poetry', 'latter', 'half', '20th', 'century', 'time', 'McCandless', 'left', 'Alaska', 'Haines', 'was', 'teaching', 'Jenny', 'McKean', 'Moore', 'program', 'George', 'Washington', 'University', 'was', 'one', 'students', 'there', 'However', 'much', 'Penn', 'movie', 'Krakauer', 'book', 'reality', 'McCandless', 'life', 'question', 'movie', 'powerful', 'experience', 'enhanced', 'honest', 'thoughtful', 'emotionally', 'direct', 'performance', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'McCandless', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'including', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'McCandless', 'family', 'Brian', 'Dierker', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'folks', 'McCandless', 'meets', 'travels', 'best', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'days', 'looking', 'more', 'T.S', 'Eliot', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'elderly', 'desert-dweller', 'who', 'grandfatherly', 'interest', 'McCandless']",N/A

Sure, this film has it's faults, but it's uncanny ability to tap into viewers emotional subconscious more than makes up for the few points it loses in the style department. For instance, why Sean Penn chose to use voiceover in certain sections and handwriting on the screen in others will always allude me -- not to mention the low production quality of the title sequence. That said, it took me awhile to initially settle into the film, but once it took flight there was really no looking back. Emile Hirsch's performance is incredible; the story is wrenching; Eddie Vedder's songs perfectly compliment the material; and the whole experience lingered with me.

1123109,A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9,B000ZN802W,"NyiNya ""NyiNya""","[2, 4]","This is an excellent film, the cinematography is beautiful, the story-telling compelling, and it is based on an equally excellent book. Emile Hirsch is pitch perfect as young Christopher McCandless, a suburban kid who thinks he can go ""into the wild"" and make it his own.  Hirsch's acting is reserved but nuanced. His gestures are spare but speak volumes.  And then there's the scenery.  From the Sea of Cortez to the Grand Canyon to the Denali wilderness, it's breathtaking.  This is a movie that engrosses you from start to finish.But lordy, that Mccandless kid was a sorry piece of work. The film does not portray the boy as a hero, but neither does it delve into the selfishness of this naive young man. Many reviewers find much to admire about him him as a free spirit and 'idealist.'  Idealist my big toe.What is idealistic about willful ignorance and a sense of entitlement? The kid goes into one of the most challenging and threatening environments on the planet without having clue one about what he's getting into, without adequate supplies and without a map.  Idealism is best saved for politics and philosophy. In the wild, you need a willingness to learn. McCandless was so used to his family providing a safety net, it never occured to him that Nature would not bow to his needs as well. The movie, by the way, does hint that his parents are bad people because they offer the boy a new car when he graduates from high school and had the foresight to start a college fund for him.  We should all suffer such abuse.Chris McCandless certainly wanted people to think he was a selfless idealist, with his grandious handing over of his parent's money...not a cent of which he earned himself...to Oxfam. Plenty more where that came from, eh.  He also doesn't waste time and effort learning how to survive. ""Living off the land"" has such a nice ring to it...why lumber yourself with any useful information on how it is to be accomplished.  Naturally he becomes hopelessly lost. Naturally, after slaughtering a moose out of season, he eats a few bites and leaves the rest to rot. He doesn't even try to preserve it. What's so hard about slicing the meat thin and hanging it where the breeze hits it? It might not have worked, but he could have tried. His obliviousness is almost laughable: when he stumbles across an abandoned bus, which becomes his living quarters, he fails to connect the dots. Hello, it's a bus. Somebody drove it there, so there must be a road, probably right under the tires.  Probably the same road the bus driver used to to get out of the wilderness.Chris is no respecter of the wild, he's just lazy. Killing animals out of season impacts the species. So what. He was hungry. Even before getting to Alaska, he shows a woeful disrespect for nature; his trespassing in the Grand Canyon makes it clear he places far more importance on having fun than on preserving a wilderness.No, I don't think McCandless was an idealist. He was certainy tragic: a tragic example of a middle class, pampered child.Thoreau was an idealist and he didn't just wander blindly into the woods. He had some survival skills and certainly was wiling to learn more. Had he and the McCandless lad met, I would like to think that Henry David might have made an exception to his usual peace-loving ways.  I can picture him placing one sensible and well-worn boot on the kid's backside and propelling him back toward his natural habitat...the nearest McDonalds.",5,Thoreau would be spinning in his grave...,1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,3458,"['excellent', 'film', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'story-telling', 'compelling', 'based', 'equally', 'excellent', 'book', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'young', 'Christopher', 'McCandless', 'suburban', 'kid', 'who', 'can', 'go', 'wild', 'make', 'own', 'Hirsch', 'acting', 'reserved', 'nuanced', 'gestures', 'are', 'spare', 'speak', 'volumes', 'then', 'scenery', 'Sea', 'Cortez', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'Denali', 'wilderness', 'breathtaking', 'movie', 'start', 'finish.But', 'lordy', 'Mccandless', 'kid', 'was', 'sorry', 'piece', 'work', 'film', 'not', 'portray', 'boy', 'hero', 'neither', 'delve', 'selfishness', 'naive', 'young', 'man', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'find', 'much', 'admire', 'free', 'spirit', ""'idealist"", 'Idealist', 'big', 'toe.What', 'idealistic', 'willful', 'ignorance', 'sense', 'entitlement', 'kid', 'one', 'most', 'challenging', 'threatening', 'environments', 'planet', 'having', 'clue', 'one', 'what', 'getting', 'adequate', 'supplies', 'map', 'Idealism', 'best', 'saved', 'politics', 'philosophy', 'wild', 'need', 'willingness', 'learn', 'McCandless', 'was', 'so', 'used', 'family', 'providing', 'safety', 'net', 'never', 'occured', 'Nature', 'would', 'not', 'bow', 'needs', 'well', 'movie', 'way', 'hint', 'parents', 'are', 'bad', 'people', 'offer', 'boy', 'new', 'car', 'when', 'high', 'school', 'had', 'foresight', 'start', 'college', 'fund', 'should', 'suffer', 'such', 'abuse.Chris', 'McCandless', 'certainly', 'wanted', 'people', 'think', 'was', 'selfless', 'idealist', 'grandious', 'handing', 'parent', 'money', 'not', 'cent', 'earned', 'Oxfam', 'Plenty', 'more', 'where', 'came', 'eh', 'also', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'effort', 'learning', 'how', 'survive', 'Living', 'off', 'land', 'nice', 'ring', 'why', 'lumber', 'useful', 'information', 'how', 'be', 'accomplished', 'Naturally', 'hopelessly', 'lost', 'Naturally', 'slaughtering', 'moose', 'season', 'few', 'bites', 'rest', 'rot', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'preserve', 'What', 'so', 'hard', 'slicing', 'meat', 'thin', 'hanging', 'where', 'breeze', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'could', 'have', 'tried', 'obliviousness', 'almost', 'laughable', 'when', 'abandoned', 'bus', 'living', 'quarters', 'connect', 'dots', 'Hello', 'bus', 'Somebody', 'drove', 'there', 'must', 'be', 'road', 'probably', 'right', 'tires', 'Probably', 'same', 'road', 'bus', 'driver', 'used', 'get', 'wilderness.Chris', 'respecter', 'wild', 'just', 'lazy', 'Killing', 'animals', 'season', 'species', 'So', 'what', 'was', 'hungry', 'Even', 'getting', 'Alaska', 'woeful', 'disrespect', 'nature', 'trespassing', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'clear', 'far', 'more', 'importance', 'having', 'fun', 'preserving', 'wilderness.No', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'McCandless', 'was', 'idealist', 'was', 'certainy', 'tragic', 'tragic', 'example', 'middle', 'class', 'pampered', 'child.Thoreau', 'was', 'idealist', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'wander', 'blindly', 'woods', 'had', 'survival', 'skills', 'certainly', 'was', 'wiling', 'learn', 'more', 'Had', 'McCandless', 'lad', 'met', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'Henry', 'David', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'exception', 'usual', 'peace-loving', 'ways', 'can', 'picture', 'placing', 'one', 'sensible', 'well-worn', 'boot', 'kid', 'backside', 'propelling', 'back', 'natural', 'habitat', 'nearest', 'McDonalds']",N/A

1123111,A1SV22OU1E7XRX,B000ZN802W,ocarolan,"[11, 15]","I had not read Jon Krakauer's book, upon which this film is based, so I knew relatively little about Chris McCandless going into it. While the film did not motivate me to purchase Mr. Krakauer's book, it did motivate me to read (online) his 1993 Outside magazine article ""Death of an Innocent"" (a title that says much about Krakauer's take on the story) that was expanded into the book, and to search online for more information about Chris McCandless. There I found - among many postings: some labeling Chris McCandless a nut; others an inspirational visionary - several articles that examine Chris McCandless more objectively, I believe, than have Sean Penn or Mr. Krakauer. (In the last paragraph of this review, I identify those articles and indicate where they can be found online.) But neither this film nor anything that I have read has answered this question: What exactly did Chris McCandless do with his life for it to merit a book and a film?The film, shot on many of the locations Chris McCandless visited, looks good and the cast is strong. But gone are the complexity and ambiguity of the story that Krakauer wove, and in its place Penn gives us what he sees, apparently, as the story of a hero for our times. How you react to this film will reflect, to a significant degree, the empathy or sympathy it generates for Chris McCandless. Because it generated little of either for me, I was never pulled into Penn's vision of the story, and that made a long film (2 hours) seem, at times, endless.Who, really, was Chris McCandless? Is his story that of an iconoclast's journey of self-discovery, of a visionary's search for truth, of a young man's coming of age, of a rigid idealist whose arrogance and foolishness were his destruction, of a troubled young man's descent into the abyss? You will find supporters of each view. Krakauer's strong identification with McCandless renders him less than objective, a fact that he admitted in an interview on NPR: ""Most biographers at least pretend to be objective and unbiased, and I never pretended that.""  And as for Sean Penn, well, filmmakers have their own imperatives.Indeed, what Krakauer crafted is a well-written brief in defense of Chris McCandless. He examines plausible pieces of the puzzle that is Chris McCandless, but he is selective in the ones he uses. (Many pieces are missing and always will be.)  Krakauer dismisses, without examining in any depth, the not unreasonable suggestion that McCandless - whose rigid idealism, impossibly high standards, hostility toward his parents and alienation from society could hardly be termed normal - may have suffered from an emotional/psychological problem. What led McCandless to feel as he did is a question to which no one appears to have the answer. To diffuse criticism that McCandless had gone foolishly unprepared into the Alaskan outback, Krakauer posited, and Penn embraced, that had McCandless not mistakenly eaten a poisonous plant, he would probably have survived his trek into the wilderness. That theory was effectively shot down by chemical analyses of the two plants in question. This led Krakauer, in 2007 on Oprah and on NPR, to modify his theory: He now posits that the seeds of the wild potato that Chris McCandless ate were covered in a mold that produced an alkaloid that prevented his body from digesting food. (The entry to that affect in the botanical field guide that McCandless is shown using in the film is a fabrication.) This new theory - for which there is less evidence than the one it replaces - makes clear how committed Krakauer is to the proposition that it was bad luck, not foolhardiness, that brought McCandless down. But the preponderance of evidence, objectively weighed, suggests otherwise. Given what he carried into the bush with him and what he found there in the way of food, it is more reasonable, based on the evidence, that McCandless was slowly starving from day one, losing ground by inches, not by yards, and increasingly vulnerable to illness, accident, and miscalculation. If a calamity befell him, it was one of his own making: trying to hike out of the bush after about three months, finding the Teklanika River impassable where he had first crossed it, and, having refused to carry a map of the area, being forced to return to the bus and to slow starvation.What is the message of Chris McCandless's story? Asked that question, Jon Krakaurer invoked a litany of New Age aphorisms: It is ""about just doing something different. Get outside that comfort zone. Test yourself. Just don't be tempted to take the easiest path. Life is better when you step off that path, however far you step. Happiness is only real when shared."" Mr. Penn's assessment echoes these sentiments. But if that is the message, then I missed it. What I saw was the sad story of a privileged young man whose rigid idealism, hubris, and quest to ""kill the false being within"" (whatever that means) proved fatal, a story too narrow and too bizarre to have sweeping meaning. Sherry Simpson, in her essay ""A Man Made Cold by the Universe,"" put it more bluntly (I have thrice substituted for one of the phrases she used, so not to offend tender sensibilities and risk getting this review pulled): ""This is what bothers me -- that Christopher McCandless failed so harshly, so sadly, and yet so famously that his death has come to symbolize something admirable. ...His death was not a brilliant screw-up. It was not even a terribly original screw-up. It was just one of the more recent and more pointless screw-ups.""(A good jumping off point for online articles about Chris McCandless is ""Out of the Wild"" by Doug O'Harra, on farnorthscience.com. O'Harra's article provides links to a number of sources of information about the Chris McCandless story, including Jon Krakauer's 1993 article in Outback magazine; Krakauer's interview on NPR; Sherry Simpson's essay ""A Man Made Cold by the Universe,"" and what I found to be the most informative article, ""The Cult of Chris McCandless"" by Matthew Powers, which first appeared, in 2007, in Men's Journal magazine. It is Powers's article that is credited with prompting Krakauer to amend his poisonous plant theory. An excellent article available online is ""I Now Walk into the Wild"" by Chip Brown, first published in 1993 in The New Yorker. And an interesting analysis of aspects of the Chris McCandless story appears in ""Into the Wild Debunked"" on terraincognitafilms.com.)",2,Long day's journey to cult hero status,1207440000,"04 6,

There are messages and life lessons but there is also much meaningless behind it as a young man opts out from the rat race to try and survive in the wild but usually returns to the streets or country as a homeless vagrant before trying once again to survive the roughest of places. Each time he goes out into the wild the ruthless conditions he chooses escalate. He hopes eventually to reach Alaska for the purest wild experience he can have.Ultimately the film is about the people that the boy meets on his journey and the advice they give him and the stories they have to tell. It is also about his parents and family back home that have lost him probably due to their own domestic issues and failure to communicate. It is more than a bit of a disturbing worldview.Into the Wild is worth watching and has an art-house indie feel but is quite a depressing one because its stars are mostly down and outs and lonely. Its message could well be get a job, have a family and enjoy your 9 to 5 as much as it is about trying to be original no matter what it takes. It's a strange one and in a few ways I wish maybe I could unwatch it. Maybe it helps us become more aware of the destitute problem and for that it can be commended, but at the same time you feel very uncomfortable watching the downward spiral of its main protagonist because it is a corkscrew into misery that he is choosing.

The parents should of noticed what was happening to both their children and got them counseling, rather than push the children both onto things they did not want and living a lie as parents how much in Love they were, but were really a psychological mess themselves.Sean Penn as Director followed what the young man did and why perfectly and the cast Emile Hirsch as Chris and Marcia Gay Harden as his mother with John Hurt as his father were well cast in their roles.

So I watched it with a completely open mind.  I didn't even know that it was based on a true event, until the final closing credits.I was quickly drawn into the story.  Emile Hirsch is a very attractive, sympathetic actor and I was rooting for the hero early on.  His encounters with folks he met along the road underlined my liking for him.He was kind to everyone, gave the old guy in the phone booth a quarter, refused to take easy advantage of the cute teenage girl, and read all the right books.  His adventures before Alaska make up the best part of the film, in my opinion and I understand that these were based on letters from folks who had actually met McCandless.  Apparently he was a charismatic guy who made a big impression on people.Once he gets to the wilderness and walks in, I had the feeling this wasn't going to end all that well for him.  But I hung in there, cheering him on, even as he kept taking in his belt.  Surely, such a sunny personality as his would find a way to triumph over adversity, one would think..So, when the end came...not a pretty ending, nothing heroic, I was left feeling strangely empty.  Not sad, no tears, just...nothing.  The fake ""spiritual"" scene of the guy looking up at the light in the sky didn't do it for me....I found that sort of a cheap trick on the part of the film maker.Reading the number of critical reviews here helped me realize why I was so strangely unaffected by what should have been an extremely moving film.  I am a multi-Kleenex movie watcher but I couldn't muster one tear for this guy.  I didn't really see him as inconsiderate and lacking in love, as a number of reviewers here did.  I really understood (I thought) how his background would drive him to such desperation.  It just seemed so pointless in the end.  Did anyone learn anything?  Well, maybe, as he wrote, between the lines in one of his books, that ""happiness must be shared""...maybe that was it.  Too bad the lesson came too late.  Maybe, as the voice over of his sister claimed, that his absence had a positive effect on his warring, materialistic parents.The cast is very good, especially Katherine Keener and Hal Holbrook.  But I don't think Hirsch was the right actor for the role.  McCandless must have had a strong self-destructive nature and this doesn't come across at all in his character or performance.  Sean Penn, had he been younger, would have been great at showing both the darkness that must have been there and the charm that people spoke of.  Hirsch just looks like a really sweet kid who might live next door and whom you'd want to hire to mow your lawn.Mostly I think that the blame for the misfire of the film lies with Penn as the writer and director.  He may have attempted to portray McCandless in a neutral way but McCandless comes across as everyone's hero...the good looking, really kind, likable kid who is trying to live a pure moral existence.  It's sort of dangerous and even irresponsible, I think, to give his view of McCandless.  If Penn had aimed at a more accurate documentary style portrayal, we would have seen the character's fatal flaws earlier one.  If Penn had wanted to give us pure fiction, then a more satisfying dramatic ending would have been in order.  If the boy's death really did humanize his parents, maybe showing that would have given us some sense of resolution.  As another reviewer wrote, the way the kid dwindled away, even the bear didn't bother with him.  That's really sad, given all of the passion with which he embarked on his pilgrimage.  Reminds me of the line from  T.S. Eliot poem  about the world ending not with a bang, but with a whimper.  I would have wanted more for the real Chris McCandless.",3,It didn't quite work,1232150400,"01 17, 2009",2009,3797,"['did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'film', 'when', 'got', 'other', 'was', 'directed', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'So', 'watched', 'completely', 'open', 'mind', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'event', 'final', 'closing', 'credits.I', 'was', 'quickly', 'drawn', 'story', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'very', 'attractive', 'sympathetic', 'actor', 'was', 'rooting', 'hero', 'early', 'encounters', 'folks', 'met', 'road', 'underlined', 'liking', 'him.He', 'was', 'kind', 'everyone', 'gave', 'old', 'guy', 'phone', 'booth', 'quarter', 'refused', 'take', 'easy', 'advantage', 'cute', 'teenage', 'girl', 'read', 'right', 'books', 'adventures', 'Alaska', 'make', 'up', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'opinion', 'understand', 'were', 'based', 'letters', 'folks', 'who', 'had', 'actually', 'met', 'McCandless', 'Apparently', 'was', 'charismatic', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'big', 'impression', 'people.Once', 'wilderness', 'walks', 'had', 'feeling', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'end', 'well', 'hung', 'there', 'cheering', 'even', 'kept', 'taking', 'belt', 'Surely', 'sunny', 'personality', 'would', 'find', 'way', 'triumph', 'adversity', 'one', 'would', 'think..So', 'when', 'end', 'came', 'not', 'pretty', 'ending', 'nothing', 'heroic', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'strangely', 'empty', 'Not', 'sad', 'tears', 'just', 'nothing', 'fake', 'spiritual', 'scene', 'guy', 'looking', 'up', 'light', 'sky', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'found', 'sort', 'cheap', 'trick', 'part', 'film', 'maker.Reading', 'number', 'critical', 'reviews', 'here', 'helped', 'realize', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'strangely', 'unaffected', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'extremely', 'moving', 'film', 'am', 'multi-Kleenex', 'movie', 'watcher', 'could', ""n't"", 'muster', 'one', 'tear', 'guy', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'inconsiderate', 'lacking', 'love', 'number', 'reviewers', 'here', 'did', 'really', 'understood', 'thought', 'how', 'background', 'would', 'drive', 'such', 'desperation', 'just', 'seemed', 'so', 'pointless', 'end', 'Did', 'anyone', 'learn', 'anything', 'Well', 'maybe', 'wrote', 'lines', 'one', 'books', 'happiness', 'must', 'be', 'shared', 'maybe', 'was', 'Too', 'bad', 'lesson', 'came', 'too', 'late', 'Maybe', 'voice', 'sister', 'claimed', 'absence', 'had', 'positive', 'effect', 'warring', 'materialistic', 'parents.The', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'Katherine', 'Keener', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Hirsch', 'was', 'right', 'actor', 'role', 'McCandless', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'strong', 'self-destructive', 'nature', ""n't"", 'come', 'character', 'performance', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'had', 'been', 'younger', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'showing', 'darkness', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'charm', 'people', 'spoke', 'Hirsch', 'just', 'really', 'sweet', 'kid', 'who', 'might', 'live', 'next', 'door', 'whom', ""'d"", 'want', 'hire', 'mow', 'lawn.Mostly', 'think', 'blame', 'misfire', 'film', 'Penn', 'writer', 'director', 'may', 'have', 'attempted', 'portray', 'McCandless', 'neutral', 'way', 'McCandless', 'everyone', 'hero', 'good', 'looking', 'really', 'kind', 'likable', 'kid', 'who', 'trying', 'live', 'pure', 'moral', 'existence', 'sort', 'dangerous', 'even', 'irresponsible', 'think', 'give', 'view', 'McCandless', 'Penn', 'had', 'aimed', 'more', 'accurate', 'documentary', 'style', 'portrayal', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'character', 'fatal', 'flaws', 'earlier', 'one', 'Penn', 'had', 'wanted', 'give', 'pure', 'fiction', 'then', 'more', 'satisfying', 'dramatic', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'order', 'boy', 'death', 'really', 'did', 'humanize', 'parents', 'maybe', 'showing', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'sense', 'resolution', 'reviewer', 'wrote', 'way', 'kid', 'dwindled', 'away', 'even', 'bear', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'really', 'sad', 'given', 'passion', 'embarked', 'pilgrimage', 'line', 'T.S', 'Eliot', 'poem', 'world', 'ending', 'not', 'bang', 'whimper', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'more', 'real', 'Chris', 'McCandless']",N/A

Or is it just the tale of an ultimately delusional kid that could never shake the emotional and psychological scars of a broken home?  Perhaps because the movie works at so many levels is its ultimate genius.

The closest person to express this is Mr. Holbrooke's widowed character, who incidentally is the last person that comes into contact with McCandless before Alaska.

He completely disappears from the lives of his family members for two years without a word.  Along the way he makes friends but just vanishes from their lives as well.  I saw a young man leaving behind a trail of broken hearts all because of his ""free spirit"" and intense yearning to live in the Alaskan wilderness.Anyone who's done studies and research on runaways will find that the vast majority of them come from upper middle-class families.  Alexander was about as prepared for life in the wilderness as Bill Gates would be if he went to live in Compton or Baltimore City.  Mother Nature kicked his butt...and then some.  In the end, he learned his lessons and was far less self-assured and cocky. Albeit far too late.

He survives by tending to odd jobs and living in the wilderness until his fateful decision to head to Alaska.  He meets some amazing people along the way, but rejects them all.  What struck me about the young man is that he adopts the same emotional shallowness that he has tried to escape from his own parents.  In his embrace of nature and wilderness, he ends up finding his final shelter in a deserted bus that ultimatey becomes his grave.  One cannot but notice that young Christopher McCandless at his very end, becomes what he has tried altogether to escape. Wheather or not we have money and comfortable lives, without human tenderness, love and emotional connections, we are simply empty shells.

Despite his checkered past in Hollywood (bad-boy image, married to Madonna, etc.), I've been a fan since his directorial debut, ""The Indian Runner"", introducing the world to Viggo Mortenson. Smart move; great film. There is little I can say that hasn't been said. The episodic nature of the narrative is a good thing; Mr. McCandless certainly found the adventure he was seeking, and his reflections and flashbacks fill in most of the holes. It's brilliantly acted, and the top-notch cast, most relegated to short screen time, fulfill the requirements. Most impressive of all is the focused, centered and determined performance of Emile Hirsch. There's not a glitch in the committment of his character. His resemblance to Leo di Caprio is profound. Certainly, everyone thinks, at one time, to get away from it all. Mr. McCandless certainly had that idea, and ran with it. Unfortunately, it wasn't well imagined for him,  and his dream was not fruitful.Some might think that re-imagining yourself would be productive, but there are too many factors involved that must be considered: love, memories, friends, accountability; it's presented well, and non-judgmental.

1123140,ABBBP0HLLXJZ9,B000ZN802W,"Rhonda Poynter ""gannon'smom""","[4, 5]","A decade ago, shortly after losing a friend in a plane crash and going through the hell of waiting for wreckage to be found, etc., I read the book that this movie is based on. Between wondering what had become of my friend and reading of Chris McCandless and his travels, I wrote a long poem for a literary journal, ""Gone"", which is reprinted to this day, and when asked, I always explain where Chris McCandless comes into it. I have received some feedback, then, from fans and defenders of this young man, and before I comment on the movie, I have to say this: I am a great admirer of Chris', although, somewhere, somehow, some way, I wonder whether he could have did things differently, to insure his safety and to spare his family the grief and loss they have gone through since his death. I will never bad-mouth anybody who goes in search of their dreams, their reason and their vision, and if more of us in this world did stay true to ourselves, and believe that what we want for ourselves is right and true, critics be damned, I think that we'd be a much happier lot, and not so inclined to be flipping each other off on the freeway or hating our neighbors for parking in our spaces. But - I lost a friend that wasn't found, much like Chris, for weeks, and it was one of the most gut-wrenching, heartbreaking situations I have ever experienced. To lay awake and wonder where somebody is, whether they are safe, whether they are thinking of you - it's a killer. And so, I just really want to stress: I think that Chris was somewhat a misguided angel, and he doesn't deserve the ridicule and negativity sent his way. But I also think that his situation should be used as a touchstone for anybody else thinking of trying something like this - think, plan, take supplies with you. And this is coming from a mother: Call home if you can, let somebody know that the trip is going all right and that you're a big boy/girl, now, and everyone needs to chill out.I more than openly write about my background and am known for stating that my parents shouldn't have raised corn, much less kids, but even they, IMO, deserved to know what was going on. I'm telling you, nobody should end up hurting like the survivors always end up hurting. Ok, the movie. Brilliant, absolutely brilliant, from the writing and direction, to  acting to the photography. Sean Penn has created a masterpiece with this film, and it's obvious that he loves the subject of the movie, Chris McCandless, as much as Chris' supporters continue to do. The movie respects the book by Jon Krakauer - the characters are more fleshed out in the film than the book, but it works here. Some movies should stay unflinchingly true to the book that came before them, but Penn wisely brought to life Chris' family, their moments of comprehension of Chris (granted, very few, it seems, other than for the loyalty shown to Chris by his sister), hangups, warts and all. I especially have more compassion for his parents after watching the movie than I did while reading the book (again, everybody is a jerk in some way, I'm a jerk more often than I care to admit); I think that it's important that the film showed the 'other side' of the story, because if you only read the book, it's pretty easy to make a pretty harsh call about a couple of Chris' family members. William Hurt brings humanity to be a very unlikable individual, and Marcia Gay Harden, as Chris' mother, is shown to have layers to her personality that Chris, being young and disillusioned, may not have caught. Again, I may personalize this movie more than I should when it comes to some facts in the McCandless family as related to my own life (the scenes of Chris' sister Carine, and the over voice narration by the actress portraying her are shattering to me, as my own brother died at 20, and I continue to think many of the thoughts Carine offers), but this is that kind of movie. You're going to see it because you can identify with the Chris character, and you long to walk off into anonymity and self-survival/preservation, or you're going to see it because you've had something even close to it touch your own life, and you want to see how others handle the loss, heartache and uncertainty. It actually is a film where the actors could have been swallowed up by the people they are portraying, and so it says something that Emile Hirsche is astonishing as Chris, William Hurt brings more to his role as Chris' father than just our wanting to blame him for everything that would come about, and, as I said, I really, really liked the actress Jena Malone as the movie's narrator/Chris' sister. Hal Holbrook had the misfortune to be nominated for an Oscar the same year the late Heath Ledger rightfully won for his portrayal as The Joker; any other year, I think that Hal would have taken it for his turn as the old man, Ron, whom Chris tries to urge back to Life, to Experience. Vince Vaughn is great for his few scenes - as I said, the movie, IMO, is flawless. The music by We're-Not-Worthy Eddie Vedder is fantastic. In closing, this movie, and the young man whom inspired it, will continue to be argued and disputed for some time to come. I think that if you want to watch it, you should, and if you think people like Chris McCandless should be eyed with the same skepticism as ghosts and UFOs, then you should steer clear. But don't trash a dead man because he followed his dreams - like I said, maybe more of us should be that true to ourselves. I loved the movie and the book, and I admire the man for trying to do what he felt he had to do.",5,The Movie: Brilliant - The Young Man Lost: Depends On How You See It,1286841600,"10 12,

He was so focused on Alaska that he missed so many things along the way, he missed something he finally learned, RELATIONSHIPS.You can live your life day by day, but in his search for happiness, he missed the potential happines right in front of him.There are many points of this movie that I think people missed, I won't continue writing because I'll never stop and I hate way too long reviews.People can learn things from everyone and everything.

Only he turns on them and sets out to deliberately bring them pain they don't deserve.The book is ok for high school kids.

Thus, however close a physical resemblance Emile Hersch has to the 'real' guy, we have an endearing, gritty, open, call it naive,guy, on a journey of self-discovery. He acted like a teener, so I was surpised to find he was 23. I willed the spirited adventurer on in the hope that his quest for 'Truth', over love and its attending virtues, would help him survive his 100 days in the wilderness. The previous two years on the road have been a full on exposure to life beyond the suburbs and family. It's not the film's province to investigate the motives for his radical disavowal of capitalist 'trappings', sustaining friendships, and rebuttal of his family(who don't seem more messed up than most. Eddie Vedder's emotive baritone fits well, echoing our heroe's moves with subtle understatment: some of the best work I've heard from him. It seems only a short distance into the wild before he encounters the body of an abandoned bus which, providentially, provides the shelter which will finally entomb him. It's not the kind of 'wild' protection I'd anticipated. Didn't he have a tent? Whatever, as the food stocks dwindle and the belt draws tighter, his ignorance of any smattering of bush knowledge is painfully evident. Guilt over wasting a moose. Get over it. You eat cooked,flyblown meat when desperate. At least some of it. I've had to. And no attempt to see what fish the river offered. And, oddly, no wondering or wandering along the track the bus must have arrived on. A doomed trajectory. This guy will perish.We're inexorably drawn to the fatal hours, the collapse, the scribbled epitaph, expiration and heavenward gaze. No matter what license the Penn team may have taken with 'fact', the 'truth' of the movie is satisfying, if not for his grieving family.

1123145,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000ZN802W,RMurray847,"[11, 19]","Let me come right and admit that I dislike Sean Penn a great deal.  His politics are infantile, silly and represent Hollywood's penchant for knee-jerk liberalism at its worst.  His trips to Iraq are an embarrassment.But let me also admit that he truly is an artist to be reckoned with.  From his wonderful performances in FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH through is Oscar-winning work on MYSTIC RIVER, he has proven himself a unique talent.  And now his skills as a director cannot be overlooked either.  His past efforts as a director had merit, but with films like THE PLEDGE, he allowed himself an indulgent pace, and the movies meandered a bit.  They still showed skill...but only now, with INTO THE WILD, can he truly be called a director of importance.Based on the terrific book from Jon Krakauer (who also wrote the MUST READ ""Into Thin Air""), INTO THE WILD follows the true-story of Chris McCandless, a young man who drops out of life in a serious, disturbed way.McCandless comes from a family of privilege.  Raised in the south, we see him graduating from prestigious Emory College, and telling his folks he's thinking of Harvard Law.  He clearly has a lot of issues with his folks and their materialism...but at first blush, he seems like little more than an upstart college kid who was raised in a cushy enough life to be able to readily shower disdain on money & materialism.  A poor kid would never do this.  He seems very close to his younger sister (Jena Malone), as they are united in their disregard for their parents (Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt).Turns out, Chris is going to drop out of their lives completely.  He gives away all his money and sets out on the road with his beat-up car, eager to ""see America"" and to live off the land (although frankly, living off the land for him seems to require lots of begging for money, taking handouts and eventually, when his car is trashed, accepting rides).  He even changes his name to Alexander Supertramp.  He's a drop-out on a mission to erase his past life as well.  He NEVER touches base with his family, even his beloved sister.Eventually, he becomes more and more eager to tear himself away from the trappings of civilization, and he goes to the wilderness of Alaska, IN THE WINTER to live on his own.  He has almost no survival skills, and if not for stumbling upon an abandoned bus that had obviously once been used as a campsite, he probably would have died in a day or two.  As it is, his time in Alaska stretches on for weeks or months, and that's all I want to tell you, in case you didn't know how this story turns out.Chris (or Alex) is a supremely annoying character to me.  I'm a man in my 40s with kids of my own, and so naturally I bristle at his cavalier hatred for his parents.  And I'm also annoyed at his thoughts on dropping out, which as I said seemed to involve mooching off of others.  As though our society owed it to him to support his noble desire to have no possessions, responsibilities, etc. etc.But here's the surprising thing...as much as part of me disliked this young man and his questionable mission, I was drawn deeper and deeper into caring about what happened to him nonetheless.  Penn, and especially his young star, Emilie Hirsch, do a masterful job over the films 2.5 hour running time of making you empathize with this guy.As we learn more about his relationship with his parents, we see that while he might be over-reacting, he does have legitimate gripes that go deeper than we thought at first.  He's trying to erase his identify, because it's been built on a lie in the first place.  He truly wants to strip away anything that reminds him of them and their world.  At first, just distance helps...but he begins to see that he himself needs to be laid bare.  He has an almost primal need, not to commune with nature, but to use that communion as a way of reducing him to just basic needs for food and shelter.  And at the end of the film, when we see that he has finally succeeded and has finally come full circle, it's a shattering moment.  Only then do we see the skill with which Penn (who also wrote the script) and Hirsch have led us.  We thought we knew what McCandless wanted from his journey...but what he came to was something different indeed.Most of the movie deals with McCandless' encounters with the various people he meets.  He spends time working on a wheat harvesting crew run by Vince Vaughan.  He lives for several months with Catherine Keener and her husband in a desert in Arizona.  And most touchingly, he befriends a old veteran played by Hal Holbrook.  It's nice to see Vaughan play a normal guy at more or less a normal level of energy, rather than his over-the-top antic-ness.  But it is Keener and Holbrook who threaten to steal the show.  Keener plays a ""hippie"" who has dropped out of life to get away from a terrible sadness of her own.  She has a burden she carries that makes her both love McCandless like a mother AND to understand the grief McCandless's mother must be going through.  She infuses her character with sadness and toughness in equal measure.  It's an almost perfect role for Keener, who has an almost unique quality to her...one of smarts, sexiness, sadness and empathy.  I think there's a fair chance she'll be nominated for an Oscar.  An almost slam-dunk Oscar nomination for Hal Holbrook, however.  It feels like years since I've seen him in anything, and the 20 minutes or so he is in this movie are as quietly powerful as any 20 minutes I've seen this year.  His character has shut off from the world and lived in insulated sadness for decades.  McCandless comes into his life and shows him that the world still has something to offer him.  Holbrook responds and begins to open up.  He takes on physical tasks he didn't dare before.  But he also begins to love the young man who has brought him this renewal...and he knows this kid is going to leave soon and never be seen again.  Holbrook is masterful in his scenes, and his final few moments are quite powerful.Another aspect of this movie to be savored is the sheer enjoyment of the beautiful American scenery.  We're taken all over the western half of our nation, and also to Alaska, and Penn allows plenty of time to take in the sights.  What a beautiful country the US is!!The movie is not perfect.  Sometimes Hirsch relies a little too much on just smiling beatifically at people, and the almost reverent response they have towards him is a bit much.  He does become a character that the viewer cares about...but sometimes Penn plays him off as too ""pure.""  He seems to have no interest in sex, for example...and this interesting aspect of his character is left unexplored and unexplained.  (Also, I got tired of Eddie Vedder's songs...his diction is so bad, it just sounded like whining.  And this is from a guy who sorta likes Pearl Jam.)This is a broadly sweeping movie about a very tiny subject...one troubled man whose journey of self-discovery led him in unexpected ways.  In the great scheme of life, it isn't terribly important.  Yet it reminds us that the human heart is unfathomable, that reactions aren't predictable AND most importantly, that we can grow and learn and come to accept what life has dealt us.  The movie is sad, yet quite uplifting.  It is a movie that finds forgiveness and redemption in unexpected places.So, it is with some chagrin that I must say I highly recommend this effort from Sean Penn.",5,Strong film-making...really liked

On the surface, the journey appears self-destructive, thus, in every encounter he is forced to explain his purpose to otherwise skeptical observers.In doing so, he not only finds the purpose for his journey but the purpose for his frustratingly confusing life.  Once he finally figures it all out, his death becomes all the more tragic because he is unable to either share or apply his new, enlightened perspective.Along the way, he is both teacher and student.  His bold search for personal truth inspires others to do the same.  He ignites their previously unexamined lives, and they revere him for it.  He also soaks in valuable wisdom from others along the way.By observing McCandless' search for meaning, the viewer can't help but ask himself the same existential questions.  Thus, the film's value lies in its ability to evoke the same questions in the audience as it did in the characters McCandless meets along the way.Outstanding cinematography and a beautiful soundtrack further add to this fine film.

1123149,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000ZN802W,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 4]","*SPOILERS*Who among us hasn't, at one time or another, dreamed of one day chucking the whole ""corporate rat race/adult responsibility"" thing and moving to an isolated cabin in the woods where we would be free to get in touch with our inner selves and become one with nature?  Yet, even though many of us have fantasized about doing such a thing, few of us have had the intestinal fortitude or psychological wherewithal to actually go out and do it.  Well, Christopher McCandless actually DID go out and do it - though with sadly tragic results for both the young man and those dearest to him.At the age of 22, McCandless could have had the life of privilege, comfort and financial success natural to someone who had just graduated with honors from a prestigious institution like Emory University (especially one with wealthy parents).  Instead, he chose a different path for himself, one that would reject the materialistic values of the world around him and send him on a journey of self-discovery which, despite the best of intentions, would prove fatal to him in the long run.  Over a two-year period, from 1990 to 1992, Chris traveled all across North America - on foot, by kayak, by bumming rides off strangers - finally ending up in the wilderness of Alaska where he was to meet his tragic fate.  Along the way, he encountered numerous colorful characters who made a mark on his heart.  This adventure was popularized in the best-selling book ""Into the Wild"" by Jon Krakauer, who reconstructed McCandless' experiences largely from notes and journal entries left behind by the young man and through interviews with certain key players in the drama.For the movie version, writer/director Sean Penn has made Chris' devoted sister, Carine, the narrator and chief commentator on the action.  It is through her reflections that we come to understand some of the reasoning behind Chris' remarkable willingness to forego all the creature comforts of the modern world that the rest of us seem to cling to so tenaciously.  As with any tale of a picaresque nature, ""Into the Wild"" is more a series of vignettes than a fully fleshed-out drama, and, thus, it has an occasional tendency to ramble and wander aimlessly.  Yet, its narrative looseness is clearly a large part of the story's charm.  Moreover, Penn keeps it tightly knit together through the narration, the use of flashbacks, the scenes involving Chris' parents, and the mesmerizing fluidity of the camerawork.  And, naturally, the evocative, richly variegated landscapes against which the story unfolds play a crucial role in the overall richness of the film.Some have charged the movie with romanticizing and glorifying an individual who was arguably sociopathic and whose actions and decisions ultimately led to his own death.  Yet, while Penn clearly wants us to identify with Chris' sense of idealism and carpe diem spirit, the filmmaker also acknowledges that there are some serious psychological issues at play here, mostly brought on by the young man's being raised by two obviously dysfunctional parents.  Yet, the movie is also about how important it is for us to forgive those who have wronged us and to not allow bitterness to determine the course of our lives.With his boyish looks and unprepossessing manner, Emile Hirsch embodies the devil-may-care spirit of what is, essentially, a 20th Century version of Henry David Thoreau.  In relatively small but crucial roles, William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden leave an indelible mark as Chris's parents.  The many individuals he meets along the way are embodied by Brian H. Dierker, Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, and, most memorably, Hal Holbrook, heartbreaking in his Oscar-nominated performance as an old desert-dweller who offers to adopt Chris as his son.In the end, ""Into the Wild"" can be read as much as a cautionary tale as one championing the cause of unbridled individuality.  Like ""Grizzly Man,"" it shows how an obsession with nature and an unrealistic disdain for civilization can lead to disastrous consequences for individuals unequipped to deal with the harsh realities of the natural world.  If anything, both films serve as a call for reasonableness and balance in determining mankind's proper place in the overall scheme of things.",4,Exploring Man's Place in Nature,1210982400,"05 17, 2008",2008,4262,"['*SPOILERS*Who', ""n't"", 'one', 'time', 'dreamed', 'one', 'day', 'chucking', 'whole', 'corporate', 'rat', 'race/adult', 'responsibility', 'thing', 'moving', 'isolated', 'cabin', 'woods', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'free', 'get', 'touch', 'inner', 'selves', 'become', 'one', 'nature', 'even', 'many', 'have', 'fantasized', 'doing', 'such', 'thing', 'few', 'have', 'had', 'intestinal', 'fortitude', 'psychological', 'wherewithal', 'actually', 'go', 'out', 'do', 'Well', 'Christopher', 'McCandless', 'actually', 'DID', 'go', 'out', 'do', 'sadly', 'tragic', 'results', 'young', 'man', 'dearest', 'him.At', 'age', '22', 'McCandless', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'life', 'privilege', 'comfort', 'financial', 'success', 'natural', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'graduated', 'honors', 'prestigious', 'institution', 'Emory', 'University', 'especially', 'one', 'wealthy', 'parents', 'Instead', 'chose', 'different', 'path', 'one', 'would', 'reject', 'materialistic', 'values', 'world', 'send', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'best', 'intentions', 'would', 'prove', 'fatal', 'long', 'run', 'two-year', 'period', '1990', '1992', 'Chris', 'traveled', 'North', 'America', 'foot', 'kayak', 'bumming', 'rides', 'strangers', 'finally', 'ending', 'up', 'wilderness', 'Alaska', 'where', 'was', 'meet', 'tragic', 'fate', 'way', 'encountered', 'numerous', 'colorful', 'characters', 'who', 'made', 'mark', 'heart', 'adventure', 'was', 'popularized', 'best-selling', 'book', 'Wild', 'Jon', 'Krakauer', 'who', 'reconstructed', 'McCandless', 'experiences', 'largely', 'notes', 'journal', 'entries', 'left', 'behind', 'young', 'man', 'interviews', 'certain', 'key', 'players', 'drama.For', 'movie', 'version', 'writer/director', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'made', 'Chris', 'devoted', 'sister', 'Carine', 'narrator', 'chief', 'commentator', 'action', 'reflections', 'come', 'understand', 'reasoning', 'Chris', 'remarkable', 'willingness', 'forego', 'creature', 'comforts', 'modern', 'world', 'rest', 'seem', 'cling', 'so', 'tenaciously', 'tale', 'picaresque', 'nature', 'Wild', 'more', 'series', 'vignettes', 'fully', 'fleshed-out', 'drama', 'thus', 'occasional', 'tendency', 'ramble', 'wander', 'aimlessly', 'narrative', 'looseness', 'clearly', 'large', 'part', 'story', 'charm', 'Moreover', 'Penn', 'tightly', 'together', 'narration', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Chris', 'parents', 'mesmerizing', 'fluidity', 'camerawork', 'naturally', 'evocative', 'richly', 'variegated', 'landscapes', 'story', 'unfolds', 'play', 'crucial', 'role', 'overall', 'richness', 'film.Some', 'have', 'charged', 'movie', 'romanticizing', 'glorifying', 'individual', 'who', 'was', 'arguably', 'sociopathic', 'actions', 'decisions', 'ultimately', 'led', 'own', 'death', 'Penn', 'clearly', 'identify', 'Chris', 'sense', 'idealism', 'carpe', 'diem', 'spirit', 'filmmaker', 'also', 'are', 'serious', 'psychological', 'issues', 'play', 'here', 'mostly', 'brought', 'young', 'man', 'being', 'raised', 'two', 'obviously', 'dysfunctional', 'parents', 'movie', 'also', 'how', 'important', 'forgive', 'who', 'have', 'wronged', 'not', 'allow', 'bitterness', 'determine', 'course', 'lives.With', 'boyish', 'looks', 'unprepossessing', 'manner', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'devil-may-care', 'spirit', 'what', 'essentially', '20th', 'Century', 'version', 'Henry', 'David', 'Thoreau', 'relatively', 'small', 'crucial', 'roles', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'leave', 'indelible', 'mark', 'Chris', 'parents', 'many', 'individuals', 'way', 'are', 'embodied', 'Brian', 'H.', 'Dierker', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'most', 'memorably', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'heartbreaking', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'old', 'desert-dweller', 'who', 'adopt', 'Chris', 'son.In', 'end', 'Wild', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'as', 'much', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'one', 'championing', 'cause', 'unbridled', 'individuality', 'Grizzly', 'Man', 'how', 'obsession', 'nature', 'unrealistic', 'disdain', 'civilization', 'can', 'lead', 'disastrous', 'consequences', 'individuals', 'unequipped', 'deal', 'harsh', 'realities', 'natural', 'world', 'anything', 'films', 'serve', 'call', 'reasonableness', 'balance', 'determining', 'mankind', 'proper', 'place', 'overall', 'scheme', 'things']",N/A

1123152,A387BD735MI50R,B000ZN802W,R. Schultz,"[2, 4]","I knew what the general subject of this film was going in. What I hadn't been prepared for was how much of this young man's emotional journey paralleled that of so many people I've known. You'll also likely to be surprised to see your friends, yourself, in this rebellion.Of course, the people you've known probably didn't go quite so fatefully far in distancing themselves from all the cluttering ""stuff"" of urban society. But surely, we're all acquainted with young people who vanished into their own worlds, at least for a while - leaving their parents to anguish over their whereabouts. And this movie will probably also make a lot of viewers realize how many young people they've known who, like Chris McCandless, silently suffered from, resented, and actually loathed, the essential lack of love between their parents - who rebelled against their parents' fractured, messy marital backgrounds. ""Into the Wild"" underscores the often-repeated wisdom that the greatest gift parents can give their children - is not things, and in fact not even first-and-foremost a doting love of those children - but an abiding love for each other.Clearly though, McCandless cut family ties without being sufficiently prepared to survive in the wilderness. More than his lack of knowledge about hunting for animals and edible plants, he had an unfortunate lack of knowledge about Thoreau, the spiritual mentor whom he was following into solitude. When I myself was once rhapsodizing about Thoreau's philosophy, a friend of mine deflated my admiration slightly by telling me that Walden was actually just a stone's throw away from Thoreau's family house, and that Thoreau's mother came out to his cabin frequently, with meals and cookies she'd baked for him - and probably also to do his laundry. I wanted to shout at the screen to McCandless to heed this seldom-mentioned aspect of Thoreau's retreat into nature. Thoreau was definitely working with a net.Despite the tragedy though, this movie is truly life-affirming. In contrast with so many movies made now where there is really no one to like - here everyone is a hearteningly decent, likable person. McCandless didn't encounter one sociopathic serial killer on the road - almost unheard of in recent decades. Hal Holbrook does an exceptionally brilliant, touching turn as an older man who briefly serves as a way-station for McCandless. Although Holbrook's role is barely more than a cameo appearance, it's a portrayal that will undoubtedly stick in your memory as one of the most poignant ever captured on film.The whole movie is brilliantly photographed.

McCandless was able to form quick friendships which were more deep and sincere on the parts of the other people, his were rather more superficial at that point in time. He was filled with the angst and implacable censoriousness of youth and none of the appreciation for the fallibility of people, e.g., his own parents. Ostensibly it was the revelation that his father had continued relations with his first wife while married to his second and this sin, in McCandless's eyes, colored his entire life including his education, a career and any and all ""things"" that were in any way reminiscent of his parents. He nursed a cold rage against his father especially and used this revelation to justify his extreme callousness and carelessness toward his entire family including the sister he was so fond of and the abandoment of his car, a vehicle he supposedly treasured. He planned to inflict the ultimate hurt against his family by plotting his own disappearance and was so focused on this goal he lost sight of right and wrong and only considered his own wants which doomed him to die of starvation alone in the wilderness.His arrogant, brash nickname ""Alexander Supertramp"" was another symptom of his hubris which ultimately seared his family with sorrow and drove him to a cold and lonely death in the old bus with no one around to comfort him in his last moments. He had fun playing the adventurer, for a while, then when he faced the reality of the situation he placed himself in, the fun and adventure vanished and he was left only with his very bad decisions. He went into a cold, forbidding environment virtually unprepared and without any supplies to speak of; tiny changes to his venture would have ensured his survival but it was not to be. Something as simple as slicing thin strips of the moose he killed and air drying them as opposed to smoking the meat and ending up with a maggot filled mess. Carrying beef jerky and dried fruit with him would have helped, pretty much any common care would have resulted in life instead of death and I do not believe for one second he intended or wanted to die. But he chose to ignore wise advice from people who had successfully gone into the wilderness and tried to give him the benefit of their own experiences...he even refused one man who offered to take him to buy adequate supplies. McCandless refused. It is a waste, it is not romantic at all, it is a tragedy and all the young men and women who find this event adventurous and exciting and worship McCandless and deify him are all sadly mistaken. The film was excellent and the music and actors all superb, but ultimately it describes a vengeful, angry, selfish, self centered young man who harbored a horrible grudge against his family and never even discussed this with them, but chose to plot to wreak revenge on them instead, which he did succeed at, his only success in this doomed adventure.",5,DOOMED BY HIS OWN HUBRIS AND LACK OF COMPASSION,1236470400,"03 8, 2009",2009,2925,"['own', 'family', 'McCandless', 'was', 'able', 'form', 'quick', 'friendships', 'were', 'more', 'deep', 'sincere', 'parts', 'other', 'people', 'were', 'rather', 'more', 'superficial', 'point', 'time', 'was', 'filled', 'angst', 'implacable', 'censoriousness', 'youth', 'none', 'appreciation', 'fallibility', 'people', 'e.g.', 'own', 'parents', 'was', 'revelation', 'father', 'had', 'continued', 'relations', 'first', 'wife', 'married', 'second', 'sin', 'McCandless', 'eyes', 'colored', 'entire', 'life', 'including', 'education', 'career', 'things', 'were', 'way', 'reminiscent', 'parents', 'nursed', 'cold', 'rage', 'father', 'especially', 'used', 'revelation', 'justify', 'extreme', 'callousness', 'carelessness', 'entire', 'family', 'including', 'sister', 'was', 'so', 'fond', 'abandoment', 'car', 'vehicle', 'supposedly', 'treasured', 'planned', 'inflict', 'ultimate', 'hurt', 'family', 'plotting', 'own', 'disappearance', 'was', 'so', 'focused', 'goal', 'lost', 'sight', 'right', 'wrong', 'only', 'considered', 'own', 'doomed', 'die', 'starvation', 'alone', 'wilderness.His', 'arrogant', 'brash', 'nickname', 'Alexander', 'Supertramp', 'was', 'symptom', 'hubris', 'ultimately', 'seared', 'family', 'sorrow', 'drove', 'cold', 'lonely', 'death', 'old', 'bus', 'one', 'around', 'comfort', 'last', 'moments', 'had', 'fun', 'playing', 'adventurer', 'while', 'then', 'when', 'faced', 'reality', 'situation', 'placed', 'fun', 'adventure', 'vanished', 'was', 'left', 'only', 'very', 'bad', 'decisions', 'went', 'cold', 'forbidding', 'environment', 'virtually', 'unprepared', 'supplies', 'speak', 'tiny', 'changes', 'venture', 'would', 'have', 'ensured', 'survival', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'Something', 'as', 'simple', 'slicing', 'thin', 'strips', 'moose', 'killed', 'air', 'drying', 'opposed', 'smoking', 'meat', 'ending', 'up', 'maggot', 'filled', 'mess', 'Carrying', 'beef', 'jerky', 'dried', 'fruit', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'pretty', 'much', 'common', 'care', 'would', 'have', 'resulted', 'life', 'instead', 'death', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'one', 'second', 'intended', 'wanted', 'die', 'chose', 'ignore', 'wise', 'advice', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'successfully', 'gone', 'wilderness', 'tried', 'give', 'benefit', 'own', 'experiences', 'even', 'refused', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'offered', 'take', 'buy', 'adequate', 'supplies', 'McCandless', 'refused', 'waste', 'not', 'romantic', 'tragedy', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'find', 'event', 'adventurous', 'exciting', 'worship', 'McCandless', 'deify', 'are', 'sadly', 'mistaken', 'film', 'was', 'excellent', 'music', 'actors', 'superb', 'ultimately', 'vengeful', 'angry', 'selfish', 'centered', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'harbored', 'horrible', 'grudge', 'family', 'never', 'even', 'discussed', 'chose', 'plot', 'wreak', 'revenge', 'instead', 'did', 'succeed', 'only', 'success', 'doomed', 'adventure']",N/A
1123160,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B000ZN802W,Sean Pasek,"[2, 5]","This may be one of the best films that I have seen in the last few years, and Sean Penn may well have directed his masterpiece in this incredibly moving and powerful true story of a young man who seeks him Self in an epic journey.Chris McCandless is a young man who has just graduated from college.  He has nearly $25,000 in savings.  His family is hoping he will use it toward a Harvard education.  Instead, he does the unthinkable: he gives all but a few hundred to charity, sets off on a trek around the country and eventually burns the last bit of money that he has left.  Crazy?  Perhaps...to us, anyway.""Life begins OUTSIDE of your comfort zone"" --Conversations With God. This quote applies to Chris because he's chosen not play life ""safe."" He wants to live, and to engage in new experiences often means taking risks. From the start of his journey, Chris does this nearly every day.The journey of Chris ""Alexander Supertramp"" McCandless is one of the most powerful journeys of man: it is the journey of letting go.  He decides to return to a state of simplicity by removing virtually all of his worldly possessions and attachments, except for the basic necessities.  He does not wish to be bogged down by conformity and the hypocrisy of human relationships any longer, and so he leaves his family and everything he knows behind.The irony of letting go is that it is tantamount with healing and with Self discovery.  Chris meets a number of people throughout his journey.  They all seem to be touched by this simple and yet wise young man who brings with him a powerful, healing energy whether those he interacts with are aware of it or not.Perhaps the most touching meeting of all, is the last one shown with Ron Franz (Hal Holbrook in an especially sweet performance) as an old man living in the Anza-Borrego desert of Southern California.  Chris challenges Ron to not give up on life and new experiences just because he's old, and to not give in to the illusion that human relationships are the principle form of happiness.  We see the sparkle of realization in Ron's eyes as the truth sinks in.  Ron is so taken with Chris that he wants to adopt him.  Chris simply tells him that they can talk about it when he returns from Alaska.  It's at this point that Ron realizes that Chris belongs to no one except himself even though he knows that Chris, indeed, loves him.  Chris knows that a truly loving relationship is about letting go, not holding on, and it's evident that this is the only type of relationship that he has with each and every person he meets and comes across.Chris is like a modern day Thoreau (which ironically he read a lot of including Tolstoy, London, and other writers).  He goes into the wilds of Alaska to live deliberately and simply in order to gain further insight and wisdom as to who he is and what life is really all about.  It is no surprise that when he finally passes away, it is with a smile on his face because he knows that he has truly lived.The performance of Emile Hirsch is a fantastic one.  He plays the role simply, much like how the real Chris McCandless must have been.  It's as if he understands what it must have been like to know Chris and he incorporates that knowledge into the role.Jena Malone (as Chris's sister) is equally important as she narrates and chronicles the life of her brother.  She seems to be the only one who truly understood him and why he did what he did, regardless of the fact that she had to heal herself from the loss of her brother.Chris died at the age of 23, and yet I would submit that most people have not lived the happy life that he lived at twice his age.  He truly lived the life he wanted to have.One thing that I found most profound was even though he was helping many people whom he came across on his journey, Chris was always provided for whether it be a pair of boots, a beat up cowboy hat, or some old fishing gear and machete.  Is this not what all of the sacred writings talk about?This is an experience to be treasured, and this film should be required viewing for nearly everyone.  Because through Chris's journey, we might stop and reflect on our own journeys.  Are we living our lives to the fullest?  Are we happening to life or is life happening to us?  Are we happy?  Chris found his answers, and hopefully, we will all find ours since we are all on our own spiritual journey.",5,An Epic Spiritual Journey of the Human Spirit Through the Freedom of Simplicity,1207785600,"04 10, 2008",2008,4381,"['may', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'directed', 'masterpiece', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'powerful', 'true', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'Self', 'epic', 'journey.Chris', 'McCandless', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'graduated', 'college', 'nearly', '25,000', 'savings', 'family', 'hoping', 'will', 'use', 'Harvard', 'education', 'Instead', 'unthinkable', 'few', 'hundred', 'charity', 'off', 'trek', 'country', 'eventually', 'last', 'bit', 'money', 'left', 'Crazy', 'Perhaps', 'anyway', 'Life', 'OUTSIDE', 'comfort', 'zone', 'Conversations', 'God', 'quote', 'applies', 'Chris', 'chosen', 'not', 'play', 'life', 'safe', 'live', 'engage', 'new', 'experiences', 'often', 'taking', 'risks', 'start', 'journey', 'Chris', 'nearly', 'day.The', 'journey', 'Chris', 'Alexander', 'Supertramp', 'McCandless', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'journeys', 'man', 'journey', 'letting', 'go', 'return', 'state', 'simplicity', 'removing', 'virtually', 'worldly', 'possessions', 'attachments', 'basic', 'necessities', 'not', 'wish', 'be', 'bogged', 'down', 'conformity', 'hypocrisy', 'human', 'relationships', 'longer', 'so', 'family', 'everything', 'behind.The', 'irony', 'letting', 'go', 'tantamount', 'healing', 'Self', 'discovery', 'Chris', 'number', 'people', 'journey', 'seem', 'be', 'touched', 'simple', 'yet', 'wise', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'powerful', 'healing', 'energy', 'are', 'aware', 'most', 'touching', 'meeting', 'last', 'one', 'shown', 'Ron', 'Franz', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'especially', 'sweet', 'performance', 'old', 'man', 'living', 'Anza-Borrego', 'desert', 'Southern', 'California', 'Chris', 'Ron', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'life', 'new', 'experiences', 'just', 'old', 'not', 'give', 'illusion', 'human', 'relationships', 'are', 'principle', 'form', 'happiness', 'see', 'sparkle', 'realization', 'Ron', 'eyes', 'truth', 'sinks', 'Ron', 'so', 'taken', 'Chris', 'adopt', 'Chris', 'simply', 'can', 'talk', 'when', 'Alaska', 'point', 'Ron', 'Chris', 'belongs', 'one', 'even', 'Chris', 'indeed', 'Chris', 'truly', 'loving', 'relationship', 'letting', 'go', 'not', 'holding', 'evident', 'only', 'type', 'relationship', 'person', 'across.Chris', 'modern', 'day', 'Thoreau', 'ironically', 'read', 'lot', 'including', 'Tolstoy', 'London', 'other', 'writers', 'wilds', 'Alaska', 'live', 'deliberately', 'simply', 'order', 'gain', 'further', 'insight', 'wisdom', 'who', 'what', 'life', 'really', 'surprise', 'when', 'finally', 'away', 'smile', 'face', 'truly', 'lived.The', 'performance', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'fantastic', 'one', 'role', 'simply', 'much', 'how', 'real', 'Chris', 'McCandless', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'know', 'Chris', 'knowledge', 'role.Jena', 'Malone', 'Chris', 'sister', 'equally', 'important', 'life', 'brother', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'truly', 'understood', 'why', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'regardless', 'fact', 'had', 'heal', 'loss', 'brother.Chris', 'died', 'age', '23', 'yet', 'would', 'submit', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'not', 'lived', 'happy', 'life', 'lived', 'twice', 'age', 'truly', 'lived', 'life', 'wanted', 'have.One', 'thing', 'found', 'most', 'profound', 'was', 'even', 'was', 'helping', 'many', 'people', 'whom', 'came', 'journey', 'Chris', 'was', 'always', 'provided', 'be', 'pair', 'boots', 'beat', 'up', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'old', 'fishing', 'gear', 'machete', 'not', 'what', 'sacred', 'writings', 'talk', 'experience', 'be', 'treasured', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'Chris', 'journey', 'might', 'stop', 'reflect', 'own', 'journeys', 'Are', 'living', 'lives', 'fullest', 'Are', 'happening', 'life', 'life', 'happening', 'Are', 'happy', 'Chris', 'found', 'answers', 'hopefully', 'will', 'find', 'ours', 'are', 'own', 'spiritual', 'journey']",N/A

1123162,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B000ZN802W,Spider Monkey,"[3, 4]","'Into The Wild' is a very gentle, introspective film that had me engrossed the whole way through. Emile Hirsch's performance draws you immediately into his characters (Chris') pursuit of a free, unfettered life, in touch with nature and it's finer elements. You understand his idealism and his strong focus to achieve his aims. Sean Penn directed this film superbly. One part that stands out is when Chris goes into a big city and his feelings of disconnect and alienation. Penn manages to show these emotions (using various film and camera techniques) with real skill and you feel as awkward and out of place as Chris does. The soundtrack is awesome, with music by Eddie Vedder and it really adds to the overall feel of the film. You can really see the benefits of this type of lifestyle and a part of you yearns to follow the life Chris did and to experience life, relationships and nature on a fundamental, stripped back level. Having read the book I was aware of the general story and this film is remarkably faithful to it, there are very few deviations. In addition, I felt none of the frustrations with Chris' attitude that I felt when reading the book. Being portrayed on the screen and acted so well, I understood the mindset a little more. He is shown to be more naive in the book than in the film, but this made the film a better viewing experience, they are different media after all. This film offers some insightful ideas and philosophy, but you aren't spoon fed them or have them rammed down your throat, which is a refreshing change from a Hollywood film. With amazing locations, excellent acting, top direction and an inspired soundtrack this makes for one great film and one I highly recommend.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",5,Into the Wild,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,1781,"['Wild', 'very', 'gentle', 'introspective', 'film', 'had', 'engrossed', 'whole', 'way', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'performance', 'draws', 'immediately', 'characters', 'Chris', 'pursuit', 'free', 'unfettered', 'life', 'touch', 'nature', 'finer', 'elements', 'understand', 'idealism', 'strong', 'focus', 'achieve', 'aims', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'directed', 'film', 'superbly', 'One', 'part', 'out', 'when', 'Chris', 'big', 'city', 'feelings', 'disconnect', 'alienation', 'Penn', 'show', 'emotions', 'using', 'various', 'film', 'camera', 'techniques', 'real', 'skill', 'feel', 'awkward', 'place', 'Chris', 'soundtrack', 'awesome', 'music', 'Eddie', 'Vedder', 'really', 'overall', 'feel', 'film', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'benefits', 'type', 'lifestyle', 'part', 'yearns', 'follow', 'life', 'Chris', 'did', 'experience', 'life', 'relationships', 'nature', 'fundamental', 'stripped', 'back', 'level', 'Having', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'aware', 'general', 'story', 'film', 'remarkably', 'faithful', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'deviations', 'addition', 'felt', 'none', 'frustrations', 'Chris', 'attitude', 'felt', 'when', 'reading', 'book', 'Being', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'acted', 'so', 'well', 'understood', 'mindset', 'little', 'more', 'shown', 'be', 'more', 'naive', 'book', 'film', 'made', 'film', 'better', 'viewing', 'experience', 'are', 'different', 'media', 'film', 'insightful', 'ideas', 'philosophy', 'are', ""n't"", 'spoon', 'fed', 'have', 'rammed', 'throat', 'refreshing', 'change', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'amazing', 'locations', 'excellent', 'acting', 'top', 'direction', 'inspired', 'soundtrack', 'one', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'highly', 'recommend.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",N/A

1123164,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,B000ZN802W,Steffan Piper,"[18, 25]","Obviously spoilers below ...I have a difficult time writing this review because of concern with the star rating that I've chosen for it. I've broken this review down into seven different sections for obvious reasons, as each section is something that should be addressed when talking about either this film, this book, the people involved from the actors to the McCandless's to Sean Penn himself.The Book -There are probably more people that will initially come to this film because of the book than the other way around; but over time this film will be seen by more people that haven't read the book or possibly even be aware of a book. That's not a critique of the material, just a plain fact. More people watch films than read books these days.The story of Chris McCandless though, should start with the book and how Krakauer started a snowball with a simple article in `Outdoor' Magazine which A LOT of people who had met Chris (as Alex) had responded to with comments like: ""Hey, I met him trying to hitch a ride ..."" Jon Krakauer spent a lot of time putting the book together through accounts, phone calls, letters and meetings to find out how the information of Chris all come together; and more importantly how Chris had touched the lives and made such a stand-out impression on each of these very random people that he came across. In fact, Chris made such an impression on these people that some people read the article and wrote Krakauer stating: ""This guy sounds like a guy I met near the Salton Sea, etc.""  This is the real essence of how this story really came together and people should be aware of it. All of this transpired BEFORE the book. Someone had even heard the story of a dead hiker found in Alaska on Paul Harvey and Westerberg thought it might be him so he called the Alaskan authorities. Strangely, the Paul Harvey piece was how I had first heard of McCandless as well. So, knowing what you know now, maybe having read the book and seen the film, one must give proper credence to the impact of Chris McCandless in the lives of the people he met. I'll come back to this point later.The Screenplay & Film -Having watched hundreds of films through the years and then going back and listening to the Director's Commentary whenever possible, I've learned a great many things. Foremost, which is relevant to this story, is how Robert Zemeckis worked with several writer's over the course of a handful of years sharpening theForrest Gumpadapted script. Anyone who had seen the film and read the book, knows the point that's coming. Sometimes the spirit of the material is more important than the bulk of the material. In the case of Forrest Gump, I believe Zemeckis stated that the screenplay went through three different writers and multiple revisions until the last person, Eric Roth had figured out what Forrest Gump was really about. Christopher McCandless's story was surely about the spirit of the material; and definitely not about the bulk, which is how it comes across on the screen as delivered -- and very choppy at that.Sean Penn adapted this directly from the book, decided which parts to focus on and what to leave out. The real problem seems to stem from Penn not wanting to get into the middle of the McCandless / Supertramp dynamic which was painfully obvious in the book, but Penn tries to maintain the high ground of being impartial which doesn't really serve the story. Sean Penn probably would've been better served leaning one way or the other regarding McCandless and showing us ""why"" through the film, rather than leaving it ambiguous. The whole point of being there, was to be transported to a point of view.Christopher McCandless was not a middle-of-the-road / dry-journalism kind of guy. I will say that this long drawn out, meandering approach worked well for Penn withThe Indian Runner, an older film of his which is one of my top ten films of all time. In Indian Runner, Penn let the viewer decide and observe the true nature of Frank Roberts, wickedly played by Viggo Mortenson. Viggo emoted so thickly, so heavily and breathed such life into the character that you couldn't help but be compelled - no matter how long the movie was. When it ended you were looking everywhere for more footage, maybe a book, a Bruce Springsteen album, footnotes, anything that would give you more about what you had just seen. But with Chris, Penn should've made a decision about which was a greater loss - Supertramp or McCandless, simply because Frank was a fictional character, while Chris was not.Ignoring the psychological breakdown and split of the character should've been the touchstone of this movie, but it wasn't. The split, Alexander Supertramp, was treated as just a shallow creation or a childish whim by a foolish youth - instead of the self-absorbed superman from Nietzsche's `""Thus Spake Zarathustra""' that Chris had imagined himself to be which seemed to take root while he was at Emory. Most of the readers of the Krakauer book seemed to have bonded with the idealistic Supertramp, rather than the foolish McCandles that the readers of Outdoor Magazine unanimously gave a thumbs down to for the fear of being a reckless role-model to other readers and enthusiasts.This film does not tell the story from the perspective of Alex Supertramp, although it tries to shed light to it. It also does not tell the story of Chris McCandless, although it tries to convince us of this, by wrapping itself in the facts that were collected by Jon Krakauer and passing itself as a film version with the same title.However, some of the book's complicated undertone of sadness, confusion, and idealism are lightly palpable in the film. Chris McCandless was a romantic; Krakauer's book appreciates that, as well as Chris's youthful idealism and smugness. But unfortunately, the film seems to miss most of this.A real, and massive breakdown in this film was the use of narration. While I am a huge advocate of V.O. Narration, a case exists here for the absence of one. Having Jena Malone, of Donnie Darko fame, and a mediocre talent, speaking her inner thoughts over scenic footage does this film a serious disservice, comes across as inconsistent and tacked on for effect. There were many other ways to tell this story better, but sometimes good books do not always translate into good movies.The Music -Eddie Vedder, like Sean Penn, is difficult as a personality to separate from his art due to certain  things that have transpired in the last decade. Anytime I hear Pearl Jam these days, all I can hear is a talented musician who wasted himself indulging in his own flaws - strangely much like McCandless, except Vedder did this with his career and not his life. Vedder thought that it was appropriate to repeat and stick with the now-dead North-West sound which is the last bastion of Seattle Grunge. Granted, this soundtrack is probably the biggest departure for him in a long time, but looking at the contribution of his work for this film, one is left wondering - why Vedder? The music sounds uninspired and dull, where nothing really stands out thematically and there actually seems to be a void where a musical theme should be. Penn should've befriended Gabriel Yared as the first choice to do the score. But I find this just one more bad choice in a long line of bad choices made by Penn for the production of this movie. Going back to Indian Runner, which has a great score and a well-placed soundtrack, it seems as if the magic just couldn't be duplicated for what would've been a great film and probably an equally great soundtrack and score.I do want to state that I don't agree with the Awards Academy that the music comes off as ""too song based"", whatever that means. I think that's one of the most ridiculous statements ever to come out of whatever administration Hollywood has. I also believe that, even though I didn't like it, Vedder should at least been nominated for his efforts for an Oscar.The Actors -I'm holding the minority report on this one, but I really don't believe that Emile Hirsch was all that good in this film. Yes, he has a basic resemblance to McCandless as any young, mousy haired twenty-something actor would. McCandless was a magnetic personality that people were struck into awe by when they met, even once. Emile Hirsch has none of those qualities, if he does, they certainly weren't evinced in this movie. I feel he came off bland and gave a very weak performance of McCandless, which actually bordered on shameful and pedestrian. It was if someone had asked him to play Jesus Christ and he decided that maybe a hollow representation of Truman Capote was more appropriate. Emile Hirsch's acting in this is the real Achilles heal here and couldn't have been further off the mark. There could've been so many other actors who would've handled this role with more realism, energy and vivaciousness. Emile Hirsch's rendition of McCandless is pretty sad to say the least, he was filler for those just wanting to navel-gaze.The casting director and Penn set up a would-be Oscar dream-tream with the supporting cast. Hal Holbrook gives his ""John Wayne"" performance here and does so magnificently and very memorably. Catherine Keener is dynamic, William Hurt (my favorite actor in this)  is magnetic, delivering a strong and convincing portrayal of the person you encounter when you read the book and Vince Vaughn is a nice choice for Wayne Westerburg. So what could go so insidiously wrong here?The Critics -A lot has been said regarding what was left in and what was left out, differing between the book and the movie. It should be stated that McCandless had a basic road map of the area, some money, his identification cards and some have speculated -- a broken or injured arm. Some cite the picture of Chris in front of the bus  as evidence-light. Looking closely at his right arm, it appears not to in the sleeve but under his shirt wrapped in a sling. In a later photograph though, he's seen with both arms visible and free from sling or obvious injury.I have posted both photos above for those interested to see.Chris M. / Alex S. -What would Christopher J. McCandless say about all this? How would he have felt about a feature film immortalizing and lionizing his deeds for better or worse?McCandless did want to become a writer, this much is known from the friends he met and made. Had he lived, he would've wanted to chronicle his adventures, and maybe becoming famous for it. If he did, it would've been an after effect and if a film was made of his works -- spoils of war, so to speak. But this is all hyperbole and supposition now. The truth is no one would want the worst decisions of their early twenties to be the defining moments of their lives and then be broadcast across the globe for all to see without any say.Alex Supertramp would've loathed the telling, the filming and the mass marketing of this effort. Alex would've wondered where the spirit and the fire and the message was had he sat in a theatre and watched this play out. Perhaps this was the problem McCandless's parents had when they saw this during the screening, maybe they ""felt the lack of it"", to quote Penn fromanother movie. Having been author to anti-establishment writing, I may be a little biased in my viewpoint. I only state this as some readers of this review might click on my other reviews or see my writings and then feel that I was being inconsistent. While I can understand McCandless and see the world of which he spoke of, as an ex-Marine and a long-distance hiker of the Appalachian trail, of his methods and planning - I cannot abide. So, like many other readers and viewers, I too have a split opinion of McCandless.Sean Penn -Like I stated about Vedder, it's hard sometimes for consumers of art to sometimes remove their view of the artist from the art and therefore see it unobstructed. Sean Penn has done and said many things in the last numerous years to anger enough people, and isolate himself with his point of view. Maybe making a film about a man who railed inwardly in anger over consumerism, urban blight and gross waste and personal attachment was more powerful and greater than anything he could've said or done by himself. So, at least in the spirit of the thing, he does deserve that much credit - if that was the case. Otherwise, many viewers might see this movie and only witness the smugness of Chris McCandless and the smugness of Sean Penn, and thus walk away disappointed and regretful of the time spent. That, at least, does sum up much of the bad reviews so far about this film.Living on the West Coast, in Los Angeles, I've actually crossed paths with Penn a few times so far in life. The last time was in San Francisco, when I was spending a long day at the bar drinking at Tosca's in North beach. It's the kind of place that most people, tourists included don't go, because they just don't understand the allure; which is absolutely fine by me. My exchange with him was brief and cordial. If I would've seen this movie first, I would've probably had a lot more to say to him.I wanted to give this more stars because I do appreciate Sean Penn's contribution to film, his acting and his temperament. I also wanted to give it more stars for Chris McCandless, but ... it's more a review of the film than it is of any one person.",3,To call a thing by its true name ...,1205884800,"03 19,

1123177,AEKVNXC6R8O9G,B000ZN802W,The philosopher,"[6, 9]","Into the Wild will not be to everyone's liking.  Some people will dislike the protagonist, Christopher McCandless, and others will find the movie's pacing to be slow.  Yet, I was fascinated by and even a little envious of Chris's dogged attempt to find meaning in life and his disregard for other people's expectations.  Like the ascetic monks who would wander into the desert to find enlightenment, Chris was determined to find the answers to spiritual questions by renouncing all worldly things and, ultimately, all contact with other people.Jaded by the shallowness of America's consumer culture and the poisonous dynamics of family life as he grew up, and inspired by writers like Tolstoy, Thoreau, and London who praised simplicity and being connected to nature, Chris decides after graduating from Emory University to give away his money, break off all contact with his wealthy family, and take off on the mother of all road trips.  He does not get far before his car is damaged in flash flooding, so he abandons the automobile and makes the remainder of his journey by walking, canoeing, hitchhiking, or sneaking onto freight trains.  Chris travels to various places in America and Mexico and plunges into new experiences, new friendships, and a new romance.  Drawing him onward is the lure of his ""great Alaska adventure"" in which he would live alone in Alaska's big sky country.  Along his circuitous route to Alaska, he breaks the hearts of many people he leaves behind, including a lonely old man, Ron Franz (played by Hal Holbrook, in a touching performance), who offers to adopt him.  Although Chris shows his fondness for Ron, Chris keeps him at a safe emotional distance by saying that happiness cannot be found in human relationships.[SPOILER ALERT]  After Chris at last makes his way into the Alaskan backcountry in April, he makes a series of mistakes (not properly preserving his wild game and eating poisonous berries) that bring him to the brink of death.  At last experiencing the most profound type of solitude--that of an isolated person confronting his imminent end--Chris concludes that a happy life is one shared with others, not one spent alone.  The viewer is left to ponder the question of whether, if Chris had recovered, he truly would have reintegrated into society or whether the ""call of the wild"" would have led him back onto his solitary path.  In other words, even if Chris did not want to die alone, it's unclear whether he would have wanted to live alone.Raising perennial questions about whether society improves or spoils its members, whether happiness is found in social settings or in confronting nature alone, whether a person should live by uncompromising ideals or should make his peace with society's numerous and serious flaws, whether someone who so completely rejects society's shared ideals is a genius or a madman, and whether Chris was running away from his problems or engaging in a necessarily private spiritual quest, Into the Wild gives the thoughtful viewer much to think about.  Yet, the movie also engages the viewers' emotions by showing Chris's desperate yearning for a pure and intensely lived life and the fragile and combustible dynamics of human relationships.

1123178,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000ZN802W,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 10]","I didn't love ""Into the Wild"", Sean Penn's new film based on the bestseller by Jon Krakauer.Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) graduates from Emory College, barely able to tolerate his parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) attendance at lunch after the graduation. Eating with his parents and his sister (Jena Malone), he rebuffs their offer of a new car. What does he need a new car for? What does he need material possessions for? Chris embarks on a road trip, using the car to get as far West as possible. When it finally breaks down, he cuts up all of his ID, his credit card, and his driver's license and burns his cash and sets out on foot. His goal is to make it to Alaska and camp and commune with nature. He doesn't tell his parents where he is going, because they would surely send out people to track him down, so he gets a good months head start before they even realize he is gone. Along the way, he meets a couple of hippies (Catherine Keener an d newcomer Brian Dierker), a boss who becomes a friend (Vince Vaughn) and an elderly man who is extremely lonely (Hal Holbrook). Each of these people will help him with wisdom and insight along the way to his ultimate destination. Alaska. There, he finds an abandoned bus and sets up camp within the shelter.""Into the Wild"" is an interesting story, and will hold your interest, but the directing style is extremely obtrusive and the lead character is a little too selfish to be likable.Based on a true story, there is apparently some debate about whether Chris' journey is an act of selfishness or self-discovery. I can see both sides of this argument. But I have to lean towards selfish. It is understandable, and identifiable, that he wants to get away from his parents. I think all people have had these feelings at least once in their life. And from our brief moments with his parents and some things we learn later, these feelings are understandable. But when Chris leaves, and doesn't communicate with his family, he also doesn't communicate with his sister. Throughout the film, we hear the sister provide voice over explaining what a close bond she and Chris share, how they coped with their parents, etc. Why wouldn't he call his sister at some point? The film is about his journey to Alaska, but he doesn't spend the entire film in Alaska. He is often near or has access to a phone. If he has such a close bond with his sister, it doesn't make sense that he would never call her, never send her a letter, never try to contact her and let her know he is all right.Penn has apparently wanted to make this film for a number of years. He only held off because he was waiting for the approval of the McCandless family. He finally got their approval and then made the film. The story is ripe with dramatic potential. A young man makes a journey of self-discovery, trying to fulfill his dream of living in the wilderness. But this dramatic potential is robbed, in many cases, because Penn uses a number of editing techniques and storytelling devices, which do nothing more than reinforce the feeling we are watching a film. Every time the actors start to approach anything near what the film should be, Penn splits the screen into a number of pictures, all showing Emile Hirsch as McCandless, and we immediately snap back to reality and realize ""Hey, we're watching a film."" Split screens (think TV's ""24""), slow motion photography and other camera tricks all serve to draw the viewer out of what should be a small, intimate portrait of a young man`s journey.I read an article about Eddie Vedder's contributions to the film. Penn asked him to write some music and liked it so much, he asked him to write more, and they put a number of songs in the film. These moments are meant to be more background music, to give a little texture to this film portrait of McCandless' life but they also detract from the young man's journey. Most of the songs are simply Vedder humming, or making a tune with his deep voice. Very few actually have words. So it just seems a little odd to hear these strange sounds, as we watch the journey of a young man traveling through the wilderness.Emile Hirsch does a very good job. ""Wild"" is about his character's journey, and he is on screen for the majority of the film, so it is essential that we feel what he feels. If we don't feel the joy, the peace, the danger and the fright he feels, we have nothing to identify with. In a film of this nature, there are no other characters in a majority of the film, so if we don't identify with Chris, we have nothing to help us enter the story, no one to take us on the journey.I liked Hirsch's performance. Hirsch is turning into a very strong actor. He and Justin Timberlake were the standouts in the underrated ""Alpha Dog"" and has appeared in a number of other little seen films and had roles in television shows. In ""Into the Wild"" Hirsch brings a maturity to the role hinting at some of the performances he will deliver, some of the roles in his future.There are three pit stops in his journey. He first meets Jan (Catherine Keener) and her partner Rainey (Brian Dierker), two hippies who live in a camper and like to set up stakes with a community of like minded individuals in the desert. They earn a few dollars here and there, mosey along the road, and meet new people. In their discussions, they talk about Jan's son, whom she hasn't seen for a long time. This is a nice compliment to Chris' journey. Jan's comments have to make Chris think about the effect he is having on his own parents. Keener, as always, does a great job with her relatively small role. Brian Dierker is also very good. He realizes the emotional troubles his partner has, and seems to love her all the more for them.Then Chris meets Wayne (Vince Vaughn). Wayne is a bit of a wild guy, and he has a business of his own, so he hires Chris. They get along and work well together and form a friendship. Throughout the film, we see a letter or two Chris writes to Wayne, the letters writing out on the screen in bright big letters (remember the comment about Penn's directing style earlier? Yet another example.) When we eventually meet Wayne and see the bond they form, these letters make sense.At the bar one night, as Chris is relating his reasons for making this journey, Wayne realizes Chris has a fire in his spirit, much like he does. But he also realizes Chris has to tame this fire, or it could lead to bad things. He provides some useful advice.Finally, Chris meets Ron (Hal Holbrook). Ron is an elderly man, who lives alone and offers to let Chris stay with him for a while. Ron and Chris form a friendship as well and when Chris is finally ready to move on, there is a touching moment when Chris and Ron have to say goodbye to one another.These three pit stops are meant to illustrate a different aspect of Chris' life or behavior. Yet, he doesn't seem to learn from them. Because he doesn't learn anything from them, what is the point of sitting through them?As Chris begins his journey, he decides to change his name to Alex Supertramp. Not sure why. When I initially saw this information in the trailer and put this together with the car he owns, I suspected the film was set in the late `60s or early `70s. Why would a kid in the `80s and `90s come up with an idea like this? Not sure, because we never really see or hear any reasoning behind this. He must just be one of those people who would probably be more comfortable in a different era.""Into the Wild"" is interesting, and contains some interesting, moving performances, but it doesn't do a good job of portraying the journey of the main character. As Chris is the singular force in the film, the story should be intimate. When letters are written across the screen and the image becomes a split screen, this takes us out of the story and makes the story seem more superficial.",3,Penn's Directing Style Mars An Otherwise

1123181,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B000ZN802W,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[78, 96]","Just about the time Sean Penn was reading the book ""Into the Wild,"" so was I. The book reminded me, first, of a good friend whom I've known since the mid-1960s. He's always fancied himself as somewhat of a wild man. He barely made it through high school, lived a kind of offbeat lifestyle for a long time--even turned me onto some music I might not otherwise have heard. He always wanted to relocate to Alaska. Thus far,  he hasn't made it.Then, after seeing the movie, I spent a few days with a group of students and their teachers from Alaska. They were delightful people, yet when I brought up Chris McCandless, they referred to him as, essentially, nuts. That didn't surprise me much. Indeed, it's an irony: We live in a country that proclaims individualism, yet when one pursues his own path--look at even the well-known like Thoreau--they're condemned for it. ""Conventional thinking"" is that one is to pursue a lifestyle of comfort and consumption. That's why we go to school, right?Anyway, when I finished the book, I envied first the author. He's one of the best writers of today. But I also envied McCandless. What? Envying a dead man? Well, we're all going to die some day. Some will do it without having lived--to paraphrase Thoreau. Chris lived before he died. Maybe a little naively, but he lived. That's truly enviable.It was so long ago that I read the book that I need to read it again, or listen to the recorded version. Frankly, I recall that the author did a little speculation in the book. How much, for example, did Chris's parents' relationship have to do with his behavior? I repeat, the author speculated. In the film, Penn had Chris's sister self-reflecting a lot, and that's where the speculation took place. (And Chris's relationship with his sister in the film seemed a little peculiar. But I'll let you watch and see if you agree or not.) And in the film, it came across as assertion rather than speculation. That's the only weakness of the film.The film, other than that, was quite accurate to the book. McCandless took off on his own, essentially cut all ties to his ""past,"" including getting rid of a lot of money that could have made his pursuit less valid. Emile Hirsch looks uncannily like McCandless. And the over 100 lbs. that he lost for the role--incredible!I thought the rest of the casting of the film was superb. Some of the roles were chanced into, but that made the film all the more realistic. And I thought William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden were spectacular as Chris's parents, their own self doubts and passions exposed in both expressions and behavior.What motivated McCandless? We can only speculate. Did he make some mistakes? Yes, as would any of us.Might we learn something from him? Most definitely! Like in the book, Chris's notes were an integral part of the film's script. I'm so tempted to list them here, but that would give away an important element of the film.The additional disk in this version of the DVD also gives you a little to think about, on the characters, the production. And it's not a self-aggrandizing extravanza as many of the ""bonus materials"" are.Anyway, my thanks to Sean Penn for making a fine film out of one of the better books I've ever read, about a ""great American."" No, Chris McCandless didn't write declarations. He didn't write bestsellers. He didn't make long speeches about himself. But he pursued something he was compelled to do. I wish more of us had the guts to do so.Rest in peace, Chris.",4,A fine adaptation--with weaknesses--of a superb book,1210291200,"05 9, 2008",2008,3483,"['Just', 'time', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'was', 'reading', 'book', 'Wild', 'was', 'book', 'reminded', 'first', 'good', 'friend', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'known', 'mid-1960s', 'always', 'fancied', 'somewhat', 'wild', 'man', 'barely', 'made', 'high', 'school', 'lived', 'kind', 'offbeat', 'lifestyle', 'long', 'time', 'even', 'turned', 'music', 'might', 'not', 'otherwise', 'have', 'heard', 'always', 'wanted', 'relocate', 'Alaska', 'Thus', 'far', ""n't"", 'made', 'it.Then', 'seeing', 'movie', 'spent', 'few', 'days', 'group', 'students', 'teachers', 'Alaska', 'were', 'delightful', 'people', 'yet', 'when', 'brought', 'up', 'Chris', 'McCandless', 'referred', 'essentially', 'nuts', 'did', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'much', 'Indeed', 'irony', 'live', 'country', 'individualism', 'yet', 'when', 'one', 'own', 'path', 'look', 'even', 'well-known', 'Thoreau', ""'re"", 'condemned', 'Conventional', 'thinking', 'one', 'pursue', 'lifestyle', 'comfort', 'consumption', 'why', 'go', 'school', 'right', 'Anyway', 'when', 'finished', 'book', 'envied', 'first', 'author', 'one', 'best', 'writers', 'today', 'also', 'envied', 'McCandless', 'What', 'Envying', 'dead', 'man', 'Well', ""'re"", 'going', 'die', 'day', 'will', 'do', 'having', 'lived', 'paraphrase', 'Thoreau', 'Chris', 'lived', 'died', 'Maybe', 'little', 'naively', 'lived', 'truly', 'enviable.It', 'was', 'so', 'long', 'read', 'book', 'need', 'read', 'again', 'listen', 'recorded', 'version', 'Frankly', 'recall', 'author', 'did', 'little', 'speculation', 'book', 'How', 'much', 'example', 'did', 'Chris', 'parents', 'relationship', 'have', 'do', 'behavior', 'repeat', 'author', 'speculated', 'film', 'Penn', 'had', 'Chris', 'sister', 'self-reflecting', 'lot', 'where', 'speculation', 'took', 'place', 'Chris', 'relationship', 'sister', 'film', 'seemed', 'little', 'peculiar', ""'ll"", 'let', 'watch', 'see', 'agree', 'not', 'film', 'came', 'assertion', 'rather', 'speculation', 'only', 'weakness', 'film.The', 'film', 'other', 'was', 'quite', 'accurate', 'book', 'McCandless', 'took', 'off', 'own', 'essentially', 'cut', 'ties', 'past', 'including', 'getting', 'rid', 'lot', 'money', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'pursuit', 'less', 'valid', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'uncannily', 'like', 'McCandless', 'over', '100', 'lbs', 'lost', 'role', 'incredible', 'thought', 'rest', 'casting', 'film', 'was', 'superb', 'roles', 'were', 'chanced', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'realistic', 'thought', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'were', 'spectacular', 'Chris', 'parents', 'own', 'self', 'doubts', 'passions', 'exposed', 'expressions', 'behavior.What', 'motivated', 'McCandless', 'can', 'only', 'speculate', 'Did', 'make', 'mistakes', 'Yes', 'would', 'us.Might', 'learn', 'something', 'Most', 'definitely', 'book', 'Chris', 'notes', 'were', 'integral', 'part', 'film', 'script', ""'m"", 'so', 'tempted', 'list', 'here', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'important', 'element', 'film.The', 'additional', 'disk', 'version', 'DVD', 'also', 'little', 'think', 'characters', 'production', 'not', 'self-aggrandizing', 'extravanza', 'many', 'bonus', 'materials', 'are.Anyway', 'thanks', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'making', 'fine', 'film', 'one', 'better', 'books', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'read', 'great', 'American', 'No', 'Chris', 'McCandless', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'declarations', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'bestsellers', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'long', 'speeches', 'pursued', 'something', 'was', 'compelled', 'do', 'wish', 'more', 'had', 'guts', 'do', 'so.Rest', 'peace', 'Chris']",N/A

The film follows his journey, from college graduation and is an amazing story. Emile Hirsch gives an unbelievable performance as McCandless but was snubbed by the Academy.

there that called for him; something outside society and its bounds, deadlines, stress and the quest for buying more plastic made commodities and shiny gadgets.immersed in his world of music and books where he would find solace, he was a highly sensitive boy with a high intelligence.reading a lot of litterature without keeping your feet in the real world, creates a universe of idealism in which, the frustrated mind finds refuge. it's like a drug. the more you hide in that ideal world, the more frustrated and bitter you become when faced with the actual world we all live in: seeing his parents consent to live together despite their enormous differences, chris saw them as hypocrites, especially his mom, who, despite being betrayed by her husband, chooses to stay because of the comfort and security she got used to. after all, the husband is a NASA genius and we dont leave such a man because he slept with another woman.unmaterialistic to the farthest extent, chris was still planning to enter college but his parents deciding to reward him with a brand new car, was the last straw for the kid: he finds out that after all that time, his parents still didnt understand his personality and that he was never attracted by aquiring 'things' and that rewarding him with 'things' showed him how much his bickering parents cling to appearences.what happens next is chris, submerged in a tide of idealism leavs all behind, on a trek bound for alaska, as far as possible from social bonds, hypocrisy and materialism.he works in odd jobs, uses money as much as needed for his sustenance, and on his way, leaves a positive mark on the people he meets; a spirit who wills not to be ensnared by the ephemereal and tricky temptations of the modern world.while discovering the savage beauty of the nature around him, our hero will ultimately discover that happiness only has meaning when it's shared.. and since the whole world has become neck deep into  dependance on modernity, his odds to meet a likeminded soul were equal to finding a winning lottery ticket on the ground. this meant he had to reintegrate society. his stubbornness to stay alone will lead him to his own demise: with little experience in the ways of survival, chris will be found dead by poisoning from inedible berries he ate by mistake.some people will be glad this kid who caused his family much suffering, met his just end, but the story is not about that;it's true that the character is too idealistic and ridden with flaws. he didnt seem to make efforts to help his parents have a better relationship, for example. he was too arrogant in the way that whenever he saw a glimpse of conformity and hypocrisy, he steered away without trying to do anything about it despite his obviously high intellignece and insight. he helped a foreign hippie couple overcome its differences while he could have done the same for his parents, but didnt.for all the flaws in chris' character, i dont see him as an example to follow, hence the rating of 3 over 5.the movie's strong point is reminding us that while we spend our life compromising, stressing out and tense about mortgages, due dates, deadlines and conformity, there's a beautiful world around us that we're failing to see. there's a peace we're missing, and a sense of eternity that's lost to us in our world ruled by intertwined timelines and purchase coupons.finally, eddie vedder and friends do a wonderful job with the soundtrack. the movie sports some truly amazing music.overall, this movie gently wakes us up to look around us and to notice the spirit , without alienating its audience with dumbed down philosophy and haughty lecturing. this is just a frustrated youth with some valid points that are worth exploring.",3,into the wild... 3.5

It is a true story which makes it all the more powerful.Having successfully completed his grueling four year degree, Chris McCandless is at a pivotal point in his life. His wealthy parents want to buy him a new car and pay for Harvard Law tuition--many kids dream--but Chris has other plans. Not even saying goodbye he sets off on a soul searching journey into the wild. What follows is his journey intercut with flashbacks and voiceovers from him as well as his sister. There are so many poignant scenes of such raw, real emotion that you can almost feel them.In other hands this could have been a dreary nature film, but Sean Penn handles the material masterfully as he blends the nature voyage with flash-backs, and haunting voice-overs. Emile Hirsch gives an astonishing performance as Chris, balancing a fine line between maturity and a child-like innocence to everything new to him. Everyone in the supporting cast does a wonderful job, including Marcia Gay Harden, William Hurt, Catherine Keener, Jena Malone, Kristen Stewart, Vince Vaughn, and Hal Holbrook. The combination of Sean Penn's adapted script, faultless direction, and Emile Hirsch's astonishing performance, is an Oscar-deserving collaboration.I cannot remember the last time I was so affected by a film. It has the type of power that seems emanate from the screen. It took me away from the day, theater, life completely until you are completely wrapped in the story hanging on everything that happens without a care for what else is going on, forgetting any worries or thoughts. I almost feel inadequate to write a review because this was such an astounding film that I am worried any selection of words will not give it the praise it deserves. It is so mesmerizingly, hypnotically, haunting, moving and affecting beyond words, all I can do is beg you to go out and witness it for yourself.",5,"A powerful, hypnotic, awe-inspiring masterpiece",1202256000,"02 6, 2008",2008,2148,"['plunging', 'deep', 'pool', 'water', 'Into', 'Wild', 'slowly', 'state', 'mesmerizing', 'euphoric', 'awe', 'subtle', 'power', 'surface', 'gasping', 'Wild', 'stunning', 'masterpiece', 'adapted', 'directed', 'Oscar-winning', 'actor', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'true', 'story', 'more', 'powerful.Having', 'successfully', 'completed', 'grueling', 'four', 'year', 'degree', 'Chris', 'McCandless', 'pivotal', 'point', 'life', 'wealthy', 'parents', 'want', 'buy', 'new', 'car', 'pay', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'tuition', 'many', 'kids', 'dream', 'Chris', 'other', 'plans', 'Not', 'even', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'off', 'soul', 'searching', 'journey', 'wild', 'What', 'journey', 'intercut', 'flashbacks', 'voiceovers', 'as', 'well', 'sister', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'such', 'raw', 'real', 'emotion', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'other', 'hands', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dreary', 'nature', 'film', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'material', 'masterfully', 'nature', 'voyage', 'flash-backs', 'haunting', 'voice-overs', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'Chris', 'balancing', 'fine', 'line', 'maturity', 'child-like', 'innocence', 'everything', 'new', 'Everyone', 'supporting', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'job', 'including', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'combination', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'adapted', 'script', 'faultless', 'direction', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'Oscar-deserving', 'collaboration.I', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'affected', 'film', 'type', 'power', 'emanate', 'screen', 'took', 'away', 'day', 'theater', 'life', 'completely', 'are', 'completely', 'wrapped', 'story', 'hanging', 'everything', 'care', 'what', 'else', 'going', 'forgetting', 'worries', 'thoughts', 'almost', 'feel', 'inadequate', 'write', 'review', 'was', 'such', 'astounding', 'film', 'am', 'worried', 'selection', 'words', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'praise', 'so', 'mesmerizingly', 'hypnotically', 'haunting', 'moving', 'affecting', 'words', 'can', 'do', 'beg', 'go', 'out', 'witness']",N/A

A Stunning Work of Art! This is what I love about film. Every once in a while you stumble upon a work of art that renews your faith in filmmakers with poetry in their hearts. This is one of those films.A life influenced by Thoreau and Jack London. A non-fiction tale that could have been penned by Maugham or Kerouac about a young man with an Eagle Spirit. His Bohemian quest for wisdom, freedom, and oneness with the creator. And the few souls that were touched by his native heart along the way. Chyroned by journal entries and poetic musings. A search for truth, shamanic recapitulation, and liberation of the psyche. A beautiful soul's delinquent realization of love at the final hour. A warrior facing his own death. It's tragic and mortally liberating consequences.Wide open vistas and panoramic splendor grace the frames of this oil painting, like Adam's first journey thru The Garden. Eric Gautier's incredible cinematography, Sean Penn's masterful direction, and Emile Hirsch's stunning portrayal achieve a beautiful, glorious, poetic, uplifting, and tragic celebration of the heart.Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder adds a solemn air to the proceedings.Self-destruction is a very different act than annihilation of the self. Or the ego. Which is what Chris was all about. He lived more life in 22 years, than most of us live in a lifetime.Thank You Sean,I have a best friend that is with me now, only in spirit. He too, was a Free Spirit. He loved to climb mountains. The taller the better. At the end of his life, he was climbing mountains with an oxygen tank. He died of Cystic Fibrosis in the mid 90's. I wish I had gone hiking with him more often. Now he's gone. A clairvoyant I knew, once called him an Eagle Spirit. Thank You, for also making this film about my friend David Foster. I loved him. He would have loved this film. He was one of the oldest living CF patients in the U.S. He was in his mid-thirties and survived a lung transplant before he passed. Your film touched me in ways you can't possibly imagine. David was a warrior, just like Chris. And I witnessed the same withering of his temple. Thank You, again!I'm sure Chris is painting a beautiful landscape, somewhere in time, as a Warrior God. He is smiling down on his creation as he floats on Eagle Cloud. I just know, David is with him.Bravo, man! I stand in awe! You captured the shamanic recapitulation of Christopher's soul with remarkable clarity and insight. Beautiful work. You have the soul of a warrior poet. Bless. Thank You, for this amazing Work of Art.Life affiming. Yes, Love is the only path with heart.ONE OF THE GREATEST POEMS I'VE EVER SEEN ON FILM.

1123195,A3T689SS856U3N,B000ZN802W,Vincent Lassauw,"[1, 2]","Sean Penn as a director is at least as interesting as is his work from acting and this movie proves it once again. It is the true story of Chris McCandless, wonderfully portrayed by Emile Hirsch, who, graduating at 22, seems to have a very promising future ahead of him being admitted into Harvard Law, but instead chooses not to fulfill his parent's dreams for him but pursue his own. In doing so he wanders through the US after leaving behind his worldly goods, including giving away 20000 dollars of savings to charity.He breaks off all contact with his family and in the voiceover of his sister we gradually are handed pieces of the puzzle that lead him to do so. After more or less 2 years the trip ends in Alaska, after we've enjoyed a number of his interesting encounters with other people and many beautiful landscapes that made me want to pack my bags right there and then for another one of my cross country hikes.The development of the rather naive Chris is both fascinating as well as moving and Penn treats his journey as a classic novel, even up to dividing his movie into chapters with titles like ""birth"" or ""adolescence"", for those who weren't quite clever enough to pick up on it.What annoyed me the most about the movie was the music, which tries too hard to convey a certain atmosphere which distracts more than makes you focus. Penn seems to forget at times that old lesson that less is more and that the story is so powerful, it doesn't need this artificial boost of sentiment, but I guess being American, he just couldn't help himself, it is a national affliction after all.However it's one of very few issues I had with the movie that signifies a marvelous contribution with full adherence to the rules and laws of a traditional road movie.It's obvious that Penn has a lot of respect for this intelligent young man whose mind lives in his treasured books of writers like Tolstoy and Thoreau from whom he receives his life's lessons that serve to fuel his dreams of a pure and uncompromising life far away from anything materialistic and the corrupting influence of society. Unfortunately our hero is not able to see that all his philosophizing and travelling is just a self-deception to avoid dealing with the legacy of the dysfunctional past with his relatives and rather embrace a romantic philosophy of life in general and himself in particular. It is tragic that he eventually paid such a high price for this delusion.Until quite far into the movie Sean Penn doesn't take any critical distance from his subject but rather chooses to immerse his movie in romantic notions and atmospheric photography and rather trite repetition  of the same adolescent ramblings.As a viewer however this doesn't bother you at all and on first viewing you're eager to embrace the dramatic events and dreams of youth, passion and hope that we all want to catch again, even though at a certain point we learn that, though not an illusion, at least for those that have not yet sought refuge in misanthropy (a flight just as effective and opposite to the one Chris McCandless took), there is a more noble, though less attractive on the outside, heroism in defying the mud of day to day life in the midst of it rather than seeking oblivion in the remote wilderness. It's a little too easy and a bit like giving up of whom we are in our most fundamental level of being: a social animal.

1123200,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B000ZN802W,Wesley Mullins,"[1, 4]","*SPOILER WARNING* If you know nothing of this story, nearly all reviews give away the ""ending"".  Therefore, if you don't want to know anything about the plot of the film, don't read any reviews...including this one.The book's cover tells the story; a young idealist from a well-to-do family gives away his money and possessions before trudging into the Alaskan wild on a quest for spiritual awakening.  Four months later, his body is discovered by moose hunters.  Christopher McCandless' story can be reduced to those few words, so why do readers of Jon Krakauer's book about McCandless trek twenty miles into the unforgiving wilderness to visit his final resting place?  Why has he become the center of a cult-like mythology and the inspiration for Sean Penn's graceful biopic?Like Krakaeur, readers of ""Into the Wild"" and other people who have heard of McCandless' story on television, in newspapers or around a crackling fire surrounded by wanderers, Penn became bewitched by the young man so certain of the redemptive power of natural purity, self reliance and isolation that he cast off his worldly possessions after an impressive academic career at Emory University and tramped throughout the Western US.  Unlike judgmental critics who can't understand the longing within McCandless to explore a life of innocence untouched by the trappings of society, Penn felt the same desires within and set out to capture the story on screen.  Even those who dislike Penn (count me among you) should see within him many of the same idealistic, uncompromising traits of McCandless and the same subtle disappointment at the world for not sharing his aesthetics.Penn's film is a remarkably consistent adaptation of Krakauer's work.  But just like the book, the film will receive mixed reviews from audiences.  Some people simply can't (or won't) listen to McCandless.  Whether there exists within the viewer a connection to the natural world, a desire to discern the boundaries of mankind's ability to survive in a perilous environment and a hunger for incorruptible truth and sometimes painful honesty will play heavily into the reward/enjoyment of the film.Chris McCandless never outlived the phase many young adults experience in their years after college or high school when they first realize the ugliness of the world.  Penn's film traces the last years of his life, showing his hero to be wide-eyed and childlike, as he holds to a simplistic belief that people just need to be good to each other to make the most out of their short time on earth.  On his odyssey tramping throughout the West, McCandless encounters a Homer-like string of splendid characters.  But even with a string of rewarding relationships with people who view him with a aura of mysticism, a Holden Caulfield-like epiphanies about deceit and phoniness of the world draws Chris to the one place he knows he can find truth: into the wild.FILM DIFFERENCES/STRENGTHSThe most obvious difference in the book and the film is the ""suspense"" created by holding off his death until the end.  While the book is an investigation into a dead man (although we see him certainly as a very vivid and vital dead man), the film keeps him alive until the very end.  Viewers unfamiliar with the story may wonder why the tale is even being told, especially when it seems he is about to walk to safety.I don't consider myself among the ""the book is always better"" crowd, because I think the film medium allows for unambiguous depictions of images, scenery, etc.  I was unfamiliar with the Lake Mead canyons where he kayaked or the channels that floated him into Mexico.  No description in a book could help me see those things like the film does.  Penn also takes advantage of a great device where he uses uncomfortable camera angles and quick, jerky cuts whenever Chris is in a city and juxtaposes them with spectacular views from some of the more beautiful stops of Chris' life.",5,Faithful Adaptation of a Fine Book,1193097600,"10 23, 2007",2007,3927,"['*SPOILER', 'WARNING*', 'know', 'nothing', 'story', 'nearly', 'reviews', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'Therefore', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'anything', 'plot', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'reviews', 'including', 'one.The', 'book', 'cover', 'story', 'young', 'idealist', 'well-to-do', 'family', 'away', 'money', 'possessions', 'trudging', 'Alaskan', 'wild', 'quest', 'spiritual', 'awakening', 'Four', 'months', 'later', 'body', 'discovered', 'moose', 'hunters', 'Christopher', 'McCandless', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'reduced', 'few', 'words', 'so', 'why', 'do', 'readers', 'Jon', 'Krakauer', 'book', 'McCandless', 'trek', 'twenty', 'miles', 'unforgiving', 'wilderness', 'visit', 'final', 'resting', 'place', 'Why', 'become', 'center', 'cult-like', 'mythology', 'inspiration', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'graceful', 'biopic', 'Krakaeur', 'readers', 'Into', 'Wild', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'heard', 'McCandless', 'story', 'television', 'newspapers', 'crackling', 'fire', 'surrounded', 'wanderers', 'Penn', 'became', 'bewitched', 'young', 'man', 'so', 'certain', 'redemptive', 'power', 'natural', 'purity', 'self', 'reliance', 'isolation', 'cast', 'off', 'worldly', 'possessions', 'impressive', 'academic', 'career', 'Emory', 'University', 'tramped', 'Western', 'US', 'judgmental', 'critics', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'longing', 'McCandless', 'explore', 'life', 'innocence', 'untouched', 'trappings', 'society', 'Penn', 'felt', 'same', 'desires', 'set', 'out', 'capture', 'story', 'screen', 'Even', 'who', 'dislike', 'Penn', 'count', 'should', 'see', 'many', 'same', 'idealistic', 'uncompromising', 'traits', 'McCandless', 'same', 'subtle', 'disappointment', 'world', 'not', 'sharing', 'aesthetics.Penn', 'film', 'remarkably', 'consistent', 'adaptation', 'Krakauer', 'work', 'just', 'book', 'film', 'will', 'receive', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'audiences', 'people', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'listen', 'McCandless', 'viewer', 'connection', 'natural', 'world', 'desire', 'discern', 'boundaries', 'mankind', 'ability', 'survive', 'perilous', 'environment', 'hunger', 'incorruptible', 'truth', 'sometimes', 'painful', 'honesty', 'will', 'play', 'heavily', 'reward/enjoyment', 'film.Chris', 'McCandless', 'never', 'outlived', 'phase', 'many', 'young', 'adults', 'experience', 'years', 'college', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'first', 'realize', 'ugliness', 'world', 'Penn', 'film', 'last', 'years', 'life', 'showing', 'hero', 'be', 'wide-eyed', 'childlike', 'simplistic', 'belief', 'people', 'just', 'need', 'be', 'good', 'other', 'make', 'most', 'short', 'time', 'earth', 'odyssey', 'tramping', 'West', 'McCandless', 'Homer-like', 'string', 'splendid', 'characters', 'even', 'string', 'rewarding', 'relationships', 'people', 'who', 'view', 'aura', 'mysticism', 'Holden', 'Caulfield-like', 'epiphanies', 'deceit', 'phoniness', 'world', 'Chris', 'one', 'place', 'can', 'find', 'truth', 'wild.FILM', 'DIFFERENCES/STRENGTHSThe', 'most', 'obvious', 'difference', 'book', 'film', 'suspense', 'created', 'holding', 'off', 'death', 'end', 'book', 'investigation', 'dead', 'man', 'see', 'certainly', 'very', 'vivid', 'vital', 'dead', 'man', 'film', 'alive', 'very', 'end', 'Viewers', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'may', 'wonder', 'why', 'tale', 'even', 'being', 'told', 'especially', 'when', 'walk', 'safety.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'book', 'always', 'better', 'crowd', 'think', 'film', 'medium', 'unambiguous', 'depictions', 'images', 'scenery', 'etc', 'was', 'unfamiliar', 'Lake', 'Mead', 'canyons', 'where', 'kayaked', 'channels', 'floated', 'Mexico', 'description', 'book', 'could', 'help', 'see', 'things', 'film', 'Penn', 'also', 'advantage', 'great', 'device', 'where', 'uncomfortable', 'camera', 'angles', 'quick', 'jerky', 'cuts', 'whenever', 'Chris', 'city', 'spectacular', 'views', 'more', 'beautiful', 'stops', 'Chris', 'life']",N/A

Sean Penn's adaptation of Jon Krakauer's book of the same name is one of those films that is on par with the book.  While I prefer Krakauer's book by a small margin, this was a great film to watch.Emile Hirsch stars as Chris McCandless, bright Emory University graduate, who gives virtually all his possessions, donates his savings to Oxfam and ""drop outs"" of society to make his way to Alaska for a journey of self-discovery.  Penn's film is filled with superb performances by everyone from Vince Vaughn and Katherine Keener to William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden.  However, it is Hirsch in his portrayal of Chris and Hal Holbrooke in a remarkably deep and tender supporting role that really deliver stand out performances.Both the cinematography and the soundtrack are unbelievable -- providing a stark and open feeling that complement each other.  As Chris makes his way from the bustling urban city of Alaska to the remote environs of Alasaka, Penn creates the feel of a both a ""road"" and ""wilderness"" story without feeling like this is something we've seen before -- it had a unique and original gestalt to it.There are two critiques that I have of the movie:  (1) Penn's movie makes a stronger statement about the role of McCandless' upbringing that led to his complete abandonment from his family.  It certainly was not so explicitly addressed in Krakauer's book and the tension of this relationship provides for a more dramatic movie.  (2) When McCandless is in cinder-block city, I felt the whole ""romantic"" interlude with the young teen singer was gratuitous and detracted from the story for me.  I didn't feel we needed that encounter to further dramatize Chris' virtue and ""self-control"".While I loved botht the book and this movie, they both leave me with an unsettled feeling.  While many dismiss McCandless as naive and foolish, I felt both works led to a more troubled, nuanced sense of this young man.  Certainly there was a naivete to him, but he also was a lost soul, struggling to find his way in the world -- seeminly unmoved by the increasingly material world -- and without a real kindred spirit as he searched for his identity and meaning.  I was left with a sense of bewilderment that someone would make such a sudden and complete break from those who loved and cared about him -- and the fear and despair that this created with his loved ones.  Whether Chris found himself and was truly at peace in the wild, we'll never know.

1123207,A1EL1J7S2NC752,B000ZN802W,Zenbones,"[2, 3]","A great effort by Penn. This is an artful film without being over the top or sentimental.But, what I would really like to address, after reading the many 'bad' reviews here (and of the book) is something else entirely - something about the nature of Chris Mcandless, and the story that's being told here.Many people I have talked to, and who's reviews I have read are quite upset by Mcandless.They have called him idealistic and spoiled, mean spirited and selfish.Ultimately this is not about his upbringing or his parents or his selfish nature.Usually what we do outwardly only reflect the deeper issues that we all face as human beings. Perhaps this is the fault of Krakauer or Penn for illuminating this more - but I don't think so.If you cannot see the universal struggle for man in this story (for that is what the story is all about) then this film is definitely not for you.Although the film tells the story of Mcandless's life and the outward things that bother him  - the things that ultimately motivate him are something else altogether. I'm suggesting that the things that motivate him are the things that motivate all of us.At the end of the story Chris becomes forgiving, truly lets go, and I believe becomes truly happy - a life well lived in my opinion. How many people do you know that die in this way? Is it how long we live, or how we live that matters?The climax is the single most important element of the story. This is not just 'selfishness and idealism, but the need for a redemption that is only found when one truly gives up everything seeking it. And I do mean everything.The book is superior to the movie in my opinion, but the film does capture the spirit of Mcandless' struggle very well.",4,Misunderstood,1260057600,"12 6, 2009",2009,1717,"['great', 'effort', 'Penn', 'artful', 'film', 'being', 'top', 'sentimental.But', 'what', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'address', 'reading', 'many', 'reviews', 'here', 'book', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'something', 'nature', 'Chris', 'Mcandless', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'here.Many', 'people', 'have', 'talked', 'who', 'reviews', 'have', 'read', 'are', 'quite', 'upset', 'Mcandless.They', 'have', 'called', 'idealistic', 'spoiled', 'mean', 'spirited', 'selfish.Ultimately', 'not', 'upbringing', 'parents', 'selfish', 'nature.Usually', 'what', 'do', 'outwardly', 'only', 'reflect', 'deeper', 'issues', 'face', 'human', 'beings', 'Perhaps', 'fault', 'Krakauer', 'Penn', 'illuminating', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.If', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'universal', 'struggle', 'man', 'story', 'what', 'story', 'then', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'film', 'story', 'Mcandless', 'life', 'outward', 'things', 'bother', 'things', 'ultimately', 'motivate', 'are', 'something', 'else', 'altogether', ""'m"", 'suggesting', 'things', 'motivate', 'are', 'things', 'motivate', 'end', 'story', 'Chris', 'forgiving', 'truly', 'go', 'believe', 'becomes', 'truly', 'happy', 'life', 'well', 'lived', 'opinion', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'do', 'know', 'die', 'way', 'how', 'long', 'live', 'how', 'live', 'matters', 'climax', 'single', 'most', 'important', 'element', 'story', 'not', 'just', ""'selfishness"", 'idealism', 'need', 'redemption', 'only', 'found', 'when', 'one', 'truly', 'up', 'everything', 'seeking', 'do', 'mean', 'everything.The', 'book', 'superior', 'movie', 'opinion', 'film', 'capture', 'spirit', 'Mcandless', 'struggle', 'very', 'well']",N/A

Emile Hirsch did a fantastic job as the real life character, ""Alexander Supertramp"". He embodied the character and carried the movie.  I think he reason why I loved the movie so much is because I identify with Alexander Supertramp's belief system, except not to the extreme. I go through stages of wanting to give up on people and ""soceity"", but I'm not willing to isolate and rebel against something that is stronger than the powers that be.  Point in case, he died for his beiefs and it seemed he regreted some of the core of what he was trying to prove to himself with the scribble of a quote he enscribed in one of his novels ""happiness only real when shared"".  I think he realized when he was near death that isolation is not the answer.  But his journey was a self chosen path that I'm sure was his destiny, and in fact inspired many people he came in contact with.  In hindsight, I believe that in his mind and soul, his beilief was worth dying for.  It's rare to find that quality in human beings, so I commend him for that, but I disagree with some of his bizarre actions that led to his death.  There were also some contridictions to his core belief system in regards to ""money"".  The practical side of me asked questions like ""if you are so against the money system, why did you rely on other people's money that you came into contact with, which is borderline ""using people"" in my mind.  You can't escape the fact we all need money to survive in the end.  Aside from all the philosophical aspects of the film, I thought Sean Penn did a fantastic job directing. I also loved the music by Eddie Veder. On the weird front, there were some bizarre moments like the ""apple scene"" and the danish couple encounter and the MC Hammer song?  I was like ""whoa, ok...."".
