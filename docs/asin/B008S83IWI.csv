From his formative years he was a Beatles fan drawing pictures of the group and keeping a diary on his fandom, The Beatles even influenced his choice of career, musician. In emulation of The Beatles he was able to play the Cavern Club and people he met on that trip started sharing their Beatles stories with him. They were personal and mostly stories of chance meetings or how The Beatles changed their lives and Swirsky realized no one would probably hear these stories. He decided to capture those stories for posterity.Swirsky started filming the people as they told their Beatles stories and he started to solicit interviews from The Beatles contemporaries and a lot of them responded and were interviewed. Swirsky's ""Beatles Stories"" captures the stories of Beatles assistant's, fans, neighbors, business associates, former girlfriends and some of the more famous who had encounters with The Beatles. Some of the more famous interviewee's include Henry Winkler, Jon Voight, Brian Wilson (who had a grand rivalry with The Beatles), George Martin, just to name a few.A lot of the stories are very personal stories and are quite heartfelt accounts of encounters with The Beatles, it's especially interesting to see the celebrities interviewed who become fans in the telling of their meeting with The Beatles, some of the cooler ones are Henry Winkler, and Susanna Hoffs (who still seems to get starstruck at the telling of the story). Trying not too much to fall into reviewers clich&eacute;s some of the stories will make you laugh, cry and all emotions in-between, these stories are genuine and even though the people know their being interviewed are very candid and stripped of artifice, you'll find yourself moved by some of the stories, at the very least you'll be entertained.""Beatles Stories"" isn't necessarily for the hardcore Beatles fan either, a casual fan, like myself, will find the interviews interesting and the interviewees aren't arcane figures from The Beatles history, that even if you don't know who they are through their stories you'll discover who they are and where they fit in The Beatles story.",5,For All Fans!

The good news: I kept watching.  The anecdotes were wonderful and often touching.  Often the interviewees are celebrities themselves, but sometimes they are not - however most of the myriad interviews are impactful and heartfelt.This is a hard documentary to describe.  I didn't want to hear a bunch of people talking about how important the Beatles were to them.  Jeez, everyone I know could add to that. There was some of that in this documentary, but the best stories were about some first-person brush with one of the Beatles or their family members.  Some stories were funny, some were poignant, some were informative and all added to a fuller picture of those four PEOPLE, the Beatles.While all were enjoyable, the one that really made me laugh was from the former head of Capitol records, remembering the Beatles' signing.  He really liked Paul, thought John was a jerk, thought George's contribution was minimal and didn't think ""the drummer"" remarkable at all.  And the guy delivered these assessments so deadpan and so matter-of-factly - he STILL doesn't get it!At any rate, this documentary is more than what it appears.  My other reviewers were exactly correct:  it is a film worth viewing and worth owning.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[30, 30]","Seth Swirsky is not a professional filmmaker (and some of the camera work here shows that), but this is heck of a fascinating documentary project. Swirsky is a musician and a songwriter, with songs recorded by Taylor Dayne, Tina Turner, Al Green and Celine Dion, as well as themes for major motion pictures. But, after playing a gig in Hamburg and hearing stories from locals about the Beatles, he decided to contact a slew of well-known folks who interacted with the Fab Four during their career. How is got access to nearly 60 (mostly) celebrities like Sir George Martin, Graham Nash, Ben Kingley (actually a performing musician before turning to acting), Brian Wilson, Smokey Robinson, still amazes me! But I'm glad he did. The 85-minute film contains about 53 of these interviews - most lasting just a minute or two and a few were done by phone - with appropriate archival footage of the period to embelish them. Some of the stories are well know, but many aren't. And the connections with the Beatles run from the old-style comedy couple who shared the stage on the Ed Sullivan Show for the Beatles' debut to the guy who got the last autograph from John Lennon before he was murdered.The bonus features ad much to the fun as there are 30 minutes of ""bonus interviews"" for folks not featured in the theatrical version. And there is a nearly-25-minute extended interview with Norman ""Hurricane"" Smith, the Beatles first recording engineer.The project to film all these interviews (and get access to the interviewees - many recorded backstage at performances - took nearly seven years. I can't even imagine Swirsky's travel expenses! But, I think we should all be glad he did it.

Some of the stories have been told before, but most of them will be unfamiliar to even the most devoted Beatlemaniacs. Some of the people he talked to (George Martin, Norman Smith - Beatles engineer, Joey Molland of Badfinger, Denny Laine of Wings) had professional associations with the Beatles or an ex-Beatle. But others - like The Bangles' Susanna Hoffs, who happened to bump into Ringo at a party - tell starstruck stories of chance encounters.If you watch the whole movie and still want more, the DVD has you covered - 30 minutes of extra interviews.
