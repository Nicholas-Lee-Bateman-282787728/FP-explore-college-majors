989111,AIMR915K4YCN,B000FFJZDS,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[2, 2]","In TERROR IN THE SHADOWS, Marcy Walker plays a severely mentally ill woman who believes that her deceased baby is still alive. She was institutionalized after giving the boy up for adoption, only to change her mind, and kill the adoptive mother! During the melee, she accidentally broke the baby's neck. Years later, she escapes from the mental institution, and heads out to seek revenge on the adoptive father. Can he, along w/ his new wife and son survive? TERROR isn't bad for a made-for-TV production. It does have some sappy moments, but there's just (barely) enough suspense and murder to outweigh the silliness...",3,"""His Name Is Timmy!""...",1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,620,"['TERROR', 'IN', 'THE', 'SHADOWS', 'Marcy', 'Walker', 'severely', 'mentally', 'ill', 'woman', 'who', 'deceased', 'baby', 'still', 'alive', 'was', 'institutionalized', 'giving', 'boy', 'up', 'adoption', 'only', 'change', 'mind', 'kill', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'melee', 'accidentally', 'broke', 'baby', 'neck', 'Years', 'later', 'mental', 'institution', 'out', 'seek', 'revenge', 'adoptive', 'father', 'Can', 'w/', 'new', 'wife', 'son', 'survive', 'TERROR', ""n't"", 'bad', 'made-for-TV', 'production', 'have', 'sappy', 'moments', 'just', 'barely', 'enough', 'suspense', 'murder', 'outweigh', 'silliness']",Terror in the Shadows
