Myrna Loy is just great and Cary Grant is as great as ever in this movie.It is my understanding, Irene Dunne was going to play this part, but she turned it down.

28076,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,0780614097,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 20]","Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House was a witty, satirical ride that nearly gives us a better viewing than the infamous Money Pit, if it wasn't for that racist ending.  I know several of you will claim that the ending (without trying to give it away) was genuine for its time, and I understand that claim, but under today's standards this ending was extremely racist and should have been considered racist for the time of its release.  After witnessing this monumental ending, my jaw was on the ground.  I could not believe that I just finished a humorous Cary Grant film that promoted such a horrid ending.  I realize that I am going to be in the minority on this review, but I just couldn't fathom such an ending, and it really bothered me.  Outside of the ending, this film reminded me of that Saturday Night Live skit in which Will Ferrell and his family are sitting around the table talking about their day.  Out of the thousands it remains in my mind because Farrell classically gave some of his best lines ever.  The family would begin to argue and Farrell would just randomly yell out, ""I drive a Dodge Stratus, people fear me!""  It was hysterical in a waspy sort of way, and that was exactly what Grant brought to the table in this film.  With a charming story, simple characters, and a somewhat underdeveloped plot, Mr. Blandings becomes part comedy part disappointment.This film wasn't the greatest to showcase Grant's talent, but it did a decent job of telling a story and providing the viewer with some comedic entertainment.  For me, it was watching Grant and his family interact together.  The waspiness of their family structure was hysterical.  I loved the way that each one of them, from the children to the wife, chiseled away at each other.  If you watch this film from beginning to end you will see that there isn't much ""love"" demonstrated in this family, instead it is prissy children denouncing their father's career and a wife who seems to want more than they can afford.  In the end, you feel sorry for Grant because he is only trying to give his family the American dream, even if it takes away every penny he owns.  Sadly, this is a Hollywood movie, so we never see him paying bills or worrying about money, instead we only see smiling faces as debt continues to pile further and further up.  Grant was perfect in his role.  It was a much quieter role for him than what we have seen in the past, but it worked.  Grant's comedic timing was impeccable.  He captured the screen and never let go; I only wish I could say that about the rest of his cast. I just didn't feel that anyone else was really contributing to the cause.  They were playing their part, just not pushing the envelope.  Grant overshadowed the rest of his cast and it became less of an ensemble piece and more of another Cary Grant movie.  Sad, but in the same sense, it worked.If you have seen the film The Money Pit, than you have seen the outcome of this film.  The two are nearly identical sisters in the cinematic world.  Each stand on their own, giving something fresh to the Hollywood community, but I think Mr. Blandings steps ahead by just a photo finish.  There is something unique about this film, which I attribute to the other going-ons around the Blandings' world outside of this house renovation.  There is Mr. Blandings being the ultimate procrastinator, Mrs. Blandings proving that she is not having an affair with Mr. Blandings' best friend, and Gussie, trying to keep the entire family together with her racially award winning final dialogue.  It is fun to keep up with everything, but ultimately it just doesn't resolve itself.  I like all the obstacles that this family had to endure, but I never felt as if they had a complete ending.  The final moments of this film wrapped up one portion of this story, but failed miserably with the other loose ends.  We needed a more climactic ending, when instead we were left with nothing more than Hollywood hogwash ... smiling faces coupled with sunny skies.  I felt like asking that eternal question at the end of this film that was so notorious in the film Pleasantville, ""What's outside of Pleasantville?""  It would have fit perfectly.Finally, I would like to say that what could have saved this film were moments that could transcend time.  This should have been a milestone classic, the story of the American family going from their comfortable dwellings in the city straight to their freedom in the country, but instead the director, H.C. Potter, went with some dated themes that will always keep this film leveled in the 1940s.  The ending particularly will not brood well with today's standards, but the monetary moments in this film should have been left out.  It would have built for a stronger story.  I had trouble believing that a man making only $15,000 a year could afford all their spending.  If Potter would have just left their financial stability out of this picture, maybe I would have felt less connected to Grant's character, but I would have felt that the story worked better.  I just couldn't understand why Grant was spending, spending, spending.Overall, it was a good film, just not one that would have a lasting impression on my mind.  Grand did a great job, but was overshadowed by a feeble plot and racism. I loved the waspy nature of the family, but the dynamics were never solidified.  I didn't see this family actually living together, just pegs in the Hollywood American family used to keep the plot in motion.  Good, but not great.Grade: *** out of *****",3,What's outside of Pleasantville?,1127692800,"09 26, 2005",2005,5546,"['Mr.', 'Blandings', 'Builds', 'Dream', 'House', 'was', 'witty', 'satirical',

28078,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,0780614097,Alex Udvary,"[3, 5]","I first heard of this movie when it was named by the AFI as one of the funniest American comedies of all-time. This is allegedly the 72nd funniest movie you will ever see.""Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House"" has an awful lot going for it. First you have a wonderful cast including Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. And a script written by Melvin Frank and Norman Panama. And if your a Bob Hope fan you should know those two names. They are two of Hope's most trusted writers. They wrote such films as ""Monsieur Beaucaire"", ""My Favorite Blonde"" and two of the road pictures. ""Utopia"" and ""Hong Kong"".The basic premise of the movie is a couple (played by Grant & Loy) wants to move out of their small Manhattan apartment and build their own dream house. It may sound simple but it sure isn't simple for Grant and Loy to reach their goal. It's mishaps after mishaps. And they find themselves spending more and more money on a house they already can't afford.What I like best about the movie is the way everything is played serious. No matter what is happening the actors never act like they know what they are doing is funny. And that just makes it even more funny. Grant was a wonderful comedic actor. Most people may think of him as a serious actor but he did comedy just as well. Watch him in ""Bringing Up Baby"", ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" & one of my favorites ""The Awful Truth"". Myrna Loy is no slouch either. She of course is best known for the ""Thin Man"" series but appeared in several other comedies as well like ""Libeled Lady"", and ""Third Finger, Left Hand"" (Melvyn Douglas co-starred).I'm really not familiar with the director H.C. Potter. I've only seen two films he directed. ""The Story of Vernon & Irene Castle"" and ""The Miniver Story"". Neither I feel is a great movie. Especially ""The Miniver Story"". It's nowhere near as great as the original. But nonetheless he does as nice job directing this movie. He keeps a nice pace going along. The movie is about 95 minutes. So it moves briskly and nothing ""feels"" left out.If you like any of the actors in this movie or like old fashion comedies ""Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House"" will turn out to be a treat.Bottom-line: Very funny Cary Grant Myrna Loy comedy.

28079,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,0780614097,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[2, 2]","MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE is a bright 1948 movie about a middle-class Manhattan family that escapes its overcrowded apartment to design and build a ""dream house"" in then-rural Connecticut.  Anticipating THE MONEY PIT nearly forty years later, everything about the undertaking becomes twice as expensive and three times as difficult as originally thought, including dealing with the sly locals.  Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are perfect at this kind of polished, light entertainment that effortlessly mixes satire and slapstick yet never becomes overbearing.  Melvyn Douglas is on hand as the ""friend of the family"" to sharpen up things with his own sardonic viewpoint.  A very able supporting cast includes Lurene Tuttle, Jason Robards, a very young Lex Barker and Louise Beavers as the cheerful maid who cheerfully saves Cary Grant's . . .  bacon.

In this film, you can see the locals out-smarting the supposed sophisticated city folks (dig the exchange between Grant and the guy who is drilling his well).  And when Myrna Loy describes the shade of blue she wants for her sewing room (""not quite as light as a robin's egg"", etc.) and the interior designer pretends to listen carefully, and mutters ""un-huh"", then whispers to his associate ""Two quarts of blue"".  And when they are told that the farmhouse they bought is structually unsound and has to be torn down, they do so, only to be told that they had to have a permit or something before they did it!  The whole movie is like this, leading lambs to the slaughter.  But afterall the money is spent and time wasted, they finally get their dream house, and they consider it worth it.

The trouble starts when the house shows its age and has to be torn down...This movie is based on a book by the same name written by Eric Hodgins.  This is Cary Grant's 52nd movie, his third with Myrna Loy; the others being WINGS IN THE DARK in 1935, and THE BACHELOR AND THE BOBBY-SOXER in 1947.  Cary had just met Betsy Drake aboard the Queen Mary on his return trip from England, and she came to join him in California as he did this film.Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House stars Cary Grant and Myrna Loy as a New York couple attempting to leave the bustle of Manhattan for their dream house in the country.  This is a cute story about the trials and tribulations of building a new home.  The Blandings lived in New York City and in order to get away from the hustle and bustle, they decided to build a home in Connecticut.  It is Murphy's Law, and everything that can go wrong, goes wrong.The film begins in the overcrowded apartment occupied by the Blandings family... parents and two daughters. Wife wants to redecorate, husband doesn't want to spend thousands on an apartment, so soon they are buying an old house in Connecticut.The old house they buy, thinking of it as their dream house, soon shows itself to be a nightmare and has to be torn down. Soon they are busy planning to build a new house, and this is where the fun really begins!Things begin to go wrong from the start, when the the old house is torn down without the former owner's permission and he demands full payment on the mortgage.The &quot;dream house&quot; building takes on a life of its own, where everything that could go wrong, or cost more money, does. The whole thing seems almost out of control.Things work out in the end and the Blandings end up happy in their house, but the trials and tribulations they suffer along the way are something to watch and enjoy!!Cary and Myrna were very comfortable with each other and it shows on the screen.  This movie was filmed in sequence, which is hardly ever done in movie making.  This is a great movie for the family and if you are deciding to build a new home.Cary is at his greatest with his portrayal as a frustrated advertising man.  I believe that Cary had three different careers:  One from 1932 to 1937, when he played mostly cast-off roles and mediocre roles; then his second career from 1937, starting with THE AWFUL TRUTH, and ending with DREAM WIFE in 1953, when he decided to quit films, and then his third career, when Alfred Hitchcock lured him back to film making in 1955 with TO CATCH A THIEF, co-staring Grace Kelly, until his last film in 1966, WALK, DON'T RUN.With MR. BLANDINGS, he was in the middle of his second career, most attractive, and by this time was able to select his scripts and control much of what he was doing on the screen.

On the surface, it's one of those mild satires on city folks trying to create their ideal in the countryside, only to find crooked farmers, delapidated homesteads and extortionate builders.  But the film, made in 1947, pre-empts those great 50s melodramas in its look  at masculine dysfunction faced with the needs of family, over-achieving, work, money, the home etc.Cary Grant works in advertising, that archetypal American job in which fortunes are made despite producing nothing, but whose minions are one punchline away from failure, poverty and madness.  The brilliant, near-silent opening sequence shows Grant going through the banal rituals of waking up and going to work, only to find himself defeated at every turn by the things - family and home - he is supposed to be working for, leading to a loss in identity and authority figured in the shaving/mirror scene.  Even Potter's filming here, emphasising the domestic space as cramped and obstacle-laden, conspires against him.  The fact that escape from this world based on advertising is prompted by an advertisement suggests a vicious circle rather than true freedom.To compound Grant's woes is Melvyn Douglas, the film's smug narrator, a former flame of Myrna Loy who keeps popping in, organising things, undermining Grant's ability to run his own family.  There are tantalising, unresolved suggestions that the impish Loy and Douglas are still conducting an affair.  As the bills mount, the creativity with which Grant needs to survive economically, dries up.Situations primed for comedy here would, in less than a decade, be material for trauma in films like Nick Ray's 'Bigger than life'.  There are also satiric digs at national history, and the continued exploitation of racial minorities.  Needless to say, the acting of the three leads, the greatest comedians Hollywood ever produced, is subtle, playful, discreet, hilarious, and, most importantly, reticent.",4,Light comedy full of dark shadows.,1000857600,"09 19, 2001",2001,2052,"[""'Mr"", 'Blandings', 'been', 'called', 'inoffensive', 'comedy', 'middle-aged', 'actually', 'quite', 'dark', 'sly', 'film', 'surface', 'one', 'mild', 'satires', 'city', 'folks', 'trying', 'create', 'ideal', 'countryside', 'only', 'find', 'crooked', 'farmers', 'delapidated', 'homesteads', 'extortionate', 'builders', 'film', 'made', '1947', 'pre-empts', 'great', '50s', 'melodramas', 'look', 'masculine', 'dysfunction', 'faced', 'needs', 'family', 'over-achieving', 'work', 'money', 'home', 'etc.Cary', 'Grant', 'works', 'advertising', 'archetypal', 'American', 'job', 'fortunes', 'are', 'made', 'producing', 'nothing', 'minions', 'are', 'one', 'punchline', 'away', 'failure', 'poverty', 'madness', 'brilliant', 'near-silent', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Grant', 'going', 'banal', 'rituals', 'waking', 'up', 'going', 'work', 'only', 'find', 'defeated', 'turn', 'things', 'family', 'home', 'supposed', 'be', 'working', 'leading', 'loss', 'identity', 'authority', 'figured', 'shaving/mirror', 'scene', 'Even', 'Potter', 'filming', 'here', 'emphasising', 'domestic', 'space', 'cramped', 'obstacle-laden', 'conspires', 'fact', 'escape', 'world', 'based', 'advertising', 'prompted', 'advertisement', 'vicious', 'circle', 'rather', 'true', 'freedom.To', 'compound', 'Grant', 'woes', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'film', 'smug', 'narrator', 'former', 'flame', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'who', 'popping', 'organising', 'things', 'undermining', 'Grant', 'ability', 'run', 'own', 'family', 'are', 'tantalising', 'unresolved', 'suggestions', 'impish', 'Loy', 'Douglas', 'are', 'still', 'conducting', 'affair', 'bills', 'mount', 'creativity', 'Grant', 'survive', 'economically', 'dries', 'up.Situations', 'primed', 'comedy', 'here', 'would', 'less', 'decade', 'be', 'material', 'trauma', 'films', 'Nick', 'Ray', ""'Bigger"", 'life', 'are', 'also', 'satiric', 'digs', 'national', 'history', 'continued', 'exploitation', 'racial', 'minorities', 'Needless', 'say', 'acting', 'three', 'leads', 'greatest', 'comedians', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'produced', 'subtle', 'playful', 'discreet', 'hilarious', 'most', 'importantly', 'reticent']",N/A

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 3]","I know they run only nonfiction shows, but HGTV should rerun ""Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House"" regularly, just as a warning to starry-eyed homeowners. Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are absolutely hilarious in this homebuyer's comedy, but the real star is their dream house.... and the hideous flaws with it.The Blandings family live in a New York apartment, where they fight daily for closet and bathroom space. But then Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) gets a brilliant idea -- buy a charming house in the country, fix it up, and live in rural charm. Unfortunately, he quickly gets tangled up in a heap of mortgage problems, and gets cheated by the former owner.And once those are sorted out, they get professional opinions (""Tear it down!"") which lead to major demolition. Undaunted, Jim and Muriel (Myrna Loy) help design a brilliant new house, only to encounter a new array of setbacks. As Jim tries to deal with the strain, he suspects that his marriage is coming apart.Personally I consider having a new house built to be from the fifth circle of hell, especially if you have to oversee the details yourself. Apparently HC Potter did too, since the movie is crammed with subtle jabs at demanding homebuyers, trendy decorators, and those guys who send the windowpanes to the wrong town.The movie basically trundles along the increasingly bumpy road of buying land and building a house, although it becomes somewhat slack when Jim suspects that Muriel is cheating on him. Fortunately the dialogue is hilarious from beginning to end (""The house just needs someone to love it, that's all!"" ""Good thing there are two of you. One to love it and one to hold it up"").Mr. Blandings reminds me of some homebuyers I'm related to -- he has more optimism than any person can have, unless he is completely out of touch with reality. And Cary Grant makes you laugh WITH and AT Jim. Loy is solid and witty as the long-suffering wife, and Melvyn Douglas does his dry best as their best buddy.The moral of this movie: Pursuing your dream house will probably be a nonstop nightmare, even if you look like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy.

Of course, it helps to have a trio of expert farceurs - Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and an especially acerbic Melvyn Douglas - head the proceedings with their natural likeability at odds with the escalating frustrations of home ownership. Even though the film is sixty years old now, there is a timeless quality to the Blandings' dream and the barriers they face in achieving it. Obviously, Hollywood thinks so since it's been remade at least twice - first as a very physical Tom Hanks comedy, 1986'sThe Money Pit, and again last year with Ice Cube'sAre We Done Yet?. One look at HGTV's programming schedule will show you how the situations explored here still resonate today.The plot begins with ad man Jim Blandings, his wife Muriel and their two daughters cramped into a two bedroom-one bath Manhattan apartment. Rather than pursue Muriel's idea to renovate the apartment for $7,000, Jim sees a photo of a Connecticut house in a magazine and realizes this is where they need to move. With the help of an opportunistic real estate agent and against the advice of their attorney and family friend Bill Cole, the Blandings decide to buy a ramshackle house badly in need of repair. However, the foundation sags so badly that the house needs to be torn down in favor of a new one. This sparks the Blandings to push the architect to design a house so excessive that the second floor is twice as big as the first. Costs rise with each new complication, tempers flare, and even a romantic triangle is imagined among Jim, Muriel and Bill. Priorities finally sort themselves out but not before some funny slapstick scenes and clever dialogue that tweaks the not-so-blissful ignorance of the new homeowners.With his double takes and flawless line delivery, Grant is infallible in this type of farce, and Jim Blandings epitomizes his more domesticated mid-career characters. In a role originally meant for Irene Dunne, Myrna Loy shows why she was Hollywood's perfect wife. She doesn't get many of the funnier lines, but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make Muriel an appealing character on her own. Watch her deftly maneuver the overly agreeable house painter with her absurdly idiosyncratic color palette. As avuncular, pipe-smoking Bill (""Cole...Bill Cole""), Melvyn Douglas shows his natural, easy-going &eacute;lan as Grant's foil and the story's jaundiced narrator. Smaller roles are filled expertly with particularly memorable turns by Harry Shannon as the laconic well-digger Mr. Tesander, Lurene Tuttle as Jim's officious assistant Mary, and Louise Beavers as the Blandings' lovable maid Gussie. The 2004 DVD provides some intriguing vintage material including two radio versions of the movie - the first a 1949 version that did end up pairing Grant and Dunne and then a second 1950 version coupling Grant with his then-wife, actress Betsy Drake. A most appropriate 1949 cartoon, ""The House of Tomorrow"", is also included giving us a comical tour of a futuristic dream house. The original theatrical trailers for ten of Grant's film classics complete the extras.",4,Post-WWII Housing Boom Provides Fodder for a Sharply Played Domestic Comedy,1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,3522,"['Coinciding', 'start', 'baby', 'boom', 'years', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'saw', 'unprecedented', 'exodus', 'Americans', 'moving', 'city', 'apartments', 'suburbs', 'where', 'could', 'fulfill', 'dreams', 'owning', 'own', 'homes', 'Directed', 'H.C.', 'Potter', 'co-written', 'Norman', 'Panama', 'Melvin', 'Frank', 'White', 'Christmas', 'lightweight', 'surprisingly', 'observant', '1948', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'feeling', 'period', 'very', 'well', 'course', 'have', 'trio', 'expert', 'farceurs', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'especially', 'acerbic', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'head', 'proceedings', 'natural', 'likeability', 'odds', 'escalating', 'frustrations', 'home', 'ownership', 'Even', 'film', 'sixty', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'timeless', 'quality', 'Blandings', 'dream', 'barriers', 'face', 'achieving', 'Obviously', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'been', 'remade', 'least', 'twice', 'first', 'very', 'physical', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'comedy', ""1986'sThe"", 'Money', 'Pit', 'again', 'last', 'year', 'Ice', ""Cube'sAre"", 'Done', 'Yet', 'One', 'look', 'HGTV', 'programming', 'schedule', 'will', 'show', 'how', 'situations', 'explored', 'here', 'still', 'resonate', 'today.The', 'plot', 'ad', 'man', 'Jim', 'Blandings', 'wife', 'Muriel', 'two', 'daughters', 'cramped', 'two', 'bedroom-one', 'bath', 'Manhattan', 'apartment', 'Rather', 'pursue', 'Muriel', 'idea', 'renovate', 'apartment', '7,000', 'Jim', 'photo', 'Connecticut', 'house', 'magazine', 'realizes', 'where', 'need', 'move', 'help', 'opportunistic', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'advice', 'attorney', 'family', 'friend', 'Bill', 'Cole', 'Blandings', 'decide', 'buy', 'ramshackle', 'house', 'badly', 'need', 'repair', 'However', 'foundation', 'so', 'badly', 'house', 'be', 'torn', 'down', 'favor', 'new', 'one', 'Blandings', 'push', 'architect', 'design', 'house', 'so', 'excessive', 'second', 'floor', 'twice', 'as', 'big', 'first', 'Costs', 'rise', 'new', 'complication', 'tempers', 'flare', 'even', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'imagined', 'Jim', 'Muriel', 'Bill', 'Priorities', 'finally', 'sort', 'out', 'not', 'funny', 'slapstick', 'scenes', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'not-so-blissful', 'ignorance', 'new', 'homeowners.With', 'double', 'flawless', 'line', 'delivery', 'Grant', 'infallible', 'type', 'farce', 'Jim', 'Blandings', 'more', 'domesticated', 'mid-career', 'characters', 'role', 'originally', 'meant', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'why', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'perfect', 'wife', ""n't"", 'get', 'many', 'funnier', 'lines', 'special', 'blend', 'flightiness', 'sauciness', 'make', 'Muriel', 'appealing', 'character', 'own', 'Watch', 'deftly', 'overly', 'agreeable', 'house', 'painter', 'absurdly', 'idiosyncratic', 'color', 'palette', 'avuncular', 'pipe-smoking', 'Bill', 'Cole', 'Bill', 'Cole', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'natural', 'easy-going', 'eacute', 'Grant', 'foil', 'story', 'jaundiced', 'narrator', 'Smaller', 'roles', 'are', 'filled', 'expertly', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'turns', 'Harry', 'Shannon', 'laconic', 'well-digger', 'Mr.', 'Tesander', 'Lurene', 'Tuttle', 'Jim', 'officious', 'assistant', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Beavers', 'Blandings', 'lovable', 'maid', 'Gussie', '2004', 'DVD', 'intriguing', 'vintage', 'material', 'including', 'two', 'radio', 'versions', 'movie', 'first', '1949', 'version', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'pairing', 'Grant', 'Dunne', 'then', 'second', '1950', 'version', 'coupling', 'Grant', 'then-wife', 'actress', 'Betsy', 'Drake', 'most', 'appropriate', '1949', 'cartoon', 'House', 'Tomorrow', 'also', 'included', 'giving', 'comical', 'tour', 'futuristic', 'dream', 'house', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'ten', 'Grant', 'film', 'classics', 'complete', 'extras']",N/A

28122,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,0780614097,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","MR. BLANDING BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE (1948, 94 minutes) is your basic silly Cary Grant comedy vehicle, though not at all bad. Myrna Loy appears here as his long-suffering wife.Mr. Blanding is an advertizing exec at the end of his rope: his job has become a bore and his apartment is tiny. His two daughters are showing danger signs of becoming more expensive by the year and will obviously want to live at home even when college rolls around - so Mr. Blanding finds his dream house in Connecticut. The only trouble is that it is a slanted, collapsing 18th century disaster.The fun of course is watching Mr. Blanding have a meltdown as his house becomes, well, THE MONEY PIT. Unlike that unworthy remake starring a very young Tom Hanks, this Cary Grant comedy has signs of greatness to it. His one-liner-spouting possibly gay pal, played by Melvyn Douglas, actually offers some modern sanity and calmness that we still appreciate today.I was particularly charmed by the wonderful Louise Beavers (a/k/a Louise Beaver) as the Blandings' housekeeper Gussie. This lady reminded me of another great favorite, Loretta Devine, and you will enjoy the way she saves Mr. Blandings' bacon at the end of this romp. Louise Beavers, a very well educated and accomplished lady, detested cooking though she was highly in demand for the so-called ""mammy"" roles, usually portraying a cook.The film has everything a wholesome comedy needs, a little quirky gay-themed humor that you will miss if you blink, and really sympathetic characters.In short, I cannot think of a reason how this can be a mediocre or poor film. It is fun, the kids should see it, and the beloved immortal Cary Grant will always be a universe away from George Clooney.",5,"""You've been taken to the cleaners and you don't even know your pants are off!""",1343952000,"08 3, 2012",2012,1719,"['MR.', 'BLANDING', 'BUILDS', 'HIS', 'DREAM', 'HOUSE', '1948', '94', 'minutes', 'basic', 'silly', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'comedy', 'vehicle', 'not', 'bad', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'here', 'long-suffering', 'wife.Mr', 'Blanding', 'advertizing', 'exec', 'end', 'rope', 'job', 'become', 'bore', 'apartment', 'tiny', 'two', 'daughters', 'are', 'showing', 'danger', 'signs', 'becoming', 'more', 'expensive', 'year', 'will', 'obviously', 'want', 'live', 'home', 'even', 'when', 'college', 'rolls', 'Mr.', 'Blanding', 'dream', 'house', 'Connecticut', 'only', 'trouble', 'slanted', 'collapsing', '18th', 'century', 'disaster.The', 'fun', 'course', 'watching', 'Mr.', 'Blanding', 'have', 'meltdown', 'house', 'well', 'MONEY', 'PIT', 'unworthy', 'remake', 'starring', 'very', 'young', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'comedy', 'signs', 'greatness', 'one-liner-spouting', 'possibly', 'gay', 'pal', 'played', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'actually', 'modern', 'sanity', 'calmness', 'still', 'appreciate', 'today.I', 'was', 'particularly', 'charmed', 'wonderful', 'Louise', 'Beavers', 'a/k/a', 'Louise', 'Beaver', 'Blandings', 'housekeeper', 'Gussie', 'lady', 'reminded', 'great', 'favorite', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'will', 'enjoy', 'way', 'Mr.', 'Blandings', 'bacon', 'end', 'romp', 'Louise', 'Beavers', 'very', 'well', 'educated', 'accomplished', 'lady', 'detested', 'cooking', 'was', 'highly', 'demand', 'so-called', 'mammy', 'roles', 'usually', 'portraying', 'cook.The', 'film', 'everything', 'wholesome', 'comedy', 'needs', 'little', 'quirky', 'gay-themed', 'humor', 'will', 'miss', 'blink', 'really', 'sympathetic', 'characters.In', 'short', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'reason', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'mediocre', 'poor', 'film', 'fun', 'kids', 'should', 'see', 'beloved', 'immortal', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'universe', 'away', 'George', 'Clooney']",N/A
28123,A1X44LCV427TRE,0780614097,Elaine J. Campbell,"[6, 7]","As a Turner Classic Movie, Robert Osborn says in his introduction to this film that Cary Grant and Myrna Loy were ""old pals,"" since they starred in two earlier films together.  Loy said making the film was ""pure heaven,"" while Grant said he liked working with Loy because, to paraphrase, she was a true actress.  The film was also shot in sequence, a rarity in cinema making.This must explain why Grant and Loy seem so relaxed and at ease with one another, and with the exemplary story and script, fine direction by H.C. Potter, and surely one of the best performances by both Loy and Grant, this film really excels.  It is thoroughly interesting and enjoyable.  And Melvyn Douglas is no slouch either; in fact, he also is terrific.  Plus there is Louise Beavers as their housekeeper, and the two daughters are just right (played by Connie Marshall and Sharon Moffat).The story is about affluent city people who get so cramped and frustrated with apartment living that they opt to buy a house in the country.  As the film's title reveals, the viewer is ultimately in for a session of house building.  All because these two delightful characters lead with their hearts despite their total inexpertise, leaving their heads somewhere back in the city.  Logic and common sense are offered by their steady friend, a lawyer (Melvyn Douglas).  But he always gives them too much when it is too late.  Nevertheless, the result satisfies all (even if Grant's character does have to get up at 5:00 a.m. for the rest of his working life in order to commute on the only morning train), especially the film viewer.  There's lots of laughs and lots of smiles.  It leaves one with the sense of having had lots of fun.

The story is narrated by their friend and lawyer Bill, well played by Melvyn Douglas, a cynical man who learns it's easier to just let them make their mistakes.  Grant is the perfect actor to express the exasperation of the whole process.  The man had amazing comedic timing, deceptively making it look easy.  The script hits all of the potential problems with building, and the film is smoothly produced.  This is the kind of comedy that will appeal to most people, because almost everyone has had the opportunity to experience the joy that is remodelling, landscaping, decorating, or building.  There's something in here for everyone to appreciate.",4,"Been There, Done That",995673600,"07 21, 2001",2001,970,"['Cary', 'Grant', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'have', 'very', 'comfortable', 'chemistry', 'together', 'comedy', 'couple', 'get', 'cramped', 'city', 'apartment', 'move', 'out', 'country', 'stubborness', 'sheer', 'ignorance', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'number', 'expensive', 'errors', 'attempt', 'build', 'dream', 'house', 'story', 'narrated', 'friend', 'lawyer', 'Bill', 'well', 'played', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'cynical', 'man', 'who', 'easier', 'just', 'let', 'make', 'mistakes', 'Grant', 'perfect', 'actor', 'express', 'exasperation', 'whole', 'process', 'man', 'had', 'amazing', 'comedic', 'timing', 'deceptively', 'making', 'look', 'easy', 'script', 'potential', 'problems', 'building', 'film', 'smoothly', 'produced', 'kind', 'comedy', 'will', 'appeal', 'most', 'people', 'almost', 'everyone', 'had', 'opportunity', 'experience', 'joy', 'remodelling', 'landscaping', 'decorating', 'building', 'something', 'here', 'everyone', 'appreciate']",N/A

They also have a cheerful black maid that prepares coffee and all the meals.When they decide to move to rural Ct., and have more space, they have no clue what this undertaking will involve.Myrna Loy's litttle head can't comprehend the problem with the rising cost of the project.  Cary Grant is beyond patient. He loves his wife and wants to make her happy.I noticed in a busy diner in N.Y. a sign that read ""Hot dogs 15cents"". Also observed how Myrna awoke every morning with her hair and makeup perfectly in place.The story involves one unforeseen problem after another. Again, on the jacket of the video, it's claimed that this ""very funny nightmare that left audiences laughing in `1948, will have you in stitches too.""Not so much.Personally, I enjoy wholesome movies with intersting story lines that have pep.

When you buy that first house--be it new or &quot;previously enjoyed&quot;--it's amazing sometimes how many unforeseen problems can arise that result in more and more bills ! I'm sure that, even today, many of us can identify with the hurdles faced by the couple in &quot;Mr. Blandings&quot;.Cary Grant stars as advertising whiz, Jim Blandings. He lives in a cramped New York apartment with his wife ( marvellous Myrna Loy ),two young daughters, and live-in maid ( Louise Beavers ). Tired of battling for time in the bathroom, closet space, privacy etc., he decides to look into acquiring a house, preferably out in the country, away from the Manhattan rat race.He and his wife are shown an old house in the beautiful Connecticut countryside--and--definitely throwing caution to the wind--and--without consulting his best friend/lawyer ( a droll, sardonic Melvyn Douglas )--they buy the place. It would be unfair to reveal more of the plot--let's just say that the house can be described as a &quot;fixer-upper&quot; !This is a perfect role for Cary Grant--he is, as ever, suave, charming and funny, as well as embarrassed, befuddled and frustrated when facing one problem after another. His reactions, double-takes and expressions of incredulity are priceless. As Mrs. Blandings, Myrna Loy again proves that she is one of the great leading ladies of film--witty, sophisticated, smart and beautiful--her character is a full partner to her husband, rather than just a &quot;rose in his lapel&quot;. By all accounts, Ms. Loy would not have had it any other way.Melvyn Douglas also registers as the Blandings' lawyer, who--just to spice things up even more--was one of Mrs. Blandings old beaux from her college days. Supporting players are all fine, including &quot;B&quot; movie stalwart, Nestor Paiva, and--soon to be the screen's next Tarzan--Lex Barker.The DVD exhibits a clear B &amp; W image. Extras include quite a few trailers for other Cary Grant films, two radio shows with Cary, and a delightful, colour Tex Avery cartoon, &quot;House of Tomorrow&quot;.So--take a witty script--sharp direction--add Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas--and you have a real winner.

This is their story, one of many millions in 1948.Mr. Blandings, played by Cary Grant decides to look for a big, roomy house in Conneticut. He and his wife, Mrs Blandings, played by Myrna Loy, find themselves in deep doo-doo. Their lawyer/business manager, Mr.Cole, played by  Melvyn Douglas, tries to keep costs down. Unfortunately, Mr. Blandings bulls ahead on his own, purchasing an estate that is falling apart, and then deciding to build his dream house. The construction of the new Blandings home is slowed down by many things, and of course  problems arise everyday.This is a sometimes humorous film, but it is, indeed, time centered, in 1948, so much of the humor is stretched thin. Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are excellent and have good chemistry.  The story is, of course, timeless, and it is an entertaining film. Don't expect too much drama, it is light hearted fare, and meant to stay that way. The children, the cook, and all the construction workers give this film interest. Note that everyone, all males, wear hats when working. Not the baseball like caps we are used to, but real hats. Days of yore.

28168,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,0780614097,Robert Badgley,"[2, 2]","""Mr Blandings Builds His Dream House"" is a wonderful tale running the full gamut of emotion from farce and romanticism to drama,with alot of dry humour thrown in for good measure.Much of the latter comes from Melvyn Douglas,the Blandings close friend and lawyer.The Blandings,mister played by Cary Grant and the misses played by Myrna Loy,live in a ""cliff hugger""(apartment) in the big apple.Cary works for an advert agency and provides the families single source of income for his family which includes two daughters, and the extended family of one bird and a maid.The movie starts off right away emphasizing with subtle humour the cramped quarters of a dwelling they have collectively outgrown.One day Melvyn drops in for a visit to discuss plans for a ""small"" renno that Cary is totally unaware of.Cary balks at the $7,000 price tag being bandied about and heads to work.When he arrives it seems Cary has been suddenly handed an account which a now-fired peer couldn't put away.While he considers how his day is going he spots an ad in a magazine which boasts about living in Connecticut.He gets a brainstorm and next day he and Myrna are house hunting in said state.The house they settle on is one that is so decrepit that it is practically falling apart before their eyes.But both have their own fantasies about what it would look like fixed up,and after all it's just needs a bit ""of love"",as Myrna puts it.Melvyn their lawyer,is beside himself when he hears what they've gotten themselves into.They've been taken price wise but Cary is adamant that some things you should ""buy from the heart"".Back at their dream home  it seems that the home that just needs""love"",has to be torn down.In fact an architect by the name of Simms,played by screen veteran Reginald Denny,is enlisted to build a new one in its' stead.The work begins but with each successive day after painful day the cost of the house just keeps skyrocketing.Frustration runs rampant with the Blandings and it threatens to tear the two of them apart.To top matters the apartment building they currently live in gives them a 30 day eviction notice! Work continues and when they finally move in the house is miraculously nearly complete,except for the one side which has no windows;and which coincidentally is the side in which the bedrooms are on.It also seems the missus has misread the train schedule from Connecticut to New York.Cary has to get up an hour earlier to catch it.Then there is a little matter of Melvyn and Myrna.It seems they are getting a little more cozier than Cary would like.Cary complains that every time Melvyn leaves he shakes his hand and kisses his wife.Myrna responds by asking would he prefer it the other way around? When the movie is nearing its conclusion Cary has not put away that important account that he took over at work and the deadline has come and gone and he wants to sell the house and get back to the ""quiet and peaceful"" existence that he had before all this started.Melvyn however kiboshes that feeling by saying that even though he's been against the entire project from start to finish that upon reflection maybe they do have a lovely home and maybe there are some things that one should ""buy with the heart and not the mind"".With that statement Cary's thoughts change in an instance and also at that moment his maid happens to come up with a perfect slogan for the advert campaign he so desperately needs.The movie ends in a novel way(no pun intended),with a shot of Cary reading a book of the same title as the movie(one he's presumably written) with Myrna and Melvyn there asking us to drop by the house some time.Fade out.As the plot progresses the mood of the film changes on a dime depending on what is happening.Many moments are serious but usually contain bits of comedy in them.One such instance is a conversation that Cary has with a man who is drilling his well.As costs are rising so is Carys' frustration  as the man has already drilled a good 150 ft with no luck.A serious Cary asks the man several questions and with each reply comes either a ""yep"" or ""nope"",it is hilarious.Myrna has her moments too.An especially funny one occurs when she describes in minute detail to the head painter the exact colour scheme/shades she wants each room in.When she goes off for a moment he turns to his assistant and asks whether he got all that and he replies with ""Yeah;red,yellow,green and white"".It is a credit to the screenwriters that they never have the characters getting so mad to the point of shouting at one another or worse.Both exhibit a frustration alright(especially Cary) but both have their limit and exhibit a more controlled patience throughout(especially Myrna).If they had gone into a more confrontational mode that would have taken the movie to an entirely different level and really negated any effect humour would have had on the proceedings.Furthermore it gives us the audience more empathy and understanding for all involved and the frustrations and reactions that take place.No,it is smartly written and smartly played by all involved.Technically the film has been transferred fairly well.There are a few areas where more work could have been done but it is passable as it is.Included on the DVD is an hilarious Tex Avery cartoon of that year ""The House Of Tomorrow"",trailers and two radio air shots with Grant and Irene Dunne and Grant and Betsy Drake.In concluding I must say this is a film that is a classic of its kind and I think a must have for every serious film lover.It's got everything a good film should possess,great actors,great direction and and a great script from which to work from.Once you've visited the Blandings house once,you will want to return again and again.",4,A Dream of a movie-! 4 1/2 Stars,1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,5727,"['Mr', 'Blandings', 'Builds', 'Dream', 'House', 'wonderful',

Cary Grant &amp; Myrna Loy are irrestible in this charming tale of a married couple with two daughters who decide to build their dream home. Grant, who is reluctant to build the dream house from the onset, gets more then he bargained for, and enough mishaps to cause him  endless grief.  The way Grant and Loy play off one another is phenominal.  He plays a tough, grumpy husband who is a softy at heart that gives into his wife's wishes.  She plays the sweet, innocent wife who knows how to charm her way into getting what she wants.

28175,A1XEFHQZP8Y35W,0780614097,Silver Screen,"[10, 11]","Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas star in this little gem from 1948, where Grant plays Jim Blandings, a marketing executive who lives in a cramped New York City apartment with practical wife Muriel (Loy), two daughters, Joan and Betsy, maid Gussie (Louise Beavers), bird Theodore and has best friend Bill Cole (Douglas).  Muriel is pushing to renovate their apartment, to make more space, but Jim, after seeing an ad for beautiful Connecticut, decides that maybe they need to move out of the city and purchase a home.  Being a comedy, and a comedy with Grant, Loy AND Douglas, you know it won't be a simple procedure.  Their dream home turns out to be falling down and rebuilding turns out to be almost more work than they can take.What makes this film sparkle are the lead performances - - Grant, as always, excels in the comedic roles in which he plays an almost unsuspecting comedian.  The only other actor that I think could have done justice to this part would perhaps be the always stellar William Powell, who had such witty chemistry with Loy.  Loy shows a constant poise and straightforwardness that plays well off Grant's bumbling comedy.  Douglas, who I think was a sadly underrated and underused actor, is wonderful as the best friend ""Cole.  Bill Cole.  Friend of the family.""  He is the straight man to Grant, with some razor sharp dialogue.Although this movie was remade in sorts as ""The Money Pit"" in the 1980s with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long, I would advise to pass on the 80s version - although Hanks and Long are fine actors, ""Pit"" misses the warmth, the comedic flair and the down-home goodness that ""Blandings"" offers - - making the original a far superior film.
