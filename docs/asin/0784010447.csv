All-too-conveeeeniently, a man named Walter appears at the antique shop, ready to lend an all-too-understanding ear. Soon, Faith is in the sack w/ this all-too-empathetic Romeo. Guilt-ridden, Faith flees back home in order to wallow in her agony. Oh joy! Faith finds out that she was wrong about Richard! Yay! Now, they can live a life of domestic bliss! What the... ? Oh yeah, what about Walter? Well, it turns out that lover-boy just happens to have a few problems, including the fact that he's a relentless, homicidal psychopath! He starts out right away by stalking Faith and bumping off a nosey neighbor. Next, Faith's best friend gets a little too snoopy. I think you can see where this is going! Can Faith unload this maniac before she and those around her wind up dead? THE FIANCE is sort of FATAL ATTRACTION w/ the roles reversed. The moral of the story?

Those of us who were around in Lifetime's early days remember their two-hour afternoon movie -- often similar themes, but beautiful sets, good acting, and real dialogue, without an intrusive and neverending soundtrack.  This is one of them, from 1997.William R. Moses appears here as the male lead and always delivers.  Lysette Anthony did a few of Lifetime's earlier movies and is also very good -- her British accent adds to her charm.  We can pretty much guess the storyline and ending, but the movie has interesting twists and diversions.Worth an evening watch.",4,One of the better old Lifetime movies,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,657,"['great', 'feature', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'access', 'free', 'movies', 'many', 'oldies', 'goodies', 'who', 'were', 'around', 'Lifetime', 'early', 'days', 'remember', 'two-hour', 'afternoon', 'movie', 'often', 'similar', 'themes', 'beautiful', 'sets', 'good', 'acting', 'real', 'dialogue', 'intrusive', 'neverending', 'soundtrack', 'one', '1997.William', 'R.', 'Moses', 'here', 'male', 'lead', 'always', 'delivers', 'Lysette', 'Anthony', 'did', 'few', 'Lifetime', 'earlier', 'movies', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'British', 'accent', 'charm', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'guess', 'storyline', 'ending', 'movie', 'interesting', 'twists', 'diversions.Worth', 'evening', 'watch']",Fiance VHS
