1423016,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B004OEIN8O,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 4/13Rate: 5/54/13: Elvis: Summer of `56 tells an interesting story about how a local girl from Biloxi, Mississippi had fallen in love with Elvis Presley who was not yet an international star. This one is one of the most fascinating stories I've watched. There are plenty of rare never-seen-before footage of young Elvis Presley, all shot in color. It is surprising how much of the reel was used up back then to capture an important piece of Elvis' biography. All in all, Elvis: Summer of `56 is a must-see.",5,A Fascinating Piece of History.,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,514,"['Viewed', '4/13Rate', '5/54/13', 'Elvis', 'Summer', '56', 'tells', 'interesting', 'story', 'how', 'local', 'girl', 'Biloxi', 'Mississippi', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'international', 'star', 'one', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'are', 'plenty', 'rare', 'never-seen-before', 'footage', 'young', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'shot', 'color', 'surprising', 'how', 'much', 'reel', 'was', 'used', 'up', 'back', 'then', 'capture', 'important', 'piece', 'Elvis', 'biography', 'Elvis', 'Summer', '56', 'must-see']",N/A

1423020,A3US0VOOEK3VZ8,B004OEIN8O,R. West,"[1, 1]",Summer of '56 is a short look at the time Elvis spent with June Juanico. The short show covers interviews from June and some of her friends and family and footage of some time she spent with the King. It was neat to see them fishing on a friend's boat and playing in the sunshine. Of course it is all in black and white but it could never dull out Elvis. He is quite young here.I really enjoyed it.,5,look at Elvis and June,1398988800,"05 2, 2014",2014,398,"['Summer', ""'56"", 'short', 'look', 'time', 'Elvis', 'spent', 'June', 'Juanico', 'short', 'show', 'interviews', 'June', 'friends', 'family', 'footage', 'time', 'spent', 'King', 'was', 'neat', 'see', 'fishing', 'friend', 'boat', 'playing', 'sunshine', 'course', 'black', 'white', 'could', 'never', 'dull', 'out', 'Elvis', 'quite', 'young', 'here.I', 'really', 'enjoyed']",N/A
