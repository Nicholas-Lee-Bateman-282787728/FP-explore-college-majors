436974,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,6304826168,Alistair McHarg,"[3, 5]","The House Of Yes (horrible title!) is a bizarre, dark comedy with much to like, and dislike - ultimately it feels like an interminable, one-gadget shaggy dog story.The plot is loopy; suspension of disbelief is one thing, dumb is another.  (Why is it that criminal insanity among society's elite seems somehow reasonable to audiences, and excuses shabby construction?)A wealthy and oddly detached widow has raised her twins, (one male, one female), and their dimwitted half-brother, in an elegant, stately home. The woman is unapologetically vague about the fathers of these children, except to say they were definitely not her late husband.  The twins are inappropriately close, even for twins.  The girl, who may have killed the father, has an obsession with Jackie-O.  The boy twin, attempting to flee this unholy dynamic, has brought his fiancee to ""meet the family.""  The girl twin is pathologically threatened, causing her insanity to kick up a few notches.This synopsis may sound far-fetched but it barely scratches the surface.  Happily there are some splendid performances and snappy dialogue.  Parker Posey is downright brilliant as Jackie-O, an extreme part she might easily have overdone.  Posey gets many of the best lines and delivers them with a chilling combination of intelligence, madness, malice, and terror.Tori Spelling is a pleasant surprise.  As ""the outsider"" who wanders into an unsafe, horrific world, she adroitly brings a sweet rationality that is both much needed and overmatched.  Also delightful to see Genevieve Bujold, whose smooth performance is so assured it almost makes this absurd environment seem believable.  Freddie Prinze Jr. and Josh Hamilton struggle with two-dimensional roles.The film suffers from ""Glengarry Glen Ross Syndrome,"" it's based on a play, (Wendy MacLeod), action (such as it is) occurs in one setting, and it's entirely dialogue-driven.  But in Glengarry Glen Ross you had memorable characters, an interesting situation, spellbinding dialogue, and Mamet did the film adaptation.  In THOY you have cardboard characters, ridiculous situations, dialogue that ricochets between witty and ploddingly pompous, and director Mark Waters did the screen adaptation.  To see how a great play becomes a great movie, get Sleuth or Deathrap.",3,House Of Cards,1161216000,"10 19, 2006",2006,2285,"['House', 'Yes', 'horrible', 'title', 'bizarre', 'dark', 'comedy', 'much', 'like', 'dislike', 'ultimately', 'interminable', 'one-gadget', 'shaggy', 'dog', 'story.The', 'plot', 'loopy', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'one', 'thing', 'dumb', 'Why', 'criminal', 'insanity', 'society', 'elite', 'somehow', 'reasonable', 'audiences', 'shabby', 'construction', 'wealthy', 'oddly', 'detached', 'widow', 'raised', 'twins', 'one', 'male', 'one', 'female', 'dimwitted', 'half-brother', 'elegant', 'stately', 'home', 'woman', 'unapologetically', 'vague', 'fathers', 'children', 'say', 'were', 'definitely', 'not', 'late', 'husband', 'twins', 'are', 'inappropriately', 'close', 'even', 'twins', 'girl', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'killed', 'father', 'obsession', 'Jackie-O', 'boy', 'twin', 'attempting', 'flee', 'unholy', 'dynamic', 'brought', 'fiancee', 'meet', 'family', 'girl', 'twin', 'pathologically', 'threatened', 'causing', 'insanity', 'kick', 'up', 'few', 'notches.This', 'synopsis', 'may', 'sound', 'far-fetched', 'barely', 'surface', 'Happily', 'are', 'splendid', 'performances', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'downright', 'brilliant', 'Jackie-O', 'extreme', 'part', 'might', 'easily', 'have', 'overdone', 'Posey', 'many', 'best', 'lines', 'delivers', 'chilling', 'combination', 'intelligence', 'madness', 'malice', 'terror.Tori', 'Spelling', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'outsider', 'who', 'unsafe', 'horrific', 'world', 'adroitly', 'sweet', 'rationality', 'much', 'needed', 'overmatched', 'Also', 'delightful', 'see', 'Genevieve', 'Bujold', 'smooth', 'performance', 'so', 'assured', 'almost', 'absurd', 'environment', 'seem', 'believable', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'Josh', 'Hamilton', 'struggle', 'two-dimensional', 'roles.The', 'film', 'suffers', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'Syndrome', 'based', 'play', 'Wendy', 'MacLeod', 'action', 'such', 'one', 'setting', 'entirely', 'dialogue-driven', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'had', 'memorable', 'characters', 'interesting', 'situation', 'spellbinding', 'dialogue', 'Mamet', 'did', 'film', 'adaptation', 'THOY', 'have', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'ridiculous', 'situations', 'dialogue', 'witty', 'ploddingly', 'pompous', 'director', 'Mark', 'Waters', 'did', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'see', 'how', 'great', 'play', 'great', 'movie', 'get', 'Sleuth', 'Deathrap']",House of Yes VHS

Let's see... well, I guess I like this film because it's unique, and there is a lot of very very good dialuoge. Dialouge. Dialog. That was wise.  ;)  Yeah well, it would help if I could spell or if this box had a spell check. Hehe. Not a comb, a brush!  A brush you brush your hair with!  Anyway where was I... Oh yeah! House of yes. I have seen this movie a zillion times and never get sick of it.  Pretend he's not my brother, I do.  :)  [you have to be able to see past the incest-theme throughout the movie]  And although I do not condone the use of Tori Spelling in movies (I have no doubt her Daddy was the only reason she got this role), I have made an exception for this fine film.  I guess now on her resume, she can put that she was the Doughnut Queen in House Of Yes.  Haha.  So if you enjoy black comedies, plays, Parker Posey, good DIALOGUE (see, I can spell after all! I had a short memory lapse there...it is 17 minutes (and exactly 37 seconds) after 4am right now you know...give me a break!).

Posey's brother brings home his fiance, played by Tori Spelling, to meet his mother and twin sister, played by Posey. He has not been home for years, and his mother nurtures the unnatural, sexual relationship between brother and sister. Posey instantly dislikes Tori so much that she goes out of her way to berate, insult, and undermine her at every turn without her brother interceding  and all against the background of a dark, stormy night (a cliched movie theme). Worse comes to worse and the movie descends down hill. Don't waste your money. Save it for &quot;Party Girl&quot; or the independent drama, &quot;Clockwatchers,&quot; if you are a Parker Posey fan.

Mork ""Paranoia is Underrated""","[7, 9]","Every once in awhile a cast comes together which actually does justice to what was already a wonderfully comedie noir script. The House of Yes is exactly that movie.To overly simplify the plotline, there once were two twins. They had a sexual (read: incestual) relationship. One decided to be normal and left for the big city. He came out closer to normal. The other decided to stay behind. She went crazy. Their younger brother is none-too-bright. Their mother doesn't know if all her children are from the same man.When the male twin returns home with his new fiancee for Thanksgiving, everything falls apart. Oh, did I mention they have an obsession with the Kennedy's?This is not a Sinbad-style gag movie. This is a dark, funny movie. The casting was perfect. Parker Posey portrays perfectly (absent alliteration) a semi-psychotic woman who evinces both lunacy and feline lethality. Josh Hamilton is all the more disturbing for the degree of normalcy he brings to the role of Marty. Freddie Prinze Jr. plays the part he was born to: a half-witted simpleton. Tori Spelling plays the part SHE was born to: a half-witted simpleton who is actually more clueless than Freddie. Genevieve Bujold tops it all off with her disinterested matriarch character who -- after examing the situation -- casually notes that ''Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to baste the turkey and hide the kitchen knives.''I leave you with two sets of quotes that should give you a taste for the dialoge, and let me state for the record that there is not one word in this film that doesn't have a joke or hidden subtext to it.

We hope against hope that our relatives will somehow be on their best behavior  and that we'll all survive the weekend, which we inevitably do.Of  course, when your family is as odd as that depicted in &quot;The House of  Yes&quot;, a feeling of dread is well-founded.When your mother reminds  people of Morticia Addams, throwing out horrid family secrets along with  tips on how to properly make muffins, or your brother wants to settle  adolescent scores by making a pass at your girlfriend, or (best yet) your  twin sister (with whom you engaged in a not-so-youthful indiscretion)  thinks she's Jackie Kennedy circa 1963, the whole enterprise of a holiday  weekend is a risky undertaking at best.Tori Spelling seeks indie cred  here as the erstwhile fiance, all peaches-and-cream innocence slapped up  against the most dysfunctional family caught on film since the Rose Garden  tapes of the Clintons.  Josh Hamilton and Mark Waters play the brothers who  can't seem to let the past remain in the past, while Parker Posey radiates  as the lunatic sister who doesn't even realize the past IS the past.This is black comedy par excellance, although the subject matter may  make those few raised in a Cleaveresque household squeamish.

436988,A3GTH1VXNRYZS5,6304826168,"""j_james""","[2, 2]","Reading through many of these reviews, I think there's been a tendency to take an extreme. Some have said it was simply brilliant, others have said it was terrifically horrible. I don't think either should be said.First off, it's true that this film takes you to the very boundaries of decency, and then actually beyond those boundaries. And some of it may well be done in poor taste, but the taboo and the Kennedy scenes shouldn't destory one's opinion of this flick. The House of Yes really requires the viewer to suspend preconcieved notions of incest and JFK for a couple hours and just view it for what it is. It's not making a statement about JFK, and it isn't really taking a side regarding incest either. To let these controversial topics influence our opinion of this film is to judge the work on something it isn't. That's hardly fair.What is this movie? It's an inspection of all of the different characters. It looks at how incest, distant parenting, mental illness, a new, somewhat covered up love affair affects a family unit as a unit as well as as individuals. It is on these themes that the movie should be judged. That isn't to say the film is without problems; it has plently. Many of the themes are under-examined and underdeveloped. The screenwriting (while quite witty) is choppy and contrived at times. The audio track doesn't add to the film. And the lighting isn't very inventive.But with all of that said, there are a lot of positives as well. The acting, by all of the performers, is spectacular. That includes Prinze Jr and Spelling, neither of whom I typically enjoy. The actors seem to feel their characters and perform their roles exceptionally. Especially Posey and her mother, who literally seem to BE their characters. There are, in fact, many terrific, quotable lines, at least one delivered by all of the actors.Ultimately, what I'm saying is to judge this film for what it is, not what it isn't. What it is is an average independent film with some very compelling performances.

436990,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6304826168,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 9]","The credits of &quot;The House of Yes&quot; take us back and forth from black & white film of Jackie Kennedy giving her famous televised tour of the White House and color home movies of a young girl (Rachel Leigh Cook) dressed like Jackie and providing a similar tour of her own home. We quickly learn that the night JFK was shot, the father of the young girl and her unseen twin brother behind the camera, disappeared. In the present the young girl, known as Jackie-O (Parker Posey) has recently returned from a mental institution and is excited that her twin brother Marty (Josh Hamilton) is returning home for Thanksgiving in 1983. Unfortunately Marty has brought home a fianc?, Lesly (Tori Spelling), and this does nothing good for Jackie-O's sanity. All her mother (Genevi?ve Bujold) can do is &quot;baste the turkey and hide the kitchen knives.&quot;The problem is that Jackie and Marty are very close twins. Their mother explains to Lesly that that when they emerged from the womb Jackie was holding on to Marty's penis and as this film develops we learn she still has a rather unhealthy attachment to both it and him. Throw into the mix another brother, Anthony (Freddie Prinze Jr.) who takes a liking to Lesly and there is just no end to how badly this Thanksgiving can go. At one point Anthony explains to Lesly that she is the first guest ever to spend the night in the house, which should be enough to send her fleeing from the Pascual residence, but that comes later.The Pascuals are one of those unhappy families that is unhappy in a peculiarly sick little way. The opening credits inform us that &quot;The House of Yes&quot; was based on a play by Wendy MacLeod and as soon as the dialogue begins you certainly hear the staginess of the words. But it makes sense to me that this story of twins obsessed with incest and the Kennedy assassination was originally a play, because the black comedy probably worked even better in that context. The humor here is warped, to say the least, but the cast is in fine former and makes it easier for us to laugh.Posey is the star of the show (her performance received special recognition for acting at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival), gleefully enjoying Jackie-O's insanity, starting with her frantic response to Marty's introduction of Lesly as his fianc?. The only one who can go toe to toe with her is Marty, which probably explains why he is so important to her. It is why he continues to act out the JFK assassination with her and get physical that remains a mystery. Prinze turns in a performance that makes me think of a mellower Anthony Perkins, while Bujold keeps urging everybody to just jump ahead to the obvious ending, where Lesly goes away so that Marty and Jackie-O can apparently live happily ever after. Even the casting of Spelling works in this case, although undoubtedly a big surprise to the many who cast aspirations on her acting career.&quot;The House of Yes&quot; will not be to everyone's taste, but that is what happens when you combine incest and the Kennedy assassination. The situation is surreal enough that you do not take it seriously, but you can still understand why some people are going to give up on this one early on or not even start it once they know what it is about. As a play I would have associated this with some of those I saw during the 1970s, which is why I am probably open to this sort of storyline: I have seen stranger and weirder things. But if you watch &quot;The House of Yes&quot; what you are going to remember in the end are the performances and not the plot.",4,Time to hide the kitchen knives and hope for the best,1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,3571,"['credits', 'quot', 'House', 'Yes', 'quot', 'take', 'back', 'forth', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'Jackie', 'Kennedy', 'giving', 'famous', 'televised', 'tour', 'White', 'House', 'color', 'home', 'movies', 'young', 'girl', 'Rachel', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'dressed', 'Jackie', 'providing', 'similar', 'tour', 'own', 'home', 'quickly', 'learn', 'night', 'JFK', 'was', 'shot', 'father', 'young', 'girl', 'unseen', 'twin', 'brother', 'camera', 'disappeared', 'present', 'young', 'girl', 'known', 'Jackie-O', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'recently', 'returned', 'mental', 'institution', 'excited', 'twin', 'brother', 'Marty', 'Josh', 'Hamilton', 'returning', 'home', 'Thanksgiving', '1983', 'Unfortunately', 'Marty', 'brought', 'home', 'fianc', 'Lesly', 'Tori', 'Spelling', 'nothing', 'good', 'Jackie-O', 'sanity', 'mother', 'Genevi', 've', 'Bujold', 'can', 'do', 'quot', 'turkey', 'hide', 'kitchen', 'knives.', 'quot', 'problem', 'Jackie', 'Marty', 'are', 'very', 'close', 'twins', 'mother', 'Lesly', 'when', 'emerged', 'womb', 'Jackie', 'was', 'holding', 'Marty', 'penis', 'film', 'learn', 'still', 'rather', 'unhealthy', 'attachment', 'Throw', 'mix', 'brother', 'Anthony', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'who', 'liking', 'Lesly', 'just', 'end', 'how', 'badly', 'Thanksgiving', 'can', 'go', 'one', 'point', 'Anthony', 'Lesly', 'first', 'guest', 'ever', 'spend', 'night', 'house', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'send', 'fleeing', 'Pascual', 'residence', 'later.The', 'Pascuals', 'are', 'one', 'unhappy', 'families', 'unhappy', 'peculiarly', 'sick', 'little', 'way', 'opening', 'credits', 'inform', 'quot', 'House', 'Yes', 'quot', 'was', 'based', 'play', 'Wendy', 'MacLeod', 'as', 'soon', 'dialogue', 'certainly', 'hear', 'staginess', 'words', 'sense', 'story', 'twins', 'obsessed', 'incest', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'was', 'originally', 'play', 'black', 'comedy', 'probably', 'worked', 'even', 'better', 'context', 'humor', 'here', 'warped', 'say', 'least', 'cast', 'fine', 'former', 'easier', 'laugh.Posey', 'star', 'show', 'performance', 'received', 'special', 'recognition', 'acting', '1997', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'gleefully', 'enjoying', 'Jackie-O', 'insanity', 'starting', 'frantic', 'response', 'Marty', 'introduction', 'Lesly', 'fianc', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'go', 'toe', 'toe', 'Marty', 'probably', 'why', 'so', 'important', 'why', 'act', 'out', 'JFK', 'assassination', 'get', 'physical', 'mystery', 'Prinze', 'performance', 'think', 'mellower', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'Bujold', 'urging', 'everybody', 'just', 'jump', 'ahead', 'obvious', 'ending', 'where', 'Lesly', 'away', 'so', 'Marty', 'Jackie-O', 'can', 'apparently', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'Even', 'casting', 'Spelling', 'works', 'case', 'undoubtedly', 'big', 'surprise', 'many', 'who', 'cast', 'aspirations', 'acting', 'career.', 'quot', 'House', 'Yes', 'quot', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'taste', 'what', 'when', 'combine', 'incest', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'situation', 'surreal', 'enough', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'seriously', 'can', 'still', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'give', 'up', 'one', 'early', 'not', 'even', 'start', 'once', 'know', 'what', 'about', 'play', 'would', 'have', 'associated', 'saw', '1970s', 'why', 'am', 'probably', 'open', 'sort', 'storyline', 'have', 'seen', 'stranger', 'weirder', 'things', 'watch', 'quot', 'House', 'Yes', 'quot', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'remember', 'end', 'are', 'performances', 'not', 'plot']",House of Yes VHS

Set during part of Thanksgiving weekend, Marty is bringing his fianc&eacute; Lesly (Tori Spelling) to meet his family.  Anthony is a social shut-in of some sort...he's a young man who ought to be in college or something, but he appears to be terribly nave and flighty.  Jackie-O (her real name is not given, from what I could hear) is nuts.  She dresses like Jackie-O and virtually imagines herself to BE Jackie, and she further imagines that her brother Marty is John.  She CLEARLY has an unhealthy attachment not only to her fantasies but to her brother.  Could there be incest in their past?  Marty seems to be fairly normal, but he slips into old, poorly adjusted patterns pretty quickly.  Poor Lesly is just a mid-western girl, slightly simple...and is quickly overwhelmed by the weirdness around her.  And Mother (also not named) is no help at all...she acts like the matriarch of a fine, tradition-steeped family, having rationalized the fact that all her kids are basket cases.The film is sometimes called a comedy...but truthfully, it is more odd & quirky than funny.  At first, the odd behavior of this family seems almost quaint and amusing...but as it becomes clearer that they are ALL messed up (including ""normal"" Marty); it grows harder to keep much interest in these folks.  They are given to histrionics and huge theatricality of speech and gesture...and this is REALLY annoying to watch.The script includes bad behavior, seductions that are quite sordid, lots of yelling & drinking and enormous amounts of dialogue that indicates how nuts these people are.  It's almost as if they are all aware they are crazy and are trying to outdo each other.This might be tolerable if the cast were better.  But just as the script hasn't been allowed to open this story up (we never really even see the outside of the house)...the actors have apparently been encouraged to perform as though they were onstage.  All are allowed to exaggerate greatly, and most do not have the skill to pull this off.  If you've ever wanted to know what an evening at the theatre starring Tori Spelling and Freddie Prinze Jr. might be like...wonder no more.  It's an evening that includes not one single believable emotional moment.  Spelling acts like a dumb blonde...in the worst possible way.  Prinze just looks like a lost puppy.  Hamilton starts out okay, but as his character falls under the old thrall of his family, he allows himself to wallow in ""Acting"" with a capital ""A.""  Bujold, in many ways, comes off the best...but her character really goes through no growth or change, so in the end, her role is mostly relegated to the sidelines.  And the usually wonderful Parker Posey is allowed to go right over the top.  She's got energy to burn, and her role gives her very little in the way of realistic shadings.  She bounces all over the place (per the script), and none of it seems rooted in an underlying reality.  I can't decide if it is her fault or the fault of the director & script.  Regardless, she flails about with great verve...but it's all sound and fury signifying nothing.By the time HOUSE OF YES reaches its final scenes, we're just tired and bored and ready for it to be over.  I was left feeling that I had spent nearly two hours with a bunch of horrible people, doing stupid, petty little things and that it all culminated in total meaninglessness.  There was no deeper point to be made, and even the journey there was not worth taking.

The House of Yes will go down in history and Parker Posey deserves to be  forever known as the Queen of the Indies for this highly creative piece of  work.It's Thanksgiving 1983 in a wealthy suburb of Washington D.C. and  the Pascal family, an affluent French-American family is preparing for the  traditional festivities. The problem is that nothing is carried out  according to tradition in this house or within the dysfunctional family  which it houses. Mommy Pascal isn't sure of the paternity of any of her  children, or what quite happened to her late husband. The boys are, well,  boys, and the daughter in the family has a rather malicious mean streak to  her, despite being a gracious hostess. She's also under the impression that  she and her twin brother are destined to share absolutely everything in  life (everything!) and is so fixated with the Kennedy family that she is  affectionately known in the Family as Jackie-O, a fantasy that she carries  out disturbingly flawlessly, thanks to a collection of Oleg Cassini in her  wardrobe, pearls and hair that would've made Mrs. O. herself a little  envious. She is also so psychotically funny that you cannot help but to  start quoting her once the lights go up and the credits come down. She also  does a top-notch of dealing with the fiancee of the man she loves...her own  twin brother.I've heard this film compared to Heathers a couple of  times; admirers of Heathers and its dark humour shouldn't hesitate to see  this film, but neither should anyone else who loves smart, witty,  sophisticated yet irreverent comedy!",5,&quot;Take it from one who knows...&quot;,957312000,"05 3, 2000",2000,1726,"['Never', 'life', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'so', 'full', 'memorable', 'one', 'liners', 'highest', 'high-camp', 'dialogue', 'biting', 'humour', 'darkest', 'comedy', 'House', 'Yes', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'be', 'forever', 'known', 'Queen', 'Indies', 'highly', 'creative', 'piece', 'work.It', 'Thanksgiving', '1983', 'wealthy', 'suburb', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Pascal', 'family', 'affluent', 'French-American', 'family', 'preparing', 'traditional', 'festivities', 'problem', 'nothing', 'carried', 'according', 'tradition', 'house', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'houses', 'Mommy', 'Pascal', ""n't"", 'sure', 'paternity', 'children', 'what', 'quite', 'happened', 'late', 'husband', 'boys', 'are', 'well', 'boys', 'daughter', 'family', 'rather', 'malicious', 'mean', 'streak', 'being', 'gracious', 'hostess', 'also', 'impression', 'twin', 'brother', 'are', 'destined', 'share', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'life', 'everything', 'so', 'fixated', 'Kennedy', 'family', 'affectionately', 'known', 'Family', 'Jackie-O', 'fantasy', 'out', 'disturbingly', 'flawlessly', 'thanks', 'collection', 'Oleg', 'Cassini', 'wardrobe', 'pearls', 'hair', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'Mrs.', 'O.', 'little', 'envious', 'also', 'so', 'psychotically', 'funny', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'start', 'quoting', 'once', 'lights', 'go', 'up', 'credits', 'come', 'down', 'also', 'top-notch', 'dealing', 'fiancee', 'man', 'own', 'twin', 'brother.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'film', 'compared', 'Heathers', 'couple', 'times', 'admirers', 'Heathers', 'dark', 'humour', 'should', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'see', 'film', 'should', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'smart', 'witty', 'sophisticated', 'yet', 'irreverent', 'comedy']",House of Yes VHS

There were quite a few awkward chuckling moments, but a ton of hilarious, quick-witted dialog delivered extremely well by the actors involved.

I haven't seen/read the play, so I can't comment on how closely it matched or if it was what I expected, but I do want to see it performed now!!Parker Posey does an amazing job as ""Jackie-O"" in this movie - it would have been pretty easy to be drastically over-the-top in this role, but Posey goes just over-the-top enough to play the role to a T.
