The personalities chosen to represent the astronauts would have been better suited representing shoe salespeople (sorry shoe salespeople - it's a good job, just not astronaut ready). The dialogue was unbelievable; the storyline seemed more made up for daytime TV drama; the spacecraft and Mars sets were way to cheap for today's standards.The every-so-often instructional monologue was fit for grade school and seemed forced and out-of-place.

What no longer exists is the political will to do so.When I was a teenager growing up in the 1960s most everyone was ""space happy"".  We all assumed permanent bases on the moon and a manned landing on Mars within 10 years.Today we have no U.S. manned space program, no way for us to get into space.  Sure, decades from now there MAY be a robust private space-travel industry. But that is a long time. In the interim, space will be owned by Russia and China.When John F. Kennedy pledged to go to the moon, he meant it. He had an intense personal commitment to the enterprise. He delivered speeches remembered to this day. He dedicated astronomical sums to make it happen.What should our space program be like?
