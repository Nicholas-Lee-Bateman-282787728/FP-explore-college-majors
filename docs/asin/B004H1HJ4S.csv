That being said, I liked this movie much better than the last one they released.  I felt that the conversations were overall less rude than those in Fashion Fairytale, which I appreciated as my daughter tends to want to emulate the behavior of her favorite movie characters.  I also really liked the themes of forgiveness and working out misunderstandings with others. The past three movies have had themes that I felt showed materialism and celebrity in an overly positive light and that is a concern to me.  However, I do feel that this movie was definitely an improvement over A Fashion Fairytale.  While I sincerely hope the producers of these movies decide to produce more movies not set in modern times, this movie is worth purchasing for your daughter if she is a Barbie fan.",4,Better than fashion fairytale...,1301356800,"03 29, 2011",2011,924,"['agree', 'reviewer', 'older', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'ones', 'are', 'not', 'set', 'modern', 'times', 'are', 'more', 'appealing', 'daughter', 'being', 'said', 'liked', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'last', 'one', 'released', 'felt', 'conversations', 'were', 'overall', 'less', 'rude', 'Fashion', 'Fairytale', 'appreciated', 'daughter', 'want', 'emulate', 'behavior', 'favorite', 'movie', 'characters', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'themes', 'forgiveness', 'working', 'out', 'misunderstandings', 'others', 'past', 'three', 'movies', 'have', 'had', 'themes', 'felt', 'showed', 'materialism', 'celebrity', 'overly', 'positive', 'light', 'concern', 'However', 'do', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'improvement', 'Fashion', 'Fairytale', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'producers', 'movies', 'decide', 'produce', 'more', 'movies', 'not', 'set', 'modern', 'times', 'movie', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'daughter', 'Barbie', 'fan']",N/A

They go and make a SEQUEL to it with even more shallowness, product marketing, fashion brands and guess what else?! Even more fashion! With BUYING wings to make yourself a fairy!I was APPAULED with the Fashion Fairytale film and was hoping this would be a bit better, but no, it's just as shallow and 'plastic' like the last film.The 'Fairy' idea was ridiculous. I don't know why they are putting fairies into these new Barbie films, they are just annoying and catty and guess what? Go shop at brand names! And just seem to have nasty natures.There was so much wrong with this film. It was overall a mess with nothing at all likable about it at all.The real definition of a Barbie fairy is Elena, with a kind, caring and strong spirit.I grew up with the original Barbie films which I felt inspired by and which I felt made me a better person and taught me a good lesson. I'm an adult now and I'm upset at Barbie's new pathway of appearances, boyfriends and nothing inspiring young girls. I felt as if the films went terribly downhill right at the Mermaid Tale film where the whole idea of 'purchases' and 'buying' started to surface.I could totally tolerate Barbie's new plastic look and new voice if they would trash the whole superficiality of it, the annoying and catty fashion fairy idea etc and make it to do more with believing in yourself, following your heart and being brave and just showing good morals to children and making them feel inspired to be themselves and act their age.I feel overall that children are growing up too much. I've seen reviews from children as young as 6 on websites talking about sex, vampires and saying it doesn't bother them and they like it and don't mind seeing it. And also writing up things like adults and overall just seeming like adults when they aren't.Then there's the way young children dress and even have mobiles! Even speak and behave like they are much older than they are. Even are fashion conscious!

Taylor,"[13, 17]","My four-year old daughter is the Barbie fan in the house, and she was excitedly anticipating the release of this movie after seeing a preview for it on A Fashion Fairytale.  I actually loved the Merliah movie, and the Fashion Fairytale was pretty cute.  I was shocked this movie was so much less than the previous two, and it seriously underwhelmed me.  It reminded me of something put together quickly to fit a few key words, something maybe executives thought would appeal to little girls-""fairies!, Barbie!, Ken!""  The last two Barbie movies released have featured ""Barbie"" as the star of different movies, and that's how they tie it into the older Barbie movies.  Barbie only ""played"" Merliah (the mermaid in the movie before Fashion Fairytale).  Of course you aren't looking for plot and character development on a Barbie movie, but this one just shouldn't have been released.  I doubt my daughter will want to watch it again.  Her favorite parts all involved Ken.  He had some funny lines, and his tiny wings were funny when they were buzzing like a house fly.  I wasn't pleased with some of the behavior, and even though everyone makes up in the end and become friends, it seemed to forget its target audience.  The message seemed forced.

Barbie is on the red carpet with Raquelle felling she's being upstaged once again and try to ruin her dress at the movie premaire. Barbie's hair dress and make up girl have a secret. Their exile fairies.  When another fairy put her queen under a love spell to fall for Ken, he's kidnapped to Glossangeles to marry her. The two exile fairies feel they have no choice but to reveal their secret to Raquelle and Barbie who take off to Barbie through a fairy portal to get a love potion antidote from one of Barbie's fashion friends.  The girls rush to the fairy realm where we see a few familiar faces I think as some of the characters from other barbie movies might be re-used here.  Ken is fighting a duel with male fairy in love with the princess and the girls and Ken must work together as true friends if they wish to rescue Ken from marriage and escape the princess' magical prison.

Anyway's I really enjoyed this movie but did feel as though it was somewhat rushed & a combination of the some the other barbie movie's mixed all in one.But overall very entertaining & enjoyable.  I thought the movie was pretty cool the music video was pretty decent too.  The movie had alot to do with fairies & secrets besides from that I'm not saying anymore you'll have to watch the movie to see everything but defently worth watching.Overall I'd recommend this barbie movie to anyone know matter what age there are.

Not in Fairy Secret...its one...Can you Keep a Secret...played at the beginning and very end credits.  Its nothing exciting even.  This movie was enjoyed by my daughters who are 2 and 6 b/c they love anything Barbie and anything Fairy...but I highly doubt we will watch this one over and over again like the older classic Barbie movies.  It is definitely not a must own movie to watch over and over.  I don't have any specific complaints other than the lack of cool songs.  It almost seemed like a continuation from the last movie...like Fashion Fairytale part 2.  And the next one that they showed a preview for out in fall 2011 doesn't look that appealing either...something like Barbie Princess Charm School...where I can see they changed the face of Barbie again..which may be a better thing, but still..PICK A FACE already!  The ending of this one was kinda lame, they all woke up and had the same dream...not really what we were expecting.  It was like Barbie and her friends weren't trustworthy enough to keep the secret, they had to think they dreamt it.  I really wish Mattel would honestly take a look at the petition signed about the last Barbie movie and change of voice and rethink this and their new ""format"" of movies.  They are not classic and very forgettable.  They also need to rethink their target audience...just b/c you make a cartoon about fashion and use cool and hip words does not mean pre teens or teens will watch this movie, the target age for all the Barbie fans I know are younger than 10.
