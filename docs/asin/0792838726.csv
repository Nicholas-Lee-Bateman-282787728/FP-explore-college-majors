141487,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0792838726,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[5, 11]","Foxes is a coming of age drama about four teenage girls growing up in the San Fernando Valley near Los Angeles. It attempts to be a gritty behind the scenes look at the sex, drugs, and rock and roll of teenagers in the late 70's, but it comes off more akin to another force feeding of aerosol cheese by director Adrian Lyne. Jodie Foster is like the den mother of the Foxes in question, and while she is always interesting in whatever role she is playing, this is a tremendous waste of her talents. She tries to manage the situations and solve all the problems of her three friends, but it is beyond her capability. While she seeks to control the personal lives of her friends, who they date, and so forth, what of her own love life?The closest she comes to a love interest of her own is Brad, who is almost like a mascot for the Foxes. He is too cute and short to be taken seriously by Annie (Cherie Currie from the all girl rock group The Runaways). He is also too cute to be taken seriously by the audience. The whole time he is onscreen you are thinking, Happy Days, Joanie Loves Chachi, and Charles in Charge. Mostly though you are thinking, what is Chachi doing in this movie that purports to be a gritty behind the scenes look at the secret lives of teenage girls?Cherie Currie, as the stoner girl that Jeannie (Jodie Foster) is always trying to rescue, either from bad boys who get her drugged up for date rape, or from her psycho cop father, is a disappointment as an actress. You'd think that a rock star from the legendary rock band The Runaways would have some stage presence, but sadly she is totally lacking in charisma. It is so hard to be sympathetic for such a shallow, stupid, and doomed character. They should have picked Joan Jett, if they needed someone from The Runaways so badly. Even Lita Ford, judging by her subsequent musical career, would have been a better choice.Another bad choice: Angel, the rock band, really added little to the film. Were they supposed to show the total lack of creativity and inspiration the youth of 1980 had to draw on? If so, maybe it was a great choice. I don't remember Angel at all, and judging by what I saw in Foxes, I am grateful for the memory lapse. Speaking of bad musical choices, though, they chose a couple of songs that were totally inappropriate, just really bland pop music that didn't seem to have anything whatsover to do with anything that was even happening in the film. It was as if they owed some songwriter a favor. Was it The Beckmeier Brothers? There were some tunes by Angel that were lame, and lots of stuff by Giorgio Moroder. The only song that worked at all, and then only for a bit of late 70's nostalgia, was ""More Than a Feeling"" by Boston.Finally, they slap in a totally gratuitous car/skateboard chase, and a totally contrived ending. This was a very ill conceived project. The only reason to watch it is if you are totally obsessed with Jodie Foster, like Hinckley, or if you just want to confirm what a rotten director Adrian Lyne is, has been, and will always be. Foxes is one of his early efforts and also one of his worst. A far better use of your time would be to watchValley Girl, which doesn't aspire to be any more than a light hearted comedy, but is vastly more entertaining; and has a great soundtrack featuring The Plimsouls (who perform a song live), Josie Cotton, The Psychedelic Furs, Sparks, and Modern English. Plus, you get Nicolas Cage as a Hollywood (the actual city, not as in Tinsel Town) punk rocker.FILMS DIRECTED BY ADRIAN LYNNEFatal Attraction (Special Collector's Edition)(1987)9 1/2 Weeks(1986)Flashdance(1983)FILMS AND ROLES OF JODIE FOSTERNell(1994) ....

Hartley,"[28, 29]","Aside from the patented soft-focus look and one ""creepy old uncle"" closeup tracking shot of sleeping teenage girls (under the opening credits) this early effort from director Adrian Lyne actually gives us substance over style for a change. With its pop soundtrack and teen angst themes, 1979's ""Foxes"" could have been dismissed at the time as an estrogen-rich flipside of ""Saturday Night Fever"". In hindsight, ""Foxes"" seems ahead of its time, presaging ""Less Than Zero"", ""Kids"" and ""The Virgin Suicides"". Jodie Foster leads a fine cast in this episodic tale of four L.A. girl pals dealing with growing pains at the height of the Sex Drugs & Rock&Roll Era. In this age of ""Sex In The City"" and the ""American Pie"" film franchise, you may find this hard to believe, but as a young male (at the time) I remember being shocked by the frank coversations the girls have about sex and relationships (when the boys have left the room!). Good performances all around, with ""non actor"" Cherie Currie (best known as lead singer of proto-grrrl band The Runaways) actually giving the most believable performance as a troubled druggie. Sally Kellerman (as Foster's mother) has some memorable scenes, and there is a notable cameo from Adam Faith (whom we sadly lost in 2003) as Foster's father.

141494,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,0792838726,Gregor von Kallahann,"[9, 16]","There is a democratic school of film criticism which pretty much holds that a film is ""artisically successful"" if it speaks to its audience.  Judging from the commentary I've seen posted on this film (on Amazon.com and elsewhere), I would have to say that Adrian Lyne's 1980 film FOXES has certainly found its audience.  And judging from the abundance of five star reviews, it's clear that it ""speaks"" to them.The problem with that ""democratic approach"" for me, however, is that while viewers may connect to a film that addresses issues near and dear to THEM, it is also true that a.) a better film might speak to them even more, and b.) there may have actually been a better version of the film in question, lying on the cutting room floor.  With FOXES, this would seem to very likely be the case.Those who came of age in the 70s or early 80s (particularly if they were from metropolitan areas) will likely identify with these high school friends who seem jaded beyond their years, simply because they've SEEN it all, even when it's the case that they haven't DONE it all themselves.  (The big complaint of one of the ""foxes"" is that she's still a virgin--at least until about half way through the movie, when she's deflowered by a 20-something Randy Quaid of all people.)  But unlike those of us a decade or so older, they don't get to benefit from a 60's style idealism.  If anything, it's de rigueur for these girls to sneer at hippie-style notions of some of their parents.  It's helpful to keep in mind that this film is from the era when the word ""groovy"" became used only in an ironic sense.Would that the film actually explored the significance of what it meant to be 17 even as the ""Me Decade"" was drawing to a close.  Unfortunately, the film is just too choppy, and in spots, too contrived, to really pull it off.  In part, that's likely an editing problem (and there really WAS a better film on that proverbial cutting room floor).  But some of its problems are also conceptual.  Unlikely twists--like the chase-sequence-on-a-skateboard featuring Scott Baio outwitting a bunch of thugs--seem gratuitous.But the more significant problem is simply that of a lack of sufficient character development in a movie that cries out for it.

Following the lives of four teenage girls in Los Angeles, circa 1979, it consists of episodes tied together by the thinnest of plot lines.  Everything appears trashy, ugly and venal.  The city is run down and dilapidated.  The teenagers lead barren lives that alternate between mindless drunken brawls and bouts of despair.  The adults are scarcely better, empty, dysfunctional, older but little wiser.  All the characters are intellectually shallow.  Still, there are some powerful moments.  The dream-like soft-focus introduction contrasts the softness of the girl's bodies with the harshness of the environment they live in.

You'll notice in almost every scene she's in, she's always touching, feeling, caressing the bodies of the other performers, the boys and girls alike, she can't take their hands off them, even when she's speaking of something else.  And yet her need to feel flesh doesn't suggest sexual hunger, it seems instead related to a maternal instinct, for she's the one who's always taking acre of everyone else, even her own mother (Sally Kellerman).  The scene where Jodie Foster climbs into bed with sleepy, nerve-wracked Kellerman and reads to her out of Plato--of all philosophers!-- touches something real in all of us who have ever wondered, who is the other half of myself?  Yes, now and then Lyne crosses over the border into a realm of David Bailey bad taste, especially in the opening credit sequence that so lovingly explores the bodies of the four sleeping ""foxes"" who are having a sleepover.  It might almost be an erotic thriller from SHOWTIME.  However, that's what happens when you experiment, you risk bad taste, and I'd rather have a picture that was all bad taste as long as it was doing something unique.  And most of the time the photography serves the characters well, showing the weakness as well as the strength, the maturity as well as the traces of childishness on the faces of all his young stars.Scott Baio never changes expression in the movie, but we feel we know his thoughts anyhow and can feel what he's thinking in every scene.  Part of this is to the credit of an exceptionally literate screenplay.  People always brag on about, oh, I don't know, Peter Greenaway, but he's done nothing as good as FOXES.  Maybe it's the title, but FOXES doesn't get much credit, does it?  Jodie Foster should have gotten the Oscar for this movie, she does better work here than in either of the films for which she actually won Academy Awards.  And Cherie Currie is fantastic too, she actually manages to seem like she's in some documentary about her own life, fragile, endangered, willful, ultimately inexplicable like all human beings.And the whole milieu of an as yet ungentrified LA feels lived in, like an Altman landscape.

However whilst Lyne's later titles had ideas that captured the public imagination, with themes of crime and punishment circa Cecil B DeMille, this first film suffers from a screenplay that goes nowhere, and interminable pacing. This take on teenagers in LA having a superior moral code to their parents is highlighted by Sally Kellerman describing her daughter Jodie Foster and her friends as &quot;short 40 year olds, who look like kids but don't act like 'em&quot;. The tale centres on Foster's friendship with 3 other schoolgirls and their efforts to create a &quot;family&quot; since their parents are either divorced, abusive or uncast. The group focuses on the drug-taking habits of the most put-upon, whose fate is practically predetermined by the TV movie standards of the narrative. As the natural leader of the group, presumably because she has more acting experience, this is one of Foster's last child roles before she temporarily abandoned Hollywood for Yale and John Hinkley. It's indicative of Lyne's seeming indifference to his performers that he can even make Jodie Foster look bad, though she does yell back well at Kellerman. Kellerman herself is one of the mean adult figures, possibly given even worse material than a thuggish policeman father, and it's a miracle that Lois Smith as another parent manages to invest some character in her brief appearance. The idea of casting Jodie Foster and Sally Kellerman as mother and daughter is probably Lyne's most provocative contribution. Lyne came to work in the USA with a group of British directors who all graduated into film making via advertising, and he does present some early amusing observations of Hollywood oddball streetlife. This is about the only time the screenplay comes up with anything approaching wit - with the girls referring to a woman they see as weird - Mary Weirdo - then sing the Merry Widow waltz; and one line about a pimp &quot;He could hypnotise you like a cobra and the next thing you're out on the boulevard dressed like the Pointer Sisters&quot;.

Foster is heartbroken over her parents' split and feels things more intensely than her buds - though it's possible it just seems that way because she's the only one of the four Foxes who can act. Speaking about Foster's former beau, Robert Romanus, Kagan opines, ""He sure has changed since he got the van,"" but Foster looks deeper, offering, ""He's changed since he got the hair-blower.""So we'll know that these Valley foxes are misunderstood by their folks, moments before Kagan gives a big party, her mother Lois Smith goes bonkers upon hearing that kids prefer scotch to beer. ""Maybe Dad and I should go out of town tonight,"" Smith rages. ""Everybody could get real drunk on scotch and have a real sexual time. Your friends, they're all having affairs in junior high school! Dad and I... we experimented. But I always wished that we'd waited."" Humiliated, Kagan cries, ""You don't understand, I have waited. I'm a virgin!"" The shame is too great for Kagan to bear, so she collapses, and her kid sister tells the arriving guests, ""Party's off. She's grounded - she's a virgin!""Kagan then embarks on an affair with older man Randy Quaid, primarily so that the gals can throw a wild party in his bachelor pad. Not surprisingly, the bash soon turns violent - the teens are apparently driven nuts (as you may be too) by hearing Donna Summer sing the Foxes theme, ""On the Radio,"" over and over again. Everyone gets busted by the cops, which is bad news for Currie - her abusive pa is a cop who has her committed - but worse news for Foster, who must listen as her mom, Sally Kellerman, launches into one of the all-time Bad Actings speeches: ""I don't like your friends. Are there any nice people left in the world? Maybe the whole bunch of you is sick. You booze, you dope, you sleep with whomever. You look like kids, but you don't act like them. You're short 40 year olds - and you're tough ones."" She adds, ""Just because they fit you for a diaphragm doesn't make you a woman."" Wait, there's more: the real reason she's upset is because Foster and friends are so svelte. ""You make me hate my hips,"" Kellerman wails. ""I hate my hips!""It all ends when Currie breaks out of the institution, and Foster and pal Scott Baio rush to save her from socializing with white-trash druggies who, memorably, toss Baio into a trash bin. But it's Too Late for Currie, who thumbs a ride with drunken, married, middle-class swingers who hit on her. Currie would rather die than have sex with (shudder!) squares, and, thanks to a convenient car crash, she does.It's not Too Late for Foster, however. She is seen driving off to college in search of a better education and, presumably, better co-stars, directors and scripts.",5,SHAKE YOUR BOOTY,1186704000,"08 10, 2007",2007,3450,"['**', 'spoilers', 'ahead', '**This', 'Bad', 'Movie', 'milestone', 'late', ""'70s"", 'cinema', 'kind', 'retro', 'howler', ""'ll"", 'make', 'want', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'film', 'very', 'first', 'line', 'dialogue', 'Shake', 'booty', 'One', 'formula', 'movies', 'group', 'gals', 'livin', 'lovin', 'learnin', 'life', 'think', 'Where', 'Boys', 'Are', 'Come', 'Fly', 'Me', 'Satisfaction', 'Shag', 'Foxes', 'clique', 'San', 'Fernando', 'Valley', 'high', 'school', 'hipsters', 'who', ""'re"", 'teenage', 'dopers', 'broken', 'troubled', 'homes', 'are', 'nevertheless', 'usual', 'types', 'found', 'such', 'flicks', 'Foster', 'trampy', 'brain', 'Kandice', 'Stroh', 'trampy', 'nice', 'girl', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'trampy', 'bad', 'girl', 'Marilyn', 'Kagan', 'trampy', 'innocent.When', ""n't"", 'saying', 'things', ""'m"", 'Suzy', 'slut', 'Foster', 'heartbroken', 'parents', 'split', 'feels', 'things', 'more', 'intensely', 'buds', 'possible', 'just', 'way', 'only', 'one', 'four', 'Foxes', 'who', 'can', 'act', 'Speaking', 'Foster', 'former', 'beau', 'Robert', 'Romanus', 'Kagan', 'sure', 'changed', 'got', 'van', 'Foster', 'deeper', 'offering', 'changed', 'got', 'hair-blower', ""'ll"", 'know', 'Valley', 'foxes', 'are', 'misunderstood', 'folks', 'moments', 'Kagan', 'big', 'party', 'mother', 'Lois', 'Smith', 'bonkers', 'hearing', 'kids', 'prefer', 'scotch', 'beer', 'Maybe', 'Dad', 'should', 'go', 'town', 'tonight', 'Smith', 'rages', 'Everybody', 'could', 'get', 'real', 'drunk', 'scotch', 'have', 'real', 'sexual', 'time', 'friends', ""'re"", 'having', 'affairs', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'Dad', 'experimented', 'always', 'wished', ""'d"", 'waited', 'Humiliated', 'Kagan', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'have', 'waited', ""'m"", 'virgin', 'shame', 'too', 'great', 'Kagan', 'bear', 'kid', 'sister', 'arriving', 'guests', 'Party', 'off', 'grounded', 'virgin', 'Kagan', 'then', 'affair', 'older', 'man', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'primarily', 'gals', 'can', 'throw', 'wild', 'party', 'bachelor', 'pad', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'bash', 'soon', 'violent', 'teens', 'are', 'apparently', 'driven', 'nuts', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'hearing', 'Donna', 'Summer', 'sing', 'Foxes', 'theme', 'Radio', 'over', 'again', 'Everyone', 'busted', 'cops', 'bad', 'news', 'Currie', 'abusive', 'pa', 'cop', 'who', 'committed', 'worse', 'news', 'Foster', 'who', 'must', 'listen', 'mom', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'one', 'all-time', 'Bad', 'Actings', 'speeches', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'friends', 'Are', 'there', 'nice', 'people', 'left', 'world', 'Maybe', 'whole', 'bunch', 'sick', 'booze', 'dope', 'sleep', 'whomever', 'look', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', ""'re"", 'short', '40', 'year', 'olds', ""'re"", 'tough', 'ones', 'Just', 'fit', 'diaphragm', ""n't"", 'make', 'woman', 'Wait', 'more', 'real', 'reason', 'upset', 'Foster', 'friends', 'are', 'so', 'svelte', 'make', 'hate', 'hips', 'Kellerman', 'hate', 'hips', 'when', 'Currie', 'institution', 'Foster', 'pal', 'Scott', 'Baio', 'rush', 'save', 'socializing', 'white-trash', 'druggies', 'who', 'memorably', 'toss', 'Baio', 'trash', 'bin', 'Too', 'Late', 'Currie', 'who', 'thumbs', 'ride', 'drunken', 'married', 'middle-class', 'swingers', 'who', 'hit', 'Currie', 'would', 'rather', 'die', 'have', 'sex', 'shudder', 'thanks', 'convenient', 'car', 'crash', 'does.It', 'not', 'Too', 'Late', 'Foster', 'however', 'seen', 'driving', 'off', 'college', 'search', 'better', 'education', 'presumably', 'better', 'co-stars', 'directors', 'scripts']",Foxes VHS

Five hot teen girls in a Hard Days Night-esque sort of movie, but with way more controversial, under age sexuality. Never happened. A[...]BUT- Cherie Currie, who was arguably the hottest of the group, did make one movie in 1980, with a cast of girls that weren't quite as hot as the Runaways... (Jodie Foster etc.) called Foxes.It's your typical late seventies melodrama involoving some scattered home life stuff, and the connection between that and lots of booze bashes during those tender teenage years. Cheri Currie is the bad girl in this one, and we get what we want from her in this flick. ""I'll be damned if I have to sleep with some squares!"" she exclaims, as she's whisked away from her friends by a car full of much older dudes.Scott Baio plays Jodi Fosters friend, and this was way before he was 46 and ridiculous. He was probably about 18 and lame. But whatever. The movie exudes a rock and roll feel. Even though the only real perfomance in the movie was by the band Angel, who may have been the suckiest, lamest glam band ever. (Punky Meadows...your not a chick!)  But the movie is still enjoyable, in that seventies party animal type way that we all enjoy... a little bit of goofy dialougue thats fun to laugh at.... and Cherie Currie rocks my face around....Blllrrrrbbblllllrllrlbbbrlrl!!!!...
