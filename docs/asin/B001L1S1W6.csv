I loved what shows i saw so i decided to buy the seasons on dvd. The new adventures of old Christine is hilarious.

Regular price, 34.99, on sale 24.99.What I'd like to know is the actual cost in the making of a DVD.Season 3's episodes are well-written, well-acted and hilarious.I love Julia-Louis Dreyfus. She's one of the funniest comedians of the 21st century. A newer version of Lucille Ball.The remaining cast members are excellent actors, too.Each character does a fantastic job, well-suited to their roles, in a family-type atmosphere.I recommend buying Season 3 especially if you're a die-hard Julia/Elaine/Christine fan..Prepare youself to watch the complete season at one sitting.
