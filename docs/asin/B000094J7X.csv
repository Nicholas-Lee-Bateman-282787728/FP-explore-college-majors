751930,AOQLO5AHYBNZL,B000094J7X,AnimalLuVer,"[1, 14]","There are plenty of things to like about this movie, but my expectations for ""Lan Yu"" were several levels higher than any point this flick ever reached.I do like the ""treatment"" of the female character the older man left Lan Yu to marry -- it was easy to see why a gay man would try going straight to be with her.  Alas, the poor guy was no match for her intellect, and this was made very appparent so that without showing any scenes of their married life I knew why the relationship was doomed from the start, and it wasn't due to his being gay, but due to the fact that he wasn't as astute as was she.  I'm glad she was cast as some pathetic fag hag so desperate for the company of a man that she knowingly tried to swim upstream.  Looked more like she figured a moderately rich but dumb guy who knew he needed her interllectual skills to get them both to wealth was better than a poor man who shared her intellect but would never acquire any of the material things so appreciated by a woman with good tastes.  She would have been age-appropriate for him if not for the fact that he was an adolescent in a middle-aged man's body.  She was certainly better-looking than Lan Yu!Happily, and unlike with that loathesome ""Eban & Charlie"", things connected up well in Lan Yu, so that little things touch upon early on turned up meaning a lot by the end.  I won't be specific so you will have to enjoy watching it yourself.I was expecting a more attractive actor for Lan Yu.  Yeah, I know, you say I'm too shallow.  Well, I think if I were an older guy spending money on young bed bunnies, I'd get the prettiest ones my money could buy.  Having adjusted to his seeming penchant for the ""hardworking young student"" type, I was puzzled by his clumsy attempts to make-it with the ""young athlete"" type.  Tell you what though, I got plenty of laughs looking at the body of the guy cast in the ""young athlete"" role:  he looked ridiculous!  Like a little mini-Michelin-man!  Whenever they pick guys with big-yet-soft-and-flabby-features where there should be hard, well-defined muscles, I think the casting woman must have been using too much heroin that day.The movie was far too sterile for my liking, which is to say that it needed sex or violence to make it interesting.  On the other hand, the men weren't especially attractive, so the lack of sex is a good thing, but they should have made up for it with violence.  Show us the accident, for example.  In fact, show us such an accident early on, then later we'll already know something like that could happen.Also, I wonder if there's any benefit to showing one side of a phone conversation with a person who is inconsequential to the plot.The ending put an interesting twist on everything that preceded it, just as it should.ENJOY this movie by not having high expectations.  In fact, if you want to guarantee you will love this movie more than any other, watch it right after viewing Eban & Charlie.

The only other Chinese directed film I've watched involving a love story between two men was ""The Wedding Banquet"", which I enjoyed tremendously.  This movie, however, I bought on a whim and it payed off!  The story centers around a young architecture student who begins an affair with an older ,successful business man.  Lan Yu, the student, is wooed with dinners, money and many superficial things (none of which are important to him) but eventually has his heart broken by Hangdong, who can't commit to a relationship that he thinks will never last.  He feels that he must commit to a proper marriage with a woman, and after meeting a smart, beautiful woman that fits the bill as the perfect wife, he marries her and ends his relationship with Lan Yu.  Fate, however, brings the two men together some time later after Hangdong has divorced his wife and the two become lovers again but not before Hangdong's job and personal freedom are threatened.  Lan Yu, at this time, proves how deeply he loves Hangdong.  I won't go further into detail about what happens from there nor will I give away the ending.""Lan Yu"" is a very good movie that people, gay or straight, should see.

Someone had stolen the case cover, so I was trying to figure out what this movie might be about.  Alas, I can tell you that I didn't expect at all to see full frontal nudity of a man... in a film from China!Well, strictly speaking this is a Hong Kong production, I suppose, and I'm sure this is an underground cult in Communist China.  I can't imagine ""the butchers of Beijing"" would let this film run publicly, not only because of its homosexuality theme, but because of the backdrop of corruption among the party elite (what's the Russian word for that?) and the Tiananmen Square protests.Anyway, the movie is surprisingly good.  Some may find the story melodramatic or simple-minded.  But as a non-gay person, I find the plot very easy to follow, the emotions very easy to believe in, and the acting superb.  The actor who plays the title character is simply outstanding.  He exudes both some kind of countryside manhood and yet at the same time a lot of feminine sensitivity.  OK, seriously, I'm not gay, but I was totally drawn into the story and into the characters.  The death of Lan Yu at the end is just very, very sad.I'd always thought HK movies were cheesy, low-budget flicks aimed at pleasing the after-hour drunkards.  Now I know better.

751934,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000094J7X,Grady Harp,"[0, 0]","LAN YU is another indication that films from China are becoming increasingly more poignant, less dependent on spectacle, and certainly more daring in view of the political milieu. Director Stanley Kwan not only has courage to make this poignant film, he also has the gifts to creat an atmospheric, gentle, quiet, and luminously photographed love story.  He draws understated performances from his actors, never stooping to caricature, always respectful of the inherent delicacy of his subject matter.Lan Yu is a handsome young gay architecture student who becomes involved with Hangdong, a closeted Beijing businessman.  The affair they pursue is subtle yet not without passion, the kind of understated passion that rings true rather than playing for sensationalism.  The plot twists and turns - Lan Yu is set aside by Hangdong for a ""proper marriage"" which leads to divorce and to other losses, bringing Hangdong back to seek his real love - Lan Yu.  The change in their relationship speaks loudly for a wider acceptance of same sex love. To reveal the ending would be a disservice to the viewer.  Part of the joy of this simple story is the sensitivity of Hangdong's colleagues in responding to the his various dilemmas: there  is no ""bad guy"", no prejudice, no castigation - these friends are committed and make homophobia seem merely a foreign, unimportant word.  This film is a model of restraint and intelligent, finely crafted story telling.  The actors are uniformly excellent and win our hearts.

Director Stanley Kwan has made an intelligent film that conveys genuine emotion without theatricality. There is much that rings true in this story for gay men, or anyone, of any age. Based on an incredibly popular 'E-novel' from an anonymous author, Jimmy Ngai's screenplay strikes many true chords and, along with a well-realized mise-en-scene, creates a completely believeable world.Casting seems ideal. Thirty-something Hangdong is played with great range by Jun Hu, and he looks convincing in the part as well. Playing Lan Yu, who ages from late teens into twenties, is remarkable Ye Liu. The men meet as part of a transaction: money for sex, paid by wealthy Hangdong. The sex scenes are presented with honesty, sensuality and without ambiguity. Yet, early on, it becomes clear to both that more is going on than physicality. For a short time, they pursue a relationship. Then everything is altered by choices made by one of the men. The main part of the film, told as a memory, is the playing out of the consequences of his choice. If these characters were heterosexual, the film's plot might be dismissed as hackneyed. But with the added dynamic of male/male relations in a homophobic world and with Kwan's dream-like, often poetic directing style, we have something ultimately original and worth experiencing.The film is presented letterboxed on the DVD and it looks very good. The often rich textures of the image come across beautifully. Also on the disc: a video interview with the director and four trailers for other gay-interest films.LAN YU has real emotional impact and sensuality.
