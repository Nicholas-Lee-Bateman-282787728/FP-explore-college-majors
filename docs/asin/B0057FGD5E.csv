The plot started with Squid Girl coming to surface to invade mankind for polluting the ocean but quickly she found herself in debt for breaking the wall of the Lemon Beach House restaurant owned by Chizuru, Eiko, and Takeru, she ended up working for them to pay off her debt, the comedic moment is mostly revolve around Squid Girl trying to learn to live the surface life though there is a couple of emotional moment that make you really care for the character. Squid Girl talked with fish pun in it with thing like: that's kraken hurt!, you are bunch of silly school of fish, or leave me the squid the alone.Overall, the show is fresh and easy to follow, the comedy is clean and funny, and Squid Girl is charming and moe. I just wish the series was longer than just 12 episodes, technically there's another season of this series but Media Blasters decided to cancelled the release for the 2nd season so I am afraid the 2nd season might not get to see the light of day in the US release hopefully Funimation or other companies will licensed the 2nd season at some point in the future.",5,Squid Girl is tentastic (fantastic) slice of life/comedy title.,1401321600,"05 29, 2014",2014,1171,"['When', 'first', 'checked', 'out', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'already', 'enjoying', 'show', 'very', 'much', 'plot', 'started', 'Squid', 'Girl', 'coming', 'surface', 'invade', 'mankind', 'polluting', 'ocean', 'quickly', 'found', 'debt', 'breaking', 'wall', 'Lemon', 'Beach', 'House', 'restaurant', 'owned', 'Chizuru', 'Eiko', 'Takeru', 'ended', 'up', 'working', 'pay', 'off', 'debt', 'comedic', 'moment', 'mostly', 'revolve', 'Squid', 'Girl', 'trying', 'learn', 'live', 'surface', 'life', 'couple', 'emotional', 'moment', 'make', 'really', 'care', 'character', 'Squid', 'Girl', 'talked', 'fish', 'pun', 'thing', 'kraken', 'hurt', 'are', 'bunch', 'silly', 'school', 'fish', 'leave', 'squid', 'alone.Overall', 'show', 'fresh', 'easy', 'follow', 'comedy', 'clean', 'funny', 'Squid', 'Girl', 'charming', 'moe', 'just', 'wish', 'series', 'was', 'longer', 'just', '12', 'episodes', 'technically', 'season', 'series', 'Media', 'Blasters', 'decided', 'cancelled', 'release', '2nd', 'season', 'so', 'am', 'afraid', '2nd', 'season', 'might', 'not', 'get', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'US', 'release', 'hopefully', 'Funimation', 'other', 'companies', 'will', 'licensed', '2nd', 'season', 'point', 'future']",Squid Girl Series Part 1
1444672,A1RO76WBFX9XRJ,B0057FGD5E,NC,"[1, 1]","Originally I did not watch this series. I saw the premise of it and figured it would be an eco warrior style of series. The ideas have been done so I passed on it. Then I saw a season two being aired in Japan. On that alone, I took another look. If it is good enough for two seasons, then I figure ""maybe I misjudged it?""That in the end turned out to be true. Squid Girl is one of the funniest anime I've seen over the years. Each episode, each character, everything is just fantastic. Squid Girl starts her invasion to get revenge on humans for their treatment of the sea. She makes it to a beach restaurant and there, the hilarity begins as she manages to invade the hearts of everyone there.This is a show that you'll find yourself watching time and time again. You'll also find it safe for many ages. I've shown it to relatives in their 60s and they had a ball with this one. Which just goes to show, you are never too old when you are young at heart. Hopefully we'll get season two released here soon. It just gets better and better. If you can't wait, go watch it online already. But be sure and buy it when it is released! This show is a keeper, there is no doubt about that.The English dub is respectable. It lacks the Musume accent and some of the humor of the Japanese dub but it isn't bad.With that said...Shinraku Shinraku Shinraku Shinraku Shinraku Shinraku IKA MUSUME!!!",5,A surprise hit!,1335830400,"05 1, 2012",2012,1384,"['Originally', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'series', 'saw', 'premise', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'eco', 'warrior', 'style', 'series', 'ideas', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'passed', 'Then', 'saw', 'season', 'two', 'being', 'aired', 'Japan', 'alone', 'took', 'look', 'good', 'enough', 'two', 'seasons', 'then', 'figure', 'maybe', 'misjudged', 'end', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'true', 'Squid', 'Girl', 'one', 'funniest', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'episode', 'character', 'everything', 'just', 'fantastic', 'Squid', 'Girl', 'invasion', 'get', 'revenge', 'humans', 'treatment', 'sea', 'beach', 'restaurant', 'there', 'hilarity', 'invade', 'hearts', 'everyone', 'there.This', 'show', ""'ll"", 'find', 'watching', 'time', 'time', 'again', ""'ll"", 'also', 'find', 'safe', 'many', 'ages', ""'ve"", 'shown', 'relatives', '60s', 'had', 'ball', 'one', 'just', 'show', 'are', 'never', 'too', 'old', 'when', 'are', 'young', 'heart', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'get', 'season', 'two', 'released', 'here', 'soon', 'just', 'better', 'better', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'go', 'watch', 'online', 'already', 'be', 'sure', 'buy', 'when', 'released', 'show', 'keeper', 'doubt', 'that.The', 'English', 'dub', 'respectable', 'Musume', 'accent', 'humor', 'Japanese', 'dub', ""n't"", 'bad.With', 'said', 'Shinraku', 'Shinraku', 'Shinraku', 'Shinraku', 'Shinraku', 'Shinraku', 'IKA', 'MUSUME']",Squid Girl Series Part 1
