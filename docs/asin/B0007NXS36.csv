If I recall correctly, the first part was 3 hours and the conclusion was 2 hours. This DVD is 105 minutes, which means counting the removal of commercials, the DVD should have been at least 3 1/2 hours, not just over an hour and a half!! They chopped up the movie so bad that the sequences don't always make sense- What a waste!!!",1,Don't Buy This DVD!!!!,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,456,"['stupidly', 'bought', 'DVD', 'looking', 'running', 'time', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'mini-series', '2', 'nights', 'recall', 'correctly', 'first', 'part', 'was', '3', 'hours', 'conclusion', 'was', '2', 'hours', 'DVD', '105', 'minutes', 'counting', 'removal', 'commercials', 'DVD', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'least', '3', '1/2', 'hours', 'not', 'just', 'hour', 'half', 'chopped', 'up', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'sequences', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'sense-', 'What', 'waste']",Final Justice

Patty Duke & Martin Sheen are outstanding as parents who, despite their different views about what they can do to get justice for the murder of their son, come together in one of the most moving stories ever written.
