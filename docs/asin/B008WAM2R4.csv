1577122,A1ELOBOYQD6UMQ,B008WAM2R4,Cagneyfan67,"[0, 0]","I was disappointed with the documentary on the dvd. It ran too short and they didn't interview the right people. Hall was in no shape for an interview at this time. Eric and Hulk were in TNA so we couldn't hear from them. We heard from Nash and Waltman but I think it would be better instead of interviewing guys like Booker T, Billy Kidman and Bill Demott they seek out more people who were in the NWO like Steiner, Bagwell, Konnan, Scot Norten and Vincent. I think they would know more about the NWO having been in the group. The matches on the dvd make up for the poor documentary. We get a rare Piper vs Hulk from Superbrawl, Savage vs Hulk from Nitro, Sting vs Hulk on Nitro and DDP vs Savage from Halloween Havoc 97. These are some great lost classics and some of the ones that should be on the previous NWO dvd Back in Black. I guess in the end it must have been difficult to do the documentary missing three major players from the NWO but it could have run a lot longer to get more a history of the NWO. I recommend this to NWO fans and new wrestling fans. The matches are great just know what you are getting into with the documentary. Cheers and enjoy!",3,Great matches bad documentary,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,1162,"['was', 'disappointed', 'documentary', 'dvd', 'ran', 'too', 'short', 'did', ""n't"", 'interview', 'right', 'people', 'Hall', 'was', 'shape', 'interview', 'time', 'Eric', 'Hulk', 'were', 'TNA', 'could', ""n't"", 'hear', 'heard', 'Nash', 'Waltman', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'instead', 'interviewing', 'guys', 'Booker', 'T', 'Billy', 'Kidman', 'Bill', 'Demott', 'seek', 'out', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'NWO', 'Steiner', 'Bagwell', 'Konnan', 'Scot', 'Norten', 'Vincent', 'think', 'would', 'know', 'more', 'NWO', 'having', 'been', 'group', 'matches', 'dvd', 'make', 'up', 'poor', 'documentary', 'get', 'rare', 'Piper', 'vs', 'Hulk', 'Superbrawl', 'Savage', 'vs', 'Hulk', 'Nitro', 'Sting', 'vs', 'Hulk', 'Nitro', 'DDP', 'vs', 'Savage', 'Halloween', 'Havoc', '97', 'are', 'great', 'lost', 'classics', 'ones', 'should', 'be', 'previous', 'NWO', 'dvd', 'Back', 'Black', 'guess', 'end', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'do', 'documentary', 'missing', 'three', 'major', 'players', 'NWO', 'could', 'have', 'run', 'lot', 'longer', 'get', 'more', 'history', 'NWO', 'recommend', 'NWO', 'fans', 'new', 'wrestling', 'fans', 'matches', 'are', 'great', 'just', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'documentary', 'Cheers', 'enjoy']",N/A

1577124,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B008WAM2R4,D.P.,"[7, 7]","It was the storyline/group that lead the change of wrestling to the point where ""sports entertainment"" was at it's most popular than it's been since the 1980's as what started as a hostile takeover became a revolution as you saw the infamous logo almost everywhere & the notes from the theme song are still memorable to this stay...all of this can be put into 3 letters, n.W.o.  This is WWE's second (and better) presentation discussing the history & evolution of this group with new comments from people such as Booker T, Arn Anderson, Dusty & Cody Rhodes, Bill DeMott, Diamond Dallas Page, Kevin Nash, Billy Kidman, Sean Waltman, Vince Russo, Matt Striker, Ted Dibiase, Joe Hennig, Mike Rotundo, Big Show, Lex Luger along with archival comments from Vince McMahon, Eric Bischoff, Scott Hall, Jimmy Hart, and Hulk Hogan.The documentary stars off talking about the signing of big stars from WWE to WCW such as Scott Hall & Kevin Nash going into the details of how everything went down & how the timing was just perfect before discussing how things were done to make the perception of the angle look very realistic & the reactions to the reveal of the infamous ""third man"" at Bash At The Beach.  The new members added to the trio were discussed such as how one man lost his purpose when Eric Bischoff joined the group followed by how the concept of their ""The Following Announcement..."" was created along with how everything they did looked like real chaos to the point where Cody Rhodes told the story of what his Dad told him when he saw Rey Mysterio threw into the trailer.  The popularity of the group was discussed in details about how they were anti-heroes to the point where one current WWE superstar had nWo jerseys for his baseball team, how that came about with unpredictability & realism, and how things got so huge it became it's own brand.  Issues with the group becoming so large was talked about with them adding any wrestler who had some value with Cody & Joe giving their memories on their fathers being the in the group, how it became like a real life gang backstage, how some felt it should have been more exclusive with one talent talking about how he was invited but turned it down, and how there were so many problems (such as the Souled Out PPV) that people just started to not care anymore.  Sting's role against the nWo was briefly discussed before going into the media crossover of celebrities such as Dennis Rodman & Karl Malone & Jay Leno involvement with this group with people giving their different opinions about it including one going as far as to say WCW ""prostituted"" themselves.  One of the biggest highlights of this presentation was discussed next in the beginning of the end of the group starting to the formation of the Wolfpac, the creative control issues, how it started to become overkill with other groups, how evil always won, Vince Russo himself discussing why nWo 2000 failed, and the WWE revival of the group before ending the documentary talking about what the legacy of the group with one person probably saying it best, ""We weren't the Beatles but we were definitely Zepplin.""Matches include:Scott Hall & Kevin Nash vs. Sting, Lex Luger, Randy Savage - This match was subtitled ""The Hostile Takeover"" as this was ""The Outsiders"" in-ring debut after appearing on WCW's television shows for weeks. It should also be noted that this was suppose to be a six man tag with WCW's team against Hall & Nash with a mystery partner only for Hall & Nash to go it alone & Luger being knocked out in the opening minutes making this a regular tag team match. This was a good tag team match with each man playing to their strengths (Nash's size & power, Sting & Hall's in-ring ability, Savage's unpredictability) along with Hall & Nash doing the classic ""double teaming behind the referee's back"" tactics various times. The ending with Hulk Hogan transforming into Hollywood Hogan & the birth of the nWo became one of the most infamous moments in wrestling history.WCW Bash At The Beach '96[nWo: Back In Black]Hollywood Hogan vs. WCW Champion Giant - Hogan's first match since revealing himself to be the third member of the nWo complete with a new look as he was starting to grow in the black beard with the red & yellow colors replaced with black & white.  The first couple of minutes into the match was a game of ""cat & mouse"" as Giant initially kept cutting Hogan off from coming into the ring only for Hogan to keep going to the outside whenever Giant executed an offensive move or his offense didn't work.  Giant showed he had the superior strength advantage causing Hogan to resort to dirty tactics like pulling hair to keep Giant down & the fight to the outside with both men using the ringpost before Hogan got a taste of his own medicine when Giant ""hulked up"" on him.  The match itself wasn't much but showcased the new heelish in-ring style of Hogan with the biggest story behind what happened after the match when the nWo definitely ""left it's mark.""WCW Hog Wild '96[Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Collection]The Outsiders vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Harlem Heat - These teams were almost mirror images of each other as they had the combination of the in-ring worker (Hall & Booker) having a bigger & stronger partner (Stevie & Nash) as Hall & Booker started out as Hall was hip tossed over the top rope at one point before Stevie Ray took a shot on the outside that caused Hall to spit at Stevie before tagging in Nash only for Stevie to take down Nash & give Hall a receipt.  Both teams showed that they had no problems bending the rules to their advantage as they used the same tactics against each other such as taking shots being the referee's back & double teaming with Sister Sherri even getting involved from time to time before she got caught by Hall & got a taste of ""machismo"" for her troubles.  This was the only time I recall these teams facing each other (which is a crime) as they worked well together & had a very good match.WCW Halloween Havoc '96[Allied Powers: Wresting's Greatest Tag Teams]Syxx vs. The Bounty Hunter - This was only on here to showcase the ""nWo Saturday Night"" concept (which Nash went into details about on the ""Legends Of Wrestling"" on the blu-ray) which was completely different than what you saw in regular WCW matches from the production to the nWo members themselves doing everything from the ring announcing to commentary but the in-ring action itself was nothing more than just an ""enhancement"" match.""nWo Saturday Night"" Nov. '96WCW Tag Team Champions Outsiders vs. Steiner Brothers - For those who don't already know about this event, this was the New World Order's solo PPV meaning that it was completely different than any other WCW PPV with Eric Bischoff & Ted Dibiase providing commentary, Nick Patrick refereeing every single match & a completely different look even down to the fact that only the nWo members had entrance music.  The dream match was Scott Steiner's second match back after his back injury as both teams were evenly matched & traded momentum throughout the match causing Hall & Nash to take shots on Rick behind the ref's back to get the advantage building the hot tag to Scott before all four men ended up brawling with Nick Patrick getting caught in the line of fire causing someone else to take matters into their own hands.  Both of these teams would go on to feud over the titles for the rest of the year but this was one of their best encounters in the feud.nWo Souled Out '97WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Roddy Piper - This was the rematch from their previous Starrcade encounter only with the WCW title being on the line & Piper coming straight from spending a week in the Alcatraz prison before this match.  Piper went after Hogan with a vengeance here starting in the isle breaking any rule he can from eye rakes to low blows to choking before even using a chair before taking out other nWo members at ringside.  Hogan was able to regain some control working over Piper & trying to keep him grounded before Piper was able to make his comeback but it was an unexpected presence that would not only turn the favor but also result in a new member of the New World Order but overall it was what you expect from Piper & Hogan although not as competitive as their previous match at Starrcade.SuperBrawl VIIHollywood Hogan & Dennis Rodman vs. Lex Luger & Giant - One year later after the New World Order was born, NBA star Dennis Rodman makes his WCW in-ring debut here with Randy Savage being in their corner.  The match started out with Hogan & Luger going back & forth before Rodman was eventually tagged in complete with him still wearing his bandana & sunglasses showing up Luger with an armdrag before Luger returned the favor arm dragging Rodman's sunglasses & bandana off his face & out the ring but Rodman got more serious leapfrogging & shoulder blocking Luger down before he eventually got caught by Luger & again when he tried to do it against Giant.  Hogan & Rodman worked together with double teaming including a hip toss on Giant & double clothesline while Rodman also threw some elbows in the corner before all four men were in the ring at the same time leading to a special appearance & also a ""Sports Center"" moment.WCW Bash At The Beach '97Death Match: Randy Savage vs. Dallas Page - After having an intense feud for over the past 6 months, their final encounter had to be held under rules where it didn't end until one man was the last man standing.  DDP came in not wearing his ring gear but jeans & t-shirt with his ribs taped as both men started the brawl on the outside with Page choking Savage with his own shirt with Savage targeting Page's ribs with stomps & kicks while also hanging DDP on the ring ropes & both men being so intense that they knocked each other out with a double lariat at one point.  DDP went outside of his usual offense pulling moves like a springboard over the top onto Savage but hit his ribs on the guardrail with Savage hitting a double axe right onto the ribs before continuing the brawling not only on the outside but destroying the stage as well & heading back to the ring where a television camera got destroyed & Elizabeth got involved too many times for one woman's taste as well.  This match was no different than their entire rivalry, intense from start to finish & even after the match too.WCW Halloween Havoc '97Hollywood Hogan vs. WCW Champion Sting - The was the rematch from controversial Starrcade the night before with Hogan being in the usual position of ""challenger.""  Hogan went on the offense early as he jumped Sting the moment he came into the ring followed by elbow drops & chokes before Sting was able to rebound & took the fight to the outside where Hogan was thrown into guardrails.  Both men traded momentum with the referee getting in the way resulting in a bigger controversy in regards to the World Title than we had already had going into the match but it was a better match than their Starrcade one & as a side note, this match was shown from start to finish unlike when it was originally aired.""WCW Nitro"" Dec. '97No Disqualification Match: WCW Champion Randy Savage vs. Hollywood Hogan - This was one of the most unique matches in the history of the not only the WCW Championship at that time but also the nWo as the group had officially split apart into two factions earlier in the night with Hogan in his own Hollywood group & Savage being in what would eventually be known as the Wolfpack while it should also be noted that Savage was coming into this match with a bad leg.  Hogan worked over Savage with punches & choking along with a chair on the outside while The Disciple got in his shots at well.  Savage was able to make a comeback such as using the weight belt but would also end up hurting himself with his bad leg with his offense allowing Hogan to work it over.  Things started to get out of hand with the no disqualification rule with various people getting involved before one unexpected person would end up being a difference maker resulting in a match that was as you would expect from these two at this stage in their career with the No DQ rule helping the match.""WCW Nitro"" Apr. '98WCW Tag Team Champion Sting vs. WCW Tag Team Champion Giant - For those who don't know the story behind this unique match, Sting & Giant were scheduled to face Hall & Nash for the WCW Tag Titles leading into the previous PPV of Slamboree but Giant joined nWo Hollywood the week before the match as they won the tag team titles only for Sting to not join Giant in nWo Hollywood & join the nWo Wolfpack leading to this match where the winner gets possession of both tag titles because these two were unable to work together to defend the titles.  Giant walked into the match smoking a cigarette & blew it in Sting's face leading to Sting to respond with a slap & attempting a ""stick & move"" offense by hitting Giant with moves like the Stinger Splash but Giant's size allowed him to block some of these attempts including Sting just bouncing off him when trying a crossbody & powering out of the Scorpion Deathlock causing Sting to resorting to dishing out extra amounts punishment to try to keep Giant down.  The match was pretty short & sweet.WCW/nWo Great American Bash '98Hollywood Hogan & Eric Bischoff vs. Dallas Page & Jay Leno - Leno made his present felt early on as he threw his drink onto Hogan & Bischoff on the outside while also taking a slap at Hogan when he was locking up with DDP with Kevin Eubanks even throwing Hogan back in the ring when he went to the outside before he was eventually the legal man against Hogan playing the game of ""cat & mouse"" eventually getting Hogan in an armbar & working with DDP for moves like a double clothesline.  Bischoff played the old ""Bobby Heenan"" role where he would only tag in whenever one of them was down with Hogan coming into save him whenever he was in trouble but we did get the eventual Leno vs. Bischoff showdown.  Seeing the names involved with this match (Bischoff & Leno), you got what you would expect with Hogan & DDP doing most of the in-ring work with Bischoff & Leno there more or less for entertainment/comedy relief (depending on your sense of humor) as it was Kevin Eubanks on the outside who got more physically involved in the match than both Leno & Bischoff.  While this was would be acceptable for a match on free TV, this match was the main event on a PPV that didn't go over well with critics both in & outside of WCW.WCW/nWo Road Wild '98War Games Match - Team nWo Wolfpack vs. Team nWo Hollywood vs. Team WCW: Kevin Nash, Sting, Lex Luger vs. Hollywood Hogan, Stevie Ray, Bret Hart vs. Dallas Page, Warrior, Roddy Piper - While this War Games match was still contested with a roofed steel cage surrounding two rings, the rules were slightly different all the previous years in that there were three ""teams"" & you could also win the match by pinfall as well as submission with the person getting the fall challenging WCW Champion Goldberg at Halloween Havoc.  This match told a bunch of various stories & had unique situations such as Bret & DDP starting off the match, what Stevie Ray's intentions were, Roddy Piper showing that it was truly ""every man for himself"", the interaction between Bret & his own teammates, and the Warrior/Hogan confrontation.  This match resembled all the previous War Games matches in recent years where the violence took a backseat to pushing the storylines going forward.WCW/nWo Fall Brawl '98No Disqualification Match: Kevin Nash vs. WCW Champion Goldberg - Goldberg's streak was at 173-0 going into this match with both men taking & countering each others offense causing them to go outside of their comfort zones like going for submissions with Goldberg's anklelock & Nash's cross armbreaker before the hits got more impactful like a punch that knocked Nash down, Nash powering Goldberg down with a clothesline, Goldberg with a spinning neckbreaker & later spinning dropkick along with a snap slam, and even Nash using the low blow.  For two guys who have been know to be very limited in the ring, they gave a good ""big man"" power match with the only negative being the chaotic ending...which is typical of the nWo.WCW/nWo Starrcade '98[nWo: Back In Black; Starrcade: The Essential Collection]WCW Championship Match: Bret Hart vs. Goldberg - This match was during the initial ""Vince Russo"" era of WCW & happened the night after Starrcade where we got that ""screwjob"" ending in the match between these two resulting in Bret Hart forfeiting the championship & having a rematch here to determine the true champion. Goldberg showcased early that he had the clear power advantage before both men decided on the same strategy on working on each others legs with Goldberg executing an anklelock while Bret did a figure four. The big picture though was how everything went down during the match that led to not only a champion to be determined but also ""The Band Is Back Together!""""WCW Nitro"" Dec. '99[Best Of WCW Monday Nitro]Hollywood Hogan, Scott Hall, Kevin Nash vs. Steve Austin & The Rock - This was the in-ring returns to the WWE of Hall & Nash in 6 years while it's been 9 years for Hogan...and also to my knowledge, this was the first ""official"" time that just the original members of the nWo in Hogan & Hall & Nash have teamed together.  Rock was clearly distracted as he kept trying to get at Hogan every chance he had which kept giving the nWo the advantage as Hall & Nash worked him over allowing Hogan to take in & get his shots in whenever Rock was already down while using the strategy of double & triple teaming when Austin was the legal man as well.  This was more of a short teaser match for their upcoming WrestleMania X8 matches but a fun RAW main event overall & as a side note for those hardcore wrestling fans, this is the closest you'll get to a Stone Cold vs. Hulk Hogan match as they did get physical a few times.""RAW"" Mar. '02[nWo: Back In Black]DVD extras include moments such as Scott Hall & Kevin Nash's debuts, Roddy Piper confronting Eric Bischoff, the night after Starrcade when Hogan not only confronts Roddy Piper but someone else who keeps ""dropping the ball"", and the nWo's WWE debut while Blu-Ray extras include various promos from the group.  One special bonus on the Blu-Ray edition of this DVD set is the ""Legends Of Wrestling"" roundtable that airs on the WWE Classics On Demand channel with this discussion revolving around the New World Order group with Michael Hayes, Jim Ross, Gene Okerland, J.J. Dillion, and Kevin Nash with them showing various clips (some taken right from the ""Rise & Fall Of WCW"" DVD) to showcase the top discussion at hand.  Things started off with Nash discussing who the middle man was doing the negotiations between Scott Hall & Eric Bischoff going into the deals of the contract being offered such as ""Sting Money"" & ""favored nations.""  The details of some of the concept was discussed next such as if Eric Bischoff really took credit for this idea, the type of deal Hall & Nash were working under that would later benefit them, what had to be done both in-front & behind the camera to put over that the nWo was separate from WCW, what was incorporated from crossover music into their own image, and who was going to be the ""third man"" if Hogan didn't do it.  The discussion then turned to the idea that WCW wanted to put WWE out of business with J.J. Dillion giving a very detailed answer as to why that was never going to happen regardless of what the ratings were before Nash went into the unorganized issues he had behind the scenes such as royalties for merchandise.  How the nWo changed the business in both a positive & negative direction was up next before going into the problems within the storyline with Nash telling his story behind the infamous ""finger poke of doom"" & why it didn't work (although his timeline for events was WAY off).  The controversial mockery of Arn Anderson's retirement speech was talked about in detail along with the relationship between all the ""Kliq"" members despite being in opposite companies before going into the constantly leadership issues, lack of motivation, behind the scenes politics, the Wolfpack vs. Hollywood feud, and the legacy of the group ended the discussion.The only real fault I can say is that the documentary only went around an hour long which sucks for those buying the regular version of this set but not that big of a deal for those getting the Blu-Ray as the roundtable went into more details.  I liked the matches as they didn't reuse matches from recent DVD releases (except Bret/Goldberg but that's understandable) and put a lot of matches that were previous unreleased or so old that it's nice to see them released again (like the ones from the original nWo DVD a decade ago).  In the end, I recommend this to a fan of the nWo/WCW/""Monday Night Wars"" period of wrestling but if your strictly about the matches then the regular version while those who like promos & discussion & documentaries would be better suited for the Blu-Ray edition.",4,Survey Says...One More For The Good Guys,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,21091,"['was', 'storyline/group', 'lead', 'change',

1577125,A21M6XJHHBQSEC,B008WAM2R4,G. Kroener,"[1, 3]","If only WWE would put as much work into their WCW releases as they do with their own WWE products, this could be a killer DVD set. It is, however, comforting that the DVD about the Attitude era is even slightly more dissapointing.What the nWo is, and where it came from is widely known, so it shouldn't need an introduction. However, after watching this set, you still won't know more than you already did.With 3 full DVDs in this set, I really expected a good, long documentary about the origins of the nWo, and especially where it headed with the Wolfpac, especially during the period of 1999-2000. I expected comments, real comments, by people like Bischoff or Nash and Hall and Hogan, and later participants like Jarrett or Bret Hart, talking honestly about some backstage politics.But what we get is an extremely boring and inconsistent collage that last a mere hour. Yes, basically four years condensed into one hour. And the time after 1998 is only mentioned in a sentence or two. What we get here does not go into detail even a little bit, it basically just covers the major events for the nWo. What statements we get from the participating people, Nash, Hall, Bischoff, Waltman, are all taken from years and years ago, revealing that in fact, save for one or two of them, no real effort was put into making interviews specifically for this set.It should be noted that at the point of production, Scott Hall and probably Waltman too had severe personal issues, but you could have easily made the effort to get other people.One person that is frequently shown is Dusty Rhodes, and I can't help but wonder why that is. He was a member of the nWo for a period, but no doubt that this is not really the person to tell hard facts about backstage politics between the other individuals. His son Cody tells again and again about him watching the shows as a kid. All fine in theory, but when all is done in 60 minutes, it must appear like a great waste of time.Around 50 minutes is spent on the time between summer 1996 and fall 1997, the rest, 10 minutes worth, is spent by all participants saying nothing more but ""once the Wolfpac existed, it wasn't like the good old days anymore"". And that's it. And it would have been endlessly interesting to hear what people had to say why certain decisions were made.To cap all this meaningless fluff off, Vince Russo is allowed a few seconds of screentime to say his great plan (read: disaster) to revive the nWo fell apart when Bret Hart was injured, and that it wouldn't have made sense without him (yes, Russo speaks about making sense).The suspicion arises that the set is in this shape because you couldn't possibly make an honest display of the history of the nWo without having people talk negative about both themselves and others. Very few interesting aspects are very very briefly brushed up against, but discarded quickly.The bitter cherry on this cake is that in the end, they say quite directly that the WWE run of the nWo was made for nothing but monetary reasons and merchandise sales.What makes the set still worthwhile is the second and third discs, which include, amongst the very obvious stuff (like Bash at the Beach 96 and 97, Starrcade 96, 97 and 98) also title matches on Nitro that would probably get lost in the future otherwise (unless WWE decided to release the complete Nitro anthology). But it would still have been nice to include other matches instead of the Starrcade main events that are all on the Starrcade DVD that was released earlier.I would give 1 1/2 stars for the documentary, but the matches themselves raise the set to 3 stars.",3,Shoddy WCW release,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,3613,"['only', 'WWE', 'would', 'put', 'much', 'work', 'WCW', 'releases', 'do', 'own', 'WWE', 'products', 'could', 'be', 'killer', 'DVD', 'set', 'however', 'comforting', 'DVD', 'Attitude', 'era', 'even', 'slightly', 'more', 'nWo', 'where', 'came', 'widely', 'known', 'should', ""n't"", 'need', 'introduction', 'However', 'watching', 'set', 'still', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'more', 'already', 'did.With', '3', 'full', 'DVDs', 'set', 'really', 'expected', 'good', 'long', 'documentary', 'origins', 'nWo', 'especially', 'where', 'headed', 'Wolfpac', 'especially', 'period', '1999-2000', 'expected', 'comments', 'real', 'comments', 'people', 'Bischoff', 'Nash', 'Hall', 'Hogan', 'later', 'participants', 'Jarrett', 'Bret', 'Hart', 'talking', 'honestly', 'backstage', 'politics.But', 'what', 'get', 'extremely', 'boring', 'inconsistent', 'collage', 'last', 'mere', 'hour', 'Yes', 'basically', 'four', 'years', 'condensed', 'one', 'hour', 'time', '1998', 'only', 'mentioned', 'sentence', 'two', 'What', 'get', 'here', 'not', 'go', 'detail', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'basically', 'just', 'major', 'events', 'nWo', 'What', 'statements', 'get', 'participating', 'people', 'Nash', 'Hall', 'Bischoff', 'Waltman', 'are', 'taken', 'years', 'years', 'ago', 'revealing', 'fact', 'save', 'one', 'two', 'real', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'making', 'interviews', 'specifically', 'set.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'point', 'production', 'Scott', 'Hall', 'probably', 'Waltman', 'too', 'had', 'severe', 'personal', 'issues', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'made', 'effort', 'get', 'other', 'people.One', 'person', 'frequently', 'shown', 'Dusty', 'Rhodes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'member', 'nWo', 'period', 'doubt', 'not', 'really', 'person', 'tell', 'hard', 'facts', 'backstage', 'politics', 'other', 'individuals', 'son', 'Cody', 'again', 'again', 'watching', 'shows', 'kid', 'fine', 'theory', 'when', 'done', '60', 'minutes', 'must', 'appear', 'great', 'waste', 'time.Around', '50', 'minutes', 'spent', 'time', 'summer', '1996', 'fall', '1997', 'rest', '10', 'minutes', 'worth', 'spent', 'participants', 'saying', 'nothing', 'more', 'once', 'Wolfpac', 'existed', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'old', 'days', 'anymore', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'endlessly', 'interesting', 'hear', 'what', 'people', 'had', 'say', 'why', 'certain', 'decisions', 'were', 'made.To', 'cap', 'meaningless', 'fluff', 'off', 'Vince', 'Russo', 'allowed', 'few', 'seconds', 'screentime', 'say', 'great', 'plan', 'read', 'disaster', 'revive', 'nWo', 'fell', 'apart', 'when', 'Bret', 'Hart', 'was', 'injured', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'sense', 'yes', 'Russo', 'making', 'sense', 'suspicion', 'arises', 'set', 'shape', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'make', 'honest', 'display', 'history', 'nWo', 'having', 'people', 'talk', 'negative', 'others', 'Very', 'few', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'briefly', 'brushed', 'up', 'discarded', 'quickly.The', 'bitter', 'cherry', 'cake', 'end', 'say', 'quite', 'directly', 'WWE', 'run', 'nWo', 'was', 'made', 'nothing', 'monetary', 'reasons', 'merchandise', 'sales.What', 'set', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'second', 'third', 'discs', 'include', 'amongst', 'very', 'obvious', 'stuff', 'Bash', 'Beach', '96', '97', 'Starrcade', '96', '97', '98', 'also', 'title', 'matches', 'Nitro', 'would', 'probably', 'get', 'lost', 'future', 'otherwise', 'WWE', 'decided', 'release', 'complete', 'Nitro', 'anthology', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'include', 'other', 'matches', 'instead', 'Starrcade', 'main', 'events', 'are', 'Starrcade', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'earlier.I', 'would', 'give', '1', '1/2', 'stars', 'documentary', 'matches', 'raise', 'set', '3', 'stars']",N/A

1577129,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B008WAM2R4,Micheal Hunt,"[0, 1]","Ahh, the nWo. A wrestling faction that could have been phenomenal had it had the ingenuity behind it of Vince McMahon. What started off as a brilliant idea for WCW ratings when Scot Hall's contract with WWF expired, and he showed up on WCW the very next night; A week later Kevin Nash showed up, and eventually a match was planned where they had a mystery 3rd man that turned out to be Hulk Hogan. It looked like Vince McMahon had sent these 3 from the WWF to destroy WCW from the inside. The New World Order was born. A faction that could have been something big, something as big and legendary as say, oh, D-Generation X? But instead became a faction that sold a lot of t-shirts then disbanded because they pretty much came out every week recruiting new members and forgot to actually do some wrestling.It started off as just guys who used to be in the WWF, so it looked like a corporate takeover by WWF was taking place, an invasion if you like, great idea, seeing as how WCW had pretty much hired everyone that was washed up with the WWF anyway. But soon it became apparent that was pretty much all these guys did, recruited others to be part of the nWo. It was a big gang of members and they would bully and beat up guys who where against them. It seemed new at the time, somewhat cool, and refreshing for a while, and even revamped ole' Hulk Hogans career now as a bad dude, brotha. But then they just split into two sides, recruited everyone around them some more, until there was hardly a WCW wrestler left to recruit. So what do you do next? They recruit b-name celebrities and had stupid matches like Jay Leno vs Hulk Hogan, and Karl Malone vs Dennis Rodman. Sigh. Is it any wonder this was the start of the downfall of WCW?By the end there was so much confusion on who was with which nWo or another faction with a similar stupid name and shirt, that eventually it crashed into a wall and the nWo was put on life support. WCW tried to revive itself again in the early 2000's, only no one could see anything to do with Jeff Jarret as a champion of anything but tag teaming would ever work out. Once again, the nWo faded away to nothing. As the WCW finally hit an iceberg and sank, the talent the show actually had was rescued by WWE. nWo would be revived, and a set up to have the ultimate face off of nWo vs DX at long last was in the works, but of coarse, Scott Hall ruined it by being a drunken drug addict and a bunch of injuries put what could of been the best ratings ever in wrestling history was swept under the ring and forgotten about.To find out exactly how something that could have been great had they have known how to keep racing at full speed had any of them had their drivers license is done, then this DVD's hour long presentation of rehashed clips from the last nWo release on DVD is just what the doctor ordered. See Cody Rhoads talk about boring things from a fans pov watching the nWo as a kid, and focus more about his grandfather being part of the nWo than anything else. Second hand rehashed information and interviews seen in previous releases, and then enjoy 3 discs of matches and interviews of the nWo boring the pants off you as they gang up on guys who almost beat nWo members in the ring. Oh, and and full coverage of some of the worst matches and ideas in wrestling history, like Hogan running his mouth off for 20 minutes saying, ""This guy in the crowed is now a member of the nWo, this ring post is now a member of the nWo, this railing is now part of the nWo"" then sit back and watch the next weeks clips where they are kicked out of the nWo for not being nWo enough.If only we could get the WWE to finally bring out a DX video that tells it how it was from start to finish, then you would see what a great faction that new what they where doing, and never lost site, had many memorable highlights/moments, not to mention knew when to disband and reform again, then you would see a DVD release truly worthy of watching. Not a DVD filled with guys saying the obvious, ""it started off great, then we blew it"". Way to state the obvious in this waste of time watching.nWo did nothing really. They formed, looked like a WWE invasion, and then messed it up. At least factions like DX has several memorable moments that could not be contained on just one DVD. Yet the nWo gets a rehash treatment? So let's count the nWo memories. Hall shows up on Nitro. One. Nash shows up with him. 2. Hogan is the 3rd man. 3. More recruits of past WWE members. 4. ... ummm... then what? Ummmm... thinking, thinking, thinking... pffftt... no wonder the feature presentation is about 45 minutes long. Come on WWE, bring out the complete history of DX already, not this junk.",2,nWo. They came. They recruited everything in site.

1577134,A1L7PH0CS9BHP6,B008WAM2R4,Tom,"[7, 8]","I just got done watching the NWO dvd set and I have to say the documentary really was not that great.  Of course there was a lot of archived footage from Scott Hall and Hulk Hogan and even Vince McMahon.  There were some new interviews with Dusty Rhodes, Matt Striker,  Cody Rhodes, Kevin Nash, Vince Russo (surpise) and even Lex Luger (also a big suprise).  I wish they could have gotten Sting (of course I knew this was a long shot but was hoping) and also Eric Bischoff (again a long shot).  The documentary just felt rushed, clocking in at only 63 minutes.  Most of the documentaries now run at least an hour and a half so I had a problem with that.  Another thing that was never showed was that Eric Bischoff actually stole the idea of the NWO from New Japan.  They had done the same storyline of a bunch of wrestlers from within the company invading the company.  There wasn't a whole lot of new information told except some of Kevin Nash's comments and also Sean Waltman's as well.  Most of what they talked about was very short and sweet almost like little blurbs so honestly, the documentary sucks.  The matches though was even better.The first match was the Bash at the Beach match that started everything.  Kevin Nash and Scott Hall came into the event to take on Sting, Lex Luger and Randy Savage.  They had promised for weeks that they had a third man but it wasn't until the end of the match where we find out that that third man was Hulk Hogan.  I remeber watching when I was a teenager and not really believing my eyes.  I hadn't seen Hogan as a bad guy since the early 80's so it was nice to see him turn heel.The next match was the Hog Wild 1996 match with Hogan taking on Giant (Big Show) for the WCW world title.  I actually hate this match because after every move the Giant does, Hogan rolls out of the ring so the match gets boring really fast.  I think we all knew that Hogan was going to win but I just wished that they could have made it more exciting.Next we see Hall and Nash take on Harlem Heat at Halloween Havoc 1996 for the tag titles.  This was a good match.  Of course it was another match that didn't suprise us.  The NWO was gaining a lot of momentum at this time so it was only natural that the Outsiders would win the tag titles to go with the world title they had.The next match was Syxx taking on Bounty Hunter on NWO Saturday night.  This was just a standard match, nothing really cool here.  Kind of a waste of space.Up next was the Outsiders taking on the Steiners for the tag titles at Souled out 1997.  I like this one.  I know from the documentary that Kevin Nash hated this PPV but I actually like the PPV and thought it was pretty innovative for its time.  The match itself was a lot of back and forth action and just really rocked.  I liked this one.The next match was a Starrcade 1996 rematch between Hulk Hogan and Roddy Piper at Superbrawl VII in 1997 for the world title.  I remember the whole buildup for this one was just laughable.  I remember the match took place in San Francisco and they tried to say that Piper prepared for the match by staying in Alcatraz.  Really?  So what!  It's not like there was anyone there to challenge him to fights.  It was abandoned!  However, the match itself was good.  I don't think it was as good as Starrcade but it was still good.The next match was Hulk Hogan and NBA star Dennis Rodman taking on Lex Luger and Giant from Bash at the Beach 1997.  This match was very good.  I was actually suprised at how well Rodman worked in the ring.  I remember the media coverage that this match got and I think it helped to make the match even better then it would have been.The next match was a Sudden Death match between Randy Savage and DDP.  I remember these two had a great feud in 1997 and this was the match I was really looking forward to.  I loved it from start to finish.  This was a great feud and this match was one of the best matches they had in the series between them two.  The one thing I was suprised about was the fact that not a lot of ""plunder"" was used in the match but it was still worth seeing.Up next was the Starrcade 1997 rematch between Sting and Hulk Hogan for the World title.  I remember watching Nitro the night this happened and I remembered that the match never ended cause they said they ran out of time so it was nice that the WWE included the ending to the match after Nitro went off the air.  Good match and worth seeing.Up next is a WCW world title match between Randy Savage and Hulk Hogan from Nitro in 1998.  This match actually took place the night after Spring Stampede when Savage beat Sting for the title.  I was expecting a fairly nice title reign for Savage but I guess Hogan pulled some strings to ensure that he would win the belt.  It was a good match but a really messed up ending.The next match is for control of the WCW tag titles between Sting and The Giant at Great American Bash 1998.  This match was short but it was actually a good match.  Sting wins and because of the win he got to hold both of the tag titles and choose his tag partner.  That was kind of confusing but the match was good.The next match was DDP and Jay Leno taking on Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff at Road Wild 1998.  Honestly, this match is really good.  Leno I thought was really good.  He really suprised me as a good worker.  I think the fans were into it hardcore and the media was courious about how well or not Leno would do and honestly, I don't think it disappointed.Up next was the War Games match from Fall Brawl 1998.  This was a weak match.  I hated the rules to it.  There were three teams:  NWO Wolfpac, NWO black and white and WCW.  There were teams but it was also every man for himself because whoever won got a world title shot at Halloween Havoc.  The match itself just wasn't that great but there were some cool people involved like Bret Hart, DDP, Hulk Hogan, Warrior, Lex Luger, Sting and many others.  I wish they would have chosen another match over this one.The next match was the Starrcade 1998 world title match between Kevin Nash and Goldberg.  This match has been released many times and I think needs to be retired.  It's good but it's not that good that it needs to be released so many times.Up next is Bret Hart taking on Goldberg for the vacant world title on Nitro in 1999.  This match was just an ok match.  The ending was just too busy and poorly booked but it was still pretty good.Lastly, we get the handicapped match from Raw with Hall, Nash and Hogan taking on Rock and Steve Austin.  This was like a dream match but the action wasn't that great.  Sadly, this will probably the only time we will ever get a chance to see Austin and Hogan in the ring wrestling.  The match was just ok.So all in all, the DVD was pretty good.  The documentary was pretty dull because there was really nothing new to add to what we already know.  The match selection was good but could have been better.  Some matches I wish they would have included was:  Hogan against Savage from Halloween Havoc 1996, the elminiation match from Uncensored 1997, the War Games match from Fall Brawl 1997 and the tag team bat mach from Spring Stampede 1998.  There are so many others but I can't remember them all at this time.  They also maybe could have included another disc of infamous interviews and moments from the NWO.  That would have been cool to see that.So, in closing, I was a little disappointed in the DVD but the matches were worth the purchase.  Hopefully WWE will do better with their next documentary set.",3,GOOD MATCHES NOT SO GOOD DOCUMENTARY,1352160000,"11 6, 2012",2012,7539,"['just', 'got', 'done', 'watching', 'NWO', 'dvd', 'set',
