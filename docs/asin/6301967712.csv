279341,A1UI21TOBFCY86,6301967712,"Amazon Customer ""Mona0825""","[10, 12]","I have mixed feelings about this movie. For one side, I find it awful; a complete oversimplification of one of the all time literary masterpieces, too focused on just one of the three main characters. But in the other side, one must understand that it's impossible to visually encase -not even in a 9 hours long miniseries, much less in a two hours movie- all the religious, philosophic and melodramatic issues of such pivotal book.Given that, I appreciate the excellent production values and the few, short scenes that are almost carbon copied from the book. It also has a very fluid pacing and great narrative string. And the cast is near perfection:  I can't imagine anybody else playing Father Karamazov than Lee C. Jacobs; also perfect as Dimitri is macho man par excellence Yul Brynner . And although I would like to see Richard Basehart looking 10 years younger, he is Ivan Karamazov. There was no better actor to portray the layers of complexity of this character; cold and intellectual in the surface but at the same time conflicted with both the sensual instincts of Dimitri and the mystical concerns of younger Alexsei.  William Shatner and Albert Sami are very good also; my only cast quibble is Maria Schell as Grushenka, I find her simply annoying!And that's my ultimate content about this movie: it has such an excellent cast that it's a pity its main focus is Dimitri's and that we don't get to see much of the others  ... just imagine what an extra five minutes scene showing Ivan's delirium with his devil would had added to the movie ...In the end, it's still good to own it. But please, oh please, powers to be, give us a proper DVD release. This item is a Spanish DVD release with the original English and also Spanish dubbed soundtrack. Neither the quality of the sound or the image is very good, but watchable enough. Despite falling short on almost everything but the great cast, this movie deserves wider availability.",3,A wasted chance to make a great movie,1296172800,"01 28, 2011",2011,1943,"['have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'movie', 'one', 'side', 'find', 'awful', 'complete', 'oversimplification', 'one', 'time', 'literary', 'masterpieces', 'too', 'focused', 'just', 'one', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'other', 'side', 'one', 'must', 'understand', 'impossible', 'visually', 'encase', '-not', 'even', '9', 'hours', 'long', 'miniseries', 'much', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'movie-', 'religious', 'philosophic', 'melodramatic', 'issues', 'such', 'pivotal', 'book.Given', 'appreciate', 'excellent', 'production', 'values', 'few', 'short', 'scenes', 'are', 'almost', 'carbon', 'copied', 'book', 'also', 'very', 'fluid', 'pacing', 'great', 'narrative', 'string', 'cast', 'near', 'perfection', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anybody', 'else', 'playing', 'Father', 'Karamazov', 'Lee', 'C.', 'Jacobs', 'also', 'perfect', 'Dimitri', 'macho', 'man', 'par', 'excellence', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Richard', 'Basehart', 'looking', '10', 'years', 'younger', 'Ivan', 'Karamazov', 'was', 'better', 'actor', 'portray', 'layers', 'complexity', 'character', 'cold', 'intellectual', 'surface', 'same', 'time', 'conflicted', 'sensual', 'instincts', 'Dimitri', 'mystical', 'concerns', 'younger', 'Alexsei', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Albert', 'Sami', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'also', 'only', 'cast', 'quibble', 'Maria', 'Schell', 'Grushenka', 'find', 'simply', 'annoying', 'ultimate', 'content', 'movie', 'such', 'excellent', 'cast', 'pity', 'main', 'focus', 'Dimitri', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'much', 'others', 'just', 'imagine', 'what', 'extra', 'five', 'minutes', 'scene', 'showing', 'Ivan', 'delirium', 'devil', 'would', 'had', 'added', 'movie', 'end', 'still', 'good', 'own', 'please', 'oh', 'please', 'powers', 'be', 'give', 'proper', 'DVD', 'release', 'item', 'Spanish', 'DVD', 'release', 'original', 'English', 'also', 'Spanish', 'dubbed', 'soundtrack', 'quality', 'sound', 'image', 'very', 'good', 'watchable', 'enough', 'falling', 'short', 'almost', 'everything', 'great', 'cast', 'movie', 'wider', 'availability']",The Brothers Karamazov 1958  VHS

Yul Brynner does a pretty fair job portraying the flamboyant Dmitri, Lee Cobb a good job with the selfish and glutenous father. The actor doing the illegitimate half brother is suitably evil and scheming - maybe a little too much so.

The weather and the lighting matched the weight of the subject. The various actors gave great performances. William Shatner in his film debut, with barely a hint of the Captain who was to come. Lee J. Cobb was thoroughly dissolute, the character you would love to hate. William Basehart was somewhat less compelling but his character was nonetheless important to the story. Yul Brynner was at his best as his character developed. You could see his fascination with Grushenka turn to obsession. There is a wonderful scene as he speaks with his brother, the Shatner character, and reveals his understanding that he is obsessed and his inability to do anything about it. Albert Salmi was particularly effective in the character of the bastard son who finally strikes back. I did find the total turnaround of Maria Schell's character (Grushenko) to be somewhat less than credible. She was beautiful and vitally alive, but her character's continual smirk and inability to remain consistent from moment to moment did not lend themselves to the abrupt change that was presented toward the end of the film.

279349,A22AL5CB23F2SK,6301967712,"Karran ""karran_s""","[1, 2]","I'm a great fan of Dostoevsky and have read most of his works. ""The Brothers Karamazov"" is his last masterpiece, after a string of other wonderful books from ""Crime and Punishment"", ""The Idiot"", ""The Possessed"" and tons of short stories / novellas (""White Nights"", ""Notes from the Underground"", ""The Double""...).. I could go on and on, but a writer like Dostoevsky comes along once every few centuries. It's a challenging task to film any of his books, as his writing is so personal, getting deep within the character, exposing their innermost thoughts to the point where you become uncomfortable, as we identify the darkness within ourselves, something that is part of every human being.. There is no black and white with Dostoevsky, everything is gray and the human soul is presented for what it is - an imperfect, conflicted, complex thing that we work on daily, every hour, every minute and every second, as there is an abyss that could open at any minute. However, the ""good"" strive to better themselves, to overcome their flaws after recognizing them for what it is, with deep honesty. This is true of Dmitri, a very complex character, full of life, determination, courage, honor but ultimately, very flawed in many ways. This dangerous ground is what Dostoevsky makes his characters tread, it is what makes them human and we're able to identify ourselves in each of them. That honesty is rare and cannot be easily translated onto the screen.In this film, there is a simplistic focus on just one character, Dmitri Karamazov and his relationship with his father, his mistress and his betrothed. However, all of these other characters are secondary, including the greatest character in the book, Ivan Karamazov, whose tormented soul is but barely glimpsed in this novel, as also Alyosha / Father Zossima (another conflicted mystic) / Smerdayakov (the illegitimate son). As some reviewers have pointed out, forget about the book and watch it just as a movie and it's fine, with a great performance by Yul Brynner. In every scene he's in, he dominates the landscape and you can't take your eyes away from him. Yul does a fantastic job of presenting Dmitri to the audience and in many respects, he is true to the book and makes him come alive. I couldn't really identify with any of the other characters, including the father (I had a slightly different image in my mind when I read the book). Most of the other characters are mere cardboard cutouts, with zero depth.",3,See this for Yul Brynner not Dostoevsky,1377561600,"08 27, 2013",2013,2468,"[""'m"", 'great', 'fan', 'Dostoevsky', 'have', 'read', 'most', 'works', 'Brothers', 'Karamazov', 'last', 'masterpiece', 'string', 'other', 'wonderful', 'books', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'Idiot', 'Possessed', 'tons', 'short', 'stories', '/', 'novellas', 'White', 'Nights', 'Notes', 'Underground', 'Double', '..', 'could', 'go', 'writer', 'Dostoevsky', 'along', 'once', 'few', 'centuries', 'challenging', 'task', 'film', 'books', 'writing', 'so', 'personal', 'getting', 'deep', 'character', 'exposing', 'innermost', 'thoughts', 'point', 'where', 'become', 'uncomfortable', 'identify', 'darkness', 'ourselves', 'something', 'part', 'human', 'being..', 'black', 'white', 'Dostoevsky', 'everything', 'gray', 'human', 'soul', 'presented', 'what', 'imperfect', 'conflicted', 'complex', 'thing', 'work', 'daily', 'hour', 'minute', 'second', 'abyss', 'could', 'open', 'minute', 'However', 'good', 'strive', 'better', 'overcome', 'flaws', 'recognizing', 'what', 'deep', 'honesty', 'true', 'Dmitri', 'very', 'complex', 'character', 'full', 'life', 'determination', 'courage', 'honor', 'ultimately', 'very', 'flawed', 'many', 'ways', 'dangerous', 'ground', 'what', 'Dostoevsky', 'characters', 'tread', 'what', 'human', ""'re"", 'able', 'identify', 'honesty', 'rare', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'easily', 'translated', 'screen.In', 'film', 'simplistic', 'focus', 'just', 'one', 'character', 'Dmitri', 'Karamazov', 'relationship', 'father', 'mistress', 'betrothed', 'However', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'secondary', 'including', 'greatest', 'character', 'book', 'Ivan', 'Karamazov', 'tormented', 'soul', 'barely', 'glimpsed', 'novel', 'also', 'Alyosha', '/', 'Father', 'Zossima', 'conflicted', 'mystic', '/', 'Smerdayakov', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'forget', 'book', 'watch', 'just', 'movie', 'fine', 'great', 'performance', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'scene', 'landscape', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'away', 'Yul', 'fantastic', 'job', 'presenting', 'Dmitri', 'audience', 'many', 'respects', 'true', 'book', 'come', 'alive', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'identify', 'other', 'characters', 'including', 'father', 'had', 'slightly', 'different', 'image', 'mind', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'Most', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'mere', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'zero', 'depth']",The Brothers Karamazov 1958  VHS
279350,ABHBURBXUZFF8,6301967712,Kurt Miller,"[0, 0]","The Brothers Karamazov is a 1958 film produced by MGM, directed by Richard Brooks and based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel of the same name. It relates the story of Dmitri, a young libertine who seeks reformation by making great endeavours to help the people he wronged. He lives recklessly but for all of his faults (borrowing money without repayment, hot temper, impulsive disposition, etc.) he is an honest man with a clean conscience.Yul Bryner plays Dmitri and that's unfortunate. Dmitri is supposed to be melodrammatic, extreme and excessive in everything he says and does, requiring an actor with a more hammy style.(Marlon Brando, Charlton Heston, Peter O'Toole, etc.) I think Bryner was a wonderful, wonderful actor; his cold, detached, subtle style just wasn't right for this particular role.On the other hand, I enjoyed the rest of the cast. Lee Cobb is hilarious as the sleazy, clownish Papa Karamazov, Claire Bloom was very beautiful and captured the essence of the prideful, jealous Katerina well and Maria Schell had the right sweetness and michievousness to play Grushenka.I've never hated a villain more than Smerdyakov. (Albert Salmi) Horrid Smerdyakov with the weird face and whinny voice. I wanted to see him suffer, to get a comeuppance. Sadly, when the police come to arrest him, he saves them the trouble. NUTS!Much criticism has been made about William Shatner as Alyosha. Frankly, there's nothing he did wrong; his role was just so regulated. Richard Baseheart is servicable as Ivan although I think Leo Genn would have made a better choice. David Opatoshu is excellent as the world weary Captain Snegiryov and the scenes with his sickly son Ilyusha are a tearjerker.Richard Brooks' screenplay is superb--flawless pacing and dialogue crackling with wit and intelligence.All in all, this is a fine movie with good performances and not lacking the essence of Dostoyevsky's classic.Four Stars.",4,"""It was only because I believed in you that I did it.""",1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,1914,"['Brothers', 'Karamazov', '1958', 'film', 'produced', 'MGM', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'based', 'Fyodor', 'Dostoyevsky', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'story', 'Dmitri', 'young', 'libertine', 'who', 'reformation', 'making', 'great', 'endeavours', 'help', 'people', 'wronged', 'recklessly', 'faults', 'borrowing', 'money', 'repayment', 'hot', 'temper', 'impulsive', 'disposition', 'etc', 'honest', 'man', 'clean', 'conscience.Yul', 'Bryner', 'Dmitri', 'unfortunate', 'Dmitri', 'supposed', 'be', 'melodrammatic', 'extreme', 'excessive', 'everything', 'requiring', 'actor', 'more', 'hammy', 'style', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'etc', 'think', 'Bryner', 'was', 'wonderful', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'cold', 'detached', 'subtle', 'style', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'particular', 'role.On', 'other', 'hand', 'enjoyed', 'rest', 'cast', 'Lee', 'Cobb', 'hilarious', 'sleazy', 'clownish', 'Papa', 'Karamazov', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'was', 'very', 'beautiful', 'captured', 'essence', 'prideful', 'jealous', 'Katerina', 'well', 'Maria', 'Schell', 'had', 'right', 'sweetness', 'michievousness', 'play', 'Grushenka.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'hated', 'villain', 'more', 'Smerdyakov', 'Albert', 'Salmi', 'Horrid', 'Smerdyakov', 'weird', 'face', 'whinny', 'voice', 'wanted', 'see', 'suffer', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'Sadly', 'when', 'police', 'come', 'arrest', 'trouble', 'Much', 'criticism', 'been', 'made', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Alyosha', 'Frankly', 'nothing', 'did', 'wrong', 'role', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'regulated', 'Richard', 'Baseheart', 'servicable', 'Ivan', 'think', 'Leo', 'Genn', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'choice', 'David', 'Opatoshu', 'excellent', 'world', 'weary', 'Captain', 'Snegiryov', 'scenes', 'sickly', 'son', 'Ilyusha', 'are', 'tearjerker.Richard', 'Brooks', 'screenplay', 'superb', 'flawless', 'pacing', 'dialogue', 'crackling', 'wit', 'intelligence.All', 'fine', 'movie', 'good', 'performances', 'not', 'lacking', 'essence', 'Dostoyevsky', 'classic.Four', 'Stars']",The Brothers Karamazov 1958  VHS

He and his strong-willed son (Yul Brynner) compete for the same woman (Maria Schell). The family which also has three other sons is torn apart by excesses of every description and some of the characters seem much larger than life - especially Brynner and Cobb. The thoroughly competent supporting cast includes Claire Bloom, Richard Basehart and William Shatner.The film was based on a novel by Feodor Dostoevsky. It received one Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (Lee J. Cobb).

279358,A6FIAB28IS79,6301967712,Samuel Chell,"[2, 2]","Actually, the script is a fairly bare-bones version of Dostoevsky's sweeping epic about a family of sharply delineated characters, but the casting and acting along with a fair amount of cinematic action and heated romance (Maria Schell's Grushenka is ravishing) is more than enough to capture a young male spectator's fancy, leading him to the original literary source, with its famed ""Grand Inquisitor"" chapter (omitted from the film version).You know that this family of a lecherous, drunken father (Cobb) and four equally individualistic and independent sons is not exactly representative of your ""normal"" 19th century Victorian family when the most sane and sober, composed and rational member of the group is William Shatner, the young monk!The film might even hold up--at least in several of its characterizations and in the electricity generated by Brynner and Schell-- after reading the novel, but I wouldn't count on it.  It's the perfect preliminary to a reading of Dostoevsky's great novel (though I have little doubt that ""Crime and Punishment"" would have seemed at least a little less boring, mono-thematic and interminable had I read it before, rather than after, ""Brothers Karamazov"").  On the other hand, after ""C & P"" many readers may not have sufficient motivation to take on ""Brothers Karamazov,"" a far stronger story (or, if the reader insists, ""C & P"" is Dostoesvsky's ""Iliad"" whereas ""Brothers"" is his ""Odyssey"").This film has a warm heart, and there's an unmistakable fiery glow to many of the indoor scenes, as if the director relied primarily on the natural light from a fire place to portray the heated passion of characters whose ardor cannot be cooled by the deep Russian winter.  Whereas film versions of of ""War and Peace"" and ""Dr. Zhivago"" emphasize the the crystalline and icy, coldly beautiful and frigidly repelling landscape of the Russian countryside, seeming rather static in their representation of frozen if dangerous beauty, ""The Brothers Karamazov"" concentrates squarely on its unforgettable (even after 50 years) seven main characters, each of whom delivers beyond expectations.  Just as I'd spend extra on Blu Ray for a film like ""Picnic,"" the better to experience the sparks thrown off by Holden and Novak, the encounters between Bryner and Schell are every bit as heated, practically calling for not just a Blu Ray remastered print but, if you can find one, an asbestos suit!Even though Maria Schell's and Brynner's chemistry in the foreground of the frame is likely to make either the love of any impressionable viewer's life, there are enough implicit theological themes in the margins of the frame for the reader's later discovery of the life of love that is the author's primary concern. In the film, selfish desires and Eros rule (Schell is irresistible) ; in the novel, Agape wins the day.",5,"Not a great adaptation but superlative cast, memorable acting, strong motivation to read the source.",1311120000,"07 20, 2011",2011,2840,"['Actually', 'script', 'fairly', 'bare-bones', 'version', 'Dostoevsky', 'sweeping', 'epic', 'family', 'sharply', 'delineated', 'characters', 'casting', 'acting', 'along', 'fair', 'amount', 'cinematic', 'action', 'heated', 'romance', 'Maria', 'Schell', 'Grushenka', 'ravishing', 'more', 'enough', 'capture', 'young', 'male', 'spectator', 'fancy', 'leading', 'original', 'literary', 'source', 'famed', 'Grand', 'Inquisitor', 'chapter', 'omitted', 'film', 'version', '.You', 'know', 'family', 'lecherous', 'drunken', 'father', 'Cobb', 'four', 'equally', 'individualistic', 'independent', 'sons', 'not', 'exactly', 'representative', 'normal', '19th', 'century', 'Victorian', 'family', 'when', 'most', 'sane', 'sober', 'composed', 'rational', 'member', 'group', 'William', 'Shatner', 'young', 'monk', 'film', 'might', 'even', 'hold', 'up', 'least', 'several', 'characterizations', 'electricity', 'generated', 'Brynner', 'Schell', 'reading', 'novel', 'would', ""n't"", 'count', 'perfect', 'preliminary', 'reading', 'Dostoevsky', 'great', 'novel', 'have', 'little', 'doubt', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'least', 'little', 'less', 'boring', 'mono-thematic', 'interminable', 'had', 'read', 'rather', 'Brothers', 'Karamazov', 'other', 'hand', 'C', 'P', 'many', 'readers', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'sufficient', 'motivation', 'take', 'Brothers', 'Karamazov', 'far', 'stronger', 'story', 'reader', 'C', 'P', 'Dostoesvsky', 'Iliad', 'Brothers', 'Odyssey', '.This', 'film', 'warm', 'heart', 'unmistakable', 'fiery', 'glow', 'many', 'indoor', 'scenes', 'director', 'relied', 'primarily', 'natural', 'light', 'fire', 'place', 'portray', 'heated', 'passion', 'characters', 'ardor', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'cooled', 'deep', 'Russian', 'winter', 'Whereas', 'film', 'versions', 'War', 'Peace', 'Dr.', 'Zhivago', 'emphasize', 'crystalline', 'icy', 'coldly', 'beautiful', 'frigidly', 'repelling', 'landscape', 'Russian', 'countryside', 'seeming', 'rather', 'static', 'representation', 'frozen', 'dangerous', 'beauty', 'Brothers', 'Karamazov', 'squarely', 'unforgettable', 'even', '50', 'years', 'seven', 'main', 'characters', 'whom', 'delivers', 'expectations', 'Just', ""'d"", 'spend', 'extra', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'film', 'Picnic', 'better', 'experience', 'sparks', 'thrown', 'off', 'Holden', 'Novak', 'encounters', 'Bryner', 'Schell', 'are', 'bit', 'heated', 'practically', 'calling', 'not', 'just', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'remastered', 'print', 'can', 'find', 'one', 'asbestos', 'suit', 'Even', 'Maria', 'Schell', 'Brynner', 'chemistry', 'foreground', 'frame', 'likely', 'make', 'love', 'impressionable', 'viewer', 'life', 'are', 'enough', 'implicit', 'theological', 'themes', 'margins', 'frame', 'reader', 'later', 'discovery', 'life', 'love', 'author', 'primary', 'concern', 'film', 'selfish', 'desires', 'Eros', 'rule', 'Schell', 'irresistible', 'novel', 'Agape', 'day']",The Brothers Karamazov 1958  VHS
