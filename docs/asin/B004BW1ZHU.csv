1395652,A2DYMDOAJURO5F,B004BW1ZHU,"Aceto ""All Knowledge is Sorrow""","[2, 4]","Everyday is a family prison movie.  They are each in a cell, rattle the bars quite a bit, and help make each other miserable.  Every day.  In every way.  And then some more.  They cannot communicate.  They cannot understand either life or each other.  Not a particularly bad bunch of people of different ages.  But not much of a family either.  The cast is pretty strong, including the young ones whom you probably do not know.  Helen Hunt tries to help her dying father, but cannot.  He is a musician and tries to help the young violinist, but he cannot.  And the boy cannot be helped.  He knows his playing is troubled, but cannot latch onto his grandfather's insight.  Lev Schreiber is a TV writer and has been unsuited to the lifestyle.  It is as if he crosses over to another planet each day from Queens to Manhattan.  Eddie Izzard, along with the gay teen, gives the best performance. Izzard is the only one in his element; and he is a two dimensional foil for Liev to shred him self for.  Carla Gugino plays the shredder quite competently.  Ezra Miller carries the rest of the movie as the struggling teen, aptly named Jonah.I suspect the director is responsible for one star loss.  Direction is either absent or shallow.  Music ought play a larger part than he allows.  The soundtrack in fine and music could make the axis of the youngest and oldest strong and structural.  The writing loses the other star.  The ending is gratefully received.",3,The cast is better than the movie allows,1302307200,"04 9, 2011",2011,1451,"['Everyday', 'family', 'prison', 'movie', 'are', 'cell', 'rattle', 'bars', 'quite', 'bit', 'help', 'make', 'other', 'miserable', 'day', 'way', 'then', 'more', 'can', 'not', 'communicate', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'life', 'other', 'Not', 'particularly', 'bad', 'bunch', 'people', 'different', 'ages', 'not', 'much', 'family', 'either', 'cast', 'pretty', 'strong', 'including', 'young', 'ones', 'whom', 'probably', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'help', 'dying', 'father', 'can', 'not', 'musician', 'tries', 'help', 'young', 'violinist', 'can', 'not', 'boy', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'helped', 'playing', 'troubled', 'can', 'not', 'latch', 'grandfather', 'insight', 'Lev', 'Schreiber', 'TV', 'writer', 'been', 'unsuited', 'lifestyle', 'planet', 'day', 'Queens', 'Manhattan', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'gay', 'teen', 'best', 'performance', 'Izzard', 'only', 'one', 'element', 'two', 'dimensional', 'foil', 'Liev', 'shred', 'self', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'shredder', 'quite', 'competently', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'rest', 'movie', 'struggling', 'teen', 'aptly', 'named', 'Jonah.I', 'suspect', 'director', 'responsible', 'one', 'star', 'loss', 'Direction', 'absent', 'shallow', 'Music', 'ought', 'play', 'larger', 'part', 'soundtrack', 'fine', 'music', 'could', 'make', 'axis', 'youngest', 'oldest', 'strong', 'structural', 'writing', 'other', 'star', 'ending', 'gratefully', 'received']",N/A

1395654,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B004BW1ZHU,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 4]","Writer and producer Richard Levine is known for his work as executive producer, writer and director for TV series ""Nip/Tuck"" and his work on ""Stark Raving Mad"" and ""Jag"".  His primary work has been with television but with situations happening in his personal life, Levine was able to get personal and write a loosely-based story of those elements that took place when his wife's estranged elderly father came to live with them and how it affected the family.Working together with independent film producer Miranda Bailey (""The Squid and the Whale"", ""The Oh in Ohio"", ""Dead & Breakfast""), Levine wrote and directed ""Every Day"", a low budget film which would feature an all-star cast with Liev Shreiber (""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", ""Salt"", ""Defiance""), Carla Gugino (""Watchmen"", ""Sin City"", ""Night at the Museum""), Helen Hunt (""Mad About You"", ""As Good as it Gets"", ""Twister"", ""What Women Want""), Brian Dennehy (""Ratatouille"", ""First Blood"", ""Romeo+Juliet""), Eddie Izzard (""Valkyrie"", ""Ocean's Thirteen"", ""The Riches""), Ezra Miler (""City Island"", ""After School"") and Skyler Fortgang (""Damages"", ""American Gangster"").""Every Day"" is a 2010 film which focuses on a family in New York.Ned (played by Liev Schreiber) is a writer for a TV series in which his demanding boss Garrett (played by Eddie Izzard) wants more sensationalism in his scripts and since they are not good enough, they are constantly rejected.  Ned is married to Jeannie (played by Helen Hunt), a former working professional who is now stressed out that her estranged father Ernie (played by Brian Dennehy) is no longer able to take care of himself and now he must move in with them.Jeannie has never ever gotten along with her father and Ernie just wishes they left him for dead instead of moving him to New York to live with them.  So, now Jeannie is in a high-stress moment as she must now become a caretaker for her father and constantly bring him to the hospital for tests and take care of him.  And each time she shows compassion, Ernie just shows contempt.  He is rude and is always talking badly to her.Meanwhile, both parents try to take care of their two sons Jonah (played by Ezra Miller) and Ethan (played by Skyler Fortgang).  Jonah is a teenage boy who just came out of the closet and is now starting to become more alert to boys around him.  For Ned, it's hard for him to take it in that his son is gay and is not so accepting of his son taking part in a gay student association and going to a gay prom.  Meanwhile, Ethan is a young boy trying to learn how to play the violin and is curious to those around him.For Ethan, he tends to be picked on by his grandfather Ernie, a music enthusiast (who often has dreams when he listens to music that he is playing drums for a big band), who wants Ethan to improve his violin playing but Ernie uses Ethan to get some pills, which Jeannie is trying to make sure her father doesn't try to kill himself.Because the task of having to take care of her father becomes to difficult, Jeannie thinks its best he stay in a facility where he would be taken care of.  But it would cost $4,000 a month which she and Ned would have to pay for.  And for Ned, it's difficult because although he works as a television writer and gets paid a good salary, his work continually is getting rejected and he worries about his job and also worries about his family.But because the added tension in Ned's personal life and his work life, his boss pairs him up with one of the veteran writers, Robin (played by Carla Gugino), a free-spirit and a woman who just recently broke up with her boyfriend.  She knows that Ned lives a standard, traditional family life but in order to get him to produce the work that he needs for their boss, Ned needs to step out of the box.So, when Ned joins Robin for a writing session, he is shocked that she lives in very nice home with a swimming pool in the city.  Before they start writing, she strips out of her clothes into a bikini and tells him that before they write, they must swim.  When Jeannie calls him, she tells him that she is waiting for him at their son's violin recital.  Ned tells him that their boss is expecting him to work late with writer Robin and to work on a script.  When Jeannie hears Robin's voice, she is upset and feels that Ned may be with another woman.As the tension continues to grow at home with Jeannie's problems with her father, his son Jonah who met a gay man at the GSA prom has asked him out on dates and now Jonah has been lying to his parents of his whereabouts.  For Ned, his time with Robin starts to change him as well as she encourages him to smoke weed, snort cocaine and eventually have sex together.  She wants to bring out the wild side in Ned and Ned notices how its starting to work for his writing but also helping him forget about his problems in his personal life.Until something happens to his family... one night.VIDEO:""Every Day"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  For the most part, as a low-budget film, I felt that Richard Levine and cinematographer Nancy Schreiber did a fine job in capturing the various locations where the family members frequent.  The shot and location at Robin's home is well-done, capturing the hospital and retirement home during Jeannie and Ernie's scenes were well-done, capturing the gay club atmosphere for Jonah was also well-done and for the most part, for a low-budget film, you don't expect to see many shot locations but for this film, you do.For the most part, picture quality was very good for the film.  Detail was very good.  Skin tones were natural, blacks were nice and deep.  While some scenes (which use neon and red lights, typically involving Jonah at the prom or dance club) tend to look like there was slight banding, for the most part, I didn't notice any particles or compression artifacting.  Overall, picture quality for this film was good.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Every Day"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  For the most part, this film is a dialogue driven film.  Dialogue is crystal clear and you get some scenes with good jazz music, especially during Ernie's scenes which sound great.  But there are scenes for example when Jeannie is at the hospital with her father, you can hear the hotel ambiance and hospital speaker through the surround channels.  You can also hear music and other crowd ambiance type scenes through the surround channels.  But for the most part, this is a center and front-channel driven film and lossless audio soundtrack works for this type of film.Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Every Day"" comes with the following special features in Standard Definition (480i/1:85:1):* Trailer - (2:30) The theatrical trailer for ""Every Day"".* Cast Interview - Richard Levine talks about how elements of his personal life were made into a movie, the cast talk about the film and being part of a low-budget film and first time movie director.* Deleted Scenes - A total of seven deleted scenes.JUDGMENT CALL:""Every Day"" is a film that captures the struggles of today's American family.  From getting older, having to take care of elderly parent(s) and children who become teenagers and that time in you life at your lowest moment in hopes that you will find that shimmer of light, that hope in letting you know that things will be OK.""Every Day"" is one of those films where the writing was solid, the performances were well-done and forget that this a low-budget, independent film...not only did I find it entertaining, I also found it touching because although many American families may not have similar experiences as the family depicted in the film, there are elements in the film that parents, elderly parents, teenagers can easily understand because they have felt the same way.As a man who is about to approach his 40's with a family and constantly thinking about the future, what happens to your own parents when they grow older, your children when they become teenagers and also providing for your family, I can understand these characters.  And it helps knowing that these elements are not contrived or trying to find some banality of similar type of dysfunctional family films, this is a film that is based on the writer/director's life.I've known people throughout my life who have had to take care of their elderly parent.  For some, it's not so bad, for others, it became a nightmare.  And unfortunately, not everyone can afford to put their parent up in a facility and the demands of doctor's appointments, medical tests, surgery, etc. is a reality for a lot of people in America.  Jeannie's stressful time of her life is easily understandable.For Ned, being a husband with a wife who is constantly stressed out and busy with her estranged father, a parent who can't identify with his gay son... once again, I think it's a situation that many people can understand.But I have to say that for an independent, low-budget film, it's one thing in creating a film in a short time period but to get as many location shots for this film was well-done.  ""Every Day"" may have had a low-budget but it achieves an efficacy that many other similar big-budget films fail to accomplish. Cinematography was very good and performances were great.  For the most part, ""Every Day"" is a film with a storyline that works when it focuses on the family.  The only thing that I had small problem with the screenplay is the working relationship with Ned and his boss Garrett.  The kind of things that the boss wants Ned to produce for his writing were a bit outrageous and over-the-top.  I can see reality TV trying to push the button but for a dramatic TV series, but how realistic was the situation?  I don't know but if Richard Levine has encountered this type of treatment on ""Nip/Tuck"", but it makes me wonder how outrageous and out of the box he had to go in writing for that TV series.Overall, ""Every Day"" is delightful, touching and enjoyable!  Featuring an all-star cast with wonderful writing and magnificent performances, the film will definitely hit home for a lot of parents who are facing many challenges in their own families and are looking for hope.

Although Carla Gugino is on the cover art, her character isn't developed very much throughout the film. The key protagonist is Lieve Schreiber's Ned, and how he deals with situations that arise every day in his life. Although other reviewers believe this film to portray what people encounter on a daily basis, and I have to agree to a certain extent, I felt a lot of the topics (the son's sexual preference, the grandfather's death wish) were sensationalized or hyped to the push the film a bit towards the edge. Carla is one of my favorite actresses but I was disappointed to see her character written in a two dimensional manner. She is the dynamic single co-worker that refuses to settle down and parties hard. Ned's job is also quite over the top, as a writer for a cable show that I still don't quite understand.In sum, the film wasn't horrible but it's not a must-see, more like a could-rent on a rainy day.Overall: 3/5 stars",3,"Could-rent, wish Carla had more screen time",1302307200,"04 9, 2011",2011,1009,"['DayI', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'prior', 'watching', 'DVD', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'cover', 'art', 'character', ""n't"", 'developed', 'very', 'much', 'film', 'key', 'protagonist', 'Lieve', 'Schreiber', 'Ned', 'how', 'situations', 'arise', 'day', 'life', 'other', 'reviewers', 'believe', 'film', 'portray', 'what', 'people', 'encounter', 'daily', 'basis', 'have', 'agree', 'certain', 'extent', 'felt', 'lot', 'topics', 'son', 'sexual', 'preference', 'grandfather', 'death', 'wish', 'were', 'sensationalized', 'hyped', 'push', 'film', 'bit', 'edge', 'Carla', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'was', 'disappointed', 'see', 'character', 'written', 'two', 'dimensional', 'manner', 'dynamic', 'single', 'co-worker', 'settle', 'down', 'parties', 'hard', 'Ned', 'job', 'also', 'quite', 'top', 'writer', 'cable', 'show', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand.In', 'sum', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'not', 'must-see', 'more', 'could-rent', 'rainy', 'day.Overall', '3/5', 'stars']",N/A
1395657,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004BW1ZHU,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","EVERY DAY resonates with audiences because it is a story that tackles some heavy themes and shows that there is light at the end of every seemingly impossible tunnel. Writer/director Richard Levine has much experience with the topics raised in this film from his broad work as a television writer. The dialogue is smart, sassy, touching and insightful, and that, coupled with a very fine cast, makes this a movie to relish.This day really isn't all that different than every other day, except today Ned's (Live Schreiber) gay son Jonah (Ezra Miller) wants to go to a college party, his wife Jeannie (Helen Hunt) is bringing home her elderly father Ernie (Brian Dennehy) whom she has never been able to tolerate to live with them, and his outrageous boss Garrett (Eddie Izzard) seems to have become even more crazy and demanding than would even seem possible. As his wife tries to take care of her father and reconnect with him, Ned tries to reconnect with Jonah, and then without trying, he seems to have formed a connection with his co-worker Robin (Carla Gugino). Add to this Ned's younger son Ethan (Skyler Fortgang) is attempting to prepare for a violin performance and needs the support of his family, especially his gay brother. If he can get through days like these, he should be able to get through anything else life throws at him. The little miracles that happen in the hands of Levine's script are satisfying resolutions (for the moment, at least) for all the bumps in the road that occur every day.The entire cast is strong, managing to be at times witty and caustic and at other times revealing that at the level of human emotions they are all very vulnerable, need, but survivors. This is a too often forgotten little film that is a pure pleasure to experience. Grady Harp, August 13",5,"`What's happening here is a huge downer for you.

I hadn't seen her in much lately. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and realistic portrayal of the stresses and strains of juggling the role of caregiver with balancing the rest of family life - keeping a marriage together and dealing with the kids.My only criticism of this movie is that Hunt, in her role as Jeannie, comes across as so desperately unhappy, bitter, and angry that she borders on being shrewish at times. On the other hand, she is in a very difficult situation, with a very unhappy, demanding, and critical father as well as the usual challenges of a home, marriage, children, etc.Even though her unhappiness is understandable, it is sometimes hard to feel sympathy for her. She has difficulty maintaining any perspective. She is frequently so upset that I  found it easy to understand why her husband felt lost on the sidelines at times (although he does his best to help ) and also why her children were frequently confused and scared. Her husband also (again, understandably) finds it hard to resist the appeal of an attractive co-worker who makes it clear she is open to evenings full of sex as well as work projects.In spite of any issues with this movie, any viewers (raising hand) may well relate to Jeannie's challenge of trying to care for an aging parent. The primary duties fall to her and she is clearly over her head. She already had a difficult relationship with her father before he became ill and having him move in with her and the rest of her family doesn't make things easier. Brian Dennehy is superb as the father who struggles with both alcoholism and suicidal impulses. He is frequently harsh and critical, not only of Jeannie but also with her children. Lieb Schrieber holds his own as Ned, Jeannie's husband. Then there is Eddie Izzard, who gives a strong, solid performance as Ned's boss.To complicate matters even more, one of Jeannie and Ned's children, Jonah (Ezra Miller) is gay and Ned is having a hard time accepting this. Jeannie is relatively supportive and this is a sore point between her and Ned.As the movie unfurls, there isn't exactly a ""happy"" ending but there is true growth in most of the characters. The movie completely held my interest but that may be only because I related so strongly to the theme. It isn't exactly a sunny or upbeat film. But it is well done and honest. If you're a caregiver for an elderly person, this may be one of the few films that you'll find which doesn't gloss over the realities.",4,Realistic portrayal of the stress of caring for an aging parent while trying to hold together a marriage and family,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,2579,"['happened', 'catch', 'movie', 'demand', 'channel', 'selected', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'much', 'lately', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'depth', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'stresses', 'strains', 'juggling', 'role', 'caregiver', 'balancing', 'rest', 'family', 'life', 'keeping', 'marriage', 'together', 'dealing', 'kids.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'movie', 'Hunt', 'role', 'Jeannie', 'across', 'so', 'desperately', 'unhappy', 'bitter', 'angry', 'being', 'shrewish', 'times', 'other', 'hand', 'very', 'difficult', 'situation', 'very', 'unhappy', 'demanding', 'critical', 'father', 'as', 'well', 'usual', 'challenges', 'home', 'marriage', 'children', 'etc.Even', 'unhappiness', 'understandable', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'difficulty', 'maintaining', 'perspective', 'frequently', 'so', 'upset', 'found', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'husband', 'felt', 'lost', 'sidelines', 'times', 'best', 'help', 'also', 'why', 'children', 'were', 'frequently', 'confused', 'scared', 'husband', 'also', 'again', 'understandably', 'hard', 'resist', 'appeal', 'attractive', 'co-worker', 'who', 'clear', 'open', 'evenings', 'full', 'sex', 'as', 'well', 'work', 'spite', 'issues', 'movie', 'viewers', 'raising', 'hand', 'may', 'well', 'relate', 'Jeannie', 'challenge', 'trying', 'care', 'aging', 'parent', 'primary', 'duties', 'fall', 'clearly', 'head', 'already', 'had', 'difficult', 'relationship', 'father', 'became', 'ill', 'having', 'move', 'rest', 'family', ""n't"", 'make', 'things', 'easier', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'superb', 'father', 'who', 'alcoholism', 'suicidal', 'impulses', 'frequently', 'harsh', 'critical', 'not', 'only', 'Jeannie', 'also', 'children', 'Lieb', 'Schrieber', 'own', 'as', 'Ned', 'Jeannie', 'husband', 'Then', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'who', 'strong', 'solid', 'performance', 'Ned', 'boss.To', 'complicate', 'matters', 'even', 'more', 'one', 'Jeannie', 'Ned', 'children', 'Jonah', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'gay', 'Ned', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'accepting', 'Jeannie', 'relatively', 'supportive', 'sore', 'point', 'Ned.As', 'movie', 'unfurls', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'happy', 'ending', 'true', 'growth', 'most', 'characters', 'movie', 'completely', 'held', 'interest', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'related', 'so', 'strongly', 'theme', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'sunny', 'upbeat', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'honest', ""'re"", 'caregiver', 'elderly', 'person', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'films', ""'ll"", 'find', ""n't"", 'gloss', 'realities']",N/A

1395665,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004BW1ZHU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","Writer/director Richard Levine's ""Every Day"" is an unassuming little picture (albeit one with a pretty impressive cast) that deserves to be appreciated by a wider audience. A story of obligation and compromise, this is a candidly realistic look at a family in turmoil. At times deftly direct, at others absurdly comical--this is a movie that might have dematerialized into a conventionally quirky sitcom. But it is, ultimately, grounded by true drama and strong performances. As a result, this is one of the more satisfying sleepers that has completely exceeded my expectations. Liev Schreiber, Helen Hunt, Brian Dennehy, Ezra Miller, and Skyler Fortgang play the family in question with the always undervalued Carla Gugino and scene stealing Eddie Izzard as workplace colleagues of Schreiber. Every time the film appears to be about to veer into contrivance, the smart screenplay reels things back. It is a perfect balance that Schreiber is largely responsible for--as he is the actor primarily straddling plot lines with distinctly different tones.Schreiber and Hunt have invited her ailing and estranged father (Dennehy) to live with him during his declining health. Hunt, who sometimes falls a bit flat for me, is absolutely spot-on here. Bitter, angry, resentful--this is a letter perfect performance (and the film's best) from start to finish. You may not always like her, but her distant and antagonistic relationship with her father rings quite true as does her decision to try to make him comfortable despite her misgivings. Dennehy tries to maintain dignity as his body betrays him, but does little to ingratiate himself with the clan. Miller, their eldest son, is exploring his burgeoning homosexuality and this is a strain for Schreiber who hasn't quite come to terms with things. And amidst all the domestic drama, Schreiber is struggling at work writing for an insane nighttime soap opera (at least that's my best guess--although the ideas proposed could never make it onto network TV) and engaging in some flirtation with another staff writer (Gugino).The work scenario is played largely for laughs and is surprisingly well integrated into the more serious aspects of the story. At many points, the film could easily have devolved into an over-sentimental mess--but Levine never attempts to manipulate our emotions! I appreciated his level-headed choices. Miller, an exceptionally appealing young actor, is handed the least successful storyline but pulls it off through sheer likability. It's just good to see Dennehy in anything and this is no exception. And Schreiber is the film's glue. I may not have believed every scene between him and Miller--but it's a small point in an otherwise tight narrative. Outlandish and real--it's a difficult combination, but this dramedy really pulls it off.

1395666,A35Q0RBM3YNQNF,B004BW1ZHU,M. Hill,"[1, 4]","I have great affection for independent films and their freedom to explore avenues deemed too small and/or quirky to warrant a major motion picture's budget and distribution. That said, I found Every Day disappointing. The best thing about the film is the beautifully crafted performance by Helen Hunt and the multi-nuanced performance by Brian Dennehy.  The worst thing about the film is the inconsistent quality of the storylines. This is frustrating because the potential for a really good film is there, but not realized.It is no easy task to breathe life into a tired old male mid-life crisis storyline, and this film broke no new ground. The character of Ned, stoically played by Liev Schrieber, is self-indulgent, predictable and unsympathetic. It's hard to like Ned. He sells-out his integrity by both staying in a job he hates and betraying his family by romping with a co-worker just when they really need him. If we show what we are made of when things are difficult, then Ned is made of tissue paper.After his wife Jeannie, played by Helen Hunt, brings her infirmed father (Brian Dennehy) to live in their home, we watch her wrestle with the burden of physically caring for someone she has long since stopped caring for emotionally. As conflicted as she is, her integrity dictates she must take care of her father. This struggle involves sacrifice on many levels. Her burgeoning career is put on hold and attention to family must be doled out in small increments sandwiched between juggling endless doctor's appointments, mountain of prescriptions and difficult demands from her unloving father.Jeannie isn't cast as an angel. Early on she makes some decisions that appear almost vengeful - like not shipping her father's electric scooter, claiming it was too heavy although she willingly had his favorite easy chair and ottoman sent along. That decision left her father in a manual wheelchair, greatly impeding his mobility and independence. It seemed arbitrary and done to punish and control him as he had done to her when she was a child, equally helpless. This storyline has substance and rings true.Some things in the film were resolved too neatly. Some characters were never properly fleshed-out and their actions seemed designed primarily for shock value or to add interest where none existed. They seemed ill-used. Some plot points were delivered with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, leaving the impression the viewer's basic intelligence was underestimated. All of this eroded believability, and for me, intruded on the truly special moments.

So I'm operating under the assumption here that you're either going to rent this movie or possibly watch it on a premium cable channel.Every Day is just a bland story. It's just your average family trouble. The main character, Ned has to deal with bad relationship problems, bad in law problems, and bad children problems. Since all stuff that we've seen  done before and it is been done better. My main problem with the movie was that it's three co-current running plots were just too much for a film that ran a little over an hour. Though I will admit I'm not sure is a longer running time would've been enough to salvage this movie.It certainly watchable, the film has plenty of good actors. Liev Schreiber, Helen Hunt, Eddie Izzard,  Brian Dennehy, and the rest of the cast make the film watchable, but that's about it. It's just not that good of a story.I wouldn't go out of your way to watch Every Day.

It centers on Schreiber, as ahusband and father whose marriage has become a bit tired, andwho learns his wife is bringing her aging and ill father tolive with them.  Brian Dennehy is her father, and he didn'twant to be there, preferring to live independently.  Lievworks for a gay TV producer as a script writer.  The producerwants shocking, envelope pushing stories, which frustratesSchreiber.  Meanwhile he has two sons, one about 11 and theother, a gay high-schooler, which dad finds disturbing.  Thefilms plot centers on Schreiber's character both at work andhome, and a female co-worker who is exploiting his frustrations.The movie could have easily become a tragic story of an affairthat destroys a family, and it walks a fine line.  Withoutgiving away what happens, I felt that it gets things mostlyright, and keeps a sense of humor about it, while addressingthe problems that many marriages encounter when the dailygrind of living, working, and familiarity, can push them tothe brink of breakup.

Based on the description and the fact that I had liked City Island (also from Image Studios), I decided to give this a try.  I don't think the information on the product page gives you a good sense for what Every Day really is, and I hope to give you a better chance at deciding if this is for you.  Ned (Liev Schreiber) is the main character.  His wife Jeannie (Helen Hunt) is stressed because her father Eddie (Brian Dennehy) is moving in.  He has a litany of medical problems, and he can no longer live on his own.  His older son Jonah (Ezra Miller) is gay, and Ned is having a hard time coming to terms with this.  Professionally, Ned is a writer for a TV show that has to have a minimum number of ""shocking"" moments per episode.  It seems that Ned is the new guy, but this is not entirely clear.  His boss Garrett (Eddie Izzard) is over the top in what he considers shocking.  Basically if he's seen it before, it won't do.  Garrett assigns Robin (Carla Gugino) to help Ned with his rewrites.  Robin has just broken up with her boyfriend, and this creates temptation for Ned who's stuck in his routine.The plot plays out in a fairly predictable way, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  What is not so good is that it seems that Every Day tries to follow Garrett's principles.  On screen drug use plays a larger role than I would have cared for.  Jonah finds himself in a pretty dicey situation that, while plays out through his being gay, could just as easily happen in heterosexual scenarios too.  I don't want to give too much away, but I found it disturbing because of the potential for his peril more than anything.  In reality, none of these things are new or groundbreaking in film.  However I don't think the product description does a good job advising potential viewers of the content.  If you seen Helen Hunt and expect something along the lines of As Good As It Gets, (like me) you will be disappointed.  The movie does have good moments of comedy and drama, and I thought that the actors played their parts well.  If you don't mind the elements that I have mentioned above, you will likely enjoy Every Day.  However if you don't like your movies a little more straight laced, it would be a good idea for you to pass on this one.",3,"Well Done, But Know What You Are Getting",1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,2323,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'expected', 'Every', 'Day', 'not', 'what', 'got', 'Based', 'description', 'fact', 'had', 'liked', 'City', 'Island', 'also', 'Image', 'Studios', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'information', 'product', 'page', 'good', 'sense', 'what', 'Day', 'really', 'hope', 'give', 'better', 'chance', 'deciding', 'Ned', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'main', 'character', 'wife', 'Jeannie', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'stressed', 'father', 'Eddie', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'moving', 'litany', 'medical', 'problems', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'live', 'own', 'older', 'son', 'Jonah', 'Ezra', 'Miller', 'gay', 'Ned', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'coming', 'terms', 'Professionally', 'Ned', 'writer', 'TV', 'show', 'have', 'minimum', 'number', 'shocking', 'moments', 'episode', 'Ned', 'new', 'guy', 'not', 'entirely', 'clear', 'boss', 'Garrett', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'top', 'what', 'shocking', 'Basically', 'seen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'Garrett', 'Robin', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'help', 'Ned', 'rewrites', 'Robin', 'just', 'broken', 'up', 'boyfriend', 'temptation', 'Ned', 'who', 'stuck', 'routine.The', 'plot', 'out', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'way', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'What', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'Day', 'follow', 'Garrett', 'principles', 'screen', 'drug', 'use', 'larger', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'cared', 'Jonah', 'pretty', 'dicey', 'situation', 'plays', 'out', 'being', 'gay', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'happen', 'heterosexual', 'scenarios', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'found', 'disturbing', 'potential', 'peril', 'more', 'anything', 'reality', 'none', 'things', 'are', 'new', 'groundbreaking', 'film', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'product', 'description', 'good', 'job', 'advising', 'potential', 'viewers', 'content', 'seen', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'expect', 'something', 'lines', 'As', 'Good', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'have', 'good', 'moments', 'comedy', 'drama', 'thought', 'actors', 'played', 'parts', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'elements', 'have', 'mentioned', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'Day', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movies', 'little', 'more', 'straight', 'laced', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'pass', 'one']",N/A
1395672,A3KJ9UTP3TSDJW,B004BW1ZHU,"Professor Emeritus P. Bagnolo ""Slugger/BIGGUY""","[2, 5]","Every Day [Blu-ray]Please bear with me through a few paragraphs of preamble, which are a bit removed from the story line, but intentionally so in order to set the pace:This story crawls forward against a background of the beginning of the end of the ""American Dream"" as America's social structures are falling apart, gasoline is a $4.50. Taxes alone are driving some people into bankruptcy because they can neither sell their houses nor afford the taxes. Politicians are splitting the nation in half trying to confiscate/destroy unions, and everyone's pensions and health care, except their own. Drive-by shootings of innocent children is now a hobby for some sicko's, rapidly replacing violent, sadomasochistic, porno, and video games.Five percent of the richest people on the planet paid no income taxes last year and yet want bigger tax breaks and GE made $114 billion and paid no income taxes. There are serial nutcase murderers running amok in the big cities, suburbs and rural areas chopping up women, children and goats. Two successive presidents have involved us in fighting, God knows how many wars for the last 10 years at a cost per annum of $1 trillion and an overall debt passing $19.3 trillion, including Bush having blown Clinton's $5.9 Trillion surplus on wars and No-Bid Contracts and President Obama trying hard to put us deeper into debt with accelerating new and endless wars. I could go on endlessly also, but why bother, you already know what is depressing about life in the 21st Century, but I tell you all of this not to depress you as much as that if/when you watch this movie, you will come running back arms spread wide to the realities, back to read the first few paragraphs of this review, because in retrospect, you know that after watching the movie, my depressing intro, in comparison, may cheer you up.Well, except another thing that may cheer you up is the gorgeous Carla Gugino, Carla Gugino in tights, Carla Gugino in a bikini and Carla Gugina nude, in her in-house swimming pool, and trying to entice Ned into a swimming pool seduction, which he appears to be struggling to avoid. Believe me, those ARE the high lights of this film, and about the only thing that may put a satisfied smile on your face regardless of your gender. However, even in those moments there are depressing, fun killing moments.The description calls this film a ""warm and wise comic drama"" which warmness, wisdom, and especially its ""comic"" aspect I must have slept through. The DVD-Every Day, is a story about a person - Ned, who writes bizarre, sadomasochistic porn, for a TV series and including such serial killers I mention above in which calling the scripts ""edgy"" is an understatement. His wife brings her dad home from a nursing home to look after him herself, and then does nothing but complain about him. Her older teen son is a budding homosexual and his dad, the writer is predictably, displaying more than a bit of homophobia and thus appears to worry about his son being raped by an older homosexual and more than that, fears that his may ""hook-up"" with any homosexual, older or otherwise. His wife does not share his views on that subject; the younger son (who I though was a little girl for 1/3 of the film, and no he is not homosexual, he just looks like a little girl) is a normal kid who is understandably confused.Ned's wife climbs into bed each night, but before he can climb upon her, she is off on rants about her fathers zero tolerance, and his incontinence and his miserable personality and mouth. When Ned is on the edge of being fired or quitting, gorgeous Carla Gugino, for God knows what reason, wants him come to her mansion to work overtime and to jump her bones. By now, overworked on stuff he hates, with no access to sex with his wife, for a life choice she made concerning her father who is verbally abusive to one and all, our hero Ned, writer of sadomasochistic, porn is now hornier than a Hefner with his harem surrounding him, but alas, can't find his Viagra.How will it all end? Will Ned be seduced by Carla? Will the old man experience an epiphany? Will Ned be fired? Will an older gay man rape the Teen son? Will the younger son become more, or less, confused? Will the younger brother shake off the old man's annoying sarcasm?Despite all of the heaviness, the film's redeeming features are glimpses of brilliance here and there in the acting and direction. Problem is who cares? If I want misery, I can drive into Chicago and watch the new mayor turn the town into a living specimen of God knows what civic horror...if I could afford the round trip gas bill.Hey, maybe I was a bit harsh but I do not know the variety of reasons for which other people watch movies. I only know why I do. I watch them expecting them to be uplifting, fun and riveting. If I want reality, I can get that way from Documentaries by Ken Burns or Michael Moore, or any news channel. The only way I would normally watch this sort of movie is by my wife's request, and then only if the ushers rivet me to my seat.Helen Hunt is Helen Hunt and she plays her depressing struggle with her conscience part well enough, as always. Liv Sheiber is the long-suffering husband/father (Ned) of the two boys, one of which I thought was a girl for half the movie. (Maybe because I was losing interest so rapidly and monumentally.) Brian Dennehy who has won several major industry awards, was excellently annoying as a dying man with a miserable personality. The problem was that it didn't all come together for me, maybe because it kept hopping about, five minutes with the Homosexual son at a ""Gay Prom,"" five minutes with the old man berating the younger son, five minutes at Ned's studio, five minutes of Ned in the water nude with Carla Gugino, etc. That jumping about like a Wile Coyote/Road Runner, cartoon, disconnected the film for me. At least those cartoons cause you to smile and even laugh.However, all of that being said, if you appreciate soap opera and enjoy watching bitterly disappointing, depressing slices of life in movies, you my well love this one. I did not, sorry. That is as much as I can tell you without ruining the story and how it plays out for you.Three (3) stars are the best I could give it with 2.75 of those stars for the very sight of Carla Gugino, wearing anything or next to nothing. Oh, near the end you may encounter what you may think are positive, uplifting notes, but don't you believe that for one moment. Do you now see what is happening? Most people think I am a very upbeat person, but this film has damaged me. They should have given this warning on the label:""If you are a Chicago Cub Fan and are used to disappointment and depression, nevertheless, this film will still make you still more depressed."" Maybe it is just me, and K am a Chicago Cub fan, God help me, and I hate depressing films. So, watch it if you like, but just don't tell me, because knowing that will just depress me.",3,"Oboy, How Depressing!",1304294400,"05 2, 2011",2011,6949,"['Day', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Please',

Ironically Liev Schreiber (X-Men Origins: Wolverine) plays a screenwriter on a salacious cable television show who writes the ""B"" storyline on the show.  In this part of the movie Eddie Izzard (Mystery Men) plays his sleazy boss and naturally hits the role out of the park.  Then Carla Gugino (Karen Sisco) plays the office flirt.  Now there is a movie I would like to see.Unfortunately at the end of the day Liev goes home to a life that he was already struggling with after his son came out as a gay homosexual and got even harder when his wheel-chair stricken father-in-law come to live with him despite already having a strained relationship with his daughter.  Even though Helen Hunt (Twister) as his wife and Brian Dennehy (She Hate Me) as her father give solid performances their scenes are hard to watch especially juxtaposed  with Liev's entertaining work life.The special features included on the DVD include the movie's trailer, cast interviews and about seven deleted scenes.",2,Everyday Can Be Challenging,1340496000,"06 24, 2012",2012,1090,"['good', 'movie', 'hiding', 'Everyday', 'Day', 'unfortunately', 'resigned', 'B', 'plot', 'movie', 'Ironically', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'screenwriter', 'salacious', 'cable', 'television', 'show', 'who', 'B', 'storyline', 'show', 'part', 'movie', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'Mystery', 'Men', 'sleazy', 'boss', 'naturally', 'role', 'park', 'Then', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'Karen', 'Sisco', 'office', 'flirt', 'Now', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'see.Unfortunately', 'end', 'day', 'Liev', 'home', 'life', 'was', 'already', 'struggling', 'son', 'came', 'out', 'gay', 'homosexual', 'got', 'even', 'harder', 'when', 'wheel-chair', 'stricken', 'father-in-law', 'come', 'live', 'already', 'having', 'strained', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'Even', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Twister', 'wife', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Hate', 'Me', 'father', 'give', 'solid', 'performances', 'scenes', 'are', 'hard', 'watch', 'especially', 'juxtaposed', 'Liev', 'entertaining', 'work', 'life.The', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'DVD', 'include', 'movie', 'trailer', 'cast', 'interviews', 'seven', 'deleted', 'scenes']",N/A

Whoever cast him for the part as the father-in-law with one foot in the grave did a brilliant job.  He looked so different from prior  characters I have seen that I almost did not recognize him.  He is not the big burley figure of his role of the Sheriff in Rambo First Blood.  He was emaciated and frail and fit the part of a cancer treatment patient with urinary incontinence perfectly.I also had a typecast problem with Liev Schreiber.  I have not seen anything major from him other than his roll in the last X Men movie.  I found myself expecting him to stick up his hands revealing long razor sharp fingernails.As far as the part of the wife, played by Helen Hunt.  It was a Typical roll that we have seen her portray in several film and television series. While I think she is very tallented and attractive for her age I have grown tiresome of her typical roll of the habitually agonizing woman.As for the film story itself I found it to be a heartwarming story that hit close to home from problems dealing with an adolescent gay child to dealing with aging parents.I don't want to make this review into a spoiler so I won't go any deeper.  I would recommend this movie if you are a Brian Dennehy fan.I would not recommend the film for children because of some of the sensitive moral issues that are presented.

A writer for a TV show, Ned (Schreiber) is stuck in a job where his boss demands more and more strange things.  His wife Jeannie (Helen Hunt) has just brought her father home to take care of.  His son is gay and Ned is trying to avoid admitting it, and his co-worker (Gugino) is another reason his life is spinning out of control.  So many movies and TV shows come out that claim to be true to life, or ""Reality Shows"", they usually turn out to be so over the top they end up borderline spoofing the stars.  This is one huge exception.  While not being a reality show at all, this is the most true to life movie I have seen in a while.  It was depressing in parts, but again because it seemed like they just took a family and watched how they live and made a movie from it, without changing anything.  Ned is stuck trying to sort out what his life has become that he finds himself trying to be someone he isn't.  This movie is another glaring example of how unless you have a $200 million budget and your movie make $400 million in theaters you will get no recognition or advertising.  There are no big name stars in here like Tom Cruise or Katherine Heigle, and because of only casting good actors and relying on script and acting, it gets overlooked.  Which is a travesty.
