1667960,AHRRWI1E1R6XO,B00ENP2QXC,Aimee Robidoux,"[3, 7]","I watched Nativity! with Martin Freeman to prepare myself for this movie, and was a bit apprehensive because I didn't much like the first film.  Not that the acting left anything to be desired, but when I want a family movie there are certain lines that I draw in the sand.  The two biggest problems I had with the first film were:1) Martin's character Mr. Maddens had clearly been living with his girlfriend&#8211;they were not married, and there seemed to be no assurance they ever would.2) Some of the dance moves that Mr. Poppy taught the children were clearly sexual in nature.My family believes in the sanctity of marriage, and a movie that does not encourage that isn't acceptable.  And since there are young people in my house, any content that is sexually suggestive is also a big no.  The first Nativity movie failed to meet our family's requirements.So, I was pleasantly surprised when this sequel contained much less rude content than the first, as well as a married couple rather than a man with a live-in girlfriend.  And while the first movie seemed focussed more on worldly success, the sequel addresses more important themes such as fatherhood, the true meaning of Christmas, family, and forgiveness.My dad is very choosy about movies and he's difficult to impress, but he absolutely loved this one.  This is definitely a great family film.",5,A real gem of a sequel,1386806400,"12 12, 2013",2013,1357,"['watched', 'Nativity', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'prepare', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'apprehensive', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'first', 'film', 'Not', 'acting', 'left', 'anything', 'be', 'desired', 'when', 'want', 'family', 'movie', 'are', 'certain', 'lines', 'draw', 'sand', 'two', 'biggest', 'problems', 'had', 'first', 'film', 'were:1', 'Martin', 'character', 'Mr.', 'Maddens', 'had', 'clearly', 'been', 'living', 'girlfriend', '8211', 'were', 'not', 'married', 'there', 'seemed', 'be', 'assurance', 'ever', 'would.2', 'dance', 'Mr.', 'Poppy', 'taught', 'children', 'were', 'clearly', 'sexual', 'nature.My', 'family', 'sanctity', 'marriage', 'movie', 'not', 'encourage', ""n't"", 'acceptable', 'are', 'young', 'people', 'house', 'content', 'sexually', 'suggestive', 'also', 'big', 'first', 'Nativity', 'movie', 'failed', 'meet', 'family', 'requirements.So', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'when', 'sequel', 'contained', 'much', 'less', 'rude', 'content', 'first', 'as', 'well', 'married', 'couple', 'rather', 'man', 'live-in', 'girlfriend', 'first', 'movie', 'seemed', 'focussed', 'more', 'worldly', 'success', 'sequel', 'more', 'important', 'themes', 'such', 'fatherhood', 'true', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'family', 'forgiveness.My', 'dad', 'very', 'choosy', 'movies', 'difficult', 'impress', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'one', 'definitely', 'great', 'family', 'film']",N/A
1667961,A3KE8KIXX52PQA,B00ENP2QXC,"Arlene Bradley ""arlene1999""","[3, 3]","Brilliant and funning family movie. Mr. Peterson, played brilliantly by the extraordinary David Tennant, has just moved to town and bought a new house with his very expectant wife (Joanna Page) to start a new job as a primary school teacher. The class, Mr. Peterson is to teach, has been temporarily under the control of Mr. Poppy (Marc Wooten) the class room assistant from hell. Mr. Poppy has devised a plan for the class to enter the Song for Christmas contest to be held in Wales. Mr. Poppy kidnaps Mr. Peterson, to go along with him and the children and a baby to the contest. The group gets detoured and runs out of gas, and must make their way on foot and by boat with all kinds of adventures on the way, and soul searching by Mr. Peterson on his relationship with his father, and twin brother and Mr. Poppy. When they get to the site of the contest, Mr. Peterson is confronted with his Twin, who is conducting another group and the games begin. The story is well written, the acting is brilliant, the music from the kids is extraordinary.  The ending with Mr. Peterson delivering his twin babies in a barn is sweet, and charming, and very heart warming.

All in all this sequel to Nativity is a very cute story and I liked it better then Nativity. It has nice kid's singing acts and the similarity to the real nativity at the end may be viewed as somewhat disrespectful, but it really isn't if you keep in mind you are watching a comedy and not a real depiction of the nativity.The children singers are nice to see. There is some real talent there. The bumbling teaching assistant is mostly funny, sometimes too ridiculous to be realistic. There is a competitive side to this story and hopefully this teaches that cheating is not the way to go, however that could have been made more clear in this storyline.

David Tennant does a good job playing twin brothers in the film.  A nice comedy for the holiday season.  If there is any negative points in the movie it would probably be the no restraint performance of Marc Wooton who is too over the top in this one.  Also the climbing down the mountain scene was unnecessary.  In this story the new teacher (Tennant) goes along with Mr. Poppy's decision to go against the Principal's wishes to take the children to a singing contest in Wales.

It's a good choice for family viewing, as it contains no foul language or sexual innuendos, and my 8-year old daughter actually sat in one place for the entire running time (nearly 2 hours), and laughed her head off.  David Tennant is his usual &#34;adorkable&#34; self as the beleaguered new teacher Mr. Peterson, and Marc Wooton, well, I don't really know how to describe him or his character, teaching assistant Mr. Poppy, except as maybe the love child that would result if Jack Black got together with Jim Carrey in his Ace Ventura days.Really cute rather than obnoxious kids and some fine holiday tunes round out the pleasures that this movie has to offer.
