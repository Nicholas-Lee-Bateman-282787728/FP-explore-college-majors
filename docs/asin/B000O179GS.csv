Basically, this western set is just a subset of the century collection. I would normally give this set four stars - five for content and three for value, but after all this is John Wayne! His outstanding films in any subset in which they are grouped together shouldn't suffer from a bad rating just because Paramount's home video department is clueless.",5,There's a better way to own these films,1204588800,"03 4, 2008",2008,876,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Paramount', 'released', 'collection', 'nine', 'great', 'John', 'Wayne', 'same', 'day', 'released', 'same', 'films', 'five', 'others', 'twenty-seven', 'extra', 'dollars', 'inThe', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Century', 'Collection', 'Big', 'Jake', 'Donovan', 'Reef', 'El', 'Dorado', 'Hatari', 'Hondo', 'Harm', 'Way', 'Island', 'Sky', 'McLintock', 'Rio', 'Lobo', 'High', 'Mighty', 'etc', '.The', 'five', 'additional', 'films', 'Century', 'Collection', 'are', 'Donovan', 'Reef', 'Harm', 'Way', 'Hatari', 'High', 'Mighty', '2', 'disc', 'edition', 'Island', 'Sky', 'Basically', 'western', 'set', 'just', 'subset', 'century', 'collection', 'would', 'normally', 'give', 'set', 'four', 'stars', 'five', 'content', 'three', 'value', 'John', 'Wayne', 'outstanding', 'films', 'subset', 'are', 'grouped', 'together', 'should', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'bad', 'rating', 'just', 'Paramount', 'home', 'video', 'department', 'clueless']",The John Wayne Western Collection: (The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance / True Grit / Hondo / McLintock! / Big Jake / and more)
