498576,A2PY5U9IUILU9W,B00000F4MO,,"[3, 5]","A classic of the 80's teen drama era.  This movie takes to extremes the ""kids against adults"" theme of the teen movies of the 80's.  If nothing more, this movie is HILARIOUS.  It was probably not intended so, and when I was 5 and this movie was new, I thought it was rather cool.  It's a great flick to sit around with a bunch of your friends and let off some steam with a good laugh.The premise of the film is simple.  Well, actually it isn't simple at all; making it one of the reasons this movie is so over the top.  You see, Billie Jean tries to retrive money for motorcycle repairs for her brother from the father of the boy who damaged it.  He makes unwanted advances and the impatient brother breaks into the cash register at the man's store, finds a gun and accidentally shoots the man, leading the group of friends to go into hiding.  They find their way into a wealthy house where they team up with a rich kid in a fake kidnapping ploy to get the money.  Everything escalates as the group becomes famous and infamous in television and on radio over this incident, which in real life would have ended in the kids being quickly arrested and prosecuted.Pat Benetar's ""Invincible"" is also a classic of the era, and quite fitting in the theme of the film trying too hard to be serious, and producing a comedy in its place.  Seeing Yeardley Smith before she grows up, and Christian Slater starring opposite Helen Slater (not actually related) as a blond teenager, is worth the whole package.  Peter Coyote plays the sympathetic cop.  Al from Quantum Leap and Rodney Dangerfield's son in the movie Back to School (I can't remember their names) make appearances as father and son.  If you think about it, it was really an ""all-star cast,"" or so one might have thought at the time...The last time I watched this movie with some friends, we all laughed so hard our sides hurt.The only unfortunate thing is that it is not available on DVD.",5,Five Stars for F-U-N.,1042070400,"01 9, 2003",2003,1938,"['classic', '80', 'teen', 'drama', 'era', 'movie', 'extremes', 'kids', 'adults', 'theme', 'teen', 'movies', '80', 'nothing', 'more', 'movie', 'HILARIOUS', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'intended', 'so', 'when', 'was', '5', 'movie', 'was', 'new', 'thought', 'was', 'rather', 'cool', 'great', 'flick', 'sit', 'around', 'bunch', 'friends', 'let', 'off', 'steam', 'good', 'laugh.The', 'premise', 'film', 'simple', 'Well', 'actually', ""n't"", 'simple', 'making', 'one', 'reasons', 'movie', 'so', 'top', 'see', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'retrive', 'money', 'motorcycle', 'repairs', 'brother', 'father', 'boy', 'who', 'damaged', 'unwanted', 'advances', 'impatient', 'brother', 'breaks', 'cash', 'register', 'man', 'store', 'gun', 'accidentally', 'shoots', 'man', 'leading', 'group', 'friends', 'go', 'hiding', 'find', 'way', 'wealthy', 'house', 'where', 'team', 'up', 'rich', 'kid', 'fake', 'kidnapping', 'ploy', 'get', 'money', 'Everything', 'escalates', 'group', 'famous', 'infamous', 'television', 'radio', 'incident', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'kids', 'being', 'quickly', 'arrested', 'prosecuted.Pat', 'Benetar', 'Invincible', 'also', 'classic', 'era', 'quite', 'fitting', 'theme', 'film', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'serious', 'producing', 'comedy', 'place', 'Seeing', 'Yeardley', 'Smith', 'up', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'starring', 'opposite', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'not', 'actually', 'related', 'blond', 'teenager', 'whole', 'package', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'sympathetic', 'cop', 'Al', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'son', 'movie', 'Back', 'School', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'names', 'make', 'appearances', 'father', 'son', 'think', 'was', 'really', 'all-star', 'cast', 'so', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'thought', 'time', 'last', 'time', 'watched', 'movie', 'friends', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'sides', 'hurt.The', 'only', 'unfortunate', 'thing', 'not', 'available', 'DVD']",The Legend of Billie Jean VHS
498577,AR37967IAR6ZT,B00000F4MO,,"[5, 21]","God, from Helen Slater's rebel Joan of Arc haircut to Pat Benatar's brilliant theme song ""Invincible,"" this movie is so-o-o self-righteous in its ""Don't doubt the children"" message that you'll almost forget that it's about kids fighting a man over a broken dirt bike.Basically, the movie now works as a trivia footnote. This was Yeardley Smith's biggest actual performance, before she became the ""voice of Lisa Simpson"" and did that cameo in ""As Good As It Gets."" Here she plays a mousy young girl who finds her own independence and her own short, rebellious haircut through her admiration of tortured teen-turned-media goddess Billie Jean (Slater). Also, Christian Slater, whom I don't think is actually related to Helen Slater, plays Billie Jean's troublesome-with-all-sorts-of-misguided-anger brother, whose dirt bike problems cause the whole movie to begin with. Keith Gordon, who played the guy who had the demon-possessed car in ""Christine"" and the guy with the demon-possessed father in ""Back to School,"" gave up on acting shortly after this and became a pretty good director.My biggest problem with this movie is that it loses its message in the course of showcasing misunderstood youth. By the time Billie Jean starts throwing money at people and they burn theme T-shirts of her in effigy, I was confused. Was the point that Billie Jean wasn't a heroine? Was the point that all she wanted was fair treatment and didn't get it? Are we to believe that this is the only way kids can be understood, if they go on some rampage and fake a kidnapping? What does the film say about kids in general? What underlying themes are we, as an audience, supposed to carry away from this film?The only thing it seems to conclude is that it's really cool and really rebellious to get a short haircut.",2,Fair is fair.,1041811200,"01 6, 2003",2003,1791,"['God', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'rebel', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'haircut', 'Pat', 'Benatar', 'brilliant', 'theme', 'song', 'Invincible', 'movie', 'so-o-o', 'self-righteous', 'Do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'children', 'message', ""'ll"", 'almost', 'forget', 'kids', 'fighting', 'man', 'broken', 'dirt', 'bike.Basically', 'movie', 'now', 'trivia', 'footnote', 'was', 'Yeardley', 'Smith', 'biggest', 'actual', 'performance', 'became', 'voice', 'Lisa', 'Simpson', 'did', 'cameo', 'As', 'Good', 'Here', 'mousy', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'own', 'independence', 'own', 'short', 'rebellious', 'haircut', 'admiration', 'tortured', 'teen-turned-media', 'goddess', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'Slater', 'Also', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'whom', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'actually', 'related', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'troublesome-with-all-sorts-of-misguided-anger', 'brother', 'dirt', 'bike', 'problems', 'cause', 'whole', 'movie', 'begin', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'who', 'played', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'demon-possessed', 'car', 'Christine', 'guy', 'demon-possessed', 'father', 'Back', 'School', 'gave', 'up', 'acting', 'shortly', 'became', 'pretty', 'good', 'director.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'message', 'course', 'showcasing', 'misunderstood', 'youth', 'time', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'throwing', 'money', 'people', 'burn', 'theme', 'T-shirts', 'effigy', 'was', 'confused', 'Was', 'point', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'was', ""n't"", 'heroine', 'Was', 'point', 'wanted', 'was', 'fair', 'treatment', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Are', 'believe', 'only', 'way', 'kids', 'can', 'be', 'understood', 'go', 'rampage', 'fake', 'kidnapping', 'What', 'film', 'say', 'kids', 'general', 'What', 'underlying', 'themes', 'are', 'audience', 'supposed', 'carry', 'away', 'film', 'only', 'thing', 'conclude', 'really', 'cool', 'really', 'rebellious', 'get', 'short', 'haircut']",The Legend of Billie Jean VHS

She lives in the local trailer park with her mom and her brother, Binx. The movie starts at a good pace with rocking music during which we hear a radio announcer announce how hot it is in Corpus Christi and we see Billie Jean jump on the back of Binx's motor scooter and they ride into town while being trailed by four guys in a car.Billie Jean and Binx go to swim at the lake, during which time Binx's motor scooter gets stolen by the guys who had been trailing them. That night, Binx runs off to get the bike back while Billie Jean and two trailer park neighbors Ophelia and Putter take her to the cops to report the missing bike. They get back to find the bike sitting in front of Billie Jean's trailer, destroyed. Billie Jean then goes inside the trailer and finds her brother badly beaten up. Hubey Pyatt is responsible for the trashing of both Binx and the bike.The next day Ophelia takes Binx and Billie Jean to go get the money (608 bucks) from Hubey's father to fix the motor scooter. Mr. Pyatt convinces Billie Jean to come upstairs in his tiny convenience store to get the money. Big mistake...Mr.Pyatt says Billie Jean will have to sleep with him in order to keep receiving the 608 dollars...giving only 50 bucks for each of his ""sex lessons"". Billie Jean escapes from his strong hold and runs downstairs where Binx and Ophelia are waiting..with a gun.Binx accidentally shoots Mr.Pyatt in the shoulder which spells TROUBLE for he and his sister. Ophelia drives back to the trailer park so that Billie Jean and Binx can get their stuff...they are officially on the run from the cops. Putter, the annoying, yet lively, friend wants to come too...even though she had nothing to do with the incident. She goes with them. The four friends set out on a quest for justice.There are several high energy scenes in the show, which anybody can love:~Billie Jean and Binx running into their trailer and packing up their stuff.~Billie Jean cutting her hair...probably the most important scene from the whole movie.~Putter getting her period.

They are legitimate dvds & come in a dvd case, with a picture of Billie Jean on the front of the case, & more cover art on the back of the dvd case. Also, on the actual dvd disc, they have the the ""DVD Video"" Logo, and the ""Dolby Digital"" Logo. Also on the actual dvd, it has the Title ""The Legend of Billie Jean"". However, unfortunately, there are also, some dvds of this movie, that are ""amateur rip-offs"", that come with only a dvd disc, mailed in an envelope, with no dvd case what so ever. There have been a lot of negative reviews of this dvd, however there are some good quality DVDS, well worth having of this product. The good ones have scene selections on the menu, and they're full screen.So, in conclusion, I have had a lot of experience with this movie by ordering from various websites, other than amazon, and some of these, both good and bad, sometimes make their way into amazon, via 3rd party sellers. What I would advise, is when one becomes available from an Amazon 3rd party seller, judge it on an individual basis. If the seller describes it as coming in a dvd case, with a picture of Billie Jean on the front, more art work on the back of the dvd case, and with the actual dvd disc having the ""DVD Video"" Logo, & the ""Dolby Digital"" Logo, and the title ""The Legend of Billie Jean"" printed on the disc, them it should be a good decent dvd. Also, make sure the seller states it is a Region 1 (U.S.A.) DVD. However, if the seller does not give a full description, with the things I have mentioned, then BEWARE, it may be a ""rip-off"".Also, the good, decent dvds that I have described ot ""The Legend of Billie Jean"" DVD, are probably professionally, manufactured, reproductions of the VHS version. But, they have been reproduced, extremely well, and there is no notable difference between a  professionlly, manufactured, VHS  reproduction dvd, from an orginal manufactured dvd. As another reviewer pointed out, these companies have been granted a ""License"", to legally do so.So, these good, decent dvds that I have described are the BEST OPTION AVAILABLE, for this classic move. They are definitely better than a VHS, for sure. I hope this clears up the confusion, of this classic, well sought after, hard to find, dvd. I hope this information has been helpful.

When it showed here, it was pretty wild to see your friends up on the big screen in the background as extras.  The dude selling the t-shirts on the beach - I knew that guy and they got some other guy to dub his voice.  Very weird to hear that voice come out of his mouth.  I auditioned as an extra but it required me missing school a day or two and my mom wouldn't have any of it.  Great music throughout, esp. Pat Benatar's ""Invincible"".  A lot of the area the movie shows is no longer around such as the amusement park and the abandoned mini-golf.  The surf shop, though, where it all begins, is still in business.  I think I read one of the synopsis that says Billie Jean and her friends cruise around the state.  I don't remember that. It seemed they stayed in Corpus Christi the whole time, just one step ahead of the law.  I think one of the stars in the movie now does Lisa Simpson's voice on The Simpsons - she's the comic relief in this movie and is really good in it.  She has a terrific scene with her mother and a pair of scissors.

498613,A29G5EPQLSY06G,B00000F4MO,Ron Heck,"[4, 5]","Sure, it's a manufactured on demand DVD, with somewhat generic cover art and you'll never see it available in stores, but it's a real legitimate non-bootleg copy of The Legend of Billie Jean made by Warner Archive.  If you're ordering directly from amazon, this is not the same ripped-from-VHS version that's discussed in the other reviews.  It's the real deal.  For starters, it's 16 x 9 and widescreen and it has audio commentary.  It's the only feature and it's accessible through a really generic menu screen, but it's there.  You're not going to get any profound insights from it, but Yeardley Smith is charming as always (as she is on the Simpsons DVD commentaries), while Helen Slater provides a little background on the development of the film that I hadn't heard anywhere else.  The picture quality is surprisingly pretty solid.  I saw this in HD on cable awhile back, and while this may not have the bold presence of high definition, I'd go so far as to say that it's slightly better than version I saw broadcasted.  The colors on this DVD are much warmer and richer, and I distinctly remember weird artifacts and damage to the print on the HD one that are simply not present here.  There's a thin layer of 80s film grain to it, giving a nice gritty touch to it that it couldn't have had on my old betamax tape.  If you are looking for flaws, there is a strange very very thin colored bar on the right side of the frame from time to time.  Could possibly be my player, even.  You wouldn't have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out to you, but now you will.  And the sound is 2 channel stereo, as it should be.  However, all previous music licensing concerns are irrelevant because every song is in tact on this release.So with all the technical stuff out of the way, I guess I'll describe the movie to the few people reading this who don't know.  The Legend of Billie Jean is the story of a group of well meaning teenagers in Texas who accidentally become outlaws with a growing fame fueled by the local media.  Think something somewhat along the lines of a lighter and more feminine version of The Warriors.  It's got a rocking 80s soundtrack, oddball 80s fashion, and wonderfully over the top Southern accents.  It's not a ""so bad it's good movie,"" but it makes me giggle nonstop for it's entire runtime - sometimes intentionally, sometimes not.  Almost everything Yeardley Smith's character says is a riot.  It's my personal Rocky Horror Picture Show and it makes me want to dress up like the characters, yell at the screen, and quote its dialog.  I can't say that if you haven't caught this movie at a young age that you can still be indoctrinated into the Billie Jean cult.  It may just be for the already converted, but this DVD is much appreciated.",4,"Finally, an Official DVD Release",1320796800,"11 9, 2011",2011,2766,"['Sure', 'manufactured', 'demand', 'DVD', 'somewhat', 'generic', 'cover', 'art', ""'ll"", 'never', 'see', 'available', 'stores', 'real', 'legitimate', 'non-bootleg', 'copy', 'Legend', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'made', 'Warner', 'Archive', ""'re"", 'ordering', 'directly', 'amazon', 'not', 'same', 'ripped-from-VHS', 'version', 'discussed', 'other', 'reviews', 'real', 'deal', 'starters', '16', 'x', '9', 'widescreen', 'audio', 'commentary', 'only', 'feature', 'accessible', 'really', 'generic', 'menu', 'screen', 'there', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'profound', 'insights', 'Yeardley', 'Smith', 'charming', 'always', 'Simpsons', 'DVD', 'commentaries', 'Helen', 'Slater', 'little', 'background', 'development', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'anywhere', 'else', 'picture', 'quality', 'surprisingly', 'pretty', 'solid', 'saw', 'HD', 'cable', 'awhile', 'back', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'bold', 'presence', 'high', 'definition', ""'d"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'slightly', 'better', 'version', 'saw', 'broadcasted', 'colors', 'DVD', 'are', 'much', 'warmer', 'richer', 'distinctly', 'remember', 'weird', 'artifacts', 'damage', 'print', 'HD', 'one', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'present', 'here', 'thin', 'layer', '80s', 'film', 'grain', 'giving', 'nice', 'gritty', 'touch', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'old', 'betamax', 'tape', 'are', 'looking', 'flaws', 'strange', 'very', 'very', 'thin', 'colored', 'bar', 'right', 'side', 'frame', 'time', 'time', 'Could', 'possibly', 'be', 'player', 'even', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'noticed', 'had', ""n't"", 'pointed', 'now', 'will', 'sound', '2', 'channel', 'stereo', 'should', 'be', 'However', 'previous', 'music', 'licensing', 'concerns', 'are', 'irrelevant', 'song', 'tact', 'release.So', 'technical', 'stuff', 'way', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'describe', 'movie', 'few', 'people', 'reading', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Legend', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'story', 'group', 'well', 'meaning', 'teenagers', 'Texas', 'who', 'accidentally', 'become', 'outlaws', 'growing', 'fame', 'fueled', 'local', 'media', 'Think', 'something', 'somewhat', 'lines', 'lighter', 'more', 'feminine', 'version', 'Warriors', 'got', 'rocking', '80s', 'soundtrack', 'oddball', '80s', 'fashion', 'wonderfully', 'top', 'Southern', 'accents', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'movie', 'giggle', 'nonstop', 'entire', 'runtime', 'sometimes', 'intentionally', 'sometimes', 'not', 'Almost', 'everything', 'Yeardley', 'Smith', 'character', 'riot', 'personal', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', 'want', 'dress', 'up', 'characters', 'yell', 'screen', 'quote', 'dialog', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'caught', 'movie', 'young', 'age', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'indoctrinated', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'cult', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'already', 'converted', 'DVD', 'much', 'appreciated']",The Legend of Billie Jean VHS

But watch this movie and then the classic &quot;gal-pal&quot; movie &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot;.  The similarities are striking -- and this one came first.  I particularly like Peter Coyote as the tortured policeman who keeps trying to bring the story to a close before things get out of  hand.
