1548231,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00883OY7G,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Woman In the Fifth is *not* a suspense, so if you see it sitting in the suspense section of your local Walmart or perhaps the one of many suspense lists you sometimes see on the left side of amazon's page, please be beware.  This is, at least, a low budget mystery film that wanders aimlessly.  Well, it begins on a promising and somwhat interesting note- an American writer (played by Ethan Hawke) visits Paris in the hopes of reuniting with his ex-wife and young daughter, however the woman welcomes Ethan on a less than enthusiastic note with a phone call to the police.  Soon he's out on the streets with the cops chasing him.  This scene ends WAY too abruptly, I'm afraid.So far so good.  Even better- while taking a quick nap, his things are stolen on a bus ride (or train ride, I can't remember) so he has nothing left... in a foreign country.  This is one really crappy situation to find yourself in, but luckily Ethan knows French so he eventually ends up in a diner/restaurant where someone there can let him stay in a room for free!  A twist of good luck!  Well, the catch is, he has to work security 6 hours a day watching cameras in a tiny room, just in case any trespassers or criminals were to break in.  Well the good news is that he's a writer, so he can pass the time writing.  So far, for every bad things he experiences, a touch of good fortune comes along.After a meet up at a library, the librarian invites Ethan to a meeting of ""kindred spirits"" (other writers who he can associate with) and... he takes up the invitation, arrives and meets a mysterious older woman.  From here... nothing really noteworthy happens for the next 30 minutes.  The occasional romantic scene with this woman, along with romance involving another younger woman he met at the diner earlier, but that's about it.  My goodness is this dreadfully boring material!  Save me from this massacre!  But don't fret, because it's about to pick up temporarily.  I won't say who dies and how it happens (hey wait, do we even *know* who the killer is?) but a murder scene later on is probably the only noteworthy part of the entire film.  If not for this segment, a 1-star rating would be considered generous.There's a twist involving the woman he meets at the party earlier, but trust me, it's extremely undramatic and terrible.  There's another twist with his young daughter, but... it's equally undramatic and terrible.  The overall presentation is overblown and fake looking resembling a play, so guys probably won't like this stuff.  I'm glad I don't have to sit through this movie ever again.  Well, unless I'm threatened to do so but I can fight, darn it, so you can't physically make me!  Alright I can't fight.  I can't tell a lie, and I'm not lying when I say this film is a dud.  Oh and 80% of the time you'll be reading subtitles on the bottom of the screen, unless you can understand French.",1,worst french vacation ever,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,2891,"['Woman', 'Fifth', '*not*', 'suspense', 'so', 'see', 'sitting', 'suspense', 'section', 'local', 'Walmart', 'perhaps', 'one', 'many', 'suspense', 'lists', 'sometimes', 'see', 'left', 'side', 'amazon', 'page', 'please', 'be', 'beware', 'least', 'low', 'budget', 'mystery', 'film', 'aimlessly', 'Well', 'promising', 'somwhat', 'interesting', 'note-', 'American', 'writer', 'played', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Paris', 'hopes', 'reuniting', 'ex-wife', 'young', 'daughter', 'however', 'woman', 'Ethan', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'note', 'phone', 'call', 'police', 'Soon', 'out', 'streets', 'cops', 'chasing', 'scene', 'WAY', 'too', 'abruptly', ""'m"", 'afraid.So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'Even', 'better-', 'taking', 'quick', 'nap', 'things', 'are', 'stolen', 'bus', 'ride', 'train', 'ride', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'so', 'nothing', 'left', 'foreign', 'country', 'one', 'really', 'crappy', 'situation', 'find', 'luckily', 'Ethan', 'French', 'eventually', 'up', 'diner/restaurant', 'where', 'someone', 'there', 'can', 'let', 'stay', 'room', 'free', 'twist', 'good', 'luck', 'Well', 'catch', 'work', 'security', '6', 'hours', 'day', 'watching', 'cameras', 'tiny', 'room', 'just', 'case', 'trespassers', 'criminals', 'were', 'break', 'good', 'news', 'writer', 'can', 'pass', 'time', 'writing', 'So', 'far', 'bad', 'things', 'touch', 'good', 'fortune', 'along.After', 'meet', 'up', 'library', 'librarian', 'invites', 'Ethan', 'meeting', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'other', 'writers', 'who', 'can', 'associate', 'up', 'invitation', 'arrives', 'mysterious', 'older', 'woman', 'here', 'nothing', 'really', 'noteworthy', 'happens', 'next', '30', 'minutes', 'occasional', 'romantic', 'scene', 'woman', 'romance', 'involving', 'younger', 'woman', 'met', 'diner', 'earlier', 'goodness', 'dreadfully', 'boring', 'material', 'Save', 'massacre', 'do', ""n't"", 'fret', 'pick', 'up', 'temporarily', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'who', 'how', 'hey', 'wait', 'do', 'even', '*know*', 'who', 'killer', 'murder', 'scene', 'later', 'probably', 'only', 'noteworthy', 'part', 'entire', 'film', 'not', 'segment', '1-star', 'rating', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'twist', 'involving', 'woman', 'party', 'earlier', 'extremely', 'undramatic', 'terrible', 'twist', 'young', 'daughter', 'equally', 'undramatic', 'terrible', 'overall', 'presentation', 'overblown', 'fake', 'looking', 'resembling', 'play', 'guys', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'stuff', ""'m"", 'glad', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sit', 'movie', 'ever', 'again', 'Well', ""'m"", 'threatened', 'do', 'so', 'can', 'fight', 'darn', 'ca', ""n't"", 'physically', 'make', 'Alright', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fight', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'lie', ""'m"", 'not', 'lying', 'when', 'say', 'film', 'dud', 'Oh', '80', '%', 'time', ""'ll"", 'be', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'bottom', 'screen', 'can', 'understand', 'French']",The Woman in the Fifth

1548238,A3BWP965RIWBCU,B00883OY7G,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[0, 0]","&#34;Woman in the Fifth&#34; (Mongrel DVD-4857 being the North American edition which I acquired) is a strange and unsettling film which opens question upon perplexing question in the viewer's mind and resolves nothing, even at the end. My &#34;take&#34; is that Margit, one of the novelist's two lovers, who, it turns out, had died a decade and an half before the time of the action portrayed even begins, somehow has drawn the protagonist into another realm of time and being, suspended between present and past. Having come to Paris to be near the daughter of his marriage with a wife now estranged, divorced, the writer, depending on one's perception, either sinks into a shadow life of mental illness or into the realm of the esoteric and occult, although he does not realise how fully until the film's d&eacute;nouement of the various strands of his life and those of others among the cast. Ethan Hawke as the writer is bewildered, sad, and yet at times impetuously sexy despite the pervasive gloom of his moodiness, frustration, and torment.Some find the motion picture chaotic and disorganised. I disagree about that. The film is wonderfully artistic, and, weird and it turns out more and more to be as its action proceeds, there is a clear line, one that is artistic and intuitive, from beginning to end, though not one that is susceptible to logical explanation and analysis. There are no extra features included, either, at least in the DVD as I found it, to help to shed some light on the film's tantalisingly unresolved mysteries or regarding what prompted the movie's creators to produce what they did. The film is just its own, by turns grungy, sensuously bittersweet, and rather nightmarishly peculiar self, a wondrously odd work of art. It is not, however, for those who regard as essential a tight movie plot and straightforward path to a clear conclusion!",4,"Not Confused or Messy, but, Rather, Wonderfully Evocative and Mysterious",1396310400,"04 1, 2014",2014,1874,"['34', 'Woman', 'Fifth', '34', 'Mongrel', 'DVD-4857', 'being', 'North', 'American', 'edition', 'acquired', 'strange', 'unsettling', 'film', 'question', 'perplexing', 'question', 'viewer', 'mind', 'nothing', 'even', 'end', 'My', '34', 'take', '34', 'Margit', 'one', 'novelist', 'two', 'lovers', 'who', 'out', 'had', 'died', 'decade', 'half', 'time', 'action', 'portrayed', 'even', 'begins', 'somehow', 'drawn', 'protagonist', 'realm', 'time', 'being', 'suspended', 'present', 'past', 'Having', 'come', 'Paris', 'be', 'daughter', 'marriage', 'wife', 'now', 'estranged', 'divorced', 'writer', 'depending', 'one', 'perception', 'sinks', 'shadow', 'life', 'mental', 'illness', 'realm', 'esoteric', 'occult', 'not', 'realise', 'how', 'fully', 'film', 'd', 'eacute', 'nouement', 'various', 'strands', 'life', 'others', 'cast', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'writer', 'bewildered', 'sad', 'yet', 'times', 'impetuously', 'sexy', 'pervasive', 'gloom', 'moodiness', 'frustration', 'torment.Some', 'find', 'motion', 'picture', 'chaotic', 'disorganised', 'disagree', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'artistic', 'weird', 'out', 'more', 'more', 'be', 'action', 'proceeds', 'clear', 'line', 'one', 'artistic', 'intuitive', 'beginning', 'end', 'not', 'one', 'susceptible', 'logical', 'explanation', 'analysis', 'are', 'extra', 'features', 'included', 'either', 'least', 'DVD', 'found', 'help', 'shed', 'light', 'film', 'tantalisingly', 'unresolved', 'mysteries', 'regarding', 'prompted', 'movie', 'creators', 'produce', 'what', 'did', 'film', 'just', 'own', 'turns', 'grungy', 'sensuously', 'bittersweet', 'rather', 'nightmarishly', 'peculiar', 'self', 'wondrously', 'odd', 'work', 'art', 'not', 'however', 'who', 'regard', 'essential', 'tight', 'movie', 'plot', 'straightforward', 'path', 'clear', 'conclusion']",The Woman in the Fifth
1548239,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00883OY7G,Grady Harp,"[14, 20]","Douglas Kennedy's perplexing novel THE WOMAN IN THE FIFTH has been further contorted by writer/director Pawel Pawlikowski for the film of the same name (aka La femme du V&egrave;me).  If the viewer has read the novel then the confusion of the story will not be as surprising as it is to the novice viewer. In many ways this is a brilliant cinematic exploration of the fragility of the human mind, how events of the past can influence the manner in which we attempt to reconstruct a viable present.  But in other ways this is a film that refuses to tell a story that is logical and will leave many viewers with some serious head scratching by movie's end.Academic professor of literature and writer Tom Hicks (Ethan Hawke) seems to be fleeing America in the wake of a scandal simply because he wants to see his six-year-old daughter Chlo&eacute; (Julie Papillon): Tom's estranged wife Nathalie (Delphine Chuillot) refuses to let Tom see his daughter, has a restraining order in place and seems fearful of Tom's character (it is suggested that Tom may have been in prison for the past six years). The police are called and Tom escapes onto a bus, falls asleep and s awakened at the end of the line having been robbed of this luggage and money.  He is in the sleazy part of Paris inhabited by North Africans and Moroccans and finds a degree of solace in a tiny caf&eacute;, the beautiful Polish waitress Ania (Joanna Kulig) offers him coffee and introduces him to the owner, Sezer (Samir Guesmi) who allows him to room in the filthy place, an offer that is accompanied by a `job' where he will be a night watchman in a warehouse visited by shadowy figures who must give a code for Tom to allow entry. Tom uses his night jobsite to write lengthy letters to Chlo&eacute; and spends his days spying on her at her school. At a bookstore he meets a fellow American who invites him to an evening reception for writers and there he encounters the very strange Margit (Kristin Scott Thomas), a bewitching but enigmatic widow of a Hungarian writer who is obviously attracted to Tom and sets meeting times and places for them to engage in a tryst (in the Fifth Arrondissement). Tom and Margit begin a tempestuous physical affair but at the same time Tom and Ania have an equally passionate affair and there is always in the background Tom's obsession to reunite with his daughter. But the story implodes with a murder, a disappearance, and a very strange change in the veracity of Margit's existence. It is at this point that the film becomes purposefully deranged and bizarre and the audience is left with merely some ideas and clues as to what has really happened. How are these incongruous events to make sense? Can they make sense? Is Tom succumbing to the same fever that kept him sheltered for many days upon his arrival in beautiful Paris? Has time somehow passed him by or is he living in an even grander deceit than he first thought?The film is basically in French with English subtitles.  Ethan Hawke struggle with the French but that is credible for a `just arrived' American. Kristin Scott Thomas offers her usual excellent skills as the strange Margit and the remainder of the cast do well with what little dialogue they are given. The dank atmospheric cinematography is by Ryszard Lenczewski and the correctly strange musical score (from an aria form a Handel opera sung by a countertenor to piano music excerpts form the Romantic era) is the work of Max de Wardener. Pawel Pawlikowski`s moody, menacing, downbeat film takes something from the director's Polish compatriots Polanski and Kieslowski. It is offbeat but for those who appreciate experimental cinema this is well worth your time.

This film received a good review from Roger Ebert, so we watched it. (On Netflix)This is the dreariest film I've seen in years. The acting is good, but the story has no real structure and becomes increasingly bewildering as the movie proceeds. Ethan Hawke seems to be existing in a parallel universe, and suffering from some sort of mental illness. He is supposedly in Paris to see his daughter, but aside from peering at her through a fence once or twice, nothing further develops. Hawke's character lives in a seamy squalid room above an equally dismal coffee shop, weird things happen that have no explanation, he is given a weird job monitoring a screen in what seems to be a bunker of sorts where strange things may or may not be occuring, Kristen Scott Thomas's character is apparently a figment of his imagination... It just gets less and less interesting and there is not a single moment of normalcy. Everyone is weird.

1548242,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00883OY7G,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 7]","""The Woman in the Fifth"" is something of an interesting international hybrid.  Set in Paris, this presentation was actually a British and Polish co-production and stars an American actor in the leading role.  How's that for diversity?  Writer/director Pawel Pawlikowski has assembled an intriguing chamber piece that relies more on mood than on storytelling.  There are many different ways to describe the film, but it's hard to discuss the movie in-depth without revealing too much.  Branded by a blurb on the DVD cover as a ""cool, creepy psychological thriller"" by Time magazine, I'm not certain that is how I'd position the film for a mass audience.  While the experience surely does create an unsettling vibe, it may be too low-key to be fully embraced as a thriller.  At best, I'd call it an atmospheric character study.  There is a lot to recommend ""The Woman in the Fifth"" (including one of Ethan Hawke's most compelling performances), but ultimately it is an experience that connected more with my mind than with my heart.  And this lack of emotional investment on my part makes my ultimate recommendation rather tepid.Hawke plays an American writer in Paris trying to reconnect with his estranged wife and child.  The road to redemption and happiness, however, is never easy and Hawke finds himself in a dingy hotel surrounded by a rather unsavory criminal element.  As he is drawn into more dire situations, he finds possible solace in the arms of a mysterious stranger (the always welcome Kristin Scott Thomas).  As the two grow closer and Hawke attempts to prevent his life from spiraling out of control, you don't initially see how important she will become.  It's probably best, for the sake of discretion, to leave the description there.  If you have read about the movie at all, it should be apparent that maybe not everything is as it seems.  And Pawlikowski paints a pretty bleak portrait.  Is Hawke a salvageable character?  And what influence does Scott Thomas exert over him?  Can he rebuild his life or will it continue to slide downward?I think it's fair to say that not all of the answers will be provided.  The movie can probably be interpreted in different ways by different viewers.  And while I enjoyed the enigmatic nature of the screenplay, it was more of a intellectual experiment that a visceral experience.  Sometimes that works for a picture.  But after creating a fully realized leading character, I just really wanted to be more emotionally connected to his journey.  It's not Hawke's fault.  In fact. I think this may be one of his stronger roles.  Teetering at the brink of madness and desperation, his unpredictability is one of the story's most fascinating aspects.  Ultimately, I admired much of ""The Woman in the Fifth"" while I was watching it.  That said, it is also not a movie that I'll revisit very often if ever.  Well made, but not very fulfilling (for me), I'd definitely check this out if you are a Hawke fan.  Otherwise, don't let the thriller description throw you.  This is a contemplative character study for patient audiences.  About 3 1/2 stars.

1548245,A2D5FK0NKOFWNJ,B00883OY7G,"Orson Welles ""Hollywood""","[0, 0]","I was quickly amazed by the excellence and originality of the cinematography and editing (starting with the shot of an airplane landing after the opening credits have ended.  The film begins with soft focus shots of a forest, and similar shots recur later in the movie). I then was caught up in the director's extensive and original use of soft focus shots to advance intriguing, immediately mysterious plot.  For example, when Ethan Hawke goes through customs, there is a shot of the customs officer in focus while Hawke, shot from behind, is out of focus.  In the next, reverse shot, we still see the officer, no w in the foreground in focus, and when Hawke responds to his question, he stays out of focus; the camera does rack to bring him into focus when he talks, s Hollywood cinematographers conventionally do.  Some shots are 90 precent soft focus (blurred).  The plot itself--involving a domestic dispute over an American father's lack of visitation rights to see his six year old French daughter is is an effective device for launching the mystery--what did the father do to lose his wife and his child?  WHy does he have writer's block? Was he in prison, or only in a  hospital?  Was it a mental hospital?  But the film gains its power from the way it is shot and edited.  The acting, dialogue, and directing are first rate.  In my view, the Woman in the Fifth is a vastly underrated film.  I just want to testify as a cinephile fond of thrillers that Woman in the Fifth is a worthy success to thrillers by Hitchcock, de Palma (Woman in the Fifth calls to my mind his films involving doubles), Pakula, and Polanski (Woman in the Fifth especially reminds me of The Tenant, and there are echoes of Polanski's less successful film, Frantic), among others.

1548247,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B00883OY7G,"Promise ""promise""","[4, 6]","There is a lot to like about this film.  The mood--the style!  Much of the film is set in a dreadfully depressing part of Paris that is almost painful to see.  And yet there are moments that are almost lovely. There is a scene near the end in the Arab's cafe, with an old man sitting alone at a table, all in shades of deep blues and grays that reminded me of some of Picasso's painting in his blue period.  Then the camera moves back to include the kitchen area where the pretty blond Polish girl is working, a square of light in the darkness that reminded me of Edward Hopper.  There are some other strangely lovely scenes too --the writer and the Polish girl, lit up by the midday sun in the grass, making love.  Then the camera again pulls back and we see that they are not in a sweet country meadow, but only a few feet from a train track in an ugly slum.There's another great scene, too, of a rooftop apartment right near the base of the Eiffel Tower.  I've seen the Eiffel Tower from many angles but never in such a striking way as this.  That is the setting for the encounter of the writer with the other woman in his life...the Woman in the Fifth.There is a lot to remind an American viewer of Hitchcock films, such as these interesting settings but mostly the sheer scariness of it.  I found myself yelling at the screen, ""Don't go there!"" when our writer/hero entered the hallway of the really creepy place where he was working to investigate strange screams.Unfortunately the poor guy went a lot of places where a more sensible man would have avoided.  Maybe, as the Woman in the Fifth suggested, it was good for his work.  We'll never know because, about two thirds of the way through the film an unexpected element is introduced that, as other viewers have said, caused one to do some serious head scratching.I read all of the reviews here to give me a sense of what went on and then I went to reviews of the book, which were actually much more helpful.  I don't want to give away anything to potential viewers, only to say that ""it"" didn't work for me.  This was part of the novel and apparently it didn't work for a number of readers either.  This kind of twist can work if it's done right but it wasn't done well in this film, anyway, and it caused me to stop caring about any of the characters.  Too bad because there was great tension and interest built up in the first part of the film.  Ethan Hawke did a very good job of portraying this intelligent and attractive man who was obviously having a horrific time.  He was credible and likable and we cared about him.  Well I won't say any more about what happens.The film is visually appealing and the characters are intriguing and we see a part of Paris that, thank God, most tourists don't see.  The music is great, the love scenes are mostly nice, the acting is first rate all around. Kristen Scott Thomas is always good, the young woman who plays the Polish girl is wonderful.  But it's not a film I'd ever watch again nor would I recommend it wholeheartedly.  It's not quite dark enough to qualify as a film noir and it's not realistic enough to be a thriller and it's not supernatural enough to be a sheer fantasy.

1548252,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00883OY7G,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[4, 4]","Tom Ricks (Ethan Hawke) is an American novelist who goes to Paris in hopes of patching up his relationship with his ex-wife (Delphine Chuillot) and daughter (Julie Papillon). She wants nothing to do with him because of some event in their past, which is not fully explained. Through a series of bad luck he ends up working for a man named Sezer (Samir Guesmi) as a night time doorman, a job steeped with symbolism as he works on his second novel.Meanwhile, Tom meets a mysterious older woman (Kristin Scott Thomas) who has taken a shine to him. She is the ""Woman in the Fifth."" He begins an affair with her about the same time he takes up with Sezer's girlfriend, his ""Polish muse"" (Joanna Kulig). We don't know how weird things really are until near the end of the tale.If I told you I understood everything in this film, I would be lying. There is symbolism in his forest writing, the bugs, and the light which dims and goes bright, none of which I fully understood. Then there is the weird aspect of the movie which turns this into an existential film, something I didn't fully comprehend. I didn't think it was worth watching a second time through in an attempt to make heads or tails out of the film.This is an artsy film. It is in part in English and French with subtitles, and Polish with no subtitles. The action moves slow as it concentrates on the character of Tom Ricks.

1548253,ASFNTI8NRNRR0,B00883OY7G,The OC,"[1, 2]","Innocently looking thru the amazon video collection I chose to watch this movie only because Kristen Scott-Thomas, one of my favorites, was in it.  For the first 24 minutes I watched Ethan Hawkes character go from one bad decision to another.  I didn't like this bumbling intellectual writer.  After he has made an inept attempt to see his child at his ex-wife's home in Paris, nearly gets arrested, loses his luggage and money, winds up giving his passport to a seedy hotel owner who later gives him a mysterious job, I was ready to depart. But I waited for Kristen to appear in the 25th minute.  Disgust began to move to curiosity and an appreciation for Hawke's acting and the growing mystery of the story.  I wished I had not rushed to so many judgments at the beginning.  (How many times and ways have I done that).  But I was confused by the end and it haunted me.  I didn't have the benefit of reading the book but that may not have helped as the director's script is apparently not an exact match.So I decided to watch it again a few days later. I certainly didn't come up with definite answers but I tried to pay more attention to details.  The ""magical forest"" of his first novel.  Kristen's line ""You don't know what you are capable of.""  The statements to his daughter in the long letter he wrote to her, ""Don't be upset if you don't see me again."" and ""I must shield you from the darkness in me.""  Kristen's advice, ""Forget your wife and daughter."" Is he a killer?  Will he construct another novel from his ""experiences"" with Kristen's character and the content of the long, long letter that he originally intended for his daughter?  Or will he soon just crash and burn. The Hawkes character is not particularly sympathetic even though he is obviously broken and suffering.  He doesn't generate much of an emotional response.  So the positive aspects of the movie are the acting, directing and mysterious script. Don't watch it if you are looking for the feel good or the familiar or the tidy ending.",4,I thought watching it again might help.,1354924800,"12 8, 2012",2012,2013,"['Innocently', 'looking', 'amazon', 'video', 'collection', 'chose', 'watch', 'movie', 'only', 'Kristen', 'Scott-Thomas', 'one', 'favorites', 'was', 'first', '24', 'minutes', 'watched', 'Ethan', 'Hawkes', 'character', 'go', 'one', 'bad', 'decision', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'bumbling', 'intellectual', 'writer', 'made', 'inept', 'attempt', 'see', 'child', 'ex-wife', 'home', 'Paris', 'nearly', 'arrested', 'luggage', 'money', 'up', 'giving', 'passport', 'seedy', 'hotel', 'owner', 'who', 'later', 'mysterious', 'job', 'was', 'ready', 'depart', 'waited', 'Kristen', 'appear', '25th', 'minute', 'Disgust', 'began', 'move', 'curiosity', 'appreciation', 'Hawke', 'acting', 'growing', 'mystery', 'story', 'wished', 'had', 'not', 'rushed', 'so', 'many', 'judgments', 'beginning', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'ways', 'have', 'done', 'was', 'confused', 'end', 'haunted', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'benefit', 'reading', 'book', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'helped', 'director', 'script', 'apparently', 'not', 'exact', 'match.So', 'decided', 'watch', 'again', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'definite', 'answers', 'tried', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'details', 'magical', 'forest', 'first', 'novel', 'Kristen', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'are', 'capable', 'statements', 'daughter', 'long', 'letter', 'wrote', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'upset', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'again', 'must', 'shield', 'darkness', 'Kristen', 'advice', 'Forget', 'wife', 'daughter', 'killer', 'Will', 'construct', 'novel', 'experiences', 'Kristen', 'character', 'content', 'long', 'long', 'letter', 'originally', 'intended', 'daughter', 'will', 'soon', 'just', 'crash', 'burn', 'Hawkes', 'character', 'not', 'particularly', 'sympathetic', 'even', 'obviously', 'broken', 'suffering', ""n't"", 'generate', 'much', 'emotional', 'response', 'positive', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', 'acting', 'directing', 'mysterious', 'script', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'are', 'looking', 'feel', 'good', 'familiar', 'tidy', 'ending']",The Woman in the Fifth
1548254,AB1CKA6B849SP,B00883OY7G,zeus,"[3, 5]","A lot of questions remain unanswered in this movie. Really good movie with great acting but still needs more development. I know that the point of the movie is to show the fragile human mind, but let's get some answers. Don't be lazy and leave everything to the viewers.Tom Ricks (not Harry as stated in the back of the blu ray box) arrives in Paris to visit his daughter that lives with his estranged wife. He loses all his stuff and ends living in a dump in Paris. He gets a ""job"" provided to him by the owner of his room and then he meets a mysterious woman that knows everything about him and waits for his phone call ONLY. Then the movie takes a bizarre turn that has the potential of a good thriller, but then the movie suddenly ends.Of course we can put the pieces together and we understand that he was in the psychiatric ward back here in the US because he is psychotic, but I personally needed some answers. Like what is exactly is he guarding every night for six hours? Why the Arab owner, who is part of the mafia, was captured? Doesn't make any sense. These people are really protected and they don't do the dirty work by temselves. How does he know the mysterious lady? Did anybody tell him about her? And so on.....Maybe the book is better. I will read it. But the movie had potential and could be about 20 minutes longer.Three stars only because of the movie as is and the great acting of all participants (...even Tom's unpleasant neighbor who doesn't flush).",3,Huh?
