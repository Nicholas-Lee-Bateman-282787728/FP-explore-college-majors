Early to mid 70s sci-fi on TVfrankly sucked. This was much more interesting then most of what I remember watching back then. The DVD is broken into two stories.The first story of the clone colony was fair. Dated. It seemed to have borrowed from ""Zardoz"" a bit. The second story of the animal preserve was more interesting. Seemed more original then the first story. If tried today as a series, who knows. Maybe two sesaons. I liked it enough to keep on the shelf.

1355201,A1H0DVDALK4APZ,B003NH3X5Q,Darrell A. Lane,"[0, 0]","I think the movie should have spent forty to fifty minutes on the astronauts' reactions to waking up two centuries later and their experiences in returning to Hollywood's agricultural fantasy Earth that plagued sci fi in the 70's. This movie IS a composite of two episodes, one about devolving intellects thru the miracle of cloning (not a bad concept but demanding of its own movie), and the second is about game wardens turned religious zealots (a striking parallel to today's government obsessed with using an environmental iron fist to control individual behavior; or global warmers turned religious nutjobs, just replace the nature of your god and rule the world...bwa-ha-ha-ha!).Dumbest scene is when our female star gets weepy-eyed and sets a baby goat free from a trap and then gets defensive when the psycho game wardens accuse her of poaching (and for some reason throw her into a makeshift cage, naked and scared); though I appreciate the feelings the character had in trying to rescue a defenseless animal, it is the high point of human conceit and intellectual bankruptcy to come into someone else's house (or game preserve), fiddle around until things are to YOUR liking and not expect reprisal equal to or greater than your actions. Every action has an equal but opposite reaction and nature still rules by survival of the fittest. Environmentalist seem to miss this simple equation and even simpler law on conservation. Maybe its an inconvenient truth they choose not to accept. It makes me laugh even more while I write this.Now, eating goats? Yuck.Anyhoo, it stars John Saxon, oen year after Planet Earth (the superior movie), five years before Battle Beyond the Stars, eight years before A Nightmare on Elm Street and eleven years before Prisoners of the Lost Universe; Saxon's personality commands screen time.",3,Least of the three but still entertaining,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",2012,1830,"['think', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'spent', 'forty', 'fifty', 'minutes', 'astronauts', 'reactions', 'waking', 'up', 'two', 'centuries', 'later', 'experiences', 'returning', 'Hollywood', 'agricultural', 'fantasy', 'Earth', 'plagued', 'sci', 'fi', '70', 'movie', 'composite', 'two', 'episodes', 'one', 'devolving', 'intellects', 'thru', 'miracle', 'cloning', 'not', 'bad', 'concept', 'demanding', 'own', 'movie', 'second', 'game', 'wardens', 'turned', 'religious', 'zealots', 'striking', 'parallel', 'today', 'government', 'obsessed', 'using', 'environmental', 'iron', 'fist', 'control', 'individual', 'behavior', 'global', 'warmers', 'turned', 'religious', 'nutjobs', 'just', 'replace', 'nature', 'god', 'rule', 'world', 'bwa-ha-ha-ha', '.Dumbest', 'scene', 'when', 'female', 'star', 'weepy-eyed', 'baby', 'goat', 'free', 'trap', 'then', 'defensive', 'when', 'psycho', 'game', 'wardens', 'accuse', 'poaching', 'reason', 'throw', 'makeshift', 'cage', 'naked', 'scared', 'appreciate', 'feelings', 'character', 'had', 'trying', 'rescue', 'defenseless', 'animal', 'high', 'point', 'human', 'conceit', 'intellectual', 'bankruptcy', 'come', 'someone', 'else', 'house', 'game', 'preserve', 'fiddle', 'things', 'are', 'YOUR', 'liking', 'not', 'expect', 'reprisal', 'equal', 'greater', 'actions', 'action', 'equal', 'opposite', 'reaction', 'nature', 'still', 'rules', 'survival', 'fittest', 'Environmentalist', 'seem', 'miss', 'simple', 'equation', 'even', 'simpler', 'law', 'conservation', 'inconvenient', 'truth', 'choose', 'not', 'accept', 'even', 'more', 'write', 'this.Now', 'eating', 'goats', 'Yuck.Anyhoo', 'John', 'Saxon', 'year', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'superior', 'movie', 'five', 'years', 'Battle', 'Beyond', 'Stars', 'eight', 'years', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'eleven', 'years', 'Prisoners', 'Lost', 'Universe', 'Saxon', 'personality', 'screen', 'time']",N/A

Naturally I was in love and wished to see the characters encounter more adventures as they searched for their own loved ones and the earth bound base. Alas, that was not to be (thanks to the networks). However, this story gave you a good ride. You get the p.o.v. of what it very well could be if the world was hit by asteroids; a devastated planet. The work is never actally stated as a part of the offical Star Trek universe that Gene Roddenberry wrote, but personally I always took it as such. Strange New World, Planet Earth: TV Movie (1974)and Genesis II (1973)created and produced by Gene Roddenberry and felt like they were all part of the same Star Trek world. Also, at around this time, the show Arc II, was an American live-action science fiction series aimed at children that aired on CBS beginning in 1976 as part of its Saturday morning line-up. These shows all seemed to fit together as one, even though it wasn't actally meant to.

However, I've found, especially with Genesis II, Planet Earth, and Strange New World... Like most people watching them again years later, that my memories were far more FOND of these video's than they're really worth! The money spend on these disc's was FAR and AWAY the worst money I've ever spent. I guess they need to be sure and get it from those few of us whom remember these movies while they can. My advice? Wait until they are on Amazon for dirt cheap before wasting your time and money. Better yet... see if they're on Amazon Instant Video... and watch them there! You'll be glad you did!That being said, the audio and video were pretty good, considering, when watching these as a kid, we had a ""rabbit ear"" antennae set up which meant half of everything looked like watching out the window through the snow! However, the DVD-R recording meant I could only watch these on my newer DVD player...If you can borrow these... get them cheap... or better yet, request they come on Turner Classic Movies... wait for them to be on there...

The tape wasn't very good and my VCR was pretty much shot, so I saw this print on demand service from Amazon and thought I'd give it a try.I had no problem with the DVD-R playing on my player, and the picture quality, tho not as good as a commercial DVD, was far better than the VHS tape I had. One thing I did notice while watching the movie was some of the scenes were missing. I thought at first I was just misremembering the story, so I checked the time for this DVD and it was listed at 97 minutes. I then checked IMDB and Google and they both listed the time at 100 minutes.For some reason, Amazon and/or MGM have released the show in an edited format, cutting three minutes out of the movie. I have no idea why they would do this since the movie was originally released as a broadcast TV movie in the 1970s and had nothing that would offend the censors then, let alone now. I remember at least two scenes that were cut out, but I don't think both of them together would amount to three minutes, so there may be an other one or two scenes cut out as well that I just don't remember.When I buy a DVD of a broadcast TV movie, I expect to get all of the movie, not some edited version. This is especially true when no where in the Amazon description does it make any mention that this is an edited version and not the complete version as originally shown on TV. It's for this reason I'm giving the movie a three star rating.The show itself, tho kind of juvenile in nature with a simplistic plot and primitive special effects, was still exactly as I remember it, so by itself I would have given it a five star rating just for nostalgic sake. With the edits tho, small as they were, I'm knocking off two stars for selling me an edited version of the movie with no notice that that's what it was.If Amazon wants to send me an uncut 100 minute version of the movie, I'll happily raise my rating to five stars, but till then it'll stay at three stars.",3,Edited Version With Three Minutes Cut Out,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,2033,"['had', 'seen', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'had', 'VHS', 'tape', 'made', 'time', 'tape', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'VCR', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'shot', 'saw', 'print', 'demand', 'service', 'Amazon', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'try.I', 'had', 'problem', 'DVD-R', 'playing', 'player', 'picture', 'quality', 'tho', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'commercial', 'DVD', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'VHS', 'tape', 'had', 'One', 'thing', 'did', 'notice', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'scenes', 'were', 'missing', 'thought', 'first', 'was', 'just', 'misremembering', 'story', 'checked', 'time', 'DVD', 'was', 'listed', '97', 'minutes', 'then', 'checked', 'IMDB', 'Google', 'listed', 'time', '100', 'reason', 'Amazon', 'and/or', 'MGM', 'have', 'released', 'show', 'edited', 'format', 'cutting', 'three', 'minutes', 'movie', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'would', 'do', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'movie', '1970s', 'had', 'nothing', 'would', 'offend', 'censors', 'then', 'let', 'alone', 'now', 'remember', 'least', 'two', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'together', 'would', 'amount', 'three', 'minutes', 'may', 'be', 'other', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'cut', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember.When', 'buy', 'DVD', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'movie', 'expect', 'get', 'movie', 'not', 'edited', 'version', 'especially', 'true', 'when', 'where', 'Amazon', 'description', 'make', 'mention', 'edited', 'version', 'not', 'complete', 'version', 'originally', 'shown', 'TV', 'reason', ""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', 'three', 'star', 'rating.The', 'show', 'tho', 'kind', 'juvenile', 'nature', 'simplistic', 'plot', 'primitive', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'still', 'exactly', 'remember', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'just', 'nostalgic', 'sake', 'edits', 'tho', 'small', 'were', ""'m"", 'knocking', 'off', 'two', 'stars', 'selling', 'edited', 'version', 'movie', 'notice', 'what', 'was.If', 'Amazon', 'send', 'uncut', '100', 'minute', 'version', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'happily', 'raise', 'rating', 'five', 'stars', 'till', 'then', ""'ll"", 'stay', 'three', 'stars']",N/A
