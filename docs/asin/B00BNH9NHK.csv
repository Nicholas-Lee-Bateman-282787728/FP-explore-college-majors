1636400,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00BNH9NHK,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","TOMORROW YOU'RE GONE is no thriller, which is not, of course, an entirely bad thing. It's a strange, dreamlike, and fairly uneventful film about Charlie Rankin (Dorff) being released after a four-year stint in prison, intent on wreaking  vengeance on those who put him there and performing ""hits"" against adversaries of ""The Buddha""(Dafoe), another former--now dead?--inmate who acts as his ethereal mentor. He also meets ""Florence Jane"" (Monaghan) the girl of many-a-guy's dreams, but not Rankin's, who just wants to be friends with her. Florence Jane, it would seem, is a sort of guardian angel figure save, perhaps, the ""guardian"" part. Much of it is open to interpretation, and much of it simply doesn't make a whole lot of sense.More thematic and atmospheric than action-oriented, TOMORROW YOU'RE GONE is well-filmed and well-played, and much of the script (especially Florence Jane's) is quite memorable without being overly pretentious: See the quote from ""The Buddha"" used as my title here. TYG also has things to show and tell us about the futility of vengeance, the destructive nature of bitterness, and various other things.If only the plot were better. . .",3,"""The eyes are the windows to the soul--You gotta learn how to draw your curtains""",1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,1168,"['TOMORROW', 'YOU', 'GONE', 'thriller', 'not', 'course', 'entirely', 'bad', 'thing', 'strange', 'dreamlike', 'fairly', 'uneventful', 'film', 'Charlie', 'Rankin', 'Dorff', 'being', 'released', 'four-year', 'stint', 'prison', 'intent', 'wreaking', 'vengeance', 'who', 'put', 'there', 'performing', 'hits', 'adversaries', 'Buddha', 'Dafoe', 'former', 'now', 'dead', 'inmate', 'who', 'ethereal', 'mentor', 'also', 'Florence', 'Jane', 'Monaghan', 'girl', 'many-a-guy', 'dreams', 'not', 'Rankin', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'friends', 'Florence', 'Jane', 'would', 'seem', 'sort', 'guardian', 'angel', 'figure', 'save', 'perhaps', 'guardian', 'part', 'Much', 'open', 'interpretation', 'much', 'simply', ""n't"", 'make', 'whole', 'lot', 'sense.More', 'thematic', 'atmospheric', 'action-oriented', 'TOMORROW', 'YOU', 'GONE', 'well-filmed', 'well-played', 'much', 'script', 'especially', 'Florence', 'Jane', 'quite', 'memorable', 'being', 'overly', 'pretentious', 'See', 'quote', 'Buddha', 'used', 'title', 'here', 'TYG', 'also', 'things', 'show', 'tell', 'futility', 'vengeance', 'destructive', 'nature', 'bitterness', 'various', 'other', 'things.If', 'only', 'plot', 'were', 'better']",Tomorrow You're Gone
1636401,A2Z3643FSM4PAQ,B00BNH9NHK,Joe Smart,"[3, 3]","Highly pretentious crime flick about an ex-con (Stephen Dorff) who is supposed to kill a man on behalf of a powerful prison acquaintance nick-named the Buddha (Willem Dafoe).  Along the way Dorff meets a slutty dream girl played enthusiastically by Michelle Monaghan, whose career must currently be on a steep downward slide.  The movie is stylized like a waking nightmare, bringing to mind David Lynch's Lost Highway.  For a while you don't know whether everything Stephen Dorff is experiencing is real or not.  The problem is that nothing in the content of the story actually justifies the style--this is ultimately a run of the mill straight to video thriller gussied up as if it were Jacob's Ladder or a David Lynch movie.  Some people might enjoy Tomorrow You Die for it's art-house ambiance but, unfortunately, there's absolutely nothing going on here but empty style.",2,Pretentious and odd,1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,874,"['Highly', 'pretentious', 'crime', 'flick', 'ex-con', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'who', 'supposed', 'kill', 'man', 'behalf', 'powerful', 'prison', 'acquaintance', 'nick-named', 'Buddha', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'way', 'Dorff', 'slutty', 'dream', 'girl', 'played', 'enthusiastically', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'career', 'must', 'currently', 'be', 'steep', 'downward', 'slide', 'movie', 'stylized', 'waking', 'nightmare', 'bringing', 'mind', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Lost', 'Highway', 'while', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'everything', 'Stephen', 'Dorff', 'experiencing', 'real', 'not', 'problem', 'nothing', 'content', 'story', 'actually', 'style', 'ultimately', 'run', 'mill', 'straight', 'video', 'thriller', 'gussied', 'up', 'were', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'David', 'Lynch', 'movie', 'people', 'might', 'enjoy', 'Tomorrow', 'Die', 'art-house', 'ambiance', 'unfortunately', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'going', 'here', 'empty', 'style']",Tomorrow You're Gone

Charley (Stephen Dorff) gets out of prison and is going to perform a hit for Willem Dafoe. Nine minutes into the film you are going WTF as you realize Charley has some reality issues. We see Charley performing things he didn't do. Or did he do them in the past? Or is he imagining himself doing things?Armed with money, a gun, and a powder puff blue bowling ball bag, Charley meets Florance (Michelle Monaghan) on a bus. She takes him home with her, but Charley attempts to keep his head clear, why I don't know as he never seems to be all there. Florance tells us that ""we all have layers"" perhaps a key to this character story. Her character is supposed to be quirky, but it didn't seemed developed very well.By the end of the story, I didn't feel I had any real closure for this artsy film. Good Luck.

1636405,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B00BNH9NHK,Tony Heck,"[5, 8]","""You have me to get you started out"" Charlie Rankin (Dorff) has just got out of prison and stops in to see a man called ""The Buddha"" (Dafoe) who was writing him in prison. He is told about someone he is to murder for him. When the murder goes wrong Charlie begins to worry about what will happen. Him and a woman named Florence (Monaghan) begin to hang around together and Charlie thinks it will help, but he isn't sure of anything anymore. I have to start by saying that I did enjoy this and I recommend this movie but it is not for everyone. While not a total ""art-house"" type movie it is in that vein. The movie is more of a character driven type movie then I was expecting, but I really think that helped the movie. Dorff is good in this and Defoe has a strong and powerful presence even though he is only in it a few minutes. This is not really a fast paced movie but it will keep you watching right up until the end. I liked it. Overall, not a movie for everyone but well worth checking out. I say B.",4,A very good movie with an art house type quality. Casting is perfect & I recommend but not for everyone.
