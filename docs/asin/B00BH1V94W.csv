It was slow moving, it probably could have been wrapped up in a little over an hour.  But, the acting was superb, the storyline enjoyable, and the message was powerfully moving.

In a great romantic/comedy style without any suggestion of anything improper, Christina Karis and Jefferson Moore, cross swords and half of the United States in one of the most beautiful trucks ever to star in a film. The nods to the Three Stooges and many other greats of the comedy past and the final message of family, God, faith and being a part of all these things as a part of our lives, topped with a healthy dose of chivalry and honor that takes us all to a higher level.I love tis film and congratulate Kelly's for their excellent work.",5,Best yet from Kellys FilmWorks,1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,717,"['new', 'direction', 'Kelly', 'makers', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'films', 'message', 'result', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'cross', 'country', 'journeys', 'ever', 'filmed', 'great', 'romantic/comedy', 'style', 'suggestion', 'anything', 'improper', 'Christina', 'Karis', 'Jefferson', 'Moore', 'cross', 'swords', 'half', 'United', 'States', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'trucks', 'ever', 'star', 'film', 'nods', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'many', 'other', 'greats', 'comedy', 'past', 'final', 'message', 'family', 'God', 'faith', 'being', 'part', 'things', 'part', 'lives', 'topped', 'healthy', 'dose', 'chivalry', 'honor', 'higher', 'level.I', 'tis', 'film', 'congratulate', 'Kelly', 'excellent', 'work']",Pieces of Easter
