1413212,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004LROMQ6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 5]","Naturally, I approach any Lifetime ""ripped from the headlines"" television opus with a fair amount of caution--but like a moth to a flame, I am generally unable to resist the bad movie allure! And ""The Craigslist Killer"" fits squarely into their dramatic oeuvre with its reinterpretation of the recent high profile case. However, this being Lifetime (the champion of women in peril films), the notorious story is told largely through the eyes of the accused murderer's fiancee. But darned if ""The Craigslist Killer"" didn't surprise me! With charming leads and an intriguing set-up, I quite bought into this tale. But just as I thought ""I really like this!""--the film's second half gets sillier and sillier as the police close in on their subject. So after a terrific start, the laugh out loud moments in the final act were a bit disappointing!Philip Markoff (Jake McDorman) and Megan McCallister (Agnes Bruckner) meet cute and begin an ideal courtship. Markoff, a brilliant medical student, seemingly has it all with an even brighter future right around the corner. They make a perfect couple! Only one thing can mar this otherwise lovely relationship--the fact that Markoff has become a serial killer! The Craigslist encounters themselves seem rather subdued. At first, Markoff seems to be doing these sessions as thrill robberies and humiliations--but when one goes bad, a death results. Never one to support robberies, abuse, or murder--it is hard to imagine why these cases (as shown) created a national media firestorm. Aside from the alluring chance to attack Craigslist, I literally see more violence and debauchery every night on my local news.  And I'm not joking. Once he has the taste for it, though, Markoff can't quit. Megan refuses to believe, despite her suspicions, until the police are closing in on our golden boy.First, the good. ""The Criagslist Killer"" works, in part, due to leads McDorman and Bruckner. They are, simply put, likable. McDorman, in particular, does a great job balancing the different aspects of his persona. While not a psychological portrait (family tensions are mentioned, but not dissected), he does his best to highlight what made Markoff such an unlikely killer--one that avoided every stereotypical police profile. McDorman is easily the film's greatest asset! Now, the bad. The movie gets more and more ludicrous as it progresses. It's certainly disconcerting to think that Markoff was arranging online assignations while his fiancee was in the room! She never seems very curious or asks what he's working on. But, and here's the absolute topper, guess where he hides crucial evidence--under the mattress of their shared bed in the one room apartment. I guess Megan never changed the sheets or she would have made an unpleasant discovery. The police work, itself, is portrayed with TV movie shorthand and fails to ignite even a spark of interest or creativity.This is an obvious fictionalization, so anyone expecting this to be the definitive true story is barking up the wrong tree. As much of the movie is handled through the Megan McCallister character and the real life McCallister has been tight lipped to the media about her experiences, naturally you have to expect dramatic license and third party reinterpretation. And that's fine. I just wanted to point this out for those who might approach this as absolute truth as opposed to a ""based on"" real life movie. Even with its flaws, this is still a decent Lifetime endeavor. If you're interested in the topic or a fan of McDorman, I'd definitely check it out.

1413213,AETEH7SOTOFRT,B004LROMQ6,KittyScratchesBooks,"[2, 3]","I really tried to watch this movie, but I found myself grinding my teeth at the mishaps through out the production. Now, I can see that there are so many people who liked this one, but when you view the ""48 Hours"" Documentary about it, I think that you may understand why.I am not rating this low because I want to get on anyone's nerves. I am truly giving this a low rating because I KNOW that they could have left this for a production who had the patience and the right casting and a director who has a docu-drama vision (with the alignment of sharpness as the ""Fatal Vision"" movie).I'm  truly sorry folks, I cannot honestly say that even for those who liked it that it is worth 9.95. Wait until the price drops or record this one through your Comcast/ Xfinity line up. There are movies that are truly worth the money that you spend and then there are others (like this one) that made me gag. To those who really loved it, it does not reflect on your taste. I personally , really, disliked it. I wanted to like it. I really did. I was look forward all day into the night to watch this one. I thought, now they can't possibly chew this one up as well, they just can't. But they did....Lifetime has been making movies that just lack the suspense of the films that they formerly aired when Lifetime was hot in the mid to early 1990s to 2004. Lifetime aired True Story films that were produced from other networks and that is what drew so many viewers in to this channel orignally. Men were actually watching this channel in the early Millinium and it just has lost its appeal across the board. The men do not even like this present day ""Lifetime"" any more. I have collections of recordings when Lifetime even aired the Robert Stack ""Unsolved Mysteries"" and it was a great channel. It was the only station that I could count on for the very best. But something happened...the quality just...I don't know, is so shoddy and too whiny, everyone sounds like a duck, I mean, who speaks like this and so loud. No natural talent in the casting anymore. Just disappointing.There are very few Lifetime movies worth catching like the Drew Peterson case (Untouchable) and I truly heard that Rob Lowe was pretty close to chilling. This version of this true story about ""Seven Days of Rage: The Craigslist Killer"" was just so weak that anyone would be better off purchasing this one at a price close to 1.25 or so because Lifetime really needs to take the time to build up true suspense and learn from the former masters why Lifetime was truly the place to be over 15 years ago. Not all the Lifetime movies are bad, but they are not very good as of the past 5 years and plus.They haven't even aired ""Dead By Sunset"" and all the other oldies but goodies in such a very long time. Lifetime use to be a very edgy channel that dared to show very scary movies based on True-Stories and now they have sanitized them to the point to remove the entire point of what makes a true story suspenseful. It is as if they have mixed in too much Disney/Pixar meets Hallmark with a touch of Nick at Nite...it's too insincere and lacks the meat that Lifetime used to serve up. I would like to see Lifetime use better directors, take some chances, use some better actors, and producers and seasoned actors for their future projects so that this new generation of folks will really know what a ""sink your teeth"" into a well told  drama/thriller truly is. If you are going to pay for anything and if they are going to flood cable with 20 commercials every 5 minutes , then, they can afford to churn out a better product than this. It isn't fair and I truly am not the only one.By the way, catch, ""Seven Days of Rage: The Craigslist Killer"" and a few of the other true stories which ended up under this new ""Lifetime"" team. When you go to ""You Tube"", you will be able to watch a grittier version of what they tried to do here and the entire version is uploaded to watch the ""48 Hours"" version of this case. I just watched it again tonight and the news magazine has so much more substance than whatever they were trying to do here. Even the scoring (music build-up) fell flat.Music tension is very key to a story with this level of intensity and Lifetime did an injustice to this story. It should not always focus on the women all of the time, there should be a balance of genders contributing to the story. It was the same thing that they did to the recent movie aired a week or two ago about the Col. in Canada who stole women's underwear and murdered his own solider who worked under him and GARY COLE played the role and it was so disappointing. Gary Cole is our favorite. He is the best for true stories, but was miscast, just as they miscasted the actors in THIS movie.And please folks, this is not a personal put down towards anyone who liked it. In fact, when I played this movie at my home, I invited others for big screen ""Movie Night"" and I just was not the only one who reacted this way about this version of the ""Craigslist Killer"". It felt as if they were cheating the audience out of the true effect of what actually happened in this case.It was not even close to the actual story (or that they even tried to cast the most accurate characters) and they could have tried with a bit more effort. And yes, I really could have directed a better version (as this is my calling)  that would not have cheated the audience into releasing something before the competition.Just save your money for a richer and better true story movie. This will come on again and again because it is fairly new. This movie is not going off the shelves anytime soon and your money is better spent developing your collection on movies that are rare or hard to find before those movies are completely ""out"" of America.I couldn't even find  ""Murder Between Friends"" in THIS country any more and I had to go to another specialized site to order that movie at a better price and on DVD. Focus on the Patty Duke collections and the movies that were made from other networks before purchasing this one or just wait for a used copy in solid condition. Just do not pay full price for this one because I KNOW that they could have devoted more effort into this film. I sincerely do.",1,Stop Making Movies Lifetime,1343779200,"08 1, 2012",2012,6222,"['really', 'tried', 'watch', 'movie', 'found', 'grinding', 'teeth', 'mishaps', 'production', 'Now', 'can', 'see',

I think they did enough of a good job in mimicing this killer, a killer who at first got a thrill at robbing these women at gun point which later escalated to killing.

1413218,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B004LROMQ6,Todd Smith,"[1, 2]","This is not a story that deserves a film adaptation, however the Lifetime network felt differently and produced a movie based on this very benign story, that captivated the nation. For those who are unaware, this is a true story that happened in Boston, five years ago. A Boston medical student, on the verge of getting married, spends his nights cruising Craigslist's exotic services page, in order to find woman he can humiliate, but the story takes a tragic turn when he accidentally kills one of them. The story made national headlines and people became obsessed with why such a smart, successful man, would do these terrible things. Usually, films that are based on real life events are the most compelling, but the Craigslist Killer is different, for the fact that he wasn't active for very long. Much of this movie is focused on the killer's normal life and relationship with his fiancee. It's a lot of romantic garbage and stuff about their relationship and in fact we don't see his dark side revealed until much later in the movie. There wasn't even an interesting police angle or manhunt for this guy, as the police simply traced his IP address and got his picture from security cameras. The acting was the only thing I enjoyed about this film as Jake McDorman is fantastic playing a man with two personas. His fiancee is played by the beautiful, Agnes Bruckner, who was also very good, if not a bit naive and obsessive. The true story may have captivated the nation, but the film about the Craigslist Killer has no bite and was just plain boring.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]- @tss5078,1372291200,"06 27, 2013",2013,1557,"['not', 'story', 'film', 'adaptation', 'however', 'Lifetime', 'network', 'felt', 'differently', 'produced', 'movie', 'based', 'very', 'benign', 'story', 'captivated', 'nation', 'who', 'are', 'unaware', 'true', 'story', 'happened', 'Boston', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'A', 'Boston', 'medical', 'student', 'verge', 'getting', 'married', 'nights', 'cruising', 'Craigslist', 'exotic', 'services', 'page', 'order', 'find', 'woman', 'can', 'humiliate', 'story', 'tragic', 'turn', 'when', 'accidentally', 'one', 'story', 'made', 'national', 'headlines', 'people', 'became', 'obsessed', 'why', 'such', 'smart', 'successful', 'man', 'would', 'do', 'terrible', 'things', 'Usually', 'films', 'are', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'are', 'most', 'compelling', 'Craigslist', 'Killer', 'different', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'active', 'very', 'long', 'Much', 'movie', 'focused', 'killer', 'normal', 'life', 'relationship', 'fiancee', 'lot', 'romantic', 'garbage', 'stuff', 'relationship', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'dark', 'side', 'revealed', 'much', 'later', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'interesting', 'police', 'angle', 'manhunt', 'guy', 'police', 'simply', 'traced', 'IP', 'address', 'got', 'picture', 'security', 'cameras', 'acting', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'Jake', 'McDorman', 'fantastic', 'playing', 'man', 'two', 'personas', 'fiancee', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Agnes', 'Bruckner', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'bit', 'naive', 'obsessive', 'true', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'captivated', 'nation', 'film', 'Craigslist', 'Killer', 'bite', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'boring']",The Craigslist Killer
