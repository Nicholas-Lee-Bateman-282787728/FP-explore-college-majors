294895,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302091632,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","To the delight of little children everywhere, a film like `Home Alone' really never goes out of style.  Sure, the subsequent sequels pale in comparison and tend to overstay their welcome a bit, and yes that same overuse can ware on the integrity and adoration of the original, but when the dust settles and the smoke clears there are still bountiful smiles to be found in a group of people watching this film.  As some have mentioned, it can get over the top, but isn't that what we are paying for here.How else would an eight-year-old boy get one-up on two dim-witted thieves if it wasn't `over the top'!The film tells the story of underappreciated Kevin McCallister.  Brother to four siblings who pick on him and son to two parents who are apparently distracted by life in general, Kevin has had it.  He just wants to be alone.  In preparing for a family vacation in Paris, the McCallister house is bombarded by family and countless other little rug rats who clutter every crevice of the house making it pretty easy to lose track of who is who and who is where; which is precisely why the McCallister family makes their way across the globe to Paris without young Kevin.  Fooled by his young mind into thinking that his family's disappearance was his fault, Kevin finds himself initially gleeful over his newfound freedom (a house all to himself), but soon he encounters two thieves who didn't count on Kevin's presence when they broke into the McCallister home.  The night gets interesting as Kevin fends for himself with witty and highly improbable tactics, while his parents lose their minds overseas to the point where his mother stops at nothing to get home.Yes, there is much about `Home Alone' that is beyond ridiculous, but one thing that isn't ridiculous is Macaulay Culkin's performance.  For such a young boy, he slays this.  He's hilarious, totally three-dimensional (in a performance that could have become generically one-note) and truly believable, even when he's engaged in highly unbelievable activities.  He just oozes a charisma and charm that defies his age and creates a legendary character.  There are few actors who create such unforgettable screen images, but everyone (even people who haven't ever seen this film) will recognize that adorable little face pressed between two hands with that wide open scream.  Yes, Culkin is unforgettable.So, at the end of the day, `Home Alone' is a lot of fun.  At times it is cheap fun, and if we're going to be completely honest it is Culkin who really remains the most endearing and memorable facet of this film (if his performance had not been genius then this film would not be a landmark) but none of that matters with a film so rich with nostalgia.You have to love it!",4,Such fun!,1314748800,"08 31, 2011",2011,2737,"['delight', 'little', 'children', 'everywhere', 'film', 'Home', 'Alone', 'really', 'never', 'style', 'Sure', 'subsequent', 'sequels', 'pale', 'comparison', 'tend', 'overstay', 'welcome', 'bit', 'yes', 'same', 'overuse', 'can', 'ware', 'integrity', 'adoration', 'original', 'when', 'dust', 'settles', 'smoke', 'are', 'still', 'bountiful', 'smiles', 'be', 'found', 'group', 'people', 'watching', 'film', 'have', 'mentioned', 'can', 'get', 'top', ""n't"", 'what', 'are', 'paying', 'here.How', 'else', 'would', 'eight-year-old', 'boy', 'get', 'one-up', 'two', 'dim-witted', 'thieves', 'was', ""n't"", 'top', 'film', 'story', 'underappreciated', 'Kevin', 'McCallister', 'Brother', 'four', 'siblings', 'who', 'pick', 'son', 'two', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'apparently', 'distracted', 'life', 'general', 'Kevin', 'had', 'just', 'be', 'alone', 'preparing', 'family', 'vacation', 'Paris', 'McCallister', 'house', 'bombarded', 'family', 'countless', 'other', 'little', 'rug', 'rats', 'who', 'clutter', 'crevice', 'house', 'making', 'pretty', 'easy', 'lose', 'track', 'who', 'who', 'who', 'where', 'precisely', 'why', 'McCallister', 'family', 'way', 'globe', 'Paris', 'young', 'Kevin', 'Fooled', 'young', 'mind', 'thinking', 'family', 'disappearance', 'was', 'fault', 'Kevin', 'initially', 'gleeful', 'newfound', 'freedom', 'house', 'soon', 'two', 'thieves', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'count', 'Kevin', 'presence', 'when', 'broke', 'McCallister', 'home', 'night', 'interesting', 'Kevin', 'witty', 'highly', 'improbable', 'tactics', 'parents', 'lose', 'minds', 'overseas', 'point', 'where', 'mother', 'stops', 'nothing', 'get', 'home.Yes', 'much', 'Home', 'Alone', 'ridiculous', 'one', 'thing', ""n't"", 'ridiculous', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'performance', 'young', 'boy', 'hilarious', 'totally', 'three-dimensional', 'performance', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'generically', 'one-note', 'truly', 'believable', 'even', 'when', 'engaged', 'highly', 'unbelievable', 'activities', 'just', 'charisma', 'charm', 'age', 'legendary', 'character', 'are', 'few', 'actors', 'who', 'create', 'such', 'unforgettable', 'screen', 'images', 'everyone', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'will', 'recognize', 'adorable', 'little', 'face', 'pressed', 'two', 'hands', 'wide', 'open', 'scream', 'Yes', 'Culkin', 'unforgettable.So', 'end', 'day', 'Home', 'Alone', 'lot', 'fun', 'times', 'cheap', 'fun', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'Culkin', 'who', 'really', 'most', 'endearing', 'memorable', 'facet', 'film', 'performance', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'genius', 'then', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'landmark', 'none', 'matters', 'film', 'so', 'rich', 'nostalgia.You', 'have', 'love']",Home Alone VHS

From ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" to ""Nine Months"", he has directed some of the finest contemporary comedies of the 1990s'.But no matter what Columbus does, his crowning achievement will always be 1990's ""Home Alone"". Between Columbus's skillful directing and John Hughes' brilliant script, this film represents what American comedy should be.The plot of the film is quite simple yet somewhat unrealistic, which is where the movie's impeccable charm lies. Eight - year - old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin before he met Michael Jackson) is the black sheep of his loose Chicago family. His parents (Catherine O'Hara and John Heard) treat him like a child, while the rest of his family - including smarmy Uncle Frank, older brother Buzz and the bedwetting Fuller (brother Kieran) - treats him like trash. After getting into a huge fight with them the night before a Christmas vaction to France, Kevin wishes that he doesn't have a family. His mom says she hopes his wish comes true. The next day, the family wakes up late and is in such a rush to get to the airport that they leave Kevin asleep in the attic. Thinking his wish has come true, Kevin lives it up at home. Little does he know, burglars Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) are home alone, too, and taking advantage of it as well.This is a true holiday classic that you can watch any time of year.

294897,A13H2JJ3GEMJN1,6302091632,"AntiochAndy ""antiochandy""","[2, 2]","HOME ALONE was very successful in its theatrical run and its popularity has proven to be enduring. Small wonder. This is a very funny and entertaining movie. Kevin, the youngest member of his family, goes to bed wishing his family would disappear. The following morning finds his family in a rush to get to the airport to catch their flight to Paris, where they are going to spend the Christmas holiday, and running very late. In the hubbub, Kevin gets left behind. He awakens to find that his wish seems to have been granted; he's been left home alone. His elation at finding he's the ""man of the house"" is only one of many great scenes in this movie. Macaulay Culkin shines as Kevin. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are also very funny as a pair of burglars working the neighborhood.The editorial reviewer here comments that the ""violence"" in the later stages of HOME ALONE is ""over the top"". Over the top of what? There are no knives or machine guns in evidence here. Some broken christmas tree ornaments, a red hot doorknob, a couple of paint cans, some icy stairs, a b-b gun ... this is the kind of violence we're talking about here. Realistically, yeah, these burglars are ridiculously inept and somebody could get seriously hurt on slippery concrete steps, but as theatrical violence goes this is pretty harmless stuff.

So, why not hit on some Christmas movies?. Released back in 1990, HA was released on an unsuspecting public and became the largest grossing comedy motion picture of all time. While it is incredibly fun and entertaining and funny, should we be laughing at how a family left a little 8 year old boy home alone during Christmas?. Or was it really their fault?. The movie centers on the McAlister family. Headed by parents John Heard and Catherine 'O' Hara, the family, and quite a large one at that, are off to the airport. Unfortunatley, there was a mix up and little Kevin(Macaulay Culkin) is left behind. When Kevin realizes the horrors, he begins to realize that this is every little kid's dream. A life with no parents, no grown ups, no nothing. His own house to himself. He can do whatever he wants. It quickly goes sour when two burglars(Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern), plan on robbing the house. Something Kevin overhears and prepares for. When the two bumbling doofus' come to collect, they enter a house full of boobytraps and other inventions of pain and torture that Kevin devised to save his house. Okay, so th mistake of leaving Kevin behind is somewhat plausible and can be forgiven. It happened, and it's not that it couldn't, and the family were mortified and tried everything they could to get back. Or at least the mother did. Some reviewers were quick to blame, even calling the mother 'horrible', but that is not right. It was an honest mix-up, and she was scared as heck and it was her who did everything she could to get back. Is she that bad for what happened?. Not at all. What strains credibility, is the robbers and the total fun house that Kevin turns his home into. Obviously, this is the best part, and the part most want to see, but it's inconceivable. This little kid, in a time of turmoil and danger, instantly turns into a brilliant little MacGyver, with everything working properly, and having the best timing of any kid, or adult, around. But then again, this is not a movie for logic. It's fun. Nothing but fun and entertainment and HA succeeds on every level in that area. Director Chris Columbus shoots the film really well, and the time and feel of the season is warm and inviting. The actors are all on their game and seem to enjoy what they are doing. Pesci and Stern(not the over the hill, hanging by a thread ""B"" stars, as an inept review below states), are hilarious as they try to withstand, and fail, every thing Kevin throws at them. Culkin himself is adorable and has a nice presence and charm. HA is not up there with any of Hollywood's epics, but it is a holiday and comedy classic, and it does what it does. Followed by a decent sequel, and a part 3 and 4 that should be avoided at all costs.",5,And All Through The House....,1099785600,"11 7, 2004",2004,2847,"['Halloween', 'world', 'quickly', 'slipping', 'holiday', 'season', 'have', 'been', 'Christmas', 'mood', 'So', 'why', 'not', 'hit', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'Released', 'back', '1990', 'HA', 'was', 'released', 'unsuspecting', 'public', 'became', 'largest', 'grossing', 'comedy', 'motion', 'picture', 'time', 'incredibly', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'should', 'be', 'laughing', 'how', 'family', 'left', 'little', '8', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'home', 'alone', 'Christmas', 'was', 'really', 'fault', 'movie', 'centers', 'McAlister', 'family', 'Headed', 'parents', 'John', 'Heard', 'Catherine', 'O', 'Hara', 'family', 'quite', 'large', 'one', 'are', 'airport', 'Unfortunatley', 'was', 'mix', 'up', 'little', 'Kevin', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'left', 'behind', 'When', 'Kevin', 'horrors', 'realize', 'little', 'kid', 'dream', 'life', 'parents', 'grown', 'ups', 'nothing', 'own', 'house', 'can', 'do', 'whatever', 'quickly', 'sour', 'when', 'two', 'burglars', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'plan', 'robbing', 'house', 'Something', 'Kevin', 'overhears', 'prepares', 'When', 'two', 'bumbling', 'doofus', 'come', 'collect', 'enter', 'house', 'full', 'boobytraps', 'other', 'inventions', 'pain', 'torture', 'Kevin', 'devised', 'save', 'house', 'Okay', 'so', 'th', 'mistake', 'leaving', 'Kevin', 'behind', 'somewhat', 'plausible', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'happened', 'not', 'could', ""n't"", 'family', 'were', 'mortified', 'tried', 'everything', 'could', 'get', 'back', 'least', 'mother', 'did', 'reviewers', 'were', 'quick', 'blame', 'even', 'calling', 'mother', ""'horrible"", 'not', 'right', 'was', 'honest', 'mix-up', 'was', 'scared', 'heck', 'was', 'who', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'get', 'back', 'bad', 'what', 'happened', 'Not', 'What', 'credibility', 'robbers', 'total', 'fun', 'house', 'Kevin', 'home', 'Obviously', 'best', 'part', 'part', 'most', 'want', 'see', 'inconceivable', 'little', 'kid', 'time', 'turmoil', 'danger', 'instantly', 'brilliant', 'little', 'MacGyver', 'everything', 'working', 'properly', 'having', 'best', 'timing', 'kid', 'adult', 'then', 'again', 'not', 'movie', 'logic', 'fun', 'Nothing', 'fun', 'entertainment', 'HA', 'level', 'area', 'Director', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'shoots', 'film', 'really', 'well', 'time', 'feel', 'season', 'warm', 'inviting', 'actors', 'are', 'game', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'Pesci', 'Stern', 'not', 'hill', 'hanging', 'thread', 'B', 'stars', 'inept', 'review', 'states', 'are', 'hilarious', 'try', 'withstand', 'fail', 'thing', 'Kevin', 'Culkin', 'adorable', 'nice', 'presence', 'charm', 'HA', 'not', 'there', 'Hollywood', 'epics', 'holiday', 'comedy', 'classic', 'what', 'Followed', 'decent', 'sequel', 'part', '3', '4', 'should', 'be', 'avoided', 'costs']",Home Alone VHS

Macaulay Culkin does wonderful job portraying an 8 year old boy who is accidently left alone in his home by his family and also protecting his home from 2 criminals (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) by setting up mischivous contraptions that cause horrible pain!  Although Culkin's acting career has not been doing so well these days,his early movies like this one is something you will love.Anyway, the story starts off with a family known as the McCallisters getting ready to go on a vacation.  At dinner, the youngest child, Kevin (Culkin)creates a big mess in the kitchen (After getting anoid by his brother) and is punished to sleep in the attic.  Because of that,kevin wishes his family would just dissapear.but coensidently a storm comes in the middle of the night and takes out the electricity causing the alarm clocks to go out.  The family over sleeps and then rushes to get ready when they realize they are behind scedule and are on the verge of missing their flight.  With all the hurrying and a miss count, the family goes on vacation not knowing they left kevin behind.  Kevin on the other hand wakes up and sees that there is nobody there and assumes that his wish came true.  Kevin automatically goes wild and does things he would need permission to do.  But Kevin's fun isn't going as well as he thought, 2 crooks by the name of Marve(Stern) and Harry (Pesci)want to robb his home.  Kevin does what he can to make it look like there are people in his home but Marve and Harry smell something fishy because they know the McCallister family went on vacation.  Eventually the crooks realize that they were just being outsmarted by a little kid who is home alone and decide that the next time they come, nothing will stop them.  Kevin knows this is bad news for him and wishes his family would come back.  To protect his home, Kevin builds wild contraption that anybody laugh.  These contraptions show dumb robbers can be.Anybody who sees this movie for the first time will laugh their heads off.  Although a little boy trying to take out two crooks is totally impossible, Home Alone is a really great family film that shows that what you wish for may not be something you want.  This movie is appropriate for all ages so If I were you I'd by this movie and watch with my family because it will be something they will enjoy.",5,Even after 10 years I never get tired of watching this movie,1029110400,"08 12, 2002",2002,2457,"['Home', 'alone', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'was', '4', 'am', 'now', '14', 'still', 'laugh', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', '8', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'accidently', 'left', 'alone', 'home', 'family', 'also', 'protecting', 'home', '2', 'criminals', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'setting', 'up', 'mischivous', 'contraptions', 'cause', 'horrible', 'pain', 'Culkin', 'acting', 'career', 'not', 'been', 'doing', 'so', 'well', 'days', 'early', 'movies', 'one', 'something', 'will', 'love.Anyway', 'story', 'family', 'known', 'McCallisters', 'getting', 'ready', 'go', 'vacation', 'dinner', 'youngest', 'child', 'Kevin', 'Culkin', 'big', 'mess', 'kitchen', 'getting', 'anoid', 'brother', 'punished', 'sleep', 'attic', 'kevin', 'family', 'would', 'just', 'dissapear.but', 'coensidently', 'storm', 'middle', 'night', 'out', 'electricity', 'causing', 'alarm', 'clocks', 'go', 'out', 'family', 'sleeps', 'then', 'rushes', 'get', 'ready', 'when', 'realize', 'are', 'scedule', 'are', 'verge', 'missing', 'flight', 'hurrying', 'miss', 'count', 'family', 'vacation', 'not', 'knowing', 'left', 'kevin', 'Kevin', 'other', 'hand', 'up', 'sees', 'nobody', 'there', 'wish', 'came', 'true', 'Kevin', 'automatically', 'wild', 'things', 'would', 'need', 'permission', 'do', 'Kevin', 'fun', ""n't"", 'going', 'as', 'well', 'thought', '2', 'crooks', 'name', 'Marve', 'Stern', 'Harry', 'Pesci', 'want', 'robb', 'home', 'Kevin', 'what', 'can', 'make', 'look', 'are', 'people', 'home', 'Marve', 'Harry', 'smell', 'something', 'fishy', 'know', 'McCallister', 'family', 'went', 'vacation', 'Eventually', 'crooks', 'realize', 'were', 'just', 'being', 'outsmarted', 'little', 'kid', 'who', 'home', 'alone', 'decide', 'next', 'time', 'come', 'nothing', 'will', 'stop', 'Kevin', 'bad', 'news', 'wishes', 'family', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'protect', 'home', 'Kevin', 'wild', 'contraption', 'anybody', 'laugh', 'contraptions', 'show', 'dumb', 'robbers', 'can', 'be.Anybody', 'who', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'will', 'laugh', 'heads', 'off', 'little', 'boy', 'trying', 'take', 'out', 'two', 'crooks', 'totally', 'impossible', 'Home', 'Alone', 'really', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'what', 'wish', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'something', 'want', 'movie', 'appropriate', 'ages', 'were', ""'d"", 'movie', 'watch', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'something', 'will', 'enjoy']",Home Alone VHS

The copy I purchased came sealed and wrapped, and everything about it seemed brand new. But the DVD video plays like it's a mediocre pirated recording. Small screen - not a full or a widescreen - and really grainy picture. The audio isn't great either, it's scratchy at times. Very limited DVD menu, too. About the only good thing about the DVD is that there are no previews to sift through - more evidence that maybe this isn't an authorized reproduction.For now, this will work for my purposes. Maybe later when the next movie-viewing medium comes out I'll upgrade and be more careful about the copy I buy. For those shopping: like I said, make sure you know the return policy before you buy, and if it's a gift order well before Christmas so you have time to check it out.Also I bought directly from Amazon (weird that they sell such a crummy DVD recording), and you can't beat the shipping and prices at the holidays.

The McCallister family is spending their Christmas in France. The youngest, Kevin, hates his family for the way they treat him, especially his older brother, Buzz. After getting into a fight, Kevin wishes to never see them again.In the morning, Kevin wakes up to find he is home alone. The family left for France, and due to a counting mistake, forgot Kevin.

It mixes some superb physical comedy with a wistful tale of a little boy who, for Christmas, just wants his family back.As the story opens, the large McAllister family is packing out for a Christmas-time trip to Paris.  Somehow, eight year-old Kevin McAllister (Macauley Culkin) sleeps through the chaos of their departure and wakes up alone in the house, just days before Christmas. Kevin misses his family but takes their disappearence more or less in stride, feeding himself and taking care of the house.Kevin's life gets a lot more complicated when two burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) target the house.  The resouceful Kevin, in a series of hysterically funny and implausible battles, defends the house against the two inept burglars.

294965,A1ZSOK69XSXF73,6302091632,"Duckman ""Morbid Cynic""","[1, 1]","Since it's Christmas time, I think it's appropriate to review one of the most well-known staples in Christmas films, Home Alone.  I loved this movie when I first saw it back in the very early 90's, and throughout my childhood, I related to Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) really well, being a ""little brother"" myself (and that at the time, I loved cheese pizza, just like Kevin). However, when my teenage and adult years came around, it was time to get more critical since logical thinking became more dominant in my mind.STORYThe McCallister family is getting ready to fly from their Chicago home to Paris before Christmas.  The night before the family leaves, Kevin gets into a fight over pizza with his older brother, Buzz (Devin Ratray).  Kevin gets punished for instigating the fight and causing a big mess, and in a fit of anger, wishes that his family would disappear.  After the power gets knocked out that night, the family is running late for their flight and forget about Kevin in the rush.  All the while, a pair of burglars, Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Joe Pesci), known as the Wet Bandits, have their eyes set on robbing Kevin's house.CHARACTERSWhile not perfect, I thought the characters were well done in this movie.  While I'm not really a fan of Macaulay Culkin, I thought he was good as Kevin in this movie. Kevin is a believable kid, since he generally hits the ""right spot"" in between overly likeable and being an annoying little brat.  He's generally a good but misunderstood kid, but can show signs of selfishness.John Heard and Catherine O'Hara are good as Kevin's parents, Peter and Kate.  They're shown as parents who seem to be a little cold towards Kevin, but deep down, they really do love and care about him.The supporting cast was decent as Kevin's other family, and it's funny to think that Michael C. Maronna played one of Kevin's family members (Maronna would later become Big Pete in the classic Nickelodeon show The Adventures of Pete & Pete).  Roberts Blossom is great as Marley Murphy, a man misunderstood as a bad guy, but turns out to be a good person.Pesci and Stern are quite good as Harry and Marv.  Unlike a lot of family comedies revolving around a kid outsmarting the bad guys, Marv and Harry are actually pretty convincing as burglars.  They show to be menacing and believable in how they act before their ""showdown"" with Kevin.  Despite being victims to Kevin's creative traps, they're shown to be a little smart and ruthless at times, and these don't feel forced.HUMORThe humor in this movie is quite solid. Of course, the funniest parts of this movie are when Marv and Harry try to break into Kevin's house, unsuspecting of Kevin's traps.  Some of the funniest moments in this phase of the movie are when Marv accidentally steps on a bunch of Christmas ornaments with his bare feet, when he accidentally steps on a nail with bare feet, and when Kevin puts a tarantula on Marv's face, causing him to scream like a little girl.Even before the phase of the movie where Kevin faces off against Marv and Harry, there's still some good humor to be found.  Some examples are of the scenes where Kevin puts aftershave on his face, causing him to scream and when he goes to see a local Santa Clause, and you see this Santa smoking and ranting about getting a parking ticket.LOGICAL FLAWSI would have given this movie at least a percentage in the 70's, but after analyzing some of the logical fallacies in this movie, I had to bring the rating down a notch in order to give all of you a more fair and balanced review.Some of the biggest logical flaws in this movie are when Kevin pranks the pizza guy into thinking someone is shooting at him and the other is when he sets up the traps in his house.  The former in that it's pretty odd that the pizza guy didn't call the cops after the incident, though he might have been really scared to report it to anyone.  The other in that Kevin sets up some pretty messy traps in the house, such as the tar-lined staircase in the basement.  Did Kevin even think of how he could clean that up?CINEMATOGRAPHYThe cinematography in this movie is splendid.  Julio Macat captures lots of great imagery of winter suburban Chicago and even of Paris in some scenes.  For a family-oriented Christmas film, these clean, pristine images are perfect.SOUNDTRACKJohn Williams's music for Home Alone is very good.  Many of the instrumental compositions in this movie are almost Christmas time staples nowadays, and they stir up all the right emotions.The choice of more ""traditional"" Christmas tunes wasn't bad, either.  They sound good and fit the movie like a glove.  I'm glad the Chipmunk Song wasn't used in this movie, as I HATE that song (though that's a different kettle of fish).FINAL WORDThis is easily the best Home Alone movie in the whole series.  While not mandatory viewing, Home Alone is a pleasant Christmas family film, and essentially John Hughes's last good contribution to cinema.",3,A childhood favorite that has aged pretty well.

294971,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,6302091632,Eric S. Kim,"[0, 1]","What if you found yourself home alone during the holidays? Well, that's part of the basic premise of this popular Christmas classic. Macaulay Culkin plays the role of Kevin, an 8-year old boy who gets fed up with his entire family. One night before they set off to Paris, Kevin wishes that every single member of his family disappears. Well, he gets his wish. Fierce winds causes a power failure, which results in everyone oversleeping. They have only a handful of minutes to get to the airport. Unfortunately for them, they've forgotten Kevin back home because of their hectic departure. Fortunately for Kevin, he now has the freedom to do whatever he wants to do. Things turn for the worse when two robbers (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) prepare to rob the house. And this is where the slapstick comedy comes in. Home Alone isn't just a Christmas movie. Sure, it has some great comedy, but the film goes much deeper than that. It shows the importance of family and family gatherings. It shows that Christmas is not only about fun and gifts, but it's also about love and caring. Anyone can enjoy watching this movie. I, for one, always enjoyed watching it during my childhood, and I still love it as I'm now in my early 20's. If I have kids in the future, then I'll show them this film (and many others) during this time of year.

His older siblings, Buzz (Devin Ratray), Megan (Hillary Wolf) and Jeff (Michael C. Maronna) treat him like a helpless, insignificant piece of dirt; while his parents, Peter (John Heard) and Kate (Catherine O'Hara) are oblivious to everyone's wrongdoings, except for Kevin's. Hence, Kevin wishes that his family would disappear, and they do! Suddenly Kevin is living large, and in charge, as his family has rushed to the airport in a hurry, leaving him behind for the holidays on the third floor. Now there's nothing more for Kevin to do than a little Christmas decorating to get him in the holiday spirit. But Kevin's not decking the halls with mistletoe and tinsel, more like broken glass and paint cans, as a pair of idiot burglars, Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Joe Pesci), dubbed ""The Wet Bandits"" - due to the fact that they stuff the sink with towels, and leave the water running in the homes they burglarize - make a stop in his neighborhood. The main target? Kevin's house. Now it's time for Kevin to protect the home that he loves before the bumbling bandits can steal anything from it, and learn a quick lesson about family.I have watched HOME ALONE every Christmas for years and years, and it never gets tiring. John Hughes - writer and producer - and Chris Columbus - director - are brilliant, and have created a movie that will ultimately go down in history. Macaulay Culkin (SAVED! and UNCLE BUCK) couldn't be better as the unlikely hero, whose life revolves around eating junk food, watching ""rubbish,"" and getting into mischief. Devin Ratray (DENNIS THE MENACE and WORTH WINNING) gives an amazing performance as the annoying, moronic older brother who gets away with everything. While Catherine O'Hara (ORANGE COUNTY and BEETLEJUICE) and John Heard (WHAT THE DEAF MAN HEARD and HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK) were utterly amazing as the clueless parents. With marvelous performances by other actors/actresses such as Gerry Bamman (TWO FAMILY HOUSE and LORENZO's OIL) as Uncle Frank, Macaulay Culkin's real-life younger brother, Kieran Culkin (ONLY THE LONELY and THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS) as Cousin Fuller, John Candy (THE GREAT OUTDOORS and ARMED AND DANGEROUS) as Gus Polinski, the Polka Band Shuttle Chief, and many more, HOME ALONE is sure to offer a little something for everyone.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper",5,"Christmas, Mischief, and Moronic Burglars, Oh My!",1106006400,"01 18, 2005",2005,2565,"['Eight-year-old', 'Kevin', 'McCallister', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'never', 'wanted', 'anything', 'more', 'little', 'R-E-S-P-E-C-T', 'family', 'one', 'thing', 'never', 'succeeded', 'getting', 'older', 'siblings', 'Buzz', 'Devin', 'Ratray', 'Megan', 'Hillary', 'Wolf', 'Jeff', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Maronna', 'treat', 'helpless', 'insignificant', 'piece', 'dirt', 'parents', 'Peter', 'John', 'Heard', 'Kate', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'are', 'oblivious', 'everyone', 'wrongdoings', 'Kevin', 'Hence', 'Kevin', 'family', 'would', 'disappear', 'do', 'Suddenly', 'Kevin', 'living', 'large', 'charge', 'family', 'rushed', 'airport', 'hurry', 'leaving', 'holidays', 'third', 'floor', 'Now', 'nothing', 'more', 'Kevin', 'do', 'little', 'Christmas', 'decorating', 'get', 'holiday', 'spirit', 'Kevin', 'not', 'decking', 'halls', 'mistletoe', 'tinsel', 'more', 'broken', 'glass', 'paint', 'cans', 'pair', 'idiot', 'burglars', 'Marv', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'Harry', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'dubbed', 'Wet', 'Bandits', 'due', 'fact', 'stuff', 'sink', 'towels', 'leave', 'water', 'running', 'homes', 'burglarize', 'make', 'stop', 'neighborhood', 'main', 'target', 'Kevin', 'house', 'Now', 'time', 'Kevin', 'protect', 'home', 'bumbling', 'bandits', 'can', 'steal', 'anything', 'learn', 'quick', 'lesson', 'family.I', 'have', 'watched', 'HOME', 'ALONE', 'Christmas', 'years', 'years', 'never', 'tiring', 'John', 'Hughes', 'writer', 'producer', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'director', 'are', 'brilliant', 'have', 'created', 'movie', 'will', 'ultimately', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'SAVED', 'UNCLE', 'BUCK', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'life', 'eating', 'junk', 'food', 'watching', 'rubbish', 'getting', 'mischief', 'Devin', 'Ratray', 'DENNIS', 'THE', 'MENACE', 'WORTH', 'WINNING', 'amazing', 'performance', 'annoying', 'moronic', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'away', 'everything', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'ORANGE', 'COUNTY', 'BEETLEJUICE', 'John', 'Heard', 'WHAT', 'DEAF', 'MAN', 'HEARD', 'HOME', 'ALONE', '2', 'LOST', 'IN', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'were', 'utterly', 'amazing', 'clueless', 'parents', 'marvelous', 'performances', 'other', 'actors/actresses', 'such', 'Gerry', 'Bamman', 'TWO', 'FAMILY', 'HOUSE', 'LORENZO', 'OIL', 'Uncle', 'Frank', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'real-life', 'younger', 'brother', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', 'ONLY', 'THE', 'LONELY', 'THE', 'DANGEROUS', 'LIVES', 'OF', 'ALTAR', 'BOYS', 'Cousin', 'Fuller', 'John', 'Candy', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'OUTDOORS', 'ARMED', 'AND', 'DANGEROUS', 'Gus', 'Polinski', 'Polka', 'Band', 'Shuttle', 'Chief', 'many', 'more', 'HOME', 'ALONE', 'sure', 'offer', 'little', 'something', 'everyone.Erika', 'SoroccoBook', 'Review', 'Columnist', 'Community', 'Bugle', 'Newspaper']",Home Alone VHS

294980,A31O7B59DW7OHR,6302091632,Gene Bromberg,"[4, 107]","I had a better time watching &quot;Home Alone&quot; in the theater way back when than just about any movie since. Not that I LIKED the movies, heavens no. No, see, I went to see this movie wih a lady friend and I  thought it was totally awful. Culkin was insufferable, Pesci and Stern so  annoying that I wanted to call and fire their agents, and John Hughes  so...John Hughesian. Of course the movie made like $200 million and spawned  two sequels I wouldn't watch unless you duct-taped me to a chair.No,  what made it so fun was going to see it a SECOND time. I told 2 friends how  incredibly awful this movie was and, insulting my fine-tuned sense of  humor, said they wanted to see it right away 'cause if I didn't like it, it  was probably hilarious. So I dared them and they double dared me and off we  went to the SuperSaver theaters (I wasn't giving Hughes any more of my cash  than I had to).It only took 5 minutes for my buddies to realize that  this movie was really a horror show. Once that happened we were all able to  enjoy ourselves. All through the movie we made loud and pointed comments to  the screen, making up dialogue and begging Pesci to smack Culkin over the  head with something heavy and be done with him. The best part was, no one  in the theater found us annoying or told us to shut the (deleted) up.  Instead, everyone (well, 15 folks or so) laughed with us and joined in the  fun. And that's why, I think, that the movie was such a huge hit-- people  hated it so much, it was so nauseating, that people went to see it again  just to insult everyone and everything about it. It's just a theory, but I  think there's some evidence.But life is short and one extra viewing of  &quot;Home Alone&quot; was enough for me. I've never seen it since and  never will again unless someone does the duct-tape thing to me. But for two  blissful hours I had a grand time hating this godawful movie.

This movie is another scam, throw in a cute little boy, give a ridiculous plot and grown men burglars for him to overcome, and you've got the little kids prasing. That's fine. But once you're older, no.First off, this movie is so unrealistic that it's annoying. Give me all of the unhelpful votes you want...I really don't care.1) McCallister's (Mccauley Caulken)parents forget him? How can you forget him on a vacation? Sure, there are lots of people but how could someone forget their own son? Talk about a dysfunctional family. WOW2) McCallister is 8yrs old. Yet somehow, he is smarter than a professional scientist. He can outsmart 2 grown men? How is he so smart? He makes an idiot out of them using his super smart techniques. I mean, seriously, rewatch the movie and look at EVERYTHING HE DOES! Wow, I'm a real idiot compared to this genius kid. His parents should enroll him in college. He looks ready.3) I know that this happens in the 2nd one but I'm not going to waste my time writing a review for this. McCallister drops a brick off a huge building on one of the burglar's heads. WOW. The burglar falls over and gets right up while McCallister is giggling like a moron. He would be dead! This is idiotic stuff that makes little kids think that they could do that in real life. Oh, and little McCallister wouldn't be giggling, he'd be facing some serious charges, I don't care how old he is.Yet somehow, this idiotic movie is one of the highest grossing movies of all time.

295009,A319SKSB556033,6302091632,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[3, 4]","In the Eighties, John Hughes churned out a handful of movies and scored many, many hits. Quite rightly, as most of them were seriously funny - I'm DEFINITELY not referring to Curly Sue, so relax! In one particular scene from Uncle Buck, Macaulay Culkin interrogates a babysitter through the letterbox to make sure she's not a baddie. This inspired Hughes to write a whole new movie. Who would have known that this and its sequel would go on to become two of the biggest hits of all time? Both Hughes and Chris Columbus seem to prefer setting their movies during the holiday season (Gremlins, Young Sherlock Holmes, Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Christmas Vacation) and manage to pull them off without too much sentiment, or sickening amounts of gooey love.There are two reasons why Home Alone was such a big success. The first is that it's about a kid who outsmarts grown-ups, something that happens every day, only there's a worldwide conspiracy of silence. This movie yells it out loud and clear. The second is John Williams's magical score, which elevates the movie way above slapstick family fare to something more serious and regarded. It was nominated for an Academy Award, along with the Christmas carol Somewhere In My Memory, but lost to John Barry's Dances with Wolves. Damn! In a mad rush to the airport one morning, the McCallister family forget one little thing...Kevin (Culkin). He is an eight-year-old kid who wants nothing better than a peaceful Christmas and some time to himself. It's hard for him to get this when living in a house with seven other people(the exact same house from Planes, Trains And Automobiles, don't you know. With the rest of the McCallisters in Paris, Kevin runs wild doing whatever he wants, eating whatever he wants and watching whatever TV show he wants.But there's one major problem. The Wet Bandits, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), are on the prowl and have knocked off every other house in Kevin's street. His is next. And seeing that he's man-of-the-house now, he HAS to defend it.Using whatever tools are at his disposal (rusty nails, blow torches, Micro Machines) he sets up a labyrinth of booby traps, so that the Wets can't break in. Their idiot-proof determination proves to be their downfall, as they are tortured and torn-up upon entering Kevin's domain.Although this is not the only point of the film, there is an important message that family is what really matters to a child, or to anyone, and having them home for the holidays is better than wandering a huge house all by yourself.There are some movies that work best at Christmas and this is one of them. I'm not saying that in a couple of decades it will be the new It's A Wonderful Life (which is very overrated and not really an Xmas movie at all), but it will be remembered fondly at the very least.The Blu Ray looks great in 1.85:1 1080p, and has lots of features.",4,Merry Xmas Ya Filthy Animal,1292544000,"12 17, 2010",2010,2891,"['Eighties', 'John', 'Hughes', 'churned', 'out', 'handful', 'movies', 'scored', 'many', 'many', 'hits', 'Quite', 'rightly', 'most', 'were', 'seriously', 'funny', ""'m"", 'DEFINITELY', 'not', 'referring', 'Curly', 'Sue', 'so', 'relax', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'Uncle', 'Buck', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'babysitter', 'letterbox', 'make', 'sure', 'not', 'baddie', 'inspired', 'Hughes', 'write', 'whole', 'new', 'movie', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'sequel', 'would', 'go', 'become', 'two', 'biggest', 'hits', 'time', 'Hughes', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'seem', 'prefer', 'setting', 'movies', 'holiday', 'season', 'Gremlins', 'Young', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'manage', 'pull', 'off', 'too', 'much', 'sentiment', 'sickening', 'amounts', 'gooey', 'are', 'two', 'reasons', 'why', 'Home', 'Alone', 'was', 'such', 'big', 'success', 'first', 'kid', 'who', 'grown-ups', 'something', 'day', 'only', 'worldwide', 'conspiracy', 'silence', 'movie', 'out', 'loud', 'clear', 'second', 'John', 'Williams', 'magical', 'score', 'movie', 'way', 'slapstick', 'family', 'fare', 'something', 'more', 'serious', 'regarded', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Christmas', 'carol', 'Somewhere', 'My', 'Memory', 'lost', 'John', 'Barry', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Damn', 'mad', 'rush', 'airport', 'one', 'morning', 'McCallister', 'family', 'forget', 'one', 'little', 'thing', 'Kevin', 'Culkin', 'eight-year-old', 'kid', 'who', 'nothing', 'better', 'peaceful', 'Christmas', 'time', 'hard', 'get', 'when', 'living', 'house', 'seven', 'other', 'people', 'exact', 'same', 'house', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'rest', 'McCallisters', 'Paris', 'Kevin', 'wild', 'doing', 'whatever', 'eating', 'whatever', 'watching', 'TV', 'show', 'one', 'major', 'problem', 'Wet', 'Bandits', 'Harry', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Marv', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'are', 'prowl', 'have', 'knocked', 'off', 'other', 'house', 'Kevin', 'street', 'next', 'seeing', 'man-of-the-house', 'now', 'defend', 'it.Using', 'tools', 'are', 'disposal', 'rusty', 'nails', 'blow', 'torches', 'Micro', 'Machines', 'up', 'labyrinth', 'booby', 'traps', 'Wets', 'ca', ""n't"", 'break', 'idiot-proof', 'determination', 'be', 'downfall', 'are', 'tortured', 'torn-up', 'entering', 'Kevin', 'domain.Although', 'not', 'only', 'point', 'film', 'important', 'message', 'family', 'what', 'really', 'child', 'anyone', 'having', 'home', 'holidays', 'better', 'wandering', 'huge', 'house', 'are', 'movies', 'work', 'best', 'Christmas', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'couple', 'decades', 'will', 'be', 'new', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'very', 'overrated', 'not', 'really', 'Xmas', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'fondly', 'very', 'least.The', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'great', '1.85:1', '1080p', 'lots', 'features']",Home Alone VHS

The boy, Kevin, considered to be incompetent, does exploits far beyond his age. Left alone by a big family who goes to Paris for Christmas, he takes care of the big house, does grocery shopping, and stymies two burglars. The burglars think that they will have an easy time with the boy, but instead get the hassle of their lives. A neighbor man, supposedly a murderer who used his snow shovel to kill his relatives, actually lost his relatives to an old, long-unresolved argument.

295067,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6302091632,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","When ever I was teaching any sort of class (in an actual classroom) that involved a look at movies I would do a class discussion where the students were challenged to come up with the Top 25 money making movies of all time (usually without the adjustment for inflation that would put &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; back on top).  Just about every time I did this little exercise in class we would get to the point where there was one spot left open (it used to be in the top ten), and I would tell them it was the biggest money making comedy of all-time and they would keep throwing out names and not getting anywhere and then I would say, okay, I have a clue: but you are going to hate yourselves.  At that point I would slap my hands to my face and scream, at which point the entire classroom would literally groan.But you cannot be the biggest money making comedy of all time (it is now down to #19 in this era of Harry Potter, Frodo, lost fish and Carribean pirates) if nobody enjoyed you, so you have to remember there is actually something funny behind the &quot;Home Alone&quot; backlash (or perhaps it should more properly be called the Macaulay Culkin backlash).  The reason people hate to admit they like this film is because writer-director John Hughes tries to have it three ways.  First, he wants to indulge in the childish fantasy of a kid having the run of the house and being able to do anything he wants.  This is because young Kevin (Culkin) accidentally gets left home behind by his family and is convinced it was because he wished such a thing.  Second, Kevin gets to play the superhero in the end as he turns a normal suburban home into a virtual death trap for the pair of inept burglars who want to make a holiday score.  Third, the story play on the heartstrings not only with the goal of reuniting a little boy with his mother, but through a story involving the nasty old man who lives next door and who Kevin is assured by his older brother is the Snow Shovel Murderer.Those last scenes are important, because Hughes intends to redeem the indulgence of childish dreams and the comic violence with those scenes in which Kevin sends a message to the real Santa Claus through one of his helpers and meets somebody at church.  This touch of heart felt realism at the center of the film's implausibility explains why it is difficult to dismiss &quot;Home Alone.&quot;  At the very least, you have to grant that Hughes was ambitious, and while you are at it you might as well admit that Caulkin was cute.  Hollywood milked that cuteness to death, and the kid has grown up to be another one of those former child actor walking tragedies you hear about all the time, but he is able to play in all three of the ballparks Hughes arranges, which is not bad work for a kid.I have to admit that for the most part I was suckered in by the schmaltz.  When I think fondly about this movie it is about Kevin with his mom (Catherine O'Hara) and Old Man Marley (Roberts Blossom) rather than the over the top antics of the &quot;Wet Bandits&quot; (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern).  Still, the Rube Goldberg devices Kevin uses to defend his home and take out the bad guys is part of a grand tradition that goes back to all those Road Runner cartoons that are clearly the main inspiration for the fun.",4,The most successful film no one wants to admit ever seeing,1070236800,"12 1, 2003",2003,3301,"['When', 'ever', 'was', 'teaching', 'sort', 'class', 'actual', 'classroom', 'involved', 'look', 'movies', 'would', 'do', 'class', 'discussion', 'where', 'students', 'were', 'challenged', 'come', 'up', 'Top', '25', 'money', 'making', 'movies', 'time', 'usually', 'adjustment', 'inflation', 'would', 'put', 'quot', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'quot', 'back', 'top', 'Just', 'time', 'did', 'little', 'exercise', 'class', 'would', 'get', 'point', 'where', 'was', 'one', 'spot', 'left', 'open', 'used', 'be', 'top', 'ten', 'would', 'tell', 'was', 'biggest', 'money', 'making', 'comedy', 'all-time', 'would', 'keep', 'throwing', 'out', 'names', 'not', 'getting', 'anywhere', 'then', 'would', 'say', 'have', 'clue', 'are', 'going', 'hate', 'yourselves', 'point', 'would', 'slap', 'hands', 'face', 'scream', 'point', 'entire', 'classroom', 'would', 'literally', 'groan.But', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'biggest', 'money', 'making', 'comedy', 'time', 'now', 'down', '19', 'era', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Frodo', 'lost', 'fish', 'Carribean', 'pirates', 'nobody', 'enjoyed', 'have', 'remember', 'actually', 'something', 'funny', 'quot', 'Home', 'Alone', 'quot', 'backlash', 'perhaps', 'should', 'more', 'properly', 'be', 'called', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'backlash', 'reason', 'people', 'hate', 'admit', 'film', 'writer-director', 'John', 'Hughes', 'have', 'three', 'ways', 'First', 'indulge', 'childish', 'fantasy', 'kid', 'having', 'run', 'house', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'anything', 'young', 'Kevin', 'Culkin', 'accidentally', 'left', 'home', 'family', 'convinced', 'was', 'wished', 'thing', 'Second', 'Kevin', 'play', 'superhero', 'end', 'normal', 'suburban', 'home', 'virtual', 'death', 'trap', 'pair', 'inept', 'burglars', 'who', 'want', 'make', 'holiday', 'score', 'Third', 'story', 'play', 'heartstrings', 'not', 'only', 'goal', 'reuniting', 'little', 'boy', 'mother', 'story', 'involving', 'nasty', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'next', 'door', 'who', 'Kevin', 'assured', 'older', 'brother', 'Snow', 'Shovel', 'Murderer.Those', 'last', 'scenes', 'are', 'important', 'Hughes', 'redeem', 'indulgence', 'childish', 'dreams', 'comic', 'violence', 'scenes', 'Kevin', 'message', 'real', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'one', 'helpers', 'meets', 'somebody', 'church', 'touch', 'heart', 'felt', 'realism', 'center', 'film', 'implausibility', 'why', 'difficult', 'dismiss', 'quot', 'Home', 'Alone.', 'quot', 'very', 'least', 'have', 'grant', 'Hughes', 'was', 'ambitious', 'are', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'Caulkin', 'was', 'cute', 'Hollywood', 'milked', 'cuteness', 'death', 'kid', 'grown', 'up', 'be', 'one', 'former', 'child', 'actor', 'walking', 'tragedies', 'hear', 'time', 'able', 'play', 'three', 'ballparks', 'Hughes', 'arranges', 'not', 'bad', 'work', 'kid.I', 'have', 'admit', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'suckered', 'schmaltz', 'When', 'think', 'fondly', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'mom', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'Old', 'Man', 'Marley', 'Roberts', 'Blossom', 'rather', 'top', 'antics', 'quot', 'Wet', 'Bandits', 'quot', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'Still', 'Rube', 'Goldberg', 'devices', 'Kevin', 'defend', 'home', 'take', 'out', 'bad', 'guys', 'part', 'grand', 'tradition', 'back', 'Road', 'Runner', 'cartoons', 'are', 'clearly', 'main', 'inspiration', 'fun']",Home Alone VHS

It's about every kids dream and every parents nightmare - (Or is it the revers?) - being left behind by your parents.Starting with a simple wish of making his family dissappear - Micaulay realizes that they actually forgot him on their trip on the way to Paris.Add to the plot two mischievious burglers played brilliantly by Jope Pesci (My Cousin Vinny, With Honors, JFK) and Daniel Stern (City Slickers, My Blue Heaven, Dilbert), they bumble and create havok on the unsuspecting youth trapped alone in his house.The stunts ad gags are hysterical and somewhat not realistic, but the fun and humor is universal. And the appearance of the late John Candy (Wagon's East, JFK, Spaceballs)as the Polka King is hysterical.Key perfomances by the mother and father played by Cathrine O'Hara (Best In Show, Home Fries, The Nightmare Before Christmas) and John Herd (My Fellow Americans, the Pelican Brief, Awakenings) who are incredibly resourceful in getting themselves back from Paris to Chicago to get their son.Funny, adventurous and a lesson in life, love and family.

He uses ice, tar, fire and whatever else he can find in the house to make even something as simple as walking up the stairs or turning a doorknob a dangerous experience for would-be-robbers.In a more serious movie; one that doesn't sugarcoat its violence in slapstick comedy; the two burglars, named The Wet Bandits because one of them likes to clog the sink and leave the water running when they rob a house, would probably be dead. Here, they just hurt and humiliate themselves in amusing ways. There's a scene involving a spider that's actually laugh-out-loud hilarious.What's annoying is the boy, Kevin. I guess he's supposed to be cute, and he might look cute, but the way he acts; the character and the actor who plays him; is the worst thing about the movie. When a Wet Bandit falls victim to one of his pranks, he celebrates with a ""Yes!"" When he glides across a sheet of ice to escape a policeman, he lets out an exaggerated ""Wooah!"" It's just annoying.With that, I think Home Alone would be better if Kevin's character were presented in a more realistic way. I'd also like to see some background to how he's able to come-up with such an ingenius Battle Plan.

On Christmas Eve, me and my family bough it to watch that night. I sat down and watched it, and in the end...It was (or, it is) a pretty fun movie! Most family-oriented films seem to follow a pattern, but this one, well, we can say its a rebel to the normal family-movie stereotype. Its just one of those films that you just want to sit down and watch, if you know what I mean. The acting is pretty good, especially that on the main character, Kevin. Its just at the very beginning that the acting is very ""noticeable"": it seems like everybody in the McAlister household is treating Kevin very badly, and its sort of ""painfully"" obvious that their treating him like that on purpose. But besides that, the acting is outstanding! The plot is just plain awesome, and the action in it (especially  towards the end) is probably the best that you'll ever see from a movie like Home Alone. There are a few remarks that are really not polite or good, but will probably fly right over the heads of most children. Though it might not be a very ""moralized"" story, there are some scenes in it that will probably get you thinking. There's never a dull moment in it, so you'll never get bored with it.Here's the finale prediction that probably sizes the movie up: there may be a few crude remarks, but everything else is completely family-friendly and just plain fun to watch. I know that pretty much everybody has seen this movie, so you can hold whatever opinion that you want.

I remember it was one of my many favourite movies when i was growing up, and it was always fun. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern give tremendous performances in this movie too. The casting is just so perfect..Macaulay Culkin as ""Kevin""..Catherine O'Hara as ""Kevin's Mother""..Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as the frustrated and bumbling burglars..right down to ""Kevin's"" brother, who's name escapes me right now, and John Candy, who has a small part as the ""Polka King of the Midwest"". But really every actor in this movie seems to just be so natural for the parts they play.If you haven't already seen this movie, i suggest you do so as soon as possible. It's truly a classic and will have you laughing at the ingenius ways ""Kevin"" booby-traps his house. The movie starts out with ""Kevin's"" family getting ready for a Christmas Vacation to France, that they'll go on the next morning. ""Kevin"" is left on the outer it seems, as his family have no time for him while they all pack their belongings for the trip. He then gets into a fight with his older brother and is sent up to the attic to spend the night. The next morning, the family sleeps-in and in the hurry to the airport, forgets that Kevin is still up in the attic..The movie really picks up though, when the burglars (Pesci and Stern) finally try and enter the house. Their plan at first seems to be about stealing valuables, but it quickly turns to ""Get that kid!!"", which in turn produces some of the funniest material in a Family/Comedy i've really ever seen. ""Kevin"" is just a genius with how he rigs the house as a massive booby-trap basically, and the burglars are extremely funny with the way they get so frustrated.This DVD also comes with Scene Access, allowing you to immediately go to any scene in the movie without fast-forwarding. It also has Multiple Language Subtitles, and the Original Movie Trailers for Home Alone 1, 2 and 3. With 3, in my personal opinion, being the least appealing of the series.I think this movie is a classic, and will have you laughing along with it until the end. It's a great comedy, that you don't have to watch with anyone if you don't want to. You can watch it by yourself and get just as much enjoyment out of it. I also suggest seeing Home Alone 2, which is a pretty good sequel that keeps most of the same cast from the first movie, such as Macaulay Culkin, Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci to name a few.",5,Very Enjoyable Movie,1116806400,"05 23, 2005",2005,2468,"['recently', 'bought', 'DVD', 'i', 'must', 'say', 'just', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'remember', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'favourite', 'movies', 'when', 'i', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'was', 'always', 'fun', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'give', 'tremendous', 'performances', 'movie', 'too', 'casting', 'just', 'so', 'perfect..Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'Kevin', '..Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'Kevin', 'Mother', '..Joe', 'Pesci', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'frustrated', 'bumbling', 'burglars..right', 'down', 'Kevin', 'brother', 'who', 'name', 'right', 'now', 'John', 'Candy', 'who', 'small', 'part', 'Polka', 'King', 'Midwest', 'really', 'actor', 'movie', 'just', 'be', 'so', 'natural', 'parts', 'play.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'movie', 'i', 'suggest', 'do', 'so', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'truly', 'classic', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'ingenius', 'ways', 'Kevin', 'house', 'movie', 'out', 'Kevin', 'family', 'getting', 'ready', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'France', ""'ll"", 'go', 'next', 'morning', 'Kevin', 'left', 'outer', 'family', 'have', 'time', 'pack', 'belongings', 'trip', 'then', 'fight', 'older', 'brother', 'sent', 'up', 'attic', 'spend', 'night', 'next', 'morning', 'family', 'sleeps-in', 'hurry', 'airport', 'Kevin', 'still', 'up', 'attic..The', 'movie', 'really', 'up', 'though', 'when', 'burglars', 'Pesci', 'Stern', 'finally', 'try', 'enter', 'house', 'plan', 'first', 'be', 'stealing', 'valuables', 'quickly', 'Get', 'kid', 'turn', 'funniest', 'material', 'Family/Comedy', 'i', ""'ve"", 'really', 'ever', 'seen', 'Kevin', 'just', 'genius', 'how', 'house', 'massive', 'booby-trap', 'basically', 'burglars', 'are', 'extremely', 'funny', 'way', 'get', 'so', 'frustrated.This', 'DVD', 'also', 'Scene', 'Access', 'allowing', 'immediately', 'go', 'scene', 'movie', 'fast-forwarding', 'also', 'Multiple', 'Language', 'Subtitles', 'Original', 'Movie', 'Trailers', 'Home', 'Alone', '1', '2', '3', '3', 'personal', 'opinion', 'being', 'least', 'appealing', 'series.I', 'think', 'movie', 'classic', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'end', 'great', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'watch', 'anyone', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'can', 'watch', 'get', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'also', 'suggest', 'seeing', 'Home', 'Alone', '2', 'pretty', 'good', 'sequel', 'most', 'same', 'cast', 'first', 'movie', 'such', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'name', 'few']",Home Alone VHS

295125,A1RZ1KIP4LJYDZ,6302091632,"moviefreak ""moviefreak2003""","[0, 2]","Home Alone, staring Macaulay Culkin (Home Alone 2) and directed by Chris Columbus (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), is a childish movie.  A very childish movie.  One that succeeds in entertaining but something that you enjoy as a little kid and laugh at when you're an adult.  Even the concept of the movie is dumb.  Like I said, it is not funny, it's just entertaining.  Let me tell you something comedy fans:  Seeing adults being destroyed by a ten year old child does not sound so ""realistic"" to me.  Otherwise, it's a pure treat for the whole family.Home Alone tells the story of Kevin McCallister, a ten year old boy who finds that his parents accidentally left him behind during their trip.  Just when he starts to celebrate, he discovers that the Wet Bandits (Joe Pesci, Goodfellas, and Daniel Stern, Bushwhacked), a group of robbers, are in his neighborhood.  After seeing numerous wanted reports on TV, Kevin decides to take on the Wet Bandits.  The last twenty minutes of the movie shows us the colossal battle between Kevin and the Wet Bandits.  Since this is a children's movie, the children always win and that's what makes this movie way too predictable.Despite the Wet Bandit's stupidity, Home Alone will not disappoint.  Kids surely will enjoy it but parents, I suggest you slowly sneak out of the room.  Besides, there's nothing really violent in the film except the fight between Kevin and the bandits though it doesn't even include one drop of blood.  I think movie is loved by kids not because of it's actors but because of the violence.  Kids today hardly ever see a red-blooded R-rated action movie and this is like a free ticket to seeing people getting beat up.  Especially by a kid.  What also disappoints me about the movie is that Macaulay Culkin overpowers the adults and bandits in intelligence.  Several plans, such as Culkin setting up a room of cardboard figures to confuse the robbers, is simply not believable and a normal child could not possible make up these ideas.  This was not a screenplay meant for John Hughes but oh well.  The performances are satisfying but not excellent and the script is OK.

The setting is an upper class family who is going on vacation.  Everything happens to work out in order for them to accidentally leave their youngest child at home.  The electricity goes out, making them in a rush, the neighbor's little boy comes over to talk (asking the van drivers 50 million annoying questions) and they end up counting him and therefore assume that the whole family is there.  Kevin, the 8 year old is left alone to fend for himself.  To complicate matters two criminals are looking to break into his house.  The movie is funny as heck as an 8-year-old tries to outwit 2 adult criminals.  One of the most hilarious moments is when Kevin orders some pizza and uses a VHR video to scare the living tar out of the pizza driver.  Not only is the movie funny but also it shows how people can take their family for granted.  After a little while of being alone, Kevin regrets his wish that his family would disappear and his mother does everything, including riding in a truck with a bunch of jazz musicians to get home.

295155,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6302091632,Reviewer,"[1, 2]","Take a cheeky eight-year-old, put him in a situation he has to slapstick his way out of with the kind of antics most cartoon characters wouldn't survive, and what you have is one of the most wildly popular, commercially successful comedies of all time.  And when it's over, though most likely you'll have had a good time, you'll be tempted to ask the question:  Why?  Because ""Home Alone,"" directed by Chris Columbus and written by John Hughes, is mediocre at best, though it does have it's moments.  It's a matter of the filmmakers being very astute, perhaps, and wisely mixing in a potpourri of elements with universal appeal and touching upon that common nerve they calculated would give just about anyone in the audience something to which they could relate.  And they were right.  Kids, Christmas, family, vacation, independence, a scary situation; it's all in here.  But, interestingly enough, it lacks the sentimental value that would seemingly have made this a movie one could truly embrace.  As it is, it's engaging fare, but somehow manages to keep the viewer at arm's length.  Then again, maybe that's even part of the appeal; it may be that audiences at this particular time and place were more comfortable just watching without having to invest anything of themselves in order to have a good time.This was, after all, 1990, and this film played to a generation weaned on more than a decade of Saturday Night Live, whose keen sense of biting satire and parody definitely had an influence on the mind-set of audiences everywhere.  And is that a bad thing?  No, absolutely not.  It merely points up one possible reason why a film centered around an eight-year-old with a somewhat derisive attitude could be so wholeheartedly received.  Also, it may be that the second half of the film, with it's over-the-top slapstick, is what made the final impression on the audience.  And this IS funny stuff; and it's going to get to even those who usually prefer humor that doesn't involve slapstick, because it's so well done.  Again, credit the filmmakers with having their fingers on the pulse of our culture and standards at the time.  But you also have to give credit to Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who bring the ""Wet Bandits,"" Harry and Marv,  to life, and know how to put across this kind of comedy, which is no easy task.The story itself is simple:  The extended McCallister family sets off for a Christmas vacation in Paris, and inadvertently, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) gets left behind.  Left alone.  At home.  Where, rising to the occasion beyond anything even the most prodigious teenager could manage, he discovers the thrill of being independent and thwarts a pair of bungling burglars in the balance.  Meanwhile, mom and dad (Catherine O'Hara as Kate, John Heard as Peter) go out of their minds when they get to Paris and discover what has happened.  If only they knew what an ingenious and imaginative son they had...Culkin is certainly a cute kid, but can he act?  Well, the jury is still out on that one.  It's hard to say, since the dialogue he is given is so ridiculously above that of an eight-year-old, and the situations he encounters are so far-fetched, that there is no real frame of reference by which to consider it objectively.  His timing and rhythm are lacking, however, that much is clear.  His responses-- or, if you will, the punch lines he delivers-- are always a beat behind what they should be.  And it robs the humor of the spontaneity that would have made it funnier, even hilarious.  As it is, the only real laughs come from Kevin's assault on the Wet Bandits, and there are plenty to be had there.Pesci and Stern become the real stars of the show as they play out their slapstick antics, which are truly deserving of the laughs they generate.  Their expressions of incredulity in the face of the violence that is visited upon them is what makes this movie.  Everything else merely sets the stage for Harry and Marv's descent into the maelstrom.  And what Pesci and Stern do here should not be taken for granted, nor taken lightly artistically.  To put this kind of humor across takes some real talent on the part of consummate professionals, and Pesci and Stern certainly deliver it.  Their secret?  They play it straight, which keeps the silliness out of it.  Had they played it strictly as farce, it simply wouldn't have had the same impact; but by playing to the characters in the situation, rather than to a situation involving characters, it works.  And, once again, chalk up another one for Columbus and Hughes, who really know how to deliver this kind of material.The only truly poignant moment in the film involves Kevin's encounter with a mysterious neighbor, ""Old Man Marley,"" played wonderfully by character actor/poet Roberts Blossom.  The revelation of his secret earlier in the film sets up the purest moment of the ending, and though it is brief, it's inspired and adds a much needed perspective to the story.The supporting cast includes Devin Ratray (Buzz), Angela Goethals (Linnie), Gerry Bamman (Uncle Frank), Hillary Wolf (Aunt Leslie), Ralph Foody (Gangster Johnny), Billie Bird (Irene), Bill Erwin (Ed) and John Candy, memorable in the role of Gus Polinski, the Polka Band shuttle Chief.  Considering the ratio between this movie's substance and the success it still enjoys today, ""Home Alone"" is something of an anomaly in the history of the genre.  it lacks insight, yet delivers some real belly laughs.  It lacks a single character the audience can truly embrace, yet is accepted overwhelmingly as is.  It lacks inspiration, yet is an inspired film in the way it is crafted and delivered.  It's one you're probably going to like and enjoy, but upon reflection may wonder, ""Why.""  And the answer?  Who can say.  Go figure.  It's the magic of the movies.",3,Sometimes You Have To Ask Yourself A Question...,1008633600,"12 18, 2001",2001,5812,"['Take', 'cheeky', 'eight-year-old', 'put', 'situation', 'slapstick', 'way',

His mother Kate (Catherine O'Hara, also creating a memorable performance) interacts with those characters in her attempt to get back home to Kevin. John Candy and Catherine O'Hara are great together in their scenes. Mac does meet his next door neighbor (played by Roberts Blossom) and has a touching scene in the church with him later on.

One day, he gets into it with his older brother, and Kevin ends up being punished. During his punishment, he wishes that he could spend a christmas by himself without any of his family members. Wouldn't you know it - due to his family's carelessness, they accidently leave Kevin home on their way to the airport (to fly to Paris for Christmas vacation.)And from there, the fun begins. While Kevin is home by himself, two bumbling, nincompoop burglars (played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) known as the ""Wet Bandits,"" set their sites on Kevin's house. When Kevin figures this out, he sets the house up with all sorts of tricks and traps, to out-maneuver these two clowns. And it's *hilarious* (listening to Daniel Stern's agonized wails -- as if he were castrated -- leaves me gasping for breath!) Anytime I watch this movie, these scenes in general have a way of bringing out the devilishly-maniacal, mischievous kid in me (and no doubt, many other viewers as well.) Of course, the movie isn't all about brash, goofy slapstick; there are some moving moments scattered throughout the film (particularly when Kevin befriends an old man - who is feared throughout the neighborhood - who teaches Kevin a few things about life, as well as receiving a little bit of advice from young Kevin along the way.)Home Alone, Home Alone 2, and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation are the Christmas comedies I find myself coming back to most. Indeed, all three of these films are classics that should be watched around the holidays, or *any* time of the year, for some non-stop entertainment & laughs, as well as some heartwarming sentiment beneath it all.",5,It Will Never Wear Out It's Welcome!,1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,2011,"['movie', 'was', 'favorite', 'amongst', 'many', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1990', 'more', 'decade', 'later', 'movie', '*still*', 'classic', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'classic', 'many', 'more', 'years', 'come.The', 'story', 'simple', 'really', 'young', 'Kevin', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'underdog', 'family', 'always', 'getting', 'picked', 'older', 'siblings', 'feeling', 'outcast', 'One', 'day', 'older', 'brother', 'Kevin', 'up', 'being', 'punished', 'punishment', 'could', 'spend', 'christmas', 'family', 'members', 'Would', ""n't"", 'know', 'due', 'family', 'carelessness', 'accidently', 'leave', 'Kevin', 'home', 'way', 'airport', 'fly', 'Paris', 'Christmas', 'vacation', 'there', 'fun', 'Kevin', 'home', 'two', 'bumbling', 'nincompoop', 'burglars', 'played', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'known', 'Wet', 'Bandits', 'set', 'sites', 'Kevin', 'house', 'When', 'Kevin', 'out', 'house', 'up', 'sorts', 'tricks', 'traps', 'out-maneuver', 'two', 'clowns', '*hilarious*', 'listening', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'agonized', 'wails', 'were', 'castrated', 'gasping', 'breath', 'Anytime', 'watch', 'movie', 'scenes', 'general', 'have', 'way', 'bringing', 'out', 'devilishly-maniacal', 'mischievous', 'kid', 'doubt', 'many', 'other', 'viewers', 'well', 'course', 'movie', ""n't"", 'brash', 'goofy', 'slapstick', 'are', 'moving', 'moments', 'scattered', 'film', 'particularly', 'when', 'Kevin', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'feared', 'neighborhood', 'who', 'Kevin', 'few', 'things', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'receiving', 'little', 'bit', 'advice', 'young', 'Kevin', 'way', 'Home', 'Alone', 'Home', 'Alone', '2', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'are', 'Christmas', 'comedies', 'find', 'coming', 'back', 'most', 'Indeed', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'classics', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'holidays', '*any*', 'time', 'year', 'non-stop', 'entertainment', 'laughs', 'as', 'well', 'heartwarming', 'sentiment', 'beneath']",Home Alone VHS

295179,A2UGVZFKH8O5X4,6302091632,Sean Parauka,"[5, 7]","In 1990, another Christmas movie classic was made. This movie, ""Home Alone"" is a holiday classic that you can't find anywhere else. The cast is great, the scenes are hilarious, and it's wonderful family movie. Macaulay Culkin starts his fame as the family icon for parents and thier children.The movie starts out in Chicago, IL at the McCillister house. Here we meet Kevin's family that is running all over the house preparing for their Christmas trip to Paris. Also in the house scoping out the place is Harry (Joe Pesci), a crook posed a cop that is planning on robbing the house after they leave. Now here is where the problems start. When the whole family is eating pizza for dinner, Kevin (Culkin) is looking around for his plain cheese pizza because that's all he eats. So his older brother Buzz (Devin Ratray) eats it on purpose. Then Kevin attacks him and the place becomes a mess and soda is spilled and the passports are soaked, etc. Kevin's mother Kate (Caterine O'Hara) sends him to his room. In Kevin's state of anger he says to his mother that he doesn't want to see his family again. Now while in bed Kevin says, ""I wish they would all dissapear."" During the night the power goes out and the alarm clocks goes out. The next moring they are rushing left and right to get to the airport. Here's the problem: THEY FORGOT KEVIN!Now kevin wakes up an sees nobody is home. He actually thinks that his wish came true. Now at first Kevin loves this. He jumps on the bed, shoots his brother Buzz's BB gun, takes his brother's life savings, and eats all the junk food in the world and watches ""R"" rated films. While the family is on the plane, Kevin's mother gets the feeling they forgot something. Kevin's father Peter (John Heard) asks her, ""What could we have forgotten?"" Then Kate screams: KEVIN! Now while Kevin still is having fun back at home, the family is in Paris trying to get a flight back home. and calling the police, etc.One day, Kevin goes out shopping and spots a misterious van in the neighbor's driveway. It's the crooks. Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Pesci), The Wet Bandits. Now after Kevin actually goes out shopping to get food and milk, he notices the guys in the van. Now he realizes they are after his house. Sorry Christmas Eve night he plans his battle against the crooks.The gadgets and the tricks he pulls on the crooks are undoubtably hilarious. First, when the crooks starts talking to Kevin through the back door pretending to be Santa Claus and an Elf, Kevin takes his borther's BB gun and sticks it through the cathole and shoots Harry is the lower region. Then Marv sticks his heasd through the cathole and he gets shot in the head. Now there is ice on all the stairways, the front door knob is burning hot and when Hary touches the knob, the knob's inprinted ""M"" is impronted into Harry's hand. Lol! Then in the basement there is tar paper on the stairs and eventually there is a nail sticking up which Marv steps on with his bare foot. See what other tricks Kevin has got up his sleeve.This movie, ""Home Alone"" is the perfect holiday movie that the entire family can enjoy. It's another Christmas classic. One thing this movie does for me is it gets me into the holiday spirit. In the beginning when Kevin said he didn't want to see his family again, throughout the movie, you realize how important family is, especially around the holidays. Buy this movie for you and your kids and you will love it as much as I do. Merry Christmas!

295191,AKP40TIE5SVSQ,6302091632,Some Gravity,"[0, 1]","The movie industry has seen all kinds of great Christmas films,and one of those films happens to be,by far,""Home Alone"". Truth be told,while ""Home Alone"" may not have the Christmas spirit that other classic Christmas films such as ""The Santa Claus"" and ""A Christmas Story"" have,its own unique Christmas spirit,blended in with a dark,rebellious side,make it an instant Christmas classic....one of the best Christmas films EVER released.Here,Macaulay Culkin (in his first major role,following his minor role in ""Uncle Buck"")stars as Kevin McCallister. And despite the fact that Kevin is only eight years old,Kevin being the youngest in his large and rich family makes him the family outcast. Yes,even Kevin's parents,Peter (John Heard)and Kate (Catherine O'Hara)allow Kevin to be the outcast in the family and don't even take his side in a family argument that involves Kevin. This is what leads into to Kevin being an unhappy and dissatisfied child.However,one day,Kevin finds himself happiness and freedom. This is when his parents,after sleeping in,hustle the whole family together to fly to Paris for Christmas. After forgetting to wake up Kevin and a miscounting of the family,Kevin is left home alone without the rest of the family. And,while Peter and Kate McCallister are left searching frantically for Kevin once they discover they left him behind,things are different for Kevin. Kevin,who is glad that he has freedom from his disliked family,decides to take advantage of being home alone,with only one thing to worry about:his neighbor,""Old Man"" Marley (Roberts Blossom),who is believed to be a murderer.And then,once Kevin finds that he is safe from Marley,more worries for Kevin arise--which,this time,find Kevin having to take action. This is when a couple of infamous and unintelligent Chicago burglars,The Wet Bandits,consisting of Harry(Joe Pesci)and Marv(Daniel Stern),begin keeping their eye on Kevin's house (think a smaller White House in this instance),hoping to rob it. Kevin is able to save himself a few times and trick Harry and Marv. But,when Harry and Marv pay more closer attention to the house and realize that Kevin is home alone,the party begins,with Harry and Marv finding themselves up against Kevin once they have entered Kevin's house,and are finding themselves losing the little ""war"" that Kevin has launched against them with his so-called booby traps.The one thing that people continue to question about ""Home Alone"" is the fact that it has so-called ""violence"" in it. Unless you do not want your child watching any film that has any way,shape,or form of violence in it,this film is nothing to worry about otherwise. The violence here is minor violence to the point of being childish,and helps the film both entertaining and suitable,while it works well for the black comedy feel that the plot for this film has to it. So,if you want a nice Christmas film with good humor and good actors (John Candy even has a small role in this film),""Home Alone"" is one film that is not to be missed out on,especially during the holiday and the excellent bonus feautures that this DVD has on it (the VHS version of this movie works fine,but has no bonus feautures on it at all--what a dissapointment),along with well-written holiday values and essential lessons,at the same time.",4,A Christmas classic.....with a dark side!!!,1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,3301,"['movie', 'industry', 'seen', 'kinds', 'great', 'Christmas', 'films', 'one', 'films', 'be', 'far', 'Home', 'Alone', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'Home', 'Alone', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'other', 'classic', 'Christmas', 'films', 'such', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'have', 'own', 'unique', 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'blended', 'dark', 'rebellious', 'side', 'make', 'instant', 'Christmas', 'classic', '.one', 'best', 'Christmas', 'films', 'EVER', 'released.Here', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'following', 'minor', 'role', 'Uncle', 'Buck', 'Kevin', 'McCallister', 'fact', 'Kevin', 'only', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'Kevin', 'being', 'youngest', 'large', 'rich', 'family', 'family', 'outcast', 'Yes', 'even', 'Kevin', 'parents', 'Peter', 'John', 'Heard', 'Kate', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'allow', 'Kevin', 'be', 'outcast', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'take', 'side', 'family', 'argument', 'Kevin', 'what', 'Kevin', 'being', 'unhappy', 'dissatisfied', 'child.However', 'one', 'day', 'Kevin', 'happiness', 'freedom', 'when', 'parents', 'sleeping', 'hustle', 'whole', 'family', 'together', 'fly', 'Paris', 'Christmas', 'forgetting', 'wake', 'up', 'Kevin', 'miscounting', 'family', 'Kevin', 'left', 'home', 'alone', 'rest', 'family', 'Peter', 'Kate', 'McCallister', 'are', 'left', 'searching', 'frantically', 'Kevin', 'once', 'discover', 'left', 'things', 'are', 'different', 'Kevin', 'Kevin', 'who', 'glad', 'freedom', 'disliked', 'family', 'take', 'advantage', 'being', 'home', 'alone', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'worry', 'neighbor', 'Old', 'Man', 'Marley', 'Roberts', 'Blossom', 'who', 'believed', 'be', 'murderer.And', 'then', 'once', 'Kevin', 'safe', 'Marley', 'more', 'worries', 'Kevin', 'arise', 'time', 'find', 'Kevin', 'having', 'take', 'action', 'when', 'couple', 'infamous', 'unintelligent', 'Chicago', 'burglars', 'Wet', 'Bandits', 'consisting', 'Harry', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Marv', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'begin', 'keeping', 'eye', 'Kevin', 'house', 'think', 'smaller', 'White', 'House', 'instance', 'hoping', 'rob', 'Kevin', 'able', 'save', 'few', 'times', 'trick', 'Harry', 'Marv', 'when', 'Harry', 'Marv', 'pay', 'more', 'closer', 'attention', 'house', 'realize', 'Kevin', 'home', 'alone', 'party', 'Harry', 'Marv', 'finding', 'up', 'Kevin', 'once', 'have', 'entered', 'Kevin', 'house', 'are', 'finding', 'losing', 'little', 'war', 'Kevin', 'launched', 'so-called', 'booby', 'one', 'thing', 'people', 'continue', 'question', 'Home', 'Alone', 'fact', 'so-called', 'violence', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'child', 'watching', 'film', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'violence', 'film', 'nothing', 'worry', 'otherwise', 'violence', 'here', 'minor', 'violence', 'point', 'being', 'childish', 'film', 'entertaining', 'suitable', 'well', 'black', 'comedy', 'feel', 'plot', 'film', 'So', 'want', 'nice', 'Christmas', 'film', 'good', 'humor', 'good', 'actors', 'John', 'Candy', 'even', 'small', 'role', 'film', 'Home', 'Alone', 'one', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'out', 'especially', 'holiday', 'excellent', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'version', 'movie', 'fine', 'bonus', 'what', 'dissapointment', 'well-written', 'holiday', 'values', 'essential', 'lessons', 'same', 'time']",Home Alone VHS

295193,A3DY46ZABF4CMQ,6302091632,"S. Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[2, 4]","Home Alone is a brilliant comedy produced by John Hughes (The Breakfast Club), directed by Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire), and starring child sensation Macaulay Culkin (Uncle Buck), Joe Pesci (Goodfellas), Daniel Stern (City Slickers), John Heard (187), and Catherine O'Hara (Beetlejuice).Home Alone is not only the highest grossing comedy of all time, (the movie has made more than 500 million dollars worldwide to date), but it is also the film that made Macaulay Culkin, who was only about 9 years old at the time of the film's release, a household name and an international mega star overnight.Home Alone is about a child named Kevin McCallister, one of the many children of the upper-middle class and very eccentric Chicago suburbanites McCallisters, played by Heard and O'Hara, who accidentally is left behind by his huge family when they rush to the airport on their way to spend the winter break in France, so Kevin finds himself alone at home, hence the title. In the meantime, two scheming and rather stupid burglars: Harry, played by Pesci, and Marvin, played by Stern, are going house to house in Kevin's neighborhood stealing everything they can. They set their eyes on the McCallister home because as Harry describes, it is the silver platter. However, Harry and Marvin are in for a surprise and lots of pain as Kevin is smarter than they think.Home Alone is flat-out hilarious. John Hughes, the man behind such 80's comedy classics as Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club, and Uncle Buck, continues his string of Chicago based movies with Home Alone. There are several signature Hughes elements in the film: in addition to the Chicago theme, there is the scene where Kevin talks to himself in the bathroom mirror, right before he puts aftershave and screams (the movie's most copied signature scene). This is a reference to Ferris Bueller's Day Off, where Ferris, played by Matthew Broderick, breaks the 'fourth wall' and speaks directly the viewers.Almost 16 years after its release, Home Alone is still one of the most popular family comedies ever made.RecommendedA",5,You've never heard of nor watched Home Alone?

I like this films for many reasons, the first being that it is somewhat of a dream for every child, or person who used to be a child, to want their family to disappear and have the whole house to themselves. Anyway, the idea of Kevin being left behind while the family takes a trip to Paris is very unlikely, but in the way it's portrayed in the film at least it's theoretically possible. Kevin busies himself having fun and doing all the things he ever wanted to do around the house. However, two very inept burglars, Harry and Marv, have his house targeted. I like the way Kevin is portrayed as a kid who doesn't fit in with his family, and wishes they were gone, only to find himself missing them soon after they leave.The comedy in the film is great, with moments I still find myself laughing at. The music by John Williams is another definate plus, mixing his own music with contemporary and classic Christmas songs, the climax sequence is still the best, and not too over the top. One thing I really liked is how, once Kevin's family leaves, he's in his own world, which involves Old Man Marley and Marv and Harry. Once the crooks are hauled off to jail, Kevin's parents come home and there's no evidence to suggest that things were ever different, except for one gold tooth.

295208,A2J00K3J9KPQD3,6302091632,The Dread Pirate Pastor Muppets,"[0, 5]","I believe I'm one of the last people in the world to see this film for the very first time, but never in my life has Chris Columbus's Home Alone struck me as interesting. Oh yes, it does have an interesting concept: being left home alone for an extended period of time is a scary notion. But the film suffers from laziness by a once great screenwriter in John Hughes (Ferris Bueller's Day Off) and a thoughtful premise tossed aside for an insufferable protagonist and awful slapstick.When it was first released, Home Alone made half of a billion dollars worldwide at the box office, second place behind Ghost. Critics were divided on it, but since its 1990 release, it's gone on to be a loved family film that makes you laugh and warms your heart. For myself, it did neither. Some of Hughes' earlier films, most notably Ferris Bueller, did make me laugh, and they were very enjoyable. This time, an idiotic script ruins an interesting setup.We are introduced to our hero, 8-year old Kevin McAllister (Macaulay Culkin), as he and his family are preparing for a Christmas trip in France. While everybody else is getting ready, Kevin is begging for attention because he doesn't know how to pack a suitcase. But instead of helping him, the rest of the family shuns him. This may seem cold, but I didn't care one bit because Kevin is just about one of the smuggest, conceited little brats I've ever seen in a film. And since he's just so much of a jerk (which his uncle calls him out on), he deserves to get yelled at.Kevin is my biggest problem with the film, and it goes a long way: a little rambunctiousness is fine. Kids are stubborn and adventurous, and impatience is most certainly expected out of them. But Kevin, for however much Culkin tries (he's not an appealing presence in the first place), is still an pigheaded little imp whose tedious adventure does not spark my interest or delight in the very least.His family leaves him behind in confusion when the power goes out on them and they just barely make the plane. At this, two bandits (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) break into the house and try to steal all of the beloved possessions as they did with a few other houses. But Kevin is ready to stop them with booby traps that act as the slapstick, but just come off as cruel ploy.Pesci is at his very best when he is screaming, cursing, and about ready to blow up in somebody's face. He would win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas, which came out the same year as Home Alone. Of course, Chris Columbus is no Martin Scorsese. And this film does not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Goodfellas; but it must serve as a comparison for the two Pesci performances, and frankly, his home robber sucks. Especially when compared to his gangster.Stern directed a cute baseball film called Rookie of the Year in 1993, where he also played a confused yet very funny pitching coach. He also does not show off his talent here, and has been much better elsewhere. He and Pesci are the poor victims of not only terrible screenwriting, but also awful slapstick. The traps that Kevin sets for the robbers look as if designed to kill them, not to catch them. But Columbus turns the film into a cartoon by showing that smashing your head on the floor is humorous. Instead of being threatened with a gun (belonging to Kevin's brother Buzz), Pesci and Stern are the objects of cartoon violence in real life. It is not realistic, and therefore not funny.Besides its jerk hero and forgettable supporting cast, the film suffers from far too many moments of sentimentality. This is a film where Kevin learns finally to stop being a jerk, think for himself, and begin to take some responsibility. But at no point in Home Alone do I begin to even care about the kid or anything that happens to him; and I could really care less when he apologizes to his family and warms everybody's hearts. Columbus and Hughes pull at our heartstrings in a way that makes Disney's Pinocchio look like Hitchcock's Psycho.Sentimentality at times is tolerable, but when a protagonist is a hotheaded little lump, there needs to be something that makes us care about the characters or plot. But the filmmakers really don't know what that is, and therefore can't do anything better than to say, ""We forgive you, Kevin. You're the brightest star in our sky.""On a more positive note: one of the most memorable aspects of Home Alone is the score by John Williams, and the film contains his best work of the 1990s outside of Jurassic Park and Schindler's List. It improves the film, but sadly, not by much.There is some creativity to the film and begs the question: what it is like to be home alone for an extended period of time? Well in real life, I don't think it would look anything like this. The violence is too cartoony and unfunny, and Kevin is such an obstinate, unappealing little jerk whose actions are of no interest or consideration to me. What's most depressing however was that it was enormously successful, more than enough to warrant a sequel, a film I actually saw before this one. And it is of equal evil and triteness.4/10",2,"Unrealistic, manipulative, and quite shameful",1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,5142,"['believe', ""'m"", 'one', 'last', 'people', 'world', 'see', 'film',

This DVD edition is the long awaited special edition to one of cinemas most adored Christmas films. This edition offers a hefty amount of extra goodies...such as over 30 minutes of deleted scenes, on the set featurettes, new interviews, and a brand new commentary track featuring director Chris Columbus & Macaulay Culkin. I have to say unlike most commentary tracks, this one is actully very informative and very fun. Macaulay and Chris seem to have so much fun watching the film. This edition like the first one is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1. I read somewhere that the video and audio is updated too, I cannot confirm if it is or not but I read that. If you own the previous edition of this film, it is definately worth your money to update to this. The special features alone warrant a double dip. Also for the hold outs not wanting to buy the film til it got a special edition, well here it is. I would recommend this edition to anyone wanting to own this classic film on DVD.",5,Home Alone - Family Fun Edition,1192492800,"10 16, 2007",2007,1096,"['November', '21st', '2006', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'released', 'Home', 'Alone', 'Family', 'Fun', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'edition', 'long', 'awaited', 'special', 'edition', 'one', 'cinemas', 'most', 'adored', 'Christmas', 'films', 'edition', 'hefty', 'amount', 'extra', 'goodies', 'such', '30', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'set', 'featurettes', 'new', 'interviews', 'brand', 'new', 'commentary', 'track', 'featuring', 'director', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'have', 'say', 'most', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'one', 'actully', 'very', 'informative', 'very', 'fun', 'Macaulay', 'Chris', 'seem', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watching', 'film', 'edition', 'first', 'one', 'presented', 'original', 'theatrical', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1', 'read', 'somewhere', 'video', 'audio', 'updated', 'too', 'can', 'not', 'confirm', 'not', 'read', 'own', 'previous', 'edition', 'film', 'definately', 'worth', 'money', 'update', 'special', 'features', 'alone', 'warrant', 'double', 'dip', 'Also', 'hold', 'not', 'wanting', 'buy', 'film', 'til', 'got', 'special', 'edition', 'well', 'here', 'would', 'recommend', 'edition', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'own', 'classic', 'film', 'DVD']",Home Alone VHS

We chose to watch it because we both had just watched (for free) &#34;Home Alone 3&#34;---which I thought would surely be total junk. The odd thing is---we both really liked the &#34;third installment.&#34; It was ridiculous---hilariously ridiculous. We both howled with laughter. It's a &#34;total cartoon.&#34; Now---you may dismiss my review, but I am here to tell you that my 6 year old felt the same way. He LOVED &#34;Home Alone 3,&#34; but &#34;Home Alone,&#34; downloaded for $3.99, was ho-hum in contrast. The movie always aggravated me with its gratuitous &#34;Ahhhhhhhh&#34; from Culkin, but its biggest offense is that it tries to be a cartoon and real movie at the same time. I'm sorry, but I feel one has to choose sides.

295224,AOUEOXRQJDK3S,6302091632,Xavier H.,"[1, 2]","Despite the fact that Home Alone has been on TV every Christmas season for the last 10 or so years, this DVD is still worth owning as it gives you so much more to experience past the actual movie itself.As someone who cherishes this movie from his childhood and is now an adult, the audio commentary on the movie (featuring Macaulay Culkin himself!) is a surprisingly humorous take on a kids' movie from an adult perspective. It also provided a lot of information about the difficulties of making the movie. Because Home Alone is such a widely known movie nowadays, it's hard to imagine that it started out as an incredibly low-budget, zero-reputation affair which many people thought would flop. I think this speaks to how the film industry has changed over the years, something which is good to hear for both younger and older generations.The other special features are incredible as well, from top to bottom. This really is a ""family fun edition"" because it has something that can be enjoyed by everyone . The various trivia games (3 in all) are still challenging no matter how many times you've seen the movie. The featurettes, which range from an overall ""making of Home Alone"" to specifics on the stunts, Macaulay's own video diary from the set, and an incredibly humorous ""Where's Buzz Now?"" are all amazing additions which are lacking from just about every 90's movie released on DVD in the modern times. My favorite feature is the alternate takes and deleted scenes. Each one adds a new dimension to the movie and you really feel like it's an utter shame that each one didn't make it past the editing room floor.Especially with the new holiday season upon us, this is definitely something to add to your collection and is a great value for your dollar.",5,"It's STILL great, almost 20 years later!",1259884800,"12 4, 2009",2009,1761,"['fact', 'Home', 'Alone', 'been', 'TV', 'Christmas', 'season', 'last', '10', 'so', 'years', 'DVD', 'still', 'worth', 'owning', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'experience', 'actual', 'movie', 'itself.As', 'someone', 'who', 'movie', 'childhood', 'now', 'adult', 'audio', 'commentary', 'movie', 'featuring', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'surprisingly', 'humorous', 'take', 'kids', 'movie', 'adult', 'perspective', 'also', 'provided', 'lot', 'information', 'difficulties', 'making', 'movie', 'Home', 'Alone', 'such', 'widely', 'known', 'movie', 'nowadays', 'hard', 'imagine', 'started', 'out', 'incredibly', 'low-budget', 'zero-reputation', 'affair', 'many', 'people', 'thought', 'would', 'flop', 'think', 'how', 'film', 'industry', 'changed', 'years', 'something', 'good', 'hear', 'younger', 'older', 'generations.The', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'incredible', 'well', 'top', 'bottom', 'really', 'family', 'fun', 'edition', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'everyone', 'various', 'trivia', 'games', '3', 'are', 'still', 'challenging', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'featurettes', 'range', 'overall', 'making', 'Home', 'Alone', 'specifics', 'stunts', 'Macaulay', 'own', 'video', 'diary', 'set', 'incredibly', 'humorous', 'Where', 'Buzz', 'Now', 'are', 'amazing', 'additions', 'are', 'lacking', 'just', '90', 'movie', 'released', 'DVD', 'modern', 'times', 'favorite', 'feature', 'alternate', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'one', 'new', 'dimension', 'movie', 'really', 'feel', 'utter', 'shame', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'editing', 'room', 'floor.Especially', 'new', 'holiday', 'season', 'definitely', 'something', 'add', 'collection', 'great', 'value', 'dollar']",Home Alone VHS

Luckily, this movie is made for everyone!For a basic plot summary, ""Home Alone"" sees young Kevin McCalister (Macaulay Culkin) waking up a few days before Christmas in a completely empty house, his extremely large and rather disorganized family having left him behind on their trip overseas.  While the family tries to get back home, Kevin must outwit a pair of two-bit thieves (played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) who want nothing more than to loot his home.What really makes this film special is the wide appeal of the humor.  One could literally sit down with the entire family (from young to old) and watch this movie, and everyone would be laughing all the way through.  From young Kevin's attempts at ""holding down the fort"", to the bumbling burglars played brilliantly by two veteran actors, this is the type of movie that you will be quoting long after the TV is turned off.Thus, I highly recommend ""Home Alone"" to quite literally anyone, especially during the Christmas season.
