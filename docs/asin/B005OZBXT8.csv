1496966,ABIMJR7WQ0XRF,B005OZBXT8,madbull,"[9, 13]","This is one of the worst plays that I have had the displeasure of viewing.  The whole point of the script was good but the singing drags on forever and the songs are entirely too long causing the viewer to lose interest.  I must admit I fast forwarded through most of the songs because they were too looooooong.  The acting was mediocre and amateurish and I still don't know why Robin ""I can't act my way out of a paper bag"" Givens was even in the play,her role was pointless!  Robin Givens career must really be in the toilet as she has not acted in any movies worth mentioning in quite some time. Stage plays must be her only means of support now because she as well as Vivica Fox have both resorted to doing mostly stage plays.  The only highlight to this movie was Angela Winbush singing her hit song Angel but other than that her role as the mother was unrealistic.  I am glad that I only spent 11.00 to order this movie and I will NOT recommend this one to friends and family. I wish that I had waited to rent it from Blockbuster for 3.00 and I could have saved 8.00.  The producer of this play needs to hone her craft and concentrate on stage plays that are not so long and grueling when it comes to the songs.  People do not want to have to sit through 5 to 7 minutes of singing in one song!",1,Glad it only cost me 11.00,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,1299,"['one', 'worst', 'plays', 'have', 'had', 'displeasure', 'viewing', 'whole', 'point', 'script', 'was', 'good', 'singing', 'drags', 'forever', 'songs', 'are', 'entirely', 'too', 'long', 'causing', 'viewer', 'lose', 'interest', 'must', 'admit', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'most', 'songs', 'were', 'too', 'looooooong', 'acting', 'was', 'mediocre', 'amateurish', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Robin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'way', 'paper', 'bag', 'Givens', 'was', 'even', 'play', 'role', 'was', 'pointless', 'Robin', 'Givens', 'career', 'must', 'really', 'be', 'toilet', 'not', 'acted', 'movies', 'mentioning', 'quite', 'time', 'Stage', 'must', 'be', 'only', 'means', 'support', 'now', 'because', 'as', 'well', 'Vivica', 'Fox', 'have', 'resorted', 'doing', 'mostly', 'stage', 'plays', 'only', 'highlight', 'movie', 'was', 'Angela', 'Winbush', 'singing', 'hit', 'song', 'Angel', 'other', 'role', 'mother', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'am', 'glad', 'only', 'spent', '11.00', 'order', 'movie', 'will', 'NOT', 'recommend', 'one', 'friends', 'family', 'wish', 'had', 'waited', 'rent', 'Blockbuster', '3.00', 'could', 'have', 'saved', '8.00', 'producer', 'play', 'hone', 'craft', 'concentrate', 'stage', 'plays', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'grueling', 'when', 'songs', 'People', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'have', 'sit', '5', '7', 'minutes', 'singing', 'one', 'song']",Church Girl
