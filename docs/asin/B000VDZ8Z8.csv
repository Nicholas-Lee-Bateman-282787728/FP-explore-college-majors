And as the subtitle notes: The story of bravery, loyality and faith.I sat spell bound listening to those who served with him, and hearing how so many men in the service mocked him, demeaned him, and tried to get him to give up his Christian faith, even when they knew he didn't have to serve as a medic because of his religious beliefs but wanted to in order to serve others. And he was nothing short of miraculous and unselfish even when he was badly wounded and was being carried to safety and saw another soldier badly hurt, and Doss rolled off the stretcher and went to help the man and asked that they take him to get further help first.And 400 feet up a cliff area he went, and over twelve hours with the rope set up he devised, he lowered one by one, injured men, at the rate of roughly one every 10-15 minutes. This was while he and his unit were in Urasoe Mura, Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands, April-May 1945. What was so interesting was an Army guy named Cunningham who was in charge of him and ridiculed him and basically called him a coward, ran away when the Japanese were attacking, according to numerous men who served in the same unit and saw the guy run or basically desert.But not once did Doss flinch in any job he was given even when Cunningham and other officers gave him KP duty where his hands were raw from all the cleaning. Or when on Sunday he was made to clean bathrooms.  And he always rested on the sabbath and always had his Bible with him.Some members of his unit even said after he prayed for them, their unit was the only one that didnt loose on man. As the movie shows, those who didnt understand him or disagreed with him at the time, saw a real man once they saw him in action.",5,We need more men/women like Desmond Doss,1211587200,"05 24, 2008",2008,1899,"['one', 'amazing', 'DVD', 'am', 'sure', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'Private', 'First', 'Class', 'Desmond', 'Doss', 'U', 'S', 'Army', 'Medical', 'Detachment', '307th', 'Infantry', 'then', '77th', 'Infantry', 'Division', 'subtitle', 'notes', 'story', 'bravery', 'loyality', 'faith.I', 'sat', 'spell', 'bound', 'listening', 'who', 'served', 'hearing', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'men', 'service', 'mocked', 'demeaned', 'tried', 'get', 'give', 'up', 'Christian', 'faith', 'even', 'when', 'knew', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'serve', 'medic', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'wanted', 'order', 'serve', 'others', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'miraculous', 'unselfish', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'badly', 'wounded', 'was', 'being', 'carried', 'safety', 'saw', 'soldier', 'badly', 'hurt', 'Doss', 'rolled', 'off', 'stretcher', 'went', 'help', 'man', 'asked', 'take', 'get', 'further', 'help', 'first.And', '400', 'feet', 'cliff', 'area', 'went', 'twelve', 'hours', 'rope', 'set', 'up', 'devised', 'lowered', 'one', 'one', 'injured', 'men', 'rate', 'roughly', 'one', '10-15', 'minutes', 'was', 'unit', 'were', 'Urasoe', 'Mura', 'Okinawa', 'Ryukyu', 'Islands', 'April-May', '1945', 'What', 'was', 'so', 'interesting', 'was', 'Army', 'guy', 'named', 'Cunningham', 'who', 'was', 'charge', 'ridiculed', 'basically', 'called', 'coward', 'ran', 'away', 'when', 'Japanese', 'were', 'attacking', 'according', 'numerous', 'men', 'who', 'served', 'same', 'unit', 'saw', 'guy', 'run', 'basically', 'desert.But', 'not', 'once', 'did', 'Doss', 'flinch', 'job', 'was', 'given', 'even', 'when', 'Cunningham', 'other', 'officers', 'gave', 'KP', 'duty', 'where', 'hands', 'were', 'raw', 'cleaning', 'when', 'Sunday', 'was', 'made', 'clean', 'bathrooms', 'always', 'rested', 'sabbath', 'always', 'had', 'Bible', 'him.Some', 'members', 'unit', 'even', 'said', 'prayed', 'unit', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'loose', 'man', 'movie', 'shows', 'who', 'didnt', 'understand', 'disagreed', 'time', 'saw', 'real', 'man', 'saw', 'action']",N/A

I'm neitherChristian nor religious, yet I never felt I was being preached at.  It's simply the case that for this man his faith is what helped give himhis courage and convictions.  Would I want a documentary about Martin Luther King to not deal with how he drew his inspiration from his faith?Or Gandhi or the Dali Llama from theirs?Told by the men who were there, including Doss himself, this is a film that speaks of the grace of refusing to conform, and being drivento do good, even at great personal risk and sacrifice.

Frankly, it is one of the most moving pictures I have ever seen and I highly recommend it.Desmond Doss grew up as a Seventh Day Adventist, his mother being the spiritual leader of the family.  She hung a picture of the 10 commandments in the Doss living room, and young Desmond studied those commandments and took them to heart - literally.  He was particularly affected by the picture depicting the commandment ""You shall not kill"", where Cain stood over a slain Abel, holding a club in his hand.  After being convicted in his heart, he vowed then and there that he would never take a human life.Fastforward 15 years and Desmond Doss enlists in the US Army, intent on becoming a medic.  The Army accepted him, but instead did not accept his request to become a medic.  Instead, they tried to break Doss and turn him into a fighting soldier.  Thus came a series of hard-nosed company commanders who rode young Private Doss hard and persecuted him to give up his religious beliefs and take up a rifle.  The men of his own company rejected and ridiculed him, believing he was weak, a coward, thinking he would get them killed in battle.  They threw Army boots at him as he prayed on bended knees at his cot.  The persecution went on for months, yet Doss stood firm and refused to learn the task of killing.  He was totally isolated and alone, yet, remarkably, this young man did not give up his belief that killing was wrong.  He stood firm.  Finally, the Army relented and Doss entered the medical corp.It was in Okinowa that Doss proved himself.  In the weeklong struggle to take ""Hacksaw Ridge"" from the tenaciously dug-in Japanese, Doss single-handedly saved over 75 men from certain death, many of the men who had ridiculed him for being a coward. Doss evidently had divine protection, for all the men who saw him wade into the Japanese machinegunners to rescue yet another downed American, said what he did was miraculous.  For his bravery in the face of certain death, Doss received the Silver Star, personally awarded by President Harry S. Truman.This DVD documentary depicts the story of Desomnd Doss using stark visual images, the personal accounts of Doss' fellow soldiers, (some of whom Doss saved from certain death), and a return to the site of Hacksaw Ridge (now a children's playground).  Told through the words and tears of his fellow soldiers, the struggle to take Hacksaw Ridge did more than scar the physical body; these men are emotionally scarred by what they have witnessed and done.  Yet, Doss remains sigularly faithful to his beliefs.  He refuses to hate the Japanese, even going so far as to treat the wounds of several Japanese soldiers.  Doss's faith and beliefs learned as a child hold him up during the brutality of all-out war, and he earns the respect and admiration of a nation for his bravery and selfless actions.The world is fortunate to have men of faith like Desmond Doss, for there are so few men like him.  You will be inspired by his story, shocked at the graphic brutality of war, and in the end, you will be blessed having known the story of a true man of courage and faith.The Bible says faith can move mountains.  Desmond Doss moved his mountain on Hacksaw Ridge.  It is a story of a man you will never forget.  Buy it used, buy it new, share it with others, but GET it.  You will be blessed.Jim Koenig",5,Inspiring Story of a True Hero,1226880000,"11 17, 2008",2008,3486,"['inspirational', 'story', 'Army', 'Infantry', 'Corporal', 'Desmond', 'Doss', 'conscientious', 'objector', 'who', 'served', 'Pacific', 'Theatre', 'WWII', 'Frankly', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'pictures', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.Desmond', 'Doss', 'grew', 'up', 'Seventh', 'Day', 'Adventist', 'mother', 'being', 'spiritual', 'leader', 'family', 'hung', 'picture', '10', 'commandments', 'Doss', 'living', 'room', 'young', 'Desmond', 'studied', 'commandments', 'took', 'heart', 'literally', 'was', 'particularly', 'affected', 'picture', 'depicting', 'commandment', 'shall', 'not', 'kill', 'where', 'Cain', 'stood', 'over', 'slain', 'Abel', 'holding', 'club', 'hand', 'being', 'convicted', 'heart', 'vowed', 'then', 'there', 'would', 'never', 'take', 'human', 'life.Fastforward', '15', 'years', 'Desmond', 'Doss', 'US', 'Army', 'intent', 'becoming', 'medic', 'Army', 'accepted', 'instead', 'did', 'not', 'accept', 'request', 'become', 'medic', 'Instead', 'tried', 'break', 'Doss', 'turn', 'fighting', 'soldier', 'Thus', 'came', 'series', 'hard-nosed', 'company', 'commanders', 'who', 'rode', 'young', 'Private', 'Doss', 'hard', 'persecuted', 'give', 'up', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'take', 'up', 'rifle', 'men', 'own', 'company', 'rejected', 'ridiculed', 'believing', 'was', 'weak', 'coward', 'thinking', 'would', 'get', 'killed', 'battle', 'threw', 'Army', 'boots', 'prayed', 'bended', 'knees', 'cot', 'persecution', 'went', 'months', 'yet', 'Doss', 'stood', 'firm', 'refused', 'learn', 'task', 'killing', 'was', 'totally', 'isolated', 'alone', 'yet', 'remarkably', 'young', 'man', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'belief', 'killing', 'was', 'wrong', 'stood', 'firm', 'Finally', 'Army', 'relented', 'Doss', 'entered', 'medical', 'corp.It', 'was', 'Okinowa', 'Doss', 'proved', 'weeklong', 'struggle', 'take', 'Hacksaw', 'Ridge', 'tenaciously', 'dug-in', 'Japanese', 'Doss', 'single-handedly', 'saved', '75', 'men', 'certain', 'death', 'many', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'ridiculed', 'being', 'coward', 'Doss', 'evidently', 'had', 'divine', 'protection', 'men', 'who', 'saw', 'wade', 'Japanese', 'machinegunners', 'rescue', 'yet', 'downed', 'American', 'said', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'miraculous', 'bravery', 'face', 'certain', 'death', 'Doss', 'received', 'Silver', 'Star', 'personally', 'awarded', 'President', 'Harry', 'S.', 'Truman.This', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'story', 'Desomnd', 'Doss', 'using', 'stark', 'visual', 'images', 'personal', 'accounts', 'Doss', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'whom', 'Doss', 'saved', 'certain', 'death', 'return', 'site', 'Hacksaw', 'Ridge', 'now', 'children', 'playground', 'Told', 'words', 'tears', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'struggle', 'take', 'Hacksaw', 'Ridge', 'did', 'more', 'scar', 'physical', 'body', 'men', 'are', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'what', 'have', 'witnessed', 'done', 'Doss', 'sigularly', 'faithful', 'beliefs', 'hate', 'Japanese', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'treat', 'wounds', 'several', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'Doss', 'faith', 'beliefs', 'learned', 'child', 'hold', 'up', 'brutality', 'all-out', 'war', 'respect', 'admiration', 'nation', 'bravery', 'selfless', 'actions.The', 'world', 'fortunate', 'have', 'men', 'faith', 'Desmond', 'Doss', 'are', 'so', 'few', 'men', 'will', 'be', 'inspired', 'story', 'shocked', 'graphic', 'brutality', 'war', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'blessed', 'having', 'known', 'story', 'true', 'man', 'courage', 'faith.The', 'Bible', 'faith', 'can', 'move', 'mountains', 'Desmond', 'Doss', 'moved', 'mountain', 'Hacksaw', 'Ridge', 'story', 'man', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'Buy', 'used', 'buy', 'new', 'share', 'others', 'GET', 'will', 'be', 'blessed.Jim', 'Koenig']",N/A
1101004,A36EW68H08UOCS,B000VDZ8Z8,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[3, 3]","I just finished watching ""The War"" - Ken Burns' documentary about World War II.  I mention this because Mr. Burns is considered the consummate documentary filmmaker - but ""The War"" does not come close to Terry Benedict's ""The Conscientious Objector"" - a film about Desmond Doss, perhaps the bravest American to ever wear a military uniform, even more remarkably, never touching a weapon.I was previously unaware of Mr. Doss, but this film blends first-hand accounts from the members of Company B with archival footage, and the result moved me to tears.Desmond Doss was a Seventh Day Adventist, and did not want to violate the biblical Sabbath, Saturday.  Furthermore, his beliefs would not allow him to touch a weapon, much less harm another human.  But he did not want to use his conscientious objector status to avoid service - he trained as a combat medic and put his faith and skills to use saving the lives of an estimated 100 fellow soldiers.The film begins slowly stateside - as our Hero is ridiculed and ostracized for not carrying a weapon.  Several senior enlisted leaders and officers try to humiliate Doss; if not out of the army, at least out of their company.But the leisurely and safe pace in the U.S. changes as Desmond's unit is sent to the Pacific theatre where they face action from Guam (where a previous tormenting Captain shows himself a coward running away from the battlefield) to Okinawa.  What Doss does on Okinawa I will leave for you to discover, but it is significant that fifty years later, man after man who was with Doss on that island recount his bravery as tears run down their cheeks.They were not alone.An absolutely amazing story of faith and perseverance and bravery beyond anything I've ever heard of, you absolutely must see ""The Conscientious Objector"".

1101008,AP3B615GM191G,B000VDZ8Z8,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[5, 5]","This documentary tells the story of Desmond Doss, an Army medic who entered the army as a conscientious objector and ending up receiving the highest honor bestowed upon a member of the military...the Medal of Honor.  The film really can be split into two parts:The first part tells of Doss's pre-battle experiences, starting with his conviction as a child (after seeing his father almost murder his uncle had not a gun been removed from the situation) to never pick up a firearm or take another life.  However, Doss also felt a great sense to serve his country during World War II, thus enlisted in the military to try and become a medic, enamored with saving lives instead of taking them.  Until seeing battle in Okinawa, though, Doss was ridiculed by fellow soldiers, threatened to be court marshaled, and came close to being kicked out of the Army altogether by his superiors, all for not wanting to pick up a weapon.  The kind of persecution he endured for the simple cause of not training in with a rifle is a great stain upon the entire U.S. military.The second part of the documentary is much more hopeful, as it recounts Doss's harrowing experiences during the U.S. invasion of Okinawa.  While most men were content to protect their own lives, Doss would time and time again risk his breath to save as many soldiers as possible.  In one heroic night, Doss saved nearly an entire fleet of wounded soldiers by patching them up, dragging them to a ridge, and lowing down via a rope by himself...all under heavy Japanese gunfire.  By the time his fighting service ended, Doss was the medic that every Army unit wanted by its side.Finally, the cinematography of this film is incredible.  The most poignant moments include the traveling of Doss (and some of his fellow Army compatriots) to the training fields and battlegrounds of old as they are now.  The emotions are absolutely overpowering at some moments, as the old soldiers ""reminisce"" about the atrocities committed (but the freedom won) on the very ground they are standing on.Desmond Doss is a true American hero, and his story deserves to be told in this wonderful documentary.  Personally, I hold out hope that, through watching this film, more people will come to understand that a man's conviction is not something to be taken lightly, and can be remarkably effective in times when great courage is needed.",5,A Beautiful Look At One Of The Most Couragous Men Alive,1226707200,"11 15, 2008",2008,2372,"['documentary', 'story', 'Desmond', 'Doss', 'Army', 'medic', 'who', 'entered', 'army', 'conscientious', 'objector', 'ending', 'up', 'receiving', 'highest', 'honor', 'bestowed', 'member', 'military', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'film', 'really', 'can', 'be', 'split', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'part', 'tells', 'Doss', 'pre-battle', 'experiences', 'starting', 'conviction', 'child', 'seeing', 'father', 'almost', 'murder', 'uncle', 'had', 'not', 'gun', 'been', 'removed', 'situation', 'never', 'pick', 'up', 'firearm', 'take', 'life', 'However', 'Doss', 'also', 'felt', 'great', 'sense', 'serve', 'country', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'thus', 'enlisted', 'military', 'try', 'become', 'medic', 'enamored', 'saving', 'lives', 'instead', 'taking', 'seeing', 'battle', 'Okinawa', 'though', 'Doss', 'was', 'ridiculed', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'threatened', 'be', 'court', 'marshaled', 'came', 'close', 'being', 'kicked', 'Army', 'altogether', 'superiors', 'not', 'wanting', 'pick', 'up', 'weapon', 'kind', 'persecution', 'endured', 'simple', 'cause', 'not', 'training', 'rifle', 'great', 'stain', 'entire', 'U.S.', 'military.The', 'second', 'part', 'documentary', 'much', 'more', 'hopeful', 'Doss', 'harrowing', 'experiences', 'U.S.', 'invasion', 'Okinawa', 'most', 'men', 'were', 'content', 'protect', 'own', 'lives', 'Doss', 'would', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'risk', 'breath', 'save', 'many', 'soldiers', 'possible', 'one', 'heroic', 'night', 'Doss', 'saved', 'nearly', 'entire', 'fleet', 'wounded', 'soldiers', 'patching', 'up', 'dragging', 'ridge', 'lowing', 'down', 'rope', 'heavy', 'Japanese', 'gunfire', 'time', 'fighting', 'service', 'ended', 'Doss', 'was', 'medic', 'Army', 'unit', 'wanted', 'side.Finally', 'cinematography', 'film', 'incredible', 'most', 'poignant', 'moments', 'include', 'traveling', 'Doss', 'fellow', 'Army', 'compatriots', 'training', 'fields', 'battlegrounds', 'old', 'are', 'now', 'emotions', 'are', 'absolutely', 'overpowering', 'moments', 'old', 'soldiers', 'reminisce', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'freedom', 'won', 'very', 'ground', 'are', 'standing', 'on.Desmond', 'Doss', 'true', 'American', 'hero', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'wonderful', 'documentary', 'Personally', 'hold', 'out', 'hope', 'watching', 'film', 'more', 'people', 'will', 'come', 'understand', 'man', 'conviction', 'not', 'something', 'be', 'taken', 'lightly', 'can', 'be', 'remarkably', 'effective', 'times', 'when', 'great', 'courage', 'needed']",N/A
