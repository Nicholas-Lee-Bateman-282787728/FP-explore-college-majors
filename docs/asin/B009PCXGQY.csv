1601158,A2IEOHFEJYJUZ3,B009PCXGQY,C. B.,"[0, 0]",This was the best film I've seen in a long time.  This group and its members are tremendously inspiring and impressive.  I had no idea the extent or involvement of Anonymous -- an amazing group of incredibly bright young individuals.  You would be missing an important piece of history by not learning something about it.,5,Fantastic!,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,321,"['was', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'group', 'members', 'are', 'tremendously', 'inspiring', 'impressive', 'had', 'idea', 'extent', 'involvement', 'Anonymous', 'amazing', 'group', 'incredibly', 'bright', 'young', 'individuals', 'would', 'be', 'missing', 'important', 'piece', 'history', 'not', 'learning', 'something']",We Are Legion: the Story of the Hacktivists

1601160,A3OPTYVPH2F6LE,B009PCXGQY,Gubio3,"[0, 0]","This is a great documentary on Anonymous. It's very engaging and intriguing. It asks some important questions regarding freedom of information Online and the use of hacking as a form of protest. It highlights the nebulous quality of Anonymous and the wide range of abilities of the hackers involved. The director interviewed Anons (members of Anonymous both past and present); people hacked by Anons; and people studying Anons and hackers in general like Dr. Garbriella Coleman. If you are curious about Anonymous and the role of hacking in creating social change, this is a great place to start.",5,Great Documentary,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,596,"['great', 'documentary', 'Anonymous', 'very', 'engaging', 'intriguing', 'important', 'questions', 'regarding', 'freedom', 'information', 'Online', 'use', 'hacking', 'form', 'protest', 'nebulous', 'quality', 'Anonymous', 'wide', 'range', 'abilities', 'hackers', 'involved', 'director', 'interviewed', 'Anons', 'members', 'Anonymous', 'past', 'present', 'people', 'hacked', 'Anons', 'people', 'studying', 'Anons', 'hackers', 'general', 'Dr.', 'Garbriella', 'Coleman', 'are', 'curious', 'Anonymous', 'role', 'hacking', 'creating', 'social', 'change', 'great', 'place', 'start']",We Are Legion: the Story of the Hacktivists

There was nothing I'd take issue with as far as historical accuracy and the individual members that were interviewed, and their mothers, did a great job explaining the technical aspects.I personally think the HB GARY hacks could merit a documentary in itself.  I personally was horrified by the uncovering of HB GARY's talk of weaponizing sock puppets in Operation Metal Gear.  To me that sort of manipulation of public opinion is very frightening, perhaps as much so as living in a surveillance state, because that's a form of mind control of the masses.  I can't help but think if people understand it, and know about it, they will be more inclined and determined to always think for themselves, so I was disappointed this was not covered in the documentary.  I would also have loved for them to have asked Aaron Burr when he said he big releases of information was destructive, ""Destructive of WHAT?""  What is it he thinks he really supports?Two big issues are brought up that are very important - Yes, a hacktivist doing what is really a victimless crime can do more time than pedophiles, or in some cases, murderers.  The sentences are over the top crazy and heavily weighed towards the very corporations that would often be so oppressive themselves.The end hinted at the NSA's new data center, and where the surveillance state is going.  This was before the time of Ed Snowden.  Because of that, I think it would be great if more people saw this to help them understand a bit more of the issues that are facing our culture, right now, that really need some resolution and light.The film does a great job of steering clear of conspiracy theories that surround the groups, such as government involvement and steering.  I think, in this case, it helps the film a lot.  It sticks to historical facts, but covers the political opinions of members and people that really seem to get it well, and that's really what's important.",5,Asked almost all the important questions,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,2084,"['am', 'very', 'familiar', 'Anonymous', 'have', 'closely', 'followed', 'news', 'events', 'covered', 'video', ""'d"", 'say', 'video', 'did', 'EXCELLENT', 'JOB', 'was', 'nothing', ""'d"", 'take', 'issue', 'as', 'far', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'individual', 'members', 'were', 'interviewed', 'mothers', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'explaining', 'technical', 'aspects.I', 'personally', 'think', 'HB', 'GARY', 'hacks', 'could', 'merit', 'documentary', 'personally', 'was', 'horrified', 'uncovering', 'HB', 'GARY', 'talk', 'weaponizing', 'sock', 'puppets', 'Operation', 'Metal', 'Gear', 'sort', 'manipulation', 'public', 'opinion', 'very', 'frightening', 'perhaps', 'as', 'much', 'living', 'surveillance', 'state', 'form', 'mind', 'control', 'masses', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'people', 'understand', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'inclined', 'determined', 'always', 'think', 'so', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', 'not', 'covered', 'documentary', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'asked', 'Aaron', 'Burr', 'when', 'said', 'big', 'releases', 'information', 'was', 'destructive', 'Destructive', 'WHAT', 'What', 'really', 'Two', 'big', 'issues', 'are', 'brought', 'up', 'are', 'very', 'important', 'Yes', 'hacktivist', 'doing', 'what', 'really', 'victimless', 'crime', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'time', 'pedophiles', 'cases', 'murderers', 'sentences', 'are', 'top', 'crazy', 'heavily', 'weighed', 'very', 'corporations', 'would', 'often', 'be', 'so', 'oppressive', 'themselves.The', 'end', 'hinted', 'NSA', 'new', 'data', 'center', 'where', 'surveillance', 'state', 'going', 'was', 'time', 'Ed', 'Snowden', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'more', 'people', 'saw', 'help', 'understand', 'bit', 'more', 'issues', 'are', 'facing', 'culture', 'right', 'now', 'really', 'need', 'resolution', 'light.The', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'steering', 'clear', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'surround', 'groups', 'such', 'government', 'involvement', 'steering', 'think', 'case', 'film', 'lot', 'historical', 'facts', 'political', 'opinions', 'members', 'people', 'really', 'seem', 'get', 'well', 'really', 'what', 'important']",We Are Legion: the Story of the Hacktivists
