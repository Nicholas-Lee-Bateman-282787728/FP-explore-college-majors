A high energy performance while they were still in their prime.  Since the tour was promoting their just released ""Silent Letter"" album, it contains the only live recordings of several songs from that album including ""Only Game In Town,"" ""Foolin"", and ""All Night"".  Plus it contains many of their classics like ""Horse With No Name"", ""Ventura Highway"", and ""Sister Golden Hair.""

About 8 or so years ago ,I had the priviledge of seeing them at a county sponsored event in town and was amazed how good they still are after playing for so long. They sounded as good as they did back in the early 70's when I first heard them. Some groups play past their &#34;prime&#34;, but that doesn't apply here. It goes to show the vast talent this group has and continues to have. This is a &#34;must have&#34; for any America fan.

The good part of this DVD is that it includes all of America's ""big"" songs up until 1979. The bad part of it is the directing and camera work. The director spent too much time panning the audience, showing people roller skating in Central Park, showing the stage from far off and a number of other distractions while America was playing. If I wanted to see that I'd go to the park myself. Nevertheless, it is worth getting if you like America since it was filmed in 1979 (of historical significance) and they do show America doing many of their hits with close-ups of the band.",3,America - Live at Central Park 1979,1256256000,"10 23, 2009",2009,642,"[""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'America', 'like', 'several', 'songs', 'good', 'part', 'DVD', 'America', 'big', '1979', 'bad', 'part', 'directing', 'camera', 'work', 'director', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'panning', 'audience', 'showing', 'people', 'roller', 'skating', 'Central', 'Park', 'showing', 'stage', 'far', 'number', 'other', 'distractions', 'America', 'was', 'playing', 'wanted', 'see', ""'d"", 'go', 'park', 'Nevertheless', 'getting', 'like', 'America', 'was', 'filmed', '1979', 'historical', 'significance', 'do', 'show', 'America', 'doing', 'many', 'hits', 'close-ups', 'band']",N/A

No matter what I did to my amp in terms of volume and equalization, the sound was small and distant.  Turning it up did not make it any better.  The crowd noises were almost louder than the band and the drums are almost non-existent.

The sound quality is terrible, but that is probably due to the film's age. It was enjoyable, though, to see Gerry and Dewey at the height of their fame and the prime of their career. There are other America DVDs out there that provide a much better listening and viewing experience.
