918421,A3EPH0HLPI98T3,B000A1IL78,Jakey,"[49, 52]","I first viewed this movie in 1997, and fell in love with the film immediately.This film is a rarity in cinema, in regard to the fact that it follows the book (by Cynthia Voight) quite accurately. I've seen so many films, particularily in America, in which the cinematic/television rendition of a novel seems to veer far away from the original story. This film does not, and I credit director Mark Jean for faithfully adapting this wonderful novel to film. Special mention is also due to screenwriter Christopher Carlson for his loyalty to the author's literary art of this story.The four children in this film will steal your heart. Far too many films attempt the use of 'sentimentalism' as a tactic for capturing the viewer. This film, on the contrary, wins us over through its stark reality in what might happen under such dire circumstances as juvenile-sibling homelessness. We, the viewers, begin to discover ourselves feeling enveloped by the trials & difficulties these children face. The four kids are indeed good actors. Nevertheless, it is their fortitude that we come to admire, (particularily that of 'Dicey', played in a stealth peformance by Kimberlee Peterson).Moreover, words cannot accurately describe the sheer, stunning performance, (during the latter half of this film), brought forth by Academy Award winner Anne Bancroft. Assuredly, there is not an actress living today who can boast of a talent greater than the awe-inspiring Ms. Bancroft. What separates an 'everyday' actor from the 'great' ones? Simply stated, it is when we view a film and we find ourselves BELIEVING the character we see before us on the screen. For the better part of an hour, I had totally forgotten that the lovely Anne Bancroft had been cast for this film. Instead, I saw Abigail..... a reclusive and mean-stricken (on the surface) old lady, who has such an overwhelming burden of hurt deep within her, one tends to think she is beyond despair. Yet the willed-determination of a child, of grandchildren who desire nothing more than the tiniest sliver of acceptance...... can even the most crotchety of human beings turn away those who need him/her above all else?In this film, the outcome is not predictable as one might assume.

918423,AX7C5SVVLCB5N,B000A1IL78,Michael Eldicott,"[13, 13]","Abandoned by their mother, 3 small children have to rely on the fortitude and strength of their older sister (herself but a child). Determined to keep the family together, she avoids the authorities and, virtually penniless, leads her charges on a long walk in search of an aunt they've never seen. The aunt has died, so they continue in quest of a grandmother, who, left bitter and reclusive by a repressive marriage and loss of her children, gives them a less than warm welcome. The children need someone who can provide security, the grandmother needs someone who can provide love and companionship, but can fulfilment of this mutual need stand against her intransigence? Resolution comes in an underplayed scene without dialogue which is more telling than any I've seen in a movie in a long time. The film can't be faulted: story, script, direction, casting and acting are topnotch, with great performances by the child actors and Anne Bancroft (what a natural actress she was).
