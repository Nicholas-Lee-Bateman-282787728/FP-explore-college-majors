As I get older, perhaps I get more critical, so I will say this - the acting in the beginning of the movie (the necessary &#34;set-up&#34;) is not very good. The actors are much more comfortable in their roles as the movie progresses.

381228,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,6303599109,Alex Udvary,"[2, 4]","""Doctor Zhivago"" is one of David Lean's most popular films. It is a masterpice, and not only one of his best works, but, one of the greatest of all-time. But there's something about that statement that makes ""Doctor Zhivago"" an oddity. Ask someone if they've heard of it, and chances are they will say yes. Now ask someone if they like it, and you'll find a mixed reaction. Many people refer to this as one of David Lean's ""lesser"" efforts. And that's a shame. To watch it, is to watch one of the greatest epic romances ever on par with ""Gone With The Wind"" (which I think is the greatest).""Doctor Zhivago"" tells the story of a country, Russia, in the middle of the revolution and of a famous poet\doctor Yuri Zhivago's search for the woman he loves. Yuri Zhivago played Omar Sharif is married to Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) but is really in love with Lara (Julie Christie) and finds himself constantly thinking of her.The film is told in flashback fashion, and there was something about this I didn't like because it reduces Sir. Alec Guinness' part to merely that of ""the storyteller"". He serves no other funtion than to tell us what happen. I think Guiness was a brilliant actor. One of the best character actors we had. He here there's nothing for him. Lean had given him a great parts in previous films such as ""Bridge On The River Kwai"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"".There's a movie out now called ""Cold Mountain"" which is an attempt to bring back movies like this, but ""Cold Mountain"" lacks a certan heart that ""Doctor Zhivago"" has. Even after more than 30 years we are still pulled in by the story. That is a mark of a classic film.""Doctor Zhivago"" when released was nominated for ten Oscars including ""best picture"" and ""best director"". It walked away with five ""best cinematography"", ""best screenplay"" and ""best score"" to name a few.Also of note, look out for German actor Klaus Kinski's brief role.Bottom-line: Not only one of David Lean's best but one of the greatest romantic epics of all-time.

381233,AR15V2ULA2EYM,6303599109,Antonio Giusto,"[2, 3]","Doctor Zhivago is a film I really had to question even though it has stood the test of time and is undeniably a classic.The cinematography is breathtaking and is accompanied by brilliant musical scores. I see it as one of the most stylish films of the 20th century. My problem with this film is the story. Not really the whole story but rather the main character Doctor Zhivago. I found myself detesting him for his lack of self-control and unfaithfulness to his more than faithful wife. It made me ask myself if this is actually a love story set during a countries revolution or the story of a hypocrite set during a counties revolution? I say hypocrite because Zhivago detests the lack of morals in a revolting society surrounding him yet he is a man obviously lacking in morals himself. Are the things that happen to him sort of a just punishment for his hypocrisy? To be honest with you, no I see it more as punishment for the people he has betrayed and the people he indulges his urges with. His absence affects others more than himself. They depend on him.That's just the way I see it. Now with all that said does that said do I hate this movie because of that? No, I think I should be praising it instead. Just because I don't like a characters choices in a film doesn't mean I should hate the film. This film would have never been as effective if Zhivago didn't cheat on his wife. Any character that stirs up a viewer's emotions whether it's love or hate is a job well done. If a viewer has strong emotions for a character it is the mark of a great film. Mixed viewer emotions for a character is brilliance. It is the sign of true portrayal of a human being.  There are things to love and hate about all of us.

381234,A62G4QX6XQVLP,6303599109,Anyechka,"[1, 2]","I only saw this recently, having always wanted to read the book before seeing the movie so I would know the complete story first and know what was missing from the movie.  This movie is gorgeous, particularly the snow-encrusted house where Yuriy, Lara, and Lara's daughter Katya stay after Yuriy and Lara finally get together properly.  And though I love Pasternak, reading his novel made it obvious he was first and foremost a talented poet, not a writer of prose.  I didn't find it boring like so many others have, but it still had its slow and boring moments, and way too much background information on truly minor characters.  The movie got rid of all of that; however, it also cut out things that were important in the novel, things which might have made the movie even more enjoyable if included.At the beginning, we see young Yuriy at his mother's funeral, and then instantly we're seeing him, Tonya, Lara, and Pasha as young adults (I'd assume early twenties).  Their childhoods in the novel lay the foundation for their character development, like understanding that Yuriy and his friends come from wealth and privilege, and Lara and her friends are poor and more susceptible to the new revolutionary ideas.  And where is Yuriy's friend Misha Gordon, who in boyhood lived with him, or their other friends Nika Dudorov and Yusupka Galiullin, or Lara's little brother Rodyon, or any of Lara's other friends?  Also missing from the section on their early years is how Lara goes to work as a nanny for the Kologrivov family to escape from Komarovskiy.  And where is the birth of Yuriy and Tonya's son?In the movie, the love story is more believable and credible than in the book, but not significantly more so.  Minus all of the background information on their characters or any sort of detailed exploration of the various events that keep throwing the two of them together, each time for longer intervals and with deepening feelings, there's still no plausible basis for why they should get together.  At least in the movie Yuriy spends more time in bed with Lara than writing poetry after she's fallen asleep.Like the book, the movie too should have ended with Yuriy's final meeting with Strelnikov after Lara and Katya have gone away with Komarovskiy, but surprisingly that important event isn't even in the movie.  Granted at least the movie cuts out the for the most part superfluous Epilogue and Conclusion in the book (who wants to know that Yuriy shacks up with his childhood friend Marina when he gets back home and has two daughters with her?), but the end that does come about is at least significantly better and more conclusive than the dead-end offered in the novel.  Though why doesn't Tanya tell Yevgraf about the insane woman she was living with in Siberia like in the novel?  And we still don't find out what happens to Lara's daughter Katya.

381236,A2UKL0E9AG6FG9,6303599109,Auntie Analogue,"[6, 6]","In our so-called &quot;postmodern&quot; period, with its pestilence of political correctness, David Lean's Doctor Zhivago remains resoundingly resonant. As Yuri Zhivago learns from a Red partisan commissar, &quot;All men will be judged&quot; on their political reliability. Interrogated by the cunning, ruthlessly politically correct Peoples' Commander Strelnikoff, &quot;What will you do...?&quot;, Yuri Zhivago answers, &quot;Just live.&quot;A superb cast's unforgettable performances, John Box's evocative production design, Robert Bolt's letter-perfect screenplay, David Lean's gripping macro and microscopic contrasts of the personal and the political, Phyllis Dalton's meticulous costuming, and Maurice Jarre's haunting score powerfully combine to touch us in our tenderest parts, and to leave us as thoughtful, and as hopeful, in 2002 as audiences were at film's 1965 debut.The film's sole want was for 70mm Panavision, but producer Carlo Ponti either could not, or would not, afford Lean that capacity. Despite this precondition Lean crafted, in the face of contemporary reviews that were either lukewarm or condescending, that most curious, engaging creature of film immortality: an enduring cinematic triumph that audiences loved then and go on loving now.Though other movies, in purely technical terms of film medium, can be judged superior, Doctor Zhivago remains my favorite because, through brilliant interplay of the film's vast scope and intensive personal focus, it captures perfectly our human experience. Doctor Zhivago distills the classical three-horned dilemma: parade in groupthink lockstep with fashionable ideologues, opportunistically go along to get along, or march to the beat of the different drummer.As much as I wish to see myself as the passionate, loving Lara, or as much as men might wish to see themselves as the insightful, honorable Yuri, the wholeness of Doctor Zhivago's embrace embarrasses each of us into acknowledging the less than redeeming traits each of us must, in truth, admit. For that solitary, compelling reason Doctor Zhivago binds us, and those who come after us, in its thrall.",5,Doctor Zhivago and Postmodern Political Correctness,1011312000,"01 18, 2002",2002,2130,"['so-called', 'quot', 'postmodern', 'quot', 'period', 'pestilence', 'political', 'correctness', 'David', 'Lean', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'resoundingly', 'resonant', 'Yuri', 'Zhivago', 'Red', 'partisan', 'commissar', 'quot', 'men', 'will', 'be', 'judged', 'quot', 'political', 'reliability', 'Interrogated', 'cunning', 'ruthlessly', 'politically', 'correct', 'Peoples', 'Commander', 'Strelnikoff', 'quot', 'What', 'will', 'do', 'quot', 'Yuri', 'Zhivago', 'answers', 'quot', 'Just', 'live.', 'quot', 'A', 'superb', 'cast', 'unforgettable', 'performances', 'John', 'Box', 'evocative', 'production', 'design', 'Robert', 'Bolt', 'letter-perfect', 'screenplay', 'David', 'Lean', 'gripping', 'macro', 'microscopic', 'contrasts', 'personal', 'political', 'Phyllis', 'Dalton', 'meticulous', 'costuming', 'Maurice', 'Jarre', 'haunting', 'score', 'powerfully', 'combine', 'touch', 'tenderest', 'parts', 'leave', 'thoughtful', 'hopeful', '2002', 'audiences', 'were', 'film', '1965', 'debut.The', 'film', 'sole', 'want', 'was', '70mm', 'Panavision', 'producer', 'Carlo', 'Ponti', 'either', 'could', 'not', 'would', 'not', 'afford', 'Lean', 'capacity', 'precondition', 'Lean', 'crafted', 'face', 'contemporary', 'reviews', 'were', 'lukewarm', 'condescending', 'most', 'curious', 'engaging', 'creature', 'film', 'immortality', 'enduring', 'cinematic', 'triumph', 'loved', 'then', 'go', 'loving', 'other', 'movies', 'purely', 'technical', 'terms', 'film', 'medium', 'can', 'be', 'judged', 'superior', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'favorite', 'brilliant', 'interplay', 'film', 'vast', 'scope', 'intensive', 'personal', 'focus', 'perfectly', 'human', 'experience', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'classical', 'three-horned', 'dilemma', 'parade', 'groupthink', 'lockstep', 'fashionable', 'ideologues', 'opportunistically', 'go', 'along', 'get', 'along', 'march', 'beat', 'different', 'drummer.As', 'much', 'wish', 'see', 'passionate', 'loving', 'Lara', 'as', 'much', 'men', 'might', 'wish', 'see', 'insightful', 'honorable', 'Yuri', 'wholeness', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'embrace', 'acknowledging', 'less', 'redeeming', 'traits', 'must', 'truth', 'admit', 'solitary', 'compelling', 'reason', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'who', 'come', 'thrall']",Doctor Zhivago VHS
381237,A355VZC33RZGNA,6303599109,A Viewer and Reader,"[3, 4]","Somewhere my love, there will be songs to singAlthough the snow covers the hope of springSomewhere a hill blossoms in green and goldAnd there are dreams, all that your heart can holdSomeday well meet again, my loveSomeday whenever the spring breaks throughYou'll come to me out of the long-agoWarm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snowTill then, my sweet, think of me now and thenGodspeed, my love, till you are mine againTo this reader/viewer Maurice Jarre hit the perfect note when he composed ""Lara's Theme"" for David Lean's version of Pasternak's ""Doctor Zhivago.""  While Jurii Zhivago is the main character Lara is in fact the central figure of the drama.  Her rape-seduction by wealthy powerful Komarovsky, himself a metaphor for exploitative Imperial Russia, is the `inciting incident' for the story and metaphorically for the chaos transforming Russia.  This incident is the `hook' for the main-character-action in Pasternak's novel, Lean's film version, and the Masterpiece Theatre version and everything that follows springs from this event.In the novel Pasternak gives us this picture of Lara. She was: ""...only a little over sixteen but she was well developed. People thought she was eighteen or more. She had a good mind and was easy to get along with. She was very good looking....Lara was the purest being in the world.""  Her mother tells Komarovsky to take Lara to the party as she is not feeling well: ""Take Lara. You are always telling me to look after Lara. Well now you look after her....And look after her he did--what a joke!....It was all this waltzing that had started it....But never again would she allow anyone to kiss her like that....She must stop all this nonsense."" They leave the party and Komarosky chides her: ""Good heavens, Lara, what an idea! I just wanted to show you my apartment. We're so near.""  Afterwards, ""Lara walked all the way in a daze and realized what had happened to her only when she reached home....If mother learned about it she would kill her...and then she would kill herself...Now she was--what was is called?--a fallen woman....Her shoulders quivered. She was weeping.""The Masterpiece Theatre version gives us a rather different view of this incident as Lara is deliberately set up by her mother for Komarovsky's lust, and Lara is willing to go along with it, well aware that her mother is his mistress and he is their benefactor.  Her mother says: ""Lara you have to go! And please be nice to him. For my sake.""  They dance, he kisses her, she doesn't resist and she says ""All right I'll do it!...That's what it has all been  about isn't it? So all right. What do you do? Ask for a room? I'm sure you've done this before?"" He says, ""Larissa this was never in my mind."" She says, ""Yes it was. Don't lie about it. I don't want any lies between you and me. I'm tired of being a child."" ""Very well,"" he answers taking her into the billiard room and undoing her dress.  Afterwards at home she studies her reflection in the mirror and smiles, clearly savoring the memory of Komarovsky's passion for her, and her own pleasure in what had happened.Subsequently Pasternak reveals Lara's afterthoughts: ""What an inescapable spell it was! If Komarovsky's intrusion into her life had merely filled her with disgust, she would have rebelled and broken free. But it was not so simple as that."" She: ""...was flattered that a handsome man whose hair was turning gray, a man old enough to be her father, a man who was applauded at meetings and written up in newspapers, should spend his time and money on her, should take her out to concerts and plays, and tell her that he worshipped her, and should, as they say, `improve her mind'....Komarovsky's lovemaking in a carriage behind the coachman's back or in an opera box in full view of the audience fascinated her by its daring and aroused the little devil slumbering in her to imitate him....It is she who has a hold on him. Doesn't she see how much he needs her?  She has nothing to be afraid of. Her conscience is clear.  It is he who should be ashamed, and terrified of her giving him away. But that is just what she will never do...she does not have the necessary ruthlessness--Komarovsky's chief asset in dealing with subordinates and weaklings....And he continued taking her, veiled,  to dinner in the private rooms of that ghastly restaurant where the waiters and clients undressed her with their eyes as she came in. And she merely wondered: `Does one always humiliate those one loves?' ""It is at this time that Lara notices the effect she has upon Pasha Antipov, a boy of her age who eventually becomes Strelnikov. In Pasternak's words, ""He was so childishly simple he did not conceal his joy at seeing her...As soon as she realized the kind of influence she had on him, she began unconsciously to make use of it....several years later and at a much further stage in their relationship she took his malleable, easygoing character seriously in hand. By then Pasha knew that he was head over heals in love with her and that it was for life."" But the revelation of her affair with Komarovsky turns Pasha into the empty cold-hearted Strelnikov.The effect of her affair with Komarovsky on her mother, his mistress, is the woman's attempt at suicide. The aftermath of her recovery is witnessed by an orphaned youth of Lara's age, Yurii Zhivago, a by-chance observer of the scene between Lara and Komarovsky described thus by Pasternak: ""Not a word passed their lips, only their eyes met. But the understanding between them had a terrifying quality of magic, as is if he were the master of a puppet show and she were a puppet obedient to his every gesture....in answer to his sneering glance she gave him a sly wink of complicity. Both of them were pleased that it had all ended so well---their secret was safe and Madame Guishar's attempted suicide had failed. Yurii devoured them with his eyes....""In both David Lean's and Masterpiece Theatre's versions of Doctor Zhivago he is a young man, a medical student helping with the mother's recovery, and he is captivated by Lara.  But the current love interest in his life is Tonia, the daughter of his foster parents.  So now we have a love quadrangle: Lara, Komarovsky, Pasha/Strelnikov, and Yurii Zhivago; and a love triangle Lara, Yurii, and Tonia.  Lara is always at the center of the action either actually or by implication, and it is with this central theme that Pasternak uses his novel as a vehicle for his artistic, philosophical, religious, and political beliefs offered with endless details of the times and a huge cast of secondary characters.After six months of the affair with Komarovsky a disillusioned Lara develops the `necessary ruthlessness' to give him away. She arrives at the Sventitskys' Christmas party with a pistol and the story unfolds from there. After pouring over the novel, viewing Lean's magnificent film many times, and thoroughly absorbing the Masterpiece Theatre version, I find myself utterly enchanted with all three productions each offering uniquely delightful variations and dimensions for this marvelous tale.Those ""film critics"" who panned Lean's Doctor Zhivago as a mere soap-opera seem oblivious of the fact that Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize For Literature for creating it, and have missed the point that the abused and much-loved Lara is herself Mother Russia.",5,Lara's Theme,1228780800,"12 9,

The lovers are thrown together by circumstance.  Sound trite & overdone?  Not this version.The book is riveting and I was doubtful that the poetry of the book would reach the film.  It does.  The cinematography is stunning.  Each scene is like a wonderful painting that only enhances the drama of the lives of these people caught up in the turmoil of the time.Yuri,a doctor who also writes beautful poetry, marries his childhood  sweetheart, daughter of an upper-class family.  Lara is the daughter of a mere seamstress who marries her lover, an impoverished student, Sasha.  She has had an affair with an older man in Moscow but Sasha forgives her and they move away from Moscow.When WWI hits, all men are conscripted but the Czar's Army is a brutal place to be.  Pre-war revolutionary feelings ripen into full-blown rebellion.Yuri has been inducted into the army due to his medical experience.  He meets Lara in a field hospital.  She is a volunteer nurse, searching for her missing husband.Having found each other, and not knowing where their respective spouses are, they fall in love but they are loyal to ther marriage vows.  Unfortunately the time comes when they part only to be swept up into the chaos of the Revolution.Yuri's family is now in the country for safety and ironically their dacha is near a town where Lara has settled.  Yuri enters the town one day and they meet again.  This second meeting is more than they can resist and they begin their love affair but Yuri is kidnapped by the Red Army to supply medical aid.

381243,ALR35EFI69S5R,6303599109,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[29, 32]","What a wonderful surprise to discover this film as finally been released in the DVD format. Indeed, absolutely no one was a more masterful film maker than David Lean, the British director of such classics as &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, &quot;Bridge Over the River Kwai&quot;, &quot;Ryan's Daughter&quot; and, of course, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (see my reviews of all these films). Lean's cinematography is always spectacular and breathtaking, for he had a special appreciation for how the nature of one's natural surroundings set the stage and influenced the dramatic proceedings. Thus, Lean characteristically focused his films on the ways in which individuals and their personal characteristics clash and meld with the larger social, cultural, and historical surround in which they are located, and so each film is a uniquely captivating study of the specific dynamics of each particular individual situation. Each of these films is also a well-choreographed and photographed excursion into the topography, climate, and landscape of the geographic location in which the drama unfolds. The eyes and ears are always delighted by what Lean displays.Here the beauty and innocence of nature is constantly contrasted with the ugliness, artificiality, and depravity of man's environs both under the Czar as well as under the brutally repressive communist regime. Omar Sharif turns on a wonderful performance as young Yuri Zhivago, by turns an orphan, poet, and medical doctor sponsored by the family he will soon marry into. The character of Zhivago is that of an unrepentant innocent, a true Russian peasant transported by situation and circumstance away from his rural origins into the bustling aristocracy of Moscow before the October revolution. All Zhivago wants is to immerse himself wholehearted in the life he has made for himself and his family, yet again and again he is forced by circumstance to serve for forces beyond his doorstep. Unfortunately for Yuri, he is caught in a time and place in which such personal extravagance and private self-absorption is no longer tolerated. Indeed, in the violent and tumultuous Russia of the first half of the 20th century, such a private life was impossible.When war comes, he is pressed into service as a field doctor. Later, after returning to the streets of Moscow, which is in turmoil and difficulty associated with the social changes forced by the Bolsheviks, he decides to escape the political madness by fleeing with the family to the country estate in the Urals. Once there, however, Yuri is forced once more into medical service by the Reds in their running civil ware against the Whites raging throughout Russia. In all this, he collides fatefully with the beautiful Lara, who is played by the very young and beautiful Julie Christie. In their love affair Zhivago finds the emotional inspiration and solace he has sought through all this but has denied himself for the sake of his wife and family. Against this backdrop of the personal odyssey of Zhivago, the events of the Russian revolution and its aftermath are brilliantly depicted. As in all of the Lean movies, the ways in which each character's nature, individual characteristics, and personal foibles project themselves into the larger social circumstances provides the focus of the unfolding story.The cinematography here is absolutely breath-taking, and the many spectacular action sequences and memorable musical score by Maurice Jarre (for which he received an Oscar) all contribute to make this one of the most popular and memorable films of all time. The cast is wonderful, with terrific performances by Sharif, Christie, Geraldine Chaplin, Rod Steiger, Tom Courteney, Rita Tushingham (as Zhivago's bastard daughter with Lara), and a number of notable others, including a small part by Sir Alec Guinness as Zhivago's half-brother Yevgrav, who acts as the narrator of the film. By the way, the film has aged very well, and as a piece of history and as a piece of popular entertainment it is easily one of the top ten of all time.

Yes, but it brings us into the very heart of events that turned the wheel of history: the rise and the blind force of the masses in the form of Communism, which was rather inhumane and devastating.Communism was at first most ruthlessly suppressed by the authority, just in the way the Minster of Justice relentlessly taking advantage of the school girl, Lara. And then Communism grew fast taking hold of even the students including the boyfriend of Lara who later became a most furious Red Army General.It isn't great cinematography that it is all about. Beautiful settings, yes, with literally thousands soldiers fighting in the snowy battlefields plus poetic scenes of calm and serene countryside in Russia etc. There are also round and forceful characters representing various aspects of human nature interweaving these epic changes giving the story a lot of drama and substances.We have Lara's ex-boyfriend, the Red Army General who gave up virtually everything to fight for and who eventually died for his ideology; the pleasure seeking Minister of Justice or the ""flesh"", whose only concern was to save his own skin; Dr Zhivago was a poet with a soul who suffered most; and the doctor's half brother, the opportunistic secret policeman, or the real winner, who fished in the troubled water, riding the great tides and became a respected and powerful General in the new regime; and Lara the weak, she managed to survive but was deprived virtually of everything, love and daughter and the latter landed in an orphange without knowing her own history, bestowed with a deep sense of mistrust...And the whole story was wrought up beautifully by great cinematography for one thing, and Dr Zhivago's poetry for another, and above all, by Lara's Theme played by a balailika which their daughter learned to play by instinct: it sounds so sad and irking. This is just too pricy a lesson.I haven't read the original novel by Pasternak who had won the Nobel Prize.

381251,A141HP4LYPWMSR,6303599109,Brian E. Erland,"[5, 6]","I first saw 'Doctor Zhivago' at the theater in '65 and was immediately captivated by Maurice Jarre's marvelous soundtrack and the grandiose cinematography featuring the harsh but breathtakingly magnificent Russian landscape. For many years it ranked high on my all-time favorite movie list and I always looked forward to seeing it whenever it made a rare television appearance. However it had been a number of years since my last viewing and was anxious to purchase the DVD.Finally viewing this long time classic again I have to be honest and admit that in my opinion it hasn't weathered the test of time quite as well as I had expected it would. The music is as enchanting as ever and the cinematograpy is certainly wonderful, especially during the winter sequences, but I now find it somewhat ponderous and slow in many spots. The romantic affair with Lara (Julie Christie) appears overly melodramatic and Yuri's (Omar Sharif) naive, sentimental persona just doesn't work for me anymore. Waiting for him to make-up his mind and do the right thing became frustrating after awhile. Ultimately I found his characterization of a profound and deeply emotional poet silently wandering through the flower garden in search of a verse to be tedious and quite boring.On the positive side, Julie Christie is marvelous as Lara, as is Rod Steiger (Victor Komarovsky) and Geraldine Chaplin as Tonya. My personal favorites are Alec Guinness as Yuri's half-brother Yevgraf and Tom Courtenay as the intense revolutionary, Pasha.Don't get me wrong, it's still a classic, just not as classic as I once thought.

381252,APP5MBH2BSX6I,6303599109,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[1, 2]","When this film came out I was 6 years old.  It's always been one of my mother's faves.  Is it any surprise it took me until now to get around to watching it for myself?This classic motion picture epic tells the story of the Communist revolution that followed WWI, and in particular the story of an idealistic, apolitical young physician/poet and the two women who are at the center of his attention at different times in his life.  It strikes me as a type of ""Gone With the Russian Wind,"" although the good doctor and his ladies are as far from the passions of Rhett & Scarlett as is the heat of Atlanta from the icy cold of Moscow and the Ural Mountains.  In the middle of civil war, however, both films zoom in on the way the events of tumultuous times wreak havoc in the lives of even those not directly involved, and great drama is found in each of these dissimilar settings.If you're not familiar with the plot, there are other reviews here that can fill you in; I'll not belabor the point.  Suffice it to say that I should have taken the time to watch this film long before I did, if only because it has helped me understand the evolution of the Soviet Union (and the inherent weaknesses that doomed it from the start) more than before.  It's considered by the NY Times to be one of the 1000 best films of all time, and probably any movie buff would agree.It has its shortcomings, however.  The film too often lingers for wa-y-y-y too much time in periods where characters are simply sitting or lying around doing nothing.  Not sure what director David Lean was trying to do with the pace of the story in these extended moments (particularly when the doctor and Lara are in the big house in the middle of nowhere), but this could stand some editing, at least to the eyes of a filmgoer of this later generation.  Also, with Sir Alec Guinness as the film's narrator, Mr. Lean adopted a most unusual and jarring device of using Guinness as narrator even of scenes where he appears as what would normally be a speaking character, giving us discomfiting moments wherein a character speaks to Guinness's character and he merely stares at them while his own voice says, in voiceover, what he said to the character who had just spoken to him.  (Yes, it's just as confusing as it sounds.)Finally, I know ""Lara's Theme (Somewhere My Love)"" is a beloved movie tune, but by the time the film was halfway over I was sick to death of it.  That's not quite as boring, however, as the five-minute opening ""Overture,"" featuring bits and pieces of the various music themes played throughout the film; the whole movie begins with a colorful impressionstic painting, one still graphic, shown behind the music, with the word ""Overture"" superimposed.  After about two minutes of that I wondered if the opening credits would ever roll.""Dr. Zhivago"" is a style of movie from days gone by, to be sure.

381256,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,6303599109,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","This sweeping epic of a film, Dr. Zhivago, does an excellent job of integrating a romantic love story within the world changing Russian Revolution. The film covers the intellectual growing criticism of the Romanov family, the rise of the Bolsheviks in the working poor, the effect of World War I on the Russian people which prepares them to overthrown the Czar and create a worker's government. Like Tolstoy's great War and Peace and Naipaul's The Bend in the River, the film shows how the lives of ordinary families and persons are swept up in the forces of war, politics, and history. This is a central theme in Dr. Zhivago where a young man and his family are separated due to these societal forces. There is a pivotal excellent scene in the film, where Zhivago has come from visiting his mistress Laura and is returning to his pregnant wife when paralyzed between his loving wife and son and his duty to family and his deep passion for his mistress Laura, Zhivago's horse slows to a crawl. At this point, a scouting party from the Red Army surrounds him and conscripts him for his medical services during a military campaign. Unable to make the decision between wife and mistress, the forces of history make the decision for him.The character of Zhivago, played very well by Omar Sharif, is that of a sensitive intellectual, artist, romantic, who was born in a world of privilege and is now cast into a world changing world of revolution. Yet, in the end, I found it hard to come to terms with his final sacrifices and decisions, especially the decision to allow Lara to escape to Mongolia with her daughter and unborn child in the company of a vicious man that Zhivago knows to be self serving and cruel. While his wife, son, and daughter escape to Paris and his mistress and unborn child escape to Mongolia, Zhivago decides to stay in Russia. Is it due to his love of medicine? Is it due to his love of poetry? Is it due to his love of Russia? It must be the love of Russia that compels him to leave Laura and remain. But at this point the story becomes ideology and seems to test our sense of reality. For if this idealistic poet of the upper classes remains in Russia, the implication is that Russia is not lost, that a new Russia can be built, and that the new Russia can be built by the intellectual poet from the former upper class as well as the mass forces of the unsophisticated working class. If Pasternak had allowed Zhivago to immigrate to Paris with his wife and son and daughter, the message would be that the intellectual and artist and former ruling classes have no role in the new Russia. If Pasternak had allowed Zhivago to escape to Mongolia with Laura, the message would be much the same with the exception that he makes the choice based on passion. Thus this romantic dreamer makes a very hard objective decision to live in isolation from the two women he loves and that love him for an abstract love of the motherland. It makes a good novel and a good film, but lacks the credibility of lived experience - for if anyone knows that the forces of a single man against the forces of brutal history is often defeat, it is Zhivago.Zhivago is an interesting character for we are shown in this film that Zhivago undergoes one loss after another and in each case he recovers, adjusts, and continues to remain in contact with the mystical beautiful forces of the natural world. The joy that Zhivago experiences watching sun rise and sun set and wind and snow and ice are contrasted against the forces of man that take so much from this young man.If there is one criticism of the film, it is that often the Bolsheviks are shown as opportunistic, manipulative, power hungry, intolerant, ideologues. There is a tendency to portray the aristocrats in both the French and Russian revolution to be genteel saints and the revolutionary forces to be power-drive murderers. Balance is needed when the work of art does not portray both sides fairly. Suppose the films about the American revolution showed the British as highly civilized, intelligent victims of a bunch of wildly out of control violent New English colonists. We would hardly think this view as accurate. Yet both French and Russian revolutionists are often portrayed in films as homicidal opportunists and criminals.The films of David Lean are sweeping in their visual approach to storytelling and this film is a masterpiece of capturing the Russian motherland in the grasp of a civil war. I recommend the film highly for the romance, the history, the artistic telling of a great tale; but be aware of how subtle clues in the film reveal Pasternak's one-sided political philosophy.",4,Historical romance of great depth,1260576000,"12 12, 2009",2009,4655,"['sweeping', 'epic', 'film', 'Dr.', 'Zhivago', 'excellent', 'job', 'integrating', 'romantic', 'love', 'story', 'world', 'changing', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'film', 'intellectual', 'growing', 'criticism', 'Romanov', 'family', 'rise', 'Bolsheviks', 'working', 'poor', 'effect', 'World', 'War', 'Russian', 'people', 'overthrown', 'Czar', 'create', 'worker', 'government', 'Tolstoy', 'great', 'War', 'Peace', 'Naipaul', 'Bend', 'River', 'film', 'how', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'families', 'persons', 'are', 'swept', 'up', 'forces', 'war', 'politics', 'history', 'central', 'theme', 'Dr.', 'Zhivago', 'where', 'young', 'man', 'family', 'are', 'separated', 'due', 'societal', 'forces', 'pivotal', 'excellent', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'Zhivago', 'come', 'visiting', 'mistress', 'Laura', 'returning', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'when', 'paralyzed', 'loving', 'wife', 'son', 'duty', 'family', 'deep', 'passion', 'mistress', 'Laura', 'Zhivago', 'horse', 'crawl', 'point', 'scouting', 'party', 'Red', 'Army', 'conscripts', 'medical', 'services', 'military', 'campaign', 'Unable', 'make', 'decision', 'wife', 'mistress', 'forces', 'history', 'make', 'decision', 'him.The', 'character', 'Zhivago', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'sensitive', 'intellectual', 'artist', 'romantic', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'world', 'privilege', 'now', 'cast', 'world', 'changing', 'world', 'revolution', 'end', 'found', 'hard', 'come', 'terms', 'final', 'sacrifices', 'decisions', 'especially', 'decision', 'allow', 'Lara', 'escape', 'Mongolia', 'daughter', 'unborn', 'child', 'company', 'vicious', 'man', 'be', 'self', 'serving', 'cruel', 'wife', 'son', 'daughter', 'escape', 'Paris', 'mistress', 'unborn', 'child', 'escape', 'Mongolia', 'Zhivago', 'stay', 'Russia', 'due', 'love', 'medicine', 'due', 'love', 'poetry', 'due', 'love', 'Russia', 'must', 'be', 'love', 'Russia', 'leave', 'Laura', 'remain', 'point', 'story', 'ideology', 'test', 'sense', 'reality', 'idealistic', 'poet', 'upper', 'classes', 'Russia', 'implication', 'Russia', 'not', 'lost', 'new', 'Russia', 'can', 'be', 'built', 'new', 'Russia', 'can', 'be', 'built', 'intellectual', 'poet', 'former', 'upper', 'class', 'as', 'well', 'mass', 'forces', 'unsophisticated', 'working', 'class', 'Pasternak', 'had', 'allowed', 'Zhivago', 'immigrate', 'Paris', 'wife', 'son', 'daughter', 'message', 'would', 'be', 'intellectual', 'artist', 'former', 'ruling', 'classes', 'have', 'role', 'new', 'Russia', 'Pasternak', 'had', 'allowed', 'Zhivago', 'escape', 'Mongolia', 'Laura', 'message', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'same', 'exception', 'choice', 'based', 'passion', 'Thus', 'romantic', 'dreamer', 'very', 'hard', 'objective', 'decision', 'live', 'isolation', 'two', 'women', 'love', 'abstract', 'love', 'motherland', 'good', 'novel', 'good', 'film', 'credibility', 'lived', 'experience', 'anyone', 'forces', 'single', 'man', 'forces', 'brutal', 'history', 'often', 'defeat', 'Zhivago.Zhivago', 'interesting', 'character', 'are', 'shown', 'film', 'Zhivago', 'one', 'loss', 'case', 'adjusts', 'remain', 'contact', 'mystical', 'beautiful', 'forces', 'natural', 'world', 'joy', 'Zhivago', 'watching', 'sun', 'rise', 'sun', 'set', 'wind', 'snow', 'ice', 'are', 'contrasted', 'forces', 'man', 'take', 'so', 'much', 'young', 'man.If', 'one', 'criticism', 'film', 'often', 'Bolsheviks', 'are', 'shown', 'opportunistic', 'manipulative', 'power', 'hungry', 'intolerant', 'ideologues', 'tendency', 'portray', 'aristocrats', 'French', 'Russian', 'revolution', 'be', 'genteel', 'saints', 'revolutionary', 'forces', 'be', 'power-drive', 'murderers', 'Balance', 'needed', 'when', 'work', 'art', 'not', 'portray', 'sides', 'fairly', 'Suppose', 'films', 'American', 'revolution', 'showed', 'British', 'highly', 'civilized', 'intelligent', 'victims', 'bunch', 'wildly', 'control', 'violent', 'New', 'English', 'colonists', 'would', 'hardly', 'think', 'view', 'accurate', 'French', 'Russian', 'revolutionists', 'are', 'often', 'portrayed', 'films', 'homicidal', 'opportunists', 'criminals.The', 'films', 'David', 'Lean', 'are', 'sweeping', 'visual', 'approach', 'storytelling', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'capturing', 'Russian', 'motherland', 'grasp', 'civil', 'war', 'recommend', 'film', 'highly', 'romance', 'history', 'artistic', 'telling', 'great', 'tale', 'be', 'aware', 'how', 'subtle', 'clues', 'film', 'reveal', 'Pasternak', 'one-sided', 'political', 'philosophy']",Doctor Zhivago VHS

The three and a half hour run time allows plenty of room for side plots, but the main tale is of Zhivago's path crossing with Lara on several occasions - through chance, through war, and through communist desperation - and how his marital fidelity is eventually defeated.The interplay between the main characters and the large supporting cast is fantastic.

I can't believe that Omar Sharif was not the first, second, or even third actor considered for this part.  He played the role of Zhivago so beautifully.  I loved him and Alec Guinness in Lawrence of Arabia, and though they don't share much screen time together, they are truly amazing to watch.The story takes place over several years leading up to and through the Bolshevik revolution.  The story is told by Alec Guinness' character years later to a young woman whom he suspects is Zhivago's long lost daughter (no spoiler, it's revealed within the first three minutes).  The resulting tale is one of love and loss.  Zhivago is torn between two women, and in fact two lives, but all is thrown into chaos during the revolution as well as World War I.It is not a war film, the revolution and war take place mainly in the background, although the characters are swept into these chaotic events.

381264,A1A3T2KJE8R71U,6303599109,Christopher C Jackson,"[14, 16]","In 1965 David Lean set out to do something many people thought impossible - convert Robert Pasternak's sweeping novel Doctor Zhivago to the big screen. In achieving just that he produced the most astonishing film of his career and underlined his status as a truly masterful and unique director.Restricted more than ever before by a tight Hollywood deadline and confronted by a daunting array of the world's most unwelcoming locations, Dr Zhivago perhaps better fits Steven Spielberg's description of Lawrence of Arabia as ""a miracle of a film"". Shot mainly in Spain (!) this Russian epic excels in just about every department. The cinematography in any Lean film is impressive, but is more striking here because of the sheer spectrum of colours utilised, and the contrasting effects required.Pasternak's novel stretches through all four seasons and certainly every imaginable climate so the challenge for directors of photography Nicholas Roeg and Freddie Young was great, but the results of their work are sumptuous. The opening funeral sequence with the falling leaves is unforgettable, the shots of sweeping landscapes give a real sense of the story's epic scale and the harsh impact of the Russian winter is beautifully yet brutally displayed in the snow covered locations.The acting is also impeccable. An international cast including Julie Christie, Rod Steiger and Omar Sharif gel together in a way only very few casts do, which can be partly attributed to Lean's direction, as the fascinating DVD documentary reveals. Refusing to mix with the actors after filming, Lean was always totally focused on the characters he wanted them to portray, and drew out of his cast their finest performances. When Omar Sharif was worried about the way he should portray Zhivago for instance, Lean described his vision of the doctor as a poet ""observing"" the devastating events around him. In the final film, there are many occasions when Zhivago is shown alone, in silence, simply looking at the world, yet they remain mesmerising because of the look in his eyes.Despite the political backdrop of the Russian revolution, Dr Zhivago is essentially a love story, and it works beautifully as such. Lean's achievement is similar to that of the book in that he manages to create empathy for Zhivago's character. An adulterer leading a double life, he is depicted as a victim of his heart, an admirable man who has become a victim of tumultuous circumstance. When he dies at the end of the film, it is suitably fitting that it should be of, quite literally, a broken heart.Robert Bolt's screenplay deservedly won an Oscar for this film, but if there was ever an example of a film owing its success to the entire cast and crew then this is it. Lean directed proceedings, but the individual cogs (actors, art directors, set designers, costume designers, cameramen) worked so well together that Dr Zhivago should be deemed the result of a real team effort. They created a masterpiece of epic cinema.As for the DVD - the documentary is far more interesting than Columbia's one for Lawrence of Arabia, and when you consider that there are ten additional short films and an audio commentary featuring Lean's wife also included, the package becomes irresistible. And this film just has to be seen in widescreen.",5,Best Lean Film - in my opinion,1017187200,"03 27, 2002",2002,3291,"['1965', 'David', 'Lean', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'something', 'many', 'people', 'thought', 'impossible', 'convert', 'Robert', 'Pasternak', 'sweeping', 'novel', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'big', 'screen', 'achieving', 'just', 'produced', 'most', 'astonishing', 'film', 'career', 'underlined', 'status', 'truly', 'masterful', 'unique', 'director.Restricted', 'more', 'ever', 'tight', 'Hollywood', 'deadline', 'confronted', 'daunting', 'array', 'world', 'most', 'unwelcoming', 'locations', 'Dr', 'Zhivago', 'perhaps', 'better', 'fits', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'description', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'miracle', 'film', 'Shot', 'mainly', 'Spain', 'Russian', 'epic', 'excels', 'just', 'department', 'cinematography', 'Lean', 'film', 'impressive', 'more', 'striking', 'here', 'sheer', 'spectrum', 'colours', 'utilised', 'contrasting', 'effects', 'required.Pasternak', 'novel', 'stretches', 'four', 'seasons', 'certainly', 'imaginable', 'climate', 'challenge', 'directors', 'photography', 'Nicholas', 'Roeg', 'Freddie', 'Young', 'was', 'great', 'results', 'work', 'are', 'sumptuous', 'opening', 'funeral', 'sequence', 'falling', 'leaves', 'unforgettable', 'shots', 'sweeping', 'landscapes', 'give', 'real', 'sense', 'story', 'epic', 'scale', 'harsh', 'impact', 'Russian', 'winter', 'beautifully', 'yet', 'brutally', 'displayed', 'snow', 'covered', 'locations.The', 'acting', 'also', 'impeccable', 'international', 'cast', 'including', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'gel', 'together', 'way', 'only', 'very', 'few', 'casts', 'do', 'can', 'be', 'partly', 'attributed', 'Lean', 'direction', 'fascinating', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'reveals', 'Refusing', 'mix', 'actors', 'filming', 'Lean', 'was', 'always', 'totally', 'focused', 'characters', 'wanted', 'portray', 'drew', 'cast', 'finest', 'performances', 'When', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'was', 'worried', 'way', 'should', 'portray', 'Zhivago', 'instance', 'Lean', 'described', 'vision', 'doctor', 'poet', 'observing', 'devastating', 'events', 'final', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'occasions', 'when', 'Zhivago', 'shown', 'alone', 'silence', 'simply', 'looking', 'world', 'remain', 'mesmerising', 'look', 'eyes.Despite', 'political', 'backdrop', 'Russian', 'revolution', 'Dr', 'Zhivago', 'essentially', 'love', 'story', 'beautifully', 'such', 'Lean', 'achievement', 'similar', 'book', 'create', 'empathy', 'Zhivago', 'character', 'adulterer', 'leading', 'double', 'life', 'depicted', 'victim', 'heart', 'admirable', 'man', 'who', 'become', 'victim', 'tumultuous', 'circumstance', 'When', 'end', 'film', 'suitably', 'fitting', 'should', 'be', 'quite', 'literally', 'broken', 'heart.Robert', 'Bolt', 'screenplay', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Oscar', 'film', 'was', 'ever', 'example', 'film', 'owing', 'success', 'entire', 'cast', 'crew', 'then', 'Lean', 'directed', 'proceedings', 'individual', 'cogs', 'actors', 'art', 'directors', 'set', 'designers', 'costume', 'designers', 'cameramen', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'Dr', 'Zhivago', 'should', 'be', 'deemed', 'result', 'real', 'team', 'effort', 'created', 'masterpiece', 'epic', 'cinema.As', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'Columbia', 'one', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'when', 'consider', 'are', 'ten', 'additional', 'short', 'films', 'audio', 'commentary', 'featuring', 'Lean', 'wife', 'also', 'included', 'package', 'irresistible', 'film', 'just', 'be', 'seen', 'widescreen']",Doctor Zhivago VHS

381271,A25CZCHLNH3OMO,6303599109,Cuckoo Pine Nut,"[1, 2]","I wonder if that also refers to Picture meaning Movie. In this review it does. Let's see if I can push my limit of 1000 words!I kept seeing this movie on the shelf at the library. I knew nothing about it except that it was some Russian thing with an amazing train scene of some kind and some famous theme music called Lara's Theme. But knowing that it is a revered classic, I decided finally to check it out, because I am an avid viewer of good cinema.I was not at all let down. I have to admit I was prepared to be, because I am not impressed with a lot of movies mid-sixties onward (and because it never pays to expect too much), but I discovered that this one still had a lot of the art and so forth that went into movies in the decades prior.I think that the characters are well cast. Omar Sharif is convincing as Zhivago - a peaceful doctor who seems to have great love for humanity. (A doctor should, after all.) He does have a funny way of twitching his eyes back and forth though. Julie Christie is good as Lara as well, even though her tall sixties hair is rather out of place. The cousin or whoever the girl was that Zhivago married (her name escapes me) reminded me of a girl I know and I liked her quite a bit as well even with the beehive hairdo. Komorovsky (sp?) was a bit confusing to me, and next time I watch the movie I will have to pay more attention because I never was totally sure exactly what connection he has with Lara and her mother, although it was obvious he considered Lara his to do what he liked with. [I just checked in the book at Borders. Komorovsky was a lawyer who advised Lara's mother.] The actor who played Pasha, Lara's fianc&eacute;, was sufficiently creepy to do the Communist. Somehow the glasses intensify the effect.The story itself is very good too, but I won't go into that because the purpose of watching the movie is to discover the story. I'll just say that it is well laid out for the most part, doesn't really drag, bla bla bla. When I said &quot;for the most part&quot;, I'm referring to Zhivago's fling with Lara, which was far from clear to me. He seemed to adore his wife before, during and afterwards - so why was he with Lara? Maybe I missed something. I felt though that the scenes concerning the affair were basically handled tactfully, which was nice. It toned down the pitifulness of it a lot.There were many artistic moments as well. The first one that struck my subconscious was the gathering of the Communist supporters and their marching and singing through the streets. Everything in the street is grey with winter; everyone is dressed in dull colours. The only thing that you see is the red flags of the party, garish and somehow sinister. Another good moment was the &quot;weeping sunflowers&quot; on the army hospital table. After Lara (as nurse) leaves Zhivago to go home, he stands in the deserted building, once again all grey. You see only the sunflowers, their petals dropping one by one. Then there was the train tunnel part after the Entr'acte, when the screen is all black and you are just beginning to wonder if something's wrong with your set when suddenly the light at the end of the tunnel appears. This is not the famous train sequence I referred to earlier (this scene is when the multitudes board the train). But the suspense of the blackness is marvellous. Forget that I mentioned it so you will find it fresh and interesting when you see this for the first time. Oh, and at the beginning of the movie is another good sequence. Zhivago as a child watching his mother be buried and spending his first night with his new family. The branches hitting the window frighten him, and you can just really feel for him because he lost his mother, and now he's all alone in a big dark room.The costumes were brilliant too. I really love Russian outfits. The dark blue coat Zhivago wears near the beginning with the two rows of buttons is amazing, and the rest of his outfits are pretty nifty as well. I vaguely remember a beautiful red coat of Lara's with black fur trim. So they were all good pretty much except that horrible red dress Komarovsky made Lara wear to dinner - you could really feel her strong dislike of the outfit.And the music. Lara's Theme has been driving me crazy for weeks now since I've heard it. It's very beautiful, but even the most beautiful things can drive one crazy when they chase and tumble about in your head incessantly.The Communists brought a great change to Russian life. I guess I never really thought about it before seeing this movie. It must have been a difficult adjustment for a lot of people. Zhivago came home from the Revolution to find his house full of other people, because he had extra room that he could share with others, whether or not he would have wanted it that way. And the children afterwards were taught to make fun of the former Tsar. Very sad that what was supposed to be a good thing for the people ended up so badly.Well, I think I've about said a thousand words. Last time I checked it was 969, and after I've edited this, it'll be more! So watch this movie and have a lot of fun!",4,A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words,1030665600,"08 30, 2002",2002,5119,"['wonder', 'also', 'Picture', 'meaning', 'Movie', 'review', 'Let', 'see', 'can',

Omar Shariff performance conveys this human dignity flawlessly, with his burning eyes.Lara, Zhivago's second love played by Julie Christie is equalled by Tonya, played by Geraldine Chaplin for their beauty and brave kindness in the face of their descent into sadness and sorrow.And the film is radiant, with stunning colors, facinating period costumes, and a good deal of symbolic and cinemtographic experimentation that makes the film much more than a shmaltzy epic.With this DVD version, you can watch the 3 hour and 20 minute movie once, then watch the entire thing again with a commentary track.

I, for one, am pleased that audiences flocked to it in all-time record numbers.  It deserves to be one of the most popular films ever made.  The grand scale of the production, combined with the meticulous attention to detail in every shot is utterly awe-inspiring.  Many who are accustomed to the movies of today find it slow-moving. With the development of home theater technology and the glorious new Blu Ray edition which recently became available, it can be viewed with dazzling clarity on giant screens.  When seen this way by discerning viewers, it will seem to move a lot faster.  The reason for this is simple.  If you are confronted with its astounding visual splendor, any shots that might seem to linger too long on a smaller screen will engulf you in their visual wondrousness.  Still, there are always critics.  I have found numerous comments online by those who find this Blu Ray remastering to be, in one way or another, disappointing.  Have recently seen the thing blown up on a huge projection screen, I am astounded by these quibbles.  The new version is marvelous!  That David Lean and all of those who participated in the making of this picture should have succeeded in arriving at such a level of perfection in every aspect of the production will never cease to strike me as a miracle.  I've seen dozens of epic scale movies, boasting casts of thousands, but never a single one that demonstrated such meticulous and tasteful devotion to perfecting every detail.  For just one example, watch carefully the treatment of the funeral of Yuri's mother.  The way the director devised the scene to enter into the psyche of an overwhelmed small boy at such a terrible time in his life, all framed in the exotic scenic and cultural surroundings of its breathtaking location and long-ago period in time, amounts to such a gift to lovers of great motion pictures as can never be repaid.",5,A Fabulous Cinematic Feast,1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,2009,"['know', 'history', 'critics', 'reaction', 'film', 'know', 'met', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'one', 'am', 'pleased', 'audiences', 'flocked', 'all-time', 'record', 'numbers', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'grand', 'scale', 'production', 'combined', 'meticulous', 'attention', 'detail', 'shot', 'utterly', 'awe-inspiring', 'Many', 'who', 'are', 'accustomed', 'movies', 'today', 'find', 'slow-moving', 'development', 'home', 'theater', 'technology', 'glorious', 'new', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'edition', 'recently', 'became', 'available', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'dazzling', 'clarity', 'giant', 'screens', 'When', 'seen', 'way', 'discerning', 'viewers', 'will', 'seem', 'move', 'lot', 'faster', 'reason', 'simple', 'are', 'confronted', 'astounding', 'visual', 'splendor', 'shots', 'might', 'seem', 'linger', 'too', 'long', 'smaller', 'screen', 'will', 'engulf', 'visual', 'wondrousness', 'Still', 'are', 'always', 'critics', 'have', 'found', 'numerous', 'comments', 'online', 'who', 'find', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'remastering', 'be', 'one', 'way', 'disappointing', 'Have', 'recently', 'seen', 'thing', 'blown', 'up', 'huge', 'projection', 'screen', 'am', 'astounded', 'quibbles', 'new', 'version', 'marvelous', 'David', 'Lean', 'who', 'participated', 'making', 'picture', 'should', 'have', 'succeeded', 'arriving', 'level', 'perfection', 'aspect', 'production', 'will', 'never', 'cease', 'strike', 'miracle', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dozens', 'epic', 'scale', 'movies', 'boasting', 'casts', 'thousands', 'never', 'single', 'one', 'demonstrated', 'such', 'meticulous', 'tasteful', 'devotion', 'perfecting', 'detail', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'watch', 'carefully', 'treatment', 'funeral', 'Yuri', 'mother', 'way', 'director', 'devised', 'scene', 'enter', 'psyche', 'overwhelmed', 'small', 'boy', 'terrible', 'time', 'life', 'framed', 'exotic', 'scenic', 'cultural', 'surroundings', 'breathtaking', 'location', 'long-ago', 'period', 'time', 'amounts', 'gift', 'lovers', 'great', 'motion', 'pictures', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'repaid']",Doctor Zhivago VHS

His skill as a director compensates for the sappier elements of ""Doctor Zhivago"".  There is such richness of detail in this film.  The art direction, cinematography, the classic score by Maurice Jarre are all first-rate.  He assembled a first rate supporting cast here that includes Alec Guiness, Ralph Richardson, Geraldine Chaplin, Rita Tushingham.  Special mention has to be given to Rod Steiger as the villainous Victor and Tom Courtenay as the true-believing Communist Pasha.  What detracts from the film are the nominal stars of this film and the central love story.  Omar Sharif as Yuri, though good in a supporting role in ""Lawrence of Arabia"", does not have the heft as an actor to carry a film of this scope.  Julie Christie as Lara, though a good actress, comes off somewhat cold and aloof.  Now this style may have served her well in ""Darling"", the film she won the Oscar for, but we are supposed to be empathetic to her character.  She doesn't come off as any more likable than Victor.  And what of Yuri's subversive poetry?  Why are we not given any examples of it?  That said, I recommend this film for the richness of the production values.

The film moves backward in time in a flashback and shows us the story of the Bolshevik Revolution and how this affected the life of Dr. Zhivago, Lara, the corrupt Komsrovsky (Lara's lover), and Pasha. Lara becomes the woman of each of these men, but the relationship is always different. Komarovsky takes advantage of her youth and exploits her sexually, while maintaining a relationship with her mother. Later, he forbids Lara from marrying Pasha and rapes her. Lara tries to kill him, but fails and she marries Pasha. In the meanwhile WWI begins and Russians go to war. At the end of the war, the Bolsheviks take over and Pasha becomes one of it's great leaders. During the revolution, the middle-class lose their property, concepts such as family are abolished, and Dr. Zhivago and his family are displaced from their community. It is while aiding Bolsheviks as a doctor that he meets Lara, who works as a nurse. Later on, Lara will develop another relationship with Zhivago that is not bound by property or law, but it is based on a love that defies all these conventions. The revolution will succeed in separating this new relationship, but their love will be immortalized in a poem. The film is visually stunning, the soundtrack and cinematography are poetic, and the motive is compelling. The story shows how a world ruled by corruption, represented by Komarovsky, and pure idealism, represented by Pasha, threaten to stifle the human spirit, which is represented by the true love between Zhivago and Lara. I also love the motifs added by Lean, such as Zhivago always looking through windows or glass, the ice, and the flowers of purity and innocence, which correspond very much to the story of a doctor poet.

Grand in scope (do we expect anything but from David Lean?) yet personal in scale, the film is less a point A to point B story as it is snippets of a man's life, the trials he faces and the women he loves.At three hours and twenty minutes, this is a long film. We linger in seemingly small moments of life. The first hour is spent simply setting up the cast of characters whose lives will become so intertwined later, or whose unexpected appearance will startle us late in the film. Yet rarely does the film feel slow. The pace, while deliberate, works.The sweep of the landscape and scope of the story is epic in proportions. We see stunning vistas and gorgeous landscapes; sprawling masses of people; a beautifully rendered Moscow; and locations that are a joy to see. Others have mentioned that &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; comes from the same realm of storytelling as ""Gone With The Wind."" That is an accurate assessment.Lean pulls out a series of great directing tricks, with stylish cinematography and cuts on par with &quot;Lawrence of Arabia's&quot; famous match-to-desert cut, giving this film a number of memorable filmmaking moments.Movie fans should be thankful that once again, one of Lean's classic films have been given a worthy DVD release.The quality on this special edition DVD release is wonderful. An impeccable image with vibrant colors and fantastic clarity, as well as rich sound, this will look great on any home theater. The only disappointment is that the film is on a two-sided &quot;flipper&quot; disc. If they don't bother you, great; they bother me, and so I mention it.The second disc of extras is jam-packed with great material, in depth looks at the film, interviews and plenty of shorter featurettes.

Although ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is clearly the best of the three, ""Doctor Zhivago is a close second.  This film has been described quite aptly as Russia's ""Gone With the Wind"" as the loves and lives of the people close to Doctor Zhivago gets told amid the backdrop of World War 1 and the Russian Revolution all the way to the Russia of the 60's.  No one can quite tell an epic story as well as David Lean does and his films are so good that they transcend time and as true classics should they age very well and hold up very well to repeated viewing.  The cast is excellent and so is the brilliant camerawork and the haunting score by Maurice Jarre.This dvd version is a real treat as the second disc is chockful of bonus extras like interviews with the cast and a good making of documentary while the main course on disc one has very good picture quality and especially good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound quality as well.  This dvd represents a remarkably well done restoration of the film which makes it an extremely enjoyable film in this day and age.  Even the digipak cardboard packaging is very well done and aesthetically appealing in design.If you are looking for David Lean's best work, you need look no further than ""Lawrence of Arabia"", this film and ""Bridge On the River Kwai"" and in that order.Highly recommended!Updated on 27 May 2011:As Amazon will not let me review this separately, I'll have to do this here:  The Blu-ray Book version is incredible!  The picture and especially the sound quality coming in DTS HD MA 5.1 surround sound are both much improved over the dvd version I reviewed above.  The booklet itself is very nice to behold and as well as the dvd version was you have to see this in Blu-ray as it's like watching a whole new film!  The greater picture and sound quality has to be experienced to be believed making this certainly worth the double dip.Very highly recommended!",5,An Epic Story That Only David Lean Could Tell!

Yury go's to live with the Gromykos and their daughter Tonya whom he later marries.The movie, which departs slightly from the book in various ways, takes us to the life and career of Yury and the turmoil of pre-revolutionary Russia and the First World War and finally of the cruelties and horrors of the Russian Revolution and the Civil War.The movie  focuses on Dr Yuri Andreyevich Zhivago and several friends and associates of his including his loyal and strong wife Tonya, the beautiful and mystifying Laryssa Fyodorovna (Lara),her husband, the self-righteous revolutionary Pavel ""Pasha"" Antipov (Tom Courtenay),  who later reappears as the cruel and mass murdering Red Army officer Strenikov. Young revolutionaries either grow out of their revolutiary ideals or become coldblooded fanatics.Lara has been involved romantically involved  with the villainous lawyer with political connections Victor Komarovsky (Rod Steiger), who tries to dissuade her from marrying Pavel and rapes her.She then attempts to shoot him at a Christmas party.Zhivago -disgusted by the poverty and injustices of Tsarist Russia - initially supports the high ideals of the Bolsheviks but after their bloody seizure of power it soon becomes clearer and clearer that the Bolsheviks are far and away crueler and more steeped in hypocrisy than even the worst elements of the Tsarist order.The love of Yuri and Lara is one of the great romances of literature like that of Romeo and Juliet ,Heathcliff and Catherine from Wuthering Heights , and Lancelot and GuinevereLara describes it a something ordained by the very forces of nature but at the same time something predestined to be destroyedHe sends a few brief , ecstatic but fearful months with her after the Civil War but hey are again cruelly separated. By this time Yuri's wife Tonya and their children have gone into exile.Komarov then reappears and Lara is forced to accompany him to the east.They are never to meet again butSPOILER WARNINGZhivago sees her briefly in Moscow before suffering a heart attack.We learn later that Lara died later inn a labour camp.Some very memorable scenes that will be familiar to those who have read the book including the scene where Zhivago meets Lara for the first time after Lara's mother has tried to commit suicide by swallowing iodine, Lara's attempt on Komarov's life and Lara and Yury's life in the cottage in Siberia.Strikingly  done and very life like, with beautiful musical background to accompany the entire range of emotions, including the well known Lara's theme by composer Maurice Jarre.",5,Classic movie epic based on the classic novel,1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,3323,"['easy', 'see', 'why', 'one', 'movie', 'classics', '20th', 'century', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'Boris', 'Pasternak', 'same', 'name.This', 'drama-romance-war', 'film', 'set', 'most', 'part', 'early', 'twentieth', 'century', 'Russia', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'Civil', 'War.The', 'first', 'scene', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'framing', 'device', 'Police', 'General', 'Yevgraf', 'Zhivago', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'time', '1950s', 'searching', 'information', 'late', 'brother', 'Yury', 'Zhivago', 'Omar', 'Shariff', 'paramour', 'Lara', 'Julie', 'Christie', '.He', 'questions', 'young', 'woman', 'Tonya', 'Komarovskya', 'Rita', 'Tushingham', 'who', 'seemingly', 'nothing.The', 'movie', 'then', 'opening', 'scene', 'little', 'boy', 'Yury', 'Tarek', 'Sharif', 'mother', 'funeral', 'early', 'twentieth', 'century', 'Yury', 'go', 'live', 'Gromykos', 'daughter', 'Tonya', 'whom', 'later', 'marries.The', 'movie', 'slightly', 'book', 'various', 'ways', 'life', 'career', 'Yury', 'turmoil', 'pre-revolutionary', 'Russia', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'finally', 'cruelties', 'horrors', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'Civil', 'War.The', 'movie', 'Dr', 'Yuri', 'Andreyevich', 'Zhivago', 'several', 'friends', 'associates', 'including', 'loyal', 'strong', 'wife', 'Tonya', 'beautiful', 'mystifying', 'Laryssa', 'Fyodorovna', 'Lara', 'husband', 'self-righteous', 'revolutionary', 'Pavel', 'Pasha', 'Antipov', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'who', 'later', 'cruel', 'mass', 'murdering', 'Red', 'Army', 'officer', 'Strenikov', 'Young', 'grow', 'revolutiary', 'ideals', 'become', 'coldblooded', 'fanatics.Lara', 'been', 'involved', 'romantically', 'involved', 'villainous', 'lawyer', 'political', 'connections', 'Victor', 'Komarovsky', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'who', 'dissuade', 'marrying', 'Pavel', 'her.She', 'then', 'shoot', 'Christmas', 'party.Zhivago', '-disgusted', 'poverty', 'injustices', 'Tsarist', 'Russia', 'initially', 'high', 'ideals', 'Bolsheviks', 'bloody', 'seizure', 'power', 'soon', 'clearer', 'clearer', 'Bolsheviks', 'are', 'far', 'away', 'crueler', 'more', 'steeped', 'hypocrisy', 'even', 'worst', 'elements', 'Tsarist', 'order.The', 'love', 'Yuri', 'Lara', 'one', 'great', 'romances', 'literature', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Heathcliff', 'Catherine', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'Lancelot', 'GuinevereLara', 'something', 'ordained', 'very', 'forces', 'nature', 'same', 'time', 'something', 'predestined', 'be', 'destroyedHe', 'few', 'brief', 'ecstatic', 'fearful', 'months', 'Civil', 'War', 'hey', 'are', 'again', 'cruelly', 'separated', 'time', 'Yuri', 'wife', 'Tonya', 'children', 'have', 'gone', 'exile.Komarov', 'then', 'Lara', 'forced', 'accompany', 'east.They', 'are', 'never', 'meet', 'again', 'butSPOILER', 'WARNINGZhivago', 'briefly', 'Moscow', 'suffering', 'heart', 'attack.We', 'learn', 'later', 'Lara', 'died', 'later', 'inn', 'labour', 'camp.Some', 'very', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'including', 'scene', 'where', 'Zhivago', 'Lara', 'first', 'time', 'Lara', 'mother', 'tried', 'commit', 'suicide', 'swallowing', 'iodine', 'Lara', 'attempt', 'Komarov', 'life', 'Lara', 'Yury', 'life', 'cottage', 'Siberia.Strikingly', 'done', 'very', 'life', 'beautiful', 'musical', 'background', 'accompany', 'entire', 'range', 'emotions', 'including', 'well', 'known', 'Lara', 'theme', 'composer', 'Maurice', 'Jarre']",Doctor Zhivago VHS

381311,A1PRIEWOCAIAPM,6303599109,Germaine,"[1, 1]","For me, there is no question.  Doctor Zhivago is the greatest film ever made.  Its scope, while daunting, is tamed to a fare-thee-well by David Lean, its director.The film spans fifty years, bridging a turn-of-the-century past, which dug its own grave, with a present and future containing a few seeds of modest hope for a truly longsuffering and civilized people.This DVD version incorporates the fruits of some monumental efforts by the people at Turner to resurrect sounds and colors which, quite frankly, had been lost by the time a VHS version was marketed in the 1980s.  That version had been woefully yellowed and was inexcusably uneven in the mixtures of the spoken and musical/sound-effects aspects of the soundtrack.  What a difference a few million digits make!  What vivid colors.  David Lean's remarkable genius for defining and obtaining ""the shot"" is given its due once again.Some, on first blush, perceive the Doctor Zhivago to have been a film of frustration and despair.  Not I.  Having seen it 222 times and memorized its every line, I see it as a metaphor on hope and the creative spirit.  Even in the symbolism of the balalaika, we should be able to perceive a ""gift"", reborn -- a gift which lay dormant through a whole generation's hard knocks, but preserved by dint of a man's unshakable courage and tenacity, then handed, even though unbeknownst, to another generation in a better day.  How fitting that the sweeping pizzicattoes of balalaika music grace the film's every turn.I could no more grow tired of this film than I could cease to enjoy looking at the huge Rubens paintings in the gallery in Brussels (or the  16 Rembrandts in the Hermitage in St. Petersburg).",5,A great one by the Rembrandt of filmmaking,1013472000,"02 12, 2002",2002,1692,"['question', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'greatest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'scope', 'daunting', 'tamed', 'fare-thee-well', 'David', 'Lean', 'director.The', 'film', 'spans', 'fifty', 'years', 'bridging', 'turn-of-the-century', 'past', 'own', 'grave', 'present', 'future', 'containing', 'few', 'seeds', 'modest', 'hope', 'truly', 'longsuffering', 'civilized', 'people.This', 'DVD', 'version', 'fruits', 'monumental', 'efforts', 'people', 'Turner', 'resurrect', 'sounds', 'colors', 'quite', 'frankly', 'had', 'been', 'lost', 'time', 'VHS', 'version', 'was', 'marketed', '1980s', 'version', 'had', 'been', 'woefully', 'yellowed', 'was', 'inexcusably', 'uneven', 'mixtures', 'spoken', 'musical/sound-effects', 'aspects', 'soundtrack', 'What', 'difference', 'few', 'million', 'digits', 'make', 'What', 'vivid', 'colors', 'David', 'Lean', 'remarkable', 'genius', 'defining', 'obtaining', 'shot', 'given', 'due', 'once', 'again.Some', 'first', 'blush', 'perceive', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'frustration', 'despair', 'Not', 'Having', 'seen', '222', 'times', 'memorized', 'line', 'see', 'metaphor', 'hope', 'creative', 'spirit', 'Even', 'symbolism', 'balalaika', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'perceive', 'gift', 'reborn', 'gift', 'lay', 'dormant', 'whole', 'generation', 'hard', 'knocks', 'preserved', 'dint', 'man', 'unshakable', 'courage', 'tenacity', 'then', 'handed', 'even', 'unbeknownst', 'generation', 'better', 'day', 'How', 'fitting', 'sweeping', 'pizzicattoes', 'balalaika', 'music', 'grace', 'film', 'turn.I', 'could', 'no', 'more', 'grow', 'tired', 'film', 'could', 'cease', 'enjoy', 'looking', 'huge', 'Rubens', 'paintings', 'gallery', 'Brussels', '16', 'Rembrandts', 'Hermitage', 'St.', 'Petersburg']",Doctor Zhivago VHS

Lean was one of the most famous, powerful men in Hollywood at the time, so he was given carte blanche for this film.  However, Lean was known for going over budget, and this film was no exception.  It took a year to shoot, and it got a reputation of a trouble production from the merciless press.  When it finally appeared, the reviews were very, very mixed.  It did very little business during its first week.  Many would have caved and pulled the film.  It would have been written off as a disaster, and Lean's reputation would have seriously wounded, possibly damaged irreversibly.  But Robert O'Brien, a man who was not a stranger to tough decisions (he greenlighted 2001: A Space Odyssey), stood his ground.  He said to Lean ""it's a good picture, David.  I'm going to put some more money into it and try and get some solid publicity.""  Essentially, MGM paid theater owners to keep the film on in their theaters.  The 2nd week of its run business picked up.  The third week it got even better, and the fourth week of its release screening were being sold out.  I love the fact that O'Brien didn't panic, didn't give in to ignorant critics, who looked like they wanted to cut Lean down to size rather than watch his film.  Lean just came off Lawrence of Arabia, considered one of the greatest films ever made, so critics were out for blood.  It shows you what standing your ground can do sometimes.  If we only had more executives like that these days.As for the film, it's a passionate, epic journey.  Visually, it's almost as extraordinary as Lawrence, except it's the snow covered vistas (shot in Finland and Spain) instead of the desert.  It's a really deeply felt, romantic film where the politics don't get in the way of the story too much.  In other words, we don't hear tons of political speeches (like in Beatty's film Reds), and we get a much more humanistic story, and the trauma of revolution and strife have upon human relationships.  Lean is a master, a genius, and the fact that he followed Lawrence with a film that can stand right next to it is remarkable.",5,"A glorious epic by the great David Lean, and from the great MGM pictures...",1197936000,"12 18, 2007",2007,2234,"['little', 'backstory', 'film', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", '.Bob', ""O'Brien"", 'head', 'MGM', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'greenlighted', 'film', 'Lean', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'powerful', 'men', 'Hollywood', 'time', 'was', 'given', 'carte', 'blanche', 'film', 'However', 'Lean', 'was', 'known', 'going', 'budget', 'film', 'was', 'exception', 'took', 'year', 'shoot', 'got', 'reputation', 'trouble', 'production', 'merciless', 'press', 'When', 'finally', 'appeared', 'reviews', 'were', 'very', 'very', 'mixed', 'did', 'very', 'little', 'business', 'first', 'week', 'Many', 'would', 'have', 'caved', 'pulled', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'off', 'disaster', 'Lean', 'reputation', 'would', 'have', 'seriously', 'wounded', 'possibly', 'damaged', 'irreversibly', 'Robert', ""O'Brien"", 'man', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'stranger', 'tough', 'decisions', 'greenlighted', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'stood', 'ground', 'said', 'Lean', 'good', 'picture', 'David', ""'m"", 'going', 'put', 'more', 'money', 'try', 'get', 'solid', 'publicity', 'Essentially', 'MGM', 'paid', 'theater', 'owners', 'keep', 'film', 'theaters', '2nd', 'week', 'run', 'business', 'picked', 'up', 'third', 'week', 'got', 'even', 'better', 'fourth', 'week', 'release', 'screening', 'were', 'being', 'sold', 'out', 'love', 'fact', ""O'Brien"", 'did', ""n't"", 'panic', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'ignorant', 'critics', 'who', 'looked', 'wanted', 'cut', 'Lean', 'down', 'size', 'rather', 'watch', 'film', 'Lean', 'just', 'came', 'off', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'considered', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'critics', 'were', 'out', 'blood', 'what', 'standing', 'ground', 'can', 'do', 'sometimes', 'only', 'had', 'more', 'executives', 'days.As', 'film', 'passionate', 'epic', 'journey', 'Visually', 'almost', 'as', 'extraordinary', 'Lawrence', 'snow', 'covered', 'vistas', 'shot', 'Finland', 'Spain', 'instead', 'desert', 'really', 'deeply', 'felt', 'romantic', 'film', 'where', 'politics', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'story', 'too', 'much', 'other', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'tons', 'political', 'speeches', 'Beatty', 'film', 'Reds', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'humanistic', 'story', 'trauma', 'revolution', 'strife', 'have', 'upon', 'human', 'relationships', 'Lean', 'master', 'genius', 'fact', 'followed', 'Lawrence', 'film', 'can', 'stand', 'right', 'next', 'remarkable']",Doctor Zhivago VHS

Omar Sharif, who had appeared in Lean's previous work, ""Lawrence Of Arabia,"" is the title character, happily married to his childhood sweetheart (Geraldine Chaplin) and haunted by the woman he can't rid his mind of (Julie Christie, in an indelible performance). Thrust into the Russian Revolution, this multi-layered story comes to life via a powerful, Academy-Award winning screenplay by Robert Bolt (who also wrote ""The Bounty""). Rod Steiger (in a rare non-overacting role) is menacing as the villainous Komarovsky. Sir Ralph Richardson (the 1948 version of Count Leo Tolstoy's ""Anna Karenina,"" Sir Laurence Olivier's ""Richard III"") and Alec Guiness (who will forever be remembered as the older Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original ""STAR WARS"" trilogy) round out the supporting cast. This is a movie to watch over and over again. Maurice Jarre's Academy-Award winning score (""Lara's Theme"" being the prominent portion of it) is haunting and poignant. Ranks with ""Gone With The Wind,"" ""Ben-Hur,"" ""William Shakespeare's Hamlet,"" (starring Kenneth Branagh, who also directed and wrote the script; please see my review on it) and Cecil B.

Omar Sharif was brilliant playing the title role that, actually, was through the eyes of the author, Boris Pasternak, who experienced a similar life as Zhivago. He, too, was married and had a mistress on the side, and like Zhivago, Pasternak would never leave Russia, even when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature that he refused because of threats of expulsion from the Soviet Union. The book was written just two years prior to Pasternak's death in 1960 and seven years before the movie was made.Also brilliant were the portrayals of the various characters such as Zhivago's wife, Tonya played by Charlie Chaplin's daughter, Geraldine Chaplin. Julie Christie's role as Lara could not have been any better than the way she portrayed it. Rod Steiger, the only American actor in the film, fit the character as the corrupt lawyer, Viktor Komarovsky. Above all, Alec Guiness who played Yuri's half brother, Yevgraf, was certainly portrayed well by this veteran actor who had starred in many feature films such as ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""The Lady Killers"" and ""Star Wars"".Maurice Jarre's score was as popular as the movie itself, especially ""Lara's Theme"". Jarre, at first, was worried that the music he composed for the movie would not be fitting to David Lean's liking.

The juxtaposition between the rich and the poor and then the fall of society into communism is absolutely heart wrenching.  But Omar Sharif's portrayal of Dr. Zhivago is all about hope during this depressing time and his bright attitude toward life is felt throughout by the viewer as well as many of the characters, but the despair is always there.  Shadows of fear, violence, betrayal, and hatred lurk all around him and Lara, played by Julie Cristie. But Dr. Zhivago is driven by hope and tireless perseverance to build a better life for his family.  Their love for one another keeps them strong and keeps them going.I must warn you that this movie is not for the faint of heart.  My husband, who had seen it a few times before, was emotional because of my sorrow filled emotion.  Yes, it took a monumental toll on me as a viewer and I continued to be affected by it hours after watching the film.  But make no mistake:  THIS MOVIE IS WORTH WATCHING.

It is a remarkable piece of work with high-quality 35 mm film that consisted of bright, superbly detailed colors and had prevalent throughout both a detailed-oriented production and a luminescent grandeur.With a setting designed to mirror Mother Russia, Doctor Zhivago, strangely enough, was shot in Spain, of all places. All the photographic elements gave a picturesque landscape reflecting very cold regions. With David Lean, Omar Sharif, Julie Christie, Geraldine Chaplin, and Alec Guinness as key players, Doctor Zhivago had a spectacular cast, and combined with a professional production crew, it could only have resulted as a high-quality entertainment epic for the big screen.A very noble person was Dr. Zhivago, a man who might be regarded as an early twentieth-century counterpart to Judah Ben-Hur. Like Ben-Hur, Zhivago was a prominent resident of his land who would be stripped of personal rights and privileges as a result of government takeover in his region and then somehow have the intelligence and persistent resourcefulness necessary for his name and dignity to be restored.An ideal epic figure, Dr. Zhivago, though not a combat warrior with specialized fighting skills as in many other epics, was a thoughtful and determined man whose demeanor was fixed.  For as a character you do not see in too many contemporary motion pictures, Zhivago thought of and felt passion for others to a degree that neither time nor distance could easily change. He was not just some fair-weather friend, many of which drama and real life seem to depict nowadays.A very nice follow-up to 1962's Lawrence of Arabia, David Lean's Doctor Zhivago in widescreen format is breathtaking and arguably might have won the Academy Award for Best Picture had it not been for the popularity of The Sound of Music, another great classic in its right.Kudos to wonderful costumes and makeup, especially that used to make Egyptian actor Omar Sharif appear as a European.

The story is basically about a poet/physician (Omar Sharif) who loves two women--his adoring wife, Tonya (Geraldine Chapin), and his enigmatic mistress, Lara (Julie Christie)--through the events of World War I and the Russian Revolution.Robert Bolt's screenplay balances the political upheaval with exquisite, heartwrenching romance--one of the few films to succeed at this level.  Lean, who seemed to make a specialty of making films about illicit love (Brief Encounter, Summertime, etc.), also works a tightrope, giving the film the necessary grandeur and sweep required for an epic while never losing sight of the intimacy of the characters.  He is aided considerably by a magnificent cast:  Sharif, despite or perhaps because of his Egyptian background, provides the perfect perspective of an individual observing things around him, each time as if it were new--it's a wonderful performance; Christie is simply luminescent; Chaplin nicely understated; and there's terrific support from Alec Guinness, Rod Steiger, Tom Courtney, etc.What makes Zhivago a must on DVD is the awe-inspiring cinematography of Freddie Young, who deservedly won the Academy Award.  I was lucky to see Zhivago at a theater, on the big screen proper, several years ago when it was re-issued; unbelievably, the DVD transfer here is even BETTER!!!

381358,A2NQ67DP3D5AXI,6303599109,Karl Ericsson,"[8, 13]","When I read the bad reviews of this film on this site, I am reminded about how I once felt about Laurel and Hardy. At that time, I did not particularly like Laurel and Hardy and I always crunched a little when there was only Laurel and Hardy playing at the matinee, that my father wanted to take me to. I had an especially hard time with Laurel and his crying-fits. Later, in school, one of my class-mates said about Laurel and Hardy that they were an insult to society and from that moment on a whole world opened to me regarding these two and I suddenly understood how funny they were and still are and how much more anarchistic they are compared to the Marx Brothers, who, by no means, are bad.I think there is a similarity here concerning this film. Russians, who see this film, do not recognize the Russia they know in this film. And I understand them. It's as if I would see a wonderfully romantic film about Sweden, where there hasn't been known to exist a virgin since the early fifties. I would laugh, of course. This film is not about Russia. It's about the joy of love, that only lasts a moment and the pain of love that lasts a lifetime (like in the song Plaisir d'amour). It's principally about the love between man and woman but also about the love of a boy towards his dead mother and the strange consolation of the wind in the tree-tops. This is a magical film that cannot grasp the mystery of love but manages to touch it and show it to us. This is a film by poets (Lean! Not Pasternak!) for poets.I guess it was politically convenient to choose a novel by Boris Pasternak in the times of the cold war. The shots of the ""ice-palace"", suggests that David Lean at least wanted a story that took place in the cold. I have tried to read the book, in order to retrieve some of the magic that I found in the film, but I had to give up. The book is such a drag.So, put your romantic glasses on, if you have any, and be ready for the ultimate trip to magic and sad ""plaisir d'amour"" of a Russia, that is so much more Russia than Russia can ever be.",5,more russia than russia could ever be,1272412800,"04 28, 2010",2010,2057,"['When', 'read', 'bad', 'reviews', 'film', 'site', 'am', 'reminded', 'how', 'once', 'felt', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'time', 'did', 'not', 'particularly', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'always', 'crunched', 'little', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'playing', 'matinee', 'father', 'wanted', 'take', 'had', 'especially', 'hard', 'time', 'Laurel', 'crying-fits', 'Later', 'school', 'one', 'class-mates', 'said', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'were', 'insult', 'society', 'moment', 'whole', 'world', 'opened', 'regarding', 'two', 'suddenly', 'understood', 'how', 'funny', 'were', 'still', 'are', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'anarchistic', 'are', 'compared', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'who', 'means', 'are', 'bad.I', 'think', 'similarity', 'here', 'concerning', 'film', 'Russians', 'who', 'see', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'recognize', 'Russia', 'know', 'film', 'understand', 'would', 'see', 'wonderfully', 'romantic', 'film', 'Sweden', 'where', 'there', ""n't"", 'been', 'known', 'exist', 'virgin', 'early', 'fifties', 'would', 'laugh', 'course', 'film', 'not', 'Russia', 'joy', 'love', 'only', 'moment', 'pain', 'love', 'lifetime', 'song', 'Plaisir', ""d'amour"", 'principally', 'love', 'man', 'woman', 'also', 'love', 'boy', 'dead', 'mother', 'strange', 'consolation', 'wind', 'tree-tops', 'magical', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'grasp', 'mystery', 'love', 'touch', 'show', 'film', 'poets', 'Lean', 'Not', 'Pasternak', 'poets.I', 'guess', 'was', 'politically', 'convenient', 'choose', 'novel', 'Boris', 'Pasternak', 'times', 'cold', 'war', 'shots', 'ice-palace', 'David', 'Lean', 'least', 'wanted', 'story', 'took', 'place', 'cold', 'have', 'tried', 'read', 'book', 'order', 'retrieve', 'magic', 'found', 'film', 'had', 'give', 'up', 'book', 'such', 'drag.So', 'put', 'romantic', 'glasses', 'have', 'be', 'ready', 'ultimate', 'trip', 'magic', 'sad', 'plaisir', ""d'amour"", 'Russia', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Russia', 'Russia', 'can', 'ever', 'be']",Doctor Zhivago VHS

381365,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,6303599109,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[2, 2]","DR. ZHIVAGO is David Lean's magnum opus film adaptation of Boris Pasternak's Nobel Prize-winning semi-autobiographical novel of the same name (Pasternak declined accepting after the authorities told him that if he went to Oslo he could never return to the U.S.S.R.).Lean's production seems rather more perfectly realized than the book (at least the English translation) despite its dangerous swerves to the edge of soap operatics. Fortunately, Lean's tight direction keeps the film from ever going over that edge.A true epic from the era of epics, the sweep of DR. ZHIVAGO is as vast and complex as Russia and the Revolution itself. Lean captures the street scenes of ""Bread and Land"" demonstrations perfectly (according to one who was there), and imbues his characterizations with a depth and sensitivity not often seen on film.The film's protagonist, young Dr. Yuri Zhivago, a noted physician and poet, finds his bourgoise life turned topsy-turvy by first the Great War and then by the Revolution. The greater external crisis of his time is matched by a personal crisis of equal internal dimensions, as he is torn between his two life's loves, his devoted wife Tonya (played by Charlie Chaplin's daughter, Geraldine), and Larissa Antipova (the beautiful Julie Christie), the wife of the hidebound, heartless Bolshevik, Strelnikov (Tom Courtenay).Lean performs a nearly impossible task, capturing the mental landscape of a poet through a series of scenic cutaways that would have seemed ridiculous in the hands of another filmmaker.Zhivago himself (played by Omar Sharif) is a sensitive, dewy-eyed man who is never able to surrender his personal life or his art to the Revolution. As seen through Zhivago's eyes, the Revolution appears coarse and impermanent. Although primarily a love story (Zhivago is Pasternak and there was a real ""Lara"" by the name of Olga), the Soviet authorities could never tolerate Dr. Zhivago's vision, and branded the book politically subversive. The humorless self-importance of the ""New"" Russians is indictment enough for an era.Made in the days before CGI, the fifty thousand extras in this film actually are fifty thousand extras, and the sets are fully-realized buildings. An early reviewer criticized the ""jack-built sets"" (which theater did he walk into?); the incredible ice palace at Varykino has attained a kind of film immortality. So has the score, highlighted by the dramatic and romantic ""Lara's Theme.""Excellent supporting roles are played by Rod Steiger as the amoral but pragmatically principled Komarovsky, Siobhan McKenna and Sir Ralph Richardson as the Gromykos, and Sir Alec Guinness as General Yevgraf Zhivago, Yuri's half-brother whose filial devotion is the underpinning of the entire film.Films simply aren't made this way anymore.",5,"""More of your high-minded lunacy?""",1120262400,"07 2, 2005",2005,2785,"['DR.', 'ZHIVAGO', 'David', 'Lean', 'magnum', 'opus', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Boris', 'Pasternak', 'Nobel', 'Prize-winning', 'semi-autobiographical', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Pasternak', 'declined', 'accepting', 'authorities', 'told', 'went', 'Oslo', 'could', 'never', 'return', 'U.S.S.R.', '.Lean', 'production', 'rather', 'more', 'perfectly', 'realized', 'book', 'least', 'English', 'translation', 'dangerous', 'swerves', 'edge', 'soap', 'operatics', 'Fortunately', 'Lean', 'tight', 'direction', 'film', 'ever', 'going', 'true', 'epic', 'era', 'epics', 'sweep', 'DR.', 'ZHIVAGO', 'vast', 'complex', 'Russia', 'Revolution', 'Lean', 'street', 'scenes', 'Bread', 'Land', 'demonstrations', 'perfectly', 'according', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'there', 'characterizations', 'depth', 'sensitivity', 'not', 'often', 'seen', 'film.The', 'film', 'protagonist', 'young', 'Dr.', 'Yuri', 'Zhivago', 'noted', 'physician', 'poet', 'bourgoise', 'life', 'turned', 'topsy-turvy', 'first', 'Great', 'War', 'then', 'Revolution', 'greater', 'external', 'crisis', 'time', 'matched', 'personal', 'crisis', 'equal', 'internal', 'dimensions', 'torn', 'two', 'life', 'loves', 'devoted', 'wife', 'Tonya', 'played', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'daughter', 'Geraldine', 'Larissa', 'Antipova', 'beautiful', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'wife', 'hidebound', 'heartless', 'Bolshevik', 'Strelnikov', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', '.Lean', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'task', 'capturing', 'mental', 'landscape', 'poet', 'series', 'scenic', 'cutaways', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'ridiculous', 'hands', 'filmmaker.Zhivago', 'played', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'sensitive', 'dewy-eyed', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'able', 'surrender', 'personal', 'life', 'art', 'Revolution', 'seen', 'Zhivago', 'eyes', 'Revolution', 'coarse', 'impermanent', 'primarily', 'love', 'story', 'Zhivago', 'Pasternak', 'was', 'real', 'Lara', 'name', 'Olga', 'Soviet', 'authorities', 'could', 'never', 'tolerate', 'Dr.', 'Zhivago', 'vision', 'branded', 'book', 'politically', 'subversive', 'humorless', 'self-importance', 'New', 'Russians', 'indictment', 'enough', 'era.Made', 'days', 'CGI', 'fifty', 'thousand', 'extras', 'film', 'actually', 'are', 'fifty', 'thousand', 'extras', 'sets', 'are', 'fully-realized', 'buildings', 'early', 'reviewer', 'criticized', 'jack-built', 'sets', 'theater', 'did', 'walk', 'incredible', 'ice', 'palace', 'Varykino', 'attained', 'kind', 'film', 'immortality', 'So', 'score', 'highlighted', 'dramatic', 'romantic', 'Lara', 'Theme', 'Excellent', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'played', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'amoral', 'pragmatically', 'principled', 'Komarovsky', 'Siobhan', 'McKenna', 'Sir', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'Gromykos', 'Sir', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'General', 'Yevgraf', 'Zhivago', 'Yuri', 'half-brother', 'filial', 'devotion', 'underpinning', 'entire', 'film.Films', 'simply', 'are', ""n't"", 'made', 'way', 'anymore']",Doctor Zhivago VHS
381366,A2XSXYU95TEN00,6303599109,"K. O. RN ""music lover""","[7, 24]","I consider David Lean to be one of the greatest filmmakers ever--but this is far from his best film. The cinematography is sweeping in it beauty (not unlike other films from its day such as the Sound of Music) and the actors were talented but the love story was so simplified that it lacked the emotional depth needed to give the characters arcs or even elicit sympathy. Such is the stuff that fluff is made.Another disappointing aspect of this film was it's award winning score. The short dominating theme (which can be heard in its entirety as the DVD menu music) reoccurs every time the star crossed lovers met or are about to meet. The variations on the theme are not well developed so we hear the same 30 seconds of mandolin music again, and again and again. Out of all of the Academy's nominations in 1965 for Substantially Original Musical Score (which included Alex North's brilliant work Agony and the Ecstasy-- Alfred Newman's awe-inspiring Greatest Story Ever Told and what many consider to be the finest musical ever filmed: Michel Legrand and Jacques Demy's Umbrellas of Cherbourg) this was the least deserving of an Oscar. I would have awarded Frank DeVol the prize for Cat Balou (also nominated) before I would have given it to Maurice Jarre for this score.After finally seeing the film--and being so disappointed--i looked into the history of the movie to discover why this is such a well-known work, and here is what i discovered: Dr Zhivago was a epic book by Boris Pasternak that was truncated for the movie stripping it of many layers of meaning. As a film it was not critically acclaimed--in fact the reviews were so bad that David Lean swore he would never make another movie again (and he didn't for almost 20 years until Passage to India). But the public loved it. Dr. Zhivago made more money, up until that point in time, than all of David Lean's previous films combined. Dr Zhavago was an anti-communist film made during the cold war (probably not an unpopular position) during an era of greater sexual repression. So a movie made in 1965 about a cheating man whose pride and extra-marital affair trumps his concern for his child and wife could--in its time--be seen as romanticized heroism. But not from many people's point of view today. The movie isn't even erotic--just shallow, slow and sad.Dr Zhavago is more comparable to Titanic (which is superior musically and artistically) than it would be to a truly great epic such as The Best Years of Our Lives or The Bridge on the River Kwai.

381369,A36T2TEF5SKPUM,6303599109,Laon,"[24, 60]","A lot of people clearly loved this movie, but here is a minority report. _Dr Zhivago_ is a film in which a lot of very talented people did some of their worst work. David Lean seems to have forgotten the &quot;motion&quot; part of the term &quot;motion pictures&quot;.  Robert Bolt provided a stilted, occasionally ludicrous script: Pasternak's book is not really a Great Novel, but it deserved better than this shallow treatment. And cast of famous names, including Ralph Richardson and Alec Guiness in smaller roles as well as Shariff and Christie, give us (with one startling exception) bland, forgettable acting.Omar Shariff and Julie Christie look good in the many (all too many)searching close-ups of their face, but Lean's focus on these essentially blank faces only emphasies the vacuity of these performances. (Julie Christie has acted well in other films, but not in this one. And Shariff, here and for the rest of his career, merely showed that his soulful performance in _Lawrence of Arabia_ was a fluke, a one-off.) Tom Courtenay's noble revolutionary, Lara's husband, is a one-note show of suffering sincerity.  Geraldine Chaplin makes no impact either, as Zhivago's long-suffering wife.The length and the ostensible subject, the Russian Revolution, make it clear that Lean intended to create Epic, but instead Lean gives us Soap Opera, another notoriously long-winded genre. The film is severely weakened by concentrating on the Eternal Triangle, with the sweeping historical events of Russia's nightmarish 20th century history as mere background. Epic needs to keep the two elements, the personal and the historical, in balance. But what _fatally_ weakens the film is the sheer banality and tedium of the personal story. Zhivago's and Lara's story is told so conventionally that it would be lucky to hold the interest for a normal film length, but at over three hours it is excruciatingly and unrewardingly slow.Lean may have been thinking of this film as his _Gone with the Wind_, another long film about people who married the wrong people, and who fail to solve their problems while history burns around them. But _Gone with the Wind_ cheerfully knew that it was soap while _Dr Zhivago_ is pompous, and _Wind_ had the benefit of strong performances at the centre and a director who believed in keeping things moving, while _Zhivago_ has a vacuum at its centre and moves as sluggishly as a frozen river.That &quot;frozen river&quot; brings us to the film's one great strength, which is where it earned most of its two stars: the cinematography, which is absolutely at its best when the cameras stop pointing at the actors and go off and film snow, rivers, trees, banks of yellow flowers, while Maurice Jarre's famous music plays. In those moments we are reminded that Lean is a great film-maker having an off-day, but still with an eye for the grand image. But when the camera cuts away and picks up on the actors again, those shortlived moments of energy and power leach away.The film's other great strength is the approximately two minutes that Klaus Kinski spends on-screen. Famous actors are boring us on a train, when suddenly an unknown face in the background draws our attention. A man in chains comes up and fills the screen, telling us he was an anarchist who fought for the revolution. Now, betrayed by Russia's new masters, he is being sent to his death. Kinski's brief, chain-rattling performance is mesmerising; for two of its 193 minutes, this film galvanises into life. Of the few images I take away from this film - banks of yellow flowers, Julie Christie's face, and Klaus Kinski's bitter anarchist - Kinski's is the only one that _moves_.It seems almost as if making the magnificent _Lawrence of Arabia_ used up all of Lean's creative juices for a time. Lean followed up _Lawrence_ with two vastly inferior films: the worthy but dull _Dr Zhivago_ and the truly awful _Ryan's Daughter_.The DVD version offers a few extras: commentary from Omar Shariff, who (not surprisingly) is not exactly insightful, and better information from Mrs Lean. In my opinion these extras don't add a great deal of value, perhaps partly because I feel that the most interesting and honest commentary might discuss how this film went so wrong. But perhaps you can't seriously expect them do acknowledge that.So if you've seen _Lawrence of Arabia_ and perhaps _Bridge on the River Kwai_, and you want more good stuff where that came from, you're likely to find this film disappointing. _A Passage to India_ is a return to form - with reservations - in Lean's Epic style.  But if you wanted to explore further with Lean's films, then his best films of all are the early non-epics, the comedy of _Blythe Spirit_ and the lively Dickens adaptations, _Oliver Twist_ and _Great Expectations_. (And above all, avoid the abysmal _Ryan's Daughter_; _Dr Zhivago_ is a failed film, but _Ryan's Daughter_'s 206 minutes of cliched nonsense are beneath contempt.)If you do watch this film, I recommend generous use of Fast Forward.Cheers!Laon",2,"-Glacial as the wintry Don, Lara. -But not as deep, Doctor.",999388800,"09 2, 2001",2001,5040,"['lot', 'people', 'clearly', 'loved', 'movie', 'here',

381371,A1WD13J9ZQ855I,6303599109,"Lawrence Charters ""-- Lawrence""","[9, 9]","I first saw ""Dr. Zhivago"" as a teenager at a theater in Reno, Nevada, at the height of summer. Despite the heat, I left the movie frozen; the film is so thoroughly Russian that I saw snowfields and ice-covered rivers and lakes for the rest of the day. The vividness consumed your imagination -- especially at the height of the Cold War. Boris Pasternak's novel couldn't even be read in the Soviet Union, yet I could watch a film about it half a world away, in the mini-sin city of Reno.That distinctly Russian brutality of politics, soul and season has lost nothing with the passage of years. ""Dr. Zhivago"" is one of the seminal epics, a film of such vastness, beauty, and precision that you fear it might lose something vital when transferred to a new medium, but in Blu-Ray the experience is, if anything, more overwhelming. The sound is certainly better; a theater in 1965 simply can't compare with what you can do in your home in 2010. And the overpowering vistas look even more overwhelming on a modern digital flat-screen TV.""Zhivago"" is a movie about one of those pivot points in history, but it is a subtle history teacher. It doesn't directly talk about how large Imperial Russia was, or how the serfs and workers were repressed, or the titanic, contrasting struggles between imperialists, traditionalists, democrats and communists. It doesn't directly judge who was right or who was wrong. Instead, it focuses on one good-hearted man, a physician, and how he was swept up by, first, World War I, and then the almost endless battles between various factions in post-revolution Russia. Throughout it all, he is an observer, but rarely an active player. He is able to see the value in almost any point of view, but unwilling to direct anyone to see his own point of view. Like most of us, he is a pawn of history.But a pawn who loves. Loves deeply and matrimonially. Loves deeply and in sin. These loves, at the core of his existence, are what sustain him as Zhivago is buffeted back and forth by horrendous, wrenching, dehumanizing forces. In this, he makes a choice: he remains human.Nearly a half century after its release ""Dr. Zhivago"" remains a powerful, beautiful, ugly, intimate and passionate film, and Blu-Ray makes it shine brighter than ever.

Adapted from the novel by Boris Pasternak and directed by David Lean, it is about the Russian Revolution. It is also a sweeping love story.Omar Sharif is cast as Yuri Zhivago, who is not only a physician, but a poet as well.  He loves his wife, played by Geraldine Chaplin.  But he also loves another woman, Julie Christie, who is married to a political activist and is also beholden to her former lover and mentor played by Road Steiger.  Everyone experiences hardships during the revolution, especially Doctor Zhivago and his wife because they were formerly of the upper class.  In one scene in particular, when they are fleeing to the countryside with their young son, they are crowded with more than dozen others into a train car where they have to stay in their berths for a full 11 days, where soup is served from a large central pot, and where they have to use the straw on the floor of the car as a bathroom.Most of the scenes are set in the snow and the cold.  It is masterfully done, especially one scene in which all the furnishings in an abandoned house are covered in snow.  I was surprised to learn that it was filmed in Spain, where a set had to be constructed to look like Moscow at the time of the revolution.  This film was produced in 1965, at the height of the cold war.  The film's impact must have been a good lesson in history for audiences too.Even though the film was over 100 minutes long, I was never bored.  I was swept up in the story and what would happen next.  And the overlapping love stories introduced a very interesting element.  Acting was excellent, so good in fact that they really lived and breathed their parts and I ceased thinking about their performances and just let the drama unfold.Considering that there was a whole disk in the DVD set devoted to special features, I was expecting some interesting interviews.  However, they were all fluff promotional pieces and didn't really add any insight into the film itself.  It didn't matter though, because Dr. Zhivago, as a movie classic, stood on its own.

381376,AD2BIAIH78QI5,6303599109,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[7, 8]","When I was a tiny lilGal, my mother bought the soundtrack of ""Doctor Zhivago"", along with ""Thoroughly Modern Millie"". These were the first LPs my family ever owned. Over and over, we played ""Doctor Zhivago"", until I knew it by heart. Even all these years later, I could sing it note for note. It's a really great score. When the movie first aired, it was a major event! Early nostalgic memories.I've seen ""Doctor Zhivago"" since then, of course. It's one of director David Lean's most famous movies, and deservedly so. What a supporting cast: Ralph Richardson, Rod Steiger, Alec Guinness. The three prinicipals were relative newcomers: Omar Sharif, Julie Christie, and Geraldine Chaplin in a love triangle of a privileged young doctor who marries his childhood sweetheart only to discover a fascinating nurse during the dark days of the Russian Revolution. Of course, the dark days of the Revolution never end for the characters, as they didn't for generations of real people. We see the dreamer poet Yuri Zhivago have to confront some of the harshest realities of the 20th century, and opt out. He opts out of responsibility and marriage, to run away with Lara, the nurse. But all dreams are necessarily limited by time constraints, and Yuri's is no different. The forces of the revolution are stronger than anyone or anything, and Yuri and Lara cannot resist them, with tragic results.There are many memorable scenes in ""Doctor Zhivago"": the massacre outside Yuri's home, when we see Shariff's eyes dart all over the screen; the woman running desperately to board the train with babe in arms; Guiness' opening question to the girl he suspects to be Yuri and Lara's daughter so many years later, ""How did you come to be lost?"" Real best thing in the movie is Rod Steiger, who takes command in every scene he enters. He's the ultimate survivor, always managing to read the times and change with them, whether it's to be a bourgeous or a bolshevik. Shariff is kind of dull, I have to admit, but since the character is a dreamer, that's allowable.Watch it for Steiger and the scenery, and don't forget to listen to that wonderful score.",4,"First of all, the score",1023148800,"06 4, 2002",2002,2133,"['When', 'was', 'tiny', 'lilGal', 'mother', 'bought', 'soundtrack', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'Thoroughly', 'Modern', 'Millie', 'were', 'first', 'LPs', 'family', 'ever', 'owned', 'over', 'played', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'knew', 'heart', 'Even', 'years', 'later', 'could', 'sing', 'note', 'note', 'really', 'great', 'score', 'When', 'movie', 'first', 'aired', 'was', 'major', 'event', 'Early', 'nostalgic', 'memories.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'then', 'course', 'one', 'director', 'David', 'Lean', 'most', 'famous', 'movies', 'deservedly', 'so', 'What', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'three', 'prinicipals', 'were', 'relative', 'newcomers', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin', 'love', 'triangle', 'privileged', 'young', 'doctor', 'who', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'only', 'discover', 'fascinating', 'nurse', 'dark', 'days', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'course', 'dark', 'days', 'Revolution', 'never', 'end', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'generations', 'real', 'people', 'see', 'dreamer', 'poet', 'Yuri', 'Zhivago', 'have', 'confront', 'harshest', 'realities', '20th', 'century', 'out', 'responsibility', 'marriage', 'run', 'away', 'Lara', 'nurse', 'dreams', 'are', 'necessarily', 'limited', 'time', 'constraints', 'Yuri', 'different', 'forces', 'revolution', 'are', 'stronger', 'anyone', 'anything', 'Yuri', 'Lara', 'can', 'not', 'resist', 'tragic', 'are', 'many', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'massacre', 'Yuri', 'home', 'when', 'see', 'Shariff', 'eyes', 'dart', 'screen', 'woman', 'running', 'desperately', 'board', 'train', 'babe', 'arms', 'Guiness', 'opening', 'question', 'girl', 'be', 'Yuri', 'Lara', 'daughter', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'How', 'did', 'come', 'be', 'lost', 'Real', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'who', 'command', 'scene', 'ultimate', 'survivor', 'always', 'managing', 'read', 'times', 'change', 'be', 'bourgeous', 'bolshevik', 'Shariff', 'kind', 'dull', 'have', 'admit', 'character', 'dreamer', 'allowable.Watch', 'Steiger', 'scenery', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'listen', 'wonderful', 'score']",Doctor Zhivago VHS
381377,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,6303599109,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[4, 4]","Over three hours in length, this epic story absolutely earned its #39 spot on the AFI top 100 with its beautiful landscapes, fantastic acting, great score, and a storyline which sucks you in and holds you to the end. I've seen this film numerous times and as I grow older it becomes more and more poignant. Sharif is a sensitive poet who is raised by a wealthy family and becomes a doctor. He also is steered into marriage with Chaplin, the sweet girl he grew up with almost as a sister. But it's Christie who captures his passion, and soon he is spending time with both of them. This is all against the chaotic backdrop of the Russian Revolution, as the family's fortunes are pulled away from them piece by piece.The complexity of the characters is one thing that always fascinates me here. Christie's mother is the kept woman of a rich, powerful man, and Christie tries to resist him. But it's not long before she's under his spell and in essence cheating on her mother with him. She lies to her fiance about what is going on as well. But it's hard to blame her, at seventeen, for being drawn in by his seductions. Chaplin is calm, even, doing her best to hold things together as the family disintegrates around her. And through it all, Sharif shines with an idealistic light, trying to hold fast to his ideals, but sometimes being quite blind to the realities of danger that are swirling around him.The landscapes also capture me. This is definitely a movie to see in the highest quality version that you can get your hands on, on a wide screen TV. The gorgeous ice palace glistens in the sun, the onion domes crystalized. The Urals tower over the landscapes. The streets of Moscow go from glittering dinner party to violent attack location to run-down location of starving peasants. There's a strong sense of just how much things change over the years - and how much nature remains the same throughout it all. The world is changing, and yet the wolves still roam the winter plains, hungry for a meal.I absolutely adore the movie. Even so, I always try to be fully objective in my reviews so I do want to point out two issues that, while fairly minor, still should be noted.First, I am half Ukrainian and grew up surrounded by people from Ukraine and Russia. I'm sure that's part of why I love the movie, with its sounds, locations, and storyline. But it has always struck me as odd that the actors are all from places other than this part of the world. The lead character, Sharif, is Egyptian. It is fascinating to me that there were no Russian / Ukrainian / etc. actors. It's not like these actors didn't exist. Kirk Douglas was born ""Issur Danielovitch"" to parents from Belarus. Many superb actors hail from this part of the world. To me it would be like having a movie about feudal Japan but having all the characters played by Americans, when there are wonderful actors that more naturally fit into the parts. I'll say again that I love the actors they DID use. I'm just curious if they tried to cast ""more authentic"" people in the roles. Sharif, for example, had to have his eyes taped to fake the look which brings to mind uncomfortable similarities to Mickey Rooney / Mr. Yunioshi in Breakfast at Tiffany's.Second, this movie is far better than most in providing a well rounded cast of men and women. So many movies are 99% male with a token female or two. Here we have a wealth of great female roles, from the obvious Chaplin and Christie to the many secondary roles like Christie's mom and Chaplin's mom. But that being said,  while there are tons and tons of male-male conversations, the women seem to only exist to talk to the men. Their purpose is to be a male interaction point. They hardly ever talk with each other! I think a Baroness briefly talks with Christie's mom about the man who is keeping her. Chaplin's mom briefly talks with her about how handsome Sharif is. So the tiny few times a woman talks with another woman, it's to add details about a man. That's it. It is just so eye opening to look at fantastic movies that have superb female leads and then to see what dialogue they're given. Then compare that with what the men have available.Again I want to say that I love the actresses here, and have the highest respect for them. That's part of my point - that the men in the movie have all sort of opportunity to engage in great dialogue. But the women, just because they're women, have a far narrower range of opportunities given to them. The novel offers incredibly powerful female-female scenes, but they're all stripped out here.An absolute must-see and must-own.

The music is light, crisp and filled with beautiful melodies. I absolutely loved the use of the hammer dulcimer and harpsichord in the main theme. The quiet, mysterious, ethereal opening credits music sounds quite a bit like the ""Lady of Shallot"" theme in the TV Anne of Green Gables and the background watercolor paintings were awesome. And I'll agree it deserved it's Academy Awards for Cinematography, costumes and sets although it was a VERY tough call for production values that year--take a look it's competition--The Sound of Music and The Greatest Story Ever Told. The movie is chock full of drop dead gorgeous shots like the ice palace, snow scenes, countryside house in the springtime and those ending pictures of the waterfall was absolutely unforgettable. The editing is very sharp and crisp. The best parts are where the camera hovers from window to window in a house in the first half when Rod Stieger is going from floor to floor, the `whoosh' dissolve when he's courting Lara at the restaurant and the look in the window when Lara is making a confession to her fianc&eacute; Pasha.But a movie needs more than picture postcard photography. It needs a good script and good acting and that is what Dr. Zhivago lacks a lot of. The best actors are Julie Christie and Rod Stieger as Lara and her lecherous landlord. Geraldine Chaplin as Tonya doesn't have much to do but looks absolutely beautiful, especially in that pink fur in her first scene and the white ball dress and proves a lovely, heartwarming, endearing presence--my heart just bled for her when her husband cheated on her. Omar Sharif is okay but what annoys me is that he goes into these self-conscious vacant open stares--eyes glazed over like he's in a trance like the scenes where a policeman tells him to stop tending to a half dead woman who got run over, getting off the train to take a look at the country and when he's looking out his cottage window playing with the frost on the window. I hate Tom Courtney's performance as the communist leader with the glasses. He has this permanent stony frown and bleary eyes that stare off into space like he's a zombie and delivers most of his lines in the same flat, dry voice. Rita Tushingham does a good job as the shy, frightened nurse but she looks like a man. The producers needed to fix her up to look a little more attractive or get someone a little more graceful and feminine like Susannah York to play the part--take a look at how good looking the character's parents were. The rest of the actors are not particularly memorable and just seem like one or the other without any flavorable personality.The script has too many holes and sloppy edges. For instance, when Alec Guinness meets up with his long lost brother Yuri Zhivago and his family in his house in Moscow, the narrator tells about the visit. Why not just show the conversation between the brothers instead of merely TELLING about it while the camera's rolling?We are told Yevgraf and Yuri are brothers but why wasn't Yevgraf present at the mother's funeral at the beginning? Why wasn't the father around? It was never made clear whether he abandoned his wife, or died or got a divorce. It was never mentioned how Yevgraf found out about his long lost brother or how he realized Rita Tushingham was his niece/his brother's illegitimate child.The screenwriter, Robert Bolt went through the trouble to create two subplots and completely neglected to tie them up. It was never explained what happened to the doctor's wife, father-in-law and son when they moved to France. How did they support themselves? Did they even make it through the snowstorm on the way to France? Did she give birth to her second child? Was it a he or a she? What happened to her two children when they grew up? We find out about Yuri's illegitimate daughter--she is an army nurse--so why not offer an explanation about his other two kids? Why do we never find out about Lara's first daughter--you know, the one she had with her husband, the communist captain? What happened to her? Is this simply a ploy to get us to buy the next movie and the next? Come on, wrap up the movie! Sure we want to know what happened to the doctor, his mistress and their child but if you are going to put these supporting characters in a movie, make them look so meaningful, pivotal and significant to the narrative (Tonya, her children, father and Lara's OTHER DAUGHTER) then have them fade away like were supposed to just forget about them then WHAT'S THE POINT OF PUTTING THEM IN THE STORY IN THE FIRST PLACE?We are told repeatedly what a great poet Yuri is but what are we shown of writings? Nothing. Do we ever find out what kind of style he uses? Do we ever hear excerpts of his poetry?  No. The poetry had nothing whatsoever to do with the plot. So why mention it? You got me.In all the years he had his mother's dulcimer he never took the time to find a case for it? Come on.But the main reason I give this movie one star is not because of the technical aspects. I just hate the story. To be frank Yuri's character just sucks and it's impossible to care for him because all he cares about is fulfilling his desires. What about the wife he left heavily pregnant to fend for herself for another woman? He is captured by the communist army and forced to serve as a physician. He waits for a chance to escape and finally makes it. What really made me hate the movie though is when he calls out his wife's name in terrible anguish several times while treading through the blizzard, half frozen. I thought ""Oh. I get it. He feels remorseful for cheating on her. Now he's going to go find her and his child and stay with them."" And I figured Yuri was going to become a more likeable character; that he would allow the hardships in his life to become the impetus to his transformation into a better person."" But NNNNNOOOOOOO! That's not it at all! As soon as he gets home where does he go? Back to his blithering blond bimbo!There's something that just repulses me about the whole movie--how it's set up. The script is written in such a matter that we're supposed to sympathize with Yuri and his mistress Lara because they can't achieve true love and can't help themselves. He just couldn't find the right woman in his life. She just couldn't find the right man in her life. I don't feel any REAL love here, just superficial attraction to the outer shell--downright lust. Why should I care about them? They were both unlikeable characters. Who cares what they say or do? Who wants to watch a couple of lousy people doing truly lousy things? I just don't get it.I just hated the film's ending. So abrupt, anti-climatic and leaves one with the feeling of pointlessness and waste.I'll grant the Academy singled out the technical aspects of the film and rightly so because they were magnificent but when a movie strikes me as an overall repulsive one such as this does I can't get hyped over any of its components.",1,Picture postcard cinematography alone does not make a great

Producer DaPonti didn't want the expense of 70mm Panavision which Lean had used for LOA, so Lean was forced to use Technoscope, a widescreen process that uses half the 35mm frame to create the 2:1 aspect ratio of 70mm Panavision. What's that mean to you and me? From the beginning, the quality of the picture suffered from comprimise. First of all, you try writing a comprehensible script from Pasternak's overrated novel. But it was a hot property, DaPonti owned it, and Lean got stuck with it (well stuck himself with it). Robert Bolt had an impossible task trying to adapt this book into a feature-length film, and did not do well. For example, the novel ends with Lara and Yuri's child dying in punishment battalion during Stalingrad - not waltzing off over a useless dam. And of course, Omar Sharif was not a first choice, but he did carry LOA acting like himself, an Egyptian child of privilege;a Russian poet, even a middle-class one like Zhivago, is a great reach from someone not raised in that values. A great actor could do it. Well.Murky picture, murky script, murky leading man: that's this film. Much loved for it's scope, sweep, and flowers, The Good Doctor rattles on. For a chuckle, dig how Lean shoots Christy exactly like his shot the equally blond and blue-eyed Peter O'Toole in LOA, and the equally blond and blue-eyed Christopher Jones in Ryan's Daughter.Still, I love this film. There are great moments amid the clutter; Rod Stieger is acting in another film, and Klaus Kinski as the Anarchist sentenced to forced labor seems the only authentic person. Everyone else looks too English, and of course, Sharif is Egyptian. What a mess!In a perfect world, Lean would have had the resources Warren Beatty did for ""REDS.""

Having never seen it before, and having recently rediscovered the joys of David Lean's LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (wow, what a great film!), I watched ZHIVAGO with fresh eyes.My first reaction:  ZHIVAGO, whether you've seen it or not, is part of America's film culture.  I knew ""Lara's Theme"";  The snowy, Russian scenes and Julie Christie's blond hair were somehow familiar to me!The DVD looks spectacular.  The anamorphic transfer is clean and crisp.  The overture and intermission music are included.  The documentary, featuring a mature (and still distinguished) Omar Sharif, is illuminating -- especially discovering that ZHIVAGO was filmed in Spain!As for the film ... I hate to admit that I had a few problems with it that kept me from suspending my disbelief -- which is necessary, sometimes, to believe in what you're seeing on the screen.  For instance, although the film takes place in Russia, almost everyone speaks with a British accent.  The peasants seems to have Russian accents, though.  Omar Sharif, although really wonderful as the Doctor, and although he endured some subtle makeup to change his Egyptian looks, still looks like Sherif Ali Ibn El Kharish from LAWRENCE -- not a Russian doctor.  Julie Christie, a beautiful woman who was 24 when ZHIVAGO was made, plays Lara as a 17 year old.  I didn't buy it.On the positive side, Rod Steiger is deliciously evil as Komarovsky.  And Geraldine Chaplin lights up the screen as Tonya.Then there's the love story.  According to the documentary, Lean wanted Sharif to play Zhivago as a watcher -- the film is through his eyes, almost passively.  Therefore, I never understood how Zhivago felt about having two lovers at the same time.  He kissed his wife goodbye then galloped off to make love to Lara, then returned to his wife.  I didn't understand this.  He lived with his wife in the cottage.  Lara got to stay in the ice mansion.  I am a sucker for a good love story, but Lara and the Doctor simply confused me.I don't deny that DOCTOR ZHIVAGO features some amazing performances and some very fine directing and cinematography.  I found it a little long and pushing the believability limits, however.I'll take a David Lean film any day, though!

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[4, 5]","""Doctor Zhivago"" (1965) is simply an outstanding film, directed by David Lean and based on a novel of the same written by Boris Pasternak. How good is it? Well, it lasts more than three hours, but that doesn?t seem long, as you quickly become immersed in the story.The movie begins with a flashback, as General Yevgraf Zhivago (Alec Guinness) is looking for the lost daughter of his dead brother, Yuri Zhivago, and a woman named Lara. Zhivago s book, ""Lara s poems"", was forbidden for a long time in the URSS, but has given him fame. Yevgraf talks to a beautiful young woman (Rita Tushingham) that could well be Zhivago s daughter, and he begins to tell her the story of her parents.Truth to be told, I cannot describe well enough all you will see in this movie. Suffice it to say that ""Dr. Zhivago"" is an incredibly good love story, set against the backdrop of the First World War and the Russian revolution. Yuri (Omar Sharif) is a doctor and a poet whose opinions eventually land him in trouble, as they are far from politically correct. Lara (Julie Christie) is a woman that has survived very tragic events, and that married the wrong man, a fanatic obsessed with revolution who thinks that ""The personal life is dead in Russia. History has killed it"". Lara and Yuri briefly meet each other in their youth, but it is only much later that they realize they are in love. Unfortunately, by that time they both are married.

381392,A3ENN25NFADE1X,6303599109,MBrian,"[2, 5]","The reason why I think its him at his best is because of the feeling and texture of the movie. It was uncanny but simple. The movie takes place at a time with a young girl and a policemen(Alec Guiness)who is looking for his brothers daughter(which is his niece). After a boring yet interesting scene we go through an odyssey of sadness, beauty and action. But I must warn everybody if they hate narrarating that Alec Guiness is the narrarator of this classic and I find narrarating very annoying because it leaves me thinking that the director was getting desperate and didn't think that the plot was good enough, I mean think about it, did Lawrence of Arabia need narrarating? Did Eyes Wide Shut narrarating? ''NO''. But there are some movies that worked well with narration. The Color Purple, Girl Interrupted, and some of Stanley Kubrick's classics like Dr.StrangeLove, Full Metal Jacket,and Clockwork Orange. Raging Bull, Pulp Fiction,Godfather,And Meanstreets became classics without narraration. But besides all that it was Omar Sherriff's best Movie next to Lawrence of Arabia.The acting was superb and it really was David Leans best film not just because of the directing, because the film's direction was different from Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge to the River Kwai but because the movie wasn't just dark like River Kwai and it wasn't light hearted like Lawrence Of Arabia it was both. I guess David Lean wanted the narraration because he felt like he needed it for this picture to connect it somehow, because everytime I think about it and I feel like no other director can do this film.",5,"""David Lean At His Best""",1093996800,"09 1, 2004",2004,1599,"['reason', 'why', 'think', 'best', 'feeling', 'texture', 'movie', 'was', 'uncanny', 'simple', 'movie', 'place', 'time', 'young', 'girl', 'policemen', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'who', 'looking', 'brothers', 'daughter', 'niece', 'boring', 'yet', 'interesting', 'scene', 'go', 'odyssey', 'sadness', 'beauty', 'action', 'must', 'warn', 'everybody', 'hate', 'narrarating', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'narrarator', 'classic', 'find', 'narrarating', 'very', 'annoying', 'thinking', 'director', 'was', 'getting', 'desperate', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'plot', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'mean', 'think', 'did', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'need', 'narrarating', 'Did', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'narrarating', 'are', 'movies', 'worked', 'well', 'narration', 'Color', 'Purple', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'classics', 'Dr.StrangeLove', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Godfather', 'Meanstreets', 'became', 'classics', 'narraration', 'was', 'Omar', 'Sherriff', 'best', 'Movie', 'next', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia.The', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'really', 'was', 'David', 'Leans', 'best', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'directing', 'film', 'direction', 'was', 'different', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'dark', 'River', 'Kwai', 'was', ""n't"", 'light', 'hearted', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'was', 'guess', 'David', 'Lean', 'wanted', 'narraration', 'felt', 'needed', 'picture', 'connect', 'somehow', 'everytime', 'think', 'feel', 'other', 'director', 'can', 'do', 'film']",Doctor Zhivago VHS

381396,AL4MKKO24563R,6303599109,Michael K. Beusch,"[31, 112]","Doctor Zhivago, to put it mildly, is simply the most overrated film of all time. Dull doesn't even begin to describe this unbelievably tedious and overinflated film. Besides some admittedly beautiful photography and the always luminous Julie Christie, this one's a dud with a capital D.Dr. Z is filmed against the backdrop of a monumental event in world history -- the Russian Revolution. Yet the film (and the book, for that matter) misses a golden opportunity to involve the characters in that event. To be blunt, all Zhivago and Lara are interested in doing is performing the horizontal hokey-pokey. It's meaningless when their lives are affected by the revolution because they care only about their own self-interest. The Russian Revolution is basically reduced to a plot device that separates the two lovers. I didn't care one bit about any of the characters.The failure of the film is even more glaring considering the talent involved: Omar Sharif, Julie Christie, Rod Steiger, Alec Guiness, Tom Courtenay, Ralph Richardson in the cast; David Lean directing and Robert Bolt - screenplay. Yet the film is about as involving as a toilet paper commercial. Especially ridiculous is the sequence where the then 50-ish Alec Guiness has to play his character as a teenager in a flashback sequence. Guiness looks like a middle aged man going through a midlife crisis -- all he's missing is a red sports car as he has the bad toupee. Even Maurice Jarre's beautiful Lara's Theme eventually lays an egg as it is repeated over and over and over and over and over again.When the American Film Institute released it's list of the 100 best American films a few years ago, Dr. Zhivago unbelievably ranked at #39. Especially when I saw that wonderful films like The Great Escape didn't make the list, I saw red when an overrated piece of motion picture excess like Dr. Zhivago made it. Particularly galling was that ""Zhivago"" ranked between the greats North By Northwest at #40 and Double Idemnity at #38.

Largely panned by the critics upon its theatrical release, the public took to the film for obvious reasons, not the least of which was Maurice Jarre's immortal ""Lara's Theme"".  You have to appreciate the film for what it is, a love story, instead of hoping for it to become something it never will, a definitive look at the Russian revolution. Omar Shariff, Julie Christie, Rod Steiger, Ralph Richardson, Rita Tushingham and Geraldine Chaplin are all amply suited for their roles.  Travelogue enthusiasts will not be disappointed though I must ruin things a little to tell you that none of the film was actually shot in 'Mother Russia'! Sorry.Warner Home Video has given us a deluxe 2-disc special edition that, while a nice effort, rather falls short of expectations.  The film has been remastered from restored elements but suffers from edge enhancement and aliasing problems that are quite distracting in several scenes.

381409,A2UUYORVIZ00UH,6303599109,Noirdame,"[0, 0]","Although I agree that this is a wonderful film (if a bit overlong), and is worth watching, I feel that, in his effort to make another ""epic"" and trying to match his incomparable ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" and ""The Bridge On The River Kwai"" , David Lean missed out on a more in-depth and meaningful plot.The novel, is more or less, a love story that takes place during the Russian Revolution, and the turmoil that this event inflicted on the human spirit. Boris Pasternak was basically calling things as he saw and experienced them, since he witnessed this upheaval. While the movie is gorgeous and fascinating to look at, and the music is superb, adding to the haunting quality of the story and the characters, the film fails to become a more intimate look at the people's lives, and therefore is missing some of the crucial elements of the book. Not to demean the late Robert Bolt, who was a very gifted screenwriter, and he deserved the Oscar he received, but he didn't (or perhaps, couldn't) recreate the labor of love that Pasternak penned.It was wonderful to see Julie Christie and Tom Courtenay together again on-screen, as they had such a smashing success with John Schlesinger's delicious ""Billy Liar"" (1963). However, the love story of Lara and Pasha, so sweetly detailed in the novel, is relegated to pretty much a back story or a minor plot element, perhaps to capitalize on Lara's destructive affair with Victor Komorovsky (the late and wonderfully devious Rod Steiger), and her upcoming, face-to-face encounter with Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif). I saw the movie before I read the novel, but even then, I felt very sorry for the character of Pasha, because we really were not given a lot of insight into him, or what it was that turned him from such an adoring lover to Lara, to the brutal Strelinkov, and since his character dies off-screen, I felt cheated out of a meaningful conclusion of that storyline. I was so touched by the book's information about their affection for one another, and the way the book had Zhivago and Pasha meet and discuss the love of both their lives - Lara. The 2003 Masterpiece Theatre TV remake starring Hans Matheson, Keira Knightley and Kris Marshall was much more faithful to the novel, and presented something closer to the full story.Julie Christie is always lovely and magnetic, and she obviously has an eye for great material. Her electric blue eyes and sensitive, full lips often say more that the viewer has heard her say. Geraldine Chaplin, as Zhivago's wife, Tonya, is sweet and gentle, but you have to wonder why she was so endlessly understanding toward him, even after he causes her so much heartbreak. The late Sir Alec Guinness is an interesting narrator to have for the story, and he always worked well with Lean. Sir Ralph Richardson and Sioban McKenna come off well as Tonya's parents, and Rita Tushingham excels in a small but pivotal role of the love child of Yuri and Lara. She was excellent in Tony Richardson's ""A Taste Of Honey"", and you have to wonder why she didn't have more of a career. Watch for the late Klaus Kinski in a brief but very effective portrayal of a man who becomes a prisoner of forced labor - his scenes on the train are riveting. Jack MacGowran has an interesting little part as well. Those 60s hairstyles do say something about the fashion then, even in a period film. You have to love to hate the despicable Komorovsky, who thought he was God's gift to women or something (and in the remake, Sam Neill is just as repulsively right in the role). Sharif's portrayal of Zhivago is impressive, but doesn't it seem like he is always brooding or crying?It has its flaws, but it is still romantic and I am still entranced with it, especially, for some strange reason, during Christmas. It is one of the best made films of all time, and it gives romantics a run for their money!

381414,A18PM27WKPXV92,6303599109,"olympio ""olympio""","[7, 9]","""Rubbish""--yes, that's the word Omar Sharif/Zhivago uses during a conversationwith Lara, and that, along with two occasions where his uncle, played by RalphRichardson, addresses him as ""old chap!"" gives an great indication of what is wrongwith this movie. Richardson was probably one of the finest actors Britain ever produced,but here he is miscast, simply because he epitomizes Britishness. And David Lean'sfilm is unbearably, ethnocentrically British.  Which, of course, means that it is somewhatof a joke. It might have been okay in the Cold War 60's for college students, evenstudents of Russian like myself, to take their dates to see. But, with the passage of time, the end of the Cold War and the increase of our knowledge about Russia, it simply appears to be a tired, creaky vehicle for some of the finest photography ever put on screen. As tothat, the blu ray is superb and does justice to Freddie Young's cinematography.I make this judgment with some degree of sadness--one relishes the loves of one'syouth. Yet,just as we might meet one of our human loves many years later and beforced by experience and ravages of time to revise our opinions about his/her physical beauty, so it is here. Yet, the physical beauty of this film is intact. It is the treatmentwhich is the culprit here, the script, which is only a tad above the sophistication levelof Rocky the Flying Squirrel's ""Boris and Natasha"" school.Robert Bolt is always thought of as a great screenwriter, and so he may have been. Herehe was apparently out of his element. Like any ""good"" screenwriter, he alters detailsfrom the novel for no apparent reason. Yuri's mother, for example, is not buried in the bookin the far eastern part of the country, but in a monastery in Moscow. The so-called""Lara poems,"" in the movie are the seventeenth part of the novel and,are mostly aboutnature and--here it comes--Jesus Christ! No wonder the Soviets didn't want the bookpublished!  There is a big picture of Stalin shown in the film--in fact, he is noteven mentioned in the novel (Stalin in fact was merely a party flunky for Lenin formost of the period covered by the novel).But this is a Cold War era film. And on and on. Another abiding sin of the script is the telescoping of the time frame of historical events around the time of the provisional government (1917) so that one isn't exactly sure exactly where we are timewise even if one knows the history of this period pretty well.Of course, David Lean himself must share some of the blame for some of these shortcomings.The burial location of Yuri's mother,for example, may have been changed at Lean's insistence,to give an opportunity to film more of the natural beauty of Spain doubling as Russia.What can not be so easily excused is turning the movie into a paean to adultery againstthe background of great historical events. Now, Pasternak's life mirrored that of Zhivago,both in the novel and the movie, in that he abandoned his wife and family to pursue an adulterous affair with another woman. The difference is that Pasternak felt guilty, both in his real life and in his novelized persona of Zhivago. Indeed, in the book his wife Tonya chides him in a letter for being a moral weakling. What does Tonya/Geraldine Chaplinchide him for in the film? Nada. She simply writes Yuri about Lara, ""I'm sure she (Lara)must be a wonderful person,"" or something to that effect. Now, this is not only falseto the book, it is utterly false to life. Nor does Yuri/Omar show much guilt. He saysone time to Lara, ""I'm not coming back!""  We know, of course, that that is ""rubbish,""and so does she. And whenever his infidelity threatens to become an issue, we canrest assured that ""Lara's Theme"" will swell up in full orchestra, Yuri/Omar will assumehis best dreamy, teary-eyed, pensive look, and it all will be laid to rest. I wouldhave respected the film more if it had simply propounded the time-worn adage that theartist is a superior being and not bound by the moral rules of lesser mortals. Anyway,shame on you, Bolt/Lean for trivializing a serious moral issue/dilemma.Omar Sharif, of course, was and probably still is a very handsome man. No complaintsthere, except that he doesn't look Russian. Julie Christie was (is?) a beautiful woman,by our western standards at least. But her role in this film reminded me of the AnnaKournikova phenomenon. She was a female Russian tennis player who couldn't win atournament but could collect a lot of ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" from American athletes--Iremember Shaquille O'Neal especially being fascinated with her beauty. The Russians wereamused by the Anna phenomenon, because there she was considered just a mid-levelbeauty. Similarly, I'm not sure Lara/Christie had the pulchritudinal goods to lurea Yuri/Omar from everything he held dear. But Lean wanted her for the role; afterall, she is British, like the director, the screenwriter, etc., etc.And this is, make no mistake, a British Russia portrayed in this film. It existsin some kind of parallel universe but has little to do with the real Russia, Pasternak,or the novel. I feel sorry for the reviewer who said he liked the film betterthan the novel. Maybe he read the original English translation by Max Hayward,which,rushed into print, left whole phrases out of sentences, and in one instanceomitted a whole paragraph ((one hopes not because of inability to translate).Fortunately,there is apparently a better, recent translation. I myself read the Hayward versionin the sixties but did not discover the novel until I read it in Russian in 2009.To sum up, one's enjoyment of this film will be inversely proportional to one'sknowledge of (1) Russia, (2) Russian history, (3) Pasternak, and (4) the novel""Doktor Zhivago."" Lean does British subjects very well, but alas, Brits can't do Russkies.For closer approximation of the book, try the Russian TV mini-series, availablewith English subtitles.",3,"Gorgeously mounted

Omar Sharif does a fantastic job as the quiet Dr. Zhivago. He doesn't say much throughout the movie, as the events are almost seen through his eyes. Lara, played by Julie Christie, was such an interesting character, as well. The two were so much in love, but yet so deeply pulled apart and kept away from each other, and the sense of longing pulled to you with the beautifully composed Lara's Theme. The genius of Boris Pasternak is so vividly revealed through this classic retelling of this story that you'd think he had a hand in the film's direction and production. Rod Steiger gives a magnificent performance as Komarovsky, as you develop a hatred for him in the beginning but a pity for him in the end, and a sense of the good he has done for Lara and Zhivago. A story told through flashback, you get a magnificent picture of the pain he's suffered through life, and the unspeakable joy.

Perhaps, to say that Omar Sharif was perfectly cast in the role of Doctor Zhivago is a good start.This film is really a love story, (but not a boring one!), with the Russian Revolution of 1917 serving as the background. Doctor Zhivago loves his wife.... but he loves his mistress too! Unfortunately for Zhivago, the Russian Revolution, especially the conflict between the ""White Russians"" and the ""Red Russians,"" pretty much nix all of his plans for a serene and joyful life. He endures a great deal of hardship, even becoming an unwilling participant, (to serve as physician), when he is kidnapped by a band of the combatants.We see the beautiful Russian countryside, (sometimes burning, unfortunately), as well as much social turmoil transpiring in the urban Russian settings. The scenery and action that takes place during the ""train transport scene"" is just fantastic and the compelling cinematography is second to none.And we get a great feel for the people of Russia during this traumatic period of social conflict. I feel that the director pulled this one off with great finesse.There are some, probably legitimate, criticisms of this DVD by other raters such as scenes cut out, etc. Yes, I'd love to see the original cut of this film the same as I savor seeing ALL of ""Cleopatra"" and/or the orginal cut and format of ""Gone with the Wind"". However, I think we still get a nice overview and summary of Pasternak's masterpiece of literature on this version. Something is better than nothing at all, is the view that I'm taking. Maybe someday, we'll get to see all three, fully and uncut.And on the topic of Pasternak, I would HIGHLY recommend that viewers read his magnificent book prior to watching the film.

381426,AWJPDFVN7FEZZ,6303599109,P. Miller,"[63, 77]","THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE DR. ZHIVAGO BLU-RAY, BOOK EDITION: I was very excited about this great movie being released on Blu-Ray and the advertised promise of the superb video and audio restorations it would offer. I couldn't wait to watch the movie when I received it from Amazon yesterday on the day of its release and I watched it in its entirety last evening. The video quality is truly excellent, but I could not believe the poor quality of the DTS audio. In order to get the sub-woofer to kick in I had to boost the volume to a level substantially higher than the range I normally use. Admittedly, this is a dialogue intense movie and not much will be going on with the sub, but one would expect a great deal more ""punch"" when the ""drama emphasis"" of the music score kicks in and when watching the sound intense action scenes. I have yet to experience this audio issue with any other DTS Blu-Ray disc in my collection and my collection ranges from very new, latest technology movies to select older classic movies such as Dr. Zhivago.Overall, this movie as a theatrical experience has improved with age and I continue to rate the movie itself as a 5 Star production, including the wonderful music score. And, as another reviewer mentioned, the movie's subject matter has become more relevant when played against the backdrop of today's political events. So, to sum up here, because my review is intended for the Blu-Ray, Book Edition of the movie my 3 Star rating is based solely on the poor quality of the Blu-Ray's DTS audio which very much fails, as promised, to come across as ""restored"".",3,Blu-Ray Edition DTS Sound Quality Lacking,1273017600,"05 5, 2010",2010,1595,"['THIS', 'REVIEW', 'IS', 'FOR', 'THE', 'DR.', 'ZHIVAGO', 'BLU-RAY', 'BOOK', 'EDITION', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'great', 'movie', 'being', 'released', 'Blu-Ray', 'advertised', 'promise', 'superb', 'video', 'audio', 'restorations', 'would', 'offer', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'movie', 'when', 'received', 'Amazon', 'yesterday', 'day', 'release', 'watched', 'entirety', 'last', 'evening', 'video', 'quality', 'truly', 'excellent', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'poor', 'quality', 'DTS', 'audio', 'order', 'get', 'sub-woofer', 'kick', 'had', 'boost', 'volume', 'level', 'substantially', 'higher', 'range', 'normally', 'use', 'Admittedly', 'dialogue', 'intense', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'will', 'be', 'going', 'sub', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'punch', 'when', 'drama', 'emphasis', 'music', 'score', 'kicks', 'when', 'watching', 'sound', 'intense', 'action', 'scenes', 'have', 'yet', 'experience', 'audio', 'issue', 'other', 'DTS', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'collection', 'collection', 'very', 'new', 'latest', 'technology', 'movies', 'select', 'older', 'classic', 'movies', 'such', 'Dr.', 'Zhivago.Overall', 'movie', 'theatrical', 'experience', 'improved', 'age', 'continue', 'rate', 'movie', '5', 'Star', 'production', 'including', 'wonderful', 'music', 'score', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'subject', 'matter', 'become', 'more', 'relevant', 'when', 'played', 'backdrop', 'today', 'political', 'events', 'So', 'sum', 'up', 'here', 'review', 'intended', 'Blu-Ray', 'Book', 'Edition', 'movie', '3', 'Star', 'rating', 'based', 'solely', 'poor', 'quality', 'Blu-Ray', 'DTS', 'audio', 'very', 'much', 'promised', 'come', 'restored']",Doctor Zhivago VHS

381428,A5ZUZ49YRDPCV,6303599109,Rachel Garret,"[5, 6]","1965: Doctor Zhivago won numerous Oscars ands swept audiences with its lush cinematography, superb drama, graphic historic portrayal of Russia during the 1918 revolution and its sublime romanticism. It was precisely for its frank depiction of the Russian Revolution, and rise of Communism, that Russian writer Boris Pasternak was censored by Russian critics. For years his novel and his poetry were banned. By 1965, Pasternak's novel and poetry was published and Doctor Zhivago was made into a stunning film. It starred Omar Shariff as the eponymous doctor, Geraldine Chaplin as his wife, Julie Christie as his mistress, and Alec Guiness as a military detective. The musical score to the film was composed by Maurice Jarre. Doctor Zhivago is right up there with such romantic epics as Gone With The Wind and Titanic, most recently. It is an engaging and poetic tale of raw human emotion.The film begins in the last days of glittering, Imperial Russia. Doctor Zhivago is a brilliant doctor by profession and practice, a romantic poet by heart. He is married to Tonya, who gives birth to his first born son, Zasha. Julie Christie portrays Lara, the young woman who escapes an abusive relationship with a cruel older man and ends up as a nurse during the war. Here, she meets Doctor Zhivago and they fall in love. Adultery and extramarital relationships have been romanticized by films and literature before. It is not to be judged harshly, for romantic love comes in all forms. In the case of Doctor Zhivago, Lara becomes a source of inspiration and a lasting love. He does not, however, turn away his love for his wife, Tonya. In fact, if you take a good look at the film (or perhaps read the novel in my perspective), you will discover that Zhivago loves two women equally. He is in love with both his wife and his mistress. It is one of the most romantic tales of adultery, or for that matter, polyamorous romance. There is an impressive scene in which Zhivago, lost and wandering a landscape covered in snow during a storm, calls out to both Tonya and Lara, as he believes he is dying. The idea is that, if one is at the verge of death, loved ones come to mind.The Impressionist style of cinematography helps to fuel the romanticism, especially striking are the landscapes of rural Russia in the winter and the spring. The shot with Zhivago looking at the field of sunflowers is particularily memorable. After the hardship and terror of war, in a vein similar to Gone With The Wind, Zhivago manages to keep himself, his wife and his child alive. Lara gives birth to a daughter by Zhivago, a young woman who later grows up without knowing the story of her father's romance with Lara. Zhivago dies, but saves the two women he loves from immediate danger. When his daughter by Lara begins to wonder about her father, Alec Guiness investigates through rummaging photoprahps and Zhivago's poetry, which, most suspect are dedicated to Lara, but I personally believe he was writing to both women, and in short, praising the power of love. The music is composed by Maurice Jarre, and this film made popular the romantic ""Lara's Theme"" which makes use of string orchestra and balalaika, the Russian folk guitar that Zhivago used to play as a boy and eventually his daughter by Lara learns to play. ""Then it is a gift"" says Alec Guiness as the film concludes.",5,Great Romantic Epics Are Not Made Like This Anymore,1045353600,"02 16, 2003",2003,3351,"['1965', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'won', 'numerous', 'Oscars', 'swept', 'audiences', 'lush', 'cinematography', 'superb', 'drama', 'graphic', 'historic', 'portrayal', 'Russia', '1918', 'revolution', 'sublime', 'romanticism', 'was', 'precisely', 'frank', 'depiction', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'rise', 'Communism', 'Russian', 'writer', 'Boris', 'Pasternak', 'was', 'censored', 'Russian', 'critics', 'years', 'novel', 'poetry', 'were', 'banned', '1965', 'Pasternak', 'novel', 'poetry', 'was', 'published', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'was', 'made', 'stunning', 'film', 'starred', 'Omar', 'Shariff', 'eponymous', 'doctor', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin', 'wife', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'mistress', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'military', 'detective', 'musical', 'score', 'film', 'was', 'composed', 'Maurice', 'Jarre', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'right', 'there', 'such', 'romantic', 'epics', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Titanic', 'most', 'recently', 'engaging', 'poetic', 'tale', 'raw', 'human', 'emotion.The', 'film', 'last', 'days', 'glittering', 'Imperial', 'Russia', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'brilliant', 'doctor', 'profession', 'practice', 'romantic', 'poet', 'heart', 'married', 'Tonya', 'who', 'birth', 'first', 'born', 'son', 'Zasha', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Lara', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'cruel', 'older', 'man', 'up', 'nurse', 'war', 'Here', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'fall', 'love', 'Adultery', 'extramarital', 'relationships', 'have', 'been', 'romanticized', 'films', 'literature', 'not', 'be', 'judged', 'harshly', 'romantic', 'love', 'forms', 'case', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'Lara', 'source', 'inspiration', 'lasting', 'love', 'not', 'however', 'turn', 'away', 'love', 'wife', 'Tonya', 'fact', 'take', 'good', 'look', 'film', 'perhaps', 'read', 'novel', 'perspective', 'will', 'discover', 'Zhivago', 'two', 'women', 'equally', 'love', 'wife', 'mistress', 'one', 'most', 'romantic', 'tales', 'adultery', 'matter', 'polyamorous', 'romance', 'impressive', 'scene', 'Zhivago', 'lost', 'wandering', 'landscape', 'covered', 'snow', 'storm', 'out', 'Tonya', 'Lara', 'dying', 'idea', 'one', 'verge', 'death', 'loved', 'ones', 'come', 'mind.The', 'Impressionist', 'style', 'cinematography', 'fuel', 'romanticism', 'especially', 'striking', 'are', 'landscapes', 'rural', 'Russia', 'winter', 'spring', 'shot', 'Zhivago', 'looking', 'field', 'sunflowers', 'particularily', 'memorable', 'hardship', 'terror', 'war', 'vein', 'similar', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Zhivago', 'keep', 'wife', 'child', 'alive', 'Lara', 'birth', 'daughter', 'Zhivago', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'later', 'up', 'knowing', 'story', 'father', 'romance', 'Lara', 'Zhivago', 'two', 'women', 'immediate', 'danger', 'When', 'daughter', 'Lara', 'wonder', 'father', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'rummaging', 'photoprahps', 'Zhivago', 'poetry', 'most', 'suspect', 'are', 'dedicated', 'Lara', 'personally', 'believe', 'was', 'writing', 'women', 'short', 'praising', 'power', 'love', 'music', 'composed', 'Maurice', 'Jarre', 'film', 'made', 'popular', 'romantic', 'Lara', 'Theme', 'use', 'string', 'orchestra', 'balalaika', 'Russian', 'folk', 'guitar', 'Zhivago', 'used', 'play', 'boy', 'eventually', 'daughter', 'Lara', 'learns', 'play', 'Then', 'gift', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'film', 'concludes']",Doctor Zhivago VHS

I was amazed by how the movie followed the book.  There were rarely passages in the book that didn't immediately bring to mind a visual picture of what I had already seen.  In ""Doctor Zhivago"" David Lean appears to have intended to honor the novel (by Boris Pasternak) by bringing it to the screen in as complete and accurate a manner as possible.  His success in this has, to me, helped to make the movie as great as it is. ""Dr. Zhivago"" won Boris Pasternak the Nobel Prize for Literature and it succeeded in winning Robert Bolt the Academy Award for Best Writing.  Bolt is certainly a great one for screenplays (consider ""A Man for All Seasons"") but I can't help but feel he had a head start when taking on this project.""Doctor Zhivago"" is an epic movie and the word that comes to mind in describing it is MAGNITUDE.  This story is, first and foremost, a love story and a sad one at that.  The sadness is in what might have been.  However, it may be hard for some to keep track of the story while great events in history come to life on the screen.  We see the 1905 revolution, WWI, the Russian Revolution, the ensuing Civil War just to name the major points.  Throughout it all, we have just enough characters to give us an understanding of the class system that determined how these events would turn out.  One of the major roles, and, in my opinion, the best acted role, was that of Doctor Zhivago's step brother (played by Alec Guinness).  He serves the role of counter-balancing the upper-class attitudes of the title character (played adequately by Omar Sharif).  Another important role was Strenlikov, the Trotsky-like figure played by Tom Courtney who garnered an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his fine performance.  He brought out the dark side of the Bolsheviks while showing a repressed humane nature of his own.  There are many excellent performances including that of Julie Christie who won the Best Actress Oscar that year but for a different movie (""Darling"").The scenery and the costumes and the battle scenes were all outstanding.  The Directing, however, is what I credit with making the movie as great as it is.  David Lean may spend a lot of his producer's money but he always makes it appear like money well spent.  Thank goodness a project like this one was put in his capable hands.  In the nearly 40 years since this movie came out, at least two generations may have missed seeing it.  Hopefully, the films buffs of today will take the time to see what a real epic movie is all about.  The novel ""Doctor Zhivago"" was a timeless classic.

I had never seen this film before, and sat down to view it with absolutely NO preconceptions or knowlege beyond that it was a 'really famous movie about people living at the time of the Russian Revolution.""4 hours later (allowing for some locking up of the scratched library copy I viewed) ... I slapped myself awake and went off to get a snack.My reviews will pretty much echo most of the other 2-3 star ones.It's a very pretty film.  The cast is attractive, the cinematography lush, the sets well done.  (But the cast may be a bit TOO attractive. I found it very hard to swallow the image of Geraldine Chaplin looking like she's just stepped out of the local beauty parlor after spending 2 weeks in a cattle car with 49 other unwashed people!)But pretty will only take you so far.  The script and direction waver between utterly confusing and utterly boring and utterly unbelievable.  The minor characters are almost all two-dimensional ciphers. (The evil Bolsheviks ... very cold-war indeed.)  And the major ones are mostly unlikeable and uninteresting.  I couldn't really care about either Zhivago OR Lara.  Why should I root for their star-crossed love affair? Why should I LIKE this man who is cheating on his pregnant wife for no apparent reason. If they were able to resist their attraction/temptation while working together for 6 months in an isolated army hospital, why couldn't they resist when they met again ... 5 miles away from Zhivago's pregnant wife and beloved son?The only really interesting characters were the few 3 dimensional ones -- Alec Guiness, Geraldine Chaplin and Rod Steiger's characters. (The last of whom is at least SUPPOSED to be unlikeable.)At 2 hours this might have been a tolerable chick-flick.

The bitterly cold landscape of Russia in the winter contrasts sharply with the fires burning within the characters. Omar Sharif and Julie Christie are magic together. The snowy scenes and sweeping scenery display an unequaled knowledge of cinematography. The popular music is instantly recognizable and winds its way through the movie, making the score all the more emotive.Every scene in this movie feels real. Omar Sharif and Julie Christie along with the rest of the cast, make this movie so believable, you forget you are watching a movie. You enter their world and become fascinated with their lives. Yuri (Omar Sharif/Dr. Zhivago) is the main character and the story revolves around his passion for Lara (Julie Christie). Through the harsh realities of life during at the time, their lives seem eternally intertwined. Pasha (Tom Courtenay) plays Lara's political activist husband. Victor, an older gentleman, also has a passion for Lara. She is pursued by three men, but only loved by one. These three men, their stories, and the lives of their families fill out the story line in the movie.The story begins when Dr. Zhivago's brother finds his niece (the daughter of Dr. Zhivago who is a writer/doctor/poet and Lara who becomes the love of his life). The scenes then flash back to the Revolution in Russia. As Red blood spills out onto the white snow, we also see two people needing each other perhaps more then their very life blood. Their desire is only fueled by the fires of the Revolution as they continue to have their lives intertwine in an almost sadistic way. They seem drawn to each other by a magnetic force of passion.This is story telling at it's finest. Just remember, it is a story and is not meant to revolutionize your thinking on the sanctity of marriage. In desperation to just survive, the characters make many bad judgments. It makes a great story, but is a sad look at character. It is definitely one of the most romantic movies ever made. It will hold your attention for hours and at the end, you will wish it had been a longer movie.You will love this movie and do look for the Christmas Tree with real candles. I also felt this movie truly brought history to life in a way no book could. Enter the snowy streets of Moscow and be amazed at the ice house in the country. The writers expected the viewer to fill in a few gaps with their own imagination, which makes this movie all the more enjoyable as you are not taken though endless visions of tedium. No moment is wasted.

381436,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6303599109,Reviewer,"[3, 5]","Within the heart and mind of the true poet resides a grasp and perception of life and the human condition unequaled in it's purity by any other art form.  From Rimbaud to Frost to Jim Morrison, he will in a few words or lines create or recreate an experience, thereby enabling his audience to know that experience, as well, albeit vicariously.  The poet, of course, will choose the medium through which he will share his vision.  For director David Lean, that medium is the cinema; and with ""Doctor Zhivago,"" a film of sweeping and poetic grandeur, he reveals that within, he harbors the heart and soul of the poet.  Indisputably, this is the true nature of David Lean; and it is evident in every frame of this film from the beginning to end.To borrow a line from the more recent ""Moulin Rouge,"" this is a story bout ""love.""  A love story set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution.  Dr. Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) is a general practitioner, but he is also a poet; through his vocation as a man of medicine, he tends to those in need in everyday real life.  But it is through his avocation as a poet that he expresses what he sees.  He marries Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) and has children; but the War and revolution intervene, and it is during these tumultuous times that his life becomes inexorably intertwined with a government official, Komarovsky (Rod Steiger), a young revolutionary, Pasha (Tom Courtenay), his half-brother, Yevgraf (Alec Guinness), and finally, Lara (Julie Christie).  It's desperate times for Russians from all walks of life, and Zhivago does what he can to do what he can to keep the fragile threads of his life-- and of those around him-- intact.  But fate plays a hand, and in the end, even Zhivago must go where Destiny leads.With ""Zhivago,"" David Lean has crafted and delivered a magnificent and monumental motion picture of epic proportions that at the same time is disarmingly intimate, rendered as a world within a world, with each a vital part of the other.  Lean blends actors, cinematography, story and music with his own compassionate perspective to create a true work of art; a work of true poetry.  In telling his story, he offers breathtaking visuals, like the awesome vistas of the snow-covered Urals, or a long shot of a wide open Russian plain with a solitary figure in the distance trudging through the snow, juxtaposed against the enormity of the landscape.Often, however, what he doesn't show you, but suggests, is even more effective and emotionally stirring.  Consider the scene in which a complement of mounted dragoons, sabres drawn, ride down upon a crowd peacefully demonstrating in the city streets; Lean sets it up so that you understand what is about to happen, then trains his camera on Zhivago, watching from a balcony overlooking the street as the carnage unfolds below.  And in Zhivago's eyes, in the expression on his face, in his reaction to what he is witnessing, there is more horror because of what Lean has established in your imagination-- and which significantly enhances the impact of it-- than anything the most graphic visual depiction could have produced.  Similarly, when the Czar and his whole family are shot, Lean does not take you there; instead, you learn of it and realize the impact of it through the reaction of Alexander Gromeko (Ralph Richardson), Tonya's father, and it places it into a context that makes it all the more effective.  This is filmmaking at it's best, and an example of what makes Lean's films so memorable.Put a talented actor into the hands of a gifted director, and results of more than some distinction can be expected; and such is the case with Omar Sharif and David Lean.  In 1962, Sharif received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his work in Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" and in ""Zhivago,"" Lean's next film, Sharif gives a sensitive, affecting performance for which he should have received a Best Actor nomination, but inexplicably, did not (It was Lee Marvin's year for ""Cat Ballou"").  Still, as Yuri Zhivago, he has never been better.  Sharif successfully manages to convey his deepest, internalized emotions, expressing them through the genuine compassion with which he imbues his character.  Lean allows his star the time he needs to share with his audience his appreciation of the beauty he perceives in the world around him, and it's in those pensive moments that we, in turn, perceive the inner beauty and poetic nature of the man.  You have but to look into Zhivago's eyes to know his sense of joy in all living things.  It's a wonderful collaboration between actor and director that so vividly and poignantly brings this character to life.1965 was a career year for Julie Christie; she received the Oscar for Best Actress for her work in ""Darling,"" yet in this film created an even more enduring and memorable character in Lara (aided in no small part by the hauntingly lovely ""Lara's Theme,"" by Maurice Jarre, which indelibly etched Christie/Lara in the consciousness of ""Zhivago's vast, international audience).  Lara's beauty is obvious, yet of a kind that goes much deeper than what you see on the surface; her station in life has made her vulnerable to misuse, but at the same time has endowed her with a strength born of necessity.  And Zhivago sees in her a quality and a resourcefulness that fulfills his romantic notions of perfection, and with a beguiling screen presence and a performance to match, Christie makes those notions credible and believable.Guinness, Richardson and Courtenay are exceptional in their respective roles-- Lean without question knows how to get the best out of his actors-- and also turning in noteworthy performances are Siobhan McKenna (Anna), Rita Tushingham (The Girl) and Klaus Kinski, who is unforgettable as Kostoyed, manacled and designated for forced labor, yet the ""Freest man on this train!""

Much of the movie will seem new if it is more than a few years since it has been viewed.The fame of the movie is well documented as evidenced by the 5 Oscars and 25 other Nominations and Awards it attracted, so there is hardly a need to dwell on its significance in motion picture history.What remains to be said however is to be reminded of how smoothly the film portrays the complex relationships. How can a man,Omar Sharif, love two women, (Julie Christie and Geraldine Chaplin)?How can these two women accommodate each other with empathy and understanding?  The movie provides no answers and very few clues.  Viewers will need to work out their own explanations.Indeed the movie is a study of relationships - between lovers, men,families, and politically opposed forces.  All struggling for solutions,interspersed with periods of love and happiness that prove to be temporary.Author Pasternak created a stark relationship that endured to the end of the film.  Rod Steiger, as Komarovsky,pressured Julie Christie,as the teenager, Lara Atipova, into a sexual relationship.  The complexity included Steiger having Christie's mother as his mistress. Pasternak wrote his book prior to 1973 and was not to know the term, 'The Stockholm Syndrome' but here we have it on display between Steiger and Christie. It has been elsewhere described as The Mystery of Loving an Abuser.  Julie Christie may not have loved Steiger in the usual sense but in the film she clearly was sometimes co-operatative, if not tender.  In any event it is there to see, a Controlling and Intimidating Relationship.  Perhaps what we see in Christie's behaviour is a survival strategy.Relationships between these two, and others, are thrown up on the screen frequently and ensure that viewers are constantly engagedJulie Christie was one of several stars in Dr Zhivago.  Tom Courtenay also stars and plays the part of a political activist in this movie and marries Julie Christie (Lara).  This was not their first film together.  The were teamed up in ""Billy Liar"" in 1973.Julie Christie was busy in 1965 when Doctor Zhivago was made.  She starred in 'Darling' also made in 1965, and also received the Academy Award for Best Actress.  'Darling' is also available through Amazon.

381443,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,6303599109,Robert J. Crawford,"[1, 2]","I had not seen this film in 30 years but remembered it vividly.  Seeing it now, it truly met the test of excellence for me:  the love story, the grand sweep of history, the soul of a poet.  It all rang true for me, indeed was unbearably beautiful, perhaps because it brought back the emotions I felt as a child seeing this and then as an adolescent in crisis.  I think this is a film you can watch at each stage of life and see new things, a true mark of great art.The one thing that I did not remember so clearly was the brutally adult themes of how people can get used by opportunists with a little bit of power, i.e. the seduction and rape of Lara.  That is so raw that I am not sure I want my children to watch it.  I also barely recalled the orphaned daughter, whose performance brought tears to my eyes.Sure, this is romantic, but I would never say melodramatic in spite of the awkward and unbelievable coincidences that crop up regularly.  Shariff is wonderful, with so much going on below the surface that his performance is extremely subtle.  Christie, an unconventional beauty, is wonderful as the chaotic Lara, reflecting a tumult of emotion and personal trouble.  Guiness was also great as a revolutionary turned bureaucrat, though I would have liked the story behind his separation from Zhivago to have been explained.  The cameo by Kinski was also memorable.Recommended with enthusiasm.",5,"romantic yes, but this succeeds on every level, at least for me",1286496000,"10 8, 2010",2010,1400,"['had', 'not', 'seen', 'film', '30', 'years', 'remembered', 'vividly', 'Seeing', 'now', 'truly', 'met', 'test', 'excellence', 'love', 'story', 'grand', 'sweep', 'history', 'soul', 'poet', 'true', 'indeed', 'was', 'unbearably', 'beautiful', 'perhaps', 'brought', 'back', 'emotions', 'felt', 'child', 'seeing', 'then', 'adolescent', 'crisis', 'think', 'film', 'can', 'watch', 'stage', 'life', 'see', 'new', 'things', 'true', 'mark', 'great', 'art.The', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'remember', 'so', 'clearly', 'was', 'brutally', 'adult', 'themes', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'get', 'used', 'opportunists', 'little', 'bit', 'power', 'i.e', 'seduction', 'rape', 'Lara', 'so', 'raw', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'want', 'children', 'watch', 'also', 'barely', 'recalled', 'orphaned', 'daughter', 'performance', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes.Sure', 'romantic', 'would', 'never', 'say', 'melodramatic', 'spite', 'awkward', 'unbelievable', 'coincidences', 'crop', 'up', 'regularly', 'Shariff', 'wonderful', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'surface', 'performance', 'extremely', 'subtle', 'Christie', 'unconventional', 'beauty', 'wonderful', 'chaotic', 'Lara', 'reflecting', 'tumult', 'emotion', 'personal', 'trouble', 'Guiness', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'revolutionary', 'turned', 'bureaucrat', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'story', 'separation', 'Zhivago', 'have', 'been', 'explained', 'cameo', 'Kinski', 'was', 'also', 'memorable.Recommended', 'enthusiasm']",Doctor Zhivago VHS

381445,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6303599109,Robert Morris,"[5, 7]","It has been almost 40 years since Doctor Zhivago lost out to The Sound of Music for the Academy Award as best film. If you think that is ludicrous (I certainly do), consider the fact that thirteen years earlier, High Noon, Moulin Rouge, and The Quiet Man lost out to The Greatest Show on Earth for the Academy Award as best film in 1952. (Ivanhoe was also bypassed and, in my opinion, did not even deserve to be nominated.) Today, however, Doctor Zhivago is considered a great film...which it assuredly is. Based on Boris Pasternak's novel and directed by David Lean, it traces the life and experiences of a doctor and poet portrayed by Tarek Sharif as a child and then by Omar Sharif as an adult. Zhivago and his family become caught up in and almost consumed by the Russian Revolution.His half-brother Yevgraf (Alec Guinness) provides an especially effective voice over to clarify the narrative at various points; also, Yevgraf silently intervenes in Zhivago's life when such assistance is most needed. By then, Yevgraf is a high-ranking government official who recognizes that his half-brother is a great poet whose heart is pure. He may also consider him to be somewhat naive and therefore vulnerable. Lean makes brilliant use of the omniscient voice-over to begin and end the film, of course, but also to advance the plot with style and grace.Those who hold this film in such high regard have reasons of their own for doing so. Mine include a series of juxtapositions. For example, spectacular rural landscapes juxtaposed with moments of exquisite tenderness; Zhivago's essential goodness with the self-serving behavior of other characters such as Komarovsky (Rod Steiger); the innocence of young Strelnikoff (Tom Courtney) with his brutal treatment of adversaries both during and following the revolution; and finally, the conflict between Zhivago's sense of obligation to his wife (Tonya) with his passion for Lara (Julie Christie). Yes, this is among the greatest of epic films but many of its memorable moments involve intensely human, indeed intimate interaction as when Zhivago and Lara are alone in the ""ice house.""Whenever I hear ""Lara's Theme,"" I immediately think of Julie Christie as Lara. I also envision the vast Russian countryside, magnificent in each of the four seasons, impervious to centuries of man's inhumanity to man. If for only 197 minutes, this film enables us to experience (albeit vicariously) much of a great and good man's life long ago in a distant land. While doing so, our own lives are nourished and enriched.

381446,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,6303599109,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[6, 8]","""Doctor Zhivago"" tells a simple love story in a turbulent setting and, for the most part, avoids easy resolutions to disordered emotional relationships... Even though the focus is openly on those relationships, everything in the film recurs around the general destructive effects of the Russian Revolution... The irrational actions of both World War I and the prolonged struggles among the various Bolshevik factions are the driving forces behind the tragic plot...In adapting Boris Pasternak's novel to the screen, writer Robert Bolt tells the story in flashback, with the powerful Gen. Yevgraf Zhivago (Alec Guinness) questioning a teenaged girl (Rita Tushingham) about her past... He thinks she might be the daughter of his brother Yuri (Omar Sharif), the dreamy poet-physician and Lara (Julie Christie), the love of his life...Flashback to their youth and the first time that Yuri and Lara's paths cross on a streetcar... He's a promising, successful medical student and poet, engaged to his childhood sweetheart Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin). Lara is the daughter of a dressmaker who has a long-term ""arrangement"" with Victor Komarovsky (Rod Steiger), a political chameleon who comes out on top no matter who is in power... Lara's fianc&eacute; Pasha (Tom Courtenay) is an idealistic revolutionary who is part of that change... Komarovsky's interest in Lara is not platonic...As those relationships are being selected, protesters are marching in the streets and the Czar's troopers are taking them seriously... In the first big confrontation between a demonstration and a cavalry charge on snow-covered streets, Lean avoids the inevitable comparisons to Sergei Eisenstein's Odessa steps scene in ""The Battleship Potemkin,"" but he can't he1p but make a few references to it... The clash in the streets also serves as a counterpoint to Komarovsky's seduction of Lara, and the two elements are cleverly interwoven... The combination of the personal and the political has rarely been so striking as it is in that effective sequence...The most memorable scenes, however, take place during World War I and the revolution: a mass of deserters meets a mass of replacement troops on a lonely road; Yuri and family embark on a long severe rail journey from Moscow to the Urals and negotiate territory controlled at times by Red Guards and at times by White Guards; a machine gun attack on an unseen enemy across a field; Yuri's being harried into service and then his long trek back home through the snow...Lean gives the film an impression of stark, beautiful expanse... Like all love stories, ""Doctor Zhivago"" depends on viewers' involvement with the characters, and these work very well... While Lara is the effective expression of the pain and chaos of those cataclysmic times, Yury can see no happiness in his existence without the love of this beautiful woman, which to him is immortal...

The story is powerful, the actors excellent, the editing appropriate, the sound track wonderful and the cinematography breathtaking.Even the scene in which the child Zhivago's mother is buried on a bitter Winter day is fabulous.  We are actually permitted into the coffin of the beautiful young woman as her orphaned child watches ice crystals forming on his window.  Unique, powerful and breathtaking. It's all breathtaking.Zhivago sees beauty where others see only grief and ugliness.  He tries to understand when his family home is subdivided and administered by tight-lipped Communists hacks.  Personally apolitical, Zhivago is a witness and victim of the political events of his time.  He serves as a physician in the crumbling Russian army; he's a witness to the revolutionary collapse of an army and old Russia; he and his farmily travel in a cattle car to the now-Soviet East, hoping to find food and a little peace.  It doesn't happen.  He encounters Strelnikov, a Communist fanatic, butcher and old acquaintance.  He betrays his wife and falls hopelessly in love with the beautiful Lara.Idealistic and moral, he tries to control himself and tells the tearful Lara that they must never meet again.  Too late.  On the way back to his dutiful wife he is captured by the Red Guards and forced to become their physician.  He has no love for the Communists but he treats the sick and wounded.  In the midst of a terrible Winter he deserts in a futile effort to find his family.What ultimately happens to Lara?  We never find out.  A Communist officer cynically speculates, ""She was probably one of the millions who ""disppeared"" and were sent to Sibera, her name on a list, later misplaced.""An interesting aside is that I personally became acquainted with a very old man who had a history remarkably similar to the mythical Zhivago.  He was a Russian physician who joined the anti-Communist ""White Guards.""  The anti-Communist forces were pushed further and further East toward Vladivostock. When this port city fell, he and other Russians fled to Harbin, Manchuria.  His son, Alex, was born in Harbin but, following the Japanese invasion, came to the U.S. It was through Alex that I got to know the old man.

381457,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,6303599109,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""","[5, 6]","Romance. We are drawn to it with its profound beauty and we cannot escape its pull. When a good romance, tragic or happy, is played out on the screen, and when its score has beautiful music, and when there is much to see and discuss about the film's look and historic detail, that's when you know it's a classic. I like to think of romantic films as a trinity with other romantic films under its three deities. The first film in the trinity is Gone With The Wind, the second is Doctor Zhivago and the third is Titanic. Doctor Zhivago was filmed in the mid 60's, Pasternak had written the Russian novel years before. The story is set against the wake of the WWI Revolution in which the entire nation of the once Imperial Russia fell to Communism. Doctor Zhivago ( the sexy Omar Shariff) is a well-to-do doctor who lives with a Victorian, obedient and boring wife (played by Geraldine Chaplin) and has always secretly loved (or lusted) after Lara, who becomes his mistress and later the source of poetry and mystery in the film. As war breaks out, Zhivago joins the front as an surgeon, where he meets Lara working as a nurse. After the war and as Communists have seized Russia, Lara's, now with child, husband a lieutenant, is no where to be found and is possibly turned Communist himself. When Zhivago, his wife (who is expecting a child), Lara and her daughter move out into the countryside, the affair between Zhivago and Lara begins. This is the most romanticized adultery ever made. Why ? There has been others you say...Lancelot and Guenevere, Hester Prynne and Dimsdale in the Scarlet Letter. But the Doctor Zhivago/Lara romance is interesting because, although no one really knows it and perhaps it is merely my own interpretation, Zhivago loves Lara and his wife equally. OF course, the focus is the illicit affair, as is expected in all adultery-related films and novels, but Zhivago becomes a true romantic when we discover how deeply he feels for both women. During the snowstorm, he is nearly dying and he calls out for his wife and for Lara, just as any one would cry out for their loved ones when they die. He writes romantic poetry and letters to a mysterious someone, and we always conclude that it is Lara. Perhaps it is. Perhaps it is his wife. Perhaps both women. Perhaps its neither and he is writing to Love, universal, eternal, divine. The music is sweeping, lush and carries out the action and romance very effectively. The imagery is also very appealing, especially the scenes in which a contemplative Zhivago looks over a thick forest off the train and is intoxicated with a sort of Impressionist reverie, and the same applies to Zhivago looking at the field of yellow daffodils, which any Impressionist artist would have loved to depict in their art. The score by Maurice Jarre is impressive, brilliantly orchestrated and elegant, especially striking is the Russian and Romantic Era Tchaikovsky-esque flavor of Lara's Theme. The balalaika, a stringed Russian guitar, is heard often enough and becomes the gift that Zhivago's daughter by Lara takes with her at the end of the novel, and symbolically, the gift of love, sacrifice (which Zhivago does himself for BOTH his women) and creativity and romance that must be passed to every person now and forever.",5,A Romantic Masterpiece,1031443200,"09 8, 2002",2002,3281,"['Romance', 'are', 'drawn', 'profound', 'beauty', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'pull', 'When', 'good', 'romance', 'tragic', 'happy', 'played', 'out', 'screen', 'when', 'score', 'beautiful', 'music', 'when', 'much', 'see', 'discuss', 'film', 'look', 'historic', 'detail', 'when', 'know', 'classic', 'like', 'think', 'romantic', 'films', 'trinity', 'other', 'romantic', 'films', 'three', 'deities', 'first', 'film', 'trinity', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'second', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'third', 'Titanic', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'was', 'filmed', 'mid', '60', 'Pasternak', 'had', 'written', 'Russian', 'novel', 'years', 'story', 'set', 'wake', 'WWI', 'Revolution', 'entire', 'nation', 'once', 'Imperial', 'Russia', 'fell', 'Communism', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'sexy', 'Omar', 'Shariff', 'well-to-do', 'doctor', 'who', 'Victorian', 'obedient', 'boring', 'wife', 'played', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin', 'always', 'secretly', 'loved', 'lusted', 'Lara', 'who', 'mistress', 'later', 'source', 'poetry', 'mystery', 'film', 'war', 'breaks', 'out', 'Zhivago', 'front', 'surgeon', 'where', 'Lara', 'working', 'nurse', 'war', 'Communists', 'have', 'seized', 'Russia', 'Lara', 'now', 'child', 'husband', 'lieutenant', 'where', 'be', 'found', 'possibly', 'turned', 'Communist', 'When', 'Zhivago', 'wife', 'who', 'expecting', 'child', 'Lara', 'daughter', 'move', 'out', 'countryside', 'affair', 'Zhivago', 'Lara', 'most', 'romanticized', 'adultery', 'ever', 'made', 'Why', 'been', 'others', 'say', 'Lancelot', 'Guenevere', 'Hester', 'Prynne', 'Dimsdale', 'Scarlet', 'Letter', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago/Lara', 'romance', 'interesting', 'because', 'one', 'really', 'perhaps', 'merely', 'own', 'interpretation', 'Zhivago', 'Lara', 'wife', 'equally', 'OF', 'course', 'focus', 'illicit', 'affair', 'expected', 'adultery-related', 'films', 'novels', 'Zhivago', 'true', 'romantic', 'when', 'discover', 'how', 'deeply', 'women', 'snowstorm', 'nearly', 'dying', 'out', 'wife', 'Lara', 'just', 'one', 'would', 'cry', 'out', 'loved', 'ones', 'when', 'die', 'romantic', 'poetry', 'letters', 'mysterious', 'someone', 'always', 'conclude', 'Lara', 'Perhaps', 'Perhaps', 'wife', 'Perhaps', 'women', 'Perhaps', 'neither', 'writing', 'Love', 'universal', 'eternal', 'divine', 'music', 'sweeping', 'lush', 'out', 'action', 'romance', 'very', 'effectively', 'imagery', 'also', 'very', 'appealing', 'especially', 'scenes', 'contemplative', 'Zhivago', 'thick', 'forest', 'train', 'intoxicated', 'sort', 'Impressionist', 'reverie', 'same', 'applies', 'Zhivago', 'looking', 'field', 'yellow', 'daffodils', 'Impressionist', 'artist', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'depict', 'art', 'score', 'Maurice', 'Jarre', 'impressive', 'brilliantly', 'orchestrated', 'elegant', 'especially', 'striking', 'Russian', 'Romantic', 'Era', 'Tchaikovsky-esque', 'flavor', 'Lara', 'Theme', 'balalaika', 'stringed', 'Russian', 'guitar', 'heard', 'often', 'enough', 'gift', 'Zhivago', 'daughter', 'Lara', 'end', 'novel', 'symbolically', 'gift', 'love', 'sacrifice', 'Zhivago', 'BOTH', 'women', 'creativity', 'romance', 'must', 'be', 'passed', 'person', 'now', 'forever']",Doctor Zhivago VHS
381458,A2SM64C79TS70F,6303599109,Russell W. Carrington,"[4, 5]","Doctor Zhivago is without a doubt an amazing accomplishment.  It successfully, for the most part, takes the microcosm of several relationships and places it in the macrocosm of the Russian Revolution.  The moments of snowy peace and love, protected from the turbulance of the outside world, create many striking images.The movie is not without its weaknesses, however.  These characters, small and insignificant as they are amidst the social turmoil, keep having amazing coincidences.  I wish I could be so lucky as to take a train to Siberia or wherever, meet a leader of the revolution during a toilet break, get back to the train just as its leaving, and end up residing a few miles from the revolution leader's wife, who just happens to be my mistress and the most beautiful woman in the country.  Thank goodness for that toilet break.  The revolution leader got to tell me exactly where his wife was residing!There is simply not enought dialogue and character development to believe the characters are who the movie says they are. Doctor Zhivago is the sensitive poet, we know, because he's always staring at things while sensitive music plays.  He and Lara love each other deeply, we're supposed to believe, because, well, they're darn attractive people.  But why else?

However, all the disparate parts never coalesced for me into a unified whole. The film plods along at a glacial place, and for the majority of it we only have Zhivago to guide us through it. He himself is a noble man of character, but in terms of the narrative he just isn't interesting enough to carry such a big picture. Omar Sharif plays him as intelligent, dedicated, and kind, but there just isn't enough drama in how the revolution is impacting him to keep the story afloat. This may also be the fault of the screenwriter; long, languorous scenes follow one after the other, each doing nil to further the plot but rather working as set pieces to show off the film's handsome production values in the hope of impressing its audience with style over substance (which it obviously succeeded at). It felt to me as if David Lean set out to make a gigantic epic, and relied too heavily on the tenets of the genre at the expense of giving the film a real heart. Even the Zhivago-Lara romance, featured so heavily in any publicity for the film, is hurried, unconvincing, and introduced far too late in the film. However, history has been kind to the film, and it makes for good (not great) viewing today partly because it is such a piece of the 1960's zeitgeist. The character of Zhivago, while almost dull, is also a nuanced metaphor for the state of Russia as it went through the revolution, and makes for interesting analysis.

The best scenes, and most of the film, actually take place during the Russian Civil War of the early 1920's, a period most Westerners, mainly Americans, may not be familiar with. After the Revolution, the Reds and Whites battled it out some more in some of the bloodiest battles of the century. It is historically accurate with the Reds riding around in their armored trains, machine guns at the ready, producing such horrors as the massacre of the boys dressed in white in the snow. The love stories all the way through, and Zhivago's exile are true, based on the autobiographical novel, and the winter scenes are fabulous and mesmorizing. Even though it gets a little dragged down in the soap opera aspect, this is without doubt a great historical epic, the specialty of David Lean, among the great British directors. In fact you don't even notice the obvious fact that English is spoken all the way thru in this totally Russia-based  masterpiece. Even the dam, as shown in the end, represents the Soviet industrial might, as it did from the 1930's-50's.

381470,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6303599109,Simon Davis,"[17, 22]","David Lean's masterpiece ""Doctor Zhivago"", is a cinematic journey into the yesteryear world of movie making on a scale of lavishness and grandeur largely unheard of nowadays. With no expense spared on transferring this unforgettable love story to the screen, even now almost 40 years on this film still amazes me with it's sheer artistry and outstanding qualities in every department. I see it as one of the greatest classics to come out of the 1960's combining as it does a perfect marriage of romance, tragedy, human emotion and passion, all set against  the terrifying upheavels of one of the most significant periods in modern history, in this case the Russian Revolution. Such a film as this only comes along rarely.""Doctor Zhivago"", tells its story in a long flashback from the Russia of the 1960's. General Yevgraf Zhivago (Alec Guiness in another superb role), is searching for his half brother's lost child and believes he has found her (Rita Tushingham) at a power plant somewhere in Central Russia. During his examination of her he recalls the story of her possible parents, the idealistic, poetry writing young doctor Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) and the mysterious Lara (Julie Christie), the beautiful girl who won Yuri's heart but who vanished into Stalin's labour camps never to be heard of again. The flashback now takes us back to Pre Revolutionnary Russia where the orphaned Yuri is taken in by the wealthy Gromenko family of Moscow. We see Yuri train to become a successful doctor and eventually marry the Gromenko's lovely daughter Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin in her adult debut). War and revolution however sweep away Yuri's comfortable life as we witness the horrors of the great war and then the outbreak of the Russian Revolution. Working in a military hospital at the front Yuri encounters Lara again who is working as a field nurse and finds himself instantly drawn to her beauty and quiet strength of character. Yuri is torn between his love for Lara and his commitment to Tonya back in Moscow. Peace is declared and the two part company determined to get on with their lives. Yuri however finds that much has changed in his absence from Moscow as the Soviets have seized his home and moved in a large number of factory workers with his family now reduced to living in a couple of rooms of their former home. Starvation and deprevation are the harsh realities of life in Communist Russia and now Yuri encounters his half brother who warns him that the party does not look kindly on his free thinking poetry and have him targeted as an enemy of the new order in Russia. Moving to the country to escape possible persecution Yuri by chance encounters Lara now living on her own in the local town. The two reignite their passion for each other until Yuri is captured by the Red Army and taken away to provide medical assistance to them in the bloody civil war that is now tearing Russia apart. After much hardship he escapes and returns to Lara only to experience the unwelcome reappearance of Lara's old suitor Victor Komarovsky who informs the couple that they are about to be the next targets of the Soviet regime. He offers to take them to safety via the Orient but Yuri, concerned about Lara's safety allows Komarvosky to take her and her daughter on ahead but does not follow thus never seeing her again.""Doctor Zhivago"", is certainly an ambitious effort and one of the high water marks in film making in any decade. It boasts impeccable credits  such as a fine literary source in the classic novel by Boris Pasternack, able direction with obvious reverence for the source material by the gifted David Lean, the hauntingly majestic ""Lara's theme"" by composer Maurice Jarre, and outstanding cinematography by Freddie Young. The superb cast is centred around Omar Sharif ideally cast in the best role of his career. Never has he been better than as the young doctor who is changed forever by war and revolution. Equally outstanding are Julie Christie in the role she is still best remembered for as the enigmatic Lara, Sir Ralph Richardson,brilliant as the long suffering head of the Gromenko family, Geraldine Chaplin as Tonya the ever loving wife of Yuri, and Tom Courtney as the ruthless revolutionary Strelnikov. The beautiful visuals used in this film also help enhance this unforgettable story with the wonderful location photography in Spain standing in for Russian landscapes. The many exciting and beautifully realised sequences in ""Doctor Zhivago"" constantly keep the viewers attention such as the brutal battle scenes in the frozen ice of the Russian Steppes, the frantic train escape from Moscow, and the scenes in the peaceful expances of Siberia with its daffodils and Silver Birch trees. The whole spectrum of violence, terror and beauty are captured in this one story make a viewing of ""Doctor Zhivago"", an awe inspiring journey.Daid Lean displayed a genius in transferring a complex literary work onto the screen and a better screen version of the sprawling novel could not be achieved in my opinion. Every time I hear the hauntingly beautiful ""Lara's Theme"" I'm automatically  transported back to this romantic story set in Russia and to images of daffodils and ice covered houses in the snow. For all lovers of romance ""Doctor Zhivago"", is unsurpassed entertainment of the first order and always manages to stir up all kinds of emotions which each screening.

381471,AJ9W09EUQPAKE,6303599109,Sirin,"[6, 6]","David Lean's 1965 epic has aged well. It is still considered one of the classic achievements of British film nearly 40 years after it's production. What is it all about? The short answer, as Woody Allen summed up 'War and Peace' after taking a speed reading course, is 'Russia'. The film traces the love affair between two Russians, Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) and Lara (Julie Christie). Through Revolution, war, marriage to other partners and exile, the two lovers are consistently blighted every time they feel drawn to each other.The fascination with this film lies in all that it is based on. Boris Pasternak's novel on which Zhivago is based presented a specific view of the Russian Revolution - that of the plight of a bourgeoise Doctor, a man of practical accomplishment but also a sensitive poet. Pasternak himself was a member of the Russian elite and the novel was subsequetly banned by the Communist authorities, holding it to be unsuitable to the socialist cause. The film takes this theme and we are clearly invited to sympathise with Zhivago who has to watch as his large townhouse is divided into flats for 13 families, contrasting his struggles to remain loyal to his family and his poetry with the cold heartlesness of Strelnikov, the Bolshevik Commissar who burns down villages to 'make the point'. Politics runs through the movie like a leitmotief, certainly Zhivago is popular with British politicians who voted it the greatest ever British film production.The love, war and politics in Zhivago are on an epic scale, and the cinematography supports the vast scope of this movie with superb scenes of the bitter winters in Siberia, the eternal train journeys with escapees of the Revolution piled in to freezing carriages like cattle and the brutal suppressions of protestors by the Russian authorities in the pre-revolutionary years. It is not perfect. Some of the shots of the Urals are not realistic portrayals of the topography of that region, some shots are blatantly of the Canadian Rockies. But this was 1965, and such lapses don't impede the enjoyment of the film.The plot also suffers in places, the inevitable product of a story taken from a novel of subtle complexity and dubious moral expositions (the novel has Zhivago involved with two women other than his wife rather than one). For example the romance between Yuri and Lara reaches catatonic proportions before the fires have been properly stoked. Some viewers may also find the ending rather underwhelming for such a powerful story.These flaws however don't prevent Dr Zhivago from holding a rightful place as one of the classic epics of film, set in one of the most turbulent, violent, disturbing and fascinating periods of Twentieth Century history.",4,It's about Russia,1104019200,"12 26, 2004",2004,2736,"['David', 'Lean', '1965', 'epic', 'aged', 'well', 'still', 'considered', 'one', 'classic', 'achievements', 'British', 'film', 'nearly', '40', 'years', 'production', 'What', 'short', 'answer', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'summed', 'up', ""'War"", 'Peace', 'taking', 'speed', 'reading', 'course', ""'Russia"", 'film', 'love', 'affair', 'two', 'Russians', 'Yuri', 'Zhivago', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'Lara', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Revolution', 'war', 'marriage', 'other', 'partners', 'exile', 'two', 'lovers', 'are', 'consistently', 'blighted', 'time', 'feel', 'drawn', 'other.The', 'fascination', 'film', 'based', 'Boris', 'Pasternak', 'novel', 'Zhivago', 'based', 'presented', 'specific', 'view', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'plight', 'bourgeoise', 'Doctor', 'man', 'practical', 'accomplishment', 'also', 'sensitive', 'poet', 'Pasternak', 'was', 'member', 'Russian', 'elite', 'novel', 'was', 'subsequetly', 'banned', 'Communist', 'authorities', 'holding', 'be', 'unsuitable', 'socialist', 'cause', 'film', 'theme', 'are', 'clearly', 'invited', 'sympathise', 'Zhivago', 'who', 'watch', 'large', 'townhouse', 'divided', 'flats', '13', 'families', 'contrasting', 'struggles', 'remain', 'loyal', 'family', 'poetry', 'cold', 'heartlesness', 'Strelnikov', 'Bolshevik', 'Commissar', 'who', 'burns', 'down', 'villages', ""'make"", 'point', 'Politics', 'movie', 'leitmotief', 'certainly', 'Zhivago', 'popular', 'British', 'politicians', 'who', 'voted', 'greatest', 'ever', 'British', 'film', 'production.The', 'love', 'war', 'politics', 'Zhivago', 'are', 'epic', 'scale', 'cinematography', 'vast', 'scope', 'movie', 'superb', 'scenes', 'bitter', 'winters', 'Siberia', 'eternal', 'train', 'journeys', 'escapees', 'Revolution', 'piled', 'freezing', 'carriages', 'cattle', 'brutal', 'suppressions', 'protestors', 'Russian', 'authorities', 'pre-revolutionary', 'years', 'not', 'perfect', 'shots', 'Urals', 'are', 'not', 'realistic', 'portrayals', 'topography', 'region', 'shots', 'are', 'blatantly', 'Canadian', 'Rockies', 'was', '1965', 'such', 'lapses', 'do', ""n't"", 'impede', 'enjoyment', 'film.The', 'plot', 'also', 'places', 'inevitable', 'product', 'story', 'taken', 'novel', 'subtle', 'complexity', 'dubious', 'moral', 'expositions', 'novel', 'Zhivago', 'involved', 'two', 'women', 'other', 'wife', 'rather', 'one', 'example', 'romance', 'Yuri', 'Lara', 'catatonic', 'proportions', 'fires', 'have', 'been', 'properly', 'stoked', 'viewers', 'may', 'also', 'find', 'ending', 'rather', 'underwhelming', 'such', 'powerful', 'story.These', 'flaws', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'Dr', 'Zhivago', 'holding', 'rightful', 'place', 'one', 'classic', 'epics', 'film', 'set', 'one', 'most', 'turbulent', 'violent', 'disturbing', 'fascinating', 'periods', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'history']",Doctor Zhivago VHS

381476,A27KWLGCORT0US,6303599109,Steamboater,"[5, 6]","Even in the poverty stricken streets of circa 1907 turn-of-the- century Moscow, we mainly see a Russia that's more delectable than what history has revealed. I suppose that's director David Lean's annoyance with the unattractive. Over the years however, I've praised this film as one of my favorites, but as I've gotten older I can see the flaws. The sheer beauty of the sets (especially the snow-filled house in Varykino), color and costumes, and the sweeping soundtrack overwhelmed my sense of the story. There was one scene that was absolutely joyous and that was when Zhivago (Omar Shariff and his fiancee (Geraldine Chaplin) were driving home through snow-covered streets at night in a carriage after a ball and Zhivago sees a candle in one of the upper floors of a building. (In the book, I remember the candle as the one Lara (Julie Christie) put in the window representing the light of love that's soon to come for both of them and as a religious symbol blessing that love.) Zhivago also writes a beautiful poem about it ...""candle, candle, burning bright ..."". I would have liked him to have recited the poem to Lara later on or have Lara find it and read it aloud. In the book, Zhivago's brother, played by Alec Guiness (who looks more like Zhivago's father wearing a terrible dark brown wig that makes him look even older) just shows up one day as he did in the film and then he's gone. Too coincidental in a country the size of Russia and doesn't make any sense. Also, the book had Zhivago involved with 3 women, not 2, but Lean didn't think American audiences would either appreciate a man who was involved with 3 women at the same time or believe it (and American audiences were then at least where the money was). Of course, when books are turned into films so much is left out and as director, it was up to Lean to decide what to omit. In the  book Zhivago had become a street person, ragged and unclean. That's when this third woman takes him in.The worst aspect of the film was its core. We were supposed to have believed that Zhivago and Lara were involved in this simmering romance when in fact we don't even get the chance to see the fires stoked. One day Zhivago sees Lara at the home of her mother. No words are exchanged. The next time he sees her at a ball--no words exchanged then either--and after that (I'm sure) she works with him as a nurse at the front during WWI. There's your passionate love. Lean never allowed for their relationship to flourish. The train also becomes another character and a very important one. These trains become paths of introduction, routes of escape and pathways to death e.g., as a boy, Zhivago is introduced to Moscow after getting off a train, Zhivago's future wife comes home to Moscow by train and he meets her at the railroad station, the family is put into a cattle car and sent east etc.  The best performances are by Steiger and Tom Courtney who as Lara's commissar husband becomes violent, cold, distant and only devoted to the Communist cause. Julie Christie is also very good as Lara, and her scenes with Steiger are the best. Omar Sharif as Zhivago could have shown deeper incite into the role; I suppose that's why he's heavily made up to look like the way he's supposed to feel in many scenes. Geraldine Chaplin as Zhivago's wife is just a prop. She shows no anger, not even sustained sadness. So one day she too disappears and picks herself up and goes to Paris for good. Still, the film is like a beautiful painting with all the music and color one could hope for. The recent PBS version is one you've got see though. It's much better than Lean's version sans sweeping vistas.",4,Russia Never Looked So Good,1099699200,"11 6, 2004",2004,3651,"['Even', 'poverty', 'stricken', 'streets', 'circa', '1907', 'turn-of-the-', 'century', 'Moscow', 'mainly', 'see', 'Russia', 'more', 'delectable', 'what', 'history', 'revealed', 'suppose', 'director', 'David', 'Lean', 'annoyance', 'unattractive', 'years', 'however', ""'ve"", 'praised', 'film', 'one', 'favorites', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'older', 'can', 'see', 'flaws', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'sets', 'especially', 'snow-filled', 'house', 'Varykino', 'color', 'costumes', 'sweeping', 'soundtrack', 'overwhelmed', 'sense', 'story', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'was', 'absolutely', 'joyous', 'was', 'when', 'Zhivago', 'Omar', 'Shariff', 'fiancee', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin', 'were', 'driving', 'home', 'snow-covered', 'streets', 'night', 'carriage', 'ball', 'Zhivago', 'candle', 'one', 'upper', 'floors', 'building', 'book', 'remember', 'candle', 'one', 'Lara', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'put', 'window', 'representing', 'light', 'love', 'soon', 'come', 'religious', 'symbol', 'blessing', 'love', 'Zhivago', 'also', 'beautiful', 'poem', 'candle', 'candle', 'burning', 'bright', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'recited', 'poem', 'Lara', 'later', 'have', 'Lara', 'find', 'read', 'aloud', 'book', 'Zhivago', 'brother', 'played', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'who', 'more', 'Zhivago', 'father', 'wearing', 'terrible', 'dark', 'brown', 'wig', 'look', 'even', 'older', 'just', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'did', 'film', 'then', 'gone', 'Too', 'coincidental', 'country', 'size', 'Russia', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Also', 'book', 'had', 'Zhivago', 'involved', '3', 'women', 'not', '2', 'Lean', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'American', 'audiences', 'would', 'either', 'appreciate', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'involved', '3', 'women', 'same', 'time', 'believe', 'American', 'audiences', 'were', 'then', 'least', 'where', 'money', 'was', 'course', 'when', 'books', 'are', 'turned', 'films', 'so', 'much', 'left', 'out', 'director', 'was', 'up', 'Lean', 'decide', 'what', 'omit', 'book', 'Zhivago', 'had', 'become', 'street', 'person', 'ragged', 'unclean', 'when', 'third', 'woman', 'in.The', 'worst', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'core', 'were', 'supposed', 'have', 'believed', 'Zhivago', 'Lara', 'were', 'involved', 'simmering', 'romance', 'when', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'fires', 'stoked', 'One', 'day', 'Zhivago', 'Lara', 'home', 'mother', 'words', 'are', 'exchanged', 'next', 'time', 'ball', 'words', 'exchanged', 'then', ""'m"", 'sure', 'nurse', 'front', 'WWI', 'passionate', 'love', 'Lean', 'never', 'allowed', 'relationship', 'flourish', 'train', 'also', 'character', 'very', 'important', 'one', 'trains', 'become', 'paths', 'introduction', 'routes', 'escape', 'pathways', 'death', 'e.g.', 'boy', 'Zhivago', 'introduced', 'Moscow', 'getting', 'off', 'train', 'Zhivago', 'future', 'wife', 'home', 'Moscow', 'train', 'railroad', 'station', 'family', 'put', 'cattle', 'car', 'sent', 'east', 'etc', 'best', 'performances', 'are', 'Steiger', 'Tom', 'Courtney', 'who', 'Lara', 'commissar', 'husband', 'violent', 'cold', 'distant', 'only', 'devoted', 'Communist', 'cause', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Lara', 'scenes', 'Steiger', 'are', 'best', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'Zhivago', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'deeper', 'incite', 'role', 'suppose', 'why', 'heavily', 'made', 'up', 'look', 'way', 'supposed', 'feel', 'many', 'scenes', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin', 'Zhivago', 'wife', 'just', 'prop', 'anger', 'not', 'even', 'sustained', 'sadness', 'one', 'day', 'too', 'disappears', 'picks', 'up', 'Paris', 'good', 'Still', 'film', 'beautiful', 'painting', 'music', 'color', 'one', 'could', 'hope', 'recent', 'PBS', 'version', 'one', ""'ve"", 'got', 'see', 'much', 'better', 'Lean', 'version', 'sweeping', 'vistas']",Doctor Zhivago VHS

My wife doesn't like this movie at all as she's often disturbed by the theme of the cheating husband who dotes on some younger, prettier thing, gushes over her in poetry and then abandons his wife and family who stick with him in times of trouble and who actually rescue him as a young child. If this movie is ever on the television when she's home, she either just quietly turns it off or changes the channel. Some people are probably like that though and have little tolerance for the level of tomfoolery that goes on in this movie. To say that the adultery angle is mild in Dr. Zhivago is an understatement. People with faint hearts be warned. Adultery is the soup de jour here.2. As a published poet and someone who has probably lived a life that often rings similar to Yuri Andreivich Zhivago, I am affected by this movie in a different way altogether. It's actually quite haunting. Saying I'm a romantic is another understatement. I've got a romance habit that could burn down concrete buildings. I've also written my fair share of 'Lara Poems', too, but glad that I went through it and have moved on.This movie has been a favourite of mine ever since I was a boy, sitting too close to the television late at night, still awake and watching the Monday Night Movie at 11pm. It meant more to me then than I ever realized and probably etched something within me that made my fate similar to Yuri's. I've never abandoned anyone, so let's get that clear for one, but in other regards it's interesting, or at least to me.Is this review helpful to you?

381482,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,6303599109,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[5, 28]","David Lean's ""Doctor Zhivago"" is the epic that will cure your insomnia.  It suffers from a fatal overdose of melodrama and a running time that will wear down the resolve of even the most resilient filmwatcher.Russian poet-doctor Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) weds Tonya Gromeko (Geraldine Chaplin) but continuously finds himself separated from her because of war.  Into his life enters Lara Antipova (Julie Christie), a woman worn down by her relationships with the politician Viktor Komarovsky (Rod Steiger) and the revolutionary Pasha (Tom Courtenay).  Despite his love for his wife, Yuri cannot deny his passionate feelings for Lara.The production design of ""Doctor Zhivago"" is tremendous and Omar Sharif turns in a magnificent performance as the soulful doctor.  However, these high points are undone by a saccharine love story, an annoying musical score, and Lean's determination to prolong his film as long as possible.  Watching ""Doctor Zhivago"" is such a taxing experience that there should be warning labels attached to all copies of it to alert new viewers of the anguish that awaits them.  A lot of editing and a lot less soap opera moments would have done wonders for ""Doctor Zhivago.""  Lean has been responsible for some terrific films in his career, but this outing is certainly not one of his finer efforts.",2,"""How did you come to be lost?""",1167436800,"12 30, 2006",2006,1319,"['David', 'Lean', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'epic', 'will', 'cure', 'insomnia', 'fatal', 'overdose', 'melodrama', 'running', 'time', 'will', 'wear', 'down', 'resolve', 'even', 'most', 'resilient', 'filmwatcher.Russian', 'poet-doctor', 'Yuri', 'Zhivago', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'Tonya', 'Gromeko', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin', 'continuously', 'separated', 'war', 'Into', 'life', 'enters', 'Lara', 'Antipova', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'woman', 'worn', 'down', 'relationships', 'politician', 'Viktor', 'Komarovsky', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'revolutionary', 'Pasha', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'love', 'wife', 'Yuri', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'passionate', 'feelings', 'Lara.The', 'production', 'design', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'tremendous', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'soulful', 'doctor', 'However', 'high', 'points', 'are', 'undone', 'saccharine', 'love', 'story', 'annoying', 'musical', 'score', 'Lean', 'determination', 'prolong', 'film', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'Watching', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'taxing', 'experience', 'should', 'be', 'warning', 'labels', 'attached', 'copies', 'alert', 'new', 'viewers', 'anguish', 'lot', 'editing', 'lot', 'less', 'soap', 'opera', 'moments', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'wonders', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'Lean', 'been', 'responsible', 'terrific', 'films', 'career', 'outing', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'finer', 'efforts']",Doctor Zhivago VHS

381484,A1K3NQAO49LXL2,6303599109,"Surferofromantica ""S.O.R.""","[0, 0]","This is a review of the Blu-Ray/DVD/CD set of Dr Zhivago, but not of the accompanying book.The Blu-Ray has the great film in full, all 200 minutes of it, as well as documentaries on each half of the film, totaling 40 minutes. The film is, of course, a sweeping fantasy made on a grand scale and no expense spared, with each scene meaningful and well-planned. As such, it's the perfect platform for the great acting of masters like Omar Sharif, Julie Christie, and Rod Steiger. Geraldine Chaplin is also charming as Zhivago's teen love and wife, Tonya, and in her eyes we see the face of her father Charlie Chaplin, wrapped up in a pixyish teenage form. Christie is not quite convincing as a 17-year-old virgin, but is probably better than the original suggestion for the role of Lara&#8230; Sophia Loren! The film goes on and on and on, and each scene is gripping. I want to read the book quite badly, now. Especially effective is Tom Courtenay, as Lara's husband Sacha, who we see transform from an idealistic student to a husband haunted by revolution to an empowered Soviet monster. By the end, Zhivago is burned out, and so are we after nearly 3.5 hours, but it's a great feeling. The DVD documentary is mainly composed of scenes from the film interspersed with comments from contemporary Hollywood people who made big films like ET, Big and War Of The Worlds. One of the fellows, Mikael Salomon, recalls working as a projectionist in a theatre that was showing the film, and the grandiosity of screening the epic. They take apart scenes, including the riot scene (and how it's played out on Zhivago's face) that includes the splash of blood on white snow that symbolizes both the sacrifices of the revolution as well as Lara's deflowering; the suicide attempt and Zhivago's revelation; as well as Zhivago's final farewell to his true love. One commentator points out that David Lean had made a cold film as a companion to his earlier films Bridge Over The River Kwai and Lawrence Of Arabia - one in snow, another in jungle, and another in the desert. The economic script is equally highly regarded, and how it uses visuals but not dialogue to suggest events.The DVD contains a flowing number of special features:Interactive menu of cast facts&#34;Doctor Zhivago: The Making of a Russian Epic&#34; - 1 hour - Explains how Doctor Zhivago cost $15 million to make, one of the most expensive films ever made up to that time. After a short period of popular indifference to it, the theme song took off, and then the film was catapulted into fame - the Zhivago look came into fashion (mustaches, etc), and baby girls were named Lara. Rod Steiger is interviewed, defending the loathsome character he plays, and Sharif and other individuals pitch in. There was no compromise for Lean - actresses went under trains and were injured, but he continued the shot. Talk of Pasternak and his parallels with Zhivago, with creepy pictures of him - the Jewish poet who loved two women at the same time, and who didn't intend for his book to be political (but of course it was). Interview with the real &#34;Lara&#34; in 1993 - Olga Ivinskaya. &#34;An orgy of feelings began for Zhivago when he met Olga&#34;. He wrote for 10 years, won Nobel prize in 1958. Pasternak loved Russia, died there in 1960. The book was only published in Russia in 1988, and Lean's film released in 1994. Olga did two prison sentences in Soviet work camps, possibly for her connection to Pasternak. How to work a 700-page poem to a 284-page screenplay. Finding a location was tough - Yugoslavia did not feel right. Finland and Sweden didn't have a studio on hand (although some winter scenes were shot in Finland). So in Spain Lean finds horse riders, extras, technical people, and they build sets there and fake the seasonal changes. Looks great. The ice palace was made out of bees wax. Nicholas Roeg worked on it, but left the production after disagreements. Winter scenes may have been in Spain, but the season of the scenes changed from day-to-day. Roeg was replaced by Freddy Young. Maurice Jarre tells story of writing Lara's theme, how he came up with the tune but made it sound Russian by adding balalaikas from a Russian Orthodox church in LA. But the 22 balalaika players couldn't read music, so he had to made sure they understood his hand movements. Meanwhile, in Spain, Generalissimo Franco's spies discovered the cast singing &#34;the Internationale&#34;, it nearly caused a problem. &#34;Maybe they'll sing in tune after the revolution.&#34; Steiger's slap of Lara with gloves was unscripted and real. The womens' hair was very 1960s. One year in pre-production, one year filming, eight weeks post-production! The Sound Of Music was the big Oscar winner that year.&#34;Zhivago, Behind The Camera With David Lean&#34; - 10 minutes - Nice documentary with David Lean talking, mentions Geraldine Chaplin's screen test. &#34;Moscow rose anew outside Madrid.&#34; Lean was correct to the last detail.&#34;David Lean's Films And Doctor Zhivago&#34; - 7 minutes - Focuses on incidents around the Nobel Prize Pasternak won in 1958, Pasternak's life, the film project coming together, the 10-acre Moscow set re-created outside of Madrid. Documentary made for Hollywood Paramount theatre.&#34;Moscow In Madrid&#34; - 5 minutes - Production shots, propaganda.&#34;Pasternak&#34; - 8 minutes - Focus on Nobel prize, and explains Pasternak's charmed life. Tolstoi and Rilke were family friends. The young Pasternak had wanted to be a composer, but ends up a poet. His mother was a piano prodigy. On his death bed, Tolstoi left a message for Pasternak!&#34;New York Press Interview With Julie Christie&#34; - 10 minutes - Meandering and unedited press interviews. &#34;You are an individual!&#34; Christie's surprised when her words from an earlier interview are read out to her - airhead? Has an anti-marriage message, and hints that film stars are squares. No privacy, no time, can't live a private life. Three interviews, with questions like &#34;How do you like the USA as compared to your home country?&#34; &#34;I like New York!&#34;&#34;New York Press Interview With Omar Sharif&#34; - 18 minutes - No mustache, to our great disappointment, then he's interviewed by five journalists. Inane banter about beddy time, and mutual friends, partying, who he's hanging out with. Lots of background noise here. Discussion around how he can remember people's names if he meets them again in the same location. Goofing around on pronunciation of the name &#34;Zhiavago.&#34; Worried about his future and next project. Ascribes his success to luck.&#34;Geraldine Chaplin screen test&#34; - 3 minutes - Geraldine does the scene where she's reading the letter from Zhivago twice.&#34;This Is Julie Christie&#34; - 1 minute - Fluff, with no original shots of the actress.&#34;This Is Geraldine Chaplin&#34; - 1 minute - Fluff, with no original shots of the actress.&#34;This Is Omar Sharif&#34; - 1 minute - Fluff, with no original shots of the actor.&#34;Chaplin In New York&#34; - 2 minutes - Original shots of Geraldine vamping around the city, some interviewing, and plenty of silly narration: &#34;In some ways she is a teenager, and in some very much a woman; in many ways she is still a star-struck girl, although she is already a star. But in all ways she is Geraldine Chaplin, a bona-fide original. To some she is natural, shy, unassuming. Others know her as the girl who arrived in New York dressed in matching hat, jacket and pants of striped fur. But everyone agrees that Geraldine Chaplin has an effect on people, in spite of herself.&#34;&#34;Original Trailer&#34; - 4 minutesThe CD contains eight tracks of original music from the film, totaling 22 minutes. Things like the Overture, Lara's Theme, the end title, and the music of significant scenes from throughout the film.",5,"Great film, great bonus features",1388448000,"12 31,

When I saw it the first time, it was a lovely portrayal of a family in the upheavals of Russia. I read the original book and was captivated by the theme. The story of an ideal person during the hard times is difficult to capture in a movie. A lot of the reviewers gave the movie a bad rating due to this. However, I do not give too much heed to this as I have enjoyed a number of movies that reviewers trashed. A review happens due to the circumstances of the times etc. This movie has stood the test of times. The book is more detailed about the communism and its impact on the people. It has more layers in the story than shown in the movie.The movie is well photographed and put together. Some of the actors like Julie Christie and Rod Steiger do a lovely job. I wish that they had a person who looks more Russian as Zhivago. Some of the screenplay should have been changed. The interaction between Alec Guiness and the daughter was not well done. The part with Zhivago and his wife was lovely and will tear you apart. A lot of Russians did not like the movie. Seen superficially, it would seem like a simple love triangle that has a depressing end. The story is more involved than that. Once seen in the times that it is set in, it will seem more plausible. While the movie does not do justice to the book, it is still impressive. The 2 disc version is a lovely version. This is one of the great movies of David Lean.

381491,A2GJ98824GGXGP,6303599109,Timothy Kearney,"[6, 7]","DR. ZHIVAGO was one of the last great epic films produced by Hollywood. In the 1950's and 60's, a string of films were produced that resembled closely resembled grand opera without music: the casts were large, the stories intricate, and the settings spectacular. Some were great successes such as BEN HUR. Others are notable disasters, with CLEOPATRA perhaps being the best known example. DR. ZHIVAGO may be the most enduring of these epic films. It's based on a novel by Boris Pasternak that was banned in the USSR which only added to the fascination of audiences in the United States. The film boasts of an all star cast. It has one of the most beloved musical scores. It seems that no expense was spared in the filming. It was also a bit shocking for some American audiences in terms of material. Few American films in the early 1960's dealt with a man who loved two women with love scenes to boot! Of course it would be tame and perhaps too simplistic fare for an audience of today, but it was daring at the time.The film tells the story of Yuri Zhivago (played by Omar Sharif). We learn his story form his half brother, Yevgraf Zhivago (Alec Guinness), a general and official in the USSR He's questioning a young woman (Rita Tushingham) about her origins, believing that the young woman is his niece. As the general speaks with the young woman, we learn that the young Yuri Zhivago is orphaned as a boy and taken in by his mother's friends. He follows in the footsteps of the man who raised him and becomes a doctor, but at heart he's a poet and writes beautiful verse. He marries Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin), the daughter of the people who raised him and has a daughter and a charmed life. He also becomes smitten with a woman named Lara (Julie Christie), a young woman who is the wife of Pasha (Tom Courtney), a man who later becomes a revolutionary and the unwilling lover of Victor Komarovsky (Rod Steiger), a lawyer and expert at survival. Yuri and Lara become lovers and he ends up writing beautiful verse about her. The film is more than just a story of a love triangle. It's set in the World War I and early Bolshevik era and throughout the film we see people make difficult choices just to survive. The fact that Yuri is both a doctor who cares for the sick and a poet who cares for the heart is meant to show the triumph of the human spirit in the midst of tragedy. Perhaps this is why the story still has power today.This two disc version has the film on one two sided DVD  and a second DVD that includes the making of the film, interviews with the actors, and the tidbits that film buffs love. It's a great addition to any film collection, especially since this is a film that can be seen more than once and always be appreciated.",5,One of Hollywood's Great Epic Films,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,2745,"['DR.', 'ZHIVAGO', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'great', 'epic', 'films', 'produced', 'Hollywood', '1950', '60', ""'s"", 'string', 'films', 'were', 'produced', 'resembled', 'closely', 'resembled', 'grand', 'opera', 'music', 'casts', 'were', 'large', 'stories', 'intricate', 'settings', 'spectacular', 'were', 'great', 'successes', 'such', 'BEN', 'HUR', 'Others', 'are', 'notable', 'disasters', 'CLEOPATRA', 'perhaps', 'being', 'best', 'known', 'example', 'DR.', 'ZHIVAGO', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'enduring', 'epic', 'films', 'based', 'novel', 'Boris', 'Pasternak', 'was', 'banned', 'USSR', 'only', 'added', 'fascination', 'audiences', 'United', 'States', 'film', 'boasts', 'star', 'cast', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'musical', 'scores', 'expense', 'was', 'spared', 'filming', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'shocking', 'American', 'audiences', 'terms', 'material', 'Few', 'American', 'films', 'early', '1960', 'dealt', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'two', 'women', 'love', 'scenes', 'boot', 'course', 'would', 'be', 'tame', 'perhaps', 'too', 'simplistic', 'fare', 'audience', 'today', 'was', 'daring', 'time.The', 'film', 'story', 'Yuri', 'Zhivago', 'played', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'learn', 'story', 'form', 'half', 'brother', 'Yevgraf', 'Zhivago', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'general', 'official', 'USSR', 'questioning', 'young', 'woman', 'Rita', 'Tushingham', 'origins', 'believing', 'young', 'woman', 'niece', 'general', 'speaks', 'young', 'woman', 'learn', 'young', 'Yuri', 'Zhivago', 'orphaned', 'boy', 'taken', 'mother', 'friends', 'footsteps', 'man', 'who', 'raised', 'doctor', 'heart', 'poet', 'beautiful', 'verse', 'Tonya', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin', 'daughter', 'people', 'who', 'raised', 'daughter', 'charmed', 'life', 'also', 'smitten', 'woman', 'named', 'Lara', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'wife', 'Pasha', 'Tom', 'Courtney', 'man', 'who', 'later', 'revolutionary', 'unwilling', 'lover', 'Victor', 'Komarovsky', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'lawyer', 'expert', 'survival', 'Yuri', 'Lara', 'become', 'lovers', 'up', 'writing', 'beautiful', 'verse', 'film', 'more', 'just', 'story', 'love', 'triangle', 'set', 'World', 'War', 'early', 'Bolshevik', 'era', 'film', 'see', 'people', 'make', 'difficult', 'choices', 'just', 'survive', 'fact', 'Yuri', 'doctor', 'who', 'sick', 'poet', 'who', 'heart', 'meant', 'show', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit', 'midst', 'tragedy', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'story', 'still', 'power', 'today.This', 'two', 'disc', 'version', 'film', 'one', 'two', 'sided', 'DVD', 'second', 'DVD', 'making', 'film', 'interviews', 'actors', 'tidbits', 'film', 'buffs', 'love', 'great', 'addition', 'film', 'collection', 'especially', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'once', 'always', 'be', 'appreciated']",Doctor Zhivago VHS

The photography and editing are occasionally stunning, but they deserve a better story and a better cast of actors. Not one of the principals is Russian. I'm not sure any of the supporting actors are Russian either. The suspension of disbelief would be eased if the largely British cast did not sound so, well, so British. Accents aside, the acting is poor. Sharif and Christie look wonderful, but can barely deliver their lines. Ralph Richardson is simply dreadful, as always. Chaplin is as lightweight as Christie and Sharif, and Courtney's one-note intensity is amateurish. Only Guinness and Steiger emerge unscathed. Bolt's dialogue is often laughably bad, unrealistic and inappropriate. Indeed, there's a distinct lack of verisimilitude throughout. Witness Christie's full makeup and false black eyelashes while both at ballrooms in Tzarist Moscow and hospitals in the battlefield. So why give this movie even three stars? Easy. There are several protracted sequences where, mercifully, nobody speaks. They are stunning. They are a feature of most of Lean's films, and never are such sequences more welcome than when they crop up in Dr. Zhivago. They account for maybe three minutes in a movie lasting over three hours. But they're worth the effort. I should also add, and probably unnecessarily, that while Christie is not, at least here,  a convincing actress, her unusal and radiant beauty lights up even the worst of the scenes to which she and the rest of us are subjected.

The way it was meant to be experienced. The movie is a poem.The colour red is used as a motif. From the red of protest banners marching through Moscow, the plush red opulence of the restaurant on new year's eve. The red of blood on the snow. Her red dress of compliance.Those examples are within the first hour. Late in the movie you are reminded of these times, these red times, by the tiny red head scarf of the child's doll upon a rocking horse. All alone in an empty, icy house as the bad man comes to abuse Lara. Take her away from love.A film of dark and light. Of power. Power over men, over a man, over a woman. Power of ideas. And those sunflowers. Defiant with their colour, with their existence. Like the daffodils in Yuri's garden. The yellow train that brings his safe wife. The kiss of two old people sleeping on the floor of a cattle train in amongst the straw and disinfectant: the old woman smiles with her eyes still closed. The forced labour man looks-on chained to his bed with his speech of freedom ridiculed by that one solitary kiss. Power.And eyes. The way the director uses eyes to show not tell of the passion, the hurt, the hunger and the love. Beauty in the depths of anarchy. The music of the balalaika. The red balalaika. His mum's balalaika.For me I am reminded of Those Times. Those Times of total freedom of the working classes. The 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. You see it in those names: Rita Tushingham, Tom Courtney, Julie Christie. The stunning Lara. Days of freedom. The freedom to be yourself. Not chained to consumerism.

I saw this the first time when I was 13 and fell in love with the movie back then for the timeless love story and just the amazing photography on the big screen.  Years later as an adult I found the factual backdrop of the Russian Revolution well done in a way many could understand since not much is taught here in the USA history books about that period of time in the world and specifically Russia and its step into becoming the Soviet Union and the Communist Giant of the world.  Even this many years later the photography is amazing in its protrayal of Russian winters and period costumes.  The love story of the main characters is timeless.
