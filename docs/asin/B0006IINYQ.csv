He could barely talk but he adored this video.  He memorized the words to all the songs.  He jumped and danced and twirled for hours.  I've since searched just to find this so that if I EVER have grandchildren, they can enjoy it just as much.  After I bought it, a neighbors child found it in my DVD cabinet and wanted it, so I gave it to him.  I'm now buying it for my great-nieces for Christmas as they are BIG Elmo fans.  It may seem just a little dated as the clothing isn't exactly the latest fashion, but I don't think the kids would notice one bit!
