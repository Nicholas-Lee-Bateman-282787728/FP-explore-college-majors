Some say, glibly, they would rather have strawberry shortcake. Well, this just makes us question their level of libido to begin with. Most of the other reviews are correct..a really lovely job, by two lovely people. I suppose if this were permissible in the 15th century, Caravaggio would have painted a scene or two like this. Certainly Fragonard did..and as 'heads were rolling' in the French Revolution, he quickly tried to destroy all his artistic erotica before his head rolled. As it happened, a close friend in David, a fave of the revolution, Fragonard was spared on Davi'd testimony, and was made curator of the Louvre.Point being human sexuality is a beautiful thing. A good try was made here to underscore that simple fact. The actors did a very good job. Most may be disappointed in the 'half light' - chiascuro or tennebrosso - faces, limbs, body parts emerging from deep darkness - also an Utrecht School technique, by such as Honthorst.One of the many things absent here is work by a gifted writer. The script is , well, a few pages?...and light years from what might have emerged from one of the great U.K poets. This is part of the 'dumbed down' age we all woke up in...sloppy shoes, ho hum clothes, and  sorry speech...the word &#34;literary&#34; ( along with representational oil painting, vis 19th century ) has been thrown out as unneccesary. ( sigh )By sorry speech, way too many U.K. productions have a glaring fault, that those who live in the U.K. could not possibly notice..&#34;can't see the woods for the trees effect&#34;..but the behaviour is awkward, the speech pattern is something like skipping a stone across a pond...the high spots are hit ~ of words...not the entire word. Notice yourself how the speech 'bounces' along with some decibel level hearable..and some whole syllables with utterly no decibel level. Add this to rapid, ( sloppy ) speech, and we have every word &#34;contracted&#34; as in &#34;can't&#34;, &#34;won't&#34;, &#34;sha'n't&#34;...the Brits seem full of themselves as having perfect diction, and nothing could be farther from the truth. You would have to watch &#34;True Grit&#34; with Jeff Bridges to see clearly what I mean. This is a script by the famous Coen brothers..whose dialogues seem downright Shakesperean compared to this &#34;Matinee&#34; script.(&#34;Matinee&#34; for a title poitns to lack of originality..just tye in matinee, an see the thousands of hits..your literary work is guaranteed to be lost forever in the great pile of books churned out by the thousands each day )In the Coen film the young woman , brilliant actress, shoots Josh Brolin, who replies &#34; I did not think that you would do it&#34;..You see?...NO contractions! This, and &#34;Mumbling!&#34;... epidemic in movies today, while background/ambient noise blanks out dozens of syllables,..and you have unintelligble speech..as unintelligible as the lovely bodies are &#34;indistinct&#34; ~ and half in darkness. In a word, the film, the script, the bodies are almost obfuscated  both from excessive timidity, and a realization that &#34;this is not great literature&#34;..and it sure isn't.If you want to compare apples to apples, I suggest you also buy &#34;Don't Look Down&#34;...now THAT is erotic!..and with the same two  people, only ~  featured, like this one is ~ but &#34;Don't Look Down&#34; is in clear, unabashed , unashamed light..and with a good script...and better cinematography by far.Buy this one too..but you will see how much more of a success &#34;Don't Look Down&#34; is.",3,"lacks originality, creativity, timeless script, and cinematography",1404345600,"07 3, 2014",2014,3653,"['idea', 'present', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'human', 'sexual', 'union', 'little', 'Earth', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'say', 'glibly', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'strawberry', 'shortcake', 'Well', 'just', 'question', 'level', 'libido', 'begin', 'Most', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'correct..a', 'really', 'lovely', 'job', 'two', 'lovely', 'people', 'suppose', 'were', 'permissible', '15th', 'century', 'Caravaggio', 'would', 'have', 'painted', 'scene', 'two', 'Certainly', 'Fragonard', 'did..and', ""'heads"", 'were', 'rolling', 'French', 'Revolution', 'quickly', 'tried', 'destroy', 'artistic', 'erotica', 'head', 'rolled', 'happened', 'close', 'friend', 'David', 'fave', 'revolution', 'Fragonard', 'was', 'spared', 'Davi', ""'d"", 'testimony', 'was', 'made', 'curator', 'Louvre.Point', 'being', 'human', 'sexuality', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'good', 'try', 'was', 'made', 'here', 'underscore', 'simple', 'fact', 'actors', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'Most', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', ""'half"", 'light', 'chiascuro', 'tennebrosso', 'limbs', 'body', 'parts', 'emerging', 'deep', 'darkness', 'also', 'Utrecht', 'School', 'technique', 'such', 'Honthorst.One', 'many', 'things', 'absent', 'here', 'work', 'gifted', 'writer', 'script', 'well', 'few', 'pages', 'light', 'years', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'emerged', 'one', 'great', 'U.K', 'poets', 'part', ""'dumbed"", 'age', 'woke', 'up', 'sloppy', 'shoes', 'ho', 'hum', 'clothes', 'sorry', 'speech', 'word', '34', 'literary', '34', 'representational', 'oil', 'painting', 'vis', '19th', 'century', 'been', 'thrown', 'out', 'unneccesary', 'sigh', 'sorry', 'speech', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'U.K.', 'productions', 'have', 'glaring', 'fault', 'who', 'live', 'U.K.', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'notice..', '34', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'woods', 'trees', 'effect', '34', 'behaviour', 'awkward', 'speech', 'pattern', 'something', 'skipping', 'stone', 'pond', 'high', 'spots', 'are', 'hit', '~', 'words', 'not', 'entire', 'word', 'Notice', 'how', 'speech', ""'bounces"", 'decibel', 'level', 'hearable..and', 'whole', 'syllables', 'utterly', 'decibel', 'level', 'Add', 'rapid', 'sloppy', 'speech', 'have', 'word', '34', 'contracted', '34', '34', 'ca', ""n't"", '34', '34', 'wo', ""n't"", '34', '34', 'sha', ""n't"", '34', 'Brits', 'seem', 'full', 'having', 'perfect', 'diction', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'farther', 'truth', 'would', 'have', 'watch', '34', 'True', 'Grit', '34', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'see', 'clearly', 'what', 'mean', 'script', 'famous', 'Coen', 'brothers..whose', 'dialogues', 'seem', 'downright', 'Shakesperean', 'compared', '34', 'Matinee', '34', 'script', '34', 'Matinee', '34', 'title', 'poitns', 'lack', 'originality..just', 'tye', 'matinee', 'see', 'thousands', 'hits..your', 'literary', 'work', 'guaranteed', 'be', 'lost', 'forever', 'great', 'pile', 'books', 'churned', 'out', 'thousands', 'day', 'Coen', 'film', 'young', 'woman', 'brilliant', 'actress', 'shoots', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'who', '34', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'would', 'do', '34', 'see', 'NO', 'contractions', '34', 'Mumbling', '34', 'epidemic', 'movies', 'today', 'background/ambient', 'noise', 'out', 'dozens', 'syllables', '..and', 'have', 'unintelligble', 'speech..as', 'unintelligible', 'lovely', 'bodies', 'are', '34', 'indistinct', '34', '~', 'half', 'darkness', 'word', 'film', 'script', 'bodies', 'are', 'almost', 'obfuscated', 'excessive', 'timidity', 'realization', '34', 'not', 'great', 'literature', '34', '..and', 'sure', 'want', 'compare', 'apples', 'apples', 'suggest', 'also', 'buy', '34', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Down', '34', 'now', 'THAT', 'erotic', '..and', 'same', 'two', 'people', 'only', '~', 'featured', 'one', '~', '34', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Down', '34', 'clear', 'unabashed', 'unashamed', 'light..and', 'good', 'script', 'better', 'cinematography', 'far.Buy', 'one', 'too..but', 'will', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'success', '34', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Down', '34']",N/A

The reviews by critics have indicated that their love scene did not show much emotion.  At any rate both actors meet and discuss the need to get into the real personalities of the characters they are representing in the story. They both express their hesitancy to go much further, but agree to try.  The result is an explicit love scene that shows them going further into the characters than had been done before.  After the matinee showing they get together and discuss how the audience has received their performance.  The reviews from the critics are now very positive.  I believe that love scenes showed be done in this manner.
