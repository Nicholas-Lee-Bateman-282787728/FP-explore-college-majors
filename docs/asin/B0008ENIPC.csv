I can't even imagine the horror of all the women who have had to deal with his rotund naked awfulness.  Now we have to deal with his more rotund, aged and just awful appearance clothed.  He can't act, he's not interesting and he's downright a movie ruiner.  But, unfortunately for this movie, he didn't ruin this one; it was ruined far before he was cast in a role.  This is just another ultra low budget poorly conceived and even poorly executed zombie concept.  People randomly show up at a house, then find they're hunted by zombies, then attempt to deal with that situation.  No plot whatsoever to establish any realism or believability.

898820,A3SBCBEN4NGK5I,B0008ENIPC,B-Movie Fan,"[1, 1]","For lovers of campy b-movies, this flick rates a 2.5 (rounded down to 2) and might be worth a watch just for grins and giggles. For pretty much anyone else, this movie barely rates a 1.Seven local teenagers decide to spend Halloween night inside a deserted house with a ""history"".  They don't seem to actually know the history, just that it's supposed to be haunted.  Just to be a ""little"" different than the norm, this same house is also being used to film a horror movie.  We never see any of the production crew, cameras, or actors, (who evidently don't work on weekends) but there are lots of movie props lying around for the teenagers to use on each other, trip over, accidentally pick-up when they need a real weapon to save themselves, etc..  In many ways, this is where the movie went wrong.  If the actors/crew who were filming the ""fake"" horror movie had wandered on screen to share time (and get killed) with the local teenagers . . . you would at least have had a more original movie.  Maybe not any better, but at least a little different.Instead, the local teenagers are joined by two grave robbers (one of whom is played by Ron Jeremy) who are being pursued by a horde of zombies.  (The grave robbers stole an amulet from the grave of an undead evil high priest . . . don't ask.)  There's lots of conflict between the two groups inside the house and even more between the humans and the zombies.The writers of this piece of fluff do get credit for trying.  There are some cute lines and at least an effort is made to be funny and clever.  However, not only do many of the lines fall flat, some are just God awful.  For example, at one point two brothers decide that they are going to make a mad dash through the hordes of zombies, never mind why. One brother turns to his girlfriend and says, ""My brother was the best defensive player on the team.  It will be just like football.  He'll run the defense and I'll run the offense.""  I can forgive the lame special effects.  I can forgive the tired plot (how many times have we seen a group of people trapped in a house and attacked by zombies?).  This bit of dialogue, along with several others, is just unforgivable.If you are a big fan of zombie movies or of low budget horror/comedies, this one is worth a watch (but only a watch, this is a definite rental), otherwise steer clear.",2,"The writers of this piece of fluff do get credit for trying, but . . .",1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,2347,"['lovers', 'campy', 'b-movies', 'flick', 'rates', '2.5', 'rounded', 'down', '2', 'might', 'be', 'watch', 'just', 'grins', 'giggles', 'pretty', 'much', 'anyone', 'else', 'movie', 'barely', 'rates', '1.Seven', 'local', 'teenagers', 'decide', 'spend', 'Halloween', 'night', 'deserted', 'house', 'history', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'actually', 'know', 'history', 'just', 'supposed', 'be', 'haunted', 'Just', 'be', 'little', 'different', 'norm', 'same', 'house', 'also', 'being', 'used', 'film', 'horror', 'movie', 'never', 'see', 'production', 'crew', 'cameras', 'actors', 'who', 'evidently', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'weekends', 'are', 'lots', 'movie', 'props', 'lying', 'around', 'teenagers', 'use', 'other', 'trip', 'accidentally', 'pick-up', 'when', 'need', 'real', 'weapon', 'save', 'etc..', 'many', 'ways', 'where', 'movie', 'went', 'wrong', 'actors/crew', 'who', 'were', 'filming', 'fake', 'horror', 'movie', 'had', 'wandered', 'screen', 'share', 'time', 'get', 'killed', 'local', 'teenagers', 'would', 'least', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'original', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'not', 'better', 'least', 'little', 'different.Instead', 'local', 'teenagers', 'are', 'joined', 'two', 'grave', 'robbers', 'one', 'whom', 'played', 'Ron', 'Jeremy', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'pursued', 'horde', 'zombies', 'grave', 'robbers', 'stole', 'amulet', 'grave', 'undead', 'evil', 'high', 'priest', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'lots', 'conflict', 'two', 'groups', 'house', 'even', 'more', 'humans', 'zombies.The', 'writers', 'piece', 'fluff', 'do', 'get', 'credit', 'trying', 'are', 'cute', 'lines', 'least', 'effort', 'made', 'be', 'funny', 'clever', 'However', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'many', 'lines', 'fall', 'flat', 'are', 'just', 'God', 'awful', 'example', 'one', 'point', 'two', 'brothers', 'decide', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'mad', 'dash', 'hordes', 'zombies', 'never', 'mind', 'why', 'One', 'brother', 'girlfriend', 'brother', 'was', 'best', 'defensive', 'player', 'team', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'football', ""'ll"", 'run', 'defense', ""'ll"", 'run', 'offense', 'can', 'forgive', 'lame', 'special', 'effects', 'can', 'forgive', 'tired', 'plot', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'group', 'people', 'trapped', 'house', 'attacked', 'zombies', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'several', 'others', 'just', 'unforgivable.If', 'are', 'big', 'fan', 'zombie', 'movies', 'low', 'budget', 'horror/comedies', 'one', 'watch', 'only', 'watch', 'definite', 'rental', 'otherwise', 'steer', 'clear']",The Wickeds
898821,A1H0CWFQY2HFGG,B0008ENIPC,"Bud Bundy ""B movie lover""","[7, 8]","This is about some kids that go to a supposedly haunted house where a low budget horror movie is being filmed.  At the same time, some grave robbers dig up a corpse in a nearby cemetery in order to steal a valuable amulet.  This causes all the bodies in the cemetery to come to life, the grave robbers run to the house the kids are in, and everybody runs around frantically until the end.I really wasn't expecting much when I got this;  it looked like an extremely low budget haunted house / zombie movie.  I was prepared for the usual bad acting, bad writing, and ridiculous plot.  What I wasn't prepared for was the utterly amateurish camerawork - you can literally get seasick watching this thing.  I believe it was filmed by a guy who drank a pint of Jack Daniels, sprained his ankle, and then picked up a handheld video camera and staggered and stumbled around for the entire duration of the production.  And let's not forget the sound either.  While it's not uncommon to be unable to hear what the characters are saying because the microphone was too far away, you do get the sound of their footsteps loud and clear (through the rear speakers for some reason).  And then there's the whole comedy angle the thing goes for - when the zombies attack, we're treated to a nu-metal soundtrack blasting through the speakers, complete with that silly cookie monster singing.  There are a lot more attempts at comedy, they all fall entirely flat.Now, I could probably live through all this, but it has to go even further.  Almost all the characters spend the last half of the movie screaming frantically at each other.  Oh boy, is this ever a joy to sit through.  The only two characters who don't engage in this festival of supreme annoyance are one of the grave robbers, who sits in a chair making deadpan comments and ordering people around, and the blond girl, who is the only one to keep a cool head.  She's the only likable character in the whole movie.The single redeeming quality about this mess is a long make-out scene between a girl in pink underwear and her boyfriend.

898822,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0008ENIPC,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Just having to look at Ron Jeremy is bad enough on its own (although, thankfully, he stays fully clothed here), but even the prospect of seeing his character savagely killed does nothing to ease the pain of watching a movie this pathetic and abysmal.  The Wickeds is a film that even the director couldn't possibly love.  There's not even any female nudity to help get you through it - although, quite frankly, I wouldn't particularly like to see any of these actresses nude, anyway.  The lack of nudity is confusing, though, because everything else about this film conveys the impression that it was written and filmed by a twelve-year-old boy.  Sure, there's plenty of gore, but it's horribly fake and unconvincing.  And the acting?  Well, Ron Jeremy is by far the most talented actor involved in this project - need I say more?There is barely even a story underlying all of this cinematic torture.  Seven incredibly annoying, unattractive young people break into this old spooky house where a low-budget horror film is being shot.  Unbeknownst to them, Gus (Ron Jeremy) and his gimboid sidekick are at the nearby cemetery digging up a corpse in order to steal an amulet from the body.  Naturally, the theft of this horrible piece of cosmetic jewelry brings all of the dead bodies out of their graves, and their pursuit of human flesh eventually brings both groups together inside the house.  Will any of the characters survive?  Who smegging cares?Despite the fact that these are clearly zombies doing everything that zombies do, the characters keep referring to them as vampires, which tells you something about the group intelligence on display here.  That's just one of the many, many ways this film annoyed me.  I watch a lot of bad movies - some of them are true gems worthy of cult status; most of them are just forgettable; but a few of them should be considered forms of torture.

This movie at best is mediocre, with basically the same exact plot as Night of the Living Dead. Except in this case a couple of grave robbers steal an amulet of a buried vampire and with that he awaked the Vampire and  form then on all the dead rise to take revenge on the ones who disturbed there sleep then they run to the only house around where they run into a couple of kids that went to this haunted house for Halloween now they are stuck there with Zom,bies every where and you guesed they bored up all the windows etc...So overall the acting is Mediocre, not good not bad sometimes over dramatic but it is a low budget flick with the best actor being Jake the lead guy. The make up effects are also quit good as are any of the violent scenes, no CGI, all make up effects which is awesome. they did a very good job with the Zombie makeup like I said for a low budget but a good example of there Zombies are close in resembling Zombies from movies such as Dead Next Door and Stink of flesh, which is quit good some have great make up some are just basically blue-ish grey with blood on them.The plot is very much a bite off of N.O.T.L.D but throws in its own twist of ghosts and Vampires that actually works very well, the makeup on the lead Vampire is also very good.Overall this is a movie worth the rent for all you Zombie fans to buy  I dont know at $13 is pretty cheap, and this movie was not bad at all there was Gore which is always good and there was a decent amount of it. So Im still stcuk deciding if I will buy it or not just check it out for your self a overall good movie worth a rent then its up to you to decide if you will purchase it. If I want to watch a movie similar to The Wicked I will just watch the great Night Of the Living Dead.

It doesn't take itself serious, it's all done knowing it's not a classic, it's just a bad b-movie...and that's what makes it a GOOD b-movie!",5,Tries to be stupid...and wins,1252800000,"09 13, 2009",2009,1786,"['think', 'alot', 'other', 'reviewers', 'film', 'were', 'expecting', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'actually', 'saw', 'tried', 'review', 'serious', '-movie-template', 'mind', 'not', 'using', 'bad-b-movie-template', 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'take', 'serious', 'so', 'why', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'serious', 'entry', 'horror', 'genre', 'Dollar', 'Days', 'Kmart', 'type', 'film', 'kids', 'are', 'supposedly', 'going', 'horror', 'movie', 'set', 'party', 'weekend', 'What', 'horror', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'store', 'bought', 'Halloween', 'decorations', 'props', 'Even', 'zombie', 'make', 'up', 'white', 'clown', 'face', 'paint', 'grease', 'stuff.The', 'acting', 'bad', 'not', 'Oscar', 'type', 'acting', 'more', 'bad', 'porn', 'type', 'acting', 'oh', 'wait', 'Porn', 'legend', 'Ron', 'Creepy', 'Jeremy', 'starring', 'type', 'acting', 'type', 'movie', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'class', 'type', 'acting', 'alot', 'wrought', 'crying', 'squealing.As', 'editing', 'are', 'LOADS', 'mistakes', 'producers', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'fun', 'film', 'pick', 'mistakes', 'out', 'make', 'out', 'scene', 'bedroom', 'house', 'camera', 'shot', 'camera', 'shot', 'couple', 'seem', 'be', 'taking', 'clothes', 'off', 'putting', 'back', 'One', 'shot', 'guy', 'jeans', 'next', 'off', 'next', 'are', 'back', 'scene', 'zombie', 'house', 'girl', 'house', 'camera', 'distance', 'screaming', 'meanwhile', 'back', 'house', 'cut', 'kids', 'jumping', 'zombie', 'house', 'back', 'ground', 'see', 'girl', 'running', 'back', 'door', '.again', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'be', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'rotteness', ""n't"", 'take', 'serious', 'done', 'knowing', 'not', 'classic', 'just', 'bad', 'b-movie', 'what', 'GOOD', 'b-movie']",The Wickeds
