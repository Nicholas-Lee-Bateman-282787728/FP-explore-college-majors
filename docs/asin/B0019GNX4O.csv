I got season 5 First then went to season 1, so my prospective is abit different. I First saw the serie with Tom Selleck and thought, ""not bad"". I really enjoyed season 5 and it really had alot of new potential to develope. The last episode tho is a joke! Knowing the series was to be cancelled, you'd think NBC wouild have allowed one more episode to be filmed or an extra 30 mins added to the final. But to be leading up to such drama and to end the entire show with...to be continued...  COME ON!  I was pi$$#Ed off!  I cant recall any show getting such a raw deal after 5 seasons, maybe there has been, but what a complete joke!Anyhow...then I went to season 1 and saw the great chemistry with James Caan and the Ice Queen and so on. The show was better the first 4 season, but season 5 wasnt bad either.

Hell, they're so un-loyal to the fans that they ended it with a cliffhanger. Sure I Tivo Crusoe on Friday nights but the show doesn't entertain me as much as Las Vegas used to. I actually looked forward to watching tv on Fridays due to this show. The show isn't as good this season, yet it still had a lot of energy and steam left.I did miss James Caan and he was barely even mentioned after leaving, even by the woman who plays his daughter. That didn't even ruin the series for me though. Vanessa Marcil was always incredibly hot as Sam and I don't even want to ever see her play any other character, I just want to see more of her in the role. Nikki Cox was cute in the other seasons but she got a little too whiny after awhile. Camille Guaty was a good replacement for her this season. She was super cute and after awhile it just felt like she was always on the show. I also think that Tom Selleck was a great replacement for James Caan and it's shame that the show was canceled during his first season.

1163469,A33LUPPKCBY906,B0019GNX4O,"Wunder One ""Bruhaazul""","[1, 4]","~~ Watching Season 5 of Las Vegas is just about as interesting as watching paint dry.Did someone not notice that Cooper as a ""mystery man"" looked exactly like a dull guy in an undertaker's suit smoking cigars, bowling, and schlepping around?  The crime hijinks used to be a little fun to watch, but that part of the show has faded into the background, with the bland and the more bland taking center stage.~~ Nonetheless, James Lesure keeps his superb Mike Cannon character watchable throughout.  And Vanessa Marcil works valiantly towards not letting the intrepid Sam Marquez be sucked into the stupid woman syndrome into which she is being drawn. Oh, and Polly!  Always so very tacky and always so very funny.~~ It was good to be spared another round of the endlessly pitiful Mary Connell and the insipid Jillian Deline.  But if Ed Deline went away, why couldn't daddy's precious pregnant girl go with him?  This would have left a statistical possibility of the show having another female character with an IQ above room temperature.  But then again ... IQ ... well ... never meant to be what this show was about. It is more about silicon, Botox, and collagen.  I've nothing against ""procedures"", but is there no point at which it is identified as deformity rather than enhancement?~~ People tend to beat up on writers for shows like this, but I work in the corporate world ... truly, it all flows downhill.
