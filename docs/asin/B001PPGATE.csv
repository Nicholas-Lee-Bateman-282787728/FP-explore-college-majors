1228179,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,B001PPGATE,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[1, 1]","This is an Alpha Home Entertainment DVD. I look worse than a VHS copy with that Blair Witch steady hand. Everything is really scratchy. You will recognize most of the actors such as J. Edward Bromberg from ""Charlie Chan on Broadway"" (1937). The story at least the presentation had those holes that you can drive a truck through. It gets slapstick at all the weirdest times.A newspaper owner, Henry Kruger, threatens to dispatch a rival newspaper owner over an article. The one mistake is making this threat was right in front of his chauffer/friend, Andy McDonald and, the other newspaper owner's assistant/patsy 'Slippery Joe' Clary  .And you guessed it a corps is turns up in Henry's car trunk. Then it is not there. Then it is here and there and not hear and there. Now each person sees it and is kind enough not to tell everyone.  We know h did it but no on listens to us.Mack Hogan (Frank Jenks) as the cabin caretaker is the comic relief as if we needed relief.The story sorts of works around Egbert (Charles Coleman) a snickering butler that seems to know something but never tells.Any way the film is worth a quick look. I you miss this one you won't be missing much.If you love bodies being moved then two better movies are:Arsenic and Old lace (1944)AndThe Trouble with Harry (1955)",3,Slapped together slapstick,1342656000,"07 19, 2012",2012,1292,"['Alpha', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'DVD', 'look', 'worse', 'VHS', 'copy', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'steady', 'hand', 'Everything', 'really', 'scratchy', 'will', 'recognize', 'most', 'actors', 'such', 'J.', 'Edward', 'Bromberg', 'Charlie', 'Chan', 'Broadway', '1937', 'story', 'least', 'presentation', 'had', 'holes', 'can', 'drive', 'truck', 'slapstick', 'weirdest', 'times.A', 'newspaper', 'owner', 'Henry', 'Kruger', 'dispatch', 'rival', 'newspaper', 'owner', 'article', 'one', 'mistake', 'making', 'threat', 'was', 'right', 'front', 'chauffer/friend', 'Andy', 'McDonald', 'other', 'newspaper', 'owner', 'assistant/patsy', ""'Slippery"", 'Joe', 'Clary', '.And', 'guessed', 'corps', 'up', 'Henry', 'car', 'trunk', 'Then', 'not', 'there', 'Then', 'here', 'there', 'not', 'hear', 'there', 'Now', 'person', 'kind', 'enough', 'not', 'tell', 'everyone', 'know', 'h', 'did', 'listens', 'us.Mack', 'Hogan', 'Frank', 'Jenks', 'cabin', 'caretaker', 'comic', 'relief', 'needed', 'relief.The', 'story', 'sorts', 'works', 'Egbert', 'Charles', 'Coleman', 'snickering', 'butler', 'know', 'something', 'never', 'way', 'film', 'quick', 'look', 'miss', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'missing', 'much.If', 'love', 'bodies', 'being', 'moved', 'then', 'two', 'better', 'movies', 'are', 'Arsenic', 'Old', 'lace', '1944', 'AndThe', 'Trouble', 'Harry', '1955']",N/A

1228184,A2FFYQZPUGOX58,B001PPGATE,Magnifying Glass,"[3, 3]","One night Danny MacDonald found himself dead - of course, he didn't know it.  At first, everyone thought he was just missing - it was in all the newspapers.In this movie, there are three news sources: The Argus, The Tribune, and The Gossip.Argus: an alert or watchful person.  Danny MacDonald, the shady, double-dealing publisher of The Argus, was a watchful  person, but unfortunately, he should have known better than to trust a murderer.  Danny would never have guessed that he was about to be an unwanted guest of Mr. Kruger.Tribune: a protector of or champion of the people.  Henry Kruger, publisher of The Tribune, thought of himself as the champion of the people, but his family thought of him as a meal ticket.  Henry, feeling unappreciated, takes the advice of his chauffeur and confidant, and decides to get-away-from-it-all, without telling anyone where they were going.  The three of them head off for the hunting lodge: Henry, the chauffeur, and their hidden, unbidden guest.Gossip: a person who habitually spreads gossip  The lady, who ran the general store, was one.  Henry wasted five bucks paying her to keep quiet about his staying at the lodge.(Definitions are from The American Heritage College Dictionary, Third Edition.)Overall this is a good, well-made comedy; enjoyable enough to watch more than once.Picture quality: Fair; the film used as the source for this DvD was degraded.  Significant cropping, most obvious in the title, credits, and a newspaper headline which should read: ""PHYLIS KRUGER IN CAFE BRAWL,"" but what you see is ""LIS KRUGER IN CAFE BRAW.""  The Alpha Home logo is displayed during the title and credits.  Sound quality: Fair, somewhat muffled.If you like movies about inconvenient bodies, check out: Alfred Hitchcock's The Trouble With HarryThe Trouble with Harry.",3,The Trouble With Danny,1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,1808,"['One', 'night', 'Danny', 'MacDonald', 'found', 'dead', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'everyone', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'missing', 'was', 'newspapers.In', 'movie', 'are', 'three', 'news', 'sources', 'Argus', 'Tribune', 'Gossip.Argus', 'alert', 'watchful', 'person', 'Danny', 'MacDonald', 'shady', 'double-dealing', 'publisher', 'Argus', 'was', 'watchful', 'person', 'unfortunately', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'trust', 'murderer', 'Danny', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'guessed', 'was', 'be', 'unwanted', 'guest', 'Mr.', 'Kruger.Tribune', 'protector', 'champion', 'people', 'Henry', 'Kruger', 'publisher', 'Tribune', 'thought', 'champion', 'people', 'family', 'thought', 'meal', 'ticket', 'Henry', 'feeling', 'unappreciated', 'advice', 'chauffeur', 'confidant', 'get-away-from-it-all', 'telling', 'anyone', 'where', 'were', 'going', 'three', 'head', 'hunting', 'lodge', 'Henry', 'chauffeur', 'hidden', 'unbidden', 'guest.Gossip', 'person', 'who', 'habitually', 'gossip', 'lady', 'who', 'ran', 'general', 'store', 'was', 'one', 'Henry', 'wasted', 'five', 'bucks', 'paying', 'keep', 'quiet', 'staying', 'lodge', 'Definitions', 'are', 'American', 'Heritage', 'College', 'Dictionary', 'Third', 'Edition', 'good', 'well-made', 'comedy', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'watch', 'more', 'once.Picture', 'quality', 'Fair', 'film', 'used', 'source', 'DvD', 'was', 'degraded', 'Significant', 'cropping', 'most', 'obvious', 'title', 'credits', 'newspaper', 'headline', 'should', 'read', 'PHYLIS', 'KRUGER', 'IN', 'CAFE', 'BRAWL', 'what', 'see', 'LIS', 'KRUGER', 'IN', 'CAFE', 'BRAW', 'Alpha', 'Home', 'logo', 'displayed', 'title', 'credits', 'Sound', 'quality', 'Fair', 'somewhat', 'movies', 'inconvenient', 'bodies', 'check', 'out', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Trouble', 'HarryThe', 'Trouble', 'Harry']",N/A
