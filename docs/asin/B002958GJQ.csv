This video captures the band at the height of ""LRBmania"", if there was such a thing.  This is full throttle, head on, in your face Little River Band doing what they do and doing it oh-so-well.The video quality isn't the crystal clear high-def picture we have grown accustomed to in this digital age, but this DVD still looks and sounds great.

On my Yamaha receiver, set on Pro Logic Enhanced, it indeed sounded very good and used all 5.1 speakers.

It is my opinion that this DVD shows that the players in LRB understand the importance of harmony as much as the Eagles. I have watched this DVD countless times since I purchased it.

1256721,A1P2NBM3P3TS2X,B002958GJQ,"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[3, 4]","This is a concert DVD of the LRB in concert in October 1981.  Between each song is a brief video segment of members of the band interviewing each other, doing in-studio radio interviews and promos, doing pre-show vocal harmony warm-ups, or some other backstage footage.  Song, video footage, song, video footage, song, video footage, etc.This isn't the original line-up of the band (there are 2 relatively new members at the time) but it may be considered the ""classic"" line-up.  When I saw the LRB back in the late nineties, the 2 ""new"" members from this show were the only members still in the band.  Everyone else was gone.  But enough moaning.There is an interesting typesetting goof on the DVD back cover and the insert page.  The set list includes the songs ""It's Not a Wonder"" and ""Lady"", but they are folded together as one song title by mistake.  They are listed as ""It's Not a Wonder Lady"" not once but twice.  It wasn't until I watched the video and heard the separate songs (and read the correct credits at the end) that I learned there is no such song as ""It's Not a Wonder Lady"".  Just as well, too.  I had no idea what a ""Wonder Lady"" could be.  It's not a ""Wonder Lady"" (pardon the pun).Total running time is about 75 minutes and almost a third of that is non-concert footage.  But the show itself is good and it's nice to hear the LRB again.  The cameramen or director or editor apparently didn't care too much about ""equal time"" considerations.  The keyboard player barely gets a second or two of screen time.  If it weren't for the off-stage footage you wouldn't even know what he looks like.The concert was from nearly 30 years ago and it shows in the video quality.  Very grainy.  But that wasn't unheard of at the time.  Those of us of a certain age are used to video footage like that.  It used to be the norm.  It doesn't bother me one bit, though it may not be a big hit with folks who are only used to (or simply demand) pristine digital video.",5,"Humorous typesetting goof in packaging.
