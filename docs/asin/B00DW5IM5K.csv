Not enough horses (the best is the gal with the trick horse), some comedy, the colt doesn't show up until the last 10 minutes of the movie for all of 2 minutes and the acting was really bad.

They must have read the script from a distance as there was no feeling in the words.  Just blah blah blah.  Very disappointed.  These &#34;actors&#34; should not have been paid.  No one could act.  They should get another job and move away from Hollywood.  This could have been a cute movie with the right actors.  These were not the right &#34;actors&#34;.
