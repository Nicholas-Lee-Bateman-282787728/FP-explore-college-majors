Not bad for a team of EXPENDABLES working together for the first time. VINNIE JONES also did a great performance as the head villian in this cop thriller, these kinds of parts really shows his bad side. Overall, AMBUSHED is a must see movie if you're into great police action.P.S. One movie which DOLPH LUNDGREN battles infected zombies with the help of giant robots is his new release BATTLE OF THE DAMNED.

He has an innocent white bread girlfriend Ashley (Cinthya Bornacelli) who attends college and stays separate from his work. Frank has a partner Eddie (Gianni Capaldi) and Frank desires to take his operation to the next level where he works for Vincent (Vinnie Jones). Unfortunately his crimes do not go unnoticed. He is being followed by DEA agent Maxwell (Dolph Lundgren) and associates. A dirty doughnut eating cop (Randy Couture) is added to the mix.The plot lacks depth and complexity. This is a straight forward crime/drama/thriller/action film. The talents of Dolph Lundgren are under utilized. Oh wait he does rough up a guy for information...only to brush him off and let him go. We needed Dolph for this? They could have used Betty White.The sound track was pretty decent and of course Vinnie Jones does a good job in his limited role. The main problem with this feature was that Frank, the main character, was not someone we could root for. About 1/3 of the way through the film he gives a useless narration on the drug industry and the economy which never really ties into the film.A lower tier rental.

Agent Maxwell (Lundgren) is finally about to reach the center of an international cocaine smuggling ring run by Vincent Camastra (Jones). When his partner Agent Royce gets in over her head it is up to Maxwell to get her out and bring the criminals to justice before it's too late. Dolph Lundgren is an actor who started off with a bang (Rocky 4) then slowly started to fade into straight to DVD movies. Most of them are slow, boring and unnecessary. While this one is nothing amazing or original it was entertaining and better then most of his movies. In between the cookie cutter plot there are some actual interesting dialog and borderline social commentary that makes you think. That is not something you would expect from a Lundgren movie. There really isn't much else to say about this, if you've seen one you've seen them all. On the other hand this is better then most of his, which may be because he isn't in it that much. Overall, Lundgren fans will like this. I give it a B-.",3,Better then most Lundgren movies which may be because he isn't in it that much. Lundgren fans will like this.
