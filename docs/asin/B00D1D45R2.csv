Lafleche-christian,"[1, 1]","Product provided for my honest review.Octonauts: Calling All Sharks! is another great Octonaut adventure and the kids were not disappointed with it. By kids, I mean the grandchildren (ages one, three and five). The kids stayed and watched all of the the episodes on the DVD and then wanted to watch them again. We love sharks and each episode on the DVD is fun and adventurous for the Octonauts and keeps the kids entertained.",5,Keeps the kids entertained!,1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,426,"['Product', 'provided', 'honest', 'review.Octonauts', 'Calling', 'Sharks', 'great', 'Octonaut', 'adventure', 'kids', 'were', 'not', 'disappointed', 'kids', 'mean', 'grandchildren', 'one', 'three', 'five', 'kids', 'stayed', 'watched', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'then', 'wanted', 'watch', 'again', 'love', 'sharks', 'episode', 'DVD', 'fun', 'adventurous', 'Octonauts', 'kids', 'entertained']",Octonauts - Calling all Sharks!

The following is my honest opinion of the DVD.)I can't say enough good things about the Octonauts! On the Octonauts newest DVD release titled Calling All Sharks! we learn about three different types of sharks as well as the comb jelly, pilot fish and the porcupine puffer. This show is so wonderful because it exposes kids to creatures they might otherwise be unaware of. For instance, I had never heard of a cookiecutter or dwarf latern shark prior to watching these episodes. This series is so good about using comedic situations to get kids laughing and learning. My boys (ages 2, 6 and 7) thought the Giant Jelly episode was hilarious! The show has a song at the conclusion of each episode called the creature report where a few interesting facts that were covered in the episode are put into musical form as a sort of review. The DVD has a running time of approximately 70 minutes. My kids and I have always been big fans of WordWorld, and I honestly didn't think there would ever be an educational children's show that could measure up to that caliber of clever. Then, along came the Octonauts. I'm not comparing the two because they teach the same subject matter- WordWorld teaches phonics/spelling while Octonauts focuses on science. However, they're very much alike in that they have a very entertaining and clever way of combining learning and fun! This series is definitely the new favorite in my house! We are already eagerly anticipating the next Octonauts DVD release!",5,Octonauts = Education + Entertainment,1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,1573,"['*Disclosure', 'family', 'was', 'sent', 'DVD', 'review', 'part', 'NCircle', 'Nsider', 'program', 'following', 'honest', 'opinion', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'Octonauts', 'Octonauts', 'newest', 'DVD', 'release', 'titled', 'Calling', 'Sharks', 'learn', 'three', 'different', 'types', 'sharks', 'as', 'well', 'comb', 'jelly', 'pilot', 'fish', 'porcupine', 'puffer', 'show', 'so', 'wonderful', 'kids', 'creatures', 'might', 'otherwise', 'be', 'unaware', 'instance', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'cookiecutter', 'dwarf', 'latern', 'shark', 'prior', 'watching', 'episodes', 'series', 'so', 'good', 'using', 'comedic', 'situations', 'get', 'kids', 'laughing', 'learning', 'boys', 'ages', '2', '6', '7', 'thought', 'Giant', 'Jelly', 'episode', 'was', 'hilarious', 'show', 'song', 'conclusion', 'episode', 'called', 'creature', 'report', 'where', 'few', 'interesting', 'facts', 'were', 'covered', 'episode', 'are', 'put', 'musical', 'form', 'sort', 'review', 'DVD', 'running', 'time', 'approximately', '70', 'minutes', 'kids', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'big', 'fans', 'WordWorld', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'there', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'educational', 'children', 'show', 'could', 'measure', 'up', 'caliber', 'clever', 'Then', 'came', 'Octonauts', ""'m"", 'not', 'comparing', 'two', 'teach', 'same', 'subject', 'matter-', 'WordWorld', 'teaches', 'phonics/spelling', 'Octonauts', 'science', 'However', ""'re"", 'very', 'much', 'alike', 'have', 'very', 'entertaining', 'clever', 'way', 'combining', 'learning', 'fun', 'series', 'definitely', 'new', 'favorite', 'house', 'are', 'already', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'next', 'Octonauts', 'DVD', 'release']",Octonauts - Calling all Sharks!
