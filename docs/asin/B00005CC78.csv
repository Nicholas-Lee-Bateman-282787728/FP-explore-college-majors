581727,A158DLPKI1UKSL,B00005CC78,Sierra,"[6, 7]","I watched RG Veda on VHS over 7 years ago, and it was one of the first anime I had ever seen.  I remember going back to my video store and renting it again and again because it was so good.  RG Veda is a fantasy anime what had enormous potential to be a great series, but sadly was cut short (Does anyone know why that happened?).The animation was gorgeous, as is to be expected from the people at CLAMP.  The story was original and entertaining.  The story had 4 main characters, a princess, a prince, a king and a queen from 4 different realms, and each with extraordinary abilities.  They joined forces to fight a common enemy that was threatening their respective kingdoms (I'm sorry I can't remember more.  It has been years since I have watched this).  The action is terrific and the voice acting (Japanese) was supberb.Like other reviewers have stated it is sad that RG Veda is so short and obviously unfinished.  I really believe this one could have been a fantastic series.  If some of you remember, the same thing happened to the Guyver series although it did get considerably further than RG Veda in epsiodes.  It's very short, but it is sweet.  Hopefully there is a manga out there of this series so that those of us that have watched this can continue on with the books.",5,What a shame it was incomplete :(,1116460800,"05 19, 2005",2005,1283,"['watched', 'RG', 'Veda', 'VHS', '7', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'anime', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'remember', 'going', 'back', 'video', 'store', 'renting', 'again', 'again', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'RG', 'Veda', 'fantasy', 'anime', 'what', 'had', 'enormous', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'series', 'sadly', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'Does', 'anyone', 'know', 'why', 'happened', '.The', 'animation', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'be', 'expected', 'people', 'CLAMP', 'story', 'was', 'original', 'entertaining', 'story', 'had', '4', 'main', 'characters', 'princess', 'prince', 'king', 'queen', '4', 'different', 'realms', 'extraordinary', 'abilities', 'joined', 'forces', 'fight', 'common', 'enemy', 'was', 'threatening', 'respective', 'kingdoms', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'more', 'been', 'years', 'have', 'watched', 'action', 'terrific', 'voice', 'acting', 'Japanese', 'was', 'supberb.Like', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'sad', 'RG', 'Veda', 'so', 'short', 'obviously', 'unfinished', 'really', 'believe', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic', 'series', 'remember', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'Guyver', 'series', 'did', 'get', 'considerably', 'further', 'RG', 'Veda', 'epsiodes', 'very', 'short', 'sweet', 'Hopefully', 'manga', 'there', 'series', 'have', 'watched', 'can', 'continue', 'books']",N/A
