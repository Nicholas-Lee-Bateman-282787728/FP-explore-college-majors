The first is that it shows some of the methods that McCarthy used to interrogate his victims. I also found it funny that, when asked about things that had nothing to do with it, McCarthy would start spouting long speeches about Communism . The second is that it SHOWS people. You can really get a sense of what these people were like. You can see Roy Cohn right there in person, pouting like a 5-year-old kid. You can see some of the heads of the Committee, and see their obvious hatred of McCarthy and Cohn. You can see McCarthy, in all his ugliness, with that looong waaaay of speeeaking. You can actually get a picture of these people, and see how they work, and form your own opinions about them, instead of reading someone else's in a book. The third reason is that it just shows the hearings. If this movie were made today, you'd have all these &quot;historians&quot; talking in serious tones about the hearings. Here, the hearings speak for themselves. The people are not interupted, and no expert on McCarthyism appears to discuss what just went on. I think that is priceless My personal favorite: Welch, who, while very funny, managed to outsmart McCarthy various times.

184805,A3TTKOX35PVLTU,1567301649,"cameron-vale ""cameron-vale""","[13, 15]","POINT OF ORDER is an absolutely fascinating and unbiased filmed record of the long delayed downfall of Joe McCarthy, inarguably one of this country's most infamous modern villains.  Director Emile De Antonio licensed over 200 hours of footage from CBS-TV of the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings, which had been originally broadcast live to millions of spellbound viewers, and judiciously edited/condensed the dramatic events into 97 stunning minutes.  Its an incredible and important historical document that absolutely must be seen by anyone who wants to fully understand exactly why McCarthy was such a notorious figure.De Antonio refused to impose any narration to the film as he felt it was important to simply present the original provided camera coverage in as politically neutral a way as possible, without any editorializing whatsoever.  Indeed, no voiceover is needed at all to enhance the powerful drama of watching McCarthy, an abrasively loud and sarcastic demagogue and rabble rouser, slowly  transform into a ruined, disgraced alcoholic left alone to babble to himself.  Although his repulsive witch hunting campaign had been allowed to thrive for far too long, it must be said that justice against this truly immoral man finally triumphed.POINT OF ORDER is one of the greatest documentaries ever made and this DVD gives it a fine presentation.  New Yorker's discs have often (and justifiably) been attacked for substandard quality but this release is undeniably excellent, with surprising visual clarity considering the kinescope origins of the footage.  De Antonio's audio commentary (taken from a variety of recorded sources) provides information regarding the making of the film, as well as offering a comprehensive overview of the era.  Anybody with an interest in U.S. history should add this now-classic film to his or her DVD collection.",5,"Classic, Revelatory Documentary",1133827200,"12 6, 2005",2005,1854,"['POINT', 'OF', 'ORDER', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'unbiased', 'filmed', 'record', 'long', 'delayed', 'downfall', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'inarguably', 'one', 'country', 'most', 'infamous', 'modern', 'villains', 'Director', 'Emile', 'De', 'Antonio', 'licensed', '200', 'hours', 'footage', 'CBS-TV', '1954', 'Army-McCarthy', 'hearings', 'had', 'been', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'live', 'millions', 'spellbound', 'viewers', 'judiciously', 'edited/condensed', 'dramatic', 'events', '97', 'stunning', 'minutes', 'incredible', 'important', 'historical', 'document', 'absolutely', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'anyone', 'who', 'fully', 'understand', 'exactly', 'why', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'such', 'notorious', 'figure.De', 'Antonio', 'refused', 'impose', 'narration', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'important', 'simply', 'present', 'original', 'provided', 'camera', 'coverage', 'politically', 'neutral', 'way', 'possible', 'editorializing', 'whatsoever', 'Indeed', 'voiceover', 'needed', 'enhance', 'powerful', 'drama', 'watching', 'McCarthy', 'abrasively', 'loud', 'sarcastic', 'demagogue', 'rabble', 'rouser', 'slowly', 'transform', 'ruined', 'disgraced', 'alcoholic', 'left', 'alone', 'babble', 'repulsive', 'witch', 'hunting', 'campaign', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'thrive', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'justice', 'truly', 'immoral', 'man', 'finally', 'triumphed.POINT', 'OF', 'ORDER', 'one', 'greatest', 'documentaries', 'ever', 'made', 'DVD', 'fine', 'presentation', 'New', 'Yorker', 'discs', 'have', 'often', 'justifiably', 'been', 'attacked', 'substandard', 'quality', 'release', 'undeniably', 'excellent', 'surprising', 'visual', 'clarity', 'considering', 'kinescope', 'footage', 'De', 'Antonio', 'audio', 'commentary', 'taken', 'variety', 'recorded', 'sources', 'information', 'regarding', 'making', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'offering', 'comprehensive', 'overview', 'era', 'Anybody', 'interest', 'U.S.', 'history', 'should', 'add', 'now-classic', 'film', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

Wilson references the Venona project, an intelligence operation that identified numerous Communist undercover agents in the Federal government.  While it is true that several of the people Joseph McCarthy accused were also named in the Verona files (made public in 1995), many more were perfectly innocent, loyal Americans.  Furthermore, McCarthy was never able to produce a single shred of credible evidence to prove his accusations, and not one person who appeared before his committee was ever convicted of Soviet espionage.In other words, just because McCarthy may at times have been right, does not change (or justify) the fact that he was a bully, a demagogue, and an opportunist who ruined the  lives of numerous innocent Americans, who did far more harm than he did good, who was a disgrace to the Senate and the country, and who in the long run helped the Soviets with his reckless accusations far more than he hindered them.The film shows a signal moment in our nation's history, when television became the dominant force in American politics.  McCarthy's Red-baiting histrionics played well as newspaper headlines and quotes.  But when the unblinking eye of television showed him in the flesh, slinging mud in all directions, calling anyone who dared to disagree with him a liar or a fraud or a phony or a Communist sympathizer, he was finished.  McCarthy wasn't laid low by Joseph Welsh or Ed Murrow; he was destroyed by TV itself.I deduct one star from my rating because of the film's somewhat deceptive ending, which uses editing to make it appear as though the hearing room empties while McCarthy continues to rant.  In truth the hearings did not end this way, and this sequence plays like a steal from climax of ""Inherit the Wind.""",4,About the Venona decrypts...,1135468800,"12 25, 2005",2005,1822,"['critique', 'elsewhere', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'Fredrick', 'P.', 'Wilson', 'Venona', 'project', 'intelligence', 'operation', 'identified', 'numerous', 'Communist', 'undercover', 'agents', 'Federal', 'government', 'true', 'several', 'people', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'accused', 'were', 'also', 'named', 'Verona', 'files', 'made', 'public', '1995', 'many', 'more', 'were', 'perfectly', 'innocent', 'loyal', 'Americans', 'Furthermore', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'produce', 'single', 'shred', 'credible', 'evidence', 'prove', 'accusations', 'not', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'appeared', 'committee', 'was', 'ever', 'convicted', 'Soviet', 'espionage.In', 'other', 'words', 'just', 'McCarthy', 'may', 'times', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'not', 'change', 'justify', 'fact', 'was', 'bully', 'demagogue', 'opportunist', 'who', 'ruined', 'lives', 'numerous', 'innocent', 'Americans', 'who', 'did', 'far', 'more', 'harm', 'did', 'good', 'who', 'was', 'disgrace', 'Senate', 'country', 'who', 'long', 'run', 'helped', 'Soviets', 'reckless', 'accusations', 'far', 'more', 'hindered', 'them.The', 'film', 'signal', 'moment', 'nation', 'history', 'when', 'television', 'became', 'dominant', 'force', 'American', 'politics', 'McCarthy', 'Red-baiting', 'histrionics', 'played', 'well', 'newspaper', 'headlines', 'quotes', 'when', 'unblinking', 'eye', 'television', 'showed', 'flesh', 'slinging', 'mud', 'directions', 'calling', 'anyone', 'who', 'dared', 'disagree', 'liar', 'fraud', 'phony', 'Communist', 'sympathizer', 'was', 'finished', 'McCarthy', 'was', ""n't"", 'laid', 'low', 'Joseph', 'Welsh', 'Ed', 'Murrow', 'was', 'destroyed', 'TV', 'itself.I', 'deduct', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'film', 'somewhat', 'deceptive', 'ending', 'editing', 'make', 'appear', 'hearing', 'room', 'empties', 'McCarthy', 'rant', 'truth', 'hearings', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'way', 'sequence', 'steal', 'climax', 'Inherit', 'Wind']",N/A

No! And if Fisher went to any other Law Firm,he would bcome that firm's prize catch-He ""helped bring down McCarthy"".The reasons these hearings caused the ""downfall"" of McCarthy was because ""The Establishment"",wanted McCarthy to be cut down to size,they wanted him brought down because he was getting to big for his britches,and he had SEVERED his purpose in getting the American public in tune with the ""Red Menace"" and getting a certain segment of the population to equate ""liberalism(any leftism -which really doesn't have to be that far left or left at all)) with Communism"".Senator Joseph McCarthy died in 1957,but McCarthyism did not die,to this day Conservatives in particular like to question American citizens loyality whenever that citizen/or citizens question the motives,methods, or deeds of the U.S. Government or of business,especially so-called ""Big Business"".An excellent documentary  5 Stars",5,McCARTTHY 'SDOWNFALL-BUT NOT OF McCARTHYISM!,1151539200,"06 29, 2006",2006,2439,"['DVD', 'documentary', 'taken', 'kinescopes', 'pre-video-tape', 'tapes', 'key', 'moments', 'Army-MCCarthy', 'hearings', 'took', 'place', '1954.Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'R-Wis.', 'had', 'made', 'quite', 'name', 'accussing', 'almost', 'liberal', 'not', 'so', 'liberal', 'politician', 'pundit', 'high-brow', 'intellectual', 'being', 'Red', 'way', 'being', 'ally', 'Uncle', 'Jo', 'Stalin', 'Kremlin.When', 'accussed', 'U', 'S.Army', 'deliberately', 'hiding', 'subversives', 'was', 'act', 'sealed', 'fate.The', 'highlight', 'documentary', 'confrontation', 'McCarthy', 'chief', 'counsel', 'Army', 'Joseph', 'Welch', 'later', 'gain', 'even', 'more', 'fame', 'Judge', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'Anatomy', 'Murder', 'McCarthy', 'much', 'goating', 'Welch', 'cool', 'up', 'membership', 'National', 'Lawyers', 'Guild', 'cited', 'subversive', 'Attorney', 'General', 'control', 'American', 'Communist', 'Party', 'Welch', 'young', 'associate', 'Fred', 'Fisher.Indeed', 'Welch', 'admitted', 'Young', 'Republican', 'Fisher', 'Law', 'School', 'was', 'time', 'member', 'Guild', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'NLG', 'was', 'AG', 'list', 'resigned', 'membership', 'organization.For', 'outrage', 'exposing', 'Fisher', 'Welch', 'ripped', 'Senator', 'Joe', 'confrontation', 'eventually', 'led', 'McCarthy', 'censure', 'U.S.Senate', 'early', 'death', 'aided', 'excessive', 'drinking', 'Senator.My', 'only', 'question', 'Why', 'did', 'political', 'outing', 'Fisher', 'cause', 'fuss', 'former', 'Guild', 'membership', 'was', 'Welch', 'going', 'fire', 'No', 'Fisher', 'went', 'other', 'Law', 'Firm', 'would', 'bcome', 'firm', 'prize', 'catch-He', 'helped', 'bring', 'down', 'McCarthy', '.The', 'reasons', 'hearings', 'caused', 'downfall', 'McCarthy', 'was', 'Establishment', 'wanted', 'McCarthy', 'be', 'cut', 'down', 'size', 'wanted', 'brought', 'down', 'was', 'getting', 'big', 'britches', 'had', 'SEVERED', 'purpose', 'getting', 'American', 'public', 'tune', 'Red', 'Menace', 'getting', 'certain', 'segment', 'population', 'equate', 'liberalism', 'leftism', '-which', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'far', 'left', 'left', 'Communism', '.Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'died', '1957', 'McCarthyism', 'did', 'not', 'die', 'day', 'Conservatives', 'particular', 'question', 'American', 'citizens', 'loyality', 'whenever', 'citizen/or', 'question', 'motives', 'methods', 'deeds', 'U.S.', 'Government', 'business', 'especially', 'so-called', 'Big', 'Business', 'excellent', 'documentary', '5', 'Stars']",N/A

184812,A16QODENBJVUI1,1567301649,Robert Moore,"[2, 4]","This is absolutely essential viewing for understanding the hearings that saw the downfall of Joseph McCarthy.  The hearings were concerned to investigate accusations that McCarthy's aide Roy Cohn had pressured the army to give preferential treatment to Private G. David Schine, a former McCarthy.  The larger context had been the bullying, aggressive, and abusive tactics employed by McCarthy in making widespread, generally ill-informed, and self-serving accusations of a widespread communist conspiracy.  There is no question that there were Soviet spies in the U.S. government, a fact proven by the opening of the Soviet archives after the collapse of the USSR.  McCarthy's specific accusations, however, were almost always incorrect (or, rather, occasionally correct because he made such a vast number of accusations -- his actual batting percentage was actually dreadfully low).  McCarthy was one of the foremost practitioners of what Richard Hofstadter dubbed ""The Paranoid Style of American Politics,"" a tendency that is as alive today in American political life as ever (witness Anne Coulter's utterly absurd defense of McCarthy -- though I frankly belief that Coulter doesn't really believe what she says about McCarthy, but instead says what she says to sell books; in short, she is playing a role). Eisenhower thought McCarthy a complete idiot, but refused to intervene early on to shut him up, afraid of alienating many in his base.  It was difficult for anyone disagreeing with McCarthy to say so for fear of being accused of being a Communist.  Accusing him of pulling strings for a private for preferential treatment, in short abusing his office to benefit a single private, was a safer way of defanging the snake.There are many memorable moments.  There is a brilliant exchange between the brilliant Joseph Welch and Roy Cohn. Welch, of course, would utter some of the most famous words in American history when in an exchange he says to McCarthy (in response to McCarthy's accusation that a lawyer in Welch's firm was a Communist), ""You've done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?""  These words, combined with Edward R. Murrow's famous salvo against McCarthy on national television, probably did more to end McCarthy's reign of error than anything.  The discussions in the hearings danced around issues of homosexuality without bluntly discussing them.  Although the exact details of the relationship between Roy Cohn and Schine is known, many have speculated that they may have had a sexual relationship.  Some have even suggested that McCarthy was homosexual, but this has always struck me purely speculative, whereas Cohn's homosexuality (he was one of first famous Americans to die of AIDS, though he denied until the end of his illness that he was suffering from AIDS or that he was gay) is well documented.  Certainly Cohn and Schine were very close, though it is quite possible that it was Platonic.One great moment is when McCarthy reveals a letter purportedly from J. Edgar Hoover that would have helped McCarthy's case.  Welch insists on having McCarthy's office on commenting on the validity of the letter and it is revealed that Hoover did not write it at all, the obvious conclusion being that McCarthy simply fabricated it.  McCarthy denied this, standing behind his insistence that he would not endanger his source by revealing how he got the ""Hoover"" letter.The most dramatic moment comes when the committee walks out on McCarthy when he avoids answering a question by counter accusations.  As everyone walks out McCarthy continues to drone on and on.  It was effectively the end of his career.  He would soon be censured by the U.S. Senate and while he served out the last two years of his term he was finished as a force in American politics.  Long a serious alcoholic, he would drink himself to death within three years of these hearings.As a native of Arkansas and a graduate of the John L. McClellan High School in Little Rock, I want to express how proud I was of McClellan in these hearings (with Bobby Kennedy sitting directly behind him, who McClellan had hired as counsel for investigation of organized crime).  Although McClellan had many major contributions to the senate in his long tenure of office, he rarely did as well as in these hearings, with his obvious disgust and disdain for McCarthy.  (I would like to add that McClellan and Fulbright provided Arkansas with absolutely splendid representation in the Senate, just the great Joseph Robinson, who was the Senator Majority Leader during FDR's first term and oversaw the passing of the New Deal, before them and as Dale Bumpers and David Pryor did later, which makes the current performance of the embarrassing Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor all the more shameful.  I also by an enormous coincidence had McClellan speak at both my high school and college graduation ceremonies.)",5,An essential document in American history,1266105600,"02 14,

184813,A1LTJCQGRPTOTD,1567301649,STEPHEN T. McCARTHY,"[7, 9]","The Army-McCarthy hearings in which the demagogic Senator, Joseph McCarthy, and his chief counsel, Roy Cohn, were charged with having attempted to blackmail special treatment from the Army for their partner-in-crime, Private David G. Schine, took a total of 36 days.  That's an awful lot of testimony, and it captured the attention of the American public like nothing before.  It would be nearly four decades before the O.J. Simpson trial would equal its theatrics and stir up equal or greater interest among the people.POINT OF ORDER is a distillation of those 36 days that rocked America, it is a great ninety-seven minute movie, an exceptionally well-constructed documentary in which producer and editor, Emile de Antonio, painstakingly pored over all of the testimony given in the Army-McCarthy Hearings and from that massive collection of old TV kinescopes, he assembled a picture that shall forever stand as an indictment and proof of Senator Joseph McCarthy's shameful acts, his wicked calumny.  Emile de Antonio has selected particular segments of the hearings in order to show McCarthy in his worst light and to expose him as the liar and slanderer that he was; a man who recklessly smeared the reputations of countless innocent Americans, dogging them with false accusations of Communistic involvement, who in the process, created a ""Red Scare"" in this country that had decent Americans in government and the entertainment industry in fear.  No one could be sure who McCarthy would falsely accuse next, and as a result, the American people became fearful of their friends and family members, fearful of all of their associations.The era of ""McCarthyism"" was one of the worst in American history, and when it became clear that the malicious McCarthy had to be stopped, the Army Hearings brought attention to the man's irrational behavior, and shortly afterwards, censure charges were brought against him in the Senate, and his own colleagues found him guilty of acts ""contrary to senatorial tradition.""  The evil had finally been confronted and conquered!Emile de Antonio's masterful editing in POINT OF ORDER gets right to the heart of the matter; utilizing clips of McCarthy's worst behavior during the Army-McCarthy Hearings, it puts on full display the malevolence that was Senator McCarthy.  The big highlight of the proceedings is when the lawyer, Joe Welch, indignantly asks McCarthy, ""Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last?  Have you left no sense of decency?""  The lawyer's question for the senator finally shows who the real enemy is.  All Americans should see this documentary and learn the truth about Senator McCarthy, so that an informed vigilance will prevent any future ""McCarthys"" from terrorizing the country we love.",5,MASTERFULLY EDITED TO MAGNIFY McCARTHY'S MALEVOLENCE,1179705600,"05 21, 2007",2007,2754,"['Army-McCarthy', 'hearings', 'demagogic', 'Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'chief', 'counsel', 'Roy', 'Cohn', 'were', 'charged', 'having', 'attempted', 'blackmail', 'special', 'treatment', 'Army', 'partner-in-crime', 'Private', 'David', 'G.', 'Schine', 'took', 'total', '36', 'days', 'awful', 'lot', 'testimony', 'captured', 'attention', 'American', 'public', 'nothing', 'would', 'be', 'nearly', 'four', 'decades', 'O.J', 'Simpson', 'trial', 'would', 'equal', 'theatrics', 'stir', 'up', 'equal', 'greater', 'interest', 'people.POINT', 'OF', 'ORDER', 'distillation', '36', 'days', 'rocked', 'America', 'great', 'ninety-seven', 'minute', 'movie', 'exceptionally', 'well-constructed', 'documentary', 'producer', 'editor', 'Emile', 'de', 'Antonio', 'painstakingly', 'pored', 'testimony', 'given', 'Army-McCarthy', 'Hearings', 'massive', 'collection', 'old', 'TV', 'kinescopes', 'assembled', 'picture', 'shall', 'forever', 'stand', 'indictment', 'proof', 'Senator', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'shameful', 'acts', 'wicked', 'calumny', 'Emile', 'de', 'Antonio', 'selected', 'particular', 'segments', 'hearings', 'order', 'show', 'McCarthy', 'worst', 'light', 'expose', 'liar', 'slanderer', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'recklessly', 'smeared', 'reputations', 'countless', 'innocent', 'Americans', 'dogging', 'false', 'accusations', 'Communistic', 'involvement', 'who', 'process', 'created', 'Red', 'Scare', 'country', 'had', 'decent', 'Americans', 'government', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'fear', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'sure', 'who', 'McCarthy', 'would', 'falsely', 'accuse', 'next', 'result', 'American', 'people', 'became', 'fearful', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'fearful', 'associations.The', 'era', 'McCarthyism', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'American', 'history', 'when', 'became', 'clear', 'malicious', 'McCarthy', 'had', 'be', 'stopped', 'Army', 'Hearings', 'brought', 'attention', 'man', 'irrational', 'behavior', 'shortly', 'afterwards', 'censure', 'charges', 'were', 'brought', 'Senate', 'own', 'colleagues', 'found', 'guilty', 'acts', 'contrary', 'senatorial', 'tradition', 'evil', 'had', 'finally', 'been', 'confronted', 'conquered', 'Emile', 'Antonio', 'masterful', 'editing', 'POINT', 'OF', 'ORDER', 'right', 'heart', 'matter', 'utilizing', 'clips', 'McCarthy', 'worst', 'behavior', 'Army-McCarthy', 'Hearings', 'full', 'display', 'malevolence', 'was', 'Senator', 'McCarthy', 'big', 'highlight', 'proceedings', 'when', 'lawyer', 'Joe', 'Welch', 'indignantly', 'McCarthy', 'Have', 'sense', 'decency', 'sir', 'long', 'last', 'Have', 'left', 'sense', 'decency', 'lawyer', 'question', 'senator', 'finally', 'who', 'real', 'enemy', 'Americans', 'should', 'see', 'documentary', 'learn', 'truth', 'Senator', 'McCarthy', 'informed', 'vigilance', 'will', 'prevent', 'future', 'McCarthys', 'terrorizing', 'country', 'love']",N/A
