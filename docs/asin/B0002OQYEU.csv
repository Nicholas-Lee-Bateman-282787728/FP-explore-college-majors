842281,ASS5YMGBL164,B0002OQYEU,"albabe ""The Writer/Artist Formally Known as A...","[66, 67]","I'm a huge fan of Norther Exposure.I think it's one of the BEST TV series EVER produced... which is why it's very hard for me to say that NO ONE should waste there hard-earned moolah on this DVD set!This morning I started to check the Northern Exposure Syndicated episodes I taped off the TV, against the new second season DVD box set... Very disappointing.  So much so that I got 10 minutes and three songs into the first episode and had to stop.As an example:  The first song - during the teaser on my Syndicated version - is a beautiful trumpet-arranged version of Stardust over a monologue by Chris (Harry James maybe?).  It's the first thing you hear and it sets a very important mood for the episode...  and it's no longer there for anyone to appreciate.  The song on the DVD Box Set is something completely forgettable.More so than anything else I can think of, the music on Northern Exposure is integral to the series.  When it's used well - which is almost always - it is a profound voice in the series, and almost always a ""character"" of it's own.  Most of the time the music tells a significant part of the story besides setting a mood for the scene.  There are a lot of levels to Northern Exposure.  Things like Shelly's earrings and their metaphoric relationship to the storyline contribute to the feel of each episode.  Worse, without the original music, we aren't seeing the shows we remember.My own experience with licensors is that they're a very short-sighted, ignorant and greedy bunch of bad businessmen.  They don't seem to take into account how many more copies of, say, Etta James' version of ""At Last,"" they'd sell every time the show is rerun or watched on home video.The odd thing is that the price of the first and second season are almost the same.  BUT the first season has the original music*... so it seems to me that we are already paying for their licensing fees.It'd be nice if we could let the Producers of the DVD sets know that we'd pay more for the real music.  I definitely would.  I already have.The show has hole big enough to float a Love Boat through it without the original/correct music.My advise to fans, is to tape the episodes off the TV since they have the original music.  I'd rather have an edited, grainy version than an episode with forgettable/unoriginal music.My advise to the Producers is to have a disclaimer on the package saying that these episodes are NOT COMPLETE!!!  Shame on you.  And in the future please let us buyers know if the music is complete or not... as I won't waste my money on incomplete episodes.peace,albabe(*As far as I can tell, the first season DVD set has the original music - but  I only have the syndicated-shorter episodes to compare them to, as opposed to the first run-complete ones.)update 12-31-04  Happy New Year!!!It's obvious that Universal has got it's few hacks to make positive note here in the Amazon Reviews of their soulless Northern Exposure DVD set for season #2.  Anyone who is a NX fan that doesn't think the music is as important as the actors, et al, is either somewhat vacant or a fibber... or maybe just not a music fan.I've been watching these episodes over and over again since shortly after their inception on Network TV. These wonderful - read: full of wonder - episodes helped me through the death of my Brother and Mother. The metaphors are that strong. And I know the music by heart... maybe that's why Season 2 is such a disappointment.Universal has the gall to charge as much for the second season - with one-less episode and very little original music - as for the first season, which is complete and, as far as I can tell, pretty much the same as broadcast.(...)",1,Soulless Disapointment - Original Music MISSING!!!,1103241600,"12 17, 2004",2004,3678,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Norther', 'Exposure.I', 'think', 'one', 'BEST', 'TV', 'series', 'EVER', 'produced', 'why', 'very', 'hard', 'say', 'ONE', 'should', 'waste', 'hard-earned', 'moolah', 'DVD', 'set', 'morning', 'started', 'check', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'Syndicated', 'taped', 'off', 'TV', 'new', 'second', 'season', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'Very', 'disappointing', 'So', 'much', 'got', '10', 'minutes', 'three', 'songs', 'first', 'episode', 'had', 'stop.As', 'example', 'first', 'song', 'teaser', 'Syndicated', 'version', 'beautiful', 'trumpet-arranged', 'version', 'Stardust', 'monologue', 'Chris', 'Harry', 'James', 'maybe', 'first', 'thing', 'hear', 'very', 'important', 'mood', 'episode', 'no', 'longer', 'there', 'anyone', 'appreciate', 'song', 'DVD', 'Box', 'Set', 'something', 'completely', 'forgettable.More', 'so', 'anything', 'else', 'can', 'think', 'music', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'integral', 'series', 'When', 'used', 'well', 'almost', 'always', 'profound', 'voice', 'series', 'almost', 'always', 'character', 'own', 'Most', 'time', 'music', 'significant', 'part', 'story', 'setting', 'mood', 'scene', 'are', 'lot', 'levels', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'Things', 'Shelly', 'earrings', 'metaphoric', 'relationship', 'storyline', 'contribute', 'feel', 'episode', 'Worse', 'original', 'music', 'are', ""n't"", 'seeing', 'shows', 'remember.My', 'own', 'experience', 'licensors', ""'re"", 'very', 'short-sighted', 'ignorant', 'greedy', 'bunch', 'bad', 'businessmen', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'take', 'account', 'how', 'many', 'more', 'copies', 'say', 'Etta', 'James', 'version', 'Last', ""'d"", 'sell', 'time', 'show', 'rerun', 'watched', 'home', 'video.The', 'odd', 'thing', 'price', 'first', 'second', 'season', 'are', 'almost', 'same', 'BUT', 'first', 'season', 'original', 'music*', 'are', 'already', 'paying', 'licensing', 'fees.It', ""'d"", 'be', 'nice', 'could', 'let', 'Producers', 'DVD', 'sets', 'know', ""'d"", 'pay', 'more', 'real', 'music', 'definitely', 'would', 'already', 'have.The', 'show', 'hole', 'big', 'enough', 'float', 'Love', 'Boat', 'original/correct', 'music.My', 'advise', 'fans', 'tape', 'episodes', 'TV', 'have', 'original', 'music', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'edited', 'grainy', 'version', 'episode', 'forgettable/unoriginal', 'music.My', 'advise', 'Producers', 'have', 'disclaimer', 'package', 'saying', 'episodes', 'are', 'NOT', 'COMPLETE', 'Shame', 'future', 'please', 'let', 'buyers', 'know', 'music', 'complete', 'not', 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'incomplete', 'episodes.peace', 'albabe', '*As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'original', 'music', 'only', 'have', 'syndicated-shorter', 'episodes', 'compare', 'opposed', 'first', 'run-complete', 'ones', 'update', '12-31-04', 'Happy', 'New', 'Year', 'obvious', 'Universal', 'got', 'few', 'hacks', 'make', 'positive', 'note', 'here', 'Amazon', 'Reviews', 'soulless', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'DVD', 'set', 'season', '2', 'Anyone', 'who', 'NX', 'fan', ""n't"", 'think', 'music', 'as', 'important', 'actors', 'et', 'al', 'somewhat', 'vacant', 'fibber', 'maybe', 'just', 'not', 'music', 'fan.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'episodes', 'over', 'again', 'shortly', 'inception', 'Network', 'TV', 'wonderful', 'read', 'full', 'wonder', 'episodes', 'helped', 'death', 'Brother', 'Mother', 'metaphors', 'are', 'strong', 'know', 'music', 'heart', 'maybe', 'why', 'Season', '2', 'such', 'disappointment.Universal', 'gall', 'charge', 'as', 'much', 'second', 'season', 'one-less', 'episode', 'very', 'little', 'original', 'music', 'first', 'season', 'complete', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'broadcast.']",N/A

I have the complete show on tapes so I didn't even bother buying the DVDs.There really is something about the NX show. Apart from its original characters, subtle humor, and strong (yet so simply and beautifully made) scripts. There is something special, something refreshing and healthy. It's definitely unlike anything I've seen on TV. Although I have to say I kind of lost interest toward the end (last two series). The show just started to try too hard when it simply didn't have much more to offer. I think French philosopher Pascal said it (early Chris would agree on this one I am sure) - All the things are at their best in the beginnings. Anyway, I would like to congratulate the authors of the show, they made the best TV thing to come out of the USA. Ever. This might not seem like such a special feat, with all the market-driven, shiny-executed and here-comes-the-moral-lesson garbage America is flushing itself and rest of the World with. OK, sometimes there have been some good moments. I mean, Twin Peaks was quirky. The LA Law was sound and funny. Also liked Ally McBeal show although at times it was a bit thin and boring.But Northern Exposure... The NX show is the only thing with what could be called the upside-down structure. All the standard ingredients are there - crisp scripting, funny and original characters, witty one-liners, idealized picture of a small town life. And there's a captivatingly virgin and larger-than-life Alaska (Canada, actually) nature. But where all the other shows think that's enough to make a solid and enjoyable thing which will draw the audience, the NX only begins. In each episode (at least in the early ones) there's a beautiful thought hidden, lying there like a priceless piece of jewelry, just waiting for somebody (in this case a viewer) to pick it up. And that's more important than all the above mentioned standard ingredients.And than there's the obligatory moral lesson. But this show is not preaching. It's not heavy. And it's not shallow and pathetic. It doesn't try to sell anything because it knows better. You only have what you give away. More I think about it more it seems that America just made the ode to its best self. Walt Whitman meets Woody Allen.Enough said, let Maurice, that most American of the characters, have the last word - We came to Alaska with nothing more than a dream and capital investment. We came here to live large, breath free. And, by God, we did it.It may only be a TV show, but it's still larger than life.",5,Walt meets Woody,1094428800,"09 6, 2004",2004,2543,"['comment', 'purely', 'show', 'have', 'complete', 'show', 'tapes', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'buying', 'DVDs.There', 'really', 'something', 'NX', 'show', 'Apart', 'original', 'characters', 'subtle', 'humor', 'strong', 'yet', 'so', 'simply', 'beautifully', 'made', 'scripts', 'something', 'special', 'something', 'refreshing', 'healthy', 'definitely', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'TV', 'have', 'say', 'kind', 'lost', 'interest', 'end', 'last', 'two', 'series', 'show', 'just', 'started', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'when', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'more', 'offer', 'think', 'French', 'philosopher', 'Pascal', 'said', 'early', 'Chris', 'would', 'agree', 'one', 'am', 'sure', 'things', 'are', 'best', 'beginnings', 'Anyway', 'would', 'like', 'congratulate', 'authors', 'show', 'made', 'best', 'TV', 'thing', 'come', 'USA', 'Ever', 'might', 'not', 'seem', 'special', 'feat', 'market-driven', 'shiny-executed', 'here-comes-the-moral-lesson', 'garbage', 'America', 'flushing', 'rest', 'World', 'OK', 'sometimes', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'moments', 'mean', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'was', 'quirky', 'LA', 'Law', 'was', 'sound', 'funny', 'Also', 'liked', 'Ally', 'McBeal', 'show', 'times', 'was', 'bit', 'thin', 'boring.But', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'NX', 'show', 'only', 'thing', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'upside-down', 'structure', 'standard', 'ingredients', 'are', 'there', 'crisp', 'scripting', 'funny', 'original', 'characters', 'witty', 'one-liners', 'idealized', 'picture', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'captivatingly', 'virgin', 'larger-than-life', 'Alaska', 'Canada', 'actually', 'nature', 'where', 'other', 'shows', 'think', 'enough', 'make', 'solid', 'enjoyable', 'thing', 'will', 'draw', 'audience', 'NX', 'only', 'episode', 'least', 'early', 'ones', 'beautiful', 'thought', 'hidden', 'lying', 'there', 'priceless', 'piece', 'jewelry', 'just', 'waiting', 'somebody', 'case', 'viewer', 'pick', 'up', 'more', 'important', 'above', 'mentioned', 'standard', 'ingredients.And', 'obligatory', 'moral', 'lesson', 'show', 'not', 'preaching', 'not', 'heavy', 'not', 'shallow', 'pathetic', ""n't"", 'try', 'sell', 'anything', 'better', 'only', 'have', 'what', 'give', 'away', 'More', 'think', 'more', 'America', 'just', 'made', 'ode', 'best', 'self', 'Walt', 'Whitman', 'Woody', 'Allen.Enough', 'said', 'let', 'Maurice', 'most', 'American', 'characters', 'have', 'last', 'word', 'came', 'Alaska', 'nothing', 'more', 'dream', 'capital', 'investment', 'came', 'here', 'live', 'large', 'breath', 'free', 'God', 'did', 'it.It', 'may', 'only', 'be', 'TV', 'show', 'still', 'larger', 'life']",N/A

Shows like ""Wonderfalls"" and ""Freaks and Geeks"" are dropped after a season or less because they don't live up to the network's high ratings expectations.""Northern Exposure"" was one of those quirky shows that did make it, but it took two shortened seasons to get it off the ground, the second of which is now available on DVD.This show debuted while I was still in high school, so I remember only bits of it from the later years, but I recall a funny show with a lot of great characters. I purchased the first season and was impressed with the presentation of the show, but the lack of episodes is a little strange. The first season contained eight episodes and the second season contained only seven. At more than 40 dollars in most retailers, that is a high price to pay. I wonder if the two seasons could've been put together into one solid release, but that's beside the point.The second season was just as good as the first, if one episode shorter. The characters continued their great development, as Dr. Joel Fleishman, the New York doctor transplant, recieved a Dear John letter from his fiancee, Maggie O'Connell, the beautiful bush pilot, lost another boyfriend to a strange accident, bringing back talk of her curse on men, Holling and Shelly, the 60+ bar owner and his very young ""almost bride"" were riddled with television addiction and crazy dreams and Ed, the young Indian, continued his pursuit of directing a movie.These unique characters all make up the town of Cicely, Alaska. In the second season, Dr. Joel continues to figure out more and more things about the people that make up this town that he has been relegated to.The show starred Rob Morrow as Dr. Joel and Barry Corbin as Maurice Minnfield, the rich former astronaut who seems to own everything in the small town. Janine Turner stars as Maggie, the pilot with a penchant for having boyfriends die. John Collum, who did a turn as Mark Greene's dying father on ""ER"" plays Holling, the local bar owner who fell in love with beauty contestant winner Shelly, played by Cynthia Geary. Darren E. Burrows plays Ed, the curious teenage Indian who always seems to be in the middle of the stories. John Corbett, who many know from Sex and the City, stars as Chris Stevens, the radio DJ.It is Corbett's character that provides a voice for this show. His voiceovers often start episodes and tie things together. His musings and thoughts on life fill the air of this small town, bringing a new level of sophistication, while dealing with small-town problems unique to the Alaskan wilderness. I found this character to be one of the best on the show, and the episode where he loses his voice at the sight of a beautiful woman provided one of the best episodes of the first two seasons. The acting involved in a non-speaking dialogue was great.This set is a must for a fan of the show, but for someone who may just want to see it, the high price for a small number of episodes may point toward a renting of the show first.A funny, quirky show that made it.

And, I'm beginning to understand others' gripes that the music is ignored. Perhaps there's a Web resourse that has cataloged some of the tunes used in the show. About the best and worst I can say for Northern Exposure -- the DVDs -- is that's it's a budget job, and it shows. I don't know who is scrimping, Universal or Fahley or some other. Still, the show's writers -- obviously well-read -- have made something just a little bit special, even if some of the show's charms have faded over the years.

842310,A24XXDV7WR70GN,B0002OQYEU,"MGA ""Mike""","[20, 28]","After watching the first season of Northern Exposure on DVD, buying the second season was a no-brainer. As many others have commented here, there is no other TV series quite like Northern Exposure for its intelligence, charm, spirituality, humor and atmosphere. It was incredible to think something like this actually made it to prime time, let alone to ever hope it would arrive on DVD. It did.Watching these episodes without commercials in crisp DVD format is simply like watching them for the first time. I have no problem with the price of this package at all; if you break it down per episode, it's about the same as buying a couple of movies. But this is much better than a couple of movies! I always say to my friends that Northern Exposure is not a series, it is a place.My only real gripe is the double-sided DVDs. Considering the incremental cost differential, which is minimal, there really is no excuse for this. It goes without saying that giving us 4 one-sided DVDs with artwork instead of 2 double-sided DVDs would have added to the lifespan of this product. I believe Universal does understand that Northern Exposure is a great product; but they simply do not understand it enough to respect it as a work of art. My suggestion: Lose the damn parka and don't do any more double-sided DVDs.Having said that, if you like Northern Exposure, then buy the second season. This vote will help ensure that we get to see all the rest of the episodes on DVD.",5,Best TV Show Ever,1101945600,"12 2, 2004",2004,1463,"['watching', 'first', 'season', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'DVD', 'buying', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'no-brainer', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'commented', 'here', 'other', 'TV', 'series', 'quite', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'intelligence', 'charm', 'spirituality', 'humor', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'incredible', 'think', 'something', 'actually', 'made', 'prime', 'time', 'let', 'alone', 'ever', 'hope', 'would', 'arrive', 'DVD', 'did.Watching', 'episodes', 'commercials', 'crisp', 'DVD', 'format', 'simply', 'like', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'problem', 'price', 'package', 'break', 'down', 'episode', 'same', 'buying', 'couple', 'movies', 'much', 'better', 'couple', 'movies', 'always', 'say', 'friends', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'not', 'series', 'place.My', 'only', 'real', 'gripe', 'double-sided', 'DVDs', 'Considering', 'incremental', 'cost', 'differential', 'minimal', 'really', 'excuse', 'saying', 'giving', '4', 'one-sided', 'DVDs', 'artwork', 'instead', '2', 'double-sided', 'DVDs', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'lifespan', 'product', 'believe', 'Universal', 'understand', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'great', 'product', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'enough', 'respect', 'work', 'art', 'suggestion', 'Lose', 'damn', 'parka', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'more', 'double-sided', 'DVDs.Having', 'said', 'like', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'then', 'buy', 'second', 'season', 'vote', 'will', 'help', 'ensure', 'get', 'see', 'rest', 'episodes', 'DVD']",N/A
842311,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B0002OQYEU,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[18, 24]","For six seasons between 1990 and 1995, television audiences were treated to a unique show called ""Northern Exposure"", whose premise revolved around a recently graduated NYC doctor named Dr. Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow). To pay for his medical school expenses, Dr. Fleischman entered a financial program created by the state of Alaska on the condition that he would practice medicine in Alaska upon graduation for a specified number of years. Begrudgingly, Dr. Fleischman travels to Alaska believing that he will be working in one of the major cities. Instead, he is required to work in the small and isolated fictional town of Cicely (filmed in the town of Roslyn, Washington), whose residents are rather quirky and which is owned and controlled primarily by a wealthy retired astronaut, Maurice J. Minnifield (Barry Corbin). Other residents of Cicely include Dr. Fleischman's assistant, Marilyn Whirlwind (Elaine Miles), the pilot Maggie O'Connell (Janine Turner), bar owner Holling Gustaf Vincoeur (John Cullum), his girlfriend Shelly Marie Tambo Vincoeur (Cynthia Geary), the somewhat nosy buy very friendly Edward 'Ed' Chigliak (Darren E. Burrows), store owner Ruth-Anne Miller (Peg Phillips, 1918-2002) and the town's favorite local radio DJ Christopher 'Chris' Stevens (John Corbett). Over the course of the series, a tense relationship develops between Dr. Fleischman and Maggie, Maggie's boyfriends continue to accidentally die off, Maurice fights his own inner demons and Dr. Fleischman slowly adjusts to life in untamed Alaska.Many people were not pleased when ""Northern Exposure"" was cancelled after its 1994-1995 season, but its 110 episodes are well worth watching. The short second season includes the seven following episodes:1. ""Goodbye to All That"".  After Joel receives a ""dear John"" letter from his girlfriend Elaine in NYC, Maggie tries to help him.  Holling's purchase of a satellite TV turns Shelly into a TV-addict.2. ""The Big Kiss"".  While Chris loses his voice after a beautiful woman visits Cicely, Ed gets advice from a 256-year-old Indian spirit named ""One-Who-Waits"" (Floyd ""Red Crow"" Westerman).3. ""All is Vanity"". While Holling contemplates getting circumcised to please Shelly, Maurice enlists the town's help to watch over the body an unknown man who died while waiting to see Joel at his office. Maggie also enlists Joel's help to pretend to be her boyfriend while her father (John McCann) visits.4. ""What I Did For Love"".  Joel worries about a planned visit to NYC after he learns about Maggie's dreams of him dying and isn't too happy with the over-enthusiastic doctor (Leo Geter) who comes to substitute while he's away.5. ""Spring Break"". Some people start to get cabin-fever as the imminent spring thaw is warming things up. The result: a few items are stolen that convince Maurice to ask for a sheriff's deputy to investigate.  Maurice can't help but be attracted to the deputy, who is a well-muscled woman boxer named Officer Barbara Semanski (Diane Delano).6. ""War and Peace"".  A famous Russian performer, Nikolai Ivanovich Apalanov (Elya Baskin), comes to visit Cicely a bit early; but he and Maurice don't get along very well.  Chris helps Ed attract a farm girl's heart while Holling is suffering from too many vivid dreams.7. ""Slow Dance"".  The O'Connell curse once again strikes as a wayward satellite burning up on re-entry falls onto Rick (Grant Goodeve) while he's out camping alone to deal with his anger with Maggie after she reported his colorblindness to the FAA resulting in the loss of his pilot's license.  In the meantime, Maurice finds buyers for one of his buildings.  They want to turn it into a bed & breakfast, but Maurice starts to have second thoughts when he finds out the buyers are a gay couple.""Northern Exposure"" was a truly wonderful show. The second season DVD set includes all seven episodes, as well as deleted scenes from each of the episodes. Unfortunately, the set is rather pricey and many people have not been happy with the fact that both sides of each DVD have been recorded.  Hence, my rating for the second season itself is 5 out of 5 stars, but my rating for the quality of packaging and price is only 3 stars.  Consequently, my overall rating is 4 out of 5 stars.  Following ""Northern Exposure"", John Corbett portrayed the character ""Ian Miller"" in the 2002 film ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and the character ""Aiden Shaw"" in several seasons of the HBO TV show ""Sex and the City"" (1998-2004).",4,"Joel's Breakup, TV, Breaking Ice, A Duel & The Satellite",1111449600,"03 22, 2005",2005,4474,"['six', 'seasons', '1990', '1995', 'television', 'audiences',

842313,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B0002OQYEU,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","The second season of Northern Exposure was another shortened one.  The first two seasons were almost like a mini series, with the first being 8 episodes and the second being 7.  Instead of combining the two seasons into one DVD release they were issued as individual sets, each having two double sided DVDs.  So basically there are two episodes on each side of both discs.  In the case of season 2, the fist disc has 2 episodes on each side, and the second has two episodes on side A and one on side B.As far as the big controversy with the music, I cannot say that I remember all the original songs in each episode.  I was in my teens when the show first came out, and honestly did not pay all that much attention to the music.  It seems however Universal has released a couple versions of the second season set.  If you can get a copy of the set that was originally released it has as, far as I can tell, all the original songs on it.  I bought mine the week it was released and there is no musak overdubbing on my version that I can tell.  From the complaints people have made it sounds like the copies that do have it are very noticeable.  If there are sets out there that have replaced Etta James's ""At Last"" in the final scene of the season finale when Joel and Maggie are dancing, that is not the case in my set.Universal most likely lost the rights to use the songs at some point, then had to make the choice of either not releasing the DVDs at all or releasing them with music overdubbed.  From what I can tell all the DVD sets from season 3 on had a lot of replacement music.  So if you are one who would absolutely hate the show without the original music, then either try to track down an older copy of season 2 or skip it all together.The reality of a lot of older shows that predated DVD.  They cannot just release the show with the original music without securing the rights to all the songs.  If they do they would face a major lawsuit.  Given that they used songs by many established artists in the show, getting the rights to some of them do not come cheap.  Which is why the sets were so expensive when seasons 1 and 2 were originally released.  Now yes the dubbed over music could just be Universal being cheap, or it could be the rights holders refusing to allow the music to be included at all. I fall into the camp that I will take having the show available on DVD, even an imperfect release, if that is all we are ever going to get.  It would be great if they put out a 25th anniversary complete series set with tons of bonus features, commentaries and all the original music.  Since that is not likely to come what is out now is the best we as fans of the show are going to get.Story wise the second season continued to focus on the fish-out-of water aspect to Joel being in the town.  He does start to acclimate somewhat, but still wants out.  The show also continued the build the love-hate relationship between Maggie and Joel and continued the sexual tension between them.  It also started to develop some of the ancillary characters and focusing more on the quirkiness of the town.As far as what is there for extra features, each episode has deleted and extended scenes, as well as unexposed footage which basically amounts to being a gag reel.  Each side of the disc has about 10-20 min of that kind of stuff.  There are no commentary tracks, or behind the scenes or making of features through.The show itself is 5 star.  The music will be a bigger issue for some people than others.  Since there is not likely to ever be a perfect release of the show, whether you get this or not will really depend on how much you are willing to give up to have it on DVD.",4,"Wonderful show, crappy DVD presentation",1400976000,"05 25, 2014",2014,3688,"['second', 'season', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'was', 'shortened', 'one', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'almost', 'mini', 'series', 'first', 'being', '8', 'episodes', 'second', 'being', '7', 'Instead', 'combining', 'two', 'seasons', 'one', 'DVD', 'release', 'were', 'issued', 'individual', 'sets', 'having', 'two', 'double', 'sided', 'DVDs', 'So', 'basically', 'are', 'two', 'episodes', 'side', 'discs', 'case', 'season', '2', 'fist', 'disc', '2', 'episodes', 'side', 'second', 'two', 'episodes', 'side', 'A', 'one', 'side', 'B.As', 'far', 'big', 'controversy', 'music', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'remember', 'original', 'songs', 'episode', 'was', 'teens', 'when', 'show', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'honestly', 'did', 'not', 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'music', 'however', 'Universal', 'released', 'couple', 'versions', 'second', 'season', 'set', 'can', 'get', 'copy', 'set', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'original', 'songs', 'bought', 'mine', 'week', 'was', 'released', 'musak', 'overdubbing', 'version', 'can', 'tell', 'complaints', 'people', 'have', 'made', 'copies', 'do', 'have', 'are', 'very', 'noticeable', 'are', 'sets', 'out', 'there', 'have', 'replaced', 'Etta', 'James', 'Last', 'final', 'scene', 'season', 'finale', 'when', 'Joel', 'Maggie', 'are', 'dancing', 'not', 'case', 'set.Universal', 'most', 'likely', 'lost', 'rights', 'use', 'songs', 'point', 'then', 'had', 'make', 'choice', 'not', 'releasing', 'DVDs', 'releasing', 'music', 'overdubbed', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'DVD', 'sets', 'season', '3', 'had', 'lot', 'replacement', 'music', 'So', 'are', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'show', 'original', 'music', 'then', 'try', 'track', 'down', 'older', 'copy', 'season', '2', 'skip', 'together.The', 'reality', 'lot', 'older', 'shows', 'predated', 'DVD', 'can', 'not', 'just', 'release', 'show', 'original', 'music', 'securing', 'rights', 'songs', 'do', 'would', 'face', 'major', 'lawsuit', 'Given', 'used', 'songs', 'many', 'established', 'artists', 'show', 'getting', 'rights', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'cheap', 'Which', 'why', 'sets', 'were', 'so', 'expensive', 'when', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'were', 'originally', 'released', 'Now', 'dubbed', 'music', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'Universal', 'being', 'cheap', 'could', 'be', 'rights', 'holders', 'refusing', 'allow', 'music', 'be', 'included', 'fall', 'camp', 'will', 'take', 'having', 'show', 'available', 'DVD', 'even', 'imperfect', 'release', 'are', 'ever', 'going', 'get', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'put', 'out', '25th', 'anniversary', 'complete', 'series', 'set', 'tons', 'bonus', 'features', 'commentaries', 'original', 'music', 'not', 'likely', 'come', 'what', 'out', 'now', 'best', 'fans', 'show', 'are', 'going', 'get.Story', 'wise', 'second', 'season', 'continued', 'focus', 'fish-out-of', 'water', 'aspect', 'Joel', 'being', 'town', 'start', 'acclimate', 'somewhat', 'still', 'out', 'show', 'also', 'continued', 'build', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'Maggie', 'Joel', 'continued', 'sexual', 'tension', 'also', 'started', 'develop', 'ancillary', 'characters', 'focusing', 'more', 'quirkiness', 'town.As', 'far', 'what', 'there', 'extra', 'features', 'episode', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'unexposed', 'footage', 'basically', 'being', 'gag', 'reel', 'side', 'disc', '10-20', 'min', 'kind', 'stuff', 'are', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'scenes', 'making', 'features', 'through.The', 'show', '5', 'star', 'music', 'will', 'be', 'bigger', 'issue', 'people', 'others', 'not', 'likely', 'ever', 'be', 'perfect', 'release', 'show', 'get', 'not', 'will', 'really', 'depend', 'how', 'much', 'are', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'have', 'DVD']",N/A

842316,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0002OQYEU,Robert Moore,"[4, 5]","I give this set five stars based entirely on the content of the individual episodes, which are obviously deserving of such a rating.  But before talking about the show, let me add my rant to everyone else about the weaknesses in the set.  My understanding is that the double-sided discs are in the process of being replaced by single sided.  But the price is beyond any justification.  At most this set should be priced at around $20 and really should be around $15.  In fact, there really was very little excuse for not releasing both Seasons One and Two in the same set.  MOONLIGHTING faced much the same dilemma as NORTHERN EXPOSURE.  A late season replacement, the first season of the show had only a very small number of episodes.  When they released MOONLIGHTING, however, they put out both the very short Season One and Season Two in one package.  I think not doing that with NORTHERN EXPOSURE was unforgivable.Rant over.  The episodes themselves, I'm delighted to report, are every bit as enchanting as when I first watched them in the early nineties.  Season Two saw the show develop into pretty much the show that we would know for the rest of its run.  Season One differed from the rest of the series in its relatively lack of surreality and experimentation.  There are only seven episodes, even fewer than the eight-episode Season One, but they introduce dreams, impossible situations, fantasy sequences, and all manner of surreality.Another change in Season Two is the cast balance.  Holling and Shelly come to play a far more important role in Season Two while the obvious potential romance between Joel and Maggie comes far more to the forefront.  In fact, if not for the rather absurd yet hilarious death of Rick (who is hit by a falling satellite, necessitating the most unusual coffin in history after it melds with Rick's body), her boyfriend, perhaps the two of them would have gotten together.  Most important, however, is the grwowing importance of Chris in the show.  If Joel and Maggie are the nominal leads of the show, Chris is its heart and soul.  His philosophical ramblings on KBHR give the show the aesthetic, moral, and religious dimensions that made it so unique.The most wonderful thing about these DVDs--as overpriced and poorly designed as they are--is that they preserve and make accessible one of the most delightful shows in the history of TV.  I was telling a friend that while I have many other shows I love as much or even more, from BUFFY to FARSCAPE to LOST to VERONICA MARS to THE X-FILES and so on, the residents of Cicely might be the ones I would choose to make my neighbors.  I love BUFFY but I never got the sense that I would and could become a part of the Scoobies.  But as I watch these wonderful eccentrics I get the sense that this is the place where I could fit in.  But maybe I'm a nut, too.I will end by admitting that these DVDs have created a dilemma for me.  I generally buy copies of my favorite shows on DVD and rent the rest from Netflix.

What I am suprised about in others reviews is about Season 2. There is only 7 episodes?  How can this be?  I watched the show as it was shown the first time on TV and they had more than 7 episodes in year 2.  I actually taped all the shows when they were shown in reruns on the A&E; Channel and I know that Season 2 had more than 7 episodes.  ( I checked my video tapes and have 101 episodes taped!  I believe that is all of the shows)  The first year did not have the normal episode amount for TV shows because it started later in the year than other new shows.  The DVD's will get very expensive if we have to buy them seven episodes at a time.

842326,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B0002OQYEU,Tom Benton,"[1, 2]","I was very charmed by ""Northern Exposure""'s first season, but I fell in love with its second.  Over the period of a mere 7 episodes, I went from a fan to an addict.  The 7-episode second season of ""Northern Exposure"" is far superior to a full 22-episode season of most other shows, and a flawless example of how to make great television.  Season Two consists solely of delightful episodes, some of which are simply unforgettable.  These include the season premiere, ""Goodbye to All That"", in which Joel (Rob Morrow) deals with a breakup from his longtime girlfriend in New York, who has decided to marry an elderly judge instead, and the season finale, ""Slow Dance"", in which the O'Connell curse strikes again when Rick (Grant Goodeve) is killed after a satellite falls from space and collides with him.  Season Two makes the show's trademark dream sequences a regular aspect of each episode, and in its in this season that the characters begin to feel like family.  That's thanks to creative (and absurd) storylines, quirky writing, and exquisite casting.But enough about the show - I'm here to defend this DVD set.  Since its release, Universal's ""Complete Second Season"" set has been lambasted for numerous reasons.  For one thing, the packaging.  Now this I don't understand at all.  The parka packaging is the cutest, coolest TV-on-DVD packaging I have ever seen.  I think it's a pity that they didn't continue with it beyond this season.  The other complaint is the music replacement.  All the original music from these episodes has been replaced.  I can understand the fans' outrage over this.  As I had never seen the episodes before watching this DVD, I wasn't bothered, but I appreciate the ill-feelings of those who had seen the episodes previously, and I am very displeased that Universal chose to release the episodes like this.  However, I still think that this DVD release has been a little unfairly bashed, and although fans have good reason to be outraged, I would highly recommend this to those who enjoyed the first season but have never seen the episodes as they originally aired.",5,"Second is superb, sensational, and downright sumptuous",1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,2100,"['was', 'very', 'charmed', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'first', 'season', 'fell', 'love', 'second', 'period', 'mere', '7', 'episodes', 'went', 'fan', 'addict', '7-episode', 'second', 'season', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'far', 'superior', 'full', '22-episode', 'season', 'most', 'other', 'shows', 'flawless', 'example', 'how', 'make', 'great', 'television', 'Season', 'Two', 'solely', 'delightful', 'episodes', 'are', 'simply', 'unforgettable', 'include', 'season', 'premiere', 'Goodbye', 'Joel', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'breakup', 'longtime', 'girlfriend', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'decided', 'marry', 'elderly', 'judge', 'instead', 'season', 'finale', 'Slow', 'Dance', ""O'Connell"", 'curse', 'strikes', 'again', 'when', 'Rick', 'Grant', 'Goodeve', 'killed', 'satellite', 'space', 'collides', 'Season', 'Two', 'show', 'trademark', 'dream', 'regular', 'aspect', 'episode', 'season', 'characters', 'begin', 'feel', 'family', 'thanks', 'creative', 'absurd', 'storylines', 'quirky', 'writing', 'exquisite', 'casting.But', 'enough', 'show', ""'m"", 'here', 'defend', 'DVD', 'set', 'release', 'Universal', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', 'set', 'been', 'lambasted', 'numerous', 'reasons', 'one', 'thing', 'packaging', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'parka', 'packaging', 'cutest', 'coolest', 'TV-on-DVD', 'packaging', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'think', 'pity', 'did', ""n't"", 'continue', 'season', 'other', 'complaint', 'music', 'replacement', 'original', 'music', 'episodes', 'been', 'replaced', 'can', 'understand', 'fans', 'outrage', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'episodes', 'watching', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'appreciate', 'ill-feelings', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'episodes', 'previously', 'am', 'very', 'displeased', 'Universal', 'chose', 'release', 'episodes', 'However', 'still', 'think', 'DVD', 'release', 'been', 'little', 'unfairly', 'bashed', 'fans', 'have', 'good', 'reason', 'be', 'outraged', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'season', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'episodes', 'originally', 'aired']",N/A

If someone had told me years ago that I would someday refuse to buy this on DVD, I would have thought they were crazy.  But I would have to be crazy to buy it.A great part of Northern Exposure's charm was its music.  The people who made the series obviously gave a lot of thought to finding just the right music to support, or to make, a scene.  I don't think anyone before had given so much thought to the music heard on a television show.  It is sad that the people who put out this DVD did not care enough to keep the music intact.I will never, ever, buy this set until the music is restored.

The new set is priced at $59.98 (available for preorder at $41.99), which is the same MSRP as the single seasons, so if you can wait you'll get twice as much N.E. for what you're paying now. Also, the new set will be SINGLE SIDED discs.

In fact, it amounts to theft to be charged at all if the product inside the package is not what is advertised on the outside packaging.Like any other film, television show, piece of recorded music, or other electronically reproduced media artform, this show's integrity depends on seeing the episodes in order, complete, uncut, unedited, and unaltered -- including the soundtrack.  Imagine some pumpkin-headed suit deciding to release ""Grease-The LImited Edition Classic Version"" with all the vocals dubbed by a girl-scout troup in MIlwaukee.  Or trying to pass off ""Star Wars Episode IV - the Acoustic Version"" with John William's score being hummed and tapped out on the kitchen counter.If it's not the original show, folks -- it's theft.  The greed of the suits with no moderating voice of good business.  I won't be buying any more DVDs in this series.  I may not be buying any more at all until I read reviews written by real people who really like the shows they are talking about (and who else is going to buy entire television series-packages but real fans?)You cheated me.  You stole from me.  You spoiled good memories and what should have been pleasant diversions.  You lied.
