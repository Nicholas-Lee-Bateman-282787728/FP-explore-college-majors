1594461,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B009B82E2E,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[8, 8]","In 2007, ""Baka to Test to Shokanju"" (Baka and Test) was created by Kenji Inoue. Featured as a light novel series and featuring the illustrations by Yui Haga, a total of 12 volumes have been printed thus far and a manga adaptation by Mosuke Mattaku began in 2009 in the magazine ""Shonen Ace"" and also on ""Famitsu Comic Clear"".An anime adaptation began in 2010 and a second season which aired in Japan in July 2011. And with the first season released in America on Blu-ray/DVD back in 2011, the second season will now be released by FUNimation in January 2013.The anime series features animation production from Silver Link and the previous staff from the first season which includes director Shin Oonuma (""Mahou Sensei Negima!"", ""Pani Poni Dash!""), screenplay by Katsuhiko Takayama (""Cat Planet Cuties"", ""ef: a tale of melodies"", ""Fullmetal Alchemist"", ""Ga-Rei-Zero""), music by Nijine (""Akikan"", ""Hatsukoi Limited"", ""Idolm@ster: Xenoglossia""), character designs by Miwa Oshima (""Hit o Nerae!"", Rakugo Tennyo Oyui!"") and art direction from Kohji Azuma (""Natsu no Arashi!"", ""Tokyo Requiem"", ""Arakawa Under the Bridge"").With the second season, Akihisa may not be the brightest guy in class but this time, both Mizuki Himeji and Minami Shimada want to make their move towards Akihisa.  But which girl will he pick?What is ""Baka and Test""?""Baka and Test"" revolve around a not-so-smart teenager named Akihisa Yoshii. Because he is not so smart, he is constantly called ""Baka"" (in Japanese which means stupid). Akihisa is also living on a very tight budget and because he doesn't have much money, he often has to cut his ramen noodles in pieces and eat them for breakfast, lunch and dinner.Akihisa goes to Fumizuki Academy where staff separate their students based on their test scores. The better the grade, the better their life will be in school. For example: ""A"" students have great furniture and desks and luxurious studying areas, while those with F's have regular classrooms but have crates or cardboard boxes as desks.But there is a way that lower grades students can get things from higher grade students and that is to challenge them in a battle for facilities.How this works out is that a student can call forth their ""Shokanju"" or Avatar and during the battle, a teacher supervises the battle. While students compete in various subjects, avatars can lose HP when struck by an opponent and when their point count reaches zero, they are disqualified. But a student can leave the battle before reaching a zero, take a supplemental exam and return back into battle.For Akihisa, his first day at Fumizuki Academy is to take a placement test. Its pretty much a given that Akihisa will be in the lowest class but when the intelligent student Mizuki Himeji is sick as is unable to complete her test, unfortunately she is given a zero and must join Akihisa and other delinquents in class F. The other delinquents include their class rep Yuji Sakamoto, the oftenly mistaken for a girl Hideyoshi Kinoshita, the perverted Tsuchiya Kouta and the tomboy Minami Shimada. Interesting enough, both Mizuki and Minami have a crush on Akihisa.But because Class F has the intelligent Mizuki (who should be an A student), it gives them an edge in battle. Also, despite students being in F class, they may not be good in certain subjects but some may be great in one.For the second season of ""Baka and Test"", the season focuses on Class F's interpersoal relationships as friends, but meanwhile, Akihisa is totally oblivious that he has two girls that like him a lot, Mizuki Himeji and Minami Shimada.We also learn the history between Class F leader Yuji Sakamoto and Shoko Kirashima and why she is so attached to him.Meanwhile, enemies of the past return for revenge against Class F, but does Class F have any chance of winning this time around?VIDEO:""Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts"" is presented in 1080p High Definition. I actually like the look of the series and the concentration of really elaborate artistic backgrounds. A very colorful series with good pastels, also use of poka dots on backgrounds and foregrounds. And also there is quite a bit of detail for a TV anime series and I think the efficacy of the animation and backgrounds is because SILVER LINK is a company that is used to doing in-between animation and ""Baka and Test"" is their first major anime production.So, unlike other major anime production studios who are often busy with other anime series, to have a company who is able to focus on a series definitely makes for a better production. Picture quality for this TV series is very good!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts"" is presented in English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 2.0. First, the good news is the voice acting for soundtracks are very well done. I watched the series in both soundtracks and typically I am biased to the Japanese soundtrack but for this series, both are well done!Second, because the English soundtrack is presented in lossless 5.1, there is better use of the surround channels and musical score. The series is not truly immersive because battles don't happen every episode but there is a good amount of sound effects that are presented through the surround channels.Subtitles are only in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts - Season 2"" comes with the following special features:Episode 3 Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary from Jamie Marchi (lead writer/voice actress for Shoko) and Brina Palencia (voice actress for Hideyoshi/Yuko)Episode 13 Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary from ADR engineers Kevin Leasure and Stephen Hoff about the series and how they got into FUNimation as engineers.Mission: Impossible: Baka Preview - (1:19) A ""Mission Impossible"" preview.Baka-Only Cross-Dressing Contest - (3:56) It's a cross-dressing contest and who will win?Mission: Impossible: Baka Mission 01 -(3:39) Hideyoshi Kinoshita stars in his first ""Baka Mission"".Mizuki Himeji Girls' Meal - (3:19) Mizuki (who is the worst cook) teaches people how to cook.The King Game in Fumizuki Academy - (4:54) The F class plays the ""King"" game.Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts Spinout! - Featuring nine animated shorts and cm: ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Magical Hideyoshi, Hideyoshi, CM 1&#8243;, ""Karaoke Mix"", ""Magical Hideyoshi, Hideyoshi, CM 2&#8243;, ""Magical Hideyoshi, Hideyoshi"", ""Mission Impossibler: Baka"", ""Runaway Haduki"", ""Akihisa's Inquisition"", ""Cherry Blossoms Viewing Party"".Promo Videos - (4:11) Japanese Promotional video for ""Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts - Season 2&#8243;.Original Commercials - (1:03) Original Japanese TV commercials for ""Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts - Season 2&#8243;.U.S. Trailer - FUNimation trailer for ""Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts - Season 2&#8243;.Textless Opening Song: ""Kimi + Nazo + Watashi de Jump!""Textless Closing Songs: ""Eureka Baby"", ""Baka to Koshitsu to Kodoku Meshi"", ""Hi-Ho!!""Trailers - FUNimation trailersEXTRAS:""Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts Season 2 - The Complete Set"" comes with a slip over cover case, Blu-ray and the DVD versions of the series.JUDGMENT CALL:Last season, I discussed how the actual concept of ""Baka and Test"" was pretty intriguing. As a big fan of RPG games, I felt that the concept of classes getting into battle, especially the underdogs - The F Class challenging the other grades was pretty cool and also the introduction of the Avatar system.But as the first season focused on the battles between Class F and other higher classes, with season two, the season focuses on interpersonal relationships within Class F and also the history of some of the characters.Also, much noticeable in the second season is much more fan service, as Akihisa, Yuji and the guys can't help but look at other girls, while the other girls in Class F are not too thrilled and will show their anger towards them.With the first half of episodes being fun and upbeat with the group hanging out at the beach. attending a festival (in which they group ends up in a crossdressing contest), we are also introduced to some past stories as how Akihisa met Mizuki (the Punishment Inspector) and why Minami and Mizuki fell for him.  And also the guys trying to find a way into the girls bathroom.The second half of the series continues to focus on the love triangle between Akihisa, Minami and Mizuki and what happens when Akihisa accidentally sends Minami in what appears to be a love confession.  And what happens when she kisses him in front of Mizuki.  We also learn the history of Yuji and Shoko and why she fell for him.And what is ""Baka and Test"" without a class battle, and this time around the enemies of the past return for payback against Class F.Needless to say, ""Baka and Test"" season two turned out to be a crazy, hilarious entertaining season. While the first season was good in focusing on the class battles, this time around, it's all about love triangles and the guys just wanting to have fun with other girls yet, oblivious to how upset the other girls of Class F are when they behave that way.But with this second season, there is more character-drive plots and also character building storylines that we didn't get to see much of, in the first season.And as for the animation and character designs, as mentioned earlier, I felt that SILVER LINK, a newer company did a great job. Especially since they are not a major studio and their talent are focusing on several series at one time, SILVER LINK had more time to dedicate to the overall look of the series. From the detailed and artistic backgrounds to the character designs, for a TV series, ""Baka and Test"" looks pretty good on Blu-ray and you get a good number of special features as well.Overall, ""Baka and Test"" is a fun and enjoyable series that can be easily described as wild, crazy and even perverted at times. But it's great to see FUNimation bringing out a series that focuses on comedy and for those who want a break from the usual dark or action-oriented anime series on Blu, will definitely enjoy ""Baka and Test: Summon the Beast Season 2&#8243;.Recommended!",4,"The second season is wild, crazy and even perverted at times..",1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,10099,"['2007', 'Baka', 'Test', 'Shokanju',

I watched a couple more times, and I really liked it. It's a lot of fun. Season 2 is pretty much just about the guys of class F trying to peep on the girls' changing room and bath. It's kind of odd that an entire season of this show is dedicated to that single purpose, but it's still really fun. There are a couple background episodes for the main characters. Season 2 is a little better than the first one. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are all still really good. I think that they are gonna continue this series even further. I hope they do. It's a lot of fun to watch. I think that it's a safe bet for most anime fans. The language is moderate, and there isn't any nudity. So 14 and up is a good rating.

Their friendship with each other and friendship with other students is what I admire in this series. I love that the staff let them battle it out and test them when their scores drop to zero. I like that the student can battle in subject that they are well versed in. I wish that there were more to this series.,5,Everlasting Friendship,1387497600,"12 20, 2013",2013,445,"['chose', 'anime', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'F', 'class', 'students', 'work', 'together', 'skills', 'beat', 'upper', 'class', 'student', 'friendship', 'other', 'friendship', 'other', 'students', 'what', 'admire', 'series', 'love', 'staff', 'let', 'battle', 'test', 'when', 'scores', 'drop', 'zero', 'like', 'student', 'can', 'battle', 'subject', 'are', 'well', 'versed', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'series']",Baka & Test: Summon The Beasts - Season 2

The episodes hijinx and slapstick comedy are pretty reminiscent to another couple of series from Funimation Cat Planet Cuties and Heavens Lost Property and thankfully the drama while in the series is kept relatively light.  The romantic triangle quagmire we've seen in hundred of other series is here too but the endearing personalities of the characters keeps it surprisingly fresh and enjoyable.  The voice cast from the subbed and dubbed do a terrific job playing their character roles in the series,the animation is a mix of standard to seriously drawn out but more to highlight the comedic situation in the scene and the soundtrack fits the series perfectly.  While again somewhat pricey I feel it's forgivable for such a entertaining series that I truly like, but if you haven't seen the series I suggest getting the first set and seeing if you wish to continue and get this second half which if you find the first part of the series as hilariously entertaining as I did you're sure to get this set as well....",5,The Second Set Of Hilarity Is Here For The Fans,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,1142,"['already', 'seen', 'first', 'half', 'entertaining', 'hilarious', 'series', 'then', 'obviously', 'second', 'half', 'must', 'have', 'episodes', 'hijinx', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'are', 'pretty', 'reminiscent', 'couple', 'series', 'Funimation', 'Cat', 'Planet', 'Cuties', 'Heavens', 'Lost', 'Property', 'thankfully', 'drama', 'series', 'kept', 'relatively', 'light', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'quagmire', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hundred', 'other', 'series', 'here', 'too', 'endearing', 'personalities', 'characters', 'keeps', 'surprisingly', 'fresh', 'enjoyable', 'voice', 'cast', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'do', 'terrific', 'job', 'playing', 'character', 'roles', 'series', 'animation', 'mix', 'standard', 'seriously', 'drawn', 'out', 'more', 'highlight', 'comedic', 'situation', 'scene', 'soundtrack', 'series', 'perfectly', 'again', 'somewhat', 'pricey', 'feel', 'forgivable', 'such', 'entertaining', 'series', 'truly', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'series', 'suggest', 'getting', 'first', 'set', 'seeing', 'wish', 'continue', 'get', 'second', 'half', 'find', 'first', 'part', 'series', 'hilariously', 'entertaining', 'did', ""'re"", 'sure', 'get', 'set', 'as', 'well']",Baka & Test: Summon The Beasts - Season 2
1594468,A94NOJCJCI6PB,B009B82E2E,Sean,"[2, 5]","The original Baka and Test was a funny, entertaining ride that I happily gave a 7.5 due to that fact. With the second season I didn't expect the original formula to really change, but what I did expect was some form of plot or progression or something of the like. Not that Summon the Beasts had a fantastic story or anything, it was kind of weak in that regard. But the second season just doesn't go anywhere or do much of anything. Now, I'm not saying things don't happen, because things do happen. But the problem I have is that it mostly feels like filler. And when you have a whole thirteen episode season of a show and eighty percent of it feels like filler, you know you're doing something wrong.The beginning of this season feels like an episode of the Powerpuff Girls or something along those lines with the show divided into two halves, telling two different stories. So I figured we were dealing with just a silly straight up comedy, the show understanding where its strengths lie and exploiting them. The problem was, it wasn't that funny. Especially compared to the first season, we were getting pretty much the same jokes from before. After that we get a story arc about a summer camp and peeping and some generic trivial business to that extent. This arc did provide a bit of a story, but once again I found that the comedy wasn't really there. What I did like from this part was the romance (though accidental) that began to develop. The series was missing any form of romantic development in the first season, and it seemed to be moving along quite nicely at this point. After that we get two episodes of backstory. The first is about how Minami transferred to Japan from Germany and met Yoshii. This was a really good, heartfelt episode. It is a good first person narrative on a stranger in a strange place. It helps Minami come across as a good, three dimensional character as opposed to her counterpart (we'll get to that later). After that we see how Yuji and Shoko wound up together (or more precisely, how Yuji got stuck with Shoko). This episode seemed a lot more like filler. It went on, and on, and on. I could feel the heart, I could understand its purpose, but the internal dialogue Yuji goes through when watching Shoko get bullied is pretty unbearable and he comes across as a complete ass. I get the feeling I'm supposed to like this guy and have sort-of feelings for Shoko. But that episode makes me feel like Shoko is really the more likeable character, despite her violence and craziness.Then there are about three episodes and *SPOILER ALERT* Minami and Yoshii appear to finally be getting somewhere! But nope, the writer doesn't want to enrage anybody so continues to leave Yoshii's romantic interest open. The continual teases of Yoshii liking either Minami or Mizuki more and wanting to be with her is annoying. And that's the problem with love triangles like this, most of the time the writer won't get the main guy together with either character because he/she doesn't want to enrage fans of the other character. For me, I want to see Yoshii get together with my favorite character, but that's where the series really finds it has problems. I mentioned that the romance doesn't go anywhere in my first season review. Well, the romance does get somewhere here, but it's quickly shot down before it goes anywhere and played off as Yoshii being an idiot.And this opens up another can of problems. The first season really made me feel like Yoshii and Mizuki were closer to dating than Minami and him. But, this season it makes it feel like Minami is the real romantic interest, focuses on her a lot more, and then turns around and makes Mizuki once again seem like the main love interest.And I've got a variety of problems with Mizuki that I'll get to in a moment.The animation is the exact same quality as the first season. It's got that manga look and sometimes it can be resort to still images for a few seconds. It's not fantastic quality and none of the character designs really stand out in the crowd.And with sound you get a really childish opening that I guess fits the show but isn't that fantastic. The closing is another study in basic. There is a second closing that they use once for whatever reason. I never figured that one out.Now to the classic characters section where I complain about romances and bad characters. The romances won't go into my overall score because that's bias beyond belief but characters are always a good portion of the scoring.I'm just going to start where I left off a few paragraphs ago. Why does Mizuki seem to be the main romance interest? What am I supposed to see in her that makes me root for her and Yoshii to get together? Is it the study in contrasts, one being an idiot, the other smart? Is it the fact she's cute and girly and has big boobs? I mean, I don't understand wherein I'm supposed to find her likeable. She can't cook, she's smart, and she's pretty much the polar opposite of Yoshii. So why does he go after her? Because they've known each other since grade school? She seems more like a friend than a lover.Meanwhile Minami actually gets a lot more time as the focal point of the romance, yet is thrown aside later on. Despite the fact she is violent, she is totally likeable. I thought she was one of the best characters in the show, especially due to the fact we see her past and we see her outside of school talking about her feelings a lot more than Mizuki. She genuinely likes Yoshii, loves him even, and we can tell that really easily, we see that she is mad about the fact he keeps choosing Mizuki over her. Meanwhile Mizuki has no character definition and just gets jealous and bitches about his feelings about her and we never see a clear definition of her feelings or why she feels that way. The series never shows exactly how she met Yoshii and why she really likes him. She's completely two dimensional and basic and the series never does anything to show any other side of her than the ""I like Yoshii"" side. Minami on the other hand is shown as having a lot of troubles, as having problems with jealousy, of really trying to get together with him but failing.I just have a feeling that I'm supposed to root for Yoshii and Mizuki because she's got big boobs and is cute and girly. But boobs do not a good romance make.And Yoshii as a character is annoying at points, likeable at points. He swings back and forth. He's so stupid and oblivious to everything but that's his character. But he's usually unbearably stupid. His stupidity is the reason romances go nowhere. Though I must say that a heartfelt moment he shares with another character about Minami does come across as the most heartfelt lines of the whole series. I felt he was so much more likeable and in his element when he admitted his liking Minami, but then it reverts back to the love triangle thing and ends in utter dissatisfaction for the viewer.I've already talked about Shoko and Yuji. Shoko is cute, she's funny, and while she may come across as crazy I feel like Yuji is a total ass to her. Though the series does throw out some hints that Yuji does like her too, maybe even loves her.Other characters such as Kouta and Hideyoshi resume their positions as the exact same characters from the first season. Hideyoshi as the boy everyone thinks is a girl is so overplayed by the time the summer camp happens, it gets to be totally unfunny. Kouta as a pervert and nosebleeding everywhere gets old as well.That's just another fault with this second season is that there is very little character development aside from Yoshii and Minami. Otherwise, everyone is the same old, same old, and acts the same and has the same character gags we laughed at during the first season.In summary, Baka to Test's second season is pretty much filler. It goes somewhere, then steps back to the start to keep fanboys/girls happy. The comedy of the first season is here, but is very rarely funny and the reuse of jokes becomes almost painful. Not that I didn't like parts of it, some of the characters I genuinely like and enjoy watching. But overall, I feel like the second season is pointless most of the time. Minami's character may be the only thing that saved this from being anything less than merely ""meh"".Baka to Test 2 is a 4 out of 10.",2,Weaker than the First Season,1372204800,"06 26,
