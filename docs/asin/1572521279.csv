Some sunsets are slow, some are very slow, but they are never alike. You can see a Tarkovsky film 10 times and  it's different with every viewing. Usually the first time is boring. I've  learnt not to rent Tarkovsky. Jump in and buy it. Live with it...it will  reward you. Nostalghia is extraordinary and probably one of the slowest and  oddest of his works, and incredibly moving. The beauty of this film is  sublime.

185844,A1F9XJJ2A0XRV9,1572521279,"""ateliermp""","[6, 7]","The mercurial nature of this film - its liquidity (incompressible but formless state) - is mesmerizing. The central narrative - a Russian poet researching a Russian musician's time spent in Italy in the 1700s - is the frame which the amorphous stuff of Tarkovsky's film flows up against, into and around without every reaching saturation. All of this is to say, Nostalghia is a portrait of the state of vague desire felt by all sentient beings without ever achieving what is longed for. The exquisite structure of the film - its mise en scene - is somewhere in-between a  parable by Bergman or Antonioni, a parabolical milieu that represents the intersection of variable states of consciousness (of vaporous, fixed and fluid states belonging to one or another of the inhabitants of this film, inclusive of the landscape and architecture) best illustrated by the long tracking shots Tarkovsky used in the black-and-white dream sequences where figures appear first in one part of the evolving frame and then in another, looking as it were at themselves looking at themselves looking at the dreamer looking at himself. There is a recurring theme of architecture as analog for consciousness, and several scenes where architecture in ruins is invaded by nature. And then there is rain, permeating this symbolical structural system like the fog that opens the film and suggesting a rotting, decomposing and regenerative essence within the film mirroring the ennui and the morbidity of the Russian poet as he slides toward his own end, making a pilgrimage across an outdoor pool with a lighted candle to fulfill the promise he has made to a reclusive and visionary madman. This eccentric man of faith has passed his own obsession with this ritual act on to Andrei, the poet, unable to complete the transaction himself. The longing for Russia, the poet's affliction (shared with the 18th-century composer), becomes a universal condition as it is deferred and transcribed into a quest for something that transcends time and space and nationality, bringing home the poet's words that to understand one another we must dissolve national boundaries (and one might add 'natural' boundaries), the provisional borders and walls suggestive of inexorable psychic states - rationality, individuality, sanity, madness and, of course, nostalgia.",5,Unrequited Longing,1004745600,"11 3, 2001",2001,2325,"['mercurial', 'nature', 'film', 'liquidity', 'incompressible', 'formless', 'state', 'mesmerizing', 'central', 'narrative', 'Russian', 'poet', 'researching', 'Russian', 'musician', 'time', 'spent', 'Italy', '1700s', 'frame', 'amorphous', 'stuff', 'Tarkovsky', 'film', 'up', 'reaching', 'saturation', 'say', 'Nostalghia', 'portrait', 'state', 'vague', 'desire', 'felt', 'sentient', 'beings', 'ever', 'achieving', 'what', 'longed', 'exquisite', 'structure', 'film', 'mise', 'scene', 'somewhere', 'in-between', 'parable', 'Bergman', 'Antonioni', 'parabolical', 'milieu', 'intersection', 'variable', 'states', 'consciousness', 'vaporous', 'fixed', 'fluid', 'states', 'belonging', 'one', 'inhabitants', 'film', 'inclusive', 'landscape', 'architecture', 'best', 'illustrated', 'long', 'tracking', 'shots', 'Tarkovsky', 'used', 'black-and-white', 'dream', 'sequences', 'where', 'figures', 'appear', 'first', 'one', 'part', 'evolving', 'frame', 'then', 'looking', 'were', 'looking', 'looking', 'dreamer', 'looking', 'recurring', 'theme', 'architecture', 'analog', 'consciousness', 'several', 'scenes', 'where', 'architecture', 'ruins', 'invaded', 'nature', 'then', 'rain', 'permeating', 'symbolical', 'structural', 'system', 'fog', 'film', 'suggesting', 'rotting', 'decomposing', 'regenerative', 'essence', 'film', 'mirroring', 'ennui', 'morbidity', 'Russian', 'poet', 'own', 'end', 'making', 'pilgrimage', 'outdoor', 'pool', 'lighted', 'candle', 'fulfill', 'promise', 'made', 'reclusive', 'visionary', 'madman', 'eccentric', 'man', 'faith', 'passed', 'own', 'obsession', 'ritual', 'act', 'Andrei', 'poet', 'unable', 'complete', 'transaction', 'longing', 'Russia', 'poet', 'affliction', 'shared', '18th-century', 'composer', 'universal', 'condition', 'deferred', 'transcribed', 'quest', 'something', 'time', 'space', 'nationality', 'bringing', 'home', 'poet', 'words', 'understand', 'one', 'must', 'dissolve', 'national', 'boundaries', 'one', 'might', 'add', ""'natural"", 'boundaries', 'provisional', 'borders', 'walls', 'suggestive', 'inexorable', 'psychic', 'states', 'rationality', 'individuality', 'sanity', 'madness', 'course', 'nostalgia']",Nostalghia VHS

I always neglected it, but the photograph had this appeal to me.I did not get the chance of watching such masterpieces before. Only a few years ago did I start watching off beat movies (and I was also underage for such films). But a few days back I pulled the book down from my father's shelf, and started to flip through the pages.I was so amazed by this man, Mr. Tarkovsky, that I asked my father about him, and he said he throughout his life had not seen a finer director than this man. Well I have learnt to trust my father in the fields of art, as he is a painter himself, and I bought this movie from amazon.comFrom the first shot in black and white, I was spellbounded by the cinematorgraphy of this magneficient piece of art. It had this haunting look to it, and this marvellous beauty, truly wonderful.The basic story of the film is that a Russian poet has travelled to Italy on a research mission to find out about his favourite  music composer Sosnovsky. He stays in this town, with his beautiful assistant and in the course of his stay he is haunted by the memories of Russia, and his childhood, and his past.The basic story though maybe simple the surreal screenplay, and the photography of this movie is truly brilliant. I have never seen a person depict birth, life and death, in such a subtle and beautious fashion.I feel many people will sleep through this movie, but those who get the essense of it, would bask in the wonder of the greater birth forever.I have movies by Kurosawa, and Fellini, Trauffaut, Kubrick, but none matches up to this man. Andrei Tarkovsky, he made only 7 movies in his lifetime, and all of them are masterpieces, and I feel this is his gem.I would recommend this movie for all, but I would especially recommend to those people who are looking for another dimension to this existense, this movie is truly magnificient.The DVD quality is pretty good, and no problems with the subtitles, and the sound quality.A masterpiece by the greatest master of the silver screen.

It is also his most beautiful, with some of the greatest cinemtography ever committed to celluloid (Giuesppe Lanci was the cinematographer).  The film concerns itself with a Russian coming to Italy to research on a Russian composer who died there.  As others have pointed out, the word ""Nostalghia"" is the Italian pronuciation, and the film is about nostalghia for one's homeland, specifically Russian nostlaghia.  Tarkovsky has said that Russians, more than other nationalities, miss their homeland more than others, and have a hard time assimiliating in other lands.  This film gives you one amazing shot after another.  Some of the shots are truly amazing.  The most famous shot here in where Andrei carries a candle across the pool, believing that if he makes it without the candle going out, he will save mankind.  They rehearsed this shot for 3 days, and on the 4th day they shot it.  Tarkovsky told Oleg Jankovsky (the lead actor) ""one action can be experienced as if it is your whole life"", then told him ""we've only got one take"".  They completed in one take, after which the crew burst out into appaulse.  This film is a deeply spirtual film, like all Tarkovsky, and it's one of his most meditative films.

185850,A1WTYALNQNQG99,1572521279,Larry L. Looney,"[39, 44]","Andrei Tarkovsky's NOSTALGHIA - like all of his amazing films - is filled with masterfully drawn images that simultaneously make the heart ache and lift it up to the heavens.  Literally hundreds of potential paintings lie within its frames.  But, beyond the visual, deeper than any of these, lies the heart of his work - and it touches the very soul of the viewer with the hands of a craftsman and seeker.Each of the three main characters - Andrei Gortchakov, a Russian poet (Oleg Yankovsky);  his beautiful Italian interpreter, Eugenia (Domiziana Giordano); and a local eccentric, Domenico (Erland Josephson) - is attempting, consciously or instinctively, to fill a void in their life.Gortchakov, in Italy to research the life of an 18th century Russian composer, is suffering terribly from homesickness - his thoughts and dreams often turn to his wife and home.  His interpreter makes romantic advances toward him - but he's so fixated on his wife that he doesn't even realize what she's doing.  When it occurs to him - she makes it pretty obvious, baring a breast to him in his hotel room and asking `Is this what you want...?' - he's visibly staggered, but remains sympathetic and caring towards her.  The parallels between his life and that of his subject are many - and as the film progresses, he seems to become increasingly aware of them.  This realization leaves him feeling emptier still - and this could be a big factor in his acceptance of the task assigned to him by the madman Domenico.  In fulfilling his promise, Gortchakov is perhaps the most successful of the three characters in his quest to fill the unnamed void within him.Domenico bears a great guilt.  Long considered to be mad, many years in the past he sequestered his wife and children within their home in a desperate attempt to protect them from what he saw as the imminent end of the world.  Suspicious neighbors alerted the authorities, who broke down the door and freed the family, who had not been outside for seven years.  In one of the most heart-wrenching scenes ever committed to film, we see Domenico, addled, gingerly pursuing his young son down a pathway.  The guilt that Domenico feels over this episode weighs heavily upon his shoulders for the rest of his life.  In a symbolic act of contrition, he attempts to carry a lighted candle across a pool - a seemingly simple task, made difficult by the heat rising from the waters and the air currents.  His neighbors, considering him to be unstable, think he's about to drown himself, and prevent him from completing the act.  When he meets Gortchakov - perhaps because he senses the emptiness in the soul of the poet - he asks him to accomplish this for him.  By giving the Russian the task of conveying the candle across the pool, he frees himself of his own promise, allowing him to move on to what he sees as the ultimate act of repentance - and at the same time, gifts the opportunity to the poet to commit a holy act by fulfilling a promise, which allows Gortchkov the chance to free his own aching spirit.Eugenia, the translator, has the least understanding of her own needs.  She, too, feels a void in her life - but she seems to think that she can fill it sexually, by `finding the right man'.  When Gortchakov rebuffs her advances, she abandons him and takes off to Rome, to another man.  We see this man only once in the film - while she talks on the phone to Gortchakov - and he seems distant, regarding her coolly, if at all.  It's easy to surmise that this is just one more fruitless, unfulfilling stop on her quest.Visually, Tarkovsky has done his usual, unequalled best in committing his ideas and ideals to film.  His work - here and in all of his films - is, I've come to believe, without peer.  From the opening images of the fog-shrouded Italian countryside - to the stunningly beautiful photography inside the church, candle-lit - to the hotel - to the spa - every scene has the ability to take the viewer's breath away, and, more importantly, to make the viewer think.  Tarkovsky's views of how humans are isolated from each other - and from themselves - by the technology and the cities we have built is underscored by the scene in Rome, where Domenico has traveled for a `demonstration', to air his views and give his public confession.  He is positioned atop a statue, high above a piazza - the camera angle reveals a wide, low-angled set of marble steps.  One would perhaps expect to see a milling throng on these steps - but Tarkovsky instead places only a dozen or so people there.  The space between them, in this wide expanse of marble and edifice, simply and eloquently underscores the theme of human isolation.NOSTALGHIA - like all of Tarkovsky's work - is a film that should be viewed multiple times.  Each viewing will reveal new discoveries and insights.  His work is visionary.",5,FILLING SPIRITUAL VOIDS,1063152000,"09 10, 2003",2003,4850,"['Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'NOSTALGHIA', 'amazing', 'films', 'filled', 'masterfully', 'drawn', 'images', 'simultaneously', 'make', 'heart', 'ache', 'lift', 'heavens', 'Literally', 'hundreds', 'potential', 'paintings', 'lie', 'frames', 'visual', 'deeper', 'heart', 'work', 'very', 'soul', 'viewer', 'hands', 'craftsman', 'seeker.Each', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Andrei', 'Gortchakov', 'Russian', 'poet', 'Oleg', 'Yankovsky', 'beautiful', 'Italian', 'interpreter', 'Eugenia', 'Domiziana', 'Giordano', 'local', 'eccentric', 'Domenico', 'Erland', 'Josephson', 'attempting', 'consciously', 'instinctively', 'fill', 'void', 'life.Gortchakov', 'Italy', 'research', 'life', '18th', 'century', 'Russian', 'composer', 'suffering', 'terribly', 'homesickness', 'thoughts', 'dreams', 'often', 'turn', 'wife', 'home', 'interpreter', 'romantic', 'advances', 'so', 'fixated', 'wife', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'what', 'doing', 'When', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'baring', 'breast', 'hotel', 'room', 'asking', 'what', 'want', 'visibly', 'staggered', 'sympathetic', 'caring', 'towards', 'parallels', 'life', 'subject', 'are', 'many', 'film', 'become', 'increasingly', 'aware', 'realization', 'feeling', 'emptier', 'still', 'could', 'be', 'big', 'factor', 'acceptance', 'task', 'assigned', 'madman', 'Domenico', 'fulfilling', 'promise', 'Gortchakov', 'perhaps', 'most', 'successful', 'three', 'characters', 'quest', 'fill', 'unnamed', 'void', 'him.Domenico', 'great', 'guilt', 'Long', 'considered', 'be', 'mad', 'many', 'years', 'past', 'sequestered', 'wife', 'children', 'home', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'protect', 'what', 'saw', 'imminent', 'end', 'world', 'Suspicious', 'neighbors', 'alerted', 'authorities', 'who', 'broke', 'down', 'door', 'freed', 'family', 'who', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'outside', 'seven', 'years', 'one', 'most', 'heart-wrenching', 'scenes', 'ever', 'committed', 'film', 'see', 'Domenico', 'addled', 'gingerly', 'pursuing', 'young', 'son', 'down', 'pathway', 'guilt', 'Domenico', 'episode', 'heavily', 'shoulders', 'rest', 'life', 'symbolic', 'act', 'contrition', 'carry', 'lighted', 'candle', 'pool', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'task', 'made', 'difficult', 'heat', 'rising', 'waters', 'air', 'currents', 'neighbors', 'considering', 'be', 'unstable', 'think', 'drown', 'prevent', 'completing', 'act', 'When', 'Gortchakov', 'perhaps', 'emptiness', 'soul', 'poet', 'accomplish', 'giving', 'Russian', 'task', 'conveying', 'candle', 'pool', 'own', 'promise', 'allowing', 'move', 'what', 'ultimate', 'act', 'repentance', 'same', 'time', 'gifts', 'opportunity', 'poet', 'commit', 'holy', 'act', 'fulfilling', 'promise', 'Gortchkov', 'chance', 'free', 'own', 'aching', 'spirit.Eugenia', 'translator', 'least', 'understanding', 'own', 'needs', 'too', 'void', 'life', 'think', 'can', 'fill', 'sexually', 'finding', 'right', 'man', 'When', 'Gortchakov', 'advances', 'Rome', 'man', 'see', 'man', 'only', 'once', 'film', 'phone', 'Gortchakov', 'distant', 'regarding', 'coolly', 'easy', 'surmise', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'fruitless', 'unfulfilling', 'stop', 'quest.Visually', 'Tarkovsky', 'done', 'usual', 'unequalled', 'best', 'committing', 'ideas', 'ideals', 'film', 'work', 'here', 'films', ""'ve"", 'come', 'believe', 'peer', 'opening', 'images', 'fog-shrouded', 'Italian', 'countryside', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'church', 'candle-lit', 'hotel', 'spa', 'scene', 'ability', 'take', 'viewer', 'breath', 'away', 'more', 'importantly', 'make', 'viewer', 'think', 'Tarkovsky', 'views', 'how', 'humans', 'are', 'isolated', 'other', 'technology', 'cities', 'have', 'built', 'underscored', 'scene', 'Rome', 'where', 'Domenico', 'traveled', 'demonstration', 'air', 'views', 'give', 'public', 'confession', 'positioned', 'statue', 'high', 'piazza', 'camera', 'angle', 'wide', 'low-angled', 'set', 'marble', 'steps', 'One', 'would', 'perhaps', 'expect', 'see', 'milling', 'throng', 'steps', 'Tarkovsky', 'instead', 'only', 'dozen', 'so', 'people', 'there', 'space', 'wide', 'expanse', 'marble', 'edifice', 'simply', 'eloquently', 'theme', 'human', 'isolation.NOSTALGHIA', 'Tarkovsky', 'work', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'multiple', 'times', 'viewing', 'will', 'reveal', 'new', 'discoveries', 'insights', 'work', 'visionary']",Nostalghia VHS

When I came to myself, I was looking at the menu with my mind full of Beethoven, candles, and images of water. Later I realized that I had been taken to another plane of existence, experiencing an epic journey through meditation, spirituality, and total beauty.I bought a box of emergency candles and a lighter the next day.This is exactly what would happen if you can fully appreciate Tarkovsky's masterful films. &quot;Nostalghia,&quot; however, has a touch of Hollywood-style. You might be able to notice several key scenes can often be found in, say, Spielberg's movies. However, they do not look contrived or pretentious, and the purpose of their existence is not merely begging for audience's tears. These scenes are among the best in history that create striking emotional impacts. The familiar plot is totally unrecognizable due to the unique sensations, unforgettable scenes, and perfect acting.The DVD itself, though, is quite disappointing. I can't even click on the time bar on my PowerDVD player. The picture quality is acceptable yet can be much better. The menu looks cheap and pretends to have a lot of extras. The trailer is simply BAD because it reveals everything. You may want to wait for a better version but I think only Criterion would dare to release a new one. RUSSICO will not do it because &quot;Nostalghia&quot; is in Italian. Nonetheless, the masterpiece alone worth the price, and you won't regret of buying it.I try to do the same as Andrei, but I can't even light the candle.Please watch this movie, thus you can feel the power of pure filmmaking.

We also notice a sign of sorts on the wall with ""1 + 1 = 1"" carefully written.  It's one of those ""What's this all about?"" moments of the film, which  commonly occur throughout much of Nostalghia.  What Tarkovsky is doing is what he does best: muddling accepted reality for something greater and more spiritual.The Russian interpretation of ""nostalghia"" is longing for one's homeland. For me, it's longing for the best of one's past. For those of you who have or have lost a beloved dog, this film will touch you all the more, especially during the piazza scene when the German Shepherd seen throughout the film reacts while the detached humans do nothing.What is this film about? The blurring between dreams and reality, abandonment, the deterioration of society and the deleterious effects of that deterioration to one's spirit, and no doubt much more.  We have become a people so consumed with the materialistic stuff heaped around us, that we no longer know what is important because we are too busy maintaining all that is unimportant.  We need to heed what Dominico cries out on the piazza: ""Life is simple-we must go back to where we were."" In that simplicity, lies our spirit; in that simplicity, thrives our spirit. But in the reality we have created as a society--and sadly now as a global intersociety--we cannot go back. There is no going back; we have traded simplicity for complexity, luxury, beautiful bodies, rap music, i-pods, Paris Hilton, and other things of little importance.  We have trivialized our spirit to the point that it is a withered vine neglected in some broken clay pot, pushed aside unnoticed behind a collection of DVDs. Domenico says that the ""heart's path is covered in shadow."" I say it is covered with materialistic crap as well.But don't get me wrong. This film is also about the beauty of life, and that that beauty is attainable because it is found within ourselves. That's where the search for beauty needs to begin; that's where the journey toward fulfillment needs to start--within ourselves.  The black and white scenes of personal reflection in Nostalghia excel in radiating this beauty.This film is definitely not for all. It's pace at times is slower than our most boring days. But it's that slowness that needs to be experienced and embraced if one is going to fully appreciate the art of this film.

185857,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,1572521279,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[4, 5]","Andrei Gorchakov (Oleg Yankovsky) is a Russian poet, visiting Italy to research the life of 18th Century Russian composer Pavel Sosnovsky, who had lived in Italy for a time, before committing suicide upon his return to Russia.  Andrei is himself on the verge of a breakdown, unable to commit to his research, and longing for his homeland, his wife and children.  At the same time he is unsettled by possible feelings for his beautiful interpreter and guide, Eugenia (Domiziana Giordano).  While visiting an ancient Roman bath, he is intrigued by Domenico (Bergman regular Erland Josephson), a local madman or holy fool, who had once kept his entire family indoors for seven years to protect them from an imagined apocalypse (or are we already living out the end he envisioned?).  Now, it seems, he is convinced that only Andrei can save the world, by having the faith to perform the apparently absurd ritual of bearing a lighted candle across the heated waters.It is a gorgeous film, perhaps the finest in an extraordinary body of work by one of the greatest of filmmakers.  I was quite impressed to find that the Korean copy (with the grey borders, that I bought here on Amazon from one of the listed sellers) was not at all a cheap bootleg version, but looks quite good.  Watching it on my large HD television, with an upconverting dvd player, I found the picture to be quite nuanced and lovely.  There was a lot of detail in the low key scenes, and it didn't all turn into shadow; and there was an enormous amount of contrast and range in the high key outdoor scenes, with no washing out of the bright details.  I have nothing to compare it to, so I can't say whether they've preserved the precise look of the original - it's been several years since I've seen this projected from an original 35mm print - but it looks quite impressive, and much better than the VHS copy owned by my local library.This film contains some of the richest imagery I've ever seen in a film, the dream sequences are stunningly visceral, and the use of light extraordinary throughout, but especially astonishing is the closing shot which I won't describe or give away since in many ways it encapsulates a great deal of the significance of the film as a whole.  Tarkovsky makes full use of the widescreen here, and shoots primarily in color but dreams, recollections and imaginations are often rendered in a richly toned black and white.  One other Tarkovskian element that strikes me as perhaps most powerfully developed here is the technique of ""folding"" space and time -- within a single pan of the camera, in a single shot, the same character will appear in repose in differing locations.  I guess it's possible that the characters get up and run around the camera to take their secondary and tertiary positions, but they never seem to be out of breath or out of repose.  It's an impressive and powerful effect, that gives the sense of an untold passage of time within the shot, that exceeds the duration of the shot itself.  If you've ever seen a Tarkovsky film before, many of the stylistic elements and the general approach will be familiar, but each of his works stands alone and says things that he doesn't in his others.  This is the film that Tarkovsky himself thought his greatest, and it is not hard to detect the autobiographical and perhaps even prophetic elements of this film.  Nostalghia was his first film made outside of Russia, and meant he was away from home for a long time.  He completed one film after this one, but was never able to return to his homeland.  For insights into Tarkovsky's life and thoughts, read his provocative and challenging treatiseSculpting in Time.  For insights into the development of this film, see hisVoyage in Time, a documentary that Tarkovsky made with Tonino Guerra while scouting locations in Italy and developing the story.",5,"An astonishing film about time and memory, about faith, madness, and artistic creation",1262304000,"01 1, 2010",2010,3860,"['Andrei', 'Gorchakov', 'Oleg', 'Yankovsky', 'Russian', 'poet', 'visiting', 'Italy', 'research', 'life', '18th', 'Century', 'Russian', 'composer', 'Pavel', 'Sosnovsky', 'who', 'had', 'lived', 'Italy', 'time', 'committing', 'suicide', 'return', 'Russia', 'Andrei', 'verge', 'breakdown', 'unable', 'commit', 'research', 'longing', 'homeland', 'wife', 'children', 'same', 'time', 'unsettled', 'possible', 'feelings', 'beautiful', 'interpreter', 'guide', 'Eugenia', 'Domiziana', 'Giordano', 'visiting', 'ancient', 'Roman', 'bath', 'intrigued', 'Domenico', 'Bergman', 'regular', 'Erland', 'Josephson', 'local', 'madman', 'holy', 'fool', 'who', 'had', 'once', 'kept', 'entire', 'family', 'indoors', 'seven', 'years', 'protect', 'imagined', 'apocalypse', 'are', 'already', 'living', 'out', 'end', 'envisioned', 'Now', 'convinced', 'only', 'Andrei', 'can', 'save', 'world', 'having', 'faith', 'perform', 'apparently', 'absurd', 'ritual', 'bearing', 'lighted', 'candle', 'heated', 'waters.It', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'extraordinary', 'body', 'work', 'one', 'greatest', 'filmmakers', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'find', 'Korean', 'copy', 'grey', 'borders', 'bought', 'here', 'Amazon', 'one', 'listed', 'sellers', 'was', 'not', 'cheap', 'bootleg', 'version', 'quite', 'good', 'Watching', 'large', 'HD', 'television', 'upconverting', 'dvd', 'player', 'found', 'picture', 'be', 'quite', 'nuanced', 'lovely', 'was', 'lot', 'detail', 'low', 'key', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'all', 'turn', 'shadow', 'was', 'enormous', 'amount', 'contrast', 'range', 'high', 'key', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'washing', 'bright', 'details', 'have', 'nothing', 'compare', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'ve"", 'preserved', 'precise', 'look', 'original', 'been', 'several', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'projected', 'original', '35mm', 'print', 'quite', 'impressive', 'much', 'better', 'VHS', 'copy', 'owned', 'local', 'library.This', 'film', 'richest', 'imagery', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'dream', 'sequences', 'are', 'stunningly', 'visceral', 'use', 'light', 'extraordinary', 'especially', 'astonishing', 'closing', 'shot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'describe', 'give', 'away', 'many', 'ways', 'great', 'deal', 'significance', 'film', 'whole', 'Tarkovsky', 'full', 'use', 'widescreen', 'here', 'shoots', 'primarily', 'color', 'dreams', 'recollections', 'imaginations', 'are', 'often', 'rendered', 'richly', 'toned', 'black', 'white', 'One', 'other', 'Tarkovskian', 'element', 'perhaps', 'most', 'powerfully', 'developed', 'here', 'technique', 'folding', 'space', 'time', 'single', 'pan', 'camera', 'single', 'shot', 'same', 'character', 'will', 'appear', 'repose', 'differing', 'locations', 'guess', 'possible', 'characters', 'get', 'up', 'run', 'camera', 'take', 'secondary', 'tertiary', 'positions', 'never', 'seem', 'be', 'breath', 'repose', 'impressive', 'powerful', 'effect', 'sense', 'untold', 'passage', 'time', 'shot', 'duration', 'shot', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Tarkovsky', 'film', 'many', 'stylistic', 'elements', 'general', 'approach', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'works', 'alone', 'things', ""n't"", 'others', 'film', 'Tarkovsky', 'thought', 'greatest', 'not', 'hard', 'detect', 'autobiographical', 'perhaps', 'even', 'prophetic', 'elements', 'film', 'Nostalghia', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'made', 'Russia', 'meant', 'was', 'away', 'home', 'long', 'time', 'completed', 'one', 'film', 'one', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'return', 'homeland', 'insights', 'Tarkovsky', 'life', 'thoughts', 'read', 'provocative', 'challenging', 'treatiseSculpting', 'Time', 'insights', 'development', 'film', 'see', 'hisVoyage', 'Time', 'documentary', 'Tarkovsky', 'made', 'Tonino', 'Guerra', 'scouting', 'locations', 'Italy', 'developing', 'story']",Nostalghia VHS

I have also seen Solaris which is similarly a good movie.But I just can't get myself to finish watching Nostalghia.  Tarkovsky specializes in Russian-style films which are long and slow-paced by Western standards and the two mentioned above are worth the effort.  But Nostalghia goes on and on and never seems to get anywhere.  The closest thing to a plot involves an expatriate Russian poet in Italy who is traveling with his Italian interpreter.  She is attractive but he has no romantic interest in her and they stay in separate rooms.  The whole idea is apparently that he is more interested in art and unusual experiences than her.  They encounter various scenes such as fields, churches, and largely deserted villages which are really the basis of the movie.They eventually reach a rundown isolated village where the poet encounters a man who would be considered mentally disturbed today but then just someone odd in the village.  This man believes he can save the world by walking through some puddle and the poet is fascinated by this.  This whole episode probably takes about an hour; I could only fast forward through it.The main object of the movie is apparently to portray different forms of art such as classical music and anything unusual such as the village man.  There are two many long takes which seem to mean nothing except contemplating some mundane scene.  These include things like fog, puddles of water, and church interiors.  Just about everything in this movie is implied so just about everything has to be inferred.  The problem here is that Tarkovsky's frame of reference is alien to most people.If you can make it through this movie there may be something more memorable than the endurance required to finish it.",3,CAN'T FINISH IT,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,1873,"['have', 'seen', 'Tarkovsky', 'long', 'epic', 'Andrei', 'Rublev', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'have', 'also', 'seen', 'Solaris', 'similarly', 'good', 'movie.But', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'finish', 'watching', 'Nostalghia', 'Tarkovsky', 'Russian-style', 'films', 'are', 'long', 'slow-paced', 'Western', 'standards', 'two', 'mentioned', 'are', 'effort', 'Nostalghia', 'never', 'get', 'anywhere', 'closest', 'thing', 'plot', 'expatriate', 'Russian', 'poet', 'Italy', 'who', 'traveling', 'Italian', 'interpreter', 'attractive', 'romantic', 'interest', 'stay', 'separate', 'rooms', 'whole', 'idea', 'apparently', 'more', 'interested', 'art', 'unusual', 'experiences', 'encounter', 'various', 'scenes', 'such', 'fields', 'churches', 'largely', 'deserted', 'villages', 'are', 'really', 'basis', 'movie.They', 'eventually', 'reach', 'rundown', 'isolated', 'village', 'where', 'poet', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'today', 'then', 'just', 'someone', 'odd', 'village', 'man', 'can', 'save', 'world', 'walking', 'puddle', 'poet', 'fascinated', 'whole', 'episode', 'probably', 'hour', 'could', 'only', 'fast', 'forward', 'it.The', 'main', 'object', 'movie', 'apparently', 'portray', 'different', 'forms', 'art', 'such', 'classical', 'music', 'anything', 'unusual', 'such', 'village', 'man', 'are', 'two', 'many', 'long', 'seem', 'mean', 'nothing', 'contemplating', 'mundane', 'scene', 'include', 'things', 'fog', 'puddles', 'water', 'church', 'interiors', 'Just', 'everything', 'movie', 'implied', 'so', 'just', 'everything', 'be', 'inferred', 'problem', 'here', 'Tarkovsky', 'frame', 'reference', 'alien', 'most', 'people.If', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'memorable', 'endurance', 'required', 'finish']",Nostalghia VHS

185862,A3N65ZMIYEWQ8X,1572521279,Tom Traubert,"[7, 8]","Tarkovsky's film speaks for itself. This review is more about Kino's blu-ray treatment.Please allow me to preface this by stating that I found Kino's BD transfer of ""The Sacrifice"" to be lousy overall, and I would rate it much lower than the generous 3.5/5.00 that Blu-ray.com gave it. Unacceptable lack of clarity and detail. However, unlike that transfer, which was heavily manipulated with DNR and edge enhancement (Kino claims otherwise, but DVDBeaver has close-ups proving edge-enhancement halos), their transfer for ""Nostalghia"" appears to be untouched. It is rife with damage - scratches, dirt, dust, pops, etc. Almost non-stop. The print is cluttered from start to finish. It is clear that no restoration of any kind was done for this release, which is an absolute travesty when you consider the significance of the filmmaker. While the source material certainly limits it somewhat, the quality of the audio is even worse. Did I mention there are NO supplements? At this price point, that's inexcusable.I traded my copy to a local McKays and will wait patiently and optimistically that a better distributor will one day purchase the rights and give this film the proper treatment. If you think I'm being too harsh, watch Criterion's immaculate blu-ray of ""Ivan's Childhood"", made 20 years before ""Nostalghia"".The demographic for 30 year-old Russian catalogue releases is probably fairly small. So, perhaps Kino decided this release was not worth the time or money.

It does not exist on the level of plot, and yet every image is so suggestive of things beyond or beneath the surface that the only thing comparable to it is a profoundly meaningful and haunting dream.Tarkovsky was tormented by his Soviet-enforced exile from his homeland Russia at the time he made this masterpiece, and the nostalgia he felt was more than for his own home - it was a nostalgia for the spiritual world that is absent in so much of modern life. It is supremely ironic he and his main character - a bitter Russian writer - felt nostalgia for the spirit in one of the most &quot;spiritual&quot; places on earth - Italy. And yet it is frighteningly appropriate today.There is none of the borrowing from other mediums - whether literature, theater or painting - that is common with other so-called art films. This film is the purest cinema that can exist, because everything is done as an image from reality - a reality that exists in the character's own world, and is transfered to the viewer's by means of the most intense visual imagination.The actors are so perfect in their roles that they do not seem to be acting at all. That is always a hallmark of Tarkovsky's films - utter realism of human behavior, without the slightest trace of fakery.Ingmar Bergman called this master of cinema the greatest of all filmmakers, and this is probably his greatest film. It is essential to anyone interested in the medium.",5,Pure poetic cinema,1046563200,"03 2, 2003",2003,1497,"['film', 'purest', 'example', 'film', 'poetry', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'exist', 'level', 'plot', 'yet', 'image', 'so', 'suggestive', 'things', 'beneath', 'surface', 'only', 'thing', 'comparable', 'profoundly', 'meaningful', 'haunting', 'dream.Tarkovsky', 'was', 'tormented', 'Soviet-enforced', 'exile', 'homeland', 'Russia', 'time', 'made', 'masterpiece', 'nostalgia', 'felt', 'was', 'more', 'own', 'home', 'was', 'nostalgia', 'spiritual', 'world', 'absent', 'so', 'much', 'modern', 'life', 'supremely', 'ironic', 'main', 'character', 'bitter', 'Russian', 'writer', 'felt', 'nostalgia', 'spirit', 'one', 'most', 'quot', 'spiritual', 'quot', 'places', 'earth', 'Italy', 'yet', 'frighteningly', 'appropriate', 'none', 'borrowing', 'other', 'mediums', 'literature', 'theater', 'painting', 'common', 'other', 'so-called', 'art', 'films', 'film', 'purest', 'cinema', 'can', 'exist', 'everything', 'done', 'image', 'reality', 'reality', 'character', 'own', 'world', 'transfered', 'viewer', 'means', 'most', 'intense', 'visual', 'imagination.The', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'perfect', 'roles', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'acting', 'always', 'hallmark', 'Tarkovsky', 'films', 'utter', 'realism', 'human', 'behavior', 'slightest', 'trace', 'fakery.Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'called', 'master', 'cinema', 'greatest', 'filmmakers', 'probably', 'greatest', 'film', 'essential', 'anyone', 'interested', 'medium']",Nostalghia VHS
