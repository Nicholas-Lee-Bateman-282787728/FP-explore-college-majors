The action takes a backseat to a story about, family, friendship and respect for nature. Norris has no competition in this film as he easily takes down five men at one time over and over again. This film encourages us to respect nature and show love for one another. I enjoyed this film and recommend it to anyone looking for a clean, family film for children with plenty of comical, action thrown in. This film is famous for Norris character (John McKenna) stopping a chainsaw with his bare hands. I always enjoy watching Norris battle five men at one time. It never gets old. My favorite scene is when the villain gets dragged screaming into a river by a log. Hilarious!

For me and my wife, Hood River, Parkdale, and Lost Lake on the North slope of Mount Hood in Oregon is not merely our favourite place to vacation - it's the ONLY place to vacation!Seeing the film, we recognize places we love to spend every summer that we can.On our way to Lost Lake, we fuel up at the very gas station that was featured prominently in the film.  We've rowed our boat right past the place wher the kids played in the waters of the lake with the baby bear.The Mountain you see in the film is clearly Mount Hood, the most beautiful of all the Cascade Mountains.Therefore, if having been to the lovely and serene place where this movie was made, and loving it as much as I do, gives me a built-in bias in favor of ""Forest Warrior"", then so be it.Forget about the fact that Chuck Norris, in real life, supports the very politicians who support [and get their support from] the very kind of men his character fights against in the film.  Let's just cut to the story.The young drunk father, a former Sheriff's Deputy [once a real good one, so we are told], is now living in the bottle sinc ehe and his daughter have been bandoned by his wife, and he works in the gas station when he is sober enough to stay upright.  The story of his fall and redemption plays well as it's intertwined with the fight that his daughter and her friends wage against a logging tycoon who looks at the forest and sees only dollar signs.It is this sub-plot of fall and redemption that provides a theme to the film that many others overlook, regardless of whether they praise the film or condemn it.The careful viewer will recognize Loretta Swit [""Hot Lips"" from M*A*S*H]as the owner of the gas station, and mother of two of the boys in the ""Lords of Tanglewood"" group who later take on the loggers with guerilla tactics, and the help of Chuck Norris as a shape-shifting Spirit Of The Mountain.Rent or buy this movie, but don't stop there!  Follow that with a vacation of your own to Oregon, to Hood River, and Parkdale, and Lost Lake Resort up on Mount Hood.  Get a tent and camp up there for a few days, and take it all in for yourself.Experience the place where this film was made, and then you might feel for yourself what ""Forest Warrior"" is all about.",5,Filmed on Mount Hood,1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,2340,"['reader', 'will', 'forgive', 'indulge', 'bit', ""I've-vacationed-where-this-film-was-made"", 'wife', 'Hood', 'River', 'Parkdale', 'Lost', 'Lake', 'North', 'slope', 'Mount', 'Hood', 'Oregon', 'not', 'merely', 'favourite', 'place', 'vacation', 'ONLY', 'place', 'vacation', 'Seeing', 'film', 'recognize', 'places', 'love', 'spend', 'summer', 'can.On', 'way', 'Lost', 'Lake', 'fuel', 'up', 'very', 'gas', 'station', 'was', 'featured', 'prominently', 'film', ""'ve"", 'rowed', 'boat', 'right', 'place', 'kids', 'played', 'waters', 'lake', 'baby', 'bear.The', 'Mountain', 'see', 'film', 'clearly', 'Mount', 'Hood', 'most', 'beautiful', 'Cascade', 'Mountains.Therefore', 'having', 'been', 'lovely', 'serene', 'place', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'loving', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'built-in', 'bias', 'favor', 'Forest', 'Warrior', 'then', 'so', 'be', 'it.Forget', 'fact', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'real', 'life', 'very', 'politicians', 'who', 'support', '[', 'get', 'support', ']', 'very', 'kind', 'men', 'character', 'fights', 'film', 'Let', 'just', 'cut', 'story.The', 'young', 'drunk', 'father', 'former', 'Sheriff', 'Deputy', '[', 'once', 'real', 'good', 'one', 'are', 'told', ']', 'now', 'living', 'bottle', 'sinc', 'ehe', 'daughter', 'have', 'been', 'bandoned', 'wife', 'gas', 'station', 'when', 'sober', 'enough', 'stay', 'upright', 'story', 'fall', 'redemption', 'plays', 'well', 'intertwined', 'fight', 'daughter', 'friends', 'wage', 'logging', 'tycoon', 'who', 'forest', 'only', 'dollar', 'signs.It', 'sub-plot', 'fall', 'redemption', 'theme', 'film', 'many', 'others', 'overlook', 'regardless', 'praise', 'film', 'condemn', 'it.The', 'careful', 'viewer', 'will', 'recognize', 'Loretta', 'Swit', '[', 'Hot', 'Lips', 'M*A*S*H', ']', 'owner', 'gas', 'station', 'mother', 'two', 'boys', 'Lords', 'Tanglewood', 'group', 'who', 'later', 'take', 'loggers', 'guerilla', 'tactics', 'help', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'shape-shifting', 'Spirit', 'Mountain.Rent', 'buy', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'Follow', 'vacation', 'own', 'Oregon', 'Hood', 'River', 'Parkdale', 'Lost', 'Lake', 'Resort', 'up', 'Mount', 'Hood', 'Get', 'tent', 'camp', 'up', 'there', 'few', 'days', 'take', 'yourself.Experience', 'place', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'then', 'might', 'feel', 'what', 'Forest', 'Warrior']",Forest Warrior VHS

492923,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B0000060W6,Sid the Elf,"[1, 2]","How was this movie not one of the greatest of all time? It was made in 1996, right in the golden era of B, and it was directed by the incomparable Aaron Norris yes the Aaron Norris. Taking it a step further, from the trailer you can see that Chuck morphs into both a hawk and a freaking bear. He also bought Vince Neil's hair from 1988 off ebay. Sid has been wanting to review this one for a long time and rightfully had very high expectations for it. We even thought we ensured a great viewing experience because we consulted the law firm of Chuck & Chuck. It seemed like a sure-fire 5 can effort but it was not meant to be. Don't get us wrong, this film was really b. When Chuck morphed into that bear it almost brought a tear to the eye. It should have been so sweet too but in the end they messed it all up. It was the last time street guys like Chuck were given a movie that B and turned it into an after school special.Norris Sr. even had a sweet name in this one. He is McKenna, a guy in 1875 who lives on Indian land on a mountain and refuses to sell his land to people trying to build railroad tracks through McKenna's land. So the railroad tycoons kill him. Normally that would be game over, but come on man. This is Rick James. The spirit of the mountain brings McKenna back to life and turns him into a shape shifter. 120 years later, same basic deal. Except its loggers who are messing with lone wolf McKenna's land. They want to cut down the forest, including a group of 4 kids' treehouse. But Chuck said no way. He whoops some serious logger tail but its so goofy. At one point some guy's hat even gets shot off straight from a bugs bunny cartoon. What happened to the days ofThe Hitman?As we're writing this review we realize that on paper this movie looks freaking awesome but it was a year late like the Newmanium and thus quite lame. Oooh! Chuck was his usual fantastic self. He's always the perfect blend of total tough nut and where's my cheeseballs. Throw in this special variety of mullet and kicks that missed by a mile and Chuck was pretty good in this one. We're not into bashing kids but they killed this movie. Especially the little blonde girl. She couldn't have worked long after that. It's exceedingly possible that she's gotten a creepy footrub from Santa at some point if you know what I mean. I knew that you could. Anyway, this flick was B but it was an insult to the genre. Stay away at all costs, just check out the clip of Chuck morphing into the bear.
