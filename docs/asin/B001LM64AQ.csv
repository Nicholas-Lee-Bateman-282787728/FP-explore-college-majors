The scenery is gorgeous and well photographed, the acting is fine, and the music is beautiful.  But the writing is often awkward and the characters in the series are never well defined.  Three people, really, are solving murders: Wycliffe, who is a senior policeman, a bearded assistant, and an attractive young policewoman. All we learn about the star of the series is that he is rather pleasant, calm, and intensely irreligious.  The entire film ""Last Rites"" is a particularly shrill attack upon Christianity.  The bearded cop is always eating and smoking (Why do we need closeups of his chewing, slurping and lighting up?).  The young woman is wooden enough to be featured on a daytime soap opera.Moreover, there is a total lack of humanity or humor in these films.  A coroner seems to enjoy the mutilated and frozen corpses he faces.  Wycliffe shouts at a few suspects and grimaces at corpses.  There are a few car chases to enliven the programs.  Otherwise, all is grim and nasty.  Not recommended.",3,A shade above average,1255824000,"10 18, 2009",2009,1070,"['Series', 'one', 'Wycliffe', 'not', 'compel', 'purchase', 'series', 'two', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'well', 'photographed', 'acting', 'fine', 'music', 'beautiful', 'writing', 'often', 'awkward', 'characters', 'series', 'are', 'never', 'well', 'defined', 'Three', 'people', 'really', 'are', 'solving', 'murders', 'Wycliffe', 'who', 'senior', 'policeman', 'bearded', 'assistant', 'attractive', 'young', 'policewoman', 'learn', 'star', 'series', 'rather', 'pleasant', 'calm', 'intensely', 'irreligious', 'entire', 'film', 'Last', 'Rites', 'particularly', 'shrill', 'attack', 'upon', 'Christianity', 'bearded', 'cop', 'always', 'eating', 'smoking', 'Why', 'do', 'need', 'closeups', 'chewing', 'slurping', 'lighting', 'up', 'young', 'woman', 'wooden', 'enough', 'be', 'featured', 'daytime', 'soap', 'opera.Moreover', 'total', 'lack', 'humanity', 'humor', 'films', 'coroner', 'enjoy', 'mutilated', 'frozen', 'corpses', 'Wycliffe', 'few', 'suspects', 'grimaces', 'corpses', 'are', 'few', 'car', 'chases', 'enliven', 'programs', 'Otherwise', 'grim', 'nasty', 'Not', 'recommended']",Wycliffe - Series 1

They're not really bad just not as good as we had hoped they would be. We'll continue to watch them and see if anything changes but as for right now the jury is out.I've watched this type of series mature over a season or two and hope this one might improve also; I have ""New Tricks"" in mind particularly which improved after the first season in my opinion.You may like it more than I do and it's worth checking out.",3,"Good, Not Great",1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,525,"['fans', 'British', 'mysteries', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'Wycliffe', 'were', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'series', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'watch', 'see', 'anything', 'changes', 'right', 'now', 'jury', 'out.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'type', 'series', 'mature', 'season', 'two', 'hope', 'one', 'might', 'improve', 'also', 'have', 'New', 'Tricks', 'mind', 'particularly', 'improved', 'first', 'season', 'opinion.You', 'may', 'like', 'more', 'do', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",Wycliffe - Series 1

There's not a lot of humor in it, but it's believable and well worked out. It doesn't adhere very closely to the books by W.J.

The intense focus is on the murder itself and solving it.

1214788,A16XRPF40679KG,B001LM64AQ,Michael Dobey,"[0, 0]","This is the first series of a great show in which a real to like style detective solves crimes. He is a ultra laid back detective here and most homicide detectives are like this guy laid back and calm. Ready to talk to people to find out what's going on. And this series tried to take books and make them into one hour episodes. This show does improve alot as time goes on, during this series it's decent to very good!,  but I think jack shephards low key performance is underrated by some people. The show was a hit though and worldwide did quite well so unlike some other brit shows we did get all five series on dvd! And yes you must be patient with this show. IT goes at a slow pace and the writing isn't as great at all to what this show put out in series 3-5. Those series are just GREAT! Those are just excellent series. Two is filled with more excellent shows but this one you have to be more patient with as they cram big stories into a hour. Still the acting brings it up a notch and this is a countryside detective show! NOt a large city where more radical approaches may be needed often. Anyways the picture like many 1993- 1994 tv shows has film grain but that's ok because there are no defects. The dvd set has all the eps of the first series and no extras really. this does not have the pilot episode sadly.",4,this show feels it oats here. try the later series if you don't like this one!,1308960000,"06 25, 2011",2011,1322,"['first', 'series', 'great', 'show', 'real', 'like', 'style', 'detective', 'solves', 'crimes', 'ultra', 'laid', 'back', 'detective', 'here', 'most', 'homicide', 'detectives', 'are', 'guy', 'laid', 'back', 'calm', 'Ready', 'talk', 'people', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'series', 'tried', 'take', 'books', 'make', 'one', 'hour', 'episodes', 'show', 'improve', 'alot', 'time', 'series', 'decent', 'very', 'good', 'think', 'jack', 'shephards', 'low', 'key', 'performance', 'underrated', 'people', 'show', 'was', 'hit', 'worldwide', 'did', 'quite', 'well', 'so', 'other', 'brit', 'did', 'get', 'five', 'series', 'dvd', 'yes', 'must', 'be', 'patient', 'show', 'IT', 'slow', 'pace', 'writing', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'what', 'show', 'put', 'out', 'series', '3-5', 'series', 'are', 'just', 'GREAT', 'are', 'just', 'excellent', 'series', 'Two', 'filled', 'more', 'excellent', 'shows', 'one', 'have', 'be', 'more', 'patient', 'cram', 'big', 'stories', 'hour', 'Still', 'acting', 'brings', 'up', 'notch', 'countryside', 'detective', 'show', 'large', 'city', 'where', 'more', 'radical', 'approaches', 'may', 'be', 'needed', 'often', 'picture', 'many', '1993-', '1994', 'tv', 'shows', 'film', 'grain', 'ok', 'are', 'defects', 'dvd', 'set', 'eps', 'first', 'series', 'extras', 'really', 'not', 'have', 'pilot', 'episode', 'sadly']",Wycliffe - Series 1
1214789,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B001LM64AQ,Richard B. Schwartz,"[3, 4]","I'm keeping an open mind and will see more Wycliffes, but the length of the stories (45-50 minutes) is inadequate for the form.  There is not enough time and space in which to develop characters, not enough time and space in which to develop subplots and, hence, mysteries and not enough time to linger over the lush Cornwall settings.  I'm not arguing that it's all about the time.  Frost is wonderful and only a little bit longer; Midsomer Murders are wonderful but sometimes a bit too long, but the time constraints contribute to the problem that the investigative triumvirs in Wycliffe are not particularly interesting people, the stories are not well-developed and the perps fairly obvious.  The guest actors, however, are often excellent, so that there is material on which to build.  I'm keeping an open mind, but so far I've found the series a bit dull.",2,Keeping an Open Mind,1264723200,"01 29, 2010",2010,861,"[""'m"", 'keeping', 'open', 'mind', 'will', 'see', 'more', 'Wycliffes', 'length', 'stories', '45-50', 'minutes', 'inadequate', 'form', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'space', 'develop', 'characters', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'space', 'develop', 'subplots', 'hence', 'mysteries', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'linger', 'lush', 'Cornwall', 'settings', ""'m"", 'not', 'arguing', 'time', 'Frost', 'wonderful', 'only', 'little', 'bit', 'longer', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'are', 'wonderful', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'time', 'constraints', 'contribute', 'problem', 'investigative', 'triumvirs', 'Wycliffe', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'people', 'stories', 'are', 'not', 'well-developed', 'perps', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'guest', 'actors', 'however', 'are', 'often', 'excellent', 'material', 'build', ""'m"", 'keeping', 'open', 'mind', 'so', 'far', ""'ve"", 'found', 'series', 'bit', 'dull']",Wycliffe - Series 1
