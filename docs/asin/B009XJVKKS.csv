1603075,A385SBEEJ15HHJ,B009XJVKKS,Cindy Navarro,"[1, 1]","I liked this film, but I did not love Abel's Field . One one hand, it was a moving story of a young man who was willing to do whatever it takes to take care of his younger sisters. He was not afraid to work hard, and did his best to provide a safe environment for them and make them feel loved. One scene has a football player committing a criminal offense...in my state anyway. [Goodness knows we are crazy about football too, but the boy needed to be held accountable by the witnesses.] Plus, it bothers me that no one seems overly concerned about how these children are surviving. There is an inconsistency that distracted me. I can go along with some of it, but not the entire thing.The relationship between Seth and Abel was more convincing. Both were struggling with unimaginable issues for most of us, but each provided something the other needed. Abel had withdrawn into himself and did not want to let anyone in. Many of the touches of humor sprinkled through out the film played on this aspect of his character, and I thought Sorbo showed great reactions to these situations. Seth was overwhelmed by responsibility, mistreated and/or abandoned by those who should have been helping him; He also believed that God didn't care about him. Both of these men learn that family matters, we need others, and that God can be trusted to be there even when we are having to step out on faith.""Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in hope that I would mention it on my blog.

The two main characters, Seth a high school student and Able the quiet groundskeeper at the high school, become friends through unusual circumstances.Seth shows perseverance and commitment trying to take care of his two younger sisters when his mother dies and his father and brother abandon him. You see a young man who loves his sisters and is willing to do anything to keep his family together even though they lose the house due to debt and he must work 2-3 jobs to make ends meet while attending school.Able has secrets but the two form a friendship based on hope and eventually forgiveness through believing in Jesus.

First the established Kevin Sorbo best known for the roles of Hercules in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Captain Dylan Hunt in Andromeda etc, who does not have a lot of words to say but his part is so pivotal to the two main characters and the position their lives have developed into. Second is Samuel David a young actor that I predict a very strong future for who showed his real potential in a movie titled ""New Hope"" released last year, which is well worth checking out for. Samuel's approach to his role in Abel's Field shows the depth of his acting skills, a name to really watch out for.The producers used the setting of a small town in Texas Thrall and what a first class choice it added so much to this film, no film sets all locations which added to the strength of this movie, one that I fully recommend, the story is strong many of meet difficult times in our lives, we look for a second chance and redemption!Check out ""Abel's Field"" you will not be disappointed.",5,Second Chance!

At school, he endures the daily bullying from members of the football team. At work, he struggles to earn enough money to make ends meet. At home, he has no one to turn to.When Seth fights back, he's singled out for punishment and assigned to an after-school work detail under the supervision of the reserved groundskeeper, Abel (Soul Surfer's Kevin Sorbo). Seth is surprised to discover that Abel understands his struggles ... and his dreams. Abel encourages Seth to ask out popular Katie and even steps in to babysit so Seth can go out on the date. Yet as dark circumstances lure Seth toward a desperate decision, a reluctant Abel could be the one person who points him back toward the light.Abel's FieldKevin Sorbo, Samuel DavisSometimes the heroes are on the sidelines.Rating: PG for thematic elements, brief violence, and a smoking imageHow do you know the right way?

Otherwise you're just going through the motions."" --Abel ~ Abel's FieldGet the popcorn ready and settle in! This hometown can be changed by one person who decides not ""to treat everyone alike.""

Take turns for the month. What if this was your hometown? Would you see Seth?Okay. Let's watch the movie. The scenery is wonderful, the townspeople real. You are swept up in this moving story of survival and obedience. Doing what you know to do; doing what you have to do. Seth and Abel are two unlikely friends meeting under unusual circumstances. Both being in the same place at the same time, doing what needs to be done. Mentors ~ for each other. Seth is working so hard at staying together with his little sisters. They are joyful. He is doing a good job. Against all odds, he is staying alert and following through. This movie storyline is deep and could actually be happening. Seventeen years old. Decisions to be made.

1603086,A33ERCLW7K2NSC,B009XJVKKS,"Katie McCurdy ""Legacy of a Writer""","[22, 27]","I've seen Kevin Sorbo in at least two other movies, and enjoyed each of them a LOT. But, unfortunately, Abel's Field wasn't a movie I grew to like. I kept watching, waiting to grow attached to the characters or the story plot...but couldn't. The idea behind the story was a good one, but sadly it just wasn't done very well--with the story plot, screen writing, and even some of the actors.Maybe I misunderstood, but I thought that Abel's Field was a Christian film. And while there a few times when Abel is seen in a field in what we assume is prayer, there isn't much praying until the very end when Seth finally prayers for God to fix everything  And, above all that, I just couldn't grasp what kind of town/church/friends would let this young boy try to raise two little girls on his own. I mean, he was only 17! I would have thought the state would be all over this case. And it just didn't seem realistic that Seth could leave the two girls alone for such long lengths of time---he was working 3 jobs at one time!As for mature themes, there wasn't much that I feel like I need to mention. The romance between Seth and Katie was sweet and cute. Katie's outfits were rather low and revealing in a few shots, but what surprised me the most was the plunging neckline the elderly lady at the convenience store wore. In my opinion, it wasn't at all attractive and something I would have rather not seen. So, be forewarned when those scenes come up---even though they were pretty humorous!There were just too many aspects of this movie that I didn't understand or enjoy very much. My younger siblings like it, though, and it had good music. :-) As I said before, the idea of the story---a teen boy trying to care for and keep his sisters together no matter what---was really sweet. Seth's dedication to them was really commendable, and there are a few lessons that you can get out of this movie. It just didn't gel with me all the way.

This is it.  It's full of real life drama.  You know what I mean... bullies, mortgages, grocery shopping, secrets, abandonment, family tension, bad friends, you name it.  This high school senior is really facing troubles.  It's also full of responsibility, determination, respect, and sibling love.After yet another fight with the popular high school quarterback, Seth ends up in a different kind of detention at the command of the football coach.  He's sent to help Abel, the janitor, dig up the football field and fix the sprinkler system.  Big job.  Abel's not a mechanical kind of guy, so it takes awhile, a long while.  Abel's got secrets of his own.  He's a brooding man who doesn't talk much.  As the plot progresses, questions stirred in my mind about why he was so sulky and introverted.This movie had so many layers.  There were two main characters and both stories were told concurrently.  The depth was refreshing.  Watching each man struggle with himself and his situation, interact with each other and with God, and come to conclusions was good, real good. ~smile~Ultimately, Christ was honored.

I don't often make reviews, but, in the spirit of the brethren who have helped me, I'd like to help others.  If you're interested in buying/watching this movie because you're a Christian who wants to be edified and encouraged by Christian films, than this movie is quite simply a waste of your time and money.  I have appreciated movies like ""Sheffey,"" ""Facing the Giants,"" ""The Printing,"" etc., and this one doesn't even come close to having the spiritual impact as these great films.  When my brethren asked me what this movie was about, I could hardly answer the question.  It wasn't about Christ, salvation, or sanctification.  I don't really understand what the point of it was at all.  I was disappointed by immodest clothing on teenage girls, flirty advances on a supposedly Christian man that are indulged rather than rebuked, the absolute absence of the gospel, and more.

Seth McArdle is about to learn that very lesson in the unlikeliest of places. Seeking to raise his twin younger sisters after the death of his mother and now the abandonment of his father who fails to returns phone calls or even come home to see how his family is managing. While trying to finish up high school, avoid the quarterback of the football team who seems to bully Seth whenever possible, and hold down three jobs just to put enough food on the table. Now when a man appears searching for his father, Seth learns that his father hasn't been paying the mortgage payments on the house and it's now going to be foreclosed upon if the payments are made current.When those around Seth offer help, he seems too proud to take it or even to ask for it. He is trying to find a way to keep his family together even though it's falling apart all around him. Even his brother, Keith, seems to have abandoned the responsibility of helping out when he can and instead finds solace in drinking. When Seth pushes things a bit too far with the football team, he finds himself the only one facing punishment. The football coach assigns him the task of working with Abel (Kevin Sorbo) the janitor/groundskeeper of the high school to get the sprinkler system up and working before the big game. Abel attempts to find a way to reach inside Seth and help him find the path back to God and to keep him from making some foolish mistakes that may cost him everything in the end.In the DVD, Abel's Field by Affirm Films, makers of such wonderful family films like Fireproof and Courageous, now bring you another great family film that deals with forgiveness and understanding the circumstances that life can bring about when our choices seems to much to deal with.

Sorrow,"[1, 1]","Abel's Field is a wonderful movie with an important message:That no matter what you've done,God can and will forgive you and will help you learn to forgive yourself. The two main characters,Abel(Kevin Sorbo)and Seth(Samuel Davis)are brought together under unlikely circumstances and end up teaching each other these valuable lessons,but not before Abel's secret and Seth's desperate action threaten to destroy their friendship.The performances by Sorbo and Davis are very good. For Kevin,this is a very different kind of role-he really wasn't able to put anything of himself in it as he has done with other roles because to do so would not have made sense. Abel is a loner who keeps to himself and doesn't say much when he is around people and that is what makes the bond between him & Seth so unusual!

Enough of Christian movies with the siblings picking on each other. Also his very special girlfriend and how she treats Seth and his sisters was sweet. The fact that the young man did not give up under such trying circumstances, with one nasty blow after another was also very touching.

Some real life issues are addressed here and aren't sugar coated, but has humor in the story. Just like real life sometimes humor goes along with tragedy.Seth is a young man still in high school going through all of the things associated with school, but has the added reasonability of taking care of two very young sisters. Their mother died years ago and the father just left. So Seth does his best, but feels so inadequate.Abel comes to town and works at the school and Seth has to help him as a punishment for getting into a fight. Even though Seth doesn't have all of the answers, but he has been through hard times and tragedies himself and knows what he needs to do. Abel is an excellent help to Seth, but not until many bad things begin to happen.I really like Abel's Field for its honesty, humor and the acting is very well. Also Abel's Field was filmed in a very small town under 900 people and you can see the friendliness and caring of a small town coming through in the film.I recommend you watch this film for a family fun time and a great learning experience.""Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in hope that I would mention it on my blog.

1603111,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B009XJVKKS,Wuchak,"[4, 4]","What a great drama ""Abel's Field"" is! Released in 2012, the story revolves around 17 year-old Seth (Samuel Davis) whose mother is dead and his father is no where to be found. He's forced to be the parent to his twin 7 year-old sisters. His cold half-brother is following in his father's alcoholic footprints. Seth is bullied at school by the football team and their bossy coach (Richard Dillard), but finds solace with a popular girl at school, Katie (Nicole Elliott), and -- surprisingly -- with the school's loner maintenance man, Abel (Kevin Sorbo).Like all great dramas, ""Abel's Field"" captivates your attention in the first act and you find yourself in the world of the characters. As the story progresses we discover why Seth is mistreated at school, but it's thankfully not spelled out (it has to do with jealousy, rivalry and sectarianism, the moronic ""Your not one of us"" mindset). You'll notice, incidentally, that the players only confront & attack as a group and never alone. It's a microcosm of the mob mentality, not to mention they're too cowardly to attack one-on-one.Three relationships are the focus: Seth's fatherly relationship with his sisters and his developing relationships with Katie and the mysterious Abel. Speaking of Abel, Sorbo is excellent here in an atypical role. His likable joie de vivre is completely absent in favor of a quiet, brooding spirit.The message of the film is A+ all the way and the overt references to God and faith are refreshing, but they're not so overt to turn-off those who don't believe, so don't let this factor deter you if you're amongst the latter. This is simply an inspiring film for everyone, except maybe atheists (or perhaps them most of all, lol).Those looking for a faith-based film that shows a conventional family environment might want to steer clear (not that there's anything wrong with those types of films; check out the excellent ""Cutback"" for a quality film of that sort). ""Abel's Field"" shows the awful truth of broken & dysfunctional families in the modern Western world and the negative repercussions thereof. Thankfully, that doesn't mean that there isn't any hope; but the proud individualist must be broken, both for Seth and Abel.I also like the fact that the film shows that the mentors we stumble across in life are there to mentor us in one way or another, but we shouldn't make the mistake of idolizing them, no matter how great (or small) the mentor is, he or she is still a flawed human being who just so happens to be further on in their spiritual journey, at least in the area we need help in.Another thing I liked: Just because someone's in the ""mentor"" role doesn't mean the ""mentee"" can't mentor the mentor in one way or another. And a worthy (humble) mentor will receive from the mentee when applicable.One reviewer referred to Nicole Elliott, who plays Seth's potential girlfriend, as ""overweight."" Wow, nothing could be further from the truth; in fact, this isn't even remotely true. Check her out in the film and see for yourself. It's idiotic statements like this that drive women and girls into anorexia and it totally ticks me off! If anything, Nicole could stand to gain some weight. Regardless, she's uniquely beautiful, a refreshing alternative to the stereotypical hot blond cheerleader type.The film runs 104 minutes and was shot in Thrall, TX, which is about 20 miles NE of Austin.GRADE: A",5,Breaking the rugged individualist,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,3395,"['What', 'great', 'drama', 'Abel', 'Field', 'Released', '2012', 'story', '17', 'year-old', 'Seth', 'Samuel', 'Davis', 'mother', 'dead', 'father', 'where', 'be', 'found', 'forced', 'be', 'parent', 'twin', '7', 'year-old', 'sisters', 'cold', 'half-brother', 'following', 'father', 'alcoholic', 'footprints', 'Seth', 'bullied', 'school', 'football', 'team', 'bossy', 'coach', 'Richard', 'Dillard', 'solace', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'Katie', 'Nicole', 'Elliott', 'surprisingly', 'school', 'loner', 'maintenance', 'man', 'Abel', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'great', 'dramas', 'Abel', 'Field', 'attention', 'first', 'act', 'find', 'world', 'characters', 'story', 'discover', 'why', 'Seth', 'mistreated', 'school', 'thankfully', 'not', 'spelled', 'out', 'do', 'jealousy', 'rivalry', 'sectarianism', 'moronic', 'not', 'one', 'mindset', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'incidentally', 'players', 'only', 'confront', 'attack', 'group', 'never', 'alone', 'microcosm', 'mob', 'mentality', 'not', 'mention', ""'re"", 'too', 'cowardly', 'attack', 'one-on-one.Three', 'relationships', 'are', 'focus', 'Seth', 'fatherly', 'relationship', 'sisters', 'developing', 'relationships', 'Katie', 'mysterious', 'Abel', 'Speaking', 'Abel', 'Sorbo', 'excellent', 'here', 'atypical', 'role', 'likable', 'joie', 'vivre', 'completely', 'absent', 'favor', 'quiet', 'brooding', 'spirit.The', 'message', 'film', 'A+', 'way', 'overt', 'references', 'God', 'faith', 'are', 'refreshing', ""'re"", 'not', 'so', 'overt', 'turn-off', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'factor', 'deter', ""'re"", 'latter', 'simply', 'inspiring', 'film', 'everyone', 'maybe', 'atheists', 'perhaps', 'most', 'lol', '.Those', 'looking', 'faith-based', 'film', 'conventional', 'family', 'environment', 'might', 'want', 'steer', 'clear', 'not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'types', 'films', 'check', 'excellent', 'Cutback', 'quality', 'film', 'sort', 'Abel', 'Field', 'awful', 'truth', 'broken', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'modern', 'Western', 'world', 'negative', 'repercussions', 'thereof', 'Thankfully', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'hope', 'proud', 'individualist', 'must', 'be', 'broken', 'Seth', 'Abel.I', 'also', 'fact', 'film', 'mentors', 'stumble', 'life', 'are', 'there', 'mentor', 'one', 'way', 'should', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistake', 'idolizing', 'matter', 'how', 'great', 'small', 'mentor', 'still', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'further', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'least', 'area', 'need', 'help', 'in.Another', 'thing', 'liked', 'Just', 'someone', 'mentor', 'role', ""n't"", 'mean', 'mentee', 'ca', ""n't"", 'mentor', 'mentor', 'one', 'way', 'worthy', 'humble', 'mentor', 'will', 'receive', 'mentee', 'when', 'applicable.One', 'reviewer', 'referred', 'Nicole', 'Elliott', 'who', 'Seth', 'potential', 'girlfriend', 'overweight', 'Wow', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'fact', ""n't"", 'even', 'remotely', 'true', 'Check', 'out', 'film', 'see', 'idiotic', 'statements', 'drive', 'women', 'girls', 'anorexia', 'totally', 'off', 'anything', 'Nicole', 'could', 'stand', 'gain', 'weight', 'Regardless', 'uniquely', 'beautiful', 'refreshing', 'alternative', 'stereotypical', 'hot', 'blond', 'cheerleader', 'type.The', 'film', '104', 'minutes', 'was', 'shot', 'Thrall', 'TX', '20', 'miles', 'NE', 'Austin.GRADE', 'A']",Abel's Field
