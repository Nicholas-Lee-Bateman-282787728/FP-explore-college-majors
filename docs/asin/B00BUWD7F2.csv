Waste of my money & time. I have a complete library/achieve photo's and segments of this war. I personally thought this was a joke.,2,Poorly recommended!,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,252,"['was', 'great', 'disappointment', 'segments', 'touch', 'base', 'so-called', 'secret', 'missions', 'op', 'What', 'joke', 'Waste', 'money', 'time', 'have', 'complete', 'library/achieve', 'photo', 'segments', 'war', 'personally', 'thought', 'was', 'joke']",Secrets of War - Vietnam - A War Unwanted

One thing I learned from it was that the Vietnamese approached President Wilson for help in getting the French out of their country. He refused. The Vietnamese had no other choice but to ask Russia for help.,5,good history,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,252,"['very', 'true', 'presentation', 'war', 'One', 'thing', 'learned', 'was', 'Vietnamese', 'approached', 'President', 'Wilson', 'help', 'getting', 'French', 'country', 'refused', 'Vietnamese', 'had', 'other', 'choice', 'ask', 'Russia', 'help']",Secrets of War - Vietnam - A War Unwanted
1639632,A1I5LC05HZJ9CF,B00BUWD7F2,"Kanenberg ""50kmwalk""","[5, 6]","Military history buffs like myself will really like this DVD about the Vietnam War. I learned things I didn't know about the War that surprised me. With Charlton Heston narrating I expected a 'hawk version' of events as in ""We(the US)didn't lose the War we just weren't allowed to win it"" which may very well be true. But instead, the documentary was very well balanced in its presentation of both sides of the war and it showed the ignorance and arrogance of the Gov'ts on both sides of the conflict. The DVD has no CC/subtitles but one great thing about 'Chuck Heston', he is an awesome speaker on film! I highly recommend this DVD and the other ones in the Secrets of War series.",5,Way better than expected,1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,682,"['Military', 'history', 'buffs', 'will', 'really', 'like', 'DVD', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'learned', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'War', 'surprised', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'narrating', 'expected', ""'hawk"", 'version', 'events', 'US', 'did', ""n't"", 'lose', 'War', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'win', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'true', 'instead', 'documentary', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'balanced', 'presentation', 'sides', 'war', 'showed', 'ignorance', 'arrogance', ""Gov'ts"", 'sides', 'conflict', 'DVD', 'CC/subtitles', 'one', 'great', 'thing', ""'Chuck"", 'Heston', 'awesome', 'speaker', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'other', 'ones', 'Secrets', 'War', 'series']",Secrets of War - Vietnam - A War Unwanted
