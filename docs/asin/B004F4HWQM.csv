1404727,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B004F4HWQM,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 2]","For those who have seen the ABC show ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"", both Colin Mochrie and Brad Sherwood have been entertaining people with their improv-based entertainment but also getting audience members to participate and to show how random these improv skits are.Their live stage show is so popular that they perform at sold-out shows throughout the country.  This is a comedy DVD where nothing is rehearsed, everything is spontaneous and you will no doubt laugh at what you see happen on stage.In ""Colin & Brad: Two Man Group - Live and Dangerous Comedy"", here is what to expect on this DVD:* Welcome - Both men explain improv and how anyone can do it and how their skits happen on the fly.* Moving Bodies - watch as both men pick two people from the audience who must control their bodies and improvise the storyline.* Sound FX - Both men gets suggestions by the audience to do an improv on them riding the rapids but the audience will be provided with a mic to make the sound effects and with these sound effects, both men will improvise from what those sounds.* Sideways - In this skit, the camera is above and both men are laying down on the floor (which makes them appear as they are in a correct walking stance) and improvising a skit.* One Word Expert - Both men take turns saying a word and do a skit as the Love Doctors while audiences ask love questions to them.* Jeopardy - In this skit, both men do the voices for two audience members while their mouths are opening.* Interpreter - In this skit, Colin Mochrie must do body movements based on an audience member's occupation.* Torture - In this segment known as ""The Torture Game"", an audience member reads off a list of things that Colin and Brad must improvise and take part in ""Questions Only"", where the two must speak in questions only.  For ""letter substitution"", ""s"" must be pronounced as ""k"", ""If you know what I mean"" is when the two men must use that word constantly in a sentence.* Mousetraps - In this skit, both men are blindfolded and must walk around a stage barefooted with mousetraps all over the floor and all around them strung near their head and body while they walk and improvise.* End Credits - End CreditsVIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Colin & Brad: Two Man Group - Live and Dangerous Comedy"" is presented in 169 Widescreen (1:78:1) and in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround.  Picture quality is good on DVD, because there are many skits throughout the show, there are various camera angles provided, especially since their are so many audience members that are selected to be part of the show, for the most part, there are no dizzying edits and easy to watch.  Lighting is also well done and for the most part, the presentation is pretty solid on DVD.There are no subtitles on this DVD.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Colin & Brad: Two Man Group - Live and Dangerous Comedy"" comes with the following special features:* Do's and Dont's of Improv - (6:50) Both Colin Mochrie and Brad Sherwood explain how they are able to improv and the do's and dont's of improv.* Interview with Colin Mochrie and Brad Sherwood - (5:40) Brad Sherwood interviews Colin Mochrie.JUDGMENT CALL:I am familiar with Colin Mochrie and Brad Sherwood's comedy performance on ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"" and the fact that both men were able to take this show and create a live stage show is pretty fun and exciting but the fact that they are able to connect with the audience and even get audience members to participate throughout the whole show makes it so enjoyable and hilarious.I review a lot of comedy DVD's and while this is not a DVD about stand-up comedy, it is a DVD featuring a bunch of improvisational skits that end up becoming comedy and literally, I was constantly laughing throughout the performance.  I felt as if my gut was going to burst because the skits were just off-the-top hilarious.It's hard for me to describe this DVD because unlike other comedy-DVD's where I can describe the comedian and their style of delivery or even the stage set-up, for ""Colin & Brad: Two Man Group"", the two men are awesome on stage but what makes their performance work successfully is their ability to interact with the audience and fully use audience participation.  You don't see that happening all that much, unless it's a magic show.As for content, there is no profanity but often, you will hear Brad bring up ""crotchless panties"" but that is probably the extent of anything that may be too over-the-top for those who may wonder if they can watch this comedy DVD with children.  I will say that in the audience, you will see many parents with their older children at the show.The DVD is straightforward and you get two special features with the guys messing around and having fun.  In fact, there are not too many comedy DVD's where I enjoy everything from beginning to end.  Most, you will either like part of it, half of it but for this DVD, the whole performance was hilarious and I can easily say that you will get your money's worth.So, overall, If you are looking for a comedy DVD that is easy to get into and one that you can just laugh out loud and have fun watching it, I highly recommend ""Colin & Brad: Two Man Group - Live and Dangerous Comedy"".  Definitely recommended!",5,Hilarious!!!!  And the fact that it's under $8 on Amazon is fantastic!,1302652800,"04 13, 2011",2011,5221,"['who', 'have', 'seen', 'ABC', 'show', 'Whose', 'Line', 'Anyway', 'Colin', 'Mochrie', 'Brad', 'Sherwood',

1404728,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004F4HWQM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","For many years (a long, long time ago), I was obsessed with the delightful British improv show ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"" I forced almost anyone who came into my home to partake in the madcap hilarity. While I certainly appreciated Drew Carey's Americanized edition, Carey was easily the weakest link and made the obvious point that improv isn't easy. But with such talented regular performers, it was permissible to forgive Carey for his less experienced and less successful experimentation. Now, in the aftermath of that show--two of its most appealing actors take their brand of rogue improvisation to the masses. In a filmed theater piece, ""Colin & Brad: Two Man Group"" brings Brad Sherwood and Colin Mochrie into the limelight for a hysterical evening of familiar concepts and new inspirations. The intimate stage show involves plenty of audience participation and, in a word, is simply funny!You've got some stunts you've seen before such as people manipulating their body movements and providing sound effects. Both of these come of quite well and set the stage for some new moves. I particularly loved a sideways theater bit where the two lie on the ground and are filmed from above. So simple, but genius. And the grand finale provides the World's Most Dangerous Improv involving blindfolds and hundreds of mouse traps. So silly, but genius. As with much improv, some of the skits are limited by the audience participation and this can result in hilarious ineptitude (such as the movement opener) or derail a great bit (I talking about you--mall cop!). Occasionally a bit will go on a beat too long--but this is near perfection and will surely delight everyone. If you were a fan of ""Line"" than I can't recommend this highly enough!If you like this type of comedy, you won't want to miss this!

1404730,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004F4HWQM,Mark Turner,"[4, 4]","When WHO'S LINE IS IT ANYWAY? premiered on television I thought it was one of the best shows around. I've always loved improve comedy. It started when I saw SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE the first time only to learn that most of the cast began at Second City in Chicago. In college I got my first taste of Second City and fell in love with it, making it a point to visit each time I go there now.But WHOSE LINE brought weekly improv to the small screen and made me laugh. Not once in a while but every single episode I watched. And while they had a number of talented individuals on the show, my favorite was Colin Mochrie. Mochrie was teased about his baldness and being Canadian each week but he dished back with a terrific sense of humor and comedic timing. So imagine my delight to hear that he was touring with Brad Sherwood across the county. While I didn't get to their show, I can now enjoy watching them whenever I want with the release of COLIN MOCHRIE & BRAD SHERWOOD: TWO MAN GROUP.This is a taped concert film basically of the dynamic duo of quick wits displaying their comic talents. The pieces they do are not scripted and haven't been set up in advance. They're doing improv where they come out, take a few suggestions such as an event and then apply the event to different improv games that have been used for years.They begin with a game that features the two of them unable to move without the assistance of a couple they bring up from the audience. Each movement they make is done by these two ordinary people moving their various body parts which often leads to both embarrassing and funny pieces.They do a sequence called sideways sketch where they take a suggestion from the audience of a situation (in this case a man upset with his neighbor because his dog poops in his yard) and make comedy of it. The thing is that they're actually lying on the floor with a prop stage featuring a camera overhead making it look like by rolling across the floor they're moving across the set.There are a number of other items they perform here, ending with what Sherwood describes as the most dangerous piece to perform. The stage is set with 225 every day mousetraps placed several inches apart. Brad and Colin then remove their shoes and socks and place blindfolds on. When Colin suggests that this isn't really dangerous, another 25 mousetraps hanging by threads are lowered, some about chest level, others nearer definitely sensitive areas. They then do an alphabet game where they perform a suggested event (a man upset that his next door neighbor takes his mail) in operatic format, each using the next letter of the alphabet to start their line. The ensuing snapping of the traps and gags is the result.This show was quite enjoyable and funny, making me laugh so hard a few times that I had to back up or pause the disc. Then again I've always found these two men to be two of the funniest guys on the planet, even more so when doing improv.The DVD release also features two special items that include interviews with the stars in set pieces. These are funny to an extent, but the true laughs are when they're on stage together.I did find one thing that truly upset me with this DVD release though. That's the fact that it only lasted 67 minutes. Once it finishes you find yourself wanting more. If you weren't a fan of WHOSE LINE you might find this mildly amusing. If you were a fan you will want this in your collection. There are a few items that might not be child friendly, but for the most part if you have children you should be safe. Even they'll get a laugh out of this one.",5,TOO MUCH FUN,1300147200,"03 15, 2011",2011,3591,"['When', 'WHO', 'LINE', 'IS', 'IT', 'ANYWAY', 'premiered', 'television', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'improve', 'comedy', 'started', 'when', 'saw', 'SATURDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIVE', 'first', 'time', 'only', 'learn', 'most', 'cast', 'began', 'Second', 'City', 'Chicago', 'college', 'got', 'first', 'taste', 'Second', 'City', 'fell', 'love', 'making', 'point', 'visit', 'time', 'go', 'there', 'now.But', 'WHOSE', 'LINE', 'brought', 'weekly', 'improv', 'small', 'screen', 'made', 'laugh', 'Not', 'once', 'while', 'single', 'episode', 'watched', 'had', 'number', 'talented', 'individuals', 'show', 'favorite', 'was', 'Colin', 'Mochrie', 'Mochrie', 'was', 'teased', 'baldness', 'being', 'Canadian', 'week', 'dished', 'back', 'terrific', 'sense', 'humor', 'comedic', 'timing', 'So', 'imagine', 'delight', 'hear', 'was', 'touring', 'Brad', 'Sherwood', 'county', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'show', 'can', 'now', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'whenever', 'want', 'release', 'COLIN', 'MOCHRIE', 'BRAD', 'SHERWOOD', 'TWO', 'MAN', 'GROUP.This', 'taped', 'concert', 'film', 'basically', 'dynamic', 'duo', 'quick', 'wits', 'displaying', 'comic', 'talents', 'pieces', 'do', 'are', 'not', 'scripted', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'set', 'up', 'advance', ""'re"", 'doing', 'improv', 'where', 'come', 'out', 'take', 'few', 'suggestions', 'such', 'event', 'then', 'apply', 'event', 'different', 'improv', 'games', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'years.They', 'begin', 'game', 'two', 'unable', 'move', 'assistance', 'couple', 'bring', 'up', 'audience', 'movement', 'make', 'done', 'two', 'ordinary', 'people', 'moving', 'various', 'body', 'parts', 'often', 'embarrassing', 'funny', 'pieces.They', 'do', 'sequence', 'called', 'sideways', 'sketch', 'where', 'take', 'suggestion', 'audience', 'situation', 'case', 'man', 'upset', 'neighbor', 'dog', 'poops', 'yard', 'make', 'comedy', 'thing', ""'re"", 'actually', 'lying', 'floor', 'prop', 'stage', 'featuring', 'camera', 'overhead', 'making', 'look', 'rolling', 'floor', ""'re"", 'moving', 'set.There', 'are', 'number', 'other', 'items', 'perform', 'here', 'ending', 'what', 'Sherwood', 'most', 'dangerous', 'piece', 'perform', 'stage', 'set', '225', 'day', 'placed', 'several', 'inches', 'apart', 'Brad', 'Colin', 'then', 'remove', 'shoes', 'socks', 'place', 'blindfolds', 'When', 'Colin', ""n't"", 'really', 'dangerous', '25', 'mousetraps', 'hanging', 'threads', 'are', 'lowered', 'chest', 'level', 'others', 'nearer', 'definitely', 'sensitive', 'areas', 'then', 'do', 'alphabet', 'game', 'where', 'perform', 'suggested', 'event', 'man', 'upset', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'mail', 'operatic', 'format', 'using', 'next', 'letter', 'alphabet', 'start', 'line', 'ensuing', 'snapping', 'traps', 'gags', 'result.This', 'show', 'was', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'funny', 'making', 'so', 'hard', 'few', 'times', 'had', 'back', 'up', 'pause', 'disc', 'Then', 'again', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'two', 'men', 'be', 'two', 'funniest', 'guys', 'planet', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'doing', 'improv.The', 'DVD', 'release', 'also', 'two', 'special', 'items', 'include', 'interviews', 'stars', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'funny', 'extent', 'true', 'laughs', 'are', 'when', ""'re"", 'stage', 'together.I', 'did', 'find', 'one', 'thing', 'truly', 'upset', 'DVD', 'release', 'though', 'fact', 'only', 'lasted', '67', 'minutes', 'find', 'wanting', 'more', 'were', ""n't"", 'fan', 'WHOSE', 'LINE', 'might', 'find', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'were', 'fan', 'will', 'want', 'collection', 'are', 'few', 'items', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'child', 'friendly', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'children', 'should', 'be', 'safe', 'Even', ""'ll"", 'get', 'laugh', 'one']",Colin & Brad: Two Man Group
