Some might enjoy it and I can see how they might. For me however, he did too many weak jokes that I have heard before ad nauseum. He cusses way too much and for no reason at all. Don't get me wrong, I am no prude, and yes, I do enjoy cussing, but I like it to be done in context. Eddie cusses for the sake of it, without being funny. I find it a tad disappointing because he truly is among the top 10 comedians working today.His other work is far superior to this.",2,Not god enough,1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,569,"['Eddie', 'terrific', 'comedian', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'brought', 'out', 'drivel', 'standards', 'might', 'enjoy', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'might', 'however', 'did', 'too', 'many', 'weak', 'jokes', 'have', 'heard', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'reason', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'am', 'prude', 'yes', 'do', 'enjoy', 'cussing', 'like', 'be', 'done', 'context', 'Eddie', 'sake', 'being', 'funny', 'find', 'tad', 'disappointing', 'truly', 'top', '10', 'comedians', 'working', 'today.His', 'other', 'work', 'far', 'superior']",N/A
