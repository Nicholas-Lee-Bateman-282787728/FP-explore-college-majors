This is one of the absolute triumphs of Japanese anime collections for anyone into the genre to have in their possession... this is one to pass on to the grandkids!!! Yess  sirreee!  It is THAT GOOD. (COTS &) the BOTS series is an anime's anime.  What more can I say than: GET THIS!  WATCH THIS!  And when you get feeling down or just want a good something to watch... dig it out and put it in the player... it never has gotten to the 'tired of it' stage for me.  I think if I were an anime character I would choose this series... and Admiral Spoor would have a character courting her, seriously!

846935,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B0002VEVOI,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[32, 32]","I remember way back when watching Crest of the Stars for the first time, feeling somewhat bored as the lengthy narration and, explanations of technology, and setup of the complex politics took place whilst the main characters were introduced and then slowly developed. Of course Crest of the Stars is an amazing piece of work once you get into it, and only gets better with each viewing. What once seemed to be boring now is thought-provoking, and characters reveal more depth to me the more I try to understand them. The second series, Banner of the Stars, was an almost entirely different animal. Instead of the slow pacing of the original, it had loads of great dialog among key players, and so many battles that I felt completely exhausted by the end. This series is the last of the trilogy, and I was starting to wonder how the series was going to end by the time I finally got around to watching it. I needn't have worried.Now that we have come to understand Abh thinking, Abh politics, and Abh life, you could say that the story is really kicking into high gear as far as the two lead characters are concerned. While in the first series Lafiel and Jinto were teenagers who thought more like kids, and in the second they were more like teenagers trying to act like adults, they are now at the point where they are, and act like, adults. Jinto is no longer uncomfortable when people refer to him as count Hyde, and Lafiel is no longer so self-conscious and over-doing it in her efforts to live up to her family's name. Now count Hyde is becoming something of a skilled diplomat, and Lafiel has gained the confidence she needs to become an excellent captain. They aren't kids helping each other out of dangerous situations or teens learning to trust each other. Now they are old friends who know each other quite well...and maybe more.For this series, it seems like an extra coat of polish was applied to everything. The new remixed themes of some of the scores are simply magnificent, the visuals take a significant jump forward in quality over the second series (and everything is in widescreen to boot), and the dialog, camera angles, and overall feel of the show is much tighter this time around. We don't need any lengthy explanations of Abh technology anymore, and as a result we are free to learn more about the Abh code of honor and ethics, and how sometimes that code requires making incredible sacrifices.The overall story revolves around how Lafiel and Jinto find themselves negotiating with the government of a recently conquered territory, only to find out that it is a prison planet on the brink of civil war. As the enemy approaches, Jinto and Lafiel both have to take a stand for what they believe to be right and for me the best character defining moments of the trilogy are all in this series.While there are fewer episodes in this series than in the previous two (which may contribute to the tight feeling and lack of filler episodes), but this is made up for by the bonus episode ""Birth"", which deals with Lafiel's parents, and how she was born. The end of Banner of the Stars II is highly satisfying, as things truly have come full circle for the two lead characters, a chapter of their life is ending, and another is beginning. For fans of the previous two Stars series, this is required viewing.",5,Things have finally come full circle,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,3322,"['remember', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'watching', 'Crest', 'Stars', 'first', 'time', 'feeling', 'somewhat', 'bored', 'lengthy', 'narration', 'explanations', 'technology', 'setup', 'complex', 'politics', 'took', 'place', 'whilst', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'introduced', 'then', 'slowly', 'developed', 'course', 'Crest', 'Stars', 'amazing', 'piece', 'work', 'once', 'get', 'only', 'better', 'viewing', 'What', 'once', 'seemed', 'be', 'boring', 'now', 'thought-provoking', 'characters', 'reveal', 'more', 'depth', 'more', 'try', 'understand', 'second', 'series', 'Banner', 'Stars', 'was', 'almost', 'entirely', 'different', 'animal', 'Instead', 'slow', 'pacing', 'original', 'had', 'loads', 'great', 'dialog', 'key', 'players', 'so', 'many', 'battles', 'felt', 'completely', 'exhausted', 'end', 'series', 'last', 'trilogy', 'was', 'starting', 'wonder', 'how', 'series', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'time', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'worried.Now', 'have', 'come', 'understand', 'Abh', 'thinking', 'Abh', 'politics', 'Abh', 'life', 'could', 'say', 'story', 'really', 'kicking', 'high', 'gear', 'as', 'far', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'concerned', 'first', 'series', 'Lafiel', 'Jinto', 'were', 'teenagers', 'who', 'thought', 'more', 'kids', 'second', 'were', 'more', 'teenagers', 'trying', 'act', 'adults', 'are', 'now', 'point', 'where', 'are', 'act', 'adults', 'Jinto', 'no', 'longer', 'uncomfortable', 'when', 'people', 'refer', 'count', 'Hyde', 'Lafiel', 'no', 'longer', 'so', 'self-conscious', 'over-doing', 'efforts', 'live', 'up', 'family', 'name', 'Now', 'count', 'Hyde', 'becoming', 'something', 'skilled', 'diplomat', 'Lafiel', 'gained', 'confidence', 'become', 'excellent', 'captain', 'are', ""n't"", 'kids', 'helping', 'other', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'teens', 'learning', 'trust', 'other', 'Now', 'are', 'old', 'friends', 'who', 'know', 'other', 'quite', 'well', 'maybe', 'more.For', 'series', 'extra', 'coat', 'polish', 'was', 'applied', 'everything', 'new', 'remixed', 'themes', 'scores', 'are', 'simply', 'magnificent', 'visuals', 'take', 'significant', 'jump', 'forward', 'quality', 'second', 'series', 'everything', 'widescreen', 'boot', 'dialog', 'camera', 'angles', 'overall', 'feel', 'show', 'much', 'tighter', 'time', 'around', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'lengthy', 'explanations', 'Abh', 'technology', 'anymore', 'result', 'are', 'free', 'learn', 'more', 'Abh', 'code', 'honor', 'ethics', 'how', 'sometimes', 'code', 'making', 'incredible', 'sacrifices.The', 'overall', 'story', 'revolves', 'how', 'Lafiel', 'Jinto', 'find', 'negotiating', 'government', 'recently', 'conquered', 'territory', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'prison', 'planet', 'brink', 'civil', 'war', 'enemy', 'approaches', 'Jinto', 'Lafiel', 'have', 'take', 'stand', 'what', 'believe', 'be', 'right', 'best', 'character', 'defining', 'moments', 'trilogy', 'are', 'series.While', 'are', 'fewer', 'episodes', 'series', 'previous', 'two', 'may', 'contribute', 'tight', 'feeling', 'lack', 'filler', 'episodes', 'made', 'up', 'bonus', 'episode', 'Birth', 'Lafiel', 'parents', 'how', 'was', 'born', 'end', 'Banner', 'Stars', 'II', 'highly', 'satisfying', 'things', 'truly', 'have', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'chapter', 'life', 'ending', 'beginning', 'fans', 'previous', 'two', 'Stars', 'series', 'required', 'viewing']",Banner of the Stars II - Complete Collection
846936,A10U58PHFDK81C,B0002VEVOI,The Anime  Adict,"[2, 2]","Banners of the Stars II is the final installment of the Crest of the Stars franchise and by this time feels like an old friend to those of us who have watched the first two series. If you haven't then don't worry you don't need to watch the others to grasp what's happening though it does help. In my opinion this is the best of the three. There is noticeably less action then in either of the previous series. Jinto is less of a twit in this one though he's still not the invincible knight, just an honorable guy. Speaking of Jinto he gets into another life or death situation, but this time Lafiel can't save him. Does he live does he die, I'm not going to tell you because that would kill the suspense of the entire series. If you've watched the last two series then you know what to expect, perfection, and it lives up to that expectation. The only difference is that this one runs has no meandering or slow pacing, everything happens quickly. Also Jinto's and Lafiel's relationship finally comes to a head though not in the usual manner. It's a good showing of the old saying absence makes the heart grow fonder. If you have watched either of the last two series then this ones a must.
