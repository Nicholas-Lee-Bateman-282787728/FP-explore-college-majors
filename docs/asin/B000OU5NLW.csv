1065432,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B000OU5NLW,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","""Quid pro quo, Clarice.""  OK, so maybe Vera Farmiga -- who gives a very nice performance, as usual -- maybe isn't quite as off her rocker here as Hannibal Lecter, but it's close.  She seems to want something that no one should want.Pretty early on in this mildly-disturbing film, I started thinking about why a parapalegic would take offense if a non-disabled person wanted to become wheelchair bound.  It didn't take long to think about this, and I came up with the following most-likely truth:  the able-bodied person is trivializing the struggles that the parapalegic endures by thinking this way.  If the parapalegic could have his way, he'd be out of that wheelchair faster than you can say, ""Lickety split.""And this is the psychological setup for the film ""Quid Pro Quo,"" at least for the audience, or at least for me.  I have heard about actual people who want to become disabled for no apparent reason.  For real, there was this guy who went to the doctor to ask to have one of his legs removed, below the knee, and there was nothing wrong with the patient's leg.  The doctor correctly refused.  Later, the patient wanted it gone so bad he put his foot in a bucket of dry ice, and gangrene set it.  The doctor then had no choice but to remove it.  The patient got his way, I suppose.But this film has another possible theme going on.  Is it possible that one person could start walking if another person lost the ability to walk?  And would it be fair play if someone that did someone else harm receive a similar punishment?  Would it make everything ""square?""This film is surely not for everyone; some people will undoubtedly be turned off or offended I suppose.  But very nice performances by the leads leads us to a pretty thought-provoking film.  And a fairly strong recommendation by me.",4,Stranger than Hannibal Lecter?,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,1800,"['Quid', 'pro', 'quo', 'Clarice', 'OK', 'maybe', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'who', 'very', 'nice', 'performance', 'usual', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'quite', 'off', 'rocker', 'here', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'close', 'want', 'something', 'one', 'should', 'want.Pretty', 'early', 'mildly-disturbing', 'film', 'started', 'thinking', 'about', 'why', 'parapalegic', 'would', 'take', 'offense', 'non-disabled', 'person', 'wanted', 'become', 'wheelchair', 'bound', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'think', 'came', 'up', 'following', 'most-likely', 'truth', 'able-bodied', 'person', 'trivializing', 'struggles', 'parapalegic', 'endures', 'thinking', 'way', 'parapalegic', 'could', 'have', 'way', ""'d"", 'be', 'wheelchair', 'faster', 'can', 'say', 'Lickety', 'split', 'psychological', 'setup', 'film', 'Quid', 'Pro', 'Quo', 'least', 'audience', 'least', 'have', 'heard', 'actual', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'become', 'disabled', 'apparent', 'reason', 'real', 'was', 'guy', 'who', 'went', 'doctor', 'ask', 'have', 'one', 'legs', 'removed', 'knee', 'was', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'patient', 'leg', 'doctor', 'correctly', 'refused', 'Later', 'patient', 'wanted', 'gone', 'so', 'bad', 'put', 'foot', 'bucket', 'dry', 'ice', 'gangrene', 'set', 'doctor', 'then', 'had', 'choice', 'remove', 'patient', 'got', 'way', 'suppose.But', 'film', 'possible', 'theme', 'going', 'possible', 'one', 'person', 'could', 'start', 'walking', 'person', 'lost', 'ability', 'walk', 'would', 'be', 'fair', 'play', 'someone', 'did', 'someone', 'else', 'harm', 'receive', 'similar', 'punishment', 'Would', 'make', 'everything', 'square', 'film', 'surely', 'not', 'everyone', 'people', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'offended', 'suppose', 'very', 'nice', 'performances', 'leads', 'pretty', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'fairly', 'strong', 'recommendation']",Quid Pro Quo
1065433,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B000OU5NLW,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[1, 1]","This film had a lot going for it initially; really cool voice over; beautiful visuals of, what we find out later, is a tulip field and red tulips; a twist and turn here and there; and flashbacks. About 20 minutes into the film it jumps the shark. The intrigue totally disappears, bad acting creeps in, and the story just doesn't hold together. Vera Farminga turns in one of the poorest performances I've seen in a long time, she appears to be reading her lines. Nick Stahl does a decent job as a parapalegic.I really didn't care for this film at all. There was no intrigue, the mystery is so obvious. The payoff at the end is just sad. And the magic shoes... Ah, it was just really poor story telling and a mystery that just doesn't work.The topic was intriguing. People that are able bodied but want to become handicapped. OK, that was understood about half way through this film. It's a way of life, not a disease or some sexual oddity. The trouble at the end of this film, it simply falls back into the stereotypes we all entered the film with. I'm not sure I learned or cared much by the time the hour and a half was up.There is something really special about this DVD. The first 15 minutes of ""Whole Documentary"" is included in the special features. Now that film looks to be an incredible movie about this topic. Treated with care and love, without the awful back story and ending of Quid Pro Quo. Please go here to read reviews:WholeThe rest of the bonus features are pitiful, deleted scenes that should have never seen the light of day. And the casting call for Nick and Vera.This is an R rated movie for no real reason. If the two scenes with Nick and Vera had been deleted (and the film wouldn't have suffered one bit) this would be PG. There is no nudity in either scene. I also take significant issue with the film cover. The woman in the wheel chair is not even in this film. It plays even heavier into the idea that this way of life is some bizare fetish. It's unfortunate to see how films are marketed.I just can't recommend this film.",2,Not Good,1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,2050,"['film', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'initially', 'really', 'cool', 'voice', 'beautiful', 'visuals', 'what', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'tulip', 'field', 'red', 'tulips', 'twist', 'turn', 'here', 'there', 'flashbacks', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'shark', 'intrigue', 'totally', 'bad', 'acting', 'creeps', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'hold', 'together', 'Vera', 'Farminga', 'one', 'poorest', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'be', 'reading', 'lines', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'decent', 'job', 'parapalegic.I', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'film', 'was', 'intrigue', 'mystery', 'so', 'obvious', 'payoff', 'end', 'just', 'sad', 'magic', 'shoes', 'Ah', 'was', 'just', 'really', 'poor', 'story', 'telling', 'mystery', 'just', ""n't"", 'work.The', 'topic', 'was', 'intriguing', 'People', 'are', 'able', 'bodied', 'want', 'become', 'handicapped', 'OK', 'was', 'understood', 'way', 'film', 'way', 'life', 'not', 'disease', 'sexual', 'oddity', 'trouble', 'end', 'film', 'simply', 'back', 'stereotypes', 'entered', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'learned', 'cared', 'much', 'time', 'hour', 'half', 'was', 'up.There', 'something', 'really', 'special', 'DVD', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'Whole', 'Documentary', 'included', 'special', 'features', 'Now', 'film', 'be', 'incredible', 'movie', 'topic', 'Treated', 'care', 'love', 'awful', 'back', 'story', 'ending', 'Quid', 'Pro', 'Quo', 'Please', 'go', 'here', 'read', 'reviews', 'WholeThe', 'rest', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'pitiful', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'casting', 'call', 'Nick', 'Vera.This', 'R', 'rated', 'movie', 'real', 'reason', 'two', 'scenes', 'Nick', 'Vera', 'had', 'been', 'deleted', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'suffered', 'one', 'bit', 'would', 'be', 'PG', 'nudity', 'scene', 'also', 'take', 'significant', 'issue', 'film', 'cover', 'woman', 'wheel', 'chair', 'not', 'even', 'film', 'even', 'heavier', 'idea', 'way', 'life', 'bizare', 'fetish', 'unfortunate', 'see', 'how', 'films', 'are', 'marketed.I', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film']",Quid Pro Quo

Interestingly, Isaac is a paraplegic, confined to a wheelchair since age 8 when he was the survivor of a car crash that killed both his parents.  He has full function of most of his body, but cannot walk.  Isaac receives an email from one 'Ancient Chinese Girl' that contains a message about a person who convinced a doctor to amputate a normal leg. Isaac is fascinated and sets out to investigate the story and eventually discovers the source of the email - one young and very beautiful Fiona (Vera Farmiga) - who introduces him to a subculture of people who want to be wheelchair bound: in a group meeting Isaac hears strange stories from a disparate group of people who meet to discuss their obsession with being paralyzed, their chance to be noticed and cared about as quasi-invalids who would go so far as having an amputation of a normal limb to enable their wheelchair dreams.Isaac soon discovers that Fiona shares this obsession, demonstrates her secrets to Isaac, and the two begin to bond physically and emotionally.  Isaac is the first person to see Fiona make her 'debut' in public in a wheelchair.  They share lunch in a caf&eacute; and  share their life experiences: Isaac confesses that he harbors foreshortened memory of his accident - his last memory is lying in the road seeing a young girl with red and white pompoms trying to save him.  Isaac surprises himself (and shares his surprise with Fiona) when he buys a pair of 'Fred Astaire shoes', and upon trying them on, he is able to walk!  Fiona's response is mixed - she is happy that Isaac is ambulatory but at the same time she is led to believe that Isaac's paralysis may be of an hysterical nature, that he really has never been paralyzed except as a reaction to the guilt he harbors about his parent's death and his sole survivorship of the accident.  How these two people deal with the information as it develops provides a startling ending to this story, a detective mystery that in retrospect proves to have given us, the audience, countless clues throughout the film - clues only discovered in retrospect!Both Nick Stahl and Vera Farmiga give vital performances, able to draw us in to their odd characters and make us care.  There are many fine cameo roles - Kate Burton as Fiona's mother, James Frain as Isaac's priest friend, and all the members of the wannabe wheelchair bound group - and the cinematography by Michael McDonough is both appropriately claustrophobic indoors and transcendently beautiful in the tulip fields of Skagit Valley, WA used as the setting for the upstate New York accident location.  Mark Mothersbaugh ties the moods of the film together with his expert musical score.  This is a tough little film to watch, but a film that supplies much gratification and challenge.  It is a fine debut for Carlos Brooks. Recommended.

In the most extreme cases, some will even go so far as to stage accidents, endure amputations or employ special drugs to turn their fantasy into reality.  And, like anyone who's harboring a deep, dark secret from a critical world, these people are forced to live their lives in the closet, terrified that they will be rejected by those they care most about if they reveal the truth of who they really are inside.Isaac Knott (Nick Stahl) has been a paraplegic since he was a teen, the result of a car accident in which both his parents were killed.  He's now a reporter for a local radio station and it is through an assignment for his work that he meets a group of able-bodied ""wannabes,"" as well as an attractive young woman named Fiona (Vera Farmiga from ""Up in the Air"") who desperately wants to live life in a wheelchair and implores Isaac to help her achieve that goal.This quiet and gentle, though emotionally complex, film rises above its potentially tricky subject matter through insightful performances, sensitive writing, and a plot that nicely dovetails into itself in the second half.

1065444,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B000OU5NLW,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[13, 18]","This film keeps getting the trailer and media exposure of being another Crash-esque (1995) style film with a serious coverage of psychotic ""wannabes"" that wish for physical/medical impairments. And it almost appears  that way in the beginning, but as you make it through all of those uncomfortable sexual moments what transpires is another come-to-terms film of emotional withholdings.Vera Farmiga and Nich Stahl lead this film of exploration and in the end, twists of forgiveness and moving forward. Vera's performance was forced and seemed on fast forward at times, but she still looks elegant on the screen. Nick appears to be creating a name for himself so I would recommend the film especially for his fan base.Technically, the intermittent flashbacks of tulip fields and the opening color montage during the credits would make for a great Blu display, but the remainder of the film is mostly filled with browns, silvers and darks. The DVD contains footage from the Whole documentary, deleted scenes, a tulip montage to some nice music, and most importantly - the alternate ending that was significantly better. Several ladies were watching this with me and they felt the film was ruined with the corny ending that is in the film now, but the alternate was much more appropriate and gave the whole (deleted) love story much needed closure.I have noticed in other reviews that any topics touching the disabilities, psychosis, or challenges shown in the film spur ugly debates. Putting all of that aside, it is a watchable film with a good twist ending that should keep the masses slightly entertained.",3,Twisted little film that would look great in BD...,1219017600,"08 18, 2008",2008,1605,"['film', 'getting', 'trailer', 'media', 'exposure', 'being', 'Crash-esque', '1995', 'style', 'film', 'serious', 'coverage', 'psychotic', 'wannabes', 'wish', 'physical/medical', 'impairments', 'almost', 'way', 'beginning', 'make', 'uncomfortable', 'sexual', 'moments', 'what', 'come-to-terms', 'film', 'emotional', 'withholdings.Vera', 'Farmiga', 'Nich', 'Stahl', 'lead', 'film', 'exploration', 'end', 'twists', 'forgiveness', 'moving', 'forward', 'Vera', 'performance', 'was', 'forced', 'seemed', 'fast', 'forward', 'times', 'still', 'elegant', 'screen', 'Nick', 'be', 'creating', 'name', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'especially', 'fan', 'base.Technically', 'intermittent', 'flashbacks', 'tulip', 'fields', 'opening', 'color', 'montage', 'credits', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'Blu', 'display', 'remainder', 'film', 'mostly', 'filled', 'browns', 'silvers', 'darks', 'DVD', 'footage', 'Whole', 'documentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'tulip', 'montage', 'nice', 'music', 'most', 'importantly', 'alternate', 'ending', 'was', 'significantly', 'better', 'Several', 'ladies', 'were', 'watching', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'ruined', 'corny', 'ending', 'film', 'now', 'alternate', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'appropriate', 'gave', 'whole', 'deleted', 'love', 'story', 'much', 'needed', 'closure.I', 'have', 'noticed', 'other', 'reviews', 'topics', 'touching', 'disabilities', 'psychosis', 'challenges', 'shown', 'film', 'spur', 'ugly', 'Putting', 'aside', 'watchable', 'film', 'good', 'twist', 'ending', 'should', 'keep', 'masses', 'slightly', 'entertained']",Quid Pro Quo

1065446,AB1CKA6B849SP,B000OU5NLW,zeus,"[0, 0]","I was first intrigued about the condition described in the movie and I thought it was just fiction. Then I did a search about people who WANT to be amputees. Yes, really unusual, but I came across real people, and a real condition. I read about a guy who is a chemist and he put both his legs in dry ice for six hours until the tissue died and had to have both legs amputated. So IT IS a real condition that makes psychiatrists scratch their heads! There are a bunch of people with this condition out there.The movie is surprisingly good. The end is totally not predictable and jaw dropping. The acting as far as Vera Farmiga is concerned is outstanding. Nick Stahl is OK, not very convincing as a paraplegic.Briefly, Isaac, a journalist is a paraplegic that was in a car accident when he was young and his parents died. Somebody sends him messages about a group of people that pretend being paraplegic. After several emails, he meets the person (Fiona) and there is a little bit of a love story for a while. The bizarre turning point of the movie is when he buys a pair of shoes that allows him to walk again. At first it looks out of place but...I will stop here! I don't want to give more of the movie up. Just remember, it is not a science fiction movie.At the very end of the movie we understand what is going on and the reason that both Fiona and Isaac feel bad in their life and what kind of baggage they are carrying. Highly recommended if you like to be surprised at the very end of a movie! Five stars all around for a very interesting movie.Just a note to the person who cut several scenes shown under deleted scenes. Huge mistake! All deleted scenes belong in the movie. Why taking them out?",5,Good solid movie.
