1112365,AA2MOLT8YF3P2,B000WW1YPG,David Falzano,"[0, 0]","First & foremost I am a HUGE Rob Halford fan...his work with Priest, Halford, & Fight has been awesome (Fight/Halford for his HEAVY/AGGRESSIVE music & Priest for his more melodic/upbeat metal side.) As for Fight specifically, I, like many other fans really wish there were more CDs from this band because it was Rob Halford's most crushing material of his career & it truly showed how he was determined to carry metal in a heavier direction but without going too extreme to satisfy fans in all walks of the genre. Now here we are many many years later & Fight has been resurrected along with this new DVD/CD 'War of Words' which shows footage of the band's beginnings, everywhere from Halford himself discussing about the band getting together, showing rehearsal footage, & showing the band playing on stage live. This isn't very long but it's still satisfying to see how the Fight saga began! Next there is the concert for Fight's first full length album 'War of Words.' Yes, it is made up of footage from various shows but it is made to look like one show & in my opinion I think it was a pretty good job considering how much footage had to be worked with & it wasn't all high quality. As for the audio, it sounds like it is taken from 1 show but even if that's not the case it still sounds pretty damn good! The only so so part of this package is the 'War of Words' remastered/remixed CD. I think Halford ""cleaned up"" the disc to sound more like his current 'Halford' catalog so his current releases sound similar in production. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I think 'War of Words' was awesome the way it was & didn't need to be fixed in any way! If anything Halford should definitely remaster/remix Fight's only other full length CD 'Small Deadly Space.' All in all I think Fight fans should be satisfied; afterall it's better to see some footage of a great band on DVD than nothing at all!",4,Pretty cool DVD for Fight fans!,1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,1904,"['First', 'foremost', 'am', 'HUGE', 'Rob', 'Halford', 'fan', 'work', 'Priest', 'Halford', 'Fight', 'been', 'awesome', 'Fight/Halford', 'HEAVY/AGGRESSIVE', 'music', 'Priest', 'more', 'melodic/upbeat', 'metal', 'side', 'Fight', 'specifically', 'many', 'other', 'fans', 'really', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'CDs', 'band', 'was', 'Rob', 'Halford', 'most', 'crushing', 'material', 'career', 'truly', 'showed', 'how', 'was', 'determined', 'carry', 'metal', 'heavier', 'direction', 'going', 'too', 'extreme', 'satisfy', 'fans', 'walks', 'genre', 'Now', 'here', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'Fight', 'been', 'resurrected', 'new', 'DVD/CD', ""'War"", 'Words', 'footage', 'band', 'beginnings', 'everywhere', 'Halford', 'discussing', 'band', 'getting', 'together', 'showing', 'rehearsal', 'footage', 'showing', 'band', 'playing', 'stage', 'live', ""n't"", 'very', 'long', 'still', 'satisfying', 'see', 'how', 'Fight', 'saga', 'began', 'Next', 'concert', 'Fight', 'first', 'full', 'length', 'album', ""'War"", 'Words', 'Yes', 'made', 'footage', 'various', 'shows', 'made', 'look', 'one', 'show', 'opinion', 'think', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'considering', 'how', 'much', 'footage', 'had', 'be', 'worked', 'was', ""n't"", 'all', 'high', 'quality', 'audio', 'taken', '1', 'show', 'even', 'not', 'case', 'still', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good', 'only', 'so', 'part', 'package', ""'War"", 'Words', 'remastered/remixed', 'CD', 'think', 'Halford', 'cleaned', 'up', 'disc', 'sound', 'more', 'current', ""'Halford"", 'catalog', 'current', 'releases', 'sound', 'similar', 'production', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'think', ""'War"", 'Words', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'fixed', 'way', 'anything', 'Halford', 'should', 'definitely', 'remaster/remix', 'Fight', 'only', 'other', 'full', 'length', 'CD', 'Deadly', 'Space', 'think', 'Fight', 'fans', 'should', 'be', 'satisfied', 'afterall', 'better', 'see', 'footage', 'great', 'band', 'DVD', 'nothing']",N/A

1112367,AOZERN8GICKDD,B000WW1YPG,ERK,"[10, 14]","Being a huge Fight fan since back when War of Words first came out, I was really looking forward to this DVD/CD boxset.  Wow, a documentary, a complete live show, bonus footage, music videos, and the complete War of Words album remastered and remixed!  Sounds like a dream-come-true for any Fight fan, right?  Unfortunately...wrong.First you have the documentary.  It's semi-informative, but really isn't quite as interesting as I would have hoped.  A lot of it is old footage of Halford talking about the band, and some old footage of the band in rehearsals.  All of it looks very dated, with none of the footage cleaned up.Next we come to the live show.  Another letdown!  First of all, the footage looks like you're watching a cheap bootleg.  Secondly, the footage is a mix of a few different shows all under one live audio track so it's pretty disappointing.  You'll see Halford singing with a cap on, then a second later it's gone, etc.  The sound quality is only average as best as well.There are also some bonus live footage, which is mostly average stuff, and some music videos which are just terrible.  I can't believe how cheap they look, and how poorly done they are.  Halford's ""acting"" is pitiful too.  It's nice they were included, but they haven't stood the test of time at all.Lastly you have the remixed/remastered War of Words album.  To be honest this I was looking forward to the most.  It's a classic album, and I thought that an sound-update would really help make it even better.  Boy was I wrong.  Somehow they've managed to suck all the life and power out of all the songs and you're left with something that pales in comparison to the original mix.  Halford's vocals are too up-front now, the bass has been brought up but at the cost to drowning out the hi-hat and cymbals, the drums have a flat nu-metalish sound to them now, and the guitars don't have the power they used to in the original mix.  Not only that, but some of the songs have been changed, and mostly for the worse.  For instance, the keyboards in ""For All Eternity"" have been completely taken out.  Why I'm not sure, because I thought they really added to the atmosphere of the song.I'd say if you're a huge fan of the band, or Rob Halford in general, I can slightly recommend this because some may like the new mix of War of Words, and if you don't have real high expectations like I did, you may enjoy the cut-and-pasted live show and documentary.  I personally just didn't think any of it was all that special, and hoped it would have been a lot more entertaining.  Oh well, at least the artwork/layout is well done, and the K5 War of Words Demo CD they also just released is worth picking up.",2,Really lacking in quality...,1197849600,"12 17, 2007",2007,2688,"['Being', 'huge', 'Fight', 'fan', 'back', 'when', 'War', 'Words', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'DVD/CD', 'boxset', 'Wow', 'documentary', 'complete', 'live', 'show', 'bonus', 'footage', 'music', 'videos', 'complete', 'War', 'Words', 'album', 'remastered', 'remixed', 'dream-come-true', 'Fight', 'fan', 'right', 'Unfortunately', 'wrong.First', 'have', 'documentary', 'semi-informative', 'really', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'interesting', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', 'lot', 'old', 'footage', 'Halford', 'talking', 'band', 'old', 'footage', 'band', 'rehearsals', 'very', 'dated', 'none', 'footage', 'cleaned', 'come', 'live', 'show', 'letdown', 'First', 'all', 'footage', ""'re"", 'watching', 'cheap', 'bootleg', 'Secondly', 'footage', 'mix', 'few', 'different', 'shows', 'one', 'live', 'audio', 'track', 'pretty', 'disappointing', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Halford', 'singing', 'cap', 'then', 'second', 'later', 'gone', 'etc', 'sound', 'quality', 'only', 'average', 'as', 'best', 'well.There', 'are', 'also', 'bonus', 'live', 'footage', 'mostly', 'average', 'stuff', 'music', 'videos', 'are', 'just', 'terrible', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'cheap', 'look', 'how', 'poorly', 'done', 'are', 'Halford', 'acting', 'pitiful', 'too', 'nice', 'were', 'included', 'have', ""n't"", 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'all.Lastly', 'have', 'remixed/remastered', 'War', 'Words', 'album', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'most', 'classic', 'album', 'thought', 'sound-update', 'would', 'really', 'help', 'make', 'even', 'better', 'Boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'Somehow', ""'ve"", 'managed', 'suck', 'life', 'power', 'songs', ""'re"", 'left', 'something', 'comparison', 'original', 'mix', 'Halford', 'vocals', 'are', 'too', 'up-front', 'now', 'bass', 'been', 'brought', 'up', 'cost', 'drowning', 'out', 'hi-hat', 'cymbals', 'drums', 'have', 'flat', 'nu-metalish', 'sound', 'now', 'guitars', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'power', 'used', 'original', 'mix', 'Not', 'only', 'songs', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'mostly', 'worse', 'instance', 'keyboards', 'Eternity', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'taken', 'out', 'Why', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'thought', 'really', 'added', 'atmosphere', 'song.I', ""'d"", 'say', ""'re"", 'huge', 'fan', 'band', 'Rob', 'Halford', 'general', 'can', 'slightly', 'recommend', 'may', 'like', 'new', 'mix', 'War', 'Words', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'high', 'expectations', 'did', 'may', 'enjoy', 'cut-and-pasted', 'live', 'show', 'documentary', 'personally', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'special', 'hoped', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Oh', 'well', 'least', 'artwork/layout', 'well', 'done', 'K5', 'War', 'Words', 'Demo', 'CD', 'also', 'just', 'released', 'worth', 'picking', 'up']",N/A

You get the DVD, which has a short documentary from the Fight 1992 - 1993 (so it's not new).  The concert, which takes about 6 / 7 different shows but only uses 1 audio source. I am not sure why the one reviewer gave it 1 star, but to me the show was awesome and the band was in sync with the music / vocals. Also included are the War of Words promo videos, which there are 3 include Nailed to the Gun and Litte Crazy. ALso is a short live video clip from the Mutations tour, which is amazing performances of Into the Pit, Nailed to the Gun, and Freewheel Burning (Priest cover). Rounding out this DVD is a trailer from the 2008 Halford Live in Rio DVD.  Also included is the Fight War of Words CD remixed and remastered. Not much of a difference on the remix, but the remaster is superb.

1112369,A114DF0CBMTR9L,B000WW1YPG,"The Internet Vigilante ""It's easy. Just close...","[0, 0]","""Fight-Word of Words: The Film"" was something I thought I would get more of. The documentary movie, while interesting, was certainly not as in-depth or informative, nor as personal, as I had hoped for. C'mon, I wanted to see the bandmates just sittin' around, shootin' the breeze or writing the music, or Rob Halford discussing more thoroughly Fight's origins and creation.On the other hand, this little set is worth getting alone for ""War of Words Remixed and Remastered"". It blows the original version of the album off the planet! The songs sound better than they ever could have! Some notable examples: Into the Pit is righteous! On the older version, Halford's voice was rather inaudible and muffled, but on here he sings loud, proud and clear like the metal god he is; the instruments have also been more fine-tuned and overall a bit louder. A fade-out has been added to the end of the song as well, eliminating the too-jarring and over-fast lead-in to Nailed to the Gun on the OG version. Speaking of ""Nailed"", this track gives Halford grander, clearer vocals, though not quick as needed as Into the Pit, as well as a very slightly slower tempo, allowing for a wee-bit longer song.Overall, I'm kinda disappointed by the documentary, but on the other hand the bonus CD was more than worth it.
