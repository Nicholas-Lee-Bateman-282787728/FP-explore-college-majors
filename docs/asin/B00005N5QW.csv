666535,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B00005N5QW,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[0, 0]","Replicant is probably the most complete Van Damme movie made.  It has everything from an enjoyable and well paced plot, solid characters with pretty good acting, and wonderful action scenes.This is not the first movie to have 2 Van Damme main characters.  Double Impact was actually the first, but unlike that film, the two in Replicant are actually much more different and are pretty much enemies for the most part.  The first Van Damme character we are introudced to is the villain, and Van Damme actually does a really good job fullfilling this role.  The villain is not your typical bad guy - this guy is just dirty and has issues.  He is obsessed with not only killing, but burning all the ""bad"" mothers he comes in contact with, in return for his own mistreated youth.  It seems like nothing can stop this guy in the film, and he rarely gives a care about who gets in the way.  He has no trouble killing others and putting plenty in harms way.The other Van Damme character is a clone created in a government program, that hopes clones can successfully sense their real life counterparts, and lead the cops to the villain.  At first, the clone goes through some training and has a difficult time adjusting to life, but eventually learns.  He finally comes in contact with his villain counterpart, in a series of either rough fights or attempts to join sides with his real life self.The other notable character in the film is Jake (Michael Rooker) who has been hunting down the suspect for a long time, and with still no success, decides to retire.  The villain still wants him dead, and thats when Jake is asked to work with the clone in the new program to help find the murderer once and for all.  There are definetly some emotional moments between himself and the clone - moments of frustration, humor, carelessness, and eventually some bonding.As for action, the scenes are well placed throughout the plot of the movie.  All the action never dissapoints, and the fights are very hardcore - from bodies flying, to objects breaking in every scene, each fight is a brutal one.  The finale of the movie has the greatest action of all, and mainly involves an intense ambulance driving scene in a parking garage, where Jake is trying to stop the murderer from escaping.  There is also plenty of fight action too.This is one of Van Damme's better movies, and best performances, playing two very different roles well.  The movie works well altogther, and is enjoyable in more areas that just the action department.  Perhaps one of the last of the great Van Damme movies made is this one.  You won't be dissapointed.",4,my favorite of the more recenet van damme films,1184976000,"07 21, 2007",2007,2615,"['Replicant', 'probably', 'most', 'complete', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movie', 'made', 'everything', 'enjoyable', 'well', 'paced', 'plot', 'solid', 'characters', 'pretty', 'good', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'action', 'scenes.This', 'not', 'first', 'movie', 'have', '2', 'Van', 'Damme', 'main', 'characters', 'Double', 'Impact', 'was', 'actually', 'first', 'film', 'two', 'Replicant', 'are', 'actually', 'much', 'more', 'different', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'enemies', 'most', 'part', 'first', 'Van', 'Damme', 'character', 'are', 'introudced', 'villain', 'Van', 'Damme', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'fullfilling', 'role', 'villain', 'not', 'typical', 'bad', 'guy', 'guy', 'just', 'dirty', 'issues', 'obsessed', 'not', 'only', 'killing', 'burning', 'bad', 'mothers', 'contact', 'return', 'own', 'mistreated', 'youth', 'nothing', 'can', 'stop', 'guy', 'film', 'rarely', 'care', 'who', 'way', 'trouble', 'killing', 'others', 'putting', 'plenty', 'harms', 'way.The', 'other', 'Van', 'Damme', 'character', 'clone', 'created', 'government', 'program', 'clones', 'can', 'successfully', 'sense', 'real', 'life', 'counterparts', 'lead', 'cops', 'villain', 'first', 'clone', 'training', 'difficult', 'time', 'adjusting', 'life', 'eventually', 'finally', 'contact', 'villain', 'counterpart', 'series', 'rough', 'fights', 'attempts', 'join', 'sides', 'real', 'life', 'self.The', 'other', 'notable', 'character', 'film', 'Jake', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'who', 'been', 'hunting', 'down', 'suspect', 'long', 'time', 'still', 'success', 'retire', 'villain', 'still', 'dead', 'thats', 'when', 'Jake', 'asked', 'work', 'clone', 'new', 'program', 'help', 'find', 'murderer', 'once', 'are', 'definetly', 'emotional', 'moments', 'clone', 'moments', 'frustration', 'humor', 'carelessness', 'eventually', 'bonding.As', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'placed', 'plot', 'movie', 'action', 'never', 'dissapoints', 'fights', 'are', 'very', 'hardcore', 'bodies', 'flying', 'objects', 'breaking', 'scene', 'fight', 'brutal', 'one', 'finale', 'movie', 'greatest', 'action', 'mainly', 'intense', 'ambulance', 'driving', 'scene', 'parking', 'garage', 'where', 'Jake', 'trying', 'stop', 'murderer', 'escaping', 'also', 'plenty', 'fight', 'action', 'too.This', 'one', 'Van', 'Damme', 'better', 'movies', 'best', 'performances', 'playing', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'roles', 'well', 'movie', 'well', 'altogther', 'enjoyable', 'more', 'areas', 'just', 'action', 'department', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'last', 'great', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movies', 'made', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissapointed']",N/A
666536,A341E0Q1O5GH4H,B00005N5QW,Dragon,"[0, 0]","Replicant is a movie where a mask murderer goes on crime sprees killing innocent women. Not only that, this sick murderer (Jean-Claude) actually takes pictures of these sick crimes. That's where Jake comes in (Michael Rooker), Jake is a undercover cop who has been chasing Garrett (the murderer) for 3 years, after one particular night he calls it quits and retires from the force at a early age. After he starts getting on with his life he gets an insulting call from Garrett and is given the opportunity by the CIA to help them bring down the murderer. He accepts and heads down the there headquarters. He finds out that they aren't actually the CIA, their Special Forces Unit and they have a DNA sample of the killer and they will use that to create a Replicant (clone) of the murderer. After many tests they are finally able to put the Replicant out of hibernation and into the real world.The Replicant is suppose to have the brain capabilities of a 40 year old (the murderers approximate age) and if given enough time, it could remember how exactly the murderer went about the killings, how he escaped, who he is, and where he lives, and that's what they want to get out of him. But the Replicant is like a baby, he needs to learn how to eat sleep, walk, talk, everything. That's where Jake comes in again, Jake is basically suppose to baby sit the Replicant until he can remember the crimes. The Replicant grows to care for and accept Jake, while he doesn't trust anyone else.During the movie we find out more about the murderer and kind of get an inside scoop of how this murderer lives and why he's doing all these killings. I'm not going to spoil it for you but let me tell you, this guy is a sick puppy, anyone who has watched Van Damme movies in the past will be shocked at the role he's playing now. The Replicant meets up with the murderer a few times and each time the Replicant starts to bond with the murderer, since he can think how the murderer thinks, and given enough time, he could read the murderers mind completely. At first the murderer doesn't know who the Replicant is but then he eventually finds out.The Replicant is not like many creatures, it copies what people do and say, in one part of the movie where they try to apprehend the Replicant they end up losing, why? Because anything you show him he learns, if you punch him he learns the exact punch you did, if you put him in a head lock he learns that exact head lock, and that's what he used to defeat them. I'm still not going to spoil all the movie but Jake and the Replicant track the murderer down many times, and each time the murderer tricks the Replicant into thinking that their brothers and that Jake is the enemy, The Replicant starts to show his true color by allowing the murderer to escape and apprehending Jake at that. But then the Replicant learns the murderers true colors and turns on the him and that's what allows Jake and The Replicant to defeat this sick murderer.The movie had a tight budget but it doesn't show it at all.

I also never thought I'd see the day that Van Damme would perform as a ""real"" actor.  Well, folks.  This is the day, and this is the film.  While this may only be a fluke (like Segal's UNDER SEIGE), one can always hope.Granted, the storyline isn't much to talk about (what is it that makes Van Damme want to play two rolls?), and the premise itself is absolutely unbelievable ... still, it is not without interest, but one must keep eyes tightly closed to a few plot holes and contrivances.  But believe it or not, what helped make this film interesting was Van Damme's performance (that and Ringo Lam's fast, hard-hitting direction -- he also directed Van Damme's MAXIMUM RISK).If you're not much of a Van Damme fan, I doubt this film will change your mind.

666539,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00005N5QW,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","In Hollywood parlance this is a ""high concept"" movie. Any one of the major studios, had they given this the green light, would have thrown tons o' bucks at it and hired the best at all levels. Unfortunately, that didn't happen here and it's frustrating to watch as a result.It pretty much starts with a lacking script. Michael Rooker, on the eve of his retirement as a police detective, just misses his chance to nab serial killer Van Damme. He retires but is wooed back into the game by the FBI who has a program whereby they have cloned the serial killer (through a strand of hair) in the hopes he will think like the original and lead them to the killer. This is a test to see if they can pull the same thing off with terrorists.This is a tough nut to crack story-wise and this writing just didn't do enough to make me believe the situation. Then you have the replicant Van Damme who is fully adult but doesn't even have the skills of a child. Now we need to watch his development. Again, the writing wasn't skilled enough to pull it off. Then there's the relationship he needs to develop with Rooker who can only see him as a serial killer and not as an innocent who can develop into a good person. This is all very clunky and misses the mark. Then, of course, the two Van Dammes need to meet and the final murder thwarted. Clunk, clunk, clunk.Ringo lam is a fine director, and his work with Van Damme in ""Maximum Risk"" was very good, but here he struggles with this lousy script and there's no way out. If you can get past the ridiculous premise then you still need to tackle the other issues which well could have been done.The production values are good enough and Van Damme does a surprisingly good job playing the two roles, but at every turn, I saw what could have been done but wasn't and it just made me want to spit.

On the other hand, watching him perfect his 'Rain Man' side added a touch of pathos and humour as well--I think this movie represents his best acting yet, and believe me, that is saying a lot.Some of the deleted scenes should have been left in for further character development, but overall, it's a tight, well-paced thriller/action film that really deserved a theatre release.

666543,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00005N5QW,Jason,"[4, 5]","The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix (JCVD-RM)1.  Who is he? Edward Garrotte, murder victims he burns.  Nicknamed is ""The Torch"", his alias well earned.  His hair has been used, for the DNA.  A Replicant is made, to save the day.2.  Which family member/friend must be avenged?  His mother?  Himself?  This part is hazy.  Suffice to say, the setup is crazy.3.  Does he take his shirt off?  When born as ""Replicant"", it's all for show.  Think Keanu, Matrix, without the ""Whoa"".4.  Does he have sex with a C-List actress?  He meets a hooker, alone on the street.  In less than one second, it's ugh, skeet skeet.5.  Is there a tournament?  Replicant has no tournament at all.  Following the matrix, it's the sole fault.6.  Is training needed for this tournament?  Training is always essential to plot.  Gymnastics, however?  Probably not.7.  Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament?  When learning to use a body brand new, it's: crawl, walk, run, and practice the splits, too.8.  Does he punch someone in the balls?  With JCVD, balls should always be scared.  Two Van Dammes, two roles, balls better beware.  Samaritan not to swift on his feet? Gerrotte takes umbrage, and his heel meets meat.  The police decide to pull out a Glock?  Gerrotte fights back, and he hammers a c#@*.9.  Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? Hey kitchen employees!  What do you see?  Roundhouse for each - 1800 degrees.  When two Van Dammes meet, one can feel mana.  This is, quite simply, roundhouse nirvana.10.  Is his enemy unbeatable?  Never before has Van Damme faced this threat, even in Bloodsport when he faced Bolo.  It's his exact clone, not a silhouette; it's truly his first unbeatable foe.11.  Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance?  With two JCVDs, there are two problems.  The Replicant seems slightly retarded.  Garrotte, however, has some great drama.  He burns because his childhood trauma.12.  Does he win?  It's the same as all; the end's transparent.  But you'll love this movie, it's a sure bet.With Replicant JCVD brings back the double entendre title (Knock Off), as well as the dual role responsibility from a previous movie (Double Impact).  One has to admire a guy who shamelessly makes the same movie throughout his career without acquiescing to an increasingly resistant fan-base.  When that same guy makes a movie with a tongue-in-cheek title about his career's repetitiousness, then even more credit is deserved.  When that same actor does it again within a three year span, make way, because he's clearly dragging his massive cojones a foot behind him.  The production values, cast, action (especially a thrilling ambulance scene), and fights are great, making this not only an impressive return to JCVD's roots, but also proof of his growth as an actor (very convincing as the Replicant).All things considered, I felt that this review required special attention - my tribute to quintessential JCVD.",4,A return to JCVD's roots - Roundhouse Nirvana,1223683200,"10 11, 2008",2008,2938,"['Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Review', 'Matrix', 'JCVD-RM', '1.', 'Who', 'Edward', 'Garrotte', 'murder', 'victims', 'Nicknamed', 'Torch', 'alias', 'well', 'earned', 'hair', 'been', 'used', 'DNA', 'Replicant', 'made', 'save', 'day.2', 'Which', 'family', 'member/friend', 'must', 'be', 'avenged', 'mother', 'part', 'hazy', 'Suffice', 'say', 'setup', 'crazy.3', 'take', 'shirt', 'off', 'When', 'born', 'Replicant', 'show', 'Think', 'Keanu', 'Matrix', 'Whoa', '.4', 'have', 'sex', 'C-List', 'actress', 'hooker', 'alone', 'street', 'less', 'one', 'second', 'ugh', 'skeet', 'skeet.5', 'there', 'tournament', 'Replicant', 'tournament', 'Following', 'matrix', 'sole', 'fault.6', 'training', 'needed', 'tournament', 'Training', 'always', 'essential', 'plot', 'Gymnastics', 'however', 'Probably', 'not.7', 'do', 'splits', 'training', 'tournament', 'When', 'learning', 'use', 'body', 'brand', 'new', 'crawl', 'walk', 'run', 'practice', 'splits', 'too.8', 'punch', 'someone', 'balls', 'JCVD', 'balls', 'should', 'always', 'be', 'scared', 'Two', 'Van', 'Dammes', 'two', 'roles', 'balls', 'better', 'beware', 'Samaritan', 'not', 'swift', 'feet', 'Gerrotte', 'umbrage', 'heel', 'meets', 'meat', 'police', 'decide', 'pull', 'out', 'Glock', 'Gerrotte', 'back', 'c', '@', '*.9', 'do', 'series', 'flying', '360', 'kicks', 'Hey', 'kitchen', 'employees', 'What', 'do', 'see', 'Roundhouse', '1800', 'degrees', 'When', 'two', 'Van', 'Dammes', 'meet', 'one', 'can', 'feel', 'mana', 'quite', 'simply', 'roundhouse', 'nirvana.10', 'enemy', 'unbeatable', 'Never', 'Van', 'Damme', 'faced', 'threat', 'even', 'Bloodsport', 'when', 'faced', 'Bolo', 'exact', 'clone', 'not', 'silhouette', 'truly', 'first', 'unbeatable', 'foe.11', 'overcome', 'injury', 'other', 'hindrance', 'two', 'JCVDs', 'are', 'two', 'problems', 'Replicant', 'slightly', 'retarded', 'Garrotte', 'however', 'great', 'drama', 'childhood', 'trauma.12', 'win', 'same', 'end', 'transparent', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie', 'sure', 'bet.With', 'Replicant', 'JCVD', 'back', 'double', 'entendre', 'title', 'Knock', 'Off', 'as', 'well', 'dual', 'role', 'responsibility', 'previous', 'movie', 'Double', 'Impact', 'One', 'admire', 'guy', 'who', 'shamelessly', 'same', 'movie', 'career', 'acquiescing', 'increasingly', 'resistant', 'fan-base', 'When', 'same', 'guy', 'movie', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'title', 'career', 'repetitiousness', 'then', 'even', 'more', 'credit', 'deserved', 'When', 'same', 'actor', 'again', 'three', 'year', 'span', 'make', 'way', 'clearly', 'dragging', 'massive', 'cojones', 'foot', 'production', 'values', 'cast', 'action', 'especially', 'thrilling', 'ambulance', 'scene', 'fights', 'are', 'great', 'making', 'not', 'only', 'impressive', 'return', 'JCVD', 'roots', 'also', 'proof', 'growth', 'actor', 'very', 'convincing', 'Replicant', '.All', 'things', 'considered', 'felt', 'review', 'required', 'special', 'attention', 'tribute', 'quintessential', 'JCVD']",N/A

Paul ""John doe""","[1, 1]",Replicant made in 2001 released straight to DVD directed by Ringo Lam he directed a great drama called In Hell that also starred Van Damme. It stars Jean Claude Van Damme as Garrotte he also plays a clone of himself.  Michael Rooker as Jake Riley. Story is Seattle Washington cop Jake Riley has been after a serial killer named Torch he targets young single mothers. Jake thinks he has him 1 night but he gets away & unfortunately this was his last night on the force the FBI offer Jake a job he declines but when Garrotte The Torch Killer continues with threatening phone calls he accepts. The Defense Department have cloned The Torch Killer but he's the opposite. They also have a telepathic bond The Clone has visions of Garrotte's murders & it gets them closer to stopping him. Van Damme did a good job as the villain his performance here reinforces why I though he should've been the bad Terminator in T3. Michael Rooker was great. It was a return to form for Van Damme after doing a few flops in the mid to late 90's. Martial arts was decent also the fight between Garrotte & The Clone was interesting.

A just-retired cop, Jake, cannot rest as a serial killer targets mothers and savagely murders them.  Grim scenes, here.  Jake gets a chance to test a secret NSA science project, a replicant of the killer, to see if it will work to catch the killer.  If it works, they would clone terrorists and such to track them.

But since the DVD is here, Van Damme's fans (and action fans) should check it out. It is far better than his last 4 or 5 films (which are very bad: Desert heat, Universal soldiers: The return, Double Team, Knock off).The story about cloning but director Ringo Lam made this movie highly entertaining. Van Damme plays double role, one is  the serial killer, the other role as his clone which created so the police can catch the serial killer.

Jean Claude van Damme gives one of his most convincing performances in two roles:  a slimy serial killer called the Torch who has been murdering mothers and their babies, and as his genetic double, a kind of childlike replicant.  The clone was done in order to try and retrace the movements of the real Torch, but also as a governmental experiment to initiate further plans for the future.  Van Damme is repulsive as the Torch and quite convincing as the new Torch, who is put under the care of former cop, now secret service agent Michael Rooker.  Rooker gives a compelling performance and the relationship that develops between he and the genetic double is well developed.

666557,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005N5QW,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 3]","You've got to give Jean-Claude Van Damme credit. Aging action heroes don't have a lot of choices, but Van Damme isn't afraid to put a different spin on the tired trope of playing two different characters in the same film (see Total Recall, Time Cop, The One, etc.). The two roles are distinctly different, down to their martial arts styles.  Edward ""The Torch"" Garrotte (Van Damme) is a brutal Special Forces soldier with mommy issues who murders bad mothers and set their corpses on fire.  The replicant (Van Damme) is a clone of the serial killer with ""genetic memory"" who is a bit of a simpleton.  Bad Van Damme uses brutal kicks and slams; good Van Damme grapples and performs gymnastics.About that title: Replicant is predicated on the belief that a clone has ""racial memory"" of the original. Instead of using good ole' police work to find the serial killer, a secret government agency clones him, and then entrusts him into the care of retired cop Jake Riley (Michael Rooker).  It just so happens this retired cop was the archnemesis of the serial killer but had given up the detective life in exchange for a boat. That's when the government spooks scoop him up and put him in charge of their replicant.Things don't go well at first. The Riley, who isn't a very compassionate man, treats the replicant no better than a dog, heaping verbal and physical abuse on him. When the replicant escapes, he is seduced by prostitutes, assaulted by pimps, and nearly dies in the street.  It takes a certain level of dedication from an actor for him to lose control of himself on a shapely prostitute's leg and then walk around with a wet spot on his pants. Clearly, Van Damme took this role with nothing to lose.The pathetic nature of the replicant is made up for by the surprisingly nuanced Garrotte, who still visits his terrifying mother in the hospital. Garrotte is a dead-eyed, brutal killer that quite likes the idea of a brother.Although Riley goes through a predictable transformation from hard-nosed cop to father figure, the change is rife with clich&eacute;ds -- it involves buying ice cream in the park, a staple of all good fathers. There's also not a lot of martial arts action between the two versions; fans of Van Damme's traditional work will be disappointed.And yet you have to give Replicant props for trying.  It's not high drama, but it does provide some interesting twists on a tired genre in which every action star takes turns beating himself up.",3,Van Damme beats himself up,1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,2464,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'give', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'credit', 'Aging', 'action', 'heroes', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'choices', 'Van', 'Damme', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'put', 'different', 'spin', 'tired', 'trope', 'playing', 'two', 'different', 'characters', 'same', 'film', 'see', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Time', 'Cop', 'One', 'etc.', 'two', 'roles', 'are', 'distinctly', 'different', 'down', 'martial', 'arts', 'styles', 'Edward', 'Torch', 'Garrotte', 'Van', 'Damme', 'brutal', 'Special', 'Forces', 'soldier', 'mommy', 'issues', 'who', 'bad', 'mothers', 'set', 'corpses', 'fire', 'replicant', 'Van', 'Damme', 'clone', 'serial', 'killer', 'genetic', 'memory', 'who', 'bit', 'simpleton', 'Bad', 'Van', 'Damme', 'brutal', 'kicks', 'slams', 'good', 'Van', 'Damme', 'grapples', 'performs', 'gymnastics.About', 'title', 'Replicant', 'predicated', 'belief', 'clone', 'racial', 'memory', 'original', 'Instead', 'using', 'good', 'ole', 'police', 'work', 'find', 'serial', 'killer', 'secret', 'government', 'agency', 'clones', 'then', 'care', 'retired', 'cop', 'Jake', 'Riley', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'just', 'so', 'retired', 'cop', 'was', 'archnemesis', 'serial', 'killer', 'had', 'given', 'up', 'detective', 'life', 'exchange', 'boat', 'when', 'government', 'spooks', 'scoop', 'up', 'put', 'charge', 'replicant.Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'first', 'Riley', 'who', ""n't"", 'very', 'compassionate', 'man', 'replicant', 'better', 'dog', 'heaping', 'verbal', 'physical', 'abuse', 'When', 'replicant', 'seduced', 'prostitutes', 'assaulted', 'pimps', 'nearly', 'dies', 'street', 'certain', 'level', 'dedication', 'actor', 'lose', 'control', 'shapely', 'prostitute', 'leg', 'then', 'walk', 'wet', 'spot', 'pants', 'Clearly', 'Van', 'Damme', 'took', 'role', 'nothing', 'lose.The', 'pathetic', 'nature', 'replicant', 'made', 'up', 'surprisingly', 'nuanced', 'Garrotte', 'who', 'still', 'terrifying', 'mother', 'hospital', 'Garrotte', 'dead-eyed', 'brutal', 'killer', 'quite', 'idea', 'brother.Although', 'Riley', 'predictable', 'transformation', 'hard-nosed', 'cop', 'father', 'figure', 'change', 'rife', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ds', 'buying', 'ice', 'cream', 'park', 'staple', 'good', 'fathers', 'also', 'not', 'lot', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'two', 'versions', 'fans', 'Van', 'Damme', 'traditional', 'work', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed.And', 'yet', 'have', 'give', 'Replicant', 'props', 'trying', 'not', 'high', 'drama', 'provide', 'interesting', 'twists', 'tired', 'genre', 'action', 'star', 'beating', 'up']",N/A

666560,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00005N5QW,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","For better or worse, Jean-Claude Van Damme holds an amount of recognition as ""the guy who plays twins a lot.""Double Impactwas cool andMaximum Riskwas a step out of the ordinary for the Muscles from Brussels, but I dare say that Van Damme's second outing with director Ringo Lam takes the cake as the best instance of the European karate expert playing two lookalikes. It's definitely one of the man's better outings of his DTV career, and definitely one of the strangest of all of his films, but it's strange in an entertaining sort of way, to the point that I'd advise all Van Damme fans to give it a buy if they can live without the usual abundance of martial arts.The story: detective Jake Riley (Michael Rooker,Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer) ends his career unable to tie up the case of a mother-murdering serial killer (Van Damme). With murderer refusing to cease his killing spree, Jake engages in a national security project to clone the criminal and use the genetic memory inherited by his ""replicant"" to track down the real murderer.A point of interest: prior toJCVD, this is the only film for which Van Damme was nominated for a legitimate acting prize - the DVD Exclusive Award for ""Best Actor."" He didn't win, but nevertheless, it was nice to see some recognition for his efforts to become more than an action star. That being said, I think that only half of his performance deserves the nomination: as the replicant, Van Damme's relies almost entirely on physical expression and body language and therein pulls off one of the better performances of his career as a nave, newborn human, while his take on the killer is much less interesting than even his previous roles as bad guys. Other than him, the film doesn't have a very large starring cast but those involved generally do a good job. Michael Rooker is a vastly underrated actor who gives a very entertaining performance but has a bad habit of going off the cartoony end when he starts shouting. Catherine Dent (The Shield) co-stars as Riley's ex-partner, and while she doesn't have a lot of screentime, she makes good use of it. Marnie Alton would later be promoted to the role of Van Damme's wife inIn Hell, but here she plays a prostitute whom the replicant takes a liking to. Her scene is probably the most awkward one in the film, but she makes it work even when Van Damme is literally humping her leg.There is significantly less action in ""Replicant"" than there is in, say,Sudden Death, but if you're willing to wait for it, what's there is not bad at all. Martial arts are kept to a minimum, with the killer only throwing out a handful of kicks as he pursues his victims. The replicant steals the show: though he imitates his evil self to land a few roundhouse kicks in the film's finale, he utilizes gymnastics to great effect in four fun, acrobatic fight scenes. These parts are obviously filmed using a double, but it's close enough that you don't notice the exchange; the same goes for the scenes in which the replicant confronts his original self. In addition, there are some reasonably neat automobile stunts involving Michael Rooker getting hit by a car and one wherein a runaway ambulance ends up upside-down in a stairwell.Rooker's character comes off a bit unlikeable when he's callously unable to differentiate between the killer and the sympathetic replicant, and there's a bit of weird scene where he figures the only way he can locate a tracking device on the latter is to strip him down to his underwear and feel him up while his mother (the character's) watches. Other than that, it's a thoroughly high-end DTV film with an interesting story and great production values that take next to no sloppy shortcuts. Even non-Van Damme fans looking for an out-of-the-ordinary thriller wouldn't be ill-advised in checking this one out. Bit by bit, Van Damme is making himself more accessible to non-action fans, and this was a big step in the right direction.",4,None Other Like It; A Very Good Van Damme Flick,1244332800,"06 7, 2009",2009,3947,"['better', 'worse', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'amount', 'recognition', 'guy', 'who', 'lot', 'Double', 'Impactwas', 'cool', 'andMaximum', 'Riskwas', 'step', 'ordinary', 'Muscles', 'Brussels', 'dare', 'say', 'Van', 'Damme', 'second', 'outing', 'director', 'Ringo', 'Lam', 'cake', 'best', 'instance', 'European', 'karate', 'expert', 'playing', 'two', 'lookalikes', 'definitely', 'one', 'man', 'better', 'outings', 'DTV', 'career', 'definitely', 'one', 'strangest', 'films', 'strange', 'entertaining', 'sort', 'way', 'point', ""'d"", 'advise', 'Van', 'Damme', 'fans', 'give', 'buy', 'can', 'live', 'usual', 'abundance', 'martial', 'arts.The', 'story', 'detective', 'Jake', 'Riley', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'Henry', 'Portrait', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'career', 'unable', 'tie', 'up', 'case', 'mother-murdering', 'serial', 'killer', 'Van', 'Damme', 'murderer', 'refusing', 'cease', 'killing', 'spree', 'Jake', 'national', 'security', 'project', 'clone', 'criminal', 'use', 'genetic', 'memory', 'inherited', 'replicant', 'track', 'down', 'real', 'murderer.A', 'point', 'interest', 'prior', 'toJCVD', 'only', 'film', 'Van', 'Damme', 'was', 'nominated', 'legitimate', 'acting', 'prize', 'DVD', 'Exclusive', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'nevertheless', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'recognition', 'efforts', 'become', 'more', 'action', 'star', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'only', 'half', 'performance', 'nomination', 'replicant', 'Van', 'Damme', 'relies', 'almost', 'entirely', 'physical', 'expression', 'body', 'language', 'therein', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'career', 'nave', 'newborn', 'human', 'take', 'killer', 'much', 'less', 'interesting', 'even', 'previous', 'roles', 'bad', 'guys', 'Other', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'large', 'starring', 'cast', 'involved', 'generally', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'vastly', 'underrated', 'actor', 'who', 'very', 'entertaining', 'performance', 'bad', 'habit', 'going', 'off', 'cartoony', 'end', 'when', 'shouting', 'Catherine', 'Dent', 'Shield', 'co-stars', 'Riley', 'ex-partner', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'screentime', 'good', 'use', 'Marnie', 'Alton', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'promoted', 'role', 'Van', 'Damme', 'wife', 'inIn', 'Hell', 'here', 'prostitute', 'whom', 'replicant', 'liking', 'scene', 'probably', 'most', 'awkward', 'one', 'film', 'work', 'even', 'when', 'Van', 'Damme', 'literally', 'humping', 'leg.There', 'significantly', 'less', 'action', 'Replicant', 'say', 'Sudden', 'Death', ""'re"", 'willing', 'wait', 'what', 'not', 'bad', 'Martial', 'arts', 'are', 'kept', 'minimum', 'killer', 'only', 'throwing', 'out', 'handful', 'kicks', 'victims', 'replicant', 'show', 'evil', 'self', 'land', 'few', 'roundhouse', 'kicks', 'film', 'finale', 'gymnastics', 'great', 'effect', 'four', 'fun', 'acrobatic', 'fight', 'scenes', 'parts', 'are', 'obviously', 'filmed', 'using', 'double', 'close', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'exchange', 'same', 'scenes', 'replicant', 'original', 'self', 'addition', 'are', 'reasonably', 'neat', 'automobile', 'stunts', 'involving', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'getting', 'hit', 'car', 'one', 'wherein', 'runaway', 'ambulance', 'up', 'upside-down', 'stairwell.Rooker', 'character', 'off', 'bit', 'unlikeable', 'when', 'callously', 'unable', 'differentiate', 'killer', 'sympathetic', 'replicant', 'bit', 'weird', 'scene', 'where', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'locate', 'tracking', 'device', 'latter', 'strip', 'down', 'underwear', 'feel', 'up', 'mother', 'character', 'watches', 'Other', 'thoroughly', 'high-end', 'DTV', 'film', 'interesting', 'story', 'great', 'production', 'values', 'take', 'next', 'sloppy', 'shortcuts', 'Even', 'non-Van', 'Damme', 'fans', 'looking', 'out-of-the-ordinary', 'thriller', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'ill-advised', 'checking', 'one', 'out', 'Bit', 'bit', 'Van', 'Damme', 'making', 'more', 'accessible', 'non-action', 'fans', 'was', 'big', 'step', 'right', 'direction']",N/A

I was waiting for &quot;Replicant&quot; to come to theaters, but it never showed up. So I looked around on the Internet to see if it was coming to DVD or video soon, and sure enough, there it was! When I saw it on my DVD player, I found out that it was a really great Van Damme film! &quot;Replicant&quot; centers around Van Damme as a serial killer being hunted down by Michael Rooker's character as a jaded cop who has spent months tracking the killer down, but somehow he got forced to retire. The National Security Force offers Rooker a chance to finally catch the killer once and for all. The solution: to create a replicated clone (also Van Damme) that will sense where the killer had been living, etc., and will try to stop him dead.

Pretty much the same story as 'The Watcher' where there is a killer in black with long hair that kills lonely women and stalks a police officer. But in 'Replicant', the killer is cloned. I am a Jean-Claude Van Damme fan and I have to say that this film ROCKS! Probably Van Damme's best. Replicant is a sci-fi thriller. Good story and its new and different. The word 'ORIGINAL' comes to mind. Jean-Claude Van Damme acts good as the killer and the clone. Van Damme's voice even sounds different as when he's the killer which shows good acting. The voice of the killer by VD is awesome and he really sounds like a bad guy. The replicant is dumb and acts like a kid in a 40-year old body. Very good acting by Michael Rooker who plays a bad [...] cop. Like most of Rooker's films, he has a temper.

666568,A2RN2AO4BE6F4K,B00005N5QW,"Scott Bright ""scottypotty""","[0, 0]","Movie Summary: Veteran detective Jake Riley has not been able to catch the serial killer known as &quot;The Torch&quot; who kills mothers and burns their bodies. Jake retires from the force but is sucked back into the case when he is offered another way to catch the killer. The government is seems can clone people and they have cloned The Torch in hopes that they can use the genetic double to track him down.My Opinion: My biggest problem with Replicant was that it could have been so good. It could have delved into the nature/nurture argument and made a statement. It could have developed a relationship between Jake and the replicant and showed that The Torch turned into a killer because of the way he was tortured as a child. Instead Jake turns out to be a morally bankrupt character with no back-story who can't grasp that the replicant is a human being until it's too late. They didn't show any reason for Jake's brutality towards the replicant. When his mother scolds him for treating the replicant badly, I was hopeful that things would change, but a blanket and an ice cream cone just don't cut it. Had Jake been mistreated as a child, or had his mother been murdered, then there could have been some common ground to build on. Instead he's just a black box to us. Now maybe this is all too much to expect from a Van Damme movie, but they had it all set up and came so close. I was impressed with Van Damme's acting in the film. He was genuinely convincing as the replicant. His facial expressions were really convincing. Rooker on the other hand just seemed to be angry the entire movie. Maybe he's still upset over Henry. I know I still am. The stunts and explosions were impressive too, especially for a direct to video movie.DVD Quality: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 with excellent video quality, Sound is DD5.1 This is a decent DVD release with extras including deleted scenes and commentary.What You Should Do: Most Van Damme fans will probably enjoy this one. The killing and burning of the female victims bodies is not for the squeamish so beware. If you are not a Van Damme fan, then you might as well skip this one.Related Movies To Check Out: Cyborg, Timecop, The Silence of the Lambs",2,Van Damme It All This Could Have Been Great!,1010102400,"01 4, 2002",2002,2208,"['Movie', 'Summary', 'Veteran', 'detective', 'Jake', 'Riley', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'catch', 'serial', 'killer', 'known', 'quot', 'Torch', 'quot', 'who', 'mothers', 'burns', 'bodies', 'Jake', 'force', 'sucked', 'back', 'case', 'when', 'offered', 'way', 'catch', 'killer', 'government', 'can', 'clone', 'people', 'have', 'cloned', 'Torch', 'hopes', 'can', 'use', 'genetic', 'double', 'track', 'down.My', 'Opinion', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Replicant', 'was', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'delved', 'nature/nurture', 'argument', 'made', 'statement', 'could', 'have', 'developed', 'relationship', 'Jake', 'replicant', 'showed', 'Torch', 'turned', 'killer', 'way', 'was', 'tortured', 'child', 'Instead', 'Jake', 'out', 'be', 'morally', 'bankrupt', 'character', 'back-story', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'grasp', 'replicant', 'human', 'being', 'too', 'late', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'reason', 'Jake', 'brutality', 'replicant', 'When', 'mother', 'treating', 'replicant', 'badly', 'was', 'hopeful', 'things', 'would', 'change', 'blanket', 'ice', 'cream', 'cone', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'cut', 'Had', 'Jake', 'been', 'mistreated', 'child', 'had', 'mother', 'been', 'murdered', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'common', 'ground', 'build', 'Instead', 'just', 'black', 'box', 'Now', 'maybe', 'too', 'much', 'expect', 'Van', 'Damme', 'movie', 'had', 'set', 'up', 'came', 'so', 'close', 'was', 'impressed', 'Van', 'Damme', 'acting', 'film', 'was', 'genuinely', 'convincing', 'replicant', 'facial', 'expressions', 'were', 'really', 'convincing', 'Rooker', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'angry', 'entire', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'still', 'upset', 'over', 'Henry', 'know', 'still', 'am', 'stunts', 'explosions', 'were', 'impressive', 'too', 'especially', 'direct', 'video', 'movie.DVD', 'Quality', 'Widescreen', 'Anamorphic', '1.85:1', 'excellent', 'video', 'quality', 'Sound', 'DD5.1', 'decent', 'DVD', 'release', 'extras', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary.What', 'Should', 'Do', 'Most', 'Van', 'Damme', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'one', 'killing', 'burning', 'female', 'victims', 'bodies', 'not', 'squeamish', 'so', 'beware', 'are', 'not', 'Van', 'Damme', 'fan', 'then', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'skip', 'one.Related', 'Movies', 'Check', 'Out', 'Cyborg', 'Timecop', 'Silence', 'Lambs']",N/A

The cops have been trying for like 3 years to find him with no luck. The main cop in the case retires from the force, and some government agency hires him to continue looking for the killer. Little does he know, they recovered a single hair from one of the crime scenes, and with that hair they basically made a clone of the killer. Their hope, is that the clone will be able to help them figure out who the killer is. And the clone is also played by, obviously, van damn. So, if you can by the whole cloning sci-fi stuff, and believe that, then the rest of the movie was actually very good. They don't dwell on or explain the cloning thing at all anyways. That whole thing is only a small part of the movie. So the ex-cop drags the clone all over town, trying to see if he can help him at all. The clone actually starts remembering things the killer did, and that helps the cops find the killer. There was quite a bit of fighting in it. It was nice to see he's still in great shape, unlike the other left over from the 80's, our old fat friend seagal. As a martial arts movie, not so good.

666573,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005N5QW,trebe,"[1, 1]","""Replicant"" offers a twist, on the standard cop chasing a killer story, attempting to use insight provided by the murderer's genetic clone, to track down the killer.  Jean-Claude Van Damme has dual roles as the serial killer, and also as his clone, ""Replicant"".  Michael Rooker is the ex-cop who comes out of ""retirement"" to attempt to train Replicant, and see if he can lead him to the killer.Traumatized as a child by his mother, Luc Sevard has become a serial murderer.  His victims are single mothers.  Nicknamed ""The Torch"", because he sets the dead bodies on fire, he has eluded the efforts of the Seattle police, headed by Detective Jake Riley (Rooker) for three years.  On Riley's last day on the force, the Torch claims his eleventh victim.No longer on the force, Riley is recruited by the National Security Force (NSF) to participate in a top-secret operation.  NSF has cloned Sevard's DNA and created Replicant (his name).  The plan is to train Replicant and then attempt to tap into his memory and somehow get a lead to the killer.  Riley takes charge of Replicant and begins his training, treating him like an animal, trying to trigger his memory.The dual roles play to Van Damme's strengths as an actor.  Replicant is childlike, has limited dialog, and communicates more by actions rather than words.  Sevard is also more of a man of action, with most of his interaction with others consisting of fights or attacks.  The fight scenes between the longhaired Sevard, and the close cropped clone, required extensive doubling, and are done pretty well.Riley is actually the movie's lead character, and is important as the focal point between the Yin and Yang of the Van Damme characters.  Put in a tough spot, he isn't sure how to handle Replicant, and so he must err on the side of caution, and treat him with a great deal of distrust.  Michael Rooker really throws himself into the physically challenging role.Replicant is a decent action movie.  Jean-Claude is not required to go beyond his limits, and does a good job with the material.  The aging action hero still has some good moves left, and believe it or not, his acting skills have improved some too.

666574,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005N5QW,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","When you watch those action flicks by such Hong-Kong masters as Hark, Woo, and here, Ringo Lam, you just observe one golden rule.  As Bruce Lee once said, &quot;Don't think; just feel.&quot;  Got it?So, apply that to Lam's latest film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, the action star whose cinematic status even now I cannot still fathom.  This time, however, Van Damme exhibits his flair for hard-core action with not-so-terrible acting.  You might feel dismayed to hear that he plays two roles -- one is a serial killer Garrotte who goes by the name of &quot;Torch&quot; because you know why -- and the other being a replicant made for the purpose of you know what.  The story is admittedly not important; it is those action scenes that count, and &quot;Replicant&quot; provides them, to our surprise, in a fairly good form.  I presume to think that you seldom watch a car not only blown up high into the air, but thrust into a flight of stairs in a burning building.  But that kind of thing happens in Lam's films, one of which once happened to feature Van Damme (namely &quot;Maximum Risk&quot;) in the past.The acting, if you ask me, is just slightly average, but frankly, I was not a little astonished to find that Van Damme can exude this amount of threatening menace of a creepy killer.  Though sometimes his acting as the &quot;Replicant&quot; goes beyound our belief, there is no particular complaint about Van Damme's work.  Besides, we get a precious aid from Michael Rooker, whose tough-guy image is always welcome when the storyline sags.  Overall it's a (slightly) above average action film.Michael Rooker himself played a serial killer in a cult film &quot;Henry,&quot; and then played a replicant again in &quot;The Sixth Day.&quot;  And now he is playing an ex-cop who chases the one with a help from the other!",3,Average Action Film From Van Damme - Lam Collaboration,1020643200,"05 6, 2002",2002,1828,"['When', 'watch', 'action', 'flicks', 'such', 'Hong-Kong', 'masters', 'Hark', 'Woo', 'here', 'Ringo', 'Lam', 'just', 'observe', 'one', 'golden', 'rule', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'once', 'said', 'quot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'just', 'feel.', 'quot', 'Got', 'So', 'apply', 'Lam', 'latest', 'film', 'starring', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'action', 'star', 'cinematic', 'status', 'even', 'now', 'can', 'not', 'still', 'fathom', 'time', 'however', 'Van', 'Damme', 'flair', 'hard-core', 'action', 'not-so-terrible', 'acting', 'might', 'feel', 'dismayed', 'hear', 'two', 'roles', 'one', 'serial', 'killer', 'Garrotte', 'who', 'name', 'quot', 'Torch', 'quot', 'know', 'why', 'other', 'being', 'replicant', 'made', 'purpose', 'know', 'what', 'story', 'admittedly', 'not', 'important', 'action', 'scenes', 'count', 'quot', 'Replicant', 'quot', 'surprise', 'fairly', 'good', 'form', 'presume', 'think', 'seldom', 'watch', 'car', 'not', 'only', 'blown', 'up', 'high', 'air', 'thrust', 'flight', 'stairs', 'burning', 'building', 'kind', 'thing', 'happens', 'Lam', 'films', 'one', 'once', 'happened', 'feature', 'Van', 'Damme', 'namely', 'quot', 'Maximum', 'Risk', 'quot', 'past.The', 'acting', 'ask', 'just', 'slightly', 'average', 'frankly', 'was', 'not', 'little', 'astonished', 'find', 'Van', 'Damme', 'can', 'exude', 'amount', 'threatening', 'menace', 'creepy', 'killer', 'sometimes', 'acting', 'quot', 'Replicant', 'quot', 'belief', 'particular', 'complaint', 'Van', 'Damme', 'work', 'get', 'precious', 'aid', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'tough-guy', 'image', 'always', 'welcome', 'when', 'storyline', 'sags', 'Overall', 'slightly', 'average', 'action', 'film.Michael', 'Rooker', 'played', 'serial', 'killer', 'cult', 'film', 'quot', 'Henry', 'quot', 'then', 'played', 'replicant', 'again', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Day.', 'quot', 'now', 'playing', 'ex-cop', 'who', 'one', 'help', 'other']",N/A
