Its the classic woman stepping into forbidden men-only turf in the beginning. Everyone dislikes The new vicar from the get-go until they get to know her. And I will admit I kind of saw Gerry getting together with David because it seemed thats where they were building it up in across some episodes and it would have made sense but I guess they changed thier minds when by the last set, Wholly Happy Ending, when they introduced someone new for her to tangle with at first before she realized he wasnt such a bad guy even for a 'Townie'. Kind of like how the villagers found out Gerry wasnt so bad after they got to know her. But it does make one wonder why take it, the story, one way then toss it aside and go another way instead... unless they were running out of time towards the end. But anyway I laughed through the whole thing and im very glad I gave this a shot.Series 1/Disc 1ArrivalSongs of PraiseCommunity SpiritThe Window and the WeatherElectionAnimalsSeries 2/Disc 2The Easter BunnyThe Christmas Lunch IncidentEngagementDibley LiveCelebrity VicarLove and MarriageSeries 3/Disc3 - Seems like rather plain titles to me, maybe ran out of ideas?AutumnWinterSpringSummer*A documentary in the extras section about real VicarsDisc 4Merry ChristmasHappy New Year*And the hilarious outtakes/bloopers reel in the Extras sectionDisc 5 - A Wholly Happy EndingThe Handsome StrangerThe Vicar in White*Vicar of Dibley reunion/special in the Extras section",5,The Vicar of Dibley - The Immaculate Collection,1325289600,"12 31, 2011",2011,1652,"['starters', 'Im', 'not', 'particularly', 'religous', 'wasnt', 'sure', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'series', 'was', 'hilarious', 'have', 'agree', 'like', 'most', 'BBC', 'programs', 'then', 'Youre', 'going', 'like', 'one', 'too', 'classic', 'woman', 'stepping', 'forbidden', 'men-only', 'turf', 'beginning', 'Everyone', 'new', 'vicar', 'get-go', 'get', 'know', 'will', 'admit', 'kind', 'saw', 'Gerry', 'getting', 'together', 'David', 'seemed', 'thats', 'where', 'were', 'building', 'up', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'sense', 'guess', 'changed', 'thier', 'minds', 'when', 'last', 'set', 'Wholly', 'Happy', 'Ending', 'when', 'introduced', 'someone', 'new', 'tangle', 'first', 'realized', 'wasnt', 'bad', 'guy', 'even', ""'Townie"", 'Kind', 'how', 'villagers', 'found', 'out', 'Gerry', 'so', 'bad', 'got', 'know', 'make', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'take', 'story', 'one', 'way', 'then', 'aside', 'go', 'way', 'instead', 'were', 'running', 'out', 'time', 'end', 'anyway', 'laughed', 'whole', 'thing', 'im', 'very', 'glad', 'gave', 'shot.Series', '1/Disc', '1ArrivalSongs', 'PraiseCommunity', 'SpiritThe', 'Window', 'WeatherElectionAnimalsSeries', '2/Disc', '2The', 'Easter', 'BunnyThe', 'Christmas', 'Lunch', 'IncidentEngagementDibley', 'LiveCelebrity', 'VicarLove', 'MarriageSeries', '3/Disc3', 'Seems', 'rather', 'plain', 'titles', 'maybe', 'ran', 'ideas', 'AutumnWinterSpringSummer*A', 'documentary', 'extras', 'section', 'real', 'VicarsDisc', '4Merry', 'ChristmasHappy', 'New', 'Year*And', 'hilarious', 'outtakes/bloopers', 'reel', 'Extras', 'sectionDisc', '5', 'Wholly', 'Happy', 'EndingThe', 'Handsome', 'StrangerThe', 'Vicar', 'White*Vicar', 'Dibley', 'reunion/special', 'Extras', 'section']",VICAR OF DIBLEY: IMMACULATE COL (DVD)

If you all ready have the Divine Collection all you really need to get is Holy Wholly Happy Ending DVD, it has ""The Handsome Stranger"" (2006) and ""Vicar In White"" (2006). If you haven't gotten the Vicar Of Dibley collection yet, this is the one to get ""The Immaculate Collection"" has the entire series, all the specials and features including the above mentioned 2006 episodes. It's a nice way to end the series if there are to be no more Vicar Of Dibley specials or episodes. I hope there may be. The only thing I am curious about with regards to the series is that it is mentioned that Geraldine Grainger's (the vicar) real first name is Bodicia (I may not have spelled it correctly). In the Vicar In White finale, it's said her name is Geraldine Julie Andrews Dick Van Dyke Supercalifragalisticexpalidocious Chim Chim Chury Grainger (again, my spelling may not be right here), just wanted to know why the change?

There were tidbits of comments by the director and creator and others, but I would've liked more of that.

Muir ""oldies and pies lover""","[5, 5]","There are very few comedies which are written and acted with such warmth that they repay watching over and over again, but this is one of them. Starting with the idea of a woman coming to a small village parish as the new vicar, the series creates a host of unforgettable characters revolving around the charismatic Dawn French as Geraldine Granger, the eponymous vicar. Her kindness and vulnerability give the show the anchor it needs to explore the vagaries of (wholly imaginary) British village life. David Horton, the stuffy and uptight chairman of the parish council, his cheerful, well-meaning but incredibly vague son Hugo, Frank Pickle (the 'most boring man in England'), stuttering Jim Trott, earthy farmer Owen Newitt, Letty Cropley aka the world's worst cook and the barely sentient verger Alice Tinker.... all wonderfully well-written and acted characters that play off each other like a chamber orchestra, piling absurdity on absurdity as they move further and further from the real world.Over 13 years, several series and numerous specials the series deservedly became one of Britain's best-loved and watched comedies. The show is at its best when the humor is at its most surreal, and it's here that French's ability to remain credible is so vital. Unlike some other shows, Vicar Of Dibley never loses its humanity and there's a touching moment in almost every program, amid the madness.Perhaps the funniest character, although the competition is very stiff, is Alice, played by Emma Chambers. It's hard to play a character who is extremely simple (an example: when the parish newspaper runs the story that her fiance is going to marry the verger, Alice is almost in tears until it is pointed out to her that she IS the verger) without descending into mawkishness, but Chambers does it brilliantly. We laugh at her character's eccentricities without ever feeling that she should be pitied. Don't worry, everything turns out splendidly for Alice in the end!Most people with a sense of the ridiculous will get a real kick out of this show and a feeling of well-being from watching genuinely funny and original work. Watch it several times to get all the nuances- and don't skip the credits and Geraldine's joke which closes every episode. This collection, as well as including every episode and special, has various bonus features, interviews and behind the scenes footage which are entertaining in themselves.Thoroughly recommended.",5,Give us this day our daily vicar,1338422400,"05 31, 2012",2012,2446,"['are', 'very', 'few', 'comedies', 'are', 'written', 'acted', 'such', 'warmth', 'repay', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'one', 'Starting', 'idea', 'woman', 'coming', 'small', 'village', 'parish', 'new', 'vicar', 'series', 'host', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'revolving', 'charismatic', 'Dawn', 'French', 'Geraldine', 'Granger', 'eponymous', 'vicar', 'kindness', 'vulnerability', 'give', 'show', 'anchor', 'explore', 'vagaries', 'wholly', 'imaginary', 'British', 'village', 'life', 'David', 'Horton', 'stuffy', 'uptight', 'chairman', 'parish', 'council', 'cheerful', 'well-meaning', 'incredibly', 'vague', 'son', 'Hugo', 'Frank', 'Pickle', ""'most"", 'boring', 'man', 'England', 'stuttering', 'Jim', 'Trott', 'earthy', 'farmer', 'Owen', 'Newitt', 'Letty', 'Cropley', 'world', 'worst', 'cook', 'barely', 'sentient', 'verger', 'Alice', 'Tinker', 'wonderfully', 'well-written', 'acted', 'characters', 'play', 'other', 'chamber', 'orchestra', 'piling', 'absurdity', 'absurdity', 'move', 'further', 'further', 'real', 'world.Over', '13', 'years', 'several', 'series', 'numerous', 'specials', 'series', 'deservedly', 'became', 'one', 'Britain', 'best-loved', 'watched', 'comedies', 'show', 'best', 'when', 'humor', 'most', 'surreal', 'here', 'French', 'ability', 'remain', 'credible', 'so', 'vital', 'other', 'shows', 'Vicar', 'Dibley', 'never', 'humanity', 'touching', 'moment', 'almost', 'program', 'madness.Perhaps', 'funniest', 'character', 'competition', 'very', 'stiff', 'Alice', 'played', 'Emma', 'Chambers', 'hard', 'play', 'character', 'who', 'extremely', 'simple', 'example', 'when', 'parish', 'newspaper', 'story', 'fiance', 'going', 'marry', 'verger', 'Alice', 'almost', 'tears', 'pointed', 'verger', 'descending', 'mawkishness', 'Chambers', 'brilliantly', 'laugh', 'character', 'eccentricities', 'ever', 'feeling', 'should', 'be', 'pitied', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'everything', 'out', 'splendidly', 'Alice', 'end', 'Most', 'people', 'sense', 'ridiculous', 'will', 'get', 'real', 'kick', 'show', 'feeling', 'well-being', 'watching', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'original', 'work', 'Watch', 'several', 'times', 'get', 'nuances-', 'do', ""n't"", 'skip', 'credits', 'Geraldine', 'joke', 'episode', 'collection', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'episode', 'special', 'various', 'bonus', 'features', 'interviews', 'scenes', 'footage', 'are', 'entertaining', 'themselves.Thoroughly', 'recommended']",VICAR OF DIBLEY: IMMACULATE COL (DVD)

It is a brilliant series.The actors and characters are superb, along with the script and epidode plots. The Brits are just so good at this type of thing. If you're a prude you're going to be offended by some of the comments and scenes.So, if you're sick of political shows, down-and-out newspaper articles and want to completely remove yourself from today's stupidity, get this series and watch it...but not all at once.
