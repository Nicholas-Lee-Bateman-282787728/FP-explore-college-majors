Essentially, this is a filmed extension of the legendary Robin Harris comedy routine of the same name.Unfortnately, Robin himself died before this got off the ground. Faizon Love does a decent imitation of the master, but it just isn't the same. The story of the buckwild demons (excuseme, I mean kids) turned loose in an amusement park has its moments, but wears thin after a while (espeically the courtroom scene with Presidents George Washington, Lincoln, and Nixon putting the bratocious ones on trial). However, the film makes a grim detour in reality by showing the empty kitchen in the wild kids' equally empty ghetto apartment to make some pointed social commentary on why they are so untamed.This is interesting, but not likely to be viewed more than twice if you get the DVD.",3,"Interesting, but.....",1188604800,"09 1, 2007",2007,893,"['was', 'actually', 'first', 'Black-made', 'feature', 'cartoon', 'brought', 'Bruce', 'W.', 'Smith', 'PROUD', 'FAMILY', 'fame', 'Essentially', 'filmed', 'extension', 'legendary', 'Robin', 'Harris', 'comedy', 'routine', 'same', 'name.Unfortnately', 'Robin', 'died', 'got', 'off', 'ground', 'Faizon', 'Love', 'decent', 'imitation', 'master', 'just', ""n't"", 'same', 'story', 'buckwild', 'demons', 'excuseme', 'mean', 'kids', 'turned', 'loose', 'amusement', 'park', 'moments', 'wears', 'thin', 'while', 'espeically', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'Presidents', 'George', 'Washington', 'Lincoln', 'Nixon', 'putting', 'bratocious', 'ones', 'trial', 'However', 'film', 'grim', 'detour', 'reality', 'showing', 'empty', 'kitchen', 'wild', 'kids', 'equally', 'empty', 'ghetto', 'apartment', 'make', 'pointed', 'social', 'commentary', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'untamed.This', 'interesting', 'not', 'likely', 'be', 'viewed', 'more', 'twice', 'get', 'DVD']",Bebe's Kids VHS

I loved this movie when I was little and still do. Its even funnier now that I'm older because i caught on to some jokes I never noticed when I was little.Its safe for me to say that to fully enjoy this movie you have to relate or have an understanding (primarily the jokes)of what goes on in this movie. Bebe kids is an example of this because the funny thing about the trio is just about every family (primarily black families) know bebe kids. I have bebe kids in my family but not as extreme as the kids in this movie and that made it even more funny. Matter of fact all the characters in this movie I could relate to in some shape or form because I've seen or knew peaple like them.I hear many peaple argue its offensive too, but as a black woman myself Its safe for me to say that this movie didn't offend me in anyway. I found everything funny and even clever in many spots.My only gripe is the price of this movie. I was excited when I saw Amazon had it, but am baffled at the price tag for it. Almost $30!

Nothing more offensive than The Simpsons or Roger Rabbit but something of a hidden gem.Bebe's Kids takes much of Robin Harris, a stand-up comedian also featured from the House Party films, and his skits about these bad, irresponsible children to animation with Harris and a woman named Jamika he met exaggerated to a scenario where Harris has to take care of them at a theme park in place of Bebe's leave. The story is a little more than a one-note scenario but does provide for some laughs (much into how the 80s/90s culture was at the time), some amusing songs (especially much of the timeless 90s R&B; jams), and a sympathetic yet quirky Harris who, in the bachelor in all of us, can relate to. The animation for its time does not feel too cheap but definitely is not a Disney or Warner Bros. film.Thankfully, what stands out is how the film allows it to have a sense of energy and oddity in its steps that for many animated films of its time, was something to look forward to. It was exaggerated and crazy but still realistic and believable enough.While the film might not be South Park-level content, there is enough mild bad language (ass, damn, hell at most), oblique innuendos (flirting mostly), drinking, smoking, and reckless behaviour and mayhem from the children that could make some parents a bit worried if showing to a younger child.
