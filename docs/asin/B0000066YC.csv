It is hard to remember the details since I am reviewing this years later. I am sure it was corny and not cool to a lot of people. But, I love corny. It is crazy how people always have to change or realize things after and not during. So strange. I never understood. I appreciate all things in the moment. You tend to wish for things you do not have or for things to be different. But, I would never seriously wish it. I may think it, but I love my family. No exchanging for me! :-D",5,Haha,1397174400,"04 11, 2014",2014,577,"['enjoy', 'most', 'things', 'life', 'So', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'review', 'things', 'did', 'enjoy', 'hard', 'remember', 'details', 'am', 'reviewing', 'years', 'later', 'am', 'sure', 'was', 'corny', 'not', 'cool', 'lot', 'people', 'love', 'corny', 'crazy', 'how', 'people', 'always', 'have', 'change', 'realize', 'things', 'not', 'So', 'strange', 'never', 'understood', 'appreciate', 'things', 'moment', 'tend', 'wish', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'things', 'be', 'different', 'would', 'never', 'seriously', 'wish', 'may', 'think', 'love', 'family', 'No', 'exchanging', '-D']",N/A

Of course, we appreciated it on different levels, but as soon as we finished watching it we were in complete agreement: ""Again!!"" Immediately we had to see Trading Mom a second time!If you have not seen this film before, you really must. Cissy Spacek is a total delight as the Mom (the real one) and in other roles. The children are quite natural in their performances, but I wish Maureen Stapleton had more screen time. This is a movie that we will be thinking about and watching again and again.However -- I must complain: WHERE is the DVD version of Trading Mom? Amazon.com has the poster and the VHS, but we need the updated version.",5,Magical film teaches a lovely lesson!,1404259200,"07 2, 2014",2014,743,"['watched', 'film', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'were', 'riveted', 'film', 'course', 'appreciated', 'different', 'levels', 'as', 'soon', 'finished', 'watching', 'were', 'complete', 'agreement', 'Again', 'Immediately', 'had', 'see', 'Trading', 'Mom', 'second', 'time', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'really', 'must', 'Cissy', 'Spacek', 'total', 'delight', 'Mom', 'real', 'one', 'other', 'roles', 'children', 'are', 'quite', 'natural', 'performances', 'wish', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'had', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'thinking', 'watching', 'again', 'again.However', 'must', 'complain', 'WHERE', 'DVD', 'version', 'Trading', 'Mom', 'Amazon.com', 'poster', 'VHS', 'need', 'updated', 'version']",N/A

It seems there are many movies that are not out on DVD and most of them were really good movies. Yet as always they release the stupid movies that don't even make a hit at the box office and our most recent. I think that if modern filmmakers took a look at some of these great gems like trading mom and other excellent family features they could learn something. These days I find it hard to watch a new family feature that doesn't have some sort of sexual.innuendo or violent subject matter,4,Put it on DVD already!!!!,1403654400,"06 25, 2014",2014,626,"['movie', 'lot', 'great', 'memories', 'childhood', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'not', 'putting', 'out', 'DVD', 'really', 'very', 'sad', 'are', 'many', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'DVD', 'most', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'movies', 'always', 'release', 'stupid', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'hit', 'box', 'office', 'most', 'recent', 'think', 'modern', 'filmmakers', 'took', 'look', 'great', 'gems', 'trading', 'mom', 'other', 'excellent', 'family', 'features', 'could', 'learn', 'something', 'days', 'find', 'hard', 'watch', 'new', 'family', 'feature', ""n't"", 'have', 'sort', 'sexual.innuendo', 'violent', 'subject', 'matter']",N/A
