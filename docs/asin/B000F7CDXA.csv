984218,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,B000F7CDXA,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[0, 0]","""Allo Allo!"" Has been around since 1982 and has just recently become available in the USA on a decent media.Basic story is of a caf&eacute; owner Ren&eacute;; this is in France during the WWII occupation. He must balance dealing with the local Germans, the Gestapo, the good Resistance, the commie Resistance, having affairs with his female help, dealing with his wife and mother-in-law.In series five we get more action from the communist resistance; frankly I think the commie resistance has cuter girls and adds some fresh characters to the mix. And be sure to keep your eye on the homing duck.One nice thing about this series is that they place the name next to the actor at the end of each episode. Most of the actors are well known out side of this series. I was shocked however to find that Gestapo Herr Otto Flick (Richard Gibson) Played British Capt. Newman in Ken Follett's ""The Key to Rebecca"" (1985) and completely changed his accent.Allo 'Allo!: Complete Series Nine",5,It is I Leclerc,1350086400,"10 13, 2012",2012,979,"['Allo', 'Allo', 'been', '1982', 'just', 'recently', 'become', 'available', 'USA', 'decent', 'media.Basic', 'story', 'caf', 'eacute', 'owner', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'France', 'WWII', 'occupation', 'must', 'balance', 'dealing', 'local', 'Germans', 'Gestapo', 'good', 'Resistance', 'commie', 'Resistance', 'having', 'affairs', 'female', 'help', 'dealing', 'wife', 'mother-in-law.In', 'series', 'five', 'get', 'more', 'action', 'communist', 'resistance', 'frankly', 'think', 'commie', 'resistance', 'cuter', 'girls', 'fresh', 'characters', 'mix', 'be', 'sure', 'keep', 'eye', 'homing', 'duck.One', 'nice', 'thing', 'series', 'place', 'name', 'next', 'actor', 'end', 'episode', 'Most', 'actors', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'out', 'side', 'series', 'was', 'shocked', 'however', 'find', 'Gestapo', 'Herr', 'Otto', 'Flick', 'Richard', 'Gibson', 'Played', 'British', 'Capt', 'Newman', 'Ken', 'Follett', 'Key', 'Rebecca', '1985', 'completely', 'changed', 'accent.Allo', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Nine']",N/A

I missed the departure of a couple of characters in season three, but the show was back in stride with this season. It is very very funny. The bizarre Herr Flick episodes have be trimmed and changed to make them funnier and less redundant. Jack Haig shines as LeClare and there are some very funny scenes where his schtick is stolen by a couple of the main characters. Marner and Siner shine in this season as well. The newer characters have settled in and add to the fun and enjoyment.
