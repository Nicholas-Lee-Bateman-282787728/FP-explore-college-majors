From reading the other reviews I wasn't expecting anything of great quiality, I just wanted to own it. But, as other reviewers have said, it's pretty poor. The sets are cheaply made due to an obviously low budget. The acting aside from the Phantom and Christine was terrible. The guys playing the Persian and Bouquet were some of the worst actors I've ever seen. The costuming for the Phantom and Raoul were probably ripped off of the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage version. And as one other reviewer commented, there really isn't a single memorable song in this thing! Most of them are down right terrible and the orchestra sounded very quiet. I give this 2 stars for the prosthetic for our beloved Phantom which looks really good, surprisingly compared to the rest of the crappy production. And of course as everyone who's seen this knows, the ending is completely unlike the phantom at all. IT'S SO BAD!!!! The production value is next to nothing.If you're a big Phantom Phan, then go ahead and get the movie, otherwise don't waste your money.

346625,A1XSXUBCNFIM3W,6302940591,Jim Jr,"[31, 41]","Today it is vital that ""Phantom of the Opera"" be about MUSIC. The Lon Chaney version is marvelous as a dramatic presentation, but a viewer does miss the music (even if they have a version with an instrumental sound track). This awful production does not have one decent or memorable song. In fact, you wish it were a silent version. The only memorable piece of music is the classical ""Danse Macabre"" played at the masked ball. The ""original"" music for this production is a waste of time. There is not one number that can be remembered even 10 seconds after is has been played. After hearing the first number, you want to grab the remote and push the ""mute"" button whenever another song is started.The script is unbelievably inept. Not one scene builds to a dramatic climax. They just sort of end without reason or emotion. One of the great things about any other version is that the audience is made to care about Eric (the Phantom), Christine and Raoul. The only feeling this script envokes is BOREDOM. A few scenes are mildly (and I stress ""mildly"") amusing, but this is the only emotion a viewer can hope for.In the novel, Christine and Raoul go off and their future is not revealed, but it is stated that the skeleton of the Phantom is discovered years later wearing the ring he had given Christine and she returned when she left. There is none of the ""pick the next Miss Phantom Girl"" that ends this version. Even with Eric being a monster both in looks and actions, there is a certain pity for him in all other versions. This version leaves you with a feeling he got what he deserved when Christine left.It was filmed before a live audience and even their reactions are only half hearted, applause after some scenes and songs, no reactions after others. It almost seems that the audience is in disbelief about what they are seeing. The sets are all small and cheap looking. The theater stage obviously could not accomodate decent settings.This is the worst version of ""Phantom"" that can be imagined.

The costumes, the sets, the classical and operatic music, as well as Rosen and Schierhorn's original music (you need to hear it more than once, just like Lloyd Webbers when it first came out) are all perfect fits for this story with music as the main thread.  The performances are exceptional...watch David Staller's gloved hands and his eyes, Elizabeth Walsh' voice and acting are warm, as the DVD cover says, and the rest of the cast gives memorable performances.

This small low budget production meant for a small theatre and PBS was one, the production of ""Phantom the Musical"" by Yeston and Kopit was another.All three actually had their moments.ALW's version went onto legend-hood. Yeston and Kopit's did quite well in regional theatres and eventually became sans music the Charles Dance mini-series, the third, this one, well that became what I can only call a ""sleeper musical"" in a lot of ways.The fact that it's even available now is because it has quite a surprising and loyal following.I first saw it in a neighborhood theatre on a rainy day and I had NO idea of what I was seeing. I just happened to walk by and saw the marquee and being a LeRoux's Phantom fan I decided to check it out.I walked out with ""Perfect Music"" and David Staller's performance STUCK in my head. So much so that I had to see it again, and again. Three times that week before the film ended it's run I went back to see the little Phantom film because something about it touched me utterly.Time went on, several years passed, and yet I never forgot that version, in fact I looked for a tape for quite a while to no avail. Then, one day, wandering the streets of NYC I came across a homeless guy selling a bunch of homemade tapes one of which was labeled POTO. I bought it, mainly to give the poor guy a buck, and much to my surprise and delight it was an audio tape of Staller in rehersals for the musical! It wasn't the whole play, just a few bits and pieces but it quite tickled me listening to it, and I found myself once again enchanted by Staller's Erik and in particlar the song ""Perfect Music.""Oddly enough less than a month later I opened up the newspaper and there was an ad for a Cole Porter musical review at the Algonquin hotel starring David Staller an actor I had never seen in anything else!Being a Cole Porter fan, and thinking that with his voice it was likely to be a lovely performance, I called the hotel's number, mentioned that I had seen Staller's Phantom and was interested in seeing his Porter show.Much to my amazement I was connected to Mr Staller's room and about 10 minutes and one nice conversation later I found myself invited to the show as his guest!It WAS a great show. Cole Porter and the voice of David Staller? Now that's a STUNNING combination! More  than that the guy was just a lovely person besides!At the time I asked him if his Phantom was EVER going to be released and he said it would depend on a lot of things, rights and so forth, but that he hoped so.I think it was about a decade until it actually showed up, but you know what? Everytime I pop it in the viewer I really DO believe it was worth the long wait!No, it's not a Broadway production. Heck it's not even an OFF Broadway production, but for a small locally-produced musical it's not half bad! The two main leads are lovely singers and can actually act, the supporting players are funny, and contrary to statements above I personally found at least two songs memorable enough that 10 years later I they were still in my brain enough that I truly wanted to hear them again!From what I understand David Staller's career has been a modest one. Frankly, I don't see why. The man has far more range than you'd think, this simple production doesn't even begin to cover it. This guy really SHOULD have stepped into Crawford's shoes on Broadway or at the very least made a lovely Raoul...But at least there's this....This modest but IMHO truly enchanting Phantom....:)",5,Au Contraire....,1160179200,"10 7, 2006",2006,3758,"['little', 'musical', ""n't"", 'big-budget', 'bravado', 'production', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'IMHO', 'more', 'watch', 'three', 'were', 'two', 'OTHER', 'musical', 'POTO', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'Webber', 'grand', 'musical', 'did', 'small', 'low', 'budget', 'production', 'meant', 'small', 'theatre', 'PBS', 'was', 'one', 'production', 'Phantom', 'Musical', 'Yeston', 'Kopit', 'was', 'another.All', 'three', 'actually', 'had', 'moments.ALW', 'version', 'went', 'legend-hood', 'Yeston', 'Kopit', 'did', 'quite', 'well', 'regional', 'theatres', 'eventually', 'became', 'sans', 'music', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'mini-series', 'third', 'one', 'well', 'became', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'call', 'sleeper', 'musical', 'lot', 'ways.The', 'fact', 'even', 'available', 'now', 'quite', 'surprising', 'loyal', 'following.I', 'first', 'saw', 'neighborhood', 'theatre', 'rainy', 'day', 'had', 'NO', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'seeing', 'just', 'happened', 'walk', 'saw', 'marquee', 'being', 'LeRoux', 'Phantom', 'fan', 'decided', 'check', 'out.I', 'walked', 'out', 'Perfect', 'Music', 'David', 'Staller', 'performance', 'STUCK', 'head', 'So', 'much', 'had', 'see', 'again', 'again', 'Three', 'times', 'week', 'film', 'ended', 'run', 'went', 'back', 'see', 'little', 'Phantom', 'film', 'something', 'touched', 'utterly.Time', 'went', 'several', 'years', 'passed', 'yet', 'never', 'forgot', 'version', 'fact', 'looked', 'tape', 'quite', 'while', 'avail', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'wandering', 'streets', 'NYC', 'came', 'homeless', 'guy', 'selling', 'bunch', 'homemade', 'tapes', 'one', 'was', 'labeled', 'POTO', 'bought', 'mainly', 'give', 'poor', 'guy', 'buck', 'much', 'surprise', 'delight', 'was', 'audio', 'tape', 'Staller', 'rehersals', 'musical', 'was', ""n't"", 'whole', 'play', 'just', 'few', 'bits', 'pieces', 'quite', 'tickled', 'listening', 'found', 'once', 'again', 'enchanted', 'Staller', 'Erik', 'particlar', 'song', 'Perfect', 'Music', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'less', 'month', 'later', 'opened', 'up', 'newspaper', 'was', 'ad', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'musical', 'review', 'Algonquin', 'hotel', 'starring', 'David', 'Staller', 'actor', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'else', 'Being', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'fan', 'thinking', 'voice', 'was', 'likely', 'be', 'lovely', 'performance', 'called', 'hotel', 'number', 'mentioned', 'had', 'seen', 'Staller', 'Phantom', 'was', 'interested', 'seeing', 'Porter', 'show.Much', 'amazement', 'was', 'connected', 'Mr', 'Staller', 'room', '10', 'minutes', 'one', 'nice', 'conversation', 'later', 'found', 'invited', 'show', 'guest', 'WAS', 'great', 'show', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'voice', 'David', 'Staller', 'Now', 'STUNNING', 'combination', 'More', 'guy', 'was', 'just', 'lovely', 'person', 'time', 'asked', 'Phantom', 'was', 'EVER', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'said', 'would', 'depend', 'lot', 'things', 'rights', 'so', 'forth', 'hoped', 'so.I', 'think', 'was', 'decade', 'actually', 'showed', 'up', 'know', 'what', 'Everytime', 'pop', 'viewer', 'really', 'DO', 'believe', 'was', 'worth', 'long', 'wait', 'No', 'not', 'Broadway', 'production', 'Heck', 'not', 'even', 'OFF', 'Broadway', 'production', 'small', 'locally-produced', 'musical', 'not', 'half', 'bad', 'two', 'main', 'leads', 'are', 'lovely', 'singers', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'funny', 'contrary', 'statements', 'personally', 'found', 'least', 'two', 'songs', 'memorable', 'enough', '10', 'years', 'later', 'were', 'still', 'brain', 'truly', 'wanted', 'hear', 'again', 'what', 'understand', 'David', 'Staller', 'career', 'been', 'modest', 'one', 'Frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'man', 'far', 'more', 'range', ""'d"", 'think', 'simple', 'production', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'cover', 'guy', 'really', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'stepped', 'Crawford', 'shoes', 'Broadway', 'very', 'least', 'made', 'lovely', 'Raoul', 'least', '.This', 'modest', 'IMHO', 'truly', 'enchanting', 'Phantom']",N/A

346632,A2JHYW5V7UFIQ2,6302940591,"R. C. Walker ""catu11us""","[2, 2]","I have always been a collector - stamps, books, chess sets, music, and so on, 60-years of it.  Current craze is of course DVDs.  Collectors generally compulsively hang on to something once they've acquired it - even if it turns out to be a piece of drek.  You will therefore understand that - while it was a wrench - I've 86d this little item from my collection.  And I'm aboaut to tell you why.The Phantom of the Opera is, like Dracula or Frankenstein (the monster's correct name since he would have the name of his father), an iconic figure from the lushly Romantic (as opposed to romantic) horror literature of the 19th Century.  The Phantom exists in a number of celluloid versions, although inexplicably not so many as the endlessly dreary zombie films.  At least, thank the gods, there are no zombie musicals.The story line of this production pretty much follows (if sketchily) that of the Gaston Leroux novel on which the whole ""Phantom"" phenomenon is based.  There is no need to rehearse this, since those who don't already know it ... well, what can I say?The music for this production is, at best, kitschy and banal, more or less on a par with the alleged music Disney provides for their teeny-bopper programming.  There is only one even remotely good musical number - and that is a very bad arrangement of Camille St.Sans' ""Danse Macabre"".  This accompanies the sc&egrave;ne-ballet which follows the Phantom's unmasking.  Missing from the production entirely is any hint of the music to the Phantom's grande-oeuvre, ""Don Juan Triumphant"".The acting is no better.  Indeed, it isn't acting at all; it's mere declamation.  I've heard better delivery from used-car commercials.This is of course a cut-rate production, complete with barely OK sets and obviously plastic prosthetics.  Indeed, the Phantom's mask is far more realistic than his alleged disfigurements.  We did get a falling chandelier - not badly done, actually.I've seen this billed on some sites as a ""musical comedy"".  It isn't - it's a serious if inept performance.

The musical reminds me of the Broadway version of ""Peter Pan""However it is a musical and a good one The Andrew Lloyd Webber version does have more depth, thanks to Charles Hart's lyrics and is closer to the novel, but this musical DOES NOT SUCK. The music is beautiful, and the lyrics are direct, but provide a change in perspective that is enlightening to the legacy of the story, in mainly film, and WHY there are a group of ""Phans."" Erik says ""I am whatever you want me to be"" after seeing 35 versions I can tell you this is true, The musical explores the fact that people have come back to watch other VERSIONS of the story, and asks WHY. This version in the song ""Something Out There""  alludes to Erik being somewhat of of a Guardian Angel, capable of making your wildest dreams come true. I wish this version was long enough for that idea to be fully explored, for as an Andrew Lloyd Webber version Phan, I KNOW that is true.the music for the Masquerade I recognised from a version of Hansel and Gretel, one of my favorite fairy tales. :) You are set up for a Phantom darker in personality than what he is.

Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical is excellent, but his is definitely not the only one.  I  truly enjoyed this one.  It  captures  the seductive qualities that I have always seen in Erik.  I love the humor  and I do get a guilty pleasure out of that very last scene (with the ballet  dancer).  Just go on with life, Erik.  Hee hee.  Just go on.I adore  David Staller's voice.  He sounds a lot like the way I had always imagined  Erik to sound.  The makeup used for Erik's visage is one of the most loyal  to the descriptions provided by Leroux, Kay, and Siciliano I have seen in a  movie.  Lon Chaney, as much as I love the guy, gave Erik that look that  comes across to me as way too campy.  Staller's is for real, except I wish  they had not followed Andrew Lloyd Webber's half-mask, half-facial  deformity formula.Part of what some others may not like about this one  is that it does have that quirkiness that comes with trying to record a  live stage show.  I hope one day that it gets better adapted for a movie  like the Yestin &amp; Kopit musical had  been, the one starring Charles  Dance as Erik.  I mean, this is one of the few adaptations in which  Carlotta, Raoul, and even the Daroga are ALL made likeable.  Remind me to  send Carlotta some roses (sniff).  Remind me also to accompany the Daroga  in chasing Erik (tee hee) and to be Erik's audience for DON JUAN  TRIUMPHANT!",5,I LOVE IT!,947376000,"01 9, 2000",2000,1481,"['am', 'always', 'glad', 'when', 'new', 'movie', 'Erik', 'out', 'especially', 'when', 'done', 'musical', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'musical', 'excellent', 'definitely', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'seductive', 'qualities', 'have', 'always', 'seen', 'Erik', 'love', 'humor', 'do', 'get', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'Just', 'go', 'life', 'Erik', 'Hee', 'hee', 'Just', 'go', 'on.I', 'adore', 'David', 'Staller', 'voice', 'lot', 'way', 'had', 'always', 'imagined', 'Erik', 'sound', 'makeup', 'used', 'Erik', 'visage', 'one', 'most', 'loyal', 'descriptions', 'provided', 'Leroux', 'Kay', 'Siciliano', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'guy', 'gave', 'Erik', 'look', 'way', 'too', 'campy', 'Staller', 'real', 'wish', 'had', 'not', 'followed', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'half-mask', 'half-facial', 'deformity', 'formula.Part', 'what', 'others', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'one', 'have', 'quirkiness', 'trying', 'record', 'live', 'stage', 'show', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'better', 'adapted', 'movie', 'Yestin', 'amp', 'Kopit', 'musical', 'had', 'been', 'one', 'starring', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'Erik', 'mean', 'one', 'few', 'adaptations', 'Carlotta', 'Raoul', 'even', 'Daroga', 'are', 'ALL', 'made', 'likeable', 'Remind', 'send', 'Carlotta', 'roses', 'sniff', 'Remind', 'also', 'accompany', 'Daroga', 'chasing', 'Erik', 'tee', 'hee', 'be', 'Erik', 'audience', 'DON', 'JUAN', 'TRIUMPHANT']",N/A

Garlock ""Radical Feminist""","[1, 1]","Especially if you are looking for a reason to forgive the Hollywood version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical for its flaws.How this video found its way into my library I'll never know. How it got itself recorded for posterity's sakes is the more intriguing question.Although the ALW version is the most famous version of Phantom, there have also been several other musicals of it made. Maury Yeston (Broadway composer of NINE, GRAND HOTEL, TITANIC) made one (that never made it to Broadway but has been performed regionally and it is on cd), and these local composers also turned out a version. No matter what one thinks of this version, one does have to applaud the composers of this one for deciding to write their own even though they aren't ALW or Yeston.At any rate, I saw this at my library and decided to get it out. When one has listened to the ALW version for years, it is a struggle to keep an open mind and it took me two days to get through this 90 minute musical. Never did 90 minutes feel so long!It is just as bad as the other reviewers say it is. It does have one redeeming quality, but that is it. The sets are cheap, the makeup overdone (I cringed everytime, they did close-ups and had to turn away) except on the Phantom where the makeup artists did themselves justice. The songs are forgettable but remind you of Rodgers and Hammerstein but in a bad way.The acting is also not effective. What should be spooky or haunting comes across as ordinary and, in some cases, comic. The comedy where it is meant to be comedy is appropriate, but only reminds the viewer that this is an inferior version of the Phantom.Which brings me to its one redeeming quality. Christine as played by Elizabeth Walsh is a spirited, opinionated, and decisive girl. In the ALW version, Christine in the wrong hands can appear very, very spineless and can drive one crazy with her 'save me Raoul' bits. This Christine makes her an equal to the Phantom. The most effective acting comes from Walsh and it is her scene with the Phantom when she is with him in the lair the first time that is the most effective scene in this musical.So, for that reason, it is worth watching. You'll cringe most of the time or find yourself wondering how much more cheesier or craptistic it can get, and it does get boring to watch, but it does provide a nice example of a Christine with spirit.However, you should only buy this if you are a Phantom freak.",2,Craptistic Cheese worth checking out?,1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,2429,"['Especially', 'are', 'looking', 'reason', 'forgive', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'musical', 'flaws.How', 'video', 'found', 'way', 'library', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'How', 'got', 'recorded', 'posterity', 'sakes', 'more', 'intriguing', 'ALW', 'version', 'most', 'famous', 'version', 'Phantom', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'several', 'other', 'musicals', 'made', 'Maury', 'Yeston', 'Broadway', 'composer', 'NINE', 'GRAND', 'HOTEL', 'TITANIC', 'made', 'one', 'never', 'made', 'Broadway', 'been', 'performed', 'regionally', 'cd', 'local', 'composers', 'also', 'turned', 'out', 'version', 'matter', 'what', 'one', 'version', 'one', 'have', 'applaud', 'composers', 'one', 'deciding', 'write', 'own', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'ALW', 'Yeston.At', 'rate', 'saw', 'library', 'decided', 'get', 'out', 'When', 'one', 'listened', 'ALW', 'version', 'years', 'struggle', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'took', 'two', 'days', 'get', '90', 'minute', 'musical', 'Never', 'did', '90', 'minutes', 'feel', 'so', 'long', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'other', 'reviewers', 'say', 'have', 'one', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'sets', 'are', 'cheap', 'makeup', 'overdone', 'cringed', 'everytime', 'did', 'close-ups', 'had', 'turn', 'away', 'Phantom', 'where', 'makeup', 'artists', 'did', 'justice', 'songs', 'are', 'forgettable', 'remind', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'bad', 'way.The', 'acting', 'also', 'not', 'effective', 'What', 'should', 'be', 'spooky', 'haunting', 'ordinary', 'cases', 'comic', 'comedy', 'where', 'meant', 'be', 'comedy', 'appropriate', 'only', 'viewer', 'inferior', 'version', 'Phantom.Which', 'one', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'Christine', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Walsh', 'spirited', 'opinionated', 'decisive', 'girl', 'ALW', 'version', 'Christine', 'wrong', 'hands', 'can', 'appear', 'very', 'very', 'spineless', 'can', 'drive', 'one', 'crazy', ""'save"", 'Raoul', 'bits', 'Christine', 'equal', 'Phantom', 'most', 'effective', 'acting', 'Walsh', 'scene', 'Phantom', 'when', 'lair', 'first', 'time', 'most', 'effective', 'scene', 'musical.So', 'reason', 'worth', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'cringe', 'most', 'time', 'find', 'wondering', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'cheesier', 'craptistic', 'can', 'get', 'get', 'boring', 'watch', 'provide', 'nice', 'example', 'Christine', 'spirit.However', 'should', 'only', 'buy', 'are', 'Phantom', 'freak']",N/A

I was excited by the fact that it said on the back cover it was close to Leroux's book which is the original ""The Phantom of the Opera"". I was sadly mislead this book only contains a few items that were had any similarities with the book. One of them is the beginning when Raoul as a little boy gives Christine back her scarf. Secondly they decide to keep The Persian or ""Daroga"" as he is called in this show. After that there is nothing in common with Leroux's version. There's not even the chandelier falling! They make Erik (Phantom) look idiotic, (putting two ropes as a trap...he would be A LOT smarter than that where's the torture chamber?). The ending is so horrendous I can barely talk about it. First Raoul comes then instead of Erik trying to kill him or harm him he just lets him come in and Christine of course chooses him. Then Erik and ""Daroga"" almost fight which is very unlikely because in the book Daroga actually saves Erik's life. And after Christine chooses Raoul, Erik goes after a ballet corps girl, (this is highly unlikely I'm pretty sure he loved Christine alone). The middle is just as ghastly. Erik dances with Carlotta in a flirtatious manner. Carlotta doesn't end up croaking like a frog but sings like a man. The Masked Ball scene was horrible as well with Erik instead of appearing as the Red Death he came as a dragon or some other sort of beast. Joseph Burquet is killed with an axe; there is no mention of any Punjab lassos. And the original scene with Christine and Raoul on the Opera house's roof is marred like the other scenes with Erik not on top of the statue but hiding somewhere and just comes out of no where to confront them. He abducts Christine right then. The sound quality wasn't that great either I had to turn my television's voulume as loud as possible and still couldn't make out some of the sung words.
