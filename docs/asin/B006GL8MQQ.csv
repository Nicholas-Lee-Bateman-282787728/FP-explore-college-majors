1515142,A24PTVSZSM8968,B006GL8MQQ,Amazon Customer,"[1, 2]","This is one of those movies that has an intriguing premise. Two people share an apartment but spend alternate nights there and are attracted to each other via clues but don't meet until the end. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't live up to its potential. It starts out being a bit confusing. The scenes are visually crowded and it is difficult to feel comfortable with what is going on. Second, there are all sorts of odd side details of the characters' lives that detract from the story rather than add to it. Romantic movies like this often have people in dead-end relationships that end up together. In the case of this movie, one of the characters is in an inexplicable relationship with a ridiculous character who is supposed to be a French actress and the other one is in what appears to be a relatively happy marriage. Rather than being humorous, many of the scenes end up being silly or difficult to believe. The characters aren't really developed all that much. They just sort of appear as stock characters and don't change much. I really like Matthew Broderick's movie Addicted to Love. This movie seems to have a lot of the same types of themes and ideas, but it is more like a dry run that didn't have all of the kinks worked out quite yet. I see that a lot of people have given this movie a positive review. For me, it just didn't quite fulfill the promise suggested by the premise.

I settled on a 3 because even though the movie didn't live up to expectations, it did have good moments.  There were times when it felt like it was all over the place.  It should have focused more on Sam and Ellen, and less on the frat boy who didn't want to give up his bachelor pad.  There should have been more moments where Sam and Ellen connected even though they hadn't met.  I also think the character of Ellen shouldn't have been married.  Maybe she could have been written as someone who was in a long term relationship and living with a man who she was slowly falling out of love with.  Instead she came across as someone who was selfish while her husband was trying to make their marriage work (he bought her a house for goodness sake - what did the man have to do to make her happy????).I also found Jeanne Tripplehorn so annoying.  I couldn't understand her half the time.  What a waste of her talent.  Doris Roberts was also wasted in this movie.  With so many talented actors, this could have been sooooo much better.

It is one of my all time favorites and I had been waiting for years to finally see it released on dvd. I was a little disappointed that there are no extras whatsoever, but hey at least I got the movie.Anyway it is a ""Chick Flick"" comedy that a guy can like. Yes it is a light, but very entertaining movie about how the lives of three ""opposites"" intersect; Sam the cultured, pseudo-artsy, wannabee Chef, Ellen the disillusioned wife looking for her own space and Brian the Stockbroker party animal. Will the lives of these three people remain separate or will circumstances allow them to meet, even though they are never at the apartment on the same days? This is a nice film with a clever story and script. Only in the Big Apple, I suppose, would you find folks willing to rent a place for only two nights a week. The cast is terrific, with Broderick, especially, giving a very funny and touching performance. As for the costumes, sets and production values, they are great, resulting in a movie that looks mighty nice. If you are a romantic comedy fan, you can't miss this one!
