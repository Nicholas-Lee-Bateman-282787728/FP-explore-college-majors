515042,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00002JWZT,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Having recently seen `The Kids Are All Right', I'd never have thought that this film was directed by the same person.  Aside from the obvious similarity (both films center around lesbians), the films are drastically different in tone; and yet their contextual assimilation is very in tune with each other.  Both films tap into something human and individual, revolving around relationships that shape out due to outside forces.  While I feel that the light comedic tones that fluttered throughout `The Kids Are All Right' helped propel it into an `excellent' movie as apposed to a `good' one, there is no denying that `High Art' is very, very good.The film follows a strangely intoxicating affair between a young magazine editor and a former photographer she is trying to draw back out into the limelight.Lucy Berliner was, at one time, on her way to the top.  Her work, photographically, was astonishing.  But the price of fame is conformism, and that was something Lucy couldn't handle; so she disappeared.  Years later she returns, but not in an outlandish or outgoing manner.  Holed up in a crummy apartment with her heroine addicted girlfriend, Lucy is drawn back out into the world of photography by her neighbor, a pretty, ambitious young woman named Syd.  Syd, during a chance encounter, discovers Lucy's work, unaware of her past.  Working for the magazine `Frame', which features photographers, Syd convinces Lucy to meet with her `all too eager' bosses to pitch the idea of doing a cover piece for the magazine.  Her agreement (with certain terms) has a price to pay for both women as they exploit one another for their own benefits only to fall deeply in love and suffer serious loss on account of it all.The films tone is very gritty and dark, and this plays well to the film's themes although I must admit that some of the film's layers don't wear as strongly as I wanted them too.  The performances are severely uneven and the script doesn't dig down deep enough to validate some of the character arcs.  It seems intent on one particular purpose (to pander to Lucy's emotional lapses) but it forgets to add some needed depth to the world that surrounds Lucy.Benefiting from the script is Ally Sheedy, who delivers what may be the best female performance of the 90's (contending single handedly with that `other' lesbian performance given by Hilary Swank).  The way she playfully endears the audience to Lucy while remaining mysteriously guarded and obviously emotionally disturbed is fantastic.  Her body language is unnerving.  I remember feeling similar about actress Kristen Scott-Thomas, a woman who can hold herself in remarkably natural positions that convey so much to the viewer.  Just watching Sheedy stand in a doorway was astonishingly moving.The rest of the performances suffer.Patricia Clarkson, an actress I normally find flawless, muddles her way through a strangely constructed Marlena Dietrick impersonation.  It is painful at times to watch, to be honest.  Radha Mitchell (who needs a better career) is somewhat vacant here.  I understand that that may have been intentional, allowing Ally Sheedy to play off of Mitchell's emotional void by projecting her own substancially heavier persona, but in the end it just made Syd appear one-dimentional.  She has her moments, and in those moments she shines (when that cover shot is taken, you can read a lot in that blank stare) but those moments are overshadowed by the bulk of the performance.  The rest of the cast, honestly, is not worth mentioning.I wish that a little more time had been placed in fleshing out the entirety of the situation, especially the dynamic between Syd and her sudden curiosity in the same sex, including her disintegrating relationship with her boyfriend.  Alas, not every movie can nail all accounts.  That is what I loved so much about `The Kids Are All Right', a film that understood how to make every facet of that family feel alive and real.  `High Art' delivers to us Lucy Berliner, and forgets about everyone else.At least Lucy Berliner astonishes enough to carry this film.I'd give this film a solid B.",4,The high price of `art'...,1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,4117,"['Having', 'recently', 'seen', 'Kids', 'Are', 'All', 'Right', ""'d"", 'never', 'have', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'same', 'person', 'Aside', 'obvious', 'similarity', 'films', 'center', 'lesbians', 'films', 'are', 'drastically', 'different', 'tone', 'yet', 'contextual', 'assimilation', 'very', 'tune', 'other', 'films', 'tap', 'something', 'human', 'individual', 'revolving', 'relationships', 'shape', 'out', 'due', 'outside', 'forces', 'feel', 'light', 'comedic', 'tones', 'fluttered', 'Kids', 'Are', 'All', 'Right', 'helped', 'propel', 'excellent', 'movie', 'apposed', 'good', 'one', 'denying', 'High', 'Art', 'very', 'very', 'good.The', 'film', 'strangely', 'intoxicating', 'affair', 'young', 'magazine', 'editor', 'former', 'photographer', 'trying', 'draw', 'back', 'out', 'limelight.Lucy', 'Berliner', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'way', 'top', 'Her', 'work', 'photographically', 'was', 'astonishing', 'price', 'fame', 'conformism', 'was', 'something', 'Lucy', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'disappeared', 'Years', 'later', 'not', 'outlandish', 'outgoing', 'manner', 'Holed', 'up', 'crummy', 'apartment', 'heroine', 'addicted', 'girlfriend', 'Lucy', 'drawn', 'back', 'world', 'photography', 'neighbor', 'pretty', 'ambitious', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Syd', 'Syd', 'chance', 'encounter', 'Lucy', 'work', 'unaware', 'past', 'Working', 'magazine', 'Frame', 'photographers', 'Syd', 'Lucy', 'meet', 'too', 'eager', 'bosses', 'pitch', 'idea', 'doing', 'cover', 'piece', 'magazine', 'agreement', 'certain', 'terms', 'price', 'pay', 'women', 'exploit', 'one', 'own', 'benefits', 'only', 'fall', 'deeply', 'love', 'suffer', 'serious', 'loss', 'account', 'films', 'tone', 'very', 'gritty', 'dark', 'well', 'film', 'themes', 'must', 'admit', 'film', 'layers', 'do', ""n't"", 'wear', 'as', 'strongly', 'wanted', 'too', 'performances', 'are', 'severely', 'uneven', 'script', ""n't"", 'dig', 'down', 'deep', 'enough', 'validate', 'character', 'arcs', 'intent', 'one', 'particular', 'purpose', 'pander', 'Lucy', 'emotional', 'lapses', 'add', 'needed', 'depth', 'world', 'Lucy.Benefiting', 'script', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'who', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'female', 'performance', '90', 'contending', 'single', 'handedly', 'other', 'lesbian', 'performance', 'given', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'way', 'playfully', 'audience', 'Lucy', 'remaining', 'mysteriously', 'guarded', 'obviously', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'fantastic', 'body', 'language', 'unnerving', 'remember', 'feeling', 'similar', 'actress', 'Kristen', 'Scott-Thomas', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'hold', 'remarkably', 'natural', 'positions', 'convey', 'so', 'much', 'viewer', 'Just', 'watching', 'Sheedy', 'stand', 'doorway', 'was', 'astonishingly', 'moving.The', 'rest', 'performances', 'suffer.Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'actress', 'normally', 'find', 'flawless', 'way', 'strangely', 'constructed', 'Marlena', 'Dietrick', 'impersonation', 'painful', 'times', 'watch', 'be', 'honest', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'better', 'career', 'somewhat', 'vacant', 'here', 'understand', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'intentional', 'allowing', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'play', 'Mitchell', 'emotional', 'void', 'projecting', 'own', 'substancially', 'heavier', 'persona', 'end', 'just', 'made', 'Syd', 'appear', 'one-dimentional', 'moments', 'moments', 'shines', 'when', 'cover', 'shot', 'taken', 'can', 'read', 'lot', 'blank', 'stare', 'moments', 'are', 'overshadowed', 'bulk', 'performance', 'rest', 'cast', 'honestly', 'not', 'worth', 'mentioning.I', 'wish', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'had', 'been', 'placed', 'fleshing', 'out', 'entirety', 'situation', 'especially', 'dynamic', 'Syd', 'sudden', 'curiosity', 'same', 'sex', 'including', 'disintegrating', 'relationship', 'boyfriend', 'Alas', 'not', 'movie', 'can', 'nail', 'accounts', 'what', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'Kids', 'Are', 'All', 'Right', 'film', 'understood', 'how', 'make', 'facet', 'family', 'feel', 'alive', 'real', 'High', 'Art', 'delivers', 'Lucy', 'Berliner', 'forgets', 'everyone', 'else.At', 'least', 'Lucy', 'Berliner', 'enough', 'carry', 'film.I', ""'d"", 'give', 'film', 'solid', 'B']",High Art

This film is A R T.  Can't have anybody getting better in the end or getting it together!Second, other than the main character dying (off stage of course, we can't have her die on stage, that would be melodrama)--other than that, in order for it to be A R T, nothing has to happen for the entire film.  This film is A R T.It's challenging to make a film in which nothing happens, and Art-filmmaker wannabes work hard at it.  This one takes a more direct approach.  She has people sitting around taking drugs for 90 out of 94 minutes and mumbling incoherently.  How many different ways can you take drugs and stumble around and mumble?Third, throw in background music that is also A R T--no, don't get me wrong!  Not classical music!  That isn't A R T !!!  This one makes sure you get that it's A R T by putting a loud high-pitched hum on the soundtrack for the first five minutes.  A R T -- get it?Fourth, to make sure nobody is tempted to do some independent thinking, drop some names--Barthes, Derrida, etc.--that'll intimidate anybody.And show some boring photographs and DARE anyone to say they're boring.Oh, and that R rating?  And the nudity?  Gonzo!  This film is PG.  Or maybe PG-13 because of all the drug use.In short, this film has absolutely nothing going for it.

515053,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00002JWZT,Dennis Littrell,"[37, 43]","Just kidding.  Actually this is very good film whose only fault is a tendency to take itself a little too seriously at times.Ally Sheedy plays Lucy, a lesbian photographer with a serious drug problem, but an even  more serious inability to cope with the rapacious New York City commercial  art scene.  Lucy struts and poses her cocaine-trim limbs while her mind  stoops to degeneracy.  She is controlled by the deep-throated German  has-been actress, Greta (Patricia Clarkson) her long-time lover, and by her  own falling-down habits.  The mercantile world is too much for her pure  artist's nature, and so she forsakes it for the haze...Radha Mitchell  plays Syd, an assistant editor at Frame, a glitzy photo art mag, who is  seduced by Lucy and by her own need to succeed.  Gabriel Mann plays James,  her boyfriend, who can see the handwriting on the wall, and  splits.Sheedy is outstanding and Mitchell is very good, but what makes  this an intriguing and worth-while film is the uncompromising eye of  Director Lisa Cholodenko, who depicts the sad, dreary NYC ""high art"" drug  scene without a trace of sentimentality or any hidden sexist agenda.  True,  the women in the film are vastly more interesting than the men, who are  merely passive appendages, of little notice.  But that is because those in  focus-Lucy, Syd and Greta-are strong people who shape their own lives, for  better or for worse.  Notice that the hangers-on, on the couch, male or  female, are shallow and empty regardless of sex.The lesbian sexuality  displayed seemed authentic but somehow limited-although, how would I know?  Maybe it's the code.  The dependency passing for love between Lucy and  Greta also struck me as real.  Syd's loss of innocence was the main point,  however, and it was not her sexual seduction that did it, but her discovery  of her own very complex nature.  The look on the face of the receptionist  reading Dostoyevski after Syd appeared on the cover of the magazine, her  hungry interest and then Syd's realization of being looked at in a  different way, was just a marvelous piece of cinema incisively rendered.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""",5,Lesbo druggies exposed!,963273600,"07 11, 2000",2000,2215,"['Just', 'kidding', 'Actually', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'only', 'fault', 'tendency', 'take', 'little', 'too', 'seriously', 'times.Ally', 'Sheedy', 'Lucy', 'lesbian', 'photographer', 'serious', 'drug', 'problem', 'even', 'more', 'serious', 'inability', 'cope', 'rapacious', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'commercial', 'art', 'scene', 'Lucy', 'struts', 'cocaine-trim', 'limbs', 'mind', 'stoops', 'degeneracy', 'controlled', 'deep-throated', 'German', 'has-been', 'actress', 'Greta', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'long-time', 'lover', 'own', 'falling-down', 'habits', 'mercantile', 'world', 'too', 'much', 'pure', 'artist', 'nature', 'so', 'haze', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Syd', 'assistant', 'editor', 'Frame', 'glitzy', 'photo', 'art', 'mag', 'who', 'seduced', 'Lucy', 'own', 'need', 'succeed', 'Gabriel', 'Mann', 'James', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'handwriting', 'wall', 'splits.Sheedy', 'outstanding', 'Mitchell', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'intriguing', 'worth-while', 'film', 'uncompromising', 'eye', 'Director', 'Lisa', 'Cholodenko', 'who', 'sad', 'dreary', 'NYC', 'high', 'art', 'drug', 'scene', 'trace', 'sentimentality', 'hidden', 'sexist', 'agenda', 'True', 'women', 'film', 'are', 'vastly', 'more', 'interesting', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'merely', 'passive', 'appendages', 'little', 'notice', 'focus-Lucy', 'Syd', 'Greta-are', 'strong', 'people', 'who', 'shape', 'own', 'lives', 'better', 'worse', 'Notice', 'hangers-on', 'couch', 'male', 'female', 'are', 'shallow', 'empty', 'regardless', 'sex.The', 'lesbian', 'sexuality', 'displayed', 'seemed', 'authentic', 'somehow', 'limited-although', 'how', 'would', 'know', 'Maybe', 'code', 'dependency', 'passing', 'love', 'Lucy', 'Greta', 'also', 'struck', 'real', 'Syd', 'loss', 'innocence', 'was', 'main', 'point', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'sexual', 'seduction', 'did', 'discovery', 'own', 'very', 'complex', 'nature', 'look', 'face', 'receptionist', 'reading', 'Dostoyevski', 'Syd', 'appeared', 'cover', 'magazine', 'hungry', 'interest', 'then', 'Syd', 'realization', 'being', 'looked', 'different', 'way', 'was', 'just', 'marvelous', 'piece', 'cinema', 'incisively', 'Dennis', 'Littrell', 'author', 'Cut', 'Chaise', 'Lounge', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Swallowed', 'Remote']",High Art

Although the characters certainly have a palpable attraction, and the storyline is tragic, not much stands out in this film for me. The tragedy of Lucy's character's failing to grasp herself before she succumbs to her own weakness for the life she's known for the last few years, is probably the most rattling aspect of this film. As for the chemistry between the characters throughout the film, and the sexual scenes, they were a bit contrived. As a lesbian myself, I was disappointed that they were not more believable, as there are not many films that capture true attraction emotionally and physically, effectively, as it is.

It's also a very perceptive and accurate look at the NYC art scene, where both artists and the editors who help ""make"" them can often be random nobodies who through sheer determination, obsession, and/or ruthlessness climb and claw their way to the top of their respective careers.The title, ""High Art"" is actually more self-ironic than pretentious: this film cleanly tears back the pretentious facade not only of the art world, but of human relationships in general.  When are we not using each other, consciously or unconsciously, each for his/her own reasons which might well be hidden to themselves?The ending is a little abrupt, but courageous in its refusal to stoop to cheap sentimentality and its preservation of the basic UNKNOWABILITY at the core of every relationship and every person...in this case, the weeping Radha Mitchell.  For whom are her tears?  We don't really know, and that's exactly where it needed to be left.I'd definitely include this in my ""worth-owning"" list.

515057,A9HKBYQB4XIEV,B00002JWZT,"""eurotrashgirl""","[7, 8]","High Art has got to be one of the best films I've seen, at least in a long, long while. I say that because it is so finely paced, so intricate in its rhythms and moods, that it has the quality of real life, or perhaps more aptly, a real dream. Between the music and the color of the sets, and the relaxed, subtle acting which fits right in with both, Cholodenko creates a world apart, and the viewer is drawn in like a lover in an entryway.High Art tells the story of an aspiring assistant editor at a photography magazine who by chance meets a brilliant photographer (Lucy), who, after much acclaim years earlier, has stopped being active in her art. The editor, Syd, is entranced by Lucy's nonchalant affect, the aura of her apartment, the steady stream of friends coming in and out, and most importantly, her photography. In turn, Lucy is attracted to Syd for her drive, her ambition, and her uncharted youth. Their mutual attraction rocks the drug-filled boat that is Lucy's flat, and a new love, and a resurgence of Lucy's art, is born. Whether they are allowed to thrive is up to Lucy, her long-time lover Greta, and all the other hangers-on.The characters here don't feel like characters so much as real people who can make mistakes, who can try starting over, but who might have to deal with fate, (not to mention old habits and barely functioning relationships), along the way.Ally Sheedy's performance here is truly amazing, mainly because it ends up not feeling like a performance at all. She plays each emotion with subtlety and depth and her timing and moods are right on the money, time after time. Rhada Mitchell is right there with her, giving a deeply moving performance as the young woman who sheds light on the shadowed Lucy only to question her reasons for doing so.Gabriel Mann makes a welcome appearance as Syd's boyfriend, James. His James is the right mix of attractive, caring boyfriend, yet somehow dimmer counterpart to the magnetic Lucy. He may love Syd, but he can live without her. Lucy's pull is stronger, she needs Syd more. And the love she offers is real.I give this movie five stars. Does well with multiple viewings, so a good one to own.

It was so obvious that men who had always wanted control it for the interest of themselves.  We need to let the entire society including children to understand this important issue as well.I definitely have enjoyed and praise director's character focused cinematography. enabled by excellent acting skills of the two captivating casts portraying honest sense of humanity. I am strongly hoping that blessing days to come really soon for women lovers where they do not have to use drug or alcohol to cope with the still occasionally cruel world.  It made me so sad that Lucy died before the two women to have chance to enjoy the rewards of their work. However at least I felt better that there were no scene of violence nor intimidation against women loversThe time has come for women to re-evaluate the societal concept of women's place for their own good, success and happiness. There are many areas women can perform significantly better than men including Art and Science.  It  is unfortunate that men has denied women to explore their potentials and opportunities all the way along until just recently.  It is not nothing wrong for some women to totally ignore men  and find their potential of their own amongst the exclusively own sex considering never-ending societal prejudice against them.Women were shut out from opportunity to explore intellectual world.  It is highly likely all men were fearful of women's innate social skill embedded in their gene from our mammal ancestors. Prehistoric men have already witnessed the intensity and wisdom of communal love between female lions. Hence cultural segregation between sex began arising out from intrinsic fear present in men's psyche particularly amongst those uneducated and ignorant of humanity.It is not accurate to say that homosexuality has been forbidden in most of cultures amongst Eurasian continent.  In the beginning of Etruscan and Chinese civilisation, women were often valued less than a household animal.  Hence women never even had their right of their own to love who they desired  It was particularly true in ancient Chinese Empire. When a woman was found next to any man of high birth, She was immediately beheaded accused of being a parasite or vermin and replaced by a catamite.  That inhuman mentality still seems to be intact with some Asian men's mind. Fortunately the replacing women with catamites did not occur in Japan, but all Japanese have committed similar crimes down the history during the mediaeval age discarding new born female infants in favour of male infants. Truth is that privileged men exercised homosexuality rather openly but women never had enough rights of exercising no matter what they preferred to do. Israel and China both have a long history of Phallocentric homosexuality goes back about to 2000BC and 1600BC respectively In fact they do have a long history of homosexuality following NearEast, Greece, Middle East, and India.  I believe that the tradition spreadded via Silk Road from Etruria (ancient Tuscany) branched off to Israel and Egypt. then to Sparta, then Turk, then India and to China. However, those were Phallocentric homosexuality including most distasteful and bizarre catamites.  In contrast to contiguous Eurasian continent, Japan has had long history of Parthenocentric homosexuality amongst noble born court attendants and they developed highly intellectual feminist scholar of their own. Contrarily to common beliefs, before the paternalistic authoritarianism ever had any chance to come in effect in Japan, there were  four contiguous centuries, a long historic period called the He An Era (794 - 1185 A.D. meaning the time for peace and tranquility) where contemporary feminist scholars including art, poetry, and literature flourished in Japanese Imperial Court. It is often considered the peak of the Japanese civilization. I personally view societal harm from Phallocentric homosexuality is so disastrous beyond comparison with Parthenocentric homosexuality. Unfortunately Chinese men usually do not wish to give a same degree of freedom nor intellectual opportunities to women.

515064,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00002JWZT,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 12]","The trailer for &quot;High Art&quot; says this 1998 film from writer-director Lisa Cholodenko is about &quot;ambition, seduction, sacrifice and other career moves,&quot; which is a particularly bad way to sell the film. Syd (Radha Mitchell) has just been made an associate editor at a New York photo magazine, although it is not clear why she got the job let alone whether the title means anything more than glorified intern. One night she is taking a bath when she notices water is coming through her ceiling. She goes upstairs and knocks on the door of the apartment above the one she shares with her boyfriend, James (Gabriel Mann), and enters a whole new world.The apartment belongs to Lucy Berliner (Ally Sheedy) and the place is basically a heroin den. The walls are covered with photographs and eventually we learn that Lucy was once a well-known photographer. But now her life is an endless circle of drugs, love making with her lover, Greta (Patricia Clarkson), and fairly brutal visits with her mother (Tammy Grimes). The photographs all speak to Lucy's obsession with Greta, a former German actress who made films with Fassbinder, and who is so out of it she falls asleep all the time, not only in restaurants but in the middle of Lucy making love to her. Syd thinks that Lucy's photographs might help her make a name for herself at her magazine, and she has no idea how right she is when she brings in a book of Lucy's photographs to her boss (David Thornton) and the magazine's editor (Anh Duong).Lucy agrees, but with the stipulation that Syd will be her editor and it becomes clear that the older photographer is considering the young wannabe editor as new muse. While Lucy's motivations are clear, Syd's are a jumbled confusion of personal and professional feelings. Is she exploring her sexuality with Lucy or exploiting it to get ahead at work? But then we understand that Syd is not simply a new plaything for Lucy, but a chance to abandon the lethargy of her existence and start living again, which only serves to up the ante of their encounters. The problem is that Greta is bound to her life in so many ways that this is a risky proposition at best and if the situations depicted are beyond our reality the ending of this film is not.Sheedy and Mitchell provided solid performances as the key players, with Clarkson underplaying the human sinkhole that is Greta's heroin addict. However, this is a sense of detachment in the film because of Cholodenko's decision to do the sex scenes without graphic nudity. In fact, most of the love scenes involve the characters keeping their clothes on to the point that the line the director has drawn for her actresses becomes obvious and something of a distraction. This is not to say that nudity is necessary for sensuality to be portrayed on screen, but simply that avoiding it so rigorously works against those scenes in &quot;High Art.&quot;",4,Sometimes opportunity knocks on the door both ways,1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,2906,"['trailer', 'quot', 'High', 'Art', 'quot', '1998', 'film', 'writer-director', 'Lisa', 'Cholodenko', 'quot', 'ambition', 'seduction', 'sacrifice', 'other', 'career', 'moves', 'quot', 'particularly', 'bad', 'way', 'sell', 'film', 'Syd', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'just', 'been', 'made', 'associate', 'editor', 'New', 'York', 'photo', 'magazine', 'not', 'clear', 'why', 'got', 'job', 'let', 'alone', 'title', 'anything', 'more', 'glorified', 'intern', 'One', 'night', 'taking', 'bath', 'when', 'water', 'coming', 'ceiling', 'upstairs', 'knocks', 'door', 'apartment', 'one', 'shares', 'boyfriend', 'James', 'Gabriel', 'Mann', 'whole', 'new', 'world.The', 'apartment', 'belongs', 'Lucy', 'Berliner', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'place', 'basically', 'heroin', 'den', 'walls', 'are', 'covered', 'photographs', 'eventually', 'learn', 'Lucy', 'was', 'once', 'well-known', 'photographer', 'now', 'life', 'endless', 'circle', 'drugs', 'love', 'making', 'lover', 'Greta', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'fairly', 'brutal', 'visits', 'mother', 'Tammy', 'Grimes', 'photographs', 'speak', 'Lucy', 'obsession', 'Greta', 'former', 'German', 'actress', 'who', 'made', 'films', 'Fassbinder', 'who', 'so', 'asleep', 'time', 'not', 'only', 'restaurants', 'middle', 'Lucy', 'making', 'love', 'Syd', 'Lucy', 'photographs', 'might', 'help', 'make', 'name', 'herself', 'magazine', 'idea', 'how', 'right', 'when', 'book', 'Lucy', 'photographs', 'boss', 'David', 'Thornton', 'magazine', 'editor', 'Anh', 'Duong', '.Lucy', 'stipulation', 'Syd', 'will', 'be', 'editor', 'clear', 'older', 'photographer', 'considering', 'young', 'wannabe', 'editor', 'new', 'muse', 'Lucy', 'motivations', 'are', 'clear', 'Syd', 'are', 'jumbled', 'confusion', 'personal', 'professional', 'feelings', 'exploring', 'sexuality', 'Lucy', 'exploiting', 'get', 'ahead', 'work', 'then', 'understand', 'Syd', 'not', 'simply', 'new', 'plaything', 'Lucy', 'chance', 'abandon', 'lethargy', 'existence', 'start', 'living', 'again', 'only', 'up', 'ante', 'encounters', 'problem', 'Greta', 'bound', 'life', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'risky', 'proposition', 'best', 'situations', 'depicted', 'are', 'reality', 'ending', 'film', 'not.Sheedy', 'Mitchell', 'provided', 'solid', 'performances', 'key', 'players', 'Clarkson', 'underplaying', 'human', 'sinkhole', 'Greta', 'heroin', 'addict', 'However', 'sense', 'detachment', 'film', 'Cholodenko', 'decision', 'do', 'sex', 'scenes', 'graphic', 'nudity', 'fact', 'most', 'love', 'scenes', 'involve', 'characters', 'keeping', 'clothes', 'point', 'line', 'director', 'drawn', 'actresses', 'obvious', 'something', 'distraction', 'not', 'say', 'nudity', 'necessary', 'sensuality', 'be', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'simply', 'avoiding', 'so', 'rigorously', 'scenes', 'quot', 'High', 'Art.', 'quot']",High Art
515065,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00002JWZT,Linda Linguvic,"[54, 63]","I guess I've been culturally deprived.  I never heard of Ally Sheedy before. I understand she was once part of a brat pack and did very different roles than this, but I have no other frame of reference.  Anyway, in this ambitious modern tale, she plays the part of a lesbian photographer who's into drugs.  She lives with her heroin-addicted girlfriend and has prematurely given up a promising career.  They hang out in their seedy apartment doing drugs with a variety of other people and that seems to be the sum total of their lives.  In the apartment below lives a young professional woman, Radha Mitchell, and her boyfriend.  When there is a leak from the apartment above, the young woman goes upstairs and meets the photographer and her assorted friends. She works as an assistant editor for a photography magazine and is immediately drawn into the art of the photos as well as an attraction for Ally Sheedy and drugs.One of the things I liked most about this video is what I thought of as its authenticity.  There are several sex scenes that have the feel of real people in bed.  If anything, they were so real that they went on a little too long but the reality of attraction, shyness, conversation, and exploration deepened the characterizations of the people involved.  Perhaps this is the intention of the screenwriter, the long and lingering views of the relationship.  There were also long and lingering views of drug taking and again I felt they were a little too much.  The film though seemed to be trying to be an art form in itself and although the two star's performances were excellent, some of the minor characters just didn't quite seem real, such as Ally Sheedy's mother or the druggie girlfriend.  The mood of the video is melancholy, the pace slow, the acting uneven.

I am so glad I had no preconceived notions about what I was about to see.  Ally Sheedy gives the performance of her career as Lucy, a drug addicted, semi-retired photographer who shows no willingness to stop her self destructive behavior. Aided by her equally strung out German lover, wonderfully portrayed by Patricia Clarkson, this is one romantic pairing that personifies loathing and apathy like nothing else on screen.Radha Mitchell gives a very worthy performance as the youthfully naive Syd, an editorial assistant at a pretentious art magazine who takes on the task of pulling Lucy out of her stupor and back into the high stakes art world she left behind.  In the process, she becomes mesmerized with the reclusive photographer and is drawn into Lucy's world of alcohol and cocaine.Lisa Cholodenko portrays the dark underside of the art world and the elusive nature of human relationships with a wonderful eye for detail.  This is definitely not an upbeat film and Cholodenko refuses to glamorize the self destructive behavior that exists throughout.  She is, however, able to bring out the best performances in her actors and is thus able to deliver a powerhouse of a film that will stay with you well after it is over.",4,...a powerhouse of a film...,981244800,"02 4, 2001",2001,1298,"['rented', 'High', 'Art', 'not', 'really', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'film', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'had', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'see', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'performance', 'career', 'Lucy', 'drug', 'addicted', 'semi-retired', 'photographer', 'who', 'willingness', 'stop', 'self', 'destructive', 'behavior', 'Aided', 'equally', 'out', 'German', 'lover', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'one', 'romantic', 'pairing', 'loathing', 'apathy', 'nothing', 'else', 'screen.Radha', 'Mitchell', 'very', 'worthy', 'performance', 'youthfully', 'naive', 'Syd', 'editorial', 'assistant', 'pretentious', 'art', 'magazine', 'who', 'task', 'pulling', 'Lucy', 'stupor', 'back', 'high', 'stakes', 'art', 'world', 'left', 'behind', 'process', 'mesmerized', 'reclusive', 'photographer', 'drawn', 'Lucy', 'world', 'alcohol', 'cocaine.Lisa', 'Cholodenko', 'dark', 'underside', 'art', 'world', 'elusive', 'nature', 'human', 'relationships', 'wonderful', 'eye', 'detail', 'definitely', 'not', 'upbeat', 'film', 'Cholodenko', 'glamorize', 'self', 'destructive', 'behavior', 'however', 'able', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'performances', 'actors', 'thus', 'able', 'deliver', 'powerhouse', 'film', 'will', 'stay', 'well']",High Art

It combines the complex struggle for critical achievement and the allurement  of a naive stairclimber in the ladder of success, the relationship between  the reclusive artisan and the emulous ingenue developing into something  more than the beauty of their love and the complications it instigates in  those around them.Syd, a young assistant editor for a photography  magazine, discovers one night that an artistic genius lives upstairs from  her after fixing a leak in her bathroom. She examines her work exhibited  all over the walls of her apartment and persuades her fellow co-workers to  display her neighbor's creations in Frame (the magazine). She soons finds  out that her newly acquainted tenant is a reknowned photographer named Lucy  Berliner, a lesbian freelancer who has done nothing but avoid the limelight  for the past few years. Syd doggedly entreats Lucy to consider a return to  the business and soon finds herself in the tornado of Lucy's wild and  self-destructive lifestyle.Her drug-addicted friends and melodramatic  lover Greta are the poison of Lucy's private society, a group of people who  freely associate with each other sexually and socially. Lucy is their  sovereign and they are conveniently her muses for her craft. Syd wets her  feet in Lucy's strange circle of companions and in turn develops an  intimate knowledge of Lucy's quirks and methods for inspiration, becoming  her confidant and ultimately her lover.Both leads are portrayed with  indefectible representation by Radha Mitchell (Syd) and the intriguing,  poignant comeback performance of the one-and-only Breakfast Club alumni,  Ally Sheedy. Radha is hypnotizing but endearing and Sheedy is raw and  sincere. Both tend to compliment the other whenever they are together,  their portrayal of the other's affections plausible and tender.Who  really turns up the action in this film is Patricia Clarkson, the eccentric  and egotistical Greta Krauss, an actress  and former lover who thrives off  the attentions of Lucy's affections and who ultimately becomes the thorn in  her side.This was very well directed, and independent films are usually  the gems of the movie industry because they are not under the thumb of  critical and financial stress while being produced. This story is  heart-breaking but nonetheless mesmerizing, and I have to say that although  most people might find this film a little somnolent, I think it displays a  lot of unmarked talent and discerning screen-writing for avoiding the  overly-romantic passions that most movies like to dish out. This movie is  not about romance. It is about the unfettered and unrefined courses that  real relationships have, and a respectful depiction of lesbianic relations.If you're looking to add an unusual and memorable piece to your movie  athenaeum, then I beg you to consider High Art.
