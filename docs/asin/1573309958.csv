All that hopping and jumping on your toes. And I didn't even use the rope!If you are beginning this workout, please take it slow! This is not a novice's regimen. If you do this a few times, you will discover a whole new respect for the sport of boxing. The amount of coordination, focus, cardio strength, and agility you require to engage in a boxing practice totally took me by surprise.It is true that Kathy Smith doesn't appear in the final segement and makes a couple mistakes. And I, too, like some other reviewers, initially felt let down by her because of this. After all, if she can't even do it....however, after merely attempting to use the jump rope for a few jumps, I can see that even tip top shapers like Kathy Smith would find if challenging to flawlessly continue on with a program like this unless they had trained for years and years professionally.It's a great workout if you want to push your limits.

That alone makes it interesting to me.  Michael Olajide Jr. leads most of the workout and he is a fun instructor, does a good job of cuing and motivating (is nice to look at!).  None of Kathy's usual bevy of back up leaders are present, and quite frankly I wouldn't have wanted to train for this either (I can't get through the thing once yet without a quick march in place or two, much less as many times as segments may be repeated during a shoot.).  Kathy herself is actually not present for the final jump rope challenge.The punch sequences are kind of lackluster compared to Kathy Smith's Kickboxing workout, but as stated above, the killer part of this workout is the jump roping. That's right - jump rope, and we are not talking double dutch -- we are talking Muhammad Ali! I consider myself in pretty good shape and I was so beaten by these that I would have to stop before the segments were over and just march in place/stretch out my calves and I wasn't even using the jump rope yet!

188838,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,1573309958,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[2, 2]","Aerobox is a tough boxing working combined with jump rope drills to up the intensity even further. Although it is designated as a Kathy Smith workout, the workout is actually led by Michael Olajide, a boxer, with Kathy offering only occasional form pointers and encouragement. Prior to the start of the workout, Kathy and Michael review the moves which will be used during the routine and discuss proper form. In addition to Michael and Kathy, there are 3 other background exercisers.The workout begins with a warmup lasting just over 7 minutes. In this section, you will perform simple punches combined with side steps and plenty of twists to begin raising the heart rate; the warmup ends with some basic upper and lower body stretches. The next section, standing boxing, is the longest segment at 11 minutes. You will begin concentrating more intensly on the punches here, as Michael introduces some double-time moves. Following this comes ""Stick and Move 1,"" a 4-minute segment which adds some simple footwork--mostly via boxer's shuffles--to the boxing movements. Although this increases the impact, you could easily modify to keep the workout low-impact (but certainly not low intensity!).Next comes the first jumprope segment, which lasts 4 minutes. One of the background exercisers does not use the jump rope, and I found it difficult to even imagine being able to keep up with the footwork while using an actual jump rope. Furthermore, even without the jump rope, I felt like I was working pretty hard during these segments. A second ""Stick and Move"" section follows, this one only 2 minutes but with some quicker footwork. The next jumprope segment last 5 minutes, with the moves becoming a bit more complex. The final ""Stick and Move"" section is also only 2 minutes and again involves quick footwork. The final jumprope section is performed by only Michael and two of the background exercisers--it seemed like the others, including Kathy, were having trouble keeping up! This 4-minute segment ups the intensity and impact even further by adding some jogging a knee raises.At this point, the workout begins to wind down. First there is an ""Aerobic Cool-Down"" during which you are still doing punches and some footwork, but at a much slower pace. Next comes 4 minutes of simple stretches, repeating some of the same exercises from the warmup. The total workout time is 50 minutes, but if you watch the video beyond this point, you will see Kathy and the other exercisers goofing around with Michael, as they are all wearing eye patches to match him. I thought Michael instructed very well; he seemed to have some experience in this area, as he offered flawless mirrored cueing and usually did a good job of cueing any movement changes. Kathy herself was a bit annoying at times, but this was tolerable given that she did not lead the workout. Overall, this was an intense aerobic workout which would be perfect for experienced exercisers looking for something new to add to their routine.",4,A tough boxing workout which includes jump rope drills,1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,2996,"['Aerobox', 'tough', 'boxing', 'working', 'combined', 'jump', 'rope', 'drills', 'intensity', 'even', 'further', 'designated', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'workout', 'workout', 'actually', 'led', 'Michael', 'Olajide', 'boxer', 'Kathy', 'offering', 'only', 'occasional', 'form', 'pointers', 'encouragement', 'Prior', 'start', 'workout', 'Kathy', 'Michael', 'review', 'moves', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'routine', 'discuss', 'proper', 'form', 'addition', 'Michael', 'Kathy', 'are', '3', 'other', 'background', 'workout', 'warmup', 'lasting', 'just', '7', 'minutes', 'section', 'will', 'perform', 'simple', 'punches', 'combined', 'side', 'steps', 'plenty', 'twists', 'begin', 'raising', 'heart', 'rate', 'warmup', 'basic', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'stretches', 'next', 'section', 'standing', 'boxing', 'longest', 'segment', '11', 'minutes', 'will', 'begin', 'concentrating', 'more', 'intensly', 'punches', 'here', 'Michael', 'double-time', 'moves', 'Following', 'Stick', 'Move', '1', '4-minute', 'segment', 'simple', 'footwork', 'mostly', 'boxer', 'shuffles', 'boxing', 'movements', 'impact', 'could', 'easily', 'modify', 'keep', 'workout', 'low-impact', 'certainly', 'not', 'low', 'intensity', '.Next', 'first', 'jumprope', 'segment', '4', 'minutes', 'One', 'background', 'exercisers', 'not', 'use', 'jump', 'rope', 'found', 'difficult', 'even', 'imagine', 'being', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'footwork', 'using', 'actual', 'jump', 'rope', 'Furthermore', 'even', 'jump', 'rope', 'felt', 'was', 'working', 'pretty', 'hard', 'segments', 'second', 'Stick', 'Move', 'section', 'one', 'only', '2', 'minutes', 'quicker', 'footwork', 'next', 'jumprope', 'segment', 'last', '5', 'minutes', 'moves', 'becoming', 'bit', 'more', 'complex', 'final', 'Stick', 'Move', 'section', 'also', 'only', '2', 'minutes', 'again', 'involves', 'quick', 'footwork', 'final', 'jumprope', 'section', 'performed', 'only', 'Michael', 'two', 'background', 'exercisers', 'seemed', 'others', 'including', 'Kathy', 'were', 'having', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'up', '4-minute', 'segment', 'intensity', 'impact', 'even', 'further', 'adding', 'jogging', 'knee', 'raises.At', 'point', 'workout', 'wind', 'down', 'First', 'Aerobic', 'Cool-Down', 'are', 'still', 'doing', 'punches', 'footwork', 'much', 'slower', 'pace', 'Next', '4', 'minutes', 'simple', 'stretches', 'repeating', 'same', 'exercises', 'warmup', 'total', 'workout', 'time', '50', 'minutes', 'watch', 'video', 'point', 'will', 'see', 'Kathy', 'other', 'exercisers', 'goofing', 'Michael', 'are', 'wearing', 'eye', 'patches', 'match', 'thought', 'Michael', 'instructed', 'very', 'well', 'seemed', 'have', 'experience', 'area', 'offered', 'flawless', 'mirrored', 'cueing', 'usually', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'cueing', 'movement', 'changes', 'Kathy', 'was', 'bit', 'annoying', 'times', 'was', 'tolerable', 'given', 'did', 'not', 'lead', 'workout', 'Overall', 'was', 'intense', 'aerobic', 'workout', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'experienced', 'exercisers', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'add', 'routine']",N/A

188840,A2TMQJD6VMSFHM,1573309958,"Kat Ramone ""katramone""","[2, 2]","The initial reviews for this Aerobox video are right on.  The release date noted is ""1998,"" but my VHS tape states ""1994"" as the (probable) filming of this workout, and it shows...it is a bit dated (somewhat 80's techno-style music and pyro effects!), but the workout itself is tough and timeless!  As I have mentioned before in several reviews, I am intermediate in aerobics, and not a great fan of high impact.  If I do high impact, I can rarely complete twenty minutes; lower impact I can endure a bit longer.  For this video (I have the VHS, not DVD), I would recommend that beginners take it easy, and perhaps forego the jump rope segments until one is conditioned.  Even intermediate aerobic levels may have to go easy as well...I know I did!  I could barely get through the jump roping segments; there are three, and I made it through two, although I had to alternate between using the jump rope and optional no rope...the moves were high impact, there are several jump rope/foot patterns, and my legs were like jelly when I finally had to stop!  Also, I was doing straight jumping because the foot patterns AND jumping were just too much!  At least this provides room to improve!  Kathy basically has Michael Olajide, JR. instruct the workout, which is great because Kathy really looks a bit out of shape and is somewhat clumsy with the moves. While he mentions over and over ""not to let your feet come together,"" there's Kathy, moving side-to-side putting her feet together.  When M.O. says, ""don't let the elbows go to the back,"" again, there's Kathy with her elbows flinging around from the back.  At least she's trying...thank gosh she's not instructing!The workout takes place in a boxing-type ring, with a line of others working out, and one individual following along without the rope during the jump rope segment (thank gosh!).  There is a pretty good warm-up stretch segment, plenty of ""boxer"" moves working the arms and legs:  upper cuts, hooks, straight punches; shuffles, sticking, foot pattern movements coordinated with boxing punches, which one would expect in a ""boxing"" workout.  Olajide works out hard, as does the rest of the gang, and as said, it is a reasonbly tough workout.  If one is in tip-top shape, already boxes, and is advanced, perhaps this workout might be boring or easy; however, for the beginner and intermediate levels, this workout provides excellent conditioning with room to improve.  Personally, I enjoy Kathy's ""Kickboxing"" workout, the difference between the Kickboxing and the Aeroboxing being that the Kickboxing is a newer edition, and instead of all the footwork/boxing combos, there is obviously more kicking involved.  This is a good video to add to one's aerobic workout library...in my opinion, the jump roping segments are killer, really work the legs and heart and really contribute to the effectiveness of the aerobic effects.  For those of us who recall jump roping during recess in school, well, that was naturally fun.  Now that some of us are older and not as agile and in shape as we once were, the jump roping has become a true aerobic challenge!UPDATE!

You will hardly be able to get out of bed!Aerobox takes place in a boxing ring with Kathy Smith, Boxer Michael Olajide and about 4 more exercisers who are in very good shape! The music is awesome and it will keep you going and make you push yourself. This is mostly led my Michael with Kathy giving tips on posture, helping with the count, etc. You will be doing a lot of boxing training exercises like jabs, upper cuts and hooks while you bounce on your legs and swing side to side so you will be working both your upper and lower body at the same time. This will also work your abs without doing a single crunch. You will definitely feel that burn.After the boxing segment, there is a very intense jumping rope section which doesn't require a jump rope, but if you do decide to use it, it is much more challenging because the rope exercises are very difficult. You will feel your calves burning! At the end, you will cool down and stretch and be glad it's over. But you'll be even happier when you start seeing your body changing, your arms shaping up, your legs trimming and getting really lean and tight overall. If you look at Michael's body, you will understand why he looks the way he looks, he is not bulky, he is very trim, cut, lean and just solid! It's that tough, boxing training... It will get you into shape!Aerobox is a lot of fun, however, it will require a lot of coordination, so beware if you're a bit of a clutz :-)This is a very tough workout, probably best for intermediate and advanced exercisers.
