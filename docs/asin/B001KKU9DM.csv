This movie is what you would call a real laugh out loud till your sides ache comedy!Bernice Mac and Samuel L. Jackson are both ex-soul singers who only put out one record back in the seventies and went their separate ways there after. Due to the death of their previous lead singer they are asked to perform at his funeral and are therefore asked to reunite, even though they are not on the best of terms.Even though I really enjoyed this movie greatly, I must warn everyone there is a considerable amount of adult scenes in the movie and a prolific use of abusive language (m*****f***er) in almost every scene... I think they would have even worked that word into the title if they could!The movie does a great 70's soundtrack which I really enjoyed especially the one when they first hit the road!A great comedy, there is not denying that at all, but it could have done with less obscenity!",5,Bernie Mac Goes Out with His Best Work Ever!,1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,964,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'got', 'be', 'best', 'work', 'ever', 'movie', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'real', 'laugh', 'loud', 'till', 'sides', 'ache', 'comedy', 'Bernice', 'Mac', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'are', 'ex-soul', 'singers', 'who', 'only', 'put', 'out', 'one', 'record', 'back', 'seventies', 'went', 'separate', 'ways', 'there', 'Due', 'death', 'previous', 'lead', 'singer', 'are', 'asked', 'perform', 'funeral', 'are', 'therefore', 'asked', 'reunite', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'best', 'terms.Even', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'greatly', 'must', 'warn', 'everyone', 'considerable', 'amount', 'adult', 'scenes', 'movie', 'prolific', 'use', 'abusive', 'language', 'm*****f***er', 'almost', 'scene', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'worked', 'word', 'title', 'could', 'movie', 'great', '70', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'especially', 'one', 'when', 'first', 'hit', 'road', 'great', 'comedy', 'not', 'denying', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'less', 'obscenity']",N/A

Floyd pays a visit to Lewis after the death of a soul singer legend Marcus Hooks(played by John Legend) to perform at an event at the Apollo because they believe they can get paid. Lewis is still bitter with Floyd about an incident involving his former wife. They reluctantly team up and go performing state to state before they reach the Apollo.I wont say that I always laughed but there are plenty of times where I laughed especially with the interaction between Bernie Mac's character and Samuel Jackson's character. Cleo's bumbling, abusive boyfriend Lester(Affion Crockett) had some funny moments too. Both Floyd and Lewis's misadventures are humorous also. There are times when i laughed and times where I smiled. Lewis's interaction with Cleo(played by the attractive Sharon Leal who somewhat resembles Kerry Washington) was sweet. The songs Lewis and Floyd sung were cool and they seem to have a ball performing them and not phoning in their performances(like some entertainers tend to do).

1208146,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B001KKU9DM,Stephanie De Pue,"[12, 14]","""Soul Men,"" a 2008 release, is a musical comedy road picture, with a template of sadness behind it.  It stars more frequent action hero, Samuel L. Jackson, and the late Bernie Mac.  It was written by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone, and directed by Malcolm Lee, noted American filmmaker Spike Lee's kid brother.  Jackson plays Louis Hinds; Mac, Floyd Henderson.  Together, they were once ""The Real Deal,"" popular soul singers, and released a single record album.  But it's been decades since they were together.  Then the death of the supposedly legendary Marcus Hooks (John Legend), once their lead singer, gives them a very good reason to reunite:  there's to be a memorial concert at New York's famous Apollo Theater, at which they've been invited to sing.  It might just jump start their fallow singing careers.So, quick as you can say Jackie Robinson, it becomes a road picture, as the quarreling ex-colleagues jump into a Cadillac in California, with four days to reach New York.  There is lots of grumbling and fighting, and, be warned if it bothers you, a great deal of obscene language: with m-----f----- in almost every scene.  Along the road, they will bump up against Rosalee, played by Jennifer Coolidge, in a distasteful sexist interlude that I could have done without.  Also Cleo (Sharon Leal,Dreamgirls), who is supposedly the daughter of one of the leads; they're initially not sure which; Lester (Affion Crockett), Cleo's none too bright, abusive boyfriend; Danny Epstein (Sean Hayes), their new manager, and Philip, (Adam Herschman), Epstein's gofer.  Towards the end of the picture we meet the late great funk/soul musician Isaac Hayes, playing himself.Hayes is very visibly ill and weak - he is used to do little more than walk across the screen.  And I wish the producers had spent more money on the actors playing Philip (Herschman) and Cleo (Leal): they appear in many scenes, and granted, Leal is certainly pretty enough and sings very well; but they don't bring much to the screen.However, the charismatic leads do bring a lot to their parts.  Their comic timing is spot-on; Jackson's a good straight man, yet he can both pitch and catch: go know.  The singing is fine, and the movie boasts a nice sound track of 1970's funk/soul hits.  All in all, it's an enjoyable film. And, while it is the last film appearance of Mac and Hayes, I can recommend it as worth seeing for more than curiosity.  Nevertheless, at film's post script, as the final credits roll, the interviews with Mac and Hayes are likely to bring tears to your eyes: they did to mine.",4,Charismatic Leads Bring A Lot to The Movie,1233619200,"02 3, 2009",2009,2575,"['Soul', 'Men', '2008', 'release', 'musical', 'comedy', 'road', 'picture', 'template', 'sadness', 'more', 'frequent', 'action', 'hero', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'late', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'was', 'written', 'Robert', 'Ramsey', 'Matthew', 'Stone', 'directed', 'Malcolm', 'Lee', 'noted', 'American', 'filmmaker', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'kid', 'brother', 'Jackson', 'Louis', 'Hinds', 'Mac', 'Floyd', 'Henderson', 'Together', 'were', 'once', 'Real', 'Deal', 'popular', 'soul', 'singers', 'released', 'single', 'record', 'album', 'been', 'decades', 'were', 'together', 'Then', 'death', 'supposedly', 'legendary', 'Marcus', 'Hooks', 'John', 'Legend', 'once', 'lead', 'singer', 'very', 'good', 'reason', 'reunite', 'be', 'memorial', 'concert', 'New', 'York', 'famous', 'Apollo', 'Theater', ""'ve"", 'been', 'invited', 'sing', 'might', 'just', 'jump', 'start', 'fallow', 'singing', 'careers.So', 'quick', 'can', 'say', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'road', 'picture', 'quarreling', 'ex-colleagues', 'jump', 'Cadillac', 'California', 'four', 'days', 'reach', 'New', 'York', 'lots', 'grumbling', 'fighting', 'be', 'warned', 'great', 'deal', 'obscene', 'language', 'm', '-f', 'almost', 'scene', 'road', 'will', 'bump', 'up', 'Rosalee', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'distasteful', 'sexist', 'interlude', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Also', 'Cleo', 'Sharon', 'Leal', 'Dreamgirls', 'who', 'supposedly', 'daughter', 'one', 'leads', ""'re"", 'initially', 'not', 'sure', 'Lester', 'Affion', 'Crockett', 'Cleo', 'none', 'too', 'bright', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'Danny', 'Epstein', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'new', 'manager', 'Philip', 'Adam', 'Herschman', 'Epstein', 'gofer', 'end', 'picture', 'meet', 'late', 'great', 'funk/soul', 'musician', 'Isaac', 'Hayes', 'playing', 'himself.Hayes', 'very', 'visibly', 'ill', 'weak', 'used', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'walk', 'screen', 'wish', 'producers', 'had', 'spent', 'more', 'money', 'actors', 'playing', 'Philip', 'Herschman', 'Cleo', 'Leal', 'appear', 'many', 'scenes', 'granted', 'Leal', 'certainly', 'pretty', 'enough', 'sings', 'very', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'bring', 'much', 'screen.However', 'charismatic', 'leads', 'do', 'bring', 'lot', 'parts', 'comic', 'timing', 'spot-on', 'Jackson', 'good', 'straight', 'man', 'yet', 'can', 'both', 'pitch', 'catch', 'go', 'know', 'singing', 'fine', 'movie', 'nice', 'sound', 'track', '1970', 'funk/soul', 'hits', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'last', 'film', 'appearance', 'Mac', 'Hayes', 'can', 'recommend', 'worth', 'seeing', 'more', 'curiosity', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'post', 'script', 'final', 'credits', 'roll', 'interviews', 'Mac', 'Hayes', 'are', 'likely', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'did', 'mine']",N/A
1208147,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B001KKU9DM,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","Soul Men was a film that was racked with problems right from the start. Originally the film kept getting pushed back because of a law suit by the R&B group, Sam & David, which claimed it to be a farce on their life story. The group also accused the producers of copyright infringement for using their style and the title of one of their songs, ""Soul Man"". The law suit was finally settled and the movie was released in 2008. Then, days before the films release, two of it's stars, Bernie Mac and Issac Hayes, died on back to back days, a tragedy that created a public relations nightmare. For those reasons, this film wasn't widely distributed or advertised, which is a shame because it was one terrific film. The story starts 30 years after a legendary R&B group, Marcus Hooks & The Real Deal, broke up. We see the remaining members, Samuel L. Jackson in trouble with the law, and Bernie Mac, living in a retirement community, when they learn about the sudden death of Hooks. Record executives, quick to capitalize on his death, organize a tribute show at the Apollo in New York, and invite the Real Deal to participate. This means that two men who hate each other and haven't performed in almost 30 years, need to get their act together in a hurry if they want the big pay day and a chance at a come back. The film is an absolute riot, with Mac as the old lonely man and Jackson as the bitter forgotten convict. Their chemistry was nothing short of amazing and the big surprise was that both men can actually sing and dance! Even though they must have said mother f'er about a thousand times, I found the film to be very clever, funny, and original. If it wasn't for all the problems it had, this movie would have done much better than it did and it is without a doubt, worth watching.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,1787,"['Soul', 'Men', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'racked', 'problems', 'right', 'start', 'Originally', 'film', 'kept', 'getting', 'pushed', 'back', 'law', 'suit', 'R', 'B', 'group', 'Sam', 'David', 'claimed', 'be', 'farce', 'life', 'story', 'group', 'also', 'accused', 'producers', 'copyright', 'infringement', 'using', 'style', 'title', 'one', 'songs', 'Soul', 'Man', 'law', 'suit', 'was', 'finally', 'settled', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '2008', 'Then', 'days', 'films', 'release', 'two', 'stars', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Issac', 'Hayes', 'died', 'back', 'back', 'days', 'tragedy', 'created', 'public', 'relations', 'nightmare', 'reasons', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'widely', 'distributed', 'advertised', 'shame', 'was', 'one', 'terrific', 'film', 'story', '30', 'years', 'legendary', 'R', 'B', 'group', 'Marcus', 'Hooks', 'Real', 'Deal', 'broke', 'up', 'see', 'remaining', 'members', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'trouble', 'law', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'living', 'retirement', 'community', 'when', 'learn', 'sudden', 'death', 'Hooks', 'Record', 'executives', 'quick', 'capitalize', 'death', 'organize', 'tribute', 'show', 'Apollo', 'New', 'York', 'invite', 'Real', 'Deal', 'participate', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'hate', 'other', 'have', ""n't"", 'performed', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'need', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'hurry', 'want', 'big', 'pay', 'day', 'chance', 'come', 'back', 'film', 'absolute', 'riot', 'Mac', 'old', 'lonely', 'man', 'Jackson', 'bitter', 'forgotten', 'convict', 'chemistry', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'big', 'surprise', 'was', 'men', 'can', 'actually', 'sing', 'dance', 'Even', 'must', 'have', 'said', 'mother', ""f'er"", 'thousand', 'times', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'very', 'clever', 'funny', 'original', 'was', ""n't"", 'problems', 'had', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'did', 'doubt', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
