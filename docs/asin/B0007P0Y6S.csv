885703,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0007P0Y6S,Grady Harp,"[15, 15]","JAN DARA is one of those rare films that succeeds on many levels: the story as adapted from a famous Thai novel 'The Story of Jan Dara' by Utsana Phleungtham is one of intrigue and exploration of lust, revenge, and thwarted passion; the cinematography by Nattawut Kittikhun is incredibly atmospheric while at the same time pausing for some of the most beautiful studies of nature on film; the musical score by Chartchai Pongprapapan and Pakawat Waiwitaya mixes the exotic pentatonic Oriental melodies with quaint excerpts from early recordings of Richard Strauss and Puccini operas; the direction by Nonzee Nimibutr is so sensuously elegant that this film firmly establishes him as an important figure in international filmmaking.Simply stated, the story is about Jan Dara, the son of a woman who died giving birth to him, his life as an abused and unwanted child in the house of his 'father' spent searching for the love of his lost mother, his first encounters with passion and love, his adaptation to the realities of surviving in a family fraught with conflicts and bizarrely tangled interrelationships, and the disillusionment that comes with the discovery of his true family history and how the way his life comes full circle. It is a period piece and includes the outside effects of WW II in an otherwise sequestered house of strange isolation.While JAN DARA includes many sensuous scenes (the 'first memory' of Jan Dara is watching his 'father' in an indiscretion with his beloved aunt), these scenes are photographed so sensitively that they become studies like Kama Sutra paintings rather than being vulgar. The story makes many flashbacks and flashforwards and keeping the various actors at the different ages of these sequences straight can be problematic. The cast is uniformly excellent and credible, even when they may be too evil to watch!Here is an example of Oriental films that don't rely on choreographic martial arts to sustain interest. In that way it is similar to the beautiful SPRING, SUMMER, AUTUMN, WINTER, SPRING, and for those who enjoy the subtle arts of Asia this film is a must. Highly recommended.

""A New Yorker""","[10, 10]","I was quickly won over with one reviewer's perception of this film and sure enough this film was very interesting and intriguing enough for me to never leave my seat. Jan Dara opens with the eccentric statement that the film is based on the writer's first novel, and that it's not for religious people. Jan Dara is a young Thai with a traumatic background. The name ""Jan Dara"" is given to an infant boy whose mother died giving birth to him. The father (Santisuk Promsiri) blames the boy, actually giving him the name ""Jan"" the short form of a Thai word meaning ""accursed.""Believe it or not, that's probably when the father was nicest to the boy. His earliest memories recall his father's sexual relationship with his childhood nanny. Branded a ""bastard"" by his father, Jan is later disowned and cast out of the house. Years later Jan Dara returns to seek revenge by outdoing his father's sexual conquests. The movie rapidly progresses through Jan's childhood and the physical and emotional abuse involved. Before long, Jan is a young man (Eakarat Sarsukh) who struggles with his identity and his hatred for his father.The movie is set in an unspecified region of China in the 1920s through the late 1930s (a date is never given, but a newspaper mentions Pres., who was in office from 29 to 33). However, the outside world never affects Jan or his family. The reason the movie seems to be set there and then is that the producers needed what was a basically a feudal time, when the father was lord of his estate and could legally beat up servants and have sex with their wives.There is a tremendous amount of sex in Jan Dara. It's not sensual lovemaking, either, just people using each other in the harshest ways. Almost everybody has sex with everybody else. Father and son share concubines (although father doesn't know it). That warning for religious people to stay away now seems like a good idea. The biggest drawback is that the story proceeds much too quickly toward the end. All of sudden people are pregnant, married or missing, and it's never shown how or why. The only member of the cast who may be known to is Christy Chung, who plays the father's main mistress. Jan Dara is a good choice for fans who has a place in there heart for the love of foreign films believe me it captures mine.",4,Beautiful Thai film that's erotically dark,1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,2299,"['was', 'quickly', 'won', 'one', 'reviewer', 'perception', 'film', 'sure', 'enough', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'never', 'leave', 'seat', 'Jan', 'Dara', 'eccentric', 'statement', 'film', 'based', 'writer', 'first', 'novel', 'not', 'religious', 'people', 'Jan', 'Dara', 'young', 'Thai', 'traumatic', 'background', 'name', 'Jan', 'Dara', 'given', 'infant', 'boy', 'mother', 'died', 'giving', 'birth', 'father', 'Santisuk', 'Promsiri', 'boy', 'actually', 'giving', 'name', 'Jan', 'short', 'form', 'Thai', 'word', 'meaning', 'accursed', 'Believe', 'not', 'probably', 'when', 'father', 'was', 'nicest', 'boy', 'earliest', 'memories', 'recall', 'father', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'childhood', 'nanny', 'Branded', 'bastard', 'father', 'Jan', 'later', 'disowned', 'cast', 'house', 'Years', 'later', 'Jan', 'Dara', 'seek', 'revenge', 'outdoing', 'father', 'sexual', 'conquests', 'movie', 'rapidly', 'Jan', 'childhood', 'physical', 'emotional', 'abuse', 'involved', 'long', 'Jan', 'young', 'man', 'Eakarat', 'Sarsukh', 'who', 'identity', 'hatred', 'father.The', 'movie', 'set', 'unspecified', 'region', 'China', '1920s', 'late', '1930s', 'date', 'never', 'given', 'newspaper', 'mentions', 'Pres.', 'who', 'was', 'office', '29', '33', 'However', 'outside', 'world', 'never', 'Jan', 'family', 'reason', 'movie', 'be', 'set', 'there', 'then', 'producers', 'needed', 'what', 'was', 'basically', 'feudal', 'time', 'when', 'father', 'was', 'lord', 'estate', 'could', 'legally', 'beat', 'up', 'servants', 'have', 'sex', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'sex', 'Jan', 'Dara', 'not', 'sensual', 'lovemaking', 'either', 'just', 'people', 'using', 'other', 'harshest', 'ways', 'Almost', 'everybody', 'sex', 'everybody', 'else', 'Father', 'son', 'share', 'concubines', 'father', ""n't"", 'know', 'warning', 'religious', 'people', 'stay', 'away', 'now', 'good', 'idea', 'biggest', 'drawback', 'story', 'proceeds', 'much', 'too', 'quickly', 'end', 'sudden', 'people', 'are', 'pregnant', 'married', 'missing', 'never', 'shown', 'how', 'why', 'only', 'member', 'cast', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'known', 'Christy', 'Chung', 'who', 'father', 'main', 'mistress', 'Jan', 'Dara', 'good', 'choice', 'fans', 'who', 'place', 'heart', 'love', 'foreign', 'films', 'believe', 'mine']",N/A

There are so many films that focus on sex and the seemingly inevitable disastrous outcome of having it that its remarkable anyone has anything else to say on the subject.  Nonzee Nimibutr's film explores a multi-layered onion of sex, family, and above all, dysfunction.  As with most foreign films, the tone is heavy and the sex seems even more seedy, depressing, and ultimately pathetic.This might be precisely the point Nimibutr wants to make with Jan Dara, but it is difficult to give much back as a viewer.

Also, she not only looked glamorous and beautiful, she also learnt all her lines in Thai. She gets to sleep with the adolence lead and another woman.A few disturbing scenes in this film including the little boy witnessing his father having sex, and the scene when Christy assisted her lover to have an abortion that caused a massive of amount of bleeding.This film is provocative, and can be overwhelming for some mainstream viewers.

885708,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0007P0Y6S,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[5, 5]","JAN DARA is a Thai film based on the novel ""The Story of Jan Dara"" by Utsana Phlengtham. Directed by Nonzee Nimibutr (Nang Nak), the film caused quite a stir in Thailand because of its illicit material. I saw this film in early 2006 and it silenced my voice for awhile, I just couldn't bring myself to review it; I believe it's because of its strong and sensitive themes. Sometimes I think there is a double standard when it comes to film-making. When European film-makers produces a film with material considered ""taboo""; it is art, but if Asia makes a similar one; it would be extreme cinema. Jan Dara is not a sleazy sex film but rather an ""arthouse"" film with beautiful cinematography. The film gives a bleak view of Thai society in the 1930's and sexual relations during that period.  The film has a category III rating (equivalent to NC-17 in the U.S.)The tale revolves around a brutal, womanizing and abusive father who ruins Jan's life because his mother died during childbirth. His father Luang (Santisuk Promsiri) names him Jan Dara because ""Janrai"" means ""Accursed"" in the Thai Language. Luang beds almost every woman he lays his eyes on and constantly reminds Jan (Suwinit Panjamawat) that he is cursed and what is expected of him. Jan's stepsister Kaew is raised to hate him. Jan's anchor through these bleak times is his aunt Waad who becomes very close to him and his father's mistress Boonleung (Christy Chung). When his stepsister Kaew gets pregnant, Jan has to marry her as a way of vengeance. Jan Dara is poised to go on the same path as his hated father.""Jan Dara"" is a dark and moody look of damaged lives in 1930's Thailand and offers a very effective depiction of how low humanity can sink into. The film's premise is very depressing and quite frankly, Jan's father Luang is one of the most despicable characters I may have come across (in film) aside from Takeshi Kitano's character in ""Blood and Bones"". Much like ""Blood and Bones"", this film is about a very dysfunctional family but unlike ""Blood and Bones"", Jan Dara goes for very sensitive themes such as lots of visible sex, lesbianism, incest which are both hinted and shown. The film actually has three acts: 1) Jan's birth and childhood. His relationship with his father and aunt are explored. 2) Jan's ""coming of age"" as a teenager. He develops a relationship with a schoolmate he really fancies and his growing desire for love through sex. 3) The return of Jan in his father's household as an adult.Even with its dark and depressing premise of a truly dysfunctional family, the film looks very beautiful with its polished, proficient cinematography. The set designs are great and the music is alluring. The film also has some of the strongest scenes to hit home. Also, the sex scenes are beautifully shot and looks very clean but at the same time very erotic and sexy. Actor Suwinit Panjamawat has a very strong sex scene with beautiful Christy Chung that created quite a lot of controversy. Jan was suggested to be around 15-17 years old but the young actor was actually a lot older than the role he played.Christy Chung certainly has matured as an actress since her days as a beauty queen. Chung does a very solid performance as Boonleung, the actress had to learn to speak Thai and while she did carry a hint of Hong Kong accent, her performance is actually the one that catches the most attention. Her scenes draped in blankets and her nude scenes will forever be etched into the minds of her fans. She actually improves the stereotypical character of Boonleung. Another performance that is worth mentioning is that of actress Wipawee Charoenpura who plays Jan's aunt, Waad who develops a very close relationship with him that borders on incest.The film does have its weaknesses. Some characters aren't well-developed and Luang's character is one-dimensional and most of the women are just caricatures. Luang's anger is expressed through having sex with lots of women in the household to anger Jan, while the feeling of being unloved births Jan's reaction to sexual intercourse, he seeks comfort in lust. I guess the characters are pretty much ""black and white"" characters with little shades of gray. Also, some of the other supporting actors' performances are a bit wooden and didn't seem to express the needed emotions.Despite its faults, ""JAN DARA"" is a very good film. However, I have to warn everyone that the theme of the film is of such sensitive nature that only the most timid recommendation can be given. The last act of the film is so depressing and the climax is a bit disturbing. Anyone who watches this film would be well advised to have a copy of a ""feel good"" film or a comedy to watch after to remind yourself that life is still golden and still worth living for. ""Jan Dara"" is a beautiful film that uses sex to explore a person's state of being and even as a pessimistic commentary of a different society and its culture in a certain period.RECOMMENDED
