727326,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00007ELD4,Annie Van Auken,"[3, 3]","This edition of JOE AND MAX is packaged in a slimline case. Closed-captions and scene access are its sole extras. Has stereo sound and a clean widescreen image.The two actors portraying heavyweights Joe Louis and Max Schmeling (Roberts and Schweiger) are middleweights at best. Neither looks like the originals and their boxing skills are just passable. Roundtree is quite good as ex-boxer Jack ""Chappie"" Blackburn, Joe's mentor and manager, and Paymer, as Joe Jacobs, Max's Jewish-born American agent is the best thing in this film. (He's always excellent.)It often plays like a soap opera, presenting the separate personal woes of these men. Joe's gadabout romanticism destroys his marriage to Marva (Goines), a woman he deeply loves. Max comes to America twice to fight Louis, always hated as a N&aacute;zi by Americans who equate his German-birth with membership in that fascist party. As Schmeling often declares however, he's just a boxer, nothing more.For their first bout in 1936, Louis is an up-and-comer at age 23, Max at the peak of his game. As depicted here, their lengthy fight is a grueling one. By its end, the crowd that had been booing Max now chants his name and urges him to victory. Surely this change in loyalty of white fight fans from Louis to Schmeling was a factor that contributed to Joe's first professional loss.Between this Schmeling win and their '38 rematch, Louis defeats Jimmy Braddock and becomes heavyweight champ. In order to keep his verboten agent and be allowed to fight in America again, Max has to cut a deal with Germany's ""chancellor"" (who shall remain nameless here). He signs papers declaring Party allegiance, a lie Max has to live with.Both men train hard for their rematch, but Max is past his prime while Joe has two years of experience. This age advantage means Louis finishes his opponent off in the first round. Back in his country, Max is now a disgrace forced to enter the military. Joe by contrast is the hero who pounded to the canvas an evil N&aacute;zi. He volunteers for WWII service, is made a sergeant, fights exhibition matches and donates all his winnings to the relief of wounded soldiers.For boxing fans, the story pretty much ends here. We see Joe's struggles with the IRS and his being forced to fight well-past his time. An actor who looks even less like Rocky Marciano that Roberts does Louis, hands the aging pugilist his final defeat. At this same time ('52), Max and wife Anny (Wilson) have a mink farm that's going nowhere. Events will soon reunite the two fighters, but under different circumstances. Neither is wearing padded gloves or throwing punches.This one's worth seeing, but it's no sports movie classic. A middling grade..Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(6.5) Joe and Max (USA/Germany-2002) - Leonard Roberts/Til Schweiger/Peta Wilson/Richard Roundtree/Bruce Weitz/David Paymer/Siena Goines",3,"""Louis measures him...

727331,A2FUOXFJ74B32M,B00007ELD4,"P.K. Ryan ""The Ryan Identity""","[3, 5]","The true story behind this film set in the 1930's is truly interesting. Joe Louis and Max Schmeling were from two different worlds. One was an American ""Negro"" who was determined to overcome racial discrimination and become the heavyweight champion. The other was a German fighter with a Jewish manager who was a hero of the Third Reich. With World War 2 looming in the near future, these two superstars battled twice in the ring-each winning once-while their respective countries held them up as national icons. These two seemingly contradictory characters go on to become close friends, even as their countries become enemies.With that said, the film was downright disappointing. The acting was mediocre at best. The low-budget feel of the movie was so bad that I felt like I was watching a 1980's made-for-TV movie. The fight scenes looked so fake, they were almost comical. There was maybe two or three scenes where I was actually slightly moved, but otherwise, the film was a total bore. I'm sorry to say that the makers of this film failed to capitalize on a truly fascinating story.
