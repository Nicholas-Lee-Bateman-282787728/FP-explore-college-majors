I was a little disappointed that the box was not in perfect condition, it was pretty beat up.

We love entertainment in the genre of Buffy and Angel and Supernatural so Im glad Prime has free seasons of Grimm because my ENTIRE family is hooked!  So much, I even purchased the DVDs just so we own them outright, like we do the other series.  Very entertaining, and I always like that each episode starts and ends so you can pick up at any time.  Yes, there is a back story but its easy to catch up.
