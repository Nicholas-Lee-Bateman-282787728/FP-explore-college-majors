After months of doing that I decided to purchase the vhs tape.  I was told it was unavailable.I had a company search and find the video because I wanted it that much. It came brand new with two VHS Tapes. I had paid full price. It was expensive but I wanted it that much. I have the original movie nothing cut out of it. I am so pleased with the movie and it was worth the investment. I still enjoy watching it.I am sorry to hear that they are now editing scenes out of the DVD versions. I would like to get the full version in DVD but I will wait until they have an extended version of it. Wonderful movie.",5,This is a wonderful movie.

I also taped it years ageo on my vhs tape so I too know the scenes that they are talking about.  I do hope that some day they make it from the original and stop cutting out parts of movies.A country girl from Maine",1,all the rivers run,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,317,"['was', 'going', 'see', 'buying', 'movie', 'when', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'changed', 'mind', 'also', 'taped', 'years', 'ageo', 'vhs', 'tape', 'too', 'know', 'scenes', 'are', 'talking', 'do', 'hope', 'day', 'make', 'original', 'stop', 'cutting', 'out', 'parts', 'movies.A', 'country', 'girl', 'Maine']",All the Rivers Run VHS

A few years ago I saw this miniseries for sale and jumped at the chance of owning it and being able to see it whenever I wanted instead of waiting for it to be on tv. Unfortunately, to my surprise and dissapointment, it was the long awaited epic movie alright, except, OH NO! WHERE IS THE REST OF THE MOVIE???An important piece of almost every sceen had been....DELETED? I was so dissapionted that I almost sent it back, but for fear that it would be the only chance of owning it I kept it. I give the original version of this movie 5 stars. This one I would have to give a -0. If the original version of this movie is ever released, then, and only then will this great story be worth getting!",1,TRULY SHAMEFULL!!!
