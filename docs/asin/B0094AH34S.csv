1585064,A3JW06DZ1S5E2H,B0094AH34S,Daniel B.,"[2, 2]","l still have my cd recording of &#34;Simon Boccanegra&#34; with the golden-voiced Piero Cappuccilli as the Doge and the equally golden-voiced Jose van Dam as Paolo; Claudio Abbado conducts expertly, pacing the action so that the big scenes like the great Council scene can flourish. When I ordered this version, I did not think it could possibly match the older recording. But I have been pleasantly surprised and very gratified that this version from the Tutto Verdi series is a moving and powerful experience. First, Leo Nucci as a singer and actor deserves much of the credit for the impact of the performance. He plays Simon as a very old and weary Doge, worn down by his responsibilities and probably the many compromises his position has forced him to make. His sadness is palpable in scene after scene, and the mystique of power has long ago evaporated. This makes his joy at finding his daughter so rapturous; we feel he deserves this happiness, he has earned it as a just and generous ruler. This also makes his death unbearably poignant in the opera's closing moments. Leo Nucci makes you feel this . . . The other members of the cast are an amazing revelation of great singing! The tenor Francesco Meli fully deserves the swelling applause he receives at his curtain call: what a beautiful and controlled voice, he sings with passion and youthful energy and never produces anything but rich, mellow tones. What a career he has before him! I assumed that Mirella Freni from the Abbado recording would forever be my Amelia.  But I am stunned by the young soprano Tamar Iveri; her voice is so flexible she can sing every scene with exactly the tone, coloring and volume it requires. Her expressions reveal the pure soul within and she moves gracefully, with just the right gestures showing her emotions. And her voice is truly that of a Verdian soprano. I first heard Mirella Freni as Zerlina in &#34;Don Giovanni&#34; and was amazed how she grew in stature as Tosca, Madama Butterfly, Tatyana in &#34;Eugene Onegin&#34; as well as Verdi roles. I am confident that Tamar Iveri will have an equally illustrious career based on this peerless performance. As Jacopo Roberto Scandiuzzi underwhelmed me in the first act, but by the last act he was fully in character and voice. And what powerful, full-voiced singing he produced as he appears first as Simon's assassin and then, when he learns the truth about Simon and Amelia, his sudden friend and comforter. I have always considered &#34;Simon Boccanegra&#34; one of Verdi's masterpieces since hearing another great singer, Sherill Milnes, sing the role in Metropolitan performances. That means I have been exhilarated, moved and drained by this powerful tragedy for over forty years. If this opera is also one of your favorites, you have a wonderful new version to savor.",5,"""Simon Boccanegra"" - A Triumphant New Version of a Masterpiece, the great Leo Nucci leads a strong cast",1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,2828,"['l', 'still', 'have', 'cd', 'recording', '34', 'Simon', 'Boccanegra', '34', 'golden-voiced', 'Piero', 'Cappuccilli', 'Doge', 'equally', 'golden-voiced', 'Jose', 'van', 'Dam', 'Paolo', 'Claudio', 'Abbado', 'expertly', 'pacing', 'action', 'big', 'scenes', 'great', 'Council', 'scene', 'can', 'flourish', 'When', 'ordered', 'version', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'could', 'possibly', 'match', 'older', 'recording', 'have', 'been', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'very', 'gratified', 'version', 'Tutto', 'Verdi', 'series', 'moving', 'powerful', 'experience', 'First', 'Leo', 'Nucci', 'singer', 'actor', 'deserves', 'much', 'credit', 'impact', 'performance', 'Simon', 'very', 'old', 'weary', 'Doge', 'worn', 'down', 'responsibilities', 'probably', 'many', 'compromises', 'position', 'forced', 'make', 'sadness', 'palpable', 'scene', 'scene', 'mystique', 'power', 'long', 'ago', 'evaporated', 'joy', 'finding', 'daughter', 'so', 'rapturous', 'feel', 'happiness', 'earned', 'just', 'generous', 'ruler', 'also', 'death', 'unbearably', 'poignant', 'opera', 'closing', 'moments', 'Leo', 'Nucci', 'feel', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'are', 'amazing', 'revelation', 'great', 'singing', 'tenor', 'Francesco', 'Meli', 'fully', 'swelling', 'applause', 'curtain', 'call', 'what', 'beautiful', 'controlled', 'voice', 'passion', 'youthful', 'energy', 'never', 'anything', 'rich', 'mellow', 'tones', 'What', 'career', 'assumed', 'Mirella', 'Freni', 'Abbado', 'recording', 'would', 'forever', 'be', 'Amelia', 'am', 'stunned', 'young', 'soprano', 'Tamar', 'Iveri', 'voice', 'so', 'flexible', 'can', 'sing', 'scene', 'exactly', 'tone', 'coloring', 'volume', 'expressions', 'reveal', 'pure', 'soul', 'gracefully', 'just', 'right', 'gestures', 'showing', 'emotions', 'voice', 'truly', 'Verdian', 'soprano', 'first', 'heard', 'Mirella', 'Freni', 'Zerlina', '34', 'Don', 'Giovanni', '34', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'grew', 'stature', 'Tosca', 'Madama', 'Butterfly', 'Tatyana', '34', 'Eugene', 'Onegin', '34', 'as', 'well', 'Verdi', 'am', 'confident', 'Tamar', 'Iveri', 'will', 'have', 'equally', 'illustrious', 'career', 'based', 'peerless', 'performance', 'Jacopo', 'Roberto', 'Scandiuzzi', 'underwhelmed', 'first', 'act', 'last', 'act', 'was', 'fully', 'character', 'voice', 'what', 'powerful', 'full-voiced', 'singing', 'produced', 'first', 'Simon', 'assassin', 'then', 'when', 'truth', 'Simon', 'Amelia', 'sudden', 'friend', 'comforter', 'have', 'always', 'considered', '34', 'Simon', 'Boccanegra', '34', 'one', 'Verdi', 'masterpieces', 'hearing', 'great', 'singer', 'Sherill', 'Milnes', 'sing', 'role', 'Metropolitan', 'performances', 'have', 'been', 'exhilarated', 'moved', 'drained', 'powerful', 'tragedy', 'forty', 'years', 'opera', 'also', 'one', 'favorites', 'have', 'wonderful', 'new', 'version', 'savor']",N/A
1585065,A3PQJ6J7FOOWFG,B0094AH34S,"Dr. John W. Rippon ""May 19, 1932 and still going""","[1, 1]","Simon Boccanegra is a dark drama of low male voices with only a few rays of lighter tenor and soprano. It originated in 1857 and was substantially revised in 1881. The music is profound and deep. But it can be jarring as it swirls along with mature Verdi artistry and suddenly there is a passage from the 1850s. What a difference! It is still a favorite and I have followed it for more than sixty years. My first Simon was Leonard Warren and Leo Nucci is the latest. I've heard some great performances e.g. Vladimir Chernov with the Met in 1995(with the greatest Fiesco of all time and time to come - Robert Lloyd).  I've also heard some pretty bad ones. But even in those there is something to be gained just from listening to Verdi's extraordinary music. Yes you can hear the waves and smell the Ligurian Sea or define what the characters are thinking in that extraordinary music.As an overall effort I think this present disc is an excellent production. The singing on the whole is absolutely top rate. The amazing Leo Nucci has done it again. From his first run-in with Fiesco in the prologue to his final gasp at the end of Act 3 he is the center of attention. His voice is still respondant to the demands of the drama. Another great job of singing was that of Simone Piazzola as Paolo. His big resonant voice has graced several recordings as of late and he gets better and better; he even acted well in this one. The Amelia/Maria of Tomar Iveri was almost ideal. She looked the part of a noble waif of elegant demeanor and she has a big, lush, well rounded voice that can float a note when needed or fill an auditoriun whe aroused. Another one that looked the part was Francesco Meli He has a nice, well controlled, pleasing tenor voice and he is young and handsome. So many singers that try this part a barrel-chested, badly overweight, past prime has beens (remind you of anyone?). Another excellent deep voiced basso, beautiful to listen to, was that of Robert Scandiuzzi. What a pleasure to revel in that beautiful sound. I only he could learn to act.The costumes were beautiful. The sets initially were interesting; certainly better than the Wiener Staatsoper's bare scaffolding and nothingness in their 2002 release with Thomas Hampson. But I'm old fashioned; from the '40s to the '90s when you went to the opera there was something magical in being transported back in time and place to the setting as the composer visualized it. The grand hall of the council chamber was a replica of that hall in the time of the 14th century when the drama took place in the recording done in 1995 Met production under James Levine with Chernov and R. Lloyd. Wow! It was great. There is no magic in a raked slab on stage and a meaningles pile of painted boxes. Eurotrash!n.b As Simon Boccanegra is based on an historical incident, some years ago I went to Genoa to see If I could find any places of the settings. I could find no trace of the Boccanegra palace but I did find a bronze plaque indicating the place of the Fieschi. It is now aprking lot for a department store. The local museum has reconstructed the Grand Council Chamber and it's paintings. Beautiful!",5,Well Done ..

Mainly because it's Italian through and through and they understand this drama perfectly. Many muddled productions I have seen and this is where to story comes out best and most authentic.Leo Nucci is the perfect incarnation of the hero. The voice... the persona... the authority....(witness the council Chamber scene, it will nail you to your seat.) .. the emotion..... the pathos. Tamar Iveri grows stature in the role, maturing as the work progresses. Francesco Meli a glorious tenor, young, powerful, sensitive. Paolo Pecchioli as Albiani is much younger than in many former interpretations and his character is more three dimensional and easier to understand. I find Fiesco of Roberto Scianduzzi the least successful here, but he grows with the drama and his voice becomes very powerful by the 2nd and 3rd acts. Daniele Calligari is certainly one of the top conductors in this series. He finds much added richness in the score, his pacing is impeccable and so are his tempi. Overall effect is cumulative and overwhelming.I feel sorry for a certain reviewer who thinks it is ""underwhelming"", if I may be permitted to argue with someone who pictures himself as prime reviewer, but his credibility has been compromised before.

1585067,A2VWQXWF1GO2ZE,B0094AH34S,Noam Eitan,"[3, 4]","The cast is great, the staging and costumes traditional, yet for some reason this production doesn't take off.Francesco Meli scores the biggest success with the audience as Gabriele Adorno - sweet timbre, passion and ardor tempered with grace, ringing top, reserves of power - very impressive. Nucci as Simon Boccanegra is his usual self. I initially experienced some Nucci fatigue (this is Tutto Verdi or Tutto Nucci?). He forces a lot and it doesn't help to watch on video the physical efforts of this forcing, but the beauty of his style, phrasing, finesse and variety of shading win you over.  Tamar Iveri is among the best I've heard in the role of Amelia and Simone Piazzola's Paolo is incisive, with a clean and secure delivery.  Roberto Scandiuzzi as Paolo is noble enough but he doesn't have the goods for ""Il lacerato spirito"". It's interesting that in the disc's introduction it is mentioned that Verdi commented that the singer needs a voice of steel for this Romanza, exactly what Scandiuzzi lacks. I heard him a few years earlier in Vienna and he was no better. All singers articulate and project clearly. The conductor is adequate, not bad enough to explain why this doesn't work as well as it should.It's not easy to point out why this production does not have an impact. I think the staging stands in the way of the drama. It opened in Genoa in 2007 without any great success. There is a blu-ray from that (same) production with Frontali and it's the same story there - good cast, yet it doesn't add up. The staging is not intrusive, but the stage is cluttered and devoid of any grandeur. This opera does not work without grandeur. Video and sound are excellent.

Kreutzer,"[1, 1]","I have over 150 classical DVD/BRs that I watch on a 106&#34; screen and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6&#34; apart and the surround speakers are on my sides. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls. My reviews concentrate on the surround audio, as you can pretty much judge the video and stereo for yourself on youtube and similar sites.My collection includes the1995 Met performance with Domingo and Te Kanawa. It is a 4:3 DVD and although it has a DTS 5.1 sound track, I thought it was time to replace it with a Blu-ray.Picture is fine.Sound is DTS-HD MA 5.1 (or PCM stereo). The sound stage is not as wide as in some other recordings, about halfway to the surrounds. Orchestra is quite detailed and well recorded.Balance with chorus is very good, it favors the principals a tad. If you like to hear the singing as clear as possible, this is it. Voices are recorded with body mics and come through the center only, my only complaint.As soon as the music started, I was sold on that recording. Beautiful sound. All voices clear as a bell. Beautifully done.As usual, I had started listening with my eyes closed, but once I opened them, it became immediately clear what contributed to this beautiful sound: The staging!The floor is at a slight angle raised from the stage itself and looks like a cobblestone mosaic. It probably is not stone, but either way, the reflections will just peter out on that floor. The walls behind are all broken up with angles and gaps, nothing will give a bad reflection. The stage microphones are raised a bit more than usual of the ground and pointed towards where the singers stand most of the time.I would like to think that the staging was done with the desire to achieve good sound and not just accidental and the science of good sound will be incorporated in every staging. This is the opposite of  &#8220;Mose in Egitto&#8221;, where the staging is so detrimental to the sound.While I wished for a bit wider sound stage and the voices not just from the center, I'll still give it 5 stars for the overall very good sound.As for the performance, it is a bit static, but it is well sung by all principals with voices that are pleasing to my ear.
