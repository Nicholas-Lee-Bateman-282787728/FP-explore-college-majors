1384823,A2VMT89TCSF105,B00443YDWK,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[8, 13]","""Zeitgeist Addendum"" is the sequel to ""Zeitgeist: The Movie"". Both films are made by Peter Joseph, who is also the leader of the Zeitgeist Movement. While ""Zeitgeist: The Movie"" was an eclectic mishmash of right-wing conspiracy theories, critique of religion and vague pantheistic spirituality, ""Addendum"" is more obviously left-wing.In fact, the ideas in the film sound like a parody or caricature of Marxism. I frequently gasped when watching it. Joseph believes that all problems in society are fundamentally caused by scarcity. The solution is to create a global, classless, stateless, moneyless society of super-abundance based on free energy and very advanced technology. Work will be abolished by complete automation. Nanotechnology will make even surgical procedures automated. ""Addendum"" is filled with futuristic animations of UFO-like cupolas in the cities of tomorrow, and, of course, really fast trains.In other words, ""Addendum"" calls for communism and the immense development of the productive forces. Of course, the narrator doesn't use those somewhat tainted terms, preferring to call it ""a resource-based economy"" and ""sustainability"". However, I think it's obvious that Joseph must have studied Marxism. Even dialectical materialism with its thesis-antithesis-synthesis is included, but once again under different terms (""emergence"" and ""the best thing is to be wrong"").""Addendum"" also sounds like a caricature of the Red-Green left, with its contradiction between Green sustainability and modern (state-run) high technology. Murray Bookchin comes to mind. Thus, the film claims that *all* of our present energy needs - and more - can be solved by developing wind, solar, tidal, wave and geothermal power. (I didn't know there were still people who believed in the blessings of wave power.) All cars could be run on electric batteries, and airplanes could simply be abolished in favour of magnetic trains. I admit that I also used to believe in a kind of ""bright green"" cornucopianism such as this. Then I discovered the books of Vaclav Smil! I won't belabour the point here, except to state that the proposals in ""Addendum"" are completely utopian.Speaking of utopianism, I compared the message of the movie to Marxism above. However, there is one crucial difference. Marx could point to a very concrete social and political force that (presumably) could carry out his program: the international labour movement, with its unions, cooperatives and political parties. Later, the Soviet Communist leadership added national liberation movements to the list, and (of course) the political and military might of the Soviet Union itself. This, after all, is how social change happens: by the play of powerful social and political forces, or ""class forces"" if you like the Marxist terminology better. Today, Marxism is (to put it mildly) very much on the defensive, but it did ""work"" for a century or so. If in doubt, call the CIA!But how does the Zeitgeist Movement propose to change the world? It turns out that they are completely clueless. The labour movement, feminism, left-wing nationalism, the remaining Marxist or ""Marxist"" regimes, even the Green movement - they are all conspicuous by their complete absence. Instead, ""Addendum"" heavily promotes one Jacque Fresco, a lone genius who has discovered the correct vision of the future. Frankly, who the *hell* is Jacque Fresco?! Another force for change is ""technology"", but since machines can't function by themselves (yet), this means that technologists are the real movers and shakers of the revolution. Fresco and his Venus Project presumably see themselves as such. Shades of Saint-Simon and Positivism?If entrusting loving and caring technocrats with out future is a bit too much, ""Addendum"" has yet another proposal: individual spiritual transformation. Jiddu Krishnamurti is featured twice, and an extended quote from Carl Sagan is given a spiritual spin. The ""symbiosis"" mentioned by the narrator is presumably a form of pantheism. This explains the strong hostility of Joseph to established religion, monotheism in particular. It's a challenge to his own religion...The movie ends with a couple of concrete proposals for action. Most of them are meaningless, and simply amount to taking a purely personal stand against some particularly egregious institution. Sure, it's not ""wrong"" to boycott big banks or nuclear energy, but so what? No meaningful social change will happen through personal statements of this kind. These proposals are also illogical from the movie's own perspective. I can understand if doomers, peak oilers or Anthroposophists prefer to ""drop out"", individually or in small groups, but Joseph has a more statist, globalist and technological perspective on things. Why not demand that the federal government takes over the banks and starts issuing debt-free money, instead of calling on a few individuals to switch their bank accounts? Oh, I forgot, politicians will never accomplish anything, no really existing movement is even remotely interesting, only technicians like Mr. Fresco counts! In fact, after an extensive propaganda pitch for the Zeitgeist Movement's political perspective, the proposals at the end feel like a complete anticlimax. The most important ""action"" is simply to make more people watch the Zeitgeist movies...Marx would have seen ""Zeitgeist: Addendum"" as a perfect example of utopian socialism. A genius comes up with some brilliant ideas, they are propagated by a small group of devoted followers, the propaganda is often moralistic in tone, but since they have no political strategy, ultimately nothing comes out of it. Of course, it could be argued that Marx himself was a utopian socialist. In the end, his program also failed to transform the world. However, it can hardly be denied that old uncle Karl created more mischief than Peter Jospeh or Jacques Fresco will ever do.Thanks for the entertainment. :P",2,Utopian Zeitgeist or Quasi-Marxist

And if technology is important (and it is), why not mention Nikola Tesla and his invention of a wireless system of energy?But the main omissions, I thought, are surely gonna be spirituality and Natural Law, because a lot of people (solipsists, nihilists, atheists) have a hard time with those topics.

This grabs a bit from the other two outings and adds to them so this is a bit redundant.Here's the scoop. This segment tackles the stupid, corrupt and ultimately self destructive monetary system. It shows, with great detail, how it subjugates people. Everyone is caught in a cycle of revolving debt and the only ones who win are those at the top. It also shows, with the World Banking system and the Federal Reserve how the countries themselves, U.S. included, are caught in the same cycle. It also deals with energy, religion, politics and ""resource based economy.""As I mentioned, some of what is included here is in the other two installments, but if you haven't seen either of those this is a treasure trove of information. Given the facts and figures they throw up it all seems verifiable as well. The section on energy is very interesting. It shows how we can run oil free, with an abundance of energy, but the oil companies simply won't let that happen. This is true of any institution, which is why I don't give money to the American Cancer Society. They're into 'treating' cancer because, if they cured it tomorrow, there would be little need for them or the billion dollar industry they've sprouted.One area I need to delve into further is the concept of the ""resource based economy' as seen by ""The Venus Project."" Some of what was brought in regard to this seemed self contradicting. There just wasn't enough time to nail it at length.This is some great stuff.

Regardless of how much you hate money and capitalism, regardless of how much you want to see the world as you want it to be and not as it is, you can't deny the fact that for as long as there has been man, there has been money, or barter. Yet, somehow, these pseudo-intellectuals believe they can reprogram the human nature itself. According to them, if we move to a resource-based economy, there will be no money, no jails, people will all be happy because they'll no longer be stuck in boring jobs, everyone will have everything they need, and the world will all be sunshine and rainbows.Give me a break. Who's going to build all this wonderful technologically advanced world? A better question is, who's going to provide their labor with no compensation? Who's going to decide how much of those resources I need or don't need? What happens to all the homicidal maniacs, rapists et al who do what they do not for profit, but because they're sick in the head? What happens to the lazy people, greedy people, the megalomaniacs, the sociopaths? I guess they'll just magically cease to exist, or be magically cured by sunlight... Or something. This is communism in the guise of... Heck, I don't even know what to call it, but it's just as absurd.The movie implied that all these destructive impulses and behaviors exist because of our societal structure and are not our natural brain chemistry. This is speculation at best, with no basis in reality. I bet you cavemen who couldn't even verbally communicate, were stealing from and killing fellow cavemen who happened to have more meat and fur. Why do communist countries fail? Because you can't change the human nature. PEOPLE LIKE TO OWN STUFF, PERIOD. When in the early 90s the former USSR ran out of money, what did people do to survive? They bartered. There were ample resources around, but no one was willing to give away their cow's milk or their potatoes for free, and they couldn't care less if your family starved in the street as long as their own survived. Equality and selflessness are great concepts, but they don't work in the real world. So, good luck with that, guys... Yes, we're nasty, violent, selfish creatures, but at least the free market system compliments our greed and turns it into a motivator to do good. I DO believe the Fed is a huge problem, I DO believe the corporations have too much power, I DO believe we need to abolish the crony capitalism system we have now and return to the free market capitalism, but the ""solutions"" proposed by this movie aren't real solutions... They're unachievable utopian dreams. And every single attempt to reach utopia throughout history has ended in tragedy. Why should this be different?

Most people tend to think that everything the media tells us is the way it is, that politicians tell the truth 100% of the time, and that the government operates for the good of the people. Sadly however, our current society is far from that.In Zeitgeist you are exposed to the truth. They break down today's system of government and social structure which is based on a monetary system, show you how the monetary system is corrupt, and why it fails, then they provide solutions in their conclusion. The layout of the movie is structured very well and slowly unfolds into the solution of a resource based society.Even though I had known a lot about the corruptions in society, there was still plenty of information to be drawn from this film. For instance, I had no idea what an economic hitman was and would have never imagined our own government employing such people. Zeitgeist doesn't just tell this information through the narrator either, they bring in a former economic hitman and have him tell you everything first hand.If you are happy living a clueless life and are content with thinking that things are as ugly as they are right now just because that's the way things go, then don't watch this, but if you want to know the truth and see what is really happening then I suggest you watch this, and both of the other Zeitgeist movies as well.
