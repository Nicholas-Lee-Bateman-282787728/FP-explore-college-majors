But tragically, even this doesn't bringRoky back to sanity and his former musical talent.This is as good a documentary as I've ever seen. I especially loved thescenes of Roky singing, both in the old band and in his later years.His voice is a classic rocker's voice, and his song writing is up there withthe best. I had never heard of him but now I want to get a few of hissongs.There is a thin line between genius and insanity and we see this giftedsinger and songwriter walk the tightrope between the two. Hisfamily is pretty far out there also. If you love rock music especially youwill enjoy this documentary. It is happy and sad and hopeful. And some of the music is great.",5,As Good as it gets for Documentaries,1340409600,"06 23, 2012",2012,1469,"['Way', 'back', '1960', 'was', 'band', 'called', '13th', 'Floor', 'Elevators.There', 'was', 'lead', 'singer', 'band', 'incredible', 'talent', 'named', 'Roky', 'Erikson.Roky', 'coined', 'term', 'psychadelic', 'rock', '.This', 'story', 'musical', 'genius', 'descent', 'madness.He', 'was', 'busted', 'back', 'Texas', 'one', 'joint', 'marijuana', 'was', 'sentencedto', 'three', 'years', 'asylum', 'criminally', 'insane.He', 'was', ""n't"", 'insane', 'when', 'went', 'was', 'when', 'came', 'out.Fast', 'forward', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'see', 'Roky', 'living', 'mom.He', 'dozens', 'old', 'televisions', 'tuned', 'static', 'orhome', 'shopping', 'channels', 'rooms', 'house.His', 'old', 'band', 'members', 'tell', 'going', 'store', 'butthey', 'bring', 'where', 'are', 'playing', 'put', 'guitar', 'neck', 'push', 'out', 'stage', 'tragically', 'even', ""n't"", 'bringRoky', 'back', 'sanity', 'former', 'musical', 'talent.This', 'as', 'good', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'especially', 'loved', 'thescenes', 'Roky', 'singing', 'old', 'band', 'later', 'years.His', 'voice', 'classic', 'rocker', 'voice', 'song', 'writing', 'there', 'withthe', 'best', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'now', 'want', 'get', 'few', 'thin', 'line', 'genius', 'insanity', 'see', 'giftedsinger', 'songwriter', 'walk', 'tightrope', 'two', 'Hisfamily', 'pretty', 'far', 'there', 'also', 'love', 'rock', 'music', 'especially', 'youwill', 'enjoy', 'documentary', 'happy', 'sad', 'hopeful', 'music', 'great']",You're Gonna Miss Me : A Film About Roky Erickson
1067885,ADTZWVMMFTRAV,B000P0J060,Dan Plankton,"[5, 5]","The best recommendation I can make for this DVD is that it increased my appreciation for Roky Erickson's music--and I've been a fan for 20-plus years. In my opinion, the feature documentary would probably rate four stars. But despite some muddy sound and disjointed storytelling, I'm sure glad the film was made. Being a longtime fan, I knew the basic Roky story (minor fame with the innovative 13th Floor Elevators, followed by a marijuana bust that led to a damaging stint in a high-security mental institution, followed by a sporadic career in which Roky created brilliant music in the brief intervals during which he was able to function well). But this movie fleshed out his life story, making clear that Roky had schizophrenic tendencies all his life (apparently inherited from his mother's side; what little we see and hear of Roky's father - all but accused of molestation by one of Roky's brothers - gives that much more insight into the Erickson family tragedy).What really makes this DVD are the bonus features: about a half-dozen songs from 1977-84, a few spoken-word readings from Roky, and two ""postscript"" mini-documentaries from 2005 and 2007 (the film was completed in 2002). The 2005 documentary shows the build-up to Roky's comeback show at the Austin City Limits festival, and shows Roky much further recovered than he appears in the feature. It's truly inspiring. The 2007 postscript leaves the story a little up in the air--Roky wins his independence in court. You can see that Roky still lives in his own world, and probably can't live truly independently, but you get the impression he'll be OK with the support of the family, who are all in a much better state with Roky doing so much better.",5,Roky's rocky road,1184716800,"07 18, 2007",2007,1717,"['best', 'recommendation', 'can', 'make', 'DVD', 'increased', 'appreciation', 'Roky', 'Erickson', 'music', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', '20-plus', 'years', 'opinion', 'feature', 'documentary', 'would', 'probably', 'rate', 'four', 'stars', 'muddy', 'sound', 'disjointed', 'storytelling', ""'m"", 'sure', 'glad', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Being', 'longtime', 'fan', 'knew', 'basic', 'Roky', 'story', 'minor', 'fame', 'innovative', '13th', 'Floor', 'Elevators', 'followed', 'marijuana', 'bust', 'led', 'damaging', 'stint', 'high-security', 'mental', 'institution', 'followed', 'sporadic', 'career', 'Roky', 'created', 'brilliant', 'music', 'brief', 'intervals', 'was', 'able', 'function', 'well', 'movie', 'fleshed', 'out', 'life', 'story', 'making', 'clear', 'Roky', 'had', 'schizophrenic', 'tendencies', 'life', 'apparently', 'inherited', 'mother', 'side', 'what', 'see', 'hear', 'Roky', 'father', 'accused', 'molestation', 'one', 'Roky', 'brothers', 'much', 'more', 'insight', 'Erickson', 'family', 'tragedy', 'really', 'DVD', 'are', 'bonus', 'features', 'half-dozen', 'songs', '1977-84', 'few', 'spoken-word', 'readings', 'Roky', 'two', 'postscript', 'mini-documentaries', '2005', '2007', 'film', 'was', 'completed', '2002', '2005', 'documentary', 'build-up', 'Roky', 'comeback', 'show', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'festival', 'Roky', 'much', 'further', 'recovered', 'feature', 'truly', 'inspiring', '2007', 'postscript', 'story', 'little', 'up', 'air', 'Roky', 'independence', 'court', 'can', 'see', 'Roky', 'still', 'own', 'world', 'probably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'truly', 'independently', 'get', 'impression', ""'ll"", 'be', 'OK', 'support', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'state', 'Roky', 'doing', 'so', 'much', 'better']",You're Gonna Miss Me : A Film About Roky Erickson
1067886,ANIMV3SPDD8SH,B000P0J060,Guy De Federicis,"[2, 3]","A sort of 'Clockwork Orange' rock and roll documentary about Roky Erickson, lead singer of renowned late '60's garage band, 13th Floor Elevators, (who have gained deserving greater fame today than they did in their brief history), and his plunge into druggie mental illness and subsequent controlled sanity. It's another dysfunctional family documentary, like Terry Zwigoff's docu on underground comics writer, Robert ""Crumb"", where family members are revealed as social oddballs whose own sad turn of events rival the main pathos. Erickson was a heavy drug user, singled out by drug enforcement and finally busted on a marijuana charge and confined to a crude Texas mental institution for the criminally insane for three years, where, of course, he started a band, which included, for instance, a child killer on drums. Upon release he is a total social misfit, addicting The Cartoon Network as his new drug of choice. The film is not complete without the DVD extras which add a needed conclusion, (otherwise the skepticism is, once a heroin addict ...), but you'll have to decide if genius is lost between the pre-saved Erickson, reciting a harrowingly dark poem about family life in a drug induced stupor, and the post-saved rock 'n roller, likely to be found in a Starbucks signing autographs, and who the freaks are; the lunatic jumping the barbed wires of prison to go get high, or his symphonic tuba playing straight laced brother in a 'mommy loves me' session with his therapist.",4,I MISSED MY FLOOR,1189382400,"09 10, 2007",2007,1487,"['sort', ""'Clockwork"", 'Orange', 'rock', 'roll', 'documentary', 'Roky', 'Erickson', 'lead', 'singer', 'renowned', 'late', ""'60"", 'garage', 'band', '13th', 'Floor', 'Elevators', 'who', 'have', 'gained', 'deserving', 'greater', 'fame', 'today', 'did', 'brief', 'history', 'plunge', 'druggie', 'mental', 'illness', 'subsequent', 'controlled', 'sanity', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'documentary', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'docu', 'underground', 'comics', 'writer', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'where', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'revealed', 'social', 'oddballs', 'own', 'sad', 'turn', 'events', 'rival', 'main', 'pathos', 'Erickson', 'was', 'heavy', 'drug', 'user', 'singled', 'out', 'drug', 'enforcement', 'finally', 'busted', 'marijuana', 'charge', 'confined', 'crude', 'Texas', 'mental', 'institution', 'criminally', 'insane', 'three', 'years', 'where', 'course', 'started', 'band', 'included', 'instance', 'child', 'killer', 'drums', 'release', 'total', 'social', 'misfit', 'addicting', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'new', 'drug', 'choice', 'film', 'not', 'complete', 'DVD', 'extras', 'add', 'needed', 'conclusion', 'otherwise', 'skepticism', 'once', 'heroin', 'addict', ""'ll"", 'have', 'decide', 'genius', 'lost', 'pre-saved', 'Erickson', 'reciting', 'harrowingly', 'dark', 'poem', 'family', 'life', 'drug', 'induced', 'stupor', 'post-saved', 'rock', 'n', 'roller', 'likely', 'be', 'found', 'Starbucks', 'signing', 'autographs', 'who', 'freaks', 'are', 'lunatic', 'jumping', 'barbed', 'wires', 'prison', 'go', 'get', 'high', 'symphonic', 'tuba', 'playing', 'straight', 'laced', 'brother', ""'mommy"", 'session', 'therapist']",You're Gonna Miss Me : A Film About Roky Erickson

As a long time fan of his music (since I heard Burn The Flames in Return Of The Living Dead) I was really excited to hear about this documentary, which is so much more than just a documentary. Roky did get a bum rap when he was admitted at Rusk State Hospital, and despite his mothers efforts, he really had a hard time throughout the 80's and 90's. Luckily, Sumner, Roky's brother was there for him. You realy get a feel for how much of a caring person Roky's brother really is. If it werent for Sumner, Roky might not be hear to share his music with us. While this story starts out kind of grim, it ends with Roky breaking free of his past demons, which were truly real to him. It brought a tear to my eye seeing Roky take the stage again for the first time in almost 20 years. The guy always had this sutble gentleness to him and his voice was always so pleasing to the ear, especially to me because I love Rock N Roll and Roky is very influential. I hope to hear a new album from him. At 60 years old, the future seems bright for Roky who, along with his brother Sumner, helps to maintain health and stamina, as well as promote Roky's return to music. This is a magical look at a tragic character who pulls through to prove to the world that you can turn your life around and defeat depression and schizophrenia( whch really doesnt even exist). I look forward to one day seeing Roky perform. I totally recommend this documentary, it is really awe-inspiring. Here's to your health and happiness Roky.

Truth IS stranger than fiction, and this documentary is interesting in portraying a ""genius"" and his fall.I never heard of Roky Erickson or ""The 13th Floor Elevators,"" but I'm not a huge music history buff.  I just happened to snag this dvd at a local store because the topic sounded interesting: A truly gifted musician (writing and singing) fell from grace (so to speak) after using bad drugs.  After a period of time, he just lost his passion for music.Well, the movie begins with the youngest of five children attempting to become the guardian of his oldest brother through the Texas court system.  The mother is shown as a woman who believes that she can provide the best for her mentally-destroyed son, Roky, by not allowing him to take medicines to help him psychologically (the ""I don't believe in medical science"" bit"").  The documentary moves from the past history of Roky from his rise to fame to his problems with adjusting to reality and a mother who isn't able to fully understand why her son(s) is the way his is.  It is a fascinating documentary, and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen!Although my knowledge of music history is lacking, I couldn't stop thinking that the story of the musician Roky Erickson may be similar to Syd Barrett.  As a person who likes biopics, this documentary is on the same level as fictional accounts of Sid Vicious ('Sid and Nancy'), Jim Morrison ('The Doors'), and Ian Curtis ('Control').  With this movie, the background story of Roky is what makes this a great feature.  I learned about someone who was highly influential in the world of psychedelic music, not just a fictional representation of such a person.  You meet his wives, child, and girlfriends, as well as ex-band members and doctors.  There was quite a bit of research put into the documentary, and that is admirable and invaluable!I had some problems with the movie, and these may be more personal than universal. There is a missing brother who is not included in any of the footage.  The other two middle children are unable to fully reveal their feeling towards the lawsuit (they seem to purposely be distancing themselves from the documentary).  The father is the most complex character, but he is so distant that little is revealed about him (other than he lives next door to the youngest son and is nearly catatonic and anti-social).  The interviews with famed people of the musical world drop away in the last third of the movie.  There seems to be footage missing of the 'present' that creates bias on the filmmakers' part.  Perhaps it is already too lengthy of a feature?  I don't know.I enjoyed this documentary.  For me to not give 5 stars is difficult, but my opinions in the preceding paragraph are valid reasons for me to not give 5 stars.4 of 5 Amazon stars.

1067890,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000P0J060,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[0, 0]","This excellent documentary about Roky Erickson gives us great insight into his life so far as well as his success in the music industry. Sadly, we also witness his slow but sure descent into schizophrenia after using LSD over 300 times and other drugs as well. This story has it all: a broken family in which little is actually discussed; an ill son being cared for by a controlling mother who (very conveniently) does not trust psychiatry to help her son Roky; divorce; bands inside a high security psychiatric hospitals with murderers as members of the band--and even more.The movie flows well and there's little that could be edited out; it's all very interesting and Roky's story is told with great sensitivity and respect. His voice WAS incredible--and it still IS! He can still play guitar, sing well and jam with his band in live concerts after considerable counseling and psychiatric drug treatment for his schizophrenia. The cinematography is excellent and the interviews with Roky's brothers, his two ex-wives, his son, his mother, his father and others really impress me. It's also quite a testament to Roky's talent to have greats like Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top and Thurston Moore from Sonic Youth comment on just how influential Roky and the first band he played with, The 13th Floor Elevators, really were. There's also excellent archival footage from American Bandstand when Roky and the rest of The 13th Floor Elevators played on the show hosted by Dick Clark; and even the still photos of Roky back in the day are wonderful.As others have noted, the film opens with a court hearing about guardianship for Roky; the judge decides that Roky's brother Sumner would be a better choice for guardianship than Roky's mother who clearly has problems of her own. It's great to see Roky's transformation while he's living with his brother.It may well seem as if I've given the whole story away; but I assure you I didn't. The stories we get from Roky's two former wives are incredible; and there's yet another brief interview with a former girlfriend of Roky's that I also liked. The archival footage is electric in ways that words cannot express and the time Sumner interviews his own father about Roky is also quite interesting. There's quite a story about what happened to Roky when he was caught with a single marijuana cigarette; be on the lookout for that!The DVD comes with some nice extras. In particular, I liked the deleted scenes and the brief extra about the filmmakers. I'll let you discover the other bonus features on your own!This documentary is quite powerful, moving and memorable. Indeed, you'll be rooting for Roky just as I was because he is truly a decent human being with many charming qualities even when he's not feeling well. I highly recommend this film for people who enjoy biographies and people who enjoy rock from the 1960s.

However roky was a very good musician and pioneer.  this film shows us the shell that is left over , at the end of the movie we see him starting to come back. And in reality the man recovered a lot. Which is not in this movie. But he did go back to music! And now functions pretty well with help. But during the time of this film he was a shadow of a man.  I wish they'd added that to it later on because this ends with him still a shell like being.  I love the guys music though , especially the 13th floor elevators. the first psych rock band ever.  But if you watch this one , just remember that due to his brother he did return and is well enough to rock out in concert! Which is not what you would expect most people don't return from decades of heroin and lsd damage to become functioning again. This is the story of roky and his start of recovery.  Several other band members he knew weren't so lucky! the guitarist of the elevators was shot to death by his stoned wife! In 1978. His brother also escaped drug abuse , so that's another good part of this movie. THE dvd looks pretty good and the story is worth watching.

It's kind of like all the recent documentaries like Stevie and Capturing the Friedmans in this sense. Kind of makes you squirm kind of makes you watch on (I guess for some). But as an examination of a very talented person who fell on very hard times due to schizophrenia which may be genetic or may be pushed on by acid or shock treatment it left me feeling sad and empty. It shows everyone's view of Roky through their own self-interest. I think most people in this film have little understanding of mental illness. The seemingly sanest younger brother even blows it on his mentor's (and his belief too I'm sure) thoughts that Roky had to go mad because there was so much chaos on in the house so little lack of love. My guess is...probably not... given the mental illness of the mother and the symptoms of roky. Schizophrenia just doesn't manifest itself because there is too little love in the house. If so, many depressed people would become schizophrenics. I'd prefer just to hear Roky sing and watch some performances. I think he'd be happier with that too - with that being his legacy, as opposed this film which forces itself into his private world.",1,Exploitive view into a Mentally Ill man,1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,1265,"['film', 'interesting', 'family', 'treatment', 'mentally', 'person', 'who', 'really', 'just', 'be', 'famous', 'kind', 'recent', 'documentaries', 'Stevie', 'Capturing', 'Friedmans', 'sense', 'Kind', 'squirm', 'kind', 'watch', 'guess', 'examination', 'very', 'talented', 'person', 'who', 'fell', 'very', 'hard', 'times', 'due', 'schizophrenia', 'may', 'be', 'genetic', 'may', 'be', 'pushed', 'acid', 'shock', 'treatment', 'left', 'feeling', 'sad', 'empty', 'everyone', 'view', 'Roky', 'own', 'self-interest', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'film', 'have', 'little', 'understanding', 'mental', 'illness', 'seemingly', 'sanest', 'younger', 'brother', 'even', 'mentor', 'belief', 'too', ""'m"", 'sure', 'thoughts', 'Roky', 'had', 'go', 'mad', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'chaos', 'house', 'so', 'little', 'lack', 'love', 'guess', 'probably', 'not', 'given', 'mental', 'illness', 'mother', 'symptoms', 'roky', 'Schizophrenia', 'just', ""n't"", 'manifest', 'too', 'little', 'love', 'house', 'so', 'many', 'depressed', 'people', 'would', 'become', 'schizophrenics', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'just', 'hear', 'Roky', 'sing', 'watch', 'performances', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'happier', 'too', 'being', 'legacy', 'opposed', 'film', 'private', 'world']",You're Gonna Miss Me : A Film About Roky Erickson

It is also well-nigh incoherent, and since I watched it I've spent a good deal of time weighing whether this was intentional on the part of McAlester (The Dungeon Masters), as a kind of mirroring of Erickson's own thought processes, or whether that even matters (as clever/possibly brilliant as the idea is). I've come to the reluctant conclusion that it doesn't, and that something a little more straightforward would've gotten the job done a lot better than this did--which I rush to add in no way mitigates the straight-up creep factor this movie produces, which is almost unheard-of in the documentary realm.We begin with an arresting scene, in which Roky's little brother Sumner Erickson is testifying that he, not their mother, should be Roky's legal guardian, alleging that, basically, she's messed him up for the past thirty-five years. Powerful stuff. We then trade off scenes of Roky's life today with documentary bits about the rise and fall of the 13th Floor Elevators and the Aliens. (We eventually come back round to that courtroom scene towards the end of the film, after we've gotten to know Roky's mother even better than we've gotten to know Roky.) Pretty basic documentary technique, but (a) the historical bits seem almost unfinished; there's little snippets of interviews at the beginning with big-name folks like Patti Smith and Billy Gibbons, but those die off pretty quickly, and (b) the present-day bits featuring Roky seem as if they're there solely to create that creeptastic atmosphere, as contrasted to the present-day bits featuring Roky's mother, which are equally creeptastic, but at least move the story forward.But my ultimate complaint is that the film raises a lot of questions, and then never even attempts to answer any of them. The most obvious is how much of Roky's current state has to do with his incredible, massive drug abuse, how much has to do with the electroshock treatments he was subjected to while locked up in an asylum, and how much is genetic. (I'm no psychologist, but it seems to me you can't watch this movie and not come away well aware that crazy runs deep in the Erickson family.) Perhaps there is no real answer, at least not a definitive one, but no one even tries. We get a lot of bitter sniping from various family members, all of which goes nowhere. Etc. There are a lot of very interesting threads to be found here, but all are left ragged and incomplete.With a little more planning, a little more asking of the right questions, this could have been one of the great musical documentaries of all time. As it is, it's remarkably like the music of Roky Erickson and the Aliens--a curiosity that seems earnest, but that still has someone in the background looking at how to best hook the rubes come to look at the freaks. ***",3,"Harrowing, but misses the mark.",1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,3053,"[""'re"", 'Gon', 'Miss', 'Me', 'Keven', 'McAlester', '2005', ""'re"", 'Gon', 'Miss', 'Me', 'post-musical', 'life', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'call', 'career', 'psych-rock', 'pioneer', 'legendary', 'schizophrenic', 'Roky', 'Erickson', 'one', 'most', 'harrowing', 'things', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'celluloid', 'also', 'well-nigh', 'incoherent', 'watched', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'weighing', 'was', 'intentional', 'part', 'McAlester', 'Dungeon', 'Masters', 'kind', 'mirroring', 'Erickson', 'own', 'thought', 'processes', 'even', 'matters', 'clever/possibly', 'brilliant', 'idea', ""'ve"", 'come', 'reluctant', 'conclusion', ""n't"", 'something', 'little', 'more', 'straightforward', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'job', 'done', 'lot', 'better', 'did', 'rush', 'add', 'way', 'straight-up', 'creep', 'factor', 'movie', 'almost', 'unheard-of', 'documentary', 'realm.We', 'begin', 'arresting', 'scene', 'Roky', 'little', 'brother', 'Sumner', 'Erickson', 'testifying', 'not', 'mother', 'should', 'be', 'Roky', 'legal', 'guardian', 'alleging', 'basically', 'messed', 'up', 'past', 'thirty-five', 'years', 'Powerful', 'stuff', 'then', 'trade', 'off', 'scenes', 'Roky', 'life', 'today', 'documentary', 'bits', 'rise', 'fall', '13th', 'Floor', 'Elevators', 'Aliens', 'eventually', 'come', 'back', 'round', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'end', 'film', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'know', 'Roky', 'mother', 'even', 'better', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'know', 'Roky', 'Pretty', 'basic', 'documentary', 'technique', 'historical', 'bits', 'seem', 'almost', 'unfinished', 'little', 'snippets', 'interviews', 'beginning', 'big-name', 'folks', 'Patti', 'Smith', 'Billy', 'Gibbons', 'die', 'off', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'b', 'present-day', 'bits', 'featuring', 'Roky', 'seem', ""'re"", 'solely', 'create', 'creeptastic', 'atmosphere', 'contrasted', 'present-day', 'bits', 'featuring', 'Roky', 'mother', 'are', 'equally', 'creeptastic', 'least', 'move', 'story', 'forward.But', 'ultimate', 'complaint', 'film', 'lot', 'questions', 'then', 'never', 'even', 'attempts', 'answer', 'most', 'obvious', 'how', 'much', 'Roky', 'current', 'state', 'do', 'incredible', 'massive', 'drug', 'abuse', 'how', 'much', 'do', 'electroshock', 'treatments', 'was', 'subjected', 'locked', 'up', 'asylum', 'how', 'much', 'genetic', ""'m"", 'psychologist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'come', 'away', 'well', 'aware', 'crazy', 'runs', 'deep', 'Erickson', 'family', 'Perhaps', 'real', 'answer', 'least', 'not', 'definitive', 'one', 'one', 'even', 'get', 'lot', 'bitter', 'sniping', 'various', 'family', 'members', 'nowhere', 'Etc', 'are', 'lot', 'very', 'interesting', 'threads', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'are', 'left', 'ragged', 'incomplete.With', 'little', 'more', 'planning', 'little', 'more', 'asking', 'right', 'questions', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'great', 'musical', 'documentaries', 'time', 'remarkably', 'music', 'Roky', 'Erickson', 'Aliens', 'curiosity', 'earnest', 'still', 'someone', 'background', 'looking', 'how', 'best', 'rubes', 'come', 'look', 'freaks', '***']",You're Gonna Miss Me : A Film About Roky Erickson

In between articles about Van Halen and Jay Leno were the music reviews. One of the reviews covered an album by someone named Roky Erickson; I remember the article mentioned that he had once been with a group called The Thirteenth Floor Elevators. I never heard anything else about Roky, but somehow that review stuck in my mind.More than 20 years later, I came across this ""biopic"" about Roky. I read the synopsis and I was hooked. Roky had once been near the top when the Elevators seemed poised for stardom. In the years since, he'd been diagnosed as a schizophrenic, been confined to mental hospitals, and disappeared from the music scene.The human drama abounds in You're Gonna Miss Me. There is something about unfulfilled potential that fascinates. The unanswerable question ""What might have been?"" nags at me. Roky's family was tortured (to say the least) and their conflicts came into the open when they tried to decide how to care for him. You're Gonna Miss Me bares many family secrets.My only complaint about this film is the volume. The sound is clear, but the music scenes are much louder than are the other scenes. I had to adjust the volume throughout.Don't miss You're Gonna Miss Me (haha).",5,What Became of Roky Erickson?,1264204800,"01 23, 2010",2010,1288,"['Way', 'back', 'summer', '1986', 'bought', 'first', 'copy', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'magazine', 'articles', 'Van', 'Halen', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'were', 'music', 'One', 'reviews', 'covered', 'album', 'someone', 'named', 'Roky', 'Erickson', 'remember', 'article', 'mentioned', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'group', 'called', 'Thirteenth', 'Floor', 'Elevators', 'never', 'heard', 'anything', 'else', 'Roky', 'somehow', 'review', 'stuck', 'mind.More', '20', 'years', 'later', 'came', 'biopic', 'Roky', 'read', 'synopsis', 'was', 'hooked', 'Roky', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'top', 'when', 'Elevators', 'seemed', 'poised', 'stardom', 'years', ""'d"", 'been', 'diagnosed', 'schizophrenic', 'been', 'confined', 'mental', 'hospitals', 'disappeared', 'music', 'scene.The', 'human', 'drama', ""'re"", 'Gon', 'Miss', 'Me', 'something', 'about', 'unfulfilled', 'potential', 'unanswerable', 'question', 'What', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'nags', 'Roky', 'family', 'was', 'tortured', 'say', 'least', 'conflicts', 'came', 'open', 'when', 'tried', 'decide', 'how', 'care', ""'re"", 'Gon', 'Miss', 'Me', 'many', 'family', 'only', 'complaint', 'film', 'volume', 'sound', 'clear', 'music', 'scenes', 'are', 'much', 'louder', 'are', 'other', 'scenes', 'had', 'adjust', 'volume', 'throughout.Do', ""n't"", 'miss', ""'re"", 'Gon', 'Miss', 'Me', 'haha']",You're Gonna Miss Me : A Film About Roky Erickson

I had the privilege of seeing the premier of this film on July 13, 2007 in Austin, Texas in celebration of Roky's 60th Birthday.  It was an outstanding experience.  To top things off, after the film, Roky gave an absolutely amazing live performance with his current band The Explosives.  What a night.  Roky and the Explosive rocked like no one I've seen do in a long, long time.  The band was tight and under Roky's leadership, literally brought the house down.  Outstanding!The film provides a good deal of insight into Roky's life beginning with his childhood in Austin, Texas throughout his legal and psychiatric bouts and issues.  What was amazing to me, was to see how, at a time in his life while under the guardianship of his mother, it seemed as though there remained no desire whatsoever (and perhaps ability as well) for Roky to continue to create and perform music, which he is so gifted at doing and so clearly loves to do.  Seeing his band perform after the film, was proof that Roky Erickson is back, is alive and well, and is in tip-top form!!You're Gonna Miss Me contains early film footage of the 13th Floor Elevators, including a wonderful clip of their appearance on Dick Clark's American Band.  In addition to a great amount of really great nostalgic film footage from the initial days of the psychedelic era, the film is sprinkled with appearances from Erickson family members and friends, Austin law enforcement officers, and commentary from Roky's many admirers, including Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top and the great Austin, Texas artist Jim Franklin.Although I have been a rocker and music fan for many, many years, I have actually just discovered and turned-on to Roky's music.  I am so glad I did.  Purchase ""You're Gonna Miss Me"", you won't be disappointed.  Then proceed to explore Roky's music, if you haven't already.
