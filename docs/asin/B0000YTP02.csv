I figured it would be about some boy and his lion and that would be basicly it, but shockingly, it really isn't.The story revolves around a boy (Haley Joel Osment) who gets ditched at his two great uncles' house while his trampy mother supposedly goes back to school. There, the boy begins to learn about his uncles and their exciting past. The stories are far-fetched, yet that's the way they're supposed to be. Later, the boy has to decide whether or not the stories are fact or fiction when conflicts begin to arise. It's a very enjoyable movie.

Second Hand Lions has come and gone in the box office, finishing in the ""warm hit"" category receiving nearly $42 million at the box office. Unfortunately, even though those numbers are decent, nowadays its kind of ""eh"". I have to say, this movie should have made triple its earnings.Robert Duvall and Micheal Caine (This is no shocker) give fantastic performances as grouchy, mysterious, old uncles. Many questions arise: They may or may not have robbed the most powerful Sahib in Arabia...Their ability to buy anything they wish shows they have oodles of money hidden somewhere, but where? Are they former bank robber's, retired to the comfort's of the old farm? Confused? So is their Nephew, when he is dropped in their laps during hard times. He takes it upon himself to find out the details of his Uncles former lives.Its Been cool watching Haley Joel Osment go from practically a baby in Forrest Gump, to a child star in Sixth Sense, on to a smashing performance in A.I. Now we see him as a pubescent, voice cracking, young teen. At first I didn't think they could fit his square pegged (practically massive persona acting-wise) into this round hole (simple, yet complicated role), but after watching just a few scenes, my reservations melted away.Just as the Granpa in PRINCESS BRIDE would probably say this story is one of: ""War, Romance, True Love, Villains, Revenge..."" The list goes on. At the end of the film, and this is a nice touch, they don't quite seal the package - answer every single question. Fine by me. The average filmgoer has enough brains to come up with their own conclusion's, luckily the studio had faith in the truth of that.

789462,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B0000YTP02,Alistair McHarg,"[6, 7]","Secondhand Lions has a whole lot going for it, not the least of which is pairing veterans Michael Caine and Robert Duvall as two crotchety, semi-demented brothers living on a remote farm.  While others in a similar age bracket might get their kicks from a rousing game of checkers, these lovable codgers wait for intrepid door-to-door salesmen to stop by - and then blast them with shotguns.  Sound improbable?  It is.  But this entire film exists in a parallel universe, a fun one to visit.Secondhand Lions is not a great movie, Brazil is a great movie.  However, it is a wonderful movie.  A golden glow covers the cornfield, pond, and ramshackle farmhouse.  You know instantly that these scowling curmudgeons will grow to love young Walter, and that his presence in their lives will stir the soup in interesting ways.  The return of Walter's neglectful mother, with yet another wretched male, is equally predictable - and yet - it's satisfying when it arrives.  It isn't long before, rather than feeling sad for poor Walter, dumped on the doorstep of these misanthropes, we come to envy him.This movie concludes with what might be described as magic realism.  But by then, it is far too late; you are already in love with all the key players.  Never before has stunt flying been quite so dramatic!  As the exotic inhabitants of the storied past begin to appear, thereby validating the fantastic stories no little boy in his right mind would dare to believe, one is tempted to ask - what is more remarkable, fighting in the French Foreign Legion, or being abandoned by your mother and learning about love and compassion from two anti-social grizzlies who rock on the porch all day with shotguns resting in their laps?A terrific movie that anyone, especially families, can enjoy.",4,First Rate Fun,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,1779,"['Secondhand', 'Lions', 'whole', 'lot', 'going', 'not', 'least', 'pairing', 'veterans', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'two', 'crotchety', 'semi-demented', 'brothers', 'living', 'remote', 'farm', 'others', 'similar', 'age', 'bracket', 'might', 'get', 'kicks', 'rousing', 'game', 'checkers', 'lovable', 'codgers', 'wait', 'intrepid', 'door-to-door', 'salesmen', 'stop', 'then', 'blast', 'shotguns', 'Sound', 'improbable', 'entire', 'film', 'exists', 'parallel', 'universe', 'fun', 'one', 'visit.Secondhand', 'Lions', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'Brazil', 'great', 'movie', 'However', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'golden', 'glow', 'cornfield', 'pond', 'ramshackle', 'farmhouse', 'know', 'instantly', 'scowling', 'curmudgeons', 'will', 'grow', 'love', 'young', 'Walter', 'presence', 'lives', 'will', 'stir', 'soup', 'interesting', 'ways', 'return', 'Walter', 'neglectful', 'mother', 'yet', 'wretched', 'male', 'equally', 'predictable', 'yet', 'satisfying', 'when', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'rather', 'feeling', 'sad', 'poor', 'Walter', 'dumped', 'doorstep', 'misanthropes', 'come', 'envy', 'him.This', 'movie', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'described', 'magic', 'realism', 'then', 'far', 'too', 'late', 'are', 'already', 'love', 'key', 'players', 'Never', 'stunt', 'flying', 'been', 'quite', 'so', 'dramatic', 'exotic', 'inhabitants', 'storied', 'past', 'begin', 'appear', 'thereby', 'validating', 'fantastic', 'stories', 'little', 'boy', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'dare', 'believe', 'one', 'tempted', 'ask', 'what', 'more', 'remarkable', 'fighting', 'French', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'being', 'abandoned', 'mother', 'learning', 'love', 'compassion', 'two', 'anti-social', 'grizzlies', 'who', 'rock', 'porch', 'day', 'shotguns', 'resting', 'laps', 'terrific', 'movie', 'anyone', 'especially', 'families', 'can', 'enjoy']",Secondhand Lions

789480,A1YC9XEDFKXPLK,B0000YTP02,Armando M. Mesa,"[3, 3]","Story focuses on a boy literally dumped off by his ""good for nothin'"" opportunist mom on the doorsteps of two brothers (great uncles to the boy). She hopes he will discover where the uncles have stashed an enormous amount of cash so that she and her son can reap or enjoy the bountiful treasure. Everyone wants the hidden loot ( from conniving nasty relatives, all- to- eager stock-investment and intrusive insurance dealers to  trespassing salesmen---none of them are welcomed on the men's property ).You can literally see the dollar signs in these people's eyes flashing and hear cha-ching in the background in a sort of cartoonesque manner. Meanwhile the two men literally raise young Walter and teach him valuable lessons on how to be a man and about life in general through their daily actions, heart to heart speeches and Indiana Jones-like flashbacks of the uncles' escapades as young men in their prime.One of the uncles also tells Walter about the secret or method he lives by to attaining faith and belief in the truth (or what he perceives to be the truth) to anything in life. The love -is- what- is- most- important (love conquers all)lesson gets interwoven into one of the talks as well. However, rumor has it that the men may have acquired the money through bank robbery heists or as hit men for the mafia...Do in fact the men even possess such a vastly hidden wealth ? And why were they absent for 40 years from their hometown and then re-emerge? Are they feeding Walter delusional stories of grandeur about their early days as swashbucklers as a cover up to some hidden secret or to just pass the time ?... I highly suggest you rent this dvd or even buy it to see what happens !Whether this film may be syrupy or sappy for some, it made me feel good just seeing it. I had my preconceived notions about this film and one of those notions was that it was going to be a saccharine inducing comatose viewing experience. Wrong. With grand actors like Duvall and Caine and Osment's proven acting ability (The Sixth Sense anyone?...) you know you are going to get your entertainment's value worth...Caine, Duvall and Osment along with Sedgewick do an outstanding job that really brings this movie to life.Almost everyone has raved about the performances by the first three actors. Kira Sedgewick turns in one that is a fine semi- comedic performance. However, the character as a worthless mother and scheming con artist will not endear anyone. Her stupid and insensitive actions and ravings make one hope that she gets all she deserves and then some. At first, one wants to feel sorry for her character as a supposedly struggling single mother; but when she uses her own child for a scam all sympathetic sentiments are off !  Very entertaining colorful characters and performances ! While there was some drama there was also a good dose of comedic wit by Duvall and Caine (in some scenes the most subtlest of ways)! Even the story flashbacks took a jab at the Indiana Jones films but with a much light hearted homage.This is excellent entertaining family fodder. My last thought about Second Hand Lions is that this would also make a great dvd to view or to buy for someone on Father's Day due to  seeing the paternal-like relationship between the uncles and the boy ! Whatever message or meaning you can derive from Second Hand Lions it is all positive and good in a clean and wholesome familial sense not found in many movies these days.",5,Didn't Think I Was Gonna Like It...,1077062400,"02 18, 2004",2004,3449,"['Story', 'focuses', 'boy', 'literally', 'dumped', 'off', 'good', 'nothin', 'opportunist', 'mom', 'doorsteps', 'two', 'brothers', 'great', 'uncles', 'boy', 'will', 'discover', 'where', 'uncles', 'have', 'stashed', 'enormous', 'amount', 'cash', 'son', 'can', 'reap', 'enjoy', 'bountiful', 'treasure', 'Everyone', 'hidden', 'loot', 'conniving', 'nasty', 'relatives', 'all-', 'to-', 'eager', 'stock-investment', 'intrusive', 'insurance', 'dealers', 'trespassing', 'salesmen', '-none', 'are', 'welcomed', 'men', 'property', '.You', 'can', 'literally', 'see', 'dollar', 'signs', 'people', 'eyes', 'flashing', 'hear', 'cha-ching', 'background', 'sort', 'cartoonesque', 'manner', 'Meanwhile', 'two', 'men', 'literally', 'raise', 'young', 'Walter', 'teach', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'how', 'be', 'man', 'life', 'general', 'daily', 'actions', 'heart', 'heart', 'speeches', 'Indiana', 'Jones-like', 'flashbacks', 'uncles', 'escapades', 'young', 'men', 'prime.One', 'uncles', 'also', 'tells', 'Walter', 'secret', 'method', 'attaining', 'faith', 'belief', 'truth', 'what', 'be', 'truth', 'anything', 'life', 'love', '-is-', 'what-', 'is-', 'most-', 'important', 'love', 'conquers', 'lesson', 'interwoven', 'one', 'talks', 'as', 'well', 'However', 'rumor', 'men', 'may', 'have', 'acquired', 'money', 'bank', 'robbery', 'hit', 'men', 'mafia', 'Do', 'fact', 'men', 'even', 'possess', 'vastly', 'hidden', 'wealth', 'why', 'were', 'absent', '40', 'years', 'hometown', 'then', 're-emerge', 'Are', 'feeding', 'Walter', 'delusional', 'stories', 'grandeur', 'early', 'days', 'swashbucklers', 'cover', 'up', 'hidden', 'secret', 'just', 'pass', 'time', 'highly', 'suggest', 'rent', 'dvd', 'even', 'buy', 'see', 'what', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'syrupy', 'sappy', 'made', 'feel', 'good', 'just', 'seeing', 'had', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'film', 'one', 'notions', 'was', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'saccharine', 'inducing', 'comatose', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Wrong', 'grand', 'actors', 'Duvall', 'Caine', 'Osment', 'proven', 'acting', 'ability', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'anyone', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'entertainment', 'value', 'worth', 'Caine', 'Duvall', 'Osment', 'Sedgewick', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'really', 'movie', 'life.Almost', 'everyone', 'raved', 'performances', 'first', 'three', 'actors', 'Kira', 'Sedgewick', 'one', 'fine', 'semi-', 'comedic', 'performance', 'However', 'character', 'worthless', 'mother', 'scheming', 'con', 'artist', 'will', 'not', 'endear', 'anyone', 'stupid', 'insensitive', 'actions', 'ravings', 'make', 'one', 'hope', 'then', 'first', 'one', 'feel', 'sorry', 'character', 'supposedly', 'struggling', 'single', 'mother', 'when', 'own', 'child', 'scam', 'sympathetic', 'sentiments', 'are', 'Very', 'entertaining', 'colorful', 'characters', 'performances', 'was', 'drama', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'dose', 'comedic', 'wit', 'Duvall', 'Caine', 'scenes', 'most', 'subtlest', 'ways', 'Even', 'story', 'flashbacks', 'took', 'jab', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'films', 'much', 'light', 'hearted', 'homage.This', 'excellent', 'entertaining', 'family', 'fodder', 'last', 'thought', 'Second', 'Hand', 'Lions', 'would', 'also', 'make', 'great', 'dvd', 'view', 'buy', 'someone', 'Father', 'Day', 'due', 'seeing', 'paternal-like', 'relationship', 'uncles', 'boy', 'message', 'meaning', 'can', 'derive', 'Second', 'Hand', 'Lions', 'positive', 'good', 'clean', 'wholesome', 'familial', 'sense', 'not', 'found', 'many', 'movies', 'days']",Secondhand Lions

You can be home alone, single, divorced, widowed, whatever and you'll absolutely love this movie.It stars Haley Joel Osment, who never makes a mistake when he chooses to do a film. He has amazing screen presence, and what's even more amazing is that he's a child actor. Robert Duvall and Michael Caine also star as his two Rough Around The Edges uncles. These three together prove to be an awesome combination, Osment probably being the only child actor that can stand up to the abilities of these two screen legends.Osment plays Walter, who is dumped off one summer by his mother to find out where his uncles have been the past forty years, but more importantly, to find the millions of dollars they supposedly have stashed away. Not only do we get the story of Walter and his two uncles, we also get the backstory of where they were all those years and how they came across their fortune. Flashback scenes are hard to do without seeming hokey, but these are done well and tell the exact kind of story that a twelve year old boy would want to hear. Christian Kane stars as the young Uncle Hub, and though he hardly talks at all throughout the flashbacks, he's the main reason the flashbacks are so amazing.I definitely recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a great movie because this movie has everything anyone could hope for when seeing a film-- comedy, sword fights, airplane acrobatics, and a secondhand lion.

He comes to understand them and some of life through several events.

Among her last admonitions to her son is to find out where his uncles keep their money--and despite their hermitous behavior, they do seem to have an unlimited supply of it, going so far as to order a live lion by mail in hopes of enjoying a hunt.  Slowly Walter is drawn more and more into the lives--past and present--of the two men, who seem to have either lived adventures that would suit any Errol Flynn character or to be, perhaps, successful bank robbers on the lam.  They're also thoroughgoing eccentrics who fish their stock pond with shotguns rather than rods and reels--and drive off an endless succession of travelling salesmen with the same weapons.  As the summer progresses, Walter and his uncles develop a genuine if unspoken fondness for each other, and when mama Mae returns with her latest light-o'-love, a private detective (Michael O'Neill) with an agenda of his own, a confrontation occurs that will change all their lives forever.

This film is so entertaining that my daughters both begged me to buy it after having seen it only once... and we've watched it several times with friends who all loved it as much as we do.Michael Caine, Robert Duvall, and Haley Joel Osment give spectacular performances in this extremely heart-felt and hilarious story about how two aging reclusive uncles with a mysterious past care for their nephew one memorable summer. Young Walter (Haley Joel Osment) is dropped off at his uncle's sprawling Texan estate one summer day by his flighty, irresponsible mother with instructions to ""find out where they hid the money,"" and practice smiling more. After watching his mother drive off down the dusty road with the dogs barking and chasing along behind, Walter sits down on the big wooden porch with his uncles and discovers they have no telephone... and no TV. ""What do you do for fun?"" Walter asks... and his uncles' answer is both surprising and funny, when a traveling salesman drives up to pitch his wares.The main mystery in this film is whether the larger-than-life stories that the uncles tell Walt of heroic deeds in exotic lands are really true... or whether they are actually dangerous bank robbers. Walter discovers that sometimes the facts don't matter nearly as much as the qualities described by Duvall's character in a ""long speech I give young men."" It's delightful to watch Walter gain a sense of confidence and trust in the world, as his eccentric uncles do their best to share things they most enjoy with their young nephew.This film gets its name from a memorable experience when the uncles purchase a lion ""second-hand"" as part of plan to do some big game hunting... and then make the discovery that this used lioness arrives in no shape to provide proper sport. When Walter offers that he can nurse the lioness back to health, he finds more courage and strength than he'd ever had a chance to demonstrate before.Robert Duvall and Haley Joel Osment give truly extraordinary performances that will be long remembered in SECONDHAND LIONS.

789540,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B0000YTP02,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[26, 30]","Perception is a powerful, but misleading tool in the arsenal of human discovery.  It can lead to a lot of discovery but can also mislead.  Sometimes we can look at an old man, see nothing but a man past his prime, and we forget the life that he led.  Sometimes we can look at an innocent, weak young boy and forget that this boy could one day be a man with lots of power.  SECONDHAND LIONS is a film about perception and whether we, the audience, know what is true or not.Walter (Haley Joel Osmet, The Sixth Sense) is a young boy without any direction.  His mother (Kyra Sedgwick, Personal Velocity) is flighty and incredibly selfish.  We she seizes on an opportunity to meet a new man she drops Walter off at her great-uncles', to spend the summer with them.Those men are named Garth (Michael Caine, Little Voice) and Hub (Robert Duvall, The Apostle).  The rumor is they have a large sum of money, and Walter's mother seems to think that if he gets all buddy- buddy with them, maybe that small fortune could one day become theirs.  Walter is in for the summer of his life.  A summer full of crazy adventures, a giraffe in a cornfield, swashbuckling, riveting stories of adventure, beautiful princesses, and of course, a lion named Jasmine.SECONDHAND LIONS is the kind of film I love.  Sure it's light and fluffy, but it's also filled with interesting characters and surprises around every corner.  It's a fantasy without being a cartoon, a farce with a little bit of heart.  It does something very few films attempt these days.  It inspires true imagination.Of course I have some minor squabbles.  The film overstays it's welcome.  Creating an ending that is far too sentimental and far too forced.  After the self-discovery, you want to leave the characters to just be.  SECONDHAND LIONS just sits there like a lump, giving us endless shots of the older Walter (Josh Lucas) and an old cop talking about the past.  I would have preferred the film end by keeping us guessing.  But alas, it has to answer the one question that lets the rest of the story down: Are the old stories true?Duvall and Caine are incredibly charming as Garth and Hub.  Their men with more stories to tell, and yet they won't tell you unless you ask.  They have this sarcastic wit about them that propels the story further.  I loved the scene where Duvall's character beats up the teenagers.  How cocky do some of us young people think we are?  It's nice to be put in our place by a man with so many years behind his belt.  Caine knows the score and plays the straight man with a subtle grace.  I like how he deals with Duvall.  How the characters feel like brothers, and not like two men acting.Writer/Director Tim McCanlies (Dancer, Texas Pop 81) has created a film that is both watch able and enchanting all at the same time.  He captures rural Texas as a dustbowl of boredom, with magic hiding in the corn.  My favorite shot is that of this tall giraffe that rides into focus on a flatbed truck.  I loved how incredibly silly that thought was.SECONDHAND LIONS is worth a trip to the cinema.  It's worth a night curled up by a warm fire.  Sure, it's not the greatest of these kinds of movies, but for that I recommend you sit down with THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN.  If you're looking for a safe and sweet trip into the past, or you love run-ins with lions, give this SECONDHAND LION a try.***1/2 out of 5",3,Great..But Soured By An Overly Sentimental Ending!!!!,1076544000,"02 12, 2004",2004,3388,"['Perception', 'powerful', 'misleading', 'tool', 'arsenal', 'human', 'discovery', 'can', 'lead', 'lot', 'discovery', 'can', 'also', 'mislead', 'Sometimes', 'can', 'look', 'old', 'man', 'see', 'nothing', 'man', 'prime', 'forget', 'life', 'led', 'Sometimes', 'can', 'look', 'innocent', 'weak', 'young', 'boy', 'forget', 'boy', 'could', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'man', 'lots', 'power', 'LIONS', 'film', 'perception', 'audience', 'know', 'what', 'true', 'not.Walter', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osmet', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'young', 'boy', 'direction', 'mother', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'Personal', 'Velocity', 'flighty', 'incredibly', 'selfish', 'opportunity', 'meet', 'new', 'man', 'Walter', 'off', 'great-uncles', 'spend', 'summer', 'them.Those', 'men', 'are', 'named', 'Garth', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Little', 'Voice', 'Hub', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Apostle', 'rumor', 'have', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'Walter', 'mother', 'think', 'buddy-', 'buddy', 'maybe', 'small', 'fortune', 'could', 'one', 'day', 'become', 'theirs', 'Walter', 'summer', 'life', 'summer', 'full', 'crazy', 'adventures', 'giraffe', 'cornfield', 'swashbuckling', 'riveting', 'stories', 'adventure', 'beautiful', 'princesses', 'course', 'lion', 'named', 'Jasmine.SECONDHAND', 'LIONS', 'kind', 'film', 'love', 'Sure', 'light', 'fluffy', 'also', 'filled', 'interesting', 'characters', 'surprises', 'corner', 'fantasy', 'being', 'cartoon', 'farce', 'little', 'bit', 'heart', 'something', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'days', 'true', 'imagination.Of', 'course', 'have', 'minor', 'squabbles', 'film', 'welcome', 'Creating', 'ending', 'far', 'too', 'sentimental', 'far', 'too', 'forced', 'self-discovery', 'want', 'leave', 'characters', 'just', 'be', 'SECONDHAND', 'LIONS', 'just', 'lump', 'giving', 'endless', 'shots', 'older', 'Walter', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'old', 'cop', 'talking', 'past', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'film', 'end', 'keeping', 'guessing', 'alas', 'answer', 'one', 'question', 'rest', 'story', 'Are', 'old', 'stories', 'true', 'Duvall', 'Caine', 'are', 'incredibly', 'charming', 'Garth', 'Hub', 'men', 'more', 'stories', 'tell', 'yet', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'ask', 'have', 'sarcastic', 'wit', 'story', 'further', 'loved', 'scene', 'where', 'Duvall', 'character', 'up', 'teenagers', 'How', 'cocky', 'do', 'young', 'people', 'think', 'are', 'nice', 'be', 'put', 'place', 'man', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'belt', 'Caine', 'score', 'straight', 'man', 'subtle', 'grace', 'how', 'Duvall', 'How', 'characters', 'feel', 'brothers', 'not', 'two', 'men', 'acting.Writer/Director', 'Tim', 'McCanlies', 'Dancer', 'Texas', 'Pop', '81', 'created', 'film', 'watch', 'able', 'enchanting', 'same', 'time', 'rural', 'Texas', 'dustbowl', 'boredom', 'magic', 'hiding', 'corn', 'favorite', 'shot', 'tall', 'giraffe', 'focus', 'flatbed', 'truck', 'loved', 'how', 'incredibly', 'silly', 'thought', 'was.SECONDHAND', 'LIONS', 'trip', 'cinema', 'night', 'curled', 'up', 'warm', 'fire', 'Sure', 'not', 'greatest', 'kinds', 'movies', 'recommend', 'sit', 'down', 'THE', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'BARON', 'MUNCHAUSEN', ""'re"", 'looking', 'safe', 'sweet', 'trip', 'past', 'love', 'run-ins', 'lions', 'give', 'SECONDHAND', 'LION', 'try', '***1/2', '5']",Secondhand Lions

The eye-popping scenes continue happening unexpectedly, namely the rumor about the great-uncles being former bank robbers, the two shooting bullets around salesmen to scare them off, and the revealing of a former love affair.  All turn of events keep audiences questioning: are the circulated rumors a misunderstanding, or are they true criminals?  As audiences continue watching, they discover that few past events are what they originally appear to be.  Such affect keeps them watching interestingly closer.All actors offer their own humor into every word.  Michael Caine and Robert DuVall play wonderful great-uncles.

Bell ""Imzadi""","[38, 39]","Secondhand Lions is a movie for almost the entire family, except for young children who might find it a little slow-moving and possibly boring.  It combines fine acting, a good story, and real values without resorting to sex and profanity.  Basically it is the story of young Walter (Haley Joel Osment), whose immature tart of a mother, Mae (Kyra Sedgwick), dumps him at the home of his two grand-uncles Garth (Michael Caine) & Hub (Robert Duvall).  As she leaves him, she tells him that there is a rumor that they were Mafia hit men and have a fortune hidden.  ""Look for it,"" are her last words as she takes off, ostensibly to go to the court reporting school in Fort Worth.  We eventually learn that she has dumped him before, even in an orphanage.Garth & Hub are eccentrics who shoot at fish in the lake and at the occasional traveling salesmen who come down the road to their house.  Although they are not pleased to have the boy, they accept him.  He is horrified to learn they have no television, no telephone, no air conditioning. One day a lion is delivered to their farm.  They had hoped to hunt and kill the beast, but it is old and lazy and refuses to leave its crate.  So of course they adopt it as a pet. Some relatives who have come to try to weasel themselves into the uncles' will let the lion out, and it finds a home in the cornfield, as close as it can come to a jungle.One night he sees Hub sleepwalking with a toilet plunger, which he brandishes like a sword.  Garth begins to tell Walter a fantastic story about their youth, in which they were shanghaied from their European travels and commandeered into the French Foreign Legion.  At this point we see the young Hub, magnificently portrayed with great panache by the handsome, mustached Christian Kane in a very energetic performance, as he fights with the Legion, often rescuing the less athletic Garth.  Afterwards he fights against slavery, falls in love with the beautiful and spunky Princess Jasmine, and battles apparently insurmountable odds to be with her, gaining a fortune in the process.Walter & his uncles grow fond of each other, and an encounter in the general store in which Hub singlehandedly overcomes four young punks armed with knives lends credence to Garth's tale.Mae eventually returns with a sleaze of a boy friend (Nicky Katt) who hits Walter when he refuses to reveal the hiding place of the money. Jasmine, the lion, attacks him to protect Walter.Eventually Mae wants to take Walter home, and he must choose between life with her and life with his uncles.The ending of the movie, which I don't want to reveal, is very satisfying.  Josh Lucas appears briefly as the adult Walter, who has become a successful cartoonist with his strip Walter & Jasmine, based on his and his uncles' lives, as they told it to him.All of the actors did a fine job, although I wish that Kane had been allowed to speak his lines instead of using Caine's voiceover for his scenes.

With Robert Duvall, Michael Caine, and Haley Joel Osment, how could they go wrong?  But there's many a film out there that boasts a multi-talented all-star cast and yet still fails to deliver the goods.SECONDHAND LIONS is not one of them.The story is about young Walter who is just barely in his teens and is sent to live with his two great uncles.  He constantly hears rumors of their hidden treasure that they stole from Al Capone, or took from a wealthy Arab, or obtained through a lawsuit, or...whatever you want to believe.  Throughout the movie, Walter learns from his uncles, Hub and Garth, how to grow into a man and what the truly important things are in life; and Garth and Hub learn from Walter how to enjoy life to the fullest.The drama here is fantastic, and only once does the emotionalism get a little over-the-top (which is why I gave it four stars instead of five).  The acting is fantastic.  In this adventurous film you'll be reminded of images of INDIANA JONES, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, among many others....I wish every goofball (i.e. summer blockbuster) filmmaker in Hollywood -- you know, the ones that think creative filmmaking means having alot of CGI characters jumping around on skyscrapers and fighting villains in Power Ranger suits -- would simply sit down and watch SECONDHAND LIONS.

789552,A1ZU731IFILMV4,B0000YTP02,"Demonic Kelvin ""Dark""","[9, 11]","Secondhand Lions is the kind of movie that will give you the entertainment that you just need to release your tension besides gaining some pretty educational lessons from it. This movie is nice to watch and its story's good enough. It is amazing that this movie is acted by some remarkable actors such as Michael Caine, Robert Duvall and the young Haley Joel Osment.Duvall and Caine potray as the McCann brothers that dwell in the rural Texas after being dissapear for over 40 years. Their lifestyle are a little strange and they don't wish to be disturbed by anyone. They are said to have endless supply of cash and have a very mysterious history during their young age. Some say they are bank robbers during the 20's and 30's. They might also be just what they said they were about the travelling around the continents(Africa,Shanghai and many more places)and about the lovely Princess Jasmine that Hub(Duvall) met and also the story about the very powerful Sheikh in Africa. Then, Mae(Sedgwick), Walter's(Osment)irresponsible mother left him at his uncles house(McCann brothers)for the summer holidays where Walter just wished not to go.Walter then learns that his uncles aren't just ordinary people (seeing how they treat those travelling salesman by shooting them away) and he finds out about their background. After he found a picture of a beautiful women in a box, he's more eager to unravel their mysterious history. He keeps on asking his Uncle Garth about them and as day goes on, he managed to know more and more. Finally, he managed to find out everything about his 2 uncles, BUT the thing is, IS IT TRUE like what his Uncle Garth said ?In the meantime while he discovering their past, he gets some really educational speech from his Uncle Hub. Some really wonderful speech that I like the most are ""A man should believe in what is worth to believe although it might not be true"" and ""Money and power, power and money means nothing to everyone. Only virtues that are important for a man"". This lessons are indeed educational for the young Walter because he has been around his mother's LIES all the time and he doesn't know what to really believe in.At the end, when Walter's mother comes to bring him home, he tells his mother that he wished to stay with his uncles for a long period of time(at least till after he's through with college). He feels that he could learn much more by staying with his uncles rather than with his mother. The ending is wonderful when the adult Walter receives a call from a syerif telling him that his 2 uncles meet an accident while flying their plane and passed away together in their very old age(over 90 years old).Walter then gets his uncles' will saying that he gets all their money and then, the Sheikh's grandson came after the news reported about the McCann brothers. The Sheikh's grandson tells Walter that he had heard stories about the great McCann brothers from his grandfather. I feel that this part of the movie is very important to conclude the true background history of the McCann brothers. This part is also important for Walter to know the truth about his uncles that they were really the person they've said they were and not some criminals.Personally, I prefer this movie very much because everything in this movie is GREAT including the story, ending, soundtracks, the way the actors've brought their character(very appealing) and many more. EXCELLENT! Spend some time and catch this great movie.

I had never heard of such a movie until then.However, I had no idea that this movie would completely blow all my expectations out of the water and into orbit around the Earth but it sure did just that! This is one of the best movies to have come out so far in 2003, a relatively lousy year for movies saved only by ""Finding Nemo"", ""Matrix Reloaded"" and ""X-Men United"". It is definitely on its way to becoming one of the top 10 movies of the year and it definitely deserves so.(Warning: Minor Spoilers ahead)The story is a coming of age tale that begins in the Texas countryside in the 1960s with a shy, highly introverted, and near-adolescent boy named Walter who has becoming increasingly distant from his often inept and neglectful mother Mae and is angry with the endless river of lies. One day, Mae tells her son Walter that she's going to a school in Dallas, Texas and drops off her son to a dingy countryside house to stay with his wealthy but eccentric great-uncles Hub and Garth (Mae's uncles) for the summer. The Great-Uncles at first are almost completely unresponsive and somewhat unkind to Walter at first due to their estrangement from Mae but gradually they open up to Walter and then over time, they eventually open up to him and then from there, the Great-Uncles tell him about their stories of what they went through during their younger days during World War I and the adventures that they went through during the immediate years following the war.Walter in return, becomes highly fascinated by their stories of their exotic adventures in Northern Africa and Europe but the whole belief is in danger from a corrupt state official who is accusing them of stealing millions of dollars and is trying to have a warrant for their arrests plus, Hub and Garth's wealth is being sought after by numerous relatives  living within a thousand miles of their home and now Walter is in the tense state of deciding who to believe in: His uncles' story of how they got the large stash of cash from their adventures overseas or the accusations of bank robberies from the police officers.I think that it is so awesome the way ""Secondhand Lions"" blends sadness and tears with laughter and smiles so well.  I haven't seen a movie that has done such a great thing like this in years, that is if ever. The whole story plot while occasionally a bit thin in some areas is very strong. This fills in a gap that I feel is missing in a lot of movies: An excellent and powerful message about who to believe in and how one can re-ignite one's own as well as others' lives as well.

789561,AFITDZEWKJKAM,B0000YTP02,D. Keating,"[1, 1]","Like many other reviewers I did not have high hopes for this film, other than the actors involved. But, Secondhand Lions is a very entertaining family movie. Both Michael Caine and Robert Duval are great playing Walter's crazy relatives who in reality teach this abandoned young man a lot about life.I particularly liked this movie for two reasons. First - it is very entertaining. The movie does a solid job of balancing the humor with the more serious parts. On the serious side the brothers played by Caine and Duval do a tremendous job of teaching the young man about being a man, despite their reservations about helping out. As far as humor goes, I was laughing out loud during multiple scenes. You are sure to enjoy the &quot;shotgun fishing&quot;, highly effective ways of dealing with a salesman (which also involves shotguns), and high adventure stories from the French Foreign Legion, just to name a few.The second reason I like this movie involves the main theme of the plot. Basically, it is about two &quot;misfits&quot; teaching a young boy about becoming a man. Given the lack of male role models in today's society, it is encouraging to see someone tackling this subject in a family movie. It does so without all the killing, loud music, or cussing that you find in way too many modern films.I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an entertaining tale about a young man finding his way in the world.",4,Pleasant Surprise,1082937600,"04 26, 2004",2004,1429,"['many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'film', 'other', 'actors', 'involved', 'Secondhand', 'Lions', 'very', 'entertaining', 'family', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Robert', 'Duval', 'are', 'great', 'playing', 'Walter', 'crazy', 'relatives', 'who', 'reality', 'teach', 'abandoned', 'young', 'man', 'lot', 'life.I', 'particularly', 'liked', 'movie', 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'solid', 'job', 'balancing', 'humor', 'more', 'serious', 'parts', 'serious', 'side', 'brothers', 'played', 'Caine', 'Duval', 'do', 'tremendous', 'job', 'teaching', 'young', 'man', 'being', 'man', 'reservations', 'helping', 'out', 'As', 'far', 'humor', 'was', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'multiple', 'scenes', 'are', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'quot', 'fishing', 'quot', 'highly', 'effective', 'ways', 'dealing', 'salesman', 'also', 'shotguns', 'high', 'adventure', 'stories', 'French', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'just', 'name', 'few.The', 'second', 'reason', 'movie', 'main', 'theme', 'plot', 'Basically', 'two', 'quot', 'misfits', 'quot', 'teaching', 'young', 'boy', 'becoming', 'man', 'Given', 'lack', 'male', 'role', 'models', 'today', 'society', 'encouraging', 'see', 'someone', 'tackling', 'subject', 'family', 'movie', 'so', 'killing', 'loud', 'music', 'cussing', 'find', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'modern', 'films.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'looking', 'entertaining', 'tale', 'young', 'man', 'finding', 'way', 'world']",Secondhand Lions

I had never heard about this movie; never noticed it when it was playing in movie palaces.  Channel surfing the other night (and I can press buttons on a remote with the best of 'em) I ran across this intriguing little gem on cable.  Anything sporting Michael Caine and Robert Duvall (as brothers, if you can believe that) is worth watching; and SECONDHAND LIONS aptly entertains--even if the syrup is a bit sticky.It's a plot that's been cooked before:  A pre-teen goes to stay with wacky, eccentric relatives.  Haley Joel Osment plays the adolescent, and when his manhunting momma dumps him on the doorstep of two great-uncles (Duvall and Caine), circa 1950s Texas boonies, the fun begins.  The brothers are alleged retired big game hunters and adventure seekers, yet the locals believe they are instead retired bank robbers--retired gents sitting on a vast stash of loot.  Predictably, as the story unfolds the once-terrified boy begins to appreciate his shotgun-toting elders; a lasting bond of affection, of family, develops.Are there some drawbacks?  Sure.  The ""flashbacks"" of the brothers as adventuresome youths are cornpone supreme.  Haley Joel Osment is stiff, wooden, and uninspired; he looked like he wanted to split to the nearest Hannah Montana gig.  And the ending was. . .over the top.  (Yet very emotional.)  But come one.  Michael Caine and Robert Duvall make this movie work, and work well; they bring believability, eccentricity, and big-time grit to their roles.  SECONDHAND LIONS may have scooted past me when it made its theatrical run, but I'm sure glad I caught it cable surfing, and recommend it to anyone looking for fun entertainment.--D.

Toss in a gaggle of the most loveable pets (a pig, several dogs and even a she-lion), who bond with Osment in listening to the glorious tales of the early days of the brothers in the French Foreign Legion, and the chemistry is terrific.  Whether the tall tales of the brothers are based on reality or imagination is up to the viewer (and Osment) to decide and one of the many wise bits of philosophy in the movie comes from Caine who feels as long as you believe, then the 'reality' is secondary.  Watching these two old loners gradually grow into a close, caring relationship with the boy is what fell-good family movies are able to do in assisting parents to encourage growth of the heart as well as the mind during those terrifying years of adolescence.

Not having a clue how to take care of a young boy, the two uncles procede about their daily routines and allow Walter to tag along. At first shocked by his uncles odd behavior, such as taking pot shots at traveling salesmen and driving money grubbing relatives insane, Walter comes to enjoy his uncles company, especially the stories of their exploits when they were young that Garth tells him. Finding that his uncles have lived lives full of adventure, love and excitement, Walter joins in their rather eccentric ways as he befriends a lion that the uncles have bought and helps them grow a garden of nothing but corn. The movie leaves it open until the very end whether Hob and Garth actually got their wealth from the adventures in Arabia they claim to have had or from bank robberies. That is a conclusion Walter has to come to before it's ever revealed.A heartwarming movie, Secondhand Lions has a lot of sweetness to be swollowed and might not be for everyone, but is a good movie for family entertainment with some good humor (especially from the over the top stories Garth tells Walter) and should be good for viewers young and old.",4,Good Family Entertainment,1099267200,"11 1, 2004",2004,1490,"['becoming', 'more', 'more', 'difficult', 'find', 'good', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'now', 'days', 'Secondhand', 'Lions', 'entertaining', 'adults', 'children', 'humor', 'heart.Walter', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'dumped', 'summer', 'farm', 'two', 'eccentric', 'supposedly', 'filthy', 'rich', 'uncles', 'Hob', 'Garth', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Not', 'having', 'clue', 'how', 'take', 'care', 'young', 'boy', 'two', 'uncles', 'procede', 'daily', 'routines', 'allow', 'Walter', 'tag', 'along', 'first', 'shocked', 'uncles', 'odd', 'behavior', 'such', 'taking', 'pot', 'shots', 'traveling', 'salesmen', 'driving', 'money', 'grubbing', 'relatives', 'insane', 'Walter', 'enjoy', 'uncles', 'company', 'especially', 'stories', 'exploits', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'Garth', 'Finding', 'uncles', 'have', 'lived', 'lives', 'full', 'adventure', 'love', 'excitement', 'Walter', 'rather', 'eccentric', 'ways', 'lion', 'uncles', 'have', 'bought', 'grow', 'garden', 'nothing', 'corn', 'movie', 'open', 'very', 'end', 'Hob', 'Garth', 'actually', 'got', 'wealth', 'adventures', 'Arabia', 'claim', 'have', 'had', 'bank', 'robberies', 'conclusion', 'Walter', 'come', 'ever', 'revealed.A', 'heartwarming', 'movie', 'Secondhand', 'Lions', 'lot', 'sweetness', 'be', 'swollowed', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'good', 'movie', 'family', 'entertainment', 'good', 'humor', 'especially', 'top', 'stories', 'Garth', 'tells', 'Walter', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'viewers', 'young', 'old']",Secondhand Lions

This movie was better than 'OK' (three stars), so I give it four - but then it lumps itself in with other films I've given four stars, and this one wasn't quite as good (i.e., He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not).  So, I'd say three and half stars, which rounds up to four in this case.  Why?  Well, the ending was a little sappy.  I guess it was intending to show that the stories were valid, but it seemed a little forced.  Also, Osment has officially entered the awkward stage - get ready for lots of squeaky exclamations!

789622,A24D0DENA8N7GH,B0000YTP02,James Sadler,"[1, 2]","I did not see this film in theaters in part because it just looked kind of simplistic and dumb to me. However, a friend of my wife's raved about it so we checked it out this weekend.I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw. Given the pedigree of the actors involved, it was probably a no-brainer that it would be well-acted, even though I'm not a fan of Robert Duvall. But Duvall actually gives a rather restrained performance, which is surprising because he is playing an over-the-top character. Caine is almost underused, but the intent seems to be for his character to fill that role. As we learn, Hub (Robert Duvall) has always been the adventuring thrill-seeker, while Garth (Michael Caine) frequently was just along for the ride.Walter (Haley Joel Osment) is unceremoniously dumped by his mother (Kyra Sedgwick) on his great uncles, Hub and Garth. Hub and Garth apparently disappeared for a forty year period and now have re-emerged in retirement somewhere in Texas. They are rumored to be hiding millions of dollars and a big part of their entertainment each day is the appearance of traveling salesmen whom they generally chase off by shooting at them. Part of Walter's marching orders from his mother are to find out where the money is hidden.Naturally, no one gets along at first, but eventually Walter and his uncles clearly come to love one another as they become his surrogate parents. Garth begins to tell Walter stories of what happened to them over that forty year period, fantastic tales of adventures in the French Foreign Legion, battles with slave traders, and outsmarting a sheik to gain their fortune. He also learns that Hub is deeply troubled by the death of the woman he loved, Jasmine, and Walter must eventually summon the courage to question his intimidating Uncle Hub about what happened to Jasmine.Life has become fairly idyllic for Walter, including becoming the owner of a scruffy old lioness, when his mother reappears with a boyfriend who is determined to find the money. The boyfriend claims to be a private detective who has learned that Hub and Garth are actually bank robbers. Walter is forced to make some tough decisions, along the way drawing inspirations from his uncles who may or may not be what he though they were.Okay, there are a few plot wholes. For one thing, the bulk of the story appears to be taking place in the sixties and Hub and Garth started their adventuring in 1914, on the eve of World War I. Maybe it's actually taking place in the fifties, I don't know my cars well enough to pin a date down based on the models of cars appearing in the film. Regardless, it seems they would at least be in their late teens in 1914. And both act as if they are already well into old age when Walter meets them. Its just real hard to figure out how old they actually are and the timelines just do not seem to work.The ending also stretches disbelief just a little too much, but go with it anyway. Hub and Garth apparently had some fantastic adventures, so why not an ending that places an exclamation point on those adventures? Just go with it, okay? Don't do what I typically do and start analyzing every thing, you'll ruin it for yourself.As noted, the acting throughout is first rate. The story is one of those that can bring a tear to your eye (unless you're a total cynic you'll probably at least get a lump in your throat), and you'll probably be amazed at some of the scenes that appear during Garth's story-telling sequences. This was probably a film that had a relatively modest budget, but they do a great job evoking scenes that are apparently from Europe, Morocco, and other far away lands. Not everyone will like it, just take a look at some of the previous reviews, but I think most people will find it to be a fun, enjoyable film.Heck, after having rented it, I'm planning to buy it now.",4,"Not Perfect, But it's Fun",1076284800,"02 9, 2004",2004,3847,"['did', 'not', 'see', 'film', 'theaters', 'part', 'just', 'looked', 'kind', 'simplistic', 'dumb', 'However', 'friend', 'wife', 'raved', 'checked', 'out', 'weekend.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'what', 'saw', 'Given', 'pedigree', 'actors', 'involved', 'was', 'probably', 'no-brainer', 'would', 'be', 'well-acted', 'even', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Duvall', 'actually', 'rather', 'restrained', 'performance', 'surprising', 'playing', 'over-the-top', 'character', 'Caine', 'almost', 'underused', 'intent', 'be', 'character', 'fill', 'role', 'learn', 'Hub', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'always', 'been', 'adventuring', 'thrill-seeker', 'Garth', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'frequently', 'was', 'just', 'along', 'ride.Walter', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'unceremoniously', 'dumped', 'mother', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'great', 'uncles', 'Hub', 'Garth', 'Hub', 'Garth', 'apparently', 'disappeared', 'forty', 'year', 'period', 'now', 'have', 're-emerged', 'retirement', 'somewhere', 'Texas', 'are', 'rumored', 'be', 'hiding', 'millions', 'dollars', 'big', 'part', 'entertainment', 'day', 'appearance', 'traveling', 'salesmen', 'whom', 'generally', 'chase', 'off', 'shooting', 'Part', 'Walter', 'marching', 'orders', 'mother', 'are', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'money', 'hidden.Naturally', 'one', 'along', 'first', 'eventually', 'Walter', 'uncles', 'clearly', 'come', 'love', 'one', 'become', 'surrogate', 'parents', 'Garth', 'tell', 'Walter', 'stories', 'what', 'happened', 'over', 'forty', 'year', 'period', 'fantastic', 'tales', 'adventures', 'French', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'slave', 'traders', 'outsmarting', 'sheik', 'gain', 'fortune', 'also', 'Hub', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'death', 'woman', 'loved', 'Jasmine', 'Walter', 'must', 'eventually', 'summon', 'courage', 'question', 'intimidating', 'Uncle', 'Hub', 'what', 'happened', 'Jasmine.Life', 'become', 'fairly', 'idyllic', 'Walter', 'including', 'becoming', 'owner', 'scruffy', 'old', 'lioness', 'when', 'mother', 'reappears', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'determined', 'find', 'money', 'boyfriend', 'be', 'private', 'detective', 'who', 'learned', 'Hub', 'Garth', 'are', 'actually', 'bank', 'robbers', 'Walter', 'forced', 'make', 'tough', 'decisions', 'way', 'drawing', 'inspirations', 'uncles', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'were.Okay', 'are', 'few', 'plot', 'wholes', 'one', 'thing', 'bulk', 'story', 'be', 'taking', 'place', 'sixties', 'Hub', 'Garth', 'started', 'adventuring', '1914', 'eve', 'World', 'War', 'Maybe', 'actually', 'taking', 'place', 'fifties', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'cars', 'well', 'enough', 'pin', 'date', 'down', 'based', 'models', 'cars', 'appearing', 'film', 'Regardless', 'would', 'least', 'be', 'late', 'teens', '1914', 'act', 'are', 'already', 'well', 'old', 'age', 'when', 'Walter', 'just', 'real', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'old', 'actually', 'are', 'timelines', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'work.The', 'ending', 'also', 'disbelief', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'go', 'anyway', 'Hub', 'Garth', 'apparently', 'had', 'fantastic', 'adventures', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'ending', 'exclamation', 'point', 'adventures', 'Just', 'go', 'okay', 'Do', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'typically', 'do', 'start', 'analyzing', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'ruin', 'yourself.As', 'noted', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'story', 'one', 'can', 'bring', 'tear', 'eye', ""'re"", 'total', 'cynic', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'least', 'get', 'lump', 'throat', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'amazed', 'scenes', 'appear', 'Garth', 'story-telling', 'sequences', 'was', 'probably', 'film', 'had', 'relatively', 'modest', 'budget', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'evoking', 'scenes', 'are', 'apparently', 'Europe', 'Morocco', 'other', 'far', 'away', 'Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'like', 'just', 'take', 'look', 'previous', 'reviews', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'film.Heck', 'having', 'rented', ""'m"", 'planning', 'buy', 'now']",Secondhand Lions

It teaches us that the best is yet to come.  Haley Joel Osment (the wonder boy actor from ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""A.I."") is dumped on his two eccentric, great uncles who live in the past.  They amaze the boy with stories of when they were forced into the French Foreign Legion and rescued a Princess from a Sheik.  How much of it is real and how much is exaggeration?Osment teaches his uncles that they still have a lot of living to do.  First of all, they are faced with ""fatherhood.""  They've been saddled with raising Osment.  Osment is the child that the uncles never had.  Duvall lost his wife and child during childbirth.  In a way, the uncles are Osment's secondhand fathers and he is their secondhand son.  Both men are aging lions who begin to experience life anew when Osment arrives.An old lion from a zoo arrives through the mail.  This is another secondhand lion that nobody wants.  But Osment wants him, just as he wants and needs his uncles.  Through the love of Osment, both the lion and the uncles become what they once were:  roaring lions, yearning to live life to the fullest.Osment eventually learns that the stories his uncles told him weren't as exaggerated as he had suspected and they really lived great lives.  This movie reminded me a lot of the film ""Big Fish"":  A grown man attempts to learn who is father really was while fearingthat all his life stories have been lies.""Secondhand Lions"" made me laugh and it made me cry.

The DVD has lots of features including an alternate ending longer than the one that was actually used.  I am still not sure which ending I liked best.This is TRULY a family movie that the whole family will just adore.  Walter (Haley Osment) has one of those moms who looks pretty but is about as substantial as a fistful of sand.  Under the pretense that she is going to a court reporting school and can't take care of Walter, she drops him off with his eccentric, reclusive and rich uncles Garth (Michael Caine) and Hub (Robert Duvall). Everyone knows that the two old coots have tons of money but no one agrees on how they got it. Though most think that they robbed banks in their youth, Garth spins a beautiful tale to Walter of how they were abducted into the French Foreign Legion and stayed on in Morocco to fight wars and win their fortune.  They spend their time target practicing on traveling salesmen until Walter convinces them to start spending some of their money.  From vegetable gardens to second hand lions, they have a whale of a summer getting to know each other.  Walter is smitten with his uncles and they with him. When Walter's mother returns, he will be forced to choose whether to believe the fanciful stories of his uncles that are so inextricably tied up with who they are and their relationship to each other or to believe the more realistic sounding stories of the envious relations with disastrous results.Don't miss the alternate/deleted scenes either.  There were a lot of side stories or running jokes that had been intended and then were mostly cut out.

It's good, clean, ""feel-good"" entertainment. Some of it is hokey for sure but the cast makes it delightful. Of course Cain and Duval are good but the boy ""Walter"" is great too...as are most of the supporting cast.BUT...Amazon describes it as a 2-disk set but it's only one disk. The disk itself shows bonus material (deleted scenes, etc.) on the menu but there is none. The disk is marked ""Disk 1"" so you might expect two, eh? We returned the first but Amazon said they could not replace it for whatever reason (It is sold and fulfilled by Amazon). So we ordered another. Same thing...only one disk.  I suspect it was some kind of special purchase of disk #1 because there is not typical ""seal"" on the package. It is wrapped and obviously new and plays fine.For $3.99 shipped free with Prime (we love Prime) it's still a good deal and I highly recommend Secondhand Lions if you like pleasant, clean entertainment.**Blu-ray Review: 01-28-2014The BD version for about $7.00 DOES contain some very good bonus material, even though the product description says it doesn't (Amazon ???

789649,AU3GYRAKBUAEU,B0000YTP02,Jon Norris,"[6, 6]","Secondhand Lions was a pleasing watch for me. Aside from the fact that it had two of our greatest actors, Michael Caine and Robert Duvall, it was simply a well done movie all the way around.The story of two old bachelors ending up taking care of a teenaged boy dumped on them by his gold-digging mother could have gone a number of different directions, from comic to tragic. This film had a good balance of both, and the whole range in between.As a male growing up in this culture, I can identify with the lack of ritual, leadership, or healthy male bonding. Tribal cultures had a structure and process for a person's development through the stages of life, and it tended to be relevant to one's actual life. We are in a culture with no respect for Nature, other people, or ourselves, and our souls cry out for such things.Many people may find it campy or corny or whatever, but the underlying theme in this movie is that boys need to have some sort of initiation into manhood by a man (or better yet, men) with knowledge and experience of life and death. This film makes a good stab at showing how that can happen in little ways when individual men stand up and make a difference in a boy's life. It also shows how men whose prime is past are still important and vital to society. All the battles worth winning are not just in wars. Some of the most important are right there on your own doorstep.I was really looking forward to seeing this as I was intrigued by the possibilities of Duvall and Caine on screen together. I was not disappointed. (Have those two ever done anything bad? If so, I haven't seen it.)I watched it on the same day as Whale Rider, and the two make a pretty good set.

789651,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B0000YTP02,Joseph Haschka,"[2, 3]","SECONDHAND LIONS is a film that one may enjoy for its quirkiness, or hate for its cuteness. I fall into the former group.As the film opens, young Walter (Haley Joel Osmont) is deposited unannounced on the rural doorstep of his bachelor grand uncles, Garth (Michael Caine) and Hub (Robert Duvall), by his single-mother Mae (Kyra Sedgwick). Mae is ostensibly off to the big city to attend Court Reporting School, but she has a history of lying to her son. Garth and Hub have recently surfaced after a forty-year absence. It's rumored that the two eccentric geezers have millions of dollars hidden somewhere on their property. Traveling salesman and relatives all want a piece of the action, and Garth and Hub habitually drive the former off with shotguns. Mae hopes that Walter's stay with the two will mature the boy, who's a bit of a wimp. And his secondary assignment is, of course, to find the treasure. Mae herself is not Good Housekeeping's role model for Mom. As she strides towards her surprised uncles (who are out in a boat shooting fish), one asks the other, &quot;Did you order a hooker?&quot;. Enough said.Hub is an older and much crustier version of Duvall's Gus McCrae seen in 1989's LONESOME DOVE. When Hub advises Walter on what it is that a boy his age should believe in, it's vintage Gus. But this is a good thing since McCrae was, in my opinion, the greatest role of Duvall's distinguished career.I can't help but feel that Caine was miscast. It's not that he's bad at it, but his Garth persona pales to a nondescript blandness beside Duvall's Hub. This is Duvall's vehicle; no doubt about it. Garth has two purposes in the plot - to act as Hub's straight man in the now, and to tell Walter the tale of Hub's past. As Garth relates, both fought in the French Foreign Legion at the outbreak of WWI. After that, they remained in Africa, where Hub fought slavers and won and lost a desert beauty, Princess Jasmine.At one point, Hub and Garth acquire ownership of a &quot;secondhand lion&quot;, presumably purchased from a circus. The beast is old and pretty much useless, much like Hub sees himself at this late stage in his life after decades of living on the edge.A significant part of SECONDHAND LIONS involves flashbacks that accompany Garth's tale of his and his brother's swashbuckling past. These scenes, in which Hub and Garth are played by younger actors, resemble the comic book adventures designed in bygone eras for young males. This isn't unreasonable since the setting of the plot's &quot;now&quot; is apparently in the late 50s or early 60s.Despite my misgivings about Caine's inclusion in the cast - perhaps Tommy Lee Jones, Duvall's co-star in LONESOME DOVE, might have better suited - and an ending that seemed overly-contrived and which literally dropped out of the sky, I liked this film for its offbeat and whimsical storyline that proved to be an effective tale of Growing Up. I wish I'd had uncles like Garth and Hub.

Turkish SoldierI'm not much of a critic of the technical aspects of DVDs, as many other reviewers are.  I am far more interested in the story and the entertainment value of the film.  This is a superb story about a couple of aged iconoclasts, brothers Garth and Hub (Michael Caine and Robert Duvall) and their grand nephew, Walter (Haley Joel Osment), whose mother Mae (Kyra Sedgewick), a self-centered, shallow woman who is more interested in money and her boyfriends than her son, dumps Walter on the uncles supposedly while she attends a school in Texas, but who is really in Las Vegas getting a new boyfriend who, in turn, is interested mainly in the cache of money the uncles have stashed.This is a great story, involving the uncles homebuilt airplane, their history of travels with the Foreign Legion, First World War adventures, Africa, and a supposed background as bank robbers.The wonderful actors, Michael Caine and Robert Duvall, share the same screen, an event in itself worth watching if nothing else, but for added measure the wonderful presence of Haley Joel Osment, who plays his part flawlessly, as well as the zoo of animal actors involved in the story, make for an extraordinary production.

789659,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B0000YTP02,Kenya Starflight,"[1, 1]","I have to admit, I was skeptical when I first watched this movie.  I had little to no idea what it was about (there wasn't a great deal of promotion for it if I remember correctly), and I'm not the biggest fan of Haley Joel Osment.  I do love seeing Michael Caine work his acting chops, however, and the movie was recommended to me by a family member, so I decided to give it a shot.  And in the end, I'm so glad I did, because this is one of the best live-action family films of the '00s.How to describe this movie?  Think of it as ""Grumpy Old Men"" meets ""The Princess Bride,"" with a dash of ""Stand By Me"" -- the hilarity of two old codgers butting heads with everyone around them and each other combined with an epic Arabian-style adventure of sheiks, princesses, and treasure, topped off with a thoughtful coming-of-age story.Set in the early 1960s, the movie follows Walter (Osment), a quiet, bookish boy who's not at all pleased to be dumped in the care of his ornery great-uncles for the summer while his floozy mother goes off to party.  Said uncles, Garth and Hub, can most charitably be described as eccentric -- their idea of a good time is shooting at traveling salesmen, catfish fishing with shotguns, and buying a lion for target practice (though said lion ends up being too old and lazy to shoot and ends up becoming a pet for Walter).  Despite a rocky start, Walter and his uncles begin to warm to each other, and Walter finds himself caught up in their various escapades and misadventures.  And when Garth begins to tell Walter the story of their past -- a story of being shanghaied by the French Foreign Legion and becoming swept up in an epic adventure in North Africa and Arabia -- Walter begins to learn some important truths about his life... about what it takes to become a man, and on the importance of finding something to believe in.The film has a rather leisurely pace, which might be annoying to fans of more action-packed films like ""The Avengers"" or ""Transformers.""  But this works to the films advantage, letting events and characters unfold and develop rather than rushing things for the sake of plot.  The film has a timeless, classic feel despite the 50's-60's-ish setting, and even modern viewers are sure to find something to relate to.  And the flashbacks to Garth and Hub's African adventures have the feel of an epic serial adventure, almost like ""Indiana Jones"" or the aforementioned ""Princess Bride.""  The juxtaposition of mid-century Texas and turn-of-the-century Africa/Arabia could have clashed horribly, but somehow the transitions between times are clear without being jarring, and there's no drop in quality between scenes either.The acting in this film is superb as well.  Osment has drawn some criticism due to the fact that he was going through puberty at the time of filming (you can even hear his voice cracking several times), but this just adds to the realism -- he comes across as a boy on the cusp of his transition to adulthood, searching for some stability in his tumultuous life.  Given that most ""teenagers"" in modern films are just twenty-somethings with young-looking faces, I appreciated this bit of realism.  Michael Caine and Robert Duvall both do fantastic jobs as the cantankerous uncles, with Duvall the gruffer of the two and Caine somewhat more laid-back but still not one to mess with or underestimate.  Most of the other characters are minor at best, but they all do excellent jobs in their roles and bring their characters to life.  (The sole exception being a child actor at the very end of the film, but I tend to cut young children just a bit of slack when it comes to acting...)The DVD of the film comes with a slew of deleted scenes as well.  Most of these would have detracted from the film had they been included, and I agree with the decision to cut them (the ""Santa Robbers"" subplot was rather silly and unnecessary).  But the extended ""corn-harvesting"" scene was funny enough that I wish it had been included in the film proper, and I actually like the alternate ending better -- it tied up various plot threads more neatly, and gave more closure to the story of Walt, Garth, and Hub.  Still, at least the alternate ending is viewable for those who wish to see it, instead of permanently relegated to the cutting room floor.A wonderful family film, with equal parts coming-of-age drama and epic adventure that should please fans of ""The Princess Bride,"" ""Stand By Me,"" and ""Grumpy Old Men.""

789663,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B0000YTP02,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[1, 1]","SOME SPOILERSI admit it. I cried at the end of SECONDHAND LIONS. This warm and amazingly touching story struck a deep chord inside me. In terms of ""Family Values"" this film is exemplary.Young Walter (later ""Walt"") is a boy on the verge of becoming a man in 1962 Texas. His sweet but careless and flighty mother, Mae (Kyra Sedgwick) has a long history of dropping him off ""for two weeks or a month or two or three months"" with relatives or at orphanages while she pursues her own life's dreams, which boil down to mostly finding a husband (employment status unimportant; criminal record expected; domestic violence unavoidable).Having run out of siblings and Sisters of Mercy, Mae takes Walter to spend the summer with her two great-uncles, Hub (Robert Duval) and Garth (Michael Caine). When Walt arrives the two old men are sitting on the front porch of their falling-down house, shotguns at the ready, waiting for traveling salesmen. They accept ""the kid"" without comment, wave off his inquiries about TV and telephones, and commence shooting at every widget salesman that pulls up to the door. Walt is terrified, and tries to run off, only to discover that Mae has lied to him yet again regarding her whereabouts. Defeated, he returns to Hub and Garth, who, much to their credit, welcome him back and treat him not as a child or an unwanted houseguest, but as an equal.Walt awakens one night to find Hub armed with a plunger, swordfighting in his sleep. Used by now to the unexpected from his eccentric uncles, bemused but not afraid, he inquires of Garth exactly what is going on. Garth begins to spin a fantastical tall tale of the two brothers joining the Foreign Legion and fighting the Sheiks of Araby. In colorful, entertaining, action-packed sequences, the details of Garth's stories are played out in Walt's mind.As the stories unfold, Walt learns that his uncles are fabulously wealthy men who traversed the world in search of adventure in their young years, but now they're ""all used up."" Walt discovers that Hub has loved and lost his wife, the beautiful Arabian princess, Jasmine, and that his heart is forever broken.As Hub and Garth unlock Walter's imagination his own buoyant energy revitalizes them. At first they keep it within bounds. They start a vegetable garden. They stop shooting at visitors. Then their long-dormant madcap energy takes over. They buy a secondhand lion from the circus as a pet for ""the kid"" (he names her ""Jasmine""). Hub purchases an old biplane (neither brother is a licensed pilot). After Hub singlehandedly fights off a pack of hoodlums, he gives them his famous, ""What Every Boy Needs To Know About Becoming A Man"" speech. They go off, chastened. Walt, who misses the moment, makes his uncle swear to live long enough to give him the speech. The stories continue, wonderful stories full of honor and bravery, and loyalty and love. Are they true?  They don't have to be true in order for us to believe them.We never actually hear ""The Speech"" itself, but SECONDHAND LIONS is the speech personified---Simply this:  ""REALLY Live.""Amazingly, as the ""Extras"" tell us, SECONDHAND LIONS took over ten years to be produced. Screenwriter/Director Tim McCanlies based this story on his own life growing up in Texas, not so much in fact, as in sensibility.

Bernabo,"[3, 3]","I watched &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot; fearing that like so many movies all the best parts were already in the trailer and this 2003 film would be a disappointment.  Instead, I was happy to see that writer-director Tim McCanlies's film exceeded expectations.  The story begins with a man named Walter (Josh Lucas) getting a phone call from a sheriff about his uncles.  It sounds like bad news but before we can find out we have dissolved into the past where Walter is now a 12-year-old boy (Haley Joel Osment) who is being dumped by his flighty mother (Kyra Sedgwick) on two uncles he never knew he had.They are actually his great-uncles, Garth (Michael Caine) and Hub (Robert Duvall), and while his mother insists that he has to do this because she is going off to court reporting school she keeps talking about the fact that these two old guys have got a lot of money buried someplace on the farm and either he can find out where it is or become so beloved by them that they will remember him in their will.  There is another set of relatives who come for the weekend in their Sunday go to meeting clothes and they are not happy to see any competition.  As for Garth and Hub, they like to sit on the front porch and shoot their shotguns at the salesman that come along and there are a lot of those, because it seems everybody knows that the two old coots have a lot of money and their own theory about how they got their hands on it in the first place.There are no surprises here in that we know the young boy and the two old men are going to change each other.  When one salesman actually has the nerve to come back and face those shotguns a second time it is Walter who suggests maybe they should find out what the guy is selling.  That marks the beginning of a lot of changes as Garth and Hub start to buy a lot of things from seeds (mostly corn apparently) to a giraffe and, as the title indicates, a used lion.  Actually a used lioness, who becomes the pet that Walter never had (&quot;Secondhand Giraffe&quot; does not have the same sense of flair apparently).Most of the best parts of this film have Garth and Hub engaging in their eccentricities.  They like to use their shotguns to fish and when a bunch of young hotheads try to pick a fight Hub at least is more than willing to show them the error of their ways (he also gives them another chance after showing them the correct way to use a knife).  For his part Garth spends time now and then telling Walter the story behind Hub's habit of sleepwalking in the middle of the night.  The story has to do with the young Garth (Kevin Haberer) and Hub (Christian Kane, a familiar face from the televison's &quot;Angel&quot;), who ended up in the French Foreign Legion and had some rather unbelievable adventures with a beautiful woman named Jasmine (Emmanuelle Vaugier) and a dastardly Sheik (Adam Ozturk).The story might be unbelievable, but Walter has been getting bits and pieces of Hub's special speech that he always gives to young men.  Walter is not old enough to get the whole speech yet, but the key part is apparently that being able to believe in something is important, even if what you believe in is not true.  Of course the climax of this film involves young Walter coming to understand this great truth.  This helps the message of this coming of age film work for youngsters watching the film who have neither a secondhand lion nor a pair of eccentric uncles in their lives.While getting used to Haley Joel Osment's deeper voice is going to prove difficult for some people, the chief joy here is watching Duvall act just a bit nut and Caine lay on the American accent.  Duvall is the most eccentric of the pair but Caine has this nice ability to manipulate his brother while still seeming to play the second fiddle.  There is a rather neat payoff to what happens to Walter when he grows up as a result of this rather unique childhood but the film really does not have time to let us enjoy that at the end of the film.  It will, however, compel you to watch the credits for a few additional tidbits.",4,Michael Caine and Robert Duval help Haley Joel grow up,1079654400,"03 19, 2004",2004,4071,"['watched', 'quot', 'Secondhand', 'Lions', 'quot', 'fearing', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'best', 'parts', 'were', 'already', 'trailer', '2003', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'disappointment', 'Instead', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'writer-director', 'Tim', 'McCanlies', 'film', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'story', 'man', 'named', 'Walter', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'getting', 'phone', 'call', 'sheriff', 'uncles', 'bad', 'news', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'have', 'dissolved', 'past', 'where', 'Walter', 'now', '12-year-old', 'boy', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'who', 'being', 'dumped', 'flighty', 'mother', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'two', 'uncles', 'never', 'knew', 'had.They', 'are', 'actually', 'great-uncles', 'Garth', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Hub', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'mother', 'do', 'going', 'off', 'court', 'reporting', 'school', 'talking', 'fact', 'two', 'old', 'guys', 'have', 'got', 'lot', 'money', 'buried', 'someplace', 'farm', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'become', 'so', 'beloved', 'will', 'remember', 'will', 'set', 'relatives', 'who', 'come', 'weekend', 'Sunday', 'go', 'meeting', 'clothes', 'are', 'not', 'happy', 'see', 'competition', 'Garth', 'Hub', 'like', 'sit', 'front', 'porch', 'shoot', 'shotguns', 'salesman', 'come', 'along', 'are', 'lot', 'everybody', 'two', 'old', 'coots', 'have', 'lot', 'money', 'own', 'theory', 'how', 'got', 'hands', 'first', 'are', 'surprises', 'here', 'know', 'young', 'boy', 'two', 'old', 'men', 'are', 'going', 'change', 'other', 'When', 'one', 'salesman', 'actually', 'nerve', 'come', 'back', 'face', 'shotguns', 'second', 'time', 'Walter', 'who', 'maybe', 'should', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'guy', 'selling', 'beginning', 'lot', 'changes', 'Garth', 'Hub', 'start', 'buy', 'lot', 'things', 'seeds', 'mostly', 'corn', 'apparently', 'giraffe', 'title', 'used', 'lion', 'Actually', 'used', 'lioness', 'who', 'pet', 'Walter', 'never', 'had', 'quot', 'Secondhand', 'Giraffe', 'quot', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'sense', 'flair', 'apparently', '.Most', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'have', 'Garth', 'Hub', 'engaging', 'eccentricities', 'like', 'use', 'shotguns', 'fish', 'when', 'bunch', 'young', 'hotheads', 'try', 'pick', 'fight', 'Hub', 'least', 'more', 'willing', 'show', 'error', 'ways', 'also', 'chance', 'showing', 'correct', 'way', 'use', 'knife', 'part', 'Garth', 'time', 'now', 'then', 'telling', 'Walter', 'story', 'Hub', 'habit', 'sleepwalking', 'middle', 'night', 'story', 'do', 'young', 'Garth', 'Kevin', 'Haberer', 'Hub', 'Christian', 'Kane', 'familiar', 'face', 'televison', 'quot', 'Angel', 'quot', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'French', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'had', 'rather', 'unbelievable', 'adventures', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'named', 'Jasmine', 'Emmanuelle', 'Vaugier', 'dastardly', 'Sheik', 'Adam', 'Ozturk', '.The', 'story', 'might', 'be', 'unbelievable', 'Walter', 'been', 'getting', 'bits', 'pieces', 'Hub', 'special', 'speech', 'always', 'young', 'men', 'Walter', 'not', 'old', 'enough', 'get', 'whole', 'speech', 'yet', 'key', 'part', 'apparently', 'being', 'able', 'believe', 'something', 'important', 'even', 'what', 'believe', 'not', 'true', 'course', 'climax', 'film', 'young', 'Walter', 'coming', 'understand', 'great', 'truth', 'message', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'work', 'youngsters', 'watching', 'film', 'who', 'have', 'secondhand', 'lion', 'pair', 'eccentric', 'uncles', 'lives.While', 'getting', 'used', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'deeper', 'voice', 'going', 'prove', 'difficult', 'people', 'chief', 'joy', 'here', 'watching', 'Duvall', 'act', 'just', 'bit', 'nut', 'Caine', 'lay', 'American', 'accent', 'Duvall', 'most', 'eccentric', 'pair', 'Caine', 'nice', 'ability', 'manipulate', 'brother', 'still', 'seeming', 'play', 'second', 'fiddle', 'rather', 'neat', 'payoff', 'what', 'Walter', 'when', 'up', 'result', 'rather', 'unique', 'childhood', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'let', 'enjoy', 'end', 'film', 'will', 'however', 'compel', 'watch', 'credits', 'few', 'additional', 'tidbits']",Secondhand Lions

Its just a great movie to watch with the family, young and old can enjoy it.

The boy tries to find out about his uncles' mysterious past - are they really criminals sitting on a treasure on their land, as some say?

789685,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B0000YTP02,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[0, 1]","This movie proves that you can have adventure, action and humor with but a PG rating. There are a few places where the images may be a bit disturbing, such as when Garth McCann (Michael Caine) and Hub McCann (Robert Duvall) shoot at salesmen that have arrived at their front step uninvited. They generally miss; as it turns out they are great shots, even with shotguns. Very young family members may find some of the scenes a bit too violent or threatening; children eight and above should find this movie funny and even touching. Adults especially will like the interplay between veteran actors Caine and Duvall and relative newcomer Haley Joel Osment playing their grand-nephew Walter.Walter ends up with his eccentric and, as it turns out, wealthy, pair of great-uncles when his mother Mae (Kyra Sedgwick) dumps him. She is supposedly on her way to court reporter school but, as Walter soon discovers, the school is another if his mother's frequent lies.At first Walter's uncles appear bizarre, and a bit scary. However, as the movie progresses it turns out they just want to be left alone and are more normal than they first appear, though they are definitely eccentric. As an example, their favorite method of fishing involves shotguns.Walter soon discovers there is much more to his uncles than first appears. Uncle Garth tells Walter their story throughout the first portion of the movie in a series of flashbacks. We discover that Garth and Hub have been in multiple wars, principally in Africa as members of the French Foreign Legion. Or have they? The stories all seem nearly cartoonish and larger-than-life. Given Walter's history with his mother's lies, Walter and we have a hard time believing which of the multiple stories about his uncles is true. Another part of the storyline is the source of his uncle's wealth and where that wealth is kept. All these issues are resolved to the audience's satisfaction by the end of the movie.At first a viewer might be put off by the nearly fairy tale fashion in which the story is told. Consider that Walter becomes a cartoonist as an adult, and the story is essentially a flashback for Walter. Our memories as children are often biased, with the rough edges smoothed and events that did not fit completely eliminated. Thus some of the scenes of the uncle's adventures are more like a B-movie than modern cinema, but Walter was a boy in 1960s Texas, with memories to match. The images of the movie fit Walter's viewpoint.The stars of this movie are Caine and Duvall. Osment gets very little chance to do real acting until near the end of the movie. Most of the rest of the movie Osment is in awe of his adventuresome uncles and his acting is kept principally to facial expressions. Caine and Duvall, on the other hand, act as they appear, curmudgeonly and eccentric. Yet, they are honorable and ethical in their own strange way.I recommend this movie as a family movie. No blood, minimal violence, with few special effects, yet enough humor to keep all but the most jaded movie viewer smiling.",4,Family Adventure (UMD Mini for PSP),1159056000,"09 24, 2006",2006,3047,"['movie', 'can', 'have', 'adventure', 'action', 'humor', 'PG', 'rating', 'are', 'few', 'places', 'where', 'images', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'such', 'when', 'Garth', 'McCann', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Hub', 'McCann', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'shoot', 'salesmen', 'have', 'arrived', 'front', 'step', 'uninvited', 'generally', 'miss', 'out', 'are', 'great', 'shots', 'even', 'shotguns', 'Very', 'young', 'family', 'members', 'may', 'find', 'scenes', 'bit', 'too', 'violent', 'threatening', 'children', 'eight', 'above', 'should', 'find', 'movie', 'funny', 'even', 'touching', 'Adults', 'especially', 'will', 'like', 'interplay', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Caine', 'Duvall', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'playing', 'grand-nephew', 'Walter.Walter', 'up', 'eccentric', 'out', 'wealthy', 'pair', 'great-uncles', 'when', 'mother', 'Mae', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'supposedly', 'way', 'court', 'reporter', 'school', 'Walter', 'soon', 'discovers', 'school', 'mother', 'frequent', 'lies.At', 'first', 'Walter', 'uncles', 'appear', 'bizarre', 'bit', 'scary', 'However', 'movie', 'out', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'are', 'more', 'normal', 'first', 'appear', 'are', 'definitely', 'eccentric', 'example', 'favorite', 'method', 'fishing', 'involves', 'shotguns.Walter', 'soon', 'discovers', 'much', 'more', 'uncles', 'first', 'Uncle', 'Garth', 'tells', 'Walter', 'story', 'first', 'portion', 'movie', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'discover', 'Garth', 'Hub', 'have', 'been', 'multiple', 'wars', 'principally', 'Africa', 'members', 'French', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'have', 'stories', 'seem', 'nearly', 'cartoonish', 'larger-than-life', 'Given', 'Walter', 'history', 'mother', 'lies', 'Walter', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'multiple', 'stories', 'uncles', 'true', 'part', 'storyline', 'source', 'uncle', 'wealth', 'where', 'wealth', 'kept', 'issues', 'are', 'resolved', 'audience', 'satisfaction', 'end', 'movie.At', 'first', 'viewer', 'might', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'nearly', 'fairy', 'tale', 'fashion', 'story', 'told', 'Consider', 'Walter', 'cartoonist', 'adult', 'story', 'essentially', 'flashback', 'Walter', 'memories', 'children', 'are', 'often', 'biased', 'rough', 'edges', 'smoothed', 'events', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'completely', 'eliminated', 'Thus', 'scenes', 'uncle', 'adventures', 'are', 'more', 'B-movie', 'modern', 'cinema', 'Walter', 'was', 'boy', '1960s', 'Texas', 'memories', 'match', 'images', 'movie', 'fit', 'Walter', 'viewpoint.The', 'stars', 'movie', 'are', 'Caine', 'Duvall', 'Osment', 'very', 'little', 'chance', 'do', 'real', 'acting', 'end', 'movie', 'Most', 'rest', 'movie', 'Osment', 'awe', 'adventuresome', 'uncles', 'acting', 'kept', 'principally', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Caine', 'Duvall', 'other', 'hand', 'act', 'appear', 'curmudgeonly', 'eccentric', 'are', 'honorable', 'ethical', 'own', 'strange', 'way.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'family', 'movie', 'blood', 'minimal', 'violence', 'few', 'special', 'effects', 'yet', 'enough', 'humor', 'keep', 'most', 'jaded', 'movie', 'viewer', 'smiling']",Secondhand Lions

789697,A3SYT3JC9VH5UZ,B0000YTP02,Marina Michaels,"[1, 1]","I've watched this movie several times and still love it. The basic story is of a boy, Walter (played by Haley Joel Osment) who is dumped on his great-uncles Garth and Hub (Michael Caine and Robert Duvall) because his skanky, irresponsible mother, Mae (Kyra Sedgwick), is tired of being tied down by him. Garth and Hub aren't interested in Walter, and Walter seems, at first, to be a bit too beaten down by having an unloving mother to really care much.But gradually Walter and his great-uncles start to get to know each other and to warm to each other. One of the things that helps is that the great-uncles seem to have led some very interesting and adventurous lives. They tell stories of things they did when they were younger (as each story is being told, the movie makes the transition from narration to showing the story unfold in live action). These stories are exciting and wonderful and all have core values about life very neatly underlying them.One of the stories is that the great-uncles accumulated a vast amount of gold, though we don't know for sure whether it was acquired the way the great-uncles tell, or through a bank robbery. And it turns out that Mae, in addition to just getting rid of Walter for a while, was also hoping that Walter would find out where the money is hidden, and so she was coldly using him for that purpose.When Walter finds out that it is possible that none of the stories are true, Hub tells him that it doesn't matter, giving a wonderful speech about love, honor, and goodness, and about how there are things worth believing in. (A brief excerpt: ""...That people are basically good; that honor, courage, and virtue mean everything; that ... money and power mean nothing; that good always triumphs over evil...."" Wonderful stuff. I suppose the more cynical and heart-hardened might call this syrupy or even unbelievable, but I call it core values.)I don't want to give anything more away about the story, but I assure you it is a wonderful, warm, human story, womderfully told with great acting on the part of all three major characters (Caine, Duvall, and Osment).

""Secondhand Lions"" comes across as a tad mushy, always searching for a tear-jerking moment, but it never goes over the edge.  Haley Joel Osmont plays a pre-teen dumped by his flighty Mother at the Texan ranch of her two eccentric uncles (Michael Caine and Robert Duvall).  Caine and Duvall excel in humorous odd behavior and compliment each other's characters (Caine is the sensitive one and Duvall is the macho brother).  Haley Joel Osment overacts a bit as the nave castaway, but his heart is intact.  Besides hunting fish with shotguns, violently chasing away traveling salesmen and buying an old lion just to shoot it when it arrives, the two uncles start to grow fond of their `nephew'.  What follows is a summer of tall tales, oddball relatives, a gang of teenage bullies and a large cache of money that is rumored to exist on the property.  The stories Caine tells Osment about their past are lively, humorous and vividly reproduced in scenes edited throughout the film.  It seems the two brothers were shanghaied to Morocco during World War II.  The biggest secret regards the cache of money that all the greedy relatives want to get their hands on.The direction and sound is superb and the acting is believable if you can get past Caine's inability to sound like a Texan.  Director Tim McCanlies directorial debut keeps the story going and the end result is a nice surprise.  It seems life can be fair after all.  This makes for a good family film, especially for younger boys, but it's nice to have a movie that exudes a wholesome atmosphere akin to a Mark Twain story.  It may be another `coming of age' story, but the cast and director make sure you are never bored.Lots of extras are here, including the Director's commentary (there's some interested anecdotes), an `On The Set' mini-documentary and another documentary on actor Haley Joel Osment, which is fairly amazing considering his age.",4,Just Like Mark Twain,1085443200,"05 25, 2004",2004,1964,"['Sometimes', 'have', 'give', 'film', 'credit', 'just', 'trying', 'Secondhand', 'Lions', 'across', 'tad', 'mushy', 'always', 'searching', 'tear-jerking', 'moment', 'never', 'edge', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osmont', 'pre-teen', 'dumped', 'flighty', 'Mother', 'Texan', 'ranch', 'two', 'eccentric', 'uncles', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Caine', 'Duvall', 'excel', 'humorous', 'odd', 'behavior', 'compliment', 'other', 'characters', 'Caine', 'sensitive', 'one', 'Duvall', 'macho', 'brother', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'bit', 'nave', 'castaway', 'heart', 'intact', 'hunting', 'fish', 'shotguns', 'violently', 'chasing', 'away', 'traveling', 'salesmen', 'buying', 'old', 'lion', 'just', 'shoot', 'when', 'two', 'uncles', 'start', 'grow', 'fond', 'nephew', 'What', 'summer', 'tall', 'tales', 'oddball', 'relatives', 'gang', 'teenage', 'bullies', 'large', 'cache', 'money', 'rumored', 'exist', 'property', 'stories', 'Caine', 'Osment', 'past', 'are', 'lively', 'humorous', 'vividly', 'reproduced', 'scenes', 'edited', 'film', 'two', 'brothers', 'were', 'shanghaied', 'Morocco', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'biggest', 'secret', 'regards', 'cache', 'money', 'greedy', 'want', 'get', 'hands', 'on.The', 'direction', 'sound', 'superb', 'acting', 'believable', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'Caine', 'inability', 'sound', 'Texan', 'Director', 'Tim', 'McCanlies', 'directorial', 'debut', 'story', 'going', 'end', 'result', 'nice', 'surprise', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'fair', 'good', 'family', 'film', 'especially', 'younger', 'boys', 'nice', 'have', 'movie', 'wholesome', 'atmosphere', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'cast', 'director', 'make', 'sure', 'are', 'never', 'bored.Lots', 'extras', 'are', 'here', 'including', 'Director', 'commentary', 'interested', 'anecdotes', 'Set', 'mini-documentary', 'documentary', 'actor', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'fairly', 'amazing', 'considering', 'age']",Secondhand Lions

The plot moves along at a very good pace. Indeed, I was never bored even though the adventure scenes and the ""message"" of the film with those old fashioned values are not exactly new ones. Look also for impressive cinematography and choreography both of which serve to add a great deal of color to this motion picture. In addition, the script was well written.When the film begins, we meet Walter (Haley Joel Osment) who is essentially being dumped for the summer by his irresponsible mother Mae (Kyra Sedgwick) at the dilapidated old home where two of Mae's uncles live. Mae's uncles Hub (Robert Duvall) and Garth (Michael Caine) have quite a reputation: Rumor has it that they have stashed away a huge fortune and the other rumors of just how they got that money range from winning a lawsuit after being in a psychiatric hospital for forty years to their having led practically inexplicable, dangerous lives all over Europe and North Africa decades ago. In addition, Mae wants Walter to ingratiate himself to the older men so that she can get her hands on their money really, really fast--after her summer fling with yet another abusive boyfriend is over, that is.It isn't easy for the shy boy Walter to adapt to the two uncles and their creaky, inhospitable old home. Walter tries to run away and contact his mother where she told him she'd be; but as usual Mae lied to him and now Walter is stuck spending the summer with Hub and Garth. However, it also isn't too long before Walter slowly forms a bond with the two cantankerous older men; and Walter learns more and more of their incredible past experiences as told to him mostly by Garth. It's fascinating to see their flashback through Walter's imagination while he listens to their stories.But are these incredible stories of fighting sheiks with swords in North Africa and involvement in endless battles in the French Foreign Legion actually true? Walter understandably has his doubts and it isn't until the very end of the picture that the truth is definitively uncovered. Moreover, what about other greedy relatives including Helen (Deirdre O'Connell) who want the rumored stash of money for themselves? They are determined to get their hands on that rumored to be true hidden huge stash of money!In addition, look for good performances by Christian Kane as a young Hub; Kevin Haberer as a young Garth; Emmanuelle Vaugier as Princess Jasmine; Adam Ozturk as a Sheik who Garth says had quite a fight with a young Hub over Jasmine and Jace Pitre as the young teenager Frankie.I liked the bonus on the first disc that has a running commentary with director Tim McCanlies. There is also a second DVD with nothing but wonderful bonus features on it.Secondhand Lions is a good film despite the ever-so slightly-sappy flavor it can have at certain moments. There are many action and adventure scenes that held my attention every step of the way. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it and people who enjoy dramas and even coming of age stories will not be disappointed.",5,"a story as old as the hills, but you'll end up recommending it",1275696000,"06 5, 2010",2010,3167,"['Secondhand', 'Lions', 'excellent', 'film', 'acting', 'nothing', 'short', 'first', 'rate', 'casting', 'was', 'very', 'thoughtfully', 'done', 'plot', 'along', 'very', 'good', 'pace', 'Indeed', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'even', 'adventure', 'scenes', 'message', 'film', 'old', 'fashioned', 'values', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'new', 'ones', 'Look', 'also', 'impressive', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'serve', 'add', 'great', 'deal', 'color', 'motion', 'picture', 'addition', 'script', 'was', 'well', 'film', 'meet', 'Walter', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'who', 'essentially', 'being', 'dumped', 'summer', 'irresponsible', 'mother', 'Mae', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'dilapidated', 'old', 'home', 'where', 'two', 'Mae', 'uncles', 'live', 'Mae', 'uncles', 'Hub', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Garth', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'have', 'reputation', 'Rumor', 'have', 'stashed', 'away', 'huge', 'fortune', 'other', 'rumors', 'just', 'how', 'got', 'money', 'range', 'winning', 'lawsuit', 'being', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'forty', 'years', 'having', 'led', 'practically', 'inexplicable', 'dangerous', 'lives', 'Europe', 'North', 'Africa', 'decades', 'ago', 'addition', 'Mae', 'Walter', 'ingratiate', 'older', 'men', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'money', 'really', 'really', 'fast', 'summer', 'fling', 'yet', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'is.It', ""n't"", 'easy', 'shy', 'boy', 'Walter', 'adapt', 'two', 'uncles', 'creaky', 'inhospitable', 'old', 'home', 'Walter', 'run', 'away', 'contact', 'mother', 'where', 'told', ""'d"", 'be', 'usual', 'Mae', 'lied', 'now', 'Walter', 'stuck', 'spending', 'summer', 'Hub', 'Garth', 'However', 'also', ""n't"", 'too', 'long', 'before', 'Walter', 'slowly', 'bond', 'two', 'cantankerous', 'older', 'men', 'Walter', 'more', 'more', 'incredible', 'past', 'experiences', 'told', 'mostly', 'Garth', 'fascinating', 'see', 'flashback', 'Walter', 'imagination', 'stories.But', 'are', 'incredible', 'stories', 'fighting', 'sheiks', 'swords', 'North', 'Africa', 'involvement', 'endless', 'battles', 'French', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'actually', 'true', 'Walter', 'understandably', 'doubts', ""n't"", 'very', 'end', 'picture', 'truth', 'definitively', 'uncovered', 'Moreover', 'what', 'other', 'greedy', 'relatives', 'including', 'Helen', 'Deirdre', ""O'Connell"", 'who', 'want', 'rumored', 'stash', 'money', 'are', 'determined', 'get', 'hands', 'rumored', 'be', 'true', 'hidden', 'huge', 'stash', 'money', 'addition', 'look', 'good', 'performances', 'Christian', 'Kane', 'young', 'Hub', 'Kevin', 'Haberer', 'young', 'Garth', 'Emmanuelle', 'Vaugier', 'Princess', 'Jasmine', 'Adam', 'Ozturk', 'Sheik', 'who', 'Garth', 'had', 'quite', 'fight', 'young', 'Hub', 'Jasmine', 'Jace', 'Pitre', 'young', 'teenager', 'Frankie.I', 'liked', 'bonus', 'first', 'disc', 'running', 'commentary', 'director', 'Tim', 'McCanlies', 'also', 'second', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'wonderful', 'bonus', 'features', 'it.Secondhand', 'Lions', 'good', 'film', 'ever-so', 'slightly-sappy', 'flavor', 'can', 'have', 'certain', 'moments', 'are', 'many', 'action', 'adventure', 'scenes', 'held', 'attention', 'step', 'way', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'actors', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'dramas', 'even', 'coming', 'age', 'stories', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",Secondhand Lions

After I watched it, however, I realized what an injustice the preview had done to the movie itself.I loved the country setting and cinematography as well as the fact that most of the story unfolds in the 50s (maybe 60s?). Well-known stars and good acting help make this touching story a screen hit.Without giving away vital details, a couple of old rogue-ish great uncles wind up caring for their great nephew that they've only recently come to know.  Not only are the men bachelors, they're mildly grumpy, and stuck in their ways.  Needless to say, taking care of a young boy isn't in their repetoire of experience or necessarily something they have much interest in doing.  Recounting their past grand adventures keeps the boy entertained and intrigued.  Listening to these stories, which are portrayed retrospectively throughout the movie, draws him closer to his uncles and they form a remarkable bond.  I found myself chuckling many times throughout the movie because of some of the uncles' antics.  Likewise, I felt heavy-hearted in some scenes because of the emotional burden the boy has to carry.The movie won't appeal to everyone (my husband fell asleep while watching it), but I still highly recommend it.

789712,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0000YTP02,Michael Butts,"[2, 3]","It's hard not to like a film that is so wonderfully cast, and one that manipulates to all the right points.  Robert Duvall and Michael Caine shine in the way they underplay their roles of the eccentric, yet wise, great uncles to Haley Joel Osment's Walter.  Osment, a perpetual child at heart, once again demonstrates the talent he was given, and doesn't play on his &quot;cuteness,&quot; but acts the role as he should.  There are some wonderfully funny and touchingly poignant moments in the film.  The stories told by Caine about his brother's swashbuckling days is all Indiana Jones and one wonders if they are true?  Or are these affable old gentlemen truly bank robbers?  If you watch the deleted scenes, you can see where the evidence is strong that they did rob banks.  Director Mccaslin obviously wanted us to believe what might not be true, in expiating these scenes from the final cut.

Add to that the fact that the uncle's (played by Michael Caine and Robert Duvall) preferred method of fishing relies on the use of shotguns.  The same shotguns provide a not so friendly reception for any traveling salesmen that might drive past the numerous signs of warning along the dirt road leading to their farmhouse.Caine and Duvall are two brothers that have returned to Texas from a 40 year absence of mystery and adventure, reputedly with a vast fortune obtained through (take your pick) chicanery, theft, deception or worse.  Eccentrics with a capital ""E"", all we know about them for sure is that they have an indeterminate amount of money, an independent nature and little use for the rest of the modern world.  Some people might criticize Caine's attempt at a Texas twang, however what would you expect from a native Texan that's spent the previous 40 years in Morocco, Kenya and other parts unknown?Haley Joel Osment plays ""the kid"" who is torn between issues of abandonment,  confusion (who are these bizarre old men really?), curiosity (where is their money and how much is there?), and pure wonder (can their stories be true in any way?).  Kyra Sedgwick is his mother, who quickly telescopes her real priorities by beginning every letter or converstation with ""how are you doing, have you found the money yet?""Secondhand Lions (yes, there is some substance behind the title), didn't seem to get the attention that it deserved during it's theatrical release, and I hope that it finds a larger following in the more forgiving market of DVD and video.

This is a nearly perfect movie.As a fan of small scale character driven stories; this is that kind of movie. There is much more. It has heart, it has mystery, it has action, and it has humor. Playing to my sensitivities; it is never over the top maudlin, and it treats you as an intelligent person.Short plot summation:Bachelor brothers Hub (Robert Duval) and Garth (Michael Caine) live secluded retired lives in some remote part of Texas. It is the early 1960's. Their main form of entertainment is to send traveling salesmen scampering away dodging shotgun fire. One day one of their nieces Mae (Kyra Sedgwick) dumps her son Walter (Hayley Osment) on the two men as she follows whatever new dead-end scheme she thinks will bring her life under control.All the two men have to offer is the kind of stability the boy has never experienced and a chance for the boy to be exposed to a seriously male universal view. Walter, and through him, the rest of us learn these two old men have a story to tell. Walter seems to understand that the elaborate story is something they made up and expects it to follow the classical path of all such stories.Along the way there is a real Africa Lioness - if somewhat old and used, some money grubbing relatives and an even slower reveal that the brothers may have a real story to tell. So where did all that money come from? Who was the real Jasmine (Emmanuelle Vaugler)? And just how did that one salesman get through?Underneath this is a movie about story telling. It is a movie about seeing past surfaces and about ""The speech every man should hear"".  What is most important is that none of this deeper stuff matters. It is entertaining and uplifting. Again playing to my preferences, the up lift does not hammer you down. It flows naturally out of the story line.Duval and Caine play off each other as naturally as if they had been boys together. If you are a fan of acting, this by-play more than covers the few dollars for this disk. Some reviews have taken issue with Haley Osment. I liked his performance. His movie age has to be prepubescent, but also old enough to have some mature insight. Given that Walter has had to be the adult around his mother, the fact that the brothers give him the chance to be a child has to come through. This is a complex assignment. Haley handles it.This review may already be too long. Over analysis can mean that there are complex things to understand before you can enjoy. Enjoy Second hand Lions, stuff the analysis.

I guess it's the top-rated actors in this movie that convinced me that it's worth my while.  Every time those actors acted in movies, their career is on the line.  Any bad or fair reviews upon their performances would have dented their reputation somewhat.  Look at Kevin Costner, from his heyday of ""Dances with Wolves"", he gradually sank into oblivion by involving himself in a few duds such as ""Waterworld"", ""Postman"".  Naturally, ""Secondhand Lions"" was about a matured-beyond-his-age nephew in the form of Joel Osmont who went to stay with his long lost uncles in the forms of Michael Caine & Robert Duvall.  At first, both parties were skeptical about one another.  The nephew was scared & at the same time bewildered by the uncles who shot at salespeople as a hobby, concocting their own version of fishing by blowing the fish off the water.  The uncles themselves were a mystery.  There was this rumour that they stacked away hordes of money & they lived a lifestyle that were considered an acquired taste for some.  As both parties started to warm to one another, they started to open up their hearts to one another.  The nephew was as keen as a mustard to learn about their past filled with adventures in exotic land.  Whether the uncles told the truth or not would only be revealed towards the end.  Anyhow, the adventures were told in a ""once upon a time"" fashion & it was moment like that we knew we were indulged with a family story.  The essence of the story is that to hell with life...live it, as long as you have your boots on.  Truth to be told, it's a very heart-warming movie with those tender moment & not forgetting those hillarious moment of a literal lion that roamed the corn field, a pig that thought it was a dog.  I feel what made this family movie a cut above the rest is the effortless performance of those actors mentioned.  Kyra Sedgewick is convincing as Joel's character's mum for ending up with loser boyfriend all the time, and the male teacher (with his inner demon problem)in TV series, ""Boston High"" is Kyra's character's boyfriend in this instance.

789749,A2PPJN8OKSXMPT,B0000YTP02,Pippin O' Rohan,"[4, 4]","'It was my cousin Rick, a gifted musician who plays at Bill's, who suggested that we watch ""Secondhand Lions"" last summer when you asked about this movie yesterday.  It stars Robert Duvall and Michael Caine, and takes place in Texas in the summer of 1962.  They play the part of two bachelor brothers who have retired on their broken-down ranch when their 14 year-old great nephew (Haley Joel Osment of ""The Sixth Sense"") comes to stay for the summer. If ever you were shipped off to unknown relatives at that vulnerable age, you may relate to this in some way.  Call it a hit-or-miss proposition if you will..'Moving along, one might say that ""Secondhand Lions"" has a pride of four:  the two lions in the elderly Hub and his brother Garth, both now retired from active duty and shooting the breeze; one lion cub in the form of their nephew, Walter, and last but not least, the old and mangy Jasmine, the lioness in this story.When Walter gets dropped off by his lost and desperate mother, Mae (Kyra Sedgewick), to spend the summer with his great-uncles, they are not too excited about this, nor is Walter.  In addition, he has been given instructions by his frantic mom to get into the good graces of these strangers with a view to becoming their inheritor.  Walter has no interest, or intention of doing this.  In the meantime, the rest of his distant scattered family are aware that these elderly bachelors have a fortune stashed away somewhere on their property.  It's not long before these 'vultures' start showing up for a friendly family visit.  Walter, in turn, decides to leave and manages to locate a phone booth to contact his mother, only to find out that once again she lied to him, and he doesn't know where she is.Disheartened, he returns on the dusty road to his uncles' place and prepares himself for a long tedious summer. While trying to adapt and get used to the wild antics of these elderly men (at times it is Walter who proves to be the more mature of the three), he finds himself surrounded in their rambling shack by their pet pig and numerous dogs, and doesn't quite know what to do with himself.  No peers, no television, nothing really to do at all, except to wait it out and hoof it for the duration of his stay.Reliving their youth and past adventures, the two men come up with the crazy idea of getting a lion for sport, only to find out with disgust that they've been sold a toothless and tame lioness from a circus.  Walter is enchanted by her, and calls her Jasmine after finding in his attic room a photo of a beautiful woman, the love of Hub's life with the same name. Hub feels slightly pained by a revival of these memories, but he's not going to allow this new Jasmine to starve, and while trying to handle heavy pounds of dry chow, he ends up in the hospital for a short stay.  When Garth and Walter bring him home, they stop at a local grimy eating hole and a gang of bored young punks decide to make trouble, switch-blades and all.  Garth slowly stands up and reveals his rifle.  His brother waves him aside, and here unravels quite a show-down between Hub and these thugs.  Walter watches anxiously the lesson his uncle chooses to give them while carefully taking in his message.When they get home, Jasmine has accidentally been released from her crate by the relatives who left, and delighted by her freedom at last, the old lioness has wandered off and made a restful jungle patch for herself in their cornfield.  And then, the heart of the movie begins:It is Garth first who tells Walter about his earlier life with his brother when they were young men.  A fascinating story of courage and adversity, laced with pragmatism and depicted for the viewers, he emphasizes the bond between siblings and when Walter wishes to hear more, Garth replies that he will have to ask Hub for his story and in his own way.  Hub's version is a bit of a wonderful fairy tale, somewhat reminiscent of an enchanted Arabian Night and a profound love story (the viewers also watch this unraveling on the screen in the telling).But perhaps the highlight of the movie is when Walter who has been lied to so often, calls Hub on whether this is just another bunch of tall tales.  Hub becomes somewhat stern and gives his young nephew a brief speech about 'The Truth and What Every Boy Needs to Know'.  And, when Walter's mother returns with a slimy and dangerous boyfriend to pick up her 'property', or young son, more action begins until it reaches a satisfying conclusion.A coming-of-age story, the first important choice that one has to make in life, the courage of 'Lions' where even Jasmine the lioness goes on to prove herself in a final splash of glory? All of the above perhaps for some of the viewers while implausible for others.

The story keeps one guessing until the end, are these two eccentric uncles just crazy, or did they live exciting lives as younger men?  There is a lesson for us here. In a youth oriented culture, we tend to be very dismissive of old people.  We see them as past their prime whose day is over and who have little to contribute except to leave us a bunch of money. This movie was a reminder that old people were once young; they were driven by the same passions we are, they had the adventures that may even surpasses our mundane existence.So gather the kids around the tube and slip Secondhand Lions into your DVD player.

He is very introverted and his uncles seem to have no patience for other people, including their own family. This makes for an awkward union, with the easily scared kid not knowing how to behave or what to expect from his two seemingly out-of-it relatives.Secondhand lions is a heart warming film from beginning to end. Even if it gets a little corny in some moments, to see how the two old men open up to this kid who comes out of the shell in front of their eyes is truly beautiful.However, this film is not only a coming of age story. To keep the story going without dragging its feet in sugary moments between the characters, we are shown the story of how the uncles lived their younger years and how they supposedly amased a fortune. These are very tall tales - the Foreign Legion, world wars, sheiks, damsels in distress, bank robberies and a whole lot more. Are these tales true? Did the uncles really do all this or is it just their imagination? Does it matter if it's true when you really believe in something?The film is also full of funny moments, coming mostly from the habits of the two old men and from the kid's reactions to them and to their eccentric lifestyle.Having said all that, the thing that takes this movie to the next level is the performances given by the three leads. Oscar winners Robert Duvall and Michael Caine play the uncles to Oscar nominee Haley Joel Osment's Walter, and none of them miss a beat throughout the whole film. Duvall is excellent as the tough as nails, not-to-be-messed-with uncle Hub, just as Caine does a fantastic job with the warmer uncle Garth. But I feal that the movie belongs mostly to Osment, who again proofs he's the best child actor to come around in a while. Now in his teenage years, he has made a successful transition to more adult characters (even if 'more adult' means having 15 years!).All in all, a great movie.",4,4.5 stars,1082419200,"04 20, 2004",2004,2019,"['Little', 'Walter', 'Osment', 'irresponsible', 'mother', 'Sedgwick', 'who', 'one', 'summer', 'leave', 'two', 'eccentric', 'uncles', 'very', 'introverted', 'uncles', 'seem', 'have', 'patience', 'other', 'people', 'including', 'own', 'family', 'awkward', 'union', 'easily', 'scared', 'kid', 'not', 'knowing', 'how', 'behave', 'what', 'expect', 'two', 'seemingly', 'out-of-it', 'relatives.Secondhand', 'lions', 'heart', 'warming', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'Even', 'little', 'corny', 'moments', 'see', 'how', 'two', 'old', 'men', 'open', 'up', 'kid', 'who', 'shell', 'front', 'eyes', 'truly', 'beautiful.However', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'keep', 'story', 'going', 'dragging', 'feet', 'sugary', 'moments', 'characters', 'are', 'shown', 'story', 'how', 'uncles', 'lived', 'younger', 'years', 'how', 'supposedly', 'amased', 'fortune', 'are', 'very', 'tall', 'tales', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'world', 'wars', 'sheiks', 'damsels', 'distress', 'bank', 'robberies', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'Are', 'tales', 'true', 'Did', 'uncles', 'really', 'do', 'just', 'imagination', 'matter', 'true', 'when', 'really', 'believe', 'something', 'film', 'also', 'full', 'funny', 'moments', 'coming', 'mostly', 'habits', 'two', 'old', 'men', 'kid', 'reactions', 'eccentric', 'lifestyle.Having', 'said', 'thing', 'movie', 'next', 'level', 'performances', 'given', 'three', 'leads', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'play', 'uncles', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'Walter', 'none', 'miss', 'beat', 'whole', 'film', 'Duvall', 'excellent', 'tough', 'nails', 'not-to-be-messed-with', 'uncle', 'Hub', 'just', 'Caine', 'fantastic', 'job', 'warmer', 'uncle', 'Garth', 'feal', 'movie', 'mostly', 'Osment', 'who', 'again', 'proofs', 'best', 'child', 'actor', 'come', 'around', 'while', 'Now', 'teenage', 'years', 'made', 'successful', 'transition', 'more', 'adult', 'characters', 'even', ""'more"", 'adult', 'means', 'having', '15', 'years', '.All', 'great', 'movie']",Secondhand Lions

They live in a shack and entertain themselves by shooting at traveling salesmen, assembling and flying old biplanes, and other unusual pasttimes.When Walter sees Hub sleepwalking and reliving sword fights (with a toilet plunger), he asks Garth about it.

789806,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,B0000YTP02,Stephen A. Haines,"[0, 6]","A film starring Michael Caine and Robert Duvall should be an assured winner.  Two old coots in some form of retirement in an isolated setting - what better scenario could you seek?  Has it been done before with ""Grumpy Old Men"" or ""The Sunshine Boys""?  Not quite.  For one thing, these two are brothers.  While there is tension, it isn't the dominant theme.  Caine, who  has the incredibly difficult task of becoming a Texican, carries it off admirably.  Duvall, who isn't a Texan either, can convey personalities that overcome narrow origin identities.  Finally, of course, we are left with Osment, who imparts no origins.  In fact, he doesn't seem to have any, nor does he seem very interested in finding any.  He's not even there as a mediator for the two men.  Could this story have been told without him?The two elderly gentlemen are ensconced in a ramshackle mansion plopped on some location in Texas where there's water.  Fishing with shotguns and making bizarre purchases with an undisclosed source of income, their settled life is rudely interrupted by Walter [Osment] being dumped on their verandah.  The castaway child theme is pretty shopworn, and Osment struggles valiantly to shed the bonds of clich&eacute;.  In their portrayals, the two great-uncles offer all possible support for this effort - with Duvall providing a sense of mystique and Caine giving a sort of detached caring function.  Caine is given the task of relating the pair's romantic history to Walter's rapt attention.  It's not Cinderella in reversed gender, yet the pair seem only mildly interested in raising Walter.  The inevitable ""running away"" scene sets this aspect firmly.As the story unfolds, Walter provides a focus for the grand-uncles.  They don't ""raise"" him, of course.  He's pretty much too old for that already.  But he becomes increasingly aware that these two aren't simply a brace of bizarre old coots.  His respect for them grows as they demonstrate their respective strengths.  Little is demanded of Walter by the brothers, but he merges into their live with increasing readiness.  This progress is attended by some wonderfully hilarious scenes.  McCanlies' imaging talents come to the fore in his use of a pack of dogs of indeterminate breeds.  They are attentive to all events, and one senses they are a set of canine ""Walters"" who clearly entered the homestead seeking refuge and elected for permanence.  But the lion . . . ?Although this trio all struggle to overcome a tired plot - even the novel ending doesn't redeem it - the effort is misguided.  Someone should have contracted to bring these three together, then write an appropriate story for their skills.  Instead, they were given the wrong writer in the wrong context doing the wrong job.  Whoever initiated the ""writer-director"" duality should be sizzling in the furthest reaches of Sheol.  The two job descriptions simply cannot be properly merged.  This is a film by a Texican, of Texicans and for Texicans.  McCanLies' commentary, riddled with ""ums"", ""unhhs"" and ""ers"" should have been replaced by commentary by the working trio.  It's worth a single viewing - just to see Caine and Duvall working together.  Now that they've worked together once, perhaps somebody can do the job properly next time.

A young boy stays for the summer with his two (supposedly) rich relatives and they tell him stories.Fortunately, this movie is NOT what it seems. For starters, I think Haley Joel Osment is preparing himself to be the next Jude Law. Far from a one-hit wonder or child-actor who transitions poorly, the kid keeps amazing me with his outstanding performances in films (maybe Michael Caine just wanted to be in the same movie with him). Then we have the always awesome Caine and the always solid Duvall.This should be enough to make for a good movie. But wait! There's more! Not only that, but when these two old-timers start telling stories, the movie totally shifts gears. The flash-back sequences take on a life of their own. Harkening back to the old-school adventure films of the 20's and 30's, these sequences feature great action, adventure, vivid visuals, great cinematography, and a healthy dose of humor.This film features compelling characters (and great performances by all), tells a heartfelt entertaining story, is wonderfully filmed, and features some wildly entertaining comic scenes (when Caine and Duvall want to shoot a salesman and the kid tells them to wait and see what he's selling, one of them replies that they'll let him go ahead and show them...and THEN they'll shoot him).

It was much better than Big Fish, which came highly recommended to me by one of my co-workers. Michael Caine, Robert Duvall, Haley Joel Osment (looking scared to death), and Kyra Sedgwick are all fantastic.  Even Josh Lucas' extended cameo as the adult Walter is a sublime performance.  After watching the deleted and alternate scenes on the flipside of the DVD, I have come to the conclusion that Mr. McCanlies should go back into the editing room and come out with a ""director's cut"" that splices together the alternate endings.  Since this has been out a while, I don't feel bad about giving away spoilers.  The theatrical ending shows adult Walter meeting the Sheik's grandson at the uncles' farm after they die in a freak airplane accident.  The alternate ending shows the funeral and we get to meet Walter's wife and kids;  the funeral is interrupted by an appearance of the sheik himself.  What would've been cool would have been to combine these two endings, Walter gets to give his eloquent eulogy, and then the sheik's grandson arrives in the helicopter and sends the funeral attendees scattering for cover.  I thought it would have been an interesting take for the grandson's son to meet Walter's 2 boys, and the end the movie with them going off to play after the ceremony and sort of wrapping up the storylines.  This would've probably added close to 15 minutes to a 105 minute movie, and family movies tend to run fairly short (I guess the powers that be feel that kids can only pay attention up to 90 minutes or so).  I don't think this would be the case here as the movie draws you into the story so compellingly that you wouldn't know the time had passed. And if you don't warm to this story, I think you better go to the Wizard and ask for a heart.

However, it is a movie that has a great story line and moving plot.Duvall and Caine are brothers who own a run down house and barn on several acres of land in Texas. Osment is dumped off at these two men's place by his mother, who quickly informs him that these are his great uncles and they have millions stashed away somewhere on their land. Of course, every living relative attempts to get to their money, and these men want nothing but to be left alone. So Osment's showing up merely alienates him from these men he has never even met nor heard of until he gets left at their place.Throughout the course of the film, we find out that these two brothers have been accused of being Mafia hit men who stole all that money from Al Capone in the thirties, or that these two men were actually notorious bank robbers who stole all their money and now have it hidden on their place. However, we also find out, after Caine befriends Osment, that these two men were actually action adventurers who went over to Europe just before the first world war and stayed one step ahead of the Germans, until they were shanghaied into the French Foreign legion.Caine describes to Osment throughout the film all the adventures that he and his brother had in Europe douring the past forty years that they were 'missing.' However, we as the audience do not know the truth about these two men until the very end.The story of the film is very well developed, it flows well, and in many parts is so funny your gut will hurt from laughing. The DVD box indicates that this film is rated PG for language. However, the language is very mild and my wife and I (since we have nieces and nephews) notices only the words 'Damn' and 'Dammit' on about three or four occasions.

789827,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B0000YTP02,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[0, 1]","""Secondhand Lions""  is about shy young Walter (Haley Joel Osment) who is sent to spend the summer with his eccentric uncles (Michael Caine, Robert Duvall) by his Mom (Kyra Sedgwick) so he can secretly discover the millions the old guys are reputed to be sitting on.  At first shocked by his uncles' unconventional behavior, which includes ordering African lions through the mail, the boy soon becomes enthralled with unraveling the mystery that has followed his uncles for years.  Hearing tales of their exotic adventures involving kidnapped princesses, Arabian shieks, and lost treasure not only brings him closer to his uncles but also teaches him what it means to believe in something, whether it's true or not.

789833,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000YTP02,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Strangel titled film &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot; refer to the two veterans Michael Caine and Robert Duvall, who play the grumpy old uncles to the 14-year-old boy Haley Joel Osment.  Though the film is sugary at times, wearing its heart on the sleeve, the two leading actors are so good and wonderful that sooner or later you stop thinking about any bad things about it.  And the animals (including a lion) are also fun to see.The two elderly brothers Hub and Garth are living in an old house, in the middle of nowhere, with four dogs and a pig.  They are said to have lots of money, and some of the relatives and the salesmen too rather insistently try to be nice to them.  Their usual method of turning their kind offer is sarcasm or shotguns.To them, comes Mae (Kyra Sedgwick, most underrated and ill-used) and her son Walter (Osment).  Mae drops him at the door of their house, saying some transparent lies about her new career.  Walter, now alone, has nowhere to go but these grim old guys, who, however, later turn out not so unfriendly to him.  And there seems to have been a romance in their past, concerning the adventure and a girl named Jasmine (Emmanuelle Vaugier).To say &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot; is full of corny moments is pointless; it is about the life taken as such, full of absurd and ridiculous things, but still worth to experience, and the two veteran actors are to teach the young a few thing about life through these absurd and ridiculous events the film shows us.See, for example, the &quot;fight&quot; scenes between Robert Duvall's Hub and four young men wielding switch-blades.  If I write the result of the brawl (which I won't), you will not  believe it, no more than the Southern accent of Sir Micheal Caine.  But that happens, and to those who are ready to accept these tales as they are, that becomes true, and gives hilarious time.My complaint is different -- it's about Osment.  Though born in 1988, he is too old (or mature) to play Walter, who could listen to these men's tales among the sheiks and camels.  And the ending (which is re-written) is unnecessarily long, explaining what the film should not explain.  But anyway, that's my complaint, and you may feel otherwise.Hokum, sure, but &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot; is the kind of a film we always need; need, I mean, to feel good, to watch with family, and most of all to know that we like these sweet tales and extraordinary characters we could see only in film.",4,Stories You Should Believe in: Sugary But Enchanting,1089417600,"07 10, 2004",2004,2458,"['Strangel', 'titled', 'film', 'quot', 'Secondhand', 'Lions', 'quot', 'refer', 'two', 'veterans', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'who', 'play', 'grumpy', 'old', 'uncles', '14-year-old', 'boy', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'film', 'sugary', 'times', 'wearing', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'two', 'leading', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'wonderful', 'sooner', 'later', 'stop', 'thinking', 'bad', 'things', 'animals', 'including', 'lion', 'are', 'also', 'fun', 'see.The', 'two', 'elderly', 'brothers', 'Hub', 'Garth', 'are', 'living', 'old', 'house', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'four', 'dogs', 'pig', 'are', 'said', 'have', 'lots', 'money', 'relatives', 'salesmen', 'too', 'rather', 'insistently', 'try', 'be', 'nice', 'usual', 'method', 'turning', 'kind', 'offer', 'sarcasm', 'shotguns.To', 'Mae', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'most', 'underrated', 'ill-used', 'son', 'Walter', 'Osment', 'Mae', 'door', 'house', 'saying', 'transparent', 'new', 'career', 'Walter', 'now', 'alone', 'nowhere', 'go', 'grim', 'old', 'guys', 'who', 'however', 'later', 'turn', 'out', 'not', 'so', 'unfriendly', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'romance', 'past', 'concerning', 'adventure', 'girl', 'named', 'Jasmine', 'Emmanuelle', 'Vaugier', '.To', 'say', 'quot', 'Secondhand', 'Lions', 'quot', 'full', 'corny', 'moments', 'pointless', 'life', 'taken', 'such', 'full', 'absurd', 'ridiculous', 'things', 'still', 'worth', 'experience', 'two', 'veteran', 'actors', 'are', 'teach', 'young', 'few', 'thing', 'life', 'absurd', 'ridiculous', 'events', 'film', 'us.See', 'example', 'quot', 'fight', 'quot', 'scenes', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Hub', 'four', 'young', 'men', 'wielding', 'switch-blades', 'write', 'result', 'brawl', 'wo', ""n't"", 'will', 'not', 'believe', 'no', 'more', 'Southern', 'accent', 'Sir', 'Micheal', 'Caine', 'who', 'are', 'ready', 'accept', 'tales', 'are', 'true', 'hilarious', 'time.My', 'complaint', 'different', 'Osment', 'Though', 'born', '1988', 'too', 'old', 'mature', 'play', 'Walter', 'who', 'could', 'listen', 'men', 'tales', 'sheiks', 'camels', 'ending', 're-written', 'unnecessarily', 'long', 'explaining', 'what', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'explain', 'anyway', 'complaint', 'may', 'feel', 'otherwise.Hokum', 'sure', 'quot', 'Secondhand', 'Lions', 'quot', 'kind', 'film', 'always', 'need', 'need', 'mean', 'feel', 'good', 'watch', 'family', 'most', 'know', 'like', 'sweet', 'tales', 'extraordinary', 'characters', 'could', 'see', 'only', 'film']",Secondhand Lions
789834,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B0000YTP02,Tucker Andersen,"[306, 315]","As this film opens, a sullen fourteen year old Walter (Haley Joel Osment) is about to be deposited with his two gruff and irascible old uncles against his will by his mother Mae (Kyra Sedgwick) while she supposedly pursues her education and a career. Hub and Garth McCann, played respectively by Robert Duvall and Michael Caine, are no more enamored of the arrangement than is Walter, but an uneasy truce occurs between them as Walter comes to understand their eccentricities and in fact serves as somewhat of an outlet for Garth's desire to settle down somewhat in his final years. One of the elements twhich makes the film a true delight is the extreme nature of the antics of these  ""old men"", whether it is shooting at traveling salesmen for fun or alienating their relatives to maintain their solitude. The backdrop to the story is that Hub and Garth are rumored to be quite wealthy; and in fact Walter's mother instructs him to attempt to locate the source and location of their supposed wealth. (Perhaps the mafia, or bank robberies, or the foreign legion?)As Walter settles in with them and their numerous dogs (and a pig who thinks he's a dog),  the ""plot suddenly thickens"" as Hub acts strangely and Walter discovers mysterious evidence of a beautiful young woman somewhere in their history. Garth tells Walter a fantastic tale of foreign adventure and intrigue involving Hub and the enchanting princess Jasmine, and the story is actually incorporated into the movie in the form of the adventure epics of fifty years ago with Emanuelle Vaugier playing the role of Hub's lost love. Meanwhile, some ""used"" circus animals arrive, including a tired and sick old lion who Walter nurses back to health as he enjoys the ""jungle"" habitat provided by the corn field that has emerged from their failed attempt to grow a vegetable garden. The movie reaches a wonderful climax as the forces of good confront the forces of evil (true comic book style) and Walter is forced to confront the fact that life is full of surprises, not all of which include happy endings, and that we have to be strong enough to accept unpleasant truths and move on.But, of course, any description of the plot doesn't convey the appeal of this film; the storyline is simply the backdrop for the life which is infused into this movie by the superb performances of the stars, the excellent directing, and the way in which the story unfolds. It is fun yet touching, with enough elements of the unexpected interspersed with truly laugh out loud humorous incidents to make the almost two hours fly by. It's hard to know who is more appealing, those old second hand lions Robert Duvall and Michael Caine (who put their superb talents to use in a film they have stated that they really enjoyed making) or Jasmine, the circus lion who late in life was destined for her moment of glory. And the story has a marvelous symmetry, both in the juxtaposition of the opening and closing scenes and in the brief appearance of Josh Lucas as the adult Walter. Finally, the climatic moment is followed by a gradual conclusion to the story which incorporates a truly wonderful finale.In some aspects this is a far from perfect film; in some respects it would be easy to write a critical review detailing the fact that the plot was pure fantasy and that no attempt was made to seriously address many of the issues which the movie raises. But such criticisms would not be consistent with the mood which the movie evoked for me and the remainder of the audience. This movie is about life, about its surprises and its enjoyment, and as corny as it is it is also great fun. I enjoyed it so much that I have chosen to ignore one of my personal reviewing rules; I decided to round up my rating to five stars in spite of the fact that I haven't decided if it is good enough so that I will want to own the DVD. I know that I'll enjoy watching it several more times and decided that was good enough. So, go see this lighthearted film when you want to smile and laugh and feel good about life and it will confirm that whether you're old or a teenager it's still possible to learn and grow and have a good time.Tucker Andersen",5,"(4 1/2)  A Delightful Time with Duvall, Caine and Osment",1065484800,"10 7, 2003",2003,4167,"['film', 'sullen', 'fourteen', 'year', 'old', 'Walter', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'be', 'deposited', 'two', 'gruff', 'irascible', 'old', 'uncles', 'will', 'mother', 'Mae', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'supposedly', 'education', 'career', 'Hub', 'Garth', 'McCann', 'played', 'respectively', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'are', 'more', 'enamored', 'arrangement', 'Walter', 'uneasy', 'truce', 'Walter', 'understand', 'eccentricities', 'fact', 'serves', 'somewhat', 'outlet', 'Garth', 'desire', 'settle', 'down', 'somewhat', 'final', 'years', 'One', 'elements', 'film', 'true', 'delight', 'extreme', 'nature', 'antics', 'old', 'men', 'shooting', 'traveling', 'salesmen', 'fun', 'alienating', 'relatives', 'maintain', 'solitude', 'backdrop', 'story', 'Hub', 'Garth', 'are', 'rumored', 'be', 'quite', 'wealthy', 'fact', 'Walter', 'mother', 'attempt', 'locate', 'source', 'location', 'supposed', 'wealth', 'Perhaps', 'mafia', 'bank', 'robberies', 'foreign', 'legion', 'Walter', 'numerous', 'dogs', 'pig', 'who', 'dog', 'plot', 'suddenly', 'Hub', 'strangely', 'Walter', 'discovers', 'mysterious', 'evidence', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'somewhere', 'history', 'Garth', 'Walter', 'fantastic', 'tale', 'foreign', 'adventure', 'intrigue', 'involving', 'Hub', 'enchanting', 'princess', 'Jasmine', 'story', 'actually', 'incorporated', 'movie', 'form', 'adventure', 'epics', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'Emanuelle', 'Vaugier', 'playing', 'role', 'Hub', 'lost', 'love', 'Meanwhile', 'used', 'circus', 'animals', 'arrive', 'including', 'tired', 'sick', 'old', 'lion', 'who', 'Walter', 'back', 'health', 'jungle', 'habitat', 'provided', 'corn', 'field', 'emerged', 'failed', 'attempt', 'grow', 'vegetable', 'garden', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'climax', 'forces', 'good', 'confront', 'forces', 'evil', 'true', 'comic', 'book', 'style', 'Walter', 'forced', 'confront', 'fact', 'life', 'full', 'surprises', 'not', 'include', 'happy', 'endings', 'have', 'be', 'strong', 'enough', 'accept', 'unpleasant', 'truths', 'move', 'on.But', 'course', 'description', 'plot', ""n't"", 'convey', 'appeal', 'film', 'storyline', 'simply', 'backdrop', 'life', 'infused', 'movie', 'superb', 'performances', 'stars', 'excellent', 'directing', 'way', 'story', 'unfolds', 'fun', 'yet', 'touching', 'enough', 'elements', 'unexpected', 'interspersed', 'truly', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'humorous', 'incidents', 'make', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'fly', 'hard', 'know', 'who', 'more', 'appealing', 'old', 'second', 'hand', 'lions', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'who', 'put', 'superb', 'talents', 'use', 'film', 'have', 'stated', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'making', 'Jasmine', 'circus', 'lion', 'who', 'late', 'life', 'was', 'destined', 'moment', 'glory', 'story', 'marvelous', 'symmetry', 'juxtaposition', 'opening', 'closing', 'scenes', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'adult', 'Walter', 'Finally', 'climatic', 'moment', 'followed', 'gradual', 'conclusion', 'story', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'finale.In', 'aspects', 'far', 'perfect', 'film', 'respects', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'write', 'critical', 'review', 'detailing', 'fact', 'plot', 'was', 'pure', 'fantasy', 'attempt', 'was', 'made', 'seriously', 'address', 'many', 'issues', 'movie', 'such', 'criticisms', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'consistent', 'mood', 'movie', 'evoked', 'remainder', 'audience', 'movie', 'life', 'surprises', 'enjoyment', 'as', 'corny', 'also', 'great', 'fun', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'have', 'chosen', 'ignore', 'one', 'personal', 'reviewing', 'rules', 'decided', 'round', 'up', 'rating', 'five', 'stars', 'spite', 'fact', 'have', ""n't"", 'decided', 'good', 'enough', 'will', 'want', 'own', 'DVD', 'know', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'watching', 'several', 'more', 'times', 'decided', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'So', 'go', 'see', 'lighthearted', 'film', 'when', 'want', 'smile', 'laugh', 'feel', 'good', 'life', 'will', 'confirm', ""'re"", 'old', 'teenager', 'still', 'possible', 'learn', 'grow', 'have', 'good', 'time.Tucker', 'Andersen']",Secondhand Lions

We also get the treat of seeing Kyra Sedgewick doing a brilliantly ditzy, self-centered mother; she surprised and delighted me with her role!Unfortunately, that's where the appeal ended for me. The producers so obviously hoped they could squeeze out one last ""cute little kid"" role for Haley Joel Osment... but his adolescent presence is so blatantly out of place. He's a budding teenager, not a cute little bumpkin, and he over-acts the entire role, trying to be a wide-eyed, adorable child (which of course, is all he ever was known for in the past)... and it falls SO flat.The storyline is rambling and random, trying to be cute, sentimental, tear-jerking, even adventurous.

It's a handsomely produced, technically well-directed, pile of nitwit garbage.I'm not sure why I bought it. The presence of Caine and Duvall was an enticement -- why would they associate themselves with a bad film? I'd forgotten they're the thespic equivalent of Superman -- no matter how poor the film, they'll walk away unscathed. I'd also forgotten that a story can look fine on paper, but be ruined by the time it reaches the screen. And I stupidly chose to ignore the Film Advisory Board ""Award of Excellence"" badge on the box. It's the kiss of death, as it's almost always ""awarded"" to atrocious ""family"" films. (You might want to read the Wikipedia article about this organization. Its claim that it doesn't ""review"" films is hypocritical, at best.)Problems abound, but the principal one is that ""Secondhand Lions"" can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or drama. It starts off as the former, geared toward what a dull seven-year-old would find amusing. Walter's mother is a ludicrous caricature of ""the bad mother"" in children's books, atrociously played by Kyra Sedgewick. Her cousins are even less-believable, with two of the children looking like escapees from a Charles Addams cartoon.Haley Joel Osment gives what could be a career-killing performance, though he can hardly be blamed for an erratic script and (apparent) lack of guidance from the director. (The director penned the script, as well as such unforgettable masterpieces as ""Dennis the Menace Strikes Again!"".)The story is basically a serious one, about a youngster coming to grips with having an incompetent mother and no father, and deciding what he wants to do with his life. The failure to establish and maintain an appropriate approach to this story is fatal. By the time we reach the ""serious"" scene between Duvall and Osment, we simply don't believe it. Worse, Caine's and Duvall's preposterous backstory turns out to be //true//, further diminishing any willingness to believe the rest of the tale. When Osment's mother's new boyfriend starts beating him, the disconnect with the rest of the film shows just how little the director knows about telling a believable story the viewer can relate to (or at least understand). And when you think the story has gotten as stupid as it possibly can, it amazes you with an idiotic attempt at a ""comic"" plane crash.If this review seems incoherent, it's because ""Secondhand Lions"" is so frighteningly bad, in so many ways, that it's difficult to express one's thoughts in a well-organized manner. (It needs a scene-by-scene critique, which neither you nor I have time for.) ""Secondhand Lions"" could have been a charming and affecting -- and humorous (where appropriate) -- story about a boy's coming of age. It is artistic trash, aimed at the lowest emotional and intellectual level of viewers.PS: I just took a look at Roger Ebett's review. Even after his passing, Ebert remains my favorite reviewer, because whether or not you agree with him, he usually has something insightful to say. Not in this case. Ebert was bamboozled into seeing what the director /wanted/ to show, rather than what the film is actually about.
