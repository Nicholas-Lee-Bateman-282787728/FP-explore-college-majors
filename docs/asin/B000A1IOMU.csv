I felt like a reader of a book who finds the last five pages missing.Good acting, good story, well done considering the obviously modest budget but there is simply no getting around the incredibly poor (non)ending. Did they run out of film stock? If shot on video did they screw up and purchase a too short video cartridge when it came time to shoot the movie? Something went wrong that is for sure. The ending pretty much crapped on the rest of the movie. Could have been a true gem but those hopes got dashed with the premature rolling of the credits.Too bad and truly disappointing. Should throw in an expletive or two but it is too hot to get all worked up right now.I cannot recommend renting this movie or even watching the thing for free if and when Amazon offers it for ""free"" for Amazon Prime members.

918566,A3GSGBKCIXB45A,B000A1IOMU,Eddie B.,"[2, 2]","This movie broke a new record for me; it is officially the worst movie I have ever watched in my 24 years on planet Earth. Normally I don't mind budget, middle-grade sci fi movies. Some actually have decent camera work, a decent soundtrack, or even a decent storyline. Let's face it, not every idea for a movie can get a $20 million budget, but with a little creativity and good camera work, a movie can still work out. I mean movies made in the 50's didn't have the CGI at hand today and they still pulled things off. Not Ascension. When I first heard of a movie that took place on Saturn's moon, I thought it sounded really cool, and if the story or characters were compelling enough then I could overlook any cheap CGI this movie possibly would have. That wasn't the case with this movie.The acting is stale, as you can see it in the actors faces that the script and dialog are awful. The set design is atrocious. For being a moon base some fifty years in the future, this place sure doesn't look like it. There is no space-age looking technology anywhere, it's like they didn't even attempt to make it look like so. The whole movie looks like it was filmed in some guys basement with some cardboard cutouts for walls. The actors/actresses aren't even decent looking... I mean at least in other budget movies they throw in a cute actress or something to keep your interested. This movie had none of that.Even the food in this movie is awful. At one point the lead character eats what looks like a combination of vomit, feces, and urine mixed together. Maybe the writers were trying to tell us something... like that this movie is basically on the same level of vomit, feces, and urine mixed together. This is in year 2050 or something, why are they eating ****? Don't you think they would have resourceful ways to create food when on an interplanetary mission? Maybe I'm picking at one thing here, but this is one of many minor problems with this movie, why it doesn't work, and why it doesn't make sense.This movie is a joke. I can't wrap my head around why it was even made. Everything about it is just awful. 1/5, I would give this movie a lower score if I could. There is nothing redeeming about it at all. This is honestly the worst movie I have ever watched, and I am petty forgiving even if a movie is budget or not. Do yourself a favor and watch a movie that's actually decent. There are plenty of other gems out there even in the budget department. This movie is not worth the trouble. It is a pile of crap from beginning to end.",1,"I want my $1.99 back, quiet possibly the worst movie ever made",1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,2541,"['movie', 'broke', 'new', 'record', 'officially', 'worst', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', '24', 'years', 'planet', 'Earth', 'Normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'budget', 'middle-grade', 'sci', 'fi', 'movies', 'actually', 'have', 'decent', 'camera', 'work', 'decent', 'soundtrack', 'even', 'decent', 'storyline', 'Let', 'face', 'not', 'idea', 'movie', 'can', 'get', '20', 'million', 'budget', 'little', 'creativity', 'good', 'camera', 'work', 'movie', 'can', 'still', 'work', 'out', 'mean', 'movies', 'made', '50', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'CGI', 'hand', 'today', 'still', 'pulled', 'things', 'off', 'Not', 'Ascension', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'took', 'place', 'Saturn', 'moon', 'thought', 'sounded', 'really', 'cool', 'story', 'characters', 'were', 'compelling', 'enough', 'then', 'could', 'overlook', 'cheap', 'CGI', 'movie', 'possibly', 'would', 'have', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'stale', 'can', 'see', 'actors', 'script', 'dialog', 'are', 'awful', 'set', 'design', 'atrocious', 'being', 'moon', 'base', 'fifty', 'years', 'future', 'place', 'sure', ""n't"", 'look', 'space-age', 'looking', 'technology', 'anywhere', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'attempt', 'make', 'look', 'so', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'guys', 'basement', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'walls', 'actors/actresses', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'decent', 'looking', 'mean', 'least', 'other', 'budget', 'movies', 'throw', 'cute', 'actress', 'something', 'keep', 'interested', 'movie', 'had', 'none', 'that.Even', 'food', 'movie', 'awful', 'one', 'point', 'lead', 'character', 'what', 'combination', 'vomit', 'feces', 'urine', 'mixed', 'together', 'Maybe', 'writers', 'were', 'trying', 'tell', 'something', 'movie', 'basically', 'same', 'level', 'vomit', 'feces', 'urine', 'mixed', 'together', 'year', '2050', 'something', 'why', 'are', 'eating', '****', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'resourceful', 'ways', 'create', 'food', 'when', 'interplanetary', 'mission', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'picking', 'one', 'thing', 'here', 'one', 'many', 'minor', 'problems', 'movie', 'why', ""n't"", 'work', 'why', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense.This', 'movie', 'joke', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wrap', 'head', 'why', 'was', 'even', 'made', 'Everything', 'just', 'awful', '1/5', 'would', 'give', 'movie', 'lower', 'score', 'could', 'nothing', 'redeeming', 'honestly', 'worst', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'am', 'petty', 'forgiving', 'even', 'movie', 'budget', 'not', 'Do', 'favor', 'watch', 'movie', 'actually', 'decent', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'gems', 'there', 'even', 'budget', 'department', 'movie', 'not', 'worth', 'trouble', 'pile', 'crap', 'beginning', 'end']",Ascension
