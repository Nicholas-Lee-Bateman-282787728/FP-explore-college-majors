687968,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00005V9HB,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","In the hour-long Doors documentary NO ONE HERE GETS OUT ALIVE (1981), it's nice to see Densmore, Krieger and Manzarek still young. Ray chose to film his comment segments on a beach. Apropos, for he and Jim Morrison, ex-students who attended the same film class, hooked up after meeting on a Southern California beach and the self-conscious poet sang to Manzarek the lyrics of ""Moonlight Drive.""This moment is immortalized in Oliver Stone's 1991 biopicTHE DOORS, a film that often sensatioinalizes the group's history. One example is the infamous Ed Sullivan Show live performance. Stone's version has Morrison boldly lunging toward the camera and emphasizing the word ""higher"" in the song ""Light My Fire."" As we see here, that never happened. Twice Jim slipped in the word that the Sullivan gang didn't want, as he stood in partial left profile with eyes closed.So was or wasn't Jim Morrison an ""in your face"" confrontational sort? That night in New Haven (my home town) when he got maced by a cop backstage, Jim definitely was. Telling the Arena crowd what happened to him was cause for an arrest on grounds of inciting a riot. Morrison afterward tangentially immortalized the bust in ""Peace Frog"" (""Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven..."").The other incident of his public defiance wrecked the group's first national tour. In Miami, as Ray Manzarek describes it, Jim mocked his thrill-seeking fans, warned he was going to show ""it"" to them. Ray says the singer removed his shirt to cover his groin area, then playfully pulled the shirt away for brief flashes. ""Did you see it? Did you see it?"" he taunted. Manzarek insists his bandmate never exposed little Jim to the crowd. It was a group hallucination which made them see acrawling kingsnakethat wasn't there.Whatever the truth, Jim was arrested again, tried and convicted of public exposure. This was the turning point for Morrison and the Doors. Bingeing on alcohol and drugs and constant partying after gigs wore Morrison out. His poor health was apparent onTHE SOFT PARADE-- you can hear it in his voice. By the timeL.A. WOMANwas recorded, Jim had ditched the tight leather pants, gained weight and grown a beard. It's suggested that he was trying to change his image. A move to Paris may have been more to escape time in a Florida jail than as a way to gain a lower profile, for even in the ""City of Lights"" Morrison was pursued by small crowds of fans.Of course there's clips of performances here (both great and awful) and the segment of Coppola'sAPOCALYPSE NOW(1978) that used ""The End"" as musical backdrop. For this Doors fan, the hour's best moments are when Robbie, John and Ray speak, for they are Jim Morrison's friends, colaborators and biggest supporters. Expect no answers in this program to the mystery that was Jim. Just enjoy the ride.",4,"""Life hurts a lot more than death. At the point of death, the pain is over.

687970,A2VKGFPYI51G1I,B00005V9HB,Gloom & Beauty,"[9, 14]","This documentary was out of print for many years! I think it's a superb Idea that it has been re-released again!Subtitled No One Here Gets Out Alive, this 1983 documentary is not without moments of nostalgic, credible insight; but for the most part it peddles out the checklist of every other bland paean to the Lizard King.Comprising a montage of interviews with the remaining band members (mullets, beachfronts, cane furniture and way too many &quot;man&quot; 's), the documentary is put together by celebrated biographers Jerry Hopkins, Danny Sugerman and former US Rolling Stone editor Ben Fong-Torres. This in mind, the disc should have been much more that a diluted and considerably less interesting abridged version of the Hopkins/Sugerman biography.The usual anecdotes and footage are here: the naughtiness of Ed Sullivan; the even more naughtiness of Miami. Yet the same times-they-were-a-changin' sentiments are conveyed ad nauseum: &quot;He was the real thing, man&quot;, &quot;He wanted to be a poet, man&quot;, &quot;He had a fire burning inside of him, man&quot;. Bad Morrison poetry floats across the screen, broody photo stills cut into each other... yawn.Like too many posthumous rock tributes, this is also prone to obscene exaggerations of the subject's cultural worth. In this example, Morrison's bloated and bearded downward spiral is rationalised as a mystical and powerful subversive statement. Dionysus is invoked, and everything about rock music is changed forever. Punk and new wave? A homage to Morrison, apparently. All the while archival footage plays of a stoned and barely coherent Jim.But still, it's pretty good!

687972,A1CQCS17LQCHIH,B00005V9HB,Jinkyu,"[1, 1]","""A Tribute to Jim Morrison"" is an aggregation of video clips and photos of Morrison and commentary from the three living Doors, two authors, and Doors producer Paul Rothchild.  It is a helpful introduction for someone who knows little about Morrison and wants to learn more.  However, because it dates back to the early 1980s, stalwart fans will find everything is old hat (e.g., The Doors landing in Europe and identifying themselves to the questioner; the performances in Europe and on the Ed Sullivan Show).In ""No One Here Gets Out Alive,"" Jerry Hopkins and Danny Sugerman (Editorial Review above, get that spelling right) wrote many things about Morrison, but their biography was most memorable for its focus on Morrison's wild antics, including many dangerous and gross things and acts of cruelty.  Most of the stories about wild antics were attributed to Sugerman, as Hopkins was the narrative and fact guy.  The difference on this DVD is that they stick to the more basic and general.  Although Morrison's excesses are acknowledged, the emphasis is on Jim Morrison the performer.  Indeed, a video clip is worth a thousand words.Nothing that Hopkins and Sugerman say is very profound or insightful.  Rothchild and the living Doors are more intelligent and interesting to listen to, but they do not dig deep enough into Morrison either.How could this have been more interesting?  The literary side of Jim Morrison could have been explored.  Jim was very well read, and some of his lyrics were inspired by his eclectic readings, including some French literature, for example.  Louis-Ferdinand Celine wrote ""Journey to the End of the Night"" (see The Doors' debut album track 9).  Arthur Rimbaud, French writer of the 19th century, had Morrison as one of his most prodigious readers, and Wallace Fowlie took the trouble to write ""Rimbaud and Jim Morrison:  The Rebel as Poet.""  As a performer, Jim Morrison was inspired by theatrical innovator Antonin Artaud, who wrote ""Theater of Cruelty.""  Also, Morrison had enough running around in his own head, helped by mind-altering substances, to inspire himself to great lyrics.  The creative stuff is perhaps beyond Hopkins and Sugerman, but not the three living Doors and some of Morrison's associates.Jim Morrison was not always a pleasant guy to know when drunk or stoned.  When he was not, I would have found him interesting to talk to, and I think many others would have as well.",3,In Want of the Deeper Caverns within Morrison,1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,2431,"['Tribute', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'aggregation', 'video', 'clips', 'photos', 'Morrison', 'commentary', 'three', 'living', 'Doors', 'two', 'authors', 'Doors', 'producer', 'Paul', 'Rothchild', 'helpful', 'introduction', 'someone', 'who', 'little', 'Morrison', 'learn', 'more', 'However', 'back', 'early', '1980s', 'stalwart', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'everything', 'old', 'hat', 'e.g.', 'Doors', 'landing', 'Europe', 'identifying', 'questioner', 'performances', 'Europe', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'Show', '.In', 'One', 'Here', 'Out', 'Alive', 'Jerry', 'Hopkins', 'Danny', 'Sugerman', 'Editorial', 'Review', 'get', 'spelling', 'right', 'wrote', 'many', 'things', 'Morrison', 'biography', 'was', 'most', 'memorable', 'focus', 'Morrison', 'wild', 'antics', 'including', 'many', 'dangerous', 'gross', 'things', 'acts', 'cruelty', 'Most', 'stories', 'wild', 'antics', 'were', 'attributed', 'Sugerman', 'Hopkins', 'was', 'narrative', 'fact', 'guy', 'difference', 'DVD', 'stick', 'more', 'basic', 'general', 'Morrison', 'excesses', 'are', 'acknowledged', 'emphasis', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'performer', 'Indeed', 'video', 'clip', 'thousand', 'words.Nothing', 'Sugerman', 'say', 'very', 'profound', 'insightful', 'Rothchild', 'living', 'Doors', 'are', 'more', 'intelligent', 'interesting', 'listen', 'do', 'not', 'dig', 'deep', 'enough', 'Morrison', 'either.How', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'literary', 'side', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'Jim', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'read', 'lyrics', 'were', 'inspired', 'eclectic', 'readings', 'including', 'French', 'literature', 'example', 'Louis-Ferdinand', 'Celine', 'wrote', 'Journey', 'End', 'Night', 'see', 'Doors', 'debut', 'track', '9', 'Arthur', 'Rimbaud', 'French', 'writer', '19th', 'century', 'had', 'Morrison', 'one', 'most', 'prodigious', 'readers', 'Wallace', 'Fowlie', 'took', 'trouble', 'write', 'Rimbaud', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Rebel', 'Poet', 'performer', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'was', 'inspired', 'theatrical', 'innovator', 'Antonin', 'Artaud', 'who', 'wrote', 'Theater', 'Cruelty', 'Also', 'Morrison', 'had', 'enough', 'running', 'around', 'own', 'head', 'helped', 'mind-altering', 'substances', 'inspire', 'great', 'lyrics', 'creative', 'stuff', 'perhaps', 'Hopkins', 'Sugerman', 'not', 'three', 'living', 'Doors', 'Morrison', 'associates.Jim', 'Morrison', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'pleasant', 'guy', 'know', 'when', 'drunk', 'stoned', 'When', 'was', 'not', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'interesting', 'talk', 'think', 'many', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'as', 'well']",N/A

But one forgets this was made in the early 80s, producer Paul Rothchild (who gives interesting insights into how The Doors influenced Punk and New Wave groups) has long passed away and Ray Manzarek, John Densmore and Robby Krieger are much older and probably have different opinions today than then about some things. Even the book this film is based on has been re-released with new additions. That is a major disappointment here, this DVD has no extra features, it is known there is a lot of Doors footage out there that hasn't been released in complete form as well as recordings (which the band is indeed releasing through their Bright Midnight record label), any true Doors fan already knows this DVD is a waste of cash when you can just go out and get &quot;The Doors Collection&quot; DVD, which is three hours of great footage, music videos and even audio commentary by the band members and extra features including Robby Krieger doing a new version of &quot;The End.&quot; This &quot;new&quot; release pales in comparison even to the &quot;The Doors: Live In Europe&quot; DVD.
