389894,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6303929974,Bobby Underwood,"[8, 8]","This film is a Christmas snowflake from the wonderful Deanna Durbin. She may have saved Universal from bankruptcy as a young musical sensation in the late 1930's, but by the mid 1940's she had matured into a pleasantly gorgeous actress who made several memorable light comedies. This breezy murder mystery is one of her best. The entire film takes place over the Christmas weekend and it is snowing in almost every shot, making a marvelous backdrop to this fun film.Nikki Collins (Deanna) is on a train bound for New York for the holidays. While reading a mystery by her favorite author, Wayne Morgan (David Bruce), she witnesses the murder of Josiah Warring from the window of her compartment. When no one will believe her, she hunts down mystery writer Morgan and slowly drags him into her enthusiastic search for the killer. He is engaged to a rather stuffy society babe, and we know right away that he and Durbin will end up together before the final curtain.The murdered man was a rich shipping magnate and when Durbin attempts to snoop around the tycoon's mansion she is mistaken by nephew Arnold (Dan Duryea) for Margo Martin, the nightclub singer to whom Josiah has left everything, much to the chagrin of everyone. This gives Durbin an opportunity to go to the nightclub and do some amateur detective work, as well as do a sexy rendition of ""Give Me a Little Kiss, Will Ya?"" and the lovely ""Night and Day"" while she pretends to be Margo.The real Margo gets murdered, of course, as does the owner of the swanky nightclub. And everyone seems to be after those blood stained slippers Nikki has found which prove the tycoon was really murdered. David Bruce does a nice job as the mystery writer Morgan as does Duryea as the black sheep of the family. Ralph Bellamy is fine as the good nephew. Edward Everett Horten gives a very funny performance as Mr. Haskell, who has been instructed to keep an eye on Durbin by her father, which proves to be a nearly impossible task!This is an entertaining muder mystery that is a lot of fun to watch. Deanna Durbin and the great cast make this film light and airy. She married director Charles David II later on and maybe that's part of the happiness you feel from the screen. We get to watch a glowing Durbin solve a murder, fall in love and sing some nice songs, all during a snowy Christmas weekend. What could be wrong with that?",5,A Durbin Snowflake,1112313600,"04 1, 2005",2005,2376,"['film', 'Christmas', 'snowflake', 'wonderful', 'Deanna', 'Durbin', 'may', 'have', 'saved', 'Universal', 'bankruptcy', 'young', 'musical', 'sensation', 'late', '1930', 'mid', '1940', 'had', 'matured', 'pleasantly', 'gorgeous', 'actress', 'who', 'made', 'several', 'memorable', 'light', 'comedies', 'breezy', 'murder', 'mystery', 'one', 'best', 'entire', 'film', 'place', 'Christmas', 'weekend', 'snowing', 'almost', 'shot', 'making', 'marvelous', 'backdrop', 'fun', 'film.Nikki', 'Collins', 'Deanna', 'train', 'bound', 'New', 'York', 'holidays', 'reading', 'mystery', 'favorite', 'author', 'Wayne', 'Morgan', 'David', 'Bruce', 'murder', 'Josiah', 'Warring', 'window', 'compartment', 'When', 'one', 'will', 'believe', 'down', 'mystery', 'writer', 'Morgan', 'slowly', 'drags', 'enthusiastic', 'search', 'killer', 'engaged', 'rather', 'stuffy', 'society', 'babe', 'know', 'right', 'away', 'Durbin', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'final', 'curtain.The', 'murdered', 'man', 'was', 'rich', 'shipping', 'magnate', 'when', 'Durbin', 'snoop', 'tycoon', 'mansion', 'mistaken', 'nephew', 'Arnold', 'Dan', 'Duryea', 'Margo', 'Martin', 'nightclub', 'singer', 'whom', 'Josiah', 'left', 'everything', 'much', 'chagrin', 'everyone', 'Durbin', 'opportunity', 'go', 'nightclub', 'do', 'amateur', 'detective', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'do', 'sexy', 'rendition', 'Give', 'Me', 'Little', 'Kiss', 'Will', 'Ya', 'lovely', 'Night', 'Day', 'be', 'Margo.The', 'real', 'Margo', 'murdered', 'course', 'owner', 'swanky', 'nightclub', 'everyone', 'be', 'blood', 'stained', 'slippers', 'Nikki', 'found', 'prove', 'tycoon', 'was', 'really', 'murdered', 'David', 'Bruce', 'nice', 'job', 'mystery', 'writer', 'Morgan', 'Duryea', 'black', 'sheep', 'family', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'fine', 'good', 'nephew', 'Edward', 'Everett', 'Horten', 'very', 'funny', 'performance', 'Mr.', 'Haskell', 'who', 'been', 'instructed', 'keep', 'eye', 'Durbin', 'father', 'be', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'task', 'entertaining', 'muder', 'mystery', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'Deanna', 'Durbin', 'great', 'cast', 'make', 'film', 'light', 'airy', 'married', 'director', 'Charles', 'David', 'II', 'later', 'maybe', 'part', 'happiness', 'feel', 'screen', 'get', 'watch', 'glowing', 'Durbin', 'solve', 'murder', 'fall', 'love', 'sing', 'nice', 'songs', 'snowy', 'Christmas', 'weekend', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'wrong']",Lady On A Train VHS

It happened in LADY ON A TRAIN, one of the most entertaining of all the movies Durbin starred during her Hollywood career.  Of course, the nightclub scenes allows Durbin to cut loose with sizzling numbers like ""Night and Day"".  Durbin's co-stars include Ralph Bellamy, Dan Duryea, Edward Everett Horton and Patricia Morison.

389898,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6303929974,C. O. DeRiemer,"[1, 1]","A film noir starring Deanna Durbin may seem as natural as eating an oyster with a splash of chocolate syrup, but if you're adventurous, well, somebody has to be the first to try it. Actually, the movie's a pleasant romp. Lady on a Train is a comedy mystery with some nice noir characteristics...shadows, trains, bodies and a climax in a darkened office building that would make Dick Powell feel right at home.Nikki Collins (Durbin) is a society deb from San Francisco coming in on the train for a visit to New York. As the train pulls into Grand Central, she casually looks out the window of her compartment and sees an elderly gentleman in an office across the way having his head bashed in by a crowbar-wielding murderer. She can see the victim's face, but not the assailant's. There are two things we need to know about Nikki. First, she's an energetic, confident young woman who is as determined as they come. Second, she loves mysteries. In fact, she was reading Wayne Morgan's ""The Case of the Headless Bride"" when she looked out the window. She goes to the police but they don't take her seriously. Plus, it's a few days before Christmas and no one is looking for more work than they already have. What's an heiress to do? Nikki looks up Morgan's address and pesters and prods him into using his skills as a detective to help find the killer. Nikki isn't fazed when Morgan (David Bruce) tries to tell her he's an author, he's shy, he's faint-hearted and he's no detective. She's determined to enlist his help, but in the meantime she's learned who the victim is, a very rich man. And she learns not only where he lived, but that his family is saying the man died accidently in a fall. So off she goes to the family mansion in the dead of night with snow starting to sift down...and just happens to be mistaken for Margo Martin, a singer at The Circus nightclub who was the ""fiance"" of the dead man. Wouldn't you know it, the old man's will leaves nothing to his two nephews, the eccentric and courtly Jonathan Waring (Ralph Bellamy) and the charming and untrustworthy Arnold Waring (Dan Duryea), but everything to Margo.Nikki has to deal with Danny, the Waring's thug of a chauffeur, and Mr. Saunders, the cold-eyed proprietor of The Circus who always carries a large white cat cradled in one arm. She finds she has to keep impersonating Margo, even if it means she has to sing ""Night and Day"" and ""Give Me a Little Kiss, Will You, Huh?"" as part of Margo's act. Tailing after her, like a small tug in the wake of a cruiser, is Morgan. I think they're starting to be attracted to each other.Up to now the movie has been amusing, light-weight and very much a vehicle for Deanna Durbin. She's no longer the little girl with a wonderful voice, as she was in the Thirties and Early Forties. She's a grown-up, and the studio is showing her off as a romantic lead who has a sense of humor. She's impeccably photographed, stylishly dressed and confident as all get out. It all pays off in the last 15 minutes when Nikki finds herself in the same office building where the killing took place. She's got both nephews looking for her, and one of them knows where the crowbar is hidden and intends to use it. There's the garage with the creaking car lift, the great storage floor where mounds of grain are piled, there are all the empty offices and hallways...and everything is dark and shadowed. Nikki keeps her cool, although she's quite happy when Morgan finally shows up to help save her. ""Oh, darling,"" she tells him afterwards, as he faints, ""you were wonderful."" Could the movie end without a marriage? And we know Deanna Durbin has grown up when, just before we see ""The End,"" there's a charming moment of sexual innuendo on the train taking Nikki and Morgan, newly married, to San Francisco.Deanna Durbin never seemed to take herself too seriously; she was always ready for a pratfall in the mud or a joke at her expense. She may not have had Judy Garland's overwhelming charisma, but she came close for a lot of people. More importantly, she didn't have Garland's edgy sense of an impending neurotic breakdown. Durbin was the girl next door with a sunny disposition, a great sense of humor and with a bit of the tomboy about her. In 1948, when she was 27, she announced her retirement. She and her husband, who directed this film, moved to France, where she still lives. She has never shown any interest in her movie-making past. She has never made another movie, has refused all requests for interviews and photographs, and has devoted herself to living a sane life. Good for her.The studio surrounded her in this film with some excellent character actors. In addition to Duryea and Bellamy, there's George Coulouris, Allen Jenkins, Edward Everett Horton, Samuel S. Hinds and William Frawley. And in a small role is Patricia Morrison, who three years later would be wowing the crowds singing ""I Hate Men!"" in Kiss Me Kate.This movie is available in a good-looking VHS tape and, on DVD, as part of the Deanna Durbin Sweetheart Pack.",4,"Deanna Durbin, grown up and starring in a sort of a noir, with comedy and murder.

This is a very entertaining blend of comedy and mystery, which was a vehicle to move singing star Durbin away from the romantic musicals she was hugely popular in. To ease the transition Durbin does sing three songs, which are spaced out well and aren't too obtrusive. The mystery is fun, there is some suspense, and Durbin is a very attractive lead.

The film may be of mild interest to film noir fans since it is a noir spoof, but this is primarily a lighthearted comedy that showcases Ms. Durbin's unaffected manner and singing talent.Nikki Collins (Deanna Durbin), a young society woman, witnesses a man being murdered from the window of her train as she is arriving in New York to spend the holidays with her aunt. After having no success convincing the conductor or the police to take the matter seriously, Nikki decides to enlist the aid of Wayne Morgan (David Bruce), a mystery novelist whose books she adores. Her persistence isn't getting her far when she sees a newsreel about the man she saw murdered. He was Josiah Waring, a wealthy ship-building magnate, who is reported to have died accidentally. She visits the Warings' Long Island estate in search of clues, where she is mistaken for the dead man's torch singer fianc&eacute;e by half of his family and suspected of being trouble by the other half. Now the murderers are on to her, the relatives believe she's someone she's not, and Mr. Morgan is annoyed but intrigued.Nikki's actions don't make much sense, but her plucky, mischievous, slightly bubble-headed persona are supposed to charm the audience as they charm the handsome Mr. Morgan. ""Lady on a Train"" is very much in the style of 1940s light comedy. The writing is not great. The personalities and comic situations are the entertainment. It either works for you or it doesn't. I think ""Lady on a Train"" would have benefitted from better dialogue, and I find the Nikki character a bit grating. But Deanna Durbin does sing three times, so this is a nice film for her fans. The story takes place on a snowy Christmas Eve in New York, so it's a fun Christmas film as well if you want something insubstantial.",3,Deanna Durbin Sings & Plays a Plucky Gal in this Mystery/Comedy.,1129593600,"10 18, 2005",2005,1975,"['Lady', 'Train', 'comic', 'mystery', 'starring', 'singer/actress', 'Deanna', 'Durbin', 'who', 'was', 'sensationally', 'popular', 'star', '1930s', '1940s', 'retiring', 'show', 'business', '1949', 'age', '27', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'mild', 'interest', 'film', 'noir', 'fans', 'noir', 'spoof', 'primarily', 'lighthearted', 'comedy', 'Ms.', 'Durbin', 'unaffected', 'manner', 'singing', 'talent.Nikki', 'Collins', 'Deanna', 'Durbin', 'young', 'society', 'woman', 'man', 'being', 'murdered', 'window', 'train', 'arriving', 'New', 'York', 'spend', 'holidays', 'aunt', 'having', 'success', 'convincing', 'conductor', 'police', 'take', 'matter', 'seriously', 'Nikki', 'enlist', 'aid', 'Wayne', 'Morgan', 'David', 'Bruce', 'mystery', 'novelist', 'books', 'persistence', ""n't"", 'getting', 'far', 'when', 'newsreel', 'man', 'saw', 'murdered', 'was', 'Josiah', 'Waring', 'wealthy', 'ship-building', 'magnate', 'who', 'reported', 'have', 'died', 'accidentally', 'Warings', 'Long', 'Island', 'estate', 'search', 'clues', 'where', 'mistaken', 'dead', 'man', 'torch', 'singer', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'e', 'half', 'family', 'suspected', 'being', 'trouble', 'other', 'half', 'Now', 'murderers', 'are', 'relatives', 'believe', 'someone', 'not', 'Mr.', 'Morgan', 'annoyed', 'intrigued.Nikki', 'actions', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'plucky', 'mischievous', 'slightly', 'bubble-headed', 'persona', 'are', 'supposed', 'charm', 'audience', 'charm', 'handsome', 'Mr.', 'Morgan', 'Lady', 'Train', 'very', 'much', 'style', '1940s', 'light', 'comedy', 'writing', 'not', 'great', 'personalities', 'comic', 'situations', 'are', 'entertainment', ""n't"", 'think', 'Lady', 'Train', 'would', 'have', 'benefitted', 'better', 'dialogue', 'find', 'Nikki', 'character', 'bit', 'grating', 'Deanna', 'Durbin', 'sing', 'three', 'times', 'nice', 'film', 'fans', 'story', 'place', 'snowy', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'New', 'York', 'fun', 'Christmas', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'want', 'something', 'insubstantial']",Lady On A Train VHS

Consequently, I had to watch the film on a Region 1 disc borrowed from a friend.  This is the first and only time I had this experience with a disc clearly marked Region 2 on its back cover and discovered why it was unwatchable on 2 DVD players I own.  With help from Amazon, I discovered the truth about Region 2, so buyers, beware.  I assume the seller will make good on a refund to me in the near future. I purchased this DVD through Amazon.But the film is worthwhile as a child singing-star transitions to a young woman who uncovers the murderer in a film noir that was the predominant style of film in 1945.

389906,A37S3ACL57LN62,6303929974,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[0, 0]","This story revolves around a girl (Deanna Durbin) who happens to witness what looks like a murder outside of her train window. However, the girl was reading a murder mystery novel on the train, and one suspects that her accusations may be the result of an active imagination. The police suspect the same thing, which forces her to go to the only other source of help she knows, the author of the murder mystery novel. This film is much more comical than thrilling fueled by the girl's eccentricity, but it is no less entertaining.Deanna Durbin is stunningly beautiful in this film. Her blonde hair shines in the soft lighting and she is obviously more grown up than in most of her films. She is still impulsive and charming, but her hair-brained schemes are executed with a subtle maturity. For once, Durbin looks like a gorgeous glamour girl of the era instead of a child star.The songs in this film are unusual for a Durbin film. Most of her songs in other films are quite juvenile like Judy Garland's, but those in this film are ones you might expect any adult to sing in a film. ""Silent Night"" is a song that is sung over a telephone. It is filed in soft lighting with Durbin's hair cascading over the bed like the glamorous Rita Hayworth. Although it is beautifully sung, the transition from dialogue to song is not very smooth. The next song is by far the best even though the title would suggest it is silly. ""Gimmie A Little Kiss, Will You Huh?"" is sung with the suggestiveness of a Marilyn Monroe song. The song is languid and underplayed. Needless to say, it is quite unlike anything one might expect from Durbin, but she does it so well, one wonders why these types of songs did not continue. The last song is ""Night and Day,"" a standard of the era. It employs some of Durbin's operatic training and is not as outstanding as the previous song, but it is a nice change of pace for the star.",4,I Wish There Was More,1128211200,"10 2, 2005",2005,1900,"['story', 'around', 'girl', 'Deanna', 'Durbin', 'who', 'witness', 'what', 'murder', 'train', 'window', 'However', 'girl', 'was', 'reading', 'murder', 'mystery', 'novel', 'train', 'one', 'accusations', 'may', 'be', 'result', 'active', 'imagination', 'police', 'suspect', 'same', 'thing', 'go', 'only', 'other', 'source', 'help', 'author', 'murder', 'mystery', 'novel', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'comical', 'thrilling', 'fueled', 'girl', 'eccentricity', 'less', 'entertaining.Deanna', 'Durbin', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'film', 'blonde', 'hair', 'shines', 'soft', 'lighting', 'obviously', 'more', 'grown', 'up', 'most', 'films', 'still', 'impulsive', 'charming', 'hair-brained', 'schemes', 'are', 'executed', 'subtle', 'maturity', 'once', 'Durbin', 'gorgeous', 'glamour', 'girl', 'era', 'instead', 'child', 'star.The', 'songs', 'film', 'are', 'unusual', 'Durbin', 'film', 'Most', 'songs', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'quite', 'juvenile', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'film', 'are', 'ones', 'might', 'expect', 'adult', 'sing', 'film', 'Silent', 'Night', 'song', 'sung', 'telephone', 'filed', 'soft', 'lighting', 'Durbin', 'hair', 'cascading', 'bed', 'glamorous', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'beautifully', 'sung', 'transition', 'dialogue', 'song', 'not', 'very', 'smooth', 'next', 'song', 'far', 'best', 'even', 'title', 'would', 'suggest', 'silly', 'Gimmie', 'A', 'Little', 'Kiss', 'Will', 'Huh', 'sung', 'suggestiveness', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'song', 'song', 'languid', 'underplayed', 'Needless', 'say', 'quite', 'anything', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'Durbin', 'so', 'well', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'types', 'songs', 'did', 'not', 'continue', 'last', 'song', 'Night', 'Day', 'standard', 'era', 'Durbin', 'operatic', 'training', 'not', 'as', 'outstanding', 'previous', 'song', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'star']",Lady On A Train VHS
