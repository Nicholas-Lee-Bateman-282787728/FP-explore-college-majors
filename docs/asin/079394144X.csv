""It's the minister!"" They scatter off. Is this the work of the devil? Betty is sick. The doctor is called but it is beyond his art. Are they bewitched? The turmoil in the village leads to a meeting. The Reverend Hale is coming to hunt for witches. Who is to blame? Will a romantic triangle create a jealous woman? Betty is examined for marks of the devil. The latest scientific information is used. Dancing around a fire at night? They blame Tituba! The third degree is applied to get a confession. Will she name names? Yes. The girls become a chorus in revealing names, like a chant.Many more are jailed and threatened with hanging. John and Elizabeth Proctor have a problem. A judge arrives with armed men. Some women are brought to court, others are arrested. They are threatened with hanging if they don't confess. Would a rich landowner buy up the property of those condemned whose property was forfeited? Are the judges fooled by these young girls and their spectral evidence? The devil is loose in Salem, where is he hiding? John Proctor threatens Abigail Williams. The arrested are brought into court for trial. Do they believe in witches? Are the young girls frauds? Those who protest will be arrested and examined for guilt. Giles Corey accuses Putnam of charging people so he can buy their lands. Witchcraft is an invisible crime and only the victim can testify; their actions are their corroborations. [Was this all a form of mass hysteria?]There is a showdown in court when Elizabeth Proctor is summoned to testify. Later the girls run into a stream [swimming?] and Mary Warren accuses John Proctor. The condemned are excommunicated and hanged. The crowd cheers at this gala festival! Giles Corey refuses to testify and is pressed to death (this saves his property from forfeiture). Abigail accuses the wife of the minister. Then she runs off with a large sum of money. [A comment on professional witnesses?] Will John Proctor confess to save his life and tell the court what it wants to hear? There is dramatic scene that is drawn out. The drama is heightened when things don't work out as expected. And so Justice is done to those who are in league with the devil.The film says ""The Salem witch hunt came to an end when people refused to save themselves by making a false confession"". The historical record says people were disgusted by the accusations made against good honest people who were above suspicion. This is such an excellent drama that you know it is not historically accurate. These trials show the importance of cross-examining witnesses and the need for corroboration. One strange part of this story is the lack of young men to match the many young girls in this drama. Some kind of a hidden message? The DVD has a conversation by Arthur Miller where he talks about 17th century Salem. Did this happen only in Salem? Witchcraft trials were in fashion during the 16th and 17th century Europe; they did not happen in Medieval Times. Popular hysteria and delusions are not limited to 17th century Salem. Was this drama an allegory for the witch hunts of the 1940s and 1950s? Or the Stalinist purges of the same era?

159589,AGEIT17HENDIS,079394144X,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","This film, based on the infamous Salem witch trials of the 1690's that New England still has not lived down, was written by Arthur Miller in an earlier period in American history, the 1950's, when hysteria over the alleged internal ""Communist menace"" dovetailed with the opening of the coldest part of the Cold War against the Soviet Union. The dramatic tension of the play cannot be understood except as a parable on that then current atmosphere. Miller draws parallels with the earlier period of hysteria, in this case the irrational hysteria over witches in the isolated, inward-looking Puritan community of Salem, Massachusetts. The comparisons in reaction to the witches and `reds under the bed' are startling as far as the response of the societies and individuals in those societies community were concerned. Obviously in the play one needs a hero, even if it is the flawed and `fallen' John Proctor who will stand up, in the final analysis, even unto death for his principles. We will always find a few, even if reluctant, fighters. What is more compelling, and frightening, is the reaction of the `honest' town folk. Then, as in the case of the Cold War hysteria, those `good' folk turned the other way, joined actively in on the action or in some way justified the trials. As we are again in a period when the new hysteria is over Islamic fundamentalists and their motives this remains an extremely powerful cautionary tale.

That includes the cast as well. Ryder has much more talent than she exibited in this movie.  So does Day-Lewis.  I studied the play years ago and saw the high school's senior AP English class put on the play and they did a much MUCH better job of it than I saw done here.  Since it is a play, I'm sure it's better seen as such, but Shakepeare's plays have been well adapted to film, so I don't know what the excuse is with The Crucible.  I thought the characters were too two demensional.  There was no depth in any of it.  I felt I was watching cardboard people trying to do justice to a great story.  I had no feelings whatsoever when John Proctor gave his ""It is my name"" speech.  That's the best part in the whole play.  Reading it evokes more feeling.  Goody Proctor was pathetic.  I couldn't even feel sorry for her. Abigail was wicked as ever, but I thought Ryder was a poor choice for the role.  The Crucible is a wonderful play and I highly recommend anyone to read it.

159595,A1GOI8745FGIDN,079394144X,"""an_avid_book_reviewer""","[3, 7]","When most people think of themes of this play, the nature of hysteria and the Communist &quot;witch hunts&quot; come to mind easily. A more important theme that less people will think of is the belief of life being a game. Society makes rules for us to follow. Although created for a reason, many of them will be stupid much of the time which means you either do what's right and suffer the social consequence or follow the stupid rule and get the social reward. The less realistic the rules are, the greater the gap between the &quot;game&quot; and doing what's right. In this story, that gap is wide, because the rule states that anyone denying accusations of practicing &quot;witchcraft&quot; would be hanged. As the story unfolds, we realize how stupid this rule is. Sure, it was intended to keep the Devil out of town but look what it really results in: People make frivolous accusations for revenge. People can be hanged for telling the truth. While admitting a false accusation, people use the chance to get revenge on someone else by saying they saw them with the Devil too, thus perpetuating this unjust social code. What makes this story great for this theme is that doing what is &quot;right&quot; and defying the social rules will cost your life. The message isn't delivered until the very end, when Proctor and the others are dangling from their nooses.Most people just play the game since it is the easiest way out and it seems to offer the best consequences. But John Proctor decided not to play the game, sacrificing his life for the truth rather than living with a lie. We may think that he was stupidly stubborn and should have just admitted the false accusation to live. His decision shows that the natural conseqences are often overlooked and outweigh the social consequences. In denying the false accusation, he and several others had to die but they eventually brought about the end to this unjust social system. As more and more people were protesting with their lives, the Puritan authorities were forced to change the system. Had everyone admitted the false accusations and &quot;played the game&quot;, no one would have died but the vicious cycle of lies, revenge, and defamation would have continued.Proctor nearly signed his name to the false accusation to spare his life. But when the judge told him he was posting it publicly, he decided that he wouldn't give away his name, or in other words, his INTEGRITY, even for his life. This reminds me of a convict I heard of who denied his guilt all through his jail term even though admitting his guilt for the plea bargain would have shortened his jail sentence, regarless of whether or not he was actually guilty. Sure, it could have been he was too stubborn or too deeply in denial to admit his guilt. But just maybe, I thought, he was like John Proctor. Usually, when a story is a movie based on a book, the book is more detailed, more thorough, more complex, and better. Often the book and movie even have differences in how the plot unfolds so it's really two different stories with the same name. But The Crucible is an exception. I think this is because it was the story itself that was great, not so much the writing. Besides, plays are written to be acted out on stage or for a movie, and not so much to be read straight.

Of course, having Paul Scofield, who is well known for his performance in A Man for All Seasons, elevates the film as a whole along with the help of Winona Ryder and Joan Allen. It's so much the acting as well as the script that make The Crucible a superb picture to watch.

What is so important about this account is the light it sheds on human interaction and the hypocrisy and betrayl that will lay manifest when put under pressure.  When a few young girls are accused of witchcraft they will stop at nothing to resume innocence, even if that means falsly accusing their fellow man resulting in 19 murders (by hanging) of innocent men and women.  The film follows Abigail Williams (Ryder) as her love and or lust for John (Day-Lewis) moves her to accuse his wife Elizabeth (Joan Allen in SUCH A COMMANDING ROLE!) of witchcraft in an effort to have her hung and John be all to herself.  In the meantime countless others are falsly accused and brought under trial as well.  The film shows well how selfish and unjust man can be, not to mention naive and downright ignorent when it comes to pride and prejudice!  Despite the lack of proof surrounding the claims of witchcraft and the abounding proof substanciating the fact these were all fabricated lies the courts still put to death 19 innocent people.  Townsfolk were turning on their friends and neighbors for anything from land to lovers, accusing their friends of witchcraft in order for their land and livestock to become availiable to them.  It became a game, a game of 'who-can-we-get-next' and the courts fell for it, or got swept up in it to say the least.  Let's just hope and pray another tragedy like this never befalls us again.  Who can you trust when everyone (better yet 'anyone') could have your life with one lie...Better still I wanted to make mention of the whole 'name' speach that John gives at the end of the film.  I don't want to give away the climax, but I will say that John makes mention of his name, that he doesn't want to tarnish his name but agreeing to lies made against him.  This is a strong arguement made throughout this film, the question beiong raised as to whether god would fair worse on the liar (those who agreed to the false accusations made against them in order to be spared of a hanging) or those who stood their ground and refused to be labeled a witch, knowing full well they would be hung for it.  One of the ministers says ""the most precious gift god gave us is life"" and then proceeds to say that god may fair better with those who lie to save it.  Whether this is the case or not, whatever your belief on the matter, it is a good point to make and somthing to think about.  We all know what the bible lays claim to as sins, and yet we all have our ideas of what constitutes a sin...but what separates a sin from foolish pride.  Is is pridefull of these men and woman to make martyrs or themselves in order to keep a clean name or is it rightous of them to stay clean before god by refusing the sin or a false tounge even though it presents an easy way out?  It's worth a thought and thinking about that and in the end the choices made by those men and woman will help us all to appreciate better the reasons this film is so important.",5,Cries of Injustice!,1149120000,"06 1, 2006",2006,3224,"['What', 'so', 'haunting', ""'The"", 'Crucible', 'fact', 'sub-plot', 'young', 'woman', 'trying', 'gain', 'entry', 'married', 'mans', 'heart', 'may', 'be', 'fictitous', 'initial', 'story', 'Salem', 'Witch', 'Hunts', '1692', 'true', 'friends', 'such', 'tragedy', 'What', 'so', 'important', 'account', 'light', 'human', 'interaction', 'hypocrisy', 'betrayl', 'will', 'lay', 'manifest', 'when', 'put', 'pressure', 'When', 'few', 'young', 'girls', 'are', 'accused', 'witchcraft', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'resume', 'innocence', 'even', 'falsly', 'accusing', 'fellow', 'man', 'resulting', '19', 'murders', 'hanging', 'innocent', 'men', 'women', 'film', 'Abigail', 'Williams', 'Ryder', 'love', 'lust', 'John', 'Day-Lewis', 'accuse', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'SUCH', 'A', 'COMMANDING', 'ROLE', 'witchcraft', 'effort', 'have', 'hung', 'John', 'be', 'meantime', 'countless', 'others', 'are', 'falsly', 'accused', 'brought', 'trial', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'well', 'how', 'selfish', 'unjust', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'not', 'mention', 'naive', 'downright', 'ignorent', 'when', 'pride', 'prejudice', 'lack', 'proof', 'surrounding', 'claims', 'witchcraft', 'abounding', 'proof', 'substanciating', 'fact', 'were', 'fabricated', 'courts', 'still', 'put', 'death', '19', 'innocent', 'people', 'Townsfolk', 'were', 'turning', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'anything', 'land', 'lovers', 'accusing', 'friends', 'witchcraft', 'order', 'land', 'livestock', 'become', 'availiable', 'became', 'game', 'game', ""'who-can-we-get-next"", 'courts', 'fell', 'got', 'swept', 'up', 'say', 'least', 'Let', 'just', 'hope', 'pray', 'tragedy', 'never', 'again', 'Who', 'can', 'trust', 'when', 'everyone', 'better', 'yet', ""'anyone"", 'could', 'have', 'life', 'one', 'lie', 'Better', 'still', 'wanted', 'make', 'mention', 'whole', ""'name"", 'speach', 'John', 'end', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'climax', 'will', 'say', 'John', 'mention', 'name', ""n't"", 'want', 'tarnish', 'name', 'agreeing', 'lies', 'made', 'strong', 'arguement', 'made', 'film', 'question', 'beiong', 'raised', 'god', 'would', 'fair', 'worse', 'liar', 'who', 'agreed', 'false', 'accusations', 'made', 'order', 'be', 'spared', 'hanging', 'who', 'stood', 'ground', 'refused', 'be', 'labeled', 'witch', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'would', 'be', 'hung', 'One', 'ministers', 'most', 'precious', 'gift', 'god', 'gave', 'life', 'then', 'proceeds', 'say', 'god', 'may', 'fair', 'better', 'who', 'lie', 'save', 'Whether', 'case', 'not', 'whatever', 'belief', 'matter', 'good', 'point', 'make', 'somthing', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'bible', 'lays', 'claim', 'sins', 'yet', 'have', 'ideas', 'what', 'sin', 'what', 'sin', 'foolish', 'pride', 'pridefull', 'men', 'woman', 'make', 'martyrs', 'order', 'keep', 'clean', 'name', 'rightous', 'stay', 'clean', 'god', 'refusing', 'sin', 'false', 'tounge', 'even', 'easy', 'way', 'thought', 'thinking', 'end', 'choices', 'made', 'men', 'woman', 'will', 'help', 'appreciate', 'better', 'reasons', 'film', 'so', 'important']",N/A

Hoodwinked by a bunch of flighty teenage  girls who wished to escape a whipping for their frolics in the woods, the  town brought in the colony magistrates to sort out the devils from the  angels.Miller, who also wrote the screenplay, expresses his blatant  contempt for hypocrisy in all forms through the character of John Proctor  (Daniel Day-Lewis), a humble but once-adulterous farmer. Proctor's sexual  escapades with the town's main accuser Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder)  could, through the girl's treachery, end in his wife's hanging. He can  either save himself with a lie or free Elizabeth (Joan Allen) with the  truth about himself and Abigail.It's potent stuff any way you slice it,  and the actors here aren't afraid to take big bites of their meaty roles.  The film's pacing is fast and furious, hysterical like the history of the  event it interprets. If it lacks the McCarthyist subtext it once had, so  what. This here's a tragedy--a good old American one.The movie's  inevitable ending won't satisfy those who want only fluff and feathers at  the cinema, but the hard lesson won by those who refuse to compromise their  principles can't be denied.

I am not usually into period pieces (except isolated exceptions), but found this one interesting from a psychological and sociological perspective.The performances are excellent, and the scene where Daniel Day Louis refuses to hand over the paper with his name is one of the most memorable, executed with a true, gut wrenching genuineness. The characters manage to conjure (no pun intended) sympathy and hatred from the audience, and despite the fact that I am not a huge fan of Winona Ryder, this was my favorite performance.The story of betrayal, mass hysteria and persecutation still resonates with many ""scapegoating"" circumstances today and and historically, and the choices faced by the characters (John Proctor to live or die, his wife's struggle to forgive and attempt to save him, and Abigail's decision to dance a fine line between good and evil), is very powerful.Like the media today, which sometimes presents events in a very slanted, and pigeonholed manner, the citizens of the town, saw the events with the same narrow knowledge base. In addition, they were blinded by their strict life style, condemnation of all that was ""different"", and lack of exposure to alternate explanations. It reminded me of other religious fanaticism experienced throughout history (Spanish Inquisition, etc).The depiction of heroism, and what it means to remain true to oneself (as John Proctor) did, was admirable and genuine. Despite facing certain death, his honor and transference of land to his family was more importanht. It was as if with his death, he was also absolving himself from his guilt in betraying his wife,  and would in effect be free of the extreme societal constrictions.Excellent film-worth discussion and comparison to contemporary society.",4,A story of commitment to oneself,1225670400,"11 3, 2008",2008,1845,"['watched', 'film', 'part', 'college', 'friends', 'book', 'club', 'are', 'now', '30', 'am', 'not', 'usually', 'period', 'pieces', 'isolated', 'exceptions', 'found', 'one', 'interesting', 'psychological', 'sociological', 'perspective.The', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'scene', 'where', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Louis', 'hand', 'paper', 'name', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'executed', 'true', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'genuineness', 'characters', 'manage', 'conjure', 'pun', 'intended', 'sympathy', 'hatred', 'audience', 'fact', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'was', 'favorite', 'performance.The', 'story', 'betrayal', 'mass', 'hysteria', 'persecutation', 'still', 'many', 'scapegoating', 'circumstances', 'today', 'historically', 'choices', 'faced', 'characters', 'John', 'Proctor', 'live', 'die', 'wife', 'struggle', 'forgive', 'attempt', 'save', 'Abigail', 'decision', 'dance', 'fine', 'line', 'good', 'evil', 'very', 'media', 'today', 'presents', 'events', 'very', 'slanted', 'pigeonholed', 'manner', 'citizens', 'town', 'saw', 'events', 'same', 'narrow', 'knowledge', 'base', 'addition', 'were', 'blinded', 'strict', 'life', 'style', 'condemnation', 'was', 'different', 'lack', 'exposure', 'alternate', 'explanations', 'reminded', 'other', 'religious', 'fanaticism', 'experienced', 'history', 'Spanish', 'Inquisition', 'etc', 'depiction', 'heroism', 'what', 'remain', 'true', 'oneself', 'John', 'Proctor', 'did', 'was', 'admirable', 'genuine', 'facing', 'certain', 'death', 'honor', 'transference', 'land', 'family', 'was', 'more', 'importanht', 'was', 'death', 'was', 'also', 'absolving', 'guilt', 'betraying', 'wife', 'would', 'effect', 'be', 'free', 'extreme', 'societal', 'constrictions.Excellent', 'film-worth', 'discussion', 'comparison', 'contemporary', 'society']",N/A

159617,A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,079394144X,Draconis Blackthorne,"[1, 8]","A highly dramatic & disturbing film demonstrating christian lunacy if it goes unchecked. The classic account of the Salem Witch Tryals - this, perhaps one of the better ones, as it does not pander nor apologize for the alexithymic disease of the blindlight.To those under the delusion that children do not lie {if 'Michelle Remembers' & Wenatchee, WA are any indication}, this film accurately portrays the self-righteous, hypocritical, corruption besetting the peasantly christians at that Puritanical tyme, with all its stuporstitious finger-pointing & paranoiac insanity, demonstrated by three little girls who, in order to avoid punishment, begin creating lies about several townspeople who are subsequently hanged at the gallows, & for a tyme, caused an hysteria wherein neighbors accused neighbors, for more spiteful reasons & jealousy issues, than actual diabolism.So what was the true evil occurring in Salem? christian repression & false accusations fostered by children. The peasants needed some sort of excuse to break free of their doldrums, so the first thing that came along - the ""crime of witchcraft"" - became a venue to express all those sublimated desires of bloodlust - they needed to see & experience some sort of excitement , & so of course, they turned to The Devil for it. In this case, again, as representing all their sublimated animal desires.Repression / Abstinence only leads to aberrant behaviour; as is evidenced in that era in history, as well as modern-day priests who molest altar boys & preachers who turn to prostitutes for an outlet.Nowadays, the christian crutch must still preserve its fearful hold on its sheeple, but it is done in more covert means, while still maintaining guilt-inducements based on fear.Also, even in this movie, not to mention books on the subject which have been available for three centuries now, it is plainly related that no real witches were ever burned at the stake, hanged, or given ""the test"" {that is, thrown into a lake to see whether she floats or sinks} - but rather these crimes were perpetrated against the common folk - so, weakans, as common as they are, have no basis in fact claiming the so-called ""burning times"" as relative.As a matter if fact, the Magistrates themselves could even be seen as rather `satanic' characters - that is, they formed their own realities to enforce their particular views & gratify their lusts. I would rather have been an Inquisitor, or Magistrate, than a peasant any day! They were the ones who held the power, influence, the law-makers who were the directors of people's fates. The veritable Pontius Pilates of the period. And as we know, the true witches were sleeping with them!So Abigail Folger {played by the succulent Wynona Ryder} was the major instigator, primarily accusing poor Tutuba, the well-meaning black slave woman, along with a slew of others, just so that she would not be blamed. Surely, a practice in self-preservation, but without acknowledging personal responsibility, blaming `the devil' in classic christian style.John Proctor & his wife  are portrayed as the most noble characters herein, as even unto the bitter end, he refuses to submit to the ""Witch-Fynder Generale's"" wishes - he just could not stomach the erzatz ""confession"" he was forced to make - damned if you do, damned if you don't. In the end, he is hanged with some others, as they pathetically utter `The Lord's Prayer' until hanging by the neck.Overall, The Crucuble is recommended as a study into the blood-soaked christian history, as a  misanthropological ponderation, lest it be conveniently forgotten, or at all forgiven.",4,Stuporstition...,1116115200,"05 15, 2005",2005,3624,"['highly', 'dramatic', 'disturbing', 'film', 'demonstrating', 'christian', 'lunacy', 'unchecked', 'classic', 'account', 'Salem', 'Witch', 'Tryals', 'perhaps', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'not', 'pander', 'apologize', 'alexithymic', 'disease', 'blindlight.To', 'delusion', 'children', 'do', 'not', 'lie', ""'Michelle"", 'Remembers', 'Wenatchee', 'WA', 'are', 'indication', 'film', 'accurately', 'self-righteous', 'hypocritical', 'corruption', 'besetting', 'peasantly', 'Puritanical', 'tyme', 'stuporstitious', 'finger-pointing', 'paranoiac', 'insanity', 'demonstrated', 'three', 'little', 'girls', 'who', 'order', 'avoid', 'punishment', 'begin', 'creating', 'lies', 'several', 'townspeople', 'who', 'are', 'subsequently', 'hanged', 'gallows', 'tyme', 'caused', 'hysteria', 'wherein', 'neighbors', 'accused', 'neighbors', 'more', 'spiteful', 'reasons', 'jealousy', 'issues', 'actual', 'diabolism.So', 'what', 'was', 'true', 'evil', 'occurring', 'Salem', 'christian', 'repression', 'false', 'accusations', 'fostered', 'children', 'peasants', 'needed', 'sort', 'excuse', 'break', 'free', 'doldrums', 'first', 'thing', 'came', 'along', 'crime', 'witchcraft', 'became', 'venue', 'express', 'sublimated', 'desires', 'bloodlust', 'needed', 'see', 'experience', 'sort', 'excitement', 'so', 'course', 'turned', 'Devil', 'case', 'again', 'representing', 'sublimated', 'animal', 'desires.Repression', '/', 'Abstinence', 'only', 'aberrant', 'behaviour', 'evidenced', 'era', 'history', 'as', 'well', 'modern-day', 'priests', 'who', 'molest', 'altar', 'boys', 'preachers', 'who', 'turn', 'prostitutes', 'outlet.Nowadays', 'christian', 'crutch', 'must', 'still', 'preserve', 'fearful', 'hold', 'sheeple', 'done', 'more', 'covert', 'means', 'still', 'maintaining', 'guilt-inducements', 'based', 'fear.Also', 'even', 'movie', 'not', 'mention', 'books', 'subject', 'have', 'been', 'available', 'three', 'centuries', 'now', 'plainly', 'related', 'real', 'witches', 'were', 'ever', 'burned', 'stake', 'hanged', 'given', 'test', 'thrown', 'lake', 'see', 'sinks', 'rather', 'crimes', 'were', 'perpetrated', 'common', 'folk', 'so', 'weakans', 'as', 'common', 'are', 'have', 'basis', 'fact', 'claiming', 'so-called', 'burning', 'times', 'relative.As', 'matter', 'fact', 'Magistrates', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'seen', 'rather', 'satanic', 'characters', 'formed', 'own', 'realities', 'enforce', 'particular', 'views', 'gratify', 'lusts', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'been', 'Inquisitor', 'Magistrate', 'peasant', 'day', 'were', 'ones', 'who', 'held', 'power', 'influence', 'law-makers', 'who', 'were', 'directors', 'people', 'fates', 'veritable', 'Pontius', 'Pilates', 'period', 'know', 'true', 'witches', 'were', 'sleeping', 'So', 'Abigail', 'Folger', 'played', 'succulent', 'Wynona', 'Ryder', 'was', 'major', 'instigator', 'primarily', 'accusing', 'poor', 'Tutuba', 'well-meaning', 'black', 'slave', 'woman', 'slew', 'others', 'just', 'so', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'blamed', 'Surely', 'practice', 'self-preservation', 'acknowledging', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'blaming', 'devil', 'classic', 'christian', 'style.John', 'Proctor', 'wife', 'are', 'portrayed', 'most', 'noble', 'characters', 'herein', 'even', 'bitter', 'end', 'submit', 'Witch-Fynder', 'Generale', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'stomach', 'erzatz', 'confession', 'was', 'forced', 'make', 'damned', 'do', 'damned', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'hanged', 'others', 'pathetically', 'utter', 'Lord', 'Prayer', 'hanging', 'neck.Overall', 'Crucuble', 'recommended', 'study', 'blood-soaked', 'christian', 'history', 'misanthropological', 'ponderation', 'lest', 'be', 'conveniently', 'forgotten', 'forgiven']",N/A

What the work loses in its claustrophobic atmosphere of being primarily in a courtroom, it gains in its hysteria-laden tone. Sometimes this works (Abigail's chilling screams in the courtroom have an eerie mood to them), and sometimes this goes to excess (case in point: Mrs. Putnam's screams are overtly hysterical to the point of overkill).Still, bringing the play to film does have its advantages over all. We get to see the Puritan town of Salem, and the people who move about through place to place. The few scenes between Abigail and Proctor make their past history a little more apparent, and this helps in illustrating Elizabeth's cause for concern and her lack of trust in the initial part of the film. And, other parts of the play just work well outside, one of the best being Mary Warren screaming wildly after the girls turn on her, in which she frantically runs to the water and screams out against Proctor.I had viewed this movie once before, thinking it quite mediocre at film's end, but, years later, watching it again, have a better appreciation for it. The film's intensity really picks up in the second half of the movie, particularly in Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of John Proctor. One of the film's climactic moments, when Proctor gives his ""Because it's my name!..."" speech to Danforth, is perhaps the most impressive and dramatic of all the film's scenes.Written as a reaction to the McCarthy trials, The Crucible's literal witch hunts are somewhat bizarre and somewhat chilling, and this film successfully and succinctly captures this mood. While this film is not a work of art, and certainly has some ""Hollywood"" in it, it is a satisfactory retelling in the long run.The DVD version also includes an interview and behind the scenes between Arthur Miller and Daniel Day Lewis.

While some may make negative comparisons between the power of the theatrical piece versus the immediacy of the film, it really matters little.  The story, based on fact, is terrifying and all too familiar in flavor with the Inquisition, the Holocaust, the witch hunts of McCarthy's time, the misdeeds of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, NSA wiretapping etc.  Evil is evil and it must be addressed, and if this play/film helps us to recognize the madness of lies then it has served its purpose.The story is so well known that recounting it is superfluous: Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) seethes as the discarded harlot who slept with the noble John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis) and gains her revenge by naming Proctor's wife Elizabeth (Joan Allen) as a witch - a person who walks and communicates with the devil!  As the disease of repression and  superstition mounts,  the citizenry of Salem calls in Judge Danforth (Paul Scofield) to try the accusations, and needless hangings of innocent victims occur until some semblance of reason is restored by John Proctor's fight for truth at the hanging post.As directed by Nicholas Hytner and photographed by Andrew Dunn, the dark atmosphere of Salem's dance with the devil is brilliantly captured.  The cast is excellent, not only the stars (Day-Lewis, Scofield, Allen, Ryder), but also the multiple well realized small roles.

The story also concerns an unfaithful man (John Proctor) who cheated on his good and modest wife with a calculating and obsessive young hussy played perfectly by the character of Winona Ryder. But he loves his wife and turns away from the hussy, who then takes her revenge. John is publicly made to pay for his private sins, and asked to sign a humiliating confession that will destroy his reputation as it is going to be posted on the church door for all to read. In order to save his life, he signs his name to the confession and gives up his soul to his inquisitors, but the confession is a lie because he was never a witch. In a heart-wrenching scene where he changes his mind, he shrieks: ""I sign myself to lies!"" and he pleads: ""I have given you my soul!... please leave me my good name!"" He rips up the signed false confession and seals his doom.I was very pleased with the sad and moving ending. I hope the viewing public understands the powerful paradox of it--the good true Christian people being falsely accused and hanged for witchcraft while their satanic accusers and evilly misled inquisitors look on along with a mournful, remorseful crowd. The scene at the very end with the Lord's prayer was a poignant touch. I'm glad the director had the courage to give it, as usually Hollywood plays it safe by providing the ""happy ending"", whether it fits or not.

Joseph McCarthy is on a rampange to ""clean America"" of communists, homosexuals, and anything else deemed to threaten the fabric of our nation. People are in an uproar, willing to name names and blacklist anyone possibly associated with Communism. Lives are destroyed, careers are ruined. Arthur Miller's answer: write a play, in the form of The Crucible. What's amazing is how a play about an outrageous event in the late 1600's, in response to an outragous event in the 1950's, is so terribly relevant today.Arthur Miller penned the screenplay for this movie, based on his own play. Made into a movie in 1996, the reviews were tepid at best.Yet I recall fondly sitting in the theater, absolutely transfixed at the story, knowing I was seeing a classic in front of me. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, the Crucible is both visually stunning and a slave to a great story with great characters. John Proctor is played flawlessly by Daniel Day-Lewis, a man with a past who regrets his actions and loves his family. Equally flawless is the never-go-wrong Joan Allen, playing his always truthful wife Emily. Caught in the web of their family is young Abagail Williams, acted by a never better Winona Ryder, who loves John and in doing so, tries to destroy his family.Events of the story get set into motion immediately, by a group of young girls who venture out into the evening to create a magical potions to conjure the affections of the town's boys. What transpires from there, things grow quickly and blatantly out of control, as innocent person after innocent person is flung into the pit of suspicion, based on the heresay of a few imporessionable girls. Miller balances perfectly the trial of suspicions with the unfolding drama of a family unraveling, creating a mesmerizing piece.Even moreso, the Crucible is a tale for today. How many elements in our own society today would be willing to sell out some of our lesser folks to create a safer place? Listen very carefully to Hytner's commentary track on the DVD, which is informative and wise. He hits the nail on the head during the final, heartbreaking scene. The message of this play, the message of this movie, shall never become obsolete, as long as we have people in our society who unfairly judge others on the altar of righteousness.The Crucible demands repeated viewings for excellent acting, intense drama, and a visually beautiful film to watch, as well as a lesson for us all.",5,Prone to this,1112572800,"04 4, 2005",2005,2492,"['Flashback', '1950', 'are', 'beseiged', 'Sen.', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'rampange', 'clean', 'America', 'communists', 'homosexuals', 'anything', 'else', 'deemed', 'threaten', 'fabric', 'nation', 'People', 'are', 'uproar', 'willing', 'name', 'names', 'blacklist', 'anyone', 'possibly', 'associated', 'Communism', 'Lives', 'are', 'destroyed', 'careers', 'are', 'ruined', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'answer', 'write', 'play', 'form', 'Crucible', 'What', 'amazing', 'how', 'play', 'outrageous', 'event', 'late', '1600', 'response', 'outragous', 'event', '1950', 'so', 'terribly', 'relevant', 'today.Arthur', 'Miller', 'penned', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'based', 'own', 'play', 'Made', 'movie', '1996', 'reviews', 'were', 'tepid', 'best.Yet', 'recall', 'fondly', 'sitting', 'theater', 'absolutely', 'transfixed', 'story', 'knowing', 'was', 'seeing', 'classic', 'front', 'Directed', 'Nicholas', 'Hytner', 'Crucible', 'visually', 'stunning', 'slave', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'characters', 'John', 'Proctor', 'played', 'flawlessly', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'man', 'past', 'who', 'actions', 'family', 'Equally', 'flawless', 'never-go-wrong', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'playing', 'always', 'truthful', 'wife', 'Emily', 'Caught', 'web', 'family', 'young', 'Abagail', 'Williams', 'acted', 'never', 'better', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'who', 'John', 'doing', 'so', 'tries', 'destroy', 'family.Events', 'story', 'get', 'set', 'motion', 'immediately', 'group', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'venture', 'out', 'evening', 'create', 'magical', 'potions', 'conjure', 'affections', 'town', 'boys', 'What', 'there', 'things', 'grow', 'quickly', 'blatantly', 'control', 'innocent', 'person', 'innocent', 'person', 'flung', 'pit', 'suspicion', 'based', 'heresay', 'few', 'imporessionable', 'girls', 'Miller', 'perfectly', 'trial', 'suspicions', 'unfolding', 'drama', 'family', 'unraveling', 'creating', 'mesmerizing', 'piece.Even', 'moreso', 'Crucible', 'tale', 'today', 'How', 'many', 'elements', 'own', 'society', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'sell', 'out', 'lesser', 'folks', 'create', 'safer', 'place', 'Listen', 'very', 'carefully', 'Hytner', 'commentary', 'track', 'DVD', 'informative', 'wise', 'nail', 'head', 'final', 'heartbreaking', 'scene', 'message', 'play', 'message', 'movie', 'shall', 'never', 'become', 'obsolete', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'people', 'society', 'who', 'unfairly', 'judge', 'others', 'altar', 'righteousness.The', 'Crucible', 'demands', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'excellent', 'acting', 'intense', 'drama', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'film', 'watch', 'as', 'well', 'lesson']",N/A

The story is based on Arthur Miller's rendition of the infamous 1692 Salem witch trials.  In this Puritan town, a group of girls are caught dancing and love-spell casting in the woods.  To save themselves from being whipped, they claim it was the Devil's doing and furthermore that some of Salem's residents are compacted with Lucifer.  But private vengeance is also at work here.  The girls' ringleader, Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) is obsessed with a local farmer (Daniel Day-Lewis) and will stop at nothing to get him for herself.  Then the court investigating the claims of witchery begins to proscribe hanging for those who won't 'confess'. . . . . . . . . .It is unfortunate then, that a movie such as this is marred by several flaws.  While it vividly and unnervingly portrays the transformation of a community into warring factions, and ultimately the disintegration into mob-mentality and mass hysteria, it also seems very stagey.  You can almost see the notations in the film script - &quot;crowd murmurs in agreement&quot;, and so on.  Additionally, Day-Lewis, and particularly Ryder, play the entire film at full volume.  Thus, several integral speeches get lost in the blast.  However, there are some excellent performances from those in the court scenes - the steely remorselessness of Judge Danforth and the pompous and insidious questioning of Judge Hathorne.  Fortunately director Nicholas Hytner has moved as much of the action as possible out of doors, which is just as well, for Puritan dwellings are no great objects of beauty.However, despite its shortcomings and largely unadventurous cinematography, The Crucible is a film that will remain with the viewer long after its dramatic and memorable conclusion.

159633,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,079394144X,Josh Hitchens,"[6, 6]","Arthur Miller's THE CRUCIBLE is one of the best plays that I have ever read, and now it is one of the best films I've ever seen. Although the action is a little shaky in the beginning, the pace picks up when the trials begin. It may be wise to read the play first to understand the background of the various characters. THE CRUCIBLE is the story of the Salem Witch trials of 1692. To me it shows the tragedy of the human condition. The people of Salem really hate one another, as Abigail points out, but because of their Puritan faith they must repress their emotions.Winona Ryder succeeds marvelously as Abigail Williams. Abigail is selfish and deluded into thinking that she loves married John Procter, with whom she had an affair. Abigail &quot;means to dance with John on his wife's grave&quot; and she will stop at nothing to have him, even when she accuses innocent people of witchcraft. She has no idea of the enormous consequences of her actions. Towards the films end, she comes to John Procter in jail hoping that he will go with her on a ship to America. Her pleading, &quot;I never dreamed this for you,&quot; is a true one. But John Procter replies aptly by saying that the only time they will meet again is in hell. Abigail then disappears, never to be seen again.Daniel Day-Lewis is superb as John Procter. He is a man of reason who is faced with an impossible choice. He either must give into the lie and save his life, or remain silent. His final &quot;Give me my name&quot; speech will have you in tears.Joan Allen is great as Elizabeth, Procter's frigid wife. Her breakdown at the end also induces some tears.

Miller himself wrote the screenplay for it, so it is no wonder that the story told by the film is relatively faithful to the play. Coupled with the capable direction of Nicholas Hynter, as well as a stellar cast, the play successfully makes the transition from stage to celluloid.The movie recounts a fictionalized version of the famous Salem, Massachusetts witch trials of 1692, which saw quite a number of of the town's citizens executed for witchcraft. Winona Ryder is excellent as Abigail Williams, the poor relation of the town's craven minister, well played by Bruce Davison. Dancing with other young women around a camp fire in the woods one evening, she is surprised by the intrusion of the minister into their festivities. He is just as surprised as they are. The young women are in terror of having been caught doing something forbidden to them, and the games begin.&quot;The devil made me do it!&quot; becomes the rallying cry of the day, as the young women begin pointing the finger at those townsfolk, who in some measure have come under their unfavorable scrutiny. Beginning with Tituba, the slave, who is the first to fall, the circle of those accused widens under the careful leadership of Abigail. She ultimately sets her sights on Elizabeth Proctor, the prim wife of John Proctor, played with icy calm by Joan Allen, for whom she had previously worked and from whose employ she had been dismissed, as Mrs. Proctor had rightly suspected her of having an affair with her husband, John. Abigail still lusts mightily for John, who has spurned her subsequent overtures and advances. She, who has been nothing, has suddenly been empowered in such a way that what she desires may be only an accusation away from being hers, or so Abigail thinks.John Proctor, wonderfully portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis, is a taciturn everyman, who does not traffic too much with the townfolk. As witch mania grips the town, however, he becomes more vocal. When his wife is taken into custody on a charge of witchcraft, he can no longer keep silent. He comes to her defense in full fury at the injustice done to his wife and the other poor souls unjustly accused of witchcraft and trafficking with the devil, only to ultimately be done in by love and his own integrity.It is almost hard to believe that such an event as the Salem witch trials ever really took place, but truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.

I really feel the Cruicible manages to get all of those components right to form an incredible movie that gains in value from each rewatching.First, the plot. Daniel is John Proctor, a man in 1600s Salem, Massachusetts who has been unfaithful to his wife. He slept with the teen girl Abigail (Winona Ryder). Although the affair is over, things are still not good in John's home. Abigail still pines for John. So when a group of girls go out to dance in the woods and cast love potions, Abigail wishes for John's wife to die.The girls are caught by the minister, accusations of witchcraft begin to surface, and to divert suspicion the teen girls begin to accuse other women in the neighborhood of being witches. A full blown witch hunt begins, and many women are killed based solely on the accusations of the group of teens. This is, sadly, all very true.The play, by Arthur Miller, was written during the McCarthy era when communists and homosexuals were being routed out and destroyed by finger pointing. The play was a direct metaphor to help people see what was going on. It is scary that in our modern society we look back on the Salem witch trials as being a ridiculous thing that could never happen again - but only a few decades ago it DID happen. Did we not learn? Could it happen just as easily again in the future, given the right circumstances?The acting in the movie is brilliant. Joan Allen, playing John's wife, got an Oscar nomination for her fine work. Even the smallest bits of dialogue are imbued with meaning. You really get a sense of the layers behind these people.  You begin to understand how they live in a very rigid society, how they chafe at the rules, how they struggle to find meaning in what they do. Every person here has a valid motivation - and has human failings.I found the scenery to be gorgeous. I love colonial times and outfits. The people really seemed to ""be comfortable"" in their wear, and there was a nice variety. You could imagine the elderly woman sitting and sewing her hat, adding on the lace to make it pretty. I do admit that I was struck with how *large* some of the houses were. I don't think they had giant houses like that back then :) It might be a small thing, but it kept seeming ""wrong"" as I watched the movie, sort of like watching a movie about medieval crusaders and having them check their watches.Still, in general that is a minor complaint about a movie which is just beautiful to watch and get sucked into. I really feel this is a very valuable movie for everybody to see and understand and think about. We've already had this situation happen at least twice in the past few hundred years. We need to make sure it doesn't happen again.",5,"Beautiful Acting, Beautiful Dialogue, Beautiful Scenery",1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,2811,"['Sometimes', 'get', 'perfect', 'combination', 'great', 'acting', 'great', 'dialogue', 'great', 'plot', 'great', 'environment', 'really', 'feel', 'Cruicible', 'manages', 'get', 'components', 'right', 'form', 'incredible', 'movie', 'gains', 'value', 'rewatching.First', 'plot', 'Daniel', 'John', 'Proctor', 'man', '1600s', 'Salem', 'Massachusetts', 'who', 'been', 'unfaithful', 'wife', 'slept', 'teen', 'girl', 'Abigail', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'affair', 'things', 'are', 'still', 'not', 'good', 'John', 'home', 'Abigail', 'still', 'John', 'So', 'when', 'group', 'girls', 'go', 'out', 'dance', 'woods', 'cast', 'love', 'potions', 'Abigail', 'John', 'wife', 'die.The', 'girls', 'are', 'caught', 'minister', 'accusations', 'witchcraft', 'begin', 'surface', 'divert', 'suspicion', 'teen', 'girls', 'begin', 'accuse', 'other', 'women', 'neighborhood', 'being', 'witches', 'full', 'blown', 'witch', 'hunt', 'many', 'women', 'are', 'killed', 'based', 'solely', 'accusations', 'group', 'teens', 'sadly', 'very', 'true.The', 'play', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'was', 'written', 'McCarthy', 'era', 'when', 'communists', 'homosexuals', 'were', 'being', 'routed', 'out', 'destroyed', 'finger', 'pointing', 'play', 'was', 'direct', 'metaphor', 'help', 'people', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'scary', 'modern', 'society', 'look', 'back', 'Salem', 'witch', 'trials', 'being', 'ridiculous', 'thing', 'could', 'never', 'happen', 'again', 'only', 'few', 'decades', 'DID', 'happen', 'Did', 'not', 'learn', 'Could', 'happen', 'just', 'easily', 'again', 'future', 'given', 'right', 'circumstances', 'acting', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'playing', 'John', 'wife', 'got', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'fine', 'work', 'Even', 'smallest', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'are', 'imbued', 'meaning', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'layers', 'people', 'begin', 'understand', 'how', 'live', 'very', 'rigid', 'society', 'how', 'chafe', 'rules', 'how', 'struggle', 'find', 'meaning', 'what', 'do', 'Every', 'person', 'here', 'valid', 'motivation', 'human', 'failings.I', 'found', 'scenery', 'be', 'gorgeous', 'love', 'colonial', 'times', 'outfits', 'people', 'really', 'seemed', 'be', 'comfortable', 'wear', 'there', 'was', 'nice', 'variety', 'could', 'imagine', 'elderly', 'woman', 'sitting', 'sewing', 'hat', 'adding', 'lace', 'make', 'pretty', 'do', 'was', 'struck', 'how', '*large*', 'houses', 'were', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'had', 'giant', 'houses', 'back', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'small', 'thing', 'kept', 'seeming', 'wrong', 'watched', 'movie', 'sort', 'watching', 'movie', 'medieval', 'crusaders', 'having', 'check', 'watches.Still', 'general', 'minor', 'complaint', 'movie', 'just', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'get', 'sucked', 'really', 'feel', 'very', 'valuable', 'movie', 'everybody', 'see', 'understand', 'think', 'about', ""'ve"", 'already', 'had', 'situation', 'happen', 'least', 'twice', 'past', 'few', 'hundred', 'years', 'need', 'make', 'sure', ""n't"", 'happen', 'again']",N/A

159646,A319KYEIAZ3SON,079394144X,Mary Whipple,"[40, 66]","Although the playwright Arthur Miller was also the screenwriter for this production starring Winona Ryder and Daniel Day-Lewis, the film bears little resemblance to the play in tone and impact.  Director Nicholas Hytner has abandoned the intimate, almost claustrophobic atmosphere of the dark, interior scenes in the play, in favor of an expansive setting, with many scenes set outside, including panoramic shots of Salem in 1692, full of costumed &quot;citizens.&quot;  The expanded setting makes the psychology and motivation of the witchcraft hysteria more difficult to determine, since the intensity of the settlers' repressed, interior lives is not obvious.  The explanatory notes which Miller incorporates into the play about land disputes, religious controversies, and personal animosities, which led to specific individuals being accused and arrested for witchcraft, are seen only peripherally.As a result, we see Winona Ryder, as Abigail Williams, and her coterie of bewitched girls, screaming hysterically and accusing innocent women of witchcraft without the background which would make these accusations plausible.  Her previous relationship with John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis), in the absence of other motivations, seems to be the primary reason for her behavior, but this thwarted love does not explain the extent of her rage and, especially, the involvement of the other girls.  Day-Lewis is reduced to the role of victim, and one of the hallmarks of his acting, his subtlety, is absent here, except in a wonderful final scene with his wife, played by Joan Allen. Details of the scenery also ring false--houses in this period were very small because of the difficulty of heating, one third the size they are here, and the church/meeting houses were modest in accordance with religious restrictions against unnecessary display.This is a Hollywood version of the witchcraft trials, capitalizing on the sensational at the expense of the complex and subtle forces behind the accusations of witchcraft--the Indian wars which were just ending, the growing independence of individuals, the increasing resentment of hard-line theocratic rule, the abolition of traditional property laws, and most importantly, the lack of any societal role whatsoever for young women, who were not old enough to assume a woman's role and who, bored and left out of decision-making, were on their own in dealing with their adult feelings.

In my opinion, it was one of the finest films of that decade.Arthur Miller originally wrote his play, THE CRUCIBLE, to serve as an analogy for the House Unamerican Activities witchhunt that was then going on in this country.  People may not have been condemned to hang back then, but lives and careers were being destroyed, often on the whims of the investigators and witnesses.The setting for the play and the film, adapted for the screen by Miller, is 17th century Salem, Massachusetts, where 19 people were actually hanged because they would not confess to being in league with the Devil.A group of teenage girls, led by Winona Ryder, meets in the woods at midnight for a secret love-conjuring ceremony, but instead of love, Ryder wishes for the death of her former lover's (Daniel Day-Lewis) wife (Joan Allen).  When the ritual is witnessed by the corrupt town minister (Bruce Davison), the girls are accused of witchcraft.To save themselves from being whipped, Ryder devises a plan that ultimately causes many members of the community, accused of consorting with Satan, to stand trail before judge Paul Scofield.Before this tribunal, proof is not necessary...merely an accusation by Ryder and her girls or any citizen, whatever their ulterior motives.When Allen is accused by Ryder, Day-Lewis takes on the court in an attempt to prove his former lover a fraud.This is a disturbing, frightening motion picture, mainly because this did happen and it can happen again.Nicholas Hytner directed.

Yes, filming an influential literary classic can be a problematic task. But ultimately, director Hytner does an excellent job with a truly marvelous cast.&quot;The Crucible&quot; is based on a real historical incident: the Salem witchcraft trials, which resulted in the execution of 19 individuals in late 17th century New England. Miller's play and screenplay could also be read as a metaphor for the anti-Communist &quot;witch hunt&quot; led by United States Senator Joseph McCarthy in the mid-20th century (a crisis which Miller lived through).The film is a chilling exploration of religious fanaticism, paranoia, scapegoating, mass hysteria, and sexual guilt. Winona Ryder turns in a disturbingly effective performance as the young woman who is the flashpoint of the crisis. Daniel Day-Lewis and the luminous Joan Allen are superb as a married couple who become entangled in the trials. And a special mention should be made of Bruce Davison, who is both loathsome and pitiable as the minister who plays a key role in the trials. Davison's excellent performance eerily foreshadows his role as the mutant-hating senator in the film &quot;X-Men.&quot; Good costuming and set design add to the overall effectiveness of the film.Ultimately, I see &quot;The Crucible&quot; as, in part, a cautionary tale of the danger of allowing religious dogma to dictate public policy.

Hatred, fear, jealousy, hypocrisy, religious mania, attention-seeking, conviction, strength, determination, repentance, and a host of other emotions and character traits are vividly brought to life by a superb cast:  Daniel Day-Lewis is a great John Proctor (nobody else could have done better), Winona Ryder is very good as the conniving and bitter Abigail Williams, Joan Allen was nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of Elizabeth Proctor, and Paul Scofield should have won an Oscar for his cold-hearted portrayal of Justice Danforth.  The conflict between Proctor and Danforth is what sustains the play's momentum for the second and third acts (about the last hour and fifteen minutes of the movie), and Lewis and Scofield bring that epic conflict to life:  the classic good v. evil, with the sides getting somewhat mixed up as to who is who. . . .  Lewis plays the flawed hero to Scofield's self-righteous and vindictive villain with palpable energy.  How Scofield's performance was overlooked by the Academy is just another example of their oblivion.  He gives me the willies with his methodical, calculating delivery of Miller's chilling dialogue:  ""Who weeps for these weeps for corruption"" (among a bunch of great lines from the play/movie).This isn't simply a play enacted in front of movie cameras (like Death of a Salesman).  The director uses his camera very effectively, capturing some great close-up moments, unique perspectives and camera angles, and bringing a sense of ""bigness"" to the whole story.  The play can seem very isolated, with its sparse sets and black-and-white costumes.  Miller also expands the movie to begin well before the play does (giving the movie-goer information that he must have assumed the play-reader would already have) and extending it beyond the conviction of Proctor to include his execution, along with that of Rebecca Nurse and Martha Corey.  Just as a side note, each of those three was hanged in a separate group in the original trials--great symbolism from Miller, including each larger original group of victims in the final trio.  Also great symbolism in Proctor's Christ-like physical placement in the middle of the two ""sinners,"" as he takes their sins upon him--the crucifixion is represented very effectively.Bottom line:  You won't see a better adaptation of a play to movie anytime soon.  Nothing essential is left out, and some nice details are brought in to give the movie a distinction from its original source, the play.  If you can make it through this play and not be outraged by the injustice and hypocrisy, then you have a heart as cold as Danforth's.  What Miller would likely want you to do is apply that outrage to similar situations that go on every day, just as he intended with his original play (the McCarthy hearings, the ""Red"" Scare).

This film shows how wrong I was and how much deeper and more broadly applicable The Crucible is as a work of literature.  Like Ibsen's Enemy of the People, it asks how does a person possessed of the truth respond to a society overcome by illusion or superstition?  Indeed, Miller's question is more pertinent today than it was in the 50's when, in reality, there was a real ideological war in progress and some prospect of a live one.  What may or should one risk to challenge the orthodoxies of political correctness, unquestioned egalitarianism and mass culture?  Viewed in this light, Miller's work is a profound one of lasting impact.  More pertinently for this review, the 1996 film highlights all of this because it is so well directed and so well acted.  Day Lewis, as the central player, excels as always, but it is almost a shame that he has such a superlative supporting cast:  Winona Ryder, Joan Allen, Jeffrey Jones, Paul Schofield and Bruce Davison, all of whom are flawless in their roles.  With such talented work some of the excellence has to be overlooked in light of the others.

159668,AZCDCO6KK2T81,079394144X,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[28, 34]","If you can watch this film and not go through every emotion you own, then you need to check yourself for a pulse.Of course, I'm being a bit silly with my opening to this review, but the reality is that this is a film that will touch you on every imaginable level if you can get past the era in which the story takes place and the hysteria of that time period.  Rehashing the plot is a waste at this point as almost every student in America has read this play in their 11th grade English class, but this story is as relevant today as the day it was written and the time in which the story takes place.Arthur Miller wrote this story as an indictment against McCarthism and although that time has past we still have similar witch hunts today and, sadly, always will.  1970's had us pointing fingers, thanks to Anita Bryant, anyone we thought might be a closet homosexual.  The 1980's had us pointing fingers at anyone who had more wealth than we did (much like in ""The Crucible"").  The 1990's had us pointing fingers at family members based on so-called ""recovered memories"" of sexual abuse (later proven to psychological hogwash, but a clever way to get back at and smear the name of a family member we didn't like).  And this century has us pointing fingers at anyone Middle Eastern as a terrorist.  I recall immediately after 9/11 our leading law enforcement official, John Ashcroft, going on national television and warning us to be on the look out for ""those that don't belong.""  To me, that was government sanctioned racism at its worst.  I was hurt by 9/11, but I was hurt even more by that reaction to it.  This cuts to the heart of Miller's story wherein anyone can point a finger at anyone and destroy a life, a family, a community for personal gain and that gain can be financial, emotional, political, or whatever.  As long as we have people that are motivated by hate, fear, and power, this story will remain timeless and will never be irrelevant.As far as the performances go,  I can't think of finer acting off the top of my head than those in this film and most especially by Daniel Day-Lewis whose final lines will stir your very soul and Joan Allen who can play some one so cold with such depth of feeling.  Like Lewis, her final scenes are unforgettable.  You simply can't walk away from this film the same person you were before you saw it.  It is truly that moving.  All the supporting cast members are familiar faces and all do an outstanding job, especially Winona Ryder in what is probably the best performance of her young career.her character's obsessive and selfish desire to have the one man she can't sets the ball in motion in this story and she, sadly, has no real regrets.  She is conflicted in knowing that her actions are basically wrong, but that they are still somehow justifiable.  Ryder truly captures the soul, or lack thereof, of this character.  She is extraordinary here.The screenplay is adapted by Miller who wrote the play itself and makes the shift from play to screen seamlessly.  The direction is confident and appropriately claustrophobic.  He allows his actors do their thing without heavy handed influence.  The score is terrific and stirring, and the cinematography has almost a documentary feel to it.Rent or buy this modern masterpiece; it is worthy of your attention.One last note.  So many know this story, but, surprisingly, few seem to adequately understand it's title.  I thought the below might be helpful:The American Heritage Dictionary defines ""crucible"" as:1.

First off it is remarkable that such a classic play actually has a screenplay written by the original playwright.  Unfortunately the film does seem more confusing than the play as the reasons some of the early victims are targeted are not made as clear in the film as the stage version.  The acting is top notch by Daniel Day Lewis as John Proctor (though I wish they hadn't felt it was necessary to show him with his shirt unbuttoned so often).

There was a time in history where unsubstantiated things that ranges from witchcraft to divine superiority were never questioned and generally taken as facts. Even though ""The Crucible"" can be interpreted in a number of ways (Arthur Miller wrote this during the Mccarthy communist hunt), the movie allows us to see what happens when reason is superceded by passion.The movie opens with a group of teenage girls participating in ""devil's work"" which was cut short by the discovery of a shocked Reverend. In order to escape the consequences of their actions, the girls masterminded by Abby (Winona Ryder) concocted a series of lies implicating a number of innocent men and women involving them in witchcraft. One of those accused is Goody Proctor (Joan Allen), who was targeted primarily by Abby so that she can finally be with the man she was in love with, Goody's husband John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis) Of course the consequences of those events weren't confined in the lives of the major characters but actually affected the whole town as a witch hunt hysteria erupted.Daniel Day Lewis gave a towering performance that further strengthens the fact that he is one of the best living actors today. It's an indelible performance that stays with you long after the movie is through. Winona Ryder also gave an ace performance. You have to admire the roles she chooses (at least at the peak of her career) because it is evident that she wanted to be taken seriously as an actress. Other actresses of her stature would probably gone way different career path that choose box office prospect over challenging roles. Joan Allen was equally impressive. Just by standing still and emoting with her eyes and face, she was able to say a lot of things. And she did that without the help of a ""big scene"" that both Day Lewis and Ryder had.Personally, my only minor criticism in the movie is that we weren't given enough insights to why the girls subscribe to Abby's (we know her motivation for doing it) lies. A scene explaining the girl's unity in their lie would at least let the viewers understand their motivations for doing so. It was disturbing to see towards the end of the movie where the girls were rejoicing and all happy when those they accused were being publicly hanged, no sign of remorse or shame.This movie really affected me and I consider this to be one of my favorite movies.

159673,A20TJ5P97W5MS1,079394144X,The Inquisitor,"[2, 2]","Why is it important to think for yourself?The Crucible, a 1953 play by the American playwright Arthur Miller, attempts to answer that very important question.This 1996 film version, which was  written by Arthur Miller and based on his play of the same name, does a good job of bringing the content to life.When viewing this film I think it is important to keep a completely open mind.  This is an extremely well written story with an equally important purpose.At some point in your academic career you probably studied Arthur Miller's play from the 1950s. You might even be doing that right now and considering an attempt to grasp Miller's concepts through a more accessible format such as film.  Overall the Crucible is about the vengeful spirits of humanity. Is this vengeful spirit something actually evil or is it the inherent danger that lies in the ever existent human element known as group think?  The whole Crucible presentation is very clever. Miller essentially used the setting of the Salam Witch Trials as the backdrop to let people know how he felt about  McCarthyism, when the U.S. government blacklisted accused communists.The Salem Witch trials took place in the Province of Massachusetts Bay during 1692 and 1693.  In the Crucible a group of women in a small town are accused of practicing witchcraft. In an effort to appear innocent the women deny the accusations. In turn they blame their unlawful activity on fellow townspeople that are in turn brought to court and put on the stand for practicing witchcraft.  A wave of hysteria engulfs the town, and the powers that be use the girls accusations to instigate a series of trials, during which totally innocent people are accused of heresy and executed.  Arthur Miller directly connected this unfortunate event to 1950s McCarthyism.Throughout the 1940s and 1950s America was overwhelmed with concerns about the threat of communism.  McCarthy capitalized on this fear and created an atmosphere of hysteria & paranoia through accusing many people of being communist. Anyone that would stand against McCarthy would also be accused of of being anti-American.The Crucible stands as a excellent allegory and a powerful statement that it is always important to avoid group think in times of hysteria. Looking back now, we think the witch trials & McCarthyism were acts of pure craziness. The most important question to always ask is: what will they think a hundred years from now?",5,The Empire 5 Star 500 - #130,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,2443,"['Why', 'important', 'think', 'Crucible', '1953', 'play', 'American', 'playwright', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'answer', 'very', 'important', 'question.This', '1996', 'film', 'version', 'was', 'written', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'based', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'content', 'life.When', 'viewing', 'film', 'think', 'important', 'keep', 'completely', 'open', 'mind', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'story', 'equally', 'important', 'purpose.At', 'point', 'academic', 'career', 'probably', 'studied', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'play', '1950s', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'doing', 'right', 'now', 'considering', 'attempt', 'grasp', 'Miller', 'concepts', 'more', 'accessible', 'format', 'such', 'film', 'Crucible', 'vengeful', 'spirits', 'humanity', 'vengeful', 'spirit', 'something', 'actually', 'evil', 'inherent', 'danger', 'ever', 'existent', 'human', 'element', 'known', 'group', 'think', 'whole', 'Crucible', 'presentation', 'very', 'clever', 'Miller', 'essentially', 'used', 'setting', 'Salam', 'Witch', 'Trials', 'backdrop', 'let', 'people', 'know', 'how', 'felt', 'McCarthyism', 'when', 'U.S.', 'government', 'blacklisted', 'accused', 'communists.The', 'Salem', 'Witch', 'trials', 'took', 'place', 'Province', 'Massachusetts', 'Bay', '1692', '1693', 'Crucible', 'group', 'women', 'small', 'town', 'are', 'accused', 'practicing', 'witchcraft', 'effort', 'appear', 'innocent', 'women', 'deny', 'accusations', 'turn', 'blame', 'unlawful', 'activity', 'fellow', 'townspeople', 'are', 'turn', 'brought', 'court', 'put', 'stand', 'practicing', 'witchcraft', 'wave', 'hysteria', 'engulfs', 'town', 'powers', 'be', 'girls', 'accusations', 'instigate', 'series', 'trials', 'totally', 'innocent', 'people', 'are', 'accused', 'heresy', 'executed', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'directly', 'connected', 'unfortunate', 'event', '1950s', 'McCarthyism.Throughout', '1940s', '1950s', 'America', 'was', 'overwhelmed', 'concerns', 'threat', 'communism', 'McCarthy', 'capitalized', 'fear', 'created', 'atmosphere', 'hysteria', 'paranoia', 'accusing', 'many', 'people', 'being', 'communist', 'Anyone', 'would', 'stand', 'McCarthy', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'accused', 'being', 'anti-American.The', 'Crucible', 'stands', 'excellent', 'allegory', 'powerful', 'statement', 'always', 'important', 'avoid', 'group', 'think', 'times', 'hysteria', 'Looking', 'back', 'now', 'think', 'witch', 'trials', 'McCarthyism', 'were', 'acts', 'pure', 'craziness', 'most', 'important', 'question', 'always', 'ask', 'what', 'will', 'think', 'hundred', 'years', 'now']",N/A
159674,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,079394144X,Tim Janson,"[7, 7]","The Crucible, based on Arthur Miller's play, is an entertaining, if not always accurate version of the events in 1692 Salem Village.  Having read numerous books on the subject I still cannot say with any certainty what led to the events that so many men and women were accused of witchcraft and so many young girls seemed to be afflicted.  One can question why it was only Salem's females, and not males that seemed afflicted with screams, catatonic states, hallucinations, etc...At any rate, one conclusion that I could not draw was that of a woman scorned, in this case Abigail Williams played by Winona Ryder whose advances are refused by the married John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis).  The Proctors are also a good deal younger in the film than they were in real life.  John was sixty when he was hung.  Elizabeth would have been in her mid 40's at the time of the trials.  Pregnancy saved her from the hangman's noose.The film does maintain a fair dose of accuracy in its treatment of the slave Tituba and her part in the whole affair as well as the accusations against some of the towns ""trouble makers"" such as goody Nurse and Giles Corey who was pressed to death for refusing to testify.  The courtroom scenes were the most dynamic and exciting, and called to mind those period paintings from old books depicting the trials with stern, puritanical judges pointing accusing fingers.  The film also did a good job of capturing that stifling, repressive 17th century setting and the costuming was first rate.The best performances for me came from those men portraying the various ministers and judges, particularly Bruce Davison as Reverend Parris and Paul Scofield as Judge Danforth.  While not an entirely accurate film it still does a good job at capturing one of the seminal events in early American history.Reviewed by Tim Janson",4,ENTERTAINING IF NOT ENTIRELY ACCURATE,1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,1837,"['Crucible', 'based', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'play', 'entertaining', 'not', 'always', 'accurate', 'version', 'events', '1692', 'Salem', 'Village', 'Having', 'read', 'numerous', 'books', 'subject', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'certainty', 'what', 'led', 'events', 'so', 'many', 'men', 'women', 'were', 'accused', 'witchcraft', 'so', 'many', 'young', 'girls', 'seemed', 'be', 'afflicted', 'One', 'can', 'question', 'why', 'was', 'only', 'Salem', 'females', 'not', 'males', 'seemed', 'afflicted', 'screams', 'catatonic', 'states', 'hallucinations', 'etc', 'rate', 'one', 'conclusion', 'could', 'not', 'draw', 'was', 'woman', 'scorned', 'case', 'Abigail', 'Williams', 'played', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'advances', 'are', 'refused', 'married', 'John', 'Proctor', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Proctors', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'deal', 'younger', 'film', 'were', 'real', 'life', 'John', 'was', 'sixty', 'when', 'was', 'hung', 'Elizabeth', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'mid', '40', 'time', 'trials', 'Pregnancy', 'saved', 'hangman', 'noose.The', 'film', 'maintain', 'fair', 'dose', 'accuracy', 'treatment', 'slave', 'Tituba', 'part', 'whole', 'affair', 'as', 'well', 'accusations', 'towns', 'trouble', 'makers', 'such', 'goody', 'Nurse', 'Giles', 'Corey', 'who', 'was', 'pressed', 'death', 'refusing', 'testify', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'were', 'most', 'dynamic', 'exciting', 'called', 'mind', 'period', 'paintings', 'old', 'books', 'depicting', 'trials', 'stern', 'puritanical', 'judges', 'pointing', 'accusing', 'fingers', 'film', 'also', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'stifling', 'repressive', '17th', 'century', 'setting', 'costuming', 'was', 'first', 'rate.The', 'best', 'performances', 'came', 'men', 'portraying', 'various', 'ministers', 'judges', 'particularly', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'Reverend', 'Parris', 'Paul', 'Scofield', 'Judge', 'Danforth', 'not', 'entirely', 'accurate', 'film', 'still', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'one', 'seminal', 'events', 'early', 'American', 'history.Reviewed', 'Tim', 'Janson']",N/A

159677,A18C1PCR8WUAST,079394144X,"Tracy Hodson ""Awi Usdi""","[15, 19]","This film, an historically inaccurate adaptation of a brilliant but historically inaccurate play by Arthur Miller that sought to find the emotional, rather than the historical center of the ""crucible"" that was Salem Village in 1692, is brought to life primarily through the vivid performances of Daniel Day-Lewis, Joan Allen, and in a rare excellent performance, Winona Ryder. I lost two of my Great-great-great, etc... Aunts in this bizarre episode of American History, one of whom, Rebecca Towne Nourse, is a main character in the play, while the second and third Towne women to be cried out against, Mary Towne Eastey and Sarah Towne Bridges-Cloyce, were not mentioned in Mr. Miller's play, but did actually play parts in the real events, which do not really resemble the play at all. In real life, the girls were quite young, 11 or younger, and as Abigail was only 11, there was no sexual relationship involved between her and anyone. Mr. Miller used sex to represent repression and so aged the girls and gave them back-stories that suited his purposes in order to find, as already stated, the emotional truth of the situation, rather than the literal truth. He was also writing during the House Un-american Activities trials, and used this piece of history to illustrate the perversion of justice that can occur when no one is watching and absolute power is handed over to corrupt people. In Salem Village (not Salem proper), the court was taken over by the church, ""spectral"" evidence was used against the orders of the Magistrate in charge of the jurisdiction (he was away in England for a while, and when he returned, 19 people had been hanged, and as more than 400 had been accused and imprisoned all over the place, three others had died of conditions; he shut down the trials immediately), and as those who were accused were stripped of their property which was then given to the accusers, it wasn't long before personal feuds became the reason behind most of the accusations. In this tiny village, a few hysterical girls led on by their hysterical parents and then fevered church leaders, were able to gain incredible power for a few months until afterwards, it was as though the whole thing had been a dream.The film takes the action out of the stifling courtroom and tiny, small-windowed rooms of 18th century New England homes, and opens it up to the realities of trying to subsist on the hard Massachusetts soil in weather that the settlers had never seen in England. Misery, poverty, 4-6 hour-long sermons, constant vigilance by the church elders, and the exhaustion that came with the refusal to allow relief with song or dance or any other sort of joyous act--even the refusal to allow color in clothing--led to an oppression of spirit that was felt down to the youngest memebers of the village. Into that cauldron was added the exotic ingredient of the Carribean slave, Tituba, who did indeed take the young girls out to dance around the fire in the night, teaching them her own religion from Haiti (which we now call Voodun), and in this small piece of freedom a few girls found release. But when caught, Tituba's threats should the girls give her away were believed and in order to escape punishment, they did things such as suddenly faint away, cry out in gibberish, and do anything else they could think of to avoid being questioned by their parents, and as doctors could find nothing wrong with then, the Church elders were brought in and so began the search into ""witchcraft,"" a notion the church fathers had brought with them from England and Europe and though the ""burning times"" had passed there, the concepts were revived and used to explain the fainting and rambling the little girls put on to avoid whipping. Only after they got more attention than they expected did things get out of hand, and only then were the powerful brought in to genuinely take over the town.I found the film to be a good adaptation of a play that is very intense and filled with layers of meaning above and beyond the actual events of 1692. To see the hard and unforgiving land is helpful in understanding the psyches of those who fought it (for unlike the Iriquois who did not fight, but rather lived in harmony with, the environment and therefore had plenty of food and shelter and still, at that time, a relatively peaceful existence); to see even that one quality of disharmony with one's surroundings helps to understand how so much unease would fill the village. With the girls older and the one, Abigail, having had both a sexual and more open-minded relationship with a free-thinking man (Day-Lewis) who was already living in mild opposition with the rest of the villagers, more fuel is added to the smoldering fire. As we watch Ryder's passion turn to rage (in the scene where she tries to once again get her former lover to take her back, Ryder's performance is especially ferocious and affecting) we see the beginnings of what we know then will soon become a nightmare of personal vengeance that spreads from Abigail to all the villagers, each of whom has his or her own ax to grind. When one is starving and can get one's neighbor's swine simply by crying out that the neighbor has fixed one with a furious, devilish stare that has caused a fearful pain in the back and head, it becomes frighteningly easy to ward off hunger. In the film, we see the calculations of many of the villagers as well as the elders, and one is left with the question: what would I have done with hungry children, after a hard winter and another on its way?As I wrote in the heading, it's the performances that drive the film more than the text; Joan Allen is especially heart-breaking as the quiet, sedate, repressed and rather simple Elizabeth Proctor who simply does not understand her husband's mind or his passions (intellectual as well as physical) and is unable to meet them so that they can have a happy marriage. Day-Lewis does a good job of conveying this intelligent and harried man's frustration with the narrowness of his life and his inability to tolerate the situation in which he finds himself. While having resigned himself to farming as best he can in the rocky soil, his thirst for intellectual stimulation is palpable, and while it's easy to write Abigail off as a mere sexual diversion, Ryder gives her enough substance that we do know she had also provided Proctor with the intellectual stimulation he so desperately craves, and that this is why his wife is so threatened by her--a mere bodily diversion would have been more easily borne than being faced daily with the knowledge that a girl of Abigail's intelligence as well as passionate nature would have made Proctor a better wife.  This is probably the only film in which I found Winona Ryder to be a real force, and while it is the material that gives her this opportunity, she makes the most of it. When she threatens the other girls, she is frightening, and with Proctor, is able to go from seductive to vindictive in a heartbeat. It is easy to see why Elizabeth Proctor found her so much more powerful than herself, despite the fact that Abigail was in her house ostensibly as a servant.The costumes and set design are accurate and beautiful in their stark simplicity, and the rugged coastline of New England is certainly seen in its most harsh and unforgiving beauty. The Arran Islands off the West Coast of Ireland look like this now, in the 21st century, and life is only marginally easier there now than it was here then. All in all, events came together in that challenging time and place to form the perfect crucible for horror, and I feel that the film does a pretty good job of capturing much of that. It cannot help but lack the locked-down intensity of a stage production, but it is a creditable effort for this medium.It would have been nice if the filmmakers had bothered to get some dates correct; Rebecca and John did not die together, for instance, though they do in the film. John Proctor was hanged on 19th August, and Rebecca Towne Nourse on 19th July (she was 71 and the most respected woman in Salem Village; once she went, many lost hope). Her sister, Mary, was hanged on the 22nd September, after which the Towne men gave up on such concepts of justice and truth, and rescued the third Towne sister, Sarah, imprisoned in a shed; she was broken out of it by her brothers, and taken back to the family home in Topsfield, out of the jurisdiction of the Court. She later sued the Magistrates, and was awarded 3 gold sovreigns (a film, ""Three Sovreigns for Sarah,"" was made about her, with Vanessa Redgrave in the title role).  One sovreign for each sister...I guess I've written more history than an actual review, but as more and more people are getting their ""history"" from films and television, it doesn't hurt to relate in some detail what actually went on in the events that inspired a play, and then film. Especially when one's own family was involved. All but two of William Towne and Joanna Blessing's 8 children had been born in England, and I rather doubt they expected to lose any of them in this manner when they came to Massachusetts Colony in the 1630's. It was a brief but terrible chapter of early American history, and has since served as a fascinating event for hundreds of psychologists and theologians, primarily because it was unique, unlike the generations-long, multiple-nation Inquisitions in Europe. It's impossible to ever fully understand ""Why then?"" ""Why there?"" We watch this film, the play, read books, the letters written by Mary Towne Eastey and others, and still we ask, ""Why?""",3,It's the performances that make it work,1110844800,"03 15,

159678,A220FJEQNGMSRN,079394144X,Trevor Willsmer,"[5, 6]","The Crucible is considerably simplified from the play. Despite Arthur Miller handling the adaptation himself, so much of the historical detail and motivation for the witchhunts is dropped to get the narrative moving faster that at the end of the day the whole thing seems to have been reduced to a simple case of a woman spurned and a bad case of mass hysteria. Some awkward performances in the first half don't help either - Bruce Davison is shrilly ineffective, Daniel Day Lewis still seems to be doing Hawkeye, Joan Allen does her serious face again and the jury's still out on whether Winona Ryder is giving a convincing performance as an unconvincing liar or and unconvincing performance as a convincing liar. Yet the strength of the material shines through and suddenly, by the halfway point, you suddenly realise that you are completely gripped by it and that most of the performances have improved immeasurably once Paul Scofield has arrived to up the ante. Indeed, by the end the piece is genuinely tragic and moving (that said, I still maintain that the real hero of the piece is not John Proctor but Pastor Hale - the only character to realise his terrible error and to have the courage to publicly try to remedy it, however hopelessly). Excellent supporting performances from Karron Graves and, surprisingly, George Gaynes, although the houses seem a little too large for Puritan stock. Definitely a film of two halves, but worth seeing for the sheer power of the latter half.The extras aren't plentiful but are decent enough - commentary by Hytner and Miller, brief featurette and an equally brief interview between Lewis and Miller.",4,"Not the definitive version, but ultimately moving and powerful",1150588800,"06 18, 2006",2006,1646,"['Crucible', 'considerably', 'simplified', 'play', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'handling', 'adaptation', 'so', 'much', 'historical', 'detail', 'motivation', 'witchhunts', 'dropped', 'get', 'narrative', 'moving', 'faster', 'end', 'day', 'whole', 'thing', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'simple', 'case', 'woman', 'spurned', 'bad', 'case', 'mass', 'hysteria', 'awkward', 'performances', 'first', 'half', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'shrilly', 'ineffective', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'still', 'be', 'doing', 'Hawkeye', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'serious', 'face', 'again', 'jury', 'still', 'out', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'giving', 'convincing', 'performance', 'unconvincing', 'liar', 'unconvincing', 'performance', 'convincing', 'liar', 'strength', 'material', 'shines', 'suddenly', 'halfway', 'point', 'suddenly', 'realise', 'are', 'completely', 'gripped', 'most', 'performances', 'have', 'improved', 'immeasurably', 'once', 'Paul', 'Scofield', 'arrived', 'ante', 'Indeed', 'end', 'piece', 'genuinely', 'tragic', 'moving', 'said', 'still', 'maintain', 'real', 'hero', 'piece', 'not', 'John', 'Proctor', 'Pastor', 'Hale', 'only', 'character', 'realise', 'terrible', 'error', 'have', 'courage', 'publicly', 'try', 'remedy', 'however', 'hopelessly', 'Excellent', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Karron', 'Graves', 'surprisingly', 'George', 'Gaynes', 'houses', 'seem', 'little', 'too', 'large', 'Puritan', 'stock', 'Definitely', 'film', 'two', 'halves', 'worth', 'seeing', 'sheer', 'power', 'latter', 'half.The', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'plentiful', 'are', 'decent', 'enough', 'commentary', 'Hytner', 'Miller', 'brief', 'featurette', 'equally', 'brief', 'interview', 'Lewis', 'Miller']",N/A

159680,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,079394144X,Wuchak,"[2, 2]","The Salem witch trials that occurred from February 1692 to May 1693 resulted in 19 people hung, another slowly crushed to death and over 150 imprisoned. Historian George Lincoln Burr described it as a notorious case of mass hysteria and vivid cautionary tale about the dangers of isolationism, religious extremism, false accusations and lapses in due process.Since I love history and am a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis you would think that I'd love 1996' ""The Crucible."" But over the years I've seen a couple of clips from it and the film turned me off for some reason. It just struck me as over-the-top. Yes, I realize that filmmakers always have to amp up the dramatics because they only have two hours to tell their story, but I mean over-the-top melodrama in the sense of ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" (1994). If you liked the way that film was done you'll probably love this one.Anyway, I finally decided to actually view ""The Crucible"" and give it the chance it deserves. It does have a lot going for it -- quality actors, authentic sets, costumes and locations (shot in Massachusetts and Nova Scotia) and a dialogue-driven approach. Unfortunately, the film's very first scene struck me as inauthentic. It shows several young girls escaping into the forest in the middle of the night to dance under the moonlight (one nude) and cast spells, led by a black woman from the village. This scene was ten times wilder than anything at Woodstock and yet we're to believe all these young Puritan girls felt liberated enough to do this in 1692? Right. I realize that something like this supposedly happened but it's just so amped-up in the movie that it strikes an unbelievable chord.I dismissed it, however, and continued to give the movie a chance, but the story and dialogue just failed to draw me into the dramatics.I think it's worth watching for the reasons cited above and the fact that it does give you a picture of what it was like back then, overdone as it is, and it does inspire you to research the events. Other than these factors, though, the movie fails, particularly with its hyper-melodramatic approach.GRADE: C+",3,Over-the-top melodrama,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,2120,"['Salem', 'witch', 'trials', 'occurred', 'February', '1692', 'May', '1693', 'resulted', '19', 'people', 'hung', 'slowly', 'crushed', 'death', '150', 'imprisoned', 'Historian', 'George', 'Lincoln', 'Burr', 'described', 'notorious', 'case', 'mass', 'hysteria', 'vivid', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'dangers', 'isolationism', 'religious', 'extremism', 'false', 'accusations', 'lapses', 'due', 'process.Since', 'love', 'history', 'am', 'fan', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'would', 'think', ""'d"", 'love', '1996', 'Crucible', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'couple', 'clips', 'film', 'turned', 'off', 'reason', 'just', 'struck', 'over-the-top', 'Yes', 'realize', 'filmmakers', 'always', 'have', 'amp', 'up', 'dramatics', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'hours', 'tell', 'story', 'mean', 'over-the-top', 'melodrama', 'sense', 'Mary', 'Shelley', 'Frankenstein', '1994', 'liked', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'done', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'one.Anyway', 'finally', 'decided', 'actually', 'view', 'Crucible', 'give', 'chance', 'have', 'lot', 'going', 'quality', 'actors', 'authentic', 'sets', 'costumes', 'locations', 'shot', 'Massachusetts', 'Nova', 'Scotia', 'dialogue-driven', 'approach', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'struck', 'inauthentic', 'several', 'young', 'girls', 'escaping', 'forest', 'middle', 'night', 'dance', 'moonlight', 'one', 'nude', 'cast', 'spells', 'led', 'black', 'woman', 'village', 'scene', 'was', 'ten', 'times', 'wilder', 'anything', 'Woodstock', 'yet', ""'re"", 'believe', 'young', 'Puritan', 'girls', 'felt', 'liberated', 'enough', 'do', '1692', 'Right', 'realize', 'something', 'supposedly', 'happened', 'just', 'so', 'amped-up', 'movie', 'unbelievable', 'chord.I', 'dismissed', 'however', 'continued', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'story', 'dialogue', 'just', 'failed', 'draw', 'dramatics.I', 'think', 'worth', 'watching', 'reasons', 'cited', 'fact', 'give', 'picture', 'what', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'inspire', 'research', 'events', 'Other', 'factors', 'though', 'movie', 'particularly', 'hyper-melodramatic', 'approach.GRADE', 'C+']",N/A
