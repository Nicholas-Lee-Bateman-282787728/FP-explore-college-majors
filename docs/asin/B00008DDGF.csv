738206,A1C6YIPDQ96RHV,B00008DDGF,James D. Madden,"[9, 10]","This DVD production of the story of Moses has accomplished exactly what I had hoped for my 3yr old son: an interest in learning about the Lord and His involvement in the lives of those who trust Him.  My son often recites (in surprising detail) various scenes from the tale.  One of my fellow brothers in Christ calls my son ""The Little Preacher"" because my son enjoys capturing the attention of those around him so he can retell the story of Moses.  I understand some reviewing this telling of the story may prefer stricter adherence to various nuances and literary exactness from Scripture - I can appreciate that as I am a literal believer of Scripture.  There is never a perfect retelling of any Biblical story that will appeal to everyone's preference.  As already mentioned, this achieved what I had hoped for my son: help him develop an interest in learning about the Lord and begin building a faith in the Lord.",5,Inspiring Interest in  Future Believers,1191542400,"10 5, 2007",2007,919,"['DVD', 'production', 'story', 'Moses', 'accomplished', 'exactly', 'what', 'had', 'hoped', '3yr', 'old', 'son', 'interest', 'learning', 'Lord', 'involvement', 'lives', 'who', 'trust', 'Him', 'My', 'son', 'often', 'surprising', 'detail', 'various', 'scenes', 'tale', 'One', 'fellow', 'brothers', 'Christ', 'calls', 'son', 'Little', 'Preacher', 'son', 'capturing', 'attention', 'so', 'can', 'retell', 'story', 'Moses', 'understand', 'reviewing', 'telling', 'story', 'may', 'prefer', 'stricter', 'adherence', 'various', 'nuances', 'literary', 'exactness', 'Scripture', 'can', 'appreciate', 'am', 'literal', 'believer', 'Scripture', 'never', 'perfect', 'retelling', 'Biblical', 'story', 'will', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'preference', 'already', 'mentioned', 'achieved', 'what', 'had', 'hoped', 'son', 'help', 'develop', 'interest', 'learning', 'Lord', 'begin', 'building', 'faith', 'Lord']",Greatest Heroes and Legends of the Bible: The Story of Moses
