I just knew that with Lisa gone, (and Meav, and Orla, and Hayley, and Alex, and Lynn et al LOL) it just wasn't going to be any good.  To my amazement, it was fabulous.  In many ways this concert is one of the most dynamic and entertaining of them all.  I know that is saying a mouthful, but there it is.  The girls (although Chloe is not permanent) were just amazing in voice, looks, musicality.  As a musician myself, I am pretty picky on production, pitch control, presentation.  This production is just about perfect.  When I saw that Susan was doing Lisa's stunning ""the Voice"", I again was just sure she could not pull that off, boy was I wrong.  This is Celtic Woman at it's finest.  If I had never heard Celtic Woman before this concert I would be hooked, as it is, I have enjoyed their whole journey since the beginning along with Celtic Thunder.

This one is strictly a low budget or economy approach.  There is no large orchestra, only a small band which does not appear to be led by anyone.  The large chorus has been replaced with only four singers. David Downes appears in only one song.  The blu-ray video presentation is excellent, however, the audio content leaves a lot to be desired.  It is definitely not up to blu-ray quality.

1689367,A1XQP1HXYJCUZP,B00HF95PA4,Dan Coffee,"[55, 59]","When I buy a ticket for a show like Celtic Woman, I get the best seat I can, and when I say ""best seat"" I mean `one where I can watch the performers with as little distraction or visual strain as can be achieved'.  But whether I sit in the first row, or in the balcony I have one and only one reason for buying the ticket. ""I want to see the performers perform!"" The video editors for Celtic Woman have decided that we are missing out on something if we don't get periodic doses of video of the audience, even while the girls are right in the middle of a song. It isn't enough to just pan the audience in between songs; the video editors are convinced that we need a visual confirmation of what the people in the audience are doing ALL THROUGH THE SHOW! Even if we can already hear the audience clapping, that's not good enough; they have to provide visual proof. I know there are those who say `seeing is believing' but for me ... when I hear people clapping I don't need visual proof. And further adding to the imprudence, is the incredible number of times they do it. It wasn't just once or twice (in a limited way) but dozens and dozens of times! I counted 89 times in the main show alone that they did it, and ... some of these shots are more than just a second or two. Probably 70% of the shots were clapping or smiling, but there were others with people singing and even several of a 5 year old girl dancing! What a treat that was! [The camera coverage she got made me wonder if it might be the video editor's daughter.]Now let me reiterate ... when I say clapping, I'm not talking about the applause between song selections; that is absolutely fine. What I'm talking about is people simply clapping and/or singing to the music or even worse ... in some shots they are not doing anything but `just plain staring'. Now by a show of hands ... who among you ... go to a concert to sit and watch the people sitting around you, sing and clap to the music? That's right ... we don't go to watch the audience, we want to see the people on stage.These `garbage shots' of the audience were not as frequently used in this show as the last Christmas show that Celtic Woman did, but for some reason that I can't explain, it was more annoying in this show. Something else that I find confusing is that 3 of the songs were pristine, not contaminated by any of the video adulteration. But then on the other hand ... even the bonus song selections were ruined with the same video junk, so I have no explanation for the songs that were not `doctored'.As for the concert itself ... I need some Prozac to overcome my disappointment. I was all psyched up for a lively new program. Their last tour had so many emotionally depressing songs that I figured it would be impossible for this one not to be far more `positive' and therefore exciting. NO SUCH LUCK! What we got is a trip down memory lane. There is hardly a song in the show that they haven't done before (although it wasn't always the same singers singing them). Additionally, when they were done before, they were done so beautifully that it's crazy to think they could do them as well again. A perfect example of this dilemma is the song Caledonia. When Lisa Kelly sang Caledonia she sang it like she `lived it'! Susan McFadden has an absolutely wonderful voice and she's a real charmer, but it was a mistake to let her sing a song which had already been preformed perfectly (by another Celtic Woman).I'm sure that not everyone agrees with my viewpoint of this show and I respect that. We are all individuals and we all have are own opinions, likes, and dislikes. I can only tell you what my feelings are about the presentation. Unquestionably many of you will TOTALLY disagree with me. But ... hopefully you will respect my honesty. I really expected something new and wonderful, and I didn't get it.Quite honestly, I hope everyone likes the show because these girls are extremely talented, and anything they sing is worth listening to, but `personally' ... I felt cheated because there are other songs that they could have sung just as magnificently. Why did they give us a rerun?[Please feel free to leave comments.]",3,Once again Celtic Woman Ltd has managed to take a silk purse and turn it into a sow's ear.,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,4166,"['When', 'buy', 'ticket', 'show', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'get', 'best', 'seat', 'can', 'when', 'say', 'best', 'seat', 'mean', 'one', 'where', 'can', 'watch', 'performers', 'as', 'little', 'distraction', 'visual', 'strain', 'can', 'be', 'achieved', 'sit', 'first', 'row', 'balcony', 'have', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'reason', 'buying', 'ticket', 'want', 'see', 'performers', 'perform', 'video', 'editors', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'have', 'decided', 'are', 'missing', 'out', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'periodic', 'doses', 'video', 'audience', 'even', 'girls', 'are', 'right', 'middle', 'song', ""n't"", 'enough', 'just', 'pan', 'audience', 'songs', 'video', 'editors', 'are', 'convinced', 'need', 'visual', 'confirmation', 'what', 'people', 'audience', 'are', 'doing', 'ALL', 'THE', 'SHOW', 'Even', 'can', 'already', 'hear', 'audience', 'clapping', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'have', 'provide', 'visual', 'proof', 'know', 'are', 'who', 'say', 'seeing', 'believing', 'when', 'hear', 'people', 'clapping', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'visual', 'proof', 'further', 'adding', 'imprudence', 'incredible', 'number', 'times', 'do', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'once', 'twice', 'limited', 'way', 'dozens', 'dozens', 'times', 'counted', '89', 'times', 'main', 'show', 'alone', 'did', 'shots', 'are', 'more', 'just', 'second', 'two', 'Probably', '70', '%', 'shots', 'were', 'clapping', 'smiling', 'were', 'others', 'people', 'singing', 'even', 'several', '5', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'dancing', 'What', 'treat', 'was', 'camera', 'coverage', 'got', 'made', 'wonder', 'might', 'be', 'video', 'editor', 'daughter', ']', 'Now', 'let', 'reiterate', 'when', 'say', 'clapping', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'applause', 'song', 'selections', 'absolutely', 'fine', 'What', ""'m"", 'talking', 'people', 'simply', 'clapping', 'and/or', 'singing', 'music', 'even', 'worse', 'shots', 'are', 'not', 'doing', 'anything', 'just', 'plain', 'staring', 'Now', 'show', 'hands', 'who', 'go', 'concert', 'sit', 'watch', 'people', 'sitting', 'sing', 'clap', 'music', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'watch', 'audience', 'want', 'see', 'people', 'stage.These', 'garbage', 'shots', 'audience', 'were', 'not', 'frequently', 'used', 'show', 'last', 'Christmas', 'show', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'did', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'was', 'more', 'annoying', 'show', 'Something', 'else', 'find', 'confusing', '3', 'songs', 'were', 'pristine', 'not', 'contaminated', 'video', 'adulteration', 'then', 'other', 'hand', 'even', 'bonus', 'song', 'selections', 'were', 'ruined', 'same', 'video', 'junk', 'have', 'explanation', 'songs', 'were', 'not', ""doctored'.As"", 'concert', 'need', 'Prozac', 'overcome', 'disappointment', 'was', 'psyched', 'up', 'lively', 'new', 'program', 'last', 'tour', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'emotionally', 'depressing', 'songs', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'one', 'not', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'positive', 'therefore', 'exciting', 'NO', 'SUCH', 'LUCK', 'What', 'got', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'hardly', 'song', 'show', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'before', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'same', 'singers', 'singing', 'Additionally', 'when', 'were', 'done', 'before', 'were', 'done', 'so', 'beautifully', 'crazy', 'think', 'could', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'again', 'perfect', 'example', 'dilemma', 'song', 'Caledonia', 'When', 'Lisa', 'Kelly', 'sang', 'Caledonia', 'sang', 'lived', 'Susan', 'McFadden', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'real', 'charmer', 'was', 'mistake', 'let', 'sing', 'song', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'preformed', 'perfectly', 'Celtic', 'Woman', '.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'not', 'everyone', 'viewpoint', 'show', 'respect', 'are', 'individuals', 'have', 'are', 'own', 'opinions', 'likes', 'dislikes', 'can', 'only', 'tell', 'what', 'feelings', 'are', 'presentation', 'Unquestionably', 'many', 'will', 'TOTALLY', 'disagree', 'hopefully', 'will', 'respect', 'honesty', 'really', 'expected', 'something', 'new', 'wonderful', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.Quite', 'honestly', 'hope', 'everyone', 'show', 'girls', 'are', 'extremely', 'talented', 'anything', 'sing', 'worth', 'listening', 'personally', 'felt', 'cheated', 'are', 'other', 'songs', 'could', 'have', 'sung', 'just', 'as', 'magnificently', 'Why', 'did', 'give', 'rerun', '[', 'Please', 'feel', 'free', 'leave', 'comments', ']']",Emerald: Musical Gems - Live in Concert

1689371,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B00HF95PA4,Gary P. Cohen,"[2, 2]","As one who has loved Celtic Woman since discovering them in 2006, I am sadly in agreement with many of the other reviewers who felt this concert was a disappointment.  This concert is sort of a greatest hits but with the songs sung, for the most part, by different members of the group due to the great turnover of singers in recent years.  And there is the main problem.  Susan McFadden is a lovely young woman with a sweet voice.  However asking her to sing &#34;Caledonia&#34; and &#34;The Voice&#34; is a huge mistake.  I first discovered Celtic Woman while listening to Lisa Kelly sing &#34;Caledonia&#34; on the &#34;New Beginning&#34; concert at my local electronics store.  She has always been my favorite and asking someone else to sing her songs is a mistake.This concert begins with Chloe, Susan and Lisa Lambe doing &#34;Awakening.&#34;  Yet the most recent Celtic Woman concert (other than the&#34; Home for Christmas&#34; concert,)&#34; Believe&#34; started the same way, only with Chloe, Lisa Lambe and Lisa Kelly.  It seemed strange to start this concert the exact same way.  Chloe sings her own &#34;Nocturne,&#34; yet it sounded better on the previous concert.  Its that way with most of the concert: &#34;been there, done that.&#34;  Its enjoyable to watch only just not as good as the previous concerts on dvd.  On the plus side, this concert does include 2 of the Celtic Woman dance numbers: &#34;Nil Se'n La&#34; and &#34;Teir Abhaile Riu.&#34;  They are fun but not as interesting due to the limitations of the very unspectacular stage used for this concert.Someone observed that the Celtic Woman concerts show too much of the audience.  I am in complete agreement.  There is a little girl shown singing and dancing to the music THREE TIMES!!.  I think once would have been enough.  (Celtic Woman did the same thing on their first Christmas dvd when they cut away from Lisa Kelly in the wonderful &#34;Let It Snow&#34; number to show an elderly couple laughing and clapping.  I cringe whenever I see it.)Since this concert was filmed last year, Chloe has left Celtic Woman.  However Lisa Lambe is an absolute doll and one of my favorites, Susan McFadden is lovely and Mairead is still amazing, the heart and soul of Celtic Woman.  However it is obvious that not much thought went into this concert and its probably time to put &#34;Dulaman&#34; and &#34;Danny Boy&#34; to rest.  As some have mentioned, David Downes does not even make an appearance until Lisa Lambe's thundering rendition of &#34;Bridge Over Troubled Water&#34; as part of the bonus material.In conclusion, I love Celtic Woman and will be seeing them in concert at Radio City Music Hall in May.  However it is time for some new material.  And if they are going to continue doing their old numbers, wouldn't it be nice to bring back Lisa Kelly, Meav, Orla Fallon, Alex Sharpe, etc. to perform them.  I know this is never going to happen but it is nice to ponder.",4,The Least Interesting Celtic Woman Concert on Blu-Ray/DVD,1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,2951,"['one', 'who', 'loved', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'discovering', '2006', 'am', 'sadly', 'agreement', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'felt', 'concert', 'was', 'disappointment', 'concert', 'sort', 'greatest', 'hits', 'songs', 'sung', 'most', 'part', 'different', 'members', 'group', 'due', 'great', 'turnover', 'singers', 'recent', 'years', 'main', 'problem', 'Susan', 'McFadden', 'lovely', 'young', 'woman', 'sweet', 'voice', 'However', 'asking', 'sing', '34', 'Caledonia', '34', '34', 'Voice', '34', 'huge', 'mistake', 'first', 'discovered', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'listening', 'Lisa', 'Kelly', 'sing', '34', 'Caledonia', '34', '34', 'New', 'Beginning', '34', 'concert', 'local', 'electronics', 'store', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'asking', 'someone', 'else', 'sing', 'songs', 'mistake.This', 'concert', 'Chloe', 'Susan', 'Lisa', 'Lambe', 'doing', '34', 'Awakening.', '34', 'most', 'recent', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'concert', 'other', '34', 'Home', 'Christmas', '34', 'concert', '34', 'Believe', '34', 'started', 'same', 'way', 'only', 'Chloe', 'Lisa', 'Lambe', 'Lisa', 'Kelly', 'seemed', 'strange', 'start', 'concert', 'exact', 'same', 'way', 'Chloe', 'own', '34', 'Nocturne', '34', 'sounded', 'better', 'previous', 'concert', 'way', 'most', 'concert', '34', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'that.', '34', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'only', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'concerts', 'dvd', 'plus', 'side', 'concert', 'include', '2', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'dance', 'numbers', '34', 'Nil', 'Se', 'n', 'La', '34', '34', 'Teir', 'Abhaile', 'Riu.', '34', 'are', 'fun', 'not', 'interesting', 'due', 'limitations', 'very', 'unspectacular', 'stage', 'used', 'concert.Someone', 'observed', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'show', 'too', 'much', 'audience', 'am', 'complete', 'agreement', 'little', 'girl', 'shown', 'singing', 'dancing', 'music', 'THREE', 'TIMES', 'think', 'once', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'first', 'Christmas', 'dvd', 'when', 'cut', 'away', 'Lisa', 'Kelly', 'wonderful', '34', 'Let', 'Snow', '34', 'number', 'show', 'elderly', 'couple', 'laughing', 'clapping', 'cringe', 'whenever', 'see', 'concert', 'was', 'filmed', 'last', 'year', 'Chloe', 'left', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'However', 'Lisa', 'Lambe', 'absolute', 'doll', 'one', 'favorites', 'Susan', 'McFadden', 'lovely', 'Mairead', 'still', 'amazing', 'heart', 'soul', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'However', 'obvious', 'not', 'much', 'thought', 'went', 'concert', 'probably', 'time', 'put', '34', 'Dulaman', '34', '34', 'Danny', 'Boy', '34', 'rest', 'have', 'mentioned', 'David', 'Downes', 'not', 'even', 'make', 'appearance', 'Lisa', 'Lambe', 'thundering', 'rendition', '34', 'Bridge', 'Over', 'Troubled', 'Water', '34', 'part', 'bonus', 'material.In', 'conclusion', 'love', 'Celtic', 'Woman', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'concert', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'Hall', 'May', 'However', 'time', 'new', 'material', 'are', 'going', 'continue', 'doing', 'old', 'numbers', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nice', 'bring', 'back', 'Lisa', 'Kelly', 'Meav', 'Orla', 'Fallon', 'Alex', 'Sharpe', 'etc', 'perform', 'know', 'never', 'going', 'happen', 'nice', 'ponder']",Emerald: Musical Gems - Live in Concert

And she is great here. I felt bad she has to leave - She has been with the band for like, 5 years? Just wonderful. I don't if she is fat but she sings like an angel; now she is also fit and pretty; she should have never left;-Lisa now is the center of the band - she blends in so well. On last DVD she was a little strange, now she is totally blended in. She is great!-The new girl wasn't too impressive but she isn't bad, so that's good news.-All the songs were great! There's no disappointment at all. All 100% and more!-The bass, music were flawless. It's amazing technology keeps improving and it shows on the quality of this blue-ray; the music just fantastic on my HT. Rich bass its just marvelous.-Video was high resolution; it was pretty good, not perfect - some head shots was a little too big; I would appreciate if the video leverage the 20:9 but it's like 16:9 and a little too big sometimes in the center. I guess I could suggest something to make it better but as it is its not too badCON-There's only one but it's a disaster: There's no caption!!!!!! How can anyone sing alone if he doesn't know the song? Can we just hire a Chinese or Indian guy and pay him a day's salary to get the caption done?!! Geez this is unbelievable.
