578388,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005ASOE,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 5]","Lord knows I love me a biopic, and when you cast a great actor in the role of a lifetime, well you can pretty much count me in for a good time.  `Mephisto' is just that type of a film, a strong, rich and vibrant accounting of a very intriguing man and his life, or at least the most pivotal points within it.  The film is entrancing, compassionate, dark and brooding not to mention sensual and titillating.  It has so much going for it that I'm pressed to find a single negative.It may very well be the perfect biopic.`Mephisto' is based off the book written by Klaus Mann, which tells the life story of actor Gustav Grundgens (probably best known for his role in 1933's `M'; an astonishing film).  Gustav's name has been changed for the film to Hendrik Hoefgen, but we all know who this man is.  A vibrant and eccentric stage actor, Hendrik lives and breathes his craft.  His morals are conflicted when his loved ones flee from Germany in fear of Nazi rule and Hoefgen finds himself staying behind, trading his soul so-to-speak for his career.  As Hoefgen slips deeper into his newfound existence we can see how it has taken its toll, transforming him into a person almost unrecognizable to himself or those closest to him.  He gives up so much in the pursuit of his art, and thus defeats himself in the process.The film is expertly crafted to grab out attention and never let it go.  Each scene is haunted by the last, complimenting each other with a delicacy that flourishes within the films bleak realities.There is a softness that blankets the films harsh undertones.The term `role of a lifetime' is used to represent a performance that defines an actor; that focuses on all of their strengths and can be used to either jumpstart or revitalize a career; or maybe just serve as the pinnacle of their success.  Personally I look at Hilary Swank's performance in `Boys Don't Cry' or Marlon Brando in `On the Waterfront' or Meryl Streep in `Sophie's Choice' as examples of this very term.  Klaus Maria Brandauer had that moment here.  His portrayal of the conflicted and haunted Hendrik Hoefgen is utterly genius.  His expert manipulation of his characters emotions and motivations, not to mention our personal grasp of his being, is flawless.  I remember seeing `Out of Africa' for the first time and just gasping over his excellence and wondering where I could see more of him.  I have yet to really research his resume, but this is a performance that would be hard for any actor to top; seriously one of the best of all time.Brandauer is in good company here.  Gyorgy Cserhalmi is wonderful as Hans Miklas, one of Hoefgen's savage adversaries.  Peter Andorai is effective as Otto Ulrichs, one of Hoefgen's dear friends and Karin Boyd is astonishing as Juliette, Hendrik's lover.  I was very impressed with Rolf Hoppe who captured the quiet menace behind General Tabornagy's eyes; such restraint, such power.`Mephisto' is a wonderful film, rich with meaning and an earthy realism that creates a very powerful medium.  With stunning performances, detailed background and beautiful direction, `Mephisto' easily becomes one of the better biopics out there; a film that is as haunting as it is sincere; as important as it is unforgettable.",5,The power of art can be so self-defeating...,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,3238,"['Lord', 'love', 'biopic', 'when', 'cast', 'great', 'actor', 'role', 'lifetime', 'well', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'count', 'good', 'time', 'Mephisto', 'just', 'type', 'film', 'strong', 'rich', 'vibrant', 'accounting', 'very', 'intriguing', 'man', 'life', 'least', 'most', 'pivotal', 'points', 'film', 'entrancing', 'compassionate', 'dark', 'brooding', 'not', 'mention', 'sensual', 'titillating', 'so', 'much', 'going', ""'m"", 'pressed', 'find', 'single', 'negative.It', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'perfect', 'biopic.', 'Mephisto', 'based', 'off', 'book', 'written', 'Klaus', 'Mann', 'life', 'story', 'actor', 'Gustav', 'Grundgens', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'role', '1933', 'M', 'astonishing', 'film', 'Gustav', 'name', 'been', 'changed', 'film', 'Hendrik', 'Hoefgen', 'know', 'who', 'man', 'vibrant', 'eccentric', 'stage', 'actor', 'Hendrik', 'craft', 'morals', 'are', 'conflicted', 'when', 'loved', 'ones', 'flee', 'Germany', 'fear', 'Nazi', 'rule', 'Hoefgen', 'staying', 'trading', 'soul', 'so-to-speak', 'career', 'Hoefgen', 'deeper', 'newfound', 'existence', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'taken', 'toll', 'transforming', 'person', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'closest', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'pursuit', 'art', 'thus', 'defeats', 'process.The', 'film', 'expertly', 'crafted', 'grab', 'out', 'attention', 'never', 'let', 'go', 'scene', 'haunted', 'last', 'complimenting', 'other', 'delicacy', 'films', 'bleak', 'softness', 'films', 'harsh', 'undertones.The', 'term', 'role', 'lifetime', 'used', 'represent', 'performance', 'actor', 'strengths', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'jumpstart', 'revitalize', 'career', 'maybe', 'just', 'serve', 'pinnacle', 'success', 'Personally', 'look', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'performance', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Waterfront', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'examples', 'very', 'term', 'Klaus', 'Maria', 'Brandauer', 'had', 'moment', 'here', 'portrayal', 'conflicted', 'haunted', 'Hendrik', 'Hoefgen', 'utterly', 'genius', 'expert', 'manipulation', 'characters', 'emotions', 'motivations', 'not', 'mention', 'personal', 'grasp', 'being', 'flawless', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Africa', 'first', 'time', 'just', 'gasping', 'over', 'excellence', 'wondering', 'where', 'could', 'see', 'more', 'have', 'yet', 'really', 'research', 'resume', 'performance', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'actor', 'top', 'seriously', 'one', 'best', 'time.Brandauer', 'good', 'company', 'here', 'Gyorgy', 'Cserhalmi', 'wonderful', 'Hans', 'Miklas', 'one', 'Hoefgen', 'savage', 'adversaries', 'Peter', 'Andorai', 'effective', 'Otto', 'Ulrichs', 'one', 'Hoefgen', 'dear', 'friends', 'Karin', 'Boyd', 'astonishing', 'Juliette', 'Hendrik', 'lover', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Rolf', 'Hoppe', 'who', 'captured', 'quiet', 'menace', 'General', 'Tabornagy', 'eyes', 'such', 'restraint', 'such', 'power.', 'Mephisto', 'wonderful', 'film', 'rich', 'meaning', 'earthy', 'realism', 'very', 'powerful', 'medium', 'stunning', 'performances', 'detailed', 'background', 'beautiful', 'direction', 'Mephisto', 'easily', 'one', 'better', 'biopics', 'there', 'film', 'as', 'haunting', 'sincere', 'as', 'important', 'unforgettable']",N/A

578390,ACC1SLND21RI6,B00005ASOE,Breyel,"[5, 5]","Klaus Mann'sMephisto (Penguin Twentieth Century Classics)is based loosely on the legend of Mephistopheles and Doctor Faustus. Only in Mann's version, the characters are members of his family. Enter Hendrik Hoefgen (or Klaus Mann's brother-in-law Gustaf Gr&uuml;ndgens star ofM - Criterion Collection) alias Faust/Mephisto played by Klaus Maria Brandauer.Adapted by Hungarian director Istvan Szabo in this 1981 film rendition, Hendrik Hoefgen is a provincial actor from Hamburg who arrives in Berlin during the Nazi regime's ascendancy, determined to become the greatest thespian in Germany.As his reputation grows, a Hermann G&ouml;ring-type minister (Rolf Hoppe) takes notice of his performance as Mephisto. Over time, for the sake of adulation, fame and social position, he ingratiates himself to his newfound Nazi patron - a more menacing Mephisto -- and is offered all that he desires in the theatrical world.The price? Surrender your Communist convictions, disassociate yourself from your Jewish friends and Afro-German mistress (Karin Boyd), divorce your wife (Mann's sister, Erika). In exchange, act as a puppet spokesman for the Third Reich. He complies and is appointed director of the Prussian theatre, admired as an actor in his role as Mephisto and respected in the Nazi government's social circle.As Nazi control takes hold throughout Germany, Hendrik Hoefgen's colleagues escape to America, or into secret cells, preparing for resistance. His wife leaves. His friends beg him to join them. Although aware of the dangers, he remains behind, believing he can stage works unhindered by the Nazi government. Too late to realise the impracticality of his folly, he complies to survive, winning small victories that give the illusion of freedom.The day of his reckoning comes in the last minutes of the film.  The minister, unwilling to compromise and assist him any further, marches him to what appears to be a huge, dark void - a stage...perhaps hell. He is forced onto it. Spotlights bear down upon him. He runs frantically to and fro. Stops. Looks into the intensely bright light and pleads: ""What do you want? I'm only an actor"".  Absolutely haunting!Although Klaus Mann's novel more or less lampoons the complicity of his brother-in-law with the Nazis, the film explores a flawed and opportunistic, yet all too recognisably human character. One could draw parallels to what becomes of individuals and art when oppressive regimes impinge upon them. Some relent to it in order to survive; others who have a moral conscience flee to fight it.Acting? Klaus Maria Brandauer's performance is so multi-layered, he captures the essence of the actor's psyche for invention and role playing. Equally mesmerising and sinister in his role is Rolf Hoppe. Karin Boyd is also a fascinating and talented actress to watch.The DVD? The version I own must be the first edition release. The film quality appeared to be a scan and pan version. There was no interactive language menu, although English subtitles appeared by default in this German language film. As for the translation, well, some words in German are naturally more meaningful than the English translation. Still, I'm immensely delighted to possess this DVD, considering it is getting nearly impossible to find, and if you do manage to track it down it's available at some ridiculous prices. I can only hope this Oscar winning film will be re-released in the near future. It would be great to see the 1960 German version of this film (""Faust"" starring Gustaf Gr&uuml;ndgens) and some literature discussing Klaus Mann's novel included in a box set.

Erland,"[13, 14]","Note: German with English subtitles.Winner of the '82 Oscar in the category of Best Foreign Film, `Mephisto' provides a fascinating glimpse behind the most notorious regime of the 20th century and the elusive spiritual force that energized its rise to power. Klaus Maria Brandauer is brilliant in the role of Hendrik Hofgen, struggling actor in Berlin circa 1930's whose ability to rationalize and dismiss the growing evil of the Nazi party eventually becomes the embodiment of the dictatorship on stage personified in the figure of Mephisto, ""The spirit who negates.""Writer and director Istvan Szabo has successfully created a unique atmosphere in this production. It is a play within a play, an extravagant distraction of clever words, color and costume designed to enthrall the audience within the theater while malignant socio-political forces move into positions of power and influence in the world outside.The viewer is slowly but surely drawn into the inner world of Hendrik Hofgen. As the film progresses one becomes aware of the myriad of layers to Hendrik's persona and eventually you will begin to peel away the various masks he so ingeniously hides behind. While his onstage performances as Mephisto are dramatic and powerful the essence of the Mephistophelian mythos is lived out off stage away from the bright lights. The manner in which he refuses to acknowledge the devastating and threatening effects of Nazism on Germany, along with the mental machinations employed by the deluded artist to justify his choice to stay in the Motherland are all a reflection of a spirit evil he has so unwittingly embraced.Great film!

Klaus Maria Brandauer gives the performance of his career as actor Hendrik Hoefgen as he moves from a provincial player to acclaimed star and puppet of the Third Reich. The film is much more than a biopic of actor Gustaf Gr&uuml;ndgens it is a subtle analysis of the place of art in an oppressive government.Hoefgen is a political idealist in his native Hamburg wanting to stage plays to bring art to the masses. He gives up his dream when he moves to Berlin and becomes a tool of the National Socialists. The exploration is whether or not true art has a place in this type of government or whether art is just another piece of propaganda that can be used to keep those in power in power. Hoefgen finds that the artist must give up everything including his soul to reach the top. Brandauer's performance is magnificent and he is supported by a great cast. Szabo's long time cinematographer Lajos Koltai  creates a mood of oppression with his intentionally long sweeping shots that sometimes seem to go on forever.The film has long been out of print but can be found at some cost in this Anchor Bay edition which features a slightly dark transfer of the film with English subtitles. The subtitles are clear but may not always accurately translate the original German. The only extras are text biographies of Brandauer and Szabo and a short but vital featurette called The Naked Face which covers both Brandauer's and Szabo's methods for filmmaking.This is a long difficult film but well worth the investment of time for anyone interested in serious foreign films.,4,Complex Political Film,1268438400,"03 13, 2010",2010,1681,"['Istv', 'aacute', 'Szab', 'oacute', 'Mephisto', 'not', 'always', 'easiest', 'film', 'watch', 'careful', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'Klaus', 'Maria', 'Brandauer', 'performance', 'career', 'actor', 'Hendrik', 'Hoefgen', 'provincial', 'player', 'acclaimed', 'star', 'puppet', 'Third', 'Reich', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'biopic', 'actor', 'Gustaf', 'Gr', 'uuml', 'ndgens', 'subtle', 'analysis', 'place', 'art', 'oppressive', 'government.Hoefgen', 'political', 'idealist', 'native', 'Hamburg', 'wanting', 'stage', 'plays', 'bring', 'art', 'masses', 'up', 'dream', 'when', 'Berlin', 'tool', 'National', 'Socialists', 'exploration', 'not', 'true', 'art', 'place', 'type', 'government', 'art', 'just', 'piece', 'propaganda', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'keep', 'power', 'power', 'Hoefgen', 'artist', 'must', 'give', 'up', 'everything', 'including', 'soul', 'reach', 'top', 'Brandauer', 'performance', 'magnificent', 'supported', 'great', 'cast', 'Szabo', 'long', 'time', 'cinematographer', 'Lajos', 'Koltai', 'mood', 'oppression', 'intentionally', 'long', 'sweeping', 'shots', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'go', 'forever.The', 'film', 'long', 'been', 'print', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'cost', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'edition', 'slightly', 'dark', 'transfer', 'film', 'English', 'subtitles', 'subtitles', 'are', 'clear', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'accurately', 'translate', 'original', 'German', 'only', 'extras', 'are', 'text', 'biographies', 'Brandauer', 'Szabo', 'short', 'vital', 'featurette', 'called', 'Naked', 'Face', 'Brandauer', 'Szabo', 'methods', 'filmmaking.This', 'long', 'difficult', 'film', 'well', 'investment', 'time', 'anyone', 'interested', 'serious', 'foreign', 'films']",N/A
578393,A31ELTOVZM5JHR,B00005ASOE,C. Rothlind,"[3, 4]","For years this film was a kind of holy grail to me. I remember the overpowering effect Brandauer's performance had when I saw it during its initial release. That was long before I paid much attention to a film's formal properties. (In the meantime I've become a fan of Bergman, Bresson,  Melville, Kieszlowski, Fassbinder, Kaurismaeki, et al.)That the out-of-print DVD was only available at exorbitant sums (scarcity value) only added to the film's allure.Re-watching it I was surprised to find myself put-off by the dubbing necessary to bring the international cast into synch. I've always hated dubbing, a practice that makes Italian films so off-putting. Brandauer certainly hams it up, to great effect in places. But I quickly tired of him the second time around. The shock-value was nullified, and the film's value lies mainly in his manic self-display.The liberties taken with Goethe's Faust text (the audience applauds the line ""Du bleibst doch immer was du bist"" as if it were the end of an act) annoyed me. And the actor playing Faust appears to have been lobotomized. In a film that relies on performances as much as Mephisto, such flaws are glaring. Non-German language speakers innocent of Goethe's play won't have such issues, of course.The other thing I found amateurish was the random and additive feel of the emplotment and editing. The intriguing inevitability and dramatic power that truly great films possess was missing. It just felt slapped-together. ""Breezy"" is not the mood/style I would have chosen to render this story. And I have no doubt any number of directors working today could have fashioned a more coherent film. There's just too much French New-wave sensibility at work here.Mephisto is obviously low-budget. The ""costumes"" don't have a authentic period feel & look like something from of a second-hand store. A 1970s take on the 40s. (In this respect it reminded me a bit of modernism of Bertolluci's ""The Conformist"".)I haven't seen anything by Szabo that felt formally compelling.

It is based on a novel written by Klaus Mann (son of the famous German author Thomas Mann), which is loosely based upon the real-life story of Klaus's actual brother in law, famous German actor Gustaf Grundgens.

578395,A2L558FW150WMS,B00005ASOE,Glen Koehn,"[16, 17]","""Mephisto"" carries a big message about integrity and betrayal.  Its central character is a conflicted man who plays Mephistopheles on the stage, while offstage trading his own soul to the Nazis for fame and influence.There is a fascinating background to the film, and to the 1936 Klaus Mann novel of the same title.  It's often pointed out that the main character Hoefgen is a portrait of the actor Gustav Grundgens, who was married to Klaus Mann's sister Erika in the 1920's.  Another literary connection: W. H. Auden later assisted Erika's escape from Germany by means of a marriage of convenience.In the film, the devilish Hoefgen marries an angelic Erika figure and there is an amusing scene in ""heaven"" at the Mann family home where he chokes on the food served.  Interestingly, one of the more admirable characters is a sometime Nazi whose courage is a foil to Hoefgen's compromises.  There are persuasively menacing analogues of Hermann Goering and Josef Goebbels.Klaus Maria Brandauer does a virtuoso job acting as the actor Hoefgen.  Yet another layer of meaning is added to this complex movie by the fact that its director Szabo was from Communist Hungary, where artists faced their own choices about whether and how to collaborate with authority.  Check out the scene where Hoefgen interprets Hamlet to journalists as a National Socialist hero.Klaus Mann fled Germany before WWII and killed himself in France in 1949, while Grundgens had a notably successful career in the Third Reich and afterward.  His Dusseldorf theater made a fine recording of Faust 1 for Deutsche Grammophon in the early 1950's.  (It's now out on CD from DG Literatur, available from amazon.de.)

Ebert should have emphasized this more.--JMVMephisto (1981)BY ROGER EBERT / August 21, 2008By Roger EbertIn ""Mephisto,"" a movie that takes place in Germany during the rise of Nazism, there are many insults, but the most wounding is simply the word ""actor""! It is screamed at the film's hero by his sponsor, a Nazi general who is in charge of cultural affairs. We stare into the actor's face, but are unable to determine what he is thinking, or what he is feeling. Maybe that is what makes him a great actor and an ignoble human being.The actor is played by Klaus Maria Brandauer, in a performance of electrifying power; he makes us intensely fascinated by his character while keeping us on the outside -- until we discover there is no inside. He plays an actor named Hendrik Hoefgen, but even that's not quite right; his real name is ""Heinz"" until he upgrades it. (""My name is not my name,"" he says to himself, ""because I am an actor."") Hoefgen bitterly reveals early on that what he hates most about himself is that he is a ""provincial actor."" Eventually he will become Germany's most famous and admired actor, and the head of its State Theater, but that progression is in fact a descent into hell.We should begin by noting how particularly ""Mephisto"" (1981) makes its details vivid: The look and feel of the theater, the rise of the Nazi Party from the 1920s through the 1930s, the Berlin social life that was itself a stage. The film's Hungarian director, Istvan Szabo, demonstrates that the Nazi uniforms themselves seemed to transform some people into Nazis, just as costumes and makeup can make some actors into other people. The uniforms are deliberately fetishistic; to wear them is to subjugate yourself to the system that designed them. And we sense the sadomasochistic undertones that helped seduce a ruling class into a system of evil.The film opens in Hamburg, where Hoefgen is involved in a small-time theater scene that is later described as communist, bourgeois, decadent -- everything but National Socialist. Consumed with ambition, he throws himself into his work with abandon. During a meeting to discuss the props for one production, he hears the words ""lamppost"" and flies into a manic fury, declaring that the lamppost, and the exploited worker woman who stands beneath it, symbolize all that is rotten with Germany. He leaps from the stage into the auditorium, screaming that the lampposts will not be confined to the stage but will extend into the orchestra! -- the dress circle! the entire theater! -- as their revolutionary spirit unites actors and audience. The others look at him with astonishment.Of course this is all acting, posturing, calling attention to himself. Hoefgen as played by Brandauer has not a moment's self-doubt as an actor, although as a human being, he is nothing but doubt, fear and abnegation. He is ruled by ambition. His first wife is the daughter of a powerful man. When the man falls from grace, the wife is divorced. His early friends are left wing; later he drops them, forgets them or tries to shield a few from the Nazis as a gesture toward his abandoned ideals. On the day of Hitler's election, a left-wing friend asks him to join a protest movement in the theater. He can't accept, and he can't refuse: ""I'd rather stay with the reserves."" In fact, his early beliefs are the same as his later ones; he goes from the far left to the far right without the slightest difficulty, because he never believed anything in the first place.Having not seen ""Mephisto"" since the early 1980s, I came back to it again thinking it was an anti-Nazi film. Not entirely. The Nazis are simply ... opportunists. Hoefgen wants to be famous, rich and admired. He purrs at praise like a cat given cream. He can discuss with himself the rights and wrongs of his situation, but it is a strategic discussion, not a moral one. All of his romances and marriages are designed to further his career, except one, which begins in Hamburg and continues unbroken into his Berlin days as the favorite actor of the Reich. This is his affair with Juliette (Karin Boyd), who had a German father and an African mother, and as a black woman, violates all the twisted Nazi theories of racial purity.It bothers Hoefgen not at all that he is both a Nazi puppet and a black woman's partner because his feelings for Juliette are not love -- and not even lust, I think, but a certain enjoyment of the way she understands him. She has his number. They can never be seen together in public, but in her boudoir, she freely insults him. He is such a bad actor, she says, that he can't even drink a beer like a man who wants to drink a beer. And later: ""Sometimes your cold, cheating eyes are those of a sad child."" How does he respond to that? Almost as if it is a compliment. He looks in a mirror to see if it is true!The key to Hoefgen's rise is the cultural czar of the Reich, referred to only as the General (Rolf Hoppe). He is oddly attracted to Hoefgen, and sees to it that the actor's leftist past is erased, he gets the best roles, he rises to lead the State Theater. The General is well into middle age, well-fed, warm, with a pleasing smile and a feminine seductiveness when he pays compliments. All until his brutal speech that ends with the word ""actor!"" Hoppe's performance is the ideal counterpoint to Brandauer's; the actor plays every role to please, and the Nazi pleases only himself, whatever it may seem.Hoefgen's great role is Mephistopheles, the devil. In a mask of stark white makeup, he tempts Dr. Faustus in the classic German drama by Goethe. ""My Mephisto,"" the General calls Hoefgen fondly, over and over again. It is a rich irony, since the General is in fact playing the Mephistopheles role and throwing the world at Hoefgen's feet. Szabo illustrates this contrast in a remarkable scene. Between acts of ""Faust,"" Hoefgen is asked to visit the General's box in the theater. He does, in full makeup and costume. Below, the theatergoers turn and look up as the satanic figure with his red-lined cape hovers smilingly over the Nazi in full dress uniform. Szabo ends this interlude with a shot, held just long enough, showing the entire audience standing transfixed. They have witnessed the devil calling on the state.In the energy they bring to the film, Brandauer and Szabo have made a mighty statement, but it is as much about acting, I think, as Nazism. In Hoefgen, we see an empty man, standing for nothing. This doesn't even bother him. In Paris as a spokesman for Nazi cultural affairs, he reunites with Juliette, who begs him to defect to the West. Later, on the street, he breathes the air of France with that smug contented smile and says to himself, ""What could I do here? Freedom? What for?"" Then he descends into the black pit of the Metro.The lineage behind the story is interesting. Szabo adapted a satirical novel by Klaus Mann (son of Thomas), whose mother was a Jew and whose German citizenship was stripped away in 1933; he later became an American citizen. His book was said to be inspired by his brother-in-law Gustaf Grundgens, an actor and Nazi collaborator. Szabo himself (born 1938) is a leading Hungarian director; his credits include ""Confidence"" (1980), ""Colonel Retl"" (1985) and such English-language films as ""Sunshine"" (1999) and ""Being Julia"" (2004). ""Mephisto"" won the Oscar for best foreign film of 1981, and richly deserved it.As a physical production, the film is breathtaking. Szabo makes the General's office a throne surrounded by empty space. He creates elegant party scenes at which the connected people gossip about one another; they climax with a spectacular celebration at the Grunewald hunting lodge. Huge swastikas turn ordinary buildings into fearful ones. The mechanism by which some people are exiled and others ""disappear"" is condensed into brief, fearful automobile rides. No effort is made to depict Hitler or German militarism or large-scale persecution of the Jews; all that takes place offstage, considering that the stage is Hoefgen's life. And Szabo ends the film with a visual masterstroke in which Hoefgen is able at last to have the limelight all to himself.",5,Roger Ebert: The Film ( review written 2008)--some

As a German lawyer indicted for enforcing Nazi ideology, he asked whether it was more moral to have fled the country the way others did in disgust, or to stay and try and moderate in a kind of passive protest. Brandauer faces the same dilema, though his predicament is given the added irony of him being an actor, a person assumed to lack an identity. However Szabo doesn't demonize the character, which may have something to do with Szabo continuing to make movies in Hungary after the Russians invaded, as evidence of the adjustment of the working artist. We may think that Mephisto's decision to stay on is ill-advised since we know the Nazis to be fickle in their allegiance, but we don't admonish him for being an opportunist. And Brandauer lets us see this actor is more than just a performer, and particularly in one close-up where his contempt for the Nazi Prime Minister is hidden behind the mask of host. The material is taken from the novel by Klaus Mann, the son of Thomas Mann, and allegedly based on the marriage of Erika Mann (Klaus' sister) to the actor Gustav Grundgens, who appeared in Fritz Lang's M and toured Faust internationally after the war. As metaphor the Faust legend is apt, with a man who sells his soul to the devil, though the Hamlet analogy also used with Brandauer as the Nazi's Hamlet is less successful. Szabo creates an hypnotic mood of continuous dread. We are in constant fear for what will become of Mephisto, especially when he tries to protect friends, and of the horror of the Nazi's represented by the Goring-like Prime Minister. His fatness suggests both an over-ripe sensuality and a barbaric ignorance. At one point he even says &quot;When I hear the word culture I reach for my revolver&quot;. Szabo gets a laugh from a montage of Brandaeur's entrances in various theatre roles, after he closes a curtain from an argument, and Brandaeur himself gets us on side with his first appearance howling in a jealous tantrum backstage. It is rumoured that Grundgens was a homosexual, who also had a relationship with Klaus Mann, and while Brandaeur doesn't make this overt, his fay dancing and the platonic marriages he enters into may reveal subtext.",5,swastikas and greasepaint,991267200,"05 31, 2001",2001,2359,"['Hungarian', 'director', 'Istvan', 'Szabo', 'tale', 'Klaus', 'Maria', 'Brandauer', 'actor', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'reminded', 'problem', 'posed', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Judgment', 'Nuremburg', 'German', 'lawyer', 'indicted', 'enforcing', 'Nazi', 'ideology', 'asked', 'was', 'more', 'moral', 'have', 'fled', 'country', 'way', 'others', 'did', 'disgust', 'stay', 'try', 'moderate', 'kind', 'passive', 'protest', 'Brandauer', 'same', 'dilema', 'predicament', 'given', 'added', 'irony', 'being', 'actor', 'person', 'assumed', 'lack', 'identity', 'However', 'Szabo', ""n't"", 'demonize', 'character', 'may', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'Szabo', 'continuing', 'make', 'movies', 'Hungary', 'Russians', 'invaded', 'evidence', 'adjustment', 'working', 'artist', 'may', 'think', 'Mephisto', 'decision', 'stay', 'ill-advised', 'know', 'Nazis', 'be', 'fickle', 'allegiance', 'do', ""n't"", 'admonish', 'being', 'opportunist', 'Brandauer', 'see', 'actor', 'more', 'just', 'performer', 'particularly', 'one', 'close-up', 'where', 'contempt', 'Nazi', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'hidden', 'mask', 'host', 'material', 'taken', 'novel', 'Klaus', 'Mann', 'son', 'Thomas', 'Mann', 'allegedly', 'based', 'marriage', 'Erika', 'Mann', 'Klaus', 'sister', 'actor', 'Gustav', 'Grundgens', 'who', 'appeared', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'M', 'toured', 'Faust', 'internationally', 'war', 'metaphor', 'Faust', 'legend', 'apt', 'man', 'who', 'soul', 'devil', 'Hamlet', 'analogy', 'also', 'used', 'Brandauer', 'Nazi', 'Hamlet', 'less', 'successful', 'Szabo', 'hypnotic', 'mood', 'continuous', 'dread', 'are', 'constant', 'fear', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'Mephisto', 'especially', 'when', 'protect', 'friends', 'horror', 'Nazi', 'represented', 'Goring-like', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'fatness', 'over-ripe', 'sensuality', 'barbaric', 'ignorance', 'one', 'point', 'even', 'quot', 'When', 'hear', 'word', 'culture', 'reach', 'revolver', 'quot', 'Szabo', 'laugh', 'montage', 'Brandaeur', 'entrances', 'various', 'theatre', 'roles', 'curtain', 'argument', 'Brandaeur', 'side', 'first', 'appearance', 'howling', 'jealous', 'tantrum', 'backstage', 'rumoured', 'Grundgens', 'was', 'homosexual', 'who', 'also', 'had', 'relationship', 'Klaus', 'Mann', 'Brandaeur', ""n't"", 'make', 'overt', 'fay', 'dancing', 'platonic', 'marriages', 'may', 'reveal', 'subtext']",N/A
578402,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00005ASOE,Randy Keehn,"[3, 4]","""Mephisto"" is an excellent movie about the price of the pursuit of fame.  Our ""hero"" is an actor who believes himself to be talented in his profession.  However, he is depressed that his fame is locally limited to Hamburg, Germany.  What would it take for him to gain national fame and adoration?  There seems to be no real opportunities for him.  His life in Hamburg is that of an artist in the 1930's; associations with those on the Left and participation in ""revolutionary"" theatre.  Out of frustration, he takes a cut in pay to venture to the big time of Berlin theater.  Here he has an opportunity to throw himself in with the emerging Nazi party.  His opportunism pays off and he succeeds because of his open compromising of his principles (and his principals, too, for that matter).  The movie concludes with just enough uncertainty to let us draw our own conclusions.The story was predictable but the excellence of the movie is in the acting and directing.  Actors playing actors can be a bit overdone or underdone and I'm not sure what category ""Mephisto"" fits into.  The lead actor, Klaus Brandauer, does an excellent job as does the actor who portrays the Prime Minister.  The supporting cast is very good as well.  There are a number of scenes that are scripted and directed to bring out both the obvious and the subtle.  The most impressive touch is one I'm surprized I even noticed but it became, for my interpretation, the sign of the ""kiss of death"".  It was a brief and innocuous scene in which certain persons entered an automobile.  When I saw it the first time, it only registered because it was slightly different that what I was used to seeing.  The second time it occurred, I was aware that this was not a good sign.  There are plenty more touches to this movie that suggest, surprize, and sustain the audience.  I was prepared to rate this with 4 stars but I realize that it is continuing to sink in even as I write this.",5,Selling His Soul,1177977600,"05 1, 2007",2007,1945,"['Mephisto', 'excellent', 'movie', 'price', 'pursuit', 'fame', 'hero', 'actor', 'who', 'be', 'talented', 'profession', 'However', 'depressed', 'fame', 'locally', 'limited', 'Hamburg', 'Germany', 'What', 'would', 'take', 'gain', 'national', 'fame', 'adoration', 'be', 'real', 'opportunities', 'life', 'Hamburg', 'artist', '1930', 'associations', 'Left', 'participation', 'revolutionary', 'theatre', 'frustration', 'cut', 'pay', 'venture', 'big', 'time', 'Berlin', 'theater', 'Here', 'opportunity', 'throw', 'emerging', 'Nazi', 'party', 'opportunism', 'off', 'open', 'compromising', 'principles', 'principals', 'too', 'matter', 'movie', 'just', 'enough', 'uncertainty', 'let', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions.The', 'story', 'was', 'predictable', 'excellence', 'movie', 'acting', 'directing', 'Actors', 'playing', 'actors', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'overdone', 'underdone', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'category', 'Mephisto', 'lead', 'actor', 'Klaus', 'Brandauer', 'excellent', 'job', 'actor', 'who', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'are', 'number', 'scenes', 'are', 'scripted', 'directed', 'bring', 'out', 'obvious', 'subtle', 'most', 'impressive', 'touch', 'one', ""'m"", 'surprized', 'even', 'noticed', 'became', 'interpretation', 'sign', 'kiss', 'death', 'was', 'brief', 'innocuous', 'scene', 'certain', 'persons', 'entered', 'automobile', 'When', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'only', 'registered', 'was', 'slightly', 'different', 'what', 'was', 'used', 'seeing', 'second', 'time', 'occurred', 'was', 'aware', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'are', 'plenty', 'more', 'touches', 'movie', 'suggest', 'surprize', 'sustain', 'audience', 'was', 'prepared', 'rate', '4', 'stars', 'realize', 'continuing', 'sink', 'even', 'write']",N/A
578403,AAS7VH7K9XSYZ,B00005ASOE,"Ronald Steury ""Doc Ron""","[2, 19]","My wife and I have just seen this film at the Traverse City Film Festival and I was interested whether I could get the DVD. I ""was"" interested until I saw the prices for the used copies since, apparently, it is now out of print.Mephisto was our fifth movie of the day. Interestingly, we came to the venue featuring this film having just finished seeing Donnersmarck's ""The Lives of Others."" Both deal with totalitarian regimes controlling artists and the compromises those artists choose to tolerate... or not. ""Lives"" was elegant, involving, and heart-wrenching. ""Mephisto"" was odd and disorienting right from the start, and felt sterile and staged in comparison. The audience (the small auditorium was only a third filled, much to my surprise) had almost no response and a significant number of people walked out before the film was over (OK, it started at 10 PM and perhaps some people just couldn't keep their eyes open to read the subtitles.) Meanwhile, ""Lives"" played to a large, packed auditorium that was silent and attentive throughout, and broke into extended applause at the perfectly fitting final line. ""Mephisto's"" final line is also famous (or so I read), but comes so abruptly that I could hardly digest it before the lights came up. There was not one clap (or response of any kind) at the end of ""Mephisto"" (which is very unusual at the Traverse City Film Festival) and the audience filed out silently with little conversation.Yes, I know that not all great films evoke a warm audience response, but the difference between the two films was undeniable and I suspect the impact of the films on those who saw both will be in the same proportion as the reaction I saw. Actually, I wanted a DVD of ""Mephisto"" so that I could see it once more to attempt to understand why some people I respect a great deal thought this was one of the best films of the 80's. To me it seemed stilted and confusing, Further, there was no one in the film that I could identify with or that I truly cared about. And forgive me, but isn't the story obvious and predictable by the time you get to the 45 minute mark? Yes, it was sad to see the protagonist continually delude himself as to his compromises and motives, but how long does that hold one's interest? Especially when you really don't like him very much or care what happens to him?So no, I will not be shelling out 50+ bucks for the DVD. Maybe I'll rent it one day again. Sometimes I really do wonder why certain films get such fantastic reputations when so few people really seem to enjoy watching them.
