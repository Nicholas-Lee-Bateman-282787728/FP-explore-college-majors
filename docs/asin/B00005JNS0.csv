CARS certainly has dazzling animation and its basic selfish guy gets a heart premise will probably find its way into the hearts of the families that watch it.  Is it really all that different?  Other than the fact that the characters are CARS, it's really just a rehash of films like ICE AGE, OVER THE HEDGE, ETC. ETC.  But one can't deny it's entertainment value.  Randy Newman's delightful song OUR TOWN will probably garner him another nomination, and the voicing is really fun.  Owen Wilson is speedster Lightning McQueen, the hero whose self-importance takes a bruising when he finds himself in the small almost deserted town of Radiator Springs.

The whole human world has been transfigured, as ""Braking News"" comes on television, and cars watch their fellow heroes in Nascar-type races in the stands.  Playfully, we enter into the world of ""Lightning McQueen"" (Owen Wilson) who is trying to win his first ""Piston Cup"".  He is full of himself and not just engine oil, so he lazily creates a three-way tie with two other prima dona cars.  The tie-breaker takes place in California, but his smugness gets him off guard, and he is stuck with a sleepy desert town, Radiator Springs, off Route 66.  Here he meets some interesting fellow cars, including Hudson ""Doc"" Hornet (Paul Newman), a former racer and the town's judge, a rundown tow truck, Mater (Larry, the Cable Guy), and Sally, a Porche from L.A., enjoying the slower life as a lawyer in the country.  There's a love interest, but her distaste for his ego provides a series of events to have his egomania retreaded.'Cars' has a lot of heart inside its chasis.  We forget we are dealing with cars that our laughter and tears come to the fore without us thinking about it.  It's the human comedy with a theme to reflect on slowing down and enjoying the road(s) in life.  Surprisingly effective, the story is beautifully executed with nuances like vocal appearances by Bob Costas and Richard Petty, which authenticate the movie even more.'Cars' is the best of a great lot of animated features this year.

The Car Talk comedians make a brief, not-so-funny appearance in the first scenes. Still, I, my 14-year-old son and his aunt came away happy, despite the predictable and corny story line.At the grand opening event, rookie racer Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) vies for the coveted Piston Cup against incumbent champion, The King (Richard Petty), and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), who is determined to best his perennial second-place, at all costs. The rookie, naturally full of himself, expects to step from peddling Rusteze into big league Dynaco sponsorship. But the three tie for first place, and a tie-breaker is scheduled in California. Lightning immediately sets off, aboard his faithful truck, Mack (John Ratzenberger). En route, Mack's back panel accidentally opens and the sleeping Lightning falls out on the dark interstate, where he is awakened by the roar of oncoming traffic.Frantic to find Mack, Lightning chases the wrong truck off the interstate and winds up on Route 66 in Radiator Springs. That's where the fun starts. Race cars have no lights, and Lightning drives blindly, tearing up the road as he goes.In court, mechanic, judge and 1951 Hudson Hornet Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) are inclined (the last, for secret reasons) to let Lightning go, but local attorney Sally (Bonnie Hunt) pressures the judge to make him repair the road he has destroyed. During his days at work, Lightning is befriended by Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), and eventually by all the other town characters as well, including Sally, Sheriff (Michael Wallis), tire store owner Luigi (Tony Shalhoub) and his sidekick Guido (Guido Quaroni), a retired army jeep named Sarge (Paul Dooley), a shabby VW bus, Fillmore (George Carlin)--and even the Doc, whose historical racing championships Lightning discovers and advertises.There are plenty of twists and turns in this albeit predictable road, but the end result is an instant classic, filled with great Randy Newman music, terrific scenery and some wonderful lessons about friends, community and the importance of keeping things in perspective.We loved it, cliches and all.--Alyssa A.

634237,AC7J2CCGFQXY9,B00005JNS0,"Amazon Customer ""fairytales&dreams""","[5, 6]","I love Pixar films, they are always poignant, yet funny, not to mention the animation is awesome.  While Cars is not my favorite Pixar movie, it was still entertaining and fun to watch.Lightning McQueen is a flashy and selfish race car on his way to California to race in the big Piston Cup race and while on the highway his ride (a Mack truck called ""Mack""heh) falls asleep and somehow the ramp drops down and lets a sleeping McQueen out onto the highway.  While Mack continues on his way oblivious McQueen is not on board, McQueen suddenly realizes that he can't find his ride and is stuck in the middle of nowhere.He speeds around looking for Mack and unfortunately, gets a police car from a small town of Radiator Springs off route 66, on his tail.  He gets in trouble and ends up having to serve a community service sentence by fixing the road into town that he messed up in his police car chase.  McQueen isn't too happy about this as he's supposed to be in California for the race in a week, but the town leader, Doc Hudson (who presided over his case as judge) is adamant he serve his sentence and McQueen is resigned to his unlucky fate.I thought there were a lot of funny parts in the movie and I found myself laughing out loud at a lot of the scenes.  Instead of ""cow tipping"", there is ""tractor tipping"", and the scene where McQueen and Tow Mater (a rusty tow truck) decide to go tractor tipping was hilarious.  Another funny moment was when the 2 Italian cars that owned the local tire store, and their love of all things Ferrari, finally meet a real life Ferrari (their reactions were so cute!).I loved the message in the movie.  That fame, fortune, and looking out for number one isn't what life is all about, that the love and companionship of friends and family is far more lasting.  It was heart-warming to see the change in the brash Lightning McQueen, as the town of Radiator Springs and its locals, slowly effect his outlook on life.

As was brought to my attention by a fellow Ammy buddy, I do tend to be extra harsh to films that seem to get `undeserved' praise and attention.  I feel at times like I need to knock them down a peg.  I think that, for the most part, the world agrees that `Cars' is one of Pixar's weakest films.  They may not loathe it as I do, but I don't think anyone is going to try and make a case for `Cars' being a better film than `Up' or `Finding Nemo'.  What I find upsetting is that people actually like this film at all.It's not funny, it's not witty, it's not charming, it's not fresh, it's not exciting, it's not really much of anything other than a complete waste of time.UGH, I hate this movie.The film tells the story of a selfish hotshot race car who gets lost on his way to an important race and winds up doing some heavy damage to a road in Radiator Springs.  He can't leave until he helps fix what he's done, and in the process his eyes are opened and his life is changed (or at least his `outlook' on that life).  He meets an array of shiny (and rusty) new friends (well, not at first) who teach him some valuable life lessons.The film is shiny, but at the same time it is rather one-note.  The voice acting is effective, not nothing truly noteworthy.  The plot is simple and rather `cookie cutter', and that isn't helped by the lackluster script that layers that characters with clich&eacute; dialog and gags that are almost mind-numbing in their inability to illicit a genuine response from the audience (and by audience I mean ME since I am the only audience that matters in my personal opinion of this film).In a word, this film is just `boring'.",1,Time for a car wash...,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,1694,"['have', 'huge', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'brought', 'attention', 'fellow', 'Ammy', 'buddy', 'do', 'tend', 'be', 'extra', 'harsh', 'films', 'seem', 'get', 'undeserved', 'praise', 'attention', 'feel', 'times', 'need', 'knock', 'down', 'peg', 'think', 'most', 'part', 'world', 'Cars', 'one', 'Pixar', 'weakest', 'films', 'may', 'not', 'loathe', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'going', 'try', 'make', 'case', 'Cars', 'being', 'better', 'film', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'What', 'find', 'upsetting', 'people', 'actually', 'film', 'all.It', 'not', 'funny', 'not', 'witty', 'not', 'charming', 'not', 'fresh', 'not', 'exciting', 'not', 'really', 'much', 'anything', 'other', 'complete', 'waste', 'time.UGH', 'hate', 'movie.The', 'film', 'story', 'selfish', 'hotshot', 'race', 'car', 'who', 'lost', 'way', 'important', 'race', 'up', 'doing', 'heavy', 'damage', 'road', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'fix', 'what', 'done', 'process', 'eyes', 'are', 'opened', 'life', 'changed', 'least', 'outlook', 'life', 'array', 'shiny', 'rusty', 'new', 'friends', 'well', 'not', 'first', 'who', 'teach', 'valuable', 'life', 'lessons.The', 'film', 'shiny', 'same', 'time', 'rather', 'one-note', 'voice', 'acting', 'effective', 'not', 'nothing', 'truly', 'noteworthy', 'plot', 'simple', 'rather', 'cookie', 'cutter', ""n't"", 'helped', 'lackluster', 'script', 'characters', 'clich', 'eacute', 'dialog', 'gags', 'are', 'almost', 'mind-numbing', 'inability', 'illicit', 'genuine', 'response', 'audience', 'audience', 'mean', 'ME', 'am', 'only', 'audience', 'matters', 'personal', 'opinion', 'film', 'word', 'film', 'just', 'boring']",N/A

What really attracted me to Cars in the first place, however, was the fact that it had Larry the Cable Guy in it, as the lovable but somewhat dimwitted Tow Mater (known throughout the film simply as Mater), seeing as I am a HUGE fan of Larry's material.  I finally got to see the movie as a result of a bootleg copy I got from a friend.  I must say, it is one of THE best Disney movies I have ever seen.  It was very family-friendly and overall quite hilarious.*Warning- Spoilers Ahead... Proceed With Caution*The premise is quite simple: a NASCAR-like superstar named Lightning McQueen is one of three cars that tied for entrance into the Piston Cup, one of the most premier races in the nation.  While on his way to the race, however, his transport truck Mac falls asleep, allowing Lightning to roll out the back of Mac's tailflap; when Lightning awakens, he chases down what he thinks is Mac, but isn't.  He finally stops in the quiet little town of Radiator Springs... but not before ripping a statue of an engine out of its base and completely tearing up the main road through the city.  The judge and town lawyer (who happens to be a very attractive female car [I feel really weird saying that]) sentence him to repave the road before he can leave for the race.  He ends up having to repave the road twice, cause the first time he didn't do it right and the road was all bumpy.Throughout the film, Lightning's pride almost stops him from being able to make the friendships he does while in Radiator Springs; guys like Mater (played/voiced superbly by Blue Collar Comedy Tour regular Larry the Cable Guy), a rusty old pickup truck who runs a towing company (Tow Mater... get it?  hahaha... ok.  I'll stop.) and Doc Hudson, a old (1951, I believe) Hudson Hornet who was the winner of 3 Piston Cups during his own racing days.  He eventually becomes Mater's ""new best friend"" and goes out on a tractor-tipping expedition with him... which, btw, is one of the funniest scenes in the whole movie.  The movie ends like you wouldn't expect it to (hint: Lightning doesn't win the Piston Cup), but Lightning ends up making a decision that leaves everyone watching with a nice, warm, happy feeling inside.  ^_^One of the nice things about Cars is that, like Finding Nemo, it is quite the unconventional movie.  The title suggests that the movie will have something to do with racing and/or cars, but the real delight is in that the main characters are the cars, not the racecar drivers; in fact, there are no drivers.  The cars in Cars are completely autonomous (they move on their own) but can talk, drive, and overall act like regular humans... remind you of the fish in Finding Nemo (which reminds me... I haven't reviewed F.N. yet... watch for my review a bit later).  It's also, as I said, very funny, yet completely ""safe for the whole family"", to borrow the slogan of a local Christian radio station.  I personally loved the movie and would highly and enthusiastically recommend this for anyone who loves movies about cars... or for that matter movies in general.Rated: GAndy ~O~",5,"so far, so good...",1160179200,"10 7, 2006",2006,3607,"['Disney', 'movies', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'thing', 'example', 'recently', 'bought', 'few', 'movies', 'WalMart', 'Serenity', 'Slither', 'Final', 'Destination', 'II', 'none', 'are', 'Disney', 'movies', 'used', 'think', 'Disney', 'movies', 'were', 'mainly', 'kids', 'Granted', 'do', 'have', 'entire', 'Lilo', 'Stitch', 'series', 'late', 'Disney', 'experiences', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'old', 'WD', 'movies', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Finding', 'Nemo', '5-year', 'old', 'cousin', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'rip', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'actually', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'What', 'really', 'attracted', 'Cars', 'first', 'place', 'however', 'was', 'fact', 'had', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'lovable', 'somewhat', 'dimwitted', 'Tow', 'Mater', 'known', 'film', 'simply', 'Mater', 'seeing', 'am', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'Larry', 'material', 'finally', 'got', 'see', 'movie', 'result', 'bootleg', 'copy', 'got', 'friend', 'must', 'say', 'one', 'THE', 'best', 'Disney', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'very', 'family-friendly', 'overall', 'quite', 'hilarious', '*Warning-', 'Spoilers', 'Ahead', 'Proceed', 'Caution*The', 'premise', 'quite', 'simple', 'NASCAR-like', 'superstar', 'named', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'one', 'three', 'cars', 'tied', 'entrance', 'Piston', 'Cup', 'one', 'most', 'premier', 'races', 'nation', 'way', 'race', 'however', 'transport', 'truck', 'Mac', 'asleep', 'allowing', 'Lightning', 'roll', 'out', 'back', 'Mac', 'tailflap', 'when', 'Lightning', 'awakens', 'down', 'what', 'Mac', ""n't"", 'finally', 'quiet', 'little', 'town', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'not', 'ripping', 'statue', 'engine', 'base', 'completely', 'tearing', 'up', 'main', 'road', 'city', 'judge', 'town', 'lawyer', 'who', 'be', 'very', 'attractive', 'female', 'car', '[', 'feel', 'really', 'weird', 'saying', ']', 'sentence', 'repave', 'road', 'can', 'leave', 'race', 'up', 'having', 'repave', 'road', 'twice', 'cause', 'first', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'right', 'road', 'was', 'film', 'Lightning', 'pride', 'almost', 'being', 'able', 'make', 'friendships', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'guys', 'Mater', 'played/voiced', 'superbly', 'Blue', 'Collar', 'Comedy', 'Tour', 'regular', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'rusty', 'old', 'pickup', 'truck', 'who', 'towing', 'company', 'Tow', 'Mater', 'get', 'hahaha', 'ok', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'Doc', 'Hudson', 'old', '1951', 'believe', 'Hudson', 'Hornet', 'who', 'was', 'winner', '3', 'Piston', 'Cups', 'own', 'racing', 'days', 'eventually', 'Mater', 'new', 'best', 'friend', 'out', 'tractor-tipping', 'expedition', 'btw', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'whole', 'movie', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'hint', 'Lightning', ""n't"", 'win', 'Piston', 'Cup', 'Lightning', 'up', 'making', 'decision', 'everyone', 'watching', 'nice', 'warm', 'happy', 'feeling', 'inside', '^_^One', 'nice', 'things', 'Cars', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'quite', 'unconventional', 'movie', 'title', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'racing', 'and/or', 'cars', 'real', 'delight', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'cars', 'not', 'racecar', 'drivers', 'fact', 'are', 'drivers', 'cars', 'Cars', 'are', 'completely', 'autonomous', 'move', 'own', 'can', 'talk', 'drive', 'overall', 'act', 'regular', 'humans', 'remind', 'fish', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'have', ""n't"", 'reviewed', 'F.N', 'yet', 'watch', 'review', 'bit', 'later', 'also', 'said', 'very', 'funny', 'yet', 'completely', 'safe', 'whole', 'family', 'borrow', 'slogan', 'local', 'Christian', 'radio', 'station', 'personally', 'loved', 'movie', 'would', 'highly', 'enthusiastically', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'movies', 'cars', 'matter', 'movies', 'general.Rated', 'GAndy', '~O~']",N/A

Ice Age 2 was a bit of a disappointment, though.] But, I was happy after seeing this one.  I have read other reviews that mention a slight disapproval with how the cars handle some activities without the use of humans(ie. answering the phone and working the gas pumps) and have to agree with them.

I don't know why considering Pixar has a perfect batting average when it comes to making good films. Perhaps it was the unbelievably high amount of negative reviews I was reading about the film. In the end, I think this was a good thing as it allowed me to watch a movie that would surpass my expectations, and I love it when a movie is better than I expect.The first thing you need to know about Cars is that it's an abstract fantasy. Much of the criticism I hear is about how the film's setting doesn't make sense logically. Here we have a world populated by cars which feature accomodations such as doors and seats for humans that don't exist. I find this a silly thing to get hung up on as it has no bearing on the story of the film which uses personified cars as clever characterizations of people.The film opens up strong and engages you right from the beginning. I hate NASCAR, but I had no problem enjoying the visuals of the film's openning race that would serve to tell the motive of the main character, Lightning McQueen, as well as set up the conflict he would have to overcome.The story itself is completely unoriginal and full of cliche, but this does not detract much from the film. Even if feel at points that you've been there, seen that, you really haven't due to the interesting twist of the movie's unique setting (cars instead of people in case you haven't been following along). You also haven't seen this story (Doc Hollywood) done so well. Were this a serious drama, the cliche and stereotypes that are rampant in the film would be a negative, but as a comedy they only add to the film's characterization of Americana and society.The pleasure in this film isn't wondering what's going to happen next. In deed, the film is entirely predictable, but fitting to the theme of the movie it's a great ride. Lightning McQueen starts off as a hot shot racing car celebrity who ends up trapped in a small town and ends up learning what's important in life. The pleasure is in watching the growth and development of the main character on his journey to enlightenment (read: not being a self-centered, egotistical moron) and all the encounters with the story's other denizens along the way.Much like Ellen Degeneres did in Finding Nemo, Larry the Cable Guy steals the show as the lovable tow truck named Mater. You don't have to be a fan to appreciate his performance. And Luke Wilson has become a master at making the unlikable-ignorant-jerk likable.I'm not sure how much children will enjoy this film. It's slow in parts much like The Incredibles was, but unlike that film it doesn't have the big action scenes as pay off. The film is definately good for kids and teaches morals such as 'it's not whether you win or lose but how you play that matters.' However, the overall story seems more aimed at adults.

634283,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JNS0,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[3, 3]","Pixar has proven its animation metal a few times. FINDING NEMO and THE INCREDIBLES are their most notable achievements, pulling off excellent scripts mixed with fun animation and great star-power voices.But the one thing that animation studios (including Pixar) have trouble with is displaying human beings within their animation. Many times they look plastic or stilted. The Incredibles avoided this by harkening back to animations-of-ol' but applying new styles. Finding Nemo didn't have many human faces so it wasn't such a hurdle. With CARS, Pixar did something very wise: they didn't show a single human face. Personalities were under the hood (so to speak) of the automobiles which juxtaposed nicely with their humanity.The story follows a cocky up-and-coming race car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson, WEDDING CRASHERS) who's triple tie win forces a showdown in California where the three would-be winners will face off. Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton, FIRST DAUGHTER) and The King (racing icon Richard Petty) are the other two contestants and they make it to California without any problems. They are ready to win ""The Piston Cup."" But Lightning's driver Mack (John Ratzenberger, CHEERS TV series) falls asleep on the road and Lightning slides out the back (also while asleep) while on ""the highway."" Lightning soon wakes up and tries to find Mack, but stumbles upon a one-cylinder town along abandoned Route 66 called Radiator Springs. Unfortunately, Lightning also tears up the town's road and must do his civic duty by pulling the paving machine for the length of the city. Stuck without any resources, Lightning grudgingly does the job, but not before learning to slow his rpm's and smell the proverbial roses. He meets up with Radiator Spring's city attorney Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt, MONSTERS, INC.), a sexy little Porsche model whom he finds himself oddly attracted to. There's also Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, THE STING) the town's physician/judge who harbors a big secret; Ramone (Cheech Marin, TIN CUP), a low-riding, paint-shop owner; Luigi (Tony Shalhoub, GALAXY QUEST), a tire store proprietor with a love of Italian cars; and, of course, Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), the rusted out but trustworthy tow truck who adds the most hilarity to the film.Cars gushes with family friendly messages but no one should hold that against it. Animation features, by their very nature, are directed toward younger audiences and allowing that innocence to come out in Cars is pulled off well without becoming achingly super-sweet. But we've also learned that adults enjoy these movies and Cars does an admirable job of entertaining them, too. Most kids probably won't know what cow-tipping is, so might not understand the slow natured tractors that double as cattle and are tipped over by Mater and Lightning. But adults with experience in this area will probably laugh themselves silly.That there are no human faces in Cars also aided it immensely.

Since I like to follow the races myself, I chose to watch it too. Besides being an enjoyable movie on the surface, it's a movie with a message that can teach the value of teamwork vs. trying to go it alone--something all of us need to learn while we are young. It's the kind of movie that deserves repeated watching.I have read a number of books on leadership this year. I'll just mention one that speaks about teamwork,The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Unabridged on 5 CDs [5 Dysfunctions], a ""leadership fable"" that focuses on the characteristics directly opposed to the building blocks which the author claims are essential for teamwork to develop. These five dysfunctions are absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results.You can see some of this at work in this movie. I believe you can see also the reversal of some form of these at work as the movie progresses. You see that it takes the development of interpersonal relationships and personal goals to overcome obstacles that are necessary to make teams work--to make us team players. These are not insignificant qualities for our children to acquire. We all want them to be successful. These are not trivialized by successful persons. A great plus is: it's all presented in an understandable format within the context of something that is simply good entertainment enjoyed by many of us.Very enjoyable and instructional!",5,Favorite of Children.

634287,AWNKEM8DAG8PY,B00005JNS0,Brian Conway,"[1, 2]","The seventh film from the incredible collaboration between Disney and Pixar, Cars is probably the most mixed and formulaic movie of the bunch. That's not to say the movie isn't good. The premise, a world populated with anthropomorphic cars &agrave; la every single Disney movie ever, is admittedly prosaic but Lasseter and co. know how to milk that formula like nobody else. Cars serves as further proof of this as the film has got it where it really counts. Though the characters and the coming-of-age tale are about as traditional as it gets, Pixar again picks the perfect talents to breathe life into their CG creations. Everyone is appropriately charismatic, tough, melancholy, or goofy with Owen Wilson and Larry The Cable Guy leading the way. Visually, Cars is absolutely stunning, topping all of Pixar's previous efforts. Sometimes the gorgeous vistas are almost too good; one can easily find themself admiring the scenery instead of paying attention to the story but the quick pace manages to reel the film's audience back in quickly enough. The only quality of Cars that is worthy of being deemed ""bad"" is the soundtrack; no matter how hand-in-hand country and Nascar go, bad music is still bad music (which would have been easily fixed if only Randy Newman sang the tunes). While not as revolutionary as Toy Story, heart-warming as Finding Nemo, or brilliant as The Incredibles, Cars manages to generate enough smiles and heart-felt moments to allow it a place on the shelf next to the rest of the Disney/Pixar gems.",4,Cars (3.5 stars),1165276800,"12 5, 2006",2006,1526,"['seventh', 'film', 'incredible', 'collaboration', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'Cars', 'probably', 'most', 'mixed', 'formulaic', 'movie', 'bunch', 'not', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'good', 'premise', 'world', 'populated', 'anthropomorphic', 'cars', 'agrave', 'single', 'Disney', 'movie', 'ever', 'admittedly', 'prosaic', 'Lasseter', 'co.', 'know', 'how', 'milk', 'formula', 'nobody', 'else', 'Cars', 'further', 'proof', 'film', 'got', 'where', 'really', 'characters', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', 'are', 'as', 'traditional', 'Pixar', 'again', 'perfect', 'talents', 'breathe', 'life', 'CG', 'creations', 'Everyone', 'appropriately', 'charismatic', 'tough', 'melancholy', 'goofy', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'leading', 'way', 'Visually', 'Cars', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'topping', 'Pixar', 'previous', 'efforts', 'Sometimes', 'gorgeous', 'vistas', 'are', 'almost', 'too', 'good', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'find', 'themself', 'admiring', 'scenery', 'instead', 'paying', 'attention', 'story', 'quick', 'pace', 'manages', 'reel', 'film', 'audience', 'back', 'quickly', 'enough', 'only', 'quality', 'Cars', 'worthy', 'being', 'deemed', 'bad', 'soundtrack', 'matter', 'how', 'hand-in-hand', 'country', 'Nascar', 'go', 'bad', 'music', 'still', 'bad', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easily', 'fixed', 'only', 'Randy', 'Newman', 'sang', 'tunes', 'not', 'as', 'revolutionary', 'Toy', 'Story', 'heart-warming', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'brilliant', 'Incredibles', 'Cars', 'generate', 'enough', 'smiles', 'heart-felt', 'moments', 'allow', 'place', 'shelf', 'rest', 'Disney/Pixar', 'gems']",N/A

634293,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00005JNS0,Caleb Williams,"[2, 2]","Cars was the 7th feature film created by Pixar studios and it kept up the trend of excellent Pixar productions. Managing to win Pixar its 3rd consecutive best Animated Feature Academy award, there was no denying how good this film was. The story is clich&eacute; but the concept is still as fresh as Toy Story was back in the day. Its colourful and detailed environments, cars and sequences are put together brilliantly. Pixar makes its movies with this confidence in their own abilities. They seem to never doubt their animation skills or their general imagination for a unique and awe inspiring story.I mentioned that the story is clich&eacute; so I guess I should explain what I mean when I say that. Most Disney movies tend to be along the same lines with a main character who tends to be quite narrow minded and through a series of enlightening events manages to become open minded and a nice person. There's nothing wrong with that, after all it's good to teach our kids that we should all be open minded and nice people. If that's portrayed by a jealous toy or an overprotective fish then so be it. With that clich&eacute; plot device, Pixar still manages to create a unique film and a brilliantly funny in between to give us a hell of a lot of enjoyment.Cars focuses around stock car race car Lightning McQueen who's a racing champion and a sure fire shot at winning the prestigious Piston Cup. During the final race of the Piston Cup championship, a series of events lead to him and two other cars being tied in a photo finish. Because of this situation it is decided that the three will take part in a one off race to decide the true champion. Whilst being transported by Mack to California, McQueen rolls out the back of the truck while asleep and ends up lost in a small town known as Radiator Springs. McQueen accidentally damages the road in Radiator Springs and is forced by the towns Judge, Doc to stay until he fixes the road. While McQueen is in town he makes friends with a truck named Mater, who isn't the brightest bulb in the street. He also seems to develop a crush on another car known as Sally who's a porsche 911 Carrera.I wont tell you more about the story as it will essentially ruin the movie for you. The whole movie is just amazing and although I was disappointed with their follow up of Ratatouille, Pixar really made me a dedicated fan with this. I would strongly recommend this to any fans of their past movies or just to fans of movies in general as it's just overly entertaining and quite loveable.",5,An Interesting Concept And A Brilliant Movie By Pixar,1219190400,"08 20, 2008",2008,2534,"['Cars', 'was', '7th', 'feature', 'film', 'created', 'Pixar', 'studios', 'kept', 'up', 'trend', 'excellent', 'Pixar', 'productions', 'Managing', 'win', 'Pixar', '3rd', 'consecutive', 'best', 'Animated', 'Feature', 'Academy', 'award', 'was', 'denying', 'how', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'story', 'clich', 'eacute', 'concept', 'still', 'as', 'fresh', 'Toy', 'Story', 'was', 'back', 'day', 'colourful', 'detailed', 'environments', 'cars', 'sequences', 'are', 'put', 'together', 'brilliantly', 'Pixar', 'movies', 'confidence', 'own', 'abilities', 'seem', 'never', 'doubt', 'animation', 'skills', 'general', 'imagination', 'unique', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'story.I', 'mentioned', 'story', 'clich', 'eacute', 'guess', 'should', 'explain', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'say', 'Most', 'Disney', 'movies', 'tend', 'be', 'same', 'lines', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'be', 'quite', 'narrow', 'minded', 'series', 'enlightening', 'events', 'become', 'open', 'minded', 'nice', 'person', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'good', 'teach', 'kids', 'should', 'be', 'open', 'minded', 'nice', 'people', 'portrayed', 'jealous', 'toy', 'overprotective', 'fish', 'then', 'so', 'be', 'clich', 'eacute', 'plot', 'device', 'Pixar', 'still', 'create', 'unique', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'give', 'hell', 'lot', 'enjoyment.Cars', 'stock', 'car', 'race', 'car', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'who', 'racing', 'champion', 'sure', 'fire', 'shot', 'winning', 'prestigious', 'Piston', 'Cup', 'final', 'race', 'Piston', 'Cup', 'championship', 'series', 'events', 'lead', 'two', 'other', 'cars', 'being', 'tied', 'photo', 'finish', 'situation', 'decided', 'three', 'will', 'take', 'part', 'one', 'off', 'race', 'decide', 'true', 'champion', 'Whilst', 'being', 'transported', 'Mack', 'California', 'McQueen', 'out', 'back', 'truck', 'asleep', 'up', 'lost', 'small', 'town', 'known', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'McQueen', 'accidentally', 'damages', 'road', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'forced', 'towns', 'Judge', 'Doc', 'stay', 'road', 'McQueen', 'town', 'friends', 'truck', 'named', 'Mater', 'who', ""n't"", 'brightest', 'bulb', 'street', 'also', 'develop', 'crush', 'car', 'known', 'Sally', 'who', 'porsche', '911', 'Carrera.I', 'wont', 'tell', 'more', 'story', 'will', 'essentially', 'ruin', 'movie', 'whole', 'movie', 'just', 'amazing', 'was', 'disappointed', 'follow', 'Ratatouille', 'Pixar', 'really', 'made', 'dedicated', 'fan', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'past', 'movies', 'just', 'fans', 'movies', 'general', 'just', 'overly', 'entertaining', 'quite', 'loveable']",N/A

634304,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JNS0,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 2]","For ""Cars,"" the folks at Disney/Pixar created a world in which automobiles replace every other being on Earth. I found this fascinating and baffling at the same time; they drive on roads and highways as they usually would, but they also have the ability to enter buildings, hold cameras, and sit in stadiums like humans. Obviously, this means that they take on human professions; at one point, a Porche named Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) says that she used to be a lawyer in Los Angeles. Interestingly, cars also take on the role of other life forms, including insects (which are appropriately reinterpreted as miniature Volkswagen Beetles with wings) and livestock (replaced by tractors).But all this is to be expected in an animated film, and in this case, it works even better because the story enables viewers to forget about such unrealistic things. This is a good thing for audiences of any age. For kids, ""Cars"" is a cute, well-crafted film with loveable characters. For adults, it's an entertaining animated comedy that manages to be humorous and insightful without getting sickly sweet.True to the tradition of family friendly Disney films, this is the story of friendship, learning, and redemption, and it offers an important life lesson while maintaining a comedic disposition. One would think that such a formulaic plot would have gotten stale a long time ago, but for whatever reason, it still works. There are probably many reasons for this (not the least of which is the appeal it has for children). The one I stick to is that, no matter how inaccurate, sappy, or unoriginal a story may seem, everyone loves something with a good heart that can deliver a happy ending. ""Cars"" is certainly not new in terms of its basic structure or characterizations, but the fact that it literally brings mute and/or inanimate objects to life makes it fun. Pixar is a studio that has proven itself capable of such a task, starting in 1995 with talking toys and continuing in 1998 and 2003 with talking bugs and talking fish.Now we have talking cars, and no one seems to like talking more than Lightening McQueen (Owen Wilson), especially if it's in front of a camera. Lightening is a rookie racecar, but he already has a following that outshines most other celebrities of the racing scene. One particular race results in a three-way tie between him, the mean spirited Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), and the competitive but decent King (Richard Petty). In order to break the tie, one more race will be held in California. The winner will receive the prestigious Piston Cup, the fictitious equivalent of the Heisman Trophy or the Stanley Cup. Lightening wants to win with every fiber of his being, not only because he believes it'll turn him into a bigger celebrity, but also because he'll become the new face of a well known car company (he wants to get out of his current sponsorship: a car wax called Rust-eze).Unfortunately, things are about to get bumpy for Lightening. Even though he's popular, skilled, and photogenic, he's also an arrogant publicity hound. Because he believes he's such a hotshot, he feels he has the right to pressure others into doing what they shouldn't. On the way to California, his mode of transportation--a big rig named Mack (John Ratzenberger)--falls asleep on the road (a situation which isn't helped by a group of neon lighted punk hotrods). This causes the rear hatch to open and Lightening to be dumped off the side of the road. His attempt to find Mack leads him to the famous Route 66. It also leads to a high-speed chase with an irritable, aging police car (Michael Wallis as Sheriff). Not surprisingly, Lightening is caught and arrested.Thus begins his stay in Radiator Springs, a remote, dilapidated desert town. It has definitely seen better days: buildings have chipped paint and rotting wood; the neon signs are faded and buzzing; and the only intersection with a traffic light is useless because yellow is the only one that seems to work properly. It's filled with a variety of colorful characters, all of which are somewhat odd but completely good. There's Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), a hillbilly tow truck; Ramone (Cheech Marin), a vintage car that loves to change his paint job every day; his wife, Flo (Jenifer Lewis); Filmore (George Carlin), a wasted Volkswagen van whose mind is still stuck in the sixties; the hippie-hater Sarge (Paul Dooley); the Italian tire duo of Luigi (Tony Shalhoub) and Guido (Guido Quaroni); the shy fire truck, Red (Joe Ranft), and Sally, the attorney Porche who left the city life of Los Angeles for the freedom of the open road.The most important character of this group is Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), a character who ultimately takes on the role of the Wise Old Man. He also seems bitter and short fused, especially around Lightening, whose desperation to reach California in time has made him immature and shallow (little does he know that his disappearance has become major news). He's ordered to tow a road-paving machine in order to fix the damage he caused during the high-speed chase, something he's unwilling to participate in. But it eventually becomes clear he's learning a very important lesson: if he wants to achieve his goals, he has to understand the value of thinking of others, not just himself. The relationship he and Doc share is an interesting one: as it turns out, Lightening can actually teach Doc a valuable lesson, one that specifically relates to letting go of the past.But other characters also need to learn a thing or two, as well. What the locals want is for someone to drive through their city and make use of their services. In other words: they want to revive their home through business and companionship. Ever since a new highway was built out of convenience, Radiator Springs has been all but forgotten. No one is more dedicated to the welfare of the little town than Sally, and eventually, Lightening begins to notice. This in turn reawakens feelings within him, feelings of affection and admiration. They also bring about compassionate feelings that make him see the townsfolk in a new light. They're a good group of people (actually, they're automobiles), and they deserve to be treated with respect. But the question remains: will he learn his lesson before he's found and taken to the big race?I suppose it's unimportant to answer that question. ""Cars"" is not about telling a new story; it's about telling an old story in a new way, and that's what makes it such a fun experience. What most impressed me was how the world we all know is adapted to serve the needs of living, breathing cars. Even the scenery takes on a particularly vehicular quality; many of the desert rock formations resemble the shapes of cars, hood ornaments, and hubcaps. I was also impressed by many of the vocal talent the filmmakers assembled. Only Larry the Cable Guy could voice a rusty tow truck with a thick southern accent (they even work in his trademark phrases, ""Git-r-done!"" and, ""I don't care who you are: that's funny right there!""). Only George Carlin could voice a character that sells ""organic"" gasoline and blares a Jimi Hendrix record in the morning (he seemed to rely on Al Sleezy, the Hippy Dippy Weather Man for this role). All the elements came together to form a decent addition to the Disney/Pixar lineup, a film perfect for kids and adults alike.",4,Get Your Motor Running,1149897600,"06 10, 2006",2006,7362,"['Cars',

634308,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JNS0,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 1]","Even in the teaser trailer phase of a film's release, many people were not anticipating Cars that much. Was it because they had come off the action-packed the Incredibles and people weren't exactly revving (pun maybe intended) for talking cars? Or was it just simply the idea seemed weird? Whatever the case, the general reaction upon its release was it was good-but-not-great; the one that ruined Pixar's 6 for 6 winning streak. So is it that bad? Well no, but the idea this is a horrible film is just really pushing it but it's still a lesser effort.In a world where everyone and everything's car-related, the story centers on Lightning McQueen, a hotshot racer who only thinks of himself. After a 3-way tie for the Piston Cup and on route to California for the finals, he's accidentally dumped on the Interstate and ends up in a small town called Radiator Springs. There, he meets a number of cars trying to keep their struggling town alive while Lightning learns it's better to think of more things than winning.Let's get the good stuff out of the way. While everyone sings 3D animation praises, a slight backlash was created when Disney at one point abandoned traditional 2D thanks to the failures of Home on the Range and Brother Bear, making audiences hate 3D a bit since more and more (and more) 3D movies were being released. But still, the computer animators outdid themselves since almost every new camera angle gives us something to marvel; from the neon lights to the sheen of polished cars to the landscape. It's also a bit more movie-esque in the more bigger action scenes, making it a bit more dynamic. There's also some inspired gags like bugs that are actually Bugs as in Volkswagon Beetles while cow-tipping as been replaced by tractor tipping.In a couple of commentaries, Pixar head John Lasseter said that a goal of Pixar was to make you see familiar worlds in a new light. Imagine toys that can talk, monsters having feelings or the burdens of being a superhero. Does anybody really wonder what a car does? While that's not to say the idea at least sounds pretty neat but it just seems awkward that we have to get sympathetic to a talking car. While I'm not being kind of pessimistic and it's unfair to say every Pixar film has to be at least masterpiece-level or it's awful, you can admit at least there's some problems with the film anyway.One problem is the story. It's weird how there's as much as 6 people who work on the screenplay yet it feels so padded in its story. There's a whole lot of scenes that are meant to develop everyone but everyone seems kind of one-dimensional anyway and main hero Lightning just sounds like a jerk all the way through even with a newer enlightenment (could be a Owen Wilson problem though). The James Taylor ""Our Town"" song is meant to be the emotional scene but it pales to the Sarah McLachlan-sung ""Jessie's story"" scene in Toy Story 2. The voice acting is a bit more stunt casting, probably catching it from Dreamworks' tendency to get big-name stars to voice everyone.Pixar was excellent when it came down to DVD's packed with information about making the film. Sure A Bug's Life and the Toy Story films started out kind of thin but when Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and the Incredibles had top-tier DVD's, seeing Cars quite small extras is disappointing. We get the kinda-funny short One Man Band while a new short involving the tow-truck Mater is not that funny. Everything else is light on insight and you'll instantly think of a double-dip in its future. But strangely, I ended up buying it anyway knowing there was a bigger release somewhere in the future. It'll probably come around Ratatouille's DVD release (which, by the way, looks quite promising).I don't love the movie yet I don't outright hate it and I won't hold Pixar's past achievements against it but based on the film alone, it is a bit disappointing there's just some issues that the film has you wish were fixed.",4,Halfway between great and okay,1173484800,"03 10, 2007",2007,3946,"['Even', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'phase', 'film', 'release', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'not', 'anticipating', 'Cars', 'much', 'Was', 'had', 'come', 'off', 'action-packed', 'Incredibles', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'revving', 'pun', 'maybe', 'intended', 'talking', 'cars', 'was', 'just', 'simply', 'idea', 'seemed', 'weird', 'Whatever', 'case', 'general', 'reaction', 'release', 'was', 'was', 'good-but-not-great', 'one', 'ruined', 'Pixar', '6', '6', 'winning', 'streak', 'bad', 'Well', 'no', 'idea', 'horrible', 'film', 'just', 'really', 'pushing', 'still', 'lesser', 'effort.In', 'world', 'where', 'everyone', 'everything', 'car-related', 'story', 'centers', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'hotshot', 'racer', 'who', 'only', '3-way', 'tie', 'Piston', 'Cup', 'route', 'California', 'finals', 'accidentally', 'dumped', 'Interstate', 'up', 'small', 'town', 'called', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'number', 'cars', 'trying', 'keep', 'struggling', 'town', 'alive', 'Lightning', 'better', 'think', 'more', 'things', 'winning.Let', 'get', 'good', 'stuff', 'way', 'everyone', 'sings', '3D', 'animation', 'praises', 'slight', 'backlash', 'was', 'created', 'when', 'Disney', 'one', 'point', 'abandoned', 'traditional', '2D', 'thanks', 'failures', 'Home', 'Range', 'Brother', 'Bear', 'making', 'audiences', 'hate', '3D', 'bit', 'more', 'more', 'more', '3D', 'movies', 'were', 'being', 'released', 'still', 'computer', 'animators', 'outdid', 'almost', 'new', 'camera', 'angle', 'something', 'marvel', 'neon', 'lights', 'sheen', 'polished', 'cars', 'landscape', 'also', 'bit', 'more', 'movie-esque', 'more', 'bigger', 'action', 'scenes', 'making', 'bit', 'more', 'dynamic', 'also', 'inspired', 'gags', 'bugs', 'are', 'actually', 'Bugs', 'Volkswagon', 'Beetles', 'cow-tipping', 'been', 'replaced', 'tractor', 'tipping.In', 'couple', 'commentaries', 'Pixar', 'head', 'John', 'Lasseter', 'said', 'goal', 'Pixar', 'was', 'make', 'see', 'familiar', 'worlds', 'new', 'light', 'Imagine', 'can', 'talk', 'monsters', 'having', 'feelings', 'burdens', 'being', 'superhero', 'anybody', 'really', 'wonder', 'what', 'car', 'not', 'say', 'idea', 'least', 'sounds', 'pretty', 'neat', 'just', 'awkward', 'have', 'get', 'sympathetic', 'talking', 'car', ""'m"", 'not', 'being', 'kind', 'pessimistic', 'unfair', 'say', 'Pixar', 'film', 'be', 'least', 'masterpiece-level', 'awful', 'can', 'admit', 'least', 'problems', 'film', 'anyway.One', 'problem', 'story', 'weird', 'how', 'as', 'much', '6', 'people', 'who', 'work', 'screenplay', 'yet', 'so', 'padded', 'story', 'whole', 'lot', 'scenes', 'are', 'meant', 'develop', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'kind', 'one-dimensional', 'anyway', 'main', 'hero', 'Lightning', 'just', 'jerk', 'way', 'even', 'newer', 'enlightenment', 'could', 'be', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'problem', 'James', 'Taylor', 'Town', 'song', 'meant', 'be', 'emotional', 'scene', 'Sarah', 'McLachlan-sung', 'Jessie', 'story', 'scene', 'Toy', 'Story', '2', 'voice', 'acting', 'bit', 'more', 'stunt', 'casting', 'probably', 'catching', 'Dreamworks', 'tendency', 'get', 'big-name', 'stars', 'voice', 'everyone.Pixar', 'was', 'excellent', 'when', 'came', 'down', 'DVD', 'packed', 'information', 'making', 'film', 'Sure', 'Bug', 'Life', 'Toy', 'Story', 'films', 'started', 'out', 'kind', 'thin', 'when', 'Monsters', 'Inc', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'Incredibles', 'had', 'top-tier', 'DVD', 'seeing', 'Cars', 'quite', 'small', 'extras', 'disappointing', 'get', 'kinda-funny', 'short', 'One', 'Man', 'Band', 'new', 'short', 'involving', 'tow-truck', 'Mater', 'not', 'funny', 'Everything', 'else', 'light', 'insight', ""'ll"", 'instantly', 'think', 'double-dip', 'future', 'strangely', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', 'anyway', 'knowing', 'there', 'was', 'bigger', 'release', 'somewhere', 'future', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'come', 'Ratatouille', 'DVD', 'release', 'way', 'quite', 'promising', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'movie', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'outright', 'hate', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hold', 'Pixar', 'past', 'achievements', 'based', 'film', 'alone', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'just', 'issues', 'film', 'wish', 'were', 'fixed']",N/A

Cars, which skirts dangerously close to the 2-hour mark, is simply too long for a kids movie.  Yes, I know the Roger Ebert maxim, ""No good film is too long, no bad film is too short"", but my young son gets bored at the 80 minute mark, especially since the hero has been stuck in first gear for the last 60 minutes.The story: hotshot Rookie Owen Wilson ... er, Lightning McQueen finishes his first season in the Piston Cup circuit in a 3-way points tie with veterens The King and Chick Hicks.  It is decided to have a race-off between the three cars to determine who should win the prestigious Cup.  Off the three cars head to Los Angeles, but Lightning manages to get lost and arrested in Radiator Springs - a one-stoplight town on Route 66, bypassed by the Interstate system and forgotten.  The town's grizzled doctor and circuit judge makes Lightning repair the road he tore up.  As he works in the town, Lightning learns a little about humility, a little about love, and a lot about life.The opening NASCAR-esque race sequence is by far the highlight of the film for me (and for my son).  The power, the speed, and the sounds of a day at the race track are lovingly reproduced, and even a non-racing fan like myself finds the sequence amazing.  Unfortunately, the middle slows down to a crawl and lasts about 30 minutes too long.  I think the problem is that the creators gave equal time to Lightning's three new relationships in the town - with Mater, the wise-cracking tow truck; with Sally, the big-city Porsche who wanted a slower life; and with Doc (voiced by the late great Paul Newman), the old-timer with a secret.  The film should have been a double-redemption story: Lightning learning what life's all about, while in parallel Doc faces his past and overcomes his bitterness.  If the filmakers had more clearly focussed on this story, and allowed the other two plotlines to recede to subplots, the film would have been focussed and more enjoyable (not to mention cheaper to make!).So the film only rates a 3/4 for me.  The other star is lost because this DVD edition is not up to the standards of other Pixar and John Lassiter offerings.  While there are some nifty little vignettes on Route 66, NASCAR racing, etc., they are just that: little.

634316,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00005JNS0,Craig Matteson,"[2, 3]","Well, maybe something got past me because I am not a NASCAR devotee, but this one seemed pretty much an ordinary ""fish out of water"" story with few twists or turns or delights.  It isn't that it is bad.  In fact, it is even enjoyable to watch with kids.  However, it just didn't have any ""wow"" factor.The look is pretty good and some of the cars are even dazzling (if preposterous) to look at.  However, the story of the selfish young hotshot having to basically lose it all, but then learning about friends who pull him through is quite old.  It is a useful story for kids to learn (and adults who didn't learn the lesson as kids), but somehow I wanted Pixar magic to kick it into overdrive - to use some Nitro.  But it just sort of plodded along.The voices were all good.  Why Paul Newman is there becomes clear in the second half of the movie.  Owen Wilson puts in the right amount of ego with enough humanity to learn as the star ""Lightning McQueen"" (will that name seem cool to anyone who doesn't know Steve McQueen?  McQueen???).  Bonny Hunt is good as Sally Carrera.  And Tony Shaloub and Cheech Martin are fine color characters.  Especially fine, I would say.But do we really need Larry the Cable Guy as Tow Mater?  Isn't that awfully - well, awful?  It isn't that I hated them going out tractor tipping, or Mater showing McQueen some moves that McQueen didn't understand, but a buck toothed hick?  Who thought that was witty?  Let them know it wasn't.The bit with John Ratzenberger over the credits was quite well done and shows the kind of sparkle that I wish had been in the rest of the movie.Still, a pretty good movie.

What this means is that this is a well-made, incredibly visualized film with a good story, strong characters, and a plot moral to make you feel things both during and after the film is done. While this film may not be quite as strong as others in the Pixar canon, it stands up quite well on its own. The basic line of the story is to take the time in life to realize what's really important in life. To not go-go-go at breakneck speed at all times, or you'll miss out on so much that life has to offer. A big parallel is drawn between the Interstate, and the more winding Route 66. We race through life on the Interstate, when we could take the scenic route on an old winding road and see and learn so much more, about ourselves and life in general. One thing I really enjoyed in this film was the strong sense of nostalgia it evoked. So many towns withered and died when their access roads suddenly were cut off by new highways. Many just didn't make it when the travelers stopped coming through, and by the magic of film, we're presented with one that almost completely dies, then comes back to life. As is usual for Pixar, the voice-over work is inspired, with many Pixar-veterans at work again here. The sound is wonderful, with the roar of a full-scale race doing laps through my surround-sound system. The picture quality is exceptional, the cars here gleam like I wish mine did! Oh well, that's the magic of movies! This fine film keeps Pixar's winning streak rolling on, what is it now, seven straight hits with no bombs anywhere?

634336,A2VN15501IUTND,B00005JNS0,"D. Christensen ""Jesus Freak""","[0, 0]","Cars is another winner from the combined efforts of Disney and Pixar. Anyone who watches this movie will be able to relate to a character, from the spiteful Hudson Hornet/Doc Hudson to the easygoing Mater. A star studded cast of voice actors gives this film recognizable voices for anyone. Some of the actors are: Paul Newman (one of my favorites in this film), Owen Wilson (Marley and Me, Drillbit Taylor, Night at The Museum), Larry the Cable Guy, (another one of my favorites) and John Ratzenberger, who has appeared in all the Pixar film and plays his most prominent role in this one. The general gist of the movie is a stuck-up rookie racecar, namely Lightning McQueen, getting arrested in a small Route 66 town called Radiator Springs, where life is mostly about trying to passing through tourist to buy something from one of the characters stores. Over the course of the movie, you find that the town doctor was the best racecar around in his younger days, but had a big crash that ended his career. He know does not want anything to do with the racecar that comes to town. McQueen learns the importance of slowing down and enjoying the ride on the Highway of Life. He helps everyone in the town, and even restores the 60's neon lights in the town. Also, he falls in love with the town attorney, a 911 Porsche. But the best part is the end, when McQueen has a chance to win the Piston Cup, but instead helps one of the greats (called ""The King"" in the movie and modeled after Richard Petty's Plymouth Firebird and voiced by Petty himself) finish his final race. This movie has the best moral of any of the Pixar movies. An added bonus is all the retro cars, from a Model T to a 50's Chevy Impala. Plus there are some great punch lines as with all the Pixar movies. I've saved the best part of this movie for last. The soundtrack is simply awesome. Featuring Rascall Flatts, Sheryl Crow, and Brad Paisley, I would rate it as one notch below the soundtrack ofRocky IV, which has the best soundtrack of all time. Overall this is a phenomenal film.

Vibrant colors, more detail and overall, a beautiful video transfer with no blemishes, compression artifacts whatsoever.Audio is presented in English 5.1 (uncompressed, 48 kHz/24-Bit) and the racing segments really utilize the surround channels but also the LFE.

Crashes bring out the booms and the audience on the race track can be heard on the surround channels. Overall, a solid lossless audio soundtrack!Subtitles are in English SDH.As for the DVD, the DVD is featured in widescreen (2:39:1) and is enhanced for 169 televisions.

The picture and audio quality of ""Cars"" in High Definition is still magnificent but of course since the original Blu-ray was released in 2007, the lossless audio soundtrack is presented in English 5.1 uncompressed (48 kHz/24-Bit) instead of the current 5.1 or 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtrack that Pixar films are offered in today's Blu-ray releases.  But still, it's uncompressed audio and the lossless audio soundtrack of this Blu-ray release is still fantastic.  And of course, picture quality is still outstanding.As for the ""Ultimate Cars Gift Pack"", the release is right on time for the holidays.  With many people now moving to Blu-ray and many Disney/Pixar fans knowing that ""Cars"" is one of those must-have films to own, Disney is offering a gift pack that includes a DVD (which is great for the kids during long commutes) and two exclusive cars with custom Ransburg paint.Really, there's nothing negative that can be said about ""Cars - Ultimate Cars Gift Pack"".  If you have know someone who is new to Blu-ray and is a Disney/Pixar fan, this is a wonderful holiday gift to give.

Little Lightning McQueen (better known as ""Stickers"" by his love interest due to the sponsor ship logos all over him) is a hotshot race car who becomes lost and stuck in a small po-dunk town somewhere in the Southwest Desert (New Mexico? Arizona? Who knows...). He has to learn humility and what selflessness really is before he can get back on track (yeah, yeah pun intended).The movie's cute. Yes, cute.

It is head-and-shoulders above _Happy Feet_ in all respects: The animation is better, the storyline is vastly better, and it's much less crude.  However, unlike _Happy Feet_, it's not a movie that does all the entertaining for you with cheap laughs; you have to pay attention.I must confess that I thought the story line needed a bit of editing (was not as well-paced as the Toy Story movies), but it wasn't glaring.  The other downside is that this is not really a kids' movie.  The action is much too fast and the bulk of the humor is in cultural references and comparatively sophisticated sight gags, most of which will go right over the heads of children (and, I guess, of some adults, hence the criticism that it is ""tedious"").  It's an extraordinarily clever movie and can be watched several times before one catches all the little gags.On the up side:1) It lacks most of the toilet humor and thinly-disguised sexual references to which Disney seems to be resorting more and more.2) The animation is mind-boggling.  Some of the scenery doesn't even look like animation, and the nuances of automotive movement (shaking smokestacks, etc.) are dead-on.  Makes _Happy Feet_ look mediocre and _Toy Story_ look like stick figures.  Absolutely a visually gorgeous movie.3) The story line, while a bit uneven, is still better than the vast majority of animated features.4) For those old enough to ""get"" them, the celebrity cameos, identifiable cars, historical references, and Americana references are priceless.

Only after it came out on DVD, I begin to truly appreciate what John Lasseter was trying to do with this movie.It took me a while to understand what the true meaning of this movie is.  As I get older, I understand the 'slow down and enjoy how you got there' meaning to this movie.  This movie is more than it appears on the surface.  Watching it numerous times on DVD has helped to fully understand it.Another point that I have discovered with Mr. Lasseter's reason for making this movie is an appreciation for Route 66.  I started doing a Google search on Route 66.  There are a number of web sites dedicated to it.  Since I already love nostaglia, I have really enjoyed watching the movie and then looking at websites that have the locations that the movie was patterned after.  For example, look up the Wigwam Motel to see where the idea for the Cozy Cone Motel came from.As for the movie, the characters are great.  The voice overs were all great choices.  Owen Wilson is Lightning.  Paul Newman is Doc Hudson.  They fit their parts perfectly.  The soundtrack is to be enjoyed.  The 'Get your Kicks on Route 66' is great.

It was positive but not as positive as previous Pixar films have been met. Still, Cars is a really good movie with great animation, voice cast, characters and a good story. I've never been interested in the world of racing but when I saw Cars in theaters, I realize it was not only for racing fans. It has a wide appeal and I really enjoyed it. Lightning McQueen is a very well-rounded character and you can see his transformation from selfish moron to a caring and loyal friend. The story has really good messages and as with every Pixar film, the animation and the level of detail is simply breathtaking.Cars may not be your cup of tea but is a worthwile picture and I think it deserved the Best Animated Feature Oscar instead of Happy Feet which may be good but not as good at this one. Cars may be seen like the worst Pixar production but even worst Pixar means amazing and much much better than all the competition has to offer. Cars is an excellent film.Video & Audio:Cars arrived on Blu-ray on 2007 in a single-disc package. Now Disney has repackaged it alongside a DVD in order to promote the sequel that will premiere this summer in theaters. Cars BD is magnificent. You can watch every detail, every nuance, every texture in the screen. No compression artifacts are found in the print. Cars BD is amazing.Likewise, the 5.1 uncompressed Audio is the equivalent of the picture in the sound department. You can hear everything with absolute clarity.Bonus Features:In comparison with other Pixar BD sets, Cars is somewhat light in the bonus features department but still has a lot of insight bonus material.First you have the Cine-explore feature which allows you to see the picture in an interactive way where you can choose between two audiocomentaries (one with John Lasseter and the other with the animators), also this feature enables you to pick some featurettes that will appear from time to time. This mini documentaries include design of characters, settings, graphics, animation and more.  If you prefer you can also watch this documentaries separately. You also have deleted scenes, a game, the shorts One Man's Band and Mater and the Ghostlight, the inspiration for the movie and more.A DVD copy is also offered.Sneak Peeks:Some trailers include:Cars 2 (in theaters June 24)The Lion King: Diamond Edition (on BD and DVD this fall)The Incredibles on BD (already released)Dumbo: 70th Anniversary (on BD and DVD Sep. 20)The Fox and the Hound: 30th Anniversary (on BD and DVD Aug. 9)Closing Thoughts:Cars is an excellent film that is worth watching.

If you didn't catch the movie in theaters, surely you were aware that the movie was out. The branding campaign for this movie was unprecedented it seems with available merchandise ranging from breakfast cereals to children's gym shoes, books, video games, apparel, posters and more.Well if you didn't catch the movie in theaters the good thing is that now you can pick up the DVD. If you did check out the movie this past summer, chances are this is one that you may want to add to your DVD collection.Cars is the story about a red race car named Lightning McQueen. It appears that he is rather new to the championship aspect of racing as he doesn't have the biggest endorsements and he is still chasing the coveted Piston Cup. On his way to the Piston Cup Championship Race, the big rig truck that is carrying him dozes off and McQueen is accidentally ejected from the rig. This leaves McQueen lost in the middle of nowhere. He rips into a really old town named Radiator Springs where he is stranded. The town needs a new road and they enlist McQueen's help. McQueen isn't quite willing to help in the beginning but he soon grows close to the people he meets in town like the rusty pick-up truck Toe-Mater and a pretty blue Porsche named Sally.Cars is a really endearing story and the critics who hail the film as an instant classic are right on the money.

It's even got that one weighty central topic, the moment the entire picture balances upon, when the collective audience presumably takes a sharp breath of air and has some sort of mini-epiphany in connecting it to their own lives. The major pieces are all there, truly, so why didn't I find this picture as rewarding as the rest of the animation house's legendary catalog? It's got something to do with the moments in-between. Usually, it's precisely those instants off the beaten path that Pixar absolutely swallows up, enveloping the screen with tiny jokes, dazzling visual wizardry and deep, circumstantial character development. In Cars, for whatever reason, the power in such moments is lacking. The studio goes through the motions, which makes for a more-than-decent facsimile, but in the end it doesn't feel as complete and engaging as their other masterworks.

You root for him and for Lightning at the end.-  Recent history.  How the Interstates eclipsed towns that they passed by.  The romance of old Route 66, ""the Mother Road.""  The hypnotic lure of Western landscapes - as the heroine fleeing from L.A. says, ""I fell in love."" The film is poetry at times.-  A paean to the Hudson Hornet racecar of the early 1950's.

We can talk about the cliched storyline of the arrogant city slicker driving into an old, beat up town populated with goofy characters all day. It wouldn't matter. The movie is a total cliche, he learns his lessons about life and not being selfish, he wins the affection of the ""girl car"", he inspires the old champion racer to reconnect with the world again, his goofy sidekicks rebuild their town and get back to grooving, whatever... It's not a great story.The story and characters are second rate but the visual quality of this movie on Blu-Ray will make your jaw drop! I watched Ratatouille on Blu-Ray first and was mightily impressed but I knew Cars would take the cake as a demonstration disc on account of Cars being very colorful. It exceeded my expectations.Watch the scene when the main character ""Lighting McQueen"" gets into that transport truck and they drive out of the stadium and across the freeway of the city at night and then across the highways of the Southwest in the day. ""Life is a Highway"" is the musical cue during this scene. The visual scheme is gorgeous, lifelike, 3-Dimensional with an extreme sense of depth perception. It looks like real life even though it's a CGI animated film!I watched Cars using a PS3 connected via a standard HDMI cable to a 42 inch, 1080p LCD TV by LG.

(No Spoilers Included)The open-ended one sentence summary: Selfish racecar gets stranded in a little Route 66 town with a towtruck voiced by Larry the Cable Guy. 'Nuff said.Content Inappropriate for All Ages: 2 mild ""bad words"" refering to a place, and about 5 innuendos, most involving ""nuts"".Characters: 4 of 5 cars. Lots of variety in this department. Most of the characters were believable and acted accordingly, but I didn't care about them as much as I was expecting. First of all, Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) was a riot. Mack the truck had an awfully familiar voice... *wink* and did a good job. The only casting choice I didn't like was Bonnie Hunt as Sally. She sounded too old for the part.Plot: 4 of 5 cars. Starts off with a twist, falls into a pattern for a while, then ends with a twist I didn't even see coming. Comedic bits interspersed. Pretty quality stuff.Animation: 5 of 5 cars. Animation like we've come to expect from Pixar. I'm sure it was hard to animate those cars' faces.Music: 4 of 5 cars. The songs (not original) perfectly capture the essence of the movie. I didn't find the score memorable, though.Impact: 3 of 5 cars. I'd say this is the most important section of the review. I did get involved in this movie when I saw it, but it wasn't a tear-jerker. The big finale didn't leave me with the sense of triumph which was essentially the whole point. I did think about this movie after I saw it, but I wasn't enamoured with it. It didn't leave me with any hard hitting thoughts on its characters, or side splitting lines to quote.All in all, 4 of 5 cars.",4,Review: Cars,1151625600,"06 30, 2006",2006,1657,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Pixar', 'latest', 'movie', 'here', 'review', 'Spoilers', 'Included', 'open-ended', 'one', 'sentence', 'summary', 'Selfish', 'racecar', 'stranded', 'little', 'Route', '66', 'town', 'towtruck', 'voiced', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'said.Content', 'Inappropriate', 'All', 'Ages', '2', 'mild', 'bad', 'words', 'refering', 'place', '5', 'innuendos', 'most', 'involving', 'nuts', '.Characters', '4', '5', 'cars', 'Lots', 'variety', 'department', 'Most', 'characters', 'were', 'believable', 'acted', 'accordingly', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'expecting', 'First', 'Mater', 'voiced', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'was', 'riot', 'Mack', 'truck', 'had', 'awfully', 'familiar', 'voice', '*wink*', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'only', 'casting', 'choice', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'Sally', 'sounded', 'too', 'old', 'part.Plot', '4', '5', 'cars', 'twist', 'pattern', 'while', 'then', 'twist', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'coming', 'Comedic', 'bits', 'interspersed', 'Pretty', 'quality', 'stuff.Animation', '5', '5', 'cars', 'Animation', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Pixar', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'hard', 'animate', 'cars', 'faces.Music', '4', '5', 'cars', 'songs', 'not', 'original', 'perfectly', 'capture', 'essence', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'score', 'memorable', 'though.Impact', '3', '5', 'cars', ""'d"", 'say', 'most', 'important', 'section', 'review', 'did', 'get', 'involved', 'movie', 'when', 'saw', 'was', ""n't"", 'tear-jerker', 'big', 'finale', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'sense', 'triumph', 'was', 'essentially', 'whole', 'point', 'did', 'think', 'movie', 'saw', 'was', ""n't"", 'enamoured', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'hard', 'hitting', 'thoughts', 'characters', 'side', 'splitting', 'lines', 'quote.All', '4', '5', 'cars']",N/A

Then lately, I stumbled upon the DVD and purchased it on the advice of my companion. We watched it a couple evenings later. It's an amusing and somewhat touching movie. Dumb, perhaps, but amusing.The story involves Lightning McQueen, an ambitious rookie racecar who unexpectedly finds himself marooned in the old Route 66 Arizona town of Radiator Springs. McQueen was on route to the big Piston Cup Championship in California where he was to compete against two pros with whom he'd tied in a previous race.In Radiator Springs, McQueen gets in trouble with the law and has to do community service repairing the street. As such, he gets to know Some of the town's characters. Sally, a 2002 Porsche, becomes his lady friend. Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hudson Hornet, gradually reveals he was a previous three-time Piston Cup winner. Mater, a beat up but trusty tow truck, helps him realize that there are other things just as important as racing. McQueen eventually goes on to compete in the Piston Cup, where he could have won.It's an amusing story, well told. There are chuckles here and there. The depictions of the cars and the setting of Radiator Springs are interesting. In places, the movie is touching.

634388,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00005JNS0,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Rookie race car Lightning McQueen might ""float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beamer,"" but, at 116 minutes, CARS still took a leap of faith that it'd be able to hold the attention of its targeted rugrat audience. But, because this animated film is helmed by the Pixar folks (who apparently can do no wrong), CARS is diverting enough, oooh-inducing enough, and plot-worthy enough that the two hours mostly fly by in attentive bliss.The story and its message itself are nothing new - about how one should take the time to slow down, smell the flowers, and just aw-shucks appreciate life's awesomeness, and also how it's about the journey, not the destination...Trite, you say? Yes. But, you know what? Contrived and derivative though CARS's storyline may be, that time-worn message is still given brand new luster by the very credible and honest voice performances of the all-star cast and by the very outstanding and glossy animation provided by the Pixar Animation Studios. Owen Wilson (the cocky but inevitably likable Lightning McQueen), Paul Newman (the gruff Doc Hudson), and Larry the Cable Guy (that nutjob Tow Mater) are particularly wonderful in their roles; but every actor involved is nicely cast, including NASCAR legend Richard Petty as veteran race car champ The King.I appreciated and was moved by the movie's touching portrayal of the sparsely used Route 66 and its discarded mini-town Radiator Springs, which became forgotten when, to save an extra 10 minutes of driving, an interstate highway was built which bypassed it. This movie's world may be wholly populated by cars but one could certainly feel for the forlorn folks of Radiator Springs and their plight. The extra feature segment ""Inspiration for CARS"" delves more into Route 66 and its pit-stop towns that were left behind, which proved to be the basis for Radiator Springs.Special Features include 2 animated shorts: ""Mater and the Ghost Light"" (where everyone gets their revenge on the prank-pulling Mater) & the great ""One Man Band,"" CAR's full 4-minute-long epilogue shown without the end credits (where you can fully relish the automobile film versions of TOY STORY and MONSTER, INC.), the ""Inspiration for CARS"" segment with director John Lasseter, and over 10 minutes of deleted scenes.So, is CARS as good as Pixar's past monster hits? Heck, no. But CARS, on its own merit, is definitely worth watching. While it doesn't make you consistently laugh out loud, you'll get a chuckle here and there, and you'll end up having a good time. You might even feel a twinge of nostalgia or a pang of regret at the passing of a Route 66 that was at its heyday. Certainly, James Taylor's music helps to evoke those feelings. The voice cast plays their A-game, and, as usual with these Pixar cats, the animation is really something to behold. I had no idea automobiles could be so expressive and could garner such empathy. I went into this film when it first came out, thinking, ""Huh, cars that talk. Okay..."" But the movie did such a good job that when I walked out, I thought of these cars as real folks, though housed in steel, rubber, and a coat of paint. Doc, Mater, Sally, Guido, Luigi, Lightning McQueen...they're all good folks. So, yeah, man, by all means, let's go tractor-tipping. But, shhhh, don't let Frank catch you...",4,"""I'm in Hillbilly Hell!

Talking cars?  Well, Pixar had hit gold with talking fish but...cars?  I personally had doubts about this movie, but when I came out of watching it, I was very satisfied and pleasantly suprised.Much like Pixar's previous films, Cars is a story diven film.  And with only three real action scenes in the entire film (two at the beginning, one at the end), it depends on it's story to stay afloat and keep the audience interested.  And i'm happy to say that the film kept my interest the entire way through.Cars follows a hot and fast upcoming racer named Lightning McQueen, a racecar who will stop at nothing to get to the top and become the champion.  However, on his way to a tie-breaker race, he becomes lost in a little route 66 town that's fallen off the map.  Here, high and mighty ego clashes with small town slowness and McQueen undergos a personal journey to find himself and what really matters in his life.When trying to think of negatives for this movie...I can't think of any. There really is nothing wrong with Cars. There are no weak points that immediatly come to mind. It pulls your emotions in the right directions at the right time and for the right amount of time.  I laughed, chuckled and applauded at all the right moments (especially the farting tractors).  So did everyone else in the theater.  Even side charachters, some of whom have only a few lines, are strong and well played.  I'd say that there are no weak charachters in Cars, something that is all too rare these days.  Even those who don't really contribute to the plot (the surplus military jeep for example) are fun to watch.  This is a great film that anyone can watch and enjoy, though action fans might find themselves a bit bored during most of the movie.  It has a great message (sometimes you have to get lost to find yourself), morals about what's really important in life, and what's worth winning, and so much more.  Heck, even a malfunctioning stoplight is enjoyable to watch.  Everyone in the theater that I attended had a blast and enjoyed watching the movie.Cars is easily one of the best films of the year, the kind that you can't stop raving about, and is almost certianly going to be the main contender for best animated feature. This is annother winner for Pixar, and is a great film that everyone should watch at least once.Oh, and be sure to stay for the credits.

Anyway...With over a thousand reviews already rockin' Amazon, I just wanted to throw in a word for the Blu-ray.  Even though Cars is only about my 7th Most Favorite Pixar flick, it's a top 3 Pixar Blu-ray.  The following scenes, as rendered on Blu-ray, are really among my most pleasurable visual experiences of all time, not just counting stuff I saw on a tv screen:* The drive after the opening race.  From leaving the race track at night, all through the ""Life is a Highway"" montage, and then through the ordeal with the young punk cars, I almost can't believe what I'm looking at.  A dream sequence for anybody that's been intoxicated by highway driving at night:  the quiet, sleepy feeling, the low rumbles of the wheels, all those lights going by.  They even somehow captured that ""show-is-over"" feeling you get after a big arena event, the welcome of cool darkness and low playing radio after a big noisy show.  I could watch this section of the movie over and over.* Sally's and McQueen's ride together on the country road.* The dance/cruise night when the neon lights come on.  At the theater, I think my mouth literally dropped open at this.  I couldn't get over the neon and the reflections in the metallic paint and chrome.  And beyond the technical wizardry of making it look so real, they know how to make it look pleasant.  I sometimes wonder how many times they had to choose between what would be aesthetically pleasing and what would be utmost realism.  These guys are real masters, I think on the level with great painters, etc.There are other places I could go on about, but that gives you the idea.  If you even moderately enjoy Cars, get it on Blu-ray.  Or borrow it and watch those three scenes.  If those don't blow your mind, then I guess you can skip it (though it might be time for eye glasses...)",5,Blu-ray Review,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,1962,"['think', 'movie', 'big-time', 'underrated', 'predictable', 'yeah', 'so', 'was', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'Everything', 'story', ""n't"", 'about', 'surprise', 'Anyway', 'thousand', 'reviews', 'already', 'rockin', 'Amazon', 'just', 'wanted', 'throw', 'word', 'Blu-ray', 'Even', 'Cars', 'only', '7th', 'Most', 'Favorite', 'Pixar', 'flick', 'top', '3', 'Pixar', 'Blu-ray', 'following', 'scenes', 'rendered', 'Blu-ray', 'are', 'really', 'most', 'pleasurable', 'visual', 'experiences', 'time', 'not', 'just', 'counting', 'stuff', 'saw', 'tv', 'screen', '*', 'drive', 'opening', 'race', 'leaving', 'race', 'track', 'night', 'Life', 'Highway', 'montage', 'then', 'ordeal', 'young', 'punk', 'cars', 'almost', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', ""'m"", 'looking', 'dream', 'sequence', 'anybody', 'been', 'intoxicated', 'highway', 'driving', 'night', 'quiet', 'sleepy', 'feeling', 'low', 'rumbles', 'wheels', 'lights', 'going', 'even', 'somehow', 'captured', 'show-is-over', 'feeling', 'get', 'big', 'arena', 'event', 'welcome', 'cool', 'darkness', 'low', 'playing', 'radio', 'big', 'noisy', 'show', 'could', 'watch', 'section', 'movie', 'over', '*', 'Sally', 'McQueen', 'ride', 'together', 'country', 'road', '*', 'dance/cruise', 'night', 'when', 'neon', 'come', 'theater', 'think', 'mouth', 'literally', 'dropped', 'open', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'neon', 'reflections', 'metallic', 'paint', 'chrome', 'technical', 'wizardry', 'making', 'look', 'so', 'real', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'look', 'pleasant', 'sometimes', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'had', 'choose', 'would', 'be', 'aesthetically', 'pleasing', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'utmost', 'realism', 'guys', 'are', 'real', 'masters', 'think', 'level', 'great', 'painters', 'are', 'other', 'places', 'could', 'go', 'about', 'idea', 'even', 'moderately', 'enjoy', 'Cars', 'get', 'Blu-ray', 'borrow', 'watch', 'three', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'blow', 'mind', 'then', 'guess', 'can', 'skip', 'might', 'be', 'time', 'eye', 'glasses']",N/A
634405,A3UV7L5ND3EH8T,B00005JNS0,"Janet Boyer ""Snowland Deck and Coffee Tarot C...","[4, 6]","My son and I watched Cars on the big screen and I LOVED it! The songs were perfect--especially Real Gone and Life is a Highway.I've just watched the movie again, twice, on DVD. Unfortunately, my 25 inch TV screen doesn't do this movie justice! (It's one of those movies that pack a wallop when watched on the big screen...)The realism achieved in this movie is amazing, especially with Lightning's shiny red paint job and the ""fumes"" rising from the drag cars. The writing is especially clever, too. (Look for the shapes in the rocky background at Radiator Springs.) For example, Harv, Lightning's fast-talking publicist/agent admonishes his client to get out of ""Radiation Stinks"" (you gotta hear it to appreciate it.)Every single time I watch this movie, I choke up twice during the last race. There are some critics who say that Cars doesn't have ""heart"" like Toy Story or other Pixar features. I can't help but wonder if we're talking about the same movie! I feel that Cars has more heart than ANY Pixar movie thus far--especially as it shows that winning isn't everything and that dignity is found in much more than an ""empty cup"" (like the Piston Cup).The voices in this movie are perfect, especially Owen Wilson as Lightning and Larry the Cable Guy as Mater. (Gosh, what a scene stealer that Mater is! And the funny thing is, if you watch the 16-minute ""Inspiration for Cars"" clip, you'll see the actual Mater--who sounds a lot like the character!)Speaking of the 16 minute Inspiration clip, I'm surprised that this DVD didn't have more extras--not even a commentary or movie video or sample story boards or anything! That was a disappointment, I admit. (I'm used to Disney packing the extras on there! Heck, I found out neat trivia bits--like why number 96 was chosen for Lightning's car--but I didn't find this out from the DVD!)However, the 16-minute clip was quite touching, especially hearing how the director was inspired for Cars. Turns out that he has several boys and his wife said to him one day: ""You know, we supported you through Toy Story 1 and 2 and your other projects...but one day, you'll wake up to find that your little boys are now off to college.""This sobering realization spurred him to take an entire summer off with his wife and kids--a road trip in a motor home. He said it was the best time of his life. Alas, he combined the two loves of his parents (his mother was an artist and his Dad was a car buff) to create the wonderful movie Cars, which also reflects his newfound wisdom: you can push, push, push for that next accomplishment, and one day realize that you're friendless or perhaps alone.There's also some great laughs in this movie; I LOVE the tractor-tipping scene with Mater and Lightning! (OMG--and that Frank is scary!)As I said, the extras are slim pickins:--New animated short Mater and the Ghostlight (Amusing. Fans of Mater will *especially* love this short!)--Academy Award-nominated animated short: One Man Band (This was the cute short about two deuling musicians fighting for a coin that a girl wants to throw into a fountain. It's the same short shown at the theater before the Cars movie.)--John Lasseter's inspiration for Cars (Very good. Inspirational in its own right.)--Ratatouille teaser trailer (A movie about a mouse in France with expensive tastes)--Deleted scenesThis is an exceptional movie in terms of script, voice acting, music, authenticity, and animation. Car and racing lovers will no doubt love it, as will fans of Pixar. (Personally, I can't STAND car racing--or country music--but I loved both the soundtrack and the plot! Goes to show that one doesn't HAVE to be into cars to enjoy this movie.)",5,Slick Movie With Lots of Heart,1163548800,"11 15, 2006",2006,3672,"['son', 'watched', 'Cars', 'big', 'screen', 'LOVED', 'songs', 'were', 'perfect', 'especially', 'Real', 'Gone', 'Life', 'Highway.I', ""'ve"", 'just', 'watched', 'movie', 'again', 'twice', 'DVD', 'Unfortunately', '25', 'inch', 'TV', 'screen', ""n't"", 'do', 'movie', 'justice', 'one', 'movies', 'pack', 'wallop', 'when', 'watched', 'big', 'screen', 'realism', 'achieved', 'movie', 'amazing', 'especially', 'Lightning', 'shiny', 'red', 'paint', 'job', 'fumes', 'rising', 'drag', 'cars', 'writing', 'especially', 'clever', 'too', 'Look', 'shapes', 'rocky', 'background', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'example', 'Harv', 'Lightning', 'fast-talking', 'publicist/agent', 'client', 'get', 'Radiation', 'Stinks', 'got', 'ta', 'hear', 'appreciate', 'single', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', 'choke', 'up', 'twice', 'last', 'race', 'are', 'critics', 'who', 'say', 'Cars', ""n't"", 'have', 'heart', 'Toy', 'Story', 'other', 'Pixar', 'features', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', ""'re"", 'talking', 'same', 'movie', 'feel', 'Cars', 'more', 'heart', 'ANY', 'Pixar', 'movie', 'thus', 'far', 'especially', 'winning', ""n't"", 'everything', 'dignity', 'found', 'much', 'more', 'empty', 'cup', 'Piston', 'Cup', '.The', 'voices', 'movie', 'are', 'perfect', 'especially', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Lightning', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'Mater', 'Gosh', 'what', 'scene', 'stealer', 'Mater', 'funny', 'thing', 'watch', '16-minute', 'Inspiration', 'Cars', 'clip', ""'ll"", 'see', 'actual', 'Mater', 'who', 'lot', 'character', 'Speaking', '16', 'minute', 'Inspiration', 'clip', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'extras', 'not', 'even', 'commentary', 'movie', 'video', 'sample', 'story', 'boards', 'anything', 'was', 'disappointment', 'admit', ""'m"", 'used', 'Disney', 'packing', 'extras', 'Heck', 'found', 'out', 'neat', 'trivia', 'bits', 'why', 'number', '96', 'was', 'chosen', 'Lightning', 'car', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'DVD', 'However', '16-minute', 'clip', 'was', 'quite', 'touching', 'especially', 'hearing', 'how', 'director', 'was', 'inspired', 'Cars', 'out', 'several', 'boys', 'wife', 'said', 'one', 'day', 'know', 'supported', 'Toy', 'Story', '1', '2', 'other', 'projects', 'one', 'day', ""'ll"", 'wake', 'up', 'find', 'little', 'boys', 'are', 'now', 'college', 'sobering', 'realization', 'spurred', 'take', 'entire', 'summer', 'wife', 'kids', 'road', 'trip', 'motor', 'home', 'said', 'was', 'best', 'time', 'life', 'Alas', 'combined', 'two', 'loves', 'parents', 'mother', 'was', 'artist', 'Dad', 'was', 'car', 'buff', 'create', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'Cars', 'also', 'newfound', 'wisdom', 'can', 'push', 'push', 'push', 'next', 'accomplishment', 'one', 'day', 'realize', ""'re"", 'friendless', 'perhaps', 'also', 'great', 'laughs', 'movie', 'LOVE', 'tractor-tipping', 'scene', 'Mater', 'Lightning', 'OMG', 'Frank', 'scary', 'said', 'extras', 'are', 'slim', 'pickins', 'New', 'animated', 'short', 'Mater', 'Ghostlight', 'Amusing', 'Fans', 'Mater', 'will', '*especially*', 'love', 'short', 'Award-nominated', 'animated', 'short', 'One', 'Man', 'Band', 'was', 'cute', 'short', 'two', 'deuling', 'musicians', 'fighting', 'coin', 'girl', 'throw', 'fountain', 'same', 'short', 'shown', 'theater', 'Cars', 'movie', 'John', 'Lasseter', 'inspiration', 'Cars', 'Very', 'good', 'Inspirational', 'own', 'right', 'Ratatouille', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'movie', 'mouse', 'France', 'expensive', 'tastes', 'Deleted', 'scenesThis', 'exceptional', 'movie', 'terms', 'script', 'voice', 'acting', 'music', 'authenticity', 'animation', 'Car', 'racing', 'lovers', 'will', 'doubt', 'love', 'will', 'fans', 'Pixar', 'Personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'STAND', 'car', 'racing', 'country', 'music', 'loved', 'soundtrack', 'plot', 'show', 'one', ""n't"", 'HAVE', 'be', 'cars', 'enjoy', 'movie']",N/A

I loved the Route 66 scenes and the history lesson this film teaches about the dangerous by-products of consumerism and convenience. So we get somewhere ten minutes faster, big deal. But what do we lose in the process? The Interstate System opened up America, but in the process it closed the door to much Americana.As for Cars, it kick-started a renaissance in Route 66 ""Mother Road"" scholarship, or at the very least an interest in driving to see what's left. Speaking for myself, I have made a point to check out US 40 in Amarillo (72-ounce steak at the Big Texan, anyone?), and have high hopes of getting to Oklahoma and Arizona in the near future. Indeed, John Lasseter's inspiration for the film was his own family's cross-country road trip in 2000.Being equally honest, I didn't care for the racing scenes, even though they were visually impressive. Every Disney film has its villain, but Chuck Hicks was unnecessarily mean with no redeeming qualities. At least Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), despite starting his relationship with Lightning in an adversarial manner, ultimately transforms into a father-son mentor.There's also lots of crashing and aggression on the track, which certainly contributes to the rookie's unhealthy win-at-any-cost mentality, at least until he is forced to spend some down time in Radiator Springs, a la Doc Hollywood. (Did the writers of that film receive any credit for the blatant lift?)And while I like Mater's heart, I am unhappy that he has been fashioned into such a White Trash caricature. He's dumb and dirty and he talks funny. In my opinion, it's not enough to portray him as the tow truck equivalent of the ""whore with a heart of gold."" Overall, I was disappointed at the many simple stereotypes. Even Guido, though cute, is painted as a non-English speaking immigrant, fit only to change tires.This film has its moments. I just don't think the people who embrace the Route 66 legacy are also going to cheer the NASCAR racing, and vice versa.

Pouliot,"[2, 5]","Pixar's last collaboration with Disney turns out to be a sweetly sentimental picture about days gone by - about the fast pace of the present leaving behind the ""simpler"" days of bygone years.""Cars"" is the interesting final act in a marriage between the most original maker of animated pictures and the marketing behemoth better know for its tried, trite and formulaic films. The film is completely predictable. Once we are introduced to self-sufficient, arrogant racecar ""Lightning McQueen,"" only the most obtuse of viewers could fail to predict that he will somehow learn the requisite lessons that 1) We All Must Rely On Others and 2) We Must All Slow Down To See The Beauty Arounf Us. Add a love interest, a motley collection  of oddballs and a bitter old racer who has turned his back on his old love of racing, and you have a potential carnival of clich&eacute;s. But ""Cars"" pretty much gets past banality to deliver a movie that is breathtaking to watch, often funny and almost moving.""Cars"" waxes rhapsodic about the pre-interstate experience of driving in which the journey, not the destination, was most important. The film adulates the old Route 66, with its neon-emblazoned motels, gas stations and drive-ins. It should probably not shock anyone that these establishments could be ugly, uncomfortable and lonely in their own right. But ""Cars"" lets us see their beautiful side, in which they catered to the basic needs of travelers of the 1950s and 60s while reflecting the values of their era.Animated or not, ""Cars"" is a crashing bore for the little kids.

634418,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B00005JNS0,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[3, 3]","Pixar has struck gold one again with this teriffic movie that's sure to become a classic.Lightning McQueen(Owen Wilson) is the hottest rookie car on the Piston Cup Circuit, but he's facing a challenge from two other cars: The King (Richard Petty) and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton).  All three cars are tied going into the final race of the season.  By the end of the race, McQueen has a huge lead over Hicks and The King, but he made a decision not to change tires earlier in the race.  Now, he suffers a blowout, allowing Hicks and The King to catch up.  The race ends in a three-way tie.  It is decided that there will be one winner-take-all race at the Los Angeles International Speedway the following week.  The three cars set off on their cross-country journey.Lightning is riding happily along in the back of his trailer when suddenly, something goes wrong.  Lightning finds himself out of his trailer and in the middle of a crowded interstate.  Meanwhile, his tractor/trailer keeps driving, not realizing Lightning is missing.  Lightning ends up in the sleepy town of Radiator Springs, on Route 66.Lightning's problems begin as soon as he enters town.  He ends up destroying the town's main road, is arrested by the sheriff, and impounded and booted in the town's impound lot.  In the lot, he meets Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), an old tow truck.  Then, he's taken to the courthouse, where Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) sentences lightning to fix the road before he'll be allowed to go on to his race in California.  There are other interesting cars in Radiator Springs, including Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), a hot-looking Porsche who runs the town hotel, Sarge the army jeep, and Flo, owner of Flo's V8 Cafe.  Radiator Falls used to be a bustling town, but since the interstate was built, very few travellers drive through.Lightning begins his job of re-paving the road and he finishes rather quickly, but Doc is unsatisfied with his work, so he tells Lightning to start over.  Frustrated, Lightning begins again.  However, something unexpected has been happening.  Lightning finds himself developing friendships with each car in Radiator Springs, especially Sally. Mater has taken a special liking to Lightning, even taking him tractor tipping. Mater calls Lightning his best friend. He also finds out that Doc is hiding a secret of his own from everyone in town.  Soon, the road is finished, and Lightning is free to go to his race in California.  But he's having second thoughts.  Sally took him for a drive, and Lightning was impressed with the beautiful scenery.  Sally also tells him about how Radiator Springs used to be a hub of activity and how she wishes it would be that way again.  Lightning even gets some new tires and a new paint job.  He doesn't look like the race car he was before.Just as it looks like Lightning has made up his mind to stay in Radiator Springs, the town is besieged by other cars and helicopters, along with Lightning's own truck.  They scoop him up and wisk him off to the race in California, leaving his friends in Radiator Springs surprised and Lightning sad.  Once at the track, Lightning, Hicks, and The King start their race.  The only member in Lightning's pit is his faithful truck, until he hears the voice of Doc Hudson.  All of his friends from Radiator Springs have come to help him.As for the race, Lightning has been trailing The King and Hicks the entire way.  As the race enters its final laps, Hicks slams into The King, causing him to crash on the infield.  Lightning, only inches from the finish line and the Piston Cup Championship, makes a decision that changes his life.This is an excellent movie.  Pixar Studios has turned out some fine animated movies in recent years, but this is one of the best.  The story is both exciting and heartwarming, and its fun to watch Lightning learn that there's more to life than winning races and getting big sponsorships.  Friendship and trust are just as important.  Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Michael Keaton, and Richard Petty bring the animated cars to life in a style that is funny, and you'll find yourself cheering for each one.  Jay Leno, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Dale Waltrip, Mario Andretti, and Bob Costas lend their talents to the collection of cars, too.I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Children and adults will enjoy this revved-up and exciting movie.  Ka Chow!",5,Ka Chow!

634421,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00005JNS0,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[6, 6]","Criticism of this movie is a mystery to me. My kids has so far place this movie on there top ten mini lists. I have yet to see a bad Pixar film (even ""A Bug's Life"" is still entertaining, for kids anyway) and the only reason that I can think of is how difficult it is to follow a film of such real quality like ""The Incredibles"". I'm honestly struggling to think of a fault with this film which is bright, colourful, noisy and funny - perfect for the younger members of your family. But there is also more than enough for the adults to enjoy as well, not even mentioning the exceptionally high standard of animation and voice casting. ""Cars"" introduces us to a world where there are no people and cars are alive (and not just cars - helicopters, SUVs, tractors, you name it).Once you've adjusted yourself to the quirky world of ""Cars"" then you're in for a real treat. The first thing you notice is the epic scale of the thing and how wonderful it all looks. Whether it's crowded stands at a stadium or the timeless beauty of the Grand Canyon, Pixar provides further proof (if any were needed) that they are the new masters of animation. Everything is bright and full of colour and life and after a while, you even forget that you're watching a cartoon altogether! I thought that a new standard had been reached in animation with ""The Incredibles"" but this looks even better than that. The voice casting is also superb, as always, with Newman and Wilson leading a cast of real quality. Even finding Jeremy Clarkson and Michael Schumacher in cameos was a real blast, although American audiences probably would have enjoyed (and recognised) Jay Leno or Mario Andretti a bit more. Some characters maybe weren't as defined as others - low-rider Ramone (Cheech Marin) and 50's cruiser Flo (Jenifer Lewis) weren't as defined as others and didn't feel part of the story - but with so much on screen (especially during the race sequences), it's easy to lose some aspects of the film in the noise and spectacle.The dialogue is littered with one-liners while references and in-jokes abound (Lightning's tyre, for example, are called ""Lightyears""). The pace of the movie also fitted the story - fast and loud at the start, slow and quiet in Radiator Springs - and the whole thing is filled with the typically enthusiastic imagination that Pixar infuse their pictures with. However, for all of the technical brilliance of ""Cars"", I still prefer ""The Incredibles"" - it's more fun and doesn't sag in the middle as much as this did. But ""Cars"" is still a wonderful film and one that appears to have been underrated already by certain other critics. Don't listen to them - this is a family film of genuine class and quality and you'll be missing out if you don't watch it.

The movie gets better when he  gets stuck in a small town and forced to fix a wrecked road there if he wants to leave. If he doesn't leave soon he will miss out being in a big race and becoming the big star he wants to be. The longer he's stuck there though the more he finds that he likes it there and the more he learns to be less self-centered. He also learns to care about other people.....oops, I mean other cars.At first I only found Cars to be a great movie to look at and nothing else. Then I got more and more into the story and I soon found it to be as good as other big Disney Pixar hits like Toy Story 1 and 2 and The Incredibles and Finding Nemo. Cars is a smart, charming and sometimes even a touching film. Disney missed out for being nominated last year for best animated film ""thanks to Chicken Little being pretty weak"".

Because of the theme, you can enjoy this as a Nascar fan who has never seen Pixar before OR as a Pixar fan who has never followed Nascar.

From that perspective, this may seem like so much cheese to some, and you can be warned. However, this is just part of the Pixar formula, and it seems to work every time.The artwork is grand, and the acting... errr... voices are good too.

After checking out Cars last night, I'll amend what I said about Cars 2 being as good and admit that Cars had a more focused storyline and was also a little funnier.In a nutshell, a little red race car named Lightning McQueen has issues, particularly he's selfish, narcissistic, and doesn't need a pit crew. A mishap en route to California's Piston Cup to settle a 3 way tiebreaker lands him in a lazy southwest desert town occupied by old forgotten automobiles where McQueen learns that the universe doesn't revolve around him and that sometimes we all need to slow down and smell the roses.Immediate impressions can be deceiving. From not having seen this film in a few years I thought its age would show against the sequel but this wasn't the case as this film still looks and sounds equally as beautiful and powerful as its successor. In my Cars 2 review I said that it looked superior to this film but seeing them side by side I'd have to take that back. Some say that this film is shallow compared to Pixar's other films but I disagree. Also, a big kudos to the characters in this film. What I mean is that the cars match the personalities they embody perfectly. Hudson, the big Buick with the big chrome grill behaves exactly how it looks, as does ol' rusty bucktoothed Mater, and my favorites Guido (Volkswagen) and Luigi (forklift).

From the story line to the voiceovers to the exquisitely fine details (including the in-jokes) of the animation, CARS is a flat-out winner, and only NASCAR fanatics (of which I am not one) could possibly care that some racing rules are conveniently ignored here and there.I am SO glad that the animators didn't stop at the stiffer, more photo-realistic level of animation we saw in an early trailer; ""humanizing"" the cars by giving them the facial and body expressions required comprise just the touch that was needed. Most stunning to me was the near-photo-realistic animation of the mountains, trees and waterfalls in a high pass (which actually made Pixar's rendering farm crash at first) -- it's so breathtaking that it really needs widescreen formatting to do it justice.After I saw it in the theater, I exclaimed, ""I may never look at a car in the same way again!""

All the characters are- yes- cars! This may take a little getting used to, but it works well.Our hero, cocky young race car Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson), earns his way into a race-off for the Piston Cup, but he falls out of his truck and winds up in the colorful, but faded, Western town of Radiator Springs (a beautifully rendered duplicate of northern Arizona). There, he does community service as a paver while meeting the various""car-acters"" in town. The most interesting of these is Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), a sleek vintage '51 Hudson Hornet who serves as mayor, judge and doctor. There's also Mater, the zany tow truck (Larry the Cable Guy); Sally, the Porsche and former hotshot LA lawyer (a likable Bonnie Hunt), and a great little comic-relief duo: Luigi and Guido, the Italian-accented Fiat and forklift who run a tire store (Tony Shalhoub). Lightninglearns a little more about life and returns to the speedway a new man- I mean car. It's all nicely done and has a different kind of feel than other Pixar movies- more of an easy-going road trip than a slam-bang adventure or undersea odyssey. The racing sequences, narrated by real-life announcers Bob Cutlass (I mean, Costas) and Darrell Waltrip, add genuine excitement that even non-gearheads like me will love. Did we mention that even the announcers are cars?""Cars"" comes in a package that's a little slimmer than the other Pixar DVDs, but this movie looks good. Two shorts, the cute ""One Man Band""(two street musicians, a boy, and an Italian town square) and ""Mater and the Ghostlight"", are part of it along with a short but interesting documentary that details Pixar honcho John Lasseter's surprising car background (his dad ran a body shop), love of Route 66-style road culture and research into NASCAR broadcasts. There's also an epilogue with little spoofs of past Pixar hits like ""Monster Trucks, Inc."" that will delight outtake fans. Musical choices include the doo-wop classic ""Sh-Boom"" (the Chords' version) and, at the end, a nifty take on ""Route 66"" by John Mayer. Randy Newman's back, too, with the poignant ""Our Town"" (sung by James Taylor).""Cars"" may not wow you at first, aside from the racing portions, but it will grow on you.

634441,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B00005JNS0,Joshua Koppel,"[4, 6]","Lightning McQueen is a rookie race car in a world populated by cars, trucks and other vehicles.  Lightning is the hottest rookie around and he has a shot at the top title.  But a rematch sends him to California.  Unfortunately he gets lost on the way and winds up in Radiator Springs, a small town along old Route 66.  His visit gets him in trouble and he winds up being stuck in town while performing community service.At first Lightning is a smug egotist.  All he thinks about is himself.  He does not care about others.  But the people and the relaxed attitude of Radiator Springs starts to leave its mark on the race car.  Soon he realizes that caring about others is important.  His personality begins to change.  Soon he is back on his way to California for his chance at the title.This is a fun and creative movie.  The story at the heart of the film is as every bit a classic as Dickens's A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  A strong and clear message that shows you can be good and successful at the same time.  The whole car motif is carried all the way even using tiny VW bugs as the world's insects.  Good characters help fill out the story.  Two additional stories are included.  One is Mater and the Ghostlight (the Ghostlight is mentioned in the film) and the second is a delightful tale of two performers competing for the coin of a young child (this on is called One-Man Band).  The film itself ends with an epilogue that was not in the theater that I thought was pretty good and in keeping with the tone and ending of the film.  All in all just a really fun movie that the whole family can enjoy.

For the story, it is very straight forward that Lightning McQueen is attempted to go to California for the tiebreaker race.  However, during that time, he has to face a tough time when his delivery truck suddenly falls off and McQueen falls out of the truck and when he chases the truck back by speeding, he is caught by police and he has to do a community service and the time is against him too, he has to beat his pressure to secure a spot for that important race for him.  This story although is kind of easy to understand, it is basically good.  For the acting, they are all good.  For the direction, it is fantastic because all the scenes are logical.  My favorite part for this movie is the visual.  They are so funny and of course, Ka-Chow!  For the music, the songs feature in this movie is fantastic.

634464,A27P0MW8TE1JQP,B00005JNS0,Kevin J. Loria,"[14, 17]","Pixar's animation studio has not only been the go-to studio to continuely raise the bar for CG animation, but PIXAR pretty much created the bar itself. One reoccurring negative in their reel reign (aside from their contractual obligations and burden of partnership w/ DISNEY) was those darn humans. From Andy and his family to the very stylized characters of their last outstanding outing ""The Incredibles"" those probamatic people seem to be holding the studio back from the Zen of true animated perfection. The award-winning ""Finding Nemo"" has Spartan servings of those CGI simians and ""A Bug's Life"" none at all. So now with ""CARS"" Pixar has not only eliminated the humans, but also the human form. Sure the cars in CARS are anthropomorphized, that's a given, otherwise it's a HERBIE movie or Knight Rider without the Hasslehoff. This project is more akin to the claymation CHEVRON commercials of the 90's from AARDMAN ANIMATIONS. The imagery is hard to shake, but maybe that's a plus, not a minus, `cause most of us loved those guys and, I think, most of us will love these guys too.Pixar has outdone itself again with this one, the animation is flawless, the opening of the movie immerses us in the NASCAR-like track series: Dinoco's ""Piston Cup (Dinoco a Toy Story reference, as is the tires and the blimps, they're ""Lightyears"" of course) in a world where cars are both cars and people. The graphics at the race are absolute perfection, slamming the screen with racing commentary, stats and glitter. The race itself looks as if it were filmed for IMAX, beautiful!! Accept cars just can't bend and move like that, let alone emote and express the seemingly limitless range of expressions and attitudes these car can. Pixar has really outdone themselves!The story is the only thing that isn't exceptional about the movie, it is archetypical racing fare. The young ""oh-too-full-of-himself rookie"" LIGHTNING MCQUEEN (voice perfectly by Owen Wilson) has a hard lesson to learn about treating others and that he really does need friends. Already at the films opening, his disregard for others nearly costs him the race, but he manages a tie, a three-way-tie with CHICK HICKS, a ruthless competitor and The King, a racing legend (voiced by real legend Richard Petty). Immediately ignoring advise from the King that would have saved him a lot of trouble, enroute to the tie-breaker for the Cup Lightning loses his way finding himself in the town of Radiator Springs, and in trouble. While repairing the road-damage he caused he meets an ensemble of unlikely, yet inevitable friends who teach him the lessons he so desperately needs. (Tow-)Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) becomes Lightning's best friend, Sally (voiced by Bonnie Hunt) is a Porshe who charms Lightning, then there's Doc Hudson (voiced by Paul Newman). Doc, serves as Radiator Springs doctor (mechanic), Judge, and he also serves as Lightning's archetypical mentor. The old 1951 Hudson Hornet who was a famous 3 time-Cup winner himself gives Lightning McQueen more than just advise, he gives the rookie racer an insight into the real spirit of racing and a Shakespearean themed notion of how to remain true to yourself. Everntually McQueen makes it to his Tie-breaker, but his heart isn't in it without his new friends. I won't tell you who wins the cup or how, but true to the archetype, McQueen's mentor shows up to guide him  through the race. This clich&#65533; is not only one we've seen before in the race genre, but as recently as this year in Disney's Herbie Fully-Loaded. That's okay it still has solid impact just this one more time.Pixar's voice-casting as always is top-notch, Owen Wilson is the quintessential hotshot, I mean it is his bread & butter in front of the camera. Larry ""TCG""  as Mater is his classic good ol' boy that keeps him in flannels. Paul Newman as Doc, what a terrific and moving job the 79 yea old does, bringing so much to such a small part, amazing! Also superb comic characterizations from Tony Shalhoub (Monk) as the Italian tire-shop owner and Fiat 500 and classic George Carlin as a classic VW burned out hippie van. And YES! John Ratzenburger is in CARS! The Pixar ""good luck charm"" himself John Ratzenburger, who voices a character in ALL of the Pixar/Disney releases in back in this one too as Mack! If you sit through the credits, as always with Pixar, you will get a treat, this time specifically poking fun a past works and the actor. Also, bless you Pixar for getting the ""CAR TALK"" brothers ""Click & Clack"" on board, they so needed to advice us not to ""drive like my brother."" Great!Cars is the first feature since TOY STORY 2 to have co-founder / executive producer John Lasseter direct and it isn't a disappointment. This may be Pixar's best work to date; it is definitely the best film so far of the summer of '06.  The only weak link here is the obligatory sentimental music montage, that each of Lasseter's works have. This one tells or rather shows the story of how Radiator Springs fell by the wayside off route 66, maybe little too awkwardly setting up Sally's desire to see the town returned to its former glory, which an hour and 55 minutes later, it is. The music there and overall, could be stronger, lots of road refs, okay but that's really my only complaint. I still say, go take a second lap, you'll need to see it twice, in order to catch all the little jokes.",5,KA-CHOW!!

I didn't understand why Pixar would take one of their most popular films and give it such a mediocre treatment.  Well.....now that I have the Blu-ray version of this film, I think I know why.  They were saving it all for Cars debut on hi-def.  This has to be the best looking picture I have seen yet on a hi-def title.  I looks almost like the entire film is in 3-D!!!  I managed to catch part of this movie on a hi-def cable channel and thought I would compare the two pictures.  After a little fiddling, I managed to get both screens at the exact same frame, and was blown away at how much clearer the Blu-ray picture is.  The Cine-Explore feature on this is the best special feature I've seen on a hi-def title.  It is almost sensory overload at the amount of material that continuously pops up across the screen while the film is playing.  This disc will be the one I will pop in to show my friends what Blu-ray is capable of doing.  Every Blu-ray owner needs to get this title.

634466,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005JNS0,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 2]","The guys over at Pixar must be drinking some really good stuff.  It seems that no matter what ideas that they come up with, they always manage to make a great film out of them.  ""Cars"" is a prime example of that.  When I first saw the trailers for this ""vehicle,"" I have to admit that I had absolutely no interest in this film.  However, my daughter wanted to see it with one of her friends and I, along with my wife and my daughter's friend's mother and brother, headed out to see ""Cars.""  It was wonderful.  Granted, it isn't as good as some of Pixar's other efforts, but it suffices as a family comedy that everyone can watch together.Much like ""A Bug's Life"" and ""The Incredibles,"" ""Cars"" relies heavily on good-natured comedy to plug its message into the audience.  The story starts off with a race that's being lead by hotshot rookie, Lightning McQueen, eternal runner-up, Chick Hicks, and the elder racer on his way out, The King.  After the race ends in a three-way tie, it's decided that a race will be held in California to determine the winner of the Piston Cup.  McQueen, voiced by Owen Wilson, is determined to get to California first and pushes his Mack truck, voiced by Pixar staple, John Ratzenberger, to drive on through the night to get there.  Of course, Mack falls asleep and McQueen is accidentally dumped in the middle of nowhere, a nice little town called Radiator Springs.Once there, McQueen is introduced to a kaleidoscope of funny characters voiced by the likes of another Pixar staple, Bonnie Hunt, Paul Newman, Cheech Marin, George Carlin, and Tony Shalhoub.  Larry the Cable Guy, who's the least funny of the ""Blue Collar"" guys in my opinion, makes this flick worth it for youngsters.  He supplies the bulk of the comedy for the kiddos.  Other voices that some, especially race fans, might pick out are Richard Petty (The King), Dale, Jr. as Junior, Mario Andretti as himself, and others such as Bob Costas, Katherine Helmond, and Michael Keaton.While in Radiator Springs, McQueen learns that it isn't always the person who comes in first or has the most bobbleheads of themselves that makes them happy.  It's just being in the place you need to be no matter what the circumstances.The story does run a bit long for a film focused primarily on children, and it doesn't hold up as well as the last long Pixar flick, ""The Incredibles.""  However, there's just enough laughs and in-jokes for parents and kids to make it through.  This isn't one of Pixar's best films, but it's still a fine addition to their catalogue.Highly recommended to families, especially if you have race fans in yours.

While many think I may be cold and emotionless and it's quite unfashionable to be critical of this movie, I had actually been incredibly impressed by Pixar's track record prior to this film. ""Toy Story,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" and ""The Incredibles"" are all film I would have rated among the best in their respective years. And ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" are astute crowd pleasers that tug at your heartstrings.But, alas, I was a bit let down with ""Cars."" It's not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. It just might have been a tad too calculated for its own good, and for the first time--the emotion seemed too manufactured. I never cared about the plight of our automobile friends in the same way as I did for the toys, the fish and the superhero family. With a plot as obvious as this, so linear and expected in every way--maybe the movie's heart never connected with me because their was no ""real"" drama or surprise. Everything proceeds just as you know it will.""Cars"" is a great looking movie as you would expect. The visuals are fun and colorful. The soundtrack is great--the sound effects and ambient music are crisp and spot on. Layering in known songs like ""Life Is A Highway"" actually enliven the film far more than the few original tunes that unfortunately play as cliche. The cast is game. Owen Wilson's distinctive voice lends great amusement and Paul Newman is terrific. There are moments of genuine humor and great laughs--come on, tractor tipping is classic.Then why, oh why, am I so apathetic about this film? Ultimately, I've just seen this formula before--it's too predictable. Is it still a movie worth seeing? Sure. Might the kids love it? Sure. But it's missing the heart and genuineness of Pixar's earlier works. Oh, it still has all the emotional elements in place--but here they just don't ring true.

634472,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B00005JNS0,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[2, 6]","CARS is by far the weakest of the collaborations by Disney and Pixar. The animation is certainly up to Pixar's very high standards. Younger children will love the colorful universe that appears onscreen. CARS is a NASCAR-inspired tale of a world populated strictly by motor vehicles. It is the story of Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), rookie racer nonpareil, who is in a run-off in a three way tie in the Piston Cup. Lightning is young, cocky, self-assured, unpolished, and in love with flash and glitter.On his way to the run-off, Lightning accidentally ends up exiting I-40 to find himself on a forgotten stretch of The Mother Road, Route 66, speeding through the forgotten town of Radiator Springs. Pulled over, he faces the town judge, ""Doc"" Hudson (voiced by Paul Newman, a lifelong racer himself). Doc is about to let Lightning go when the town Attorney Sally Carrera (a Porsche, voiced by Bonnie Hunt), convinces Doc to lock him up for destruction of property. Lightning must do Community Service before he can get on his way.I found myself strangely troubled by CARS. The movie has an odd anti-capitalist cant to it, denigrating success in favor of a retreat into a kind of colorless anonymity. There's nothing wrong at all with caring for one's neighbors or supporting one's community, but having a healthy sense of community does not preclude someone from enjoying their own accomplishments.CARS lacks the heart of the TOY STORY films and FINDING NEMO. Quite surprisingly, the characters in CARS aren't very nice to one another, or, for that matter, nice at all. Lightning is cocky, and riding for a fall. That's OK, it's a classic plotline, but the way it all plays out gave me a distinctly uncomfortable feeling. The morality of CARS is convoluted and unclear, and certainly much more complicated than it should be for a film supposedly directed at children. Personal vendettas underlie much of the film's momentum.Lightning is a self-described ""one man show"" who wants to win the big race in order to get the big bucks and the big endorsements, and has perhaps cheated to make his way into the run-off race.Sally Carerra has Lightning convicted not because of the minor property damage he has caused but because she dislikes the glitz and glam he admires (something she turned her back on when she came to Radiator Springs). She derides Lightning throughout the film by giving him an unkind nickname.Doc turns out to be a world famous retired racer himself, who, after a devastating accident, was unable to make a comeback and was forgotten by a fickle public. Embittered, he retreated to Radiator Springs to brood on his disappointments. Doc wants Lightning to pay the price for his own unhappiness.The rest of the denizens of the town spend most of their time complaining about how the Interstate has passed them by. Their shops are dusty. There's no business. But when Lightning the stranger comes to town, they treat him with all the hick small town xenophobia they can muster. Only Mater, a dopey, buck-toothed and rusty tow truck befriends him, taking him tractor tipping in the night (they get chased off by Frank, an enraged combine). Mater calls Lightning, ""my best friend,"" but Lightning never reciprocates.Ironically, things don't change in Radiator Springs until Lightning repaves the road. The rest of the town's cars get to work, painting and fixing and replacing the burnt-out neon bulbs on the roadside joints. Radiator Springs spruces up, but it definitively says something that not one of the natives bothered to get off their rusty tailpipes to do anything to fix the town until after they force Lightning to do the dirty work.Of course, once they get the place in order, Lightning's their hero. Having learned a lesson about community, Lightning goes on to a surprising finish in the run-off race.With its ethics badly in need of a tune up, I think it'd be all right for your kids to miss CARS.",2,"""Here in my car, I feel safest of all . . .""---Gary Numan",1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,3938,"['CARS', 'far', 'weakest', 'collaborations', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'animation', 'certainly', 'up', 'Pixar', 'very', 'high', 'standards', 'Younger', 'children', 'will', 'love', 'colorful', 'universe', 'onscreen', 'CARS', 'NASCAR-inspired', 'tale', 'world', 'populated', 'strictly', 'motor', 'vehicles', 'story', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'voiced', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'rookie', 'racer', 'nonpareil', 'who', 'run-off', 'three', 'way', 'tie', 'Piston', 'Cup', 'Lightning', 'young', 'cocky', 'self-assured', 'unpolished', 'love', 'flash', 'glitter.On', 'way', 'run-off', 'Lightning', 'accidentally', 'up', 'exiting', 'I-40', 'find', 'forgotten', 'stretch', 'Mother', 'Road', 'Route', '66', 'speeding', 'forgotten', 'town', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'Pulled', 'over', 'town', 'judge', 'Doc', 'Hudson', 'voiced', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'lifelong', 'racer', 'Doc', 'let', 'Lightning', 'go', 'when', 'town', 'Attorney', 'Sally', 'Carrera', 'Porsche', 'voiced', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'Doc', 'lock', 'up', 'destruction', 'property', 'Lightning', 'must', 'do', 'Community', 'Service', 'can', 'get', 'way.I', 'found', 'strangely', 'troubled', 'CARS', 'movie', 'odd', 'anti-capitalist', 'cant', 'denigrating', 'success', 'favor', 'retreat', 'kind', 'colorless', 'anonymity', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'caring', 'one', 'neighbors', 'supporting', 'one', 'community', 'having', 'healthy', 'sense', 'community', 'not', 'preclude', 'someone', 'enjoying', 'own', 'accomplishments.CARS', 'heart', 'TOY', 'STORY', 'films', 'FINDING', 'NEMO', 'Quite', 'surprisingly', 'characters', 'CARS', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'nice', 'one', 'matter', 'nice', 'Lightning', 'cocky', 'riding', 'fall', 'OK', 'classic', 'plotline', 'way', 'out', 'gave', 'distinctly', 'uncomfortable', 'feeling', 'morality', 'CARS', 'convoluted', 'unclear', 'certainly', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'should', 'be', 'film', 'supposedly', 'directed', 'children', 'Personal', 'vendettas', 'underlie', 'much', 'film', 'momentum.Lightning', 'self-described', 'one', 'man', 'show', 'who', 'win', 'big', 'race', 'order', 'get', 'big', 'bucks', 'big', 'endorsements', 'perhaps', 'cheated', 'make', 'way', 'run-off', 'race.Sally', 'Carerra', 'Lightning', 'convicted', 'not', 'minor', 'property', 'damage', 'caused', 'glitz', 'glam', 'something', 'turned', 'back', 'when', 'came', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'Lightning', 'film', 'giving', 'unkind', 'nickname.Doc', 'out', 'be', 'world', 'famous', 'retired', 'racer', 'who', 'devastating', 'accident', 'was', 'unable', 'make', 'comeback', 'was', 'forgotten', 'fickle', 'public', 'Embittered', 'retreated', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'brood', 'disappointments', 'Doc', 'Lightning', 'pay', 'price', 'own', 'unhappiness.The', 'rest', 'denizens', 'town', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'complaining', 'how', 'Interstate', 'passed', 'shops', 'are', 'dusty', 'business', 'when', 'Lightning', 'stranger', 'town', 'treat', 'hick', 'small', 'town', 'can', 'muster', 'Only', 'Mater', 'dopey', 'buck-toothed', 'rusty', 'tow', 'truck', 'taking', 'tractor', 'tipping', 'night', 'get', 'chased', 'off', 'Frank', 'enraged', 'combine', 'Mater', 'Lightning', 'best', 'friend', 'Lightning', 'never', 'reciprocates.Ironically', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'Lightning', 'road', 'rest', 'town', 'cars', 'get', 'work', 'painting', 'fixing', 'replacing', 'burnt-out', 'neon', 'bulbs', 'roadside', 'joints', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'up', 'definitively', 'something', 'not', 'one', 'natives', 'bothered', 'get', 'off', 'rusty', 'tailpipes', 'do', 'anything', 'fix', 'town', 'force', 'Lightning', 'do', 'dirty', 'work.Of', 'course', 'once', 'get', 'place', 'order', 'Lightning', 'hero', 'Having', 'learned', 'lesson', 'community', 'Lightning', 'surprising', 'finish', 'run-off', 'race.With', 'ethics', 'badly', 'need', 'tune', 'up', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'right', 'kids', 'miss', 'CARS']",N/A

The arrogance of youth costs Lightning the race and the three way tie requires one more race a week later in California for the title and the lucrative endorsement.  But on the way there Lightning get separated from Mack (John Ratzenberger), the big rig in which he travels, and ends up making the mistake of speeding through the town of Radiation Springs.  So instead of preparing for the big race, he is doing community service in a town that has been bypassed by the Interstate and all but forgotten.Radiation Springs, of course, is filled with all sorts of interesting cars.  Lightning is arrested by the Sheriff (Michael Wallis), and sentenced to repair the road by Doc Hudson (Paul Newman in a masterstroke of casting), at the insistence of Sally Careera (Bonnie Hunt), who runs the motel and is also the city attorney.  Mater the tow truck (Larry the Cable Guy) becomes Lightning's new friend and teaches him the joys of midnight tractor tipping, while Luigi (Tony Shalhoub) wants to sell him tires.  There is also Flo (Jenifer Lewis) at the diner, and Sarge the Jeep (Paul Dooley) and Filmore the VW Bus (George Carlin) from the 60s rubbing each other the wrong way.  There is also a tin Lizzie (Kathrine Helmond), who still remembers when the place was founded by Stanley the Steamer.  There are a series of lessons that Lightning needs to learn, and this film goes through all of them right by the numbers.  Things might get a bit predictable, but there is a nice surprise at the end when Lightning puts winning in its proper place, so the little kids are clearly ahead of the game at the end of this one.More than what has come before it this is a Pixar film that speaks to adults, who are in a much better sense to appreciate the sense of loss the film tries to represent with the forgotten city of Radiator Springs (although I have to admit that it reminded me a bit of the abandoned town in the recent remake of ""House of Wax"").  This is a move about cars, but it is also once that celebrates the past and the wonders of nature as well as what fast driving machine can do.  Plus, this is a film that has Bonnie Hunt be a Porsche, which is certainly a bit of type casting that only us older folks can appreciate.  Final Note: The name of Lightning McQueen is apparently a reference to Glenn McQueen, a Pixar animator who died in 2002, but it also clearly resonates in terms of Steve McQueen, whose legendary car driving in ""Bullitt"" is still well remembered.",4,"Not firing on all pistons, but Pixar's ""Cars"" is still fine family enteratinment for the summer of 2006",1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,2837,"['Cars', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'least', 'Pixar', 'animated', 'films', 'put', 'out', 'Disney', 'case', 'future', 'computer', 'animated', 'films', 'exceedingly', 'bright', 'story', 'final', 'race', 'Piston', 'Cup', 'rookie', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'voiced', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'tied', 'King', 'Richard', 'Petty', 'bad', 'car', 'Chick', 'Hicks', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'lead', 'arrogance', 'youth', 'costs', 'Lightning', 'race', 'three', 'way', 'tie', 'one', 'more', 'race', 'week', 'later', 'California', 'title', 'lucrative', 'endorsement', 'way', 'Lightning', 'get', 'separated', 'Mack', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'big', 'rig', 'up', 'making', 'mistake', 'speeding', 'town', 'Radiation', 'Springs', 'So', 'instead', 'preparing', 'big', 'race', 'doing', 'community', 'service', 'town', 'been', 'bypassed', 'Interstate', 'forgotten.Radiation', 'Springs', 'course', 'filled', 'sorts', 'interesting', 'cars', 'Lightning', 'arrested', 'Sheriff', 'Michael', 'Wallis', 'sentenced', 'repair', 'road', 'Doc', 'Hudson', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'masterstroke', 'casting', 'insistence', 'Sally', 'Careera', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'who', 'motel', 'also', 'city', 'attorney', 'tow', 'truck', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'Lightning', 'new', 'friend', 'joys', 'midnight', 'tractor', 'tipping', 'Luigi', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'sell', 'tires', 'also', 'Flo', 'Jenifer', 'Lewis', 'diner', 'Sarge', 'Jeep', 'Paul', 'Dooley', 'VW', 'Bus', 'George', 'Carlin', '60s', 'rubbing', 'other', 'wrong', 'way', 'also', 'tin', 'Lizzie', 'Kathrine', 'Helmond', 'who', 'still', 'when', 'place', 'was', 'founded', 'Stanley', 'Steamer', 'are', 'series', 'lessons', 'Lightning', 'needs', 'learn', 'film', 'right', 'numbers', 'Things', 'might', 'get', 'bit', 'predictable', 'nice', 'surprise', 'end', 'when', 'Lightning', 'puts', 'winning', 'proper', 'place', 'little', 'kids', 'are', 'clearly', 'ahead', 'game', 'end', 'one.More', 'what', 'come', 'Pixar', 'film', 'adults', 'who', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'sense', 'appreciate', 'sense', 'loss', 'film', 'tries', 'represent', 'forgotten', 'city', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'have', 'admit', 'reminded', 'bit', 'abandoned', 'town', 'recent', 'remake', 'House', 'Wax', 'move', 'cars', 'also', 'once', 'past', 'wonders', 'nature', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'fast', 'driving', 'machine', 'can', 'do', 'film', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'be', 'Porsche', 'certainly', 'bit', 'type', 'casting', 'only', 'older', 'folks', 'can', 'appreciate', 'Final', 'Note', 'name', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'apparently', 'reference', 'Glenn', 'McQueen', 'Pixar', 'animator', 'who', 'died', '2002', 'also', 'clearly', 'terms', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'legendary', 'car', 'driving', 'Bullitt', 'still', 'well', 'remembered']",N/A

The moral of the story that you have to have good friends to make life worth living is one that kids everywhere can relate to.  Owen Wilson's voice is so good as Lightning McQueen that you actually feel like it's a living character.  As big a fan as I am of Bonnie Hunt, I actually didn't realize it was her voice as Sally the Porche until afterwards.  Paul Newman does an excellent job as the former Piston Cup winner Doc Hudson who has now retired to the small town after surviving a major accident and being unable to get sponsorship to get back in the races.

The beginning of this film is one long torturous session with ""Lightning McQueen"" who is to me the most non endearing character ever in any Pixar movie.  One dumb gag and cliche after another, and some genuinely bad writing, like when McQueen says ""I'm a one man show"".  Hey, there is no ""man"" in the Cars universe, so why would a car say something like that?Thankfully I gave it another chance and decided to watch it on my little flatpanel while walking on my treadmill.  The movie starts to really move when it slows down.  The 116 minutes is considered by some to be too long, but it added a lot of time for character development, and McQueen needed to develop a lot of character.To be brief, the beautifully rendered little world of Radiator Springs and its assortment of cute -- if rather one dimensional -- characters provided a context for McQueen to accept responsibility for his actions, grow up, and start thinking of vehicles other than himself.  The Porsche saved the movie for me.  She at least had some depth.I liked ""Doc"" too.  His story added another lesson to the story, that is, don't discount those who came before you. They're smarter than you think.I found the ending rather predictable (I was sure what would happen, but I just didn't know exactly how it would happen), but I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't yet seen the movie.So, three stars for a decent morality play and some mind bogglingly beautiful animation, and a tribute to motoring history.  Two stars off for shallow cliche characters (or should I say car-actors) and for having tons of eye-candy but a dearth of adult humor, and by ""adult"" I mean genuinly subtle and funny humor, not crass toilet humor.  With all it's strengths, Cars was a difficult movie for me to emotionally bond with, unlike the other Pixar films.Oh yeah, how is it that McQueen left Radiator Springs with whitewalls and that solid red and white paint pattern and then rolls out of Mac the next morning at the speedway back in his original paint, stickers, and tires.  Did I miss something?And, in real car racing you don't get to purposely collide with other cars and knock them off the track.  Chick Hick would have been banned from auto racing and likely charged with a felony in the real racing world.  They went so far to duplicate the realism of NASCAR, and I know cars sometimes touch, but it ain't supposed to be roller-derby, is it?The bonus featurs are fun, like the ""One Man Band"" cartoon and the extra ""Cars"" cartoon.  The ""deleted scenes"" are storyboard style but show how the movie could have been done differently, which I found quit interesting.Finally, this DVD just seems like ""round one"".  A year from now there will likely be the ""Special Two-Disc Ultra Ka-Chow"" version with multiple commentaries, documentaries, etc.  So, if you buy this version, I think you'll likely be buying Cars again.",3,"Takes a while to get out of first gear, then hauls asphalt.",1165190400,"12 4, 2006",2006,2958,"['first', 'time', 'tried', 'watch', 'movie', 'turned', 'off', '15', 'minutes', 'beginning', 'film', 'one', 'long', 'torturous', 'session', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'who', 'most', 'non', 'endearing', 'character', 'ever', 'Pixar', 'movie', 'One', 'dumb', 'gag', 'cliche', 'genuinely', 'bad', 'writing', 'when', 'McQueen', ""'m"", 'one', 'man', 'show', 'Hey', 'man', 'Cars', 'universe', 'so', 'why', 'would', 'car', 'say', 'something', 'Thankfully', 'gave', 'chance', 'decided', 'watch', 'little', 'flatpanel', 'walking', 'treadmill', 'movie', 'really', 'move', 'when', 'down', '116', 'minutes', 'considered', 'be', 'too', 'long', 'added', 'lot', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'McQueen', 'needed', 'develop', 'lot', 'character.To', 'be', 'brief', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'little', 'world', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'assortment', 'cute', 'rather', 'one', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'provided', 'context', 'McQueen', 'accept', 'responsibility', 'actions', 'grow', 'up', 'start', 'thinking', 'vehicles', 'other', 'Porsche', 'saved', 'movie', 'least', 'had', 'depth.I', 'liked', 'Doc', 'too', 'story', 'added', 'lesson', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'discount', 'who', 'came', ""'re"", 'smarter', 'think.I', 'found', 'ending', 'rather', 'predictable', 'was', 'sure', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'would', 'happen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'movie.So', 'three', 'stars', 'decent', 'morality', 'play', 'mind', 'bogglingly', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'tribute', 'motoring', 'history', 'Two', 'stars', 'shallow', 'cliche', 'characters', 'should', 'say', 'car-actors', 'having', 'tons', 'eye-candy', 'dearth', 'adult', 'humor', 'adult', 'mean', 'genuinly', 'subtle', 'funny', 'humor', 'not', 'crass', 'toilet', 'humor', 'strengths', 'Cars', 'was', 'difficult', 'movie', 'emotionally', 'bond', 'other', 'Pixar', 'films.Oh', 'yeah', 'how', 'McQueen', 'left', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'whitewalls', 'solid', 'red', 'white', 'paint', 'pattern', 'then', 'Mac', 'next', 'morning', 'speedway', 'back', 'original', 'paint', 'stickers', 'tires', 'Did', 'miss', 'something', 'real', 'car', 'racing', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'purposely', 'collide', 'other', 'cars', 'knock', 'off', 'track', 'Chick', 'Hick', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'banned', 'auto', 'racing', 'likely', 'charged', 'felony', 'real', 'racing', 'world', 'went', 'so', 'far', 'duplicate', 'realism', 'NASCAR', 'know', 'cars', 'sometimes', 'touch', 'ai', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'roller-derby', 'bonus', 'featurs', 'are', 'fun', 'One', 'Man', 'Band', 'cartoon', 'extra', 'Cars', 'cartoon', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'storyboard', 'style', 'show', 'how', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'differently', 'found', 'quit', 'interesting.Finally', 'DVD', 'just', 'round', 'one', 'year', 'now', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'Special', 'Two-Disc', 'Ultra', 'Ka-Chow', 'version', 'multiple', 'commentaries', 'documentaries', 'etc', 'So', 'buy', 'version', 'think', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'be', 'buying', 'Cars', 'again']",N/A
634489,A2RHV42BTJSVON,B00005JNS0,"Liolania ""In2Jesus""","[3, 3]","With thew somewhat dissapointing ""Rattatouille"", you may find yourself wondering ""Does Pixar still have magic?  Or are they being eaten by the Disney Moster?""  It is a legitimate question, and one that I will answer with one word: CARS.You may find yourself scratching your head in confusion because I say it is Paxiar's best to date, which would mean it is better than the ""Toy Story"" films and ""Finding Nemo"".  The reason this claim has been made is because although ""Toy Story"" and ""Finding Nemo"" were amazing, ""Cars"" succeeds on a few ways that those movies do not.Let us start with a synopsis.  This movie has an extremely simple premise; a race car with the name ""Lightning McQueen"" (voiced by Owen Wilson"" is living life in the ""fast lane"".  He is letting life pass him by so that he can be the youngest car to ever win a Piston Cup.  He is on the brink of winning it when by accident he winds up in a redneck town called ""Radiatory Springs"".  It seems to have frozen in time, and after Mcqueen tears the roads to shreds he is sentenced to community service, and well, these simple minded people of course teach him the point lessons he has failed to learn up to that point.The story on paper sounds mundane, but it is the visuals that are stunning (even by Pixar's standards) and the characters that bring this tale to life.  What makes this movie so good is that it will touch your heart, and remind you that there is more to life than trying to succeed, and that sometimes slowing down and just taking a drive to look at the scenery is a more satisfying than winning another trophy. It is the kind of movie that children and adults alike can enjoy. It has funny and animated characters for children like ""Tow Mater"" (Voiced to perfection by Larry the Cable Guy), more serious characters like ""Doc"" that is embittered, and sober-minded.While most these characters or characters like them are in other Pixar movies, that are just not as well fleshed out as they here.  Even if we cannot agree with me on this, we can agree that the visuals here are so amazing that you will forget you are watching a ""cartoon"".  This is one animated movie that will stand the test of time fifty years down the road and will be considered a great classic as well as a milestone in computer animation.I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!!!God Bless ~Amy",5,Pixar's Best Film to Date...,1188777600,"09 3, 2007",2007,2343,"['thew', 'somewhat', 'dissapointing', 'Rattatouille', 'may', 'find', 'wondering', 'Does', 'Pixar', 'still', 'have', 'magic', 'are', 'being', 'eaten', 'Disney', 'Moster', 'legitimate', 'question', 'one', 'will', 'answer', 'one', 'word', 'CARS.You', 'may', 'find', 'scratching', 'head', 'confusion', 'say', 'Paxiar', 'best', 'date', 'would', 'mean', 'better', 'Toy', 'Story', 'films', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'reason', 'claim', 'been', 'made', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'were', 'amazing', 'Cars', 'few', 'ways', 'movies', 'do', 'not.Let', 'start', 'synopsis', 'movie', 'extremely', 'simple', 'premise', 'race', 'car', 'name', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'voiced', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'living', 'life', 'fast', 'lane', 'letting', 'life', 'pass', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'youngest', 'car', 'ever', 'win', 'Piston', 'Cup', 'brink', 'winning', 'when', 'accident', 'up', 'redneck', 'town', 'called', 'Radiatory', 'Springs', 'have', 'frozen', 'time', 'Mcqueen', 'roads', 'shreds', 'sentenced', 'community', 'service', 'well', 'simple', 'minded', 'people', 'course', 'teach', 'point', 'lessons', 'failed', 'learn', 'up', 'point.The', 'story', 'paper', 'sounds', 'mundane', 'visuals', 'are', 'stunning', 'even', 'Pixar', 'standards', 'characters', 'bring', 'tale', 'life', 'What', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'will', 'touch', 'heart', 'remind', 'more', 'life', 'trying', 'succeed', 'sometimes', 'slowing', 'down', 'just', 'taking', 'drive', 'look', 'scenery', 'more', 'satisfying', 'winning', 'trophy', 'kind', 'movie', 'children', 'adults', 'alike', 'can', 'enjoy', 'funny', 'animated', 'characters', 'children', 'Tow', 'Mater', 'Voiced', 'perfection', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'more', 'serious', 'characters', 'Doc', 'embittered', 'sober-minded.While', 'most', 'characters', 'characters', 'are', 'other', 'Pixar', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out', 'here', 'Even', 'can', 'not', 'agree', 'can', 'agree', 'visuals', 'here', 'are', 'so', 'amazing', 'will', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'cartoon', 'one', 'animated', 'movie', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'fifty', 'years', 'road', 'will', 'be', 'considered', 'great', 'classic', 'as', 'well', 'milestone', 'computer', 'animation.I', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'God', 'Bless', '~Amy']",N/A

It has evolved from a novelty, to truly a beautiful form of art.  Cars, especially the scenery, was visually amazing...AMAZING!!!However...I noticed my children fidgeting throughout the film.  I could tell that they were losing interest rather quickly.  I did not see them laughing out loud with any frequency.  Unfortunately, they seemed more interested in the popcorn, rather than the film.  Afterwards I asked them how they liked the film and they just shrugged their shoulders.  There was never a moment that one could really feel sorry for Lightning McQueen or emphasize with him.

634497,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005JNS0,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[4, 5]","Rookie race car Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson of ""Rushmore,"" ""Shanghai Noon"" and ""Behind Enemy Lines"" fame) finished the Piston Cup in a three-way tie with two other cars, including The King (Richard Petty), who is retiring.  The King is leaving behind a position as a product endorser that Lightning McQueen would love to have.  Another race between the three winners is ordered to determine the winner of the Piston Cup.Lightning McQueen heads off to California in a trailer pulled by Mack (John Ratzenberger).  McQueen insists Mack drive through the night to California.  Unfortunately, Mack falls asleep and leaves McQueen in the desert.  Reminiscent of ""Doc Hollywood,"" McQueen ends up in the town of Radiator Springs, where he needs to perform public service.  Similar to Michael J. Fox's character in ""Doc Hollywood,"" McQueen is arrogant and over-confident.  Fortunately, his experiences with the denizens of Radiator Springs may change his attitude and his life.Radiator Springs is filled with all sorts of characters.  Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) is a former big-city attorney who dreamed of a slower pace and the beauty of the desert.  Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) is an enigmatic character with a secret past.  George Carlin is amusing as Fillmore.  Cheech Marin, Tony Shalhoub and Larry the Cable Guy all voice various characters with their own hopes, dreams and past.The question remains, where does all this lead?  The answer is that it leads to a funny story with a moral hidden behind it all; perhaps more than one moral.I was reluctant to see this movie in the theaters when it came out.  I am not a NASCAR fan and the commercials for this movie seemed to focus too much on the racing aspect of the movie.  Fortunately, while the movie opens and closes with a race, the rest of the movie is about life, and life, just like this movie, should be enjoyed, and there should be humor, which this movie has.This movie is a bit lighter than previous Pixar films.  However, the graphics are phenomenal and the story is easy to follow.  The detail in the scenery and in the machinery continuously amazed me.  Digital animation has come a long way in the last couple of decades and ""Cars"" is contains every technical achievement possible in animation.  I think the kind of animation in ""Cars"" no longer amazes many of us because we have seen it so many times before.  Fortunately, the story is enjoyable and there is reasonably good humor to keep you interested to the end of the movie.  There is a slow spot in the middle of the movie, but the animation fascinated me at that point and I was trying to figure out how this movie might end so that I hardly noticed the slow point.""Cars"" has it all.  Great animation, a reasonably good story, an all-star cast, and humor.  There are a number of inside jokes, most of which I failed to catch.  The movie is also family friendly, even for the youngest members of the family.  This movie will be one that most families will want for their DVD library.Enjoy!",4,Cars Sets a Pace,1162080000,"10 29, 2006",2006,3017,"['Rookie', 'race', 'car', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'voiced', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Rushmore', 'Shanghai', 'Noon', 'Behind', 'Enemy', 'Lines', 'fame', 'finished', 'Piston', 'Cup', 'three-way', 'tie', 'two', 'other', 'cars', 'including', 'King', 'Richard', 'Petty', 'who', 'retiring', 'King', 'leaving', 'position', 'product', 'endorser', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'race', 'three', 'winners', 'ordered', 'determine', 'winner', 'Piston', 'Cup.Lightning', 'McQueen', 'heads', 'California', 'trailer', 'pulled', 'Mack', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'McQueen', 'Mack', 'drive', 'night', 'California', 'Unfortunately', 'Mack', 'asleep', 'McQueen', 'desert', 'Reminiscent', 'Doc', 'Hollywood', 'McQueen', 'up', 'town', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'where', 'perform', 'public', 'service', 'Similar', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'character', 'Doc', 'Hollywood', 'McQueen', 'arrogant', 'over-confident', 'Fortunately', 'experiences', 'denizens', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'may', 'change', 'attitude', 'life.Radiator', 'Springs', 'filled', 'sorts', 'characters', 'Sally', 'Carrera', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'former', 'big-city', 'attorney', 'who', 'dreamed', 'slower', 'pace', 'beauty', 'desert', 'Doc', 'Hudson', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'enigmatic', 'character', 'secret', 'past', 'George', 'Carlin', 'amusing', 'Fillmore', 'Cheech', 'Marin', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'voice', 'various', 'characters', 'own', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'past.The', 'question', 'where', 'lead', 'answer', 'funny', 'story', 'moral', 'hidden', 'perhaps', 'more', 'one', 'moral.I', 'was', 'reluctant', 'see', 'movie', 'theaters', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'am', 'not', 'NASCAR', 'fan', 'commercials', 'movie', 'seemed', 'focus', 'too', 'much', 'racing', 'aspect', 'movie', 'Fortunately', 'movie', 'race', 'rest', 'movie', 'life', 'life', 'just', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'should', 'be', 'humor', 'movie', 'has.This', 'movie', 'bit', 'lighter', 'previous', 'Pixar', 'films', 'However', 'graphics', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'story', 'easy', 'follow', 'detail', 'scenery', 'machinery', 'continuously', 'amazed', 'Digital', 'animation', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'last', 'couple', 'decades', 'Cars', 'contains', 'technical', 'achievement', 'possible', 'animation', 'think', 'kind', 'animation', 'Cars', 'no', 'longer', 'many', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'Fortunately', 'story', 'enjoyable', 'reasonably', 'good', 'humor', 'keep', 'interested', 'end', 'movie', 'slow', 'spot', 'middle', 'movie', 'animation', 'fascinated', 'point', 'was', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'movie', 'might', 'end', 'hardly', 'noticed', 'slow', 'point', 'Cars', 'Great', 'animation', 'reasonably', 'good', 'story', 'all-star', 'cast', 'humor', 'are', 'number', 'inside', 'jokes', 'most', 'failed', 'catch', 'movie', 'also', 'family', 'friendly', 'even', 'youngest', 'members', 'family', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'families', 'will', 'want', 'DVD', 'library.Enjoy']",N/A

The animation is outstanding as usual.  The mega-truckstop at the beginning of the movie showed a perfect example of the fantastic art and culture of the road.  ""Cars"" frames the 'road of life' and lessons old and young souls understand.  Kids will especially enjoy the racing and action scenes.Lightning is in a hurry to get to California for a big race and is traveling cross-country in a semi-truck. A series of accidents happen and Lightning McQueen ends up in a small desert town of Radiator Springs.  It is full of dying businesses because the traffic they depend on has been diverted to a new, faster Interstate.  When the old Route 66 went through, Desert Springs was doing well.  Lightning is arrested for tearing up the road and put in a ""boot"" and impounded.  The rusty old Tow Truck (Mato - short for To-Mato) is voiced over by Larry the Cable Guy.  Mato is friendly, dopey and kind to Lightning.  Lightning only wants to get back to his fast-paced world.The story is somewhat nostalgic for times that were not as pressured.  The reference to Route 66 following the bends and the lay of the land reminds us we need to take time to stop and smell the roses.  Now we have interstates cutting through in straight lines to save a few minutes here and there.  The story flows well and moves fast.  It is a thoughtful, creative movie and highly amusing.All the car characters are well developed and personalities match their make and models.  We have diversity and idiosyncrasy in the mix. There is the romance of the road as well as Lightning McQueen's romance with a sweet and racy Porsche lawyer (Bonnie Hunt).",4,Get Your Kicks Watching Cars on Route 66!,1252108800,"09 5, 2009",2009,1737,"['Owen', 'Wilson', 'friendly', 'voice', 'race', 'car', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'perfect', 'Pixar', 'movie', 'kinds', 'cars', 'animation', 'outstanding', 'usual', 'mega-truckstop', 'beginning', 'movie', 'showed', 'perfect', 'example', 'fantastic', 'art', 'culture', 'road', 'Cars', ""'road"", 'life', 'lessons', 'old', 'young', 'souls', 'understand', 'Kids', 'will', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'racing', 'action', 'scenes.Lightning', 'hurry', 'get', 'California', 'big', 'race', 'traveling', 'cross-country', 'semi-truck', 'series', 'accidents', 'happen', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'up', 'small', 'desert', 'town', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'full', 'dying', 'businesses', 'traffic', 'depend', 'been', 'diverted', 'new', 'faster', 'Interstate', 'When', 'old', 'Route', '66', 'went', 'Desert', 'Springs', 'was', 'doing', 'well', 'Lightning', 'arrested', 'tearing', 'up', 'road', 'put', 'boot', 'impounded', 'rusty', 'old', 'Tow', 'Truck', 'Mato', 'short', 'To-Mato', 'voiced', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'Mato', 'friendly', 'dopey', 'kind', 'Lightning', 'Lightning', 'only', 'get', 'back', 'fast-paced', 'world.The', 'story', 'somewhat', 'nostalgic', 'times', 'were', 'not', 'pressured', 'reference', 'Route', '66', 'following', 'bends', 'lay', 'land', 'need', 'take', 'time', 'stop', 'smell', 'roses', 'Now', 'have', 'interstates', 'cutting', 'straight', 'lines', 'save', 'few', 'minutes', 'here', 'there', 'story', 'well', 'moves', 'fast', 'thoughtful', 'creative', 'movie', 'highly', 'amusing.All', 'car', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'personalities', 'match', 'make', 'models', 'have', 'diversity', 'idiosyncrasy', 'mix', 'romance', 'road', 'as', 'well', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'romance', 'sweet', 'racy', 'Porsche', 'lawyer', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt']",N/A

About winning and losing. About how to win ... and how to lose. It's a message you hear often enough, but usually it's simply an empty truism without much heart. ""It's not if you win or lose, but how you play the game,"" etc., ad nauseum. Cars communicates that message in a genuine, heartfelt way that can't help but reach young and old alike. That, in the end, is what is really good about this film. And, in the end, it's also the most important thing in any movie for children: Do they learn something of lasting value that otherwise might be lost upon them?But, unfortunately, Cars lacks the pacing, vitality, and spirit of Pixar's other films.  The story feels like an early draft that should have been cut and polished -- and cut and polished again. Sequences seem interminable. Points get hashed and rehashed. Movies, especially those for little ones, need to be economical, not bloated. They need to know the point where the length of a scene may destroy its vitality -- and then cut it back way before then. Pixar's done it right so many times, that I've come to take it for granted that its writers are champs at it. Not here.The overwrought nature of the story, coupled with a lack of the adult-oriented (and amusing) subtext that keeps parents interested in the great children's films, makes for a very long ride indeed for folks over forty. In addition, many of the characters seemed like ""cookie cutter"" cliches, something that seemed wholly unnecessary and not exactly a view of the world that's good for tender ears.Maybe Cars, when it reaches the shelves on DVD, will result in a first among director's cuts: a shorter movie.Nah.

The animation is incredible, with canyon landscapes, waterfalls, and highways. And with a great soundtrack, the music montages throughout the film are impeccable.The voices are great. All too often, the names of the cast of these animated movies are much bigger than the actual voice talents. But it's great to hear the voices of Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt, and Larry the Cable Guy (who is hilarious by the way) playing around on screen.And don't forget about the minor characters. It's great seeing stereotype cars such as the hippie van, the army jeep, the sexy Porsche, the old carriage, the German Volkswagen beetle, and many others. Though funny, it's refreshing to see that they didn't center the plot around a silly gag such as stereotyping cars, the way it was advertised.The plot is very simple, a big shot race car learns his lesson by making friends while stuck in a remote town in the middle of nowhere. It's simple, but affective.The only complaint I have with the film is its length. At 2 hours, it certainly seemed to drag.

Now when I heard that a movie about CARS was being made I wondered how can you make a movie out of that? Well, based on Pixar's history, I knew that it would be entertaining and I was right.The movie is a fun and enjoyable film. The CGI is very well done considering that it's hard to design Cars as they have no personality or anything like that. The voices are well cast especially Paul Newman who, in real life, is really a race car driver. Typecasting? Perhaps but he's perfect for his role as a ""washed up"" race car. Of course you also have Pixar stable John Ratzenberger as a truck. Used to be John Goodman. Larry the Cable Guy is hilarious as a redneck rusted tow truck. Owen Wilson as the main character of Lightning McQueen. An egotistical selfish person but lovable nontheless.The moral of the story is basically: Winning isn't everything. There are more important things then winning. And I belive, this being a family film, brings this message across throughout the movie. It's a movie that has heart, laughter, charm,and personality.

634518,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B00005JNS0,Mark Baker,"[0, 1]","Race car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has had a fantastic rookie season and could easily become the first rookie to win the coveted Piston Cup.  All he has to do is win the run off race against veteran The King (Richard Petty) and perpetual runner up Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton).  If he can do that, he might be able to get a new sponsor.  After all, being the spokescar for Rust-Eze is a little embarrassing for a sleek racecar like Lightning.On the way to the big race in Los Angeles, Lightning accidentally gets separated from his transport truck and finds himself in Radiator Springs, where he accidentally destroys the road.  Much to his dismay, he's sentenced to repave the road before he can continue on the way.Radiator Springs is the town that time forgot.  A former way station on the famous Route 66, it is barely surviving now that the big interstate has been build nearby, making stopping there no longer necessary.  Of course, this is exactly the type of town Lightning wants to avoid.  He's living life in the fast lane and just wants to get on his way.But to complete his community service, he has to deal with the locals.  Mater the Tow Truck (Larry the Cable Guy) quickly labels Lightning his best friend and wants to help him have a good time.  Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) is cute and distracts the rather single focused Lightning.  In fact, everyone in town seems to enjoy having Lightning around.  Everyone but Doc Hudson (Paul Newman).  What kind of secret might he have?  And will Lightning take what he is learning to heart?This movie might bore kids.  More so then other Pixar films, the main conflict is internal, focused on what Lightening is learning from his experiences in Radiator Springs.  There is a villain, but he gets little screen time.  And this is the first movie to not have on of Pixar's patented climaxes that will not quit.All this isn't to say that the movie is bad.  I saw it twice in the theater, and loved every minute of it both times.  The story is ultimately heartwarming, the characters endearing, and the movie is funny.  The tractor-tipping scene alone is guaranteed to make you laugh.  Plus there is lots of fun during and after the final credits.And then there's Pixar's attention to detail.  Watching the car's backup lights turn on and off or the bugs being VW Beetles, for example, add to the charm.  The animation in the movie is flawless, and many of the scenery shots are absolutely breathtaking.  If I didn't know better, I would say they were real.  This is a movie to watch on the big screen for those shots alone.Surprisingly, this is the first Pixar film not to get a two disc special edition.  Frankly, I find that disappointing.  Still, the movie looks and sounds wonderful.  There's a new short with Mater, deleted scenes, and the ""One Man Band"" short that showed in theaters before this movie.While kids might not find it as engaging as Pixar's other films, they will enjoy it.  The lack of extras is disappointing, but the film more then makes up for it.

Although the release date was moved from last fall to this summer (not usually a good omen) this seems to have been more a desire for the makers to 'polish the chrome' even more than it already was. With Pixar having such a strong reputation, they needn't rush out their product to compete in the now almost saturated market.Other bad vibes came in the form of the trailers. The teaser was pretty poor, not anything like the great ones for Monsters Inc or The Incredibles (excluding visuals which were enough to get most of our motors revving). Then the first theatrical trailer seemed to pitch the film squarely at 'motor-heads' with some pretty obscure car-based references.Of all of Pixar's films so far, this probably has the least universal appeal, at least on the face of it. I doubt whether many little girls will want to rush and see it (I may be being a little sexist here and I apologise) but this may be made up for with the amount of grown-men that will surely queue around the block.From here on, Pixar are now part of Disney instead of partnered with them and I sincerely hope that Pixar's knowledge rubs off onto Disney's flagging animation department.",5,Pixar's Seventh Heaven?,1149811200,"06 9, 2006",2006,1281,"['So', 'will', 'make', 'Pixar', 'run', 'excellent', 'films', 'seven', 'seven', 'Undoubtably.Early', 'signs', 'however', 'were', 'not', 'good', 'release', 'date', 'was', 'moved', 'last', 'fall', 'summer', 'not', 'usually', 'good', 'omen', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'desire', 'makers', ""'polish"", 'chrome', 'even', 'more', 'already', 'was', 'Pixar', 'having', 'such', 'strong', 'reputation', 'need', ""n't"", 'rush', 'out', 'product', 'compete', 'now', 'almost', 'saturated', 'market.Other', 'bad', 'vibes', 'came', 'form', 'trailers', 'teaser', 'was', 'pretty', 'poor', 'not', 'anything', 'great', 'ones', 'Monsters', 'Inc', 'Incredibles', 'excluding', 'visuals', 'were', 'enough', 'get', 'most', 'motors', 'revving', 'Then', 'first', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'seemed', 'pitch', 'film', 'squarely', ""'motor-heads"", 'pretty', 'obscure', 'car-based', 'references.Of', 'Pixar', 'films', 'so', 'far', 'probably', 'least', 'universal', 'appeal', 'least', 'face', 'doubt', 'many', 'little', 'girls', 'will', 'want', 'rush', 'see', 'may', 'be', 'being', 'little', 'sexist', 'here', 'apologise', 'may', 'be', 'made', 'up', 'amount', 'grown-men', 'will', 'surely', 'queue', 'block.From', 'here', 'Pixar', 'are', 'now', 'part', 'Disney', 'instead', 'partnered', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'Pixar', 'knowledge', 'rubs', 'off', 'Disney', 'flagging', 'animation', 'department']",N/A

Partially because I was annoyed that Pixar was bought out by Disney and the fact my girl is noise sensitive and would have gotten upset over the race scenes and the noise involved.While getting a haircut for her, they had it playing.  I decided to buy it after she was done.As typical to Pixar it's a great story about about a self absorbed up and coming race car named Lightning McQueen (named after Steve McQueen).Lightning thinks he can do everything by himself and it comes back on him as he ignores advice and ends up in a 3-way tie in a race he should have won.  He has to head out to California for a race off between the 3 winners and eventually gets lost and ends up on the forgotten roads of Route 66.  He panics and ends up destroying the streets of the forgotten town of Radiator Springs.  He is caught and his punishment is to repair the roads.There he finds many characters.  Doc Hudson (Paul Neuman) who may have a secret past, Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) the simple happy go lucky tow truck, and of course a nice Girl Porsche Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) who is a dreamer and longs for what the town used to be.Along the way Lightning makes friends with the town people.  Mater being the best friend.  He helps the improve itself and they help him start thinking about other people.The movie has a well rounded cast with the efforts of Tony Shalhoub, Cheeh marin, John Ratzenburger, Michel Keaton, George Carlin, and cameos by others.There are two shorts, One Man Band and Mater and the Ghostlight.  I lost count on how many times my girl had to watch them!There are deleted scenes which are drawing form.There is a short by John Lasseter called Inspiration For Cars.

Insightful and delightful, the film offers up the coming-of-age of Lightning McQueen, the rookie racecar that's tearing up the tracks and hot on the trail of the magnificent Piston Cup.  However, Lightning manages to derail himself by alienating his pit crew and talking his truck transport into driving all night and getting him lost in the middle of the desert somewhere along Route 66, the highway that used to be the byway to the western United States.  But that's where the story begins.  Lightning has to make restitution for tearing up the town, and along the way he ends up making friends that enrich and give meaning to his life.Pixar Studios is absolutely the crown jewel of the animated studios.  A lot of new faces are showing up in that market, but no one else even comes close to what Pixar can serve up.  Beginning with TOY STORY and moving through MONSTERS, INC., A BUG'S LIFE (which are lampooned in the end credits of CARS) and including the INCREDIBLES, Pixar has held unchallenged sway over animated movies.CARS has one of the oldest plots in storytelling.  Young upstart with the world by the tail gets taught a new lesson about the real meaning of life.  Scores of movies have used that as their baseline to tell a tale.  Yet, somehow -- probably because Pixar is just filled with magic, CARS pulls off an exciting feel-good reindition of what is probably the most hackneyed of plots.  Owen Wilson stars as the voice of Lightning, Paul Newman as Doc, Bonnie Hunt as Sally, Larry the Cable Guy as Mater, Cheech Marin as Ramon, Michael Keaton as Chick Hicks and Richard Petty as the King.  All of the characters were great.  The world invented in this movie, where cars with personalities exist but people don't, comes across realistically portrayed (given the circumstances -- and viewers have to wonder where little cars come from and how they got invented).  The tractor tipping sequence Mater takes Lightning on is a hoot.This movie is a must out there in the theaters.  Children and adults will have a great time.  The only thing that's going to be better will be the DVD with all the special features showing how Pixar wove their latest magic spell.",4,All Revved Up!,1149811200,"06 9, 2006",2006,2244,"['CARS', 'going', 'be', 'feather', 'Pixar', 'feather-studded', 'hat', 'Insightful', 'delightful', 'film', 'up', 'coming-of-age', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'rookie', 'racecar', 'tearing', 'up', 'tracks', 'hot', 'trail', 'magnificent', 'Piston', 'Cup', 'However', 'Lightning', 'manages', 'derail', 'alienating', 'pit', 'crew', 'talking', 'truck', 'transport', 'driving', 'night', 'getting', 'lost', 'middle', 'desert', 'somewhere', 'along', 'Route', '66', 'highway', 'used', 'be', 'byway', 'western', 'United', 'States', 'where', 'story', 'Lightning', 'make', 'restitution', 'tearing', 'up', 'town', 'way', 'up', 'making', 'friends', 'enrich', 'give', 'meaning', 'life.Pixar', 'Studios', 'absolutely', 'crown', 'jewel', 'animated', 'studios', 'lot', 'new', 'are', 'showing', 'up', 'market', 'one', 'else', 'even', 'close', 'what', 'Pixar', 'can', 'serve', 'up', 'Beginning', 'TOY', 'STORY', 'moving', 'MONSTERS', 'INC.', 'A', 'BUG', 'LIFE', 'are', 'lampooned', 'end', 'credits', 'CARS', 'including', 'INCREDIBLES', 'Pixar', 'held', 'unchallenged', 'sway', 'animated', 'movies.CARS', 'one', 'oldest', 'plots', 'storytelling', 'Young', 'upstart', 'world', 'tail', 'taught', 'new', 'lesson', 'real', 'meaning', 'life', 'Scores', 'movies', 'have', 'used', 'baseline', 'tell', 'tale', 'somehow', 'probably', 'Pixar', 'just', 'filled', 'magic', 'CARS', 'off', 'exciting', 'feel-good', 'reindition', 'what', 'probably', 'most', 'hackneyed', 'plots', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'voice', 'Lightning', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Doc', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'Sally', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'Mater', 'Cheech', 'Marin', 'Ramon', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Chick', 'Hicks', 'Richard', 'Petty', 'King', 'characters', 'were', 'great', 'world', 'invented', 'movie', 'where', 'cars', 'personalities', 'exist', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'realistically', 'portrayed', 'given', 'circumstances', 'viewers', 'have', 'wonder', 'where', 'little', 'cars', 'come', 'how', 'got', 'invented', 'tractor', 'tipping', 'sequence', 'Mater', 'Lightning', 'hoot.This', 'movie', 'must', 'out', 'there', 'theaters', 'Children', 'adults', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'only', 'thing', 'going', 'be', 'better', 'will', 'be', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'showing', 'how', 'Pixar', 'wove', 'latest', 'magic', 'spell']",N/A

So, its fun to watch Cars, which follows the more traditional story of a hot shot car who learns the value of a little town life.  The characters are great, mader especially is funny, and the movie makes clever use of the car world.  Everything is car related, from cattle to the bugs (watch closely and you'll see).

I wasn't sure I was going to like it, because it was 'cartoon' and that's not my favorite type of movie to watch, but I've enjoyed Pixar creations in the past, so I figured I'd give it a try, and my kids really wanted to go. When it was over, I wanted to watch it again, because I missed so much of it the first time--from laughing!When ""Jr."" came out, who happens to be the driver my ex loved the most, I was laughing so hard I couldn't see! The comparison to real life celebrities, racers, and past celebrities was simply brilliant. There is great humor here along with some innuendo that made it fun for grown ups and kids alike. It's fast paced enough that there's not a lot of down time from one belly laugh to the next... and if you have ever been on a farm or know about cow-tipping, the tractor tipping scene is going to have you rolling on the floor!My son was laughing so hard in parts he couldn't catch his breath.I highly recommend this as a family movie that both children and adults will love.

634543,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JNS0,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[2, 11]","The courtship between the Walt Disney Corporation and Pixar Animation Studios has been at best a tumultuous one to say the least about it. Former-Disney Chairman/CEO Michael Eisner deserves most of the blame however. He and Steve Jobs, Chairman/CEO of Pixar Animation Studios, were at each other's throats throughout their nearly decade long partnership together. Even after the astonishing break-out success of honorary Oscar recipient Toy Story in 1995, Eisner had yet to be convinced of Pixar's potential. Rather then buy Pixar straight-out, which would have been the smart and economically efficient thing to do, Disney instead negotiated to extend their three-picture distribution deal to five movies. Things became even direr after Disney theatrically released Toy Story 2 in 1999 which had been originally produced with the intention of it premiering direct-to-video. Pixar believed it should count as part of their five-picture deal with Disney but Eisner argued that it was negotiated outside of their contract and did not count. Disney's efforts to (no pun intended) drown Finding Nemo in the midst of the summer season, which failed miserably as it went on to become the highest grossing animated film of all time, surpassing The Lion King, further emboldened Jobs to seek a corporate divorce, if only to rid himself of Michael Eisner. Disaster was averted however when Michael Eisner chose, forcefully or not, to step down from his position aboard the Walt Disney Company allowing his replacement, Robert Iger, to woe Pixar back to Disney. With Eisner now out of the picture, Jobs, with no contention against the Disney Corporation anymore, agreed to sell the animation giant to the company for seven-billion dollars, far more then it would have been had Eisner chosen to buy them out ten years ago.The story for Cars can easily be identified as the source of the movie's problems but precisely pinpointing the exact cause is a bit more difficult. While there is nothing particularly wrong with it per say - it is sweet and well meaning - it comes off as being far too generic. This is the exact same predicament the Brad Bird directed Pixar project, The Incredibles, was faced with two years ago. However, The Incredibles was in the end still able to be overtly entertaining in spite of this tremendous handicap. Cars, on the other hand, is not nearly as successful as its predecessor was. Time is not a factor, at least not on its face. Cars' one-hundred and fourteen minute time-length is on par with the running time for The Incredibles and yet Cars is the one that feels more drawn out. Lightning's trip to California, for example. While it does successfully `show off' Pixar's artistic prowess (emphasis added), it does nothing to better accommodate the flow of the story. Instead it smacks of pride and daresay smugness on the part of Pixar Animation and should have been shortened down. Even Lightning's community service sentence in Radiator Springs feels force fed. That said however Rascal Flatts' version of `Life is a Highway' is put to expedient use in this scene. And then unlike past Pixar films there is no distinctive villain to help chart the path of the film's protagonist. But then again this fails to explain Finding Nemo's success in terms of plot and character development. Regardless of what the true source of the problems is, Cars in spite of foreseeable plot devices still remains a cut above the rest of the mainstream box office.The decision to cast comedic-actor Owen Wilson as the lead in Disney/Pixar's Cars did not bring quite the level of anticipation or enthusiasm as Craig T. Nelson for The Incredibles or Albert Brooks in Finding Nemo had in their respected roles. In spite of his fairly consistent appearance in such artistic independent films as The Life Aquatic and The Royal Tenenbaums for director Wes Anderson, Wilson is judged mostly on his more frequent appearance in low-level comedies like Shanghai Knights, Zoolander, Starsky and Hutch, and Wedding Crashers which make the choice to cast him as the lead in a Pixar film a bit odd. Slowly but surely Wilson proves he is up to the challenge. Furthermore, there is more to the character makeup of Lightening McQueen then what lies on the surface. French political philosopher and historian Alexis de Tocqueville in his famous political analysis Democracy in America warned of the greatest threat facing the newborn nation America and its principles of liberty, freedom and democracy - individualism. Not the rugged individualism which vastly shaped this nation's western frontier throughout the 1800s but rather the individualism which leads people only to think of themselves and withdraw further from the community at large. It is the kind of `no-fault freedom' Senator Rick Santorum describes in his book It Takes a Family as the ability to ""check out from the pursuit of the common good and to do what feels right for me, without regard to those around me"". It is a bit of stretch, true, to go from discussing high-level political-science canon to a children's film about a world entirely inhabited by living, breathing cars. Regardless, the basic principle remains the same. Younger children will likely not pick up on the social-political implications of the message this film expresses just yet, maybe a few years down the road - if they are being educated properly, but adults will. Their embrace of the film and its message will make all the difference.Cars will likely be one of the last, if not THE last, films for fellow car enthusiast and acting legend Paul Newman (Cool Hand Luke, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid). He definitely goes out in style as the abrupt doctor of a simple town who hides a secret past. Say what you want about Larry the Cable Guy, even ardent fans would agree that his feature film debut, Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector, was a bit of an embarrassment, but there's no denying the fact that he steals the show with his hick antics as Mater which is just like ""tuh-mater, but without the `tuh'"".Few will likely notice without examining the cast list first that Michael Keaton (Batman, Mr. Mom, White Noise, Herbie: Fully Loaded, etc.) is the voice of the quasi-villain, or as close to a villain as the film gets, Chick Hicks. Kudos both to the casting director and especially to Keaton himself who disguises his voice brilliantly in order to create a rather suspicious character.And hearing Formula One-winner Michael Schumacher as well as NASCAR legends Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Mario Andretti, Darrell Waltrip, and Richard Petty, along with his wife, Lynda, provide the voices of their motor-vehicle counterparts in the film is definitely a surprising added bonus. Even car enthusiast/late-night talk-show host Jay Leno gets in on the act making a very brief cameo as Jay Limo early in the movie.Overall, Cars, the seventh computer-animated project from the creative and talented folks at Pixar Animation Studios, not to mention their very last film before the Disney buyout, is sadly their worst to date. This is more of an insult to the movie industry overall however. Even on their worst day Pixar still manages to produce a product that is superior then the majority of what is out in the market right now - animated or otherwise. Optimistically, it's about average. While some pessimists will be quick to label Cars as a step backward for the company and ultimately a failure, alternatively it can be said that director John Lassester, intentionally or not, successfully reintroduces the basic storytelling principles and heart which he himself installed in the company with Toy Story and A Bug's Life in 1995 and 1998 respectively as it makes the transition from an independent entity into another cog in the Disney machine. It is difficult to pin down precisely what is wrong with this film. For one it felt as the though the level of anticipation for this film was no where near as high as it should have been for a Pixar release in summer when everyone is out of school. Marketing may be to blame for dropping the ball on this one, at least in part. Cars was sold too much to the male-driven (no pun intended) NASCAR crowd that it practically alienated the female demographic. That said however it is not entirely marketing's fault. While it is not beyond reason to believe that children or even some adults for that matter may wonder what toys do when humans are not around or whether fish and bugs talk, it is quite a stretch to believe that someone out there truly wants to know what the world would be like if it was entirely inhabited by cars. And unlike fish, toys, monsters, and, yes, even bugs, cars are just not cuddly. It is therefore practically impossible to sell a love story to young girls when it is between two cold pieces of metal, essentially. In addition there is nothing in Cars - visually or otherwise - that really sticks out in your mind when you leave the theatre. Sure, the scene with Mater and Lighting sneaking into the field to go `tractor tipping' is cute and all but it's nothing compared to the scene in Finding Nemo with Dory speaking whale or Mike and Sulley `practicing' for the company musical called `Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me' from Monsters, Inc. Not to be so negative about Cars, there are some bright spots. Randy Newman returns to Pixar in top form with an incredible accompanying musical score. And the soundtrack to the film has to be one of the best in the studios' history. It features excellent new additions like Sheryl Crow's `Real Gone' and `Find Yourself' from country artist Brad Paisley as well as some classic tunes like `Route 66' performed by Chuck Berry and Rascal Flatts' version of `Life is a Highway'. Cars is no where near the disaster some had predicted it would be but neither is it the best we could have hoped for.",4,The Moose Hole - Life is a Highway,1155427200,"08 13,

They are an always-in-evolution machine, capable of providing us with the most unimaginable but amazing stories. Every Pixar movie is an exercise in universe creation, and Cars is not an exception.This is a world populated entirely by automobiles. No drivers, passengers or people; their windshields are eyes, their grills are mouths.The protagonist is a hotshot rookie race car named Lightning McQueen, an arrogant who thinks he doesn't need anyone but himself to conquer the world (and some trophy called The Piston Cup). With him, we get very early, that this is the story of how McQueen will learn what's really important in life.""Cars"" is about enjoying the journey, not getting fast to the destination.While McQueen is on his way to the final showdown in California, he gets lost and ends up in the small town of Radiator Springs where he gets sentenced to community service. Eventually, the hotshot befriends the ""weird"" locals, who will teach him exactly what he needs to learn; the importance of having friends to support you, the loveliness and charm of small-town values and the most important one: how shallow and meaningless are the notions of fame and prestige.That a coveted trophy is -after all- ""just an empty cup"".Cars have that Pixar/Disney charm and good vibe, but it doesn't capture the emotional resonance offered in their past films. The animation looks amazing, showing us how vast and unforgettable the world can be. It's good and it entertains. It has heart and spunk. But it's just not enough.

634551,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JNS0,mirasreviews,"[6, 12]","""Cars"" is director John Lasseter's tribute to American automobile culture. It rolls his love of NASCAR and fondness for the family road trip into a children's morality tale with a little history lesson. The world of ""Cars"" is a populated by driverless autos, so the characters are all machines. A hotshot, rookie racing car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) who thinks of nothing but winning the Piston Cup has one week to get to his race in California. But a mishap en route lands McQueen in traffic court in the southwestern town of Radiator Springs. The town judge, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), wants the arrogant little racer out of town ASAP, but Porsche prosecutor Sally (Bonnie  Hunt) wants McQueen to pave the town's dilapidated main thoroughfare instead, in hopes that it will bring travelers back to the Route 66 town that they abandoned when the interstate was put through. McQueen is loathe to miss his race, but the townsfolk and a hillbilly tow truck named Mater (Dan Whitney) may change his priorities.""Cars"" is an attractive film that smoothly integrates two aspects of car culture -racing and road trips- into a lesson about friendship and respect and a little history of Route 66 towns. But the script is pedestrian. It's hard to believe that someone thought a bunch of bickering over paving a road would be entertaining. You can tune out large sections of this movie without missing anything. ""Cars"" has a lot of technically impressive animation but really only engages visually at the racetrack. It opens with a bang as cars whiz around the track at the Piston Cup and closes in the same vein, with the tiebreaker race, which is much more involving. I can't say if children would enjoy ""Cars"", but, at 1 hour and 54 minutes, it is tedious and way too long. Since ""Finding Nemo"", Pixar has lost its flare for clever dialogue and distinctive animation that adults can enjoy too. To my mind, if a film is too dull for adults, its' not worth a child's time either. Pixar needs better writers.The DVD (Pixar 2006): Bonus features include 2 animated short films, 4 deleted scenes, the movie's epilogue, and a documentary about the inspiration behind the film. ""Mater and the Ghostlight"" (7 min) is a short film in which Mater gets his comeuppance for playing practical jokes. ""One Man Band' (4 1/2 min) is a short film unrelated to ""'Cars"", in which a couple of street musicians duel for the approval of a little girl. ""Epilogue"" (4 min) is the last part of ""Cars"" that played over the credits. In ""Inspiration for Cars"" (16 min), John Lasseter talks about merging the worlds of racing and road trips, the decline of Route 66, and shares part of the Route 66 road trip that the filmmakers took with ""Route 66: The Mother Road"" author Michael Wallis.

The movie is nothing but utter foolishness.The dialogues are unduly long and filled with unnecessary stories that only belong to the class of senile auto mechanics. The extravagant animation and motion, compounded by complicated dialogues, compounded by bizarre characterization of cars as humans; using bathrooms, having emotions, and making plots, all made sitting and watching a mad theater screen any thing but entertaining. Cars giving fives, messaging each other, expressing every human emotion, without humans, each one would have been funny and entertaining by itself, but the madness of mixing the action of animation and motion was overlapped by the madness of the many characters given to many car models.I could not tell why such an empty animation game made it to the big screen. There are plenty of folks who enjoy squandering their life in watching animation games, but a movie must make a point. Here, there were many points on many fronts. The animation art and motion were truly challenging. The Italian automobile technology challenging the American technology was overlapped by two colliding cultures, accents, and tales.

Everybody's looking for a way to get real gone""If you think this is a kid's movie.  You're right.  But it has a story that may hit home for many adults.  I won't spoil the ending, but it made me more emotional than I saw coming.You might expect that a movie about shiny talking race cars will have an exciting, come-from-behind, nearly-impossible victory for the hero in the end.  But this movie is disarmingly smart, so you'll have to wait and see.The movie shows us that sometimes life genuinely surprises us.  And some people have trouble moving forward if people they care about are not able to finish strong.  Some people, including both of the main characters Lightning McQueen & Sally Carrera, don't believe they can ""win"" if they have left other members of their community behind.It's a racing movie that suggests finishing well is not primarily dependent on how fast you can go on the straight-a-ways, or how much you can dominate your competitors.  To finish well, you must learn how to coordinate the curves, consider others, and sometimes completely fail and go backwards.Why do we go backwards?  We don't do it primarily for others.  We don't do it for primarliy selfish reasons.

634580,AHF97M45JFCB,B00005JNS0,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","I don't know about you but when I think of Pixar's ""classics"" rarely is Cars the first to come to mind.  The Toy Story(s) perhaps, Monsters Inc. maybe, even Finding Nemo for those so inclined and yet it took a under-whelming sequel followed by a revisit to the DVD I thought I knew well to realize that the first Cars is the epitome of all that Pixar has come to mean to modern animation.In the event that you've been living in a cave these past six years, Cars tells of a racecar sidetracked by fate on his way to The Big Race in California.  Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), a brash NASCAR rookie who unwittingly gets lost and ends up in Radiator Springs, an almost-ghost town and former hot spot along historic Route 66, now ignored by tourists and travelers alike, thanks to the superhighway that bypasses the town.In the process of arriving, McQueen inadvertently tears up the asphalt of Main Street.  He gets arrested and is sentenced, against will and ego, to repave the damaged street.While paying his debt to society, McQueen encounters a 1951 Hudson Hornet, a rusty but lovable tow truck, a hippy 1960 VW bus, a classy but confident Porsche and a herd of tractors prone to tipping over and fluctuating exhaust fumes out of fright.The racing action certainly gets its due to be sure and kids have proven that a ragtag group of vehicles with eyes behind their windshields works just fine as toys, school folders, and backpacks.  But it is John Lasseter's underlying message that couldn't be clearer here: Pay attention to what matters: family, friends, true love, and it doesn't hurt to appreciate cars either.NASCAR-fans had much to celebrate, as did car-racing aficionados of all disciplines for that matter but it's the nostalgia of society's collective switch in thinking (from the scenery of iconic Route 66 being traded for the efficiency of the superhighway) that I found most prolific this time around.Even though 2006 might as well be eons ago in the ever-advancing world of computer animating technology, the visuals in Cars still manage to impress (especially in high-definition); a fact perhaps further enhanced by the abundance of heart within the prose.In all, and contrary to the trend that Pixar just continues to outdo itself in each subsequent effort, it is almost ironic that having watched the lackluster sequel in the theater led me back to the original and of course to rediscovering the charms that separate the good films from the great ones.",4,Still Charming Half a Decade Later,1314748800,"08 31, 2011",2011,2484,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'think', 'Pixar', 'classics', 'rarely', 'Cars', 'first', 'come', 'mind', 'Toy', 'Story', 'perhaps', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'maybe', 'even', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'so', 'inclined', 'yet', 'took', 'under-whelming', 'sequel', 'followed', 'revisit', 'DVD', 'thought', 'knew', 'well', 'realize', 'first', 'Cars', 'epitome', 'Pixar', 'come', 'mean', 'modern', 'event', ""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'cave', 'six', 'years', 'Cars', 'racecar', 'sidetracked', 'fate', 'way', 'Big', 'Race', 'California', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'voiced', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'brash', 'NASCAR', 'rookie', 'who', 'unwittingly', 'lost', 'up', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'almost-ghost', 'town', 'former', 'hot', 'spot', 'historic', 'Route', '66', 'now', 'ignored', 'tourists', 'travelers', 'alike', 'thanks', 'superhighway', 'town.In', 'process', 'arriving', 'McQueen', 'inadvertently', 'up', 'asphalt', 'Main', 'Street', 'arrested', 'sentenced', 'will', 'ego', 'repave', 'damaged', 'street.While', 'paying', 'debt', 'society', 'McQueen', '1951', 'Hudson', 'Hornet', 'rusty', 'lovable', 'tow', 'truck', 'hippy', '1960', 'VW', 'bus', 'classy', 'confident', 'Porsche', 'herd', 'tractors', 'prone', 'tipping', 'fluctuating', 'exhaust', 'fumes', 'fright.The', 'racing', 'action', 'certainly', 'due', 'be', 'sure', 'kids', 'have', 'proven', 'ragtag', 'group', 'vehicles', 'eyes', 'windshields', 'just', 'fine', 'toys', 'school', 'folders', 'backpacks', 'John', 'Lasseter', 'underlying', 'message', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'clearer', 'here', 'Pay', 'attention', 'what', 'matters', 'family', 'friends', 'true', 'love', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'appreciate', 'cars', 'either.NASCAR-fans', 'had', 'much', 'celebrate', 'did', 'car-racing', 'aficionados', 'disciplines', 'matter', 'nostalgia', 'society', 'collective', 'switch', 'thinking', 'scenery', 'iconic', 'Route', '66', 'being', 'traded', 'efficiency', 'superhighway', 'found', 'most', 'prolific', 'time', 'around.Even', '2006', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'eons', 'ago', 'ever-advancing', 'world', 'computer', 'animating', 'technology', 'visuals', 'Cars', 'still', 'manage', 'impress', 'especially', 'high-definition', 'fact', 'perhaps', 'further', 'enhanced', 'abundance', 'heart', 'prose.In', 'contrary', 'trend', 'Pixar', 'just', 'outdo', 'subsequent', 'effort', 'almost', 'ironic', 'having', 'watched', 'lackluster', 'sequel', 'theater', 'led', 'back', 'original', 'course', 'rediscovering', 'charms', 'separate', 'good', 'films', 'great', 'ones']",N/A

From A Bug's Life to The Incredibles, the teasers usually left me groaining, thinking of inevitable disaster.  But every single time I saw the actual FILMS, I would be surprised, relieved, and overall GIDDY with happiness from the Quality of Work PIXAR puts into its films.SO when I saw the Cars Teaser in November before seeing The Incredibles, I actually was impressed and now wait dearly for the upcoming film, because when six films out of six films made from PIXAR are MEGA-BOX OFFICE HITS, as well as Oscar Winners . . . then its future films are bound to be great, if not PERFECT!I give this film 5 out of 5 for now . . . out of sheer precedence . . . but I doubt that I'll change it in the coming months!---And now it is August 2006, and I have seen Cars and given it a lot of thought.  While it may not be MY favorite PIXAR film to date, Cars remains an amazing film in all aspects, and it further shows how hard work & commitment really help in making a great film (Heck, it's the ONLY way!).This film prefectly captures the spirit of a road trip.  I may be off the edge here, but one of my favorite moments of the film was actually in the beginning, during the ""Life is a Highway"" Scene.  The very animation is stunning, and it throws me back in a time when I was but a wee child looking out my side window and seeing all those fields go by.  Honestly, I haven't been bored in a car since watching this movie.  That Road Trip vibe just keeps reappearing, even if I only travel to the supermarket!!One thing I do have to say, this DVD is NOT up to par.  Sure, the Movie is Awesome, and We'll get two shorts and the teaser to Ratatouille, but after that, it's just a few deleted scenes & ONE Featurette!!  This is seriously skimping out on the traditional PIXAR DVD, where two discs will give you tons of Bonus, too many to list (ALONGSIDE hundreds of little Easter Eggs).  Many of the PIXAR DVDs out even include BOTH formats.  Why this sudden change in tradtion?  Aside from a possible Disney-initiated ""Double Dipping,"" I really have no idea.  This is a great film, the DVD should be JUST as great.I'll still give this Film & DVD five stars.

I felt they were going to start to slip when they released The Incredibles and I thought it was just another superhero movie, when it turned out to be an exploration of discovering your identity and knowing who you are and what you can do.  Then I thought Cars looked kind of uninteresting and reviews that called it derivative didn't help.  However, though this movie may be a bit derivative, it still is a huge helping of Pixar heart.Everything about this movie exceeded my expectations.  I thought I'd hate the characters, especially Lightning and Mader because Lightning is selfish and Mader is voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, but I ended up really liking both (and all of the other characters too).  I didn't believe Pixar could have made their animation even more stunning, but they did, both with high technological neon lighting animation and gorgeous natural vistas.  Heck, I thought the movie would feel preachy, but it still feels very caring.It's also a slight return to form after the Incredibles in that it returns to homages of cinema past and tie-ins to other Pixar works, something that is both fun to look for and shows how much the crew working at Pixar really love their job.

Even the flies were tiny VW bugs. The animation was so crisp and clean that during the race at the beginning of the movie, some of the racing segments looked like real cars zooming around the track.The storyline is simple, yet quite relevant in this day and age of superstar athletes and the hunger for fame. Lightning, forced to serve community service in a forgotten town called Radiator Springs, ultimately learns that it's more important to be a champion on the inside, rather than on the outside with trophies and titles.I actually didn't expect the movie to end the way it did, but after a bit I was glad for the way it ended. A very strange side effect of seeing this movie in the theater was that on my way home, I kept seeing cars as humanlike, rather than strictly machinery.

Main character is Lightning McQueen, a beautiful little spoiled racing car too vain of his own early success to see beyond his own unexperience. Too proud and sure of himself to rely on others' advice, and believing that he would never be in need of anyone else. When he accidentally falls off the truck that was taking him to California to participate in the Piston Racing Coup, he finds himself on his own in an unknown place. Lost and alone he gets to Radiator Springs, a long-ago forgotten community struggling to stay in business nevertheless no big roads or highways pass nearby. A bunch of colorful guys there, with engines and parts perhaps not so brand-new and shiny but with certainly far more experience will eventually make him value all those meaningful and important things that go far beyond the mere outside looks and efervescent success: friendship, companionship, experience, and love....And plus: what a soundtrack! Rascal Flatts' version of ""Life is a highway"" got me rocking all the way home after the movie theater... These guys are just purely and plainly great and make unbelievable music, even when remaking a new version of this famous 80's tune. I love them. Sheryl Crow's ""Real Gone"" opening theme rocks!

634626,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JNS0,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 8]","Cars (John Lasseter,2006)The main problem I have with Cars will not be shared by the majority of its viewers, nor even the majority of Americans. It's the naked end result of a love affair with NASCAR, and all NASCAR represents. Still, if anyone can take NASCAR and make it worth watching, it's Pixar. And they do a relatively good job of it, despite the instant-death casting moves of putting Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy (are you getting the ""all NASCAR represents"" vibe yet?) in two major roles.Cars is the story of Lightning McQueen (Wilson), a self-absorbed rookie racer who overcomes overwhelming obstacles to finish in a three-way tie for the Piston Cup, racing's greatest honor. (That he put himself in the position to be burdened with overwhelming obstacles is a minor, but important, point.) The talking heads decree that The three finishers-- McQueen, The King (Richard Petty), and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton)-- will have a race-off in California in one week. On the way there, thanks to various shenannigans, McQueen finds himself stranded in the town of Radiator Springs, having caused a great deal of damage to the stretch of Route 66 that passes through the town. The town judge, Doc (Paul Newman), sentences McQueen to repave the section of road he destroyed. Which, of course, leads to McQueen getting to know the locals and coming to care about something other than his own existence. Roll credits, another happy ending in the books.So, yeah, it's predictable. But the predictability doesn't take into account the Pixar magic, which flows as strongly as ever here. And I mean strong-- if it can make me like anything even remotely NASCAR-related (or Larry the Cable Guy related), there's some serious mojo workin' in the Pixar studios.It's not much of a surprise that Cars works as well as it does; Lasseter was the guy behind both Toy Story movies and A Bug's Life, three of Pixar's strongest offerings. He uses the same formula here: lovely animation with a great deal of subtle detail to captivate the eye, fantastic voice casting for minor roles (and little details added by those voice actors that brighten everything up a bunch), and realizing that if you're going to do formula, the best way to do it is to stick with the formula.

However, film producers recognized that this project wouldn't have even made it out of the garage were it a corporate vehicle for Chevron. Instead, animation provides backdrop for a genuinely compelling coming-of-age story.Thinking of himself as hot stuff, Lightning McQueen is initially mortified by the judge's final sentence. Upon the recommendation of Sally, he gets ordered to stay and make amends for the street which he had destroyed--however accidentally--in his rush out to California. What was 'nothing' to him is home to these cars.Lightning is initially dismissive both of the town and its residents--convinced they cannot teach him anything.However, subsequently being bested by Doc in another race then takes him down a notch. For a 'family' movie, 'Cars' also contains very powerful and ever-relevant sociopolitical critiques of how highway expansion ultimately damages communities; Lightning discovers this ' helpful innovation' actually choked off the town's once vibrant tourist industry--killing their economy in the process.He also learns that the now-elderly Doc was once just like himself. This too adds depth to the movie. Despite the graying of America, we remain a very youth-obessed culture.  Contrasting with other nations, anything perceived to do with the elderly still gets perceived as `worn', `outdated' and `inferior'.Finally making it out to California, Lightning is surprised to find himself repeatedly thinking about Radiator Springs. Discovering that his new friends came to cheer him on, he is heartened. Although he does not win that coveted race, he does win the race of car life. A wiser Lightning returns to help revitalize Radiator Springs--in the tradition of all great movie heroes.In other words, it's not the typical `family fluff' which shies away from discussing anything substantive.

Zwick,"[2, 3]","***1/2So who needs an opposable thumb when you can have a technologically advanced civilization built and inhabited by nothing but cars, trucks, vans and a whole host of other automotive vehicles?  ""Cars,"" the latest hit from Pixar Animation, presents a world entirely devoid of people but still replete with all the architecture, history and pop culture references we associate with human beings.  It's an intriguing concept, and one which the skilled animators bring to remarkable life on screen.  The vehicles that make up the cast of characters have been beautifully anthropomorphized without betraying their basic nature as transportation devices.  It's certainly a great deal easier for animators to imbue living creatures with human qualities than it is to do the same with automobiles, so the filmmakers are definitely to be commended for their stunning work in this movie (the breakthrough here is in putting the ""eyes"" in the dashboard rather than in the headlights, which gives the cars a friendlier, more expressive countenance than we are used to in animated-car tales).Owen Wilson voices the main character, Lightning McQueen, a self-absorbed, cherry-red racecar whose sole concern in life is to win the Piston Cup so he can bask in the glow of fame and fortune and rustle himself up a higher class of products to endorse.  While he's on his way to California for the Big Race, Lightning finds himself stranded in a small desert community named Radiator Springs - situated on old Route 66 - that lost all its business when the big interstate highway opened up a few miles outside of town.  The film is a sweet lament for a bygone era when crossing the country was a more laid-back affair and travelers were able to experience the joys of small town life on the way to their destinations.  It is in Radiator Springs that the cocky Lightning learns a thing or two from the townsfolk about what is really important in life (and it isn`t winning the big race).The town is filled with more quirky eccentrics than one would find in any low budget, independent feature shown at the Sundance Film Festival.  There's Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), the town`s medic and judge, who seems to be harboring a deep, dark secret about his past from the rest of the world; Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), a bucktoothed tow truck who's none too gifted in the brains department but who is sweet-tempered and good-natured and who becomes Lightning's most devoted follower in the town; Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), the sexy young Porsche who fled the rat race of civilization to make her home in Radiator Springs and who becomes the inevitable love interest for our hard-charging, drag racing Romeo.  There's also an assortment of ethnic types with thick accents to flesh out the scene and indicate what a melting pot even an America made up entirely of motor vehicles would be.  A large number of well-known voices populate the film, including Cheech Marin, George Carlin, Michael Keaton, Jeremy Piven, Jay Leno, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Billy Crystal, John Goodman.  You name it - just about anyone who's anyone in Hollywood shows up in this movie.  Heck, even racing legends Richard Petty, Mario Andretti and Dale Earnhardt Jr. make an appearance here.It goes without saying that the color and animation are truly top drawer and state-of-the-art (this IS a Pixar product, after all), but, for all its richness of image and humor, ""Cars"" seems to be missing that extra added something that would secure it a place in the pantheon of great animated features.  Perhaps, there is a certain sameness built into the concept of having only animated vehicles as characters that makes the movie wear a bit thin after awhile.  Perhaps, too, the narrative needs a trifle more energy and ""drive"" (pardon the pun), a higher octane fuel that would make it speed along at a faster clip.  Lighting is stuck in this town for so long a spell that we begin to feel a little bit stuck there ourselves.  For a movie built entirely on driving, ""Cars"" is surprisingly sedentary for long stretches of time.  The one advantage animated movies have over live action films is that they are completely unbound by the laws of gravity, so there's really no excuse for any such film to ""drag"" (again, pardon the pun) in the way this one does.  There's a lyrical scene where Sally and Lightning envision what the town must have looked like in its pre-highway heyday, but so much of the middle section of the film is taken up with liquid dialogues and less-than-inspired slapstick routines that the movie often feels like it is caught in cruise control or stalling out altogether when what we really want is for it to race along at a breakneck speed worthy of its subject matter.  In short, the film probably would have been better had it used such anarchic chase movies as ""The Great Race,""  ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" or ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines"" as its source of inspiration.  Then, perhaps, more of the film would have been on a par, in terms of dynamism and excitement, with the astonishing racing sequence that closes the film.The movie pokes affectionate fun at the commercialization of racing, and there is no end to the clever punning that has gone into the naming of the characters and places that populate the film.  These, along with the stunning visuals, are enough to recommend the film for any viewer.  But, in the long run, I have to say that, for all its good qualities, ""Cars"" is too often stuck in neutral.",3,fantastic animation but too often stuck in neutral,1169596800,"01 24,

634640,A26WVK274IA7DN,B00005JNS0,Sarah Bellum,"[11, 17]","Pixar usually makes children's films that also appeal to adults on many levels, including jokes that fly well above the heads of youngsters. My son, who is three, loves to watch the first ten minutes of ""Cars."" Then he gets extremely bored and stops watching. Good films, such as ""Finding Nemo,"" ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" and ""Toy Story,"" will hold his attention for the duration. (He knows ""Finding Nemo"" from start to finish and has watched it, at minimum, fifty times.)  I also enjoy good children's movies (I know most of the lines from ""Finding Nemo""), yet I find this film tedious. At a runtime of nearly two hours, I cannot sit through the entire movie in one sitting and even then have a difficult time watching all of it. It starts out well enough and the ending, with its positive messages of friendship, loyalty and good sportsmanship, is quite good. Much of the material in between, however, is fairly weak. Scenes drag on far too long and are just plain dull. The messages could have been conveyed in fewer and more truncated scenes and still have been as effective. The basis for a very good film here is certainly evident. As usual, Pixar's animation is excellent and the tone is just right for kids: simple without being condescending and with very sparse scatological humor (which is an astonishing feat, given Larry the Cable Guy's involvement). The voice acting is well cast and features uniformly fine performances. With more judicious writing and editing, ""Cars"" could have been another Pixar classic.

Ironically Cars was also the sole Pixar film I had not seen. Pixar to me is perfect and only makes Masterpieces, Even the companies OK work (Bugs life and Brave) is still lightyears better than 95 percent of most animated features on the market. So combining my love for Pixar as well as the dozens and dozens of medicore Cars reviews I have heard, I decided to pretend this cheesy looking cash grab didn't exist.Now we cut to almost 8 years since the movie came out and my completionist inner self came out and I finally said &#34;Ugh I guess I should so I can say I have watched every Pixar film...&#34;.I can't believe I waited this long to see what has to be one of my new favorite Pixar films! I don't know what to tell you, I was on a flight when I watched it and was very tired. Maybe it was the excitement of my upcoming trip (I was going to Disney World), or maybe I was just drunk still from the night before. I ended up loving this movie 10 times more than I thought I would have. While my review is 8 years too late I will skip the story synopsis and give some of my own personal highlights from the film.Radiator Springs - If this movie was set in the big city I most likely would have been turned off. I am a sucker for nostalgia. Radiator Springs struck me as a old town you expect to see in 1950s America. Mom and pop shops, everyone knows your name, people take pride in their business as well as town. That sort of this captivates me and has me care.Mater - While I can see the hate for Mater his comparison to being Pixars Jar Jar Binks is just ludicrous! No matter what at the end of the day, as adult as most Pixar movies can be, there primary audience and demographic will always be geared towards children. With that being said I can appreciate children's love for Mater and at the same time love his selfless morals that can instill values in children regarding loyalty and friendshipMorals - This hit a big one with me. Yes the &#34;Winning isn't everything&#34; message is in a million movies but I loved it here. At the end of the movie (which is geared towards children may I remind you!) it teaches a message that sometimes winning isn't everything and trying your hardest is most important in life.Now I know I sound all preachy with my review but I assure you this is not some super duper christian morals review or some right wing conservative view. I am an adult with very adult tastes regarding movies but I felt compelled to rate this review towards its primary demo, Children and there parents.

Somewhere along the lines there has to be more action and humor.  The funny moments are few and far between.  Most of the humor relies on jokes about how the other characters are presented.  How this is supposed to be funny for a over an hour is beyond me.  You giggle about how the characters talk for a few minutes and then you look for more, but you don't get it.  After all of this, the movie has a rather boring ending that almost makes you feel let down after you have waited for so long for more action.

The CG is stunning as expected, but it's success is primarily attributed to the great story/script and the outstanding details which captivate its audience all the way. I had the impulse to write a review immediately then but had been stopped by the many negative reviews that complained it's too targeted at adults and not so good for kids as other Pixar movies. I thought, ""May be I am really too old (40) and so I have rated too high an animaion that tributed to the aged or the veterans."" However, last night, when we were in a mall watching an AV shop showing it in a 42"" 1080P True HD Sony LCDTV, together with many little kids and their parents, we were attracted not only by the fantastic video effect (We only have a 29"" CRT at home and were astonished by how much visual details we missed), but how parents got to drag/pull/tow their kids away.

634660,A2KKQ2K4O2GY2Y,B00005JNS0,Sonja,"[0, 1]","Cars is about the only feature length movie that my little kids can watch without having to be afraid that the main character(s) are going to be killed.  How is it that so many ""kids"" movies feature scene after scene of the animated characters (usually animals) running for their lives under the threat of death?  ""Finding Nemo"" coming to mind right away.  Not only all that issue, but the movie starts with the mother and all of Nemo's siblings getting killed.  Do children really need to contemplate this possibility?  I also checked out ""A Bug's Life.""  The grasshoppers are really scary, threaten the life of the little ant, Dot, and also plan to kill the reigning Queen.  Then there's the scene with the bird trying to eat them.  And of course the end where Flick maneuvers Hopper into a location so that he can get captured by a bird, and then - of all things! - fed to the baby birds.I really don't understand why kids movies, in general, feature that kind of ""life and death"" tension.  Plenty of adult movies don't have those themes and are nonetheless compelling.  And that's what we have with Cars.  No one is trying to kill anyone - whew!  And although Chick Hicks is ""the bad guy"" and ""a meanie,"" he's only is a small portion of the movie.  And the aggressive stuff he does is pushing and shoving the other cars, which isn't great, but at least it's not some animated animal punching, kicking, biting, and/or stomping on another.  Chick Hicks aside, the main storyline of the movie is about Lightening McQueen's personal growth and what he learns about friendship and life.  These are an appropriate topics for children to consider, in my opinion!  These are issues that I expect my children to confront in their own lives, unlike (God willing) running for their lives and/or getting beaten senseless and/or losing family members to acts of violence and/or engineering a situation that results in the death of their ""enemies.""In summation, I wish there were other great, high quality movies out there that can appeal to kids (and adults!) without resulting to violence and death as motivating factors for the characters.  Cars proves that we can be motivated by other things than these, such as what it means to have a friend and be a friend.",5,great kids movie with very little violence and NO death - wow!,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,2254,"['Cars', 'only', 'feature', 'length', 'movie', 'little', 'kids', 'can', 'watch', 'having', 'be', 'afraid', 'main', 'character', 's', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'killed', 'How', 'so', 'many', 'kids', 'movies', 'feature', 'scene', 'scene', 'animated', 'characters', 'usually', 'animals', 'running', 'lives', 'threat', 'death', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'coming', 'mind', 'right', 'away', 'Not', 'only', 'issue', 'movie', 'mother', 'Nemo', 'siblings', 'getting', 'killed', 'Do', 'children', 'really', 'need', 'contemplate', 'possibility', 'also', 'checked', 'out', 'Bug', 'Life', 'grasshoppers', 'are', 'really', 'scary', 'threaten', 'life', 'little', 'ant', 'Dot', 'also', 'plan', 'kill', 'reigning', 'Queen', 'Then', 'scene', 'bird', 'trying', 'eat', 'course', 'end', 'where', 'Flick', 'Hopper', 'location', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'captured', 'bird', 'then', 'things', 'fed', 'baby', 'birds.I', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'kids', 'movies', 'general', 'feature', 'kind', 'life', 'death', 'tension', 'Plenty', 'adult', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'themes', 'are', 'nonetheless', 'compelling', 'what', 'have', 'Cars', 'one', 'trying', 'kill', 'anyone', 'whew', 'Chick', 'Hicks', 'bad', 'guy', 'meanie', 'only', 'small', 'portion', 'movie', 'aggressive', 'stuff', 'pushing', 'shoving', 'other', 'cars', ""n't"", 'great', 'least', 'not', 'animated', 'animal', 'punching', 'kicking', 'biting', 'and/or', 'stomping', 'Chick', 'Hicks', 'aside', 'main', 'storyline', 'movie', 'Lightening', 'McQueen', 'personal', 'growth', 'what', 'friendship', 'life', 'are', 'appropriate', 'topics', 'children', 'consider', 'opinion', 'are', 'issues', 'expect', 'children', 'confront', 'own', 'lives', 'God', 'willing', 'running', 'lives', 'getting', 'beaten', 'senseless', 'and/or', 'losing', 'family', 'members', 'acts', 'violence', 'and/or', 'engineering', 'situation', 'results', 'death', 'enemies', 'summation', 'wish', 'were', 'other', 'great', 'high', 'quality', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'can', 'appeal', 'kids', 'adults', 'resulting', 'violence', 'death', 'motivating', 'factors', 'characters', 'Cars', 'can', 'be', 'motivated', 'other', 'things', 'such', 'what', 'have', 'friend', 'be', 'friend']",N/A

634663,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B00005JNS0,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[66, 73]","When I saw this movie in the theaters I enjoyed watching it enough, but I kept thinking this was the worst Pixar film I have seen. Funny thing is the worst Pixar film is still A grade material compared to most other animated features released. And while Cars didn't wow me on the big screen the way The Incredibles or Monsters Inc (or a score of other Pixar films) the film grew on me in a big way when we got it home. You see my son (two years old at the time) loved to watch it. Being the inclusive dad that I am I would watch it with him. I got what Pixar was doing when I first saw Cars, but it didn't resonate with me until repeated viewings. Now, while it's still not my favorite Pixar movie, Cars made a believer out of me in what they were saying about this film.You see Cars isn't just a cartoon about a world where cars are people. It's a tribute of the history of the automobile, a nod to NASCAR and its roots, and a love letter to Route 66. All of this done in a family-friendly and colorful animated universe. Any car nut with a broad spectrum interest in the automobile will find lots of different cars from different eras getting face time on this movie. NASCAR fans will love the racing sequences and level of detail dedicated to the sport. Those who remember the days before the Interstate system where there was as much fun travelling to your destination as there was being there will feel nostalgic for that time again. The movie hits on multiple levels, which is what makes it better than the sum of its parts.Take that all away and you still have a fun cartoon. You have cars talking and acting like people for God's sake! The kids will eat that up! Cars are getting into crazy situations that are in their own way a slight play on human issues. There are plenty of little jokes on that vein that both the kids and parents can laugh over. There is even a joke or two with a double meaning the adults may get a kick out of. This is all classic Pixar and does much to fill in the little spaces between story development.The story? Well like I said when I first saw it I got what they were saying, but wasn't impressed. It's essentially much like an episode of The Andy Griffith Show I remember seeing where somebody from the big city gets stuck in Mayberry, desparate to get out, only to end up loving the town and wanting more. Maybe it was because it was in a way the preachiest of the Pixar films telling us we should slow down our busy lives and go back to simpler times. Not that it's a bad message. Just not one that held onto on first viewing. Well after watching it several more times with my excited toddler the little details come into play that I either missed or ignored the first time around. The sleepy town that slowly comes to life the more their new visitor gives to it. The beautiful backdrops of painted deserts and canyons. There is character growth going on.Cartoons live and die by their voice actors. While just about every animation company puts out movies that take advantage of celebrity power to gain an audience Pixar is one of the few who has consistently been able to get the best performances from them, and cars is no different. Every celebrity voice is pitch perfect and puts you in the view of the character more than the actor. Larry the Cable Guy as Mater the tow truck easily steals the show, but does it in such a way where you absolutely know it's Larry doing the voice, but you see Mater as a character in of itself rather than a cartoon Larry. Owen Wilson puts his best sly, but whiner-like demeanor for racing star McQueen that's his best. Some characters I still have trouble recognizing the transformation is so good. Tony Shalhoub (better known as Monk from the TV series) is absolutely unbelievable as tire shop owner Luigi. Better yet Michael Keaton as Chic Hicks barely sounds like Michael. Michael makes what is essentially the villain in the movie a very enjoyable and charismatic cut up. I can go on, but suffice it to say the ""acting"" is top notch.Animation wise all I have to say is this is Pixar. They are just about the best in the business and what you see in this movie will impress even today. The race scenes are dynamically shot the same way you would see a big NASCAR race with gravel, debris, smoke and skid marks looking real. The level of detail is very impressive from the waxed shine on the cars to the minute dust.This Blu-Ray release is pretty much identical to the previous release, but this time they include the DVD version as well. The differences between the Blu-Ray and DVD versions visually are striking, and that's admitting the DVD looks great. The Blu-Ray technically has two menus, but that's not a big deal. One of the menus has three options which are the movie, bonus cartoons and featurettes. Here's a breakdown (features on the DVD will have an * beside them):Mater and the Ghost Light*: Like all Pixar releases Cars comes with both the animated short that was viewed before the movie in theaters plus a totally new short related to the movie itself. This is a story about Mater scaring the town with little tricks so he is told a story about the infamous Ghost Light, which he then appears to experience after left alone. Goofy funny with Mater kind of replaying a number of scenes from the movie in a different way.One Man Band*: This is the short that was played before the movie in theaters. It's about two street musicians ""dueling"" for a little girl's coin. The musicians get more outrageous in their zeal for the money and things end up going crazy.Mater in Bounding: Remember the Pixar short with the Jackalope and sheep? Well this is a quickie (non hi-def) short of Mater replacing the sheep bouncing all over the place. I think it's something the animators put together for fun and are sharing with us.End Credits: Here you can see the animation end credits in full frame without the credits. Love the previous Pixar movie references.Production Features include:Two Full Length Commentaries: One is by Lasseter and the other with the production team (with pictures).Inspiration for 'Cars'*: Documentary told by John Lasseter on the inspiration for Cars including a jaunt through Route 66 and seeing some race cars in action.Documentary Shorts: There are seven little items here. ""Radiator Springs,"" ""Character Design,"" ""Animation and Acting,"" ""Real World Racing: Getting Geeky with the Details,"" ""Hudson Hornet,"" ""Graphics"" and ""Darrell Waltrip Museum Tour"". This is the real meat of the extras. You get to see the real love for the source material and how much they put into making the movie as much a car-lovers movie as possible.Cine-Explore: This is a way to see behind the scenes stuff while watching the movie. You can set it automatic or manually punch in the content. Much of the content comes from the other featurettes.Deleted Scenes*: These are just sketches and storyboards that never went beyond pre-production. It's interesting to see how the script evolved, but don't expect extra cartoons.Carfinder Game: It's dubbed as a very sophisticated BD game, but I call it incredibly tedious. The has three play modes. The primary mode is where you have to select a car from the bottom of your screen when it shows up in the movie. Next is the same concept, but this time the screen is frozen for an amount of time due to a massive amount of cars to rummage through. Third is like a bonus round where you get three images of the same car and you have to pick which one is accurate (with the other two having often the slightest differences in them).The reward for going through the game (which you cannot get out of until you finish the movie with it) is a Showroom that has all the cars you found. You can click on the showroom and get a pretty neat profile of that car and it's personal history. I have to admit I really like getting this information as it broadens the story greatly. It's just a bear of a game to go through. This isn't a casual game to kill a little time. Be prepared to commit.Cars is one of those movies that is very different from anything else out there, but then again you can say that for a good number of Pixar movies. It's a great movie for the car lover and those who enjoy remembering the 1950's driving experience where drive-ins and cruising mainstreet were how you treat a Friday night. Oh yeah... car racing fans will definitely get a kick out this film. If you aren't into any of that then you still should give this movie a try. It's VERY accessible to just everybody out there.",5,"Pixar does it again, but it had to grow on me.",1301443200,"03 30, 2011",2011,8535,"['When', 'saw', 'movie', 'theaters', 'enjoyed', 'watching',

Disney's recent animated efforts pale in comparison to Pixar's. For proof of this, take a look at the Disney theme parks; Pixar characters are everywhere, in rides, as characters meeting the public, in parades, in shows. You would be hard pressed to find any representation from ""Treasure Planet"", ""Chicken Little"" or ""Hercules"". You might see Chicken Little doing a `Character Meet and Greet', but that's about it. Disney needs Pixar. And vice versa. No other movie studio has a marketing machine geared towards and a reputation for family films.The two are a match made in heaven.When you produce such consistently great films, as Pixar does, it becomes necessary to rate them against themselves. There is no other scale; they have raised the bar too high. Rating ""Cars"" on the same scale as DreamWorks's ""Over the Hedge"" just isn't going to work. ""Hedge"" is good, but Pixar films are in a class by themselves. It becomes a matter of is it ""Toy Story/ The Incredibles"" good or simply ""Monsters, Inc"" good? ""The Incredibles"" and the ""Toy Story"" films represent modern examples of perfection in the art of animation. For that matter, there are few live action films that can compare. ""A Bug's Life"" and ""Monsters, Inc"" are both very good, but they aren't perfect. ""Cars"", the newest film from Pixar, with the voice talents of Paul Newman, Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt and John Ratzenberger, is very good, but it's ""Monsters, Inc."" good. It isn't perfect.Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), a rookie car on the Piston Cup circuit, has the moves and attitude to win the Cup, upsetting the King (Richard Petty), the veteran in his last race, and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), the venerable also-ran determined to win. After a three-way tie, the cars head out to California to perform for the title. Lightning upsets his third pit crew of the year, all of whom quit, and he sets off to California with simply his truck, Mack (John Ratzenberger). Lightning pressures Mack to drive through the night and along the way, Lightning gets separated and lost. He ends up in Radiator Springs, a sleepy little town on Route 66, far off the interstate. Disoriented, Lightning causes some damage and Sally (Bonnie Hunt), a Porsche, who lives in the town wants to see the damage repaired, pressuring Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), the town's judge, to order Lightning to fix the road before he leaves. Determined to get to California, Lightning tries to fulfill his duty but gets distracted by the residents of Radiator Springs.Directed by John Lasseter (""Toy Story"" and its sequel), ""Cars"" is a beautiful, richly detailed look at a world where cars live just like humans. Nearly great, the film has many things going for it and one key thing working against it.Both a brilliant idea for an animated film and a brilliant marketing concept, ""Cars"" has a lot going for it. With NASCAR gaining popularity every week, this animated effort seems guaranteed to receive some cross-over. Also, how quickly can they retrofit the Speedway attractions at the theme parks? Let's freshen those babies up.From the opening scenes, depicting a race at the Motor Speedway of the South, the computer generated animation is flawless in design and detail. Really, the only detail telling us this film is animated is the faces on the cars. Beyond that, the scenery and production design are flawless. We believe we are watching a real race at a real speedway (complete with cars filling the stands, doing the wave, and RVs parked in the center of the track) and the scenes of Lightning speeding through the landscape look like they were filmed, the landscapes appear so real I could almost smell the pine trees and the desert wind blowing across the open plain. The shots of Lightning and Sally driving through the forest are simply stunning. When they visit Ornament Valley, the rocks are beautiful and look like hood ornaments. When the race car arrives at Radiator Springs, the filmmakers have created a loving tribute to the little towns, motels, businesses, tourist attractions and icons which used to dot Route 66 during its heyday.All of the cars are created with loving detail, each based on an actual car or vehicle. Even the car governor of California is a Hummer with an Austrian accent. Lightning is a race car, I'm going to guess a Mustang, I couldn't quite identify him, but Porsches, Ferraris, Buicks, Hudson Hornets and more, both old and new, make an appearance.The voice talents are, as always, exceptional. Owen Wilson brings the right blend of cocky upstart and guts to Lightning McQueen.  When he eventually realizes what his life is missing, and what he needs to do to fix it, we believe it. Paul Newman is perfect as Doc Hudson, the elder statesman of Radiator Springs. Once a powerful, cocky star in his own right, he prefers the quiet life in his little town. I read Newman, car buff that he is, suggested his character's make and model, giving Doc Hudson even more detail. He also has the right amount of gravelly intonation for a car fifty plus years old; you can imagine the carburetor adding to Doc's voice, in much the way Newman's voice adds resonance to the character. Hunt is good as the Porsche looking to protect and preserve the town and its inhabitants. Larry the Cable Guy is amusing as Tom Mater, the tow truck who is a few spark plugs short of a full engine. Tony Shalhoub plays Luigi, a little Italian car who runs the local tire shop and is obsessed with all things Ferrari. A number of real-life race car drivers make cameos as their cars and Tom and Ray, the Car Talk Guys from NPR, play the owners of Lightning's poorly funded sponsors.I have to give a lot of credit to Pixar. They could've so easily made the race cars even more realistic and covered them with real sponsors, much like the real thing. Thankfully, we are spared from watching endless logos for Home Depot and the like. Instead, all of the sponsors are fictional, and provide a level of humor to the tale. Lightning's sponsors are Rust-Eze, the rear bumper rust lubricant. He longs to be sponsored by Dinoco, a large oil company. Get it? Dinoco, large oil company. Dinosaurs. Oil. Chick (Keaton) is sponsored by HTB, Hostile Takeover Bank. These are cute jokes, some of which are worked into the story, providing another level of detail to an already richly observed universe.The problem with ""Cars"" is pacing. The film seems long and ten or fifteen minutes edited out middle would've improved the film greatly, giving it a faster rhythm, making it nearly unforgettable. As it is, the middle drags and we begin to fidget in our seats a bit.""Cars"" is fun, amusing and brilliantly designed. Sure to provide amusement for everyone in the family. As I have said many times, the mark of a classic animated film is it entertains the kids as well as the adults who have to take them. Would it entertain just adults? I heard a lot of laughter from adults, and a lot of laughter from the kids. At times a chorus, at others one group could be heard over the other. I can't imagine a better family film until maybe the next Pixar release, in summer, 2007, ""Ratatouile"", about a rat trying to eat good food in Paris.",4,How Long Before They Change the Name to

I was kind of bored in the theater with this film. I didn't find the idea of cars talking that interesting, the characters are bland and boring, the story doesn't work greatly, and there's barely an evil villain to work with. This Pixar film wasn't too acclaimed as opposed to the other Pixar films such as ""Finding Nemo"" and ""The Incredibles"". Reviews for this film were positive enough to pass but not greatly, and it was not a giant hit at the box office. The only reason why its popular is that Disney uses this film just to sell car toys to little kids. I didn't really like playing with cars as a little kid, and I still see it boring. This film is one of the sterotypical boy thing that I don't really like when I go out to the Disney store or Disney world. I don't normally play this game, but in my opinion, ""Cars"" is just for kids, and I mean 2-4 year old boys more likely. I really wish Disney would focus more on other balanced films than this.  The fact that this film made so much money from the toys is why ""Cars"" was the first Pixar film other than ""Toy Story"" to give a sequel, and guess what; "" Cars 2"" became Pixar's least critically successful film.

634691,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B00005JNS0,Tom Benton,"[14, 16]","In Pixar's CARS, directed by TOY STORY director John Lasseter, the world is populated entirely by - you guessed it - cars.  So it's only natural that the biggest event in the entire car world is the Piston Cup, the world's most popular race (inspired by the ever-popular NASCAR racing).  This year, the public's rooting for Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), an immensely-talented albeit egotistic rookie.  While traveling to California to prepare for the Piston Cup, Lightning's driver, Mack (John Ratzenberger), dozes off and sends Lightning off into the middle of nowhere.  The middle of nowhere happens to be the small town of Radiator Springs, or - as Lightning described it - ""hillbilly hell"".  Though at first Lightning wants nothing more than to escape from Radiator Springs and win the Piston Cup, he gradually becomes more and more attached to the town and its citizens, eventually realizing that friends and family mean more than fame.Pixar makes family movies better than anyone.  Adults find their films just as entertaining as do children.  CARS is no exception, though it lacks the power of many of Pixar's previous creations, such as TOY STORY or FINDING NEMO.  Also, it is becoming more and more clear that Pixar's films seem to revolve around the same sort of formula.  Eventually, I believe that this will begin to bother some adults, but the children will go on loving these films, and that's what the films are here for in the first place.The cast for CARS is even more impressive than that of previous Pixar films.  The cast includes, along with Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Cheech Marin, Tony Shalhoub, George Carlin, NASCAR racers Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt Jr., FINDING NEMO/A BUG'S LIFE director Andrew Stanton, Jay Leno, and Michael Keaton.  That is quite the cast.  It also features music by Randy Newman and some fantastic animation.Despite all that it has going for it, CARS was considered a flop at the box office, primarily when compared to Pixar's previous masterpieces.  I believe that this is due in part to the advertising, which I thought made the film look like many of the other stupid CGI family film imitations in theaters recently.  All I can say is disregard the advertising and see the film for yourself.  It's another delightful family film from Pixar.  Your kids'll love it, and you'll love it too.

It's the biggest racing event of the year and there are three favorites to win:  conceited Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), The King and reigning champion Strip Weathers (Richard Petty), and young maverick Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson).  McQueen seems to be a sure bet to win, but at the finish line the race ends in a three-way tie.  The officials decide that a run-off race between the three cars will be held in L.A.On the road trip across the country to L.A., Lightning finds himself stranded in the dessert.  After a late night chase with a cop, McQueen finds himself in the jail of small town Radiator Springs.  The judge, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) sentences McQueen to refinish the road he destroyed.  Time is running out until the big race off in L.A., but his community service allows McQueen to finally know and understand that the most important things in life don't necessarily involve living in the fast lane.CARS was faulted by many critics at the time of its initial release as being a good movie with some impressive voice talent, but, nevertheless, the worst of Pixar's films.  There's a reason for this.  CARS is all about small towns, NASCAR, and Route 66.  Most critics live either on the West Coat, the East Coast, or in Chicago.  The movie greatly appeals to middle America, the heartland of the country.  For someone used to a metropolitan lifestyle, CARS must be difficult to understand.

Once again, Pixar has come up with a story that is both engaging and meaningful, whose characters are endearing with effects that take animation one more level up. I actually fell in love with the little red racecar named Lightning McQueen. Now, I know guys are supposed to love cars - but this is ridiculous.Lightning is in love with himself. He thinks he doesn't need anyone else, even a pit crew. As the fastest rookie on the circuit, he thinks he's got everything he needs. He three-way ties for first place in the Piston Cup race and has to do a race off in California with the two other fastest cars: ego maniac Chick Hicks and good ol' boy The King. But on the way, he gets lost in the Arizona desert and ends up in a little forgotten town on legendary Route 66 called Radiator Springs, where he tears up the pavement on the town's main street and has to serve time repairing it. In the course of events, a little tow truck named Mater befriends him, as do most of the rest of the town, and he discovers there's been something missing from his life that he kind of likes: friends. He's been in such a hurry to be the fastest car on the track that he hasn't taken the time to enjoy, or realize how much he needs, other people - er, cars.It's a great story, and masterfully directed by John Lasseter (Toy Story I & II, A Bug's Life). Owen Wilson's voice is perfect for Lightning, as is Larry the Cable Guy as Mater. The writing is superb, and the animation - whew! The Nascar experience is perfectly reproduced with everyone participating as a vehicle - including the audience and announcers. There are even some actual racecar drivers playing themselves as cars, like Darrell Waltrip and Mario Andretti.The Route 66 experience is equally compelling, and actually the best part of the film, in my opinion. The underlying message is that there is something missing in our fast paced lives that if we would just slow down we might recapture. Thus, the metaphor between the race track (as well as the Interstate) and Route 66, which used to be a very scenic, well driven road that represented a more gracious time in our history - a time when friends and family were more important than getting ahead and winning the rat race.It's a great movie and a great DVD - a little slim on the extra features, but still well worth the money. I hope you fall in love with Lightning McQueen as I did.Waitsel Smith",5,SURPRISINGLY CLEVER AND ENGAGING,1165104000,"12 3, 2006",2006,2512,"['doubted', 'story', 'populated', 'cars', 'could', 'actually', 'make', 'interesting', 'movie', 'boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'Once', 'again', 'Pixar', 'come', 'up', 'story', 'engaging', 'meaningful', 'characters', 'are', 'endearing', 'effects', 'take', 'animation', 'one', 'more', 'level', 'up', 'actually', 'fell', 'love', 'little', 'red', 'racecar', 'named', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'Now', 'know', 'guys', 'are', 'supposed', 'love', 'cars', 'ridiculous.Lightning', 'love', ""n't"", 'need', 'anyone', 'else', 'even', 'pit', 'crew', 'fastest', 'rookie', 'circuit', 'got', 'everything', 'three-way', 'ties', 'first', 'place', 'Piston', 'Cup', 'race', 'do', 'race', 'California', 'two', 'other', 'fastest', 'cars', 'ego', 'maniac', 'Chick', 'Hicks', 'good', 'ol', 'King', 'way', 'lost', 'Arizona', 'desert', 'up', 'little', 'forgotten', 'town', 'legendary', 'Route', '66', 'called', 'Radiator', 'Springs', 'where', 'up', 'pavement', 'town', 'main', 'street', 'serve', 'time', 'repairing', 'course', 'events', 'little', 'tow', 'truck', 'named', 'Mater', 'do', 'most', 'rest', 'town', 'been', 'something', 'missing', 'life', 'kind', 'likes', 'friends', 'been', 'such', 'hurry', 'be', 'fastest', 'car', 'track', ""n't"", 'taken', 'time', 'enjoy', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'other', 'people', 'er', 'cars.It', 'great', 'story', 'masterfully', 'directed', 'John', 'Lasseter', 'Toy', 'Story', 'II', 'A', 'Bug', 'Life', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'voice', 'perfect', 'Lightning', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'Mater', 'writing', 'superb', 'animation', 'whew', 'Nascar', 'experience', 'perfectly', 'reproduced', 'everyone', 'participating', 'vehicle', 'including', 'audience', 'announcers', 'are', 'even', 'actual', 'racecar', 'drivers', 'playing', 'cars', 'Darrell', 'Waltrip', 'Mario', 'Andretti.The', 'Route', '66', 'experience', 'equally', 'compelling', 'actually', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'opinion', 'underlying', 'message', 'something', 'missing', 'fast', 'paced', 'lives', 'would', 'just', 'slow', 'down', 'might', 'recapture', 'Thus', 'metaphor', 'race', 'track', 'as', 'well', 'Interstate', '66', 'used', 'be', 'very', 'scenic', 'well', 'driven', 'road', 'represented', 'more', 'gracious', 'time', 'history', 'time', 'when', 'friends', 'family', 'were', 'more', 'important', 'getting', 'ahead', 'winning', 'rat', 'race.It', 'great', 'movie', 'great', 'DVD', 'little', 'slim', 'extra', 'features', 'still', 'well', 'money', 'hope', 'fall', 'love', 'Lightning', 'McQueen', 'did.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A

Pixar's success has been the result of paying more attention to the journey than the destination -- it's the unexpected ways the plots are worked out, and clever surprises along the way that make the telling of the story fresh (or at least seem fresh).""Cars"" is the tale of Lightning McQueen, an arrogant, self-centered race car who has to learn that winning isn't everything, and that one's path through life is more important than the destination. We've seen all this before, but Lasseter & friends handle it with some degree of subtlety, with the story driven by character, not plot. (See my review of ""Spirited Away"", which is basically the same story, but developed very, very badly.) And there are some grin-inducing surprises, such as the cow-tipping sequence. The ending is also pleasing -- Lightning decides that winning the big race is not the most-important thing, and is amply rewarded in other ways.""Cars"" is a good film, but not quite up to the standards of most of the preceding Pixars. Why, I can't say. All the parts are present, but the pistons just don't seem to be firing at full power. Perhaps not enough time is spent with the secondary characters. I intend to watch ""Cars"" again, but mostly to catch all the little details, gags, and asides I missed the first time. Unlike the ""Toy Story""s, ""A Bug's Life"", or ""The Incredibles"", it's not a film I'm likely to watch because I feel like some mood-lifting fun. It's all a bit too mechanical. (Your mileage may vary.)The extras are of the generally high quality one expects from Pixar. The ""making of"" is, if anything, too short -- one would like to know more about the people Lasseter met along Route 66. ""Mater and the Ghostlight"" is amusing but ultimately pointless (it was apparently a deleted sequence -- Mater suggests that he and Lightning stay up to look for the ghostlight, but they don't -- and was animated as a DVD bonus), while ""One-Man Band"" is witty and a beautiful piece of CGI animation. (No one has yet matched Pixar, aesthetically or technically.)I'm surprised Disney's 1951 cartoon ""Susie, the Little Blue Coupe"", an obvious influence, isn't included. Regardless of how one might feel about the typically cute/sentimental story, it's a pleasure to watch a cartoon short subject made with as much attention to detail and quality as a feature film.PS: Disney HD showed ""Cars"" last night, and I watched because I had nothing better to do that I felt like doing.

Some even get a fair bit of star power for the voice actors. Despite high standards all around, though, Pixar reliably comes through with the best in scripts and characterization, on top of cutting edge technology.The story itself is kid-friendly: an obnoxious egotist discovers the value of having friends. But, as with any familiar recipe, it's easy to enjoy yet another preparation of it if done well. Pixar's real strength, all the way back to Luxo Junior, lies in bringing the character to life. Their artists have a wild talent for giving feeling and personality to inanimate obejects, while staying (mostly) true to the object itself. When the objects are as varied as cars and trucks are already, that gives them huge scope to work with - and they do. From Doc, to Lightning, to Sally, to Mater (get it? ""to mater""?), to the tractors, each comes across as a unique individual. It doesn't hurt to have little things like Tom & Ray - aka Klick and Klack, the real-world car guys - helping out.Too bad I missed this when it first came out. It's held up well, though, and will remain enjoyable for years to come.

634717,A38N7SFDOB3MR3,B00005JNS0,Wisconsin Dad,"[208, 260]","After seeing so many children's movies with animals lately (Hoodwinked, Over the Hedge, Ice Age 2, etc.) Cars was a needed change. It was wonderful sitting down to a movie that offered something a bit different. Don't get me wrong, our family loves movies with goofy animals. But after laughing at and with Tow Mater for 2 hours, I was so glad I didn't see a silly squirrel in the whole movie. Tow Mater was awesome. We all hope to see Tow starring in his own flick! Bring on the sequel!!!With that said, Cars is a heart warming story of a race car called Lightning McQueen who is full of himself. Lightning stumbles off the beaten path of life, and onto the backroads of route 66. There, Lightning McQueen finds all the things he was missing in life because of his self-absorption: friends, beauty, and love.I was very pleasantly suprised with the story. Yes, Cars had many, many funny parts (especially the tractor tipping, and Tow Mater), but the story itself is what shines like a diamond. Cars is a movie that will have you leaving the theatre changed, looking for love, beauty and cherishing what you have. I can't give a movie any greater compliment than this.

Cars, though? Well, to be honest, I really don't like this film that much, if any at all.I freely admit that this is just a personal thing, but I found no part of this movie particularly funny, interesting, or entertaining. I really like the concept and the kind of humor that could get out of it, but as far a i could see, their was no reason that the characters were cars. No attempt at any sort of car-related humor was attempted as far as I could see, and I think it was more of an excuse for Pixar to not have to animate people, because their people always look a little... well... scary.All this aside though, I just found Cars to be very boring. the action was standard, the characters weren't really all that interesting (certainly not as interesting or complex as Finding Nemo's cast was) and I ultimately found myself checking my watch while watching it; never a good sign. The animation was Pixar quality, so nothing bad there, there were just no surprises to this movie. The story was standard with nothing new in the mix, the dialog between the characters was wooden and unnatural, and i think i was the only one who hated Larry the Cable Guy's car Mater. I just wanted to punch him, he was so annoying.If you like this film, power to you. If you haven't seen this movie, trust me; go watch Finding Nemo again, or go see The Incredibles, that's an okay one too.

Paul Newman has resisted doing films with special effects, but this one was tailor made for him since its about cars and car racing.
