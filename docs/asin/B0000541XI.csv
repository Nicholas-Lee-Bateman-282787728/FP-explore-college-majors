The dialogue is top notch, as is the quality of animation. It will mostly have you laughing and shaking your head, but it will sometimes tug at you a bit in its more sentimental moments.Watch Tylor in a group. It's great fun when everybody laughs in the same room. This isn't anime as I would have written it...it's anime as I never thought of before! I can't wait to see the OVAs.",5,"Hilarious, entertaining, and intelligently scripted.",1005350400,"11 10, 2001",2001,620,"['people', 'think', 'have', 'difficulty', 'imagining', 'animated', 'series', 'based', 'idiocy', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'general', 'gaffs', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'quot', 'intelligently', 'scripted.', 'quot', 'series', 'really', 'go', 'directions', 'nobody', 'dialogue', 'top', 'notch', 'quality', 'animation', 'will', 'mostly', 'have', 'laughing', 'shaking', 'head', 'will', 'sometimes', 'tug', 'bit', 'more', 'sentimental', 'moments.Watch', 'Tylor', 'group', 'great', 'fun', 'when', 'everybody', 'same', 'room', ""n't"", 'anime', 'would', 'have', 'written', 'anime', 'never', 'thought', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'OVAs']",Irresponsible Captain Tylor - Collection
566661,A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L,B0000541XI,Michael Valdivielso,"[3, 4]","The Irresponsible Captain Tylor series is just what it's title suggests.  Tylor joins the United Planets Space Force.  Why?  Because they will pay him and feed him and he won't have to do anything.  Tylor is truly irresponsible. Or is he?  As the series unfolds, and war comes to the universe, we follow Tylor in his adventures, as he becomes a Captain of a old ship and a mis-matched batch of unwanted soldiers, pilots and crewmembers.Is he really irresponsible or is he the only person who happens to be sane and comfortable with himself?  This is as much sci-fi as it is philosophy and I really started to enjoy it - but then is ended.  Lucky for me, there is a OVA and, I believe, a few movies.  I plan to grab them.26 episodes and OK for most ages.  Crispin Freeman at his best - he's Tylor's English voice and it sounded like he REALLY enjoyed it.",5,Fly me to the Moon...,1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,853,"['Irresponsible', 'Captain', 'Tylor', 'series', 'just', 'what', 'title', 'suggests', 'Tylor', 'United', 'Planets', 'Space', 'Force', 'Why', 'will', 'pay', 'feed', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'anything', 'Tylor', 'truly', 'irresponsible', 'series', 'unfolds', 'war', 'universe', 'follow', 'adventures', 'Captain', 'old', 'ship', 'mis-matched', 'batch', 'unwanted', 'soldiers', 'pilots', 'crewmembers.Is', 'really', 'irresponsible', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'be', 'sane', 'comfortable', 'as', 'much', 'sci-fi', 'philosophy', 'really', 'started', 'enjoy', 'then', 'ended', 'Lucky', 'OVA', 'believe', 'few', 'movies', 'plan', 'grab', 'them.26', 'episodes', 'OK', 'most', 'ages', 'Crispin', 'Freeman', 'best', 'Tylor', 'English', 'voice', 'sounded', 'REALLY', 'enjoyed']",Irresponsible Captain Tylor - Collection
566662,A3MECYYIZJA8JJ,B0000541XI,"Midnight Run ""5000""","[2, 2]","I heard a lot about this one and had high hopes for it. I was expecting something along the lines of Outlaw Star, but with more camp and parody along the lines of Excel Saga thrown in. What really happens is you get a serious drama, led by a bafoon along the lines of Jack Tripper or Frank Drebin as the lead. And this could have worked so well, and it did on some levels, but there is not enough resolution. I loved the antics of the marines and the pilot (why there was only one starfighter pilot seemed odd to me). I loved the fact that the enemy was actually a competant enemy and that the stakes were actually high, and lives really on the line. But it annoyed me that Tylor really was an idiot, and never got it, even in the end. Once the climax actually came, he never became more then he was to start with, and so many people were disapointed and love lost. In the end, I felt as if it were all for nothing, but I understand this was only the beginning and much more of the series follows. But I don't know if I have the faith in Tylor to invest more into the series, because of what I have seen so far. I feel like one of the disapointed crew of the Soyokaze.",3,An epic saga with a bumbling lead.,1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,1168,"['heard', 'lot', 'one', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'lines', 'Outlaw', 'Star', 'more', 'camp', 'parody', 'lines', 'Excel', 'Saga', 'thrown', 'What', 'really', 'get', 'serious', 'drama', 'led', 'bafoon', 'lines', 'Jack', 'Tripper', 'Frank', 'Drebin', 'lead', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'did', 'levels', 'not', 'enough', 'resolution', 'loved', 'antics', 'marines', 'pilot', 'why', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'starfighter', 'pilot', 'seemed', 'odd', 'loved', 'fact', 'enemy', 'was', 'actually', 'competant', 'enemy', 'stakes', 'were', 'actually', 'high', 'really', 'line', 'annoyed', 'Tylor', 'really', 'was', 'idiot', 'never', 'got', 'even', 'end', 'climax', 'actually', 'came', 'never', 'became', 'more', 'then', 'was', 'start', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'disapointed', 'love', 'lost', 'end', 'felt', 'were', 'nothing', 'understand', 'was', 'only', 'beginning', 'much', 'more', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'have', 'faith', 'Tylor', 'invest', 'more', 'series', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'feel', 'one', 'disapointed', 'crew', 'Soyokaze']",Irresponsible Captain Tylor - Collection

As it says on the cover, he is &quot;either a certified genius or a complete fool, but no one can really tell.&quot;The series itself is equal parts funny, sad, thought provoking, sweet, romantic and nostalgic.  There is nothing unique about these elements other than perhaps the way they all work together to make one of the best anime series I have ever seen.  Each of the characters are rounded out and developed, and you just get to LIKE them all so much that it is sad when the last episode plays.  Not because anything bad happens to them so much as you will miss them.I consider this series to be on par with Neon Genesis Evangelion in terms of sheer quality.  That's a pretty good recommendation.",5,The right mix of everything,989884800,"05 15, 2001",2001,836,"['pretty', 'hard', 'categorize', 'quot', 'Irresponsible', 'Captain', 'Tylor', 'quot', 'just', 'hard', 'pin', 'down', 'Justy', 'Ueki', 'Tylor', 'cover', 'quot', 'certified', 'genius', 'complete', 'fool', 'one', 'can', 'really', 'tell.', 'quot', 'series', 'equal', 'parts', 'funny', 'sad', 'thought', 'provoking', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'nostalgic', 'nothing', 'unique', 'elements', 'other', 'perhaps', 'way', 'work', 'together', 'make', 'one', 'best', 'anime', 'series', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'characters', 'are', 'rounded', 'out', 'developed', 'just', 'get', 'LIKE', 'so', 'much', 'sad', 'when', 'last', 'episode', 'plays', 'Not', 'anything', 'bad', 'so', 'much', 'will', 'miss', 'them.I', 'consider', 'series', 'be', 'par', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'terms', 'sheer', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'recommendation']",Irresponsible Captain Tylor - Collection
