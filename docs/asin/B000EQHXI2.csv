The last five episodes of season one weren't run until season 2. But they are included on Season 1. For season 2, 17 new episodes were produced. This was also their last complete season on Fox as the third season had them swap over to the WB after only 3 episodes.  This is one of those shows that deserves a DVD release since it was nearly impossible to follow the show when it was broadcast.

You would first see the outcome of said adventure and then go backwards to find out what happened a long the way. This was a very different approach.

977359,A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I,B000EQHXI2,Veil_Lord,"[1, 1]","This is one of those shows that was kind of overlooked in its day. It was never top of the heap, but it was well produced and well acted. Season one was fresh, interesting, and I loved all the episodes.  At it's heart it's pure to what a ""sitcom"" is; it's a ""situation comedy"".  I very much like the style of story telling where they generally start in the middle and then bits get filled in as you go.  It's sort of like that old Seinfeld episode they did in reverse.Season two isn't quite pure gold likeSeason 1was, which is to be expected with more episodes.  That's not to say that there are a lot of bad ones, but there were a couple that I just skipped over; to me the gay episode was just forced and tedious.  The cast remains the same, with the addition of Lily's new boyfriend who gets the screen time that the next door neighbor boy used to get. He's this drummer that I just didn't like for some reason. It's probably just me, but something about him was offputting. I liked the dorky neighbor better.  He isn't gone completely, just not shown as much.  If you didn't like him, it's a plus I suppose.Even with one or two episodes that didn't pass muster, the vast majority of the season is great. For some reason they seem to be releasing a much cheaper price than their initial release. For the price you can get them now, this is completely a no-brainer. Buy the DVDs, you'll get WAY more fun than their cost.If you like this series, you may also want to check outTitus.
