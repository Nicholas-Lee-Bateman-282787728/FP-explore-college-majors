737920,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00008CMSU,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[17, 18]","Based on John Groberg's autobiography ""In the Eye of the Storm,"" this story of a Mormon missionary's years in the Tongan islands is exceptional. With a strong faith-based message, it has a mix of heroism, pathos, and a good deal of humor that is truly funny because of its natural and real nature. ""The Other Side of Heaven"" gives us the sense of what it might be like to arrive in a strange land and adjust to the drastic changes in culture, language, diet and living conditions, and the loneliness of being thousands of miles from home. Born in Idaho, John attends the Brigham Young University, and the film starts out in 1953, with him playing the trumpet for a dance, where we meet his true love Jean. There is narration throughout the film of their letters over the course of the 3 years they are separated, and his devotion to Jean is one of the factors that help him endure the many hardships he faces.Written and Directed by Mitch Davis, with a cast that includes non-professionals, the cinematography by Brian Breheny is often spectacular; filmed in Rarotonga (Cook Islands) and Auckland, New Zealand, the seascapes and sunsets are glorious, and the lovely score by Kevin Kiner adds to the beauty of the film. Christopher Gorham is wonderful as John; he has just the right blend of innocence, sincerity, and strength to carry the many aspects of the drama, and Anne Hathaway is good as Jean. Also outstanding are Joseph Folau as Feki, John's friend and assistant, and Paki Cherrington as the minister. Some have labeled ""The Other Side of Heaven"" as ""Mormon propaganda,"" but there is little mention of Mormonism in the film, instead it's a story of great human courage, man's ability to adapt and recover from devastating events, and a love that endures. The film ends with photographs of the real people in the story, and what became of them in later years, and it is a nice finishing touch to a film that is excellent family entertainment. Total running time is 113 minutes.",5,"""Find Your Life by Losing It""",1128643200,"10 7, 2005",2005,1985,"['Based', 'John', 'Groberg', 'autobiography', 'Eye', 'Storm', 'story', 'Mormon', 'missionary', 'years', 'Tongan', 'exceptional', 'strong', 'faith-based', 'message', 'mix', 'heroism', 'pathos', 'good', 'deal', 'humor', 'truly', 'funny', 'natural', 'real', 'nature', 'Other', 'Side', 'Heaven', 'sense', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'arrive', 'strange', 'land', 'adjust', 'drastic', 'changes', 'culture', 'language', 'diet', 'living', 'conditions', 'loneliness', 'being', 'thousands', 'miles', 'home', 'Born', 'Idaho', 'John', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'University', 'film', 'out', '1953', 'playing', 'trumpet', 'dance', 'where', 'meet', 'true', 'love', 'Jean', 'narration', 'film', 'letters', 'course', '3', 'years', 'are', 'separated', 'devotion', 'Jean', 'one', 'factors', 'help', 'endure', 'many', 'hardships', 'faces.Written', 'Directed', 'Mitch', 'Davis', 'cast', 'non-professionals', 'cinematography', 'Brian', 'Breheny', 'often', 'spectacular', 'filmed', 'Rarotonga', 'Cook', 'Islands', 'Auckland', 'New', 'Zealand', 'seascapes', 'sunsets', 'are', 'glorious', 'lovely', 'score', 'Kevin', 'Kiner', 'beauty', 'film', 'Christopher', 'Gorham', 'wonderful', 'John', 'just', 'right', 'blend', 'innocence', 'sincerity', 'strength', 'carry', 'many', 'aspects', 'drama', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'good', 'Jean', 'Also', 'outstanding', 'are', 'Joseph', 'Folau', 'Feki', 'John', 'friend', 'assistant', 'Paki', 'Cherrington', 'minister', 'have', 'labeled', 'Other', 'Side', 'Heaven', 'Mormon', 'propaganda', 'little', 'mention', 'Mormonism', 'film', 'instead', 'story', 'great', 'human', 'courage', 'man', 'ability', 'adapt', 'recover', 'devastating', 'events', 'love', 'film', 'photographs', 'real', 'people', 'story', 'what', 'became', 'later', 'years', 'nice', 'finishing', 'touch', 'film', 'excellent', 'family', 'entertainment', 'Total', 'running', 'time', '113', 'minutes']",N/A

I did not pick up that it was Mormon-based in its theology, for I saw in this film the heart of a dedicated man who gave his life to share truth.  This, I believe, is the thrust of every true Missionary.  I appreciated the way the humbleness and the innerstrength of the man was portrayed as he faced mosquitos, rats, lust, and hurricanes.

737922,AHCVWPLA1O4X8,B00008CMSU,bixodoido,"[25, 30]","Sure, this movie is about a Mormon missionary.  That fact, for some reason, is enough in-and-of-itself to scare many people away (and I can see why, after watching the abominable movie ""God's Army,"" which stuffs, rams, and forces Mormonism down your throat by trying to make the missionaries seem like just 'one of the guys').  In this film, however, it is not young Elder Groberg's religion which is important--rather it is his selfless service and message of hope and love which make this film what it is.  In fact, Disney does a great job of keeping references to Mormonism to a minimum, instead keeping the message one which all Christians should be able to relate to.Groberg has some interesting experiences in his three years in Tonga--death, disease, natural disasters, and many other events mold not only him but the community at large.  He struggles with the language and has both difficulties and triumphs in his work.  At times, it seems he must take on the whole world, but each time he meets the challenge head-on with a fierce determination and a courage which are extremely admirable.Above all, this is a message about faith.  It doesn't matter your religion, this movie will move and inspire you if you let it.  It doesn't push Mormonism on anyone, and that is perhaps what makes it so powerful.  The impact would be the same if the missionary were from any other faith.  I cannot praise this movie enough, nor recommend it sufficiently to anyone who wants of be uplifted and enlightened by a courageous story of faith.",5,"A movie about faith, without denominational overtones",1052352000,"05 8, 2003",2003,1535,"['Sure', 'movie', 'Mormon', 'missionary', 'fact', 'reason', 'enough', 'in-and-of-itself', 'scare', 'many', 'people', 'away', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'watching', 'abominable', 'movie', 'God', 'Army', 'stuffs', 'rams', 'forces', 'Mormonism', 'down', 'throat', 'trying', 'make', 'missionaries', 'seem', 'just', ""'one"", 'guys', 'film', 'however', 'not', 'young', 'Elder', 'Groberg', 'religion', 'important', 'rather', 'selfless', 'service', 'message', 'hope', 'love', 'make', 'film', 'what', 'fact', 'Disney', 'great', 'job', 'keeping', 'references', 'Mormonism', 'minimum', 'instead', 'keeping', 'message', 'one', 'Christians', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'to.Groberg', 'interesting', 'experiences', 'three', 'years', 'Tonga', 'death', 'disease', 'natural', 'disasters', 'many', 'other', 'events', 'mold', 'not', 'only', 'community', 'large', 'language', 'difficulties', 'triumphs', 'work', 'times', 'must', 'take', 'whole', 'world', 'time', 'challenge', 'head-on', 'fierce', 'determination', 'courage', 'are', 'extremely', 'message', 'faith', ""n't"", 'matter', 'religion', 'movie', 'will', 'move', 'inspire', 'let', ""n't"", 'push', 'Mormonism', 'anyone', 'perhaps', 'what', 'so', 'powerful', 'impact', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'missionary', 'were', 'other', 'faith', 'can', 'not', 'praise', 'movie', 'enough', 'recommend', 'sufficiently', 'anyone', 'who', 'be', 'uplifted', 'enlightened', 'courageous', 'story', 'faith']",N/A

I can only ask you to step out of your ignorance on the subject and take an open-minded and open-hearted look at &quot;Mormonism&quot;.  Having served an honorable LDS mission I can empathize with some of the difficulties faced by Elder Groberg.  I have read some negative reviews here saying many things portrayed in the film were unbelievable.

Great cinematography, pretty good acting, a fine score, and a great book to based on (""In The Eye of the Storm"" now renamed ""The Other Side of Heaven""). However, it is not a perfect movie.Mitch Davis has done a good enough job with the screenplay but the man needs some help directing. Sure, the performances are fine, but the pacing needs some serious help. It's the same mild-mannered pace from beginning to end. Even in the face of danger, we are faced with the same pacing.And, when watching this, you have to wonder if this is a step back for LDS stories on the silver screen? Richard Dutcher has created hard-core and GRITTY films about a faith that is overall a mystery to the majority of the earth (even to many of the members.) No grit in this movie though. It's the same peaceful feeling from beginning to end. Too bad.But with all of these problems, it was still a very entertaining movie.

Bernabo,"[5, 7]","Writer-Director Mitch Davis was a Mormon missionary to Argentina in the 1970s, so it is not surprising that he would be attracted to the story of John Groberg, who left his home in Idaho Falls at the age of 19 to travel to the South Pacific achipelago of the Kingdom of Tonga for his three year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Davis's script is based on Elder Groberg's 1993 memoir, ""In the Eye of the Storm,"" and the story that ends up on the screen is your basic stranger in a stranger land tale.  Of course it takes place on a gorgeous island in the South Pacific, so there is exotic local.  But while Grober is a Mormon missionary this film is largely a nondenominational tale of Christian missionary work (I wonder if that phrase is redundant or if there are non-Christian missionaries; obviously I consider Mormons to be Christians, and I understand some would debate the point, but I do not see how such a disticntion matters to this film).We are introduced to young John Groberg (Christopher Gorham) he is playing trumpet at a swing party at Brigham Young University watching his girl, Jean Sabin (Anne Hathaway), dancing with some other guy.  So John finishes his trumpet solo, puts down his horn, and jumps down to do some serious rug cutting with Jean.  She is the rock he will be leaving behind, although the exact nature of their understanding is unclear, and despite the fact that is will take months for them to exchange letters.  That is how long it takes Groberg to get to his post on the island of Niuatoputap (pay attention to the lines he draws on the map to pick up on how he really does take the long way round).  Groberg is accompanied by Feki (Joseph Folau), who can help translate for the young missionary and save him from some embarassment over what is being said about him and what he is saying in his first speech in the native language.There are problems to overcome and not just in terms of the language (this is one of those films where as soon as the main character learns the native tongue everybody starts speaking English).  The island already has a minister who warns the people against listening to the missionary and it turns out that sleeping with your feet uncovered is not a good idea.  Of course, Groberg will win over the natives, and we are not surprised that they make as big of an impression on them (the title of the film indicates as much).  But not as much of the film is about Groberg's missionary work as you might think (the key moment comes when he finally gets checked up on and is berated because he has not done the proper paperwork for baptizing people and buidling churches).  A lot of it has to do with trying to survive hurricanes and shipwrecks, not to mention some local customs that serve to remind how much of a different world he is living in now.  The letters back and forth between John and Jean are not as much as I anticipated, but we do appreciate how she is his rock and that heaven is not just returning to her to live happily ever after.  It is getting her to live with him in paradise.",4,Young Elder John Groberg becomes a missionary to Tonga,1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,3090,"['Writer-Director', 'Mitch', 'Davis', 'was', 'Mormon', 'missionary', 'Argentina', '1970s', 'not', 'surprising', 'would', 'be', 'attracted', 'story', 'John', 'Groberg', 'who', 'left', 'home', 'Idaho', 'Falls', 'age', '19', 'travel', 'South', 'Pacific', 'achipelago', 'Kingdom', 'Tonga', 'three', 'year', 'mission', 'Church', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Latter-day', 'Saints', 'Davis', 'script', 'based', 'Elder', 'Groberg', '1993', 'memoir', 'Eye', 'Storm', 'story', 'up', 'screen', 'basic', 'stranger', 'stranger', 'land', 'tale', 'course', 'place', 'gorgeous', 'island', 'South', 'Pacific', 'exotic', 'local', 'Grober', 'Mormon', 'missionary', 'film', 'largely', 'nondenominational', 'tale', 'Christian', 'missionary', 'work', 'wonder', 'phrase', 'redundant', 'are', 'non-Christian', 'missionaries', 'obviously', 'consider', 'Mormons', 'be', 'Christians', 'understand', 'would', 'debate', 'point', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'such', 'disticntion', 'matters', 'film', '.We', 'are', 'introduced', 'young', 'John', 'Groberg', 'Christopher', 'Gorham', 'playing', 'trumpet', 'swing', 'party', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'University', 'watching', 'girl', 'Jean', 'Sabin', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'dancing', 'other', 'guy', 'So', 'John', 'trumpet', 'solo', 'down', 'horn', 'down', 'do', 'serious', 'rug', 'cutting', 'Jean', 'rock', 'will', 'be', 'leaving', 'exact', 'nature', 'understanding', 'unclear', 'fact', 'will', 'take', 'months', 'exchange', 'letters', 'how', 'long', 'Groberg', 'get', 'post', 'island', 'Niuatoputap', 'pay', 'attention', 'lines', 'map', 'pick', 'up', 'how', 'really', 'take', 'long', 'way', 'round', 'Groberg', 'accompanied', 'Feki', 'Joseph', 'Folau', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'translate', 'young', 'missionary', 'save', 'embarassment', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'what', 'saying', 'first', 'speech', 'native', 'are', 'problems', 'overcome', 'not', 'just', 'terms', 'language', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'as', 'soon', 'main', 'character', 'native', 'tongue', 'everybody', 'speaking', 'English', 'island', 'already', 'minister', 'who', 'people', 'listening', 'missionary', 'out', 'sleeping', 'feet', 'uncovered', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'course', 'Groberg', 'will', 'win', 'natives', 'are', 'not', 'surprised', 'make', 'big', 'impression', 'title', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'much', 'film', 'Groberg', 'missionary', 'work', 'might', 'think', 'key', 'moment', 'when', 'finally', 'checked', 'up', 'berated', 'not', 'done', 'proper', 'paperwork', 'baptizing', 'people', 'buidling', 'churches', 'lot', 'do', 'trying', 'survive', 'hurricanes', 'shipwrecks', 'not', 'mention', 'local', 'customs', 'serve', 'remind', 'how', 'much', 'different', 'world', 'living', 'now', 'letters', 'back', 'forth', 'John', 'Jean', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'anticipated', 'do', 'appreciate', 'how', 'rock', 'heaven', 'not', 'just', 'returning', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'getting', 'live', 'paradise']",N/A

He battles natural elements, struggles with being away from his school sweetheart, learns another language without formal training, struggles with other religious leaders who distrust him, and, most hilariously, he wins over a paper-pushing bureaucrat from his own faith tradition.  Perhaps the most powerful element of the story is that a barely twenty-year-old caucasion male from Idaho who goes to a foreign land to bring Western religion could be portrayed sympathetically by Hollywood.I also spent several years overseas doing religious work.  Although I am not Mormon, and my experiences were not a dramatic is the young man's in this movie, there were many similarities.  It was gratifying to see such a positive and realistic story being brought to the big screen.Bottom-line:  This is a great movie--suitable for viewing by upper-elementary school children and older.
