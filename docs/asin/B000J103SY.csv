I find that cute & classy at the same time. Hope to catch him in person someday.,5,Ralphie!!

His brand of comedy is definitely not politically correct.  It is however very funny.

While I have not followed his career very closely I purchased ""Girth of A Nation"" after I saw it on Comedy Central.  It's rude, tacky, picks on people whom are mentally challenged, and is just a mess of how life really is.  This sort of reminds me of the late Sam Kinison who was way out there for sure.  Ralphie does his best at showing how real life can be looked at from a less serious side.  ""Girth of a Nation"" will having you whispering to yourself, ""did he just say what I thought he said.""
