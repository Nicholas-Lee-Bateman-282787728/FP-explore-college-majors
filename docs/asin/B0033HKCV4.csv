For the first time in a very long time I see that the people opting ""against"" this movie seem to have it right. I love Stephen King and this is one of the his short stories I have enjoyed a lot so naturally I got overjoyed when I found out they had made a movie out of it. Sad to say the joy just ended there. The movie is a sad excuse of an effort that never managed to capture the sense of desperation, pain and humanity of the story. The actors are all cartoonish (especially Slater's) wrong, too young, too detached, too out of place. I guess Hollywood's ""adversion"" to old age is too pervasive to overcome.In the story you get the exact feeling of what the Robinsons have and what they lost. In the movie the scenes before tragedy struck are just too mundane and unconvincing to covney the sense of desperate Mr. Robinson must have felt after losing his wife. It would be more believable if he just pocketed the insurance money and moved in with another woman shortly after. Slater is absolutely wrong as Dolan and the rest of the actors just look like they are just there to get this done quickly and go their way.A small anecdote: I watched the ""Behind the wheel of Dolan's Cadillac"" special feature and at one point they refer to Slater as a ""Hollywood Legend""! Well guys and girls although I really like Slater as an actor and I have enjoyed a lot of his movies (especially True Romance) but a Hollywood Legend he is NOT by any stretch of the imagination. Leave this camp to Brando, De Niro, Streep, even Harrison Ford and other true legends.Back to the movie now, as I said, it might be entertaining to some, especially if they have not read the story but it falls short in virtually all departments like cohesion, acting, believability etc.I wonder why King does not have more say in the making (or un-making) of his books.",2,Moronic a la Hollywood style!,1334620800,"04 17, 2012",2012,1869,"['Two', 'stars', 'am', 'being', 'generous', 'first', 'time', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'see', 'people', 'opting', 'movie', 'seem', 'have', 'right', 'love', 'Stephen', 'King', 'one', 'short', 'stories', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'naturally', 'got', 'overjoyed', 'when', 'found', 'had', 'made', 'movie', 'Sad', 'say', 'joy', 'just', 'ended', 'there', 'movie', 'sad', 'excuse', 'effort', 'never', 'managed', 'capture', 'sense', 'desperation', 'pain', 'humanity', 'story', 'actors', 'are', 'cartoonish', 'especially', 'Slater', 'wrong', 'too', 'young', 'too', 'detached', 'too', 'place', 'guess', 'Hollywood', 'adversion', 'old', 'age', 'too', 'pervasive', 'overcome.In', 'story', 'get', 'exact', 'feeling', 'what', 'Robinsons', 'have', 'what', 'lost', 'movie', 'scenes', 'tragedy', 'struck', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'mundane', 'unconvincing', 'covney', 'sense', 'desperate', 'Mr.', 'Robinson', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'losing', 'wife', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'believable', 'just', 'pocketed', 'insurance', 'money', 'moved', 'woman', 'shortly', 'Slater', 'absolutely', 'wrong', 'Dolan', 'rest', 'actors', 'just', 'look', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'get', 'done', 'quickly', 'go', 'way.A', 'small', 'anecdote', 'watched', 'wheel', 'Dolan', 'Cadillac', 'special', 'feature', 'one', 'point', 'refer', 'Slater', 'Hollywood', 'Legend', 'Well', 'guys', 'girls', 'really', 'like', 'Slater', 'actor', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'movies', 'especially', 'True', 'Romance', 'Hollywood', 'Legend', 'NOT', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'Leave', 'camp', 'Brando', 'De', 'Niro', 'Streep', 'even', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'other', 'true', 'legends.Back', 'movie', 'now', 'said', 'might', 'be', 'entertaining', 'especially', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'story', 'short', 'virtually', 'departments', 'cohesion', 'acting', 'believability', 'etc.I', 'wonder', 'why', 'King', 'not', 'have', 'more', 'say', 'making', 'un-making', 'books']",N/A

I absolutely loved the original Stephen King short story.  The movie took many liberties with the story, which is understandable considering the media transition.  I'm moving this up to five stars from four.  I was originally disappointed with some of the directors liberties changing the story, but I've decided to look at this as a ""Re-imagining"" instead of Dolan's Cadillac the short story.The acting was great, we don't see enough Christian Slater these days, the cast a whole did well.  It's pretty obvious throughout the whole movie it didn't have a huge budget, but the director made up for the lack of budget with quality work and an artistic approach, and it worked very well.  This is part of my five star decision, it's obvious they made a good movie with few resources.  The bonus material on the disk confirms many of the actors were on board not for the money, but because they liked the story and the project as a whole.  That in and of itself helps to make a movie good.If you like movies that get into a characters head, like About Schmidt, if you like movies of vengeance or movies of technical accomplishment like the Goonies this might appeal to you for one reason or another.

I still remember reading the film's story title ""Dolan's Cadillac"" when I was young in that great collection ""Everything's Eventual"" and never forgetting the sheer macabre subtlety with which King ends the cool, chilling tale of an ordinary man's revenge on a top mobster who had his wife murdered for testifying against him as a witness to a crime.Wes Bentley (Robinson, recalling well Weldon Kee's disillusioned, angry poetic persona) is a sixth grade schoolteacher with a relatively happy life and a lovely wife who teaches at the same school.  They live around Las Vegas and one day, while she is horseriding around the desert, she witnesses the thuggish, brutal Christian Slater execute a fellow henchmen for not delivering his ""sex slave product"" on time.  She drops her cellphone, and though they are given witness protection, she is killed with a car bomb.No, Robinson is not as bald as in the story and yes it departs from the text quite a bit--but in the end, perhaps for a little innovative creativity.  When Robinson devises his most cruel trap--a tarpaulin facade on the highway which is in reality a huge ditch meant for Dolan's (Christian Slater) and he falls in, the dialogue is worthy of some of the finest literature we have--in some parts hammy, in other parts superior to King's ending itself, though he was aiming for a more obsessive and subtle approach.  Edgar Allan Poe is in the air, to be certain.  The question of revenge, particularly this sort of elaborately devised and sinister sort, is explored with exquisite detail as the two characters scream at each other, one buried in the desert with nothing but a gun he can no longer use, and one with a conscience that is being severely tested.

Everyone loves good revenge movies....unfortunately, this one is just not very good.Problem No. 1 is that it is adapted from a Stephen King short story. I enjoy Stephen King novels, but never cease to be disappointed by screen adaptations of them. Somehow my imagination, while reading, is always way more scary and inventive that the visual interpretation provided by a movie studio. This one is no exception.No. 2 is that Christian Slater overacts, in this movie, to a degree that is always distracting and often comical. He can portray a cold-blooded maniac quite well (see him in True Romance), but his supposed satanic viciousness in this opus is conveyed by a lot of yelling, ""hard"" looks at the camera, and unconvincing tough-guy dialog. At no time does he ever appear truly dangerous or psychotic. Instead, he comes off as a very well dressed, baby-faced, loud-mouthed, overconfident, silly little guy. As testimony to this, we are told (the weakest of all expository methods) how bad Dolan is....twice. To be honest, I think he was cast for his marquee appeal rather than for being appropriate for the part.No. 3 is Wes Bentley's eyebrows. These things have a life of their own. They look like giant black caterpillars hovering over dark, psychotic eyes. They are all I ever see when I look at him, and its probably just as well, because his acting is generally at a ""made for TV"" level. He looked far scarier than Christian Slater at all times, however, and would have made a far more convincing villain than ""common man"".No. 4 is the conclusion. SPOILER ALERT.....How is this crime ever going to go undetected? The first car that passed over the cut-up asphalt would compress it and sink a foot or so, or simply stop to see why the road looked like a jigsaw puzzle. How did Wes construct this elaborate trap in such a short period of time? Where did he put all the dirt? What are the odds that Dolan's car would pass this spot at exactly the right time? Why didn't Wes just pave over it? He had all the equipment at hand. To be honest, this ending just reeked of Stephen King: an overly elaborate, completely incredible solution to a very basic problem. It was the climax of the whole movie, and I was not impressed.Some other review of this movie are extremely flattering, but I tend to be  suspicious that wild praise of something truly mediocre may be due to ulterior motives. It is not badly made, the sound and photography are quite good, and portions of the plot are definitely watchable, particularly the parts involving Emmanuele Vaugier.I have watched hundreds of movies in my life and know a good one when I see it. Whether the movie suits my personal taste or not, true quality shows through and is undeniable. Please believe me, unless you are very young and/or very naive, this is simply a very mediocre movie.",3,Disappointing on Many Levels.....Don't Spend Much Money to Watch It,1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,2981,"['synopsis', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'average', 'man', 'wife', 'murdered', 'fearsome', 'gangster', 'wimpy', 'husband', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'revenge', 'Everyone', 'good', 'revenge', 'movies', '.unfortunately', 'one', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good.Problem', 'No', '1', 'adapted', 'Stephen', 'King', 'short', 'story', 'enjoy', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novels', 'never', 'cease', 'be', 'disappointed', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'Somehow', 'imagination', 'reading', 'always', 'way', 'more', 'scary', 'inventive', 'visual', 'interpretation', 'provided', 'movie', 'studio', 'one', 'exception.No', '2', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'overacts', 'movie', 'degree', 'always', 'distracting', 'often', 'comical', 'can', 'portray', 'cold-blooded', 'maniac', 'quite', 'well', 'see', 'True', 'Romance', 'supposed', 'satanic', 'viciousness', 'opus', 'conveyed', 'lot', 'yelling', 'hard', 'camera', 'unconvincing', 'tough-guy', 'dialog', 'time', 'ever', 'appear', 'truly', 'dangerous', 'psychotic', 'Instead', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'dressed', 'baby-faced', 'loud-mouthed', 'overconfident', 'silly', 'little', 'guy', 'testimony', 'are', 'told', 'weakest', 'expository', 'methods', 'how', 'bad', 'Dolan', '.twice', 'be', 'honest', 'think', 'was', 'cast', 'marquee', 'appeal', 'rather', 'being', 'appropriate', 'part.No', '3', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'eyebrows', 'things', 'have', 'life', 'own', 'look', 'giant', 'black', 'caterpillars', 'hovering', 'dark', 'psychotic', 'eyes', 'are', 'ever', 'see', 'when', 'look', 'probably', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'generally', 'made', 'TV', 'level', 'looked', 'far', 'scarier', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'times', 'however', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'far', 'more', 'convincing', 'villain', 'common', 'man', '.No', '4', 'conclusion', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', '..How', 'crime', 'ever', 'going', 'go', 'undetected', 'first', 'car', 'passed', 'cut-up', 'asphalt', 'would', 'compress', 'sink', 'foot', 'so', 'simply', 'stop', 'see', 'why', 'road', 'looked', 'jigsaw', 'puzzle', 'How', 'did', 'Wes', 'construct', 'elaborate', 'trap', 'such', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'Where', 'did', 'put', 'dirt', 'What', 'are', 'odds', 'Dolan', 'car', 'would', 'pass', 'spot', 'exactly', 'right', 'time', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Wes', 'just', 'pave', 'had', 'equipment', 'hand', 'be', 'honest', 'ending', 'just', 'reeked', 'Stephen', 'King', 'overly', 'elaborate', 'completely', 'incredible', 'solution', 'very', 'basic', 'problem', 'was', 'climax', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'impressed.Some', 'other', 'review', 'movie', 'are', 'extremely', 'flattering', 'tend', 'be', 'suspicious', 'wild', 'praise', 'something', 'truly', 'mediocre', 'may', 'be', 'due', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'not', 'badly', 'made', 'sound', 'photography', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'portions', 'plot', 'are', 'definitely', 'watchable', 'particularly', 'parts', 'involving', 'Emmanuele', 'Vaugier.I', 'have', 'watched', 'hundreds', 'movies', 'life', 'know', 'good', 'one', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'suits', 'personal', 'taste', 'not', 'true', 'quality', 'shows', 'undeniable', 'Please', 'believe', 'are', 'very', 'young', 'and/or', 'very', 'naive', 'simply', 'very', 'mediocre', 'movie']",N/A
