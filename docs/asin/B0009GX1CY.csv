It's dirty with scratches and spots and dropouts. Plus, it's only in full-frame format. NO WIDESCREEN!I gave it 1 star because of Gene Hackman's performance but for me, it's unwatchable.The tragedy is that this may be the only transfer done of this movie, since it's not a block buster.COME ON GUYS, LET'S SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME ON THESE MOVIES!

This is an excellent movie and it really mystifies me as to what took so long for it to be released on DVD when so much plastic is committed to garbage every week for movies that were better left to deteriorate on film (and were a waste of that film to begin with).This is one of Gene Hackman's lesser known movies but he did a wonderful job of acting, as a long-time married man who meets a new woman bartender (Ann Margaret) on his birthday and begins an affair with her.  The film deals with the complications of Hackman's and Margaret's new found love as well as guilt, along with the anguish it causes his wife (Ellyn Burnstyn) and kids.  Perhaps Amy Madigan's acting as Hackman's forever-angry daughter is a bit over the top but I felt all of the acting was superb, as was the script.  True, adultery is not an acceptable behavior but it happens and in this movie we see the temptations that led to this happening, as well as the effect is has on everyone in a very realistic and emotional portrayal.As an aside, I also enjoyed the bits of Pat Metheny's music that was used in the score.  This is a ""talky"" movie and contained too much profanity for my tastes but I also thought it fit with the movie.  Now that it is on DVD I am looking forward to its release because this is one of my favorites, and I prefer DVD over VHS.  Highly recommended if you are a fan of relationship movies.",5,Finally on DVD - Great!,1118016000,"06 6, 2005",2005,1467,"['saw', 'theater', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'also', 'purchased', 'VHS', 'excellent', 'movie', 'really', 'what', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'plastic', 'committed', 'garbage', 'week', 'movies', 'were', 'better', 'left', 'deteriorate', 'film', 'were', 'waste', 'film', 'begin', '.This', 'one', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'lesser', 'known', 'movies', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'acting', 'long-time', 'married', 'man', 'who', 'new', 'woman', 'bartender', 'Ann', 'Margaret', 'birthday', 'affair', 'film', 'deals', 'complications', 'Hackman', 'Margaret', 'new', 'found', 'love', 'as', 'well', 'guilt', 'anguish', 'wife', 'Ellyn', 'Burnstyn', 'kids', 'Perhaps', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'acting', 'Hackman', 'forever-angry', 'daughter', 'bit', 'top', 'felt', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'was', 'script', 'True', 'adultery', 'not', 'acceptable', 'behavior', 'movie', 'see', 'temptations', 'led', 'happening', 'as', 'well', 'effect', 'everyone', 'very', 'realistic', 'emotional', 'portrayal.As', 'aside', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'bits', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'music', 'was', 'used', 'score', 'talky', 'movie', 'contained', 'too', 'much', 'profanity', 'tastes', 'also', 'thought', 'fit', 'movie', 'Now', 'DVD', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'release', 'one', 'favorites', 'prefer', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'are', 'fan', 'relationship', 'movies']",Twice in a Lifetime

I bought it for only one reason I wanted to See Snohomish on film.

He doesn't have a romantic persona on screen, but somehow he carries off a believable middle-age romance with Ann Margret in Twice in a Lifetime.
