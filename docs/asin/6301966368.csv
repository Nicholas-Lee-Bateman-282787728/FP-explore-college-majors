276995,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6301966368,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 15]","I read some great reviews that got me interested and excited about this film, but it just never happened. I had trouble following the story and the characters.  I will admit, Heard's Cutter was outstanding.  I was surprised that he was not up for an award for his role in this film, but Bridges just seemed to lack on every level.  Unless he is handed an exceptional script, Bridges plays the same sort of character over and over again.  I also had trouble with the female character of Mo in this film. It was never really understood what her relationship was to everyone until I read some reviews, which then made sense.I also had trouble with Cutter's physical condition.  It seemed like he was fully able to do everything, except sleep with his wife, as a normal person would. I guess that was the point.  Create a character that is so believable that you don't see the physical condition. Too bad I did.  I really wanted him to lift up his eye-patch to reveal to us that perhaps he was none other than One-Eyed Willy himself.  That would have been a perfect twist.There were gaping holes in this film as well.  The plot seemed to jump around without any explanation. I needed more story on who the friend was and his connection to J.J. Cord.  The girl that follows Bone and Cutter around seems to have disappeared midway through the film and it was her battle they were fighting. The only redeeming aspect of this film was the ending.  My decent review of this film was dependent on the ending and it succeeded.  The ending leaves all of it up to the viewer.  The imagination can play wonders with this and I think it can be interpreted in anyway. I especially loved reading about the Hamlet reference that I didn't see it until now, but it makes perfect sense. That is why I watch these films. I want to see how other people see life and their representation on camera.Overall, Cutter's Way was not a great film, but the ending redeemed itself in someway that I will never be able to explain.Grade:  *** out of *****",3,Cuts through nothing.,1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,2021,"['read', 'great', 'reviews', 'got', 'interested', 'excited', 'film', 'just', 'never', 'happened', 'had', 'trouble', 'following', 'story', 'characters', 'will', 'admit', 'Heard', 'Cutter', 'was', 'outstanding', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'award', 'role', 'film', 'Bridges', 'just', 'seemed', 'lack', 'level', 'handed', 'exceptional', 'script', 'Bridges', 'same', 'sort', 'character', 'over', 'again', 'also', 'had', 'trouble', 'female', 'character', 'Mo', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'understood', 'what', 'relationship', 'was', 'everyone', 'read', 'reviews', 'then', 'made', 'sense.I', 'also', 'had', 'trouble', 'Cutter', 'physical', 'condition', 'seemed', 'was', 'fully', 'able', 'do', 'everything', 'sleep', 'wife', 'normal', 'person', 'would', 'guess', 'was', 'point', 'Create', 'character', 'so', 'believable', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'physical', 'condition', 'Too', 'bad', 'did', 'really', 'wanted', 'lift', 'up', 'eye-patch', 'reveal', 'perhaps', 'was', 'none', 'other', 'One-Eyed', 'Willy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'were', 'gaping', 'holes', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'plot', 'seemed', 'jump', 'around', 'explanation', 'needed', 'more', 'story', 'who', 'friend', 'was', 'connection', 'J.J.', 'Cord', 'girl', 'Bone', 'Cutter', 'around', 'have', 'disappeared', 'midway', 'film', 'was', 'battle', 'were', 'fighting', 'only', 'redeeming', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'ending', 'decent', 'review', 'film', 'was', 'dependent', 'ending', 'succeeded', 'ending', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'can', 'play', 'wonders', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'interpreted', 'anyway', 'especially', 'loved', 'reading', 'Hamlet', 'reference', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'now', 'perfect', 'sense', 'why', 'watch', 'films', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'other', 'people', 'see', 'life', 'representation', 'camera.Overall', 'Cutter', 'Way', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'ending', 'redeemed', 'someway', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'explain.Grade', '***', '*****']",N/A
276996,AGEIT17HENDIS,6301966368,Alfred Johnson,"[3, 3]","In a recent review of ""Crazy Hearts"", the vehicle for Jeff Bridges' Oscar-winning performance as down and out country singer/songwriter Bad Blake, I noted that, in a sense, he had been preparing for and playing up to, in one form or another, that role since the start of his career. The line from Duane in ""The Last Picture Show"" to Bad in ""Crazy"", although not a straight, one-dimensional line, has exhibited some familiar mannerism and acting tics. Like, for example, that sense that you come away with after watching Bridges, or rather his characters, that he is always ready to walk away from a bad situation at the drop of a hat. And not look back, and with no regrets. Except, of course, when duty calls for him to ""take it on the chin"" for the good guys. ""Cutter's Way"", a film toward the beginning of Bridges long career is an exemplar of just that idea.In the aftermath of Bridges' Oscar a number of art theaters are putting together and presenting a retrospective of his work.  A local theater in the Boston area is one such venue. ""Cutter's Way, while no means his best work, is worthy of inclusion in such efforts. Here Bridges plays beach bum, hanging-around guy, semi gigolo, Richard Bone, who seeming cannot be moved off a dead pan, dead-center of existence. Except he has this quirky friend, Cutter, a dysfunctional, psychically and physically wounded Vietnam vet looking for a quick hit at success. The plot line here provides amble opportunity for that after Bone is tangentially involved in a murder case. Needless to say old Cutter means to, come hell or high water, get a pay off from a rich guy who seems to have done the deed. And it goes from there.Now here is the odd part.  Bridges puts in an adequate performance as the blas&eacute; roustabout Bone and displays those mannerisms mentioned above that are his trademark. However, old gravelly-voiced, gritty-etched, eye-patched John Heard steals the whole show with his bravado performance. Although Cutter is, in the end, unsuccessful, trying to save his marriage to his long-suffering wife and does not win the prize that he so frantically seeks at that same end able to get Bone off dead-center.

276997,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6301966368,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 3/14Rate: 103/14: Cutter's Way is a brilliantly made picture that features a veteran cripple, seemingly unhinged in his mind, tagging along a swarthy handsome looking guy on a wild goose chase involving two murders. The only problem remains: does one buy his conspiracy theory? I really had a hard time doing so and ended up not believing it. We&#8217;ll never know after that suspenseful ending. The only thing that surprises me about Cutter's Way is that almost nobody received any accolades for their wonderful performances. John Heard is masterful, Jeff Bridges is at the top of his game, Lisa Eichhorn is wonderful, Arthur Rosenberg is a natural, and Ann Dusenberry is seductive. There are so many elements about Cutter's Way that makes it a terrific neo noir, and the downward spiral into a man&#8217;s fantasy is quite disquieting and real at the same time. So, I am surprised that Bone did what he did. Perhaps it might explain a lot why the theory of the dominant partner and the submissive partner is very credible, and charm does go a long way. All in all, Cutter's Way is one of the best films in the noir genre.",5,Cutter's Masterpiece.,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",2014,1132,"['Viewed', '3/14Rate', '103/14', 'Cutter', 'Way', 'brilliantly', 'made', 'picture', 'veteran', 'cripple', 'seemingly', 'unhinged', 'mind', 'tagging', 'along', 'swarthy', 'handsome', 'looking', 'guy', 'wild', 'goose', 'chase', 'involving', 'two', 'murders', 'only', 'problem', 'one', 'buy', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'really', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'doing', 'so', 'ended', 'up', 'not', 'believing', '8217', 'never', 'know', 'suspenseful', 'ending', 'only', 'thing', 'Cutter', 'Way', 'almost', 'nobody', 'received', 'accolades', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'John', 'Heard', 'masterful', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'top', 'game', 'Lisa', 'Eichhorn', 'wonderful', 'Arthur', 'Rosenberg', 'natural', 'Ann', 'Dusenberry', 'seductive', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'elements', 'Cutter', 'Way', 'terrific', 'neo', 'noir', 'downward', 'spiral', 'man', '8217', 'fantasy', 'quite', 'disquieting', 'real', 'same', 'time', 'So', 'am', 'surprised', 'Bone', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'Perhaps', 'might', 'explain', 'lot', 'why', 'theory', 'dominant', 'partner', 'submissive', 'partner', 'very', 'credible', 'charm', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'Cutter', 'Way', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'noir', 'genre']",N/A
276998,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,6301966368,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[7, 8]","""Cutter's Way,"" Ivan Passer's moody and eccentric 1981 drama, is the kind of film that requires repeated viewings. It's such a sad work, with unforgettable characters lost in a dreamy depression of white California sunshine. It's become a cult film, and perhaps its reputation precedes it.It was because of that very reputation that I first viewed the film as a youth and wondered what all the fuss was about. Now as an adult, I have seen it again and suddenly understand it's dark agony. ""Cutter's Way"" is not an easy film to like, limping along much like its title character, enraged and filled with the bitterness of unfortunate fate.John Heard's performance is the key. There was a time, around the late 1970s, when he was one of America's greatest actors. Heard made a trio of films, now largely forgotten, in which he perfectly symbolized the disaffected 20-something American suffering from a 1960's hangover. InBetween the Lines (1985)(1977),Head Over Heels (aka Chilly Scenes of Winter)(1979)  and ""Cutter's Way,"" he was adorned in frayed jeans, scruffy hair and the perennial slouch of the cynic, railing against society and wondering just how he failed to realize the moment America went to hell. As Alex Cutter in ""Cutter's Way,"" Heard gives a tour de force. A Vietnam veteran, hobbling around with one leg, one arm and an eye patch, Cutter is a perpetual drunk, slinging insults to anyone within earshot. He is enraged at a world that has forgotten him.His best friend is Richard Bone (Jeff Bridges), a part-time beach bum, gigolo and boat salesman floating through a life of forgotten youth. They lounge in semi-commune in a rundown house with Cutter's wife Maureen (Lisa Eichhorn), the trio lost in depression and bottles of vodka. There was a time when life had meaning for these three, but that was many years ago.Bone is driving home from a dalliance with an older married woman when his car breaks down in an alley. He witnesses a man dumping something into a trashcan, who then drives past him recklessly. Bone finds the police at his door the next morning. What was in the trashcan was a dead teenage hooker, and he's a suspect. At a parade the next day, he sees a man on a white horse and realizes this was the person he witnessed in the alley. There's one problem - he's the wealthiest and most powerful man in Santa Barbara.Thus begins an unlikely mystery as Cutter wishes to fight for justice and see the man pay for his heinous crime. Bone, of course, could care less. For Cutter, it's an opportunity to convince his friend their miserable lives have purpose. Society, America, injustice - everything they once fought and rebelled against during the 1960s - has suddenly landed on their doorstep in the form of ""The Man.""One of the many beauties of ""Cutter's Way"" is that you're never entirely sure if ""The Man"" is guilty or Cutter has just latched on to a fantasy to redeem a pathetic life. He alienates all around him and this specific project, blackmailing the suspect in an effort to prove he's guilty, could get them all killed. In the difficult and at times passive role of Bone, Jeff Bridges gives another in a long line of terrific performances. Forced to participate in Cutter's wild plan, he must come to terms with not only his love for Cutter, but his own loss of self worth. During their youth, hinted at throughout the film, there was the promise of making a difference while battling the Vietnam War, society and even Nixon. Such clear-cut enemies have long since faded. Much like the boats he attempts to sell, Bone is now adrift and average. Cutter's quest is an attempt to make a final stand against what he perceives to be corruption.The final scene amazingly has Cutter riding on a white horse through ""The Man's"" property, past swimming pools, martini glasses and the socializing elite, symbolic of the 1960's rebellion against a corrupt America. In Cutter's mind, this wealth created the Vietnam War and sent many teenagers oversea to fight their battle, akin to throwing their lives into a trashcan. Cutter, carrying the deep scars of war, is taking on ""The Man,"" and Bone must decide whether or not to make a stand with him. When the film fades to black, Cutter and Bone have become one, bonding for life as friends, performing the final, haunting act of the 1960's generation.It's a tragic ending, mournful and heartbreaking, and yet filled with love. ""Cutter's Way"" was barely released due to its unconventional nature, awkward, irate and disillusioned. But it has the depth of tragic poetry. After my second viewing, many years down the road, I suddenly understood the anguish of these characters, and it left me longing.

276999,A31ELTOVZM5JHR,6301966368,C. Rothlind,"[0, 7]","I was prepared to discover a lost American masterpiece and found a mediocre mess of a film.Jeff Bridges is a natural on screen. But Eichhorn seems to talk into herself; trapped in soft-spoken self-consciousness/-contempt. John Heard tries for bigger-than-life. Rather too hard, and winds up ""acting."" Always painful to watch. His efforts might have been more convincing with a better director. One able to register performances so as to amplify them. But Passer is too concerned to capture the proceedings realistically to play around with abstraction or stylization. What we get feels at once too casual and over-wrought.I tried to fast-forward my way through the Heard scenes, pretty much eviscerating the film in the process. The desire to move a film forward artificially indicates something's not working. Cutter's Way is one film that was not ""made in the editing room."" It could have used some paring-down.The murder-mystery is not allowed to set the tone of the film, or give it direction. Almost as if the killing were not in itself significant, only as the heinous ultimate misdeed of a corrupt corporate type [""McCord'] who acts as a projection screen for all that is vile in the disenchanted eyes of late 70's, Post-Vietnam sleaze-bags. There is no nuance or ambivalence about this villain: he is all evil, looming monolithically and one-dimensionally out-of-sight until the end. The film is ideological as a result, and rather comfortable in its righteous vision of corruption. It doesn't challenge us morally, testing only our endurance.For a film that eschews suspense and any emphasis on action, preferring to emerge the viewer in the characters' personalities, the end feels like a betrayal of that focus rather than a resolution. Suddenly a deed becomes the decisive thing. The gunshot is meant to bring the drama to a close, but as an ending feels arbitrary and abrupt. The realization that the gun was actually loaded is the sort of plot point that operates at a thematic level we have been urged to transcend.Instead of being drawn into a mystery, we are held hostage by disaffected drug-users, unhinged losers and part-time whores, with whom we're supposed to identify. Vincent Canby noted that Cutter's Way is ""enchanted by the sound of its own dialogue, which is vivid without being informative or even amusing on any level."" That about sums it up for me. It's too much of an insider's job.The whole exercise has a distinctly amateur feel to it. Like that western Peter Fonda directed. It will appeal to those who shared in the malaise of the post-Vietnam era. All the Tiffany lamps and house plants--a personal peeve--brought back a stylistic era I've tried hard to forget. More damning was the carelessness about the lighting and framing.The DVD is a bit dark, which is apparently faithful to the original. But it is also a bit soft.

A good film almost disappeared from sight. Fortunately, the advent of video, and now its debut on DVD, has given this unusual film a second chance that it so richly deserves.Jeff Bridges proves once again that he is one of the best American actors working in film today. He portrays Bone as a man afraid of commitment, content to do little, but fall back on his pretty boy looks to bed any woman who crosses his path. As one character tells him, ""Sooner or later you're going to have to make a decision about something."" This could be the underlying thesis of the whole film: making decisions, taking a stand about something.John Heard's Alex Cutter is on the opposite end of the spectrum. He desperately wants to get involved in something, anything to stop living life in a bottle of alcohol. And so, he latches on to the murder mystery with the ferocious tenacity of a pitbull. Heard plays Cutter like a character straight out of a Tom Waits song. His performance, complete with raspy voice and cynical outlook on life, recalls many of Waits' down-on-their-luck losers that populate his songs.The actors vividly breathe life into their respective characters creating the impression that they exist beyond what we see on the screen, that in some way we already know them and that they'll continue to exist after the film ends.Director Ivan Passer also deserves credit for creating this world. From the haunting opening shot of a parade, caught in dreamy slow motion (thanks to Jordan Cronenweth's superb cinematography), filmed at first in black and white and then as the credits fade in and out it gradually becomes colour, Passer draws the audience into his absorbing drama. Cutter's Way contains strong visuals to contrast the ambiguous story. Nothing is spelled out for the audience, even right up to its conclusion. Do we support Cutter's obsessive conspiracy theories or Bone's refusal to get involved?Following in the grand tradition of short changing this movie, MGM has decided to include only the theatrical trailer on the DVD. What about a retrospective featurette? All the principals are still alive and I'm sure would love to talk about this movie. Or an audio commentary? Jeff Bridges contributed an excellent one on the Against All Odds DVD so he's hip to the format.

277001,A2UUWETDYA2EKV,6301966368,Douglas Doepke,"[17, 18]","Brilliant allegorical film about wealth, power, and commitment  in America. Judging from other reviews, the film does not appeal to everyone. That's understandable. The characters are almost uniformly dislikable, from the abusive Rich (John Heard), to the egotistical Alex (Jeff Bridges), to the self-pitying Mo (Lisa Eichorn), to the slimy George (Arthur Rosenburg)-- there is no one left to root for. At least not until later when the two crippled halves of Bridges and Heard finally unite, figuratively and literally, into one potent whole. Then we realize that it's toward this completion that the twists and turns of the movie have been moving all along. (I think this also explains why the Ann Dusenberry character drops out at a critical stage. She is no longer needed to get the two together.)Rarely has any film dared to create such an unsympathetic cast of personalities, especially Heard's Richard Cutter. If he has a single redeeming quality, I can't find it. His loud, grating voice annoys, piling on one sarcasm after another, oblivious to the hurt he causes. Like Mo he wallows in self-pity, and even shamelessly exploits his disability. Then too, his pursuit of the god-like J. J. Cord should appear noble, yet seems more the result of paranoid rage than a  desire for justice. In fact, Heard's explosion of anger on the Santa Monica pier is among the scariest, most convincing expressions of pent-up emotion that I've seen in many years of movie watching. Perhaps he can be charitably viewed as an avenging angel, in the manner of Lee Marvin in Point Blank. But that's a a stretch, since the Vietnam War has left him literally half-a-man, a berserk little top spinning around on alcohol and apoplexy, which, of course, is why he needs the able-bodied Alex to carry out his obsession.Yet Bridge's Alex Bone is an ultimate floater, getting by on boyish good-looks and charm. He has no concerns beyond himself, even seducing the vulnerable Mo, while husband Cutter is away. Apathy is his natural state. So trying to get him to act on the murder he's witnessed is like trying to push a big rock uphill. In fact, when he finally does blend with Cutter's rage and act, it's only because of Cord's arrogant 'sunglasses' gesture, and not because of a sudden steadfast commitment. In most films, it would be the handsome Bone riding the white charger and storming the heavens, having undergone a last minute conversion, and finally giving the audience someone to root for. Here, however, it's the wild spirit of Cutter who rides to the rescue, having at last gotten his legs back if only for a moment. Thus, contrary to expectations, the only concession to Bone is a compromised last minute one.There is, of course, a political subtext to all of this as one perceptive reviewer points out. Perhaps it's about how criminal wealth and power exist beyond the reach of ordinary folks, and how a commitment for change gets dispersed by escapism and a popular feeling of powerlessness, which can only be corrected by what appears a radical form of madness. But allegories aside, this is a bitter brew that does not go down easily. More than that, however, it remains a superb cult film whose provocative characters and perplexing imagery stay with you long after the screen has gone to black.",5,"Wealth, Power, and Commitment",1147651200,"05 15, 2006",2006,3294,"['Brilliant', 'allegorical', 'film', 'wealth', 'power', 'commitment', 'America', 'Judging', 'other', 'reviews', 'film', 'not', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'understandable', 'characters', 'are', 'almost', 'uniformly', 'dislikable', 'abusive', 'Rich', 'John', 'Heard', 'egotistical', 'Alex', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'self-pitying', 'Mo', 'Lisa', 'Eichorn', 'slimy', 'George', 'Arthur', 'Rosenburg', 'one', 'left', 'root', 'least', 'not', 'later', 'when', 'two', 'crippled', 'halves', 'Bridges', 'Heard', 'finally', 'unite', 'figuratively', 'literally', 'one', 'potent', 'whole', 'Then', 'realize', 'completion', 'twists', 'turns', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'moving', 'all', 'along', 'think', 'also', 'why', 'Ann', 'Dusenberry', 'character', 'out', 'critical', 'stage', 'no', 'longer', 'needed', 'get', 'two', 'together', 'Rarely', 'film', 'dared', 'create', 'such', 'unsympathetic', 'cast', 'personalities', 'especially', 'Heard', 'Richard', 'Cutter', 'single', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'loud', 'grating', 'voice', 'annoys', 'piling', 'one', 'sarcasm', 'oblivious', 'hurt', 'Mo', 'self-pity', 'even', 'shamelessly', 'disability', 'Then', 'too', 'pursuit', 'god-like', 'J.', 'J.', 'Cord', 'should', 'appear', 'noble', 'yet', 'more', 'result', 'paranoid', 'rage', 'desire', 'justice', 'fact', 'Heard', 'explosion', 'anger', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'pier', 'scariest', 'most', 'convincing', 'expressions', 'pent-up', 'emotion', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'years', 'movie', 'watching', 'Perhaps', 'can', 'be', 'charitably', 'viewed', 'avenging', 'angel', 'manner', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'Point', 'Blank', 'stretch', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'left', 'literally', 'half-a-man', 'berserk', 'little', 'top', 'spinning', 'around', 'alcohol', 'apoplexy', 'course', 'why', 'able-bodied', 'Alex', 'carry', 'out', 'obsession.Yet', 'Bridge', 'Alex', 'Bone', 'ultimate', 'floater', 'getting', 'boyish', 'good-looks', 'charm', 'concerns', 'even', 'seducing', 'vulnerable', 'Mo', 'husband', 'Cutter', 'away', 'Apathy', 'natural', 'state', 'So', 'trying', 'get', 'act', 'murder', 'witnessed', 'trying', 'push', 'big', 'rock', 'uphill', 'fact', 'when', 'finally', 'blend', 'Cutter', 'rage', 'act', 'only', 'Cord', 'arrogant', ""'sunglasses"", 'gesture', 'not', 'sudden', 'steadfast', 'commitment', 'most', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'handsome', 'Bone', 'riding', 'white', 'charger', 'storming', 'heavens', 'having', 'undergone', 'last', 'minute', 'conversion', 'finally', 'giving', 'audience', 'someone', 'root', 'Here', 'however', 'wild', 'spirit', 'Cutter', 'who', 'rescue', 'having', 'last', 'gotten', 'legs', 'back', 'only', 'moment', 'Thus', 'contrary', 'expectations', 'only', 'concession', 'Bone', 'compromised', 'last', 'minute', 'course', 'political', 'subtext', 'one', 'perceptive', 'reviewer', 'points', 'out', 'Perhaps', 'how', 'criminal', 'wealth', 'power', 'exist', 'reach', 'ordinary', 'folks', 'how', 'commitment', 'change', 'dispersed', 'escapism', 'popular', 'feeling', 'powerlessness', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'corrected', 'what', 'radical', 'form', 'madness', 'allegories', 'aside', 'bitter', 'brew', 'not', 'go', 'down', 'easily', 'More', 'however', 'superb', 'cult', 'film', 'provocative', 'characters', 'perplexing', 'imagery', 'stay', 'long', 'screen', 'gone', 'black']",N/A

Those who appreciate 'noir' will give this movie the highest ratings.  Personally I find a lot of 'noir' cinema to be something of a cop-out - movie endings that stop in mid-sentence - yes, there's a poetry and a power in that, although I'm more of a sucker for clever twists and surprise endings.  This is a decent movie and a good character study with some haunting images, and themes - taking a stand, making a commitment and heroism amidst futility - are some of the issues that emerge.  However, it's not an extremely high-paced ride.  It takes it's time and meanders quite a bit in the beginning, garners more interest mid-way through, and then ends quite suddenly in traditional noir style.

277004,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,6301966368,J. Michael Click,"[5, 21]","Initially released as &quot;Cutter and Bone&quot;, this movie was pulled from theatres and retitled after several critics panned it.  Inexplicably, it became a film festival favorite and developed a minor cult following upon its re-release.  My verdict?  Those early critical drubbings were well-deserved.  For despite a potentially dynamic plot setup and one successful performance, the movie is ultimately done in by a lackluster screenplay, some uneven acting, and substandard direction.It all begins promisingly enough, with a fascinating title sequence followed by the introduction of Jeff Bridges as a two-bit gigolo who becomes a suspect in a murder investigation.  So far, so good.  Then John Heard enters as an obnoxious, bigoted, profane Vietnam vet-cum-amateur detective who uses his physical disabilities to excuse his ethical and moral shortcomings, and S-s-s-s! The plot quickly deflates into a slow, muddled study of his unpleasant character, losing its promising elements of suspense and mystery, and leaving the actors with the impossible burden of maintaining audience interest.  Tellingly, Bridges, who can convey character nuances with a subtle flicker of his eyes or shift of his lips, is great in his role; but Heard, who relies mainly on a gruff laugh and a gravelly voice that wavers unsteadily between slurring and over-enunciation, is merely grating in his.  As Heard's wife, the usually fascinating Lisa Eichhorn is thwarted in her underwritten and choppily edited role, and Ann Dusenberry -- whose odd character simply disappears without explanation near the end -- recites some of her lines as if they embarrass her (as well they should).  None of the actors is assisted by Ivan Passer's lackadaisical direction, which lacks both energy and cohesion, and only the final abrupt cut that ends this mess shows any prowess on the part of the editor.

I remembered it took place in the post-Vietnam era and one of the characters was a hard-drinking, foul-mouthed, crippled Vietnam vet.  I had forgotten that the book had depressed me then.  But viewing this video brought it all back to me.  And I was depressed all over again.The film is set in Santa Barbara and stars Jeff Bridges, as a drifter with an eye for women.  John Heard plays his best friend, the Vietnam vet, and Lisa Eichhorn plays the vet's alcoholic wife.  John Heard's makeup is great as it really looks like he has only one leg, one arm and one eye. He's a sorrowful sight but he's quite unlikable as he's an angry, scheming character with a sense of high drama.  Some of his dialog is brilliant and opens a lot of cans of worms about what happened in Vietnam.When Jeff Bridges stumbles upon a murder by an ""upright citizen"", John Heard convinces his friend to blackmail the murderer with the help of the victim's sister, played by Ann Dusenberry.  What follows is a sometimes funny and rather poignant psychological thriller, with an underlying sense of tragedy. It's fast paced, well acted and deals with an interesting theme.  I should have loved it.  Right?Wrong!  I just didn't like it.  It wasn't because the film wasn't good.  I just didn't like the sense of anger and hopelessness throughout.

Directed by Ivan Passer and filmed just before Jeff Bridges' career took off -he would star in the iconic ""Tron"" a year later and become a heartthrob in ""Against All Odds"" two years after that- ""Cutter's Way"" doesn't make full use of his talents, but it's a nice role nevertheless. It might have been known best at the time it was released for United Artists' lack of confidence in the film, but it proved the studio wrong. This was around the time of the sale of United Artists to MGM after the ""Heaven's Gate"" fiasco, so the studio was not in its best form at predicting successes.Richard Bone (Jeff Bridges) lives an aimless life on his boat and has an eye for the ladies. Driving home one night, his car stalls in an alleyway. Another car pulls up behind, and someone gets out to dump something in a trash can. Perturbed that the other car nearly ran him over, Bone walks home in the rain. When trash collectors find the body of a murdered young woman in that trash can, Bone is taken in for questioning. He can't identify the man he saw in the other car. But the next day, he spots the man in a parade: a ruthless local tycoon, J.J. Cord (Stephen Elliott). Bone thinks he must be mistaken. But his best friend Alex Cutter (John Heard), a one-eyed, one-legged, one-armed, alcoholic Vietnam vet with a chip on his shoulder, wants to try to entrap Cord with a blackmail plot.That's the ""noir moment"", as Eddie Muller would say. The point at which seemingly normal people do abnormal things. For some reason, Alex thinks that blackmailing Cord is a good way to get him to incriminate himself, rather than just telling the police what they've learned. Even stranger, the dead woman's sister Valerie (Ann Dusenberry) agrees. Bone is not so sure, but he's in deeper than he realizes already. John Heard's performance is too 1970s ""methody"" for my taste. I find it over-the-top. Valerie disappears from the action without explanation. ""Cutter's Way"" is not a perfect film, but if you enjoy the pessimistic noir of the 1970s, before noir became a big studio staple again in the 1980s, you'll probably enjoy this.The DVD (MGM 2001): The print of the film is fine, but the volume is too low.

277007,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6301966368,Only-A-Child,"[13, 14]","The title ""Cutter's Way"" is a reference to the main character, Alexander Cutter, perhaps cinema's all-time best antihero. John Heard plays the difficult role of an angry Vietnam veteran who returned from what he now regards as a meaningless war minus an arm, an eye, and a leg. He hates the fat cats-feeling that they conned him and others into patriotically serving while they stayed home, and he resents his best friend Richard Bone (Jeff Bridges) who avoided the war and continues to avoid any involvement or commitment. Commitment is Alexander Cutter's one remaining virtue, when he sets his sights on taking down an arrogant oil tycoon who has gotten away with murdering a 17 year old cheerleader, he stubbornly refuses to give up this mission and insists on doing it his way..Heard should have gotten the Best Actor Oscar in 1981 (it went to Henry Fonda for ""On Golden Pond"") but ""Cutter's Way"" was not popular with critics and viewers so Heard was not even nominated for this role. It is an amazing performance as Heard must win audience sympathy for a character who is not only unpleasant, but terribly abusive to everyone, including his wife and his only two remaining friends. But he earns our admiration with his final act as a knight (on a white horse) who gallops into danger to avenge his wife's murder.With this Cutter is finally revealed as a romantic who is willing to back up his angry words and seemingly empty threats. His anger is over more than his futile wartime sacrifice. He feels frustration and confusion because while he has remained the same, the world has changed around him in ways antithetical to his beliefs (can you identify with that?). He recognizes that he has become irrelevant to this world but is not going out until he has made a last stand. His commitment ultimately gets Bone to take his first moral stand and finish what his friend started, doing it ""Cutter's Way"".Like ""Fat City"" (another of Jeff Bridges' early films) ""Cutter's Way"" is more appreciated now than at the time of its release. In part this is because both of these films have held up very well, if anything their political messages are even more relevant today. And make no mistake, thematically ""Cutter's Way"" is a political film-both anti-war and anti-power; very much in the tradition of ""Chinatown"" and the world of Raymond Chandler adaptations.This film is essentially a character study with an expressionistic ending. Most action/adventure fans will find it way too slow and cerebral for their tastes. The acting and the themes are its strength, the contrived story is a non-fatal flaw. The multi-dimensionality of Cutter, Bone, and Cutter's wife Mo (an extraordinary performance by Lisa Eichhorn) are carefully crafted and revealed by director Ivan Passer. Cutter's other remaining friend George (Arthur Rosenberg) is equally well crafted but more secondary to the story.A fifth character (the dead cheerleader's older sister played by Ann Dusenberry) appears to be a victim of the post-production process as she simply disappears without explanation about 20 minutes before the film's end. Normally the absence of a supporting character would go unnoticed but Dusenberry had done such a nice job developing this character (maximizing what little she was given to work with) that the absence is glaring. Contemporary audiences will see a lot of Dominique Swain in Dusenberry. They not only look enough alike to be sisters but they have the same confident flare to their acting style. Passer had to work hard to keep Dusenberry reined in but succeeded in getting a nice restrained performance from her, her high intensity peaks through just enough to convey that there is more to her character than meets the eye.Then again, what do I know?

It is one of the greatest movies you have never watched. It is one that will seem familiar because many directors have harvested it for original ideas. Cutters Way is a total early 80s mystery that flew completely under the radar. The main reason for that is because you have to do some of thinking yourself. The film stars a young Jeff Bridges as Bone. This is proof that Jeff Bridges had an eye for well written scripts throughout his entire career. He takes the substance and runs with it. Bone is a gigolo who turns out to be a suspect in a random murder case. Bone and his over the top, insane, lunatic friend named Cutter think they know who commuted the murder. Are their accusations based in reality? Possibly. Are they board and completely crazy? Definitely. Ultimately you can decide.Cutters Way is really about crazy people acting crazy. It succeeds so well because its focus is on the characters and not the plot. For the most part the story is about a murder but the characters are all about booze. The booze of course tends to be much more interesting. The characters are so serious, their insanity is so sincere, you almost believe it. All that and it gets much deeper. If you have yet to see Cutters Way no review can really explain it. If you are a movie fan you will enjoy this one.

277010,A27MOT4ZIUAKIW,6301966368,The Jaundiced Eye,"[3, 8]","I recall seeing this movie in a theater way back in 1981, when it was first released, and thinking (at the time) that it was very entertaining. In a fit of nostalgia, I recently rented the DVD and discovered that my initial, youthful impression was way off base. Like Shelly Winters and fish, this movie did not age well.I have always been a great fan of Jeff Bridges (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot was a classic) and would have sworn that he never appeared in a bad movie....until I (re)saw this one. Bridges plays a gigolo/boat salesman who never works or commits to anything, which becomes quite tiresome as the movie progresses. His life is a sham and he constantly seeks the easy way out. I can accept this, but would have preferred some growth, some improvement in his character as the movie progresses. None is forthcoming. Worst of all, he lacks the sly, roguish charm we always expect from old Jeff...he is simply a boring, loutish, manipulative loser.John Heard, appearing rather young and slim (compared to his current corpulence) is annoying, loud, and obnoxious as the title character, Cutter: a badly injured Viet Nam vet who uses his disabilities as an excuse whenever his foul, drunken mouth gets him in trouble (which is often). Shouting and cursing is simply not acting...if it were, we could all be stars, and in this case, while I believe we are meant to find Cutter to be a troubled but amusing character, he is simply a repugnant jerk. It has been suggested that Heard deserved an academy award for his performance, but was not even nominated (big surprise), perhaps for ""political"" reasons. I contend that he was not nominated because his grating, annoying performance never rose above the level of school yard tantrum. It was awful. I would gladly submit to root canal surgery rather than endure another minute of his ranting dialog and gross, obnoxious over-acting.The only good characterization is by Lisa Eichorn, as Heard/Cutter's long suffering, alcoholic (who could blame her?) wife, who seems strangely amused and tolerant of his boisterous, annoying behavior. Perhaps she knows a side of him that is simply not presented in the movie. She presents a vulnerable, touching performance....the only redeeming virtue in this otherwise unremarkable movie.The plot is extremely slow moving, centering around the brief and indistinct witnessing by Bridges' character of the disposal of a murder victim. The very next day (what a coincidence !!!), while attending a parade, he believes that he sees the murderer, who happens to be a rich and powerful man. Rather than go to the police with their hunch, Cutter hatches a hair-brained plot to blackmail the rich guy....if he pays, then he must be guilty. He also enlists the help of the murder victim's sister, who seems totally unemotional, considering that her sister was brutally murdered two days before, and acts like she is along on a field trip to the zoo....which is no real problem, since she simply disappears from the cast long before the conclusion.The characters spend what seems like hours arguing, shouting, shoving, and degrading each other while they try to hatch their flimsy plot. Several times, my finger was poised over the ""STOP"" button on my DVD control, itching to put an end to this increasingly annoying shout-fest. I stuck it out to the climax, which is so unlikely, so utterly preposterous that it leaves you shaking your head in disbelief. I, like many of the other reviewers, may have been blinded by nostalgia, but the harsh reality is that this is simply not a good movie. Do yourself a favor and skip this turkey....other than watching Lisa Eichorn, it really isn't worth the time or effort.",2,"I am sorry, but this movie did not age well....I hated it !!!",1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,3691,"['recall', 'seeing', 'movie', 'theater', 'way', 'back', '1981', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'thinking', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'fit', 'nostalgia', 'recently', 'rented', 'DVD', 'discovered', 'initial', 'youthful', 'impression', 'was', 'way', 'base', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'fish', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'age', 'well.I', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'fan', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Thunderbolt', 'Lightfoot', 'was', 'classic', 'would', 'have', 'sworn', 'never', 'appeared', 'bad', 'movie', '.until', 're', 'saw', 'one', 'Bridges', 'gigolo/boat', 'salesman', 'who', 'never', 'commits', 'anything', 'quite', 'tiresome', 'movie', 'life', 'sham', 'constantly', 'easy', 'way', 'can', 'accept', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'growth', 'improvement', 'character', 'movie', 'None', 'forthcoming', 'Worst', 'sly', 'roguish', 'charm', 'always', 'expect', 'old', 'Jeff', 'simply', 'boring', 'loutish', 'manipulative', 'loser.John', 'Heard', 'appearing', 'rather', 'young', 'slim', 'compared', 'current', 'corpulence', 'annoying', 'loud', 'obnoxious', 'title', 'character', 'Cutter', 'badly', 'injured', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'vet', 'who', 'disabilities', 'excuse', 'whenever', 'foul', 'drunken', 'mouth', 'trouble', 'often', 'Shouting', 'cursing', 'simply', 'not', 'acting', 'were', 'could', 'all', 'be', 'stars', 'case', 'believe', 'are', 'meant', 'find', 'Cutter', 'be', 'troubled', 'amusing', 'character', 'simply', 'repugnant', 'jerk', 'been', 'suggested', 'Heard', 'deserved', 'academy', 'award', 'performance', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'nominated', 'big', 'surprise', 'perhaps', 'political', 'reasons', 'contend', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'grating', 'annoying', 'performance', 'never', 'rose', 'level', 'school', 'yard', 'tantrum', 'was', 'awful', 'would', 'gladly', 'submit', 'root', 'canal', 'surgery', 'rather', 'endure', 'minute', 'ranting', 'dialog', 'gross', 'obnoxious', 'over-acting.The', 'only', 'good', 'characterization', 'Lisa', 'Eichorn', 'Heard/Cutter', 'long', 'suffering', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'could', 'blame', 'wife', 'who', 'strangely', 'amused', 'tolerant', 'boisterous', 'annoying', 'behavior', 'Perhaps', 'side', 'simply', 'not', 'presented', 'movie', 'vulnerable', 'touching', 'performance', 'only', 'redeeming', 'virtue', 'otherwise', 'unremarkable', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'extremely', 'slow', 'moving', 'centering', 'brief', 'indistinct', 'witnessing', 'Bridges', 'character', 'disposal', 'murder', 'victim', 'very', 'next', 'day', 'what', 'coincidence', 'attending', 'parade', 'murderer', 'who', 'be', 'rich', 'powerful', 'man', 'Rather', 'go', 'police', 'hunch', 'Cutter', 'hair-brained', 'plot', 'blackmail', 'rich', 'guy', 'then', 'must', 'be', 'guilty', 'also', 'help', 'murder', 'victim', 'sister', 'who', 'totally', 'unemotional', 'considering', 'sister', 'was', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'two', 'days', 'acts', 'along', 'field', 'trip', 'zoo', '.which', 'real', 'problem', 'simply', 'cast', 'long', 'conclusion.The', 'characters', 'spend', 'what', 'like', 'hours', 'arguing', 'shouting', 'shoving', 'degrading', 'other', 'try', 'hatch', 'flimsy', 'plot', 'Several', 'times', 'finger', 'was', 'poised', 'STOP', 'button', 'DVD', 'control', 'itching', 'put', 'end', 'increasingly', 'annoying', 'shout-fest', 'stuck', 'out', 'climax', 'so', 'unlikely', 'so', 'utterly', 'preposterous', 'shaking', 'head', 'disbelief', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'blinded', 'nostalgia', 'harsh', 'reality', 'simply', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'Do', 'favor', 'skip', 'turkey', '.other', 'watching', 'Lisa', 'Eichorn', 'really', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time', 'effort']",N/A
