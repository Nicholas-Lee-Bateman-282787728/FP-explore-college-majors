Any fan of old black and white grade B westerns will probably enjoy a couple of these movies, especially the ones in which Lash resorts to using his bullwhip rather than his gun to fight the bad guys.Lash Larue wasn't the best western film actor, or the best looking western hero. Some have commented he bears a resemblance to Humphrey Bogart. Maybe, but I think Lash wins out in the looks department if you're comparing the two! And many of his films are quite entertaining. His gimmick with the bullwhip in some of the films is what set him apart from other B western heroes.As B westerns, some of the films on this DVD set are poverty row productions, with cheap interior sets and obvious in-studio backdrops for closeups of outdoor chase scenes. A big problem I've noticed in several films is the loud, racy and annoying musical accompaniment, which sometimes doesn't even fit the action onscreen, or lack of it, and becomes a distraction.Echo Bridge/Platinum Disc usually finds the best available film sources for their DVDs (take a look at the fantastic quality, restored Hopalong Cassidy films on DVD from this same company).  A couple years ago I bought what turned out to be a ""bootleg"" DVD set of Lash Larue films, and the quality was a lot worse than on this official release. But don't expect pristine video quality on most of the films here either, it varies from film to film from some footage that is pretty ragged, to excellent. Overall it's generally pretty good.  I sat and watched the first 4 of the films in a row last night, each clocking in at about an hour's running time. And 12 films for $7.50 (or even $14.99 if you're paying full list price) is one of the best DVD bargains in a long time.",4,"Great buy, and decent video quality",1365811200,"04 13, 2013",2013,2143,"['Dead', 'Man', 'GoldMark', 'LashFrontier', 'RevengeOutlaw', 'CountrySon', 'Billy', 'KidSon', 'A', 'BadmanThe', 'Dalton', 'WomenKing', 'BullwhipThe', 'Thundering', 'TrailThe', 'Vanishing', 'OutpostThe', 'Black', 'LashThe', 'Frontier', 'Phantomamazon', 'release', 'date', 'May', '2013', 'availability', 'DVD', 'set', 'bought', 'yesterday', 'Kmart', 'only', '7.50.It', 'great', 'collection', '12', 'Lash', 'Larue', 'westerns', 'varying', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'value', 'fan', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'grade', 'B', 'westerns', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'couple', 'movies', 'especially', 'ones', 'Lash', 'resorts', 'using', 'bullwhip', 'rather', 'gun', 'fight', 'bad', 'guys.Lash', 'Larue', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'western', 'film', 'actor', 'best', 'looking', 'western', 'hero', 'have', 'commented', 'resemblance', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Maybe', 'think', 'Lash', 'out', 'looks', 'department', ""'re"", 'comparing', 'two', 'many', 'films', 'are', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'gimmick', 'bullwhip', 'films', 'what', 'set', 'apart', 'other', 'B', 'western', 'heroes.As', 'B', 'westerns', 'films', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'poverty', 'row', 'productions', 'cheap', 'interior', 'sets', 'obvious', 'in-studio', 'backdrops', 'closeups', 'outdoor', 'chase', 'scenes', 'big', 'problem', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'several', 'films', 'loud', 'racy', 'annoying', 'musical', 'accompaniment', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'even', 'fit', 'action', 'onscreen', 'lack', 'distraction.Echo', 'Bridge/Platinum', 'Disc', 'usually', 'best', 'available', 'film', 'sources', 'DVDs', 'take', 'look', 'fantastic', 'quality', 'restored', 'Hopalong', 'Cassidy', 'films', 'DVD', 'same', 'company', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'bought', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'bootleg', 'DVD', 'set', 'Lash', 'Larue', 'films', 'quality', 'was', 'lot', 'worse', 'official', 'release', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'pristine', 'video', 'quality', 'most', 'films', 'here', 'either', 'film', 'film', 'footage', 'pretty', 'ragged', 'excellent', 'Overall', 'generally', 'pretty', 'good', 'sat', 'watched', 'first', '4', 'films', 'row', 'last', 'night', 'clocking', 'hour', 'running', 'time', '12', 'films', '7.50', 'even', '14.99', ""'re"", 'paying', 'full', 'list', 'price', 'one', 'best', 'DVD', 'bargains', 'long', 'time']",Lash LaRue Collector's Set

I wonder how many people recognized the  reference.Alfred ""lash"" Larue was an enigma. He would not tell his age or where he was born. He looked a little like Bogart and talked out the side of his mouth like a B movie gangster, yet he became a B western cowboy star from 1947-52. He played the hero but dressed all in black, rode a black horse and carried a black whip which he used to subdue outlaws. He had trouble with the law and alcohol, but worked some with an evangelist who called himself John 3:16. Wouldn't you like to see his identification cards?Lash starred in 20 B westerns, the first 8 for PRC. PRC was a small studio known for its cheap production values. the remaining 12 were produced by Ron Ormond. Ormond's productions made PRC look like MGM. The collector's set here contains the 12 Ormond films. The first 6 were directed by Ray Taylor who directed the PRC films. He was an old hand at westerns, and OUTLAW COUNTRY is above average with a 70 minute running time, good cast, and decent production values. A small problem is a rough soundtrack for some of the films.The second 6 were all directed by Ormond. Actually cut and paste would be more accurate. He shot a few minutes of new footage supplemented by many minutes of footage from the first 6. that is  very confusing, if you see the first 6. KING OF THE BULLWHIP is probably the best, with Lash and the villain fighting with whips. One of the best things about all 20 of the films starring Lash is Al St. John as the sidekick, Fuzzy Q. Jones. He was a fine comic actor who started in silent films.The 12 films in the set were some of the last B westerns  produced. They are still entertaining to us who remember seeing them in the forties and fifties. And the price is reasonable.I first saw Lash in the early seventies when he came to Melbourne, FL As an evangelist. I went to a service. He stood, still dressed in black, quoting poetry, some scripture, and his philosophy of life. The person in charge said Lash would be at a local topless bar the next night to ask about the closing of that establishment. I had to see that. Lash came, looked at the audience and the dancers, talked to the manager for a bit and left. The bar stayed open. I was disappointed:Lash did not bring his whip. In my imagination, I Could see lash driving all of us sinners and miscreants out of the place snapping that whip behind us.Lash's name is still heard in popular culture.
