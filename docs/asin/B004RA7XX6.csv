1426297,A1ZAIEZHFLI9UN,B004RA7XX6,Benjamin Archambault,"[14, 19]","That's What I Am is a tricky movie to rate. My wife didn't like it much, but I did -- and for totally different reasons. Let's talk about different aspects that were good and bad.The Good:Story-----The story is quite good and, for many people, easily relatable. A boy who is on the verge of being one of the ""cool"" kids has a choice to make. He can do what is right and end up with the nerds (i.e. those who will succeed) or do what is wrong and be liked by the bad boys and, better yet, the bad girls.As with many of us, his destiny is written by how he toys around with the sides of good and evil in middle school.Homosexual Message------------------Tons of people will probably have lots to say about the homosexual message in the film. There's no overt gross stuff to show you in either homo- or heterosexual (I think there may be one kiss in the whole film and its heterosexual). But the film deals in part with homophobia as a tool to get across a message:  Our public actions determine how we ought to be respected in a public setting. We can find fault with anyone, and it tends to be those with glaring faults who seem to get caught up in listing everyone else's.If you are pro-homosexual, anti-homosexual or don't care, I think you'll find the message mostly unoffensive and even inspire conversation in your house (as it did ours).Ed Harris---------He sticks out like a sore thumb. He's such a brilliantly good actor and he gets you caught up in every scene. The directors and writers use him brilliantly to move you with the plot. And he commands such authority that it's easy to see him as the sage teacher he portrays.The Not-So-Good:Acting------Most of the actors in the film are children. And most of it is pretty rough. The lead actors are decent for the most part. But don't expect anything more than you'd find on mid-day Disney.The Conclusion(s)-----------------The movie ends a few too many times in a few too many places. The first time I thought the movie was ending was a full 30 minutes before it did. And then it skipped around a few endind points in the last 5 or 10 minutes. It's quite forgivable though, because they just keep tying off all of the loose ends. And the ending ending (as opposed to the non-ending endings) is quite enjoyable.Overall:Honestly, I'd never buy this film even though I liked it. It's probably a one-time-watch film. But I was glad that I did see it.",4,I liked it for what it was,1306886400,"06 1, 2011",2011,2405,"['What', 'Am', 'tricky', 'movie', 'rate', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', 'did', 'totally', 'different', 'reasons', 'Let', 'talk', 'different', 'aspects', 'were', 'good', 'bad.The', 'Good', 'Story', '-The', 'story', 'quite', 'good', 'many', 'people', 'easily', 'relatable', 'boy', 'who', 'verge', 'being', 'one', 'cool', 'kids', 'choice', 'make', 'can', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'end', 'up', 'nerds', 'i.e', 'who', 'will', 'succeed', 'do', 'what', 'wrong', 'be', 'liked', 'bad', 'boys', 'better', 'yet', 'bad', 'girls.As', 'many', 'destiny', 'written', 'how', 'sides', 'good', 'evil', 'middle', 'school.Homosexual', 'Message', 'Tons', 'people', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'lots', 'say', 'homosexual', 'message', 'film', 'overt', 'gross', 'stuff', 'show', 'homo-', 'heterosexual', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'kiss', 'whole', 'film', 'heterosexual', 'film', 'deals', 'part', 'homophobia', 'tool', 'get', 'message', 'public', 'actions', 'determine', 'how', 'ought', 'be', 'respected', 'public', 'setting', 'can', 'find', 'fault', 'anyone', 'be', 'glaring', 'faults', 'who', 'seem', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'listing', 'everyone', ""else's.If"", 'are', 'pro-homosexual', 'anti-homosexual', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'message', 'mostly', 'unoffensive', 'even', 'inspire', 'conversation', 'house', 'did', '.Ed', 'Harris', '-He', 'sticks', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'such', 'brilliantly', 'good', 'actor', 'caught', 'up', 'scene', 'directors', 'writers', 'use', 'brilliantly', 'move', 'plot', 'such', 'authority', 'easy', 'see', 'sage', 'teacher', 'Not-So-Good', 'Acting', 'Most', 'actors', 'film', 'are', 'children', 'most', 'pretty', 'rough', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'decent', 'most', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'more', ""'d"", 'find', 'mid-day', 'Disney.The', 'Conclusion', 's', '-The', 'movie', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'places', 'first', 'time', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'ending', 'was', 'full', '30', 'minutes', 'did', 'then', 'skipped', 'few', 'endind', 'points', 'last', '5', '10', 'minutes', 'quite', 'forgivable', 'just', 'keep', 'tying', 'loose', 'ends', 'ending', 'ending', 'opposed', 'non-ending', 'endings', 'quite', 'enjoyable.Overall', 'Honestly', ""'d"", 'never', 'buy', 'film', 'even', 'liked', 'probably', 'one-time-watch', 'film', 'was', 'glad', 'did', 'see']",That's What I Am

So, I tend to pay attention to the depiction of race relations. Sometimes I think white people are really trying to rewrite history or something and I ask myself, ""Are they telling it like they lived it or the way they wished it had been?""There's the obligatory black ""friend"" that keeps you from being a racist and don't we all admire that black people play the drums and have rhythm???The casting, the acting, the dynamics, the chemistry... is atrocious in this movie! It would take forever to explain how off it is.For example, the bullying scenes... Why would the biggest guy on campus be the victim??? You know, I understand Compassionate Nonviolent Resistance. I have been that person. Watching the movie you can tell what they are trying to do and say. They just didn't do a very good job.And maybe I've just never been so oblivious or innocent or just stupid... ""What's a homo???!"" You have to ask that question? And they went from ""Homo"" to Child Molester in 2 seconds flat!Who's life is this? You remember learning about gay people. You had a black friend. A girl taught you to kiss. You got picked on but fought back. Everybody wishes they had talent and ""Life is but a Dream?""I wonder at the motives behind this movie.

1426300,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B004RA7XX6,D.P.,"[16, 19]","Andrew Nichol narrates this story about his younger self (Chase Ellison) being a 12 year old student who was is pared with Stanley a.k.a. ""Big G"" (Alexander Walters) for a school project by his teacher Mr. Simon (Ed Harris) to do a short story on tolerance.  Stanley is the school's biggest outcast due to his size including one incident where he was sprayed with a water gun to make it look like he wet his pants & always hung out at a section of the school called ""Geek Corner"" with the other outcast of the school.  Despite Stanley always keep his self-respect, Andrew didn't understand why he let people pick on him while Stanley's best friend Norman (Daniel Yelsky) would always get mad at him for doing things he felt that would just get them picked on more.  Along with having to do the assignment with Stanley, Andrew is also dealing with his father who is constantly on his case for not being able to do anything correct by his standards while develops a crush on Mary Clear (Mia Rose Frampton) who had her best friend tell him that she likes him as well.  That didn't set well with Mary's last boyfriend in Ricky Brown (Jordan Reynolds) who's the school bully & keeps threatening Andrew to stay away from Mary.  While all of this is going on, Mr. Simon is the most popular teacher in the school & even won the California Teacher Of The Year as he's very loved by his students but after an incident involving a student named Jason (Camille Bourgeois) that caused him to get suspended, he started spreading a rumor about Mr. Simon being a homosexual causing Jason's father (played by WWE superstar Randy Orton) to bring allegations against him with Mr. Simon refusing to comment stating that his teaching should stand on it's own.This was definitely a different type of film that we've gotten from WWE in the past as they put their own superstars in the background (Randy Orton only appeared in for maybe 10 mins. total) & did a family drama that focused on real issues as bullying, tolerance, and acceptance.  Ed Harris was top notch like always while all the children performed really well so this is a movie that I would go out of your way to see.",4,A Family Movie That Delievers A Strong Message,1313712000,"08 19, 2011",2011,2158,"['Andrew', 'Nichol', 'story', 'younger', 'self', 'Chase', 'Ellison', 'being', '12', 'year', 'old', 'student', 'who', 'was', 'pared', 'Stanley', 'a.k.a', 'Big', 'G', 'Alexander', 'Walters', 'school', 'project', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Simon', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'do', 'short', 'story', 'tolerance', 'Stanley', 'school', 'biggest', 'outcast', 'due', 'size', 'including', 'one', 'incident', 'where', 'was', 'sprayed', 'water', 'gun', 'make', 'look', 'wet', 'pants', 'always', 'hung', 'out', 'section', 'school', 'called', 'Geek', 'Corner', 'other', 'outcast', 'school', 'Stanley', 'always', 'keep', 'self-respect', 'Andrew', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'let', 'people', 'pick', 'Stanley', 'best', 'friend', 'Norman', 'Daniel', 'Yelsky', 'would', 'always', 'get', 'mad', 'doing', 'things', 'felt', 'would', 'just', 'get', 'picked', 'more', 'having', 'do', 'assignment', 'Stanley', 'Andrew', 'also', 'dealing', 'father', 'who', 'constantly', 'case', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'anything', 'correct', 'standards', 'develops', 'crush', 'Mary', 'Clear', 'Mia', 'Rose', 'Frampton', 'who', 'had', 'best', 'friend', 'tell', 'as', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'set', 'well', 'Mary', 'last', 'boyfriend', 'Ricky', 'Brown', 'Jordan', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'school', 'bully', 'threatening', 'Andrew', 'stay', 'away', 'Mary', 'going', 'Mr.', 'Simon', 'most', 'popular', 'teacher', 'school', 'even', 'won', 'California', 'Teacher', 'Year', 'very', 'loved', 'students', 'incident', 'involving', 'student', 'named', 'Jason', 'Camille', 'Bourgeois', 'caused', 'get', 'suspended', 'started', 'spreading', 'rumor', 'Mr.', 'Simon', 'being', 'homosexual', 'causing', 'Jason', 'father', 'played', 'WWE', 'superstar', 'Randy', 'Orton', 'bring', 'allegations', 'Mr.', 'Simon', 'refusing', 'comment', 'stating', 'teaching', 'should', 'stand', 'own.This', 'was', 'definitely', 'different', 'type', 'film', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'WWE', 'past', 'put', 'own', 'superstars', 'background', 'Randy', 'Orton', 'only', 'appeared', 'maybe', '10', 'mins', 'total', 'did', 'family', 'drama', 'focused', 'real', 'issues', 'bullying', 'tolerance', 'acceptance', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'always', 'children', 'performed', 'really', 'well', 'so', 'movie', 'would', 'go', 'way', 'see']",That's What I Am
1426301,A2TF232OLX7T10,B004RA7XX6,"D. Wilcox ""Lost in Wisconsin""","[1, 2]","I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this film.  We wanted to find some movies that we could show to my cousin's 11 year old son who is coming to live with us (a gay couple) that might help him better understand how to be tolerant and accepting of others who are different.  ""That's What I Am"" definitely does a good job in communicating that, using a story-telling style that reminds me of the ABC After-school Specials but with far better acting, writing and production values.  The presentation of tolerance is nicely, though very simply (too simply) framed, but that makes it all the more understandable for an adolescent.Ed Harris is very good as Mr. Simon, the favorite English teacher.  Though the portrayal is a bit cartoonish at times, it fits with the overall style of the movie.  Chase Ellison is great as the student, Andy, that Mr. Simon nudges into befriending a school outcast.  Supporting roles are well-cast with the exception of pro wrestler Randy Orton, who plays the father of another student (a bully) who threatens to out Mr. Simon as a homosexual based solely on rumor.  Orton is neither an actor nor does he seem comfortable playing his role in this period piece set in the late 1960s.  The film was produced by WWE Studios, so presumably this was a vehicle built at least in part around him... and that's unfortunate.  He comes off as a pro wrestler who can't act playing a role that could have been done by any number of others so much better.Something that I notable about this film is that it serves as a reminder of, back in the 60s (as well as for years afterward) how easily a person's life could be ruined simply based on the rumor of the person being gay.  I totally appreciated that, but at the same time as we look to help an 11-year-old feel more comfortable living with two dads now, this film is not the place to start.  Only when he is able to understand the context of the period in time in which the story takes place will he benefit from this aspect of the film.Lastly, since was in grade school during the 1960s, I really enjoyed the look of the film.  The production design takes great care to be true to the era, from cars to clothes, to home decor, to the old reel lawn mower Andy pushes around.  It was fun to watch just for that.",5,A sweet film with a few important messages,1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,2286,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'purchased', 'film', 'wanted', 'find', 'movies', 'could', 'show', 'cousin', '11', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'who', 'coming', 'live', 'gay', 'couple', 'might', 'help', 'better', 'understand', 'how', 'be', 'tolerant', 'accepting', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'What', 'Am', 'definitely', 'good', 'job', 'communicating', 'using', 'story-telling', 'style', 'ABC', 'After-school', 'Specials', 'far', 'better', 'acting', 'writing', 'production', 'values', 'presentation', 'tolerance', 'nicely', 'very', 'simply', 'too', 'simply', 'framed', 'more', 'understandable', 'adolescent.Ed', 'Harris', 'very', 'good', 'Mr.', 'Simon', 'favorite', 'English', 'teacher', 'portrayal', 'bit', 'cartoonish', 'times', 'overall', 'style', 'movie', 'Chase', 'Ellison', 'great', 'student', 'Andy', 'Mr.', 'Simon', 'befriending', 'school', 'outcast', 'Supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'well-cast', 'exception', 'pro', 'wrestler', 'Randy', 'Orton', 'who', 'father', 'student', 'bully', 'who', 'Mr.', 'Simon', 'homosexual', 'based', 'solely', 'rumor', 'Orton', 'actor', 'seem', 'comfortable', 'playing', 'role', 'period', 'piece', 'set', 'late', '1960s', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'WWE', 'Studios', 'so', 'presumably', 'was', 'vehicle', 'built', 'least', 'part', 'unfortunate', 'off', 'pro', 'wrestler', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'playing', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'number', 'others', 'so', 'much', 'better.Something', 'notable', 'film', 'reminder', 'back', '60s', 'as', 'well', 'years', 'afterward', 'how', 'easily', 'person', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'ruined', 'simply', 'based', 'rumor', 'person', 'being', 'gay', 'totally', 'appreciated', 'same', 'time', 'look', 'help', '11-year-old', 'feel', 'more', 'comfortable', 'living', 'two', 'dads', 'now', 'film', 'not', 'place', 'start', 'Only', 'when', 'able', 'understand', 'context', 'period', 'time', 'story', 'place', 'will', 'benefit', 'aspect', 'film.Lastly', 'was', 'grade', 'school', '1960s', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'look', 'film', 'production', 'design', 'great', 'care', 'be', 'true', 'era', 'cars', 'clothes', 'home', 'decor', 'old', 'reel', 'lawn', 'mower', 'Andy', 'around', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'just']",That's What I Am
1426302,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B004RA7XX6,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[4, 8]","THAT'S WHAT I AM (Writ./Dir. Michael Pavone, 2011, 100 minutes) is yet another all-too-typical-coming-of-age story. In 1965 California, a young 8th grade boy learns about what it just might mean to become a man. Ho-hum, end of plot.What I enjoyed here was the adult acting talent that made me dream of what could have been: Ed Harris as the 8th grade teacher Mr. Simon; Amy Madigan as the school principal; the good old all-purpose Daniel Roebuck as our young protagonist's father; and the children were just as good with a cast led by Chase Ellison as our protagonist Andy Nichol. An incredibly handsome Alexander Walters, in grotesque makeup causing him to resemble a young Abe Lincoln, plays Andy's friend Stanley.The acting by the kids was grade-A; it was simply too predictable and frankly an annoyance. Andy's obsession with the school tramp, whom he eventually gets to date for a few weeks, was irritating to say the least. It brought back certain memories for me, in spite of the usual terrible anachronisms that mark an amateur director. Well, even great directors fall into this lazy trap, so it is beyond me why someone low on the ladder would even try a period coming-of-age film.The usually pointless lazy trap that is the coming-of-age genre being what it is, which ought to have a vital point or at least hilarious comedy, it needs some retooling if directors are going to keep at it. Probably the finest coming-of-age film I know is the gentle, hilarious family comedyThe Sasquatch Gang(see my review). If these films were more like THAT, I would be a deal happier. An example of what they should NEVER be isThe Hunger Games, with children killing each other (see my review).There was an interesting twist in the story involving a rumor that Mr. Simon was gay. Again, as with all amateurs and just plain bad directors, the thing simply resolved itself by Mr. Simon resigning from his teaching position. It angered me because I asked, This is what they hired Ed Harris for?! There must have been some message intended by the distraction, which makes up the mid third of the film, of the parents' hateful attitude toward gay people which I recall so well from the era.Again, go-nowhere padding to an already anemic project.Throw in the even worse error of the protagonist-as-adult narration and it just plain stinks at certain points. It does not help that the actor narrating is one of those idiots who speaks with an intonation as if every sentence were a question.Well, if you're new to the genre or you have 12-year-olds and you'd like them to have a relatively good start, I'd say get this film. I'd as soon recommend others, but at least this isn't absolutely awful.",3,The 3rd star for Ed Harris and the kids.

Ed Harris is an 8th grade English teacher. He pairs up students in his class for their final assignment. One pair consists of the narrator, a thoughtful, bright semi-outsider and a too tall, elephant eared major outsider. This pairing gives both boys a new and different view of life. This is a brief outline, but the sub stories all fall under this banner.As in all schools you have the ""in"" kids, the ""geeks"", the homely and nondescript. A representation of each group are brought into the outline, but much of it (too much of it) is cliche. Other than ""Big G"" the geek, there were no characters you haven't seen before any number of times. And many of the plot points beg for a Hollywood treatment. The producers here tried, valiantly, to avoid this and it didn't work. The high points weren't high enough and the quieter parts were just blah. And they screwed up other rudimentary aspects as well. This is set in the early 60s yet the the characters speak using phrases that have only come into vogue recently. And during a talent show, some kids perform in a rock band using instruments that didn't exist at the time.

I liked the way that the story was consistent with reality at that time. Like one piece front seats. The movie showed how some of the kids eventually went on to become writers, parents and convicted felon (of course your daily decisions factor a lot in your destiny.) I think the movie shows that everyone was made for a different destiny and purpose. I rented this movie and it was enough. It is not worth the full price that amazon is asking for it. I would consider a purchase at six dollars. No more. I don't think this movie is of course representative of everyone's childhood. Some kids have never been to school dances or the prom.
