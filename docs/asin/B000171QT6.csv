In part, because I was sitting in a bubble (a sterile room with filtered and purified air) with my partner of 4 1/2 years who was undergoing salvage chemotherapy for a high-grade level 5 non-Hodgkins lymphoma.  I was forced into watching this movie on a television and VCR I had taken to the hospital!This Spanish movie, which stars among others Antonio Banderas, is truly a tragic love story of the character played by Antonio Banderas' obsession for another man who he loves deeply.  The movie has bizarre twists in a love quadrangle that keeps the brow raised on many occasions, and at the end, where Antonio's love is holding him in his arms and sobbing that tear-jerking sob that comes from the soul, my partner called out to me and said ""I will always love you, okay?"" and had stopped breathing and passed away which is why this movie is truly embedded in me forever.An excellent drama, but be prepared with lots of tissue.",5,A Tragic Love Story and Foreign Film,1186876800,"08 12, 2007",2007,1023,"['Law', 'Desire', '[', 'La', 'Ley', 'Del', 'Deseo', ']', 'far', 'most', 'memorable', 'foreign', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'part', 'was', 'sitting', 'bubble', 'sterile', 'room', 'filtered', 'purified', 'air', 'partner', '4', '1/2', 'years', 'who', 'was', 'undergoing', 'salvage', 'chemotherapy', 'high-grade', 'level', '5', 'non-Hodgkins', 'lymphoma', 'was', 'forced', 'watching', 'movie', 'television', 'VCR', 'had', 'taken', 'hospital', 'Spanish', 'movie', 'others', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'truly', 'tragic', 'love', 'story', 'character', 'played', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'obsession', 'man', 'who', 'deeply', 'movie', 'bizarre', 'twists', 'love', 'quadrangle', 'brow', 'raised', 'many', 'occasions', 'end', 'where', 'Antonio', 'love', 'holding', 'arms', 'sobbing', 'tear-jerking', 'sob', 'soul', 'partner', 'called', 'out', 'said', 'will', 'always', 'love', 'had', 'stopped', 'breathing', 'passed', 'away', 'why', 'movie', 'truly', 'embedded', 'forever.An', 'excellent', 'drama', 'be', 'prepared', 'lots', 'tissue']",N/A

794590,A1FLCQRKBTADQQ,B000171QT6,"Roger W. Davenport ""neurologyroger""","[6, 7]","The Law of Desire was the first of Almodovar's films to be released in the U.S. although it is not his first film.  And what an introduction.  The film is sleek and sexy and captures Antonio Banderas in all his sexual beauty.  What one has to know about Almodovar is the sense of humor behind the vehicle which is the film.  To begin with, the GREAT Carmen Maura has an incredible history: she was a boy, taken away by her father as I recall, had a subsequent sex change to become a woman and is now in a lesbian relationship--so she has essentially come full circle!  That is the sly humor of Almodovar; his art also draws you into the pathology of Banderas, with his incredible beauty, until you are finally rooting for him to accomplish his criminal intent.  When Almodova wants to be flippant he is the master; when he wants to get a joke across, the delivery is first class; when he wants you to cry, he is incomparable--I defy anyone to sit through All About My Mother with dry eyes.  The future genius of Almodovar is up front in this film and his work to date has never disappointed.",5,celluloid eroticism,1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,1091,"['Law', 'Desire', 'was', 'first', 'Almodovar', 'films', 'be', 'released', 'U.S.', 'not', 'first', 'film', 'what', 'introduction', 'film', 'sleek', 'sexy', 'captures', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'sexual', 'beauty', 'What', 'one', 'know', 'Almodovar', 'sense', 'humor', 'vehicle', 'film', 'begin', 'GREAT', 'Carmen', 'Maura', 'incredible', 'history', 'was', 'boy', 'taken', 'away', 'father', 'recall', 'had', 'subsequent', 'sex', 'change', 'become', 'woman', 'now', 'lesbian', 'relationship', 'essentially', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'sly', 'humor', 'Almodovar', 'art', 'also', 'pathology', 'Banderas', 'incredible', 'beauty', 'are', 'finally', 'rooting', 'accomplish', 'criminal', 'intent', 'When', 'Almodova', 'be', 'flippant', 'master', 'when', 'get', 'joke', 'delivery', 'first', 'class', 'when', 'cry', 'incomparable', 'defy', 'anyone', 'sit', 'My', 'Mother', 'dry', 'eyes', 'future', 'genius', 'Almodovar', 'up', 'front', 'film', 'work', 'date', 'never', 'disappointed']",N/A
