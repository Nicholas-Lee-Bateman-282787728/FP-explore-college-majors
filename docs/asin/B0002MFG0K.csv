840083,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0002MFG0K,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[23, 29]","Well, I can honestly say that this is the first time that I experienced a film that had literally no meat or potatoes in it.  The entire film felt like it was just the salad with no main course.  The story line was fallible and laughable, the characters were one-dimensional, the realism was out the window, and the animation was done by four-year olds.  Does that cover it?  I have never been more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life.  I have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character, but from the looks of the other reviews I am not off base with my observation.To begin, the story moved too quickly.  For someone new to this character and situations, I needed more built into creating the reasons instead of finding the solution.  I have seen other Anime (if you could call this one an Anime) that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them.  There was nothing set aside for Lady Death.  In a few short scenes, we see her train with Cremator and instantly become this aggressive she-beast of Hell.  This was hard for me to swallow, considering moments before she was introduced as this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father.  Suddenly, she is immersed with hatred and can do battle with an existence that has been around for millions of years.  This was absurd.  The presentation of Lady Death was poor, to say the least.  I felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind.  For me, it just didn't work.  She was nothing more than eye-candy for prepubescent boys wanting to ogle the mass quantities of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest when training with Cremator.  Oh, I felt sick just watching her.  The same goes for the character of Cremator.  Who was this random person?  The explanation they gave wasn't enough, and instead I was left with more incoherent babbling than actual development.  It is a very sad day in Hell when we forgo characters to show more violence and action, especially in an animated feature.Next, there was Lucifer himself.  Let me just say that I think I could do battle with the King of Hell and survive.  He was weak, his voice was laughable, and he just didn't represent the image that I had in my mind.  It was as if Disney was in control and wanted to make him semi-PC.  He lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that Lucifer embodies.  He was not the ruler of Hell, but instead just a lackey that had a bigger place to live.  Speaking of living or dying, how can you die again in Hell?  That was a concept that definitely needed more explanation.  Most of the characters were worrying about dying, when they didn't even consider the option that they were already dead.  That is how they got to Hell.  I think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me.  I didn't quite capture the notion that your soul was still in a solid body in Hell, but that could just be me ... or maybe it was because there was NO DEVELOPMENT in this story.  There was nothing built, just preparing.The battle sequences were hysterically bad.  The animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early 90s.  There was nothing impressive about the way that this film was drawn.  Why are we, America, so behind on animation?  It is huge in Asia, and it is creeping in hardcore here because we keep making films like Lady Death that do not challenge or use any part of imagination.  We are cheap, and this film shows it.Overall, this film was bad.  The animation coupled with the horrendous voice work was cheap.  I had head somewhere that this film as in production for a long time, which is hard to understand because I think I could have made this film on my credit card.  The production was horrendous as well as the story.  Nothing was developed, leaving huge gaping plot holes that nearly everyone fell into.  The strength of the characters was missing, and nothing was explained.  I wasted my time with this one and would like to warn others so that when Death does come, you don't find yourself in my state and regretting the fact that you wasted 80 minutes on this piece of garbage.BLAH!Grade: * out of *****",1,Let Death be a Lady tonight......,1103155200,"12 16, 2004",2004,4203,"['Well', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'first', 'time', 'experienced', 'film', 'had', 'literally', 'no', 'meat', 'potatoes', 'entire', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'just', 'salad', 'main', 'course', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'fallible', 'laughable', 'characters', 'were', 'one-dimensional', 'realism', 'was', 'window', 'animation', 'was', 'done', 'four-year', 'olds', 'cover', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'embarrassed', 'concept', 'entire', 'life', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'comics', 'seen', 'other', 'programs', 'character', 'looks', 'other', 'reviews', 'am', 'not', 'base', 'observation.To', 'begin', 'story', 'moved', 'too', 'quickly', 'someone', 'new', 'character', 'situations', 'needed', 'more', 'built', 'creating', 'reasons', 'instead', 'finding', 'solution', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'Anime', 'could', 'call', 'one', 'Anime', 'do', 'great', 'things', 'characters', 'take', 'time', 'develop', 'was', 'nothing', 'set', 'aside', 'Lady', 'Death', 'few', 'short', 'scenes', 'see', 'train', 'Cremator', 'instantly', 'become', 'aggressive', 'she-beast', 'Hell', 'was', 'hard', 'swallow', 'considering', 'moments', 'was', 'introduced', 'weak', 'feeble', 'woman', 'controlled', 'father', 'Suddenly', 'immersed', 'hatred', 'can', 'do', 'battle', 'existence', 'been', 'millions', 'years', 'was', 'absurd', 'presentation', 'Lady', 'Death', 'was', 'poor', 'say', 'least', 'felt', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'animated', 'character', 'instead', 'desperate', 'woman', 'revenge', 'mind', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'eye-candy', 'prepubescent', 'boys', 'wanting', 'ogle', 'mass', 'quantities', 'skin', 'suddenly', 'grew', 'chest', 'when', 'training', 'Cremator', 'Oh', 'felt', 'sick', 'just', 'watching', 'same', 'character', 'Cremator', 'Who', 'was', 'random', 'person', 'explanation', 'gave', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'instead', 'was', 'left', 'more', 'incoherent', 'babbling', 'actual', 'development', 'very', 'sad', 'day', 'Hell', 'when', 'forgo', 'characters', 'show', 'more', 'violence', 'action', 'especially', 'animated', 'feature.Next', 'was', 'Lucifer', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'think', 'could', 'do', 'battle', 'King', 'Hell', 'survive', 'was', 'weak', 'voice', 'was', 'laughable', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'represent', 'image', 'had', 'mind', 'was', 'Disney', 'was', 'control', 'wanted', 'make', 'semi-PC', 'lacked', 'darkness', 'corrupt', 'nature', 'Lucifer', 'was', 'not', 'ruler', 'Hell', 'instead', 'just', 'lackey', 'had', 'bigger', 'place', 'live', 'Speaking', 'living', 'dying', 'how', 'can', 'die', 'again', 'Hell', 'was', 'concept', 'definitely', 'needed', 'more', 'explanation', 'Most', 'characters', 'were', 'worrying', 'dying', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'consider', 'option', 'were', 'already', 'dead', 'how', 'got', 'Hell', 'think', 'was', 'level', 'thinking', 'ruined', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'capture', 'notion', 'soul', 'was', 'still', 'solid', 'body', 'Hell', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'maybe', 'was', 'was', 'DEVELOPMENT', 'story', 'was', 'nothing', 'built', 'just', 'preparing.The', 'battle', 'sequences', 'were', 'hysterically', 'bad', 'animation', 'cartoon', 'felt', 'was', 'made', 'early', '90s', 'was', 'nothing', 'impressive', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'drawn', 'Why', 'are', 'America', 'so', 'animation', 'huge', 'Asia', 'creeping', 'hardcore', 'here', 'keep', 'making', 'films', 'Lady', 'Death', 'do', 'not', 'challenge', 'use', 'part', 'imagination', 'are', 'cheap', 'film', 'it.Overall', 'film', 'was', 'bad', 'animation', 'coupled', 'horrendous', 'voice', 'work', 'was', 'cheap', 'had', 'head', 'somewhere', 'film', 'production', 'long', 'time', 'hard', 'understand', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'credit', 'card', 'production', 'was', 'horrendous', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'Nothing', 'was', 'developed', 'leaving', 'huge', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'fell', 'strength', 'characters', 'was', 'missing', 'nothing', 'was', 'explained', 'wasted', 'time', 'one', 'would', 'like', 'warn', 'others', 'so', 'when', 'Death', 'come', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'state', 'regretting', 'fact', 'wasted', '80', 'minutes', 'piece', 'garbage.BLAH', 'Grade', '*', '*****']",Lady Death - The Motion Picture
840084,A33H8DC3ZG58T0,B0002MFG0K,"Amazon Customer ""gorgon-13""","[0, 1]","If you're a Lady death fan then this is a fairly straight animation of the Chaos comics character, there are a few variations to the storyline, which outlines the transformation of Hope the nave girl to Lady Death Queen of hell, but nothing drastic. The style of the characters is also not that far removed from the graphic comic originals, though Lady Death herself is perhaps too much of a goody two shoes to jel with fan expectations. But despite this keeping faith with the source material it's not particularly good, in the extras the production team blather on about the wonders that new technology have brought to the film animation scene, but unfortunately Lady Death itself is a very poor illustration of this technology. Ten years ago and we'd have thought it a competent if uninspiring anim&eacute;, but when you compare it with its contemporaries, Ghost in the Shell 2, Metropolis, Appleseed and Sky Blue which are all a qualitative quantum leap ahead of this and you'll see how low budget and disappointing it looks.Now I happen to think Lady Death is worthy of a sequel, but it needs to be much better than this. The world of animation moved on and somehow Sunmin studios missed it, producing something a decade out of date before it hit the screen. They make much of having done Batman the animated series and that appears to be about their level, when the chance came to step up to the plate and do a movie, they fluffed it.",3,Dated underachiever,1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,1440,"[""'re"", 'Lady', 'death', 'fan', 'then', 'fairly', 'straight', 'animation', 'Chaos', 'comics', 'character', 'are', 'few', 'variations', 'storyline', 'transformation', 'Hope', 'nave', 'girl', 'Lady', 'Death', 'Queen', 'hell', 'nothing', 'drastic', 'style', 'characters', 'also', 'not', 'far', 'removed', 'graphic', 'comic', 'originals', 'Lady', 'Death', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'goody', 'two', 'shoes', 'jel', 'fan', 'expectations', 'keeping', 'faith', 'source', 'material', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'extras', 'production', 'team', 'blather', 'wonders', 'new', 'technology', 'have', 'brought', 'film', 'animation', 'scene', 'unfortunately', 'Lady', 'Death', 'very', 'poor', 'illustration', 'technology', 'Ten', 'years', 'ago', ""'d"", 'have', 'thought', 'competent', 'uninspiring', 'anim', 'eacute', 'when', 'compare', 'contemporaries', 'Ghost', 'Shell', '2', 'Metropolis', 'Appleseed', 'Sky', 'Blue', 'are', 'qualitative', 'quantum', 'leap', 'ahead', ""'ll"", 'see', 'how', 'low', 'budget', 'disappointing', 'happen', 'think', 'Lady', 'Death', 'worthy', 'sequel', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'world', 'animation', 'moved', 'somehow', 'Sunmin', 'studios', 'missed', 'producing', 'something', 'decade', 'date', 'hit', 'screen', 'make', 'much', 'having', 'done', 'Batman', 'animated', 'series', 'be', 'level', 'when', 'chance', 'came', 'step', 'up', 'plate', 'do', 'movie', 'fluffed']",Lady Death - The Motion Picture

I rented this out of sheer curiosity when I saw it on the website of my online dvd rental service. The premise of the film sounded intriguing. A young girl Hope is the daughter of a mercenary named Matthias who isn't what he appears to be. When villagers make accusations against Matthias for a fiery incident at his castle, Hope is punished for her father's crimes by the townsfolk and is burned at the stake. When Hope is reunited with her father in the underworld, she finds out his real identity as Lucifer. She quickly rejects her father's offer to rule the underworld and conquer the world together. Her rejection automatically sends her to Lucifer's former comrade Cremator. Under Cremator's tutelage, Hope slowly transforms into Lady Death both physically and emotionally. Lady Death is determined to bring down her father once and for all.I personally liked this movie. It isn't perfect. I have seen better animation from other anime films. The animation just seemed dated and didn't lack the vibrant colors or the amazing visuals that films like ""Ghost in the Shell"" or any of Hayao Miyazaki films possesses. The dialogue was terribly cheesy and unintentionally hilarious. I bet a chimpanzee could have written better dialogue than the humans that came up with this script.

I have all the comic books (including most variant covers) and I have most of the comics published by Chaos! Comics in general.  I didn't go as overboard as some people, where they own all the other products produced aside from comics, but I really liked a lot of the characters they put into comics.  I got into Lady Death when I was in junior high; naturally my motives weren't completely intellectually driven, as you should be able to tell from the cover of this movie.  As I got older I still appreciated the character and comics for what they were, but I certainly wasn't expecting anything profound at this point, nor was I when I picked up this movie.  I was pretty excited at first because I thought this story would be a great animated movie.  I was looking forward to seeing ""The Reckoning"" in film format... that's definitely not what us fans got.Unfortunately if you're a fan of this comic then this does not recount the tale like you read in the comics.  This feels way more haphazardly thrown together and really doesn't do the original writing justice.  Frankly, I don't exactly know what happened.  What I do know is that Chaos! Comics ended up going bankrupt during this time.  They actually filed for a chapter that requires you to sell off all assets, not the one where you get government protection to keep your business going, no, everything had to go.  However, Brian Pulido did manage to hold onto his rights of the Lady Death character and she now appears with him under Avatar Press.  During this fiasco this motion picture was being made, and I suspect that because everything else was tied up in legal issues he couldn't use the original story line from ""The Reckoning"".  Maybe he no longer held that copyright.  I think Pulido wanted to give his fans a film somewhat in the spirit of Lady Death at least, but his original story line was so much better than what we got here.  I know the man is a film major and really into film in general, but I really think this could have been done a little bit better.  Personally rather than recounting the origins of Lady Death I think maybe he should have written a whole different tale considering everything else was tied up, but maybe he couldn't?  I really don't know.In the end we have a film that is very loosely based on the original ""The Reckoning"" story line, but with a way more disjointed feel.  Like Lady Death ends up in Hell for totally different reasons, also her father is a vastly different person as well.  Cremator's role isn't explained very well at all, but they probably weren't allowed to use his original concept.  Not to mention whoever did the voice acting for Cremator was not a good fit at all, in my opinion.  However, I thought Lady Death's voice actor was suitable, so for that I was glad.  Even Purgatori's character was all wrong in this and she's my favorite Pulido character!  I don't know what more to say about this because I don't want to give too much away, because it doesn't make a lot of sense anyway and people will just get confused.  But for example, Lady Death ends up fighting all these demon lords that aren't even in the comics, never mind the fact they have nothing to do with her rise to power in Hell story line, but yet they're worked in?  Lady Death's realization of her powers in this is so sudden and haphazard, that it doesn't show that she was in Hell for a while before she really started figuring out how things work there in the original concept.Overall the animation is on par with cartoons you'd watch in the early 1990's.  I know this will seem quite poor for a 2004 release, but you have to remember the creators and artists are into nostalgia.  It's really no different than the art we saw in the original comic book series back in 1994.  I can see why people would complain about the animation in light of today's work if they never read this comic from 1994.  The most impressive thing about this movie was the soundtrack, which I thought was excellently powerful.  However, I really can't see many people buying into this film, fans of Lady Death and anyone else for that matter.  I can see what Pulido was trying to do, but I really don't think it worked overall.  I mean, I don't remember ""real"" Death showing up at all in ""The Reckoning"" and then her stealing his powers?  Basically she realized desire is power and then made the eternal graveyard in the comics.  That didn't really happen at all here... ah well, if it comes to take it or leave it, I'm leaving it.",2,Not the Lady Death I remember...,1215475200,"07 8, 2008",2008,4550,"[""'m"", 'pretty', 'big', 'Lady', 'Death', 'fan', 'suppose', 'have', 'comic', 'books', 'including', 'most', 'variant', 'covers', 'have', 'most', 'comics', 'published', 'Chaos', 'Comics', 'general', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'overboard', 'people', 'where', 'own', 'other', 'products', 'produced', 'aside', 'comics', 'really', 'liked', 'lot', 'characters', 'put', 'comics', 'got', 'Lady', 'Death', 'when', 'was', 'junior', 'high', 'naturally', 'motives', 'were', ""n't"", 'completely', 'intellectually', 'driven', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'cover', 'movie', 'got', 'older', 'still', 'appreciated', 'character', 'comics', 'what', 'were', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'anything', 'profound', 'point', 'was', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'excited', 'first', 'thought', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'animated', 'movie', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Reckoning', 'film', 'format', 'definitely', 'not', 'what', 'fans', 'got.Unfortunately', ""'re"", 'fan', 'comic', 'then', 'not', 'recount', 'tale', 'read', 'comics', 'feels', 'way', 'more', 'haphazardly', 'thrown', 'together', 'really', ""n't"", 'do', 'original', 'writing', 'justice', 'Frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'What', 'do', 'know', 'Chaos', 'Comics', 'ended', 'up', 'going', 'time', 'actually', 'filed', 'chapter', 'sell', 'off', 'assets', 'not', 'one', 'where', 'get', 'government', 'protection', 'keep', 'business', 'going', 'everything', 'had', 'go', 'However', 'Brian', 'Pulido', 'did', 'manage', 'hold', 'rights', 'Lady', 'Death', 'character', 'now', 'Avatar', 'Press', 'fiasco', 'motion', 'picture', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'suspect', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'tied', 'up', 'legal', 'issues', 'could', ""n't"", 'use', 'original', 'story', 'line', 'Reckoning', 'Maybe', 'no', 'longer', 'held', 'copyright', 'think', 'Pulido', 'wanted', 'give', 'fans', 'film', 'somewhat', 'spirit', 'Lady', 'Death', 'least', 'original', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'what', 'got', 'here', 'know', 'man', 'film', 'major', 'really', 'film', 'general', 'really', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'Personally', 'rather', 'recounting', 'origins', 'Lady', 'Death', 'think', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'written', 'whole', 'different', 'tale', 'considering', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'tied', 'up', 'maybe', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.In', 'end', 'have', 'film', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'original', 'Reckoning', 'story', 'line', 'way', 'more', 'disjointed', 'feel', 'Lady', 'Death', 'up', 'Hell', 'totally', 'different', 'reasons', 'also', 'father', 'vastly', 'different', 'person', 'as', 'well', 'Cremator', 'role', ""n't"", 'explained', 'very', 'well', 'probably', 'were', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'use', 'original', 'concept', 'Not', 'mention', 'did', 'voice', 'acting', 'Cremator', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'fit', 'opinion', 'However', 'thought', 'Lady', 'Death', 'voice', 'actor', 'was', 'suitable', 'so', 'was', 'glad', 'Even', 'Purgatori', 'character', 'was', 'wrong', 'favorite', 'Pulido', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'more', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'anyway', 'people', 'will', 'just', 'get', 'confused', 'example', 'Lady', 'Death', 'up', 'fighting', 'demon', 'lords', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'comics', 'never', 'mind', 'fact', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'rise', 'power', 'Hell', 'story', 'line', 'yet', ""'re"", 'worked', 'Lady', 'Death', 'realization', 'powers', 'so', 'sudden', 'haphazard', ""n't"", 'show', 'was', 'Hell', 'while', 'really', 'started', 'figuring', 'out', 'how', 'things', 'work', 'there', 'original', 'concept.Overall', 'animation', 'par', 'cartoons', ""'d"", 'watch', 'early', '1990', 'know', 'will', 'seem', 'quite', 'poor', '2004', 'release', 'have', 'remember', 'creators', 'artists', 'are', 'nostalgia', 'really', 'different', 'art', 'saw', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'back', '1994', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'would', 'complain', 'animation', 'light', 'today', 'work', 'never', 'read', 'comic', '1994', 'most', 'impressive', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'soundtrack', 'thought', 'was', 'excellently', 'powerful', 'However', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'many', 'people', 'buying', 'film', 'fans', 'Lady', 'Death', 'anyone', 'else', 'matter', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'Pulido', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'worked', 'overall', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'real', 'Death', 'showing', 'up', 'Reckoning', 'then', 'stealing', 'powers', 'Basically', 'realized', 'desire', 'power', 'then', 'made', 'eternal', 'graveyard', 'comics', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'happen', 'here', 'ah', 'well', 'take', 'leave', ""'m"", 'leaving']",Lady Death - The Motion Picture

The premise seems to be as follows:  what ifSpawnhad boobs?  Okay that's oversimplifying, but the parallels are several and Lady Death debuted but a year after Todd McFarlane's demonic anti-hero took the comic world by storm.  Her foray into animation isn't awful by any means, but it does look shockingly like a more violent and sexual version of something that would have aired on Saturday mornings when I was a kid.  That is not a compliment.  But first let's set up the story.Hope is a sweet young girl in love with a lame dweeb named Niccolo.  Her daddy is a crusader for the Church who claims to be taking villagers for God's army.  That is, until it turns out he's The Devil himself stealing souls in the name of God because he's a jerk like that.  Daddy escapes, leaving Hope to bear the horrific brunt of the villager's wrath and offering her a chant that will grant her eternal life as a parting gift.  As the pyre's flames burn the flesh from her body, she screams the words out in agony and is taken to Hell by flying demons who pluck her from her demise.  Once she gets home, she finds Satan holding no only the soul of her lover, but that of her long-departed mother hostage and demanding her obedience.  She spits in his face and is banished into the depths of The Abyss where she meets Lucifer's ex-blacksmith who has designs to overthrow big red, who apparently spends most of his time on a throne watching his fork-tongued concubines feel each other up.  Not a bad life, I suppose.  Anyways, turns out being the daughter of the Prince of Lies brings along with it some pretty killer telekinetic powers which the newly anointed Lady Death (having abandoned Hope) learns she can channel through objects such as swords.  She begins gathering an army of disloyal demons to overthrow her father and there the fun begins.  Pretty cool, yeah?The first thing I noticed about ""Lady Death"" was the rather dated look to the animation even with the anime-influenced art style.  This film was made five years ago.  Come on now!  I have no problems with old school animation for the most part.  Heck,Vampire Hunter Dis among my favorite films of all time.  But for an adult feature film that came out just a few years ago to look like an early-90's kid's show, I've got to take a point away right off the bat.  I haven't read the comics, but I've seen many images of the character and the illustrations I've seen are striking, ethereal, and less in the tone of 80's adult animation cheesefestHeavy Metalthe this.  The voice acting is average which I find shocking considering ADV Films once had an amazing stable of voice actors that infused their early anime DVD releases with dubs that were often superior to the original Japanese language tracks.All superficiality aside this is still not an outstanding production by any stretch, but it's certainly not a total loss.  I mean, did you not read the plot summary?  Naturally, there comes with the infernal setting a fair amount of dark and demonic imagery. Lots of maggot-ridden corpses and beasties, and did I not mention fork-tongued lesbian concubines?  There's also some decent violence, mostly beheadings and the like, and of course plenty of fanservice from The Lady herself, but I've seen it all done better before.  But what can I say?  I've got a thing for animated anti-heroines crusading through Hell on a mission of bloodshed.  It's not the best comic book adaptation out there, but I do think it's really cool that a company like ADV is trying to branch out and bring animation fans something really cool that isn't just a Japanese import so kudos on that.  Unfortunately, animation costs a lot of money and this one was very obviously made on a small budget.  Better art and animation could have made this really killer.  But still ""Lady Death"" is worth a look if this is your kind of thing and is worth supporting because American animation for grown-ups can be hard to find.",3,"""Abandon Hope, ye who enter here.""",1251849600,"09 2, 2009",2009,4226,"['Lady', 'Death', 'began', 'life', 'acomic', 'bookvillainess/anti-heroine', 'mid-90', 'eventually', 'found', 'way', 'small', 'screen', 'feature-length', 'animated', 'film', 'brought', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'ADV', 'Films', 'who', 'were', 'primary', 'driving', 'force', 'anime', 'invasion', 'North', 'America', 'premise', 'be', 'what', 'ifSpawnhad', 'boobs', 'Okay', 'oversimplifying', 'parallels', 'are', 'several', 'Lady', 'Death', 'debuted', 'year', 'Todd', 'McFarlane', 'demonic', 'anti-hero', 'took', 'comic', 'world', 'storm', 'foray', 'animation', ""n't"", 'awful', 'means', 'look', 'shockingly', 'more', 'violent', 'sexual', 'version', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'aired', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'not', 'compliment', 'first', 'let', 'set', 'up', 'story.Hope', 'sweet', 'young', 'girl', 'love', 'lame', 'dweeb', 'named', 'Niccolo', 'daddy', 'crusader', 'Church', 'who', 'be', 'taking', 'villagers', 'God', 'army', 'out', 'Devil', 'stealing', 'souls', 'name', 'God', 'jerk', 'Daddy', 'leaving', 'Hope', 'bear', 'horrific', 'brunt', 'villager', 'wrath', 'offering', 'chant', 'will', 'grant', 'eternal', 'life', 'parting', 'gift', 'pyre', 'flames', 'burn', 'flesh', 'body', 'screams', 'words', 'out', 'agony', 'taken', 'Hell', 'flying', 'demons', 'who', 'pluck', 'demise', 'home', 'Satan', 'holding', 'no', 'only', 'soul', 'lover', 'long-departed', 'mother', 'hostage', 'demanding', 'obedience', 'face', 'banished', 'depths', 'Abyss', 'where', 'Lucifer', 'ex-blacksmith', 'who', 'designs', 'overthrow', 'big', 'red', 'who', 'apparently', 'most', 'time', 'throne', 'watching', 'fork-tongued', 'concubines', 'feel', 'other', 'up', 'Not', 'bad', 'life', 'suppose', 'Anyways', 'out', 'being', 'daughter', 'Prince', 'Lies', 'pretty', 'killer', 'telekinetic', 'powers', 'newly', 'anointed', 'Lady', 'Death', 'having', 'abandoned', 'Hope', 'can', 'channel', 'objects', 'such', 'swords', 'gathering', 'army', 'disloyal', 'demons', 'overthrow', 'father', 'fun', 'Pretty', 'cool', 'yeah', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'Lady', 'Death', 'was', 'rather', 'dated', 'look', 'animation', 'even', 'anime-influenced', 'art', 'style', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'Come', 'now', 'have', 'problems', 'old', 'school', 'animation', 'most', 'part', 'Heck', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'Dis', 'favorite', 'films', 'time', 'adult', 'feature', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'look', 'early-90', 'kid', 'show', ""'ve"", 'got', 'take', 'point', 'away', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'comics', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'images', 'character', 'illustrations', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'are', 'striking', 'ethereal', 'less', 'tone', '80', 'adult', 'animation', 'cheesefestHeavy', 'Metalthe', 'voice', 'acting', 'average', 'find', 'shocking', 'considering', 'ADV', 'Films', 'once', 'had', 'amazing', 'stable', 'voice', 'actors', 'infused', 'early', 'anime', 'DVD', 'dubs', 'were', 'often', 'superior', 'original', 'Japanese', 'language', 'tracks.All', 'superficiality', 'aside', 'still', 'not', 'outstanding', 'production', 'stretch', 'certainly', 'not', 'total', 'loss', 'mean', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'plot', 'summary', 'Naturally', 'infernal', 'setting', 'fair', 'amount', 'dark', 'demonic', 'imagery', 'Lots', 'maggot-ridden', 'corpses', 'beasties', 'did', 'not', 'mention', 'fork-tongued', 'lesbian', 'concubines', 'also', 'decent', 'violence', 'mostly', 'beheadings', 'like', 'course', 'plenty', 'fanservice', 'Lady', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'better', 'what', 'can', 'say', ""'ve"", 'got', 'thing', 'animated', 'anti-heroines', 'crusading', 'Hell', 'mission', 'bloodshed', 'not', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation', 'there', 'do', 'think', 'really', 'cool', 'company', 'ADV', 'trying', 'branch', 'out', 'bring', 'animation', 'fans', 'something', 'really', 'cool', ""n't"", 'just', 'Japanese', 'import', 'so', 'kudos', 'Unfortunately', 'animation', 'lot', 'money', 'one', 'was', 'very', 'obviously', 'made', 'small', 'budget', 'Better', 'art', 'animation', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'really', 'killer', 'still', 'Lady', 'Death', 'look', 'kind', 'thing', 'worth', 'supporting', 'American', 'animation', 'grown-ups', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'find']",Lady Death - The Motion Picture
840107,A2GCL8PHJU751Q,B0002MFG0K,TwisT,"[0, 1]","Does she look like lady death? Hell yeah...Does this feel like the comics? NO.The animation could be better, there is no doubt about that. I have to agree with the other reviewers as well that the movie felt like it just ran too fast. The explanation of why she wants to kill Lucifer? Absolutely understandable...How she became Lady Death? Also understandable, but more time should have been spent on her training and understanding her powers. Instead they showed a midling length training session where we are supposed to assume that she spent ""years"" training (this is accomplished by wardrobe changes in the ""extended"" fight scene).Addtionally we are supposed to simply understand why souls in Hell are afraid of dying. There is only one explanation that makes any sense at all in this regard; you are already dead, you exist only as a soul in Hell. Soo what's left if the soul is destroyed? Nothing. Since I have read a lot of religious and occult texts this wasn't too much of a stretch for me but since most people don't read such things this really should have been explained in the movie but it wasn't.Normally I don't do or like spoilers but there is one thing in this movie that REALLY bothers me; mainly because it throws my explanation of soul destruction under a bus. In order to save his soul Lady Death must kill Nicolo so that his soul can be released and go to Heaven. My problem is simple; how the Hell is Nicolo ALIVE in Hell? Living creatures cannot exist in HELL!My final complaint is the ending: It does end but it also has an open ending?! C'mon! They aren't going to make another one, they never intended to make another one; so why give it an open ending? That's just mean!Call me crazy, but regardless of my complaints I still found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable show.",4,Lady Death?
