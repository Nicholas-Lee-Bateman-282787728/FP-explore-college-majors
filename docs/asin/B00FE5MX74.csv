The Temperance in the books does not think she is the smartest thing to hit a lab or anywhere, for that matter. While the story lines may be good, Brennan's ego gets in the way. If she had even a hint of humility, the stories would be so much better. As it is, three stars are the most I can give it. Besides all the other questions I would put to Ms. Reichs as to why she allows her character to be like this, the biggest question I have is, 'What does Seely Booth see in her that he can overlook her uppity attitude. Brennan needs an attitude adjustment...and quick. It's just a surprise that those she works with put up with her. In the real world, someone would have pulled her aside by now and told her what's what.

1671145,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B00FE5MX74,D. S. Thurlow,"[67, 68]","""Bones"" returns for a welcome ninth season with its core cast, clever plots, and sense of humor intact. Forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan and her crack team of specialists at the Jeffersonian Institute continue to work with their FBI liaison, Special Agent Seeley Booth, on new and challenging criminal cases. First, however, the team will have to resolve their long-running, lethal battle with cyber-genius serial killer Christopher Pelant, who has stayed one step ahead of them while inflicting pain on each member of the cast.When we last saw the team, they had barely survived their most recent encounter with Pelant. In a final twist of spite, Pelant blackmailed Booth into withdrawing his marriage proposal to Bones, while forbidding him to reveal the reason why. Booth's promise puts a strain on his relationship with Bones. He will reach out to old Army buddies, including a CIA agent and a former priest turned bartender, for advice. Pelant has his own plan for separating Bones from Bones from Booth, permanently. The entire team will have to be on its mettle to head off Pelant's insidious plot.The ninth season continues to feature crime of the week murders for Bones, Booth, and the Jeffersonian lab rats to solve. One episode will have Booth and Bones resurrecting their undercover ""Tony"" and ""Roxie"" identities for a hilarious marriage retreat in which they talk all too frankly about their relationship. Psychologist Dr. Sweets will take a leave of absence to work in an outreach center, only to find himself drawn back into a gut-wrenching case involving a gang feud. As in past seasons, other members of the team, including Lab boss Dr. Saroyan, Dr. Hodgins, Angela, and the interns will have their moments in the spotlight.The producers of ""Bones"" have promised a wedding for Booth and Bones this season, which should be reason enough for longtime fans to tune in. And that doesn't do for fans, a scary-thrilling season finale should.  ""Bones: The Complete Ninth Season"" is highly recommended to its fans.",5,Time for a wedding?...,1381449600,"10 11, 2013",2013,2045,"['Bones', 'returns', 'welcome', 'ninth', 'season', 'core', 'cast', 'clever', 'plots', 'sense', 'humor', 'intact', 'Forensic', 'anthropologist', 'Dr.', 'Temperance', 'Bones', 'Brennan', 'crack', 'team', 'specialists', 'Jeffersonian', 'Institute', 'continue', 'work', 'FBI', 'liaison', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Seeley', 'Booth', 'new', 'challenging', 'criminal', 'cases', 'First', 'however', 'team', 'will', 'have', 'resolve', 'long-running', 'lethal', 'battle', 'cyber-genius', 'serial', 'killer', 'Christopher', 'Pelant', 'who', 'stayed', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'inflicting', 'pain', 'member', 'cast.When', 'last', 'saw', 'team', 'had', 'barely', 'survived', 'most', 'recent', 'encounter', 'Pelant', 'final', 'twist', 'spite', 'Pelant', 'blackmailed', 'Booth', 'withdrawing', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'Bones', 'forbidding', 'reveal', 'reason', 'why', 'Booth', 'promise', 'strain', 'relationship', 'Bones', 'will', 'reach', 'out', 'old', 'Army', 'buddies', 'including', 'CIA', 'agent', 'former', 'priest', 'turned', 'bartender', 'advice', 'Pelant', 'own', 'plan', 'separating', 'Bones', 'Bones', 'Booth', 'permanently', 'entire', 'team', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'mettle', 'head', 'off', 'Pelant', 'insidious', 'plot.The', 'ninth', 'season', 'feature', 'crime', 'week', 'murders', 'Bones', 'Booth', 'Jeffersonian', 'lab', 'rats', 'solve', 'One', 'episode', 'will', 'have', 'Booth', 'Bones', 'resurrecting', 'undercover', 'Tony', 'Roxie', 'identities', 'hilarious', 'marriage', 'retreat', 'talk', 'too', 'frankly', 'relationship', 'Psychologist', 'Dr.', 'Sweets', 'will', 'take', 'leave', 'absence', 'work', 'outreach', 'center', 'only', 'find', 'drawn', 'back', 'gut-wrenching', 'case', 'involving', 'gang', 'feud', 'past', 'seasons', 'other', 'members', 'team', 'including', 'Lab', 'boss', 'Dr.', 'Saroyan', 'Dr.', 'Hodgins', 'Angela', 'interns', 'will', 'have', 'moments', 'spotlight.The', 'producers', 'Bones', 'have', 'promised', 'wedding', 'Booth', 'Bones', 'season', 'should', 'be', 'reason', 'enough', 'longtime', 'fans', 'tune', ""n't"", 'do', 'fans', 'scary-thrilling', 'season', 'finale', 'should', 'Bones', 'Complete', 'Ninth', 'Season', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans']",Bones: Season 9
1671146,AM0Q2JUS910ZQ,B00FE5MX74,"JEROME W, MARTIN","[1, 6]","This was a pretty good season, started darkly, and then ended darkly but some good stuff inbetween.  At last the Bonster and Boothtied the knot though in a kind of odd wedding ceremony.  I loved the vows they exchanged with Booth recalling the fact that they weregetting married on the grounds where they first met.  I did not like the fact that the Church burned down and the creep Daisy blamedBooth.  Why she continues to be on the show with Sweets I do not know; I don't like either of them, nor do I like the interns exceptfor Wendel and poor Zach who I wish they could bring back. This marriage was one of the highlights of this season, perhaps theehighlight.  Going on 10 years and Emily and David still look very good, though there are some changes showing.  I fear that now thatthey are together we may lose the funny little interplays or jabs that they used to throw at each other.  I also very uncomfortable withthe muslim on the show; especially since he is going with Cam who I really like.  I suspect this is another &#34;political correct&#34; move byfox.  The whole Moslem world is a war with the west and I would rather not see this on the show unless or until Moslems try to actcivilized.  I believe we are in for some hard times.  Note that I live in NY and saw the towers fall.  The moslem is said to be arefugee from Iran but he does not look Iranian; Iranians for the most part are Indo-Europeans and blood brothers with the Euros.He looks more Arabic which is ok but he should be more honestly portrayed.Overall, BONES continues to be one of the more intelligent shows on TV; there are many &#34;cop & crime&#34; shows now, most of them stink, especially Riccoli & Isles and Cold Justice.  There are  good ones too, such as CASTLE & THE MENTALIST, both which Ilove; again with similar premises to BONES: a little romance and crime fighting.  And I like the CSI shows too.  But BONES is thepilot for me and it got me started on the other shows.  Now Bones will be back for season # 10 and I fear this may be the last one.The producers promise the final episode of the last season will be a doosy.  It will be sad to say goodby, but who knows, I bebe premature.  We will just have to wait.  I did order season 9; I have all the episodes on my Video Library.  I am impatient to seehow the Booth, FBi situation is going to work out.  I gave season 8 only 3 stars if I remember right, but that was a big mistake: Itdeserved at least 4 and maybe 5 for some really fine episodes (except where they let the mooch Sweets move in with them).This one I gave 4 stars cause I did not like the last episode, though I do understand why they did that.  I do recommend this season to anyone who hasn't seen it; watch them nail Palant...Hooray!!  But Fox, please, exile Sweets & Daisy to Afganistan!!!I will be waiting for season 9 DVD from Amazon with baiting breath!!  enjoy.  And Emily is still so beautfull!!!!!!!",4,BONES FOR EVER AFTER,1403827200,"06 27, 2014",2014,2921,"['was', 'pretty', 'good', 'season', 'started', 'darkly', 'then', 'ended', 'darkly', 'good', 'stuff', 'inbetween', 'last', 'Bonster', 'Boothtied', 'knot', 'kind', 'odd', 'wedding', 'ceremony', 'loved', 'vows', 'exchanged', 'Booth', 'recalling', 'fact', 'weregetting', 'married', 'grounds', 'where', 'first', 'met', 'did', 'not', 'fact', 'Church', 'burned', 'down', 'creep', 'Daisy', 'blamedBooth', 'Why', 'be', 'show', 'Sweets', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'interns', 'exceptfor', 'Wendel', 'poor', 'Zach', 'who', 'wish', 'could', 'bring', 'back', 'marriage', 'was', 'one', 'highlights', 'season', 'perhaps', 'theehighlight', 'Going', '10', 'years', 'Emily', 'David', 'still', 'look', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'changes', 'showing', 'fear', 'now', 'are', 'together', 'may', 'lose', 'funny', 'little', 'interplays', 'jabs', 'used', 'throw', 'other', 'also', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'withthe', 'muslim', 'show', 'especially', 'going', 'Cam', 'who', 'really', 'suspect', '34', 'political', 'correct', '34', 'move', 'byfox', 'whole', 'Moslem', 'world', 'war', 'west', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'see', 'show', 'Moslems', 'try', 'actcivilized', 'believe', 'are', 'hard', 'times', 'Note', 'live', 'NY', 'saw', 'towers', 'fall', 'moslem', 'said', 'be', 'arefugee', 'Iran', 'not', 'look', 'Iranian', 'Iranians', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'Indo-Europeans', 'blood', 'brothers', 'Euros.He', 'more', 'Arabic', 'ok', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'honestly', 'portrayed.Overall', 'BONES', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'intelligent', 'shows', 'TV', 'are', 'many', '34', 'cop', 'crime', '34', 'shows', 'now', 'most', 'stink', 'especially', 'Riccoli', 'Isles', 'Cold', 'Justice', 'are', 'good', 'ones', 'too', 'such', 'CASTLE', 'THE', 'MENTALIST', 'Ilove', 'again', 'similar', 'premises', 'BONES', 'little', 'romance', 'crime', 'fighting', 'like', 'CSI', 'too', 'BONES', 'thepilot', 'got', 'started', 'other', 'shows', 'Now', 'Bones', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'season', '10', 'fear', 'may', 'be', 'last', 'one.The', 'producers', 'promise', 'final', 'episode', 'last', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'doosy', 'will', 'be', 'sad', 'say', 'goodby', 'who', 'bebe', 'premature', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'wait', 'did', 'order', 'season', '9', 'have', 'episodes', 'Video', 'Library', 'am', 'impatient', 'seehow', 'Booth', 'FBi', 'situation', 'going', 'work', 'out', 'gave', 'season', '8', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'remember', 'right', 'was', 'big', 'mistake', 'Itdeserved', 'least', '4', 'maybe', '5', 'really', 'fine', 'episodes', 'where', 'let', 'mooch', 'Sweets', 'move', '.This', 'one', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'cause', 'did', 'not', 'last', 'episode', 'do', 'understand', 'why', 'did', 'do', 'recommend', 'season', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'watch', 'nail', 'Palant', 'Hooray', 'Fox', 'please', 'exile', 'Sweets', 'Daisy', 'Afganistan', 'will', 'be', 'waiting', 'season', '9', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'baiting', 'breath', 'enjoy', 'Emily', 'still', 'so', 'beautfull']",Bones: Season 9
1671147,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B00FE5MX74,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[27, 31]","This was one of the best Bones series ever.  The stories were compelling but the writers are starting to get tired and it shows.  The storylines in this season was filled with lots of science fiction and psychic crap which takes away from the fun hard science feel of the show.  The serial killer angle is well developed in this season but I won't go into detail here no spoilers.  I pre-ordered this Bones Ninth Season meaning I paid full price and I don't feel ill used at all.  The writers are running on vapors if their Ninth Season scripts are any indication but even on lifesupport Bones stands head and shoulders above most other police procedural shows.  Bones is still funny.  Bones still makes you care about all its characters not just Booth and Bones.  They really did a great job developing Dr. Sweets from an almost child like character to a man an evolution that is fun to watch.  I gave Bones a five star because; Bones still has the capacity to move me, to make he laugh, cry and feel strong emotions based on what it shares.  Bones presents philosophical and moral points of view that leave me thinking for days about the right or wrong of its message.  Bones makes me think what would I do in the face of some of the challenges characters face.  This ninth season gave me a moral what if it were me choice I will never forget.  Fiction squint Hodgins is a very rich man.  The serial killer gave this rich man a choice save your fortune being drained away electronically but to do so condemn an innocent group of middle eastern humans to death via an attack drone.  Seeing this choice forced upon one of the Bones characters made me wonder which would I pick were I in the same situation.  I like to consider myself a moral and good man but could I let my entire life's fortune and economic security \ relative comfort it generates drain away to save poor innocent people I do not even know.  That episode was so powerful that the choice it put before me is etched into my little gray cells.  My heart, mind and soul are still wrestling with the question posed by a single episode of Ninth Season Bones.  When a TV series can make me think and question myself on this deep level its worth its full price in my book.",5,BONES IS JUST PURE AWESOME PERIOD.,1383955200,"11 9, 2013",2013,2233,"['was', 'one', 'best', 'Bones', 'series', 'ever', 'stories', 'were', 'compelling', 'writers', 'are', 'starting', 'get', 'tired', 'storylines', 'season', 'was', 'filled', 'lots', 'science', 'fiction', 'psychic', 'crap', 'away', 'fun', 'hard', 'science', 'feel', 'show', 'serial', 'killer', 'angle', 'well', 'developed', 'season', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'here', 'spoilers', 'pre-ordered', 'Bones', 'Ninth', 'Season', 'meaning', 'paid', 'full', 'price', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'ill', 'used', 'writers', 'are', 'running', 'vapors', 'Ninth', 'Season', 'scripts', 'are', 'indication', 'even', 'lifesupport', 'Bones', 'head', 'shoulders', 'most', 'other', 'police', 'procedural', 'shows', 'Bones', 'still', 'funny', 'Bones', 'still', 'care', 'characters', 'not', 'just', 'Booth', 'Bones', 'really', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'developing', 'Dr.', 'Sweets', 'almost', 'child', 'character', 'man', 'evolution', 'fun', 'watch', 'gave', 'Bones', 'five', 'star', 'Bones', 'still', 'capacity', 'move', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', 'feel', 'strong', 'emotions', 'based', 'what', 'shares', 'Bones', 'presents', 'philosophical', 'moral', 'points', 'view', 'leave', 'thinking', 'days', 'right', 'wrong', 'message', 'Bones', 'think', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'face', 'challenges', 'characters', 'face', 'ninth', 'season', 'gave', 'moral', 'what', 'were', 'choice', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'Fiction', 'squint', 'Hodgins', 'very', 'rich', 'man', 'serial', 'killer', 'gave', 'rich', 'man', 'choice', 'save', 'fortune', 'being', 'drained', 'away', 'electronically', 'do', 'so', 'condemn', 'innocent', 'group', 'middle', 'eastern', 'humans', 'death', 'attack', 'drone', 'Seeing', 'choice', 'forced', 'one', 'Bones', 'characters', 'made', 'wonder', 'would', 'pick', 'were', 'same', 'situation', 'like', 'consider', 'moral', 'good', 'man', 'could', 'let', 'entire', 'life', 'fortune', 'economic', 'security', '\\', 'relative', 'comfort', 'drain', 'away', 'save', 'poor', 'innocent', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'episode', 'was', 'so', 'powerful', 'choice', 'put', 'etched', 'little', 'gray', 'cells', 'My', 'heart', 'mind', 'soul', 'are', 'still', 'wrestling', 'question', 'posed', 'single', 'episode', 'Ninth', 'Season', 'Bones', 'When', 'TV', 'series', 'can', 'make', 'think', 'question', 'deep', 'level', 'worth', 'full', 'price', 'book']",Bones: Season 9
