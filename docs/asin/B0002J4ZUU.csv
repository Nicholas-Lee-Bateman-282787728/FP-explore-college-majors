Having loved seasons 1-3 I went into season 4 with an open mind, despite having been warned by a friend how terrible these final episodes were.My friend was right. Season 4 destroys all that went before it. It's as if the series was suddenly taken over by new writers who had no idea who the characters were. They took one look at the character of Dr. Marsham and said, ""We don't know who this older man with a mustache is but he's not particularly exciting or attractive, so he must be the villain"". As for Eleanor Bramwell, ""She's young and pretty so let's make her over-emotional and empty headed"".I could've excused the terrible filming of season 4, the awful lighting, extremely annoying music, the unexplained dissapearance of old characters who were mysteriously replaced without explanation or even acknowledgement. But when they used the final two episodes to turn Dr. Marsham (my favorite character) into the devil, and Eleanor (a previously flawed but mostly sympathetic heroine) into a fickle, empty headed, overwrought child, I had enough.Now I'm going to go back and watch seasons 1-3 again and pretend the 4th one doesn't exist.

Yep, she sure did.  She was haughty, proud (""I AM the Thrift!"")and headstrong, insisting on always having her way and it was always to the detriment of others.  In the first three seasons a baby died needlessly in her care as did her infirmary porter, she ruined one relationship after another and now in Season 4 a child prostitute was taken and murdered after she screamed and pleaded w/Dr. Bramwell not to let her go and all b/c Dr. Bramwell was angry and bitter b/c she was exposed for who she really was.  She chose bad boys and then whined and became angry when they treated her as bad boys do, w/disrespect.  The last one married her but they both admitted that it was a mistake but that didn't matter.  Dr. Bramwell got her way yet again.The first three seasons were excellent; hated the Eleanor Bramwell character but loved Jemma Redgrave's portrayal of her.  That rates 5 stars.  We truly got a taste of Victorian life both on the posh side and in the slums.  Then season 4 came along and it went south from there.I can't say that I didn't like the acting b/c I did, especially that of Jemma Redgrave as Eleanor Bramwell.  However, Season 4 is a travesty.  The changes that were made in the set, the lighting and the music alone made me fidget until the very end.  Marimbas and drums played throughout?  Please.Avoid Season 4.  Be content to be irritated w/Dr. Bramwell at the end of Season 3 b/c it'll be even worse next season.  I'm still mad at myself for sitting through Season 4.  I should've ejected it and forgotten it.

This drama series starring Gemma Redgrave as Eleanor Bramwell and set in Victoria London is one of the best to ever grace the television screen in recent years. Dr Bramwell tries to help the poorer working class by setting up a refuge whereby folk could be treated without having to pay, people often forget that back in those days a lot of folk died if they had little money to pay for a doctor. She also tried to educate those people on prevention of diseases.

As far as being a compelling series, well, it was right up there with Murder, She Wrote. Nice to watch, but towards the end, I wasn't exactly sitting on the edge of my seat.All the negatives you've read about Season 4 are true. Season 4 could've stood as a (bad) standalone 3-hour drama about a female doctor during the second Boer War. She's a bit like the person from the Bramwell series, but you'll find her a lot less likeable, a lot more cold, a lot more loose. There's not much in Season 4 to bridge to the first three seasons, so it's not like it'll ruin anything for you.The filming was noticeably different as was background music, which I never even noticed in Seasons 1 to 3.

As soon as it started, I could tell it wasn't the same as Seasons 1-3, which frankly had me hooked for hours on end.  It was difficult not to sit through the entire three seasons in one weekend. Wonderful portrayal of Victorian life, manners, courtship, class differences, evolution of medical knowledge, and a woman's place in society.  Can't say that I was always totally enthralled with Eleanor, who at times I wish I could knock up side the head.  Her character was a stubborn, independent, bull-headed woman whose opinion was always correct. However, her treatment of the poor and attitude toward the sick was her only salvation in my eyes.  Every other character that came and went throughout season 1-3 were great additions to the story. The love her life, however, was a scoundrel, as far as I was concerned, and Eleanor in all of her brilliance as a woman, didn't have an ounce of sense when it came to men. Season 4 finally gives to her marriage, but without the father in the last season, it sorely lacked his wisdom.  It would have been better to end it at three with her father's marriage.
