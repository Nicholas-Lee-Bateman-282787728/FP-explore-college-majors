1411432,AVR1TVB3NKTFO,B004JAUDK4,Johnny Goodwin,"[4, 5]","I really wanted to like this movie but when the previews for other movies started on the dvd, I knew Horrid was going to suck. And it did! Now Horrid was not the worst zombie movie I have seen... Darklands, the Rising wins that award hands down, but it was really close.So this guy is going to get married and his friends are giving him a bachelor party... it is just too bad that the guy's friends happen to be the biggest TOOLS on the face of the Earth! So they take him to some strip club that looks like it was a set built in someone's basement that had been converted into a den in the 1970s. And then from there they go to some po-dunk town that has nothing but a bar, woods, and possibility some military medical facility (how else would the infected patient made it to that town?).  Sounds like the ultimate of great bachelor parties.  But that isn't what makes Horrid HORRID....  It's the fact that the make-up looked like crap, the acting from most of the cast was stiff and the script /dialog was totally lame, emotionless, monotone, mindless babble.  I have seen better make-up on your average wanna-be ""fan boys"" at zombie walks and better acting in grade school plays. And, I am sure porn from the 1970s has better scripts.  The makers of Horrid needed to spend less time watching Cinamax After Dark soft core porn and Girls Gone Wild and more on character development, writing believable dialog for the script and working with all the actors so they ended up knowing their character and delivering convincing dialog.And so what have I FINALLY learned....  Low budget zombie movies, unless distributed by a big name studio, are a complete waste of your money and time and they SUCK! No, you don't have to be a total Hollywood tool with a mega bucks budget to make a good movie... you need to take your time and write dialog that real people would say at the appropriate settings and times and find people who can pretend that what is going on in the script / movie is real taking place around them. And make-up... sometimes less is more and no, black lines on the body do not look like realistic veins; colored, rolled up dried liquid latex applied with wet latex on the body looks like veins.",1,HORRID....

1411435,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B004JAUDK4,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","This low budget continuity issue zombie film takes place in Wisconsin. The movie opens with military personnel killing an infected human. These are fast moving zombies. We find out the cause of the infection about a third of the way into the film. Infected people sometimes speak with voice enhancers, sometimes without the enhancer, while others are typical blue faced mutes. Make-up was not consistent either.We then move to the subplot which makes attempts at humor. Matt (Roland James Williams) gets his car repossessed then asks to borrow his ex-girlfriend's car as she is walking out the door. He and Craig (Kyle Berg) have a bachelor party planned for John (Kevin Kiser). After getting thrown out of a strip club, they head up north to a small town so the subplots can be united in zombie bliss.The acting was at the Mendoza line and the dialouge better than most low budget disasters. The film extra features a band, one that must have been used for a better than average metal sound track. The film has numerous gratuitous nude scenes that make it into both the outtakes and extended scenes, one which included a sex scene with the woman being disgusted and swearing that I thought should have stayed in the film.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (thank you Liz Ribarchek, Amber Rae Halama, Jocelyn Ridgely, plus an extra and 2-3 strippers) 3 1/2 stars",4,CAN I BORROW YOUR CAR?,1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,1363,"['low', 'budget', 'continuity', 'issue', 'zombie', 'film', 'place', 'Wisconsin', 'movie', 'military', 'personnel', 'killing', 'infected', 'human', 'are', 'fast', 'moving', 'zombies', 'find', 'out', 'cause', 'infection', 'third', 'way', 'film', 'Infected', 'people', 'sometimes', 'speak', 'voice', 'enhancers', 'sometimes', 'enhancer', 'others', 'are', 'typical', 'blue', 'faced', 'mutes', 'Make-up', 'was', 'not', 'consistent', 'either.We', 'then', 'move', 'subplot', 'attempts', 'humor', 'Matt', 'Roland', 'James', 'Williams', 'car', 'repossessed', 'then', 'borrow', 'ex-girlfriend', 'car', 'walking', 'out', 'door', 'Craig', 'Kyle', 'Berg', 'have', 'bachelor', 'party', 'planned', 'John', 'Kevin', 'Kiser', 'getting', 'thrown', 'strip', 'club', 'head', 'up', 'north', 'small', 'town', 'subplots', 'can', 'be', 'united', 'zombie', 'bliss.The', 'acting', 'was', 'Mendoza', 'line', 'dialouge', 'better', 'most', 'low', 'budget', 'disasters', 'film', 'extra', 'band', 'one', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'better', 'average', 'metal', 'sound', 'track', 'film', 'numerous', 'gratuitous', 'nude', 'scenes', 'make', 'outtakes', 'extended', 'scenes', 'one', 'included', 'sex', 'scene', 'woman', 'being', 'disgusted', 'swearing', 'thought', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'film.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bomb', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Liz', 'Ribarchek', 'Amber', 'Rae', 'Halama', 'Jocelyn', 'Ridgely', 'extra', '2-3', 'strippers', '3', '1/2', 'stars']",Horrid
