Burroughs,"[0, 0]","I tuned to this PBS special late one insomniac night when nothing else was on and was pleasantly surprised at this lighthearted, funny documentary.  However, it is the segment about the neighborhood battle against 100 cockfighting roosters crowing at all hours of the day and night that really changed my thinking.  I never would have read Sun Tzu's 6th-century military treatise ""The Art of War"" own my own.  However, the way the neighborhood takes inspiration to wage an uphill battle against an obnoxious neighbor and lax zoning boards is ""Grass Roots 101"" and I have used (or used against those who would use) the feathery version of The Art of War many times in my life since then.Not just for chicken lovers ... this film has merit beyond feathered companions.",5,"Feathery version of Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War""",1274313600,"05 20, 2010",2010,766,"['tuned', 'PBS', 'special', 'late', 'one', 'insomniac', 'night', 'when', 'nothing', 'else', 'was', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'lighthearted', 'funny', 'documentary', 'However', 'segment', 'neighborhood', 'battle', '100', 'cockfighting', 'roosters', 'crowing', 'hours', 'day', 'night', 'really', 'changed', 'thinking', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'read', 'Sun', 'Tzu', '6th-century', 'military', 'treatise', 'Art', 'War', 'own', 'own', 'However', 'way', 'neighborhood', 'inspiration', 'wage', 'uphill', 'battle', 'obnoxious', 'neighbor', 'lax', 'zoning', 'boards', 'Grass', 'Roots', '101', 'have', 'used', 'used', 'who', 'would', 'use', 'feathery', 'version', 'Art', 'War', 'many', 'times', 'life', 'then.Not', 'just', 'chicken', 'lovers', 'film', 'merit', 'feathered', 'companions']",The Natural History of the Chicken VHS

At times this DVD seems to be a half-baked attempt to discourage people from eating chicken from the grocery store and raise chickens on their own. At times it appears bent on making people look ridiculous (most of us don't need help).

Chickens tend to be under-appreciated considering the numbers of them it takes to feed us.  Eggs, McNuggets, buffalo wings, Teriyaki, chow mein, etc.There are several people in this program who are clearly absorbed with the Nature of the Chicken.  They dearly LOVE chickens--but they are people who probably love cats, dogs, kids, and other people, too.Chickens seem much more special after watching this program.",5,"Share the Love, Hug a Chicken",1095033600,"09 13, 2004",2004,675,"['great', 'program', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'chickens.The', 'program', 'across', 'bit', 'anthropomorphic', 'very', 'sensitive', 'very', 'enlightening', 'very', 'engrossing', 'insightful', 'look', 'life', 'fellow', 'creature', 'too', 'often', 'take', 'granted', 'Chickens', 'tend', 'be', 'under-appreciated', 'considering', 'numbers', 'feed', 'Eggs', 'McNuggets', 'buffalo', 'wings', 'Teriyaki', 'chow', 'mein', 'are', 'several', 'people', 'program', 'who', 'are', 'clearly', 'absorbed', 'Nature', 'Chicken', 'dearly', 'LOVE', 'chickens', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'probably', 'love', 'cats', 'dogs', 'kids', 'other', 'people', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'special', 'watching', 'program']",The Natural History of the Chicken VHS
