677867,A15D2X8MICR2VQ,B00005R26T,Ephany,"[8, 9]","It is a cute video and my daughter enjoys watching and dancing along with it. There's lots of cameos of the children in the audience (which my daughter loves). Also there's a good variety of songs, (many of which we were familiar with from Noggin).Pros-Lots of songs that encourage dancing and interaction with your childLots of screen time of the children in the audienceSimple songs and lyrics that my daughter can sing along with.My daughter likes the simple animation and older bluescreen technology.The audio on our tape is crisp and clear, no buzzing, humming, or any other noises aside from the concert.Cons-This is not what they show on Noggin, this is a taping of a concert from 4 or 5 years ago, and it is very evident.The funky book that showcases the video cuts off about 30% of the useable screen. I would have preferred that the whole video be shot in full screen without the annoying black spaces around the edges.I'm not too thrilled with the clothes Laurie and Susie are wearing, I'd have expected those dresses on a teenager going to a rave, not on the singers at a children's concert.This video is only available in VHS, not in a DVD format. For $3 or $4 more, I'd rather have gotten a DVD.Overall, I'm happy with the video and would recommend it for anyone who's children enjoy the shorts on Noggin. The things that irk me about the video, my daughter doesn't even notice, and it's her opinion that really counts. :)",4,"Not what I expected, but cute anyway.",1115251200,"05 5, 2005",2005,1436,"['cute', 'video', 'daughter', 'watching', 'dancing', 'along', 'lots', 'cameos', 'children', 'audience', 'daughter', 'loves', 'Also', 'good', 'variety', 'songs', 'many', 'were', 'familiar', 'Noggin', '.Pros-Lots', 'songs', 'encourage', 'dancing', 'interaction', 'childLots', 'screen', 'time', 'children', 'audienceSimple', 'songs', 'lyrics', 'daughter', 'can', 'sing', 'along', 'with.My', 'daughter', 'simple', 'animation', 'older', 'bluescreen', 'technology.The', 'audio', 'tape', 'crisp', 'clear', 'buzzing', 'humming', 'other', 'noises', 'aside', 'concert.Cons-This', 'not', 'what', 'show', 'Noggin', 'taping', 'concert', '4', '5', 'years', 'ago', 'very', 'evident.The', 'funky', 'book', 'video', '30', '%', 'useable', 'screen', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'whole', 'video', 'be', 'shot', 'full', 'screen', 'annoying', 'black', 'spaces', 'edges.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'thrilled', 'clothes', 'Laurie', 'Susie', 'are', 'wearing', ""'d"", 'have', 'expected', 'dresses', 'teenager', 'going', 'rave', 'not', 'singers', 'children', 'concert.This', 'video', 'only', 'available', 'VHS', 'not', 'DVD', 'format', '3', '4', 'more', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'gotten', 'DVD.Overall', ""'m"", 'happy', 'video', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'children', 'enjoy', 'shorts', 'Noggin', 'things', 'irk', 'video', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'opinion', 'really']",N/A

She and her brother (now 3 and 18 months) LOVE this video!  I was just doing a search to see if there are more yet, but sadly not!  It isn't the most professionally done video (seems pretty low-budget) but the kids don't seem to notice, in fact they LOVE the parts where the filming is done in an inset screen shaped like a drawn book and another character keeps trying to climb ""into"" the book where Laurie and another singer are performing to a group of kids, apparently at a birthday party.  The songs are quite silly and imaginative, and my husband and I find ourselves singing along (and humming them after the video is done).  I recommend seeing her in person if possible and definitely buying this video for young children!",5,My toddler's lover her like Raffi!,1029283200,"08 14, 2002",2002,819,"['bought', 'Laurie', 'Berkner', 'concert', 'becuase', 'daughter', 'then', '2', 'loved', 'show', 'brother', 'now', '3', '18', 'months', 'LOVE', 'video', 'was', 'just', 'doing', 'search', 'see', 'are', 'more', 'yet', 'sadly', 'not', ""n't"", 'most', 'professionally', 'done', 'video', 'pretty', 'low-budget', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'notice', 'fact', 'LOVE', 'parts', 'where', 'filming', 'done', 'inset', 'screen', 'shaped', 'drawn', 'book', 'character', 'trying', 'climb', 'book', 'where', 'Laurie', 'singer', 'are', 'performing', 'group', 'kids', 'apparently', 'birthday', 'party', 'songs', 'are', 'quite', 'silly', 'imaginative', 'husband', 'find', 'singing', 'along', 'humming', 'video', 'done', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'person', 'possible', 'definitely', 'buying', 'video', 'young', 'children']",N/A

Milk just won't do anymore so I've learned to turn on the ""boob tube"". Now I have to get creative , because the news , really doesn't get him out of his moods , so I turned on the Noggin channel. He loves the Noggin shows. But the only thing that he loves more is this red pants lady who plays a guitar and can't dance.But she sure is entertaining and fun to watch.  I intially saw Laurie Berkner on the Noggin Channel , singing ""Victor Vito"". My son and I were inbetween shows , suddenly , this lady comes on with red pants and a colorful shirt and is singing chidren's songs and playing a guitar. My son was amazed and couldn't take his eyes , of the screen. I couldn't either because , although she's got no rhythm.....she ain't hard on the eyes. Shortly , after that initial viewing , I found myself anticipating her videos , inbetween shows. I guess it was destined that I visited her website and saw that she had released a video. Although , it's poor format , and not put together , incredibly creatively...there's no denying that she's got the stuff , to make the kids happy. She's like a female Mr.Rogers. But I'm only speaking comparatively , in terms of her attraction , for the kids. Because I never got a video of Mr. Rogers and I grew up with him. My son loves the video and I highly recommend it. To be perfectly honest.....I kinda like it too. Because she's hot and I can't get in trouble for entertaining my kids.",4,Victor Va  Va Voom !!!,1090195200,"07 19, 2004",2004,1547,"['son', 'up', 'early', 'never', 'monotonous', 'get', 'healthy', 'mix', 'getting', 'up', 'early', 'crankiness', 'Milk', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'anymore', 'so', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'turn', 'boob', 'tube', 'Now', 'have', 'get', 'creative', 'news', 'really', ""n't"", 'get', 'moods', 'turned', 'Noggin', 'channel', 'Noggin', 'shows', 'only', 'thing', 'more', 'red', 'pants', 'lady', 'who', 'guitar', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dance.But', 'sure', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'watch', 'intially', 'saw', 'Laurie', 'Berkner', 'Noggin', 'Channel', 'singing', 'Victor', 'Vito', 'son', 'were', 'inbetween', 'shows', 'suddenly', 'lady', 'red', 'pants', 'colorful', 'shirt', 'singing', 'chidren', 'songs', 'playing', 'guitar', 'son', 'was', 'amazed', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'screen', 'could', ""n't"", 'either', 'because', 'got', 'rhythm', '..she', 'ai', ""n't"", 'hard', 'eyes', 'Shortly', 'initial', 'viewing', 'found', 'anticipating', 'videos', 'inbetween', 'shows', 'guess', 'was', 'destined', 'visited', 'website', 'saw', 'had', 'released', 'video', 'poor', 'format', 'not', 'put', 'together', 'incredibly', 'creatively', 'denying', 'got', 'stuff', 'make', 'kids', 'happy', 'female', 'Mr.Rogers', ""'m"", 'only', 'speaking', 'comparatively', 'terms', 'attraction', 'kids', 'never', 'got', 'video', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'grew', 'up', 'son', 'video', 'highly', 'recommend', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', '..I', 'kinda', 'too', 'hot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'trouble', 'entertaining', 'kids']",N/A
