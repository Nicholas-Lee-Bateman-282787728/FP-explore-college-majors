784035,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B0000UJL3W,Chris Kennison,"[9, 18]","I purchased this DVD for one reason. CHANDRA WEST. I have a knack for noticing future talent. Long before everybody knew who Naomi Watts was, I was a huge fan. Long before everybody knew who Kate Beckinsale was, I was a fan.The same goes for Chandra (Puppet Master 4&5, Night Terrors, Something More & The Salton Sea). As of today, her most noteable movie was The Salton Sea, and in that, she had a tiny tiny role, delegated only to FLASHBACKS!!Finally, in WATER'S EDGE, she gets a starring role and shows how good of an actress she can be and has always been. In Water's Edge, she has some very meaty and dramatic moments. Most noteably, a very gut churning scene that involves a shotgun and a firepoker.Okay... enough about Chandra... now, what I thought about the movie.WATER'S EDGE starts out quietly when our main characters Robert (Nathan Fillion) and Molly (Chandra West) move to a quiet little town into a very modest log cabin, because they need a change of pace, to get away from the memory of their daughters drowning death, to write a book and they're broke.We quickly learn that all's not kosher in this family. Depression plagues Molly and their relationship is hanging on by a very thin emotional thread.That being said, I won't give away anything else, but I will say that the movie starts off EXCELLENTLY. Things start to happen and you don't see them coming. The events are unique, challenging and pose a very very good premise or dilemma for our characters to deal with.Our characters find themselves in a very unexpected, complex, dangerous and deadly situation. Not to mention, their harboring a young seductive girl named Rae (Emmanuelle Vaugier) from the same dangers.Everything builds as any good movie would. The tension is good. The dilemma our characters face is complex and intelligent enough to lock you in, and all of a sudden the movie sort of becomes... typical.What could have been a really really good LOW BUDGET movie, just becomes another movie because at the halfway point, the movie stopped growing, the story lost its creativity and ended the same way most movies of this sort end.So, the movie only gets 3 stars (could have been 4 stars had it finished the way it started).... ahh... you know... the casting Director did have the keen insight of casting Chandra West in a leading role.  I guess I'll throw that extra star back in for the Chandra factor.",4,Promise of a STELLAR beginning and premise... got away,1076803200,"02 15, 2004",2004,2393,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'one', 'reason', 'CHANDRA', 'WEST', 'have', 'knack', 'noticing', 'future', 'talent', 'Long', 'everybody', 'knew', 'who', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'was', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'Long', 'everybody', 'knew', 'who', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'was', 'was', 'fan.The', 'same', 'Chandra', 'Puppet', 'Master', '4', '5', 'Night', 'Terrors', 'Something', 'More', 'Salton', 'Sea', 'today', 'most', 'noteable', 'movie', 'was', 'Salton', 'Sea', 'had', 'tiny', 'tiny', 'role', 'delegated', 'only', 'FLASHBACKS', 'Finally', 'WATER', 'EDGE', 'starring', 'role', 'how', 'good', 'actress', 'can', 'be', 'always', 'been', 'Water', 'Edge', 'very', 'meaty', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'Most', 'noteably', 'very', 'gut', 'churning', 'scene', 'shotgun', 'firepoker.Okay', 'enough', 'Chandra', 'now', 'what', 'thought', 'movie.WATER', 'EDGE', 'out', 'quietly', 'when', 'main', 'characters', 'Robert', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Molly', 'Chandra', 'West', 'move', 'quiet', 'little', 'town', 'very', 'modest', 'log', 'cabin', 'need', 'change', 'pace', 'get', 'away', 'memory', 'daughters', 'drowning', 'death', 'write', 'book', ""'re"", 'broke.We', 'quickly', 'learn', 'not', 'kosher', 'family', 'Depression', 'Molly', 'relationship', 'hanging', 'very', 'thin', 'emotional', 'thread.That', 'being', 'said', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'anything', 'else', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'off', 'EXCELLENTLY', 'Things', 'start', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'events', 'are', 'unique', 'challenging', 'pose', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'premise', 'dilemma', 'characters', 'deal', 'with.Our', 'characters', 'find', 'very', 'unexpected', 'complex', 'dangerous', 'deadly', 'situation', 'Not', 'mention', 'harboring', 'young', 'seductive', 'girl', 'named', 'Rae', 'Emmanuelle', 'Vaugier', 'same', 'dangers.Everything', 'builds', 'good', 'movie', 'would', 'tension', 'good', 'dilemma', 'characters', 'face', 'complex', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'lock', 'sudden', 'movie', 'sort', 'becomes', 'typical.What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'LOW', 'BUDGET', 'movie', 'just', 'movie', 'halfway', 'point', 'movie', 'stopped', 'growing', 'story', 'lost', 'creativity', 'ended', 'same', 'way', 'most', 'movies', 'sort', 'end.So', 'movie', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'could', 'have', 'been', '4', 'stars', 'had', 'finished', 'way', 'started', 'ahh', 'know', 'casting', 'Director', 'did', 'have', 'keen', 'insight', 'casting', 'Chandra', 'West', 'leading', 'role', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'throw', 'extra', 'star', 'back', 'Chandra', 'factor']",Water's Edge

784040,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000UJL3W,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[12, 13]","Robert (Nathan Fillion) and Molly Graves (Chandra West) are trying to keep it together after the death of their young daughter.  He is a writing who is now unable to write anything, and so the couple end up at his late father's cabin in the small rural community of Reedsville.  Molly is haunted by a terrible dream and is doing a bit more than contemplating suicide.  Finding that Molly has loaded his father's old shotgun, Robert takes the gun and run out of the hunting cabin into the woods.  This seemed like a good idea at the time, but in the woods he stumbles across a strange scene: A sheriff has dragged a handcuffed young woman out of his cop car in the middle of the forest and is about to kill her.  Robert intervenes, which means he and Molly are suddenly up to their necks in the cesspool of small town corruption.Robert has saved the life of Rae Baines (Emmanuelle Vaugier), and of course he wants to know why the sheriff was about to bash her head in with a rock.  An explanation is not forthcoming, and Robert's suspicions are aroused when he discovers $200,000 and some lewd photographs of Rae in the sheriff's car.  Clearly there is something rotten going on in Reedsville and since they are in the middle of nowhere, Robert has nobody he can trust.  This actually works out because apparently nobody in Reedsville is trustworthy, from Mayor Block (Daniel Baldwin) on down.  But Robert and Molly are in way over their heads.  At least their martial problems no longer seem that that important.Obviously the main attraction for this 2003 direct to DVD movie is Nathan Fillion, who has a legion of fans because of his starring role on Joss Whedon's ""Firefly,"" which translated into the theatrical film ""Serenity.""  But unless you harbor dreams that he is going to show up on your doorstep and propose to you out of a clear blue sky, this is clearly a rental.  Fillion and West both provide fine performances, but Vaugier cannot carry off the shifts required to keep stirring up the plot in this one.  Fortunately, the rest of the characters keep things fairly low-keyed, so things never descend into caricature, but the initial set up slowly descends into fairly standard action, including a gunfight where people are shooting in and out of a house without bothering to use the windows.  Except for a handful of trailers there are no special features on this DVD, which just reinforces that ""Water's Edge"" is essentially a curiosity for Fillion's fans.",3,"""Firefly"" fans will watch this for Nathan Fillion and they will not find much more than him",1144022400,"04 3, 2006",2006,2469,"['Robert', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Molly', 'Graves', 'Chandra', 'West', 'are', 'trying', 'keep', 'together', 'death', 'young', 'daughter', 'writing', 'who', 'now', 'unable', 'write', 'anything', 'so', 'couple', 'end', 'up', 'late', 'father', 'cabin', 'small', 'rural', 'community', 'Reedsville', 'Molly', 'haunted', 'terrible', 'dream', 'doing', 'bit', 'more', 'contemplating', 'suicide', 'Finding', 'Molly', 'loaded', 'father', 'old', 'shotgun', 'Robert', 'gun', 'run', 'out', 'hunting', 'cabin', 'woods', 'seemed', 'good', 'idea', 'time', 'woods', 'strange', 'scene', 'sheriff', 'dragged', 'handcuffed', 'young', 'woman', 'cop', 'car', 'middle', 'forest', 'kill', 'Robert', 'intervenes', 'Molly', 'are', 'suddenly', 'necks', 'cesspool', 'small', 'town', 'corruption.Robert', 'saved', 'life', 'Rae', 'Baines', 'Emmanuelle', 'Vaugier', 'course', 'know', 'why', 'sheriff', 'was', 'bash', 'head', 'rock', 'explanation', 'not', 'forthcoming', 'Robert', 'suspicions', 'are', 'aroused', 'when', '200,000', 'lewd', 'photographs', 'Rae', 'sheriff', 'car', 'Clearly', 'something', 'rotten', 'going', 'Reedsville', 'are', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Robert', 'nobody', 'can', 'trust', 'actually', 'out', 'because', 'apparently', 'nobody', 'Reedsville', 'trustworthy', 'Mayor', 'Block', 'Daniel', 'Baldwin', 'down', 'Robert', 'Molly', 'are', 'way', 'heads', 'least', 'martial', 'problems', 'no', 'longer', 'seem', 'important.Obviously', 'main', 'attraction', '2003', 'direct', 'DVD', 'movie', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'who', 'legion', 'fans', 'starring', 'role', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Firefly', 'translated', 'theatrical', 'film', 'Serenity', 'harbor', 'dreams', 'going', 'show', 'up', 'doorstep', 'propose', 'clear', 'blue', 'sky', 'clearly', 'rental', 'Fillion', 'West', 'provide', 'fine', 'performances', 'Vaugier', 'can', 'not', 'carry', 'off', 'shifts', 'required', 'keep', 'stirring', 'up', 'plot', 'one', 'Fortunately', 'rest', 'characters', 'keep', 'things', 'fairly', 'low-keyed', 'things', 'never', 'descend', 'caricature', 'initial', 'set', 'up', 'slowly', 'fairly', 'standard', 'action', 'including', 'gunfight', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'shooting', 'house', 'bothering', 'use', 'windows', 'handful', 'trailers', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'just', 'Water', 'Edge', 'essentially', 'curiosity', 'Fillion', 'fans']",Water's Edge
