I regret, however, that the writers of the film decided to retain certain parts of the book. In particular, while the old man was arm wrestling with the other man it was decided that the other man should be referred to as the Negro as if he was not a human being and only a color. I would also have objected had the old man been referred to as the Blanco.

Director John Sturges and screenwriter Peter Viertel retain much of Ernest Hemingway's symbolism, making of Santiago a Christ-like figure.  A more apt Biblical analog might be Job; like him, Santiago endures the indignities and strife thrust upon him, but perseveres and endures while retaining his appreciation of nature and simple pleasures./There is a lot of voice-over narration in this film.  In addition to playing Santiago, Tracy reads excerpts from the novel to deepen and comment upon the action.  In most cases, I would be annoyed by such pervasive intrusion, but it makes sense here because Santiago spends so much time alone.

This is one of the few movies which have been made from novels that hit pretty close to the mark as to following the original plot and following the author's intentions.It has been quite a number of years since I first saw this film and to be frank, I had forgotten much.  I was delighted to give this one another viewing and assess it though the eyes of a much, much older man.  I was not disappointed.  The plot is pretty well known; or most certainly should be by now, so I will not give a blow by blow account.  Suffice to say that the Old Man, Santiago has gone for a total of 84 days without catching a fish.  Spencer Tracy, playing the lead as Santiago sets out despite the loss of respect (for lack of a better term) of his village and despite the fact that he has lost confidence in his abilities.Tracy plays his part as well as I have seen an actor play any part in any movie.  He has it down perfect.This entire movie is the story of a man; a man against nature.  There are no scenes of things being blown up, there are no vampires, there is little to no sharp dialog and I fear that by today's movie standards that this movie will no longer appeal to everyone.  It is an extremely thoughtful movie which strips human emotions down to the bare bone, slowly a layer at a time.  Most of the movie, like the novel is purely symbolic - a method of writing and indeed, movie making that is becoming quite rare these days.  This movie causes; or at least should cause, the viewer to become rather introspective as to him or her self and as to humanity and nature overall.Yes, we have an old man battling a very big fish under what we now would consider very primitive conditions.  The real battle though is not between the man and the fish, but rather the man against himself.  Tracy does a spectacular job in this area.  It is not the sort of role you would expect Tracy to play but I have to tell you that I feel he nails it perfectly.Even the interaction between the Old Man and the young boy is symbolic in nature in that the story allows us to consider faith and respect.  And as to ""respect,"" the story also forces us to evaluate and examine our respect, or in some cases, our lack of respect for ""Nature.""  This is an aspect of living in our modern world that we quite too often fail, much to our detriment.Excellent movie but as I said, this one will not be for everyone.

559566,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00004YRID,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA (1958) for all its legendary greatness is really not all that great. As a lifelong admirer and superfan of Spencer Tracy, I enjoyed watching this film - today, for the first and probably only time. It's just that Hemingway - a writer I will never bother to read - is not my cup of tea.This film is a good example of why that is ....Tracy is brilliant, naturally, as Santiago, ""the old man"" - at least I heard the boy call him Santiago. (Young Felipe Pazos is almost frightening as the boy, a little hood-in-the-making if ever I saw one.) The old man is a simple Cuban fisherman, who goes out in his little skiff like all the others living by the sea near Old Havana. One day as he goes it alone, he hooks a giant swordfish (or giant marlin if you prefer). As it fights, he fights back, and it takes him as far as the Sargasso Sea.It's bigger than his boat, and he finally lands it after a week. Back in Havana, he mourns the nearly skeletalized marlin - devoured by sharks long before he could hope to land it. There are great, cruel fishing scenes here: a marlin on the hook, sharks being harpooned, stabbed and bludgeoned. I also loved the close-up shots of a pro line fisherman working the line and knotting it as needed.Sadly, it is plain those are not Tracy's hands or feet.The production values are great; the Foley and sound are awful. Typical of the 1950s. The funny story I know about this film is Tracy wanted a Cuban to teach him the correct accent, as he wanted to perform the part in English with a perfect Cuban lilt. He couldn't find anyone to teach him! Bless his heart, he tried a bit at the accent early on; sadly, it left him completely after the first 15 minutes of this 80 minute film.This film is a wonderful, quiet and meditative film ... about what struck me as a simple metaphor for the writer's sometimes miserable life. Directed by the great John Sturges and written for the screen by Peter Viertel, this is a film I recommend to all and sundry. However, it won't find its way into my collection.I love Spencer Tracy, always have and always will.

I prefer this same film done with Anthony Quinn. True- Quinn  always played Zorba the Greek whatever he did, which turned out to be what he was like in person in anycase. In The Old Man and The Sea he brought earthiness and reality to the role, which seems missing played by Spenser Tracey,who only brings a sense of earnestness to the part if you will excuse the pun. He does not seem dark enough to carry Hemmingways musings of survival of the fittest, mortality and that a man's life is no more significant than a fish's in the scheme of big time and oblivion. And if so,  as a man, shouldn't he hang on with all his might; tight onto the tiger's tail of his own existance?The book is more profound and descriptive. I'm not sure it so easily translates to film. It was so depressing and sad I could not finish the book ; likewise the film is an exercise in futility. The fisherman kept loosing parts of the fish on the return journey  after it took so much out of him to catch it .During the film it became a very ominous question if he had a right to hunt the big fish to death in the first place. Since the fish itself was no doubt going through the same desperation to be rid of the hook in its mouth; free of hauling that heavy boat for miles in a bid to break the line and swim back freed into the deep ocean. And why? So the villagers wouldn't treat him like an old loser ? It's senseless because he is too old to care what they think of him. Or is it to show there is a tooth left in the old dog yet? Or to set an example for the boy in dumb machismo?Hemmingway advocates the carnivores' supremacy. For all the violence and terror of the animal kingdom, mostly animals kill only for food , quickly and humanly. Hemmingway enjoyed the sado-machismo of bull-fighting and big-game hunting for sport . Then tries to convince me there is pathos and cruel glory in writing The Old Man And The Sea involving the l-o-n-g death of a noble fish. Then rubs my nose in the pointlessness of it all for the hunter as the fisherman......No.....the fisherman should have cut the line on the big fish and stop all the senseless hurt and struggle. Whatever the metaphors are in the book or the film ( and there are many ) the motive is to do with a man who realises he is living in the last sunsets of his life. Therefore : Is one last big lucky catch truly a needed epitaph on a long, worthy life packed with happy memories?  I think not. It's all angst based on egotism. Or a possible stigma about not have a wad of sweaty dollars hidden in the mattress to prove his manhood.There is something terribly upsetting going on with book and film. I don't want to understand why or analyse why. My  guts tell me its all a senseless and destructive musing.

The story focuses on Santiago, an old man who has spent 84 days without catching a fish. Spencer Tracey plays the old man to perfection for the most part, as he sets out on the 85th day to capture his big prize. While it isn't a movie that blows you away with either script or action, it is a film with a purpose.Perhaps what most viewers or critics of this movie won't get is that it is richly symbolic in nature, and therefore probably won't appeal to viewers who lack attention spans. Most of Santiago's stuggle is within himself, and his age is a symbol for wisdom and perseverance. The boy, his counterpart, continually befriends him in hopes that the one day will arrive when he brings home the big catch.The movie really is a testament to Man versus Nature, and is able to depict this sucessfully. One of the most essential points of the story is not only Santiago's respect for the sea and its inhabitants, but the essential quality of being successful at something.If you are expecting a ton of action, or some big crash or storm scenes, then this probably isn't your movie.

He only dreamed of places now......"" the places of his youth.This is a movie that requires soul searching.  It is partially about aging and what it does to the mind and body; the body because that is simply organic and must return gradually to the earth (or to the sea) and the mind because it is far above the body, it's anguish magnified tenfold by what it knows is happening but is powerless to control anymore.  It is a tale of triumph and defeat; of the strange and infuriating elements of ""luck and nature"" that life is made of.  There is background narrative of excerpts from the book which underscores the power of Hemingway's intent for those who take the time to feel the movie as well as see it.In a strange role reversal, the Old Man (Spencer Tracy) is being taken care of by a boy who lives in the same fishing village; a boy who somehow is connected with him through tradition and unexplained psyche.  The boy is refusing to let the Old Man give up - because he somehow recognizes that this man had been a ""man of men"" who must not be abandoned in his old age.  On this fateful morning, the Old Man awakens early, hoping for ""good luck"" goes back out equipped with bait supplied by the boy.  Many times during the journey, the Old Man ""wishes the boy were there"" with him, grasping for the youthful vigor ""of the as yet undefeated spirit"" to support him.The sea in the early morning light is breathtaking - the light of dawn touching the water, blue clouds drifting past a silver moon peeking out behind; a flock of sea birds diving and calling as they too, pit themselves against the open ocean in search of sustenance.  This untrammeled ethereal splendor soon turns to physical fury as the Old man actually rows out into a school of Marlin, and his ""luck"" changes.  The struggle with the Marlin is beautiful and breathtaking; blue sea erupting in white foam as the magnificent fish leaps and crashes back in sprays of animated glory.  As I watched the struggle, I couldn't help but wonder why the old boy didn't just give a wrap or two around the knob on the front of his boat, dally style rather than watching the skin disappear from his hands beneath the fury of the fish during the fight; but I didn't write the script.The final poignant scenes as the Old Man returns to his village after his battle with sea and fin - are some that almost everyone can identify with at some time or another in their own life's drama.",5,"""All Alone Am I.......""",1330732800,"03 3, 2012",2012,2587,"['longer', 'dreamed', 'storms', 'women', 'great', 'occurrences', 'great', 'fish', 'fights', 'contests', 'strength', 'wife', 'only', 'dreamed', 'places', 'now', 'places', 'youth.This', 'movie', 'soul', 'searching', 'partially', 'aging', 'what', 'mind', 'body', 'body', 'simply', 'organic', 'must', 'return', 'gradually', 'earth', 'sea', 'mind', 'far', 'body', 'anguish', 'magnified', 'tenfold', 'what', 'happening', 'powerless', 'control', 'anymore', 'tale', 'triumph', 'defeat', 'strange', 'infuriating', 'elements', 'luck', 'nature', 'life', 'made', 'background', 'narrative', 'excerpts', 'book', 'power', 'Hemingway', 'intent', 'who', 'take', 'time', 'feel', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'strange', 'role', 'reversal', 'Old', 'Man', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'being', 'taken', 'care', 'boy', 'who', 'same', 'fishing', 'village', 'boy', 'who', 'somehow', 'connected', 'tradition', 'unexplained', 'psyche', 'boy', 'refusing', 'let', 'Old', 'Man', 'give', 'up', 'somehow', 'man', 'had', 'been', 'man', 'men', 'who', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'abandoned', 'old', 'age', 'fateful', 'morning', 'Old', 'Man', 'early', 'hoping', 'good', 'luck', 'back', 'out', 'equipped', 'bait', 'supplied', 'boy', 'Many', 'times', 'journey', 'Old', 'Man', 'boy', 'were', 'there', 'grasping', 'youthful', 'vigor', 'yet', 'undefeated', 'spirit', 'support', 'him.The', 'sea', 'early', 'morning', 'light', 'breathtaking', 'light', 'dawn', 'touching', 'water', 'blue', 'clouds', 'drifting', 'silver', 'moon', 'peeking', 'out', 'flock', 'sea', 'birds', 'diving', 'calling', 'too', 'pit', 'open', 'ocean', 'search', 'sustenance', 'untrammeled', 'ethereal', 'splendor', 'soon', 'physical', 'fury', 'Old', 'man', 'actually', 'out', 'school', 'Marlin', 'luck', 'changes', 'struggle', 'Marlin', 'beautiful', 'breathtaking', 'sea', 'erupting', 'white', 'foam', 'magnificent', 'fish', 'leaps', 'crashes', 'back', 'sprays', 'animated', 'glory', 'watched', 'struggle', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'old', 'boy', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'give', 'wrap', 'two', 'knob', 'front', 'boat', 'dally', 'style', 'rather', 'watching', 'skin', 'disappear', 'hands', 'fury', 'fish', 'fight', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'script.The', 'final', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'Old', 'Man', 'village', 'battle', 'sea', 'fin', 'are', 'almost', 'everyone', 'can', 'identify', 'time', 'own', 'life', 'drama']",N/A

Now I am watching all the movies of those novels and plan to review all of them. The Old Man and the Sea is the second Hemingway film I have watched. Hemingway was and is famous in Cuba, This movie starring Spencer Tracy as an old fisherman was filmed in Cuba. Now that I'm older I can identify with this film which features the old man, a young man,  a marlin and a bird that lands on his boat. What could be simpler? The film is beautifully photographed on the Caribbean Sea off of Cuba.",5,This Movie Filmed in 1958 Won Nine Academy Award Nominations.,1383696000,"11 6, 2013",2013,567,"['read', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'novels', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'student', 'years', 'ago', 'Now', 'am', 'watching', 'movies', 'novels', 'plan', 'review', 'Old', 'Man', 'Sea', 'second', 'Hemingway', 'film', 'have', 'watched', 'Hemingway', 'was', 'famous', 'Cuba', 'movie', 'starring', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'old', 'fisherman', 'was', 'filmed', 'Cuba', 'Now', ""'m"", 'older', 'can', 'identify', 'film', 'old', 'man', 'young', 'man', 'marlin', 'bird', 'boat', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'simpler', 'film', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'Caribbean', 'Sea', 'Cuba']",N/A
