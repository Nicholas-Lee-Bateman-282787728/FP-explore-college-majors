196703,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300147355,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Of all the films to expose the average man's view of relationships, and the manipulated understanding of just what it means to engage in said relationships, `Carnal Knowledge' is certainly one of the best.  From the very first conversation to the final haunting frame, this film is so honest in it's brutality that one cannot help but be repulsed by the very aspects of this film that make it so engrossing.Can you see yourself?The film revolves around two friends, Sandy and Jonathan, as they filter through relationship after relationship in order to find satisfaction with the fairer gender.  From college through to adulthood, these two men approach their relationships with the same tenacity yet a different emotional makeup leaves them with drastically different outcomes.  Sandy is the softer of the two, the one who is easily manipulated by Jonathan's views and ideals, but his tenderness sets him apart, despite his desire to be more like Jonathan.  Jonathan is really the heart of the film, for he epitomizes all that is wrong with the self-destructive pattern set out by many young men today.  His desire to attain everything `fleshly' leaves him empty and unable to truly connect and love another person, let alone himself.As I have decided to dedicate the better part of today to Jack Nicholson, I'm going to focus on him here, since his performance really carries this film for me.  I adore Ann-Margret here (rightfully so), but this is Nicholson's movie.  This is a perfect example of Nicholson building on the persona he created for himself early in his career, but this is one of the best uses of that persona.  While I love his work in `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' or `The Last Detail', for me this is a much richer and deeper performance.  He paints Jonathan with such blunt strokes that it would be easy to form a disgust for him, yet he layers those strokes with undeniable inner struggle, showcasing the emptiness that his character is trying so desperately to fill.  His lack of understanding in the subject of relationships (both intimate and platonic) aids in his downfall.  He doesn't know what it means to be a friend.I know someone just like him; sadly.The rest of the cast is stellar, but they do take a backseat to Nicholson for me.  Ann-Margret is astonishing as Jonathon's jilted lover Bobbie.  Her ability to convey that loss that comes from loving a man who cannot love you the right way is heartbreaking.  Art Garfunkel is surprisingly strong here.  I really loved the way his performance contrasted Nicholson's in almost every manner.  He understood how to play that coy and nave best friend role flawlessly.  I also really liked was Candice Bergen did here.  Her portrayal of Susan was sensitive, earthy and believable.As many have noted (critics and fans alike), this is one of those films that begs to be discussed and dissected.  It is the definition of controversial, but that is welcome in this case for Mike Nichols understands what he is doing here.  He has a respect for the film subject and so it never comes across as sloppy or, worse yet, trashy.  This is sincere and earnest and HONEST and that makes it one of the better films to broach the darker side of displays of love (or affection).",5,Fleshy indeed...,1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,3243,"['films', 'expose', 'average', 'man', 'view', 'relationships', 'manipulated', 'understanding', 'just', 'what', 'engage', 'said', 'relationships', 'Carnal', 'Knowledge', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'very', 'first', 'conversation', 'final', 'haunting', 'frame', 'film', 'so', 'honest', 'brutality', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'repulsed', 'very', 'film', 'make', 'so', 'engrossing.Can', 'see', 'film', 'around', 'two', 'friends', 'Sandy', 'Jonathan', 'filter', 'relationship', 'relationship', 'order', 'find', 'satisfaction', 'fairer', 'gender', 'college', 'adulthood', 'two', 'men', 'approach', 'relationships', 'same', 'tenacity', 'yet', 'different', 'emotional', 'makeup', 'drastically', 'different', 'outcomes', 'Sandy', 'softer', 'two', 'one', 'who', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'Jonathan', 'views', 'ideals', 'tenderness', 'sets', 'apart', 'desire', 'be', 'more', 'Jonathan', 'Jonathan', 'really', 'heart', 'film', 'wrong', 'self-destructive', 'pattern', 'set', 'out', 'many', 'young', 'men', 'today', 'desire', 'attain', 'everything', 'fleshly', 'empty', 'unable', 'truly', 'connect', 'love', 'person', 'let', 'alone', 'himself.As', 'have', 'decided', 'dedicate', 'better', 'part', 'today', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', ""'m"", 'going', 'focus', 'here', 'performance', 'really', 'film', 'adore', 'Ann-Margret', 'here', 'rightfully', 'so', 'Nicholson', 'movie', 'perfect', 'example', 'Nicholson', 'building', 'persona', 'created', 'early', 'career', 'one', 'best', 'uses', 'persona', 'love', 'work', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'Last', 'Detail', 'much', 'richer', 'deeper', 'performance', 'Jonathan', 'such', 'blunt', 'strokes', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'form', 'disgust', 'yet', 'strokes', 'undeniable', 'inner', 'struggle', 'showcasing', 'emptiness', 'character', 'trying', 'so', 'desperately', 'fill', 'lack', 'understanding', 'subject', 'relationships', 'intimate', 'platonic', 'aids', 'downfall', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'be', 'friend.I', 'know', 'someone', 'just', 'rest', 'cast', 'stellar', 'do', 'take', 'backseat', 'Nicholson', 'Ann-Margret', 'astonishing', 'Jonathon', 'jilted', 'lover', 'Bobbie', 'ability', 'convey', 'loss', 'loving', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'love', 'right', 'way', 'heartbreaking', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'here', 'really', 'loved', 'way', 'performance', 'contrasted', 'Nicholson', 'almost', 'manner', 'understood', 'how', 'play', 'coy', 'nave', 'best', 'friend', 'role', 'flawlessly', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'did', 'here', 'portrayal', 'Susan', 'was', 'sensitive', 'earthy', 'believable.As', 'many', 'have', 'noted', 'critics', 'fans', 'alike', 'one', 'films', 'begs', 'be', 'discussed', 'dissected', 'definition', 'controversial', 'welcome', 'case', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'what', 'doing', 'here', 'respect', 'film', 'subject', 'never', 'across', 'sloppy', 'worse', 'yet', 'trashy', 'sincere', 'earnest', 'HONEST', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'broach', 'darker', 'side', 'displays', 'love', 'affection']",Carnal Knowledge VHS
196704,A1534MBU6VJXYN,6300147355,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[16, 19]","One of the most controversial movies ever made, this early 1970s' masterpiece cemented the reputations of Jack Nicholson and Mike Nichols, proved that Art Garfunkel can act, gave Candice Bergen her big break, and turned Ann-Margret into a serious actress. Initially, ""Carnal Knowledge"" was greeted with mixed reactions, but over time has been considered groundbreaking in its frank portrayal of sexual relationships between two womanizing friends over a nearly 30 year period.The film starts off in college, where two friends name Jonathan (Nicholson) and Sandy (Garfunkel) are roommates who dote on sex and nothing else. When Sandy meets Susan (Bergen) at mixer, he is immediately smitten with her, as is Jonathan, who takes her under his own wing. A few years go by as we see Sandy become involved with Jennifer (Carol Kane). Finally, Jonathan falls in love with the beautiful, and, yes, busty Bobbie (Ann-Margret, who deservedly got an Oscar nomination for her role). Their relationship becomes rougher as years go by, culminating in one of Nicholson's greatest fits of rage ever, matched by Ann's emotional breakdown as she begs him to marry her. The film seems to be very crowded, but the plot unfolds so smoothly, you never get a sense of ""gosh, I wanna shut this off because I don't understand it"", since every storyline in it grabs you and never lets go.The performances in this film are perfect. Nicholson gives one of his best performances ever as Jonathan, while Ann-Margret gives what may well be her single greatest performance of her career. It was great to see these two perform together, as Nicholson is my favorite actor and Ann my favorite actress. The two play off each other so well that they make the film watchable for their chemistry alone. Garfunkel was a perfect choice to play Sandy. Everyone may know him as one half of Simon & Garfunkel, but watching him play the part, he embodies it so well you can't imagine anyone playing the role. Though she leaves the movie pretty early, Candice Bergen did a superb portrayal of Susan, and Carol Kane was great as Jennifer. Rita Moreno does not appear until the last scene, but she really does the make the most of her screen time.""Carnal Knowledge"" is a cinematic masterpiece that belongs in any dvd collectio. Do not hesitate in purchasing this movie.

196705,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6300147355,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 2/14Rate: 92/14: Mike Nichols directed Carnal Knowledge, and I like his films and consider him one of the best directors because they are fresh and filled with witty dialogues, even after many years. In short, they have stood the test of time. Although I found the introduction of Carnal Knowledge very funny, I was more disturbed in the later dialogues because they were increasingly objectionable when it came to the reduction of women to nothing more than conquests. I think the moral of the film has to be perfectly summarized during the picture show when Jonathan, played wonderfully well by Jack Nicholson, gives his final review for each women he had in his life based on how well they performed sexually. It is the point when I get what Carnal Knowledge is all about. It's simply an abyss of emptiness as the two men go farther in their destructive womanizing ways. I have to say, it's a pretty good film although I can see why it is a polemical one. For its time, Carnal Knowledge is a daring picture because it deals with objectification of women, wife swapping, brazen womanizing, and colloquial myopic view of women. All in all, Carnal Knowledge is one of Mike Nichols' best. By the way, to the question in one of Seinfeld's episode, the answer is ""no, she did not.""",5,"Daring, Polemical, and Relevant.",1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,1286,"['Viewed', '2/14Rate', '92/14', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'directed', 'Carnal', 'Knowledge', 'like', 'films', 'consider', 'one', 'best', 'directors', 'are', 'fresh', 'filled', 'witty', 'dialogues', 'even', 'many', 'years', 'short', 'have', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'found', 'introduction', 'Carnal', 'Knowledge', 'very', 'funny', 'was', 'more', 'disturbed', 'later', 'dialogues', 'were', 'increasingly', 'objectionable', 'when', 'came', 'reduction', 'women', 'nothing', 'more', 'conquests', 'think', 'moral', 'film', 'be', 'perfectly', 'summarized', 'picture', 'show', 'when', 'Jonathan', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'well', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'final', 'review', 'women', 'had', 'life', 'based', 'how', 'well', 'performed', 'sexually', 'point', 'when', 'get', 'what', 'Carnal', 'Knowledge', 'simply', 'abyss', 'emptiness', 'two', 'men', 'go', 'farther', 'destructive', 'womanizing', 'ways', 'have', 'say', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'polemical', 'one', 'time', 'Carnal', 'Knowledge', 'daring', 'picture', 'objectification', 'women', 'wife', 'swapping', 'brazen', 'womanizing', 'colloquial', 'myopic', 'view', 'women', 'Carnal', 'Knowledge', 'one', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'best', 'way', 'question', 'one', 'Seinfeld', 'episode', 'answer', 'no', 'did', 'not']",Carnal Knowledge VHS
196706,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6300147355,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[3, 4]","I don't know what to make of this movie. From the standards of 1971, it was moderately racy for a mass-market movie, but still tame compared to ""I am Curious, Yellow"" for example. There is some nudity, and one very casual frontal nude in a locker-room scene. And there are sex acts, but they are under cover, so all you really get is the grunts and the moves.Jonathan (Jack Nicholson) and Sandy (Art Garfunkel) are room-mates in college circa 1950. Since neither one impresses me as being all that sexy, it's hard to understand how Susan (Candice Bergen) falls in love with both of them. But she does. Jonathan brazenly called her up one day and she went out for a drink with him, even though he was her boyfriend's best friend. Why? Never made clear. But then a lot of things are never made clear in this movie.Time passes. Sandy marries Susan, they have a proper suburban family. Jonathan is still playing around. It's getting pretty tiresome, he admits, but he's just not into the whole marriage shtick. Fine. Sounds like a very typical man of his time (now into the sixties). Then he meets Bobbie (Ann-Margret) and they have a great time together; lots of laughs, great sex. So after awhile, she suggests they shack up together, he decides it's a good idea as long as they understand it's not marriage, and she agrees. Still later, he suggests she quit her job, and she does.Beginning to sound like half the couples you've known? Maybe even yourself? Believe me, every cliche from the fifties and sixties is in here. Funny thing is, the Supreme Court had to be the one to decide that it was not obscene: Rehnquist said, ""nudity alone is not enough to make material legally obscene."" He also said the film ""did not depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way.""No, but it managed to make it pretty darn boring, which offended me. I will give this two stars.

""Carnal Knowledge"" is his most intimate film, and one of the most daring of the 1970s. Its frankness in dealing with young men's sexual psychology has not lost its edge after thirty years. On top of it all, it gives us Nicholson's first truly great performance. The early scenes between him and Garfunkel are fresh and sincere. Spanning some three decades of their friendship, we see how their attitudes towards sex, and women in general, shape their lives. Both actors do a fine job of communicating the gravity of those years, and the most devastating scene is the one where Jack delivers a long and furious tirade at Ann-Margret. ""I don't want a job, I want you,"" she says, to which he replies, ""I'm taken...by me!"" Brutally honest, yes, but because we've seen what comes before, it's perfectly logical. These men are still affected by the innocence of their younger years, but that innocence is violently clashing with their adult understanding (or lack thereof)--the understanding that the personality is in perpetual motion, and that it becomes difficult to keep up. The movie is often bleak in its settings and its subject matter, but the characters are very real--they challenge you to challenge them. Their dysfunctions may enlighten you, and there is nothing bleak about being enlightened. Oh, and Ann-Margret achieves bombshell status with this movie, playing a woman who at first seems to be the answer to all of Nicholson's fantasies.

196714,A37O3TIQW8ZIC9,6300147355,"David Avender ""David""","[2, 3]","A surprisingly smart film on the subject of romance and sexual desire, and one featuring some of the most honest conversations on the subjects thereof. With appreciable elements of Louie Malle's ""My Dinner with Andre: The Criterion Collection"" and Whit Stillman's three interconnected works from the mid-1990s, (including ""Metropolitan: The Criterion Collection"", ""Barcelona"", and ""The Last Days of Disco: The Criterion Collection""), Mike Nichols' ""Carnal Knowledge"" is a film that seems to trust its audience; and, when released theatrically in 1971, was willing to gamble that audiences were ready to enjoy extended scenes of intimate conversation that would play in lieu of intimate action. Nichol's was right, and though the film was not a commercial success, it lives this day as a film one may view alone, or with several members from the Metropolitan Opera's production of Verdi's ""La Gazza Ladra.""Lost, forgotten, or a victim of disinterest, this film has been unfairly overlooked among the fine works of The Mike Nichols Collection for too long. And fouler the insult, ""Carnal Knowledge"" truly owns some of the finest moments of acting, short in length though they may be, that I have ever seen. These moments are sometimes quiet . . often very intimate. They consisting of frank and earnest discussions of vastly varying volumes concerning what it is that ignites the fire that so well begins a passionate relationship, and what it might be that slowly corrupts and turns this wonderful, maddening passion into cruelty and contempt.On some less fundamentally important perspectives, Ann Margaret has never looked more beautiful--in fact, the notion of feminine beauty, the rationale for copulation, has never been more explicable, than here, in this film. If you are apt to appreciate the early works of author Milan Kundera, this film will fit you rather well, and if you're a fan of Mike Nichols' earlier work, ""Carnal Knowledge"" might--might--offer some answers as to why a pair the likes of George and Martha of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" ever found one another.""Carnal Knowledge"" is a smart and sexy film, featuring an ensemble of clever people speaking with other clever people about things that matter. The film first stirs your attention, and then draw you in. With remarkable performances by Jack Nicholson, Art Garfunkel and Candice Bergen; and one transcendent performance by Ann-Margret, you come to care for these characters; you wish, for reasons various and, on occasion, unmentionable, to be part of the sensational and stirring action. This film is unlike any American films being made today; and that fact, together with its inherent greatness, makes this film so very precious, and such a joy to watch.dma.",5,A Whit Stillman Film from 1971?,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,2741,"['surprisingly', 'smart', 'film', 'subject', 'romance', 'sexual', 'desire', 'one', 'featuring', 'most', 'honest', 'conversations', 'subjects', 'thereof', 'appreciable', 'elements', 'Louie', 'Malle', 'Dinner', 'Andre', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Whit', 'Stillman', 'three', 'interconnected', 'works', 'mid-1990s', 'including', 'Metropolitan', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Barcelona', 'Last', 'Days', 'Disco', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'Carnal', 'Knowledge', 'film', 'trust', 'audience', 'when', 'released', 'theatrically', '1971', 'was', 'willing', 'gamble', 'audiences', 'were', 'ready', 'enjoy', 'extended', 'scenes', 'intimate', 'conversation', 'would', 'play', 'lieu', 'intimate', 'action', 'Nichol', 'was', 'right', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'commercial', 'success', 'day', 'film', 'one', 'may', 'view', 'alone', 'several', 'members', 'Metropolitan', 'Opera', 'production', 'Verdi', 'La', 'Gazza', 'Ladra', 'Lost', 'forgotten', 'victim', 'disinterest', 'film', 'been', 'unfairly', 'overlooked', 'fine', 'works', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'Collection', 'too', 'long', 'fouler', 'insult', 'Carnal', 'Knowledge', 'truly', 'finest', 'moments', 'acting', 'short', 'may', 'be', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'moments', 'are', 'sometimes', 'quiet', 'often', 'very', 'intimate', 'consisting', 'frank', 'earnest', 'discussions', 'vastly', 'varying', 'volumes', 'concerning', 'what', 'fire', 'so', 'well', 'passionate', 'relationship', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'slowly', 'corrupts', 'wonderful', 'maddening', 'passion', 'cruelty', 'contempt.On', 'less', 'fundamentally', 'important', 'perspectives', 'Ann', 'Margaret', 'never', 'looked', 'more', 'beautiful', 'fact', 'notion', 'feminine', 'beauty', 'rationale', 'copulation', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'explicable', 'here', 'film', 'are', 'apt', 'appreciate', 'early', 'works', 'author', 'Milan', 'Kundera', 'film', 'will', 'fit', 'rather', 'well', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'earlier', 'work', 'Carnal', 'Knowledge', 'might', 'might', 'offer', 'answers', 'why', 'pair', 'likes', 'George', 'Martha', 'Who', 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'ever', 'found', 'one', 'Carnal', 'Knowledge', 'smart', 'sexy', 'film', 'featuring', 'ensemble', 'clever', 'people', 'speaking', 'other', 'clever', 'people', 'things', 'matter', 'film', 'first', 'attention', 'then', 'draw', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'one', 'transcendent', 'performance', 'Ann-Margret', 'come', 'care', 'characters', 'wish', 'reasons', 'various', 'occasion', 'unmentionable', 'be', 'part', 'sensational', 'stirring', 'action', 'film', 'American', 'films', 'being', 'made', 'today', 'fact', 'together', 'inherent', 'greatness', 'film', 'so', 'very', 'precious', 'joy', 'watch.dma']",Carnal Knowledge VHS
196715,A2OVUDBRWGX0LL,6300147355,David,"[3, 4]","This movie struck a chord with me, having dealt with some very similar people during my lifetime.  Events depicted in the film aren't as relevant as the personalities behind the events.  Nicholson's character is most certainly a sociopath--shallow, manipulative, vain, and unable express genuine emotions or empathize with the pain he inflicts upon others.  He desires the 'perfect' woman, a (preferably) buxom woman who can give him great sex and then turn into a little china doll to be placed on a shelf until she's needed again.  It's that simple.  He eventually finds 'happiness' in the form of Rita Moreno--a woman who is willing to act out Nicholson's fantasies with him, right down to speaking a very precisely planned dialogue.Ann-Margret's character is a tragic figure.  Having been used all of her life as a sex toy, she ""shacks up"" with Nicholson in the hope of finding true love.  But her personality isn't nearly strong enough to reform him.  She fears being alone and unloved above all else and is willing to repeatedly swallow her pride while taking abuse in the hope that everything will somehow turn out all right.  She is a classic example of a kept woman who ends up losing her soul.  She is willing to share everything with men who will never share anything of themselves with her.Candice Bergen, despite her second billing, has a relatively small role as an innocent woman (unlike Ann-Margret) who succumbs to Nicholson's charms despite being involved with his 'best friend.'  She is an example of women who go for the bad guy, the rebel, the wolf, in their youth before settling down with a good guy as they mature.Garfunkel's character is something of a paradox.  He's a nice guy who envies Nicholson's bad boy ways and conquests.  As a result, he, too, finds himself straying in an attempt to find his niche.Rounding out the major players is Cynthia O'Neal, in the role of Garfunkel's one-time girfriend Cindy.  She is as strong as Nicholson, something that intrigues and attracts him greatly.  Still, in the end, he must know that it would be the equivalent of mixing fire and gasoline.  But that doesn't stop him from trying to play with fire.Overall, a very enlightening character study.",4,Fine Study in Failed Personalities,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,2215,"['movie', 'struck', 'chord', 'having', 'dealt', 'very', 'similar', 'people', 'lifetime', 'Events', 'depicted', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'relevant', 'personalities', 'events', 'Nicholson', 'character', 'most', 'certainly', 'sociopath', 'shallow', 'manipulative', 'vain', 'unable', 'express', 'genuine', 'emotions', 'empathize', 'pain', 'others', ""'perfect"", 'woman', 'preferably', 'buxom', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'give', 'great', 'sex', 'then', 'turn', 'little', 'china', 'doll', 'be', 'placed', 'shelf', 'needed', 'again', 'simple', 'eventually', ""'happiness"", 'form', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'woman', 'who', 'willing', 'act', 'out', 'Nicholson', 'fantasies', 'right', 'down', 'speaking', 'very', 'precisely', 'planned', 'dialogue.Ann-Margret', 'character', 'tragic', 'figure', 'Having', 'been', 'used', 'life', 'sex', 'toy', 'up', 'Nicholson', 'hope', 'finding', 'true', 'love', 'personality', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'strong', 'enough', 'reform', 'being', 'alone', 'unloved', 'else', 'willing', 'repeatedly', 'swallow', 'pride', 'taking', 'abuse', 'hope', 'everything', 'will', 'somehow', 'turn', 'out', 'right', 'classic', 'example', 'kept', 'woman', 'who', 'up', 'losing', 'soul', 'willing', 'share', 'everything', 'men', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'share', 'anything', 'her.Candice', 'Bergen', 'second', 'billing', 'relatively', 'small', 'role', 'innocent', 'woman', 'Ann-Margret', 'who', 'succumbs', 'Nicholson', 'charms', 'being', 'involved', ""'best"", 'friend', 'example', 'women', 'who', 'go', 'bad', 'guy', 'rebel', 'wolf', 'youth', 'settling', 'down', 'good', 'guy', 'mature.Garfunkel', 'character', 'something', 'paradox', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'Nicholson', 'bad', 'boy', 'ways', 'conquests', 'result', 'too', 'straying', 'attempt', 'find', 'niche.Rounding', 'out', 'major', 'players', 'Cynthia', ""O'Neal"", 'role', 'Garfunkel', 'one-time', 'girfriend', 'Cindy', 'as', 'strong', 'Nicholson', 'something', 'intrigues', 'greatly', 'Still', 'end', 'must', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'equivalent', 'mixing', 'fire', 'gasoline', ""n't"", 'stop', 'trying', 'play', 'fire.Overall', 'very', 'enlightening', 'character', 'study']",Carnal Knowledge VHS

Which is: Very well done, Very mature, extremely confident in it's telling, thought provoking, well acted, well written, etc.Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkle star as best buds in this story that follows their sexual encounters from college to middle age. That's really it. No other action takes place in this movie that doesn't have something to do with, yup, Carnal Knowledge. Good title too. Don't you think? Just grabs you.Like Catch 22, which I just saw, this movie is all about great framing and long one takes. Even though this movie takes place almost completely inside and is very much like a play, it is very cinematic. Nichols always has the camera in the right place, or at least an interesting place. The structure of the film is also so interesting. It just pops around from sexaul encounter to sexual encounter. And it addresses the whole spectrum...: first love, to marriage, to adultery, to apathy, to..well, it covers a lot. And though it tends to focus mainly on the negative, which can be a little bleak, it sure is real.At times it can be a little slow and a little tedious (you sort of feel Nichols getting a little TOO into some of these long takes), but this remains a very good, intelligent, unflinching movie.

When Art falls in love with Candice Bergen (she plays a virgin) it starts as a good friendship until Jack Nicholson buds in.  He secretly makes a phone call to her without Art knowing.  Jack dates Candice and she loses her virginity by the macho man who can get any woman he wants anywhere, anyway.  (So why, Candice?)

196723,ABX7SEE84DMLU,6300147355,John P Bernat,"[2, 5]","When this movie first came out, a contemporary labelled it a movie about two guys who confused liking women (...).  That was true.But oh, it's so much more.  Nicholson delivers one of his best, if less well-recognized, angry outbursts.  He's so good at rage-a-holism that you cannot help but admire him.  More than that, though, he shows the terrible emptiness of a man who only knows relationships as transactions and who believes that to give of yourself risks not getting as much back - and that the only people who do that are chumps.Art Garfunkel's character - and his performance - are way too easily eclipsed by Nicholson's.  But it offers so much:  he is a doctor who's self-absorption is so extreme that you wonder how he could manage the spiritual demands of medical practice.  And he lusts for Candace Bergen, a woman portrayed as either frigid or just non-responsive because she's preoccupied by her feelings for Jack.So, you have a pretty volatile mix:  lust, sex, betrayal, high levels of emotions such as anger...Told in a clinical cinematic style which is amazingly apt, given its sharp contrast.  Much of the story is told via static, unmoving head shots.  For most of the movie, even non-head shots are done with a mounted, fixed camera.  People leave the frame, are away for a while, and then come back into frame.The ""boring"" camera underscores how Mike Nichols wants us to see his characters:  in a dispassionate way, as though we were observing an ant colony with detached irony.  God, it's a good thing that these awful, bankrupt people are nothing like WE are...Of course.And then there's the last sequence.  Rita Moreno demonstrates acting life after being Maria's best friend in West Side Story...playing a prostitute, she executes a script written by Jack Nicholson which Jack now requires, to the letter, in order for Jack to reach climax.  ""It's in the air,"" she says, with an indescribable facial expression of professional satisfaction and delight, as though the world can now go on because Jack, in a pre-Viagra day, can achieve an erection.Thank God we're so much better now...we have Viagra.Watch this movie.

Let's just go for the sex in a  relationship, and that will be great.  We all know its not.  This is what  we see in Carnal Knowledge.  Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel are roommates  in college, and are trying to experience the rite of passage : sex for the  first time.  Garfunkel goes for Candice Bergen, who he never scores with.  Throughout the whole time, though, Nicholson sneakly does with Bergen.  He  really is a ba----- to do that to a friend.  Bergen appears as a good woman  at the beginning, but she really isn't is she after sneakly going with  Nicholson while being with Garfunkel.  But the story gets even more  powerful when they are out of college and Nicholson finds Ann-Margret,  &quot;Bobby&quot;.  He goes for her, because of her body, and they're in  bed the first night they meet.  That's trouble right there, since that's  how many live in today's society, having one-night stands.  Nicholson and  Margret live with each other, and eventually get married.  Later, we here  Nicholson say when he's showing a slide of Margret, &quot;That's Bobby, who  conned me into marrying her.&quot;  He later went to say he now pays here  alamony.  He should have thought about that before a one-night stand.  Art  Garfunkel marries Bergen, and by the end of the fim when there older, we  see a third partner he has who is young, played by Carol Kane.  Throughout  the film, when director Mike Nichols is switching through different times  in the men's lives, we see a ballerina type figure turning around on the  ice.  It represents what Nicholson and Garfunkel were doing the whole time  we got to know them, playing on &quot;ice&quot;, with woman they met.  All  the performances are superb, and particularly, you'll never forget  Nicholson, and even Ann-Margret who sounds like a whore with a heart of  gold, but really isn't.

196725,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6300147355,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 8]","Carnal Knowledge, when released in 1971, was very controversial and was one of the first films to be about sex. There had been movies before it with sexual content, but not a movie that was about sex and what we do for it.Although looking at it now, this film can't hold a candle to other sexual films around nowadays and it's a bit dated with the times but it's still a ground-breaking piece of filmmaking and it's a really good movie. It's not for everyone though, not just because of the subject matter, but because it's about people and conversations. The film isn't dialogue, event, dialogue, event, dialogue, big event. The film is instead; setting, dialogue, setting, dialogue, nudity, dialogue...It plays almost like a play, rather than a movie but it somehow works. Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel play two college roommates named Jonathan and Sandy. When we meet the two men, they're both virgins and talk graphicly about what they desire in a woman. About the same time, at a party, Sandy meets a woman named Susan (Candice Bergen) and falls for her. But, Jonathan begins dating her simultaneously (hiding it from Sandy) and ends up losing his virginity to Susan before Sandy does. Jonanthan, out of guilt, hastily breaks up with Susan and Sandy stays with her. Jonathan never tells Sandy what happened. Instead, the story moves on with Jonathan falling for a woman named Bobbie (Ann-Margret, who was really hot). Sandy doesn't disappear, but his character is downgraded from here. The movie is 98 minutes and Sandy is probably in it a little over 30 minutes. Anyway, that's all I can really say about the plot without telling you everything. All the actors are spectacular, but as usual it's Nicholson who gives the best performance. There are scenes in the film where the camera will hold on an actor for a long period of time and have the actor recite a long monologue. Everytime this happens with Nicholson, he knocks it out of the park. Anyway, this is an innovative and highly interesting film; As I said, it's not for everybody...But it's definitely worth checking out.GRADE: A",5,Very Intresting,1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,2096,"['Carnal', 'Knowledge', 'when', 'released', '1971', 'was', 'very', 'controversial', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'be', 'sex', 'had', 'been', 'movies', 'sexual', 'content', 'not', 'movie', 'was', 'sex', 'what', 'do', 'it.Although', 'looking', 'now', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'other', 'sexual', 'films', 'nowadays', 'bit', 'dated', 'times', 'still', 'ground-breaking', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'though', 'not', 'just', 'subject', 'matter', 'people', 'conversations', 'film', ""n't"", 'dialogue', 'event', 'dialogue', 'event', 'dialogue', 'big', 'event', 'film', 'instead', 'setting', 'dialogue', 'setting', 'dialogue', 'nudity', 'dialogue', 'almost', 'play', 'rather', 'movie', 'somehow', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'play', 'two', 'college', 'roommates', 'named', 'Jonathan', 'Sandy', 'When', 'meet', 'two', 'men', ""'re"", 'virgins', 'talk', 'graphicly', 'what', 'desire', 'woman', 'same', 'time', 'party', 'Sandy', 'woman', 'named', 'Susan', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'Jonathan', 'dating', 'simultaneously', 'hiding', 'Sandy', 'up', 'losing', 'virginity', 'Susan', 'Sandy', 'Jonanthan', 'guilt', 'hastily', 'up', 'Susan', 'Sandy', 'Jonathan', 'never', 'Sandy', 'what', 'happened', 'Instead', 'story', 'moves', 'Jonathan', 'falling', 'woman', 'named', 'Bobbie', 'Ann-Margret', 'who', 'was', 'really', 'hot', 'Sandy', ""n't"", 'disappear', 'character', 'downgraded', 'here', 'movie', '98', 'minutes', 'Sandy', 'probably', 'little', '30', 'minutes', 'Anyway', 'can', 'really', 'say', 'plot', 'telling', 'everything', 'actors', 'are', 'spectacular', 'usual', 'Nicholson', 'who', 'best', 'performance', 'are', 'scenes', 'film', 'where', 'camera', 'will', 'hold', 'actor', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'have', 'actor', 'recite', 'long', 'monologue', 'Everytime', 'Nicholson', 'park', 'Anyway', 'innovative', 'highly', 'interesting', 'film', 'said', 'not', 'everybody', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out.GRADE']",Carnal Knowledge VHS
196726,A2Q0A0V1FQL9MZ,6300147355,Kevin T,"[5, 7]","This movie was one of the first movies to really push the envelope when it came to sex and relationships.  The movie explored the relationship between two college buddies as they started out their single lives just trying to get laid.  As time went on, one of them decided to get married and experience the &quot;typical&quot; life(Art Garfunkel), while the other one went about just trying to get laid(Jack Nicholson).  The idea of &quot;looks are everything&quot; was portraied by Jack Nicholson, who just wanted a girl that was well-endowed.  Art Garfunkel on the other hand was more sensitive to what a woman wanted, but still did not fully understand what love is.  Both characters had very different ideas on what they wanted in a woman, but both were unable to appreciate what they had, and often went looking elsewhere.  One of the most important lines in the movie comes in the opening credits where the two debate if it is better to love and not be loved back, or to be loved and not love them.  This is the theme the director uses to define the movie.  Nicholson is loved, but has no love to give.  Garfunkel loves, but is not loved back.  It is interesting to watch their lives play out as they grow older, but seems to be missing something that would make it a classic.  I think this could be helped with a better ending, more closure to their lives.B+",4,Good Trend-setting Movie,986083200,"04 1, 2001",2001,1365,"['movie', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'movies', 'really', 'push', 'envelope', 'when', 'came', 'sex', 'relationships', 'movie', 'explored', 'relationship', 'two', 'college', 'buddies', 'started', 'out', 'single', 'lives', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'laid', 'time', 'went', 'one', 'decided', 'get', 'married', 'experience', 'quot', 'typical', 'quot', 'life', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'other', 'one', 'went', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'laid', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'idea', 'quot', 'looks', 'are', 'everything', 'quot', 'was', 'portraied', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'who', 'just', 'wanted', 'girl', 'was', 'well-endowed', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'more', 'sensitive', 'what', 'woman', 'wanted', 'still', 'did', 'not', 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'love', 'characters', 'had', 'very', 'different', 'ideas', 'what', 'wanted', 'woman', 'were', 'unable', 'appreciate', 'what', 'had', 'often', 'went', 'looking', 'elsewhere', 'One', 'most', 'important', 'lines', 'movie', 'opening', 'credits', 'where', 'two', 'debate', 'better', 'love', 'not', 'be', 'loved', 'back', 'be', 'loved', 'not', 'love', 'theme', 'director', 'define', 'movie', 'Nicholson', 'loved', 'love', 'give', 'Garfunkel', 'not', 'loved', 'back', 'interesting', 'watch', 'lives', 'play', 'out', 'grow', 'older', 'be', 'missing', 'something', 'would', 'make', 'classic', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'helped', 'better', 'ending', 'more', 'closure', 'lives.B+']",Carnal Knowledge VHS

It stars Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel and begins in their college days.  It seems the only thing they talk about is women and sex and there a touch of humor in their quest for their first intimate experience.There's a comic quality to their early liaisons they both have with Candice Bergen but they are still very young. Fast forward a few years and Nicholson is now romancing Ann Margaret.  Their relationship is based on their mutual attraction and is doomed from the beginning.  Eventually Ann Margaret stops working and does nothing but sleep.  Garfunkel is having his own problems with his wife.  The two men commiserate but neither of them see how they are sabotaging their own interests by their objectifying the women in their lives.The film moved slowly and many of the shots were filmed against a stark background in an attempt to be arty.  There were lots of close up shots of sorrowful faces.  The acting was good, of course and I especially liked the role of Rita Moreno who appears only in one dynamic scene which sums up the relations that Jack Nicholson has with his women.Even though the film was intense and well acted, I just plain didn't like it.

It's not a pretty picture, and despite the titillation of the title, it's not even particularly sexy.
