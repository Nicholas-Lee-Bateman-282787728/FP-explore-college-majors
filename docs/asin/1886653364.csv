195321,A3M6PVBDT2ED45,1886653364,"Emily Braun ""hmouse101""","[5, 74]","I bought this DVD because I am an astronomy buff. What I got was one astronmers narrow viewpoint that didn't even sit well with biblical literests. If this guy is a true scientest why is he using words like ""impossible"" when its comes to the possibility that life may have developed elsewhere in the Universe. The fact is what astronmers are discovering more and more is that the Universe is much more dynamic than we ever could have imagined. I beleive in God but why would he create one vast Universe just for one civilization. In the Bible, when God made the world, the only thing he said wasn't good was the fact that Adam was alone. So why would he create a whole Universe in which we are alone?Bad Science, Bad Religion. Nobody wins here.

195322,AHMU3FMKH0RM,1886653364,J. Mccormack,"[13, 35]","It takes WAY more faith to believe this hogwash than it does to believe the Bible. True, he does tie it in at the end and makes a case that all of these supposed coincidences that made everything happen ""just right"" for life, most likely were because God was behind it; yet he contradicts such a view by the rest of the trashy ""science"" throughout.Look, plain and simple...if you are going to acknowledge a God is involved at all, then you should have absolutely NO issue with believing that this same God created things as he said, with a supposed ""history"" behind them already. There are plenty of other scientific sources and explanations out there for the time and travel speed of light, etc. so that is not even a factor.This video makes it seem that while God could direct things along a perfect path for life, that He still somehow needed to sit around and wait for things to scientifically progress for billions of years till they are adequate for His purpose. Yeah...right!Other reviewers bring up the issue with the Hebrew world Yom meaning a period of time...fine, how is that an issue. God plainly says day (yom - a period of time) and then clearly qualifies more specifically and without question, just what that period of time was - an evening and morning. How much clearer does He need to be? If He wanted to be more clear, what words should he have used to be convincing? Science tells us we have 24 hour days, which include a morning and evening due to the our rotation, etc. So, God, in relating to man (some two thousand years after creation) how it was done, used plain language that Moses, in his day and time, would understand. In Moses' day, a morning and evening day was 24 hours as it is today. If God wanted to say it took millions of years, then why would he tell Moses is took a single morning and evening day? Did he think Moses would actually already understand that to mean billions of years? Was he just being deceptive to man on purpose?If a day means long periods of time, thousands of years, then we have other problems. The morning and evenings of old were separated by all o these years. Does that mean they have been readily declining all these years, to where now they are separated by simply 24 hours? Will they continue to compress, to where days becomes less hours?If a creation day is multiple years, then what does that do to Adam's age? He was created on the sixth ""day"" which was followed by a seventh ""day."" So if a day was, say, a thousand years...Adam was a freaking old dude before he even enjoyed a day of rest. It also means he died before experiencing that day of rest, because we are told he lived less than 1000 years. I can't believe anyone could swallow the load of trash this type of theory presents. Science is not the answer to all things, since science can only reveal what God has left for it to reveal. If God created the Earth with an already establish appearance of a billion years, then science will always be screwed up since they are starting from the wrong position.Couldn't God have put things in their place, with an already established ""history"" appearance (i.e. light already present and not taking millions of light years to reach us, etc.)? How do we know God didn't create the Earth with levels of levels of fossils built in, just to screw with the mind of people too blind to believe in him? If we believe in God, as he seems to state on this DVD, then why is it so hard to believe God created things exactly as they were, in a short amount of time? Is God restricted by the laws of science that He himself established?Which came first...Did God first create man, then realized what kid of planet it would take to sustain his life, and then set the ball in motion to eventually have such a planet come about billions of years later? Or did He create the Earth as it is, then form man in a manner in which he could live there? And if God created humans to live on the Earth as it was created, how hard is it to fathom he could just as easily create life that could easily live on Mars, Jupiter, etc (not that I am saying there is life on other planets)? Why do we feel that man could only be created a certain way, and that THEN God had to create a planet for him to live on? All of this silly theory is just mind boggling how a supposed smart scientist would be so ignorant.Almost every bit of information on this DVD is pure speculation and fairy tail. No one was there, none of it can be proven, it is all just a story designed to fit into a presupposition that scientists have in their mind, and they hope some foolish people will believe them.This video was a joke...the supposed science contained on it is a joke...and Hugh Ross' Christian profession is questionably a joke if he follows this ridiculous line of thought.",1,What a complete

Butera,"[32, 40]","This DVD takes one on a journey through time and space and does a remarkable job of showing the uniqueness of planet earth and the complete improbability of life being anywhere else in the universe. Extremely informative and great graphics showing and describing nebulas, galaxies and even the universe before matter.I higly recommend this DVD. It does not fit into the 6-24hour days of creation but rather uses the 6 long periods of time. Some may find this offense. Personally, this is not a problem for me as it is the uniqueness of earth and all that it absolutely needed to have life on earth that boggles my mind.Two other points that make this DVD special is the scientific evidence that shows how the universe is expanding at a faster rate after it slowed down first and the importance of our moon. The term fine tuning of the universe is used and mathmatical improbabilities are used to prove the universe is continually being fine tuned to support life on earth.To sum it up Dr. Hugh Ross takes you on a wild intellectual and beautiful ride through the universe and back in time to the beginning of it all.
