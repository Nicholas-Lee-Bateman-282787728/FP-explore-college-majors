1546909,A13UPPKNU1BO13,B0085Z3BLW,A. Irey,"[2, 2]","For the first time in the history of the UFC a main event card consisted entirely of heavyweight bouts.  Having heard this months ago I was a bit weary as heavyweights tend to have matches that if having gone the distance to a judges decision gradually lose their energy and can be pretty boring.  Given the opposite end each fight could end in devastating fashion via the typical kind of knockout power that is so prevalent within the heavyweight class.  Luckily for fans each fight was relatively short and exciting with what I would deem a pretty incredible success given how it could have ended.In the first fight of the night is Stefan Struve taking on Lavar Johnson.  Standing at 6 foot and 11 inches Struve is the tallest fighter in the UFC roster.  Being so tall he doesn't resemble the typical heavyweight fighter as he appears more like a middleweight but it's pretty evident how deserved of his size how he should be a heavyweight when he's placed next to his opponent (Just look at the stare-down between Struve and Pat Barry to prove my point).  Struve has proved to be the uncommon Jiu-Jitsu specialist and has ended a number of his fights by submission.  Also worth mentioning is the fact that only one of his fights has ever gone the distance in his 29 career bouts.  Johnson, like Struve, also has a pension for ending his fights early with his own career never having seen the judges card.  He's a rather dangerous striker having earned two knockout of the nights since entering the UFC.  While I won't say it was a battle of styles, as Struve is perfectly content with striking on the standup, this fight ends early with one fighter's strength catching an early finish to start the evening with a resounding tempo that would set the pace for the night.Up to this point both Stipe Miocic and Shane del Rosario weren't very well known but both had kept undefeated records and when two undefeated fighters come face to face I think the fight always plays out more interesting than not.  Miocic is a wrestler with a striking style for boxing and has utilized both within his UFC career, having successfully controlled his debut match as well as earning Knockout of the Night honors in his last fight.  Del Rosario is a muay thai striker entering the UFC with a record that boasts finishes that have all occurred within the first two rounds of any of his fights.  This fight didn't start off with the same kind of bang the last fight did but once each fighter found their groove things started getting interesting.  It's in the second round that someone finally gets a clear cut advantage before finishing the other with some really nasty ground and pound.Roy Nelson is best known as having won the tenth season of The Ultimate Fighter.  Since then he's had a run of good and bad luck.  From the point in which he won The Ultimate Fighter he went on to win his next fight by KO within the first round.  It was looking like he would enter the upper echelon of fighters in the heavyweight division until he fought against current champ Junior dos Santos.  From there he's only won a single fight of his last three, losing the likes of Frank Mir and Fabricio Werdum, so this next fight would hold some very interesting questions in regards to his future within the UFC.  Nelson's opponent, Dave Herman, was in a similar situation.  He's built a lot like a light heavyweight in the way he looks and moves but still contains the power of a heavyweight fighter.  He won his debut match and earned a fight of the night in the process before fighting Stefan Struve and getting stopped from building any momentum.  So with a run in the UFC already split down the middle so short after his debut he was looking to prove himself in a big way.  The fight itself is short and by short I mean this is literally the fastest fight on the entire main card lasting little under a minute.  The best way I can put it is think of the ""one-punch-can-end-it-at-any-time"" philosophy.  The ending really doesn't have much of a buildup and when it hits, boy does it hit hard and fast.  Easily one of my favorite knockouts in quite some time.Antonio Silva is a heavyweight who was previously fighting in the Strikeforce organization.  Silva is a decent striker with notable power and nasty ground and pound while also holding a black belt in Jiu-Jitsu.  He also holds notable victories over Andrei Arlovski and Fedor Emelianenko.  He was looking to make a big name for himself in his debut in the UFC and what better way to do that than by taking on former champion Cain Velasquez.  Velasquez became champion after dethroning Brock Lesnar in arguably the biggest match of 2010.  He was undefeated and looked damn near unstoppable but was sidelined by a shoulder injury which kept him out of competition for little over a year.  When he returned he was once again in one of the most pivotal matches of the year but unfortunately for him the results were very different.  Junior dos Santos claimed the throne of top dog in the heavyweight division with one right hand and so ended the reign of Velasquez.  With this being the first fight for Velasquez since losing his title he was looking to make claim to number one contendership with an impressive performance.  It's really unfortunate for the loser of this fight because he certainly didn't have much in the way of showing for himself the kind of strengths he has because the victor pretty much took it away from him.  This starts off fast and within seconds of the first round there is an absolute blitz of strikes thrown until blood was literally pouring everywhere.  Fans can best compare the fight between BJ Penn and Joe Stevenson where a one-sided beating created one of the most visual bloodbaths in the history of the UFC.  This was the same thing.  The victor looked downright scary by taking his opponent and not giving him a second to shine on almost any level beyond surviving for as long as he did.  This is the fight that came across to me as the biggest message of the evening.In the main event Junior dos Santos looked to defend his title against Frank Mir.  Dos Santos has looked pretty unstoppable in his UFC career.  Having yet to loss once in his UFC run he has thrown big name after big name down and with devastating fashion by showcasing what is arguably the best boxing in the heavyweight division.  His latest victim earned him the heavyweight title and now he was looking to claim the honor of being a considered a ""true"" champion by defending his title.  Originally it was supposed to be Alistair Overeem but Overeem failed his drug test following his victory over Brock Lesnar last December and was unable to secure a proper license to complete so Frank Mir was pulled from his original fight with Cain Velasquez and given a shot at dos Santos' title.  Mir is himself an extremely decorated heavyweight.  He's a two time champion and also holds the distinction of holding the most victories of any heavyweight with a UFC career.  His most notable skill is his absolutely destructive Jiu-Jitsu skills which was shown in pretty vividly in his submission of Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira where Mir broke Nogueira's right humerus.  While Mir has demonstrated some very impressive striking it was agreed by most that Mir's striking wouldn't be able to compete with dos Santos' so most people assumed this would be a battle of styles with Mir attempting to take this fight to the ground and dos Santos keeping the fight on the feet.  What occurred was kind of how it was thought it would play out.  With two different game plans each being played out it eventually came down to who could put his best to use and the answer came pretty quickly following the first minute of the opening round.  What followed was something closer to someone being toyed with as opposed to a fight.  Thankfully this ends in the second round before two much damage is done.  While I remain a fan of both fighters I was relieved to see this fight come to an end when it did.It's kinda funny that the one fight that didn't exactly live up to the rest of the card was the main event itself I still consider this event an incredible success.  Like I said before, given an all heavyweight card this could have gone in all kinds of wrong ways but all the matches on the main card played out well.  In what may possibly be the quickest main event I can recall there were a number of prelims shown throughout the live broadcast, many of which were very impressive as well filled with some devastating knockouts and finishes.  So far, while it may not have the all around kind of classic that was seen between Edgar/Henderson on UFC 144 this card definitely delivered.",5,UFC 146...,1339286400,"06 10,

1546910,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B0085Z3BLW,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","UFC 146This was a very historical event as it was the first all Heavyweight main card with the title on the line in the main event. This turned out to be one of the best events that the UFC has put on and that includes the undercard. This whole card was very good and would see almost all the fights finished.Spoilers1.STEFAN STRUVE VS LAVAR JOHNSON-the first fight on the all Heavyweight main card pitted a big knockout artist against a tall Jiu-Jitsu guy. Struve was set to face one of my all time favorites Mark Hunt here but Hunt got injured and was replaced by big heavy hitter Johnson. At the onset Johnson rushes in and lands a huge body shot but then goes into the clinch. From there Struve grabs an arm and pulls guard and soon after sinks in a nasty armbar getting the win. This was a great opening main card contest.2.STIPE MIOCIC VS SHANE DEL ROSARIO-first and foremost I have to say R.I.P. to Shane as he died in late 2013. The first round here was great as Del Rosario landed some nasty kicks to the body and legs as well as some good shots with his hands. Stipe still lands his hands go and even scores a takedown at the end of the round. The second round was all Miocic as he got Shane down and then worked his ground and pound until he got the TKO victory.3.ROY NELSON VS DAVE HERMAN-this fight lasts a little shy of a minute as they feel each other out for a bit and then Roy lands one big punch. Herman goes down and Roy is pulled off after landing one more shot. This was the fight I was looking forward to most since I am a big fan of Big Country.4.CAIN VELASQUEZ VS ANTONIO SILVA-this was Bigfoot&#8217;s first fight in the UFC and Cain&#8217;s first fight after losing the Heavyweight title to JDS. Things hit the floor early as Cain catches a kick from Silva and just commences to demolishing him. Cain cuts Silva open badly and continues to pound on him until the fight is stopped because of the cut and punishment Silva was taking. The fight was even stopped and restarted at one point but Cain was too much for Silva. This was a very dominate win by Cain that set up his rematch with JDS.5.JUINOR DOS SANTOS VS FRANK MIR-this was another fight I was looking forward to as I like both guys but I was wondering which Mir was showing up. Sometimes Mir looks unstoppable and other times he looks like he is very out of shape with his timing off. This fight was supposed to be JDS defending against Alistair Overeem after his big win over Brock Lesnar but he was popped for drugs and was cut from the card. So Mir drops out of the fight he was scheduled for and gets another shot at the title. The first round starts with Mir diving for the leg but JDS shakes him off. From there the round is spent with both guys trading mostly with JDS the clear better striker. Towards the end of the round Mir gets rocked and JDS swarms him but he stays alive and makes the bell. In the second round JDS just continues to let his ands go picking his shots. Twice in this round Mir gets dropped but it would the final time he gets dropped that JDS gets the win after it is clear that Mir does not know where he is.On disc one you get the countdown show as a bonus feature.DISC 21.MIKE BROWN VS DANIEL PINEDA-the first fight of the night started out well with both guys feeling each other out and trading. Brown would secure a takedown and try to work from there but Pineda would reverse it and end up on top. The round closes with Brown on top once again after getting another takedown. The second round was excellent as Brown got more takedowns including a slam but Pineda fought back and even swept Brown. There were some good shots landed by both but Brown ends up on top to close the round again landing some big shots. The final round is mostly Brown after he hurts Pineda with a knee to the body securing the UD victory.2.GLOVER TEXEIRA VS KYLE KINGSBURY-this fight did not last long as Glover just let loose on Kyle. He gets Kyle on the ground after landing a big uppercut. From there he works his ground and pound until sinking in the arm-triangle. This was an impressive showing from the Chuck Liddell prot&eacute;g&eacute;.3.PAUL SASS VS JACOB VOLKMAN-this fight would see another first round submission as Paul Sass sinks in a quick triangle and armbar that forces Volkman to tap. This was a great showing from Sass as Jacob is a really tough opponent.4.DUANE LUDWIG VS DAN HARDY-this was a tough one for me to watch as I really like both guys. I never really want Duane to lose but if Hardy lost here he was on the verge of getting cut. So I was on the fence here with this one. Both guys trade and land some great shots on one another and work in the clinch but that leads to a big lead left hook that drops Duane. Dan thinks he has it won there but has to move in for the kill and gets the win after dropping some nasty elbows.5.JASON MILLER VS CB DOLLAWAY-I was looking forward to this fight so much just knowing that Mayhem would beat Dollaway. I was off my feet as the fight started as Miller landed a nice shot that sent CB back. But CB survived it and eventually had Miller down. Once up the trade some stiff jabs and Miller&#8217;s knee gives out on him causing Jason to fall, CB ends up on top. I was on my feet again at the beginning of the second round when Miller rocks him once again but CB survives and ends up on top again. The final round was all Dollaway as he took Miller down and controlled from there which lead to the UD win for CB.6.JAMIE VARNER VS EDSON BARBOSA-I was so excited for this fight as Varner is a favorite of mine and Barbosa has one of the greatest highlight reel head kick knockouts of all time. I knew this was going to be a great fight as these two try to end fights. As it turned out I was right as Barbosa was landing some great leg kicks while Varner was going all out with his punches. He ends up getting the TKO win after dropping Edson against the cage.7.DARRIN ELKINS VS DIEGO BRANDAO-good first round between these two as they trade momentum like Diego landing some huge shots like a flying knee but Elkins tries for submissions. They spend half the time on the ground and half on their feet, great round. The second round is spent on the feet for the first half of it until Elkins gets it to the ground and controls from there. The third round is mostly Elkins again after getting it down but towards the end Branao ends up on top. Still in the end Elkins gets the UD.On this disc you get a behind the scenes and the weigh-in show as special features.

IMHO, there wasn't a single great fight on the main card; merely a series of mismatches that resulted in 1st round stoppages.The main event wasn't even competitive and the end was never really in doubt.The co-main event was irrevocably altered by another elbow-induced blood bath before it even had a chance to become an actual fight. Many people called it a dominating performance by Cain Velasquez, but the bout really turned on one innocuous elbow which opened up a massive cut that led to Bigfoot Silva fighting completely blind from that point on. It's a bit difficult to offer resistance when your eyes are drowning in an undulating waterfall of your own blood. A fight like this would have been a PR disaster for the UFC had it occurred on a Fox show.The rest of the fights were devoid of anything resembling legitimate title contenders and were over almost as soon as they began.It was nice to see Shane Del Rosario show casual fans what real world class kickboxing looks like, but he had no answer once the fight hit the ground.If this is what passes for a great UFC show these days, then Fedor help us....the dream is over.",3,The UFC is officially past its prime.,1342742400,"07 20, 2012",2012,1365,"['standards', 'what', 'great', 'mma', 'event', 'have', 'fallen', 'so', 'drastically', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'show', 'several', 'quick', 'finishes', 'instantly', 'lauded', 'CLASSIC.UFC', '146', 'pertinent', 'example', 'IMHO', 'was', ""n't"", 'single', 'great', 'fight', 'main', 'card', 'merely', 'series', 'mismatches', 'resulted', '1st', 'round', 'stoppages.The', 'main', 'event', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'competitive', 'end', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'doubt.The', 'co-main', 'event', 'was', 'irrevocably', 'altered', 'elbow-induced', 'blood', 'bath', 'even', 'had', 'chance', 'become', 'actual', 'fight', 'Many', 'people', 'called', 'dominating', 'performance', 'Cain', 'Velasquez', 'bout', 'really', 'turned', 'one', 'innocuous', 'elbow', 'opened', 'up', 'massive', 'cut', 'led', 'Bigfoot', 'Silva', 'fighting', 'completely', 'point', 'bit', 'difficult', 'offer', 'resistance', 'when', 'eyes', 'are', 'drowning', 'undulating', 'waterfall', 'own', 'blood', 'fight', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'PR', 'disaster', 'UFC', 'had', 'occurred', 'Fox', 'show.The', 'rest', 'fights', 'were', 'devoid', 'anything', 'resembling', 'legitimate', 'title', 'contenders', 'were', 'over', 'almost', 'as', 'soon', 'began.It', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Shane', 'Del', 'Rosario', 'show', 'casual', 'fans', 'what', 'real', 'world', 'class', 'kickboxing', 'looks', 'had', 'answer', 'once', 'fight', 'hit', 'ground.If', 'passes', 'great', 'UFC', 'show', 'days', 'then', 'Fedor', 'help', '.the', 'dream']",N/A
