The french film had stunning visuals, breathaking cast members, and a superb script. However, when the Writers of this series decided to base this adaptation of B&B; on the French version, they didn't carry anything over.The Visuals are dark and dreary, and don't make one interested in the film. Which is a shame really, because how are little one's supposed to be interested in this? Children need big songs and flashy colors to keep entertainted, which was why the Disney version did so well. All the colors here are muted, giving off an almost Gothic look too it. Not a good idea for kids. The costumes are pretty, and for 'older' kids this might be good...The Acting is lackluster to say the least. Susan Sarandon as Beauty was a very odd choice; as she looks much to old for the part. Her acting is bland, and Susan looks very bored thru the movie. Klaus Kinski plays the Beast, and does what he can with part. Which isn't much with the limited script. Angelica Huston plays one of the mean sisters, and steals the show from both of the 'stars.'As I said in the title; this movie is very disturbing. You see, one thing the Writers DID carry over from the almost adult French version was the fact that the Beast burns himself. Yes, Burns. It was alright for the French version, but does not belong in a kids adaptation. One night, Beauty is asleep in her bed, when she hears screaming of sorts. As she climbs out of bed, she see's the Beast on her balcony, covered in blood and smoking. Terribly frightning music plays here as the Beast screechs for Beauty to close the curtain to the balcony. It happens one more time as Beauty walks down the hall as the Beast screams, where she sees him walking down the hallway with his hands smoking.These things don't belong in a kids adaptation. As a child I was unnevered by these scenes, and couldn't bear to watch this film. As I got older, these scenes suddenly became 'cool' as I entered the phase where everything violent seems cool.Stick with the animted Disney version of Beauty and the Beast. If you do show this version, stick with the older kids.",1,Disturbing to say the least,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,2202,"['many', 'version', 'B', 'B', 'carbon', 'copy', 'famed', 'French', 'version', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'french', 'film', 'had', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'breathaking', 'cast', 'members', 'superb', 'script', 'However', 'when', 'Writers', 'series', 'decided', 'base', 'adaptation', 'B', 'B', 'French', 'version', 'did', ""n't"", 'carry', 'anything', 'over.The', 'Visuals', 'are', 'dark', 'dreary', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'one', 'interested', 'film', 'Which', 'shame', 'really', 'how', 'are', 'little', 'one', 'supposed', 'be', 'interested', 'Children', 'need', 'big', 'songs', 'flashy', 'colors', 'keep', 'entertainted', 'was', 'why', 'Disney', 'version', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'colors', 'here', 'are', 'muted', 'giving', 'off', 'almost', 'Gothic', 'look', 'too', 'Not', 'good', 'idea', 'kids', 'costumes', 'are', 'pretty', ""'older"", 'kids', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'Acting', 'lackluster', 'say', 'least', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Beauty', 'was', 'very', 'odd', 'choice', 'much', 'old', 'part', 'acting', 'bland', 'Susan', 'very', 'bored', 'movie', 'Klaus', 'Kinski', 'Beast', 'what', 'can', 'part', 'Which', ""n't"", 'much', 'limited', 'script', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'one', 'mean', 'sisters', 'show', ""'stars"", ""'As"", 'said', 'title', 'movie', 'very', 'disturbing', 'see', 'one', 'thing', 'Writers', 'DID', 'carry', 'almost', 'adult', 'French', 'version', 'was', 'fact', 'Beast', 'Yes', 'Burns', 'was', 'alright', 'French', 'version', 'not', 'belong', 'kids', 'adaptation', 'One', 'night', 'Beauty', 'asleep', 'bed', 'when', 'screaming', 'sorts', 'bed', 'see', 'Beast', 'balcony', 'covered', 'blood', 'smoking', 'Terribly', 'frightning', 'music', 'plays', 'here', 'Beast', 'screechs', 'Beauty', 'close', 'curtain', 'balcony', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'Beauty', 'walks', 'down', 'hall', 'Beast', 'screams', 'where', 'walking', 'down', 'hallway', 'hands', 'smoking.These', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'kids', 'adaptation', 'child', 'was', 'unnevered', 'scenes', 'could', ""n't"", 'bear', 'watch', 'film', 'got', 'older', 'scenes', 'suddenly', 'became', ""'cool"", 'entered', 'phase', 'where', 'everything', 'violent', 'cool.Stick', 'animted', 'Disney', 'version', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'do', 'show', 'version', 'stick', 'older', 'kids']",Faerie Tale Theatre - Beauty and the Beast

Youngest daughter Beauty (Susan Sarandon) selflessly sacrifices her own freedom to release her father.Once in the castle, Beauty slowly begins to win the friendship and trust of the Beast, who hides a gentle and kind heart beneath his frightening exterior.Directed by Roger Vadim and co-starring Anjelica Huston and Nancy Lenehan as Beauty's jealous sisters, this version of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is based on Jean Cocteau's celebrated French movie classic.

Perkins ""wide reader""","[0, 0]","SPOILERS FOLLOWFaerie Tale Theatre's adaptation of the classic French story ""Beauty and the Beast"" stands apart from even the best entries in the venerable series.  Starring Susan Sarandon, Klaus Kinski, and even including Anjelica Huston in a small role, it is the one episode in the series that boasts a truly filmic appearance.Directed by Roger Vadim, it features a fairly dark and mature tone.  Additionally, Klaus Kinski's Beast can be genuinely frightening, especially for younger viewers.  Tremendously ugly and with a nearly continuous low growl, he is fearlessly presented as the complete physical antithesis to Susan Sarandon's Beauty.  Ms. Sarandon brings her considerable acting talents to bear in a versatile and sympathetic performance.Faerie Tale Theatre's adaptation of ""Beauty and the Beast"" is easily one of the best episodes of the series.",5,Extraordinary adaptation is unique even among its celebrated brethren,1270252800,"04 3, 2010",2010,858,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWFaerie', 'Tale', 'Theatre', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'French', 'story', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'apart', 'even', 'best', 'entries', 'venerable', 'series', 'Starring', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Klaus', 'Kinski', 'even', 'including', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'small', 'role', 'one', 'episode', 'series', 'truly', 'filmic', 'appearance.Directed', 'Roger', 'Vadim', 'fairly', 'dark', 'mature', 'tone', 'Additionally', 'Klaus', 'Kinski', 'Beast', 'can', 'be', 'genuinely', 'frightening', 'especially', 'younger', 'viewers', 'Tremendously', 'ugly', 'nearly', 'continuous', 'low', 'growl', 'fearlessly', 'presented', 'complete', 'physical', 'antithesis', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Beauty', 'Ms.', 'Sarandon', 'considerable', 'acting', 'talents', 'bear', 'versatile', 'sympathetic', 'performance.Faerie', 'Tale', 'Theatre', 'adaptation', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'series']",Faerie Tale Theatre - Beauty and the Beast

Though Sarandon is nowhere as beautiful as French actress, Josette Day, I must admit that she was perfectly cast for the part and made you feel with her with every moment of her performance as Beauty. Klaus Kinski gave a terrific,powerful performance as the Beast. Though nowhere as stunning as Jean Marais, this guy has powerful talent to pull of this role.
