She also appears in Self Bikini Ready Fast.  She leads you through this 35 minute workout and is joined by 2 background exercisers, one who shows lower impact modifications.  All you will need for this video is a set of light weights (2-5 lbs).  The setting on a beach in Mexico which is very nice.The workout is split up into several segments, the first being a simple warmup consisting of marches, step touches, mambos and squats.  Then you will move into the next segment which is the ballet series.  Not to difficult, Ellen will take you through a series of ballet moves such as center plies, calf lifts, tiptoe plies (center plie with heels lifted), standing oblique work (imprints), and rear leg extensions.  She will repeat the series a couple times with less reps and adding some moves such as a scoop move where is looks like you are gathering flowers, and a swirl move that targets the obliques a bit.  I really liked this segment, it brings out the graceful side in me.The next 2 segments are cardio, fun simple combinations with some higher impact moves to elevate the heartrate.  But you could also follow the modifier who shows all low impact options.  The first combination consists of march ups, jacks, heel digs, knee lifts, v-steps, skier squats, and shuffles.  The sequence is repeated a few times.  The second combination consists of step kicks, v-steps, jumpropes, 1 leg plyo jumps, jump squats, side to side jumropes, march up/back or bunny hops back, double jacks and one legged hops.  Again this series is repeated a few times and power moves are added if you like.The next segment is toning work with light weights.  You start with bicep curls then you will add a reverse lunge, then side squats with side deltoid lifts, then you will stand in place for a move that works the shoulders more, it's like a side lateral raise but you raise your arms up with palms up and lower them down with palms down.  You will repeat this a few times, this time adding a knee raise to the bicep/reverse lunge and a inner thigh sqeeze to the side squat/side deltoid lift, after the inner thigh squeeze, you will stay standing and add some outer thigh and rear leg lifts.  Towards the end you will do a longer set of the bicep/lunges and side squat/deltoid lifts alternating them before the cooldown.Overall this isn't a bad workout, I really liked the cardio segments and the ballet series, the toning series was just okay for me though.  I didn't really get much out of it.  Therefore this would be a good workout for lighter days or for those who are beginner/intermediate levels, or if you are just looking to tone up.  Ellen as always does a nice job as the lead.There is a brief bonus workout, Total Body Turnaround which consist of more toning work which would be a nice add-on for those looking for more toning.  The segment itself is only 5 minutes or so long and consists of more moves done in combination such as side lateral raises while balancing on one leg, triceps extensions while doing static lunges, and biceps curls while in plie squat position.  There is also some brief floorwork, inner thigh lifts and oblique work before finishing out with a rowing exercise which targets the abs, arms and back) and a seated boxing exercise which works the arms and abs.

This is an easy ballet/pilates video with minimal cardio. My heart rate was around 50-60% of maximum - better than walking, but not much. Some of the cardio is kickboxing-inspired. It's a good beginner workout with easy intervals, basic lunges/biceps strength moves, and a pretty outdoor scene.

I work out pretty regularly, and when the weights segment comes on, I find that I get tired really quickly.This is a challenging workout, I sweat like crazy, but it does get incredibly repetitive. The sound quality isn't all that great either, Ellen's voice is kind of muffled,  and one of the girls in the video doesn't stop grinning, which I found to be incredibly annoying.All in all, good workout, although sound quality could use some work.
