But Elvis and Anabelle was a movie that I simply had to own after seeing it the first time.  It started out a little confusing because I was not sure whether it was syfi, or fantasy or what. But soon enough the story got me sucked in. Max Minghella and Blake Lively do such a good job and they are both EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE in their roles, both in appearance and in character personality.  They are true and realistic characters.

This is one of those films where the synopsis might fail to reveal what a good film it really is.  With a cast which includes Blake Lively, Mary Steenbergen, Keith Carradine and Max Minghella, along with a very different performance by Joe Mantegna, who is one of my favotite actors, as alocal mortician with a hunch back, this movie works on so many levels.  It is a combination of happy, sad, funny and occassionally strange.  I totally enjoyed watching this film and highly recommend it to anyone (not only women) who likes good heart warming films.  It may be thought of as a 'chick-flick' but it most definitely is more than that.

1333944,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B0039PGHB4,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[5, 12]","I got this for my store due to all of the stellar reviews here and elsewhere, and I can see where some people might get a few things out of it, but there were way too many faults for it to be the 5-star listed here.The story follows an unlicensed embalmer played by Minghella that while under the brain-damaged eye of his father (adequately filled by Joe Mantegna) miraculously brings back to life the beautiful dead-girl client played by Lively. No explanations are given either way regarding faith/science so the movie focuses more on the resulting love story. Carradine and Steenburgen overact their bits, and the amount of flubs are prevalent throughout (crew members in reflections, 10' rain circles around characters for mood while it is sunny out - multiple times, bad stock in some scenes where there is a film line right through their face, indoor sequences that were supposed to be at night but it is sunny outside, sound mix off, bad CGI at the end, etc.). The story does have some touching moments, but it is almost a minimalist film with the amount of slow build and deliberate heart-string moments.The picture quality varies throughout but maintains overall and the sound is an average 5.1. The only special feature is an eight minute director interview laden with film clips so there are only a few informative moments. 3.5 stars for the film, one extra and seeing Blake Lively for 105 minutes.
