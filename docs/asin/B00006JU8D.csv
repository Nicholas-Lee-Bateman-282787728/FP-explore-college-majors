719175,A2DRHY9HJ4DE1F,B00006JU8D,Ahmed,"[6, 8]","I love the Powerpuff girl-cartoons. The film was great and had it all-adventure, comedy, they're cute Bubbles, and creativeness. The film was cute and was as good as Scooby-Doo. However M. Lillard (who played Shaggy) would bring up a hard competition! The movie was exactly like the cartoon series and is for all Powerpuff girls fans, Cartoon network cartoons fans, and for Girl power based flick fans! The girls are really like everyday children except for their super powers of coarse. It's a film that will be inspiring to children. I laughed during a lot of scenes.Those who weren't Powerpuff girls fans before probably will be now. All Powerpuff Girls fans won't be disappointed! The light humour, wise cracks, and lovable characters make this cartoon enjoyable. It's a Warner Bros flick that's worth watching for anyone who enjoys animated series. As well as entertaining you, the film features morals about making the right choices. Young kids will especially be entertained throughout the movie with adorable little heroes (heroines) fighting crime and trying to save the world. It's a hard-not-to like version of Arnold S action flicks with cutsey pie jokes and enjoyable scenes. It has fun adventure that mainly people who love goofiness in flicks will love. It's a movie version that both adults &kids; would love. It has a clever plot and a good story.For those who have no idea what the Powerpuff Girls story is about- you'll have no problem. The movie tells you everything-about how Bubbles, Buttercup, and Blossom turn into super heroes and how they got to fighting crime! It's without doubt (alongside Lilo&Stich;) the year's funniest animated feature!Overall it's a pleasing feature and is so far funnier than any film I've watched this year! I guarantee fun but once again that's possible if you enjoy light comedies and animated features! As for all Powerpuff Girl fans-you'll all love it! Those of you who very rarely like cartoons but enjoyed the very entertaining Monsters Inc... This probably isn't something for you!...",5,It's like watching a kid's version of Charlie's Angels!,1025740800,"07 4, 2002",2002,2043,"['love', 'Powerpuff', 'girl-cartoons', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'had', 'all-adventure', 'comedy', ""'re"", 'cute', 'Bubbles', 'creativeness', 'film', 'was', 'cute', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'Scooby-Doo', 'However', 'M.', 'Lillard', 'who', 'played', 'Shaggy', 'would', 'bring', 'up', 'hard', 'competition', 'movie', 'was', 'exactly', 'cartoon', 'series', 'Powerpuff', 'girls', 'fans', 'Cartoon', 'network', 'cartoons', 'fans', 'Girl', 'power', 'based', 'flick', 'fans', 'girls', 'are', 'really', 'everyday', 'children', 'super', 'powers', 'coarse', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'inspiring', 'children', 'laughed', 'lot', 'scenes.Those', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'Powerpuff', 'girls', 'fans', 'probably', 'will', 'be', 'now', 'Powerpuff', 'Girls', 'fans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'light', 'humour', 'wise', 'cracks', 'lovable', 'characters', 'make', 'cartoon', 'enjoyable', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'flick', 'worth', 'watching', 'anyone', 'who', 'animated', 'series', 'As', 'well', 'entertaining', 'film', 'morals', 'making', 'right', 'choices', 'Young', 'kids', 'will', 'especially', 'be', 'entertained', 'movie', 'adorable', 'little', 'heroes', 'heroines', 'fighting', 'crime', 'trying', 'save', 'world', 'hard-not-to', 'version', 'Arnold', 'S', 'action', 'flicks', 'cutsey', 'pie', 'jokes', 'enjoyable', 'scenes', 'fun', 'adventure', 'mainly', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'goofiness', 'flicks', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'version', 'adults', 'kids', 'would', 'love', 'clever', 'plot', 'good', 'story.For', 'who', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'Powerpuff', 'Girls', 'story', 'about-', ""'ll"", 'have', 'problem', 'movie', 'everything-about', 'how', 'Bubbles', 'Buttercup', 'Blossom', 'turn', 'super', 'heroes', 'how', 'got', 'fighting', 'crime', 'doubt', 'Lilo', 'Stich', 'year', 'funniest', 'animated', 'feature', 'pleasing', 'feature', 'so', 'far', 'funnier', 'film', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'year', 'guarantee', 'fun', 'once', 'again', 'possible', 'enjoy', 'light', 'comedies', 'animated', 'features', 'Powerpuff', 'Girl', 'fans-you', ""'ll"", 'love', 'who', 'very', 'rarely', 'cartoons', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Monsters', 'Inc', 'probably', ""n't"", 'something']",N/A

Anyway I way watching cartoon network when it said the moive was coming on next then and black screen came up saying The following film may contain some content not sutible for young childern. I was shocked and I was even more shocked by what I saw in the moive.

Also the show and moive Insults boys like in one epsoide the stupid girls clam that boys are made of puppy dog tails,snails,and poop! How Insulting and dusgisting. And in the moive boys go ha ha at them and so the power puff grils knock them out or etheir they were dead. The show has set off over 100 bad examples of how are kids are supose to behave. Then latter they make a show called the condname kids next door about a group of kids that fight adults. Just unexcetble and rude.

719182,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00006JU8D,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 1]","I'm in the category where I'm watching this having never seen an episode of the Powerpuff Girls. Recently, I started becoming interested in voice acting and was checking out many animation shows to ""hone my skills"" when this one grabbed my interest. The movie is basically for those like me that never watched the show but it might spoil you.Professor Utonium wants to create some daughters using sugar, spice and everything nice but his monkey Mojo knocks some Chemical X into the solution causing the monkey to grow a gigantic brain and 3 girls: Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup. Each one is unique with Blossom being the leader type and quick to come up with a solution, Bubbles is the emotional and sickeningly cute one while Buttercup is the brass tough one(who sounds like Tommy from Rugrats which is no surprise since Elizabeth Daily provided that voice).An innocent game of tag at school however gets the girls very competitive when they start thrashing Townsville with their speed and strength. They are then disdained by the public, the professor included. Walking home, they run into Mojo who wants to create the ""make-the-town-a-better-place"" machine so the girls help him unbeknown to them what his real intentions are. He kidnaps all the monkeys and causes them to wreck havoc. So of course the girls must save the day.You get many origins in the show of course not just the start of the Girls and Mojo Jojo but also the shows catchphrase ""saving the world before bedtime"" and just who exactly named the Powerpuff Girls.The animation looks nice but most likely you've seen better but that's not really the point. This is the style of the series but the animation is a bit more ambitious with multi-plane shots and some 3D backgrounds or backgrounds that look 3D.The voice actors do a good job and to be honest, my favorite would have to be the high pitched Bubbles played by Tara Strong. Roger Jackson(a.k.a ""the voice on the phone"" from the Scream movies) does a good job as Mojo Jojo including a fast little rant regarding his plans.It is disappointing that it's only in fullscreen but knowing the DVD people, we'll get a double dip soon enough",4,Good introduction to the series...in a way,1115596800,"05 9, 2005",2005,2158,"[""'m"", 'category', 'where', ""'m"", 'watching', 'having', 'never', 'seen', 'episode', 'Powerpuff', 'Girls', 'Recently', 'started', 'becoming', 'interested', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'checking', 'out', 'many', 'animation', 'shows', 'hone', 'skills', 'when', 'one', 'grabbed', 'interest', 'movie', 'basically', 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'might', 'spoil', 'you.Professor', 'Utonium', 'create', 'daughters', 'using', 'sugar', 'spice', 'everything', 'nice', 'monkey', 'Mojo', 'Chemical', 'X', 'solution', 'causing', 'monkey', 'grow', 'gigantic', 'brain', '3', 'girls', 'Blossom', 'Bubbles', 'Buttercup', 'one', 'unique', 'Blossom', 'being', 'leader', 'type', 'quick', 'come', 'up', 'solution', 'Bubbles', 'emotional', 'sickeningly', 'cute', 'one', 'Buttercup', 'brass', 'tough', 'one', 'who', 'Tommy', 'Rugrats', 'surprise', 'Elizabeth', 'Daily', 'provided', 'voice', '.An', 'innocent', 'game', 'tag', 'school', 'however', 'girls', 'very', 'competitive', 'when', 'start', 'thrashing', 'Townsville', 'speed', 'strength', 'are', 'then', 'disdained', 'public', 'professor', 'included', 'Walking', 'home', 'run', 'Mojo', 'who', 'create', 'make-the-town-a-better-place', 'machine', 'girls', 'help', 'unbeknown', 'what', 'real', 'intentions', 'are', 'monkeys', 'wreck', 'havoc', 'course', 'girls', 'must', 'save', 'day.You', 'get', 'many', 'origins', 'show', 'course', 'not', 'just', 'start', 'Girls', 'Mojo', 'Jojo', 'also', 'shows', 'catchphrase', 'saving', 'world', 'bedtime', 'just', 'who', 'exactly', 'named', 'Powerpuff', 'Girls.The', 'animation', 'nice', 'most', 'likely', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'not', 'really', 'point', 'style', 'series', 'animation', 'bit', 'more', 'ambitious', 'multi-plane', 'shots', '3D', 'backgrounds', 'backgrounds', 'look', '3D.The', 'voice', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'be', 'honest', 'favorite', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'high', 'pitched', 'Bubbles', 'played', 'Tara', 'Strong', 'Roger', 'Jackson', 'voice', 'phone', 'Scream', 'movies', 'good', 'job', 'Mojo', 'Jojo', 'including', 'fast', 'little', 'rant', 'regarding', 'plans.It', 'disappointing', 'only', 'fullscreen', 'knowing', 'DVD', 'people', ""'ll"", 'get', 'double', 'dip', 'soon', 'enough']",N/A
719183,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00006JU8D,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[4, 6]","Normally, full-length features of TV series aren't as good as the original, even if they are done with the original actors.  Ditto for animated films.  The younger the audience, the more it will be geared towards them, which means it may have no substance.  There are a few exceptions, such as the adult-geared South Park, which outshone the series, and the subject of this review, the Powerpuff Girls Movie, which despite its youthful audience, has pop culture references that only adults might get.  And it isn't that long, clocking in at 73 minutes.  So my earlier assessment in a review may have been less than generous.Basically, the early part of the movie dealing with their creation is a revised, extended retread of the episode &quot;Mr. Mojo's Rising.&quot;  As I'm one for program continuity, I'm relieved it doesn't contradict the events in that story that much.  Fans can compare the two and come up with a firm origin story that dovetails.  But the bottom line is that Townsville is a haven for crime and lawlessness, and it is that backdrop in which Professor Utonium, that &quot;forward thinking man who looks back&quot; creates the trio.  The movie serves to explain how and why they became dedicated to fighting crime.Blossom is so named because of her directness, Bubbles because she is cute and bubbly, and Buttercup because it also starts with a B, which may explain why she's such a grump at times.  Anyway, the first half hour, dealing with their super powers and the Professor's amazement and delight at what he's created, is clearly the happiest moment of the movie.Then comes the Powerpuff Girls' idea of urban renewal, which is basically to--unintentionally, of course--tear the concrete jungle of Townsville, as well as their kindergarden, in a superpowered game of tag, which they learn from Mitch the bully.  The Professor is arrested for being partly responsible, and the girls are branded pariahs, before running into Jojo.  The four team up to create an invention that will save Townsville.  However, no thanks to Jojo, that invention turns out to be a device that reverses the existing primate hierarchy, and the girls' association with it further ruins their image in the eyes of the Townies and worse yet, the Professor.The obvious pop culture references come from Planet Of The Apes and King Kong, be it dialogue or scenes.  However, the theme of xenophobia, fear of the unknown, is key here, as the Townies turn on the girls influenced by the usually distortion blitz committed by the media.  And the animation style and pace is taken to higher levels, especially the zappity-pow final battle, which is another point in having a feature-length film.There are cameos from Fuzzy Lumpkins and the Gangreen Gang has a few moments, so that hints them as the key villains in a possible second movie, assuming McCracken and company decide to do another.  Which leads me to this:  The Powerpuff Girls Movie shouldn't have tanked at the box office.

How did they become the heroic trio that Townsville has come to depend on? How did Mojo Jojo first make himself known? The answers to those three questions are pretty much the whole film and, honestly, there's not a single surprise in any of the movie's answers.

When Cartoon Network started drawing those three little girls and that city did they know that it would become such a huge hit? Probally no. The film baffled me a little bit also. The success of the television show is so huge. People buy products all the time and there is always some sort of buzz about ""The Powerpuff Girls."" If the idea and the show are so huge, why didn't the film do as well at the box office? It was number 9 on the top then on it's first weekend last summer. I don't really see why though. I think that this movie should have did better. The critics thought it was great and the few people sho saw it liked it.I didn't see it in the theatres. I have only seen about ten episodes of the show and that was right before the movie came out in theatres. I didn't get to see it in the theatres so I had to wait untill it's release on DVD. I can't reveiw the features on the DVD but I can talk about the film itself as a whole. I saw the movie on a Pay Per Veiw cable thing.For those of you who have watched the show, you know that it is about three little girls who were invented by The Professor. They were created by ""sugar,spice, and everything nice."" But The Professor put in another thing. CHEMICAL X! Thus these three little girls with superpowers came out and fought evil in there city. The City of Townsville is always being under attack mostly by the evil monkey Mojo Jojo! In each episode the three girls (Blossum,Bubbles,and Buttercup) defeat Mojo Jojo. This movie however is a prequal to the show. A descripted story on how the girls where made and there first encounter with Mojo Jojo.The Professor is looking to make people to help Townsville from crime. He makes The Powerpuff Girls. Everybody loves them. The kids at school love playing with them and everything is going good for them. Untill one boy teaches them the rules of the game tag. They play all over town and end up destroying it. All the citizens hate them. They go to school the next day but never get picked up that afternoon. The Professor was arrested. They walk home and meet Jojo. He is also hated because he has superpowers. The girls decide to help him build a machine to help Townsville. They don't know Jojo tricked them into making a machine to help Jojo rule the Earth forever. All goes according to plan and then Jojo decides to be named MOJO JOJO!The three girls adventure in Townsville is great and I think that this movie should have made more money. I enjoyed it and the animation was great. I mildly enjoyed the mini cartoon at the beginning. Dexter's Labortory's Chicken Scratch. I think you should see Thw Powerpuff Girls movie.

The action, emotion, plot twists, over the top finale, everything is PowerPacked the PowerPuff Girl way.Our story begins with the Girl's creation. After witnessing a supermarket holdup, Professor Utonium, decides to create perfect little girls, little does he know, his Chemical X, accidentally mixed in with his concoction of sugar, spice, and everything nice, results in the most powerful kindergarteners anywhere. Thus, the PowerPuff Girls were born! Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup.Blossom, the intellectual, is the leader of her superhero trio. Brainy and sassy, she can outwit even the most enormous monster, or the most sinister villain, even Mojo Jojo!Bubble is the cute and cuddly comic relief. Make no mistakes though, she may spend her off-time coloring and playing with her stuffed animals, but when the bad guys come around, Bubbles has proven time and time again that she's just as tough (and sometimes even tougher, than her sisters).Buttercup (so named because it also begins with B) is the tough one. She's a miniature cartoon version of  Joan Jett. She likes to fight bad guys, and doesn't take crap from anyone.As our story continues, we meet the mayor, Miss Bellum, the kindergarten teacher, and of course the most evil presence to come along since Darth Vader, Mojo Jojo! He may be no taller than 2 feet (with a foot high brain!), but he is the essence of pure evil. Though he can never decide if he wants to rule the world or destroy it.In this grand film of epic proportions, Mojo tricks the girls into building his secret laboratory. It is located conveniently in the center of Townsville on top of an active volcano. After his lair is complete, Mojo gets enough chemical X to inject all the primates at the zoo.You can imagine the chaos and panic that comes from that! Squadrons of flying monkeys that spit a rainstorm, a mighty gorilla who wants to rival Mojo, an orangutan driving a machine of mass destruction, white polar wicked monkey, sonic booming cymbal playing monkey, and a crazed chimpanzee that needs a straight jacket.Watch in amazement time and time again.

It's an origin story (the kind ALL superhero movies are) where the girls meet everyone for the first time.  I promise I'm not giving anything away here.  This all becomes very evident while the credits are still rolling.  The movie is fairly short.  In fact, if you know what to look for, you will realize that this is simply three episodes of the tv series put together the way the Samurai Jack movie was done.  So whats to like about this movie?  Script:  Same witty one-liners, puns and culteral references we've come to expect from Powerpuff Girls. (Human has kept monkey under his thumb for too long!  Now we must oppose that thumb and begin our Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes!)  There is a fair amout of violent sight gags and a little crude humor, but no more than you would come to expect from the tv series.  Music: Ranges from orchestral to techno-pop.  Nothing to make an album out of, but it's always the right tune, for the right amount of time, at the right time.Animation:  The character designs have not changed in any way.  The girls move (slightly) more fluidly, and a combination of cel art and 3d computer graphics really bring Townsville to life.  Normally, I hate combining CG with cel art, but it works here.

719206,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B00006JU8D,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[0, 0]","""This is the best gift ever."" ""Yes, it is.""I've never been a huge fan of The PowerPuff Girls. The show was always kind of hit and miss for me. But some of the episodes were truly brilliant, and when I heard that the movie was coming to theaters I was definitely interested. Maybe it was the trailer, maybe it was all the other movies that came out at the same time; or maybe I was just busy. But somehow or other I never got around to seeing this movie in theaters. For a long time now (ever since the DVD came out) I've wanted to give it a rent. I rented it a few weeks ago and bought it almost immediately afterward. I feel like I horribly cheated myself by missing this one in theaters. Many people who haven't seen this movie probably think what I first thought when I heard about the movie. ""Probably largely more of the same."" More cuteness, more simple yet stylish animation, and WAY more fight scenes, right? WRONG!From the moment the movie starts, it's apparent that WAY more work went into this movie than into your average episode of the series. WAY better animation, WAY better music, WAY better dialog. TONS of character development. Dramatic camera angles. Yes, all the good things that make great anime, or great cartoons, or great movies, crammed into a little over an hour. If you've ever watched an episodes of Dexter's Lab or PowerPuff girls, you know what to expect. Parody of classic movies (in this case, especially planet of the apes), with cool zoom-out shots, ominous villain laughing and slick action sequences. And speaking of action...""You're it!""Does this movie have action? Yes it does. But not non-stop way-too much action. More a situation starts slow then gets progressively more energetic as dramatic tension builds and then fury is unleashed in an awesome high-speed fight.Take the infamous tag sequence for example. When the girls first go to school we, like the professor, just know that something is going to go wrong. They're going to cause destruction with their powers. But when he goes to pick them up they're playing hopscotch and other little kid games, being perfect little angels. Then someone shows them how to play tag. And naturally, Buttercup isn't content with just running at normal speed. As the girls chase each other, they gradually build up speed until the ground behind them starts to melt, and then they take off into the air. The music builds up at just the right time and in the right way to get your heart pumping during this scene, and I don't think I've ever seen a scene in a movie that better conveys the sheer joy a person would experience if they could propel their self at almost limitless speed.""How can you understand what it means to be...A FREAK!?""This another interesting thing about this movie is the fact that it is about the origins of the PowerPuff Girls. Hasn't that already been covered? Don't we already know about that? Do we really need to go over this again?! Oh yes indeed. As this movie takes it's time to cover the story of how the girls were created, how they experience the fear and sadness of being different from everyone else, and how they ultimately attain their resolve to use their powers to fight for good and to save people. One of, if not THE cornerstone of the movie is undoubtedly the one who eventually becomes the Powerpuff Girls' archnemesis, Mojo Jojo. In this movie we see an interaction between the evil one and the girls unlike any other seen in the series. Mojo is evil, and has plans for world domination. But the girls don't know that. And when he asks for their help, they unwittingly find themselves assisting Mojo in his greatest and first plan ever. Now, Mojo has had a lot of plans, but I can never recall one that worked out quite this cool. You have to see it for yourself.""a Sweeter time, when there was a Spice to life, and everything was...Nice.""Besides the exceptional camera angles, dialog, and action sequences, the dvd of this movie features truly exceptional picture quality. I first watched it on a progressive-scan dvd player hooked up to a widescreen HDTV. I thought the picture was widescreen until I looked on the movie box. The image does not appear to be cropped or panned anywhere (despite the fact that it HAS been cropped from its original aspect ratio).

719209,ADXJBL8H8VWVT,B00006JU8D,Tony,"[5, 18]","I'm a grown man and I took a 3-year-old girl to see this. I watched it on TV and actually thought the series was pretty good, and the kid loved it. We lasted about 30 minutes before we walked out. The kid had not laughed once and you didn't hear a peep from any of the other 9 kids (yup, kids came out in droves for this turkey). Boring wasn't the word.It looked like it was thrown together in a rush just to make a few bucks. The cartoon channel should be ashamed for throwing this piece of junk out. I thought the Gumby movie was bad, but I would rather watch the Gumby movie a hundred times in a row instead of going back to see the rest of this thing.In the short time we were at the theater, there was no story. It was basically the Powerpuff girls running around like they were on speed. I think the geniuses who put this movie out figured there wasn't a need for a real story because the kids just wanted to see the girls.

719210,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00006JU8D,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 6]","To be honest, I didn't know anything about ""Powerpuff Girls"" even though Cartoon Network can be seen also in Japan, and I happened to have seen American animation series like ""Flintstones"" there.  But they decided to release ""PPG: The Movie"" in theaters in Japan, so I went to see that.And the film proved an unexpected joy; though the theater was not full of audience (actually very few), but the kids behind me were enjoying the film, and interestingly, parents too.  Even though the film has failed commercially to impress us (at the opening week the film reached only No. 9 in US box-office chart), those who showed up at the theater would come to love those wide-eyed cute girls, Blossom, Bubbles, and boyish Buttercup, without previuosly watching the original TV episodes.In fact, the film is virtually ""Episode I"" of TV series that has been running more than three years, so non-die-hard ""PPG"" fans can easily enter the world of Townsville, where three super-girls (who still go to kindergarten) fight against evil ape Mojo Jojo.  The film introduces how the girls are born in the laboratory of Professor Utonium, with sugar and spice and everything nice (plus Chemical X), just as catchy 60s pop song goes.  There are regular characters that appear in the TV series (so I heard), but you don't have to know anything about them to enjoy the film.  Wise choice of moviemakers.The film, as some have complained with some justification, is NOT for little kids and parents who seek for moral and message in animation films.  This film is not as outrageous as ""South Park"" but certainly it includes some violent contents, one of which is the total destruction of kindergarten and the city itself due to the girls' practical joke, and some child play that everyone knows.  But the girls just can't help it.The story falters sometimes, especially in the first half; we all know that this weird green ape with a paper bag on his head must be a villain; we know that the professor, compared with those kids and bad monkeys, looks very insipid and boring.  But wait till the second half when everything gets into gear.  The last scene has rousing actions by the girls.Director Craig McCracken gives a unique style of drawing and color, and about its designs only, the film is memorable.  And proabably he is a fan of Japanese animations, or at least he knows soething about it.  Fighting girls remind us Japanese ""Sailor Moon""; fighting and chasing (or mayham) on the street is a favorite device of Japanimation (like ""Urusei Yatsura""); or the idea of hero/heroine created by a doctor resembles the situation of classic anime ""Astro Boy,"" and so on.  Of course, these Japanese products owe much to American older animations, but his style itself is, in my eye, quite closer to Japanese counterpart, rather to Disney and Hannah Barbera's works.  That might explain my and other Japanese audience's joyful reaction to ""Powerpuff Girls.""Anyway, if you or your kids want to see something with a bit more of edge, something spicier than ""Pokemon"" in watching animation, try it.  It is hard not to love those girls.",4,"""Episode I"" of Cute Little Girls You Can Never Hate",1029024000,"08 11, 2002",2002,3106,"['be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Powerpuff', 'Girls', 'even', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'also', 'Japan', 'happened', 'have', 'seen', 'American', 'animation', 'series', 'Flintstones', 'there', 'decided', 'release', 'PPG', 'Movie', 'theaters', 'Japan', 'so', 'went', 'see', 'film', 'proved', 'unexpected', 'joy', 'theater', 'was', 'not', 'full', 'audience', 'actually', 'very', 'few', 'kids', 'were', 'enjoying', 'film', 'interestingly', 'parents', 'too', 'Even', 'film', 'failed', 'commercially', 'impress', 'opening', 'week', 'film', 'reached', 'only', 'No', '9', 'US', 'box-office', 'chart', 'who', 'showed', 'up', 'theater', 'would', 'come', 'love', 'wide-eyed', 'cute', 'girls', 'Blossom', 'Bubbles', 'boyish', 'Buttercup', 'previuosly', 'watching', 'original', 'TV', 'episodes.In', 'fact', 'film', 'virtually', 'Episode', 'TV', 'series', 'been', 'running', 'more', 'three', 'years', 'so', 'non-die-hard', 'PPG', 'fans', 'can', 'easily', 'enter', 'world', 'Townsville', 'where', 'three', 'super-girls', 'who', 'still', 'go', 'kindergarten', 'fight', 'evil', 'ape', 'Mojo', 'Jojo', 'film', 'how', 'girls', 'are', 'born', 'laboratory', 'Professor', 'Utonium', 'sugar', 'spice', 'everything', 'nice', 'Chemical', 'X', 'just', 'catchy', '60s', 'pop', 'song', 'are', 'regular', 'characters', 'appear', 'TV', 'series', 'heard', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'know', 'anything', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Wise', 'choice', 'moviemakers.The', 'film', 'have', 'complained', 'justification', 'NOT', 'little', 'kids', 'parents', 'who', 'seek', 'moral', 'message', 'animation', 'films', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'outrageous', 'South', 'Park', 'certainly', 'violent', 'contents', 'one', 'total', 'destruction', 'kindergarten', 'city', 'due', 'girls', 'practical', 'joke', 'child', 'play', 'everyone', 'girls', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'it.The', 'story', 'falters', 'sometimes', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'know', 'weird', 'green', 'ape', 'paper', 'bag', 'head', 'must', 'be', 'villain', 'know', 'professor', 'compared', 'kids', 'bad', 'monkeys', 'very', 'insipid', 'boring', 'wait', 'second', 'half', 'when', 'everything', 'gear', 'last', 'scene', 'rousing', 'actions', 'girls.Director', 'Craig', 'McCracken', 'unique', 'style', 'drawing', 'color', 'designs', 'only', 'film', 'memorable', 'proabably', 'fan', 'Japanese', 'animations', 'least', 'soething', 'Fighting', 'girls', 'remind', 'Japanese', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'fighting', 'chasing', 'mayham', 'street', 'favorite', 'device', 'Japanimation', 'Urusei', 'Yatsura', 'idea', 'hero/heroine', 'created', 'doctor', 'situation', 'classic', 'anime', 'Astro', 'Boy', 'so', 'course', 'Japanese', 'products', 'owe', 'much', 'American', 'older', 'animations', 'style', 'eye', 'quite', 'closer', 'Japanese', 'counterpart', 'rather', 'Disney', 'Hannah', 'Barbera', 'works', 'might', 'explain', 'other', 'Japanese', 'audience', 'joyful', 'reaction', 'Powerpuff', 'Girls', 'Anyway', 'kids', 'want', 'see', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'edge', 'something', 'spicier', 'Pokemon', 'watching', 'animation', 'try', 'hard', 'not', 'love', 'girls']",N/A

Look at the expectations for the Star Wars films as an example of how anticipation can lead to disappointment. Perhaps that's why I was a bit disappointed with The Powerpuff Girls Movie. The references to Japanese anime are still abundant(and there are great visual references to The Wizard of Oz, Jimmy Durante and vaudville among many others) and the story is still witty but it's really for an older audience of children than the tv show. Nevertheless the film still manages to work on mulitple levels so adults will enjoy this as much as older kids.Any child over the age of 6 or 7 should be able to appreciate the themes of rejection and being ""different"". The way they are utilized throughout the story adds depth to the film. I felt, though, that the film lacked much of the humor and charm of the television series. When the girls hit the big screen, the story takes a far too serious turn early on.Although it's not as perfect as the best episodes of the television series, the movie is a welcome diversion (and escape) from the more adult ""kid"" movies being released around the same time.
