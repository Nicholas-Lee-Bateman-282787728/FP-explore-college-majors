In season five, the show reverts back to color after seasons 2-4 which were in black and white. Though two of Gene's movies in the late 1940's had been filmed using an inferior film process called Cinecolor, all color shows from seasons 1 and 5 of the television series look very good.

This was on CBS in 1955 with 35mm. prints (Sundays at 5 pm. mst.). Here we have 16mm. syndication prints very poorly mastered. 16mm. can be mastered and look really good...I don't know what happened here! The center and right side are sharply focused...the left is out of focus. The prints are well used and show wear. I'm very critical. The $11 price is right and you probably won't be as hard to please as I am. So go BUY IT.,3,Gene Autry in COLOR.
