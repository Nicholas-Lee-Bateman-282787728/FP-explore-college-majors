My copy of this film arrived and it was DVD-R. People on the DVD Bargain Forum are reporting the same problem with new discs from Alpha. The nice thing about Alpha before this was the material may be grade B, but at least you were getting a pressed copy. True no more. Alpha - If you are listening, your public domain material on a burned disc is worth almost exactly a quarter, not seven bucks.",1,Alpha is burning their discs now,1347408000,"09 12, 2012",2012,510,"['Just', 'when', 'thought', 'DVD', 'market', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'worse', 'apparently', 'Alpha', 'burning', 'copies', 'new', 'DVDs', 'copy', 'film', 'arrived', 'was', 'DVD-R.', 'People', 'DVD', 'Bargain', 'Forum', 'are', 'reporting', 'same', 'problem', 'new', 'discs', 'Alpha', 'nice', 'thing', 'Alpha', 'was', 'material', 'may', 'be', 'grade', 'B', 'least', 'were', 'getting', 'pressed', 'copy', 'True', 'more', 'Alpha', 'are', 'listening', 'public', 'domain', 'material', 'burned', 'disc', 'worth', 'almost', 'exactly', 'quarter', 'not', 'seven', 'bucks']",No Hands on the Clock
