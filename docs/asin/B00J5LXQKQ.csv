1695692,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B00J5LXQKQ,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[12, 13]","Written and directed by Ritesh Batra, The Lunchbox (Hindi title ""Dabba"") is a wonderfully intimate film about two lonely people whose disparate lives are accidentally connected by the mis-delivery of a lunchbox.  In the hands of a lesser director, it would've probably been merely a light romantic comedy.  But in Batra's very talented hands, The Lunchbox is much, much more than that, bringing us deeply into the characters' lives and showing how sometimes it's the smallest things that can make the biggest difference.Saajan Fernandes (marvelously played by Irrfan Khan) is a lonely accountant working in the claims department of a company in Mumbai.  Middle-aged and approaching retirement, he exists more than he lives, having lost any feeling for anyone or anything since the death of his wife some years earlier.  Ila (Nimrat Kaur in an equally marvelous performance) is a lonely young wife/mother who lives with her young daughter and emotionally distant husband in an apartment in Mumbai.  Her only real human contact comes from her upstairs neighbor, an older woman, ""Auntie"" Deshpande (Bharati Achrekar), whom we never actually see but who carries on conversations with her through their open windows, chatting about their daily lives and giving advice about cooking.  Wanting desperately to revive some sense of connection with her cold and indifferent husband, Ila tries to prepare special lunches for him, hoping as the old saying goes, to find a way to his heart through his stomach.A chance of fate intervenes when Ila's specially prepared lunch mistakenly ends up being delivered to Saajan's office instead of her husband's.  Although Saajan notices that something seems different about his lunch, he gives the matter little thought.  He does, however, eat all of it, finding it quite delicious, and so when the lunchbox is returned to Ila that afternoon, she is surprised and delighted to find it completely empty, thinking that her husband must have enjoyed it for once.  But when he comes home, he is just as cold and indifferent as ever, and only when she asks about it does he say anything, mentioning that the cauliflower was okay.  Which tells her that something is amiss since the lunch she prepared didn't have any cauliflower.  The next day, she prepares another lunch, this time sending it off with a note inside, telling whoever the lunch gets delivered to that he must've gotten the lunch she had prepared for her husband by mistake, but that she appreciated the fact that he had clearly enjoyed it, judging by the empty returns, and that it made her feel appreciated, if only for a little while.  Reading the note, Saajan is hesitant at first, but afterwards sends back a note that that day's lunch was a bit salty.  Which prompts Ila to fix something spicy for the next lunch - with a new note.  Which prompts Saajan to send back a note about his having to eat a banana to dampen the heat in his mouth from the spice, mentioning off-handedly that he sees that so many people have nothing but a banana for their lunch.  Gradually a correspondence between them builds as they share their observations, their thoughts and eventually their feelings, he about missing the life he had with his wife, she about the life she doesn't have with her husband.There are a number of side-plots occurring in the film, foremost of which are Saajan's having to train an overly eager new-hire Shaikh (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) as his replacement, Ila's having to deal with her father having terminal cancer and her mother's having to take care of him, and Auntie Deshpande's husband who's been in a coma for years. The real importance of these sub-plots is that through them we see how Saajan and Ila are both starting to see the world around them with new eyes, both of them coming alive again, their perspectives changing as a direct result of their chance correspondence. It is to writer/director Batra's immense credit that he imbues his film with a great deal of subtlety, little things like the sound of a particular song, the visual of a ceiling fan, the news of a random tragedy, each seen and reacted to by Saajan and Ila in their separate lives but making the point that they're both in the same world.Another small but delightful detail is how Batra portrays Auntie Deshpande's character.  You never actually see Ila's chatty upstairs neighbor though you hear her voice, hear her changing the music and looking through drawers for things. But you do see this basket she lowers to share cooking ingredients with Ila, and through the way Batra has the basket bob and weave, he gives the audience a visual feel for Auntie Deshpande's personality.  I've never seen a dangling basket that manages to coax, tease, and nudge the way this one did in the film.  An extraordinarily nice touch.Important note: if you're not from India or familiar with the dabbawala system of lunchbox deliveries, I strongly suggest either googling it or looking it up on Wikipedia (from which I derived much of the following description) as it is important to fully understanding the film. It is also something of a fascinating subject in its own right. Started in Mumbai back in 1890, the dabbawala system is a complex, highly organized and remarkably reliable delivery system that collects hot food in lunch boxes (or ""dabbas"") from the residences of workers in the late morning, delivers the lunches to the workplace utilizing various modes of transport, predominantly bicycles and the railway trains, and returns the empty boxes back to the customer's residence that afternoon. They are also made use of by prominent meal suppliers in Mumbai where they ferry ready, cooked meals from central kitchens to the customers and back. The workers who handle the deliveries are ""dabbawalas"".  What is also important to understand is that the chances of a lunchbox being delivered to the wrong place are on the order of once in every eight _million_ deliveries. Which is what makes the key event in ""The Lunchbox"" such a remarkable oddity.In truth I only have two criticisms about the film.  The first is strictly a technical one.  Being an English speaker, I'm dependent on the sub-titles in films to follow what's going on, and I found that the choice of sub-title format in The Lunchbox often made them difficult to read, being very light text against what was frequently a light background.  The other was what I felt was a loss of focus and pacing in the latter part of the film which made it a bit harder to follow what was going on and also felt less intimate than what came before it.But that aside, The Lunchbox is truly something worth seeing, engaging you in a way that too few films ever do and prompting us to think about our own lives and about what really matters to us.Highly recommended.",4,"""Sometimes the wrong train will take you to the right destination.""",1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,6791,"['Written', 'directed', 'Ritesh', 'Batra', 'Lunchbox', 'Hindi', 'Dabba',
