There is still enough action to keep the pace going, but Jackie and Sammo really put their effort into the dramatic scenes.The movie is about a police officer (Jackie) burdened with the responsibility of taking care of his mentally retarded older brother (Sammo). Sammo is accidentally caught up in a robbery and is kidnapped, and Jackie must save the day.The action is good, very good. I really was gobsmacked when Jackie ran up the wall and summersaulted backwards off of it, but the dramatic scenes are just as good. When the theme tune kicks in, the scene is intensified to a point where your eyes feal like somebody is peeling 1000 onions right in front of your face.I think that this is a quality film and that you should buy it.",5,A Quality Film,992736000,"06 17, 2001",2001,825,"['film', 'was', 'Jackies', 'first', 'movie', 'concentrated', 'more', 'drama', 'Action', 'still', 'enough', 'action', 'keep', 'pace', 'going', 'Jackie', 'Sammo', 'really', 'put', 'effort', 'dramatic', 'scenes.The', 'movie', 'police', 'officer', 'Jackie', 'burdened', 'responsibility', 'taking', 'care', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'older', 'brother', 'Sammo', 'Sammo', 'accidentally', 'caught', 'up', 'robbery', 'kidnapped', 'Jackie', 'must', 'save', 'day.The', 'action', 'good', 'very', 'good', 'really', 'was', 'gobsmacked', 'when', 'Jackie', 'ran', 'up', 'wall', 'summersaulted', 'backwards', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'When', 'theme', 'tune', 'kicks', 'scene', 'intensified', 'point', 'where', 'eyes', 'feal', 'somebody', 'peeling', '1000', 'onions', 'right', 'front', 'face.I', 'think', 'quality', 'film', 'should', 'buy']",Heart of Dragon VHS

It is about Jackie and his mentally retarded brother, Sammo.  He pulls it off quite nicely and most of his scenes are evry funny.  So whether you are a kugn fu fan or not, this is at least worth a peek.But let me name you all the stars.  Again they all don't fight, btu it is nice to see them.  But then again, most of them do end up fighing in the 2 bonus fights on the disk, so it's all good.  Here we go-Jackie, Samo, Lam Ching Ying(nice eyebrows), phillip ko(really nice mustache), hoi san lee(36th chamber), wah yuen and hoi meng(hellz windstaff) star and do the stunts, james tien, Hark on-fung(warriors two), Blacky Ko(boxer's adventure), Roy chiao(a touch of zen), corey yuen, Dick Wei(avenging eagle), Wu Ma, Kar lok chin(operation scoprpio),  and conan lee's friend in Ninja in the dragon's den.  I left some people out so play name that old school star while watching this, it is quite fun.I only gave the movie a 3 becasue the movie was a bit cheesy, the haircuts were extra cheesy, and the music had me reaching for the remote a few times.The fox/fortune star release is VERY well done with dual languages and you need the original langualge for this.  In kung fu, dubbing is ok, but in a more serious movie like this, you can't listen to those same, stupid voices.  It is presented in a widescreen format and the pictuer is pretty good.  bonus feature is 2 extra fight scenes.  Which reminds me, I forgot that Chi Ling Chu(kugn fu hustle, snake in eagle's shadow) fights in one of the stupidest fights ever.

Very refreshing to see if you are weary of the comic slapstick of his earlier movies. The english subtitles are far more indepth then the  American verson...

This film really opens  your eyes to how people treat the disabled. I think that Jackie was aiming  for more films like this. Shanghi Noon is another example of what he may  have been trying to do.

Heart Of The Dragon was a brave step for them, a movie that largely eschews action and focuses on drama.  I guess they wanted to prove that there was more to them than best-in-the-world action direction, and here they prove it beyond doubt.  The dramatic performances of both are excellent, and Sammo's direction is wonderful.  It's a really moving story, very well told.Obviously they knew that the fans out there expected action though, so the movie has a few small fights and then a largely unnecessary but brilliantly filmed action finale that lasts a good 20 minutes.  The movie would probably have been just as good without it, but one cannot complain about a 20 minute action scene when such masters of the art were behind it.
