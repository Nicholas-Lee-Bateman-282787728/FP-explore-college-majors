So, for the past 10 years or so I have been looking for it, but I could never recall the title or who was in it. However, I started searching on IMDB.com with some keywords and lo and behold I found it! Much to my surprise it had just been released and I had to get it.Indeed the quality of it is not great, but to be expected for a 70's TV movie. Also, it wasn't as frightening as my memories had held, but nonetheless was still great to watch. Worth watching, especially if you saw it when it was on TV way back then.",4,Haunted me for years!,1205452800,"03 14, 2008",2008,578,"['watched', 'movie', 'kid', 'haunted', 'years', 'So', 'past', '10', 'years', 'so', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'could', 'never', 'recall', 'title', 'who', 'was', 'However', 'started', 'searching', 'IMDB.com', 'keywords', 'lo', 'behold', 'found', 'Much', 'surprise', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'had', 'get', 'it.Indeed', 'quality', 'not', 'great', 'be', 'expected', '70', 'TV', 'movie', 'Also', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'frightening', 'memories', 'had', 'held', 'nonetheless', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'watch', 'Worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'TV', 'way', 'back', 'then']",Crawlspace

I had never heard of the film before, so it was a ""pleasant"" surprise.The movie is truly bizarre as it starts out like a nice little drama (complete with your pretty little music) and turns into something a lot more sinister. It is very difficult to review this movie without giving away half the plot, so let's just say that the acting is good, and the plot is surprising (if somewhat gruesome).The picture quality is not the best, but this was a TV movie back when TV was not Hi-def! This film is cheesy, short, suspenseful and worth your couch time!P.S. Teresa Wright is getting old, but she is still as charming as ever--and the voice hasn't changed at all.
