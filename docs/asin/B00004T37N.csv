550039,A15E01890A5IX5,B00004T37N,Alison Leigh,"[6, 7]","I purchased The Grand-Series One based purely on Amazon.com reviews and its description as I had never heard of it before. I am happy to say that I was totally entranced in the world of The Grand Hotel and its many visitors and residents.The Grand follows the Bannerman family as they reopen their luxury Manchester hotel shortly after WWI. Be prepared for wonderful performances, exciting and unpredictable plots, and gorgeous 1920s era costumes and period decor.The cast is superb and the characters are both complex and interesting. Stephen Moyer who plays Stephen Bannerman is absolutely gorgeous and irresistible in his role; Mark Mcgann as John's mischief-making brother Marcus is similarly excellent. Also, wonderful acting from Tim Healy as the wise, know-it-all porter Mr. Collins, and look for British costume drama veteran Susan Hampshire.The Grand-Series One is a two-disc set, which contains eight episodes, each running around 50 minutes each. The series is addictive and I watched it in its entirety over the course of two days.You won't be disappointed!",5,This was sooo good!,1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,1069,"['purchased', 'Grand-Series', 'One', 'based', 'purely', 'Amazon.com', 'reviews', 'description', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'was', 'totally', 'entranced', 'world', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'many', 'visitors', 'residents.The', 'Grand', 'Bannerman', 'family', 'reopen', 'luxury', 'Manchester', 'hotel', 'shortly', 'WWI', 'Be', 'prepared', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'exciting', 'unpredictable', 'plots', 'gorgeous', '1920s', 'era', 'costumes', 'period', 'decor.The', 'cast', 'superb', 'characters', 'are', 'complex', 'interesting', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'who', 'Stephen', 'Bannerman', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'irresistible', 'role', 'Mark', 'Mcgann', 'John', 'mischief-making', 'brother', 'Marcus', 'similarly', 'excellent', 'Also', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'Tim', 'Healy', 'wise', 'know-it-all', 'porter', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'look', 'British', 'costume', 'drama', 'veteran', 'Susan', 'Hampshire.The', 'Grand-Series', 'One', 'two-disc', 'set', 'eight', 'episodes', 'running', 'around', '50', 'minutes', 'series', 'addictive', 'watched', 'entirety', 'course', 'two', 'days.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

550041,AMUTYOX234D90,B00004T37N,Bill,"[21, 22]","""The Grand"" is certainly addictive -- thanks to the interesting writing and fine performances from all involved. One caveat: Initially, even the villainy is enjoyable, but by the end, the series turns quite dark and disturbing.My personal favorites among the actors: Tim Healy is excellent as the heart of the hotel; interestingly, as his character becomes a bit looser in ""The Grand: Series Two,"" he becomes less affecting. Mark McGann is an extremely interesting villain -- he manages to keep you wondering if, in fact, there are redeeming qualities in the character. He's a scene stealer, but Julia St. John, as his love interest (and his brother's wife), more than holds her own. Rebecca Callard is extremely appealing as one of the hotel servants. Stephen Moyer invests much depth into his character of the former soldier -- it becomes apparent just how much when you view ""The Grand: Series Two,"" where his character is played by another actor of lesser caliber.As others have mentioned, you'll soon be hooked and find it hard to stop watching until you have finished the entire series. And you'll be sure to want to check in again for ""The Grand: Series Two."" But that's the point where you might be somewhat disappointed, and not only because two characters (one mentioned above) are played by different, less-effective actors.In the initial episodes of the second series, the tone seems off. While the first series managed to feel like drama rather than soap opera, the second dives wholeheartedly into the soapsuds and becomes more episodic. Some characters even seem to act in ways inconsistent with their previous actions. It almost feels as if a new production team had taken over, although that's not the case.Luckily, the second series hits its stride with the fourth episode and, for the most part, sustains it until almost the very end (with some nifty surprises and plot twists along the way). There's some very enjoyable writing throughout -- great credit goes to Russell T. Davies for staying true to his period and not trying to impose modern sensibilities on his characters.For example, the character who reveals his gayness is utterly confused and conflicted in a way that seems consistent for an uneducated worker in 1920s Britain; his self-hatred and seemingly unresolvable sense of isolation are never glossed over.By the end of the second series, it becomes clear, though, why there were only two series of ""The Grand."" Just about every avenue of development had been explored and there was little ground left to cover with the characters. So, you check out of The Grand generally satisfied with your stay, but feel fine not returning for another.",4,Check into The Grand,1056931200,"06 30, 2003",2003,2674,"['Grand', 'certainly', 'addictive', 'thanks', 'interesting', 'writing', 'fine', 'performances', 'involved', 'One', 'caveat', 'Initially', 'even', 'villainy', 'enjoyable', 'end', 'series', 'quite', 'dark', 'disturbing.My', 'personal', 'favorites', 'actors', 'Tim', 'Healy', 'excellent', 'heart', 'hotel', 'interestingly', 'character', 'bit', 'looser', 'Grand', 'Series', 'Two', 'less', 'affecting', 'Mark', 'McGann', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'villain', 'keep', 'wondering', 'fact', 'are', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'character', 'scene', 'stealer', 'Julia', 'St.', 'John', 'love', 'interest', 'brother', 'wife', 'more', 'own', 'Rebecca', 'Callard', 'extremely', 'appealing', 'one', 'hotel', 'servants', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'much', 'depth', 'character', 'former', 'soldier', 'apparent', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'when', 'view', 'Grand', 'Series', 'Two', 'where', 'character', 'played', 'actor', 'lesser', 'caliber.As', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', ""'ll"", 'soon', 'be', 'hooked', 'find', 'hard', 'stop', 'watching', 'have', 'finished', 'entire', 'series', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sure', 'want', 'check', 'again', 'Grand', 'Series', 'Two', 'point', 'where', 'might', 'be', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'not', 'only', 'two', 'characters', 'one', 'mentioned', 'are', 'played', 'different', 'less-effective', 'initial', 'episodes', 'second', 'series', 'tone', 'off', 'first', 'series', 'managed', 'feel', 'drama', 'rather', 'soap', 'opera', 'second', 'dives', 'wholeheartedly', 'soapsuds', 'more', 'episodic', 'characters', 'even', 'seem', 'act', 'ways', 'inconsistent', 'previous', 'actions', 'almost', 'new', 'production', 'team', 'had', 'taken', 'over', 'not', 'case.Luckily', 'second', 'series', 'stride', 'fourth', 'episode', 'most', 'part', 'almost', 'very', 'end', 'nifty', 'surprises', 'plot', 'twists', 'way', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'writing', 'great', 'credit', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'staying', 'true', 'period', 'not', 'trying', 'impose', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'characters.For', 'example', 'character', 'who', 'gayness', 'utterly', 'confused', 'conflicted', 'way', 'consistent', 'uneducated', 'worker', '1920s', 'Britain', 'self-hatred', 'seemingly', 'unresolvable', 'sense', 'isolation', 'are', 'never', 'glossed', 'end', 'second', 'series', 'clear', 'though', 'why', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'series', 'Grand', 'Just', 'avenue', 'development', 'had', 'been', 'explored', 'was', 'little', 'ground', 'left', 'cover', 'characters', 'So', 'check', 'Grand', 'generally', 'satisfied', 'stay', 'feel', 'fine', 'not', 'returning']",N/A

550045,ANEDXRFDZDL18,B00004T37N,Serene Night,"[8, 13]","The Grand is an ""Upstairs/Downstairs"" type series, set in 1920's, and revolves around the owners of ""The Grand Hotel,"" their staff, and the hotel guests. Just like Upstairs/Downstairs, social station, the war, and family issues are the hot plot topics for this series. The most sympathetic characters are that of the hotel owner John, Charles' fiancee Ruth, and the servants. My only peeve with the series? That its way too short. There are only 8 episodes in the first season set which makes the price a little steep. Also, Unresolved plot threads... Such as the poor drunk girl who had the 'appendicitis' trouble. I wanted to see the villian in that ep get what he deserved. Unfortunately no resoultion. Also...As usual, the poor folks show much more spine than their snobbish and rich 'patrons,' which was a little predictable.Still, this is an excellent series, sure to delight viewers who also like Upstairs Downstairs.",5,Grand Style,1080172800,"03 25, 2004",2004,924,"['Grand', 'Upstairs/Downstairs', 'type', 'series', 'set', '1920', 'owners', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'staff', 'hotel', 'guests', 'Just', 'Upstairs/Downstairs', 'social', 'station', 'war', 'family', 'issues', 'are', 'hot', 'plot', 'topics', 'series', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'are', 'hotel', 'owner', 'John', 'Charles', 'fiancee', 'Ruth', 'servants', 'only', 'peeve', 'series', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'are', 'only', '8', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'set', 'price', 'little', 'steep', 'Also', 'Unresolved', 'plot', 'threads', 'Such', 'poor', 'drunk', 'girl', 'who', 'had', ""'appendicitis"", 'trouble', 'wanted', 'see', 'villian', 'ep', 'get', 'what', 'deserved', 'Unfortunately', 'resoultion', 'Also', 'usual', 'poor', 'folks', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'spine', 'snobbish', 'rich', ""'patrons"", 'was', 'little', 'predictable.Still', 'excellent', 'series', 'sure', 'delight', 'viewers', 'who', 'also', 'like', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs']",N/A
