Tammy did change over the course of the movie, becoming a more serious and respectful person........and maybe that was the point of the movie........to see Tammy evolve...... too bad we had to watch 1.5 hours of crap to get to see it happen.People walked out of the theater.

1697143,A33NKF3Y0CRGCQ,B00K2CHXQA,Amari Sali,"[1, 3]","Since Bridesmaids, arguably Melissa McCarthy has been one of the funniest comedians period. For not only does she know how to say vulgar and hilarious things, but her style of physical comedy perhaps hasn&#8217;t been seen since maybe when Chris Farley was alive. Unfortunately though, Tammy seems like it maybe one of McCarthy&#8217;s first real disappointments.Characters & StoryImagine getting fired from your job, finding your husband Greg (Nat Faxon) is cheating with your neighbor Missi (Toni Collette), and you no longer have a car to get away from everything. Well, that is how we are introduced to Tammy (Melissa McCarthy). Someone who you don&#8217;t really feel sorry for at first. For on the shallow end of things, Tammy comes off like most of McCarthy&#8217;s characters since Bridesmaids in which she plays what almost seems like the major negative stereotypes of heavyset people. However, as with most of her films, she turns it around by humanizing the character. For this tale, the main one who helps her do so is Tammy&#8217;s grandmother Pearl (Susan Sarandon), as well as Pearl&#8217;s cousin Lenore (Kathy Bates). Together, while Tammy certainly doesn&#8217;t change overnight, they help Tammy face this sorry life she has and try to inspire her to make it better. Even if it requires a road trip from hell.PraiseTo be quite honest, I was surprised at how funny Susan Sarandon could be. Not that I think she is a square, but her acting, at least in movies I&#8217;ve seen her in, never made her seem like she could be consistently funny. But, then again, in the movie she plays an old alcoholic. And while she is nowhere near Betty White&#8217;s level of using her age to make situations funny, she does get quite a few good laughs in, especially when it comes to Pearl having sex with Earl (Gary Cole).As for McCarthy, admittedly the best parts were in the trailer. But, there are still a few moments not in the trailer which will give you a chuckle. For the most part though, it seems like McCarthy, who wrote Tammy with her husband, was more so trying to develop the character than make Tammy someone trying to deliver joke after joke. For while Tammy certainly is a mess, in more ways than one, throughout the film we more so are treated in trying to get to the root of Tammy&#8217;s issues rather than watching McCarthy and Sarandon try to give birth to a Thelma and Louise inspired film.CriticismI must say though, in the pursuit of trying to make her character serious, this leads to a lot of boring moments in which I was checking to see if the film was close to the end of its running time. For one, as noted, the best moments are in the trailer and what is left over will certainly not make you laugh that hard. Also, some of the jokes McCarthy has in the film go on too long and are so bad that I&#8217;d argue they should have been cut.Then, when it comes to the story, it does feel a bit aimless for quite some time, even with us knowing the plan is going to Niagara Falls ultimately. But the true root of the film&#8217;s issues, I feel, are because McCarthy isn&#8217;t at that place yet in her career where she can really, consistently, humanize a character while balancing out the fact they are supposed to be funny. Which perhaps is the main pitfall of McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone writing, and Falcone directing, this film. For when it comes to films McCarthy has been in thus far, you can see that those involved knew how to utilize her talents. But with McCarthy being so close to this film, you can see she is more so giving the people what she thinks they want, while trying to mix in her own ideas into the production. Neither of which turns out well for both the story and jokes were subpar when it comes to what you expect out of McCarthy.Overall: TV ViewingQuite honestly, even though I laughed 35 times, they were all weak Ellen DeGeneres sort of chuckles. It was rare for a joke to not feel like something recycled from McCarthy&#8217;s past movies, and I&#8217;d argue this movie was more so made for people to see the characters she played in the past with more detail than her really looking to write something original. So, with that said, I&#8217;m definitely saying this is a &#8220;TV Viewing&#8221; type film. For not only is it disappointing, but it really does make me question if McCarthy should ever write her own material again.",3,"After a string of quality movies, McCarthy seems to have released a disappointment.",1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,4399,"['Bridesmaids', 'arguably', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'been', 'one', 'funniest', 'comedians', 'period', 'not', 'only', 'know', 'how', 'say', 'vulgar', 'hilarious', 'things', 'style', 'physical', 'comedy', 'perhaps', 'hasn', '8217', 'been', 'seen', 'maybe', 'when', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'was', 'alive', 'Unfortunately', 'Tammy', 'maybe', 'one', 'McCarthy', '8217', 'first', 'real', 'disappointments.Characters', 'StoryImagine', 'getting', 'fired', 'job', 'finding', 'husband', 'Greg', 'Nat', 'Faxon', 'cheating', 'neighbor', 'Missi', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'car', 'get', 'away', 'everything', 'Well', 'how', 'are', 'introduced', 'Tammy', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'Someone', 'who', 'don', '8217', 'really', 'feel', 'sorry', 'first', 'shallow', 'end', 'things', 'Tammy', 'most', 'McCarthy', '8217', 'characters', 'Bridesmaids', 'what', 'almost', 'major', 'negative', 'stereotypes', 'heavyset', 'people', 'However', 'most', 'films', 'around', 'humanizing', 'character', 'tale', 'main', 'one', 'who', 'do', 'so', 'Tammy', '8217', 'Pearl', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'as', 'well', 'Pearl', '8217', 'cousin', 'Lenore', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Together', 'Tammy', 'certainly', '8217', 'change', 'overnight', 'help', 'Tammy', 'face', 'sorry', 'life', 'try', 'inspire', 'make', 'better', 'Even', 'road', 'trip', 'hell.PraiseTo', 'be', 'quite', 'honest', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'funny', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'could', 'be', 'Not', 'think', 'square', 'acting', 'least', 'movies', '8217', 've', 'seen', 'never', 'made', 'seem', 'could', 'be', 'consistently', 'funny', 'then', 'again', 'movie', 'old', 'alcoholic', 'nowhere', 'near', 'Betty', 'White', '8217', 's', 'level', 'using', 'age', 'make', 'situations', 'funny', 'get', 'quite', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'especially', 'when', 'Pearl', 'having', 'sex', 'Earl', 'Gary', 'Cole', '.As', 'McCarthy', 'admittedly', 'best', 'parts', 'were', 'trailer', 'are', 'still', 'few', 'moments', 'not', 'trailer', 'will', 'give', 'chuckle', 'most', 'part', 'McCarthy', 'who', 'wrote', 'Tammy', 'husband', 'was', 'more', 'so', 'trying', 'develop', 'character', 'make', 'Tammy', 'someone', 'trying', 'deliver', 'joke', 'joke', 'Tammy', 'certainly', 'mess', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'film', 'more', 'so', 'are', 'treated', 'trying', 'get', 'root', 'Tammy', '8217', 'issues', 'rather', 'watching', 'McCarthy', 'Sarandon', 'try', 'give', 'birth', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'inspired', 'film.CriticismI', 'must', 'say', 'pursuit', 'trying', 'make', 'character', 'serious', 'lot', 'boring', 'moments', 'was', 'checking', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'close', 'end', 'running', 'time', 'one', 'noted', 'best', 'moments', 'are', 'trailer', 'what', 'left', 'over', 'will', 'certainly', 'not', 'make', 'hard', 'Also', 'jokes', 'McCarthy', 'film', 'go', 'too', 'long', 'are', 'so', 'bad', '8217', 'd', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut.Then', 'when', 'story', 'feel', 'bit', 'aimless', 'quite', 'time', 'even', 'knowing', 'plan', 'going', 'Niagara', 'Falls', 'ultimately', 'true', 'root', 'film', '8217', 'issues', 'feel', 'are', 'McCarthy', 'isn', '8217', 'place', 'yet', 'career', 'where', 'can', 'really', 'consistently', 'humanize', 'character', 'balancing', 'out', 'fact', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'Which', 'perhaps', 'main', 'pitfall', 'McCarthy', 'husband', 'Ben', 'Falcone', 'writing', 'Falcone', 'directing', 'film', 'when', 'films', 'McCarthy', 'been', 'thus', 'far', 'can', 'see', 'involved', 'knew', 'how', 'utilize', 'talents', 'McCarthy', 'being', 'so', 'close', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'more', 'so', 'giving', 'people', 'what', 'want', 'trying', 'mix', 'own', 'ideas', 'production', 'Neither', 'out', 'well', 'story', 'jokes', 'were', 'subpar', 'when', 'what', 'expect', 'McCarthy.Overall', 'TV', 'ViewingQuite', 'honestly', 'even', 'laughed', '35', 'times', 'were', 'weak', 'Ellen', 'DeGeneres', 'sort', 'chuckles', 'was', 'rare', 'joke', 'not', 'feel', 'something', 'recycled', 'McCarthy', '8217', 'movies', '8217', 'argue', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'so', 'made', 'people', 'see', 'characters', 'played', 'past', 'more', 'detail', 'really', 'looking', 'write', 'something', 'original', 'So', 'said', '8217', 'definitely', 'saying', '8220', 'TV', 'Viewing', '8221', 'type', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'disappointing', 'really', 'make', 'question', 'McCarthy', 'should', 'ever', 'write', 'own', 'material', 'again']",N/A
1697144,A3327KH3Z7GZ1F,B00K2CHXQA,"Anthony L. Wallace ""ALW""","[3, 5]","For more of my reviews head over to: www.thescreencave.comFrom Director Ben Falcone comes an adventure comedy as Melissa McCarthy (Tammy) who gets fired form her job and then loses her husband, sets out to love and find herself before it&#8217;s too late. As she travels with her diabetic grandmother on the road to Niagara Falls, Tammy struggles to make ends meet. But when she meets a stranger at a bar, soon she will realize that being happy from within is the key to her success.Going back to Bridesmaids back in 2009, Melissa McCarthy stormed onto the big screen and would go on to be a major hit. After recently being in the movies: The Heat and Identity Thief, McCarthy would make a name for herself for her energetic and zany performances. Only this time she teams up with Susan Surandon, grandma Pearl, to help deal with their ailing issues. Their chemistry was great as was the rest of the cast; including an appearance by Kathy Bates, who has a touching moment with Tammy when things seem to be at their worst.The movie sort of reminds me of a time when Zach Galifianakis did The Hangover, and from the success of it, went on to make Due Date there after. In the film, he was raunchy and unfavorable as the movie progressed. Same can be said here as McCarthy rules the screen but her character is just too unlikeable to begin with. From the time she did Bridesmaids, her character was strange but had a likability to her that was balanced amongst the rest of her companions. It&#8217;s disappointing to see this actress be utilized to the lowest extent because of the amount of talent and enthuse she brings onscreen.Again, bringing up Susan Sarandon and her role in the film was amazing. I really enjoyed her character even with all the baggage she carried in her life. As Tammy and Pearl were on their road trip it almost felt like a Thelma and Louise adventure that brings back memories from back in the day. Tammy&#8217;s mom, Deb, played by Allison Janney was good; however I would have liked to have seen her more.In the end, the film barely has a plot and is driven by McCarthy&#8217;s antics that cheats the movie from having a better story. A great cast is there but aren&#8217;t treated well with the script. There are sporadic moments of laughter and fun that mostly take place in the first half of the film. By the end of the movie it tries to be serious and have a resolution but you never quite get the feel of it.",2,Tammy (2014) Review,1404259200,"07 2, 2014",2014,2439,"['more', 'reviews', 'head', 'www.thescreencave.comFrom', 'Director', 'Ben', 'Falcone', 'adventure', 'comedy', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'Tammy', 'who', 'fired', 'form', 'job', 'then', 'husband', 'out', 'love', 'find', '8217', 's', 'too', 'late', 'diabetic', 'grandmother', 'road', 'Niagara', 'Falls', 'Tammy', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'when', 'stranger', 'bar', 'soon', 'will', 'realize', 'being', 'happy', 'key', 'success.Going', 'back', 'Bridesmaids', 'back', '2009', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'stormed', 'big', 'screen', 'would', 'go', 'be', 'major', 'hit', 'recently', 'being', 'movies', 'Heat', 'Identity', 'Thief', 'McCarthy', 'would', 'make', 'name', 'herself', 'energetic', 'zany', 'performances', 'Only', 'time', 'up', 'Susan', 'Surandon', 'grandma', 'Pearl', 'help', 'deal', 'ailing', 'issues', 'chemistry', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'rest', 'cast', 'including', 'appearance', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'who', 'touching', 'moment', 'Tammy', 'when', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'worst.The', 'movie', 'sort', 'reminds', 'time', 'when', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'did', 'Hangover', 'success', 'went', 'make', 'Due', 'Date', 'film', 'was', 'raunchy', 'unfavorable', 'movie', 'progressed', 'Same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'here', 'McCarthy', 'rules', 'screen', 'character', 'just', 'too', 'unlikeable', 'begin', 'time', 'did', 'Bridesmaids', 'character', 'was', 'strange', 'had', 'likability', 'was', 'balanced', 'rest', 'companions', '8217', 'disappointing', 'see', 'actress', 'be', 'utilized', 'lowest', 'extent', 'amount', 'talent', 'enthuse', 'onscreen.Again', 'bringing', 'up', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'role', 'film', 'was', 'amazing', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'character', 'even', 'baggage', 'carried', 'life', 'Tammy', 'Pearl', 'were', 'road', 'trip', 'almost', 'felt', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'adventure', 'back', 'memories', 'back', 'day', 'Tammy', '8217', 'mom', 'Deb', 'played', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'was', 'good', 'however', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more.In', 'end', 'film', 'barely', 'plot', 'driven', 'McCarthy', '8217', 'antics', 'cheats', 'movie', 'having', 'better', 'story', 'great', 'cast', 'there', 'aren', '8217', 't', 'treated', 'well', 'script', 'are', 'sporadic', 'moments', 'laughter', 'fun', 'mostly', 'take', 'place', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'end', 'movie', 'be', 'serious', 'have', 'resolution', 'never', 'quite', 'get', 'feel']",N/A

There is nowhere for the talented actresses in the film to go with such poor material.I have seen all of McCarthy's stock goofiness before and I LOVE HER.  I'm not bored with her, but this movie looked like a bunch of outtakes on her familiar schtick (delusional sexual confidence, pratfalls and face-plants, potty-mouthed aggressiveness, pop music singsongs, etc), but as a whole, never pulled together.  McCarthy is capable of fine dramatic acting as well .  It is uncomfortable but heart-rending when her hilarious, obnoxious characters dissolve into moments of truth, recognizing how unattractive and delusional they really are. Witness Identity Thief and The Heat, where her raunchy comedic talents are fully on display, but then her character drops the bravado to reveal the misery inside.  But in Tammy, I came for the funny Melissa,  the Melissa of ""Bridesmaids"" who made me choke with laughter and no squirming. I was drawn by the incredible assembly of the some of the best comedic and dramatic actresses in the business. They are totally wasted here, especially the amazing Toni Collette.  I am surprised Sarandon, Janney, Bates and Oh signed on for such a lifeless script.If McCarthy wants to WRITE movie scripts, not just SNL-worthy bits, she has a way to go to hone her craft.

After yet another tantrum, this one deserved, she trudges down the block to  seek solace at her parents' home.  Fortunately, her grandma (Susan Sarandon) is itching to get out of town, too and supplies the funds and a car that runs (though according to Road Trip Movie Law, it will undergo some pretty rough damage on the way to its destination).  Sarandon's character is an alcoholic whose healthy libido often mortifies McCarthy's.  Despite a pretty standard plot, the two actresses have excellent chemistry and make the movie worth watching.  The two's adventures include meeting two handsome guys (played by Gary Cole and Mark Duplass), a stint in jail, a Fourth of July party with Tammy's lesbian aunt (Kathy Bates), who enjoys lighting things on fire, and a fast food robbery, the damage of which is even more amusingly repaired.  On the way to Niagara Falls, both Tammy and her grandma learn a few life lessons, heal some past wounds and even find love.While not Oscar bait, this is a pretty enjoyable summer road trip movie.

In this one, our heroine hits the road with her drunken grandmother. Chaos ensues.Actually, we see a deft touch with this screenplay: real-life couple Ben Falcone and Melissa McCarthy co-wrote this R-rated script (language, alcohol, and sexual innuendos); as a result, it has far more going for it than I expected.Directed by Ben Falcone, we see a star-studded cast:* Melissa McCarthy(""The Heat"") Tammy is a mess. She doesn't like her job and her ""exit interview"" is the most destructive and raucous I've ever seen. Her relationship with both her mother and her grandmother is ""testy"" to say the least and her husband just dodges her verbal barrages.* Allison Janney (""Bad Words"") Deb despairs of her daughter ever completing anything she starts, including her marriage.* Susan Sarandon (""The Big Wedding"") Pearl had always been closer to her granddaughter than Deb, but her parenting left a lot to be desired.

1697150,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B00K2CHXQA,M. Bullions,"[3, 6]","There isn&#8217;t a movie star out there right now who I love more than Melissa McCarthy. Her unique brand of take-no-prisoners comedy can be a truly remarkable thing. But just because an actor is as good as McCarthy is, does that mean that she should start writing her own material? In the case of her latest feature attraction, &#8220;Tammy,&#8221; the answer, unfortunately, is no.Tammy (McCarthy) is a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Her clunker car is totaled because of a suicidal deer, her husband is cheating on her and her nasty boss fires her after being late from work for a totally legitimate reason. Needing to get out of town, and needing a reset button pressed on her life, Tammy embarks on a road trip to who-knows-where with her heavy-drinking grandmother Pearl (Susan Sarandon.)&#34;Tammy&#34; has a pedigree to die for - so many great actresses - McCarthy, Sarandon, Kathy Bates, Toni Collette, Allison Janney, Sandra Oh, and it only uses about half of them. Collette, Oh and Janney have barely anything to do, each of them only appearing in a few scenes, and mainly in thankless roles. Dan Aykroyd, Gary Cole and Mark Duplass also have supporting (mostly thankless) roles.&#34;Tammy&#34; tries to be two kinds of movies - the hilarious over-the-top comedies that McCarthy has become known for, and a soulful, poignant character study. I&#8217;m not going to say this attempt failed, because I truly enjoyed spending time in the world of Tammy&#8217;s character. But I wish it would have stuck to one of those archetypes.The second one. McCarthy&#8217;s great in comedies like &#8220;Bridesmaids&#8221; and &#8220;The Heat,&#8221; but her fanbase, and audiences everywhere, deserve to see that she can be a very good dramatic actress, if the material calls for it. I know she can do it, because she makes the dramatic and sensitive moments in this film work. But the script itself is kind of all over the place.McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone wrote the film. Their effort doesn&#8217;t fail, by any means, but I just wish &#8220;Tammy&#8221; had a better idea of what it wanted to be. Like all of us, Tammy&#8217;s character is full of questions about what the future has in store for her. So, it makes sense for &#8220;Tammy&#8221; to be uneven.There&#8217;s one bit of miscasting that I need to address - Susan Sarandon plays McCarthy&#8217;s grandmother. Sarandon is 24 years older than McCarthy. She&#8217;s game in a gray wig and old age makeup, but one must wonder - was Betty White not available? Sarandon seems like an odd choice, not just because of her age, but because she never really seems comfortable with comedy. McCarthy carries more on her shoulders than she should need to, with a cast this talented. Alas, she guides the movie through occasional narrative bumps in the road effortlessly.In the end, &#8220;Tammy&#8221; is no vanity piece for McCarthy. It&#8217;s half poignant character study and half typical R-rated comedy. It&#8217;s all over the place, but that&#8217;s not a consistent negative. Even with the contrivances of the story, McCarthy is immensely appealing and charismatic all the way through.Grade: B",3,"Uneven, yet enjoyable.

""Oh, man, Melissa McCarthy, that's too bad, she's just doing that same character over and over.""Then the movie was released, and I happened to read the review in my big local daily newspaper, which said, ""If you think 'Tammy' is just Melissa McCarthy doing that same character again, you're wrong. This movie is deep, it's much much more."" I was thrilled! And I'm a writer, and I respect that she and her husband wrote this themselves, so I am glad I was wrong, and I head to the theater!Then the movie played out in front of my eyes, and...Melissa McCarthy is doing ""that same character"" and...it's somehow worse. Because the movie is a mess, just a big mess. And her character is sloppy, disgusting, and unattractive...without the charm and sharp focus of the writing and directing of ""The Bridesmaids,"" just...Melissa McCarthy unguided, grabbing her crotch, closeups of her shoving junk food in her greasy face, swearing, throwing food. Yuck and the worst sin of all in a comedy - unfunny. And she and her husband co-wrote it, and her husband directed it, so she made these choices. Baffling.When Tammy changes from gross, depressed, angry and disgusting to... sweet, introspective, thoughtful and quiet... we have no clue why, or what just happened. The script gives no development to the characters, at all.Susan Sarandon is a caricature of a Little Old Lady. Except when she's not, and she's the limber, gorgeous, woman of a certain age she actually is. Her ""grandma"" character is supposed to be old and sick. I don't know any old sick grandmas who can straight arm a six pack at shoulder level out of a fridge, and clutch it to their chest, pulling a loaded suitcase with the other arm. Sometimes she has a Southernish accent, sometimes not.Mark Duplass plays a love interest of Tammy's, and the mess of a script gives us no earthly reason why a seemingly normal, stable guy would look twice (other than in horror or  sympathy) at Tammy, yet he is very into her. Tammy refers to herself AND HIM as ""messes,"" yet we've seen no hint that he's a mess. He's clean cut, sweet, fit, nicely dressed, polite, taking care of his dad while they are out to dinner, owns a farm, responsible, etc. Mess?As for the rest of the famous cast, other than Kathy Bates, they are wasted in roles where they are given nothing of consequence to say or do.

1697154,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00K2CHXQA,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 1]","I find it interesting that one of the producers of the new film &#8220;Tammy&#8221;, written by Melissa McCarthy and her husband, Ben Falcone, directed by Falcone and starring McCarthy, is Will Ferrell. The career similarities between Ferrell and McCarthy are becoming more apparent with each new film.Tammy (McCarthy), a fast-food restaurant employee, is late again. Her boss (Falcone) is tired of the excuses and fires her. Returning home early, she finds her husband (Nat Faxon) eating dinner with the neighbor (Toni Collette). The betrayal seems to be the last straw and she runs to her mother&#8217;s (Allison Janney) house, which is two doors down, and tries to take her Grandma&#8217;s (Susan Sarandon) car so she can get out of town, start a new life, make something of herself. But Grandma wants to go and has a large wad of cash to help pay their way, so Tammy reluctantly agrees to let her ride along and they set out on a roadtrip. In Louisville, they meet Earl (Gary Cole) and Bobby (Mark Duplass), father and son farmers who are having a drink at the same BBQ joint. Later still, they pay a visit to Lenore (Kathy Bates), a family member who lives with her partner, Susanne (Sandra Oh) in a big house on the lake. They are just in time for the lesbian couple&#8217;s Fourth of July BBQ.Tammy is not a very remarkable or funny character because we have seen McCarthy do this shtick in a number of films already. Each time, the mannerisms and ticks become more annoying because the persona wasn&#8217;t all that memorable to begin with. Tammy is the socially underdeveloped, less intelligent adult woman who needs to find her way in life. Most of McCarthy&#8217;s characters come from the same mold. Abrupt, awkward and inept, we watch her journey to a different level of maturity by the end of each film. You still probably wouldn&#8217;t want to be her friend, but you will be able to see that there is hope for her. This is the same character she played in &#8220;Identity Thief&#8221; with the same story arc, it is similar to McMullins in &#8220;The Heat&#8221;, and similar to her supporting roles in other movies like &#8220;The Hangover III&#8221;. I would say she is being typecast in these movies, but she seems to be jumping at the chance to make them, embracing these roles, collecting the increasing paychecks as she goes. Whi is she letting herself get into this self-created slump?Her two best roles? In &#8220;Mike & Molly&#8221;, she plays a much more well-rounded, more interesting, and funnier character. In &#8220;Bridesmaids&#8221;, she made an impact playing an even-more caricatured version of her stock character &#8211; she had less screen time, so she had to use broader strokes. And these two women couldn&#8217;t be more different. She needs to do more work like this.It is at this point in her career, when each film seems more successful than the last, when every newspaper article sings her praises, when she is in such high demand, that she could be rewriting her playbook and establishing herself as an actress or comedian with greater versatility.For &#8220;Tammy&#8221;, she and her husband produce and co-write the film, her husband directs it, they basically create the film from scratch, sculpting everything about it as a vehicle for McCarthy. When you write the film, you set the groundwork for everyone else. As the writer, &#8220;Tammy&#8221; contains dialogue McCarthy thought she should use. It is a story she thought she should tell. The next &#8216;gatekeeper&#8217; would be the director, Ben Falcone, McCarthy&#8217;s husband. He helped to create the film as a vehicle for his wife. But this vehicle doesn&#8217;t show off her talents, it panders to them. Why waste all of your talents on a film that you have already done? McCarthy and Falcone are responsible, because they are connected to every aspect of the film. It just boggles my mind that they didn&#8217;t take this opportunity and run, preferring to play it safe with this lame excuse of a road-trip comedy.Why did they play it safe? They probably wanted to do what they could to ensure the film was a hit. Safe is better when you are trying to win the weekend box office. Playing a different character would challenge the audience&#8217;s preconceived notion of who and what McCarthy would be and could lead to disappointment. On the flipside, if you are expecting a funny film, you will be disappointed, because the film simply isn&#8217;t. So who wins with &#8220;Tammy&#8221;?No one. Melissa McCarthy will be able to play this role a few more times before someone says &#8220;Enough&#8221; and she is forced to try something else. Hopefully, at that point, the work she does will begin to surprise and excite people, rather than bore them to death.But there is a bigger problem at work in &#8220;Tammy&#8221;. When Dan Aykroyd, Allison Janney, Nat Faxon, Toni Collette and Mark Duplass all play supporting roles in a comedy, you would expect some of them to be funny. Yet not one of them has a funny line. ALLISON JANNEY does not have any funny lines? She is always funny. Clearly all of the effort was spent on sequences involving Tammy and a deer, Tammy on a water ski, that type of thing. And by proximity, you might expect Grandma (Sarandon) to have something funny to do, because she is right next to Tammy, the star of the show, throughout most of the film. But her character seems confused &#8211; is she supposed to be the outrageous, sexually unrestrained granny or is she supposed to be the voice of reason to Tammy&#8217;s outrageousness? She is both and neither works.Will Ferrell had an extremely long run playing the same character and collecting a huge paycheck every time - &#8220;Blades of Glory&#8221;, &#8220;Semi-Pro&#8221;, &#8220;Step Brothers&#8221;, &#8220;Talladega Nights&#8221;, &#8220;Anchorman&#8221;.  In each, Farrell essentially plays the same guy, a down-on-his-luck guy who loses/ quits his job forcing him to rediscover something about the inner man-boy he has spent his life catering to. Sound familiar? Yes. McCarthy&#8217;s Tammy is essentially a female version of the same character. Ferrell, like Jim Carrey before him, and Robin Williams before him, enjoyed a long run until the films started to sputter and fail at the box office, forcing them all to look to new venues, new characters, smaller paychecks, but more interesting work. McCarthy seems destined to follow this same path, in no small part to people like Farrell who hand her large paychecks to play the same character.

1697155,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B00K2CHXQA,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[5, 7]","In the few years since Bridesmaids catapulted her to stardom with a surprising Best Supporting Actress nomination, Melissa McCarthy has made the absolute best of it. Always a funny and talented actress relegated to supporting roles, she's now having projects designed specifically for her and they've all been huge hits thus far. But Tammy is her first chance to indulge in a true passion project, one she's been developing for years with her co-writer and director husband, Ben Falcone. Essentially a road movie it gives McCarthy the chance to do pretty much the exact same thing she's been doing in exactly the same way, and it makes one wonder why this was such a big deal project for her in the first place.Maybe a good place to start is the titular character, a lumbering tangled mess of sorrow and rage, like so much of what McCarthy has done before. Was there not even a hint of desire to do something....new? Different? Tammy is suffering one of those abysmal days that often launch this type of comedy of the spirit, one we know will end with insights and epiphanies galore. Having lost her terrible job at a fast food joint (Falcone plays her overbearing boss) because she was late after hitting a deer in the road and totaling the car, Tammy comes home to find her husband (Nat Faxon) having an affair with the neighbor (Toni Collette, given zero to do). Basically everything that can go wrong does can wrong, so trudging over to her parents' (Allison Janney and Dan Akroyd) home, which is like one door down and was probably meant to be a joke but isn't funny, Tammy just wants to get out of town. Fortunately, so does her boozing grandmother Pearl (Susan Sarandon), and with a wad of cash and grandma's car they decide to hit the road for a journey both literal and emotional.By this point Tammy has probably fallen flat on her face, crashed into something, or caused some sort of wreckage at least a dozen times until it becomes obvious this is the extent of the humor, and it grows tiresome very fast. Maybe it's the relative inexperience of Falcone as a director and the pair as writers but they do a terrible job of sketching out Tammy's world and the relationships she shares. What they do is portray Tammy as something of a half-wit who hasn't heard of Mark Twain and lacks any shred of social grace. She's mean, aggressive, and generally disagreeable to the point that it's hard to feel anything for her, and the script isn't crafted well enough to change our perception of Tammy no matter how hard it tries. So what we get is essentially lip service to a troubled upbringing, and some brief altercations with Pearl that hint at something deeper. But there's no commitment to any of it, in favor of getting to the next ridiculous set piece where McCarthy can pull whatever stunt she can think of. She's a funny lady but with only Sarandon to play off of you can sense McCarthy struggling to come up with something to do that might get a laugh. So we get numerous overlong and laugh-free scenes where McCarthy labors to kill time: one in which she sings nearly all of the Allman Brothers' &#34;Midnight Rider&#34;, and another where she dances unprovoked to hip-hop because....well, that's never really made clear. It just kind of happens. That's probably the best way to sum up Tammy as a whole: it just kind of happens.By the time a love interest is introduced (played by the utterly wasted Mark Duplass), it feels like an afterthought and considering his character's lack of personality it probably was. We're at a loss to figure out what Tammy's drive or motivation is meant to be, and any lessons learned only come when, you guessed it, after the slovenly Tammy gets a physical makeover. Even as she gets some hard words of wisdom from her lesbian aunt (Kathy Bates), it never really registers as meaningful because Tammy just goes on doing what she's been doing, which makes us wonder what this was about other than lazy and predictable slapstick. If you guessed there might be a stint in jail for Tammy at one point then you are a winner!So what was the draw for McCarthy to do a movie like Tammy in the first place? Obviously there's an appeal to developing her own movie when Hollywood isn't always so forthcoming, but there's a real missed opportunity here for McCarthy to show what she's really capable of.",1,McCarthy Wrote This Crap for Herself!?!?,1404345600,"07 3, 2014",2014,4336,"['few', 'years', 'Bridesmaids', 'catapulted', 'stardom', 'surprising', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'nomination', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'made', 'absolute', 'best', 'funny', 'talented', 'actress', 'relegated', 'supporting', 'roles', 'now', 'having', 'projects', 'designed', 'specifically', ""'ve"", 'been', 'huge', 'hits', 'thus', 'far', 'Tammy', 'first', 'chance', 'indulge', 'true', 'passion', 'project', 'one', 'been', 'developing', 'years', 'co-writer', 'director', 'husband', 'Ben', 'Falcone', 'Essentially', 'road', 'movie', 'McCarthy', 'chance', 'do', 'pretty', 'much', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'been', 'doing', 'exactly', 'same', 'way', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'such', 'big', 'deal', 'project', 'first', 'place.Maybe', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'titular', 'character', 'lumbering', 'tangled', 'mess', 'sorrow', 'rage', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'McCarthy', 'done', 'before', 'Was', 'not', 'even', 'hint', 'desire', 'do', 'something', '.new', 'Different', 'Tammy', 'suffering', 'one', 'abysmal', 'days', 'often', 'type', 'comedy', 'spirit', 'one', 'know', 'will', 'end', 'insights', 'epiphanies', 'galore', 'Having', 'lost', 'terrible', 'job', 'fast', 'food', 'joint', 'Falcone', 'overbearing', 'boss', 'was', 'late', 'hitting', 'deer', 'road', 'totaling', 'car', 'Tammy', 'home', 'find', 'husband', 'Nat', 'Faxon', 'having', 'affair', 'neighbor', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'given', 'zero', 'do', 'Basically', 'everything', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'can', 'wrong', 'trudging', 'parents', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Dan', 'Akroyd', 'home', 'one', 'door', 'down', 'was', 'probably', 'meant', 'be', 'joke', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Tammy', 'just', 'get', 'town', 'Fortunately', 'so', 'boozing', 'grandmother', 'Pearl', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'wad', 'cash', 'grandma', 'car', 'decide', 'hit', 'road', 'journey', 'literal', 'emotional.By', 'point', 'Tammy', 'probably', 'fallen', 'flat', 'face', 'crashed', 'something', 'caused', 'sort', 'wreckage', 'least', 'dozen', 'times', 'obvious', 'extent', 'humor', 'tiresome', 'very', 'fast', 'Maybe', 'relative', 'inexperience', 'Falcone', 'director', 'pair', 'writers', 'do', 'terrible', 'job', 'sketching', 'out', 'Tammy', 'world', 'relationships', 'shares', 'What', 'do', 'portray', 'Tammy', 'something', 'half-wit', 'who', ""n't"", 'heard', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'shred', 'social', 'grace', 'mean', 'aggressive', 'generally', 'disagreeable', 'point', 'hard', 'feel', 'anything', 'script', ""n't"", 'crafted', 'well', 'enough', 'change', 'perception', 'Tammy', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'So', 'what', 'get', 'essentially', 'lip', 'service', 'troubled', 'upbringing', 'brief', 'altercations', 'Pearl', 'hint', 'something', 'deeper', 'commitment', 'favor', 'getting', 'next', 'ridiculous', 'set', 'piece', 'where', 'McCarthy', 'can', 'pull', 'stunt', 'can', 'think', 'funny', 'lady', 'only', 'Sarandon', 'play', 'can', 'sense', 'McCarthy', 'struggling', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'do', 'might', 'get', 'laugh', 'get', 'numerous', 'overlong', 'laugh-free', 'scenes', 'where', 'McCarthy', 'kill', 'time', 'one', 'nearly', 'Allman', 'Brothers', '34', 'Midnight', 'Rider', '34', 'where', 'unprovoked', 'hip-hop', '.well', 'never', 'really', 'made', 'clear', 'just', 'kind', 'happens', 'probably', 'best', 'way', 'sum', 'up', 'Tammy', 'whole', 'just', 'kind', 'happens.By', 'time', 'love', 'interest', 'introduced', 'played', 'utterly', 'wasted', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'afterthought', 'considering', 'character', 'lack', 'personality', 'probably', 'was', ""'re"", 'loss', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'Tammy', 'drive', 'motivation', 'meant', 'be', 'lessons', 'learned', 'only', 'come', 'when', 'guessed', 'slovenly', 'Tammy', 'physical', 'makeover', 'Even', 'hard', 'words', 'wisdom', 'lesbian', 'aunt', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'never', 'really', 'registers', 'meaningful', 'Tammy', 'just', 'doing', 'what', 'been', 'doing', 'wonder', 'what', 'was', 'other', 'lazy', 'predictable', 'slapstick', 'guessed', 'might', 'be', 'stint', 'jail', 'Tammy', 'one', 'point', 'then', 'are', 'winner', 'what', 'was', 'draw', 'McCarthy', 'do', 'movie', 'Tammy', 'first', 'place', 'Obviously', 'appeal', 'developing', 'own', 'movie', 'when', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'always', 'so', 'forthcoming', 'real', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'here', 'McCarthy', 'show', 'what', 'really', 'capable']",N/A
