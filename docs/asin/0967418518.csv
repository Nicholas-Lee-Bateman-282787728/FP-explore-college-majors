167389,A1K5DUV1L52MUD,0967418518,"Bonnie Sayers ""autismfamily""","[15, 15]","The story starts off on Christmas Eve where the legend began. Santa Claus gives the animals of the barn voices for twenty four hours. Annabelle arrives this first night as shown on the video. Santa leaves a note for Billy that the calf is his Christmas present.Billy has been unable to talk since the fire in the barn that left him in the care of his grandfather. His Aunt is the sister to his father, from what I can tell. It is love at first sight for Annabelle and Billy and off they go to play in the snow. Agnes brings Charles, the grandfather imported bon bon's from Paris for his present. Agnes and Charles go into the barn to see what Billy got from Santa Claus.The funniest part of the movie is when Agnes steps in ""kaka"" and the way she says it is hysterical. They proceed back to the house and Billy is left alone in the barn. Well this is the first time Billy has wanted to stay in the barn since the tragic fire. His Aunt Agnes prefers to call him William and the clothes she wears are bright orange and go with her hair.Annabelle makes the mistake of talking in front of Billy and the animals decide it is okay for only Billy to know about the secret that comes once a year from Santa Claus. Annabelle decides she wants to be a reindeer and be with Santa Claus. She tells Billy her dream.There is a song by Randy Travis about changing seasons and making friends. Tears come to my eyes everytime I see the scenes with the song that show Billy, Annabelle and Emily, while Randy sings about seasons come and seasons go.There are many lessons in this fine movie. The two neighbor boys apologize for making up stories. Gus meets Agnes and they seem made for each other. Grandpa gets his music box back, the animals get their yearly treat.The animation and music are such added bonuses as well as the voices that I do not get to hear on sitcoms anymore. The most important thing to remember is to keep this movie in an active collection and not to be utilized only for the holiday season.",5,If You Believe in Yourself,1098230400,"10 20, 2004",2004,1996,"['story', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'where', 'legend', 'began', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'animals', 'barn', 'voices', 'twenty', 'four', 'hours', 'Annabelle', 'first', 'night', 'shown', 'video', 'Santa', 'note', 'Billy', 'calf', 'Christmas', 'present.Billy', 'been', 'unable', 'talk', 'fire', 'barn', 'left', 'care', 'grandfather', 'Aunt', 'sister', 'father', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Annabelle', 'Billy', 'go', 'play', 'snow', 'Agnes', 'Charles', 'grandfather', 'imported', 'bon', 'Paris', 'present', 'Agnes', 'Charles', 'go', 'barn', 'see', 'what', 'Billy', 'got', 'Santa', 'Claus.The', 'funniest', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'Agnes', 'kaka', 'way', 'hysterical', 'proceed', 'back', 'house', 'Billy', 'left', 'alone', 'barn', 'Well', 'first', 'time', 'Billy', 'wanted', 'stay', 'barn', 'tragic', 'fire', 'Aunt', 'Agnes', 'prefers', 'call', 'William', 'clothes', 'wears', 'are', 'bright', 'orange', 'go', 'hair.Annabelle', 'mistake', 'talking', 'front', 'Billy', 'animals', 'decide', 'okay', 'only', 'Billy', 'know', 'secret', 'once', 'year', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Annabelle', 'be', 'reindeer', 'be', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Billy', 'dream.There', 'song', 'Randy', 'Travis', 'changing', 'seasons', 'making', 'friends', 'Tears', 'come', 'eyes', 'everytime', 'see', 'scenes', 'song', 'show', 'Billy', 'Annabelle', 'Emily', 'Randy', 'sings', 'seasons', 'come', 'seasons', 'are', 'many', 'lessons', 'fine', 'movie', 'two', 'neighbor', 'boys', 'apologize', 'making', 'up', 'stories', 'Gus', 'Agnes', 'seem', 'made', 'other', 'Grandpa', 'music', 'box', 'back', 'animals', 'get', 'yearly', 'treat.The', 'animation', 'music', 'are', 'such', 'added', 'bonuses', 'as', 'well', 'voices', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'hear', 'sitcoms', 'anymore', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'remember', 'keep', 'movie', 'active', 'collection', 'not', 'be', 'utilized', 'only', 'holiday', 'season']",Annabelle's Wish VHS
