Starts off with a warm-up, climbing hills, lunges (done with the pace turned down), lunges with a back leg lift, weights are used, and it has a good cool down. No running. For me, this is a keeper.",5,Good workout,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,320,"['really', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'workout', 'are', 'segment', 'changes', '30', '45', '60', 'seconds', 'getting', 'bored', 'warm-up', 'climbing', 'hills', 'lunges', 'done', 'pace', 'turned', 'down', 'back', 'leg', 'lift', 'weights', 'are', 'used', 'good', 'cool', 'down', 'running', 'keeper']",Walking Strong

Well, yes, if you are doing the non-treadmill option, you won't get much of a workout I'm afraid.  That said,  it is essentially a treadmill workout and, as such, it is phenomenal.  My heart rate was at rates I normally achieve with running only (150-160, near my peak fat burning and cardio endurance rates).  And to answer said reviewer, why do free weights on the treadmill - it increases your heart rate/exertion by 12% - which is what helps in fat burning.  In any event, I use the treadmill for my C25K program, and I occasionally fall of the wagon or need a break, I have bad knees...this is the perfect way not to lose progress in my fitness goals in the meantime. I also suggest a Surfshelf if you don't have your treadmill in front of the TV, I put my Polaroid DVD player on it and play this video...works great (also bought at Amazon).

Broken into eleven five-minute segments, Fit By Tracey: Walking Strong varies one's walking routine by alternating between cardio walks and strength walks (with resistance training). Certified personal trainer Tracey Staehle guides the viewer with clear narration and a demonstration of the advanced version of her treadmill workout, while her sister Bobbi demonstrates a less intense version on the treadmill. Their friend Jill demonstrates the workout on the floor without a treadmill. Inexpensive lightweight dumbbells are recommended to get the most out of exercising to Fit By Tracey: Walking Strong. A superb exercise video especially for the elderly, people recovering from severe illness or surgery, or anyone who needs a good workout but can't put excessive strain on their joints by jumping.

Just jump on your treadmill and she has you doing squats, sideways lunges, upper body with dumbbells and max out the incline for great cardio! I loved it!
