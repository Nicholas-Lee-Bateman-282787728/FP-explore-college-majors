71034,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,0783241909,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[8, 8]","The direction, cinematography, casting and performances **top notch**. Ang Lee is one the finest drama film directors working today. His credits include ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"", which are both amazing films if you've not seen them. I gather from folks ""Ride with Devil"" managed to be a pretty accurate depiction of the reality of the Civil War in Missouri. Hollywood has a long, LONG list of movies that are absurdly inaccurate in their portrayal of the Civil War. Of course Hollywood usually carelessly gets historic events it depicts wrong. But not here. War is hell. War is war and it's horrible. But it might be true that civil war is the most devastating in that families and neighbors are often ripped apart and pitted against one another in what amounts to a blood feud. This is what happened throughout the country, especially boarder states and Missouri was one of the worst. What makes the film work so well is that it is a personal depiction of the day to day realities of the war mainly through Tobey Maguire's character (Jake Roedel). He fights with the bushwhackers against the Unionists. I found somewhat touching the interesting position of a former slave named Holt played by the incredible Jeffrey Wright (one of my favorite actors. He's good.) Holt and Jake become friends and Holt fights right along with the anti-Unionists. Things really did get complicated. Well I'll by pass detailing the whole plot, but it is straightforward enough. Just check it out. Good movie.

71035,A3BHHSORGTDW8K,0783241909,A customer,"[1, 1]","....he's going to want to drive (spoilerless review)Who is the devil being ridden with here?  Ostensibly it is the ""Confederate officer"" William Clarke Quantrill, who led a group of rag-tag marauders on horseback during the infamous civilian massacre at Lawrence, Kansas in 1863. Labeled as a psychopath by the north and ""the bloodiest man in American history"", Quantrill and the massacre serve mostly as historical backdrop here. The real devil in the film is the darkness that lurks in the hearts of all men, a darkness that too easily slips into a fiery stampede of torment, anger, and retribution during times of war.While many films tackle the ""brother vs. brother"" aspect of the civil war, Ride goes further by putting its two main protagonists on the wrong side of the tracks.  Tobey Maguire plays the son of Dutch-German immigrants who are solidly on the side of the federal government/abolitionists, and excellent Jeffrey Wright (Felix from Casino Royale) plays an ex-slave.  Both are however fighting on the side of the southern allied ""Bushwhackers"", instead of the northern ""Jayhawkers"" in the Missouri-Kansas border wars.  Told not from the perspective of great generals or men of power, the two are helplessly thrust into the madness taking place around them and have to choose sides (and actions) as best they can under circumstances where there is right and wrong down all paths.Despite the mostly positive reviews on Amazon, this movie was mostly panned by critics in 1999.  I'm not sure why, it is one of the best civil war movies I've seen as it has a good cast, great writing, and superb cinemaphotography. Musician turned actress Jewell is perhaps the only performance that is sometimes lacking, but in her defense most of the women in the movie were portrayed somewhat as mere bystanders in the war. And in many ways they were, and her role is mostly as a potential foil vs. life during wartime. An excellent cast includes Skeet Ulrich (TV's Jericho), Simon Baker (TV's The Mentalist), James Caviezel (Thin Red Line), and many more, including Jonathan Rhys Meyers (TV's Dracula) in a performance that makes you hate an actor more than you've hated another human being in a very long time.  There is plenty of action and violence here, but the main emphasis of the movie is about Mcguire coming of age during war and living with the choices he has made along the way, trying to preserve a nominal sense of decency as he fights alongside friends who can be just as evil as the ""enemy"". In many ways the film takes the more well known story of Quantrill, who grew up in Ohio and started the war as a union ally before becoming a southern guerilla war leader, but tells it through the eyes of one of the millions of unknown and forgotten men who serve as both the essential core and fodder of all military conflicts.A ""director's cut"" (I have not seen the theatrical version), the bluray extras are not outstanding, but do feature some interesting commentary soundtracks and an interview with Jeffrey Wright.  At almost two and a half hours some may find it long, but I never did and in retrospect there is very little that could be cut. Great picture and sound, 4.8 out of 5 stars.",5,If you're gonna ride with the Devil....

The Kansas raid has added footage this time, some of it important really to the story. This version includes a previously omitted scene near the beginning at the woman's farmhouse who feeds them that includes her son hiding in the barn, injured fighting for the Confederates. It clearly conveys the disdain the Confederate soldiers had for the bushwackers. When George Clyde and company take the Ruffalo character and three Union soldiers hostage, and they receive no answer to their demand to release some Southern men, Pitt, Clyde and their leader take revenge on the three remaining hostages--omitted from the earlier film.  At the beginning of the film, when Jake and the bushwackers destroy the roadside store which serves Union soldiers, Jake--in the original film--writes Jack Bull's mother. That scene is omitted from this version entirely.  Music is also changed, unfortunately; most notably, the music is omitted in the Criterion version when Dutchie reads the Union letter from a mother to all of the men after Pitt challenges him to do so. Due to omitted music in this version in two or three places, I did later purchase the shorter, original version of this film. Both versions have their plusses and minuses.  And if you want to know from Ang Lee why Dutchie does NOT shoot Pitt at the end, you won't learn it here. Lee leaves that deliberately open to the viewer to decide (although I think his screenwriter DOES give his opinion in the commentary).

The film has a great cast- Skeet Ulrich,  Tobey Maguire, Jewel, Jeffrey Wright, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Simon Baker,  all of them turning out great performances.I tend to think of this as a  drama more than a war film.  But the actions scenes are great.  there are  some brilliant scenes involving horses that go so smoothly.  and if you  have 5.1 speakers, the sound is great when it comes to the shooting  scenes!I did not know what to expect from Jewel.  I did not know if I  was going to overlook her acting abilities(or lack of)being the fan that I  am, but I did not have to worry.  She did a great job, especially for her  first time.  The ending sort of disappointed me.  I can understand Holt  riding off, but ending it there?  I expected some follow up between Jake  and Sue Lee, then them riding off.  Oh wellAs for DVD extras, there  weren't too many in that department.

It is one of the few movies which takes you into its period world so effortlessly.  It shows the true violence of the time and yet shows how that violence affected people and changed their lives.  Ride with the Devil was directed by Ang Lee, who brought us the brilliant Sense and Sensibility, this is his best work since Sense and Sensibility.  Lee knows how to make a period drama come alive to the viewer in a way that few directors can do.  Maybe its because he usually does projects he really feels for.  The acting in Ride with the Devil was supuerb.  Tobey Maguire again proves that he is the most talented young actor in Hollywood, today. He protrays a a first generation american,Jake Rodell, with such heart and sincerity, very few actors could have done that. Skeet Ulrich delivers his best and most seriuos performance to date, as Jack Bull. Singer, Jewel, gives a suprisingly good and nuanced performance as Sue Lee Shelley.  Jefferey Wright, protrays a freed black with real integrity and authority.  Wright and Maguire were horrible oversights at the Oscars. Actually, i thought the whole movie was a horrible oversight. They brought a whole differnet level to this movie with their performances.  they made you see their characters in a way that few could have done.  You truely cared what happened to them as if they were a close freind.  Wright and Maguire made you see the Civil War not as north and south but as people defending the only life they had ever known.  Ride with the Devil is a captivating movie that goes right to your heart and helps you to understand a time in America's history, when nothing was simple and everything was a battle--Freedom, your way of life and survival.  it puts a new persepective on a war with split our nation in two and hurt everyone it touched.  this movie will probably never get a big following but for those of you reading this you will not be disapointed.  so go rent this movie or be like me and buy it.  thank you Ang lee and everyone how helped make this magnificent movie!",5,An Astounding movie wich was shamfully overlooked!,970876800,"10 7, 2000",2000,2120,"['Ride', 'Devil', 'civil', 'war', 'drama', 'kansas/Missuori', 'buskwackers', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'period', 'world', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'true', 'violence', 'time', 'yet', 'how', 'violence', 'affected', 'people', 'changed', 'lives', 'Ride', 'Devil', 'was', 'directed', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'who', 'brought', 'brilliant', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'best', 'work', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Lee', 'how', 'make', 'period', 'drama', 'come', 'alive', 'viewer', 'way', 'few', 'directors', 'can', 'do', 'Maybe', 'usually', 'projects', 'really', 'acting', 'Ride', 'Devil', 'was', 'supuerb', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'again', 'most', 'talented', 'young', 'actor', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'first', 'generation', 'american', 'Jake', 'Rodell', 'such', 'heart', 'sincerity', 'very', 'few', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Skeet', 'Ulrich', 'best', 'most', 'seriuos', 'performance', 'date', 'Jack', 'Bull', 'Singer', 'Jewel', 'suprisingly', 'good', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Sue', 'Lee', 'Shelley', 'Jefferey', 'Wright', 'freed', 'black', 'real', 'integrity', 'authority', 'Wright', 'Maguire', 'were', 'horrible', 'oversights', 'Oscars', 'Actually', 'i', 'thought', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'horrible', 'oversight', 'brought', 'whole', 'differnet', 'level', 'movie', 'performances', 'made', 'see', 'characters', 'way', 'few', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'truely', 'cared', 'what', 'happened', 'were', 'close', 'freind', 'Wright', 'Maguire', 'made', 'see', 'Civil', 'War', 'not', 'north', 'south', 'people', 'defending', 'only', 'life', 'had', 'ever', 'known', 'Ride', 'Devil', 'captivating', 'movie', 'right', 'heart', 'understand', 'time', 'America', 'history', 'when', 'nothing', 'was', 'simple', 'everything', 'was', 'battle', 'Freedom', 'way', 'life', 'survival', 'new', 'persepective', 'war', 'split', 'nation', 'two', 'hurt', 'everyone', 'touched', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'get', 'big', 'following', 'reading', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disapointed', 'so', 'go', 'rent', 'movie', 'be', 'buy', 'thank', 'Ang', 'lee', 'everyone', 'how', 'helped', 'make', 'magnificent', 'movie']",N/A

The plot, setting, cimematography, and characters were all well done and were the strength of the movie. It had it's drawbacks, but the movie was so strong (for those who enjoy Westerns) that it carried them along to a successful conclusion regardless.Ride with the Devil could have been great, an epic. Some of the reviewers thought it was, but it didn't get there for me. I'm judging this movie by a higher standard because it had all the elements of an epic, but it stumbled in several ways. It was so good and at times so interesting, that it left me slightly disappointed that it didn't reach it's full potential.The strengths were the sweeping epic plot, many of the performances that captured the rebellious spirit of the men involved, the battle scenes, etc. For those of us who love Westerns, these were all very well done and satisfying.The drawbacks were Tobey MacGuire (who I couldn't warm up to in this role), some of the dialogue, and some minor plot issues. Also, somehow, the movie seemed to disengage at times, sort of lulled you to sleep, before resuming it's progress.Although, in my opinion, Ride with the Devil never reached it's potential, it is still very enjoyable and much better than most movies you'll ever see, and certainly well worth a watch.",4,Flawed but Enjoyable,1327017600,"01 20, 2012",2012,1346,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'alot', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'scale', 'plot', 'setting', 'cimematography', 'characters', 'were', 'all', 'well', 'done', 'were', 'strength', 'movie', 'had', 'drawbacks', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'strong', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Westerns', 'carried', 'along', 'successful', 'conclusion', 'regardless.Ride', 'Devil', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'epic', 'reviewers', 'thought', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'there', ""'m"", 'judging', 'movie', 'higher', 'standard', 'had', 'elements', 'epic', 'stumbled', 'several', 'ways', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'times', 'so', 'interesting', 'left', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'reach', 'full', 'potential.The', 'strengths', 'were', 'sweeping', 'epic', 'plot', 'many', 'performances', 'captured', 'rebellious', 'spirit', 'men', 'involved', 'battle', 'scenes', 'etc', 'who', 'love', 'Westerns', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'satisfying.The', 'drawbacks', 'were', 'Tobey', 'MacGuire', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'warm', 'up', 'role', 'dialogue', 'minor', 'plot', 'issues', 'Also', 'somehow', 'movie', 'seemed', 'disengage', 'times', 'sort', 'lulled', 'sleep', 'resuming', 'progress.Although', 'opinion', 'Ride', 'Devil', 'never', 'reached', 'potential', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'certainly', 'well', 'watch']",N/A

It tells the story of several young people coming into adulthood during a profoundly unsettling time. I found it touching, well-crafted by director Ang Lee and his production crew, and graceful.The cast, with Tobey McGuire, Jewel, Simon Baker, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and James Caviezel is terrific. Its themes include love, friendship, duty, honor, character, and vengeance. Similar in some aspects to The Outlaw Josey Wales, RWTD is more authentic than many better known Civil War films. Its locations and music are bonuses, putting this movie over the top. The scene with Jake Roedel (McGuire) reading the Yankee letter around the campfire is among the most touching, thought-provoking scenes in any war movie.It is an unflinching look at misery, hardships, and naked brutality on both sides. RWTD is ""not simply a war movie, according to director Lee, ""It's more about the love and friendships that take place during a war. The film is both big and small, epic and domestic.""

71049,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,0783241909,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[6, 20]","Technically, the film does has moments of real power, such as when Roedel is forced to read the intercepted letters of Northern soldiers' families. But, there is far too little of this. While the set design and costuming are spot on, the film's cinematography, by Frederick Elmes (longtime collaborator with director Jim Jarmusch), is mostly static, content to allow the scenery alone to carry the image, rather than framing it interestingly. The film's score, by Mychael Danna, is likewise rather inert, neither detracting nor adding to the images. Schamus's script has been assailed for its supposed archaic sounding dialogue (which, if one reads the Civil War era letters extant, is no problem), but it's mostly in synch with then contemporaneous idioms, and one wonders why those detractors don't rip into the bloat of so many scenes, and the length of the film, rather than the dialogue. While Jewel and Wright give performances that underwhelm (see the many scenes with Baker's character, the man who saved his life, and defends him from others' racism), and Meyers' dominates every scene he is in, the rest of the main cast- Maguire, Baker, and Caviezel- are, at best, adequate. Maguire's natural sunny disposition ill serves him as Roedel, whereas Baker's character often devolves into a plot device supposed to give the audience an `in' to Wright's Holt, but Holt's own stolid performance never allows Baker's Clyde to shine. Caviezel's Black John is little more than a glorified cameo. Meyers' Mackeson, who looks uncannily like stoner actor Jason Mewes, from Kevin Smith's New Jersey films, is the only part of this film, as mentioned, that works repeatedly, and does so on all levels- from his fey glam rock type mannerisms to his Southern accent (the actor is British)- for I have known people who truly had that psychopathic gleam in their eyes. Meyers captures it perfectly, but he also captures moments that go beyond the diegetic borders of the screenplay. There are two scenes in the film, both where he is offered food and drink in the presence of a woman, where his eyes reveal a warmth unseen in other moments- the first when the Bushwhackers get food from a local farmer's wife, and the second in his last encounter with Roedel and Sue Lee. The fact that we see vulnerability and humanity in a character that is otherwise psychopathic, raises the character above most off the rack `evil' characters in film.The DVD, soon to be released by The Criterion Collection, is in a single disk package, with the film shown in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Extras include an insert booklet with essays by critic Godfrey Cheshire and historian Edward Leslie. Both are off the rack, while Cheshire's veers into a bit of fawning. There is an interview with actor Jeffrey Wright. It runs about half an hour, and reveals little of depth, save that Wright feels that his work and character were somehow important, as is the film. There are two audio commentaries, one by Lee and Schamus, and the other with cinematographer Elmes, sound designer Drew Kunin, and production designer Mark Friedberg. The latter one, is, by far, the superior one; and an excellent one, in its own right. It deals with the making of the film, the historicity of the film, and other aspects of the film and its place in the history of Civil War cinema. Overall, the most enjoyable of my three viewings of the film came with this commentary.But, since the artistic level of the film is so lacking, it opens up the film for scrutiny on its historical accuracy, and here, and despite Lee's protestations to the contrary, the film also fails, often abysmally. First and foremost is the treatment of the Daniel Holt character. While it is true that there were some black bushwhackers and blacks who fought for the Confederacy, the fact that Holt is treated fairly well by his three main comrades, allowed to serve side-by-side with white men, and later allowed to sleep inside the home of a white family, rather than the barn, as well as eat from their dishes, is simply implausible. If one, or possibly two, of these things occurred, perhaps there is some plausibility, but the whole string, plus several other minor PC touches? No way. If the white folks had been John Brown devotees, then this would be likely, but never in the home of Confederate loyalists, whose friends, family, and neighbors had died in support of keeping blacks in chains. The only explanation for this is Lee's almost terminal Political Correctness, evident throughout his film work, and which came to a nasty boil in Brokeback Mountain. In fact, in his commentary, Lee almost brags about his historical revisionism, by trying to recast the Civil War as the first wave of what is now modern globalization. Yet, despite the revisionism and PC, the film also bends over backward to sympathetically portray the Confederates- it makes racism almost non-existent amongst the majority of whites, as well as making that which does physically non-threatening, it treats its characters as if they were contemporary- especially in terms of sexuality, and it utterly decontextualizes Jayhawker attacks into mere terrorism while glorifying the true terrorism of the Lawrence Massacre. These flaws are why the most important scene in the whole film comes an hour and 43 minutes in, because it does not give in to the rest of the film's revisionism and PC, and also artistically flows naturally out of actions just seen, rather than the filmmaker's desire to just shoehorn it in to make a point. The moment is when a drunken Confederate Raider is lying passed out on a barrel, and a Lawrence boy, who has just witnessed the Rebel carnage, takes the drunk man's gun, and shoots him dead as he awakens. This moment is important because it is the only moment in the film, artistically, where the viewer sees the `good guys' win, and where the viewer goes, `Yeah, got'im.' And it is important historically and psychologically, because it shows how the chain of violence in war breeds only more violence in the next generation.Unfortunately, that moment is rare in this rather mediocre film, which meanders inoffensively, somewhere between great and terrible. Watching it, I kept wondering what this raw material would have ended up being in the hands of a true master, like Michelangelo Antonioni, Stanley Kubrick, or even Martin Scorsese in his prime (he never did a Western). But, I suppose that this was the best a studio director like Lee could do. I do wonder, though, why this film was chosen to be given the Criterion treatment? It is not historically nor artistically important, and it does not even have the `cheese' factor that some other Criterion titles (&lt;cough, cough> Armageddon) do. Given the number of important and great foreign films that are neglected and unavailable in America, in good quality DVD packages (Kenji Mizoguchi's Life Of Oharu, anyone?), and given the sparse resources Criterion and other DVD companies have been devoting to new releases, one has to wonder why such an average little film as this was elevated, when it can only come at the expense of far greater films whose future audiences are left hanging. Regardless, Ride With The Devil is not a classic, nor a great, film, but Meyers' performance is one of the better performances in the Western and/or Civil War genre. It's not much, but as the Bushwhackers learnt, sometimes you just have to take what little life offers.",2,Solid,1283299200,"09 1, 2010",2010,7445,"['Technically', 'film', 'moments', 'real', 'power',

Perhaps this new version will acquire its share of admirers where the previous one did not. Love or hate the film, this is the version that Lee intended to make.There is an audio commentary by director Ang Lee and producer/screenwriter James Schamus. They start things off by talking about the source material and the origins of the film's title. Schamus explains that at the time they made Ride with the Devil, the studio was in turmoil and the film was given a brief theatrical release, never finding its audience. They point out the footage that was put back in and the reasons why. Both Lee and Schamus praise the young cast and talk briefly about what some of them brought to their respective roles. This is an engaging and informative track.Also included is a commentary by cinematographer Frederick Elmes, sound designer Drew Kunin and production designer Mark Friedberg. Surprisingly, these guys put what we are watching in some kind of historical context. In fact, they talk at length about the historical aspects.

71052,A3CX9ZSEFCDXX4,0783241909,Daniel Hurley,"[18, 20]","Fast paced, authentic look and feel of Civil War in Missouri, which is more a war against civilians as the union army comes to southern Missouri with civilians caught in the cross fire of a war without rules or restraint. Suspected southern and union sympathizing neighbors become suspicious of each other suffering the brutality of war setting the tone for a virtual ""no quarter war"". Without a standing army or at least without a true military organization, the confederates fight a guerilla war and look like the bushwhackers they call themselves. The dandified and the regular farmers all fight together. Toby McGuire, referred to as ""Duchy"" due to his German family roots, fights for the south along with his best friend Jack Bull, played well by Skeet Ulrich ('As Good as it gets') after Bull's father is murdered by Union regulators. They ride with a guerilla troop led by Black John that eventually culminates in a grand epic like revenge attack on Lawrence, Kansas with Quantrill. There is no mercy again for soldiers or civilians. The scene and the conflict reminds one of the village scene in 'Platoon"" where blatant brutality comes in conflict with McQuire who takes action and in turn is suspected as a union sympathizer by the worst of the guerillas. The film's realism in clothing, weapons, horses, language and speech of the day is fitting throughout with an air for realism that is not at all strained. The realism of the picture is particularly vivid when the Union cavalry in pursuit is shown not marching in twos but in mass across the fields unlike the movies where they would be more strung out and vulnerable. In their semi-military defense, the southerners exhibit a lack of weaponry as they fire mostly revolvers and carbines are not exhibited. Maguire is first rate with subdued fury against his enemy while in conflict with the raw brutality exhibited by many of his peers. Although well suited for his friends Bull, George and a semi-free slave named Holt, Maguire faces another enemy within his own ranks, a cold hearted killer named Pitt Mackeson. Mackeson is an eerie and killing loving individual who holds a serious grudge against Maguire that erupts in the most inappropriate time. The Mackeson character is played very well by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in total contrast to his character as a likable coach in ""Bend it Like Beckam"". In the midst of the war scenes is the singer Jewell who plays a beautiful down home and unlucky at love mixed with war girl who falls for McGuire's friend and through the accidents of war becomes McGuire's dependent. In the midst of the slower parts of the film reflecting the intervals of war lays a relationship built upon naivety of McQuire and trust between him and Jewell. It actually works and the film captures the relationship within the period of those times with a humorous outcome involving a shotgun of sorts complete with an unusual wedding night. The movie is adept about social issues and conflicts among people that may believe differently but are killed sometimes due to pure circumstance. One very hard scene is the rounding up and killing of free blacks while the slave Holt is riding with his master George at the Lawrence raid. Holt's loyalty is to his master George in obvious conflict with what is right and he feels it. The movie is action packed with excellent dialogue and the action never stops until the very appropriate end. A little appreciated movie that ranks as a top western/civil war film.And the dialogue is certainly memorable:Jack Bull: Are you saying, sir, that we fight for nothing?Evans: Far from it, Mr. Chiles. You fight for everything that we ever had... as did my son. It's just that... we don't have it anymore",5,Authentic Civil War Picture of War In MIssouri & War Against Civilians,1130544000,"10 29, 2005",2005,3719,"['Fast', 'paced', 'authentic', 'look', 'feel', 'Civil', 'War', 'Missouri', 'more', 'war', 'civilians', 'union', 'army', 'southern', 'Missouri', 'civilians', 'caught', 'cross', 'fire', 'war', 'rules', 'restraint', 'Suspected', 'southern', 'union', 'sympathizing', 'neighbors', 'become', 'suspicious', 'other', 'suffering', 'brutality', 'war', 'setting', 'tone', 'virtual', 'quarter', 'war', 'standing', 'army', 'least', 'true', 'military', 'organization', 'confederates', 'fight', 'guerilla', 'war', 'look', 'bushwhackers', 'call', 'dandified', 'regular', 'farmers', 'fight', 'together', 'Toby', 'McGuire', 'referred', 'Duchy', 'due', 'German', 'family', 'roots', 'fights', 'south', 'best', 'friend', 'Jack', 'Bull', 'played', 'well', 'Skeet', 'Ulrich', 'Good', 'Bull', 'father', 'murdered', 'Union', 'regulators', 'ride', 'guerilla', 'troop', 'led', 'Black', 'John', 'eventually', 'grand', 'epic', 'revenge', 'attack', 'Lawrence', 'Kansas', 'Quantrill', 'mercy', 'again', 'soldiers', 'civilians', 'scene', 'conflict', 'one', 'village', 'scene', ""'Platoon"", 'where', 'blatant', 'brutality', 'conflict', 'McQuire', 'who', 'action', 'turn', 'suspected', 'union', 'sympathizer', 'worst', 'guerillas', 'film', 'realism', 'clothing', 'weapons', 'horses', 'language', 'speech', 'day', 'fitting', 'air', 'realism', 'not', 'strained', 'realism', 'picture', 'particularly', 'vivid', 'when', 'Union', 'cavalry', 'pursuit', 'shown', 'not', 'marching', 'twos', 'mass', 'fields', 'movies', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'strung', 'vulnerable', 'semi-military', 'defense', 'southerners', 'exhibit', 'lack', 'weaponry', 'fire', 'mostly', 'revolvers', 'carbines', 'are', 'not', 'exhibited', 'Maguire', 'first', 'rate', 'subdued', 'fury', 'enemy', 'conflict', 'raw', 'brutality', 'exhibited', 'many', 'peers', 'well', 'suited', 'friends', 'Bull', 'George', 'semi-free', 'slave', 'named', 'Holt', 'Maguire', 'enemy', 'own', 'ranks', 'cold', 'hearted', 'killer', 'named', 'Pitt', 'Mackeson', 'Mackeson', 'eerie', 'killing', 'loving', 'individual', 'who', 'serious', 'grudge', 'Maguire', 'most', 'inappropriate', 'time', 'Mackeson', 'character', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'total', 'contrast', 'character', 'likable', 'coach', 'Bend', 'Beckam', 'midst', 'war', 'scenes', 'singer', 'Jewell', 'who', 'beautiful', 'down', 'home', 'unlucky', 'love', 'mixed', 'war', 'girl', 'who', 'McGuire', 'friend', 'accidents', 'war', 'becomes', 'McGuire', 'dependent', 'midst', 'slower', 'parts', 'film', 'reflecting', 'intervals', 'war', 'relationship', 'built', 'naivety', 'McQuire', 'trust', 'Jewell', 'actually', 'film', 'relationship', 'period', 'times', 'humorous', 'outcome', 'involving', 'shotgun', 'sorts', 'complete', 'unusual', 'wedding', 'night', 'movie', 'adept', 'social', 'issues', 'conflicts', 'people', 'may', 'believe', 'differently', 'are', 'killed', 'sometimes', 'due', 'pure', 'circumstance', 'One', 'very', 'hard', 'scene', 'rounding', 'up', 'killing', 'free', 'blacks', 'slave', 'Holt', 'riding', 'master', 'George', 'Lawrence', 'raid', 'Holt', 'loyalty', 'master', 'George', 'obvious', 'conflict', 'what', 'right', 'movie', 'action', 'packed', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'action', 'never', 'very', 'appropriate', 'end', 'little', 'appreciated', 'movie', 'top', 'western/civil', 'war', 'film.And', 'dialogue', 'certainly', 'memorable', 'Jack', 'Bull', 'Are', 'saying', 'sir', 'fight', 'nothing', 'Evans', 'Far', 'Mr.', 'Chiles', 'fight', 'everything', 'ever', 'had', 'did', 'son', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anymore']",N/A

She pointed out that Ang Lee had directed the film, which immediately appealed to me because I have found his other films--&quot;The Ice Storm and the &quot;Remains of the Day&quot;--especially moving and beautifully crafted.Nevertheless, I avoided the film when it played in the local theaters because Ms. Kemply also indicated it was rather bloody, and it is bloody--the Civil War was not a pretty sight. But, it probably is not nearly as bloody as &quot;Braveheart&quot;(which I have yet to watch) or &quot;The Search for Private Ryan&quot; (which left me stunned because I saw it on the big screen--but I am glad I saw it). &quot;Ride With the Devil&quot; probably has about the same amount of violence as &quot;The English Patient&quot; along with a shocking scene or two as well. I finally bought the DVD and I am glad I did.Lee takes time to develop his four main characters: Jake Roedel (Tobey McGuire); Jack Bull (Skeet Ulrich); Sue Lee Kelly (Jewel); and Holt (Jeffrey Wright). Jake and Jack are best friends sucked into the mindlessness of the war machine(reminded me of the anecdote Shelby Foote provides in Ken Burns film &quot;The Civil War&quot; about the response of a Southerner to a Yankee soldier who asked the Rebel why he was fighting, &quot;You don't own slaves, why are you here&quot;, to which the Southerner replied, &quot;Because you're here.&quot;)Holt is a Black man caught up in the fighting--on the Southern side, a curious fact explained by his life long friendship with another man (Blonde and White) who is fighting a war of retaliaton for wrongs committed against his family by the Yankees. All these men are &quot;bushwackers&quot; as they were called by the regular Union Army.  Quantrell is the most famous of these &quot;rebel outlaws&quot; and in one scene he rides through camp with his men.  Jake, Jack, and Holt join Quantrell to ride into &quot;Kansas, bloody Kansas.&quot;  Ang makes it very clear this raid resulted in one of the worst days in Kansas, and probably the dumbest raid ever staged.The story of the lives of Jake, Jack, Holt, and Sue Lee is beautifully told.  Lee's cinematography is gorgeous. In one scene, Jake steps out onto a porch on a frosty winter night and gazes up at the moon.  The camera holds Jake's view of the moon in it's lens a full minute. It is a heart-rending scene--a young boy in his teens probably wondering if he will ever find peace and beauty again. But, that's Lee's specialty--heart wrenching beauty the midst of suffering.",5,Excellent on all counts....,969494400,"09 21, 2000",2000,2688,"['became', 'intrigued', 'film', 'heard', 'favorable', 'review', 'critic', 'respect', 'National', 'Public', 'Radio', 'Rita', 'Kempley', 'who', 'also', 'reviews', 'Washington', 'Post', 'pointed', 'out', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'had', 'directed', 'film', 'immediately', 'appealed', 'have', 'found', 'other', 'films', 'quot', 'Ice', 'Storm', 'quot', 'Remains', 'Day', 'quot', 'especially', 'moving', 'beautifully', 'crafted.Nevertheless', 'avoided', 'film', 'when', 'played', 'local', 'theaters', 'Ms.', 'Kemply', 'also', 'indicated', 'was', 'rather', 'bloody', 'bloody', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'not', 'pretty', 'sight', 'probably', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'bloody', 'quot', 'Braveheart', 'quot', 'have', 'yet', 'watch', 'quot', 'Search', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'quot', 'left', 'stunned', 'saw', 'big', 'screen', 'am', 'glad', 'saw', 'quot', 'Ride', 'Devil', 'quot', 'probably', 'same', 'amount', 'violence', 'quot', 'English', 'Patient', 'quot', 'shocking', 'scene', 'two', 'well', 'finally', 'bought', 'DVD', 'am', 'glad', 'did.Lee', 'time', 'develop', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'Jake', 'Roedel', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'Jack', 'Bull', 'Skeet', 'Ulrich', 'Sue', 'Lee', 'Kelly', 'Jewel', 'Holt', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'Jake', 'Jack', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'sucked', 'mindlessness', 'war', 'machine', 'reminded', 'anecdote', 'Shelby', 'Foote', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'film', 'quot', 'Civil', 'War', 'quot', 'response', 'Southerner', 'Yankee', 'soldier', 'who', 'asked', 'Rebel', 'why', 'was', 'fighting', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'slaves', 'why', 'are', 'here', 'quot', 'Southerner', 'replied', 'quot', ""'re"", 'here.', 'quot', 'Holt', 'Black', 'man', 'caught', 'up', 'fighting', 'Southern', 'side', 'curious', 'fact', 'explained', 'life', 'long', 'friendship', 'man', 'Blonde', 'White', 'who', 'fighting', 'war', 'retaliaton', 'wrongs', 'committed', 'family', 'Yankees', 'men', 'are', 'quot', 'bushwackers', 'quot', 'were', 'called', 'regular', 'Union', 'Army', 'Quantrell', 'most', 'famous', 'quot', 'outlaws', 'quot', 'one', 'scene', 'camp', 'men', 'Jake', 'Jack', 'Holt', 'join', 'Quantrell', 'ride', 'quot', 'Kansas', 'bloody', 'Kansas.', 'quot', 'Ang', 'very', 'clear', 'raid', 'resulted', 'one', 'worst', 'days', 'Kansas', 'probably', 'dumbest', 'raid', 'ever', 'staged.The', 'story', 'lives', 'Jake', 'Jack', 'Holt', 'Sue', 'Lee', 'beautifully', 'told', 'Lee', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'one', 'scene', 'Jake', 'out', 'porch', 'frosty', 'winter', 'night', 'up', 'moon', 'camera', 'Jake', 'view', 'moon', 'full', 'minute', 'heart-rending', 'scene', 'young', 'boy', 'teens', 'probably', 'wondering', 'will', 'ever', 'find', 'peace', 'beauty', 'again', 'Lee', 'specialty', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'beauty', 'midst', 'suffering']",N/A
71057,A1RQQCPDN7ZCHU,0783241909,"E.A. Week ""reviewer-at-large""","[11, 14]","Despite the presence of Ang Lee at the helm, Ride with the Devil (1999) is something of an orphan.  USA, the studio that produced the film, was going under at the time of its release, and so it had limited theatrical exposure; Universal subsequently picked up the DVD rights.  While it's doubtful this movie would have been a box office smash, even with wider exposure, it's still worth viewing for its simply terrific cast.  Many of the actors' profiles have risen significantly since 1999; in fact, probably the most recognizable ""household name"" in the cast back then was pop singer Jewel, trying her hand at acting.Devil is set during the US Civil War--not among big, well-known battles, but in small, guerilla-like skirmishes waged between bands of Bushwackers (Confederate sympathizers) and Jayhawkers (Union loyalists) in the border states of Missouri and Kansas.  But Devil is less concerned with the war itself than with the effects of war on the lives of ordinary people, in particular, the terrible toll it takes on the humanity of the men fighting it.The story centers around a band of Bushwackers: affluent Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) joins the fighting after his father is killed by Jayhawkers; out of loyalty to Chiles, his best friend Jake Rodel (Tobey Maguire) joins up also.  Rodel struggles to maintain a semblance of compassion amidst the carnage, which puts him at odds with some of the other men, in particular the ruthless, bloodthirsty Pitt Mackeson (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers); because Rodel's father is a German immigrant and a Union supporter, many of the Bushwackers distrust him.  Their company is led by 'Black' John Ambrose (James Caviezel) and the aristocratic George Clyde (Simon Baker).  Clyde brings with him Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright), a slave he freed; because Clyde bought his freedom, Holt remains loyal to his former master and fights for the Confederate cause.  Not surprisingly, he's derided and belittled, distrusted even more than Rodel.Chiles, Rodel, Clyde, and Holt are thrown together in close confinement as they bunk down for the winter.  Chiles begins a romance with Sue Lee Shelley (Jewel), a young widow whose family is sheltering the men; Holt and Rodel become cautious friends, a bond formed partly because of their mutual status as outsiders.  Their refuge is shattered by a skirmish that ends disastrously, and once back among the other Bushwackers, Holt and Rodel visibly begin to doubt the wisdom of continuing a campaign whose purpose has become so muddled.  Their ethical conflict reaches a crisis point during a brutal Bushwacker raid on the pro-Union town of Lawrence, Kansas, after which they must decide for themselves where their honor lies.Devil is a handsome, thought-provoking film; unfortunately, it never quite seems to achieve emotional lift-off.  Lee's directing style may have something to do with this: the battle scenes are filmed extremely well, but with a weird detachment--they're cerebral, when they really need to be visceral.  The raid on the largely defenseless Kansas town is plainly horrific, and yet the sequence doesn't get under the viewer's skin the way it needs to; it's dispassionate rather than disturbing.  The only place where Lee achieves powerful immediacy is a scene involving a gruesome amputation; a lot of other scenes could have used this kind of urgency.To his credit, Lee wisely refrains from taking sides in the war: north and south are shown as equally capable of both mercy and barbarity.  Apart from a couple of musings about the power of education and the value of individual liberty, the film mostly avoids the trap of PC soapboxing.  Lee also refrains from waxing sentimental: the biggest emotional scenes are nicely underplayed-perhaps too underplayed; in his efforts to sidestep treacle, he instead verges on dry and academic.  Nevertheless, he does achieve some very effective moments--a running thread involving a pilfered bag of Union mail finds its mark perfectly, as does a slyly romantic interlude near the film's end.The strength of the movie lies in the uniformly excellent performances of its cast.  Ulrich, the nominal lead, is solid and engaging as Chiles, but because the character has few inner conflicts, he's not as interesting as Rodel, whose growth has a better defined arc.  Maguire is nothing short of wonderful, wholly believable as he takes Rodel from innocence to disillusionment to maturity and wisdom; he effectively conveys the contradictions of a young man, who for example, is a proficient killer but sexually almost completely ignorant.Similarly strong is Wright.  Far from a token minority, Holt is an integral part of the film--he starts out on the periphery of the cast and becomes more central as the plot unfolds.  By the time the movie ends, Holt has changed so subtly but so thoroughly that he's almost a different person.  Rhys-Meyers is also terrific; his Mackeson is despicable, but the actor gives him small touches of depth, especially in depicting Mackeson's spiral down into suicidal despair.Perhaps the biggest surprise in the cast is Jewel, warmly expressive and natural in her acting debut.  She's somewhat awkward in spots, but otherwise very solid, with a nice, easy screen presence--her work in the last thirty minutes or so is particularly good.  Granted, Sue Lee is hardly a demanding role, but Jewel makes her imminently likable; she doesn't overdo anything, and she exhibits nice chemistry with the other actors.  The rest of the cast is rounded out with a lot of small, excellent performances: Mark Ruffalo and Tom Wilkinson are particularly good; John Ales is very strong as William Quantrill, the man who provokes the raid on Lawrence.Devil's biggest fault is that, for a war movie, it lacks sweep and energy.  All the ingredients are here for a knockout film--good story, great cast, skilled director, beautiful cinematography--and yet the story unfolds at pretty much the same pitch from beginning to end, never quite achieving the highs it needs for lasting impact.  An utterly unmemorable score doesn't help: apart from some traditional folk music, it's as bland and generic as canned peas, and it does nothing to enhance the film's power.  Some viewers may find Devil too dry, but certainly it's worth catching to see so many gifted actors on the verge of greatness.  Tobey Maguire fans in particular should not miss it.",4,"The ""Lost"" Tobey Maguire Movie",1093910400,"08 31, 2004",2004,6392,"['presence', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'helm', 'Ride', 'Devil', '1999', 'something',

Being a history buff, I'm always interested in the various interpretations others place on our country's darkest hour (especially those not born in the States). The Border Wars between the Jayhawkers and Bushwhackers were not granted major coverage (during or post Civil War), but the ramifications were just as strong as the battles of Gettysburg, Shiloh, etc. because neighbor vs. neighbor, brother vs. brother, or father vs. son squared off.I was very impressed at the breadth of emotions the actors conveyed in director Lee's film. Tobey Maguire was a marvel to me (having not really appreciated any of his work, including the SPIDER-MAN trilogy). He's a boy having to do a man's work-a frightful thing in any world. Someone gave Skeet Ulrich (of SCREAM fame) a shot of acting serum, because his portrayal of Jack Bull Chiles was subtle, nuanced, and perfectly suited to the pacing of the film. Jewel's feature film debut was strong-nothing spectacular. The one caveat I have with her is that snaggletooth; it is a distraction when she speaks.An actor whose work I never question is Jeffrey Wright's. His Daniel Holt is tortured, burdened, but silently strong and empathetic. For another strong Wright performance view him as Dr. MLK, Jr. in the KING miniseries. Jonathan Brandis (from LADYBUGS) is unrecognizable as Cave Wyatt, and imbues the character with the proper sense of gravitas. James ""Jim"" Caviezel shines as Black John, and Mark Ruffalo's turn as Alf Bowden is brief but memorable.A showstopper (and scene-stealer) is Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Pitt Mackerson. Showcasing a fine ""Missoura"" drawl, he's a menace, a threat to humanity, a bloodthirsty savage hell-bent on death and destruction, yet, he's a charmer, and the viewer can't take their eyes off of him. It would have been a treat to see him featured more in this film. His determination on suicide by heading into Newport ""cause they got drinks there"" is powerful. I'd like to take an Amazonian poll to see who would NOT have shot that pretty head off though after he shot Tobey Maguire's Jake Roedel.A 4 star effort by Lee (the musical score-especially the banjo-could've been much stronger).

Relatives and neighbors took stands against each other and everyone was subject to the viciousness of the Bushwhackers, the Jayhawkers, or both.Although the storyline is presented from the point of view of fictional Bushwhacker Jake, the script manages to give a balanced picture of the atrocities inflicted by both sides, even William Quantrill's raid on Lawrence, Kansas (which was in retaliation for the deaths of women and girls who were being held by Union officials merely because they were related to Quantrill's men).The filmmakers take great pains with authenticity and it's refreshing to see that the Confederate States Army WAS in fact ethnically diverse, and that African-Americans did indeed serve in its ranks while still managing to show the harsh racism of the period.

Led by the grim Black John (Jim Caviezel), these  fellows and others fight for their families, revenge, and the thrill of it.  The movie gives a thoughtful and not often seen perspective of the Civil  War.

It was in the border states before and during the war that many outlaws were made -- the James brothers, Quantrill, Bloody Bill Anderson, and many others.  Very rarely are they shown within the context of that war.  Here is told the violence of the massacre of Lawrence, Kansas, and the brutality of Union forces in the state of Missouri.The story centers around four young men (Tobey Maguire as Jake Roedel;  Jack Bull Chiles played by Skeet Ulrich; George Clyde played by Simon Baker; and his former slave Holt played by Jeffrey Wright) who are forced to fight for their land and their lives against Union forces.  Along the way they meet a young widow, Sue Lee Shelley, played by Jewel.Joining up with William Clarke Quantrill, the young men learn the horrors of war and the price it often extracts.  The battle scenes are intense and well done.  It might be said that the story is shallow.  However, a better observation might be that, except for the action, the rest of the movie is downplayed, making the characters seem more human, more real than if they were played larger than life.  It is a simple story of ordinary people living their lives in the center of a chaos over which they have no control.People who enjoy this movie might also enjoy Gettysburg or The Red Badge of Courage (both book and movie).

Then the plot thickens when in this state the southerners are in fact irregulars, more half bandits, half guerrilla fighters.Nothing noble in them. They kill and that's all, even women if necessary and children for fun. In this band of assassins more than anything else a few characters are lost and wasted, including a free black man. The story has no real moral. It is nothing but a butchery and a systematic slaughtering of innocents.Racism is more than superficial and can concern anyone who is not Anglo-Saxon and protestant, and of course white. The first think they burn in a city is the school that the northerners had built first, even before the church.A widow gets intimate with one of these three or four men in hiding, and she gets pregnant, but the man dies of a wound and she is an unofficial widow again. She marries the friend of that dead man, but under pressure from the ""neighborhood"" and onto the friend who after all had done nothing.This film shows human attitudes in their extreme forms of immorality, including when they try to be ethical, they become immoral by imposing a moral rule on the people who have nothing to do with it. The end is a blind alley for most of these killers and the characters we had concentrated upon, in fact two men, and a woman, the widow with her new husband and the free black man can move on to the west.The scenery is nice but a good film is not a touristic brochure.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","I guess I'm going to have to chime into the minority opinion on Ang Lee's ""Ride With The Devil""--most people here seem to have found something special that was lacking for me. While it is a handsome production, it lacks heart, moral complexity, and genuine character development. The setup of this Civil War drama tells us that this was a war fought between neighbors and friends. As best friends, Skeet Ulrich and Tobey Maguire forego the regular army to be a part of the southern Bushwackers. Wreaking vengeance on abolitionist Jayhawkers, they murder with impunity anyone who stands on the other side of the issues.The Civil War is rich dramatic territory. I'd have loved to see regular men conflicted by the harsh choices that they must make. If this is neighbor against neighbor and friend against friend, there needs to be a little more ambiguity--a little more feeling about what they are being forced to do. But we never see that conflict or any real emotion, just actions. Without this context, ""Ride"" moves along with no real heart. Since we are not asked to understand our protagonists, much of their action seems soulless. And the conflict, itself, is never outlined with much detail--a rather perfunctory explanation of the situation did little to involve me in the story.One of the main issues with ""Ride with the Devil"" comes from the casting. The chief mistake is Tobey Maguire. Now I think that Maguire is talented--he has been quite effective in the ""Spiderman"" saga, ""Wonder Boys"" and ""The Ice Storm."" But here he plays a Civil War era soldier/marauder with a modern day slacker sensibility. It doesn't enhance the material and it doesn't suit the time frame. In lieu of actual emotion, he meets every scene head-on with a vacant grin. Whether he's hearing about his father's death, partaking in pillaging, or just romancing--not one emotion registers. We get a blank expression which leaves a complete void at the center of the picture. Jewel being cast as the female lead doesn't help matters, either. With line readings so flat--the scenes between the two of them are absolutely unendurable.There are a few nice performances, however. Jeffrey Wright is noteworthy, as always. In the film's most fleshed out role as a freed slave, he gives the one real heartfelt performance. Simon Baker also does well in a relatively minor role. He provides a much needed energy to any scene. The film is noticeably better when more actors are on screen. The action sequences will hold your interest, but in the quiet moments--the film all but stops dead in its tracks.In all honesty, this picture is only about 1 1/2 stars for me. I never thought a Civil War picture could be so lacking in drama, passion, and emotion. What should have been a powerful epic is just a plodding drama.

I particularly enjoy period pieces so I thought I'd give this a try and I'm pleased that I did. I so loved the *language* of the film, the slightly stilted, formal manner of speaking of the time: simple words, but often perceptive. As Jake, Tobey Maguire was especially good as the very young man coming of age in violent and uncertain times. He gives a subtle performance and Jake's evolution, as he slowly begins to question his loyalties and realizes the folly of the Bushwhackers, is not something that happens magically overnight or comes to a head in some big dramatically convenient moment. The scenes in which Jake reads the stolen letters meant for the Unionists are an elegant way of letting Jake into the hearts of *the enemy* without being preachy or heavy-handed. Maguire is also surrounded by a great cast of young talent and veteran character actors, all of whom are right on the mark, especially Jeffrey Wright. Jewel was a surprise, and a pleasant one. And while it's a drama, here and there are touches of sly humor in the film that work very well. Ag Lee crafted a fine film, and it's a shame that it didn't get much attention when it was released.True, it's not action packed and I can well understand that its slower pace may frustrate those who are looking for a more traditional action war or western film where the emphasis is on winning the big battle and the *right* side triumphing. It's very much a dialog film. But those with a little more patience might enjoy following the story of ordinary people affected by the Civil War.

71082,A38HVH5Z26WND,0783241909,"""lady_fushia""","[9, 10]","Ride With the Devil may not have found its audience in theaters, but it's a great movie, and it was meant to be seen on DVD format!The DVD version of this epic piece of filmmaking by Taiwan-born director Ang Lee focuses on a little-known aspect of the Civil War: the bloody and relentless border skirmishes along the Kansas and Missouri border that began in the 1850s and continued into the 1870s for almost a decade before and a decade after the five-year Civil War ended in 1865.The fighting in these border skirmishes was more like a continuous everyday version of the the modern conflicts in Ireland and the Middle East and even in some US streets ruled by urban gangs.The armies of the Blue and the Gray were not yet engaged on the battlefields of the south and the east when these young Missouri men took up their hunting rifles and turned them on the occupying Union army. The resulting warfare created such lingering hatreds that author Daniell Woodrell, (who wrote the book on which the movie is based), said martial law was declared in three counties years after the war.The movie's main characters are unusual choices to depict this  bloody, hatred-fueled ""battle to the knife, and knife to the hilt"" conflict: They are teenaged boys, southern-sympathizing ""Bushwhackers."" They took turns with pro-Union, Kansas-based ""Jayhawkers"" to stage retaliatory raids.Such a conflict was no place for middle ground, and yet that is just where lead character Tobey Maguire finds himself, as the son of a German immigrant. Such immigrants were distrusted because many of them favored an almost fascist-strong central government.Maguire's character, Jake ""Dutchy"" Roedel, is barely tolerated because he is the best friend (""near-brother"") of loyal good old boy and former rich old boy, Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich). The two grew up together, so when Jack Bull's father is killed by Jayhawkers, Jake ignores his own father and joins with Jack Bull.to battle them.Jake's father's words warning him that he would never be accepted among the Bushwhackers often comes to haunt him as he is singled out for suspicion, especially by a viscious fellow Bushwhacker, Pitt Mackeson, chillingly portrayed by Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers. His gorgeous smile appears in this movie only when Pitt Mackeson is shooting someone.In the movie's best performance, Jeffrey Wright portrays another outsider in the Bushwhacker camp: a freed slave who remains loyal to fight alongside the man who freed him. As the war goes on, this quiet fighter begins to realize that even loyalty has its limits in the face of overwhelming wrongdoing.In the DVD version of the story, you get to see more wide-shots of the Bushwhackers in camp and feel the boredom and lonliness that must have been part of camp life. In one scene, the men are transfixed by the reading of a Wisconsin mother's captured letter to her sons.The spectacular chase scenes, with their unusual perspectives and sense of urgency, are heart-thumping action.These scenes record to perfection and with great timing the skilled horseback riding and fancy gunplay in which Bushwhackers exchange weaponry on the run.Viewers may gain an appreciation for how the landscape of the early 1860s so vastly differed from anything we recognize today, and how it was possible for hundreds of armed soldiers on horses to travel 45 miles across enemy territory to execute one of the most brutal terrorist acts of the 19th century: The slaughter by Bushwhackers of 150 old men and young boys on an August morning in Lawrence, Kansas.The movie has its flaws.It is almost 3 hours long, and it lags toward the middle.Although Skeet Ulrich is billed as the movie's star, both he and first-time actress Jewel Kelcher turn in mannered performances.Still, if you enjoy Jewel's singing, you will love the video extra of her singing her song, ""Simple is True,"" based on a brief love affair.It's a bit syrupy, but the visuals are nice. Don't read the forced and unmetered lyrics, as they make little sense.The worst thing about this DVD is the total lack of any other bonus material of any note.No live interviews on the set. No comments or insights about filming from the director.Another cheat: The cast list does list all the major players, so if you click on a name, some written ""filmography"" material pops up. BUT that only happens for a few!Some production notes provide interesting insights into how the raid on Lawrence and other scenes were staged, and some of the filming difficulties, but again...no real interviews.Still, if you want to see some rousing story-telling about a pivotal time in American history, this DVD is well worth it.",4,DVD lends added grandeur to a great movie,1013472000,"02 12,

Bernabo,"[26, 28]","Missouri was one of the slave states that was kept in the Union during the Civil War and since it was on the far side of the Mississippi River it was not really part of the Western Theater of the war.  As the critical part of the Anaconda Plan the Union armies were seeking control of the Mississippi, which explained why General Grant was fighting his way from Tennessee to Vicksburg while Admiral Farragut took New Orleans.  In fact, there really was not an organized Confederate army in Missouri, which explains why the young Southern men in ""Ride with the Devil"" join the Irregulars, who waged guerrilla warfare against Union loyalists.  In this part of the war we do not talk about great battles, but rather the infamous raid that torched Lawrence, Kansas on August 21, 1863 as Quantrill's raiders murdered the pro-Union Jayhawks.The story here focus on six young men who join the bushwackers: Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire), a first generation American who wants to be considered as much a Southerner as any one else even though his father came from Germany (which means he is called ""Dutchy""); Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich), who hates the Yankees and has seen his family killed; George Clyde (Simon Baker-Denny), a gentleman fighting to preserve a way of life that is going to be gone with the wind; Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright), an ex-slave who fights besides Clyde because the man freed him; Pitt Mackeson (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), who is a sadist who glories in killing; and Black John (James Caviezel), almost as brutal but more driven by anger and revenge.The idea in ""Ride with the Devil"" is that when America went to war with itself in 1861 the young boys growing up in Missouri and Kansas were suddenly forced into a less than honorable manhood overnight.  Consequently, one of the first casualties of the war was their innocence.  In 1987 Missouri-born author Daniel Woodrell wrote his Civil War-era novel ""Woe to Live On.""  For Ang Lee the appeal was the drama of young people coming of age in the worst possible time in American history and the theme of self-emancipation.  The principal actors were put through three weeks of ""boot camp"" to capture the way the war dehumanized the young men forced to fight it.This film start out focusing on the friendship between Jake and Bull as much as it is on anything else, but then while hiding out from the Yankees during the winter Bull takes a liking to Sue Lee Shelly (Jewel), a young widow woman who is helping to provide them with food.  Having lost both his father and his best friend, Jake continues to fight because that is what he is supposed to be doing and starts to connect with two other characters in ways that will eventually change his life.  After the Lawrence Raid it is clear that the war is going to be lost and a young man who has not even seen twenty years realizes he is lost as well.Certainly ""Ride with the Devil"" is a beautiful film with the sense of period authenticity you would expect from Lee.  It is not really a movie about the Civil War any more than ""Cold Mountain"" is (an obvious comparison), but more about the friendships that take place during a war.  It is just not clear that this is the central theme because our expectations are raised by more standard plot considerations (love and revenge) that do not get played out the way you would think.  There is also a sense in which Roedel is the least interesting character of the bunch, yet he emerges as the central figure and the most important gun in the film is perhaps the one that is not fired.",4,Ang Lee's meditation on friendship during the Civil War,1087344000,"06 16, 2004",2004,3545,"['Missouri', 'was', 'one', 'slave', 'states', 'was', 'kept', 'Union', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'far', 'side', 'Mississippi', 'River', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'part', 'Western', 'Theater', 'war', 'critical', 'part', 'Anaconda', 'Plan', 'Union', 'armies', 'were', 'seeking', 'control', 'Mississippi', 'explained', 'why', 'General', 'Grant', 'was', 'fighting', 'way', 'Tennessee', 'Vicksburg', 'Admiral', 'Farragut', 'took', 'New', 'Orleans', 'fact', 'really', 'was', 'not', 'organized', 'Confederate', 'army', 'Missouri', 'why', 'young', 'Southern', 'men', 'Ride', 'Devil', 'join', 'Irregulars', 'who', 'waged', 'guerrilla', 'warfare', 'Union', 'loyalists', 'part', 'war', 'do', 'not', 'talk', 'great', 'battles', 'rather', 'infamous', 'raid', 'torched', 'Lawrence', 'Kansas', 'August', '21', '1863', 'Quantrill', 'raiders', 'murdered', 'pro-Union', 'Jayhawks.The', 'story', 'here', 'focus', 'six', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'join', 'bushwackers', 'Jake', 'Roedel', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'first', 'generation', 'American', 'who', 'be', 'considered', 'much', 'Southerner', 'one', 'else', 'even', 'father', 'came', 'Germany', 'called', 'Dutchy', 'Jack', 'Bull', 'Chiles', 'Skeet', 'Ulrich', 'who', 'Yankees', 'seen', 'family', 'killed', 'George', 'Clyde', 'Simon', 'Baker-Denny', 'gentleman', 'fighting', 'preserve', 'way', 'life', 'going', 'be', 'gone', 'wind', 'Daniel', 'Holt', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'ex-slave', 'who', 'Clyde', 'man', 'freed', 'Pitt', 'Mackeson', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'who', 'sadist', 'who', 'killing', 'Black', 'John', 'James', 'Caviezel', 'almost', 'brutal', 'more', 'driven', 'anger', 'revenge.The', 'idea', 'Ride', 'Devil', 'when', 'America', 'went', 'war', '1861', 'young', 'boys', 'growing', 'up', 'Missouri', 'Kansas', 'were', 'suddenly', 'forced', 'less', 'honorable', 'manhood', 'overnight', 'Consequently', 'one', 'first', 'casualties', 'war', 'was', 'innocence', '1987', 'Missouri-born', 'author', 'Daniel', 'Woodrell', 'wrote', 'Civil', 'War-era', 'novel', 'Woe', 'Live', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'appeal', 'was', 'drama', 'young', 'people', 'coming', 'age', 'worst', 'possible', 'time', 'American', 'history', 'theme', 'self-emancipation', 'principal', 'actors', 'were', 'put', 'three', 'weeks', 'boot', 'camp', 'capture', 'way', 'war', 'dehumanized', 'young', 'men', 'forced', 'fight', 'it.This', 'film', 'start', 'out', 'focusing', 'friendship', 'Jake', 'Bull', 'as', 'much', 'anything', 'else', 'then', 'hiding', 'out', 'Yankees', 'winter', 'Bull', 'liking', 'Sue', 'Lee', 'Shelly', 'Jewel', 'young', 'widow', 'woman', 'who', 'helping', 'provide', 'food', 'Having', 'lost', 'father', 'best', 'friend', 'Jake', 'fight', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'starts', 'connect', 'two', 'other', 'characters', 'ways', 'will', 'eventually', 'change', 'life', 'Lawrence', 'Raid', 'clear', 'war', 'going', 'be', 'lost', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'even', 'seen', 'twenty', 'years', 'lost', 'well.Certainly', 'Ride', 'Devil', 'beautiful', 'film', 'sense', 'period', 'authenticity', 'would', 'expect', 'Lee', 'not', 'really', 'movie', 'Civil', 'War', 'more', 'Cold', 'Mountain', 'obvious', 'comparison', 'more', 'friendships', 'take', 'place', 'war', 'just', 'not', 'clear', 'central', 'theme', 'expectations', 'are', 'raised', 'more', 'standard', 'plot', 'considerations', 'love', 'revenge', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'played', 'out', 'way', 'would', 'think', 'also', 'sense', 'Roedel', 'least', 'interesting', 'character', 'bunch', 'yet', 'central', 'figure', 'most', 'important', 'gun', 'film', 'perhaps', 'one', 'not', 'fired']",N/A

Because of the Missouri Compromise slavery has been allowed in the state, even though it is above the Mason-Dixon line (allowing slave-free Maine to enter the union at the same time.)There are many inhabitants sympathetic to both the Union and to the Confederacy and both the ""legitimate"" government and armies and independent groups of fanatical guerilla bush-whackers alternately commit atrocities against those who oppose them.Skeet Ulrich gets top billing as Jack Bull Chiles, who has been a Southern-sympathising friend of Tobey Maguire's Jake Roedel since childhood.  Jake is the son of German immigrants and because of this (and the fact that he can read) he is looked at as an outsider by some of the other Bushwhackers.  Simon Baker as George Clyde embodies his period role - he seems to be channeling George Custer and Buffalo Bill.  George is accompanied by Jeffrey Wright as Daniel Holt, a black man who is seemingly out of place amongst the Southern Bushwhackers.  The movie begins with him as a marginal character but by the end he is clearly one of the more important.  The explanation for why a free black man would follow a group of Southern Loyalists makes sense and we see Holt grow in our eyes and the eyes of the other characters more than anyone in the film.This group intermittently intermingles with Northern Troops and Southern Hotheads more whacko than themselves - especially Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as the brutal killer Pitt Mackeson.Jewel is cast as a love interest, and as an actress pulls off this part, but a more talented performer likely could have added a little depth to her role.

71088,A17LEYMZI8OYOQ,0783241909,"Michael B. Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[3, 3]","This is not your typical Civil War movie.  Unlike other films about this dark time in America's history, RIDE WITH THE DEVIL deals with the war on a strictly local level, rather than the overall conflict.Here we have neighbors and long-time friends fighting a guerrilla war, murdering each other with the utmost sociopathic cruelty.  There are no rules, no code of honor, thus even the innocent are slaughtered by the opposite side, just because they can be.  War, according to director Ang Lee and screenwriter James Schamus, who adapted a book by Daniel Woodrell, robs men of their souls.In one sequence, for example, Tobey Maguire, who seems to be about the only member of the Bushwhackers who has a conscience, arranges for his former neighbor (Mark Ruffalo), a Union prisoner facing execution, to be released so that he can carry a message back to his superiors. Ruffalo returns the favor by immediately returning home and murdering Maguire's non-combatant father.Perhaps the most interesting character in the film is Holt, the former slave played by JeffreyWright.  He is not fighting for any ""cause,"" but to be with his childhood friend (Simon Baker) who bought him from his master and gave him his freedom.  None of the other Missouri men are, in fact, really fighting for any reason other than hate and revenge.The battle scenes, particularly the raid on Lawrence, Kansas, are brutal and not for the squeamish.RIDE WITH THE DEVIL is an engrossing film with interesting characters, fine performances and some unexpected plot turns.  My only problem with it is its length.  For this Criterion release, director Lee reinserted approximately 14 minutes of footage that had been cut from the 1999 theatrical release.Lee, who has done an excellent job of recreating the Civil War era, is certainly a fine director, but those scenes were cut for a reason.

Moore,"[3, 3]","Ang Lee's ""Ride with the Devil"" deserved, but did not get, all the critical hyperbole and Oscar nominations that were showered on ""Cold Mountain"" a few years later. ""Cold Mountain"" is a fine, powerful film, but ""Ride with the Devil"" is clearly superior. The battle scenes in ""Ride with the Devil"" are as exciting as anyone could wish, but the true excitement of the film comes in its nuanced and complex characters, its portrayal of the effect of war on soldiers and civilians alike, and its delineation of the collision of love and reason against blind hatred and the thirst for revenge.Based on a novel by Daniel Woodrell, ""Ride with the Devil"" portrays a chapter of the Civil War little known to most Americans: the bloody battles in the border states of Missouri and Kansas between ""bushwhackers"" (Confederate guerrillas) and ""jayhawkers"" (Union loyalists). It follows Missouri farmboys Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) and Jack Bull (Skeet Ulrich) as they see Jack's family slaughtered by jayhawkers and, fired with rage and grief, join up with the bushwhackers. Their adventures, both hair-raising and mournful, lead to a surprisingly quiet, ironic end that is immeasurably more powerful than the shootout audiences have come to expect in films of this type.All the performances are extraordinary, particularly Jeffrey Wright as Holt, one of the most complex characters ever portrayed in an American film--a freed slave fighting alongside his best friend, who is also his former master. The singer Jewel is movingly natural as the girl Jake and Jack both love; I don't understand why she didn't have an acting career after this. As an especially crazed bushwhacker, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is at least as scary as he was in ""Match Point.""

As a civil war reenactor with 25+ years in, I find this movie one of my favorites. It does not romanticize the war. It brings to life the cold blooded murders of the Kansas-Missouri conflict that was a far cry from the historically gentrified ANV and AOP. It makes a distinction between the irregulars and the organized armies operating in the Eastern and Western theaters of that war. It spans a roughly three year period of brutality that is horrifying. The main characters are roughly sixteen at the opening of the movie and nineteen at it's close. The movie is, as I say, not pretty, but accurate. I know people from Kansas, whose family histories go back to that time. Their family bibles and diaries tell very similar stories. The movie also fits in nicely with the beginning half of The ""Outlaw Josie Wales"", adapted from ""Gone to Texas"". That movie, also portrays events along the border between those two states. On a historical note: Events became so out of hand that a 20 mile wide buffer zone had to be created on the border. See the movie! And now a word from our sponsors. The DVD has great quality.

Headlined by the  acting mix of Skeet Ulrich, Tobey  Maguire and pop singer  Jewel, the film takes a Confederate viewpoint in its  portrayal of the makeshift Bushwhackers - a band of guerrillas who waged  war against Union troops, just as their Northern Jayhawker  opposites did in the reverse. In the course of this 2-hour epic, these  ragtag  heroes don't accomplish very much - and they know  it. This is one of the  movie's key points.Jake (Maguire) has a German-emigre and  pro-Union  father who is killed by Yankees  well aware of his son's  sentiments. Jack  (Ulrich) is the son of a plantation  owner,  George (Simon Baker), a young edition of a  Southern gentleman, and - in the movie's most  interesting role, though belatedly so - Holt  (Jeffrey  Wright) is an ex-slave loyal to the  Bushwhackers' cause  because George purchased and freed him.It was interesting and refreshing  to see the North as a foreign occupation force and Jewel was a pleasant  surprise as well.

71098,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0783241909,Reviewer,"[20, 24]","The War Between the States was perhaps the darkest hour in the history of America; a war that pitted brother against brother and family against family and left scars that even today have not yet healed, and in all probability never will.  And, as in any story about any war, beyond any historical significance it is the personal discord behind the greater conflict that creates the emotional impetus that makes it involving.  It is the human element that renders the context necessary to give it perspective, which is what director Ang Lee provides in ""Ride With the Devil,"" a Civil War drama in which he focuses on the personal travails within the broader depiction of the War itself, and along the way manages to include an examination of one of the bloodiest chapters of the War, the infamous raid on Lawrence, Kansas, by Quantrill and his raiders, which he succeeds in presenting quite objectively from the Confederate point-of-view.In 1863, the Union influence predominates in the State of Kansas, and even across the border in neighboring Missouri, those with Confederate loyalties are finding it increasingly difficult to hold out against the encroaching Northerners, especially without the aid of what could be considered any ""regular"" Confederate troops.  And when things begin to really heat up around their own town, Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) and Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) form a band of their own and join in the fray, doing damage to the Union cause wherever it is practicable.  Jack Bull and Jake do not like the War and do not like killing; but they are standing up for what they believe to be right.There are others, however, even among their own, men like the young Pitt Mackeson (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), who will use the conflict as a vehicle for personal gain and as nothing more than an excuse to express their own violent nature through unnecessary brutality, perpetrated in many instances against innocent victims.  And so, for Jack Bull and Jake, as well as many just like them, it becomes a time in which loyalty and moral judgments will be sorely tested; a time during which their souls will be tempered in blood.  And they will have to ride with the very Devil himself, against seemingly insurmountable odds.As with all of his films, director Ang Lee approaches his story through an incisive, yet subtle examination of the traditions, cultural aspects and moral attitudes of the people and times he is depicting.  And in so doing, Lee provides his audience with at least some understanding of his subject that goes beyond the actual story and ultimately offers, perhaps, a deeper grasp of the motivations that propel his characters and the drama in which they are engaged.  Whether it's the traditions and customs that account for the relationship between a father and his daughters (""Eat Drink Man Woman""), the effects of class distinction (""Sense and Sensibility""), the honor and code by which a warrior lives and dies (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") or the moral ambiguities fostered by a lack of all of the above (""The Ice Storm""), Lee infuses his films with insights into the human condition that take them to a higher level.  This film is no exception; and (as he does with all his films), Lee presents his story with the aid of breathtaking cinematography (in this film, by Frederick Elmes, who also did ""The Ice Storm"" brilliantly), which under his guidance is nothing less than visual poetry.  It's that special Lee touch, and it adds a wistful, reflective sense to whatever story he is telling, which is one of the elements that make his films so memorable.As Jake, Tobey Maguire initially brings a sense of youthful innocence to the film that contrasts so effectively with the maturity he conveys later on as the story develops, and his character along with it.  Most importantly, Maguire convincingly and believably responds to the events that unfold around him, which adds to the credibility of the overall film and underscores the realism of the presentation:  His stoic acceptance of death and the news of those ""murdered"" in the various skirmishes and battles; the moral propriety to which those he encounters adhere, even in such troubled times; the betrayal, which because of the nature of the conflict is almost commonplace; and the loyalty and beliefs to which he and his companions cling adamantly.  It is all of this that Maguire achieves through his performance, and it is no small accomplishment.  It is, however, the kind of studied, understated performance that is often taken for granted, which is unfortunate; work like this is worthy of acclaim, and should be recognized.Skeet Ulrich is effective, as well, as Jack Bull, and Jewel (in her motion picture debut) turns in an engaging performance as Sue Lee Shelley.  It is Jeffrey Wright, however, who stands out in a notable supporting role as Daniel Holt, as well as Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who brings a chilling Christopher Walken-like menace to his role of Pitt.  Also, in what amounts to a cameo role (one scene), Mark Ruffalo leaves an indelible impression with very little screen time.The supporting cast includes James Caviezel (Black John), Simon Baker (George Clyde), Tom Guiry (Riley), Tom Wilkinson (Orton Brown), John Ales (Quantrill), John Judd (Otto Roedel) and Kathleen Warfel (Mrs. Chiles).  The Civil War will forever be an open wound upon the nation; but hopefully, as time goes on, it will be through the objective contemplations of filmmakers like Ang Lee and films like ""Ride With the Devil"" that will ultimately help to close the schism and promote healing.  In light of more recent events, it is something that is sorely needed, worldwide.  Film is a powerful medium; it can be educational as well as entertaining, and perhaps in the future more filmmakers, like Ang Lee, will embrace and promote a sense of unity through the sensitive depiction of the events and attitudes that make us what we are.",4,Solid Drama from Ang Lee,1024790400,"06 23, 2002",2002,5934,"['War', 'Between', 'States', 'was', 'perhaps', 'darkest', 'hour',

I like almost everything about it except the guerilla who so irrationally hates the lead character apparently for no better reason than xenophobia.  Our lead character is ""Dutch"" i.e. German, and this "" bad guy"" hates him for it.  It's overdone and not even well-acted.Otherwise the film is terrific drama and carefully researched history.  These are no hardbitten, tough Confederate Bushwhackers.  They're just a  bunch of boys with southern sympathies.  There's even a sense of fun in their depredations against the hated Yankees but it is, at times, desperately unfunny fun.  The Yankees burn out farmsteads, murder civilians and execute rebels.  The boys fight for revenge.They invade Kansas with Bill Quantrell.  In an effort of kill Jim Lane, leader of the rebel-murdering Red Legs, they attack the town of Lawrence which is his ""capital.""  Our boys kill almost every man in town.  This is the famous ""Rape of Lawrence"", a misnomer because not a single woman was touched...physically.  Boys who haven't achieved full size; boys whose revolvers almost drag the ground, happily participate in the massacre.The rebels--including a Yankee-killing black man fighting alongside his friend--retreat to Missouri.  There is a scene in which our boys have gone to winter quarters, a cave dug into the ground--that is especially memorable.  The white boys and the black fighter are there together when they are visited by a lovely young white woman who is providing them with food.  The girl is brilliant.  I can't catch it in writing.  She glaces at the black man, ""WHAT is He doing here?""  She's perfect.  Her words and actions are those of bygone attitudes and a bygone era.""He's my friend...,"" his white friend says,  ""...and he stays.""  Later we learn that the white and black boy have been friends since childhood and the white boy, as soon as he could raise the money, purchased his friend's freedom.  Later the white friend is killed in battle and, from the lips of his black friend, we learn something truly insightful--something about the power and grief that comes along with obligation and friendship.  ""Being that man's friend was harder than being his slave.""  Potent.  It's not a statement about slavery but about smothering obligation.Anyway, if you can look through its imperfections, this is a great movie.

71110,A19Y4W9RZDRNF4,0783241909,Theo Logos,"[154, 159]","Thus reasoned young bushwhacker Jake Roedel, (Tobey Maguire) summing up the condition of his native Missouri, torn apart by savage guerilla warfare, as neighbor fought and killed neighbor during the Civil War. This outstanding movie manages to take much the same attitude as it tells the tale of this troubling period that has usually been handled in a much more partisan manner.The Civil War in Missouri was particularly terrible, as the loyalties and interests of the population split between the Union and the Confederacy. Few regular troops were committed to Missouri, and most of the fighting was done by roving gangs of Irregulars; Secessionist Bushwhackers and Unionist Jayhawkers. These men more often made war on those who once had been their neighbors and friends than on uniformed troops, and terrible atrocities that were more murder than war were committed by each side.`Ride with the Devil' is an incredibly thoughtful and nuanced telling of this sad story. All of the protagonists are bushwhackers, but the movie does not attempt to paint them as pure heroes fighting against evil for all that is good and right. Instead, it manages to show them as young men who had the misfortune to be caught up in the sweep of history and forced into a violent life by unavoidable circumstances. We see the struggle some of them had between the violent actions that had become their life and their own sense of decency, and we see others enthusiastically revel in the murderous mayhem - glad for the excuse the war had given them to be free of the constraints of civilized society.  One scene in particular drives home the fact that these warriors were more boys than men. Jake (Maguire) faces his new bride, a young women already widowed by the war (Jewel) in the bedroom on their wedding night. When she asks him if he is a virgin, he blusters that ""I've seen plenty"" and when ask again if he has been with a woman, he seems frozen with terror, and only manages to say, ""Girl, I've killed fifteen men."" These were boys forced to become killers before many had the chance to be lovers.Though there were no Unionist protagonists in this film, it used an effective device to put across the humanity of the bushwhacker's enemies. A captured mailbag was plundered, and letters were read aloud as the bushwhacker's searched for enemy secrets. The letters turned out to be mundane messages from mothers to sons and brother to brother. The young men heard and acknowledge how like their own mothers and brothers these people sounded, and how in other circumstances they might find them fine people, before someone reminded them that the sons of that mother would kill them, given the chance.`Ride with the Devil' is filmed beautifully, and is as close to being cinematically perfect as could be desired. Its scenes of violence are quick, realistic, and brutal, but the film does not dwell on them. Indeed, there are long sequences that deal with nothing but the complex interpersonal relationships of the characters, and action war movie junkies are likely to find `Ride with the Devil' a disappointment despite its realism. Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as a shy, decent young man trying to maintain his integrity in a violent life, and Jeffery Wright is outstanding as a freed slave who fights for the bushwhackers out of loyalty to his friend who freed him. All of the roles are well cast and acted, including Jewel in her film debut as a young Confederate widow.`Ride with the Devil' is the best done of any Civil War film that I have yet seen. It is beautifully filmed, skillfully acted, intelligently written, and tells its story with fairness and perspective. Unfortunately, its virtues are exceeded by its obscurity, as so many have never heard of it. Now that you know of it, don't cheat yourself by missing this outstanding film.Theo Logos",5,"""It ain't right and it ain't wrong - it just is.""",1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,3847,"['Thus', 'reasoned', 'young', 'bushwhacker', 'Jake', 'Roedel', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'summing', 'up', 'condition', 'native', 'Missouri', 'torn', 'apart', 'savage', 'guerilla', 'warfare', 'neighbor', 'fought', 'killed', 'neighbor', 'Civil', 'War', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'take', 'much', 'same', 'attitude', 'tale', 'troubling', 'period', 'usually', 'been', 'handled', 'much', 'more', 'partisan', 'manner.The', 'Civil', 'War', 'Missouri', 'was', 'particularly', 'terrible', 'loyalties', 'interests', 'population', 'split', 'Union', 'Confederacy', 'Few', 'regular', 'troops', 'were', 'committed', 'Missouri', 'most', 'fighting', 'was', 'done', 'roving', 'gangs', 'Irregulars', 'Secessionist', 'Bushwhackers', 'Unionist', 'Jayhawkers', 'men', 'more', 'often', 'made', 'war', 'who', 'once', 'had', 'been', 'neighbors', 'friends', 'uniformed', 'troops', 'terrible', 'atrocities', 'were', 'more', 'murder', 'war', 'were', 'committed', 'side.', 'Ride', 'Devil', 'incredibly', 'thoughtful', 'nuanced', 'telling', 'sad', 'story', 'protagonists', 'are', 'bushwhackers', 'movie', 'not', 'attempt', 'paint', 'pure', 'heroes', 'fighting', 'evil', 'good', 'right', 'Instead', 'show', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'misfortune', 'be', 'caught', 'up', 'sweep', 'history', 'forced', 'violent', 'life', 'unavoidable', 'circumstances', 'see', 'struggle', 'had', 'violent', 'actions', 'had', 'become', 'life', 'own', 'sense', 'decency', 'see', 'others', 'enthusiastically', 'revel', 'murderous', 'mayhem', 'glad', 'excuse', 'war', 'had', 'given', 'be', 'free', 'constraints', 'civilized', 'society', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'drives', 'home', 'fact', 'warriors', 'were', 'more', 'boys', 'men', 'Jake', 'Maguire', 'new', 'bride', 'young', 'women', 'already', 'widowed', 'war', 'Jewel', 'bedroom', 'wedding', 'night', 'When', 'virgin', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'when', 'ask', 'again', 'been', 'woman', 'frozen', 'terror', 'only', 'say', 'Girl', ""'ve"", 'killed', 'fifteen', 'men', 'were', 'boys', 'forced', 'become', 'killers', 'many', 'had', 'chance', 'be', 'were', 'Unionist', 'protagonists', 'film', 'used', 'effective', 'device', 'put', 'humanity', 'bushwhacker', 'enemies', 'captured', 'mailbag', 'was', 'plundered', 'letters', 'were', 'read', 'aloud', 'bushwhacker', 'searched', 'enemy', 'secrets', 'letters', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'mundane', 'messages', 'mothers', 'sons', 'brother', 'brother', 'young', 'men', 'heard', 'acknowledge', 'how', 'own', 'mothers', 'brothers', 'people', 'sounded', 'how', 'other', 'circumstances', 'might', 'find', 'fine', 'people', 'someone', 'reminded', 'sons', 'mother', 'would', 'kill', 'given', 'chance.', 'Ride', 'Devil', 'filmed', 'beautifully', 'as', 'close', 'being', 'cinematically', 'perfect', 'could', 'be', 'desired', 'scenes', 'violence', 'are', 'quick', 'realistic', 'brutal', 'film', 'not', 'dwell', 'Indeed', 'are', 'long', 'sequences', 'deal', 'nothing', 'complex', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'characters', 'action', 'war', 'movie', 'junkies', 'are', 'likely', 'find', 'Ride', 'Devil', 'disappointment', 'realism', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'shy', 'decent', 'young', 'man', 'trying', 'maintain', 'integrity', 'violent', 'life', 'Jeffery', 'Wright', 'outstanding', 'freed', 'slave', 'who', 'bushwhackers', 'loyalty', 'friend', 'who', 'freed', 'roles', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'acted', 'including', 'Jewel', 'film', 'debut', 'young', 'Confederate', 'widow.', 'Ride', 'Devil', 'best', 'done', 'Civil', 'War', 'film', 'have', 'yet', 'seen', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'skillfully', 'acted', 'intelligently', 'written', 'story', 'fairness', 'perspective', 'Unfortunately', 'virtues', 'are', 'exceeded', 'obscurity', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'Now', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'cheat', 'missing', 'outstanding', 'film.Theo', 'Logos']",N/A

71116,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0783241909,Wuchak,"[11, 11]","Released in 1999 ""Ride with the Devil"" is a Civil War tale focusing on Southern guerrilla fighters known as Bushwhackers, mostly young men who stage daring raids on Union forces and communities along the Missouri/Kansas border. The story includes Quantrill's infamous 1963 raid on Lawrence, Kansas, which he burned & pillaged and murdered over 150 unarmed men, women and children.The story shines the spotlight on the son of a German immigrant (Tobey Maguire aka Spider-man), a beautiful woman (Jewel) and an ex-slave (Jeffrey Wright), all of whom take up the Southern cause. I enjoyed how Tobey and Wright slowly develop a close friendship, as well as Wright's growing sense of freedom as the story progresses. Jewel makes an impressive acting debut and should do more films, she's a natural.One reviewer erroneously stated that the film ran 3 hours so I was surprised when the credits started rolling at the 2 hour and 13 minute mark. In fact, I was disappointed because I wanted the story to continue; this is a sign of a good film. The story takes its time and gradually pulls you in.Before viewing ""Ride with the Devil"" I caught the new Indiana Jones flick ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" The contrast couldn't be more different -- ""Crystal Skull"" is essentially a 2-hour Road Runner cartoon, whereas ""Ride"" is a totally realistic drama/Western. Although I enjoyed ""Crystal Skull"" for what it is, it can't be taken serious for even a second, not to mention they overdid it with the over-the-top action and fake cgi location enhancements & props (cliffs, waterfalls, jungles, monkeys, etc.). ""Ride with the Devil"" is the perfect antidote to such looney-toon drivel. It's totally realistic and takes its time so you get to know the characters and FEEL their experiences. For instance, what's it like spending the entire Winter in a dugout hut in the woods with three other guys and the only highlight is some cute blond stopping by to drop off food? What's it like when you have no other recourse but to saw a buddy's arm off? What's it like when a blood-thirsty ""comrade"" tries to kill you during battle? What do you do when you run into him two years later and you're not sure what his intentions are?The film was shot in Western Missouri and Eastern Kansas where the conflicts actually took place. Authentic locations are vital to this viewer. After all, how are we to accept the film's visualization of history if it wasn't shot where the actual events occurred?I encourage you to view the film with the subtitles on as the language is sometimes hard to understand due to accents and archaic phrasing; this will help you follow what's going on and who's who.FINAL ANALYSIS: ""Ride with the Devil"" is reminiscent in quality & style of films like ""Cold Mountain,"" ""Pharoah's Army"" and ""The Long Riders."" If you appreciate those films you'll enjoy ""Ride."" It's leagues better than the generally aloof and soporific ""Gettysburg."" It's a class 'A' picture which brings to life Quantrill's raid on Lawrence, Kansas, including what leads up to it and what follows -- how can you go wrong?The dvd includes Jewel's music video for the song ""What's Simple is True.""PERSONAL GRADE: A- or B+",4,Southern guerrillas along the Missouri/Kansas border,1226880000,"11 17, 2008",2008,3185,"['Released', '1999', 'Ride', 'Devil', 'Civil', 'War', 'tale', 'focusing', 'Southern', 'guerrilla', 'fighters', 'known', 'Bushwhackers', 'mostly', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'stage', 'daring', 'raids', 'Union', 'forces', 'communities', 'Missouri/Kansas', 'border', 'story', 'Quantrill', 'infamous', '1963', 'raid', 'Lawrence', 'Kansas', 'burned', 'pillaged', 'murdered', '150', 'unarmed', 'men', 'women', 'children.The', 'story', 'spotlight', 'son', 'German', 'immigrant', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Spider-man', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Jewel', 'ex-slave', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'whom', 'take', 'up', 'Southern', 'cause', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'Tobey', 'Wright', 'slowly', 'develop', 'close', 'friendship', 'as', 'well', 'Wright', 'growing', 'sense', 'freedom', 'story', 'Jewel', 'impressive', 'acting', 'debut', 'should', 'do', 'more', 'films', 'natural.One', 'reviewer', 'erroneously', 'stated', 'film', 'ran', '3', 'hours', 'so', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'credits', 'started', 'rolling', '2', 'hour', '13', 'minute', 'mark', 'fact', 'was', 'disappointed', 'wanted', 'story', 'continue', 'sign', 'good', 'film', 'story', 'time', 'gradually', 'pulls', 'in.Before', 'viewing', 'Ride', 'Devil', 'caught', 'new', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'flick', 'Kingdom', 'Crystal', 'Skull', 'contrast', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'different', 'Crystal', 'Skull', 'essentially', '2-hour', 'Road', 'Runner', 'cartoon', 'Ride', 'totally', 'realistic', 'drama/Western', 'enjoyed', 'Crystal', 'Skull', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'serious', 'even', 'second', 'not', 'mention', 'overdid', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'fake', 'cgi', 'location', 'enhancements', 'props', 'cliffs', 'waterfalls', 'jungles', 'monkeys', 'etc.', 'Ride', 'Devil', 'perfect', 'antidote', 'such', 'looney-toon', 'drivel', 'totally', 'realistic', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'FEEL', 'experiences', 'instance', 'what', 'spending', 'entire', 'Winter', 'dugout', 'hut', 'woods', 'three', 'other', 'guys', 'only', 'highlight', 'cute', 'blond', 'stopping', 'drop', 'off', 'food', 'What', 'when', 'have', 'other', 'recourse', 'saw', 'buddy', 'arm', 'What', 'when', 'blood-thirsty', 'comrade', 'tries', 'kill', 'battle', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'when', 'run', 'two', 'years', 'later', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'intentions', 'are', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Western', 'Missouri', 'Eastern', 'Kansas', 'where', 'conflicts', 'actually', 'took', 'place', 'Authentic', 'locations', 'are', 'vital', 'viewer', 'how', 'are', 'accept', 'film', 'visualization', 'history', 'was', ""n't"", 'shot', 'where', 'actual', 'events', 'occurred', 'encourage', 'view', 'film', 'subtitles', 'language', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'understand', 'due', 'accents', 'archaic', 'phrasing', 'will', 'help', 'follow', 'what', 'going', 'who', 'who.FINAL', 'ANALYSIS', 'Devil', 'reminiscent', 'quality', 'style', 'films', 'Cold', 'Mountain', 'Pharoah', 'Army', 'Long', 'Riders', 'appreciate', 'films', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'Ride', 'leagues', 'better', 'generally', 'aloof', 'soporific', 'Gettysburg', 'class', 'A', 'picture', 'life', 'Quantrill', 'raid', 'Lawrence', 'Kansas', 'including', 'what', 'up', 'what', 'how', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'dvd', 'Jewel', 'music', 'video', 'song', 'What', 'Simple', 'True', 'PERSONAL', 'GRADE', 'A-', 'B+']",N/A

The town where my relatives lived was called Slater, which was just about 100 miles east of Kansas City. I wasn't born in Slater because the few people living there couldn't justify building a hospital, so my birth certificate says Marshall, MO. My grandfather worked on the railroad as a conductor (that's the guy who punched the tickets) and he ended up living in Slater because the train had to stop there for water for the steam engines. Many relatives lived in Slater, most of them from Germany.I remember returning to the city in Illinois where I lived in late summer with a slight southern accent and memories of my relatives, who to me were giants.
