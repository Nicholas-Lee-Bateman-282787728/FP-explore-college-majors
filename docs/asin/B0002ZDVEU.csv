852948,ARHUBLVXF8PGF,B0002ZDVEU,Aaa,"[7, 9]","Matt Damon returns to the screen as Jason Bourne, an amnesiac CIA assassin who can still remember how to kick your ass even if you have a semi-automatic weapon and he doesn't, and who somehow hasn't forgotten how to drive five-foot-wide vehicles really fast down three-foot-wide alleys.This episode opens with very a cool chase scene through a resort town on the coast of India. Thirty-something Jason, accompanied by frightened Euro-trash girlfriend Maria (the sometimes hot-sometimes not Franka Potente) drives his jeep off a bridge to escape from a Russian mercenary killer, and survives by holding his breath underwater for about an hour. Maria's not so lucky, and fails to respond to Jason's selfless mouth-to-mouth attempts to save her life with his three or four remaining air molecules. For most guys that kind of loss would be a major setback, but amnesia does have its upside (""Maria who?""). Hitting the road again, Bourne follows a trail of death and duplicity to Naples, Berlin, and Moscow, just one of which, it appears to this American stay-at-home, might be worth visiting, while the other two would not, not even for an overnight quickie with Cameron Diaz. In Berlin (which in this movie's rendering would take a week's supply of zoloft just to get to merely depressing) Jason plays a neat game of cat-and-mouse with a half-dozen CIA and Justice biggies who are out to shut him up, for reasons that may cause you to want to bring out the Roget's and look up ""contrived"" or maybe ""insipid"". Joan Allen as a steamy over-forty blonde Section Head will not remind you in any way of Janet Reno, trust me, but she won't remind you of Albert Einstein either, if you know what I mean. Here's an example: with about three thousand of her agents looking for Bourne, he is able to evade them by checking into the biggest hotel in Germany under the alias ""Jason Dourne"". OK, I made that up, but it's not far off.When Bourne finally discovers (or rediscovers) the truth about his own role in a years-ago assassination attempt gone awry, he heads to Moscow to deliver the absolute ballsiest apology in movie history. Like the decent guy he is, Bourne doesn't even attempt to fall back on the Steve Martin ""I forgot"" defense, which of course would have been very believable under the circumstances. I'm not telling you any more about this, except to say that the Russian babe from whom he begs forgiveness makes Anna Kournikova look like Lyle Lovett.Just as in The Bourne Identity, Damon's mien is pretty mono-dynamic---he's more android than human---but it's pretty hard to be too judgmental about a guy who can't even come up with the answer to any of the standard password-protection questions (Mother's maiden name? Uh...). Nonetheless, it's fun to watch him outwit the morons, even if it makes you wonder more than you already do about the quality of our agencies.

It showed the character Marie in the trailers, but she was only in the movie for a few minutes.  There was no charming conversation or chemistry like in the first movie.  Pretty much a solo mission.  So I subtract one star for that.  Also, I felt the story was week.  Although there was plenty of action, it could not compensate for the lame story.  The ending seemed depressing and out of character.  So I subtract another star for that.  Then I also agree with the other reviews that complained about the camera shaking.  Once in a while is OK, but not through the majority of the movie.  I subtract a 3rd star for that.  It was definitely a one time watch and would not hold up under repeated viewings.

852950,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0002ZDVEU,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[7, 9]","I must first say that I have not read this book, I am purely basing this review off the film that I just witnessed. When I watched the Bourne Identity, I was taken aback. While I didn't think that it was the best film out there, I did see potential and some very exciting location scenes. It was as if we were witnessing an American James Bond being Bourne (sorry, no more puns...). This original film kept me on my seat and excited about the characters during the two hour run. Sadly, I cannot say the same for the sequel, The Bourne Supremacy. It seemed, and felt, as if this was a harder book to put into a film. Perhaps it was the direction, or even the screenplay, but there was way too much happening in the short 109 minutes that this film ran. From inconsistent flashbacks to a feeling that you had to memorize the first film to get this one, I felt the Bourne Supremacy was like a spilled bucket of nails ... bits and pieces were all over the place, and it hurt to pick them all up at once.Damon seemed to do well revisiting his character of Jason Bourne, a bit more stable than in the original, his combination of two facial expressions helped push me through the rest of this film. Brian Cox is Brian Cox, his characters seem to always be very similar in nature. He looks gruff, but does he always need to act gruff? Joan Allen felt as if she had something up her rumpus throughout the entire film. Her character had no emotion, no expression, and no excitement, which eventually was pushed off onto me. She ruined this film. I could not stand watching her on screen, I felt that she had no chemistry with the rest of the cast and that she was involved only to collect the much needed paycheck. Did anyone else feel as if you were watching another version of X-Men? Wolverine can't remember his past and the Brian Cox connection? I guess I let my mind wander too much through this film or maybe I just wanted to re-watch that film instead, but there was this eerie resemblance that hovered over my mind.So, we have sub-par actors trying to build some intensity and ultimately failing? What else could go wrong? Well, how about the shambled mess of plots known as the ""story""? What was going on here. I felt as if I was being pulled in about a thousand different directions. I am a huge fan of the multi-layered stories, but only if they have some logical connection between them. There was no connection in this story. While director Greengrass attempted in every way possible to keep us in step with Bourne, you couldn't help but get lost. Literally, I felt as if I needed a road map when I rented this film. What does this tell you? Instead of the choppy, unsteady-cam flashback sequences, Greengrass should have spent a bit more time on some back-story or development. The drunken flashback moments just didn't work for me. I felt as if I could have understood this film a bit better by getting intoxicated myself, instead of allowing the director to do it for me. I was lost. It really felt as if they were grabbing at anything possible to connect this espionage thriller together. There was bad glue and I couldn't understand why nobody saw this.Actors being average (or below average) coupled with a broken, choppy story is no way to bring us a sequel. I guess if you wanted to build a better reputation on the original you would release a film like this. I should check the latest reports on how The Bourne Identity is doing in rental and sales to see if this is true. When you go into a sequel, you expect to see similar faces, bigger effects, and/or a deeper story. What instead occurred with The Bourne Supremacy were similar yet under-producing faces, no better effects (the car chase doesn't count since you can see that in nearly every other action/espionage film), and a story that ranks among the worst Hollywood has to offer. I am not sure how closely it is to Ludlum's story, but I have a feeling he may not be as happy with this endeavor. It was a brutal mutilation of his characters.Overall, I was not impressed. My wife didn't even make it through the film because it gave us both headaches. Damon can do Bourne well, but the material that he was handed to this film should have been reconsidered. Perhaps a new director would have worked to give a new image to the Bourne name and style. Either way, something needed to be done and it wasn't. This was a poor excuse for a sequel and a dark chapter in this seemingly exciting character's life. Skip it. I promise it will make you a better person.Grade: ** out of *****",2,I remember good things all the time.,1102636800,"12 10, 2004",2004,4549,"['must', 'first', 'say', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'am', 'purely', 'basing', 'review', 'film', 'just', 'witnessed', 'When', 'watched', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'was', 'taken', 'aback', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'best', 'film', 'there', 'did', 'see', 'potential', 'very', 'exciting', 'location', 'scenes', 'was', 'were', 'witnessing', 'American', 'James', 'Bond', 'being', 'Bourne', 'sorry', 'more', 'puns', 'original', 'film', 'kept', 'seat', 'excited', 'characters', 'two', 'hour', 'run', 'Sadly', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'same', 'sequel', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'seemed', 'felt', 'was', 'harder', 'book', 'put', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'direction', 'even', 'screenplay', 'there', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'happening', 'short', '109', 'minutes', 'film', 'ran', 'inconsistent', 'flashbacks', 'feeling', 'had', 'memorize', 'first', 'film', 'get', 'one', 'felt', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'was', 'spilled', 'bucket', 'nails', 'bits', 'pieces', 'were', 'place', 'hurt', 'pick', 'up', 'once.Damon', 'seemed', 'do', 'well', 'revisiting', 'character', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'bit', 'more', 'stable', 'original', 'combination', 'two', 'facial', 'expressions', 'helped', 'push', 'rest', 'film', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'characters', 'seem', 'always', 'be', 'very', 'similar', 'nature', 'gruff', 'always', 'need', 'act', 'gruff', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'felt', 'had', 'something', 'up', 'rumpus', 'entire', 'film', 'character', 'had', 'emotion', 'expression', 'excitement', 'eventually', 'was', 'pushed', 'off', 'ruined', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'stand', 'watching', 'screen', 'felt', 'had', 'chemistry', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'involved', 'only', 'collect', 'much', 'needed', 'paycheck', 'Did', 'anyone', 'else', 'feel', 'were', 'watching', 'version', 'X-Men', 'Wolverine', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'past', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'connection', 'guess', 'let', 'mind', 'wander', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'maybe', 'just', 'wanted', 're-watch', 'film', 'instead', 'there', 'was', 'eerie', 'resemblance', 'hovered', 'mind.So', 'have', 'sub-par', 'actors', 'trying', 'build', 'intensity', 'ultimately', 'failing', 'What', 'else', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'Well', 'how', 'shambled', 'mess', 'plots', 'known', 'story', 'What', 'was', 'going', 'here', 'felt', 'was', 'being', 'pulled', 'thousand', 'different', 'directions', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'multi-layered', 'stories', 'only', 'have', 'logical', 'connection', 'was', 'connection', 'story', 'director', 'Greengrass', 'attempted', 'way', 'possible', 'keep', 'step', 'Bourne', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'lost', 'Literally', 'felt', 'needed', 'road', 'map', 'when', 'rented', 'film', 'What', 'tell', 'Instead', 'choppy', 'unsteady-cam', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'Greengrass', 'should', 'have', 'spent', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'back-story', 'development', 'drunken', 'flashback', 'moments', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'understood', 'film', 'bit', 'better', 'getting', 'intoxicated', 'instead', 'allowing', 'director', 'do', 'was', 'lost', 'really', 'felt', 'were', 'grabbing', 'anything', 'possible', 'connect', 'espionage', 'thriller', 'together', 'was', 'bad', 'glue', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'nobody', 'saw', 'this.Actors', 'being', 'average', 'average', 'coupled', 'broken', 'choppy', 'story', 'way', 'bring', 'sequel', 'guess', 'wanted', 'build', 'better', 'reputation', 'original', 'would', 'release', 'film', 'should', 'check', 'latest', 'reports', 'how', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'doing', 'rental', 'sales', 'see', 'true', 'When', 'go', 'sequel', 'expect', 'see', 'similar', 'bigger', 'effects', 'and/or', 'deeper', 'story', 'What', 'instead', 'occurred', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'were', 'similar', 'yet', 'under-producing', 'better', 'effects', 'car', 'chase', ""n't"", 'count', 'can', 'see', 'nearly', 'other', 'action/espionage', 'film', 'story', 'worst', 'Hollywood', 'offer', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'closely', 'Ludlum', 'story', 'have', 'feeling', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'happy', 'endeavor', 'was', 'brutal', 'mutilation', 'characters.Overall', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'film', 'gave', 'headaches', 'Damon', 'can', 'do', 'Bourne', 'well', 'material', 'was', 'handed', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'reconsidered', 'Perhaps', 'new', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'give', 'new', 'image', 'Bourne', 'name', 'style', 'way', 'something', 'needed', 'be', 'done', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'poor', 'excuse', 'sequel', 'dark', 'chapter', 'seemingly', 'exciting', 'character', 'life', 'Skip', 'promise', 'will', 'make', 'better', 'person.Grade', '**', '*****']",N/A
852951,A2ELP13J2HSGJQ,B0002ZDVEU,AJ Denny,"[4, 6]","It is two years since at the end of The Bourne Identity, we left the wholesome, good looking all-American boy turned former CIA assassin with amnesia Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) to live happily ever with his grunge hippie girlfriend Maria (Franka Potente of Run, Lola, Run fame) on a sunny Greek island.Maybe it was they wanted to escape the Olympics he could of won a swag of gold medals in, but Paul Greengrass's sequel The Bourne Supremacy opens with the couple living ""off the radar"" amongst the sunny beaches of Goa, India.  Framed for the murder of a CIA case officer in Berlin, Bourne must leave this paradise not just to find out more about his past, but come to terms with how this knowledge affects the man he has become.You don't need to of seen The Bourne Identity to understand what is going on. Like with Bourne getting his memory back, you're given just enough information not to feel lost, but need to know more. The story revolves around the CIA investigation of a Russian oil tycoon, his possible involvement in the murder of a moderate Russian politician and the theft of a lot of CIA money. It all sounds as plausible as if it came from last week's newspaper.Damon's Jason Bourne is an interesting, sympathetic character placed into the middle of an already riveting story. He is a super spy who has paid for his talents by having no life. It is implied he and the other super agents of the ""black on black"" Project Treadstone were given their skills through the use of drugs, brainwashing and hypnotherapy with the side effect of turning them into potential psychopaths. The guilt and pain he feels as who ever he was before bleeds back into his personality is more brutal then any of the fight or action scenes.But yes, there are many of those and they are a joy to watch. Bourne fights and car chases his way through Goa, before heading off to Naples, Munich, Berlin and then finally Moscow.  Greengrass knows how to do action scenes with a documentary style so like the story; they had at least some air of plausibility to them. Also, it is interesting to see these cities at the street level. Around the action people are going about their daily lives in a studied detail the camera doesn't just whiz by.As a spy film this is worth seeing. As a film exploring how a man will work through the guilt he feels over a life he barely remembers, it is really worth taking a look.",5,"A smart, engrossing thriller",1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,2396,"['two', 'years', 'end', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'left', 'wholesome', 'good', 'looking', 'all-American', 'boy', 'turned', 'former', 'CIA', 'assassin', 'amnesia', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'grunge', 'hippie', 'girlfriend', 'Maria', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'fame', 'sunny', 'Greek', 'island.Maybe', 'was', 'wanted', 'escape', 'Olympics', 'could', 'won', 'swag', 'gold', 'medals', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'sequel', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'couple', 'living', 'radar', 'sunny', 'beaches', 'Goa', 'India', 'Framed', 'murder', 'CIA', 'case', 'officer', 'Berlin', 'Bourne', 'must', 'leave', 'paradise', 'not', 'just', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'past', 'come', 'terms', 'how', 'knowledge', 'man', 'become.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'seen', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'Bourne', 'getting', 'memory', 'back', ""'re"", 'given', 'just', 'enough', 'information', 'not', 'feel', 'lost', 'need', 'know', 'more', 'story', 'CIA', 'investigation', 'Russian', 'oil', 'tycoon', 'possible', 'involvement', 'murder', 'moderate', 'Russian', 'politician', 'theft', 'lot', 'CIA', 'money', 'as', 'plausible', 'came', 'last', 'week', 'newspaper.Damon', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'interesting', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'placed', 'middle', 'already', 'riveting', 'story', 'super', 'spy', 'who', 'paid', 'talents', 'having', 'life', 'implied', 'other', 'super', 'agents', 'black', 'black', 'Project', 'Treadstone', 'were', 'given', 'skills', 'use', 'drugs', 'brainwashing', 'hypnotherapy', 'side', 'effect', 'turning', 'potential', 'psychopaths', 'guilt', 'pain', 'who', 'ever', 'was', 'bleeds', 'back', 'personality', 'more', 'brutal', 'then', 'fight', 'action', 'scenes.But', 'yes', 'are', 'many', 'are', 'joy', 'watch', 'Bourne', 'fights', 'car', 'chases', 'way', 'Goa', 'heading', 'off', 'Naples', 'Munich', 'Berlin', 'then', 'finally', 'Moscow', 'Greengrass', 'how', 'do', 'action', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'style', 'story', 'had', 'least', 'air', 'plausibility', 'Also', 'interesting', 'see', 'cities', 'street', 'level', 'action', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'daily', 'lives', 'studied', 'detail', 'camera', ""n't"", 'just', 'whiz', 'by.As', 'spy', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'film', 'exploring', 'how', 'man', 'will', 'work', 'guilt', 'life', 'barely', 'really', 'worth', 'taking', 'look']",N/A

852954,A3TLY1A7NGVCQM,B0002ZDVEU,"Alexander E. Paulsen ""AlexP""","[1, 2]","There has been a trend lately for sequels to be better than the original films. Lord of the Rings springs to mind, but Spiderman 2 and the Matrix series all seemed to improve as the story progressed.I was really looking forward to the Bounrne Supremacy. Based on the trailer at apple.com I was ready for a spectacular film.In many ways I was not disappointed, but the film fell short of the first. Mainly I think due to director Greengrass's style.Yes the action was fast and furious but somehow the story line got short-shrifted and a little lost in the cacaphony.I liked the way Doug Liman drew the story and the mystery while at the same time building the chemistry between Bourne and Marie.Greengrass opted for a more breakneck pace and way excessive use of the hand-held camera. I don't mind the and-held camera but tis movie was like watching ""The Shield"" on cocaine.Damon again excelled in the role of Jason Bourne and played it exactly thee way a die-ard fan of the Ludlum series would expect.The supporting case was likewise excellent and I enjoyed seeing Julia Stiles back as Nikki, Joan Allen was well cast as the the CIA agent hunting Bourne and Brian Cox practically stole every scene back as bad-guy Abbot. I was even happy to see snippets of Chris Cooper in flashbacks.Overall I loved the film but I think keeping Liman behind the camera would have given us a tighter story, more continuity and a little less motion sickness.",4,Worthy sequel,1093478400,"08 26, 2004",2004,1440,"['been', 'trend', 'lately', 'sequels', 'be', 'better', 'original', 'films', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'springs', 'mind', 'Spiderman', '2', 'Matrix', 'series', 'all', 'seemed', 'improve', 'story', 'progressed.I', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'Bounrne', 'Supremacy', 'Based', 'trailer', 'apple.com', 'was', 'ready', 'spectacular', 'film.In', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'film', 'fell', 'short', 'first', 'Mainly', 'think', 'due', 'director', 'Greengrass', 'style.Yes', 'action', 'was', 'fast', 'furious', 'somehow', 'story', 'line', 'got', 'short-shrifted', 'little', 'lost', 'cacaphony.I', 'liked', 'way', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'drew', 'story', 'mystery', 'same', 'time', 'building', 'chemistry', 'Bourne', 'Marie.Greengrass', 'opted', 'more', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'way', 'excessive', 'use', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'and-held', 'camera', 'tis', 'movie', 'was', 'watching', 'Shield', 'cocaine.Damon', 'again', 'excelled', 'role', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'played', 'exactly', 'way', 'die-ard', 'fan', 'Ludlum', 'series', 'would', 'expect.The', 'supporting', 'case', 'was', 'likewise', 'excellent', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'back', 'Nikki', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'was', 'well', 'cast', 'CIA', 'agent', 'hunting', 'Bourne', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'practically', 'stole', 'scene', 'back', 'bad-guy', 'Abbot', 'was', 'even', 'happy', 'see', 'snippets', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'flashbacks.Overall', 'loved', 'film', 'think', 'keeping', 'Liman', 'camera', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'tighter', 'story', 'more', 'continuity', 'little', 'less', 'motion', 'sickness']",N/A

While these stories are not faithful adaptations of Robert Ludlum's novels they do capture the essence of the novels - the idea of this former CIA mercenary who only wants to live a normal life, but can't seem to escape the clutches of a government that wants to kill him, or use him if they can.  What the creators of these films do is re-imagine the stories in modern times using modern-age enemies to face Bourne.  Matt Damon has really wrapped himself around the essence of the character and at times has some real moments of drama that you don't normally see in action movies of this type.  Damon is also surrounded by a great supporting cast.  Brian Cox and Julia Stiles are back and do a fantastic job.

In the absence of any flow of real Christian entertainment coming out of Hollywood, I think it's very important to point out that this is an extraordinarily Christian film.  Bourne is fighting evil; Bourne is seeking to discover those who have enmeshed him in what he knows to be evil; and his conscience guides him as he moves through this rapid paced, wonderfully scripted, wonderfully acted, and wonderfully directed film. His motives can never be reduced to mere revenge.  Others in the film also wrestle with serious moral issues.  But Bourne is the Knight. ----- His mission results in his extracting a moment of recognition from the villain of what the villain has done, and then Bourne proceeds to seek redemption himself in the only way he knows how.  He consciously rejects evil for good.  ---- Whether Christ is ever mentioned in the film doesn't matter. ----.  What matters is that this is a film reflecting deep moral values, and it is also a film you can watch with your children. There is no jarring sexuality, and the violence in the film is actually treated with conscientious respect.  It is treated with appropriate depth for the horror that it is.  ---- Until we start getting some really profound Christian entertainment from the TV and Movie execs who seem for the moment to scorn it, I think it's important to point out those films which reflect deep Christian values, and to repeat: this film is such a one.

A lot of the suspense of the first film really wasn't there.My friend leaned over to me during the film and said that he thinks the movie should be a TV series where Bourne discovers more about his identity as the series goes on. And I feel that this film would have made a good one hour episode of a TV show, or even a two part episode, or it could have been stretched over a series of episodes as a type of subplot (like Mulder's sister in X-Files).

He finds out.A neat twist is that the supervisor in charge of the project of ""resolving"" Jason Bourne is a woman, one of those super-bitches who walk all over everyone to prove she's at least as tough as any man. Yeah, right. However, it does make it all the easier to root for Bourne to show her up. He does, of course. The scene I liked most was when he called her to tell her his terms for coming in out of the cold. He said to send Nicki, the operative who had run things in Paris. She says, ""Suppose I can't find Nicki?"" ""You shouldn't have any trouble,"" he counters from his perch on the next building, ""She's standing right next to you."" The way the blond bitch suddenly turns to the window, genuine shock registering on her face, is terrific. Imagine a big-time CIA boss who stands in front of open windows!The pace is unrelenting. Seldom is there a scene that runs in human real-time, allowing the audience to know what the heck is going on. An amazing fight scene between Bourne and another of these highly specialized killers is extended to the point where frankly, it is pretty literally unbelievable. No one could survive and keep fighting the way these two do.So who do each of these people work for, and what are they up to? I suppose the point is that in CIA operations, you don't always know.

852967,ALR35EFI69S5R,B0002ZDVEU,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[30, 38]","Wow! Talk about a taut, mind-numbing set of sequences full of energy, moment and action, this sequel to the original -The Bourne Identity- is that most elusive of entities, a much better, tighter, and suspenseful movie than its original. This sharply spun tale allows Matt Damon to reprise his role as Jason Bourne, the recovering amnesiac CIA spy gone AWOL, this time running for his life through a catalogue of cities from Goa, India to Berlin, and from Berlin to Moscow. And with an action coda that brings to mind the breathless pace of such action classics as Steve McQueen?s -Bullitt-, it is so quick, deft, and terrific one can literally get lost in the activity.Damon is superb as Bourne, an angry, amnesiac, and absolutely murderous foe for anyone who crosses his path with deadly intent, which seems to happen with stunning regularity in this film. Given the current popular disgust and disdain for the CIA, the movie hits home by portraying its hierarchy as thugs in business suits, bent on silencing Bourne regardless of his innocence or guilt. Damon is losing some of his boy-next-door qualities, but burns up the screen with an Eastwood like set of facial expressions that underplay the emotions and make the dialogue often sparse and terse. His physical presence more than makes up for the verbal void, however. His moves are nothing short of spellbinding.Luckily, the plot avoids the current morbid Hollywood preoccupation with terrorists, middle Eastern personalities, or religious overtones, and rather chooses to concentrate on more traditional East European skullduggery with undertones of big money and dirty oil deals in setting the stage for murder, mayhem, and some of the most outrageously memorable car chase scenes this side of -The French Connection-. This is an exciting movie franchise that one can rest easy about, knowing it will certainly be fleshed out entertainingly over the years by Damon and company. With superbly and smartly produced thrillers like this, why not spin the yarn as far as it will go?

Then a CIA operation goes bad, agents are killed, and Bourne's fingerprint is left behind ... in Berlin. At the same time, his girlfriend is shot in a bullet meant for him, which brings him roaring back to the West to settle matters once and for all, unaware that he's been framed as a traitor who kills CIA agents.So far, so good. Throw in a ripped-from-today's-headlines Russian oil magnate and you'd think we'd be in good company, but neither Matt Damon nor Joan Allen (in a stellar performance) can save this. Things get confused to the point where one suspects the director wasn't really sure what was going on.

Unfortunately this film was a major let down.  The reasoning behind the failure of this movie to live up to the first movie in the series was not the acting or the storyline (which was good despite the fact that it was overly predictable), it was the poor decision of the director (Greengrass) to film much of it with handheld cameras to add a sense of anxiety.  The result is a movie that looks like it was filmed during an earthquake, and not just a tremor mind you, but a full blown catastrophic rictor scale rocking disaster.  The screen is constantly bouncing up and down and to and fro making it extremly difficult to follow the action and get caught up in the story.  With this movie I think I finaly found an action sequence style more irritating than slow motion scenes.  As a result, Greengrass has damaged an otherwise decent action film.  This causes me further concern because I have heard that he has been named as the director of the soon to be filmed follow-up, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"".  Hopefully he will have gotten the shakes out of his system and can film a more watchable movie next time around.That said, the movie is based loosely upon the best selling novel of the same name penned by Robert Ludlum in 1986.  It follows the continuing adventures of the title character, Jason Bourne (well played by Damon), a CIA trained super assassin who is struggling to overcome a major case of amnesia which was introduced at the begining of the first film when his bullet riddled body was pulled from the ocean by a fisherman.  In this movie Bourne, who now resides in Goa, India with his love interest from the first film (Potente) is troubled by a recurring flashback of a murder of a man and woman in a hotel room that he apparently committed some time before.  His troubles are compounded by the fact that the CIA believes him to be responsible for the murder of some agents in a recent Berlin operation.  The CIA begins looking for Bourne which embarks him upon a series of events in which his imbedded training comes in handy as he turns the tables on his pursuers.  As I said this could have been a good movie had it been filmed in a more watchable manner.  As it is, I found it difficult to stay with the story as it literaly bounced around the screen.  I would recommend it only to those who enjoy the series or who are fans of Damon-but I would advise anyone watching this film to take a heavy dose of Dramamine before pressing play.",2,The Bourne Supremacy  (2004),1106265600,"01 21, 2005",2005,2860,"['Title', 'Bourne', 'SupremacyReleased', '2004Rated', 'PG-13Running', 'Time', '1', 'hour', '49', 'minutesDirected', 'Paul', 'GreengrassStarring', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Jason', 'BourneFranka', 'Potente', 'MarieBrian', 'Cox', 'Ward', 'AbbottJulia', 'Stiles', 'NickyAfter', 'thorough', 'enjoyment', 'viewing', 'movie', 'predecessor', 'Bourne', 'Identity', '2002', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'sequel', 'especially', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'was', 'major', 'let', 'down', 'reasoning', 'failure', 'movie', 'live', 'up', 'first', 'movie', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'acting', 'storyline', 'was', 'good', 'fact', 'was', 'overly', 'predictable', 'was', 'poor', 'decision', 'director', 'Greengrass', 'film', 'much', 'handheld', 'cameras', 'add', 'sense', 'anxiety', 'result', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'earthquake', 'not', 'just', 'tremor', 'mind', 'full', 'blown', 'catastrophic', 'rictor', 'scale', 'rocking', 'disaster', 'screen', 'constantly', 'bouncing', 'up', 'down', 'fro', 'making', 'extremly', 'difficult', 'follow', 'action', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'movie', 'think', 'finaly', 'found', 'action', 'sequence', 'style', 'more', 'irritating', 'slow', 'motion', 'scenes', 'result', 'Greengrass', 'damaged', 'otherwise', 'decent', 'action', 'film', 'further', 'concern', 'have', 'heard', 'been', 'named', 'director', 'soon', 'be', 'filmed', 'follow-up', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'have', 'gotten', 'shakes', 'system', 'can', 'film', 'more', 'watchable', 'movie', 'next', 'time', 'said', 'movie', 'based', 'loosely', 'best', 'selling', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'penned', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', '1986', 'continuing', 'adventures', 'title', 'character', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'well', 'played', 'Damon', 'CIA', 'trained', 'super', 'assassin', 'who', 'struggling', 'overcome', 'major', 'case', 'amnesia', 'was', 'introduced', 'begining', 'first', 'film', 'when', 'bullet', 'riddled', 'body', 'was', 'pulled', 'ocean', 'fisherman', 'movie', 'Bourne', 'who', 'now', 'Goa', 'India', 'love', 'interest', 'first', 'film', 'Potente', 'troubled', 'recurring', 'flashback', 'murder', 'man', 'woman', 'hotel', 'room', 'apparently', 'committed', 'time', 'troubles', 'are', 'compounded', 'fact', 'CIA', 'be', 'responsible', 'murder', 'agents', 'recent', 'Berlin', 'operation', 'CIA', 'looking', 'Bourne', 'series', 'events', 'imbedded', 'training', 'handy', 'tables', 'pursuers', 'said', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'more', 'watchable', 'manner', 'found', 'difficult', 'stay', 'story', 'bounced', 'screen', 'would', 'recommend', 'only', 'who', 'enjoy', 'series', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'Damon-but', 'would', 'advise', 'anyone', 'watching', 'film', 'take', 'heavy', 'dose', 'Dramamine', 'pressing', 'play']",N/A

That's sort of a defense mechanism for an avid reader seeing a great book made into a film . If it disappoints, it's not a big deal. If the movie is good, it's a pleasant surprise and highly enjoyable. Not only was I pleased with ""THE BOURNE IDENTITY"", I was impressed!That brings us to THE BOURNE SUPREMACY. A lot of people, for whatever reason, who read the Bourne series considered 'Supremacy' a letdown, and wondered if the same would happen in the film series. It did not.

It takes the reigns and drives it right over the cliff that is mediocrity. This movie is so hard on your eyes that you find yourself thinking about how hard it is on your eyes and not the movie. Audience withdrawal is not a way to create tension or suspense. Also, the rapid fire cuts and unfocused camera work makes you realize how little you actually see. What is meant to appear as a colossal and destructive car chase boils down to lots of tiny flashes that could be in all reality, bumper cars in an alley.The plot had all the forward motion of a beached whale. yeah, its kinda cool, but why'd the whale decide to leave the fabulous ocean for a gritty beach and what are we gonna do with it now that its here?*SPOILER*They kill off Bourne's only friend/lover right off the bat- supposedly to give him motivation to fight kick and scratch his way to the truth... the painfully obvious, heavy handed, and slow moving truth...

As many people would agree, riding on the back of a box office hit is usually an effort to make more cash, and as a result, the quality of the sequel reflects this. Not so with The Bourne Supremacy. In many ways it's better than the first, in terms of tight editing, Damon's overall performance, and that over the top car chase through the streets of Moscow, at the end of the film, which had me gripping the arm rests of my seat.Matt Damon was recently here in Melbourne promoting the film and he worked hard, appearing on every major Australian talk show as well as several popular morning radio stations. Australians like Matt Damon because he comes across as honest, no pretenses, your average all-American clean cut young man. In fact I remember him saying in one of his interviews that he was hesitant to do the sequel because he was afraid the quality of the film would suffer, but he ended up agreeing to do the project when he found out who would be directing. Paul Greengrass did a fine job, as the realism of the picture is first rate. Originally a documentary filmmaker, he brought his sense of realism to the project. Some have commented that the editing was too tight, jagged in places, almost acting as a distraction.

As a result, there is a scene toward the end that occurs between Bourne and a teenage girl that is unexpectedly moving.Other bonuses: Damon is strong as ever, taking a minimalist approach that somehow manages to convey both Bourne's emotional self and his taciturn nature. Also, the action itself never flags, and the plot details are nicely complex.There is one warning that I'd give new viewers: director Paul Greengrass utilizes the shaky, hand held camera technique.

Also appearing is Joan Allen (Pleasantville), Karl Urban (The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King), and Karel Roden, who appeared in the dreadful 2001 film 15 Minutes, starring Robert De Niro (need more proof that De Niro is certainly not exempt from bad films?  Go check out his recent, abysmal outing in Godsend...I had to go see Raging Bull after that one to reaffirm the fact that his is one of the greatest assets in Hollywood).The film begins with Jason (Damon) and Marie (Potente) residing `off the grid' (this term is used a few times...I thought it was kinda cool) somewhere in India.  Jason's having nightmares, enduring the side effects of his past assassin training, received during his tenure in the now defunct Treadstone project, which was basically a covert gooberment kill squad (all this is explained in the first film, so go see it).  He's still suffering from the fractal memory, but life is good...that is until an unfortunate event forces him to confront forces conspiring to use his existence for their own, nefarious means.  After one of CIA director Pamela Landry's (Allen) mission's gets messed up, she forces the Treadstone files opened (evidence indicates a former member is the one that screwed up her operation), and the hunt for Bourne is on...but Bourne is already on the move, looking to make good on his promise he made in the previous film (see my first paragraph).  The board is set, the pieces are in play, and all we have to do is sit back and enjoy the show...I found a lot to like about this film...I suppose because the makers tended to stick to the formula that made the first one work.  Tony Gilroy returns with a smart, fast paced screenplay (he also did the first film), but previous director Doug Liman does not, instead taking the executive producing credit, allowing for Paul Greengrass to helm this sequel, who manages maintain much of the flavor of the original, but not without a few problems.  My biggest complaint (one shared by a few people, I see) is the seemingly constant shaking of the camera, which I've now dubbed the Greengrass Syndrome.  I read that this was done on purpose, through the use of handheld cameras, to present a gritty feel, but, as with just about anything, too much can be a bad thing.  Seriously, I was wondering if the cameraman suffering the delirium tremors, figuring he was a recovering alcoholic.  That aside, everything else worked.  I thought Damon did exceptionally well, and it now appears, within this burgeoning franchise, he is the archetypal Bourne character, much like Sean Connery and the Bond films.  Of course it didn't hurt being backed by a talented and experienced supporting cast featuring Cox and Allen.  The plot was fairly intricate, but if you stay with it, it will come clean in the end.  There's quite a bit going on, and it's not always put forth in a straightforward manner, but relayed in bits and pieces, requiring some effort (and patience) from the viewer.  I did think it a little odd that Bourne could elude his former agency as well as he did, seeing as how they were the ones who trained him, but then Allen's character within the film also brought up this point, creating a sense that the writer understood beforehand that some audience members would feel this, and gave us something to identify with in the movie (I am unsure if that will make sense, but my point is Gilroy is exceptional at his craft, having the ability to anticipate his audience, and allow for it within the story).  How much of Robert Ludlum's original story made it into the film?  I couldn't tell you, but I have read that, within the novel, much of the beginning took place with Bourne in a Indian prison (this wasn't the case in the film), but then after that the script and the original story align a bit more closely.  As far as the action goes, I wasn't wanting...I was impressed with the way the film was able to balance the elements of the story and maintain a high level of action, and my interest, throughout (this was also the case with the first film).  If you like car chase scenes, there's a real doozy in here, taking place in Moscow.  Was it as good as the one in the first film?  Pretty close (Bourne crashes a whole lot more), but the frenetic, trembling camera work detracted a little...alright, I won't mention the annoying camera work again, other than to ask Greengrass to accept the fact that one can create the desired level of tension and `grittiness' filming with a Steadicam by employing a series of quick cuts.The widescreen anamorphic picture (2.35:1) looks wonderful (the muted colors were the director's choice), and the sound is crystal clear.

Slipman,"[1, 7]","Matt Damon's reprisal of Jason Bourne in the rapidly paced ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and Paul Greengrass' direction resulted in a winning combination.  Loosely based on Ludlum's classic trilogy, Bourne is framed for killing two CIA agents in a bungled operation orchestrated by CIA bigwig Pamela Landy played by stone faced Joan Allen.  Concomitantly, Bourne is marked for assassination, while miles away in India, by Karl Urban playing a Russian secret service agent working at the behest of a smarmy Russian oil magnate.  Still suffering from amnesia,  Bourne must determine why he is being marked by both the CIA and the Russians as he ambles through a travelogue of gorgeous European locales.The chaotic hand held camera work succeeded in adding to the excitement of the chase and pursuit scenes.  John Powell's musical score was also very effective in establishing the everchanging moods of the flick.  As in the prequel ""The Bourne Identity"" the movie contains an awesome auto chase scene which boggled my mind imagining how it was filmed.

852994,A51IK68MWKV5R,B0002ZDVEU,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[3, 4]","Amnesiac Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) just can't seem to get a break. Relocated to India with girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente of Run Lola Run), his idyllic life is broken by yet another assassination attempt (it has to fail or we wouldn't have a movie). Chases and vengeance ensue as the story geographically covers Berlin, Moscow, and Naples.The Bourne Supremacy is the sequel to 2002's The Bourne Identity (from the second novel in the Bourne trilogy by Robert Ludlum; an adaptation of The Bourne Ultimatum will inevitably follow). Bourne is truly a man of mystery: he doesn't even know who he is, only that he once was a paid assassin for the now-defunct Treadstone Project. He thought he was in the clear, but this brings him back out of hiding to defend himself and try to find out why is again a target. On the side of the CIA are Pamela Landy (Joan Allen, in the kind of role she was meant to play), Ward Abbott (the always wonderfully villainous Brian Cox), and, for a short time, the beautiful Julia Stiles as Bourne's former contact in Paris, Nicky (she plays utterly terrified like I've never seen).Director Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday) takes over from Bourne Identity's Doug Liman (who stayed on as producer) and gives Supremacy a kinetic style that occasionally veers into the eye-jarring. The use of quick cuts makes chases and fights viscerally exciting, but doesn't allow us to really watch the action. It feels like we're being thrown right along with Bourne, which was probably the idea, but it also makes it seem like the filmmakers are hiding something like their inability to capture a good master shot.The script is mostly a medium for government two-stepping and action set pieces, not that I'm complaining. My favorite involves a crowd scene in Berlin when Damon meets up with Stiles as the agency tries to keep them in their sights so they can kill him. A group of protesters, a slow-moving tram, and Bourne's ingenuity contrive to foil their efforts and Stiles gets her aforementioned terror scene in a side room in the subway. The combination of sound, visuals, editing, and the acting of Damon and Stiles offer quite a lot in the way of entertainment. The film is obviously left open for a sequel (after all, there is a third book to film) but ends on a high note as Landy gives Jason his real name and birth date.I don't usually get into this kind of spy thriller, but Damon's engaging persona makes Jason Bourne instantly likable and the terrific cast is a joy to watch in their various roles. The most interesting part, though, is watching as Bourne begins to remember details about his past work. He attempts to make the amends he can and then moves on to the next chase, as the agency is always just a half-step behind him. The music accompanying all this is somewhat reminiscent of the aforementioned Run Lola Run soundtrack, with the closer from Moby being a particular standout. All in all, The Bourne Supremacy is a popcorn movie of the highest order. Just make sure to get a big enough soda to wash down all that compulsively-shoveled-in treat.",5,A popcorn movie of the highest order,1092700800,"08 17, 2004",2004,3083,"['Amnesiac', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'break', 'Relocated', 'India', 'girlfriend', 'Marie', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'idyllic', 'life', 'broken', 'yet', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'fail', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie', 'Chases', 'vengeance', 'ensue', 'story', 'geographically', 'Berlin', 'Moscow', 'Naples.The', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'sequel', '2002', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'second', 'novel', 'Bourne', 'trilogy', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'adaptation', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'will', 'inevitably', 'follow', 'Bourne', 'truly', 'man', 'mystery', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'who', 'only', 'once', 'was', 'paid', 'assassin', 'now-defunct', 'Treadstone', 'Project', 'thought', 'was', 'clear', 'back', 'hiding', 'defend', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'again', 'target', 'side', 'CIA', 'are', 'Pamela', 'Landy', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'kind', 'role', 'was', 'meant', 'play', 'Ward', 'Abbott', 'always', 'wonderfully', 'villainous', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'short', 'time', 'beautiful', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Bourne', 'former', 'contact', 'Paris', 'Nicky', 'utterly', 'terrified', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', '.Director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'Bloody', 'Sunday', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'who', 'stayed', 'producer', 'Supremacy', 'kinetic', 'style', 'occasionally', 'eye-jarring', 'use', 'quick', 'cuts', 'chases', 'fights', 'viscerally', 'exciting', ""n't"", 'allow', 'really', 'watch', 'action', ""'re"", 'being', 'thrown', 'right', 'Bourne', 'was', 'probably', 'idea', 'also', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'hiding', 'something', 'inability', 'capture', 'good', 'master', 'shot.The', 'script', 'mostly', 'medium', 'government', 'two-stepping', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'not', ""'m"", 'complaining', 'favorite', 'crowd', 'scene', 'Berlin', 'when', 'Damon', 'up', 'Stiles', 'agency', 'keep', 'sights', 'can', 'kill', 'group', 'protesters', 'slow-moving', 'tram', 'Bourne', 'ingenuity', 'contrive', 'foil', 'efforts', 'Stiles', 'aforementioned', 'terror', 'scene', 'side', 'room', 'subway', 'combination', 'sound', 'visuals', 'editing', 'acting', 'Damon', 'Stiles', 'offer', 'quite', 'lot', 'way', 'entertainment', 'film', 'obviously', 'left', 'open', 'sequel', 'third', 'book', 'film', 'high', 'note', 'Landy', 'Jason', 'real', 'name', 'birth', 'date.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'get', 'kind', 'spy', 'thriller', 'Damon', 'engaging', 'persona', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'instantly', 'likable', 'terrific', 'cast', 'joy', 'watch', 'various', 'roles', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'watching', 'Bourne', 'remember', 'details', 'past', 'work', 'make', 'amends', 'can', 'then', 'moves', 'next', 'chase', 'agency', 'always', 'just', 'half-step', 'music', 'accompanying', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'aforementioned', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'soundtrack', 'closer', 'Moby', 'being', 'particular', 'standout', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'highest', 'order', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'big', 'enough', 'soda', 'wash', 'down', 'compulsively-shoveled-in', 'treat']",N/A

Plus, some great actors.It helps to know the first movie in which the ""hero"" is an ex-CIA agent who, having lost his memory, doesn't recall who he is and why he is being hunted down by friend and foe alike. There are a few great car chases scenes in here but some of the other action stretches credibility as there is no way ""Bourne"" could elude his captors as he did several times here...but it's fun to watch anyway.The herky-jerky camera style may put some viewers off watching this DVD but after I adjusted to it, I didn't mind.

852996,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B0002ZDVEU,Craig MACKINNON,"[0, 0]","The first time through the Bourne Supremacy, I was convinced it was better than the first.  The story and pacing were tighter.  There seemed to be fewer plot inconsistencies.  Unfortunately, there were still a couple of nagging points that, on second watching, are so egregious as to take you out of the supposedly ""realistic"" action.  In a film with a lower realism standard, the mistakes would be forgivable, but not in a film like this were everything depends on the credibility of the action.First, the good points.  The DVD picture and sound are great.  The jerky camera movements and editing style enhance the viewing experience (but I can understand how those watching it in a theatre might come away motion-sick).  There are a few scenes of sublime brilliance - when Bourne tracks Joan Allen's character, the latter parts of the Moscow car chase (in the tunnel), Bourne threatening the Julia Stiles character.  These scenes highlight the intense action and energy of both the action set-pieces and the acting, which is top-rate throughout.Unfortunately, there are some of major problems: (a) there are too many (and overlong) car chases.  I like a good car chase as much as the next guy, but there's no way that poor car of Bourne's could still be running after all it's been through in the second chase scene.  Again, in a less ""realistic"" movie, it could be forgiven, but not here.  And wouldn't it have been more fun if the taxi he stole was a Lada instead of a Mercedes (as with the Mini in the first film)?  (b) By having Jason be alone through the film, there is little opportunity for character development because he has no one to talk with.  Granted, Matt Damon does a good job with his face and body language, but it's not the same.  (c) Most critically - why OH WHY?!? is the fight scene with the other CIA assassin in this film?  Nothing about the scene makes sense - How does Bourne know he exists? how does Bourne find him? why does he attack Bourne? why does Bourne kill him?  Obviously, the director (or writer?) decided the film needed a big hand-to-hand combat scene, and cooked this scene up even though it makes no sense.  In a Jackie Chan movie, this scene would be fine.  In this movie, it's like a comedy cartoon stuffed into the middle of a drama.The extras on the DVD are somewhat entertaining, including some cut scenes which look like they were cut for good reason.",3,"Probably a better story, marred by some unnecessary gaffs",1124755200,"08 23, 2005",2005,2400,"['first', 'time', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'was', 'convinced', 'was', 'better', 'first', 'story', 'pacing', 'were', 'tighter', 'seemed', 'be', 'fewer', 'plot', 'inconsistencies', 'Unfortunately', 'were', 'still', 'couple', 'nagging', 'points', 'second', 'watching', 'are', 'so', 'egregious', 'take', 'supposedly', 'realistic', 'action', 'film', 'lower', 'realism', 'standard', 'mistakes', 'would', 'be', 'forgivable', 'not', 'film', 'were', 'everything', 'depends', 'credibility', 'action.First', 'good', 'points', 'DVD', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'great', 'jerky', 'camera', 'movements', 'editing', 'style', 'enhance', 'viewing', 'experience', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'watching', 'theatre', 'might', 'come', 'away', 'motion-sick', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'sublime', 'brilliance', 'when', 'Bourne', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'character', 'latter', 'parts', 'Moscow', 'car', 'chase', 'tunnel', 'Bourne', 'threatening', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'character', 'scenes', 'highlight', 'intense', 'action', 'energy', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'acting', 'top-rate', 'throughout.Unfortunately', 'are', 'major', 'problems', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'overlong', 'car', 'chases', 'good', 'car', 'chase', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'guy', 'way', 'poor', 'car', 'Bourne', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'running', 'been', 'second', 'chase', 'scene', 'Again', 'less', 'realistic', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'not', 'here', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fun', 'taxi', 'stole', 'was', 'Lada', 'instead', 'Mercedes', 'Mini', 'first', 'film', 'b', 'having', 'Jason', 'be', 'alone', 'film', 'little', 'opportunity', 'character', 'development', 'one', 'talk', 'Granted', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'good', 'job', 'face', 'body', 'language', 'not', 'same', 'c', 'Most', 'critically', 'why', 'OH', 'WHY', 'fight', 'scene', 'other', 'CIA', 'assassin', 'film', 'Nothing', 'scene', 'sense', 'How', 'Bourne', 'know', 'how', 'Bourne', 'find', 'why', 'attack', 'Bourne', 'why', 'Bourne', 'kill', 'Obviously', 'director', 'writer', 'decided', 'film', 'needed', 'big', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'scene', 'cooked', 'scene', 'up', 'even', 'sense', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movie', 'scene', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'movie', 'comedy', 'cartoon', 'stuffed', 'middle', 'drama.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'including', 'cut', 'scenes', 'look', 'were', 'cut', 'good', 'reason']",N/A

Partly, the movie studio wanted to avoid its controversial content (assassination of a Chinese vice-premier) and opted for an albeit, lamer botched up CIA operation that claimed the lives of two CIA agents.Matt Damon, with his deadpan performance as Jason Bourne, disappears into the role of the super spy completely. Totally absorbed and with a single-tracked spartan approach to pursuing his often faceless enemies, Bourne wrecked havock through the continent of Europe, climaxing with the most thrilling bumper car chase this summer has to offer.This DVD seemed to be a good buy.

They're both in here all over the place and I have my own qualms with them.  But honestly, folks, does this make or break the film for you?  If anything, I believe that all of the commentary on the ""shaky-cam"" techniques points to a far deeper problem lurking in THE BOURNE SUPREMACY: the lack of a logical and interesting plotline.  Sure, there are some pluses in this film.  I really enjoy watching Matt Damon as an action/spy hero.  He's good at it and believable.  I love seeing him take out squadrons of men with a few martial arts moves and escape from impossible situations with ease and flare.  He handles the dueling characteristics of brains and brawn quite well and can also handle women.  I just wish that he would do so inside of a film that made sense and was interesting.Of course, I am not asking for a completely realistic action film.  Such a thing is impossible, perhaps, and would be boring if it were actually accomplished.  No...what I ask for is simply an entertaining action storyline that flows from point-to-point with logical grace and simplicity.  Much of the storyline in THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is simply hard to follow and extraneous.  We love to see our action hero fighting against the best of the best.  We just want to know why he is doing it.I honestly hope that we have not seen the last of Jason Bourne.  Matt Damon is very interesting to watch and I feel that with a better plotline this series can be recovered.  If you enjoyed THE BOURNE IDENTITY, you'll want to check out this film.

Those of us who live our lives in the sunlit spaces of what we call ""Normalcy"" don't have a clue about the deep, dark, furiously deadly undertows all about us.Most do their 9-to-5 routine, pay their bills, take care of their taxes in an annual routine of Dread, nurture families, make and break friendships, launch and end affairs, and a million other exigencies of life, all while getting their food---caught, fattened, slaughtered, and packaged, ultimately bearing little resemblance to a beast or fowl---from well-stocked superstore shelves.We live in such a state, a highly unnatural state, because our Rulers have enlisted King Cobras to go forth and do our battles for us. Proxy warriors.They slip through the streets of a million metropolises, plumb the information oubliettes of a bilion backwater dive-bars. They are professional Killers, and you'll only see one of them about 1/5th of a second before you breathe your last breath.As one CIA analyst says, ""these people do not make mistakes."" They don't have time to: the world they do their bloody business in is fast and brutal, operates by the Law of the Microchip, and is unforgiving as Hell.James Bond? Please. By the time Bond was halfway through one of his droll quips he'd be dead in the real world.Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, whose Bourne is both kinetically, cracklingly alive and still calm and calculating), until recently, was one of those King Cobras.Still suffering from partial amnesia, not wholly confident in what he may have done for the infamous CIA ""Treadstone Project"", haunted by nightmares, Bourne and girlfriend Marie (the lush Franka Potente) are a world away from the events of ""Bourne Identity"", submerged beneath new names (though not faces, alas), tucked away in a remote corner of India.Except, as Bourne finds out, when a Berlin CIA operation goes bad and Trouble comes calling with hollow points, there ain't any such thing as remote.Framed for a murder he didn't commit, implicated by fingerprints that aren't his, dimly suspicious that Treadstone may still be up and running and looking for blood, Bourne runs himself to ground in Naples, using his own passport---and the Hunt is on.Both ""Bourne"" movies are prime examples of how *to* make a good espionage thriller: ""Supremacy"" is smart, fast, edgy, and deadly, like a John Le Carre novel told from a field agent's point of view. There is little, if any, margin for error: make a mistake, trigger the men in black *and* the local fuzz, and you won't be making it back to the hotel for a late night Martini, shaken not stirred.The plot? Suffice it to say that it involves Russian mobsters with Langley connections, and that it is partly about revenge and substantially about getting answers. That's all you really need to know.Like its predecessor, ""Supremacy"" is shot with skill and authority: like its cold-bloodedly efficient killers, ""Supremacy"" Director of Photography Oliver Wood doesn't have to plump up the material with showy techniques. His camera moves in for the kill, arcs over to its target, jounces along after the subject like a war photographer when it must, and gets the job done.It's amusing that some have complained about Wood's cinematography: he did the camera-work for ""Identity"", and (rejoice!) will be helming the shooting for ""Bourne Ultimatum"". I'm not a big fan of jerky camera-work and so I was bracing myself for this film; with a widescreen print of the film and a proper widescreen TV, the only time the camera bounces around is when it wants to enhance the action.Ultimate credit goes to Peter Greengrass, who takes the directorial duties away from ""Identity""'s director Eric Lyman. Greengrass has a fine sense of what works, and subordinates everything in ""Supremacy""---the use of lighting, the frenzied chases through Berlin, Naples, and Moscow, the actors, even the soundtrack and camerawork---to serve the movie's overarching objective.A good example---one of my favorites in ""Supremacy""---is Bourne's brutal melee with former Treadstone spook Jarda (Martin Csokas): no soundtrack, totally edgy, very raw, two trained killers beating each other to death (one handcuffed!) with whatever means are available.The camerawork moves with the two fighters---not stagey at all, this is not a Bond fight---but the more organic perspective serves to bring you into this duel to the death.Another thing I respect about ""Supremacy"": the absolute lack of lard on this bad boy. In this era of cinematic bloat, the crucial job of editing---what to cut, what to leave in, and how to cut scenes to maximize dramatic effect---isn't always appreciated.""Supremacy"" succeeds because it has no body-fat: every scene must tell, which makes you care about Jason Bourne all the more. Congrats to Christopher Rouse (from ""Identity"") and Richard Pearson for editing ""Supremacy"" so tight you could practically hear the film scream.Those who grooved on the helter-skelter chase sequences of ""Identity"" will relish Greengrass's serving up more of the same---only Greengrass ups the ante, both in terms of the pursuit, but also in terms of the fiendish inventiveness---and deadliness---of Jason Bourne himself, the Pursued. The chase through nocturnal Berlin is one of the craziest things I've ever seen on screen, and a true nail-biter.All the acting is note-perfect: Damon is tightly focused---but torn---Angel of Death, Karl Urban (Kirill) shines as his furiously efficient nemesis, Brian Cox looks fatter and more anxious as CIA spook Ward Abbott, and Joan Allen is all business as the new CIA Deputy Director.Taut, gripping, brutally paced, ""Bourne Supremacy"" is as merciless as a drive-by shooting and as cool as the metal on a silencer at 3 AM on a Siberian morning.

So, when home from college on this Christmas break,  he agrees to spend two hours with us around the second of his preferred triad of films, we seize the moment by its skinny little cinematic throat.Two hours later ... Wow!Matt Damon's 'Jason Bourne' won't go away from the stained recall of compromised CIA operatives and Russian oil cartel-istas, won't go away from an amnesiac operative's self-identification-screen to let him get back to his original self, and now won't go away from our home-movie enthusiasm.Bring on the prequel, let us have the sequel!  I see some quick Amazon orders of used DVDs in our (very near) future.The plot will be well-known to readers of this review or, alternatively, available from myriad reviews. Let me point my minutes at softer targets:(a) The pace: this movie you up from start to finish. There is not a moment to rest. Plot-challenged viewers like this reviewer will want to make careful mental note of the spare fingerprint and such.(b) The music: John Powell's soundtrack cooperates beautifully with the plot. If you normally experience film music merely at the subliminal level, this would be a good film on which to bring it up the level of consciousness. I plan to buy (and review) the soundtrack. 'Very strong music.(c) Acting: Damon is superb. But don't miss Brian Cox as the tortured and slightly repugnant Ward Abbot, who just wants to enjoy his hard-earned influence for another year before retiring to a couple of consultancies.

Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) lives in Goa with his girlfriend (Franka Potente), trying to piece his past together with snippets of dreams and memories that he writes in a scrapbook.  When their quiet life is shattered by the appearance of an assassin, Bourne is thrust back into his old life of intrigue and danger.The intelligence behind the script keeps this film moving forward at a rapid, engaging clip, but the cinematography can be downright confusing.  One massive car chase is so dizzying that it is impossible to tell what is going on:  it's like watching three card Monty with a hundred cards, and you lose track of where people are.  Despite this, car chase fans will love the exhilarating screech of metal against metal, with cars flying everywhere.  The many plot levels that the film explores - the CIA's pursuit, Bourne's struggle to remember who he was, the assassins operating on their own agenda - keeps the viewer's interest from start to finish.  Damon does a good job of imbuing Bourne with a small amount of humanity struggling to assert itself.This film belongs to Matt Damon, and Damon fans won't be disappointed.

It's certainly not realistic - in case he hasn't noticed, people's eyes adjust focus naturally, so the constant needless shifts of focus were just moronic and totally unjustifiable - and it really did feel that the whole movie had been shot by an epileptic monkey on roller skates.

853015,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B0002ZDVEU,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[5, 9]","Ah, Jason Bourne.  Matt Damon was BOURNE to have such a great role.  His character was BOURNE amnesiac, but BOURNE to be a hardcore fighting machine.  He's BOURNE to provide good mix of espionage and action.  And he's BOURNE to bring the best of what this movie has to offer.~REVIEW~""The Bourne Supremacy"" is the second chapter of an already-popular spy-thriller series based on the best-selling books by Robert Ludlum.  Jason Bourne is back once again, beating up bad guys that get in his way with such swift charisma and a stealth ability of Sam Fisher, all in a grave search to find his unknown identity.  Whether or not he does find his true credentials., what I find in this a much deeply-plotted movie that brought my attention to its qualities that, in its rarest form, make it much better than the original.  It's a BOURNE fact, moviegoers.It's been a while since the original took place, and an espionage objective has occurred in Berlin thanks to the people of the CIA.  Their objective backfired, though, cause someone killed the people involve in the spy mission.  Meanwhile in India, Jason and his girlfriend, Marie, were taking it easy on the simple Hindu land after their previous adventure, or are they, `cause Jason's keep having terrible dreams about his blurry past.  Sadly, the past comes back at him, as he and his girl are on the road to get away from a Russian hitman that's following them, and the hitman killed Marie and their jeep landed on a river from the bridge, presumably dead.  What the hitman didn't know is that Bourne is still alive and he's furious enough for revenge.  Too bad one objective leads to another, because Bourne's also on the run from the CIA, who thinks the one that killed the operatives in the spy mission is him.  So now he must find the enemies that tried to assassinate him while clearing his name for murder.A fan's way of speaking: Bourne can kick Bond's sleazy *ouch*.  This sequel really brought out more character to the main guy.  On ""Identity"", I see him as a kung-fu amnesiac with plenty of arsenal and essentials; I didn't see him any different that any other movie spy out there.  But in ""Supremacy"", he was BOURNE to be a distinct person.  Even when he lost his loved one, he didn't go off and get another one during the whole movie; he isn't a womanizer like that certain popular British agent.  Plus, he's doesn't always keep his cool.  He's remorse about the things that happen, and confused about things he doesn't understand.  With such character development,  I started to appreciate him more, and find him much favorable.This movie is BOURNE to be much more story-driven than it's predecessor (although I still think it's essential to watch the first movie before this).  As the plotlines builds up, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" will take Matt Damon in exotic continental lo-cals such as Germany, India, and Moscow.  During his busy time running away from the CIA and finding clues that would lead to the assassins` whereabouts, he treats himself with a little bit of flashback scenarios.  These scenarios play a key role in the movie, since they fill in a few gaps for Bourne's elusive past.  The story wouldn't be as engaging if people like me are expecting some action to coincide it, and there is.  I got to find out who is the fight choreographer in this movie, because I want to applaud him (or her) for having such unusual ideas to make these fighting scenes look so awesome and swift.  There's also a few B-rated car chases to add into its adrenaline mix (as if I care about those).  Okay, the action scenes aren't as well-balanced as the story, but they're still cool to watch.The actors here are pretty well-rounded, not to my surprise from the cold and serious Matt Damon.  Joan Allen does just as well as the CIA agent Pamela Landy who's looking for Bourne.  Julia Stiles makes her fine second appearance in the Bourne saga as Nicky, once again; too bad she doesn't have much of a role here.  If there's anything to say about the musical score, it's Moby's ""Extreme Ways"" during the ending credits.  The song just fits right for the intensity of the spy-thriller.  Other than that, the score's good but it sounded similar to the original.THE FINAL WORD: Substantial.  Simply put, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" brings the cake and adds some icing in it as well.  It proves so much substance, while still having the crazy style at the same time. Yep, this movie is BOURNE to attract people looking for a good spy-action movie for the summer; it has for me.

853018,A2WP0GOTX13MG4,B0002ZDVEU,"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff""","[0, 0]","'The Bourne Supremacy' follows the life of Jason Bourne after the events of the preceeding movie 'The Bourne Identity.'  Jason Bourne, played by Matt Damon, and his girlfriend Marie, played by Franka Potente, have moved around the world to keep away from Jason's past.  They've run to India, and the past they tried so hard to avoid has caught up with them.  Suddenly, Jason is thrown back into the life of a covert operative that he has tried so desperately to get away from....This movie is good but flawed.  Amongst its strengths are a strong ensemble and good acting.  Matt Damon has nailed this character.  Bourne doesn't look like a guy capable of espionage or assasination, and that is partly due to Damon's portrayal.  He pulls it off beautifully.  Brian Cox, Julia Stiles, and Joan Allen also contribute admirable performances to the movie.Another strength are the tactics employed by Bourne.  The character is built up to be a resourceful assasination, and this portrayal is made convincing by having Bourne do clever and resourceful things.  For instance, watch how he tracks down Joan Allen's character, or how he baits the CIA into putting their men right where he wants them.Unfortunately, the movie has its pitfalls.  First off, 'Supremacy' feels almost more like a remake of 'Identity' than it does its own film.  The amnesia subplot predominates this movie in the same exact way that it did the first.  Jason knows he did something, is not sure what, but it has covert operatives chasing him.  Sound familiar?  It should if you have seen the first film.Second, the timing of the plot.  The first half of the movie rolls along nicely.  The plot develops and when it is not developing, there are well placed action scenes demonstrating Jason's combat prowess and his resourcefulness.  However, after that, the second half of the movie is really just Jason marching towards the conclusion, which would be fine if it weren't for the third problem...The third problem is the much maligned camera work.  The action scenes in this movie were really pretty good.  At least the ones that were coherently filmed were.  It seems the the film was shot using hand held cameras that were operated by camera men running to keep up with the actors.  Frequently, the action becomes indistinguishable.  The point is, the action scenes were good enough that they didn't need this primitive filming style to make them more exciting.All in all its a decent film.  I liked some of the action better than in the first film.  However, the story of the first film was better.  The DVD has plenty of bonus features for the enthusiast.  I'd recommend this movie to fans of the first film, and as a rental to those that like spy thrillers and action movies.  I'll catch it again if it comes on cable, but I'm not adding it to my collection.",3,"Good Movie, but More of the Same",1107475200,"02 4, 2005",2005,2829,"['Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'life', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'events', 'preceeding', 'movie', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'girlfriend', 'Marie', 'played', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'have', 'moved', 'world', 'keep', 'away', 'Jason', 'past', ""'ve"", 'run', 'India', 'past', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'avoid', 'caught', 'up', 'Suddenly', 'Jason', 'thrown', 'back', 'life', 'covert', 'operative', 'tried', 'so', 'desperately', 'get', 'away', '.This', 'movie', 'good', 'flawed', 'Amongst', 'strengths', 'are', 'strong', 'ensemble', 'good', 'acting', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'nailed', 'character', 'Bourne', ""n't"", 'look', 'guy', 'capable', 'espionage', 'assasination', 'partly', 'due', 'Damon', 'portrayal', 'off', 'beautifully', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'also', 'contribute', 'admirable', 'performances', 'movie.Another', 'strength', 'are', 'tactics', 'employed', 'Bourne', 'character', 'built', 'up', 'be', 'resourceful', 'assasination', 'portrayal', 'made', 'convincing', 'having', 'Bourne', 'do', 'clever', 'resourceful', 'things', 'instance', 'watch', 'how', 'down', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'character', 'how', 'CIA', 'putting', 'men', 'right', 'where', 'them.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'pitfalls', 'First', ""'Supremacy"", 'feels', 'almost', 'more', 'remake', ""'Identity"", 'own', 'film', 'amnesia', 'subplot', 'movie', 'same', 'exact', 'way', 'did', 'first', 'Jason', 'did', 'something', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'covert', 'operatives', 'chasing', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'film.Second', 'timing', 'plot', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'rolls', 'nicely', 'plot', 'develops', 'when', 'not', 'developing', 'are', 'well', 'placed', 'action', 'scenes', 'demonstrating', 'Jason', 'combat', 'prowess', 'resourcefulness', 'However', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'really', 'just', 'Jason', 'marching', 'conclusion', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'were', ""n't"", 'third', 'problem', 'third', 'problem', 'much', 'maligned', 'camera', 'work', 'action', 'scenes', 'movie', 'were', 'really', 'pretty', 'good', 'least', 'ones', 'were', 'coherently', 'filmed', 'were', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'using', 'hand', 'held', 'cameras', 'were', 'operated', 'camera', 'men', 'running', 'keep', 'up', 'actors', 'Frequently', 'action', 'indistinguishable', 'point', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'good', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'primitive', 'filming', 'style', 'make', 'more', 'exciting.All', 'decent', 'film', 'liked', 'action', 'better', 'first', 'film', 'However', 'story', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'better', 'DVD', 'plenty', 'bonus', 'features', 'enthusiast', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'fans', 'first', 'film', 'rental', 'like', 'spy', 'thrillers', 'action', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'catch', 'again', 'cable', ""'m"", 'not', 'adding', 'collection']",N/A

Now he must find out who is trying to eliminate him. And find out why!Jason Bourne is still uncertain of who he is and where he came from. He is a government trained assassin and slowly regaining his memory. He must get answers from his boss and the top secret government program that put a hit on him. (Trenchmark) Jason Bourne is very intelligent and resourceful of his surroundings.  Corruption is rampant.  Who is going to clean up these loose ends?""Supremacy"" is action packed and filmed with the viewer in mind. This movie is filmed with close up action and cameras everywhere. This movie is a pure suspense thriller that fulfills the bill. Joan Allen (Pamela Landy), Julia Styles (Nicky), Karl Urban (Kirill) and Franka Potente (Marie) are outstanding in their supporting roles.I found out that the Director Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday, 2002) deliberately tries to get the viewer in each action scene. Handheld cameras where used a lot and Matt Damon did all of his stunts which makes this film entertaining.I recommend purchasing this DVD because of the behind the scenes commentary.What I liked the most of the bonus features were the ten minute featurettes of each subject matter. Topics like action fight scenes, Go-mobile (car chases), Explosives and what is it like filming in each country. All of these subjects were commented on by director, actors and producers. Kudos to the producers for filming in the actual city and country of location: Germany, India, Russia, Italy and United States.Most bonus features on DVDs contain one long ""Making of"" feature.

853025,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B0002ZDVEU,Douglas King,"[0, 0]","****1/2I am late getting on the ""Bourne"" bandwagon. I just watched the first two films in the series for the first time last weekend after years of avoiding them. My impression? That so far, the ""Bourne"" films deserve all of the praise and success that they've received.What we have here is an intelligent, engrossing, well-written, well-acted and well-directed action film that can be enjoyed by families and mainstream audiences, but that doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence. I have to give props ... pulling that off is not easy to do.In the second film of the series, ""The Bourne Supremacy"", Jason Bourne finds that, despite the fact that he still can't recall most of it, he cannot escape his past. Although managing for two years to live in seclusion with his girlfriend, he is drawn back into the violent world he tried to escape when he is hunted down by another ""Treadstone"" agent, who fails to murder Bourne but kills his girlfriend. (The underwater scene where Jason watches Marie's lifeless body float away is tender and beautifully sad). Bourne is then framed by the same corrupt CIA agent (Brian Cox) who used to run the ""Treadstone"" program that created Bourne, and Jason is forced to prove his innocence while still trying to figure out his past.Matt Damon is the thinking man's action hero, and a complete departure from the stereotypically cocky, wisecracking American hero type. In action, Bourne is precise, powerful and unstoppable, but when he's not, Damon plays him with the stoic vulnerability of a man who wants desperately to escape the violent past he can barely remember. When Bourne tracks down the offspring of a politician he assassinated in his former life, the scene is heartbreakingly restrained.

Gritty, realistic, creative and so fast moving it will leave you gasping for breath. Matt Damon excels as Jason Bourne, ex-Company officer and covert terminator with a sixth sense for danger and almost superhuman powers of observation and recall. The fight scene with another officer from the defunct ""Treadstone Project"" is gut wrenching in its intensity and realism as the two adversaries fight to the death like modern gladiators..but here there is no Colosseum. Using improvised weapons from rolled up magazines to telephone wires and kitchen knives, the garotting scene may leave some sick to the stomach but the undeniable realism and superb acting is really outstanding. The way Bourne blows up the house with a newspaper and bread toaster as an improvised time bomb is very impressive, although the explosion is over dramatised a la Hollywood. Note that when bullets hit metal in real life, no sparks are emitted; that too is pure Hollywood. Bourne is the clean cut straight American Eagle scout, who in serving his country in the back alleys of the world has become almost Frankenstein's monster, and in many scenes the anguish of the tortured character comes through. His two hand grip of the handguns he uses in the Weaver stance is very professional, and the icy coldness as he carries out his daunting task to avenge his wife and clear his name is very true to life. When it comes to life and death, emotions have no place and only serve to distract one from the task ahead. Bourne's multi-lingual capabilities also help him to survive as he travels all over Europe with a mulititude of false passports and identities. As in all good spy thrillers, nothing is what it seems, so be prepared for the twists and turns of the convoluted plot. The on location scenes in Germany are excellent and the acting of the supporting actors and actresses are well directed. Not since Steve MacQueen's Bullit have I seen such a good no hold barred car chase through the streets of Moscow. The funky music is not all that great but it is not too bad either. The somewhat alcoholic Russian FSB assassin not only needs a shave but is very grumpy and bad tempered. No wonder he got killed. Such lack of control can only lead to failure. German actress Franka Potente of ""Run, Lola Run"" fame is killed off early and so Bourne is left with no love interest for the rest of the movie. Her death leaves him so sad that no tears are shed but his grief shows in his steely determination to exact retribution and get justice for both of them. This espionage movie has no love angle to get in the way or distract from the fast paced action. Please catch this movie when you feel your life is boring. It will put some excitement back into your life. The best part is all the bad guys get to die...horribly. Well, as they say, God will always give us Justice, one way or another. Enjoy!

The story does a fine job of picking up on the dangling threads of the original and wrapping them all up into a rewarding, conclusive finale. There was a bit too much shaky-cam in the action scenes for my liking, but this was in theaters when the concept was still fresh and it does lend a slightly more believable look and feel than you'll get from the classic polished Hollywood fights.",5,Best of the Bournes,1297987200,"02 18, 2011",2011,984,"['Doing', 'away', 'whole', 'hand-holding', 'innocent', 'civilian', 'tagalong', 'effect', 'slowed', 'original', 'sequel', 'Jason', 'outsmarting', 'entire', 'black', 'wing', 'US', 'government', 'turn', 'premise', 'set', 'completely', 'first', 'movie', 'Supremacy', 'free', 'quit', 'worrying', 'setup', 'dive', 'right', 'action', 'weighty', 'plot', 'developments', 'noted', 'several', 'scenes', 'were', 'more', 'coincidentally', 'similar', 'original', 'were', 'amped', 'up', 'couple', 'notches', 'paired', 'enough', 'original', 'material', 'retain', 'unique', 'identity', 'pun', 'intended', 'story', 'fine', 'job', 'picking', 'up', 'dangling', 'threads', 'original', 'wrapping', 'up', 'rewarding', 'conclusive', 'finale', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'shaky-cam', 'action', 'scenes', 'liking', 'was', 'theaters', 'when', 'concept', 'was', 'still', 'fresh', 'lend', 'slightly', 'more', 'believable', 'look', 'feel', ""'ll"", 'get', 'classic', 'polished', 'Hollywood', 'fights']",N/A

There is nothing wrong with using the hand-held technique (there is a grittiness and realism to hand-held camera work), as long as one doesn't over do it.  A little goes a long, long way, especially on the big screen.  Fortunately, watching the BOURNE SUPREMACY on a TV screen didn't give me the headache I had in the theater.  It's really a shame the director didn't realize this, because overall, he did a heck of a job.  He kept the tension throughout, the fight with the other Treadstone agent was great, and the car chase was spectacular (including the camera angles within the car itself) ... that is ... if we could have actually seen these scenes!The Bourne series has terrific potential, and I really like Matt Damon's presentation of this super agent.  You can see this guy thinking all the time, no matter what mundane task he is doing (walking, talking, eating, etc.).  There seems to be a million things flying inside Bourne's head every minute of the day and it's a pleasure to watch.  It also doesn't hurt that there is something extremely compelling about a man on the run, and it's always been that way (cue in a hundred movies and TV series here, beginning with THE FUGITIVE).So how do I rate this film?  Considering how much I enjoyed THE BOURNE IDENTITY, I'd say that SUPREMACY is actually better, except for the problems stated (that and the fact I was disappointed with an early plot decision concerning Marie).  I would easily have given this a 9 out of 10, or a 5-star rating if not for the camera work.  Still, the story is that good, the acting is very solid, the locations wonderful, and the tension remains strong enough throughout for me to give it 7 out of 10, or 4 stars.

853030,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B0002ZDVEU,D. S. Thurlow,"[3, 4]","Only rarely does a sequel equal its predecessor for entertainment value.  Very loosely based on a Robert Ludlum novel, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" does that, with a breathless stream of action sequences featuring the amnesiac but lethal former CIA assassin Jason Bourne (again played with a pitch-perfect combination of restraint and intensity by Matt Damon).As the movie opens, Bourne is hiding in a seaside village in India with his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente from the first movie).  He suffers from flashbacks of which he can make no sense, but he and Marie have built a life together.Four thousand miles away in Berlin, a CIA black operation supervised by CIA Deputy Director Pam Landy (a cooly precise Joan Allen) goes sideways when a mysterious assassin intervenes.  A fingerprint left behind leads Landy to Jason Bourne's identity.  Landy will mount a major operation to hunt down Bourne, enlisting the aid of TREADSTONE veterans Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) and Nikki Parsons (Julia Stiles) from the first movie.In India, the mysterious assassin from Berlin materializes to hunt Jason Bourne.  He narrowly misses Bourne but kills Marie.  A stoic Bourne returns to Europe on a collision course with the CIA and a shady plot involving a Russian oil magnate and a corrupt CIA insider.  The action will spin from India to Italy to Berlin and finally to Moscow, where a thrilling car chase will bring Bourne face to face with his Russian nemisis.The frantic, grainy, realistic cinematic style of the first movie is duplicated here, building suspense fasther than the viewer can worry about plot holes.  The core of the movie is Bourne's relentless pursuit of his objective, slowed only by his struggle to make sense of flashbacks and the need to bandage the odd wound.  The ending leaves plenty of room for additional sequels.This DVD version contains some interesting extra features about the making of the movie.

I am a Russian native and cannot understand a word of Russian spoken by Matt and Karl.  Why couldn't someone work with the actors to make the lines at least understandable, it's not like there is a whole conversation to carry, just a few lines/sentences...  I know it's nothing to those who do not understand Russian, but for me it's kind of a pesky issue, it takes me out of the story every time and I cant take them seriously at that moment.  That makes me curious - how well does Matt do with French and German(I think it was German?) ?  Is it at least understandable?  Or is it as bad as Russian?Last one - Matt Damon's makeup is too heavy.  It actually looks a lot better on this Blu-ray.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[5, 8]","The Bourne is back, as played by Matt Damon, in &quot;The Bourne Supremacy.&quot; While the story-line and characterization improve from the mediocre first movie of this proposed trilogy, Paul Greengrass's shakycam direction and Julia Stiles's tepid acting bog it back down.Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is in hiding with his leftover girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) in India, and he has the weirdest feeling that someone is after him. It turns out that he isn't just being paranoid -- a CIA agent turns up, and Jason and Marie try to escape. After losing Marie, Jason sets out in his former life as an assassin.Unfortunately, Bourne has somehow been framed for an assassination that, needless to say, he didn't carry out. Now he's a hunted man again, and he has to somehow clear his name and try to live in peace again. But with a ruthless agent on his tail (Karl Urban), his chances seem to be getting a lot slimmer.It takes awhile to figure out exactly what went on in this movie -- it's all quite confusing and needlessly enigmatic. But the core of the movie is Bourne kicking butt, and they manage to pull that off pretty well -- Damon isn't a steroid hulk, and the action scenes seem to be tailored to fit around him.Director Paul Greengrass seems to be under the impression that an MTV-style shakycam will give the film realism. Nope, just motion sickness. The constant jerking and wobbling are enough to make you dizzy. What's more, with the through-Bourne's-eyes method, we don't get to see half of what happens around him. Without the shakycam the film would have been far more enjoyable than it ended up being -- as it is, it just feels chaotic.Damon isn't a great actor, but he's obviously giving this role his best efforts, and he gives off a kind of cold, grim intensity that's well suited to the role. Franka Potente's limp, annoying presence drops out quickly, to be replaced by the tepid but passable presence of Julia Stiles. The stars here are Joan Allen, as a tightly wound CIA official, and the coldly menacing Karl Urban as Bourne's Russian counterpart.What would have been a moderately fun action flick is wrecked by the shakycam shooting style. &quot;Bourne Supremacy&quot; had promise, but on the silver screen it's suited best to people who don't get motion sick.",2,&quot;Bourne&quot; again,1090800000,"07 26, 2004",2004,2287,"['Bourne', 'back', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'quot', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy.', 'quot', 'story-line', 'characterization', 'improve', 'mediocre', 'first', 'movie', 'proposed', 'trilogy', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'shakycam', 'direction', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'tepid', 'acting', 'bog', 'back', 'down.Jason', 'Bourne', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'hiding', 'leftover', 'girlfriend', 'Marie', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'India', 'weirdest', 'feeling', 'someone', 'out', ""n't"", 'just', 'being', 'paranoid', 'CIA', 'agent', 'up', 'Jason', 'Marie', 'try', 'escape', 'losing', 'Marie', 'Jason', 'out', 'former', 'life', 'assassin.Unfortunately', 'Bourne', 'somehow', 'been', 'framed', 'assassination', 'needless', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'carry', 'out', 'Now', 'hunted', 'man', 'again', 'somehow', 'clear', 'name', 'try', 'live', 'peace', 'again', 'ruthless', 'agent', 'tail', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'chances', 'seem', 'be', 'getting', 'lot', 'slimmer.It', 'figure', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'went', 'movie', 'quite', 'confusing', 'needlessly', 'enigmatic', 'core', 'movie', 'Bourne', 'kicking', 'butt', 'manage', 'pull', 'off', 'pretty', 'well', 'Damon', ""n't"", 'steroid', 'hulk', 'action', 'seem', 'be', 'tailored', 'fit', 'him.Director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'be', 'impression', 'MTV-style', 'shakycam', 'will', 'give', 'film', 'realism', 'Nope', 'just', 'motion', 'sickness', 'constant', 'jerking', 'wobbling', 'are', 'enough', 'make', 'dizzy', 'What', 'more', ""through-Bourne's-eyes"", 'method', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'half', 'what', 'shakycam', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'just', 'feels', 'chaotic.Damon', ""n't"", 'great', 'actor', 'obviously', 'giving', 'role', 'best', 'efforts', 'off', 'kind', 'cold', 'grim', 'intensity', 'well', 'suited', 'role', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'limp', 'annoying', 'presence', 'drops', 'out', 'quickly', 'be', 'replaced', 'tepid', 'passable', 'presence', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'stars', 'here', 'are', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'tightly', 'CIA', 'official', 'coldly', 'menacing', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'Bourne', 'Russian', 'counterpart.What', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'moderately', 'fun', 'action', 'flick', 'wrecked', 'shakycam', 'shooting', 'style', 'quot', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'quot', 'had', 'promise', 'silver', 'screen', 'suited', 'best', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'motion', 'sick']",N/A

Unlike the first Bourne movie, there are a few slow spots here, and killing off Franka Potente during the first ten minutes of the film most DEFINITELY doesn't help matters whatsoever.In fact, this film is pretty much painting-by-numbers: we know full well that Bourne is going to be out to avenge his oh-so-cute German babe, and that again he is being framed for something he didn't do but that he will again prevail agaisnt all odds.  Even the fight scenes (there's only one really major one) are weak, and when we see him escape half of the Berlin police force by climbing up the side of a building yet AGAIN it's hard not to make another beer run.  While in some respects more spectacularly filmed due to Greengrass's documentary-making background than the one in the first film (through Paris), the Big Car Chase through the streets of Moscow also feels rehashed.Then there is the penultimate BIG DRAMATIC SCENE in which Bourne apologizes to one of his past victims...dialogue, acting, and camera are all wrong, and it's hard not to feel sorry for Matt Damon being stretched far beyond his limited abilities as an actor.If such things above don't bother you, chances are you'll enjoy this movie just fine.

(Although, the only worn out plot I hate worse than a conspiracy is the wrongfully accused man desperate to clear his name.  Or in Bourne's case, names.)The plot involves duping a particularly dense CIA Deputy Director (played with expected malice by Joan Allen) into believing Bourne has assassinated two men.  It takes incredible stupidity to frame someone who is clearly/verifiably somewhere else at the time of the killing, and to cover-up this fact, the same assassin tries to kill Bourne but kills his girlfriend instead (yes, that old chestnut.  Nothing like a stale plot ploy to get things rolling).  Basically, this plot is plug and play, utilizing similar (or the same) components from the last film in the same way here.  Joan Allen's dogged pursuit of Bourne is identical to that of Chris Cooper's character in the first film.  Brian Cox returns to do the same things he did in the first film only this time he's manipulating Allen instead of Cooper.  Julia Stiles returns to provide a convenient hostage (she completely disappears after her usefulness to the plot has been completed).  There are the usual flotilla of fight sequences, explosions, and car chases.  Bourne is still grappling with his identity and gaping holes in his memory.  Believing confession is good for the soul (if not later prosecution), Bourne even gives guilt a go.  The story is convoluted and rife with few surprises.

There's action sequences and car chases a plenty, and the graphic violence did force me to look away more than once, but then again I'm known for being squeamish.Overall I didn't find that this film lived up to its predecessor.  The plot wasn't as plausible, and at times the motives and actions of the various characters were somewhat confusing.  The hand-held camera work has been lauded as enhancing realism by evoking an improvisational and authentic feel, but I found the frantic and jerky movement and blurry vision excessive and hard to follow, to the point that it detracted from the flow of the narrative.  Here's a case where movie-makers have adopted a home video style and just gone a little too far overboard with the deliberate amateur feel.  But perhaps most significantly, Jason Bourne's character wasn't as sympathetic as it was in the Bourne Identity.  Even though there's a real sense of him being a victim of his circumstances and even his use of violence is mostly out of necessity rather than by personal choice, there's also a sense that he's more of a colder and more vengeful killing machine after tragically losing his lady, so it's harder to empathize with him.  It's still refreshing to see a film that doesn't go overboard with foul language and blasphemy (there were a few incidences of this, but it was minimal and even less than the first in the series), but as a follow-up this doesn't quite match the strength of the original.  - GODLY GADFLY",3,"Bourne again, but less than its predecessor",1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,1971,"['having', 'reasonably', 'enjoyed', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'how', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'story', 'Bourne', 'Marie', 'are', 'hiding', 'India', 'still', 'trying', 'recover', 'lost', 'memories', 'past', 'Bourne', 'soon', 'CIA', 'target', 'being', 'framed', 'killing', 'own', 'self-preservation', 'take', 'active', 'role', 'uncovering', 'secrets', 'Treadstone', 'hunters', 'order', 'discover', 'why', 'being', 'gunned', 'down', 'action', 'sequences', 'car', 'chases', 'plenty', 'graphic', 'violence', 'did', 'force', 'look', 'away', 'more', 'once', 'then', 'again', ""'m"", 'known', 'being', 'squeamish.Overall', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'film', 'lived', 'up', 'predecessor', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'plausible', 'times', 'motives', 'actions', 'various', 'characters', 'were', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'work', 'been', 'lauded', 'enhancing', 'realism', 'evoking', 'improvisational', 'authentic', 'feel', 'found', 'frantic', 'jerky', 'movement', 'blurry', 'vision', 'excessive', 'hard', 'follow', 'point', 'detracted', 'flow', 'narrative', 'Here', 'case', 'where', 'movie-makers', 'have', 'adopted', 'home', 'video', 'style', 'just', 'gone', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'overboard', 'deliberate', 'amateur', 'feel', 'perhaps', 'most', 'significantly', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'sympathetic', 'was', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'Even', 'real', 'sense', 'being', 'victim', 'circumstances', 'even', 'use', 'violence', 'mostly', 'necessity', 'rather', 'personal', 'choice', 'also', 'sense', 'more', 'colder', 'more', 'vengeful', 'killing', 'machine', 'tragically', 'losing', 'lady', 'harder', 'empathize', 'still', 'refreshing', 'see', 'film', ""n't"", 'go', 'overboard', 'foul', 'language', 'blasphemy', 'were', 'few', 'incidences', 'was', 'minimal', 'even', 'less', 'first', 'series', 'follow-up', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'strength', 'original', 'GODLY', 'GADFLY']",N/A

I don't think moviegoers really thought of Damon as an action star before 'Identity', but that's all changed now.  With 'The Bourne Supremacy' Damon does another turn as the troubled amnesiac spy/assassin Jason Bourne, and what a trip it is the second time around!This film is portrayed through the Bourne character's eyes and mind.  Everything moves at a breakneck on-the-fly pace, reflecting Bourne's reflexive reactions to unanticipated circumstances.  His near automatic responses seem able to get him out of almost any disaster-but Bourne is developing a consience, and feels guilty about some of his shadowy operations.Damon is joined by well-cast group of character actors such as Brian Cox, Julia Stiles, and Karl Urban as a Russian assassin.  They add real meat to the high octane mix of this film.I agree with other reviewers about the manic cutting and camera shake-it is disconcerting at times.  Apparently some directors feel it is 'artsy' to do this, but it is just an irritant in this case. Other than the camera work, this is a fine action film that owes a great deal to masters of the genre (John Frankenheimer comes to mind-this film reminded me of 'Ronin').I enjoyed this one even more than the first film, but have to subtract one star for the overediting and camera shake.

The Bourne franchise is not usually mentioned in this type of conversation, but Supremacy is a good example of it. Everything from the story, to the action, to the acting, to the intrigue, is kicked up a notch. The film brings Bourne into the proceedings while he is trying to enjoy an extended period of hiding with Marie from the agencies that are seeking to eliminate him. But, all good things must come to an end. Jason begins having terrible dreams, featuring quick bursts of scenes from his past, which of course he doesn't remember ever occurring. The CIA has found someone new to headline the tracking down of Bourne following Conklin's death in Identity. This is Pamela Landy, who is refreshingly all business, but very practical and rational. She is obviously the one best suited for the job, in that she can match anything Bourne can throw at them. But there is deadly intrigue in Landy's ranks also, in the form of Ward Abbott, Conklin's former boss. Since Conklin's death, he has seemingly thought it was all over because Bourne was dead or no longer a problem. Not so. Someone has framed two murders and the intentional botching of a CIA operation in Berlin on Bourne. He comes out of the shadows on a totally separate mission of vengeance, but before long, is drawn into an ever-so convoluted mission of clearing his name and figuring out how it all connects to his very first mission as an agent. As part of this, new -to-the-franchise director Paul Greengrass puts his own spin on the proceedings. His hyper-quick editing (especially during the action scenes) has been strongly criticized, but as I have mentioned before, I actually enjoy it. The editing gives the audience (and Bourne, presumably) the feeling of not knowing what's going on. Bourne is still suffering from amnesia, so he still doesn't really know where his training stems from. His reactions during such situations are only known to him, and we don't usually figure out what he's doing until it's already done. Bourne is not at all predictable or contrived as a character, which makes him so charismatic and easy to sympathize with. He doesn't truthfully know why or how he does what he does, he just does it. Therefore, during the action scenes, if one considers themselves a true fan, they must jump in and hang on for dear life. All the performances are terrific, with each one of the cast members getting at least one scene where they are allowed to shine. Supremacy is what results when we have seen Identity, and are therefore no longer needing introductions. We (somewhat) know who the characters are and what their involvement is in the story, and are now ready to get down to business.

I loved the first movie and the trailers to this one gave me the impression it was even better.  I was so let down.  The biggest complaint I have about this movie has to be the cinematography!  I was quickly irritated by the constant movement of the camera and anxiously waited for it to quit.  It never did.  In the action scenes the pitiful camera work was exaggerated 10 times.  I thought the chase scene was way too long and at times looked as if the camera was launched into a tornado and all you could see was debris flying by.  The music was irritating, too.  It was loud and spent several minutes at a climax.  The plot, aside from the rest of the obvious irritants, was sub-par and mediocre.  There wasn't much to hold my attention so I was consumed with boredom through much of the movie.  I really like Matt Damon and Julia Stiles, but this has to be the worst director they have worked under.  Julia Stiles' character just kind of disappeared midway through the movie.  Not enough dialogue and not enough story line!  I felt as if half the movie was one long chase scene.  Terrible, terrible movie.

Since Identity established that he had lots of passports with different names on them, it was surprising that they weren't utilized.

853074,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0002ZDVEU,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 8]","The USA and the world are obsessed by the CIA and other secret services and agencies that work in the wings of life under no control whatsoever. They circulate in the world as if they knew no borders, no limits and they carry on their business without considering in any way the people, the interest of the world itself. They have their objectives and it is to dominate and manipulate the powerful in the world and eliminate them if by any chance they became rowdy or rebellious. This film is no exception in the genre. An ex-agent from a totally secret group of  cleaners  has survived the end of his group and is hunted by some other secret agents, from Russia actually, to cover up an old operation that failed. This ex-agent is challenged in his  retirement  and gets back on the road to find the truth he has mostly forgotten and to eliminate those who are menacing him and have killed his woman-friend, his love. He finds out that the failed operation had been under scrutiny by the CIA and that he has been trapped into another failed operation. But this second failure was planned by the boss of the CIA himself because the documents the CIA was on the point of buying would have revealed his implication in the first failure as the one who organized the stealing of twenty million dollars by a future Russian oil-tycoon. His interest as the CIA boss was to push Russia into wild capitalism to undermine the power of the Russian state, and as an individual it was the financial kickbacks he got from this newly born oil tycoon. The ex-agent manages to go up the trail and get to him and, finding out what was his role in the first failure, he is able to force him to confess, on tape, and to commit suicide. Then he only had to evade the Russian secret services who are backing the oil-tycoon. He eliminates the agent who was tracking him, he apologizes to the daughter of the two people he executed in the first failed operation and he disappears again to finally come back to the new head of the CIA, the woman who had re-opened his file to find the truth about the first failed operation, and force her to classify his file and reveal him his true identity that he had forgotten due to the multiple identities he had had in his spying life. This film is pure action, and yet it entertains the vision of a democratic state that is totalitarian through some secret agencies that are there to prevent any change in the balance of power in our countries and in the world. Thus there seems to be some Big Brother behind the decor of our government from the people, for the people and by the people. The people appears in this film as a mass of non-significant puppets unconsciously strutting in the streets and other public places totally unaware of what is going on in their backs. And yet there is an escape for the ex-agent, an escape that is purely selfish and unethical because it protects him but reinforces the secret agency with the end of the challenge to it that he represented. It is a Big Brother that is multiplied into absolute and totally untouchable immunity. Frightening and sickening. And if it were true ? Stephen King, when dealing with such an agency, goes right through to destroying it, like in Firestarter. That is more reassuring for us : this secret agency can be challenged and curbed into some legality. In this film none of these ethics.

853075,ALJGB7XHPFCR,B0002ZDVEU,James R. Mckinley,"[4, 5]","This sequel to ""The Bourne Identity,"" had much less psychological tension. This time it's just chasing, fist fighting, and shooting. Most things that made ""Identity"" refreshing -- the wit, the incongruity, the uncertainty, the novelty of its premise -- are gone in "" Supremacy."" That isn't bad, but it is disappointing for anyone who remembers what made the first movie so enjoyable. Greengrass, who directed this sequel, couples his approach with two acute mistakes in strategy: He consistently forgets to clue the audience in on basic information, such as who is shooting at whom, and why. And he films every action scene as though doing a behind-the-camera interpretive dance based on Don Knotts' classic performance in ""The Shakiest Gun in the West."" That said, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is still definitely entertaining. More interestingly, it's a testament to Damon and what his physical presence somehow just conveys. The title, ""Supremacy,"" promises something it doesn't deliver, something further suggested by the advertising tagline, ""They should have left him alone."" The title suggests a reversal of the first movie, with Bourne, in possession of himself and the facts, mounting an offensive against the people who've victimized him. But the movie is really a muddle. Bourne is improvising, getting shot at here, strangling somebody there. He has no system. There's really no villain, unless you count some nameless Russian assassin or poor Abbott, who is too much of a nervous wreck to inspire an audience's bloodlust. This whole spectacle of confusion could have been made into something with some ironic distance. But the only distance Greengrass creates is that which comes of bad technique: wobbly images, and blurred fragments.

Matt Damon displays the lead character's uncanny ability to calmly think and plan his way out of a situation; he's never arrogant and he never grand stands. This makes this character more real and gives the circumstances in the movie more credibility than a normal run of the mill action movie.The reason why this sequel (and perhaps the third movie) is so good can be attributed to the basis of which these films were made, a pre-existing book series. This character wasn't revived to build a film franchise with a bunch of hack screenwriters just trying to make money. The story and character have a strong background already built in. Which was particularly important for Bourne Supremacy, because the action scenes were very hard to watch. The camera moves and cuts so much it's nauseating to watch. And even if you can stomach the movement it is hard to figure out what on earth is happening. This film could be the only action film I can think of where the film excelled despite it's action scenes.My hope is to end the franchise with a solid third film based on the books. Hopefully they will decide to get a team together that can film both drama and action for the last go around.",4,A great series built on books,1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,1646,"['Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'very', 'good', 'sequel', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'first', 'movie', 'film', 'moves', 'briskly', 'series', 'action', 'scenes', 'What', 'two', 'movies', 'strength', 'lead', 'character', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'played', 'well', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Jason', 'interesting', 'character', 'so', 'many', 'action', 'characters', 'strut', 'screen', 'arrogance', 'mindless', 'run', 'crazy', 'situations', 'saying', 'corny', 'one', 'liners', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'lead', 'character', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'calmly', 'think', 'plan', 'way', 'situation', 'never', 'arrogant', 'never', 'grand', 'stands', 'character', 'more', 'real', 'circumstances', 'movie', 'more', 'credibility', 'normal', 'run', 'mill', 'action', 'movie.The', 'reason', 'why', 'sequel', 'perhaps', 'third', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'basis', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'pre-existing', 'book', 'series', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'revived', 'build', 'film', 'franchise', 'bunch', 'hack', 'screenwriters', 'just', 'trying', 'make', 'money', 'story', 'character', 'have', 'strong', 'background', 'already', 'built', 'Which', 'was', 'particularly', 'important', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'hard', 'watch', 'camera', 'moves', 'cuts', 'so', 'much', 'nauseating', 'watch', 'even', 'can', 'stomach', 'movement', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'earth', 'happening', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'only', 'action', 'film', 'can', 'think', 'where', 'film', 'excelled', 'action', 'scenes.My', 'hope', 'end', 'franchise', 'solid', 'third', 'film', 'based', 'books', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'decide', 'get', 'team', 'together', 'can', 'film', 'drama', 'action', 'last', 'go', 'around']",N/A
853079,APZC5PRJVM0PY,B0002ZDVEU,JD,"[5, 6]","Like the majority of reviewers I have seen the first Bourne Identity and I loved the movie.  The protaganist, Jason Bourne, is played by Matt Damon, who's previous performances have run the gambit from bad to good, but has been steadily better than most actors.The story, adapted from the Robert Ludlam novels in a take this-leave that nature, is much better than most adaptations if not completely accurate.  I think the first movie is better than the first book in most places, and is certainly smoother.  The second movie however, does deviate entirely from the book, with the only real connection being the manipulation of Bourne via Marie.  Although this doesn't give the second book much credit, I did find the storyline in the movie easier to get into than the storyline in the book of the same name.  The book's storyline would not fair well in today's climate, and I feel a lot of it would be lost on viewers.As the storyline from the book is missing, so is the Bourne charachter.  The novel Bourne relies on his smarts as much as his skills, but movie Bourne falls back on his skills more often than not as he stumbles from one situation to the next with little thought, planning or strategy.  As many reviewers have pointed out, he never tries to conceal who he is, which he did heavily in the books.  He also never waits for a perfect situation to present itself, instead he plunges into things head first again relying on his amazing skills to save his life - not like the novel Bourne at all.  He doesn't try and recruit allies or study his advesaries, another side of Bourne dropped for the movies.  While all of this cuts heavily into the Ludlam character, it doesn't ruin Bourne, it merely supplants him with someone else, a little more cinema Bond than true-to-life covert agent, that actually fits the action movie mold better.  However, I couldn't help but miss the conflicted and brooding Bourne from the first film.  To his credit, Matt Damon still plays the roll very well.Now, onto the real bad stuff that I have pushed to the end of my diatribe.  After previously stating that the first film was smoother than the book of same name (Bourne Identity), this is sadly not the case with the second film.  If you can concentrate on the flow of the movie, the script, the setup and the acting, the Bourne Supremacy is great (not stupendous), but great.  However, the horrible camera work makes that impossible.  I am not arguing against the insertion of the shaky camera technique, as it worked so well in films such as Saving Private Ryan, but in the excessiveness of its insertion, and the excessiveness of the shaking.  Too much shaky cam, and way, way too much shaking of the shaky cam.  Instead of sticking with the formula of using the up close and personal hand-held camera angle strictly in an acton sense, the Director uses it exclusively throughout the film as if he couldn't tell when to start and when to stop.  I was one of those whose excitement at seeing the movie faded in the opening scene when the camera zooms onto Matt Damons upper lip and we watch as the upper half of his head bounces on and off the screen - no joke! And all we are doing is standing in a bathroom looking in the mirror, not running, not fighting, not performing anything at all that warrants this type of camera work.  I suffered, and eventually I was able to put the bouncing camera into the back of my mind and concentrate on the film.  However, at the rare occasions they switch to a stable platform you let out an involuntary sigh of relief because for a moment you can get your bearings and the screen stops spinning.  But alas, it is only for a moment and then the screen starts bouncing and spinning out of control again.The issue is only compounded during action sequences when a little jarring is to be expected.  With the Supremacy, the action scenese are a jumbled mess and a large portion of the film simply takes place out of the view of the lens, which is focusing on a shoulder, wall, floor, upper-right corner of the windshield, etc.  Added to that is the darkness that has been heavily layered over this film to the point that you cannot focus on the objects on the screen - when you do suddenly catch a glimpse of something, it is just that, a glimpse! The angle shifts, you are back in shadows and again the camera spins and dips and jumps and flips.  When other reviewers commented on members of the audience becoming sick they were not joking - I myself had to look away periodicly just to adjust, and in the screening of the film someone actually threw up.Without beating the dead horse anymore, this movie is ruined by the camera work.  I understand what the Director (Paul Greengrass) was going for, but he didn't succeed.  In an attempt to put the viewer on the same level as the actor, we forgoe the structure of a ""movie"" and enter a ""video game"" instead - only we don't have the luxury of directing the camera at all.  The scenes lose any cinema value because we (the viewers) simply can't see them.  The action scenes put you right in the action, but while you realize there is a conflict, you can't tell from where the blows are coming or who the assailant is, nor can we see how Bourne is responding to the attack because he is a blur - see my hands, see his head, see the floor, see my hands, hear a smack but your looking at the wall, someone fell can't tell who they are blur look at wall door wall fist noise - you see where I'm going.  Frankly, I won't watch another film Greengrass touches after this one.If I wasn't such a fan of the first one and if I didn't like the story so much, I wouldn't hesitate to give this movie the lowest possible rating because it is simply UNWATCHABLE.  Although this is the type of series that warrants having each installment, this movie will be impossible to watch on your TV - but at least maybe it won't be so overwhelming you need to throw up!",3,Ruined by the camera work,1095379200,"09 17, 2004",2004,5927,"['majority', 'reviewers', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'loved', 'movie', 'protaganist', 'Jason', 'Bourne',

853081,A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ,B0002ZDVEU,"Jeff Edwards ""RadioJeff""","[8, 15]","Is it me, or didn't one of the 3 major TV Networks turn the Bourne Identity into a mini-series with Richard Chamberlain a few years back (okay, maybe a decade or so...)?  I must admit, in order to 'freshen up' the plot by Hollywood standards, they went ahead and committed the cardinal sin of thinking that a movie screenwriter can do better with re-writing a spy masterpiece than the original author.  Putting all that aside, I still enjoyed the movie with Matt Damon as Jason Bourne aka David Webb.Yes, they took some liberty with the storyline -- to the point of almost entirely re-writing it to suit their own purposes.  For the Ludlum purists out there, this is more than an insult, but direct blaspheme.  However, for those who have not read the novel, this was a pretty fun thrill ride of a story.  I am happy to say that everything that made 'The Bourne Identity' a truly thrilling thriller is back in the even more enjoyable 'Bourne Supremacy'.I was VERY skeptical going into this movie because the novel is one of my all-time personal favorites.  But the film-makers wisely decided to make a sequel to the movie rather than the novel in particular.  If you have read it, you will instantly recognize some truly incredible differences: most notably the location for the movie.  It takes place mostly in Honk Kong and China vs. Germany and Russia in the movie.Despite my misgivings with whoever penned the screenplay, I found myself totally absorbed in the life of Jason Bourne.  Fast moving, intelligent and visually stunning, the 'Bourne Supremacy' isn't without a fault or two.  For instance, why on EARTH when Jason knows that he is being hunted, would he use a passport with the name Jason Bourne ON IT??  That would be certain to raise some red flags for the bad guys, right?  And indeed it does.  Again, I am nit-picking but if Bourne is as smart as he is portrayed by Matt Damon, why would he make such a colossal error?  I suppose because it was in the script, right?  Oh well.I must also comment on some of the fight scenes.  For some this may be wonderful, but I found it to be somewhat difficult to follow since the filming was done in such a way that it very nearly seemed as though the camera was literally INSIDE the actual scene.  Disjointed, and jumpy as you can imagine, and for me anyway, quite difficult to follow.  I suppose it even may have been slightly dizzying for some.  Again, some find this to be brilliant filmmaking, I just found it hard to understand.'The Bourne Supremacy' has what I consider to be THE single greatest car chase in cinema history.  Filmed ON location in Moscow, Russia you have to admit that they have come a long way from the days of the Communist Rule when nothing like this would have been even remotely possible.  Absolutely stunning and incredibly done.  Kudos to whoever choreographed this portion of the movie.All in all I enjoyed it very much, but gave 4 stars simply because it was so completely different from the near perfect novel.  Judge for yourself, but if you liked the first, you simply MUST see this one.",4,Great movie -- not-so-great book adaptation...,1090800000,"07 26, 2004",2004,3079,"['did', ""n't"", 'one', '3', 'major', 'TV', 'Networks', 'turn', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'mini-series', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'okay', 'maybe', 'decade', 'so', 'must', 'admit', 'order', ""'freshen"", 'up', 'plot', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'went', 'ahead', 'committed', 'cardinal', 'sin', 'thinking', 'movie', 'screenwriter', 'can', 'do', 'better', 're-writing', 'spy', 'masterpiece', 'original', 'author', 'Putting', 'aside', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'David', 'Webb.Yes', 'took', 'liberty', 'storyline', 'point', 'almost', 'entirely', 're-writing', 'suit', 'own', 'purposes', 'Ludlum', 'there', 'more', 'insult', 'direct', 'blaspheme', 'However', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'was', 'pretty', 'fun', 'thrill', 'ride', 'story', 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'everything', 'made', ""'The"", 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'truly', 'thrilling', 'thriller', 'back', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', ""'Bourne"", ""Supremacy'.I"", 'was', 'VERY', 'skeptical', 'going', 'movie', 'novel', 'one', 'all-time', 'personal', 'favorites', 'film-makers', 'wisely', 'decided', 'make', 'sequel', 'movie', 'rather', 'novel', 'particular', 'have', 'read', 'will', 'instantly', 'recognize', 'truly', 'incredible', 'differences', 'most', 'notably', 'location', 'movie', 'place', 'mostly', 'Honk', 'Kong', 'China', 'vs.', 'Germany', 'Russia', 'movie.Despite', 'misgivings', 'whoever', 'penned', 'screenplay', 'found', 'totally', 'absorbed', 'life', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'Fast', 'moving', 'intelligent', 'visually', 'stunning', ""'Bourne"", 'Supremacy', ""n't"", 'fault', 'two', 'instance', 'why', 'EARTH', 'when', 'Jason', 'being', 'hunted', 'would', 'use', 'passport', 'name', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'ON', 'IT', 'would', 'be', 'certain', 'raise', 'red', 'flags', 'bad', 'guys', 'right', 'indeed', 'Again', 'am', 'nit-picking', 'Bourne', 'as', 'smart', 'portrayed', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'why', 'would', 'make', 'such', 'colossal', 'error', 'suppose', 'was', 'script', 'right', 'Oh', 'well.I', 'must', 'also', 'comment', 'fight', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'wonderful', 'found', 'be', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'follow', 'filming', 'was', 'done', 'such', 'way', 'very', 'nearly', 'seemed', 'camera', 'was', 'literally', 'INSIDE', 'actual', 'scene', 'Disjointed', 'jumpy', 'can', 'imagine', 'anyway', 'quite', 'difficult', 'follow', 'suppose', 'even', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'slightly', 'dizzying', 'Again', 'find', 'be', 'brilliant', 'filmmaking', 'just', 'found', 'hard', 'understand', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'THE', 'single', 'greatest', 'car', 'chase', 'cinema', 'history', 'Filmed', 'ON', 'location', 'Moscow', 'Russia', 'have', 'admit', 'have', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'days', 'Communist', 'Rule', 'when', 'nothing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'remotely', 'possible', 'Absolutely', 'stunning', 'incredibly', 'done', 'Kudos', 'whoever', 'choreographed', 'portion', 'movie.All', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'simply', 'was', 'so', 'completely', 'different', 'near', 'perfect', 'novel', 'Judge', 'liked', 'first', 'simply', 'MUST', 'see', 'one']",N/A

That being said, this movie was a classic CIA thriller.  Matt Damon puts in another stellar performance as the uber-trained assassin, Jason Bourne.Hiding in India with his girlfriend and wanting nothing more than to be left alone, Bourne soon finds himself framed by a rogue element of the CIA in order to destroy files and steal millions.  When Bourne's girlfriend is murdered during a pursuit by a rival assassin, Bourne is motivated toward revenge.  Still suffering from amnesia, Bourne recalls bits and pieces of his first outing as an assassin--the same mission around which the whole plot revolves.  At the end, Bourne visits the daughter of the two people he murdered in Berlin and explains to her what really happened.  Bourne ultimately clears his name and makes those responsible pay.Additionally, the cat and mouse between Bourne and his CIA pursuers adds levity and tension.  Bourne proves his supremecy by always being one step ahead of the CIA.The film was stylishly filmed in a close-up, handheld camera style that puts you in the action.

Plots twists abound as he uncovers the reason someone is suddenly trying to kill him again.  The action is intense, the story moves fast and we always left guessing.There isn't a lot to do as far as intense acting goes, but all actors make the most of what they have.  Brian Cox is always good and he is no different here.  Joan Allen, also reliable in all roles, makes a strong and commanding presence as the woman determined to find out more about Bourne.  Damon is great, always with a look of determination mixed with a bit of confusion.This is a great spy/action thriller with great performances and enough action to leave you exhausted.

853086,A1U243N9I6JJBZ,B0002ZDVEU,Jim Simon,"[3, 5]","As a fan of the first film, The Bourne Identity, I had high hopes for this middle installment of Robert Ludlum's trilogy.  Sadly, director Paul Greengrass and cinematographer Oliver Wood failed to deliver.Much of the film is just plain too dark to see.  Characters are often shot backlit against a window, and for some reason it never occured to Wood that he might have to throw a light on the foreground actor so we can actually see his face.  Instead we get a lot of unrecognizable silhouettes.Greengrass is apparently of that school of directors that has never heard the words ""tripod"" or ""SteadiCam"".  The footage is so dizzying that you would have thought the cameraman was drunk during the entire shooting schedule.  SOME camera movement is fine during intense action sequences, but this film takes it to such extremes that the audience often cannot follow the action at all.  Edits are so tight that the viewer cannot orient himself to the new scene before he is whisked away to yet another which he cannot get a handle on.  As a result, the action sequences, especially the car chase scene through the streets of Moscow, are entirely incomprehensible.My only other complaint is with the previews for this film, which made it out to be a cat and mouse game between Bourne and his former handlers.  I remember one specific scene where Julia Stiles' character says ""He's doing exactly what he said he would do"", referring to Bourne's warning in the first film that he would ""bring this fight to your doorstep so fast"" if they didn't let him be.  Yet that scene never made it into the final cut.  Yes, some of that cat and mouse does occur, but far less that you might expect.  The story is far more involved than we are led to believe, which is not necessaruily a bad thing, except when that story is told in the briefest glimpses by director Greengrass.  This is definitely one movie you'll have to watch about six times just to get the basics.  Sadly, that's not just because of the story's complexity - it's also because of Greengrass's very poor telling.In the end, this film is definitely worth watching, but do so with some Pepto Bismal nearby, 'cause Greengrass' directing will definitely make you sick.  Identity's director Doug Liman, turned Executive Producer for Supremacy, should definitely take back the director's reins for the final Bourne installment.",3,"Great Idea, Poor Execution",1105660800,"01 14, 2005",2005,2372,"['fan', 'first', 'film', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'middle', 'installment', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'trilogy', 'Sadly', 'director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'cinematographer', 'Oliver', 'Wood', 'failed', 'deliver.Much', 'film', 'just', 'plain', 'too', 'dark', 'see', 'Characters', 'are', 'often', 'shot', 'backlit', 'window', 'reason', 'never', 'occured', 'Wood', 'might', 'have', 'throw', 'light', 'foreground', 'actor', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'face', 'Instead', 'get', 'lot', 'unrecognizable', 'silhouettes.Greengrass', 'apparently', 'school', 'directors', 'never', 'heard', 'words', 'tripod', 'SteadiCam', 'footage', 'so', 'dizzying', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'cameraman', 'was', 'drunk', 'entire', 'shooting', 'schedule', 'SOME', 'camera', 'movement', 'fine', 'intense', 'action', 'sequences', 'film', 'such', 'extremes', 'audience', 'often', 'can', 'not', 'follow', 'action', 'Edits', 'are', 'so', 'tight', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'orient', 'new', 'scene', 'whisked', 'away', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'handle', 'result', 'action', 'sequences', 'especially', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'streets', 'Moscow', 'are', 'entirely', 'incomprehensible.My', 'only', 'other', 'complaint', 'previews', 'film', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'Bourne', 'former', 'handlers', 'remember', 'one', 'specific', 'scene', 'where', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'character', 'doing', 'exactly', 'what', 'said', 'would', 'do', 'referring', 'Bourne', 'warning', 'first', 'film', 'would', 'bring', 'fight', 'doorstep', 'so', 'fast', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'be', 'scene', 'never', 'made', 'final', 'cut', 'Yes', 'cat', 'mouse', 'occur', 'far', 'less', 'might', 'expect', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'involved', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'not', 'necessaruily', 'bad', 'thing', 'when', 'story', 'told', 'briefest', 'glimpses', 'director', 'Greengrass', 'definitely', 'one', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'six', 'times', 'just', 'get', 'basics', 'Sadly', 'not', 'just', 'story', 'complexity', 'also', 'Greengrass', 'very', 'poor', 'end', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'do', 'so', 'Pepto', 'Bismal', 'nearby', 'Greengrass', 'directing', 'will', 'definitely', 'make', 'sick', 'Identity', 'director', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'turned', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'Supremacy', 'should', 'definitely', 'take', 'back', 'director', 'reins', 'final', 'Bourne', 'installment']",N/A

The action is great in this second movie, as are the fight scenes, and the score (music) is excellent. The dialog and plot are also excellent. I can really imagine CIA people talking that way. The ""turf battles"" are no doubt realistic. The only thing I dislike in the entire series is the post-Watergate, leftwing politics of it all. I mean, the view of the CIA is that of the left in say, 1977 - i.e., the CIA is the real ""threat to world peace"", not, say, Bin Ladin. Knowing that real U.S. CIA men die in Afghanistan, like Mike Span, a true American hero, this type of post-Watergate worldview just leaves a stale taste in my mouth. I mean, imagine how much cooler and modern this series had been if Bourne were not fighting his own government, but rather, say, Al Quida. We can only guess how excellent that would be, because I doubt Hollywood wants to make that kind of film (""too simplistic"", etc.). They would rather feed us reruns of TV series from the 1970s (""Bewitched"") than create a movie that depicts true American heros.

853091,A7FDSGMP1F8PA,B0002ZDVEU,John M. Thompson,"[1, 2]","What interests me about this movie is that it's a study in consequences for one's actions, which is true of almost every named character in the film.  Bond kills people left, right and center, with something witty in mind a second afterwards.  He never seems to have any issues with the deaths and property damage for which he is responsible, and his bosses apparently just assume it's a cost of doing business.  Everything feels a lot more real, even if it's not necessarily so.  Agents of the federal government don't always get along and sometimes carry that to a level that hinders their common goal; the bad guys are in it just for the money; no solution really fixes everything that's been broken.  Even if the Central Intelligence Agency does nothing like this, it's as true to life as melodrama gets.It's not faithful at all to the book of the same name, but as laughable as that book got in places, I doubt the director and screenwriters are crying themselves to sleep knowing how different the film is.  The film lives in a universe it created in the first installment of this series, and it's consistent with that; so, enjoy separately.The extras are very good, particularly the director's commentary.  It's as good as Liman's for the original, with a lot of technical details and anecdotes about how the shots were framed and edited.  The shorts on staging the car chases and choreographing the fight scenes were good to watch as asides on the making of this film, especially the car chase.  They mean for you to appreciate how hard it is to make these things look natural, and it's gee-whiz fun for people who get into the movie enough to want to know how it was done.I don't think it's some tremendous character study or anything, but this movie should suit action-movie fans who like to see a streak of intelligence in their heroes, just like the first.  If you watched the first movie and were impressed with the character details, you will enjoy this movie, particularly with the fleshing-out of Brian Cox's character from the original and the personality clashes between him and Joan Allen.  It's unnecessary to watch Bourne Identity first to appreciate this movie, but it's rewarding to see the continuity between them.",5,"Different than the book, different than the first movie",1103414400,"12 19, 2004",2004,2238,"['What', 'interests', 'movie', 'study', 'consequences', 'one', 'actions', 'true', 'almost', 'named', 'character', 'film', 'Bond', 'people', 'left', 'right', 'center', 'something', 'witty', 'mind', 'second', 'afterwards', 'never', 'have', 'issues', 'deaths', 'property', 'damage', 'responsible', 'bosses', 'apparently', 'just', 'assume', 'cost', 'doing', 'business', 'Everything', 'lot', 'more', 'real', 'even', 'not', 'necessarily', 'so', 'Agents', 'federal', 'government', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'get', 'along', 'sometimes', 'carry', 'level', 'common', 'goal', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'just', 'money', 'solution', 'really', 'fixes', 'everything', 'been', 'broken', 'Even', 'Central', 'Intelligence', 'Agency', 'nothing', 'as', 'true', 'life', 'melodrama', 'gets.It', 'not', 'faithful', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'as', 'laughable', 'book', 'got', 'places', 'doubt', 'director', 'screenwriters', 'are', 'crying', 'sleep', 'knowing', 'how', 'different', 'film', 'film', 'universe', 'created', 'first', 'installment', 'series', 'consistent', 'so', 'enjoy', 'separately.The', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'particularly', 'director', 'commentary', 'as', 'good', 'Liman', 'original', 'lot', 'technical', 'details', 'anecdotes', 'how', 'shots', 'were', 'framed', 'edited', 'shorts', 'staging', 'car', 'chases', 'choreographing', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'good', 'watch', 'asides', 'making', 'film', 'especially', 'car', 'chase', 'mean', 'appreciate', 'how', 'hard', 'make', 'things', 'look', 'natural', 'gee-whiz', 'fun', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'movie', 'enough', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'was', 'done.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'tremendous', 'character', 'study', 'anything', 'movie', 'should', 'suit', 'action-movie', 'fans', 'who', 'like', 'see', 'streak', 'intelligence', 'heroes', 'just', 'first', 'watched', 'first', 'movie', 'were', 'impressed', 'character', 'details', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'particularly', 'fleshing-out', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'character', 'original', 'personality', 'clashes', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'unnecessary', 'watch', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'first', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'rewarding', 'see', 'continuity']",N/A

853094,A75MSQQ3LN86Z,B0002ZDVEU,Josef Bush,"[0, 0]","It would seem that the reason this sequel was made as it was is that the inner spring of the Agency's deceit was not revealed in the initial release.  And so, rather than pile on the fight sequences, the producer/director decided to (yes, pile on the fight sequences, but) dive into the villany of Bourne's predicament.  And its simply this: the USA for some reason, wanted to wire either 3 million or 3 billion dollars in aid to Russia, and it was stolen en transit.  The theft was engineered by a corrupt member of Russian Intelligence, working with two corrupt CIA officials.  The three split the money and faked the theft by cloaking it in a CIA assassionation by a new operator, Bourne.  His fingerprints were stolen to be used later as false proof of his involvement, and his memory and/or identity snapped or malfunctioned.  We can't be sure how, but it appears to have been a reaction to his home agency's guilt in not only the murder of the Russian businessman and his wife, but in its willingness to sacrifice personnel so that the CIA thieves could keep not only their stolen wealth, but their positions and perks in the Agency.Not an easy skein to unwind at any speed, but seemingly impossible at the speed required to match Bourne's life as an international fugitive.True, one of the two corrupt CIA officials was killed at the end of the original story, but as we learn, the survivor, in order to protect himself from the hidden but questionable file involving himself, has to use his contacts with the KGB to eliminate Bourne.  That Avening Angel with Carl Urban's raptor face, like the hero in Prokoffiev's opera of that name, seeks out Bourne and his lover in Beach resort Goa, and kills her with a sniper's long range rifle, believing he's killed him.  Then he's off to Russia never to be seen again, presumably.She is shot behind the wheel of a 4X4 as it crashes through a guard rail and plunges into the water below, and the underwater sequence in which Bourne tried both to save the dead and/or dying woman and then to reposition her in the vehicle inspired, it seems to me, Daniel Craig's very similar attempt in CASINO ROYALE to save drowning Eva Green who's trapped in a metal elevator cage that is sinking into a Venedian canal.  The intensity; the despair of love and sensuality irretrevably lost.  Its all there.  And then the movie gears up into Bourne's Revenge Mode.  And it doesn't slow down.  Bourne becomes, his humanity nearaly burnt away, like the edge of ALLAH's sword, Justice, which no man can evade, fortell or delay.At Headquarters we see faces we remember from the initial show, and replacing the corrupt Management Operative who was taken out, we find Joan Allen as Langley's on-the-spot Inquirer, re-opening the Bourne file and searching through whatever evidence remains to find out not just who, but why.  Good performance.  But how unexpected: to play the character as the femenine side of Ann Coulter!Well, there are chase sequences throughout Europe -- all thrilling and ingeneous -- and finally, in Moscow, Bourne -- piloting an old RussoFiat Taxi like a maniac -- manages to get his lover's killer, and we get a keen sort of sensual fulfillment looking at dead Urban's face, the top of his bloody head blown away.Personally, I find this feature to be extremely rewarding and entertaining, but I think the best way to watch it is not as a sequal to the first film, but as the second part or reel of that story.

The previews looked promising and I was pretty psyched up.  It ended up being somewhat of a disappointment - it definitely wasn't a sequel that surpassed the original as in the case of Spider-man 2.The basic storyline takes place 2 years after the first film ended.  Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) are living in India.  He's still got much of his amnesia, but he's slowly remembering things he did.  He sees an assassin (Karl Urban) and they make a run for it.  Bourne gets mad that Treadstone has come after him (at least, he believes it's Treadstone) and in turn goes after them.The biggest complaint I have is the annoying camerawork.  For some reason the director felt the need to use hand-held cameras and jiggle them around... A LOT.  Several times during the film I had to look away from the screen and thank goodness I had tylenol with me for the headache!  Used sparingly in some action shots, the jiggling camera might have been good.  This director used it practically the entire film.  Throughout most of the action scenes, you can't even tell what's going on!Most of the acting was good and the storyline was 'ok.'  Most of the plot twists were predictable and there were plenty of old faces from the original film.  Overall, I was very much disappointed in the film.  I think with a better director the film would have exceeded my expectations.. unfortunately I left the movie theater with a huge headache and nausea.  Two stars.

The Bourne Franchise does just that. This espionage thriller is based on the second of Robert Ludlum's trilogy of books. With one more left to go its getting down to the wire. I strongly recommend that you watch the first movie before seeing this one, even if you've already seen it. The plot of this movie is ongoing and in order to have the full benefit it would be wise to refresh yourself with The Bourne Identity. Jason Bourne has started over with young woman he met in the first movie, now in India, but when someone frames him for murder the government is back on his tail. He is now thrown back into the cat and mouse game that he once knew, but knowing this movie, the cat and mouse roles change constantly. New director, Paul Greengrass, brings a new realism to the franchise. Previous director, Doug Liman, had a more formal take to the story. In this movie the camera is constantly moving back and forth to give the audience that gritty realism that fits. The first movie was a lot calmer as well with the plot. This continuation is fast-paced and tense. The car chase in this movie was incredible. I can honestly say it was better than the Matrix Reloaded's highway chase because NO CGI's WERE USED! Movies are trying to create a new reality within the computer world and trying to make audiences believe that its really happening. Why not just take the extra effort and coreograph a real car chase that will have the audience on edge instead of crashing two CGI trucks head on? The climax of the chase in the tunnel was stunning. The movie overall was stunning. You will not find a modern day action thriller like this anywhere else .ACTING: Matt Damon does a superb job in this role. I don't think I've seen frustration acted out as well as he does it. The other high point of this movie is Brian Cox (X2, Troy, The Ring) who plays the menacing Ward Abbott. I really like Cox as an actor because his roles seem so believable. Joan Allen (The Contender, Face/Off) makes a new role in this movie and does a decent job, but I found her performance a little forced. Almost as if she tried just a little too hard to be a top government bigot. Overall though the acting was superbBOTTOM LINE: In a day where computers do everything for us, even entertain us at the movies, The Bourne Supremacy was refreshingly good.

I'm Kind Of A ...","[0, 2]",Why people hate The Bourne Supremacy I have no idea but what I loved about this sequel was they got rid of a very weak piece of the cast right in the beginning. You break your neck to see this because you want to know the rest of the story and who Jason Bourne really is but when you get to the end to find all that out and well that's all you find out.You don't get a plot twist or anything to make your jaw drop; you just get a plain old mediocre answer to a plain question. One example of a film with a plot somewhat related to this but made it into a giant surprise is Kill Bill and I'm saying this as in when everything was getting to the end Uma Thurman found out her daughter was still alive. While The Bourne Supremacy has a little bit of a boring ending it still is a great movie thanks to Matt Damon and a few others pulling off great fight sequences much like the first film but more extreme.They did manage make a much needed and surprising change in the beginning of the film that makes it better in every way.

The CIA is buying confidential Russian information in regards to a mole within the CIA.  Everything goes as planned as the CIA operatives are listening to each word and have a visual of the agent with the money.  Suddenly the light goes off and the mission has disastrous consequences.  When the CIA searches the crime scene for evidence they find a fingerprint that leads them to CIA headquarters and to identify the individual one most have clearance from the highest authority.Thousands of miles away Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has withdrawn from a public life with his girlfriend, Marie (Franka Potente), to the beaches of Goa, India.  Jason struggles with amnesia, but bits and pieces return to him in the form of fragmented nightmares and dreams.  These fragments seem to be clues about his past and what he has done, and he continuously records his dreams in a notebook.  When Jason returns from one of his routine exercise bouts he notices a man that sticks out in the crowd, which initiates a deadly hunt on Bourne.The cinematography in Bourne Supremacy is brilliant as it moves swiftly using unusual camera angles which generates a feeling of stress and panic. Despite this panicky atmosphere Jason Bourne moves with a directness that resembles a champion prize fighter before a fight.  This displays Matt Damon's good performance in the film where he takes care of business as some do when they pick up the mail form the mailbox.  The editing of Bourne Supremacy is excellent as there are many rapid cuts and jumps from different camera angles, similar to a comic book.  Regardless of being similar to a comic book or not, the editing works its magic as it turns up the tension and produces a highly suspenseful atmosphere.

853120,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002ZDVEU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","The pluses outweigh the minuses in ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" which is a good thing because both sides of the scale here are pretty significant. I am not sure if the credit for the pluses goes more to novelist Robert Ludlum for the novel ""The Bourne Supremacy"" or to Tony Gilroy for the screenplay, but I know that the writing is the best part of this summer 2004 thriller. I have not read any of Ludlum's books, but I know Gilroy did the adaptation of ""Dolores Claiborne,"" so it could be either of them. I also know that the parts of the film that take away from ""The Bourne Supremacy"" can be laid at the feet of director Paul Greengrass.The one thing we know about a Jason Bourne film, as opposed to a James Bond film, is that somebody is always out to see him dead. Bond as least has a mission that has people trying to kill him; Bourne is on a hit list just by breathing. Matt Damon plays Bourne with a understatement that marks him apart from the rest of his secret agent brethren, and which also serves to emphasize the strength of the script. Introduced to the character as a badly wounded body floating in the Mediterranean who did not remember who he was, Bourne survived his first film never finding out his real name, just his identity as Jason Bourne, and dropped off the face of the earth to try and live happily ever after with Marie (Franka Potente), his unwilling ally and now only confidante.Of course, they are doomed, and Bourne goes off to get the people who are trying to get him. This becomes somewhat confusing because the people out to get him on one continent are not same people trying to get him on all the other ones. But the important thing is that Bourne goes off to deliver payback and what is great about this character is his economy of effort. Jason Bourne can create a time bomb in thirty seconds using only three things and in his hands a bottle of vodka has a multitude of uses. Every time he gets into a sticky situation you know he is going to doing something smart and he is going to do it quickly. The intelligence of the character and the script is the strongest part of the movie.But at the same time the script is delighting my brain director Paul Greengrass is trying to turn my stomach. Too much of this film is done by a hand-held camera, rarely to any great effect. Then there are the smash cuts and heavy editing of the fight scenes. What is the good of choreographing a one-on-one fight scene if all we get are quick impressions of what is going on. Then Greengrass starts throwing things together, so that we have hand-held shots of moving people cut at warp speed. This gets a bit disorienting at times and can provoke feelings of queasiness. But Bourne's intelligence overcome these visual liabilities.Bourne is also the smartest person in the film, something it take CIA station chief Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) a while to understand, even though Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) and Nicolette (Julia Stiles) both explain this to her repeatedly. The end game of the film actually has a series of levels, so that it is not a simple thing to get everything resolved, and Bourne does have a hand in everything that happens. There is a strong thread of realism going throughout the impossible situations, but that is why the future of the Bourne series is different from the fate of the Bond flicks.

They have also been made into great movies.In the first move, with the opening scene: An unconscious young man is pulled out off the Mediterranean coast by a fishing boat one stormy night. Thinking that the young man is dead, a curious fisherman with a scalpel finds two bullets in his back & a microchip in his hip. The chip reveals a Swiss bank account. But our wet hero isn't dead but realises that he has amnesia. He then rushes to Zurich. In the bank vault, he discovers his name, Jason Bourne (played by Mark Damon). In addition, he finds a baffling pile of different passports, all with his picture, and a large chunk of cash. In the US Embassy, he bumps into Marie (played by Franka Potente), along with the fact that someone wants to kill him. Armed with a bag of money and superb martial arts skills, & with Marie by his side, he scours Paris for clues about his identity and past life...& finds himself in the middle of two assassination plots (one assassin was played by Clive Owen, as 'The Profesosr') masterminded by rouge elements of the CIA.In the second movie, with the opening scene, continuing from the first movie: Jason Bourne is recovering in Goa, India with Marie. He spots a mysterious dark-glassed man with the wrong clothes while jogging. He escapes with Marie but she is shot in the ensuing chase. The next scene shows CIA operatives under deputy director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) conducting a sting operation to fish out a mole in CIA but something goes wrong. Her subsequent investigation leads to the highly-classified Treadstone project, which apparently involves Jason Bourne. She even finds evidence that Bourne is behind what happened to her botched operation. So Bourne sets out to clear his name. The remaining part of the movie shows Bourne outsmarting CIA operatives - & the assassin (played menacingly by Karl Urban as Kirill) - & tracking down the rogue elements in the CIA with shady connections to the Russian mob, who have jointly framed him in the first place.In the two movies, Jason Bourne demonstrates his uncanny ability to observe & pay attention to what's around him - note: notice the exceptions in the details of the environment - which allows him to constantly stay ahead of his predators & at the same time,  stay agile (mentally & physically) to anticipate dangers & get out of precarious situations.For example...remember the scene in the second movie...after he had jogged at the beach, he observed a dark-glassed man whose clothing & behaviour somehow did not match the environment...His ability to stay calm, size up dangerous situations & come up with super-quick, innovative solutions to escape from capture is well demonstrated in both movies.For example...remember the scene in the first movie, where he jumped down several storeys with a dead body as cushion while blasting his gun at his assassins running up the staircase...the scene in the second movie, where he improvised an explosive escape using a magazine stuffed into a burning toaster in a quickly engineered gas-filled room...Wow! that was great!Naturally, I am also fascinated by the many fighting sequences (particularly the one within a tight environment in the second movie), car chases, cat & mouse games, etc. in both movies.Additionally, what I like about both movies is the total absence of super-duper gadgets commonly found in such spy-thriller movies. Jason Bourne used only his sheer human ingenuity & creativity to outsmart his enemies.To end my review, I must add that I have enjoyed watching both movies, experientially as well as educationally.",5,The Power of Observation keeps Bourne ahead of...& anticipate...trouble...,1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,4050,"['strategy', 'consultant', 'whenever', 'go', 'movies', 'watch', 'movies', 'home', 'often', 'take', 'opportunity', 'seek', 'out', 'possibilities', 'using', 'teach', 'life', 'survival', 'participants', 'seminars', 'workshops.The', 'two', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'namely', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'are', 'two', 'great', 'movies', 'are', 'loosely', 'based', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'work', 'included', 'Rheinmann', 'Exchange', 'Osterman', 'Weekend', 'Holcroft', 'Covenant', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'made', 'great', 'movies.In', 'first', 'move', 'opening', 'scene', 'unconscious', 'young', 'man', 'pulled', 'out', 'Mediterranean', 'coast', 'fishing', 'boat', 'one', 'stormy', 'night', 'Thinking', 'young', 'man', 'dead', 'curious', 'fisherman', 'scalpel', 'two', 'bullets', 'back', 'microchip', 'hip', 'chip', 'Swiss', 'bank', 'account', 'wet', 'hero', ""n't"", 'dead', 'amnesia', 'then', 'Zurich', 'bank', 'vault', 'name', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'played', 'Mark', 'Damon', 'addition', 'baffling', 'pile', 'different', 'passports', 'picture', 'large', 'chunk', 'cash', 'US', 'Embassy', 'Marie', 'played', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'fact', 'someone', 'kill', 'Armed', 'bag', 'money', 'superb', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'Marie', 'side', 'Paris', 'clues', 'identity', 'past', 'life', 'middle', 'two', 'assassination', 'plots', 'one', 'assassin', 'was', 'played', 'Clive', 'Owen', ""'The"", 'Profesosr', 'masterminded', 'rouge', 'elements', 'CIA.In', 'second', 'movie', 'opening', 'scene', 'continuing', 'first', 'movie', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'recovering', 'Goa', 'India', 'Marie', 'spots', 'mysterious', 'dark-glassed', 'man', 'wrong', 'clothes', 'jogging', 'Marie', 'shot', 'ensuing', 'chase', 'next', 'scene', 'shows', 'CIA', 'operatives', 'deputy', 'director', 'Pamela', 'Landy', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'conducting', 'sting', 'operation', 'fish', 'out', 'mole', 'CIA', 'something', 'wrong', 'subsequent', 'investigation', 'highly-classified', 'Treadstone', 'project', 'apparently', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'even', 'evidence', 'Bourne', 'what', 'happened', 'botched', 'operation', 'So', 'Bourne', 'sets', 'out', 'clear', 'name', 'remaining', 'part', 'movie', 'Bourne', 'outsmarting', 'CIA', 'assassin', 'played', 'menacingly', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'Kirill', 'tracking', 'down', 'rogue', 'elements', 'CIA', 'shady', 'connections', 'Russian', 'mob', 'who', 'have', 'jointly', 'framed', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'observe', 'pay', 'attention', 'what', 'around', 'note', 'notice', 'exceptions', 'details', 'environment', 'constantly', 'stay', 'ahead', 'predators', 'same', 'time', 'stay', 'mentally', 'physically', 'anticipate', 'dangers', 'get', 'precarious', 'situations.For', 'example', 'remember', 'scene', 'second', 'movie', 'had', 'jogged', 'beach', 'observed', 'dark-glassed', 'man', 'clothing', 'behaviour', 'somehow', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'environment', 'ability', 'stay', 'calm', 'size', 'up', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'come', 'up', 'super-quick', 'innovative', 'solutions', 'escape', 'capture', 'well', 'demonstrated', 'movies.For', 'example', 'remember', 'scene', 'first', 'movie', 'where', 'jumped', 'down', 'several', 'storeys', 'dead', 'body', 'cushion', 'blasting', 'gun', 'assassins', 'running', 'up', 'staircase', 'scene', 'second', 'movie', 'where', 'improvised', 'explosive', 'escape', 'using', 'magazine', 'stuffed', 'burning', 'toaster', 'quickly', 'engineered', 'gas-filled', 'room', 'Wow', 'was', 'great', 'Naturally', 'am', 'also', 'fascinated', 'many', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'particularly', 'one', 'tight', 'environment', 'second', 'movie', 'car', 'chases', 'cat', 'mouse', 'games', 'etc', 'movies.Additionally', 'what', 'like', 'movies', 'total', 'absence', 'super-duper', 'gadgets', 'commonly', 'found', 'such', 'spy-thriller', 'movies', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'used', 'only', 'sheer', 'human', 'ingenuity', 'creativity', 'outsmart', 'enemies.To', 'end', 'review', 'must', 'add', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movies', 'experientially', 'as', 'well', 'educationally']",N/A

The directing sells sizzle rather than steak, and belongs to the school of Fake it til you make it.  What it does is shoot the action scenes in a purposely confusing way, obfuscation, sort of like a football tv director deciding not to show you the runner evading tacklers and crossing yard lines but rather just showing you things too close up, just a blur, and then he crosses the goal line.  The theory is apparently to keep you on your toes trying to find out what the hell is going on, assuming that this technique will impress you.  I'd rather not play that game.

It picks up where 'Bourne Identity' left off. It is very fast pace and has some real surprises for the aficionado of the films brought to the silver screen from the pages of that great writer of action and suspense Robert Ludlum. He is gone now but how his books entertained me while growing of age. I have read most of Robert Ludlum books and really have enjoyed them immensely. So when the &#8216;Bourne Trilogy&#8217; was brought to the screen I definitely wanted to see them, Well with Matt Damon playing the leading role I loved them. For me they were outstanding. If you have read any of Robert Ludlum&#8217;s books or seen any of the movies you will see that usually there is one heroic individual who is being sought for termination. Why? Well usually it is all about a conspiracy theory. Matt Damon in &#8216;Bourne Supremacy&#8217; is a trained assassin. He is also very good at what he does but he is not a robot. He has a conscious and knows what is right and tries to do it but people will not leave him alone. So Academy Award winner Matt Damon, as Jason Bourne must finish it.

I think Jason Bourne is a great badass, played as close to ordinary as Matt Damon could bring a amnesiac assassin.When someone says &quot;This guy doesn't make mistakes&quot; about a character played by Steven Segal you wouldn't be able to hear the rest over the audience's laughter, but Matt Damon has a way of making me believe it. Maybe it is Bourne's plainness or reluctance to take up his former identity's life that makes him so cool to watch in predator mode. I love how he tracked down his enemies and kept them guessing through the whole thing.Sometimes all you need is a good story, but in this case even the tense script, great performances is brought down by the epileptic cameraman who could not hold still.With movies in Southern California costing upwards of 10 bucks I often find myself weighing the plusses and minuses of going to the theater against waiting for the dvd to rent. I have to be seriously interested in a movie to be bothered with the theater these days, and Bourne Supremacy, I thought, would be worth it. The actors are worthy, and so is the story. Now I have to warn people that while it is a tense film and a well told story, it is a horribly filmed movie.People use the term ""shaky cam"" to describe the constant shaking of the film, particularly during action scenes. Listen to them. They aren't exaggerating. Certain movies are hard to sit through, but not physically. This movie hurt my eyes, plain and simple. I could not follow the action at all. Why have lengthy car chases no one can understand? The cameraman should have checked himself, or the director should have checked him, or the producer should have checked the director. How could they not know that a style like that on a gigantic screen in a dark room would wear on people's eyes? NYPD Blue is a TV show! Shake the camera all day on a small screen, but what is wrong with the director of this movie? How could he think this would've worked?? I'll tell ya, somebody's to blame for wasting such a good story with such good characters by making the film physically difficult to watch.However I will say that this movie might be a better experience on a smaller screen, but don't bank on it. If you're going to spend $10 see something else. I hear the Manchurian Candidate actually manages to hold the camera still AND tell a good story. Wait for dvd, then rent this. Don't buy cause you may find yourself closing your aching eyes and listening to it instead.The Bourne Supremacy is a movie with a good story and a good cast shaken into a nauseating mess by poor directing, and there is no blame on Matt Damon or any of his supporting cast.

It's a sequel to 2002's ""The Bourne Identity"". In many ways it surpasses the original.The movie, which has a sweeping panorama of international locales, opens in India, where Jason Bourne [Matt Damon] is living with his lover, Marie [Franka Potente]. He still has amnesia, but is often awakened by nightmares about his past as a CIA agent. Meanwhile, a CIA agent is killed in Berlin. One clue is left behind by the killer - a finger print belonging to Bourne. How can this be? Bourne was 4000 miles away. Soon, Bourne is caught up in a conspiracy full of deception and dead bodies.Damon is again perfect as Bourne. His performance is central to the success of the movie.

853140,A1W6FFD9OYH5RZ,B0002ZDVEU,"Matt Russell ""superk23""","[0, 0]","The Bourne Identity introduced us to the man named Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). The audience and the character had to figure out who he was at the same time. Although pieces came together, he was still unaware of many things about his past due to a case of amnesia. In the Bourne Supremacy, we catch up with Bourne, now living in India.The movie starts with Bourne having a dream sequence of a murder, Berlin, and terrible flashbacks. We learn that he is still companions with his female companion Marie and that they are still trying to figure out his past. Very soon, we see a setup take place in order to put Bourne at the top of the C.I.A.'s &quot;Most Wanted&quot; list. Also, there is a new hitman trying to kill Bourne. After a failed attempt on his life, Bourne tries to find out who is after him, thinking it is the people behind Treadmont.This takes us on a wild goose chase, but a clever one at that. Bourne dodges the people that are after him, whether it is by train, tram, car, boat, or on foot. The only person Bourne recognizes is Nikki (Julia Stiles). So, at an instance he kidnaps her to find out more about the whole Berlin situation. She says he never had an assignement in Berlin, but he knows that he has. It is at this point that Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) begins to suspect that Bourne is not the guilty one.From this point, Bourne figures out his instance in Berlin, frames the guilty party, and gets away in a fast speed car chase that is fun to watch. Not to spoil key points of the movie, I will just leave it at that. It would not be fun to see the movie and know every little detail when dealing with this kind of film.The Bourne Supremacy is one of those sequels that works. There are all kinds of little things about the movie that reminds you of the first movie, even though I liked it more because we are trying to figure out the person, rather than a story. Anyways, the Bourne Supremacy is a very good follow up. A very good thrill ride for the middle of the summer blockbuster season. It's a darker journey into the series, but it works at all levels.

He's back in full force with the sequel, part two of three, a movie that not only improves on the original but really sets the bar high for the third and final film. In the able hands of director Paul Greengrass, the movie whips and whirs along with the thrill of great storytelling, great action sequences, and really great acting. Case in point: Joan Allen. I loved her in The Contender, thought she was one of the best things about The Notebook, but she enters the realm of 'Oscar Contender' here for her fierce, engaging portrayal of Pamela Landy, easily one of the strongest female supporting roles to come along in a while. But let's not forget Matt Damon, either; he brings a complexity to a role that could have been a cardboard cut-out instead.And I don't know if it's just me, but the action scenes in Supremacy tower above the first film, as well. Greengrass has wisely chosen to shoot the movie with many, many setups on action scenes, and handheld cameras throughout. Just about every violent moment in the movie ranges from engrossing to flat out pants-pissing exciting, and only in a huge car chase at the end of the film does it cross that ever-so-thin line of plausibility. Is The Bourne Supremacy a masterpiece of spy-thriller moviemaking? Nah, not really. But these kinds of movies are a dime a dozen lately, and when one as technically assured and extremely well-acted as Bourne hits screens, it's obvious that it's worth every penny of those 7 bucks.

So many have fallen by the wayside, and sequels don't hold much credibility these days, with CGI and gimmicky concepts, especially when Hollywood is churning them when they're not even necessary.But Bourne Identity needed a sequel, to carry on the story of Jason Bourne, to see if he recovers anymore of his memory. Two years after the first finished, Jason & Marie are in India, living off the grid, enjoying life and each other. Until something tragic happens, and Jason is once more on the run, running from himself, and discovering on the way, that he's been framed for two murders. He's still having recurring nightmares, and is still trying to piece together his former life.The action scenes are absolutely stunning, an amazing follow up to Identity, with an even better car chase than the original, in a taxi, which soon gets wrecked. Bourne even surpasses himself, when in Identity, he fought an enemy with a pen, he now fights an enemy with a rolled up newspaper!I'm still disappointed at Julia Stiles' screen time in this, a gripe which has carried on from Identity. While she has marginally more screen time than the first, it's still not enough for a great actress as she is, trying to spreak her wings past her teenage film roles. Brian Cox has a little bit more revealed about his character, and all is not what it seems with him!Supremacy is an excellent follow up to an already excellent original movie, and I look forward to seeing exactly what happens to Bourne in Ultimatium.

Matt Damon is excellent and convincing as the cool Jason Bourne, trained by a covert government agency as the ultimate assassin.Jason has retired with his girlfriend from the first movie and is leading a quiet life in India.  All of a sudden there is a bombing to cover up some covert crime and the bombers have placed Jason Bourne's fingerprint at the scene.  To make the frame-up complete with no witnesses, an assassin is dispatched to take care of Bourne in India.  Of course the assassin fails but kills Bourne's girlfriend in the chase that ensues.  Thus Bourne again (as in the first movie) forced to deal with people who are trying to kill him, that he has no memory of.Meanwhile a European CIA operative (played brilliantly by Joan Allen) starts investigating Jason Bourne's classified records and starts to ask questions about Treadstone, which brings the remaining characters from the first movie into the fray.  The CIA head that tried to bury the Treadstone project keeps warning Allen that you don't know what you're getting yourself into.Little by little Bourne starts to find out some things about those who are after him until he can turn the tables against them.

Twists and excellent action scenes take this one to the max.

Joan Allen (The Contender, The Crucible), Brian Cox (Troy, Adaptation), Marton Cskostas (Triple X), Julia Stiles (Down To You, Save The Last Dance) and Karl Urban (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, Ghost Ship) are among the great cast. Urban plays the evil assassin who killed Damon's woman. Favorite scene would be the last action scene with Damon and Urban in the cool car chase scene.

853153,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0002ZDVEU,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","Where last we left Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), he was living in a secluded location with his new girlfriend.  The Bourne Supremacy picks up where the Bourne Identity left off: Jason Bourne is a professional killer, a member of the Treadstone Group, who no longer remembers his identity. It turns out that Bourne is a perfect scapegoat for another murder, and it's not long before an assassination is pinned on him.And that's the awkward thing about this installment in the Bourne series.  Bourne's reason for involvement in the plot is basically summed up as ""it seemed like a good idea at the time.""  Fortunately, Bourne slowly unearths information about his own past amidst the machinations of FBI, European assassins, and the Treadstone Group. Unfortunately, professional ""bad guy"" character actors play the bad guys.  I guessed the twist upon his appearance.  Hint: look for the slimy political type who has no reason to go along on the mission but gets told to do so anyway.There are other problems: one of my pet peeves, the blurry memory cam. Bourne's done some very bad things in his past missions, the missions he supposedly can't remember, and the director decided to tell us by having Bourne remember through echoing, blurry shots.  They get old, fast.The trademark gritty fighting scenes are all here, including insane car chases (more like a series of car crashes), the clever turnabouts that you never see in other spy movies, and plenty of fisticuffs.  Bourne Supremacy doesn't do everything right, but it has street-level action down perfectly.By the end of the film we learn Bourne's full name.  But that's a cop out: the Supremacy is more about Bourne proving that in the past he was never a very nice guy.  That's hardly news.Bourne Supremacy feels more like an episode in a series than a movie.  Bourne fans won't be disappointed, but the rest of us will have to wait until the third installment comes out on DVD to see Bourne develop beyond an amnesiac killing machine.",3,Bourne to Be Mild,1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,1989,"['Where', 'last', 'left', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'was', 'living', 'secluded', 'location', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'up', 'where', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'left', 'off', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'professional', 'killer', 'member', 'Treadstone', 'Group', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'remembers', 'identity', 'out', 'Bourne', 'perfect', 'scapegoat', 'murder', 'not', 'long', 'assassination', 'pinned', 'him.And', 'awkward', 'thing', 'installment', 'Bourne', 'series', 'Bourne', 'reason', 'involvement', 'plot', 'basically', 'summed', 'up', 'seemed', 'good', 'idea', 'time', 'Fortunately', 'Bourne', 'slowly', 'unearths', 'information', 'own', 'past', 'machinations', 'FBI', 'European', 'Treadstone', 'Group', 'Unfortunately', 'professional', 'bad', 'guy', 'character', 'actors', 'play', 'bad', 'guys', 'guessed', 'twist', 'appearance', 'Hint', 'look', 'slimy', 'political', 'type', 'who', 'reason', 'go', 'along', 'mission', 'told', 'do', 'so', 'anyway.There', 'are', 'other', 'problems', 'one', 'pet', 'peeves', 'blurry', 'memory', 'cam', 'Bourne', 'done', 'very', 'bad', 'things', 'past', 'missions', 'missions', 'supposedly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'director', 'decided', 'tell', 'having', 'Bourne', 'remember', 'echoing', 'blurry', 'shots', 'get', 'old', 'fast.The', 'trademark', 'gritty', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'are', 'here', 'including', 'insane', 'car', 'chases', 'more', 'series', 'car', 'crashes', 'clever', 'never', 'see', 'other', 'spy', 'movies', 'plenty', 'fisticuffs', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', ""n't"", 'do', 'everything', 'right', 'street-level', 'action', 'perfectly.By', 'end', 'film', 'learn', 'Bourne', 'full', 'name', 'cop', 'Supremacy', 'more', 'Bourne', 'proving', 'past', 'was', 'never', 'very', 'nice', 'guy', 'hardly', 'news.Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'more', 'episode', 'series', 'movie', 'Bourne', 'fans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'rest', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'third', 'installment', 'out', 'DVD', 'see', 'Bourne', 'develop', 'amnesiac', 'killing', 'machine']",N/A

853155,A3CTMZUJ423ETM,B0002ZDVEU,"Michael Simpson ""ttlms""","[0, 0]","When last we saw Jason Bourne in ""The Bourne Identity"", he'd forgotten who he was, then remembered, maybe, just in time to eliminate as many clues to his continued existence as he could before leaving Paris for a secret life somewhere else (actually, a remote Greek island) with his new love, Maria.  The Bourne Supremacy starts a couple of years later and, like TBI, begins in the middle, with Bourne trying to remember what happened in the beginning before escaping at the end.The initial setting for the action this time is Berlin.  Whatever US covert agency is at work appears to be setting up some sort of scam to catch a thief of money, secrets, or both; unfortunately the scam goes bad and the target gets the money and the secrets, leaving only some dead bodies and some clumsy evidence that Jason Bourne is to blame.  This time, another wonk is in the mix -- or a wonkette, Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), freshening the machismo with a blast of blonde estrogen.  We then catch up with Jason and Maria in Goa, India, where they live in relative safety while Jason starts to unravel a whole new set of recurring nightmares set in Berlin and narrated by Conklin's ghost.  Unfortunately, the bad guys have already tracked JB to Goa and head there to rub him out, making it look like he was responsible for the Berlin disaster if no one knows he was still alive first.  Jason survives but becomes more resolute to determine why the government is still after him.  Landy's built with more integrity than Conklin was, and she suspects the case against Bourne is too pat, learning more about his past in the process (since she wasn't in the first movie).  The question then becomes who finds out first what happened in Berlin, and why Bourne was implicated.To say that TBS is my least favorite of the Bourne trilogy is not to say it isn't a very good film.  My biggest beef would be the absence of other ""assets"" for Bourne to take on, but that's the way the story turned -- Bourne has a fine antagonist in an amoral Russian mercenary (Karll Urban).  The foreign settings are fun, and the producers came up with excellent set pieces in Goa and Berlin.  But the most memorable part will always be the car chase in Moscow, where things come to a head.  Greenglass's direction of this chase puts it in the cream of the crop; it stands up and demands comparison to movies as different as ""Bullitt"". ""The French Connection"", and ""Ronin"", not to mention TBI's chase in Paris.  On top of that, Bourne's tutelage by Macguyver pays off as he improvises foot escapes in both Berlin and Russia.  Finally, the movie delivers the trilogy's best ""Depends"" moment.One of the most famous, or infamous, aspects of this film and TBU is the hand-held camera work of Greenglass.  In a theater, this movie is most effectively viewed closer to the center of the screen.  That's less important in TBS than TBU, in my opinion.  For home viewing, even on what passes for a small screen nowadays (mine is 32 inches) the camera work doesn't interfere with the movie.The Bourne Supremacy delivers on its promise to keep Bourne in action through some tight stories and tighter curves.  If it's not the greatest movie in the series, that's just because it's stuck between two great bookends.",4,Marking time,1210204800,"05 8, 2008",2008,3258,"['When', 'last', 'saw', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'Bourne', 'Identity', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'who', 'was', 'then', 'remembered', 'maybe', 'just', 'time', 'eliminate', 'many', 'clues', 'continued', 'existence', 'could', 'leaving', 'Paris', 'secret', 'life', 'somewhere', 'else', 'actually', 'remote', 'Greek', 'island', 'new', 'love', 'Maria', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'TBI', 'middle', 'Bourne', 'trying', 'remember', 'what', 'happened', 'beginning', 'escaping', 'end.The', 'initial', 'setting', 'action', 'time', 'Berlin', 'US', 'covert', 'agency', 'work', 'be', 'setting', 'up', 'sort', 'scam', 'catch', 'thief', 'money', 'secrets', 'unfortunately', 'scam', 'bad', 'target', 'money', 'secrets', 'leaving', 'only', 'dead', 'bodies', 'clumsy', 'evidence', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'blame', 'time', 'wonk', 'mix', 'wonkette', 'Pamela', 'Landy', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'freshening', 'machismo', 'blast', 'blonde', 'estrogen', 'then', 'catch', 'up', 'Jason', 'Maria', 'Goa', 'India', 'where', 'live', 'relative', 'safety', 'Jason', 'unravel', 'whole', 'new', 'set', 'recurring', 'nightmares', 'set', 'Berlin', 'narrated', 'Conklin', 'ghost', 'Unfortunately', 'bad', 'guys', 'have', 'already', 'tracked', 'JB', 'Goa', 'head', 'there', 'rub', 'out', 'making', 'look', 'was', 'responsible', 'Berlin', 'disaster', 'one', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'first', 'Jason', 'more', 'resolute', 'determine', 'why', 'government', 'still', 'Landy', 'built', 'more', 'integrity', 'Conklin', 'was', 'case', 'Bourne', 'too', 'pat', 'learning', 'more', 'past', 'process', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'movie', 'question', 'then', 'who', 'out', 'first', 'what', 'happened', 'Berlin', 'why', 'Bourne', 'was', 'implicated.To', 'say', 'TBS', 'least', 'favorite', 'Bourne', 'trilogy', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'film', 'biggest', 'beef', 'would', 'be', 'absence', 'other', 'assets', 'Bourne', 'take', 'way', 'story', 'turned', 'Bourne', 'fine', 'antagonist', 'amoral', 'Russian', 'mercenary', 'Karll', 'Urban', 'foreign', 'settings', 'are', 'fun', 'producers', 'came', 'up', 'excellent', 'set', 'pieces', 'Goa', 'Berlin', 'most', 'memorable', 'part', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'car', 'chase', 'Moscow', 'where', 'things', 'come', 'head', 'Greenglass', 'direction', 'chase', 'cream', 'crop', 'up', 'demands', 'comparison', 'movies', 'as', 'different', 'Bullitt', 'French', 'Connection', 'Ronin', 'not', 'mention', 'TBI', 'chase', 'Paris', 'top', 'Bourne', 'tutelage', 'Macguyver', 'off', 'foot', 'escapes', 'Berlin', 'Russia', 'Finally', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'best', 'Depends', 'moment.One', 'most', 'famous', 'infamous', 'aspects', 'film', 'TBU', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'work', 'Greenglass', 'theater', 'movie', 'most', 'effectively', 'viewed', 'closer', 'center', 'screen', 'less', 'important', 'TBS', 'TBU', 'opinion', 'home', 'viewing', 'even', 'what', 'small', 'screen', 'nowadays', 'mine', '32', 'inches', 'camera', 'work', ""n't"", 'interfere', 'movie.The', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'delivers', 'promise', 'keep', 'Bourne', 'action', 'tight', 'stories', 'tighter', 'curves', 'not', 'greatest', 'movie', 'series', 'just', 'stuck', 'two', 'great', 'bookends']",N/A

853157,AW99SBGWEXP0J,B0002ZDVEU,Michael Zuffa,"[5, 6]","It has been two years since we last saw Jason Bourne (Damon), and in that time he has been trying to live a &quot;normal&quot; life with his girlfriend Marie (Potente) in India. But quickly, two things go wrong for him. First, someone has killed a CIA agent and planted clues that point to Bourne as the murderer. Second, an assassin has arrived in India to kill him.While dodging the assassin, he attempts to track down the CIA team that is after him. While the team leader, Pamela Landy (Allen) is new to the situation, Bourne's old boss, Ward Abbott (Cox) is also in the mix. What follows is basically a revenge movie filled with action and intense chase scenes. The final chase is expecially edge-of-your-seat cinema.Almost all the cast and crew are back for the second installment of the Bourne series, and that provides a nice feeling of continuity. Certainly, the third novel in the series will be made into a movie, and hopefully the same continuity will be preserved with that one as well. Matt Damon once again is the surprising action hero, a role that one would not have thought possible of him a few years ago.

But Jason continues to find himself plagued by memories from his past with the same questions in his mind: who exactly is he, what has he done and why are people trying to kill him?  Unfortunately for him, the mystery refuses to be solved in a peaceful way for tragedy strikes and he finds himself going back to Europe.  In his quest to find out more about his identity, he finds himself dodging bullets once again and killing more people in the process.  The stakes are surely higher this time around.Matt Damon gives another convincing performance in this follow up, with great support from Joan Allen, Brian Cox and Julia Stiles.  And the return of some characters from the first movie also provides that continuity, although you won't get lost if you haven't seen it.  With strong mystery, tense atmosphere and a focus on the plot rather than frivolous action, which we see a lot of in most action movies these days, this movie is a worthy sequel to Bourne Identity.  Fast-paced, it delivers what I have expected and makes me look forward to that inevitable part 3.  This is international espionage at its best and the character/story development is well executed making it smarter and sharper than your average spy movie.Some people have expressed dislike for the camera technique used.  Yes, there are some shaky camera work, wobbly and kind of blurred images.

This sequel to ""The Bourne Identity"" has Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) out to clear his name and save his own life after being framed for the murder of two CIA operatives in Berlin. Racing across India, Berlin and Moscow, Bourne does battle with a murderous assassin (Karl Urban, unrecognizable from his turn as the noble warrior Eomer in ""The Lord of the Rings"") and two squabbling CIA division chiefs (Joan Allen, Brian Cox). There are car chases, shootings and stunts galore, and Greengrass doesn't miss a trick in keeping the film moving at breakneck speed. Damon, all traces of his ""Good Will Hunting"" baby fat gone, is a thoroughly believable action hero, and the rest of the cast--particularly Allen and Cox--is quite fine. Like a ride on a particularly slick rollercoaster, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is a fine way to pass the time on a lazy summer day.",4,"A swift, efficient thrill machine.",1092960000,"08 20, 2004",2004,1000,"['Paul', 'Greengrass', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'may', 'be', 'lightweight', 'summer', 'movie', ""'re"", 'watching', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'sequel', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'clear', 'name', 'save', 'own', 'life', 'being', 'framed', 'murder', 'two', 'CIA', 'operatives', 'Berlin', 'Racing', 'India', 'Berlin', 'Moscow', 'Bourne', 'battle', 'murderous', 'assassin', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'unrecognizable', 'turn', 'noble', 'warrior', 'Eomer', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'two', 'squabbling', 'CIA', 'division', 'chiefs', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'are', 'car', 'chases', 'shootings', 'stunts', 'galore', 'Greengrass', ""n't"", 'miss', 'trick', 'keeping', 'film', 'moving', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'Damon', 'traces', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'baby', 'fat', 'gone', 'thoroughly', 'believable', 'action', 'hero', 'rest', 'cast', 'particularly', 'Allen', 'Cox', 'quite', 'fine', 'ride', 'particularly', 'slick', 'rollercoaster', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'fine', 'way', 'pass', 'time', 'lazy', 'summer', 'day']",N/A

853163,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0002ZDVEU,mirasreviews,"[3, 4]","""The Bourne Supremacy"" is the second film based on Robert Ludlum's espionage thrillers about amnesiac CIA assassin Jason Bourne. But unlike its predecessor, ""The Bourne Identity"", ""Supremacy"" isn't based on Ludlum's novel that bears its name. At best ""The Bourne Supremacy"" was vaguely inspired by the novel. It is essentially an original screenplay by Tony Gilroy. This film finds Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) two years after ""The Bourne Supremacy"" but with no more understanding of his past than when we left him. Still plagued by debilitating headaches, still unable to remember who he was or what he did, and still accompanied by his paramour Marie (Franka Potente), Bourne is living a quiet life ""off the grid"" in India. Unfortunately for him, someone leaves Bourne's fingerprint behind with 2 murdered CIA agents in Berlin, and an assassin has tracked him to India. CIA agent Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) is intent on bringing Bourne in, believing that he has information crucial to her investigation of stolen CIA money.""The Bourne Supremacy"" is a character-driven action film that will find wide appeal. The film has plenty of action -fight sequences, car chases, great stunts- but they're driven by Jason Bourne's desperation, not by a need for spectacle. Bourne is a post-modern, post-Cold War hero: the victim of a corrupt system, forced into action. He's a ruthless but reluctant killer with whom the audience sympathizes, if not actually pities. Director Paul Greengrass chose to film ""The Bourne Supremacy"" in a gritty, photo-realistic style that keeps the audience in the center of the action and close to Bourne's point of view. On the face of it, this sounds like a good idea. Greengrass took it too far, though, sometimes allowing style to stand in the way of story. Too much of the cinematography is murky, and too much of it is handheld. The camera is dynamic, constantly moving. That's fine, but there is way too much shake. It's annoying and could be pretty unpleasant for those audience members prone to motion sickness. The ideas behind Greengrass' shooting style are appropriate to the film's themes, but the near-constant camera shake makes this big budget action film look amateurish.Like ""The Bourne Identity"", ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is elevated by a top-notch cast. Pamela Landy is a one-note character, but Joan Allen assures that she is taken seriously. Veteran Scottish thespian Brian Cox plays senior CIA agent Ward Abbott. Julia Stiles returns in her small role as a CIA agent and former logistics officer. Matt Damon is appealing and sympathetic as Bourne. ""The Bourne Supremacy"" would have benefitted from a steadier camera, but it's still a thoroughly enjoyable action film. It has suspense, action, real characters, and a great cast.The DVD: Bonus features include deleted scenes, 9 mini documentaries, text ""Cast and Filmmakers"" bios, a DVD-ROM (Windows only), and an audio commentary by director Paul Greengrass. Peter Greengrass, producers Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, Matt Damon, and stunt co-ordinator Dan Bradley all contribute numerous interviews to the documentaries. ""Matching Identities: Casting"" (5 minutes) talks about the actors and their roles. In ""Keeping It Real"" (5 minutes), actors and crew discuss Paul Greengrass' approach to filming. In ""Blowing Things Up"" (4 minutes) the stunt co-ordinator and the special effects foreman take us through filming the explosion in the house in Munich. ""On the Move with Jason Bourne"" (5 minutes) is about the film's locations: Berlin, Moscow, and Goa, India. ""Bourne to be Wild: Fight Training"" (4 minutes) discusses the fight sequence between the 2 remaining Treadstone operatives. ""Crash Cam"" (6 minutes) is about shooting the car chase sequence in Moscow. This documentary is worthwhile, as the chase employed some unusual methodology. ""The Go-Mobile Revs Up the Action"" (7 minutes) continues the discussion of filming cars by introducing us to a contraption that allows actors to be filmed at the wheel of a car while moving. ""Anatomy of a Scene"" (4 1/2 minutes) explores the bridge and barge chase scene in Berlin. Composer John Powell talks about the score in ""Scoring the Film with John Powell"" (5 minutes). Director Paul Greengrass leaves technical talk to the documentaries. His audio commentary expounds on characters and story, including some insights into Bourne's character.

853170,AUI702QTNKN1E,B0002ZDVEU,movie lover,"[2, 2]","I looked forward for months to this much anticipated sequel of the Borne Identity coming to theaters this summer.  As the movie began it all began to unravel during the 1st chase scene when our hero, Jason Borne, is found and running again for his life.  The handheld camera, which is supposed to give you the feel of being there, actually detracts greatly from the scenes.On the large scene of a movie theater, the motion and quick editing is to fast for the eye to follow well.  You can't focus long enough to tell what is going on.  The closer you sit to the scene, I would think it even more annoying.  The worst 2 scenes filmed in this manner are the main fight scene between Borne and another trained killer agent and the final climatic chase scene in Moscow.  The extra long chase in Moscow is especially difficult to watch as the quick editing and camera work make it tiring and you long for the scene to end soon.Now that the movie is out on DVD, I rented a widescreen version to watch at home.  On the smaller sized screen the scenes are less noticable and not quite as tiring to watch.I have read other reviews of people who think this type of motion for action scenes is great, but for the vast majority of movie goers it is very tiresome.  I have always loved roller coasters and thought the newer ones with loops and rolls looked like great fun after observing them from the ground.  But after being in one, I began to get vertigo and nausaus and decided it was more fun to watch them than be in one.  That is true for this movie and its action sequences as well.  It would be better to be an observer standing to the side than a participant.A few things missing in the movie.  Was it necessary to kill off Maria?  If Berlin police have a manhunt for him, why wouldn't they alert train stations and other public transportation to be on the lookout for him?  How could he take a train to Moscow from Germany without being stopped or caught along the route?  If all of Moscow is looking for Jason Bourne, why did they quit looking?  Is it to be implied that they quit looking for him when they arrested the Russian oil mogul?  After the dramatic car chase and crash in a tunnel by Borne, he abandons his vehicle and leaves on foot.  No one seems to be after him from this point of the movie.  Doesn't ring true.I would give this movie an ""A-"" for acting, ""B"" for plot and story development, ""A-"" for pacing, ""B+"" for action, and a ""C"" for camera work.  Overall a ""C+"" movie.  It could have been a better film.  The 1st movie with Matt Damon is still the better of the two films.  Hopefully, the producers will take note of movie goers critisizms of this film and do better on the next one.

My only complaint - and given the type of film that it is I have to say it's a major complaint - is the camera angles during the fight scenes. The camera is zoomed way in during the fight scenes for a close up. This would normally not be a big deal if it was in slow motion but it isn't in slow motion. Imagine this, a bunch of close ups happening so fast that you can barely tell what in the world is going on and wouldn't know if it weren't for the story and the fight sounds happening. Everything else in the movie is great. Incidentally, they use the same sort of camera techniques during a car chase and it worked very well.

Anway, back to the movie...The main problem with the movie was that it was empty.  It lacked feeling and heart that made the first one so good.  Mostly, it lacked Franka Potente who was killed off in the first 10 minutes and that really just killed the movie.  That and bringing back Julia Stiles.  (Is she sleeping with the producer or something?  Whose idea was that?)Joan Allen is always enjoyable to watch (and I was digging her long hair.  It's refreshing to see a 40+ woman who can still rock the flowing locks.) and Matt Damon was on par with the first one but because there was no Potente, his acting seemed to be missing the onscreen chemistry that Potente brought to the story just as much as Bourne was missing Marie.  The only times his acting came alive was when he was looking at the one picture he kept of them together.The movie was okay but had they kept Potente, it would have been better.  They could have just had Bourne put her somewhere where she could be safe until the end of the movie where he could reunite with her again.  (she's in all of the books the movie is based on so I don't know why they had to kill her.)  I mean let's all face it.  The best scene from the first movie was that HOTT!! bathroom scene after Bourne cut her hair.

Imagine my glee when I saw ""The Bourne Supremacy"", which takes all the best elements of the first movie to the next level.  This easily ranks among the best action movies I have seen to date.""Identity"" ends with Jason Bourne slipping out of the CIA snare that was laid for him, and dropping off the radar for good -- or so it seems.  ""Supremacy"" opens with Bourne having made a new life for himself in a remote corner of the world, while he continues to wrestle with his incomplete memories.  He is still haunted by nightmares that he can't pinpoint, and still hasn't figured out the details behind the plot to kill him.  He seems to have plenty of time to get it all worked out.All that changes, however, when Bourne's fingerprints appear at the scene of an assassination that he didn't commit, this time of a top CIA field operative.  The CIA doesn't know it's a frame-up, and takes very personally the death of one of their own.  Their response is, of course, to try to take out Bourne for good this time.  The first attempt on Bourne's life results in the death of his lover instead, which prompts Bourne to take the fight directly to the CIA this time.So begins a riveting, non-stop sequence of maneuver and counter-move, thrust and parry, as Bourne and his foes match wits and weapons in a deadly dance that will not end until Bourne is dead.  But Bourne has other plans, none of which include his own death.  He systematically begins his own investigation and retraces the steps of his own past as he strives to unlock the mysteries that continue to haunt him.  All the while, he confounds his pursuers at every turn -- somehow making it look easy, and leaving the viewer frequently breathless with suspense.Just like the first movie, ""Supremacy"" is pulse-pounding, sexy and high-tech from beginning to end.  In fact, the second movie pushes all of these elements to their credible limits.  Unlike your typical action hero flick or James Bond movie, there is not a single shred of this movie that challenges the viewer's credulity or makes you think ""that could never happen in real life.""  In short, this movie has all the best of the action movie genre without the corny lack of realism, coupled with high suspense that never eases up.

He brings that same aesthetic to the Bourne story here and for the most part you have that sense that you are right alongside what is happening. At times, you are too close: things whizz and blur past you so quickly that their impact isn't felt, or in the case where Damon strangles a former colleague, you really can't tell what's going on. None the less, Paul is an inspiring choice to keep the adrenalin flowing.The essential problems with the film are that Damon simply doesn't have the same gravitas this time around. He seems almost like Arnold, and that lack of vulnerability works completely against the suspense. Brian Cox is nearly perfect as the duplicitous former boss, and Allen nearly delivers an Oscar calibre performance as the current head CIA bureau chief tracking Bourne down. This is one of her strongest roles. Julia Stiles returns as eye candy, and one wonders what is the point of her character (I have not read any of the books). Potente just isn't in the movie enough to register this time around and that's a pity. The final thirty minutes of the film seem like an unending car chase and it just never really captivates you.

Of course, there are phenomenal action scenes, filmed in a you-are-there jerkiness, that reach new heights of realism in action film.

This is an action film, or supposed to be an action film with awe inducing stunts and creative storylines. Although the story line wasn't bad, the action sequences were lagging in creativity.One MAJOR criticism about Supremacy is the shaky camera effect, that is less than effective...it's nausiating. During the fight and chase scenes you are sea sick and confused at who's hitting who and who's in which car, it's a mess.The acting is a MAJOR PLUS in this film though. Although Damon's acting was better in the first (he had more at stake in the first) Joan Allen, Julia Stiles and Brian Cox do a fine job in the sequal(Chris Cooper was great in the first one too).Jason Bourne in this film wasn't able to show his inner struggle and confusion that we all enjoyed in the first.

853207,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B0002ZDVEU,Robert Morris,"[2, 3]","Crisply directed by Paul Greengrass and starring Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, this film offers almost constant high-speed action. As in The Bourne Identity, the young protagonist suffers from amnesia. His nightmares, hallucinations, and mini-epiphanies have yet to reveal all that he wants to know about himself and especially his past. He does know, however, that he was once involved as a highly-skilled assassin in a ""black ops"" project (code name Treadstone) sponsored by the C.I.A. As this sequel begins, Bourne and companion Maria Kreutz (Franka Potente) are happily settled in a seaside village in India, presumably out of harm's way. And then....Tony Gilroy's screenplay is based on the second of three novels written by Robert Ludlum which comprise ""The Bourne Trilogy."" The acting by members of the supporting cast (notably Joan Allen and Brian Cox) is consistently first-rate. Credit Oliver Wood and Dominic Watkins with the cinematography and production design which recreate violent, often deadly encounters in various locations through which Bourne flees or pursues his adversaries. He eventually establishes his ""supremacy"" but at a substantial cost as the film ends.

853209,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0002ZDVEU,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","***1/2Matt Damon returns as secret agent Jason Bourne in ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" a first-rate espionage thriller that boasts a fine performance from the always reliable Joan Allen as well.The character made his first screen appearance in the wildly popular ""The Bourne Identity"" in 2002, a film based, as this one is, on a Robert Ludlow novel.  Bourne is one of a handful of agents who have been turned into little more than mindless killing machines through a (now defunct) top secret mind-altering program.  Despite suffering from a case of amnesia that has effective wiped out all memory of that time in his life, Bourne still has to deal with the guilt that comes from knowing all the horrible things he must have done while under the influence of the diabolical programming. As ""The Bourne Supremacy"" opens, we find Jason living in India, trying to maintain a low profile as he attempts to create some kind of a ""normal"" life for himself and his girlfriend.  But, as always happens in these kinds of scenarios, reality intervenes, this time in the form of assassins sent out to kill him.  As if that weren't enough, Bourne is also being hunted by some CIA bosses who mistakenly believe that he has recently killed two of their own agents.  Thus, Bourne finds himself running for his life in a chase that takes him from India to Berlin to Moscow before the movie is over.With the Ludlow novel as his source, Tony Gilroy has written a complex screenplay that respects the audience's intelligence even when what is happening on screen doesn't always rate too high on the plausibility meter.  Amidst all the convoluted plotting, espionage doublespeak and hi-tech hardware that are the standard accoutrements for the genre, Gilroy manages to stay focused on the human drama at the story`s core, as a man struggles to piece together the puzzle of his life.  Allen makes an effective foil as the agent who first suspects Bourne of killing some of her undercover operatives, then comes to believe in his innocence.  Director Paul Greengrass keeps the action percolating along, maintaining a high level of suspense throughout.  He uses a handheld camera to convey the desperation of Bourne's plight and the fragmentation of his mind, often showing us incidents and events from the character's own point of view intercut with subliminal snatches of disconnected memories.  In addition, the lively, hurly burly editing keeps the picture constantly moving forward.  Personally, I could have done with fewer car chase scenes towards the end, since I have always found characters interacting to be more compelling than automobiles interacting, but I suppose that, when it comes to action film audiences, the beast must inevitably be fed.  On the positive side, John Powell has composed a dramatic musical score that really knows how to gin up the tension at crucial moments.As an actor, Damon combines the seemingly paradoxical elements of strength and vulnerability necessary to make his character believable and touching.  In Bourne, he seems to have found his perfect role.",3,impressive espionage thriller,1116806400,"05 23, 2005",2005,3067,"['***1/2Matt', 'Damon', 'returns', 'secret', 'agent', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'first-rate', 'espionage', 'thriller', 'fine', 'performance', 'always', 'reliable', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'well.The', 'character', 'made', 'first', 'screen', 'appearance', 'wildly', 'popular', 'Bourne', 'Identity', '2002', 'film', 'based', 'one', 'Robert', 'Ludlow', 'novel', 'Bourne', 'one', 'handful', 'agents', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'little', 'more', 'mindless', 'killing', 'machines', 'now', 'top', 'secret', 'mind-altering', 'program', 'suffering', 'case', 'amnesia', 'effective', 'wiped', 'out', 'memory', 'time', 'life', 'Bourne', 'still', 'deal', 'guilt', 'knowing', 'horrible', 'things', 'must', 'have', 'done', 'influence', 'diabolical', 'programming', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'find', 'Jason', 'living', 'India', 'trying', 'maintain', 'low', 'profile', 'create', 'kind', 'normal', 'life', 'girlfriend', 'always', 'kinds', 'scenarios', 'reality', 'intervenes', 'time', 'form', 'assassins', 'sent', 'out', 'kill', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Bourne', 'also', 'being', 'hunted', 'CIA', 'bosses', 'who', 'mistakenly', 'believe', 'recently', 'killed', 'two', 'own', 'agents', 'Thus', 'Bourne', 'running', 'life', 'chase', 'India', 'Berlin', 'Moscow', 'movie', 'Ludlow', 'novel', 'source', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'written', 'complex', 'screenplay', 'audience', 'intelligence', 'even', 'when', 'what', 'happening', 'screen', ""n't"", 'always', 'rate', 'too', 'high', 'plausibility', 'meter', 'Amidst', 'convoluted', 'plotting', 'espionage', 'doublespeak', 'hi-tech', 'hardware', 'are', 'standard', 'accoutrements', 'genre', 'Gilroy', 'stay', 'focused', 'human', 'drama', 'story', 's', 'core', 'man', 'piece', 'together', 'puzzle', 'life', 'Allen', 'effective', 'foil', 'agent', 'who', 'first', 'Bourne', 'killing', 'undercover', 'operatives', 'then', 'believe', 'innocence', 'Director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'action', 'percolating', 'along', 'maintaining', 'high', 'level', 'suspense', 'handheld', 'camera', 'convey', 'desperation', 'Bourne', 'plight', 'fragmentation', 'mind', 'often', 'showing', 'incidents', 'events', 'character', 'own', 'point', 'view', 'intercut', 'subliminal', 'snatches', 'disconnected', 'memories', 'addition', 'lively', 'hurly', 'burly', 'editing', 'picture', 'constantly', 'moving', 'forward', 'Personally', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'fewer', 'car', 'chase', 'scenes', 'end', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'characters', 'interacting', 'be', 'more', 'compelling', 'automobiles', 'interacting', 'suppose', 'when', 'action', 'film', 'audiences', 'beast', 'must', 'inevitably', 'be', 'fed', 'positive', 'side', 'John', 'Powell', 'composed', 'dramatic', 'musical', 'score', 'really', 'how', 'gin', 'up', 'tension', 'crucial', 'moments.As', 'actor', 'Damon', 'seemingly', 'paradoxical', 'elements', 'strength', 'vulnerability', 'necessary', 'make', 'character', 'believable', 'touching', 'Bourne', 'have', 'found', 'perfect', 'role']",N/A

Immersed in the spy world without posting blinking signs to the genre - minimum gadgetry - the movie is a brisk, excellent global tour of international politics.In Matt Damon, the series, mined from Robert Ludlum's novels, has a man of everyday, blockheaded features capable of physical extremes; this is not Tom Cruise tossing back his hair, suspended in vanity from a rock. There is moment when Jason Bourne, in mourning, looks pinched and ugly, an excellent capture of sadness. Bourne barely breathes in this movie, and he doesn't speak much more. Waste in not in his vocab, nor the film's.Still haunted by memories of the mission that helped trigger his amnesia in &quot;Identity,&quot; the first film, Bourne has found a ocean hideout in Goa, India with girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente). Across the world, in Berlin, Bourne is being framed for two murders in a CIA sting gone bad. Soon after, a Russian assassin (Karl Urban, excellent if virtually silent) is after Bourne and Marie, who is killed after a car accident on a bridge. Bourne is then onto Naples, Italy, where he must reenter the CIA grid as deputy directors Pamela Lundy (Joan Allen) and Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) wait to descend. Both want Bourne. Lundy prefers him alive; Abbott pushes for death. Bourne seeks his framers and the source of his dreams. It leads to Room 645 in a Berlin hotel.As a young colleague (Julia Stiles, in garish highlights) puts it, Bourne doesn't make mistakes, he makes moves, drawing the crosshairs closer, the better to learn his captors motives. He lands in three major jams, the last pitting him against that Russian assassin, every bit Bourne's equal, in a Moscow tunnel. Staged by director Paul Greengrass, these public chases are feats of speed and editing, daring enough to admire Bourne's considerable spy skills while still this side of believable - Damon sustains a limp after landing hard on a barge. As in the first movie, boxy European four-doors are the vehicles of choice as Bourne evades his captors - slow, yet seeming to endure almost endless structual damage, they are mechanical companions to Bourne. Functional, indestructible.Joan Allen, glaring soft like steel wool, is perfectly cast as CIA ice queen Lundy - by-the-book and clever, but not Jason Bourne clever. But Cox, as Abbott, is hamstrung by the red arrow pointing at his character. Tony Gilroy returns for the screenplay, and it is again literate, hushed and direct, proving that stories absent of joy - gray skies abound, and Moscow simply doesn't play host to happiness - still entertain through the force of their intelligent gambits. Whereas the Jack Ryan series got caught up with the pedestrian manliness of Harrison Ford, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; is content to keep working the angles, the reward being a night of sleep, or a simple, overdue apology.

853216,A1T4IVIH6NUEXF,B0002ZDVEU,sand-da-man,"[0, 1]","Jason Bourne, his memory haunted by only shadowy, fleeting glimpses of his murky past, is now living with his girlfriend in what he thinks is an incognito existence somewhere in India.  This tranquil setting is shattered suddenly when yet another assassin appears one day to kill him.  The tragic events that follow prompt him to come out of hiding to seek revenge and perhaps finally to resolve the enduring questions about his identity.  So begins a new odyssey called the Bourne Supremacy.In took me two viewings to appreciate the full value of the first movie in this series.  I finally discovered that, despite the seemingly incomprehensible secret-agent-speak and the multiple movements of bodies and objects, there was a complex and interesting story just beneath the surface.  Filled with many of the same compelling elements- pathos, action, suspense, intrigue- The Bourne Supremacy is a worthy sequel to the original, but it is also an entertaining thriller in its own right.  A strong screenplay from Tony Gilroy (who also wrote the one for Identity) maintains the quality of the story line, explaining even more of the riddles surrounding Jason Bourne's past and his attempts at redemption.  Shot once again on location in major European cities, further continuity is provided by the appearance of almost all of the original cast members who reprise their roles. The addition of academy award-winning Joan Allen who is effective as Pamela Landy, the ambitious but ethical CIA Supervisor of Operations, only bolsters that line-up.Unfortunately, however, this does not measure up to its predecessor, and what flaws there are can be traced to the man at the helm.  Doug Liman, Director on Bourne Identity, was the real force behind that project.  Indeed, he not only crafted an excellent movie but was also the one who had initially obtained the movie rights to the Robert Ludlam novel by making a personal visit to the author's home and then shopping it painstakingly to the studios.  Although new director Paul Greengrass is faithful to the spirit and winning formula of that film, his approach forces us to be infrequently, but nonetheless noticeably distracted.  While Identity was undeniably an action picture, it was substantially character-driven. Supremacy, on the other hand, tips the balance in the other direction.  Greengrass gives us a little too much gratuitous violence and a few too many scenes that stretch the bounds of believability, including an agonizingly long final car chase. Other problems flow simply from his technique. We are informed that he went to great ends in order to achieve a sense of realism such as eschewing the use of computerized or other ""special"" effects in the stunt scenes.  That he is one of a group of new directors who are once again employing these kinds of methods perhaps signals a welcome return to authentic film making, and I praise him for his effort. Yet, it appears he has taken this principle too far.  For example, his desire to obtain a ""gritty texture"" from many of his camera shots, so common in documentary films, the genre from which he draws his experience, often results in an image which is dull and even worse, not visible.  His extensive use of hand-held cameras in his action sequences likewise can be too much of a good thing. With the repeated, shaking frames during that car chase to which I referred, for instance, we may indeed feel as if we're in a speeding, careening vehicle, but it's at the cost of being able to see what's actually happening.Despite these imperfections, this is still a very enjoyable movie yet not as much as the Bourne Identity.

853218,APEJ4UN2JQNSN,B0002ZDVEU,"Sasa Husaric ""sasa28""","[3, 4]","[...]The film starts 2 years after the events from the previous movie. Bourne and Marie are still hiding from the intelligence agencies and other pursuers and are living quietly in India. Bourne is having bad dreams and nightmares as he remembers some details from his previous life before the amnesia. He particularly remembers something concerning his first real mission but can't remember enough to piece the events together.Meanwhile in Berlin CIA is buying some information but in a professional hit their operative and the seller are murdered. The killer leaves Bournes fingerprints at the scene trying to implicate him in the murder. Then he travels to India with the intention of killing Bourne and covering his tracks. After a high speed chase through a small town in India Marie ends up killed and Bourne is pulled back into his former life again.It is unclear why he decides to return. Is it to avenge his lover or because he is driven to find the truth about himself. Whatever the reason Bourne travels to Europe and intentionally gets  himself detained by the police. CIA sends its local operative to interrogate him but Bourne uses him to get access to the leader of the team that pursues him.The CIA team is led by Pamela Landy a female operative who was responsible for the buyout operation in Berlin. She is determined to stop Bourne and uses all her influence to uncover information about the Treadstone project Bourne was part of. She is forced to cooperate with Ward Abbott, previous leader of the project whose intentions are unclear since he constantly shifts entire blame on his dead colleague Conklin and Bourne.Bourne comes to Berlin, and gains access to the site of his first real mission. He then remembers that it was an assassination of a Russian politician Nesky, who was opposed of the privatization of oil sources in Russia. Nesky was killed so that Russian businessman Gretsky can buy the oil rights with CIA's money which was provided to him by Abbott.Bourne gets Abbott's confession on tape and delivers it to Landy clearing his name. Then he decides to visit Russia in search of the daughter of Nesky since he feels that she must know the truth about her parents death. He manages to elude the entire Moscow police and a killer Kiril who is responsible for Marie's death.He then resurfaces a few weeks later to contact Landy warning her to leave him alone. She then gives him his real name and some basic information about his place of birth. Bourne then, in his style again disappears in the crowd.This is a good movie but it is not as good as The Bourne Identity. There are a few reasons why I feel that way. The Bourne Identity was excellent since there was a great mystery to be solved. The viewer had no idea who Bourne was or why he is on the run. This time the story is much more predictable and so the movie looses some of the appeal. It was quite obvious from the beginning that Bourne was framed and that somebody in CIA was involved. Once Abbott came on screen it was fairly easy to guess that he is league with the Russian businessman.Then there is the way the movie was filmed. Almost all of the scenes were filmed with ""hand held"" camera and it was I presume done so that the story will seem more real and credible. I feel it was overdone making the movie unnecessarily hard to follow and some scenes are almost unwatchable. It was used to great effect in the fight scene between Bourne and a fellow Treadstone member in Germany and that scene looks great. But in the chase scene in Russia it was overdone and actually made the scene less enjoyable. The chase was actually very well done, and was on par with chase scenes in ""Ronin"" which I find the benchmark for this type of action. But shakiness of the scenes was distracting and confusing.The final meeting between Bourne and Netsky girl was supposed to be a very touching, human moment but it came out overly pathetic. Mat Damon as Bourne was very good but Oksana Akinshina as Irena Netsky looked stiff and unconvincing. I would expect more of a reaction when a person is confronted with the killer of his parents.Concerning realism, most of the movie actually looks pretty real. Bournes actions and spy tricks are believable. I particularly like the way he uses his mobile phone in the hotel to find out the number of the room where Pamela Landy is staying. Unfortunately there is one thing I can't swallow. It is Bournes driving with a bleeding shoulder wound. That kind of driving requires a lot of concentration and both hands and feet working in perfect sync. Bourne not only has a wound, but during the chase manages to cure it with an alcoholic drink (Vodka?) and manages to stop the bleeding by applying some socks he stole from the store also. So much for realism.The performance of Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is again very good as good as in the first movie. He plays the spy very convincingly and looks very good in all action scenes. Also in more emotional scenes, like the one when Marie dies, he conveys all the emotions well. The rest of the cast is good also. Karl Urban (Eomer from The Lord of the Rings) looks like a killer but has only a few lines to deliver. Joan Allen as Pamela Landy is very good. He plays the female CIA operative with poise and never looks out of place.Overall I liked the movie but it was not good as the first movie. The ending with Bourne disappearing into the crowd implies there will be more movies with the same character. I hope they will get better  since the Bourne character deserves a good movie.",4,Bourne is back,1100649600,"11 17, 2004",2004,5553,"['[', 'film', '2', 'years', 'events', 'previous', 'movie',

In ""Bourne Identity,"" Jason Bourne was struggling to find out how he ended up in the water accident and in this film he wants to know just who he is. The problem is that the CIA is after him at the same time. They don't believe he really doesn't know as much as he seems to not know. But what both Bourne and the CIA do know is that regardless of whether he remembers the deal he made three years ago, his fighting and killing instincts have not left him. In ""Bourne Identity,"" he was surprised at how much he knew about defending himself and plotting on ways to disappear. The average man just doesn't know how to safely land jumping from building to building and hopping over glass with just a T-shirt from a clothing line to protect him. But Jason Bourne (aka Dave Webb) does, and he wants to know what happened to him to make him this way. The CIA is after him and he's after the CIA. The only problem is he doesn't know the name of the person he wants to see when he reaches that person. Meanwhile two female agents don't like the way the Bourne mission is going. It's gone from legal to criminal, and agents are wondering whether these two ladies are fighting for or against him.Although Jason Bourne should've been dead after all the car accidents and hopping from building to building without so much as an ankle sprain, the movie was still good. Was it realistic? For someone who knows how to fight and kills for a living, certainly he's going to have more strength than your everyday guy.

There is a lot of shooting, one person gets strangled to death, another drowns and many many cars get crashed all over the place. The camera play is so on target, you feel like you are in the car with Bourne as cars go zig-zagging and spinning inbetween other cars. I was literally on the edge of my seat during most of this film.The action is stimulating enough to appeal to the low-brow crowd and intellectually stimulating enough as to not put those with higher brain functions into a coma. My heart was beating like crazy during this film, as I felt like I was more of a participant than a viewer.Bourne's character is something else - he is apparently fluent in German, Hindi & Russian as well as English - and perhaps fluent in other languages as well. He is a good shot, an incredible defensive driver, sensitive, loyal, decent, articulate and just an all-around good guy who has been done wrong by many levels of government. Unlike James Bond, who is supplied by Q with the latest in technological gadgets, Bourne can make-do with anything he finds if he has to, and he doesn't have to go bed-hopping to do it.

But how wrong I was. And its successor, The Bourne Supremacy was even better.Here is the basic story - Jason Bourne is living in India with his girlfriend, having escaped the clutches of the CIA. He's still haunted by nightmares of his previous life, but at least he's safe - or so he thinks! Soon he finds himself framed for a murder he couldn't have committed and has to come out of hiding to prove his innocence. He's back on the run - and with even more at stake!Matt Damon is again excellent as Jason Bourne (or is that his real name???), and Brian Cox is up to his usual fine acting skills in reprising his role as the slippery Ward Abbot. The only thing I was sorry about was the lack of the feisty Franke Potente in the movie - I won't ruin it but she only appears for a bit.Will Bourne clear his name? Can he evade capture? One thing's for sure, he's not happy. Now it's personal. It's not just a quest for justice - he's hell bent on avenging Franke Potente's death as well.

It delivers lots of action and has all the familiar cat and mouse games, not to mention a few familiar faces from the first film. However, more chases and more complexity to the chases do not a better movie make.The biggest problem with this film is the shaking camera, which was overdone and became anoying--I had to look away a few times and sometimes it was hard to see who was doing what to whom.Another problem is that while there were many chases and fights, I did not feel as close to Jason Bourne as I did in the first movie. The story was not as tight this time, and some of the action felt like padding. The resolution of the mystery was not so compelling either.On the plus side, Joan Allen was solid as Agent Lundy, an excellent addition to the Bourne saga. Allen was believable and compelling in her performance. Matt Damon is still the star, and he continues to shine as Bourne. The film also showcases many believable intrigues and has the feel of real life espionage, which I always appreciate in any film of this genre. It is an intelligent action story, and lives up to the original in that respect.Compared to other action movies, this is as good (or better) as so many out there.

Papagiannis ""djqwake""","[3, 4]","I wasn't sure what to expect going into this film, having had seen The Bourne Identity a few years back (and not even knowing until two months ago that it was the first in a trilogy). Overall I have to say I was quite pleased with the film as a whole. The following is a breakdown of all aspects of The Bourne Supremecy.Story: (A-) I think the story and plot development was intriguing... giving u twists, turns, and surprises. However, there were some points which were a bit convoluted and a times confusing, but these were minor. Overall the storyline was very enjoyable to followCasting: (A) A really smart casting move was Karl Urban as a Russian assassin; he was the part. A good use of consistancy by keeping all actors from previous movie onboard...a big plus for any film. Refreshing to see new faces and different dynamics.Cinematography: (B) I will agree with everybody about the shakiness of the camera in pretty much all dynamic shots; static shots were fine. It's understandable that camcorder shakiness is good when used for certain situations, however it seemed a bit much (I was honestly thinking the film was slipping a little or something). Otherwise, everything seemed alright here. Nothing that really stood out as unconventional or original to make this a perfect A.Visual Effects: (A) Not much here except the carchase material and ending credits, which was a really cool effect (and refreshing in that it's nothing like I've ever seen before). Anything which required digital aesthetics held it's own here.Music: (B+) Although composed by John Powell, a very good musician, the soundscape was a tad bit bland like his work on The Bourne Identity. I will say I enjoyed his homage to the &quot;Treadstone Assassins&quot; motif from The Bourne Identity...probably his best and most recognized piece of music for the Bourne trilogy. Moby's &quot;Extreme Ways&quot; was a nice touch, especially in lyrical composition in regard to Jason Bourne.Overall, a quite decent summer flick, and I think it would be worth seeing again to try and unravel some of the minor confusing points.

The big car chase (someone actually described it as &quot;the best car chase ever filmed!&quot; -- Puhleeze!) is even worse. I saw the side of a car, some other car, the wheels of a car, someone's silhouette inside a car (not sure whose), some other car spinning out of control, someone's face (&quot;Who was THAT?&quot;), etc., etc., ad nauseum (literally)!

He is framed for the murder of a CIA agent and someone makes an attempt on his life.  These events set the action in motion and it never slows down after that.The story goes from India across Europe and also has action in Russia.

853237,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,B0002ZDVEU,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[2, 3]","XXXXXThis movie is loosely based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum (1927 to 2001).  The plot also incorporates aspects of the Bourne novel ""The Bourne Legacy"" (2004) written by Eric Van Lustbader (born: 1946).It is a sequel to 2002's ""The Bourne Identity"" (as is 2007's ""The Bourne Ultimatum"").This movie continues the story of Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), an amnesiac and former CIA assassin, and his attempt to learn more of his past.  This time the CIA what's to bring him in.  Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), a CIA Deputy Director and Task Force Chief who is pursuing Bourne says this more forcefully:""We're going to find this son of a b**ch and take him down.  I'm not having Jason Bourne destroy any more of this agency.""Awesome fight scenes and breath-taking car chase scenes are two major highlights of this movie making it a state-of-the-art espionage thriller.  This movie is more dialogue driven compared to the first one making it for me, actually better than the first movie.Matt Damon as Jason Bourne effectively carries the entire movie.  Kudos should also go to Joan Allen as Director Pamela Landy for her intriguing performance.  I found the background music to be quite exhilarating.The various action scenes employ shaky camera work making them sometimes difficult to follow.  Some people may be put off by this but I found that this technique gave the movie a gritty, realistic, and edgy feel.Total box office for this movie was about two hundred and eighty-eight million, surpassing that brought in by ""The Bourne Identity"" (about two hundred and fourteen million).Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2004) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are many extras including an alternate ending.In conclusion, this movie effectively continues the plight of a new action hero named Jason Bourne!!!(2004; 1 hr 40 min (excluding end credits), wide screen;  24 scenes)&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX",5,They should have left him alone,1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,1965,"['XXXXXThis', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', '1986', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', '1927', '2001', 'plot', 'also', 'aspects', 'Bourne', 'novel', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', '2004', 'written', 'Eric', 'Van', 'Lustbader', 'born', '1946', '.It', 'sequel', '2002', 'Bourne', 'Identity', '2007', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', '.This', 'movie', 'story', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'amnesiac', 'former', 'CIA', 'assassin', 'attempt', 'learn', 'more', 'past', 'time', 'CIA', 'what', 'bring', 'Pamela', 'Landy', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'CIA', 'Deputy', 'Director', 'Task', 'Force', 'Chief', 'who', 'pursuing', 'Bourne', 'more', 'forcefully', ""'re"", 'going', 'find', 'son', 'b**ch', 'take', 'down', ""'m"", 'not', 'having', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'more', 'agency', 'Awesome', 'fight', 'scenes', 'breath-taking', 'car', 'chase', 'scenes', 'are', 'two', 'major', 'highlights', 'movie', 'making', 'state-of-the-art', 'espionage', 'thriller', 'movie', 'more', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'compared', 'first', 'one', 'making', 'actually', 'better', 'first', 'movie.Matt', 'Damon', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'effectively', 'entire', 'movie', 'Kudos', 'should', 'also', 'go', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'Director', 'Pamela', 'Landy', 'intriguing', 'performance', 'found', 'background', 'music', 'be', 'quite', 'exhilarating.The', 'various', 'action', 'scenes', 'employ', 'shaky', 'camera', 'work', 'making', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'follow', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'found', 'technique', 'gave', 'movie', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'edgy', 'feel.Total', 'box', 'office', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'two', 'hundred', 'eighty-eight', 'million', 'surpassing', 'brought', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'two', 'hundred', 'fourteen', 'million', '.Finally', 'DVD', 'one', 'released', '2004', 'perfect', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'many', 'extras', 'including', 'alternate', 'ending.In', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'effectively', 'plight', 'new', 'action', 'hero', 'named', 'Jason', 'Bourne', '2004', '1', 'hr', '40', 'min', 'excluding', 'end', 'credits', 'wide', 'screen', '24', 'scenes', 'lt', 'lt', 'Stephen', 'Pletko', 'London', 'Ontario', 'Canada', '>', '>', 'XXXXX']",N/A

Both of which are so well crafted - though by two different directors - that (with the additional of the third) they will make one of the most enduring movie trilogies (or series if we're so lucky as to get a fourth movie) ever created.Matt Damon throughly inhabits the character. The casting is perfect down through the extra's. The director(s) use the locations to great advantage. The cutting moves the action along at a blistering pace, yet in repeat viewings there are plenty of delightful discoveries to make that reflect the care put into the production.My only quibble is the excessive reliance on ""shaky cam"" (combat video) film-technique. Thankfully the effects of which are minimized on the small screen. While I think it adds excitement and energy, the flurry of camera movements distracts from the choreography of the martial arts in the second and third movies. Yes, it's a minor disappointment, but the fight scenes are very well-thought out and as carefully crafted as everything else in the production.On days when my own life seems incoherent, I can always put one of the Bourne movies in the DVD and spend a couple of hours with someone who always knows what he should do next and has the resources to pull it off.",5,"Thoughtful, Well Crafted Thriller",1189641600,"09 13, 2007",2007,1379,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'third', 'Bourne', 'movie', 'three', 'times', 'now', ""'m"", 'very', 'much', 'looking', 'forward', 'video', 'release', 'so', 'can', 'add', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'crafted', 'two', 'different', 'directors', 'additional', 'third', 'will', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'enduring', 'movie', 'trilogies', 'series', ""'re"", 'so', 'lucky', 'get', 'fourth', 'movie', 'ever', 'created.Matt', 'Damon', 'throughly', 'character', 'casting', 'perfect', 'down', 'extra', 'director', 's', 'use', 'locations', 'great', 'advantage', 'cutting', 'moves', 'action', 'along', 'blistering', 'pace', 'yet', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'are', 'plenty', 'delightful', 'discoveries', 'make', 'reflect', 'care', 'put', 'production.My', 'only', 'quibble', 'excessive', 'reliance', 'shaky', 'cam', 'combat', 'video', 'film-technique', 'Thankfully', 'effects', 'are', 'minimized', 'small', 'screen', 'think', 'excitement', 'energy', 'flurry', 'camera', 'movements', 'choreography', 'martial', 'arts', 'second', 'third', 'movies', 'Yes', 'minor', 'disappointment', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'well-thought', 'out', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'everything', 'else', 'production.On', 'days', 'when', 'own', 'life', 'incoherent', 'can', 'always', 'put', 'one', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'DVD', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours', 'someone', 'who', 'always', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'next', 'resources', 'pull', 'off']",N/A

What's in that suitcase? The plot. Some acting. Large dosages of common sense. Oh, and the script. Sadly, the suitcase and its contents never get recovered.While the first Bourne installment was one of those rare cases of action films that actually did have a plausible story, good acting and directing, this one lacks all three. And lacking on all three it even adds up some further faults to undermine the whole affair even more.The curse of the sequels? It hardly matters since as a sequel this film is simply a ghost of its predecessor, and a very unconvincing ghost at that.The director decided to employ this simple trick: seeing that he's got zero plot to work with, he manically over-edited the film creating something that looks like a hyper-extended version of a long video clip. As it is with such video clips, your interest in the film will probably last a brave 10-15 minutes and it will all go downhill from there on.There's no need to go deeper into this. Anyone who's seen it knows it has very little to do with the very succesful ""Bourne Identity"". That in turn is a pity because the first film had all the elements in place to keep the recipe functional in the sequel as well.Why was it all discarded then?

It was either that or ""Bourne to Win"" or even ""The Wizard of Oz-Bourne"" but now that's just being ridiculous.The Bourne Supremacy is a fine action movie directed by Paul Greengrass that is notable for several reasons, chief among them being that the film cements Matt Damon's status as an action hero. The film ties into the Bourne Identity quite nicely and is paced in such a way that the viewer most likely will be out of breath by the end of the climactic car chase. Speaking of the car chase, it's right up there with the best ever and blows the chase from the first film completely out of the water. I'd say this film overall is just great fun with a top notch cast, great action and an even better storyline than it's predecessor.Universal's HD-DVD of the film is interesting to me for several reasons. The camerawork in the movie is shaky-cam of the highest order (I remember after the film came out, a few friends told me that watching it on the big screen made them slightly nauseous, especially during action scenes) and I think that this somehow makes the film appear slightly softer in HD and not quite as sharp as other HD pictures I've seen. In the moments where the film is still, that's when you can see just how crisp and clean the picture actually is. If you watch the fight scene in the house between him and the last remaining agent and then compare that to the scene where he is looking through the scope of a sniper rifle at Joan Allen's character, you'll see exactly what I mean.I'm not knocking the picture and I think it looks great overall, it's just an interesting look. Plus, the film favors a green tint much the way a film like Minority Report favored a kind of washed out blue. I don't know if this'll put anybody off but I didn't mind it too much.The sound is just fine and in scenes like the car chase, you get the surround speakers literally accosting you from all sides with screeching metal, gunfire and general mayhem. Definitely a speaker buster.Scene access is available during movie play as well as the special feature menu and this disc basically has the same list of bonuses as the standard DVD release. Basically you're covered because you get a lot of different features that are all very informative in their own right.I'd definitely recommend this HD-DVD. While it's not the absolute best looking HD title I've seen (and at the time of this writing, there's not many to compare to), it still looks excellent and has more features than you can shake a stick at.",4,A Star is Bourne!,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,2586,"['love', 'bad', 'puns', 'try', 'avoid', 'somehow', 'keep', 'pulling', 'back', 'was', 'Bourne', 'Win', 'even', 'Wizard', 'Oz-Bourne', 'now', 'just', 'being', 'ridiculous.The', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'fine', 'action', 'movie', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'notable', 'several', 'reasons', 'chief', 'being', 'film', 'cements', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'status', 'action', 'hero', 'film', 'ties', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'quite', 'nicely', 'paced', 'such', 'way', 'viewer', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'be', 'breath', 'end', 'climactic', 'car', 'chase', 'Speaking', 'car', 'chase', 'right', 'there', 'best', 'ever', 'chase', 'first', 'film', 'completely', 'water', ""'d"", 'say', 'film', 'overall', 'just', 'great', 'fun', 'top', 'notch', 'cast', 'great', 'action', 'even', 'better', 'storyline', 'predecessor.Universal', 'HD-DVD', 'film', 'interesting', 'several', 'reasons', 'camerawork', 'movie', 'shaky-cam', 'highest', 'order', 'remember', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'friends', 'told', 'watching', 'big', 'screen', 'made', 'slightly', 'nauseous', 'especially', 'action', 'scenes', 'think', 'somehow', 'film', 'appear', 'slightly', 'softer', 'HD', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'sharp', 'other', 'HD', 'pictures', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'moments', 'where', 'film', 'still', 'when', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'crisp', 'clean', 'picture', 'actually', 'watch', 'fight', 'scene', 'house', 'last', 'remaining', 'agent', 'then', 'compare', 'scene', 'where', 'looking', 'scope', 'sniper', 'rifle', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'character', ""'ll"", 'see', 'exactly', 'what', 'mean.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'knocking', 'picture', 'think', 'great', 'overall', 'just', 'interesting', 'look', 'film', 'green', 'tint', 'much', 'way', 'film', 'Minority', 'Report', 'favored', 'kind', 'washed', 'out', 'blue', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ll"", 'put', 'anybody', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'too', 'much.The', 'sound', 'just', 'fine', 'scenes', 'car', 'chase', 'get', 'surround', 'speakers', 'literally', 'accosting', 'sides', 'screeching', 'metal', 'gunfire', 'general', 'mayhem', 'Definitely', 'speaker', 'buster.Scene', 'access', 'available', 'movie', 'play', 'as', 'well', 'special', 'feature', 'menu', 'disc', 'basically', 'same', 'list', 'bonuses', 'standard', 'DVD', 'release', 'Basically', ""'re"", 'covered', 'get', 'lot', 'different', 'features', 'are', 'very', 'informative', 'own', 'right.I', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'HD-DVD', 'not', 'absolute', 'best', 'looking', 'HD', 'title', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time', 'writing', 'not', 'many', 'compare', 'still', 'excellent', 'more', 'features', 'can', 'shake', 'stick']",N/A

Set in the cold streets of Berlin we follow Jason Bourne once again on his quest for revenge.  The story is very compelling, and the film is shot in a way that puts you in the center of all the action that is before you.  Matt Damon is definately outshining his Boston pal Ben Affleck in becoming the next big action star.  Unlike James Bond, you can relate to Jason Bourne because he lacks suave and perfection that Bond does.  He still can fight and talk his way through hostile situations but he does it more human than other action heroes we have seen in the past. Julia Stiles performs in an extremely short role in the film. The supporting cast is another great aspect in this film that is rare in other action films I have seen.  The action, acting, and everything else is brilliant in this explosive film.

853249,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,B0002ZDVEU,The Piper at the Gates,"[0, 0]","This being the second installment of the trilogy of Bourne films, this movie is pretty much a continuation of the first film. The story takes place about 2 years after the end of the first movie, where we find Jason Bourne trying to have a life of his own, but when he subquently gets dragged back into danger, the chase is on, and Bourne is out to find his own kind of justice, and once again trying to find who he is. Of course, new characters are introduced, this time its Pam Landy (played by Joan Allen) who is trying to chase down Bourne, and new twists and turns in the story begin to unfold. Much like the first film, what makes this film the most entertaining is the pacing. There's not a lot of dull parts here, and the chase scenes are pretty good. Though there are some complaints about the shaking hand-held camera work during some these scenes, some say it makes the film more real and gritty. For me, the camera work didn't bother that much, but I could understand how some may not like it. I really don't have anything that negative to say about the film. The acting, the story, and the editing are all good. As far as being better that The Bourne Identity, well..it's close, but not quite.

It turns out that his existence is being used by other unsavory sorts in the CIA to cover some dirty deed of their own (it links back to the previous movie...sort of). The movie bears close watching as the plot is, well, convoluted.

The ""Bourne"" franchise came to us back in 2002, vying for attention against the tepid likes of a re-incarnated Jack Ryan in ""The Sum of All Fears"". Starring Matt Damon, Bourne won hands down with its enjoyable romp of cross-European, high-tech escapades. Combining a reasonably gripping story with sufficient quotas of CGI-free excitement, ""The Bourne Identity"" filled a long deserted niche for many film buffs, and while it didn't exactly conjure the good old KGB vs. Everybody days, it nonetheless heralded a comeback for previously prominent big screen values.  In the first ""Bourne"" foray, Damon played super agent Jason Bourne, suffering from amnesia and struggling to find out who the hell operated him in the first place. Amid several well-crafted action segments and car chases, the movie depicted Bourne's stand against a shadowy covert conspiracy bent on keeping hidden from prying eyes and vindictive ex-operatives with too much time and gadgets on their hands. The sequel begins more or less where the first chapter left off. A liberated Bourne and his prequel-originated love interest Marie (Franke Potente) elope to exotic Goa beaches in India, eking out a bucolic existence there away from hapless intelligence agencies and brainwashed assassins.  But idyllic conditions like those were never meant to last, and Bourne's infamy soon catches up with him, at Marie's grisly expense. Turns out a new secret agenda has risen to the fore, threatening to entangle our reluctant master spy. A pissed off Bourne therefore ventures to locate those responsible for Marie buying the farm, as well as clear his own name.While just as thrilling as its senior, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" reveals a major flaw even in the moniker given it: Matt Damon's indefatigable protagonist simply has too many moves, abilities, and lives for his own good. Believability aside, at some point the agent's uncanny expertise begins to grate, not gelling at all with his supposed cluelessness and so-called desperate situation. Would you be desperate if you had a seemingly endless supply of cash of every denomination, nine passports, and ready made weapons that materialize out of thin air?  To fluff up ""Supremacy""s plot and distinguish it from ""Identity"", the newer flick features increased complexity and multiple conflicts in need of resolution, thus paving the way for additional episodes, should the need be felt. Bourne presently faces ghosts harking back to his former employers, Treadstone, plus a few new ones courtesy of that by-now obligatory action movie stalwart, the Russian mafia. The ever-menacing Brian Cox (""The Ring"", ""X2"", ""Troy"") returns as a suspiciously uncooperative would-be ally, tagging along for the ride while CIA chief Landry (Joan Allen) tries to organize a legitimate search for the missing renegade professional. Karl Urban (""The Chronicles of Riddick"", ""The Lord of the Rings"") adds intimidation via a calculating Russian hit-man, and Julia Stiles contributes selected pouty facial expressions, minimally augmenting Supremacy's lineage and ties to its cinematic forebear.  But all of these characters can't mask the movie's slightly more-of-the-same feel. Despite an astonishingly accomplished car chase through Moscow in a puzzlingly sturdy old taxi, impressive shots of Berlin and pervasively consistent levels of suspense, overall impressions lead us to conclude ""Supremacy"" fails to surpass the first outing, resulting in superfluous baggage of the infuriatingly addictive variety. Expectations for whatever comes next in the action series, presumably Ludlum's Bourne ""Ultimatum"", should be kept to moderate thresholds of feasibility. Do not anticipate something bombastic or marvelously ground-breaking, but certainly look forward to more capable antics from the indestructible Damon and his box office panache.",3,The Bourne Supremacy  (2004),1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,4225,"['Director', 'Paul', 'GreengrassCast', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'Gabriel', 'Mann', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'Marton', 'Csokas', 'Tom', 'Gallop', 'John', 'Bedford', 'Lloyd.Running', 'Time', '109', 'minutesRated', 'PG-13', 'violence', 'intense', 'action', 'brief', 'language.Unearthing', 'decent', 'spy', 'movies', 'post-cold', 'war', 'epoch', 'often', 'wild', 'goose', 'chase', 'true', 'gems', 'few', 'far', 'Bourne', 'franchise', 'came', 'back', '2002', 'vying', 'attention', 'tepid', 'likes', 're-incarnated', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'Starring', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Bourne', 'won', 'hands', 'down', 'enjoyable', 'romp', 'cross-European', 'high-tech', 'escapades', 'Combining', 'reasonably', 'gripping', 'story', 'sufficient', 'quotas', 'CGI-free', 'excitement', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'filled', 'long', 'deserted', 'niche', 'many', 'film', 'buffs', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'conjure', 'good', 'old', 'KGB', 'Everybody', 'days', 'nonetheless', 'heralded', 'comeback', 'previously', 'prominent', 'big', 'screen', 'values', 'first', 'Bourne', 'foray', 'Damon', 'played', 'super', 'agent', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'suffering', 'amnesia', 'struggling', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'hell', 'operated', 'first', 'place', 'Amid', 'several', 'well-crafted', 'action', 'segments', 'car', 'chases', 'movie', 'depicted', 'Bourne', 'stand', 'shadowy', 'covert', 'conspiracy', 'bent', 'keeping', 'hidden', 'prying', 'eyes', 'vindictive', 'ex-operatives', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'gadgets', 'hands', 'sequel', 'more', 'less', 'where', 'first', 'chapter', 'left', 'off', 'liberated', 'Bourne', 'prequel-originated', 'love', 'interest', 'Marie', 'Franke', 'Potente', 'elope', 'exotic', 'Goa', 'beaches', 'India', 'eking', 'out', 'bucolic', 'existence', 'away', 'hapless', 'intelligence', 'agencies', 'brainwashed', 'assassins', 'idyllic', 'conditions', 'were', 'never', 'meant', 'last', 'Bourne', 'infamy', 'soon', 'up', 'Marie', 'grisly', 'expense', 'out', 'new', 'secret', 'agenda', 'risen', 'fore', 'threatening', 'entangle', 'reluctant', 'master', 'spy', 'pissed', 'off', 'Bourne', 'therefore', 'ventures', 'locate', 'responsible', 'Marie', 'buying', 'farm', 'as', 'well', 'clear', 'own', 'name.While', 'just', 'as', 'thrilling', 'senior', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'major', 'flaw', 'even', 'moniker', 'given', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'indefatigable', 'protagonist', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'moves', 'abilities', 'own', 'good', 'Believability', 'aside', 'point', 'agent', 'uncanny', 'expertise', 'grate', 'not', 'gelling', 'supposed', 'cluelessness', 'so-called', 'desperate', 'situation', 'Would', 'be', 'desperate', 'had', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'supply', 'cash', 'denomination', 'nine', 'passports', 'ready', 'made', 'weapons', 'materialize', 'thin', 'air', 'fluff', 'up', 'Supremacy', 's', 'plot', 'distinguish', 'Identity', 'newer', 'flick', 'features', 'increased', 'complexity', 'multiple', 'conflicts', 'need', 'resolution', 'thus', 'paving', 'way', 'additional', 'episodes', 'should', 'need', 'be', 'felt', 'Bourne', 'presently', 'ghosts', 'harking', 'back', 'former', 'employers', 'Treadstone', 'few', 'new', 'ones', 'courtesy', 'by-now', 'obligatory', 'action', 'movie', 'stalwart', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'ever-menacing', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Ring', 'X2', 'Troy', 'suspiciously', 'uncooperative', 'would-be', 'ally', 'tagging', 'along', 'ride', 'CIA', 'chief', 'Landry', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'organize', 'legitimate', 'search', 'missing', 'renegade', 'professional', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'intimidation', 'calculating', 'Russian', 'hit-man', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'selected', 'pouty', 'facial', 'expressions', 'minimally', 'augmenting', 'Supremacy', 'lineage', 'ties', 'cinematic', 'forebear', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'mask', 'movie', 'slightly', 'more-of-the-same', 'feel', 'astonishingly', 'accomplished', 'car', 'chase', 'Moscow', 'puzzlingly', 'sturdy', 'old', 'taxi', 'impressive', 'shots', 'Berlin', 'pervasively', 'consistent', 'levels', 'suspense', 'overall', 'impressions', 'lead', 'conclude', 'Supremacy', 'surpass', 'first', 'outing', 'resulting', 'superfluous', 'baggage', 'infuriatingly', 'addictive', 'variety', 'Expectations', 'next', 'action', 'series', 'presumably', 'Ludlum', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'should', 'be', 'kept', 'moderate', 'thresholds', 'feasibility', 'Do', 'not', 'anticipate', 'something', 'bombastic', 'marvelously', 'ground-breaking', 'certainly', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'capable', 'antics', 'indestructible', 'Damon', 'box', 'office', 'panache']",N/A

853253,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B0002ZDVEU,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[2, 2]","Movie - 5.0As I said in my review of the first film, I stand by the belief that the Bourne franchise has ultimately changed the face of spy-thriller movies forever. Sure, the occasional flashy James Bond flick was fun to watch, but there's only so much style you can take after a while till it becomes a bit redundant. Thankfully, these Bourne films were so successful that they were able to re-imagine Agent 007 in a different light, a dark, grittier one that you can clearly see in their current films since Daniel Craig took over the title. But that's beside the point. The point is that I'm really, really thankful because if Doug Liman and Paul Greengrass never directed these, who knows what kind of mediocrity we'd be having to put up with instead. The Bourne Supremacy opens up 2 years after the end of Identity. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and Marie (Franka Potente) are living in Goa supposedly out of the grasp of anyone looking to find them. Bourne has recently begun having nightmares about a man and woman he once assassinated, but still can't manage to piece together anything else relevant between that and his past days in Treadstone. Meanwhile, an operation in Berlin to uncover a mole amongst the top CIA brass, led by Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), goes south when a Russian federal agent, Kirill (Karl Urban), infiltrates the deal and takes out the informant while leaving a fingerprint of Bourne to cover his tracks. Then in an attempt to put Bourne out of the picture, Marie is killed in his stead. Grieved and angered by the loss, Bourne sets out to find those responsible. However, in his pursuit of vengeance, he would discover things about his past that would change him for the better.The Bourne Identity was a refreshing breath of fresh air showing us a man who, at one point, was a cold-blooded killer doing his duty, but upon certain events had a change of heart. A major reason for that was because of a woman he met, a woman that stayed with him and showed him the side of life he had been missing out on. Upon losing her, this man would once again fall into the web of coverups, deception, and lies in search of truth, retribution, and eventual redemption. As if Identity didn't establish the humanity within Bourne enough, Supremacy takes that aspect even further by provoking an act of pure, motivated revenge, that otherwise evolves into a search for inner peace and a realization of humility. With this being the first of director Paul Greengrass' installments, the pacing of both the plot and action are doubly intensified. In addition, the cinematography, fight and stunt choreography, music, and production easily surpass its predecessor. The camera cuts are as quick and vicious as Bourne's ability to take people out, the fights more brutal, the chases more adrenaline-pumping, the music more pulsating, and best of all, the story more symbolic. This definitely takes care of the emotional side of the story arc, and even then, the final part of trilogy will manage to surpass that. Keep going, you're almost done.Video - 5.0- Video codec: VC-1- Video resolution: 1080p- Aspect ratio: 2.35:1- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1Same director of photography, different director for the movie. The result: an amazing and visceral image compared to the first one! Paul Greengrass did a superb job not only propelling the franchise to new heights with the story, but also with the aesthetic presentation. Black levels are very deep (maybe a little too deep for some) making that sense of mystery and intrigue established in Identity that much more mysterious and intriguing. Even as hot and bright as the colors are in the Goa scenes, the blacks and more balanced contrast give the overall image so much more definition. The colors, by the way, are quite bold this time around. Goa alone has an exuberant amount of reds, oranges, and browns that make you feel like you're in the heat with Bourne and Marie. And even with a very fine layer of grain, detail and sharpness remain intact. Just look a the sweat running down the characters' faces, the texturing in the trees, ground objects, and street markets. And only a fraction of the movie even takes place here.The journey to Berlin is considerably darker, with a lot of the backdrops having more opaque set pieces, more interior shots (with small rooms and such), and a few more scenes shot at nighttime. The black levels are amazing here, but there's surprisingly a sparse amount of noise and grain to get in the way. And finally, the last part of the film in Moscow has a lot of color differentiation. The car chase sequence displays excellent detail in terms of line delineation and object clarity, especially when things start crashing and parts, glass, and other debris go flying around the street. My favorite shots for reference are the scene in Goa when Kirill is standing on the beach looking for Bourne (lots of color), the scene in Munich when Bourne pays a visit to the sole remaining Treadstone agent (lots of grain, but also lots of detail considering how close up the shots are), and finally the car chase in the Moscow tunnel (a little dim, but not super-dark, and again, lots of grain and detail). Some people may think the grain is a bit excessive, but I love the filmic texture it adds. And because of that I can't find any fault in the video.Audio - 5.0Languages- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1- French: DTS 5.1- Spanish: DTS 5.1Subtitles- English SDH, French, SpanishIn conjunction with the newer cinematography, the sound is also vastly improved. While the quality in Identity was pretty top-notch itself, there weren't enough moments for it to truly shine. The design and mixing in Supremacy, however, is quite aggressive. The biggest upgrade I noticed immediately is the general immersion. Scenes like the bustling streets of Goa or the protest rally at Alexanderplatz offer all kinds of separation and directionality. You can hear individual vehicles making noise, people talking, the change in volume when objects are in the way, the transference of sounds when the camera pans or cuts to a different angle, and these aren't even the real action sequences. Stuff like the foot chase in Berlin and the car chase in Moscow offer even more sonic perfection in terms of subtlety, dynamic range, and overall buoyancy. My favorite aspects of the audio, though, are its isolation, and the way the music is used. Particularly, I really love the scene where Bourne fights the last Treadstone agent. There's absolutely no music here, and the fight itself is contained in this small little area where you can hear every punch, shuffle, footstep, knife swipe, and paper slap without a single exterior source to disturb it. I personally think this is the most intense scene of the entire film, and a lot of it has to do with the sound, or lack thereof.And then there's the music. The more I keep listening to the score and sampling all the various parts of the movie for reference, the more I'm starting to like John Powell. As a composer, he really lets loose here with the strings and drums. The level at which the music is played is as subtle as the movie's sound effects, and when the pieces actually are played, it really puts you in the scene. LFEs are especially pounding, as the score pulsates and propels the action. Meanwhile, the car chase is probably the other big sequence to pay attention to. The cars running into each other and crashing offer up some pretty good rumbles that, if you have a decent sound system, should provide plenty of room-shaking bass. And yes, like the story itself, the sound gets even better in Ultimatum.Extras - 4.5- Audio Commentary (Director Paul Greengrass)This is a much different commentary than what Doug Liman gave for Identity. While Liman talked a lot about the technical aspects of the filming, Greengrass goes very in-depth about the writing and how he wanted to present certain themes/ideas through the action, especially in the way it was shot. A lot of people complain about the shaky camerawork and quick editing, but Greengrass repeatedly emphasizes how he wanted to keep it ""real"" (which is also presented as a short featurette on its own in the special features). In allowing the cameras to be handheld and literally follow Bourne's character in everything he does, its intent is to put the audience with him, as well as give the film a more gritty feel. He constantly breaks down key moments of the film as they unfold and goes on to talk about the actors, namely, why he cast them, what he liked about them, and how their personalities reflected well in their characters. There were a few more dead spots in this commentary than there were with Liman's, but it's just as informative and worth a listen.- Explosive Deleted Scenes (SD; 10:46)Not much to say about them.- Matching Identities: Casting (SD; 5:23)Talks about the casting. Greengrass starts off by giving Damon high praise for his ability to play both sides of Bourne so well (the tortured soul, and the ruthless killer). He also says he liked the choice of Allen to play Landy, as he thinks she's quite classy, much like Chris Cooper was for his role in Identity. He then goes on to talk about the film not having one bad guy, but that they were all part of a bad system (which will become very important for the third film).- Keeping it Real (SD; 4:58)Talks about the process of selecting Greengrass to become the new director of the franchise. He says he wanted to portray a truthfulness and realism, which shows through the shaky-camera cinematography. He also makes the point of not wanting the actors to think too much so that their movements are more instinctual and intense.- Blowing Things Up (SD; 4:00)Shows how they blew up the house in Munich and how they didn't us any CG because they wanted more realism to it. Interestingly enough, they got the whole shot in just one take.- On the Move with Jason Bourne (SD; 4:45)Takes a look at the scouting and talks about how they wanted to film the real places in Europe for the film. Berlin was chosen for its historical relevance and as an homage to old spy stories. Moscow was chosen because the city itself has never really been used for movies and because Greengrass felt it gave off a vibe of truthfulness. And then Goa was chosen because it reflected the exuberance and restlessness represented in Bourne's character at that moment in the film.- Bourne to be Wild: Fight Training (SD; 4:21)Shows us the staging for the fight between Bourne and the last remaining Treadstone agent. Fight coordinator Jeff Imada goes over the basic concept of the Kali style used, Greengrass points out how he wanted to really use Venetian blinds for the aesthetic of the scene and that he wanted the fight too look sloppy and raw, yet structured at the same time.- Crash Cam: Racing Through the Streets of Moscow (SD; 5:58)Shows us how the riveting car chase sequence was filmed. They wanted this to be better than the one in Identity by putting a sense of desperation in Bourne to get to his destination, and they did so by making all the cameras either loose or handheld and putting them either in the car or very close to the windows.- The Go-Mobile Revs Up the Action (SD; 6:49)Talks about the Go-Mobile, a camera rig that essentially attaches itself to the front end of a vehicle to put an actor right in the action of a car-driving sequence. They say it's built to be safe (with a very low center of gravity so it never tips over) and that it allows for a lot of different camera angles you wouldn't normally be able to get.- Anatomy of a Scene: The Explosive Bridge Chase Scene (SD; 4:40)A look at how the foot chase in Berlin was filmed. Damon says shooting it was safe and fun.- Scoring with John Powell (SD; 4:46)I love when we can actually take a look at the scoring of a film, especially here because I feel the music in the Bourne series is such an important driving force. Powell says he doesn't conduct, but likes to offer a lot of input during the process. He also says the score itself re-uses a lot of the themes from the first film, but that the new one created for Goa is meant to represent Marie and that it follows Bourne around till the end of the movie. Specifically, it's a theme that plays during her funeral scene, then comes full circle to symbolize his eventual atonement.- The Bourne Mastermind (Part 2) (SD; 4:42)More rehashed interviews with Ludlum that you might have already seen if you watched the ones on Identity. There's a little more additional retrospect here, but not much else.- The Bourne Diagnosis (Part 2) (SD; 5:39)Gives us a little more psychological analysis on Bourne, most notably how his flashbacks are tormenting him and how Marie represents his humanity and the choice of living. And upon her death, his quest for revenge sets Bourne on a journey to find his past and some eventual answers to what's been troubling him.- U-ControlMore interactive PiP applications that play during the film:- The Bourne DossierSame as the Treadstone Files option in Identity. It's just a bunch of statistics and factoids in the form of a gimmicky spy computer thingy for people, places, and certain situations. It's cool if you like trivia, but like I said, it's a bit of a novelty, if anything else.- Bourne OrientationRecaps of important plot points, though not in the sense of interviews like the actual PiP commentary. It's a bit redundant and totally okay to skip it.- Picture in PictureThe real meat of the extras. It's actually quite humorous at the beginning when producer Frank Marshall says that the feature was made exclusively for ""this HD-DVD,"" which obviously is a dead format now, but after that it's pure gold in terms of information. The PiP takes most of the footage from the other special features listed above. However, it also includes a very large amount of interviews and footage not included in said extras and is full of crucial commentary and analysis of the story itself, as well as a few anecdotes from cast and crew. Most of the feature has the actors breaking down their characters and talking about what it was like working with one another. I was very glad to hear interpretations from Brian Cox and Karl Urban, who play antagonists, but really don't get a whole lot of screen time in general to fully develop themselves. So to hear them talking about how the characters fit into the plot and what they thought about their roles was very interesting. This is by far the best special feature on this disc, and I wholly recommend you make it a mandatory watch if you're interested in the production of the film itself and its literary composition. And unlike the PiP in Identity, this one actually runs for the entire length of the movie, as opposed to 3-5 minute chunks for 8 chapters.Overall - 5.0While the franchise is changing directors at this point, the plot still continues to thicken. I find it to be an interesting take on the character of Jason Bourne. And to further iterate, I really, really thank the people involved because without the Bourne movie franchise, James Bond wouldn't have followed suit, and I don't think I would love the Daniel Craig movies as much as I do today. In the meantime, Universal presents Supremacy with some demo-worthy A/V specs and a deceptively informative set of extras. Do yourself a favor and get ready for a spy-thriller with a lot of heart, then prepare for an even more thrilling adventure in the final act, Ultimatum.",5,The Bourne Supremacy

853255,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B0002ZDVEU,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","The Bourne Supremacy is one of those films where the cast and the plotting are strong enough to survive some extremely bad direction from Paul Greengrass. Former documentarian Greengrass might be overcompensating for what is in essence a pretty commonplace revenge story, but it seems far more likely that he's inadvertently done his best to sabotage his own movie by over-rationalizing each scene without realising that when they're all put together his mixture of shakeycam incomprehensibility (often in scenes where there is no emotional or narrative need for it), redundant shifts of focus, overediting and overly dark photography just makes him come across as an unimaginative Michael Bay wannabe hack rather than creating an illusion of reality or placing the audience in his amnesiac hero's confused shoes. Indeed, he's giving the audience even LESS information and frequently obscuring the action because he's forgotten that just because HE knows what's going on doesn't mean the audience will. On the plus side, this is much less of a problem on the small screen than the big screen, where motion sickness and whiplash were real possibilities, but it's still disappointing considering that one of the great joys of the original was Doug Liman's old-school direction - it was genuinely refreshing to see action scenes where the director was showing you the scene instead of drawing attention to himself after so many years of MTV incomprehensibility. After the problems on the first film, there was no possibility of Liman returning. It's just a shame they couldn't hire a competent directorWith such a handicap, it's surprising that it works so very well - especially since there are few narrative surprises (you can guess the villain long before a trusting sacrificial lamb gives him a crucial piece of information at the cost of his life simply by scanning out the cast list and looking for the first likely typecast suspect to jump out at you). But then the fun of the first film wasn't what it did, but how it did it, particularly the practical ways Bourne evades and eludes his pursuers: the first car chase exists in a credible milieu, constantly thwarted by traffic jams and crowds. The film even manages to find an environment where Joan Allen's eternal humorlessness actually seems appropriate, and it's a genuine surprise that the film's climax is an emotional scene that effectively damns its hero even as he tries to unburden himself of guilt.

853257,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0002ZDVEU,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 4]","Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne, ultra-tough ex-secret agent of 'Bourne Supremacy.'  The story is, you know, not so great as some say, but not so bad either.  In a nutshell, Jason, still haunted by the fragmentary memories of his past, is framed again by someone whose identity is so obvious to us.[ONE GREAT ADDITION] But despite the film's many plot holes and contrived (and often silly) situations, Matt Damon is in great shape as Jason, the hero or deadly killing machine.  But most remarkable acting comes not from him, but from Joan Allen as Pamela Landy as leader of one botched CIA operation, who doggedly searchs for the truths behind the failure, Jason Bourne and his backgrounds.  Franka Potente, Julia Stiles, and Brian Cox return as the same characters as before, but their characters are not as memorable as Joan Allen's, who is most convincing in otherwise completely fictional world.[CAMERA WILL SHAKE, RATTLE, ROLL]  But what a hectic actions!  Sadly director Paul Greengrass nearly ruined the otherwise hair-raising actions with his shaky handy camera shots, which made me dizzy while looking at the screen.  Don't get me wrong.  His method might have worked in another field, like a suspence drama with a more social theme.In fact, the final car chase is one of the best in recent years, accompanied by a rousing score.  My vote goes to that of 'Ronin' but 'Bourne Supremacy' comes very close to that sphere.  But Paul Greengrass's ducumentary touch camerawork which follows the objects in a too hectic fashion should be called an utterly misguided idea.  Who needs a documentary touch when you see a film based on Robert Ludlum (no offence).  It's 100 % escapism in a good sense.Nest time please use a steady camera angle, show the stunts's jobs clearly (and the stunts themselves must be simply great, I imagine), and give us more thrills.

853258,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B0002ZDVEU,Tucker Andersen,"[1, 5]","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS NO SPOILERS.IN SUMMARY:First, this is a four or five star-action adventure movie but I have reduced the rating for the reasons discussed below;Second, view THE BOURNE IDENTITY first to put this story in context; andThird, the plot of this movie bears no relationship to Robert Ludlum's book with the same title and is very inferior to that book.If you simply want to have fun watching an action-adventure spy thriller with lots of over-the top chase scenes and even a few brief interjections of humor, then THE BOURNE SUPREMACY starring Matt Damon is definitely five star entertainment. But if you like a modicum of believabilty and a first rate plot, this movie falls a bit short. Most disappointingly for this reviewer, the only similarities to the book by Robert Ludlum bearing the same title were the fact that Jason Bourne is an agent still suffering from the amnesia which resulted from his assignment portrayed in THE BOURNE IDENTITY and that he is being framed for murders commited by others to further their own agendas.The movie opens dramatically with a CIA sting which goes terribly wrong, resulting in the death of an undercover operative and the loss both of his bankroll and the information which it was meant to purchase. It then immediately transitions to India, where Jason Bourne and Marie are still on the run and have lost themselves in a remote town as he attempts to gradually piece together the various fragmentary flashbacks of his past life. (In contrast, the book opens with Bourne having resumed his true identity and being provided therapy and protective custody by his former CIA handlers as he attempts to construct a normal life with Marie.) Further violence ensues and the two story threads come together in a way almost totally antithetical to Ludlum's tale. Agent Lundy (played by Joan Allen) is the the leader of the CIA team whose failed op leads to reopening the black op Project Tredstone file and reassembling much of the team from the previous film. (The continuity of the cast is a nice touch.) Although no film allows the level of complexity and nuanced detail of a nearly six hundred page Ludlum book, the story has enough plot twists to keep it interesting. and the final car chase scene is incredibly long and action filled. (The only problem is that in real life nothing short of a tank would be likely to survive the damage inflicted on Bourne's stolen taxicab.) Of course, in the end Jason will survive, various clues will have allowed more of his memory to be restored, many of the bad guys will be vanquished, and Matt Damon will have established the character Jason Bourne as the next prototypical hero who triumphs against overwhelming odds (including a faulty memory) in what will perhaps become a long running series of action-adventure thrillers.The major shortcoming of the film is that the deaths of the some of the characters central to the plots in the two subsequent novels, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM and the just published THE BOURNE LEGACY (review 7/8/2004), mean that by the conclusion of this film it has become impossible to pursue those intriguing storylines. Thus, the positive impact that those wonderful stories could have had in transferring the BOURNE brand to the movies is irrevocably dissipated. Undoubtedly, many readers of the books will share my disappointment in this divergence between Ludlum's development of Bourne's life and that depicted in this film. (Particularly since a series with several subsequent sequels is apparently planned.) This decision by the scriptwriters and producers is especially unfortunate in light of the fact that a major element which helped make the movie THE BOURNE IDENTITY so enjoyable was its fealty to both the powerful opening moment and dramatic conclusion of that book.I had several other minor dissatifactions not worth detailing. However, in contrast to the complaints  of many other reviewers regarding the cinematic style that involved the extensive use of hand held cameras, frequent close-in shots and rapid scene changes, I actually felt that the direction was very effective and my complaints were with the script. Also on the positive side, as in the best films of this genre the actual violence is usually brief (and often stylistic and suggestive rather than graphically detailed and gruesome). Furthermore, there is no use of the frequent profanity found in many movies as a substitute for any meaningful dialogue. If this movie had simply been titled THE BOURNE ADVENTURE, my overall rating would have been four-plus stars. But the false expectations created for Ludlum readers by the title deserve only a single star; this disappointment is compounded by the injustice done by the plot to Ludlum's conception of the essence of Bourne's character. In summary, my disappointment is sufficient that a rating of three-plus stars seems a fair compromise.Tucker Andersen",3,(3+) Five Star Action but DEFINITELY NOT LUDLUM'S STORY,1090886400,"07 27,

853260,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0002ZDVEU,Turfseer,"[0, 2]","When you strip 'The Bourne Supremacy"" down to its bare essentials, basically what you have is a high-powered, well-done chase movie. For the most part, it's non-stop action--and the producers were smart to enlist Paul Greenglass as the director. Greenglass films 'Supremacy' in a documentary style, making use of hand-held camera shots in many scenes. One of my favorite scenes where you really feel the events actually could have happened is when Bourne kills a fellow CIA agent in Munich and then blows up the house where the killing took place. Not only are the sequence of events leading up to the explosion choreographed masterfully(the fight scene, the lighting of the fuse, etc.) but the aftermath is equally effective--as Bourne drives away, the police are heading in the opposite direction toward the burning house which we glimpse in the distance.The plot to 'Supremacy' is more convoluted than complicated. In a nutshell, a rogue CIA agent conspires with Russian criminal elements to frame Bourne for two recent murders (also involving CIA agents). After a failed assassination attempt in India, Bourne escapes and is pursued by both the CIA and the Russians. Since he has amnesia, he's trying to figure out who's hunting him and why. Bourne eventually discovers he was part of a secret project called 'Treadstone' and was involved in the murder of a well-known Russian politician and his wife. The politician was set to expose the collusion between the rogue CIA agent (Abbott, convincingly played by Brian Cox) and the Russians.Matt Damon who plays Bourne, has very little dialogue in this movie. Damon usually gives capable performances but with little nuance. Nonetheless, the part calls for a great deal of physical action and Damon is up to the job. This is what he's good at--playing parts that require someone who's in great physical shape. What doesn't ring true is that Bourne is too much of a superman--a killing machine that basically no one can stop.The supporting players here are equally as good. There's a lot of nice conflict between Brian Cox's Abbott who seeks to stymie Joan Allen's Pamela Landy, the CIA deputy administrator from discovering that's he's the rogue agent responsible for all the trouble. The Russian assassin and his boss are equally realistic as menacing villains.'The Bourne Supremacy' was filmed on location in many different countries including India, Italy, Germany and Russia. This gives the film a great deal of its verisimilitude.'Supremacy' wears out its welcome in the final scenes. There's a car-chase sequence that's been done many times before and goes on for too long. And there's an additional scene tacked on at the end where Bourne visits the teenage daughter of the Russian politician where he reveals that he was actually responsible for murdering her parents. Whether Bourne was brainwashed at the time or whether he knew exactly what he was doing, the writers succeed in undermining Bourne's heroic status and we're left with a sour taste in our mouths after realizing Bourne really isn't such a good guy after all.Forget about Supremacy's thin plot and the Bourne character's moral turpitude.

Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has been quietly living in Goa, India with girlfriend Marie. He still suffers from amnesia and can't remember much about his past except for snippets that come to him in dreams. He writes these things down in a journal trying to piece together his forgotten and shattered past. Meanwhile, back in Berlin, an expensive and important CIA operation is blotched when some important files are stolen and a key informant is killed. The killer &#34;leaves&#34; a fingerprint behind and the print turns out to belong to Jason Bourne. This leads Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) to begin a worldwide search for Bourne to bring him in for questioning. Back in India, Jason and Marie plan their get away from a Russian hit man, but things turn tragic. Two years ago Bourne told the CIA to leave him alone. He thinks they're after him again and he begins a mission to show the intelligent agency just who really is supreme.THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is a worthy sequel to the original THE BOURNE IDENTITY. The movie continues the story and as the film develops, we learn more not only about Bourne's past, but about other characters from the original film, too. The acting is extremely well done, especially for an action/espionage movie. Especially noteworthy is Matt Damon who portrays Bourne perfectly. One of the tag lines for the film &#34;Matt Damon is Jason Bourne&#34; isn't just a cool saying.The only major negative I found with the movie was quick cuts from one scene to another. I don't know why this has become the popular thing to do with fighting movies nowadays, but instead of making a film or movie more interesting, it proves to be a big distraction.

First and for most (SPOILER ALERT)...They kill off his ugly dog faced girlfriend right at the beginning.A couple of other reasons are these:1)Brian Cox is a great actor and is good in everything I have seen him in.2)Joan Allen is also great.3) Julia Styles... not so great. Why the hell she was even in the first one is beyond me. For god sake she stinks as an actress but her part in the first one was almost nonexistent so I can only assume a great majority of her part must have ended up on the cutting room floor, no great loss. But then they bring this schlub of an actress back and expand her part. The only thing that was good about her was when I thought that Jason Bourne might actually be ruthless enough to kill her.The villians in this are also really good.  Damon is pretty good as an actor though his really large head is sometimes distracting but he makes his buddy Bad Actor...er... I mean Affleck look like somebody from you kindergarten play that portrayed a tree cause he couldn't keep his booger eatin' finger out of his nose long enough to speak and chew gum at the same time.

853265,A5X1B2HBQUR3P,B0002ZDVEU,"Vikram Ramanathan ""Live to Learn""","[0, 0]","A fast paced zippy action film. The director shoots the movie like you are experiencing the events that Jason Bourne is experiencing. The whole movie has a real life edgy feel to it due to the fact that no steadycam was used so the camera keeps shaking and gives you this documentary real life feel to it. There are very few dolly shots in the movies, it all with handheld camera. The camera is placed in specific angles and hard to reach places like the inside of the car so that you feel a lot like being in Jason's seat. The extras feature have quite a bit on how they shot the chase scene, the fight moves and the special car rig that they built to get the shots. The car chase scene is one of the greatest chases captured on film. It's hard and fast and ends with full impact. The movie does not follow the book. Ludlum's novels Bourne - Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum document his life as he grows old in fact in Ultimatum if I am not mistaken he is a senior citizen with kids and grand kids. The movie version takes book 1 and expands on it and uses the Bourne franchise name. I have no problem with that. The books as it were would not have worked in the medium of film. Good action flick. Watch Bourne always outsmart the CIA.

853268,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0002ZDVEU,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[21, 32]","The second film in a series makes or breaks a potential franchise. If the second Bond film had done poorly there's no doubt that that would have been the end. The same for the ""Star Trek"" film series (featuring either the original stars or ""The Next Generation""). So the industry paid close attention to ""The Bourne Supremacy"". Had Matt Damon metamorphosed into an action star or was the first film just a fluke? ""The Bourne Supremacy"" proved that Damon and the potential of this film series passed the litmus test. Taking up where the first film ended, Bourne (Matt Damon) is framed for a CIA assassination forcing him to go on the run. He and Marie (Franka Potente) must pull up stakes in the sleepy seaside town where they've begun to make a life together. Bourne retaliates against the agents he used to call friends when he was an assassin in an intricate game of cat and mouse comparable to the first film. A warning about the film if you have a weak stomach is that much of this was shot using handheld cameras and creates the impression of a wild amusement ride during the action sequences. You may want to have your motion sickness pills close at hand.Avoiding the spooky look of traditional cloak and dagger films, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" has the more modern jittery look of films like ""Die Hard"". The colors weren't vibrant in the original film but fairly subdued most of the time and they are well reproduced here with a sharp, clear and clean picture full of solid blacks. There's a touch of edge enhancement during a couple of sequences but it's kept to a minimum and is, for the most part, fairly subtle. The booming sound of the production receives a lively transfer using the surround speakers for maximum effect. One advantage of an action-thriller is that things are always faster, louder and over dramatic and those very qualities come alive in the 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound mix.Like the original film (and its recent double dip DVD re-release), ""The Bourne Supremacy"" makes the most of the DVD format with some stunning examples in the way of extras. While the featurettes could have been combined into one larger documentary, the Special Features Producer evidently felt that the audience for this film had untreated ADHD as the longest featurette runs about 7 minutes. With nine featurettes included on the making of the film, fans will get an exhaustive glimpse behind the curtain at how the various effects were achieved for the film. Beginning with ""Casting"" we hear from director Greengrass about the challenges of selecting a strong personality and powerful actor to hold his or her own with actors like Brian Cox on screen. ""Keeping It Real"", ""Blowing Things Up"" and ""On the Move with Jason Bourne"" focus on everything from the location shooting in Moscow, the various physical effects employed on the set to create the spectacular action sequences and how the crew made it seem as if Matt Damon was doing all the driving in the riveting chase sequences. Damon also discusses some of the stunt driving training that he underwent for the sequences where he was behind the wheel. While he wasn't alone (I don't want to spoil it for you), it clearly gave him the confidence as an actor to believe he was driving the vehicle while in character.There's also a discussion of how some of the more complex camera moves were achieved during the shooting of the film. ""The Go-Mobile Revs up the Action"" discusses the device they used to achieve the look of Damon driving and allowed some of the dangerous driving stunts appear even more dangerous on film. Featuring both producer Frank Marshall and Matt Damon, this sequence breaks down how these sequences were broken up so that the most amazing shots could be done with Damon actually in the action.  ""Anatomy of a Scene"" breaks down the sequence near the conclusion involving a bridge chase, a jump off the bridge and landing on a barge. The final featurette has composer John Powell discussing his approach to scoring the film. A warning on all of these featurettes-don't want them until you see the movie otherwise the entire film will be spoiled for you.Some of the deleted scenes add character moments for Brian Cox, Joan Allen, Matt Damon and other cast members but would have slowed down the film. While they are importantly sequences (and are of the type that will probably be incorporated into a ""Director's Cut"" ten years down the line) for the characters, they don't add anything to the story itself and slow down the overall momentum of the film.A strong sequel to the first film, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" can stand on its own as a strong extension of the original thriller. The image quality is quite good. Keep in mind the washed out quality of the images and the slightly greenish tinge in many of the interior sequences was intended. With a nine featurettes that combined run about 46 minutes, the reality is that all nine featurettes could have easily been integrated into a single documentary on the making of the film. With scene access you would have gotten about the same results as the featurettes.  A fine film that may have you reaching for your armrest to hold on for a wild ride, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" will keep you on the edge of your seat.",4,"Sneak peak at ""The Bourne Supremacy""

853269,A1BS8YM712C0VJ,B0002ZDVEU,Will Culp,"[3, 8]","The Bourne Supremacy(2004). The Second Movie In The Jason Bourne Series.In 2002, 'The Bourne Identity', starring Matt Damon and based on the novel by Robert Ludlum of the same name, became the sleeper hit of the summer, easily earning over  $150 million dollars and garnering much critical acclaim. A solid mixture of espionage, amnesia, mystery, and intense car chases and battle sequences held the audiences attention throughout, not to mention stellar acting. It's no surprise that the sequel to 'The Bourne Identity' was released, since there was already a novel for it! In 2004, 'The Bourne Supremacy' was released, and while the critics weren't as warm to it as last time, it still got big crowds in and (as of August 30th) has earned over $150 million like its predecessor. I was a big fan of the first movie, so did I enjoy the sequel or not? Read on to find out!Plot-Jason Bourne, after escaping the clutches of the CIA, goes into a peaceful seclusion with his girlfriend in India. Although he thinks that he's going to be left alone, he's framed by a Russian assassin for the murder of two CIA operatives, and once again the CIA's after him. As the whole world collectively cracks down on Jason Bourne, he travels all around Asia and Europe, risking his life to find out who framed him and to avenge his girlfriend's death. From Naples, to Berlin, to Moscow, Jason hunts down the assassin and further solves the mysteries of his past life as a CIA operative.Opinions-Right off the bat, fans of the first movie will be kind of taken aback, since 'The Bourne Supremacy' has absolutely nothing to do with it, and if you're new to the series, you won't have trouble with the story. Matt Damon does a great job of acting the part of a disillusioned hitman on the run, while the other actors also do a notable job. Although the story drags at some parts, 'The Bourne Supremacy' basically keeps the viewer interested, but at times you are left wondering ""what just happened?"" or ""who's that?"", or the scene's just flat-out boring and meaningless to the plot. In the beginning of the movie, I had no clue what was happening, which is very rare for me. Also, in the second movie, the plot, while being *good*, is flat-out terrible compared to the original movie's. The characters are less enjoyable, the story's predictable, and there's absolutely NO suspense or mystery, totally unlike the first and disappointing in its own right. Another problem I have with the movie is the camerawork: Although not being as bad as 'The Blair Witch Project' or 'Open Water', whoever the cameraman was for this movie should see a doctor, because he's either got Parkinson's Disease or an uncontrollable twitch. The camera, throughout, NEVER stops shaking! During the chase scenes, it's hard to even know what's going on! Anyways, the movie is interesting, if not a bit unfocused. On the positive note, there is good acting and very well-done chase scenes, but don't come in expecting anything near as good as the first, or else you'll be disappointed.Overall, 'The Bourne Supremacy' hits that famous sophomore slump, sporting a weak plot and uninteresting developments, but still containing some rewarding moments(taxi chase anyone?) and good acting. What's odd about this movie, and really made me wonder, is why a Spy/Action movie has NO suspense or mystery! Odd! Likewise, the movie is extremely predictable, since there's nothing to predict! You already know the answers, you just see Bourne figure them out for himself out. (...)RECOMMEDED FOR FANS OF THE FIRST MOVIE AND THE ROBERT LUDLUM NOVELS.

Fewer are better than a very good original. Even fewer are lots better. This is one.This movie stands well by itself, but also follows seamlessly from the first. Our hero, Bourne, has escaped a career as a government assassin. He is living a small, happy life in a remote village, with the woman he loves. Then she is killed in an attempt on his life. Bourne has just declared war on the CIA, and the CIA had better defend itself.After that, the movie is pretty much one long chase scene. Saying almost anything more would give away one of the movie's surprises, and the movie is full of surprises. I can tell you that the big car chase is a great sample of its kind, with lots of banging around in narrow, crowded streets. I'd certainly put my money on Bourne in any demolition derby.A few characters from the first movie have roles here, creating a strong continuity across the two. Watch for changes in the characters' roles, though - there always seems to be one more surprise ahead, right to the last seconds of the movie.This is a very good spy/action flick. The characters are all larger than life, without crossing over into distortion. The action starts at a run, the pace just picks up until the very end, and insistently pulls the viewer along.

Unfortunately, this surprisingly unfocused sequel joins the ranks of INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM and BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II as examples of the law of diminishing returns. In THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, amnesiac/CIA assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is once again forced out into the open when he's framed for murder. It's hardly the most original premise for a sophomore effort in a cinematic franchise, but surely it could have been told in a more coherent and better-paced fashion that what's being served up here.In attempting to justify the continuance of a story that was wrapped up neatly in the first film, Bourne becomes a darker personality and, as a result, a far less likable character. Do we really care if he clears himself of a phony murder rap when we learn he's actually guilty of other crimes? This fatal misstep is compounded by aimless dialogue sequences bereft of genuine suspense and action scenes that are tossed in willy-nilly because that's what the filmmakers think the audience wants. A note to the filmmakers: What the audience wants is a thriller that doesn't try our patience or insult our sensibilities by thinking we'll accept a truckload of espionage clich&eacute;s in lieu of a well-conceived screenplay.A great deal of THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is Supremely Dull, despite the chases, explosions, and gunplay.

Paul Greengrass' all shaking, all shifting, never focusing, never resting camera. to say his action scenes are over active is like saying that micheal moore might have an opinion or two about george bush. as soon as the scene is set and a typed title lets us know where we are, the cameras are strapped onto the backs of a herd of fidgety five year olds and the scene is constructed from the higgledy-piggledy that results. lets see if we cant agree on at least a couple of things; a fast handheld zoom-in on a chracter may be dramatic and may work to let the audience know, &quot;keep your eye on this one.&quot; but zooming in three times on three different characters (a total of nine) in under thirty seconds (possibly an exageration but not by much) serves no purpose but to make the veiwer feel like the story has been abandoned and replaced by a coked-up advertisement for cosmetics. second, its not fair to assume that a chracter has all the humanity he needs left over from a previous outing. this picture gives jason bourne nothing human to feel, do, or say. the film seems completely concious that the only reason we are there is beacuse we saw the first one and it seems to trust that the connections will hold. some will say that bourne's next to last act in the movie is all we need, to see him as human. but thats at the end. it is reseting him as a person for part three. ineffectively i might add. the only way for him to redeem himself after that many killings and car crashes is to offer himself as a sacrifice to the emotional health of his victims. instead he finds closure that he didnt earn as a human. robots dont get redeemable coupons for human depth.i understand that it probably isnt fair to compare kids to their older syblings and i am likely performing a terrible injustice, judging the bourne supremacy on the template of its predacessor. but the truth is it is a bad movie, hard to watch and unrewarding. it just so happens that the bourne

853278,A2HE4RHOGMWDV8,B0002ZDVEU,Young Kim,"[106, 125]","There are no world domination conspiracies.  No extravagant super-gadgets.  No deadly supermodels and megalomaniac geniuses.  Just Bourne, his wits, a couple of guns, and whatever else he can get his hands on.Firmly entrenched in reality (as much as having a martial arts expert with photographic memory, incredible marksmanship and driving skills, coupled with fluency in at least four languages, and spycraft/black ops training is feasible in the real world), The Bourne Supremacy follows in the footsteps of The Bourne Identity to deliver solid action which is a refreshing break from the cartoon shenanigans of Bond.The film opens two years after the events of The Bourne Identity, where Jason Bourne, a black ops assassin played by Matt Damon, had become amnesiac and severed his ties with the CIA.  Jason and his lover, Maria, played once again by the German actress Franka Potente, have been skipping around the globe and are currently hiding in India.  However, events beyond his control conspire to drag him back to the conspiracies and machinations of hidden players.  An undercover CIA agent is murdered in Berlin, and all the evidence points to Bourne.  Brian Cox, Julia Stiles, and some minor players return from the first movie, and Joan Allen is introduced as a high level CIA administrator who wants to track Bourne down.  There are plenty of twists and turns along the way, lots of globetrotting, including visits to Paris, Berlin, and Moscow, and great set pieces.The return of most of the cast from the first movie serves as a great means of establishing continuity.  Strangely enough, Ms. Stiles is once again delegated to a very minor role (in the first movie, she was little more than a glorified phone operator), but this time around, she has a key scene with Mr. Damon.  Ms. Allen has great presence and manages to hold her own in her many scenes with Mr. Cox.  Mr. Damon thoroughly inhabits the role of Bourne, convincingly playing a ruthless assassin who, despite intense conditioning to be a remorseless killer, is struggling to regain his humanity.  Mr. Damon has once again spent considerable time conditioning himself for the role, and it shows.  He is lean, fit, and utterly believable in his fighting sequences.  However, more than being just another action hero, Mr. Damon also brings convincing intelligence to the role.  The audience can believe that Bourne is constantly thinking two steps ahead of everyone else, that anything can become a weapon in his hands, that he is always considering a way out, and that every act, even simply picking up a bottle of vodka, has a reason.The image quality of the DVD is excellent, although in parts it seemed too dark.  The filming technique used by the director, which involves extensive use of hand-held and shoulder-mounted cameras, has been much criticized, and must have been a dizzying experience in the movie theater, but in the confines of a big screen TV, it serves to bring the viewer right into the action.  Granted, some of the quick editing and shaky camera work make a few of the fight scenes claustrophobic and confusing, but that seems to be the desired effect.  There are a handful of deleted scenes (which are of much lower video quality and don't really add much to the plot; they are also all strung together - one cannot select individual deleted scenes), director's comment track, and some other production segments.  I have not heard the director's commentary or examined the other documentaries, yet.  One nitpick of the DVD is Universal's decision to add unskippable advertising at the beginning.  One cannot press menu to escape; one is forced to fast forward through the useless ads.Highly recommended.",4,The opposite of Bond...and very good for it,1103068800,"12 15, 2004",2004,3705,"['are', 'world', 'domination', 'conspiracies', 'extravagant', 'super-gadgets', 'deadly', 'supermodels', 'megalomaniac', 'geniuses', 'Just', 'Bourne', 'wits', 'couple', 'guns', 'else', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'on.Firmly', 'entrenched', 'reality', 'as', 'much', 'having', 'martial', 'arts', 'expert', 'photographic', 'memory', 'incredible', 'marksmanship', 'driving', 'skills', 'coupled', 'fluency', 'least', 'four', 'languages', 'spycraft/black', 'ops', 'training', 'feasible', 'real', 'world', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'footsteps', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'deliver', 'solid', 'action', 'refreshing', 'break', 'cartoon', 'shenanigans', 'Bond.The', 'film', 'two', 'years', 'events', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'where', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'black', 'ops', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'had', 'become', 'amnesiac', 'severed', 'ties', 'CIA', 'Jason', 'lover', 'Maria', 'played', 'once', 'again', 'German', 'actress', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'have', 'been', 'skipping', 'globe', 'are', 'currently', 'hiding', 'India', 'However', 'events', 'control', 'conspire', 'drag', 'back', 'conspiracies', 'machinations', 'hidden', 'players', 'undercover', 'CIA', 'agent', 'murdered', 'Berlin', 'evidence', 'points', 'Bourne', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'minor', 'players', 'return', 'first', 'movie', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'introduced', 'high', 'level', 'CIA', 'administrator', 'who', 'track', 'Bourne', 'down', 'are', 'plenty', 'twists', 'along', 'way', 'lots', 'globetrotting', 'including', 'visits', 'Paris', 'Berlin', 'Moscow', 'great', 'set', 'pieces.The', 'return', 'most', 'cast', 'first', 'movie', 'great', 'means', 'establishing', 'continuity', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'Ms.', 'Stiles', 'once', 'again', 'delegated', 'very', 'minor', 'role', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'glorified', 'phone', 'operator', 'time', 'around', 'key', 'scene', 'Mr.', 'Damon', 'Ms.', 'Allen', 'great', 'presence', 'manages', 'hold', 'own', 'many', 'scenes', 'Mr.', 'Cox', 'Mr.', 'Damon', 'thoroughly', 'role', 'Bourne', 'convincingly', 'playing', 'ruthless', 'assassin', 'who', 'intense', 'conditioning', 'be', 'remorseless', 'killer', 'struggling', 'regain', 'humanity', 'Mr.', 'Damon', 'once', 'again', 'spent', 'considerable', 'time', 'conditioning', 'role', 'lean', 'fit', 'utterly', 'believable', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'However', 'more', 'being', 'just', 'action', 'hero', 'Mr.', 'Damon', 'also', 'convincing', 'intelligence', 'role', 'audience', 'can', 'believe', 'Bourne', 'constantly', 'thinking', 'two', 'steps', 'ahead', 'everyone', 'else', 'anything', 'can', 'become', 'weapon', 'hands', 'always', 'considering', 'way', 'act', 'even', 'simply', 'picking', 'up', 'bottle', 'vodka', 'reason.The', 'image', 'quality', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'parts', 'seemed', 'too', 'dark', 'filming', 'technique', 'used', 'director', 'extensive', 'use', 'hand-held', 'shoulder-mounted', 'cameras', 'been', 'much', 'criticized', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'dizzying', 'experience', 'movie', 'theater', 'confines', 'big', 'screen', 'TV', 'bring', 'viewer', 'right', 'action', 'Granted', 'quick', 'editing', 'shaky', 'camera', 'work', 'make', 'few', 'fight', 'scenes', 'claustrophobic', 'confusing', 'be', 'desired', 'effect', 'are', 'handful', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'much', 'lower', 'video', 'quality', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'much', 'plot', 'are', 'also', 'strung', 'together', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'select', 'individual', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'director', 'comment', 'track', 'other', 'production', 'segments', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'director', 'commentary', 'examined', 'other', 'documentaries', 'yet', 'One', 'nitpick', 'DVD', 'Universal', 'decision', 'add', 'unskippable', 'advertising', 'beginning', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'press', 'menu', 'escape', 'one', 'forced', 'fast', 'forward', 'useless', 'ads.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

853280,A3S98L5B1SR9P1,B0002ZDVEU,Zack H.,"[9, 13]","This was nothing compared to the first film (The Bourne Identity). All we see are 108 minutes of Jason Bourne running around Germany. There's only about 15 minutes of action, and it's at the end of the film. We also do not learn anything about him, except that he killed two people. Also, is it just me, or was the camerawork in this film annoying? The cameraman needs to be fired. I could not follow any scenes with even remote action. It seemed as though they were trying to fit every angle into every shot. The camerawork was so damn bad, that you couldn't follow the story, which is probably how I wound up with my conclusion that hardly anything happens. However, from what I seen (yes, I did pay attention to the film), hardly ANYTHING happened. This film has the worst cinematography I've EVER seen (and that's saying ALOT), and this film is one of the most PLOTLESS films I've ever seen.The first film outshines this one by a mile.I also relied on what the critics said when I rented this, but after viewing it, I regret doing so.The camera work in this movie is enough to give you motion sickness. This is a 108 minute movie based on a very short plot. The filming will leave you with a headache as the camera is constantly shaking as if you were running with the characters or riding in a car on a very bumpy road. I could not enjoy the story because the camera work was so bad that it distracted from the movie. I don't know how the movie has received such a high rating. With the camera jumping around so much it was visually distracting so much that you can not enjoy it. I have the first one on DVD but I will not buy this one.They should've used a SteadyCam.The cinematography gives a new meaning to ""Sh-Sh-Shake it like a Polaroid picture!"" (HAHAHA. Okay, yeah, that was bad.)Okay, I know you're saying ""ENOUGH ABOUT THE CAMERAWORK!"".Julia Stiles was great for the screen time she was given. There was only one good ""thrilling"" scene, which is:*SPOILER ALERT*When he's going to snipe the woman who is after him while talking to her on the cell phone.In Supremacy, Jason Bourne seemed to me to be weak, not at smart as he was in the first. It was like he had lost his edge. He wasn't spouting random information, like in Identity. He only REALLY used his lightening fast fighting skills 2 times. And once, that was with a guy who had his hands together. And it still took Jason about 4 minutes to beat the guy. For a while, the handcuffed guy was beating Jason! Had it been in Identity, Jason would've kicked his butt in 5 seconds.This film was a disappointment.",1,Yikes. *SPOILERS*,1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,2577,"['was', 'nothing', 'compared', 'first', 'film', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'see', 'are', '108', 'minutes', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'running', 'around', 'Germany', 'only', 'about', '15', 'minutes', 'action', 'end', 'film', 'also', 'do', 'not', 'learn', 'anything', 'killed', 'two', 'people', 'Also', 'just', 'was', 'camerawork', 'film', 'annoying', 'cameraman', 'be', 'fired', 'could', 'not', 'follow', 'scenes', 'even', 'remote', 'action', 'seemed', 'were', 'trying', 'fit', 'angle', 'shot', 'camerawork', 'was', 'so', 'damn', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'follow', 'story', 'probably', 'how', 'wound', 'up', 'conclusion', 'hardly', 'anything', 'However', 'what', 'seen', 'yes', 'did', 'pay', 'attention', 'film', 'hardly', 'ANYTHING', 'happened', 'film', 'worst', 'cinematography', ""'ve"", 'EVER', 'seen', 'saying', 'ALOT', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'PLOTLESS', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.The', 'first', 'film', 'outshines', 'one', 'mile.I', 'also', 'relied', 'what', 'critics', 'said', 'when', 'rented', 'viewing', 'regret', 'doing', 'so.The', 'camera', 'work', 'movie', 'enough', 'give', 'motion', 'sickness', '108', 'minute', 'movie', 'based', 'very', 'short', 'plot', 'filming', 'will', 'leave', 'headache', 'camera', 'constantly', 'shaking', 'were', 'running', 'characters', 'riding', 'car', 'very', 'bumpy', 'road', 'could', 'not', 'enjoy', 'story', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'distracted', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'received', 'high', 'rating', 'camera', 'jumping', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'visually', 'distracting', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'not', 'enjoy', 'have', 'first', 'one', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'buy', 'one.They', 'should', ""'ve"", 'used', 'SteadyCam.The', 'cinematography', 'new', 'meaning', 'Sh-Sh-Shake', 'Polaroid', 'picture', 'HAHAHA', 'Okay', 'yeah', 'was', 'bad', 'Okay', 'know', ""'re"", 'saying', 'ENOUGH', 'THE', 'CAMERAWORK', '.Julia', 'Stiles', 'was', 'great', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'given', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'good', 'thrilling', 'scene', '*SPOILER', 'ALERT*When', 'going', 'snipe', 'woman', 'who', 'talking', 'cell', 'phone.In', 'Supremacy', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'seemed', 'be', 'weak', 'not', 'smart', 'was', 'first', 'was', 'had', 'lost', 'edge', 'was', ""n't"", 'spouting', 'random', 'information', 'Identity', 'only', 'REALLY', 'used', 'lightening', 'fast', 'fighting', 'skills', '2', 'times', 'once', 'was', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'hands', 'together', 'still', 'took', 'Jason', '4', 'minutes', 'beat', 'guy', 'while', 'handcuffed', 'guy', 'was', 'beating', 'Jason', 'Had', 'been', 'Identity', 'Jason', 'would', ""'ve"", 'kicked', 'butt', '5', 'seconds.This', 'film', 'was', 'disappointment']",N/A

If you already own an upconverting DVD player, you probably won't notice much difference in the picture quality.  Some of the Special Features on the HD DVD are pretty interesting, including features on the car chase in Moscow and the explosion at the house in Berlin.  On the other hand, the director's commentary is absolutely awful.  He does nothing but tell you what's going on in the movie and what he believes are the characters' motivations.  He says virtually nothing about the actual making of the movie.  I was extremely disappointed.
