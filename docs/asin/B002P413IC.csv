I gave it 3 stars, it is worth a rental. I just thought it would be better. I think that maybe Katherine Heigl just wasn't right in her role as Abby. That is probably what I think is just a little off. Gerard fit in his role as Mike Chadway, host of The Ugly Truth, a cable access show that gets picked up as a segment on the morning program in which Abby produces.

This is one of those romantic comedies that has some things that are outrageous and some things that are so cliche you almost want to groan. This will never be considered a classic movie, but it is watchable and in spite of a lack of chemistry between the two main characters, in the end, the romantic resolution isn't too bad. Of course this movie is another example of a girl who turns down Mr. perfect in order to be with the crass guy who she spends most of the movie hating, but I guess that's typical for this type of movie.The basic premise of the movie is that a TV producer's show is down in the ratings and so the studio brings in a crass, controversial but popular local cable figure who makes his name giving the ""ugly truth"" about relationships. At first there is the expected conflict between the two, but it starts to become a friendship fairly quickly as he helps her get her ideal guy. I won't spoil the ending by saying more, but suffice it to say, the movie follows a typical romantic movie plot.I suppose this movie could be popular among certain demographic segments that like raunchy references in their romantic comedies, but most people will probably find the movie somewhat forgettable.

They will never be good films and yet they can at least strive to be mindlessly entertaining and likable.  Sadly, `The Ugly Truth' as a film doesn't quite get any of that right.  It is predictably formulaic and you know before settling in that these complete opposites will butt-heads and then fall head over heels in love because, well, opposites attract.  We walk in completely understanding this fact and we're obviously OK with that because we are watching the movie.  We see Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl get top billing and so we understand that the talent pool is shallow and we must come to terms with the fact that this is going to be a film where marginally talented `stars' spar off one another for laughs.Here's the thing; `The Ugly Truth' is only a tiny bit funny, and it does absolutely nothing to legitimize its R rating.  I'm sorry, but if you are going to tone down your approach so as to sugar coat and basically serve us up another Matthew McConaughey rom-com then you might as well ditch the R rating and give us what you really want to give us.  Coloring your movie with redundant sexual puns and some foul language doesn't make you edgy or `ugly' enough.This was just misleading and ill-executed.Heigl is desperately trying to be Sandra Bullock and she's failing miserably at it.  She plays the same `independent man-hater' in every film, kind of like how Bullock consistently plays the ugly duckling turned swan in all her roles, and yet she just comes off unflattering and boring every time.  Butler is just a stereotype and basically only has his undeniable good looks (seriously, one of the most handsome men alive) and his accent.  There was a time when I had high hopes for Butler has an actor, but the years have only proven him incapable of really acting (although `Coriolanus' was a step in the right direction).A big issue that I have with this film is that it is embarrassingly shallow.  The way that it paints men and women is ridiculous and completely falsified and yet it never really works to show the kinks.  It basically goes out of its way to paint all men as pigs and all women as stuck up and stuck in fantasy.  The way that the cutesy story follows Butler reinventing Heigl is also so `high school' I just wanted to puke.  Nothing here devotes any sort of effort into even TRYING to be something more than it is.  It's perfectly fine with doing what every other teen comedy has done before.And that, my friends, is the ugly truth.",1,There's a bird in my dressing room...,1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2012,2535,"['Movies', 'Ugly', 'Truth', 'serve', 'particular', 'purpose', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'good', 'films', 'yet', 'can', 'least', 'strive', 'be', 'mindlessly', 'entertaining', 'likable', 'Sadly', 'Ugly', 'Truth', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'right', 'predictably', 'formulaic', 'know', 'settling', 'complete', 'opposites', 'will', 'butt-heads', 'then', 'fall', 'head', 'heels', 'love', 'well', 'attract', 'walk', 'completely', 'understanding', 'fact', ""'re"", 'obviously', 'OK', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'see', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'get', 'top', 'billing', 'so', 'understand', 'talent', 'pool', 'shallow', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'fact', 'going', 'be', 'film', 'where', 'marginally', 'talented', 'stars', 'spar', 'one', 'thing', 'Ugly', 'Truth', 'only', 'tiny', 'bit', 'funny', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'legitimize', 'R', 'rating', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'are', 'going', 'tone', 'down', 'approach', 'so', 'sugar', 'coat', 'basically', 'serve', 'up', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'rom-com', 'then', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'ditch', 'R', 'rating', 'give', 'really', 'want', 'give', 'Coloring', 'movie', 'redundant', 'sexual', 'puns', 'foul', 'language', ""n't"", 'make', 'edgy', 'ugly', 'enough.This', 'was', 'just', 'misleading', 'ill-executed.Heigl', 'desperately', 'trying', 'be', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'failing', 'miserably', 'same', 'independent', 'man-hater', 'film', 'kind', 'how', 'Bullock', 'consistently', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'turned', 'swan', 'roles', 'yet', 'just', 'off', 'unflattering', 'boring', 'time', 'Butler', 'just', 'stereotype', 'basically', 'only', 'undeniable', 'good', 'looks', 'seriously', 'one', 'most', 'handsome', 'men', 'alive', 'accent', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'Butler', 'actor', 'years', 'have', 'only', 'proven', 'incapable', 'really', 'acting', 'Coriolanus', 'was', 'step', 'right', 'direction', 'big', 'issue', 'have', 'film', 'embarrassingly', 'shallow', 'way', 'men', 'women', 'ridiculous', 'completely', 'falsified', 'yet', 'never', 'really', 'show', 'kinks', 'basically', 'way', 'paint', 'men', 'pigs', 'women', 'stuck', 'up', 'stuck', 'fantasy', 'way', 'cutesy', 'story', 'Butler', 'reinventing', 'Heigl', 'also', 'so', 'high', 'school', 'just', 'wanted', 'puke', 'Nothing', 'here', 'sort', 'effort', 'even', 'TRYING', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'doing', 'what', 'other', 'teen', 'comedy', 'done', 'before.And', 'friends', 'ugly', 'truth']",N/A

Maybe there's a quota they have to make??Anyway, it was okay.

Critics are being very unkind to it and it is ending up on many lists of the worst movies of the year.  This really dumfounds me.  Out of all the movies out there and all the trash that exists this movie is being picked out as a target.  Don't listen to any of them.  This sweet, fun comedy is a twist on your standard romantic comedy and is a laugh riot.  When I started watching it I thought it was a little crass but I quickly got over that.  I was thrilled.  A comedy that didn't follow the traditional formula.  I found the plot inventive and pretty realistic.  Yes, our main character played by Katherine Heigl is beautiful, single and looking for love.  But she is looking for Mr. Right and not seeing men for who they really are.  She is obsessive, compulsive and definitely speaks her mind.  Then we have Gerard Butler who plays a crude man's man with a local cable show who gets a spot on the morning show she produces.  He thinks women are looking for fantasies, phony and don't get men at all.  And guess what, he speaks his mind as well.  The chemistry between Heigl and Butler is hot and steamy from the beginning.  Even their true dislike of each other burns up the screen.  The way their friendship develops is very believable as he helps her get a man and this film is definitely a twist as he teaches her how to change her ways and why.  The sexes are reversed here and I found myself agreeing with a lot of it and laughing hysterically at most of it.  The ending was a great pay off and as I said whatever flaws this film has, the chemistry with Heigl and Butler makes up for any of them.Is this film an intellectual look at relationships that is going to change life as we know it?  Is it a film that will change how films and comedies are done for the rest of time?  Of course not.  This is a highly enjoyable romantic comedy that is inventive over the generic norm and definitely worth your time.  And the blu ray version is exsquisite.  Colors are vibrant  and the clarity is amazing.  I love it when the enhancement of blu ray makes even a comedy film levels above its dvd counterpart.  So I say look beyond the negative vibe this film is getting.  It is very undeserved.

1282257,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002P413IC,Chris Pandolfi,"[106, 118]","""The Ugly Truth"" represents something I never thought I'd see: A romantic comedy that both women and men will appreciate. Granted, it probably won't be for the same reasons. Women will like it because underneath it all, it's a fairly typical romantic comedy, the story of Girl Hates Boy, Boy Hates Girl, Boy and Girl Fall in Love Anyway. Men will like it because one of the main characters expresses much of what they think and feel on a daily basis. Everyone will like it because the story is engaging and the characters are not mere cardboard caricatures. You can actually invest in them, and you're able to care about what's going on. What could easily have been a routine date night movie is instead a surprisingly good movie that need not wait until date night. It's also genuinely funny--a bit raunchy, yes, but funny just the same.Much of the film's success is due to the wonderful onscreen chemistry between Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler. They continuously make us laugh, yet the comedy is not so broad that you can't believe them in their roles. They make a point of interacting with one another, not as comic relief but as real people. Heigl plays Abby Richter, the romantically challenged, neurotic, controlling producer of a failing Sacramento morning talk show. Butler plays Mike Chadaway, the chauvinistic host of a public access relationship program called ""The Ugly Truth."" He's unapologetically tell-it-like-it-is in matters of men and women. There's no such thing, he claims, as a sensitive, nurturing man who wants to connect at an emotional level. Men just want sex, plain and simple. And they only want it with attractive women.Abby, who thinks Mike's rhetoric is appalling, is horrified when she learns that he has been hired to her station in an effort to boost ratings. They clash at every turn ... until he learns that she's interested in dating her next door neighbor--an orthopedic surgeon named Colin (Eric Winter) who just happens to be incredibly handsome. Sensing she's doing everything wrong to initiate a relationship, Mike offers to help Abby by having her test his relationships theories on Colin. She reluctantly agrees, and sure enough, Mike's methods work wonders. She dresses more provocatively. She learns to stop being critical and avoid discussing her personal problems. She learns to be the embodiment of both the saint and the sinner, or as Mike puts it, ""The librarian and the stripper.""And that's when things start to get more complex. Abby is succeeding with Colin, but only at the expense of not being herself. On the other hand, could anyone love her as herself? She is, after all, known for bringing background checks and printed topics of conversation to blind dates. As for Mike, he has very definite reasons for believing that loving relationships are a sham. They're gradually revealed not only through carefully structured scenes, but also through Butler, who shows he can find the right balance between smug and sensitive. We see that Mike is the closest thing his young nephew has for a father, and even though he playfully gives the boy relationship advice, he's also quick to remind him that kids should never, ever watch his show.Heigl also manages a balancing act with her performance, specifically between strength and vulnerability. Abby overachieves at work to compensate for a lack of a love life, which initially seems funny but steadily grows desperate. For reasons she doesn't care to admit to, she's falling in love with Mike, and he too is falling in love with her. But what about Colin? Is he with Abby only because of the faade Mike told her to put up? There's a scene between her and Colin late in the film that directly addresses this issue, and to my delight, it's handled in a way that avoids just about everything that would happen in the average romantic comedy. There are no shouting matches. There are no flying fists. There are no confrontations. There's only a quiet moment of realization that the truth is indeed ugly.Scenes like these are wonderfully juxtaposed with moments of well written comedy. There are some very amusing moments between Cheryl Hines and John Michael Higgins as unhappily married news anchors who share the same desk and time slot. The film's single funniest scene takes place in a restaurant and involves Abby, an extremely stimulating pair of underwear, and a control device that ends up in the wrong hands.I can say with complete honesty (and some embarrassment) that I wasn't expecting such a strong film. I certainly wasn't expecting a strong film belonging to this particular genre. What floors me is that two of the three writers of this film are Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith. There are the same two that brought us ""The House Bunny,"" one of the worst films of 2008. They certainly got it right this time around. ""The Ugly Truth"" is one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time, a delightful and absorbing tale about the fronts people display. It's funny without lowering itself to the level of cheap gags, and this is in spite of the film's well-deserved R rating. Heigl and Butler convincingly pull off a romance, no small feat given the contrived nature of these kinds of films.

Schneider,"[1, 2]","This movie is definitely an acquired taste....not for everyone, not for the easily offended, or for those that are extremely serious about being politically correct.  It's a movie you will either really like, or not like at all.  I imagine that some people watched the first 15 minutes, said to themselves, ""Mike is a misogynistic pig"" and turned it off.  Is he?  Well, yes.  Is what he says shocking and disturbing?  That would be a big yes again.  I happen to give it a bit more time though before I decided.  So, here is the premise, he is the star of a cable show that deals with the the sexes, and he is upfront, in your face and very un pc.  Our other character, Abby is a super uptight tv producer who's station is looking for the one show to make them a hit and bring in ratings.  I'm sure you see where we are going with this....The night before they meet, Abby is home alone and her cat steps on the remote and his show comes on.  She is irritated and indignant and can't stand this guy, so she calls the station and they do a little verbal sparring before he hangs up on her.  Tomorrow morning, the boss introduces their newest star...you guessed it....he's baaaack.She is stuck with him and though he completely repulses her she begins to pick his brain about what guys really like and how she can get the new doctor next door to fall for her.  Mike then becomes her coach in getting Abby hooked up, not ever seeing that he is starting to fall for her too.There were several laugh out loud funny parts in the movie and as the movie progresses Mike becomes more soft and lovable and you see that in his home life he is anything but the brutish neanderthal he portrays, and soon Abby sees it too.I liked it.  It was different, I thought the two characters worked well together and it had a fun vibe to it.Again though, not for everyone, and if you are easily offended, don't watch this one.  It will probably not be for you.For the rest of us, enjoy a funny, romantic comedy with a little edge.",4,"not for the easily offended or ""super-pc"" set.....for the rest us, read on...",1267228800,"02 27, 2010",2010,2004,"['movie', 'definitely', 'acquired', 'taste', '.not', 'everyone', 'not', 'easily', 'offended', 'are', 'extremely', 'serious', 'being', 'politically', 'correct', 'movie', 'will', 'either', 'really', 'like', 'not', 'imagine', 'people', 'watched', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'said', 'Mike', 'misogynistic', 'pig', 'turned', 'off', 'Well', 'yes', 'what', 'shocking', 'disturbing', 'would', 'be', 'big', 'yes', 'again', 'happen', 'give', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'decided', 'So', 'here', 'premise', 'star', 'cable', 'show', 'deals', 'sexes', 'upfront', 'face', 'very', 'un', 'pc', 'other', 'character', 'Abby', 'super', 'uptight', 'tv', 'producer', 'who', 'station', 'looking', 'one', 'show', 'make', 'hit', 'bring', 'ratings', ""'m"", 'sure', 'see', 'where', 'are', 'going', '.The', 'night', 'meet', 'Abby', 'home', 'alone', 'cat', 'steps', 'remote', 'show', 'irritated', 'indignant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'guy', 'station', 'do', 'little', 'verbal', 'sparring', 'up', 'Tomorrow', 'morning', 'boss', 'newest', 'star', 'guessed', 'baaaack.She', 'stuck', 'completely', 'pick', 'brain', 'what', 'guys', 'really', 'like', 'how', 'can', 'get', 'new', 'doctor', 'next', 'door', 'fall', 'Mike', 'then', 'coach', 'getting', 'Abby', 'hooked', 'up', 'not', 'ever', 'seeing', 'starting', 'fall', 'were', 'several', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'parts', 'movie', 'movie', 'Mike', 'more', 'soft', 'lovable', 'see', 'home', 'life', 'anything', 'brutish', 'neanderthal', 'soon', 'Abby', 'liked', 'was', 'different', 'thought', 'two', 'characters', 'worked', 'well', 'together', 'had', 'fun', 'vibe', 'it.Again', 'not', 'everyone', 'are', 'easily', 'offended', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'one', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'rest', 'enjoy', 'funny', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'little', 'edge']",N/A

Goins, Cheryl Hines and Noah MatthewsWRITTEN BY: Nicole Eastman, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kristen SmithDIRECTED BY: Robert LuketicRated: RGenre: Romantic ComedyRelease Date: 24 July 2009I think Hollywood may be in trouble. While it is no need of good solid actors, it is in desperate need of new ideas. The plot and several of its scenes cause The Ugly Truth, to sadly fall victim to un-original repetitiveness as well; but its Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl that keep it from being horrible, and make it a fun film.If you don't believe me that there is an incredible shortage of original ideas out there, just take a look at some of the biggest movies of the year. Terminator Salvation, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Fast & Furious, Star Trek, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, among several others are sequels, spin-offs re-boots or remakes of some previous idea. I'm not saying they are bad movies, I'm simply saying they aren't original ideas.There are a ton more that are either based on someone's life, retold from a best-selling novel or some other work of previously written material. Precious, Up in the Air, Surrogates, Whiteout and Whip It, are all examples of such. Again, not terrible movies; just brought forth from someone else's idea.While The Ugly Truth is not any of these, it is an idea that's been recycled countless times; boy meets girl, they hate each other, something forces them to be around each other, they begin to fall for one another, one of them inevitably screws everything up, and then they get back together and live happily ever after. In the middle of all of that you will have several moments that make us laugh, but don't realistically happen on your average day. Take Gabby hanging upside down from the tree when she meets her dream-guy for example. Come on.Again however, because of the enduring on-screen chemistry between these two talented people (Butler and Heigl), we are willing to forgive a lot during the course of the film.Gerard Butler is an absolute delight and continues to show his vast range as an actor, with his character Mike Chadway. Mike is an absolute dog, who tells it like it is on his popular late night television show `The Ugly Truth.'Katherine Heigl plays Abby Richter; a television producer who's network is looking for a new cutting edge. Think that edge might be Mike's outlandish show? You know it is, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.The two first have an interaction over the phone, while Mike is taking live calls on the air. Abby is absurdly offended by his off-color remarks that hit home for her, like salt in an open wound. Mike senses this and enjoys very much, shutting her down.They are placed together when Abby's network picks up the show. Mike can read her like a book. He can see that she is controlling and overly needy and in desperate need of a good time. So, he makes a wager with her.If he can help her hook up with her hot new neighbor who just happens to be a doctor, then she will have to work with him. If he can't - he will walk from the show and leave her alone. The game is on. Mike takes Abby under his wing and begins to teach her everything she never knew about men.Although it's predictable a lot of the time, it contains several laughs and fun moments. My favorite of which is when Abby tries to defend herself by asking, ""What's wrong with comfort and efficiency?"" and Mike's response is, ""Well nothing, except no-one wants to f*** it."" It's nice to see there can be some adult humor in a romantic comedy, which is rare.I particularly enjoyed the third act. We get slapped in the face with the theme of the movie, but it feels good. And it was original and not over the top, which I liked. From the hotel scenes on, the movie got a lot better and was far more believable than what we saw in the first two thirds of the film.A lot of people have enjoyed a scene where Abby by chance, wears some panties given to her by Mike, to a work dinner. The panties happen to be lined with a special remote activated `toy'. The remote of course, lands in the hand of a curious child sitting across from her that takes almost as much pleasure as Mike does, in watching her squeal with pleasure.While that scene did put a smile on my face, it was too slap-stick to be truly enjoyable. The film would have been better had they made the humor more believable. Meg Ryan's impression of an orgasm in a public place in When Harry Met Sally, seems like the best served example of such.",3,The Ugly Truth Review,1266192000,"02 15, 2010",2010,4575,"['UGLY', 'TRUTHSTARRING', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Bree', 'Turner', 'Eric', 'Winter', 'Nick', 'Searcy', 'Jess', 'D.', 'Goins', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'Noah', 'MatthewsWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Nicole', 'Eastman', 'Karen', 'McCullah', 'Lutz', 'Kristen', 'SmithDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Robert', 'LuketicRated', 'RGenre', 'Romantic', 'ComedyRelease', 'Date', '24', 'July', '2009I', 'think', 'Hollywood', 'may', 'be', 'trouble', 'need', 'good', 'solid', 'actors', 'desperate', 'need', 'new', 'ideas', 'plot', 'several', 'scenes', 'cause', 'Ugly', 'Truth', 'sadly', 'fall', 'victim', 'un-original', 'repetitiveness', 'well', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'keep', 'being', 'horrible', 'make', 'fun', 'film.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'incredible', 'shortage', 'original', 'ideas', 'there', 'just', 'take', 'look', 'biggest', 'movies', 'year', 'Terminator', 'Salvation', 'Transformers', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'Star', 'Trek', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'several', 'others', 'are', 'sequels', 'spin-offs', 're-boots', 'remakes', 'previous', 'idea', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'are', 'bad', 'movies', ""'m"", 'simply', 'saying', 'are', ""n't"", 'original', 'ideas.There', 'are', 'ton', 'more', 'are', 'based', 'someone', 'life', 'retold', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'other', 'work', 'previously', 'written', 'material', 'Precious', 'Up', 'Air', 'Surrogates', 'Whiteout', 'Whip', 'are', 'examples', 'such', 'Again', 'not', 'terrible', 'movies', 'just', 'brought', 'forth', 'someone', 'else', 'idea.While', 'Ugly', 'Truth', 'not', 'idea', 'been', 'recycled', 'countless', 'times', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'hate', 'other', 'something', 'forces', 'be', 'other', 'begin', 'fall', 'one', 'one', 'inevitably', 'screws', 'everything', 'up', 'then', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'middle', 'will', 'have', 'several', 'moments', 'make', 'do', ""n't"", 'realistically', 'happen', 'average', 'day', 'Take', 'Gabby', 'hanging', 'upside', 'down', 'tree', 'when', 'dream-guy', 'example', 'Come', 'on.Again', 'however', 'enduring', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'two', 'talented', 'people', 'Butler', 'Heigl', 'are', 'willing', 'forgive', 'lot', 'course', 'film.Gerard', 'Butler', 'absolute', 'delight', 'show', 'vast', 'range', 'actor', 'character', 'Mike', 'Chadway', 'Mike', 'absolute', 'dog', 'who', 'popular', 'late', 'night', 'television', 'show', 'Ugly', 'Truth', ""'Katherine"", 'Heigl', 'Abby', 'Richter', 'television', 'producer', 'who', 'network', 'looking', 'new', 'cutting', 'edge', 'Think', 'edge', 'might', 'be', 'Mike', 'outlandish', 'show', 'know', 'let', 'not', 'get', 'ahead', 'ourselves.The', 'two', 'first', 'have', 'interaction', 'phone', 'Mike', 'taking', 'live', 'calls', 'air', 'Abby', 'absurdly', 'offended', 'off-color', 'remarks', 'hit', 'home', 'salt', 'open', 'wound', 'Mike', 'very', 'much', 'shutting', 'down.They', 'are', 'placed', 'together', 'when', 'Abby', 'network', 'up', 'show', 'Mike', 'can', 'read', 'book', 'can', 'see', 'controlling', 'overly', 'needy', 'desperate', 'need', 'good', 'time', 'So', 'wager', 'her.If', 'can', 'help', 'hook', 'up', 'hot', 'new', 'neighbor', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'doctor', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'will', 'walk', 'show', 'leave', 'alone', 'game', 'Mike', 'Abby', 'wing', 'teach', 'everything', 'never', 'knew', 'predictable', 'lot', 'time', 'several', 'laughs', 'fun', 'moments', 'favorite', 'when', 'Abby', 'defend', 'asking', 'What', 'wrong', 'comfort', 'efficiency', 'Mike', 'response', 'Well', 'nothing', 'no-one', 'f***', 'nice', 'see', 'can', 'be', 'adult', 'humor', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'rare.I', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'third', 'act', 'get', 'slapped', 'face', 'theme', 'movie', 'good', 'was', 'original', 'not', 'top', 'liked', 'hotel', 'scenes', 'movie', 'got', 'lot', 'better', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'believable', 'what', 'saw', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'film.A', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'scene', 'where', 'Abby', 'chance', 'panties', 'given', 'Mike', 'work', 'dinner', 'panties', 'happen', 'be', 'lined', 'special', 'remote', 'activated', 'toy', 'remote', 'course', 'hand', 'curious', 'child', 'sitting', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'pleasure', 'Mike', 'watching', 'squeal', 'pleasure.While', 'scene', 'did', 'put', 'smile', 'face', 'was', 'too', 'slap-stick', 'be', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'made', 'humor', 'more', 'believable', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'impression', 'orgasm', 'public', 'place', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'best', 'served', 'example', 'such']",N/A

He builds a case for what he wants to see (normally shoot em up movies, sci fi thrillers, dumb guy comedy or ones with gratuitous sex scenes) and I build a case for those I like to watch (romantic comedies, intense dramas, or epic sagas ...what can I say I'm a girl).  There are a few genres we both enjoy but those don't truly fall under the ""date"" category.  Most of the time when we DO find a date movie to agree on we find it to be cheesy or one of us walks away liking it vastly more than the other.  This was the first romantic comedy that we both loved in equal measure.The plot is pretty basic -- Katherine Heigel's character is a high maintenance woman working as a producer for a network that desperately needs to be injected with more ratings with about the same intensity she needs a boyfriend.  He is an in your face shock jock with his own show that gives a humorous but one sided view of the dating game.  The two would never have occasion to meet (because they are opposites in every way) but her boss employs him as a way to get ratings back up.  She won't work him until he makes her a deal that he can coach her to get the man of her dreams.Both my husband and I found both of the characters great believable examples of some of the extremely different perceptions that happen between the two sexes.  The dialogue between the two characters is hysterical as well as being on point for the dymanic they're trying to portray in the movie.  They do create some highly improbable scenarios during the movie (which I don't want to give away for fear it will ruin the movie) but set it up just right to make it plausible.  The chemistry between these two was awesome and I would definately love to see them in more stuff together.What really makes this great for a date movie is the amount of ""guy"" and ""girl"" humor in there.  Every time Heigel spoke I slapped my husband on the shoulder and pointed and every time Butler gave a raunchy come back he laughed back in my face.  The movie blends them together so well and sends the message that it's somewhere in the middle of these two polar opposites that the true key to love is found.It was truly one of the most charming movies I've seen in a long time.",5,Hands down the best date movie ever,1266710400,"02 21, 2010",2010,2356,"[""'re"", 'debate', 'what', 'movie', 'see', 'significant', 'other', 'something', 'pleading', 'case', 'front', 'jury', 'case', 'what', 'see', 'normally', 'shoot', 'em', 'up', 'movies', 'sci', 'fi', 'thrillers', 'dumb', 'guy', 'comedy', 'ones', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'scenes', 'build', 'case', 'like', 'watch', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'intense', 'dramas', 'epic', 'sagas', 'what', 'can', 'say', ""'m"", 'girl', 'are', 'few', 'genres', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'truly', 'fall', 'date', 'category', 'Most', 'time', 'when', 'DO', 'find', 'date', 'movie', 'agree', 'find', 'be', 'cheesy', 'one', 'walks', 'away', 'liking', 'vastly', 'more', 'other', 'was', 'first', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'loved', 'equal', 'measure.The', 'plot', 'pretty', 'basic', 'Katherine', 'Heigel', 'character', 'high', 'maintenance', 'woman', 'working', 'producer', 'network', 'desperately', 'be', 'injected', 'more', 'ratings', 'same', 'intensity', 'boyfriend', 'face', 'shock', 'jock', 'own', 'show', 'humorous', 'one', 'sided', 'view', 'dating', 'game', 'two', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'occasion', 'meet', 'are', 'opposites', 'way', 'boss', 'way', 'get', 'ratings', 'back', 'up', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'deal', 'can', 'coach', 'get', 'man', 'dreams.Both', 'husband', 'found', 'characters', 'great', 'believable', 'examples', 'extremely', 'different', 'perceptions', 'happen', 'two', 'sexes', 'dialogue', 'two', 'characters', 'hysterical', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'point', 'dymanic', ""'re"", 'trying', 'portray', 'movie', 'do', 'create', 'highly', 'improbable', 'scenarios', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'fear', 'will', 'ruin', 'movie', 'set', 'up', 'just', 'right', 'make', 'plausible', 'chemistry', 'two', 'was', 'awesome', 'would', 'definately', 'love', 'see', 'more', 'stuff', 'really', 'great', 'date', 'movie', 'amount', 'guy', 'girl', 'humor', 'there', 'time', 'Heigel', 'spoke', 'slapped', 'husband', 'shoulder', 'pointed', 'time', 'Butler', 'gave', 'raunchy', 'come', 'back', 'laughed', 'back', 'face', 'movie', 'together', 'so', 'well', 'message', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'two', 'polar', 'opposites', 'true', 'key', 'love', 'found.It', 'was', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'charming', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time']",N/A

Not one shred of insight whatsoever rendering the  attempts at comedy to be lame and pointless. The script was an absolute mess. Butler's character, for instance wins a spot on a struggling morning news show and presents us with wonderful revelations  of the male psyche, such as: a male would rather pass on a candlelight dinner and instead spend the evening watching women wrestle in jello. In order for this bit to be funny, the script needs a unique angle or a bit of insight to accompany it.  Insight was something completely lost on the writers here. Even crude humor needs insight. Without it, you are relying solely on shock value, but nothing in this film was shocking in the least. And Butler's character with a radio wire so he could communicate with his protege while she was on her date? A blatant rip-off of Roxanne, only Roxanne was in the hands of a far better script.

1282269,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002P413IC,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 6]","The romantic sex comedy ""The Ugly Truth"" was a Summer hit and became actress Katherine Heigl's (""Grey's Anatomy"", ""27 Dresses"", ""Knocked Up"") latest film to become a box office hit earning over $193 million worldwide.""The Ugly Truth"" is directed by Robert Luketic (""21"", ""Legally Blonde"") and featured a screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz (""10 Things I Hate About You"" TV series, ""The House Bunny"", ""Legally Blonde"") and Kirsten Smith (""The House Bunny"", ""Legally Blonde"", ""Ella Enchanted"").  The film features music by composer Aaron Zigman (""The Proposal"", ""My Sister's Keeper"", ""Madea Goes to Jail"") and cinematographer Russell Carpenter (""21"", ""Titanic"", ""Charlie's Angels"" films).The film revolves around a Sacramento-based morning show that is being slaughtered in the ratings.  Producer Abby Richter (played by Katherine Heigl) feels that she is doing a very good at her job but with ratings slipping, her job is on the line.Meanwhile, her love life is not exactly going that great.  Having really no major experience with men, she has been trying online dating sites to no avail.  Frustrated by her date, when she returns home, her pet cat accidentally hits a remote control and the channel is changed to ""The Ugly Truth"", a show hosted by Mike Chadway (played by Gerard Butler, ""300"", ""The Phantom of the Opera"", ""Beowulf and Grendel"").Mike is popular for his love advice that he gives to men and women and how they can easily get laid.  His advice turns Abby off and prompts her to call him and tell her that he is wrong which leads to Mike telling her that she can't get laid because she's ugly.When Abby goes to work the following day, she finds out from her boss that Mike has been hired by the morning show to bring his version of ""The Ugly Truth"" to their morning show to help bring up the ratings.On his first appearance, Mike tries to fix the tension my husband and wife hosts Larry (played by John Michael Higgins, ""Kath & Kim"", ""Raising the Bar"") and Georgia (played by Cheryl Hines, ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", ""In the Motherhood"") by telling them live on the show that they don't have great sex and they need to work on it because its evident that their tension is because of it.  And while the show is live, both husband and wife start making out.  The result of Mike's appearance is positive as the show earned higher ratings and better feedback from its viewers.Not so thrilled and somewhat repulsed by Mike, Abby knows that she has to be nice to him since he is responsible for the show's turnaround in the ratings.  But Mike knows that Abby is having problems in her love life and so, he decides to help her get a man by giving her advice.  From dressing sexy and not look so conservative but a woman that can get a guy in bed.Sure enough, the advice that Abby has received from Mike works.  But while Mike tries to give advice to her, he finds himself attracted to Abby.Will Mike continue to help Abby progress with her love life to another man or will he let her know his feelings towards her?VIDEO & AUDIO:""The Ugly Truth"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (aspect ration of 2:40:1) and for the most part, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment delivers with an impressive film which showcases clarity, vibrancy and plenty of detail.  The film has a fine layer of grain, blacks are well done but for the most part, as expected from a talented cinematographer such as Titanic's Russell Carpenter, ""The Ugly Truth"" is absolutely beautiful on High Definition.As for audio, the film is presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA (also, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and an English-Audio Description track).  ""The Ugly Truth"" sounds absolutely beautiful with its lossless track.  Dialogue and music is front and center channel but is for the most part crystal clear.  Also, a good presence of the surround channels with one scene featuring Thunder which reverberates through the soundscape, a baseball game with the ambiance of the crowd, a restaurant scene with buzzing vibration sounds to the ambiance in areas where there are people all around.  For the most part, surround usage is well done as you can hear the sounds all around you.But one thing that ""The Ugly Truth"" is known for is its use of modern music.  From Kate Perry's ""Hot n' Cold"", Flo Rida's ""Right Round"", Natasha Bedingfield's ""Pocketful of Sunshine"" and the Latin music by Los Pinguos, the music is crystal clear with a good amount of bass and sounds absolutely beautiful via the film's lossless soundtrack.Subtitles for ""The Ugly Truth"" are in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Ugly Truth"" special features are in High Definition, English (Stereo) and with Spanish, Portuguese subtitles* movieIQ - Watch the film with movieIQ which allows viewers to connect to the Internet to access real-time information on the cast, music and trivia.

How good the chemistry between both Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl had.* Previews - Featuring trailers for upcoming Sony Pictures Home Entertainment releases.* BD-Live enabled""The Ugly Truth"" Blu-ray release also includes a second disc which is the digital copy of the film.JUDGMENT CALL:The screenplay for ""The Ugly Truth"" is from the women who brought us ""Legally Blonde"", ""Ella Enchanted"" and ""The House Bunny"" and there latest film is possibly there most raunchiest film yet.  With ""The House Bunny"" showcasing a sexy but dumb blonde storyline, ""The Ugly Truth"" features an intelligent, beautiful blonde who seems to not know how to attract men.Needless to say, this romantic comedy is quite sexy but it depends on how one views the film.  I can see women who may feel angered that Abby,  a beautiful, intelligent woman has to listen to the potty-mouth, sexually charged character Mike on how to attract men.  Granted, if men were responsible for writing this screenplay, I'm sure the film would receive the wrath of some women but the fact is that the film was written by a woman, screenplay adapted by women and even Katherine Heigl executive produced this film.But assuming that you came to watch this film without the seriousness or politically correctness, then ""The Ugly Truth"" can be seen as a raunchy, sexually driven comedy.  Some scenes are either going to make you laugh or make you think the jokes are just stupid.  From Abby spilling a drink on her date's crotch and then trying to rub his pants with a napkin at a baseball game and attracting the attention of the people, let alone the camera crew  to Abby wearing panties with a vibrator that a scene is nearly reminiscent of the popular ""When Harry Met Sally"" scene.Personally for me, Katherine Heigl is way too sexy and beautiful of an actress that it's hard to believe that she can't find a date.  But I felt that Heigl did a solid job for the role of Abby.  As for Gerard Butler, he plays your typical chauvinistic male, potty-mouth, very blunt character that knows how to attract women and thus give advice to them and he also did a great job for the character.  Interesting chemistry that works onscreen and both wanted to be a raunchy Spencer & Tracy type of duo and for the most part, the two were quite fun to watch together.Needless to say, like how many critics felt about the film, how the audience will find this film will probably be the same.  Those who will find it funny and those who will find the film not to their liking.With that being said, the film's release on Blu-ray looks incredible and has a pretty solid lossless soundtrack for a romantic comedy.  It helps when you have popular, contemporary music featured in the film.Overall, ""The Ugly Truth"" is not the kind of romantic comedy ala ""Sleepless in Seattle"" or ""When Harry Met Sally"" but if you are looking for a romantic comedy that is sexually charged, then this film is for you.  For the most part, I found the film to be quite fun and I admit that I found certain scenes to be hilarious but I also admit that the film seemed a bit farfetched at times.  But personally, it's good to have a romantic comedy that is different once in awhile and in this case, a film that is pretty raunchy.  So, in some ways it was interesting to see how far the screenplay and the talent would go (via improvisation).If you are wanting a romantic comedy especially a film with raunchy humor, then definitely give ""The Ugly Truth"" a chance.",3,Blu-ray: A raunchy romantic comedy with a pretty good PQ and AQ.,1257811200,"11 10, 2009",2009,9697,"['romantic', 'sex', 'comedy', 'Ugly', 'Truth', 'was',

More unexpectedly is that the film works for both the men and women in the audience.  The heads of both sexes roll back with spontaneously barks of laughter while watching the chemically pleasant antics of the two stars, particularly the go-for-the-groin brutal one liners delivered by Butler as the quintessential loutish man's man conjured up straight from the scripts of Comedy Central'sMan Show - The Complete First Season (Vol. 1 & 2).Sure, the film uses stereotypes to fuel its humor.  Heigl and her sidekick assistant know there isn't much to life if it doesn't include a man.  Butler rolls around in a pool filled with cherry Jell-o with two bikini clad redheads--boy, is he happy!  Are feminists out there angry because men are hard-wired to appreciate attractive women?  Oh well. What about that great shot of Eric Winter's upper body as viewed from the tree outside his apartment? I liked that.  The film is funny whether or not it uses the usual Hollywood formula for the boy-meets-girl genre.Heigl's Abby depicts the typically efficient albeit tightly-wound girl executive--smart, attractive and crucially controlling.  Glowing in her efficiency, she humorously waxes clueless when it comes to attracting the opposite sex.  Plagued with a inner check list of desirable qualities that she fully expects to realize in one male, she flounders miserably in the dating world and instead viciously pursues her career as a morning show television producer with the zeal of a savvy attack dog.  Enter Butler's Mike, a late hour TV shock jock who has no problem letting all those pink-robed, cat-owning spinsters in television land in on what men really want in their women: a combination of librarian and stripper.  Unbeknownst to over-achiever Abby, her station has hired Mike to inflate flagging ratings and she must swallow her disgust and pride when she not only finds that she must work with him but that he may be correct in his theories as he tutors her in landing her dream man--Colin (Eric Winter), the luscious (and too convenient) boy-next -door.Sure, some of the scenes are over the top--in particular the view of Heigl upside down in a tree while rescuing her cat probably wouldn't happen in quite that way with quite the fortuitous timing--but they work; they make the audience laugh and shed their inhibitions for the duration of the film.  That's what comedy is all about--its funny whether its low or high brow.  In the same respect, the film's more serious scenes slow the pace down a bit, but this is to be expected.  The audience needs to catch their breath and get ready for the next giggle.Bottom line?  ""The Ugly Truth"" blends the yang perspective from ""The Hangover"" with the yin perspective of ""The Proposal"" to craft a funny film that will keep you laughing at the two leads and satisfied with more than just the popcorn.  Recommended, but not for children and not for those who have a problem with a cruder form of humor.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",4,"Its 2009, but Stereotypes Can Still Be Funny",1248393600,"07 24, 2009",2009,3370,"['Here', 'Friday', 'night', 'theatre', 'mostly', 'filled', 'clumps', 'girlfriends', 'see', 'movie', 'friends', 'Most', 'obviously', 'trailers', 'director', 'Robert', 'Luketic', '2009', 'film', 'Ugly', 'Truth', 'starring', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'do', 'more', 'hint', 'presentation', 'ultimate', 'chick', 'flick', 'surprise', '75', '%', 'audience', 'female', 'More', 'unexpectedly', 'film', 'men', 'women', 'audience', 'heads', 'sexes', 'roll', 'back', 'spontaneously', 'barks', 'laughter', 'watching', 'chemically', 'pleasant', 'antics', 'two', 'stars', 'particularly', 'go-for-the-groin', 'brutal', 'one', 'liners', 'delivered', 'Butler', 'quintessential', 'loutish', 'man', 'man', 'conjured', 'up', 'straight', 'scripts', 'Comedy', ""Central'sMan"", 'Show', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'Vol', '1', '2', '.Sure', 'film', 'stereotypes', 'fuel', 'humor', 'Heigl', 'sidekick', 'assistant', 'know', ""n't"", 'much', 'life', ""n't"", 'include', 'man', 'Butler', 'around', 'pool', 'filled', 'cherry', 'Jell-o', 'two', 'bikini', 'clad', 'redheads', 'boy', 'happy', 'Are', 'there', 'angry', 'men', 'are', 'hard-wired', 'appreciate', 'attractive', 'women', 'Oh', 'well', 'What', 'great', 'shot', 'Eric', 'Winter', 'upper', 'body', 'viewed', 'tree', 'apartment', 'liked', 'film', 'funny', 'not', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'formula', 'boy-meets-girl', 'genre.Heigl', 'Abby', 'typically', 'efficient', 'tightly-wound', 'girl', 'executive', 'smart', 'attractive', 'crucially', 'controlling', 'Glowing', 'efficiency', 'humorously', 'waxes', 'clueless', 'when', 'attracting', 'opposite', 'sex', 'Plagued', 'inner', 'check', 'list', 'desirable', 'qualities', 'fully', 'realize', 'one', 'male', 'miserably', 'dating', 'world', 'instead', 'viciously', 'career', 'morning', 'show', 'television', 'producer', 'zeal', 'savvy', 'attack', 'dog', 'Enter', 'Butler', 'Mike', 'late', 'hour', 'TV', 'shock', 'jock', 'who', 'problem', 'letting', 'pink-robed', 'cat-owning', 'spinsters', 'television', 'land', 'what', 'men', 'really', 'want', 'women', 'combination', 'librarian', 'stripper', 'Unbeknownst', 'over-achiever', 'Abby', 'station', 'hired', 'Mike', 'inflate', 'flagging', 'ratings', 'must', 'swallow', 'disgust', 'pride', 'when', 'not', 'only', 'must', 'work', 'may', 'be', 'correct', 'theories', 'landing', 'dream', 'man', 'Colin', 'Eric', 'Winter', 'luscious', 'too', 'convenient', 'boy-next', '-door.Sure', 'scenes', 'are', 'top', 'particular', 'view', 'Heigl', 'upside', 'down', 'tree', 'rescuing', 'cat', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'happen', 'quite', 'way', 'fortuitous', 'timing', 'work', 'make', 'audience', 'laugh', 'shed', 'inhibitions', 'duration', 'film', 'what', 'comedy', 'about', 'funny', 'low', 'high', 'brow', 'same', 'respect', 'film', 'more', 'serious', 'scenes', 'slow', 'pace', 'down', 'bit', 'be', 'expected', 'audience', 'catch', 'breath', 'get', 'ready', 'next', 'giggle.Bottom', 'line', 'Ugly', 'Truth', 'yang', 'perspective', 'Hangover', 'yin', 'perspective', 'Proposal', 'craft', 'funny', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing', 'two', 'leads', 'satisfied', 'more', 'just', 'popcorn', 'Recommended', 'not', 'children', 'not', 'who', 'have', 'problem', 'cruder', 'form', 'humor.Diana', 'Faillace', 'Von', 'Behren', 'reneofc']",N/A

1282275,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002P413IC,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 9]","This 2009 movie proves that women - in this case, screenwriters Nicole Eastman, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith - can write romantic comedies just as poorly as men can. As directed by Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde), the idea behind this misfire is to cross-pollinate the most tired conventions of the female-focused genre with the sensibilities of the recent spate of raunchy, man-boy comedies, this latter genre having found its unequivocal leader in Judd Apatow. However, unlike Apatow, who has figured out how to make films that are insightful as well as funny likeThe 40-Year-Old VirginandKnocked Up(ironically featuring this film's star, Katherine Heigl), Luketic shows no such finesse as everything in this film feels labored with the principal actors Heigl and Gerard Butler overplaying their opposites-attracts roles to near-cartoon proportions. Moreover, there are so many absurd gross-out gags inserted in this film that it feels like the creators (including executive producer Heigl) completely miscalculates who its target audience appears to be.The strictly by-the-numbers plot centers on Abby Richter, an uptight, overachieving producer for a ratings-challenged morning talk show in, of all places, Sacramento. Her workplace is full of the stock characters you would expect in this type of formulaic movie - the demanding station manager, the show's vainglorious co-hosts with empty smiles and non-ironic deliveries, the inane segments that make up Abby's struggling show. Predictably, her personal life is burdened by an incessant, programmatic search for Mr. Right, and consequently, her one-time dates become a series of qualification interviews. Prospects don't look much better at work with her show's ratings, and so enters local cable-access celebrity, Mike Chadway, a chauvinist personality who regales in providing sexist advice on what men are really looking for in women. Naturally, it comes down to guys wanting nothing but sex and how women should do everything they can to encourage it.Ratings rise based on the prurient content and Mike's unapologetic behavior, and even Abby recognizes his prowess in tapping into the public's psyche, so much so that on a stay-or-get-fired wager, Mike convinces her that he can be her Cyrano to help her land her neighbor, a handsome doctor who meets all of Abby's superficial qualifications. As tired as the premise sounds (and it is), the movie's pain points are exacerbated by the constant need to humiliate Abby, mainly through simulations of sexual acts in public. Obviously a knock-off of Meg Ryan's fake orgasm scene inWhen Harry Met Sally..., the most notoriously contrived episode involves a pair of electronic panties that cause her to writhe uncontrollably in front of her corporate sponsors. Heigl seems to be playing the same model of efficiency in all her big-screen roles, and as Abby, she plays her stereotype on hyper-drive, for instance, hanging upside down from a tree in her underwear or doing her happy dance repeatedly.Burying his Scottish brogue under an accent that sounds suspiciously like Mel Gibson's, Butler should be careful about accepting roles like Mike because he could turn into a Matthew McConaughey-type of actor, a promising career start (Dear Frankie) followed by bad commercially-driven choices. The other actors make little impression with even the comic talents of John Michael Higgins and Cheryl Hines wasted as the shallow talk show co-hosts. The ending is predictable and poorly matted on a hot-air balloon, and the denouement brings an unnecessarily cynical exclamation point to the whole venture. The 2009 DVD is unsurprisingly, mostly filler - a gag reel, a set of alternative endings, and a couple of featurettes - the first about the differences in the male and female points of view and the second about the apparent hilarity in making this film. I'm glad the cast and crew had a good time, me not so much.",2,Standard Rom-Com or Gross-Out Comedy?

My tolerance for Katherine Heigl is less developed, but they looked pretty darn cute in the TV spots, so I said what the heck.  I went to a screening with a 61-year-old friend, and we were both a bit embarassed by the escalating crudity of both the language and the gags.  In addition to the usual rom com Meet Cute sorts of situations, there's also lengthy dialogues about all forms of sexual contact, including masturbation.  In one episode that goes on way too long to be funny, Heigl's character is the recipient of shall we say, electronic pleasure while at a restaurant.  The concept had plenty of potential to be charming and funny, in the vein of a classic Cary Grant-Rosalind Russell battle-of-the-sexes comedies but sadly, this script lacks that sort of class and went for the lowest common denominator all the way.  Heigl can't seem to get away from sophomoric sex gags in her movie career, but here she carries on gamely.  As her foil, Butler (sporting stubble and an American accent) retains his gruff appeal, though I much prefer him clean-shaven and speaking in his native brogue.

1282292,A35FIQ83PE0E07,B002P413IC,Irikefe Okonedo,"[0, 0]","Romantic comedy in which Sacramento, California TV producer Abby Richter (played by Katherine Heigl) is most unhappy when her network hires boorish and misogynist former salesman Mike Chadway (played by Gerard Butler) to be the host of a new show to be aired on the network entitled `The Ugly Truth' in which he lays out the `ugly truth' about what men want from women: not personality and depth of character but looks, looks, looks and sex, sex, sex. Men are simple creatures and they don't want a deep emotional connection with a woman but merely a woman who looks gorgeous and with whom they can get laid easily and often. Abby is Mike's producer and is outraged at his opinions and views him as a sexist pig whose show will be the death of the network but when The Ugly Truth turns out to be a ratings winner she is forced to eat humble pie and accept that Mike is good for the network, even though the show goes against everything that she believes in. Abby thinks that Mike is an idiot who doesn't know anything about sex and relationships but when advice that he gives her enables her to get into a relationship with her handsome next-door neighbour and doctor Colin (played by Eric Winter) she realises that despite Mike's boorish ways he does seem to know what he is talking about when it comes to how a woman should attract a man. Despite having disliked Mike intensely initially she grows to like him somewhat (although she still holds that he is somewhat of a misogynist pig), especially when she finds out that he has a good relationship with his 10 or so year old nephew to whom he is a father figure. However when it transpires that a major TV network in New York is swooping to poach Mike from Abby's network because his show The Ugly Truth is just so good, Abby is sent by her boss to intercept him before he appears as a guest on talk show The Late Late Show and convince him to stay at their network for the sake of their ratings. Abby meets Mike at the hotel he is staying at and when she does it transpires that he has turned down the New York job offer so that he can stay in Sacramento and in his nephew's life, which pleases Abby as now she doesn't have to swallow her pride and try to convince him to stay at her network. But after an electrifying dance between the two of them on a dancefloor after Mike's interview Abby and Mike discover that the attraction between them that they have both been trying to deny for some time is just too strong to resist and they end up kissing in the hotel's elevator. Both embarassed by what has just happened Abby and Mike retreat to their respective hotel rooms. But the normally cocky and womanising Mike is falling for Abby and decides that he is not going to pretend that what happened in the elevator should not have happened and is instead going to admit to Abby his feelings for her. But when he gets to Abby's room, the boyfriend that he got her into a relationship with Colin has showed up to surprise her and answers the door, forcing Mike to lie and say that he showed up to tell Abby about changes to their flight arrangements. Mike leaves but Abby pursues him and catches up with him in the corridor as she wants to know what the kiss between them in the elevator meant: she is seemingly falling for him as well. But then the cocky and misogynist front that Mike usually portrays to women and to the world is revealed as existing because he has been hurt by women in the past and is afraid of getting his heart broken again. Mike then rejects Abby and denies that the kiss meant anything and that he wants to be with her and walks away. But Abby now knows that she wants to be with Mike and so splits up with Colin, citing as the reason that the version of herself that she had been presenting to him was not the real her but a contructed version that Mike had said that she should present to Colin if she wanted to snare him. The next day at work, Abby discovers that Mike has quit her network to work for a local rival network: it seems so that he doesn't have to see her. Abby's boss informs her in no uncertain terms that she needs to get Mike back on their network within a week or the loss of ratings may mean the end of their network. So Abby comes up with a clever plan to attempt to get Mike back onto The Ugly Truth and back into her life by indirectly criticising him and his fear of relationships on TV, hoping to appeal to his pride. With Abby going all out to get her man and Mike considering whether to succumb to his ego and speak to her again, will true love prevail?Comments: this was a most promising film. Katherine Heigl's character, although suffering from a few wobbles, generally makes for a most pleasing heroine and Gerard Butler is also excellent as our hero who turns out to be more than just the sexist womanising pig he initially appears to be. The film has a lot of insightful observations about sex and relationships and made me laugh a lot. Katherine Heigl's character turns out to be someone that, although initially possessing unrealistic expectations of what she wants in a man that has meant that she has not been in a relationship or had sex for almost a year at the start of the film, is not afraid to not hesitate and go after her man despite the possibilty of rejection. There is also a strong cast of supporting characters (mainly Katherine Heigl's character's TV network work colleagues) and whilst the film is primarily a romantic comedy it also explores other themes such as sexism in the workplace and the nature of competition between rival TV networks in the battle for ratings. For me the stand-out scene from the film is where Katherine Heigl's and Gerard Butler's characters have that dance on a dancefloor because the chemistry and attraction between the two characters is so exhilarating. The film ends with a satisfying climax in a hot air balloon in the air surrounded by other hot air balloons with stunning scenery in the distance, and the beautiful cinematography of this scene perfectly matches the romance of not only the end of the film but a skillfully paced and well balanced movie. Although not a flawless film The Ugly Truth is another triumph for Katherine Heigl as she secures her place as the quintessential romantic comedy actress and comes highly recommended for men and women alike.",4,Another triumph for Katherine Heigl,1250640000,"08 19, 2009",2009,6329,"['Romantic', 'comedy', 'Sacramento', 'California', 'TV', 'producer', 'Abby', 'Richter', 'played', 'Katherine',

1282294,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B002P413IC,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[1, 2]","Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) is a producer for a local TV station's morning news program in Sacramento. The show is struggling, pulling in less viewers than reruns of Geraldo, and her boss Stuart (Nick Searcy) is looking for something to draw viewers to their morning show. When he finds out that a cable access show called The Ugly Truth run by Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler) is pulling in viewers thanks to Mike's brash attitude toward relationships, he brings The Ugly Truth to the morning show as a regular installment on the morning show, much to Abby's chagrin.Best known for his turn in 300 Gerard Butler has amassed a somewhat large female following (I'm sure the uniforms in 300 didn't hurt), making him something of a recent go-to guy for romantic comedies as of late. Katherine Heigl, originally of Grey's Anatomy fame, found her in to movies when Anne Hathaway dropped out of Knocked Up allowing her to jump into the lead female spot. Since then she seems to have taken a spot in the lead in several romantic comedies appearing next in romantic action comedy Killers with Ashton Kutcher. So coming from somewhat different backgrounds how do these two play together in the movies?Fairly well. In a movie like this, you need to believe that the main characters despise each other, and Heigl embodies that in this movie. And while Chadway, if played improperly, could come off as totally unlikeable, Butler makes you like this sexist neo-perv. It's in the characterizations and acting that the movie grabs your attention and pulses with the ability to make you laugh. Another thing that I found more welcome on my end, was the R rating for a romantic comedy, something that you don't typically see in most romantic comedies. The willingness to push things just a little further was kind of refreshing.I can't really say there's much that I didn't enjoy with this movie. As I've said before in my review of The Proposal, this movie doesn't reinvent the romantic comedy, nor does it need to. In the end it's fairly by the numbers, but does more to bring in audience members from both sexes, making it a much better date movie than you can typically come to expect from most romantic comedies. I recommend this movie, especially to guys who need a romantic comedy to watch with their women.4/5",4,The Ugly Truth,1273536000,"05 11, 2010",2010,2299,"['Abby', 'Richter', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'producer', 'local', 'TV', 'station', 'morning', 'news', 'program', 'Sacramento', 'show', 'struggling', 'pulling', 'less', 'viewers', 'reruns', 'Geraldo', 'boss', 'Stuart', 'Nick', 'Searcy', 'looking', 'something', 'draw', 'viewers', 'morning', 'show', 'When', 'out', 'cable', 'access', 'show', 'called', 'Ugly', 'Truth', 'run', 'Mike', 'Chadway', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'pulling', 'viewers', 'thanks', 'Mike', 'brash', 'attitude', 'relationships', 'Ugly', 'Truth', 'morning', 'show', 'regular', 'installment', 'morning', 'show', 'much', 'Abby', 'chagrin.Best', 'known', 'turn', '300', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'amassed', 'somewhat', 'large', 'female', 'following', ""'m"", 'sure', 'uniforms', '300', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'making', 'something', 'recent', 'go-to', 'guy', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'late', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'originally', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'fame', 'found', 'movies', 'when', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'dropped', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'allowing', 'jump', 'lead', 'female', 'spot', 'then', 'have', 'taken', 'spot', 'lead', 'several', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'appearing', 'next', 'romantic', 'action', 'comedy', 'Killers', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'So', 'coming', 'somewhat', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'how', 'do', 'two', 'play', 'together', 'movies', 'Fairly', 'well', 'movie', 'need', 'believe', 'main', 'characters', 'despise', 'other', 'Heigl', 'embodies', 'movie', 'Chadway', 'played', 'improperly', 'could', 'come', 'off', 'totally', 'unlikeable', 'Butler', 'sexist', 'neo-perv', 'characterizations', 'acting', 'movie', 'grabs', 'attention', 'pulses', 'ability', 'make', 'laugh', 'thing', 'found', 'more', 'welcome', 'end', 'was', 'R', 'rating', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'typically', 'see', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'willingness', 'push', 'things', 'just', 'little', 'further', 'was', 'kind', 'refreshing.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'said', 'review', 'Proposal', 'movie', ""n't"", 'reinvent', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'need', 'end', 'fairly', 'numbers', 'more', 'bring', 'audience', 'members', 'sexes', 'making', 'much', 'better', 'date', 'movie', 'can', 'typically', 'come', 'expect', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'recommend', 'movie', 'especially', 'guys', 'who', 'need', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'watch', 'women.4/5']",N/A

This is a Rock Hudson/Doris Day movie in today's world"". The fact is she was right. THE UGLY TRUTH is a romantic comedy not unlike those old films. Sadly they don't make enough of them that are truly funny. Fortunately they have with this one.Katherine Heigl plays Abby Richter, a stuffy TV morning news show producer who knows her job but is fighting a losing battle as ratings are plummeting. Her co-anchors are married and constantly bickering. Her love life consists of pre-arranged dates where she takes along a fact check sheet as well as topics for discussion. Worst of all if things don't change the affiliates are going to pull the plug on the show.At the same time a cable access regular Joe named Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler) is getting great viewer response being a total jerk when it comes to advice about how men should deal with women and how women should respond. His show, THE UGLY TRUTH tells it like it is, noting how men don't care about deeper meanings they just want a woman who looks good and can fulfill their every fantasy. Think Jerry Springer meets Dr. Phil with little class.Needless to say the station manager hires Mike in an attempt to garner better ratings and keep his job. Abby and Mike but heads from day one. Even more so since when she was watching his show the night before, she actually called in an attempt to set him straight. Unfortunately, she was doing all the things he said a desperate woman does proving him right.Mike starts out with a small segment on the news program that is scripted and ready to go. Except he doesn't work that way. Instead, he confronts the two co-anchors and by the time he finishes, their love life has been discussed on the air and they've made up. Score one for Mike.Abby finds it all difficult to take. Going home that night, her cat escapes her apartment out a window and she climbs a tree to retrieve him. In the tree she finds herself looking into the window of the next apartment and the new neighbor, Colin (Eric Wright). When she falls from the tree and gets stuck, he comes to her rescue. With all of the attributes she looks for and described to Mike, she sets her sights on Colin.A battle of wills ensues as Mike tells Abby that the way she handles things there is no way she can catch Colin. To prove his point he makes a bet: if she uses his techniques and catches Colin, he stays on the show with no more complaints from Abby. If she doesn't, he'll leave the show without a fight.What follows is Mike's attempt to change Abby into the woman (in his view) men want to date. He changes her clothes from semi-frumpy to sexy. He tells her how to talk, going so far as to give her an earplug to talk to her during her dates. Through the course of it all, Abby loses herself but gains Colin. Unfortunately, she garners the attention of Mike as well who sees not just the new persona but the woman beneath, something he thought didn't exist.The closer the duo come together both at work and as teacher and mentor, the closer they come together as a couple as well. From the start of the film you know some form of attraction is going to rear its head with these two. It's the getting there that makes the movie fun to watch.Romantic comedies rarely seem to work these days. Most come and go at the box office with little respect or attention. Even this film did that when it opened. Too bad because with the exception of a bit of vulgar language, this film really does offers laughs and romance in equal quantities. It does fulfill the need out there for this sort of film.Heigl and Butler are stars on the rise, both having been in substantial hits but not quite to the point where they can make or break a film. This film should have helped them both over the hump as each turns in credible characters that you start out disliking a bit and then come to feel for as each new level of their personality unfolds.The truth about THE UGLY TRUTH is that yes, guys can be shallow and yes, women can be too domineering. But not all fit the mold and more often than not what lies beneath shows more of the person than the surface. It's a lesson learned by the two main characters in this film and one more people should realize. Watching this film is a good start and fortunately it offers plenty of laughs along the way.",4,LAUGHTER IN TRUTH,1259712000,"12 2, 2009",2009,4391,"['was', 'watching', 'film', 'wife', 'turned', 'said', 'Do', 'know', 'what', 'Rock', 'Hudson/Doris', 'Day', 'movie', 'today', 'world', 'fact', 'was', 'right', 'THE', 'UGLY', 'TRUTH', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'not', 'old', 'films', 'Sadly', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'enough', 'are', 'truly', 'funny', 'Fortunately', 'have', 'one.Katherine', 'Heigl', 'Abby', 'Richter', 'stuffy', 'TV', 'morning', 'news', 'show', 'producer', 'who', 'job', 'fighting', 'losing', 'battle', 'ratings', 'are', 'plummeting', 'co-anchors', 'are', 'married', 'constantly', 'bickering', 'love', 'life', 'pre-arranged', 'dates', 'where', 'fact', 'check', 'sheet', 'as', 'well', 'topics', 'discussion', 'Worst', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'affiliates', 'are', 'going', 'pull', 'plug', 'show.At', 'same', 'time', 'cable', 'access', 'regular', 'Joe', 'named', 'Mike', 'Chadway', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'getting', 'great', 'viewer', 'response', 'being', 'total', 'jerk', 'when', 'advice', 'how', 'men', 'should', 'deal', 'women', 'how', 'women', 'should', 'respond', 'show', 'THE', 'UGLY', 'TRUTH', 'noting', 'how', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'deeper', 'meanings', 'just', 'want', 'woman', 'who', 'good', 'can', 'fulfill', 'fantasy', 'Think', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'Dr.', 'Phil', 'little', 'class.Needless', 'say', 'station', 'manager', 'Mike', 'attempt', 'garner', 'better', 'ratings', 'keep', 'job', 'Abby', 'Mike', 'heads', 'day', 'one', 'Even', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'was', 'watching', 'show', 'night', 'actually', 'called', 'attempt', 'set', 'straight', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'doing', 'things', 'said', 'desperate', 'woman', 'proving', 'right.Mike', 'out', 'small', 'segment', 'news', 'program', 'scripted', 'ready', 'go', ""n't"", 'work', 'way', 'Instead', 'two', 'co-anchors', 'time', 'love', 'life', 'been', 'discussed', 'air', ""'ve"", 'made', 'up', 'Score', 'one', 'Mike.Abby', 'difficult', 'take', 'Going', 'home', 'night', 'cat', 'apartment', 'window', 'tree', 'retrieve', 'tree', 'looking', 'window', 'next', 'apartment', 'new', 'neighbor', 'Colin', 'Eric', 'Wright', 'When', 'tree', 'stuck', 'rescue', 'attributes', 'described', 'Mike', 'sights', 'Colin.A', 'battle', 'wills', 'ensues', 'Mike', 'Abby', 'way', 'things', 'way', 'can', 'catch', 'Colin', 'prove', 'point', 'bet', 'techniques', 'catches', 'Colin', 'show', 'more', 'complaints', 'Abby', ""n't"", ""'ll"", 'leave', 'show', 'fight.What', 'Mike', 'attempt', 'change', 'Abby', 'woman', 'view', 'men', 'want', 'date', 'clothes', 'semi-frumpy', 'sexy', 'how', 'talk', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'give', 'earplug', 'talk', 'dates', 'course', 'Abby', 'gains', 'Colin', 'Unfortunately', 'attention', 'Mike', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'not', 'just', 'new', 'persona', 'woman', 'beneath', 'something', 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist.The', 'closer', 'duo', 'come', 'together', 'work', 'teacher', 'mentor', 'closer', 'come', 'together', 'couple', 'as', 'well', 'start', 'film', 'know', 'form', 'attraction', 'going', 'rear', 'head', 'two', 'getting', 'there', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch.Romantic', 'comedies', 'rarely', 'seem', 'work', 'days', 'Most', 'come', 'go', 'box', 'office', 'little', 'respect', 'attention', 'Even', 'film', 'did', 'when', 'opened', 'Too', 'bad', 'exception', 'bit', 'vulgar', 'language', 'film', 'really', 'offers', 'laughs', 'romance', 'equal', 'quantities', 'fulfill', 'need', 'there', 'sort', 'film.Heigl', 'Butler', 'are', 'stars', 'rise', 'having', 'been', 'substantial', 'hits', 'not', 'quite', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'make', 'break', 'film', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'helped', 'hump', 'turns', 'credible', 'characters', 'start', 'out', 'disliking', 'bit', 'then', 'come', 'feel', 'new', 'level', 'personality', 'truth', 'THE', 'UGLY', 'TRUTH', 'yes', 'guys', 'can', 'be', 'shallow', 'yes', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'too', 'domineering', 'not', 'fit', 'mold', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'what', 'beneath', 'shows', 'more', 'person', 'surface', 'lesson', 'learned', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'people', 'should', 'realize', 'Watching', 'film', 'good', 'start', 'fortunately', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'way']",N/A

The writers actually pat themselves on the back for pointing out the differences between men and women, but in practice they only hit the worst parts of each gender and fail to give the characters any redeeming value.  Heigl and Butler have chemistry and are good actors, however their character's relationship was not fleshed out with anything close to reality, sensitivity, or love.  All others characters in this film are shallow caricatures of people.  The idea of lust (not exciting, just sadly disgusting) was the focus more than romance, and shockingly bad script ruined the whole film.

I was surprised when i didn't mind this film and rather enjoyed watching it with her. It has a lot of humor and sexually related humor that will likely keep a guy entertained. Guys if your girlfriend really wants to watch a click flick with you for a night in consider this it'll have you laughing and isn't too heavy.A very simple and short summary of the movie is: Katherine's character is a up tight single producer for a local news station. Gerard's character is a cocky single ladies man who is smooth talking. After insulting Katherine on his local broadcast show, The Ugly Truth, her bosses bring him on her show which clearly didnt sit well with her. Gerard bets Katherine that he can get her the guy of her dreams and if he does then she gets off his case.

The picture was without a doubt over-saturated when it was brought to Blu. I had to actually reset both of my displays to lower color/tint/bright and change the black setting. The interior shots at night and in the news station had so much green screen presence that maybe it explains the clarity lines being so blurry looking (not all the time). The sound was a decent DTS with the music giving it the best treatment (especially the road trip date withPocketful of Sunshineplaying). The supplements give this four star comedy another bump and include:* 16:22 minutes of deleted scenes. In watching these with large groups most agreed they should have been left in; they explained quite a few gaps - why she showed up at home with the ripped dress, how he acquired an agent, etc.* 5:12 minutes of alternate endings. One of them was dramatically different than what was seen in theaters - worth the watch.* 10:22 minute gag reel. Hilarious at times, a lot of ad-libs cut out.* 12:48 minute Truth is ugly. The writing/production crew's take on men and women regarding relationships. Some honest R-rated input on life.* 15:53 minute making of. Fluffy and reminiscent of how great it is to work with everyone.* Movie IQ. My PS3 took only a few seconds to load it up, but I am really under the impression it makes the pic go to a lower definition while it is on. Someone might prove me wrong but any time it was activated, the picture quality was way lower. It is still fun to use it though - especially if you are into music soundtracks, trivia and filming location material. It can either be selected each time it blinks or left on for the entire film (even while fast forwarding). The pop-up menu cannot work while this is activated so you have to re-boot the film to kill it.* BD Live. Nothing specific to this film yet, you just get the 100 points for registering the disc in Sony land.A funny movie with some great wit and truth about the genders, just not the best Blu for clarity - especially the balloon sequence at the end - the whole sequence looked so fake in hidef, yech.

The Ugly Truth certainly includes some crude materials, though I think it was long ago out-cruded byMy Best Friend's Girl [Blu-ray],American Pie - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)orGood Luck Chuck (Unrated) [Blu-ray]. Yeah, yeah, { without giving spoilers here directly } there is some material that some might be easily offended with, and the language is definitely crude, but if you're watching this film you probably know to expect that material already.  If not, then perhaps you should learn about a film before watching it, rather than simply jumping into viewing (perhaps because you figured that the stars wouldn't be in something that you find offensive).  Given Katherine Heigl's run of films, a resume which includesKnocked Up [Blu-ray] as an example, it probably would be good to NOT assume a sweet girl role for Heigl in everything she plays in.I mention aboveWhen Harry Met Sally... (Collector's Edition), but that's a bit old at this point.  Perhaps a newer film that shares a similar DNA would be sayHe's Just Not That Into You [Blu-ray], but there are plenty of others that follow the same basic formula, and if you really think about it, the formula here goes back (with some variations) through the ages all the way to Cyrano de Bergerac.  Character needs help from someone else who understands the type of person that character is looking for.Heigl brings charm to her character and flashes her smile and teeth even as she turns off her brain and takes the advice offered by Butler's character.  As she does, she is able to win the attention of a neighbor that seems to fit the profile (in her mind) of a perfect mate.  Will she wind up with that neighbor?  To find that out, you'll have to watch the film.Sony makes use of an interesting feature with this disc, at least on the Blu-ray release, via BD-Live.  If your Blu-ray player is connected to the internet and supports BD-Live you can enable the MovieIQ function that is included with the disc.  Once enabled you get the equivalent of pop-up trivia that can be accessed by pressing the Enter button on your player's remote control.  It's an interesting use of BD-Live and to this point in the history of Blu-ray disc technology this might be the first really interesting feature that might appeal to more than a handful of users.  On the other hand most people simply want to watch the movie and not be bothered with a bunch of trivia and background information so they may never engage the feature at all.  Those that do are greeted with a simple pop-up interface that is easy to navigate, but sadly one that tends to obliterate too much of the screen and also seems to show too little information on the first screen that pops up (you have to scroll around a bit, click on a 'more' type button to see the rest of the information, etc., and that becomes less useful than one might hope for).  A more translucent area for the pop-ups would be nice, though I suppose that with a variety of possible backgrounds that is difficult.  Alternatively, and perhaps more wisely, I'd suggest using the space that is otherwise occupied above or below the feature film.  The 'bug' or icon that shows that there's information available actually does show up in the bar above the film, but nothing else uses that space while the film is running, so that seems the perfect place to squeeze the MovieIQ information into.Picture quality and audio quality are quite good, though with a film this recent one would expect no less.This disc borders on a buy it recommendation from me.

1282375,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B002P413IC,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 6]","Abby (Katherine Heigl) produces a morning news program in Sacramento. Abby is smart, successful and takes her job very seriously. But she is also very lonely, which is no surprise after we watch her on a blind date, citing the guy's insurance coverage and financial aspects. ""I did a background check"". One night, she flips channels, talking to her cat, and stops for a few moments on channel 83. She watches in horror as Mike (Gerard Butler) hosts a public access show called ""The Ugly Truth"" advising guys on how to get dates with women with information that is less than politically correct. The next morning, she is shocked to learn he has been hired by her boss to provide 'local color' and help boost the ratings of the morning news. Desperate to keep her job, Abby decides to give it a chance. As they get to know each other, Abby learns to loathe him even more. But she is also desperate to get a date with a hunky doctor who lives in her building (Eric Winter). When Mike finds this out, he makes a bet; if he can help her get a date with the doctor, she will welcome him to the show. If he fails, he will quit. You can probably write the rest of the story yourself from this point.Directed by Robert Luketic (""Legally Blond""), ""The Ugly Truth"" doesn't have originality going for it. And it can't credit a refreshing lack of narrative contrivances for its success either. But it is a funny, frothy, perfectly forgettable date movie. In all likelihood, this film will make you laugh on your date and you will remember you had a good time. That's a good thing. But you probably won't remember a lot about this film. Except for one very memorable scene.""The Ugly Truth"" falls victim to almost everything ""The Proposal"" didn't. But it still works.And the reason for that has to be the two leads. Katherine Heigl is a very pretty woman and I think what I like about her even more is that she seems to be a very pretty, normal sized woman. I could be wrong, but she doesn't appear to be emaciating herself in an attempt to wear size zero jeans. She is a woman with some natural curves and they look good on her, giving her a look similar to some of the movie stars of the thirties and forties. Add her signature blond hair color and she could probably play Judy Holliday in a film biopic. Gerard Butler isn't your typical drop-dead gorgeous himbo. He's good looking, sure, but with his shirt on, he more closely resembles about a million guys you could run into on the street. But his crooked smile, his facial hair and his accent give him an interesting appeal, making him sexier because he is a little rough around the edges.Heigl also proves herself to be adept at comedy. After she gets embroiled in the bet with Mike, Abby reveals a secret and Mike is amazed. He talks about self-gratification and Abby immediately dismisses the notion. Mike can't believe it and soon a gift appears at her door. The whole sequence comes to a climax during a dinner with the hunky doctor and some network executives (don't ask). But this scene is easily one of the funniest I have seen on film in a long time. The set-up is long and involved, but Heigl makes us believe Abby would take the opportunity presented (and she makes the reason why just as believable). As the scene progresses, Heigl provides some hilarious reactions and gives Meg Ryan's performance in ""When Harry Met Sally"" a run for her money.Butler's Mike is funny simply because he says truly outrageous things, shocking us into laughing. When his character starts to become more normal, he also becomes more routine and more boring. You have to know that when a film pits two people like Heigl and Butler against one another, they will inevitably fall in love. As Mike begins to realize his true feelings for Abby (which we already know at this point), he becomes quieter, more introspective and more normal. When this happens, he also blends into the background and it becomes almost impossible to pick him out from the crowd. Abby and Mike end up in Los Angeles and go to dinner at a Brazilian restaurant complete with dancing. He coaxes her onto the dance floor and as the camera concentrates on Heigl, Butler all but gets lost among the other dancers. There simply isn't anything else about his character to make him interesting or believable, anything to make him worthy of our time and trouble.The husband and wife team who host the morning news program (played by Cheryl Hines (""The Larry David Show"") and John Michael Higgins (""Evan Almighty"", ""The Yes Man"")) are having marital problems. As soon as Mike enters the scene, he quickly realizes they are having problems and begins to work his magic on them, on camera, during the show. It is a funny idea, but they are pretty broad and make the film seem much more 'television sitcomy' than it might otherwise.Every romantic comedy uses a certain number of contrivances to get the characters into the right place, to weave a story around them. The success of the movie depends on the filmmaker's skill to make these contrivances seem normal, or to disappear altogether. Robert Luketic has created some fun films (""Legally Blond"") and some terrible films (""21"", ""Monster-In-Law ""). But he isn't a good enough director to make things like this seem normal, natural and real. When Abby realizes she has no choice but to work with Mike, she tries to produce his segment, like she normally would, with some class. When this doesn't work, she throws in the towel and embraces his little surprises, including two bimbos in a plastic pool of Jell-O. Later, Abby agrees to let this guy coach her and help her land a date with a guy? Why? This moment stretches the boundaries too much. Yes, we see her on a regular date, a date she sets up for herself, a date she controls. But that doesn't necessarily equate to the leap of faith she takes when she asks him to help her out. And his instructions are impossibly stupid and vague, leading her to humiliate herself. Which is funny, if very degrading to her character. Also, the story sets up an important dinner between Mike, the network executives and Abby. But Abby doesn't know about it and set-s up a date with the hunky doctor. Soon, the doctor is running late and Mike and the boss show up at Abby's door insisting she attend the dinner. She refuses because of the date with the doctor. They insist he come along. This is the set-up to the best scene in the movie, the funniest, but it is also the funniest because Abby is trying so hard to not humiliate herself in front of everyone who is important in her life. Only Mike eventually learns what is going on and he watches everything with a wry smile. Because these contrivances are not handled well, the film seems too artificial, too sitcomy.When we learn Mike lives with his sister and her son, he becomes a little more human. His nephew shows up at the station one day and meets Abby, who is shocked to learn Mike is part of the parental units looking after a pre-teen. But the character doesn't really add anything to the story and seems to be a timewaster. Or perhaps his scenes will appear on the DVD as ""Extras"". Either way, his character only points to the sloppy filmmaking that should have been handled differently by the director. But I'm not convinced Luketic has enough skill to handle such things.""The Ugly Truth"" is actually funny and will provide you with some laughs. I only wish the film were better, to make it more memorable.I guess I am damning the film with faint praise.",3,"Surprisingly Funny, But Still Not Very Good...

I bought this movie for two main reasons: one, because I knew that Gerard Butler was in it, and two because I was semi-interested in watching it, not really knowing exactly what to expect. After I bought it and before I sat down to watch it, I decided to check out some reviews on amazon and other websites to see what I was in for. It appeared as though a lot of reviews were mentioning the fact that it is very raunchy. Normally, this would deter me from viewing such a movie. Even after having read some of the reviews, I was still at least somewhat unsure of what exactly to expect. I went ahead and watched the movie. After having seen it now, I can kind of see where some people were coming from in terms of their opinions and what not of the plotline. It definitely wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but I wasn't exactly expecting it to fall into that category. It wasn't necessarily as bad as some people are saying. There were a few fleeting moments that were enjoyable to watch, most notably the very end. This is one of those movies that I honestly probably would not sit down and watch all the way through a second time. It's more the kind of movie that you'd pop in if you had like absolutely nothing else to do and you don't mind watching a movie that at times skews the male and female perspectives of the truth when it comes to dating and relationships. Katherine Heigl does an okay job in the movie, but it wasn't exactly what you'd call an Oscar-worthy performance. Gerard Butler was charming at times and a little funny and was the only reason that I wasn't bored while watching the movie.

Mike offends Abby's sensibility: she has a checklist about the perfect man, and she's found him in her new neighbor, Colin, a hunky doctor.

Obviously the producers (including the star Katherine Heigl) thought the film should appeal to both sexes. For better or worse, some aspects of ""The Ugly Truth"" are far from what we call ""chick flick.""The story is a standard one. Abby (Katherine Heigl) is a hard-working TV producer of early morning news show. However, her boss says they need to make changes to curb the sagging ratings, so a new personality is brought in. He is Mike (Gerald Butler) who spills the ugly truth about men and women in the extremely explicit fashion. Abby takes an instant dislike to the guy, but later she finds Mike's advice really works when she asks her handsome neighbor Colin (Eric Winter) out for dinner.You don't need to know the rest of the story because I think you already know that. Yes, Mike helps Abby out and while doing that, he is gradually attracted to her, and vice versa. Perhaps to some viewers, the main characters and their occasionally outrageous behaviors come off more irritating than funny (including one sequence in the restraint that reminds me of one famous Meg Ryan film). But somehow I didn't hate it.Throughout the film Gerald Butler and Katherine Heigl do their best, but the fact remains that ""The Ugly Truth"" is formulaic and clich&eacute;d.
