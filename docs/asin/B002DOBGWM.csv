Seriously I wanted to delete it and never look at it again. I was about to do that.  However, every time I've stopped myself. So I've watched it to the end and as you see by the rating, I liked it. It get's better with time as you watch it. The beginning may be bad to many people, and so it was even to me. But try it if you can. As for the music, it's like with the movie. I didn't like it until I saw almost half of the movie. It get's better in the end. As for the plot, it is similar in many ways to other movies, however still not a rip off and has some differences.

First of all: The franchise is really a trilogy (1,3,5), 2nd: Give this one a chance, you will be surprised. There were new lines that are repeatable, mostly spoken by the Character Gloria. These movies do present an element of cheese, but let's face it, that is what makes them fun. You aren't watching these with the intent in finding a new oscar contender. As soon as it was over, I wanted to watch again, something that I would never say about any of the others, except for the original. The movie finally brought it!!!! The music was good as well. I never heard a Christina Milian song in my life, and now I am looking to buy the soundtrack. It was a mixture of the 1st and 3rd movies brought together with a Step Up feel.

1263874,A2I12PBNLB6DRQ,B002DOBGWM,BeastNYC,"[1, 5]","Who said that Bring It On: Fight to the Finish is ""nothing to get excited about""? ... CHRISTINA MILIAN!!! She is so HOT!!! This ""Bring It On"" was pretty good. There were a lot of racial comments or race jokes aimed toward Lina and her friends which were unnecessary (this makes you dislike Avery and her cronies even more!!!). I don't know how anyone can cheer for Avery. Avery and her Jaguar friends are worse than ""The Plastics"" from ""Mean Girls"".Back to BIO 5, I agree with one of the other comments because there were a lot of stereotypes or overexagerrated portrayals of latinos & latinas (Gloria's boyfriend was the most annoying!!). The movie was good though (not just because of Xtina Milian!!!). Well ... come to think of it ...I only watched this movie because of Christina Milian!!! I &lt;3 her in ""Snow Globe"", ""Man of the House"", and ""Love Don't Cost a Thing"".The original ""Bring It On"" is the best one. I would say that ""Bring It On: FTTF"" is the second best!!Christina Milian delivers the star power. This movie was the third time that she played a cheerleader! 1) Love Don't Cost a Thing, 2) Man of the House, 3) BIO:FTTF. So, she knows how to play a cheerleader!!!Okay here is a ***Summary*** (without spoiling it).Lina has to move from her East LA neighborhood to Malibu because her mother got engaged to a very rich man. She has to leave her two best friends behind and she struggles to fit in at her new school. The villain Avery is captain of the All-Star cheerleader squad ""The Jaguars"" (who pratice elsewhere because they are not the official school cheerleaders). The school's cheerleading team ""The Sea Lions"" really stink and Lina (Xtina M) has to join them. She is elected captain and she has to try to turn The Sea Lions into Winners. ***This part was similar to ""Bring It On Again"" (worst BIO Movie!!), but it was done better here*** The asian girl on The Sealions is kind of cute and funny.So it is up to Lina and her crew to take on the evil Avery (who is also a SNITCH) and the Jaguars.You will enjoy this movie if you don't take is so serious. This is a great film about friendship and overcoming obstacles in your way.**THE SOUNDTRACK** is also nice. The other Bring It On movies (2,3, & 4) had no soundtrack. The only 2 with soundtracks are the Original ""Bring It On"" and part 5*~ BONUS FEATURES~* On this DVD were great! I loved Christina Milian's Video DiaryI still remember back in 2000, when my highschool friends and I went to the theater to go see ""Bring It On"". Great high school memory (which is why I wrote this review).I am glad to see that there is another entertaining ""Bring It On"" movie!!!The Bring It On series has survived a long time!!! I was in high school for the original (2000) and now I am in graduate school for ""Fight to the Finish"" (2009).Christina Milian has brought the ""Bring It On"" series back to life!!!Who knows? We could see ""Bring It On 6"" soon & then part 7!!!",3,Bring It On: Cinco es Fuego!!!,1261008000,"12 17, 2009",2009,2929,"['Who', 'said', 'Bring', 'Fight', 'Finish', 'nothing', 'get', 'excited', 'CHRISTINA', 'MILIAN', 'so', 'HOT', 'Bring', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'were', 'lot', 'racial', 'comments', 'race', 'jokes', 'aimed', 'Lina', 'friends', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'dislike', 'Avery', 'cronies', 'even', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'anyone', 'can', 'cheer', 'Avery', 'Avery', 'Jaguar', 'friends', 'are', 'worse', 'Plastics', 'Mean', 'Girls', '.Back', 'BIO', '5', 'agree', 'one', 'other', 'comments', 'were', 'lot', 'stereotypes', 'overexagerrated', 'portrayals', 'latinos', 'latinas', 'Gloria', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'most', 'annoying', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'just', 'Xtina', 'Milian', 'Well', 'come', 'think', 'only', 'watched', 'movie', 'Christina', 'Milian', 'lt', '3', 'Snow', 'Globe', 'Man', 'House', 'Love', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cost', 'Thing', 'original', 'Bring', 'best', 'one', 'would', 'say', 'Bring', 'FTTF', 'second', 'best', 'Christina', 'Milian', 'star', 'power', 'movie', 'was', 'third', 'time', 'played', 'cheerleader', '1', 'Love', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cost', 'Thing', '2', 'Man', 'House', '3', 'BIO', 'FTTF', 'So', 'how', 'play', 'cheerleader', 'Okay', 'here', '***Summary***', 'spoiling', 'move', 'East', 'LA', 'neighborhood', 'Malibu', 'mother', 'got', 'engaged', 'very', 'rich', 'man', 'leave', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'fit', 'new', 'school', 'villain', 'Avery', 'captain', 'All-Star', 'cheerleader', 'squad', 'Jaguars', 'who', 'pratice', 'elsewhere', 'are', 'not', 'official', 'school', 'cheerleaders', 'school', 'cheerleading', 'team', 'Sea', 'Lions', 'really', 'stink', 'Lina', 'Xtina', 'M', 'join', 'elected', 'captain', 'try', 'turn', 'Sea', 'Lions', 'Winners', '***This', 'part', 'was', 'similar', 'Bring', 'Again', 'worst', 'BIO', 'Movie', 'was', 'done', 'better', 'here***', 'asian', 'girl', 'Sealions', 'kind', 'cute', 'funny.So', 'Lina', 'crew', 'take', 'evil', 'Avery', 'who', 'also', 'SNITCH', 'Jaguars.You', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'so', 'serious', 'great', 'film', 'friendship', 'overcoming', 'obstacles', 'way', '**THE', 'SOUNDTRACK**', 'also', 'nice', 'other', 'Bring', 'movies', '2,3', '4', 'had', 'soundtrack', 'only', '2', 'soundtracks', 'are', 'Original', 'Bring', 'part', '5*~', 'BONUS', 'FEATURES~*', 'DVD', 'were', 'great', 'loved', 'Christina', 'Milian', 'Video', 'DiaryI', 'still', 'remember', 'back', '2000', 'when', 'highschool', 'friends', 'went', 'theater', 'go', 'see', 'Bring', 'Great', 'high', 'school', 'memory', 'why', 'wrote', 'review', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'entertaining', 'Bring', 'movie', 'Bring', 'series', 'survived', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'original', '2000', 'now', 'am', 'graduate', 'school', 'Fight', 'Finish', '2009', '.Christina', 'Milian', 'brought', 'Bring', 'series', 'back', 'life', 'Who', 'could', 'see', 'Bring', '6', 'soon', 'then', 'part', '7']",N/A

After watching the first four, I Was expecitng something spectacular... Little did I Realize, I'd be choking on those words Right after watching this particular sequel... I TRULY believe that Directors need to stop swapping hands, In film sequels, Which is what's happened with ""Fight To The Finish""...I think certain segments & Sequences run a little TOO long. This almost always makes me lose interest in a movie. The Other MAJOR downfall of this film, is the acting of certain actors (In this particular Case, Actresses), which is a Complete TURN OFF... I'm Speaking off course of the acting of ""Rachele Brooke Smith"" (Film Character reference: ""Avery"")...
