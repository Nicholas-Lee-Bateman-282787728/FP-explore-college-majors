Before popping that pill try these remedies. Through the video you will hear Rodney's soothing voice witch is calming for even the worst headache. Sometimes you will  feel an immediate, profound relief that will leave you glad you have this tape. Most of the listed props are only used in certain sections. A chair for fatigue. Bolsters (blankets will work fine) in the back pain section. In the headache section you really do need the blankets and blocks. I recommend investing in the Mats, block, and strap set that is sold on this site in the health and beauty section. This should be all you need. Bolsters are nice but expensive and not vital to the workout. All in all a great video for people who are looking for a Quick and easy solution to every day problems.",5,Great for every day ailments,993859200,"06 30, 2001",2001,888,"['tape', 'will', 'see', 'Susanne', 'Deason', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'offer', 'natural', 'solutions', 'day', 'problems', 'popping', 'pill', 'try', 'remedies', 'video', 'will', 'hear', 'Rodney', 'soothing', 'voice', 'witch', 'calming', 'even', 'worst', 'headache', 'Sometimes', 'will', 'feel', 'immediate', 'profound', 'relief', 'will', 'leave', 'glad', 'have', 'tape', 'Most', 'listed', 'props', 'are', 'only', 'used', 'certain', 'sections', 'chair', 'fatigue', 'Bolsters', 'blankets', 'will', 'work', 'fine', 'back', 'pain', 'section', 'headache', 'section', 'really', 'do', 'need', 'blankets', 'blocks', 'recommend', 'investing', 'Mats', 'block', 'strap', 'set', 'sold', 'site', 'health', 'beauty', 'section', 'should', 'be', 'need', 'Bolsters', 'are', 'nice', 'expensive', 'not', 'vital', 'workout', 'great', 'video', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'Quick', 'easy', 'solution', 'day', 'problems']",Yoga Journal's: Yoga Remedies for Natural Healing: For Beginners VHS
437750,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,6304851790,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[0, 0]","This is the original VHS release of a product that is currently in re-release by Gaiam and titled ""Healing Yoga.""  The video features five short yoga routines (each about 8.5 minutes), so the VHS format makes it somewhat awkward to maneuver from one to the next.  The practices are led by yoga instructor Rodney Yee, who teaches via voiceover.  In addition to the five main routines, the video begins with a 4-minute ""Conscious Breathing"" exercise:  here Yee leads the viewer through breath awareness while in a reclined position.  I have described each of the five main practices in detail below.Stress.  This practice is a bit shorter than the others (7.5 minutes), and it is designed to release tension from the head, neck, and shoulders; Yee demonstrates along with fellow yoga instructor Suzanne Deason.  It begins with several arm stretches, including stretching the arms overhead and into eagle arms.  There is also a single sun salutation and several standing poses (triangle, side angle, wide-legged standing forward bend).  The practice finishes with some additional arm stretches an a brief savasana.Indigestion.  Here Deason demostrates alone, beginning in a reclined position for a series of reclined twists.  Several variations on seated (sage) twists follow, and the routine concludes with child's and hero's poses.Back Pain.  This practice uses two blankets and a strap; Yee is practicing alone.  The props are used to facilitate several supported reclined postures.  There is a brief cat/cow stretch followed by down dog, and then cobra pose is practiced with the blanket under the hips.  The routine finishes in child's pose.Fatigue.  This practice uses a chair and two blankets, and I believe the demonstrator is Yee's ex-wife, Donna Fone.  The first posture is standing forward bend with the head supported on the chair, and then down dog is performed with the head supported on the block.  Next, the chair is again used to support the head in a seated forward bend.  The final pose was a sort of modified plow, resting the knees and the tops of the feet on the chair; this posture was a bit difficult to set up, especially given that not much time is allowed here.  The practice finishes with a brief rest with calves on the chair.Headache.  This session, which Yee leads alone, was a bit longer at 9.5 minutes.  It consists mainly of supported, restorative postures.  Yee uses two blankets and an eye bag for both legs-up-the-wall pose and a reclined lying chest opener with the feet at the wall.  This routine also includes practice of alternate nostril breathing and brief meditation.Overall, this video offers a nice selection of short yoga practices.  I would recommend it mainly to those with some prior yoga experience, as the practices move a bit quickly at times.  My favorite routine was the Stress, which required no props and which did not suffer from the lack of longer pose holds.  Finally, I would definitely recommend purchasing this practice in DVD format under its new name, Healing Yoga, to facilitate ease of use.",4,Nice offering of five short yoga practices for common conditions,1220054400,"08 30, 2008",2008,3054,"['original', 'VHS', 'release', 'product', 'currently', 're-release', 'Gaiam', 'titled', 'Healing', 'Yoga', 'video', 'five', 'short', 'yoga', 'routines', '8.5', 'minutes', 'VHS', 'format', 'somewhat', 'maneuver', 'one', 'next', 'practices', 'are', 'led', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'who', 'voiceover', 'addition', 'five', 'main', 'routines', 'video', '4-minute', 'Conscious', 'Breathing', 'exercise', 'here', 'Yee', 'viewer', 'breath', 'awareness', 'reclined', 'position', 'have', 'described', 'five', 'main', 'practices', 'detail', 'below.Stress', 'practice', 'bit', 'shorter', 'others', '7.5', 'minutes', 'designed', 'release', 'tension', 'head', 'neck', 'shoulders', 'Yee', 'fellow', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'Suzanne', 'Deason', 'several', 'arm', 'stretches', 'including', 'stretching', 'arms', 'overhead', 'eagle', 'arms', 'also', 'single', 'sun', 'salutation', 'several', 'standing', 'poses', 'triangle', 'side', 'angle', 'wide-legged', 'standing', 'forward', 'bend', 'practice', 'finishes', 'additional', 'arm', 'brief', 'savasana.Indigestion', 'Here', 'Deason', 'alone', 'beginning', 'reclined', 'position', 'series', 'reclined', 'twists', 'Several', 'variations', 'seated', 'sage', 'follow', 'routine', 'concludes', 'child', 'hero', 'poses.Back', 'Pain', 'practice', 'two', 'blankets', 'strap', 'Yee', 'practicing', 'alone', 'props', 'are', 'used', 'facilitate', 'several', 'supported', 'reclined', 'postures', 'brief', 'cat/cow', 'stretch', 'followed', 'down', 'dog', 'then', 'cobra', 'pose', 'practiced', 'blanket', 'hips', 'routine', 'finishes', 'child', 'pose.Fatigue', 'practice', 'chair', 'two', 'blankets', 'believe', 'demonstrator', 'Yee', 'ex-wife', 'Donna', 'Fone', 'first', 'posture', 'standing', 'forward', 'bend', 'head', 'supported', 'chair', 'then', 'down', 'dog', 'performed', 'head', 'supported', 'block', 'Next', 'chair', 'again', 'used', 'support', 'head', 'seated', 'forward', 'bend', 'final', 'pose', 'was', 'sort', 'modified', 'plow', 'resting', 'knees', 'tops', 'feet', 'chair', 'posture', 'was', 'bit', 'difficult', 'set', 'up', 'especially', 'given', 'not', 'much', 'time', 'allowed', 'here', 'practice', 'finishes', 'brief', 'rest', 'calves', 'chair.Headache', 'session', 'Yee', 'alone', 'was', 'bit', 'longer', '9.5', 'minutes', 'mainly', 'supported', 'restorative', 'postures', 'Yee', 'uses', 'two', 'blankets', 'eye', 'bag', 'legs-up-the-wall', 'pose', 'reclined', 'lying', 'chest', 'opener', 'feet', 'wall', 'routine', 'also', 'practice', 'alternate', 'nostril', 'breathing', 'brief', 'meditation.Overall', 'video', 'nice', 'selection', 'short', 'yoga', 'practices', 'would', 'recommend', 'mainly', 'prior', 'yoga', 'experience', 'practices', 'move', 'bit', 'quickly', 'times', 'favorite', 'routine', 'was', 'Stress', 'required', 'props', 'did', 'not', 'suffer', 'lack', 'longer', 'pose', 'Finally', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'practice', 'DVD', 'format', 'new', 'name', 'Healing', 'Yoga', 'facilitate', 'ease', 'use']",Yoga Journal's: Yoga Remedies for Natural Healing: For Beginners VHS

In fact I still do the ""Back"" segment almost every day as a little quickie extra practice before lunch each day to get the kinks out.I don't know if this is available anymore but I hope it is because for someone who needs some short Yoga Remedies this program is really useful!I guess if this isn't available, then I would recommend Suzanne Deason's ""Stress Relief Yoga For Beginners"" which is a wonderful  healing and gentle practice.

437752,A25IWKZ3OYWPK8,6304851790,justplainkaren,"[0, 0]","In some ways, this tape is as good as the rest of the Yoga Journal series with Rodney Yee, Patricia Walden, and Suzanne Deason.  The first section, ""Conscious Breathing"" is good daily practice, whether you are having health problems or not.  Likewise, the ""Stress remedy"" is a routine that oould be used every day as your usual yoga practice.  It's the best thing on the tape, in my opinion.I've used the ""Indigestion"" remedy as an alternative practice during my period. (No backbends, inverted poses, or vigorous standing poses.)  It's got some good, but gentle, exercises for your abdominal muscles, too.I use the ""Back"" section occasionally, when I feel like I need it.  But I get almost the same thing on the ""Awakening"" section of the Yoga for Energy DVD in the same series.  This one is a bit gentler, and so would be better if you're really hurting.Now, here's the bad news:  I was really disappointed by the ""Fatigue"" section.  This is something that I suffer from more frequently than the other ailments, but this ""remedy"" has positions I can't get myself into.  I can't put my forehead on the seat of a chair. (The back, maybe.)  And, no way can I flip myself over into the supported shoulderstand with knees on the chair. I'm much better off just putting my legs up the wall, or doing relaxation pose than going through this tape.The ""Headache"" portion didn't really impress me, either.  I'm no yoga expert, but I can put together a more useful headache remedy myself. (Neck stetches, eye rolls, etc.)  There was a nice demonstration of alternate nostril breathing, which is worthwhile technique to know.I'll add my vote to those who would like to see this in DVD.  Since these practices are all ""self-contained"", virtually everyone who uses this tape is going to want to skip portions, and a DVD format would be helpful with that.",3,Great parts; Not so Great Parts,1185926400,"08 1, 2007",2007,1842,"['ways', 'tape', 'as', 'good', 'rest', 'Yoga', 'Journal', 'series', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Patricia', 'Walden', 'Suzanne', 'Deason', 'first', 'section', 'Conscious', 'Breathing', 'good', 'daily', 'practice', 'are', 'having', 'health', 'problems', 'not', 'Likewise', 'Stress', 'remedy', 'routine', 'oould', 'be', 'used', 'day', 'usual', 'yoga', 'practice', 'best', 'thing', 'tape', 'opinion.I', ""'ve"", 'used', 'Indigestion', 'remedy', 'alternative', 'practice', 'period', 'backbends', 'inverted', 'poses', 'vigorous', 'standing', 'poses', 'got', 'good', 'gentle', 'exercises', 'abdominal', 'muscles', 'too.I', 'use', 'Back', 'section', 'occasionally', 'when', 'feel', 'need', 'get', 'almost', 'same', 'thing', 'Awakening', 'section', 'Yoga', 'Energy', 'DVD', 'same', 'series', 'one', 'bit', 'gentler', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'better', ""'re"", 'really', 'hurting.Now', 'here', 'bad', 'news', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'Fatigue', 'section', 'something', 'suffer', 'more', 'frequently', 'other', 'ailments', 'remedy', 'positions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'forehead', 'seat', 'chair', 'back', 'maybe', 'way', 'can', 'flip', 'supported', 'shoulderstand', 'knees', 'chair', ""'m"", 'much', 'better', 'off', 'just', 'putting', 'legs', 'up', 'wall', 'doing', 'relaxation', 'pose', 'going', 'tape.The', 'Headache', 'portion', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'impress', 'either', ""'m"", 'yoga', 'expert', 'can', 'put', 'together', 'more', 'useful', 'headache', 'remedy', 'Neck', 'stetches', 'eye', 'rolls', 'etc', 'was', 'nice', 'demonstration', 'alternate', 'nostril', 'breathing', 'worthwhile', 'technique', 'know.I', ""'ll"", 'add', 'vote', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'DVD', 'practices', 'are', 'self-contained', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'who', 'tape', 'going', 'want', 'skip', 'portions', 'DVD', 'format', 'would', 'be', 'helpful']",Yoga Journal's: Yoga Remedies for Natural Healing: For Beginners VHS
