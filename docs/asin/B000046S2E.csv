Where the stories are well written and for the most part, well acted, the experience of watching them was more like looking through an old family album than anything else. Not that my family is as strange as &#34;Twilight Zone&#34;...wait, yes it is. In any case, it was fun to remember what was scary years ago, and to see how much things have changed in the world since this series ran. It's just not something I would want to watch over and over like many of the black and white DVDs in my collection.",4,Inexpensive,1377820800,"08 30, 2013",2013,610,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'much', 'seemed', 'much', 'better', 'show', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'watching', 'Where', 'stories', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'most', 'part', 'well', 'acted', 'experience', 'watching', 'was', 'more', 'looking', 'old', 'family', 'album', 'anything', 'else', 'Not', 'family', 'as', 'strange', '34', 'Twilight', 'Zone', '34', 'wait', 'yes', 'case', 'was', 'fun', 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'scary', 'years', 'ago', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'world', 'series', 'ran', 'just', 'not', 'something', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'many', 'black', 'white', 'DVDs', 'collection']",The Twilight Zone: Vol. 5
546904,A7Y6AVS576M03,B000046S2E,gobirds2,"[16, 17]","I SING THE BODY ELECTRIC was Ray Bradbury's sole contribution to the ""Twilight Zone."" One of the more subtle episodes, this story is strong on characterization and reaches out on an emotional level rather than to any notion of scientific curiosity of the introduction of a robot grandmother, beautifully played by Josephine Hutchinson, into a family (including Veronica Cartwright). This is a very good episode and is one of my favorites.  THE LONELY is one of Rod Serling's classics from the series. Jack Warden convincingly plays a convict sentenced to forty years alone on a distant asteroid. A periodic supply ship commanded by John Dehner one day leaves him a companion, a robot played flawlessly by Jean Marsh. Bernard Herrmann's poignant score evokes the enigmatic inner feeling of Jack Warden's love for his companion. And subsequently Herrmann's score captures the human quality of this female robot as she reciprocates that love. The combination of scripting, acting and scoring realistically captures our perceptions of loneliness, love, loss and reality.  PROBE 7 - OVER AND OUT leisurely written by Rod Serling for the 5th Season examines the relationship of two beings, Richard Basehart and Antoinette Bower, the sole survivors of their respective annihilated planets. Basehart and the much underrated and forgotten Bower give good performances. LONG DISTANCE CALL written by Charles Beaumont and William Idelson is one of the six episodes recorded directly to videotape instead of being photographed on film. The story concerns a little boy played by Billy Mumy who communicates with his dead grandmother over his toy phone. Thematically it rounds out this volume as it examines our attachment to those we love.",4,The Meaning of Love and Attachment,983145600,"02 26, 2001",2001,1726,"['SING', 'BODY', 'ELECTRIC', 'was', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'sole', 'contribution', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'One', 'more', 'subtle', 'episodes', 'story', 'strong', 'characterization', 'out', 'emotional', 'level', 'rather', 'notion', 'scientific', 'curiosity', 'introduction', 'robot', 'grandmother', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Josephine', 'Hutchinson', 'family', 'including', 'Veronica', 'Cartwright', 'very', 'good', 'episode', 'one', 'favorites', 'LONELY', 'one', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'classics', 'series', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'convincingly', 'convict', 'sentenced', 'forty', 'years', 'alone', 'distant', 'asteroid', 'periodic', 'supply', 'ship', 'commanded', 'John', 'Dehner', 'one', 'day', 'companion', 'robot', 'played', 'flawlessly', 'Jean', 'Marsh', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'poignant', 'score', 'enigmatic', 'inner', 'feeling', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'love', 'companion', 'subsequently', 'Herrmann', 'score', 'human', 'quality', 'female', 'robot', 'love', 'combination', 'scripting', 'acting', 'scoring', 'realistically', 'perceptions', 'loneliness', 'love', 'loss', 'reality', '7', 'OVER', 'OUT', 'leisurely', 'written', 'Rod', 'Serling', '5th', 'Season', 'relationship', 'two', 'beings', 'Richard', 'Basehart', 'Antoinette', 'Bower', 'sole', 'survivors', 'respective', 'annihilated', 'planets', 'Basehart', 'much', 'underrated', 'forgotten', 'Bower', 'give', 'good', 'performances', 'LONG', 'DISTANCE', 'CALL', 'written', 'Charles', 'Beaumont', 'William', 'Idelson', 'one', 'six', 'episodes', 'recorded', 'directly', 'videotape', 'instead', 'being', 'photographed', 'film', 'story', 'little', 'boy', 'played', 'Billy', 'Mumy', 'who', 'dead', 'grandmother', 'toy', 'phone', 'Thematically', 'out', 'volume', 'attachment', 'love']",The Twilight Zone: Vol. 5
546905,A366S12KCZ280V,B000046S2E,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[0, 0]","Volume 5 of ""The Twilight Zone"" features four more classic episodes that are well known and beloved by Twilight Zone fans everywhere. Some of the volumes released of Twilight Zone series may have a couple of really good stories on it and one or two just so-so episodes. (I am a diehard fan of the show but even I will admit not every episode was good some could even be real clunkers) But with volume 5 you do get four outstanding episodes to watch with some big name actors to boot. So make some popcorn, get a cold drink, put your feet up and get ready for some great story telling.The first episode is ""Long Distance Call"". It is about a grandmother who is dying and is very close to her grandson. For his birthday she gives him a toy phone. The grandmother dies not too long after and not long after that the boy's parents find him talking on his toy phone to his departed grandmother. They think at first he just misses his grandmother but when the boy decides he wants to be with her the tension mounts. The young boy in this episode is played by Billy Mumy. Some may remember him as Will Robinson on ""Lost In Space"". But ""Twilight Zone"" fans may remember him even more as the creepy little boy in another classic TZ episode ""It's A Good Life"". Mummy made three episodes with TZ and they really show what a great child actor he was.The next episode is based on a Ray Bradbury screenplay. The title is ""I Sing The Body Electric"". A widower is raising his three children alone. Deciding they need a woman's influence in their lives the four of them go to a store where a robot can be designed for them as a grandmother figure. The oldest daughter, played by Veronica Cartwright, however wants nothing to do with her. She is still hurt by the death of her mother and does not want to be close to anyone anymore until an incident occurs that changes her mind.""The Lonely"" stars Jack Warden as a man convicted of murder and sentenced to life in solitude on an asteroid. Every few months a spaceship arrives with food and supplies for the convict. The captain of the spaceship takes pity on him with his loneliness and on one of his stops to the asteroid brings Warden a package. A robot in the shape of a woman he can put together for company. Everything works out great until Warden is given a pardon and can go home until he realizes what that means.In ""Probe 7, Over & Out"" two planets that have been at war with each other finally destroy each other leaving just two people, one from each planet, left. Richard Basehart, whose name is Adam, has crash landed on a planet during the battle. He eventually meets the other person from the opposing planet they were in battle with. She is a female whose name is... yup you guessed it Eve. They are on the planet Earth and the rest is history as they say.For anyone who is a huge fan of the show volume 5 is a must have because of these being some of the best episodes ""Twilight Zone"" ever had. For someone who has never seen the show before this volume would make a great introduction into ""The Twilight Zone"". Either way I highly recommend this DVD.",4,"Love, Death and Robots",1387497600,"12 20, 2013",2013,3100,"['Volume', '5', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'four', 'more', 'classic', 'episodes', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'beloved', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'fans', 'everywhere', 'volumes', 'released', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'series', 'may', 'have', 'couple', 'really', 'good', 'stories', 'one', 'two', 'just', 'so-so', 'episodes', 'am', 'diehard', 'fan', 'show', 'even', 'will', 'admit', 'not', 'episode', 'was', 'good', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'real', 'clunkers', 'volume', '5', 'do', 'get', 'four', 'outstanding', 'episodes', 'watch', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'boot', 'So', 'make', 'popcorn', 'get', 'cold', 'drink', 'put', 'feet', 'up', 'get', 'ready', 'great', 'story', 'telling.The', 'first', 'episode', 'Long', 'Distance', 'Call', 'grandmother', 'who', 'dying', 'very', 'close', 'grandson', 'birthday', 'toy', 'phone', 'grandmother', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'not', 'long', 'boy', 'parents', 'find', 'talking', 'toy', 'phone', 'departed', 'grandmother', 'think', 'first', 'just', 'grandmother', 'when', 'boy', 'be', 'tension', 'mounts', 'young', 'boy', 'episode', 'played', 'Billy', 'Mumy', 'may', 'remember', 'as', 'Will', 'Robinson', 'Lost', 'Space', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'fans', 'may', 'remember', 'even', 'more', 'creepy', 'little', 'boy', 'classic', 'TZ', 'episode', 'Good', 'Life', 'Mummy', 'made', 'three', 'episodes', 'TZ', 'really', 'show', 'what', 'great', 'child', 'actor', 'was.The', 'next', 'episode', 'based', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'screenplay', 'title', 'Sing', 'Body', 'Electric', 'widower', 'raising', 'three', 'children', 'alone', 'Deciding', 'need', 'woman', 'influence', 'lives', 'four', 'go', 'store', 'where', 'robot', 'can', 'be', 'designed', 'grandmother', 'figure', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'played', 'Veronica', 'Cartwright', 'however', 'nothing', 'do', 'still', 'hurt', 'death', 'mother', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'close', 'anyone', 'anymore', 'incident', 'mind', 'Lonely', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'man', 'convicted', 'murder', 'sentenced', 'life', 'solitude', 'asteroid', 'Every', 'few', 'months', 'spaceship', 'food', 'supplies', 'convict', 'captain', 'spaceship', 'pity', 'loneliness', 'one', 'stops', 'asteroid', 'brings', 'Warden', 'package', 'robot', 'shape', 'woman', 'can', 'put', 'together', 'company', 'Everything', 'out', 'great', 'Warden', 'given', 'pardon', 'can', 'go', 'home', 'what', 'Probe', '7', 'Over', 'Out', 'two', 'planets', 'have', 'been', 'war', 'other', 'finally', 'destroy', 'other', 'leaving', 'just', 'two', 'people', 'one', 'planet', 'left', 'Richard', 'Basehart', 'name', 'Adam', 'crash', 'landed', 'planet', 'battle', 'eventually', 'other', 'person', 'opposing', 'planet', 'were', 'battle', 'female', 'name', 'yup', 'guessed', 'Eve', 'are', 'planet', 'Earth', 'rest', 'history', 'say.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'huge', 'fan', 'show', 'volume', '5', 'must', 'have', 'being', 'best', 'episodes', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'ever', 'had', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'volume', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'introduction', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'way', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD']",The Twilight Zone: Vol. 5
546906,A1Y87E22UVYCE6,B000046S2E,"Maximiliano F Yofre ""Maxi""","[8, 8]","From my teens this is one of the series that I more fondly remember. As a sci-fi fan I was attracted by ""The Twilight Zone"" proposal. At that time I wasn't able to see more than a score of episodes, but they remain in my memory with extraordinary persistence.Thanks to the technological marvel of DVD I'm able to see these amazing stories again and find them as magical & thought provoking as 45 years ago.As the structure of the episodes are mostly bounded to a surprise ending or to the argument in a very short span of time of 25 minutes each, I'll focus my review more on outstanding features than on the topic of the episode in order not to spoil the pleasure of the viewer.Disk 5 contains four good chapters with intermixing themes: Grandmas, robots & loneliness.1) Long Distance Call - Is love so powerful as to defy death?This chapter is, in a certain level, more complex than ordinary TTZ episodes as it cast lights & shadows on family relationships, transcending the anecdote.This episode was written by Charles Beaumont, a major contributor to The Twilight Zone scripts, he totalized 22.Bill Mumy fleshes Billy Bailey with natural freshness; he is best remembered by his role as Will Robinson in ""Lost in Space"" series.Qualification: 8.2) I Sing the Body Electric - The most noticeable trait of this chapter is: it is the only one written by Ray Bradbury who was a sort of ""alma mater"" of the main writers of the series.The story is rather simple a recent mature widower is pressed by a ""well meaning"" lady to leave his three children at her charge. Father & siblings refuse and request help from a robot grandma.Once more as in other episodes brilliant cinematography in charge of George Clemens contributes to the excellence of this chapter. Clemens won Emmy Award 1961 and nominations for the same honor 1962 & 1963 all due to several episodes of this series. He filmed 112 episodes of this series.Veronica Cartwright performing as the conflictive pre-teen girl is outstanding.Qualification: 10.3) The Lonely - A solitary, almost crazed, convict receives from his generous guardian a strange gift.This is an episode written by Rod Sterling in person delivering a forceful story that seeks deeply in human emotions.Jim Warden & very beautiful Jean Marsh perform greatly.Qualification: 10.4) Probe 7, Over and Out - A stranded pilot finds a stranded woman from another planet. It is a classical TWLZ episode.Richard Basehart as Adam Cook gives a good performance. He is well remembered for his characterization as Adm. Harriman Nelson in ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea""Qualification: 9.This DVD series presentation has two great advantages: it has a very good price and allows buyers to choose their favorite chapters without needing to buy the whole series.Reviewed by Max Yofre.",5,Grandmothers & Lonely People.,1202083200,"02 4, 2008",2008,2794,"['teens', 'one', 'series', 'more', 'fondly', 'remember', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'was', 'attracted', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'proposal', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'see', 'more', 'score', 'episodes', 'remain', 'memory', 'extraordinary', 'persistence.Thanks', 'technological', 'marvel', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'able', 'see', 'amazing', 'stories', 'again', 'find', 'magical', 'thought', 'provoking', '45', 'years', 'ago.As', 'structure', 'episodes', 'are', 'mostly', 'bounded', 'surprise', 'ending', 'argument', 'very', 'short', 'span', 'time', '25', 'minutes', ""'ll"", 'focus', 'review', 'more', 'outstanding', 'features', 'topic', 'episode', 'order', 'not', 'spoil', 'pleasure', 'viewer.Disk', '5', 'contains', 'four', 'good', 'chapters', 'intermixing', 'themes', 'Grandmas', 'robots', 'loneliness.1', 'Long', 'Distance', 'Call', 'love', 'so', 'powerful', 'defy', 'death', 'chapter', 'certain', 'level', 'more', 'complex', 'ordinary', 'TTZ', 'cast', 'lights', 'shadows', 'family', 'relationships', 'transcending', 'anecdote.This', 'episode', 'was', 'written', 'Charles', 'Beaumont', 'major', 'contributor', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'scripts', 'totalized', '22.Bill', 'Mumy', 'fleshes', 'Billy', 'Bailey', 'natural', 'freshness', 'best', 'remembered', 'role', 'Will', 'Robinson', 'Lost', 'Space', 'series.Qualification', '8.2', 'Sing', 'Body', 'Electric', 'most', 'noticeable', 'trait', 'chapter', 'only', 'one', 'written', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'who', 'was', 'sort', 'alma', 'mater', 'main', 'writers', 'series.The', 'story', 'rather', 'simple', 'recent', 'mature', 'widower', 'pressed', 'well', 'meaning', 'lady', 'leave', 'three', 'children', 'charge', 'Father', 'siblings', 'refuse', 'request', 'help', 'robot', 'grandma.Once', 'more', 'other', 'episodes', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'charge', 'George', 'Clemens', 'excellence', 'chapter', 'Clemens', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Award', '1961', 'nominations', 'same', 'honor', '1962', '1963', 'due', 'several', 'episodes', 'series', 'filmed', '112', 'episodes', 'series.Veronica', 'Cartwright', 'performing', 'conflictive', 'pre-teen', 'girl', 'outstanding.Qualification', '10.3', 'Lonely', 'solitary', 'almost', 'crazed', 'convict', 'receives', 'generous', 'guardian', 'strange', 'gift.This', 'episode', 'written', 'Rod', 'Sterling', 'person', 'delivering', 'forceful', 'story', 'deeply', 'human', 'emotions.Jim', 'Warden', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Jean', 'Marsh', 'perform', 'greatly.Qualification', '10.4', 'Probe', '7', 'Over', 'Out', 'stranded', 'pilot', 'stranded', 'woman', 'planet', 'classical', 'TWLZ', 'episode.Richard', 'Basehart', 'Adam', 'Cook', 'good', 'performance', 'well', 'remembered', 'characterization', 'Adm.', 'Harriman', 'Nelson', 'Voyage', 'Bottom', 'Sea', 'Qualification', '9.This', 'DVD', 'series', 'presentation', 'two', 'great', 'advantages', 'very', 'good', 'price', 'buyers', 'choose', 'favorite', 'chapters', 'needing', 'buy', 'whole', 'series.Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",The Twilight Zone: Vol. 5
