1230593,AJLPBMAJKIKOK,B001QDBX6A,Christopher Thomas Rennirt,"[46, 56]","After reading reviews of Eden Log, and after seeing the movie myself, I agree that you either love it or hate it.  There is little room for a middle of the road reaction to this one.  As with so many others, it's all about what you expect and appreciate from movies that break the mold of formula and predictability.I tend to be more in love with the movie for its uniqueness above all else.  In a world where everything has already been done, making the newest of movies a clich&eacute;d rehash of something seen before, this movie goes all out to avoid those pitfalls, becoming something refreshingly new.  Of course, the inescapable and limited themes (man vs. man, man vs. nature, man vs. himself, etc.) are there, but that's where the familiarities end.I must stress, however, that creating something new these days also involves a large amount of courage to create what can largely be disliked.  The director and writer of this movie had some serious courage, for sure.  Eden Log is incoherent much of the time, defying most attempts to make any sense of the plot through the better part of its running time.  However, any astute viewer will quickly realize and appreciate the fact that this movie is confusing by intention rather than by chance or failure.  Of course, I'm not suggesting that a movie can be good merely because it is confusing.  There is, I think, in this movie, order and meaning to be discovered, with enough patience and thought, within all the chaos and confusion.  Yes, from the very beginning, the viewer is offered a most unique puzzle to be solved.The viewer is introduced to the main character in the pulsing bright light of an otherwise pitch-black cavern.  As for where this dark place is, no one can possibly know at this point.  Even whether it's on earth or elsewhere is not to be known.  As we watch the character emerge sluggishly from the mud and muck, we are, with flashing lights and confusion, about as disoriented as the character himself.  From there, the character attempts to learn who he is, just as we do, clumsily and often incorrectly connecting piecemeal clues found here and there.  Yes, this movie puts the viewer in the first person position, with virtually no objective views of anything.  All we see, hear, and experience are as subjective as that experienced by the main character.  He is pursued by mutant creatures of unknown significance, through endless passageways that mostly lead nowhere of importance.  Of course, I won't go on with anything more; I wouldn't want to spoil the charm of this movie for all those who may choose to see it.  Certainly that is the way this movie is best-watched anyway--without a single clue revealed by another viewer.  Even knowing what others think it all means is too much.  Again, the not-knowing is what truly makes this movie so unique and effective.  Some of the best movies leave much meaning to the mind of the viewer, instead of revealing everything there is to think and know.  Eden Log indeed plants many unique ideas in the mind of every individual who sees it.Eden Log could have been another monument to mediocrity, easily forgotten and lost amongst everything else of its kind.  It could have played it safe and been like a million other movies getting, at least consistently, more so-so reviews.  Instead, it dares to be different and transcends the muck of mediocrity.",4,Transcending the Muck of Mediocrity,1243036800,"05 23, 2009",2009,3383,"['reading', 'reviews', 'Eden', 'Log', 'seeing', 'movie', 'agree', 'love', 'hate', 'little', 'room', 'middle', 'road', 'reaction', 'one', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'what', 'expect', 'appreciate', 'movies', 'break', 'mold', 'formula', 'predictability.I', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'love', 'movie', 'uniqueness', 'else', 'world', 'where', 'everything', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'making', 'newest', 'movies', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'rehash', 'something', 'seen', 'before', 'movie', 'avoid', 'pitfalls', 'becoming', 'something', 'refreshingly', 'new', 'course', 'inescapable', 'limited', 'themes', 'man', 'vs.', 'man', 'man', 'vs.', 'nature', 'man', 'vs.', 'etc', 'are', 'there', 'where', 'familiarities', 'end.I', 'must', 'stress', 'however', 'creating', 'something', 'new', 'days', 'also', 'large', 'amount', 'courage', 'create', 'what', 'can', 'largely', 'be', 'disliked', 'director', 'writer', 'movie', 'had', 'serious', 'courage', 'sure', 'Eden', 'Log', 'incoherent', 'much', 'time', 'defying', 'most', 'attempts', 'make', 'sense', 'plot', 'better', 'part', 'running', 'time', 'However', 'astute', 'viewer', 'will', 'quickly', 'realize', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'movie', 'confusing', 'intention', 'rather', 'chance', 'failure', 'course', ""'m"", 'not', 'suggesting', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'merely', 'confusing', 'think', 'movie', 'order', 'meaning', 'be', 'discovered', 'enough', 'patience', 'thought', 'chaos', 'confusion', 'Yes', 'very', 'beginning', 'viewer', 'offered', 'most', 'unique', 'puzzle', 'be', 'solved.The', 'viewer', 'introduced', 'main', 'character', 'pulsing', 'bright', 'light', 'otherwise', 'pitch-black', 'cavern', 'where', 'dark', 'place', 'one', 'can', 'possibly', 'know', 'point', 'Even', 'earth', 'elsewhere', 'not', 'be', 'known', 'watch', 'character', 'emerge', 'sluggishly', 'mud', 'muck', 'are', 'flashing', 'lights', 'confusion', 'about', 'as', 'disoriented', 'character', 'there', 'character', 'attempts', 'learn', 'who', 'just', 'do', 'clumsily', 'often', 'incorrectly', 'connecting', 'piecemeal', 'clues', 'found', 'here', 'there', 'Yes', 'movie', 'viewer', 'first', 'person', 'position', 'virtually', 'objective', 'views', 'anything', 'see', 'hear', 'experience', 'are', 'as', 'subjective', 'experienced', 'main', 'character', 'pursued', 'mutant', 'creatures', 'unknown', 'significance', 'endless', 'passageways', 'mostly', 'lead', 'nowhere', 'importance', 'course', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'anything', 'more', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'charm', 'movie', 'who', 'may', 'choose', 'see', 'Certainly', 'way', 'movie', 'best-watched', 'anyway', 'single', 'clue', 'revealed', 'viewer', 'Even', 'knowing', 'what', 'others', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'Again', 'not-knowing', 'what', 'truly', 'movie', 'so', 'unique', 'effective', 'best', 'movies', 'leave', 'much', 'meaning', 'mind', 'viewer', 'instead', 'revealing', 'everything', 'there', 'think', 'know', 'Eden', 'Log', 'indeed', 'plants', 'many', 'unique', 'ideas', 'mind', 'individual', 'who', 'it.Eden', 'Log', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'monument', 'mediocrity', 'easily', 'forgotten', 'lost', 'amongst', 'everything', 'else', 'kind', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'safe', 'been', 'million', 'other', 'movies', 'getting', 'least', 'consistently', 'more', 'so-so', 'reviews', 'Instead', 'be', 'different', 'muck', 'mediocrity']",Eden Log

1230596,A27KV48VR7PQTL,B001QDBX6A,Daniel J Munt,"[0, 0]","Where to begin. First I suppose I should point out that many people (both those who hate it and those who love it) seem to disagree with what the film is about and what kind of genera it falls into.  It is not a horror movie, it is a psychological science fiction thriller.  It is not about the environment, it is the story of a distopian society where immigrants are sent to 'work' at the Eden Log power facility, only the facility doesn't work the way the general public believes, the tree (an engineered tree located at eden log) that was supposed to produces the energy for the city went 'rouge' protecting itself by mutating victims into monsters.  Unable to drain the energy sap from the tree the Eden Log crew needed a new way to generate energy, enter the immigrants. Who are drained in a plantation to provide the energy.  The issue we face (as viewers) is that we view the entire story from the inside out, not just from inside the eden log facility, but from the inside of the muddled mind of someone who isn't sure what is going on himself.  On top of that what we say takes place after the facility is on the brink of collapse from the mutants.  Ultimately the protagonist decides that the best course of action is to end it all using himself as a catalyst for the downfall of civilization, possibly of humanity.Core concept wise it isn't a bad story, or a bad approach to telling an interesting dystopian tale.  However, it falls flat on the execution of the film.  As I understand it the film was originally in French and that some things may be lost in translation, and that the voice acting may have more to do with some of the 'acting' problems than the actual acting did.  Whatever, I can ignore that for the time being.Just a quick repost of the synopsis for anyone who has already forgotten &#34;A man wakes up deep inside a cave. Suffering amnesia, he has no recollection of how he came to be here or of what happened to the man whose body he finds beside him. Tailed by a mysterious creature, he must continue through this strange and fantastic world.&#34;Getting right into the film the first thing we notice (as others have pointed out) is a pretty long sequence relying on a bright flashing light.  Kind of annoying, however, what gets me here and my first criticism of the actual film is that the protagonist who supposedly remembers nothing at this point (or so we are led to believe by the synopsis given by Amazon) he does no exploring, doesn't look around, just immediately starts climbing (when he was obviously in a larger chamber).  Moving on he continues to fail to look around or search bodies for anything useful.  I mean he is half naked without a weapon  Why does he only bother collecting the data disk and a jacket?  We find out at the end of the film this guy is some kind of a security specialist sent into the depths of the Eden Log facility to quell the immigrant uprising (you know vicious mutants and people who discovered that they are there to die).  If we assume his reasoning behind making a B-line is that he was guided by instinct, wouldn't his instinct as a security specialist be to arm himself against the unknown?  Just saying.Continuing on, he runs into members of the security team.  I remind you that at this point he is not in any sort of disguise, yet they hunt him and don't seem to recognize him.  Neither does the scientist he runs into, who hooks him up to the tree (which then feeds off of him).  She seems shocked at this, later however we see the report from her level of the lab showing that she knows it is eating people.  Why is she surprised?  Also why does she not recognize someone who is obviously important to the operations of the facility?  They never met or ran across each other?  Fine we can go with that.  She runs off and leaves him for dead.  He makes chase and catches her in the elevator, turns out he is infected with the mutation.  Though they aren't clear on it he has been infected the whole time (though he may or may not be a carrier).  He proceeds to rape her.Dragging on we collect more memory cards and nothing else, we take no time for the development of the characters or the situation.  We simply know that they are in danger from the mutants and trying to get out.  At the top (because nothing really important happens between when they meet and when they get to the top) she realizes she is infected and leaves (leaving him with her memory card).  He scoots past the guards and transmits all of the memory cards to the surface and realizes that he is one of the security team.  His concious bugs him though and rather than re-starting the facility he hooks himself in, feeds the tree his mutant blood, and brings about the end of the Eden Log facility.My two biggest issues with this film are (and in no particular order of import):  First, it drug on without really adding to the story, plot, or character development.  One person who gave a bad review stated that this 1.5 hour movie felt like 5.  Maybe not 5, but definitely 3.  It didn't sustain and it didn't deliver, it is perfectly fine to leave things to the viewers imagination, but we shouldn't have to develop the characters in our minds too.  Second, this film was just begging to be an art film, but it failed.  The desaturation was more distracting than anything.  The attempt at creating a mood with sound and flashing lights and heavy breathing fell to the mood of a film an amateur might have made on his/her first project.  Because this film was trying so hard to be artistic it failed on the sci-fi and thriller accounts as well, obvious and trite the people who call this a cerebral film probably say the same thing about M. Night Shamalan's work.  Feeling the need to drag the greater part of exposition to the last 5 minutes of the film (which makes you wonder about the value of the other 85), they lost the concept that a film or a story is a journey and not a destination.  This film was like driving through Iowa on your way to somewhere interesting, nothing to see the entire trip and then it all comes at once.What is sad, is that it could have been a really, really good film.  Could have been, but wasn't.  I normally frown upon remakes especially of films that aren't that old, but I would love to see this re-made by someone who actually knew what they were doing, because it would be

Pandorum was exciting, disturbing, and had a great ending. This movie is none of the above. It starts with a flashing camera sequence that goes on for about 7 minutes and is likely to give you a migraine. Then we get darkness, jerky camera, and more darkness. The movie is only 98 minutes long, yet by the time it ended I felt like I'd spent five hours in front of the TV. Five very long, dark, and confusing hours.Yes, it's atmospheric and surreal and all that. And that's all it is. The main idea in a nutshell is: humans bad, trees good. Corporations are arrogant and evil and must die. Heck, humans in general are arrogant and evil and must die... The plot is all over the place. The setting is too dark to appreciate. The characters are unsympathetic and unrealistic. For example, at some point the main character runs into a female survivor... And rapes her. Huh?.. Oh, wait. Right. It's to show just how evil we humans are. Unlike those nice, nice trees we abuse. (Except for the little fact that rapists are mentally unstable people, don't represent normal human behavior, or the majority of humans).The ending is every radical environmentalist's wet dream: our hero has a ""revelation"" and condemns the entire humankind to death by letting us all be devoured by a giant tree. This finale is shown in a pretty, sparkling way with pretty music playing, which, I'm guessing, is supposed to signify a happy end... I guess if you believe the garbage these filmmakers seem to believe, then it is a happy end to a great movie. But if you have more faith in the human race than that, not to mention if you expect better storytelling and character development from your movies, then it's a horrible ending to a horrible, ill-conceived, and poorly-executed waste of celluloid.",1,WARNING: SPOILERS.,1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,1876,"['Why', 'movie', 'being', 'compared', 'Pandorum', 'similarity', 'whatsoever', 'have', 'mutants', 'Pandorum', 'was', 'exciting', 'disturbing', 'had', 'great', 'ending', 'movie', 'none', 'above', 'flashing', 'camera', 'sequence', '7', 'minutes', 'likely', 'give', 'migraine', 'Then', 'get', 'darkness', 'jerky', 'camera', 'more', 'darkness', 'movie', 'only', '98', 'minutes', 'long', 'yet', 'time', 'ended', 'felt', ""'d"", 'spent', 'five', 'hours', 'front', 'TV', 'Five', 'very', 'long', 'dark', 'confusing', 'hours.Yes', 'atmospheric', 'surreal', 'main', 'idea', 'nutshell', 'humans', 'bad', 'trees', 'good', 'Corporations', 'are', 'arrogant', 'evil', 'must', 'die', 'Heck', 'humans', 'general', 'are', 'arrogant', 'evil', 'must', 'die', 'plot', 'place', 'setting', 'too', 'dark', 'appreciate', 'characters', 'are', 'unsympathetic', 'unrealistic', 'example', 'point', 'main', 'character', 'female', 'survivor', 'Huh', '..', 'Oh', 'wait', 'Right', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'evil', 'humans', 'are', 'nice', 'nice', 'trees', 'abuse', 'little', 'fact', 'rapists', 'are', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'represent', 'normal', 'human', 'behavior', 'majority', 'humans', '.The', 'ending', 'radical', 'environmentalist', 'wet', 'dream', 'hero', 'revelation', 'condemns', 'entire', 'humankind', 'death', 'letting', 'be', 'devoured', 'giant', 'tree', 'finale', 'shown', 'pretty', 'sparkling', 'way', 'pretty', 'music', 'playing', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'supposed', 'signify', 'happy', 'end', 'guess', 'believe', 'garbage', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'believe', 'then', 'happy', 'end', 'great', 'movie', 'have', 'more', 'faith', 'human', 'race', 'not', 'mention', 'expect', 'better', 'storytelling', 'character', 'development', 'movies', 'then', 'horrible', 'ending', 'horrible', 'ill-conceived', 'poorly-executed', 'waste', 'celluloid']",Eden Log

It must have been hell to get it done in the first place, then edit it into something tangible and viewable. The lighting must have been a serious challenge. The popping light at the beginning drove me nuts initially - and that was the point. The man came up out of the mud, in the pitch black, with light snapping in his face and the idea was to make you feel it. The camera men were probably whispering camera-god-prayers, hoping that nothing bumped or moved the cameras in the dark. Editing the original footage must have been like stalking naked through mud and glass - broken or otherwise. Initially the movie intrigued me and I will watch it again, if for no other reason than to pay the film crew, editor and set designers, homage.

1230622,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B001QDBX6A,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[4, 5]","In the words of a previous reviewer, Eden Log is reminiscent of an old school survival horror videogame.  Our protagonist (Clovis Cornillac) awakens naked covered in muck with no memory of where he is or how he got there, or even who he himself is either.  As the film goes along, we learn along with our protagonist that the strange world he finds himself in is anything but natural, and that he may have more in common with the otherworldly creatures that are making their presence known than he could ever imagine.  Deliberately paced, beautifully shot, and definitely occasionally incoherent and confusing; Eden Log is strangely compelling and magnetic to behold.  A French film originally filmed in 2007, seeing it finally make its way to our shores is a refreshing thing indeed.  Using little dialogue and letting the viewer piece together the proceedings along with the protagonist, director and screenwriter Franck Vestiel crafts a science fiction allegory that displays what the world we live in may in fact one day become.  It may take some time to get into and fully understand, but for what it's worth, Eden Log is a unique and worthwhile trip that is definitely worth taking.",4,"Unique, no other word to describe it",1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,1188,"['words', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'Eden', 'Log', 'reminiscent', 'old', 'school', 'survival', 'horror', 'videogame', 'protagonist', 'Clovis', 'Cornillac', 'naked', 'covered', 'muck', 'memory', 'where', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'even', 'who', 'either', 'film', 'along', 'learn', 'along', 'protagonist', 'strange', 'world', 'anything', 'natural', 'may', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'otherworldly', 'creatures', 'are', 'making', 'presence', 'known', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine', 'Deliberately', 'paced', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'definitely', 'occasionally', 'incoherent', 'confusing', 'Eden', 'Log', 'strangely', 'compelling', 'magnetic', 'behold', 'French', 'film', 'originally', 'filmed', '2007', 'seeing', 'finally', 'make', 'way', 'shores', 'refreshing', 'thing', 'indeed', 'Using', 'little', 'dialogue', 'letting', 'viewer', 'piece', 'together', 'proceedings', 'protagonist', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'Franck', 'Vestiel', 'science', 'fiction', 'allegory', 'what', 'world', 'live', 'may', 'fact', 'one', 'day', 'become', 'may', 'take', 'time', 'get', 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'worth', 'Eden', 'Log', 'unique', 'worthwhile', 'trip', 'definitely', 'worth', 'taking']",Eden Log
1230623,A2OH1ZXME3KZ3N,B001QDBX6A,Nicholas Gold,"[11, 14]","I saw Eden Log recently for the first time, and was so into it I almost immediately ordered a copy on DVD. While I understand that the Blu-ray version has technical shortcomings, my review here relates to the content of the film, both thematically and stylistically.I don't want to give much away, because Eden Log does a great job of slowly unraveling a mysterious story over the course of the film. Toward the end when most things become revealed, I really had that ""Aha!"" moment you get when you realize a great puzzle was being untangled all throughout a story, and the clues that were there all along you were only vaguely understanding. For this reason I think the film merits multiple viewings.The style is very dark and ""dingy"", fairly cyberpunk, but from the sub-sub-sub-basement of a futuristic kind of world perspective. If you've read the Japanese manga series Blame! you will find many similarities to Eden Log. Likewise, the movie borrows from the stylings of French BD sci-fi comics, and this is a great thing, as not enough films do! Perhaps similar in a sense to Immortal by Enki Bilal, which of course itself was his adaptation of his own BD comic.Eden Log definitely is operating on several levels, in addition to the science fiction story itself. It is concerned with the environment and the planet, and how we as humans interact with and seek to control it, and create a feedback loop of negative consequences. It also has themes relating to immigration theory and nationalism/citizenship, and what some people do in order to pursue the dream of being a productive member of a ""free"" and prosperous society -- when in reality this is not what they are necessarily signing up for upon applying for citizenship. Other interesting themes abound as well, and because of all these subtleties I think this movie appeals more to an intellectual crowd.Stylistically, I am extremely impressed by what the filmmakers pulled off with a presumably relatively small budget. Camera work, set design, and costume design are all EXCELLENT, and all serve to illustrate the ""darkness"" of the world of Eden Log. I am impressed by the acting, and even creature design. The movie is very dark, the colors very muted and affected, and the camera work jarring -- but it's all very intentional, and the overall effect I found very appealing.So, maybe Eden Log won't appeal to your average Joe looking for a generic sci-fi horror action thriller -- but that's not the intent of this movie. I'd call it hard science fiction of a very artistic/stylized fashion, with intellectual social themes as an undercurrent. If you like artsy, gritty, dark, heady science fiction, absolutely give this movie a chance.",5,Way better than others give it credit for,1248048000,"07 20, 2009",2009,2700,"['saw', 'Eden', 'Log', 'recently', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'almost', 'immediately', 'ordered', 'copy', 'DVD', 'understand', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'technical', 'shortcomings', 'review', 'here', 'content', 'film', 'thematically', 'stylistically.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'much', 'away', 'Eden', 'Log', 'great', 'job', 'slowly', 'unraveling', 'mysterious', 'story', 'course', 'film', 'end', 'when', 'most', 'things', 'become', 'revealed', 'really', 'had', 'Aha', 'moment', 'get', 'when', 'realize', 'great', 'puzzle', 'was', 'being', 'untangled', 'story', 'clues', 'were', 'all', 'were', 'only', 'vaguely', 'understanding', 'reason', 'think', 'film', 'merits', 'multiple', 'viewings.The', 'style', 'very', 'dark', 'dingy', 'fairly', 'cyberpunk', 'sub-sub-sub-basement', 'futuristic', 'kind', 'world', 'perspective', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Japanese', 'manga', 'series', 'Blame', 'will', 'find', 'many', 'similarities', 'Eden', 'Log', 'Likewise', 'movie', 'stylings', 'French', 'BD', 'sci-fi', 'comics', 'great', 'thing', 'not', 'enough', 'films', 'do', 'Perhaps', 'similar', 'sense', 'Immortal', 'Enki', 'Bilal', 'course', 'was', 'adaptation', 'own', 'BD', 'comic.Eden', 'Log', 'definitely', 'operating', 'several', 'levels', 'addition', 'science', 'fiction', 'story', 'concerned', 'environment', 'planet', 'how', 'humans', 'interact', 'seek', 'control', 'create', 'feedback', 'loop', 'negative', 'consequences', 'also', 'themes', 'relating', 'immigration', 'theory', 'nationalism/citizenship', 'what', 'people', 'do', 'order', 'pursue', 'dream', 'being', 'productive', 'member', 'free', 'prosperous', 'society', 'when', 'reality', 'not', 'what', 'are', 'necessarily', 'signing', 'up', 'applying', 'citizenship', 'Other', 'interesting', 'themes', 'abound', 'as', 'well', 'subtleties', 'think', 'movie', 'appeals', 'more', 'intellectual', 'crowd.Stylistically', 'am', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'pulled', 'off', 'presumably', 'relatively', 'small', 'budget', 'Camera', 'work', 'set', 'design', 'costume', 'design', 'are', 'EXCELLENT', 'serve', 'illustrate', 'darkness', 'world', 'Eden', 'Log', 'am', 'impressed', 'acting', 'even', 'creature', 'design', 'movie', 'very', 'dark', 'colors', 'very', 'muted', 'affected', 'camera', 'work', 'jarring', 'very', 'intentional', 'overall', 'effect', 'found', 'very', 'appealing.So', 'maybe', 'Eden', 'Log', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'average', 'Joe', 'looking', 'generic', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'action', 'thriller', 'not', 'intent', 'movie', ""'d"", 'call', 'hard', 'science', 'fiction', 'very', 'artistic/stylized', 'fashion', 'intellectual', 'social', 'themes', 'undercurrent', 'like', 'artsy', 'gritty', 'dark', 'heady', 'science', 'fiction', 'absolutely', 'give', 'movie', 'chance']",Eden Log

Now, the subjective part is that you have to like it, which is a personal reaction.  I believed the characters from the very beginning and was intrigued with finding out what was really going on, which I would never have predicted.  It kept my interest and I found it intellectually stimulating.  However, it is not for everyone.  The pace is static, much of it remains obscure, and the symbolism does get a bit heavy.A man wakes up in a cold, wet cave.  Without memory, he seems to do alright going around by instinct, searching for something or some way out.  He has a number of disturbing encounters, from a man seemingly permanently entangled in a tree, to monsters, scientists, and military types.  He painstakingly elicits bits of information at each encounter, all the time running from forces that are pressing on him.  He is also going through some kind of transformation.  What is so French about it is the pessimism, lack of hope, and simple obscurity of the situation and action, which you would never see from Hollywood.As so many have given their interpretations, I will allude to some of mine, hopefully without spoilers.  It appears that he is in some kind of giant industrial complex, almost an experiment.  Much of it has gone awry, it appears, but there is a system that works.  In the future, it seems, humans are attempting to harness botanic processes, though not with the results they had hoped.  There is the x-factor as well, as the amnesiac man seems to be carrying some kind of esoteric knowledge or capacity.I don't go in for the biblical interpretations, which I believe require the viewer to twist things too much.

Watching the first hour or so of this film reminded me of the first time I played the original Resident Evil on Playstation (we're talking the original game which was brilliant... not those hacky movies they made based on the game). There is this feeling of discovery you get while watching; you know there is this huge overarching mystery but you can't quite put your finger on what exactly it is.I really enjoyed watching this, but even though I enjoyed it there are a couple things I must say that detract from the movie. First off it is just so dark, towards the end of the movie I found myself hoping we'd get just a little more light so I could see what was going on a little better... that being said this probably also added to the claustraphobic vibe, so I can see why they did it this way. Secondly I think the last quarter of the film was the weakest part of the movie, and it ended (for me at least) somewhat anticlimactic. I kept expecting a really brilliant moment of clarity in regards to the story, but what I got was something somewhat muddled that confuses the heck out of me. In fact as I'm writing this I still don't think I truly understand the overall plot of the film (thank God for IMDB message boards).So all this being said, its the challenge of this film that is fun and makes it a good experience... and one that I'm glad I sat through. I wish more films took chances like this one, even if all the chances didn't pay off as much as I'd hoped. 3.5/5 stars.",4,"Great, but could have been classic...",1294358400,"01 7, 2011",2011,1661,"[""'m"", 'going', 'make', 'comparison', 'here', 'only', 'few', 'select', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'think', 'describe', 'feeling', 'film', 'Watching', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'film', 'reminded', 'first', 'time', 'played', 'original', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Playstation', ""'re"", 'talking', 'original', 'game', 'was', 'brilliant', 'not', 'hacky', 'movies', 'made', 'based', 'game', 'feeling', 'discovery', 'get', 'watching', 'know', 'huge', 'overarching', 'mystery', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'what', 'exactly', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'even', 'enjoyed', 'are', 'couple', 'things', 'must', 'say', 'detract', 'movie', 'First', 'just', 'so', 'dark', 'end', 'movie', 'found', 'hoping', ""'d"", 'get', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'light', 'could', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'little', 'better', 'being', 'said', 'probably', 'also', 'added', 'claustraphobic', 'vibe', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'did', 'way', 'Secondly', 'think', 'last', 'quarter', 'film', 'was', 'weakest', 'part', 'movie', 'ended', 'least', 'somewhat', 'anticlimactic', 'kept', 'expecting', 'really', 'brilliant', 'moment', 'clarity', 'regards', 'story', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'something', 'somewhat', 'muddled', 'heck', 'fact', ""'m"", 'writing', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'truly', 'understand', 'overall', 'plot', 'film', 'thank', 'God', 'IMDB', 'message', 'boards', '.So', 'being', 'said', 'challenge', 'film', 'fun', 'good', 'experience', 'one', ""'m"", 'glad', 'sat', 'wish', 'more', 'films', 'took', 'chances', 'one', 'even', 'chances', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'off', 'as', 'much', ""'d"", 'hoped', '3.5/5', 'stars']",Eden Log
