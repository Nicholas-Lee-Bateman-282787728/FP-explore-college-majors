Kim Cattrall (Sex in the City) and Joan Cusack are very enjoyable as protective mothers with very different instincts about feminism and playing to win.

But after seeing it, I've only begun to remember the ridiculousness in disney movies, but even the Princess Diary wasn't as ridiculous.first of, I don't care HOW TALENTED YOU ARE, a few months training CAN NOT, and I repeat CAN. NOT. make you master the triple jumps, in fact, they take a LIFETIME of ANY figure skater to master, this I find soley annoying. 2. any figure skating fan who watches figure skating constantly can see that Michell T just can't skate well, I mean, 'course she's good for someone who isn't a renouned figure skater, but even when she skates you can see her body is very tense and hard, not someone who has ""natural talent"" and graceful movements, the star of the show is the jumping shrimp, and alot of the other skaters who are obvious real skaters, not some actor who tries to skate but did her best, and got silver, gosh I have a big hard time believing that, and Michell Kwon too, you can feel the anger and annoyance in her voice. But what do they make up for that? yeah, she MAGICALLY did the triple jumps, I think this movie'll make any figure skater/figure skater fan really angryOther than that would be the annoying disney formula: OF COURSE parents can never understand their kids, OF COURSE skating is more glamorous than school, and OF COURSE the science geeks don't have a life and they dress geek-ish. And yeah, one more thing: of course it's either Harvard or skating, GOD knows you can't do both!!! YEAH RIGHT, if she really won silver at such competition it won't matter, Harvard would LET her in non-the-less, and lots of athelets are honor students.and what else? yeah, the physics, like tucking yourself in DECREASES the moment of inertia, NOT increase, common writer, DO some research at least!!! And everything else she talked about are simple Newtonian laws and equations, nothing impressive or advance as the book she's sleeping on in class- which is an AP physics book- I took the class, I knowthey've only done two things right: 1. the blond girl isn't evil- THANK GOD! 2. she won silver with her fall- at least that's less fake, along with everything else...If you are under 12 you'll like this movie better, if not, avoid, especially if you love figure skating.",2,"WOW, people REALLY love happy happy endings to give this movie a 4 star rating",1167350400,"12 29, 2006",2006,2361,"['expected', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'movie', '1.', 'figure', 'skating', 'favorite', 'sport', '2.', 'disney', 'fun', 'happy', 'endings', 'YAY', 'seeing', ""'ve"", 'only', 'begun', 'remember', 'ridiculousness', 'disney', 'movies', 'even', 'Princess', 'Diary', 'was', ""n't"", 'ridiculous.first', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'HOW', 'TALENTED', 'YOU', 'ARE', 'few', 'months', 'training', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'repeat', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'make', 'master', 'triple', 'jumps', 'fact', 'take', 'LIFETIME', 'ANY', 'figure', 'skater', 'master', 'find', 'soley', 'annoying', '2.', 'figure', 'skating', 'fan', 'who', 'figure', 'skating', 'constantly', 'can', 'see', 'Michell', 'T', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'skate', 'well', 'mean', 'good', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'renouned', 'figure', 'skater', 'even', 'when', 'can', 'see', 'body', 'very', 'tense', 'hard', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'natural', 'talent', 'graceful', 'movements', 'star', 'show', 'jumping', 'shrimp', 'alot', 'other', 'skaters', 'who', 'are', 'obvious', 'real', 'skaters', 'not', 'actor', 'who', 'skate', 'did', 'best', 'got', 'silver', 'gosh', 'have', 'big', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'Michell', 'Kwon', 'too', 'can', 'feel', 'anger', 'annoyance', 'voice', 'what', 'do', 'make', 'up', 'yeah', 'MAGICALLY', 'did', 'triple', 'jumps', 'think', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'make', 'figure', 'skater/figure', 'skater', 'fan', 'really', 'angryOther', 'would', 'be', 'annoying', 'disney', 'formula', 'OF', 'COURSE', 'parents', 'can', 'never', 'understand', 'kids', 'OF', 'COURSE', 'skating', 'more', 'glamorous', 'school', 'OF', 'COURSE', 'science', 'geeks', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'life', 'dress', 'geek-ish', 'yeah', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'course', 'Harvard', 'skating', 'GOD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'YEAH', 'RIGHT', 'really', 'won', 'silver', 'such', 'competition', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Harvard', 'would', 'LET', 'non-the-less', 'lots', 'athelets', 'are', 'honor', 'students.and', 'what', 'else', 'yeah', 'physics', 'tucking', 'DECREASES', 'moment', 'inertia', 'NOT', 'increase', 'common', 'writer', 'DO', 'research', 'least', 'everything', 'else', 'talked', 'about', 'are', 'simple', 'Newtonian', 'laws', 'equations', 'nothing', 'impressive', 'advance', 'book', 'sleeping', 'class-', 'AP', 'physics', 'book-', 'took', 'class', 'knowthey', ""'ve"", 'only', 'done', 'two', 'things', 'right', '1.', 'blond', 'girl', ""n't"", 'evil-', 'THANK', 'GOD', '2.', 'won', 'silver', 'fall-', 'least', 'less', 'fake', 'everything', 'else', 'are', '12', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', 'better', 'not', 'avoid', 'especially', 'love', 'figure', 'skating']",N/A

906528,A3EW2L59UBHQSG,B0009JE57G,Bruce Aguilar,"[1, 2]","Girls will love this film.  How couldn't they what with the ice skating, romance, rooting for the under dog and mothers who don't understand their daughters?  What's really surprising is that other family members are equally likely to be enchanted by Ice Princess.Why?  Well, Ice Princess is a very solid family film.  Sure the movie is predictable and it's yet another film where the heroine chooses the princess role over the more practical yet less glamorous role of professional independent yet it remains somehow compelling.  Most of the charm is courtesy of the talented Michelle Trachtenberg who is extremely likable.  But the rest of the cast pulls off their roles with aplomb as well.  Both Joan Cusack and Kim Cattral are convincing as a mothers who want the best for their daughters but go about it in the wrong ways.Along with the winning performances, what makes this film stand out from it's peers is the writing.  We're given characters who do not play the typical roles.  The one we think is going to be the villain turns out to be a true friend, the good-hearted trainer turns out to have ulterior motives.  They're small deviations, but they make the conventions seem a bit more fresh.Typically for a family film, the bonus features are mostly forgettable.  The cast commentary in particular should be avoided at all costs if you don't want to subject  yourself to endless squeals of joy and exclamations of ""Oh that's cool.""  A few of the deleted scenes (one in particular) shed some light on other directions the director was considering.  They are the most illuminating of the bonus features.Bottom line:  If your family liked the recent Freaky Friday remake, you'll most likely enjoy Ice Princess as well.  Ice Princess is the kind of film Disney should be making more of.

906529,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B0009JE57G,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[3, 4]","Disney and family films are two things that go hand in hand. We can always count on the company Walt founded to produce some good, quality entertainment each year and it often releases a few full- length movies each season with a family- oriented theme. ""Ice Princess"" is a film made for kids and while it isn't necessarily a bad movie, it certainly doesn't measure up to some of Disney's better works.The main problem I have with this movie is its total simplicity. The plot is basic and predictable: A girl daydreams about becoming a star ice skater; fantasizes as she watches other skaters; determines to go for her dream; encounters some resistance from parents; and finally achieves her dream in the end. You already know what will happen after the first fifteen minutes.Because this film is aimed at the 12 and under child market (female more than male) it doesn't have much substance. There are no twists to the plot, no major crises, no huge conflicts or barriers to overcome, etc. Even the main character's mother offers very little resistance to her daughter's choice for a new career. She wants her little girl to become an academic scholar at Harvard, but changes her mind very fast. It's a little unrealistic and it makes for a dull motion picture.Kim Cattrall plays the coach in this movie and I found her to be quite good and believable. This is a very different role for Cattrall who is best known for her stint as television's sultry Samantha Jones. But Catrrall alone cannot save this movie. It is recommended only for those with young daughters in the home.

Overall, she and her mother, and the girl whom she eventually becomes friends with, are all driven by a sense of right and of being fair. Some of the other mothers, girls, and coaches exhibit cheating and some mild bullying, but there is redemption for the major case of this through the girls' drive to do the right thing. Main character Casey does forsake Harvard and her mother's dream for ice skating (her own dream), but in her reasons for doing so, she doesn't trivialize school and education, and she does emphasize art and finding what she in particular is passionate about. There is a teeny bit of sweet teen romance, involving a few kisses, but all the characters concerned are high school seniors, and Casey and her boy show care and kindness more than affection toward each other, so I would say it's alright for even younger girls. The mom-and-daughter drama is dramatically tense but never creates a climate of total disrespect from the children.

In fact, she just about carried the whole film on her shoulders as I didn't really see anyone in this film get past the after-school-special acting grade.I really liked the script for this movie.  It was believable, fun to watch unfold on screen, and different from anything that I had seen before.  I currently have teenage daughters who are both trying to decide what they are going to do after high school, so I can relate to the stress Casey's mother must have felt when Casey made a dramatic change in her plans.This movie does a good job of dealing with the stress we all feel in life; which passion will we follow, and is it the right passion?  This movie also addresses the pressure put upon child athletes by their coaches and parents - while it can be healthy at times it can also be very destructive.  Casey's mom wants a better life for her daughter, as most moms do, but she also loves her daughter enough to - in the end - let her make the decision that will forever change her life.I saw this movie as an example of how parents try and guide their children as best they can, but it is eventually up to the children to make decisions based on experience and their own character.As I stated earlier, Trachtenberg carried the acting in this film.  Her facial expression, dialogue delivery, and bearing were well beyond her years.  She has that ""it"" factor that all of Hollywood is after.  I plan on purchasing this DVD very soon.  I think it is one that people will want to watch every few years.This is a good movie that I recommend.See ya next review!",5,A Classy Movie With A Great Performance By Michelle Trachtenberg!,1122249600,"07 25, 2005",2005,1698,"['Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Casey', 'Carlyle', 'math', 'science', 'geek', 'turned', 'adorable', 'skating', 'champion', 'fact', 'just', 'about', 'carried', 'whole', 'film', 'shoulders', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'anyone', 'film', 'get', 'after-school-special', 'acting', 'grade.I', 'really', 'liked', 'script', 'movie', 'was', 'believable', 'fun', 'watch', 'unfold', 'screen', 'different', 'anything', 'had', 'seen', 'currently', 'have', 'teenage', 'daughters', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'decide', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'high', 'school', 'can', 'relate', 'stress', 'Casey', 'mother', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'when', 'Casey', 'made', 'dramatic', 'change', 'plans.This', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'dealing', 'stress', 'feel', 'life', 'passion', 'will', 'follow', 'right', 'passion', 'movie', 'also', 'pressure', 'put', 'child', 'athletes', 'coaches', 'parents', 'can', 'be', 'healthy', 'times', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'very', 'destructive', 'Casey', 'mom', 'better', 'life', 'daughter', 'most', 'moms', 'do', 'also', 'daughter', 'enough', 'end', 'let', 'make', 'decision', 'will', 'forever', 'change', 'life.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'example', 'how', 'parents', 'try', 'guide', 'children', 'best', 'can', 'eventually', 'up', 'children', 'make', 'decisions', 'based', 'experience', 'own', 'character.As', 'stated', 'earlier', 'Trachtenberg', 'carried', 'acting', 'film', 'facial', 'expression', 'dialogue', 'delivery', 'bearing', 'were', 'well', 'years', 'factor', 'Hollywood', 'plan', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'very', 'soon', 'think', 'one', 'people', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'few', 'years.This', 'good', 'movie', 'recommend.See', 'ya', 'next', 'review']",N/A
906534,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0009JE57G,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[55, 59]","It's amazing that the wonderfully brutal sport of hockey and the graceful sport of ice skating take place on the same surface - it took a while, but I've actually come to appreciate the sport of figure skating (well, women's figure skating, anyway).  Ice Princess, naturally enough, is all about figure skating - but it's really about so much more than that: pursuing a dream, doing what you love, having the courage to take chances and make big decisions, dealing with parental pressure at its best and worst, competing with honor, and basically just figuring out what you want and taking control of your own life - and, yes, it's also about Michelle Trachtenberg looking absolutely gorgeous.  Disney always puts out good films; Ice Princess is fairly predictable, but there's nothing wrong with a predictable story that inspires you and makes you feel good - and the film actually isn't quite as predictable as I thought it would be.Michelle Trachtenberg plays Casey Carlyle, a science geek who loves skating out on the pond but is focused on winning a physics scholarship to Harvard.  The story doesn't really work the high school misfit angle very hard, but it's not really the focus of the movie, anyway.  Casey needs to come up with a personalized physics project to impress the Harvard recruiters, and so it is that she turns to ice skating with all of its angles, velocities, vectors, and mathematical implications as her ticket to achievement.  It's not enough to watch and study the skaters training under the local coach Tina Harwood (Crow T. Robot's favorite actress, Kim Cattrall), though; she begins taking skating lessons herself (surrounded by much younger, competitive little students) to put her theories to the test, and she discovers she has some real talent.  Before long, she's actually competing in sectionals - where she discovers just how cut-throat the figure skating profession can be.  Standing at the first major crossroads of her life, Casey has to choose whether she will give up skating and go out and get that Harvard scholarship or if she will make the sacrifices necessary in order to see just how far she can go in the sport.  Her mother and her coach complicate things.  Casey's mother Joan (Joan Cusack) has always dreamed of her daughter matriculating at Harvard and finding lifelong success by using her brilliant mind, and she can't understand why Casey would even think about putting her academic future in jeopardy by pursuing what she sees as an impossible dream.  Casey's coach, Tina, has always pushed her own daughter to succeed at figure skating, and she's rather ruthless about making that dream of hers come true - although it's really not what her daughter wants for herself.  Joan and Tina could not be more different - yet in time we see they are surprisingly alike in terms of pushing their own dreams onto their daughters.  It's a theme that any past, present, or future teenager knows well.  In the end, Casey takes charge of her own life, risking not only Harvard but her close relationship with her mother.  It may or may not be the best choice, but it is definitely the right choice for Casey.The figure skating scenes are really well-done; a lot of the difficult moves are actually performed by doubles, but you'd never know it by watching the movie.  You would also never know that two of the actresses are really skaters with no previous acting experience.  The whole transformation of Casey from science geek novice on skates to medal-contending skater would never happen in the real world, nor would the actual competitions resemble those in the movie, but the film's story comes across as very believable.  There's also a sweet touch of light romance on the side.  It's a feel-good story that inspires you to pursue your own dreams, whatever they may be, and I enjoyed it immensely.The DVD comes with some nice little extras.  First, you have a number of deleted scenes, including a different opening to the film - one of these deleted scenes is quite interesting, for it would have put a much different spin on concluding events.  Second, you have a couple of good music videos (Reach by Caleigh Peters and No One by Aly and A.J.) featuring plenty of shots from the film.  The whole soundtrack of the film is excellent, by the way.  Finally, you have an excellent commentary featuring four of the young actors.  Most film commentaries tend to be extremely boring and surprisingly uninformative, but the commentary here is full of details and insight on the making of the film and is really a lot of fun to listen to because of the passion and fun these young stars bring to the whole experience of making the film.  It would appear that Disney has done it again: Ice Princess is a wonderful film that is both fun and rewarding for viewers of all ages.",5,Even the Russian judge should give this film high

906539,A3H82LUT1EC655,B0009JE57G,Erika Sorocco,"[0, 0]","High school Senior, Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg) longs to be an ice princess, but due to her gawky body, and not enough money for ice skating lessons, she has had to settle for being a science geek. The brainy girl who gets perfect grades, but never has much fun. But all that is about to change. When Casey is given the opportunity to win a Physics Scholarship to Harvard by throwing herself head-first into a project on the ice, she realizes that even with her feminist mother's (Joan Cusack) pushing and prodding, there are more important things than being the best at school. Like having fun on the ice. So Casey discovers a mathematical formula that helps her figure out just how her fellow classmates are doing those tricky stunts, and quickly follows her own instructions to become as graceful on the ice as them. Of course, she soon realizes that she can't go it alone, and enlists the help of some nice-girl skaters, as well as a coach who can show her the ropes to win.When I heard that one of my favorite authors, Meg Cabot (author of THE PRINCESS DIARIES) was penning the script for this film, I knew that I couldn't miss it. Luckily, I was not in any way disappointed. Michelle Trachtenberg (HARRIET THE SPY and INSPECTOR GADGET) is wonderful as brainiac Casey; and Joan Cusack (RAISING HELEN and SCHOOL OF ROCK) is very convincing as a mother who only wants the best for her daughter, even if it means pushing her away. However, in my opinion, I feel that the performances by Kim Cattrall (SEX AND THE CITY and CROSSROADS), as well as her on-screen daughter Hayden Panettiere (RAISING HELEN and RACING STRIPES) stole the movie. Cattrall could not be more perfect in her role of a pushy, demanding skating coach; and Panettiere is amazing in her role as the reluctant skater who wants to spend her time hanging out with her boyfriend, and eating junk food, which is totally different from what she has spent her time doing over the years. Then there's Casey's love interest, Trevor Blumas (GUILT BY ASSOCIATION and THE UNSAID) who is every girls fantasy, as the nice guy who drives the zamboni.Throughout the film, viewers are treated to splendid ice action that will leave everyone's head spinning. We also get to see guest appearances from some professional skaters, such as Michelle Kwan, playing herself. As well as Kirsten Olson (playing Nikki) also known as ""The Jumping Shrimp,"" because she jumps in all of her performances. Quite high, I might add; and Juliana Cannarozzo (playing Zoe Bloch) a girl who truly rocks out on the ice. The performances seen in this movie, both on the ice and off, will please the whole family, from the youngest member to the oldest member, and may even have your children begging to become the next Ice Princess. Overall, this was an enjoyable movie that is more of a drama that should be watched with the whole family, than a great pre-teen/teen comedy that should be watched with your pals. For you'll find yourself shedding more tears during this film than chuckling aloud.Erika SoroccoFreelance ReviewerBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper",4,Ice Dreams Do Come True...,1124928000,"08 25, 2005",2005,3122,"['High', 'school', 'Senior', 'Casey', 'Carlyle', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'be', 'ice', 'princess', 'due', 'gawky', 'body', 'not', 'enough', 'money', 'ice', 'skating', 'lessons', 'had', 'settle', 'being', 'science', 'geek', 'brainy', 'girl', 'who', 'perfect', 'grades', 'never', 'much', 'fun', 'change', 'When', 'Casey', 'given', 'opportunity', 'win', 'Physics', 'Scholarship', 'Harvard', 'throwing', 'head-first', 'project', 'ice', 'even', 'feminist', 'mother', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'pushing', 'prodding', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'things', 'being', 'best', 'school', 'having', 'fun', 'ice', 'So', 'Casey', 'discovers', 'mathematical', 'formula', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'fellow', 'classmates', 'are', 'doing', 'tricky', 'stunts', 'quickly', 'own', 'instructions', 'become', 'graceful', 'ice', 'course', 'soon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'alone', 'help', 'nice-girl', 'skaters', 'as', 'well', 'coach', 'who', 'can', 'show', 'ropes', 'win.When', 'heard', 'one', 'favorite', 'authors', 'Meg', 'Cabot', 'author', 'THE', 'PRINCESS', 'DIARIES', 'was', 'penning', 'script', 'film', 'knew', 'could', ""n't"", 'miss', 'Luckily', 'was', 'not', 'way', 'disappointed', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'HARRIET', 'THE', 'SPY', 'INSPECTOR', 'GADGET', 'wonderful', 'brainiac', 'Casey', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'RAISING', 'HELEN', 'SCHOOL', 'OF', 'ROCK', 'very', 'convincing', 'mother', 'who', 'only', 'best', 'daughter', 'even', 'pushing', 'away', 'However', 'opinion', 'feel', 'performances', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'SEX', 'THE', 'CITY', 'CROSSROADS', 'as', 'well', 'on-screen', 'daughter', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'RAISING', 'HELEN', 'RACING', 'STRIPES', 'stole', 'movie', 'Cattrall', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'perfect', 'role', 'pushy', 'demanding', 'skating', 'coach', 'Panettiere', 'amazing', 'role', 'reluctant', 'skater', 'who', 'spend', 'time', 'hanging', 'out', 'boyfriend', 'eating', 'junk', 'food', 'totally', 'different', 'what', 'spent', 'time', 'doing', 'years', 'Then', 'Casey', 'love', 'interest', 'Trevor', 'Blumas', 'GUILT', 'BY', 'ASSOCIATION', 'THE', 'UNSAID', 'who', 'girls', 'fantasy', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'zamboni.Throughout', 'film', 'viewers', 'are', 'treated', 'splendid', 'ice', 'action', 'will', 'leave', 'everyone', 'head', 'spinning', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'guest', 'appearances', 'professional', 'skaters', 'such', 'Michelle', 'Kwan', 'playing', 'As', 'well', 'Kirsten', 'Olson', 'playing', 'Nikki', 'also', 'known', 'Jumping', 'Shrimp', 'performances', 'Quite', 'high', 'might', 'add', 'Juliana', 'Cannarozzo', 'playing', 'Zoe', 'Bloch', 'girl', 'who', 'truly', 'out', 'ice', 'performances', 'seen', 'movie', 'ice', 'off', 'will', 'please', 'whole', 'family', 'youngest', 'member', 'oldest', 'member', 'may', 'even', 'have', 'children', 'begging', 'become', 'next', 'Ice', 'Princess', 'Overall', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'more', 'drama', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'whole', 'family', 'great', 'pre-teen/teen', 'comedy', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'pals', ""'ll"", 'find', 'shedding', 'more', 'tears', 'film', 'chuckling', 'aloud.Erika', 'SoroccoFreelance', 'ReviewerBook', 'Review', 'Columnist', 'Community', 'Bugle', 'Newspaper']",N/A

906542,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0009JE57G,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","ICE PRINCESS is not the kind of movie to which this reviewer is usually attracted - the trappings indicate that we are in for a happy-wappy, sterilized, PG, Disney candybox. But, surprise!,  here is a film that is  better than its package.  Writers Meg Cabot and Hadley Davis have combined the sport of ice skating with the drama of teenage angst and come up with a credible tale of a 'science geek' discovering her talent and following her dream of figure skating.Director Tim Fywell knows his way around the ice rink and the halls and lockers of high school kids and his preparation for the film is apparent.  Casey (Michelle Trachtenberg) is a fine student who is encouraged by her physics professor to find a project that incorporates her personality along with physics that will assist her in gaining a scholarship to Harvard.  Casey's mother (Joan Cusack) is a pragmatist, a schoolteacher who wants Casey to succeed beyond the mother's status.  Casey loves to skate on their home pond, but one day happens into a private skating rink class owned by one-time star skater Tina (Kim Cattrall), a place where Tina relentlessly drives her daughter Gen (Hayden Panettiere) toward winning prizes.  Tina's son Teddy (Trevor Blumas - a much underused handsome actor) is always around to keep the ice surfaces smooth with his machine.Casey observes the brilliance of fine skating, thinks of a way to analyze moves on her computer that will diagnose aerodynamic physics aspects of skating, and once that is perfected, and she is able to aid the skaters with her scientific knowledge, she personalizes her theories. Before long has won a place along with the other aspiring skaters.  She encounters resistance from her mother, encouragement from Tina, and friendship from Gen and her fellow skaters as well as the eye of Teddy!  When Casey has her Harvard interview, she admits that her real love is for skating, not physics, and commits to pursuing that love full time.  The rest is predictable: all's well that end's well.What sets this little film apart is the quality of acting from Trachtenberg, Cattrall, Cusack and Blumas: they create characters about whom we care.  The skating is fun to watch, and the 'sitting in the bleachers rooting for the good guys' feeling is refreshing.  This is not a great film but certainly one of the best of this genre.  It is most definitely a 'feel good' popcorn movie!

906543,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0009JE57G,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[0, 0]","Casey Carlyle, (played by the talented and engaging Michelle Trachtenberg), is a gifted high school junior who excels in physics and dreams of continuing her education at Harvard after graduation. Her teacher proposes that she compete for a coveted science scholarship, and asks her come up with an original idea for her summer project which reflects her as a well-rounded individual. He wants Casey to impress the Ivy Leaguers and the scholarship board. Casey can certainly use the money. She lives with her mother, (Joan Cusack), a feminist university professor who grew up in a time when women had far fewer opportunities, academically and professionally, than they do today, especially in math and science. The Carlyles have limited finances, and tuition at Harvard is not cheap!Casey also loves to skate, and one of her favorite activities is to figure skate on a small pond, near her home, that freezes-over each winter. She comes up with an idea for her science project while thinking about the sport. She will demonstrate how laws of kinetic energy apply to figure skating. While videotaping athletes at the local rink, Casey comes into contact with former Olympic hopeful, Tina Harwood, (Kim Cattrall), who now instructs youngsters who have dreams of becoming gold medal champions. Harwood is also a ""skating mom,"" who pushes her daughter endlessly and ruthlessly to dedicate her life to the sport. Gen Harwood, (Hayden Panettiere), one of the school's most popular girls, likes skating, but is nowhere near as dedicated or as ambitious as Tina would like her to be.Meanwhile, Casey believes that the ""personal touch"" her physics teacher talked about, is missing from her project, so she takes to the ice herself. She enters Harwood's beginners' class and after demonstrating raw talent, Tina agrees to coach her. Casey convinces her appalled mom, who thinks skating costumes, ""the twinkly little outfits,"" are demeaning to women, that her efforts are for the good of science. Oh, and Teddy Harwood, (Trevor Blumas), Tina's handsome Zamboni driving son, begins to take more of an interest in the new skater also. The two make a cool couple, and the material is fine for preadolescent audiences.I found ""Ice Princess"" to be a refreshingly intelligent film that everyone in the family can enjoy. Its emphasizes that girls can do well in science and math, and that a young women can be extremely smart and still be graceful and attractive - there are no dork stereotypes here. The movie also depicts the hardships athletes go through in order to compete at high levels - not just in rigorous physical training, but in sacrifice of personal time, social activities, special and limited diet, and the high cost in dollars of most sports, with equipment, coaching, costumes/uniforms, etc.The pushy parent syndrome is also depicted, and NOT prettily. I don't know which is worse, those folks who sacrifice to allow their kids to compete athletically, and then lay on the guilt to push the teens to the max, or the intellectual feminist tofu-eating mom who has her daughter's life mapped out for her, living it vicariously. Fortunately, Joan Cusack has the humor and lightness of touch to pull off her role without being too unlikable. And Kim Cattrall does very well as the ex-diva, flinty-eyed skating coach, although I can still spot sly Samantha from ""Sex in the City"" in the G-rated twinkle in her eyes.I love to watch figure skating so was easily induced to watch ""Ice Princess,"" (not my usual film fare), with a friend's daughter. Olympians Michelle Kwan and Brian Boitano make cameo appearances here as sports commentators, and top notch skaters double for the actresses with the more difficult jumps and routines. I was most impressed by lead Michelle Trachtenberg, who had no professional skating experience before she began filming. Apparently, she spent months in intense training sessions learning to figure skate. Some of her fellow competitors, like the punk skater and ""the Jumping Shrimp,"" (Kirsten Olson), are stand-outs.Author Meg Cabot, (""Princess Diaries""), co-wrote the intelligent screenplay with Hadley Davis. British director Tim Fywell  was drawn to the underlying theme of ""a girl's empowerment."" He stated, ""This story is about the way that teens need to discover their own dreams, not their parent's dreams or the dreams they think they are supposed to have.""

906548,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0009JE57G,Joe Sherry,"[1, 2]","Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg) is a science geek.  There is no simpler way to say it.  She is an excellent student who gets straight A's and her physics teacher believes that she has the chance to gain a major physics scholarship.  To make the most of this chance she needs to spend the summer before her senior year of high school working on a project which demonstrates a practical application of physics and her teacher suggests that she ""makes it personal"".  Casey may be a science geek, but the earliest scenes of the movie show Casey gracefully skating on a pond near her home.  Inspiration for her physics project hits while watching a skating competition on television with a friend.  Casey realizes there has to be a mathematical formula for the jumps and spins performed by a skater and this can be used to help improve the form of a skater.Casey goes to the Harwood Skate Center run by Tina Harwood (Kim Cattrall) a former world class skater.  After a brief bump in the road, Casey is allowed to film Tina's skaters and work on her science project.  After Casey thinks she has her work figured out she goes to the rink with a friend to film her practical application.  She attempts to land a jump and amazingly enough, she does, and with perfect form.  Casey begins taking lessons from Tina and starts focusing more on skating than on her studies.  It becomes something of an obsession, much to the dismay of her mother Joan (Joan Cusack), who is much more into intellectual pursuits and is something of a feminist.  Casey, however, is starting to pursue her dream of seeing how far she can go in figure skating.Much of this movie is fairly standard stuff.  Whatever obstacles are placed in Casey's way will be overcome with some pluck and perseverance.  There is a boy to impress.  Casey is something of the ""ugly duckling"" of her school because of her brains and how she starts babbling about science when gets nervous.  There are moments, particularly in the skating scenes, that we fully expect to see and we are not disappointed.  Somehow, though, there is enough charm and realism and good performances that ""Ice Princess"" works.  Michelle Trachtenberg does a very fine job as Casey and makes her a believable student as well as skater.  I'm sure a double is used, but very often it looks like Trachtenberg herself skating.  The movie also avoids several cliches by having a popular student (Hayden Pannettiere) who snubs Casey early on also be Tina's daughter and a skater.  But Gen befriends Casey when they finally have something in common and it turns out that Gen is a decent person and not the standard snob that I expected when the character was first introduced.The DVD contains a series of deleted scenes which are pleasant enough, but do not add to our understanding of the characters or make the movie work better.  There are two music videos, and a commentary track featuring some of the kids who were in the movie.  As far as special features go, this is pretty standard and is probably worth watching just once.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by ""Ice Princess"".  I thought it was going to be horrible to watch and I was very wrong.  I am as far from the target audience as you can get (a 26 year old  male), but enjoyed the movie.  It's not great or deeply original, but it is very pleasant.  It is a true family film and I suspect that the teenage and pre-teen girls will love it.

So be forewarned.Having said that, this one is much better than the average predictable ice skating movie. Yes, it has the young skater who has to overcome all sorts of hardships before she ""makes it"" as a winning skater. Yes, it has the mother who doesn't want her to keep skating and doesn't believe strongly enough in her daughter's talent. Yes, you can tell where it is going before it gets there...most of the time.But somehow it still held my attention. Here's what makes it work:1. Michelle Trachtenberg. A talented actress (who really shone in her small but crucial role in the Buffy series on television), she seems to have only gotten better as an actress over time. More importantly, she seems to understand the allure, glamour and aura that surrounds skating and her passion for the sport is believable. Without her fine performance, this movie would lose much of its zing.2. A decent script, even if it isn't highly original. It still tugs at the heart strings.3. A movie that works for those who never lost their love of ice skating.

She's two parts Physics whiz and one part dreamer.  When she decides to find a formula that explains how ice skaters manage to pull off some of their stunts, Casey finds herself wanting to participate on the ice.First she joins up with some little kids, but after a little encouragement from the judge's panel, she decides to pursue her dream of becoming a skater and sloughs off her mother's dream of her going to Harvard.  Her mother, played well by Joan Cusack, wants her daughter to have everything that she never did.  She doesn't, however, want her to waste her time on ice skating.  Kim Cattrall proves that she can play more than a ""Sex In The City"" floozy by turning in a solid performance as Trachtenberg's ill-willed coach.The rest of the cast is very strong, from Cattrall's daughter and son to the ""Jumping Shrimp,"" everyone does well.  The on-ice action is well executed.  The plot is sugary sweet, but Trachtenberg handles the saccharin well here, and I didn't grow tired of watching it.This is an excellent family film.  It's one of a couple of Disney live-action flicks that have impressed me as of late, the other being ""Sky High.""  The language is minimal and there is no violence at all.  It's a good story of a dreamer being pulled in one direction by a well-meaning parent and tugged in the other direction by a desire to be in the spotlight.

It's a good way to relax and get that fairy tale ending. I think the problem is that people are expecting this to be an award-winning film, especially since it'sMichelle Trachtenberg's first major role. Now, I adore Michelle and think that she's a good actress. However, if you're expecting an award-winning movie, then don't see this.This is good for people who like the 'Princess Diaries' series, you know that kind of thing. It's a bit cheesy and extremely fluffy romantic-wise. But come on, who the heck cares? I really liked it. I think they did a good job showing how hard it is to be a skater and the fact that most athletes don't have that long of a career. If you really have talent, and want this life style, then you have to work hard for it. The movie didn't gloss over how hard a lifestyle skating is. In fact, I was rather surprised by how much Gen'smom was into skating....Tina, the mom,really pushed her daughter into skating. I likedhow Tina wastrying to live vicariously through her daughter's life untill Gen said enough.I thought that the actors did a good job, workingwith each other.

To be eligible for this scholarship, Casey must come up with a `personal' science project. After watching the 1996 Olympics, Casey decides to do her project on the aerodynamic formula of figure skaters, specifically three junior level champions, Gen Hardwood, one of the more popular girls in her school, Nikki Fletcher, and Tiffany Mason.After deciding that her project still lacked that `personal touch', Casey enrolls in a `Summer Sand plow' ice skating class, made up of mostly six-year-olds and coached by Gen's mom, Tina Hardwood. After displaying impressive raw talent, she decides to perform in the recital, where the judges give her a Junior Level pass, meaning that she could be on the same level as Nikki, Tiff, and Gen.Even though Tina told her she would never be able to compete, Casey has her heart set on going to regionals. After dozens of practices, fights with her mom, and her after school job, Casey finally gets the chance to prove she can excel somewhere else, besides a lecture hall.Ice Princess was not as bad as I expected.

906558,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0009JE57G,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 5]","It is interesting that Michelle Trachtenberg's name is third and last before the title of ""Ice Princess"" given that she is the title character.  Joan Cusak and Kim Cattrall get to go before her.  But then it took three ""Superman"" movies for Christopher Reeves to get top billing as the title character, so the young actress can just show patience and hopefully will build on what she has done on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and this 2005 Disney family comedy and move up the cinematic food chain without becoming a tabloid target like Lindsey Lohan or Hillary Duff.Casey Carlyle (Trachetenberg) is a math whiz who likes to skate on the pond outside her house to help clear her mind.  So when she has an opportunity to get a Physics scholarship it makes sense that she would come up with a project to work out the physics of figure skating.  Casey gets Tina Harwood (Cattrall) to let her videotape the practice session of three aspiring junior figure skaters: Tina's daughter Gen (Hayden Panettiere), Tiffany (Jocelyn Lai), and the Jumping Shrimp, Nikki (Kirsten Olson).  But Casey wants to get into not just the theory but the practice, and ends up taking skating lessons from Tina with the little kids.  Well, it turns out that her computer program, along with her innate abilities, put Casey in the same class as the big kids.  At that point, Casey decides that she would like to actually compete at one of the most expensive sports for teenage girls in this country.  Meanwhile, Casey's mom, Joan (Cusack), does not know what her daughter is up to, which is just as good because she would not approve.  Then there is Teddy Harwood (Trevor Blumas), who likes to watch Casey skate and would probably like to watch her do her math homework as well.I liked the fact that ""Ice Princess"" makes it clear that, at least with regards to figure skating, you have to be smart as well as skilled, a point that I think can be extraoplated to other sports as well.  The movie also delivers on the skating sequences, which are key to the film.  We know that Trachtenberg is going to be doubled for the hard stuff (i.e., doubles and triples), but director Tim Fywell (""I Captured the Castle"") does a good job of weaving the two together.  Plus, Trachtenberg really brings the delicate look of a ballerina to her skating, so there is a definite sense of combining art and athleticism in Casey's performances on ice.  It was also nice to see that the character of Gen was not the backstabbing teammate that such roles usually become in sports movies like this one.  This ends up being a surprise given Gen's mom, who is willing to do something underhanded for the last qualifying spot at sectionals (as opposed to selling your soul for first place at regionals or nationals).  But this indicates that the triad of conflict here is between Casey and the two key adults in her life, her mom and Tina (which is also familiar ground in sports movies).I just wish they had set up the competitions better.  Certainly after what happened at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City (and I am talking Sarah Hughes winning the gold medal, not the judging scandal in the pairs competition), we all know how dramatic skating competitions can be.  Michelle Kwan and Brian Boitano show up as commentators, so certainly they could have explained what Casey would need to do (or what she has done) and what it would mean for how she finishes in the competition.  There is some notion that Casey is doing things she should not be able to do, but most of this is communicated after the fact as opposed to setting up a level of expectation to help build anticipation.  Casey's goal is more personal than the other skaters in the competition, which explains why they movie forgets about the Zoe versus Nikki subplot during the final act, even though that is a pretty good context (ala Hughes) in which Casey can skate.  But I think you have a stronger movie is Casey puts herself in a position to win and we are told she has to do x, y and z to pull off the upset and then we watched her try to do it.  It works real well in the real world, and it could be equally as effective here.Even though I think it could have been better, ""Ice Princess"" is a solid enough Disney example of family entertainment featuring the sport that always has the highest ratings at the Winter Olympics.  In terms of extras on this DVD there is a commentary track by Trachtenberg, Panettiere, Blumas, and Olson, that consists mostly of memories of making the movies (e.g., Blumas broke the zamboni a couple of times).  Trachtenberg has a few insights into the story being told (e.g., she says she wanted the scene where Casey confronts Tina), and I think she might have offered us more along those same lines if she was sitting around with grownups.  Olson is able to talk about what really happens in junior skating competitions, as opposed to what the script comes up with, which only underscores my argument above that letting us in on how the game is played would have enhanced the movie.  However, this will not really matter to the tween-age audience that is going to be watching this DVD.  There are also music videos for Caleigh Peters's ""Reach"" and Aly & A.J.'s ""No One,"" a few deleted scenes (including an alternative opening), and trailers for movies targeted as the same demographic group such as ""Valiant"" and the first of ""The Chronicles of Narina"" films, ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.""",4,"Michelle Trachtenberg becomes the ""Ice

It is a coming of age story of a teenage girl, who is engaging in some self-discovery that may change her life.Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg) is a somewhat shy, geeky girl, who  lives in a rural area with her mother, Joan Carlyle (Joan Cusack).  Her mother, a professor at a local backwater college,  feeling that she herself did not always make the best choices when she was younger, pushes Casey hard to excel academically, envisioning Harvard on her daughter's college horizon. Casey is an outstanding student, as she is an extremely bright girl, and is, in fact, a physics whiz. She also loves to figure skate on the pond in her back yard, but as her mother stresses academics over athletics, this is just an enjoyable pastime for Casey.Then, her high school science teacher tells her that she stands a good chance to get a scholarship to pursue physics at the college level. The scholarship requires that she develop a physic project, and the teacher counsels Casey to ground the project in something for which she has a passion. Casey decides that she will have her physics project revolve around the dynamics of figure skating. This project, which is actually quite interesting, will consume Casey's senior year in high school.Casey gets herself over to the local skating rink run by figure skating Coach Tina Harwood (Kim Cattrall). There, Coach Harwood rules her skaters, one of whom is her own daughter, Gen (Hayden Panettiere), and a fellow classmate of Casey, with an iron hand. As Casey becomes more involved in the world of figure skating, she decides that  her project would benefit from some first hand experience. So, she, too, sets foot on the ice, not just as an observer but as a participant. What she discovers along the way, about herself, as well as about others, helps her to be true to herself and to make a decision that brings her happiness.This is a well-acted film with excellent production values.  Michelle Trachtenberg is a delight in the main role, infusing her character with intelligence, decency, and a certain innocence that makes the viewer take to her character immediately.  Joan Cusak, looking remarkably aged, is good in the role of Casey's mother, a highly intelligent, articulate woman who seeks to have her daughter experience the academic and economic success that she herself was unable to attain.Kim Cattrall, however, is a standout in the role of the coach whose own dreams of figure skating glory were shattered years earlier, and who now looks to her daughter, Gen, to make those shattered dreams a reality for own self, although Gen may have other ideas. Hayden Panettiere is excellent in the role of Gen, the beautiful girl who just wants to be able to live her life as other teenage girls do, rather than figure skate competitively.Trevor Blumas is well cast in the role of Teddy Harwood, who runs the Zamboni machine at the skating rink and functions as a wholesome love interest for Casey. Kirsten Olsen is quite funny in the role of red-headed Nikki, a petite, very competitive skater known as the ""Flying Shrimp"" for her prowess on the ice. Julianna Cannarozzo is also very funny in the role of  punky looking and cynical  Zoe Bloch, another competetive figure skater. Both Nikki and Zoe are amusing to watch, whenever they are on screen. For some added interest, Michelle Kwan and Brian Boitano make cameo appearances. Those who like figure skating will especially enjoy this film.The film provides a peek at the world of figure skating and the lengths to which some people will go to succeed in that competitive world. While some of the film may not be realistic, one should just chalk it up to artistic license. The film also delivers a message to both children and parents. For the children, the message seems to be that they must discover something in life that they are passionate about and follow their heart. For parents, the message seems to be that children must follow their dreams and not that of the parents. Sounds like good advice to me!The DVD is a high quality production that provides crystal clear audio and visuals. It has a number of bonus features. Among those features is an alternate opening scene that I thought was quite good, as well as a number of deleted scenes. The DVD also contains two  music videos, ""Reach"" by Caleigh Peters and ""No One"" by Aly and A.J., which all viewers should enjoy.  There is also an excellent and lively commentary by its four young actors, Michelle Trachtenberg, Hayden Panettiere, Kirsten Olsen, and Trevor Blumas. Their commentary adds to one's enjoyment of the film the second time around.  It is a commentary that kids can also enjoy.",4,TO THINE OWN SELF BE TRUE...,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,4782,"['delightful', 'wholesome', 'film', 'tailored', 'general', 'audience', 'should', 'provide', 'fun', 'whole', 'family', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'engaging', 'self-discovery', 'may', 'change', 'life.Casey', 'Carlyle', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'somewhat', 'shy', 'geeky', 'girl', 'who', 'rural', 'area', 'mother', 'Joan', 'Carlyle', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'mother', 'professor', 'local', 'backwater', 'college', 'feeling', 'did', 'not', 'always', 'make', 'best', 'choices', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'pushes', 'Casey', 'hard', 'excel', 'academically', 'envisioning', 'Harvard', 'daughter', 'college', 'horizon', 'Casey', 'outstanding', 'student', 'extremely', 'bright', 'girl', 'fact', 'physics', 'whiz', 'also', 'figure', 'skate', 'pond', 'back', 'yard', 'mother', 'academics', 'athletics', 'just', 'enjoyable', 'pastime', 'Casey.Then', 'high', 'school', 'science', 'teacher', 'good', 'chance', 'get', 'scholarship', 'pursue', 'physics', 'college', 'level', 'scholarship', 'develop', 'physic', 'project', 'teacher', 'counsels', 'Casey', 'ground', 'project', 'something', 'passion', 'Casey', 'will', 'have', 'physics', 'project', 'revolve', 'dynamics', 'figure', 'skating', 'project', 'actually', 'quite', 'interesting', 'will', 'consume', 'Casey', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school.Casey', 'local', 'skating', 'rink', 'run', 'figure', 'skating', 'Coach', 'Tina', 'Harwood', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'Coach', 'Harwood', 'rules', 'skaters', 'one', 'whom', 'own', 'daughter', 'Gen', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'fellow', 'classmate', 'Casey', 'iron', 'hand', 'Casey', 'more', 'involved', 'world', 'figure', 'skating', 'project', 'would', 'benefit', 'first', 'hand', 'experience', 'So', 'too', 'sets', 'foot', 'ice', 'not', 'just', 'observer', 'participant', 'What', 'way', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'be', 'true', 'herself', 'make', 'decision', 'happiness.This', 'well-acted', 'film', 'excellent', 'production', 'values', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'delight', 'main', 'role', 'infusing', 'character', 'intelligence', 'decency', 'certain', 'innocence', 'viewer', 'take', 'character', 'immediately', 'Joan', 'Cusak', 'looking', 'remarkably', 'aged', 'good', 'role', 'Casey', 'mother', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'articulate', 'woman', 'who', 'have', 'daughter', 'experience', 'academic', 'economic', 'success', 'was', 'unable', 'attain.Kim', 'Cattrall', 'however', 'standout', 'role', 'coach', 'own', 'dreams', 'figure', 'skating', 'glory', 'were', 'shattered', 'years', 'earlier', 'who', 'now', 'daughter', 'Gen', 'make', 'shattered', 'reality', 'own', 'self', 'Gen', 'may', 'have', 'other', 'ideas', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'excellent', 'role', 'Gen', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'live', 'life', 'other', 'teenage', 'girls', 'do', 'rather', 'figure', 'skate', 'competitively.Trevor', 'Blumas', 'well', 'cast', 'role', 'Teddy', 'Harwood', 'who', 'Zamboni', 'machine', 'skating', 'rink', 'functions', 'wholesome', 'love', 'interest', 'Casey', 'Kirsten', 'Olsen', 'quite', 'funny', 'role', 'red-headed', 'Nikki', 'petite', 'very', 'competitive', 'skater', 'known', 'Flying', 'Shrimp', 'prowess', 'ice', 'Julianna', 'Cannarozzo', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'role', 'punky', 'looking', 'cynical', 'Zoe', 'Bloch', 'competetive', 'figure', 'skater', 'Nikki', 'Zoe', 'are', 'amusing', 'watch', 'whenever', 'are', 'screen', 'added', 'interest', 'Michelle', 'Kwan', 'Brian', 'Boitano', 'make', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'who', 'like', 'figure', 'skating', 'will', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'film.The', 'film', 'peek', 'world', 'figure', 'skating', 'lengths', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'succeed', 'competitive', 'world', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'realistic', 'one', 'should', 'just', 'chalk', 'up', 'artistic', 'license', 'film', 'also', 'message', 'children', 'parents', 'children', 'message', 'be', 'must', 'discover', 'something', 'life', 'are', 'passionate', 'follow', 'heart', 'parents', 'message', 'be', 'children', 'must', 'follow', 'dreams', 'not', 'parents', 'Sounds', 'good', 'advice', 'DVD', 'high', 'quality', 'production', 'crystal', 'clear', 'audio', 'visuals', 'number', 'bonus', 'features', 'features', 'alternate', 'opening', 'scene', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'number', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'also', 'two', 'music', 'videos', 'Reach', 'Caleigh', 'Peters', 'One', 'Aly', 'A.J.', 'viewers', 'should', 'enjoy', 'also', 'excellent', 'lively', 'commentary', 'four', 'young', 'actors', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'Kirsten', 'Olsen', 'Trevor', 'Blumas', 'commentary', 'one', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'commentary', 'kids', 'can', 'also', 'enjoy']",N/A

Making yourself happy with who you are while still striving to make the best of yourself is a great message for coming-of-age and grade-school tweens who will realize that being smart and athletic are not mutually exclusive.

The problem is that to earn the scholarship she wants, Casey will have to find a project in which she can put a little of herself. Even though choosing what to do seems difficult at first, Casey realizes that she can combine her love for ice skating with physics, using physics to improve the skills of talented ice-skaters. In order to work on her project Casey will have to spend some more time on the ice rink, a place where she will discover an incredible talent she didn't know about, friends waiting to be discovered, and maybe even love. However, Casey will also have to make some choices, for example what and who she wants to be.All in all, I can say that I loved ""Ice princess"".

906573,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0009JE57G,Only-A-Child,"[3, 5]","""Ice Princess"" was not a commercial success despite generally favorable reviews and Disney's costly promotional campaign. The promotional poster is great but did not make much of a difference.What went wrong? At its core ""Ice Princess"" is a modern remake of 1949's ""It Happens Every Spring"". In that film Ray Milland plays an underpaid college professor and long-suffering St. Louis Cardinals baseball fan. He is in his college lab one day working on developing a wood preserving chemical when a baseball comes through the window and smashes all the lab equipment. The chemicals get mixed into a new compound that repels wood. When rubbed on a baseball it causes the ball to jump away from wooden bats. He realizes the possibilities and takes a leave of absence to pitch St. Louis to the World Series. Most of the entertainment comes from having someone who has spent his life in the academic world trying to fit in with the much cruder world of professional sports.""Ice Princess"" makes the main character a high school science wizard, changes the gender, and moves the idea to a skating rink. It is here that it hits its first problem. The professor in ""It Happens Every Spring"" is only playing baseball to earn enough money to marry his sweetheart, he doesn't feel comfortable taking on that responsibility on his low teaching salary. One of the themes is the disparity in salary between the two professions. Throughout the film baseball is always just his ""temporary"" occupation until he returns to teaching, the film is appealing because he always retains his identity as a professor.""Ice Princess"" derails because Casey becomes a figure skater in order to change her identity and realize her ""feminine potential"", although this is masked by an unconvincing  claim that she is pursuing her dream. Which is totally bogus, as someone has already commented: ""as you watch you think to yourself, wow she is pretty, smart, and she is not even trying, which in any other situation leads you to believe that she was better than the girls who are popular and stupid"".  Many viewers spend the movie hoping that she will keep her more likable identity as the smart outsider girl.Plus the idea is overused, so much so that ""Not Another Teen Movie"" satirized the metamorphosis of the: ""Ugly Duckling Girl Who's Really a Babe Underneath"". The joke being that both Chyler Leigh's and Michelle Trachtenberg's ugly ducklings look at least as good as the babes they transform into.The basic premise of ""It Happens Every Spring"" was credible and although it raised some ethical issues, it was highly amusing. The ""Ice Princess"" premise is not even remotely credible and the disconnect is compounded because the premise is more central to the story.Finally, unlike ""It Happens Every Spring's"" almost exclusive focus on its main character, ""Ice Princess"" is at least one story too many as you have several mother-daughter subplots which are contrived, stale, and boring.Perhaps most amazing about the low box office for ""Ice Princess"" is that it is significantly padded by Michelle Trachtenberg's huge male fan base. This means that even more of the movie's target audience is staying away than the attendance figures would indicate. Seeing Trachtenberg is almost reason enough to watch the film, she is much better in her physics student identity but her scenes with Hayden Panettiere and Kristen Olson are also good. Although a failure commercially, it was a good career move for Michelle and a great showcase for her beauty and growing acting skills.Then again, what do I know?

Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg) seems to be fighting on all fronts and also must endure a heightened level of teenage angst while competing against her peers. Trapped in the cocoon of expectations, Casey struggles to live her dream and makes life-changing decisions. Should she attend college or reach for her newfound love: Ice Skating.Ever since I watched Michelle Trachtenberg dancing in the Buffy Musical, I have wondered about her dancing talents and how her natural elegance would be portrayed in future movies.When Michelle started this movie, she had no professional experience skating and the most impressive part of this movie is that she spent months and months in intense training sessions, learning to figure skate. She trained for five hours a day, five days a week. Skating doubles performed the more challenging maneuvers, while she was able to do a significant amount of the skating and this is quite impressive.I could relate to people discouraging me from ice skating and one of the last songs I remember being played at my childhood ice rink in Africa was ""Another One Bites The Dust.""

906578,AMZYAGVDQWTS,B0009JE57G,Reviews No More,"[0, 0]","This is a good movie for young people to watch as it teaches them that you can change your mind about the order of your goals' passions, and that you can make dreams come true if you want them badly enough.  Michelle Trachtenberg gives a very good and likable performance as Casey Carlisle, a high school senior who is well on her way to being a physics major when she reaches college.  In order to get a scholarship, she not only devises a project that scientifically nails figure skating moves, but decides to take part in the sport herself to prove her thesis more credibly.  What happens instead is that she discovers she has a real talent for skating and decides to embark in some serious competing.As an adult, it's a nice family movie, but you will recognize that Disney has a knack for putting out cookie cutter teen flicks with different themes.  A young person won't realize this because the skating is quite good, and the storyline is never boring.  Kim Cattral is worthy as the coach who sometimes genuinely deserves to be hated, but respectably knows her stuff, and Joan Cusack is simply wonderful as Casey's protective, pushy, but admirably feisty mother.  Then again, I have never seen a movie where Joan's appearance was ever a bad thing.  The costumes are very pretty, the routines wonderfully choreographed.  The film is a bit unrealistic, but it makes its point quite clear about going for what you want, and that is entertaining enough.  I will give them props for not letting her win a gold medal at the end, yet allowing her to keep competing with silver, so that it tells the viewer that hard work is often a reward in itself.  I didn't LOVE Ice Princess, but I enjoyed it, and it is worth seeing at least a few times.  It's simply good entertainment with a nice storyline and lesson, and there's definitely nothing wrong with that.",4,4 Stars for the Younger Viewers and 3 Stars for the Adults.,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,1855,"['good', 'movie', 'young', 'people', 'watch', 'can', 'change', 'mind', 'order', 'goals', 'passions', 'can', 'make', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'want', 'badly', 'enough', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'very', 'good', 'likable', 'performance', 'Casey', 'Carlisle', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'who', 'well', 'way', 'being', 'physics', 'major', 'when', 'college', 'order', 'get', 'scholarship', 'not', 'only', 'project', 'scientifically', 'figure', 'skating', 'moves', 'take', 'part', 'sport', 'prove', 'thesis', 'more', 'credibly', 'What', 'instead', 'real', 'talent', 'skating', 'decides', 'embark', 'serious', 'competing.As', 'adult', 'nice', 'family', 'movie', 'will', 'recognize', 'Disney', 'knack', 'putting', 'out', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'teen', 'flicks', 'different', 'themes', 'young', 'person', 'wo', ""n't"", 'realize', 'skating', 'quite', 'good', 'storyline', 'never', 'boring', 'Kim', 'Cattral', 'worthy', 'coach', 'who', 'genuinely', 'be', 'hated', 'respectably', 'stuff', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'Casey', 'protective', 'pushy', 'admirably', 'feisty', 'mother', 'Then', 'again', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'where', 'Joan', 'appearance', 'was', 'ever', 'bad', 'thing', 'costumes', 'are', 'very', 'pretty', 'routines', 'wonderfully', 'choreographed', 'film', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'point', 'quite', 'clear', 'going', 'what', 'want', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'will', 'give', 'props', 'not', 'letting', 'win', 'gold', 'medal', 'end', 'yet', 'allowing', 'keep', 'competing', 'silver', 'viewer', 'hard', 'work', 'often', 'reward', 'did', ""n't"", 'LOVE', 'Ice', 'Princess', 'enjoyed', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'few', 'times', 'simply', 'good', 'entertainment', 'nice', 'storyline', 'lesson', 'definitely', 'nothing', 'wrong']",N/A

906580,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0009JE57G,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","This is a surprisingly good film that completely exceeds the normal expectations placed upon the kind of product usually produced for the target audience. It is also quite intelligent and does not pander or insult or exploit the intelligence of young kids (or adults) the way some do, such as THE PRINCESS DIARIES II. The latter is a kind of wish fulfillment fantasy, almost pornography for little girls, while THE ICE PRINCESS would seem to be heading into the same direction, but stops to become something more.Michelle Trachtenberg, who most of us know as Dawn from BUFFY (a controversial character, disliked by many, though I confess that I enjoyed her very much), does a great job in the lead role. In BUFFY she often seemed to be a bit too tightly wound in her role, a bit too intense. She seems more relaxed here, and she seems comfortable taking the central role. She plays Casey Carlyle, a young physics whiz whose feminist (in a good way) mother is pushing her to limits intellectually. When her high school physics teacher urges her to compete for a physics scholarship by taking on an additional project, she decides to study the physics of jumps in ice-skating. She begins studying the skaters at a local competitive ice-skating rink, and the mastery of theory makes her want to put it into practice. Much of what follows is predictable. Casey proves to be a natural at skating, and suddenly her desire grows to make her want to be as good a skater as she can be. Michelle is very convincing in these sequences. Anyone who saw her in BUFFY, especially in the famous musical episode, where she forewent singing to perform a surprising capable dance number, knows that she has a natural dancer's build, with long legs and ever longer arms. She seems incapable of an awkward pose. I know there are all kinds of vagaries attached to billing in Hollywood films, but by any standard it is bizarre that Michelle Trachtenberg was third billed in this film after the far less important Joan Cusack and Kim Cattrall.The competitive skating sections of the film are far more convincing than usual in such films. Partly this is because actual competitive skaters are used in almost all of the skating roles. And while they certainly used a stunt double for Michelle Trachtenberg's more challenging bits, there are enough moments where you can tell she is clearly doing her own skating to do her considerable credit.The movie is not just about ice skating, but about the way that parents often impose their expectations onto their children, and the struggle that takes place before parents allow them to formulate their own dreams. This comes out not just in Casey's feminist and academic mother resisting Casey's wanting to fulfill her potential as a skater instead of a physicist, but in Kim Cattrall's character forcing her daughter into becoming a skater just as she was. Ironically, by the end of the film both mothers reluctantly allow their daughters to follow their own paths.A pet peeve: academic inaccuracy. You don't ""blow off Harvard"" in the interview process. In fact, interviews with colleges play a minimal role in the acceptance process. In fact, being a competitive skater with good grades would dramatically increase your chances of getting into any good school. The best schools do not want one-dimensional academic grinds, but almost insist on well-rounded students with wide-ranging interests. OK, off my soapbox.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good movie, but I especially encourage parents to gently encourage their kids to see this exceptional movie in lieu of awful pieces of materialistic wish fulfillment pornography like THE PRINCESS DIARIES II.",5,A way above average film teen genre film,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,3686,"['surprisingly', 'good', 'film', 'completely', 'normal', 'expectations', 'placed', 'kind', 'product', 'usually', 'produced', 'target', 'audience', 'also', 'quite', 'intelligent', 'not', 'pander', 'insult', 'exploit', 'intelligence', 'young', 'kids', 'adults', 'way', 'do', 'such', 'THE', 'PRINCESS', 'DIARIES', 'II', 'latter', 'kind', 'wish', 'fulfillment', 'fantasy', 'almost', 'pornography', 'little', 'girls', 'THE', 'ICE', 'PRINCESS', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'heading', 'same', 'direction', 'become', 'something', 'more.Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'who', 'most', 'know', 'Dawn', 'BUFFY', 'controversial', 'character', 'disliked', 'many', 'confess', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'great', 'job', 'lead', 'role', 'BUFFY', 'often', 'seemed', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'tightly', 'role', 'bit', 'too', 'intense', 'more', 'relaxed', 'here', 'comfortable', 'taking', 'central', 'role', 'Casey', 'Carlyle', 'young', 'physics', 'whiz', 'feminist', 'good', 'way', 'mother', 'pushing', 'limits', 'intellectually', 'When', 'high', 'school', 'physics', 'compete', 'physics', 'scholarship', 'taking', 'additional', 'project', 'study', 'physics', 'jumps', 'ice-skating', 'studying', 'skaters', 'local', 'competitive', 'ice-skating', 'rink', 'mastery', 'theory', 'want', 'put', 'practice', 'Much', 'what', 'predictable', 'Casey', 'be', 'natural', 'skating', 'suddenly', 'desire', 'make', 'want', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'skater', 'can', 'be', 'Michelle', 'very', 'convincing', 'sequences', 'Anyone', 'who', 'saw', 'BUFFY', 'especially', 'famous', 'musical', 'episode', 'where', 'forewent', 'singing', 'perform', 'surprising', 'capable', 'dance', 'number', 'natural', 'dancer', 'build', 'long', 'legs', 'ever', 'longer', 'arms', 'incapable', 'awkward', 'pose', 'know', 'are', 'kinds', 'vagaries', 'attached', 'billing', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'standard', 'bizarre', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'was', 'third', 'billed', 'film', 'far', 'less', 'important', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Kim', 'Cattrall.The', 'competitive', 'skating', 'sections', 'film', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'convincing', 'usual', 'such', 'films', 'Partly', 'actual', 'competitive', 'skaters', 'are', 'used', 'almost', 'skating', 'roles', 'certainly', 'used', 'stunt', 'double', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'more', 'challenging', 'bits', 'are', 'enough', 'moments', 'where', 'can', 'tell', 'clearly', 'doing', 'own', 'skating', 'do', 'considerable', 'credit.The', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'ice', 'skating', 'way', 'parents', 'often', 'impose', 'expectations', 'children', 'struggle', 'place', 'parents', 'allow', 'formulate', 'own', 'dreams', 'out', 'not', 'just', 'Casey', 'feminist', 'academic', 'mother', 'resisting', 'Casey', 'wanting', 'fulfill', 'potential', 'skater', 'instead', 'physicist', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'character', 'forcing', 'daughter', 'becoming', 'skater', 'just', 'was', 'Ironically', 'end', 'film', 'mothers', 'reluctantly', 'allow', 'daughters', 'follow', 'own', 'paths.A', 'pet', 'peeve', 'academic', 'inaccuracy', 'do', ""n't"", 'blow', 'off', 'Harvard', 'interview', 'process', 'fact', 'interviews', 'colleges', 'play', 'minimal', 'role', 'acceptance', 'process', 'fact', 'being', 'competitive', 'skater', 'good', 'grades', 'would', 'dramatically', 'increase', 'chances', 'getting', 'good', 'school', 'best', 'schools', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'one-dimensional', 'academic', 'grinds', 'almost', 'insist', 'well-rounded', 'students', 'wide-ranging', 'interests', 'OK', 'soapbox.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'movie', 'especially', 'encourage', 'parents', 'gently', 'encourage', 'kids', 'see', 'exceptional', 'movie', 'lieu', 'awful', 'pieces', 'materialistic', 'wish', 'fulfillment', 'pornography', 'THE', 'PRINCESS', 'DIARIES', 'II']",N/A

But this film definitely stands out strong than any Lohan film ever has. This film actually has a great storyline with some talented actors. I watched it late one night when nothing else was on and found myself drawn into the story almost immediately.One reason why is because I do really enjoy ice skating, I find it a very artistic and beautiful sport and this movie did a good job of highlighting this sport. I know some people assume ice skating is nothing amazing, nothing you have to work too hard for and the young actresses in this film show well how hard you truly have to work and how much stress it is altogether, just like any other sport. So I really appreciated this movie for showing that for I do indeed have great respect for ice skaters and admire their talent.The storyline from the beginning is interesting and is pretty rock- solid- a brainy girl all set for college but has a natural talent for ice skating and through possibly Fate she starts realizing how good she really is, and how happy she is when she skates. So she trains hard for ice skating, fleshing out her already natural talent, but unfortunately starting to ruin her chances for getting into the college of her choice because of all the time she puts into skating. Her mother is against skating, not having much respect for it because she feels skaters don't have much of a future and not very admirable.

But there are, and they're all nice ones.First is the characters, who rise above the level of the usual bland interchangeable stick figures for movies of this kind. Michelle Trachtenberg brings a nice shy spirit to Casey, the aspiring scientist/skater, and she has able support from the always-engaging Joan Cusack as her mother and the nicely flinty Kim Cattrall as the coach. But the nicest surprise is that after a spate of ""mean girl"" movies, this one gives us a character who competes with Casey but is honest, loyal, and supportive.This is a story of a girl with a dream, but it is also the story of two mothers with dreams for their daughters, both based on dreams of their own that did not come true.Casey's mother wants her daughter to become a brilliant scholar. She also wants Casey to dress in sensible (dowdy and middle-aged) clothes. She does not like the ""twinkie little outfits"" that figure skaters wear and admits that ""no matter how old the rest of us get, we will still always hate the prom queen.""Tina (Cattrall) was once a figure skating champion who made a mistake that cost her a chance at an Olympic gold medal. She wants her daughter Gen (Hayden Panettiere) to get the gold medal she could not have. And when Gen tells her that she wants more than skating in her life, she does not listen. Both mothers have to learn that their daughters are entitled to their own dreams. The daughters have to learn that, too.The story had an assist from The Princess Diaries author Meg Cabot, which may be why it feels like it should be called ""Ice Princess Diaries."" But the formula is nicely played out, with sincerity and sweetness enough to inspire the young viewers to come up with some dreams of their own.Families who enjoy this movie may also enjoy The Princess Diaries, like this film, based on a book by Meg Cabot. Older viewers will enjoy some other ice skating movies like The Cutting Edge, Ice Castles and the movies starring real-life Olympic gold medalist Sonja Henie. This story has a lot in common with the classic children's book, ""Skating Shoes,"" part of the ""Shoes"" series by Noel Streatfeild, well worth reading aloud at bedtime. Families may also enjoy seeing Trachtenberg in Harriet the Spy, Cusack in School of Rock, and Panettiere in Remember the Titans and A Bug's Life, as the voice of an ant princess named Dot.",4,Girls will love this sweet and inspiring story about following your dreams.,1129852800,"10 21, 2005",2005,2615,"['When', 'tell', 'story', 'brainy', 'shy', 'girl', 'who', 'being', 'champion', 'figure', 'skater', 'up', 'demanding', 'anything-to-win', 'coach', 'cute', 'guy', 'who', 'Zamboni', 'machine', 'may', 'think', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprises', 'are', ""'re"", 'nice', 'ones.First', 'characters', 'who', 'rise', 'level', 'usual', 'bland', 'interchangeable', 'stick', 'figures', 'movies', 'kind', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'nice', 'shy', 'spirit', 'Casey', 'aspiring', 'scientist/skater', 'able', 'support', 'always-engaging', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'mother', 'nicely', 'flinty', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'coach', 'nicest', 'surprise', 'spate', 'mean', 'girl', 'movies', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'Casey', 'honest', 'loyal', 'supportive.This', 'story', 'girl', 'dream', 'also', 'story', 'two', 'mothers', 'dreams', 'daughters', 'based', 'dreams', 'own', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'true.Casey', 'mother', 'daughter', 'become', 'brilliant', 'scholar', 'also', 'Casey', 'dress', 'sensible', 'dowdy', 'middle-aged', 'clothes', 'not', 'like', 'twinkie', 'little', 'outfits', 'figure', 'skaters', 'wear', 'matter', 'how', 'old', 'rest', 'get', 'will', 'still', 'always', 'hate', 'prom', 'queen', 'Tina', 'Cattrall', 'was', 'once', 'figure', 'skating', 'champion', 'who', 'made', 'mistake', 'cost', 'chance', 'Olympic', 'gold', 'medal', 'daughter', 'Gen', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'get', 'gold', 'medal', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'when', 'Gen', 'more', 'skating', 'life', 'not', 'listen', 'mothers', 'have', 'learn', 'daughters', 'are', 'entitled', 'own', 'dreams', 'daughters', 'have', 'learn', 'too.The', 'story', 'had', 'assist', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'author', 'Meg', 'Cabot', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'Ice', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'formula', 'nicely', 'played', 'out', 'sincerity', 'sweetness', 'enough', 'inspire', 'young', 'viewers', 'come', 'up', 'dreams', 'own.Families', 'who', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'may', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'Meg', 'Cabot', 'Older', 'viewers', 'will', 'enjoy', 'other', 'ice', 'skating', 'movies', 'Cutting', 'Edge', 'Ice', 'Castles', 'movies', 'starring', 'real-life', 'Olympic', 'gold', 'medalist', 'Sonja', 'Henie', 'story', 'lot', 'common', 'classic', 'children', 'book', 'Skating', 'Shoes', 'part', 'Shoes', 'series', 'Noel', 'Streatfeild', 'well', 'reading', 'aloud', 'bedtime', 'Families', 'may', 'also', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'Trachtenberg', 'Harriet', 'Spy', 'Cusack', 'School', 'Rock', 'Panettiere', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'A', 'Bug', 'Life', 'voice', 'ant', 'princess', 'named', 'Dot']",N/A

In this case, the princess part is because she is a wonderkind on the ice.Add to this mix a healthy dose of the popular blonde girl who eventually comes to recognize that Math is important, too and the witchy trainer and the mother who wants her daughter to follow in her own footsteps instead of going in her own and you have another Disney live action hit.  I went to see this with a friend who loves math and the movie made her happy because it starred a girl who loved math as the hero.  This is true, but by the end we also have a girl who gives up her gift in math to pursue ice skating.I think what annoys me about this film, though, is that it reduces the art, the skill and the years upon years of practice something like ice skating takes into a math formula.  The movie tries to rectify this by saying ""an equation can't make you pull it off flawlessly"" but then we have a girl who hasn't been practicing too much and by the end of the film she's going to start preparing for the Olympics?  That kind of cheapens men and women who have been practicing since they were two to get ready for the Olympics.Anyway, I miss the old Disney movies that had imagination and creativity.

906595,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0009JE57G,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","Michelle Trachtenberg is so irresistibly charming in `Ice Princess,' Disney's fairy tale that you might forget the incredible plot and a few cliches of the film. The film's main story, as some critics say rightly (and harshly), lacks originality, but the characters, especially the supporting ones, have surprisingly complex personalities.The film begins unpromisingly with shaky and unsure direction. Brainy high-school girl Casey wants to win a scholarship, so she makes scientific researches on the physics of the skaters. For Casey is no stranger to the skills of skating (as we are shown in the opening), living in a small town of Connecticut. But Casey, as it turns out, has talent as figure skater. And by now, you already know Casey's real dream is not going to Harvard.The film gets better as it goes on, introducing Casey's competitors including Gen (Hayden Panettiere), and Gen's manipulative mother (Kim Cattrall). Though Joan Cusack playing Casey's nervous mother gets top-billed in the credit, it is Michelle Trachtenberg and her charming heroine who grabs the interest of the viewers from the beginning to the end, whether you are a teenager or a thirty-something adult like me.You might remember a similar romance `The Cutting Edge' (1992) in which figure skating plays a significant role in the film, and the actors have to be convincing as skaters. In 'Ice Princess' there is a love interest, handsome Zamboni driving Trevor Blumas, but his role is not very effective, looking as if an obligatory one. Still the crisp figure skating scenes of `Ice Princess' are entertaining, and the skaters look authentic enough to me, figure skating being one of the merits of `Ice Princess,' but some say (perhaps unnecessarily) that in the real world of sports the competitors cannot (or are not allowed to) do such programs. Is it so? I don't know, but I enjoyed watching them and that's what matter most, isn't that?Like the same Disney's `Princess Diaries,' it is a modern fairy tale on screen, which fares unexpectedly better thanks to the leading lady's charms that come so naturally from lively Michelle Trachtenberg.

In preparation of this possibility studio heads started greenlighting every project that they could so that they would have plenty of episodes and projects under wrap if they needed them. As things turned out, the strikes never happened. However, other than a brief slowdown for a couple months following September 11, 2001, the industry doesn't seem to have let up on the amount of garbage that is still being churned out. Before the strike-churning began, only about 1/3rd of the movies a person watched were worthwhile. Nowadays, a person is lucky if 1/5th of the movies they see are worth mentioning again to other people. As a result, whole new sub-genres of movies have developed over the past four years. Instead of just romantic comedies, there are teen romantic comedies, romantic comedies for adults, romantic comedies starring animals, etc. Another such sub-genre that has developed over the past few years is teen chick flicks.Teen chick flicks are basically chick flicks that star teenage girls (or actors pretending to be teenage girls) and only appeal to a pre-teen age/early teen age female audience. The majority of teen chick flicks aren't worth the film used to make the movie, not to mention all the hidden messages these movies contain that have a negative impact upon a young lady's self image, e.g. ""Only if you dress like a Hollywood starlet will you then be able to attract a boyfriend worthy of your beauty.""When I first heard about ICE PRINCESS, I thought to myself, ""Oh great, another terrible teen chick flick."" When I saw that it was from Disney, it made it that much worse. However, after having been presuaded to watch the film, I can say that ICE PRINCESS is not the typical teen chick flick and is much better than I ever expected it to be.The movie weaves a tale around the fictional character of Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg), a female high school science whiz from the northeastern U.S. who likes to figure skate in her spare time. Casey has the opportunity to win a full ride physics scholarship to the college of her dreams: Harvard. However, as part of the application procedure, Casey has to create a physics project that both demonstrates scientific principles and applies them to a real life situation. It takes Casey awhile to figure out what she is going to do, but after watching some classmates practice in a local rink, she gets a brilliant idea and begins working on a computer program that can help figure skaters become better skaters. Of course, (just like all those crazy mad scientists in old sci-fi movies) in order to make sure the program truly works, she has to test it out on herself. In doing so, Casey unleashes a long heart-felt desire to skate within herself and soon finds herself questioning everything she thought she has always knew.ICE PRINCESS is a Disney movie and it is mostly a teen chick flick, so the plot is kind of predictable. At the same time, the movie doesn't take the usual twists. That is probably what I found most unusual about the film. Though it is full of hope and promise, the movie makes it a point to illustrate that life isn't always fair and that we can't always have everything we want (or think we want). It also points out some of the nasty things about starting out in professional sports (e.g. the expense, the time committment, etc.) that many sports movies never even infer, let alone mention.Though the movie will probably be most enjoyed by young girls, the film does have some appeal to adults. The movie has some really fine acting, especially considering the type of film it is. Kim Cattrall plays Tina Hardwood (you've got to love those puns) the very demanding, yet very talented skating coach who becomes a mentor to Casey. Trachtenberg does a great job in her first motion picture starring role. The actors in other secondary roles do a nice job, too. However, the person really to watch in this movie is Joan Cusack (the Cusack siblings are quite talented, but in my opinion Joan is a better actor than brother John). Cusack plays Casey's hard-working, feminist single mom. In the hands of a less talented performer, Casey's mom would have seemed bitter and envious, but with Cusack in the part, the audience feels sympathetic for her, even when she is being most smothering.ICE PRINCESS is rated G. Therefore, there is no foul language, sexual references, or violence. It's a movie that young girls will surely enjoy. However, adults might enjoy the movie, too, if they give it a chance.The DVD version of the film includes a couple of music videos, a commentary, deleted scenes, and an alternate opening scene. The music videos aren't too bad too watch a feature some possible future teeny-bopper stars. Most of the deleted scenes don't add much to the plot, but the alternative opening provides the audience with a deeper understanding into Casey's life.",4,Better Than Expected,1125014400,"08 26,
