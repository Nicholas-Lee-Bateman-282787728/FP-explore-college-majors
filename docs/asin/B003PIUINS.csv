Whoever put this out just copied the same crap that was already out there, and compressed the 4 movies to fit on 2 CD's. There was also some pixelating as well. I own a plethera of movies and this is by far the worst I've ever seen. Don't waste your time buying. If you try to get these movies individually you'll have the same problem with the third movie as in this seires. The others (1,2 and 4-3D will be okay). The problem is with #3.

Its like if you want to go back in time, if you mess with something you make the future different. And in the sense of the movies if you are gonna mess with Death and try to cheat it, its just going to come back in full circle and get you eventually. Don't mess with Karma, Death, Life, Destiny, Faith whatever else goes in that category.Two what i thought of the movies:Final Destination: For sure is my favorite out of the four. I have always been a fan of Devon Sawa. I felt like the effects were done just right. It kept me guessing through the whole movie and the ending was great, made me so excited to see the next one.Final Destination 2: I was having trouble playing this one in my DVD. It wouldn't bring me to the menu to play the movie. It would just get stuck after the animation of the logo. I tried it on my laptop and it went past the animation and to the previews to the main menu. So put it back in my DVD player and just somehow got it to go to the end where its the extra features are and than just went to the menu and playing it from there...it annoyed me so much. But the movie itself wasn't a bad add on to the first movie I thought it went well just going on with the story from where it left off. effects were good as well.Final Destination 3: This is where I don't know if they should have stopped these after this one or before. I'm already not a fan of roller coasters or tanning beds and this one really makes me want to stay away from those two things for sure! The story was pretty good but at this point I was thinking this is stupid...not the story. By itself it handled its own but for as the whole package, you tend to know whats coming or think yea i seen this before, you people are funny thinking you could stop this. I liked how they used the pictures as on who's next on the list..that was pretty cool. I think they could have stopped after the second one and have this one as a totally different movie and named it something else actually.The Final Destination aka (4): UGH this is the one i enjoyed the least. I liked the things he saw and how they did that but the effects at the beginning with the race and them getting crashed by the ceiling it was like yea that was definitely made by a computer. The part I dug was the mechanic getting slammed against the fence so hard that it cut him all the way through and the diamond shaped chunk of body falls off! I felt like the acting was definitely worse of the four, i wanted to smack every one of them for their ""stupidity"" thats how their acting felt like they had no talent and didn't convince me of anything.Three im annoyed that there is a fifth one. You say final but yet you change your darn mind and make another (GRR!) Not going to lie I will probably watch it, but I'm pretty sure everyone already knows what's going to happen and just like all other sagas it just keeps getting worse and worse as the number of movie gets higher. Only movies that I havent felt a saga sucking after the first two isSAW Complete Horror Collection DVD BOX 1.2.3.4.5 Unrated, Uncut I-VSaw VI (Rated Full Screen Edition)Saw: The Final Chapter...I love Saw &lt;3! But anyway as a whole of the final destinations...Im in the middle..I like them but I do want them to end. why? Like I said at the beginning: to mess with stuff like that, if its supposed to happen, it will.",3,Final Destination 1-4 Pack,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,3456,"['First', 'just', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'time', 'leave', 'Earth', 'maybe', 'just', 'time', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'mess', 'something', 'make', 'future', 'different', 'sense', 'movies', 'are', 'gon', 'mess', 'Death', 'try', 'cheat', 'just', 'going', 'come', 'back', 'full', 'circle', 'get', 'eventually', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'Karma', 'Death', 'Life', 'Destiny', 'Faith', 'else', 'category.Two', 'what', 'i', 'thought', 'movies', 'Final', 'Destination', 'sure', 'favorite', 'four', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Devon', 'Sawa', 'felt', 'effects', 'were', 'done', 'just', 'right', 'kept', 'guessing', 'whole', 'movie', 'ending', 'was', 'great', 'made', 'so', 'excited', 'see', 'next', 'one.Final', 'Destination', '2', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'playing', 'one', 'DVD', 'would', ""n't"", 'bring', 'menu', 'play', 'movie', 'would', 'just', 'get', 'stuck', 'animation', 'logo', 'tried', 'laptop', 'went', 'animation', 'previews', 'main', 'menu', 'So', 'put', 'back', 'DVD', 'player', 'just', 'somehow', 'got', 'go', 'end', 'where', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'just', 'went', 'menu', 'playing', 'annoyed', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'add', 'first', 'movie', 'thought', 'went', 'well', 'just', 'going', 'story', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'well.Final', 'Destination', '3', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'should', 'have', 'stopped', 'one', ""'m"", 'already', 'not', 'fan', 'roller', 'coasters', 'tanning', 'beds', 'one', 'really', 'want', 'stay', 'away', 'two', 'things', 'sure', 'story', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'point', 'was', 'thinking', 'stupid', 'not', 'story', 'handled', 'own', 'whole', 'package', 'tend', 'know', 'whats', 'coming', 'think', 'yea', 'i', 'seen', 'people', 'are', 'funny', 'thinking', 'could', 'stop', 'liked', 'how', 'used', 'pictures', 'who', 'next', 'list..that', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'stopped', 'second', 'one', 'have', 'one', 'totally', 'different', 'movie', 'named', 'something', 'else', 'actually.The', 'Final', 'Destination', 'aka', '4', 'UGH', 'one', 'i', 'enjoyed', 'least', 'liked', 'things', 'saw', 'how', 'did', 'effects', 'beginning', 'race', 'getting', 'crashed', 'ceiling', 'was', 'yea', 'was', 'definitely', 'made', 'computer', 'part', 'dug', 'was', 'mechanic', 'getting', 'slammed', 'fence', 'so', 'hard', 'cut', 'way', 'diamond', 'shaped', 'chunk', 'body', 'felt', 'acting', 'was', 'definitely', 'worse', 'four', 'i', 'wanted', 'smack', 'one', 'stupidity', 'thats', 'how', 'acting', 'felt', 'had', 'talent', 'did', ""n't"", 'convince', 'anything.Three', 'im', 'annoyed', 'fifth', 'one', 'say', 'final', 'yet', 'change', 'darn', 'mind', 'make', 'GRR', 'Not', 'going', 'lie', 'will', 'probably', 'watch', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'everyone', 'already', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'just', 'other', 'sagas', 'just', 'getting', 'worse', 'worse', 'number', 'movie', 'higher', 'Only', 'movies', 'havent', 'felt', 'saga', 'sucking', 'first', 'two', 'isSAW', 'Complete', 'Horror', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'BOX', '1.2.3.4.5', 'Unrated', 'Uncut', 'I-VSaw', 'VI', 'Rated', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'Saw', 'Final', 'Chapter', 'love', 'Saw', 'lt', '3', 'anyway', 'whole', 'final', 'destinations', 'Im', 'middle..I', 'do', 'want', 'end', 'why', 'said', 'beginning', 'mess', 'stuff', 'supposed', 'happen', 'will']",N/A
