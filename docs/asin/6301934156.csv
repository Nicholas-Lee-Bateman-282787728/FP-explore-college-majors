Originally shown on the BBC in 1983, I was first introduced to the series in the late `80s on PBS. I was probably about four at the time and I was unfamiliar with the story upon which it's based. But I was immediately taken by the subtle sophistication of the film. The animation was unlike anything I'd ever seen and to this day it holds a great fascination to me. The first film in this set is a marvelous adaptation of the book, which is remarkable considering the length of the book and the film is just under an hour and a half long. The second film, from 1989, is a silly sequel that retains the charm of the original even though it's not based upon Grahame's tale. Both films are worthy of a spot on your family's DVD shelf.The Wind in the Willows - 1983The story concerns a group of animal characters that live in the English countryside. There Mole, sick of spring cleaning, has decided to go out into the sun and visit his friend Ratty. They enjoy a good day of ""messing about in boats"" and having a picnic (where we are first introduced to the nefarious weasels). Finally Mole and Ratty pay a visit to the wealthy and eccentric Mr. Toad who shifts from one neurotic obsession to another. Soon he becomes entranced by motorcars and is revealed to be a danger to himself as well as the other animals. With that in mind Mole and Ratty seek out the reclusive Badger, whose great wisdom might be an asset in reeling Toad in and exorcising him of his ""motorcar mania"". But it's too late for Toad has stolen a car and been involved in yet another accident. Toad is sent to prison and the weasels move into his home, making it their headquarters for delinquency. But Toad manages to escape with the help of a washerwoman and enlists the aid of Ratty, Mole and Badger in an attempt to recapture Toad Hall.The Wind in the Willows: A Tale of Two Toads - 1989In this sequel, the weasels seek revenge on Mr. Toad and once again take over Toad Hall. This time they utilize another Toad, this one an actor, and succeed in temporarily dividing the animals and turning them against each other. It's not long before their treachery is revealed and the two Toads must confront one another to decide who will possess Toad Hall.The DVDs are produced by A&E;, to whom I am grateful for this release, but unfortunately neither of the films have been remastered or given a proper restoration. This causes the film to look faded and there are numerous times where artifacts (spots of dirt, dust and debris) can be seen. Although this can be rather annoying, it never depreciates the enjoyment of the viewing. This series is highly recommended not only for its nostalgic value but also for its superlative storytelling. Truly a family classic!Also recommended:The Wind in the Willowsby Kenneth GrahameWind in the Willows: The Complete First SeriesThe Wind in the Willows: The Complete Second Series",4,The Wind in the Willows,1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,3006,"['Cosgrove', 'Hall', 'charming', 'stop-motion', 'animated', 'adaptation', 'Kenneth', 'Grahame', 'story', 'spectacular', 'family', 'entertainment', 'Originally', 'shown', 'BBC', '1983', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', 'series', 'late', '80s', 'PBS', 'was', 'probably', 'four', 'time', 'was', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'based', 'was', 'immediately', 'taken', 'subtle', 'sophistication', 'film', 'animation', 'was', 'anything', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'day', 'great', 'fascination', 'first', 'film', 'set', 'marvelous', 'adaptation', 'book', 'remarkable', 'considering', 'length', 'book', 'film', 'just', 'hour', 'half', 'long', 'second', 'film', '1989', 'silly', 'sequel', 'charm', 'original', 'even', 'not', 'based', 'Grahame', 'tale', 'films', 'are', 'worthy', 'spot', 'family', 'DVD', 'shelf.The', 'Wind', 'Willows', '1983The', 'story', 'concerns', 'group', 'animal', 'characters', 'live', 'English', 'countryside', 'Mole', 'sick', 'spring', 'cleaning', 'decided', 'go', 'out', 'sun', 'visit', 'friend', 'Ratty', 'enjoy', 'good', 'day', 'messing', 'about', 'boats', 'having', 'picnic', 'where', 'are', 'first', 'introduced', 'nefarious', 'weasels', 'Finally', 'Mole', 'Ratty', 'pay', 'visit', 'wealthy', 'eccentric', 'Mr.', 'Toad', 'who', 'shifts', 'one', 'neurotic', 'obsession', 'Soon', 'entranced', 'motorcars', 'revealed', 'be', 'danger', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'animals', 'mind', 'Mole', 'Ratty', 'seek', 'out', 'reclusive', 'Badger', 'great', 'wisdom', 'might', 'be', 'asset', 'reeling', 'Toad', 'exorcising', 'motorcar', 'mania', 'too', 'late', 'Toad', 'stolen', 'car', 'been', 'involved', 'yet', 'accident', 'Toad', 'sent', 'prison', 'weasels', 'move', 'home', 'making', 'headquarters', 'delinquency', 'Toad', 'escape', 'help', 'washerwoman', 'aid', 'Ratty', 'Mole', 'Badger', 'attempt', 'recapture', 'Toad', 'Hall.The', 'Wind', 'Willows', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Toads', '1989In', 'sequel', 'weasels', 'seek', 'revenge', 'Mr.', 'Toad', 'once', 'again', 'take', 'over', 'Toad', 'Hall', 'time', 'utilize', 'Toad', 'one', 'actor', 'succeed', 'temporarily', 'dividing', 'animals', 'turning', 'other', 'not', 'long', 'treachery', 'revealed', 'two', 'Toads', 'must', 'confront', 'one', 'decide', 'who', 'will', 'possess', 'Toad', 'Hall.The', 'DVDs', 'are', 'produced', 'A', 'E', 'whom', 'am', 'grateful', 'release', 'unfortunately', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'remastered', 'given', 'proper', 'restoration', 'film', 'look', 'faded', 'are', 'numerous', 'times', 'where', 'artifacts', 'spots', 'dirt', 'dust', 'debris', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'annoying', 'never', 'enjoyment', 'viewing', 'series', 'highly', 'recommended', 'not', 'only', 'nostalgic', 'value', 'also', 'superlative', 'storytelling', 'Truly', 'family', 'classic', 'Also', 'recommended', 'Wind', 'Willowsby', 'Kenneth', 'GrahameWind', 'Willows', 'Complete', 'First', 'SeriesThe', 'Wind', 'Willows', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Series']",The Wind in the Willows: The Ghost At Mole End and other stories VHS
273495,A2J1H1FQTA0PM3,6301934156,C. Schrawder,"[44, 45]","When I first learned of this show I instantly fell in love with it.  When I learned they did many episodes I enjoyed even that much more.  Many years later I finally learned just how many episodes they did, and realized I must have missed out on many of them, and was in utter shock and awe at all the wonderful work that Cosgrove and Hall did.  This first single disc DVD is on the feature length episode that Cosgrove and Hall produced.  Take one of my favorite styles of animation, add some talented (and a few favorite) British voice actors, and add the creative talent of Cosgrove and Hall, and give them an inspiring loveable book, and you get an immense amount of Family Fun Time.  After you view this one feature length episode hold on to your hats.  To be released around March of 2005 is the first of about 5 volumes A&E; plans to produce, so that they may be the very first in the market to completely release to the public every single one of the 65 (YES, you heard that right ""65!"") 20 minute episodes that the talented Cosgrove and Hall company produced.  Never before has the public been allowed to purchase and view in their homes every single episode of this fantastic series.  The only things in the past that were release on tape were the feature length episode, and about 3 or 4 tapes with 3 episodes each (with 1 or 2 episodes changed out when they were reproduced a couple of times).  It's shocking that it took this long to let the public in all this fun (Who's been hoarding and hiding all these recordings anyway?).  Thanks finally to A&E; for being the first company to get the rights (after several others had the rights over the years) to devote all the time and effort they are going to do to get all the episodes out to the public.  YEAH for A&E;!  So many of us have been longing for such a lengthy amount of time to finally own every episode.  I especially enjoy this show just tad bit more than others, as this show helped bring me out of a dark depressing time I went through early one year, when I happened to stumble upon this show again on a PBS channel, and low and behold by some freak of nature they were airing some of the episodes in the early to mid 90's.On to a side comment, I don't know how someone can give this show a bad rating, and then also go on a rant about it having bad language.  What show were you watching anyway?  Unless you're a super uptight paranoid parent who gets offended by everyone else in world, this show is certainly for everyone.  So don't let any kind of review like that deter you from having any kind of fun.  RUN, don't walk, and get your copies of every single one of these episodes, and start having a great fun time.",5,Hurry in to the Wonderful World of Cosgrove & Hall,1108080000,"02 11, 2005",2005,2694,"['When', 'first', 'learned', 'show', 'instantly', 'fell', 'love', 'When', 'learned', 'did', 'many', 'episodes', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'Many', 'years', 'later', 'finally', 'learned', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'episodes', 'did', 'realized', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'out', 'many', 'was', 'utter', 'shock', 'awe', 'wonderful', 'work', 'Cosgrove', 'Hall', 'did', 'first', 'single', 'disc', 'DVD', 'feature', 'length', 'episode', 'Cosgrove', 'Hall', 'produced', 'Take', 'one', 'favorite', 'styles', 'animation', 'add', 'talented', 'few', 'favorite', 'British', 'voice', 'actors', 'add', 'creative', 'talent', 'Cosgrove', 'Hall', 'give', 'inspiring', 'loveable', 'book', 'get', 'immense', 'amount', 'Family', 'Fun', 'Time', 'view', 'one', 'feature', 'length', 'episode', 'hold', 'hats', 'be', 'released', 'March', '2005', 'first', 'about', '5', 'volumes', 'A', 'E', 'plans', 'produce', 'may', 'be', 'very', 'first', 'market', 'completely', 'release', 'public', 'single', 'one', '65', 'YES', 'heard', 'right', '65', '20', 'minute', 'episodes', 'talented', 'Cosgrove', 'Hall', 'company', 'produced', 'Never', 'public', 'been', 'allowed', 'purchase', 'view', 'homes', 'single', 'episode', 'fantastic', 'series', 'only', 'things', 'past', 'were', 'release', 'tape', 'were', 'feature', 'length', 'episode', '3', '4', 'tapes', '3', 'episodes', '1', '2', 'episodes', 'changed', 'out', 'when', 'were', 'reproduced', 'couple', 'times', 'shocking', 'took', 'long', 'let', 'public', 'fun', 'Who', 'been', 'hoarding', 'hiding', 'recordings', 'anyway', 'Thanks', 'finally', 'A', 'E', 'being', 'first', 'company', 'get', 'rights', 'several', 'others', 'had', 'rights', 'years', 'devote', 'time', 'effort', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'get', 'episodes', 'public', 'YEAH', 'A', 'E', 'So', 'many', 'have', 'been', 'longing', 'lengthy', 'amount', 'time', 'finally', 'own', 'episode', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'show', 'just', 'tad', 'bit', 'more', 'others', 'show', 'helped', 'bring', 'dark', 'depressing', 'time', 'went', 'early', 'one', 'year', 'when', 'happened', 'stumble', 'show', 'again', 'PBS', 'channel', 'low', 'behold', 'freak', 'nature', 'were', 'airing', 'episodes', 'early', 'mid', ""90's.On"", 'side', 'comment', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'someone', 'can', 'give', 'show', 'bad', 'rating', 'then', 'also', 'go', 'rant', 'having', 'bad', 'language', 'What', 'show', 'were', 'watching', 'anyway', ""'re"", 'super', 'uptight', 'paranoid', 'parent', 'who', 'offended', 'everyone', 'else', 'world', 'show', 'certainly', 'everyone', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'kind', 'review', 'deter', 'having', 'kind', 'fun', 'RUN', 'do', ""n't"", 'walk', 'get', 'copies', 'single', 'one', 'episodes', 'start', 'having', 'great', 'fun', 'time']",The Wind in the Willows: The Ghost At Mole End and other stories VHS

273504,A1LTJCQGRPTOTD,6301934156,STEPHEN T. McCARTHY,"[4, 9]","It was my dear departed Ma who introduced me to the magical children's book, THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS by Kenneth Grahame.  This was shortly after I graduated from high school, when I would periodically read chapters from the Winnie-The-Pooh series to her.  Well, I fell in love with Grahame's book (Mr. Toad is one of the greatest characters in English literature!), and about 1983 or '84, I upgraded my little paperback copy to a really beautiful hardcover copy published by Grosset & Dunlap, which includes wonderful colorful illustrations.  (That copy still sits proudly in a bookcase right next to THE WORLD OF POOH by A. A. Milne.)In 1989, my Ma purchased a VHS copy of this Mark Hall and Brian Cosgrove ""stop-motion"" animated production of THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS for my niece and nephew.  Weeeeell... When I saw it, I instantly fell in love with it and obtained my own copy.  (I would have stolen the copy from my Ma's grandchildren, but that sort of thing usually earns one some nasty karma, and I seem to have all I can stand as it is, thank you very much!)  This movie is probably even better than the book, and I've already told you how the book is esteemed by me.  From the first viewing, this became my all-time favorite stop-motion movie, and that has never changed.  Oh sure, I love Nick Park's Wallace & Gromit - particularly THE WRONG TROUSERS, with its punky penguin, Feathers McGraw.  (I seriously considered using Feathers McGraw as my Ammyland pen name when I wrote my first review for this website.)  But you know, nothing's ever gonna catch MR. TOAD in my book ... I mean, he drives awfully fast in that little motorcar!In 1990, I took my tape over to my then-girlfriend's apartment, thinking that she might like to see it.  (""The Countess"" was a good ol' gal, with an appreciation for the finer things in life, like the classic Tex Avery and Tom n Jerry cartoons.)  Well, I played it for her once and unwittingly created a monster.  She asked me to bring it a second time, which I did.  And thereafter, every time I showed up at her apartment, the first words out of her mouth were, ""Did you bring Mr. Toad?""  And when I answered, ""No"", she'd immediately begin to pout.  It was as if she wasn't happy to see me unless I was accompanied by that impertinent, little green amphibian.  The first forty times, I thought she was just joking (I'm a bit dense), but after that it finally occurred to me that she had given her heart to Toad, and I truly was in the doghouse without him.  So, I finally wised up and bought The Countess her own copy of THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS, so she could watch it anytime she desired, and I thereby erased her perpetual pout.  But I'll tell ya the truth... that d*mned frog, I love the bloke, even if he did steal my gal.This 78 minute stop-motion movie is filled with marvelous characters and memorable lines:  Of course, there's first and foremost ""the famous Mr. Toad"" (don't think he's famous?  Just ask him!) with his beloved horse-drawn caravan, which he disdains as a ""common canary-colored cart"" when he encounters his first motorcar.  And then his motorcar mania which ultimately wreaks so much havoc, causing him to lose the family's venerable Toad Hall.  There's sensible Ratty, Sensitive Mole, the wascally Weasels, and old, stoic n stout Mr. Badger.  (Man! You just don't mess with Badger!  The Weasels found that out the HARD way.  He was ""Thumpin' an' thumpin' an' thumpin'"" `em!)And are there ever some funny lines that The Countess and I used for many years afterwards!  (""Out of my way!""; ""Chap's a d*mn frog!"") I love the scene where the young field mouse is trying to inform Mole about something and Mole admonishes him about his pronunciation, telling him not to drop his ""H""s.  And the little mouse obeys in saying, ""It's Toad, sir - he's got hisself harrested!""  And there's that moment when Ratty and Mole wander nearby Mole's long-forgotten hole in the ground (Mole End) and he becomes unexpectedly homesick.  Sniffling, he says in a low voice, ""I smelt it and I wanted it.""  The Countess and I got lots and lots of mileage out of that line.  We used it for Italian restaurants, saloons, compact discs, movies, trips to Disneyland, and on and on.  But the day she pointed to an engagement ring and said, ""I smelt it and I wanted it"", I was forced to break her smeller.But seriously, while there is lots of action in THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS, portions of it are a tad slow for the movie's intended target age.  There are a number of idyllic scenes (e.g., the ""Up Tails All"" duck sequence) that are likely to lose the interest of your youngsters (you know how they're captivated only by the ""Whizbang-Clangdang"" stuff), and the thick English accents (that delight us) are sometimes going to be a bit tough for the kiddies to follow.  But you know, to heck with them, get this children's movie for yourself and wait for your kids to ""grow up"" enough to fully appreciate it.  But men, don't let your wives see it or yer gonna lose `em to that suave ladies' ... uhm ... Toad.  Well, unless that's your intention.Listen, I gotta run now.  I just got a phone call from the police department and I gotta go bail out my Brother, Napoleon.
