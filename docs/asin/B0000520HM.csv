563891,A37RIRXE3WECZ,B0000520HM,April Blake,"[20, 20]","I like working out with my shaper ball because it makes exercise seem more like fun and less like punishment.  But because I needed more guidance on this new piece of equipment than was provided on the chart that came with it, I turned to Kathy Smith, my fitness guru for guidance.  I thought, Kathy has not yet led me astray, and I bought this video without question.Granted, the living room backdrop isn't too inspiring, but that would be easy to overlook, if only...The atmosphere on this tape is very odd, from the moment Kathy introduces her friend, a muscular man in bike shorts, to the end of the cooldown stretches.  More than is necessary, Kathy puts in infomercial-like plugs for the shaper ball, which, presumably, if someone bought this tape, wouldn't they already own and love their shaperball?  Another thing that adds an element of &quot;weird&quot; to this tape is that Kathy's friend talks too much for an exercise video.  There seems to be this weird flirtation between the two of them.  Imagine if you will, the ninth grade JV basketball player who has a crush on the senior girl who's captain of the cheerleading squad.  That's what you have here on this tape.But the exercises!  Once you get past the flirtation and the infomercial, the exercises would be pretty good for a beginner or someone who wants to have a less-intense exercise day, but still put their body in motion.  Maybe the thing to do would be to go through the tape twice, and then you'd get a rigorous workout.  It certainly isn't up to the standards of the other Kathy Smith videos I know and love.",3,Strange,1015977600,"03 13, 2002",2002,1587,"['like', 'working', 'out', 'shaper', 'ball', 'exercise', 'seem', 'more', 'fun', 'less', 'like', 'punishment', 'needed', 'more', 'guidance', 'new', 'piece', 'equipment', 'was', 'provided', 'chart', 'came', 'turned', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'fitness', 'guru', 'guidance', 'thought', 'Kathy', 'not', 'yet', 'led', 'astray', 'bought', 'video', 'question.Granted', 'living', 'room', 'backdrop', ""n't"", 'too', 'inspiring', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'overlook', 'only', 'atmosphere', 'tape', 'very', 'odd', 'moment', 'Kathy', 'friend', 'muscular', 'man', 'bike', 'shorts', 'end', 'cooldown', 'stretches', 'More', 'necessary', 'Kathy', 'infomercial-like', 'plugs', 'shaper', 'ball', 'presumably', 'someone', 'bought', 'tape', 'would', ""n't"", 'already', 'own', 'love', 'shaperball', 'thing', 'element', 'quot', 'quot', 'tape', 'Kathy', 'friend', 'talks', 'too', 'much', 'exercise', 'video', 'be', 'weird', 'flirtation', 'two', 'Imagine', 'will', 'ninth', 'grade', 'JV', 'basketball', 'player', 'who', 'crush', 'senior', 'girl', 'who', 'captain', 'cheerleading', 'squad', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'tape.But', 'exercises', 'Once', 'get', 'flirtation', 'infomercial', 'exercises', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'beginner', 'someone', 'who', 'have', 'less-intense', 'exercise', 'day', 'still', 'put', 'body', 'motion', 'Maybe', 'thing', 'do', 'would', 'be', 'go', 'tape', 'twice', 'then', ""'d"", 'get', 'rigorous', 'workout', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'up', 'standards', 'other', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'videos', 'know', 'love']",Kathy Smith Timesaver Shaper Ball Workout VHS

Kathy and her assistant, Michael, begin with a 6 1/2 minute warm-up:  moving with the ball held in your hands, stretching using the ball, and sitting on the ball both to open your hips and to get used to balancing.  Next comes a 7-minute abs segment which includes a total of 4 exercises:  the first three work your upper abs, lower abs, and obliques respectively while seated on the ball, and the final works the side muscles.  The following segment consists of a series of back extensions, the first performed face up on the ball and the last last two performed face down; this section is 6 minutes long.  The final section, which I clocked at 9 1/2 minutes, focuses on the lower body.  I found the hamstring work to be particularly tough as well as the three sets of wall squats (the last two are performed on one leg).  The workout ends with a single stretch, no cool-down, for a total of 29 minutes.There are two things that I really liked about this video:  1) Kathy shows three different levels of modifications for every exercise, so you can make each exercise easier or more challenging, and 2) brief stretches are included between many of the exercises, and these feel so good on the ball.  On the negative side, I did not feel that this workout was very intense, as I would have preferred if Kathy had spent less time instructing and more time actually performing the movements.  Furthermore, I would have liked to have seen some upper body work included in the routine.  Overall, however, this was a decent introduction to ball work and would be good for those who want to build back and lower body strength.",4,A decent ball workout focused mainly on the lower body,1105747200,"01 15, 2005",2005,1698,"['just', 'got', 'stability', 'ball', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'tried', 'Kathy', 'assistant', 'Michael', 'begin', '6', '1/2', 'minute', 'warm-up', 'moving', 'ball', 'held', 'hands', 'stretching', 'using', 'ball', 'sitting', 'ball', 'open', 'hips', 'get', 'used', 'balancing', 'Next', '7-minute', 'abs', 'segment', 'total', '4', 'exercises', 'first', 'three', 'work', 'upper', 'abs', 'lower', 'abs', 'obliques', 'respectively', 'seated', 'ball', 'final', 'side', 'muscles', 'following', 'segment', 'series', 'back', 'extensions', 'first', 'performed', 'face', 'up', 'ball', 'last', 'last', 'two', 'performed', 'face', 'down', 'section', '6', 'minutes', 'long', 'final', 'section', 'clocked', '9', '1/2', 'minutes', 'focuses', 'lower', 'body', 'found', 'hamstring', 'work', 'be', 'particularly', 'tough', 'as', 'well', 'three', 'sets', 'wall', 'squats', 'last', 'two', 'are', 'performed', 'one', 'leg', 'workout', 'single', 'stretch', 'cool-down', 'total', '29', 'minutes.There', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'really', 'liked', 'video', '1', 'Kathy', 'three', 'different', 'levels', 'modifications', 'exercise', 'can', 'make', 'exercise', 'easier', 'more', 'challenging', '2', 'brief', 'stretches', 'are', 'included', 'many', 'exercises', 'feel', 'so', 'good', 'ball', 'negative', 'side', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'workout', 'was', 'very', 'intense', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'Kathy', 'had', 'spent', 'less', 'time', 'instructing', 'more', 'time', 'actually', 'performing', 'movements', 'Furthermore', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'upper', 'body', 'work', 'included', 'routine', 'Overall', 'however', 'was', 'decent', 'introduction', 'ball', 'work', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'who', 'want', 'build', 'back', 'lower', 'body', 'strength']",Kathy Smith Timesaver Shaper Ball Workout VHS

In fact, for learning the correct form for stability ball workouts, it is hard to beat.However, it is a training session, not a workout. Unless you are very new to this form of workout, you will not feel that you have done much work. Your heartrate will not rise. You will not look forward to those slightly sore muscles the next day. And there is a great deal of talking and no music, so you certainly will not experience that ""flow"" enjoyment of the workout.There are lots of good moves, though, for abs and back in particular. There are some nice stretches,and several exercises I hadn't encountered in classes or other workout DVDs.I would say this is ideal for getting to know the stability ball and learning how to adapt moves for different levels of difficulty.Once you've gone through it, though, go to a class or try Lizbeth Garcia's On the Ball Pilates workout instead.",3,Rent this one,1173139200,"03 6, 2007",2007,967,"['Kathy', 'Smith', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'well-researched', 'safe', 'clear', 'fact', 'learning', 'correct', 'form', 'stability', 'ball', 'workouts', 'hard', 'beat.However', 'training', 'session', 'not', 'workout', 'are', 'very', 'new', 'form', 'workout', 'will', 'not', 'feel', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'work', 'heartrate', 'will', 'not', 'rise', 'will', 'not', 'look', 'forward', 'slightly', 'sore', 'muscles', 'next', 'day', 'great', 'deal', 'talking', 'music', 'certainly', 'will', 'not', 'experience', 'flow', 'enjoyment', 'are', 'lots', 'good', 'moves', 'though', 'abs', 'back', 'particular', 'are', 'nice', 'stretches', 'several', 'exercises', 'had', ""n't"", 'encountered', 'classes', 'other', 'workout', 'DVDs.I', 'would', 'say', 'ideal', 'getting', 'know', 'stability', 'ball', 'learning', 'how', 'adapt', 'moves', 'different', 'levels', 'difficulty.Once', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'though', 'go', 'class', 'try', 'Lizbeth', 'Garcia', 'Ball', 'instead']",Kathy Smith Timesaver Shaper Ball Workout VHS
