While this one isn't a ""classic"" bad movie, it has some borderline moments.The plot revolves around a family that needs a guard dog, a former police dog that needs a second chance, and some inept home robbers. Those elements should have been enough to make a very good film.Unfortunately, there are a lot of problems with the movie.- The acting (by humans) is absolutely atrocious. It was 1/3 of the way through the film before I realized that it was supposed to be a comedy. The comic timing was off, the actor's delivery was off, and the film plot didn't make it clear that you were supposed to be laughing at what was happening on screen. Because it wasn't designed as a drama, it ended up not working as drama or comedy. What that makes it, I have no idea, except perhaps ""a mess"".- All the scenes with Grandma were just annoying.- I'm not sure what happened to Ms. Donovan's face, but it looked like some bad plastic surgery. I don't know if it was the lips or what, but everyone watching the move agreed that the effect was almost scary. I hate to mention such a thing, but it really hit the viewer, so it needs to be mentioned.- The plot was merely adequate. On a project like this the viewer pretty much knows what is going to happen, but a few plot twists would have been nice to mix things up. As it was, the acting did not cover up the plainness of the plot.One the good side:- The dog was cute (except that the dog actor was a female, and the camera angles made this apparent, even though the plot called for a male dog). The other dogs were also nice.- The film was fairly well paced.- Some of the comic moments were OK, especially when the crooks were in the house.- This would not bother some people, but the movie was shot in our locale of Los Angeles, specifically the San Fernando / Santa Clarita valley, and it was really interesting to see how they drove to Grandma's house via what appeared to be the Angeles Crest highway. In real life they would have gone many, many miles. I suppose it was actually humerous.- This was obviously a low budget film. Be sure and watch the credits; we had a blast reading all those names. It appears that all the extras were from the families of the film crew. This may account for some of the acting problems.In summary, it isn't charming or cute, it has some good moments, and it is on the borderline of being so bad that it is good.

1282710,A3GKMK6KQH3Y1H,B002PB4I3W,B. Niedt,"[1, 2]","This ABC Family TV movie is a cross between ""Home Alone"", ""Marley and Me"" and ""Look Who's Talking"" - with all the worst elements of each. Zeus is a former K-9 police dog who's rescued from a shelter by a family looking for a good watchdog.  After falling short of expectations, and threatened with returning to the pound, he redeems himself by thwarting two bumbling burglars (Dean Cain and Joey Diaz).  Speaking of falling short of expectations, this predictable and painfully unfunny film does just that, even for the standards of an ABC Family movie. The acting and direction are generally bad - Gary Valentine, who plays the dad, is a poor man's Kevin James (and is in fact James' brother).  Elisa Donovan resembles a younger, less funny Catherine O'Hara; and the actors playing the kids seem too old for their roles.  Even the dog's voice (Mario Lopez) is annoying, though Zeus is somewhat charming in a mature-Lab kind of way.  The ""Cat Lady"" (Adrienne Barbeau), a misunderstood neighbor who helps Zeus face his fears, and the grandma who sings karaoke (Mindy Sterling), are perhaps the two most interesting characters and give the film at least a few non-cliched moments.  And the pet mice have a couple of good lines. Will your kids like it?

1282716,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B002PB4I3W,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","The Dog Who Saved Christmas is not sooooo bad that it's funny; it's just bad enough that it is not funny. C actors agreed to do this film; they exited on the D list.Zeus is a sad dog that turns himself into the dog pound, at least he'll get three meals a day. He meets a group of talking dogs and we learn that Zeus used to be a rescue dog. We then meet the Bannister family at Christmas time. They need a guard dog, but Mom Bannister doesn't want a dog. Dad Bannister decides to get a dog from the pound. Zeus is the lucky dog. All the fun starts there!!!The movie had some potential, Zeus the dog is a cute Labrador retriever. Talking dogs!! Air Bud, cute dog series? The idea is cute, adopt a dog from the pound and the family will just love it to pieces and have a happy Christmas. The execution is something altogether different.At one point my wife summed up the film perfectly, this is a documentary on how not to make a movie.We've gotten used to special effects. Not in this film, there is exactly one special effect, the moon setting over the house. The dogs talk in our imagination, or without moving their mouths. So there are these awful jiggly, out of focus, shots of dogs standing around with voice over narration. Oh, even white mice and cats get in the act. Occasionally the camera is turned around and gives us the dog point of view of people talking to them.An indication that this is a bad movie, I noticed that the prop person, hired to wash the car windows, never washed the car windows in the first car scene. I noticed dirty windows. It's not clear what Mr. Bannister does for a living, but it's pretty clear he's not a surgeon. In the background of their upstairs library is a copy of ""Thoracic Surgery"" and the ""PC Bible"". Clearly, the house was rented from a surgeon.The worst continuity problem was in the last scene. The family walks outside in broad dailight. They meet the ""Cat Lady"" next door just outside their fence. The Cat Lady is in progressively darker light. They cut back and forth between early dusk and bright sunlight of the family. Finally, Cat Lady asks the family a question, and the family is now in the dark with Christmas lights all lit up. This conversation was about 6 lines, maybe 30 seconds in real time.The acting is pitiful. The camera work is even worse, with many out of focus shots, and horrible handheld camera wiggling all over. Editing was bad. And the story line was just full of so many holes, it was laughable.Let me assemble the cast. The director, Michael Feifer, specializes in gruesome murderer movies, BTK, Bundy and American Icon, Chicago Massacre: Richard Speck; horror movies, Grim Reaper, The Butcher, and The Graveyard. Gary Valentine (Kevin James real life brother, plays Doug's brother on the King of Queens) plays Dad Bannister. Charlie Stewart, A Suite Life, Disney star plays the oldest son that is supposed to be about 13, but looks 19 (and is 16 in real life). Elisa Donovan, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, plays Mrs. Bannister looking about 15 years younger than her husband. Mario Lopez, Saved by the Bell, is Zeus' voice. There is exactly one person that can act in this mess, and she has a small part; Adrienne Barbeau (a fairly large sex symbol in the 70's and 80's) plays the Cat Lady.The film was shot in California and Christmas is very green. But the Police car and the thieves' van have Connecticut license plates.This is an hour and a half movie that is just way too long. It is rated PG. Watch out for the little kids, the dogs in the pound are held in what looks like a real prison, huge bars and all. Otherwise, this film is family friendly.

Zeus tries hard to prove he deserves a place in the Bannister household. Trouble is, Zeus can't bark due to a traumatic incident while he was working as a police dog. Dad (Gary Valentine from ""The King Of Queens"") and the kids love Zeus instantly, but the wife/mom thinks he is less than ideal as a guard dog and should be taken back to the pound (after Christmas is over, of course). While the family is away visting Grandma, two bumbling burglers, straight out of ""The World's Dumbest Criminals,"" break in and Zeus, finally, finds his ""voice.""If nothing else, ""Dog"" proves that Dean Cain's star has sadly slipped since his high-flying debut as Superman on ""Lois And Clark"", and his impressive turn as a gay player in ""The Broken Hearts Club.""

1282730,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B002PB4I3W,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 1]","""The Dog Who Saved Christmas"" is the story of Zeus, a former police dog who is adopted by the Bannisters, a family concerned about being robbed over the holidays. We soon discover that Zeus has a psychological problem though, and it's one that prevents him from being any good as a guard dog. Due to an on the job trauma, Zeus is afraid to bark. Being useless as a guard dog makes him unwanted by the family's matriarch, Belinda, and she is determined to return him to the pound after Christmas, despite the rest of the family's love for the dog. It's up to Zeus to prove himself during a Christmas robbery that two bungling burglars have been planning for a while.""The Dog Who Saved Christmas"" is an adequate television Christmas movie fit for the family audience. It has some cute ideas and some genuinely funny moments, often due to what seems to be a lot of improv by the actors and a lot of awkwardness that may or may not have been intentional. There are some annoying factors too. Sometimes the jabbering of the dumber burglar can be tiring, and there's something about the voice over of Mario Lopez as Zeus (yes, we hear his thoughts, or dog talk, here much like in Disney's Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey) that seems more obviously done after the fact than on big screen releases. I'm not sure why this problem exists, but I think it's a direct to video or made for TV thing, as it reminds me of the trailers for the Buddies films. Anyway, if you can get past this, the performances are mostly pretty good. Gary Valentine and Elisa Donovan are great as the parents. Though, you will find yourself double-taking a lot, as Gary seems a bit like a clone of Kevin James. Elisa, on the other hand, I never have been too into her before, but she is super gorgeous here. Dean Cain is great as the smarter of the two dumb crooks, and Mario Lopez does a sincere and decent job as Zeus, whom you do feel for in the film, even though some of the writing for him could have been better and there's that problem I mentioned before of it sounding too much like something recorded in a sound booth later. Also worth noting are Adrienne Barbeau and Mindy Sterling, who were very good in their respective roles. One area I really want to give the film extra credit for is that it was better than I originally expected. Yeah, I'm only giving it three stars, but I didn't expect to give it that many, and I almost feel like giving it 3 and a half (but not quite like rounding up). The reason I thought it was better than expected is that it didn't end up just a whole film of 2 burglars falling into booby traps a la Home Alone. That happens, but it is not much of the film at all. There is more attention paid to the theme of getting over past traumas and not letting them define your life and cause you to miss out on other things. So, nice job on that. This may not be on par with Christmas TV movies from my childhood, but it's certainly got its pluses.The DVD of ""The Dog Who Saved Christmas"" is presented in widescreen and includes a commentary with some of the filmmakers and stars, a behind the scenes look at Mario Lopez recording his dialogue, and the film's trailer.

The Bannister family is worried about frequent robberies in their neighborhood, so they adopt Zeus.  Only problem is, Zeus doesn't bark.  And, predictably, he runs into the family while they are carrying a huge gingerbread house, and drinks out of the toilet, etc.So even though the dad and two odd-looking children really love the dog, they plan on taking him back to the pound because of the doggity things he does.  Meanwhile, they leave him alone in their house while they go to visit grandmother on Christmas Eve.  I mean, who leaves an unruly dog alone in their home?  Nobody does.So these bumbling robbers, who have been breaking in and robbing houses in the nearby vicinity of the Bannister house, decide to rob them.  During the day.  Sure they would.  I mean, the cops are looking for robbers and these guys just drive right up to the house, park on the street and go inside the home, where they spend hours inside - eating food and playing pool, etc.  How likely is that?  Not very.They muzzle Zeus, and detain him for seemingly hours, while they stumble around the house, bumping into each other and commenting on family photos, playing pool, etc.  Zeus decides to get rid of his fear of barking, described more in detail during the movie, but I had already lost interest at that point.  Blah Blah Blah, yadda yadda yadda, and Zues saves the day.And then the Bannister family decide to keep him, because he's a hero who caught robbers, and he won't have to go to the pound and be put down for not barking, and drinking out of the toilet, etc.This movie is seriously ridiculous and I hate the way they nonchalantly adopt a pet and then decide, after a few minor incidents, to take the dog back to the pound, where in real life, he'd face certain death.

The mother (played by Emily Donovan whom you may remember as Amber in the '90's hit Clueless) only wants the dog as a gaurd dog but since the pooch can't/won't bark she sees no value in him (even though her two kids adore him) and wants the dog to go back to the pound. The family leaves for an overnight trip to the gramdmother's house and leaves the dog at home. From this point on, the dog attempts to run off a pair of burglars 'Home Alone' style...only really lame. He drops some ornaments and flour on their head and then gets muzzled and tied up. Obviously, he prevails in the end and the family decides to keep him.The plot is weak, the dialouge is really cheesy and a lot of what they say doesn't even make sense. Not to mention the burglars - they are really obnoxioius. The voice over for the dog is badly done in my opinion. There is a lot of dialouge for the dog that does not match the dogs actions at all. For example, the dog will be ""saying"" something in a really exciting voice but the dog in the movie looks like he's about to fall asleep. To me, that is just sloppy film making. I mean, atleast get a shot of him while he's wagging his tail or something!I had to force myself to sit through it and my kids lost interest pretty quickly.

1282740,A2068BC3ZXAVJQ,B002PB4I3W,"scesq ""scesq""","[0, 0]","The Dog Who Saved Christmas is a family friendly movie with a great message that suffers from okay acting from the humans and poor acting (or training) when it comes to the dog. It's a fine movie to watch with children and kept my attention as well. I wish I could give this three and a half stars but I gave it four because it is above average when it comes to the plot.The plot is simple,A dog that can't bark because of a past traumatic event foils some robbers only after overcoming this event. There is also a subplot regarding a neighbor who is not really what she seems to be.My big problem with the movie is the way the dog was trained.  The key to this movie is having a lovable dog interacting with everyone around him whether it be his owners or the robbers as well as performing human like actions. While the dog is cute I often felt he was looking at his trainer offstage rather than the people in the movie. There were a number of times when he seemed to be staring out into space when people were around him.People like it when animals become like humans and teach us about ourselves. Part of the premise of the movie is that the dog protects his home from robbers by moving things. For instance the dog drops Christmas ornaments and flour on the robbers.  Yet I did not see the dog grabbing the bag of flour and getting it on the robbers or taking the ornaments and dropping them on the robbers. You saw the dog and then the picture cut away and things happened.I really wonder if the producers did not have time to train the dog very well or if it was just too expensive to do so. I don't know how movies are made so maybe his scenes could have been edited better to make him seem more interested and make it seem like he was performing human-like actions.I want to make it clear that I like dogs and I liked the dog in the movie, but since the dog is the star of this picture I wish he had been trained better. It takes a special dog to interact with actors when there is a set full of people.While I am not an expert on dog training, there is a long history in the movies going back to Rin Tin Tin and Lassie and Benji where dogs were trained very well to perform on camera and interact with people. For me the dog was a disappointment.The human cast is fine.  The husband, wife and children seem like they are part of a family.  The crazy grandmother is believable as is the neighbor. The two robbers were okay as well.The acting was something you would see on a television show.  It was nothing special but it was okay.The plot and story was actually good. It is good for children and even adults to be reminded that any living thing can overcome past traumatic events and be a hero.

The family leaves the house on Christmas eve to visit Grandma and Zeus now alone.

This is the first sign of many that the film is simply middle-of-road.The story is typical -- think ""Home Alone"", but with a dog, and you'll pretty much sum-up the plot. This is a story about good vs. bad, with very few side plots, and very little depth. As a result, however, it should be easy for young viewers to keep up with the story.Unfortunately, there are quite a few problems. For one, there's a pretty violent part where one of the evil characters wants to beat the dog with a golf club. The language during this scene is much harsher than it really needs to be, and even with the PG-rating, it's a deal-breaker for me.More than half-way through the film, my daughter asked ""When will the dog save Christmas?"" Although the plot is apparent, it really doesn't get started until the last third of the film. So it's a long journey.The editing is really weak. At times, I thought there were many scenes that should have just been cut. It seemed like there were scenes that were added because perhaps the film was too short. Even the plot sometimes seems constructed ""on-the-fly"". There are several scenes that will leave you thinking ""why didn't the dog just..."" because there are things so obvious, you don't understand how the director/writers missed it.Mario Lopez, as the voice of Zeus, is entertaining. The cast is OK, but at times, due to the way the script is written, the family seems entirely ""too perfect"".
