1502278,AN7ENTRR9UKYE,B005SH63VA,"Michael E. Pajak ""monarchmike""","[2, 3]","First off, Young Justice is a great animated show airing on Cartoon Network. It is a worthy successor to all the DC animated series that have come before it.Volume 3 has four episodes (#9-12) from the first season, and features the kids facing Psimon (of the Fearsome Five), Lex Luthor, Ra's al Ghul, Sportsmaster, Cheshire, the villains at Belle Reve Penitentiary, and Red Tornado's ""siblings"" Red Torpedo and Red Inferno (yes, really!). The kids are also seen in their high school environments with cameo appearances from other DC teens like Mal Duncan and Karen Beecher (from the original Teen Titans), Wendy and Marvin, (yes, THAT Wendy and Marvin, but NO Wonderdog), and Bette Kane and Barbara Gordon. The only Special Feature is a Digital Comic Book reprint of a few pages and panels from Young Justice #0 that you can page through screen by screen. For those of you who don't collect comics, this particular issue takes place just before the end of Episode #2, so it's almost like watching storyboards of deleted scenes. Cool!And for you folks who support this show and ALREADY have Volumes 1 and 2 on DVD, and only want Volume 3, then purchase this set, instead ofYoung Justice: Season One - Volumes 1, 2 & 3. That ""package"" combo set has the EXACT same 3 discs as the individual 3 volumes, with NO additional features. However, If you HAVEN'T bought any individual volumes yet, then by all means, the ""package"" set is the way to go.Now for all those newbie collectors of the WB animated series who are all whining and complaining over and over again about Warner's marketing strategy of only releasing a few episodes at a time for a new series, well, this is nothing new! They have been doing it this way for years. This is how they determine how popular a series is, and whether or not to release full season sets. You folks are doing a DISSERVICE to the show by telling folks not to buy them, and you JEOPARDIZE the chance for full season sets.Would I like to see them start off with just full season sets, or half season sets? Absolutely, who wouldn't? Uh well, the average consumer, that's who. These initial releases are geared toward the general public, and NOT the ""I-want-it-all-now-and-I'm-entitled-to-it"" fanboy collectors. The casual buyer just wants to sample a show to see if they like it. Not everybody reads comic books and knows these characters, not everyone has Cartoon Network or religiously watches it to find new episodes, and believe it or not, not everyone has TIVO or DVR's.Just about every WB animated series has been initially released this way in individual volumes. If they sell well, then they will switch to full season sets. This is what happened with Super Friends, Batman: The Animated Series, Superman: The Animated Series, Batman Beyond, Justice League, Teen Titans, The Batman, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, even A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, and What's New, Scooby-Doo?But, and here's the risk, if they DON'T sell well, they won't even continue the individual volumes OR release a season set. This is what happened to Static Shock, Legion of Super-Heroes, and Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue! I'm a completist. I want it all, no matter how bad the show is to watch (I'm looking at you, Shaggy & Scooby...)So, if you want full season sets of WB animated series, you need to support these individual volume releases, whether you buy them or not. And waiting for a hopeful season set is obviously a great alternative to buying the individual volumes now, and then upgrading later. But, if you continue to whine and complain over and over, and give bottom ratings to great shows, and in turn that influences folks to NOT buy them, which in turn results in low sales, well, then you have no one to blame but yourselves if you are still waiting for your Legion of Super-Heroes season sets.

1502279,AZXFS8GCTSQ5R,B005SH63VA,NF,"[1, 2]","This DVD contains only four 23-minute episodes, which, as far as I'm concerned, means it's not worth the money. If you buy these DVDs individually, rather than wait for the release of the full season, you'll end up paying nearly double the overall cost. What the studio is doing, as they've done with their other animated shows, is unconscionable and unjustifiable, and I strongly recommend that you not give them your money until they release the full season. Rent them from Netflix instead.If I were to rate the content rather than the studio greed, I would give this release 4 stars. The team is starting to gell and the writers are starting to reveal more details about the major villain of the season, ""The Light,"" including one episode in which we learn two of the prominent members of that latter group. Both are familiar to longtime readers of the DC universe.The romance between Superboy and Miss Martian takes another step forward but I agree with some of the other commentators that both are still a little too one-note for my taste. And I will be very happy to never hear ""Hello, Megan!"" again.

1502280,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B005SH63VA,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[43, 50]","*****A (slightly) BETTER RELEASE IS SCHEDULED***** As another reviewer has posted, do not buy this unless you absolutely feel you have to. Even if you don't mind these boneless releases there is a Volume 1-3 bundle being released that will only cost 3 dollars more ($14.99) than this volume does alone ($11.99). So while I still wish a proper release was coming at least they have bundled the boneless releases for a better price, its already listed on amazonYoung Justice: Season 1 Volumes 1-3.This show only gets better as the first season progresses so much layering, so much character development and so much well done action. That said, these releases are still fairly pointless, they could release a Season 1: Part 1 blu by now with special features and then release the second half later with more but instead we just get the episodes and nothing more when mots of us can tivo them.I understand the marketing aspect and trying to rake in as much cash as they can, though I may not agree with it, but WB is just terrible at these volume releases. If they do want to continue these releases, as I've said before and will continue to say, they could really learn a lesson from Nickelodeon. The Last Airbender series is a key example, they broke those seasons up and released them with only 4 (and later 5 episodes per disc), but at least they included some basic extras. Those basic extras, 4-5 minute behind the scenes interviews and such, became much more in depth as the show gained popularity, including complete animatics, full episode commentaries, etc. Then in an effort to force fans to double dip later they would package all those releases together, extras included, and add even more new features (on one occassion four all new commentaries on the finale) while charging a much more reasonable price.WB, with many of its animted series, seems to think this market is purely for children and just tosses out standard definition episodes as if they still cannot be attained any other way. This isn't the nineties or even the early 2000's, there is no justifiable reason to purchase episodes alone in low quality. With todays digital age these episodes can be bought digitally in better definition or even found online for free in the same quality they broadcast.Come on WB get your act together and put in at least a minimal amount of effort. Add some clips of Weisman talking about the show, throw on a rough animatic, even a featurette talking about the creation or the materials the show is based on. This is a great show but these releases are insulting, I can only hope we get a proper release when the season finishes but even then I fear WB may shove out the episodes without any extras and may not even put them in high definition. What happened to the days of releases like Batman: TAS or Justice League? Let's have a welcome return to releases like that or better yet releases like The Last Airbender Complete Collections.For those who haven't seen the show, it is AMAZING! The action is excellently choreographed and maintains a reality that surpasses most current blockbusters, and I'm not just hyping it, the fights are unique and have a weight and reality to them while feeling fresh and like we haven't seen them done this way before. The character's are each well defined and unique and the character development is well balanced, giving us a bit of new insight each episode as well as having some building love interests just to keep things fun. The stories are drawn right from the comics but are given a dimension of reality that finds them feeling adult. The animation is top notch and overall this show breathes new life into the DC Universe, which has been feeling a bit stale for most since Justice League Unlimited ended.Give this show a try but don't bother with these idiotic DVD's, maybe if no one buys them they will finally change their methods.",3,"LOVE the series, NOT these releases",1320537600,"11 6, 2011",2011,3887,"['*****A', 'slightly', 'BETTER', 'RELEASE', 'IS', 'SCHEDULED*****', 'reviewer', 'posted', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'absolutely', 'feel', 'have', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'boneless', 'releases', 'Volume', '1-3', 'bundle', 'being', 'released', 'will', 'only', 'cost', '3', 'dollars', 'more', '14.99', 'volume', 'alone', '11.99', 'still', 'wish', 'proper', 'release', 'was', 'coming', 'least', 'have', 'bundled', 'boneless', 'better', 'price', 'already', 'listed', 'amazonYoung', 'Justice', 'Season', '1', 'Volumes', '1-3.This', 'show', 'only', 'better', 'first', 'season', 'so', 'much', 'layering', 'so', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'so', 'much', 'well', 'done', 'action', 'said', 'releases', 'are', 'still', 'fairly', 'pointless', 'could', 'release', 'Season', '1', 'Part', '1', 'blu', 'now', 'special', 'features', 'then', 'release', 'second', 'half', 'later', 'more', 'instead', 'just', 'get', 'episodes', 'nothing', 'more', 'when', 'mots', 'can', 'tivo', 'them.I', 'understand', 'marketing', 'aspect', 'trying', 'rake', 'as', 'much', 'cash', 'can', 'may', 'not', 'agree', 'WB', 'just', 'terrible', 'volume', 'releases', 'do', 'want', 'continue', 'releases', ""'ve"", 'said', 'will', 'continue', 'say', 'could', 'really', 'learn', 'lesson', 'Nickelodeon', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'series', 'key', 'example', 'broke', 'seasons', 'up', 'released', 'only', '4', 'later', '5', 'episodes', 'disc', 'least', 'included', 'basic', 'extras', 'basic', 'extras', '4-5', 'minute', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'such', 'became', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'show', 'gained', 'popularity', 'including', 'complete', 'animatics', 'full', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'etc', 'Then', 'effort', 'force', 'fans', 'double', 'dip', 'later', 'would', 'package', 'releases', 'together', 'extras', 'included', 'add', 'even', 'more', 'new', 'features', 'one', 'occassion', 'four', 'new', 'commentaries', 'finale', 'charging', 'much', 'more', 'reasonable', 'price.WB', 'many', 'animted', 'series', 'think', 'market', 'purely', 'children', 'just', 'tosses', 'out', 'standard', 'definition', 'episodes', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'attained', 'other', 'way', ""n't"", 'nineties', 'even', 'early', '2000', 'justifiable', 'reason', 'purchase', 'episodes', 'alone', 'low', 'quality', 'todays', 'digital', 'age', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'bought', 'digitally', 'better', 'definition', 'even', 'found', 'online', 'free', 'same', 'quality', 'broadcast.Come', 'WB', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'put', 'least', 'minimal', 'amount', 'effort', 'Add', 'clips', 'Weisman', 'talking', 'show', 'throw', 'rough', 'animatic', 'even', 'featurette', 'talking', 'creation', 'materials', 'show', 'based', 'great', 'show', 'releases', 'are', 'insulting', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'get', 'proper', 'release', 'when', 'season', 'finishes', 'even', 'then', 'fear', 'WB', 'may', 'shove', 'out', 'episodes', 'extras', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'put', 'high', 'definition', 'What', 'happened', 'days', 'releases', 'Batman', 'TAS', 'Justice', 'League', 'Let', 'have', 'welcome', 'return', 'releases', 'better', 'yet', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'Complete', 'Collections.For', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'AMAZING', 'action', 'excellently', 'choreographed', 'reality', 'most', 'current', 'blockbusters', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'hyping', 'fights', 'are', 'unique', 'have', 'weight', 'reality', 'feeling', 'fresh', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'done', 'way', 'character', 'are', 'well', 'defined', 'unique', 'character', 'development', 'well', 'balanced', 'giving', 'bit', 'new', 'insight', 'episode', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'building', 'love', 'interests', 'just', 'keep', 'things', 'fun', 'stories', 'are', 'drawn', 'right', 'comics', 'are', 'given', 'dimension', 'reality', 'feeling', 'adult', 'animation', 'top', 'notch', 'overall', 'show', 'new', 'life', 'DC', 'Universe', 'been', 'feeling', 'bit', 'stale', 'most', 'Justice', 'League', 'Unlimited', 'ended.Give', 'show', 'try', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'idiotic', 'DVD', 'maybe', 'one', 'will', 'finally', 'change', 'methods']","Young Justice: Season 1, Volume Three"

1502282,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B005SH63VA,Zack Davisson,"[1, 2]","I have this theory that people aren't really expected to buy the DVD releases for ""Young Justice.""  They exist mainly for the online rental market.  If you think about it, it makes sense. ""Young Justice"" is still a series in production.  All of the episodes haven't even been made yet, so how are they supposed to release a ""Season One"" box set?  They will eventually, sure.  But in the meantime, people who have heard about ""Young Justice"" but don't have cable TV--like me--can keep up with the series via DVD rental.It's not a bad idea.  As worthless as I think these little 4-episode, 90 minute DVD mini-releases are, if it weren't for them I wouldn't be watching ""Young Justice.""But yes, to engage the broken record and beat the dead horse; this DVD is terrible.  As withVolume OneandVolume Two, you get all of four episode, commercials for bonus features (whatever those are.  They include a digital issue of the comic ""Young Justic,"" but don't even give you the entire issue.), and a total running time of 90 minutes. This means that, with 26 episodes total, collecting Season 1 of ""Young Justice"" will cost around a bunch of cash and clutter your house with six or seven DVD boxes.  That is seriously old school.  Remember when a box set for an anime took up half your bookshelf?  That's what will happen if you pick up all of the individual Young Justice releases.OK, rant over. So how are these four episodes?  Pretty damn cool!  I was getting wary of Young Justice following some ""cry-baby of the week"" -style storytelling, but that has been abandoned in favor of telling compelling stories.On the negative side, I am getting a little sick of Miss Martian.  She was always portrayed as the bubbly airhead of the team, but in this latest DVD she has been reduced to an inane catch-phrase (""Hello, Megan!?!"") and a crush on Superboy, without any other depth of character.  I think they are going for the same cheerful naivet&eacute; of ""new alien arrived on Earth"" that made Starfire so charming in the Teen Titans cartoon.  But they are failing.Bereft - The team finds themselves in Bialya, having lost six months worth of memories and wandering the desert barely remembering each other.  The culprit is the villainous Psimon, the old Teen Titans foe with the visible brain.This was a great episode.  Shows like Young Justice have to walk a fine line between pandering to old school comic guys like me, and keeping the characters fresh and interesting.  Bringing in Psimon was a good call; he has always been an impressive and worthy opponent. I was surprised not to see the rest of his Fearsome Five, but there is always time.My favorite part of this episode: when Kid Flash discovers he can change the color of his uniform by pressing his emblem, so all of the rest of Young Justice start pressing on their chests to see if their costumes change.Targets - A lot of heavy emotional drama in this one.  What do you do if assassins are targeting an ambassador, and that ambassador happens to be Lex Luthor.  Do you save him anyways? And with Ra's al Ghul and the League of Shadows involved, is saving him even an option?This was my favorite episode of the four. I love Red Arrow's internal conflict, how he feels he is too old to be a junior sidekick but still isn't accepted at the Big Kid's table. And the Red Arrow/Cheshire dynamic is fantastic, especially if you know their history from the comic books.Keeping things a little light, Superboy and Miss Martian also enroll in public school, where the airheadedness of Miss Martian makes her an instant cheerleader candidate (of course!).  The school scene also had some nice winks and nods to longtime Titans fans, as Wendy and Marvin, Mal Duncan, Karen Beecher, and their teacher Lucas ""Snapper"" Carr all make an appearance.Terrors - Belle Reve prison freezes over as a plot is uncovered to get all the ice-power villains locked up in the same place at the same time.  The solution is to send in Superboy and Miss Martian undercover to try and put a stop to whatever villainous plan is afoot.I thought this was the weakest episode.  Superboy's giant chip on his shoulder makes him the least-interesting character of Young Justice, and Miss Martian's one-note character is just as bad, so any episode with those two in the lead is going to be disappointing. This episode also peppered the background with familiar villain faces, which was cool to see. (Although I can't figure out why The Riddler was made out to be such a punk, while The Icicle was treated as some kind of Top Dog ...)The best parts of this episode was the introduction of Amanda Waller and Professor Hugo Strange.  I love this true version of Amanda ""The Wall"" Waller instead of how she is currently appearing in the comics.  It is nice to see her in action again.  And Professor Hugo Strange, by virtue of his extreme weirdness, makes a great addition to any series.Homefront  There are rumors that one of the Young Justice members is a mole working for the other side, and distrust is heavy when their headquarters suddenly comes under attack by Red Inferno and Red Torpedo.  The team isn't strong enough to beat one Red Tornado robot, so how are they supposed to fight two?Artemis takes the spotlight in this episode, and she is turning into an interesting character.  We get a glimpse of her home life, of what lead her to take up the bow and follow Green Arrow.  The end of this episode came as a shocker as well.  I won't give it away, but prepare to be surprised.All in all, I thought these latest four episodes were a big jump in quality for Young Justice.  The series has found its voice, and is coming together--well, except for Miss Martian who still needs some improvement.  But these DVD releases ...Just don't buy them.  Don't do it.",3,Same as before ...,1330732800,"03 3, 2012",2012,5777,"['have', 'theory', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'expected', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Young', 'Justice', 'exist', 'mainly', 'online',
