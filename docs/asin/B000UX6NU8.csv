1097035,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000UX6NU8,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[8, 13]","Bobby Riley is the youngest of four siblings in a Chicago Irish-Catholic family.  With both parents deceased, Bobby retains strong emotional and physical ties to his sister and three boisterous older brothers, one of whom is a priest. His lover, Andy (""Mad TV""'s Michael McDonald) and his ""convenience female date"" (who is actually a lesbian friend), as well as his sister (who already knows he is gay) push him to come out to his brothers, but he has been procrastinating for many years, making the revelation tougher as time goes on.  When he finally reveals himself as gay, they first assume it is one of many practical jokes the brothers have played on each other over the years, and they don't believe him.  Finding out it is true causes different reactions from each brother, ranging from prayerful sympathy from his oldest brother (the priest) to near-rage from his youngest brother.  In an especially humorous sequence, Andy (the lover) accepts an invitation to have lunch with two of the brothers, and has some fun pointing out their prejudices born out of ignorance rather than any actual hate.Though I'm an only child, I've seen the dynamic in many close-knit Irish or Italian Catholic families, and the characterizations ring very true to me, as does the initial and subequent reactions to Bobby's outing of himself.  After all, if it has taken you 20-30 years to accept yourself as a gay man, you have to give others some time to make the same adjustment.  Original, nicely-done premise, presented in a well-paced, cohesive indie film that looks much better than its budget suggests it should be.  The lead character is played by Pete Jones, who also wrote and directed the screenplay, the second he has filmed since winning an HBO ""Project Greenlight"" competition for amateur filmmakers.DVD extras include deleted scenes and director commentary.

1097039,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000UX6NU8,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 8]","I have to give credit to Pete Jones, who wrote, directed and starred in this low-budget 2004 indie, for having the temerity to make a coming-out film when he is apparently straight. And therein lies the rub since Jones doesn't really lend an informed perspective to his protagonist's trying situation. He plays Bobby Riley, a Chicago advertising account executive who happens to be gay and happily partnered. He also happens to come from a traditional Irish-Catholic family, a sister who knows he's gay and three brothers who don't. The movie is primarily about Bobby's struggle to come out to his brothers now that their father has just passed away and the time has come for their annual fishing trip together. While one can envision how Bobby's admission would lead to liberation and tolerance, Jones also superficially belabors Bobby's angst to the aggravating point of making me indifferent to his fate.A lot of the problem I had with the movie is the predictable and often forced humor Jones employs to ingratiate the character to the viewer. In what strikes me as filmmaking laziness, he goes as far as breaking the fourth wall, speaking to the camera, and using freeze-frames to either provide thumbnail sketches of the principal characters or comment on the action. The set-up with the brothers is also pretty generic as they represent variations on the beer-guzzling stereotypes one would expect from a movie at least forty years older. Two are married - Luke is a pothead with twin daughters, and Connor is a John Sununu look-alike who surfs the Web for porn. Oldest brother Jack is a Catholic priest, which sets him up for the most challenging road toward acceptance. Once the key revelation occurs, the inevitable ramifications at least allow for the film's few honest moments, the most effective being Luke's angry voicemail message in response to what he sees as Bobby's betrayal.In his acting debut, the cherubic Jones makes little impression as the bedeviled Bobby. Nathan Fillion, who would later play the smitten doctor in the late Adrienne Shelly'sWaitress, fares the best among the actors portraying the brothers, and Michael McDonald ofMADtv(not the singer) is surprisingly credible as Bobby's partner Andy. Julie Pearl is forced to play Bobby's sister Maggie as the nagging voice of conscience in order to facilitate the contrived plot conceit that proves disappointing toward the end. Jeff Garlin (Curb Your Enthusiasm,I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With) shows up in a cameo as a blowhard agency honcho trying to recruit Bobby believing him to be straight. I appreciate how Jones does not wrap everything up nicely at the end, although he sadly uses a stereotypical fantasy swimming number to get his point across.

1097043,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000UX6NU8,Grady Harp,"[16, 19]","OUTING RILEY may feel a bit self serving, as though Bobby Riley, the main character of the film, is sitting in a Confessional Booth revealing his secret, and in fact that is certainly the case as the film was conceived, lived, written, directed and stars Pete Jones as Bobby. This may account for some of the awkward sense of some of the dialog: it is difficult to be up front about an issue with a history as embedded as the theme of this film.  But despite these minor flaws, this little film has a heart of gold and a cast of actors who bring it to life in a good way.Bobby Riley (Pete Jones) is an Irish Catholic closeted gay man living in Chicago with his partner Andy (Michael McDonald). Bobby is being pressured by Andy and by his informed sister Maggie (Julie Pearl) to come out to his family - a good Irish Catholic family of four brothers, a sister, and a dying father (Bob Riley). His facade with his brothers is a mime of voyeurism of 'chicks' and a beer drinking butch life. Each family member has a secret: Maggie can't hold a relationship and is unable to keep secrets; Connor (Stoney Westmoreland) is addicted to internet porn; Jack (Dev Kennedy) is a priest who has problems with the conflicts the church places on his own beliefs; Luke (the always outstanding Nathan Fillion) is a pothead.  Once Maggie decides she must out Bobby, the brothers are conflicted: homophobia raises its ugly head despite the bonds of close family ties. How the family comes to grips with Bobby's being gay, individually and as a family, is the crux of the tale.This is a fine cast (especially Fillion and Pearl) and the story rolls along at a fine pace.  At times it feels 'dishonest' but that is in the script, not the acting.  This is not a major film, but it just may be a helpful one to families and friends who are curious about the lifestyle of someone who has surprised them with a similar secret!

I thought the movie was refreshingly funny and a very, very accurate take on a Chicago Irish Catholic family. For better or worse, Midwestern values permeate this movie -- the competitiveness, the family secrets, the practical jokes and the assigned family roles from which the siblings have a difficult time breaking free - all ring very, very true. Right from the opening scene, we are introduced to these beliefs: ""People here, they don't stray from the blueprint. You're born, you go to school, you get a job, you meet a girl..."" So much is left unsaid and that's typical among ethnic families. And often they're bound by tradition; ""That's the way we've always done it, fercryinoutloud, why change it now?"" I suspect that some of the low ratings are from reviewers on either coast who `don't get' this important point. (Often, I scratched my head and wondered if I was watching the same movie.) Bobby just wants acceptance and love from his brothers, which seems to be a very powerful motivator for him. There were some laugh-out-loud funny lines.  Maggie: ""So how did you tell your family?"" Andy: (Shrugs) ""Actually, I didn't have to. I did musical theater in high school."" I thought it was a clever double entendre that Luke and Connor chose to meet his boyfriend at Weiner's Circle (one of the best places to get a Chicago-style hot dog). At the end of the scene Andy tosses out the funniest line of the film. But what our esteemed coastal viewers might have missed (because it went unsaid) was that by arranging a meeting with their brother's lover, Luke and Connor were ""checking out"" Andy. They're looking out for their little brother. Totally realistic and endearing. No, it's not a perfect movie by any means. The acting was OK; neither better or worse than other independent films.  There was a bit more T & A for my liking, but hey, they had to get the straight boyfriends in the seats somehow. Some humor was frat boy-ish and therefore not my taste.

His performance rings true to everything being a free-spirited Irishman is about.Strong language, dirty jokes, and adult situations abound throughout, so this is not for your tweeners to watch.This is a film that blatantly discussed family feelings and relationships about sexuality. It's not meant as a morality tale for those with anti-gay sentiments. Instead, it is meant as a romantic comedy and family drama for those who are a bit more open-minded.While I suppose this film will primarily resonate with and be viewed by a gay audience, it holds valuable interest to many families who have dealt with, or might deal with, similar issues. I watched my own gay Irish ex-partner go through similar conflict (and reactions to) his coming out in his very large Irish family.The commonalities that tie families together make this film stand out above the crowd.

The lead role of Bobby Riley was miscast, and really should have gone to a more experienced actor.Let me start with the negatives. For starters, parts of the movie seemed, confusingly, to be aimed at immature preteen straight boys. We are supposed to find it funny when a married father (of girls) sexually violates a woman? And we're supposed to be okay that the gay brother goes along just to fit in? Voyeurism may not be a physical assault, but it definitely is a deep violation. This film makes light of that, and tries to minimize the offense by saying ""she wanted it."" Classic blame-the-victim mentality. Most disgusting was when all the brothers, even the supposedly responsible oldest brother, burst into laughter during the apology. The joke was lost on me.If I put that horrifying moment out of my head, there's still lots wrong with this movie. There are too many random extra elements. The movie is told in the form a man narrating his life as if it were a movie. That works okay, but it was distracting when Bobby broke the fourth wall too much at certain points.The chemistry between the character of Bobby Riley and his boyfriend Andy, is simply not there. It's not believable that Bobby has real feelings for Andy through most of their scenes together. When you hear the commentary, Pete Jones talks about the difficulty of playing romantic scenes as a gay character, which is more proof that he was miscast. Also, to make that relationship stronger, it would have worked much better if Andy had been the catalyst that drove Bobby to come out, and generally been more central to the storyline.What's good about the movie is the chemistry between the brothers. That truly is believable. They really capture the dynamic of guys who grew up (or grew older, anyway) together since childhood. Nathan Fillion stands out among the cast. He shines as Luke, the inappropriate yet loving older brother who really wants to understand and remain close to Bobby. You can really feel his hurt at being lied to for years, even when he expresses it in an immature way. The scene where Luke and Andy meet works really well. That's where you get the sense that beneath all his confusion, Luke really loves his brother. Mike McDonald, who plays Andy, also gets a chance to show what a really good actor he is.My overall view of the movie is that it has a few good moments, but is mostly uninteresting. I feel bad criticizing, because I appreciate the fact that a straight mand would write and star in a gay themed movie. I just wish it was a better movie.",1,"not good acting, poor chemistry, misogynistic moments",1254960000,"10 8, 2009",2009,2642,"['movie', 'started', 'out', 'mediocre', 'did', 'get', 'better', 'course', '99', 'minutes', 'lead', 'role', 'Bobby', 'Riley', 'was', 'miscast', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'more', 'experienced', 'start', 'negatives', 'starters', 'parts', 'movie', 'seemed', 'confusingly', 'be', 'aimed', 'immature', 'preteen', 'straight', 'boys', 'are', 'supposed', 'find', 'funny', 'when', 'married', 'father', 'girls', 'sexually', 'woman', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'okay', 'gay', 'brother', 'along', 'just', 'fit', 'Voyeurism', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'physical', 'assault', 'definitely', 'deep', 'violation', 'film', 'light', 'tries', 'minimize', 'offense', 'saying', 'wanted', 'Classic', 'blame-the-victim', 'mentality', 'Most', 'disgusting', 'was', 'when', 'brothers', 'even', 'supposedly', 'responsible', 'oldest', 'brother', 'burst', 'laughter', 'apology', 'joke', 'was', 'lost', 'me.If', 'put', 'horrifying', 'moment', 'head', 'still', 'lots', 'wrong', 'movie', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'random', 'extra', 'elements', 'movie', 'told', 'form', 'man', 'narrating', 'life', 'were', 'movie', 'okay', 'was', 'distracting', 'when', 'Bobby', 'broke', 'fourth', 'wall', 'too', 'much', 'certain', 'points.The', 'chemistry', 'character', 'Bobby', 'Riley', 'boyfriend', 'Andy', 'simply', 'not', 'there', 'not', 'believable', 'Bobby', 'real', 'feelings', 'Andy', 'most', 'scenes', 'together', 'When', 'hear', 'commentary', 'Pete', 'Jones', 'talks', 'difficulty', 'playing', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'gay', 'character', 'more', 'proof', 'was', 'miscast', 'Also', 'make', 'relationship', 'stronger', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'much', 'better', 'Andy', 'had', 'been', 'catalyst', 'drove', 'Bobby', 'come', 'out', 'generally', 'been', 'more', 'central', 'storyline.What', 'good', 'movie', 'chemistry', 'brothers', 'truly', 'believable', 'really', 'capture', 'dynamic', 'guys', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'grew', 'older', 'anyway', 'together', 'childhood', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'out', 'cast', 'Luke', 'inappropriate', 'yet', 'loving', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'really', 'understand', 'remain', 'close', 'Bobby', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'hurt', 'being', 'lied', 'years', 'even', 'when', 'immature', 'way', 'scene', 'where', 'Luke', 'Andy', 'meet', 'really', 'well', 'where', 'get', 'sense', 'confusion', 'Luke', 'really', 'brother', 'Mike', 'McDonald', 'who', 'Andy', 'also', 'chance', 'show', 'what', 'really', 'good', 'actor', 'overall', 'view', 'movie', 'few', 'good', 'moments', 'mostly', 'uninteresting', 'feel', 'bad', 'criticizing', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'straight', 'mand', 'would', 'write', 'star', 'gay', 'themed', 'movie', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'better', 'movie']",Outing Riley
