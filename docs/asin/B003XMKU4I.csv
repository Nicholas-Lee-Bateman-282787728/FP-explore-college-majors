1370917,A3N95R1VKWROWF,B003XMKU4I,Christopher Schwinger,"[0, 1]","The review that is ranked as most helpful on this product is entirely correct:  this is not professional level quality like some sets distributed by the History Channel.  Not everyone would find it engaging because of the presentation and narration.  However, concerning content/material, it is quite interesting because of the statistical and espionage information and some interesting stories, and is well-written.  The title ""Hitler:  The Untold Story"" and other title ""Hitler:  Anecdotes, Myths, and Lies"" are not at all what the documentaries are about.  The first documentary, which is very long, is a history of the European war, not of Hitler's life.  The second documentary covers the significant campaigns of the war and includes the Pacific.  The third documentary is about U-boats.  I have enjoyed learning a great deal more about World War II through the documentary set.  Whether this would appeal to someone else depends on how much one is interested in the subject matter and whether one has an encyclopedic knowledge of WWII already.  I don't think I understood the magnitude of the number of people involved in every single campaign until I went through the 2nd documentary.  It provided me a better understanding (a ""big picture"" sense) of the war even though I already knew the essential facts about it.  The 3rd documentary on U-boats was most interesting to me of all.  I recommend this to people who are interested in understanding WWII in more depth and are not picky about how a documentary is presented.",4,"Really interesting in content, but be mindful that the presentation is not professional level quality",1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,1529,"['review', 'ranked', 'most', 'helpful', 'product', 'entirely', 'correct', 'not', 'professional', 'level', 'quality', 'sets', 'distributed', 'History', 'Channel', 'Not', 'everyone', 'would', 'find', 'engaging', 'presentation', 'narration', 'However', 'concerning', 'content/material', 'quite', 'interesting', 'statistical', 'espionage', 'information', 'interesting', 'stories', 'well-written', 'title', 'Hitler', 'Untold', 'Story', 'other', 'title', 'Hitler', 'Anecdotes', 'Myths', 'Lies', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'documentaries', 'are', 'first', 'documentary', 'very', 'long', 'history', 'European', 'war', 'not', 'Hitler', 'life', 'second', 'documentary', 'covers', 'significant', 'campaigns', 'war', 'Pacific', 'third', 'documentary', 'U-boats', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'learning', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'documentary', 'set', 'would', 'appeal', 'someone', 'else', 'how', 'much', 'one', 'interested', 'subject', 'matter', 'one', 'encyclopedic', 'knowledge', 'WWII', 'already', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'understood', 'magnitude', 'number', 'people', 'involved', 'single', 'campaign', 'went', '2nd', 'documentary', 'provided', 'better', 'understanding', 'big', 'picture', 'sense', 'war', 'even', 'already', 'knew', 'essential', 'facts', '3rd', 'documentary', 'U-boats', 'was', 'most', 'interesting', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'understanding', 'WWII', 'more', 'depth', 'are', 'not', 'picky', 'how', 'documentary', 'presented']",Hitler: The Untold Story

Miller,"[0, 0]","I agree largely with the ""rehashed"" story review.I found disk 1 to be quite refreshing based upon a strong, information-filled narrative from which I learned some new things.  Production values were low; for example, after a while, you'd notice that the maps were labeled in some Spanish-like language.  Oh, and the musical ""score"" is really, well, uh, bad.  I mean, how many Hitler movies use, over and over, Pachebel's Canon -- the favorite for ""typical"" weddings???  Just very odd.From Disk 2 things go downhill.  Disk 2 is, basically, an old U.S. information-services-like film, perhaps made shortly after the war.  New narration has been put over it.  To underscore the lack of any continuity across the 3 disks, note that MUCH of the footage that you see in Disk 2 was also used in Disk 1.Disk 3 is produced in a way similar to Disk 1.  It has a relatively dense (I say that in a good way) narrative and rather random or odd music backgrounds.  But as other reviewers have noted, it's about WWII era German submarines, not about Hitler.  But it's not all that bad for what it is.As noted elsewhere, one big problem is the deceptive labeling of the 3 disk set.I don't feel too bad about the $5 cost.",3,Disk 1 is the best; goes downhill from there,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,1204,"['agree', 'largely', 'rehashed', 'story', 'review.I', 'found', 'disk', '1', 'be', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'based', 'strong', 'information-filled', 'narrative', 'learned', 'new', 'things', 'Production', 'values', 'were', 'low', 'example', 'while', ""'d"", 'notice', 'maps', 'were', 'labeled', 'Spanish-like', 'language', 'Oh', 'musical', 'score', 'really', 'well', 'uh', 'bad', 'mean', 'how', 'many', 'Hitler', 'movies', 'use', 'Pachebel', 'Canon', 'favorite', 'typical', 'weddings', 'Just', 'very', 'odd.From', 'Disk', '2', 'things', 'go', 'downhill', 'Disk', '2', 'basically', 'old', 'U.S.', 'information-services-like', 'film', 'perhaps', 'made', 'shortly', 'war', 'New', 'narration', 'been', 'put', 'underscore', 'lack', 'continuity', '3', 'disks', 'note', 'MUCH', 'footage', 'see', 'Disk', '2', 'was', 'also', 'used', 'Disk', '1.Disk', '3', 'produced', 'way', 'similar', 'Disk', '1', 'relatively', 'dense', 'say', 'good', 'way', 'narrative', 'rather', 'random', 'odd', 'music', 'backgrounds', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'WWII', 'era', 'German', 'submarines', 'not', 'Hitler', 'not', 'bad', 'what', 'is.As', 'noted', 'elsewhere', 'one', 'big', 'problem', 'deceptive', 'labeling', '3', 'disk', 'set.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'too', 'bad', '5', 'cost']",Hitler: The Untold Story

The title of the DVD is flat-out untrue. In fact, I know many things about Hitler that this DVD missed.The other star was lost because it is a very cheaply produced DVD. Some examples: the narrator over-pronounces his words, which gets tedious. It seems he's incapable of using any contractions, and it sounds like an android is telling the story. Also, he stubbornly mis-pronounces some words repeatedly, such as saying ROOS-evelt rather than the more commonly used ROSE-evelt. He incorrectly pronounces it exactly as it's spelled. A minor point, but an example of how annoying the narration is at times. The graphics are cheesy, as is the music. Ah, the music! Wildly inappropriate at times, such as romantic symphonic music or peppy jazz music while showing intense, violent combat footage. And, the sound effects were lacking at times too. While showing British ships launching anti-submarine hedgehogs, they used the sound from the Soviet Katyusha rockets, or ""Stalin's Organ."" And in another scene with combat troops going at it, I swear I heard a Wilhelm Scream in there. You can look it up on youtube if you don't know what that is.This is a DVD that has definitely earned its place in the $5 bargain bin.

This is a great example of deceptive packaging. And let me explain why.First this is not a 12 hour series on Hitler as advertised.Secondly there is no documentary in this package actually called Hitler: The Untold Story. The name of the six hour slog contained herein is Hitler: Myths, Anecdotes and Lies... which is a misnomer as well. (It is not listed in IMDb.)There is also a three hour documentary misleadingly labeled ""The World at War: From Hitler to Hiroshima"", which again once you actually watch the DVD is called ""From Hitler to Hiroshima: The World at War"". This has nothing to do with the excellent Thames Television series from the 1970's entitled the ""World at War"" and is just labeled such to confuse the viewer. It is in fact one more tedious run through of the same material.Next there is also a three hour documentary on the U-Boats. This might be worth the couple of dollars shelled out for this thing. (Warning if you pay more than five dollars for this package you're going to have a tough time getting your money's worth.)Finally as to the Hitler documentary, which indeed is nearly six hours long... (And feels every minute of it.) If you've seen a couple of documentaries on Hitler you've seen it all before, except for perhaps 2%. I think approximately 70% of Triumph of the Will was cannibalized from a very poor quality print. And the rest is from predominantly obvious sources. Now I would be willing to forgive even that somewhat if they had any new slant on the subject. Some poor English historian is roped in with less than 6 minutes of talking head time amongst the 6 hours. Supposedly he narrates this whole shebang. But he doesn't. ( I wish he had.) Instead we get a very stilted individual talking with a strange American accent who can't pronounce certain words quite correctly. This could be the ""director"" Jose Delgado who is the ""write and director"" (sic).By the way this is from Mill Creek and Octapixx???Here's what this mess really looks like to me: With it's horrifying digital transition effects, it's constant and pointless musical score, it's untranslated Hitler speeches droning on through the background as random sound, it's fuzzy images; it all seems to have been crammed together on someone's old PC in about 1997 from preexisting source material (VHS?), without too much regard to content meshing with image.

I only spent $5 at a local store for it so I don't feel ripped off. That's all this DVD is worth, $5.",3,Somewhat interesting,1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,768,"['dvd', 'package', 'title', 'NOT', 'what', 'dvd', 'titles', 'are', 'nothing', 'untold', '34', 'documentary', '34', 'very', 'very', 'VERY', 'long', '34', 'documentary', '34', 'already', 'well', 'known', 'AND', 'told', 'facts.It', 'okay', 'being', 'highly', 'critical', 'documentaries', 'found', 'narrator', 'bland', 'monotoned', 'background', 'music', 'was', 'God', 'awful', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'period', 'war.After', 'watching', 'just', 'first', 'few', 'titles', 'first', 'DVD', 'found', 'falling', 'asleep', 'alot', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'guess', 'way', '34', 'documentary', '34', 'was', 'presented', 'just', 'awful', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'documentaries', 'somewhat', 'okay', 'still', 'keep', 'only', 'spent', '5', 'local', 'store', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'ripped', 'off', 'DVD', 'worth', '5']",Hitler: The Untold Story
1370932,A1CKZZBM4BV0TK,B003XMKU4I,Visa,"[6, 11]","Very good documentary - 12 hours of detailed information about Hitler. As a history teacher - it bothers me to see our American textbooks saying that America's refusal to join the league of Nations after WWI caused WWII - that is nothing but politically correct - revisionist history. This documentary points out how Germany, under Hitler, wanted to right the wrongs of 1918 - yes - it was the allies in Europe who cased WWII - because of their unjust treatment of Germany after WWI. An excellent buy for the true WWII enthusiast.Larry",4,Well worth the $4.99.00 Price,1309824000,"07 5, 2011",2011,535,"['Very', 'good', 'documentary', '12', 'hours', 'detailed', 'information', 'Hitler', 'history', 'teacher', 'see', 'American', 'textbooks', 'saying', 'America', 'refusal', 'join', 'league', 'Nations', 'WWI', 'caused', 'WWII', 'nothing', 'politically', 'correct', 'revisionist', 'history', 'documentary', 'points', 'out', 'how', 'Germany', 'Hitler', 'wanted', 'right', 'wrongs', '1918', 'yes', 'was', 'allies', 'Europe', 'who', 'cased', 'WWII', 'unjust', 'treatment', 'Germany', 'WWI', 'excellent', 'buy', 'true', 'WWII', 'enthusiast.Larry']",Hitler: The Untold Story
