Roberts ""GrayArea""","[2, 2]","Besides being supremely funny and entertaining to watch unsuspecting characters at a crime scene when they chase Patrick around after he cattle prods out of them information he needs to catalog and rank his deductions, being great fun to watch, it is also a good way for us to study people. This is an informative and educational tool in your attempt to read others. Jane has studied the clues and cues which are available to all of us if we knew about them.  If he is trying to get further info all he has to do is sound insulting or accusational, out of line and/or embarrassingly to  any potential suspect, then we watch as he watches their reactions, often having to run off as he is chased by an irate unsub. If needing to know more he prods them silly, until they see red, until he has a read, a piece to the puzzle, being able to set that piece in its appropriate place as he aids the law by being a great crime detective's adjunct professor. Especially nice is the way Baker's character eventually gets around to explaining to all the others why he concludes this or that about an unsub because of this or that reaction, smell, personality type having been found out, faults and strengths of each having been assessed, ruling in or out this or that, being able to prioritize the info as it comes in also going through his processor, it being an IQ-thing that finalizes the computations. From the Pilot into the show a few episodes all he appears to be is a jerk to the average viewer. We eventually learn there is a method to the madness he induces in others. Sounding, off the bat, before further explanations for his prickliness, it appears to be like the multiple misfirings of an intentional irritant, therefore as if being personal assaults, while in reality the reasoning behind why he does and says what he says is anything but personal.",5,"Studying People, A Graduate Course",1338940800,"06 6, 2012",2012,1852,"['being', 'supremely', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'unsuspecting', 'characters', 'crime', 'scene', 'when', 'chase', 'Patrick', 'around', 'cattle', 'prods', 'information', 'catalog', 'rank', 'deductions', 'being', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'also', 'good', 'way', 'study', 'people', 'informative', 'educational', 'tool', 'attempt', 'read', 'others', 'Jane', 'studied', 'clues', 'cues', 'are', 'available', 'knew', 'trying', 'get', 'further', 'info', 'do', 'sound', 'insulting', 'accusational', 'line', 'and/or', 'embarrassingly', 'potential', 'suspect', 'then', 'watch', 'reactions', 'often', 'having', 'run', 'off', 'chased', 'irate', 'unsub', 'needing', 'know', 'more', 'silly', 'see', 'red', 'read', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'being', 'able', 'set', 'piece', 'appropriate', 'place', 'law', 'being', 'great', 'crime', 'detective', 'adjunct', 'professor', 'Especially', 'nice', 'way', 'Baker', 'character', 'eventually', 'explaining', 'others', 'why', 'unsub', 'reaction', 'smell', 'personality', 'type', 'having', 'been', 'found', 'out', 'faults', 'strengths', 'having', 'been', 'assessed', 'ruling', 'being', 'able', 'prioritize', 'info', 'also', 'going', 'processor', 'being', 'IQ-thing', 'computations', 'Pilot', 'show', 'few', 'episodes', 'all', 'be', 'jerk', 'average', 'viewer', 'eventually', 'learn', 'method', 'madness', 'others', 'Sounding', 'bat', 'further', 'explanations', 'prickliness', 'be', 'multiple', 'misfirings', 'intentional', 'irritant', 'therefore', 'being', 'personal', 'assaults', 'reality', 'reasoning', 'why', 'what', 'anything', 'personal']","Mentalist, The:S3 (DVD)"

Lisbon will even be sidelined for one case, pushing the deadpan Cho (Tim Kang) into a not entirely welcome leadership role.  Grace Van Pelt (Amanda Rhigetti) takes up with a handsome and smooth talking FBI agent, much to the anguish of former boyfriend agent Rigsby (Owain Yeoman), but Van Pelt's new love may not be the man of her dreams.Patrick Jane barely survives an encounter with infamous serial killer Red John at the beginning of the season, and the pursuit of Red John will be a recurring theme.

The writing is consistently good, the crimes investigated require thought in figuring out the perpetrator, but what really makes the series work is the presence of the main character - the almost nonchalant mindreader Patrick Jane. Part of this is due to the inventiveness of the creator of the series, part of it is due to the script du jour, but the whole thing couldn't work as well without the subtle acting skills of Simon Baker. Baker knows who to keep the twinkle in his eye, even in the most potentially dangerous moments. He never pushes his skills to make the character look like a seer, but instead inserts his penetrating opinions in a way that makes the whole teams of investigators work well together. He is ably supported by Robin Tunney, Tim Kang (a far too underused actor), Amanda Righetti, Owain Yeoman, and of course boss men Terry Kinney and Gregory Itzin. It is a strong team playing out a clever idea for bringing justice. Each season gets stronger, especially this season with Simon Baker being given the opportunity to direct an episode - an done of the best ones!

The character Simon Baker plays (Patrick Jane) is utterly without equal in its depth and breadth. A complete biography of Jane can be constructed from watching the character develop: how he grew up, and how that formed his personality and philosophy of life, why the murder of his wife and daughter affected him so deeply that he could not let go of the need for murderous revenge, how he loved being a husband and father, why he has a two-layered personna - the clever, funny, kind heartedly manipulative, crime solving, no-boundaries CBI consultant on the surface, and the anguished, despairing, heartbroken, insomniac, near-psychotic, celibate (9 years and counting) killer just below it. (And he does kill, deliberately and in cold blood, in the Season 3 finale.) What other TV character can anyone name who is so well drawn? Most of the episodes are extremely well written and insightful. Some seem to be there to stretch out the series because it is such a money-maker, but that can't be helped and doesn't detract from the overall excellence.

1359831,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B003R0MF1W,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[0, 0]","As with the previous two seasons Patrick Jane (Simon Baker)continues to help CBI (California Bureau of Investigation)as they take on unusual cases too big for local law enforcement. He also gets a little closer to his serial killer nemesis Red John as he discovers that there might be a traitor within CBI informing Red John allowing him to stay one step ahead of Jane and the CBI team (Robin Tunney, the marvelously dry Tim Kang, Owaine Yeoman, and the beautiful Amanda Righetti). The stand-alone episodes allows Jane and the CBI team to tackle a number of fascinating cases that are a puzzle to the local police. During the season Jane and his team come under the scrutiny of J.J. LaRoche (Pruitt Taylor Vince of ""Identity"" fame)and must prove their innocence in the murder of a suspect.The show receives a very nice, sharp looking transfer. Colors and skin tones are accurate throughout and although blacks are occasionally crushed and there are some minor compression artifacts on the whole the regular DVD presentation looks particularly fine.The 5.1 audio mix isn't quite as active as some--remember this is a dialogue driven show with moments of action but it is active enough.The special features include a featurette with expert criminologists giving us an ""offender"" profile of Red John and suggesting what his motivation and plans are for the outcome of the game Red John plays with Jane throughout the series.""Red Moon"": Directed by Simon Baker"" gives us a glimpse of the work that went into the production for this episode directed by the series star.We also get ""Lost Evidence"" featuring cut scenes.Still missing are any meaningful commentary tracks from the cast and crew (that would be a nice plus for this set) or even a trivia track on the Red John linked episodes providing us with back ground from season to season for each episode. The latter would be nice simply because the key episodes are spread over the three season run (to date)with more coming in season four. For those who have already seen season three it would have been nice for a commentary track on the final episode to discuss the outcome and it's resolution in the first episode of season four.On the whole season three more than stands up to the first two seasons with further character development and a better understanding of Patrick Jane's character (and Lisbon's)which, surprisingly, creates an even large aura of mystery surrounding them.Highly recommended.",5,The clever third season ends with a **BIG** surprise ending although a bit lacking in special features,1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,2451,"['previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'Patrick', 'Jane', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'help', 'CBI', 'California', 'Bureau', 'Investigation', 'take', 'unusual', 'cases', 'too', 'big', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'also', 'little', 'closer', 'serial', 'killer', 'nemesis', 'Red', 'John', 'might', 'be', 'traitor', 'CBI', 'informing', 'Red', 'John', 'allowing', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'Jane', 'CBI', 'team', 'Robin', 'Tunney', 'marvelously', 'dry', 'Tim', 'Kang', 'Owaine', 'Yeoman', 'beautiful', 'Amanda', 'Righetti', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'Jane', 'CBI', 'team', 'tackle', 'number', 'fascinating', 'cases', 'are', 'puzzle', 'local', 'police', 'season', 'Jane', 'team', 'come', 'scrutiny', 'J.J.', 'LaRoche', 'Pruitt', 'Taylor', 'Vince', 'Identity', 'fame', 'must', 'prove', 'innocence', 'murder', 'suspect.The', 'show', 'very', 'nice', 'sharp', 'looking', 'transfer', 'Colors', 'skin', 'tones', 'are', 'accurate', 'blacks', 'are', 'occasionally', 'crushed', 'are', 'minor', 'compression', 'artifacts', 'whole', 'regular', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'particularly', 'fine.The', '5.1', 'audio', 'mix', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'active', 'remember', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'show', 'moments', 'action', 'active', 'enough.The', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'featurette', 'expert', 'criminologists', 'giving', 'offender', 'profile', 'Red', 'John', 'suggesting', 'what', 'motivation', 'plans', 'are', 'outcome', 'game', 'Red', 'John', 'Jane', 'series', 'Red', 'Moon', 'Directed', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'glimpse', 'work', 'went', 'production', 'episode', 'directed', 'series', 'star.We', 'also', 'get', 'Lost', 'Evidence', 'featuring', 'cut', 'scenes.Still', 'missing', 'are', 'meaningful', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'cast', 'crew', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'plus', 'set', 'even', 'trivia', 'track', 'Red', 'John', 'linked', 'episodes', 'providing', 'back', 'ground', 'season', 'season', 'episode', 'latter', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'simply', 'key', 'episodes', 'are', 'spread', 'three', 'season', 'run', 'date', 'more', 'coming', 'season', 'four', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'season', 'three', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'commentary', 'track', 'final', 'episode', 'discuss', 'outcome', 'resolution', 'first', 'episode', 'season', 'four.On', 'whole', 'season', 'three', 'more', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'further', 'character', 'development', 'better', 'understanding', 'Patrick', 'Jane', 'character', 'Lisbon', 'surprisingly', 'even', 'large', 'aura', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'them.Highly', 'recommended']","Mentalist, The:S3 (DVD)"
