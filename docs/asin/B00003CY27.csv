As humorous as is Leslie Jordan's cross-dresser portrayal, it quickly becomes apparent that most of the fun being poked is aimed at his hillbilliness and not his swishiness.

Yet, half the characters show no sign of sordidness, and some are straight-laced and preachily moralistic.  About white trash this movie aint.

542159,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00003CY27,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 3]","SORDID LIVES opens with a singer at a microphone, a woman with bleached hair that shows black roots, several tattoos, and stragetically placed chewing gum as she rehearses a profanity-laced juke joint song.  She looked familiar--and when she sang her voice was even more so.  Who on earth was she?  My jaw dropped with a clatter.  Oh My God.  It can't be!  But yes, it is.  That really is Olivia Newton-John!Written by Del Shores, SORDID LIVES was a popular ticket and award-winning comedy on the Los Angeles stage, but when Shores sought a movie deal every studio turned him down flat.  Shores presevered nonetheless, and the result was an awkwardly self-directed, extremely low budget movie filmed in high definition that had the look of a cheap 1960s soap opera.  Surprisingly, though, these qualities actually suited the material: a torrid, vulgar, trashy, and unexpectedly spiritual tale of a small-town Texas funeral gone to pot in the most disastrous ways imaginable.The plot is difficult to describe, but it revolves around a ""good Christian"" grandmother who has died under unsavory circumstances: shacked up with a neighbor's husband in a cheap motel, she tripped over her lover's wooden legs and cracked her head on the bathroom sink! Now her lover G.W. (Beau Bridges) is getting drunk down at the bar while her daughters Latrelle and Lavonda (Bonnie Bedelia and Ann Walker) bicker with each other over the funeral arrangements--and whether or not Brother-Boy (Leslie Jordan) should be allowed to come to the funeral from the mental hospital where he has been locked up for twenty-three years because he thinks he's Tammy Wynette.The film is a hair slow to get underway, but once it does it goes off like a rocket.  There's G.W.'s humiliated wife Noleta (Delta Burke), an aging barfly named Juanita (Sarah Hunley), the psychiatrist from hell (Rosemay Alexander), angst-ridden gay grandson Ty (Kurt Geiger), bar owner Wardell (Newell Alexander) and his half-wit brother Odell (Earl H. Bullock)--and the aforementioned ex-con and juke-joint singer Bitsy Mae (Newton-John.)  And it is clear that each and every one of them are having a wonderful time tearing strips off the wickedly funny script, which offers one outrageous line and scene after another.For all the talent on display--Delta Burke, Kirk Geiger, and Bonnie Bedelia are particularly memorable--the big noise is actress Beth Grant, who is probably best known for her turn in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE.  Cast here as Sissy, sister to the dead woman, she is everything that is appallingly funny: snapping a rubber band on her wrist because she's trying to quit smoking, fanning herself up the legs of her shorts, and trying to make peace in the family before everbody meets up at the church for funerial hysteria.  Her performance is one-of-a-kind and knock-you-flat at the same time.The DVD comes with several extras, including cut scenes and an enjoyable audio commentary.  I'm not all that fond of contemporary comedy--I usually find it both sterile and saccharine--but I tell you here and now: SORDID LIVES, for all its flaws, made me laugh until I cried.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",5,You Have Got To Get Over This Tammy Wynette Fixation!,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,3142,"['SORDID', 'LIVES', 'singer', 'microphone', 'woman', 'bleached', 'hair', 'black', 'roots', 'several', 'tattoos', 'stragetically', 'placed', 'chewing', 'gum', 'profanity-laced', 'juke', 'joint', 'song', 'looked', 'familiar', 'when', 'sang', 'voice', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Who', 'earth', 'was', 'jaw', 'dropped', 'clatter', 'Oh', 'My', 'God', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'yes', 'really', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'Written', 'Del', 'Shores', 'SORDID', 'LIVES', 'was', 'popular', 'ticket', 'award-winning', 'comedy', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'stage', 'when', 'Shores', 'sought', 'movie', 'deal', 'studio', 'turned', 'down', 'flat', 'Shores', 'presevered', 'nonetheless', 'result', 'was', 'awkwardly', 'self-directed', 'extremely', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'filmed', 'high', 'definition', 'had', 'look', 'cheap', '1960s', 'soap', 'opera', 'Surprisingly', 'though', 'qualities', 'actually', 'suited', 'material', 'torrid', 'vulgar', 'trashy', 'unexpectedly', 'spiritual', 'tale', 'small-town', 'Texas', 'funeral', 'gone', 'pot', 'most', 'disastrous', 'ways', 'imaginable.The', 'plot', 'difficult', 'describe', 'good', 'Christian', 'grandmother', 'who', 'died', 'unsavory', 'circumstances', 'shacked', 'up', 'neighbor', 'husband', 'cheap', 'motel', 'tripped', 'lover', 'wooden', 'legs', 'cracked', 'head', 'bathroom', 'sink', 'Now', 'lover', 'G.W', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'getting', 'drunk', 'down', 'bar', 'daughters', 'Latrelle', 'Lavonda', 'Bonnie', 'Bedelia', 'Ann', 'Walker', 'bicker', 'other', 'funeral', 'arrangements', 'not', 'Brother-Boy', 'Leslie', 'Jordan', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'come', 'funeral', 'mental', 'hospital', 'where', 'been', 'locked', 'up', 'twenty-three', 'years', 'Tammy', 'Wynette.The', 'film', 'hair', 'slow', 'get', 'underway', 'once', 'rocket', 'G.W', 'humiliated', 'wife', 'Noleta', 'Delta', 'Burke', 'aging', 'barfly', 'named', 'Juanita', 'Sarah', 'Hunley', 'psychiatrist', 'hell', 'Rosemay', 'Alexander', 'angst-ridden', 'gay', 'grandson', 'Ty', 'Kurt', 'Geiger', 'bar', 'owner', 'Wardell', 'Newell', 'Alexander', 'half-wit', 'brother', 'Odell', 'Earl', 'H.', 'Bullock', 'aforementioned', 'ex-con', 'juke-joint', 'singer', 'Bitsy', 'Mae', 'Newton-John', 'clear', 'one', 'are', 'having', 'wonderful', 'time', 'tearing', 'strips', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'script', 'one', 'outrageous', 'line', 'scene', 'talent', 'display', 'Delta', 'Burke', 'Kirk', 'Geiger', 'Bonnie', 'Bedelia', 'are', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'big', 'noise', 'actress', 'Beth', 'Grant', 'who', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'turn', 'LITTLE', 'MISS', 'SUNSHINE', 'Cast', 'here', 'Sissy', 'sister', 'dead', 'woman', 'everything', 'appallingly', 'funny', 'snapping', 'rubber', 'band', 'wrist', 'trying', 'quit', 'smoking', 'fanning', 'legs', 'shorts', 'trying', 'make', 'peace', 'family', 'everbody', 'up', 'church', 'funerial', 'hysteria', 'performance', 'one-of-a-kind', 'knock-you-flat', 'same', 'time.The', 'DVD', 'several', 'extras', 'including', 'cut', 'scenes', 'enjoyable', 'audio', 'commentary', ""'m"", 'not', 'fond', 'contemporary', 'comedy', 'usually', 'find', 'sterile', 'saccharine', 'tell', 'here', 'now', 'SORDID', 'LIVES', 'flaws', 'made', 'cried.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",Sordid Lives

I was not bowled over as they obviously were - quoting lines from it and all but wetting themselves remembering scenes from the film.Now, I'm not a hard guy to make laugh, but there was only one point in this film where I actually laughed out loud. Other than that, I found Sordid Lives to be just tediously amateurish and more than a bit forced.I love Southern humor and even poking fun at Southerners: I can't tell you how much I love Greater Tuna, Fried Green Tomatos, Steel Magnolias, etc. but this just didn't cut it for me.The cast is a who's who of excellent character actors: Beau Bridges, Bonnie Bedelia, Leslie Jordan, Olivia Newton-John (for pete's sake!), Erik Krieger, Delta Burke and gobs of others. No, it's not a shortage of talent that this film lacks. I found that it was a lack of a cohesive direction that made me wince more than once.There's a scene with Ty (an out of the closet to everyone but his parents young man who lives in West Hollywood) talking to his ex-girlfriend in the reception area of their therapist...well, as a theatre director, I can only tell you that the performances during this one scene are so painfully badly acted and the pregnant pauses between the lines are so large you could drive fleets of trucks through them.There are various filming techniques that Del Shores (the director) uses that are just hackneyed: filming from behind a person's back so that only the back of one person's head and the facing person are seen.

Rushton,"[0, 1]","Last night I sat down with a glass of wine, turned on the DVD of SORDID LIVES and had an enjoyable time watching this sensitive, emotional and soulful movie. I didn't know exactly what to expect after reading on the artwork 'A Black Comedy about White Trash' albeit I soon found out that's exactly what it was. The ensemble cast worked very well with each other and delivered some crackling dialogue made possible by the writer, Del Shores. I loved lines like: ""you got as big as a bus and who the hell wants to climb a mountain"" and in the Thelma and Louise sequence: ""what did I do?"" and the reply ""you're living and you're breathing.""It was nice to see Olivia Newton-John (one of my countrymen - or should that be women) with that amazing Texas accent. She has come a long way since the days of Grease. I could associate with so many of the characters in this story as they reminded me of so many who had passed through my life at one time or another.The lead up to (extracting the fox fur) and the funeral would have to be worth the price of this DVD alone. Tragic as it might be Grandma lying there in the coffin and everyone revealing their thoughts was a joy. One almost expected Grandma to come alive again. On that note make sure you watch right through to after the end credits for a real surprise.The performance of Ty(played by Kirk Geiger) and the sensitivity with which he delivered his lines brought a tear to my eyes as it did his. Somewhere in all this I could feel similar emotions which I had encountered over the years. Where is Kirk Geiger today? It seems he has dropped off the face of the earth after this performance as he is not in the same role in the TV series. From what I can ascertain (after checking imdb) he was portraying a much younger character than what he really was. On that note if anyone has further details on what he might be doing I would certainly appreciate knowing.To conclude I must mention the Art Direction which I found to be extremely striking. It appeared a great deal of thought was put into  coloring and design, especially the beautiful paintings in the therapists office) and worked so well with the blending of the costumesLooking forward to Southern baptist Sissies on it's DVD release.",4,I will survive,1231372800,"01 8, 2009",2009,2244,"['Last', 'night', 'sat', 'down', 'glass', 'wine', 'turned', 'DVD', 'SORDID', 'LIVES', 'had', 'enjoyable', 'time', 'watching', 'sensitive', 'emotional', 'soulful', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', 'reading', 'artwork', 'Black', 'Comedy', 'White', 'Trash', 'albeit', 'soon', 'found', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'other', 'delivered', 'crackling', 'dialogue', 'made', 'possible', 'writer', 'Del', 'Shores', 'loved', 'lines', 'got', 'as', 'big', 'bus', 'who', 'hell', 'climb', 'mountain', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'sequence', 'what', 'did', 'do', 'reply', ""'re"", 'living', ""'re"", 'breathing', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'one', 'countrymen', 'should', 'be', 'women', 'amazing', 'Texas', 'accent', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'days', 'Grease', 'could', 'associate', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'story', 'reminded', 'so', 'many', 'who', 'had', 'passed', 'life', 'one', 'time', 'another.The', 'lead', 'up', 'extracting', 'fox', 'fur', 'funeral', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'price', 'DVD', 'alone', 'Tragic', 'might', 'be', 'Grandma', 'lying', 'there', 'coffin', 'everyone', 'revealing', 'thoughts', 'was', 'joy', 'One', 'almost', 'expected', 'Grandma', 'come', 'alive', 'again', 'note', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'right', 'end', 'real', 'surprise.The', 'performance', 'Ty', 'played', 'Kirk', 'Geiger', 'sensitivity', 'delivered', 'lines', 'brought', 'tear', 'eyes', 'did', 'Somewhere', 'could', 'feel', 'similar', 'emotions', 'had', 'encountered', 'years', 'Where', 'Kirk', 'Geiger', 'today', 'dropped', 'off', 'face', 'earth', 'performance', 'not', 'same', 'role', 'TV', 'series', 'what', 'can', 'ascertain', 'checking', 'imdb', 'was', 'portraying', 'much', 'younger', 'character', 'what', 'really', 'was', 'note', 'anyone', 'further', 'details', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'doing', 'would', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'knowing.To', 'conclude', 'must', 'mention', 'Art', 'Direction', 'found', 'be', 'extremely', 'striking', 'appeared', 'great', 'deal', 'thought', 'was', 'put', 'coloring', 'design', 'especially', 'beautiful', 'paintings', 'therapists', 'office', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'blending', 'costumesLooking', 'forward', 'Southern', 'baptist', 'Sissies', 'DVD', 'release']",Sordid Lives

There were a couple of laugh-out-loud lines, true, but actually, my friend had already pretty much quoted them all before I got a chance to view the film. And even the best lines get lost admid the overall noise in this poorly paced, inconsistently directed and horribly photographed effort.  A talented cast, including Bonnie Bedelia, Beau Bridges, Delta Burke, Beth Grant and many others, can't really save the film.  The best moments belong to the film's gay characters (played by Leslie Jordan and Kirk Geiger, and a surprisingly effective Olivia Newton-John).  They manage to preserve a little dignity throughout the loopy proceedings.  The other, ""straight"" characters are way too archly drawn for the actors to be able to work with.

She is survived by a sister who has just stopped smoking three days before this untimely death and will not be able to stay on the wagon. Peggy has two daughters with large hair, a son whom she has banished to a mental institution 23 years ago because he is a cross-dresser-- and is in love with Tammy Wynette-- and a  gay grandson who has fled Texas for a more tolerant Los Angeles.

542173,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00003CY27,Joseph Haschka,"[29, 32]","As SORDID LIVES opens, Sissy (Beth Grant) is awaiting the funeral of her sister Peggy, who recently died in a cheap motel room after tripping over the detached wooden legs of her adulterous lover, G.W. (Beau Bridges), and smashing her head against the bathroom porcelain. As if Sissy doesn't have problems enough in the wake of five failed marriages, she's struggling to quit smoking, popping Valium like candy, and having to cope with the dysfunctions of assorted family members. Niece Latrelle (Bonnie Bedelia), whose husband is off with Jimmy Carter building homes for the poor, is in denial over the homosexuality of son Ty (Kirk Geiger), an aspiring actor out in L.A., and contesting the decision of her sister LaVonda (Ann Walker) to clothe Mom in her favorite mink stole for the burial in 110-degree Texas heat. Meanwhile, Peggy's son Earl (Leslie Jordan), a homosexual transvestite, has been confined to a mental institution for the past twenty years. Out in SoCal, Ty is suffering a sexual identity crisis, and is on his twenty-seventh therapist.SORDID LIVES, a politically correct film espousing gay rights in a heavy Texas accent, won't appeal to everyone, but several of the performances are surprisingly excellent. Jordan is positively superb as Earl, who spends his life dressed up as CW singer Tammy Wynette, and has a permanent gig entertaining his fellow inmates in the asylum.Also exceptional is Rosemary Alexander as the sexually frustrated Dr. Eve Bolinger, the institution psychologist assigned to Earl's case. Eve's career, as well as a lucrative book deal and an appearance on Oprah, are all dependent on her ability to successfully de-homosexualize her charge. Therapy has not progressed well after sixty-eight sessions, and Eve is prepared to take Earl's problem in hand, so to speak. The single, on-screen session between Earl and his shrink is brilliantly scripted and worth the price of the video rental, and then some.A very nice touch is Olivia Newton-John as Bitzy Mae Harling, an ex-con and local bad girl, whose timely live performance of topical songs augments recorded Tammy Wynette vocals. Delta Burke as Noleta, G.W.'s unhappy spouse, is also effective, as is Sissy's striking hairdo.Sometimes, the film's humor becomes shrill and a little forced. For that reason,  I'm lopping off a fifth star. However, though SORDID LIVES is perhaps not suitable for screening at a Southern Baptist potluck, it's one that may offer a pleasant surprise if selected off the rental store shelf as a &quot;well, why not?&quot; afterthought.",4,White trash have their problems too,1062288000,"08 31, 2003",2003,2559,"['SORDID', 'LIVES', 'Sissy', 'Beth', 'Grant', 'awaiting', 'funeral', 'sister', 'Peggy', 'who', 'recently', 'died', 'cheap', 'motel', 'room', 'tripping', 'detached', 'wooden', 'legs', 'adulterous', 'lover', 'G.W', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'smashing', 'head', 'bathroom', 'porcelain', 'Sissy', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', 'enough', 'wake', 'five', 'failed', 'marriages', 'struggling', 'quit', 'smoking', 'popping', 'Valium', 'candy', 'having', 'cope', 'dysfunctions', 'assorted', 'family', 'members', 'Niece', 'Latrelle', 'Bonnie', 'Bedelia', 'husband', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'building', 'homes', 'poor', 'denial', 'homosexuality', 'son', 'Ty', 'Kirk', 'Geiger', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'L.A.', 'contesting', 'decision', 'sister', 'LaVonda', 'Ann', 'Walker', 'clothe', 'Mom', 'favorite', 'mink', 'stole', 'burial', '110-degree', 'Texas', 'heat', 'Meanwhile', 'Peggy', 'son', 'Earl', 'Leslie', 'Jordan', 'homosexual', 'transvestite', 'been', 'confined', 'mental', 'institution', 'past', 'twenty', 'years', 'SoCal', 'Ty', 'suffering', 'sexual', 'identity', 'crisis', 'twenty-seventh', 'therapist.SORDID', 'LIVES', 'politically', 'correct', 'film', 'espousing', 'gay', 'rights', 'heavy', 'Texas', 'accent', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'everyone', 'several', 'performances', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'excellent', 'Jordan', 'positively', 'superb', 'Earl', 'who', 'life', 'dressed', 'up', 'CW', 'singer', 'Tammy', 'Wynette', 'permanent', 'gig', 'entertaining', 'fellow', 'inmates', 'asylum.Also', 'exceptional', 'Rosemary', 'Alexander', 'sexually', 'frustrated', 'Dr.', 'Eve', 'Bolinger', 'institution', 'psychologist', 'assigned', 'Earl', 'case', 'Eve', 'career', 'as', 'well', 'lucrative', 'book', 'deal', 'appearance', 'Oprah', 'are', 'dependent', 'ability', 'successfully', 'de-homosexualize', 'charge', 'Therapy', 'not', 'progressed', 'well', 'sixty-eight', 'sessions', 'Eve', 'prepared', 'take', 'Earl', 'problem', 'hand', 'so', 'speak', 'single', 'on-screen', 'session', 'Earl', 'shrink', 'brilliantly', 'scripted', 'price', 'video', 'rental', 'then', 'some.A', 'very', 'nice', 'touch', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'Bitzy', 'Mae', 'Harling', 'ex-con', 'local', 'bad', 'girl', 'timely', 'live', 'performance', 'topical', 'songs', 'augments', 'recorded', 'Tammy', 'Wynette', 'vocals', 'Delta', 'Burke', 'Noleta', 'G.W', 'unhappy', 'spouse', 'also', 'effective', 'Sissy', 'striking', 'hairdo.Sometimes', 'film', 'humor', 'shrill', 'little', 'forced', 'reason', ""'m"", 'lopping', 'off', 'fifth', 'star', 'However', 'SORDID', 'LIVES', 'perhaps', 'not', 'suitable', 'screening', 'Southern', 'Baptist', 'potluck', 'one', 'may', 'offer', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'selected', 'off', 'rental', 'store', 'shelf', 'quot', 'well', 'why', 'not', 'quot', 'afterthought']",Sordid Lives

The story could have been tightened up on the editing room floor and the end product would have been funnier.  (Think Designing Women with a few too many long scenes that go out of control; Linda Bloodworth-Thomason knew when to make a point, or a joke, and then move on.)However, if you gloss over some relatively minor flaws, you will surely laugh out loud more than once and probably enjoy the hilarious tongue-in-cheek songs by Olivia Newton-John.It's certainly fresh material done to extremes.

Many people, for example, tend to appreciate that New York brand of comedy, like you would find on Seinfeld. Others tend to like a more slapstick variety like something Mel Brooks or Gene Wilder would come up with. Still there is the dry wit type such as Charlie Sheen. I go into this because I want to make a point that SORDID LIVES is not the kind of humor everyone will appreciate and for a good review, it should be qualified as to just what type of audience would like it. Personally, I don't remember very many movies that made me laugh as much as this one.This comedy would fall under the genre of redneck, white trash, hick, small town Texas, trailer trash or any such other similar descriptions. Let me put it this way, if you would find it hilarious to watch an old bar tramp putting on her lipstick without removing the cigarette from her mouth, then by all means, buy this movie!We are subjected to a seemingly endless array of gay themed movies these days, and I don't normally like any of them, but here it is presented in a mockingly hysterical fashion as one is trying to stay in the closet, another comes to the realization of his gayness, and a third is being treated by a semi-psychotic therapist who is willing to go to any length to cure him of it. Also, anyone who has ever endured the agony of quitting smoking will die laughing watching dear old Aunt Sissy struggle with her addiction.This movie is brilliantly cast. The filming, which looks almost like it was shot with a home movie camera, adds ambience to this film. I wouldn't normally like that type of filming, but here, it is a perfect fit.

The homes, fashions, and concerns are so dated that the occasional semi-contemporary references (such as to Oprah or ""Thelma and Louise"") are jarring.  Perhaps the writer expects us to believe that contemporary Texas is stuck in such a time warp, with no cable tv, no vcrs, no convenience stores, and a cast of characters who consume tuna casseroles and fight over mink stoles.One of the characters, a drag queen named ""Brother Boy,"" has been in a mental institution for 23 years, undergoing ""de-homosexualization"" therapy.  Someone needed to consult a copy of the DSM, which removed ""homosexuality"" as a therapeutic condition in 1973 -- long before he got there. The evil psychotherapist believes that her de-homosexualization technique (it involves thinking about women while you. . .you know) will make her rich and famous.  It will only get her kicked out of the APA.  And transvestism has never been grounds for institutionalization.Another character has moved to Los Angeles because he ""couldn't be who is"" in Texas. He's  never heard of the huge gay communities in Dallas, Houston, Austin, and San Antonio?  Evidently they do not exist, as even in L.A. he has had to undergo 27 years of psychotherapy and long periods of dating women before ""accepting himself.""  He agonizes over coming out even to his friends in the hip L.A. theater community.  They accept it -- big surprise -- so he goes home to Texas and informs Mom, who just wants to know if he's ""the man"" or ""the woman.""If this film were set in 1963, I could buy it, but not in 2003.

White Trailer Trash may not be apropos for this collection of oddities because these people are so damn funny. Don't think their intention is to be funny, but they are all just a little bit left of center. They are living their lifestyles or not, but they are doing this in their own way.The beginning of the movie starts at a slow pace but soon builds to a crescendo that will have you laughing til your sides hurt.  Sissy Hickey is on the phone discussing the demise of her sister. A rather unfortunate incident of tripping over the wooden legs of her married lover in a third rate motel. Now, the two daughters, Latrelle played by Bonnie Bedelia, and Noletta played by Delta Burke, are arguing over whether mom should be buried in her fur wrap in the middle of summer.  This done over a table full of southern fried food sent in by neighbors.  The talk turns to  Noletta's husband, the lover with the wooden legs, mom's son-in-law. And then turns to Boy Brother, their younger bro, who dresses in women's clothing and has spent the past 20 years in the insane asylum. Latrelle's son is in Hollywood and acting in gay plays.  The curious incident of the wooden legs has made the family a laughing stock and how to deal with this?In the meantime Boy Brother and his psychiatrist, Dr Eve Bolinger, are undergoing his therapy. Dr Bolinger is going to cure Boy Brother of his homosexuality and make her so famous she will appear on Oprah. However Boy Brother is not cooperating, He does not want to change. So, there appears to be a stand-off.The problems of each family member and the collective are enough to make a grown man cry. However, in this case, we may be down on our knees gasping from our laughter. How this family comes together is a mystery and the country western singer, played by Olivia Newton John , sings the family back home.  Not a laugh a minute but funny enough to keep us all off-base.""Like a live-action version of ""King of the Hill"" in hyperdrive,  features some ornery down-homers who remain convinced of their common sense even when every move puts them in deeper doo-doo.

542204,AF2UOFC8BTHLC,B00003CY27,"""yaaah69""","[6, 6]","Sordid lives, is one of the funniest flicks to come around, and for me to say that, really means its great, as I do not like most comedies. I can count the ones I like in the last 10 years on my fingers and have some digits left over. Hurrah for Del Shores, his cast and crew. I can believe that everyone on the set had a great time and laughed a lot. Beau Bridges was quite funny as the lover of the Ingram's clans mother. who stumbles over Bridges wooden legs after an affair in a motel and dies, morbid, not by a long shot. The laughs get better. Delta Burke is superb as the jilted wife and has lost mucho weight since &quot;Designing Women.&quot; But, the Oscar goes to Leslie Jordan, (Earl Brother Boy, Ingram) who has been sent to the loony bin to have him straightened out. His scenes with hi therapist is so funny I actually cried I laughed so hard, and his closing scene at the funeral is beyond belief.Folks if you missed this one the first go round, please for your own sake rent it, buy it, you will not be sorry. This film is rated fff for funny, funny, funny. But if you are one of those tight lipped southerners who cannot laugh at the wild side of life, stay far away.I rate this flick 5/5 or 10/10ciao yaaah69",5,"TEXANS, CAN BE FUNNY!!",1084924800,"05 19, 2004",2004,1227,"['Sordid', 'lives', 'one', 'funniest', 'flicks', 'come', 'say', 'really', 'great', 'do', 'not', 'most', 'comedies', 'can', 'count', 'ones', 'like', 'last', '10', 'years', 'fingers', 'have', 'digits', 'left', 'over', 'Hurrah', 'Del', 'Shores', 'cast', 'crew', 'can', 'believe', 'everyone', 'set', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'laughed', 'lot', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'was', 'quite', 'funny', 'lover', 'Ingram', 'clans', 'mother', 'who', 'Bridges', 'wooden', 'legs', 'affair', 'motel', 'dies', 'morbid', 'not', 'long', 'shot', 'laughs', 'get', 'better', 'Delta', 'Burke', 'superb', 'jilted', 'wife', 'lost', 'mucho', 'weight', 'quot', 'Designing', 'Women.', 'quot', 'Oscar', 'Leslie', 'Jordan', 'Earl', 'Brother', 'Boy', 'Ingram', 'who', 'been', 'sent', 'loony', 'bin', 'have', 'straightened', 'out', 'scenes', 'hi', 'therapist', 'so', 'funny', 'actually', 'cried', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'closing', 'scene', 'funeral', 'belief.Folks', 'missed', 'one', 'first', 'go', 'round', 'please', 'own', 'sake', 'rent', 'buy', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'sorry', 'film', 'rated', 'fff', 'funny', 'funny', 'funny', 'are', 'one', 'tight', 'lipped', 'southerners', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'laugh', 'wild', 'side', 'life', 'stay', 'far', 'away.I', 'rate', 'flick', '5/5', '10/10ciao', 'yaaah69']",Sordid Lives

I usually love low budget movies with off story lines. But this was just horrible. HORRID acting slow plot and just bad filmaking all together. Please dont waste your money.
