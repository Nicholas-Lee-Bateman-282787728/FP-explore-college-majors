1511073,A35LWA8VY66G8F,B0066E6VV6,Daniel G. Madigan,"[0, 0]","A better film than critics reviewed.James Franciscus is excellent here, and in the scenes with Genvieve Page  he and she explode wih sexual chemistry. Her acting is a good reason to own this film, and to see Mary Astor in a late film, wonderfiully showing how to act on screen.Suzanne Pleshette should have had big oles and this film shows wjhy..she, like Angie Dickenson, were given little to work with, but here Suzanne Pleshette works and delivers a nuanced performance that is close to the high water mark of her rival, Genvieve Page.The co-stars are superb, as they continually give the sense of the decadence of the publishing world, the usual compromises, but also too the hatreds that fester and reek havoc on Fransiscus as he begins his roller coaster ride as a new novelist. This the sort of film he was so famous for..uncovering the evil and making adultry, not a big deal in 1964 films, cause death and chaos of all varieties throughout the film.Delmar Daves directed a lot of Warner Bros. coming-of-age films that are fun but dated, but here he's in his intelligent element again. See this and be amazed at the truths it tells. And Genvieve Page..a marvel as always. The last 20 minutes..unbelievable.",5,A Great film!,1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,1214,"['better', 'film', 'critics', 'reviewed.James', 'Franciscus', 'excellent', 'here', 'scenes', 'Genvieve', 'Page', 'explode', 'wih', 'sexual', 'chemistry', 'acting', 'good', 'reason', 'own', 'film', 'see', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'late', 'film', 'wonderfiully', 'showing', 'how', 'act', 'screen.Suzanne', 'Pleshette', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'big', 'oles', 'film', 'wjhy..she', 'Angie', 'Dickenson', 'were', 'given', 'little', 'work', 'here', 'Suzanne', 'Pleshette', 'works', 'delivers', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'close', 'high', 'water', 'mark', 'rival', 'Genvieve', 'Page.The', 'co-stars', 'are', 'superb', 'continually', 'give', 'sense', 'decadence', 'publishing', 'world', 'usual', 'compromises', 'also', 'too', 'hatreds', 'fester', 'reek', 'havoc', 'Fransiscus', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'new', 'novelist', 'sort', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'famous', 'for..uncovering', 'evil', 'making', 'adultry', 'not', 'big', 'deal', '1964', 'films', 'cause', 'death', 'chaos', 'varieties', 'film.Delmar', 'directed', 'lot', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'coming-of-age', 'films', 'are', 'fun', 'dated', 'here', 'intelligent', 'element', 'again', 'See', 'be', 'amazed', 'truths', 'Genvieve', 'Page..a', 'marvel', 'always', 'last', '20', 'minutes..unbelievable']",Youngblood Hawke

1511077,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B0066E6VV6,William Timothy Lukeman,"[4, 5]","Yes, ""trashier"" -- a failure to go completely over the top makes this film at best moderately enjoyable, rather than gloriously entertaining in the way only a full-blown Hollywood melodrama can be. Filming in B&W; was a mistake, as this sort of story absolutely needs that wonderfully oversaturated Technicholor of the late 1950s, making everything look both larger than life & waxily artificial. It feels as if the film doesn't quite know which way it wants to go: a gritty portrait of a dog-eat-dog social world, or a shameless wallow in shallow excess. Because, let's face it, the latter is what makes this sort of movie so much fun!Still, there's good work to recommend here. James Franciscus isn't afraid to make his character a hard-edged, self-involved cad, perhaps not quite as naive as everyone else around him seems to think. He knows what he wants (or thinks he does) & goes after it relentlessly. And you can't go wrong with a dependable character actor like Edward Andrews, who brings a smarmy, slimy joie de vivre to his role as an acerbic literary critic; this sort of role is a speciality of his that's always a bright spot. Suzanne Pleshette has a somewhat more thankless role as the long-suffering good girl, but she still manages to give it an added sexiness without any effort.I'll admit to having a certain soft spot in my heart (or head) for this film, which I saw as a young boy in the 1960s. Seeing it with an adult's eyes decades later forces me to admit that it's probably more of a rental for many prospective viewers. Recommended for those who like melodrama, but with some reservations.",3,"Enjoyable, but should have been better (i.e., trashier) - 3 & 1/2 stars",1349222400,"10 3, 2012",2012,1615,"['Yes', 'trashier', 'failure', 'go', 'completely', 'top', 'film', 'best', 'moderately', 'enjoyable', 'rather', 'gloriously', 'entertaining', 'way', 'only', 'full-blown', 'Hollywood', 'melodrama', 'can', 'be', 'Filming', 'B', 'W', 'was', 'mistake', 'sort', 'story', 'absolutely', 'wonderfully', 'oversaturated', 'Technicholor', 'late', '1950s', 'making', 'everything', 'look', 'larger', 'life', 'waxily', 'artificial', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'way', 'go', 'gritty', 'portrait', 'dog-eat-dog', 'social', 'world', 'shameless', 'wallow', 'shallow', 'excess', 'let', 'face', 'latter', 'what', 'sort', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'Still', 'good', 'work', 'recommend', 'here', 'James', 'Franciscus', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'make', 'character', 'hard-edged', 'self-involved', 'cad', 'perhaps', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'naive', 'everyone', 'else', 'think', 'what', 'relentlessly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'dependable', 'character', 'actor', 'Edward', 'Andrews', 'who', 'smarmy', 'slimy', 'joie', 'de', 'vivre', 'role', 'acerbic', 'literary', 'critic', 'sort', 'role', 'speciality', 'always', 'bright', 'spot', 'Suzanne', 'Pleshette', 'somewhat', 'more', 'thankless', 'role', 'long-suffering', 'good', 'girl', 'still', 'give', 'added', 'sexiness', 'effort.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'having', 'certain', 'soft', 'spot', 'heart', 'head', 'film', 'saw', 'young', 'boy', '1960s', 'Seeing', 'adult', 'eyes', 'decades', 'later', 'forces', 'admit', 'probably', 'more', 'rental', 'many', 'prospective', 'viewers', 'Recommended', 'who', 'like', 'melodrama', 'reservations']",Youngblood Hawke
