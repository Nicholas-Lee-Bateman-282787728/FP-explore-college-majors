1067921,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B000P0J0GK,Enjolras,"[10, 12]","I just finished reading Shaun Ellis'The Man Who Lives with Wolves, so it was nice to watchA Man Among Wolvesand actually see these wolves. Ellis seems to have great insight into wolves. He emphasizes the importance of pack hierarchy and ""rough play"" to the development of wolves. It think it's important to be clear - Ellis doesn't think the wolves are tricked into thinking he's a wolf. Rather, he is trying to mimic the behavior of wolves to 1) understand their psychology better, and 2) train orphaned/captive wolves as close as possible to a natural wolf parent in order for eventual reintroduction into the wild (as opposed to letting them become glorified dogs in zoos). As such, Ellis tries to simulate an actual pack lifestyle as close as is possible. The wolves seem to accept him to a remarkable degree and follow his lead.Some reviewers have compared Shaun Ellis' to Timothy Treadwell ofGrizzly Manfame. I'm not sure that comparison hold. Treadwell had certain emotional and psychological problems, as is evident from his rantings in the filmGrizzly Man. Ellis displays a pretty cool head and knows what he's doing. He might be nuts to live with wolves, but he's not crazy. Do I wish Shaun Ellis went on to get a Ph.D. and followed scientific methodology in his research? Yes, but that's not my choice to make. In the meantime, he is making interesting observations.If you liked this documentary, you'll appreciate Shaun Ellis' new bookThe Man Who Lives with Wolves. He goes into detail about his background and observations on wolf behavior. It's also a lot more nuanced than this documentary.",4,Be the Wolf,1269475200,"03 25, 2010",2010,1605,"['just', 'finished', 'reading', 'Shaun', ""Ellis'The"", 'Man', 'Who', 'Wolves', 'was', 'nice', 'watchA', 'Man', 'Wolvesand', 'actually', 'see', 'wolves', 'Ellis', 'have', 'great', 'insight', 'wolves', 'importance', 'pack', 'hierarchy', 'rough', 'play', 'development', 'wolves', 'think', 'important', 'be', 'clear', 'Ellis', ""n't"", 'think', 'wolves', 'are', 'tricked', 'thinking', 'wolf', 'Rather', 'trying', 'mimic', 'behavior', 'wolves', '1', 'understand', 'psychology', 'better', '2', 'train', 'orphaned/captive', 'wolves', 'as', 'close', 'possible', 'natural', 'wolf', 'parent', 'order', 'eventual', 'reintroduction', 'wild', 'opposed', 'letting', 'become', 'glorified', 'dogs', 'zoos', 'such', 'Ellis', 'simulate', 'actual', 'pack', 'lifestyle', 'as', 'close', 'possible', 'wolves', 'seem', 'accept', 'remarkable', 'degree', 'follow', 'lead.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'compared', 'Shaun', 'Ellis', 'Timothy', 'Treadwell', 'ofGrizzly', 'Manfame', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'comparison', 'hold', 'Treadwell', 'had', 'certain', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'problems', 'evident', 'rantings', 'filmGrizzly', 'Man', 'Ellis', 'pretty', 'cool', 'head', 'what', 'doing', 'might', 'be', 'nuts', 'live', 'wolves', 'not', 'crazy', 'Do', 'wish', 'Shaun', 'Ellis', 'went', 'get', 'Ph.D.', 'followed', 'scientific', 'methodology', 'research', 'Yes', 'not', 'choice', 'make', 'meantime', 'making', 'interesting', 'observations.If', 'liked', 'documentary', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'Shaun', 'Ellis', 'new', 'bookThe', 'Man', 'Who', 'Wolves', 'detail', 'background', 'observations', 'wolf', 'behavior', 'also', 'lot', 'more', 'nuanced', 'documentary']",N/A
