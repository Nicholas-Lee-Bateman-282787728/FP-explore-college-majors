125229,A1A87TUBBDPMF0,0792133153,"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer""","[50, 51]","(I wrote this for the original, out of stock version)Clear and Present Danger (1994 film)The third film in the Jack Ryan series (and the last one to star Harrison Ford) deals with America's war on drugs and also the abuse of power in high places.  As in Clancy's original novel, the plot hinges on one crucial question: how far can a President go to achieve a laudable goal, even if the means cross moral, legal and international boundaries?As in the novel of the same name, the interception of an American-flagged yacht in the Caribbean results in the arrest of two Colombian ""sicarios"" (hit men) who have murdered the American owner (along with his entire family).  The resulting FBI-CIA investigation reveals that Peter Hardin, the late yacht owner and personal friend of the U.S. President (Donald Moffat), had extensive ties to the Cali drug cartel.  Hardin, as Jack Ryan (Ford) explains, had been skimming millions from his ""partners,"" thus sealing his fate.Although Ryan is aware that the President is understandably upset that his late friend was a money launderer for the drug lords, he is not aware that the National Security Advisor, Admiral James Cutter (Harris Yulin) and his CIA colleague Bob Ritter (Henry Czerny) have been given off-the-record orders to do ""something about the drugs pouring into the country.""  When the President declares to Cutter that the drug cartels pose a ""clear and present danger"" to the United States, the somewhat slimy admiral and Ritter unleash several covert operations within the sovereign nation of Colombia.While Ryan does get orders to go to Bogot&aacute; and find out about Hardin's financial dealings with the Cali Cartel,  he is totally unaware that Cutter and Ritter have launched Operation Reciprocity, a clandestine invasion of Colombia by Spanish-speaking special-ops troops.  These forces, supervised by ex-CIA field officer John Clark (Willem Dafoe), wreak havoc as they blow up drug labs and smuggling aircraft.  Nevertheless, Cutter and Ritter keep Ryan in the dark, and the upright analyst and now acting Deputy Director (Intelligence) unknowingly tells a Senate subcommittee that there are no troop deployments planned for Colombia.Further complicating Ryan's life is the sudden discovery that his boss and mentor, Admiral James Greer (James Earl Jones), is dying of cancer.  Little does he know that his ascent to Greer's job will propel Ryan into the middle of a life and death situation in Colombia...and a constitutional crisis at home.What makes the Jack Ryan books and movies work is not just the slam-bam action sequences or the glimpses at the mysterious workings of the CIA, but the very notion that a CIA employee can be portrayed as an honorable and decent fellow.  Tom Clancy clearly desired to show that the agents and analysts who work for the CIA are not the ""dark forces"" depicted in films such as ""Three Days of the Condor"" or ""Firefox.""  Nor are they martini-swilling, trigger happy, bed-hopping super-spies like James Bond.  Ford (like Alec Baldwin before him, and like Ben Affleck after) shows Ryan has intelligence, courage, and, above all, integrity.As in Patriot Games, Ford also shares a few short yet important scenes with his wife and two children.  Ann Archer and Thora Birch returned to play Ryan's wife Cathy and daughter Sally, giving Ryan that most un-Bond-like sense of family and a tie to the audience.Although the screenplay by Donald Stewart, Steven Zaillan, and John (Red Dawn) Millius strip the huge and complex Clancy novel to its bare essentials and changes many scenes and situations, Ford's acting and Philip Noyce's able directing makes Clear and Present Danger a top-notch action thriller.  Even though as in Patriot Games the ending is rendered in a good-guy vs. bad-guy shootout (whereas in the novel the ending for the villains was more subtle and thereby more chilling), this movie is still worth watching.The DVD I own is Paramount's first barebones release.  Of course, even that is an improvement over the pan-and-scan ""full screen"" VHS tape I had previously owned.  The movie has been restored to its original Widescreen presentation, given Dolby digital audio in both English and French, Spanish subtitles, English captions, interactive menus, and the theatrical trailer.  The newer version has commentary tracks, making-of featurettes, and other extras.",5,Revenge is a dangerous motive......,1057104000,"07 2, 2003",2003,4369,"['wrote', 'original', 'stock', 'version', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', '1994', 'film', 'third', 'film', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'series', 'last', 'one', 'star', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'deals', 'America', 'war', 'drugs', 'also', 'abuse', 'power', 'high', 'places', 'Clancy', 'original', 'novel', 'plot', 'one', 'crucial', 'question', 'how', 'far', 'can', 'President', 'go', 'achieve', 'laudable', 'goal', 'even', 'means', 'cross', 'moral', 'legal', 'international', 'boundaries', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'interception', 'American-flagged', 'yacht', 'Caribbean', 'results', 'arrest', 'two', 'Colombian', 'sicarios', 'hit', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'murdered', 'American', 'owner', 'entire', 'family', 'resulting', 'FBI-CIA', 'investigation', 'reveals', 'Peter', 'Hardin', 'late', 'yacht', 'owner', 'personal', 'friend', 'U.S.', 'President', 'Donald', 'Moffat', 'had', 'extensive', 'ties', 'Cali', 'drug', 'cartel', 'Hardin', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Ford', 'had', 'been', 'skimming', 'millions', 'partners', 'thus', 'sealing', 'fate.Although', 'Ryan', 'aware', 'President', 'understandably', 'upset', 'late', 'friend', 'was', 'money', 'launderer', 'drug', 'lords', 'not', 'aware', 'National', 'Security', 'Advisor', 'Admiral', 'James', 'Cutter', 'Harris', 'Yulin', 'CIA', 'colleague', 'Bob', 'Ritter', 'Henry', 'Czerny', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'off-the-record', 'orders', 'do', 'something', 'drugs', 'pouring', 'country', 'When', 'President', 'Cutter', 'drug', 'cartels', 'pose', 'clear', 'present', 'danger', 'United', 'States', 'somewhat', 'slimy', 'admiral', 'Ritter', 'unleash', 'several', 'covert', 'operations', 'sovereign', 'nation', 'Colombia.While', 'Ryan', 'get', 'orders', 'go', 'Bogot', 'aacute', 'find', 'out', 'Hardin', 'financial', 'dealings', 'Cali', 'Cartel', 'totally', 'unaware', 'Cutter', 'Ritter', 'have', 'launched', 'Operation', 'Reciprocity', 'clandestine', 'invasion', 'Colombia', 'Spanish-speaking', 'special-ops', 'troops', 'forces', 'supervised', 'ex-CIA', 'field', 'officer', 'John', 'Clark', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'blow', 'up', 'drug', 'labs', 'smuggling', 'aircraft', 'Nevertheless', 'Cutter', 'Ritter', 'keep', 'Ryan', 'dark', 'upright', 'analyst', 'now', 'acting', 'Deputy', 'Director', 'Intelligence', 'unknowingly', 'Senate', 'subcommittee', 'are', 'troop', 'deployments', 'planned', 'Colombia.Further', 'complicating', 'Ryan', 'life', 'sudden', 'discovery', 'boss', 'mentor', 'Admiral', 'James', 'Greer', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'dying', 'cancer', 'Little', 'know', 'ascent', 'Greer', 'job', 'will', 'propel', 'Ryan', 'middle', 'life', 'death', 'situation', 'Colombia', 'constitutional', 'crisis', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'books', 'movies', 'work', 'not', 'just', 'slam-bam', 'action', 'sequences', 'glimpses', 'mysterious', 'workings', 'CIA', 'very', 'notion', 'CIA', 'employee', 'can', 'be', 'portrayed', 'honorable', 'decent', 'fellow', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'clearly', 'desired', 'show', 'agents', 'analysts', 'who', 'work', 'CIA', 'are', 'not', 'dark', 'forces', 'depicted', 'films', 'such', 'Three', 'Days', 'Condor', 'Firefox', 'are', 'martini-swilling', 'trigger', 'happy', 'bed-hopping', 'super-spies', 'James', 'Bond', 'Ford', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Ryan', 'intelligence', 'courage', 'integrity.As', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'Ford', 'also', 'shares', 'few', 'short', 'yet', 'important', 'scenes', 'wife', 'two', 'children', 'Ann', 'Archer', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'returned', 'play', 'Ryan', 'wife', 'Cathy', 'daughter', 'Sally', 'giving', 'Ryan', 'most', 'un-Bond-like', 'sense', 'family', 'tie', 'screenplay', 'Donald', 'Stewart', 'Steven', 'Zaillan', 'John', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'Millius', 'huge', 'complex', 'Clancy', 'novel', 'bare', 'essentials', 'changes', 'many', 'scenes', 'situations', 'Ford', 'acting', 'Philip', 'Noyce', 'able', 'directing', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'top-notch', 'action', 'thriller', 'Even', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'ending', 'rendered', 'good-guy', 'vs.', 'bad-guy', 'shootout', 'whereas', 'novel', 'ending', 'villains', 'was', 'more', 'subtle', 'thereby', 'more', 'chilling', 'movie', 'still', 'worth', 'watching.The', 'DVD', 'own', 'Paramount', 'first', 'barebones', 'release', 'course', 'even', 'improvement', 'pan-and-scan', 'full', 'screen', 'VHS', 'tape', 'had', 'previously', 'owned', 'movie', 'been', 'restored', 'original', 'Widescreen', 'presentation', 'given', 'Dolby', 'digital', 'audio', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'English', 'captions', 'interactive', 'menus', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'newer', 'version', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'making-of', 'featurettes', 'other', 'extras']",N/A

I can't believe how dated the movie is almost 20 years later. Today we are more concerned with terrorists than we are with drug dealers. Although aren't they usually one and the same?I have not read the Jack Ryan books but I will say this: the movies are top knotch. I've seen them all, save for the Ben Affleck movie. Clear & Present Danger is the best of all of the ones I've seen and I can tell you I was on the edge of my seat watching this movie! it was written, produced and directed with remarkable precision while the pace engrossed me from beginning to end.I loved the casting of Miguel Sandoval as the head of Cali Cartel. He even looked a bit like the late Pablo Escobar of the now defunct Medillin Cartel. All of these situations are believable, and I must say theat Ford's portrayal of a CIA man was as real life as one can get. Although I must agree with Clancy that Ford was a bit old for the role at the time. Still, no one else in Hollywood could have matched his performance at that time.My one major quibble was how Cortez was killed in the end of the movie. There is no was a sniper could fire a rifle at a moving target (Albeit Slowly) from a moving (And Ascending) helo! Killing off Cortez was politically correct, but it was unrealistic. It cost the movie a Star and in my opinion should have been edited. It would have been more realistic for Cortez to have survived, thereby seeing his captives escape and his opportunity for controling the cartel (And His Life) more tenuous than ever. That in itself would have made a sequel more than worth paying for. Too bad the producers did not go that route.In response to Alex-Diaz Granados's fantastic Five-Star review, I will say again that while the CIA should not be completely demonized, they also should not be lionized. They are at best amoral people, people who do what they do for their own reasons. While most are not ""evil,"" they have a tendancy to skirt rules and regulations to the point where they feel they can do whatever they want in poorer countries in the world. Would the United States allow the KGB or any other intelligence agency to dictate or manipulate its affairs? The answer is no. Why then should Colombia or Ethiopia or any other poor nation be subject to US black ops intervention?I look forward to seeing this on DVD at some point and will read the book when I have the time.A.

I was really excited to see this movie because Red October was so good.  When it was over, I thought, hmm, this was good, but Red October was better in so many ways.  First of all, the plot is a little complex, but I was still able to follow it.  Second of all, I've read Rainbow Six, another Clancy novel which has John Clark and Ding Chavez instead of Jack Ryan.  Clark and Chavez are both in this movie, but they are nothing like their written counterparts.  In Rainbow Six, Clark is a CIA strategic genius chosen to head an international antiterrorist agency.  I haven't read Clear and Present Danger, but in the movie, he is portrayed as a cowboy, and a rogue.  Chavez in the book is loyal to Clark and would die for him.  In the movie, he almost kills him for something that wasn't his fault.  Anyway, back to Clear and Present Danger.  Harrison Ford is very, very good as Jack Ryan, but I preffered Alec Baldwin, because Ryan is just an analyst, and Baldwin fits that description better than Ford.  In this movie, Ford does get into a lot of battles, and in Red October, the only time Baldwin ever touches a gun is at the very end.  James Earl Jones is back as Admiral Greer, and he does a good job again, and finally, Willem Dafoe is a great actor, though I don't think that the role of John Clark is right for him if they followed the book.  I guess they changed Clark's personality because Dafoe played him.  This is a good movie, but I strongly reccomend Red October, and I will review Patriot Games as soon as I see it.",3,"Better Than Many Films, But Not The Best",1021161600,"05 12, 2002",2002,1689,"['seeing', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'seeing', 'previews', 'Sum', 'All', 'Fears', 'wanted', 'see', 'other', 'two', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'movies', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'see', 'movie', 'Red', 'October', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'When', 'was', 'thought', 'hmm', 'was', 'good', 'Red', 'October', 'was', 'better', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'First', 'all', 'plot', 'little', 'complex', 'was', 'still', 'able', 'follow', 'Second', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Rainbow', 'Six', 'Clancy', 'novel', 'John', 'Clark', 'Ding', 'Chavez', 'instead', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Clark', 'Chavez', 'are', 'movie', 'are', 'nothing', 'written', 'counterparts', 'Rainbow', 'Six', 'Clark', 'CIA', 'strategic', 'genius', 'chosen', 'head', 'international', 'antiterrorist', 'agency', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'cowboy', 'rogue', 'Chavez', 'book', 'loyal', 'Clark', 'would', 'die', 'movie', 'almost', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', 'Anyway', 'back', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'preffered', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Ryan', 'just', 'analyst', 'Baldwin', 'description', 'better', 'Ford', 'movie', 'Ford', 'get', 'lot', 'battles', 'Red', 'October', 'only', 'time', 'Baldwin', 'ever', 'gun', 'very', 'end', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'back', 'Admiral', 'Greer', 'good', 'job', 'again', 'finally', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'great', 'actor', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'role', 'John', 'Clark', 'right', 'followed', 'book', 'guess', 'changed', 'Clark', 'personality', 'Dafoe', 'played', 'good', 'movie', 'strongly', 'reccomend', 'Red', 'October', 'will', 'review', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'as', 'soon', 'see']",N/A

125237,A87V31JZUV0HK,0792133153,ARealGenius,"[5, 9]","I preface all of my DVD reviews with the following note: There are more than enough film reviews on Amazon.com and, quite frankly, it's a bit ridiculous. A person can scroll through scores/pages of reviews without reading a single sentence about the quality of the DVD. If you want to review or discuss a film, go to IMDB. If you're reviewing the DVD, speak to the qualities (or lack thereof) of the audio and video; mention your opinions of the plot, acting, etc. but please don't write an essay!Now, on to my review of the Clear and Present Danger DVD.VIDEO (A+): I watch my DVDs on a 34"" CRT (tube) HDTV, which makes a big difference in terms of image quality. There is no technology currently on the market which surpasses CRT in terms of color, contrast, detail, and especially true black levels. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either uninformed or straight-out lying. Of course, the trade off is that CRTs are limited to a smaller screen size, but it's a compromise I'm more than willing to make. I say that to say this: people who complain about the Clear and Present Danger DVD having less-than-stellar colors, detail, or black levels must not be watching on a widescreen CRT. This DVD looks absolutely beautiful throughout; unless it is remastered years from now for Blu-Ray or HD-DVD, this is as good as the film is going to look. I've seen this movie on cable numerous times over the years, but seeing it in all its anamorphic glory was like a revelation.AUDIO (A): A DTS track is available, but I stick with DD 5.1. It sounds almost as good as it looks. Dialogue and music are clear and well-mixed, neither intruding on or interfering with the other. Effects are nicely done, but this mix lacks a slight bit of punch compared to other action movies.FILM (A+): This movie is highly regarded, and rightly so.

What I am pleasantly surprised is the increased amount of intelligence over Patriot Games to make Clear and Present Danger a thinking man's film. And that's why I keep revisiting this film often. Harrison Ford is such an entertaining actor, and when he plays Jack Ryan, I could tell that he is loving his work while he makes a great character of himself. The most memorable character of Clear and Present Danger has to be Miguel Sandoval who plays Ernesto Escobar. Speaking of villains, there was not one or two or three but many of them from the good side and the bad side. That's why the movie is so interesting in different ways. Out of the President of the United States, Ernesto Escobar, James Ritter, and Felix Cortez, who is the ultimate badass guy? That's a good question. I love it the most when Henry Czerny goes, ""Boom."" I could play that scene over and over and still not get bored. I realize now the first time ever that I notice an incredulous revelation when I was watching Clear and Present Danger. When the President of the United States appears, I said to myself, ""Yeah, that's James Cromwell."" Then I looked the ending credits but turned out to be, ""Donald Moffat."" I was like, ""What? Well, maybe he used a pseudonym."" Lo and behold, no...there are two different actors who happen to look almost identically the same. That's quite amazing. I guess my perspective of movies has changed a lot now after that. Another thing that I am impressed with Clear and Present Danger is the lines; there are many great quotes coming from the movie such as, ""The old Two-Step Potomac,"" ""I don't dance,"" ""Do you play tennis?"" ""How dare you come in here and lecture me!,"" ""How dare you, sir?"" ""Jack, computer theft is a serious crime,"" ""You are such a boy scout,"" and ""The course of action I'd suggest is a course of action I can't suggest."" I love the cast once again: Harrison Ford, Anne Archer, James Earl Jones, Willem Dafoe, Donald Moffat, Joaquim de Almeida, Harris Yulin, Miguel Sandoval, and the great Henry Czerny. All in all, Clear and Present Danger is the best movie of the Jack Ryan series, narrowly edging out The Hunt for Red October and Patriot Games. I am raising the rating for Clear and Present Danger from `8' to `10'.",5,Easily One of My Favorites.

First of all, Jack Ryan is a whole lot more lovable than Ollie North, especially when played by Harrison Ford. I've had a bad case of the hots for Harrison Ford since the original Star Wars. Come to think of it, James Earl Jones was in that one, too . . . though not as Ford's boss, as in this case.OK, for those two or three people who have not read the story: James Earl Jones plays Admiral Greer, deputy director of the CIA and Jack Ryan's boss. Jack is an analyst who keeps getting treated like a covert op, mostly due to circumstances. But now Greer gets sick and has asked Ryan to take over his spot. Just the right time for a potentially messy scandal to erupt, right? The Coast Guard picks up a boat which was apparently known to be involved in the cocaine trade and finds that several people were killed aboard it. Problem is, these people were President Bennett's (Donald Moffat) good friend since school days and his family.Investigating the Good Old Boy and his relationship to the drug trade, we discover that he has some $650 million stashed away in various banks and real estate holdings around the world. The president assumes it is our money (i.e., the federal government's), Ernesto Escobedo, the Columbian drug lord who had him killed, figures it's his money. That is, money Good Old Boy stole from him.If you love fast action movies with lots of things that blow up, you'll enjoy this one. If you love stories about corrupt politicians and the crooked things they do, you'll love it. If you just enjoy seeing attractive, athletically fit men push themselves to the limit, you'll love Harrison Ford and the rest of the attractive, athletically fit men in this one. My favorite in that regard is Willem Dafoe as ""Clark,"" a mercenary hired by various American interests to clean up the mess, first one way and then another. I must not tell you what he does, to whom, or in whose pay without ruining the story.

Here the erstwhile Jack Ryan is thrust into the hot seat as his long-time mentor Admiral James Greer (played By James Earl Jones) is forced by health into taking sick leave and Ryan (Harrison Ford) is tapped to take his place as the Acting Deputy Director for Counter Intelligence (DCI) within the CIA. As such he is sucked into the somewhat murky effort to investigate the circumstances surrounding the grisly murder of a millionaire businessman who was a personal friend of the current President.Ryan quickly discovers a Columbian drug connection, with one of the biggest and most dangerous cartels, and further traces what appears to be a money laundering operation that the dead entrepreneur was investing in legitimate businesses in the United States. Informed of this, the President quit publicly impounds the funds, and initiates a spiral of events that eventually spin way out of control. Thus, once again the game is afoot. Ryan must tread softly but quickly to counter the deft moves made by another CIA deputy director who is blindsiding the Agency while serving the President's National Security Advisor.The game gets hotter and hotter, with so much action and so much suspense building up that it is impossible not to appreciate and enjoy. The is a wonderful film, one that will stir your patriotic juices as the same time it raises your pulse rooting for Ryan to right the grievous wrongs perpetrated on some American special forces troopers who are intentionally stranded in-country to fend for themselves as they find themselves caught in the middle of the quickly changing political and strategic circumstances. Harrison Ford is terrific as Jack Ryan, reprising his takeover of it in ""Patriot Games"".Also superb (as usual) is Willem Defoe playing John ""Jack"" Clark, our man on the ground in Columbia, and relative newcomer Joaquim de Almeida as the deadly head of security for the Escobedia family cartel. Miguel Sandoval is convincingly menacing as the cartel's front man Ernesto Escobedia. Of course, the photography and special effects are masterful and heighten the degree of suspense and realism of the quickly transpiring action sequences. I. This is a spy-thriller of the first magnitude, one I have watched again and again for it is such eye-candy and so exciting that I find myself caught up in it each time I sit down to enjoy it.

So, after you finish reading my wonderful  and informative review, go to the &quot;Book&quot; section, then buy this  book, because it's actually worth your time.I suppose the reason why I'm  so disappointed by this movie is (much like &quot;Starship Troopers,&quot;)  I thought so highly of the book that the movie would almost have to be a  let-down.My problem with the film version of this book can be summed up  thusly: Hollywood's Bob Ritter is a disloyal, Beltway-political sleaze who  cuts off the commandos simply because it's easier than fighting for them.  Clancy's Bob Ritter holds loyalty as the highest virtue. He made his name  in the CIA by going against orders behind the Iron Curtain to effect the  escape of one of his agents whose cover had been blown.I also feel  compelled to correct some other erronious statements made by another  reviewer.

Greer (James Earl Jones) is hospitalized with aggressive pancreatic cancer and asks his old friend Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) to take over his slot at the CIA, he sums up the process of survival in Washington in four words: ""Watch your back, Jack.""  The Admiral may not have realized how very true this would be.  A lifelong friend of President Bennett's (Donald Moffat), with his wife and two children, has been murdered and his yacht hijacked by two enforcers working for a Colombian drug lord (Miguel Sandoval).  Angry, Bennett allows two of his staff members (Henry Czerny, Harris Yulin), by way of an ex-spy named John Clark (William Dafoe), to initiate a clandestine military operation against the kingpin's facilities, which escalates into a mass murder when several of the Colombians hold a meet.  What no one expected was that the trusted right-hand man (Joaquim de Almeida) of the original target has ambitions of his own.  And when Jack discovers the truth, he finds his life and his career on the line.This is the third Jack Ryan movie, and while perhaps not the best, it's still a real showcase for Ford, whose character displays all the integrity we associate with those played by classic actors like Henry Fonda and Jimmy Stewart (when the President warns him that blowing the whistle will only mean *he* will take the fall, he doesn't let it stop him from doing what he believes is right), plus his own tough, gritty courage, which sends him all the way to Colombia in search of the truth.  There's also plenty of suspense and the usual great special effects, and families watching it should have a starting point for some good discussions about things like honesty and just how far it's possible to go in pursuit of one's goals.",4,"The ""drug war"" becomes a real war",1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,1754,"['When', 'Adm.', 'Greer', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'hospitalized', 'aggressive', 'pancreatic', 'cancer', 'old', 'friend', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'take', 'over', 'slot', 'CIA', 'sums', 'up', 'process', 'survival', 'Washington', 'four', 'words', 'Watch', 'back', 'Jack', 'Admiral', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'realized', 'how', 'very', 'true', 'would', 'be', 'lifelong', 'friend', 'President', 'Bennett', 'Donald', 'Moffat', 'wife', 'two', 'children', 'been', 'murdered', 'yacht', 'hijacked', 'two', 'enforcers', 'working', 'Colombian', 'drug', 'lord', 'Miguel', 'Sandoval', 'Angry', 'Bennett', 'two', 'staff', 'members', 'Henry', 'Czerny', 'Harris', 'Yulin', 'way', 'ex-spy', 'named', 'John', 'Clark', 'William', 'Dafoe', 'initiate', 'clandestine', 'military', 'operation', 'kingpin', 'facilities', 'mass', 'murder', 'when', 'several', 'Colombians', 'hold', 'meet', 'What', 'one', 'expected', 'was', 'trusted', 'right-hand', 'man', 'Joaquim', 'de', 'Almeida', 'original', 'target', 'ambitions', 'own', 'when', 'Jack', 'truth', 'life', 'career', 'line.This', 'third', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'not', 'best', 'still', 'real', 'showcase', 'Ford', 'character', 'integrity', 'associate', 'played', 'classic', 'actors', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'when', 'President', 'blowing', 'whistle', 'will', 'only', 'mean', '*he*', 'will', 'take', 'fall', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'own', 'tough', 'gritty', 'courage', 'way', 'Colombia', 'search', 'truth', 'also', 'plenty', 'suspense', 'usual', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'families', 'watching', 'should', 'have', 'starting', 'point', 'good', 'discussions', 'things', 'honesty', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'possible', 'go', 'pursuit', 'one', 'goals']",N/A

The country is &#34;in danger&#34; (ahem; &#34;clear and present&#34;) which is really just a catch-phrase to excuse military intervention into a  foreign nation's affairs. In this case the POTUS is personally affronted by the death of a personal friend and deems the killers to be &#34;a clear and present danger&#34; and so unofficially authorizes covert action against the killers from Columbia: a highly unlikely possibility at the time this movie was made, but in current times (2014) I am not so sure. What makes this movie stand out from the crowd is that Jack Ryan (Ford) an agent temporarily working in a high level position in the CIA is simultaneously doing an investigation of the incident which led to the death of the friend of the POTUS while the act of retribution is being carried out  behind his back. Of course, eventually he becomes aware of the entire plot, but not before it has been carried out. There are many consequences that unfold from the covert action, but &#34;Jack Ryan&#34; eventually ends up turning in the President and all his cronies to the Senate oversight committee because he is a loyal and trustworthy kind of guy. Yeah, right. Okay, that is the plot in a nutshell, and if you can overlook the unlikely nature of all of the events (other than the killing of the POTUS's friend), then you will enjoy the action of this aging flick.

125262,ALNRJZMNHMJD7,0792133153,Curt Remmel,"[0, 1]","This is a completely different film to its predecessor, Patriot Games - not necessarily better or worse, but its tone and direction are much more different, and its use of Ryan certainly is. We see far more of James Earl Jones' character Greer in this movie, and that is a good thing: he is a strong figure, a mentor and a sounding-board for Ryan, and watching his decline and death brings both counterpoint and perspective to the other on-screen events. The other supporting cast don't serve a single-minded purpose as they did in Patriot Games, rather they interact more, engage in political manouvreing, and indulge in self-serving machination. Ryan tries to weave his way through all this, choosing the path he believes is right, often with great doubt and a lack of confidence. This is not Patriot Games, where the goals and the target were clear and distinct, and where the cast either attacked or defended you - this is a far more politically unstable movie.  Corruption is an underlying theme in this movie. It is not necessary big-money corruption, merely the act of cover-up, subterfuge and failure to follow due process. The president wants vengance against Colombian drug lords so orders covert military operations, against the express wishes of Congress, while bit-players in the CIA and NSC manouvre to protect themselves if and when it all goes bad. When it does, they surrender the troops in a fit of deal-making and cover-up, while the key drug lord himself has been double-crossed. Ryan, in the guise of intelligence expert rather than fighter (though he sees his share of that) puts all the pieces together and goes to any extent to do what is right: firstly to rescue the troops from Colombia, and then to expose the stench of presidential and bureacratic corruption. Can you guess if he is successful?  The stand-out scene is when Ryan returns and confronts the President in the Oval Office, bunting away his offers and then his threats. Ford's acting in this scene is terrific: he conveys frustration, sadness and raw fury, barely restrained by respect for the office, as he squares off against the most powerful man in the world. But in the end he leaves with his dignity intact, which is the underlying moral of the story: that doing the right thing is ultimately dignifying.

125264,AE12AEJFCOGGY,0792133153,"David Montgomery ""Book Critic""","[4, 8]","In the world of books, Tom Clancy is the undisputed king of the techno-thriller.  In the world of the movies, though, his title is a little less secure.  ""The Hunt for Red October"" was a very taut and exciting film.  ""Patriot Games"" was rather ordinary with only occasional glimpses of  Clancy's magic.  This third entry in the series is somewhere in  between.Harrison Ford is back as CIA analyst-extraordinaire Jack Ryan,  only this time he's been promoted to acting Deputy Director of  Intelligence.  With his new job, though, comes new responsibility and  accountability, something he finds that he is not altogether happy  with.The clear and present danger referred to in the title is the threat  posed by the powerful and violent drug lords of the Colombian cartels.  After the cartels kill a close friend of the President's, he decides that  something must be done.  Unfortunately, he does not have the legal  authority to implement the course of action that he desires.  If you think  that is going to stop him, though, you are in for a surprise.In a review  of this sort, there is always a temptation to reveal more of the plot than  one should.  I will resist, however, and not give anything else away.  Let  it suffice to say that the story is interesting, reasonably complex and  enjoyable, even if the ultimate outcome is never in doubt.Harrison Ford  is the kind of actor who is always fun to watch, even when he doesn't have  much to work with.  Here, though, writer John Milius and his collaborators  have given Ford a good, well-written role and he makes the most of it.  The  Ryan character hasn't developed much since the last film, but that is  forgivable.  The emphasis in these pictures is always on the plot and the  characters are made to serve it, rather than the other way around.Ryan  is joined this time by the mysterious Mr. Clark, a mercenary and former  Company man.  Clark is well-played by Willem Dafoe, an actor who doesn't  get to work as much as I would like.  It is too bad because he is very  good.  Clark will no doubt be spun-off into a sequel of his own, as Clancy  himself has done with the later books.  Clark is a good character with a  lot of potential and I am eager to see what is in store for him next.My  main complaint with this film is a common one: it is too darn long.

Ford as Ryan is subbing for the Director (Jones)and becomes involved in a conspiracy which implicates some higher up.  His discovery and the actions that follow make for an intriguing thriller. It's a little slow at first with some exposition but the final moments are gripping particularly the scene between Ryan and the President (Moffat) which is very well acted by both actors.

When his mentor (James Earl Jones) falls ill due to pancreatic cancer, Ford is suddenly put in charge as deputy director of the CIA.  He continues his investigation of the murders and ties them in with one particular drug cartel leader (Miguel Sandoval) with whom the murdered man had a little issue with ill-gotten money,....But what Ford doesn't know is that, on orders from the revenge-minded Moffatt, his second deputy (Henry Czerny) and the president's national security advisor (Harris Yulin) have ordered a rogue officer named Clark (Willem Dafoe) in with a covert military team to put a huge dent in the cartel's activities.  Dafoe and his team are successful at what they do, but the cartels retaliate with deadly results on Ford's friends in the FBI during a visit to Bogota.  And when Ford finds out about the operation, he finds himself going down to Colombia a second time to help spirit Dafoe and the covert team out of harm's way.Ably directed, once more, by Phillip Noyce (DEAD CALM; PATRIOT GAMES), CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER gives Ford another chance to prove his mettle in the action genre.  The suspense and CIA intrigue are all laid out exceptionally well by Noyce and his first-rate cadre of screenwriters, Donald Stewart, Steven Zaillian, and John Milius.  Jones is at his usual best as the now-dying Admiral Greer, and Anne Archer returns as Ford's wife.But a performance really worth noting here is Czerny's as the unconsciously corrupt CIA deputy director Robert Ritter.  About as uncouth and conniving a heavy as there has ever been in the movies, his performance is absolutely chilling and believable.  It makes the whole notion of our government going beyong reasonable bounds even more credible than it already is.Some will object to the film not pandering to Clancy's right-wing political points of view or his gung-ho pro-military stance, but that isn't necessarily what this movie is about.  It does not condemn covert military action, but it does question the wisdom of sending men into a war zone where the risks are extreme, the reasons for such actions are vague at best, and there is no clear exit strategy.  Such points are made extremely well in this film's action format; and for those reasons, it gets the highest marks.",5,"Ryan, The Drug Cartels, And CIA Abuse",1042070400,"01 9, 2003",2003,2654,"['third', 'installment', 'cinematic', 'series', 'based', 'Tom', 'Clancy', 'CIA', 'analyst', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'CLEAR', 'AND', 'PRESENT', 'DANGER', 'long', 'engrossing', 'political', 'action', 'thriller', 'once', 'again', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'thinking', 'man', 'action', 'film', 'actor', 'role', 'Ryan.This', 'time', 'around', 'Ford', 'murder', 'close', 'friend', 'President', 'Donald', 'Moffatt', 'Colombian', 'drug', 'cartel', 'hitmen', 'When', 'mentor', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'ill', 'due', 'pancreatic', 'cancer', 'Ford', 'suddenly', 'put', 'charge', 'deputy', 'director', 'CIA', 'investigation', 'murders', 'ties', 'one', 'particular', 'drug', 'cartel', 'leader', 'Miguel', 'Sandoval', 'whom', 'murdered', 'man', 'had', 'little', 'issue', 'ill-gotten', 'money', 'what', 'Ford', ""n't"", 'know', 'orders', 'revenge-minded', 'Moffatt', 'second', 'deputy', 'Henry', 'Czerny', 'president', 'national', 'security', 'advisor', 'Harris', 'Yulin', 'have', 'ordered', 'rogue', 'officer', 'named', 'Clark', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'covert', 'military', 'team', 'put', 'huge', 'dent', 'cartel', 'activities', 'Dafoe', 'team', 'are', 'successful', 'what', 'do', 'cartels', 'retaliate', 'deadly', 'results', 'Ford', 'friends', 'FBI', 'visit', 'Bogota', 'when', 'Ford', 'out', 'operation', 'going', 'down', 'Colombia', 'second', 'time', 'help', 'spirit', 'Dafoe', 'covert', 'team', 'harm', 'way.Ably', 'directed', 'once', 'more', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'DEAD', 'CALM', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'CLEAR', 'AND', 'PRESENT', 'DANGER', 'Ford', 'chance', 'prove', 'mettle', 'action', 'genre', 'suspense', 'CIA', 'intrigue', 'are', 'laid', 'out', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'Noyce', 'first-rate', 'cadre', 'screenwriters', 'Donald', 'Stewart', 'Steven', 'Zaillian', 'John', 'Milius', 'Jones', 'usual', 'best', 'now-dying', 'Admiral', 'Greer', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'Ford', 'wife.But', 'performance', 'really', 'worth', 'noting', 'here', 'Czerny', 'unconsciously', 'corrupt', 'CIA', 'deputy', 'director', 'Robert', 'Ritter', 'uncouth', 'conniving', 'heavy', 'ever', 'been', 'movies', 'performance', 'absolutely', 'chilling', 'believable', 'whole', 'notion', 'government', 'going', 'reasonable', 'bounds', 'even', 'more', 'credible', 'already', 'is.Some', 'will', 'object', 'film', 'not', 'pandering', 'Clancy', 'right-wing', 'political', 'points', 'view', 'gung-ho', 'pro-military', 'stance', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'not', 'condemn', 'covert', 'military', 'action', 'question', 'wisdom', 'sending', 'men', 'war', 'zone', 'where', 'risks', 'are', 'extreme', 'reasons', 'such', 'actions', 'are', 'vague', 'best', 'clear', 'exit', 'strategy', 'Such', 'points', 'are', 'made', 'extremely', 'well', 'film', 'action', 'format', 'reasons', 'highest', 'marks']",N/A

To this end, Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan becomes caught up in the action along with the always-great Willem DaFoe as CIA agent Clark.  Just about all of the actors in this movie are great, including Joaquim de Almeida, Donald Moffat, Henry Czerny (the slime dripping off his character might damage your TV), and Raymond Cruz.Not only is this one of my favorite spy/government intrigue movies, but it's just flat-out one of my favorite movies.

125302,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0792133153,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 1]","At first it looks like a banal drug film with some CIA agents trying to find out who killed a couple of people and why, people who were personal friends of the President of the US. Just that makes things tricky, I mean the fact that the victims were friends of the President of the US. Be discreet Jack. But things are also trickier than they look and I don't want to tell you the film. I am just going to give a few ideas about politics first. A politician always lies, by definition and by principle. It sounds pessimistic and it is. Never believe a politician, no matter what side he is on and what side you are on. A politician will always do what the circumstances will make him do under pressure. If he is wise he will listen to his advisers and he will think then. If he is not wise he will run into the wall and push with his head. He may break through, but anyway afterwards he will tell you tall tales. The second element is that you have to serve politicians, no matter what and just try to cover your back and by back I mean under your lower back. You can serve them well it does not matter. If there is a problem you will be the fuse. If the problem was big, you may be the fuse, but the politicians will get it on their heads. But that will not give you what you deserve: a medal and a premium for serving them well. The film brings up another line of reflection. Politicians do not give a damn about the life of the people who are defending the country or who are fighting just or unjust wars for their country. Politicians consider these fighters as pawns on their chessboard and if they die they are collateral victims of their own game. Too bad for them they were those who had to die. If they died with honor they might get some coverage and recognition, otherwise they might get buried under a pile of rocks in some jungle. Their families will be handed a casket full of stones. But beyond these fighters in uniform do not believe civilians are in any way considered in this matter. Civilians are not even collateral damage. They are just collateral garbage. And unluckily that's the fundamental point here. Who cares about children,  women, and plain civilians. They should not have been here in the first place. Good riddance, next time they will not be dumb enough to be present on a future mass crime scene. That's how you get out of that film. And the last scene will not change anything. There is no justice in such a situation. You may see the politician who exploited you fall because his arrogance brings him down, but that will not be justice for you who will have footed the bill of that liar. So make up your mind and just accept to be used, over-used and abused by politicians: that's their fundamental function and you are a sucker by definition since you are not in politics.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",5,"If you don't believe them, you're right",1287792000,"10 23, 2010",2010,2944,"['first', 'banal', 'drug', 'film', 'CIA', 'agents', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'killed', 'couple', 'people', 'why', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'personal', 'friends', 'President', 'US', 'Just', 'things', 'tricky', 'mean', 'fact', 'victims', 'were', 'friends', 'President', 'US', 'Be', 'discreet', 'Jack', 'things', 'are', 'also', 'trickier', 'look', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'tell', 'film', 'am', 'just', 'going', 'give', 'few', 'ideas', 'politics', 'first', 'politician', 'always', 'definition', 'principle', 'pessimistic', 'Never', 'believe', 'politician', 'matter', 'what', 'side', 'what', 'side', 'are', 'politician', 'will', 'always', 'do', 'what', 'circumstances', 'will', 'make', 'do', 'pressure', 'wise', 'will', 'listen', 'advisers', 'will', 'think', 'then', 'not', 'wise', 'will', 'run', 'wall', 'push', 'head', 'may', 'break', 'anyway', 'will', 'tell', 'tall', 'tales', 'second', 'element', 'have', 'serve', 'politicians', 'matter', 'what', 'just', 'try', 'cover', 'back', 'back', 'mean', 'lower', 'back', 'can', 'serve', 'well', 'not', 'matter', 'problem', 'will', 'be', 'fuse', 'problem', 'was', 'big', 'may', 'be', 'fuse', 'politicians', 'will', 'get', 'heads', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'what', 'deserve', 'medal', 'premium', 'serving', 'well', 'film', 'up', 'line', 'reflection', 'Politicians', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'damn', 'life', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'defending', 'country', 'who', 'are', 'fighting', 'just', 'unjust', 'wars', 'country', 'Politicians', 'consider', 'fighters', 'pawns', 'chessboard', 'die', 'are', 'collateral', 'victims', 'own', 'game', 'Too', 'bad', 'were', 'who', 'had', 'die', 'died', 'honor', 'might', 'get', 'coverage', 'recognition', 'otherwise', 'might', 'get', 'buried', 'pile', 'rocks', 'jungle', 'families', 'will', 'be', 'handed', 'casket', 'full', 'stones', 'fighters', 'uniform', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'civilians', 'are', 'way', 'considered', 'matter', 'Civilians', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'collateral', 'damage', 'are', 'just', 'collateral', 'garbage', 'unluckily', 'fundamental', 'point', 'here', 'Who', 'children', 'women', 'plain', 'civilians', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'here', 'first', 'place', 'Good', 'riddance', 'next', 'time', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'dumb', 'enough', 'be', 'present', 'future', 'mass', 'crime', 'scene', 'how', 'get', 'film', 'last', 'scene', 'will', 'not', 'change', 'anything', 'justice', 'such', 'situation', 'may', 'see', 'politician', 'who', 'exploited', 'fall', 'arrogance', 'down', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'justice', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'footed', 'bill', 'liar', 'So', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'just', 'accept', 'be', 'used', 'over-used', 'abused', 'politicians', 'fundamental', 'function', 'are', 'sucker', 'definition', 'are', 'not', 'politics.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",N/A

Ford assures Congress that no ground troops are to be introduced; yet that's exactly what happens when 2 CIA rivals secretly overtrump Ford, without his knowlege. After almost being killed on a fact finding mission, Ford returns first to Washington to get the story straight,then back to Colombia to help rescue as many covert soldiers as possible. Returning to the White  House, the president insists that Ford""take the fall"" for the administration.

Perhaps I hold this film in such high regard because of that (I can never forgive them for altering the climax of Hunt for Red October.)Harrison's second outing as Jack Ryan is definitely better than his first.  While Patriot Games was a straight action thriller, Clear and Present Danger combines suspenseful action sequences with genuine political intrigue.  Jack Ryan is sent after a Colombian drug lord at the same time that his superiors at the CIA have sent special forces into Colombia to do the dirty deed themselves.  This is a complex film that will satisfy both the action crowd and those who want a &quot;thinking man's movie.&quot;Some people have complained about the film's length.  I'm angry that it wasn't long enough.  A Clancy novel is so far-reaching that a three hour film is needed to capture its scope.  The  movie going public is generally too impatient to sit that long, and a lot of good material ends up getting cut.Willem Dafoe and James Earl Jones also give strong performances as John Clark and Admiral Greer.  Harrison Ford makes a great Jack Ryan despite his age.  I'm disappointed that he turned down the upcoming (watered down) adaptation of &quot;The Sum of All Fears.&quot;  I was holding out hope that he would return for a movie based on &quot;Executive Orders,&quot; but Sept. 11th killed all chances that book had of going to the big screen.Even if you have never read Tom Clancy, watch Clear and Present Danger.

Thanks you all, for summarizing the storyline.Erik North's (a top 1000 reviewer) review is pretty comprehensive in naming the actors, directors, etc. but he left out Benjamin Bratt (of Law & Order and Julia Roberts' Boy Toy fame) as the captain of the insertion team, and Raymondo Cruz as Ding.The novel by the same name had Ding as the central character, and I was sorry that Ding had only a supporting role in the movie. However, the movie is GREAT entertainment in its own right.Raymondo Cruz's Ding was sophisticated and touching. I especially liked his restrained satisfied expression after being selected for a mission that would let him name his own ticket afterwards.Miguel Sandoval's performance as the ruthless drug lord, but loving family man, was nothing short of WONDERFUL. I especially liked his seamless transition from Spanish to English. Did you know that the production actually blew up that villa in which the drug lords were having a summit? Yes, they below up that nice house for for a few seconds worth of entertainment.And why no mention of Joachim de Alameda, whose performance as the villain should have boosted his career, but didn't seem to have? His tortured expression just before killing his lover portrayed a depth of character that is a real bonus! The woman who played his lover was perfectly cast and wardrobed: spinster who is delighted and at the same time, frightened by her affair. The way Alameda phrased his lines with a credible Spanish accent was very nuanced -- a great performance.The interleaving of formal, military funeral rites with the massacre of the insertion team was masterful -- only music and visuals, no dialog. The allusion to formal military honors also being conferred on the soldiers who were mowed down anonymously in the jungle was inspired. Such a cinematic device is more powerful than any narration or mind-numbing 'kill 'em all' sequence can deliver. Compliments to the film editor.The integrated humor mark a new trend in action movies. Ryan asked his boozey helicopter pilot who was checking the manual and instrumentation of a newly purchasd craft ""How much time do you have in this type?"" The reply, after consulting his watch, was ""9:30.""Donald Moffat's performance as the President could have greater dimension, and it overtly mimmicked Reagan, but that portrayal counters somewhat Clancy's accused conservative bias. A nod toward Hollywood liberalism? The whole movie, while upholding the courage and honor of American armed forces, rivals Oliver Stone in accusing the executive branch, from the president down, of corruption and betrayal. So even Lefties would find something to like about this movie.The movie's opening sequence promises excellent action with compelling characters: the Coast Guard intercepts a hijacked private yacht and the teen-aged-looking and sounding FEMALE Coast Guard captain was commanding, and was obeyed! This movie engages the viewer on many levels: intellectual, political, visual, human, humorous and does it all entertainingly.

125341,A2VGKGXSG81KAS,0792133153,Michael J. Berquist,"[1, 2]","Of the three Tom Clancy novels made into films, &quot;Danger&quot; impresses almost as much as 1990's &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;. Based on one of the best of Clancy's novels, &quot;Clear and Present  Danger&quot; is a complex story. In a nutshell- the President is furious  when his best friend and family are murdered by drug dealers, so he enlists  his National Security Advisor and the head of Operations at the CIA to run  an illegal covert operation (including the insertion of troops) designed to  strike at the Cali Cartel's operations. (Shades of Iran-Contra . . .)  Naturally things go wrong (the FBI director is assassinated in retaliation,  which kicks off a retaliatory bombing from a US fighter-bomber that kills  almost the entire cartel), and Jack Ryan finds out. Does Ryan cover his  butt in the time-honored Washington tradition? Or does he do the right  thing, rescue the troops and report the President's misconduct to Congress?  Gee, what do you think?I liked Ford's turn as Ryan this time around- he  brings a different dimension to the character that works well here. Ryan's  a good man who does the right thing- others wouldn't. (The author of this  review is baffled as to why &quot;law &amp; order&quot; conservatives were  so quick to excuse the behavior of a felon like Ollie North.) I also liked  Willem Dafoe's performance as John Clark (in the novels- a darker version  of Clancy's hero Ryan). The rest of the cast shines- the director did a  superb job recruiting actors who make the most of their scenes and the  action sequences are exciting- more so than in &quot;Patriot  Games&quot;.This is a very good movie. Better than &quot;Red  October&quot;? I don't know about that, but &quot;Danger&quot; gives it a  run for its money.

When Paramount DVD first issued ""Clear and Present Danger"" the transfer quality was...well...gosh darn awful.  In fact it had to rank up there with the worst transfers I had ever seen.  Now we get the new and improved, second ""special"" edition of this cloak and dagger thriller.Based on the novel by Tom Clancy, Harrison Ford is Jack Ryan, a professor and retired CIA agent who gets thrown back into the hopper when he accidentally becomes involved in a terrorist plot to assassinate one of England's Royals.  The plot has heavily dated.  It centers around a drug cartel and CIA agent, Jack Ryan's mission to infiltrate and stop the spread of massive drug trading into the U.S.  Yeah - right!This latest transfer from Paramount Home Entertainment really isn't as much of an improvement as one would have hoped for.  Almost gone are the excessive aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement, abundantly present on the original DVD - but not entirely.  Pixelization still plagues many of the outdoor scenes and long shots.  But of more concern is the color balancing.  At times flesh tones appear too pink or orange.  Fine details are completely lost in the dark scenes while they occasionally appear digitally harsh during some of the day scenes.  Overall the color scheme is muted, dull and muddy with a bland characteristic.  Several scenes are also plagued by an opaque haze that weakens black and contrast levels. Film grain, nicks, chips and scratches are blatantly apparent throughout and, while they don't distract, they really don't add anything to the viewing experience either.  The audio is presented in both 5.1 and DTS.  Both versions are almost identical with the DTS bumping up the bass levels a notch.  Still, at times voices seem to be centered too directly into the center speaker with little to no ambiance spread across the other channels.  Some effects and screams crackle the sound field and are strident and grating on the ear.EXTRAS: We get a comprehensive documentary that covers all the bases and a theatrical trailer.

The facts treated in this film are information everybody should know, it affects us all; governments have been using drugs to control the masses since the Chinese Opium wars. The movie was made in 1994, by then Michael Ruppert, a former LAPD narcotics officer, had posted his videos in You Tube about the CIA flooding East LA with Heroine and other stupefacients in, perhaps, a Malthusian effort to decimate the Black and Hispanic ghettos. About 30, 35 years ago, High Times magazine published an article stating the CIA had commissioned an aircraft carrier (I've forgotten its name) to haul Heroine into the US. Mr. Noyce, the director of the film, could've easily mentioned or hinted these morsels of information to come up with a more powerful and meaningful film; however, producers and Hollywood itself, sometimes, interfere with topics that are apt to take offense, or slightly provoke politicians. During the Russian invasion of Afghanistan the CIA created al-Qaeda, a US asset ever since, to defeat the Russians by turning young conscripts into Heroine addicts; the Soviets lost the war but gained a lot of junkies. The Afghan poppy flower fields, the Colombian and Mexican drug cartels are run by international banks and cabals-much of this information is found on a variety of web sites.The film remains a great favorite of audiences, the mechanics of the conspiracies, the drug lord modus of operandi, their planning and ways of distribution is accurate, and most important, it touches and area in which most cineaste would prefer to leave alone to make films of another gender.

125370,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,0792133153,Robert Morris,"[18, 22]","This is one of two films based on Clancy's novels which really work, the other being The Hunt for Red October. It is certainly far superior to Patriot Games in terms of plausibility and cohesion of narrative, quality of acting, exploration of central issues, and ultimate resolution of various conflicts. I do think the escape by helicopter from one drug lord's compound was overdone but the film concludes appropriately with Ryan's final conversation with President Bennett (Donald Moffatt) and then his arrival at the subcommittee hearing chaired by Senator Mayo (Hope Lange). I still would have preferred that Alec Baldwin continue as Jack Ryan but concede that Harrison Ford is far more credible in this film than he was in Patriot Games, perhaps because he and his colleagues were working with a much better screenplay, one on which John Milius collaborated with Donald E. Stewart and Steve Zaillian. (It should be noted that Stewart and Zaillian also collaborated on the screenplay and must share at least some of the blame for Patriot Games' inadequacies. Both films were also directed by Phillip Noyce, another accomplice.) Having the President of the United States actively involved in Danger's narrative gives it a unique substance, to be sure, but also affords valuable opportunities to explore moral corruption and political expediency at the highest levels of government.There are several outstanding performances, including Moffatt's in a difficult role as is Henry Czerny's as Robert Ritter, deputy director of the C.I.A. and Ryan's principal adversary; also Willem Dafoe as Clark and Harris Yulin as Cutter. Anne Archer reprises her do-nothing-but-beam role as Cathy Ryan, adoring wife; James Earl Jones also reprises his role as Admiral James Greer whose health problems deny Ryan his mentor and friend's assistance when needed most. This is a ""techno-thriller"" in several respects but its special effects are almost never gratuitous. An important sub plot involves Moira Wolfson (Ann Magnuson) who is the F.B.I. director's administrative assistant and a key source of classified information which she provides to Felix Cortes (brilliantly played by Joaquim DeAlmeida) whom she believes to be a reputable businessman, not knowing that he is a key operative for one of the Colombian drug lords. Wolfson loves Cortes to death, literally.Lots of well-staged action, including an ambush of the F.B.I. director and his entourage, another ambush of American troops in the jungle (a callous and bloody betrayal by their government), a missile attack on the drug lords and their families, and the final helicopter escape by Ryan and Clark. As in The Hunt for Red October, the story line sustains the film's momentum, aided by generally solid performances. I do not consider this film an indictment of any specific administration or foreign policy. Clancy is primarily a storyteller, not a polemicist. The United States will continue to have clear and present dangers no matter who is in the White House.

Harrison Ford really has the Jack Ryan character down pat, and turns in his customary excellent performance.  As always, James Earl Jones plays his part, as the CIA director, to perfection.The storyline here is far more complex than the two earlier Jack Ryan films, which caused me to worry that the film would either sacrifice important elements of the novel, or become so convoluted that most viewers would have difficulty following the story.  Neither occurs--the movie tells a complicated political/adventure story in a crisp and coherent fashion that retains the viewer's interest.  This is a very fine film.The basic premise is simple enough--the President decides to insert US forces into Columbia to take out certain elements of the drug cartels operating there.  This is done without any permission/authorization from Congress and is therefore illegal.  As might be expected, not everything goes according to plan. And of course Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) has to straighten things out.  Therein lies a fast-paced and interesting story that parallels in some ways the conflict between Congress and President Reagan in the 1980s as regards the Nicaraguan Sandinistas and the Contras.The DVD is excellent, with very good color and sound.  Fans of Ford, Tom Clancy, or simply those who like fast-paced political action thrillers will want to include this DVD in their collections.",4,An excellent political thriller.

When it was written, America had just abandoned the CONTRA freedom fighters by cutting off funding. The U.S. Government left men behind in Korea and Vietnam, so the depiction of a small Special Forces (SF) team being abandoned to their own devices is possible; its already happened during time of war. The point of the book/movie is to get public outrage over this so when our men become &quot;shadow warriors&quot; that in return for their loss of identity that the secret government keeps faith with them and sees to it that they return home. This is the rousing conclusion at the film's end when Ryan testifies before Congress demanding more oversight over special operations.The greatness of this film is that Jack Ryan's character IS willing to put it all on the line to rescue them in a thrilling climax. Before we get to this point, we see how a small unit of SF operators with a context of jungle cover/concealment (contrast this with McNab's Bravo Two-Zero's desert environment) can do a tremendous amount of damage with hand weapons and explosives. The need for a communications &quot;lifeline&quot; is paramount and how seemingly mundane places like a hotel room can be the nerve center for a field operation. The depiction of SF terminal guidance of a laser-guided munition is instructive. When the SF team is surrounded by superior numbers of inferior quality men, the result is still negative and provides a warning---reaction forces must be ready to pull men out of enemy areas and the new Air-Mech-Strike concept (See David Grange's book by the same name) offers a way to storm into such areas using tracked armored vehicles and extract the men then later on fly out by aircraft rather than trying to insert/extract them from rooftops just by vulnerable, unarmored helicopters (Blackhawk Down!).The RPG ambush of the rubber-tired armor bodied SUVs (Somalia, 1993) when the VIP is assassinated is also instructive as wheeled vehicles simply cannot be armored to the level that a tracked vehicle can be. The need for better VIP weaponry to include smokescreens, and fire supremacy-gaining heavy machine guns to defeat the urban ambush mitigates against the denial and non-chalance complacency so common because these would seem &quot;too war like&quot;. The issue of OPSEC is covered well when the Secretary who is seduced by the drug lord operative gives away a piece of information that results in the VIP being targeted and killed.The musical score of this film is rousing and a triumph, I hope its available at Amazon.com.",5,BEST depiction of a small-unit Direct Action mission,969753600,"09 24, 2000",2000,2667,"['Clearly', 'Clancy', 'most', 'realistic', 'book/film', 'was', 'taken', 'current', 'events', 'merged', 'fictional', 'story', 'When', 'was', 'written', 'America', 'had', 'just', 'abandoned', 'CONTRA', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'cutting', 'off', 'funding', 'U.S.', 'Government', 'left', 'men', 'Korea', 'Vietnam', 'depiction', 'small', 'Special', 'Forces', 'SF', 'team', 'being', 'abandoned', 'own', 'devices', 'possible', 'already', 'happened', 'time', 'war', 'point', 'book/movie', 'get', 'public', 'outrage', 'so', 'when', 'men', 'become', 'quot', 'shadow', 'warriors', 'quot', 'return', 'loss', 'identity', 'secret', 'government', 'keeps', 'faith', 'return', 'home', 'rousing', 'conclusion', 'film', 'end', 'when', 'Ryan', 'testifies', 'Congress', 'demanding', 'more', 'oversight', 'special', 'operations.The', 'greatness', 'film', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'character', 'willing', 'put', 'line', 'rescue', 'thrilling', 'climax', 'get', 'point', 'see', 'how', 'small', 'unit', 'SF', 'operators', 'context', 'jungle', 'cover/concealment', 'contrast', 'McNab', 'Bravo', 'Two-Zero', 'desert', 'environment', 'can', 'do', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'damage', 'hand', 'weapons', 'explosives', 'need', 'communications', 'quot', 'quot', 'paramount', 'how', 'seemingly', 'mundane', 'places', 'hotel', 'room', 'can', 'be', 'nerve', 'center', 'field', 'operation', 'depiction', 'SF', 'terminal', 'guidance', 'laser-guided', 'munition', 'instructive', 'When', 'SF', 'team', 'surrounded', 'superior', 'numbers', 'inferior', 'quality', 'men', 'result', 'still', 'negative', 'warning', '-reaction', 'forces', 'must', 'be', 'ready', 'pull', 'men', 'enemy', 'areas', 'new', 'Air-Mech-Strike', 'concept', 'See', 'David', 'Grange', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'way', 'storm', 'such', 'areas', 'using', 'tracked', 'armored', 'vehicles', 'extract', 'men', 'then', 'later', 'fly', 'out', 'aircraft', 'rather', 'trying', 'insert/extract', 'rooftops', 'just', 'vulnerable', 'unarmored', 'helicopters', 'Blackhawk', 'Down', '.The', 'RPG', 'ambush', 'rubber-tired', 'armor', 'bodied', 'SUVs', 'Somalia', '1993', 'when', 'VIP', 'assassinated', 'also', 'instructive', 'wheeled', 'vehicles', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'armored', 'level', 'tracked', 'vehicle', 'can', 'be', 'need', 'better', 'VIP', 'weaponry', 'include', 'smokescreens', 'fire', 'supremacy-gaining', 'heavy', 'machine', 'guns', 'defeat', 'urban', 'ambush', 'mitigates', 'denial', 'non-chalance', 'complacency', 'so', 'common', 'would', 'seem', 'quot', 'too', 'war', 'quot', 'issue', 'OPSEC', 'covered', 'well', 'when', 'Secretary', 'who', 'seduced', 'drug', 'lord', 'operative', 'away', 'piece', 'information', 'results', 'VIP', 'being', 'targeted', 'killed.The', 'musical', 'score', 'film', 'rousing', 'triumph', 'hope', 'available', 'Amazon.com']",N/A

The video displays a true life coloration with great detailing in the shadows as well as  the lighter areas.  There was a warm color grading but it was not overly rich as one often sees, especially when the action takes place in hot climates.  Compression Mbps rates appeared to be mostly in the low 30's which contributes to a clearly improved video image.  At no time did I see any artifacting or ghosting and the film played without a hiccup.  For a film made in 1994, you will see a fine filmic grain but it only slightly softens the image without taking away from it.  The storyline certainly holds up and the film retains its legs.The audio is Dolby Digital True HD lossless audio and the sonic editors also did a fine job with realistic panning across both the front and rear sound stages and between the two stages.  There was a goodly amount of discreet steering  of foley effects to the various channels when appropriate and your LFE channel will get a workout in many places.  For me, lossless audio makes a huge and audible difference as opposed to lossy audio.Not found on the Standard Def DVD was a 30 minute doc with interviews with much of the excellent cast and director that I found quite interesting.  They also talked and showed off the animated storyboard that was very uncommon back then.To be honest, I did not expect either the audio or video to be as good as it was and strongly recommend the film and its upgrade to blu ray.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, and that I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",5,Clear and Present Danger on Blu Ray,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,1917,"['do', 'have', 'Standard', 'Def', 'version', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'comparison', 'two', 'just', 'review', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'summary', 'plot', 'opinions', 'acting', 'book', 'whatever.I', 'gave', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'transfer', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'video', 'true', 'life', 'coloration', 'great', 'detailing', 'shadows', 'as', 'well', 'lighter', 'areas', 'was', 'warm', 'color', 'grading', 'was', 'not', 'overly', 'rich', 'one', 'often', 'especially', 'when', 'action', 'place', 'hot', 'climates', 'Compression', 'Mbps', 'rates', 'appeared', 'be', 'mostly', 'low', '30', 'clearly', 'improved', 'video', 'image', 'time', 'did', 'see', 'artifacting', 'ghosting', 'film', 'played', 'hiccup', 'film', 'made', '1994', 'will', 'see', 'fine', 'filmic', 'grain', 'only', 'slightly', 'image', 'taking', 'away', 'storyline', 'certainly', 'film', 'legs.The', 'audio', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'True', 'HD', 'lossless', 'audio', 'sonic', 'editors', 'also', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'realistic', 'panning', 'front', 'rear', 'sound', 'stages', 'two', 'stages', 'was', 'goodly', 'amount', 'discreet', 'steering', 'foley', 'effects', 'various', 'channels', 'when', 'appropriate', 'LFE', 'channel', 'will', 'get', 'workout', 'many', 'places', 'lossless', 'audio', 'huge', 'audible', 'difference', 'opposed', 'lossy', 'audio.Not', 'found', 'Standard', 'Def', 'DVD', 'was', '30', 'minute', 'doc', 'interviews', 'much', 'excellent', 'cast', 'director', 'found', 'quite', 'interesting', 'also', 'talked', 'showed', 'animated', 'storyboard', 'was', 'very', 'uncommon', 'back', 'then.To', 'be', 'honest', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'audio', 'video', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'film', 'upgrade', 'blu', 'ray.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A

125390,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,0792133153,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[2, 2]","Whether or not you're a fan of Tom Clancy novels, the plots can sure make for some great entertainment. While some of the Jack Ryan stories have had very mixed results as movies (I really did not like Alex Baldwin or Ben Affleck as the protagonist), Harrison Ford has been uniformly awesome in the role. It's just someone he was born to play if you ask me. In fact, I wish he was in every film in the series (that would have been fantastic). At any rate, Harrison Ford is fantastic in this movie, and he's surrounded by a great cast, in what has got to be my absolutely favorite modern political film (wouldn't quite call it a thriller).The story (as I have been told, because I've never read a Clancy novel) was greatly truncated from the book, yet still manages to tell a great story. And the story is simple. The President of the United States faces a possible scandal involving someone he knew turning up dead after crossing some dirty business partners, and as this person was a friend of his, decides to carry out his own little secret war against the drug cartel in Columbia since they've become such a thorn in his side. Harrison Ford as Ryan is a honest and straight-shooting yet lovable guy who finds himself advising the President and investigating the cartels.The whole story is really shown from four different perspectives. The hero protagonist is of course Ryan, and we follow him as he carries out his investigation. There is also the other government agents who are involved in the secret war and advise the president and conspire against Ryan.Then we have one of the drug lords who finds himself being attacked by the US government, and largely just gets angry and tries to figure out why everyone seems to be getting more and more ticked at him. Lastly we have the mysterious invisible man who manipulates everyone behind the scenes and spies on everyone, the REAL villain of the story in many ways.The drama is fantastic as several stories unfold at once, Ryan's boss (played by James Earl Jones) slowly dies of cancer, a mercenary (Willem Dafoe) commands the secret operations team including one particularly sharp shooter, and Ryan gets closer and closer to finding out the truth about everything.If action is your thing this movie has enough of that, with one sequence in particular being a standout. The invisible man sends assassins to take out Ryan and the people with him, and it's a supremely thrilling few minutes while rocket launchers take one one vehicle after another and Ryan tries to escape with his life and protect his friend. If you have a good sound system that sequence is a showcase. A very nice sound mix throughout this film, and the musical score by James Horner is also beautiful. The visuals are quite good also and the entire movie is very well shot, much like The Fugitive (none of that shaky hand-held garbage here!)The dialog in this movie is great, and the end of the film has a very satisfying climax as Ryan finds out the truth, faces down the beaurocrats who lied to him, and leads a mission to save the troops who have been abandoned by the leaders of the country.This film can be taken different ways, but to me it is a bold statement about integrity and nobility. In the entire movie Ryan never uses a gun even once, and he's the hero. His crusade is all about doing the right thing and believing in that, even when he discovers that he's the own one left who clings to such ideals. I'm not sure many actors could pull off such a performance and have such conviction, but Ford does a wonderful job portraying Ryan as the last good man in a country gone corrupt. It's really great stuff, and when you combine it with all the political intrigue and detective work of figuring out who is who and what is what in the investigation Ryan conducts, and the action between the troops and the Cartels, this is one great piece of entertainment with a strong message about doing what you know is right and honoring those who make sacrifices to do the same.

This movie, simply put, has nearly nothing to do with it. Sure, the general plot is 'sort of' there, but it's more like they borrowed the theme of the book than the book itself. You might want to see it for the sake of Harrison Ford, who does a great job playing Jack Ryan. It also does have a good deal of carnage and some exciting points, and even with the watered-down plot, there's no way to make a Clancy story completely dull.
