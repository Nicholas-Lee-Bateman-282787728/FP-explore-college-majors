But then again, to call this movie BAD would be the opposite of an exaggeration. To call this movie an insult to humanity would be an understatement. To say that Grown Ups 2 was a mind-numbingly stupid, unfunny, idiotic, unredeemable crapfest would only cover it by about 34.2 percent. To say that Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, and David Spade have not one ounce of comedy material left in their bones, however, is sadly true.Let me be clear on one thing: Grown Ups 2 is NOT. FUNNY. It's NOT. GOOD, either. It's not funny if you like smart humour. It's not funny if you like dumb humour. It's not funny if you want to relax with your family, watch a stupid movie, watch a gross movie, or even watch a bad movie. It will come up short on EVERY. LEVEL. Trust it from the poor audiences who were duped into losing two hours of their life that could have been spent less painfully using a ballpoint pen to gouge out their own eyes.To actually think back to the time I watched this (or at least until I walked out), causes my brain cells to have post-traumatic stress. But I soldier on for the good of the populace - to save them from a fate like mine.

It is the type of humor you would have found in the ""Airplane"" and ""Police Academy"" movies.  It is over the top, it can be cheesy, sometimes the jokes miss their mark by a few miles but still you find yourself amused and laughing as the situations unfold whether it is David Spade's character being rolled down a hill in a monster truck tire or Shaquille O'Neal's character throwing a guy over a house.  Not that Shaq couldn't actually do that!I am not sure if they set some kind of a record, but the cast listing for this movie is HUGE with a lot of celebrities making cameo appearances, feel free to check out the IMDB page to see the 200 or so cast members listed.  Seeing Victoria's Secret Angel Erin Heatherton dressed up as a cheerleader in the car wash scene was worth the price of admission if you ask me!  Of course Dan Patrick, as a gym teacher with short shorts, climbing the rope in gym class may give you nightmares.  You have been warned.This is not a movie where you're going to get a big plot or character development.  What you will get is some laughs, some more sophomoric than others.

1581573,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B0090SI53C,FNDNreview,"[5, 12]","So, Adam Sandler has never made a sequel?  How is that possible?  If you really think about it, that interesting tidbit makes perfect sense.  What would be the point of making 50 First Dates 2, The Wedding Singer 2, Just Go with It 2, or Happy Gilmore 2 (even though that would have been a massively successful sequel)?  It doesn't appear that Sandler has purposely avoided making a sequel, he's just one of those ""one and done"" actors that never reprises his previous roles, despite heavily criticism for many of them (although, it's hard to imagine criticism keeps him up at night).  It's no secret critics have been pretty harsh on the ""King of the Razzie.""  The response to the majority of his films has been pretty sub-par over recent years (okay, that was being nice - it has really been downright terrible).  Regardless, Sandler has very few box office bombs under his belt over the course of his lengthy career, and those that did end up in the red were easily replenished by his successful flicks, including Grown Ups, which raked in an impressive $271 million in 2010.  And, with that being said - it's no surprise the stars of Grown Ups are back for a sequel, cleverly titled, Grown Ups 2.Directed by Dennis Dugan (Grown Ups, Happy Gilmore, Just Go with It), Grown Ups 2 stars Adam Sandler who reprises his role as Lenny Feder, a Hollywood talent agent.  After living the Hollywood lifestyle, Lenny moved his family back to his suburban roots, once again living near his best friends - Eric (Kevin James), Kurt (Chris Rock), and Marcus (David Spade).  For their kids, it's the last day of school before summer is out, and for the adults, it's just another day in the neighborhood.  But, why not start the summer off right - with a party?  However, before the party can begin, Lenny, along with his friends and family, have plenty to do - like attend a dance recital, reminisce about some childhood memories, and face-off against a bunch of chest-bumping frat guys.  Salma Hayek, Steve Buscemi, Taylor Lauter, and Shaquille O'Neal also star in supporting roles.There's no need to dance around the major issue of this film:  there's absolutely no point to it whatsoever.  From beginning to end, this film is quite simply a reason for Adam Sandler to get all of his friends together to make a cheesy movie and get paid to do it.  Sure, some people will criticize the fact that this film is lazy and lacks ambition, but at the same time, most Adam Sandler flicks are full of pointless nonsense.  It would be too easy to tear this film apart, pointing out its endless amount of flaws, but so many comedies out there these days lack purpose, often sacrificing plot for cheap laughs - and that's exactly the point.  Even though this film, much like its predecessor, leaves a great deal to be desired in the plot department (not to mention character development), the film still features a great deal of entertainment value.  If you don't' believe me, just ask yourself the simple question:  If Adam Sandler movies are so bad, why do so many moviegoers continue to pay to see them?  The simple answer is they're funny...and Grown Ups 2 is no exception.Once again, the main cast is back - including Kevin James, Chris Rock, and David Spade.  Their shenanigans are endless and the childish pranks continue on from the first film, spending plenty of time passing gas, wiping off deer pee (yeah, you read that right), and ribbing each other's shortcomings.  Some scenes are funnier than others, with one of the best being an uninflated river raft incident, and the stalest being the opening scene where a deer invades the Feder household.  Still, the laughs will be pretty consistent throughout.  Oddly enough, the majority of the ""funniest"" moments involve Shaquille O'Neal, who portrays a laid-back police officer.  And, if you're a fan of previous Adam Sandler flicks, then you'll recognize the majority of the supporting cast/cameos, which includes Allen Covert, Steve Buscemi, Jon Vovitz, Peter Dante, Dan Patrick, and Nick Sardson.  Missing from the film, however, is Rob Schneider - one of the main cast members from the first film.  Citing another filming obligation as the reason for his absence, Nick Sardson fills in as a new character, even though his character clearly was written for Schneider, which often resembles Schneider's characteristics from Grown Ups.In the event that you're on the fence about seeing Grown Ups 2, there's a simple rule of thumb:  if you enjoyed Grown Ups, there's no reason to assume you won't enjoy this sequel.  The film features a quality cast, a ton of laughs, and the content is kept relatively clean (despite the constant abuse of female cleavage) with a PG-13 rating.  At the same time, if you watched Grown Ups and found it to be tedious to sit through, there's really no need to give this film a shot since very little has changed from the first film.  Grown Ups 2 is targeted towards a younger crowd and movie lovers that have followed Sandler or any one of his cast mates throughout their careers.  By now you should already know how you feel about the majority of the cast featured in this film.  Their brand of comedy can be a bit crude at times, but for the most part, it's innocent, wholesome fun for the entire family.  In any event, the diehard Adam Sandler fans out there probably already have their plans to see the film - and they won't be disappointed with the outcome of this film.  As far as everyone else goes, determining whether or not to see this sequel is a coin-flip and should depend on your ""kind"" of humor.Grade:  C+FNDNreview.com",3,Sandler returns for more summer fun

(Ba-dum-bum)  But seriously, folks, if you've ever wondered what it would be like to watch a movie almost entirely composed of deleted scenes that shouldn't go into the special features (let alone, the final script), you can stop wondering, because Grown Ups 2 is just that.  If you haven't seen the first Grown Ups, watch that one and forget this sequel ever existed.  If you did see the first Grown Ups and expect a coherent follow-up in the sequel, you're in for a big disappointment.Grown Ups 2 is a continuous sequence of mostly-lame gags, though there were a few genuinely funny parts that did did make us laugh.  There are no deleted scenes in the special features, because if they had deleted everything that should have been deleted, they would have only had enough material left to make a 3-5 minute webisode around each of the handful of funny bits.  There were two or three times in the last half hour where I thought they were finally setting up a big, incredible adventure, but it never materialized.  I guess I was okay with that, because the movie was already dragging on forever and starting the adventure at that point would have made it even longer.SPOILER ALERT=============The premise of Grown Ups 2 is that all four guys (three of whom are married with kids) have moved back to the hometown where they grew up, and now on the last day of school they're collectively having another mid-life crisis.  David Spade's character is set up as the worst off, having a teenage punk kid visiting from out of town--a son which the all-but-forgotten mother only told him about over the phone a couple days prior.  Supposedly the kid is in high school, but he looks like he's in his twenties.  Spade's character tries makes some wisecracks in an attempt to bond.  The kid obviously doesn't like him from the start but is willing to give him a chance.The four friends go back to their old hang-out spot so one of the guys can jump off a cliff into a lake (something which he always managed to find an excuse not to do back when they were  young) and finally earn his man card.  But there are a bunch of college kids hanging out at the lake, and up on the cliff the four grown-up male friends encounter a bunch of stereotypical fraternity jerks.could say the theme of the movie was ""bullies.""  Insults ensue, the four guys get ready to fight, then one of the frat boys makes a cheesy battle cry and an army of frat boys jumps out from behind bushes and rocks, surrounding the four doomed friends.  Frat boys make them jump off the cliff naked one at a time, with the other college party kids watching from the lower level of rocks on the other side of the water.  Kevin James lands on David Spade, who then cries, disgustedly, ""I was inside of you!""The middle part of the movie is basically a bunch of half-baked attempts at humor, desperately hoping the audience keeps watching until the two big showdowns at the end--it's almost like they didn't have a single professional comedy writer or script writer on the crew.Near the end, Sandler's character throws a big party.  The first showdown is with the main bully from Sandler's past (bully played by none other than Stone Cold Steve Austin).  This part is pretty much the one good bit of writing in the entire movie.  Sandler wants to teach his son how to be a man and stand up to bullies.  Upon hearing this, Austin's character (who has been a huge jerk the entire movie) can finally relate to Sandler and immediately hatches a plan--Sandler can punch him, and he'll go down like a sack of bricks.  The plan changes a bit as the two chat in their boxing poses, and eventually Stone Cold is cowering and pleading for mercy.  Sandler continues his trash talk to milk the situation for all it's worth, and then some.  After that situation is resolved, the frat boys show up for revenge because someone previously trashed their frat house and they assume it's the four Grown Ups whom they shamed earlier at the lake.  (As it turns out, Spade's son was the one who vandalized the frat house, but  nobody cares at this point.)

I was not impressed with the burp-snarts, nor the plethora of cleavage and groin shots. The jokes were at times cheesy, lots of slapstick humor, as well as some crude humor (which I come to expect in Sandlers movies).

Both movies are a classic Adam Sandler movies, just with a different plot line and some new characters. There's still plenty over the top situations with some crude elements, but still borderlines as family friendly. Still a lot of bad acting and jokes that kids won't get, but plenty that kids will and still has a little something for everyone. Believe it or not, the story, plot-line, and scenes of the first one were actually close to the realm of possiblity than a typical Adam Sandler movie.Second, while the first was in the realm of reality, the second one isn't. It basically starts a year later after all of the families decided to move back to their home town (Except for Rob Schneider's character...not sure what happened there). It's the last day of school for all their kids and the Dad's are having more fun reconnecting with their youth than the actual children. From the onset, the situations and story is just way crazy, but there are some pretty funny moments. Lot's of sappy, as well as, crude humor situations. Of course, a ton of celebrity guest appearences (Shaq Diesal, The Wolf Guy from Twilight, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Andy Sandberg, etc.). The story includes a significant part dedicated to a local fraternity of a-holes, which honestly are the highlights of the movie. Of course, the story and situations just get crazier as the movie goes on and as usual with Sandler movies...there's a sappy happy ending to wrap up everything.All in all, I (personally) was a little disapointed because I thought the story would be a tad bit more realistic, but in the end I knew better and it ended up being classic Adam Sandler.

The movie somehow managed to balance the requisite gross-out gags with some genuinely thoughtful and sophisticated humor about the compromises that come with growing up. The sequel, imaginatively named &#34;Grown Ups 2,&#34; is something else again, a movie that's every bit as epicene, juvenile and dumbed-down as one would have expected the original to be. Suffice it to say that any movie that starts off with a deer urinating on an unsuspecting suburban family has set a pretty low bar for itself. And &#34;Grown Ups 2&#34; lives down to those expectations just about every step of the way.The original had at least a semblance of a plot on which to hang its jokes, namely the men's coming together for a memorial service for their junior high school basketball coach who had recently died. Here the script is nothing more than a loosely strung-together series of misadventures as the &#34;boys&#34; roam around town getting into all sorts of mischief, some unlooked-for and some a product of their own making.As with any movie that employs three comedy writers - Adam Sandler, Tim Herlihy and Fred Wolf - to hash out the screenplay, there will inevitably be a few genuinely funny moments scattered throughout the film, but they are not enough to counter the barrage of urine, poop and vomit jokes that receive a much higher percentage of the screen time.The movie wastes a quality cast that includes Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Selma Hayek, Maya Rudolph, Steve Buscemi, Georgia Engel and Taylor Lautner.They - and we - deserve better.",2,Stunted growth,1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,1834,"['original', '34', 'Grown', 'Ups', '34', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'deft', 'endearing', 'comedy', 'least', 'managed', 'squeeze', 'modicum', 'quality', 'formulaic', 'tale', 'four', 'childlike', 'buddies', 'having', 'trouble', 'adjusting', 'obligations', 'responsibilities', 'come', 'middle', 'age', 'movie', 'somehow', 'managed', 'balance', 'requisite', 'gross-out', 'gags', 'genuinely', 'thoughtful', 'sophisticated', 'humor', 'compromises', 'come', 'growing', 'up', 'sequel', 'imaginatively', 'named', '34', 'Grown', 'Ups', '2', '34', 'something', 'else', 'again', 'movie', 'bit', 'epicene', 'juvenile', 'dumbed-down', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'original', 'be', 'Suffice', 'say', 'movie', 'deer', 'urinating', 'unsuspecting', 'suburban', 'family', 'set', 'pretty', 'low', 'bar', '34', 'Grown', 'Ups', '2', '34', 'down', 'expectations', 'just', 'step', 'way.The', 'original', 'had', 'least', 'semblance', 'plot', 'hang', 'jokes', 'namely', 'men', 'coming', 'together', 'memorial', 'service', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'coach', 'who', 'had', 'recently', 'died', 'Here', 'script', 'nothing', 'more', 'loosely', 'strung-together', 'series', 'misadventures', '34', 'boys', '34', 'roam', 'town', 'getting', 'sorts', 'mischief', 'unlooked-for', 'product', 'own', 'making.As', 'movie', 'three', 'comedy', 'writers', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Tim', 'Herlihy', 'Fred', 'Wolf', 'hash', 'out', 'screenplay', 'will', 'inevitably', 'be', 'few', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'scattered', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'counter', 'barrage', 'urine', 'poop', 'vomit', 'jokes', 'receive', 'much', 'higher', 'percentage', 'screen', 'time.The', 'movie', 'quality', 'cast', 'Sandler', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'David', 'Spade', 'Selma', 'Hayek', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Georgia', 'Engel', 'Taylor', 'Lautner.They', 'deserve', 'better']",N/A

On the last day of school for the year the gang all has individual problems that come up and deal with it in the only way they know how. As you may know by now I start all my reviews by summarizing the plot. This was the hardest part of the review for me, because there really wasn't a plot in this. The first movie was funny and did have a legitimate plot running through it and with this cast it made it hilarious and I really enjoyed it. I was looking forward to watching this but was a little leery. My worst suspicions came true. This is in no way terrible and it is worth watching but while the first one seemed like a movie this one was more...lets all hang out together and make a movie. There were some funny parts but it was more or less a series of SNL skits strung together. One scene had very little to do with the next one. All that said though it still is worth seeing but not even close to as good as the first one was. Overall, fans of this group and the first one will like it but don't expect to laugh as much as the original. I give it a B-.",3,With this crew it can't not be funny but this movie is missing a plot.
