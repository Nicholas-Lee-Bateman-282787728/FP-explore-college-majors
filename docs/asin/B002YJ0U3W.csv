1299212,A1MIB8NFBT6EC2,B002YJ0U3W,"Beatles Examiner Steve ""I love music""","[4, 5]","I'm a big fan of WII fitness games. I have several -- Wii Fit Plus, Active (I and II), Gold's Gym, to name the best. I was hesitant about buying this one because of the reviews. I was pleasantly surprised to findMy Fitness Coach 2: Exercise and Nutritiona great program.For one, it's completely different thanMy Fitness Coach(which I still love) and should be looked on as a complement, not a replacement, for it. MFC 2 has a completely different way of doing things. You still create a profile (though so far, after 2 weeks of doing it, not the physical challenge of MFC 1.). It creates an exercise program for you based on your goals, which you can change at any time. You can pick your workout location (which seem to be more limited than MFC 1, based on my early experience with it) and trainers (four, instead of just Myra of MFC 1).Each day's workout (which you find under the Fitness tab), eases you in at the beginning. If that's not enough, there are several shorter workouts you can do (Quick Workout, Before Breakfast, Before Lunch, After Dinner) in addition. Plus the Next Day's Workout is available in another tab if you still want to work out. There are also a series of challenges you can do which are at, for me, a higher level, but something to work into.Even though the workout is short (15 to 20 minutes early on), one thing I did notice that I like over MFC 1 -- the exercises seem to be more challenging. There were actually a couple I'll need to work a while to get through. I didn't have that problem with MFC 1.There is also nutritional information and recipes, based on your input of foods you like. The recipes look great, though I wish there was a way to print the recipes and shopping lists from the WII.All in all, I'm very very pleased with this game. As I said, it's not MFC 1. Don't buy it expecting that. One factor in WII fitness games is the response of the game to the remote. In my experience, the sensitivity is not perfect. That said, I still really love this game and recommend it. It's a well rounded system that will work you out. You may find you need to do more than one exercise routine a day, but that's no big deal really. It's a well rounded program with exercises and nutrition info to help you improve your life. It's helping me in the short time I've had it.ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AFTER 100 WORKOUTS: I have really grown to like this program. For those who are concerned about the length of the workouts, I treat them as a circuit, rather than a full-fledged workout. And I discovered by accident if you go back to do a second workout right after the first one, you get a different workout tailored to your second goal. And if you go back and do a third, you get another workout tailored to your first goal that will not be the same as the first workout you did. So you don't get the same workouts if you do more than one circuit at a time.The sensitivity of Wii balance board gets better as you do, at least in my experience. If you don't do the exercises completely correct or are straining to do them, the system will mark you off. In other words, it pushes you to do better. I've never been much on upper body strength and muscles, but this program is really working me hard there. (The press-ups are my daily hell, but I know they're really good for me.)All in all, I like this program even better than ever. Don't be swayed by the comments complaining about the intensity. It's very intense, but you need to do more than one circuit to get there.",4,And now for something completely different ...,1273536000,"05 11, 2010",2010,3500,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'WII', 'fitness', 'games', 'have', 'several', 'Wii', 'Fit', 'Plus', 'Active', 'II', 'Gold', 'Gym', 'name', 'best', 'was', 'hesitant', 'buying', 'one', 'reviews', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'findMy', 'Fitness', 'Coach', '2', 'Exercise', 'Nutritiona', 'great', 'program.For', 'one', 'completely', 'different', 'thanMy', 'Fitness', 'Coach', 'still', 'love', 'should', 'be', 'looked', 'complement', 'not', 'replacement', 'MFC', '2', 'completely', 'different', 'way', 'doing', 'things', 'still', 'create', 'profile', 'so', 'far', '2', 'weeks', 'doing', 'not', 'physical', 'challenge', 'MFC', '1.', 'exercise', 'program', 'based', 'goals', 'can', 'change', 'time', 'can', 'pick', 'workout', 'location', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'limited', 'MFC', '1', 'based', 'early', 'experience', 'trainers', 'four', 'instead', 'just', 'Myra', 'MFC', '1', '.Each', 'day', 'workout', 'find', 'Fitness', 'tab', 'beginning', 'not', 'enough', 'are', 'several', 'shorter', 'workouts', 'can', 'do', 'Quick', 'Workout', 'Breakfast', 'Lunch', 'Dinner', 'addition', 'Next', 'Day', 'Workout', 'available', 'tab', 'still', 'want', 'work', 'out', 'are', 'also', 'series', 'challenges', 'can', 'do', 'are', 'higher', 'level', 'something', 'work', 'into.Even', 'workout', 'short', '15', '20', 'minutes', 'early', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'notice', 'like', 'MFC', '1', 'exercises', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'challenging', 'were', 'actually', 'couple', ""'ll"", 'need', 'work', 'while', 'get', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'MFC', '1.There', 'also', 'nutritional', 'information', 'recipes', 'based', 'input', 'foods', 'like', 'recipes', 'look', 'great', 'wish', 'was', 'way', 'print', 'recipes', 'shopping', 'lists', 'WII.All', ""'m"", 'very', 'very', 'pleased', 'game', 'said', 'not', 'MFC', '1', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'expecting', 'One', 'factor', 'WII', 'fitness', 'games', 'response', 'game', 'remote', 'experience', 'sensitivity', 'not', 'perfect', 'said', 'still', 'really', 'love', 'game', 'recommend', 'well', 'rounded', 'system', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'may', 'find', 'need', 'do', 'more', 'one', 'exercise', 'routine', 'day', 'big', 'deal', 'really', 'well', 'rounded', 'program', 'exercises', 'nutrition', 'info', 'help', 'improve', 'life', 'helping', 'short', 'time', ""'ve"", 'had', 'it.ADDITIONAL', 'COMMENTS', 'AFTER', '100', 'WORKOUTS', 'have', 'really', 'grown', 'like', 'program', 'who', 'are', 'concerned', 'length', 'workouts', 'treat', 'circuit', 'rather', 'full-fledged', 'workout', 'discovered', 'accident', 'go', 'back', 'do', 'second', 'workout', 'right', 'first', 'one', 'get', 'different', 'workout', 'tailored', 'second', 'goal', 'go', 'back', 'do', 'third', 'get', 'workout', 'tailored', 'first', 'goal', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'first', 'workout', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'same', 'workouts', 'do', 'more', 'one', 'circuit', 'time.The', 'sensitivity', 'Wii', 'balance', 'board', 'better', 'do', 'least', 'experience', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'exercises', 'completely', 'correct', 'are', 'straining', 'do', 'system', 'will', 'mark', 'off', 'other', 'words', 'do', 'better', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'much', 'upper', 'body', 'strength', 'muscles', 'program', 'really', 'working', 'hard', 'there', 'press-ups', 'are', 'daily', 'hell', 'know', ""'re"", 'really', 'good', 'like', 'program', 'even', 'better', 'ever', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'swayed', 'comments', 'complaining', 'intensity', 'very', 'intense', 'need', 'do', 'more', 'one', 'circuit', 'get', 'there']",N/A

1299214,A2W4ST4L33BWXF,B002YJ0U3W,TheBeth,"[0, 0]","I read the reviews & was prepared for the worst when I bought it.  I decided to give it a try in hopes there would be something good about it.  I'm glad I did.  Granted, I would not have been happy paying the original full price, however I feel it's well worth the current amazon price of $7.00.  I just finished a quick workout focusing on my chosen goal of ""bums, tums & legs"" & yes I do indeed feel the effect on my muscles so the exercises seem to target correctly.  This is originally from the UK, although there's no british accent.  I consider this workout to be slow & controlled & I like that it uses the Wii Fit board & the motion plus remote.  I purposely slouched on some of the exercises to see if it would detect me slightly messing up & it did (the orb went from green to yellow to red in upper right corner of screen).  There are only 4 backgrounds, I wish there were more interior backgrounds than just the gym but that's the one I selected & it's ok).  2 male trainers & 2 female trainers to choose.  I chose the female (I always do on these games as I get annoyed at men telling me what to do & being critical - even virtual men. :) Both females have pleasant voices & are encouraging.  The instrumental not-memorable music is ok (not great but not annoying).  I chose a vegetarian eating lifestyle to see what it would come up with in the nutrition part.  I don't like to cook & I'm leaning toward veggie life more & more as I get older so I figured I 'd pretend I'm already vegan.  It actually came up with interesting facts about various veggies & fruits.  I didn't bother looking at the recipes, however I did learn a little I didn't know about.  (yes, I could find that info on line if I wanted to research it, but it's ok being on the game since it'll show you this info if you click on that part of menu - otherwise I can focus on exercises, progress & goals.  The menus are very fancy but you need a little patience to navigate when first playing this game.  I think the biggest complaint most reviewers on here have is that it is absolutely nothing like its predecessor.  I absolutely love the original my fitness coach & wish there really were a follow-up game to continue with Maya & her personality, exercises, music choices, time limit & more adorable backgrounds. This game should have been named something entirely different as it seems the company wanted to cash in on a successful game by using the same cover & name.  I am sure there were a lot of disappointed buyers when this game first came out.  I'm not disappointed because I read all the reviews ahead of time & mentally prepared myself for a game that would be completely not what the cover implied.  I'm glad there's a lot of usefulness in its exercises & I'm okay with the slowness of it.  Probably because I'm aching from the faster exercise games a couple days ago.  I recommend this game as an alternate exercise routine for when you want a change in your regular routines.  I consider this to be low-impact, although I noticed immediately that being forced to move slower on the lunging, push-ups, etc, I couldn't possibly rely on momentum to cheat, so it's actually more effective than the same exercises at a faster speed.  I didn't do the cardio yet, I only did the basic exercises.  (I prefer my cardio to be at the speed of Wii Zumba 1 & 2 or else I get bored).In summary:Cons: False advertising with the title would be a total turn-off if I had not been prepared that it's nothing like the first.Music could have been more upbeatShould have been at least 10 backgrounds to choose from - preferably 20.  Only 3 outdoor backgrounds & 1 indoor background isn't enough.No virtual trainer Maya & nothing like the predecessor.  I wish they had continued with same format.Pros: Uses wii motion control remote & wii balance board correctly.Has a basic feedback orb to let you know you're needing to duplicate trainer's moves better.Plenty of goals to choose from that will put the applicable exercises together in a workout.Tutorials for each exercise that you can skip by pressing A if you don't need instructions.Is a good exercise game for those days when you're not feeling physically ready to tackle fast high-impact exercise games.",4,Still effective although nothing like the original fitness coach,1326412800,"01 13,
