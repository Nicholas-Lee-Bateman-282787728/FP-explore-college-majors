Not to mention supporting players like Campbell Scott. Priceless photography by Vittorio  Storaro. And as usual with a Bertolucci film,grade &quot;A&quot; directing.  Then why am I only giving this movie one star? This might be a question you  might be asking yourself. Here's why. This film lacks a story! It's as  clear and simple as that. The beginning starts out promising,as we see the  Moresby's(Winger and Malkovich)headed on a trip to the Sahara along with a  friend (Scott)named Tunner. As the film progresses the story seems to have  gotten &quot;lost&quot;. We can't understand why the movie has went pass  the 20 minute mark. The longer the film goes on,the more and more you start  to wonder,what am I watching? Visually this is perfect! Story wise,this is  nothing more than a time waster. Which I'm really sorry to say because it  seemed like this movie had so much going for it,and to be ruined due to the  fact there was such a lack of story.

Erland,"[20, 23]","Synopsis: Rich, dissatisfied American couple, Port Moresby (John Malkovich) and his wife Kit Debra Winger), travel to exotic North Africa hoping adventure will renew some interest in their failing marriage. The two travelers temporarily become a trio with the addition of fellow American George Tunner (Campbell Scott). George however turns out to be more of a tourist than a traveler* and they soon part company as the Moresby travel deeper and deeper into the vast, arid landscape. The desert experience turns out to be more than anticipated and those who survive will be forever changed. In the final analysis isn't that what a adventure is supposed to accomplish?`The Sheltering Sky' released in '90 boasts a soundtrack of wonderfully ethnic music and some of the most beautiful cinematography you could ever hope for. Unfortunately in my opinion the plot falls short of delivering the full existential, introspective nature of the storyline. Artistic to a fault but it doesn't generate any interest in the chararacters. `The Sheltering Sky' is well worth a watch for the scenery alone, but it certainly would be a difficult repeat viewing for me.*[A tourist is someone who thinks about going home the moment they arrive, whereas a traveller might not come back at all].",3,"""No Names, No Dates, Just Pieces Of Broken Pottery"" ~ The Difference Between Tourist And Traveller",1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,1274,"['Synopsis', 'Rich', 'dissatisfied', 'American', 'couple', 'Port', 'Moresby', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'wife', 'Kit', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'travel', 'exotic', 'North', 'Africa', 'hoping', 'adventure', 'will', 'renew', 'interest', 'failing', 'marriage', 'two', 'travelers', 'temporarily', 'become', 'trio', 'addition', 'fellow', 'American', 'George', 'Tunner', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'George', 'however', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'tourist', 'traveler*', 'soon', 'part', 'company', 'Moresby', 'travel', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'vast', 'arid', 'landscape', 'desert', 'experience', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'anticipated', 'who', 'survive', 'will', 'be', 'forever', 'changed', 'final', 'analysis', ""n't"", 'what', 'adventure', 'supposed', 'accomplish', 'Sheltering', 'Sky', 'released', ""'90"", 'boasts', 'soundtrack', 'wonderfully', 'ethnic', 'music', 'most', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'Unfortunately', 'opinion', 'plot', 'short', 'delivering', 'full', 'existential', 'introspective', 'nature', 'storyline', 'Artistic', 'fault', ""n't"", 'generate', 'interest', 'chararacters', 'Sheltering', 'Sky', 'well', 'worth', 'watch', 'scenery', 'alone', 'certainly', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'repeat', 'viewing', '*', 'tourist', 'someone', 'who', 'going', 'home', 'moment', 'arrive', 'whereas', 'traveller', 'might', 'not', 'come', 'back', ']']",N/A
289801,A2PBV1899CX3TE,630200053X,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[4, 4]","The Sheltering Sky is based on the book of the same name by expatriate writer, composer, and traveler, Paul Bowles. Bowles himself has led quite an interesting life, besides appearing in a cameo and as the narrator of The Sheltering Sky, he has settled in Tangiers, Morocco, where he has lived for 52 years with his Jane, where their neighbor was William S. Burroughs. Another writer he met along the way was Christopher Isherwood who utilized his last name for the character of Sally Bowles in the story that provided the basis for the musical, Cabaret.Port Moresby (John Malkovich) would seem to be modeled on Bowles himself; however, there are some important differences. In an autobiography, the one thing that you can be reasonably sure of is the protagonist will not die, but to think that The Sheltering Sky is an autobiography is a fatal assumption. Though based on autobiographical elements, midway through the narrative the main character slips away, and thereafter the focus shifts to his wife, Kit Moresby (Debra Winger). Since she has been having a clandestine affair with a traveling companion, George Tunner (Campbell Scott) you might think that the story would culminate in the lovers reuniting, but again that would be a false assumption. Kit's journey is a long and strange one, and any meaning that can be inferred by it is somewhat esoteric.Director Benardo Bertolucci is best known for The Last Tango in Paris, and also for The Last Emperor. Stealing Beauty was another interesting effort. The Sheltering Sky falls somewhere in between the Zenith and Nadir. There are great location shots filmed in the North African Sahara desert, but there are also lots of scenes where it just looks so ugly. At one point, they are almost covered in flies, and often times Port Moresby stares off into the desert seeing a beauty only visible to him. Is he being ironic when he announces that the hotel is magnificent? Indeed, Port Moresby is quite an enigma and who better to portray him than John Malkovich? He is a curious mixture of shrewdness and naivet&eacute;. For instance, he steals his wallet back from a prostitute but can't resist flaunting it as he leaves, causing her to sound the alarm. Or when the parasitic tourist Eric Lyle (Timothy Spall) tries to borrow money he dispenses tough love, but then leaves his valuables unattended. Port Moresby is, by the way, the capital city of Papua New Guinea.My favorite Malkovich moment was when Kit comments on the French colonials.-----Kit Moresby: Someday they're gonna kick the French out of this country.Port Moresby: Well, with trousers like that, who can blame them?==============He also exhibits his shrewd/naive dichotomy when he conspires to split Tunner off from their traveling party:-----Kit Moresby: Is that the plan?Port Moresby: More or less, yes.Kit Moresby: More or less?Port Moresby: Uh... Less, actually.===================Like John Malkovich, Debra Winger has also had quite an interesting life and career. Her voice was used for E.T. and she played Wonder Girl on the Wonder Woman television program. She later spoofed this on Letterman where she appeared wearing a flowing robe. Dave played a clip of Winger as Wonder Girl and she pretended to be annoyed. She stood up to leave, dropped the robe, and revealed her Wonder Girl costume as she ran off through the audience. Her break out role was as Sissy in Urban Cowboy, riding the mechanical bull to fame, but she also scored big with Terms of Endearment and An Officer and a Gentleman. She did an excellent job in The Sheltering Sky, in a very demanding role. The experience must have really moved her, as she remained there in the desert for more than a year after filming was finished. Lately, she is getting raves again for Rachel Getting Married.Campbell Scott's job in The Sheltering Sky was to be handsome but somewhat shallow.-----Kit Moresby: Oh, Tunner, stop trying to be interesting. On you it looks terrible. And you're too good-looking.====================Some other notable roles of Campbell Scott were in Longtime Companion, which was the first film to tackle the AIDs epidemic, and in Cameron Crowe's Singles, which tried but failed to define Generation X. In retrospect that would have to be Reality Bites, sorry Campbell and Cameron.Timothy Spall had a small but memorable role as reluctant tourist Eric Lyle. An accomplished character actor, there is no one else who can so effectively portray multiple character flaws as Spall. Catch his act as the road manager in Rock Star, or as The Mikado in Topsy-Turvy by Mike Leigh.Though the cast and location are compelling, it failed to add up to much. Paul Bowles wasn't really impressed with the film. I enjoyed The Sheltering Sky, but have to judge it harshly with a mere three stars. And yet, I would recommend it as a journey worth taking. And the book would definitely be worth reading.The Sheltering Sky (P.S.)Last Tango in ParisThe Last Emperor - Criterion CollectionStealing BeautyRock StarTopsy-TurvyBeing John MalkovichSearching for Debra WingerUrban CowboySingles-----Tunner: You've been to North Africa before, Port.

289802,A2JXAQ92WYPAAR,630200053X,"David Schweizer ""Almawood""","[5, 6]","I love Bertolucci and I love Paul Bowles, but I think this movie fails both artists. It is, of course, a stunning visual masterpiece, as usual it must be said, because of the cinematographer. It is luscious and hypnotic, no doubt about that. I think the weakness is in the cast who, although talented in their own ways, really fail here. Winger is capable of greatness; she is terrific in many films, but here she seems so weak, no passionless. Malkovich is the darling of the art set, but doesn't really have it as far as I am concerned. His is a peculiarly neurotic sort of masculine power. He pouts and purses his lips, and sulks. By now he has got this down as though it were a comic routine. He seems all wrong for this role. I liked the scenes of Winger out in the desert with the Bedouin; this is a real S/M fantasy if there ever was one, but I don't think the ending has much resonance. When she runs back into the casbah, it isn't clear in the movie as it is in the novel that she has nothing to go back to. Partly this is due to the odd framing device with the elderly Bowles reading from the text in that awful monotone voice of his. Nostalgia is not the right note to strike but there it is.

289803,ADKZOXAOV8EXD,630200053X,Doctor.Generosity,"[1, 1]","Paul Bowles' classic novel of American travelers meeting tragedy in North Africa was turned into a visually compelling but dramatically flawed movie. The carefully structured plot of lives unraveling in a harsh region was not faithfully transferred to film, in part because the director chickened out on the more difficult parts of the story. For example, after the horrendous death of her husband from typhoid, the bereft widow played by Debra Winger, now completely on her own in the desert, is kidnapped by a nomad caravan and taken as a sex slave. The movie makes this part, which in the book further devastates a woman already crushed by her loss, seem more like ""cute American wife quickly falls for hot new boyfriend.""Debra Winger carries her part well, but John Malkovitch just overacts with the same arrogant and annoying persona as in all his other movies. How this johnny-one-note came to be regarded as a great actor is beyond me.

289805,A280GY5UVUS2QH,630200053X,Doug Anderson,"[4, 6]","This film just doesn't work because we never really are given enough information about what is going on with these characters. if the actors are going for subtelty, its too subtle. Malkvovich just doesn't have the right kind of personality to project (or have) the kinds of thoughts Bowles' character Port has. Malkovich plays mocking and witty very well so he was perfect for Dangerous Liasons but he does not play sincere well so to cast him as the tortured intellectual Port is an odd choice. And Debra Winger is wrong too. Her Kit is rather flat, she projects none of the troubled dimensions and barely restrained restless energy that the novels character has. In fact Port and Kit in the book are really more like brother and sister (in the Cocteau sense, mirroring and protecting each other, like child companions) than man and wife because what unites them is not sexual attraction. In the novel we meet Port in a very late phase of his discontent, the terminal phase, and nothing short of a tete a tete with oblivion will do for him. Life in his view is nothing but  nasty brutish and short and so he sees no reason to prolong it, all that can be done is to heighten the sensations the unbearable circumstance of life arouses. A sort of romantic poets vision,  or its American equivalent (ie Poe) who Bowles loved. Kit also can not quite find the will to live within the normal dimensions of the world but she still has a strong life urge though(often erotic) and this is what creates the rift between them(one suspects in the novel that Port is homosexual).  And that rift is only partly camouflaged by the third party friend of both played by Campbell Scott(whom both characters desire and so their sexual desire, ironically, tears them apart). Scott is a boring actor but then his character isn't supposed to be as multidimensional as Port and Kit, he simply mediates between these two creative souls . The actors don't convey any of this though.  The actors just don;t seem to know what they are supposed to be doing with these roles. Part of the problem is that what takes place between Kit and Port is non dramatic, anti-climactic, all that they have been through together took place before they arrived in North Africa. We meet them when they are already stranded from each other, this works very well in the book because we are given enough clues to understand what their history together has been. The movie remains a big blank page though. Desert footage serves to fill space but doesn't tell you much about the real drama of Sheltering Sky which is the  unraveling psychic horror that Port is experiencing. Its just not there in this film. Malkovich isn't the right actor but even the right actor couldn't pull this off in all probablity( a young Terence Stamp perhaps.., he had the haunted and isolated, utterly cut off aura necessary). The long ending is a beautiful piece of cinematography( it pleasantly just sort of drifts along like a lullaby for the eyes, what more lovely thing than a caravan moving by night under stars?) but nothing more and one imagines even those involved in the making of this were asking themselves by films end,  &quot;now what is this picture about?&quot;. I love Bertolucci films, he is perhaps the best director out there still making intelligent movies.

289808,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,630200053X,Hikari,"[29, 41]","Paul Bowles' novel of self-discovery in the Sahara is one of my favorite books of all time.  So I looked forward with great anticipation to Bernardo Bertolucci's film version.  The desert makes a great setting for film as amply illustrated by such films as Lawrence of Arabia and The English Patient.  Although Bertolucci and cinematographer succeed brilliantly in evoking the images and atmosphere of postwar North Africa, on other levels the effort is decidedly mixed.For me the flaws lie primarily with the casting of the leads.  John Malkovich and Debra Winger both turn in earnestly game performances as Port and Kit Moresby, a couple of self-centered, idle rich New Yorkers who come to Africa with the purpose of having an adventure to spice up their 10-year-old marriage and distract themselves from their increasing emotional distance.  Both Port and Kit pride themselves on being &quot;travellers&quot; rather than mere tourists, as they explain rather pompously to their travelling companion, a mutual and barely tolerated acquaintance who has his eye on Kit.  All three travel with a ridiculous amount of luggage and it is soon clear that style rather than substance rule Kit and Port's world and that they are just drifting aimlessly through life without any clear goals because they have the financial means to do so.Kit and Port are figures straight out of Fitzgerald--young, stylish, self-absorbed and devoid of any moral compass.  Malkovich is badly miscast as the urbane and intellectual Port, a man struggling to retain his preconceived ideas of how to live in a completely alien atmosphere where things are rapidly falling apart.  Malkovich has none of Port's slightly girlish beauty or polished manners that Bowles describes, and his flat, light voice is annoying and makes throwaways of some of Bowles' excellent dialogue.  Malkovich excels at playing malevolent characters, and always exudes a sinister aura, which is totally wrong for Port.  Port lacks backbone and empathy with others, being too enamored of what goes on inside his own head, but he is not evil.Debra Winger fares a little better as Kit, whose personal oddysey becomes the focus of the story.  She too is physically wrong for the part--dark and earthy where Bowles' Kit is fair, fragile and projects an air of helplessness, at least in the early part of the book.  Winger is too gutsy for Kit, and also too much of a mature woman.  Her attempts at disingeniousness seem forced and silly, since with her whiskey laugh and voluptuous limbs, she is obviously in charge of herself and seems unlikely to be the helpless victim of circumstances that Kit is.  Her husky Midwestern-ness is also at odds with the cultured Eastern society debutante of Bowles' book.  She looks fabulous in the period costumes, however, and as her character goes deeper into the desert, both literally and figuratively speaking, the character grows into Winger, rather than the other way around.Cambell Scott, Timothy Spall and Jill Bennett are strong in supporting roles, at times threatening to overshadow the two leads.  Ryuichi Sakamoto's score is haunting but at times too jarring for the action.  The dialog is at times heavy and the motivations opaque; the author (who has a cameo in the film as a mysterious blind man glimpsed in a bar--he also provides narration) has written a story of a journey that is more interior than exterior; as a result it does not translate easily to film.  I highly recommend reading the novel prior to viewing the movie so you can tell what's going on in this visually gorgeous yet unsettling and ultimately unsatisfying film.",3,The Stifling Sky,979257600,"01 12, 2001",2001,3626,"['Paul', 'Bowles', 'novel', 'self-discovery', 'Sahara', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'time', 'So', 'looked', 'forward', 'great', 'anticipation', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'film', 'version', 'desert', 'great', 'setting', 'film', 'amply', 'illustrated', 'such', 'films', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'English', 'Patient', 'Bertolucci', 'cinematographer', 'succeed', 'brilliantly', 'evoking', 'images', 'atmosphere', 'postwar', 'North', 'Africa', 'other', 'levels', 'effort', 'decidedly', 'mixed.For', 'flaws', 'lie', 'primarily', 'casting', 'leads', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'turn', 'earnestly', 'game', 'performances', 'Port', 'Kit', 'Moresby', 'couple', 'self-centered', 'idle', 'rich', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'who', 'come', 'Africa', 'purpose', 'having', 'adventure', 'spice', 'up', '10-year-old', 'marriage', 'distract', 'increasing', 'emotional', 'distance', 'Port', 'Kit', 'pride', 'being', 'quot', 'travellers', 'quot', 'rather', 'mere', 'tourists', 'explain', 'rather', 'pompously', 'travelling', 'companion', 'mutual', 'barely', 'tolerated', 'acquaintance', 'who', 'eye', 'Kit', 'three', 'travel', 'ridiculous', 'amount', 'luggage', 'soon', 'clear', 'style', 'rather', 'substance', 'rule', 'Kit', 'Port', 'world', 'are', 'just', 'drifting', 'aimlessly', 'life', 'clear', 'goals', 'have', 'financial', 'means', 'do', 'so.Kit', 'Port', 'are', 'figures', 'straight', 'Fitzgerald', 'young', 'stylish', 'self-absorbed', 'devoid', 'moral', 'compass', 'Malkovich', 'badly', 'miscast', 'urbane', 'intellectual', 'Port', 'man', 'struggling', 'retain', 'preconceived', 'ideas', 'how', 'live', 'completely', 'alien', 'atmosphere', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'rapidly', 'falling', 'apart', 'Malkovich', 'none', 'Port', 'slightly', 'girlish', 'beauty', 'polished', 'manners', 'Bowles', 'flat', 'light', 'voice', 'annoying', 'throwaways', 'Bowles', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'Malkovich', 'playing', 'malevolent', 'characters', 'always', 'sinister', 'aura', 'totally', 'wrong', 'Port', 'Port', 'backbone', 'empathy', 'others', 'being', 'too', 'enamored', 'what', 'own', 'head', 'not', 'evil.Debra', 'Winger', 'little', 'better', 'Kit', 'personal', 'oddysey', 'focus', 'story', 'too', 'physically', 'wrong', 'part', 'dark', 'earthy', 'where', 'Bowles', 'Kit', 'fair', 'fragile', 'projects', 'air', 'helplessness', 'least', 'early', 'part', 'book', 'Winger', 'too', 'gutsy', 'Kit', 'also', 'too', 'much', 'mature', 'woman', 'attempts', 'disingeniousness', 'seem', 'forced', 'silly', 'whiskey', 'laugh', 'voluptuous', 'limbs', 'obviously', 'charge', 'herself', 'unlikely', 'be', 'helpless', 'victim', 'circumstances', 'Kit', 'husky', 'Midwestern-ness', 'also', 'odds', 'cultured', 'Eastern', 'society', 'debutante', 'Bowles', 'book', 'fabulous', 'period', 'costumes', 'however', 'character', 'deeper', 'desert', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'speaking', 'character', 'Winger', 'rather', 'other', 'way', 'Scott', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Jill', 'Bennett', 'are', 'strong', 'supporting', 'roles', 'times', 'threatening', 'overshadow', 'two', 'leads', 'Ryuichi', 'Sakamoto', 'score', 'haunting', 'times', 'too', 'jarring', 'action', 'dialog', 'times', 'heavy', 'motivations', 'opaque', 'author', 'who', 'cameo', 'film', 'mysterious', 'blind', 'man', 'glimpsed', 'bar', 'also', 'narration', 'written', 'story', 'journey', 'more', 'interior', 'exterior', 'result', 'not', 'translate', 'easily', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'reading', 'novel', 'prior', 'viewing', 'movie', 'can', 'tell', 'what', 'going', 'visually', 'gorgeous', 'yet', 'unsettling', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfying', 'film']",N/A

289811,A1WTYALNQNQG99,630200053X,Larry L. Looney,"[75, 85]","Director Bernardo Bertolucci is the perfect choice for bringing Paul Bowles incredible novel -- one of the most finely crafted of the 20th century and one of my favorite books -- to the screen.  Debra Winger and John Malkovich are fine as Kit and Port -- spoiled, bored, EMPTY Americans 'travelling' (NOT tourists) in Morocco just after WWII.  Their journey -- one of self-discovery and an attempt to bring some life back into their marriage -- turns from one of idle fascination with an exotic culture (one in which Bowles, the author, immersed himself long ago, one which he loved unabashedly) turns into a trip to hell.  Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.Campbell Scott is also good in the role of their friend Tunner, and the Lyles -- the fawning Eric and his intolerably superior mother -- are every bit as disgusting as they seem.  Some viewers have found these latter two portrayals to be a bit 'over the top' -- but they're completely irritating characters, whining and complaining constantly about the conditions in which they chose to place themselves.  They are the biting fleas you cannot remove from your sleeping bag, no matter how long you search for them.Filmed on location in the African desert, the film resounds and shines with Bertolucci's touch -- if it seems long and slow in places, those characteristic accurately portray the atmosphere of life in desert Morocco.  The unbelievable heat would tend to slow things down a bit.  The director's use of camera angles, light, and those long, slow, sweeping shots are masterful and perfect.  Bowles was consulted every step of the way -- a sign of the respect held for the author and his work by the director -- and he even appears in the film and supplies narration.I am amazed that a film of this scope, made by a director of Bertolucci's stature, with two of the most critically acclaimed actors of our time, has not appeared on DVD.  There's a wonderful documentary called DESERT ROSES: THE MAKING OF 'THE SHELTERING SKY' that would make a nice piece of bonus material for a DVD release.  When the film was shown on BRAVO, that network had the good taste to run the documentary along with it.

289816,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,630200053X,Mr. Cairene,"[10, 13]","&quot;We are not tourists, we are travellers&quot; says Port Moresby(John  Malkovich) as he, his wife Kit(Debra Winger) and their garrulous friend  George Tunner(Campbell Scott) arrive on the shores of Tangiers. Tunner,  young and rich as he is, seems to be accompanying them for the hell of it.  Why exactly the two principle protagonists choose to embark on such a  labyrinthine and possibly one way journey deep into the Sahara is never  made clear. There is ofcourse that universal, hokey and meaningless reason  of &quot;finding oneself in an uncorrupted land&quot;. If I had to guess,  then I would say that this couple is trying escape from themselves, from  their probationary relationship with each other. Perhaps the ruggedness of  this adventure will filter their emotions, purify the love that is  obviously still there. Or maybe they were just bored. One thing for sure,  Bertolucci's epic requires you to do a lot of guessing.Initially the  film looks like its going to be an intriguing  love triangle drama. There  are even hints of an unconventional sexual relationship between husband and  wife. For instance, after Port spends the night with a Nomadic prostitute,  he returns to find Tunner in his bedroom(seperate but adjoining his  wife's), &quot;What was he doing in my bedroom?&quot; he asks her over  dinner. &quot;He was waiting for me to get dressed?&quot; she answers quite  truthfully.&quot;But you didn't tell me where you where last night?&quot;  she counters.&quot;You didn't ask&quot; he replies. &quot;And I'm never  going to&quot; she finally says. Alas, this triangle is quickly abandoned  by the screenplay in favour of several self-contained episodes as the trio  travel from one town to another. A sub-plot involving a mother/son duo of  fellow expatriots who may or may not be con artists is introduced and never  followed up. Infact The Sheltering Sky suffers a complete narrative  meltdown at about its midway point. We get a final hour that seems like a  National Geographic special, only without the commentary. Yet I was  transfixed by the film's visual splendor even when I was sure it was going  nowhere.Like the Egyptian desert(which I often observe travelling  from Cairo to Alexandria and back), the Sahara desert is vast succession of  freeform sandhills that are silhouetted by the wind into what looks like  brown cream. It is as beautiful as it is harsh. Bernardo Bertolucci and his  cinematographer Vittorio Storaro exploit both of these qualities to maximum  effect. There are moments in The Sheltering Sky when you are exhilerated by  the desert's vastness and others when you are suffocated by the  endless  gusts of sand.The Sheltering Sky marks the reteaming of director  Bertolucci, co-screenwriter Mark Peploe and producer Jeremy Thomas after  the multi-Oscar winning The Last Emperor. It is interesting to note that in  both films, the protagonist(s) are caught in a chain of event beyond their  control. But in the vastly superior The Last Emperor that was precisely the  point, a clueless young man who was played for a fool by the many  opportunists around him. In The Sheltering Sky there are no opportunists,  the characters have placed themselves in this position for reason known  only to themsleves. The setting of the film draws comparison to The English  Patient, but Minghella's Oscar winner is a multi-layered masterpiece about  obligation, possessivness and the love affair that fuels them, within a  still more fascinating framework of war. The Sheltering Sky is not a  masterpiece, it just looks like one.In the end I had the feeling I was  watching a stunning, if largely inexplicable visual companion to a novel I  hadn't read. By all acounts Paul Bowles's source novel is a masterwork that  explores its themes(whatever they are) to the fullest extent. I'm inclined  to agree with the reviewer below that the film has no story, something I  generally don't mind. What bothers me is that for such an important looking  film, it is one with no theme, no purpose for being. As a journey into an  exotic land, The Sheltering Sky is an experience worth having, even if  we're experiencing it through the eyes of characters who for 137 minutes  remain just as foreign as the land they occupy.",3,Shelter From Thyself,968457600,"09 9, 2000",2000,4265,"['quot', 'are', 'not', 'tourists', 'are', 'travellers', 'quot', 'Port', 'Moresby', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'wife', 'Kit', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'garrulous', 'friend', 'George', 'Tunner', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'arrive', 'shores', 'Tangiers', 'Tunner', 'young', 'rich', 'be', 'accompanying', 'hell', 'Why', 'exactly', 'two', 'principle', 'protagonists', 'choose', 'embark', 'labyrinthine', 'possibly', 'one', 'way', 'journey', 'deep', 'Sahara', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'ofcourse', 'universal', 'hokey', 'meaningless', 'reason', 'quot', 'finding', 'uncorrupted', 'land', 'quot', 'had', 'guess', 'then', 'would', 'say', 'couple', 'trying', 'escape', 'probationary', 'relationship', 'other', 'Perhaps', 'ruggedness', 'adventure', 'will', 'filter', 'emotions', 'purify', 'love', 'obviously', 'still', 'there', 'maybe', 'were', 'just', 'bored', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'Bertolucci', 'epic', 'do', 'lot', 'guessing.Initially', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'intriguing', 'love', 'triangle', 'drama', 'are', 'even', 'hints', 'unconventional', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'husband', 'wife', 'instance', 'Port', 'night', 'Nomadic', 'prostitute', 'find', 'Tunner', 'bedroom', 'seperate', 'adjoining', 'wife', 'quot', 'What', 'was', 'doing', 'bedroom', 'quot', 'dinner', 'quot', 'was', 'waiting', 'get', 'dressed', 'quot', 'quite', 'truthfully.', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'where', 'where', 'last', 'night', 'quot', 'counters.', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'ask', 'quot', 'quot', ""'m"", 'never', 'going', 'quot', 'finally', 'Alas', 'triangle', 'quickly', 'abandoned', 'screenplay', 'favour', 'several', 'self-contained', 'episodes', 'trio', 'travel', 'one', 'town', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'mother/son', 'duo', 'fellow', 'expatriots', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'con', 'artists', 'introduced', 'never', 'followed', 'up', 'Infact', 'Sheltering', 'Sky', 'complete', 'narrative', 'meltdown', 'midway', 'point', 'get', 'final', 'hour', 'National', 'Geographic', 'special', 'only', 'commentary', 'was', 'transfixed', 'film', 'visual', 'splendor', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'sure', 'was', 'going', 'Egyptian', 'desert', 'often', 'observe', 'travelling', 'Cairo', 'Alexandria', 'back', 'Sahara', 'desert', 'vast', 'succession', 'freeform', 'sandhills', 'are', 'silhouetted', 'wind', 'what', 'brown', 'cream', 'as', 'beautiful', 'harsh', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'cinematographer', 'Vittorio', 'Storaro', 'exploit', 'qualities', 'maximum', 'effect', 'are', 'moments', 'Sheltering', 'Sky', 'when', 'are', 'exhilerated', 'desert', 'vastness', 'others', 'when', 'are', 'suffocated', 'endless', 'gusts', 'sand.The', 'Sheltering', 'Sky', 'reteaming', 'director', 'Bertolucci', 'co-screenwriter', 'Mark', 'Peploe', 'producer', 'Jeremy', 'Thomas', 'multi-Oscar', 'winning', 'Last', 'Emperor', 'interesting', 'note', 'films', 'protagonist', 's', 'are', 'caught', 'chain', 'event', 'control', 'vastly', 'Last', 'Emperor', 'was', 'precisely', 'point', 'clueless', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'played', 'fool', 'many', 'opportunists', 'Sheltering', 'Sky', 'are', 'opportunists', 'characters', 'have', 'placed', 'position', 'reason', 'known', 'only', 'themsleves', 'setting', 'film', 'comparison', 'English', 'Patient', 'Minghella', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'multi-layered', 'masterpiece', 'obligation', 'possessivness', 'love', 'affair', 'still', 'more', 'fascinating', 'framework', 'war', 'Sheltering', 'Sky', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'just', 'end', 'had', 'feeling', 'was', 'watching', 'stunning', 'largely', 'inexplicable', 'visual', 'companion', 'novel', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'acounts', 'Paul', 'Bowles', 'source', 'novel', 'masterwork', 'themes', 'are', 'fullest', 'extent', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'film', 'story', 'something', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'What', 'important', 'looking', 'film', 'one', 'theme', 'purpose', 'being', 'journey', 'exotic', 'land', 'Sheltering', 'Sky', 'experience', 'worth', 'having', 'even', ""'re"", 'experiencing', 'eyes', 'characters', 'who', '137', 'minutes', 'remain', 'just', 'as', 'foreign', 'land', 'occupy']",N/A

That isn't Bernado Bertolucci's fault, of course: Paul Bowles' novel of the same name is an intensely annoying, pretentious book. Bertolucci has, if anything, improved on the raw material in the parts he has left out, but fundamentally he can still be brought to book for filming it the first place.I have only recently finished reading The Sheltering Sky. I hated it. When I read the glowing, passionate reviews of pretty much every reviewer on Amazon, I thought I must have missed something, or completely misunderstood the book. Just to check, I got hold of the movie. To my tremendous relief, I now see I didn't (or, if I did, then so did Bertolucci): the film is pretty much exactly how I imagined it would be.Malkovich nails the Port Moresby character (how odd, incidentally, to name your lead character after a place in Papua New Guinea). Port is what the Brits would describe in their inimitable way as a ""complete wanker"".Debra Winger captures Kit Moresby's high-tensile stupidity perfectly. In her opening scene, she wigs out after roughly fifteen seconds of an innocuous conversation because she doesn't want Port to talk about a dream he has had, lest Tunner should repeat it back in New York. But then within twenty minutes, she's having sexual intercourse with Tunner behind Port's back, apparently without a second thought to the stir this might create back home should Tunner happen to mention it.Port is no cuckold, though: Even before Kit's infidelity, he has, during the course of an evening stroll, wound up having it off with a Bedouin prostitute at the edge of town.Thereafter, disaffection for the protagonists is total. It is impossible to care a fig whether either lives or dies, and the only value the film offers is the satisfaction of seeing that one of them does eventually die, together with a star comedy turn by Timothy Spall, Bertolucci's luscious cinematography, and a number of gratuitous shots of Debra Winger's nether regions.None of which is reason enough to rent this for an evening, sad to say.Olly Buxton",3,Good dramatisation of a terrible book,1081468800,"04 9, 2004",2004,2344,"['churlish', 'not', 'rate', 'more', 'highly', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'set', 'out', 'achieve', 'think', 'have', 'judge', 'film', 'overall', 'impression', 'beautiful', 'probably', 'elegiac', 'still', 'intensely', 'annoying', 'film', 'couple', 'very', 'dislikeable', 'people', ""n't"", 'Bernado', 'Bertolucci', 'fault', 'course', 'Paul', 'Bowles', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'intensely', 'annoying', 'pretentious', 'book', 'Bertolucci', 'anything', 'improved', 'raw', 'material', 'parts', 'left', 'out', 'fundamentally', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'brought', 'book', 'filming', 'first', 'place.I', 'have', 'only', 'recently', 'finished', 'reading', 'Sheltering', 'Sky', 'hated', 'When', 'read', 'glowing', 'passionate', 'reviews', 'pretty', 'much', 'reviewer', 'Amazon', 'thought', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'something', 'completely', 'misunderstood', 'book', 'Just', 'check', 'got', 'hold', 'movie', 'tremendous', 'relief', 'now', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', 'then', 'so', 'did', 'Bertolucci', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'exactly', 'how', 'imagined', 'would', 'be.Malkovich', 'Port', 'Moresby', 'character', 'how', 'odd', 'incidentally', 'name', 'lead', 'character', 'place', 'Papua', 'New', 'Guinea', 'Port', 'what', 'Brits', 'would', 'describe', 'inimitable', 'way', 'complete', 'wanker', 'Winger', 'Kit', 'Moresby', 'high-tensile', 'stupidity', 'perfectly', 'opening', 'scene', 'wigs', 'out', 'roughly', 'fifteen', 'seconds', 'innocuous', 'conversation', ""n't"", 'want', 'Port', 'talk', 'dream', 'had', 'lest', 'Tunner', 'should', 'repeat', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'then', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'having', 'sexual', 'intercourse', 'Tunner', 'Port', 'back', 'apparently', 'second', 'thought', 'stir', 'might', 'create', 'back', 'home', 'should', 'Tunner', 'happen', 'mention', 'it.Port', 'cuckold', 'Even', 'Kit', 'infidelity', 'course', 'evening', 'stroll', 'wound', 'up', 'having', 'off', 'Bedouin', 'prostitute', 'edge', 'town.Thereafter', 'disaffection', 'protagonists', 'total', 'impossible', 'care', 'fig', 'dies', 'only', 'value', 'film', 'offers', 'satisfaction', 'seeing', 'one', 'eventually', 'die', 'together', 'star', 'comedy', 'turn', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Bertolucci', 'luscious', 'cinematography', 'number', 'gratuitous', 'shots', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'nether', 'regions.None', 'reason', 'enough', 'rent', 'evening', 'sad', 'say.Olly', 'Buxton']",N/A

People having sex running into people who had strange personalities but didn't seem to fit into the story at all not that there was a story which may be why there wasn't one. They only thing I got out of this was seeing north Africa (or what appeared to be) scenery and what appeared to be local customs/people, not that I cared to see that/them. The conversations between the characters were incoherent, incomplete, and jibberish. The love that was supposed to be between the two main characters was not even developed so the makers/writers for the movie just took it for granted the audience saw/thought there was love and would be troubled by the climatic events which I was not. I mean the events in themselves were pretty bad as situations but to the characters as a married couple-no. John M played the same part he plays in every movie I have seen him in: that of a quiet spoken effeminate man who seems to speak to people in a way that mocks them and derides them . . in a childish way . . . like a spoiled 13 year old brat. Debra W plays the same part she plays in every movie I have seen her in: that of a silly somewhat whacky 12 y/o immature girl who snorts at odd moments in conversations while sitting around slumped over herself or table looking slouchy and in another world. Of course this movie tried to create an allure of an independent art flick so of course the male genitalia had to be paraded out in full frontal nudity. . . in a gratuitous way, which was weird and off putting in the same way that a man would go have sex with a local savage prostitute. Also the gratitious sex continues when we are supposed to think, as Americans I guess, that the woman would be be rolling around having sex with a male local savage, who is her semi captor, who beforehand just grunts, grabs, and stares like an animal at her.

There is so much wrong with this weird movie that I wonder why I had allowed it to  rob me of however many minutes it lasts of my life . . . because it seems to linger.

289823,A5TZXWU8AALIC,630200053X,The JuRK,"[14, 14]","I couldn't find the edition I read of ""The Sheltering Sky"" here on [...] but my copy includes an introduction by Paul Bowles written a year or so before he died.  In the introduction, he says ""the less said about the film version, the better.""(His only other comment about the film was to mock the filmmakers for trying to make Debra Winger look like his wife Jane and sell the story as a thinly-veiled account of their trip into the Sahara...a trip that Bowles swears he never took with Jane).I'd seen the movie before reading the book and was intrigued with the story enough to read the novel.  Then I watched the movie again.  The film is certainly more interesting if you've read the book.  That's probably because you can follow the inner thoughts and feelings (or lack of feelings) of the characters, something you'd only have to guess at while watching the film otherwise.  It seemed to me that some really good dialogue was left out of the film between Port and Kit, especially in their final scenes.  (That some of this dialogue was given to the author during his cameo at the beginning and end of the film didn't make it any easier either).I love John Malkovich but I think he's not really right for Port.  Port comes across (to me) as a vain, handsome but empty man stubbornly trying to free himself from his privileged existence.  Malkovich is too intense and interesting, too unpredictable to be a pretty boy foolishly blundering through the Sahara to shake himself off.  He's a great actor but his talents obscures this character (again, my opinion).And I've really learned to appreciate Debra Winger.  She really is one of this country's finest actresses, taking on some really tough roles and making them work.  When she's left to carry the movie by herself, I wished there had been more scenes earlier to draw her character out more.  Three years after this film, she was also great in ""Shadowlands"" with Anthony Hopkins.The brutality of the novel is downplayed when Kit wanders off to join a caravan late in the film.  In the movie, she becomes involved with an Arab trader like a mini-romance where she eventually gives herself to him.  In the novel, she's immediately passed between the two men leading the caravan and accepts her total loss of identity.  I think you'll agree there's a huge difference between a romance and a rape, right?But the film follows the storyline somewhat faithfully and has some really wonderful photography of the Sahara Desert.  I thought the ending was a little confusing...until I read the book and rewatched it.  I'm sure the movie will be more interesting if you did that...I'm just not sure you'd want to invest that much time in it.I thought it was worth it.",3,Finding Meaning While Following the Lost,1197072000,"12 8, 2007",2007,2714,"['could', ""n't"", 'find', 'edition', 'read', 'Sheltering', 'Sky', 'here', '[', ']', 'copy', 'introduction', 'Paul', 'Bowles', 'written', 'year', 'so', 'died', 'introduction', 'less', 'said', 'film', 'version', 'better', 'only', 'other', 'comment', 'film', 'was', 'mock', 'filmmakers', 'trying', 'make', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'look', 'wife', 'Jane', 'sell', 'story', 'thinly-veiled', 'account', 'trip', 'Sahara', 'trip', 'swears', 'never', 'took', 'Jane', '.I', ""'d"", 'seen', 'movie', 'reading', 'book', 'was', 'intrigued', 'story', 'enough', 'read', 'novel', 'Then', 'watched', 'movie', 'again', 'film', 'certainly', 'more', 'interesting', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'probably', 'can', 'follow', 'inner', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'lack', 'feelings', 'characters', 'something', ""'d"", 'only', 'have', 'guess', 'watching', 'film', 'otherwise', 'seemed', 'really', 'good', 'dialogue', 'was', 'left', 'film', 'Port', 'Kit', 'especially', 'final', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'was', 'given', 'author', 'cameo', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'easier', '.I', 'love', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'think', 'not', 'really', 'right', 'Port', 'Port', 'vain', 'handsome', 'empty', 'man', 'stubbornly', 'trying', 'free', 'privileged', 'existence', 'Malkovich', 'too', 'intense', 'interesting', 'too', 'unpredictable', 'be', 'pretty', 'boy', 'foolishly', 'blundering', 'Sahara', 'shake', 'off', 'great', 'actor', 'talents', 'character', 'again', 'opinion', '.And', ""'ve"", 'really', 'learned', 'appreciate', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'really', 'one', 'country', 'finest', 'actresses', 'taking', 'really', 'tough', 'roles', 'making', 'work', 'When', 'left', 'carry', 'movie', 'wished', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'scenes', 'earlier', 'draw', 'character', 'more', 'Three', 'years', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'Shadowlands', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins.The', 'brutality', 'novel', 'downplayed', 'when', 'Kit', 'join', 'caravan', 'late', 'film', 'movie', 'involved', 'Arab', 'trader', 'mini-romance', 'where', 'eventually', 'novel', 'immediately', 'passed', 'two', 'men', 'leading', 'caravan', 'total', 'loss', 'identity', 'think', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'huge', 'difference', 'romance', 'rape', 'right', 'film', 'storyline', 'somewhat', 'faithfully', 'really', 'wonderful', 'photography', 'Sahara', 'Desert', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'little', 'confusing', 'read', 'book', 'rewatched', ""'m"", 'sure', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'did', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'sure', ""'d"", 'want', 'invest', 'much', 'time', 'it.I', 'thought', 'was', 'worth']",N/A
