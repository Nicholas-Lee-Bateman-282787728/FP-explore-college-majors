Needless to say, I was not disappointed.  VERY good mix of old footage that was all new to me, and the best bonus of all in this set was the ""NFL Missing Rings"" story of the 1981 season.  I truly wish that NFL films would do an entire series of all of the Super Bowl teams that DIDN'T win the big one, because their stories seem to be much more compelling than those teams who ultimately attained victory (The 1969 Minnesota Vikings story on the ""Missing Rings"" set is my absolute fave).  Granted, the Chargers didn't make the Super Bowl that year, but what they went through the previous seasons leading up to 1981 is engaging to say the least.  I have always admired Dan Fouts as a QB, but after watching that piece, I really like him as a person now (Especially him telling the story of his hat that read ""MFIC"" . .but you'll have to see the DVD to find out that bit of info, as I won't divulge it in this review) because of the competitive nature of his that came out in that show.If you want to know what the DVD contains after 1990, you'll have to read some of the other submissions, because on my end, I live in the past with regards to the NFL.  So anything I say regarding that would definitely have a negative slant to it. But if you're looking for great 60's, 70's & 80's footage from the Chargers, you may want to buy this.",5,"Well worth the price for the 60's, 70's & 80's footage alone.",1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,1476,"['Myself', 'bought', 'DVD', 'hoping', 'would', ""n't"", 'contain', 'footage', 'had', 'seen', 'old', 'VHS', 'tape', 'Legend', 'Lightning', 'Bolt', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'VERY', 'good', 'mix', 'old', 'footage', 'was', 'new', 'best', 'bonus', 'set', 'was', 'NFL', 'Missing', 'Rings', 'story', '1981', 'season', 'truly', 'wish', 'NFL', 'films', 'would', 'do', 'entire', 'series', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'teams', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'win', 'big', 'one', 'stories', 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'teams', 'who', 'ultimately', 'attained', 'victory', '1969', 'Minnesota', 'Vikings', 'story', 'Missing', 'Rings', 'set', 'absolute', 'fave', 'Granted', 'Chargers', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'year', 'what', 'went', 'previous', 'seasons', 'leading', 'up', '1981', 'engaging', 'say', 'least', 'have', 'always', 'admired', 'Dan', 'Fouts', 'QB', 'watching', 'piece', 'really', 'like', 'person', 'now', 'Especially', 'telling', 'story', 'hat', 'read', 'MFIC', '.but', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'DVD', 'find', 'out', 'bit', 'info', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divulge', 'review', 'competitive', 'nature', 'came', 'out', 'show.If', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'DVD', 'contains', '1990', ""'ll"", 'have', 'read', 'other', 'submissions', 'end', 'live', 'past', 'regards', 'NFL', 'anything', 'say', 'regarding', 'would', 'definitely', 'have', 'negative', 'slant', ""'re"", 'looking', 'great', '60', '70', '80', 'footage', 'Chargers', 'may', 'want', 'buy']",NFL: History of the San Diego Chargers

With the departure of Cromartie, LT, and Merriman, the Chargers are in a new era and this DVD will probably need to be redone within the next couple of years to remain relevant. I still thoroughly enjoyed some of the old football clips. I haven't gotten through the second DVD yet, but look forward to it.",4,"Great history lesson, but it is already becoming outdated",1310688000,"07 15, 2011",2011,445,"['great', 'history', 'lesson', 'young', 'Chargers', 'fan', 'learn', 'Chargers', 'teams', 'past', 'already', 'becoming', 'outdated', 'departure', 'Cromartie', 'LT', 'Merriman', 'Chargers', 'are', 'new', 'era', 'DVD', 'will', 'probably', 'need', 'be', 'redone', 'next', 'couple', 'years', 'remain', 'relevant', 'still', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'old', 'football', 'clips', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'second', 'DVD', 'yet', 'look', 'forward']",NFL: History of the San Diego Chargers

1259049,A2NYP14G06U9WG,B002AS461O,Jay,"[0, 0]","I enjoyed this film immensely. The film covers the history of the Chargers from their beginnings in 1960 until 2009. It thoroughly covers the major players and all the coaches who were involved with the team during that time period. I learned that the name &#34;Chargers&#34; was given to the team by the first team owner who was also the owner of the Hilton hotel chain company. He named them the &#34;chargers&#34; after one who charges transactions on their credit card. I preferred the earlier logo of the horse (a charger), but the lighting bolt symbol (as in an electric bolt or charge) is the best. I think the Chargers have the best looking uniforms in the NFL. They have had many talented players over the years, but have yet to win a Super Bowl championship. I'd like to see them do that and look good doing it in their good looking powder blue, yellow, and white uniforms.",5,This is a very good pictorial history of the Chargers,1395619200,"03 24, 2014",2014,883,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'immensely', 'film', 'history', 'Chargers', 'beginnings', '1960', '2009', 'major', 'players', 'coaches', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'team', 'time', 'period', 'learned', 'name', '34', 'Chargers', '34', 'was', 'given', 'team', 'first', 'team', 'owner', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'owner', 'Hilton', 'hotel', 'chain', 'company', 'named', '34', 'chargers', '34', 'one', 'who', 'transactions', 'credit', 'card', 'preferred', 'earlier', 'logo', 'horse', 'charger', 'lighting', 'bolt', 'symbol', 'electric', 'bolt', 'charge', 'best', 'think', 'Chargers', 'have', 'best', 'looking', 'uniforms', 'NFL', 'have', 'had', 'many', 'talented', 'players', 'years', 'have', 'yet', 'win', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'championship', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'do', 'look', 'good', 'doing', 'good', 'looking', 'powder', 'blue', 'yellow', 'white', 'uniforms']",NFL: History of the San Diego Chargers
