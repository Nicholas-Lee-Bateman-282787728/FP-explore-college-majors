He's dating the owner's (Dennis Farina) daughter, Elaine Warner (Leslie Mann), and they are planning on getting married.  They had decided to wait to get married until they had saved up enough to put a down payment on a house.  The movie begins with them realizing that they have finally saved up enough money.  There's just one problem, John promised his niece, Noreen Plummer (Tammy Blanchard), that if she got in to college he would pay for it.  Well, she got into Harvard and now she needs the money - the exact amount that he had saved up.  John is stuck with a decision but can't take away his wife's dreams, so he turns to an old friend to help him come up with the money, Walter 'Duff' Duffy (Tom Green (III)).  Duff comes up with several illegal plans for getting the money, each getting them further into trouble with the law.  Eventually all of the plans catch up to them and they have to deal with the chaos they have been causing and they still don't have the money.My Comments:The movie was occasionally funny, but only occasionally.  The plot was pretty good and the story wasn't terrible, but it wasn't really memorable.  The major problem with the movie was that it was supposed to be funny, but it wasn't.  Jason Lee tries, and some of the situations are a bit humorous - specifically the repeated instances of the main characters having to dress up as women for the Honorable Emmett Cook (Richard Jenkins (I)) - but the best it does is get an occasional chuckle.This movie seemed to receive a lot of hype, and, frankly, I thought it was going to be more about actually going to college.  But college and college life really have very little to do with it.Overall, this movie didn't live up to the hype it received.  It may be kind of funny if you're really bored and need something to do on a Friday night with friends.

Jason Lee is funnier in films directed by Kevin Smith, but I really expected more since this film was directed by Bruce McCullouch of Kids in the Hall fame.

732211,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00007M5KK,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 2]","I bought this movie without ever seeing it because based on the trailer it looked hilarious.  At the time Tom Green was the `it' comedian; his MTV show being huge and his high profile persona taking off (he married the amazingly talented and beautiful Drew Barrymore), so it was obvious that his named attached to a comedy would bring in a decent crowd.  Sadly, `Stealing Harvard' wastes the talent he does have.  Green possesses a very distinct kind of comedic talent that needs to be channeled properly to really work, and while he does have the funniest scenes in the film, he never really finds his footing here.The story is farfetched.  John Plummer hates his job and his fianc&eacute;s father, whom he happens to work for.  He and his fianc&eacute; have been saving their money in order to put a down payment on a house and get married and they finally have enough; $30,000.  It just so happens that John promised his niece that he would pay for her schooling if she went to college and she just got accepted to Harvard; she just needs $30,000.  Jon doesn't want to disappoint his fianc&eacute; so he gets his idiot friend Duff to help him try and steal the money.This of course leads to attempts at humor that often miss the mark.Jason Lee is not my favorite actor.  I just have yet to really see him do something I enjoy.  I actually liked `Alvin and the Chipmunks' but that's another story.  Dennis Farina is pathetic here, as is Leslie Mann, who has some preposterous character development.  John C. McGinley is decent, but then again he is always the same.  Megan Mullally is funny, but underused.  I actually think the funniest supporting performance belongs to Martin Starr who plays the clerk at the liquor store John and Duff try and rob (probably the funniest scene in the film).  Tom Green delivers his lines well and serves up some humor, but like I mentioned, the film wastes him.In the end I can't say that this is a film I'll watch regularly.  I've owned it for six years now and I've seen it twice (when I first bought it and then last night) and I don't plan on popping it back in the DVD tray for another six years or so.

At least, according to my tastes (which may or may not stink, hehe).It's about a man who makes a promise to his distraught niece after she fails a spelling bee that, if she were to ever make it into college, he'd pay for it.  Well skip ahead several years later and, to his absolute surprise she DOES end up going to college, and to Harvard of all places!It turns out she needs 30,000 bucks.  From here the storyline kicks in, and to me, it's a really funny movie that never fails with the laughs.  Of course you could argue that once the guys nerdy friend enters the picture to help with the money situation, the humor goes down significantly (because he is fairly annoying, to be honest).  He's kind of obnoxious most of the time.However the incredible twist of horrible luck (and humorous segments) the poor guy has to endure just to come up with 30 grand is quite the spectacle to watch.  Despite being a comedy you can't help but feel sorry for the guy.  Without spoiling anything, he has to put up with utter crappiness at every single turn it seems.I mean, just think about this- his girlfriends father hates his guts, the police department gradually catch on to his sneaky ways, and his girlfriend is always questioning his every move.  Somehow, for the sake of his nieces future, he has to find ways to avoid *everybody* and focus on obtaining the money.Overall, it's a really good movie.  The humor and storytelling are both really well-written which is a rare find these days.

I thought the movie would have a good amount of gross out humor in it such Tom Green was in this.

Unforunately for John, his comments were videotaped and his niece got accepted into Harvard.  He needed about 30,000.  The money he had was going into a new home for he and his wife.  John was going to many people for help, but the only person who tries to help him is Duff.  However, Duff gets him in deeper water than he could ever imagine.  In Duff's ideas, John gets shot at, spoons with a judge that ends up getting him out of trouble in the end of the movie, and has a criminal record that doom a person for life.  I believe that John got to steal some money from his wife's dad to pay for the tuition.  The scenes that I thought were funny was when they tried to rob the liquor store with toy guns that were spray painted to look like real ones, the worker ended up having a real gun and made them drop the money and guns, but the gun was stuck to john's hand.

732216,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00007M5KK,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[1, 3]","Comedy is hard.  Just ask the people who made Stealing Harvard (2002).  Directed by Kids in the Hall alum Bruce McCulloch, starring Jason Lee and Tom Green, Stealing Harvard provides some (some, meaning not nearly enough) funny and charming moments, but really not enough to carry the film.  At the time of writing this review, there are over 100 used copies for sale here, and the lowest price is under a couple of bucks.  That should tell you something...Anyway, the film is about a character named John Plummer (Lee) and an off the cuff promise he made to his college bound niece when she was younger, a promise that just happened to be caught on video tape, and one where he told her that if she ever got into college, he would pay for it...well, it's many years later, and she does get into college, Harvard, in fact, and now she needs $30,000 to make up what isn't covered by herself and her scholarships.  John does have the money, but problem is, it's earmarked for him and his fianc&eacute;e Elaine, played by Leslie Mann, to buy a home and get married.  In an effort to find another way to come up with the money, John turns to his friend Walter P. `Duff' Duffy (Green), a half-wit with a penchant for coming up with plenty of schemes to obtain the money, most being highly illegal.So what's wrong with the movie?  I guess the main thing is it just wasn't that funny.  I do like Jason Lee and I even think Tom Green is pretty funny, in the context of his MTV show, but the comedy is very sparse throughout the film, and I never really felt like the main characters ever really gelled.  I actually found some of the supporting characters in Dennis Farina (John's boss and future father-in-law), Megan Mullally (John's sister and mother of his niece), John C. McGinley (the intense bald-headed police detective), and Seymour Cassel (Duffy's uncle who provides the boys with one of their many plans to get the money) to be funnier and more interesting to watch than the main characters.  Lee and Green just never really clicked full on for me.  I had read that Owen Wilson was originally wanted for Green's part, and I think that would have worked better, as it seemed pretty obvious that a lot of Green's screen antics were probably improvised, and in small doses can be funny, but not in the large volumes we are given here.  Had the comedy been more persuasive throughout the film, I probably wouldn't have had time to dwell on whether or not the characters worked well together.  As I said before, I do think Tom Green is pretty funny, at least he was on his MTV show, and in small doses, but here we just get too much of him, and his weird, flaky, in-your-face schtick drags on and gets old fast.  If you want a much better example of this and/or you're a real glutton for punishment, go pick up his 2001 release of Freddie Got Fingered.  Am I saying Tom Green ruined the movie?  Nope, as I felt there just wasn't really that much of a movie to ruin.  I say ruined, but the movie wasn't really that bad, but I would have a hard time recommending anyone run out and see it, or even rent it, for that matter, as even though the film ran a paltry 82 minutes, it's few truly comic moments do not add up to a funny movie.The wide screen print here looks very good, and special features include deleted scenes (although I could not tell why they were deleted as they would have fleshed out the runtime and even added a bit more to the storyline, but whatever...), filmographies, and trailers for various Paramount releases.  All in all, if you are looking to kill an hour and twenty minutes, or you're a die-hard Tom Green fan, then this film is for you.Cookieman108",3,"""I was hungry so I decided to heat up a brick of cheese.""",1090108800,"07 18, 2004",2004,3672,"['Comedy', 'hard', 'Just', 'ask', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'Stealing', 'Harvard', '2002', 'Directed', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'alum', 'Bruce', 'McCulloch', 'starring', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Tom', 'Green', 'Stealing', 'Harvard', 'meaning', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'funny', 'charming', 'moments', 'really', 'not', 'enough', 'carry', 'film', 'time', 'writing', 'review', 'are', '100', 'used', 'copies', 'sale', 'here', 'lowest', 'price', 'couple', 'bucks', 'should', 'tell', 'something', 'Anyway', 'film', 'character', 'named', 'John', 'Plummer', 'Lee', 'off', 'cuff', 'promise', 'made', 'college', 'bound', 'niece', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'promise', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'caught', 'video', 'tape', 'one', 'where', 'told', 'ever', 'got', 'college', 'would', 'pay', 'well', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'get', 'college', 'Harvard', 'fact', 'now', '30,000', 'make', 'up', 'what', ""n't"", 'covered', 'scholarships', 'John', 'have', 'money', 'problem', 'earmarked', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Elaine', 'played', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'buy', 'home', 'get', 'married', 'effort', 'find', 'way', 'come', 'up', 'money', 'John', 'friend', 'Walter', 'P.', 'Duff', 'Duffy', 'Green', 'half-wit', 'penchant', 'coming', 'up', 'plenty', 'schemes', 'obtain', 'money', 'most', 'being', 'highly', 'illegal.So', 'what', 'wrong', 'movie', 'guess', 'main', 'thing', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'do', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'even', 'think', 'Tom', 'Green', 'pretty', 'funny', 'context', 'MTV', 'show', 'comedy', 'very', 'sparse', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'main', 'characters', 'ever', 'really', 'gelled', 'actually', 'found', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Dennis', 'Farina', 'John', 'boss', 'future', 'father-in-law', 'Megan', 'Mullally', 'John', 'sister', 'mother', 'niece', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'intense', 'bald-headed', 'police', 'detective', 'Seymour', 'Cassel', 'Duffy', 'uncle', 'who', 'boys', 'one', 'many', 'plans', 'get', 'money', 'be', 'funnier', 'more', 'interesting', 'watch', 'main', 'characters', 'Lee', 'Green', 'just', 'never', 'really', 'clicked', 'full', 'had', 'read', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'was', 'originally', 'wanted', 'Green', 'part', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'lot', 'Green', 'screen', 'antics', 'were', 'probably', 'improvised', 'small', 'doses', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'not', 'large', 'volumes', 'are', 'given', 'here', 'Had', 'comedy', 'been', 'more', 'persuasive', 'film', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'time', 'dwell', 'not', 'characters', 'worked', 'well', 'together', 'said', 'do', 'think', 'Tom', 'Green', 'pretty', 'funny', 'least', 'was', 'MTV', 'show', 'small', 'doses', 'here', 'just', 'get', 'too', 'much', 'weird', 'flaky', 'in-your-face', 'schtick', 'drags', 'old', 'fast', 'want', 'much', 'better', 'example', 'and/or', ""'re"", 'real', 'glutton', 'punishment', 'go', 'pick', 'up', '2001', 'release', 'Freddie', 'Got', 'Fingered', 'Am', 'saying', 'Tom', 'Green', 'ruined', 'movie', 'Nope', 'felt', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'much', 'movie', 'ruin', 'say', 'ruined', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'would', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'recommending', 'anyone', 'run', 'out', 'see', 'even', 'rent', 'matter', 'even', 'film', 'ran', 'paltry', '82', 'minutes', 'few', 'truly', 'comic', 'moments', 'do', 'not', 'add', 'up', 'funny', 'movie.The', 'wide', 'screen', 'print', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'could', 'not', 'tell', 'why', 'were', 'deleted', 'would', 'have', 'fleshed', 'out', 'runtime', 'even', 'added', 'bit', 'more', 'storyline', 'filmographies', 'trailers', 'various', 'Paramount', 'releases', 'are', 'looking', 'kill', 'hour', 'twenty', 'minutes', ""'re"", 'die-hard', 'Tom', 'Green', 'fan', 'then', 'film', 'you.Cookieman108']",N/A

So now Duff (Tom Green) goes on various lawless tactics to acquire money to send her to Harvard. This plot idea is really good but whatever could've put it to good use is completely wasted on bad acting by almost everyone involved. To be honest, I walked out of the room after about 40 minutes because nothing came up that was funny or the slightest bit interesting enough to keep me from going up to my room and resume on homework assignments.This movie is nowhere near as hideously awful like ""Freddy Got Fingered"" was but ""Stealing Harvard"" could really have been a great or at least halfway-decent movie but the cast's acting was just lame and unconvincing and completely sank the film to mediocrity in every way you can look at it.There was a reason why almost everyone bashed this movie to pieces.

At times he can be a little much, but that is why Stealing Harvard is a great place to watch Tom Green. Tom Green plays the supporting character to Jason Lee, who plays a character that is definitely a precursor to his great My Name Is Earl character. Together on screen they are fun, and interesting.

Bernabo,"[2, 4]","I did like the &quot;Branch Rickey&quot; joke, but I bet that gag was over the head of a lot of people who checked out &quot;Stealing Harvard.&quot; Besides, that joke was in the trailer as were most of what ends up being the funny parts from this 2002 comedy. Please, raise your hand if you are sick and tired of trailers usually being better than the movies they trick you into going to see. If this movie did not have a trailer to give away the good parts I could have given it another star.The story that Peter Tolan and Martin Hynes come up with provides a good enough framework for a comedy. John Plummer (Jason Lee) and his fiance, Elaine Warner (Leslie Mann) have finally saved $30,000, which is enough for them to buy a home and get married. But John's neice Noreen (Tammy Blanchard) has just achieved her dream of being accepted at Harvard and she and her mother, Patty (Megan Mullally) have a videotape from many years earlier when Uncle John promised to pay for Noreen's college education. Noreen only needs $29 thousand and change in eleven days. John cannot just give Noreen the $30,000 that is earmarked for the new house and the only reasonable alternative, as suggested by his best friend &quot;Duff&quot; (Tom Green), is to steal the money.This is easier said then done, an idea that could be handled creatively but is not in this film. Instead we have something on the level of &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; if written by high school students who only remember the worst episodes of &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; This movie is just not funny and most of the cast is clearly trying too hard. A film in which Tom Green and Jason Lee are both too sedate is not a good sign. Richard Jenkins plays the only character who seems comfortable with their role, but I do want to mention that in the last act of the film Leslie Mann's Elaine suddenly turns out to be a bit more than a woman who tends to cry during sex, which was a pleasing surprise.The plot has its standard complications. Elaine is the boss's daughter and daddy (Dennis Farina) makes a point of asking each day if John is sleeping with his little girl and is looking for someway to break up the couple, aided in his effort by Rex the Dog (Zeus). Meanwhile, John and Duff have to contend with both Detective Charles (John C. McGinley) and local thug David Loach (Chirs Penn) as they try to figure out a way of &quot;Stealing Harvard.&quot; But you keep coming back to the idea that certainly Green and Lee could have come up with better ad libs that what ends up in this lame little comedy.The working titles for this film included &quot;The Promise,&quot; &quot;You Promised,&quot; &quot;Say Uncle,&quot; &quot;Uncle,&quot; and &quot;Stealing Standford.&quot; If you check out the deleted scenes there is a point where Noreen wants to go to &quot;Northern,&quot; so that last one makes me wonder how hard it would have to do regional versions of this film: Harvard for the East and Stanford for the West, then something like Notre Dame or Illinois for the Midwest and Duke or Miami for the South.

732225,A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,B00007M5KK,"Mike London ""MAC""","[1, 2]","Tom Green and Jason Lee have teamed for this comedy.  Stealing Harvard introduces us to Jason Lee, who quickly learns that Harvard has accepted her.  A long time ago he promised her that he would pay.  The only problem, though, is his girlfriend and he had been saving to buy a house.  His niece needs thirty thousand dollars, which is exactly what they had to saved.  Instead of telling his girlfriend, Jason Lee struggles to find other ways of raising the money.  When he finally does get the nerve, it is too late; she has already put in a bid on a house, thereby locking up the funds.  The bid goes through.Tom Green suggests to Jason Lee they could steal the money.  The rest of the film is about how they bungle through various burglary jobs, trying to get the money.  Each job gets more and more botched.  The very first job is probably the funniest, because Jason Lee breaks into a house and is intercepted by the owner who is both very off in the head and very lonely for his dead wife.While the film certainly has its funny moments, it's not one of those movies you can watch over and over again.  For you Tom Green fans, there's his usual antics which should keep you satisfied.  I've never been much of a Tom Green fan personally.  Tom Green's character is certainly funny, and it is through him that Jason Lee gets his jobs.  They never work out as well as Tom Green says they will.Though the film does wander through some funny material, it just feels so formulaic.  If you don't have anything else to do, watch Stealing Harvard.  But if you want to see a good movie, there are certainly better ones out there.  Once the dramatic situation is established, you can pretty much write the rest of the movie yourself.  There are certainly a few laughs, but more oft than not you know exactly where they're going.This results in rather stale movie making, where instead of making a really good comedy they make one more hour and a half diversion to waste your time on.  There is no edge to this film, which you would expect from Jason Lee and Tom Green.  This is a movie more about the pay check than anything else.September 25, 2002-Written as Newspaper review in 2002 while the movie was in theatres (released on Amazon.co.uk in 2007).

Nice guy John (Jason Lee) is planning a wedding with his fiancee Elaine (whose father is not so nice Dennis Farina ... who does not lose any chances to tease his would-be son-in-law).  But now, the couple have gained enough money to buy a house so that they can start a new life.  John is very happy until the day he learns that his niece passed the entrance exam for Harvard, and reminds him of the old promise he made to her -- if she is going to university, HE will pay the money for her!How contrived it is ... but that is just the start of the film, and we haven't seen Tom Green yet.  Because of this new trouble, John has to sacrifice his belief in honesty, or his engagement with Elaine.  So, John asks a piece of advice from the most unlikely person you can imagine -- yes, Duff, played by Tom Green, who thinks of outrageous plans for raising the money of 30,000 dallars.  And you see, his plans are all unusual.The problem is twofold; one is its too tame gags used here.  Think of Tom Green, and you remember (if you saw it) the nightmare of ""Freddy Got Fingered.""  But at least, the gags of that film were memorable in more than one meaning.  Yes, they were ultimate bad tastes, like abusing many poor animals or flinging a baby, but that kind of things that would stick to your memory.  In ""Stealing"" there are few instances of his craziness.  It looks as if he is restraining himself, and everything in this film is simply unmemorable.The other problem is that the characters look very mean and nasty.  Think about it, please; if you promised something like John did to his niece, would you really demand that the promise should be kept many years later?  Do you when it's done long time ago and when you were just a kid?  Or, would you really love somebody who insists on getting the money first before marriage, and always refuses any (decent) requests the guy is making to her?  Or, first of all, even if you're in trouble, would you go to Tom Green?I know it's a comedy, but even mindless comedies need basic plot that might engage our attention.

And overall it's a pretty good film.  One other review read &quot; not quite 'Road Trip', not quite 'Mallrats'.  And that's very true.  But both of those movies were so original and popular that it's hard to compare 'Stealing Harvard', or any movie for that matter, to either of them.  This movie is very good, and if you enjoy good slapstick comedy, you'll certainly enjoy it.The story is about a regular John (Jason Lee) who once promised his niece he'd pay for college once she was old enough to go.  But, as you can imagine, he forgets about his promise; then once the subject is brought back to him he's broke.  Although the beginning is a bit slow, the comedy really picks up when Tom Green is introduced.  He plays the part of the bungling Duff, a character that's a little more well-rounded than his part in 'Road Trip'.  I don't like to give away what happens in movies, so I'll leave it at that.  You can probably predict the ending, but then again, when can't you?Jason Lee and Tom Green make an unlikely, but good, duo.  I give the director Bruce McCulloch a lot of credit for doing what he did with a semi-off script.  But he does manage to throw in some great appearances, including the infamous Chris Penn of 'Reservoir Dogs', Dennis Farina, and Leslie Mann (of 'Big Daddy').  All in all it's a very funny movie; one you shouldn't overlook.  The acting is mostly above average, but Jason Lee's performance was certainly the highlight of the movie.
