Having said that, it's also worth mentioning that the storyline is hardly Michael Chabon's and why the changes were made (from the book) is unclear, however, as a stand-alone it seems to work (if you ignore that it's a novel adaptation and think of it as a standalone film). It's no the most engaging movie nor is it the worst movie ever. If you haven't read the book or don't mind watching the movie and can refrain from comparing it to the book, there's a good chance that you'll like it.",3,don't expect the film to follow the book and you'll enjoy watching it,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,561,"['beginning', 'viewer', 'movies', 'decent', 'story', 'Having', 'said', 'also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'storyline', 'hardly', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 'why', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'book', 'unclear', 'however', 'stand-alone', 'work', 'ignore', 'novel', 'adaptation', 'think', 'standalone', 'film', 'most', 'engaging', 'movie', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'refrain', 'comparing', 'book', 'good', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'like']",N/A

1250771,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0025XUTJW,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","My biggest problem with the Mysteries of Pittsburgh is that the description is *nothing* like I had hoped.  It's misleading, in fact.  The description says action/adventure.  What?  Consider the name of the film and then the ""action/adventure"" tag and well, this ain't exactly an adventure now, is it?Well, what we get instead is... a storyline about a young man who has a pesky old man for a father constantly questioning what he's going to do with his life.  ""You can't spend your entire summer being a lazy bum and hanging out with thugs!""  That's basically what his father says.  He never gives the poor kid a break.  He's also connected to the mob so his son always chooses his words carefully, and fearful that he might upset his father.  They only meet up at restaurants to chit chat and never anywhere else.  Well, until later.The young man has problems of his own.  He's having frequent sex with his workmate/girlfriend at a bookstore.  Eventually he grows tired of her when he discovers a REALLY attractive blonde at a party.  From there, the REAL story kicks in.Now it's about the young man having a huge crush on the blonde girl, but unfortunately for him she has a boyfriend.  Isn't that always how it is?  Yes, it's *always* like that, in both real life and the movies!Well, the interesting thing about this storyline is that the young man develops a friendship with the blonde AND her boyfriend, and many times all three of them hang out together.  Interesting.  Of course there's a crucial storyline twist later on (actually make that TWO twists) that's quite surprising to me, but like always, I refuse to give away unnecessary spoilers.  Sorry!Overall, it's alright.  I feel there wasn't quite enough suspense or storyline direction to warrant a purchase of a film that's only above average at best, however you can go ahead and rent the Mysteries of Pittsburgh as part of a one-time viewing.  It's good enough for that.",4,no real mystery,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,1938,"['biggest', 'problem', 'Mysteries', 'Pittsburgh', 'description', 'had', 'hoped', 'misleading', 'fact', 'description', 'action/adventure', 'What', 'Consider', 'name', 'film', 'then', 'action/adventure', 'tag', 'well', 'ai', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'adventure', 'now', 'Well', 'what', 'get', 'instead', 'storyline', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'pesky', 'old', 'man', 'father', 'constantly', 'questioning', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'spend', 'entire', 'summer', 'being', 'lazy', 'bum', 'hanging', 'out', 'thugs', 'basically', 'what', 'father', 'never', 'poor', 'kid', 'break', 'also', 'connected', 'mob', 'son', 'always', 'words', 'carefully', 'fearful', 'might', 'upset', 'father', 'only', 'meet', 'up', 'restaurants', 'chit', 'chat', 'never', 'anywhere', 'else', 'Well', 'later.The', 'young', 'man', 'problems', 'own', 'having', 'frequent', 'sex', 'workmate/girlfriend', 'bookstore', 'Eventually', 'tired', 'when', 'REALLY', 'attractive', 'blonde', 'party', 'there', 'REAL', 'story', 'kicks', 'in.Now', 'young', 'man', 'having', 'huge', 'crush', 'blonde', 'girl', 'unfortunately', 'boyfriend', ""n't"", 'always', 'how', 'Yes', 'real', 'life', 'movies', 'Well', 'interesting', 'thing', 'storyline', 'young', 'man', 'friendship', 'blonde', 'boyfriend', 'many', 'times', 'three', 'hang', 'out', 'together', 'Interesting', 'course', 'crucial', 'storyline', 'twist', 'later', 'actually', 'make', 'TWO', 'twists', 'quite', 'surprising', 'always', 'refuse', 'give', 'away', 'unnecessary', 'spoilers', 'Sorry', 'Overall', 'alright', 'feel', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'enough', 'suspense', 'storyline', 'direction', 'warrant', 'purchase', 'film', 'only', 'above', 'average', 'best', 'however', 'can', 'go', 'ahead', 'rent', 'Mysteries', 'Pittsburgh', 'part', 'one-time', 'viewing', 'good', 'enough']",N/A

1250773,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0025XUTJW,Grady Harp,"[21, 21]","For those who find it difficult to appreciate the adaptation format of film making from a famous novel, THE MYSTERIES OF PITTSBURGH as now released on DVD should help explain the naysayers' opinions.  In a very valuable session of conversations among Michael Chabon and Rawson Marshall Thurber (screenwriter and director) and the producer and cast, the transition of this complex novel into a very altered story is comfortably explained and the person most happy with the result seems to be the originator - Michael Chabon!That being said  this film stands well on its own terms. June and July in hot Pittsburgh generate mysteries among a variety of people, especially the young college graduate Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) who while working in a bookstore wastes time with a fling with the supervisor Phlox (Mena Suvari) with disinterested post grad classes dealing with becoming a broker and having monthly dinners with his mobster father Joe Bechstein (Nick Nolte), until he encounters an odd couple: bisexual biker and thief Cleveland (Peter Sarsgaard) and his female consort, the violinist Jane Bellwether (Sienna Miller).  The bizarre interactions among these characters drive Art to make many decisions and discoveries - including his falling in love with both Cleveland and Jane.  The summer winds down with Art finally discovering his own identity despite the clouds of mystery that have surrounded his life.  It is a piece of life as lived by disparate characters whose direction in life seems at odds with the natural flow of finding happiness and success.  But then the question is asked - what is happiness and what is success if not survival?For this viewer the explanation by the makers of this film was interesting enough to encourage a repeat watching of the movie. A good movie not a great movie, but it still tastes strongly of Michael Chabon's genius.  It deserves more attention than the critics have given it.....Grady Harp, August 09",4,Watch the Commentary Between Chabon and Thurber FIRST,1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,1955,"['who', 'find', 'difficult', 'appreciate', 'adaptation', 'format', 'film', 'making', 'famous', 'novel', 'THE', 'MYSTERIES', 'OF', 'PITTSBURGH', 'now', 'released', 'DVD', 'should', 'help', 'explain', 'naysayers', 'opinions', 'very', 'valuable', 'session', 'conversations', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 'Rawson', 'Marshall', 'Thurber', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'producer', 'cast', 'transition', 'complex', 'novel', 'very', 'altered', 'story', 'comfortably', 'explained', 'person', 'most', 'happy', 'result', 'be', 'originator', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'well', 'own', 'terms', 'June', 'July', 'hot', 'Pittsburgh', 'generate', 'mysteries', 'variety', 'people', 'especially', 'young', 'college', 'graduate', 'Art', 'Bechstein', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'who', 'working', 'bookstore', 'time', 'fling', 'supervisor', 'Phlox', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'disinterested', 'post', 'grad', 'classes', 'dealing', 'becoming', 'broker', 'having', 'monthly', 'dinners', 'mobster', 'father', 'Joe', 'Bechstein', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'odd', 'couple', 'bisexual', 'biker', 'thief', 'Cleveland', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'female', 'consort', 'violinist', 'Jane', 'Bellwether', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'bizarre', 'interactions', 'characters', 'drive', 'Art', 'make', 'many', 'decisions', 'discoveries', 'including', 'falling', 'love', 'Cleveland', 'Jane', 'summer', 'down', 'Art', 'finally', 'discovering', 'own', 'identity', 'clouds', 'mystery', 'have', 'surrounded', 'life', 'piece', 'life', 'lived', 'disparate', 'characters', 'direction', 'life', 'odds', 'natural', 'flow', 'finding', 'happiness', 'success', 'then', 'question', 'asked', 'what', 'happiness', 'what', 'success', 'not', 'survival', 'viewer', 'explanation', 'makers', 'film', 'was', 'interesting', 'enough', 'encourage', 'repeat', 'watching', 'movie', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'still', 'strongly', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 'genius', 'more', 'attention', 'critics', 'have', 'given', '..Grady', 'Harp', 'August', '09']",N/A

His dad (Nick Nolte) is a crime boss who has a job lined up for Art who lacks assertiveness. Phlox (Mena Suvari) is his boss and sex partner at the Book Barn.

She also has a boyfriend, Cleveland (Peter Sarsgaard) &#34;like the state&#34; who we soon find out is bisexual. The three of them start hanging out together.The first thing you notice is the annoying narration by Art because they couldn't make a decent screen adaptation. The characters of Art and his dad were poorly constructed. When they got together, you just wished the scene would be over. Jane is an interesting character who we never got to know, and Cleveland is a character we perhaps learned too much about. This is a story of Art trying to find himself one summer in Pittsburgh.
