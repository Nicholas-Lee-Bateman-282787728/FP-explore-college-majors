561963,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00004ZBVI,C. O. DeRiemer,"[1, 2]","Something's not right at isolated Fort Humbolt and diphtheria may be the least of the problems. Breakheart Pass is based on the adventure thriller by Alistair MacLean, who also wrote the screenplay. It's not bad as a Bronson vehicle except for its excesses: An obvious 1970s score glued on a movie that's set a century earlier; one action set piece after another, most a lot of fun but so many that the storyline becomes just the excuse for the set pieces; and corny directorial indulgences that have nearly every character in the movie exchanging suspicious glances with one another at key moments, accompanied by music stings.What Breakheart Pass has going for it are some fine character actors like Ben Johnson, Charles Durning and David Huddleston; the look of the film...the hovel of the tiny rail town of Myrtle in the Rockies, dry, gray, worn-out plank buildings, a shack of a train station, a utilitarian brothel that's all business; the tired steam engine and worn carriages but with a plush interior of the wood-paneled dining car and parlor; the rugged snow-covered Sierra Nevada mountains; the stunt work directed by Yakima Canute in his last picture; and, of course, Charles Bronson, phlegmatic, stoic, always watching and seldom speaking. Bronson sure wasn't handsome but he had a memorable, worn and craggy face, even with that Fu Manchu moustache he often wore. He also had the screen presence of a basically tough good man who could do, when aroused, violence that would hurt. Few major movie stars were as unlikely as Bronson.What's the fuss at Fort Humbolt? It has something to do with conspiracy, treachery, rifles and gold...the usual. All we know is that we're on board a train carrying medical supplies and provisions to aid the sick soldiers at the fort. Aboard is the territorial governor, the daughter of the fort's commander, a doctor, a minister, a train official, a major, some of his soldiers and a lawman with his prisoner, a man called Deakin (Charles Bronson). We don't really care, even when the passengers start being murdered. We learn those supplies seem to consist of rifles and ammunition and that Deakin is no bad guy, but this is predictable. All those great stunt set pieces just pile on and make the plot irrelevant. There are fights atop the moving train, the steam engine billows out huge white clouds of steam as it chugs and rattles across a high, rickety wooden bridge, men fall and bounce off that bridge, corpses are discovered in firewood piles, in rifle boxes and in train compartments, Indians rampage and attack, there's a cavalry charge across the snow, a runaway troop car crashes down a mountainside, you name it. Best of all, most of the movie takes place in and around that steam engine, clattering and swaying over the tracks through the mountains. Engine Number 9 should have received star billing alongside Bronson. Just about everyone on the train is suspicious and only Deakin is smart and tough enough to figure things out and then do something about it. With the stunts, with Bronson and with that steam engine, Breakheart Pass could make a great theme park ride.That sentiment holds true of most of Alistair MacLean's books. He was an immensely successful writer of thrillers that featured the same formula: Workmanlike plots, lots of action, little or no sex (it got in the way of the action, MacLean thought) and indestructible heroes. He wrote about 30 thrillers. The last half were nothing but tired exercises in theme park rides. His reputation now probably rests on two movies made from his books, Where Eagles Dare and The Guns of Navarone. For those who enjoy well-written adventure thrillers by authors on their way to being forgotten, try some of the books by Desmond Bagley, James Leasor, Geoffrey Jenkins, and Victor Canning.Breakheart Pass has an okay DVD transfer, with wide screen on one side of the disc and pan-and-scan on the other.

Charles Bronson stars in the lead role as John Deacon, a doctor wanted for murder.  Ben Johnson plays Texas Ranger Nathan Pearce.  Jill Ireland, Bronson's real time wife, stars as the female lead Marsha Scoville.  Richard Crenna plays the secret carrying Governor Fairchild.  Charles Durning portrays the Governor's aid O'Brian.  Ed Lauter plays Sergeant Bellows. Rounding out this cast is the boxer Archie Moore as the company cook.  They all come together for an intrigue filled 200 mile train ride to Fort Humboldt, to deliver much needed medical supplies.  As with all of MacLean's work nothing is as it seems and this is especially true aboard this suspense train.  All the ingredients are there for top notched action and this film delivers the goods.  Bronson's puts in one of his better performances and the rest of the cast sell the story very well.

561975,A276M3NSIY9B82,B00004ZBVI,Harry Brewer,"[3, 4]","Breakheart Pass is a solid western that stars Charles Bronson. The supporting cast is excellent & includes Ben Johnson, Richard Crenna, Jill Ireland (Mrs. Bronson), Charles Durning & Eddie Little Sky. the cast also has two actors, in small roles, better known for being sports personalities: Joe Kapp (former quarterback of the Minnesota Vikings) & Archie Moore (former light-heavyweight world champion boxer). The film was directed by Tom Gries, one of Bronson's two favorite directors. The movie is based on the Alistair MacLean novel of the same name, he also wrote the screenplay. MacLean is famous for writing the novels The Guns of Navarone, Where Eagles Dare & Ice Station Zebra. Breakheart Pass was his only western ; what makes this so unique is MacLean was from Great Britain.Breakheart Pass is actually a Western-mystery. It centers on a train bound for Fort Humboldt where a diptheria epidemic has broke out. The train is carrying medical supplies for the living & coffins for the dead. Leading this expedition is the governor of Colorado, Richard Fairchild (Richard Crenna). He's accompanied by Marcia Scoville (Jill Ireland) with whom he's having a not-so-secret relationship with, she's also the daughter of Col. Scoville, commander of Fort Humboldt. Being the daughter of the commander is the only reason she's on the train because it's restricted to only military personnel or those involved directly with the humanitarian mission. John Deakin (Charles Bronson) is there only because he's an outlaw who's been arrested & the U.S. Deputy Marshall doesn't want to leave him behind. Marshall Nathan Pearce (the venerable Ben Johnson in a rare major role) is on the train because he's supposed to be picking up a civilian prisoner at Fort Humboldt. Major Claremont (Ed Lauter) has a detachment of about 30 or so soldiers on the way to Fort Humboldt as replacements.The outbreak of diptheria at Fort Humboldt isn't common knowledge to everyone on the train. Maj. Claremont isn't told this until they're less than a day away from Fort Humboldt & is told by the Governor this information; & he's only told this because two of his officers had disappeared & been left behind in town. In actuality, they've been murdered & have been stashed in the locomotive's woodpile. The mystery gets deeper as the cars that contain the soldiers are loosened from the train & end uo crashing to death. The locomotive looses its fireman because he fell off the train on a bridge & plummeted to his death.  The doctor dies mysteriously (murdered) & the preacher disappears (murdered).We finally learn that Deakin is an undercover agent for the Secret Service. He's been tracking a stolen shipment of rifles & has found them hidden in the coffins, he's also found dynamite hidden in the so-called cases of medicine. The diptheria outbreak at Fort Humboldt is only a ruse; the guns & dynamite are being delivered there to the not-really captured outlaws & a band of Indians. Before the movie is over we find out almost everyone left alive on the train is part of the conspiracy, including the Governor & the Deputy Marshall. The climax is exciting &well; done. Breakheart Pass is done in the vein of the traditional Western except we can't tell the good guys from the bad guys until near the end.",4,Breakheart Pass,1215302400,"07 6, 2008",2008,3287,"['Breakheart', 'Pass', 'solid', 'western', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'Jill', 'Ireland', 'Mrs.', 'Bronson', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'Eddie', 'Little', 'Sky', 'cast', 'also', 'two', 'actors', 'small', 'roles', 'better', 'known', 'being', 'sports', 'personalities', 'Joe', 'Kapp', 'former', 'quarterback', 'Minnesota', 'Vikings', 'Archie', 'Moore', 'former', 'light-heavyweight', 'world', 'champion', 'boxer', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Tom', 'Gries', 'one', 'Bronson', 'two', 'favorite', 'directors', 'movie', 'based', 'Alistair', 'MacLean', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'MacLean', 'famous', 'writing', 'novels', 'Guns', 'Navarone', 'Where', 'Eagles', 'Dare', 'Ice', 'Station', 'Zebra', 'Breakheart', 'Pass', 'was', 'only', 'western', 'what', 'so', 'unique', 'MacLean', 'was', 'Great', 'Britain.Breakheart', 'Pass', 'actually', 'Western-mystery', 'train', 'bound', 'Fort', 'Humboldt', 'where', 'diptheria', 'epidemic', 'broke', 'out', 'train', 'carrying', 'medical', 'supplies', 'living', 'coffins', 'dead', 'Leading', 'expedition', 'governor', 'Colorado', 'Richard', 'Fairchild', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'accompanied', 'Marcia', 'Scoville', 'Jill', 'Ireland', 'whom', 'having', 'not-so-secret', 'relationship', 'also', 'daughter', 'Col.', 'Scoville', 'commander', 'Fort', 'Humboldt', 'Being', 'daughter', 'commander', 'only', 'reason', 'train', 'restricted', 'only', 'military', 'personnel', 'involved', 'directly', 'humanitarian', 'mission', 'John', 'Deakin', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'only', 'outlaw', 'who', 'been', 'arrested', 'U.S.', 'Deputy', 'Marshall', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', 'behind', 'Marshall', 'Nathan', 'Pearce', 'venerable', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'rare', 'major', 'role', 'train', 'supposed', 'be', 'picking', 'up', 'civilian', 'prisoner', 'Fort', 'Humboldt', 'Major', 'Claremont', 'Ed', 'Lauter', 'detachment', '30', 'so', 'soldiers', 'way', 'Fort', 'Humboldt', 'replacements.The', 'outbreak', 'diptheria', 'Fort', 'Humboldt', ""n't"", 'common', 'knowledge', 'everyone', 'train', 'Maj.', 'Claremont', ""n't"", 'told', ""'re"", 'less', 'day', 'away', 'Fort', 'Humboldt', 'told', 'Governor', 'information', 'only', 'told', 'two', 'officers', 'had', 'disappeared', 'been', 'left', 'town', 'actuality', ""'ve"", 'been', 'murdered', 'have', 'been', 'stashed', 'locomotive', 'woodpile', 'mystery', 'deeper', 'cars', 'contain', 'soldiers', 'are', 'loosened', 'train', 'end', 'uo', 'crashing', 'death', 'locomotive', 'fireman', 'fell', 'off', 'train', 'bridge', 'plummeted', 'death', 'doctor', 'mysteriously', 'murdered', 'preacher', 'murdered', '.We', 'finally', 'learn', 'Deakin', 'undercover', 'agent', 'Secret', 'Service', 'been', 'tracking', 'stolen', 'shipment', 'rifles', 'found', 'hidden', 'coffins', 'also', 'found', 'dynamite', 'hidden', 'so-called', 'cases', 'medicine', 'diptheria', 'outbreak', 'Fort', 'Humboldt', 'only', 'ruse', 'guns', 'dynamite', 'are', 'being', 'delivered', 'there', 'not-really', 'captured', 'outlaws', 'band', 'Indians', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'almost', 'everyone', 'left', 'alive', 'train', 'part', 'conspiracy', 'including', 'Governor', 'Deputy', 'Marshall', 'climax', 'exciting', 'well', 'done', 'Breakheart', 'Pass', 'done', 'vein', 'traditional', 'Western', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'end']",N/A
561976,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00004ZBVI,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","So I dig it muchly when the film takes place on a train. And if that same film also crosses over into the whodunit genre, well, so much the better. BREAKHEART PASS, released in 1975, is actually a western mystery, starring Charles Bronson, he of the rugged frame and the tough, careworn features. And, because what's a Bronson flick without lovely Jill Ireland, she shows up, too, looking all nice.Alistair Maclean offers up the screenplay (adapted from his novel), about a train in the Old West conveying replacement troops and medicine to Fort Humboldt, a distant military garrison stricken with diphtheria. The trek is quite a ways, four hundred miles of freeze and isolation. So it's even more harrowing when the passengers begin to be picked off, one by one. ""Trust no one,"" the movie trailer warns ominously, ""and believe half of what you see. Because nothing is as it appears, and nobody is who they seem to be."" But could the surviving passengers' only hope lie in the mysterious prisoner in their midst?A year before, Charles Bronson knocked it out of the park with his blockbuster flickDeath Wish. So the viewing public was high on him when this one was released. BREAKHEART PASS doesn't let his fans down. It's thrilling and suspenseful and culminates with a slam bang finish. This flick isn't your typical, straightforward western; it's got some twists. While the film doesn't quite bowl you over with jaw-dropping reveals, the frequent plot shifts do keep you involved and guessing. Meanwhile, the imposing snowy backdrop of the Rockies lend greatly to a feeling of deadly danger and isolation.While Charles Bronson will never be considered a consummate actor, he does maximize his talents. His biggest strength is that tough persona he's built up for the cinema. He's absolutely ideal for those roles calling for a man of action (but of few words). Having said this, Bronson does play his John Deakin with enough complexity that you're never quite sure what he's up to, although we don't quite buy Deakin's assertions of pacifism, never mind that he's a former university lecturer. Is he trying to unearth a conspiracy, or is he part of it? Honestly, can you be sure he's the good guy?Backed by a reliable bunch of acting veterans (Ben Johnson, Richard Crenna, Charles Durning) and graced by an oft-partnered actress (and wife), Bronson confidently carries the film. Even though 54 years old when this movie debuted, with those lines on his face sinking in ever deeper, dude was still spry and athletic enough to pull off his action sequences. And for a man of action but few words, well, that's almost everything.",4,"""And you must be Mr. Deakin, the murderer.""",1216771200,"07 23, 2008",2008,2628,"['So', 'dig', 'muchly', 'when', 'film', 'place', 'train', 'same', 'film', 'also', 'whodunit', 'genre', 'well', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'BREAKHEART', 'PASS', 'released', '1975', 'actually', 'western', 'mystery', 'starring', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'rugged', 'frame', 'tough', 'careworn', 'features', 'what', 'Bronson', 'flick', 'lovely', 'Jill', 'Ireland', 'up', 'too', 'looking', 'nice.Alistair', 'Maclean', 'up', 'screenplay', 'adapted', 'novel', 'train', 'Old', 'West', 'conveying', 'replacement', 'troops', 'medicine', 'Fort', 'Humboldt', 'distant', 'military', 'garrison', 'stricken', 'diphtheria', 'trek', 'quite', 'ways', 'four', 'hundred', 'miles', 'freeze', 'isolation', 'even', 'more', 'harrowing', 'when', 'passengers', 'begin', 'be', 'picked', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'Trust', 'one', 'movie', 'trailer', 'ominously', 'believe', 'half', 'what', 'see', 'nothing', 'nobody', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'could', 'surviving', 'passengers', 'only', 'hope', 'lie', 'mysterious', 'prisoner', 'midst', 'year', 'before', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'knocked', 'park', 'blockbuster', 'flickDeath', 'Wish', 'viewing', 'public', 'was', 'high', 'when', 'one', 'was', 'released', 'BREAKHEART', 'PASS', ""n't"", 'let', 'fans', 'down', 'thrilling', 'suspenseful', 'slam', 'bang', 'finish', 'flick', ""n't"", 'typical', 'straightforward', 'western', 'got', 'twists', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bowl', 'jaw-dropping', 'reveals', 'frequent', 'plot', 'shifts', 'do', 'keep', 'involved', 'guessing', 'Meanwhile', 'imposing', 'snowy', 'backdrop', 'Rockies', 'lend', 'greatly', 'feeling', 'deadly', 'danger', 'isolation.While', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'considered', 'consummate', 'actor', 'maximize', 'talents', 'biggest', 'strength', 'tough', 'persona', 'built', 'up', 'cinema', 'absolutely', 'ideal', 'roles', 'calling', 'man', 'action', 'few', 'words', 'Having', 'said', 'Bronson', 'play', 'John', 'Deakin', 'enough', 'complexity', ""'re"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'buy', 'Deakin', 'assertions', 'pacifism', 'never', 'mind', 'former', 'university', 'lecturer', 'trying', 'unearth', 'conspiracy', 'part', 'Honestly', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'good', 'guy', 'Backed', 'reliable', 'bunch', 'acting', 'veterans', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'graced', 'oft-partnered', 'actress', 'wife', 'Bronson', 'confidently', 'film', 'Even', '54', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'movie', 'debuted', 'lines', 'face', 'sinking', 'ever', 'deeper', 'dude', 'was', 'still', 'spry', 'athletic', 'enough', 'pull', 'off', 'action', 'sequences', 'man', 'action', 'few', 'words', 'well', 'almost', 'everything']",N/A

561980,AV64Y0L3C45UX,B00004ZBVI,James Blakley,"[1, 1]","Alistair MacLean's &#34;Breakheart Pass&#34; features Charles Bronson as John Deakim: A self-admitted mass murderer who is apprehended by frontier lawman Marshal Pearce. Pearce is anxious to claim the reward for fugitive Deakim, but must travel by train to get it. When it is revealed that the train is carrying soldiers and supplies to replace those lost in an apparent epidemic at the destination Fort Humboldt, the ride becomes fraught with mayhem; and, as the civilian passengers begin to turn up dead, mystery. And, of course, all eyes turn to Deakim as the main suspect.&#34;Breakheart Pass's&#34; main assets are attention to set design, costuming, and filming. The wintertime shots of the western mountains and high plains is especially crisp. The cast of A-list and reliable character actors are well-costumed. And, the interior train sets add to the air of late 19th century authenticity. Also noteworthy is legendary stuntman Yakima Canutt's riveting 2nd unit work (particularly a nerve-racking, train top fight over the titular Breakheart Pass). All this is heightened by a rousing Jerry Goldsmith score.While the movie indulges the eyes and ears, the scripting leaves little to the imagination (which is a surprise, considering that acclaimed author MacLean adapted it from his novel!). The movie's mystery aspect (which consumes the train ride) is ruined by far too many devious looks, confirming nods, and other non-verbal gestures that betray the true perpetrators early on. This leaves no room for red herrings or surprises; so, most of the performances come off as wooden or predictable. The only suspense generated is how the bad guys will get theirs. And, being that action icon Bronson is involved, it is in quite bloody fashion.With more genuine suspense and character development, &#34;Breakheart Pass&#34; could have been a very good Western.

Also being a fan of Alistair MacLean's writings, have the book in my library. As most movie fans could guess, significant differences exit between the story in book form and the story brought to the screen. One item especially, in the book two train cars hold nothing but the cavalry horses later needed, but on the screen horses have no role to play in the action aboard the train.  And that is interesting because Mr. MacLean wrote the screenplay. However, both the book and the movie, each in it's own venue are still very interesting and entertaining. Was Mr. MacLean rewriting his own novel or did they not want to contend with horses while filming? Who can say, but it works out fine either way.A couple standout items for me in this movie:  the muscial score from Jerry Goldsmith helps to heighten the action and acting performances. Another item is the photography, which captures the deep ravines and tall trail tressels, all backdropped by the green trees and scenic views. A very well managed production, a delight for the eyes of the viewer.A mystery set in the west using ole #9 tall stack locomotive is a movie almost anyone can enjoy.

Western veteran Tom Gries provides good direction and keeps things moving at such a fast pace that you  miss most of the gaping holes in MacLean's script.The beautiful snow-bound locales and shots of the train gliding through valleys and over gorges add to the package, and another plus is the stellar cast featuring character actors like Charles Durning, Ed Lauter (one of the most under-rated stars of the 1970s, in my humble opinion), Richard Crenna and Ben Johnson.The film borrows liberally from Hitchcock's ""The Lady Vanishes"" as people keep mysteriously disappearing or getting killed on the train, before it builds up to a nice big shoot out.The print used for the DVD (which is anamorphic) is pretty good and free of noticeable blemishes while sound comes in the form of a plain vanilla two-channel mono track that is surprisingly good, showing up the strengths of Jerry Goldsmith's score.Overall, this one's not a keeper, but it's definitely good for a rental on a rainy afternoon.",3,Good for a rental on a rainy afternoon!!,1108684800,"02 18, 2005",2005,1806,"['Well', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'when', 'take', 'one-third', 'standard', 'Western', 'movie', 'one-third', 'standard', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'action', 'third', 'usual', 'twisted', 'plot', 'Alistair', 'MacLean', 'full', 'sabotage', 'secret', 'agents', 'Breakheart', 'Pass', 'what', 'Made', 'Bronson', 'was', 'still', 'major', 'draw', 'box', 'office', 'action', 'flicks', 'Western', 'twist', 'featuring', 'Bronson', 'mysterious', 'petty', 'criminal', 'put', 'train', 'carrying', 'cargo', 'what', 'be', 'medicines', 'frontier', 'fort', 'grip', 'diphtheria', 'epidemic.And', 'oh', 'yes', 'are', 'obligatory', 'Red', 'Indians', 'very', 'nasty', 'baddies.But', 'based', 'book', 'Alistair', 'MacLean', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'nothing', 'what', 'seems.What', 'do', 'get', 'ripping', 'good', 'adventure', 'yarn', 'pretty', 'hairy', 'action', 'scenes', 'train', 'Western', 'veteran', 'Tom', 'Gries', 'good', 'direction', 'things', 'moving', 'fast', 'pace', 'miss', 'most', 'gaping', 'holes', 'MacLean', 'script.The', 'beautiful', 'snow-bound', 'locales', 'shots', 'train', 'gliding', 'valleys', 'gorges', 'add', 'package', 'plus', 'stellar', 'cast', 'featuring', 'character', 'actors', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'Ed', 'Lauter', 'one', 'most', 'under-rated', 'stars', '1970s', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'Ben', 'Johnson.The', 'film', 'borrows', 'liberally', 'Hitchcock', 'Lady', 'Vanishes', 'people', 'keep', 'mysteriously', 'disappearing', 'getting', 'killed', 'train', 'up', 'nice', 'big', 'shoot', 'out.The', 'print', 'used', 'DVD', 'anamorphic', 'pretty', 'good', 'free', 'noticeable', 'blemishes', 'sound', 'form', 'plain', 'vanilla', 'two-channel', 'mono', 'track', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'showing', 'up', 'strengths', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'score.Overall', 'one', 'not', 'keeper', 'definitely', 'good', 'rental', 'rainy', 'afternoon']",N/A

Sadly, it took me quite a while to watch this film until the other day.  I have to say that I was very impressed.  I for one love Mr. Bronson's vigilant films and ""Breakheart Pass"" isn't a gritty urban revenge film, but isn't a total departure from the Charlie we all know and love.As for the rest of the cast, ""Breakheart Pass"" had Richard Crenna, Ed Lauter (who was also in Death Wish 3), Charles Durning and Jill Ireland (Bronson's wife and in many of his other films).  Ultimately, the acting in this movie was really good.The premise of the movie is rather simple; a train is bringing medical supplies to an area that is infested with disease.  On this locomotive are a Governor and other high status individuals whose mission is to bring these medical supplies to aid the land and replace the soldiers who fell to the disease.Now you might be wondering where good old Charlie fits in, well he plays a (somewhat) scoundrel who is wanted by law enforcement in San Francisco and since the train is going that way, the ""good Samaritans"" figure they will bring him to ""the law"" in California.  Yet during the journey, people start turning up dead.  This sets the stage for a great movie.I will admit, the movie starts out a bit slow but picks up quickly.  I was surprised how this movie was more mystery than western.  Of course the movie has that western flare due to the time period, but I felt the mystery really drove this motion picture.There was lots of adventure and action, also a couple of dummies (which in many cases looks better than CGI in modern movies).  Also I felt this movie was quite brutal despite the PG rating.....times have changed.  Look for the fight sequence on top of the train, one of the best scenes in the film. I would love to know just where this movie was filmed, absolutely beautiful landscape.Overall ""Breakheart Pass"" was a great mystery, a great western, a great adventure and a great performance by Charles Bronson.

Based on the novel by Alistair MacLean, the movie begins with a train loaded with troops and medicine stopping in a small town called Myrtle City.  The train takes on two passengers, John Deakim, a gambler accused of murder, and Nathan Pearce, a U.S. Marshal.  It is revealed the train is traveling to Fort Humboldt to deliver some much needed medical supplies.  But soon, dead bodies start appearing, and we realize something more sinister is going on.  I was suprised by how much I enjoyed this movie.  There are enough plot twists and suprises to keep you entertained, and several good action scenes.  Throw in a very catchy Jerry Goldsmith score and how can you lose?I've said this in other reviews of Bronson movies, but moviegoers often assume Charles Bronson is a one-trick pony, that he can't play anything other than his Paul Kersey Death Wish character, but here is another role that proves otherwise.  Bronson plays John Deakim, a gambler accused of murder who knows more than he is letting on during the train trip.  Ben Johnson co-stars as U.S. Marshal Pearce, a deputy marshal who finds his way onto the train with Deakim.  The strong supporting cast includes Richard Crenna as Governor Fairchild, the governor of the unnamed territory, Jill Ireland as Marica Scoville, a young woman visiting her father, Charles Durning as O'Brien, the railroad represenative, Ed Lauter as Major Claremont, the officer in charge, and Bill McKinney as Peabody, a travelling reverend.  The DVD offers a pretty nice looking widescreen presentation and trailers.  Don't judge this book by its cover.  I didn't think a murder mystery western on a train sounded very good, but I really enjoyed this movie.

562019,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00004ZBVI,trebe,"[6, 9]","A tale of mystery and suspense in a western setting is rather uncommon, making Breakheart Pass an unusual film.  It is based on the novel by Scottish author Alistair MacLean, who also wrote the screenplay.  The story is centered on an army troop train on its way to Fort Humbolt, where there is apparently a medical emergency.  The train is loaded with medical supplies and relief troops to replace those suffering from an epidemic.  The cast is headed by Charles Bronson, as John Deakin an accused killer, and fugitive from the law.  Also on board are the arresting marshal (Ben Johnson), the army troop commander (Ed Lauter), a trainman (Charles Durning), and a governor (Richard Crenna) and his mistress (Jill Ireland aka Mrs. Bronson).While at a train stop, Deakin is arrested, and put on board the train for transport to the stockade at Humbolt.  Already strange things have begun to happen, as two soldiers have disappeared.  With an urgent mission to complete, the train must get under way.  Trouble and misfortune begin to mount.  A passenger is found dead, and then a train worker has a fatal fall.  Next a whole carload of soldiers suffers a catastrophe.  The survivors push on towards the fort, but find themselves with no way to communicate, as their telegraph set is mysteriously missing.  What is happening, and who is behind it?  Deakin investigates to try get to the bottom of the dark and deadly plot.  Outlaws, Indians, guns and gold all figure into the mix.  Deakin takes command of the train as it heads for a showdown in Breakheart Pass.Breakheart Pass was written when MacLean's best works were already behind him.  While it doesn't rank as one of his best books, it does make pretty good material for the big screen.  The film is not outstanding, either as a western or as an action-adventure.  It does however offer a different slant on the standard western story, and is presented in an easily accessible way.  MacLean's script is handled capably by the large distinguished cast, under the direction of TV veteran Tom Gries.  Charles Bronson's performance is very solid, and he competently carries the film.  A couple of ex-athletes are also part of the train crew.  Former boxer Archie Moore, plays the cook and gives Bronson all he can handle in a battle on the roof of the train.  And former California and Viking QB Joe Kapp plays a train steward working for more than just tips.Jerry Goldsmith's rousing theme music starts the movie, and then his score continues to effectively add to the enjoyment of the film.  The transfer to DVD is good, but in certain scenes the poor quality of the original material shows.  The DVD edition provides both widescreen and fullscreen versions, but no other extras except a tattered copy of the original trailer for the film.",3,An atypical western...,1019174400,"04 19, 2002",2002,2790,"['tale', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'western', 'setting', 'rather', 'uncommon', 'making', 'Breakheart', 'Pass', 'unusual', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Scottish', 'author', 'Alistair', 'MacLean', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'story', 'centered', 'army', 'troop', 'train', 'way', 'Fort', 'Humbolt', 'where', 'apparently', 'medical', 'emergency', 'train', 'loaded', 'medical', 'supplies', 'relief', 'troops', 'replace', 'suffering', 'epidemic', 'cast', 'headed', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'John', 'Deakin', 'accused', 'killer', 'fugitive', 'law', 'Also', 'board', 'are', 'arresting', 'marshal', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'army', 'troop', 'commander', 'Ed', 'Lauter', 'trainman', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'governor', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'mistress', 'Jill', 'Ireland', 'aka', 'Mrs.', 'Bronson', '.While', 'train', 'stop', 'Deakin', 'arrested', 'put', 'board', 'train', 'transport', 'stockade', 'Humbolt', 'Already', 'strange', 'things', 'have', 'begun', 'happen', 'two', 'soldiers', 'have', 'disappeared', 'urgent', 'mission', 'complete', 'train', 'must', 'get', 'way', 'Trouble', 'misfortune', 'begin', 'mount', 'passenger', 'found', 'dead', 'then', 'train', 'worker', 'fatal', 'fall', 'whole', 'carload', 'soldiers', 'suffers', 'catastrophe', 'survivors', 'push', 'towards', 'fort', 'find', 'way', 'communicate', 'telegraph', 'set', 'mysteriously', 'missing', 'What', 'happening', 'who', 'Deakin', 'try', 'get', 'bottom', 'dark', 'deadly', 'plot', 'Outlaws', 'Indians', 'guns', 'gold', 'figure', 'mix', 'Deakin', 'command', 'train', 'showdown', 'Breakheart', 'Pass.Breakheart', 'Pass', 'was', 'written', 'when', 'MacLean', 'best', 'works', 'were', 'already', ""n't"", 'rank', 'one', 'best', 'books', 'make', 'pretty', 'good', 'material', 'big', 'screen', 'film', 'not', 'outstanding', 'either', 'western', 'action-adventure', 'however', 'offer', 'different', 'slant', 'standard', 'western', 'story', 'presented', 'easily', 'accessible', 'way', 'MacLean', 'script', 'handled', 'capably', 'large', 'distinguished', 'cast', 'direction', 'TV', 'veteran', 'Tom', 'Gries', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'performance', 'very', 'solid', 'competently', 'film', 'couple', 'ex-athletes', 'are', 'also', 'part', 'train', 'crew', 'Former', 'boxer', 'Archie', 'Moore', 'cook', 'Bronson', 'can', 'handle', 'battle', 'roof', 'train', 'former', 'California', 'Viking', 'QB', 'Joe', 'Kapp', 'train', 'steward', 'working', 'more', 'just', 'tips.Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'rousing', 'theme', 'music', 'movie', 'then', 'score', 'effectively', 'add', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'good', 'certain', 'scenes', 'poor', 'quality', 'original', 'material', 'shows', 'DVD', 'edition', 'widescreen', 'fullscreen', 'versions', 'other', 'extras', 'tattered', 'copy', 'original', 'trailer', 'film']",N/A

Breakheart Pass is probably the best of the last burst of quality output in the actor's oeuvre that also saw Hard Times (aka The Streetfighter) and the whimsical From Noon Til Three; for that matter, the last good Alistair MacLean screen outing before what seems like an eternity of formulaic made-for-TV efforts with C-list casts.The plot has all the MacLean staples - sabotage, secret identities, wolves in sheep's clothing and a plot where no-one and nothing is what they appear to be. The only novelty is the location, a train rushing through the old West to bring medical supplies to a cholera-infected fort through strikingly snowbound mountain countryside beautifully captured through cinematographer Lucien Ballard's lens. But the fact that so much of the film is simply one of the author's beloved WW2 plots with outlaws and Indians instead of Nazis doesn't matter: it's the telling that counts, and with a tight script and strong direction from Tom Gries that is equally adept at the mystery (more a 'what the heck's going on?' than 'who's behind it all?') as action (most notably a good rooftop punch-up and a spectacular wreck) it's never a dull ride.Bronson, still making an effort in those days, comes over well, while the strong supporting cast (including John Ford and Sam Peckinpah regular Ben Johnson, as well as Richard Crenna, Charles Durning and Ed Lauter) add a pleasing layer of professionalism and credibility. Even Jill Ireland, never the most interesting of leading ladies, acquits herself well here.Everyone here has done better work (check out Gries' extraordinarily affecting Will Penny or Ballard's work on The Wild Bunch), and it's not a life-changing experience, but that's not the point. This is an audience picture that sets out to entertain you for an hour-and-a-half, and succeeds admirably. And Jerry Goldsmith's terrific and exhilaratingly exciting score - his best in the genre - is the icing on the cake.",4,A train worth catching,1077148800,"02 19, 2004",2004,2218,"['Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'slog', 'soul-destroying', 'ITC', 'Cannon-years', 'output', 'will', 'find', 'hard', 'imagine', 'was', 'ever', 'time', 'when', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'was', 'half-decent', 'actor', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'made', 'films', 'were', 'actually', 'released', 'theaters', 'good', 'ones', 'Breakheart', 'Pass', 'probably', 'best', 'last', 'burst', 'quality', 'output', 'actor', 'oeuvre', 'also', 'saw', 'Hard', 'Times', 'Streetfighter', 'whimsical', 'From', 'Noon', 'Til', 'Three', 'matter', 'last', 'good', 'Alistair', 'MacLean', 'screen', 'outing', 'what', 'eternity', 'formulaic', 'made-for-TV', 'efforts', 'C-list', 'casts.The', 'plot', 'MacLean', 'sabotage', 'secret', 'identities', 'wolves', 'sheep', 'clothing', 'plot', 'where', 'no-one', 'nothing', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'only', 'novelty', 'location', 'train', 'rushing', 'old', 'West', 'bring', 'medical', 'supplies', 'cholera-infected', 'fort', 'strikingly', 'snowbound', 'mountain', 'countryside', 'beautifully', 'captured', 'cinematographer', 'Lucien', 'Ballard', 'lens', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'simply', 'one', 'author', 'beloved', 'WW2', 'plots', 'outlaws', 'Indians', 'instead', 'Nazis', ""n't"", 'matter', 'telling', 'tight', 'script', 'strong', 'direction', 'Tom', 'Gries', 'equally', 'adept', 'mystery', 'more', ""'what"", 'heck', 'going', 'action', 'most', 'notably', 'good', 'rooftop', 'punch-up', 'spectacular', 'wreck', 'never', 'dull', 'ride.Bronson', 'still', 'making', 'effort', 'days', 'over', 'well', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'John', 'Ford', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'regular', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'as', 'well', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'Ed', 'Lauter', 'add', 'pleasing', 'layer', 'professionalism', 'credibility', 'Even', 'Jill', 'Ireland', 'never', 'most', 'interesting', 'leading', 'ladies', 'acquits', 'well', 'here.Everyone', 'here', 'done', 'better', 'work', 'check', 'out', 'Gries', 'extraordinarily', 'affecting', 'Will', 'Penny', 'Ballard', 'work', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'not', 'life-changing', 'experience', 'not', 'point', 'audience', 'picture', 'out', 'entertain', 'hour-and-a-half', 'admirably', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'terrific', 'exhilaratingly', 'exciting', 'score', 'best', 'genre', 'icing', 'cake']",N/A

It is more of a 'who done it' murder mystery ala Murder on the Orient Express but set in a western theme. Bronson plays a mysterious passanger who is not what he seems.

Other passengers on the train include the governor, his fiance, a US marshal, a priest, a doctor, and an army officer.  Things are not what they seem as a complex plot is slowly revealed.  This is the kind of Western that anyone who likes Westerns or action films can watch over and over again.  Is this a `great' film?  No.  Is this film making some profound statement about the human condition?  No.  Is a train ride to Breakheart Pass exciting?  Hell Yes!  There is so much to like about this film.  The plot contains lots of interesting twists and turns that'll keep you guessing (assuming you haven't watched it a zillion times already).  Lots of great actors (Charles Bronson, Ben Johnson, Jill Ireland).  One of the best fight scenes ever filmed with Charles Bronson duking it out with former World Champion prize fighter Archie Moore on the top of a snow covered train as it rambles through the mountains.  Several good gunfights, and a great love story to boot!  The score is also outstanding, every time I watch this film I can't get the music out of my head.  The cinematography is great too.
