It opens your eyes to what a woman's body can do in a very tasteful yet blunt manner.  Eve is amazingly direct and unfazed by the content, speaking frankly, sincerely and at times with great humor.  It brings to light the plight of the women in the Baltic countries being raped and tortured as well as women here in the States that have been raped and the aftermath.  You'll laugh, cry and get very angry all within the hour and a half Eve is on stage.  Kudos for having the guts to get the message out to those who need to hear.",5,A Very Funny and Moving DVD,1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,607,"['think', 'everyone', 'should', 'watch', '34', 'documentary', '34', 'performance', 'Eve', 'eyes', 'what', 'woman', 'body', 'can', 'do', 'very', 'tasteful', 'yet', 'blunt', 'manner', 'Eve', 'amazingly', 'direct', 'unfazed', 'content', 'speaking', 'frankly', 'sincerely', 'times', 'great', 'humor', 'light', 'plight', 'women', 'Baltic', 'countries', 'being', 'raped', 'tortured', 'as', 'well', 'women', 'here', 'States', 'have', 'been', 'raped', 'aftermath', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'cry', 'get', 'very', 'angry', 'hour', 'half', 'Eve', 'stage', 'Kudos', 'having', 'guts', 'get', 'message', 'who', 'need', 'hear']",N/A

Or should I say, it's ""built-in audience?"" A built-in audience which makes up more than half the population on this planet. This movie is well, preaching to the choir. But maybe it should be.One thing I could not understand for the life of me...Now keep in mind...I understood why so many women got into it. I understood why it was a big hit, even the foundation for a revolution. And I understood why the thing eventually This thing won an Obie for Best New Play. Why? This is NOT a play. This is nothing like a play. It's a bunch of, well... vagina monologues. Jokes and stories about... ""the smell,"" jokes and stories about sex, bleeding and whatnot. The vagina is an opening to the woman herself.Not merely her body, but who she truly is as a person. An opening into another whole world... her world. I couldn't finish it cause I got too creeped out by what was going on. Yeeesh. I told my sister Brie about some of it and what I was reading and she was horrified. ""That's sick! I don't wanna hear about any of that nasty stuff!""Hey, she was right. This is the kind of thing that is for women who are comfortable with their... you know.""TVM"" contains... well, exactly what the title promises. Musings, insights, poetry... even stories of sex, rape and abortion. All deep links as to... what's going on ""down there."" And how it connects... to everything else around.Most guys would rather hear a group of women talking about their monthly... you know... than hear this.I recommend this for women... who want to hear touching female stories and experiences. But not for any guy. Anywhere. Ever. It's ""The Vagina Monologues."" You know what to expect. You know if you're the audience.You know who you are.NOTE: I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE.

700711,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B00006673K,David Anderson,"[25, 28]","Eve Ensler produced, wrote, and performed ""The Vagina Monologues"" that debuted in 1996.  Since then, this off-Broadway one-person play has since been featured in many parts of the world.  Her words give women the power to be more open about their vaginas, an organ that some unfortunately call taboo to express.  This fearless performer offers humor, wit, and serious to certain issues, all in the correct areas.  She gives new meaning to issues beyond the vagina with more than just her words.  Her vocal expressions empower them tremendously.  She also expresses great pride to the female orgasm, masturbation, lesbianism, and reclaiming certain offensive words.  Amazingly, she performs the entire piece sitting down.  Most performers don't do that.Each individual monologue tells its individual story beautifully and expressively.  The featured interviews give multiple perspectives to each issue.  Whether they are humorous (looking ""down there"", sex, orgasmic sounds) or touching (rape, witnessing birth), all have the empowering impact that forces audiences to look beyond themselves.  Therefore, ""The Vagina Monologues"" is recommended for everyone.  Though nothing beats the live experience, this DVD recollects this piece beautifully.

She tells each story exactly as the interviewee had told her, mimicking the voice and emotion so well that she became the interviewee.  Between each segment of the onstage performance, there were video clips of the women Ensler had interviewed.  They were women of all ages and varying ethnicities.This was a neat show to watch.  The frankness of the subject made me uncomfortable at first.  But as the show progressed, I began to relate to these women on several levels.  I felt joy, disgust, pain, and awe as Ensler told these stories.  She has a great stage presence.The Vagina Monologues isn't about vaginas per se, but about femininity and the taboos and myths that surround it.

Pawl ""Dani""","[10, 12]","Though some may be phased by the title of this play, alone, that shouldn't stop them from watching this series of monologues, brought from ""Off Off Broadway"" to the big screen.  Eve Enders, the woman who brings the stories to the stage, is charismatic, funny and quasi-tragic all in the same breath.  Though, the theory of this play is based on the vagina (a part of the female anatomy, deemed unspeakable in ""polite"" conversation), it is about so much more.  Enders touches on many subjects that deal with women, identity, relationships and sexuality.  While some of the stories are about sexual awakening and self discovery, others deal with exploitation, rape and abuse.  Enders based these monologues on (literally) hundreds of interviews she conducted with women, nationally and internationally.  The topics range from lesbianism to childbirth.Though, this play has some strong language and the subject matter probably wouldn't be appropriate for young children, I think that women, young and old, should watch this together.  Not only does it bring down walls and barriers in open discussion, pertaining to womens' sexual and gender identity, it also sheds new light on women's struggle for liberation and expression.  I commend Eve Enders for her great performance, and sensitive, honest and unabashedly bold approach to the subject matter and cautionary nature of her topic(s).",5,"an important one-woman show, transcending gender and sexual identity.....",1132876800,"11 25, 2005",2005,1385,"['may', 'be', 'phased', 'title', 'play', 'alone', 'should', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'series', 'monologues', 'brought', 'Off', 'Off', 'Broadway', 'big', 'screen', 'Eve', 'Enders', 'woman', 'who', 'stories', 'stage', 'charismatic', 'funny', 'quasi-tragic', 'same', 'breath', 'theory', 'play', 'based', 'vagina', 'part', 'female', 'anatomy', 'deemed', 'unspeakable', 'polite', 'conversation', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Enders', 'touches', 'many', 'subjects', 'deal', 'women', 'identity', 'relationships', 'sexuality', 'stories', 'are', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'self', 'discovery', 'others', 'deal', 'exploitation', 'rape', 'abuse', 'Enders', 'based', 'monologues', 'literally', 'hundreds', 'interviews', 'conducted', 'women', 'nationally', 'internationally', 'topics', 'range', 'lesbianism', 'childbirth.Though', 'play', 'strong', 'language', 'subject', 'matter', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'appropriate', 'young', 'children', 'think', 'women', 'young', 'old', 'should', 'watch', 'together', 'Not', 'only', 'bring', 'down', 'walls', 'barriers', 'open', 'discussion', 'pertaining', 'womens', 'sexual', 'gender', 'identity', 'also', 'new', 'light', 'women', 'struggle', 'liberation', 'expression', 'commend', 'Eve', 'Enders', 'great', 'performance', 'sensitive', 'honest', 'unabashedly', 'bold', 'approach', 'subject', 'matter', 'cautionary', 'nature', 'topic', 's']",N/A

I do not know how this material was presented on stage, but on this DVD, it comes off as an enjoyable, sometimes disturbing; sometimes funny, sometimes quite melancholy documentary.I found most of the interviewees to have little new information to contribute to the national dialogue, but what is important is watching their range of emotion as they discuss something that is much more mysterious than it should be. Is it because of the still-in-business Patriarchal establishment which is more comfortable with women as servants to men, than as fully realized, equally sexual beings? Stories of men overpowering women in a violent way, delivered in a quiet manner, will move you to tears. Then move you to say...women, learn those martial arts!Didn't find much detail here on what turns on the ""average"" female: is the old cliche that she is less visually oriented than the male, more moved by sound, by atmosphere, by attitude, still valid?Ensler emerges as a first-rate stand-up comedian, who managed to write something very valuable, and find a very engaging way to present it.Being familiar with some related literature from the '80s, which covered some of this ground, I did expect a little more, however.There's some unnecessary backstage stuff, including a flash of a photo which is not for minors.

I watched it and found it to be an incredibly self-absorbed, narcissistic exercise. Ensler may be a fine person off-stage, but her performance is unendingly annoying, taking her sex organs way too seriously. This material seems to have found a home with the feminist, pro-choice, power lesbian crowd and I can see why. It's not a bad program. I'm a guy, alright - if any of my man friends talked about their cocks in this manner, they'd be laughed out of the place. Don't get me wrong: I love pussy (and mouths / tongues and butts even MORE), and I am moved whenever I've read accounts of women who've suffered genital mutilation. It's just the way Ensler keeps milking the word ""vagina"" dry for comedic effect that really irritates the hell out of me.
