Although some interesting things are answered on this DVD it asks far more than it answers. But the characters are starting to get deeper and not so wooden. The conspiracies are thick and nothing is what it appears. A healthy dose of mystery wraped in a large metal skin.,4,Stop dancing or you will unleash the terror,1006646400,"11 25, 2001",2001,361,"['series', 'odd', 'effect', 'not', 'making', 'sense', 'yet', 'still', 'compelling', 'watch', 'interesting', 'things', 'are', 'answered', 'DVD', 'far', 'more', 'characters', 'are', 'starting', 'get', 'deeper', 'not', 'so', 'wooden', 'conspiracies', 'are', 'thick', 'nothing', 'what', 'healthy', 'dose', 'mystery', 'wraped', 'large', 'metal', 'skin']",Gasaraki: Volume 3 - Betrayal

Instead, it the plot is unfolding, going in directions I never suspected. Gasaraki is showing itself to be theX-Filesof anime series as the plot is propelled more by men in suits, meeting in smoke filled back rooms to plot the future of the world (or at least the country) than it is by mecha battles.This volume contained the single best episode so far (`Inferno' I think was the name) where a couple of Belgistani T.A.s infiltrate the Gowa corporation's headquarters. While it was a little funny watching a walking tank sneak through the hallways of a modern office building, if you can accept that, it was done very well, with lot of tension.Some of the Gowa family's secrets are revealed and more questions are raised.

561117,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B00004Z4TZ,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","After the war has ended, Yushiro returns to Japan. He is torn between his loyalty for his family and his loyalty for his team members. He makes a discovery about himself that throws his world into chaos. Is he really Yushiro, is he really human? I sure as heck don't know. He goes on a quest to find the truth about his identity. The basis for the TA platform is also revealed. Many questions were present before, and many more have risen.This volume started out kind of boring. The 1st episode where the team arrives in Japan and is detained kind of made me sleepy. The next 2 episodes are much better. Yoshiro starts searching for the truth about his past. I'm starting to get a little more interested in this series than I was at the beginning. My 1 major complaint is a big one though. This series seems to be focused more on a political and military conspiracy than on the characters. Most of the series so far has been spent in closed rooms watching big shots speak enigmatically about the TAs, Yoshiro, and the current political state of the world. There is a main character, Yoshiro, but he is not followed and focused on enough for the series to gain much depth. I said earlier that I'm getting more interested in this series. That is true. I am also getting frustrated with it. The mystery is intriguing, but not developing the characters any more than the writers have is kind of pissing me off. The series is half over already. If they don't develop the characters any more than this I'm afraid that I'll lose interest.",4,"Focused on the story, not the characters",1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,1531,"['war', 'ended', 'Yushiro', 'Japan', 'torn', 'loyalty', 'family', 'loyalty', 'team', 'members', 'discovery', 'world', 'chaos', 'really', 'Yushiro', 'really', 'human', 'sure', 'heck', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'quest', 'find', 'truth', 'identity', 'basis', 'TA', 'platform', 'also', 'revealed', 'Many', 'questions', 'were', 'present', 'before', 'many', 'more', 'have', 'risen.This', 'volume', 'started', 'out', 'kind', 'boring', '1st', 'episode', 'where', 'team', 'Japan', 'detained', 'kind', 'made', 'sleepy', 'next', '2', 'episodes', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'searching', 'truth', 'past', ""'m"", 'starting', 'get', 'little', 'more', 'interested', 'series', 'was', 'beginning', '1', 'major', 'complaint', 'big', 'one', 'though', 'series', 'be', 'focused', 'more', 'political', 'military', 'conspiracy', 'characters', 'Most', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'been', 'spent', 'closed', 'rooms', 'watching', 'big', 'shots', 'speak', 'enigmatically', 'TAs', 'Yoshiro', 'current', 'political', 'state', 'world', 'main', 'character', 'Yoshiro', 'not', 'followed', 'focused', 'enough', 'series', 'gain', 'much', 'depth', 'said', 'earlier', ""'m"", 'getting', 'more', 'interested', 'series', 'true', 'am', 'also', 'getting', 'frustrated', 'mystery', 'intriguing', 'not', 'developing', 'characters', 'more', 'writers', 'have', 'kind', 'pissing', 'series', 'half', 'already', 'do', ""n't"", 'develop', 'characters', 'more', ""'m"", 'afraid', ""'ll"", 'lose', 'interest']",Gasaraki: Volume 3 - Betrayal

561119,A2O0CFU9Q9XK3,B00004Z4TZ,"""madnessmark""","[1, 1]","After some complications, the TA team returns to Japan. The TA staff are put into quarentine while Gowa is held at another building. Meanwhile, Kazukiyo meets with a man who wants to change Japan in three years. While Captain Ataka sneaks out of quarentine, Symbol attempts to get back the TA sample with two Fakes. One is piloted by Miharu. The other TA pilot steels the sample while Miharu checks the data files on Yushiro. Two names come up. One is Yushiro's current status, alive and well, while the other says that Yushiro died 8 years ago. Miharu runs into Yushiro and tells him this. Filled with mixed feelings, Yushiro runs to the shrine to meet his master and find out the truth while Captain Ataka helps Misuzu (Yushiro's little sister) find him. While at the shrine, Yushiro finds bodies of those who tried to summon Gasaraki a while back and Yushiro discovers the fabled Kugai warrior. The two TA's from Symbol show up at the shrine to find more info. Miharu finds Yushiro next to the Kugai and tells him to get away. But before he can, his mind goes warped, he does the dance of Gasarak and gets inside the Kugai. An Evangelion style battle ensues and I must say that the Kugai is very impressive. It has a massive sword and even though it never gets to use it, the Kugai is still pretty cool. It rips apart the two Fakes like they're nothing. The last episode ends with the TA team trying out a new drug which drove one of the four pilots who are testing it to go insane. This volume doesn't have a lot of action, but the last episode should please everyone. If you don't understand some of the topics, the DVD includes a glossary and episode sheets to help you understand. The director interview was pretty good with discussing mecha anime, but the real treat is the behind the scenes feature. We get a 6 minute video of the dub voice actress who plays Miharu working on the show. Its very fun to watch and I hope ADV can put other voice actors on in more volumes to come. One little thing that I think is odd is that the Fakes get the spotlight on this volume and everyone calls them Beligstanian TAs. Anyway, an extremely well done DVD that will aplease any fan of the series.

561120,AKFVX5CFY5E4J,B00004Z4TZ,"""nogana_naishi""","[2, 2]","Gasaraki is truly one of the most quickly captivating &quot;mecha&quot; anime I have ever had the opportunity to watch, and by volume three it has not yet let me down. In volume three, the war against Belgistan has finally come to an end, and Yushiro and Miharu have been seperated from one another, for what seems like the last time.Peace doesn't last long as Belgistanian forces infiltrate the Gowa complex and uncover a shocking secret about Yushiro's past. Yushiro must now contemplate his very identity as he goes on a journey to discover answers to questions shrouded in mystery and obscured by history. As a result of this revelation, Miharu's new mission is to capture Yushiro and bring him back to Belgistan, but will she be able to do so before he awakens a hellish monster sleeping deep within the Gowa shrine? Meanwhile, the Japanese forces start testing a new drug that will enhance fighting ability inside the TA's, but its results can be disastrous...Volume three of Gasaraki keeps you constantly on your toes as more and more secrets are revealed. The video and audio quality is superb, and what you can nomally come to expect from ADVision's releases on DVD. Another thing you can expect from ADV is the sheer amount of extras that will be put on their releases. Everything from character sketches to an interview with the director of Gasaraki, and even a recording session with a voice actor. There's even a glossary of terms used in Gasaraki to help you sort out what means what. The DVD menus are also very pleasant to look at and look like they were very professionaly done, unlike the DVDs released by most anime companies.If I had to find a single down side to this DVD would be the small amount of episodes on it. While 3 episodes may still be customary for a VHS release, 3 episodes on DVD is almost nothing. With companies like Bandai releasing 5 or more episodes of their shows on a single DVD, a mere 3 is quite pathetic.Overall, Gasaraki Volume 3 on DVD is almost perfect, with a few tiny flaws. ADV is one company that knows what it's doing with a new great technology like DVD, and Gasaraki proves that.",5,Another amazing volume of Gasaraki,981417600,"02 6, 2001",2001,2134,"['Gasaraki', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'quickly', 'captivating', 'quot', 'quot', 'anime', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'volume', 'three', 'not', 'yet', 'let', 'down', 'volume', 'three', 'war', 'Belgistan', 'finally', 'come', 'end', 'Yushiro', 'Miharu', 'have', 'been', 'seperated', 'one', 'what', 'last', 'time.Peace', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'Belgistanian', 'forces', 'infiltrate', 'Gowa', 'complex', 'uncover', 'shocking', 'secret', 'Yushiro', 'past', 'must', 'now', 'contemplate', 'very', 'identity', 'journey', 'discover', 'answers', 'questions', 'shrouded', 'mystery', 'obscured', 'history', 'result', 'revelation', 'Miharu', 'new', 'mission', 'capture', 'Yushiro', 'bring', 'back', 'Belgistan', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'so', 'hellish', 'monster', 'sleeping', 'deep', 'Gowa', 'shrine', 'Meanwhile', 'Japanese', 'forces', 'start', 'testing', 'new', 'drug', 'will', 'enhance', 'fighting', 'ability', 'TA', 'results', 'can', 'be', 'disastrous', 'Volume', 'three', 'Gasaraki', 'constantly', 'toes', 'more', 'more', 'secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'superb', 'what', 'can', 'nomally', 'come', 'expect', 'ADVision', 'releases', 'DVD', 'thing', 'can', 'expect', 'ADV', 'sheer', 'amount', 'extras', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'releases', 'Everything', 'character', 'sketches', 'interview', 'director', 'Gasaraki', 'even', 'recording', 'session', 'voice', 'actor', 'even', 'glossary', 'terms', 'used', 'Gasaraki', 'help', 'sort', 'out', 'what', 'what', 'DVD', 'menus', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'pleasant', 'look', 'look', 'were', 'very', 'professionaly', 'done', 'DVDs', 'released', 'most', 'anime', 'companies.If', 'had', 'find', 'single', 'down', 'side', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'small', 'amount', 'episodes', '3', 'episodes', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'customary', 'VHS', 'release', '3', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'almost', 'nothing', 'companies', 'Bandai', 'releasing', '5', 'more', 'episodes', 'shows', 'single', 'DVD', 'mere', '3', 'quite', 'pathetic.Overall', 'Gasaraki', 'Volume', '3', 'DVD', 'almost', 'perfect', 'few', 'tiny', 'flaws', 'ADV', 'one', 'company', 'what', 'doing', 'new', 'great', 'technology', 'DVD', 'Gasaraki']",Gasaraki: Volume 3 - Betrayal
