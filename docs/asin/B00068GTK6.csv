Even the cover of this movie is bad.  It shows Sandra Bullock in the foreground but she only plays a supporting role in the movie.  It's the man in the background (Jonathan Penner) who has the lead role.  It makes me wonder if the cover was made this way just to sell the movie.  Penner loses his job and starts his own business by making his own religion but it was done in poor taste.  Even if you are a Sanra Bullock fan, there are far better movies than this one.",1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,580,"['movie', 'far', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'worth', 'buying', 'let', 'alone', 'renting', 'Even', 'cover', 'movie', 'bad', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'foreground', 'only', 'supporting', 'role', 'movie', 'man', 'background', 'Jonathan', 'Penner', 'who', 'lead', 'role', 'wonder', 'cover', 'was', 'made', 'way', 'just', 'sell', 'movie', 'Penner', 'job', 'own', 'business', 'making', 'own', 'religion', 'was', 'done', 'poor', 'taste', 'Even', 'are', 'Sanra', 'Bullock', 'fan', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'movies', 'one']",N/A

I need not have bothered. She is a very minor character with minimal screen time. She does well in her few moments but that is not enough to make this a ""good show"".The story revolves around a Madison Avenue type who thinks he has a divine mission to found a new religion. He sets about hsi task with all of the market research tools at his disposal and manages to fleece his flock of much of their disposable income. Near the end, he begins to see the light and reforms himself.There are a few brief moments of laughter, a few moments of Sandra in briefs but the the redeeming moments are all too brief.",2,Not too good even with beautiful Sandra,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,710,"['admit', 'bought', 'one', 'think', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'beautiful', 'looked', 'nice', 'box', 'need', 'not', 'have', 'bothered', 'very', 'minor', 'character', 'minimal', 'screen', 'time', 'well', 'few', 'moments', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'good', 'show', '.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Madison', 'Avenue', 'type', 'who', 'divine', 'mission', 'found', 'new', 'religion', 'hsi', 'task', 'market', 'research', 'tools', 'disposal', 'manages', 'fleece', 'flock', 'much', 'disposable', 'income', 'end', 'see', 'light', 'reforms', 'are', 'few', 'brief', 'moments', 'laughter', 'few', 'moments', 'Sandra', 'briefs', 'redeeming', 'moments', 'are', 'too', 'brief']",N/A

When I happened across this one, I was surprised I had never heard of it--especially considering that it apparently starred Sandra Bullock. So, I bought it, watched it, and now I know why. The 2004 DVD cover has more production value than the movie itself. This looks extremely low-budget. Not Clerks low-budget, but about as close as you can get in color. It looks like it was shot on VHS. Sandra Bullock is barely in this movie and Penner is terrible. I mean, really bad. I feel bad, because I like the guy, but this is not his best. even Down Periscope is better than this--by a lot! In fact, Penner's own personality in real life is far more charming than most of the characters he's gotten to play, which is a shame because he is so likeable. He needs something developed just for him. Wish I had the means. If I were going to recommend a Penner movie, I'd say The Last Supper or Let the Devil Wear Black, both directed by his wife and both solid, under-seen films (the latter is really hard to find, though). Or, maybe just watch Survivor Phillipines again.",1,"Sadly, Penner's worst.",1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,1219,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Jonathan', 'Penner', 'based', 'winning', 'personality', 'three', 'seasons', 'Survivor', ""'ve"", 'started', 'tracking', 'down', 'films', 'When', 'happened', 'one', 'was', 'surprised', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'especially', 'considering', 'apparently', 'starred', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'So', 'bought', 'watched', 'now', 'know', 'why', '2004', 'DVD', 'cover', 'more', 'production', 'value', 'movie', 'extremely', 'low-budget', 'Not', 'Clerks', 'low-budget', 'as', 'close', 'can', 'get', 'color', 'was', 'shot', 'VHS', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'barely', 'movie', 'Penner', 'terrible', 'mean', 'really', 'bad', 'feel', 'bad', 'like', 'guy', 'not', 'best', 'even', 'Down', 'Periscope', 'better', 'lot', 'fact', 'Penner', 'own', 'personality', 'real', 'life', 'far', 'more', 'charming', 'most', 'characters', 'gotten', 'play', 'shame', 'so', 'likeable', 'something', 'developed', 'just', 'Wish', 'had', 'means', 'were', 'going', 'recommend', 'Penner', 'movie', ""'d"", 'say', 'Last', 'Supper', 'Let', 'Devil', 'Wear', 'Black', 'directed', 'wife', 'solid', 'under-seen', 'films', 'latter', 'really', 'hard', 'find', 'maybe', 'just', 'watch', 'Survivor', 'Phillipines', 'again']",N/A

The story is about a man who starts a new religion in order to make money. It's a great idea, but it could have been carried out in a better way. As for Sandra Bullock, she only plays a minor role and it's far from her best work.Overall, ""A Fool and His Money"" is an average late-1980s comedy. I didn't think it was as bad as the other reviewers, but also not great. Sandra Bullock fans may want to check it out, but be aware that she only plays a supporting role.
