And is directed by a woman (Haifaa al Mansour), no less, and has a quasi feminist theme as well. The simple plot centers around Wadjda (played by Waad Mohammed), a rowdy girl, about 11 years old, living in Riyad who dreams of owning a bicycle (in Saudi Arabia, the movie tells us, girls riding bicycles are frowned upon). In order to buy a bicycle, she enters a contest in her girls-only school for recitation of the Koran with a cash prize, despite the misgivings of the harsh, stern headmistress (played by an actress called simply Ahd, in perhaps the best performance of the film).The movie reminds me of some Iranian films of the past that also are centered on children (for example, Abbas Kiarostami&#8217;s early films or Majid Majidi &#8220;Pedar&#8221; and &#8220;Children of Heaven&#8221;). I suppose directors from conservative countries like Iran or Saudi Arabia chose movies centered on children&#8217;s since films dealing with adult themes would surely hit censorship issues. Perhaps the movie has more social interest than cinematic interest (though it is well filmed). It is fascinating to see the contrast between the relatively affluent society (Wadja&#8217;s house has all the latest gadgets) and the very conservative traditions of the country (at one point, for example, the mother of Wadjda is afraid that her husband will take a second wife, as it is allowed there). Or we see one of the girls in the school, of Wadjda&#8217;s age, showing the photos of her marriage to an older man. And once when Wadjda falls from a bicycle and draws blood, her mother is at first afraid her hymen has broken &#8211; virginity in women is extremely valued in Saudi Arabia.

I was intrigued by cultural and religious customs that this movie portrayed as prevalent/dominant in Saudi Arabia.  Wadjda strikes me as no different than many American children who like to push the boundaries a bit.  However, the boundaries being pushed by Wadjda in this movie are so basic that it calls into question why these boundaries exist at all... for example, why must she cover her head, or her face... why is it her duty to hide from men who may be looking in her direction?  Some might say that the above sentence needs to be preface with &#34;from an American perspective,&#34; but I would deny that culturally relativistic model of thinking, and say that the appropriate preface is, &#34;from a human perspective.&#34;  I am left wondering... how can a woman in Saudi Arabia ever hope to reach her potential as a human being --or find contentment-- while being constrained and subjugated in so many ways by men and/or by religion?",5,Thought-provoking & Entertaining!,1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,1025,"['relatively', 'simple', 'story', 'actors', 'deliver', 'well-crafted', 'script', 'was', 'intrigued', 'cultural', 'religious', 'customs', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'prevalent/dominant', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Wadjda', 'different', 'many', 'American', 'children', 'who', 'like', 'push', 'boundaries', 'bit', 'However', 'boundaries', 'being', 'pushed', 'Wadjda', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'basic', 'question', 'why', 'boundaries', 'exist', 'example', 'why', 'must', 'cover', 'head', 'face', 'why', 'duty', 'hide', 'men', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'looking', 'direction', 'might', 'say', 'above', 'sentence', 'needs', 'be', 'preface', '34', 'American', 'perspective', '34', 'would', 'deny', 'culturally', 'relativistic', 'model', 'thinking', 'say', 'appropriate', 'preface', '34', 'human', 'perspective.', '34', 'am', 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'can', 'woman', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'ever', 'hope', 'reach', 'potential', 'human', 'being', 'find', 'contentment', 'being', 'constrained', 'subjugated', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'men', 'and/or', 'religion']",Wadjda

One of the things I loved about this film is that it was not preachy about the rights or wrongs about a religion -- it was a story of a girl and it was told without being judgmental.  Wadjda could have been a girl anywhere in the world and her story could have been any girl's story about testing the boundaries, being confused about constraints because of gender, and feeling all the joys and frustrations that come with finding your place in the world. There was just enough humor and heartfelt emotion to make this a great movie, and it is even more amazing that the entire film was shot in Saudi Arabia.

This society not only stifles the spirit of men and women to be a free and to be a creative source of energy to propel advancement, it punishes those who do not use their energy to maintain the status quo.While the film is somewhat uplifting in that several people begin to transcend the dominant doctrines, it remains a sad statement of the oppression a society can demand of its people.This is a simple and honest story that is real in its elements that probably should be viewed by all peoples, no matter what their level of oppression may be.  It is told as a story and leaves the viewer to form any opinion,  In this regard it is a wonderful and intelligent film.As good as the film was, I could not give it 5 stars because it was not quite up to the artistic level of films to which I would give the highest rating.

1638342,A391RY3TA1MCVM,B00BU5YQQS,David Ljunggren,"[0, 1]","Wadjda is a gloriously clever film which operates on two distinct levels; ostensibly it is the story of an irrepressible 10-year-old girl in the Saudi capital Riyadh who wants to buy a bicycle and thinks up various ways of making the money she needs. Yet deeper down the movie (with remarkably clarity) also shows how marginalised women are in Saudi Arabia and how their second class status permeates every second of their daily existence. Girls are told not to look at men or even let men see them. Wadjda's mother tells her she won't be able to have children if she rides a bicycle. At the same time, Wadjda's father is about to abandon the family and take a second wife to bear him the son he craves. There are some pockets of relative liberalism: Wadjda's cousin works in a hospital where women don't have to wear veils and where they can talk in public to men they are not related to. The mother goes to the hospital to apply for a job but is so shocked that she leaves right away. There is no lecturing or moral heavy-handedness here. Wadjda's spirit pulls her through but at the very end, where we see her triumphant, we know her life as she knows it will soon come to an end. Once she hits puberty her ability to move freely will be severely curtailed. It's rare a film can be both uplifting and depressing and Wadjda pulls it off perfectly.

1638343,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00BU5YQQS,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[6, 7]","WADJDA is a straightforward tale of a young girl Wadjda (Waad Mohammed) growing up in a suburb of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, who wants to buy a bicycle.  Unable to find the money to do so, she enters a competition to speak the Koran in public with a substantial cash prize.  After considerable time spent studying the text, she wins the competition, but sadly doesn't receive the money.  In the end, however, she achieves her dreams - but not in the way she expects.  Haifaa Al-Mansour's film is noteworthy for being a woman's film directed by a woman; it shows in careful detail the ways in which women's lives are constructed in Saudi Arabia, as well as showing how influential the Koran is in determining people's behavior.  Some viewers might think that the women's lives are unfairly restricted; the film suggests that this is what many women believe is the right thing to do.  By doing so, WADJDA shows how different people embraces different concepts of Islam.  On the other hand, the film also suggests that individuals - especially children - should have at least some means to express themselves, particularly when they have worked to hard to achieve their aims.  To restrict them is also to repress them; and this ultimately leads them to accept subordination as a way of life.  WADJDA proves that the opposite should be true; not only for Wadjda herself but also for her mother (Reem Abdullah).",4,Optimistic Tale of Triumph Over Adversity,1386720000,"12 11, 2013",2013,1401,"['WADJDA', 'straightforward', 'tale', 'young', 'girl', 'Wadjda', 'Waad', 'Mohammed', 'growing', 'up', 'suburb', 'Riyadh', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'who', 'buy', 'bicycle', 'Unable', 'find', 'money', 'do', 'so', 'competition', 'speak', 'Koran', 'public', 'substantial', 'cash', 'prize', 'considerable', 'time', 'spent', 'studying', 'text', 'competition', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'receive', 'money', 'end', 'however', 'dreams', 'not', 'way', 'Haifaa', 'Al-Mansour', 'film', 'noteworthy', 'being', 'woman', 'film', 'directed', 'woman', 'careful', 'detail', 'ways', 'women', 'lives', 'are', 'constructed', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'as', 'well', 'showing', 'how', 'influential', 'Koran', 'determining', 'people', 'behavior', 'viewers', 'might', 'think', 'women', 'lives', 'are', 'unfairly', 'restricted', 'film', 'what', 'many', 'women', 'believe', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'doing', 'so', 'WADJDA', 'how', 'different', 'people', 'embraces', 'different', 'concepts', 'Islam', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'also', 'individuals', 'especially', 'children', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'means', 'express', 'particularly', 'when', 'have', 'worked', 'hard', 'achieve', 'aims', 'restrict', 'also', 'repress', 'ultimately', 'accept', 'subordination', 'way', 'life', 'WADJDA', 'opposite', 'should', 'be', 'true', 'not', 'only', 'Wadjda', 'also', 'mother', 'Reem', 'Abdullah']",Wadjda

It is very difficult for the world outside of Saudi Arabia to engage in a serious discussion of their cultural and political differences, and find a common ground between us. The aspirational longings of Wadjda for more freedom, and more existential fulfillment, might be a starting point. On the one hand--and let me be perfectly blunt--it's hard not to feel sympathetic towards a culture supposedly centered around an absolute love for God. On the other hand, the way that devotion is warped and twisted into authoritarianism and the spiritual and political suppression of women is deeply and profoundly distressing. How far the authoritarianism has strayed from the compassion and iconoclasm that once were at the very root of The Message. I think the way females are treated in Saudi Arabia is just terrible. Horrible. Cruel beyond belief, inexcusable, unforgivable, wrong minded, misdirected, dis-compassionate, unenlightened, and rooted in a serious misogynistic psychological disease. When you look at all the institutionalized restrictions placed upon females in Saudi society, you might think that women are the most dangerous force in the world--that must be shackled and restrained and guarded at every moment, like they were living, walking Plutonium, lest they go totally wild and drive all the males around them completely insane and out of control. One observation that was particularly annoying--in such a hot, arid climate, every female was completely cloaked in black. Every male, in much less restrictive, and cooler, clothing--wearing white. One word springs to mind: SICK. Even the white skull caps on the boys have holes that they may ventilate--the headscarves for the girls have no similar accommodation. Not even the tiniest little vent to let in fresh air.""A woman's voice is her nakedness!"" says the Principal of Wadjda's school. Yet this same voice, symbol as it is, of a woman's 'nakedness', is on full display in all it's beauty when Wadjda recites the holy Koran. Nobody tells her to shut up, then. When merit is measured by the memorization and recitation of scripture, it is hard to see how new ideas, or innovation, or the slightest creativity will ever, or can ever, emerge in such a place. I have been led to understand there are no public movie theaters in Saudi Arabia--and people will travel outside to neighboring countries on weekends to watch films. I hope they watch this one. It was financed by a prominent Saudi Prince, which gives one hope for the possibility of evolution in such a static culture, a place where a woman can simply lose her husband for good just for failing to provide him with a male heir--and where no female offspring may even be displayed on the family tree. Wadjda represents a glimmer of good news for anyone who hungers and thirsts for compassion, justice, and enlightenment, for sentient beings, anywhere.

This film is groundbreaking not only in being the first Saudi Arabian film by a female director, but the first Saudi Arabian film shot in Saudi Arabia. Reportedly, the director had to work from inside a van, to avoid contact with the male actors and crew.Although at its base a simple and heartwarming story of a girl who wants a bicycle, the real story is the presentation of the film's milieu to audiences outside the Kingdom who are unaware of the features of this strict, almost perverse society. This presentation is skillfully done. I can't imagine a fervently religious Saudi finding anything in it to object to (and obviously, they didn't, otherwise the film would not exist at all), but at the same time, an outsider will find the society as depicted to be inhumanly restrictive and shocking in its treatment of women. Getting both of these contradictory themes across is masterful.* * * SPOILER ALERT * * *The ending, like the ultimate future of Saudi Arabia itself, is ambiguous. Wadjda finally gets her bicycle, from her mother no less, who after her husband has taken a second wife, comes to see it as her daughter does; a symbol of female freedom and triumph over a brutal and subjugating system.

1638360,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00BU5YQQS,Mark Turner,"[3, 4]","It would be easy to take the big blockbuster released this week (in this case THOR: THE DARK WORLD) and write about it. By the same token I could write about a B movie making its way to DVD this week. But just for something different I thought I'd mention a small foreign film that's made its way to DVD that deserves some attention.Foreign films don't attract a lot of attention in the U.S. like most films do. It usually seems that a select elite class of film viewer watches these films or collectors of foreign films. We here seem to think that if someone can't take the time to make the movie in our language it isn't worth viewing. That sort of thinking means that so many great movies are not seen by a larger group of people in this country. It also means that we think far too much of ourselves when it comes to movies too.Not only do foreign films give us the opportunity to see some great movies it also opens the doors for us to see and understand a different culture than our own, a different world than the one we live in. There are a number of jokes out there about 'Muricans with redneck ways and an attitude that we are always the best. With the world of DVD open to everyone you now have the chance to see that there are some great movies being made around the world, even if you have to read subtitles to see them.With that I'd like to talk about WADJDA. Wadjda is a 10 year old Saudi Arabian girl with dreams of her own. Living in Riyadh, Wadjda pushes the boundaries of a girl in her culture, choosing to listen to rock music and developing an entrepreneurial attitude by creating shoelace bracelets that support various teams and selling them to classmates. Her home life is better than most but not perfect. Her mother nearly died during childbirth which means she can not bear a male child for her husband. This opens the door for him to find another wife who can. But that's down the road when the film opens.Wadjda goes to school and is viewed as a rebel there, even while other girls are doing far more outlandish things. While they paint their nails and read magazine, Wadjda is the most obvious rebel wearing tennis shoes instead of the black shoes the other girls wear and never seeming to be able to keep her scarf on her head. Her best friend is a young boy named Abdulah. As with most young boy and girl friends, they tease one another and call names but remain close. Wadjda is envious of her friend's bicycle and promises to buy one of her own even though the custom there is for girls to not ride bicycles since it would destroy their &#34;virtue&#34;. As you can see, a different culture than ours already.As Wadjda's mother struggles to keep her husband from taking on a second wife, she has little time to keep a closer eye on her daughter. Wadjda begins finding new ways to make money in the hopes of saving to buy the new bicycle she saw at the local toy store. But each money making idea she comes up with brings her closer to the edge of social acceptance and expulsion or shame at school. When they announce a contest that involves studying the Koran which involves memorization and understanding of the text, the prize for which is more than enough money for her needs, Wadjda enters.While she studies for the contest Wadjda never really digs into the text she's remembering. It is all about trying to win, not about really learning. Whether or not she does win and what happens when she does/doesn't makes for an interesting film.While the story isn't complicated and rather straightforward, the movie does hold your interest from start to finish. You never have an edge of your seat moment here but you find yourself caring for both the characters of Wadjda and her mother. And while the strict enforcement of this male dominated society is ever present, the hope for change can be seen in the acts and eyes of young Abdullah. You not only want Wadjda to win, you want to see her on the bicycle before the end of the film.Much has been noted about the production behind the scenes of this film. To begin with it was actually filmed in Saudi Arabia, a country that views films as sinful, especially with a subject content like this. On top of that the film was directed by Haifaa Al-Mansour, a female director. While the cast and crew followed custom as closely as possible, they were able to produce a film that can be enjoyed by all.Take a chance and open up the door to a new experience. Allow yourself to watch at least one foreign film with an open mind and a chance to see the world. If you have the chance, let this be that film and find out that not all foreign films are snobbish or elitist. Some just tell a story and do it well. WADJDA is one of those.",3,FOREIGN FILM COMES HOME,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,4709,"['would', 'be', 'easy', 'take', 'big', 'blockbuster', 'released', 'week', 'case', 'THOR', 'DARK', 'WORLD', 'same', 'token', 'could', 'write', 'B', 'movie', 'making', 'way', 'DVD', 'week', 'just', 'something', 'different', 'thought', ""'d"", 'mention', 'small', 'foreign', 'film', 'made', 'way', 'DVD', 'attention.Foreign', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'attract', 'lot', 'attention', 'U.S.', 'most', 'films', 'do', 'usually', 'select', 'elite', 'class', 'film', 'viewer', 'watches', 'films', 'collectors', 'foreign', 'films', 'here', 'seem', 'think', 'someone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'make', 'movie', 'language', ""n't"", 'worth', 'viewing', 'sort', 'thinking', 'means', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'seen', 'larger', 'group', 'people', 'country', 'also', 'think', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'movies', 'only', 'do', 'foreign', 'films', 'give', 'opportunity', 'see', 'great', 'movies', 'also', 'doors', 'see', 'understand', 'different', 'culture', 'own', 'different', 'world', 'one', 'live', 'are', 'number', 'jokes', 'there', ""'Muricans"", 'redneck', 'ways', 'attitude', 'are', 'always', 'best', 'world', 'DVD', 'open', 'everyone', 'now', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'are', 'great', 'movies', 'being', 'made', 'world', 'even', 'have', 'read', 'subtitles', 'see', ""'d"", 'like', 'talk', 'WADJDA', 'Wadjda', '10', 'year', 'old', 'Saudi', 'Arabian', 'girl', 'dreams', 'own', 'Living', 'Riyadh', 'Wadjda', 'boundaries', 'girl', 'culture', 'choosing', 'listen', 'rock', 'music', 'developing', 'entrepreneurial', 'attitude', 'creating', 'shoelace', 'bracelets', 'support', 'various', 'teams', 'selling', 'classmates', 'home', 'life', 'better', 'most', 'not', 'perfect', 'mother', 'nearly', 'died', 'childbirth', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'male', 'child', 'husband', 'door', 'find', 'wife', 'who', 'can', 'down', 'road', 'when', 'film', 'opens.Wadjda', 'school', 'viewed', 'rebel', 'there', 'even', 'other', 'girls', 'are', 'doing', 'far', 'more', 'outlandish', 'things', 'paint', 'nails', 'read', 'magazine', 'Wadjda', 'most', 'obvious', 'rebel', 'wearing', 'tennis', 'shoes', 'instead', 'black', 'shoes', 'other', 'girls', 'wear', 'never', 'seeming', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'scarf', 'head', 'best', 'friend', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Abdulah', 'most', 'young', 'boy', 'girl', 'friends', 'tease', 'one', 'call', 'names', 'remain', 'close', 'Wadjda', 'envious', 'friend', 'bicycle', 'promises', 'buy', 'one', 'own', 'even', 'custom', 'girls', 'not', 'ride', 'bicycles', 'would', 'destroy', '34', 'virtue', '34', 'can', 'see', 'different', 'culture', 'ours', 'already.As', 'Wadjda', 'mother', 'keep', 'husband', 'taking', 'second', 'wife', 'little', 'time', 'keep', 'closer', 'eye', 'daughter', 'Wadjda', 'finding', 'new', 'ways', 'make', 'money', 'hopes', 'saving', 'buy', 'new', 'bicycle', 'saw', 'local', 'toy', 'store', 'money', 'making', 'idea', 'up', 'brings', 'closer', 'edge', 'social', 'acceptance', 'expulsion', 'shame', 'school', 'When', 'announce', 'contest', 'studying', 'Koran', 'memorization', 'understanding', 'text', 'prize', 'more', 'enough', 'money', 'needs', 'Wadjda', 'studies', 'contest', 'Wadjda', 'never', 'really', 'digs', 'text', 'remembering', 'trying', 'win', 'not', 'really', 'learning', 'not', 'win', 'what', 'when', 'does/does', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'film.While', 'story', ""n't"", 'complicated', 'rather', 'straightforward', 'movie', 'hold', 'interest', 'start', 'finish', 'never', 'have', 'edge', 'seat', 'moment', 'here', 'find', 'caring', 'characters', 'Wadjda', 'mother', 'strict', 'enforcement', 'male', 'dominated', 'society', 'ever', 'present', 'hope', 'change', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'acts', 'eyes', 'young', 'Abdullah', 'not', 'only', 'want', 'Wadjda', 'win', 'want', 'see', 'bicycle', 'end', 'film.Much', 'been', 'noted', 'production', 'scenes', 'film', 'begin', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'country', 'films', 'sinful', 'especially', 'subject', 'content', 'top', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Haifaa', 'Al-Mansour', 'female', 'director', 'cast', 'crew', 'followed', 'custom', 'as', 'closely', 'possible', 'were', 'able', 'produce', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'all.Take', 'chance', 'open', 'up', 'door', 'new', 'experience', 'Allow', 'watch', 'least', 'one', 'foreign', 'film', 'open', 'mind', 'chance', 'see', 'world', 'have', 'chance', 'let', 'be', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'not', 'foreign', 'films', 'are', 'snobbish', 'elitist', 'just', 'tell', 'story', 'do', 'well', 'WADJDA', 'one']",Wadjda

The writer-director, Haifaa al-Mansour, has not only made a film that evokes some of the finest elements of Italian neorealism (just call it, &#34;The Bicycle Grief&#34;) but has, though indirectly and with great subtlety, fashioned a devastating critique of the lives of women under the oppressive Saudi regime. Wadjda, a ten year-old girl (Waad Mohammed) desires nothing more than a bicycle so that she can play along with her fellow male friends but discovers that such &#34;behavior&#34; is considered inappropriate for a girl. Although indifferent to religion (as are her parents), she enters a competition to memorize the Qu'ran in order to win enough money to purchase one on her own.Without necessarily spelling it out in capital letters, al-Mansour makes us live through the daily tribulations - and humiliations - that Wadjda and her mother (whose husband is leaving her to found a new family) endure. Similar to Marjane Satrapi's &#34;Persepolis&#34; (another great film), Wadjda and her mother have a modern sensibility but are trapped in a feudal world. Unlike &#34;Persepolis,&#34; which was clearly geared for Western audiences, &#34;Wadjda&#34; requires some patience as it confronts Saudi society in its unassuming way.

1638369,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00BU5YQQS,Paul Allaer,"[47, 50]","""Wadjda"" (2012 release from Saudi Arabia; 98 min.) brings the story of Wadjda, a young girl (I'm guessing 10 or 11 yr. old), an only child living with her mom in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Her dad is often absent due to work, and in addition we later learn he is considering taking a second wife who could bear him a son. Wadjda is a free spirit, wearing western style shoes and clothes and listening to 'evil music' (that would be Grouplove) on the radio. She is friends with a young boy who has a bike and it is her dream to get her own bike, so that she can race him and beat him. Alas, she cannot afford to buy a bike herself as is costs 800 Riyals. But as luck would have it, her school is holding a Koran competition where the winner will get 1,000 Riyals. To tell you more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first of all, the fact that this movie was made at all is nothing short of a small miracle (the first movie shot entirely in Saudi Arabia, a country where there are no movie theatres), and that it was directed by a woman (another first), Haifaa al-Mansour, is even more astonishing. Writer-director al-Mansour brings us a compassionate story of freedom (or the lack thereof) and what it means to grow up as a woman in Saudi Arabia. While of course a good part of the story focuses on the young girl, equally important (and biting) is what happens to her mother, who must rely on a driver to get her to her job (women aren't allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia) and who must try and charm/convince her husband not to seek a second wife (which is allowed under Saudi law). In fact, the movie screams ""suffocation"" and ""suppression"" from start to finish, just watch the multiple scenes at Wadjda's all-girls school (boys and girls are taught separately in Saudi), and even at home (where her mom reminds Wadjda to keep her voice down so as not to be heard outside by men since ""a woman's voice is her nakedness""). Wadjda's mom is exasperated that her daughter wants to get a bike, and tries everything to talk her out of it, including cautioning Wadjda that ""you won't be able to have kids if you ride a bike""... And maybe it's just me, but I find it unsettling to see women walk around in full ""abaya"", where at most only the eyes are visible, as if these women are the cause of all evil but men are free to do as they please. That said, this movie does provide a unique glimpse into what day-to-day live is really like in a place like Riyadh, and yet another reason to make this a must-see movie. The performances are generally top-notch, none more so than Waad Mohammed as the free-spirited young girl, but certainly Reem Abdullah as her mother is worth mentioning. Last but not least, the music for this movie, scored by Max Richter, is just beautiful (the soundtrack is available here on Amazon).I had seen the trailer for this movie a number of times and couldn't wait to see this. The movie finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati and I went to see it right away. I am happy to say that the screening where I saw this at was PACKED, which hopefully indicates a strong and lasting interest/demand for this movie. I see a LOT of movies and this movie is one of the best I've seen this year, period. If you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie that will open your horizons and along the way teach a few things about humanity, you cannot go wrong with this.

1638371,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B00BU5YQQS,Ranny Levy,"[1, 1]","A poignantly triumphant movie, the storyline of &#8220;WADJDA&#8221; is just as phenomenal as the story of how the film came to be. In short, &#8220;WADJDA&#8221; represents quite a number of firsts. It&#8217;s the first feature film shot entirely in Saudi Arabia, a country where cinema is prohibited. Writer and director Haifaa Al Mansour is Saudi Arabia&#8217;s first female filmmaker. It is also the first submission from Saudi Arabia for the Foreign Language Category for the 2014 Academy Awards.Set in a country known for its repression of women, the movie follows our title character&#8212;a 10-year-old spirited girl&#8212;in her journey to buy a new bicycle so she can race her best friend, neighbor and crush Abdullah. Even though Wadjda&#8217;s mother warns her to stay away from both bikes and boys because of their culture&#8217;s strict customs, Wadjda is determined to buy her bike with her own hard-earned money, no matter what the consequences. This, in turn, leads to joining a Koran competition at school. If she wins, she will have more than enough to buy a bike and therefore beat the boy next door.Subtly, the film explores the repercussions from this society in which girls should only be seen, not heard and, in public, only their eyes should be seen, with the rest of their faces covered by black veils. Wadjda tests boundaries in her search for freedom of expression. Although she discovers the contradictions in her world, she&#8217;s determined to challenge women&#8217;s traditional roles. The movie covers major topics such as polygamy and child-brides, as well as smaller oppressions such as the restriction of driving and rules of women in the presence of men.It&#8217;s mind-blowing to me that a movie about the oppression of women was made in the exact environment it depicts. On DVD, the making-of featurette explores in-depth the struggles and challenges that faced director Haifaa Al Mansour. The line, &#8220;respectable girls go inside,&#8221; is said to Wadjda in the film, and Mansour confronted the same problems. She had to direct her cast out-of-sight using a walkie-talkie to communicate with her cast and a monitor to watch the filming. She could not be seen working with men and often, when religious officials would come to inspect the bustle, production would be halted and moved to another location. It took close to five years to make the movie, but the effort is worth it.First timer Waad Mohammed is perfect as the fun-loving rebel Wadjda. This film is rated PG and I recommend it for ages 10 to 18. The pace may be slow for kids under ten. This is truly a landmark film that the world needs to watch. I give it five out of five stars. Perhaps the most uplifting message is that although the plot is fiction, the remarkable story behind the movie is not, and that shows that revolution is possible. This film played in theaters last year and will be released on February 11 on DVD/Blu-ray.Reviewed by KIDS FIRST!

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[4, 6]","First a quick note: Amazon combines all configurations of a film, whether in the theater, on BD or David or Streaming, so I always recommend that you sort reviews by Most Recent and then look at the date. This review is of the BD version being released on February 11, 2014This film was the first film to be submitted by Saudi Arabia for an Oscar. It was submitted but not nominated. I don&#8217;t know why but it&#8217;s won many film festival awards. It is the first film directed in Saudi Arabia by a woman &#8211; Haifaa Al Mansour &#8211; who also wrote the script.  Because of the religious customs in Saudi Arabia the director had to remain in a van as the film was made on location. And the only way she could get the funding was to go to a German production company.I&#8217;ll let you read the other reviews here to learn about the story &#8211; though I hop no one is giving &#8220;spoilers&#8221;  (I watched this film knowing virtually nothing other than seeing the trailer and knowing it was about a 10-year old girl who wanted a bicycle.) I would like to point out the significant Bonus Features which nearly double the content on the BD. If you have already seen the film in the theater I encourage you to get the BD to really appreciate the film you have seen.The first Bonus is a 33-minute &#8220;Making of&#8230;&#8221; featurette which contains lots of the location footage with comments by the German producer (in English) and the cast and writer/director (in Arabic with easy to read subtitles). It is interesting. Then comes the 38-minute Q&A; with Al Mansour at a session of the Director&#8217;s Guild of America. Al Mansour speaks perfect English so no subtitles are needed. These 38 minutes reveal the struggle to write, direct and cast the film and give more meaning to some of the scenes.There is also a full-length Director&#8217;s Commentary, but I have not had the time to watch that. It probably repeats much of what is discussed in the Q&A;, but it is there for those who want to immerse themselves more. And the Trailer is there as well.To my knowledge, none of the Special Features is available in the Instant Video version, so &#8211; again, I encourage you to get the Physical BD to really appreciate this small gem of a film.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",5,Review of Blu-ray &#8211; If you saw this beautiful film in theaters you&#8217;ll  want the BD for the &#8220;bonuses&#8221;,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,2365,"['First', 'quick', 'note', 'Amazon', 'configurations', 'film', 'theater', 'BD', 'David', 'Streaming', 'always', 'recommend', 'sort', 'reviews', 'Most', 'Recent', 'then', 'look', 'date', 'review', 'BD', 'version', 'being', 'released', 'February', '11', '2014This', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'be', 'submitted', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Oscar', 'was', 'submitted', 'not', 'nominated', 'don', '8217', 't', 'know', 'why', '8217', 'won', 'many', 'film', 'festival', 'awards', 'first', 'film', 'directed', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'woman', '8211', 'Haifaa', 'Al', 'Mansour', '8211', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'religious', 'customs', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'director', 'had', 'remain', 'van', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'location', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'get', 'funding', 'was', 'go', 'German', 'production', 'company.I', '8217', 'let', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'learn', 'story', '8211', 'hop', 'one', 'giving', '8220', 'spoilers', '8221', 'watched', 'film', 'knowing', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'other', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'knowing', 'was', '10-year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'wanted', 'bicycle', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'significant', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'nearly', 'double', 'content', 'BD', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'film', 'theater', 'encourage', 'get', 'BD', 'really', 'appreciate', 'film', 'have', 'seen.The', 'first', 'Bonus', '33-minute', '8220', 'Making', '8230', '8221', 'featurette', 'lots', 'location', 'footage', 'comments', 'German', 'producer', 'English', 'cast', 'writer/director', 'Arabic', 'easy', 'read', 'subtitles', 'interesting', 'Then', '38-minute', 'Q', 'A', 'Al', 'Mansour', 'session', 'Director', '8217', 'Guild', 'America', 'Al', 'Mansour', 'perfect', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'needed', '38', 'minutes', 'reveal', 'struggle', 'write', 'direct', 'cast', 'film', 'give', 'more', 'meaning', 'scenes.There', 'also', 'full-length', 'Director', '8217', 's', 'Commentary', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'time', 'watch', 'probably', 'much', 'what', 'discussed', 'Q', 'A', 'there', 'who', 'want', 'immerse', 'more', 'Trailer', 'there', 'well.To', 'knowledge', 'none', 'Special', 'Features', 'available', 'Instant', 'Video', 'version', 'so', '8211', 'again', 'encourage', 'get', 'Physical', 'BD', 'really', 'appreciate', 'small', 'gem', 'film.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', '8220', 'Anything', 'Phonographic', '8221']",Wadjda

It reminded me of some of the best films from other countries in Western Asia, like Iran and Turkey, more so the film The Day I Became a Woman by Marzieh Meshkini, where the bicycle is again seen as a vehicle of protest and freedom in a strict and oppressive society.Although Wadjda is a simple tale, it is extremely well made; its pace is superb, without a boring moment. Such comments fit a large number of films, so what makes this one stick out is the opportunity it offers us to have a look at a society which is notoriously secretive.The effect this look creates is one of extreme suffocation. The only point I want to make is related to this feeling of suffocation. In a certain respect this effect is similar to one created by the dystopian soft sci-fi films. These films are based on a what if premise: for example what if Britain was conquered by Germany in WW II as in the film It Happened Here or what if a society banned and burned all books as in Fahrenheit 451.However, the film that reminded me most was Never Let Me Go where a certain class of people is &#8216;cultivated&#8217; in order to provide donor organs for transplants to the &#8216;real&#8217; people. The most horrifying aspect of that film was the portrayal of the &#8216;donors&#8217; as mainly accepting this fate. They were educated to accept this as inevitable.The most worrying aspect of Wadjda is exactly Saudi girl education which aims to make them accept their fate (is that a comment for all education?). In the film, education seems to be successful as Saudi women have internalized their secondary status to a point where they have great difficulties in envisioning a different way of behaving. Thankfully the film is more positive than this implies, because in the person of Wadjda (and on a secondary level of a friend of her mother) we are offered hope that there is potential for change; perhaps not revolutionary but at least gradual willingness by women there to demand more rights.",5,An extraordinary film,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,2161,"['agree', 'everything', 'Paul', 'Allaer', 'review', 'will', 'not', 'repeat', 'plot', 'outline', '8211', 'essential', 'details', 'are', 'there.Wadjda', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'reminded', 'best', 'films', 'other', 'countries', 'Western', 'Asia', 'Iran', 'Turkey', 'more', 'so', 'film', 'Day', 'Became', 'Woman', 'Marzieh', 'Meshkini', 'where', 'bicycle', 'again', 'seen', 'vehicle', 'protest', 'freedom', 'strict', 'oppressive', 'society.Although', 'Wadjda', 'simple', 'tale', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'pace', 'superb', 'boring', 'moment', 'Such', 'comments', 'fit', 'large', 'number', 'films', 'what', 'one', 'stick', 'out', 'opportunity', 'have', 'look', 'society', 'notoriously', 'secretive.The', 'effect', 'look', 'one', 'extreme', 'suffocation', 'only', 'point', 'want', 'make', 'related', 'feeling', 'suffocation', 'certain', 'respect', 'effect', 'similar', 'one', 'created', 'dystopian', 'soft', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'films', 'are', 'based', 'what', 'premise', 'example', 'what', 'Britain', 'was', 'conquered', 'Germany', 'WW', 'II', 'film', 'Happened', 'Here', 'what', 'society', 'banned', 'burned', 'books', 'Fahrenheit', '451.However', 'film', 'reminded', 'most', 'was', 'Never', 'Let', 'Me', 'Go', 'where', 'certain', 'class', 'people', '8216', 'cultivated', '8217', 'order', 'provide', 'donor', 'organs', 'transplants', '8216', 'real', '8217', 'people', 'most', 'horrifying', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'portrayal', '8216', 'donors', '8217', 'mainly', 'accepting', 'fate', 'were', 'educated', 'accept', 'inevitable.The', 'most', 'worrying', 'aspect', 'Wadjda', 'exactly', 'Saudi', 'girl', 'education', 'make', 'accept', 'fate', 'comment', 'education', 'film', 'education', 'be', 'successful', 'Saudi', 'women', 'have', 'internalized', 'secondary', 'status', 'point', 'where', 'have', 'great', 'difficulties', 'envisioning', 'different', 'way', 'behaving', 'Thankfully', 'film', 'more', 'positive', 'implies', 'person', 'Wadjda', 'secondary', 'level', 'friend', 'mother', 'are', 'offered', 'hope', 'potential', 'change', 'perhaps', 'not', 'revolutionary', 'least', 'gradual', 'willingness', 'women', 'there', 'demand', 'more', 'rights']",Wadjda

Haiffa Al-Mansour is already accredited as being the first successful woman filmmaker in Saudi Arabia&#8217;s history.This is very much Al- Mansour&#8217;s film. She charms the viewer with the common everyday struggles of the Saudi woman, and rather than address the issues in a combative way, her approach is warm, even cute. This draws us into her characters and provides us with some heartfelt laughs along the way.The precocious 10-year Wadjda is growing up in Riyadh where she wants nothing more than a shiny new bicycle, but not only is she a little short on riyals, in Saudi Arabia women do not to ride bicycles. Saudi moral code bans woman from driving, going out in public unveiled, living unaccompanied, leaving the country alone, and opposing their husbands&#8217; orders in any way.Small details make grand impressions: In an all girls school teenage students paint their toenails, a sin, and are publicly vilified for it. The mere possibly that workmen half a mile away might see school girls playing in their courtyard forces all the girls to rush inside, lest they be judged impure. Pubescent girls are considered tainted and must use a tissue just to flip the pages of Koran.Wadjad&#8217;s truly beautiful mother spends much of her time perfecting her appearance only then to have to then cover herself with a full hijab. She is never openly defiant; defiance is impossible, but even thought she is obeying age old traditions that we&#8217;d assume would have dulled any emotional protest, through the mother&#8217;s submission we get a brief glimpse of her distress, the natural human emotional distress that no amount of &#8220;aged tradition&#8221; or religious subjugation has the right to inflict on any human being.In a country where cinemas are banned, Riyadh is not exactly a city where women can just go around shooting films. Females mixing with male co-workers would bring dire consequences. Al-Mansour shot the film anyway, directing much of it from the back of a van, and the result is a film representing the triumph of the defiant feminine spirit, in all forms.Get more at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",5,Saudi Film= Instantly Curious,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,2252,"['total', 'lack', 'films', 'come', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'make', 'Wadjda', 'Saudi', 'film', 'Haiffa', 'Al-Mansour', 'instantly', 'alluring', 'Haiffa', 'Al-Mansour', 'already', 'accredited', 'being', 'first', 'successful', 'woman', 'filmmaker', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', '8217', 's', 'history.This', 'very', 'much', 'Al-', 'Mansour', '8217', 's', 'film', 'viewer', 'common', 'everyday', 'struggles', 'Saudi', 'woman', 'rather', 'address', 'issues', 'combative', 'way', 'approach', 'warm', 'even', 'cute', 'characters', 'heartfelt', 'way.The', 'precocious', '10-year', 'Wadjda', 'growing', 'up', 'Riyadh', 'where', 'nothing', 'more', 'shiny', 'new', 'bicycle', 'not', 'only', 'little', 'short', 'riyals', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'women', 'do', 'not', 'ride', 'bicycles', 'Saudi', 'moral', 'code', 'bans', 'woman', 'driving', 'going', 'out', 'public', 'unveiled', 'living', 'unaccompanied', 'leaving', 'country', 'alone', 'opposing', 'husbands', '8217', 'orders', 'way.Small', 'details', 'make', 'grand', 'impressions', 'girls', 'school', 'teenage', 'students', 'paint', 'toenails', 'sin', 'are', 'publicly', 'vilified', 'mere', 'possibly', 'workmen', 'mile', 'away', 'might', 'see', 'school', 'girls', 'playing', 'courtyard', 'girls', 'rush', 'inside', 'lest', 'be', 'judged', 'impure', 'Pubescent', 'girls', 'are', 'considered', 'tainted', 'must', 'use', 'tissue', 'just', 'flip', 'pages', 'Koran.Wadjad', '8217', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'mother', 'much', 'time', 'perfecting', 'appearance', 'only', 'then', 'have', 'then', 'cover', 'full', 'hijab', 'never', 'openly', 'defiant', 'defiance', 'impossible', 'even', 'thought', 'obeying', 'age', 'old', 'traditions', '8217', 'd', 'assume', 'would', 'have', 'dulled', 'emotional', 'protest', 'mother', '8217', 's', 'submission', 'get', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'distress', 'natural', 'human', 'emotional', 'distress', 'amount', '8220', 'aged', 'tradition', '8221', 'religious', 'subjugation', 'right', 'inflict', 'human', 'being.In', 'country', 'where', 'cinemas', 'are', 'banned', 'Riyadh', 'not', 'exactly', 'city', 'where', 'women', 'can', 'just', 'go', 'around', 'shooting', 'films', 'Females', 'mixing', 'male', 'co-workers', 'would', 'bring', 'dire', 'consequences', 'Al-Mansour', 'shot', 'film', 'anyway', 'directing', 'much', 'back', 'van', 'result', 'film', 'representing', 'triumph', 'defiant', 'feminine', 'spirit', 'forms.Get', 'more', 'getthebonesaw.blogspot.com']",Wadjda

This however does not mean that this charming film is only for film critics. &#8220;Wadjda&#8221; has a few messages but the film is not preachy. The real strength of the film actually lies in the universal story of a young girl trying to reach for her dreams. And she is very adorable.Wadjda (Waad Mohammed) is an 11-year-old girl living with her mother in Riyadh. (Her father is away from home.) She is a smart and resourceful student of a school run by a strict headmaster. She likes chatting with Abdullah (Abdullrahman Algohani), an agreeable bicycle-riding boy living in her neighborhood. Wadjda also wants to buy a beautiful green-colored bike she &#8220;found&#8221; in a unique way. To save money for that, Wadjda takes part in a Qur'an recital contest.The main story itself is quite simple, perhaps deceptively so, but writer and director Haifaa al-Mansour (her first feature film) inserts several episodes that suggest what is going on in the community where the heroine lives. Wadjda&#8217;s mother has to commute in a van (driven by a not very nice driver) because women are not allowed to drive. Also, Wadja discovers that her (and all females&#8217;) name is not in the big family tree. What will she do?

1638386,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00BU5YQQS,Turfseer,"[10, 13]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0When it comes to women in Saudi Arabia, don't expect any gargantuan steps. Of course this is a society where women are not allowed to drive. So the release of Haifaa Al-Mansour's 'Wadjda', the first feature by a Saudi female director, should be considered groundbreaking. Given the constraints placed on women, it's amazing 'Wadja' was made at all; at times, director Al-Mansour was forced to direct the film via walkie-talkie from a van, as she was not permitted to mingle with men, while filming.But it's better to look at the film objectively and evaluate it like any other film as opposed to admiring it simply because it also represents a first-time, pioneering effort. The story is simple: Wadjda is a young girl who lives with her mother and attends an all-girls state-run school. The father is usually not at home, having given up on his wife who has not produced a son, and now may be searching for a second wife, much to Wadjda's mother's chagrin.Wadjda befriends a bicycle-riding boy, Abdullah, and her goal is to best him in a bicycle race. All she has to do is come up with the cash to purchase a bicycle at a local store. She finally has a chance of realizing her dream by earning the top prize in a Koran-reading contest at school.'Wadjda' is on solid ground as a critique of Saudi society's treatment of women. Reem Abdullah as Wadjda's mother steals the show as a woman constantly placed in untenable situations. When we're first introduced to her, she is dependent on a male driver, who she depends on to drive her a long distance to her job. The driver eventually declines to transport her anymore as he claims the mother is always late, and it takes a little trickery on the part of Wadjda and Abdullah to get him to change his mind (Abdullah pretends that he has an 'uncle' who can get him deported as apparently the driver is not a Saudi citizen).Much worse than the situation with the driver, is Wadjda's mother's status in the home. When faced with the prospect of her husband taking a second wife, she pleads, ""I'm the original brand, why are you leaving for an imitation?"" The mother is a nuanced character as she also has a conservative, insular outlook, typical of most people in Saudi society. She criticizes a friend who has taken a job at a hospital, where she greets people without wearing a scarf to hide her face. And when Wadjda asks whether it's okay that Abdullah use their roof to hang up some wire across a courtyard to promote his uncle's election campaign, she refuses with the close-minded retort that Abdullah's relatives did not belong to their family's 'tribe'.Wadjda's school is also a hotbed of sedition amongst the young girl and teenagers who attend there. Wadjda's protest takes the form of wearing sneakers as opposed to the standard issue shoes the girls are supposed to wear. Wadjda keeps quiet when two older girls are accused of forbidden activities including reading women's magazines, putting on makeup and drawing tattoos on their ankles as well as some chaste meetings with boys and even fraternizing among themselves in too friendly a manner. The school is run with an iron hand by the hypocritical Miss Hussa, who is rumored to have had an affair with a man but warms up to Wadjda when she decides to enter the Koran-reading contest.When Wadjda wins the contest, it didn't make a lot of sense that she confesses she's planning to buy the bicycle with the prize money as the end result is that Miss Hussa reneges on the offer and instead, donates the money for Palestinian aid (in reality, Wadjda's smart enough not to act so dumb if she wants to get what she wants).As a symbol of revolt against a strict patriarchal society, Wadjda fits the bill as a spunky mouthpiece. But as a fully realized character, Kenneth Tynan of the LA Times gets it right when he questions the character's credibility: ""It also doesn't help that Wadjda herself is a clich&eacute; rebel, a headstrong, borderline bratty type whose smart-mouth attitude is supposed to charm us with its spunk but can also irritate by its rudeness. A little of this goes a long way, especially in a film that has such a leisurely pace.""The climax to 'Wadjda' is heartfelt, as Wadjda's mom finally decides to join the 'revolution' and purchases the wonderful present for her daughter. But what exactly has the 'revolution' accomplished? Wadjda leaves Abdullah in the dust when they race one another, but what will become of Wadjda in a few years? Married off to a man and perhaps cast off for a second wife, just like her mother? Wadjda's defiance may be tempered in the future, but at least her actions represent a triumph over complacency. I guess in Saudi Arabia, we should be happy for baby steps and thankful that the film was made at all!",3,First-time Saudi female director's 'baby steps' for women's rights represent gargantuan steps over there,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,4824,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Rating', '3.5', '5.0When', 'women', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'gargantuan', 'steps', 'course', 'society', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'drive', 'release', 'Haifaa', 'Al-Mansour', ""'Wadjda"", 'first', 'feature', 'Saudi', 'female', 'director', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'groundbreaking', 'Given', 'constraints', 'placed', 'women', 'amazing', ""'Wadja"", 'was', 'made', 'times', 'director', 'Al-Mansour', 'was', 'forced', 'direct', 'film', 'walkie-talkie', 'van', 'was', 'not', 'permitted', 'mingle', 'men', 'filming.But', 'better', 'look', 'film', 'objectively', 'evaluate', 'other', 'film', 'opposed', 'admiring', 'simply', 'also', 'first-time', 'pioneering', 'effort', 'story', 'simple', 'Wadjda', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'mother', 'all-girls', 'state-run', 'school', 'father', 'usually', 'not', 'home', 'having', 'given', 'up', 'wife', 'who', 'not', 'produced', 'son', 'now', 'may', 'be', 'searching', 'second', 'wife', 'much', 'Wadjda', 'mother', 'chagrin.Wadjda', 'bicycle-riding', 'boy', 'Abdullah', 'goal', 'best', 'bicycle', 'race', 'do', 'come', 'cash', 'purchase', 'bicycle', 'local', 'store', 'finally', 'chance', 'realizing', 'dream', 'earning', 'top', 'prize', 'Koran-reading', 'contest', 'school', 'solid', 'ground', 'critique', 'Saudi', 'society', 'treatment', 'women', 'Reem', 'Abdullah', 'Wadjda', 'mother', 'show', 'woman', 'constantly', 'placed', 'untenable', 'situations', 'When', ""'re"", 'first', 'introduced', 'dependent', 'male', 'driver', 'who', 'drive', 'long', 'distance', 'job', 'driver', 'eventually', 'transport', 'anymore', 'mother', 'always', 'late', 'little', 'trickery', 'part', 'Wadjda', 'Abdullah', 'get', 'change', 'mind', 'Abdullah', ""'uncle"", 'who', 'can', 'get', 'deported', 'apparently', 'driver', 'not', 'Saudi', 'citizen', 'worse', 'situation', 'driver', 'Wadjda', 'mother', 'status', 'home', 'When', 'faced', 'prospect', 'husband', 'taking', 'second', 'wife', ""'m"", 'original', 'brand', 'why', 'are', 'leaving', 'imitation', 'mother', 'nuanced', 'character', 'also', 'conservative', 'insular', 'outlook', 'typical', 'most', 'people', 'Saudi', 'society', 'friend', 'who', 'taken', 'job', 'hospital', 'where', 'people', 'wearing', 'scarf', 'hide', 'face', 'when', 'Wadjda', 'okay', 'Abdullah', 'use', 'roof', 'hang', 'up', 'wire', 'courtyard', 'promote', 'uncle', 'election', 'campaign', 'close-minded', 'retort', 'Abdullah', 'relatives', 'did', 'not', 'belong', 'family', ""'tribe'.Wadjda"", 'school', 'also', 'hotbed', 'sedition', 'young', 'girl', 'teenagers', 'who', 'attend', 'there', 'Wadjda', 'protest', 'form', 'wearing', 'sneakers', 'opposed', 'standard', 'issue', 'girls', 'are', 'supposed', 'wear', 'Wadjda', 'quiet', 'when', 'two', 'older', 'girls', 'are', 'accused', 'forbidden', 'activities', 'including', 'reading', 'women', 'magazines', 'putting', 'makeup', 'drawing', 'tattoos', 'ankles', 'as', 'well', 'chaste', 'meetings', 'boys', 'even', 'fraternizing', 'too', 'friendly', 'manner', 'school', 'run', 'iron', 'hand', 'hypocritical', 'Miss', 'Hussa', 'who', 'rumored', 'have', 'had', 'affair', 'man', 'up', 'Wadjda', 'when', 'enter', 'Koran-reading', 'contest.When', 'Wadjda', 'contest', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'planning', 'buy', 'bicycle', 'prize', 'money', 'end', 'result', 'Miss', 'Hussa', 'offer', 'instead', 'money', 'Palestinian', 'aid', 'reality', 'Wadjda', 'smart', 'enough', 'not', 'act', 'so', 'dumb', 'get', 'what', '.As', 'symbol', 'revolt', 'strict', 'patriarchal', 'society', 'Wadjda', 'bill', 'spunky', 'mouthpiece', 'fully', 'realized', 'character', 'Kenneth', 'Tynan', 'LA', 'Times', 'right', 'when', 'questions', 'character', 'credibility', 'also', ""n't"", 'help', 'Wadjda', 'clich', 'eacute', 'rebel', 'headstrong', 'borderline', 'bratty', 'type', 'smart-mouth', 'attitude', 'supposed', 'charm', 'spunk', 'can', 'also', 'irritate', 'rudeness', 'little', 'long', 'way', 'especially', 'film', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'climax', ""'Wadjda"", 'heartfelt', 'Wadjda', 'mom', 'finally', 'join', ""'revolution"", 'purchases', 'wonderful', 'present', 'daughter', 'what', 'exactly', ""'revolution"", 'accomplished', 'Wadjda', 'Abdullah', 'dust', 'when', 'race', 'one', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'Wadjda', 'few', 'years', 'Married', 'man', 'perhaps', 'cast', 'off', 'second', 'wife', 'just', 'mother', 'Wadjda', 'defiance', 'may', 'be', 'tempered', 'future', 'least', 'actions', 'represent', 'triumph', 'complacency', 'guess', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'should', 'be', 'happy', 'baby', 'steps', 'thankful', 'film', 'was', 'made']",Wadjda

The story is pleasant and well done, and other reviewers have covered it well. What interested me most was to see what life is really like in Saudi Arabia.I knew that women live western lives inside their homes and wear the veil outside it, but to see the degree of oppression with one's own eyes was chilling. I was especially surprised by the poor living conditions. They're typical for many Arab countries but I had assumed that Saudi Arabia has a much higher standard of living, especially since the women are trapped inside their home when not at work. I pictures luxurious courtyards. Nothing could be farther from the truth, making their subjugation all the more depressing.I kept wondering why don't all those educated, spunky and capable women simply up and leave. I know that some travel and study abroad. Why anyone would return to such a country (which I assume they do otherwise no one would be permitted to leave even to study) is beyond me.The film didn't show the really big horrors - the public decapitations, lashings, imprisonment of women when are raped. That the film was made at all, showing even the 'small' horrors, is a huge surprise.One also wonders why Saudi men put up with this. How much fun is it to live in a segregated society where you mingle only with men or subordinates?Good movie on its own terms and a must see for the look into a forbidden culture.",4,A peek into Saudi Arabia,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,1475,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'mostly', 'opportunity', 'take', 'look', ""'iron"", 'curtain', 'story', 'pleasant', 'well', 'done', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'covered', 'well', 'What', 'interested', 'most', 'was', 'see', 'what', 'life', 'really', 'like', 'Saudi', 'Arabia.I', 'knew', 'women', 'live', 'western', 'lives', 'homes', 'wear', 'veil', 'see', 'degree', 'oppression', 'one', 'own', 'eyes', 'was', 'chilling', 'was', 'especially', 'surprised', 'poor', 'living', 'conditions', ""'re"", 'typical', 'many', 'Arab', 'countries', 'had', 'assumed', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'much', 'higher', 'standard', 'living', 'especially', 'women', 'are', 'trapped', 'home', 'when', 'not', 'work', 'pictures', 'luxurious', 'courtyards', 'Nothing', 'could', 'be', 'farther', 'truth', 'making', 'subjugation', 'more', 'depressing.I', 'kept', 'wondering', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'all', 'educated', 'spunky', 'capable', 'women', 'simply', 'leave', 'know', 'travel', 'study', 'abroad', 'Why', 'anyone', 'would', 'return', 'country', 'assume', 'do', 'otherwise', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'permitted', 'leave', 'even', 'study', 'me.The', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'really', 'big', 'horrors', 'public', 'decapitations', 'lashings', 'imprisonment', 'women', 'when', 'are', 'raped', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'showing', 'even', ""'small"", 'horrors', 'huge', 'surprise.One', 'also', 'why', 'Saudi', 'men', 'put', 'up', 'How', 'much', 'fun', 'live', 'segregated', 'society', 'where', 'mingle', 'only', 'men', 'subordinates', 'Good', 'movie', 'own', 'terms', 'must', 'see', 'look', 'forbidden', 'culture']",Wadjda
