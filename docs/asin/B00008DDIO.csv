With a focus on the environment and human nature this anime tells the story of a young girl awakening and becoming more conscious.  I thought this story would just be another fluffy mindless anime like I normally watch (yes, I like the mindless ones too).  To my shock and pleasant surprise I found the commentary on our society to be blunt and extremely accurate.  The author clearly spent a lot of time researching the issues to present human nature and nature itself with more precision than most activists programs.  This anime will definitely give you something to think about.  A must own whether you like anime or not.  Frankly, this should be mandatory viewing for all humans!

The names attached to the project alone make this a high profile project. Yokko Kanno (RahXephon, Cowboy Bebop) on music duties and Shoji Kawamori (creator of Escaflowne)directs however the overall project is so poorly executed that you can't help but feel the ecological message is at best preachy.The basic plot surrounds a young girl who is near death after an accident but is given a second chance at life if she agrees to become the Avatar of Time. She agrees and goes on to fight ecological creatures until all of Japan is ultimately an ecological disaster and the fate of the world hinges on her decisions.The animation is stunning and the music top-notch but the show just seemed to be a Japanese take on American kids show Captain planet. I was particularly annoyed by a scene in which toxins in the food served at ""American burger"" nearly poison and kill the two main characters. It just seemed rather narrow minded and stereotypical to have the restaraunt serving polluted food as a thinly disguised McDonalds.Overall, Arjuna was pretty animation but the story was so annoying that the message of conserving and preservation was lost in high handed dialogue and Anime magic girl cliches.

738384,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00008DDIO,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 6]","When it comes to ecology and the environment, it's usually a topic that some people welcome and a topic that many people know about but really don't want to get involved in.And I suspect that when you have a top tier anime director/creator Kawamori Shoji (""Visions of Escaflowne"", ""Super Dimension Century Macross"", ""Macross Plus"", ""Macross 7', ""Macross Zero"" and ""Macross Frontiere"" to name a few) and composer Kanno Yoko, theme song by Sakamoto Maaya and character designs by Kishida Takahiro (""Tenchi Muyou"", ""El Hazard"", ""Heat Guy J"" to name a few), you expect to have a quality anime series.The 13-episode TV series that aired on TV Tokyo back in 2001 received a DVD release in the US back in 2002 and for so long I have wanted to watch this series.The anime series is primarily about a teenager named Ariyoshi Juna.  Your typical high school girl learning archery and spending time with boyfriend Oshima Tokio.With her skills at archery training not going as well, she tells her boyfriend that she wants to see the sea.  Tokio, being so in love with Juna, decides to take her to the sea via motorcycle and everything seems well until an entity flashes in front of them and in the process, both are thrown of the motorcycle.Juna is rushed to the hospital and she pretty much is dead.  That is until she hears a voice of Chris Hawken (a powerful entity)  who tells her that he will give her life back if she saves the world.  Juna is given a glimpse of the Planet Earth, especially Japan in terrible shape with drought, famine and more.  Not wanting to leave her mother and Tokio behind, Juna agrees and is given her life back.All of a sudden, while Tokio and her mother are pretty much saying goodbye to Juna, Juna awakes and runs up to the hospital roof and there she is met by some secret organization known as S.E.E.D.It appears that Juna has a special power to turn into Earth Maiden Arjuna and able to see these monstrous worm-like entities known as Raaja (which are literally Earth's bacteria).  Arjuna thinks her job is to use her powers to fight the Raaja but Chris keeps giving her messages of ""why do you want to kill?"", ""What are you trying to do?"" and Juna really doesn' t know what her job truly is.Throughout the whole series, we start learning a lot about ecology, organic food and how there is a cycle of everything that we use and eat but because of pesticides and pollution, our Earth is being hurt by it.In one episode, Juna and Tokio stay at a farm and learn from a farmer about organic vegetables.  Juna and Tokio not knowing why people would want to eat vegetables that have been eaten by bugs.  Also, being taught that pesticides hurt the system.  Because there is a cycle to food.  The bugs, the worms undergorund, the soil, everything has its purpose.And from that point, we see Juna becoming more of a vegetarian and just can't eat regular food without having images.  For example, Tokio tries to get her to eat at a fast food restaurant Merikan Burger and images of the cows just make her sick.She now lives a lifestyle of wanting to protect the environment, eating the right food but yet everyone around her doesn't understand why.  They don't like being preached about the environment, especially from her.So, literally her relationship with her family and with her boyfriend Tokio is being tested.  And her best friend Shirakawa Sayuri seems to be getting closer to Tokio because her involvement with S.E.E.D. and her enviromental perspective is dampening her relationship with everyone she's close with.So, for the first eleven episodes, we see as Arjuna comes into contact with the Raaja and Kawamori finds ways to get his message out to viewers on ecology, protecting the environment and how industrial pollution and pesticides and a variety of other things happening in today's world is really hurting the environment and if people don't change their ways, it will be too late.Throughout the series, we meet other characters.  The major player outside of Juna and Tokio is the other person with spirital power, Chris Hawken who is literally dying since he gave part of his life to revive Arjuna.  He can't talk and communicates through a young telepath named Cindy.  Cindy despises Juna maily because Chris tries to get close to her and Cindy really cares for him.  When Juna screws up, Chris is there to try to help in his weakened state but there is only so much he can do.  But he tries to help Juna become aware of why she was chosen and why things are happening to the planet.And in the final episodes, that is what happens.  The city of Tokyo has now been invaded by the Raaja, water and food and anything that is absorbed by the Raaja is affected and people now are dying.The series is a mix of sci-fi mecha, sci-fi bishojou magical girl and your typical high school love triangle all together in one series.  The ""mecha"" in this series is mainly a protector of Arjuna who shows up to make sure she is not killed.  The ""magic girl"" part in this series is what Juna can transform into. She can fly and as a weapon, use a specialized bow and arrow to fend off attacks.  And of course, the high school drama is between her, Tokio and Sayuri.  And of course, there is other drama such as Juna's relationship to her mother and sister, her teacher and of course with Chris and Cindy and other members of S.E.E.D.VIDEO:As for the video, I enjoy anime series that show a large variety of scenery.  This is anime features the city, a farming area and various locations that I really enjoy that and it really pushes the staff to create so much scenery and beautifu backgrounds and animation and all in all, I really enjoyed the animation.  Granted it was created in 2001 but nevertheless, in 2008, I enjoyed it very much.AUDIO:I watched this series both in Japanese and English.  I enjoyed the Japanese version and found Higashiyama Mami's acting as Arjuna and Seki Tomokazu's voice acting as Tokio to be really well done.  But I soon discovered that I really do enjoy the English dub voice acting which I felt was done very well.  Maggie Blue O'Hara and Andrew Francis did a great job with their voice acting as the couple and everyone else as well.  So, both languages are just exceptional.SPECIAL FEATURES:Special features include interviews with Kawamori Shoji, the cast and an Arjuna dictionary.  Also, music videos.Just an interesting note that ""ARJUNA"" features different ending themes and so after each episode, you more than often get a different ending theme which I found interesting.  Also, a live ending that was reminiscent of the bubbly ""Kare Kano"" but actually featuring a school girl running into the sunset.For me, it was a plus to get a series from Kawamori Shoji that was not ""Macross"" related but even moreso, an anime series that would tackle on ecology and various topics within the scope of environment but also a few other things which I don't want to spoil for the viewer.The series does get preachy and remember those after-school specials that were shown on TV trying to let people know about a wide range of topics from racism, ecology or something to catch your interest and make you think.This is an anime series that does just that.  There is a message that Kawamori wanted to get through and even in the anime series, a message of, if one can make a change, possibly that one can make others change.Reading the various reviews on the Internet, I can see why this anime series is loved and hated.  No one likes things being driven down their throat but on the other hand, for those who are open to hearing out another perspective, then it's fine.For me, I try to do my part for the environment but I'm not as hardcore as Juna.  I have no qualms eating my Boca or Veggie burgers, recycling, purchasing organic vegetables and being considerate of the environment but at the same time, I have no qualms of going to Burger King and ordering a double cheeseburger as well.But Kawamori's message did reach out to me and this series did give me a good understanding about pesticides and for me, I enjoy learning new things and open to hearing other perspectives.So, I enjoyed the series for that.  I also enjoyed that twist of, ""OK, we warned you that there will be problems if you don't change your lifestyle"" and where people think it won't be in their lifetime, in this series, problems happen immediately and destruction and chaos comes.Granted, when we see news about the melting glaciers, drilling for oil in the ocean because of escalating gas prices and the hole in the ozone layer, how does one feel about those topics?  Passionate, bored, interested or don't care?So, that is where ""ARJUNA"" as a series is being interpreted by anime viewers.  You either love it or hate it.  And you either care about the message or look at it as a pathetic attempt to a person's beliefs being driven down your throat.For me, I enjoyed the series.  It was a great blend of sci-fi, love triangles and bishojo heroines.  But of course, the main thing about this series is indeed the message of making a change in your life and accepting of what is happening in this world.  You either get it or you don't.  You either welcome that message or you don't.So, by saying that...if you are open to Kawamori's message on the environment through a series like ""ARJUNA"", check it out.  If you are the last person who cares about hearing details on the environment, this anime series is definitely not for you.",4,You love it or you hate it!

738385,A2W4BX2P3AKDIC,B00008DDIO,K McK,"[1, 1]","Ok, so this is a message movie, which should be blatantly obvious to anybody who watches it, even if they're only 8 years old. The plot is only a very thin veil over the various messages of the show. The plot itself - the part that's not just a veil for messages - is pretty good, the characters are ok (although they're really little more than spokespeople)... but this anime falls prey to a very huge flaw: there are too many messages. There are, in fact, something like 20 different messages in this show, ranging from, ""communication is good,"" to ""we are all the same,"" to ""all modern civilization is evil.""Most message shows stick to communicating one or two morals, for really good reason. Any more than that, and not only does the show become confusing (""So, what am I supposed to be learning THIS episode?"") but it also becomes self-defeating. If the viewer disagrees with even one of those messages, they will disagree with the whole thing; part of human nature is that, if a person disagrees with Point A, and Point B is associated with Point A, then that person will also disagree with Point B.

The result is a complete loss of the country's support systems.  Juna is stranded in New York City while her friends Tokio and Sayuri struggle for survival with no food, surrounded by the pollution released in the crisis.Facing opposition from those who would prefer to see Japan quarantined and its people abandoned Jun rebels, and uses her powers to return to her home in full battle array.  About to forcibly cleanse Japan, Juna finds herself facing an unexpected opponent.  In the midst of her heroic effort she must confront a spiritual crisis that will change her forever.Throughout this series there has been a tension between Shoji Kawamori's educational intentions and the flow of the story line.  While the moments of ecological explanation are well done, they are a bit too pedantic for this watcher, perhaps because I have heard these lessons before.  But the lessons are important, and the story line weaves these pieces together and provides a spiritual context as well.  In these last two episodes, everything comes together and a compelling message is delivered perfectly.This is a series that is perfect for its intended audience, those aged 13 and up.  It depicts the typical problems of teenagers growing up in a flawed world with candor and honesty.  It presumes that the watcher is comfortable with the minimal content present, which is completely innocuous when compared to what occurs in a typical TV advertisement.Arjuna's message, to demonstrate the interconnectedness of all life is one that truly needs to be taught - repeatedly.  This is a good family series that can provide the material for some excellent discussions.

The animation is pretty amazing especially when they combine some of the CGI and Animation together - specifically scenes with vehicles. The only CGI that doesn't fit is the large ""super robot"" that appears every so often. The plot of the 13 episodes is basically taking care of the environment before it comes back to haunt you. There are a lot of good themes here, but it can really get bogged down and boring. The heroine of the story is a girl who has mystical powers giving to her after she dies and is brought back to life. I would say out of the 13 epsiodes 7 of them include action sequences the rest is on environmental issues and how we can stop pollution and eat better. The extras are okay.

Arjuna at 1st glance you can obviously tell its beautifully animated and the cg is great. What you don't get to see though is the excellent music done by none other than Yokko Kanno which for the anime beginners out there is the same person responsible for Macross Plus, Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, and Wolf's Rain (of course Arjuna!). Which also means the music is excellent it fits perfectly I found no flaws with the music at all. The storyline on the other hand is very complex and not for children who don't understand the complexities of everyday people who don't even notice everything they are doing to harm the Earth. This storyline is not for kids because there are some graphic images (whether you agree with me or not) of children starving to death, animals dieing, and other things I don't want to get into because it may ruin the story line. The other side to Arjuna though is the love story between Juna and Tokio her boyfriend.
