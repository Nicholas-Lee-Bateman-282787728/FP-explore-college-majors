664852,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B00005M209,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[3, 7]","Here's an example of Lucio Fulci at his worst. Just so you know right up front, this film is actually pasted together from bits out of other movies! The story tells of a troubled film director who finds that the gory scenes he creates in his movies seem to be acted out in real life. Is he going mad or is there some supernatural element at work? If you waste your time watching this, the chances are you won't even care.To make up most of the running time, unrelated and disparate scenes of gore and murder have been spliced in from several of Fulci's other films made at around this time. For this reason, the film appears to make no sense at all. It's like some very lazy clips show. All the films that the clips are taken from were unsuccessful on release...maybe they thought nobody would notice! There's no attempt made to help the viewer identify which scenes are real and which are fantasy. And although in some movies that works very well (""Images"" is a good example), you have to be a very skilled director to pull it off, but Fulci is not capable of building any kind of atmosphere except one of confusion. He also takes the lead role as the troubled director..sadly his acting skills are nothing to write home about either.Only appealing to absolute hard-core Fulci enthusiasts, this movie is an insult to any serious or even casual horror buff. Save your money and give this a wide berth.",2,Very Poor,1237248000,"03 17, 2009",2009,1401,"['Here', 'example', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'worst', 'Just', 'know', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'film', 'actually', 'pasted', 'together', 'bits', 'other', 'movies', 'story', 'tells', 'troubled', 'film', 'director', 'who', 'gory', 'scenes', 'movies', 'seem', 'be', 'acted', 'out', 'real', 'life', 'going', 'mad', 'there', 'supernatural', 'element', 'work', 'waste', 'time', 'watching', 'chances', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'care.To', 'make', 'up', 'most', 'running', 'time', 'unrelated', 'disparate', 'scenes', 'gore', 'murder', 'have', 'been', 'spliced', 'several', 'Fulci', 'other', 'films', 'made', 'time', 'reason', 'film', 'make', 'sense', 'very', 'lazy', 'clips', 'show', 'films', 'clips', 'are', 'taken', 'were', 'unsuccessful', 'release', 'maybe', 'thought', 'nobody', 'would', 'notice', 'attempt', 'made', 'help', 'viewer', 'identify', 'scenes', 'are', 'real', 'are', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'very', 'well', 'Images', 'good', 'example', 'have', 'be', 'very', 'skilled', 'director', 'pull', 'off', 'Fulci', 'not', 'capable', 'building', 'kind', 'atmosphere', 'one', 'confusion', 'also', 'lead', 'role', 'troubled', 'director..sadly', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'either.Only', 'appealing', 'absolute', 'hard-core', 'Fulci', 'enthusiasts', 'movie', 'insult', 'serious', 'even', 'casual', 'horror', 'buff', 'Save', 'money', 'give', 'wide', 'berth']",A Cat in the Brain

The first 2,500 copies have a lenticular cover which appears to have already dried up from most online stores.Fulci fans you need to pick this release up for the rare extras even if you are not a fan of the film. Some of the extras are Fulci's rare first and only US horror convention visit at the 1996 Fangoria Weekend of Horrors, which is a real treat for horror fans such as myself who never got this on a nth generation bootleg. The is also a short hidden extra showing Fulci signing autographs on disc one, just select the eyeball in the extras menu on disc 1. Disc 2 has some in depth interviews with Lucio Fulci and Brett Halsey as well as 3 very short talks with some actors from Cat in the Brain remembering Fulci. Also on the second disc are the biographies and filmographies for Lucio Fulci and Brett Halsey. Lastly you also get a booklet with linear notes from Lucio's daughter Antonella, Eli Roth, and writer David J. Schow. All in all for such a obscure film, this DVD is absolutely loaded with extra material.The film itself is oddly enough a self reflection/parody for Lucio and is about himself as a director being driven to madness because of the violent imagery in his films. The murders of his films start happening off the screen and Lucio gradually starts to believe it's his fault people are dying. It's an entertaining film and definitely worth a viewing if you're familiar with some of Fulci's work. If you've never seen a Fulci film before I recommend seeing his 2 most popular fan films Zombie and The Beyond first just to get a feel for his work.Pick this one up and support Grindhouse, they have done an outstanding job on Cat in the Brain's first official Region 1 US release.",4,Extras alone are a significant enough reason to own Cat in the Brain,1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,1789,"['Based', 'extras', 'alone', 'release', 'single', 'Fulci', 'fan', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'first', '2,500', 'copies', 'have', 'lenticular', 'cover', 'have', 'already', 'dried', 'up', 'most', 'online', 'stores.Fulci', 'fans', 'need', 'pick', 'release', 'up', 'rare', 'extras', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'film', 'extras', 'are', 'Fulci', 'rare', 'first', 'only', 'US', 'horror', 'convention', 'visit', '1996', 'Fangoria', 'Weekend', 'Horrors', 'real', 'treat', 'horror', 'fans', 'such', 'myself', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'nth', 'generation', 'bootleg', 'also', 'short', 'hidden', 'extra', 'showing', 'Fulci', 'signing', 'autographs', 'disc', 'one', 'just', 'select', 'eyeball', 'extras', 'menu', 'disc', '1', 'Disc', '2', 'depth', 'interviews', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'Brett', 'Halsey', 'as', 'well', '3', 'very', 'short', 'talks', 'actors', 'Cat', 'Brain', 'remembering', 'Fulci', 'Also', 'second', 'disc', 'are', 'biographies', 'filmographies', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'Brett', 'Halsey', 'Lastly', 'also', 'get', 'booklet', 'linear', 'notes', 'Lucio', 'daughter', 'Antonella', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'writer', 'David', 'J.', 'Schow', 'obscure', 'film', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'loaded', 'extra', 'material.The', 'film', 'oddly', 'enough', 'self', 'reflection/parody', 'Lucio', 'about', 'director', 'being', 'driven', 'madness', 'violent', 'imagery', 'films', 'murders', 'films', 'start', 'happening', 'off', 'screen', 'Lucio', 'gradually', 'believe', 'fault', 'people', 'are', 'dying', 'entertaining', 'film', 'definitely', 'viewing', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Fulci', 'work', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Fulci', 'film', 'recommend', 'seeing', '2', 'most', 'popular', 'fan', 'films', 'Zombie', 'Beyond', 'first', 'just', 'get', 'feel', 'work.Pick', 'one', 'up', 'support', 'Grindhouse', 'have', 'done', 'outstanding', 'job', 'Cat', 'Brain', 'first', 'official', 'Region', '1', 'US', 'release']",A Cat in the Brain
664854,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B00005M209,Anton Ilinski,"[3, 5]","I can see why ""Cat in the Brain"" is so expensive at Amazon - it was released about 17 years ago and still hasn't got a decent DVD re-release by Anchor Bay or whoever. And that's a mystery to me because it's one of the greatest Lucio Fulci films. Certainly it's not like his classic works of the late 70s and early 80s, nothing like ""The Beyond"", ""The New-York Ripper"" or ""House by the Cemetery"". But it still delivers the usual Fulci goods. The director plays himself - a horror movie-director who's being stalked by some lunatic and meanwhile suffers from brutal and bizarre hallucinations.Although the film has rather an ambiguous plot and multiple meanings, it still remains an exploitation feature like many others of Lucio Fulci. And you may search those meanings recalling Oscar Wilde's quote about life imitating art, but still... ""Cat in the Brain"" is interesting primarily because of its cheesy content.I remember watching this film in the beginning of the 90s on VHS and I was pretty amazed about how much it was unlike most of the usual American slashers and chillers. ""Cat in the Brain"" started with a guy chainsawing a naked woman lying on the table, then hashing her parts in a meat-grinder and finally feeding the mincemeat to the cats. I couldn't recall any other movie that was as much explicit and graphic. And all this stuff were made with a master shot, all the details of the woman's anatomy and chainsawing quite visible.So if you enjoy this kind of violent cinema, you'll definately like this one - and it's full of likes of the above-mentioned scene, stabbing, gore, Nazi-uniform orgies etc. What else can attract exploitation films' lovers? And if you like previous Fulci's works, I'm sure you'll like ""Cat on the Brain"" too. You can still see Maestro's hand here, it's just that Lucio achieved some new level with this film. A new level of brutality maybe or a new level of sense - it's for you to decide.And I still hope we'll see a nice DVD release of this outstanding movie.",4,GOOD OLD FULCI,1153699200,"07 24, 2006",2006,2003,"['can', 'see', 'why', 'Cat', 'Brain', 'so', 'expensive', 'Amazon', 'was', 'released', '17', 'years', 'ago', 'still', ""n't"", 'got', 'decent', 'DVD', 're-release', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'whoever', 'mystery', 'one', 'greatest', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'films', 'Certainly', 'not', 'classic', 'works', 'late', '70s', 'early', '80s', 'nothing', 'Beyond', 'New-York', 'Ripper', 'House', 'Cemetery', 'still', 'usual', 'Fulci', 'goods', 'director', 'horror', 'movie-director', 'who', 'being', 'stalked', 'lunatic', 'meanwhile', 'suffers', 'brutal', 'bizarre', 'film', 'rather', 'ambiguous', 'plot', 'multiple', 'meanings', 'still', 'exploitation', 'feature', 'many', 'others', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'may', 'search', 'meanings', 'recalling', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'quote', 'life', 'imitating', 'art', 'still', 'Cat', 'Brain', 'interesting', 'primarily', 'cheesy', 'content.I', 'remember', 'watching', 'film', 'beginning', '90s', 'VHS', 'was', 'pretty', 'amazed', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'most', 'usual', 'American', 'slashers', 'chillers', 'Cat', 'Brain', 'started', 'guy', 'chainsawing', 'naked', 'woman', 'lying', 'table', 'then', 'hashing', 'parts', 'meat-grinder', 'finally', 'feeding', 'mincemeat', 'cats', 'could', ""n't"", 'recall', 'other', 'movie', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'explicit', 'graphic', 'stuff', 'were', 'made', 'master', 'shot', 'details', 'woman', 'anatomy', 'chainsawing', 'quite', 'visible.So', 'enjoy', 'kind', 'violent', 'cinema', ""'ll"", 'definately', 'one', 'full', 'likes', 'above-mentioned', 'scene', 'stabbing', 'gore', 'Nazi-uniform', 'etc', 'What', 'else', 'can', 'attract', 'exploitation', 'films', 'lovers', 'like', 'previous', 'Fulci', 'works', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'like', 'Cat', 'Brain', 'too', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'Maestro', 'hand', 'here', 'just', 'Lucio', 'achieved', 'new', 'level', 'film', 'new', 'level', 'brutality', 'maybe', 'new', 'level', 'sense', 'decide.And', 'still', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'see', 'nice', 'DVD', 'release', 'outstanding', 'movie']",A Cat in the Brain

664856,A3PERVDBNCQJQV,B00005M209,"Brian R Yandle ""Brian R Yandle""","[0, 0]","Of all the Fulci films ever made, perhaps his opus Cat In The Brain has received the most mixed reviews. Needless to say, it's not his greatest masterpiece but certainly not a waste of your precious time either. Fans of the late Fulci will not be able to sleep until they've witnessed the bloody atrocities nor until they have this DVD within their grasp. After all, it's a Grindhouse release & anyone who knows anything about Grindhouse will tell you they dont' do anything half ass. Cannibal Holocaust, anyone?Perhaps Fulci is best remembered for his blood-soaked horror epics in the eighties & his widely acclaimed zombie flicks so we simply cannot envision anything such as Cat.  Even so, the maestro doesn't disappoint us but rather takes a completely different approach to the horror genre which could very well be his most ambitious work ever if you can imagine that. If nothing else, let this film serve as a good final film from our beloved director & call it a day. Hell, the extras alone on this baby are worth the cost you will invest in this special edition & the first 2,500 copies are limited edition copies that include a lenticular cover which hardcore enthusiasts will no doubt shell out their hard earned cash for.Cat is a fairly fun flick for what it is. It's darkly humorous, ultra-gory, & really does make it's audience think about the horror film-making industry as a whole. While Fulci could've milked the whole concept of paranoia regarding video nasties in the late eighties or nineties a bit more, he tosses that card in pursuit of a more bizarre comedy with a twist of nostalgia & plenty of the red stuff. Lucio actually plays himself in this partciluar film as a horror film director (who would've thunk?) that seems to be either burnt out in the process of his craft or a tad bit disillusioned if you will. Have these films caused him to lose touch with reality & could he capable of murdering people in real life?Unable to cope with the violent images in his head which stem from making one too many gruesome flicks, Fulci decides to visit a psychoanalyst in hopes of a cure. Throughout the course of his visits, the viewer immediately suspects something may not be so kosher about the doctor & soon things begin to spiral out of control. Unbeknownst to Fulci, the psychiatrist is a psychopath who wishes to use Fulci's mental breakdown to his advantage with the grand intention of framing our director for these crimes. Heh.While Fulci was accused of simply using a great deal of footage from the archives of his older works, Cat InThe Brain is not just a copy & paste job by any means & the scenes are actually well-integrated into the overall story.  Yes, Fulci addicts will recognize some montages from some of the lesser known vehicles as well as Bianchi's Massacre (which I can't seem to find anywhere online as of right now).  Having said that, this could naturally deter some potential viewers although most Americans are not well versed when it comes to international horror flicks & will more than likely overlook this.Most of us will either love or hate Cat In The Brain but I'm riding the fence for right now. I can definitely appreciate the artistry as always with anything Lucio makes but this wasn't my all-time favorite film even though it's doubtful that I'll ever get rid of it. Cat In The Brain will perhaps grow on me over a period of time & I'm hoping the film gets better with repeated viewings although I've only watched it twice since my purchase on 03/31/2009. Somehow, I believe this one would've really been a lot better had I never seen a Fulci film & had nothing to cross reference. Sadly, I was a bit spolied with films like The New York Ripper & of course the classic Zombie so I'm not overly impressed. Nevertheless, it's certainly not a waste of time.",3,Get Brained,1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,3815,"['Fulci', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'perhaps', 'opus', 'Cat', 'Brain', 'received', 'most', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'Needless', 'say', 'not', 'greatest', 'masterpiece', 'certainly', 'not', 'waste', 'precious', 'time', 'Fans', 'late', 'Fulci', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'sleep', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'bloody', 'atrocities', 'have', 'DVD', 'grasp', 'Grindhouse', 'release', 'anyone', 'who', 'anything', 'Grindhouse', 'will', 'tell', 'dont', 'do', 'anything', 'half', 'ass', 'Cannibal', 'Holocaust', 'anyone', 'Perhaps', 'Fulci', 'best', 'remembered', 'blood-soaked', 'horror', 'epics', 'eighties', 'widely', 'acclaimed', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'envision', 'anything', 'such', 'Cat', 'Even', 'so', 'maestro', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'rather', 'completely', 'different', 'approach', 'horror', 'genre', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'most', 'ambitious', 'work', 'ever', 'can', 'imagine', 'nothing', 'else', 'let', 'film', 'serve', 'good', 'final', 'film', 'beloved', 'director', 'call', 'day', 'Hell', 'extras', 'alone', 'baby', 'are', 'cost', 'will', 'invest', 'special', 'edition', 'first', '2,500', 'copies', 'are', 'limited', 'edition', 'copies', 'include', 'lenticular', 'cover', 'hardcore', 'enthusiasts', 'will', 'doubt', 'shell', 'out', 'hard', 'earned', 'cash', 'for.Cat', 'fairly', 'fun', 'flick', 'what', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'ultra-gory', 'really', 'make', 'audience', 'think', 'horror', 'film-making', 'industry', 'whole', 'Fulci', 'could', ""'ve"", 'milked', 'whole', 'concept', 'paranoia', 'regarding', 'video', 'nasties', 'late', 'eighties', 'nineties', 'bit', 'more', 'card', 'pursuit', 'more', 'bizarre', 'comedy', 'twist', 'nostalgia', 'plenty', 'red', 'stuff', 'Lucio', 'actually', 'partciluar', 'film', 'horror', 'film', 'director', 'who', 'would', ""'ve"", 'thunk', 'be', 'either', 'burnt', 'out', 'process', 'craft', 'tad', 'bit', 'disillusioned', 'will', 'Have', 'films', 'caused', 'lose', 'touch', 'reality', 'could', 'capable', 'murdering', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'Unable', 'cope', 'violent', 'images', 'head', 'stem', 'making', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'gruesome', 'flicks', 'Fulci', 'visit', 'psychoanalyst', 'hopes', 'cure', 'course', 'visits', 'viewer', 'immediately', 'something', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'kosher', 'doctor', 'soon', 'things', 'begin', 'spiral', 'control', 'Unbeknownst', 'Fulci', 'psychiatrist', 'psychopath', 'who', 'use', 'Fulci', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'advantage', 'grand', 'intention', 'framing', 'director', 'crimes', 'Heh.While', 'Fulci', 'was', 'accused', 'simply', 'using', 'great', 'deal', 'footage', 'archives', 'older', 'works', 'Cat', 'InThe', 'Brain', 'not', 'just', 'copy', 'paste', 'job', 'means', 'scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'well-integrated', 'overall', 'story', 'Yes', 'Fulci', 'addicts', 'will', 'recognize', 'montages', 'lesser', 'known', 'vehicles', 'as', 'well', 'Bianchi', 'Massacre', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'anywhere', 'online', 'right', 'now', 'Having', 'said', 'could', 'naturally', 'deter', 'potential', 'viewers', 'most', 'Americans', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'versed', 'when', 'international', 'horror', 'flicks', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'overlook', 'this.Most', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'Cat', 'Brain', ""'m"", 'riding', 'fence', 'right', 'now', 'can', 'definitely', 'appreciate', 'artistry', 'always', 'anything', 'Lucio', 'was', ""n't"", 'all-time', 'favorite', 'film', 'even', 'doubtful', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'get', 'rid', 'Cat', 'Brain', 'will', 'perhaps', 'grow', 'period', 'time', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'film', 'better', 'repeated', 'viewings', ""'ve"", 'only', 'watched', 'twice', 'purchase', '03/31/2009', 'Somehow', 'believe', 'one', 'would', ""'ve"", 'really', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Fulci', 'film', 'had', 'nothing', 'cross', 'reference', 'Sadly', 'was', 'bit', 'spolied', 'films', 'New', 'York', 'Ripper', 'course', 'classic', 'Zombie', ""'m"", 'not', 'overly', 'impressed', 'Nevertheless', 'certainly', 'not', 'waste', 'time']",A Cat in the Brain

664859,A120GIT50UISJP,B00005M209,"Channel KDK12 ""Channel KDK12 - Serious Horror""","[0, 0]","Fulci stars as himself in this unusual giallo about himself and his efforts to complete his latest horror film while he is plagued cwith hallucinations and paranoia. He's on the set, carving out a tale of a man who butchers his wife and dines upon her choicest bits, leaving the scraps to his hog. Fulci is overworked, exhausted, and close to breaking. He goes to lunch, but finds he has no appetite for his favorites, filet mignon and steak tartare. They remind him too much of the morning's shoot. He tries to go home and rest, but his neighbor is cutting up wood in the backyard, and he hallucinates the man covered in blood, the moans of the dying filling his head and driving him close to insanity. It feels, he says, as if a cat were eating his brain.The disturbance sends Fulci searching for a psychiatrist. Lying on the couch of Egon Schwarz, he confesses his fears. The psychiatrist explains to him that the walls between reality and the horror he creates are breaking down. Fulci tries to return to the set, to film a sadistic Nazi sex scene, but now he feels nothing at all; he's seen it all before. A documentary crew arrives to film a ""making-of"" movie, and Fulci tears the clothes off the head of the crew; he apologizes profusely, but she confesses that it was the most thrilling moment of her life. Everything is upside down, and not just for Fulci. To be attacked by the master of horror is the finest moment this woman has ever experienced.Despairing, Fulci returns to the psychiatrist, who says he can plant a hypnotic suggestion that will ease Fulci's mind. Dr. Schwarz has other plans for Fulci, however; the suggestion he plants tears down the final barriers between reality and Fulci's horror-filled imagination. Now Dr. Schwarz can commit murders and Fulci will believe that it is he who is the villain. The body count skyrockets.Lavish and strange, A Cat in the Brain is unlike any other giallo we have seen. Excellent special effects, surreal scenes, and a surprisingly good performance by Fulci himself all work together to warp the world into a fiendish frenzy. The film was clearly made for Fulci fans; others will probably see it as self-indulgent and contrived.

664861,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B00005M209,Dave. K,"[8, 11]","CAT IN THE BRAIN AKA NIGHTMARE CONCERT***  Out of 5Release Date- August 8th, 1990Running Time- 95-MinutesRating- NRScreenplay- Lucio Fulci, Giovanni Simonelli, Antonio TentoriDirector- Lucio FulciStarring- Lucio Fulci, David L. Thompson, Malisa Longo, Jeoffrey Kennedy, Paola Cozzo and Brett HalseyReleased in 1990 Cat in the Brain, which also goes under the title Nightmare Concert came out when Lucio Fulci had clearly seen better days. After the release of The New York Ripper in 1982 Fulci seemed to really lose it and started a major decline in his career and depending on who you talk to that decline started with Ripper though I would disagree. At this point in his career with release such as Murder Rock, Aenigma and Touch of Death Fulci's best days were far behind. Zombi 3 as poor as it was for me is one of the only late day Fulci movies I did however enjoy; if for anything for the so bad its good quality.Cat in the Brain is the only other late day Fulci movie I liked; after Cat in the Brain, Fulci would release three more movies, but for me this is the last movie that he made and would have made the perfect swan song. Despite popular belief Lucio Fulci was much more than a gore director with his movies such as Don't Torture a Duckling and Seven Notes in Black, Fulci was a filmmaker who can tell a story and create scenes with suspense and tension. Even though Zombi started his splatter era it's also a movie driven by suspense and tension and some really great atmosphere. And while some of these qualities were in his splatter flicks of the 80s they were more of a showcase for over the top, but excellent gore F/X.Cat in the Brain is a movie by a director who is past his prime, but still has that one movie left in him. While this isn't one of the best movies of his career it is the best of his late day movies and besides Zombi 3 this is the only one worth watching. The plot is simple; Lucio Fulci sort of plays himself a director named none other than Lucio Fulci who is a horror filmmaker and from all the violent movies he's made he's starting to have trouble separating reality from fantasy.Cat in the Brain is also sort of a highlight reel of Italian cinema as most of the gore scenes are footage from other Italian horror flicks including some of Fulci's movies. But believe it or not the gore scenes from Fulci's movies aren't his more popular works, but his lesser movies like When Alice Broke the Mirror, which is better known as Touch of Death. All of Brett Halsey's scenes are actually shots from Touch of Death and they were the only good scenes from a rather poor movie.The screenplay by Lucio Fulci, Giovanni Simonelli & Antonio Tentori was fairly interesting; the concept was very good, but the execution was slightly off. There's no real development to the characters and it's never really explained by Lucio Fulci is starting to have a breakdown in gripping reality and fantasy, well it is explained actually, but I should say not enough was done with it. At times the script never really moves forward and often enough it just seems to repeat itself with different words. But as a whole the script was fairly decent, but the concept as excellent as it was just never got enough depth. And when it comes to the writing I'm not sure how it worked; since some footage are from other movies I don't know if that's why some writers are credited or if they actually worked with Fulci on the script.The motivation for the killer is never really made clear and these were the flaws. Now I suppose these flaws are typical in horror and even with Fulci's previous movies, but Don't Torture a Duckling and Seven Notes in Black were actually well written and Fulci can deliver with the writing even if his movies aren't really known for that. But with Cat in the Brain the concept again was brilliant, but it just never really gets too deep into the characters.As director Lucio Fulci is a bit uneven; compared to his last few flicks and what came after, Cat in the Brain seems like a masterpiece, but it's far from that. The pacing of Cat in the Brain is a little off and there are some slow moments as well as some that don't really work well. At times the film can be slightly sloppy, and while the production values aren't great they are by far better than his last few. Cat in the Brain was a fitting movie for Fulci to make at this point of his career, but had this been made in his prime back in the 70s or early 80s it probably would be among his best work if not his best movie, but seeing as this film was released at the downside of his career it actually came out fairly well even despite some sloppy scenes. Bottom line is Cat in the Brain doesn't showcase why Fulci became an Icon in the horror genre, but again for a film at the downside of his career it turned out well.The major positive point about this film is it feels like a Lucio Fulci flick. That's actually the problem I had with some of his work after The New York Ripper; a lot of his movies post Ripper didn't feel like Fulci. But Cat in the Brain does have the look and feel of a Fulci movie. As I stated earlier Fulci could deliver a suspense and tension filled movie and I'd actually say his work in the 70s is every bit as strong as anything Dario Argento or Mario Bava did, but Cat in the Brain does lack in that area, but I have to say the movie turned out well for the most part. Don't expect something along the lines of Don't Torture a Duckling or Zombi 2, but for what it's worth Fulci does manage to put together an enjoyable if not flawed film. Cat in the Brain can be a bit slow at times and maybe even a bit boring, but if you stick with it despite all the flaws by the end the movie just might win you over like it did with me.The acting is quite weak, but that's to be expected, but Fulci actually delivers a fairly good performance. Cat in the Brain is a very personal movie of a tortured soul and that's what Fulci was in real life and that does often show in some of his movies though fans have made his movies seem deeper than they actually were. But Lucio Fulci actually does rather well with his role and his performance again really wasn't bad at all the rest of the cast however was forgettable with except Brett Halsey, but his scenes, which again are taken from Touch of Death only involve the gore scenes and nothing else.The gore in Cat in the Brain is mostly footage of other movies, but unless you know the movies or know the footage is from other flicks you wouldn't even notice. Normally you can always tell when the footage is lifted, but it's edited into Cat in the Brain rather well and won't even notice it unless like I said you know the movies. There is a really great scene that was a clear homage to the shower scene in Psycho and I don't know what movie it was from, but it was one of my favorite scenes and Fulci shows he can still shoot a gore scene as well. There is one kill scene towards the end of the movie, which was shot for Cat in the Brain and it's one of the best of Fulci's career.Overall Cat in the Brain was a fun if not flawed movie by Lucio Fulci; while there is no doubt this is one of his better late day movies it's not on par with most of his movies from the 70s and 80s. Some elements of the movie come out a little silly and sloppy, but as a whole Cat in the Brain makes for a fun watch even if it takes time to get going. This would have been the perfect movie for Fulci to end his career on and while he would do three more movies after this for me this was the last movie by Lucio Fulci.The DVD was released by Grindhouse Releasing and once again they prove without a shadow of a doubt they are by far the best company for horror and cult releases. The DVD is loaded with extras with a great in depth interview with Lucio Fulci. Cat in the Brain just might be their best release yet. Grindhouse Releasing often takes a long time to finally release a movie and sometimes we get delay after delay and while they aren't the most active either, but no company can compare with their releases. Grindhouse Releasing always goes all out on movies that won't be huge sellers. Thank you Grindhouse Releasing for all you've done for horror and cult!",4,"Not classic Fulci, but better than most of late day flicks",1239148800,"04 8, 2009",2009,8218,"['CAT', 'IN', 'THE', 'BRAIN',

Expect lots of Fulci and lots of gore, but with that being said, this is a movie which I'd recommend mostly to fans only (everyone else could probably just stop after New York Ripper).  It wouldn't surprise me if this had the lowest budget of any Fulci film, it basically reuses scenes from other late period Fulci films with added footage of Fulci, the effect is sometimes disjointed and its easy to see why this film divides Fulci fans.

664863,A3L31489BCB1D7,B00005M209,El Kabong,"[17, 52]","As one who often paid good coin to see Fulci movies during their brief theatrical runs, I can appreciate the guilty pleasure of kicking back to hoot at badly-dubbed sadism and cheesy gore. But I draw the line at clods who insist that Lucio Fulci was some kind of tortured, misunderstood artist. Better you should write theses on the mise-en-scene of AIRPORT 1975, or maybe the underlying theme of ROLLER BOOGIE. There's no doubt Fulci was intending to shock his audience with mean-spirited viciousness; however, his ham-handed obviousness and ineptitude are what make his films &quot;classics&quot;. I haven't seen BEATRICE CENCI or that DUCKLING one, so maybe there was some real talent there once. But from ZOMBIE onward, Fulci delivered more unintentional comedy than on-purpose terror. CAT IN THE BRAIN is probably his worst ever, a hopeless porridge of old gore-fx footage spliced into new scenes in an excruciating attempt at a psychological thriller. A horror-film director slowly losing his ability to distinguish reality from fantasy IS a scenario ripe with possibilities: wait till you see how badly this simple-yet-solid premise is botched. Or better yet, take my word for it and pass altogether. I hold no personal animus against the late Fulci, but it irritates me no end that this guy is slowly gaining a reputation as some kind of great Italian moviemaker - mostly from lazy gorehounds who can't be bothered to check out De Sica, Rossellini, Visconti or legit horror masters like Bava and Freda.

I have never understood the cult of Fulci, as he has made some of the worst films ever made.  This film is a prime example.  Filled with bad acting, bad dubbing, cheesy gore, a stupid story, continuity flubs, and just overall bad craftmanship, it was a chore to sit through this one.  It isn't surprising that many current American horror filmmakers cite Fulci as an influence, as their work is reminiscent of his: sloppy, badly written, badly directed, and just, well, BAD.  In some of Fulci's earlier films (like The Beyond, House by the Cemetary and City of the Living Dead), there's a really visceral gore scene, a decent camera move, and/or a really strange, surreal ending.  I do believe the endings of both The Beyond and House by the Cemetary are surreal and strange purposely, but in Cat in the Brain, there's none of that.  Fulci's performance isn't that bad (he always had a cameo in his films, and was always good), but overall this film is his worst, and that's saying something.

To me, it is one of those films that pretty much has something for everyone.  Remember, it was made well past the time that Fulci made his visceral horror masterpiece THE BEYOND, so it wouldn't be fair to compare it with that film, ZOMBIE, CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD, etc.CAT IN THE BRAIN (also known as NIGHTMARE CONCERT) stars Lucio Fulci as himself - a horror movie director who is having a bit of a breakdown as a result of all of the violent images he creates for the screen.  Soon, it seems people are being murdered just like in his films.  Are the horror films Fulci creates causing him to lose touch with reality and actually murder people in real life?Much has been said about Fulci, from that he was a tyrant on set to him being a lovable, funny and quirky character.  His lead performance in this film shows that lovable, funny side.  He is clearly poking fun at the films he has made, certainly not taking them too seriously.  But at the same time, his film is making a comment about the notion that violence in film leads to violence in real life and the hypocrisies practiced by those who often make such ridiculous remarks.If you don't care about Fulci or social commentary but just want a fun, gory film, this is for you too.  Much of the gore is taken from other late '80s Fulci productions, and some criticize that fact.  But why criticize what was precisely the point of the film to begin with??  This wasn't merely a question of budget -- the movie is about Fulci as a director of gore films.  Why not use the exact scenes he created for other films to illustrate his filmed visions of violence?For those who didn't enjoy CAT IN THE BRAIN the first time around, it deserves another look.  And for those who have no idea who Lucio Fulci is, to me you don't get the full picture without seeing his incredibly entertaining performance in this film.",5,"Fulci, fun, gore and even some social commentary!",1237507200,"03 20, 2009",2009,1953,"[""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'many', 'Euro-Cult', 'and/or', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'one', 'films', 'pretty', 'much', 'something', 'everyone', 'Remember', 'was', 'made', 'well', 'time', 'Fulci', 'made', 'visceral', 'horror', 'masterpiece', 'THE', 'BEYOND', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'fair', 'compare', 'film', 'ZOMBIE', 'CITY', 'OF', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'DEAD', 'etc.CAT', 'IN', 'THE', 'BRAIN', 'also', 'known', 'NIGHTMARE', 'CONCERT', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'horror', 'movie', 'director', 'who', 'having', 'bit', 'breakdown', 'result', 'violent', 'screen', 'Soon', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'murdered', 'just', 'films', 'Are', 'horror', 'films', 'Fulci', 'causing', 'lose', 'touch', 'reality', 'actually', 'murder', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'Much', 'been', 'said', 'Fulci', 'was', 'tyrant', 'set', 'being', 'lovable', 'funny', 'quirky', 'character', 'lead', 'performance', 'film', 'lovable', 'funny', 'side', 'clearly', 'poking', 'fun', 'films', 'made', 'certainly', 'not', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'making', 'comment', 'notion', 'violence', 'film', 'leads', 'violence', 'real', 'life', 'hypocrisies', 'practiced', 'who', 'often', 'make', 'such', 'ridiculous', 'remarks.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Fulci', 'social', 'commentary', 'just', 'want', 'fun', 'gory', 'film', 'too', 'Much', 'gore', 'taken', 'other', 'late', ""'80s"", 'Fulci', 'productions', 'criticize', 'fact', 'why', 'criticize', 'what', 'was', 'precisely', 'point', 'film', 'begin', 'was', ""n't"", 'merely', 'question', 'budget', 'movie', 'about', 'Fulci', 'director', 'gore', 'films', 'Why', 'not', 'use', 'exact', 'scenes', 'created', 'other', 'films', 'illustrate', 'filmed', 'visions', 'violence', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'CAT', 'IN', 'THE', 'BRAIN', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'look', 'who', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'full', 'picture', 'seeing', 'incredibly', 'entertaining', 'performance', 'film']",A Cat in the Brain

While Fulci does a reasonable job playing himself, the psychiatrist provides one of the worst performances I have seen on screen for many a year, being alternately wooden or over the top hammy.

664868,A30OBK88BUOJZG,B00005M209,Linda Juarbe,"[0, 0]","FILM: this later day fulci film is a little hard for me to explain but i'll try my best. lucio fulci stars as himself(?), a director of gory horror films who lately has been halucinating and having visons of bizzare sex and violence. he seems to be going crazy so he sees a psychiatrist who happens to be a serial killer. the psychiatrist decides to use fulci as a diversion to his slayings because since fulci is going crazy amd seeing things he sometimes ends up at the scenes of the shrinks crimes. that probably isnt a very good explanation of the plot but cat in the brain isnt to concerned about following a good plot. no, cat in the brain is much more interested in filling the screen with graphic, brutal murder sequences and disgusting gore. fulci has always beem known for doing over the top gore and cat in the brain is no exception. the gore sort of comes in 2 forms: scens shot for the film (the psychiatrists murders, some of fulcis visions) and footage taken from some of fulcis other films and films he's produced (the films fulcis character is directing in the movie, some of fulcis visions). so some of the gore and violence is from other films. most notebly all the gore from fulcis Touch Of Death ends up in this film, some of it as a film fulci is directing and some as murders happening in the actual film. any way, theres plenty of gore. hands are hacked off, limbs are eviscerated, faces are bashed apart, throats are sliced, guts are ripped out, there are many stab wounds and heads are lopped off by chainsaws in usual fulci detail. any one who doesnt like gore will want to avoid this film, as will any one who doesnt like seeing woman being killed. i'm not saying that fulci is a woman hater or takes pleasure in woman being mutilated but some of the murders of the female characters have a bit of sexuality mixed into the violence like when right before a woman is disembowled with a hook her skirt is ripped off, leaving her running around in her underpants. or another scene where a hooker runs through the forest topless before having her throat carved. maybe i'm just over analyzing things but it seems a little mysoginistic (probably not spelled right). personally, i dont mind these scenes. its just a movie, and its a movie you cant really take seriously. the special effects are cheap(but satisfying)and the acting is very hammy so if your offended then grow up, there are better things to be upset about. cat in the brain is a very fun little film. the mix of graphic gore and hammy, comedic acting combine to make cat in the brain one of fulcis most enjoyable films. it drags in some parts and some scenes show a serious lack in funds but the movie is fun to watch. any fan of fulci and trash cinema will not regret seeing cat in the brain. 4/5DVD: i've been waiting for a lonmg time to get this film on dvd. having seen it on bootleg dvd before i couldnt wait to get a legit release. grindhouse has (as always) done a stellar job with this dvd. the film is uncut and the quality is fantastic. the extras are a real treat especially the interviews with fulci. there are over 90 minutes of fulci interviews, a 40-50 minute interview with the star of Touch Of Death and some brief interviews with other actors who've worked with fulci. there are of course the slew of trailers to films grindhouse is taking its sweet time releasing. if grindhouse released more films then they would probably be the #1 company of exploitation/horror releases. i guess you cant blame them for the small rouster considering the huge amount of material put on thier dvds. this is a great dvd, dont hesitate to pick it up.great movie, great dvd, buy it now!",4,"a great, trashy gorefest gets its

664869,A2AHLDQGIA4T2K,B00005M209,Nicholas Ehst,"[12, 17]","I'll begin this review by warning everybody that it will only focus on the content of the film, not the DVD itself (which is still 2 months from release at the time of this review).  This being an Image Entertainment release though, I feel safe in my assumption that the sound and video quality will be at least acceptable.This is in a way Fulci's autobiography.  Fulci on Fulci if you will. A look (sort of) into the mind of one of the Italian Cinema's most controversial and prolific filmmakers, at least that was the idea.  This movie can only be taken on one level, gore munching fun.  Unfortunately all of the potential of a poignant look into the mind of the maestro is absolutely wasted, and what's left is a somewhat 2 dimensional story. A director of violent movies (Lucio Fulci) tries to cure himself of all the mental anguish having created such pieces of horror celluloid bestows upon him. In his hunt for absolution, he finds himself in the office of one of the most ludicrously acted doctors this side of Brian Yuzna's The Dentist, who takes it upon himself to live out every murderous fantasy he's ever had and pin the wrap on Fulci.This idea in itself would have still made for an interesting movie, if not an incredibly deep one, but as anybody interested in this movie probably already knows, only around of half of the movie is actually a new film. Most of Cat in the Brain (or Nightmare Concert as it is also commonly known) plays as sort of a Fulci's greatest hits, being made up of gory highlights from many of his lesser known latter films (and a few movies that he didn't actually direct).  It's not unlike, if Lucio's career had been a television series, this would be his end of the 5th season &quot;flash back episode&quot;.Even though many have taken issue with the somewhat plaguristic leanings of this movie, the idea itself still kind of works. The problem is the execution is such that the viewer's head is left absolutely spinning. The film cuts from story, to random gore, to story and back again, allowing the film to get to the point where even the most rabid of gore hounds will be tapping his foot and wondering &quot;When is the blood gonna stop, and the film gonna start again?&quot;Interestingly enough, through all of this mayhem, Fulci proves to not be all that bad of an actor (his 8,000,000 Hitchokian cameos more than likely got him ready for the role), but unfortunately for the film, he is the only one who appears very fit for the screen.This film will more than likely only be truly enjoyed by Fulci (or eurohorror) enthusiasts, and while others might enjoy it, they probably won't be able to sit through repeated viewings. But if you are an admirer of the late maestro's work, then there is no reason to not own this &quot;ode to himself&quot;.  And besides, where else but in a movie made by Fulci, about Fulci would we see multiple Italian beauties swooning &quot;Look, it's the director Lucio Fulci, maybe I can be in his next movie.&quot;  From the sound of it, she probably has never seen what most often happens to girls in Fulci's movies.",3,Fulci on Fulci,993254400,"06 23, 2001",2001,3096,"[""'ll"", 'begin', 'review', 'warning', 'everybody', 'will', 'only', 'focus', 'content', 'film', 'not', 'DVD', 'still', '2', 'months', 'release', 'time', 'review', 'being', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'release', 'feel', 'safe', 'assumption', 'sound', 'video', 'quality', 'will', 'be', 'least', 'acceptable.This', 'way', 'Fulci', 'autobiography', 'Fulci', 'Fulci', 'will', 'look', 'sort', 'mind', 'one', 'Italian', 'Cinema', 'most', 'controversial', 'prolific', 'filmmakers', 'least', 'was', 'idea', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'taken', 'one', 'level', 'gore', 'munching', 'fun', 'Unfortunately', 'potential', 'poignant', 'look', 'mind', 'maestro', 'absolutely', 'wasted', 'what', 'left', 'somewhat', '2', 'dimensional', 'story', 'director', 'violent', 'movies', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'cure', 'mental', 'anguish', 'having', 'created', 'such', 'pieces', 'horror', 'celluloid', 'hunt', 'absolution', 'office', 'one', 'most', 'ludicrously', 'acted', 'doctors', 'side', 'Brian', 'Yuzna', 'Dentist', 'who', 'live', 'out', 'murderous', 'fantasy', 'ever', 'had', 'pin', 'wrap', 'Fulci.This', 'idea', 'would', 'have', 'still', 'made', 'interesting', 'movie', 'not', 'incredibly', 'deep', 'one', 'anybody', 'interested', 'movie', 'probably', 'already', 'only', 'half', 'movie', 'actually', 'new', 'film', 'Most', 'Cat', 'Brain', 'Nightmare', 'Concert', 'also', 'commonly', 'known', 'sort', 'Fulci', 'greatest', 'hits', 'being', 'made', 'gory', 'highlights', 'many', 'lesser', 'known', 'latter', 'films', 'few', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'direct', 'not', 'Lucio', 'career', 'had', 'been', 'television', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'end', '5th', 'season', 'quot', 'back', 'episode', 'quot', 'many', 'have', 'taken', 'issue', 'somewhat', 'plaguristic', 'leanings', 'movie', 'idea', 'still', 'kind', 'works', 'problem', 'execution', 'such', 'viewer', 'head', 'left', 'absolutely', 'spinning', 'film', 'cuts', 'story', 'random', 'gore', 'story', 'back', 'again', 'allowing', 'film', 'get', 'point', 'where', 'even', 'most', 'rabid', 'gore', 'hounds', 'will', 'be', 'tapping', 'foot', 'wondering', 'quot', 'When', 'blood', 'gon', 'stop', 'film', 'gon', 'start', 'again', 'quot', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'mayhem', 'Fulci', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'actor', '8,000,000', 'Hitchokian', 'cameos', 'more', 'likely', 'got', 'ready', 'role', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'very', 'fit', 'screen.This', 'film', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'only', 'be', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'Fulci', 'eurohorror', 'others', 'might', 'enjoy', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'sit', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'are', 'admirer', 'late', 'maestro', 'work', 'then', 'reason', 'not', 'own', 'quot', 'ode', 'quot', 'where', 'else', 'movie', 'made', 'Fulci', 'Fulci', 'would', 'see', 'multiple', 'Italian', 'beauties', 'swooning', 'quot', 'Look', 'director', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'maybe', 'can', 'be', 'next', 'movie.', 'quot', 'sound', 'probably', 'never', 'seen', 'what', 'most', 'often', 'girls', 'Fulci', 'movies']",A Cat in the Brain

664871,AOODNGLAEDN76,B00005M209,Robert H. Knox,"[1, 2]","A CAT IN THE BRAIN (aka NIGHTMARE CONCERT) was for many years Lucio Fulci's most elusive horror title... so much so that I had never seen it until I received this fine DVD edition. The film had been announced as an upcoming release twice before, and both times was canceled for reasons unknown to me. So, when this third announcement came, I was skeptical until I actually had the disc in hand. I'm pleased to say that the film is worth the wait; it's both revolting and humorous, and the package includes a generous selection of extras that are actually worth watching. A CAT IN THE BRAIN will most certainly please Fulci addicts with its non-stop parade of hardcore gore, which is presented with such comic gusto that it approaches H. G. Lewis' self-deprecating satire. Yes, the film does make liberal use of stock footage from earlier films, but said footage is well integrated into the story, and these films are largely unknown in the USA. Although Fulci stars as himself, and is clearly no actor, in his own peculiar fashion he has made a film about filmmaking that is as entertaining in its way as 8 1/2 or THE PLAYER. Even those who hate Lucio Fulci's horror titles may take to this one! The quality of this DVD set is fine throughout! And I love the 3D cover!

There are a bunch of interviews(two with Fulci himself), Fulci's appearance at Fangoria's Weekend of Horrors, trailers, galleries and the whole shebang.  A very nice package with a groovy hologram cover.Hows about the movie?  It won't quite tickle you like Fulci's classics, but it's quite good.  As I'm sure you know(about 100 times over)Fulci is playing himself in this film.  He's become quite disturbed and disillusioned by his constant shooting of violent films, and the lines between his work and his life start to blur(some of these scenes are really well done).  He goes to a wacko psychoanalyst(but aren't they all?) for help, but the Doc takes advantage of Fulci's predicament to go on a murder spree for some odd reason(his wife being a hoochie momma may have something to do with it, or maybe he's just having a slow day).  For the Doc, Fulci will make the perfect scapegoat.  He convinces Fulci under hypnosis that Fulci is the one committing the crimes during his horror movie directing induced episodes, while the Doc is really the one doing the deed(the huge grin worn by the Doc as he stalks his victims is funny yet sinister at the same time).That's your plot, folks.  A Woody Allen movie gone mad!!  It's more in the giallo vein, except there's really no mystery going on, only a question of what's real and what's in Fulci's mind.  And it is a gory one too, as you might have guessed.  Yes, there is footage from some of Fulci's lesser known films, as well as Bianchi's Massacre, but I didn't find this so appalling and distracting as some did.  In fact, I think it actually fit what was going on pretty well.It's cool to see Fulci doing something a bit different and poking fun at his career.  Though still brutal, gory and kinda comically dubbed like many of his films, it's like nothing else he's done before.  I'd actually suggest this to the critics(including Roger Ebert) who had probably only seen Zombie and/or The Beyond and feel Fulci is nothing more than a hack horror director.  Oh hell, who am I kidding?  They already have their minds made up.  But regardless, Fulci fans have never given a hoot about what other people say, so it's all good.  Obviously this is recommended for the Fulci fan, though that really goes without saying.Thanks again, Grindhouse.",4,"You Can Throw Away That Cruddy VHS You Paid $400,000 For!",1238198400,"03 28, 2009",2009,2433,"['saints', 'Grindhouse', 'have', 'finally', 'given', 'Cat', 'Brain', 'being', 'cool', 'guys', 'are', 'have', 'given', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'treatment', 'are', 'bunch', 'interviews', 'two', 'Fulci', 'Fulci', 'appearance', 'Fangoria', 'Weekend', 'Horrors', 'trailers', 'galleries', 'whole', 'shebang', 'very', 'nice', 'package', 'groovy', 'hologram', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'quite', 'tickle', 'Fulci', 'classics', 'quite', 'good', ""'m"", 'sure', 'know', '100', 'times', 'Fulci', 'playing', 'film', 'become', 'quite', 'disturbed', 'disillusioned', 'constant', 'shooting', 'violent', 'films', 'lines', 'work', 'life', 'start', 'blur', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'wacko', 'psychoanalyst', 'are', ""n't"", 'help', 'Doc', 'advantage', 'Fulci', 'predicament', 'go', 'murder', 'spree', 'odd', 'reason', 'wife', 'being', 'hoochie', 'momma', 'may', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'maybe', 'just', 'having', 'slow', 'day', 'Doc', 'Fulci', 'will', 'make', 'perfect', 'scapegoat', 'Fulci', 'hypnosis', 'Fulci', 'one', 'committing', 'crimes', 'horror', 'movie', 'directing', 'induced', 'episodes', 'Doc', 'really', 'one', 'doing', 'deed', 'huge', 'grin', 'worn', 'Doc', 'victims', 'funny', 'yet', 'sinister', 'same', 'time', '.That', 'plot', 'folks', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'gone', 'mad', 'more', 'giallo', 'vein', 'really', 'mystery', 'going', 'only', 'question', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'Fulci', 'mind', 'gory', 'one', 'too', 'might', 'have', 'guessed', 'Yes', 'footage', 'Fulci', 'lesser', 'known', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'Bianchi', 'Massacre', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'so', 'appalling', 'distracting', 'did', 'fact', 'think', 'actually', 'fit', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'pretty', 'well.It', 'cool', 'see', 'Fulci', 'doing', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'poking', 'fun', 'career', 'still', 'brutal', 'gory', 'kinda', 'comically', 'dubbed', 'many', 'films', 'nothing', 'else', 'done', ""'d"", 'actually', 'suggest', 'critics', 'including', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'who', 'had', 'probably', 'only', 'seen', 'Zombie', 'Beyond', 'feel', 'Fulci', 'nothing', 'more', 'hack', 'horror', 'director', 'Oh', 'hell', 'who', 'am', 'kidding', 'already', 'have', 'minds', 'made', 'up', 'regardless', 'Fulci', 'fans', 'have', 'never', 'given', 'hoot', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'say', 'good', 'Obviously', 'recommended', 'Fulci', 'fan', 'really', 'saying.Thanks', 'again', 'Grindhouse']",A Cat in the Brain

664874,A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9,B00005M209,William Amazzini,"[1, 2]","I finally caught up to this release after a few years purchasing it.  Mostly all of Director Lucio Fulci's  genre films have been released onto DVD except his wonderfully erotic 'THE DEVIL'S HONEY' aka 'DANGEROUS OBSESSION' aka 'IL MIELE DEL DIAVOLO'-1986 and his early comedies. 'CAT IN THE BRAIN' aka 'NIGHTMARE CONCERT' aka 'UN GATTO NEL CERVELLO'-1990 should only be purchased by viewers who are familiar or who have seen at least his classic titles because the film emerges as a catharsis on film making and his own personal journey in keeping up with them so first time viewers may scratch their heads in befuddlement or appalled by its graphic cartoon-like sequences. It's not one of my favorites as its constructed using clips from other films Fulci was involved in and seems to get lost in its mantric presentation of the director's supposed state of mind although many of his messages do penetrate through it all.  You have probably read all of the reviews included here but not many have commented on the superb presentation by Box Office Spectaculars of the film and its second disc of superb extras.  Not only is the film presented in a clear transfer so you can throw away your bootleg copies but disc one also includes 20 minutes of footage from Fangoria magazines 1996 Weekend of Horrors where Fulci finally got his due.  Looking very frail and obviously put off by the stupidity of the questions asked of him, Fulci would pass away shortly after this appearance which makes it more poignant.  Disc two continues with two excellent 40 minute interviews with the maestro : Genre terrorist in which he discusses the thriller and horror genres and the television years where he gives an excellent account of the Italian film industry in the late fifties and early sixties.  Its like spending over an hour in your screening room getting to know this underrated artist.  Included also is a 45 minute interview with actor Brett Halsey who discusses his film career in Hollywood and Europe with an incredible amount of stories and his work with Fulci.  Rounding out the rest of the disc are written bios and filmographies of Fulci and Halsey, an Italian and US trailer for the film, posters and stills galleries , 3 short remembrances of Fulci by actors Jeoffrey Kennedy, Sacha Maria Darwin and Malisa Longo which seem to be culled from the DVD tribute 'PAURA-LUCIO FULCI REMEMBERED'-2008, and 14 trailers to other sleazy grindhouse forays.
