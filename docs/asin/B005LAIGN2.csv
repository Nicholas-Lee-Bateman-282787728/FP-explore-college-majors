I guess you just can't please some people. I say this because Red Tails has just so much going for it. Based on the famed Tuskegee Airmen, it is an exciting depiction of war in the air, with a great cast, top notch screenplay, and absolutely outstanding computer graphics, courtesy of George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic team, who are simply the best in the business. It all seemed so bloody realistic! As for the cast, well, they were great. Led by Terence Howard & Cuba Gooding Jnr, they faithfully portrayed a group of young negro pilots, sidelined by the US military because of their colour, & the false premise that they lacked the courage & intelligence to fly against the best pilots that Germany could produce. But when they are given the opportunity to act as cover for the long-range bomber groups, they finally get the chance to prove their worth, and they do it in style. The battle scenes are superb & among some of the best computer graphic action you will ever see. I loved Red Tails, & if great war action is your bag, then watch this film; you will not be disappointed.",5,Well done!,1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,1239,"['have', 'spent', 'time', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'Red', 'Tails', 'must', 'admit', 'am', 'surprised', 'gave', 'less', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'guess', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'please', 'people', 'say', 'because', 'Red', 'Tails', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'Based', 'famed', 'Tuskegee', 'Airmen', 'exciting', 'depiction', 'war', 'air', 'great', 'cast', 'top', 'notch', 'screenplay', 'absolutely', 'outstanding', 'computer', 'graphics', 'courtesy', 'George', 'Lucas', 'Industrial', 'Light', 'Magic', 'team', 'who', 'are', 'simply', 'best', 'business', 'seemed', 'so', 'bloody', 'realistic', 'cast', 'well', 'were', 'great', 'Led', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jnr', 'faithfully', 'portrayed', 'group', 'young', 'negro', 'pilots', 'sidelined', 'US', 'military', 'colour', 'false', 'premise', 'lacked', 'courage', 'intelligence', 'fly', 'best', 'pilots', 'Germany', 'could', 'produce', 'when', 'are', 'given', 'opportunity', 'act', 'cover', 'long-range', 'bomber', 'groups', 'finally', 'get', 'chance', 'prove', 'worth', 'do', 'style', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'superb', 'best', 'computer', 'graphic', 'action', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'loved', 'Red', 'Tails', 'great', 'war', 'action', 'bag', 'then', 'watch', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

1464358,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B005LAIGN2,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","Red Tails, 2012 filmThis movie was inspired by true events. It starts in the air war over Europe where P-51 fighters escort B-17 bombers. Some fighters are distracted by decoys so the main force of enemy fighters attack the bombers and shoot them down. Next four obsolete P-40s fly over Italy in 1944. One attacks a truck on a highway, then they attack a steam locomotive train. They return to base and read the news. There is a discussion in the Pentagon about this unit. The talk tells about the conditions. One pilot visits a local family. The pilots talk about combat. ""Operation Shingle"" will place them in support of a beach landing. They approach enemy fighters and fire on them. Four follow a fighter to attack an enemy airfield and destroy ME-109s on the ground. The colonel needs fighter escorts for the B-17s to reduce losses.One pilot visits the officer's club and starts a fight. A DC-3 brings a colonel with news of new P-51 fighters for their group. Lt. Joe Little rejoins his unit. The Colonel explains why bombers must be defended. Their new fighters will have red tails (for easy identification). They begin to escort a hundred bombers through flak. This time no bombers are lost. One pilot is wounded. Another attacks a war ship. One plane crash lands. A captured pilot is sent to a POW camp. Film cameras recorded the attacks on that war ship. Bomber flyers thank them. They are warned about the German jet planes. The prisoners plan an escape from the POW camp. They will attack a tank factory on the outskirts of Berlin. The Red Tails will fly the first leg. But their replacement does not show up. ME-262's attack the mission with their faster speed. But the P-51's shoot them down (and take casualties).They stay ""on mission"". Sophia gets the bad news. The Colonel talks to his men. The captured pilot returns alive. The Distinguished Unit Citation is given to the 332nd fighter group. They received 90 Distinguished Flying Crosses. Sixty were killed in action. The credits at the end thank the Czech Construction Crew. Production services provided by the Croatia Unit, and filmed at Prague Studios ; also Italy and Slovenia. This is worth watching once but it could have used a better script or story. ""Flyboys"" or ""The Battle of Britain"" were better movies.""Double Victory"" provides a history of the war from the viewpoint of African-Americans. The 1925 War College Report shows the attitudes of that era. The P-51 was the most advanced propeller-driven fighter in the war. The life expectancy of a fighter pilot was 15 to 22 missions. The ME-262 fighter was 100 mph faster than the P-51, but were shot down by P-51s (and Spitfires and Typhoons).

1464361,A172FVEA83DHOP,B005LAIGN2,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I saw Red Tails while I was stationed in Germany, and it occurred to me when I was on my way to see the movie that it was a somewhat historic moment, for me personally at least. Here I was, a black Airman in Germany, on my way to see a movie at an American military base about the first black Airmen and their exploits in the skies over Germany during WWII, the first such movie to feature an all black cast, almost 70 years later. The Tuskeegee Airmen, in more ways than one, were directly responsible for the fact that I had a seat in the theater. They fought for the rights that I take for granted: the right to be an American Airman; the right to be a full and free citizen of my own country; the right to simply sit wherever I want in a movie theater. Ironically, it took George Lucas 23 years to secure a release deal for the film, even though he financed it himself, because it had an all black cast, and no studio believed that a film with an all black cast could make money in wide release.Despite the significance of the occasion, the movie itself left me feeling ambivalent. I'm glad the story was told. I'm glad I had the opportunity to see it. But I can't say I was happy about the the way the story was told. You could quibble about the movie's artistic choices (for instance, seriously, what was up with Ne-Yo's Bubba Gump shtick?), but it was more than that. George Lucas tells a story about a group of men who fought for the opportunity to prove that they were skilled and courageous combatants. They certainly proved that, and the film celebrates that fact, but it does so at the expense of the story of the Tuskeegee Airmen's larger struggle. They didn't struggle to be allowed into the fight simply for the sake of proving that they could in fact fight. In risking their life for the nation, they were affirming their claim to their own country, and eliminating any possible excuse for being denied their rights as citizens. The interviews done with the Tuskeegee Airmen in the years after show that they were fully conscious of that fact:[Speaking of the ""Double V"" campaign launched by the Black press] ""The idea was that we should have a victory. Not only a victory over Adolf Hitler, but that we African-Americans should have a second 'V', the victory over the prejudice and racial segregation that was endemic in society also.""-Mr. Lee Archer, former Tuskeegee AirmanThe movie never goes anywhere near that social and historical context.  But that context is crucial to understanding the depth of character the Tuskeegee Airmen possessed. As courageous as it was to face enemy combatants on the battlefield, it took far more courage to do so when the citizens of your own country would refuse, for instance, to allow you to use an off-base commercial laundry service, preferring instead to accept laundry from German detainees. While their white comrades in arms had to fight on the battlefield, the Tuskeegee Airmen had to fight every moment of every day, before, during, and after the war, to be simply treated as human beings.However, as far as the movie is concerned, it was simply a matter of some obstinate old school racist officers who were determined not to let them fight, and therefore put word on the street that they couldn't fight. Then, after they demonstrate that they're actually s***-hot pilots, they're immediately welcomed into the Armed Forces fraternity and everything is cool. It's a reflection of a narrative about the history of race in America in general that shrinks from acknowledging the depth, intensity and complexity of the racial prejudice that afflicts this nation. In the context of a movie that aims to pay tribute to exceptional courage in the face of exceptional adversity, that kind of timidity is especially unworthy.I still think the movie should be seen. But I think it should be seen with a commitment to use it as a launching point for starting an honest conversation about what the Tuskeegee Airmen's mission truly was, and what still remains to be done to to fully accomplish it. That would be a truly worthy tribute to their memory.",3,A Beginning,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,4104,"['saw', 'Red', 'Tails', 'was', 'stationed', 'Germany', 'occurred', 'when', 'was', 'way', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'somewhat', 'historic', 'moment', 'personally', 'least', 'Here', 'was', 'black', 'Airman', 'Germany', 'way', 'see', 'movie', 'American', 'military', 'base', 'first', 'black', 'Airmen', 'exploits', 'skies', 'Germany', 'WWII', 'first', 'such', 'movie', 'feature', 'black', 'cast', 'almost', '70', 'years', 'later', 'Tuskeegee', 'Airmen', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'were', 'directly', 'responsible', 'fact', 'had', 'seat', 'theater', 'fought', 'rights', 'take', 'granted', 'right', 'be', 'American', 'Airman', 'right', 'be', 'full', 'free', 'citizen', 'own', 'country', 'right', 'simply', 'sit', 'wherever', 'want', 'movie', 'theater', 'Ironically', 'took', 'George', 'Lucas', '23', 'years', 'secure', 'release', 'deal', 'film', 'even', 'financed', 'had', 'black', 'cast', 'studio', 'believed', 'film', 'black', 'cast', 'could', 'make', 'money', 'wide', 'release.Despite', 'significance', 'occasion', 'movie', 'left', 'feeling', 'ambivalent', ""'m"", 'glad', 'story', 'was', 'told', ""'m"", 'glad', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'happy', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'could', 'quibble', 'movie', 'artistic', 'choices', 'instance', 'seriously', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'Ne-Yo', 'Bubba', 'Gump', 'shtick', 'was', 'more', 'George', 'Lucas', 'story', 'group', 'men', 'who', 'fought', 'opportunity', 'prove', 'were', 'skilled', 'courageous', 'combatants', 'certainly', 'proved', 'film', 'fact', 'so', 'expense', 'story', 'Tuskeegee', 'Airmen', 'larger', 'struggle', 'did', ""n't"", 'struggle', 'be', 'allowed', 'fight', 'simply', 'sake', 'proving', 'could', 'fact', 'fight', 'risking', 'life', 'nation', 'were', 'affirming', 'claim', 'own', 'country', 'eliminating', 'possible', 'excuse', 'being', 'denied', 'rights', 'citizens', 'interviews', 'done', 'Tuskeegee', 'Airmen', 'years', 'show', 'were', 'fully', 'conscious', 'fact', '[', 'Speaking', 'Double', 'V', 'campaign', 'launched', 'Black', 'press', ']', 'idea', 'was', 'should', 'have', 'victory', 'Not', 'only', 'victory', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'African-Americans', 'should', 'have', 'second', 'V', 'victory', 'prejudice', 'racial', 'segregation', 'was', 'endemic', 'society', 'also.', '-Mr', 'Lee', 'Archer', 'former', 'Tuskeegee', 'AirmanThe', 'movie', 'never', 'anywhere', 'social', 'historical', 'context', 'context', 'crucial', 'understanding', 'depth', 'character', 'Tuskeegee', 'Airmen', 'possessed', 'As', 'courageous', 'was', 'face', 'enemy', 'combatants', 'battlefield', 'took', 'far', 'more', 'courage', 'do', 'so', 'when', 'citizens', 'own', 'country', 'would', 'refuse', 'instance', 'allow', 'use', 'off-base', 'commercial', 'laundry', 'service', 'preferring', 'instead', 'accept', 'laundry', 'German', 'detainees', 'white', 'comrades', 'arms', 'had', 'fight', 'battlefield', 'Tuskeegee', 'Airmen', 'had', 'fight', 'moment', 'day', 'war', 'be', 'simply', 'treated', 'human', 'beings.However', 'as', 'far', 'movie', 'concerned', 'was', 'simply', 'matter', 'obstinate', 'old', 'school', 'racist', 'officers', 'who', 'were', 'determined', 'not', 'let', 'fight', 'therefore', 'put', 'word', 'street', 'could', ""n't"", 'fight', 'Then', 'demonstrate', ""'re"", 'actually', 's***-hot', 'pilots', ""'re"", 'immediately', 'welcomed', 'Armed', 'Forces', 'fraternity', 'everything', 'cool', 'reflection', 'narrative', 'history', 'race', 'America', 'general', 'acknowledging', 'depth', 'intensity', 'complexity', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'nation', 'context', 'movie', 'pay', 'tribute', 'exceptional', 'courage', 'face', 'exceptional', 'adversity', 'kind', 'timidity', 'especially', 'unworthy.I', 'still', 'think', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'commitment', 'use', 'launching', 'point', 'starting', 'honest', 'conversation', 'what', 'Tuskeegee', 'Airmen', 'mission', 'truly', 'was', 'what', 'still', 'be', 'done', 'fully', 'accomplish', 'would', 'be', 'truly', 'worthy', 'tribute', 'memory']",N/A

1464365,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B005LAIGN2,Andre Dursin,"[1, 1]","A decidedly old-fashioned chronicle of the Tuskegee Airmen - one of producer George Lucas' pet projects dating back to the time of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy - is a bit rough around the edges in terms of its story, yet visually at least, ""Red Tails"" is a compelling production from Lucasfilm and director Anthony Hemingway.Nate Parker, David Oyelowo, Ne-Yo and Elijah Kelly portray members of the African-American combat unit assigned to the skies over Italy in 1944. Their battles in the air and on the ground, fighting discrimination, are given a basic treatment in John Ridley and Aaron McGruder's script, which is chock full of war-movie cliches and predictable dramatic situations. When the film takes flight, however - in a series of brilliantly choreographed and spectacularly animated dog battles from ILM - ""Red Tails"" manages to be sufficiently engaging. Lucas shot ""Red Tails"" fairly inexpensively in the Czech Republic and had a couple of outside vendors work in conjunction with ILM to produce its digital effects, but you'd never know it from the end result, since from a technical angle, the picture is impressively mounted, believably rendering its aerial combat and overall production scale.Overall, because of its unevenness and paper-thin characterizations, ""Red Tails"" is certainly not a great film by any means (and both Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Terence Howard are mostly wasted in supporting roles), but at least it's superior to ""Radioland Murders.""Fox's Blu-Ray of ""Red Tails"" is gorgeous in both its AVC encoded 1080p transfer and DTS MA 5.1 soundtrack - no surprise with Ben Burtt having assembled the audio. Unfortunately, Terence Blanchard's score is an almost complete failure, lacking strong themes and failing to give the inherently dramatic story the musical backing it deserved.

There was not enough background of the challenges faced by African American fliers in the military in the 1940s, there was not enough of the drudgery of the non-essential(?) missions they flew after they arrived in Italy, not enough of the struggles they had to go through to fly combat missions, and, frankly, there were not enough sequences of aerial combat - the real Red Tails flew a TON of missions.  I thought that the side stories, for example of the off-base personal lives of some of the fliers was in a way distracting from the main story (a la Ben Affleck's romance in ""Pearl Harbor"").  It did provide an interesting glimpse into the different way that Italians and Americans viewed African-Americans in those days, and while that was interesting, it was not central enough in my opinion to devote so much of the movie to it.I guess the reason that the overall experience seemed a bit, um, lacking to me is that I constantly felt like I was joining a conversation already in progress or an event already in progress, and that I was not presented the whole story.  Fortunately I already knew something about the Red Tails, so I was able to catch up and make sense of everything, but if someone was just strolling into a theater to watch the movie, they could have been lost in terms of the big picture.All in all I'd have to say that I'd give the movie ""Red Tails"" somewhere between a 6 and an 8 out of 10.  I even debated with myself over whether I thought it was ""OK"" or ""I liked it.""  ""I loved it"" was not one of the options I was considering.I salute the original Red Tails for their service and sacrifice, and George Lucas for producing this story that needed to be told.

The flight scenes, the vistas of the air bases and the Italian countryside, and some of the closeups really looked good. Someone on the filming crew must have had 3D experience, because it shows through in the movie.

Soldiers, men of courage laying their lives on the line for their country, when that country itself was still rife with bigotry and a blinkered view.Sometimes it takes something extraordinary to make people look past their assumptions, and sometimes it simply takes people being brave enough to toe the line, to get the job done, to not go for the glory, but simply to get men home alive.It was, for all its simplicity of focus, a moving movie, I found myself leaking tears and had to take off the glasses to wipe my eyes.

I would have liked to have seen more instances of the actual discrimination and maltreatment of these men as they reported to duty and undertook their training and how they overcame this adversity with dignity.

The problem is, just stringing together a bunch of scenes taken from a bunch of OTHER flicks does not an entertaining movie make.I will say, the actual flying scenes were pretty interesting. Interesting... not really EXCITING. But I did marvel at the CGI skills on display. As a pilot, it was among the best representations of the flight environment I can recall. That's what earned this the second star, because otherwise it was pretty hopeless. Unengaging, to say the least. Even at that, the flying scenes in Top Gun were better by orders of magnitude.Don't bother. Really.

1464388,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005LAIGN2,Chris Kennison,"[13, 23]","George Lucas has overseen the creation and American phenomenon's of six ""Star Wars"" movies and four ""Indiana Jones"" movies, including producing many other smash hit movies, and with his latest Lucas studios release, he says that he's done everything he ever dreamed of doing. That latest release is a biopic about a crew of Negro pilots in the Tuskegee training program, otherwise known as the Red Tails. Not unlike the things that the Tuskegee airmen had to face, on top of facing Nazi's during World War 2, George Lucas faced much alienation with this project from studio executives across Hollywood. Despite his credentials and his long time devotion to the project, Lucas couldn't get a `yes' from a single one of them.Well, ""Red Tails"" may just be one of Lucas' best movies in years, although that isn't saying much. The Tuskegee airmen were delegated to, as one airmen stated in the film, ""shooting traffic""; trains and trucks. Not only were they wrongfully characterized as unintelligent and not brave enough, but they also were facing a public relations machine in a military that didn't want negro airmen getting credit for battles in the newspapers. Thus, they were given unimportant missions.""Red Tails"" is a good return for George Lucas, but also for Cuba Gooding Jr., who won an Oscar for ""Jerry Maguire"" and then went into B-movie oblivion. Terrence Howard has been on a similar road since ""Ray"" and ""Hustle and Flow"", although he's bounced back and forth with an occasional hit.  The real stars of the movie are Nate Parker, who plays Captain Marty ""Easy"" Julian and David Oyelowo who plays Joe ""Lightning"" Little. The two of them are best friends and give character and soul to a film and a story that needed a face.George Lucas is no stranger to filming and creating aerial battles. We've seen them dozens of times in his Star Wars movies and his expertise shows in this movie, they are just a little closer to earth. The battle scenes in ""Red Tails"" are real and engaging. Although some of the dialogue is really stiff and was a direct contrast to the realism of the battle scenes.The biggest problem with ""Red Tails"" has nothing to do with the characters, the story that needs to be told and the battles that were fought and ignored, but the fact that the movie could have told so much more of a story and didn't. Truth be told, the story of the Tuskegee airmen is history that we didn't learn. It is a story that needs to be seen and heard by everyone, but the movie doesn't give it justice. The movie plays like a footnote only to inform us of their existence, but never gets beyond the surface to inform us of anything more.""Red Tails"" could have been so much more, but I still recommend the film, just for the sheer sake that this is a story that isn't taught in our schools and should be.",3,Too much history lesson and no story,1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,2812,"['George', 'Lucas', 'overseen', 'creation', 'American', 'phenomenon', 'six', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movies', 'four', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'movies', 'including', 'producing', 'many', 'other', 'smash', 'hit', 'movies', 'latest', 'Lucas', 'studios', 'release', 'done', 'everything', 'ever', 'dreamed', 'doing', 'latest', 'release', 'biopic', 'crew', 'Negro', 'pilots', 'Tuskegee', 'training', 'program', 'otherwise', 'known', 'Red', 'Tails', 'Not', 'things', 'Tuskegee', 'airmen', 'had', 'face', 'top', 'facing', 'Nazi', 'World', 'War', '2', 'George', 'Lucas', 'faced', 'much', 'alienation', 'project', 'studio', 'executives', 'Hollywood', 'credentials', 'long', 'time', 'devotion', 'project', 'Lucas', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'yes', 'single', 'one', 'them.Well', 'Red', 'Tails', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'Lucas', 'best', 'movies', 'years', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'Tuskegee', 'airmen', 'were', 'delegated', 'one', 'airmen', 'stated', 'film', 'shooting', 'traffic', 'trains', 'trucks', 'Not', 'only', 'were', 'wrongfully', 'characterized', 'unintelligent', 'not', 'brave', 'enough', 'also', 'were', 'facing', 'public', 'relations', 'machine', 'military', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'negro', 'airmen', 'getting', 'credit', 'battles', 'newspapers', 'Thus', 'were', 'given', 'unimportant', 'missions', 'Red', 'Tails', 'good', 'return', 'George', 'Lucas', 'also', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'then', 'went', 'B-movie', 'oblivion', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'been', 'similar', 'road', 'Ray', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'bounced', 'back', 'forth', 'occasional', 'hit', 'real', 'stars', 'movie', 'are', 'Nate', 'Parker', 'who', 'Captain', 'Marty', 'Easy', 'Julian', 'David', 'Oyelowo', 'who', 'Joe', 'Lightning', 'Little', 'two', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'give', 'character', 'soul', 'film', 'story', 'needed', 'face.George', 'Lucas', 'stranger', 'filming', 'creating', 'aerial', 'battles', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dozens', 'times', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movies', 'expertise', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'little', 'closer', 'earth', 'battle', 'Red', 'Tails', 'are', 'real', 'engaging', 'dialogue', 'really', 'stiff', 'was', 'direct', 'contrast', 'realism', 'battle', 'scenes.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Red', 'Tails', 'nothing', 'do', 'characters', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'battles', 'were', 'fought', 'ignored', 'fact', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'told', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'story', 'Tuskegee', 'airmen', 'history', 'did', ""n't"", 'learn', 'story', 'be', 'seen', 'heard', 'everyone', 'movie', ""n't"", 'give', 'justice', 'movie', 'footnote', 'only', 'inform', 'existence', 'never', 'surface', 'inform', 'anything', 'more', 'Red', 'Tails', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'still', 'recommend', 'film', 'just', 'sheer', 'sake', 'story', ""n't"", 'taught', 'schools', 'should', 'be']",N/A

1464392,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAIGN2,C. Sawin,"[31, 70]","Over twenty five years after the fact and Maverick has become a drunk who makes hasty decisions under the influence, Goose has become a bit more reckless and still puts women before anything else, and Iceman's role has been reduced significantly as his smug arrogance is only felt in a handful of lines. What's that you say? Red Tails isn't the urban retelling of Top Gun? Well, you could have fooled me. It's not that it makes much difference though. No matter how you look at it, Red Tails doesn't really have much of anything to offer.At the peak of World War II, African American pilots are considered the lowest of the low. They're considered to be incapable of performing their tasks to their country to the fullest and are given leftover missions that don't even qualify as scraping the bottom of the barrel. The Tuskegee training program is no different as the entire squadron is mostly reduced to shooting down trucks, trains, and perhaps a cow every now and then. That is until Colonel A.J. Bullard (Terrence Howard) succeeds in letting the higher ups give his men a chance and they take full advantage of the opportunity.Red Tails feels really cheesy as soon as that quote is shown in the opening scene. The movie has a $58 million budget, but it certainly doesn't feel that way considering the opening credits. The amalgamation of planes ripping through the sky and tearing each other to pieces feels like a distraction or a cover up for the rest of your senses. Try to pay attention to the credits, how plain they are, and how cheap they look. That along with the score that feels like it was ripped straight out of a stereotypical action film from the 90s doesn't really seem like the type of tone they were going for here. The acting isn't much better as stiffness and monotony seem to be what they were aiming for. The Tuskegee airmen do begin to get a bit more comfortable in their roles as the movie progresses. David Oyelowo takes Lightning the furthest as far as Easy's (Nate Parker) squad goes, but they certainly seem their best in the face of tragedy. Terrence Howard has a few great moments, as well. Specifically his ""highest expectations"" scene he shares with Joe ""Lightning"" Little. But it isn't enough to save a second-rate film.The script is very dry. I don't mean dry humor I mean about as pleasant as trying to listen to somebody with a mouthful of saltine crackers. It feels so stale and again contributes to that 90s atmosphere I mentioned earlier. Keep an ear out for the Americans and how third grade they sound. The dialogue along with the monotonous tone spread out amongst every actor in the film makes everyone come off as a robot. ""These cows are armed,"" is a line that's actually used in the movie. There are a few lines that are almost decent. Winky's (Leslie Odom Jr) line where he says, ""Every time I close that canopy I feel like I'm closing the lid to my own coffin,"" is surprisingly good. It gives the momentary belief that things may turn around, but they never do. Smokey's (Ne-Yo) ""colored"" conversation at the bar is the most amusing thing Red Tails has to offer, as well. There are many lame attempts at humor that just make you groan. Black Jesus is perhaps the worst joke of all, considering how things turn out for Deke (Marcus T. Paulk).I was expecting Red Tails to at least offer a fair amount of eye candy, but the special effects weren't really all that impressive at all. There's a train explosion early on in the film that's been shown in nearly every trailer and TV spot. It's pretty much on the same scale as the train crash in Super 8, but it isn't nearly as spectacular. That's kind of weird considering Super 8 was $8 million dollars cheaper than Red Tails when it comes to its budget. What ruined it for me was that sloppy zoom-in effect that's relied on as a crutch the entire movie. The Tuskegee airmen will be in the midst of a heated air battle with the Germans. The camera would pan up to try and capture the action, but it would zoom-in (or out on a few occasions) nearly every time to try and show you who should be keeping track of. It just came off as sloppy camera work to me, as if they didn't have the proper camera placement for the scene and tried to adjust it accordingly. There are several things that don't really add up in the movie either. One of the main ones for me was that at one point, Easy tells everyone that there's no time to celebrate a completed mission and to return to base because they're low on fuel. But can you guess what they do in the very next scene? They showboat and celebrate. Not listening to your superiors and still getting praised for it is an overbearing theme in the movie, as well.George Lucas fought for 23 years to get this made, but after viewing it you'll more than likely be convinced that the man has grown senile over the years and that retirement from Hollywood is the best thing for him. The turnout for the screening was insane and you can bet that Red Tails will more than likely make a killing at the box office, but there's no way in hell it passes as a good or even decent piece of cinema. Amateur cinematography, a boring script, terrible acting, and the fate of certain characters being extremely predictable (you can guess Lightning's fate around the time things start getting serious with Sophia), Red Tails is the equivalent of a stand-up act that gets booed off the stage. It is just awful. I was left wishing the entire movie was just Cuba Gooding Jr lifting a pipe to his lips, pulling it away, and pretending to smoke the entire film. If it was just those clips strung together with no dialogue and that dubstep track from the TV spot in the background, I could have at least gotten a good laugh out of it.",1,Flawed in every sense of

1464396,A3C1Q9TRP83BYB,B005LAIGN2,Daniel A. Brown,"[7, 17]","Combining the themes of ""Glory"" with ""Memphis Belle"", this film tells, what is now, the well-known and still inspiring story of the 332nd Fighter Group, the famed Tuskegee Airmen. Although fighting in a segregated armed forces and judged inferior by the racism of the era, the Airmen compiled one of the more enviable fighting records of the USAAF. Although most of their missions involved the un-sexy work of providing cover for heavy bomber raids, only 25 bombers were lost during the hundreds of missions during which they were stewarded by the 332nd.The film itself must be judged in two categories, the acting and the action scenes. The latter win out as the aerial battle scenes at times take your breath away and look realistic enough to make you feel like a wingman. Anyone who loves WWII aircraft will thrill to see the Me-262, the first operational jet fighter, mixing it up with the P-51's of the Red Tails. And, as a point of interest, the Red Tails DID destroy a German warship as depicted in the film.Unfortunately, the movie deserves the blasting it has gotten over the wooden acting and rote screenplay. Everyone is a tad too heroic (Cuba Gooding Jr. looks ready to break his teeth by the way he clamps his pipe) and the white airmen are a bit too solicitous for the realities of the 1940's. Despite his billing, Bryan Cranston is virtually non-existent, although David Oyelowo projects some fine stage presence. There are enough cast members present from ""The Wire"" (Andre Royo, Tristan Wilds) to make you wish that Omar Little would appear, in his own plane (with its own markings) and possibly shooting both Americans and Germans out of the sky in his unique anarchic way.Speaking of Germans, the Messerschmitts are led by a stereotypically evil Nazi who just before his demise, utters (so help me, god) ""DIE, YOU FOOLISH AFRICAN!"" one of the strangest lines ever put to celluloid. Go see ""Red Tails"" with profoundly low expectations and you won't be disappointed.

Here is the rundown- not a single scene in this ""historically inspired"" movie (other than the racism) is remotely accurate. This is Lucasfilm filming the Rebel Alliance fighting the evil Imperial TIE fighters again. the combat scenes aren't even remotely representative of reality: aircrews did not talk to each other the way they do in this movie (training takes over and pilots know what to do- they don't spend half a minute deciding to make a turn so that the wingman can take out the German because in that half a minute the fight will be over and the pilot who is busy thinking sand discussing tactics will be dead), fighter escorts did not abandon bomber formations until the ""Red Tails"" showed up.  (Until the P-51 Mustangs appeared on the scene, of course, fighters did not have the range to escort bombers all the way to their targets anyway.) German fighters did not attack bomber formations as a tight group of 10-20 fighters (a nice tight bunch to shoot at ensuring that at least some of the German fighters would be downed by bomber gunners on the pass). In the early part of the movie American P-40s down several ME-109s. This would only have happened if the ME-109s were piloted by the worst pilots in the Luftwaffe and the P-40s were flown by the best American pilots: the ME-109s were faster and more agile by far, and had far superior climbing rates (the P-40 was obsolete before the War began). There is a scene where the inchoate Red Tails destroy a Luftwaffe base. The base looked like something out of the 1960s, not like an aerodrome of WWII. Of course the German pilots are wooden, souless killers devoid of emotion. The Red Tails themselves do not act like officers or even enlistedmen- never do we lose the sense that they are actors as they are devoid of all military bearing. Individual B-17s turn out of formation and head for home with battle damage - not a surer way for the pilot of the B-17 to commit suicide or at least guarantee the loss of aircraft ( a lone B-17 would stand no chance as German fighters had cannon that could shoot at the bommbers beyond the range of the machine guns of the bombers- only by staying in formation and covering each other could the bombers hope to survive their missions).Why couldn't Lucasfilm have taken the truly inspiring story of the Tuskeegee airmen and filmed a movie that reflected the reality of air combat??  This movie makes a mockery of a very important chapter of race relations in America ( the begining of the end of a very sad and disgraceful chpater of American history) I would say it's conection to reality is about the same as Hogan's Heroe  and McHale's Navy- maybe worse because it pretends to be accurate.Advice- buy the DVd very used (under $5 at least) or watch in pay per view- if you really have two hours of your life that you want to waste watching this and feel strongly that you will not resent the fact that you will never get those two hours back!",1,Possibly the worst movie about WWII ever made.,1337904000,"05 25, 2012",2012,2989,"['have', 'just', 'rented', 'movie', 'cable', 'Here', 'rundown-', 'not', 'single', 'scene', 'historically', 'inspired', 'movie', 'other', 'racism', 'remotely', 'accurate', 'Lucasfilm', 'filming', 'Rebel', 'Alliance', 'fighting', 'evil', 'Imperial', 'TIE', 'fighters', 'again', 'combat', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'remotely', 'representative', 'reality', 'aircrews', 'did', 'not', 'talk', 'other', 'way', 'do', 'movie', 'training', 'pilots', 'know', 'what', 'do-', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'minute', 'deciding', 'make', 'turn', 'so', 'wingman', 'can', 'take', 'out', 'German', 'minute', 'fight', 'will', 'be', 'pilot', 'who', 'busy', 'thinking', 'sand', 'discussing', 'tactics', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'fighter', 'escorts', 'did', 'not', 'abandon', 'bomber', 'formations', 'Red', 'Tails', 'showed', 'up', 'P-51', 'Mustangs', 'appeared', 'scene', 'course', 'fighters', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'range', 'escort', 'bombers', 'way', 'targets', 'anyway', 'German', 'fighters', 'did', 'not', 'attack', 'bomber', 'formations', 'tight', 'group', '10-20', 'fighters', 'nice', 'tight', 'bunch', 'shoot', 'ensuring', 'least', 'German', 'fighters', 'would', 'be', 'downed', 'bomber', 'gunners', 'pass', 'early', 'part', 'movie', 'American', 'P-40s', 'several', 'ME-109s', 'would', 'only', 'have', 'happened', 'ME-109s', 'were', 'piloted', 'worst', 'pilots', 'Luftwaffe', 'P-40s', 'were', 'flown', 'best', 'American', 'pilots', 'ME-109s', 'were', 'faster', 'more', 'agile', 'far', 'had', 'far', 'superior', 'climbing', 'rates', 'P-40', 'was', 'obsolete', 'War', 'began', 'scene', 'where', 'inchoate', 'Red', 'Tails', 'Luftwaffe', 'base', 'base', 'looked', 'something', '1960s', 'not', 'aerodrome', 'WWII', 'course', 'German', 'pilots', 'are', 'wooden', 'souless', 'killers', 'devoid', 'emotion', 'Red', 'Tails', 'do', 'not', 'act', 'officers', 'even', 'enlistedmen-', 'never', 'do', 'lose', 'sense', 'are', 'actors', 'are', 'devoid', 'military', 'bearing', 'Individual', 'B-17s', 'turn', 'formation', 'head', 'home', 'battle', 'damage', 'not', 'surer', 'way', 'pilot', 'B-17', 'commit', 'suicide', 'least', 'guarantee', 'loss', 'aircraft', 'lone', 'B-17', 'would', 'stand', 'chance', 'German', 'fighters', 'had', 'cannon', 'could', 'shoot', 'bommbers', 'range', 'machine', 'guns', 'bombers-', 'only', 'staying', 'formation', 'covering', 'other', 'could', 'bombers', 'hope', 'survive', 'missions', '.Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'Lucasfilm', 'have', 'taken', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'story', 'Tuskeegee', 'airmen', 'filmed', 'movie', 'reflected', 'reality', 'air', 'combat', 'movie', 'mockery', 'very', 'important', 'chapter', 'race', 'relations', 'America', 'begining', 'end', 'very', 'sad', 'disgraceful', 'chpater', 'American', 'history', 'would', 'say', 'conection', 'reality', 'same', 'Hogan', 'Heroe', 'McHale', 'Navy-', 'maybe', 'worse', 'be', 'accurate.Advice-', 'buy', 'DVd', 'very', 'used', '5', 'least', 'watch', 'pay', 'view-', 'really', 'have', 'two', 'hours', 'life', 'want', 'waste', 'watching', 'feel', 'strongly', 'will', 'not', 'resent', 'fact', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'two', 'hours', 'back']",N/A

There has never been a group of airmen that have been given the amount of filmstock as have the black pilots that made up this squadron. One would think that they alone defeated the Luftwaffe. For goodness sake anyone in that theater of war flying the later model P51 would have met with great success against the relatively obsolete aircraft that the Luftwaffe fielded in the latter part of the war (with the rare exception of the Germans superb jet aircraft that simply arrived too late and in too few numbers to ""turn the tide"" toward the Germans in the air.The Germans also suffered from the massive loss of experienced pilots during the last couple of years of the Great War because of idiotic war policies created by politicians rather than military men, much like the United States has done in every conflict we have been engaged in since 1945.

1464415,AHPV4F8IVSC39,B005LAIGN2,"Douglas B. Moran ""Computer+History/Politics""","[1, 2]","2-stars for being a poor, but not un-watchable, aerial combat movie. I was strongly tempted to deduct a star for bad treatment of Tuskegee Airmen's story, but that didn't seem fair since Hollywood routinely ignores the compelling elements of a story in favor of a distorted, hackneyed,formulaic treatment.1. Failure as an aerial combat movie:Anyone who has seen even a modest amount of actual WW2 aerial combat footage will alternate between a series of negative emotions: derisive laughter, groaning, and anger at being treated so contemptuously by this movie's makers. The CGI is heavily influenced by the style and technique of first-person-shooter videogames, but it is so over-the-top visually that any serious gamer would reject it as cartoonish -- lacking any sense of realism. Particularly absurd, the movie treats steel, including armor plating, as having the same explosive potential as vaporized gasoline -- one .50-cal bullet hits it and there is a towering fireball. And the tactics swing between nonsense and hilarious stupidity (but one should know not to expect better from George Lucas).The only faintly realistic part of the movie is that it treats the Germans as the same cartoonish, wooden villains as did the propaganda comic books of that era.2. Failure as a story of the Tuskegee Airmen:The movie fails to give any sense of the importance of their accomplishments (instead citing medals). The movie shows a bomber crew offering to buy drinks for some Red Tails, as a casual ""nice job"" acknowledgement. This trivializes what happened. The Red Tails so excelled as escorts that bomber groups lobbied hard to have them assigned to their missions. And their reputation became such that their mere presence produced a substantial boost to the morale of the bomber crews. Without effective fighter escort, the bombing campaign would have been severely limited -- the costs of many targets would have been prohibitive. The movie presents the Red Tails as reducing the number of bomber crews killed, instead of them enabling those bombers to deliver heavy blows to the German war machine.The challenges the Tuskegee Airmen faced are only lightly touched upon: With only a few trivial modifications to the script, this movie could have had an all-white cast. The biggest failing is that the movie gives no sense of how this experience turned the elite of the Negro community -- many of the pilots qualified for the military program because of pilot training in a civilian program at Tuskegee University -- into part of the elite of American society. What the movie shows is generic ""frat boy"" behavior, but when you listen to the accounts of the actual pilots what you hear is how aware they were of the importance of what they were doing and the disastrous effects if they failed. And of the habits of focus, discipline and toughness it reinforced that served them so well later.The movie lacks any of the foreshadowing of the important people that many of these pilots would become. The DVD's extras include interviews with some of the airmen, but I didn't notice it covering anything I hadn't already seen elsewhere. Plus, ""extras"" are supposed to be that, rather than (partially) remedial for the failings of the primary product (the feature movie).-- Douglas B.

Some of the script is a bit staid and corny, and a few plot details are a little hard to buy, e.g., a P-40 coming out unscathed after single-handedly destroying a German warship? Still, even the blatantly inaccurate parts of the film are very gripping, a quality that most of us want, right?RED TAILS is carefully and expertly filmed but has a sort of 70ish war thriller ambiance to it.

Did anyone else notice these pilots NEVER used their goggles?  Even the pilot who had fuel pouring into his cockpit didn't use his goggles.  Ridiculous!Then the CG.  If I'm not mistaken, I think the jeeps in the film were real, and a plane here and there.  The CG was overused and too obvious.The music score, IMO, was just weird.  I don't think it flowed at all.The acting was just ok.  There were some good action sequences.  Personally, I think that German pilot did his part better than anyone.Lastly, I was actually expecting a cameo appearance by Bruce Willis and Steve McQueen.

This isn't an earth shakingly great film, but it is no where near as bad as reviewers made out. What it is is an enjoyable war film that probably works better on the small screen than on the big.While the movie does cover issues with prejudice from white officers and conflict with the Germans, it is a war picture, red tails strikes out on its own by focusing more on the internal battles the men fight. They know they are in the spot light from racists officers in their own service who want to shut them out and they don't want to be the one who lets the side down. While the characters are recognizable stock characters Red Tails focuses on their inner demons, youth, discipline, drink etc wanting to be accepted and respected for what they do than the external battles and this is done very well.George Lucas put a lot of his own money into Red Tails and got most of the grief for this but he didn't write or direct it. He just supplied the studio and support for a story he, rightly, felt should be told.What doesn't work in the story  are some bad historical mistakes which make no sense- such as the landing strip for planes going right through the middle of camp-where a crash will take out building/tents/people/small farm animals, or planes on the field being parked side by side. It looks pretty but the US learned at a place called Pearl Harbor how badly that could go if attacked. There are a few more like this that don't exactly ruin the film but are so clumsy for the knowledgeable viewer that it gets in the way. Far worse is the CGI affects of the planes. Some look good but all too often they look less like a sky full of planes than a video game promo, in other words as a shocker coming from the primo f/x shop in the world, the f/x is the biggest failing.In some ways it is impossible not to think of other, generally better films, approaching many of these same topics as you watch Red Tails. For example when one hot head is being told off for picking fights with white officers, you think ""Morgan Freeman did this better in Glory"" and so on. But on its own red tails is an interesting entry to a field of men at war and does have a story of its own to tell.",3,Deserved a better reception in theatres than it got,1340668800,"06 26, 2012",2012,2470,"['Red', 'Tails', 'based', 'adventures', 'first', 'group', 'black', 'fighter', 'pilots', 'US', 'military', 'known', 'history', 'Tuskegee', 'Airmen', 'was', 'brought', 'world', 'George', 'Lucas', 'roundly', 'trounced', 'box', 'office', 'reviews', 'having', 'sat', 'really', 'was', 'too', 'bad', ""n't"", 'earth', 'shakingly', 'great', 'film', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'bad', 'reviewers', 'made', 'out', 'What', 'enjoyable', 'war', 'film', 'probably', 'better', 'small', 'screen', 'big.While', 'movie', 'cover', 'issues', 'prejudice', 'white', 'officers', 'conflict', 'Germans', 'war', 'picture', 'red', 'tails', 'out', 'own', 'focusing', 'more', 'internal', 'men', 'fight', 'know', 'are', 'spot', 'light', 'racists', 'officers', 'own', 'service', 'who', 'want', 'shut', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'one', 'who', 'side', 'down', 'characters', 'are', 'recognizable', 'stock', 'characters', 'Red', 'Tails', 'inner', 'demons', 'youth', 'discipline', 'drink', 'etc', 'wanting', 'be', 'accepted', 'respected', 'what', 'do', 'external', 'battles', 'done', 'very', 'well.George', 'Lucas', 'put', 'lot', 'own', 'money', 'Red', 'Tails', 'got', 'most', 'grief', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'direct', 'just', 'supplied', 'studio', 'support', 'story', 'rightly', 'felt', 'should', 'be', 'told.What', ""n't"", 'work', 'story', 'are', 'bad', 'historical', 'mistakes', 'make', 'sense-', 'such', 'landing', 'strip', 'planes', 'going', 'right', 'middle', 'camp-where', 'crash', 'will', 'take', 'out', 'farm', 'animals', 'planes', 'field', 'being', 'parked', 'side', 'side', 'pretty', 'US', 'learned', 'place', 'called', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'how', 'badly', 'could', 'go', 'attacked', 'are', 'few', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'ruin', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'clumsy', 'knowledgeable', 'viewer', 'way', 'Far', 'worse', 'CGI', 'affects', 'planes', 'look', 'good', 'too', 'often', 'look', 'less', 'sky', 'full', 'planes', 'video', 'game', 'promo', 'other', 'words', 'shocker', 'coming', 'primo', 'f/x', 'shop', 'world', 'f/x', 'biggest', 'failing.In', 'ways', 'impossible', 'not', 'think', 'other', 'generally', 'better', 'films', 'approaching', 'many', 'same', 'topics', 'watch', 'Red', 'Tails', 'example', 'when', 'one', 'hot', 'head', 'being', 'told', 'off', 'picking', 'fights', 'white', 'officers', 'think', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'did', 'better', 'Glory', 'so', 'own', 'red', 'tails', 'interesting', 'entry', 'field', 'men', 'war', 'have', 'story', 'own', 'tell']",N/A

Tried it out nonetheless.Moments of hardcore laughter, moments of poignant sadness, great, gritty, realistic special effects, showing there's more to war than what most would think about, this film I very well enjoyed, even if I don't know the whole story behind this story.Cuba Gooding, Jr. was great at his role (if not perfect) alongside Terrence Howard (he did better in this than he did in Iron Man by a far shot) and several actors I've never seen before. Many of them were flat-out great at what they did, others seemed a bit one-dimensional (don't some human beings?).So, historically, who takes the most flak?

It is based on the exploits of an Army Air Corps wing staffed by African American men from the Tuskegee training program. We see what a challenge it was for them to find acceptance by fellow military officers, the frustration they encountered because they were issued equipment discarded by other groups and the pride they developed as a much-decorated and highly honored American squadron that contributed to the Allied victory in WWII. I'm happy to see the DVD is available with Amazon.com.Based on a story by John Ridley (lots of TV) and produced by George Lucas (""Star Wars""), this well-meaning film has plenty of action and humor, but the weak dialogue by Aaron McGruder (""The Boondocks"") left me shaking my head. Anachronisms abounded: ""Man up,"" ""Get your mojo back,"" and ""Stay with me"" (to a wounded airman), sounded more like 2012, not the 1940s.This cast did a fine job despite the script's many shortcomings:* Bryan Cranston (""Breaking Bad"") does a quick cameo as a racist officer.* Cuba Gooding Jr. (""The Hit List"") smokes a pipe here to give his character gravitas. He is a fair-minded officer who wants his men to succeed and understands the importance of morale.* Terrence Howard (""The Brave One"") is the officer who does battle for his men at headquarters. He negotiates for new fighter planes and meaningful assignments.* David Oyelowo (""The Help"") brings dash and sex appeal to his character; he's the daredevil who wants to fly that extra sortie and who can spot a beautiful woman from the air. This British-born actor is sensational!* Daniela Ruah (""NCIS: Los Angeles"") is the lovely Italian woman our eagle-eyed lover boy spots.Full disclosure: I'm a former pilot, so I saw illogical scenes that bothered me, but those same scenes might very well be thrilling to a less picky viewer. This is a war movie, so expect male bonding, blood, plenty of dogfights and LOTS of blowie uppie stuff.Executive producer George Lucas (who personally funded this movie) said in an interview that this project is to celebrate heroes largely forgotten by America, and to offer an opportunity to a galaxy of black actors too often ignored.

Chambers,"[2, 2]","There are few English language World War II movies that I haven't seen, so I didn't hesitate to see ""Red Tails"" on opening day, especially after I had seen a couple of trailers. Red Tails is an action-filled drama about the Tuskegee Airmen who flew from bases in Italy during 1944-1945. The movie covered the Red Tails from their ground attack missions in obsolete P-40 aircraft through their success in escorting B-17 bombers on missions deep into Germany, flying their hot new P-51 Mustangs. The flying scenes were as realistic as CGI can get.The acting was very good, especially considering the action-driven nature of the movie. Cuba Gooding Jr. and Terrence Howard were excellent as the leaders of the 332nd Fighter Group. Nate Parker and David Oyelowo played tent-mates; Parker played ""Easy,"" and Oyelowo was ""Lightning."" They were friends and wingmates, but they seemed to be in a race to destruction, with Easy hitting the booze too hard, and Lightning too reckless for his own good.My only negative comments - and they're minor - are that the language wasn't very realistic, but that was obviously to get a PG-13 rating. Also, some of the phrases, such as ""man up"" and ""we're good"" weren't around until a few decades later.And in a scene where Lightning singlehandedly attacks a German ""destroyer"" near the Italian coast, the ship is obviously bigger than a destroyer, it looked more like a light cruiser.But those are minor quibbles.

The Tuskegee Airmen were an all-negro unit.  Thus, they were relegated to second-rate aircraft and flew missions of little importance.  But, due to the efforts of Colonel Bullard (Howard), the Tuskegee Airman soon found themselves at the forefront of the air war over Europe.The Tuskegees were given the opportunity to fly bomber escort.  The caveat was that they were to remain close to the bombers throughout the mission.  Given brand-new P-51 Mustangs, the Tuskegee Airmen soon made a name for themselves with both the grateful bomber crews and the German pilots.This is an excellent movie.  I originally saw it in the theater and I bought the DVD copy.  The acting is very good, and David Oyelowo (Lightning), Nate Parker (Easy), Terrence Howard (Colonel Bullard), and Cuba Gooding Jr. all give fine performances.  The special effects and air combat scenes are what make this movie so good.  It was thrilling to watch the B-17s, P-51s, and ME-109s fighting it out.  The other action scenes, including the attack on the German train and air base are exciting as well.I give this fine movie my highest recommendation.

A small handful of German fighters strafe the bombers and the American fighter pilots all takeoff in pursuit to shoot down the Germans. The decoy worked as the balance of the German fighters come in and easily shoot down many of the bombers who are not without fighter plane protection.The Tuskegee Airmen are stationed in Italy in 1944 and their duties include flying patrols and shooting the random military transport they happen to find.  They long for real action at the front and the opportunity for air to air combat with the Germans.  They are perceived by the top brass to be an experiment and incompetent soldiers who are given older style P40 planes to use only for political reasons.Colonel A. J. Howard is at the Pentagon arguing with his superiors that the men deserve a fighting chance to prove themselves in real battle but he is running against racial prejudice and egos....This is a full on action war film that has some really good air battles in it that are worth viewing.  The storyline is just OK and the acting is in my opinion very good.  Unfortunately many of the historical facts are twisted and the characters in the film are fictional.  The story of the Tuskegee airmen is a true story of some of the heroes of WWII.  What I didn't like were the depictions of:* A pilot almost asleep in the cockpit while flying a mission.* A Captain leader who is a drunk and goes into every battle after drinking.* A Lieutenant who didn't follow orders multiple times.* Showing fighter pilots abandoning bomber squadrons so they can get a kill and allow bomber crews to die unprotected.There were other items but these are creative writing in the script that could have been done without.Nevertheless there is enough truth in the movie that allows it to be seen and tell of the bravery of these men who fought for their country.  At the end of the movie it states:* They all get the distinguished Presidential Unit Citation for performance against the enemy.* The Tuskegee airmen had one of the best records of any air fighter group in WW II. By the end of the war, 66 were killed in action.The movie sold fewer tickets at the box office that it cost to make.  It was totally financed by George Lucas as he could get no funding from Hollywood for a movie with a primarily black cast.  Lucas also gave a generous grant donation to the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. to create a website honoring the pilots.

This is the more uplifting of the two.The Second World War was a time when the world changed radically, then changed radically again, and then again, and on and on for almost six years.  This was true not only geopolitically (three of the world's major powers destroyed, two others risen to a new category of ""superpower"") and technologically (the transition from prop plane to jet, from TNT to U-235), but culturally as well.People often talk about the regimentation required by war, but too often fail to notice how a war can force a country to give up some kinds of regimentation, such as sexism and racial segregation.  Rosie the Riveter is  a feminist icon today even more than during the war, and the ""Double Victory"" the Red Tails fought for is still worthy of celebration.This is a story worth being told, and it is told very well with superior scripting, acting and special effects.  Even if your only interest in the Tuskeegee Airmen is in the planes they flew, there's plenty of that here.

The story is great and the heroism is there but the rest of the story/movie is way over the top. As someone who has had the honour of meeting former Tuskegee airmen I can tell you that I am deeply disappointed in how little thought must have been given to producing and making this motion picture. So many errors and technical glitches plus an array of make-believe fibs that don't fit in the real story of those men. In one scene, the white bomber pilot praises black fighters for their good job over 'Polesti' which he must have meant 'Ploesti' in Romania. Then there is a scene on top of the ATC tower where the black sgt. says 'Roger that, sir' which is not how troops responded to orders in 1940s. 'Roger' is a modern mil-speak invention. I might be wrong on that so feel free to correct me. Then there is the unnecessary romance cliche. Do they want us to believe this BS? One has to take the aerial dogfight scenes with a grain of salt. The B-17 wouldn't have had structural failures like those shown in the movie just after a few hits. It would have taken a lot more to bring down a 'Fort'.

The best thing about the disc isn't the theatrical film itself but ""Double Victory: The Tuskegee Airmen at War,""  the 1 hour documentary ""extra.""  While the theatrical film addresses some of the history of the courageous Tuskegee airmen, the documentary focuses of the ""second war"" back in the United States.  Using excellent interviews with many of the survivors of the Red Tails and their African-American bomber crew confederates, many of the injustices they lived through are fleshed out.  They are supplemented by some remarkable film footage from the time.  These great Americans effectively launched the Civil Rights movement even before Jackie Robinson integrated baseball or Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat.The next best thing about this film is the aerial combat photography, some of which is done with real planes and real pilots and some is done with some amazing CGI and George Lucas's technicians.  I was especially taken with the introduction of some early German jet fighters as they engaged the Red Tails' P-51 Mustangs.  The other big positive is the magnificent transfer to Blu ray.  From the opening scenes the film sparkles in this Lucas authorized release.  The colors are bright and vivid.  The textures are finely tuned, especially in close ups.  The audio likewise is demo ready.  As you might expect, the audio is an important feature with planes shooting at each other all over the Italian and German skies.  In addition to the aforementioned documentary, other extras include comments by Lucas and director Anthony Hemingway, composer Terrance Blanchard and the cast.  There is also a 5 minute feature at how the CGI came into play.  The film and the extras are in 1080p with the film shown in a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.Unfortunately the film itself isn't so good.  While the actors in key roles are fine, some of the secondary actors come off like bumpkins or amateurs.  Of course some of the cornball dialog they are given is equally bad.  In a few sequences when the Red Tails are escorting bombers flown by a white crew, the bomber pilots make some of the most ridiculous comments that I had to laugh.  I don't know if this was done intentionally or not but it comes across as just dumb.  There are also a couple scenes with the black pilots that slang terms and pronunciations are spoken that were not used in 1944.  What is important is that this story got visibility with this film.

In this version though, the storytelling is alas so clunky, that no end of beautifully photographed postcard Italy and shoehorned romantic subplot or inserted action scenes can rescue it.  There is a good looking cast and some genuine production values, but saddled with a script which from the opening scene seems amateurish and contrived, sapping the movie of the genuine awe and respect of the airmens achievements that they deserve.  Cuba Gooding Junior needs to find something gritty to rebuild his career, and Terence Howard survives the movie with some dignity and gravitas, but the lines and situations they are given to handle  are flat and artificial.  The movie charts the pilots in the squadron, trying to show their different ways of handling the stress, while building up from their initial delegating of trivial flying tasks to their escorting of bombers to Berlin, against a squadron (!) of German jet fighters.  There is less a plot, more a series of subplots charting the evolution of the squadron - and some of those subplots just go nowhere.  When one of the pilots was captured and we see him arrive at a PoW camp, I thought this was finally going to show what it meant to be of African American descent under German control, but no - the moment is squandered.  If the script is handled in screenwriting 101 style, it isn't helped by the lack of weight in the effects - you'd have to say on the face of it, that the planes actually look very well rendered.. it's hard to imagine improvements in what cgi could do - and yet... they just don't look real, and the physics of how they are thrown around the sky doesn't look real either.

Two of them end up straffing a Nazi warship and killing hundreds (never mind the fact that German Navy NEVER LEFT PORT after 1943, with the exception of the U-boats)The godlike airmen attack a German airbase in a pair of slow, outmoded P-40s. We can see the ground guns scattered all over the place. They would have been shot down IN THE FIRST PASS.The Airmen down several Me-262 jet fighters in this film, one of them in a face-to-face duel (okay, ONCE a Tuskeegee airman shot down a 262 using an absolutely incredible maneuver shown in the film. I HOPE he won a medal). But according to Chuck Yeager, who flew the same skies and fought the same enemy, virtually ALL 262s were shot down as they attempted to land at their airbases. The Nazi jet planes were too fast to stop otherwise, even for P-51s (and despite the Messerschmit's lousy turning rate).A Tuskeegee Airman gets captured by Nazis, escapes, and is returned to his unit. Sorry but this NEVER happened. If you were shot down and escaped, you were sent to ANOTHER THEATER OF WAR to insure that if you were captured again you couldn't reveal to the enemy the identity of the French/Italian/Greek/Romanian/whatever Resistance fighters who got you to Allied lines.That said, the gear, machines, and planes you see are portrayed pretty accurately and the CGI was incredible. The action is cool if overplayed.

I'd been counting down the days to see the film and it just so happened to be a huge snowstorm tonight in Chicago (six inches and counting), but I was so determined to see this film that I simply didn't care. If I had to march to see it, I was going to march, fall and slide all the way there but I was going to show my support opening night. And I did. And after I finished watching the film, I thought, ""I want to see this movie again. How quickly can I return to the show?""I know the backstory of how hard it was to get this two decade old film in theaters. I definitely appreciate George Lucas for bringing this film to the big screen. Even better I think it's cool that so many actors who weren't as popular in films (even if they were great on TV) got to show their movie chops, like Tristan Wilds (""90210,"" ""The Wire"") and music artists like Ne-Yo and Method Man. I was already a big fan of Nate Parker from ""The Killer Bees"" movie and ""The Great Debaters,"" so I knew he'd be good. Same deal with Terrence Howard. I only knew Marcus T. Paulk as the little brother on the TV show ""Moesha."" I didn't know a thing about David Oyelowo, Elijah Kelley, Michael B. Jordan or Leslie Odom Jr. And while I knew of Cuba Gooding Jr., I hadn't really been a fan of any of his work since ""Boyz in the Hood"" so I went in not really knowing what to expect, other than looking at some incredibly attractive brothas who may or may not have been able to pull this movie off.By now we know the story of the Tuskegee Airmen. Those who know their history know how black soldiers were treated, and if you've seen the documentary or the movie with Laurence Fishburne, you may wonder, ""Why would they make remake a film that's already been covered?"" I remember seeing the Fishburne film when I was a kid, but I don't remember whether I liked it or not. I think I did, but I'll have to revisit it. What I do know is these guys all pulled equal weight in this film. The ""stars"" played the background and let the rookies be the stars, and the rookies really showed off their acting chops. I think they represented the history and the plot well. I think the humor may fall flat on those who don't know characters like these in real life, but for those of us who know the ""black Jesus"" guy, you'll get it. And I definitely know a few of David Oyelowo's characters. There's been some criticism about how an officer would keep rebelling against a higher officer, but keep in mind that these guys were fighting for not just a war but their reputation, too. I related to Oyelowo's character more than any of the rest of them.The only downside I found in the whole movie was how unbelievable Ne-Yo's accent was. I thought Method Man was going to have a problem toning down a thick East Coast accent, but he did a much better job of disguising his than Ne-Yo did trying to have a southern accent. Other than that, I loved the whole film and highly recommend it.

That's right, the movie is nothing more than a two hour extension of the three minute trailer. The film consists of nothing more than a lot of CGI aerial dogfights, no character development, little historical reference, and absolutely nothing engaging.The movie, executive produced by effects guru George Lucas, begins in mid-battle and never seems to land, there is no attempt to set up a story. The characters are interchangeable, the dialogue painful to hear, it's right out of the cliched WWII efforts of the actual era. The movie never has a thought or a point to make, the historical elements are quickly glanced over like cliff notes, the picture barely touches on the key racial elements of the pilots conflict with the American air force.Everything about this movie is a mess, even the casting is all wrong. The usually reliable Terence Howard is miscast, too soft spoken and polite too really grab the audience, or the men under his command for that matter, by the throat and drill into them the cause that they are working towards. There needs to be something more invested in this movie by the filmmakers if they have any hope of getting the audience into this flick. It doesn't even successfully pander to the audience.There is a much better 1995 HBO telefilmThe Tuskegee Airmen, that while still flawed at least hits a number of the marks and paints a far more accurate and engaging portrait of these often forgotten American heroes. It is interesting to note that Cuba Gooding, Jr. appears in both of these films, he was also in Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbor"" which is the movie that ""Red Tails"" most resembles.

The ME 262 suffered from mechcanical problems and they were shot down mostly by pure luck and having engine problems.

The Tuskegee Airmen were real, they did serve with distinction, and there was discrimination and segregation.However, George Lucas unnecessarily dumbed down the story - ostensibly for dramatic effect? - to a degree that I found extremely annoying. I might have forgiven the clich&eacute;d and one-dimensional depiction of the German fighters as not merely racist but also evil. The Americans may have been racist, but they were not evil. :-) But I can't forgive the depiction of the white American fighters as unrepentant glory seekers who abandon their bomber squadrons - time and time again - in order to pursue a few decoy German fighters. This film implies that the only reason the all-black 332nd Fighter Group was given the opportunity to escort a bomber squadron was because white escorts were not reliable. The film also implies that when bomber squadrons had white escorts there were far more casualties, but with the 332nd there were very few or none. Indeed, there was one scene showing how surprised the bomber pilots were that the black fighters were not going to abandon them as the white fighters would.Now, if there is ANY truth to this, that white fighters were not reliable and often abandoned the bomber squadrons they were supposed to protect, then I will apologize and revise my review. But I see this as a huge red flag that history is not just being dramatized, or revised, but mangled. By stooping so low, Lucas isn't honoring the distinguished Tuskegee Airmen.P.S. I wonder if the folks who are giving me negative votes could tell me why in the comments section? I'm curious.

1464586,A4JHEO7H330AF,B005LAIGN2,Tom Brody,"[1, 1]","RED TAILS concerns only part of the story of the pilots known as the Tuskegee Airmen, the combat missions.  This film does not concern any aspect of the recruitment or training of the pilots.  While racial issues are presented throughout, they are disclosed only in a manner that is somewhat tangential.  The opening minutes of this movie consist of phony-looking computer graphics of flying formations.  Thus, in order to tolerate this movie, which contains an abundant quantity of CG-generated flying scenes, I suggest the viewer pretend that he is watching a STAR WARS movie.  For any person who has watched WWII movies that were filmed during the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, and so on, the combat scenes, hardware (airplanes and guns), prison camp escape, and love story with a local Italian woman, will be familiar ground.  Many of the scenes were already familiar to me, since I had already seen THE GREAT ESCAPE (part of RED TAILS was copied from Great Escape), TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH (part of RED TAILS was copied from this film), MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT (part of RED TAILS was copied from this film).  RED TAILS includes some stories-within-a-story, but so do many films and television shows.  The stories-within-a-story include the fact that one of the airmen likes to chug from his liquor flask and the resulting questions about his ability to function optimally.  Another story-within-a-story is the fact that one of the airmen falls in love with an Italian woman, and there is an amusing scene where the mother of the Italian woman plants herself in between the couple on their first date.RED TAILS COMPARED WITH THE TUSKEEGEE AIRMEN.  RED TAILS is not really a compelling film, for three reasons.  First, as mentioned above, many elements were cobbled together from existing movies.  Second, the computer graphics looked phony.  Third, the film called THE TUSKEEGEE AIRMEN is by far the superior movie.  THE TUSKEEGEE AIRMEN, starring Laurence Fishburne, Cuba Gooding, Andre Braughner (leadership role), and John Lithgow (redneck congressman), is far superior, for the following reasons.  All of the elements of the Fishburne movie are part of a coherent and integrated whole. For example, the episode with Eleanor Roosevelt was intended to disclose the overcoming of racial prejudice.  The episode where the airmen landed on a country road in America was intended to disclose the overcoming of racial prejudice.  The episodes with Lithgow were intended to disclose the overcoming of racial prejudice.  The episode where the redneck from Texas decides that he wants his bombers to be protected by the Tuskegee pilots, is one of the most stirring moments in the history of American cinema.In  contrast, RED TAILS does not have much of a point, except to transfer money from the public to a company located in the former Letterman Hospital in San Francisco.  The Fishburne movie has plenty of soul-stirring moments while, in contrast, RED TAILS merely provides amusement.  About three quarters of the time of the Fishburne movie concerns the recruitment, training, and comradery of the airmen, and about one quarter concerns combat.  In contrast, the primary source of character development in RED TAILS, is the peripheral story the Italian girlfriend.  Please also note that THE TUSKEEGEE AIRMEN is ensemble piece, where Cuba Gooding is one of the main actors while, in contrast, Cuba Gooding plays an extremely small role in RED TAILS.  First of all, this is deceptive and misrepresentational. Second of all, it appears that the goal of the motion picture company is to confuse the public into thinking that RED TAILS is the only movie (or anyway, the preferred movie) that concerns the Tuskeegee pilots.DECEPTION.  I took off another STAR because the representation of this product by Lucasfilms is deceptive.  The advertisements for RED TAILS proclaimed that this is the first movie about the Tuskeegee Airmen.  This is false.  The movie with Laurence Fishburne came seventeen years earlier. Secondly, the advertisements for RED TAILS proclaim that this movie stars Cuba Gooding.  This is incorrect.  Although Mr. Gooding is in this film, he plays a role that is minor, inconsequential, and dispensable.  Third, this movie is also deceptive because Lucasfilms attempts to confuse the public by including Cuba Gooding in this movie (RED TAILS) when the same actor (Mr. Gooding) had played a major role in the earlier movie, THE TUSKEEGEE AIRMEN.  This is deceptive, because the goal is to confuse people, who have heard about the original film, into thinking that this is the original film.  These three facts demonstrate that Lucasfilms has attempted to deceive the public.",2,"Not bad, never dull, and not particularly inspirational",1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,4684,"['RED', 'TAILS', 'concerns', 'only', 'part', 'story', 'pilots', 'known', 'Tuskegee', 'Airmen', 'combat', 'missions', 'film', 'not', 'concern', 'aspect', 'recruitment', 'training', 'pilots', 'racial', 'issues', 'are', 'presented', 'are', 'disclosed', 'only', 'manner', 'somewhat', 'tangential', 'opening', 'minutes', 'movie', 'consist', 'phony-looking', 'computer', 'graphics', 'flying', 'formations', 'Thus', 'order', 'tolerate', 'movie', 'abundant', 'quantity', 'CG-generated', 'flying', 'scenes', 'suggest', 'viewer', 'pretend', 'watching', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'movie', 'person', 'who', 'watched', 'WWII', 'movies', 'were', 'filmed', '1940s', '1950s', '1960s', 'so', 'combat', 'scenes', 'hardware', 'airplanes', 'guns', 'prison', 'camp', 'escape', 'love', 'story', 'local', 'Italian', 'woman', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'ground', 'Many', 'scenes', 'were', 'already', 'familiar', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'ESCAPE', 'part', 'RED', 'TAILS', 'was', 'copied', 'Great', 'Escape', 'TWELVE', ""O'CLOCK"", 'HIGH', 'part', 'RED', 'TAILS', 'was', 'copied', 'film', 'MAN', 'IN', 'THE', 'GRAY', 'FLANNEL', 'SUIT', 'part', 'RED', 'TAILS', 'was', 'copied', 'film', 'RED', 'TAILS', 'stories-within-a-story', 'so', 'do', 'many', 'films', 'television', 'shows', 'stories-within-a-story', 'include', 'fact', 'one', 'airmen', 'chug', 'liquor', 'flask', 'resulting', 'questions', 'ability', 'function', 'optimally', 'story-within-a-story', 'fact', 'one', 'airmen', 'love', 'Italian', 'woman', 'amusing', 'scene', 'where', 'mother', 'Italian', 'woman', 'plants', 'couple', 'first', 'date.RED', 'TAILS', 'COMPARED', 'WITH', 'THE', 'TUSKEEGEE', 'AIRMEN', 'RED', 'TAILS', 'not', 'really', 'compelling', 'film', 'three', 'reasons', 'First', 'mentioned', 'many', 'elements', 'were', 'cobbled', 'together', 'existing', 'movies', 'Second', 'computer', 'graphics', 'looked', 'phony', 'Third', 'film', 'called', 'THE', 'TUSKEEGEE', 'AIRMEN', 'far', 'superior', 'movie', 'TUSKEEGEE', 'AIRMEN', 'starring', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Andre', 'Braughner', 'leadership', 'role', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'redneck', 'congressman', 'far', 'superior', 'following', 'reasons', 'elements', 'Fishburne', 'movie', 'are', 'part', 'coherent', 'integrated', 'whole', 'example', 'episode', 'Eleanor', 'Roosevelt', 'was', 'intended', 'disclose', 'overcoming', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'episode', 'where', 'airmen', 'landed', 'country', 'road', 'America', 'was', 'intended', 'disclose', 'overcoming', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'episodes', 'Lithgow', 'were', 'intended', 'disclose', 'overcoming', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'episode', 'where', 'redneck', 'Texas', 'bombers', 'be', 'protected', 'Tuskegee', 'pilots', 'one', 'most', 'stirring', 'moments', 'history', 'American', 'cinema.In', 'contrast', 'RED', 'TAILS', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'point', 'transfer', 'money', 'public', 'company', 'located', 'former', 'Letterman', 'Hospital', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Fishburne', 'movie', 'plenty', 'soul-stirring', 'moments', 'contrast', 'RED', 'TAILS', 'merely', 'amusement', 'three', 'quarters', 'time', 'Fishburne', 'movie', 'recruitment', 'training', 'comradery', 'airmen', 'one', 'quarter', 'concerns', 'combat', 'contrast', 'primary', 'source', 'character', 'development', 'RED', 'TAILS', 'peripheral', 'story', 'Italian', 'girlfriend', 'Please', 'also', 'note', 'THE', 'TUSKEEGEE', 'AIRMEN', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'where', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'one', 'main', 'actors', 'contrast', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'extremely', 'small', 'role', 'RED', 'TAILS', 'First', 'all', 'deceptive', 'misrepresentational', 'Second', 'goal', 'motion', 'picture', 'company', 'confuse', 'public', 'thinking', 'RED', 'TAILS', 'only', 'movie', 'anyway', 'preferred', 'movie', 'Tuskeegee', 'pilots.DECEPTION', 'took', 'off', 'STAR', 'representation', 'product', 'Lucasfilms', 'deceptive', 'advertisements', 'RED', 'TAILS', 'proclaimed', 'first', 'movie', 'Tuskeegee', 'Airmen', 'false', 'movie', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'came', 'seventeen', 'years', 'earlier', 'Secondly', 'advertisements', 'RED', 'TAILS', 'proclaim', 'movie', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'incorrect', 'Mr.', 'Gooding', 'film', 'role', 'minor', 'inconsequential', 'dispensable', 'Third', 'movie', 'also', 'deceptive', 'Lucasfilms', 'attempts', 'confuse', 'public', 'including', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'movie', 'RED', 'TAILS', 'when', 'same', 'actor', 'Mr.', 'Gooding', 'had', 'played', 'major', 'role', 'earlier', 'movie', 'THE', 'TUSKEEGEE', 'AIRMEN', 'deceptive', 'goal', 'confuse', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'heard', 'original', 'film', 'thinking', 'original', 'film', 'three', 'facts', 'demonstrate', 'Lucasfilms', 'attempted', 'deceive', 'public']",N/A

That question is answered with a resounding ""yes"" by the characters portrayed in this most recent film about the first all African-American unit of fighter pilots in World War II.The film opens with three pilots encountering a suspicious train which they believed to be carrying armaments to the Axis forces. The more reckless among them, Joe ""Lightning"" Little (played by David Oyelowo) disobeys orders and attacks from the front destroying the engine and the train itself while causing not-insignificant damage to his plane. This caused great distress to the mechanic charged with repairing ""Lightning's"" plane while his disregard for the chain of command is the primary complaint of his group leader, Martin ""Easy"" Julian (played by Nate Parker). And in the background there is constant politicking from those who believe the group is a failure and a waste of resources while others like Colonel A.J. Bullard (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) are making efforts to secure more important assignments and the superior aircraft they would need to complete them.The story of The 332nd Fighter Group is an inspiring chapter in American military history. So inspiring, in fact, that it's already been told once before in the 1995 HBO film The Tuskegee Airmen. While the HBO effort was not without its problems, overall it is a superior film. True, the dog fighting scenes in Red Tails are very well-done and highly entertaining but at the time HBO was not the powerhouse it is today and if there is one thing George Lucas knows, it's aerial battles. And I was happy to see him produce something that wasn't designed to capitalize on already successful and creatively exhausted franchises. Still, this is the lesser of two films on an important subject.

I didn't know what to expect after reading the initial reviews following its theatrical release.  But then again, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls seemed to take an unfair critical drubbing, and I enjoyed that movie quite a lot (flaws and all). -- Red Tails is a war picture in the grand old tradition of war pictures.  I could easily see four clones of John Wayne starring in this movie (with a few Lee Marvins thrown in for good measure).  It is cleanly made and the two hours go by before you know it.  The aerial action is exciting and strangely reminiscent of the final space battles in both Revenge of the Sith and Attack of the Clones.  But as George Lucas financed this film himself (thank you, George) and had a hand in designing the aerial action, it is no surprise. -- Some criticism has been levelled at the film for not making more somber weight of the fact that the Tuskeegee airman were actual pilots and that they battled racism at just about every turn as they flew their way into history.  To some degree I guess I could agree with that, but the next time you watch Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra or Charlton Heston in The Ten Commandments, let me know how much is historical accuracy and how much is up on the screen for sheer entertainment.  Red Tails is, almost throughout, a thrilling movie.  The four leads are very good in their roles (I can't remember the actors' names, but they play Joker, Easy, Lightning and Ray Gun ... all good characters).  Terrance Howard is especially awesome as Colonel Bullard, the man who fights racism in Washington while the pilots fight it in Europe.  In fact, all concerned are really good in a movie that is cleanly directed by Anthony Hemingway.

The story gave a great picture of the discrimination the pilots had to overcome and also of the issues they faced individually and as a squadron.  I love stories of the underdog having to prove himself and coming out on top.  Discrimination in any form is terrible.  Overcoming it is awesome!
