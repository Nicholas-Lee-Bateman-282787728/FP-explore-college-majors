Pocker ""book reader""","[0, 1]","Whether you are a Garbo fan or interested in Germany during the 1920s, the film is a dramatization of conditions that then existed. This was Garbo's second screen performance and it's outstanding. Never seen anything else that captured the period so well. Very interesting and well worth the expense.",5,fantastic record of weimar german cinema,1213315200,"06 13, 2008",2008,300,"['are', 'Garbo', 'fan', 'interested', 'Germany', '1920s', 'film', 'dramatization', 'conditions', 'then', 'existed', 'was', 'Garbo', 'second', 'screen', 'performance', 'outstanding', 'Never', 'seen', 'anything', 'else', 'captured', 'period', 'so', 'well', 'Very', 'interesting', 'well', 'expense']",The Joyless Street VHS

The DVD case states the movie is 90 minutes, but this DVD isn't. It is 60 minutes. Even on the back of this DVD case it says 90 minutes, but it really isn't! Anyhow, all that aside, I bought this to see Greta Garbo and I wasn't disappointed. She was only 19, but already has that wonderful face and way with expressing herself and is very emotionally convincing.From what I gather, Asta Nielsen's character in the movie was edited out; thus the shorter movie. And, indeed, she is only in the beginning of the movie for a short few scenes, as is the butcher. I would like to see the whole movie, but apparently it's only available on VHS, which was too pricey for a VHS for me. And, since my main reason for buying the movie was to see Garbo, I settled for this DVD.A few of the title cards are dark during the movie, so you have to really look to read a couple of them, but they are visible. The music for the movie is Mozart, I believe. Although, I think Mozart is a little too light for this movie, at least it is pleasant. (Don't get me wrong, I love Mozart, I just think a custom score would have been a bonus.)In summary, Garbo fans will be delighted to see her in this movie.",3,Bought this to see Garbo,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,1284,"['Amazon', 'description', 'Joyless', 'Street', 'was', 'made', '1927', 'was', 'not', 'was', 'made', '1925', 'DVD', 'case', 'movie', '90', 'minutes', 'DVD', ""n't"", '60', 'minutes', 'Even', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', '90', 'minutes', 'really', ""n't"", 'Anyhow', 'aside', 'bought', 'see', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'was', 'only', '19', 'already', 'wonderful', 'face', 'way', 'expressing', 'very', 'emotionally', 'convincing.From', 'what', 'gather', 'Asta', 'Nielsen', 'character', 'movie', 'was', 'edited', 'out', 'thus', 'shorter', 'movie', 'indeed', 'only', 'beginning', 'movie', 'short', 'few', 'scenes', 'butcher', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'whole', 'movie', 'apparently', 'only', 'available', 'VHS', 'was', 'too', 'pricey', 'VHS', 'main', 'reason', 'buying', 'movie', 'was', 'see', 'Garbo', 'settled', 'DVD.A', 'few', 'title', 'cards', 'are', 'dark', 'movie', 'have', 'really', 'look', 'read', 'couple', 'are', 'visible', 'music', 'movie', 'Mozart', 'believe', 'think', 'Mozart', 'little', 'too', 'light', 'movie', 'least', 'pleasant', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'Mozart', 'just', 'think', 'custom', 'score', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bonus', 'summary', 'Garbo', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'see', 'movie']",The Joyless Street VHS

The 3-star rating is mainly for the movie itself and not the actual DVD. I'll give Synergy points for having initiative but this DVD is far from perfect. There is no interactive menu or bonus features. Once you put the DVD in you will see the usual copyright warning and then the movie just starts. Once the movie ends it will automatically restart itself so it's basically just in a continuous loop. The copy of the movie that was used here appears to be the same re-issue edition one from my old VHS copy. Also, there doesn't seem to be any signs of a restoration. Some parts are scratchy and it seems like it was directly transferred from a VHS copy. The only thing about this that's different from the VHS version is that there is a musical score. Don't expect anything on a Carl Davis level though, it's pretty much just classical music, but it's better than nothing. So, once again, it's not perfect, but if you're a Garbo fan it might be worth $9.99 to you.",3,Could have been better,1192924800,"10 21, 2007",2007,1041,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'someone', 'starting', 'release', 'more', 'Garbo', 'silents', '3-star', 'rating', 'mainly', 'movie', 'not', 'actual', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Synergy', 'points', 'having', 'initiative', 'DVD', 'far', 'perfect', 'interactive', 'menu', 'bonus', 'features', 'Once', 'put', 'DVD', 'will', 'see', 'usual', 'copyright', 'warning', 'then', 'movie', 'just', 'movie', 'will', 'automatically', 'restart', 'basically', 'just', 'continuous', 'loop', 'copy', 'movie', 'was', 'used', 'here', 'be', 'same', 're-issue', 'edition', 'one', 'old', 'VHS', 'copy', 'Also', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'signs', 'restoration', 'parts', 'are', 'scratchy', 'was', 'directly', 'transferred', 'VHS', 'copy', 'only', 'thing', 'different', 'VHS', 'version', 'musical', 'score', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'Carl', 'Davis', 'level', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'classical', 'music', 'better', 'nothing', 'So', 'once', 'again', 'not', 'perfect', ""'re"", 'Garbo', 'fan', 'might', 'be', 'worth', '9.99']",The Joyless Street VHS

Each European country edited it to suit their nationalist leanings and or censorship board demands.  Many nationalities were less than thrilled with how they were portrayed in this epic early film by G.W. Pabst from 1924.Others have written reviews so rather than duplicate their efforts, I will simply tell the viewer that this edition, Synergy Video, has a running time of 90 mins. which leads me to believe this is the French release from 1981 (albeit remastered onto DVD format).Jan-Christopher Horak has written a superlative history of this film and to him I would direct the serious film buff for further explanation about the butchery this film has been subjected to.Mr. Horak's research tells us that we may never see this film the way G.W.
