1166014,AQW40UT6OAPAZ,B001AII4QI,Joanne Patterson,"[2, 3]","I watched this box set for more than three weeks (including Season 4).  My husband could not believe that I was so ""addicted"" to this series.  Of course, with a Ph.D in Sociology and Psychology, I am very interested in what profilers do in Quantico, Virginia.  This series is very realistic and the writers of the episodes should be highly commended for the plots of each one.  Most people who share my interest will agree that he or she can relate to each episode.  There is definitely evil in this world.  Not only did I enjoy the series, I learned a lot from what I watched.

1166015,A353FSBXQOLXRC,B001AII4QI,"Johann ""Johnny B.""","[25, 28]","This perhaps is the best written, well acted, and most compelling television crime show since the advent of Kojack broke through in the late 60's and completely changed the genre of Crime Shows on the Tube.Other than Manny and Joe, none of these actors have ever had much exposure to the public at large, and yet each of them carry their weight with sincerity, glib humour, and a worldliness that literally makes you feel glad to know them.The writing on this show is some of the best I have ever seen, and the unique cinematography and special effects are not just gimics to tickle one's fancy, but rather play a crucial role in the plot of the episode.My only concern is the level of graphic violence the show exhibits from time to time, which ironically motivated Manny Patankin to quit after two successful seasons in his equal disdain for all the blood, torture, and guts.  I actually enjoy the ""suspense and mystery"" aspects of the plot lines, rather than the episodes that depict cutting someone up like in a slaughter house in the outskirts of the Chicago Butcher district.I hope the show will evolve into more of the analytical aspects of criminal profiling, and move away from this graphic stuff that is totally unneccessary for a great episode to please.Alfred Hitchcock was the master at presenting gruesome crimes without all the paint by numbers blood and guts, and as a huge fan of his career, the writers of this great TV show could take a few lessons in restraint, and be inspired by his wisdom and creativity.This is, however, a FIVE STAR PLUS DVD collection and I highly recommend it for its intelligent, suspenseful, and utterly entertaining writing and acting.",5,Is there better fare than this on TV?,1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,1681,"['perhaps', 'best', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'most', 'compelling', 'television', 'crime', 'show', 'advent', 'Kojack', 'broke', 'late', '60', 'completely', 'changed', 'genre', 'Crime', 'Shows', 'Tube.Other', 'Manny', 'Joe', 'none', 'actors', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'much', 'exposure', 'public', 'large', 'yet', 'carry', 'weight', 'sincerity', 'glib', 'humour', 'worldliness', 'literally', 'feel', 'glad', 'know', 'them.The', 'writing', 'show', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'unique', 'cinematography', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'gimics', 'tickle', 'one', 'fancy', 'rather', 'play', 'crucial', 'role', 'plot', 'episode.My', 'only', 'concern', 'level', 'graphic', 'violence', 'show', 'time', 'time', 'ironically', 'motivated', 'Manny', 'Patankin', 'quit', 'two', 'successful', 'seasons', 'equal', 'disdain', 'blood', 'torture', 'guts', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'aspects', 'plot', 'lines', 'rather', 'episodes', 'depict', 'cutting', 'someone', 'up', 'slaughter', 'house', 'outskirts', 'Chicago', 'Butcher', 'district.I', 'hope', 'show', 'will', 'evolve', 'more', 'analytical', 'aspects', 'criminal', 'profiling', 'move', 'away', 'graphic', 'stuff', 'totally', 'unneccessary', 'great', 'episode', 'please.Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'master', 'presenting', 'gruesome', 'crimes', 'paint', 'numbers', 'blood', 'guts', 'huge', 'fan', 'career', 'writers', 'great', 'TV', 'show', 'could', 'take', 'few', 'lessons', 'restraint', 'be', 'inspired', 'wisdom', 'creativity.This', 'however', 'FIVE', 'STAR', 'PLUS', 'DVD', 'collection', 'highly', 'recommend', 'intelligent', 'suspenseful', 'utterly', 'entertaining', 'writing', 'acting']",Criminal Minds - Seasons 1-3

On the basis of psyco killers alone, Criminal Minds has to be the most well written show on television, with every new episode, there's a new killer with his own idiosyncrasies that is uniquely different than the one before it. The cast of Criminal Minds is largely a group of relative unknowns, minus Joe Mantegna and Shemar Moore of Soul Train these days. Still every member of the cast plays their role perfectly from the forensic analyst to the criminal pathologist.
