782039,AA1BKO3XQ1N8V,B0000JBUHI,"Andrew ""Ciao""","[25, 27]","Blue Hill Avenue is the story of 4 friends growing up in Roxbury (Boston).  They start with peddling marijuana in high school, and end up as hard core crack dealers. Tristan (played by Allen Payne) is the star of the movie and the leader of the gang.Throughout the movie, Tristan's family confronts him his dealing.  During a particularly painful family incident, Tristan's father approaches Tristan and asks how could he end up a dealer when he came from such a good famliy. Tristan is at a loss for an explanation, and responds to his dad, &quot;Because I'm good at it&quot;.The film includes lots of action, perhaps a bit more violence than was really necessary for the story line.  Blue Hill Avenue dares to show how a young man from a decent upbringing can get caught up in the wrong crowd, and how it impacts an otherwise decent family.  Towards the end of the movie, Tristan acknowledges that his friends will be the end of him.Blue Hill Avenue was actually filmed in Canada, in Saint John, New Brunswick.

782059,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B0000JBUHI,Thomas M. Sipos,"[1, 2]","Director Craig Ross seems inspired by Martin Scorsese.  As in GOODFELLAS and CASINO, Ross's BLUEHILL AVENUE charts the rise and fall of gansters.  Ross also uses similar filmic techniques.  He introduces many peripheral characters, panning over them as they work in their growing drug trade; a voice-over explains in detail each person's role in the crime operation.  And it's a long film, epic length at 127 minutes.BLUEHILL AVENUE is low budget, and it shows.  The art direction and special effects aren't as ""big"" as in CASINO.  Yet despite its smallness, BLUEHILL AVENUE isn't shabby.  The acting is first rate.  The writing is sharp.  The cinematography is moody and textured.  This is no direct-to-video cheapie with bad acting and flat lighting.The film lost me in some places, mostly where it seemed torn between a gritty realism and hyper-stylized violence.  For instance, much of the film opts for the gritty realism of a Scorsese film.  But then there's a shootout, and BLUEHILL AVENUE forgets its realism, opting instead for a hyper-stylized battle where the outnumbered ""good guys"" are ambushed and outgunned, yet still manage to kill all the baddies, without suffering even a flesh wound.That sort of fantasy shootout may work for Shaft or James Bond, but it undermines the realism that BLUEHILL AVENUE had set up.This is a guy's film.  Despite her prominent billing, Angelle Brooks's role is minor.  Mostly she worries about her hubby, and nags him to quick the gang.BLUEHILL AVENUE is not a great film, and certainly not original.  At times its sharp dialog verges on the cliche.  Yet it's a well made film, polished and entertaining.",3,"A low-budget, black GOODFELLAS.
