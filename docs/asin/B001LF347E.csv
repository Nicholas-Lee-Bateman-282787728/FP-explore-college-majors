1214083,ARNAOSKQZMM2J,B001LF347E,Amanda,"[3, 3]","Much in the vein of the currently-popular franchise ""re-boot"" idea, Merlin: The Complete First Season continues this idea by re-inventing the traditional Arthurian legends for a newer, younger audience. In this BBC production, the typical, white-haired ""old man"" version of Merlin is traded in for a young boy learning about his magic and his destiny.Merlin (Colin Morgan) is a naturally gifted warlock who is sent to live with Gaius (Richard Wilson), the physician in the court of Uther Pendragon (Anthony Head), king of Camelot. However, Uther has become a tyrant and prosecutes anyone and anything associate with magic. Uther's only small joy rests in his son, the famous Arthur (Bradley James) who, in this show, is depicted as an arrogant and reckless, yet well-meaning youth that always manages to get into trouble (and Merlin has to save him) . After saving Arthur's life, Merlin becomes his personal manservant, and thus begins Merlin's journey to realize his destiny as a powerful warlock and protector and friend to Arthur. Merlin and Arthur are joined in their journey by Morgana (Katie McGrath), the king's ward, and her maidservant Guinevere ""Gwen"" (Angel Coulby).The plotlines for about the first half of the series seem to blur together. Each episode feels like a repeat of the last, following the same formula: a stranger shows up claiming to be someone they are not, Merlin uncovers the true and wants to use magic to fix it, when Merlin confronts others about the truth no one believes him, Merlin eventually saves the day with magic secretly, and Arthur typically gets the credit. The characters also felt very flat in these episodes, with little development and little relationship growth. The only thing that got me through these episodes were the high production values (the BBC doesn't skimp) and the fun, adventure aspect of the show.Thankfully, the second half of the season really picks up. Plotlines grow more complex, characters grow deeper and the show takes a darker turn that drew me in. It becomes apparent that the first half of the season was meant to be exposition, and the writers finally got to a point where they could grow legs under their show. In particular, Morgana takes unexpected turns that pulls viewers in and makes them question everything they've learned about the world of Merlin.The oddest thing about the American distribution of Merlin is the fact that it aired on NBC on Sunday nights. Sure, it was picked up during the summer, likely to be a filler show during the off months, but I thought it an odd choice and an odd time slot, but figured that NBC was hoping that Merlin could pull some of the Doctor Who fans and possible enjoy cult status -plus it's family-friendly. Unfortunately, NBC didn't pick up season two, but SyFy did, and is currently airing it. A third season is currently in the works from the BBC.Bonus features in this five-disc set include episode commentary, two in-depth making of featurettes, video diaries from some of the cast while filming the series, photo galleries and wallpapers. While I found that this was a worthwhile collection of extras, I was hoping for something a little more -like deleted scenes from certain episodes, or an exploration of the original Aruthurian legends and how they are different/similar to the series.Merlin is offered in complete surround-sound stereo, which really comes in handy during the action sequences. Surprisingly though, only English subtitles and English language audio track is available, which will probably disappoint fans with alternative language preferences.While the show does have some shortfalls, it's a fun adventure that'll keep audiences of all ages entertained. The second half of the season proves that Merlin is filled with potential to grow into a powerful show filled with magic, depth and amazingly complex character.",4,Slow start that develops into something complex and compelling,1273017600,"05 5, 2010",2010,3860,"['Much', 'vein', 'currently-popular', 'franchise', 're-boot', 'idea', 'Merlin', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'idea', 're-inventing', 'traditional', 'Arthurian', 'legends', 'newer', 'younger', 'audience', 'BBC', 'production', 'typical', 'white-haired', 'old', 'man', 'version', 'Merlin', 'traded', 'young', 'boy', 'learning', 'magic', 'destiny.Merlin', 'Colin', 'Morgan', 'naturally', 'gifted', 'warlock', 'who', 'sent', 'live', 'Gaius', 'Richard', 'Wilson', 'physician', 'court', 'Uther', 'Pendragon', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'king', 'Camelot', 'However', 'Uther', 'become', 'tyrant', 'anyone', 'anything', 'associate', 'magic', 'only', 'small', 'joy', 'rests', 'son', 'famous', 'Arthur', 'Bradley', 'James', 'who', 'show', 'depicted', 'arrogant', 'reckless', 'yet', 'well-meaning', 'youth', 'always', 'get', 'trouble', 'Merlin', 'save', 'saving', 'Arthur', 'life', 'Merlin', 'personal', 'manservant', 'thus', 'Merlin', 'journey', 'realize', 'destiny', 'powerful', 'warlock', 'protector', 'friend', 'Arthur', 'Merlin', 'Arthur', 'are', 'joined', 'journey', 'Morgana', 'Katie', 'McGrath', 'king', 'ward', 'maidservant', 'Guinevere', 'Gwen', 'Angel', 'Coulby', '.The', 'plotlines', 'first', 'half', 'series', 'seem', 'blur', 'together', 'episode', 'feels', 'repeat', 'last', 'following', 'same', 'formula', 'stranger', 'up', 'claiming', 'be', 'someone', 'are', 'not', 'Merlin', 'true', 'use', 'magic', 'fix', 'when', 'Merlin', 'others', 'truth', 'one', 'Merlin', 'eventually', 'day', 'magic', 'secretly', 'Arthur', 'typically', 'credit', 'characters', 'also', 'felt', 'very', 'flat', 'episodes', 'little', 'development', 'little', 'relationship', 'growth', 'only', 'thing', 'got', 'episodes', 'were', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'BBC', ""n't"", 'skimp', 'fun', 'adventure', 'aspect', 'show.Thankfully', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'really', 'up', 'Plotlines', 'grow', 'more', 'complex', 'characters', 'grow', 'deeper', 'show', 'darker', 'turn', 'drew', 'apparent', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'exposition', 'writers', 'finally', 'got', 'point', 'where', 'could', 'grow', 'legs', 'show', 'particular', 'Morgana', 'unexpected', 'turns', 'viewers', 'question', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'world', 'Merlin.The', 'oddest', 'thing', 'American', 'distribution', 'Merlin', 'fact', 'aired', 'NBC', 'Sunday', 'nights', 'Sure', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'summer', 'likely', 'be', 'filler', 'show', 'off', 'months', 'thought', 'odd', 'choice', 'odd', 'time', 'slot', 'figured', 'NBC', 'was', 'hoping', 'Merlin', 'could', 'pull', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fans', 'possible', 'enjoy', 'cult', 'status', 'family-friendly', 'Unfortunately', 'NBC', 'did', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'season', 'two', 'SyFy', 'did', 'currently', 'airing', 'third', 'season', 'currently', 'works', 'BBC.Bonus', 'features', 'five-disc', 'set', 'include', 'episode', 'commentary', 'two', 'in-depth', 'making', 'featurettes', 'video', 'diaries', 'cast', 'filming', 'series', 'photo', 'galleries', 'wallpapers', 'found', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'collection', 'extras', 'was', 'hoping', 'something', 'little', 'more', '-like', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'certain', 'episodes', 'exploration', 'original', 'Aruthurian', 'legends', 'how', 'are', 'different/similar', 'series.Merlin', 'offered', 'complete', 'surround-sound', 'stereo', 'really', 'handy', 'action', 'sequences', 'Surprisingly', 'only', 'English', 'subtitles', 'English', 'language', 'audio', 'track', 'available', 'will', 'probably', 'disappoint', 'fans', 'alternative', 'language', 'show', 'have', 'shortfalls', 'fun', 'adventure', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'audiences', 'ages', 'entertained', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'Merlin', 'filled', 'potential', 'grow', 'powerful', 'show', 'filled', 'magic', 'depth', 'amazingly', 'complex', 'character']",Merlin: Season 1
1214084,A85GHQYRQMC4T,B001LF347E,"Amazon Customer ""book junkie""","[4, 4]","I am really enjoying this series so far.  I was a little heartbroken when the BBC cancelled Robin Hood, which was great (five stars in my opinion) but am glad they have another period show on again.  Maybe at some point the USA will catch on and start making some tv shows that revolve around friendship, history/legend, and moral chivalry instead of sex and skinny, cranky girls...just saying.  Anyhow, it is about Merlin, a young magician and Prince Arthur, heir to Camelot.  You also get to meet Gwen, a ""serving girl"" of sorts, and Morgana, ward of King Uther, and Gaius, physician to the throne.  There is also a dragon that becomes Merlin's advisor sort of.  The relationships between characters in this show is what makes it endearing.  Gaius is looking after Merlin for his mother because magic and socery has been outlawed.  Merlin can't seem to not use it, but keeps it quiet.  However it seems Morgana also has the ""sight"" unbeknown to Merlin.  And the adventure begins!  For example: they save a young druid boy, fight a wraith, and find out what is magically poisoning the water supply of Camelot.  This show is light hearted and family oriented!

Yes it's cheesy, yes some of the special effects are...well..bad, yes it is completely ""historically"" inaccurate.

1214086,A1FE06N5A77K8W,B001LF347E,Annie Feng,"[10, 22]","Merlin is a modernized version of the Arthurian legend. By modernized I mean they changed the characters dramatically from the old legend so that we, the people of the 21st century, can relate to and sympathize with. This show is definitely not for Arthurian purists, but it's an addictive fun watch for those of us who like to suck up to fantasy tales with handsome gallant princes and magical beasts.Merlin the protagonist became the dorky dweeb with a kind and responsible heart instead of the all-wise, all-knowing old gray wizard we knew about. He's the your-average-geek with elvish ears, high cheekbones and mystical blue eyes. Prince Arthur is the typical kind of school bully, who also looks very much like a high school jock (although obviously much older), with record-setting sexist blond hair of any Arthur in any on-screen I've ever seen (and believe me I've seen quite a lot). Morgana is the fashionista with attitude, or, in modern terms, the perfect feminist; she's beautiful, she's a fighter, and she's not afraid to speak her mind and constantly go against daddy tyranny (what girl wouldn't look up to her?) and finally Guinevere is the down-to-earth schoolgirl who also can stand up for herself. Lancelot is the down-to-earth sweet guy that'd be your kind of perfect date.So basically, the addiction comes from the fact that we see these kinds of people every day. It's almost the Merlin version of Shrek, slightly less cheesy. But the good news is that these actors all know what they're doing. The cast is composed of mostly brand-newcomers but they are indeed very talented, especially Colin Morgan (who plays Merlin), and Bradley James (who plays Arthur), both of them thankfully have most of the screen-time. As the show moves on we discover that Merlin isn't as geeky as he looks, and Arthur can very much be princely when it matters. Those two steals the show, and their chemistry--some call it gay some call it bromance--however you interpret it, is torching.The older cast is not bad either. Dear Giles from Buffy turns into his dark side. But you can't quite state whether he is good or evil. Mostly what you can say is he's ""wavering"" like any sort of politician with massive power. Gaius became the mentor of the show, not only mentoring Merlin but Uther also. Well, you always need a good mentor to get the show going, I guess.The show is with many plot holes, something they need to work on for future seasons. but season two is definitely better in terms of character development--their strongest quality with this showSo with all that's said, I'm going to start the ""rant""--the one thing that I think the show can do without:The cast choice of GwenThe problem:I'm sorry to say this but Angel Coulby is really a miscast. Casting her as the future queen of England is wrong on so many levels that it's distracting to say the least. Many have complained that the actress is, let's face it, simply not attractive to match for the magazine model Arthur. Some people have tried to defend her by accusing perfectionist--that it's good that they casted people without perfect looks. Puh-leaze, why then make Arthur a hottie? Other people say she is pretty you're just used to European beauty. Even if that's true (believe me it's not, she wouldn't have been any prettier if she were white), it's still such a pain to have to hypnotize myself into denial of her (un)beauty.But I do have to say that this is not the main problem I have with her. My problem is the fact that the maker of the show is trying to do the overkill Cinderella story (which in my opinion is not only a naive way of looking at relatinships, but believe me it never works) WITH race. They casted a whitest white guy you could find, with blond hair blue eyes, and attempt to match her with a black girl. The whole message is literally screaming out: ""hey look! WE ARE NOT RACIST! and oh, if you even dare say anything bad about the cast choice, you are just a racist!"" This REALLY isn't necessary, every time I look at Gwen the first thought that popped into my head is not her unattractiveness, but ""HEY THERE WEREN'T ANY BLACK PEOPLE IN MEDIEVAL GREAT BRITAIN!!!"" Making Guinevere a black girl is as ridiculous as making her Asian, or Native American, or Indian. What's worse is that, if the writers follow the original Arthur tale with Arthur and Guinevere and Lancelot, which they do seem to, Guinevere will eventually betray Arthur after their marriage. Then the whole racism issue simply backfires.I have mentioned above regarding disdain of the Cinderella story that the writers chose with Arthur and Gwen and that it's a naive look of relationship (as many re-tellings of the Cinderella story have pointed out). Why? because realistically speaking, relationships last longer when the two people have more things in common than the commonly misguided and false stereotype: ""the opposite attracts."" Because youth/beauty, passion, and romance will eventually die out, and what's left is partnership. If the husband and the wife can help each other out in career and in family life, the relationship tends to last longer. Which is why people from different social classes rarely will get along, especially not back then when the gap is so huge--Princess Diana ring any bell? And surprise the blackness of Gwen landed her a maid. In fact, I predicted that this is what the writers are going to use for an explanation of the break-up between Gwen and Arthur, and we are all suppose to sympathize with them-that when they are married the reason why Gwen ran away with Lancelot is because Arthur had to always put country first and she would feel out of place. Which can only make it even more cliched and unbearable. In fact, this is the reason why the romance between Arthur and Gwen is such a forward leap and unconvincing to say the least, as many have already pointed out. Do they really have ANY common language or chemistry? I think not.Yes yes I know it's just a show and not historic documentary, it's still not an excuse, and I still have my freedom of expression, so deal with it.Overall it's an enjoyable show, and if what I pointed out above is not something that bothers you, all the better.",4,"while many flaws, addictive and a breath of fresh air",1273449600,"05 10, 2010",2010,6203,"['Merlin', 'modernized',

1214097,AB34G6VKP28L,B001LF347E,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[9, 10]","British television series can be hit or miss with American audiences but some of them become immensely popular and a decision was made to test out programming on the general public on a non-cable network to see if the latest family fare from England would stick. Merlin takes all the legends of the knights of the round table and turns them on their head but for the most part is solid entertainment and certainly better than some of the alternatives. It's also less campy than its precursor, Robin Hood.Magic has been outlawed in the kingdom of Camelot due to ""grave offenses"" by wizards and warlocks and so anyone with extraordinary gifts must remain hidden for fear of persecution and death. Young sorcerer Merlin (Colin Morgan) has come to Camelot at the insistence of his mother, who believes he will have a better life outside their impoverished village, but has difficulty not revealing his telekinetic abilities when faced with the bullies of the city, among them the arrogant Prince Arthur (Bradley James). Immediately getting off on the wrong foot with the heir to the throne does him no favors when the king's physician (and a former user of magic) Gaius (Richard Wilson) agrees to mentor him in the hope of further training his abilities. But his unique talent might be revealed when a resentful sorceress visits Camelot intending to have revenge for her mother's death.While learning much from the old dragon that imprisoned beneath the castle until the ""old ways"" are reinstated, Merlin hones his skills, attempts to be a good valet to the noble Arthur, and is of interest to the two women in his life -- the hard-working servant girl Guinevere (Angel Coulby) and her mistress, the secretive and beautiful Morgana (McGrath). Woven throughout the first season are encounters with other characters that will become important in Arthur lore -- including a visit from a young peasant who wishes to become a knight (Lancelot), and a child with abnormal magical abilities (Mordred). I was not too impressed with the first couple of episodes. I didn't like their casting decisions all that much and thought Arthur was depicted as too much of a jerk, but after awhile he calmed down and made leaps toward becoming the noble majesty we know so well from various films and legends.The cast are all very good but I do question their judgment in certain areas. The actress playing Gwen is likable enough but she doesn't seem to live up to the reputation Guinevere has of being the most beautiful woman in the kingdom... not to mention the fact that she is a servant. I'm not sure I like how much the legends have been changed to modernize and rejuvenate the material but on the flip side, Morgana is a stroke of brilliance. She is much under-used in the first half of the season but really comes into her own as the series continues and by the end is one of the most interesting characters. The costuming is not accurate but is so gorgeous and unique in kind of a ""punk medieval"" style that I don't mind. Certain of Morgana's gowns in particular are exquisite. My only real complaint is that the CGI leaves much to be desired and shows a limited budget, but since it is infrequent that fault can be overlooked.It might not be everyone's cup of tea and is aimed at a younger age group, but the writing is decent enough and the cast good enough that it is easy to sit back and enjoy it as something you will not have to fast-forward your way through. If you can stomach some changes to the legend in favor of a new approach, I think you will enjoy Merlin.",3,wonderful for the junior set,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,3555,"['British', 'television', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'hit', 'miss', 'American', 'audiences', 'become', 'immensely', 'popular', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'test', 'out', 'programming', 'general', 'public', 'non-cable', 'network', 'see', 'latest', 'family', 'fare', 'England', 'would', 'stick', 'Merlin', 'legends', 'knights', 'round', 'table', 'head', 'most', 'part', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'certainly', 'better', 'alternatives', 'also', 'less', 'campy', 'precursor', 'Robin', 'Hood.Magic', 'been', 'outlawed', 'kingdom', 'Camelot', 'due', 'grave', 'offenses', 'wizards', 'warlocks', 'so', 'anyone', 'extraordinary', 'gifts', 'must', 'remain', 'hidden', 'fear', 'persecution', 'death', 'Young', 'sorcerer', 'Merlin', 'Colin', 'Morgan', 'come', 'Camelot', 'insistence', 'mother', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'better', 'life', 'impoverished', 'village', 'difficulty', 'not', 'revealing', 'telekinetic', 'abilities', 'when', 'faced', 'bullies', 'city', 'arrogant', 'Prince', 'Arthur', 'Bradley', 'James', 'Immediately', 'getting', 'off', 'wrong', 'foot', 'heir', 'throne', 'favors', 'when', 'king', 'physician', 'former', 'user', 'magic', 'Gaius', 'Richard', 'Wilson', 'mentor', 'hope', 'further', 'training', 'abilities', 'unique', 'talent', 'might', 'be', 'revealed', 'when', 'resentful', 'sorceress', 'visits', 'Camelot', 'intending', 'have', 'revenge', 'mother', 'death.While', 'learning', 'much', 'old', 'dragon', 'imprisoned', 'castle', 'old', 'ways', 'are', 'reinstated', 'Merlin', 'skills', 'attempts', 'be', 'good', 'valet', 'noble', 'Arthur', 'interest', 'two', 'women', 'life', 'hard-working', 'servant', 'girl', 'Guinevere', 'Angel', 'Coulby', 'mistress', 'secretive', 'beautiful', 'Morgana', 'McGrath', 'Woven', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'encounters', 'other', 'characters', 'will', 'become', 'important', 'Arthur', 'lore', 'including', 'visit', 'young', 'peasant', 'who', 'become', 'knight', 'Lancelot', 'child', 'abnormal', 'magical', 'abilities', 'Mordred', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'impressed', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'casting', 'decisions', 'that', 'much', 'thought', 'Arthur', 'was', 'depicted', 'too', 'much', 'jerk', 'calmed', 'down', 'made', 'leaps', 'becoming', 'noble', 'majesty', 'know', 'so', 'well', 'various', 'films', 'legends.The', 'cast', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'do', 'question', 'judgment', 'certain', 'areas', 'actress', 'playing', 'Gwen', 'likable', 'enough', ""n't"", 'seem', 'live', 'up', 'reputation', 'Guinevere', 'being', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'kingdom', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'servant', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'like', 'how', 'much', 'legends', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'modernize', 'rejuvenate', 'material', 'flip', 'side', 'Morgana', 'stroke', 'brilliance', 'much', 'under-used', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'really', 'own', 'series', 'end', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'costuming', 'not', 'accurate', 'so', 'gorgeous', 'unique', 'kind', 'punk', 'medieval', 'style', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Certain', 'Morgana', 'gowns', 'particular', 'are', 'exquisite', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'CGI', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'limited', 'budget', 'infrequent', 'fault', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked.It', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'aimed', 'younger', 'age', 'group', 'writing', 'decent', 'enough', 'cast', 'good', 'enough', 'easy', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'something', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'fast-forward', 'way', 'can', 'stomach', 'changes', 'legend', 'favor', 'new', 'approach', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Merlin']",Merlin: Season 1

1214103,A2GQJ2VNYLYSLF,B001LF347E,"Daniel ""smart books hunter""","[285, 289]","I absolutely enjoyed this show. The first episode hit on that the relationship between Merlin, the young magician, and Arthur, the prince of Camelot is essential and very important. As they meet, they both sort of hate each other, but destiny brings them together, like two sides of one coin for a reason. The first episode also made it clear that Magic is forbidden in this land, so it is intriguing to see how everything would turn out. If you give this show a chance, you will be surprised by twists and turns of the events. Unexpected story, like suspense, that's what come to my mind. Everything in the story is important as things will come together and make more sense.The things I like the best are:1. Great setting. The castle in this TV show is real and it's astonishing! It is one of the best castles in France. Some scenes also take place in Wales and the woods are so magical. I donno how they do it, but the whole setting, the nature, the castles are very mystical, fantastic and beautiful!2. New actors. I hate big name actors. When I watch someone act, I don't want to think about the actor, I want to focus on the character, and that's what you get in this TV Show. The acting is brilliant. It is never overacted, so to keep you focused on the story. Because episodes tell the story in a fast paced manner, as there is so much to tell, the actors keep things smooth, clear and real. There are no awkward situations and the production is made to make you feel like you're there. I found myself worrying when the actors worried, even though I knew things would turn out fine. So the emotions are definitely pass on to the viewers from the skilled actors.3. Characters and the friendship plot. The friendship is as complicating as it is deep and also very good. We learn about the relations of Merlin and Arthur that there is love, there are difficulties, mysteries, secrets, but we also learn about friendships among the rest of the many characters in this story. They are all interconnected and deepen as the story progresses. I don't want to spoil anything, so I wont tell you who is friend and who is a foe. One thing I will mention is that every character has demons as they also have angels in them. Things may turn out for or against their relationships towards each other, you just never know how. That's what kept me watching this show. No one is too perfect or too evil. Everyone has flaws here, and they all react to them differently.  So the show is very focused on the development of characters while keeping the whole thing fast paced and action packed. I am amazed at their abilities to do that. There must be real good writers at this show. Each character has a whole lot to reveal through their past, present and even the future. I was surprised over and over by what I could learn about certain characters with each episode.4. The magic. The magic in this story is essential, but we also know that it is forbidden in Camelot. At first I didn't like the idea as I was too afraid that we wont see much magic happen. I was wrong. There is plenty of magic in this show. It all comes from unexpected chain of events. Also, magic is not all great. There are many who want to use it for evil, so perhaps there is a reason it is forbidden in Camelot.....5. Special effects. Some say the dragon in this show looks bad. I agree that it could have looked more realistic, but it is not horrible at all. In fact, it looks realistic to me. I mean, it doesn't look like an animal on geographic channel, but it does look like a mystical creature we've never really seen in life. It looks like it is done on the computer, but not to the extent that it is too obvious. You can still enjoy the dragon if you are not holding a magnifying glass in your hand trying to study its scales. The rest of the creatures and magical special effects in my opinion are great. They are just about the same as in Harry Potter movies.6. Message on morality. Over and over I catch myself noticing good moral lessons in this show. For young people to watch this show, is not only to enjoy the story and catchy special effects, but also to learn lessons between choosing what is right in one's life. Characters are constantly tested and at crossroads. Each decision we make matters a lot for our own future and the people we love. Morals on friendships, respect, patience, good will, forgiveness. I still remember the episode called ""to kill the king"". It was the most amazing lesson on forgiveness I've ever seen done on TV.Right now the show ended with the 13th episode, the last one of the first season and I can tell you, it is at its climax. The show has climbed up high in just 13 episodes. We now have more answers. We know the characters to heart, but we are also puzzled with new information given about them, as nothing is too certain and there are hidden skeletons on the closets. So that only makes things even more exciting. We also went through the pain, struggles, losses as well as joy, great friendships and miracles with these characters.As far as some complaints you may face about this show... I've heard people expressing lots of hateful messages, like the show looks cheap, actors are horrible, etc, etc... I don't know if those people are blind, or if they even saw any of ""Merlin"", or are they just negative trolls who know nothing but spread negativity online. Some say that the show is not as true to the original legend. But If you don't like this interpretation of the legend, there are millions of other interpretations out there, and NO ONE really knows which one is the right one. I googles the legends of king Arthur and Merlin for weeks now and have found that no one really knows what happened. No one knows who was who's son, wife, friend, foe... No one knows who killed who and so forth... There are tales and songs from everywhere saying different things. Apart from that, people also complain about the acting, and the special effects. As I am a theater actor myself, I gotta say the actors are amazing. I have yet to see anyone in this show underact or overact. And the dragon effects don't bother me a bit, as I am too focused on paying attention to what's going on. BBC cannot put more money into this as they already have. As much as they put into this show, they did an amazing job. They keep the writing entertaining, deep and mysterious, and they keep the directing smooth, fast paces and beautiful. I have only one complaint, I want to see more!!!!!So in the end of my review, I just hope that I was able to convince some of you to watch this show, and excite you somewhat as deep as I am excited about it. I hope I helped you lose some of you concerns and questions answered. Enjoy this TV serious with a simplistic heart and it will take you on a great journey!

Merlin has magical powers and arrives at the city of Camelot, after his mother arranges for him to become an apprentice of Gaius. He discovers that the king, Uther Pendragon, has outlawed magic and has imprisoned the last dragon deep under the city. The dragon informs him that he Merlin has an important destiny to protect Uther's son, Arthur, who will bring forth a great Kingdom. When he meets Arthur for the first time he discovers that he is arrogant and a bully, but after he saves Arthur's life, he is reworded with a job in the Royal Household as Arthur's manservant, and they become close friends. Arthur is unaware of Merlin's magical ability, as Merlin has to keep it a secret or face execution at the hands of Uther. Morgana is Uther's ward with the power of prophetic foresight, which frightens her and which she keeps secret. Gwen is her maid servant and close friend. The first series focused on the development of Merlin and his friendship with Arthur. The second series focuses more on development of the other cast members. Some of the central themes of the series are the budding romance between Arthur and Gwen and Morgana's struggle to control her powers. Other characters from Arthurian legend have appeared. Lancelot longed to become a knight, but unable to do so because of his birth as a commoner. Mordred has appeared as a Druid boy who formed a bond with Morgana ( In some legends he is Morgause's son) and it has been predicted by the dragon that Mordred will be the cause of death of Arthur (In legend this occurred at the Battle of Camlann) Mordred and the Great Dragon refer to Merlin by his Druidic name, Emrys (the Welsh form of Ambrosius); Abrosius Aurelianus was a historical figure whom Geoffrey of Monmouth partially merged with Merlin, Excalibur is an ordinary sword that becomes enchanted by the Great Dragon.Cast are, (Merlin, ""Collin Morgan"") (Arthur, ""Bradley James"") (King Uther, ""Anthony Head"") (Morgana, ""Katie McGrath"") ( Gwen, ""Angel Coulby"") (Gaius,""Richard Wilson"") ( The Great Dragon, ""Voiced by John Hurt"") This series aired in 2008 in the UK and 2009 in the US season 3 is being filmed in England and in France.",5,"On TV or DVD, Great Seasons, The Adventures of Merlin.",1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,2285,"['one', 'best', 'tv', 'shows', 'place', 'when', 'Merlin', 'Arthur', 'Pendragon', 'were', 'young', 'men', 'Camelot.Plot..', 'Merlin', 'magical', 'powers', 'arrives', 'city', 'Camelot', 'mother', 'arranges', 'become', 'apprentice', 'Gaius', 'king', 'Uther', 'Pendragon', 'outlawed', 'magic', 'imprisoned', 'last', 'dragon', 'deep', 'city', 'dragon', 'Merlin', 'important', 'destiny', 'protect', 'Uther', 'son', 'Arthur', 'who', 'will', 'bring', 'forth', 'great', 'Kingdom', 'When', 'Arthur', 'first', 'time', 'arrogant', 'bully', 'Arthur', 'life', 'reworded', 'job', 'Royal', 'Household', 'Arthur', 'manservant', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'Arthur', 'unaware', 'Merlin', 'magical', 'ability', 'Merlin', 'keep', 'secret', 'face', 'execution', 'hands', 'Uther', 'Morgana', 'Uther', 'ward', 'power', 'prophetic', 'foresight', 'secret', 'Gwen', 'maid', 'servant', 'close', 'friend', 'first', 'series', 'focused', 'development', 'Merlin', 'friendship', 'Arthur', 'second', 'series', 'more', 'development', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'central', 'themes', 'series', 'are', 'budding', 'romance', 'Arthur', 'Gwen', 'Morgana', 'struggle', 'control', 'powers', 'Other', 'characters', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'have', 'appeared', 'Lancelot', 'longed', 'become', 'knight', 'unable', 'do', 'so', 'birth', 'commoner', 'Mordred', 'appeared', 'Druid', 'boy', 'who', 'formed', 'bond', 'Morgana', 'legends', 'Morgause', 'son', 'been', 'predicted', 'dragon', 'Mordred', 'will', 'be', 'cause', 'death', 'Arthur', 'legend', 'occurred', 'Battle', 'Camlann', 'Mordred', 'Great', 'Dragon', 'refer', 'Merlin', 'Druidic', 'name', 'Emrys', 'Welsh', 'form', 'Ambrosius', 'Abrosius', 'Aurelianus', 'was', 'historical', 'figure', 'whom', 'Geoffrey', 'Monmouth', 'partially', 'merged', 'Merlin', 'Excalibur', 'ordinary', 'sword', 'enchanted', 'Great', 'Dragon.Cast', 'are', 'Merlin', 'Collin', 'Morgan', 'Arthur', 'Bradley', 'James', 'King', 'Uther', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'Morgana', 'Katie', 'McGrath', 'Gwen', 'Angel', 'Coulby', 'Gaius', 'Richard', 'Wilson', 'Great', 'Dragon', 'Voiced', 'John', 'Hurt', 'series', 'aired', '2008', 'UK', '2009', 'US', 'season', '3', 'being', 'filmed', 'England', 'France']",Merlin: Season 1

1214110,A1EXBK6NNHJ4PW,B001LF347E,Emma Richards,"[1, 1]","It's funny how you change your mind about things. I remember seeing the previews for this BBC import when it began airing on NBC and later SciFi Channel, but honestly thought it looked... well, kind of bad. Then, this summer I got hooked on another Medieval Fantasy show, Legend of the Seeker, and noticed many LOTS fans also seemed to be fans of Merlin. ""Well,"" I thought to myself, ""if this show's so popular among LOTS fans, it can't be all bad."" So I decided to check it out, and man, am I glad I did!The first few episodes are... well, they're not very good, but they were enough to keep me watching, and by the middle of the season the show had drastically improved. The last seven episodes (there are 13 total) definitely make up for the shaky first half.As others have pointed out, the special effects are not the best, to put it kindly (come on, this is a BBC show, what did you expect?), but really, the SFX are actually not that important. This show is all about the characters, and the choices that those characters make. The ""magic"" is really an afterthought. And the characters are all well-written and well-played, my favorite being the jerk with a heart o' gold Prince Arthur, who goes through some of the best written character development I've ever seen, from spoiled brat at the beginning of the show to a kind-hearted, though still rather thoughtless, young man. You can really see what he'll be like as the Once and Future King.Though Arthur's my favorite, I'd have to say that Colin Morgan puts in the best performance as the title character. Richard Wilson is fine as Gaius, nothing revelatory about his performance, just good. Anthony Head does a great job of making Uther the character you love to hate, and is obviously having a ball. Angel Coulby as Guinevere really grows as an actress over the show, as does Gwen as a character. Indeed, now that the first three seasons have aired, I would say that Colin and Angel are the show's strongest actors. Katie McGrath rounds out the main cast as the infamous sorceress Morgana, and though Katie is a fine actress and I love her character, I would have to say that she is the weakest actor of the main cast. She does improve over the course of the show, however.All in all, unlikely as I thought it would be, Merlin has not only become my favorite adaptation of Arthurian legend, of all the books and movies and TV productions based on it, it is currently one of the best shows on TV. And the best thing is, it improves with every season. Season two was miles better than season one, so much so that I would almost encourage potential viewers to start with season two if I didn't find the idea of watching a show out of order so abhorrent. And season three is the best yet by far!I was overjoyed to hear that it was renewed for a fourth season, and I can only hope that it continues the pattern of each season being better than the last. Also, here's hoping we do get that fifth and final season!",4,My Favorite Arthurian Adaptation,1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,2968,"['funny', 'how', 'change', 'mind', 'things', 'remember', 'seeing', 'previews', 'BBC', 'import', 'when', 'began', 'airing', 'NBC', 'later', 'SciFi', 'Channel', 'honestly', 'thought', 'looked', 'well', 'kind', 'bad', 'Then', 'summer', 'got', 'hooked', 'Medieval', 'Fantasy', 'show', 'Legend', 'Seeker', 'noticed', 'many', 'LOTS', 'fans', 'also', 'seemed', 'be', 'fans', 'Merlin', 'Well', 'thought', 'myself', 'show', 'so', 'popular', 'LOTS', 'fans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'man', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'well', ""'re"", 'not', 'very', 'good', 'were', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'middle', 'season', 'show', 'had', 'drastically', 'improved', 'last', 'seven', 'episodes', 'are', '13', 'total', 'definitely', 'make', 'up', 'shaky', 'first', 'half.As', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'best', 'put', 'kindly', 'come', 'BBC', 'show', 'what', 'did', 'expect', 'really', 'SFX', 'are', 'actually', 'not', 'important', 'show', 'characters', 'choices', 'characters', 'make', 'magic', 'really', 'afterthought', 'characters', 'are', 'well-written', 'well-played', 'favorite', 'being', 'jerk', 'heart', 'o', 'gold', 'Prince', 'Arthur', 'who', 'best', 'written', 'character', 'development', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'beginning', 'show', 'kind-hearted', 'still', 'rather', 'thoughtless', 'young', 'man', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'what', ""'ll"", 'be', 'Once', 'Future', 'King.Though', 'Arthur', 'favorite', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'Colin', 'Morgan', 'best', 'performance', 'title', 'character', 'Richard', 'Wilson', 'fine', 'Gaius', 'nothing', 'revelatory', 'performance', 'just', 'good', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'Uther', 'character', 'love', 'hate', 'obviously', 'having', 'ball', 'Angel', 'Coulby', 'Guinevere', 'really', 'actress', 'show', 'Gwen', 'character', 'Indeed', 'now', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'have', 'aired', 'would', 'say', 'Colin', 'Angel', 'are', 'show', 'strongest', 'actors', 'Katie', 'McGrath', 'out', 'main', 'cast', 'infamous', 'sorceress', 'Morgana', 'Katie', 'fine', 'actress', 'love', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'weakest', 'actor', 'main', 'cast', 'improve', 'course', 'show', 'however.All', 'unlikely', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'Merlin', 'not', 'only', 'become', 'favorite', 'adaptation', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'books', 'movies', 'TV', 'productions', 'based', 'currently', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'TV', 'best', 'thing', 'season', 'Season', 'two', 'was', 'miles', 'better', 'season', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'almost', 'encourage', 'potential', 'viewers', 'start', 'season', 'two', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'idea', 'watching', 'show', 'order', 'so', 'abhorrent', 'season', 'three', 'best', 'yet', 'far', 'was', 'overjoyed', 'hear', 'was', 'renewed', 'fourth', 'season', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'pattern', 'season', 'being', 'better', 'last', 'Also', 'here', 'hoping', 'do', 'get', 'fifth', 'final', 'season']",Merlin: Season 1
1214111,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B001LF347E,Enjolras,"[4, 5]","Merlin seems like an attempt to build off the success of Harry Potter - a TV show about teenage wizards and princes. The series is loosely based on the legend of King Arthur and Merlin in Camelot. I say loosely because it is essentially about the adventures of young Arthur and Merlin. Each episode, the two get into trouble, very much like the early Harry Potter books. However, this show has a lot more spirit than the over-produced Harry Potter movies.What I really appreciate about the show is its maturity, despite its focus on younger characters. The humor is (generally) not slapstick humor, but rather in emphasizing the absurdity of the situations Arthur and Merlin find themselves in. The show gets dark at times and doesn't shy away from death, but also keeps it in good taste - unlike HBO's Game of Thrones, which seems to delight in bloodshed.Merlin also develops its characters, something very hard to do on a TV show. Most TV shows tend to focus on the ""threat of the week"" and rush over character development. It's not uncommon for the characters to remain the same throughout. However, Merlin's characters do have their respective journeys. Arthur in particular goes from callous knight to mature ruler with a sense of responsibility. The show also treats the other characters subtly with few heroes and villains. I especially appreciate how Uther Pendragon is never portrayed as simply a villain, but rather a king with heavy emotional and political burdens to bear.Moreover, Merlin stays true to the atmosphere of the Middle-Ages, with a few obvious deviations.

1214113,A1DA6E4FNRSAWN,B001LF347E,Furio,"[1, 1]","All in all I enjoyed this first season quite a lot.Professionally scripted, filmed and acted, it heavily relies on the charm of the Arthurian myth and on the free use of magic so fashionable these years providing the viewer with hours of easy entertainment. A little TOO easy at times.Said viewer could be even a child of about 10 if a parent were there to do some explaining.That the main purpose of this series be entertainment is perfectly legitimate, but I am convinced that things could and should have been done better even within this limited scope.First and foremost there are heavy qualitative differences in the 13 episodes: scripted and directed by different people they are remarkably different in achievements. Take for instance the episode before the last: throughout there is great attention paid to lighting, to framing and composition. The result is that this episode is vastly superior from every point of view. And it shows, it really does. Why was this attention not paid to all of them?Another irritating problem is the actors' diction: in the first episode it is very theatrical, cristal clear, perfect. Elsewhere, but not everywhere, the same actors slur whole sentences forcing me to use subtitles. Why? Have the creators not established guidelines?They should have. The series is full of inconsistencies (and sketchy plots/characterization/ethics). For example at the start Merlin is said to be capable of making spells with no mouthed incantation. Elsewhere he has to speak just to open a closed door. Sorry, but these mistakes irritate me a lot.To talk about some inconsistencies forces me to introduce others that may be less relevant if one accepts that this series was originally meant for entertainment only. I can see that it might as well be only me who wishes for more attention to be paid to details.The Arthurian myth is extraordinarily confused but if I am not wrong the life of Arthur is supposed to be set in the first centuries A.D. when the Roman army was retiring from Britain and the Latin-Celtic world was collapsing into small states, often at war with each other and facing the first waves of the Anglo-Saxon invasion.I might be wrong but this series seems to be set much later, when Anglo-Saxons were already established and mixed with the rest: Arthur's father is called Uther, for instance, and there are runes -which are Germanic only- everywhere. I am under the impression that most incantations are pronounced in Old English instead of some kind of Celtic. Camelot itself is an enormous, full fledged castle, something I would expect in the X century or even later and several details in the scenes appear to be wrong.Another point is the choice of black actors. Those playing Gwen and her father especially, but there were quite a lot of extras too.Do NOT misunderstand me: they are fine professionals, I loved them, but I somehow doubt that in V century Britain there were so many people of colour, not to mention among the knights.A further point is that the dialogues/gestures and even ethics sound too modern for the time. Was this really necessary for entertainment's sake? Was it not possible to fetch an historian and have him revise the production while preserving the fun?There are several other points I could make but I shall leave it to you to decide for yourself; allow me to stress that a little more accuracy would have been welcomed.Some less sketchy dialogues would have been too: all actors do a decent job and could surely afford better lines and deeper ethics/attitudes.An interesting issue other reviewers have pointed out are the homosexual undertones in the series, especially -and understandably- in the relationship between Arthur and Merlin. Nothing for prudes to worry about though, there is nothing explicit as there is nothing sexual of any sort in any line of the script for any character in the whole first season. It is just a feeling.",3,easy fun or opportunity lost?,1245715200,"06 23, 2009",2009,3920,"['enjoyed', 'first', 'season', 'quite', 'lot.Professionally', 'scripted', 'filmed', 'acted', 'heavily', 'charm', 'Arthurian', 'myth', 'free', 'use', 'magic', 'so', 'fashionable', 'years', 'providing', 'viewer', 'hours', 'easy', 'entertainment', 'little', 'TOO', 'easy', 'times.Said', 'viewer', 'could', 'be', 'even', 'child', 'about', '10', 'parent', 'were', 'there', 'do', 'main', 'purpose', 'series', 'be', 'entertainment', 'perfectly', 'legitimate', 'am', 'convinced', 'things', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'even', 'limited', 'scope.First', 'foremost', 'are', 'heavy', 'qualitative', 'differences', '13', 'episodes', 'scripted', 'directed', 'different', 'people', 'are', 'remarkably', 'different', 'achievements', 'Take', 'instance', 'episode', 'last', 'great', 'attention', 'paid', 'lighting', 'framing', 'composition', 'result', 'episode', 'vastly', 'superior', 'point', 'view', 'really', 'Why', 'was', 'attention', 'not', 'paid', 'irritating', 'problem', 'actors', 'diction', 'first', 'episode', 'very', 'theatrical', 'cristal', 'clear', 'perfect', 'Elsewhere', 'not', 'everywhere', 'same', 'actors', 'slur', 'whole', 'sentences', 'forcing', 'use', 'subtitles', 'Why', 'Have', 'creators', 'not', 'established', 'guidelines', 'should', 'have', 'series', 'full', 'inconsistencies', 'sketchy', 'plots/characterization/ethics', 'example', 'start', 'Merlin', 'said', 'be', 'capable', 'making', 'spells', 'mouthed', 'incantation', 'Elsewhere', 'speak', 'just', 'open', 'closed', 'door', 'Sorry', 'mistakes', 'irritate', 'lot.To', 'talk', 'inconsistencies', 'forces', 'introduce', 'others', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'relevant', 'one', 'series', 'was', 'originally', 'meant', 'entertainment', 'only', 'can', 'see', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'only', 'who', 'more', 'attention', 'be', 'paid', 'details.The', 'Arthurian', 'myth', 'extraordinarily', 'confused', 'am', 'not', 'wrong', 'life', 'Arthur', 'supposed', 'be', 'set', 'first', 'centuries', 'A.D.', 'when', 'Roman', 'army', 'was', 'retiring', 'Britain', 'Latin-Celtic', 'world', 'was', 'collapsing', 'small', 'states', 'often', 'war', 'other', 'facing', 'first', 'waves', 'Anglo-Saxon', 'invasion.I', 'might', 'be', 'wrong', 'series', 'be', 'set', 'much', 'later', 'when', 'Anglo-Saxons', 'were', 'already', 'established', 'mixed', 'rest', 'Arthur', 'father', 'called', 'Uther', 'instance', 'are', 'runes', '-which', 'are', 'Germanic', 'only-', 'everywhere', 'am', 'impression', 'most', 'incantations', 'are', 'pronounced', 'Old', 'English', 'instead', 'kind', 'Celtic', 'Camelot', 'enormous', 'full', 'fledged', 'castle', 'something', 'would', 'expect', 'X', 'century', 'even', 'later', 'several', 'details', 'scenes', 'appear', 'be', 'wrong.Another', 'point', 'choice', 'black', 'actors', 'playing', 'Gwen', 'father', 'especially', 'were', 'quite', 'lot', 'extras', 'NOT', 'misunderstand', 'are', 'fine', 'professionals', 'loved', 'somehow', 'doubt', 'V', 'century', 'Britain', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'colour', 'not', 'mention', 'knights.A', 'further', 'point', 'dialogues/gestures', 'even', 'ethics', 'sound', 'too', 'modern', 'time', 'Was', 'really', 'necessary', 'entertainment', 'sake', 'Was', 'not', 'possible', 'fetch', 'historian', 'have', 'revise', 'production', 'preserving', 'fun', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'points', 'could', 'make', 'shall', 'leave', 'decide', 'allow', 'stress', 'little', 'more', 'accuracy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcomed.Some', 'less', 'sketchy', 'dialogues', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'actors', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'could', 'surely', 'afford', 'better', 'lines', 'deeper', 'ethics/attitudes.An', 'interesting', 'issue', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'are', 'homosexual', 'undertones', 'series', 'especially', '-and', 'understandably-', 'relationship', 'Arthur', 'Merlin', 'Nothing', 'prudes', 'worry', 'nothing', 'explicit', 'nothing', 'sexual', 'sort', 'line', 'script', 'character', 'whole', 'first', 'season', 'just', 'feeling']",Merlin: Season 1

Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[2, 2]","This high-gloss reimagining of the King Arthur legend combines many elements of the original with the best of a modern teen drama, losing no adventure in the union.  By focusing on Arthur and Merlin coming of age, the creative team presents interesting tension between medieval and modern sensibilities.  And unlike Thomas Malory's classic, which reads like an outline, this version of the Matter of Britain feels both complete and detailed.Angel Coulby as young Guinevere probably stands out most among an amazing ensemble.  Presenting the future queen as a servant, subject to class derision, opens the story to options it may continue to explore in future seasons.  Colin Morgan's awkward, affable, but secretive Merlin makes a good contrast to Bradley James' outsized Arthur.  Only Katie McGrath's Morgana seems underdeveloped, mainly used as a contrast to Anthony Head's traditionalist King Uther.The series' episodic structure gives characters multiple dynamic opportunities to test their mettle and develop into maturity.  For instance, over the arc of this season, Arthur develops humility and a willingness to sacrifice himself for those under his authority.  Merlin, by contrast, learns discretion, and perhaps even more important, the art of doing right for reasons that don't involve recognition.  These lessons, while not revolutionary, at least make good drama.Playful, energetic, and brash, this series probably won't reinvent Arthurian mythology from the ground up, but it certainly makes a good contemporary addition to the tradition.  By grabbing ahold of minor traditional details and expanding or upending them into one-hour episodes, it beautifully unpacks the mythology while creating a series that feels new.

This version of the youth of Merlin is very much in the medieval tradition, while appealing to the modern viewer. FIrst of all, it satisfies, like much popular medieval literature, the people's curiosity about the youth of its heroes. In this way is is typical of the medieval spinoff.  It also uses all the old forms of romance and fabliau, but the boys, Arthur and Merlin, are lovely.

1214142,A2OJLXP2C2A2EW,B001LF347E,mijcar,"[0, 0]","I must admit something very embarrassing.  Although this is the worst television series I have ever seen, I watched all five seasons!I did.  I really did.  Why?  Because my kids wanted to see it, and I watched with them.  I couldn't believe it would get any worse, and yet each episode did, as did each season after the previous one.My six-year old loved it and my twelve-year old liked it, so it definitely found itself an audience.Be warned.  I will be giving spoilers.  But these spoilers will not make any difference because there are no surprises in this series.First, don't expect the traditional story of Kind Arthur and Merlin in which Merlin is already an old man when he meets the young man will become King Arthur.  In this series, Merlin and Arthur are of an age with each other.It begins with a teenage, Merlin, arriving at Camelot and running into a bullying knight who is -- surprise, surprise -- Prince Arthur.  Soon we meet Arthur's father King Uther who has a thing about wizards and witches and any practitioner of magic:  he hates them, hunts them, and kills them.  The backstory explaining this loathing is ridiculous but nonetheless makes more sense than anything else in the series.Okay, I was willing to give it a chance.  The premise was interesting and I wanted to see where they would go with it.There are only a few major plot lines over this long series:First and foremost,  Merlin must never reveal that he has magic because if he does, he will be reported to Uther and will suffer a hideous death.Second, Merlin must survive because he is the midwife (in a manner of speaking) to the growth of Arthur as Arhur reaches manhood and the throne of Camelot.  It is Merlin's Fate to do this as it is Arthur's fate to become king.Third, Merlin becomes Arthur's servant and stays in that role for the entire series, not to reveal his prowess to Arthur until the next to last episode's of the series despite their relationship sometimes seeming to actually be a friendship.Fourth, Arthur is stupid.  No, Arthur can tie his own shoes even though Merlin does it for him, but he isn't really capable of making an intelligent decision.  For example, despite Merlin saving his life approximately once per episode, for almost 20 episodes per season, Arthur never seems to correlate the mysterious events and Merlin's mysterious disappearances.Fifth, Merlin is cold, callous, and almost equally stupid.  The premise is that Merlin is warm, caring, and very smart, but since the writer's of this nonsense didn't seem to possess any of these qualities themselves, they didn't pass them on to their characters.In order to protect himself, for the sake of Arthur of course, Merlin watches hundreds, thousands or magic-cursed people being slaughtered by first Uther and then even Arthur.  Perhaps he has some excuse (not really, but what the heck, pretend he did); but there is no excuse under Arthur.The premise seems to be that the ends justifies the means.  Supposedly Arthur was going to bring peace, prosperity and a return of magic to the land of Camelot; and therefore no price was too high; but as Arthur doesn't end up bringing these things to Camelot, then all those heaps of dead bodies were a waste beyond imagining.And that's just the beginning.  Guided by a magical dragon and the court physician Gaius, Merlin is led to incredibly bad decisions.  For example, young Morgana who is a ward of Uther and discovering her own magical abilities needs someone to talk to in her time of loneliness and fear.  She needs to know she is not alone.  If Merlin would only take the risk of revealing himself to her, her entire future would probably have been different, particular as her character has been developed to that point.  But, no, Merlin doesn't reveal himself and eventually Morgana is led astray by someone who does reach out to her, someone who has cause to hate Uther and Camelot.  Merlin's decisions follow from the advice of Gaius and the dragon.  When he listens to them, he is wrong; when he follows his conscience, he is right; but his conscience slips season by season into a dark soulessness hidden by a clueless smile.And then there's Mordred who is a young boy with magical powers who feels there is no one in Camelot who he can trust and no one there who understands what it is like to have magic.  And Merlin has the chance to reveal himself ... and wait a moment! wasn't that the plot of the last paragraph?  Oops, guess the series has some wicked lack of imagination.Here is what is truly awful.  None of this would have happened if it weren't for Merlin showing up and trying to prevent.  It's like Back to the Future gone terribly wrong (or without a single writer with an IQ over 40) in which the preventer is the cause.  Wait a moment, there's a series called Terminator ... but, no, in that series, the writers knew what they were doing (at least as much as possible when playing games with time travel), but in this series the writers were playing games with fate and were totally, completely, horribly, depressingly, sadly, miserably incompetent to do so.And that's all of my this junk is worth.  It helped me bond with my kids and if it helps you bond with yours, why, heaven bless you.

I love the actors, the stories, the comedy, the special effects, superb job all around.  In particular, Colin Morgan as Merlin is fantastic and Anthony Head is someone you love to hate as Uther.  The Dragon made me laugh more than once - I just loved his attitude and I even understood his act of revenge at the end of Season 2.  I also REALLY like the way the Arthur/Gwen story has developed - Season 1, he didn't pay her any mind and you can tell there was a concerted effort to make Gwen as plain Jane as possible while Morgana was a stunning beauty.  Season 2, you notice that Gwen looks more attractive but Arthur doesn't notice the beauty, he notices the courage (when she saves his life) and her intelligence, spunk and wisdom when he stays in her home. The point is that the story of Arthur & Gwen always revolves around a love at first sight kind of meeting but I think the way the writers have chosen to tell the story, is more meaningful and a great twist on a timeless love story. A powerful and handsome man like Arthur can have any beauty in the land on his arm but as we see him grow from an arrogant boy into a more humble and considerate prince, his perspective about true beauty changes as well and I love it. They've managed to take Arthur from someone you'd despise in the first few episodes to someone you admire because he is kind and gentle, he has a good heart and is trying to learn how to be a benevolent ruler.Even though I was able to watch all of the episodes for free (either on Syfy or youtube), it's really saying something that I want to purchase the series to have in my collection!

You begin to see how one person can influence another for good over the long haul (and Arthur needs it)! The relationship between Merlin and Gaius is also delightful to watch. These three actors are phenomenal and certainly carry the show. The sets are amazingly authentic...you feel like you are right there in the middle of it all. For a TV show it is certainly beyond what I have come to expect and is great family entertainment (except for young children due to some scary themes/scenes).,5,"Great story line, set and character development!",1265760000,"02 10, 2010",2010,636,"['far', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'quickly', 'relationship', 'Merlin', 'Arthur', 'begin', 'see', 'how', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'influence', 'good', 'long', 'haul', 'Arthur', 'relationship', 'Merlin', 'Gaius', 'also', 'delightful', 'watch', 'three', 'actors', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'certainly', 'carry', 'show', 'sets', 'are', 'amazingly', 'authentic', 'feel', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'middle', 'TV', 'show', 'certainly', 'what', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'great', 'family', 'entertainment', 'young', 'children', 'due', 'scary', 'themes/scenes']",Merlin: Season 1
1214150,A22PV91A5CNOGO,B001LF347E,"NY film buff ""A reader from NY, NY""","[29, 30]","I confess that when I first heard of this BBC import I had no intention of watching it. For starters, it deviated too far from the standard Arthurian legends. And when I heard about CG dragons and pseudo-medieval costuming I decided it would be a total dud.I couldn't have been more wrong. The series is absolutely delightful, in spite of minor flaws like occasionally sketchy plots and dialogue. It was clearly aimed at young viewers--perhaps the early to mid-teen set--but surprise, surprise! It has garnered a devoted adult following, to which I now belong. A lot of this is due to the charm of the (mostly youthful) cast, a bunch of attractive newcomers who overcome the periodic silliness of the storylines with their genuine acting chops and ability to swashbuckle with just the right amount of aplomb combined with humor. A degree of gravitas is provided by Richard Wilson as the court physician Gaius and Anthony Head as a narrow-minded, stern (nay, hard-assed!) King Uther Pendragon, and John Hurt, who voices the clairvoyant old dragon chained beneath Uther's castle at Camelot. But the lead actors--Colin Morgan as young Merlin and Bradley James as Prince Arthur--undoubtedly steal the show.In this non-conventional take on Camelot, Prince Arthur is something of an arrogant bully with a heart of gold, who becomes genuinely fond of and dependant upon Merlin, the gawky, bumbling, admittedly adorable youth he takes as a manservant. What he doesn't yet know is that Merlin is a gifted sorcerer, who must conceal his abilities because King Uther has outlawed (on pain of death) the practice of any form of magic. In spite of the royal ban, it is Merlin's destiny--as Gaius and the imprisoned dragon repeatedly assure him--to look after Arthur, protect him from harm, and make certain that he survives the sniping of his enemies to become king of Camelot someday. The job isn't always a picnic; Arthur can be a pain in the royal butt at times, and his prowess as a warrior places him in constant danger. Merlin (whose blue eyes turn CG gold when he performs magic) is periodically aided by other inhabitants of Camelot, most specifically Morgana (Katie McGrath), Uther's beautiful ward, and Guinevere, known as Gwen (Angel Coulby), who is Morgana's maid. All in all the cast appears to to having a grand old time with this morphed rendition of the King Arthur story, and they clearly have an excellent chemistry with one another. As the New York Times quipped, this is Camelot in the Age of Obama: commoners and nobles address each other by their first names and Guinevere is a servant, not a princess, and is played by a lovely actress of mixed ethnic background. Best of all, Merlin and Arthur are perfect foils for one another in looks and in character. The slim, angular Mr. Morgan, with his lanky grace, black hair, elvish ears and changeable blue eyes gives us a Merlin who is by turns comical, serious, and intense, shy yet self-assertive in the face of Arthur's bullying. Mr. James, a classically handsome blond with mobile features, pouty rock-and-roll lips, and an athletic physique, plays Arthur as a spoiled princeling with a sense of entitlement, who nevertheless clearly cares about his subjects and hides a kindness and compassion beneath an arrogant exterior.As the mother of a teenager who adores the show, it has been a (guilty) pleasure for me to watch this series unfold. I look forward to a second season. When a U.S.-compatible DVD set is issued, I hope it includes the cast's video diaries from the British DVD release. These ""diaries,"" which contain some hilarious escapades (both on and off set) featuring the young actors, as well as moments of highly amusing banter between Mr. James and Mr. Morgan, and Mr. James and Ms. Coulby, are definitely worth a watch.",4,"A delightful alternative view of Merlin, Arthur, and Camelot",1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,3795,"['confess', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'BBC', 'import', 'had', 'intention', 'watching', 'starters', 'deviated', 'too', 'far', 'standard', 'Arthurian', 'when', 'heard', 'CG', 'dragons', 'pseudo-medieval', 'costuming', 'decided', 'would', 'be', 'total', 'dud.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'wrong', 'series', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'spite', 'minor', 'flaws', 'occasionally', 'sketchy', 'plots', 'dialogue', 'was', 'clearly', 'aimed', 'young', 'viewers', 'perhaps', 'early', 'mid-teen', 'set', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'garnered', 'devoted', 'adult', 'following', 'now', 'belong', 'lot', 'due', 'charm', 'mostly', 'youthful', 'cast', 'bunch', 'attractive', 'newcomers', 'who', 'overcome', 'periodic', 'silliness', 'storylines', 'genuine', 'acting', 'chops', 'ability', 'swashbuckle', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'aplomb', 'combined', 'humor', 'degree', 'gravitas', 'provided', 'Richard', 'Wilson', 'court', 'physician', 'Gaius', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'narrow-minded', 'stern', 'nay', 'hard-assed', 'King', 'Uther', 'Pendragon', 'John', 'Hurt', 'who', 'clairvoyant', 'old', 'dragon', 'chained', 'Uther', 'castle', 'Camelot', 'lead', 'actors', 'Colin', 'Morgan', 'young', 'Merlin', 'Bradley', 'James', 'Prince', 'Arthur', 'undoubtedly', 'steal', 'show.In', 'non-conventional', 'take', 'Camelot', 'Prince', 'Arthur', 'something', 'arrogant', 'bully', 'heart', 'gold', 'who', 'genuinely', 'fond', 'dependant', 'Merlin', 'gawky', 'bumbling', 'admittedly', 'adorable', 'youth', 'manservant', 'What', ""n't"", 'yet', 'know', 'Merlin', 'gifted', 'sorcerer', 'who', 'must', 'conceal', 'abilities', 'King', 'Uther', 'outlawed', 'pain', 'death', 'practice', 'form', 'magic', 'spite', 'royal', 'ban', 'Merlin', 'destiny', 'Gaius', 'imprisoned', 'dragon', 'repeatedly', 'assure', 'look', 'Arthur', 'protect', 'harm', 'make', 'certain', 'sniping', 'enemies', 'become', 'king', 'Camelot', 'someday', 'job', ""n't"", 'always', 'picnic', 'Arthur', 'can', 'be', 'pain', 'royal', 'butt', 'times', 'prowess', 'warrior', 'places', 'constant', 'danger', 'Merlin', 'blue', 'eyes', 'turn', 'CG', 'gold', 'when', 'magic', 'periodically', 'aided', 'other', 'inhabitants', 'Camelot', 'most', 'specifically', 'Morgana', 'Katie', 'McGrath', 'Uther', 'beautiful', 'ward', 'Guinevere', 'known', 'Gwen', 'Angel', 'Coulby', 'who', 'Morgana', 'maid', 'cast', 'having', 'grand', 'old', 'time', 'morphed', 'rendition', 'King', 'Arthur', 'story', 'clearly', 'have', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'one', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'quipped', 'Camelot', 'Age', 'Obama', 'commoners', 'nobles', 'address', 'other', 'first', 'names', 'Guinevere', 'servant', 'not', 'princess', 'played', 'lovely', 'actress', 'mixed', 'ethnic', 'background', 'Best', 'Merlin', 'Arthur', 'are', 'perfect', 'foils', 'one', 'looks', 'character', 'slim', 'angular', 'Mr.', 'Morgan', 'lanky', 'grace', 'black', 'hair', 'elvish', 'ears', 'changeable', 'blue', 'eyes', 'Merlin', 'who', 'turns', 'comical', 'serious', 'intense', 'shy', 'yet', 'self-assertive', 'face', 'Arthur', 'bullying', 'Mr.', 'James', 'classically', 'handsome', 'blond', 'mobile', 'features', 'pouty', 'rock-and-roll', 'lips', 'athletic', 'physique', 'Arthur', 'spoiled', 'princeling', 'sense', 'entitlement', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'clearly', 'subjects', 'kindness', 'compassion', 'arrogant', 'exterior.As', 'mother', 'teenager', 'who', 'show', 'been', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'series', 'unfold', 'look', 'forward', 'second', 'season', 'When', 'U.S.-compatible', 'DVD', 'set', 'issued', 'hope', 'cast', 'video', 'diaries', 'British', 'DVD', 'release', 'diaries', 'contain', 'hilarious', 'escapades', 'set', 'featuring', 'young', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'moments', 'highly', 'amusing', 'banter', 'Mr.', 'James', 'Mr.', 'Morgan', 'Mr.', 'James', 'Ms.', 'Coulby', 'are', 'definitely', 'watch']",Merlin: Season 1

The music was well done and often epic enough to make people in the next room wander in asking if I was watching the lord of the rings trilogy! The acting was overall excellent, the storylines well done and the landscapes and environments were beautiful. The special effects were a bit spotty, but this is television and there are budgets and time considerations so I wasn't expecting brilliance there. Very good for tv of course. I'd have to say that the show is probably meant for young adults, but its enjoyable if you are not expecting very intricate plots. I enjoyed season one enough to buy the second season, and that was even better.I have only one issue with season one, and you should stop here if you wish to avoid even a hint of spoilers.My only complaint with season one was how very little changed during the course of the show. There were no major relationship changes, no major revelations, no major deaths (perhaps one minor side death). Things 'reset' to a comfortable norm by the end of episodes, which can be rather dull after a time because you start to anticipate that new enemies don't really mean anything, as everything will just go back to the way it was and everyone will live happily ever after at the end of it all. I'm happy to say, this is NOT an issue in season two. If you liked season one, you will like the show even more as it progresses.

So, assuming the US release will be the same, this DVD not only contains 13 exceptionally good episodes but lots and lots of interesting extra features that will bring you up close and personal with the utterly CHARMING stars of this great show.I say great, because season 1 of Merlin (comparing it to the other recent family-friendly BBC shows that I've seen) is orders of magnitude better than Robin Hood, and solidly better than season 1 of Doctor Who. The stories, while not especially complex, are very entertaining and colorful, and the fresh, young actors are all really fantastic finds. I would say that Bradley James as Arthur slightly edges out the rest to be the best of the lot, and Colin Morgan is so fascinating you can't take your eyes off him. The writing is fast and witty with lots of humor and some surprising depth. And the castle is real!So, season 1 of Merlin is most definitely worth buying, keeping, and watching more than once.Oh, but wait until you see what's coming next! Also via Amazon UK I also have Merlin season 2. And if season 1 is great, season 2 is utterly fantastic!! I won't say too much or give anything away, but I will say this: they chose the right actors.

Acting is also pretty good too, but not quite as good as say the Robin Hood series, but acceptable, from what I've seen.But I will say this though...why is it is that all these shows like this, always go the teen-age angst route?  Can we not have adult-driven genre shows like this?  A darker adult Camelot action-adventure/drama would be interesting.  And spending a bit more on the CG effects.

Merlin is that show, and how very much worth the wait it was.Based on Arthurian legends, Merlin is the story of a young man destined to become a great Sorcerer. Merlin, both blessed and cursed with incredible gifts of magic, is sent by his mother to the legendary Camelot to seek comfort and like-minded people. Once he arrives, he finds out that all magic has been banned from the kingdom by the cold-hearted King Uther Pendragon and anyone found practising will be immediately sentenced to death. He is taken in by Gaius, the Court physician, who quickly becomes his mentor. After saving the life of Uther's son, Arthur, Merlin is hired as the Prince's manservent. He quickly becomes echanted by the King's ward, the beautiful Lady Morgana (who has ""gifts"" of her own), and befriends her servent Guinevere. As the series progresses, Merlin becomes increasingly more powerful and it becomes difficult for him to hide his gifts from those around him. Only Gaius and the wise Great Dragon (behind held captive in the castle's dungeon, to whom Merlin often goes for wisdom and guidance) know his true self.This is a beautifully shot, brilliantly scripted, wonderfully acted show. The actors are phenominal in their understated style and are all so very talented, and deliver their material flawlessly with immense grace, so much that you forget they are acting. The production value is superb (that is one awesome, fearful dragon). The story every week has heart, humor and shows the evolution of the characters in a poignant way. In every great legendary story is tragedy and heartbreak, and Merlin is no exception. Each character goes through a personal tragedy in some way, giving the show a serious Shakespearean quality.Now, onto the DVD set itself. The transfers are high quality, meaning you get sharp & clear video and crisp audio. The packaging is standard (the cardboard ""booklet"" is a tri-fold and the show discs slightly overlap one another). The real gem about this set, however, are the special features! There are hours of fantastic featurettes featuring the entire cast in candid moments, in all stages of production. I honestly can't remember the last time I enjoyed features as much as these. I laughed out loud more times than I can count!To summarize, if you haven't seen ""Merlin"" yet, do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this DVD set. Take several hours and immerse yourself in a land of myth and a time of magic.",5,"No Young Man, No Matter How Great, Can Know his Destiny.",1284076800,"09 10, 2010",2010,2535,"['more', '20', 'year', 'hiatus', 'BBC', 'one', 'shows', 'major', 'American', 'network', 'Merlin', 'show', 'how', 'very', 'much', 'wait', 'was.Based', 'Arthurian', 'legends', 'Merlin', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'destined', 'become', 'great', 'Sorcerer', 'Merlin', 'blessed', 'cursed', 'incredible', 'gifts', 'magic', 'sent', 'mother', 'legendary', 'Camelot', 'seek', 'comfort', 'like-minded', 'people', 'Once', 'out', 'magic', 'been', 'banned', 'kingdom', 'cold-hearted', 'King', 'Uther', 'Pendragon', 'anyone', 'found', 'practising', 'will', 'be', 'immediately', 'sentenced', 'death', 'taken', 'Gaius', 'Court', 'physician', 'who', 'quickly', 'mentor', 'saving', 'life', 'Uther', 'son', 'Arthur', 'Merlin', 'hired', 'Prince', 'manservent', 'quickly', 'echanted', 'King', 'ward', 'beautiful', 'Lady', 'Morgana', 'who', 'gifts', 'own', 'servent', 'Guinevere', 'series', 'Merlin', 'increasingly', 'more', 'powerful', 'difficult', 'hide', 'gifts', 'Only', 'Gaius', 'wise', 'Great', 'Dragon', 'held', 'captive', 'castle', 'dungeon', 'whom', 'Merlin', 'often', 'wisdom', 'guidance', 'know', 'true', 'self.This', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'brilliantly', 'scripted', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'show', 'actors', 'are', 'phenominal', 'understated', 'style', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'talented', 'deliver', 'material', 'flawlessly', 'immense', 'grace', 'so', 'much', 'forget', 'are', 'acting', 'production', 'value', 'superb', 'one', 'awesome', 'fearful', 'dragon', 'story', 'week', 'heart', 'humor', 'evolution', 'characters', 'poignant', 'way', 'great', 'legendary', 'story', 'tragedy', 'heartbreak', 'Merlin', 'exception', 'character', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'way', 'giving', 'show', 'serious', 'Shakespearean', 'quality.Now', 'DVD', 'set', 'transfers', 'are', 'high', 'quality', 'meaning', 'get', 'sharp', 'clear', 'video', 'crisp', 'audio', 'packaging', 'standard', 'cardboard', 'booklet', 'tri-fold', 'show', 'slightly', 'overlap', 'one', 'real', 'gem', 'set', 'however', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'hours', 'fantastic', 'featurettes', 'featuring', 'entire', 'cast', 'candid', 'moments', 'stages', 'production', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'features', 'as', 'much', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'more', 'times', 'can', 'count', 'summarize', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Merlin', 'yet', 'do', 'favor', 'treat', 'DVD', 'set', 'Take', 'several', 'hours', 'immerse', 'land', 'myth', 'time', 'magic']",Merlin: Season 1
1214164,A1JVG2EUDNQ3HT,B001LF347E,shelly v,"[6, 6]","It's like I've said before for another review: this show is in the vein of the family-friendly fantasy shows which are meant to entertain and not educate.  If you like fantasy and liked Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Xena Warrior Princess, and the BBC Robin Hood series, chances are you'll like Merlin.If you read reviews saying this show isn't historically accurate or doesn't comply with Arthurian legend, take those with a grain of salt.  This show isn't meant to be a scholarly work or documentary of Arthurian legend - it's a fun interpretation of Camelot meant to entertain and it's very well done and thoroughly entertaining IMO.  I'm not saying it's perfect.  The first few episodes tend to rely on the ""villain of the week"" plots that Smallville used to do (makes sense since creator Johnny Capps admitted that Smallville was this show's initial inspiration).  However, the first season finds its footing fairly quickly and eventually moves away from the Smallville formula and into laying the groundwork for telling its own story arcs.  The episodes and storylines become richer as the show hints at the classic Camelot stories that will eventually come to be - Mordred, Lancelot, Excalibur, and of course Morgan le Fay but she's called Morgana here.  There are a few weaknesses (the often-cheesy CGI monsters) but there's a great deal of humor and wonderful acting from a cast mostly made up of unknowns (save for UK acting veterans Anthony Head and Richard Wilson).  The sets, music, costumes and overall production are well done and none of it is ever boring (though some episodes are better than others).But best of all is the wonderfully hilarious but often sweet relationship between the characters of Arthur (Bradley James) and Merlin (Colin Morgan).  Both characters are really fun to watch in a older bullying brother/geeky kid brother kind of vibe.  Bradley James and Colin Morgan have absolutely great chemistry together and really make the characters extremely likable and you just can't help but root for them (well, root for Merlin anyway...Arthur takes a bit longer as you'll see once you watch the pilot).  I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't watched yet, but watch for an absolutely classic scene in one of the episodes where Arthur tries to, er, get Merlin to eat something he doesn't want to eat and hilarity ensues.Speaking of comedy, I'm reviewing this before getting the dvds (obviously since they're not out till April) so I don't know if the US version dvds will have the episode commentary extras that the UK dvds had.  I really hope so but we may be disappointed on that front, which would stink being that the four main young cast commented on ""The Moment of Truth"" and it is so, so funny!  Bradley James was particularly hilarious:Colin:  I had to sit so close to that fire, my lips got burnt.Bradley:  That's why we had to draw on Colin's eyebrows later.  (HAHAHAHA!)Bottom line: really a very fun show and worth watching.",4,"great, wholesome and overall fun fantasy drama for all ages",1264464000,"01 26, 2010",2010,2985,"[""'ve"", 'said', 'review', 'show', 'vein', 'family-friendly', 'fantasy', 'shows', 'are', 'meant', 'entertain', 'not', 'educate', 'like', 'fantasy', 'liked', 'Hercules', 'Legendary', 'Journeys', 'Xena', 'Warrior', 'Princess', 'BBC', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'series', 'chances', 'are', ""'ll"", 'like', 'Merlin.If', 'read', 'reviews', 'saying', 'show', ""n't"", 'historically', 'accurate', ""n't"", 'comply', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'take', 'grain', 'salt', 'show', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'scholarly', 'work', 'documentary', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'fun', 'interpretation', 'Camelot', 'meant', 'entertain', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'IMO', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'perfect', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'tend', 'rely', 'villain', 'week', 'plots', 'Smallville', 'used', 'do', 'sense', 'creator', 'Johnny', 'Capps', 'admitted', 'Smallville', 'was', 'show', 'initial', 'inspiration', 'However', 'first', 'season', 'footing', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'eventually', 'away', 'Smallville', 'formula', 'laying', 'groundwork', 'telling', 'own', 'story', 'arcs', 'episodes', 'storylines', 'become', 'richer', 'show', 'classic', 'Camelot', 'stories', 'will', 'eventually', 'come', 'be', 'Mordred', 'Lancelot', 'Excalibur', 'course', 'Morgan', 'Fay', 'called', 'Morgana', 'here', 'are', 'few', 'weaknesses', 'often-cheesy', 'CGI', 'monsters', 'great', 'deal', 'humor', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'cast', 'mostly', 'made', 'unknowns', 'save', 'UK', 'acting', 'veterans', 'Anthony', 'Head', 'Richard', 'Wilson', 'sets', 'music', 'costumes', 'overall', 'production', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'none', 'ever', 'boring', 'episodes', 'are', 'better', 'others', '.But', 'best', 'wonderfully', 'hilarious', 'often', 'sweet', 'relationship', 'characters', 'Arthur', 'Bradley', 'James', 'Merlin', 'Colin', 'Morgan', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'fun', 'watch', 'older', 'bullying', 'brother/geeky', 'brother', 'kind', 'vibe', 'Bradley', 'James', 'Colin', 'Morgan', 'have', 'absolutely', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'really', 'make', 'characters', 'extremely', 'likable', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'well', 'root', 'Merlin', 'anyway', 'Arthur', 'bit', 'longer', ""'ll"", 'see', 'once', 'watch', 'pilot', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'yet', 'watch', 'absolutely', 'classic', 'scene', 'one', 'episodes', 'where', 'Arthur', 'er', 'get', 'Merlin', 'eat', 'something', ""n't"", 'want', 'eat', 'hilarity', 'ensues.Speaking', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'getting', 'dvds', 'obviously', ""'re"", 'not', 'out', 'April', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'US', 'version', 'dvds', 'will', 'have', 'episode', 'commentary', 'extras', 'UK', 'dvds', 'had', 'really', 'hope', 'so', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'front', 'would', 'stink', 'being', 'four', 'main', 'young', 'cast', 'commented', 'Moment', 'Truth', 'so', 'funny', 'Bradley', 'James', 'was', 'particularly', 'hilarious', 'Colin', 'had', 'sit', 'so', 'close', 'fire', 'lips', 'got', 'burnt.Bradley', 'why', 'had', 'draw', 'Colin', 'eyebrows', 'later', 'HAHAHAHA', 'Bottom', 'line', 'really', 'very', 'fun', 'show', 'worth', 'watching']",Merlin: Season 1

All the actors contributed in each way towards the outcome of the overall resident well-being in Camelot. Colin Morgan cleverly plays the character of a Merlin who must help King Arthur Pendragon(powerfully played by Bradley James) without revealing the use of magic. John Hurt plays a compelling role of ""The Great Dragon"", a being who Merlin secretly consults with for help in magically prevailing over various tests.Richard Wilson plays Gaius, a firm and wise mentor to Merlin. Anthony Head plays the convincing role of Uther Pendragon, a headstrong father to King Arthur who is extremely brutal to those caught practicing magic. However, Head's portrayal of Uther also means well in protecting his son Arthur Pendragon and maintaining a good kingdom for his citizens. Angel Coulby and Katie MCGrath persuasively play the characters of Guinevere and Lady Morgana Pendragon.  I also really enjoyed that the show portrays two female characters that are loyal friends to each other. Additionally, Katie McGrath's Lady Morgana plays an assertive and clairvoyant woman who courageously stands by Angel Coulby's Guinevere character in both happy and adverse times. The first season Merlin dvds contain among the following great bonuses:Behind The Magic (Parts One and Two): All of the characters are covered in their full glory and are shown as down to earth people who just want to contribute towards a meaningful show.Video Diaries divided up by Colin Morgan and Colin, Bradley, plus the Cast: I enjoyed seeing them share what they go through in perfecting various scenes for the series.  It was also great watching all of them having a fun time at a theme park roller coaster.Photo Gallery: There are superb photos of both the key villians and the benevolent characters during the first season.Wallpapers: You have to insert this dvd into your computer, but there are an eclectic assortment of images that one can view for desktop background ideas.There are 13 episodes divided among 4 dvds, with the fifth dvd  featuring the bonuses and wallpaper.

1214171,A2NAM6PUE3TGDU,B001LF347E,Valarie Rose Revels,"[0, 0]","Merlin once again gives an interesting spin to pre-Arthurian Legend with Lancelot and Guinevere.Although we know Gwen (Guinevere) as a servant, a departure from the legends, we now have Lancelot being introduced as not just a commoner, but one whose heart belongs to Guinevere as only one can when ""love at first sight"" happens. Merlin is the catalyst. Lancelot saves Merlin's life, and as thanks he wants to make Lancelot's dream to be a knight of Camelot a reality. But Merlin also sets in motion the start of Guinevere's and Lancelot's romance when he enlists Gwen's help in outfitting Lancelot to pretend he is of noble birth to gain that knighthood.This is one of those episodes that is so sweet with the tentative looks and actions of the two sweethearts, and the nobility and humility of Lancelot. Angel Coulby and Santiago Cabrera seem perfectly matched as the two lovers. The musical themes used to highlight the romance between them and the bravery of Lancelot seem to underscore those moments quite brilliantly.A very enjoyable take on the Legend of Guinevere and Lancelot.",4,Unique Start to the Legend of Guinevere and Lancelot,1323820800,"12 14, 2011",2011,1084,"['Merlin', 'once', 'again', 'interesting', 'spin', 'pre-Arthurian', 'Legend', 'Lancelot', 'Guinevere.Although', 'know', 'Gwen', 'Guinevere', 'servant', 'departure', 'legends', 'now', 'have', 'Lancelot', 'being', 'introduced', 'not', 'just', 'commoner', 'one', 'heart', 'Guinevere', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'when', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Merlin', 'catalyst', 'Lancelot', 'Merlin', 'life', 'thanks', 'make', 'Lancelot', 'dream', 'be', 'knight', 'Camelot', 'reality', 'Merlin', 'also', 'motion', 'start', 'Guinevere', 'Lancelot', 'romance', 'when', 'Gwen', 'help', 'outfitting', 'Lancelot', 'pretend', 'noble', 'birth', 'gain', 'knighthood.This', 'one', 'episodes', 'so', 'sweet', 'tentative', 'looks', 'actions', 'two', 'sweethearts', 'nobility', 'humility', 'Lancelot', 'Angel', 'Coulby', 'Santiago', 'Cabrera', 'seem', 'perfectly', 'matched', 'two', 'lovers', 'musical', 'themes', 'used', 'highlight', 'romance', 'bravery', 'Lancelot', 'seem', 'underscore', 'moments', 'quite', 'brilliantly.A', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'take', 'Legend', 'Guinevere', 'Lancelot']",Merlin: Season 1

Nine episodes later I was still watching. I think the acting is superb. If you are on the edge of your seat worrying about characters getting killed that you know grow up to be adults then the actors have done their job. Usually in magical productions, the characters are much more two-dimensional. Here, you have real people, even with the magic. They make mistakes, sometimes what seems to be a good idea turns out to be a bad idea. I love the dragon (I like dragons) and John Hurt has done an excellent job (as always) with the voice. I love the scenery. 'Cheesy' is when they do everything on a sound stage - that's 'cheesy'. This production has plenty of scenes that expand out into the 'real world'. I like that I know the story so I know how these characters will turn out - turning this into a prequel of how it all came to be.
