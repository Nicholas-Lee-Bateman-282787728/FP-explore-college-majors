1320880,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,B00347AIS0,Bold Consumer,"[2, 2]","This was Audrey Hepburn's last starring role, and one not to be missed if you love her films. I have enjoyed almost every movie Audrey Hepburn made. This one is no exception. It's a fun adventure. Lots of action! As a viewer, I knew from the beginning that we were being led into a twisted plot with lots of switches and surprises, and I loved every minute of it. She is obviously older than we're used to seeing her, but always elegant with a hint of mischief.  This one can be enjoyed by the whole family. I noticed that her favorite designer, Givenchy, designed the evening gowns she wore in the movie. Nice touch!Audrey Hepburn plays the role of an elegant, wealthy Baroness. Her almost-frail vulnerability is charming.Robert Wagner is the clumsy, unsophisticated oaf who just happens to appear whenever she needs him---but is he one of the good guys, or one of the bad guys? Is he employed by Interpol? a master thief? a killer? or just a good-natured guy who bumbled into her life? You won't know till the end.  I even loved all of the supporting characters, good and bad. They were all great.My copy did stop at a certain point and I had to go back to the beginning. I also should have dusted it off before I played it. I pulled it out, cleaned it, and it worked fine after that. The movie was worth the effort.",5,Fun Adventure with a 'Mature' Audrey Hepburn and Charming Robert Wagner,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,1318,"['was', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'last', 'starring', 'role', 'one', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'love', 'films', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'almost', 'movie', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'made', 'one', 'exception', 'fun', 'adventure', 'Lots', 'action', 'viewer', 'knew', 'beginning', 'were', 'being', 'led', 'twisted', 'plot', 'lots', 'switches', 'surprises', 'loved', 'minute', 'obviously', 'older', ""'re"", 'used', 'seeing', 'always', 'elegant', 'hint', 'mischief', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'whole', 'family', 'noticed', 'favorite', 'designer', 'Givenchy', 'designed', 'evening', 'gowns', 'wore', 'movie', 'Nice', 'touch', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'role', 'elegant', 'wealthy', 'Baroness', 'almost-frail', 'vulnerability', 'charming.Robert', 'Wagner', 'clumsy', 'unsophisticated', 'oaf', 'who', 'just', 'appear', 'whenever', '-but', 'one', 'good', 'guys', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'employed', 'Interpol', 'master', 'thief', 'killer', 'just', 'good-natured', 'guy', 'who', 'bumbled', 'life', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'till', 'end', 'even', 'loved', 'supporting', 'characters', 'good', 'bad', 'were', 'great.My', 'copy', 'did', 'stop', 'certain', 'point', 'had', 'go', 'back', 'beginning', 'also', 'should', 'have', 'dusted', 'off', 'played', 'pulled', 'out', 'cleaned', 'worked', 'fine', 'movie', 'was', 'worth', 'effort']",Love Among Thieves
