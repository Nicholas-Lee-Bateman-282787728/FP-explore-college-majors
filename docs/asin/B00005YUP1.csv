690808,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B00005YUP1,A Customer,"[5, 6]","Paragraph 175 is a powerful documentary that deals with a provocative subject. I just wish filmmakers Jeffrey Friedman and Rob Epstein had fleshed out the subject a bit more. While this film about gay men who were persecuted and imprisoned under the Nazi regime, is in many respects absorbing, the film ultimately suffers from an overly narrow and constricted focus.Perhaps the problem was that there were just not enough men alive today who were willing to talk about their experiences. From the outset, the pool of interviewees was certainly going to be limited, but also limited is the actual archival footage of life in the concentration camps.Instead the directors have chosen to pepper the film with well-preserved family photographs, and lively footage of gay and lesbian culture blossoming during the days of the Weimar Republic after WW1. Sensitively narrated by British actor Rupert Everett, Paragraph 175 is all about the German penal code, which was originally enacted in 1871, and later used by the Nazis, to outlaw homosexuality.The penal code stated: ""An unnatural sex act committed between persons of male sex is punishable by imprisonment; the loss of civil rights may also be imposed,"" But Paragraph 175 was never really enforced until the Nazi's came to power. This documentary centers on six emotional accounts of the most elderly and frail survivors of the concentration camps who, up until now, have repressed their stories.There's a Jewish gay resistance fighter who posed as a Hitler Youth member to rescue his lover from a Gestapo transfer camp in an ultimately futile effort; a photographer who was arrested and imprisoned for homosexuality, who upon his release joined the army because of the lack of men in his hometown and he ""wanted to be with men.""There's a young man who was freed from a sentence at Dachau only to be interned again at Buchenwald, and a Frenchman imprisoned from Alsace, who breaks down after telling of being raped and subject to inhuman torture. Their stories are indeed heart wrenching, because unlike the Jews, they have forced to live quietly, unable to share their horrific experiences for so long.It is interesting to note that the penal code didn't cover lesbians. The Nazis considered lesbians to be  ""curable."" Women were regarded, as vessels of motherhood - increasing the German population was top priority - therefore, they were exempt from mass arrest. Most lesbians went into exile or quietly married gay men. One woman, who tells her story in the film, was given exit papers and was lucky enough to escape to England.The statistics are staggering: Between 1933 and 1945, some 100,000 men were arrested for homosexuality, roughly half of them were sentenced to prison, and from 10,000 to 15,000 were sent to concentration camps. The camps were used for re-education, slave labor, castration and sadistic medical experiments. It's believed only about 4,000 survived their ordeal.The situation didn't improve after the war. Paragraph 175 remained in force until the late sixties, so many gay men were re-imprisoned and subject to repeated persecution. In this respect, Epstein and Friedman should be largely commended for bringing this subject to the attention of the world, and telling these powerful personal stories before the last survivors die.

690810,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B00005YUP1,Anyechka,"[6, 6]","This documentary covers an aspect of the Shoah that isn't well-covered in a lot of the massive literature and films on the topic, the persecution of gay men (most of them from German Christian families) under the Nazi regime.  I agree it is a refreshing change of pace to listen to the stories of the people who were among one of the other persecuted groups, even though the Jews of Europe were the primary and by far the greatest casualties.  Of the hundred thousand or so gay men arrested and sent to concentration-camps, fewer than ten were known to have been alive at the time this documentary was made, and three of the survivors declined to be interviewed, for reasons that are explained during the audio commentary.  Lesbianism wasn't considered a crime under Paragraph 175 and was viewed as a temporary treatable condition, but a handful of lesbians were also arrested or persecuted.  This documentary also brings us the story of one lesbian Jewish woman, who was lucky enough to be able to leave Germany for England pretty early on, before things got much worse.  And unlike the other survivors of the Shoah, these people were told to keep quiet for decades, not encouraged to tell their stories, not even after 30 or 40 years had passed.  They have also never been recognised by the German government as having been Nazi victims, and indeed some, after all they had already been through, were once again arrested under Paragraph 175 in the Fifties and Sixties.This provides a good general historical overview, as well as telling, poignant, and sensitive remembrances from the people who actually lived through the liberated days of the Weimar Republic and the Nazi repression and horror that followed, although given the age of most of the participants, it's understandable that these interviews aren't incredibly long, and that a lot of things remain unsaid.  It seems really unfair to fault the documentary for this reason, since these people were incredibly brave to have survived and then consented decades later to reopen the pain and finally share their stories, but it just feels like it's lacking some substance.  Maybe if the film had been a little longer, it would have felt more structured, tighter, even more informative and powerful.  The audio commentary does add a little to the film, mostly talking about how they came to take on this project and their experiences filming it, such as how one of the oldest survivors, Heinz (whom they reported had died since the film was shot), had originally wanted to be shown in silhouette but decided against it for vanity reasons when shown the sample image of how he would look, as well as figuring he didn't have that much longer to live and that it wouldn't be such a big deal after all for people to see his face.  (And as the commentators pointed out, it would have been a shame if he had gone through with the silhouette idea, since he had such beautiful eyes.)  There are also two additional interviews with survivors, as well as some information about New York Films, the company that made this film, along with some movie trailers for some of their other films.  And a word of warning--you have to turn the subtitles on yourself; they don't come on automatically as they do in some other films with a lot of foreign dialogue.  For some reason, the letter ""I"" was always capitalised in the subtitles, as in, for example, ""Today, It's hard to Imagine..."" and ""We dId the other thIng too, of course.""",4,A good introduction to the subject,1129593600,"10 18, 2005",2005,3471,"['documentary', 'aspect', 'Shoah', ""n't"", 'well-covered', 'lot', 'massive', 'literature', 'films', 'topic', 'persecution', 'gay', 'men', 'most', 'German', 'Christian', 'families', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'agree', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace', 'listen', 'stories', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'one', 'other', 'persecuted', 'groups', 'even', 'Jews', 'Europe', 'were', 'primary', 'far', 'greatest', 'casualties', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'so', 'gay', 'men', 'arrested', 'sent', 'concentration-camps', 'fewer', 'ten', 'were', 'known', 'have', 'been', 'alive', 'time', 'documentary', 'was', 'made', 'three', 'survivors', 'declined', 'be', 'interviewed', 'reasons', 'are', 'explained', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Lesbianism', 'was', ""n't"", 'considered', 'crime', 'Paragraph', '175', 'was', 'viewed', 'temporary', 'treatable', 'condition', 'handful', 'lesbians', 'were', 'also', 'arrested', 'persecuted', 'documentary', 'also', 'story', 'one', 'lesbian', 'Jewish', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'be', 'able', 'leave', 'Germany', 'England', 'pretty', 'early', 'things', 'got', 'much', 'worse', 'other', 'survivors', 'Shoah', 'people', 'were', 'told', 'keep', 'quiet', 'decades', 'not', 'encouraged', 'tell', 'stories', 'not', 'even', '30', '40', 'years', 'had', 'passed', 'have', 'also', 'never', 'been', 'recognised', 'German', 'government', 'having', 'been', 'Nazi', 'victims', 'indeed', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'were', 'once', 'again', 'arrested', 'Paragraph', '175', 'Fifties', 'Sixties.This', 'good', 'general', 'historical', 'overview', 'as', 'well', 'telling', 'poignant', 'sensitive', 'remembrances', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'lived', 'liberated', 'days', 'Weimar', 'Republic', 'Nazi', 'repression', 'horror', 'followed', 'given', 'age', 'most', 'participants', 'understandable', 'interviews', 'are', ""n't"", 'incredibly', 'long', 'lot', 'things', 'remain', 'unsaid', 'really', 'unfair', 'fault', 'documentary', 'reason', 'people', 'were', 'incredibly', 'brave', 'have', 'survived', 'then', 'consented', 'decades', 'later', 'reopen', 'pain', 'finally', 'share', 'stories', 'just', 'feels', 'lacking', 'substance', 'Maybe', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'longer', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'more', 'structured', 'tighter', 'even', 'more', 'informative', 'powerful', 'audio', 'commentary', 'add', 'little', 'film', 'mostly', 'talking', 'how', 'came', 'take', 'project', 'experiences', 'filming', 'such', 'how', 'one', 'oldest', 'survivors', 'Heinz', 'whom', 'reported', 'had', 'died', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'had', 'originally', 'wanted', 'be', 'shown', 'silhouette', 'decided', 'vanity', 'reasons', 'when', 'shown', 'sample', 'image', 'how', 'would', 'look', 'as', 'well', 'figuring', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'longer', 'live', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'such', 'big', 'deal', 'people', 'see', 'face', 'commentators', 'pointed', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'shame', 'had', 'gone', 'silhouette', 'idea', 'had', 'such', 'beautiful', 'eyes', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'additional', 'interviews', 'survivors', 'as', 'well', 'information', 'New', 'York', 'Films', 'company', 'made', 'film', 'movie', 'trailers', 'other', 'films', 'word', 'warning', 'have', 'turn', 'subtitles', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'automatically', 'do', 'other', 'films', 'lot', 'foreign', 'dialogue', 'reason', 'letter', 'was', 'always', 'capitalised', 'subtitles', 'example', 'Today', 'hard', 'Imagine', 'dId', 'other', 'thIng', 'too', 'course']",N/A

Many of the interviews are touching and tragic, though at times the movie fragments them a bit more than is necessary.My main criticism of the movie is that it sometimes blurs the lines between homosexuality and pedophilia.  Some of the interviewees state outright that sex between adult men and boys was a healthy and even wonderful part of homosexuality in pre-war Germany.  One interviewee in particular waxes eloquent about having himself ""seduced"" an adult man when he was but a young boy - as if an adult who lets himself ""be seduced"" by a child is somehow not a pedophile!  This is sick and needs to be labeled as such, which the movie fails to do.  And more so, it does gay people a terrible injustice because it perpetuates some of the most vile stereotypes about homosexuality.On the flip side, none of the men interviewed spoke of having themselves molested boys, but considering the positive attitude expressed toward pedophilia, I couldn't help but imagine what some, knowing the potential criminal consequences of such an admission, were leaving out of their tales...",4,"Excellent movie, minus the positive references to pedophilia",1166227200,"12 16, 2006",2006,1247,"['movie', 'key', 'testament', 'one', 'largely', 'unspoken', 'aspect', 'Holocaust', 'horrors', 'perpetrated', 'Nazis', 'gay', 'men', 'lesser', 'degree', 'lesbians', 'Many', 'interviews', 'are', 'touching', 'tragic', 'though', 'times', 'movie', 'bit', 'more', 'necessary.My', 'main', 'criticism', 'movie', 'lines', 'homosexuality', 'pedophilia', 'interviewees', 'state', 'outright', 'sex', 'adult', 'men', 'boys', 'was', 'healthy', 'even', 'wonderful', 'part', 'homosexuality', 'pre-war', 'Germany', 'One', 'interviewee', 'particular', 'waxes', 'eloquent', 'having', 'seduced', 'adult', 'man', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'adult', 'who', 'be', 'seduced', 'child', 'somehow', 'not', 'pedophile', 'sick', 'be', 'labeled', 'such', 'movie', 'do', 'more', 'so', 'gay', 'people', 'terrible', 'injustice', 'most', 'vile', 'stereotypes', 'flip', 'side', 'none', 'men', 'interviewed', 'spoke', 'having', 'molested', 'boys', 'considering', 'positive', 'attitude', 'expressed', 'pedophilia', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'imagine', 'what', 'knowing', 'potential', 'criminal', 'consequences', 'such', 'admission', 'were', 'leaving', 'tales']",N/A

The poorly documented terror aimed at gay men in Nazi-era Germany is examined in this very important and moving film.Of those who survived, few were still living by the time Epstein made this document, and it represents a number of things - one of many eloquent reminders of human atrocities we should never be allowed to forget (and we should never allow the history to be forgotten), and a specific reminder to younger generations of gay and lesbian individuals around the globe of why we must always remain aware, attuned to our communities, and willing to fight when needed.This is really an almost flawless film - I do have one small complaint.  As with Michael Apted's MOVING THE MOUNTAIN (a reunion of the student leaders of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement), Epstein allows his camera to linger upon the tears of individuals who are reliving some extremel painful memories, a tactic I have some issues with, as I find it (at the very least) to be a little invasive, and in a film as strong (and valuable) as this one is, it's a tactical misstep.This minor gripe aside, this is one of the more historically important documentaries to appear in recent years.

690814,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00005YUP1,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[10, 10]","The German Penal Code of 1871, Paragraph 175, states ""An unnatural sex act committed between persons of the male sex or by humans with animals is punishable by imprisonment; the loss of civil rights may also be imposed.""  The law was widely disregarded, and the post-World War I Weimar Republic saw a flowering of gay and lesbian culture, most particularly in Berlin.  When the Weimar Republic collapsed and the Nazi party rose to power, few gays and lesbians felt any reason to fear: was not Ernst Rohm, head of the SA, well known for his homosexuality?On 1 July 1934, later known as ""The Night of Long Knives,"" the Nazi party conducted a bloody purge of their ranks.  Rohm was among the victims, and as the Nazis swept to full power over Germany they moved to broaden the scope of Paragraph 175.  The glory days of gay and lesbian Berlin were over.  Somewhat oddly, lesbians were not regarded as a threat to the Nazi party, and many lesbians either left Germany or simply withdrew from public life, thus escaping with their lives.  Gay men, however, came under full attack.  A special branch of the Gestapo was formed to identify gay men; once their lists were established the arrests began.With many records destroyed by the Nazis as the Allies swept through Europe at the close of the war, it is now very difficult to estimate how many homosexuals were arrested.  Most historians agree there is hard evidence to support a figure of 100,000, but many note that the total may have been well in excess of that, possibly to the extent of 600,000 total.  Of those fed into the Nazi meat grinder, perhaps 4,000 survived--a much lower survival rate than that found even among political prisoners.  There is considerable evidence that homosexuals were regarded as the ""lowest of the low"" in the prison pecking order and suffered not only from Nazi atrocity but were also sometimes savaged by their fellow prisoners as well.  And to them was given a final curse: the victorious Allies retained Paragraph 175 as law following the collapse of Nazi Germany.  Fearing possible re-arrest at Allied hands, homosexuals who survived the prisons and concentration camps dare not speak of their lives and experiences.  Most would remain silent until their deaths.The documentary PARAGRAPH 175 does not attempt to examine the full scope of Nazi atrocity or even Nazi atrocity against the gay community.  It instead focuses on the memories of a handful of men and women who recall their experiences.  Perhaps the single most famous of these is Pierre Seel, who saw his lover killed by dogs in the death camps and who closeted himself to a remarkable extent after the war.  ""I am ashamed!"" Seel cries at one point in his series of interviews.  ""I am ashamed for humanity!""  It is a memorable moment of pain echoing across the decades.  Seel died in 2005.While most of the interview subjects are male, lesbians are represented by Annette Eick, a remarkably charming woman, and while their stories vary considerably in detail they are the same in content: I was there, I saw it, and I bear witness for those who cannot speak.  At times the film seems excessively languid, but overall it does justice to its interview subjects, who emerge as fully-depicted individuals, sometimes passionate, sometimes restrained, but never without the dignity that should belong to all mankind as birthright.The DVD contains several extras.  Although it contained several points of interest I was not greatly impressed with the audio commentary; on the other hand, I was greatly impressed with two bonus interviews and particularly so by subject Kitty Fisher, a Jewish woman who recounts how a homosexual prisoner came to her aid--and whose advice ultimately saved her life.These are painful memories, all of them, and all the more so because the Holocaust has been increasingly downplayed over the past few decades--downplayed to a point at which some few now attempt to deny that it ever occurred at all.  But facts remain facts no matter how many misguided people attempt to change or refute them, and in the name of humanity itself we owe all those who have suffered in the killing fields of the world the dignity of truth.

The film's makers instead opt for the more sensitive approach of interviewing the few remaining men (and one woman)who survived the period.  From these elderly gentlemen we hear memories of how fun Berlin was from 1914 to 1918, the between war period when life was raucous and liberated.  We then learn through their words and through film clips of the growing influence of Hitler and his own gay SA General, the response of  a people wilted from WWI needing hope for a future and not realizing the depravity of the promises of the Nazi party, the ugly truth.

This movie reflects the ""Identity Politics"" so popular among the Liberal/Left. Unfortunately, this sort of overt political agenda which chokes scholarship and destroys rational dialogue about what same sex love is all about.Truth is the Nazi Party was anti-Christian, attacked Judeo-Christian sexual norms in favor of a twisted form of paganism. In this atmosphere of anti-religion, homosexuality was not only tolerated, but was widely practiced by many top Party leaders and members.The book doesn't really explore the history of notorious homosexual Ernst Rohlm who was the head of the SA. No mention of the long tradition of homosexuality among the German aristocracy and the military. No mention of the Vandervogel Movement, or Adolph Brand and his publication Der Eigene, which celebrated same sex love in the ""Greek"" tradition. Amazingly, the strongest evidence for widespread homosexual practices among the Nazi Party was SA leader Henrich Himmler himself, who detailed these accusations in his famous speech to the SA Leadership in 1936 in which he demanded a purge of these behaviors from the SS. Adolph Hitler himself was the subject of much suspicion of engaging in same sex relationships in his youth.Nothing about any of this is mentioned in this so-called ""documentary"". Truth is that same sex love in Central Europe followed the historical model of Ancient ""Greek Love"" and Japanese ""nanshoku"". Same sex physical and emotionaly intimacy in Germany and Central Europe was practiced by those with the social or economic position to be able to ignore prevailing sexual norms: the aristocracy, urban sophisticates, intellectuals, and certain elements of the military. Personally, I believe that the resentment of some many people of power bribing or corrupting working class young men and boys into sexual activity is the root of much middle class and working class bias toward same sex love that even continues to the modern era.Even the name of the movie is misleading. In fact, it was ""Paragraph 175-A"" passed in the 1935 which was the problem. In 1935, the original Paragraph 175--which dated back to 1871--was modified to criminalize any type of behavior that could be interpreted as indicating a homosexual inclination or desire. Under the expanded defination of illegal behavior under Paragraph ""175A"", the Nazi Party was provided a very powerful political weapon to get rid of their enemies. Under the new defination all sorts of perfectly non-sexual intimacy could be construed as criminal behavior. While there is no doubt many gay men were persecuted by the Nazi Party, there is contradictory evidence that Gay men continued to serve in the military, the government and the Nazi Party, as long as they were socially discrete and politically reliable.Contrary to this movie's message, the documented incidence of gay men among the concentration camps population was so tiny a fraction of the number of practicing gays that we might expect from a geographic area as large as Germany that there may be doubt that there was a Gay ""holocaust"" in the sense of the term as applied to Jews, the physically or mentally disabled, or certain other ethnic groups such as Gypsies. And no doubt, many so-called gay ""victims"" in the concentration camps were in fact not gay at all, but were merely opponents of the regime or personal enemies of influential citizens.True students of gay history and culture will find a lot of problems with this movie.",1,"Half a history, not the truth about Nazism and Gays....",1167523200,"12 31, 2006",2006,3635,"['flick', 'made', 'politically', 'left-wing', 'liberals', 'gays', 'other', 'politically', 'liberal', 'leftist', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'who', 'want', 'rationalizations', 'political', 'beliefs', 'movie', 'Identity', 'Politics', 'so', 'popular', 'Liberal/Left', 'Unfortunately', 'sort', 'overt', 'political', 'agenda', 'scholarship', 'rational', 'dialogue', 'what', 'same', 'sex', 'love', 'about.Truth', 'Nazi', 'Party', 'was', 'anti-Christian', 'attacked', 'Judeo-Christian', 'sexual', 'norms', 'favor', 'twisted', 'form', 'paganism', 'atmosphere', 'anti-religion', 'homosexuality', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'tolerated', 'was', 'widely', 'practiced', 'many', 'top', 'Party', 'leaders', 'members.The', 'book', ""n't"", 'really', 'explore', 'history', 'notorious', 'homosexual', 'Ernst', 'Rohlm', 'who', 'was', 'head', 'SA', 'mention', 'long', 'tradition', 'homosexuality', 'German', 'aristocracy', 'military', 'mention', 'Vandervogel', 'Movement', 'Adolph', 'Brand', 'publication', 'Der', 'Eigene', 'celebrated', 'same', 'sex', 'love', 'Greek', 'tradition', 'Amazingly', 'strongest', 'evidence', 'widespread', 'homosexual', 'practices', 'Nazi', 'Party', 'was', 'SA', 'leader', 'Henrich', 'Himmler', 'who', 'detailed', 'accusations', 'famous', 'speech', 'SA', 'Leadership', '1936', 'demanded', 'purge', 'behaviors', 'SS', 'Adolph', 'Hitler', 'was', 'subject', 'much', 'suspicion', 'engaging', 'same', 'sex', 'relationships', 'youth.Nothing', 'mentioned', 'so-called', 'documentary', 'Truth', 'same', 'sex', 'love', 'Central', 'Europe', 'followed', 'historical', 'model', 'Ancient', 'Greek', 'Love', 'Japanese', 'nanshoku', 'Same', 'sex', 'physical', 'emotionaly', 'intimacy', 'Germany', 'Central', 'Europe', 'was', 'practiced', 'social', 'economic', 'position', 'be', 'able', 'ignore', 'prevailing', 'sexual', 'norms', 'aristocracy', 'urban', 'sophisticates', 'intellectuals', 'certain', 'elements', 'military', 'Personally', 'believe', 'resentment', 'many', 'people', 'power', 'bribing', 'corrupting', 'working', 'class', 'young', 'men', 'boys', 'sexual', 'activity', 'root', 'much', 'middle', 'class', 'working', 'class', 'bias', 'same', 'sex', 'love', 'even', 'modern', 'name', 'movie', 'misleading', 'fact', 'was', 'Paragraph', '175-A', 'passed', '1935', 'was', 'problem', '1935', 'original', 'Paragraph', '175', 'dated', 'back', '1871', 'was', 'modified', 'criminalize', 'type', 'behavior', 'could', 'be', 'interpreted', 'indicating', 'homosexual', 'inclination', 'desire', 'expanded', 'defination', 'illegal', 'behavior', 'Paragraph', '175A', 'Nazi', 'Party', 'was', 'provided', 'very', 'powerful', 'political', 'weapon', 'get', 'rid', 'enemies', 'new', 'defination', 'sorts', 'perfectly', 'non-sexual', 'intimacy', 'could', 'be', 'construed', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'doubt', 'many', 'gay', 'men', 'were', 'persecuted', 'Nazi', 'Party', 'contradictory', 'evidence', 'Gay', 'men', 'continued', 'serve', 'military', 'government', 'Nazi', 'Party', 'as', 'long', 'were', 'socially', 'discrete', 'politically', 'reliable.Contrary', 'movie', 'message', 'documented', 'incidence', 'gay', 'men', 'concentration', 'camps', 'population', 'was', 'so', 'tiny', 'fraction', 'number', 'practicing', 'gays', 'might', 'expect', 'geographic', 'area', 'as', 'large', 'Germany', 'may', 'be', 'doubt', 'was', 'Gay', 'holocaust', 'sense', 'term', 'applied', 'Jews', 'physically', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'certain', 'other', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'such', 'Gypsies', 'doubt', 'many', 'so-called', 'gay', 'victims', 'concentration', 'camps', 'were', 'fact', 'not', 'gay', 'were', 'merely', 'opponents', 'regime', 'personal', 'enemies', 'influential', 'citizens.True', 'students', 'gay', 'history', 'culture', 'will', 'find', 'lot', 'problems', 'movie']",N/A

In fact, one of the best things about this documentary is that it is not a slick, clean production, with all of the extra things edited out. It's rough, to allow us to see their humanity.

Michael Click,"[20, 21]","From the Oscar-winning producers of ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" (Best Documentary Feature, 1984) and ""Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt"" (Best Documentary Feature, 1989) comes this exquisitely composed film about the persecution of homosexuals by the Nazis during the Third Reich.  Narrated by Rupert Everett, the film combines archival footage and photographs with recent interviews with a handful of gay survivors who were still living at the end of the 20th century.  What emerges is a stunning, emotionally raw portrait of individuals who were thrown into a living hell only to crawl back out into a world where their perceptions of humanity - and self - would never be fully healed.  This is a film with moments both heartbreaking (a man in his mid-ninties tells that his mother never asked even one question about his lengthy internment, and confides his unfilled yearning to talk with his father), and mind-numbing (another survivor describes the horrific meaning of the place known as the ""singing forest"").  One of the few works to explore the Nazi persecution of gays (along with the play and film ""Bent"", the books ""The Pink Triangle"" and ""The Men with the Pink Triangles"", etc.), ""Paragraph 175"" is by far the best at personalizing this incomprehensible chapter in gay history, and is a definite ""must-see"".The DVD edition is highly recommended.  In addition to the film, it includes the original theatrical trailer, and two bonus interviews from the Shoah Foundation featuring non-homosexuals offering their personal accounts of how gay men were treated in the concentration camps.

It is made clear throughout the documentary how extraordinarily difficult it was to get the extremely elderly men who were the survivors of the Holocaust to think back to what must have been a horrifying period in their lives.  The producers managed to get through, however, sometimes with the help of friends, sometimes on their own, and the effect is a devastating one.  I cannot agree with the reviewer from Louisiana who carped about ""too many Nazi movies"".  First of all, the Holocaust is a horror which must never be forgotten, and there is no point at which there will be too much information about a ""civilized"" Western European country which slaughtered millions upon millions upon millions of people at a time which is still in the living memory of countless Europeans, Americans and other citizens of the world.  Second, I would have a hard time in coming up with any short list, let alone long list of written, audio or video material which treats the specific subject of the extermination of gay people in Hitler's camps. Gay men were one of the secondary groups of slaughter, of course, in comparison to the breathtaking horror that was visited upon the Jews, but they were a major group nevertheless, and if the critic in Louisiana thinks that this is a story that does not need telling, then I'm sorry, but he's wrong.  It does need telling, and the point to this documentary is that not many more years will pass before all of those who survived the terror are gone, gone, gone.  The fact that the Holocaust is a throbbing and living thing even in the lives of people in the late 20th and early 21st century was neatly encapsulated in ""Paragraph 175"" when, if I understood it correctly, a French interviewee said that the interview was the first time that he had ever spoken to a German since World War II.  ""Paragraph 175"" brought tears to my eyes again and again, because I had to ask, again and again, ""why, why in God's name, why?""  Whether Nazi atrocities have been treated in the media to a greater, lesser, more significant or any other extent than the atrocities of Stalin's Gulag (and as a Latvian, I am perfectly aware of what Stalin did, thank you) is entirely not the point.

690823,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005YUP1,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[5, 6]","Homosexuality still raises heated debates, as the homosexual community is struggling for equal rights.  Despite contemporary and historical lessons this issue continues to lead to hate crimes in our modern-day and enlightened society.  Some still believe that homosexuality is a disease or disorder that can be treated while the American Psychology Association discards this notion.  Yet, the stigma remains, as it often is fueled with heated emotions that often rest within people's values and morals.  This stigma seems to have divided people into two camps with different opinions; only time and wisdom will help the people in both camps come together.The documentary, Paragraph 175, is depicted through several archive film clips, which are complemented with several interviews with the few who are still alive when the film was shot.  Through these interviews the audience can see the emotion that the survivors display and hear the horrors that they experienced through their trembling voices.  The documentary does not disclose much of what happened, but their faces and voices tell more than a thousand words.  Shame, anger, and sadness are intertwined in the emotions that are expressed through the interviewees, as they try to tell their story that not many have thought was important during the last 50 years.The years after World War I was the beginning allowed for a good life for gay men and women in Germany, especially in Berlin, where the gay community blossomed.  It was a time when the gay community could live relatively open despite the law of Paragraph 175, which dated back to 1871.  Paragraph 175 stated, ""An unnatural sex act committed between persons of the male sex or by humans with animals is punishable by imprisonment; the loss of civil rights may also be imposed.""  The existence of Paragraph 175 left the gay community in danger to extortion and imprisonment.  Thus, arose a movement led by Dr. Magnus Hirschfled that attempted to remove this law and help erase some of the stigma in regards to homosexuality.  The movement gained a large number of followers, as it seemed that freedom was about to take another historical step forward.The rise of the Nazi regime in Germany initially seemed to be safe for gay men and women, as Hitler's leader for the storm troops was Ernst R&ouml;hm, who was known to be gay.  However, several people tauntingly criticized R&ouml;hm and the Nazi government.  Some went as far as suggesting that the Nazi leaders were all homosexuals. In retrospect, it has been told that Hitler had made a deal with the German military leaders, which entailed that Hitler had to get rid of R&ouml;hm, who was considered an embarrassment, if he wanted the German chancellor position.  It led to the Night of the Long Knives when R&ouml;hm was executed without a trial, as Hitler informed the people that R&ouml;hm and some others were planning a coup.  It also caused Hitler to enforce Paragraph 175, which was also rewritten a year after R&ouml;hm's death.Darkness and shadow spread quickly around Germany, as the majority of Germany supported Hitler as the new German chancellor.  Maybe, this notion could serve as an opportunity to show that a misguided public majority can be very dangerous.  In fact, a month after Hitler was in power he order gay meeting places to be closed, which shortly after was followed by the torching of the Reichstag, the German legislative building.  Chaos ruled in Germany, as Hitler methodically used the chaos to gain emergency powers from the government.  Sanctioned to use force, Hitler began to increase the persecution of Jews and made the Nazi party the only legal party within a six-month span.Amidst the hatred and the persecution of Jews, homosexuals thought that they were protected by their German heritage.  However, many found that their German ethnicity did not protect them, as many were sent off to prison and labor camps while many were also sent to concentration camps.  They were forced to wear pink triangles, which marked them as homosexuals.  Lesbians were luckier as a decision was made in the Nazi government that women were more important, as they could bare children and help provide a strong nation.  Nonetheless, a few lesbians were sent to concentration camps, but their number cannot even compare to the number of gay men that were imprisoned.  The reason was that male homosexuality was treated as a contagious disease and female homosexuality was treated more like a short-termed condition.After the war the Allies did not recognize the gay survivors as they were simply swept aside.  The German's continued to enforce the Nazi version of Paragraph 175 until 1967.  The shadow of the emotional damage and stigma that the Nazi regime created still affects people today.  This stigma might have affected the low number of survivors that have stepped forward for recognition of their suffering.  Only ten known survivors existed when this documentary was shot.  The year after the documentary was released the German and Swiss Bank compensation program for survivors began to include gay victims, which was in 2001.",5,Nazi's Socialized Stigma - An Important &

690824,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005YUP1,Lawyeraau,"[1, 1]","This is a beautifully executed documentary that is approached with great sensitivity. An official selection of the 2000 Sundance Film Festival, the film is named after Paragraph 175, Germany's anti-sodomy law, which was enacted in 1871 and was gender specific to males. It is this statute upon which the Nazi regime relied to round up homosexual men for internment in its infamous concentration camps. Once interned, they were reduced to wearing the now infamous ""pink triangle"" to herald their homosexuality.This documentary focuses on poignant reminiscences by the handful of homosexual men, now in their eighties and nineties, as well as one elderly lesbian who had managed to escape from Germany to England, who survived their experiences, were still alive at the time of filming, and willing to talk about this painful time in their lives. Their stories, sensitively handled by interviewer and historian Klaus Muller, are coupled with wonderful archival footage of a Germany of long ago, and come to life under the expert hands of directors Jerry Friedman and Rob Epstein.The film discusses Weimar Germany's tolerance of homosexuality in the post World War I era, which tolerance continued up until the time the Nazis took control of the country. Berlin was a mecca for homosexuals before the Nazis took over, and Paragraph 175 was largely ignored. The film is highly successful in capturing the joie de vivre of that era, with wonderful archival film footage, stills, and music of a pre-Adolph Hitler Berlin, interspersed with clips of Marlene Dietrich in the film ""The Blue Angel"" (1931). The use of that film, as well as its signature song ""Falling In Love Again"", is a perfect marriage with this documentary, as it captures the flavor of the Weimar Republic before Adolph Hitler cast his shadow upon it.The film shows how the Nazi regime stealthily encroached upon the tolerance that had been so pervasive, rendering gay Berlin a thing of the past, no longer a mecca for homosexuals. Its rigid application of Paragraph 175 was the end of an era of tolerance. It was replaced by the persecution of and intolerance for Germany's homosexual men. The film, narrated by Rupert Everett, is a brief ode to the suffering of this segment of Germany's population, but it is, nonetheless, a powerful one.The DVD is limited in terms of bonus features. It does, however, provide two additional interviews with concentration camp survivors who shed more light on the treatment of homosexuals during the Nazi era, as well as an insightful and intelligent film commentary by the directors and producer.",4,THE BASHING OF GAY MEN BY THE NAZI REGIME...,1148774400,"05 28, 2006",2006,2595,"['beautifully', 'executed', 'documentary', 'approached', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'official', 'selection', '2000', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'film', 'named', 'Paragraph', '175', 'Germany', 'anti-sodomy', 'law', 'was', 'enacted', '1871', 'was', 'gender', 'specific', 'males', 'statute', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'relied', 'round', 'up', 'homosexual', 'men', 'internment', 'infamous', 'concentration', 'camps', 'Once', 'interned', 'were', 'reduced', 'wearing', 'now', 'infamous', 'pink', 'triangle', 'herald', 'homosexuality.This', 'documentary', 'focuses', 'poignant', 'reminiscences', 'handful', 'homosexual', 'men', 'now', 'eighties', 'nineties', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'elderly', 'lesbian', 'who', 'had', 'managed', 'escape', 'Germany', 'England', 'who', 'survived', 'experiences', 'were', 'still', 'alive', 'time', 'filming', 'willing', 'talk', 'painful', 'time', 'lives', 'stories', 'sensitively', 'handled', 'interviewer', 'historian', 'Klaus', 'Muller', 'are', 'coupled', 'wonderful', 'archival', 'footage', 'Germany', 'long', 'ago', 'come', 'life', 'expert', 'hands', 'directors', 'Jerry', 'Friedman', 'Rob', 'Epstein.The', 'film', 'discusses', 'Weimar', 'Germany', 'tolerance', 'homosexuality', 'post', 'World', 'War', 'era', 'tolerance', 'continued', 'up', 'time', 'Nazis', 'took', 'control', 'country', 'Berlin', 'was', 'mecca', 'homosexuals', 'Nazis', 'took', 'over', 'Paragraph', '175', 'was', 'largely', 'ignored', 'film', 'highly', 'successful', 'capturing', 'joie', 'vivre', 'era', 'wonderful', 'archival', 'film', 'footage', 'stills', 'music', 'pre-Adolph', 'Hitler', 'Berlin', 'interspersed', 'clips', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'film', 'Blue', 'Angel', '1931', 'use', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'signature', 'song', 'Falling', 'Love', 'Again', 'perfect', 'marriage', 'documentary', 'flavor', 'Weimar', 'Republic', 'Adolph', 'Hitler', 'cast', 'shadow', 'it.The', 'film', 'how', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'stealthily', 'encroached', 'tolerance', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'pervasive', 'rendering', 'gay', 'Berlin', 'thing', 'past', 'no', 'longer', 'mecca', 'homosexuals', 'rigid', 'application', 'Paragraph', '175', 'was', 'end', 'era', 'tolerance', 'was', 'replaced', 'persecution', 'intolerance', 'Germany', 'homosexual', 'men', 'film', 'narrated', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'brief', 'ode', 'suffering', 'segment', 'Germany', 'population', 'nonetheless', 'powerful', 'one.The', 'DVD', 'limited', 'terms', 'bonus', 'features', 'however', 'provide', 'two', 'additional', 'interviews', 'concentration', 'camp', 'survivors', 'who', 'shed', 'more', 'light', 'treatment', 'homosexuals', 'Nazi', 'era', 'as', 'well', 'insightful', 'intelligent', 'film', 'commentary', 'directors', 'producer']",N/A

While Jewish people were the primary target of Nazi Germany, homosexuals were also discriminated against in the worst way. However, while this documentary is informative, it seems like it is a one hour film stretched into 90 minutes.The most annoying aspect of the film is its moments of long pauses in narration. Since it primarily concerns itself with interviews of homosexuals who survived imprisonment in concentration camps, it&#65533;s understandable that the survivors have long pauses. After all, they&#65533;re elderly and the pain the memories bring can make it hard to speak. But the long pauses continue when Rupert Everet does his narration as well. And they're not dramatic pauses, but pauses to fit the length of video provided. The narration either needed more material, or the film needed to condense its video.Also, as the film jumps back and forth between survivors, it never seems to have any real focus. One interviewee will be talking about one thing, and then it switches to another discussing some other topic. Though the film makes some good points and does serve to be enlightening, it's apparent that it could have done a better job in telling the stories. As it is, it seems like a rough cut of the documentary, not the final film.Despite my criticisms, Paragraph 175 still has some interesting stories to tell and some moments of true poignancy and sorrow.
