It's an effective close, though biblically, its concept cannot possibly be correct.The bible clearly indicates that the antichrist has power of the surviving christians.  Nowhere does it even suggest that David will be able to use computers to launch an electronic counter-attack.But that's the point of this film.  Opening in the critically unexplained wake of a nuclear attack from Russia (which now lacks the power to be the force it is in this global worldview,) allowing David to be rescued by double-agent Connie, who is one of the most interesting characters in the films.Picking up a scientist, her daughter (who tries, badly, to emulate Blaire from the ""Facts of life), and a young man disfigured by the nuclear waste left in the world.  A doomsday person.This film is the ultimate road trip movie, actually.  Only a group on the run would dare to drive through a midwest that is totally devastated by nuclear war, and only for the strongest reaons would they be chased during such a condition.I must argue the point, however.  This film somehow feels off.

717809,A3USRUCHAOC3MT,B00006JDTP,"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff""","[0, 0]","The first three movies in the ""Thief In The Night"" series kept getting better.  But then they released this hurried fourth installment, which was the worst of the group.I get the impression that the movie was made so they could finish the story, not because there was a real need for another installment.  It in fact was designed to be shown in two parts.  The first part had a summary of the first three movies (which was not true with the second and third of the series), and the second part reviewed the first part.Add to this that the special effects were not that special.  True, I watched this the same day I saw ""Return Of The Jedi"", so it had a lot to live up to.  But there was one scene at the end that obviously was a minature -- it did not look real.Allow me to say, though, that this movie wasn't without entertainment value.  There was an effective mystery on who was tipping the bad guys about the protagonists' whereabouts.  There was an introduction to ""The Doomsday People"", who had been burned somehow.  There was some humor, as with the other movies as well.  But it paled when compared to the first three movies.",4,They Should Have Quit While They Were Ahead.,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,1133,"['first', 'three', 'movies', 'Thief', 'Night', 'series', 'kept', 'getting', 'better', 'then', 'released', 'hurried', 'fourth', 'installment', 'was', 'worst', 'group.I', 'get', 'impression', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'could', 'finish', 'story', 'not', 'was', 'real', 'need', 'installment', 'fact', 'was', 'designed', 'be', 'shown', 'two', 'parts', 'first', 'part', 'had', 'summary', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'was', 'not', 'true', 'second', 'third', 'series', 'second', 'part', 'reviewed', 'first', 'part.Add', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'not', 'special', 'True', 'watched', 'same', 'day', 'saw', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'had', 'lot', 'live', 'up', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'end', 'obviously', 'was', 'minature', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'real.Allow', 'say', 'though', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'entertainment', 'value', 'was', 'effective', 'mystery', 'who', 'was', 'tipping', 'bad', 'guys', 'protagonists', 'whereabouts', 'was', 'introduction', 'Doomsday', 'People', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'burned', 'somehow', 'was', 'humor', 'other', 'movies', 'well', 'paled', 'when', 'compared', 'first', 'three', 'movies']",N/A

717811,A32AJO8JPEHBIA,B00006JDTP,mak1457,"[2, 2]","I was less than impressed when I first watched this movie 8 years ago. I came back to this movie after a long absence hoping time would change my mind about this venerable movie. It has.First of all, the fact that it's on DVD now helps tremendously. The movie itself is good but the extras help fill in some questions. The commentary on the movie was interesting (did you know that one of the scenes cost more to film than the entire original movie?). It was also interesting looking at Thom and Maryann Rachford (aka, Jerry and Dianne) after 30 years. While Jerry's chops have disappeared Dianne still sports the long hair.But now onto the movie. The salvation message is still clear although there is considerably more plot than the first two movies. The music is also a step up from the first three films. The scenes with the Doomsday people could actually be quite scary, especially when you add the music. Although some might find the storyline redundant, it does sort of remind you of an Indiana Jones-type movie. I'm not sure why so many people complain about this movie - it lines up with No. 3 as the best in the series in my opinionAlthough this is the least well-known film in the series, this is still worth your time to watch it.",4,Great movie to watch,1153612800,"07 23, 2006",2006,1242,"['was', 'less', 'impressed', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'movie', '8', 'years', 'ago', 'came', 'back', 'movie', 'long', 'absence', 'hoping', 'time', 'would', 'change', 'mind', 'venerable', 'movie', 'has.First', 'fact', 'DVD', 'now', 'tremendously', 'movie', 'good', 'extras', 'help', 'fill', 'questions', 'commentary', 'movie', 'was', 'interesting', 'did', 'know', 'one', 'scenes', 'cost', 'more', 'film', 'entire', 'original', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'interesting', 'looking', 'Thom', 'Maryann', 'Rachford', 'aka', 'Jerry', 'Dianne', '30', 'years', 'Jerry', 'chops', 'have', 'disappeared', 'Dianne', 'still', 'sports', 'long', 'hair.But', 'now', 'movie', 'salvation', 'message', 'still', 'clear', 'considerably', 'more', 'plot', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'music', 'also', 'step', 'up', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'scenes', 'Doomsday', 'people', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'quite', 'scary', 'especially', 'when', 'add', 'music', 'might', 'find', 'storyline', 'redundant', 'sort', 'remind', 'Indiana', 'Jones-type', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'complain', 'movie', 'lines', 'up', 'No', '3', 'best', 'series', 'least', 'well-known', 'film', 'series', 'still', 'worth', 'time', 'watch']",N/A
