554603,A2KYV0PB1MWM2J,B00004WG3C,"Alan Majeska ""Alan Majeska""","[5, 6]","""To the Manor Born"" is one of my favorite BBC comedies.  I first viewed this series on PBS in the early 1980s, shortly after it was filmed (1979-81) and recognized Penelope Keith, Lady Audrey Fforbes-Hamilton, as the same actress who played Margo Ledbetter in ""Good Neighbors.""  This show was well cast, with supporting actress Angela Thorne (Marjorie Frobisher), and Audrey's protagonist (played by Peter Bowles), Richard DeVere.I enjoy the witty dialogue and repartee between actors.  There is humor, but it is never overstated, never tacky, never vulgar.The chaste language should appeal to anyone, no matter how conservative.  Yet, the class distinctions, snobbishness (Audrey's reference to Richard, a native born Slovak turned British citizen as ""not one of us"") tells volumes about class struggles, jealousy, bitterness over changing circumstances which can apply to anyone, not only Britain in the 1980s with changing economic status, class system, etc.  Richard, a self made millionaire and owner of a grocery store chain, buys Audrey's home and grounds (The Manor) in Episode 1, and Audrey, forced to sell on her late husband's death, is broke and forced to endure someone of a lesser social class (but much greater wealth) living in her former home.The scenery is beautiful, the plots more believable than many TV shows, and overall quality very high.  I have owned this series for the past 7 years (VHS), enjoying it very much, and expect to re-watch these for more enjoyment in the future.  This is so superior to many American TV shows, and to much of what I've seen from the BBC and other British productions over the past ten years.",5,One of my favorite BBC comedies,1125705600,"09 3, 2005",2005,1648,"['Manor', 'Born', 'one', 'favorite', 'BBC', 'comedies', 'first', 'viewed', 'series', 'PBS', 'early', '1980s', 'shortly', 'was', 'filmed', '1979-81', 'recognized', 'Penelope', 'Keith', 'Lady', 'Audrey', 'Fforbes-Hamilton', 'same', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Margo', 'Ledbetter', 'Good', 'Neighbors', 'show', 'was', 'well', 'cast', 'supporting', 'actress', 'Angela', 'Thorne', 'Marjorie', 'Frobisher', 'Audrey', 'protagonist', 'played', 'Peter', 'Bowles', 'Richard', 'DeVere.I', 'enjoy', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'repartee', 'actors', 'humor', 'never', 'overstated', 'never', 'tacky', 'never', 'vulgar.The', 'chaste', 'language', 'should', 'appeal', 'anyone', 'matter', 'how', 'conservative', 'class', 'distinctions', 'snobbishness', 'Audrey', 'reference', 'Richard', 'native', 'born', 'Slovak', 'turned', 'British', 'citizen', 'not', 'one', 'volumes', 'class', 'struggles', 'jealousy', 'bitterness', 'changing', 'circumstances', 'can', 'apply', 'anyone', 'not', 'only', 'Britain', '1980s', 'changing', 'economic', 'status', 'class', 'system', 'etc', 'Richard', 'self', 'made', 'millionaire', 'owner', 'grocery', 'store', 'chain', 'Audrey', 'home', 'grounds', 'Manor', 'Episode', '1', 'Audrey', 'forced', 'sell', 'late', 'husband', 'death', 'broke', 'forced', 'endure', 'someone', 'lesser', 'social', 'class', 'much', 'greater', 'wealth', 'living', 'former', 'home.The', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'plots', 'more', 'believable', 'many', 'TV', 'shows', 'overall', 'quality', 'very', 'high', 'have', 'owned', 'series', 'past', '7', 'years', 'VHS', 'enjoying', 'very', 'much', 'expect', 're-watch', 'more', 'enjoyment', 'future', 'so', 'superior', 'many', 'American', 'TV', 'shows', 'much', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'BBC', 'other', 'British', 'productions', 'past', 'ten', 'years']",To the Manor Born - Gift Set VHS
554604,A12KDW2EB3JOLH,B00004WG3C,Amazon Customer,"[31, 31]","My family bought this series because we enjoyed Penelope Keith so much as Margot Ledbetter in Good Neighbors. I must say that though I enjoyed Good Neighbors, I liked this series much better.Penelope Keith plays Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, a new widow whose family has owned Grantleigh Estate for 400 years. Much to yher snobbish dismay, she is forced to auction the house to cover her late husband's death. The manor is bought by Richard DeVere (Peter Bowles). He is charming and well intentioned but he is (gasp!) in trade and (double gasp!) of Eastern European descent. He naturally makes many a faux pas trying to settle into his new home. He and Audrey are attracted to one another but they are both too set in their ways. He is too blue collar, she is too blue blood.Every episode in the series involves one of Audrey's plots. Either to win Richard, control him, snub him or put him in his place. To make money, to wrangle her way back into the manor, to run the Girl Guides or to save the town's railway station. She is aptly described by another character as a female bossy boots. And a very amusing one, I must add. Richard is usually caught unprepared by the Audrey onslaught but he wins a few battles himself. It's all great fun.While it is easy to make a big deal of the two very talented lead actors, the supporting cast is also very good. The slippery vicar; Audrey's mousy best friend Marjory; the grumpy shop keeper; and Richard's mother ""Mrs. Pooh"" are all great character actors and greatly add to the overall series.Unlike many sit-coms, To the Manor Born has something of a linear plot line. (Though not so much of one that you cannot watch an episode on it's own) And it has an actual ending. A very nice one too.The humor style is quite British so if you are not a fan of Brit-coms, you probably won't like it. If you feel you will like the series, I encourage you to buy the complete set rather than piece meal. Partly because of the linear plot line and partly because you will be hungry for more. This is a great series for snow days and when you are under the weather. It is suitable for children and very amusing for adults.",5,"Wonderful series, a true gem",1017446400,"03 30, 2002",2002,2148,"['family', 'bought', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'Penelope', 'Keith', 'so', 'much', 'Margot', 'Ledbetter', 'Good', 'Neighbors', 'must', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'Good', 'Neighbors', 'liked', 'series', 'much', 'Keith', 'plays', 'Audrey', 'fforbes-Hamilton', 'new', 'widow', 'family', 'owned', 'Grantleigh', 'Estate', '400', 'years', 'Much', 'yher', 'snobbish', 'dismay', 'forced', 'auction', 'house', 'cover', 'late', 'husband', 'death', 'manor', 'bought', 'Richard', 'DeVere', 'Peter', 'Bowles', 'charming', 'well', 'intentioned', 'gasp', 'trade', 'double', 'gasp', 'Eastern', 'European', 'descent', 'naturally', 'many', 'faux', 'pas', 'trying', 'settle', 'new', 'home', 'Audrey', 'are', 'attracted', 'one', 'are', 'too', 'set', 'ways', 'too', 'blue', 'collar', 'too', 'blue', 'blood.Every', 'episode', 'series', 'one', 'Audrey', 'plots', 'win', 'Richard', 'control', 'snub', 'put', 'place', 'make', 'money', 'wrangle', 'way', 'back', 'manor', 'run', 'Girl', 'Guides', 'save', 'town', 'railway', 'station', 'aptly', 'described', 'character', 'female', 'bossy', 'boots', 'very', 'amusing', 'one', 'must', 'add', 'Richard', 'usually', 'caught', 'unprepared', 'Audrey', 'onslaught', 'few', 'battles', 'great', 'fun.While', 'easy', 'make', 'big', 'deal', 'two', 'very', 'talented', 'lead', 'actors', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'slippery', 'vicar', 'Audrey', 'mousy', 'best', 'friend', 'Marjory', 'grumpy', 'shop', 'keeper', 'Richard', 'mother', 'Mrs.', 'Pooh', 'are', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'greatly', 'add', 'overall', 'series.Unlike', 'many', 'sit-coms', 'Manor', 'Born', 'something', 'linear', 'plot', 'line', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'watch', 'episode', 'own', 'actual', 'ending', 'very', 'nice', 'one', 'too.The', 'humor', 'style', 'quite', 'British', 'so', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'Brit-coms', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'feel', 'will', 'like', 'series', 'encourage', 'buy', 'complete', 'set', 'rather', 'piece', 'meal', 'Partly', 'linear', 'plot', 'line', 'partly', 'will', 'be', 'hungry', 'more', 'great', 'series', 'snow', 'days', 'when', 'are', 'weather', 'suitable', 'children', 'very', 'amusing', 'adults']",To the Manor Born - Gift Set VHS
554605,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,B00004WG3C,darragh o'donoghue,"[8, 37]","As a comedy, 'To the Manor Born' was never particularly uproarious, even at the time.  During especially lumbering episodes, you can imagine a young producer prodding audience members with a pole, such is the feeble muffle of the laughter.  The inert primitivism of the comic drama is matched by a far more serious ridiculing of the labouring classes, all bumbling 'oo-ar' stereotypes that would have seemed far-fetched in Stella Gibbons' classic rural satire 'Cold Comfort Farm'.  The sheen of glamour the country house setting should suggest is actually tatty and tarnished (budgetary stinginess?).  The whole thing would actually be unwatchable if it wasn't for the relaxed skill and immense charm of the leads, Peter Bowles and Penelope Keith, King and Queen of British Light Entertainment.If it fails as comedy or romance, 'Manor' was of immense cultural importance.  Made in the early years of the Thatcher administration, the programme aimed to reconcile two mutually conflicting ideals of British Conservatism - the centuries-old, tradition-bound, socially congealed yet communal, landed gentry, represented by Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, now economically and politically a dead duck, but receptacle for what so any believe is best and characteristic in British Culture; and the radical conservatism of the new regime, economically aggressive, socially fluid, rule-breaking, go-getting.  In fact, the laissez-faire decentralising self-centredness of the latter was actually destroying the former, leading to anxieties this programme seeks to assauge.  Beginning with a death and the disruptions of homelessness, the programme moves like a Shakespearean comedy towards political Hymen, playing out all the tensions and fears in between, crises about identity, class, nationality, gender, generations, home.  In a superb, time-honoured allegory, the manor represents the nation, and the struggle beween Audrey and Richard is for its soul.  As happened so often during the 1980s, the proletariat are bandied about like so many frayed shuttlecocks.",3,Fascinating piece of British cultural history.,1010534400,"01 9, 2002",2002,2049,"['comedy', 'Manor', 'Born', 'was', 'never', 'particularly', 'uproarious', 'even', 'time', 'especially', 'lumbering', 'episodes', 'can', 'imagine', 'young', 'producer', 'prodding', 'audience', 'members', 'pole', 'such', 'feeble', 'muffle', 'laughter', 'inert', 'primitivism', 'comic', 'drama', 'matched', 'far', 'more', 'serious', 'ridiculing', 'labouring', 'classes', 'bumbling', ""'oo-ar"", 'stereotypes', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'far-fetched', 'Stella', 'Gibbons', 'classic', 'rural', 'satire', 'Comfort', 'Farm', 'sheen', 'glamour', 'country', 'house', 'setting', 'should', 'suggest', 'actually', 'tatty', 'tarnished', 'budgetary', 'stinginess', 'whole', 'thing', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'unwatchable', 'was', ""n't"", 'relaxed', 'skill', 'immense', 'charm', 'leads', 'Peter', 'Bowles', 'Penelope', 'Keith', 'King', 'Queen', 'British', 'Light', 'Entertainment.If', 'comedy', 'romance', 'was', 'immense', 'cultural', 'importance', 'Made', 'early', 'years', 'Thatcher', 'administration', 'programme', 'aimed', 'reconcile', 'two', 'mutually', 'conflicting', 'ideals', 'British', 'Conservatism', 'centuries-old', 'tradition-bound', 'socially', 'congealed', 'yet', 'communal', 'landed', 'gentry', 'represented', 'Audrey', 'fforbes-Hamilton', 'now', 'economically', 'politically', 'dead', 'duck', 'receptacle', 'what', 'believe', 'best', 'characteristic', 'British', 'Culture', 'radical', 'conservatism', 'new', 'regime', 'economically', 'aggressive', 'socially', 'fluid', 'rule-breaking', 'go-getting', 'fact', 'laissez-faire', 'decentralising', 'self-centredness', 'latter', 'was', 'actually', 'destroying', 'former', 'leading', 'anxieties', 'programme', 'assauge', 'Beginning', 'death', 'disruptions', 'homelessness', 'programme', 'moves', 'Shakespearean', 'comedy', 'towards', 'political', 'Hymen', 'playing', 'out', 'tensions', 'fears', 'crises', 'identity', 'class', 'nationality', 'gender', 'generations', 'home', 'superb', 'time-honoured', 'allegory', 'manor', 'nation', 'struggle', 'beween', 'Audrey', 'Richard', 'soul', 'happened', 'so', 'often', '1980s', 'proletariat', 'are', 'bandied', 'so', 'many', 'frayed', 'shuttlecocks']",To the Manor Born - Gift Set VHS
554606,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B00004WG3C,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[6, 7]","'To the Manor Born' is one of the better Brit-coms, witty and intelligent without being over-the-top or inaccessible.  It has an oh-so-British tone to it, deliberately so, as it looks with grace and humour at the clash of cultures in modern Britain, the clash between tradition and modernity (finding out that neither is always what it seems), as well as the clash between social classes.  All of this is done in such a light-hearted manor, er, manner, that one scarcely realises the biting and insightful satire that runs alongside the comedic situations.The series begins as Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, a straight-backed, upper-crust woman of breeding who revels in her situation, is celebrating the funeral of her husband (yes, celebrating).  Meanwhile, Richard Devere, wealthy (read, nouveau riche) financial officer heading a multinational conglomerate of food stores, arrives in the village in search of a classic gentleman's period home in the English countryside.  As Audrey's husband was not one to keep up with the bills, she discovers that she is in fact bankrupt, and is forced to sell the manor.  Richard Devere buys it at auction; Audrey is a surprising twist retains the estate's hunting lodge down the road, and the stage is set for the tensions between new homeowner and historical lady of the manor.Supplementing the main characters are Audrey's best friend Marjorie, who variously has designs on Richard Devere, but these are almost always thwarted; Richard's mother, Mrs. Pu (Poluviska, actually, but the name is reduced for ease by Audrey); Ned, the traditional groundskeeper who helps keep the traditions alive with Audrey; and finally, Brabinger, the quintessential English butler, who relocates to the old lodge with his mistress Audrey, and always has a few suprises up his sleeve.There are twenty-one episodes in all, filmed and broadcast over a two-year period in 1979-1981.  These run from the start of Audrey's losing the manor through to her regaining the manor, along with the hand of Richard in marriage, but not by the means often expected throughout the series.  Throughout the episodes, Audrey is constantly introduced to 'ordinary life', from having to rely on the National Health for her doctor rather than private-pay, personal service, to having difficulties in shopping in supermarkets (Devere's, as it turns out) and not being able to entertain as she once did, or go on holiday (this makes for perhaps the best episode of the lot, save for the first and final episodes).  Meanwhile, Devere gets lessons in being lord of the manor by the ever-present Audrey, who counsels him on everything from horse-purchasing to community responsbilities.  Despite his wealth, Audrey says, 'he is still at the bottom of it all a grocer.'  This is a biting commentary -- the upper-class disdain for the working class is an undercurrent here, and the entitled/en-nobled folk in Parliament used to insult both Ted Heath and Margaret Thatcher, who were both children of shopkeepers, by using the term 'grocer' to describe them.From the threadbare carpets to the when-we-were-in-India knick-knacks to the church clock that never worked properly, this is a wonderfully crafted comedy trip through a slice of British culture that is both past and future.  These are not 'issues' episodes -- 'To the Manor Born' educates by stealth.  One might be completely unaware of having been taught ways of acting and being.  Grantley Manor is a perfect backdrop (shot in a town with the very English-sounding name of Cricket St. Thomas), and the actors are perfectly selected.  Penelope Keith as Audrey fforbes-Hamilton has the kind of mannerisms and deadpan delivery befitting a displaced socialite; Peter Bowles has the blustering presence as a self-assured businessman flustered in his new environment.  Old Ned (played by MIchael Bilton) and Brabinger (John Rudling) are perfected cast in both physical type and acting ability.  Angela Thorne as Marjorie Frobisher, the life-long friend of Audrey, always in her shadow, is great as the 'straight man' against whom Audrey's humour unfolds.The DVD release contains special features including bits about Penelope Keith and Peter Bowles, as well as excerpts from the late-90s radio broadcasts on BBC2.This is a perfect show, certain to win the heart of any Anglophile.",5,"Some are born great, some achieve greatness...",1091491200,"08 3, 2004",2004,4324,"['Manor', 'Born', 'one', 'better', 'Brit-coms', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'being', 'over-the-top', 'inaccessible', 'oh-so-British', 'tone', 'deliberately', 'so', 'grace', 'humour', 'clash', 'cultures', 'modern', 'Britain', 'clash', 'tradition', 'modernity', 'finding', 'out', 'always', 'what', 'as', 'well', 'clash', 'social', 'classes', 'done', 'such', 'light-hearted', 'manor', 'er', 'manner', 'one', 'scarcely', 'biting', 'insightful', 'satire', 'comedic', 'situations.The', 'series', 'Audrey', 'fforbes-Hamilton', 'straight-backed', 'upper-crust', 'woman', 'breeding', 'who', 'revels', 'situation', 'celebrating', 'funeral', 'husband', 'yes', 'celebrating', 'Meanwhile', 'Richard', 'Devere', 'wealthy', 'read', 'nouveau', 'riche', 'financial', 'officer', 'heading', 'multinational', 'conglomerate', 'food', 'stores', 'arrives', 'village', 'search', 'classic', 'gentleman', 'period', 'home', 'English', 'countryside', 'Audrey', 'husband', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'keep', 'up', 'bills', 'fact', 'bankrupt', 'forced', 'sell', 'manor', 'Richard', 'Devere', 'auction', 'Audrey', 'surprising', 'twist', 'estate', 'hunting', 'lodge', 'road', 'stage', 'set', 'tensions', 'new', 'homeowner', 'historical', 'lady', 'manor.Supplementing', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Audrey', 'best', 'friend', 'Marjorie', 'who', 'variously', 'designs', 'Richard', 'Devere', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'thwarted', 'Richard', 'mother', 'Mrs.', 'Pu', 'Poluviska', 'actually', 'name', 'reduced', 'ease', 'Audrey', 'Ned', 'traditional', 'groundskeeper', 'who', 'keep', 'traditions', 'alive', 'Audrey', 'finally', 'Brabinger', 'quintessential', 'English', 'butler', 'who', 'old', 'lodge', 'mistress', 'Audrey', 'always', 'few', 'up', 'sleeve.There', 'are', 'twenty-one', 'episodes', 'filmed', 'broadcast', 'two-year', 'period', '1979-1981', 'run', 'start', 'Audrey', 'losing', 'manor', 'regaining', 'manor', 'hand', 'Richard', 'marriage', 'not', 'means', 'often', 'expected', 'series', 'episodes', 'Audrey', 'constantly', 'introduced', ""'ordinary"", 'life', 'having', 'rely', 'National', 'Health', 'doctor', 'rather', 'private-pay', 'personal', 'service', 'having', 'difficulties', 'shopping', 'supermarkets', 'Devere', 'out', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'entertain', 'once', 'did', 'go', 'holiday', 'perhaps', 'best', 'episode', 'lot', 'save', 'first', 'final', 'episodes', 'Meanwhile', 'Devere', 'lessons', 'being', 'lord', 'manor', 'ever-present', 'Audrey', 'who', 'everything', 'horse-purchasing', 'community', 'responsbilities', 'wealth', 'Audrey', 'still', 'bottom', 'grocer', 'biting', 'commentary', 'upper-class', 'disdain', 'working', 'class', 'undercurrent', 'here', 'entitled/en-nobled', 'folk', 'Parliament', 'used', 'insult', 'Ted', 'Heath', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'who', 'were', 'children', 'shopkeepers', 'using', 'term', ""'grocer"", 'describe', 'threadbare', 'when-we-were-in-India', 'knick-knacks', 'church', 'clock', 'never', 'worked', 'properly', 'wonderfully', 'crafted', 'comedy', 'trip', 'slice', 'British', 'culture', 'past', 'future', 'are', 'not', ""'issues"", 'episodes', 'Manor', 'Born', 'educates', 'stealth', 'One', 'might', 'be', 'completely', 'unaware', 'having', 'been', 'taught', 'ways', 'acting', 'being', 'Grantley', 'Manor', 'perfect', 'backdrop', 'shot', 'town', 'very', 'English-sounding', 'name', 'Cricket', 'St.', 'Thomas', 'actors', 'are', 'perfectly', 'selected', 'Penelope', 'Keith', 'Audrey', 'fforbes-Hamilton', 'kind', 'mannerisms', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'befitting', 'displaced', 'socialite', 'Peter', 'Bowles', 'blustering', 'presence', 'self-assured', 'businessman', 'flustered', 'new', 'environment', 'Old', 'Ned', 'played', 'MIchael', 'Bilton', 'Brabinger', 'John', 'Rudling', 'are', 'perfected', 'cast', 'physical', 'type', 'acting', 'ability', 'Angela', 'Thorne', 'Marjorie', 'Frobisher', 'life-long', 'friend', 'Audrey', 'always', 'shadow', 'great', ""'straight"", 'man', 'whom', 'Audrey', 'humour', 'unfolds.The', 'DVD', 'release', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'bits', 'Penelope', 'Keith', 'Peter', 'Bowles', 'as', 'well', 'excerpts', 'late-90s', 'radio', 'broadcasts', 'BBC2.This', 'perfect', 'show', 'certain', 'win', 'heart', 'Anglophile']",To the Manor Born - Gift Set VHS

Yet almost immediately, she learns the property must be sold to satisfy her husband's death.  When it is sold to Richard DeVere (formerly named Polouvicka, as his aging mother still is) (played by Peter Bowles), owner of a grocery chain, she is shaken to see the land sold to someone (gasp) in trade, but her retreat takes her only as far as the Lodge, in good viewing distance of the Manor.  From there, she will alternately assist and wage war on DeVere, who is determined to bring change to the Manor.  And, as she learns that DeVere is not quite as unattractive as she thought, she wonders if marriage is not the quickest path back to the Manor and out of her financial woes . . .Penelope Keith makes this series.  She convincingly plays an aristocrat brought on hard times, but never surrendering in any way.  She is assisted not only by Bowles, but by a cast of supporting actors who bring to life rural England in this classy class-warfare comedy.

That cast was perfect and the show a classic, but the person who stood out for me was Penelope Keith.  She just stole every scene she was in.  Quite recently I discovered ""To The Manor Born"" at my local library in their video department and was so happy to see that this series starred Miss Keith as well.  I checked out as many as I was allowed on my card and couldn't wait to watch them all.  Needless to say (or I wouldn't bother to write this) this show was wonderful as well and Penelope Keith is at her best.  Upon viewing every episode, although a ""special Christmas episode"" was NOT on my library's edition, I discovered the boxed set for sale on Amazon and ordered it as soon I saw it.Not as cartoonish as Margot in Good Neighbors, her ""Audrey fforbes-Hamilton"" is quite a character indeed and Miss Keith makes her pathetic, comedic, pompous AND accessible all at the same time.  I can't imagine anyone else playing this role as well as Penelope Keith.  If you are a fan of her work or if you are a just a fan of Britain's funniest female actors such as Patricia Routledge, Mollie Sudgen, The AbFab ""Ladies"" etc.,then you MUST, MUST, MUST own the work of Penelope Keith, as she, at least to me, is the Grande Dame of them all!  I would highly suggest that you please buy the boxed set to see the entire series in order.  And as a special feature there's a ""lost"" Christmas episode at the end of the last episode on Tape 6.  In addition to Penelope Keith, I'm sure you'll enjoy this very gifted supporting cast as well and the location shots are very beautiful!

554610,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,B00004WG3C,Simon Davis,"[36, 39]","""To The Manor Born"", is definately in my top 5 all-time favourite British comedies from any decade and I feel is the greatest piece of work ever accomplished by talented British actress Penelope Keith so far. As British as British can be, it is filled with marvellous characters, excellent writing, a near perfect scenerio for the talents involved and just enough commentary on the British Class System for all of us to see a little bit of ourselves in some of the situations that abound in this terrific series. Penelope Keith is the heart and soul of this production and never has there been a more perfect blending of an actresses' personality and screen image with that of a created character.Produced between 1979 and 1981 ""To The Manor Born"", was unique in that the series provided self contained episodes with separate storylines that however developed the characters right up to the conclusion of the series when there was an actual final concluding story developed for the series to conclude on. In this way the series is like an extended ""mini-series"" and can be either enjoyed as individual episodes or as a longer viewing experience. ""To The Manor Born"", relates the story of recently widowed Audrey Fforbes-Hamilton, the blue blooded owner of Grantleigh Manor which has been in her late husband's family for 400 years. After the funeral Audrey, thinking all her birthdays have come at once suddenly is brought down to earth when she is informed that her late husband Martin was hoplessly in debt and that to cover the debts of the estate she has to sell the Manor. What makes a terrible situation like this even worse is that at the auction the ancestral home is purchased by none other than  a certain Richard De Vere who turns out to Audrey's horror to be not only ""trade"", but shock of all shocks not even British! What develops over many episodes is the highly amusing sparring between Audrey, who moves down the drive to the old lodge intent on keeping an eye on De Vere's plans for the estate, and Richard who is determined to move up in the world to the sphere of ""Landed Gentry"". The two have many hilarious battles over the course of the series whether it be disputing Richard's proper role as ""Lord of the Manor"", fighting over who should run the annual Hunt Ball, trying not to loose face while purchasing a new horse or trying to upgrade the estate by removing the ancient hedgerows. ""Saving face"" is another theme which features in many episodes as the now cash strapped Audrey attempts to keep Richard in his proper place by pretending that ""nothing has really changed"" by such means as supposedly still taking her annual holiday to Spain while never actually leaving the estate or working out the right timing for writing cheques that are guaranteed to bounce! Naturally as the series develops the hate relationship between this oddly matched couple slowly turns to affection and then love at the nicely worked out conclusion.The many hilarious situations in this brilliant series are hugely aided by some of the best writing and actors to be assembled in any one British comedy in any decade. The subtle digs at the firmly entrenced British Class System will have you splitting your sides with laughter and Penelope Keith is wonderful portraying a character down on her luck who will not buge one inch for this ""upstart grocer' who has invaded her secure world at Grantleigh Manor. Peter Bowles playing Richard has a difficult role as the straight man of the piece but does wonderfully up against the colourful Audrey portraying a man of humble background determined to climb the social ladder. ""To The Manor Born"",abounds with other terrific characters as well. Angela Thorne a well known face on British television plays Audrey's best friend and fellow conspirator against Richard, Margery Frobisher. Daphne Heard playing the delightful ""Mrs. Poo"", Richard's mother steals every scene she is in with her wonderful comic playing. The actors playing the various domestics on the program also add spark to the proceedings with special mention going to John Rudling as the very proper Brabinger, Audrey's manservant and especially Michael Bilton as old Ned, the estate handyman.If like myself you appreciate well written comedy then you cannot go past ""To The Manor Born"". The best way to purchase this great series is with the VHS boxed set which contains all the episodes uncut and in order. It also has the special treat of including the rarely seen 1979 Christmas episode which is not normally included in reruns and which is very funny indeed involving Audrey and Richard in a competition to provide the best Nativity Crib for the Parish Church. I highly recommend you spend some time enjoying this wonderful series which is as fresh today as it was when it was first aired in the early 1980s. Enjoy Audrey Fforbes-Hamilton down on her luck, battling the upstart grocer in the classic ""To The Manor Born"".",5,One Of The Greatest British Comedies Of All Time,1060214400,"08 7,
