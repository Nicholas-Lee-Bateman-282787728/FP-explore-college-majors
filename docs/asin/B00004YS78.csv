The movie dragged on, as Hope is hopeless in his older age. Calling of &#34;Japs&#34; as such not used in movies anymore, neither is the drubbing of ugly women, Diller. I can think of a lot more ugly women then Diller, but she was the but of ugly jokes here.

560083,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00004YS78,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 7]","It is rather ironic that Bob Hope (who turned 100 today) provided so much entertainment for American troops in the field from World War II to Vietnam and beyond yet could only come up with this less than stellar military comedy.  Bob plays the titular Sgt. O'Farrell, the power behind the throne on a U.S. base during World War II.  When the base turns dry, the result of a Japanese torpedo and unsympathetic officeers, the sarge comes up with a plan, involving his own private navy, to get beer to the troops.  O'Farrell is helped by Calvin Coolidge Ishimura (Mako), a Japanese deserter hiding out on the island.  Once the boys are liquored up, the next goal becomes female companionship.  The good news is that this brings Gina Lollobrigida to the island; the bad news is that it also brings Phyllis Diller, who plays Nellie Krause.  She takes a liking to O'Farrell, which makes it difficult for him to go after Gina (or ""Maria"" as she is called--but no name on earth is as good as Gina Lollobrigida).  Hope and Diller worked fine in their first film together, ""Eight on the Lam,"" but not this time around as she relentlessly pursues O'Farrell.  There is some good slapstick shtick and good lines here and there, but overall it is rather uneven.  Is this the best Bob Hope comedy film ever?  No, that remains ""Paleface,"" even above the Road pictures.  But it is not as bad as ""The Iron Petticoat"" with Katharine Hepburn.  Be glad I do not let anybody see my copy of that film.  ""The Private Navy of Sgt. O'Farrell"" is worth one look, but I would not consider it worth repeat viewings.",3,A surprisingly sub-par military comedy from Bob Hope,1054166400,"05 29, 2003",2003,1586,"['rather', 'ironic', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'who', 'turned', '100', 'today', 'provided', 'so', 'much', 'entertainment', 'American', 'troops', 'field', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Vietnam', 'yet', 'could', 'only', 'come', 'up', 'less', 'stellar', 'military', 'comedy', 'Bob', 'titular', 'Sgt', ""O'Farrell"", 'power', 'throne', 'U.S.', 'base', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'When', 'base', 'dry', 'result', 'Japanese', 'torpedo', 'unsympathetic', 'officeers', 'sarge', 'up', 'plan', 'involving', 'own', 'private', 'navy', 'get', 'beer', 'troops', ""O'Farrell"", 'helped', 'Calvin', 'Coolidge', 'Ishimura', 'Mako', 'Japanese', 'deserter', 'hiding', 'out', 'island', 'boys', 'are', 'liquored', 'up', 'next', 'goal', 'female', 'companionship', 'good', 'news', 'Gina', 'Lollobrigida', 'island', 'bad', 'news', 'also', 'Phyllis', 'Diller', 'who', 'Nellie', 'Krause', 'liking', ""O'Farrell"", 'difficult', 'go', 'Gina', 'Maria', 'called', 'name', 'earth', 'as', 'good', 'Gina', 'Lollobrigida', 'Hope', 'Diller', 'worked', 'fine', 'first', 'film', 'together', 'Eight', 'Lam', 'not', 'time', 'around', 'relentlessly', ""O'Farrell"", 'good', 'slapstick', 'shtick', 'good', 'lines', 'here', 'there', 'overall', 'rather', 'uneven', 'best', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'comedy', 'film', 'ever', 'No', 'Paleface', 'even', 'Road', 'pictures', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'Iron', 'Petticoat', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'Be', 'glad', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'anybody', 'see', 'copy', 'film', 'Private', 'Navy', 'Sgt', ""O'Farrell"", 'worth', 'one', 'look', 'would', 'not', 'consider', 'worth', 'repeat', 'viewings']",The Private Navy of Sgt.

Bob Hope was an icon and a man no one could ever find fault with. His acting was what it was and Phyllis Diller did her thing as well (sometimes too much). As I said before, it was what it was for its time. I still don't know what was Dick Sargent's part and why it was in the movie, but I am sure there must be a purpose to it. The plot and outcome predicable again for its time. With all that said, I'd rather watch a movie like this than some of the new ones which are much too graphic and unrealistic.
