1600974,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B009OE2O1Q,A. Burchfield,"[1, 2]","I first noticed Season 3 was coming out, I think, before Christmas- but the delivery date kept being pushed back. I finally ordered it in January- and got hit by a shipping delay- but now it's finally in my hands. The set comes on 5 discs (Amazon still lists it as 1) placed in two ordinary sized DVD cases- these are placed in a box with a lid on it, I've never seen a DVD box like this one.I have the original release edition of Season 1,  almost exactly the same cover photo is used for this set instead of an appropriate Season 3 image (the background, though, is Monument Valley Utah!), and is also used on the DVD cases (original Season 1 had individual case pictures- 3 cases- and individual cast pictures on each DVD). No production information of any sort on the DVD cases.A couple of others have posted that the set is presented in &#34;production&#34; order rather than &#34;broadcast&#34; order- I have no idea about that but I do think the image quality is pretty good (I've only watched the two part series finale). The color is probably about like the original broadcast and the image clarity is, I think,  just a &#34;tiny&#34; bit less than my copy of Season 1. The sound level is actually &#34;loud&#34; for a DVD, I had to turn my TV set down lower than I usually do- DVD's are usually the other way around, I've found. You want closed captioning ?-  you're out of luck (the original Season 1 was CC). The feature I miss the most on this release is that episodes aren't divided by chapters, click &#34;next&#34; on your remote and instead of jumping forward a bit in that episode you'll find yourself looking at the DVD menu (again a loss from the first release).I'll buy Second season too, especially if it gets those little improvements- and someone gets around to releasing it.",4,"Finally got it, not badly done for the price&#8230;&#8230;it is 5 discs, not 1",1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,1799,"['first', 'noticed', 'Season', '3', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'think', 'Christmas-', 'delivery', 'date', 'kept', 'being', 'pushed', 'back', 'finally', 'ordered', 'January-', 'got', 'hit', 'shipping', 'delay-', 'now', 'finally', 'hands', 'set', '5', 'discs', 'Amazon', 'still', '1', 'placed', 'two', 'ordinary', 'sized', 'DVD', 'cases-', 'are', 'placed', 'box', 'lid', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'DVD', 'box', 'one.I', 'have', 'original', 'release', 'edition', 'Season', '1', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'cover', 'photo', 'used', 'set', 'instead', 'appropriate', 'Season', '3', 'image', 'background', 'Monument', 'Valley', 'Utah', 'also', 'used', 'DVD', 'cases', 'original', 'Season', '1', 'had', 'individual', 'case', 'pictures-', '3', 'cases-', 'individual', 'cast', 'pictures', 'DVD', 'production', 'information', 'sort', 'DVD', 'cases.A', 'couple', 'others', 'have', 'posted', 'set', 'presented', '34', 'production', '34', 'order', 'rather', '34', 'broadcast', '34', 'order-', 'have', 'idea', 'do', 'think', 'image', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', ""'ve"", 'only', 'watched', 'two', 'part', 'series', 'finale', 'color', 'probably', 'original', 'broadcast', 'image', 'clarity', 'think', 'just', '34', 'tiny', '34', 'bit', 'less', 'copy', 'Season', '1', 'sound', 'level', 'actually', '34', 'loud', '34', 'DVD', 'had', 'turn', 'TV', 'set', 'down', 'lower', 'usually', 'do-', 'DVD', 'are', 'usually', 'other', 'way', ""'ve"", 'found', 'want', 'closed', 'captioning', ""'re"", 'luck', 'original', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'CC', 'feature', 'miss', 'most', 'release', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'divided', 'chapters', 'click', '34', 'next', '34', 'remote', 'instead', 'jumping', 'forward', 'bit', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'find', 'looking', 'DVD', 'menu', 'again', 'loss', 'first', 'release', '.I', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'Second', 'season', 'too', 'especially', 'little', 'improvements-', 'someone', 'around', 'releasing']",The Young Riders Complete Season 3 Gift Box

1600983,A29XWXJ525HH7O,B009OE2O1Q,MyD -- The Viewpoint,"[35, 37]","This show was very popular with an extremely loyal fan base while airing.  It was once rated the most highly anticipated DVD release of any TV show.  There was a delay with the release of season two over distribution rights, but luckily that has been resolved and we have all three seasons now.THE STORY: Set just before the American Civil War, this series presented a highly fictionalized account of the heyday of the Pony Express. Its focus was a group of young Express riders based at the waystation in Sweetwater, Kansas. Running the station was ex-Texas Ranger and all-around eccentric Teaspoon Hunter. The role of cook, housekeeper and mother hen was filled first by Emma and later by Rachel. The riders included the future ""Buffalo Bill"" Cody and James Butler (""Wild Bill"") Hickok, as well as Ike, a mute, Buck, a half-White/half-Kiowa scout and the Kid, a quiet Southerner. Their final member was Lou, a young woman who lived and worked with the riders disguised as a boy. In second season, their group was joined by Noah Dixon.PACKAGING:  The set includes five discs in two regular sized DVD cases and housed in a sort of collector's box snugly fitting the two standard DVD cases.",4,TOP RATED SHOW FOR DVD RELEASE,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,1189,"['show', 'was', 'very', 'popular', 'extremely', 'loyal', 'fan', 'base', 'airing', 'was', 'once', 'rated', 'most', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'DVD', 'release', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'delay', 'release', 'season', 'two', 'distribution', 'rights', 'luckily', 'been', 'resolved', 'have', 'three', 'seasons', 'now.THE', 'STORY', 'Set', 'just', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'series', 'presented', 'highly', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'heyday', 'Pony', 'Express', 'focus', 'was', 'group', 'young', 'Express', 'riders', 'based', 'waystation', 'Sweetwater', 'Kansas', 'Running', 'station', 'was', 'ex-Texas', 'Ranger', 'all-around', 'eccentric', 'Teaspoon', 'Hunter', 'role', 'cook', 'housekeeper', 'mother', 'hen', 'was', 'filled', 'first', 'Emma', 'later', 'Rachel', 'riders', 'included', 'future', 'Buffalo', 'Bill', 'Cody', 'James', 'Butler', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickok', 'as', 'well', 'Ike', 'mute', 'Buck', 'half-White/half-Kiowa', 'scout', 'Kid', 'quiet', 'Southerner', 'final', 'member', 'was', 'Lou', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'lived', 'worked', 'riders', 'disguised', 'boy', 'second', 'season', 'group', 'was', 'joined', 'Noah', 'Dixon.PACKAGING', 'set', 'five', 'discs', 'two', 'regular', 'sized', 'DVD', 'cases', 'housed', 'sort', 'collector', 'box', 'snugly', 'fitting', 'two', 'standard', 'DVD', 'cases']",The Young Riders Complete Season 3 Gift Box
