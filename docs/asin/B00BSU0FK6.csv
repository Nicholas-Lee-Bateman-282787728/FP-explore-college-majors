1638044,A1A80S82ZGLHZN,B00BSU0FK6,M.Merkersen,"[13, 14]","This film, first and foremost, is a vehicle of self-promotion for its director, Ms. Anderson. Beyond that, it shows young, beautiful women talking very briefly about their lives. That has value and interest, however, viewers should not draw conclusions about porn stars from such scanty information. This film is not a documentary. This film is a Playboy-type behind-the-scenes of a nudie photo shoot. That is fine, but, this film touts itself as offering insight through first-hand interviews. It doesn't.I'm reminded of the Diane Sawyer interview of a young Belladonna on Prime Time Live several years, ago. Belladonna comes across as a very lost soul. My heart goes out to her. Some of the women in this film seem lost or, at least, fooling themselves(and the viewer). One woman tearfully said she was afraid she might have ""f'd myself"" by going into this line of work. I would wonder the same thing.Some of the most truthful bits of information are spoken by Fran, the Adult Talent Agent. She said that with each scene, these women permanently lose a part of their souls, and that they should earmark half of their fortunes to therapy. One of the women said being a porn star is like being a stunt man, in that they are paid well because they are risking their lives doing this kind of work.If we can watch this film and filter what rings true to us as individuals from what we want to believe, we can begin to have a clearer idea of the lives of porn actors.",2,Answers No Questions,1373155200,"07 7, 2013",2013,1463,"['film', 'first', 'foremost', 'vehicle', 'self-promotion', 'director', 'Ms.', 'Anderson', 'Beyond', 'young', 'beautiful', 'women', 'talking', 'very', 'briefly', 'lives', 'value', 'interest', 'however', 'viewers', 'should', 'not', 'draw', 'conclusions', 'porn', 'stars', 'such', 'scanty', 'information', 'film', 'not', 'documentary', 'film', 'Playboy-type', 'behind-the-scenes', 'nudie', 'photo', 'shoot', 'fine', 'film', 'offering', 'insight', 'first-hand', 'interviews', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'Diane', 'Sawyer', 'interview', 'young', 'Belladonna', 'Prime', 'Time', 'Live', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'Belladonna', 'across', 'very', 'lost', 'soul', 'heart', 'out', 'women', 'film', 'seem', 'lost', 'least', 'fooling', 'viewer', 'One', 'woman', 'tearfully', 'said', 'was', 'afraid', 'might', 'have', 'f', ""'d"", 'myself', 'going', 'line', 'work', 'would', 'wonder', 'same', 'thing.Some', 'most', 'truthful', 'bits', 'information', 'are', 'spoken', 'Fran', 'Adult', 'Talent', 'Agent', 'said', 'scene', 'women', 'permanently', 'lose', 'part', 'souls', 'should', 'earmark', 'half', 'fortunes', 'therapy', 'One', 'women', 'said', 'being', 'porn', 'star', 'being', 'stunt', 'man', 'are', 'paid', 'well', 'are', 'risking', 'lives', 'doing', 'kind', 'work.If', 'can', 'watch', 'film', 'filter', 'what', 'true', 'individuals', 'what', 'want', 'believe', 'can', 'begin', 'have', 'clearer', 'idea', 'lives', 'porn', 'actors']",N/A

Yes, all these women are in porn because that was their first option. No one was there because they couldn't get a job somewhere else, support a drug habit, save money for college, or support their kid.  None of the girls had horrific stories about being raped by a family member or clergy.The film failed to achieve what it set out to do. The persona of the pron star doesn't change when they are in a studio with a camera on them. The film was superficial.  I think if she had interviewed old time porn stars and asked them how they started and where they are today, that would have been more interesting. Then showing the new stars those interviews and get a real response without their make up an glitter.This might be shocking or interesting to people who don't watch porn.2 stars for the nudity.",2,WE HAVE NO FILTER,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,971,"['Deborah', 'Anderson', 'porn', 'stars', 'who', 'are', 'mostly', 'age', '22-26', 'same', 'questions', 'have', 'pose', 'same', 'way', 'essentially', 'give', 'same', 'answer', 'Yes', 'women', 'are', 'porn', 'was', 'first', 'option', 'one', 'was', 'there', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'job', 'somewhere', 'else', 'support', 'drug', 'habit', 'save', 'money', 'college', 'support', 'kid', 'None', 'girls', 'had', 'horrific', 'stories', 'being', 'raped', 'family', 'member', 'clergy.The', 'film', 'failed', 'achieve', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'persona', 'pron', 'star', ""n't"", 'change', 'when', 'are', 'studio', 'camera', 'film', 'was', 'superficial', 'think', 'had', 'interviewed', 'old', 'time', 'porn', 'stars', 'asked', 'how', 'started', 'where', 'are', 'today', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'Then', 'showing', 'new', 'stars', 'interviews', 'get', 'real', 'response', 'make', 'up', 'glitter.This', 'might', 'be', 'shocking', 'interesting', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'porn.2', 'stars', 'nudity']",N/A
