213754,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,6300214575,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[12, 14]","I remember seeing &quot;The Day After&quot; on TV in 1983 and was very unimpressed.  Even with big names like Jason Robards and good FX you just didn't care about the characters.  Testament, which came out also in 1983 was a MUCH different story.  Jane Alexander stars as Carol Wetherly, a mother of a suburban California family, and the film starts out with the normalcy of family life.  They are watching TV when all of a sudden the TV show goes dead, and a newscast comes on to say the East Coast has been hit with nuclear weapons.  Just then a huge light comes through the window.This is a realistic depiction of what a limited nuclear war might be like for the few survivors, and here we end up caring about the people of the small town and especially the family it's focused on.  An old neighbor is a ham radio operator who has reached a few surviving communities, and we learn people are trying to get to Northern Canada where there are &quot;survival camps&quot;.  Other than that there is no info at all from the outside world.  The town gradually sinks into darkness, oblivion, and radiation sickness, while Carol tries to keep it together for her kids.  The father is played by William Devane (Marathon Man) and we see flashbacks from before the world was nuked.  We don't learn exactly how the war happened other than theories.One couple is well played by a young Kevin Costner and Rebecca DeMornay.As the film ends Carol finally loses it and cries, &quot;Who did this, God damn you!&quot; a la Charleton Heston in the end of Planet of the Apes.  There is one thing I'd like to see in an End-of-the-World film that's never really been explored:  namely the philosophical implications of the world ending.  I mean even in this great film, the characters are concerned with their immediate circumstance in their small community, not the bigger implications.  Well maybe I'll write one with that theme myself.Since the Cold War ended full scale nuclear war is unlikely, however individual nukes by terrorists are getting more and more of a possibility (9/11 proves they have the will to use them), not to mention the new &quot;Powell Doctrine&quot; of using tactical nukes in war.  We all must work to make sure all governments know that &quot;a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought&quot; (that quote ironically comes from Mr. Nuke himself, Ronald Reagan).There are some other good nuclear war films out there from 1963's Ladybird, Ladybird to 1959's On the Beach and 1967's British film The War Game.  Also 1989's Miracle Mile is good, but more a satire than a drama.",5,Best End of World Film there is; Excellent human drama,1070323200,"12 2, 2003",2003,2591,"['remember', 'seeing', 'quot', 'Day', 'quot', 'TV', '1983', 'was', 'very', 'unimpressed', 'Even', 'big', 'names', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'good', 'FX', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'Testament', 'came', 'out', 'also', '1983', 'was', 'MUCH', 'different', 'story', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'Carol', 'Wetherly', 'mother', 'suburban', 'California', 'family', 'film', 'out', 'normalcy', 'family', 'life', 'are', 'watching', 'TV', 'when', 'sudden', 'TV', 'show', 'dead', 'newscast', 'say', 'East', 'Coast', 'been', 'hit', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'Just', 'then', 'huge', 'light', 'window.This', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'what', 'limited', 'nuclear', 'war', 'might', 'be', 'few', 'survivors', 'here', 'end', 'up', 'caring', 'people', 'small', 'town', 'especially', 'family', 'focused', 'old', 'neighbor', 'ham', 'radio', 'operator', 'who', 'reached', 'few', 'surviving', 'communities', 'learn', 'people', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'Northern', 'Canada', 'where', 'are', 'quot', 'survival', 'camps', 'quot', 'Other', 'info', 'outside', 'world', 'town', 'gradually', 'darkness', 'oblivion', 'radiation', 'sickness', 'Carol', 'keep', 'together', 'kids', 'father', 'played', 'William', 'Devane', 'Marathon', 'Man', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'world', 'was', 'nuked', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'exactly', 'how', 'war', 'happened', 'other', 'theories.One', 'couple', 'well', 'played', 'young', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Rebecca', 'DeMornay.As', 'film', 'Carol', 'finally', 'cries', 'quot', 'Who', 'did', 'God', 'quot', 'la', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'end', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'one', 'thing', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'End-of-the-World', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'explored', 'namely', 'philosophical', 'implications', 'world', 'ending', 'mean', 'even', 'great', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'concerned', 'immediate', 'circumstance', 'small', 'community', 'not', 'bigger', 'implications', 'Well', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'write', 'one', 'theme', 'myself.Since', 'Cold', 'War', 'ended', 'full', 'scale', 'nuclear', 'war', 'unlikely', 'however', 'individual', 'nukes', 'terrorists', 'are', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'possibility', '9/11', 'proves', 'have', 'will', 'use', 'not', 'mention', 'new', 'quot', 'Powell', 'Doctrine', 'quot', 'using', 'tactical', 'nukes', 'war', 'must', 'work', 'make', 'sure', 'governments', 'know', 'quot', 'nuclear', 'war', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'won', 'must', 'never', 'be', 'fought', 'quot', 'quote', 'ironically', 'Mr.', 'Nuke', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'are', 'other', 'good', 'nuclear', 'war', 'films', 'out', 'there', '1963', 'Ladybird', 'Ladybird', '1959', 'Beach', '1967', 'British', 'film', 'War', 'Game', 'Also', '1989', 'Miracle', 'Mile', 'good', 'more', 'satire', 'drama']",Testament VHS
213755,A38CG7DUN18RVG,6300214575,Bill W.,"[4, 6]","I guess that I am an outlier on this one.  I found this movie to be barely watchable and only because I kept expecting something to happen.Spoilers follow.The natural comparison for this movie is The Day After, which I like a lot better.  Where the Day After succeeds is where this movie fails.  The scenarios are basically the same: following a massive nuclear attack, a small town survives and must deal with the literal and figurative fallout.  In both, they quickly lose contact with the outside world and face a grim and depressing new reality.The difference is completely in how the characters respond.  In the Day After, they begin working on the problem from the outset; determining how to measure radiation, how to limit exposure, what to expect medically and how to respond.  In Testament, they kind of shrug their shoulders.  Nobody seems to know anything or even to be inclined to go to the library to look it up.  Nobody does anything to limit exposure.  Almost nobody leaves to look for a better place.In the end, the movies end up in a similar place: with sickness settling in and most efforts failing in the face of catastrophic environmental damage.  But, in the Day After, people are trying to find a way to move forward.  The movie ends in a very dark place, with no clear resolution, but you still have the hope that people are working to find solutions and that some of them will probably survive.  In Testament, nobody is trying to find solutions; they are waiting to die, without taking even the most basic precautions against radiation.One movie highlights the human need, even in the face of overwhelming disaster, to learn, to understand, to work together, and to find some way forward.  The other has zombies shambling about hopelessly and helplessly, overwhelmed to the point of apathy.  I have no doubt that many people would respond to nuclear war in that way, but it doesn't make for a very engaging movie experience.",2,"4+ stars Amazon, 7.0 IMDB, really?",1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,1948,"['guess', 'am', 'outlier', 'one', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'barely', 'watchable', 'only', 'kept', 'expecting', 'something', 'happen.Spoilers', 'follow.The', 'natural', 'comparison', 'movie', 'Day', 'like', 'lot', 'better', 'Where', 'Day', 'where', 'movie', 'scenarios', 'are', 'basically', 'same', 'following', 'massive', 'nuclear', 'attack', 'small', 'town', 'survives', 'must', 'deal', 'literal', 'figurative', 'fallout', 'quickly', 'lose', 'contact', 'outside', 'world', 'face', 'grim', 'depressing', 'new', 'reality.The', 'difference', 'completely', 'how', 'characters', 'respond', 'Day', 'begin', 'working', 'problem', 'outset', 'determining', 'how', 'measure', 'radiation', 'how', 'limit', 'exposure', 'what', 'expect', 'medically', 'how', 'respond', 'Testament', 'kind', 'shrug', 'shoulders', 'Nobody', 'know', 'anything', 'even', 'be', 'inclined', 'go', 'library', 'look', 'up', 'Nobody', 'anything', 'limit', 'exposure', 'Almost', 'nobody', 'look', 'better', 'place.In', 'end', 'movies', 'end', 'up', 'similar', 'place', 'sickness', 'settling', 'most', 'efforts', 'failing', 'face', 'catastrophic', 'environmental', 'damage', 'Day', 'people', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'move', 'forward', 'movie', 'very', 'dark', 'place', 'clear', 'resolution', 'still', 'have', 'hope', 'people', 'are', 'working', 'find', 'solutions', 'will', 'probably', 'survive', 'Testament', 'nobody', 'trying', 'find', 'solutions', 'are', 'waiting', 'die', 'taking', 'even', 'most', 'basic', 'precautions', 'radiation.One', 'movie', 'human', 'need', 'even', 'face', 'overwhelming', 'disaster', 'learn', 'understand', 'work', 'together', 'find', 'way', 'forward', 'other', 'zombies', 'shambling', 'hopelessly', 'helplessly', 'overwhelmed', 'point', 'apathy', 'have', 'doubt', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'respond', 'nuclear', 'war', 'way', ""n't"", 'make', 'very', 'engaging', 'movie', 'experience']",Testament VHS

And just as surely it's a BRILLIANT film. Reducing the unfathomable and thus numbingly abstract concept of nuclear war to a single community and (mostly) to a single family. It's beautifully acted and scripted. And it's achingly, heart breakingly sad. I have been brought to tears just reading someone else's description of the film. (Of course, the same thing has happened the several times I have watched the film myself). If you are looking for a film that truly shows the devastation that would follow in the wake of a nuclear attack, this is it. None of the other films that deal with similar subject matter (&quot;The Day After&quot;, etc.) come remotely close.I cannot fathom why this movie has not yet been issued on DVD.

213761,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,6300214575,D. Hartley,"[2, 2]","Strange as it sounds, there was a ""golden era"" of anti-nuke films, circa 1980-1984 (a veritable flurry of cautionary tales, spurred on, no doubt, by the dreaded thought of Ronnie R's itchy trigger finger wagging ever more perilously close to The Button with every perceived Soviet slight).One of the best of the bunch (and as timely as ever, actually) is 1983's Testament. Originally an ""American Playhouse"" presentation on PBS, the film was released to theatres and garnered a well-deserved Best Actress nomination for Jane Alexander (she lost to Shirley MacLaine).Director Lynne Littman takes a low key, deliberately paced approach, but pulls no punches. Alexander, her husband (William DeVane) and three children (Roxana Zal, Ross Harris and Lukas Haas) live in sleepy Hamlin, California, an idyllic, Speilbergian suburbia, where it's just another day of getting the kids off to school, Dad off to work, and the garbage cans out to the curb. Alexander is directing the local elementary school production of ""The Pied Piper Of Hamlin"" (which becomes a significant, if somewhat obvious, allegory for what is about to happen to the citizenry of the ""real"" Hamlin).The children's afternoon cartoons are interrupted by a news flash that a number of nuclear explosions have occurred in New York. Then there is a flash of a whole different kind when nearby San Francisco (where DeVane has gone on a business trip) receives a direct strike.There is no exposition on the political climate that precipitates the attacks, but I think this is a wise decision by the filmmakers because it helps us zero in on the essential humanistic message of the film. All of the post-nuke horrors ensue, but they are presented sans the histrionics and melodrama that plagued the more widely-seen (and in my opinion, inferior) ""The Day After"". The fact that the nightmarish scenario unfolds amidst such everyday banality is what makes it so believably horrifying. As the children (and adults) of Hamlin succumb to the inevitable scourge of radiation sickness and (just like the children of the imaginary Hamlin) steadily ""disappear"", one by one, we are left haunted by the final line of the school production-""Your children are not dead. They will return when the world deserves them.""

It is about the aftermath of global war as seen from the eyes of a small town, and in  particular, one close-knit family.  Be forwarned, this movie is powerful  and unrelenting.  As the movie moves forward, it becomes more and more  depressing, and by the time the credits roll up, the viewer is spent.As  stated by the other reviewers, Jane Alexander's performance is nothing  short of magnificent, and I've never seen anything to match it.

213768,AAU7CAQIN5BAE,6300214575,"EliteLamo ""too weird to live, too rare to die""","[4, 5]","There are times in our lives, perhaps crossroads, where we can turn to the ones that surround us and think, in one way or another, what if this was their last trip to the store, what if this were their last holiday with us, what if this year was the very last time we would see them. In all its purpose, films on that same token come around every once and again, and show us, truly and significantly how important the art of cinema and film making can be. This powerful strong voice of something well grounded and objective, which can easily dig deep into the portals of our existence and show us, in no uncertain terms, how totally insignificant our lives can be in a blink of an eye, and yet how precious every moment of life is. Here then is Testament.If Jane Alexander, [in that era of nuke films, which for some strange and wonderfully odd reason my mother and I were into during the time when I was nine and asking about Hitler's lover and why we waste so much money on going into space when other's can't afford a healthy meal to get through the day] isn't enough to know from jumpstreet that this film would be emotionally charged with an approach so totally imaginary, as to show us perhaps the aftermath of a nuclear strike and the days following, leaves much to be desired to the world's power elite. 'Silo 9' and 'The Day After' and a little hidden gem called 'Threads', all touch on the subject with distorted cut scences of disaster, and plastic molded horrors with scences of mass death and the like, yet leave the viewer empty because of lack of creative emotions. (Save Jason Robbards obviously who is brilliant) Yet nothing, nothing can take us into the heart of the beast, and that is what Testament does, drops us right in the middle of the motherload.Jane Alexander is a determined mother who must pick the pieces up from a typical day, that leads to anything but a typical future for a ordinary family gutted by the days and weeks following a nuclear strike. Ms. Alexander never lets us escape the mentality that even though all is lost, the notion to move on, and to endure, is grippingly fascinating and totally real. Jane shows us the motherly love in the very lowest form's of mans cruelty, can be pure, non-contrived and utterly tangible. I never believed for once, that Jane was acting. I firmly believed I was watching, at some points, a real life documentary of her familie's life. The juxtaposition of the black and white home films of their lives before the strike, reminded me of a real family, facing real problems, in a real, true event that would and can happen. Jane lost children. Jane's hair will fall out. Jane will lose more children. Jane showed us the murder, the lust for love after losing a husband, the very coinage of our times during fallout and gives us the indication that with every reasonable notion, with every passing day, that indeed death approaches, and with that one must ascertain the situation in its entirety, and keep on being a mother. The Academy got this one right with a nom for Jane, and see the beginning of a career flourish with young Lukas Hass, pre Witness, and a cameo by Kevin Costner before his eruption into mainstream.Testament doesn't show us any CGI, it can't pretend to be something it's not, because it simply sets us up for what ALL of us, at some time or another would fear to the very bones of our existence, that loud siren sound of imminent danger, and for all that Testament was, it reminds us of how utterly miserable the world could be, but at the same time, in a wonderful sense of being together, shows us how we are capable of such wonderful, amazing and joyous love.Truly a masterpiece.",4,Terrifying and uncontrived.,1198022400,"12 19, 2007",2007,3679,"['are', 'times', 'lives', 'perhaps', 'crossroads', 'where', 'can', 'turn', 'ones', 'surround', 'think', 'one', 'way', 'what', 'was', 'last', 'trip', 'store', 'what', 'were', 'last', 'holiday', 'what', 'year', 'was', 'very', 'last', 'time', 'would', 'see', 'purpose', 'films', 'same', 'token', 'come', 'once', 'again', 'show', 'truly', 'significantly', 'how', 'important', 'art', 'cinema', 'film', 'making', 'can', 'be', 'powerful', 'strong', 'voice', 'something', 'well', 'grounded', 'objective', 'can', 'easily', 'dig', 'deep', 'portals', 'existence', 'show', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'how', 'totally', 'insignificant', 'lives', 'can', 'be', 'blink', 'eye', 'yet', 'how', 'precious', 'moment', 'life', 'Here', 'then', 'Testament.If', 'Jane', 'Alexander', '[', 'era', 'nuke', 'films', 'strange', 'wonderfully', 'odd', 'reason', 'mother', 'were', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'nine', 'asking', 'Hitler', 'lover', 'why', 'waste', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'going', 'space', 'when', 'other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'healthy', 'meal', 'get', 'day', ']', ""n't"", 'enough', 'know', 'jumpstreet', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'approach', 'so', 'totally', 'imaginary', 'show', 'perhaps', 'aftermath', 'nuclear', 'strike', 'days', 'following', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'world', 'power', 'elite', '9', 'Day', 'little', 'hidden', 'gem', 'called', ""'Threads"", 'touch', 'subject', 'distorted', 'cut', 'scences', 'disaster', 'plastic', 'molded', 'horrors', 'scences', 'mass', 'death', 'like', 'yet', 'leave', 'viewer', 'empty', 'lack', 'creative', 'emotions', 'Save', 'Jason', 'Robbards', 'obviously', 'who', 'brilliant', 'Yet', 'nothing', 'nothing', 'can', 'take', 'heart', 'beast', 'what', 'Testament', 'drops', 'right', 'middle', 'motherload.Jane', 'Alexander', 'determined', 'mother', 'who', 'must', 'pick', 'pieces', 'up', 'typical', 'day', 'anything', 'typical', 'future', 'ordinary', 'family', 'gutted', 'days', 'weeks', 'following', 'nuclear', 'strike', 'Ms.', 'Alexander', 'never', 'escape', 'mentality', 'even', 'lost', 'notion', 'move', 'endure', 'grippingly', 'fascinating', 'totally', 'real', 'Jane', 'motherly', 'love', 'very', 'lowest', 'form', 'mans', 'cruelty', 'can', 'be', 'pure', 'non-contrived', 'utterly', 'tangible', 'never', 'believed', 'once', 'Jane', 'was', 'acting', 'firmly', 'believed', 'was', 'watching', 'points', 'real', 'life', 'documentary', 'familie', 'life', 'juxtaposition', 'black', 'white', 'home', 'films', 'lives', 'strike', 'reminded', 'real', 'family', 'facing', 'real', 'problems', 'real', 'true', 'event', 'would', 'can', 'happen', 'Jane', 'lost', 'children', 'Jane', 'hair', 'will', 'fall', 'out', 'Jane', 'will', 'lose', 'more', 'children', 'Jane', 'showed', 'murder', 'lust', 'love', 'losing', 'husband', 'very', 'coinage', 'times', 'fallout', 'indication', 'reasonable', 'notion', 'passing', 'day', 'indeed', 'death', 'approaches', 'one', 'must', 'ascertain', 'situation', 'entirety', 'keep', 'being', 'mother', 'Academy', 'got', 'one', 'right', 'nom', 'Jane', 'see', 'beginning', 'career', 'flourish', 'young', 'Lukas', 'Hass', 'pre', 'Witness', 'cameo', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'eruption', 'mainstream.Testament', ""n't"", 'show', 'CGI', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'something', 'not', 'simply', 'up', 'what', 'ALL', 'time', 'would', 'fear', 'very', 'bones', 'existence', 'siren', 'sound', 'imminent', 'danger', 'Testament', 'was', 'how', 'utterly', 'miserable', 'world', 'could', 'be', 'same', 'time', 'wonderful', 'sense', 'being', 'together', 'how', 'are', 'capable', 'such', 'wonderful', 'amazing', 'joyous', 'love.Truly', 'masterpiece']",Testament VHS

Hart,"[19, 22]","I have a personal reason for reviewing this movie: the writer of the original short story, Carol Amen, was a good friend of mine from church before she died of cancer.  Carol told me she woke up in the middle of the night covered with sweat when she envisioned this story and wrote it in one sitting.  She worked closely with the screenwriter, John Sacret Young (of &quot;China Beach&quot; fame) and was very pleased that he was able to flesh out the characters and situations without altering the main story.This film, with its excellent acting (for which Jane Alexander earned an Oscar nomination) and a beautiful, simple yet haunting score by James Horner, is different from all of the other Cold War/Nuclear Holocaust films.  It's a story of a family and community coming together.  There is no magic pill that saves everybody in the end; there is no squad of commandos rushing in to defeat the evil Ruskies.  What IS there is a sense of connection with this ordinary family (particularly Ms. Alexander) as they survive what has happened and ask themselves, &quot;Why was I saved?  Why was I allowed to live when so many others died?&quot;.  This is not a date movie, not a movie for an evening of brainless entertainment.

The TV broadcaster goes on to say that ""radar sources confirm the explosion of nuclear devices in New York and up and down the East Coast.

For days afterward, I had this melancholy feeling that would not go away.Testament is a quiet and dignified film about a family living in a town near San Francisco in the aftermath of an unexplained nuclear attack on the United States (I'm assuming by the former Soviet Union).  There are no depictions of the nuclear attack other than a flash of light in the film.  Nor is any explanation given on the reason why there was a nuclear attack.  You do find out in the film from the town's Ham radio operator, that the the entire San Francisco Bay area is out, up north (Portland, OR?, Seattle, WA? Canada?)are ok, and that there is no communication east of the Mississippi River.Needless to say there isn't a happy ending, but the film does end on a somewhat hopeful note.  I also found the film score to be haunting, especially so, as the movie ends with it playing while a Wetherly family home movie is being played of the husband/father's (played by William Devane) birthday party.Be sure to look for Kevin Costner's and Rebecca De Mornay's cameo roles.

213780,A1USQH50ILYFZG,6300214575,Jon Nelson,"[5, 7]","Wow. This movie is simple and yet so heartbreaking, and it's sad to know that so few people have ever heard of it. Jane Alexander is what makes this movie; her performance is commanding and unforgettable. This is not to slight the other actors, especially Roxanna Zal, Ross Harris, Lukas Haas, and Philip Anglim, who all give incredible performances, but even in scenes where Alexander has no dialogue (for example, the scene in the church with all the townspeople), her presence is felt. This film is not perfect, and the beginning is rather monotonous, which is no doubt intentional, but there are a number of truly haunting and heartbreaking scenes that will linger with you long after the film is over. The extras on the dvd are also nice, with present day interviews with the main cast and filmmakers and interesting tidbits about the making of the film. It's interesting to see Jane, Roxanna, Ross, and Lukas as they look 20 years after the movie, and Kevin Costner is also interviewed, as well.

213781,A2DSXA1E02C86D,6300214575,Joseph Haschka,"[153, 158]","Two anti-war films were released in 1983:The Day Afterand TESTAMENT. The former, released in the US as a made-for-TV movie, was visually sensational: missile launches, mushroom clouds, disfigured survivors, urban landscapes turned debris fields. However, the latter illustrates the notion that an understatement can sometimes be more compelling.In TESTAMENT, Jane Alexander plays Carol Wetherly, the wife and mother of a 5-member family living in rural suburbia somewhere near Central California's Bay Area. Husband William Devane is off in San Francisco, never to return,  the day the Soviet  H-bomb falls upon it. Jane's character is left to manage alone the family's survival as their community, otherwise untouched directly by blast damage, copes with post-Holocaust disintegration. While some friends and neighbors leave the area for parts unknown, the Wetherlys remain.TESTAMENT is not graphic in its depiction of nuclear war's devastation. What makes it absolutely compelling is the vision of a community, much like mine and possibly yours, and a particular family, everyday folks like you and me, facing the insidious effects of starvation and radiation sickness as they descend into the darkness necessarily to follow a nuclear exchange between superpowers.  Ms. Alexander's performance is soul-wrenching and powerful, as when she cries out for God's damnation of those politicians that have reduced her world to an endless horror.TESTAMENT is not a feel-good film, but certainly a great one. It's an exercise in bleak despair, and one which ultimately focuses on nothing more than the basic human instinct to survive - the final tribute to a species that has engineered the means for its own destruction.",5,Displays the sometime power of an understatement,976406400,"12 10, 2000",2000,1714,"['Two', 'anti-war', 'films', 'were', 'released', '1983', 'Day', 'Afterand', 'TESTAMENT', 'former', 'released', 'US', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'was', 'visually', 'sensational', 'missile', 'launches', 'mushroom', 'clouds', 'disfigured', 'survivors', 'urban', 'landscapes', 'turned', 'debris', 'fields', 'However', 'latter', 'notion', 'understatement', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'more', 'compelling.In', 'TESTAMENT', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'Carol', 'Wetherly', 'wife', 'mother', '5-member', 'family', 'living', 'rural', 'suburbia', 'somewhere', 'Central', 'California', 'Bay', 'Area', 'Husband', 'William', 'Devane', 'San', 'Francisco', 'never', 'return', 'day', 'Soviet', 'H-bomb', 'Jane', 'character', 'left', 'manage', 'alone', 'family', 'survival', 'community', 'otherwise', 'untouched', 'directly', 'blast', 'damage', 'copes', 'post-Holocaust', 'disintegration', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'leave', 'area', 'parts', 'unknown', 'Wetherlys', 'remain.TESTAMENT', 'not', 'graphic', 'depiction', 'nuclear', 'war', 'devastation', 'What', 'absolutely', 'compelling', 'vision', 'community', 'much', 'mine', 'possibly', 'yours', 'particular', 'family', 'everyday', 'folks', 'facing', 'insidious', 'effects', 'starvation', 'radiation', 'sickness', 'descend', 'darkness', 'necessarily', 'follow', 'nuclear', 'exchange', 'superpowers', 'Ms.', 'Alexander', 'performance', 'soul-wrenching', 'powerful', 'when', 'out', 'God', 'damnation', 'politicians', 'have', 'reduced', 'world', 'endless', 'horror.TESTAMENT', 'not', 'feel-good', 'film', 'certainly', 'great', 'one', 'exercise', 'bleak', 'despair', 'one', 'ultimately', 'nothing', 'more', 'basic', 'human', 'instinct', 'survive', 'final', 'tribute', 'species', 'engineered', 'means', 'own', 'destruction']",Testament VHS

Sometimes, I think it's *the* best film; other times, I shudder at its perfect reality.I saw Testament in full 70mm in the dark of the late, lamented the William's Center Cinema.  There were maybe twenty of us in the audience that day.  The profound story of a woman and her three children *living* in the shadow of a mushroom cloud in mythical Hamlin, California, touched me deeply.  Back then, we didn't live with Dirty Bombs; we were children of the atomic age.  I remember crying out in pain, when the daughter wasn't allowed to give a stray cat food. Precious Food.  Canned Food that wouldn't save anybody and was only prolonging the inevitable.  The woman adopts two children whose parents died -- one is a child with Downs -- even as she watches her daughter and youngest son succumb to radiation poisoning.  Her eldest son spends his days helping others. This family *more* than survives, while the community of Hamlin comes together and then steadily falls apart.When the film ended, the entire audience remained seated and silent. Nobody moved for a long, long time.  We were *changed.*  We walked outside into the warm, blue-sky day and every single one of us *shivered...*Testament asks us to remember everything -- the good *and* the bad, equally.  It asks us to *more* than survive in the face of adversity.  It belongs in every serious DVD collection.(PS-- If you and I are together in a disaster, I'm sharing Precious Food with my Service Dog.

213784,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6300214575,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[76, 78]","""Testament"" is the most intimate and arguably the most disturbing of the films made in the early 1980s dealing with the aftermath of a nuclear war.  ""The Day After,"" which also aired in 1983, is the most obvious example, but there was also ""Special Bulletin"" (1983), the BBC-produced ""Threads"" (1984), the animated ""When the Wind Blows"" (1986), and a Soviet film the title of which escapes me at the moment.  Unlike the rest of those films, there are no harrowing scenes of nuclear explosions or people ravaged by radiation sickness.  In that regard, ""Testament"" is almost naive; radiation sickness is nothing more than dark shadows around the eyes of the characters.  But this is not a movie about special effects; the nuclear war consists of nothing more than a bright light outside the window with telephones and televisions suddenly going dead (the film is set in Hamlin, a small California town not far from San Francisco, the obvious target).  The rhyme and reason for the war is of no consequence in the final analysis.  Instead, this is a story about facing the end of the world, recalling the film ""On the Beach"" (1959) more than any other work in this genre.Based on ""The Last Testament"" by Carol Amen, the ""Testament"" script is by John Sacret Young, who would later create the television series ""China Beach,"" and offer many moments of subtle lyricism despite the subject matter.  The focus is on the family of Carol Wetherly (Jane Alexnader), whose husband Tom (William Devane) went off to work that morning and never came back.  The Wetherly's have three children, Brad (Rossie Harris), Mary Liz (Roxana Zal), and Scottie (Lukas Haas), and it is what happens to them after the bombs go after that affects us over the course of this 90-minute film.  Death is inevitable in this film, and ultimately the question is how it should be faced.  Director Lynne Littman provides scenes that become unforgettable because of their simple eloquence, most notable, one in which Carol finishes sewing up the shroud in which she has wrapped one of her children.This is one of the most upsetting films I have ever seen in my life.  It took me a while to be able to watch it a second time, and that was because I was working on a presentation involving nuclear war films.  But watching it again was so superflous because the film was seared into my mind after watching it the first time.  Alexander's performance, as you would expect, is superb, but it is Zal (who was equally good in ""Something About Amelia"") who is the most poignant figure in the story.  Only once does the film threaten to break away from its pedestrian boundaries, when the school kids put on a play about the ""Pied Piper of Hamelin"" (remember the town's name is Hamlin), but even here the anger is submerged in the sadness of the presentation.  Watching ""Testament"" is a very upsetting experience because at the end it is impossible to avoid asking yourself a horrifying question...what would you do in Carol's place?",5,The most disturbing film about surviving a nuclear holocaust,1038787200,"12 2, 2002",2002,2987,"['Testament', 'most', 'intimate', 'arguably', 'most', 'disturbing', 'films', 'made', 'early', '1980s', 'dealing', 'aftermath', 'nuclear', 'war', 'Day', 'also', 'aired', '1983', 'most', 'obvious', 'example', 'was', 'also', 'Special', 'Bulletin', '1983', 'BBC-produced', 'Threads', '1984', 'animated', 'When', 'Wind', 'Blows', '1986', 'Soviet', 'film', 'title', 'moment', 'rest', 'films', 'are', 'harrowing', 'scenes', 'nuclear', 'explosions', 'people', 'ravaged', 'radiation', 'sickness', 'regard', 'Testament', 'almost', 'naive', 'radiation', 'sickness', 'nothing', 'more', 'dark', 'shadows', 'eyes', 'characters', 'not', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'nuclear', 'war', 'nothing', 'more', 'bright', 'light', 'window', 'telephones', 'televisions', 'suddenly', 'going', 'dead', 'film', 'set', 'Hamlin', 'small', 'California', 'town', 'not', 'far', 'San', 'Francisco', 'obvious', 'target', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'war', 'consequence', 'final', 'analysis', 'Instead', 'story', 'facing', 'end', 'world', 'recalling', 'film', 'Beach', '1959', 'more', 'other', 'work', 'genre.Based', 'Last', 'Testament', 'Carol', 'Amen', 'Testament', 'script', 'John', 'Sacret', 'Young', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'create', 'television', 'series', 'China', 'Beach', 'offer', 'many', 'moments', 'subtle', 'lyricism', 'subject', 'matter', 'focus', 'family', 'Carol', 'Wetherly', 'Jane', 'Alexnader', 'husband', 'Tom', 'William', 'Devane', 'went', 'work', 'morning', 'never', 'came', 'back', 'Wetherly', 'have', 'three', 'children', 'Brad', 'Rossie', 'Harris', 'Mary', 'Liz', 'Roxana', 'Zal', 'Scottie', 'Lukas', 'Haas', 'what', 'bombs', 'go', 'course', '90-minute', 'film', 'Death', 'inevitable', 'film', 'ultimately', 'question', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'faced', 'Director', 'Lynne', 'Littman', 'scenes', 'become', 'unforgettable', 'simple', 'eloquence', 'most', 'notable', 'one', 'Carol', 'finishes', 'sewing', 'up', 'shroud', 'wrapped', 'one', 'children.This', 'one', 'most', 'upsetting', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'took', 'while', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'was', 'was', 'working', 'presentation', 'involving', 'nuclear', 'war', 'films', 'watching', 'again', 'was', 'so', 'superflous', 'film', 'was', 'seared', 'mind', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'Alexander', 'performance', 'would', 'expect', 'superb', 'Zal', 'who', 'was', 'equally', 'good', 'Something', 'About', 'Amelia', 'who', 'most', 'poignant', 'figure', 'story', 'Only', 'once', 'film', 'threaten', 'break', 'away', 'pedestrian', 'boundaries', 'when', 'school', 'kids', 'put', 'play', 'Pied', 'Piper', 'Hamelin', 'remember', 'town', 'name', 'Hamlin', 'even', 'here', 'anger', 'submerged', 'sadness', 'presentation', 'Watching', 'Testament', 'very', 'upsetting', 'experience', 'end', 'impossible', 'avoid', 'asking', 'horrifying', 'question', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'Carol', 'place']",Testament VHS

This was not drama for the sake of entertainment, it was the very realistic illustration of the fragility of our society, how quickly everything we love so deeply could be taken away from us with absolutely no excuse or explanation. It also portrayed very well the strength of the human spirit, how people tried so hard to go on with some semblance of routine and meaning to their lives, knowing they too had only days or weeks to live.

Throughout the movie you don't know what has happened to other people in the country, who attacked them, or if there is anyone out there who will be able to pull everything back together.

It actually was commissioned as an episode of PBS's American Playhouse.  When it was finished, PBS thought that it was too good for television and released it in movie theaters.  It was a major hit and garnered Jane Alexander a Best Actress Oscar nomination (she should have won).  The second breakthrough was the first film to deal with a nuclear attack from the survivor's point of view without saying who sent the missiles or bomb.  All other films before that and even after assigned blame, this did not care what the cause was just the effect.Hamelin, California is a small suburb of San Francisco.  It is a typical small town of any large city.  The Wetherly's are a typical suburban family with father Tom (William DeVane) and mother Carol (Jane Alexander).  They have three children, the oldest Mary Liz (Roxana Zal), the middle child Brad (Brad Harris) and the baby Scottie (Lucas Haas).  The family has their problems but nothing too crucial or untypical for suburban family.  You might expect this to be a film about adultery or a family coping with loss.  But this is a film about something more compelling.The family is watching TV when an alert comes on just saying that nuclear bombs have been exploded on the east coast.  Then a bright flash occurs.  No one knows what happened for sure.  The community is confused but everyone is okay.  Then they go into survival mode.Two weeks have past and those remaining try to restore normal life.  But the fallout is starting to have its effects on the population.  Survival turns to desperation then to despair.  People continue to die.  The first in the family to show signs is Scottie and he goes first.  Larry, a neighbor kid that was staying with them is next.  He is then followed Mary Liz.Hiroshi's father leaves and Brad brings him home.  Things are getting bleaker Carol is showing signs and so is Brad.  They decide to end it but cannot carry it through.  The film ends on Brad's birthday (2 months from the explosion) with a note of hope.This is a film of little moments.  When the family goes to get gas, Mike (Mako) tells them that it's free to regulars.  Carol invites him and his son to dinner to repay.  Mike tells he has been repaid many times by her family's kindness. The school play, The Pied Piper of Hamlin, is performed with all the children being taken away.  There is a devastating scene where Mary Liz asks her mother about love knowing that she will never experience it.I saw this in the theater and was blown away by this film and it is just a potent on television.It's also interesting to see some early work by future stars like Kevin Costner and Rebecca DeMornay as newlyweds with a baby and Philip Anghlim, fresh off his Tony Award as the Elephant Man, as the pastor.  William DeVane as the father had success in television movies in the 70's but would not gain fame until Knot's Landing a few years away.And the film has character performances by some great older actors like Lilia Skala (Oscar nominee of Lilies of the Field), Leon Ames (Mr. Ed) and Mako (Oscar nominee for Sand Pebbles and founder of East/West Players).By the way, The Day After got much more publicity when it aired on television but this film is 100 time better.DVD EXTRAS:Testament at 20 - Cast reunion of Lucas Hass, Roxanne Zal, Brad Harris with director Lynne Littman twenty years after making the film with interspersed with interviews with star Jane Alexander, featured actor Kevin Costner, writer John Sacret Young, cinematographer Steven Poster, composer James Horner and others.  This is a making of film with a lookback.  Many of these featurettes are made at the time of the movie and are just promotional material.  Being made 20 years later and the cast is all alive, gives this more depth.Testament: Nuclear Thoughts - This is a 13 minute anti nuclear short that, while provides food for thought, is so one sided that it loses credibility.Timeline of the Nuclear Age -  A three minute written essay on nuclear bombs from the early tests to 2004.",5,The Best Film About Nuclear War,1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,4073,"['Testament', 'was', 'breakthrough', 'movie', 'two', 'reasons', 'actually', 'was', 'commissioned', 'episode', 'PBS', 'American', 'Playhouse', 'When', 'was', 'finished', 'PBS', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'good', 'television', 'released', 'movie', 'theaters', 'was', 'major', 'hit', 'garnered', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'second', 'breakthrough', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'deal', 'nuclear', 'attack', 'survivor', 'point', 'view', 'saying', 'who', 'sent', 'missiles', 'bomb', 'other', 'films', 'even', 'assigned', 'blame', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'what', 'cause', 'was', 'just', 'effect.Hamelin', 'California', 'small', 'suburb', 'San', 'Francisco', 'typical', 'small', 'town', 'large', 'city', 'Wetherly', 'are', 'typical', 'suburban', 'family', 'father', 'Tom', 'William', 'DeVane', 'Carol', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'have', 'three', 'children', 'oldest', 'Mary', 'Liz', 'Roxana', 'Zal', 'middle', 'child', 'Brad', 'Brad', 'Harris', 'baby', 'Scottie', 'Lucas', 'Haas', 'family', 'problems', 'nothing', 'too', 'crucial', 'untypical', 'suburban', 'family', 'might', 'expect', 'be', 'film', 'adultery', 'family', 'coping', 'loss', 'film', 'something', 'more', 'compelling.The', 'family', 'watching', 'TV', 'when', 'alert', 'just', 'saying', 'nuclear', 'bombs', 'have', 'been', 'exploded', 'east', 'coast', 'Then', 'bright', 'flash', 'occurs', 'one', 'what', 'happened', 'sure', 'community', 'confused', 'everyone', 'okay', 'Then', 'go', 'survival', 'mode.Two', 'weeks', 'have', 'past', 'remaining', 'try', 'restore', 'normal', 'life', 'fallout', 'starting', 'have', 'effects', 'population', 'Survival', 'desperation', 'then', 'despair', 'People', 'continue', 'die', 'first', 'family', 'show', 'signs', 'Scottie', 'first', 'Larry', 'neighbor', 'kid', 'was', 'staying', 'next', 'then', 'followed', 'Mary', 'Liz.Hiroshi', 'father', 'Brad', 'home', 'Things', 'are', 'getting', 'bleaker', 'Carol', 'showing', 'signs', 'so', 'Brad', 'decide', 'end', 'can', 'not', 'carry', 'film', 'Brad', 'birthday', '2', 'months', 'explosion', 'note', 'hope.This', 'film', 'little', 'moments', 'When', 'family', 'get', 'gas', 'Mike', 'Mako', 'free', 'regulars', 'Carol', 'son', 'dinner', 'repay', 'Mike', 'been', 'repaid', 'many', 'times', 'family', 'kindness', 'school', 'play', 'Pied', 'Piper', 'Hamlin', 'performed', 'children', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'devastating', 'scene', 'where', 'Mary', 'Liz', 'mother', 'love', 'knowing', 'will', 'never', 'experience', 'it.I', 'saw', 'theater', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'film', 'just', 'potent', 'television.It', 'also', 'interesting', 'see', 'early', 'work', 'future', 'stars', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Rebecca', 'DeMornay', 'newlyweds', 'baby', 'Philip', 'Anghlim', 'fresh', 'off', 'Tony', 'Award', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'pastor', 'William', 'DeVane', 'father', 'had', 'success', 'television', 'movies', '70', 'would', 'not', 'gain', 'fame', 'Knot', 'Landing', 'few', 'years', 'away.And', 'film', 'character', 'performances', 'great', 'older', 'actors', 'Lilia', 'Skala', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Lilies', 'Field', 'Leon', 'Ames', 'Mr.', 'Ed', 'Mako', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Sand', 'Pebbles', 'founder', 'East/West', 'Players', '.By', 'way', 'Day', 'got', 'much', 'more', 'publicity', 'when', 'aired', 'television', 'film', '100', 'time', 'better.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'Testament', '20', 'Cast', 'reunion', 'Lucas', 'Hass', 'Roxanne', 'Zal', 'Brad', 'Harris', 'director', 'Lynne', 'Littman', 'twenty', 'years', 'making', 'film', 'interspersed', 'interviews', 'star', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'featured', 'actor', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'writer', 'John', 'Sacret', 'Young', 'cinematographer', 'Steven', 'Poster', 'composer', 'James', 'Horner', 'others', 'making', 'film', 'lookback', 'Many', 'featurettes', 'are', 'made', 'time', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'promotional', 'material', 'Being', 'made', '20', 'years', 'later', 'cast', 'alive', 'more', 'depth.Testament', 'Nuclear', 'Thoughts', '13', 'minute', 'anti', 'nuclear', 'short', 'food', 'thought', 'so', 'one', 'sided', 'credibility.Timeline', 'Nuclear', 'Age', 'three', 'minute', 'written', 'essay', 'nuclear', 'bombs', 'early', 'tests', '2004']",Testament VHS
213792,A2EWC48FRNO3YP,6300214575,"M. Veiluva ""sputnik99""","[7, 9]","I saw the theatrically-released version of &quot;Testament&quot; in Berkeley California in the early 1980s.  This was the era of the Nuclear Freeze and huge mass demonstrations against the Reagan government's unprecedented nuclear arms build-up.  In the midst of all this landed &quot;Testament&quot;, which is by leaps and bounds the most harrowing (and depressing) of any film dealing with nuclear war.  After the movie, groups of people just huddled together outside, many weeping.  This is strong medicine.The movie is so sad it is almost unwatchable.  The film follows one family's experience in a small Northern California town.  Jane Alexander, future head and defender of the National Endowment for the Arts, plays the mother, alone with three school-age children,  There are no fancy special effects; the bomb is a bright light through the window.Somehow everyone has to keep going.  One by one, people begin to miss work, students stop showing up at school.  When a banana appears, you know its the last one, ever.  The film's effectiveness is that we get to know the family and town, they are  just ordinary people, and Alexander is a terrific Everymom.  The school play scene is just about the saddist thing you will ever see on film.The movie came out about the same time as the made-for TV, much hearalded ABC's &quot;The Day After&quot; which wowed with special effects and big-name stars, but suffered from poor character development.  This movie is the opposite - we care too much about these people.My friend (an anti-nuclear activist)who was with me at the theater surprised me by saying she thought the movie was calculating and manipulative.  I have not made up my mind.  Also, with the immediacy of nuclear war somewhat dimmed since the early 1980s, I'm not sure the movie will have the same impact.Also in the same serious genre:  &quot;The War Game&quot; and &quot;Threads&quot;, which are British productions.  &quot;Testmanet&quot; is the better of the three.",4,Anti-nuclear war film hits hard and personal,1066176000,"10 15, 2003",2003,1985,"['saw', 'theatrically-released', 'version', 'quot', 'Testament', 'quot', 'Berkeley', 'California', 'early', '1980s', 'was', 'era', 'Nuclear', 'Freeze', 'huge', 'mass', 'demonstrations', 'Reagan', 'government', 'unprecedented', 'nuclear', 'arms', 'build-up', 'midst', 'landed', 'quot', 'Testament', 'quot', 'leaps', 'most', 'harrowing', 'depressing', 'film', 'dealing', 'nuclear', 'war', 'movie', 'groups', 'people', 'just', 'huddled', 'together', 'outside', 'many', 'weeping', 'strong', 'medicine.The', 'movie', 'so', 'sad', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'film', 'one', 'family', 'experience', 'small', 'Northern', 'California', 'town', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'future', 'head', 'defender', 'National', 'Endowment', 'Arts', 'mother', 'alone', 'three', 'school-age', 'children', 'are', 'fancy', 'special', 'effects', 'bomb', 'bright', 'light', 'window.Somehow', 'everyone', 'keep', 'going', 'One', 'one', 'people', 'begin', 'miss', 'work', 'students', 'stop', 'showing', 'up', 'school', 'When', 'banana', 'know', 'last', 'one', 'ever', 'film', 'effectiveness', 'get', 'know', 'family', 'town', 'are', 'just', 'ordinary', 'people', 'Alexander', 'terrific', 'Everymom', 'school', 'play', 'scene', 'just', 'saddist', 'thing', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'film.The', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'made-for', 'TV', 'much', 'hearalded', 'ABC', 'quot', 'Day', 'quot', 'wowed', 'special', 'effects', 'big-name', 'stars', 'suffered', 'poor', 'character', 'development', 'movie', 'opposite', 'care', 'too', 'much', 'people.My', 'friend', 'anti-nuclear', 'activist', 'who', 'was', 'theater', 'surprised', 'saying', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'calculating', 'manipulative', 'have', 'not', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'Also', 'immediacy', 'nuclear', 'war', 'somewhat', 'dimmed', 'early', '1980s', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'same', 'impact.Also', 'same', 'serious', 'genre', 'quot', 'War', 'Game', 'quot', 'quot', 'Threads', 'quot', 'are', 'British', 'productions', 'quot', 'Testmanet', 'quot', 'better', 'three']",Testament VHS

Its been a long time coming but I am so excited to see this make it finally to the DVD format.Let me tell all of you that this movie was a masterpiece.  I saw it back in the early 80s on PBS TV and it just rocked me to the core.  IM telling you people this movie is so powerful you will never be the same after watching it!Its about a family living a typical life of experiences and activities.  They live in the suburbs of San Francisco Bay Area - the father goes off to work in San Francisco.  The kids are watching cartoons after school and then hell is unleashed upon all!  The TV is interrupted by news anchor notifying the entire eastern seaboard has been hit by nuclear missiles.  A flash explodes in the living room and a air raid siren blasts....The story begins....we suffer through the agony and hopelessness as the mother tries to do the best she can to get her family (daughter and 2 sons) to go about their daily lives.You become so emotionally connected to the characters and their feelings that it becomes utterly painful to see the aftermath destruction of nuclear war via radiation and apocalypse.You will cry till there's no tommorow when you see the family slowly die one by one.  Its a feeling I've not experienced watching television or movies.  The acting is so beautiful and authentic you can forget you are watching a tv screen and think you are seeing a live performance.I am so happy to see this come out on DVD it is really a wake up call to human beings as they will appreciate life and the world we live in as opposed to nuclear holocaust that is out there.Please understand this movie is so depressing that you may need help to recover from it but its a fictional tale that hopefully never comes true.  Buy and see this movie as soon as you can because it will be a life changing experience for you - I have no doubt!,5,"Most Powerful, impacting, emotional films ever made!",1097798400,"10 15, 2004",2004,1902,"['Oh', 'boy', '.here', 'go', 'testament', 'arrived', 'DVD', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'coming', 'am', 'so', 'excited', 'see', 'make', 'finally', 'DVD', 'format.Let', 'tell', 'movie', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'saw', 'back', 'early', '80s', 'PBS', 'TV', 'just', 'rocked', 'core', 'IM', 'telling', 'people', 'movie', 'so', 'powerful', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'watching', 'family', 'living', 'typical', 'life', 'experiences', 'activities', 'live', 'suburbs', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bay', 'Area', 'father', 'work', 'San', 'Francisco', 'kids', 'are', 'watching', 'cartoons', 'school', 'then', 'hell', 'unleashed', 'TV', 'interrupted', 'news', 'anchor', 'notifying', 'entire', 'eastern', 'seaboard', 'been', 'hit', 'nuclear', 'missiles', 'flash', 'explodes', 'living', 'room', 'air', 'raid', 'siren', 'blasts', '.The', 'story', 'begins', '.we', 'suffer', 'agony', 'hopelessness', 'mother', 'tries', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'get', 'family', 'daughter', '2', 'sons', 'go', 'daily', 'become', 'so', 'emotionally', 'connected', 'characters', 'feelings', 'utterly', 'painful', 'see', 'aftermath', 'destruction', 'nuclear', 'war', 'radiation', 'apocalypse.You', 'will', 'cry', 'till', 'tommorow', 'when', 'see', 'family', 'slowly', 'die', 'one', 'one', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'not', 'experienced', 'watching', 'television', 'movies', 'acting', 'so', 'beautiful', 'authentic', 'can', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'tv', 'screen', 'think', 'are', 'seeing', 'live', 'performance.I', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'see', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'really', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'human', 'beings', 'will', 'appreciate', 'life', 'world', 'live', 'as', 'opposed', 'nuclear', 'holocaust', 'out', 'there.Please', 'understand', 'movie', 'so', 'depressing', 'may', 'need', 'help', 'recover', 'fictional', 'tale', 'hopefully', 'never', 'true', 'Buy', 'see', 'movie', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'because', 'will', 'be', 'life', 'changing', 'experience', 'have', 'doubt']",Testament VHS

I thought, ""boy, now I have to see THAT movie!""The two films are similar in that they are about the aftermath of a global nuclear disaster and what happens to a group of people as they wait for, and finally succumb to, radiation poisoning. That's where the similarities end.On The Beach has a compelling plot with interesting characters, great music, and cinematography. In Testament, we watch as spoiled suburbanites die off one by one. It's depressing. The people are boring and not particularly likable or sympathetic. The uncreative cinematography is boring. Using a grainy home movie effect to signify memories is trite, hackneyed, and over-used. In On The Beach, the characters figure out how to make the most of the time they have left. In Testament, they give up, wander around like zombies, don't bother to educate themselves or think about survival. Instead, they fight over food, water, and video games so they can prolong their agonizingly slow deaths.I can usually understand why others enjoyed a movie, even if I didn't like it. In this case, I am totally mystified. I feel emotions and cry watching On The Beach and lots of other great films. I'm appalled and a bit ashamed to confess that watching people die in Testament was like watching paint dry and the only emotion I felt was boredom.When I saw On the Beach years ago, I thought, ""if this ever happens, I hope one of the missiles is a direct hit on my head, cuz I want to die quickly."" Watching Testament I thought, ""if this ever happens, and a missile doesn't hit me on the head, I'll take my gun and shoot myself.""",2,Depressing and Slow,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,1822,"['paid', '4.00', 'stream', 'film', 'negative', 'review', 'truly', 'great', 'film', '1959', 'Beach', 'stated', 'Beach', 'was', 'boring', 'slow', 'Testament', 'truly', 'great', 'realistic', 'film', 'nuclear', 'holocaust', 'thought', 'boy', 'now', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'similar', 'are', 'aftermath', 'global', 'nuclear', 'disaster', 'what', 'group', 'people', 'wait', 'finally', 'succumb', 'radiation', 'poisoning', 'where', 'similarities', 'end.On', 'Beach', 'compelling', 'plot', 'interesting', 'characters', 'great', 'music', 'cinematography', 'Testament', 'watch', 'spoiled', 'suburbanites', 'die', 'one', 'one', 'depressing', 'people', 'are', 'boring', 'not', 'particularly', 'likable', 'sympathetic', 'uncreative', 'cinematography', 'boring', 'Using', 'grainy', 'home', 'movie', 'effect', 'signify', 'memories', 'trite', 'hackneyed', 'over-used', 'Beach', 'characters', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'make', 'most', 'time', 'have', 'left', 'Testament', 'give', 'up', 'wander', 'zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'educate', 'think', 'survival', 'Instead', 'fight', 'food', 'water', 'video', 'games', 'can', 'prolong', 'agonizingly', 'slow', 'deaths.I', 'can', 'usually', 'understand', 'why', 'others', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'case', 'am', 'totally', 'mystified', 'feel', 'emotions', 'cry', 'watching', 'Beach', 'lots', 'other', 'great', 'films', ""'m"", 'appalled', 'bit', 'ashamed', 'confess', 'watching', 'people', 'die', 'Testament', 'was', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry', 'only', 'emotion', 'felt', 'was', 'boredom.When', 'saw', 'Beach', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', 'ever', 'hope', 'one', 'missiles', 'direct', 'hit', 'head', 'cuz', 'want', 'die', 'quickly', 'Watching', 'Testament', 'thought', 'ever', 'missile', ""n't"", 'hit', 'head', ""'ll"", 'take', 'gun', 'shoot']",Testament VHS

Bayerl ""Specialist in having fun""","[3, 4]","This film has been a favorite of mine for some time, especially since I lived under the nuclear shadow in its heyday, which came to a particular head in the 1980s.  Besides following the strained yet adamantly coherent progress of a middle American family through the 3 months after someone (we don't know who, or even if it was &quot;their&quot; first strike) attacks the larger centers of the US with nuclear devices.  Indeed, the political aspect is of no concern to the viewpoint of the film, except as the local authorities slowly lose hold in the northern CA town of Hamlin.  We see Jane Alexander attempting as best she can to maintain a sense of continuity, and her children appear to respond in a meaningful way, even as they begin to succumb to the hidden but ever-present antagonist, the radioactive fallout.  With little certainty except that of further decline, the ones who succeed are, ironically, the ones who concede that they can only carry out small actions of their own.  The film does have some trouble with technical details (e.g., why is it that radio amateur W6DN's transistors are all blown by electromagnetic pulse but not the ones in the tape recorder, spelling tutor and answering machine?), and the overall feel of the presentation, as in the musical accompaniment, make it feel like a made-for-TV special one might see on Lifetime or PBS, the viewer is still given a powerful image that the idealogues of the time would not or could not admit to the public they served.

Surrounding them are various other members of the town who were also excellent casting decisions; Mike, the gas station guy (Mako, recently in the TV series Black Mask and as the bad guy in a host of gung-ho movies like Pearl Harbor and Bulletproof Monk) and the Pitkins (Kevin Costner and Rebecca DeMornay, both just starting out) were examples of the incredible job Marjorie Simkin did casting this movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't change the fact that, well, the world doesn't blow up. It's hard to have a nuclear holocaust movie without a nuclear holocaust.What you're left with is a proto-Lifetime Original Movie, a psychodrama about a family who's lost their father in a terrible accident; this particular accident just happens to have wiped out San Francisco (in other words, set it in a different time period and this could easily be an earthquake flick). Looked at from that perspective, it's miles better than your typical LOM, but in comparison to the other films in its genre-- especially Threads and The Day After, the yardsticks by which nuclear-war films have been measured for twenty years-- Testament doesn't really make the cut.The Lifetime Movie Channel, however, should they ever discover it, will get years of retread mileage out of this flick.

Jane Alexander gives an excellent performance as a mother trying to carry on after the most devastating of events.  Perhaps limited by budget, we don't see any gruesome special effects, over-wrought portrayals of screaming mobs, or even an over-blown breakdown of society version in this movie.And that's a good thing.  By concentrating on character, the movie really packs a punch.  We can really identify with the family who isn't even sure the father of the family, who may or may not have gone into the blast zone, is alive.The theme of the movie, an unbelievable cataclysmic event that kills millions (or billions), is as topical as ever, with the continued proliferation of nuclear weapons.  Not to mention the specter of bio-terrorism with its threat of an uncontained plague.One comment I just have to make about the 'editorial review' in this case.  The small town in question is just north of San Francisco.  Sorry, but California isn't the 'Pacific Northwest'.Thank goodness this is finally out on DVD.

Tension, fleeting anxiety, and there's enjoyment in watching horrible things you'll (hopefully) never see otherwise. But there's a detachment, as well. We may wince and empathize with a character's plight, but as credits roll our participation rapidly wanes. It's not real, it's only a movie.TESTAMENT is real. Littman's PBS film is far more chilling, pervasive, and in the end, effective. ""This is a movie about sheets,"" Littman observes in one of the extras. No mushroom clouds, no buildings collapse, no riots. And yet the urge to write your political representatives (or take up a picket line) is nearly unshakeable.Good picture and sound quality with the DVD release, and an excellent set of extras accompany the film.""Testament at 20"" is a well-done, twenty-years-later retrospective by Littman with the principal cast and crew. Of note: Rossie Harris (""Brad,"" the oldest son) discusses his scenes with ""Hiroshi""; Roxanne Zal, her character's inquiry into adult matters; and Lukas Haas reads the letter he wrote to President Reagan at the time.""Nuclear Thoughts"" centers around airing the film to a small group of teens and their discussions afterward. Eerily poignant are the young man who disowns responsibility since no law labels the choice of nuclear exchange as bad, and the young woman so distraught over a girl's death and the mother's anguish who nonetheless keeps referring to the girl's body as ""it.""""Timeline of the Nuclear Age"" is a text crawl of milestones, from the inception of the Manhattan Project through 2004. The United States' withdrawal from nuclear regulation of late is hard to miss.Next time you cue up TERMINATOR, INDEPENDENCE DAY, THE DAY AFTER, or even THE DAY AFTER TOMMOROW, enjoy the disaster in all its artistry, but make it a double-bill and follow-up with a viewing of TESTAMENT.

Smith ""ltcolkiranerys""","[5, 7]","Testament has always been one of my favorite movies, and when the chance came to get it on DVD, I jumped at it.In this movie, Jane Alexander plays Carol Wetherly, a harried suburban housewife whose husband (William Devane) is out of town when her world is shattered by a nuclear attack.  Unable to contact him, Mrs. Wetherly is forced to nurse her two eldest children as they succumb to the effects of nuclear radiation while the world is falling apart all around them, as well as confronting her own mortality.  Kevin Costner and Rebecca DeMornay also give surprisingly good performances as a young couple of Carol's acquaintance who, after losing their baby to the effects of the radiation, decide to pack up and move out of the area to escape.One of the things I like about this DVD is that the extras, though few in number, are very good and offer some insight into what the movie is all about.  Testament At 20 reunites the 3 principal actors (Alexander, Lukas Haas, and Roxana Zal) for a discussion about the making of the movie, interspersed with clips of interviews from director Lynne Littman, composer James Horner, and others involved in making the film.  Testament: Nuclear Thoughts is more of an educational documentary, with school students talking about the film and its impact on them interspersed with clips from director Lynne Littman and actress Jane Alexander.  There is also a text timeline that covers the entire nuclear age, from the earliest Manhattan Project experiments all the way through Operation Iraqi Freedom.Some people may say that Testament has become somewhat dated, but I still recommend it very highly.

I liked ""Threads"" and ""The Day After"", but this film is almost the antithesis to those films and is all the better for it. There are no scenes of monumental destruction, no sweeping fires or mushroom cloudes or scenes of the dead. Instead the approach is subtle and extremely emotional. While ""The Day After"" attemped to show the effects of nuclear war on the entire United States, ""Testament"" shows you one family. One family living in the suburbs and who anyone could relate to. You are drawn in emotionaly by connecting with each of the characters and by seeing and hearing only what they see and hear. After the attack they are left completely to themselves, nobody's coming to help them. They try to hold together with the other survivors in the community and at first it works, but as the effects of radiation and loss of life continue, this film becomes harder and harder to watch. As characters die for no reason other than radiation, that is when the film becomes so emotional that you can't help but watch it. This film forces you to put yourself in these people's situations and wonder what you might do in their place. This film is extremely depressing and that's where it becomes effective.

This movie does take a real look at grief, from the teddy bear cene to the birds and the bees scene. With all the threats of terrorism, I think this movie fits quite well with today's society. It made me feel like I had no control over protecting my daughter, and the sad truth is I wouldn't be able to save her. Duck and cover? Get out of here. They just say that so people feel like there's something they can do. I loved this movie, and thought it was very powerful. On the DVD they do interviews with the cast and crew 20 years later, and I enjoyed watching that.I don't think this is a movie I will ever forget, and I'm so glad I watched it. I just hope none of us ever has to live something like it.",5,Still makes sense,1225324800,"10 30, 2008",2008,1510,"['know', 'was', 'made', 'early', '80', 'was', 'born', 'late', '70', 'cold', 'war', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'time', 'i', 'was', 'grade', 'school', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'imdb', 'too', 'chance', 'renting', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did.The', 'story', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'out', 'info', 'what', 'country', 'did', 'attack', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'difference', 'anywhow', 'nice', 'normal', 'family', 'day', 'Dad', 'city', 'work', 'Mom', 'son', 'preschool', 'daughter', 'practices', 'piano', 'then', 'brightest', 'light', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'off', 'were', 'spared', 'explosion', 'not', 'fall', 'mother', 'found', 'story', 'so', 'sad', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'things', 'were', 'killing', 'family', 'were', 'totally', 'control', 'was', 'place', 'go', 'help', 'movie', 'take', 'real', 'look', 'grief', 'teddy', 'bear', 'cene', 'birds', 'bees', 'scene', 'threats', 'terrorism', 'think', 'movie', 'quite', 'well', 'today', 'society', 'made', 'feel', 'had', 'control', 'protecting', 'daughter', 'sad', 'truth', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'save', 'Duck', 'cover', 'Get', 'here', 'just', 'say', 'so', 'people', 'feel', 'something', 'can', 'do', 'loved', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'powerful', 'DVD', 'do', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', '20', 'years', 'later', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'that.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'ever', 'forget', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'watched', 'just', 'hope', 'none', 'ever', 'live', 'something']",Testament VHS
213809,A96K1ZGW56S2I,6300214575,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[10, 10]","There are some images from movies and television that I watched as a child that have been seared into my brain:  the Yankee soldier who wets himself before going into battle in THE BLUE AND THE GREY; the venomous snake that spooks the horses in a river crossing in LONESOME DOVE which ends up killing Ricky Schroeder's Irish friend; the masks that the kidnappers where in FORTRESS.  Added to these images are a couple more: that of the residents of a small town burning the bodies of their citizens from radiation poisoning after a nuclear holocaust because there is no place left to bury them and disease is spreading too fast and that of a young father (played by Kevin Costner) carrying the body of his newborn child in a dresser drawer to be buried.  These last two images are from the film TESTAMENT.TESTAMENT is the most powerful film about the aftermath of nuclear attack ever made.  It aired on television right around the time another movie about the aftermath of a nuclear war, THE DAY AFTER, aired.  THE DAY AFTER is kind of a special effects extravaganza complete with launching missiles, mushroom clouds, masses of people in hysteria, and makeup revealing rotting flesh and opens sores.  TESTAMENT is a much simpler film.  The atomic attack is represented by a bright flash of light and all telephones and televisions going dead.Jane Alexander portrays the central character of the story, Carol Wetherly, and she does so brilliantly.  Wetherly is a stay at home mom with three children and a wonderful husband named Tom (William Devane).  The Wetherlys live in the small town of Hamlin, CA--not too far outside of San Francisco.  Tom leaves for work on the day of the attack and never comes back.  The agony and suffering of this story is relayed ever so eloquently on the day after the attack as Carol realizes that Tom is never going to come back, a realization she eventually has to share with her children.  TESTAMENT illustrates just how the people of a small community might have to deal with a nuclear holocaust if it ever happened:  people burying their family members in their front yards, town meetings in one of the local churches that continue to drop in number as the days pass, people using HAM radios in attempt to contact someone somewhere, the struggle to find food, the frustration of wanting to leave but not being able to because of no fuel.Perhaps one of the reasons that TESTAMENT affected me so much is that I was raised in a small town and it made the threat of what a nuclear attack could do very real to me.  Many of the characters in the film reminded me of people I knew and I couldn't help but think to myself, what would I do in such a situation?  What would my Mom do?  Would we be able to survive?  Or would we die before our time?When the Cold War finally thawed in 1989 and finally ended less than a year later, TESTAMENT was forgotten by many people as a relic of the past.  I've never forgotten the film and its images have been seared into my mind since I was a child.  However, in the post-9/11 world in which we live, TESTAMENT is a film that is just as relevant as ever.  As haunting and disturbing as the film is, TESTAMENT is a film that every American should watch at least once.The DVD version of the film includes a couple of featurettes about the film as well as a timeline of the nuclear age.  I enjoyed the TESTAMENT AT 20 featurette the best because it was an honest reflection about the film with some of the principal actors.",5,Every American Should Watch This Movie.,1158019200,"09 12, 2006",2006,3489,"['are', 'images', 'movies', 'television', 'watched', 'child', 'have', 'been', 'seared', 'brain', 'Yankee', 'soldier', 'who', 'going', 'battle', 'THE', 'BLUE', 'AND', 'THE', 'GREY', 'venomous', 'snake', 'horses', 'river', 'crossing', 'LONESOME', 'DOVE', 'up', 'killing', 'Ricky', 'Schroeder', 'Irish', 'friend', 'masks', 'kidnappers', 'where', 'FORTRESS', 'Added', 'images', 'are', 'couple', 'more', 'residents', 'small', 'town', 'burning', 'bodies', 'citizens', 'radiation', 'poisoning', 'nuclear', 'holocaust', 'place', 'left', 'bury', 'disease', 'spreading', 'too', 'fast', 'young', 'father', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'carrying', 'body', 'newborn', 'child', 'dresser', 'drawer', 'be', 'buried', 'last', 'two', 'images', 'are', 'film', 'TESTAMENT.TESTAMENT', 'most', 'powerful', 'film', 'aftermath', 'nuclear', 'attack', 'ever', 'made', 'aired', 'television', 'right', 'time', 'movie', 'aftermath', 'nuclear', 'war', 'DAY', 'AFTER', 'aired', 'DAY', 'AFTER', 'kind', 'special', 'effects', 'extravaganza', 'complete', 'launching', 'missiles', 'mushroom', 'clouds', 'masses', 'people', 'hysteria', 'makeup', 'revealing', 'rotting', 'flesh', 'opens', 'sores', 'TESTAMENT', 'much', 'simpler', 'film', 'atomic', 'attack', 'represented', 'bright', 'flash', 'light', 'telephones', 'televisions', 'going', 'dead.Jane', 'Alexander', 'central', 'character', 'story', 'Carol', 'Wetherly', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'Wetherly', 'stay', 'home', 'mom', 'three', 'children', 'wonderful', 'husband', 'named', 'Tom', 'William', 'Devane', 'Wetherlys', 'live', 'small', 'town', 'Hamlin', 'CA', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'outside', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Tom', 'work', 'day', 'attack', 'never', 'back', 'agony', 'suffering', 'story', 'relayed', 'ever', 'so', 'eloquently', 'day', 'attack', 'Carol', 'Tom', 'never', 'going', 'come', 'back', 'realization', 'eventually', 'share', 'children', 'TESTAMENT', 'just', 'how', 'people', 'small', 'community', 'might', 'have', 'deal', 'nuclear', 'holocaust', 'ever', 'happened', 'people', 'burying', 'family', 'members', 'front', 'yards', 'town', 'meetings', 'one', 'local', 'churches', 'continue', 'drop', 'number', 'days', 'pass', 'people', 'using', 'HAM', 'radios', 'attempt', 'contact', 'someone', 'somewhere', 'struggle', 'find', 'food', 'frustration', 'wanting', 'leave', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'fuel.Perhaps', 'one', 'reasons', 'TESTAMENT', 'affected', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'raised', 'small', 'town', 'made', 'threat', 'what', 'nuclear', 'attack', 'could', 'do', 'very', 'real', 'Many', 'characters', 'film', 'reminded', 'people', 'knew', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'myself', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'situation', 'What', 'would', 'Mom', 'do', 'Would', 'be', 'able', 'survive', 'would', 'die', 'time', 'When', 'Cold', 'War', 'finally', 'thawed', '1989', 'finally', 'ended', 'less', 'year', 'later', 'TESTAMENT', 'was', 'forgotten', 'many', 'people', 'relic', 'past', ""'ve"", 'never', 'forgotten', 'film', 'images', 'have', 'been', 'seared', 'mind', 'was', 'child', 'However', 'post-9/11', 'world', 'live', 'TESTAMENT', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'relevant', 'ever', 'haunting', 'disturbing', 'film', 'TESTAMENT', 'film', 'American', 'should', 'watch', 'least', 'once.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'film', 'couple', 'featurettes', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'timeline', 'nuclear', 'age', 'enjoyed', 'TESTAMENT', 'AT', '20', 'featurette', 'best', 'was', 'honest', 'reflection', 'film', 'principal', 'actors']",Testament VHS

I just moved to Denver area to have a better life with my children that day.People in the cities who died in the blast from nuclear bombs were the lucky ones because the people in the fringes dies from radiation poisoning. A woman assumes her husband died in San Fransisco and has to care for her kids and dutifully cares for others children. And she watches them die while the remaining parts of the  world (including where she lives) implodes.There is one moving scene where she explains about lovemaking to her teenage daughter who knows that she will never experience that. I was also touched by how a 13 year old boy becomes a man to cope with the situation.I recommend this movie. We are not safe yet from this abominable possible destiny.
