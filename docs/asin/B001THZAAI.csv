1236432,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B001THZAAI,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","Screened in an effort to have a balanced perspective - and hopefully discover another Dany Boon gem.Having watched the incredibly enjoyable 'Rien &agrave; D&eacute;clarer' - remarks by others suggesting that the ""first version"" of writer/director Boon was the funnier and more enjoyable predecessor caught my eye. Of course, completely ignoring the fact that ""La Maison du Bonheur"" was his first large scale film production.A red flag for me when people begin their reviews with absolutes that are not based on facts.Now, having completed the movie, I'm curious what kind of humor passes for hilarity in those reviewer's lives?That's not to say that 'Bienvenue chez les Ch'timi' wasn't enjoyable. It was.Tells the story of Philippe Abrams, director of a mid-sized postal station looking to ""move south"" - a reference to the enviable sunny coasts of France. A transition prompted by an ever-demanding and emotionally draining wife. But despite years of requests, all he receives are the generic form letters thanking him for his interest. Until a single position is suddenly available - the perfect position. It's in a coastal town that his wife Julie loves and comes with perks that are the envy of every station manager. He'll do anything to be the one chosen. Anything. Up to and including cheating.Having already been passed over for several such plumb assignments - he needs an edge. So Philippe alters his application to indicate he's wheelchair bound, has been since childhood.A profound mistake.Soon after being selected - he's caught red-handed with his ... legs in the proverbial cookie jar. Beyond shamed, he's now a pariah in the postal service. And he's about to get his punishment.No sunny coasts with beaches. No year-round sun. No winters free of snow. For his transgression, he has been ordered to take up a station in the dreaded Nord Pas de Calais - the mythical ""North"". Director Boon plays on the theme that Americans would understand as the directional opposite - going South; forced to live and work in a region that has the reputation for being culturally primitive, morally vulgar, and socially inferior.As he arrives - it seems that every fear he had is validated. The weather is atrocious, the people uncivilized, their twists on the classic French language an abomination. Essentially the same thing a Northerner or Westerner would feel going to Alabama or Mississippi.Yet, as he sadly settles into his new home and job - things aren't nearly as bad as he had feared. In fact, the people turn out to be funny, warm and welcoming. The weather, at least during the Spring, extremely pleasant; the Summer promising even more tempered beauty. He's shocked to discover that he's happy. Really happy.Julie, who refused to travel with her husband, believes he suffers greatly for the family - an unexpected falsehood which he has to foster. Fearful to admit that he's quickly becoming one of them - the horrible 'Ch'timi' - a northerner. A transition made more challenging as he returns home every two weeks and lives a lie - confirming the hell of his new environs. Why not tell her the truth? Philippe recognized years ago that his lovely bride has been struggling with depression, explaining why he worked so hard for a new position; a relocation for her emotional health. The irony is that she's getting better the more he ""suffers"" - her inner strength and resolve repairing her damaged soul.All is well as Philippe begins to balance out his two lives - until Julie decides to join her embattled husband in the dreary North. He realizes that if she learns the truth - it could destroy their marriage, and worse, possibly destroy her.So a plan is concocted.A sweet film which had some amusing moments. The script was cleverly written, the acting performances excellent, and the tempo delivered a consistent stream of smiles.But uproarious laughter? No.As implied by complaining reviewers: Where were the moments of gut-busting, tear-inducing laughs? Something 'D&eacute;clarer' delivered in spades is found only toward the end of this warm and subtle movie.I'm trying hard to chalk this up to people having different perspectives. But, in truth, my sense is that reviewers trying to dismiss ""Rien &agrave; D&eacute;clarer"" as a second-rate Johnny-Come-Lately are actually pretentious tools desperate to cling to some imagined cinematic superiority. Typical film snobs.Again, a decent lighthearted 4-star film. A precursor to Boon's later work, among which is 'Rien a D&eacute;clarer'', which, in my opinion, is a  genuine laugh out loud and superior comedy.",4,"Gentle And Sweet Comedy, But Hardly Laugh Out Loud",1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,4581,"['Screened', 'effort', 'have', 'balanced', 'perspective', 'hopefully', 'discover', 'Dany', 'Boon', 'gem.Having', 'watched', 'incredibly', 'enjoyable', ""'Rien"", 'agrave', 'D', 'eacute', 'clarer', 'remarks', 'others', 'suggesting', 'first', 'version', 'writer/director', 'Boon', 'was', 'funnier', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'predecessor', 'caught', 'eye', 'course', 'completely', 'ignoring', 'fact', 'La', 'Maison', 'du', 'Bonheur', 'was', 'first', 'large', 'scale', 'film', 'production.A', 'red', 'flag', 'when', 'people', 'begin', 'reviews', 'absolutes', 'are', 'not', 'based', 'facts.Now', 'having', 'completed', 'movie', ""'m"", 'curious', 'what', 'kind', 'humor', 'passes', 'hilarity', 'reviewer', 'lives', 'not', 'say', ""'Bienvenue"", 'chez', ""Ch'timi"", 'was', ""n't"", 'enjoyable', 'story', 'Philippe', 'Abrams', 'director', 'mid-sized', 'postal', 'station', 'looking', 'move', 'south', 'reference', 'enviable', 'sunny', 'coasts', 'France', 'transition', 'prompted', 'ever-demanding', 'emotionally', 'draining', 'wife', 'years', 'requests', 'are', 'generic', 'form', 'letters', 'thanking', 'interest', 'single', 'position', 'suddenly', 'available', 'perfect', 'position', 'coastal', 'town', 'wife', 'Julie', 'perks', 'are', 'envy', 'station', 'manager', ""'ll"", 'do', 'anything', 'be', 'one', 'chosen', 'Anything', 'including', 'cheating.Having', 'already', 'been', 'passed', 'several', 'such', 'plumb', 'assignments', 'edge', 'So', 'Philippe', 'alters', 'application', 'indicate', 'wheelchair', 'bound', 'been', 'childhood.A', 'profound', 'mistake.Soon', 'being', 'selected', 'caught', 'red-handed', 'legs', 'proverbial', 'cookie', 'jar', 'Beyond', 'shamed', 'now', 'pariah', 'postal', 'service', 'get', 'punishment.No', 'sunny', 'coasts', 'beaches', 'year-round', 'sun', 'winters', 'free', 'snow', 'transgression', 'been', 'ordered', 'take', 'up', 'station', 'dreaded', 'Nord', 'Pas', 'Calais', 'mythical', 'North', 'Director', 'Boon', 'theme', 'Americans', 'would', 'understand', 'directional', 'opposite', 'going', 'South', 'forced', 'live', 'work', 'region', 'reputation', 'being', 'culturally', 'primitive', 'morally', 'vulgar', 'socially', 'inferior.As', 'fear', 'had', 'validated', 'weather', 'atrocious', 'people', 'uncivilized', 'twists', 'classic', 'French', 'language', 'abomination', 'Essentially', 'same', 'thing', 'Northerner', 'Westerner', 'would', 'feel', 'going', 'Alabama', 'Mississippi.Yet', 'sadly', 'new', 'home', 'job', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'had', 'feared', 'fact', 'people', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'funny', 'warm', 'welcoming', 'weather', 'least', 'Spring', 'extremely', 'pleasant', 'Summer', 'promising', 'even', 'more', 'tempered', 'beauty', 'shocked', 'discover', 'happy', 'Really', 'happy.Julie', 'who', 'refused', 'travel', 'husband', 'greatly', 'family', 'unexpected', 'falsehood', 'foster', 'Fearful', 'admit', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'one', 'horrible', ""'Ch'timi"", 'northerner', 'transition', 'made', 'more', 'challenging', 'home', 'two', 'weeks', 'lie', 'confirming', 'hell', 'new', 'environs', 'Why', 'not', 'tell', 'truth', 'Philippe', 'recognized', 'years', 'lovely', 'bride', 'been', 'struggling', 'depression', 'explaining', 'why', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'new', 'position', 'relocation', 'emotional', 'health', 'irony', 'getting', 'better', 'more', 'suffers', 'inner', 'strength', 'resolve', 'repairing', 'damaged', 'soul.All', 'well', 'Philippe', 'balance', 'out', 'two', 'Julie', 'join', 'embattled', 'husband', 'dreary', 'North', 'truth', 'could', 'destroy', 'marriage', 'worse', 'possibly', 'destroy', 'her.So', 'plan', 'concocted.A', 'sweet', 'film', 'had', 'amusing', 'moments', 'script', 'was', 'cleverly', 'written', 'acting', 'performances', 'excellent', 'tempo', 'delivered', 'consistent', 'stream', 'smiles.But', 'uproarious', 'laughter', 'No.As', 'implied', 'complaining', 'reviewers', 'Where', 'were', 'moments', 'gut-busting', 'tear-inducing', 'laughs', 'Something', ""'D"", 'eacute', 'clarer', 'delivered', 'spades', 'found', 'only', 'end', 'warm', 'subtle', 'movie.I', ""'m"", 'trying', 'hard', 'chalk', 'up', 'people', 'having', 'different', 'perspectives', 'truth', 'sense', 'reviewers', 'trying', 'dismiss', 'Rien', 'agrave', 'D', 'eacute', 'clarer', 'second-rate', 'Johnny-Come-Lately', 'are', 'actually', 'pretentious', 'tools', 'desperate', 'cling', 'imagined', 'cinematic', 'superiority', 'Typical', 'film', 'snobs.Again', 'decent', 'lighthearted', '4-star', 'film', 'precursor', 'Boon', 'later', 'work', ""'Rien"", 'D', 'eacute', 'clarer', 'opinion', 'genuine', 'laugh', 'loud', 'superior', 'comedy']",N/A

Kad Merad is the post office manager who gets caught pretending to be disabled to secure a transfer to the South of France only to be given the worst punishment in the post office's power: a transfer to the cold north of France, the Toxteth or Detroit of France. Once there he quickly discovers that (unlike Toxteth) it's not the backward disease-ridden inbred peasant slum of popular ridicule, but finds that comforting his imagined suffering cheers up his depressed wife back home, so ends up persuading his new friends to live down to all the horror stories when she comes to visit...It's not the most original plot or treatment in the world, with much of the wordplay built around the local accent that adds chti to every other word straight out of Abbott and Costello's Who's On First routine, but while predictable it's still very funny more often than not. The early scenes are among the funniest, be it Michel Galabru's Dickensian (or should that be Hugoian?) horror stories of a childhood in the north to the sympathetic traffic cop who tears up a ticket when he finds out the condemned man's destination, and the end is rather abrupt, but it's a confident feelgood comedy that delivers the goods. Kudos to Michael Katims' excellent subtitle adaptation that manages to pull off the tricky alliteration, puns and wordplay that a lesser translator might decide were simply untranslatable.The French PAL 2-disc set offers a wealth of unsubtitled extras, from a few deleted scenes and outtakes to lengthy documentaries and a themed French episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionare, but the film itself boasts both optional English subtitles and a very good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer.",4,"Slight, but a great feelgood movie",1284076800,"09 10, 2010",2010,1987,"['Dany', 'Boon', 'Bienvenue', 'chez', ""Ch'tis/Welcome"", 'Sticks', 'became', 'France', 'biggest', 'box-office', 'hit', 'record', 'time', 'when', 'pulled', '184m', 'France', 'alone', 'made', 'barely', 'ripple', 'English-speaking', 'world', 'shame', 'good', 'natured', 'culture', 'clash', 'comedy', 'lot', 'fun', 'Kad', 'Merad', 'post', 'office', 'manager', 'who', 'caught', 'pretending', 'be', 'disabled', 'secure', 'transfer', 'South', 'France', 'only', 'be', 'given', 'worst', 'punishment', 'post', 'office', 'power', 'transfer', 'cold', 'north', 'France', 'Toxteth', 'Detroit', 'France', 'Once', 'quickly', 'Toxteth', 'not', 'backward', 'disease-ridden', 'inbred', 'peasant', 'slum', 'popular', 'ridicule', 'comforting', 'imagined', 'suffering', 'cheers', 'up', 'depressed', 'wife', 'back', 'home', 'so', 'up', 'persuading', 'new', 'friends', 'live', 'down', 'horror', 'stories', 'when', 'visit', 'not', 'most', 'original', 'plot', 'treatment', 'world', 'much', 'wordplay', 'built', 'local', 'accent', 'chti', 'other', 'word', 'straight', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'Who', 'First', 'routine', 'predictable', 'still', 'very', 'funny', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'early', 'scenes', 'are', 'funniest', 'be', 'Michel', 'Galabru', 'Dickensian', 'should', 'be', 'Hugoian', 'horror', 'stories', 'childhood', 'north', 'sympathetic', 'traffic', 'cop', 'who', 'up', 'ticket', 'when', 'out', 'condemned', 'man', 'destination', 'end', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'confident', 'feelgood', 'comedy', 'goods', 'Kudos', 'Michael', 'Katims', 'excellent', 'subtitle', 'adaptation', 'pull', 'off', 'tricky', 'alliteration', 'puns', 'wordplay', 'lesser', 'translator', 'might', 'decide', 'were', 'simply', 'untranslatable.The', 'French', 'PAL', '2-disc', 'set', 'wealth', 'unsubtitled', 'extras', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'lengthy', 'documentaries', 'themed', 'French', 'episode', 'Who', 'Be', 'Millionare', 'film', 'optional', 'English', 'subtitles', 'very', 'good', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'transfer']",N/A
