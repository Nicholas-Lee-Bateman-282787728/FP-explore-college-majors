What did you do, look at the cover, see Nick Cannon, and write your review? Because this isn't like any other Nick Cannon movie I've ever seen. I was kind of disappointed because normally his movies are more for girls than guys and this seemed more like a guy movie.Nick Cannons CHARACTOR (not him!) is a police officer. He goes undercover at a high school campus to find out who has been stealing cars and commiting murder. It's a really funny movie and for guys there's lots of action and guns and stuff blowing up.

950850,A1U6XPYATU9OPG,B000BVM1WI,G. Denick,"[1, 2]","I happened to catch this movie on T.V. this afternoon, and... dear lord, it is mind-bogglingly bad! I actually thought that it was some low budget after school special, or perhaps some fan-made sequel in ""The Substitute"" series. Boy, was I surprised when I found out that this was actually in the theaters when it was released!The most ridiculous part of this movie is that the protagonist (Nick Cannon) is sent into a school as an undercover cop, to earn the trust of his classmates and unmask the crime ring that exists therein. There is slight problem with this logic, however... Nick Cannon's character is a black kid who promotes himself as being from the ghetto, and the school is made up entirely of privileged white kids! HOW could he ever earn their trust? The cops couldn't find one white kid to use as their undercover agent? This alone would make the movie hilarious, but the acting, dialogue, and ""action"" sequences are just as funny.So why did I give this movie three stars instead of one? Because it's hilarious! The producers sought to make a crime drama/action movie, but they unintentionally ended up with a comedy. This movie is so bad... it's actually kind of good! This level of badness is a thin line, indeed... it's sort of like a low budget movie made for the SyFy Channel, in that regard.If you can appreciate the humor in the film being so absurd, you will definitely get a kick out of it. If not, then you should avoid it at all costs.",3,"""Benedict Arnold?

He is instructed to go undercover as well as inducted into a high class private school to finish high school. Later on as the plot develops you find out that the head of the private school is forcing preppy teens to steal cars so he can trade for an extasy knockoff called ""bliss"".Opinion: I can only stand Nick Cannon in one movie and that is Drumline. When he tries to be funny he falls on his face. Let me show you all the ways that this movie wants to be Beverly Hills Cop. 1. Nick Cannon's character Tre tries to be funny but Axel Foley didnt have to try to be funny because he already was funny! 2. Tre' gets himself so deep into the case that it cost him his job just like Axel Foley does. 3. Tre's boss is just as hot-headed as Axel's boss. 4. The action scenes mimic what you would see in BHC. The only difference between the two is that in Underclassman, Tre is not visiting LA he lives there and BHC had more credible villains. The villian in this movie... what a ham! He definitely wins the the ham of the year award. Some irascible dean who forces preppy punk kids to steal cars so he can trade for an exctasy wannabe? Just slap that hoe and end the story! The script sounds like it was written by some hack who got inspired by BHC and said hey, I can do something like that. Rosalyn Sanchez is gorgeous as usual but that is still not a reason to see this movie. Another thing that bothers me is that Im sick and tired of seeing these cheesy white boys trying to act black in these movies. It's not funny and it will never be funny! Give it a rest PLEASE!
