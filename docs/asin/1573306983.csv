188713,ALR35EFI69S5R,1573306983,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[80, 80]","For those of us who grew up with him, watching John Denver so suddenly emerge onto the national stage as the huge talent he was is a memory savored and protected in these harsher times. I remember driving to graduate classes and hearing ""Annie's Song"" for the first time. it was quite an experience. I remember listening to ""Rocky Mountain High"" and how it affected me in terms of my growing appreciation for wild nature and the need for conservation. More than anything else, for me John still symbolizes that better part of our common human nature that those of us ragged,and hopefully ""gracefully aging"" counterculturists still associate with what personal enlightment and true education can do to transform this into a finer and more sustainable planet. Thus, this wonderful set of DVD (and also available CD recordings) that comprise the entire ""Wildlife Concert"" offering is a wonderous gift that reminds of of the immense range of talents and sensitivities he shared with us in his brief time on earth.Of course, you can rest assured that all of his famous songs are here, as well as a number of newer and less well known works, which are included as well. In the end, one is simply amazed at the freshness and novelty he is able to bring to bear in his presentation of many of the offerings here, in the wonderful way in which he performs some of these songs, singing lyrics he had sung thousands of times but seeming just as fresh and new as the first times he performed them. Like many artists, he doesn't necessarily stick to the familiar sound of the recorded version, and while that might annoy a few patrons who prefer the overly-familiar stamped-out record version, for me it is an indication of his great artistic prowess to able to do so this convincingly after all this time, and to do so with such aplomb, enthusiasm, and flavor. The comforting thing to understand is that at the time he had the concert, close to the time he died in the tragic airplane accident that abruptly ended his life, he seemed at the top of his form, regaining lost popularity, and ready to record new works in progress. This is a wonderful DVD, and one I recommend to all John Denver fans.

He had a unique gift of communicating simplicity and earnestness in a way that was penetrating yet comforting at the same time. This concert finds him in beautiful voice and mature artistry. He never tries to oversell the song; it flows effortlessly from him and he always performs from within himself. His love ballads are particularly affecting; he sings with such feeling yet never imposes the emotion on the listener, allowing us to experience the joy, longing or sadness within ourselves. That is true artistry. I found myself unashamedly wiping tears away on several occasions.His passion for his art and for wildlife preservation, communicated in the short interviews between songs, are infectious. Not hard to see why he inspired so many in his lifetime. Like many others who grew up in the 60's and 70's, some of the first songs I learned on the guitar were John Denver songs, which at the time just seemed like fun tunes to play. It's only been in recent years that I've learned to appreciate more fully the depth of his incredible gifts and legacy. He died not more than 2 years after this performance, and not more than 5 minutes from where I live in Pacific Grove, CA, in the waters of the Pacific Ocean.

I know many people consider John Denver &#65533;cheesy&#65533; but I've always loved his music.  To me, he is able to bring emotion to his written words better than any other singer/songwriter.  Most performers really struggle after the heat of their career flames out.  Having read Denver's biography, he did have those problems that may have led to some of his DUI charges.But when John Denver hit the stage, he always gave a great performance because he really connected with the audience and it showed.  And since this concert was for the Wildlife charity, his performance was close to his heart with personal testimony between some of the songs that drew John to tears.The stage presence and set-up was excellent and the DVD includes the audience participation by the mostly middle-aged fans.  For novice guitar players like myself there is plenty of film of John and the lead guitarist to help discover the magic of how he gets beautiful sound from his instrument.  While all his old standards are here, there is plenty of off-the-beaten path material if you haven't watched Denver in concert.  My particular favorite is the song written about the Alaska couple that dance after her husband's death. Denver had a unique ability to project great imagery.Most of his songs that deal with wilderness and the west are here which leaves out two of my favorites, his ode to the astronauts of the Columbia tragedy and his anti-war song with the Russian singer. With that aside, this DVD will always be a great memory of John Denver's career and his passion for the outdoors.

As a pianist in a small combo in the early '70's, I know how to get through a chorus of ""Country Roads"" in good shape.But I wasn't prepared for the onslaught of this video. This is one really fine performance.  By Denver AND by his band.  Nearly 2 hours.  Denver never resorts to tricks.  Never changes clothes or seems to take a break (although there HAD to be an intermission).  Just stands there and sings, and makes you believe it.  He is in fine voice and just always right on pitch.  If anything, his singing becomes more passionate as the concert progresses.  What vocal stamina he must have had.  And the connection with his audience was remarkable.If you like Denver's music in any way at all, then treat yourself to this DVD and you won't be sorry.  This is just one of the finest music concert videos I have ever seen. No gimicks here.  There is some commentary that was added later by Denver. In total, it may amount to 10 minutes or less.Plenty of room for the music.  All of Denver's biggies and then some. The video is standard full frame, don't expect a wide screen format. Audio is in two flavors, standard Dolby, and DTS 5.1  The latter seemed to me the best for hearing the lyrics better,",4,A great music DVD.,1231372800,"01 8, 2009",2009,1319,"['was', ""n't"", 'maybe', 'still', 'are', ""n't"", 'huge', 'John', 'Denver', 'fan', 'was', 'course', 'familiar', 'biggest', 'hits', 'pianist', 'small', 'combo', 'early', ""'70"", 'know', 'how', 'get', 'chorus', 'Country', 'Roads', 'good', 'shape.But', 'was', ""n't"", 'prepared', 'onslaught', 'video', 'one', 'really', 'fine', 'performance', 'Denver', 'band', 'Nearly', '2', 'hours', 'Denver', 'never', 'tricks', 'Never', 'clothes', 'take', 'break', 'there', 'HAD', 'be', 'intermission', 'Just', 'sings', 'believe', 'fine', 'voice', 'just', 'always', 'right', 'pitch', 'anything', 'singing', 'becomes', 'more', 'passionate', 'concert', 'What', 'vocal', 'stamina', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'connection', 'audience', 'was', 'remarkable.If', 'like', 'Denver', 'music', 'way', 'then', 'treat', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry', 'just', 'one', 'finest', 'music', 'concert', 'videos', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'gimicks', 'here', 'commentary', 'was', 'added', 'later', 'Denver', 'total', 'may', 'amount', '10', 'minutes', 'less.Plenty', 'room', 'music', 'Denver', 'biggies', 'then', 'video', 'standard', 'full', 'frame', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'wide', 'screen', 'format', 'Audio', 'two', 'flavors', 'standard', 'Dolby', 'DTS', '5.1', 'latter', 'seemed', 'best', 'hearing', 'lyrics', 'better']",The Wildlife Concert
