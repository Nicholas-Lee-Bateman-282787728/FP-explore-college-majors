1207232,A2WFQNVRCE3KTL,B001JXPC5K,Nobody,"[1, 2]","Season 10 is the one that really renewed the show, Patrick McKenna took off to do some other things, and that gave a chance for the other guys to get more involved.  When McKenna returned in Season 11, the balance of the show changed, his character Harold naturally is the looniest of the bunch.  Still, Winston, Dalton, and particularly Mike remain established as central characters, and the last seasons from this point out are really the best, an ensemble cast who know each others' timing instinctively.Don't expect anything great here, if you don't know the show, the very mild and cheesy humor is part of the charm, it's really sappy stuff out of context.  But, that's not likely, pretty much anyone buying this DVD already has seen these episodes multiple times, and for those people these bits fit like an old coat.  So why I am going on about this?  You already know.  Excuse me, I gotta run, it's 10PM and the show is on.

A great diversion from the complications of reality.  The entire series is an irreverent look at the modern man.  Funny, and insightful at the same time.  Easily the funniest thing from Canada I've seen.
