The characters are just so lovable (or some are the type you just love to hate).  The storylines are so out there, but at the same time have quite a few bits that are relatable and have something you can learn from.  There is a little bit for everybody.",5,I LOVE DETTY!,1319673600,"10 27, 2011",2011,383,"['really', 'love', 'show', 'wish', 'ABC', 'smartened', 'up', 'brought', 'back', 'least', 'made', 'movie', 'really', 'miss', 'show', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'lovable', 'are', 'type', 'just', 'love', 'hate', 'storylines', 'are', 'so', 'there', 'same', 'time', 'have', 'quite', 'few', 'bits', 'are', 'relatable', 'have', 'something', 'can', 'learn', 'little', 'bit', 'everybody']",N/A
1342753,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B003F3NDOE,Daryl B,"[4, 4]","I regret that I've only gotten around to seeing the last season of Ugly Betty just now.  I've been a fan of the show since I saw the first episode and during the last season I was quite busy with work and wasn't able to enjoy the final season of one of my favorite TV shows of recent years.  While bigger shows (that I also enjoyed such as Lost and 24) may have gotten bigger fanfare in their exits from the small screen, I think Betty's final bow was as poignant and touching as any finale I've seen.I was saddened to hear that the show was ending but perhaps it was the right time for the show.  The last season ended on a high note.  They tied up some loose ends, allowed us to see some of Betty's old flames (Henry and Gio) and allowed Hilda to finally find true love (with CSI Miami's Adam Rodriquez).  Rather than rely on huge stars to pepper the final season (like Shakira, who was in an episode) they instead gave us the things that we've come to love about Ugly Betty---the great Wilomena one liners, the crazy antics of Marc and Amanda, the dedication of the Suarez family and the true spirit of Betty. What most of us loved about Betty was her determination to succeed and her belief in her dreams; something I think most of us can relate to.  While along there way there was lots of outlandish comic soap opera-esque moments, there were also scenes and storylines that were well done and life affirming. The storyline with Justin and his coming out were very sweet and sent a positive message to gay teenagers who may be struggling with the same questions and worries in their own lives.  And the Suarez clan's support and love for their gay teenager is an example as well to family members who find that they have a gay teen or family member.  One of the most memomorable scenes of the final 4 or 5 episodes has Justin coming out to his family by dancing with his boyfriend at his mom's wedding.  Its a subtle, lovely scene that is one of the best of the entire series.  It was also great to see a show that gave voice to the latin community and presented latinos in the limelight for a change.I'll miss the wicked schemes of Wilomena, portrayed to a tee by the talented Vanessa Williams, Marc and Amanda's unyielding catty remarks and the charm of America Ferrera, for whom without the series would have never been a success.  Her turn as Betty was someone who we could all identify with and root for and her gradual transformation revealed the beauty of the woman inside.  Betty never gave up on her goals or herself and made the choices that were right for her, a positive role model for young women.  She may have become more aware of fashion but she never abandoned who she truly was.I'll definitely add this final season to my dvd collection.  I'm glad we got to know Betty.....and I'm glad that at the end of the show, they dropped the ""ugly"" from the title as the final scene faded to black.  Betty may not have been a fashionista to begin with but she was beautiful on the inside.  Highly recommended!",5,Betty la bonita,1293494400,"12 28, 2010",2010,3023,"['regret', ""'ve"", 'only', 'gotten', 'seeing', 'last', 'season', 'Ugly', 'Betty', 'just', 'now', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'show', 'saw', 'first', 'episode', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'quite', 'busy', 'work', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'enjoy', 'final', 'season', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'shows', 'recent', 'years', 'bigger', 'shows', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'such', 'Lost', '24', 'may', 'have', 'gotten', 'bigger', 'fanfare', 'exits', 'small', 'screen', 'think', 'Betty', 'final', 'bow', 'was', 'poignant', 'touching', 'finale', ""'ve"", 'seen.I', 'was', 'saddened', 'hear', 'show', 'was', 'ending', 'perhaps', 'was', 'right', 'time', 'show', 'last', 'season', 'ended', 'high', 'note', 'tied', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'allowed', 'see', 'Betty', 'old', 'flames', 'Henry', 'Gio', 'allowed', 'Hilda', 'finally', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'CSI', 'Miami', 'Adam', 'Rodriquez', 'Rather', 'rely', 'huge', 'stars', 'pepper', 'final', 'season', 'Shakira', 'who', 'was', 'episode', 'instead', 'gave', 'things', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'about', 'Ugly', 'Betty', '-the', 'great', 'Wilomena', 'one', 'liners', 'crazy', 'antics', 'Marc', 'Amanda', 'dedication', 'Suarez', 'family', 'true', 'spirit', 'Betty', 'What', 'most', 'loved', 'Betty', 'was', 'determination', 'succeed', 'belief', 'dreams', 'something', 'think', 'most', 'can', 'relate', 'way', 'was', 'lots', 'outlandish', 'comic', 'soap', 'opera-esque', 'moments', 'were', 'also', 'scenes', 'storylines', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'life', 'affirming', 'storyline', 'Justin', 'coming', 'out', 'were', 'very', 'sweet', 'sent', 'positive', 'message', 'gay', 'teenagers', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'struggling', 'same', 'questions', 'worries', 'own', 'lives', 'Suarez', 'clan', 'support', 'love', 'gay', 'teenager', 'example', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'find', 'have', 'gay', 'teen', 'family', 'member', 'One', 'most', 'memomorable', 'scenes', 'final', '4', '5', 'episodes', 'Justin', 'coming', 'out', 'family', 'dancing', 'boyfriend', 'mom', 'wedding', 'subtle', 'lovely', 'scene', 'one', 'best', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'show', 'gave', 'voice', 'latin', 'community', 'presented', 'latinos', 'limelight', 'change.I', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'wicked', 'schemes', 'Wilomena', 'portrayed', 'tee', 'talented', 'Vanessa', 'Williams', 'Marc', 'Amanda', 'unyielding', 'catty', 'remarks', 'charm', 'America', 'Ferrera', 'whom', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'success', 'turn', 'Betty', 'was', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'identify', 'root', 'gradual', 'transformation', 'revealed', 'beauty', 'woman', 'inside', 'Betty', 'never', 'gave', 'up', 'goals', 'made', 'choices', 'were', 'right', 'positive', 'role', 'model', 'young', 'women', 'may', 'have', 'become', 'more', 'aware', 'fashion', 'never', 'abandoned', 'who', 'truly', 'was.I', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'add', 'final', 'season', 'dvd', 'collection', ""'m"", 'glad', 'got', 'know', 'Betty', '..and', ""'m"", 'glad', 'end', 'show', 'dropped', 'ugly', 'title', 'final', 'scene', 'faded', 'black', 'Betty', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'fashionista', 'begin', 'was', 'beautiful', 'inside', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

If you haven't seen Ugly Betty, start with season 1, you won't want to miss a blessed second of the great jokes, comedic artistry, or compelling story.

1342755,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003F3NDOE,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[6, 9]","""UGLY BETTY"", a series that captured the attention of millions of viewers with its heartwarming and hilarious storyline and it helps that the series is an adaptation of the popular Colombian telenovela ""Betty la fea"" by Fernando Gaitan. The series revolved around Betty Suarez (America Ferrera, ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" films, ""Lords of Dogtown""), a woman with a kind heart and is always giving. The problem is that she is not fashionable, known for her thick hair, eyebrows and big glasses and braces.  And now the series which won Emmy, Golden Globe and Peabody Awards bids its final farewell with its fourth and final season.In Season 1, audiences got to see how the unfashionable Betty got a job at the high fashion publication Mode Magazine and work as an assistant for Daniel Meade (Eric Mabius, ""The L World"", ""The O.C."", ""Eyes"")., the Editor-in-Chief. Despite her looks and how badly she is treated at the workplace, Daniel sees the kindness in her heart and she manages to reach out to him and help him through his troubles.The stories tend to focus on various storylines that revolve around Betty's world. Betty lives with her father, Ignacio Suarez (Tony Plana, ""24', ""Commander-in-Chief"") who happens to be a God believing man and very protective over his family. Her sister Hilda (Ana Ortiz, ""Boston Legal"", ""Batman: Gotchic Knight"") who moves back at home with her son Justin (Mark Indelicato). They are a strong Latino family with Betty more proper, while her sister is more street smarts.At Mode Magazine, there is a bit of strife as behind-the-scenes Wilhelmina Slater (Vanessa Williams, ""Hannah Montana: The Movie"", ""Boom Town"", ""South Beach"") tries to find ways she can move up and own Mode Magazine and in Season 1, she goes after Daniel's father Brandon Meade (Alan Dale, ""The O.C."", ""LOST"") and has an affair with him. Wilhelmina trusts her loyal assistant Marc St. James (Michael Urie) to do her dirty work. Meanwhile, Marc and receptionist Amanda Tanen (Becki Newton, ""American Dreams"") are like two peas in a pod as they gossip about those who work for Mode Magazine, constantly make fun of Betty but yet despite their trash talking, they somehow also end up getting closer to Betty. As for Betty, she can always depend on her friend and Mode Magazine costume designer Christina McKinney (Ashley Jensen, ""Extras"" and ""Eleventh Hour"") to go, if times are tough at work.In Season Two, Wilhelmina was doing anything she can to own Mode Magazine but her goal to marry Brandon Meade doesn't go quite well but she manages to have sex with him and gets pregnant right before he dies. Meanwhile we are introduced to Daniel's brother Alex turned woman named Alexis (Rebecca Romjin, ""X-Men"" films, ""Pepper Dennis"") who is like another rival to Daniel and we also meet his mother who just escaped prison, Claire Meade (Judith Light, ""Who's the Boss""). Meanwhile, two men - Henry and Gio vie for Betty's affection and one asks her hand in marriage.In Season Three, we see Betty taking a more proactive approach in her job and trying to rise in the ranks of Mode but things get a bit crazy when her high school rival Kimmie (played by Lindsay Lohan) enters her life once again and takes part in the Young Editors Training Program (YETI). Meanwhile, Hilda's salon is doing well but the city shuts it down, meanwhile Cliff and Marc become closer and eventually want to marry or will they? As for Daniel and Wilhelmina, the two must work together in ensuring that Mode Magazine becomes profitable.In Season Four, Betty has now risen in her career at Mode Magazine and has become features editor.  But similar to how she had to prove herself as an assistant, now Betty must prove that she deserves to be a features editor despite many challenges including a jealous Marc who was also up for the job.Daniel is trying to deal with his wife's death and joins a support group which may be a cult.  Meanwhile, Hilda must make a difficult decision in her relationship with Archie, especially when her old boyfriend Bobby enters her life.  Justin must deal with the prejudice he faces in high school and most of all, trying to find out about how to deal with his homosexuality and keeping it private or making it public.  Wilhelmina gets hooked into a coverup when her daughter Miko has returned and is accused of murder, while trying to deal with the disappearance of Connor.  And Claire wants to find the son that she had given up for adoption.""Ugly Betty - The Complete Fourth and Final Season"" features 20 episodes on four discs.VIDEO & AUDIO:""UGLY BETTY"" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) and is enhanced for 169 televisions. Production for ""UGLY BETY"" is quite slick and for a drama series, picture quality is along the same lines as abc studio's other DVD releases. Which is pretty good and compression artifacts and low light noise is not as visible.As for audio, ""UGLY BETTY"" is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The series is front and center channel driven. Dialogue is clear, music is clear and overall, not a series to expect a lot of sound effects on your surround channels but for the most part, dialogue is understandable.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Ugly Betty - The Complete Fourth and Final Season"" includes the following special features:DISC 1:* Deleted Scenes - Two deleted scenes which include ""Connor Checked Out"" and ""Steam Room"".DISC 2:* Deleted Scenes - Three deleted scenes which include ""I'm Available"", ""What is Level 5?"" and ""Breathe"".DISC 3:* Mode After Hours - Featuring the following Marc and Amanda ""Mode After Hours"" segments: Stress-Orcism (3:35), Role-Playing (3:26), Queenseeker (5:16) and Harassment of a Sexual Nature (3:39).* Deleted Scene - Featuring two deleted scenes: ""Elevator Chatter"" and ""Male Models"".DISC 4:* Betty Goes Bahamas - (8:30) Behind-the-scenes of what the cast did during their stay in the Bahamas.  Becki Newton and Michael Urie try to go around the Bahamas to see what the cast is up to.* Betty Bloops - (6:32) ""Ugly Betty"" Season Four outtakes.* Deleted Scenes - Featuring three deleted scenes: ""Guy Talk"", ""Wedding Planning"" and ""Going Too Far"".* Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary for ""All the World's a Stage"" (episode 81) with commentary by Michael Urie and Mark Indelicato.EXTRAS:""Ugly Betty - The Complete Fourth and Final Season"" comes with a slip over cover.JUDGMENT CALLI have to admit that I was a bit surprised that ""Ugly Betty"" was canceled.  It started off strong when it was shown on Thursday but as usual, when you air a series on Friday, it's usually a nail on the coffin.  But if there is one thing that abc execs did right for the staff and stars of the series was that it gave them the chance to finish the series with style.  And with the way this series ended, ""Ugly Betty"" fans were treated with a wonderful ending.I'll miss watching the Suarez family, the humorous adventures of Betty and Daniel, the troublesome duo, Marc and Amanda and of course the drama that usually had accompanied the series.  But most importantly, it's that ray of sunshine the series had brought to millions of viewers each week.Having watched the series since it first began, I've looked at ""Ugly Betty"" as a series that was not only well-written and well-cast but also a series that was important as it revolved around a Latino family and truthfully, there have not been many drama/comedy series on television featuring a lead character that is Latino but also a female, so in many ways, the series sure made its mark in American pop culture and it's a shame that the series was canceled (and several years earlier, the sitcom ""The George Lopez"" show which broke new ground was also canceled).""Ugly Betty"" has been a wonderful series and although the ratings may have tapered off (as did other ABC drama series such as ""Desperate Housewives"" and my other favorite series now ended, ""Lost""), this fourth season continued the drama, the fun that the show was known for.  I felt that this fourth season finally broke new ground for Betty as we have seen her advance in her new career and we finally see the braces come off, but what the writers were able to do is focus on the supporting characters.The fourth season dealt with Daniel's healing process after the death of his wife, we see Hilda dating a politician but then seeing how life had affected her after a one night stand with an ex-boyfriend, for years we have seen Justin grow in the series but wondered how the writers would handle his ""coming out"" and we watched the continued power struggle between Wilhelmina and Claire Meade.  As important as the series for Betty fans, the writers gave viewers the opportunity to watch each character grow and in some sense, every character was like family.  Despite the class differences between characters, somehow we saw how they intermeshed because of Betty and by the end, everything worked out.""Ugly Betty - The Complete Fourth and Final Season"" features the same fun bonus content as previous releases.  I was hoping for audio commentary for this release especially for the final episode or the episode when the cast went to the Bahamas.  But you do get the one audio commentary.  The DVD picture quality is very good and audio is clear and understandable. I did wish ABC released this series on Blu-ray but overall, fans of the series should be happy with the overall DVD.In the end, ""Ugly Betty"" completes its run with style, dignity, fun and many laughs.  But also a final tearful goodbye to the characters that we have watched for four incredible seasons.  For fans of ""Ugly Betty"" and those who enjoyed the fourth season, ""Ugly Betty - The Complete Fourth and Final Season"" is definitely recommended!",5,"The final season of ""Ugly Betty"" finishes off

TV on the other hand, well, at that point its Thursday line-up had a lot to be desired. So I turned on Wheel of Fortune to see if the woman who was up $10,000 would hit the bankrupt slot or guess that the answer was ""Granny's Homemade Apple Pie."" Usually I would flip through the channels during commercial breaks, but like I said there was nothing else on. And then I saw a commercial that caught my attention. Popping up on the screen of my television was a 20-some odd girl with big blue braces, red glasses, and frizzy hair. ""Ugly Betty! The world premiere at 8/7 central!"" the narrator declared. And I decided to watch. 9 months 11 months later I found myself purchasingUgly Betty - The Complete First Seasonand then 14 months later I purchasedUgly Betty: The Complete Second Seasonand then a year and a half later I purchasedUgly Betty: Season 3and then I found myself watching season season 4.And it wasn't too long before I found myself reading on Wikipedia that the brilliant, award-winning show was cancelled by ABC. Once again, ABC cancelled a great show. At least we got four seasons out of this one. But before I continue I just have to put this out there, SPOILER ALERT! In season 4 we open up with Betty getting her braces removed, but of course it was just a dream. We see her getting her new job has a junior-editor. We see her getting back together with Matt (with whom she broke up with in the season 3 finale). And as we go on further into the season seeing her house burn down. We see a lot more, and with only four episodes left, I just hope that ""Ugly Betty"" ends as good as it began.And now to the DVD. The box set will most likely consist of 5 discs.

I love these characters and I love the atmosphere that they're in.  And even if the show took a little dip in quality in season 3, it's still as lovable and heartwarming as it always has been.  Now, the show that changed the face of television is now coming to an end.  In this fourth and final season, we find Betty now getting closer and closer to her dreams as everything concludes where all plots are resolved and characters get their just desserts.  The show ended at the perfect time and I'm glad that I found a truely great show to entertain me every Thursday and Friday night for 4 years.  We could all learn something from Betty.

The story lines have been so engaging, the costumes so outlandish, the moments so tender and sweet. The characters are all at their best in Season 4 - Marc and Amanda, Wilhelmina, Hilda.  What I love most about this final season is how the characters have grown up and developed over the last four years and how unlikely friendships have been formed - Amanda and Betty for example.  Also, in Season 1, a romantic relationship between Daniel and Betty would have been unthinkable, but as Daniel has matured over the years, and Betty's confidence has grown and she's become more comfortable with herself, it was completely believable when the season finale hinted at the possibility of a Daniel-Betty relationship.  In other ways, the season finale was just right, it tied everything up well and gave each character the future they deserve.

Things were starting to get a little static this season, and I found myself watching more out of habit than desire.Despite the fact that our heroine is finally climbing the corporate ladder, the series itself seems stuck in a rut this season.""Ugly Betty"" always impressed me with its guest casting, but this year's guest stars, such as Lynn Redgrave in her last role, and the sadly underused Judy Gold, seem wasted, their roles underwritten.Kristen Johnston and RuPaul both appear, looking emaciated. Kristen's part was at least bigger as she plays a former Mode receptionist of undeterminable age, who wants to get into Mark's pants.Some of the storylines this year were either too dull or too far-fetched.I didn't care for the whole Daniel-is-seduced-by-a-cult plot. The scene where Matt distracts the security guards so that the ladies can rescue Daniel looked as though they were re-enacting an episode of ""Josie and the Pussycats"" the cartoonish way Betty, Claire and Amanda all ascended the stairs in unison.The show only begins to get interesting around Episode 7 when both Betty and Hilda buy the pregnancy tests.Even the road trip to the Bahamas does nothing to inject some sizzle, as it's a case of too-little-too-late. The later trek to London where Betty drags Hilda and Amanda along for a bachelorette party fares much better, due to the welcome and surprise return of Christina and Gio.The writers keep tricking us into thinking Justin is going to confide in Mark about being in love with a boy from his acting class. The scene where they finally kiss is very well done.The scripts get better as the season progresses and the last four shows are highly entertaining!The show pays homage to ""Dynasty"" in a fun catfight sequence between Wilhemina and Claire.Which reminds me; the old warhorses of Mode both look more glamorous this season than they ever have. Vanessa Williams begins the season looking fantastic, like a 1940s movie goddess, and I swear Judith Light looks 20 years younger than she did in Season One.Speaking of looks, this being the final year of the series, Betty makes a gradual progression from ugly duckling to beautiful swan.She loses the bangs, starts dressing the part of a Mode editor, and as the final four episodes wind down, her braces come off.The series finale begins with a funeral. Betty must decide whether to rekindle a former relationship or move on to a new exciting endeavour.The show comes to a satisfying conclusion that nicely ties up the fates of its characters.Though Season Four wasn't as easy to get through, those who have invested four years in the show should definitely follow it through to the end. I'm glad I did and ""Ugly Betty"" will always be among my Top Ten shows of 2000-2009.",4,Not So Much Ugly Betty as Boring Betty This Season,1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,2864,"['**NOTE', 'REVIEW', 'MAY', 'CONTAIN', 'MINOR', 'SPOILERS**', 'Ugly', 'Betty', 'was', 'fun', 'ride', 'lasted', 'ended', 'right', 'time', 'Things', 'were', 'starting', 'get', 'little', 'static', 'season', 'found', 'watching', 'more', 'habit', 'desire.Despite', 'fact', 'heroine', 'finally', 'climbing', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'series', 'stuck', 'rut', 'season', 'Ugly', 'Betty', 'always', 'impressed', 'guest', 'casting', 'year', 'guest', 'stars', 'such', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'last', 'role', 'sadly', 'underused', 'Judy', 'Gold', 'seem', 'wasted', 'roles', 'Johnston', 'RuPaul', 'appear', 'looking', 'emaciated', 'Kristen', 'part', 'was', 'least', 'bigger', 'former', 'Mode', 'receptionist', 'undeterminable', 'age', 'who', 'get', 'Mark', 'pants.Some', 'storylines', 'year', 'were', 'either', 'too', 'dull', 'too', 'far-fetched.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'whole', 'Daniel-is-seduced-by-a-cult', 'plot', 'scene', 'where', 'Matt', 'security', 'guards', 'ladies', 'can', 'rescue', 'Daniel', 'looked', 'were', 're-enacting', 'episode', 'Josie', 'Pussycats', 'cartoonish', 'way', 'Betty', 'Claire', 'Amanda', 'ascended', 'stairs', 'unison.The', 'show', 'only', 'get', 'interesting', 'Episode', '7', 'when', 'Betty', 'Hilda', 'buy', 'pregnancy', 'road', 'trip', 'Bahamas', 'nothing', 'inject', 'sizzle', 'case', 'too-little-too-late', 'later', 'trek', 'London', 'where', 'Betty', 'Hilda', 'Amanda', 'along', 'bachelorette', 'party', 'fares', 'much', 'better', 'due', 'welcome', 'surprise', 'return', 'Christina', 'Gio.The', 'writers', 'keep', 'tricking', 'thinking', 'Justin', 'going', 'confide', 'Mark', 'being', 'love', 'boy', 'acting', 'class', 'scene', 'where', 'finally', 'kiss', 'very', 'well', 'done.The', 'scripts', 'get', 'better', 'season', 'last', 'four', 'shows', 'are', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'show', 'homage', 'Dynasty', 'fun', 'catfight', 'sequence', 'Wilhemina', 'Claire.Which', 'old', 'warhorses', 'Mode', 'look', 'more', 'glamorous', 'season', 'ever', 'have', 'Vanessa', 'Williams', 'season', 'looking', 'fantastic', '1940s', 'movie', 'goddess', 'swear', 'Judith', 'Light', '20', 'years', 'younger', 'did', 'Season', 'One.Speaking', 'looks', 'being', 'final', 'year', 'series', 'Betty', 'gradual', 'progression', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'beautiful', 'swan.She', 'bangs', 'dressing', 'part', 'Mode', 'editor', 'final', 'four', 'episodes', 'wind', 'down', 'braces', 'come', 'off.The', 'series', 'finale', 'funeral', 'Betty', 'must', 'decide', 'rekindle', 'former', 'relationship', 'move', 'new', 'exciting', 'endeavour.The', 'show', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'nicely', 'up', 'fates', 'characters.Though', 'Season', 'Four', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'easy', 'get', 'who', 'have', 'invested', 'four', 'years', 'show', 'should', 'definitely', 'follow', 'end', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Ugly', 'Betty', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Top', 'Ten', '2000-2009']",N/A

That Love Affair would go on to the end, and While I could pin point a few ""flaws"" in some plots I never lost my love for ""Betty"". I am still bitter that ABC moved it around and alas the show ended sooner than it Should Have.Anyway here in all it's glory is Season 4, maybe the best season since the first.

The fourth and final season of Ugly Betty tracks Betty and her world and tries it's best to find a reasonable send off point (NOT CLOSURE) for all characters involved.  BRAVO to the main actors (especially Mark Indelicato, Becki Newton, Michael Urie, Vanessa Williams and the super awesome America Ferrera) for giving us some great character acting and real good and sad times.  I will miss this show.  here's the rundown of the fourth and final season.essentially: (BEWARE OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS)-Hilda finds happiness, as the show decided, where and with whom she fits with. (closure)-Ignacio comes to terms with the idea of his girls growing up and finds some sort of love, (we don't get much)-Amanda finds what she's been looking for, or rather it finds her, (we don't get much)-Marc becomes what he wants to be and finally get's credit from everybody who never noticed (closure)-Justin has probably the BIGGEST (duhh) revelation, but it could have sent out more of an impact for the viewers or fans to see him understand himself and be a message for tolerance and acceptance. (agonizing closure but a great story within a story)-Wilhelmina sort of gets what she wants and, SURPRISE, it doesn't come by her schemes or plans after all (closure)-Claire finally finds peace with her family (closure)-Daniel finally realizes what's important and who really matters and takes a huge leap (agonizing closure)-Betty finally takes a next step and a new chapter seems to start and although her love life seems in shambles as always a new possibility presents itself in the end (agonizing closure)Unanswered questions and what we don't get to see or will ever know is:-What about Christina's husband Stewart?-How do Wilhelmina and Claire find a medium given their final circumstances?-Does Ignacio ever get to be with his long distance love?-What happens to Conner?-Does Tyler ever go about tackling his father?-Does Wilhelmina ever find peace with her family (daughter, father, sister)?-Does Alexis and Daniel Jr ever become a family and or return?And of course there is that ending.... I won't spoil that one, BUT OHHHHHHH, to not know what happens is both elegant, fair but a painstaking end to a knockout series.
