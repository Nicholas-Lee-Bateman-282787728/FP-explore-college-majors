This movie is a comedy created by writers that weren't chasing Hollywood's highest honors, but instead seemed inspired by old slapstick faves.

Very few Hollywood ""holiday"" movies have reference to Christ anymore, but this movie makes it perfectly clear in subtle ways throughout. Including a very touching scene that will pull on your heartstrings.Putting DeVito and Broderick together was brilliant. Perfect casting.  Their chemistry (Or, maybe I should say lack there-of) set the scene for some comical hi-jinx that will have you rolling! The girls and kids in the cast were terrific as well. Hardly any CGG. Almost all the special effects were live on film, but it's really impressive. Make sure you watch the special features on the disc. Was quite amazing how they created Christmas in June. The enormity of the construction and electrical engineering will make your jaw drop when you see how they did it.

They have warmth, humor, and a genuineness to them. But some filmmakers think all you need are a bunch of twinkling lights, some snow, and a guy in a Santa suit to be a great holiday film, no matter what. This film is one of those. There isn't anything even remotely funny about the film or it's situation. Everything looks too pristine and plastic. So do the characters. Sure it's digestible enough fluff, but you can only take so much before you are an overstuffed candy cane filled to the brim of lights and Christmas 'this' and Christmas 'that'. I love Christmas. It's my time of the year. But this movie just felt wrong. It had a fun enough premise. Matthew Broderick is the ""Christmas guy"" in his little town, until new neighbor Buddy Hall(Danny DeVito), moves in across the street. Buddy wants to do something special. He wants to be noticed. He wants his house to be seen from outer space, and he figures he can do that by filling every nook and cranny of his house with Christmas lights and assorted decorations. Obviously, this doesn't sit well with Broderick, being de-throned as Christmas king. The premise has all the potential in the comedy world for some fun humor and slapstick, but it all seems as flat as egg nog come January. For a film about a joyous season and heart, it feels devoid of anything joyous or heartfelt. When it tries to be warm and have heart, it just doesn't ring true. It seems as fake as the snow in the movie. The movie has a good cast, and that's what makes it's failures all the more noticeable and disappointing. Danny DeVito, Matthew Broderick, Kristin Davis, and Kristin Chenoweth are all great people, but they fail to deliver anything in their respective roles. Each one seems to be going thru the motions. It's really an accomplishment to make the usually fun and bubbly Chenoweth...um, not. The movie is all window dressing with nothing underneath and nowhere to go. Did I laugh at all?. I did like Broderick's daughter(Arrested Development's Alia Shawkat)threatening to call the children's welfare bureau(or something like that)over him making her wear a Christmas sweater for the family photo.

I have heard people say they loved this movie and others say they hated it, I fall somewhere in the middle I suppose. At first glance this seems like it has the potential to be a holiday classic. Sadly after watching this it falls flat and never reaches the level of entertainment the actors can deliver. Still this is not a horrible movie or at least to me. It may be the things going on with me lately that makes me feel like a need an escape ever once in a while but I thought the film was ok.Steve Finch [Broderick] is a man set in his ways who believes in traditions and is about to begin his duties of planning the town Christmas. That is until a man named Buddy Hall [Danny DeVito] moves in across the street, then things don't seem to go his way. Buddy is a guy that is bored with life and just wants to find his purpose in life. It turns out that purpose may be to annoy his neighbor in trying to be seen from space. So as Buddy try's to light his house up with Christmas lights the neighbors go to war. Subtle at first but as the war rages on it gets nastier, even costing them their families.I found this film to be a little tame at times because before watching it I really thought they went all out on each other. Tame may not be the right word but I thought they went at it harder. Things get childish at times which may be another downfall in this film but to be honest sometimes it is entertaining. I kinda expected a little more of a war between the two especially since the three writers on this film have done some entertaining films in the past. That may be indeed be the problem, the script and not the actors.To be honest as far as acting goes this film is pretty good since they are only performing what is on the page. DeVito is pretty entertaining to me in this one since he is very believable in the role. Same can be said for Broderick who seems like the type that could be up tight like his character. Everyone in the film do good jobs from the wives to the towns' people. Director John Whitesell who has done some good stuff especially in the TV world could be at fault as well for not helping the film reach its full potential.To be fair the film is not horrible and can be an entertaining at times, in fact it is a good natured movie. The cast does bring something to it that it needed and like I said I enjoyed especially for what is going on right now. I do recommend this movie with the brain off and as a rental. I know people who don't like this film but I do know others who do, if I had to choose I would say I am one of those who do.",3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,1264377600,"01 25, 2010",2010,2719,"['DECK', 'THE', 'HALLSI', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'many', 'chances', 'watch', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'much', 'last', 'month', 'certain', 'things', 'one', 'did', 'catch', 'have', 'heard', 'people', 'say', 'loved', 'movie', 'others', 'say', 'hated', 'fall', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'suppose', 'first', 'glance', 'potential', 'be', 'holiday', 'classic', 'Sadly', 'watching', 'flat', 'never', 'level', 'entertainment', 'actors', 'can', 'deliver', 'Still', 'not', 'horrible', 'movie', 'least', 'may', 'be', 'things', 'going', 'lately', 'feel', 'need', 'escape', 'ever', 'once', 'while', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'ok.Steve', 'Finch', '[', 'Broderick', ']', 'man', 'set', 'ways', 'who', 'traditions', 'about', 'begin', 'duties', 'planning', 'town', 'Christmas', 'man', 'named', 'Buddy', 'Hall', '[', 'Danny', 'DeVito', ']', 'street', 'then', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'go', 'way', 'Buddy', 'guy', 'bored', 'life', 'just', 'find', 'purpose', 'life', 'out', 'purpose', 'may', 'be', 'annoy', 'neighbor', 'trying', 'be', 'seen', 'space', 'So', 'Buddy', 'try', 'light', 'house', 'up', 'Christmas', 'neighbors', 'go', 'war', 'Subtle', 'first', 'war', 'nastier', 'even', 'costing', 'families.I', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'little', 'tame', 'times', 'watching', 'really', 'thought', 'went', 'out', 'other', 'Tame', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'right', 'word', 'thought', 'went', 'harder', 'Things', 'get', 'childish', 'times', 'may', 'be', 'downfall', 'film', 'be', 'honest', 'sometimes', 'entertaining', 'kinda', 'expected', 'little', 'more', 'war', 'two', 'especially', 'three', 'writers', 'film', 'have', 'done', 'entertaining', 'films', 'past', 'may', 'be', 'indeed', 'be', 'problem', 'script', 'not', 'actors.To', 'be', 'honest', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'only', 'performing', 'what', 'page', 'DeVito', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'one', 'very', 'believable', 'role', 'Same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Broderick', 'who', 'type', 'could', 'be', 'up', 'tight', 'character', 'Everyone', 'film', 'do', 'good', 'jobs', 'wives', 'towns', 'people', 'Director', 'John', 'Whitesell', 'who', 'done', 'good', 'stuff', 'especially', 'TV', 'world', 'could', 'be', 'fault', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'helping', 'film', 'reach', 'full', 'potential.To', 'be', 'fair', 'film', 'not', 'horrible', 'can', 'be', 'entertaining', 'times', 'fact', 'good', 'natured', 'movie', 'cast', 'bring', 'something', 'needed', 'said', 'enjoyed', 'especially', 'what', 'going', 'right', 'now', 'do', 'recommend', 'movie', 'brain', 'off', 'rental', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'do', 'know', 'others', 'who', 'do', 'had', 'choose', 'would', 'say', 'am', 'one', 'who', 'do']",N/A

When Danny DeVito is on the television show 'The View' and expresses how much he hates this movie, you know you are in for a stinker.I never considered Matthew Broderick to be much of an actor. Nothing against the guy, I was just never a fan. His character is a conservative, nerdy optometrist who deems himself 'The Christmas Guy'. He is very much into traditions, much to his family's pain.So in comes 'Buddy' played by Danny DeVito. He gets it into his head that he wants a house that can be viewed from space. That's it. That is the only reason the plot moves forward and it is absurd. His hot twin daughters showed him an internet site which shows people's houses from space and his house cannot be seen. If you had a wife that looked like that would you really care?? But this is supposed to be a sappy Christmas story, so here we go.Matthew and Danny's characters begin to hate each other. Buddy does his house lights that would have made Clark W. Griswald green with envy. He also has a living manger complete with live cows, sheep, and a camel. Matthew is jealous and can't get any sleep at night, so he attempts to sabotage Buddy's electrical system, of course not only does Buddy have a large, noisy portable generator, he's stealing power from his own house to run his insane light show. The final straw comes when Dr. Finch tries to assault Buddy's house with illegal fireworks. The idiot can't even do that right.Of course the wives get tired of all the foolishness and go to a hotel for the holidays. Buddy and the good Doctor Finch decide to make up, bury the hatchet, and set things right with the wives. This is where it gets even more ridiculous than even I could have imagined.First off, they decorate the hotel with lights, and have huge Christmas light displays decorating a path back to the house. The town has become a ghost town at this point, the lights do not interfere with traffic, and there is NOBODY else to be seen anywhere. Then they get back to the houseand see that the two husbands have set up a lavish Christmas dinner. This is all very well and good, but come to find out they never eat it and I suppose everything goes bad. They do not eat it because no MTV is at Buddy's house wanting to do a story on the loser who wants his house seen from space.But of course now he has no lights on his house because he used them all to decorate a five mile path from the house to the hotel (I imagine that must have been wrecked when MTV News crews and the entire town show up all at once outside Buddy's door by the way). So ala 'It's a Wonderful Life', everyone donates lights to Buddy so he can redecorate his house.

Instead I now like DECK THE HALLS, which tells the story of a man obsessed with tradition, a man whose obsession with tradition threatens to destroy his family.  Such a man is Steve Finch, played by Matthew Broderick as an unhealthy shell of a man.  He's like a decrepit and deserted old house from whence the tenants have long since fled.  Nowhere in his eyes can you see the impudent spirit we loved him for in such vehicles as TORCH SONG TRILOGY or FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF.  Was it his long, tortured marriage to fellow teen stay Sarah Jessica Parker that has given Matthew Broderick that sallow, jaundiced countenance?If only Nathaniel Hawthorne was still alive he could have done the world a service by putting the noble ruin of the middle aged Broderick to good use, perhaps remembering his erstwhile glories as a star.  With his extensive stage background, and his father's fame too, he probably never envisioned a day when he would have to co-star opposite the tiny terror, Danny De Vito, and that the script would show Steve Finch sinking lower than the lowest depravities conjured up in the mind of Buddy Hall, the car salesman De Vito plays here.  My mother used to say, any movie with car salesmen in it has got to be bad, but I wish she were with us today (for many reasons, but among them is the chance to see a five star movie pitting a car salesman against an optometrist).  The two girls who plays De Vito's teenage twins do a heckuva job playing twins.  Every year since 2006 I watch them more closely, trying to detect the difference between them.  Guests have sworn on the Bible that the girls actually are twins, but it's hard to believe that in this day and age of modern photoshop, any filmmaker would cast real twins when disparate ones would do.

1097493,AATS9Q7VJ4PFI,B000UX798I,Kevin R. Austra,"[33, 48]","This film not only missed the mark, it missed the tournament.  DECK THE HALLS is a Christmas movie hopelessly in search of a genre.  The plot, which should have been simple, leans one way and then the other.  At times DECK THE HALLS seemed to be a ""Wanna Be"" with blatant similarities to other comedies such as RV, CHRISTMAS VACATION, and PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES.  Unfortunately the story trips over the holiday holly.In the story Buddy Hall (Danny DeVito) moves in across the street from Steve Finch (Matthew Broderick).  Finch is an upper middle class Massachusetts optometrist who holds the unofficial title as Mr. Christmas in his community.  Finch is de-throned by his neighbor when Hall coincidentally decides to adorn his own home with so many lights that it will be visible from outer space.  The gaudy Christmas display across the street only serves to push Finch over the edge.  Though visitors and reporters gleefully flock to Hall's ever brighter work-in-progress, Finch is not amused by the noise, bright lights, and traffic blocking his driveway.Finch loses his patience and attempts to sabotage Hall's efforts.  Finch's attempts not only backfire, but draw retaliation from Hall.  The obsessions of both men, Hall with his lights and Finch with toppling Hall, finally drive the two men's wives and children from their respective homes.  The neighbors realize that in their various selfish pursuits they ignored their families.  Finding something in common the two make peace, work together to lure their families back, and discover the Yule tide gift of friendship.Sorry folks. The plot summary is better than the actual film.  There were so many missed opportunities in this movie.  From the original theatrical trailer I mistakenly thought that this would be a movie about two neighbors competing against each other with holiday decorations.  That would have been a good premise.  The film could also have gone deeper into Buddy Hall's story.  Hall is a man who, as his wife explains in one scene, never finishes anything in his life. The holiday decorating obsession is just one example of Hall's misguided focus on something other than showing up for work every day.  With additional concentration on this theme there could have been an entire movie.  Instead it falls by the wayside.Likewise there is no depth to Matthew Broderick's character.  Nice family, beautiful home, promising career, spiteful neighbor.  The fact that he is irritated by his neighbor's lightshow is one thing, but it is difficult to believe that this otherwise stuffy traditionalist would dress up in commando garb and assault his new neighbor's electrical utility box.Unlike PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILE's main characters Del Griffith and Neal Page, Buddy Hall and Steve Finch are not nice people.  Any sympathy we have for dreamer Buddy Hall is dashed when we see that he swipes Finch's newspaper, illegally patches into Finch's own electrical box to steal power for his light show, and breaks into the Finch house to set up a stolen Christmas tree.  It then appears that Hall is trying to make amends by making a gift of a brand new SUV to Finch -- only to belatedly turn out that Finch is expected to pay for the expensive fully loaded vehicle.  Buddy Hall is no Del Griffith.Finch is no angel either.  When he is not planning commando-style raids on his neighbor's holiday lights he is bombarding the Hall home with an arsenal of fireworks.  His negative comments to Hall about Hall's outer space dream are just plain mean.  In terms of civility Steve Finch is no Neal Page.There are some isolated funny moments in this film.  I did enjoy the scenes involving Hall's over-decorated home.  Otherwise this movie goes nowhere.  An added disappointment was that the wide screen version of my movie has a repeated chapter.  The runaway Santa Claus sled and its aftermath appear twice.  If my DVD bears that defect there are probably hundreds others with the same malady.",1,Forget the Halls,1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,3972,"['film', 'not', 'only', 'missed', 'mark', 'missed', 'tournament', 'DECK', 'THE', 'HALLS', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'hopelessly', 'search', 'genre', 'plot', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'simple', 'one', 'way', 'then', 'other', 'times', 'DECK', 'THE', 'HALLS', 'seemed', 'be', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', 'blatant', 'similarities', 'other', 'comedies', 'such', 'RV', 'CHRISTMAS', 'VACATION', 'PLANES', 'TRAINS', 'AND', 'AUTOMOBILES', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'holiday', 'holly.In', 'story', 'Buddy', 'Hall', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'street', 'Steve', 'Finch', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Finch', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'Massachusetts', 'optometrist', 'who', 'unofficial', 'title', 'Mr.', 'Christmas', 'community', 'Finch', 'de-throned', 'neighbor', 'when', 'Hall', 'coincidentally', 'adorn', 'own', 'home', 'so', 'many', 'lights', 'will', 'be', 'visible', 'outer', 'space', 'gaudy', 'Christmas', 'display', 'street', 'only', 'push', 'Finch', 'edge', 'visitors', 'reporters', 'gleefully', 'flock', 'Hall', 'ever', 'brighter', 'work-in-progress', 'Finch', 'not', 'amused', 'noise', 'bright', 'lights', 'traffic', 'blocking', 'driveway.Finch', 'patience', 'attempts', 'sabotage', 'Hall', 'efforts', 'Finch', 'attempts', 'not', 'only', 'backfire', 'draw', 'retaliation', 'Hall', 'obsessions', 'men', 'Hall', 'lights', 'Finch', 'toppling', 'Hall', 'finally', 'drive', 'two', 'men', 'wives', 'children', 'respective', 'homes', 'neighbors', 'realize', 'various', 'selfish', 'pursuits', 'ignored', 'families', 'Finding', 'something', 'common', 'two', 'make', 'peace', 'work', 'together', 'lure', 'families', 'back', 'discover', 'Yule', 'gift', 'friendship.Sorry', 'folks', 'plot', 'summary', 'better', 'actual', 'film', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'movie', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'mistakenly', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'two', 'neighbors', 'competing', 'other', 'holiday', 'decorations', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'premise', 'film', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'gone', 'deeper', 'Buddy', 'Hall', 'story', 'Hall', 'man', 'who', 'wife', 'one', 'scene', 'never', 'anything', 'life', 'holiday', 'decorating', 'obsession', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'Hall', 'misguided', 'focus', 'something', 'other', 'showing', 'up', 'work', 'day', 'additional', 'concentration', 'theme', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'entire', 'movie', 'Instead', 'wayside.Likewise', 'depth', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'character', 'Nice', 'family', 'beautiful', 'home', 'promising', 'career', 'spiteful', 'neighbor', 'fact', 'irritated', 'neighbor', 'lightshow', 'one', 'thing', 'difficult', 'believe', 'otherwise', 'stuffy', 'traditionalist', 'would', 'dress', 'up', 'commando', 'garb', 'assault', 'new', 'neighbor', 'electrical', 'utility', 'box.Unlike', 'PLANES', 'TRAINS', 'AND', 'AUTOMOBILE', 'main', 'characters', 'Del', 'Griffith', 'Neal', 'Page', 'Buddy', 'Hall', 'Steve', 'Finch', 'are', 'not', 'nice', 'people', 'sympathy', 'have', 'dreamer', 'Buddy', 'Hall', 'dashed', 'when', 'see', 'Finch', 'newspaper', 'illegally', 'Finch', 'own', 'electrical', 'box', 'steal', 'power', 'light', 'show', 'breaks', 'Finch', 'house', 'set', 'up', 'stolen', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'then', 'Hall', 'trying', 'make', 'amends', 'making', 'gift', 'brand', 'new', 'SUV', 'Finch', 'only', 'belatedly', 'turn', 'out', 'Finch', 'expected', 'pay', 'expensive', 'fully', 'loaded', 'vehicle', 'Buddy', 'Hall', 'Del', 'Griffith.Finch', 'angel', 'either', 'When', 'not', 'planning', 'commando-style', 'raids', 'neighbor', 'holiday', 'lights', 'bombarding', 'Hall', 'home', 'arsenal', 'fireworks', 'negative', 'comments', 'Hall', 'Hall', 'outer', 'space', 'dream', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'mean', 'terms', 'civility', 'Steve', 'Finch', 'Neal', 'Page.There', 'are', 'isolated', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'did', 'enjoy', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Hall', 'over-decorated', 'home', 'Otherwise', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'added', 'disappointment', 'was', 'wide', 'screen', 'version', 'movie', 'repeated', 'chapter', 'runaway', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'sled', 'aftermath', 'twice', 'DVD', 'defect', 'are', 'probably', 'hundreds', 'others', 'same', 'malady']",N/A
1097494,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000UX798I,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 11]","There are two reasons to see ""Deck the Halls,"" and those two reasons would not be the stars Danny DeVito and Matthew Broderick. This 2006 Christmas comedy was apparently inspired by ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,"" or the episodes of ""Home Improvement"" where Tim tries to outdo the neighbor's Christmas display, or any other movie or television show that is based on the oxymoronic notion of cut-throat decorating at Christmas time, none of which is enough to warrant seeing this film either, especially if you can get your hands on one of those others instead. But still, there are a couple of reasons to check this movie out nonetheless.Steve Finch (Broderick) is not only the town's eye doctor, he is also Mr. Christmas. However, Buddy Hall (DeVito) has moved in across the street and when he learns that his house cannot be seen from space by an online site that is mapping the Earth, he decides the solution is to deck his house with every Christmas tree light he can get his hands on. Broderick and DeVito can do these roles in their sleep, or at least in low gear, and the script never gives them any reason to rev up their performances. As their respective wives, Kirstin Davis and Kristen Chenoweth, also have little to do until Chenoweth finally gets to sing near the end and serve as a reminder that you just cannot make a living being a singing star on Broadway these days. However, I keep thinking they cast her because she is approximately DeVito's size, setting up the visual humor of their tall blond twin daughters, and not because she is a talented Broadway musicale actress. For that matter, Davis is just spinning her wheels waiting for the ""Sex in the City"" movie to give her something decent to do.This is not a particularly funny movie, also hindered by the fact that neither of the main characters are the types you want to identify with, especially in from of family members. However, there are two things this movie--whose winter night scenes were primarily shot during the day in summer (see the special features for the explanation)--got right. The first is that the light display is absolutely awesome. I have seen some impressive things on YouTube and the nightly news showing us what some people have come up with for Christmas in years past, but I do not remember anything coming close to the spectacular light show they came up with for this movie. The least you can do is put this on while you are cooking Christmas dinner and actually watch the part when Buddy puts on the light show for the neighbors.

In part because I like Christmas, but also because I like to see how Christmas and our celebration of it is portrayed over time. It's gone from a reverential celebration of religion and family to a funny(or not) analysis of modern obsessive behavior and over-consumption. Then there are movies like these, which are just time killers. This is Christmas as Product.It has a few watchable moments. Kristin Chenowith is plenty hot as always and gets to sing a teeny little bit and Kristin Davis is the most adorable lil mannequin come-to-life since her SATC partner originated that act years ago. There is one bit in particular which made me laugh. It's horrible and if you're a father you should hope it never happens to you. I won't ruin it for you but I will say in the next scene DeVito and Broderick are in a church washing their eyes out with holy water, with good reason. It's one of the few scenes that show any signs of life, which is too bad because this thing could have used many more.Mostly though the movie is lackluster. It doesn't have the manic energy of a Christmas Vacation or the heart warming nostalgia of Christmas Story or the black, outrageous humor of Bad Santa or the child-like joy and goofiness of Elf. It has a few badly paced jokes and more than its share of sleep walking actors. The pace and performances were so slow and half hearted that I felt like I was watching the entire movie through a Valium induced haze.The movie has no real heart or message, or insight and it's not very funny.

Steve is determined to deliver the traditional Christmas to his family and his town in an attempt to provide for his family what he never got from his own. Everything is going OK until his new neighbor Buddy Hall (Danny DeVito) and his family move in across the street. Buddy is unconventional in most ways and begins looking to unseat Steve from his position as the towns ""Christmas guy"". Adventure ensues.It doesn't usually take much to make a watchable Christmas movie. Even Christmas movies that are just OK are still watchable. This movie however failed in almost everyway possible and is probably one of the worst Christmas movies ever made.The Good: The only redeeming feature of this movie was the light display that DeVito's character installs on his house. According to the special features it was all actually done with LCD lights with no CG involved. It was pretty amazing.The Bad: To start with the acting. Most of the performances were OK however Mathew Broderick's was terrible. It was almost like watching a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit where the characters are pretending to act in a satirical manner in order to make fun of actors. It was terrible. With his character playing the lead and his performance being so weak the rest of the movie is a tough sell.The story overall was completely thin with very under developed characters. The attempts at humor were all trite at best and ridiculous at worst eliciting at best a giggle here and there while watching. Everything that is intended to be funny is predictable and I didn't see any original ideas or new takes on old ideas. Every clich&eacute; idea and theme that has ever been put into a Christmas movie has been collected and forced into this movie complete with the hackneyed ""Everyone has put their differences aside and become friends for the good of all"" ending.Overall: I had high hopes for this movie since I am always looking for the next great Christmas movie but this film failed miserably.

1097514,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000UX798I,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[10, 23]","Deck the Halls (John Whitesell, 2006)I can't be 100% sure of the tale I'm about to spin you, but it makes sense within the parameters of the movie in question. It is a tale of great and terrible woe that involves two idealistic and quite brilliant screenwriters who make a deal with certain dark forces who twist their requests in the worst possible manner.The two screenwriters are named Chris Ord and Matt Corman, and Deck the Halls was their first baby. So they made a deal with the devil, sold their very souls to get this movie made. And the devil, realizing there was a loophole, set Ord and Corman up with screenwriter Don Rhymer and director John Whitesell, the ""creative"" team who brought you such deathless cinema as Big Momma's House 2 and Malibu's Most Wanted. The end result is, as one might expect, painful, but there are still desperately futile glimmers of what was once a brilliant script within the wreckage.Steve Finch (Matthew Broderick), a small-town optometrist, is obsessed with showing his family the meaning of Christmas through building both his family's and the town's traditions. All is going fairly well until Buddy Hall (Danny DeVito) moves in next door. Buddy's only nod to the Christmas tradition is his desire to have the lights from his house so bright that the house can be seen from space. The glow, and the resultant tourism it attracts, quickly go beyond the bounds of mere annoyance, and Steve finds himself coming up with ever more ridiculous plans to get the lights turned off.It's immensely stupid, as presented, a thoroughly awful movie without a single redeeming quality. And yet, still, there's something under the hood. The movie sets up just about every stupid-comedy character stereotype, then proceeds, within minutes, to demolish almost all of them (ironically, the only two characters who stay as stereotypes throughout the film are Broderick's and DeVito's). Ill-timed jokes were so transparently inserted late in the shooting that it's simply not possible they were part of the original script. Little details of character and subplot survive. There was much potential here, and a great deal of it was wasted; interesting characters that could have made this a wonderful film are never developed, with the director instead opting to churn out a typical below-average movie aimed at making a quick buck in the first week of release. I can only hope someone eventually salvages the original script and makes the movie this, seemingly, should have been. * ",1,So much potential so desperately wasted.,1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,2506,"['Deck', 'Halls', 'John', 'Whitesell', '2006', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', '100', '%', 'sure', 'tale', ""'m"", 'spin', 'sense', 'parameters', 'movie', 'question', 'tale', 'great', 'terrible', 'woe', 'two', 'idealistic', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'screenwriters', 'who', 'make', 'deal', 'certain', 'dark', 'forces', 'who', 'twist', 'requests', 'worst', 'possible', 'manner.The', 'two', 'screenwriters', 'are', 'named', 'Chris', 'Ord', 'Matt', 'Corman', 'Deck', 'Halls', 'was', 'first', 'baby', 'made', 'deal', 'devil', 'sold', 'very', 'souls', 'get', 'movie', 'made', 'devil', 'realizing', 'was', 'loophole', 'set', 'Ord', 'Corman', 'up', 'screenwriter', 'Don', 'Rhymer', 'director', 'John', 'Whitesell', 'creative', 'team', 'who', 'brought', 'such', 'deathless', 'cinema', 'Big', 'Momma', 'House', '2', 'Malibu', 'Most', 'Wanted', 'end', 'result', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'painful', 'are', 'still', 'desperately', 'futile', 'glimmers', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'brilliant', 'script', 'wreckage.Steve', 'Finch', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'small-town', 'optometrist', 'obsessed', 'showing', 'family', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'building', 'family', 'town', 'traditions', 'going', 'fairly', 'well', 'Buddy', 'Hall', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'next', 'door', 'Buddy', 'only', 'Christmas', 'tradition', 'desire', 'have', 'lights', 'house', 'so', 'bright', 'house', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'space', 'glow', 'resultant', 'tourism', 'quickly', 'go', 'bounds', 'mere', 'annoyance', 'Steve', 'coming', 'up', 'ever', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'plans', 'get', 'lights', 'turned', 'off.It', 'immensely', 'stupid', 'presented', 'thoroughly', 'awful', 'movie', 'single', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'yet', 'still', 'something', 'hood', 'movie', 'up', 'just', 'stupid-comedy', 'character', 'stereotype', 'then', 'proceeds', 'minutes', 'demolish', 'almost', 'ironically', 'only', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'stay', 'stereotypes', 'film', 'are', 'Broderick', 'DeVito', 'Ill-timed', 'jokes', 'were', 'so', 'transparently', 'inserted', 'late', 'shooting', 'simply', 'not', 'possible', 'were', 'part', 'original', 'script', 'Little', 'details', 'character', 'subplot', 'survive', 'was', 'much', 'potential', 'here', 'great', 'deal', 'was', 'wasted', 'interesting', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'wonderful', 'film', 'are', 'never', 'developed', 'director', 'instead', 'opting', 'churn', 'out', 'typical', 'below-average', 'movie', 'aimed', 'making', 'quick', 'buck', 'first', 'week', 'release', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'someone', 'eventually', 'original', 'script', 'movie', 'seemingly', 'should', 'have', 'been', '*']",N/A

""Deck the Halls"" isn't that bad and there were a number of real funny lines, mostly attributed to Danny DeVito.The story is about a car salesman, - and once again the cliche, sleezy and so forth -, Danny DeVito as Buddy Hall, who moves with his family to this small town and gets the idea that he wants to do something extraordinary, ... he wants his house to be seen from outer space through some sort of Website that tracks the brightest spots on earth. To accomplish his pursuit he buys as many lights that he can find to decorate his house. This is very annoying to his neighbor, played by Matthew Broderick, who is supposed to be the authority on Christmas in this small town and who loves a traditional Christmas instead of the circus that Buddy Hall puts into motion.Well, as said, there are some funny lines in this film, and maybe a not so hidden message, that being with the family and the value of a family is more important than the details of the Christmas rush. I didn't find this movie too hillarious as it seems like that there's something missing, but it sure beats ""Christmas with the Kranks"" from last year by a mile.
