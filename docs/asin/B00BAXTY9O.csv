1623702,A189VV6P4IZJXI,B00BAXTY9O,Anthony McGill,"[0, 0]","Season eight and the second year of one hour episodes.  Nineteen marvellous episodes and it should be noted that while most westerns  very much depicted the man's vision of the west, ""Gunsmoke"" was one the few which presented strong female roles with actresses scoring top billing in half of the shows in this collection.Old reliables John Meston and Kathleen Hite wrote fourteen of the episodes and Harry Harris Jr. and Andrew V. McLaglen  directed seventeen between them giving the series a continuing high standard which was to remain throughout its entire longevity.The role of Quint Asper, played by Burt Reynolds, joined the cast in episode three to bolster the already strong ensemble of James Arness, Dennis Weaver, Amanda Blake and Milburn Stone.  Another interesting character also appeared: it was the first entrance of Festus Haggen played by Ken Curtis.  The latter, one of the Sons of the Pioneers and a regular in John Ford movies, had appeared in quite a number of previous episodes but never as Festus. As we all know Festus would be a permanent staple in years to come and fill the gap of quirkiness when Weaver's Chester departed the series.A great bunch of guests appeared in this selection of shows including  Kathy Nolan, Virginia Gregg, John Dehner, Joanne Linville, Robert Middleton, Ruta Lee, Strother Martin, Chill Wills, Claude Akins, William Windom, Audrey Dalton, Joyce Bulifant, J. Pat O'Malley, Denver Pyle, Sherry Jackson and Mariette Hartley.One highlight episode: ""Root Down"" where Chester is kidnapped, bound and gagged and destined to be a reluctant bridegroom!A great series that has never grown tiresome.",5,BURT REYNOLDS JOINS A GREAT CAST,1405987200,"07 22, 2014",2014,1642,"['Season', 'eight', 'second', 'year', 'one', 'hour', 'episodes', 'Nineteen', 'marvellous', 'episodes', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'most', 'westerns', 'very', 'much', 'depicted', 'man', 'vision', 'west', 'Gunsmoke', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'presented', 'strong', 'female', 'roles', 'actresses', 'scoring', 'top', 'billing', 'half', 'shows', 'collection.Old', 'John', 'Meston', 'Kathleen', 'Hite', 'wrote', 'fourteen', 'episodes', 'Harry', 'Harris', 'Jr.', 'Andrew', 'V.', 'McLaglen', 'directed', 'seventeen', 'giving', 'series', 'continuing', 'high', 'standard', 'was', 'remain', 'entire', 'longevity.The', 'role', 'Quint', 'Asper', 'played', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'joined', 'cast', 'episode', 'three', 'bolster', 'already', 'strong', 'ensemble', 'James', 'Arness', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'Amanda', 'Blake', 'Milburn', 'Stone', 'interesting', 'character', 'also', 'appeared', 'was', 'first', 'entrance', 'Festus', 'Haggen', 'played', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'latter', 'one', 'Sons', 'Pioneers', 'regular', 'John', 'Ford', 'movies', 'had', 'appeared', 'quite', 'number', 'previous', 'episodes', 'never', 'Festus', 'know', 'Festus', 'would', 'be', 'permanent', 'staple', 'years', 'come', 'fill', 'gap', 'quirkiness', 'when', 'Weaver', 'Chester', 'departed', 'series.A', 'great', 'bunch', 'guests', 'appeared', 'selection', 'shows', 'including', 'Kathy', 'Nolan', 'Virginia', 'Gregg', 'John', 'Dehner', 'Joanne', 'Linville', 'Robert', 'Middleton', 'Ruta', 'Lee', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'Chill', 'Wills', 'Claude', 'Akins', 'William', 'Windom', 'Audrey', 'Dalton', 'Joyce', 'Bulifant', 'J.', 'Pat', ""O'Malley"", 'Denver', 'Pyle', 'Sherry', 'Jackson', 'Mariette', 'Hartley.One', 'highlight', 'episode', 'Root', 'Down', 'where', 'Chester', 'kidnapped', 'bound', 'gagged', 'destined', 'be', 'reluctant', 'bridegroom', 'great', 'series', 'never', 'grown', 'tiresome']","Gunsmoke: Season 8, Vol. 1"

This is due to the high quality of the audio and video and to the fact that both were among a handful of the very best TV westerns ever produced.  However, I have been having chronic problems playing these discs on my Panasonic DVD Recorder, which functions both as a DVD player and recorder.  Almost every set has at least one disc that will not even start and is rejected by the machine as ""incompatible.""  Sometimes I am able to get them to play by repeatedly opening and closing the disc drawer.  I do not have this problem with any other discs that I've purchased or burned myself.

We especially enjoy the early films with Dennis Weaver and his limp.  Most fans wanted Matt and Miss Kitty to marry but that was not to be.
