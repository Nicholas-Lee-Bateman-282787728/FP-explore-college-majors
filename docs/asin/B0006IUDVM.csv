869643,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0006IUDVM,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[2, 2]","I am a little disappointed that The Jamie Kennedy Experiment only lasted three years, but I guess the positive thing is that it never became old.  In its third and final season, the theme of the year was Road Trip; pretty much every week took place in a different city.  One week was Miami, the next was Jamie's home town of Philidelphia, and the next was Chicago (my home town!).  Each town presented unique opportunites for experiments.  The Miami show had two hilarious bits: one involved a marine research center where they tricked an intern into believing that scientists had created a device that could translate dolphin noises into English (the producer provided the voice of the dolphin, and he said some hilarious things).  The other one had Jamie and a child actor going to a Miami Dolphins practice session so that the kid could play with some of his favorite Dolphins.  However, Jamie, who played the kid's dad, smacked the kid around and tried to get all the attention from the players for himself.The Chicago show was also amazing.  They set up a man (who is actually my Dad's old secretary's brother!) at Mike Ditka's restaurant.  The guy idolizes Ditka, and they made it seem as if Jamie bought the restaurant and made Ditka his personal assistant.  In another bit in Chicago, Jamie played a buggy driver who got into a jousting match with a rival buggy driver!  It was so funny, and it ended really nice because there was a couple in the buggy.  The guy knew what was going on, but his girlfriend didn't, and at the end, he proposed to her.In Philly, Jamie got to participate (and cheat) in a cheese steak  eating contest, and he even got to ""X"" his parents.This was a great final season for a hilarious reality show.  While I detest a good 99% of reality programming (The Amazing Race is good), this was the rare exception that I could not only tolerate, but enjoy.  We not be getting X'ed anymore, but we'll always have these DVD sets.",5,Jamie's Final Season,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,1954,"['am', 'little', 'disappointed', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'Experiment', 'only', 'lasted', 'three', 'years', 'guess', 'positive', 'thing', 'never', 'became', 'old', 'third', 'final', 'season', 'theme', 'year', 'was', 'Road', 'Trip', 'pretty', 'much', 'week', 'took', 'place', 'different', 'city', 'One', 'week', 'was', 'Miami', 'next', 'was', 'Jamie', 'home', 'town', 'Philidelphia', 'next', 'was', 'Chicago', 'home', 'town', 'town', 'presented', 'unique', 'opportunites', 'experiments', 'Miami', 'show', 'had', 'two', 'hilarious', 'bits', 'one', 'involved', 'marine', 'research', 'center', 'where', 'tricked', 'intern', 'believing', 'scientists', 'had', 'created', 'device', 'could', 'translate', 'dolphin', 'noises', 'English', 'producer', 'provided', 'voice', 'dolphin', 'said', 'hilarious', 'things', 'other', 'one', 'had', 'Jamie', 'child', 'actor', 'going', 'Miami', 'Dolphins', 'practice', 'session', 'so', 'kid', 'could', 'play', 'favorite', 'Dolphins', 'However', 'Jamie', 'who', 'played', 'kid', 'dad', 'smacked', 'kid', 'around', 'tried', 'get', 'attention', 'players', 'himself.The', 'Chicago', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'amazing', 'set', 'up', 'man', 'who', 'actually', 'Dad', 'old', 'secretary', 'brother', 'Mike', 'Ditka', 'restaurant', 'guy', 'Ditka', 'made', 'seem', 'Jamie', 'bought', 'restaurant', 'made', 'Ditka', 'personal', 'assistant', 'bit', 'Chicago', 'Jamie', 'played', 'buggy', 'driver', 'who', 'got', 'jousting', 'match', 'rival', 'buggy', 'driver', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'ended', 'really', 'nice', 'was', 'couple', 'buggy', 'guy', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'girlfriend', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'proposed', 'her.In', 'Philly', 'Jamie', 'got', 'participate', 'cheat', 'cheese', 'steak', 'eating', 'contest', 'even', 'got', 'X', 'parents.This', 'was', 'great', 'final', 'season', 'hilarious', 'reality', 'show', 'detest', 'good', '99', '%', 'reality', 'programming', 'Amazing', 'Race', 'good', 'was', 'rare', 'exception', 'could', 'not', 'only', 'tolerate', 'enjoy', 'not', 'be', 'getting', ""X'ed"", 'anymore', ""'ll"", 'always', 'have', 'DVD', 'sets']",N/A

869647,A1K31NF81TS0CO,B0006IUDVM,"Dubyac99 ""Dubyac99""","[1, 1]","This is the third and final season of this series.  I was not disappointed.  I have to admit, though, I stopped watching it on television about half way through the season, as the bits were getting a bit tired.  Same kind of routines.  Thus, a 4 star instead of 5 stars.However, after purchasing and watching this season, I will say, it still had a certain freshness absent from many other ""reality"" shows, such as ""Punk'd"" or that other show, where you have to do extreme challenges, can't remember the name right now.This show continues to get laughs due to the bizarre things they get people to do.  Some of the funnier segments include one where a person being ""X'd"" believes he is showing up for a Male Modeling position for a new product called ""Manties,"" male panties.  The underwear has frilly laces on the back.  He then proceeds to parade around on a cat walk, to the evident excitement of Jamie playing a very fruity producer.  Jamie's ""assistants"" almost steal the scene.  Great two-bit acting.  Don't miss when the CEO/Financer shows up, and starts demonstrating the proper way to shake on the Catwalk.One of the more interesting segments, and I'm really glad Jamie had the guts to include this one, shows him onstage, in front of many people ""being fooled"" except that at least one person in the audience keeps recognizing him as Jamie Kennedy, and ""outing"" him.  So they keep repeating the segment, dressing Jamie up, even more ridiculously, and he keeps being recognized.  Finally, after the 4th attempt, they put a brown paper bag on his head, and the segment goes fine.It was interesting to watch this one, because it answers that nagging question:  How many times do they have to do a ""bit"" before they get a funny one filmed. I, unlike some, cynically believe they must do it 3 or 4 times every time, before they get a funny one.  After all, this ""ad-lib camera stuff"" is a lot harder than it looks.I think a funny one, that they didn't include, would be one, where they fool ""us"" the audience.  As it always felt funny watching this, wondering if ""we"" were being led to believe something that wasn't true.I think it is lacking on special features, but this isn't new information (see my other reviews for earlier seasons.)  I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
