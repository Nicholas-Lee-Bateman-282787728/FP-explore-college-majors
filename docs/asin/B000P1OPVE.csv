I really liked this one. A boy and a girl have been best friends since childhood. Everybody around them knows that they love each other and should be a couple - except them! What makes this a better movie than most, is that all the details are really original. Just as one example: She wants to be an actress but she is too shy to act! Lots of creativity and originality.",5,This one is an original! - Loved it!,1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,559,"['Amazon', 'Prime', 'got', 'pretty', 'good', 'selection', 'free', 'Korean', 'Movies', 'like', 'Romantic', 'Comedies', 'general', 'so', 'snowy', 'hills', 'Northern', 'NY', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'few', 'really', 'liked', 'one', 'boy', 'girl', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'friends', 'childhood', 'Everybody', 'love', 'other', 'should', 'be', 'couple', 'What', 'better', 'movie', 'most', 'details', 'are', 'really', 'original', 'Just', 'one', 'example', 'be', 'actress', 'too', 'shy', 'act', 'Lots', 'creativity', 'originality']",N/A
