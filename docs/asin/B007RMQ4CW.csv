1537130,A315R030KOP73P,B007RMQ4CW,Alexander Miley,"[2, 2]","That's not a question that first pops into one's mind when taking the final season solely by itself. But certainly, when compared with the earliest episodes of season one, Designing Women has, by the series finale, jumped off the tracks and ran amok. There are some bright spots to be had! I still maintain that Jan Hooks was an absolute coup for the last couple of seasons of Designing Women. When she's good, she's great and she really has a knack for stealing the spotlight in her scenes. Her characterizations of iconic Gone With the Wind characters in the series finale, for example, is a riot! Alice Ghostley, with the show since the very beginning, takes the time among the inane plots and cartoon-ish situations of season seven to simply do her thing and it's such fun to watch. I would call Bernice, played by Ghostley, the steam behind the final season, the last original element that still maintains the enjoyable quality viewers fell in love with. The saddest thing about these last episodes is the characters of Mary Jo Shively and Julia Sugarbaker. Gone is the spot-on writing, crisp dialogue and effortless humor of yesteryear. The last of the original lead characters have been replaced with shrill caricatures of their original selves. Julia's Terminator alter ego is cranked up to the highest degree and, instead of cheering her on, I now find myself tuning her out. The same with Mary Jo, whose neuroses has risen so much, she spends a majority of season seven running around the set and screaming. Judith Ivey as BJ Poteet is largely forgettable and Meshach Taylor as Anthony is saddled with a season long subplot that is, quite frankly, subpar. The finale is tolerable and, as a send off into the great beyond of classic TV, is certainly fitting. However, it's an average goodbye and more time and heart could have been poured into the final hour. All in all, season seven is for completists and Jan Hooks fans only! Everyone else, move right along and revisit the original episodes. There's a reason Designing Women is classic comedy television! Sadly, this final season is not it.",3,Is This the Same Show?,1375488000,"08 3, 2013",2013,2103,"['not', 'question', 'first', 'pops', 'one', 'mind', 'when', 'taking', 'final', 'season', 'solely', 'certainly', 'when', 'compared', 'earliest', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'Designing', 'Women', 'series', 'finale', 'jumped', 'off', 'tracks', 'ran', 'amok', 'are', 'bright', 'spots', 'be', 'had', 'still', 'maintain', 'Jan', 'Hooks', 'was', 'absolute', 'coup', 'last', 'couple', 'seasons', 'Designing', 'Women', 'When', 'good', 'great', 'really', 'knack', 'stealing', 'spotlight', 'scenes', 'characterizations', 'iconic', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'characters', 'series', 'finale', 'example', 'riot', 'Alice', 'Ghostley', 'show', 'very', 'beginning', 'time', 'inane', 'plots', 'cartoon-ish', 'situations', 'season', 'seven', 'simply', 'do', 'thing', 'such', 'fun', 'watch', 'would', 'call', 'Bernice', 'played', 'Ghostley', 'steam', 'final', 'season', 'last', 'original', 'element', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'quality', 'viewers', 'fell', 'love', 'saddest', 'thing', 'last', 'episodes', 'characters', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'Shively', 'Julia', 'Sugarbaker', 'Gone', 'spot-on', 'writing', 'crisp', 'dialogue', 'effortless', 'humor', 'yesteryear', 'last', 'original', 'lead', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'shrill', 'caricatures', 'original', 'selves', 'Julia', 'Terminator', 'alter', 'ego', 'cranked', 'highest', 'degree', 'instead', 'cheering', 'now', 'find', 'tuning', 'out', 'same', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'neuroses', 'risen', 'so', 'much', 'majority', 'season', 'seven', 'running', 'around', 'set', 'screaming', 'Judith', 'Ivey', 'BJ', 'Poteet', 'largely', 'forgettable', 'Meshach', 'Taylor', 'Anthony', 'saddled', 'season', 'long', 'subplot', 'quite', 'frankly', 'subpar', 'finale', 'tolerable', 'send', 'off', 'great', 'classic', 'TV', 'certainly', 'fitting', 'However', 'average', 'goodbye', 'more', 'time', 'heart', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'poured', 'final', 'hour', 'season', 'seven', 'completists', 'Jan', 'Hooks', 'fans', 'only', 'Everyone', 'else', 'move', 'right', 'along', 'revisit', 'original', 'episodes', 'reason', 'Designing', 'Women', 'classic', 'comedy', 'television', 'Sadly', 'final', 'season', 'not']",Designing Women: The Final Season

I loved the addition of BJ, as well as Anthony's new wife. BJ is a client that sticks around and is hilarious, rich, and (Texan?). Then, Carlene is still on. With these three characters they contribute to the comedy of the amazing and masterful acting of the beloved Dixie Carter and Annie Potts.I'd like to address some of the other reviewers' comments. Yes, it is true that Delta Burke and Jean Smart are gone. And yes, they were fantastic and part of the dynamic quartet that drove the show.

I always enjoyed the characters, especially the quirky Bernice played by Alice Ghostley. The DVD set is well done, the quality of the picture is excellent and the series as funny as I remember it.  I highly recommend this show.  The series is about sassy, funny and hilarious interior designers at the Sugarbaker's design firm in Atlanta, Georgia.

The absence of Delta Burke and Jean Smart spelled doom for the series, if it hadnt been ending otherwise.  But, if  you love the show, then you have to have the last season, right?  Even if not the best season, it's still fun and enjoyable TV.  I was afraid they wouldn't finish releasing the series, as they've done with other classic TV shows (still waiting on the last 2 seasons of the Bob Newhart Show, for example).

1537136,ADVRSHBI35H97,B007RMQ4CW,"James Donovan ""movie lover""","[6, 6]","Not having seen this since it originally aired 20 years ago(!), my memory of this season was, to put it mildly, a little hazy. The only episode I actually remembered was the Gone With The Wind spoof two-parter that served as the show's swan song. My other recollection was that I liked the addition of Judith Ivey and I thought overall that this was a better season than the previous one. So now it feels like I'm watching it again for the first time. And here's what I've deduced.1) Season Six Was Better. As much as Julia Duffy's character (an extension of her Newhart role) was universally hated, overall I felt Season Six had better stories and better laughs. In contrast the first six episodes of Season Seven are dreadful, but if you make it through those, things definitely improve. And in retrospect, Duffy really wasn't that bad in Season Six, she was simply stuck with an unlikable Suzanne-filler that she couldn't do much with. The character of Carlene was much more successful. Which leads me to,2) B.J. was a good move (in theory.) As I mentioned before, I thought bringing in Judith Ivey was great, in that she made B.J. a warm, believable character who brought some much needed sass to the show. The drawback was, like Alison, B.J. didn't really have much to besides butt heads with Julia, but she definitely was a better fit for the show.3) Julia Becomes A Joke. What I mean by that is Julia Sugarbaker is no longer herself. What started out as the most level-headed character devolved into a parody. Julia Sugarbaker joining in an impromptu Motown routine in a hospital room? I don't think so! Even Dixie Carter seemed to poke fun at herself, and that was disappointing. This character decline started around the sixth season, but this season is the most obvious.So, in conclusion, it's probably a good thing that this was the final season, though a proper send off would have been nice. In all, this was certainly a watchable season, but the bloom had worn off for this series, making one feel nostalgic for the earlier seasons and cast members.",3,The End Is Here.,1349136000,"10 2, 2012",2012,2063,"['Not', 'having', 'seen', 'originally', 'aired', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'memory', 'season', 'was', 'put', 'mildly', 'little', 'hazy', 'only', 'episode', 'actually', 'remembered', 'was', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'spoof', 'two-parter', 'served', 'show', 'swan', 'song', 'other', 'recollection', 'was', 'liked', 'addition', 'Judith', 'Ivey', 'thought', 'overall', 'was', 'better', 'season', 'previous', 'one', 'So', 'now', ""'m"", 'watching', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'here', 'what', ""'ve"", 'deduced.1', 'Season', 'Six', 'Was', 'Better', 'As', 'much', 'Julia', 'Duffy', 'character', 'extension', 'Newhart', 'role', 'was', 'universally', 'hated', 'overall', 'felt', 'Season', 'Six', 'had', 'better', 'stories', 'better', 'laughs', 'contrast', 'first', 'six', 'episodes', 'Season', 'Seven', 'are', 'dreadful', 'make', 'things', 'definitely', 'improve', 'retrospect', 'Duffy', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Season', 'Six', 'was', 'simply', 'stuck', 'unlikable', 'Suzanne-filler', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'character', 'Carlene', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'Which', 'to,2', 'B.J', 'was', 'good', 'move', 'theory', 'mentioned', 'thought', 'bringing', 'Judith', 'Ivey', 'was', 'great', 'made', 'B.J', 'warm', 'believable', 'character', 'who', 'brought', 'much', 'needed', 'sass', 'show', 'drawback', 'was', 'Alison', 'B.J', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'besides', 'butt', 'heads', 'Julia', 'definitely', 'was', 'better', 'fit', 'show.3', 'Julia', 'Joke', 'What', 'mean', 'Julia', 'Sugarbaker', 'no', 'longer', 'What', 'started', 'out', 'most', 'level-headed', 'character', 'devolved', 'parody', 'Julia', 'Sugarbaker', 'joining', 'impromptu', 'Motown', 'routine', 'hospital', 'room', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Even', 'Dixie', 'Carter', 'seemed', 'poke', 'fun', 'was', 'disappointing', 'character', 'decline', 'started', 'sixth', 'season', 'season', 'most', 'obvious.So', 'conclusion', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'was', 'final', 'season', 'proper', 'send', 'off', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'was', 'certainly', 'watchable', 'season', 'bloom', 'had', 'worn', 'off', 'series', 'making', 'one', 'feel', 'nostalgic', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'cast', 'members']",Designing Women: The Final Season
1537137,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B007RMQ4CW,Kasey G,"[26, 29]","This July, one of the most beloved, well-crafted, character-driven sitcoms will finally be complete on DVD thanks to Shout Factory, when Season 7 of ""Designing Women"" is released.In 1992 ""Designing Women"" was coming off its highest ratings in the series' history following the replacement of half the cast, including the show's big breakout character. A remarkable achievement in lieu of the fact that one of the replacements was very poorly received by audiences. The producers decided to let Julia Duffy go because they felt the show was tarnished by such an unlikeable character. In the years since, it seems unanimous that it was the writing and NOT Duffy's performance that caused the backlash.For Season 7, veteran stage/character actress Judith Ivey was brought in as the now-revolving fourth member of Sugarbakers (rumour has it after Bonnie Hunt turned down the part). As extremely-rich-but-down-to-earth widow B.J. Poteet, Ivey is a terrific addition to the seasoned cast, creating a colorful, charismatic character with a fleshed-out backstory but the addition of B.J. unfortunately throws the show off-kilter and it's now unbalanced like a table with only three legs. It's sad to see a series that has carefully developed it's characters for six years suddenly toss all their history aside to get some cheap laughs. With new writers and Norma Safford Vela now producing, that's exactly the problem with this final season. The show becomes a frustrating mass of contradictions that alienated all except the most devoted fans. The new Friday night timeslot no doubt cost ""Designing Women"" a large chunk of their audience too (the show plunged from #6 to #67 in the Nielsen's resulting in CBS cancelling it in Spring 1993).We open the season with Sugarbakers in dire financial straits because Allison (Julia Duffy) pulled her money out in the middle of a recession. A chance meeting has B.J. Poteet (Judith Ivey) winning the business from Julia (Dixie Carter) in a card game which sets up the premise for this third (and final) incarnation of the show. With B.J. now aboard as the direct and sensible one, Julia has devolved from the dignified, authoritative and savvy leader to an insufferably superior, petulant shrew, though the writers at least try and attribute the change in behavior to menopause. Carter is obviously relishing the chance for the character to show some wild abandon, but the change leaves long-time viewers bewildered. Mary Jo (Annie Potts) also gets more cartoonish and over-the-top, but ironically Carlene (Jan Hooks) gets toned down somewhat. Delivery and timing of all the ladies is still razor-sharp and Ivey's transition into the group is flawless; it's the scripts that let them down.Anthony's engagement to Vanessa Chamberlain (Jackee Harry) is now history--too bad because she could have perfectly filled the void left by Burke/Duffy--so Sheryl Lee Ralph joins the cast during a November Sweeps two-parter in Las Vegas that has Anthony marrying her character (showgirl Etienne Toussant) in a drunken quickie ceremony we the audience never see. The addition of Ralph is another nail in the coffin because she's a very poor substitute for the show's ""diva"" slot. Etienne's personality changes from sharp-cookie to airhead depending on the needs of the script and she seems a better fit for any show on the WB network--not one of CBS's most prestigious comedies.So to sum it up--yes, Season 7 is a mess, but it is not without a few good points. Alice Ghostley is on board for more than half the episodes and our ""little fruitcake"" Bernice is as flaky as ever. Next, the hair, makeup and wardrobe this season is absolutely gorgeous. With B.J.'s millions, it makes sense for Ivey to be dressed to the nines in designer chic every episode, but I guess the producers didn't want the others to look cheap in comparison, so even student/part time receptionist Carlene is decked out in expensive business suits. Carter looks younger here than she did in Season One and Potts' flaming mane was never as ORANGE as you'll see it here (she cut it all off when filming was over to begin her new stint on CBS' ""Love and War"" which had taken over DW's former Monday-night berth).This is a most uneven season because while it has its share of clunkers, a few are actually some of my favorites of the entire series. ""The Woman Who Came to Sugarbakers"" features a great turn from bombastic guest star Pat Carroll as Julia's schoolmistress and some of Bernice's most hilarious lines ever. ""The Lying Game"" has Carlene turning the tables on her crossdressing boyfriend; ""Love Letters"" is a showcase for Ivey's years of theatre training; ""Sex, Lies and Bad Hair Days"" expertly draws on the show's basic premise of ""get four women together and listen to them talk"".Like Seasons 5-6, the comedy is at the forefront but the quality of humour this final go-round has degenerated into that of cheap boob jokes. Those who loved the more thoughtful, sedate ambiance of Seasons 1 and 2 will likely be repulsed by this; fans of more crass comedies like ""Will and Grace"" or even ""Hot In Cleveland"" will enjoy it more.And so Season 7 leaves fans in a quandary--we have a fabulous welcome addition with fun-lovin'-good-'ole-Texas-gal B.J. but her arrival throws the whole balance off and the show is left spinning its' wheels. It certainly deserved the same proper closure that ""The Golden Girls"" finale brought to their show. Script quality aside, it's fantastic to finally see one of my all-time favorites complete on DVD. Once again, the cover art is a little off to diehard fans as Carter's image is actually from a Season Five photo session but it's no biggie, just sayin'!

1537142,AZUTJARDBNT5L,B007RMQ4CW,"R. G. Lee ""rleehistory""","[2, 5]","I didn't watch the last season of Designing Women when it first aired. I was preparing for comps and TV wasn't high on my list of priorities. I also remember that it got poor reviews. But watching it now on DVD I'm not at all sure why it has such a bad reputation. The writing and acting are head and shoulders above anything available on a sitcom now. Judith Ivey and Sheryl Lee Ralph are delightful. I suspect that if the show had started out with this cast and this tone it might have been highly successful.Because there is a decided shift in tone this season, and audiences might have found that disorienting. The characters have become caricatures, albeit likeable ones. Julia's sermonizing and Mary Jo's rabid feminism are sources of amusement rather than edification. The warm, three dimensional characters of the first few seasons all have much sharper edges now, and at times the comedy seems to tilt in the direction of the surreal.Part of the problem I suspect is that Designing Women represented one of the last gasps of the Norman Lear school of the sitcom as a platform for liberal audience indoctrination, and the dubious charms of that particular school were rapidly wearing thin. The show always offered unintentional evidence of the impasse facing liberals during the Reagan/Bush years. Julia is an aristocratic populist who LOVES the people in the abstract, but can barely conceal her contempt for voters who insist on electing Republicans. She was forever offering homilies that were supposed to represent the last word on the subjects at hand, except that the opposing position was invariably caricatured and those who supported it depicted as fools and bigots. The shift in tone perhaps represented a belated recognition that audiences were tired of comedies that confused sofas with pews. And with hindsight the treatment of Bill Clinton's election as a form of second coming seems more than a little premature. (How do you feel about welfare reform, Julia?)Nevertheless, this last season of Designing Women works for me because it succeeds where a sitcom is supposed to succeed. It makes me laugh. I'm only sad we didn't get a chance to see more of Judith Ivey's delicious and down to earth Texas millionaire. I would love to have seen more of her.

1537146,A65XH6L5BUX0X,B007RMQ4CW,"TheClassicsNut65 ""morgan miller""","[0, 0]","As I said in the headliner, I got Season 7 of Designing Women only to have all seasons of this classic series. As we all know, Season 6 dealt with the exit of Delta Burke and Jean Smart and introduced Julia Duffy and Jan Hooks as their replacements. Many viewers did not relate to Duffy's snobby portrayal of Allison Sugarbaker, but many found Hooks as the dimwitted Carlene Dobber to be hysterical. Season 7 gives us yet another cast change as Julia Duffy was let go from her contract and Judith Ivey steps in as her replacement, the wealthy Texan Bonnie Jean &#34;B.J.&#34; Poteet.The season opener, &#34;Of Human Bondage&#34;, is basically a standard episode. Allison Sugarbaker has bailed on Sugarbaker & Associates and the remaining three women, Julia (Dixie Carter), Mary Jo (Annie Potts), and Carlene (Jan Hooks) realize that their business could go bankrupt. They attend a party held by their newest client, the wealthy widow B.J. Poteet (Judith Ivey in her first episode), where they get drunk and play poker with her. Julia looses Sugarbaker's in a bet with B.J., who decides to give it back. In the end, the four women become close friends and B.J. decides to invest her millions into the business to keep it afloat. In all, this is a fare episode, but considerably weak when compared to the Season 6 premiere.Season 7 overall seems to be unfocused. Stories are all over the place. Anthony and Vanessa (Olivia Brown and Jack&eacute;e) decided to not get marry and Vanessa is never mentioned nor seen on the series again. In the episode &#34;Viva Las Vegas&#34; (Season 7, Episode 6), the women talk Anthony into going on a trip to Las Vegas to cheer him up. While there, he wakes up one morning to find himself married to showgirl Etienne Toussaint (Sheryl Lee Ralph). He considers getting the marriage annulled, but ends up finding he and Etienne love each other.In all honesty, Season 6 was indeed far better than Season 7. As much as Julia Duffy as so-called &#34;hated&#34; by viewers, Season 6 had fresh episodes and I found myself laughing uncontrollably. Season 7 offers only minor chuckles at best. The addition of Judith Ivey was perhaps not a wise decision. I am not personally a huge fan of Ms. Ivey or her character B.J. She seems to me to be a stereotypical caricature of the way Hollywood views people from the South. Season 7 is terribly weak: Julia and Mary Jo become more outlandish in their characteristics, while Carlene becomes somewhat more intelligent this season, especially when she uses her ex-husband only for sex.Many long-running fans see Season 7 as an improvement over Season 6, but I must disagree with the majority. Season 7 is the worst season of Designing Women without a question. The series finale, &#34;Gone with a Whim&#34;, is terribly cliched and badly performed; it is noticeable that the cast was weary with the show and wanted to move on. Do not get me wrong, this season is still far better than anything on TV now, but its a low-point in the Designing Women franchise. Its probably a good thing Season 7 was the last season.Signed: TheClassicsNut65",3,Got it only to complete my collection!,1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,3104,"['said', 'headliner', 'got', 'Season', '7', 'Designing', 'Women', 'only', 'have', 'seasons', 'classic', 'series', 'know', 'Season', '6', 'dealt', 'exit', 'Delta', 'Burke', 'Jean', 'Smart', 'introduced', 'Julia', 'Duffy', 'Jan', 'Hooks', 'replacements', 'Many', 'viewers', 'did', 'not', 'relate', 'Duffy', 'snobby', 'portrayal', 'Allison', 'Sugarbaker', 'many', 'found', 'Hooks', 'dimwitted', 'Carlene', 'Dobber', 'be', 'hysterical', 'Season', '7', 'yet', 'cast', 'change', 'Julia', 'Duffy', 'was', 'let', 'go', 'contract', 'Judith', 'Ivey', 'replacement', 'wealthy', 'Texan', 'Bonnie', 'Jean', '34', 'B.J.', '34', 'Poteet.The', 'season', 'opener', '34', 'Human', 'Bondage', '34', 'basically', 'standard', 'episode', 'Allison', 'Sugarbaker', 'bailed', 'Sugarbaker', 'Associates', 'remaining', 'three', 'women', 'Julia', 'Dixie', 'Carter', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'Annie', 'Potts', 'Carlene', 'Jan', 'Hooks', 'realize', 'business', 'could', 'go', 'bankrupt', 'attend', 'party', 'held', 'newest', 'client', 'wealthy', 'widow', 'B.J', 'Poteet', 'Judith', 'Ivey', 'first', 'episode', 'where', 'get', 'drunk', 'play', 'poker', 'Julia', 'Sugarbaker', 'bet', 'B.J.', 'who', 'give', 'back', 'end', 'four', 'women', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'B.J', 'decides', 'invest', 'millions', 'business', 'keep', 'afloat', 'fare', 'episode', 'considerably', 'weak', 'when', 'compared', 'Season', '6', 'premiere.Season', '7', 'overall', 'be', 'unfocused', 'Stories', 'are', 'place', 'Anthony', 'Vanessa', 'Olivia', 'Brown', 'Jack', 'eacute', 'decided', 'not', 'get', 'marry', 'Vanessa', 'never', 'mentioned', 'seen', 'series', 'again', 'episode', '34', 'Viva', 'Las', 'Vegas', '34', 'Season', '7', 'Episode', '6', 'women', 'talk', 'Anthony', 'going', 'trip', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'cheer', 'up', 'there', 'up', 'one', 'morning', 'find', 'married', 'showgirl', 'Etienne', 'Toussaint', 'Sheryl', 'Lee', 'Ralph', 'getting', 'marriage', 'annulled', 'up', 'finding', 'Etienne', 'love', 'other.In', 'honesty', 'Season', '6', 'was', 'indeed', 'far', 'better', 'Season', '7', 'As', 'much', 'Julia', 'Duffy', 'so-called', '34', 'hated', '34', 'viewers', 'Season', '6', 'had', 'fresh', 'episodes', 'found', 'laughing', 'uncontrollably', 'Season', '7', 'only', 'minor', 'chuckles', 'best', 'addition', 'Judith', 'Ivey', 'was', 'perhaps', 'not', 'wise', 'decision', 'am', 'not', 'personally', 'huge', 'fan', 'Ms.', 'Ivey', 'character', 'B.J', 'be', 'stereotypical', 'caricature', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'views', 'people', 'South', 'Season', '7', 'terribly', 'weak', 'Julia', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'become', 'more', 'outlandish', 'characteristics', 'Carlene', 'somewhat', 'more', 'intelligent', 'season', 'especially', 'when', 'ex-husband', 'only', 'sex.Many', 'long-running', 'fans', 'see', 'Season', '7', 'improvement', 'Season', '6', 'must', 'disagree', 'majority', 'Season', '7', 'worst', 'season', 'Designing', 'Women', 'question', 'series', 'finale', '34', 'Gone', 'Whim', '34', 'terribly', 'cliched', 'badly', 'performed', 'noticeable', 'cast', 'was', 'weary', 'show', 'wanted', 'move', 'Do', 'not', 'get', 'wrong', 'season', 'still', 'far', 'better', 'anything', 'TV', 'now', 'low-point', 'Designing', 'Women', 'franchise', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'Season', '7', 'was', 'last', 'season.Signed', 'TheClassicsNut65']",Designing Women: The Final Season
