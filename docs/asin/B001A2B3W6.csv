1165054,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B001A2B3W6,D. Hartley,"[15, 16]","One of the countless bands that migrated to Seattle during the city's brief and shining heyday as America's D.I.Y Mecca was a quartet hailing from Ohio, who called themselves The Gits (in honor of a Monty Python sketch). Led by talented singer-songwriter Mia Zapata, the band mixed the musical tightness and aggressive melodic punch of L.A.'s X with the art-punk lyricism of San Francisco's Romeo Void. Zapata's powerful, bluesy Janis Joplin-meets-Exene Cervenka vocal delivery and charismatic stage presence made her a formidable front woman, and the band quickly gained a strong local following. They also soon gained the attention of local music producers, and were on the verge of being courted by some of the major labels, when it all came crashing to earth with a resounding thud. In the summer of 1993, Mia Zapata was beaten, raped and killed, her body unceremoniously dumped in a vacant lot. Her murder remained unsolved until an astounding break in the case in 2003 helped bring her killer to justice (thanks to a carefully preserved saliva sample taken from the crime scene and advancements in DNA forensics technology). Her frighteningly random and brutal murder not only had a profoundly disheartening and long-lasting effect on Seattle's incestuous music community, but at the time, symbolically represented the beginning of the end for the city's burgeoning music renaissance; it was sort of the grunge era's Altamont, if you will.In a new documentary simply entitled The Gits (available on DVD) super-fans and first time filmmakers Kerri O'Kane (director) and Jessica Bender (producer) have constructed an engrossing, genuinely moving portrait of the band and Zapata's legacy. When O'Kane and Bender were doing initial research for their project, they starting snapping up all the Gits memorabilia they could get their hands on, acquiring much of it via eBay, and mostly through one particular seller. That person turned out to be the band's drummer, who was beginning to wonder who these two particularly obsessed fans were. This serendipity eventually led to the full cooperation of all the surviving band members, after they were fully assured that O'Kane and Bender weren't a couple of weird stalker fan types. This was a legitimate concern due to the fact that Zapata's killer was then still unknown and presumably still at large. Thus began a six year labor of love for the pair.The first half of the film is devoted to the history of the band, beginning with their formation at Antioch College in Ohio in 1986. By the time they moved to Seattle in 1989, the band had developed a sonic sensibility that was more simpatico with classic punk rock than it was to the trendy ""grunge"" sound of the time (speaking strictly as an ""old school"" rock fan, grunge always sounded like warmed-over Blue Cheer or Sabbath to me, while punk was closer to the spirit of The MC5 and The Ramones). O'Kane does a nice job encapsulating their Seattle years with well-chosen performance clips and archival photos. Interviews with the band, some of their friends and members of Mia's family are supplemented by recollections from professional peers like Joan Jett and members of 7 Year Bitch, an all-female Seattle band who were generously mentored by the Gits (and ironically, signed by a major label long before their more musically accomplished mentors were ""discovered"" themselves). The music business is a harsh mistress, indeed.The second half of the film deals with Zapata's death. Much to their credit, the filmmakers don't exploit the sensationalistic aspects of the crime or dwell on all the gory details of the murder itself. Instead, they take the high road and examine the profound effect her loss had on her family, friends, fans and fellow members of the music community. The sensitive and respectful handling of the latter part of the story ultimately accentuates what lies at the heart of a film that could have been a real downer: an inspiring portrait of a group of close friends truly committed to each other, their music and their fans. With all the soulless pap oozing from the music charts and Stepford Idol marionettes warbling their glorified karaoke at us from our Empty Vee these days, it's enough to give one a glimmer of hope that, somewhere out there in the ether, there will always be someone making Music That Matters (well, I can always dream, can't I?)",5,Punk is a feeling,1229904000,"12 22, 2008",2008,4384,"['One', 'countless', 'migrated', 'Seattle', 'city', 'brief', 'shining', 'heyday', 'America', 'D.I.Y', 'Mecca', 'was', 'quartet', 'hailing', 'Ohio', 'who', 'called', 'Gits', 'honor', 'Monty', 'Python', 'sketch', 'Led', 'talented', 'singer-songwriter', 'Mia', 'Zapata', 'band', 'mixed', 'musical', 'tightness', 'aggressive', 'melodic', 'punch', 'L.A.', 'X', 'art-punk', 'lyricism', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Romeo', 'Void', 'Zapata', 'powerful', 'bluesy', 'Janis', 'Joplin-meets-Exene', 'Cervenka', 'vocal', 'delivery', 'charismatic', 'stage', 'presence', 'made', 'formidable', 'front', 'woman', 'band', 'quickly', 'gained', 'strong', 'local', 'following', 'also', 'soon', 'gained', 'attention', 'local', 'music', 'producers', 'were', 'verge', 'being', 'courted', 'major', 'labels', 'when', 'came', 'crashing', 'earth', 'resounding', 'thud', 'summer', '1993', 'Mia', 'Zapata', 'was', 'beaten', 'raped', 'killed', 'body', 'unceremoniously', 'dumped', 'vacant', 'lot', 'murder', 'remained', 'unsolved', 'astounding', 'break', 'case', '2003', 'helped', 'bring', 'killer', 'justice', 'thanks', 'carefully', 'preserved', 'saliva', 'sample', 'taken', 'crime', 'scene', 'advancements', 'DNA', 'forensics', 'technology', 'frighteningly', 'random', 'brutal', 'murder', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'profoundly', 'disheartening', 'long-lasting', 'effect', 'Seattle', 'incestuous', 'music', 'community', 'time', 'symbolically', 'represented', 'beginning', 'end', 'city', 'burgeoning', 'music', 'renaissance', 'was', 'sort', 'grunge', 'era', 'Altamont', 'will.In', 'new', 'documentary', 'simply', 'entitled', 'Gits', 'available', 'DVD', 'super-fans', 'first', 'time', 'filmmakers', 'Kerri', ""O'Kane"", 'director', 'Jessica', 'Bender', 'producer', 'have', 'constructed', 'engrossing', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'portrait', 'band', 'Zapata', 'legacy', 'When', ""O'Kane"", 'Bender', 'were', 'doing', 'initial', 'research', 'project', 'starting', 'snapping', 'up', 'Gits', 'memorabilia', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'acquiring', 'much', 'eBay', 'mostly', 'one', 'particular', 'seller', 'person', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'band', 'drummer', 'who', 'was', 'beginning', 'wonder', 'who', 'two', 'particularly', 'obsessed', 'fans', 'were', 'serendipity', 'eventually', 'led', 'full', 'cooperation', 'surviving', 'band', 'members', 'were', 'fully', 'assured', ""O'Kane"", 'Bender', 'were', ""n't"", 'couple', 'weird', 'stalker', 'fan', 'types', 'was', 'legitimate', 'concern', 'due', 'fact', 'Zapata', 'killer', 'was', 'then', 'still', 'unknown', 'presumably', 'still', 'large', 'Thus', 'began', 'six', 'year', 'labor', 'love', 'pair.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'devoted', 'history', 'band', 'beginning', 'formation', 'Antioch', 'College', 'Ohio', '1986', 'time', 'moved', 'Seattle', '1989', 'band', 'had', 'developed', 'sonic', 'sensibility', 'was', 'more', 'simpatico', 'classic', 'punk', 'rock', 'was', 'trendy', 'grunge', 'sound', 'time', 'speaking', 'strictly', 'old', 'school', 'rock', 'fan', 'grunge', 'always', 'sounded', 'warmed-over', 'Blue', 'Cheer', 'Sabbath', 'punk', 'was', 'closer', 'spirit', 'MC5', 'Ramones', ""O'Kane"", 'nice', 'job', 'encapsulating', 'Seattle', 'years', 'well-chosen', 'performance', 'clips', 'archival', 'photos', 'Interviews', 'band', 'friends', 'members', 'Mia', 'family', 'are', 'supplemented', 'recollections', 'professional', 'peers', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'members', '7', 'Year', 'Bitch', 'all-female', 'Seattle', 'band', 'who', 'were', 'generously', 'mentored', 'Gits', 'ironically', 'signed', 'major', 'label', 'long', 'more', 'musically', 'accomplished', 'mentors', 'were', 'discovered', 'music', 'business', 'harsh', 'mistress', 'indeed.The', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'deals', 'Zapata', 'death', 'Much', 'credit', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'exploit', 'sensationalistic', 'aspects', 'crime', 'dwell', 'gory', 'details', 'murder', 'Instead', 'take', 'high', 'road', 'examine', 'profound', 'effect', 'loss', 'had', 'family', 'friends', 'fans', 'fellow', 'members', 'music', 'community', 'sensitive', 'respectful', 'handling', 'latter', 'part', 'story', 'ultimately', 'what', 'heart', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'downer', 'inspiring', 'portrait', 'group', 'close', 'friends', 'truly', 'committed', 'other', 'music', 'fans', 'soulless', 'pap', 'oozing', 'music', 'charts', 'Stepford', 'Idol', 'warbling', 'glorified', 'karaoke', 'Empty', 'Vee', 'days', 'enough', 'give', 'one', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'somewhere', 'there', 'ether', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'someone', 'making', 'Music', 'Matters', 'well', 'can', 'always', 'dream', 'ca', ""n't""]",N/A

I first heard about them through the punk fanzine Flipside which led me to buy their album Frenching the Bully. Mia totally blew me away with her in your face vocals. When she was murdered in 1993, I was totally devastated as was the tight knit music scene in Seattle. Thanks to two diehard Gits fans, Mia's brief life can be seen in the wonderful documentary The Gits. The first half of the film focused on Mia's life as a loving tribute to a life that was cut short all too soon. It was evident that Mia was much loved by her family and friends. The second half of the film focused on Mia's murder. The filmmaker Kerri O'Kane did a great job of not sensationalizing her murder but instead had Mia's family and friends describe how the loss of Mia affected them. It was done very tastefully. There were quite a few moments when I had to reach for the kleenex box. I was particularly moved by what Mia's father had to say. His grief broke my heart. I was also touched by the scene when Joan Jett had to pause for a moment because she was getting choked up with emotion. For fans of The Gits, this film is a must see. It is a wonderful tribute to Mia.",5,A celebration of Mia's life,1269820800,"03 29, 2010",2010,1263,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Gits', 'was', 'freshman', 'college', 'maybe', 'was', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'first', 'heard', 'punk', 'fanzine', 'Flipside', 'led', 'buy', 'album', 'Frenching', 'Bully', 'Mia', 'totally', 'blew', 'away', 'face', 'vocals', 'When', 'was', 'murdered', '1993', 'was', 'totally', 'devastated', 'was', 'tight', 'knit', 'music', 'scene', 'Seattle', 'Thanks', 'two', 'diehard', 'Gits', 'fans', 'Mia', 'brief', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'wonderful', 'documentary', 'Gits', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'focused', 'Mia', 'life', 'loving', 'tribute', 'life', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'too', 'soon', 'was', 'evident', 'Mia', 'was', 'much', 'loved', 'family', 'friends', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'focused', 'Mia', 'murder', 'filmmaker', 'Kerri', ""O'Kane"", 'did', 'great', 'job', 'not', 'sensationalizing', 'murder', 'instead', 'had', 'Mia', 'family', 'friends', 'describe', 'how', 'loss', 'Mia', 'affected', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'tastefully', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'moments', 'when', 'had', 'reach', 'kleenex', 'box', 'was', 'particularly', 'moved', 'what', 'Mia', 'father', 'had', 'say', 'grief', 'broke', 'heart', 'was', 'also', 'touched', 'scene', 'when', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'had', 'pause', 'moment', 'was', 'getting', 'choked', 'up', 'emotion', 'fans', 'Gits', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'wonderful', 'tribute', 'Mia']",N/A

1165057,A1K6K23WG0IBWE,B001A2B3W6,Quadro Sinead Summer,"[1, 1]","This documentary literally astounded me. It begins pulling no punches that the lead vocalist of The Gits Mia Zapata was murdered. You hear this at the very begining through the voice of one of her band mates. From there on the film explores the humble beginings and musical journey of The Gits as they moved from the east coast on to Seattle to try and further their career and develop into a serious band worth taking notice of. They lived in an old house and rehearsed their music, taking in along the way a group of girls under their wing who didn't play instruments at the time, but who would eventually become the band known as Seven year B i t c h. As The Gits began to get better and better Gigs, they finally got the chance to be part of a documentary and take a tour of Europe. Things were looking very promising. One day they were visited by an executive of Atlantic records who had offered to sign them to its label. Things couldn't have been better. But before the band could have a chance to sign on the dotted line, their lead singer Mia Zapata was beatin, raped, then murdered. Things came to a crashing end and the death of Zapata threw the entire Seattle music scene in turmoil. Her death stunned fellow bands and friends who then joined together along with artists like Joan Jett and Soundgarden to try and raise money to hire a private detective to find Mia's killer. The second half of this film is heartbreaking yet beautifully touching as her family, friends and fellow Seattle musicians try and cope with the terrible tragedy of her loss while trying to find her killer. This was a truly emotional and moving film.",5,Mia Zapata!
