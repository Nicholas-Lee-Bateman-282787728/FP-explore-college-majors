I was fully taken in by his descriptive language about both internal and external landscapes.  So, quite natrually, we found the movie on Amazon. I think I would recommend reading it before watching the movie.  There are several anchor points in the movie in which the thread of the story is clarified and turns  entirely on a phrase uttered by a protagonist and which is taken wholely from Zane Grey's writing.

Childress,"[4, 8]","Generally formulaic:  Threatened, bewildered homesteader lady goes mooney-eyed over brooding, mysterious,coincidentally well-armed saddletramp who beats back the bad guys from her door.  Beautiful scenery and believable period settings, but I found the story lacked continuity, and didn't explain itself very well, so you may miss some of the next scene while still trying to rationalise the previous one.  I gave this movie three stars for its atmosphere and sincerity, in spite of Ed Harris's continuing discomfort under a cowboy hat (Appaloosa).  Wedging Harris in a Zane Grey story is like casting Tom Selleck in a Louis L'amour western ... it's safe entertainment, nice to look at,  and a good box office bet, but it ain't no Lonesome Dove.  I wish we could please dispense with the repetitive John Wayne-ish requirement for handy gullible citizenry to play off of.

In scene after scene, the rugged, soaring cliffs - all rich reds and browns, rough-hewn cathedrals reaching for the heavens - and the sand and bushes valley floors are composed like paintings.The hard-riding scenes are made equally vivid by the cinematographer and the director. More than in any other movie I've seen, the viewer feels close-up to the straining animals and their urging riders.So just the way the movie looks is sufficient reason to buy the DVD. It is a feast for the eyes. However, there is much more to this movie.It also has a first-rate script and performances to savour by the two leads. Ed Harris and Amy Madigan become their characters and with artistic skill convey so much more than just the words. Some scenes where not a word is spoken between them crackle with communication. The script gives all the main actors lines that are laconic, authentic, laden with meaning.This is a complex film whose images and dialogue convey a sense of strangeness and mysticism that will stay with the viewer.This is one of the very best Westerns.
