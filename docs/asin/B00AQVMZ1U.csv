1615168,A1WOP3FW37QKXG,B00AQVMZ1U,3in1,"[22, 35]","There is no doubt that Jullian Fellowes can spin a yarn, but fear has clouded his artistry.  I think the hardest reality to face is that the writer did not trust his fans; and that is such a shame.  After loosing Dan Stevens (Matthew Crawley), fans were dismayed and hurt; but that was not Follows fault.  He did his best to secure the actor but in the end, Mathew Crawley must be killed off.Now, this adds a great deal of writing possibilities for season 4, as all the fans go through the grieving process along with the characters of the show.  So, what shouldn't happen?  Exactly what did happen...another shock!  While rising from the loss of two beloved characters, we have to suffer more.  Why add another shock?  Well, to get our minds off of Mathew's death, of course.  This was a mistake, for sure; and one that could have been avoided if Julian Fellowes had been more trusting.  In turn, I believe he has lost the trust of many fans.Then too,  I think the development of characters is lacking, as they seem to be caught up in a whirlpool type of development which leaves the audience feeling a deja vu experience.  All of which adds up to Downton heading in the direction of, and allow me to coin a phrase from season one, ""the slippery slope.""I'll not desert the sinking ship, yet.  Perhaps it may still float.

Burchfield,"[2, 3]","This round started out with O'Brien's abrupt, middle of the night departure (although I guess a hint of the possibility was given in the season 3 &#34;special&#34;). As of tonight I've watched PBS through part 6 and the rest on DVD- it all looks good. Some have complained about the writing or some of the story bits- you do get some surprises  but most viewers will think the Downton standard isn't slipping.Thomas Barrow is his old self again, Daisy & Ivy upset over Alfred, Bates turns out to be a most interesting character as a result of his time in prison (he's able to help Lord Grantham save the monarchy from embarrassment)- he and Anna have a violent storyline that may still be around next season. Mary still grieves over her loss of Matthew but ends up with 3 new suitors while Edith, poor girl, is still unlucky in love ( I'll be interested in seeing how that works out- that one will be difficult). Rose&#8230;is Rose, She never really tames down.I loved the new locations and vehicles used, even a street scene outside Buckingham Palace (very impressive effort though I'm sure it wasn't used for interior shots which still looked good).My biggest irritations are actually very minor- Lady Cora told Mrs. Patmore they were getting a new electric refrigerator (this was soon after the new electric mixer) - never saw /heard mention of it again. I'd have liked to have seen little Sybil and baby George more too-  they didn't get 10 minutes screen time between them the whole season!You do get the season 4 finale, &#34;The London Season&#34;, with this set so don't go buying it separately.3 very good extras are included; &#34;Downton Diaries&#34;, &#34;The Making of&#34; and &#34;Meet the new cast&#34; (some of them)- all worthwhile.

It's so hard for a TV series to remain fresh year after year.  It's even harder when it's a series that is constrained by a certain time period.  If you think about it, the Abbey is somewhat of a prison, as most of the action takes place there.  They are also limited by what happened in history, rather than creating what is or what could be now.However, I was delighted to find that the series was still interesting and yes, fun.  And some of what I'm going to say may contain spoilers if you haven't watched the third season, and then I am going to discuss some of the plot from this season, so...SPOILER ALERT!Dame Maggie Smith was in her element and stole the show in every scene in which she participated.  She's just so GOOD in this role.  I admire actors who can take on a character who would be so easily hated and make them lovable (such as Alan Rickman with Snape in the Harry Potter movies.)  I loved how kind she was to Lady Edith and to Isobel.I also enjoyed Penelope Wilton's Isobel, as she beautifully took us through the grieving of her son.  And the interactions between Maggie Smith and her were quite wonderful.Michelle Dockery continues to amaze me with her restrained performance of Lady Mary.  Every trouble in the world is laid at her feet, and then people wonder why she can be hard as nails?  Can't imagine why!  She also did a great job in conveying her grief over the loss of Matthew.Finally, Joanne Froggat did a beautiful job in such a difficult performance.  The emotions she portrayed, the way they showed in her face, even the way she held herself...she's truly talented.If I had some complaints, it would be these (SPOILER ALERT):1.  Can there be no happiness for long for Mr. and Mrs. Bates?  First he's in jail, now she's raped.  I'm not saying it's not realistic - life can be very hard - but can they have SOME joy?2.  I'm dying to know Baxter's background.  I can't believe it was not revealed at all.3.  I couldn't remember what Daisy and Ivy were fighting about and honestly, it was just way too much for too long.4.  The whole Prince of Wales letter debacle was just, well, stupid.

In the first two episodes of season 4 it seems the writers have lost their muse and are producing a labored and rather boring story line, so they have to resort to the sordid rape of a favorite character in episode 3.  Add that to the deaths of two of Downton's  characters in Season 3, it's just too much and the joy is gone.  I think Downton's secret in the early seasons was to have just enough pathos to keep the plot interesting without becoming an American-style soap drenched with sleeze, creeps, blood and violence.

But what I can't stand about it, even though I perversely keep watching--apparently as an act of self-torture--is the writing. Why can't the writers for once really explore a character rather than write everyone as a caricature? If the characters were allowed to be real human beings, the contrived feeling of the storylines would disappear. The breaking down of class barriers in early 20th century Britain really is a fascinating subject: Why box it in with the 21st century's culture of idiocy and bad manners? What's really maddening is the pacing. It's as though the writers agreed: Every scene will be X minutes long and will be patched together in any ol' way with no continuity of emotion whatsoever between them. There is too much ""Meanwhile upstairs at the Abbey ...,"" ""Meanwhile downstairs at the Abbey ...,"" ""Meanwhile back at the Dowager's house ..."" or ""Meanwhile back at Isabell's house ..."" I had high hopes they had hit rock bottom with Dan Stevens leaving the show at the end of season 3 and so HAD to improve but, no, they just keep it up ... to wit:Edith and Michael: First off: Why? There's no chemistry between them. Edith is probably interested in being rescued from the Life of an Old Maid Aunt of the Manor. Michael's becoming a German citizen will certainly make life complicated when Hitler invades Poland but that's 17 years away. I want at least a hint of what his real motives are NOW. Is Edith still writing her column? As another reviewer suggests it would be fabulous if she were to move to London and immerse herself with the Lost Generation literati of the day.Anna and Bates: After episodes 3 and 4, I am soooo confused. Anna spent a good deal of season 3 devoting herself to Bates' defense on a murder charge because she was sure Bates is incapable of murder. But now she is convinced she cannot tell Bates what Gillingham's valet did to her because she's certain Bates would kill him.Mary and Lord Gillingham: When Lord Gillingham proposes in ep. 4, he tells her ""You take as long as you need: two years, three ..."" The next day he tells her he's gotta marry somebody, his fiance is waiting, so he'll be off now. Again, I am sooo confused.Tom Branson: Based on the shirtless scene from last season and his increasing moodiness, I take it he's supposed to be the brooding, heart-throb stud of this show. If that is the case, Allen Leech has been miscast.Barrow: Yes, his being a gay man forced to live in the closet is so frustrating he must occasionally take it out on his co-workers. I think I understood this from season 1. Can we move on?Cora Crawley aka Countess of Grantham: C'mon Julian Fellowes: Admit it. You write her as a little nave, a little impetuous because she's ... an AMERICAN.Daisy: Can anyone really be so dumb she doesn't realize how self-centered she is? I would expect a character as young as she is to develop, mature, become more self-aware. Being the first one in the scullery to use an electric mixer doesn't count.Rose: Rebellious teenage girl 1920s-style. Instead of an iPod with headphones she plays the gramophone in her bedroom as loud as she can. OMG, so annoying!Mrs. Patmore: The show's only relate-able character. But why is she a ""Mrs""?

For myself, I don't know either but I am enamored with it.  Season 4 introduces new characters and they are completely in sync with the existing cast.  It always amazes me that there are so many characters and so many stories held within each episode.  Season 4 does not disappoint.  We find ourselves in the thrust of the economic times and how the ""House"" is going to continue its survival.  Mary's spirit leads the House into times that ""stirs the pot."" I was hoping for a larger role for Tom this year but with so many characters, Tom's character continues to be stand-up-able. Edith, who previously has shown less characterization, has actually had more substance than previously and I believe that her story line will be extremely interesting for next season.  I really loved Season 4 but it seemed that it had difficulty in picking up the pace as well as creating the enthralling dimensionality that we have all enjoyed through the first 3 seasons.  Truth is that one of season 4's greatest accomplishments have been the continued growth of each cast member.  I really like the aspect of age.  We get to see Sibby and George through the generations to Grandmama.  The introduction of Americans in the script is so much fun and I so enjoy the quipping between the English and the Americans.  Also the bickering and challenges between Violet Crawley and Isobel Crawley is fun and really makes the quality and honesty of the family work some how.  I have been told that others just don't like TV about rich people.  I always chuckle because it simply isn't about the rich, it is simply about life in the 1920s.  Some of the most heart felt story lines are based on the staff.  I feel that the staff and the Crawleys are an inter-changeable family. Season 4 is Excellent and Fun to watch on Amazon Prime. It was interesting this season because I was able to seen the entire Season 4 in January.  Where on regular TV, it won't be completed until sometime in February.

1615277,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B00AQVMZ1U,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[651, 712]","With a global audience of over 125 million, Downton Abbey Season 4 is probably the most anticipated show this year.  This number of followers is set to increase as Chinese State TV has, apparently, just started to broadcast it, although what the average Chinese television viewer will make of the antics of the Crawleys I shudder to think!  This time round we pick up six months on from the tragic end to the Series 3 Christmas Special.Downton has moved with the times, and, as usual, great care has been taken to make the setting, including all the small details, correct for the period.  Hence clothes and hair styles have changed and advances in technology, such as the telephone and even new fangled electric kitchen gadgets are evident.  The cast has all the significant characters who survived the last series, so Maggie Smith continues as the matriarch who dominates every scene she is in, and Shirley MacLaine makes a welcome reappearance after her all too brief involvement in the previous series.  Seeing her sparring with Maggie Smith must be one of the more memorable aspects of this show.  There are some new faces to look out for, one of whom is Kiri Te Kanawa, the New Zealand opera singer as well as a couple of other well known characters in cameo roles.More of the scenes this time round have been filmed on location in London.  Meanwhile at Downton itself, the antics and interaction of those `below stairs' continues to contribute some very interesting story lines and their trials and tribulations are, in many ways, one of the most interesting aspects of the show.  Above stairs initially Lady Mary is, understandably, rather subdued whilst Lady Edith really seems to be coming into her own having, perhaps, been somewhat overshadowed previously.  The producers have publicly promised no more deaths, at least for a while, but I will not be giving away any key parts of the plot here as I certainly do not want to spoil anyone's enjoyment!Downton Abbey has certainly continued to go from strength to strength and has confounded those critics who thought it would peter out after a couple of series.  If you enjoyed the previous seasons then Season 4 is unlikely to disappoint, and there is every sign that the show is set to continue.  I do not believe any announcement has been made about Season 5 yet but apparently some of the key figures have already signed contracts for it.  However, personally I would not be surprised to see it run up to the 1930s in due course.  I certainly hope so!For those of you interested in additional features this set includes 'The Making', The Downton Diaries and New Arrivals.Edit in January 2014 - Just to clarify following a number of comments on the review.  This review was written when Season 4 was released in the UK three months ago.  The set issued in the UK did not include the Christmas Special episode which is the finale as it was not aired until December 25th.  However, this North American issued set being released on Jan 28th certainly does include the Christmas Special (even though it is subtitled UK Edition!) ie this set as sold here does include the Christmas Special.

Oh well life goes on.  I just watched season 4 and while entertaining it felt like it was missing something.  First the bad.  The reset button was hit for Thomas.  The end of series 3 was somewhat redemptive for him but by the end of episode 1 of season 4 he is the villain again.  Mary mourns for a couple of episodes but immediately has two (three?) suitors, none of whom is very interesting.  Tom Branson still mourns Sybil, and gets 2 relationships but again neither is interesting.  Lady Rose decides to have a relationship with a black band leader which could of been interesting but is such a underdeveloped part of the script it is unconvincing and felt tacked on.  I hated the Anna assault storyline.  If I wanted depravity I would turn into Law & Order Special Victims unit.What did I like?  Laura Carmichael as the ever suffering Lady Edith.  Her storyline was a little melodramatic and a little predictable but I found it was at least engaging.  Maggie Smith was wonderful as always as was Penelope Wilton as Isobel Crawley.  Kevin Doyle and Raquel Cassidy as Molseley and Baxter gave me underdogs to root for.  Even though I though Lady Rose's story was poorly executed, Lily James has good screen charisma.

It is with some trepidation I even write a review below five stars.  But it is because seasons 1 and 2 set the bar high.  Season 3, while generally very good, did not quite seem to reach the heights of 1 or 2.  With the 'ahem' occurrence at the end of season 3, the show has changed drastically.  Without spoilers, I would say that many of the characters have changed, and though many portray things realistically, I felt that the 'new' characters are not quite as interesting as they once were.A few events tend to grate on my nerves.  Most notably was the Earl taking part in a plot to re-steal a scandalous letter from a blackmailer.  Granted, he didn't want shame on his house, but the old Earl would not have taken part in something so dishonest, no matter the stakes.  Especially when he sends members of his family to con the hotel into letting them into the blackmailer's room!  Completely out of character and unrealistic.  The fallout of that scandal would have been worse than the original had they been caught!That is just one example.  But overall the show is still good.  I do dislike that the writers take a few story arcs and beat them to death.  It's much more drawn out than even the whole Bates murder trial event.Again - still good!  I just hope the melodrama gets toned down in future seasons.  And I know that Penelope Wilton and Maggie Smith were busy filming, but I also hope we get more of them in the next season than we did in this season.

1615345,A1M3EE8V0K42ZH,B00AQVMZ1U,Christopher Schindler,"[4, 9]","The sets are great.  Some of the acting is good.  The depiction of many aristocrats is believable in that they exhibit their naive ignorance of &#34;real life&#34;.  Is this supposed to be a sociological look at the difference of classes, acceptance of people in an era when there was little acceptance of outsiders?  Is it supposed to be a fairy tale world of people getting along across the barriers of the crippling conventions of the British Empire?  Is it supposed to imply that the favored rich of that world have big hearts and are just ordinary folk who can accept the chauffeur with no demur?  To show how the Americans appeared to underwrite many of the great houses of Britain but were generally still looked down upon for their differences?  Anthony Trollope may have been able to do justice to this group of people, but I think the story as it is goes nowhere.With all real soap operas too many characters get into the stew as they are introduced to keep the story going,  and then there isn't time to develop anything very deeply.  Too many cameo parts, and no cohesive story.  The last episode was the worst of all, leaving everything up in the air with no resolutions.  Julian Fellowes just seems unable to let go of all this panorama of people moving around, dancing, being presented at court and almost always punctuated by that MUSIC.  Who wrote that theme song?We are subjected to that putrid music constantly as well as all these unlikely relationships.

To me, the first hour was just tedious with a now very unsympathetic Mary, who actually seems more disgruntled than grieving.  Her self-absorption carries a bitter bite and less interest than usual in anyone but herself, including her child.  However, the second hour picked up, along with Mary's spirits.Overall though, that unmistakable vital edge we have become accustomed to with DA was sorely lacking, rendering the whole rather flat, acting included.  The scenes in the downstairs area particularly palled for the first time, especially some in the kitchen.  Same great people, but the fire is missing. Even Maggie Smith's parts were lackluster.  There's a point where the best actors cannot overcome trite dialog and boring recycles of old themes.I had understood formerly that Julian Fellowes is involved in at least one other large project, and perhaps that explains what seems a lack of due diligence to this one.  Even with that, he seems to be diminishing his main characters in stature and depth while escalating devious and underhanded elements. His current presentation appears to be going in the way of his ""Gosford Park,"" where everyone was foibled - and worse.Whatever it is, overall and in several key areas like the writing, directing and now some of the acting, unless this one picks up with continuing episodes, it is destined to end in a fizzle, a shadow of its former self.Regardless, I will cherish my first two seasons DVDs as they will always carry the vibrant pulse and excellence that set Downton Abbey apart.",3,Review of Opening Night's Program - US Viewing,1388966400,"01 6, 2014",2014,1738,"['who', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'swoon', 'over', 'something', 'habit', 'think', 'most', 'actual', 'viewers', 'will', 'acknowledge', 'regret', 'something', 'definitely', 'opening', 'episode', 's', 'DA', 'Season', '4', 'first', 'hour', 'was', 'just', 'tedious', 'now', 'very', 'unsympathetic', 'Mary', 'who', 'actually', 'more', 'disgruntled', 'grieving', 'self-absorption', 'bitter', 'bite', 'less', 'interest', 'usual', 'anyone', 'including', 'child', 'However', 'second', 'hour', 'picked', 'up', 'Mary', 'spirits.Overall', 'unmistakable', 'vital', 'edge', 'have', 'become', 'accustomed', 'DA', 'was', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'rendering', 'whole', 'rather', 'flat', 'acting', 'included', 'scenes', 'downstairs', 'area', 'particularly', 'palled', 'first', 'time', 'especially', 'kitchen', 'Same', 'great', 'people', 'fire', 'missing', 'Even', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'parts', 'were', 'lackluster', 'point', 'where', 'best', 'actors', 'can', 'not', 'overcome', 'trite', 'dialog', 'boring', 'recycles', 'old', 'themes.I', 'had', 'understood', 'formerly', 'Julian', 'Fellowes', 'involved', 'least', 'one', 'other', 'large', 'project', 'perhaps', 'what', 'lack', 'due', 'diligence', 'one', 'Even', 'be', 'diminishing', 'main', 'characters', 'stature', 'depth', 'escalating', 'devious', 'underhanded', 'elements', 'current', 'presentation', 'be', 'going', 'way', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'where', 'everyone', 'was', 'foibled', 'worse.Whatever', 'overall', 'several', 'key', 'areas', 'writing', 'directing', 'now', 'acting', 'one', 'up', 'continuing', 'episodes', 'destined', 'end', 'fizzle', 'shadow', 'former', 'self.Regardless', 'will', 'cherish', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'DVDs', 'will', 'always', 'carry', 'vibrant', 'pulse', 'excellence', 'set', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'apart']",N/A

Each one of the suitors has their own merits.I was very disappointed in the casting of Cora's brother when they went with Paul Giamatti. I have seen him portray a villain very well but he was a poor choice for the role of someone who is supposed to be a well known playboy. The character was also poorly written because he had no social graces at all. They could have made a much better choice for this role in terms of writing and casting.I enjoyed the little storyline for Daisy and the possibility of romance for Mr Carson.Episode 9 has me anxious to see the new developments for the upcoming season 5.

1615494,ARSSDYEN6DE6B,B00AQVMZ1U,E. R. Brooks,"[20, 27]","The continuation of Julian Fellowes&#8217; masterpiece has been downgraded to tragic mediocrity.  His opening chapters have served as quick explanations for the death of Matthew, the loss of O'Brien, the treachery of Thomas, the blindness of Cora, and the ineptness of Robert.  It has also reached into the private cubbies of the faithful viewers to crush their carefully created perceptions and beliefs about those remaining characters that have so boldly taken up residence in our hearts.  Fellowes has torn us from that intangible fabric that I describe as character continuity.  Without it, the viewer becomes lost in an aimless sea of change.  What made Downton Abbey different was the viewer&#8217;s ability to count on the responses of the remaining characters to reasonable crisis.  The launch of season 4 has destroyed that expectation.  Fellowes failed to fully take us, the fans, into his many considerations as he dealt with the troublesome issues of cast mutiny and other more mundane production issues.  The result is mediocrity, and in my opinion, unrecoverable fan alienation.  That is not to say the show will fail, on the contrary, I think it will succeed, but with a very different viewer base.  Those of us who have made it a viewing hit have been &#34;kicked to the curb&#34;.  I suppose that is the way of things, but I cannot in good conscience let such a flagrant disregard for the feelings of those who &#34;brung you to the dance&#34; go without a protesting word.The launch of season 4 indicates that Fellowes has repositioned the series.  It is no longer in the category of a masterpiece classic, but in the genre of a soap opera styled period tragedy.  It has lost the spark of differentiation that pushed it to masterpiece status and has been relegated to idiotic inconsistencies and unbelievable situations.  Come on Julian&#8230; you can do better than that!Lady Rose MacClare has come to live at Downton Abbey.  She is a wild child with poor judgment.  She is a liar and a seeker of experiences below her station.  She is a 1920's &#34;flapper&#34; who has had an affair with a married man in London and looks for excitement in the most dangerous of places.  There is no reason whatsoever for anyone at Downton to trust her.  She prepared an ad to find a ladies maid for Cora, and placed it in a shop window in town.  She collected the responses and presented them to Cora.  Why?  Cora did not ask her to do this nor did she give Rose permission to solicit on her behalf.  There is no reason for Rose to take it upon herself to place the advertisement.  Cora on the other hand is an American who is self sufficient and used to doing things for herself.  Edna Braithwaite applies along with others, but Rose pushes Cora to accept Edna.  Rose has no prior known relationship with Edna, therefore, no good reason to push for her acceptance by Cora.  During the interview, Cora finds out that Edna once worked at Downton, but left with a good reference from Mrs. Hughes.  Cora is aware of the politics that surrounds the management of subordinates.  She knows that giving a good reference to a terminating employee is not always evidence of good behavior on that job.  However, she does not consult Mrs. Hughes to determine the facts of the termination, but accepts the recommendation of Rose.  This situation doesn't pass the smell test.  In the past, Cora has proven that she is level headed, and capable.  She is not stupid.  Why would she accept an applicant without confirming the circumstances of the termination with her long term employee, Mrs. Hughes? This situation is unbelievable and highly insulting to the American character of Cora.  In other words, American women ain't that stupid!Edna Braithwaite is a character with vindictive and selfish purpose.  Upon learning of Branson's circumstances and his rise to aristocratic station, she has set out to bring him down or join the ranks of aristocracy herself through her manipulated bond with him.  It is unclear, at this juncture, which direction she intends to pursue.  She has shown her willingness to ignore the protocols of her station in the household and snub some minor advice from Anna about Thomas.  She does not show great commitment to the job of Ladies Maid for Cora and demonstrates a propensity to defy the orders of Mrs. Hughes.  Thomas makes overtures to Edna and she accepts his friendship.  When she negligently damages a garment of Cora's, Thomas assists by instructing her not to admit guilt and he puts the blame for the damage onto Anna.  Anna has been a trusted employee for years.  She has never demonstrated behavior that would cause Cora to question her trust. However, in this unbelievable situation, Cora accepts the explanation of Thomas because of his newly acquired status of trust which he gained through &#8220;Nannygate&#8221;, and does not ask Anna for an explanation about the damaged garment.  The American woman whose financial fortune saved Downton Abbey is being portrayed as an easily manipulated idiot.A nanny is employed to care for the two grand children of Cora and Robert; Tom Branson's daughter, and Matthew Crawley's son.  She isolates the children from most of the family and refuses to take orders from Thomas, the &#34;Under Butler&#34;.  Thomas, for the wrong reasons, rightfully informs Cora that the nanny is not all she is cracked up to be.  Cora eavesdrops on her and discovers she is being cruel to her first grandchild, the former chauffer's (Tom Branson&#8217;s) daughter.  Cora immediately dismisses her.  On the surface, this situation appears appropriate.  Thomas appears to be a Good Samaritan.  Beneath the surface, he appears to be vindictively attacking the nanny for failing to recognize his authority as &#34;Under Butler&#34;.A package addressed to Mary arrives.  It contains the personal effects of Matthew.  Mrs. Hughes convinces Carson that the contents should be inspected for items that may cause Mary additional grief.  Carson decides that Robert should be given that dubious honor.  The ethics grow increasingly fowl with this decision.  Do Mrs. Hughes, Carson, and subsequently, Robert think they should withhold, hide, or destroy some item(s) that rightfully belong to a grieving widow in some poorly reasoned desire to mitigate her grief?  Mary has proven over the last three (3) seasons that she has the ability to handle her own affairs.  A letter is found by Robert in Matthew&#8217;s personal effects that clearly outline his wishes regarding the disposition of his estate.  It is clear that this is a holographic will.  Robert shares it with the Dowager who tells him that it must be presented to Mary, its rightful owner.  Mary rightfully shows displeasure with her father for going through her husband's effects and sharing the contents of the letter with her grandmother.  Robert claims the letter is not a will and must be sent to the family attorney to determine its validity and authority.  The family lawyer confirms the status of the holographic will and Mary is recognized as 50% owner of Downton Abbey.  The lack of ethics displayed by Mrs. Hughes, Carson, and Robert are a slap in the face of British aristocratic culture for that era.Rose, the wild child convinces Anna to chaperone her on a visit to London.  They go to a rough and ready bar where a fight breaks out between two men who want her attentions on the dance floor.  When they return to Downton Abbey, one of the two men call on her thinking she is a ladies maid.  Anna assists her in the deception by helping her dress in maid's attire.  Rose greets the young man and lies to him regarding her status.  She tells him she is involved with another man, but passionately kisses the visiting man goodbye.  She tells the first footman, Jimmy Kent, who just happened to be in the rough and ready bar in London at the time of the fight, and helped she and Anna escape, to go along with her lies.  Julian!!  What are you thinking?  Is everyone at Downton corrupt?  What's going on here?Branson begins to feel uneasy with his new status.  He tells Edna Braithwaite and she quickly responds.  This situation was anticipated when Edna was hired by Cora.  The replacement of O'Brien with Edna Braithwaite was not properly developed.  However, this situation can be corrected.Lord Gillingham arrives for a party with his valet, Mr. Green.  The valet waits for an opportunity to be alone with Anna, the only married woman on the staff.  He beats and rapes her.  Anna hides in Mrs. Hughes' quarters.  Mrs. Hughes arrives to find Anna beaten, bloodied, and raped.  Mrs. Hughes wants to call in help.  She wants to call in Dr. Clarkson, but Anna demands that she not reveal to anyone what has happened to her.  She is afraid that her husband, Bates will kill the jackal and go back to prison for murder.  Mrs. Hughes complies.  Is Anna to become pregnant with a rapists child and hide the ancestry of the child from her husband?  Will she have a child and put it up for adoption?  Will she have an abortion?  Will she lose Bates for failing to trust him as a man and husband?  Is Anna the latest of many victims of this rapist?  Will rapist Green return or try to blackmail Anna?  This occurrence tipped the scales for me.  Downton Abbey is no longer a masterpiece classic, it is a soap opera styled period tragedy that does not challenge the viewer in a modestly intellectual way, but shocks and tramples the established character traits of its remaining cast.I am so disappointed in the first three installments of Season 4, that I am giving thought to boycotting the remainder of the season.  I probably won't, but I am giving it some thought.  In the first three seasons, Thomas and O'Brien were the ethically challenged culprits.  In Season 4, just about every main character is an antagonist.  Who can we the viewers trust to have integrity?  Now when I see the beautiful Highclere Castle, it does not bring about feelings of warmth, security, and respectability as it has in times gone by.  It now looks like a house of horrors filled with death, debauchery, rape, and personal ruin.  When I want to endure that kind of tragedy and pathos, I will turn to Shakespeare&#8230; or Mickey Spillane.",3,The Downfall of Downton Abbey,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,10235,"['continuation',

The costumes and acting and script is, of course, still brilliant and one of the best things on tv, IMHO.  Plus, how can you go wrong with the backdrop of Downton with its incredible rooms and the estate.  No matter that, this season, we spend some time in London, the estate and the house remain part and parcel of this show.The stories both upstairs and downstairs still draw us in, as do the characters.  We love them.  We hate them.  There is romance and intrigue and discovery and wonder.  What more can you want in a drama?  In addition, the modern world keeps coming into Downtown--as we've moved from the introduction of the telephone and electrity in earlier seasons to sewing machines, mixers, and even talk of a refrigerator!  Its interesting to see what we take for granted these days as something strange and new and even a bit frightening.Some spoilers below.Very much, Season 4 is about love and loss.  Not just the obvious about Mary mourning the tragic loss of her husband, Matthew, as she lingers in the beginning between life and death.  But we all know her strength, even if she seems to have lost sight of it.  I also enjoyed the scene where the Dowager talked to Mary about making a choice over coming out of her loss, and also how she told off her son, Robert, when he would protect Mary from everything, even herself.  Its also good to see so many men chasing after Mary--she well deserves it!Edith also faces love and loss and having to make a hard decision when it comes to her own love, Michael Gregson, and I've gone from disliking Edith as a character to feeling sorry for her and even admiring her for her own strength.  She's really come into her own in this season.  Her big choice, however, I suspect will come back to haunt her in Season 5 perhaps?Branson is still also in mourning, not just for his wife but for his life.  He seems more unsure in this season, as if the fire had gone out of him.  Yes, he meets a new interest, but I'm still waiting for him to become the firebrand we knew from previous seasons...if only a bit more down to earth.  I really felt his story was one of the low points of the season, as I honestly don't care as much about him as I used to.  The other plot line I don't care for is Rose.  She just seems spoiled and annoying most of the time and we all know her romance with the bandsinger would come to nothing in the end.  I wish they would get Branson back to being himself again and figure out what to do with Rose besides trot her out to dance and play music and flirt all of the time.Downstairs, there is the triangle of unrequited love with Daisy and Ivy and Alfred, which I thought they resolved in a very grown-up fashion.  There is also the question of what does Thomas hold over Cora's new maid?  Not to forget, the darkest plotline in this season--the brutal attack on Anna.  This was very hard to watch and really brought home some of the issues of being a woman in the 1920's.  When her husband finally found out and comforted her, it made me cry.  As for Mr Bates--did he or didn't he?  The Anna-Bates storyline remains one of the best in the show, shrouded as it is in hardship and pain over which the power of their love for each other wins through.The final episode went from the palace to the seaside and, I must admit, watching our dour butler wading is well worth waiting a whole season for...Overall, this is a great season and it remains a great show.

Of course we miss Sybil and Matthew, but since the actors chose to leave, there's nothing to be done about it. I believe that the writers did a great job considering that they had to rewrite characters' lives. I do like the addition of what Violet calls &#34;Mary's men.&#34; Sure, it's a little distasteful that she has three men hanging from the fishing line, but instead of thinking of it that way, enjoy them. The actors do a wonderful job, they're all so handsome, and their characters really do add a nice element to the story (even though we still miss Matthew). My main complaint is what they're doing with Tom Branson (Sybil's husband). Sure, he still misses his wife, and he's lonely, but do they really have to pair up such a great guy with those horrid women. Please, please say that Miss Bunting won't return because I can't stand her character. Rose's childish antics can't compare with Sybil's free spirit, but I'm glad they made her a bit different rather than trying to &#34;create&#34; another personality like Sybil's. She brings a little spunk to the show. Mary is the &#34;cold fish,&#34; but she's still one of my favorites, and has some great one-liners.

It is still occupied by an Earl & his wife.  There is a butler, two chefs, a total staff of about twenty.  It is still surviving, but the annual costs run over a million pounds a year, and the Downton Abbey filming is a big help in that regard.  I found that show on another provider's menu - Netflocks, or something like that.

Season 4 demonstrates that there can indeed be life ""after Matthew"" for the noble Earl and Countess of Grantham, their daughters, son-in-law, grandchildren, mother, and ever loyal staff.It's the 1920s, and life is really getting back to ""normal"" again at Downton Abbey after the upsets of World War I.  Lord Grantham continues to deal with the changing face of the world, assisted now by the surprisingly able Lady Mary, his eldest daughter who is now the mother of his heir.  His son-in-law Tom Branson and his younger daughter Lady Edith continue to search for roles of their own.  There's a new young lady in the house now, Lady Rose, a cousin of the Granthams who is making her London debut (her presentation at Buckingham Palace is marvelous).  Meanwhile, below stairs the servants loyally keep the house moving smoothly most of the time, barring the occasional catastrophe here and there.I enjoyed Season 4, though in truth I must say that I find Downton wearing a little ragged around the edges.  The original concept was so quintessentially Edwardian that it doesn't seem to quite fit into the Jazz Age, though Julian Fellowes and his writing team continue to do a masterful job.

1615667,ABUGC6184LYR9,B00AQVMZ1U,Joseph Ryan,"[1, 2]","The angle of this particular knock-off of Pride and Prejudice is that the Bennet sisters take on the social status and manners of the Bingleys.  The character who most resembles the Liza we remember is Matthew, in a thoroughly modern gender reversal.  Don't fear for Mr. Darcy's character, however; successors abound.Alternatively, Downton Abbey may of course be viewed as an Upstairs, Downstairs knock-off, with Matthew and Lady Mary acting out the back-story of Richard Bellamy and Lady Marjorie.  In place of Jean Marsh's relatively spare, grown-up world of London and a professionally active head of household, Downton Abbey adopts as its principal character the consumer values of the house itself, with its decor, furnishings, table settings, and grounds (and of course the costumes and hair styles).  Perhaps it's a case of ""Upstairs, Downstairs Meets The Age of Innocence.""  The production values are obviously very high.In any case, what's really new is that the action of Downton Abbey comprises about 13 -- or is it 30? -- sub-plots running simultaneously.  The cutting is fast and furious, as if it needs to get each scene in before the next tweet hits the audience's smart phone.One aspect that has been a little surprising to me is that, for a work with an atmosphere that is predominantly humane, the bodies do pile up, don't they?  I don't think they're trying to be Shakespearian; it's just that no one has tenure any more -- everyone's an adjunct.Downton's realization that Ireland exists ensures its fourth star.",4,"Jane Austen Meets Upstairs, Downstairs and Contracts ADD",1392595200,"02 17, 2014",2014,1531,"['angle', 'particular', 'knock-off', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Bennet', 'sisters', 'take', 'social', 'status', 'manners', 'Bingleys', 'character', 'who', 'most', 'resembles', 'Liza', 'remember', 'Matthew', 'thoroughly', 'modern', 'gender', 'reversal', 'Do', ""n't"", 'fear', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'character', 'however', 'successors', 'abound.Alternatively', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'may', 'course', 'be', 'viewed', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'knock-off', 'Matthew', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'acting', 'out', 'back-story', 'Richard', 'Bellamy', 'Lady', 'Marjorie', 'place', 'Jean', 'Marsh', 'relatively', 'spare', 'grown-up', 'world', 'London', 'professionally', 'active', 'head', 'household', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'principal', 'character', 'consumer', 'values', 'house', 'decor', 'furnishings', 'table', 'settings', 'grounds', 'course', 'costumes', 'hair', 'styles', 'Perhaps', 'case', 'Upstairs', 'Downstairs', 'Age', 'Innocence', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'obviously', 'very', 'high.In', 'case', 'what', 'really', 'new', 'action', 'Downton', 'Abbey', '13', '30', 'sub-plots', 'running', 'simultaneously', 'cutting', 'fast', 'furious', 'get', 'scene', 'next', 'tweet', 'audience', 'smart', 'phone.One', 'aspect', 'been', 'little', 'surprising', 'work', 'atmosphere', 'predominantly', 'humane', 'bodies', 'do', 'pile', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'re"", 'trying', 'be', 'Shakespearian', 'just', 'one', 'tenure', 'more', 'everyone', 'adjunct.Downton', 'realization', 'Ireland', 'fourth', 'star']",N/A

This story is so important to me as a member of the Spencer family and relation to the current Earl of Spencer (also sharing the same full name as my father) at the family estate in Althrop.Yet after the fabulous season 3, and cliff hanger, season 4 was such a let down. Instead of revealing plot for those who have not seen season 4.. All I will say is that this season the plot will center around two key events. One surrounding Anna Bates (chamber maid) married to John Bates (butler/valet)... which after the sadness, drama of previous seasons of following these two characters.. was the plot twist really realistic or necessary?  The other concerns lady EdithHowever some of the great characters are just not even developed in season 4. BOO!  Personally I was shocked that the incredible acting of Rob James Collier as Thomas Barrows was not showcased after season 3. Meaning after the incident between Thomas and Jimmy, and Thomas profound lonliness and determination to up in class ranks, that they did not develop a plot around him. Was this because O'brien left the show?  Which was also awful. She was essential to the plot.  So sad.The other characters of Daisy, Mrs. Pattmore etc. are hardly developed this season.  And the love interest of Jack Ross for Lady Rose is sort of funny and odd choice for plot... not to mention his vocal styling is completely wrong for the period. AKA mediocre.Also Kiri Te Kanawa as Nellie Melba? REALLY? pleassssssse.

1615684,ADH4TDQ6I4UF8,B00AQVMZ1U,Julie Browning,"[4, 5]","The series is still wonderful, and I will continue to watch it (for a while longer, at least), but with Matthew and O'Brien gone it just doesn't have the same appeal to me.  Anna getting raped was very disturbing, and I'm not sure it was a good move when there are other directions the show could have gone in to create a dramatic situation. I understand rape is unfortunately  a fact of life, but I was not happy it was included in Downton Abbey, especially in that day and age when help for a rape victim was mediocre, at best. Also, I found myself rolling my eyes in disbelief when Carson's old buddy shows up again and moves in with Isobel because Mrs. Hughes takes it upon herself to befriend him and orchestrate his salvation. Really? Cora's one-dimensional character is beginning to grate on my nerves. For example, when Branson's seducer, the former house maid Edna returns, gullible Cora hires her on the spot as her lady's maid, based upon the fact she had been employed by Downton previously for about three days before she was bounced by Mrs.Hughes. Edna has little if any experience as a lady's maid and was the only applicant, but 18 year old Rose likes her and encourages Cora to give her a try. Now there's a reliable source when considering who to hire as your closest personal employee! However, Mrs. Hughes, Carson, and Branson agree they simply can't tell poor Cora about Edna's inappropriate behavior toward Branson when she worked in the house before, because Mrs. Hughes did write her a good reference when she left (at Branson's request). They fear if they told gentle Cora the truth about Edna, Her Ladyship might come down with the ""vapors"" and need a smelling salt, or something! Please!  Robert, although I do like him basically, can be too much of a snobby prig for words...has he totally forgotten he would have lost Downton because of his really bad investment if Matthew hadn't come to the rescue?  Now at times he doesn't have the insight, humility, or willingness to listen to others who have excellent suggestions on how to profitably run the estate.  Mary and the Dowager Countess are the only interesting and multifaceted characters left, in large part because of their superb acting and excellent writers. I also think Isobel adds a lot to the show with her terrific acting skills and interactions with the Dowager Countess.  I also love Daisy, and hope they build some story lines around her other than her mooning over Alfred. Thomas is always terrific fun to watch, as his mischievous ploys downstairs and upstairs are usually wickedly delicious. If Mary and her British grandmother go the show is doomed. I love Shirley MacLaine, but her stiff portrayal of Cora's mother is dull and adds nothing. In my opinion, continuing with the deeper progression into Edith's struggles, relationships, and activities is the way to proceed with this character. I enjoy watching this great actress work, and more of her would be most welcome. Some of the most captivating episodes to come will hopefully revolve around who Mary becomes romantically involved with...that's worth continuing to tune in for at least a while longer. I realize this series takes place in a different place, time, and social class than 21st century America, and overall I feel it is a wonderfully researched, written, and acted series that I have enjoyed tremendously.  In conclusion, I believe the quality and direction of the first four episodes I've watched of Season Four do not rise to the level of the first three seasons.  However, I suppose I'm still mourning the loss of Matthew, Lady Sybil, and the complex O'Brien. I truly hope Season Four will ""settle in,"" and the compass of excellence will be regained.",4,"NOT AS GOOD AS PREVIOUS SEASONS, BUT HOPING IT WILL GET BETTER",1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,3721,"['series', 'still', 'wonderful', 'will', 'continue', 'watch', 'while', 'longer', 'least', 'Matthew', ""O'Brien"", 'gone', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'appeal', 'Anna', 'getting', 'raped', 'was', 'very', 'disturbing', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'good', 'move', 'when', 'are', 'other', 'directions', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'create', 'dramatic', 'situation', 'understand', 'rape', 'unfortunately', 'fact', 'life', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'was', 'included', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'especially', 'day', 'age', 'when', 'help', 'rape', 'victim', 'was', 'mediocre', 'best', 'Also', 'found', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'disbelief', 'when', 'Carson', 'old', 'buddy', 'up', 'again', 'moves', 'Isobel', 'Mrs.', 'Hughes', 'befriend', 'orchestrate', 'salvation', 'Really', 'Cora', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'beginning', 'grate', 'nerves', 'example', 'when', 'Branson', 'seducer', 'former', 'house', 'maid', 'Edna', 'returns', 'gullible', 'Cora', 'spot', 'lady', 'maid', 'based', 'fact', 'had', 'been', 'employed', 'Downton', 'previously', 'about', 'three', 'days', 'was', 'bounced', 'Mrs.Hughes', 'Edna', 'little', 'experience', 'lady', 'maid', 'was', 'only', 'applicant', '18', 'year', 'old', 'Rose', 'Cora', 'give', 'try', 'Now', 'reliable', 'source', 'when', 'considering', 'who', 'hire', 'closest', 'personal', 'employee', 'However', 'Mrs.', 'Hughes', 'Carson', 'Branson', 'agree', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'poor', 'Cora', 'Edna', 'inappropriate', 'behavior', 'Branson', 'when', 'worked', 'house', 'Mrs.', 'Hughes', 'did', 'write', 'good', 'reference', 'when', 'left', 'Branson', 'request', 'fear', 'told', 'gentle', 'Cora', 'truth', 'Edna', 'Her', 'Ladyship', 'might', 'come', 'down', 'vapors', 'need', 'smelling', 'salt', 'something', 'Please', 'Robert', 'do', 'basically', 'can', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'snobby', 'prig', 'words', 'totally', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'Downton', 'really', 'bad', 'investment', 'Matthew', 'had', ""n't"", 'come', 'rescue', 'Now', 'times', ""n't"", 'have', 'insight', 'humility', 'willingness', 'listen', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'excellent', 'suggestions', 'how', 'profitably', 'run', 'estate', 'Mary', 'Dowager', 'Countess', 'are', 'only', 'interesting', 'multifaceted', 'characters', 'left', 'large', 'part', 'superb', 'acting', 'excellent', 'writers', 'also', 'think', 'Isobel', 'lot', 'show', 'terrific', 'acting', 'skills', 'interactions', 'Dowager', 'Countess', 'also', 'love', 'Daisy', 'hope', 'build', 'story', 'lines', 'other', 'mooning', 'Alfred', 'Thomas', 'always', 'terrific', 'fun', 'watch', 'mischievous', 'ploys', 'downstairs', 'upstairs', 'are', 'usually', 'wickedly', 'delicious', 'Mary', 'British', 'grandmother', 'go', 'show', 'doomed', 'love', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'stiff', 'portrayal', 'Cora', 'mother', 'dull', 'nothing', 'opinion', 'continuing', 'deeper', 'progression', 'Edith', 'struggles', 'relationships', 'activities', 'way', 'proceed', 'character', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'great', 'actress', 'work', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'welcome', 'most', 'captivating', 'episodes', 'come', 'will', 'hopefully', 'revolve', 'who', 'Mary', 'romantically', 'involved', 'worth', 'continuing', 'tune', 'least', 'while', 'longer', 'realize', 'series', 'place', 'different', 'place', 'time', 'social', 'class', '21st', 'century', 'America', 'overall', 'feel', 'wonderfully', 'researched', 'written', 'acted', 'series', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'tremendously', 'conclusion', 'believe', 'quality', 'direction', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Season', 'Four', 'do', 'not', 'rise', 'level', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'However', 'suppose', ""'m"", 'still', 'mourning', 'loss', 'Matthew', 'Lady', 'Sybil', 'complex', ""O'Brien"", 'truly', 'hope', 'Season', 'Four', 'will', 'settle', 'compass', 'excellence', 'will', 'be', 'regained']",N/A
1615685,A10872FHIJAKKD,B00AQVMZ1U,Just Bill,"[558, 708]","My wife and I loved Downton Abbey from the first episode. To an extent, we still think very highly of it.But we watched the first two episodes of Season 4 last night and, when they ended, heaved a big ""meh.""There are a number of problems with Season 4 of Downton Abbey:CAUTION: MIGHT BE SPOILERS AHEAD!1. Thomas is still there, and still a colossal pain in the ass. Despite being one of the most despicable people at Downton Abbey, nearly universally disliked by every other character, Thomas is still employed at D.A.2. Now that Miss O'Brien is gone (she left in the middle of the night without telling anyone), Cora Crawley needs a new Lady's Maid. Enter Edna, who more or less tricks her way back into D.A. by answering an ad to be Miss O'Brien's replacement. The character was without scruples when we last saw her; she's not improved now, and quickly forms an alliance with Thomas.3. So, once again, Thomas is paired with a woman - this time Edna - to wreck havoc on the other servants at D.A.4. The problem with that is two-fold: (a) the person they chose to stab in the back is Anna. Anna! The sweetest, most compassionate and kind member of the staff; and (b) the Earl and Countess of Grantham actually believe Thomas and Edna when they speak ill of Anna. Cora Crawley, apparently not the sharpest crayon in the box, always took the side of Miss O'Brien, too. But now she's taking the side of a brand new Lady's Maid against Anna! How can that be? Can Cora and Robert Crawley really be that bad a judge of character? When Robert confronted Bates to tell him to keep Anna in check, my wife and I looked at each other and shook our heads. Would Robert have done that? Does he not know what kind of people Bates and Anna are?5. The fact that we now have nearly the same configuration of characters we did in Season 1, with the nearly the same conflict, tells me that Julian Fellowes is out of ideas. Now he's just recycling what came before, only setting it in a new year (1922, if I recall the super on the screen correctly). Characters who do not change, who remain the same, are really bad, two-dimensional characters. Cora Crawley hasn't changed. She's still a dimwit. Thomas hasn't changed. He's still a manipulating scuzz ball. Bates and Anna are still the moral center of Downton Abbey. But now that Thomas and Edna are set on attacking them, I'm afraid we're ready to stop watching.We enjoyed Season 1-3 and watched them religiously. A few of them made us cry. We really got into the characters and the stories.But something feels really off about Season 4. Or maybe something feels precisely on. Everyone is exactly the same. And if all Julian is going to do is recycle the same conflicts (usually with Thomas and his female cohort), then we've got better things to do with our time.",3,"Plots Getting Tired, Characters Becoming Caricatures",1388966400,"01 6, 2014",2014,2797,"['wife', 'loved', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'first', 'episode', 'extent', 'still', 'think', 'very', 'highly', 'it.But', 'watched', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'Season', '4', 'last', 'night', 'when', 'ended', 'heaved', 'big', 'meh', 'are', 'number', 'problems', 'Season', '4', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'CAUTION', 'MIGHT', 'BE', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', '1', 'Thomas', 'still', 'there', 'still', 'colossal', 'pain', 'ass', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'despicable', 'people', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'nearly', 'universally', 'disliked', 'other', 'character', 'Thomas', 'still', 'employed', 'D.A.2', 'Now', 'Miss', ""O'Brien"", 'gone', 'left', 'middle', 'night', 'telling', 'anyone', 'Cora', 'Crawley', 'new', 'Lady', 'Maid', 'Enter', 'Edna', 'who', 'more', 'less', 'tricks', 'way', 'back', 'D.A', 'answering', 'ad', 'be', 'Miss', ""O'Brien"", 'replacement', 'character', 'was', 'scruples', 'when', 'last', 'saw', 'not', 'improved', 'now', 'quickly', 'forms', 'alliance', 'Thomas.3', 'So', 'once', 'again', 'Thomas', 'paired', 'woman', 'time', 'Edna', 'wreck', 'havoc', 'other', 'servants', 'D.A.4', 'problem', 'two-fold', 'person', 'chose', 'stab', 'back', 'Anna', 'Anna', 'sweetest', 'most', 'compassionate', 'kind', 'member', 'staff', 'b', 'Earl', 'Countess', 'Grantham', 'actually', 'believe', 'Thomas', 'Edna', 'when', 'speak', 'ill', 'Anna', 'Cora', 'Crawley', 'apparently', 'not', 'sharpest', 'crayon', 'box', 'always', 'took', 'side', 'Miss', ""O'Brien"", 'too', 'now', 'taking', 'side', 'brand', 'new', 'Lady', 'Maid', 'Anna', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'Can', 'Cora', 'Robert', 'Crawley', 'really', 'be', 'bad', 'judge', 'character', 'When', 'Robert', 'confronted', 'Bates', 'tell', 'keep', 'Anna', 'check', 'wife', 'looked', 'other', 'shook', 'heads', 'Would', 'Robert', 'have', 'done', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'people', 'Bates', 'Anna', 'are', '5', 'fact', 'now', 'have', 'nearly', 'same', 'configuration', 'characters', 'did', 'Season', '1', 'nearly', 'same', 'conflict', 'Julian', 'Fellowes', 'ideas', 'Now', 'just', 'recycling', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'only', 'setting', 'new', 'year', '1922', 'recall', 'super', 'screen', 'correctly', 'Characters', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'change', 'who', 'remain', 'same', 'are', 'really', 'bad', 'two-dimensional', 'characters', 'Cora', 'Crawley', ""n't"", 'changed', 'still', 'dimwit', 'Thomas', ""n't"", 'changed', 'still', 'manipulating', 'scuzz', 'ball', 'Bates', 'Anna', 'are', 'still', 'moral', 'center', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'now', 'Thomas', 'Edna', 'are', 'set', 'attacking', ""'m"", 'afraid', ""'re"", 'ready', 'stop', 'watching.We', 'enjoyed', 'Season', '1-3', 'watched', 'religiously', 'few', 'made', 'cry', 'really', 'got', 'characters', 'stories.But', 'something', 'feels', 'really', 'Season', '4', 'maybe', 'something', 'feels', 'precisely', 'Everyone', 'exactly', 'same', 'Julian', 'going', 'do', 'recycle', 'same', 'conflicts', 'usually', 'Thomas', 'female', 'cohort', 'then', ""'ve"", 'got', 'better', 'things', 'do', 'time']",N/A

Great gravy, this was a good season.  Granny is better than ever.  We are watching her age and move closer to the end, and this actress remains the creme de la creme of the show.  Her patience with so many people beneath her social class clamoring to give her attention and a turn around the ballroom is amazing. Mary's class consciousness makes me want to send her to the House of Lords, but oh not in her day.  It is hard to believe that Robert and Cora would overlook the moody illegitimate pregnancy of one of their daughters.  They all hang out together too often to not miss her for four months and note that she couldn't care less about Swiss French.  Perhaps George will one day stumble over his half sister tending a pig pen, and look out for sparks and revelations.  The Irish Catholic chauffeur turned estate agent and adopted son in law does need to leave the house to make sense.  His love for the Crawleys seems to either be a calculated way to keep a higher status or a sad, insecure rejection of his own class values to keep his daughter in good favor with her mother's people.  Either way he needs to go to America or marry the school teacher and live in the village.  I am tired of the gay guy being the bad guy, and it would be nice if he met a railroad employee and ran off to find love, but no chance?  Cora is nice, but her people are awful. I am an American and I hate the intrusion of her relatives into this period piece fantasy.  It does highlight the tragedy of the aristocracy at the mercy of market capitalism and populist politics in the 20thc.  Ah well, banking, finance, diplomacy and maybe non-profit management are open to employ them.  Which man will win Lady Mary's hand in the next season?  Will Granny leave the show by God's hand? Will the little bastard be discovered and taken into the big house (unlikely, but they did take in the Irish Sinn Fein chauffeur)?",5,"Hot season, full of new stories and surprises",1405382400,"07 15, 2014",2014,2024,"['Tragedy', 'intrigue', 'romance', 'scandal', 'old', 'lord', 'clearly', 'stating', 'monarchist', 'defending', 'social', 'class', 'Great', 'gravy', 'was', 'good', 'season', 'Granny', 'better', 'ever', 'are', 'watching', 'age', 'move', 'closer', 'end', 'actress', 'creme', 'la', 'creme', 'show', 'patience', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'social', 'class', 'clamoring', 'give', 'attention', 'turn', 'around', 'ballroom', 'amazing', 'Mary', 'class', 'consciousness', 'want', 'send', 'House', 'Lords', 'oh', 'not', 'day', 'hard', 'believe', 'Robert', 'Cora', 'would', 'overlook', 'moody', 'illegitimate', 'pregnancy', 'one', 'daughters', 'hang', 'out', 'together', 'too', 'often', 'not', 'miss', 'four', 'months', 'note', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'Swiss', 'French', 'Perhaps', 'George', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'stumble', 'half', 'sister', 'tending', 'pig', 'pen', 'look', 'out', 'sparks', 'revelations', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'chauffeur', 'turned', 'estate', 'agent', 'adopted', 'son', 'law', 'need', 'leave', 'house', 'make', 'sense', 'love', 'Crawleys', 'either', 'be', 'calculated', 'way', 'keep', 'higher', 'status', 'sad', 'insecure', 'rejection', 'own', 'class', 'values', 'keep', 'daughter', 'good', 'favor', 'mother', 'people', 'way', 'go', 'America', 'marry', 'school', 'teacher', 'live', 'village', 'am', 'tired', 'gay', 'guy', 'being', 'bad', 'guy', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'met', 'railroad', 'employee', 'ran', 'off', 'find', 'love', 'chance', 'Cora', 'nice', 'people', 'are', 'awful', 'am', 'American', 'hate', 'intrusion', 'relatives', 'period', 'piece', 'fantasy', 'highlight', 'tragedy', 'aristocracy', 'mercy', 'market', 'capitalism', 'populist', 'politics', '20thc', 'Ah', 'well', 'banking', 'finance', 'diplomacy', 'maybe', 'non-profit', 'management', 'are', 'open', 'employ', 'Which', 'man', 'will', 'win', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'hand', 'next', 'season', 'Will', 'Granny', 'leave', 'show', 'God', 'hand', 'Will', 'little', 'bastard', 'be', 'discovered', 'taken', 'big', 'house', 'unlikely', 'did', 'take', 'Irish', 'Sinn', 'Fein', 'chauffeur']",N/A

1615722,AFOHUSVNZZ49W,B00AQVMZ1U,K. Reynolds,"[1, 3]","NO ONE KNEW what to expect in Season 4 of &#8220;Downton Abbey&#8221; &#8211; only that the show would go on even though actor Dan Stevens, who played Matthew Crawley, husband to Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), refused to renew his contract in hopes of pursuing other projects.&#8220;Downton Abbey&#8221; executives, cast and fans took the news hard. The relationship between Matthew and Lady Mary had been the heart of the internationally popular show. In the &#8220;Meet the New Cast,&#8221; Hugh Bonnevill, who plays Robert, Earl of Grantham, says, &#8220;It did feel strange coming back here &#8230; to film the first scene a few weeks ago and realizing there was a gap. But, I&#8217;m sorry guys, no actors are indispensable, and the show and the house and the estate is bigger than any of us.&#8221;Executive producer Gareth Neame agrees. Losing a main character is difficult, but now there&#8217;s a new story about a woman trying to rebuild her life.That&#8217;s the heart of Season 4, watching Mary and the rest of the family and servants get on with their lives. It begins just as we would expect; Mary&#8217;s father, Robert, wants to shelter his daughter &#8211; and Mary is in the mood to be coddled. Former chauffeur, now brother-in-law Tom Branson (Allen Leech) encourages Mary to take part in running the estate. It&#8217;s the Dowager Violet (Maggie Smith), Mary&#8217;s grandmother, who tells her, she alone can choose her fate.While Mary decides between a life of mourning or activity &#8211; and Branson continues to worry about his place in the world and how it might affect his daughter &#8211; Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) gets a chance to shine. Previously plain and unlucky in love, Edith sparkles in a gorgeous new wardrobe and her ongoing relationship with journalist/publisher Michael Gregson (Charles Edwards), who gives Robert a helping hand when least expected. Still, as Edwards explains in the &#8220;New Cast&#8221; feature, Gregson has something of a dark past and Edith&#8217;s problems may not be over yet.As &#8220;Downton&#8221; enters the Roaring &#8216;20s &#8211; with a defiant Lady Rose (Lily James) determined to keep her family screaming &#8211; we are introduced to talented black jazz singer Jack Ross played by Gary Carr. It&#8217;s easy to see where Rose wants to go with this (What doesn't work is the family&#8217;s reaction to the relationship; frankly, it&#8217;s not in keeping with the period.) Among other newcomers are two potential suitors for Mary, Lord Gillingham (Tom Cullen) and Charles Blake (Julian Ovender), both engaging and likable. &#8220;I would like to see Mary be bossed around and see someone able to handle her,&#8221; Dockery says.Love is a motivating factor for those downstairs, too &#8211; except for Barrow (Rob James-Collier), who continues to scheme and plot just because he can. He brings in a new ally, Baxter (Raquel Cassidy), but is she willing to play along? Footman Alfred (Matt Milne), who longs to be a cook, continues his role as the unwitting focus of Daisy (Sophie McShera) and Ivy's (Cara Theobold) affections, much to the frustration of Mrs. Patmore (Lesley Nicol) and Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan) &#8211; and the confusion of butler Carson (Jim Carter). We also delve further into Bates&#8217; (Brendan Coyle) unique skills.As a fan, there is nothing like watching &#8220;Downton Abbey&#8221; on Blu-ray. The picture is so much more intense, colorful and detailed than in broadcast, even on an HD-TV. Few films &#8211; especially TV series &#8211; show off their visual riches as well as &#8220;Downton&#8221; with its lavish costuming and scenic locations. (Yes, as standard, the season finale takes us to a lavish party with all the eye-candy.) The 2.0 DTS-MA sound mix remains standard, since the show is largely made up of dialogue, which comes through beautifully. Background music usually emphasizes dramatic moments &#8211; by now, we all know the cues &#8211; but the jazz moments are clearly defined. As always, these are the unedited British shows, available on both the Blu-ray and DVD.There are 3 discs in the Blu-ray and DVD sets, and 9 episodes. HD bonus features are brief, each about 10 minutes long. They include &#8220;Downton Diaries,&#8221; a video diary of a day on-set led by Sophie McShera, and a making-of feature exploring Season 4, with an emphasis on costumes. The best is &#8220;Meet the New Cast,&#8221; that introduces the new actors and their characters, and provides a look at how Season 4 came together.Creator/writer Julian Fellowes gives viewers time to acknowledge Matthew&#8217;s loss, then masterfully leads us into the new plot threads and characters. It leaves me hoping that Fellowes will take us much further into the Downton story than the projected Season 5 finale.  &#8212; Kay Reynolds",5,Showbiz tradition takes &#8216;Downton Abbey: Season

I love the comfort of a more genteel era, despite the occasional modern frustration of watching characters who won't communicate about delicate issues. I watch a lot of historical fiction precisely because it's generally free of the grit and gore that populate modern works.Season Four opened on a bit of a low note. I was saddened by O'Brien's and Matthew's absence, as they both were strong characters on opposite ends of the spectrum. I wasn't pleased to see Braithwaite, because her relationship with Tom seems destined for repetition, and it wasn't very interesting the first time around. His Lordship seems to be retreating into fuddy-duddyhood with all his assumptions, pronouncements, and unilateral decisions that rub wrongly on the other characters.And then, the infamous Episode Three aired.Just. No. Omg, no.The level of violence at the end seemed entirely out of character for the show. The character who performed it seemed to have walked in from a 1970's thriller. His actions seemed illogical and careless, as if he were accustomed to getting away with such violence. Even if the times did support such a conspiracy of secrecy despite facial injuries on various women servants everywhere he went, modern audiences have managed to evolve somewhat. The end result is that the attack scene feels horribly offensive, out of alignment with the show's seasons-long tone, and sewn on from another genre about as subtly as Frankenstein's limbs, All in order to garner controversy, ratings, views, discussion, and other things that drive SEO and publicity.I'm not watching the rest of the season. I'm seriously annoyed at Mr. Fellowes and his outrageous hubris. If you'd stuck to what you're clearly good at, this season would be more entertaining, but apparently ruining a beloved show is your Get Out of Jail Free card, so you can dash off to America to shoot your next project (as mentioned in a Montreal Gazette interview) without having to listen to us poor besotted fans begging you to come back and make more.

That's why Cora only vaguely remembered her, which is believable.-- Someone mentioned they don't know where the Edith's baby storyline came from.  It came from the episode where she spent the night with Michael just before he left for Germany.  There, he was set upon by some of Hitler's ""brown shirts"" and even his newspaper isn't sure what's happened to him.  We watched Edith grow stronger as she makes company decisions for Michael (using her power-of-attorney privileges) and she does all of this while working through a way to hide her pregnancy (Aunt Rosamund to the rescue).  Good to have a show go the adoption route rather than abortion.  Nice touch.-- I DO hope Rose isn't a big factor in Season 5.  O'Brien, Thomas, and Rose are the ""Barney Fife"" characters in this series, for me.  They become tedious to watch and you wish they'd just go away (which, thankfully, O'Brien did).  Newsflash to Julien, BBC, PBS, etc.:  the younger crowd was watching Downton before you added an obnoxious teenager.  If you keep Rose, could you please make her grow up q-u-i-c-k-l-y and keep the sweet parts of her character?  Othewise, she tiring.-- To a totally different ... and tragic ... topic, they would have lost me if they hadn't come to a fulfilling conclusion after the rape.  An American production would have dragged that on a couple of years.  Dragging in on for a couple of episodes was bad enough.  Once John knew what was going on, we all could relax a bit (instead of the constant ""Tell him!"" tension.)-- EXCELLENT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IN SEASON 4.Joseph Molesley (we discover his first name) becomes much stronger, and Cora's new lady's maid - Miss Baxter - finally tells off Thomas.  I hope they continue the Molesley/Baxter storyline, because they deserve each other in a nice way :->.  Edith is heading to Germany, which has me a little nervous.  ""Levinson"" is often from a German/Jewish background.  Not sure if that's going to play a part in Edith's safety, going into a bad situation. Do any historians out there know when the Nazis began looking to the nth degree on ancestry for an excuse to kill people?  If Edith stays, she may be in danger.-- Excited for Alfred as he finally makes it to underchef at the Ritz.  His dream-come-true is on its way.  Will he send for Daisy after all (as he once did for Ivy), or will she take up her former father-in-law's offer to take a place at his farm (her inheritance)?  The Daisy/Ivy loggerhead was nicely solved with Ivy heading to America with the Levinsons.  Hoping we'll see more of the Harold/Madeleine relationship.  Julian  left it open.-- Good Mrs. Patmore/Daisy moments throughout the season, which were nice to see.  We discover Carson's long-lost-love.  Julian has given us an impossible choice when it comes to Mary's suitors.  All three are good candidates, but I'm rooting for Tony :->.  I'm hoping his honesty about Charles - when it was to Tony's detriment - gives him some extra points - ha!",4,"""Downton"" Sure Packed a LOT into Season 4 !",1405814400,"07 20, 2014",2014,3563,"['Note', 'extras', 'DVD', 'were', 'good', 'behind-the-scenes', 'items', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'liked', 'after-show', 'presentations', 'had', 'PBS', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'only', 'reason', 'rated', '4', 'instead', '5.', 'WHEW', 'lot', 'happened', 'Season', '4', 'did', ""n't"", 'SPOILERS', 'address', 'others', 'comments', 'Regarding', 'Edna', 'why', 'clueless', 'Cora', 'hired', 'first', 'obnoxious', 'Rose', 'stepped', 'AGAIN', 'where', 'was', 'not', 'invited', 'remember', 'Season', '3', 'Edna', 'was', 'clean-up-committee', 'was', 'rarely', 'room', 'family', 'was', 'Downtown', 'very', 'brief', 'time', 'why', 'Cora', 'only', 'vaguely', 'remembered', 'believable.', 'Someone', 'mentioned', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'Edith', 'baby', 'storyline', 'came', 'came', 'episode', 'where', 'spent', 'night', 'Michael', 'just', 'left', 'Germany', 'was', 'set', 'upon', 'Hitler', 'brown', 'shirts', 'even', 'newspaper', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'happened', 'watched', 'Edith', 'grow', 'stronger', 'company', 'decisions', 'Michael', 'using', 'power-of-attorney', 'privileges', 'while', 'working', 'way', 'hide', 'pregnancy', 'Aunt', 'Rosamund', 'rescue', 'Good', 'have', 'show', 'go', 'adoption', 'route', 'rather', 'abortion', 'Nice', 'touch.', 'DO', 'hope', 'Rose', ""n't"", 'big', 'factor', 'Season', '5', ""O'Brien"", 'Thomas', 'Rose', 'are', 'Barney', 'Fife', 'characters', 'series', 'become', 'tedious', 'watch', 'wish', ""'d"", 'just', 'go', 'away', 'thankfully', ""O'Brien"", 'did', 'Newsflash', 'Julien', 'BBC', 'PBS', 'etc', 'younger', 'crowd', 'was', 'watching', 'Downton', 'added', 'obnoxious', 'teenager', 'keep', 'Rose', 'could', 'please', 'make', 'grow', 'q-u-i-c-k-l-y', 'keep', 'sweet', 'parts', 'character', 'Othewise', 'totally', 'different', 'tragic', 'topic', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'had', ""n't"", 'come', 'fulfilling', 'conclusion', 'rape', 'American', 'production', 'would', 'have', 'dragged', 'couple', 'years', 'Dragging', 'couple', 'episodes', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'Once', 'John', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'could', 'relax', 'bit', 'instead', 'constant', 'Tell', 'tension', 'EXCELLENT', 'CHARACTER', 'DEVELOPMENT', 'IN', 'SEASON', '4.Joseph', 'Molesley', 'discover', 'first', 'name', 'much', 'stronger', 'Cora', 'new', 'lady', 'maid', 'Miss', 'Baxter', 'finally', 'off', 'Thomas', 'hope', 'continue', 'Molesley/Baxter', 'storyline', 'deserve', 'other', 'nice', 'way', '>', 'Edith', 'heading', 'Germany', 'little', 'nervous', 'Levinson', 'often', 'German/Jewish', 'background', 'Not', 'sure', 'going', 'play', 'part', 'Edith', 'safety', 'going', 'bad', 'situation', 'Do', 'historians', 'out', 'there', 'know', 'when', 'Nazis', 'began', 'looking', 'nth', 'degree', 'ancestry', 'excuse', 'kill', 'people', 'Edith', 'stays', 'may', 'be', 'danger.', 'Excited', 'Alfred', 'finally', 'underchef', 'Ritz', 'dream-come-true', 'way', 'Will', 'send', 'Daisy', 'once', 'did', 'Ivy', 'will', 'take', 'up', 'former', 'father-in-law', 'offer', 'take', 'place', 'farm', 'inheritance', 'Daisy/Ivy', 'loggerhead', 'was', 'nicely', 'solved', 'Ivy', 'heading', 'America', 'Levinsons', 'Hoping', ""'ll"", 'see', 'more', 'Harold/Madeleine', 'relationship', 'Julian', 'left', 'open.', 'Good', 'Mrs.', 'Patmore/Daisy', 'moments', 'season', 'were', 'nice', 'see', 'discover', 'Carson', 'long-lost-love', 'Julian', 'given', 'impossible', 'choice', 'when', 'Mary', 'suitors', 'three', 'are', 'good', 'candidates', ""'m"", 'rooting', 'Tony', '>', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'honesty', 'Charles', 'when', 'was', 'Tony', 'detriment', 'extra', 'points', 'ha']",N/A

For example, we were saddened by the attack on Anna, the one truly unselfish and giving character in the story. Her husband Bates' grief when he finally learned the truth, as well as his loving way of handling the situation when he talked with her is an example of the quality writing and acting in this series.  We hope to see Anna emerge with the knowledge that her true identity as a good, incorruptible, and decent woman could never really be defiled, despite the social misconceptions of the time. We hope the writers have Bates lets go of his desire for retribution, and that the perpetrator is made to stand trial.

(Ho-hum!)Oh and later on even those new-fangled electrical appliances manage to steal every scene they appear in. You know you're in trouble when the gadgets become the stars!It's not until late in episode THREE that anything REALLY happens this time round. (And it's the ONLY significant event in the whole Season too!)Before that it's just long lingering shots of Lady Rigor-Mortis (Mary) mooning and moping about in a semi-comatose state, dressed in her widow's weeds, and walking as though she has a broom handle secreted somewhere within her girdle.She's just SO stiff and cold, and only livens up a little towards the last episodes, .....but it takes a tumble into some pig s*** to achieve this. Even that is so prettily handled that it manages to make the s*** look more like the finest Belgian chocolate. Which I'm betting it was for the shoot!The storyline, ...(if you could call it that), tends to centre on Her Ladyship for this series but her mono-tonal delivery, white white skin, wraith-like appearance and inexpressive acting style are more suited to a haunting.....or a Mrs Danvers role perhaps?The other characters are not given much to work with here.Ladies Maid O'Brian is never seen. Just an anonymous pair of legs and a suitcase doing an early morning flit from Downton at the very beginning of Episode One. We are only told that it was indeed O'Brian that was leaving sometime later on.Bates is reduced to constantly creeping about and lurking in the semi-darkness of the lower corridors looking like some resurrection of Dracula. He doesn't seem to have many duties upstairs as he spends all his time looming from the shadows to accost people and looking positively sinister! His scenes with his wife are actually quite creepy really. He is devoid of any warmth now.Wife Anna manages some very difficult scenes well, ....but the situation she's in then gets stuck into some sort of hiatus and doesn't really develop until the very end five episodes later.Long time devotees of this series will no doubt be pleased to hear that Elizabeth McGovern has maintained her acting style of tilting the head forward and peering myopically through her lashes.It's comforting, because D.A. just wouldn't be the same without that.The script seems to have forgotten that second daughter Edith was developing as a writer when we left Series Three, and having her articles published in a spirit of independence. It's not mentioned at all here.Nor is her once fierce rivalry with Mary.Dead Matthew's Mother Isobel Crawley mutates as we watch from her deep and quite touching mourning into something of a blend between Pollyanna, Florence Nightingale and Mother Theresa.Maggie's Smith's jowl-quivering Dowager is now falling perilously close to caricature, but again she plays it very well, and her better acerbic one-liners can still raise a laugh.Downstairs supervisor Mrs Hughes, who gets some of the best scenes to play, turns in a fine performance, but again, everybody is so ""controlled"" that all the excessive histrionics are left for the flighty little piece of new fluff upstairs, who is just so gushy and determined to be ""thoroughly modern"" that she seems to have walked in off the set of some amateur production of ""The Boyfriend"".(I was expecting her to break into ""Won't you Charleston with Me"" at any minute!)Her cheesy grinning and over-acting was so supremely irritating and she seemed such an unnecessary and superfluous addition to the cast that I'd have left her back in ye banks and braes of the Scottish Highlands.Dame Tiri Tekanawa has a brief cameo role as Australian opera singer Dame Nellie Melba, although her singing is the butt of some very derogatory remarks made downstairs by the new villain.Oh and if you'd forgotten just how irritating that damned ""ding-ding-ding-ding....ding-ding"" theme tune can get, .....you are very quickly reminded again. It's repeated endlessly!I call this the ""Series of Non-Events"".Some examples here in no particular order. ( I have deliberately avoided any mention here of ""THE ONE BIG DEAL"" in the plot. Anything below is inconsequential.)MINOR SPOILER ALERTS!!!1/ Lady Rigor-Mortis has the opportunity to remarry, and to a very promising man who professes undying love.....but she doesn't.2/Deceased Matthew's recently discovered but unwitnessed will may be disallowed, which would dis-inherit Lady Mary, ....but it isn't.3/The new triumvirate now running Downton are all set to evict the heir of a very long term tenant from his family holding.......but they don't.4/ It looks like a new young gardener is going to be unfairly dismissed for stealing bric-a-brac from Maggie Smith's drawing room, ...but he isn't.5/ Maggie Smith's character is made out to be dying at one stage, ...but of course she doesn't.6/ The ex-chauffeur now part Downton owner Tom Branson feels out of place in the upper class and plans to leave for America with his young daughter , ...but he doesn't.7/ It looks like Tom Branson is to be trapped into marriage by an unscrupulous re-employed maid feigning an opportune pregnancy to marry up into the cushy life, ...but he isn't.8/ It is made to appear that the young footman who has ambitions to be a chef misses his great opportunity at The Ritz, ...but he doesn't.9/ Mr. Molesley, a desperate out-of-work ex-employee who is reduced to working on the roads appears to have missed his opportunity of filling a recent vacancy at Downton, ...but he doesn't.10/ Mr Carson staunchly tries to maintain his decision not to have any contact with his old vaudeville partner, ....but he doesn't.11/ Evil Thomas (yes, he has relapsed since his apparent redemption last season) appears to be planning some great and nefarious scheme to benefit himself, ...but he doesn't.12/ At one stage there are fears that Bates' wife Anna may be pregnant, ...but she's not.13/ That new flouncy young thing at Downton annouces she's going to marry a ....Gasp! Shock!.....BLACK band singer, much to everyone's horror....but she doesn't.There are more than a few other examples, but suffice to say that the plotline consists of so many of these situations that have lots of potential, but then they are just allowed to fizzle out and the story creaks on maintaining the status quo as before.Perhaps some of these ideas may be further visited in ....god help us, ...Series Five?Well what did I enjoy I hear you ask?It must be said that once again there are some most beautiful settings. The apartment of the Aunt in London is truly magnificent. (Furniture and decor to die for!) There are also those aforementioned scene-stealing flower arrangements and of course the exteriors and countryside locations are all breathtaking in their story-book beauty. The briefly glimpsed tenant's farm is immaculate post-card perfection. The vintage cars, motorcycles and London bus are an enthusiast's delight, .....and even of interest to those who just enjoy seeing such well-maintained vintage pieces.The costumes too are truly sumptuous in their detail, ...although some particular dresses get rather too much wear. This may be a continuity problem but I can't see those upper class women turning up in the very same frock again and again in very quick succession.Overall the eight episodes are a quick watch.I managed this in two night sittings, and I guess for me the frustration came from the lack of any real tension, or development of any of the set-up situations. That and the sheer predictability of the thing. You always know exactly where this is going, and that makes it fall into the ""coffee-table book"" genre.You pick it up just to glance through the beautiful pictures, ...and on that level it succeeds very well.The potential was there for this to be so much more, but Fellowes seems reluctant to carry on his ideas from his initial concept to some sort of interesting narrative.The cast move about in front of the gorgeous settings like stilted paper dolls, ..beautifully costumed to be sure but shackled by the author's restrictive idea of period.Yes, we know that emotions were restrained back then, but it still has to hold interest for the viewer. A cast full of people all so doggedly maintaining that ""stiff-upper-lip"" do not make for engaging viewing.If half-star ratings were allowed I'd make this a 2 overall, but as they are not I'm giving it the THREE stars, ....and that's primarily for the undeniable visual appeal.There will of course be those who find all I've written above akin to heresy of the very highest order, but mistaking the style that this show has in abundance for substance which is almost totally lacking will no doubt be a common enough error.",3,The Life of Lady Rigor-Mortis and a Series of Non-Events.,1385683200,"11

Some viewers may see it that way and that is their right.  All of life changes, evolves and goes through ups and downs.  Life is a roller-coaster ride  -- ever more-so in the 21st Century.  It is the rare enterprise that can sustain a steady, constant ever upward trajectory.  The characters and the crew of Downton are the same stuff of humanity as the rest of us.  If Season 4 may lack the usual gravitas of what we have to appreciate on Masterpiece Theatre, that may be expected and may not come as a surprise.  It must be said that the novelty of Downton, after three (3) Seasons, may have worn off, and viewers have settled in, and it may be more difficult to surprise us.  Life has a way of being life: there are bills, there are struggles to keep and maintain our homes, there is ill-health and death, there are animals that must be cared for.  And there is the ever-present and continuing human drama, comedy, melodrama, and tumult of all of our lives be we aristocracy or servants or regular white and gray and blue-collar average everyday citizens.  There is a slightly different tone to Season 4, but life, whether fictional or real moves on.  None of us in our best days can maintain the quality of life to which we aspire.  Downton and most of British television, film, theatre, music -- the general cultural array -- still outshines American production and production values year in and year out.  America's cultural contributions to the world are now submitted by addled sophomoric fraternity boys and sorority girls.

1615772,A29CPAA1DCNXV5,B00AQVMZ1U,Lost in Siberia,"[15, 350]","1. Anemic drama. Drama is agon or contest, conflict, clash, disputation, etc., between pro- and antagonist, one of each at least. Even when one side is hostile fate or what the gods, God, history, society, etc., fling, throw against the promulgated hero and his cohort. Even when alleged lackeys and other social inferiors, impudent or inept, pester our dear noble sire, they will have some purpose, cause, justification, inspiration, cleverness, or whatever it takes, to make them worthy opponents, make the drama dramatic.But in ""Downton"" all potentially dramatic conflict is glossed over, brushed aside, too easily, unconvincingly, like dandruff on the Earl's tux. Even the deaths are convenient. The show is more infomercial than drama -- a soft-core selling of certain country mansions and owners. Has tourist traffic there increased? Do more good citizens see the glamour of the top 1% and understand that they deserve more power? That little people should be happy to serve?2. Strange rituals. A grown man dresses in a tuxedo to visit the bedroom of another grown man and help him, although he is able-bodied, get dressed into a fancier tuxedo, then finishes by brushing dandruff off the man's tux. Solemn, serious, like a religious ceremony. And this today has a fan-club.3. Hollowness of mind. Indicated by the apparent dominance over the Earl of contact language, the function of language we use when we ask the most asked question in our language, ""How are you?"", and give the most given answer, ""Fine, how are you?"".  Yes, necessary to some extent to establish that both sides know the language and its little rites of etiquette and are quite willing to obey these for the ease of relations or simply to get going. But what if all other functions of language -- and therefore thought and imagination -- and all social issues become mere extensions of this petty procedure and its superficiality, insouciance, and never go past these limits? When all questions and all answers are only repetition of formalities, customary chit-chat, ritualized trifles, signifying nothing but delusional shine around a hollow core or sordid mess? Call it entropy of spirit. What would Hamlet instead say, in mockery? Or Lear's bright fool?4. The Earl's rite of dinner and coziness of mind and the social hierarchy must not be disturbed -- as if that's the height of all human endeavor: dinner impeccably served. Through the 19th century aristocrats were already portrayed as more often useless or feeble-minded or archaic than not, as educated philistines or hollow costumes on parade, yet still with dangerous power over others, and then were blamed more than others for the blinkered narrow-mindness which led to the disaster known as the Great World War. Yet all this is swept under the fancy rugs of Downton Abbey. Where is the Spanish Inquisition when you need it? And aren't these the people who inspired Monty Python?5. Two antidotes to ""Downton"":The Remains Of The DayandFanny and Alexander (The Criterion Collecton Theatrical & Television Version). In ""Remains"" the butler and housekeeper come to recognize that their superb efforts on behalf of the lord of the manor were wasted due to the latter's sheer banality of thought and imagination, too fogged to clearly see the realities confronting him. ""Fanny and Alexander"" presents drama about European urban haute bourgeoise civilization at its height near the turn of the century, a family engaged both for and against aims beyond smug dinner every day forever.6. Fellini was a master of Dinner Disrupted. I'd love to see what he might have done with one long Downton dinner not going smoothly. When polite chit-chat and haute ritual pigging-out and obedient servants are confronted by something more substantial and subversive, with humor. My imagined scenario: one or two of the daughters on a trip to London meet a gang based somewhat on the Bloomsbury group and associates, and invite them to Downton where dinner then features the Earl and his family and other proper lords and ladies on one side of a long table, and on the other side characters loosely based on Virginia Wolf, her lover Vita, and Lytton Strachey, J.M. Keynes, Clive Bell, Bertie Russell and Alfie Whitehead, and T.S. Eliot and Aldous Huxley, and Lydia Lopokova too . . .  After more than a few drinks, the guests become impudent, more lewdly loquacious, confrontative and rambunctious. It will end very badly of course, interestingly so. Set it in that cruelest month, April.7. There are many buildings more admirable than Downton Abbey n&eacute;e Highclere Castle. The Scrovegni Chapel in Padua was financed in hope of atonement by a wealthy family famous for usury and therefore fearing punishment in Hell; Giotto's frescoes there offer a vision of Christianity at its best. The Palazzo dell'Accademia in Mantua was built, organized by aristocrats and other eminent citizens to promote knowledge and cultural advancement; its beautiful theater featured science demonstrations as well as art performances (the first musical evening presented a prodigy named Mozart). One can visit houses where Leonardo painted, Beethoven composed, Kafka wrote --all more admirable than the doings at Downton. Or sit in the Theater of Dionysus in Athens, or stand in front of the remains of Simon the Cobbler's shop where Socrates (not well-dressed) and his gang annoyed passers-by and talked of matters, questions unwelcome at Downton Abbey. I'd like to see more dramas set in these places, about these people. And the Baltimore housing projects in the first season of ""The Wire"" hosted more interesting conversations too.8. ""Tell me what you pay attention to and I will tell you who you are"" -Jos&eacute; Ortega y Gasset. The spiritual crisis of our age is revealed by our difficulty in differentiating between low and high, the slimy or stupid and the sublime, the tacky and the transcendent. Our most slavish, crude or mediocre appetitive inclinations have an easy time masquerading as something else. What's really presented for adulation? Call it Golden Calf Worship.

1615774,AOCVPRFNS2IKN,B00AQVMZ1U,Lover of English,"[4, 7]","I yield to no one in my appreciation of Julian Fellows's genius.  Downton Abbey is the best thing I've seen since I can remember and Season Four is terrific.  After all the turmoil and tension and bad feeling and heartbreak displayed in Season Three, Season Four comes as a healing wave.  The outstanding characteristic of this season is the flood of love that surrounds this house.  There are all kinds of non-romantic love duos: Violet and Isobel; Rosamund and Edith; Violet and Edith; Mary and Tom; Mrs. Patmore and Daisy, and others.However, as wonderful as this sense of peace and love is, I find that Julian Fellows has gone off the rails once again and written a scenario that is so implausible as to be unbelievable and this one is the latest in a trend.  Once a year Fellows flits off into never-never land and writes a scene that is impossible to credit.  First was Bates's trial; then we had the episode with Tom Branson's drugged cocktail and now there is the attack scene in Season Four.  Since the producers of Downton Abbey tell us in the bonus material how careful they are to be historically accurate why isn't someone checking Fellow's work before it is produced.Consider:  with young women today and even teen-aged girls engaging in every kind of sexual activity, with date-rape drugs rampant and after 40 years of women's liberation - men of today look at women very, very differently than did the men of the 1920s.  Most women in the 1920s came to marriage a virgin.  Women were cherished.  Women were protected.  In this environment, therefore, there is no way that a visiting servant would think that he could attack one of the Downton Abbey staff and get away with it.  The perpetrator would have to assume that the victim would tell the housekeeper who would tell the butler who would tell Lord Grantham and although the perpetrator probably wouldn't have been lynched, at the very least he would have been horsewhipped.  Only the viewing audience knows why the victim wouldn't have told anyone and I can assure Julian Fellows that none of us passed that information along to the perpetrator.Under no circumstances would the perpetrator have returned to the concert, bid his victim good night and casually sauntered into breakfast the next day unless he was insane.  He would have been anxious to put as much distance between Downton Abbey and himself as quickly as possible.  I am not asserting that women were never attacked in the 1920s but this scenario as written is completely unbelievable.I cannot understand why Julian Fellows, as hugely talented as he is, goes off on these weird tangents every so often and writes material that is so obviously impossible.  These bouts of irrationality are becoming a trademark.  There is another coming up in the 2013 Christmas Special in which a 21-year-old Rose will have her debut season.  I wrote about this in the review of the 2012 Christmas Special where it was hinted at.We were introduced to Rose at the end of Season Three.  She was 18.  In the 2012 Christmas Special &#34;one year later&#34; Rose was 19.  Season Four is six months later and Rose is 19-20.  The Christmas Special for 2013 is going to be about Rose's debut season and will take place in the following year: Rose will be 20-21.  Here we have another ridiculous implausibility.  The only reason why the Marquess and Marchioness of Flintshire would not have had their daughter presented when she was 18 - as everyone else did - was if she was in a sanitorium in Switzerland with TB - or for some equally serious medical reason.Fellows doesn't even try to explain why the girl was not presented along with all the other 18- year- olds; why her parents would have flouted tradition.  He ignores reality again and again and then boasts of the historical accuracy of the series.

Frankly, when Dan Stevens chose to leave the series the intelligent move on the part of Fellowes and the producers would have been to hire another actor to play &#34;Matthew&#34; so that the storyline of his and Mary's marriage and Matthew's moving into the role of running the estate could have been continued because Matthew was the &#34;future&#34; -- he was the young professional class -- an attorney -- who had inherited an estate and married into the aristocracy and at the same time saw that Branson, his Irish servant class  brother-in-law, was going to be a partner in the modernizing of the Downtown estate.  There were many stories that could proceed from that -- but by &#34;killing&#34; the character of Matthew,  Fellowes basically &#34;killed&#34; the core of the series.  Frankly, if he was going to kill the Matthew character, he may as well have ended the series altogether because the writing and plotlines in season four so far -- are inferior and reflect bad daytime soap opera writing.  Only the Dowager and Matthew Crawley's mother have any good lines and far too few IMO,  having Anna raped and then treat Bates like dirt in order &#34;to save him from himself&#34; for fear he would attempt to avenge what happened to her is a moment of &#34;jumping the shark&#34; which no series can afford to do and keep its audience.  The introduction of Edna as Cora's maid had no point.  The new ladies' maid appears to have a shady past -- so once again we are supposed to believe that the Granthams are so stupid that they'd continually hire terrible people to work for them when very obviously in the past they were smart enough to hire very good staff like Mrs. Patmore, Anna and Bates, Carson, Daisy, Alfred and Mrs. Hughes.  The character of Thomas remains static -- he's still a wretched man despite the fact that various members of the family and staff have shown compassion toward him in his time of despair at having been revealed to be homosexual in age when it could result in arrest and imprisonment.  Thomas has never been revealed to be a &#34;stupid&#34; man so one would assume that over time, he would change for the better as he realized that the entire world was not set against him -- nonetheless, once again he is thoroughly unpleasant this season and -- worse -- his character is now boring.I cringe at the knowledge that later this year the godawful Shirley Maclaine and her godawful character will return -- she's like nails on chalkboard -- and this time she'll be toting along Paul Giamatti -- ugh!I think the best thing we can all do now is enjoy re-watching the first three seasons which were entertaining despite being soap operaish -- because now it's just a soap opera and not terribly entertaining soap opera.",2,Tired series,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,2831,"[""'m"", 'not', 'purchasing', 'Season', 'Four', 'such', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'Frankly', 'when', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'chose', 'leave', 'series', 'intelligent', 'move', 'part', 'Fellowes', 'producers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hire', 'actor', 'play', '34', 'Matthew', '34', 'storyline', 'Mary', 'marriage', 'Matthew', 'moving', 'role', 'running', 'estate', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'continued', 'Matthew', 'was', '34', 'future', '34', 'was', 'young', 'professional', 'class', 'attorney', 'who', 'had', 'inherited', 'estate', 'married', 'aristocracy', 'same', 'time', 'saw', 'Branson', 'Irish', 'servant', 'class', 'brother-in-law', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'partner', 'modernizing', 'Downtown', 'estate', 'were', 'many', 'stories', 'could', 'proceed', '34', 'killing', '34', 'character', 'Matthew', 'Fellowes', 'basically', '34', 'killed', '34', 'core', 'series', 'Frankly', 'was', 'going', 'kill', 'Matthew', 'character', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'ended', 'series', 'altogether', 'writing', 'plotlines', 'season', 'four', 'so', 'far', 'are', 'inferior', 'reflect', 'bad', 'daytime', 'soap', 'opera', 'writing', 'Only', 'Dowager', 'Matthew', 'Crawley', 'mother', 'have', 'good', 'lines', 'far', 'too', 'few', 'IMO', 'having', 'Anna', 'raped', 'then', 'treat', 'Bates', 'dirt', 'order', '34', 'save', '34', 'fear', 'would', 'attempt', 'avenge', 'what', 'happened', 'moment', '34', 'jumping', 'shark', '34', 'series', 'can', 'afford', 'do', 'keep', 'audience', 'introduction', 'Edna', 'Cora', 'maid', 'had', 'point', 'new', 'ladies', 'maid', 'have', 'shady', 'past', 'so', 'once', 'again', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'Granthams', 'are', 'so', 'stupid', ""'d"", 'continually', 'hire', 'terrible', 'people', 'work', 'when', 'very', 'obviously', 'past', 'were', 'smart', 'enough', 'hire', 'very', 'good', 'staff', 'Mrs.', 'Patmore', 'Anna', 'Bates', 'Carson', 'Daisy', 'Alfred', 'Mrs.', 'Hughes', 'character', 'Thomas', 'static', 'still', 'wretched', 'man', 'fact', 'various', 'members', 'family', 'staff', 'have', 'shown', 'compassion', 'time', 'despair', 'having', 'been', 'revealed', 'be', 'homosexual', 'age', 'when', 'could', 'result', 'arrest', 'imprisonment', 'Thomas', 'never', 'been', 'revealed', 'be', '34', 'stupid', '34', 'man', 'one', 'would', 'assume', 'time', 'would', 'change', 'better', 'realized', 'entire', 'world', 'was', 'not', 'set', 'nonetheless', 'once', 'again', 'thoroughly', 'unpleasant', 'season', 'worse', 'character', 'now', 'boring.I', 'cringe', 'knowledge', 'later', 'year', 'godawful', 'Shirley', 'Maclaine', 'godawful', 'character', 'will', 'return', 'nails', 'chalkboard', 'time', ""'ll"", 'be', 'toting', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'think', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'now', 'enjoy', 're-watching', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'were', 'entertaining', 'being', 'soap', 'operaish', 'now', 'just', 'soap', 'opera', 'not', 'terribly', 'entertaining', 'soap', 'opera']",N/A

The main characters, whom we've come to know and love, are mostly present. However, Siobhan Finneran as Miss. O'Brien and Dan Stevens as Matthew Crawley are missing. I read that Stevens wanted off of the show. He is much missed in this season. I don't know why Miss O'Brien left the show. She is also sadly missed as one of the most interesting actors and characters in the show.The plotline of season 3 was a bit weak, and season 4 is weaker still. And yet I still love the series and hope its writers can come up with a more engaging 5th season. We have come to love the extended family and want to follow them through their lives. The acting is superb. The costumes and sets are a treat to the eyes. The camera work is excellent. The musical theme tugs at our emotions.

1615829,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B00AQVMZ1U,Melissa Niksic,"[3, 4]","I have nothing but sympathy for Julian Fellowes. Last season, &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; lost two lead characters when the actors portraying them decided they wanted to leave the show. No one could have anticipated that, so Season 4 of the show is really a rebuilding season. I was very, very worried for the first half of the season, which is just....really bad. Things do pick up considerably halfway through, but I still think this is the weakest season of the show by far. Without giving too much away, there is a terrible plot involving Anna that I absolutely hated...LEAVE THE BATES'S ALONE!!!!Many of the other plots this season are either bad, annoying, or just downright stupid. Daisy has never been my favorite character, but the dull love triangle between her, Ivy, and Alfred quickly grows tiresome. Edna returns to Downton for a stint as Cora's new lady's maid, and she is such a troublemaker! I hate her! Edith has always been an annoying and stupid character, and her storyline takes some ridiculous turns this season. Fellowes couldn't even really come up with anything original for her; he just recycles another character's storyline from earlier in the season. I also think that Maggie Smith is drastically underutilized for the first half of the season (fortunately she compensates for it in the later episodes, with some of her best zingers to date). Sherley MacLaine returns for the final episode reprising her role as Cora's mother, and again I was very disappointed in her performance, feeling that she was vastly underutilized. Paul Giamatti's guest role as Cora's brother is slightly more interesting, but just kind of odd.The best thing about the season by far is Lady Mary's storyline, focusing how she deals with Matthew's sudden death and takes on a more central leadership role at Downton. While I loved the Mary/Matthew romance and was very sad when Dan Stevens departed from the cast, I have come to believe that Matthew was sort of holding Mary back. We see more of the old Mary this season, the strong, unyielding Mary, who will likely be the reason for Downton's survival. There's also some romance as Mary considers getting back into the dating game, but she takes the whole courtship thing slow. We are left with two primary suitors for Mary, and while they're both okay blokes, I have to wonder if someone better suited for Mary might come along next season.Another surprise for me this season was how entertaining Rose's character has become. She was super annoying last season, but provided some much-needed comic relief this time around. Also, Isobel has always irritated me to no end, but that wasn't the case this season. Her character undergoes a bit of a transformation as she copes with the death of her only son and slowly returns back to life.

Nothing happened in this episode ,expect Mary moping, a nanny gets sacked because of Thomas' continuing bad behavior, Valentines cards have all the excitement of a wet edition of the daily paper. There is even a sense in Dame Maggie Smith that the zingers she has excelled at , are not filled with the insouciant humor that has marked all of her remarks in the past and she is frankly not sure how to bring them off any more than she can. The changes in dress, machines, etc are done rather than with a sense of humor mixed with anxiety practically without emotion.

1615934,A23M2D8GZPCWCV,B00AQVMZ1U,P. Carhart III,"[1, 1]","I've been chewing on these thoughts for a while and it's time to write them down. This is going to be a bit of a rant. In general, I felt that the writers basically repeated all of the same gimmicks from earlier seasons. Below you'll see what I mean.SPOILERS AHEAD!THE REPETITION:1. Thomas is still a jerk (Thomas is the token jerk throughout the series, but he at least enlisted our sympathies in season 2 and 3).2. Thomas still has uncanny power to influence the thinking of the gentry he serves, and they never question it, EVER. (re: every season)3. Uh oh, did Bates murder that guy or not?? (re: season 2 where we wondered if he had killed his wife)4. Speaking of Bates, he certainly knows a little about unsavory activities (re: season 3 when he's in prison)5. SCANDALOUS BABY ALERT! Fine, at least this time it was in the family instead of the servants (re: season 2, with Ethel)6. One of the servants is trying to better themselves again, specifically Alfred (re: season 1 when Gwen became a typist)7. Branson and Edna sittin' in a tree... but not really (re: season 3; why the heck did they even bring her back?)8. Lots of kitchen jealousy concerning Daisy, the guy she likes, and how it's unreciprocated (re: season 1, then again in season 3)9. Daisy once again gets an opportunity to leave Downton (re: season 3 when she was going to move in with Mr. Mason)10. Are Carson and Mrs. Hughes going to get together or not? All these romantic overtones and no follow through (re: every season, but can't remember specifics)11. Assorted men are pining for Mary, and they are willing to break off their other relationships for her (re: every season). On a side note, I NEVER understand why. She's a very disagreeable person, snobby as all get out, and not particularly interesting.12. Not ANOTHER scandalous relationship! (e.g. Lady Rose with the black singer, re: every season has a nontraditional relationship that makes all the high class ninnies gasp and gossip)13. Poor Mr. Molesley gets the short end of the stick, ALWAYS (re: every season since we first met him)14. Poor Lady Edith can never catch a break in her love life (re: every season)15. Good ol' rebellious Rose does everything she can to frustrate the expectations placed on her (re: season 3)OTHER THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:1. Anna is so righteous and innocent, and then you're going to have her abused like that? Such poor taste. I felt it was a cheap trick the writers came up with to shock us all, when maybe a lesser character would've been a better choice. I think they realized they didn't have the material to keep this season interesting, so they threw this in hoping to bolster the lack of drama.2. Thomas' motives for attacking Anna and Bates, as well as his hold over Baxter, felt completely contrived.3. Everyone is incredibly two-dimensional. In earlier seasons we sympathized with Mary, Lord Grantham, Cora, even Thomas, and honestly most of the characters. We also learned of the depth of Daisy, Carson and Mrs. Hughes. This season, I cared about NONE of them, excepting Anna and Bates (Bates only at the beginning), Lady Edith and Isobel Crawley. All the characters have the same mannerisms they've always had (I especially loathe Cora's peering-over-the-top-of-her-glasses-crooked-smile look, even though she isn't wearing glasses), they all say and do what you expect them to, and they have all the same problems. It felt like I was just watching everyone simply do their jobs and flit about with their usual petty squabbles. I couldn't even force myself to care.4. Branson was so FAIL in this season. Yes, I get that he needed to struggle with the death of his wife, but he was so whiney the entire season &#34;waah, I don't fit in&#34;, &#34;waah, I'm so lonely&#34;, &#34;waah, should I leave or not?&#34;, &#34;waah I don't have a political opinion any more&#34;. He starts a somewhat romantic interest with a smart girl he meets at a rally, but they don't develop that at all in the season.5. I also get frustrated with how EASY it is for the servants to sabotage each other (Spratt sabotaging Mr. Molesley, Thomas trying to sabotage everyone and succeeding, and something with Baxter blaming someone else for a mistake that was made sewing, can't remember exactly)6. I also didn't care about any of the characters they added, especially at the end.7. The pacing was better in the earlier seasons. I felt I knew who was who, what they were doing, and it all mattered. This season it seemed like they kept our heads spinning with numerous characters and problems, most of which didn't make any sense at all. I also never understood why they were having the parties they were having at Downton. It just felt like a hodge-podge of characters and activities. Maybe I just didn't really pay attention.THINGS I LIKED:1. I think Lady Edith is my favorite character. First of all, she rolls with Mary's unmerited disdain for her rather graciously, she has significantly more depth than the other characters, and she FINALLY found love, though of course it was destined to fail anyway.2. Isobel Crawley managed to add a dimension this season. I've been irritated by her in every season, up until Matthew died. It's good to see her humbled and be something other than holier-than-thou.3. I found Bates forgiveness/understanding towards Anna after everything went down rather moving. Even though I hate what happened to Anna, I felt the writers dealt with the intra-marital processing of it rather well. It was probably the only moment in this season where I felt something.Overall, I this this was an incredibly lackluster season that recycles what they've already done. Downton has lost its magic for me. I loved seasons 1-3, but something died in this one. It'll be interesting to see if they can recover it next season. I'm not getting my hopes up.",3,A very lackluster season.,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,5829,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'chewing', 'thoughts', 'while', 'time', 'write', 'down', 'going', 'be', 'bit', 'rant',

1615963,A1G619WDX45TYY,B00AQVMZ1U,"Reading Rocks ""Millbrae""","[11, 18]","UPDATED:  I re-viewed this Season 4 DVD recently (hoping that my opinion would change - but that isn't the case) and realized that it is missing key scenes.  For example: when everyone is leaving the house party, the scene where Gregson, Samson, and Edith are talking and Gregson returns the IOU to Samson - that ENTIRE scene is missing. There are others missing as well but I don't want to give out any spoilers. So if you think you are purchasing an UNCUT version, this is NOT it.  This same thing happened with the Season 3 DVD (several key scenes are missing).  I don't understand why they eliminate scenes on the DVD version???I'm  a HUGE fan of this series and couldn't wait until Season 4 premiered here in the U.S.  I already own Seasons 1 thru 3 so when Season 4 was released for sale on Jan. 28, I immediately purchased it.  I won't be giving any spoilers, however, suffice it to say that this Season 4 is just downright TERRIBLE!  There are plot lines that are SO unbelievable you have to scratch your head and wonder if Julian Fellowes and his writers were smoking something.  Example:  in one episode, a character has a huge problem and then the next episode is over 1 year later and the problem is ""solved"" and all we get is an explanation via words.Also, Mary has a couple of men interested in her which provides a good story line, however, the first man gets reacquainted with her after many, many years and 3 days later he's professing his undying love for her.  What???You never get a sense that any of this is believable because it happens SO quickly -- we're never allowed to see the relationships develop like they did between Mary and Matthew or Sybil and Tom or even Anna and Bates.  It's like Julian Fellowes is unsure whether the series will be picked up for another season, so he tries to cram tons of script (much of it unnecessary and not believable) into each episode.And frankly, the sarcastic-ness between Old Lady Grantham and Mrs. Crawley is really getting very old.  In this Aeason 4, Mrs. Crawley helps Violet to a great degree, yet Violet remains her nasty self with Isobel.  Also, we all know that Bates ""saved"" Mr. Barrow in Season 3, yet Barrow still continues to be nasty to Bates and Anna.Lastly, there are some really stupid story lines in this Season 4.  Surely Cousin Rose isn't a total idiot, yet she continuously makes stupid and hurtful decisions again and again.  It's like they gave her a mind of a 4 year old.  And yet once again, Tom Branson is having difficulty adjusting to his life as part of a rich family.  Really??? Hasn't he been living at Downton for the past 3-4 years?  That story line should have been signed-sealed-delivered ages ago.  Enough with that.And if I hear the words ""pig man"" one more time, I'll scream!What I liked?  the clothes, the set decoration, the old cars, and the story line between Alfred (the under-butler) and Daisy, the assistant cook.This Season is on 3 discs and contains ""The London Season"" which is the 2 hr concluding episode of this Season 4.",1,BE WARNED.....this DVD is missing lots of scenes!!!,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,3035,"['re-viewed', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'recently', 'hoping', 'opinion', 'would', 'change', ""n't"", 'case', 'realized', 'missing', 'key', 'scenes', 'example', 'when', 'everyone', 'leaving', 'house', 'party', 'scene', 'where', 'Gregson', 'Samson', 'Edith', 'are', 'talking', 'Gregson', 'IOU', 'Samson', 'ENTIRE', 'scene', 'missing', 'are', 'others', 'missing', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'out', 'spoilers', 'So', 'think', 'are', 'purchasing', 'UNCUT', 'version', 'NOT', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'several', 'key', 'scenes', 'are', 'missing', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'eliminate', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'version', ""'m"", 'HUGE', 'fan', 'series', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Season', '4', 'premiered', 'here', 'U.S', 'already', 'own', 'Seasons', '1', 'thru', '3', 'so', 'when', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'released', 'sale', 'Jan.', '28', 'immediately', 'purchased', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'giving', 'spoilers', 'however', 'say', 'Season', '4', 'just', 'downright', 'TERRIBLE', 'are', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'SO', 'unbelievable', 'have', 'scratch', 'head', 'wonder', 'Julian', 'Fellowes', 'writers', 'were', 'smoking', 'something', 'Example', 'one', 'episode', 'character', 'huge', 'problem', 'then', 'next', 'episode', '1', 'year', 'later', 'problem', 'solved', 'get', 'explanation', 'words.Also', 'Mary', 'couple', 'men', 'interested', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'however', 'first', 'man', 'reacquainted', 'many', 'many', 'years', '3', 'days', 'later', 'professing', 'undying', 'love', 'What', 'never', 'get', 'sense', 'believable', 'SO', 'quickly', ""'re"", 'never', 'allowed', 'see', 'relationships', 'develop', 'did', 'Mary', 'Matthew', 'Sybil', 'Tom', 'even', 'Anna', 'Bates', 'Julian', 'Fellowes', 'unsure', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'season', 'cram', 'tons', 'script', 'much', 'unnecessary', 'not', 'believable', 'episode.And', 'frankly', 'sarcastic-ness', 'Old', 'Lady', 'Grantham', 'Mrs.', 'Crawley', 'really', 'getting', 'very', 'old', 'Aeason', '4', 'Mrs.', 'Crawley', 'Violet', 'great', 'degree', 'yet', 'Violet', 'nasty', 'self', 'Isobel', 'Also', 'know', 'saved', 'Mr.', 'Barrow', 'Season', '3', 'yet', 'Barrow', 'still', 'be', 'nasty', 'Bates', 'Anna.Lastly', 'are', 'really', 'stupid', 'story', 'lines', 'Season', '4', 'Surely', 'Cousin', 'Rose', ""n't"", 'total', 'idiot', 'continuously', 'stupid', 'hurtful', 'decisions', 'again', 'again', 'gave', 'mind', '4', 'year', 'old', 'yet', 'once', 'again', 'Tom', 'Branson', 'having', 'difficulty', 'adjusting', 'life', 'part', 'rich', 'family', 'Really', 'Has', ""n't"", 'been', 'living', 'Downton', 'past', '3-4', 'years', 'story', 'line', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'signed-sealed-delivered', 'ages', 'ago', 'Enough', 'that.And', 'hear', 'words', 'pig', 'man', 'one', 'more', 'time', ""'ll"", 'scream', 'What', 'liked', 'clothes', 'set', 'decoration', 'old', 'cars', 'story', 'line', 'Alfred', 'under-butler', 'Daisy', 'assistant', 'cook.This', 'Season', '3', 'discs', 'London', 'Season', '2', 'hr', 'concluding', 'episode', 'Season', '4']",N/A

I doubt if they'd go on line and give Cheetos a five-star rating because they recognize a distinction between what they like and what is good.  When it comes to the arts, though, people are unable to make or even consider any such distinction.  If they like it, it's &#34;good.&#34;  You'll hear that a classically terrible movie like &#34;Plan 9 from Outer Space&#34; is &#34;so bad it's good.&#34;  This is, of course, impossible: an excess of bad doesn't equal good. What they mean, of course, is it's &#34;so bad it's enjoyable.&#34;Like  millions of other people I watched  the first three seasons of &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; religiously every week.  But I knew it was silly nonsense full of idiotic plot twists.  In a review of these seasons I pointed out its stupidity, but I gave it three stars anyay, as a sort of compromise between its quality and its watchability.  But I finally gave up in the fourth season, and now I can happily report I'm as free of Downton Abbey as I am of Cheetos. I'm not going to rehearse the absurdities of the plot, but let's have a little fun with the worthless characters.  Here are a few of the characters we are supposed to care about:*.  The Earl of Grantham--a cross between the silly-ass, clueless aristocrat best captured by PG Wodehouse in his novels about Lord Emsworth and his pig and the equally clueless, pompous, self-righteous fathead Lord Darlington in &#34;remains of the Day.&#34;*  his wife--Here the problem is not so much the characters as the actress. Elizabeth McGovern.  I've never met anyone who could stand that sweet/sad crooked smile of hers.You just want to hit it with a Boston Cream Pie.*  Carson the butler-- See comments about the Earl.  We are asked to believe that he was once a music hall performer who was abandoned by his true love.  I prefer to think he is a priest defrocked for his inability to keep his hands off the choirboys.* Bates--Oh come on!  This character makes no sense at all.  In this fourth season he travels to London by train to kill his wife's rapist.  But the shmuck neglects to destroy the ticket stub that proves he was in London! In fact, he leaves it in his coat pocket.*Dowager Countess of Grantham--Maggie Smith was the only reason to watch the first season.  She was, of course,, playing a version of Lady Bracknell from &#34;the Importance of Being Ernest.&#34;  But they've softened the character to such a degree that she no more fun.* Lady Edith Crawley (Matthew's mother)--There used to be (and for all I know still is) a comic strip called &#34;Mary Worth,&#34;  whose eponymous heroine kept interfering with everybody's else's life.  (I remember a MAD Magazine parody in which someone asked her, &#34;What do you do actually beside sticking your nose in everybody else's business?&#34;)  Well, here she is, little Miss Do-gooder*Tom Branson--This is the Irish Catholic Socialist revolutionary chauffer who improbably marries one of the daughters. The actor's Irish accent reminds me of what the Harvard Lampoon said of Ryan O'Neal in &#34;Barry Lyndon&#34;:  &#34;His Irish accent wouldn't fool Fernando Lamas.&#34; Now I know the actor is from Dublin, but I'm from Brooklyn and I don't sound like Sheldon Leonard or Tom Pedi (anyone remember them?)Well, that was sort of fun (for me at least).

1615982,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00AQVMZ1U,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[1, 2]","The fourth season of &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; (not including two Christmas specials) attempts to recapture some of the original spark that made its first season such a success, and comes about as close as it&#8217;s ever going to get. After the trauma of World War I and the deaths of two beloved family members (sadly necessary due to the actors leaving for other projects), the show can settle down and become the frothy soap-opera that it&#8217;s always been at heart. Only now, no one is pretending that it&#8217;s anything else.SPOILERS BELOWSet in the mid-1920s, the fourth season opens with Mrs O&#8217;Brian sneaking away in the night, another causality of an actress deciding to call it quits &#8211; though in this case, at least she made it out alive &#8211; and Countess Grantham starting the search for another lady&#8217;s maid.  Fellowes wisely decides to open the season six months after Matthew&#8217;s death in a car accident, thus sparing us the rawness of his passing (it was painful enough with Sybil), and depicting Mary as a young widow who believes she has little left to live for.From start to finish this season is packed full of your favourite melodrama tropes: love triangles, out-of-wedlock pregnancy, murder, rape, doomed relationships, half-orphaned children, impassioned declarations of love &#8211; it&#8217;s all here, and it&#8217;s embraced with a whole-hearted awareness of how silly it all is. And I honestly say that with affection. I don&#8217;t watch &#8220;Downton Abbey&#8221; for historical accuracy or sophisticated plots or &#8211; heck &#8211; even character development. I watch because it&#8217;s light, glossy, pleasant fluff. No apologies.But season four turns out to be something of a mixed bag. Though I enjoyed the depiction of Mary&#8217;s movement from bleak despair to a renewed interest in life, I wasn&#8217;t at all impressed by her new bevy of suitors (in fact most of the time I couldn&#8217;t even tell them apart). Hapless Moseley and long-suffering Edith are once again put through the wringer, but this time they face their tribulations with spunk and fortitude, giving audiences a good reason to cheer them on.Poor Tom Branson used to be such a firecracker, yet now he keeps falling miserably into the machinations of calculating women, and whatever character development was afforded to Thomas has now been obliterated in favour of once more making him Downton&#8217;s resident puppet-master (how he still has a job is beyond me). The tedious love triangle between Daisy, Ivy and Alfred continues to stretch on downstairs, boring everyone including the participants, and poor Daisy keeps shutting down the prospects that open up all around her (Gwen was allowed to leave Downton in order to pursue career opportunities elsewhere &#8211; why not Daisy?)Yet contrary to what most viewers seem to think, I quite enjoy Cousin Rose and her light-hearted hijinks, though Lord and Lady Grantham continue to be the most oblivious people on the planet. I&#8217;m sure that Cora used to be the sharpest and most observant member of the household &#8211; now she&#8217;s an utter dimwit who consistently trusts the wrong people and doesn&#8217;t notice the most obvious occurrences happening right under her nose.Something truly lovely comes out of the Violet/Isabel relationship &#8211; at the start of the show they were so at odds with one another, and now something very close to a prickly friendship has formed (though neither one of them would ever admit it). That goes ditto for Mary and Anna&#8217;s friendship of quiet respect and support, and of course, the &#8220;platonic marriage&#8221; that exists between Carson and Mrs Hughes; surely the backbone of the entire household.All that said, there is one particularly dark point during the course of the season that was met with outrage and disgust from &#8220;Downton&#8221; viewers, and that was the controversial rape of one of its most popular characters at the hands of a visiting valet. Anna has been the moral centre of Downton from the show&#8217;s inception, and though we (mercifully) don&#8217;t see the act itself, the build-up and the fallout is harrowing enough, coming as quite a slap in the face to unsuspecting viewers. That Anna was chosen as the &#8220;victim&#8221; of such a crime was a strategic ploy, knowing that she was loved and admired by the audience. Would the controversy have been as pronounced, if this storyline had played out between &#8211; let&#8217;s say &#8211; Jimmy and Ivy? I doubt it.The aftermath is even more troublesome, for even though I give Fellowes credit for not victim-blaming Anna or glossing over the trauma that comes in the wake of a sexual assault, the storyline that follows is much more focused on Bates and *his* pain over what&#8217;s happened than Anna herself (and Anna&#8217;s insistence that Bates not be told what&#8217;s happened to her in case he takes revenge on her attacker means that every other woman in the house is put at risk because of BATES&#8217;S stubbornness).Yet despite this, there are some highpoints that make up for the sour notes. Violet giving her bereaved grand-daughter a simple &#8220;I love you.&#8221; The magnificent Mrs Hughes confronting Anna&#8217;s rapist. Mrs Patmore expressing to Daisy how proud she is of her. A fun sequence in which Rose strikes up a rapport with a village boy before scurrying to conceal her identity. Several touching scenes between siblings-in-law Tom and Mary, both lost without their spouses and struggling to support each other. And finally, Edith fighting for her right to happiness and taking matters into her own hands when it comes to the future.There are return appearances from past characters such as Evelyn Napier, Charlie Grigg and Mr Mason, and a guest appearance from New Zealand opera singer Dame Kiri Te Kanawa as Dame Nellie Melba. There&#8217;s even a long overdue update from Gwen, not seen since the first season.What else can be said other to say that it&#8217;s quintessential &#8220;Downton Abbey&#8221;, with everything you&#8217;ve come to expect. As ever, the costumes, set design, score and cinematography are a high-point, all beautifully and meticulously presented to create a visual encapsulation of the mid-1920s. Say what you will about his plotting (or the man himself) creator Julian Fellowes knows how to give his actors witty, breezy dialogue, and though I wish he would pull back on the romance (never his strong point), there are a variety of familial and platonic interactions that are as compelling as they are unique, existing between sisters, in-laws, friends, rivals, and of course masters/servants, the relationship which has always been the bedrock of this show.",3,"&#8220;If I was in Search of Logic, I Should not Look for It Among the English Upper Class.&#8221;",1394150400,"03 7,

And I was pleased with the special features. One point: The final episode is 2 3/4 hours long, referred to as ""The London Season,"" and I was amazed at how quickly those nearly 3 hours flew.

We have the same richly textured character interest and the same superb production and acting.  However, we can't avoid a feeling of disappointment as some of the plot lines have slipped into cliches and political correctness. Indeed we have a sense that we have descended into a rather ordinary soap opera, overlaid with our post modern norms and mores.  Whereas the Thomas gay plot line had been handled with sophistication and realism, we now need to be hit over the head with the obligatory racial bigotry bit.  Oh please, we know all about it.  But why include the racial sub plot while ignoring the Irish rebellion that was ongoing at the time?  It is 1922 after all, and the Branson character is portrayed as sensitive to the plight of the Irish worker and workers generally.  While I am at it, it seems that the Branson character's continual playing of Hamlet about his true allegiances has become trite and tiresome in the 4th season.  And along with the racial plot line, we have the equally hackneyed rape story line that hits us over the head yet again by telling us how difficult it was for a poor working girl to deal with a violent sexual attack by someone in a superior social position.Summing up, the series is still well worth watching for its sparkling performances by many of the cast (the interplay between Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton is pure pleasure), but be prepared for an overlay of post modern cliches that take much of the luster off the goings on.",3,Becoming cliche-ridden and politically correct,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,1593,"['wife', 'looked', 'forward', 'Season', '4', 'great', 'anticipation', 'first', 'blush', 'were', 'not', 'disappointed', 'have', 'same', 'richly', 'textured', 'character', 'interest', 'same', 'superb', 'production', 'acting', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'avoid', 'feeling', 'disappointment', 'plot', 'lines', 'have', 'slipped', 'cliches', 'political', 'correctness', 'Indeed', 'have', 'sense', 'have', 'descended', 'rather', 'ordinary', 'soap', 'opera', 'overlaid', 'post', 'modern', 'norms', 'mores', 'Thomas', 'gay', 'plot', 'line', 'had', 'been', 'handled', 'sophistication', 'realism', 'now', 'need', 'be', 'hit', 'head', 'obligatory', 'racial', 'bigotry', 'bit', 'Oh', 'please', 'know', 'why', 'include', 'racial', 'sub', 'plot', 'ignoring', 'Irish', 'rebellion', 'was', 'ongoing', 'time', '1922', 'Branson', 'character', 'portrayed', 'sensitive', 'plight', 'Irish', 'worker', 'workers', 'generally', 'am', 'Branson', 'character', 'continual', 'playing', 'Hamlet', 'true', 'allegiances', 'become', 'trite', 'tiresome', '4th', 'season', 'racial', 'plot', 'line', 'have', 'equally', 'hackneyed', 'rape', 'story', 'line', 'head', 'yet', 'again', 'telling', 'how', 'difficult', 'was', 'poor', 'working', 'girl', 'deal', 'violent', 'sexual', 'attack', 'someone', 'superior', 'social', 'position.Summing', 'up', 'series', 'still', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'sparkling', 'performances', 'many', 'cast', 'interplay', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'pure', 'pleasure', 'be', 'prepared', 'overlay', 'post', 'modern', 'cliches', 'take', 'much', 'luster', 'goings']",N/A

Main plot for three seasons was Mary and Matthew (Michelle Dockery and Dan Stevens had huge chemistry).  Now the plots are getting boring (Ivy, James, Alfred, Daisy=BORING!!!) .  A series &#34;Jumps the Shark&#34; when &#34;long-lost relatives&#34; are added on (Cousin Oliver on Brady Bunch, cousins on Happy Days, cousins and long-lost siblings on Little House on the Prairie, original Beverly Hills 90210).  There was no reason to add Cousin Rose to Downton, when Julian Fellowes could have focused his attention on Mary, Branson and particularly Edith and her relationship with Gregson.  I wanted to see Edith become a famous writer.  The addition of the black character is weak.  The rape of Anna and how it is resolved is extremely disappointing.  Mary's suitor Blake (Julian Ovenden) is poor casting, as the actor is 4 inches shorter than Michelle Dockery (Mary) and it's very awkward.  Three men, all good looking and rich, in their mid to late 30s still single after &#34;The Great War,&#34; is unrealistic. The dialogue was terrible &#34;Mary, you fill my head up!&#34;  Please!!!  Edith's baby mess was ridiculous.  Elizabeth McGovern's acting has gotten so much worse (look at her face when Anna and Bates run into her at a restaurant).  Finally, Branson's school teacher lady friend is about 4'9 inches tall and annoying.

After watching the first 2-hour episode of Season 4, I now think the writers are writing in their sleep.  When Maggie Smith seems dull, this show is in big trouble.  Then, we have one conflict after another, as if the writers think the viewers will jump up and turn off the TV if something doesn't happen to someone every other minute.  How many conflicts do you need in one 2- hour episode?  That episode is definitely going to make it easier for me to totally stop watching the show, if I decide to do so.  After reading of the horrific thing that is going to happen to sweet Anna in the next episode, there is a very good chance that I am going to do so, too.  Julian Fellowes obviously doesn't realize how many viewers watch ""Downton Abbey"" for entertainment and escape.  That's too bad and too sad.Afterthoughts 1/14:  I am really going to miss Violet, Edith, Mrs. Hughes, Daisy, Mrs. Patmore, Anna, Mr. Bates, Mr. Carson, Isobel, Dr. Clarkson, Mr. Molesley, Sir Anthony, Ethel and Miss O'Brien.  I did not watch the episode last Sunday night about Anna, and will never watch another new episode.  I am finished.I am finished being jerked around by Julian Fellowes, when he's in the mood to add a strong dose of ""realism"" to a show that is ironically based on a fantasy--the fantasy  that the upstairs and downstairs residents were like one big, caring family back in the early 1900s. Mr. Fellowes should have stuck to his fantasies, and continued entertaining us with an astoundingly addictive and fun to watch show.No, I will never watch ""Downtown Abbey"" again unless I read that there is a new episode where all of the characters on the show, including Sybil and Matthew, wake up screaming one night from nightmares . . . only to have all of their terrors quickly disappear. . . when they all fully awake and realize that Season 3 & Season 4 were only bad dreams . . . very, very bad dreams.",2,"The Sleeping Writers Are Creating A Nightmare . . .

1616089,A18ECWTWII1KSU,B00AQVMZ1U,susannah,"[3, 4]","I was very anxious to see this new season on dvd, and have just finished it. There is some that is pretty good, some that is really good, and sadly, some that is not so good, but even with frustration with some of the plot lines, the acting is for the most part, excellent.SPOILERS..........................SPOILERS.......................SPOILERS......................SPOILERS..............................There seemed to be some reversion to character traits of earlier seasons, which was unfortunate, since we had seen some development. I don't think it was just being with Matthew that ""changed"" Mary,"" but I had hoped, some maturing through the war, etc. All that is gone, and Mary is completely cold and self absorbed again. Even though Anna was expected to, and did, help her carry Pamuk's dead body to his room so that Mary's secret might be kept, and even though Bates left his job, his security, his happiness, to return to psychowoman, so that Mary's secret might be kept, when Mary was faced with the choice to keep his or not, what did she tell Mrs. Hughes? ""it's a man's life, it's WRONG."" She had no proof that Bates was the killer but was that ready to sell him out. ONLY when Bates yet AGAIN saved her family and the monarchy from another embarrassing scandal did Mary change her mind.  Mary is loyal only to her position. Period. It broke my heart, and Carson's, when she was cruel to him. I am glad he got in the last shot. Nor did she tell Anna or Bates what she had done with the ticket, so Bates has to live in worry.I thought there were some layers of human complexity in Thomas last season, but that too is all gone. He is back to being ""one note"" evil, causing trouble for everyone for no apparent reason. Additionally, the thing with the Nanny was clunky. He was trying to get her in trouble, but she cooked her own goose when Cora heard what she said to Sybbie, which had nothing to do with Thomas. In contrast, the guy who plays him, from what I have seen in the extra features, seems to be a nice guy. He is good at being bad! I wonder what if it had been Tom who heard Nanny, and what he would have done to her. Sadly, there were probably many many children of ""privilege"" who were at the mercy of nannies and governesses like Nanny West, and even still.I thought it was too bad that both Robert and Cora seemed to suffer from extreme amnesia this season, to the point of seeming demented. First, when Thomas and Braithwaite were pointing fingers at Anna, saying she was being mean, they believe them, even though they know Anna is the sweetest person ever, and is never mean to anyone! They even speak to Bates about her. Totally wrong. It was the same in the scene where Thomas is complaining to Robert about the other staff and Robert said, ""are you not liked downstairs?"" Never mind that there were incidents of theft and attempts to frame Bates in earlier seasons, and what kind of person Thomas is, which Robert well knows. Amnesia, I say.  Robert and Cora should have laughed Thomas out of the room. Why is he still working there? I was glad Braithwaite got kicked out early on, and loved her smackdown by Mrs. Hughes. Additionally, when Violet was questioning Robert about his wanting total control of the estate, I too was thinking, yeah, because you have done so well with that up til now!""Now Edith. She seems to present as a sympathetic character for alot of people, but she isn't to me. While Mary is not a nice person, she never did anything to really hurt Edith in the first season, yet what Edith did to her by telling the Turkish guy what happened to Pamuk, would have ruined Mary's entire life, if she had not married Matthew. She would have never married and even worse, have been shut out of the society she lived for. I thought it perfect karmic justice that Edith was jilted at the altar, losing her chance to marry, and now experiencing what would cause equal scandal for her. I wanted her to remember what she did to Mary, but the show didn't go there. I have to say that Cora and Mary were pretty blind to not know Edith was pregnant, since they knew she had a boyfriend,had to have started to show, and suddenly off to Switzerland for months. Stevie Wonder would know. I thought Violet's reaction was great.."" I see I will have to take the slow path"" but not judgmental, nor was she of Sybil and Tom. For all her clinging to the old ways, she was pretty down to earth with her granddaughters and matters of love and sex. It was funny how Robert chastised Dr Clarkson for saying the word ""urine"" in front of her! Tis a mystery what happened to Gregson. If the Nazis killed him, they would have found a body? They didn't have camps yet in 1922 I don't think. has he faked his death? Why would he give Edith his power of attorney?I didn't like Rose at all. She was a spoiled little rich girl who didn't give a thought to anyone else, but wanted what she wanted. No replacement at all for Sybil, who was a real person, with  brains and a heart. I SO miss Sybil. Matthew was a nice guy but I loved Sybil. I wish that Cora's mother had been there when Sybil was dying. She would have thrown Sir I Know it All out the window, got Sybil to the hospital, and saved her. I absolutely think Dr Clarkson was right and would have saved her, had they listened to him. I agree with Cora, and didn't want her to reconcile with Robert, even though Violet pushed her to. It was completely Robert's and Sir Know it All's fault.I thought the Daisy/Ivy/Alfred/Jimmy adolescent posturings went on interminably, but Daisy and Mrs Patmore's relationship matured, which was nice to see.I got really tired of seeing Molesley whining and feeling sorry for himself. I liked how he stood up for Baxter though, helping her to feel better about herself, and hopefully telling Thomas to go jump in the lake. I see a relationship developing there, no matter what she's done.The pig stuff was dumb. When DID Mary learn to make eggs?Cora's mother and brother stuff was dumb and unnecessary. Also the cloak and dagger spy stuff in trying to get the letter back. If it was that important, maybe girlfriend shouldn't have had it in her bag and then left her bag unattended!What was REALLY good...Anna's storyline, and her acting. She brought it!!! I hope they have British Emmys, she should definitely win. I really wanted her to go to the police after she knew Bates knew though. I thought that she was selling him a bit short for being so sure that he would kill Green, and ruin their lives together. I LOVE Mrs Hughes, she is such a badass! I thought she was going to kill Green with her bare hands, and I bet she could have. Such great scenes with Anna, with Green, with Braithwaite, with Carson. ALL of them. It's such a shock to see her on the show and then how she looks in real life, a decade younger, like Mrs. Patmore. I also love Carson. He is absolutely old school, and is judgmental and rigid and everything else, but it is his job to make sure everything goes right. It was all on his shoulders. He does have a caring heart though. He adores Mary, though I am with Mrs Hughes on that, and I loved the scene with he and Sybbie. One of my favorite scenes was when he had just found out Mrs Hughes was okay, and he was singing and laughing while he polished the platter, so unlike him, but so sweet. The final scene of this season is right up there too, with Carson in BARE feet, wading, and holding Mrs. Hughes' hand for security! Others think they should be married, I don't know, but even if not, their friendship is wonderful to see.I don't think Bates is the killer. It would take alot of things to fall into place to take the train to another town, rent a car, find where the guy lives, follow him to where you would be able to hit him, with no one seeing it, or you, then returning the car and getting back on the train. It is possible he had someone else do it, but they would have the same problems. He was hit by a car right?  I think it was an accident. I wanted someone to kill him, but slowly. I can only imagine how many victims he had. As vulnerable as women have always been to sexual assault, I feel sure that women and girls in service positions were especially easy to victimize.Tom matured this season, I thought. I didn't like him when he was with Sybil. He was controlling, willing to let her sacrifice everything in her life for him but gave up nothing for her,not wanting her to ""disappoint him"" I hated that, or to have ideas about their child that disagreed with his, and not even treating her family with the slightest respect, when they were sheltering him and even keeping his ass out of prison. I understood and agree with where he was coming from but he could have given Sybil that much.He was a jerk but did start to grow up after Sybil's death.  I think maturity involves the ability to not only see your corner, but the other guy's as well, including the English, and he was getting there. It was such irony to see him dancing at the ball with monarchy. I wonder if the ""troubles"" are going to rear their head again next season, since one of the guys after Mary has a castle and holdings in Ulster, which I believe is in Northern Ireland. How would Tom deal with Mary becoming an occupier?I LOVE LOVE LOVE Dame Maggie Smith. I love her snarkiness and her wisdom.  Her scenes with Isobel were gold. It was well done how Isobel could have gladly strangled her, yet when Violet was ill, wouldn't leave her side. Even sick, Violet had good lines! The scene where they are playing cards and having fun together is great. I had a sad moment though, in seeing her ill scenes, to realize she is nearly eighty years old. She is a treasure, and always will be.This show is a treasure as well, even with all its faults. It has stellar performances and often excellent writing. I don't compare it in any way with Upstairs Downstairs. This is its own entity, and it is awesome to see how many people around the world love this show.",5,"On the whole, still fabulous!!!",1392854400,"02 20, 2014",2014,9981,"['was', 'very', 'anxious',

Why does British tv always pick actors with the worst American accents? They make us sound so odd. And why do we always have to be loud, obnoxious, wide eyed, eager, big mouthed, rude, and effusive? Are we single dimensional?Shirley McClaine only appears in the last episode, but the banter between her character and Violet is stale. It was funny the first time. Now they both just look like harpies.This season moves really fast compared to previous ones. It's bam, bam, bam! This one's in, now she's out. This happens and then it's over. While the pace of previous seasons seemed slow before, now it seems to fit because those were slower times. Maybe that is why they've sped things up. It feel jarring.The good:Basically what is good about it is all the things that we all liked before. There are the spectacular costumes, acting, sets, and historical backdrops. The characters are still interesting. I feel they have replaced breadth for depth, but they are still good. The stories are fresh. You can see how prosperity is returning after the war. I liked the attention paid to Branson's evolution. It will be interesting to see how that plays out. The competition for Mary is also interesting. I thought the pacing for that was good.

As the beginning started with a bang, the pace some what slowed almost to a fizzle mid way, and sparked back up immediately. The Christmas Special episode was intriguing indeed as the Crawley's invade London for the social season and assist in the presentation of Lady Rose MacClare in the Royal courts to King George V & Queen Mary. I was hoping that the clothes, jewels, and scenery would have been even more elaborate as I'm accustomed to from Julian Fellowes. Nevertheless it was sufficient. Perhaps there were budgetary constraints? I anticipated over the top scenery for a Buckingham palace setting as in those times things were indeed most ostentatious!
