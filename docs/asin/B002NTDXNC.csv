Even though the actual actors from the movies weren't involved, all the voices were still good. I just wish more episodes we're created but hey some is better than none. I would recommend to any true Friday fan.",4,Need More!,1260489600,"12 11, 2009",2009,343,"['Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'more', 'black', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'turned', 'cartoons', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'adults', 'lol', 'Even', 'actual', 'actors', 'movies', 'were', ""n't"", 'involved', 'voices', 'were', 'still', 'good', 'just', 'wish', 'more', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'created', 'hey', 'better', 'none', 'would', 'recommend', 'true', 'Friday', 'fan']",Friday: The Complete Animated Series

Therefore, I wanted to show my support to this cartoon series which I enjoyed as well.  I am in school and doing homework can be rather intense.  I put on this CD and it really helped me to relax and not be so tense while studying.

1280150,A1AK9361RO53XG,B002NTDXNC,NickKnack,"[1, 2]",I absolutely loved Friday so it's only natural that I heart the cartoon! The show wasn't on Mtv long and I don't know why?? All the characters were fairly on point and they even snuck in some fan fav's such as Pinky and Money Mike! This will make a great stocking stuffer for my Dad who is a huge Friday fan.,4,Great idea!,1260489600,"12 11, 2009",2009,308,"['absolutely', 'loved', 'Friday', 'only', 'natural', 'heart', 'cartoon', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'Mtv', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'characters', 'were', 'fairly', 'point', 'even', 'snuck', 'fan', 'fav', 'such', 'Pinky', 'Money', 'Mike', 'will', 'make', 'great', 'stocking', 'stuffer', 'Dad', 'who', 'huge', 'Friday', 'fan']",Friday: The Complete Animated Series

It was a show that came on MTV a channel that prides itself on being hip,now and in well this show is all of that and funny as hell I guarantee you will be picking yourself up off the floor after just the first episode ""hardly working "" the animation is excellent with all the characters looking funny and just believable enough,(if u do decide to get this b sure to look in the background there is a lot of cool and funny stuff going on!) The humor is right on time placed expertly at key moments, just flat out funny for all people there's some cussing but nothing too bad, sound is excellent loud and clear, it is a great product, if you haven't seen the movies do yourself a favor and get them as this is a direct continuation of them you may find this even funnier the truly sad part is I won't be able to see anymore episodes I would have followed this to season 10!!  Report card: condition A+  arrival time A+++  case and disc A+  get this!!!",5,Friday : or any day of the week,1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,1053,"['Well', 'here', 'am', 'again', 'wondering', 'why', 'something', 'as', 'good', 'got', 'canceled', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'was', 'show', 'came', 'MTV', 'channel', 'being', 'hip', 'now', 'well', 'show', 'funny', 'hell', 'guarantee', 'will', 'be', 'picking', 'floor', 'just', 'first', 'episode', 'hardly', 'working', 'animation', 'excellent', 'characters', 'looking', 'funny', 'just', 'believable', 'enough', 'u', 'do', 'decide', 'get', 'b', 'sure', 'look', 'background', 'lot', 'cool', 'funny', 'stuff', 'going', 'humor', 'right', 'time', 'placed', 'expertly', 'key', 'moments', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'funny', 'people', 'cussing', 'nothing', 'too', 'bad', 'sound', 'excellent', 'loud', 'clear', 'great', 'product', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movies', 'do', 'favor', 'get', 'direct', 'continuation', 'may', 'find', 'even', 'funnier', 'truly', 'sad', 'part', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'see', 'anymore', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'followed', 'season', '10', 'Report', 'card', 'condition', 'A+', 'arrival', 'time', 'A+++', 'case', 'disc', 'A+', 'get']",Friday: The Complete Animated Series
