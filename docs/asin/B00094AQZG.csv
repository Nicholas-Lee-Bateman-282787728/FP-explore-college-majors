900857,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00094AQZG,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 16]","Monk is an addiction.  He is the character that we wish we could turn off, but instead find ourselves watching from beginning to end because, while the episodes are formulaic, Adrian Monk is appealing.  He has troubles, like you or I, and isn't afraid to let them do what he loves.  He loves his job as well as his late wife Trudy.  Throughout the first two seasons, we had the opportunity to develop these bonds.  We had to chance to welcome Adrian into our homes with all of his problems and embrace him for the kind, sensitive detective that he is.  He brought laughter by his side, he brought criminals to justice, and he would be utterly frightened, but would be happy to take a bullet for any of his friends - like Stottlemeyer or Sharona.  ""Monk"" was a television show that worked because of the simplicity of the story along with the themes.  It wasn't as disgusting or dark as ""C.S.I."", but we didn't want it to be - we wanted our Adrian and friends to continue what they were doing through season three, hoping to develop more about what a happened with his wife, but instead ... DISASTER STRUCK.We all know the saying, ""Don't change horses mid-race"", well (and I am probably not the first to attest to this using any forum), the television series ""Monk"" did, and subsequently lost a devoted viewer along the way.  Should I use the term ""spoiler"" with this?  I am not sure, but I must warn those just now getting into the series that Sharona Fleming disappears midway through this season.  There I said it.  Don't shoot me, you probably already know this, but it destroyed the chances for season four to make it to my player for at least three months.  I need time to cope with this loss.  That truth is, what upsets me the most, is that we lost Sharona and was replaced by someone who doesn't know Adrian Monk.  She doesn't respect the man that was presented to us for two whole seasons.  From the beginning of our introduction to Ms. Natalie Teeger, she tries her hardest to change Mr. Monk.  This isn't bad, we all realize that he is ready for anything, but the actress's portrayal comes across as bitter, nagging, and almost to the point of violent.  She does not work with Mr. Monk like Sharona did, but instead battles him on every decision made in which the writers feebly attempt to define this as humor.  This is a defining season for me because I feel like I lost a friend, and not one that could be easily replaced, but was wiped out without a chance of saying goodbye.  It was pathetic, and it hurt.They changed the theme music (yet the quirkiness of the show is that you can continually hear it in the background whenever needed to bring us back into the essence of the show), they changed Monk's therapist, and they managed to go another season without really explaining the reason behind his wife's mysterious death.  All of this, and yet, I will watch the fourth season.  I will mutter under my breath about the nasty changes, yet continue to view each and every episode.  Why?  I love the character of Adrian Monk.  I love the fact that he is building this amazing re-relationship with Captain Stottlemeyer.  One of my favorite episodes from this season was when he and Stottlemeyer were in Vegas solving a murder case.  That, to me, was the complete epitome of what makes this show amazing.  Now, if we could only find a way to change back to Sharona - but I think that is an unbeatable mission.Overall, I am not as happy with this season as I have been with other seasons.  While I realize that this is only my third year with Mr. Monk, I am not happy with any of the big changes.  I think these changes make me fear for the stability of the show, but Tony Shalhoub is bankable.  He makes this show worth going back to even when the surrounding characters make it look grim.  The writing seemed better in this season, the mysterious seemed more fun and developed (another favorite was when Monk was buried and has visions of his wife), and there were some very comedic scenes.  I am going to try to allow these massive changes in this season to whisk away from my shoulders, but I cannot make any promises.  I want Sharona back - if I could shout that from the highest mountain I would.As of this time, season three is my least favorite season.  I loathe the character named Natalie Teeger, but I can be patient.  Who knows what will happen in the upcoming seasons.Grade: ** out of ***** (due mainly to the Sharona incident)",2,"Oh, my Sharona...",1187740800,"08 22, 2007",2007,4453,"['Monk', 'addiction', 'character', 'wish', 'could', 'turn', 'off', 'instead', 'find', 'watching', 'beginning', 'end', 'because', 'episodes', 'are', 'formulaic', 'Adrian', 'Monk', 'appealing', 'troubles', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'let', 'do', 'what', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'late', 'wife', 'Trudy', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'had', 'opportunity', 'develop', 'bonds', 'had', 'chance', 'welcome', 'Adrian', 'homes', 'problems', 'embrace', 'kind', 'sensitive', 'detective', 'brought', 'laughter', 'side', 'brought', 'criminals', 'justice', 'would', 'be', 'utterly', 'frightened', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'take', 'bullet', 'friends', 'Stottlemeyer', 'Sharona', 'Monk', 'was', 'television', 'show', 'worked', 'simplicity', 'story', 'themes', 'was', ""n't"", 'disgusting', 'dark', 'C.S.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'wanted', 'Adrian', 'friends', 'continue', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'season', 'three', 'hoping', 'develop', 'more', 'what', 'happened', 'wife', 'instead', 'DISASTER', 'STRUCK.We', 'know', 'saying', 'Do', ""n't"", 'change', 'horses', 'mid-race', 'well', 'am', 'probably', 'not', 'first', 'attest', 'using', 'forum', 'television', 'series', 'Monk', 'did', 'subsequently', 'lost', 'devoted', 'viewer', 'way', 'Should', 'use', 'term', 'spoiler', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'must', 'warn', 'just', 'now', 'getting', 'series', 'Sharona', 'Fleming', 'midway', 'season', 'said', 'Do', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'destroyed', 'chances', 'season', 'four', 'make', 'player', 'least', 'three', 'months', 'need', 'time', 'cope', 'loss', 'truth', 'what', 'most', 'lost', 'Sharona', 'was', 'replaced', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'Adrian', 'Monk', ""n't"", 'respect', 'man', 'was', 'presented', 'two', 'whole', 'seasons', 'beginning', 'introduction', 'Ms.', 'Natalie', 'Teeger', 'hardest', 'change', 'Mr.', 'Monk', ""n't"", 'bad', 'realize', 'ready', 'anything', 'actress', 'portrayal', 'bitter', 'nagging', 'almost', 'point', 'violent', 'not', 'work', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Sharona', 'did', 'instead', 'decision', 'made', 'writers', 'feebly', 'attempt', 'define', 'humor', 'defining', 'season', 'feel', 'lost', 'friend', 'not', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'replaced', 'was', 'wiped', 'out', 'chance', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'was', 'pathetic', 'hurt.They', 'changed', 'theme', 'music', 'yet', 'quirkiness', 'show', 'can', 'continually', 'hear', 'background', 'whenever', 'needed', 'bring', 'back', 'essence', 'show', 'changed', 'Monk', 'therapist', 'managed', 'go', 'season', 'really', 'explaining', 'reason', 'wife', 'mysterious', 'death', 'yet', 'will', 'watch', 'fourth', 'season', 'will', 'mutter', 'breath', 'nasty', 'changes', 'yet', 'continue', 'view', 'episode', 'Why', 'love', 'character', 'Adrian', 'Monk', 'love', 'fact', 'building', 'amazing', 're-relationship', 'Captain', 'Stottlemeyer', 'One', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season', 'was', 'when', 'Stottlemeyer', 'were', 'Vegas', 'solving', 'murder', 'case', 'was', 'complete', 'epitome', 'what', 'show', 'amazing', 'Now', 'could', 'only', 'find', 'way', 'change', 'back', 'Sharona', 'think', 'unbeatable', 'mission.Overall', 'am', 'not', 'happy', 'season', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'seasons', 'realize', 'only', 'third', 'year', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'am', 'not', 'happy', 'big', 'changes', 'think', 'changes', 'make', 'fear', 'stability', 'show', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'bankable', 'show', 'going', 'back', 'even', 'when', 'surrounding', 'characters', 'make', 'look', 'grim', 'writing', 'seemed', 'better', 'season', 'mysterious', 'seemed', 'more', 'fun', 'developed', 'favorite', 'was', 'when', 'Monk', 'was', 'buried', 'visions', 'wife', 'were', 'very', 'comedic', 'scenes', 'am', 'going', 'try', 'allow', 'massive', 'changes', 'season', 'whisk', 'away', 'shoulders', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'promises', 'want', 'Sharona', 'back', 'could', 'shout', 'highest', 'mountain', 'would.As', 'time', 'season', 'three', 'least', 'favorite', 'season', 'loathe', 'character', 'named', 'Natalie', 'Teeger', 'can', 'be', 'patient', 'Who', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'upcoming', 'seasons.Grade', '**', '*****', 'due', 'mainly', 'Sharona', 'incident']",Monk: Season Three

900861,A27OGNBD5EKZ85,B00094AQZG,Arthur Liang,"[19, 29]","I first started watching Monk when the second season aired on TV, and from the first few minutes of the episode I was watching I could already tell that this was a show I was going to be watching for a long time!  I've never laughed more in my life.  Season three was even more fun than the first two.  It's true that this is the season where Bitty Schram's character Sharona leaves the show; while sad it hardly makes a difference.  Her replacement Traylor Howard, who plays Natalie Teeger, is not as comical a character as Sharona Fleming, but it is a minor thing.  The true focus of the show is Tony Shalhoub and his hilarious portrayal of Adrian Monk.  I myself suffered from a minor case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and while it was not as extreme as Monk's case I can still relate to the character in a way.  I have trouble understanding why people don't like this season as much as they do the others.  I suppose it would have to be that they disagree with my opinion about Bitty Schram's character.  I will admit she was a much more humorous character then Natalie Teeger's character, but my true appreciation for the show is Tony Shalhoub.  Bitty Schram, in my opinion, got too greedy.  She wanted more money and the show refused to pay more.  I will admit I was a little disappointed, but only a little. It seems that Schram's character was important to other fans of the show.  I also heard some exclaim that they were disappointed with the last episode in this season ""Mr. Monk and the Kid,"" which was something I could not understand at all.  As far as I'm concerned it was the best episode in the series.  Monk temporarily adopts a toddler of about 2 or 3 years and then in the end is forced to give him up.  It was so sad, but it was a great episode nevertheless.  I heard others say that they wanted the last episode to have something to do with Trudy's murder (Trudy is the departed wife of Adrian Monk).  They already did that on the last episode of Season 2 and frankly it would have been boring and redundant to do it again.  In summation if you want this season to be like the other two seasons then it is likely you won't enjoy Season 3, but if you are like me and you want to see ""Monk"" in a different way then I definitely recommend buying this.Here is a list of the Episodes From Season 3:01)Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan02)Mr. Monk and the Panic Room03)Mr. Monk and the Blackout04)Mr. Monk Gets Fired05)Mr. Monk Meets the Godfather06)Mr. Monk and the Girl Who Cried Wolf07)Mr. Monk and the Employee of the Month08)Mr. Monk and the Game Show09)Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine10)Mr. Monk and the Red Herring11)Mr. Monk V.S. the Cobra12)Mr. Monk Gets Cabin Fever13)Mr. Monk Gets Caught In Traffic14)Mr. Monk Goes to Vegas15)Mr. Monk and the Election16)Mr. Monk and the Kid",5,Best show on TV!,1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,2792,"['first', 'started', 'watching', 'Monk', 'when', 'second', 'season', 'aired', 'TV', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'episode', 'was', 'watching', 'could', 'already', 'tell', 'was', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'watching', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'never', 'laughed', 'more', 'life', 'Season', 'three', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'fun', 'first', 'two', 'true', 'season', 'where', 'Bitty', 'Schram', 'character', 'Sharona', 'show', 'sad', 'hardly', 'difference', 'replacement', 'Traylor', 'Howard', 'who', 'Natalie', 'Teeger', 'not', 'as', 'comical', 'character', 'Sharona', 'Fleming', 'minor', 'thing', 'true', 'focus', 'show', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'hilarious', 'portrayal', 'Adrian', 'Monk', 'suffered', 'minor', 'case', 'Obsessive', 'Compulsive', 'Disorder', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'extreme', 'Monk', 'case', 'can', 'still', 'relate', 'character', 'way', 'have', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'why', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'season', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'others', 'suppose', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'disagree', 'opinion', 'Bitty', 'Schram', 'character', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'humorous', 'character', 'then', 'Natalie', 'Teeger', 'character', 'true', 'appreciation', 'show', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'Bitty', 'Schram', 'opinion', 'got', 'too', 'greedy', 'wanted', 'more', 'money', 'show', 'refused', 'pay', 'more', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'only', 'little', 'Schram', 'character', 'was', 'important', 'other', 'fans', 'show', 'also', 'heard', 'exclaim', 'were', 'disappointed', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Kid', 'was', 'something', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'was', 'best', 'episode', 'series', 'Monk', 'temporarily', 'toddler', '2', '3', 'years', 'then', 'end', 'forced', 'give', 'up', 'was', 'so', 'sad', 'was', 'great', 'episode', 'nevertheless', 'heard', 'others', 'say', 'wanted', 'last', 'episode', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'Trudy', 'murder', 'Trudy', 'departed', 'wife', 'Adrian', 'Monk', 'already', 'did', 'last', 'episode', 'Season', '2', 'frankly', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'boring', 'redundant', 'do', 'again', 'summation', 'want', 'season', 'be', 'other', 'two', 'seasons', 'then', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'Season', '3', 'are', 'want', 'see', 'Monk', 'different', 'way', 'then', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'buying', 'list', 'Episodes', 'From', 'Season', '3:01', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Takes', 'Manhattan02', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Panic', 'Room03', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Blackout04', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Gets', 'Fired05', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Godfather06', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Cried', 'Wolf07', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Employee', 'Month08', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Game', 'Show09', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Takes', 'Medicine10', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Red', 'Herring11', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'V.S', 'Cobra12', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Gets', 'Cabin', 'Fever13', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Gets', 'Caught', 'Traffic14', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Goes', 'Vegas15', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Election16', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Kid']",Monk: Season Three
900862,AKHP38ZBW5DRK,B00094AQZG,Basil Khamis,"[13, 17]","Tony Shalhoub is a versatile actor who's been in the business for many years. His sitcom career spans from Antonio Scarpacci in Wings to Ian Stark in Stark Raving Mad before landing the much acclaimed title role of Monk. Prior to that he began acting in small roles in films such as ""Honeymoon In Vegas"", and with Bill Murray in ""Quick Change"". He also continued acting in films despite his TV roles, including ""Men In Black"", ""Siege"", ""I.Q."" and ""Galaxy Quest"" among others.In Monk Tony Shalhoub is former police detective Adrian Monk, whose photographic memory and amazing ability to piece together tiny clues made him a local legend.He suffers from intensified obsessive-compulsive disorder and a variety of phobias since the unsolved murder of his wife, Trudy, in 1997. Now on psychiatric leave from the San Francisco Police Department and working as a freelance detective/ consultant on difficult cases, Monk hopes to convince his former boss, Captain Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine), to allow him to return to the force. Stottlemeyer, who wavered between admiration for Monk and annoyance at his eccentricities during the first season, is becoming more of a friend to Monk as the series develops, frequently calling him in to help, as much for Monk's benefit as for his own. However, he knows Monk's limitations as well as his strengths and may still harbor doubts about the wisdom of allowing Monk to carry a gun or subdue a perpetrator. Stottlemeyer's second-in-command, Lieutenant Randall Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford), also seems to be developing both admiration and compassion for the man he once labeled ""the defective detective"".Despite flaws and inadequacies all around, the three are becoming an increasingly effective team, with additional help from Monk's personal assistant. From the double-episode pilot through the first half of season three, Monk was aided by his nurse, Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram). But in the tenth episode of the third season, Sharona was replaced by a new assistant, Natalie Teeger (Traylor Howard ex-star of Two Guys & A girl). Like Sharona, a divorcee with a son named Benjy, Natalie is a single parent, a widow with a daughter named Julie (Emmy Clarke). Unlike Sharona, Natalie is not a nurse but a former bartender with a fresh perspective on ""Mr. Monk,"" as she still addresses him.You can't help but compare it to Columbo but funnier. Its subtle comedy is more an undertone & with great writing both the humor as well as the suspense shine through.Verdict: Good third season although not as good as the first.  Traylor Howard is a refreshing change although time will tell how well suited she is for this role.Rating: 4 stars for overall season. Would have got 5 stars had we not had season one to compare it to.",4,Refreshing,1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,2761,"['Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'versatile', 'actor', 'who', 'been', 'business', 'many', 'years', 'sitcom', 'career', 'spans', 'Antonio', 'Scarpacci', 'Wings', 'Ian', 'Stark', 'Stark', 'Raving', 'Mad', 'landing', 'much', 'acclaimed', 'title', 'role', 'Monk', 'Prior', 'began', 'acting', 'small', 'roles', 'films', 'such', 'Honeymoon', 'Vegas', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Quick', 'Change', 'also', 'continued', 'acting', 'films', 'TV', 'roles', 'including', 'Men', 'Black', 'Siege', 'I.Q', 'Galaxy', 'Quest', 'others.In', 'Monk', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'former', 'police', 'detective', 'Adrian', 'Monk', 'photographic', 'memory', 'amazing', 'ability', 'piece', 'together', 'tiny', 'clues', 'made', 'local', 'legend.He', 'suffers', 'intensified', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'disorder', 'variety', 'phobias', 'unsolved', 'murder', 'wife', 'Trudy', '1997', 'Now', 'psychiatric', 'leave', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Police', 'Department', 'working', 'freelance', 'detective/', 'consultant', 'difficult', 'cases', 'Monk', 'convince', 'former', 'boss', 'Captain', 'Leland', 'Stottlemeyer', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'allow', 'return', 'force', 'Stottlemeyer', 'who', 'wavered', 'admiration', 'Monk', 'annoyance', 'eccentricities', 'first', 'season', 'becoming', 'more', 'friend', 'Monk', 'series', 'frequently', 'calling', 'help', 'much', 'Monk', 'benefit', 'own', 'However', 'Monk', 'limitations', 'as', 'well', 'strengths', 'may', 'still', 'harbor', 'doubts', 'wisdom', 'allowing', 'Monk', 'carry', 'gun', 'subdue', 'perpetrator', 'Stottlemeyer', 'second-in-command', 'Lieutenant', 'Randall', 'Disher', 'Jason', 'Gray-Stanford', 'also', 'be', 'developing', 'admiration', 'compassion', 'man', 'once', 'labeled', 'defective', 'detective', '.Despite', 'flaws', 'inadequacies', 'around', 'three', 'are', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'effective', 'team', 'additional', 'help', 'Monk', 'personal', 'assistant', 'double-episode', 'pilot', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'three', 'Monk', 'was', 'aided', 'nurse', 'Sharona', 'Fleming', 'Bitty', 'Schram', 'tenth', 'episode', 'third', 'season', 'Sharona', 'was', 'replaced', 'new', 'assistant', 'Natalie', 'Teeger', 'Traylor', 'Howard', 'ex-star', 'Two', 'Guys', 'A', 'girl', 'Sharona', 'divorcee', 'son', 'named', 'Benjy', 'Natalie', 'single', 'parent', 'widow', 'daughter', 'named', 'Julie', 'Emmy', 'Clarke', 'Sharona', 'Natalie', 'not', 'nurse', 'former', 'bartender', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'compare', 'Columbo', 'funnier', 'subtle', 'comedy', 'more', 'undertone', 'great', 'writing', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'suspense', 'shine', 'through.Verdict', 'Good', 'third', 'season', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'Traylor', 'Howard', 'refreshing', 'change', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'how', 'well', 'suited', 'role.Rating', '4', 'stars', 'overall', 'season', 'Would', 'have', 'got', '5', 'stars', 'had', 'not', 'had', 'season', 'one', 'compare']",Monk: Season Three

In a sense I think eventually they would had either change sherona character somewhat in season 4 or get rid of her all togehter. I mean it got to the point where not only was she taking care of him with all his phobias but, he felt like his protector as well.Natalie was totally different. She treated him like a man with probelms...instead of a little kid with probelms. However she is also a lot sweeter then sherona.Just to get to the episodes themsleves. Best episode easily is mr monk and the cobra. Truthfully didn't have that much hope for it but, got a Trudy clip at the end. IMO that episode alone is worth buying the boxset as it one of the sweetest moments in the show.we mr monk and the game show where it is a good mystery and we also get to meet trudy's parents and get to see some early monk. Mr. monk takes his medicine is also a very good episode. Finally as well the season finale was very touching. Mr monk and the kid. A very emotinal story when monk has to take care of a kid.

900866,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00094AQZG,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[45, 48]","One of the more clever television creations of the new millennium, Monk combines the high-grade suspense of a traditional TV drama with the quirky humor of a big screen comedy. Originally developed for ABC, the show became an instant prime-time lynchpin for the USA network, proving itself one of the more successful shows on cable TV...In Monk, Tony Shalhoub stars in the title role of Adrian Monk, a former San Francisco detective placed on psychiatric leave. A true legend in the community, Monk solves unsolvable crimes via his towering intellect, photographic memory, and meticulous observations. But the one case that alludes Monk is the 1997 murder of his wife Trudy, which forever altered Monk's capacity to perform his job. Suffering from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder and a number of odd phobias, Monk requires a personal assistant, Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram), for even his most basic daily activities. Yet Monk remains a police consultant on difficult cases, and he hopes to persuade Capt. Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) to give him his old job back. But Stottlemeyer and colleague Lt. Randall Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford), harbor doubts about Monk's mental faculties. As Monk solves cases though, those doubts dissipate and Stottlemeyer and Disher learn to appreciate Monk's special talents - despite his inability to cope with the day-to-day activities of a normal detective... Nevertheless, he remains a de facto investigator as he and Sharona aid the San Francisco police department in solving numerous high profile cases...The Monk (Season 3) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan"" in which Monk and company take a trip to New York City to investigate a lead on Trudy's murder given to Monk in the previous year's season finale. But while settling into their hotel, a riot breaks out in the lobby, and three people are killed, including the Latvian ambassador (who was just standing next to Monk). With Monk's identification of the killer's left ear being the only eye witness description of the perpetrator, the NYPD must rely on Monk's unique skills in order to solve the crime... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Mr. Monk Meets the Godfather"" in which Monk is pressured by a local mafia boss to help solve the murder of five of his henchmen, and ""Mr. Monk Gets Cabin Fever"" in which Monk witnesses a Chinese gangland murder, prompting the FBI to place him in the witness protection program - harboring him in a cabin out in the middle of nowhere...Below is a list of episodes included on the Monk (Season 3) DVD:Episode 30 (Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan)Episode 31 (Mr. Monk and the Panic Room)Episode 32 (Mr. Monk and the Blackout)Episode 33 (Mr. Monk Gets Fired)Episode 34 (Mr. Monk Meets the Godfather)Episode 35 (Mr. Monk and the Girl Who Cried Wolf)Episode 36 (Mr. Monk and the Employee of the Month)Episode 37 (Mr. Monk and the Game Show)Episode 38 (Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine)Episode 39 (Mr. Monk and the Red Herring)Episode 40 (Mr. Monk vs. the Cobra)Episode 41 (Mr. Monk Gets Cabin Fever)Episode 42 (Mr. Monk Gets Stuck in Traffic)Episode 43 (Mr. Monk Goes to Vegas)Episode 44 (Mr. Monk and the Election)Episode 45 (Mr. Monk and the Kid)The DVD Report",5,Hilarious & Interesting; One of the best shows on television...,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,3263,"['One', 'more', 'clever', 'television', 'creations', 'new', 'millennium', 'Monk', 'high-grade', 'suspense', 'traditional', 'TV', 'drama', 'quirky', 'humor', 'big', 'screen', 'comedy', 'Originally', 'developed', 'ABC', 'show', 'became', 'instant', 'prime-time', 'lynchpin', 'USA', 'network', 'proving', 'one', 'more', 'successful', 'shows', 'cable', 'TV', 'Monk', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'stars', 'title', 'role', 'Adrian', 'Monk', 'former', 'San', 'Francisco', 'detective', 'placed', 'psychiatric', 'leave', 'true', 'legend', 'community', 'Monk', 'unsolvable', 'crimes', 'towering', 'intellect', 'photographic', 'memory', 'meticulous', 'observations', 'one', 'case', 'Monk', '1997', 'murder', 'wife', 'Trudy', 'forever', 'altered', 'Monk', 'capacity', 'perform', 'job', 'Suffering', 'severe', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'disorder', 'number', 'odd', 'phobias', 'Monk', 'personal', 'assistant', 'Sharona', 'Fleming', 'Bitty', 'Schram', 'even', 'most', 'basic', 'daily', 'activities', 'Monk', 'police', 'consultant', 'difficult', 'cases', 'persuade', 'Capt', 'Leland', 'Stottlemeyer', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'give', 'old', 'job', 'back', 'Stottlemeyer', 'colleague', 'Lt.', 'Randall', 'Disher', 'Jason', 'Gray-Stanford', 'harbor', 'doubts', 'Monk', 'mental', 'faculties', 'Monk', 'cases', 'doubts', 'dissipate', 'Stottlemeyer', 'Disher', 'learn', 'appreciate', 'Monk', 'special', 'talents', 'inability', 'cope', 'day-to-day', 'activities', 'normal', 'detective', 'Nevertheless', 'de', 'facto', 'investigator', 'Sharona', 'aid', 'San', 'Francisco', 'police', 'department', 'solving', 'numerous', 'high', 'profile', 'cases', 'Monk', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Takes', 'Manhattan', 'Monk', 'company', 'take', 'trip', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'investigate', 'lead', 'Trudy', 'murder', 'given', 'Monk', 'previous', 'year', 'season', 'finale', 'settling', 'hotel', 'riot', 'out', 'lobby', 'three', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'including', 'Latvian', 'ambassador', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'standing', 'next', 'Monk', 'Monk', 'identification', 'killer', 'left', 'ear', 'being', 'only', 'eye', 'witness', 'description', 'perpetrator', 'NYPD', 'must', 'rely', 'Monk', 'unique', 'skills', 'order', 'solve', 'crime', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', 'include', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Godfather', 'Monk', 'pressured', 'local', 'mafia', 'boss', 'help', 'solve', 'murder', 'five', 'henchmen', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Gets', 'Cabin', 'Fever', 'Monk', 'Chinese', 'gangland', 'murder', 'prompting', 'FBI', 'place', 'witness', 'protection', 'program', 'harboring', 'cabin', 'out', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Monk', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'Episode', '30', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Takes', 'Manhattan', 'Episode', '31', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Panic', 'Room', 'Episode', '32', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Blackout', 'Episode', '33', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Gets', 'Fired', 'Episode', '34', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Godfather', 'Episode', '35', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Cried', 'Wolf', 'Episode', '36', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Employee', 'Month', 'Episode', '37', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Game', 'Show', 'Episode', '38', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Takes', 'Medicine', 'Episode', '39', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Red', 'Herring', 'Episode', '40', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Cobra', 'Episode', '41', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Gets', 'Cabin', 'Fever', 'Episode', '42', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Gets', 'Stuck', 'Traffic', 'Episode', '43', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Goes', 'Vegas', 'Episode', '44', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Election', 'Episode', '45', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Kid', 'DVD', 'Report']",Monk: Season Three

There's no need for me to praise Tony Shalhoub because the other reviewers (and his three well-deserved Emmy Awards) have already made that case more convincingly than I could. I'll just add, though, that Ted Levine and Jason Gray-Stanford are both outstanding in their supporting roles, particularly when they're interacting with one another.Since so many people have weighed in on the subject of Sharona vs. Natalie I guess I will too. Personally I found Sharona's ""Joisey"" accent grating and her character obnoxious and overbearing. Sharona frequently criticized Monk and made snide comments to him, not to mention quitting her job twice within the first six episodes of season one alone. I'm not sure what part of this behavior it was that appealed so some people but personally I consider Sharona's departure to be a positive and it certainly doesn't seem to have hurt the show's popularity overall.Natalie, on the other hand, is a much nicer character but manages to do so without being a pushover or a bland Watson-like sidekick. She's kind and supportive to the fragile Monk but also sets boundaries on what she's willing to tolerate; in other words, she manages to be strong without being annoying.

The seasons starts in New York as the regular cast follows up a clue about the death of Monk's wife Trudy.  But soon they're back to San Francisco and dealing with killer monkeys, power failures, the mob, traffic, Vegas, and a new assistant.Just over the halfway point, Bitty Schram, who played Monk's assistant Sharona, was asked to leave the show over a salary dispute.  As with any cast change, this one has it's own share of controversy.  I was afraid this would ruin my favorite series, but I felt it made it stronger.  Natalie is a strong character.  In fact, her introduction episode is easily my favorite of this season.  While she shares much with Sharona, she doesn't treat Monk with kid gloves but expects him to behave somewhat like an adult.  Even more importantly, it forced the writers to once again focus on good character interactions and stories.  I feel the first half of the season was slipping into caricature.  The cast change forced them to refocus their efforts; it proved to be a breath of fresh air that the show needed.So what do you get with this set?  The sixteen episodes are presented in wide screen and Dolby sound on four discs.  Each disc also contains at least one mini extra segment.  There are five this time around.  Members of the cast and crew talk about favorite scenes; we finally get a profile of Monk as well as Natalie; Tony Shalhoub, Ted Levine, and Jason Gray-Stanford talk about the back story of their characters (we learn nothing new about Monk, but we do about the other two); and the series creator talks a little bit about Monk's quirks.

I am also a huge fan of Bitty Schram and the dynamics that she brought out in her character Sharona.  Season three is compiled of the last episodes with Bitty Schram and the introduction of replacement for Schram with Traylor Howard.  I suggest that if you have seen an episode with Bitty Schram you should watch seasons one and two before seeing the new episodes with Traylor Howard.  I am very dissapointed with the departure of Schram and the new turn of the series.  I am although a devoted fan of Tony Shalhoub and Monk.  Some of the crafty writing and strong character relationships that helped to develop the show have slipped with the departure of Schram.  I continue to watch the series and hope the character chemistry and strong storylines will be revived or perhaps Schram will be invited back.  I must also give praise to other characters that help carry the show.

Sharona fulfills her role as the ""Watson"" character in a way that is beyond good.Trivial, but noticeable: I do wish some reviewers would get this right ... Monk solves way more than one case a show, in fact usually several, so its not just a matter of a new season and ""16 more cases to solve"", in fact it is closer to double that amount, easily.Sharona just disappears ""Mid-Season"", and The so-called  Sharona  clone, Natalie, is introduced. Well, she is not, officially, a Sharona  clone. Yes she is a new assistant, but look at the specials on disk 3.The Special  Feature LIFE BEFORE  MONK is actually at odds with the NATALIE  TEEGER PROFILE, where Tony says ( wether for the official  Studio line, or ?? ) that the change to Natalie is to basically cut loose Monk and see if/how he grows. Well, check out the two special  features on disc 3, the two are incompatible as views on the same  situation.From Shows 1-9 in the third series, Sharona Helps Monk, Motivates Monk, and pushes him on to do more; Sharona is the emotional, and plot catalyst in many ways ( she  rips the Hair piece off the Commisioner, and thus helps solve the case).In the Shows 10-16, Teeger is a fifth wheel, does less than Sharona, and is superbly vacuous. One scene has Monk asking why she is doing something and ""Natalie"" says "" I can do anything I want, I'm cute..."".In one great episode, Mako ( as Master Zee) makes some observations that resonate so well, and in a manner that only Mako, a superb character player, can deliver.I don't want to say which scenes are the best emotionally, but when Monk/Adrian, gets to play essentially on his own, Monk is superbly emotional and emotive.If they can find a way to restore Sharona, then this will restore the original Successful Formula.Also,the Box is of a high Quality than previous boxes; contrary to some comments, the smaller plastic covers are better than the foldouts in Seasons  1 and 2 because they are more  robust. I have bought enough of the Digipack foldouts to know, and to be able to recommend that the Individual  Disc  Covers are Superb.I honestly hope that this is not the last Major Season of Monk, but maybe, like so many great shows, three seasons is the limit; however, some superb shows can last 8 seasons with great writing. In my view, the core writing idea is great, what you need is maybe some fresh views on a timeless plot structure, not a change to a vacuous assistant that allows the lead to show his skills.
