I am usually cautious when buying a ""Gay"" themed movie especially when it's not produced or backed by a much bigger budget studio. However for some unknown reason to me (I'll claim insanity here) I was possessed to go out and buy this movie before trying to find a video store that may have had it to rent. Oh well I guess ya live and learn. The only half decent acting in this movie was done by an actor who plays the straight brother of the leading male character. A host of bad things crop up in this movie i.e.; Bad, actors, bad script, bad camera angles, bad cameraman, bad lighting, bad dialogue. The only good thing about the movie is the natural beauty of the surrounding backdrop in whatever town they shot it at.

Gay cinema is a little hard to take at times because a lot of the films are cheesy and low budget.  This is a low budget flick.

Aaron Burr could use some acting lessons but he is still likeable as the insecure and confused Drew who takes Mark (Matthew MOntgomery) in and falls in love with him.

I wished I have had my initial viewing of this film at the theatre. This flick is definitely one of the better gay romance movies to come out over the past few years that can be appreciated by both gay and straight audiences. If Michael Akers can do this remarkable, credible, and satisifying a project on his limited budget for this film, I can't wait to see what he will do when the ""bank vaults are open."" The dialogue and scenes do jump awkwardly a bit from time to time, but nothing that detracts or cheapens the overall quality of this film. No, this is not a ""Meryl Streep- Oscar-worthy"" movie. If it were, the true power of this flick would have been lost.This likeable cast has a great chemistry together, which added to my enjoyment of the film. What is all the more amazing is that this was the movie debut of all the actors. Aaron Orr (Drew Parker) put forth a wonderful and credible effort of making me laugh, making me cry, and bonding me to his character as few actors have over the past few years. My big surprise was the supporting role of Ariadne Shaffer as Catherine Reeves. I thought I was in a ""time warp"" watching Kathleen Turner 20 years ago! Matthew Montgomery (Mark Reeves) put in a great effort of creating the sensitive, confused amnesia victim and expressing to the audience Mark's coming to terms with his sexuality and who he really loves. Bravo Aaron, Ariadne, and Matthew! We will be all the better seeing these upcoming actors in future projects over the next few years.The chemistry and bond between Drew and Mark was very evident throughout their scenes together and the main reason this film doesn't disappoint. The love scene between the two main characters goes beyond the typical Hollywood ""sanitized"" scenes, but is tastefully and affectionately done.Michael Akers' first film is a recommend ""must-see"" for all romantics out there. It is not a surprise this film was the official selection at almost a dozen or so showings around the 2003 festival circut. With the just the right balance of humor, happy, hope, sad, and serious, this film gets better and more satisifying to me upon each viewing.

Yeh, it's kind of a low rating, but please know that I didn't hate this film... let's be fair and say it had some good points, lots of bad points, and many points in between.  Let's also be fair and say that those who gave the film five stars didn't look very far beyond its emotional value, and those who gave it one didn't look beyond its lack of technical polish.The truth is that ""Gone, But Not Forgotten"" has both.  It's another in a string of independent films that wants to tell an earnest gay romance but gets bogged down by a lack of money, experience and talent.This film was undoubtedly put together on a shoestring budget, and it really shows.  The soundtrack is unbearable at points, and there are a few editing and film stock shifts (especially the swimming scene where the lake and background suddenly turn yellow) that are jarring.  There's no arguing that this is an amateur movie with some truly painful technical moments.That said, the story is engaging enough and most of the acting is at least ok.  As much as I didn't care for Aaron Orr as park ranger Drew (his delivery just struck me as odd throughout the film), I did like Matthew Montgomery as Mark, who has the thankless task of taking on the world's hoariest plot device (amnesia) and making it seem plausible.I have to add that, story-wise, I was really uncomfortable with how agressively Drew pursues the amnesiac Mark.  At the climax of the film, we find out that there's a reason for this pursuit, but it didn't remedy the fact that Drew gave me the creeps beforehand.In the end, this film compares directly with ""Big Eden""... both have a mountain/forest setting and are centered on a ""will they or won't they"" story line.  Yes, in ""Gone, But Not Forgotten"", the leads are hunkier and there is the tender love-making scene that's missing from ""Big Eden"".

This plays like a first draft of a screenplay which fails to effectively expand on a good basic story. With better writing and more nuanced direction, even the shot-on-digital-video imagery would have worked. Matthew Montgomery is very effective, hampered as he is with the poor dialog written for his otherwise interesting character. I wanted a better movie for him to play in, since he tried very hard to convey the confusion and inner turmoil that Mark was going through. In this instance the fragmented flashback technique was used to good effect in helping the audience see the emerging story. Unfortunately, Aaron Orr, though he looked the part, is not a strong enough actor to match Montgomery's performance. His portrayal of the lonely, haunted Forest Ranger fell so far short of the mark that he actually bogged down the action and left me alternately confused and exasperated as I tried to figure out just what his character was really feeling. A stronger actor in this central role, again in spite of the weak dialog, would have elevated this film and made the whole viewing experience much more satisfying. The Writer/Director, Michael Akers, needs to hone his writing skills and take a cue from other, better films when attempting to build dramatic tension and craft scenes which touch the audiences emotions, which certainly could have been achieved with a story this good. Yes, this is a good Gay-Themed story and we need more films which promote a positive image for gays in these troubled times, but...they need to be WELL MADE films as well.

We see Drew a forest ranger who rescues Mark from jumping off a cliff. When in the hospital they ask him his name and he can't remember. Obviously he is suffering from amnesia. From the beginning we see that Drew is very attractive to Mark.(The body language says it all and innuendoes) When Mark seems to be getting better Drew offers to take him home and try to help him remember by taking him canoeing, cooking with him little helpful things. During the film we see little flash backs of his experience on the cliff. (Nothing important until the love scene and when he gets his memory back)come on you knew it was gonna happen O-O. While sitting on the couch one night Mark and Drew have an important conversation about what really happened this is after they've been having sex. Drew tells him that Mark said ""Tell her im sorry."" After a fight in the car Drew find that Mark is missing. Returning to the hospital we find out that Mark has a wife and went back home. From watching how she acts around him there is something wrong. We see him looking confused and she has to explain things to him.(She doesnt seem to be very happy about it either) Certain things have changes as well they use to both drink martinies but now Mark seems to hate them. As the story unfolds Mark asks the clincher question ""Are we always like this"" meaning are we always this unhappy. From that question we find out what really happened. Marks wife had him followed and he has been meeting MEN at hotels and having sex with them. His memory finally returns and he makes the decision to go back to Drew. What a happy ending hurray. This movie is a little boring in some parts but like i said before it is good for a first try. The acting is well the say bad but the story is a genuine one. This isnt a collectors item but for anyone who is interested in gay films should try to see this movie just for the experience. The love scene in the movie isnt extreme like a hot porn which is a good thing if you want to watch something sweet and cute.

I had to turn this off and force myself back to it several times as that was how bad the acting and production was (even the doctor writing a prescription or pouring water looked and sounded blatantly fake). And as bad as the production and acting was it was nothing compared to conflicts between some of the characters that made little sense whatsoever. The only kudos I can give is the overall premise and story was acceptable, although drawn out way too long, and the relationships could have be incredibly fulfilling but the senselessness really hurt it so only the main interactions could be called even sweet if one can bear through the glaring flaws of this film.So some congrats to the writer and main actors for at least being able to get that across regardless of the faults but a big thumbs down for the entirely unnecessary and pretentious setup for the brief attack on Christianity from both gay main and Christian wife in the film that went beyond the character. Don't get me wrong a character can have any beliefs but the ""story"" should not be religiously intolerant. On the other hand a thank you for partially making up for that by suggesting the main gay character goes towards Christianity / God and his family though that could have been demonstrated stronger by the family inviting to church with them rather than just invited to dinner IF that was what was intended.If you can bear such faults then may be worth a watch, I recommend rent first.

Why? Because the two leads (Aaron Orr and Matthew Montgomery). They quietly sizzle together. And that's what this movie is about to me, their chemistry, it's natural, not forced, not over-acted.The plot isn't new, but still who doesn't love a good amnesiac story in a romance movie? Mark (Montgomery) is found after a fall suffering from amnesia and rescued by Drew (Orr), a Park Ranger. Drew feels an instant connection to Mark, but Mark isn't sure of his own confused feelings. But their friendship as they grow to know each other develops into something more intense and that's when Mark's past comes back to shatter their new found happiness.Yes, the plotline of this film could come out of any Harlequin Romance novel, however, what this film has that a Harlequin Romance novel doesn't is a talented cast and a superbly directed script.

There was never a moment during the film where I believed that these actors were anything but...actors.  They were raw and robotic and forced not only lines, but emotions and gestures.  The story had much promise...it was void of the trappings of urban life, the stereotypes and drugs and alcohol and all the other vices associated with the urban gay lifestyle.  And...it was not a trite premise in any way...it was unique and interesting.  But the unique and interesting premise never developed into a unique and interesting story.  It was rushed.  The relationships were unclear or lacking in poignancy.  The ending was not satisfying.  I didn't care enough about any of them to be happy with the ending.  When I watch a film or read a book, I invest my time, and sometimes my heart, in the good ones.  I felt nothing when I pressed the stop button on my DVD player.

There are new faces: Aaron Orr, Matthew Montgomery, and some more familiar faces: Bryna Weiss, Joel Bryant, Brenda Lasker, Ariadne Shaffer. The acting from all is brilliant and their portrayal of their characters is absolutely believable. There's none of the attitude and arrogance that so often marks and mars the performance of Hollywood's chosen few.I was especially impressed with Aaron Orr who was absolutely natural and never missed a beat in his role as one of the two central characters. Matthew Montgomery seemed a bit forced early on, but came into his own and gave a sterling performance overall. Watch the film once, then watch it again and look more closely at the eyes of the two as they interact.The rest of the cast play their roles with flair, and give a depth to their characters that becomes more apparent with each viewing (this is a move you will want to watch again and again).The film goes places that Hollywood has apparently forgotten how to go. Whether you're gay, straight, or anything in between (even Druids will find something to be enthused about in this movie ;-), you'll find yourself emotionally involved with the characters and wishing the film didn't have to end. If you've got one spark of romance in your soul, this movie will set it to blazing (to paraphrase Granny Clampett speaking about her Spring Tonic).Michael Akers and Sandon Berg can be proud to have created one of the finest movies that, in my humble opinion, has ever been made.Watch it, and prepare to be entertained, kept on the edge of your seat, compelled to identify with at least one character in the film, and most importantly, to smile. If your faith in humanity has been eroded by watching the world unfold around you in recent years, you'll come away from this film with the conviction that there may be some hope after all.The musical score is worth the price of the movie, by itself.

But the execution is amateurish beyond belief.Drew Parker (Aaron Orr), a forest ranger rescues Mark (Montgomery) a young man injured in a fall.  Mark is suffering from amnesia.  He moves in with Drew, and as his memory slowly returns, the two men begin a passionate love affair.Granted, this is a low-budget movie, but the production values are absolutely bottom-of-the-barrel.  There are numerous continuity lapses.  The script is poorly written, filled with stilted dialogue.  A better cast might have made something of the shoddy material, but most of the actors are so bad it is painful to watch them.  Orr is particularly dreadful as Drew, definitely not a leading man.  Ariadne Shaffer is appalling as Mark's bitchy wife.  Montgomery is rather sweet, and he does a decent enough job in his first full-length role.  Joel Bryant gives the best performance in the cast, as Drew's brother and boss.Aside from Montgomery and Bryant, there really isn't much to recommend this movie.

These 2 are truly likable characters.

But sometimes low budget simply means that the honesty and the true meaning of the story get to be front and center.  That is the case with Gone But Not Forgotten.The acting is simple and natural...meaning, the actors don't over do it.  Real people aren't actors and these actors portray the characters as real people, not Hollywood idols. But this is not to say the acting in not powerful, because it is.  Matthew Montgomery's scene with Aaron Orr in the livingroom where Mark's character asks Drew to tell him about the rescue is riveting.  Montgomery's acting skills are right on the money.There is a soap opera-like quality to the storyline and trust me that's not a bad thing. But one can't argue with the accomplishments of this movie.  The lovemaking scene is incredible in its sensativity and its honest credibility.  This is a perfect depiction of love in my opinion.Gone, But Not Forgotten is one of those films that is better than the sum of its parts.  When one reads about the elements of the story, it sounds like a daytime soap and as I said, that's not a bad thing. However, some may end up believing this movie isn't a great movie, but it is.
