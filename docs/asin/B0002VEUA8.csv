846548,A2I16SKF3RHED6,B0002VEUA8,B5Anteros,"[30, 32]","Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Tinto Brass. If you don't know who he is then you don't know where his tendencies lie when it comes to women. Well, let me tell you.Mr. Brass likes his women earthy and hairy. He is the master of the tease shot. In all his movies he teases the (mostly) male viwer with shots of scantilly clad female crotches, usually with pubic hair prominently displayed. He also likes to have at least one shot of a woman peeing in his films. This film does not disappoint. For American men Tinto Brass is probably an aquired taste. There's the masterbation scene, for example, where before she starts, Lola sniffs both her hairy armpits. Most men here would find that gross but I thought it was extremely erotic.Before I watched this film my favorite Brass film was ""Cheeky"" (not it's original name) which I watched while living in England. ( I wish they would release it in America.) But this one is by far the best one of them all.Lola truly is the flirt that lives within all women. You and I have met, and been bowled over by,  women like this. The lead actress is absolutely beautiful, fun, sexy... you name it, she has it.If this review has intrigued you and not grossed you out, I urge you to inspect the works of Tinto Brass. He is simply the best director of erotic works in the world.",5,I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.,1145664000,"04 22, 2006",2006,1328,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Tinto', 'Brass', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'tendencies', 'lie', 'when', 'women', 'Well', 'let', 'tell', 'you.Mr', 'Brass', 'women', 'earthy', 'hairy', 'master', 'tease', 'shot', 'movies', 'mostly', 'male', 'viwer', 'shots', 'scantilly', 'clad', 'female', 'crotches', 'usually', 'pubic', 'hair', 'prominently', 'displayed', 'also', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'shot', 'woman', 'peeing', 'films', 'film', 'not', 'disappoint', 'American', 'men', 'Tinto', 'Brass', 'probably', 'aquired', 'taste', 'masterbation', 'scene', 'example', 'where', 'Lola', 'hairy', 'armpits', 'Most', 'men', 'here', 'would', 'find', 'gross', 'thought', 'was', 'extremely', 'erotic.Before', 'watched', 'film', 'favorite', 'Brass', 'film', 'was', 'Cheeky', 'not', 'original', 'name', 'watched', 'living', 'England', 'wish', 'would', 'release', 'America', 'one', 'far', 'best', 'one', 'all.Lola', 'truly', 'flirt', 'women', 'have', 'met', 'been', 'bowled', 'women', 'lead', 'actress', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'fun', 'sexy', 'name', 'it.If', 'review', 'intrigued', 'not', 'grossed', 'urge', 'inspect', 'works', 'Tinto', 'Brass', 'simply', 'best', 'director', 'erotic', 'works', 'world']",N/A

846550,A2ZKEBPCKEHDGL,B0002VEUA8,C McGhee,"[3, 4]","This movie has one of the great beginning scenes in cinema, fun, flirty, sexy & naughty.It's about role reversal in which a young bride to be wants intercourse with her hubby to be before the marriage & the groom to be doesn't want to spoil their honeymoon. Unfortunately it starts to die shortly thereafter.Tinto Brass of Caligula & Salon Kitty fame (Monamour for those of more modern times) has put together a film centered around the joy of life if you believe the advertising but it's more about the joy of lips. That OK by me but the sheer number of times that you're subject to shots of her asset, especially from behind is staggering, so much so, that the movie becomes trite & boring.You see her in g-strings & peoples fingers under the g-strings & her fingers under the g-strings & then no g-strings & camera angles, fingers, pube pulling as her desire for sex drives her & everyone else crazy for some of her legmeet. This includes her father or is it step-father.Everyone thinks it cute as she goes all over town with her naked crotch showing. Her future husband to be is played by a stupid wimp that believes she is to be valued as she is & everything will be fine after marriage. Guess I'm not Italian enough. The film's motto, which I take from the film, is summed up in the lines ""There are three things in the world which leave no trace. A bird high in the sky, a fish deep in the sea & a crock(sp) inside a prussy(sp).This could have been a good movie because it does have a joyous atmosphere but the camera is so overly focused on her crotch that I got tired of seeing it. That's saying something too as she is beautiful, flirtatious & constantly grinning. Girls take note; it's not so much the open legs as it is the open legs with a grin on the face. That communication that you're having fun too is contagious. I had thought I'd watch this with my wife but seeing as how she likes men I doubt she'll really enjoy it. I mean if it's too much prussy(sp) for me it likely will be too much for her.A movie killed by not enough variation in what is on the screen. I felt like I had seen this girl's liver by the end of the show. I'll give it 2.5 stars because of the dynamite beginning. What a waste that was. I guess I could try it on my wife but I don't think I could stand it again. One look at the first five minutes is highly recommended then turn it off. I guess that's the way to go with my wife, first five then muff dive.OK, I watched it with my wife & we laughed our heads off the first few minutes. The slide to confused & yawning set in pretty quick. She does agree the first min's are hilarious, flirtatious & sexy. The music through there is perfect too. A real joy to watch.I may try & find a really used copy cheap & keep it just for that. The story is far worse than it needed to be. The story could of worked, it just doesn't. Maybe I need to be 16 again to enjoy it.

Lola (Anna Ammirati) wants to experience sex. Her puritanical boyfriend, Masetto (Mario Parodi), does not. He wants her chaste until their wedding. But Lola is so achingly beautiful and gaminely charming that even celibate priests can't help looking twice and staring in rapt adoration. Ordinary mortals lust for her in much more sinful ways. So it comes as no surprise that Lola gets her wish. The film is a zesty celebration of life. It leaves you feeling refreshed, happy and puts a smile on your face for the rest of the day. It is NOT porn. It is Italian erotic comedy at its finest. It is sad that many viewers today cannot see the beauty of such films anymore, films that celebrate the beauty of the female form, the joys of sex, and ultimately, the simple fact of being alive.Anna Ammirati is absolutely gorgeous as the winsome and irrepressible Lola. The camera cannot get enough of her. There is no explicit sex here, but there is plenty of full frontal nudity and Tinto Brass' trademark fetish for round female bottoms, hairy bushes, and the obligatory shot of his heroine peeing. If this disturbs you, then you should stay away.The 1950s-influenced soundtrack contributes much to the happy feel of this film. From the upbeat title track, ""Mona Monella,"" sung by Anna Ammirati herself (during the bicycling sequence and the end credits) to the half dozen other gems, including the infectious and very danceable ""Mambo Italiano,"" to American classics like ""Be Bop A Lula,"" ""Let's Twist Again"" and ""In the Mood,"" the songs breathe with the sunny nature of this happy film.Unfortunately this ""Special Edition"" DVD from Cult Epics is a disappointment. It is presented in its entirety, finally uncut and in its orignal theatrical aspect ratio of 1.66:1. However it comes without anamorphic enhancement (not enhanced for widescreen TV). But what is so unforgivable about this edition is how poor the picture actually looks. It doesn't look at all like it was made in 1998. It looks more like a half-hearted transfer of a film from the early 70s. Colors are lacklustre, especially so in exterior shots where they appear washed out. Picture is soft and grainy, partly due to the director's use of soft-focus but also in large part due to the transfer. A lot of the exteriors (and some interiors) look like they were shot through a perpetual soft haze. A very poor effort by Cult Epics. Thankfully, Cult Epics has provided the original Italian Dolby Stereo track which sounds surprisingly good, especially in the music sequences. Optional English subtitles are also provided. This is a treasurable film and it deserves to be properly remastered.",4,Delightful celebration of life...

I know it tries to be a dramatic and artsy movie, but it felt like they used this guise to film a softcore porn.  I mean, I don't mind naked women, but this movie just felt overly forced.  Not to mention the character development and interaction was quite boring.Basically Lola is engaged to some young bread maker named Matasso.  She spends a good portion of the film trying to get him to sleep with her.  Her ""father"" Andre also appears to be some kind of risqu&eacute; photographer that also takes liberties with the women he photographs.  The film has a lot to do with voyeurism in concept and I suspect that is kind of the target audience.  If you're into that, then you'll definitely love this because the way certain scenes are filmed it's as if you're ""snooping"" in on Lola, rather than watching the movie.  Either way you look at it, this is a highly sexually charged movie.  If that's what you're looking for, go for it.  I have nothing against people making this stuff or watching it, it just wasn't my thing.  If the background story was at least interesting to me, I would have liked this much more, but I got fairly bored with the tale.  I think my problem lies in the fact that I didn't think the story was the focus of the film; rather Lola being topless was much more important.  I mean, I can see that kind of stuff for free and not on TV, so when I sit down to watch a video I want something more to draw me in.  This failed to do that.Either way you look at it, I'm not going to enjoy this kind of a movie.  I just thought I would let anyone else know about what this is like, because the way it's advertised does seem kind of interesting.  This just didn't live up to the way the film was advertised at all on here and I think that's where it lost me.

Rumor has it that the inscrutable producer of erotica met the vivacious young actress, Anna Ammirati while examining her body. The body of her car that is, after being involved in a traffic accident with her. It doesn't matter whose fault it was, the outcome was inevitable - Anna gallivanting around with little or no clothing in his next movie. Anna is reputed to have entreated the enigmatic director to feature her in his next movie and a enchanting match was born.The PlotLola is a carefree lass in an unnamed village in Italy of some notoriety and gossip. Her mother who grew up there, left years before but returned with a handsome paramour, Andr'e and a vibrant sexually precocious teen daughter, Lola.Lola is a virgin a condition she dislikes. She is engaged to the son of the village baker, Masetto, whom she wants to deflower her. Masetto would like to wait for their wedding night and this frustrates Lola.A sub plot of the movie is Lola's relationship with her alleged father, Andr'e. They both find each other and find each other attractive.The StoryThe story revolves around Lola's efforts to get Masetto to make love with her and thus take her virginity. She tries various tricks, including making him jealous by coming on with other men. There was even a scene in a tavern where she is jitterbugging with three soldiers, sans her panties, with flashes of her genital folds and pubis.Lola's alleged father Andr'e fascinates her. He is somewhat of a leach with prurient instincts and she is drawn to and fanaticizes about him. She makes a couple unsuccessful attempts to seduce him.In the end Lola does trick Masetto into deflowering her - her term and at their wedding the next day a scene takes place between Lola and Andr'e where you are left wondering, no believing that they also have sex.In hindsight it may be a take on that old song of the fifties, ""Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets.""ConclusionLola is indeed frivolous and afew other adjectives ranging from adorable to bratty. Her self-centered thoughtless behavior is nothing short of tawdry. If there are women that behave so flippant, I wouldn't want to be engaged to them. Yet, as a viewer there is something winsome about her frolicsome, lighthearted, even compelling behavior.As with other Brass movies I have viewed a typical theme permeates Frivolous Lola. Nothing is shameful to her. She with the overactive libido was born to enjoy life and she resents anyone that wants to rein her in, while her man is supposed to go along with her indiscretionsFrivolous Lola is an exercise in exhibitionism. The movie seems to be a memorial to Lola's or is it Anna Amirati's shapely figure with voyeuristic peeks at her genitalia. The story seems incidental, it is merely a vehicle to attain the desired effect.I do not mean to sound like this is bad. Contrary, it is good. I found the movie to be funny entertaining and stimulating - one of his best and one of the better erotica movies available.The lovely Anna Amirati was uniformly naughty and loveable. Her body was adorable and her acting endearing. Supporting actors, Packtrick Mower and Mario Parodi did well too.The film was shot in what appeared to be the Italian countryside. The sets and costumes were colorful and the cinematography was first rate.

846564,A2MF0N72JVXDAP,B0002VEUA8,The Phantom,"[0, 0]","If you've ever seen a Brass movie, you know what to expect with &#34;Frivolous Lola.&#34; If you haven't, here's what you get:&#8226;Attractive leading woman who is silly, loves to toy around with men, gets naked almost constantly, enjoys exposing her butt (and vagina, to a lesser extent) and has hairy armpits (gross).&#8226;Bodily function, including but not limited to urination and hymen destruction.&#8226;Occasional male genitalia, some real and some fake.&#8226;Nude modeling (and photographers who shoot nude models).&#8226;Baked goods.What I'm saying with all of this is that Brass' work is highly formulaic, which is not to say that it's bad. It's just that I don't care much for the formula. Brass isn't content with beautiful women's being beautiful; he has to present them in situations that make them as ugly as possible. Which, OK, if these were French art house movies, fine, but they aren't--they are labeled as erotica, which means that the point is to try to turn viewers on. I can't imagine who in the hell would get turned on by seeing a woman wiping herself, or a man's sniffing her butt, or a gratuitous shot of the blood left behind following a virginal deflowering.But then again I'm a heterosexual American male, and I also don't want to see women with underarm hair. Unfortunately that's routine for Brass' movies.Concerning &#34;Frivolous Lola&#34; in particular, the good thing is that we get a metric ton of full frontal from leading lady Anna Ammarati, who plays a young virgin who is in sexual overdrive. Engaged to be married, it would appear that all that she really wants is for her fiance to &#34;stop respecting&#34; her and take her virginity before the wedding (he refuses, over and over again). However he's totally OK with hammering a breathtakingly-hot hooker--wish that she'd had more screen time.The good basically ends there. This one's even more uncomfortable to watch than some other Brass films, because of the complex nature of the relationship between the lead character and her--father? We don't ever really know for certain if it's actually her father, or just the man who thinks that he is her father because of the relationship that he had with her mother. At any rate the sexual tension there is pretty disgusting.If you're looking for hot naked women, there are better places to look--even from Brass.",3,Pretty typical for Brass,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,2358,"[""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Brass', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'expect', '34', 'Frivolous', 'Lola.', '34', 'have', ""n't"", 'here', 'what', 'get', '8226', 'Attractive', 'leading', 'woman', 'who', 'silly', 'toy', 'men', 'naked', 'almost', 'constantly', 'exposing', 'butt', 'vagina', 'lesser', 'extent', 'hairy', 'armpits', 'gross', '8226', 'Bodily', 'function', 'including', 'not', 'limited', 'urination', 'hymen', 'destruction.', '8226', 'Occasional', 'male', 'genitalia', 'real', 'fake.', '8226', 'Nude', 'modeling', 'photographers', 'who', 'shoot', 'nude', 'models', '8226', 'Baked', 'goods.What', ""'m"", 'saying', 'Brass', 'work', 'highly', 'formulaic', 'not', 'say', 'bad', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'formula', 'Brass', ""n't"", 'content', 'beautiful', 'women', 'being', 'beautiful', 'present', 'situations', 'make', 'as', 'ugly', 'possible', 'Which', 'OK', 'were', 'French', 'art', 'house', 'movies', 'fine', 'are', ""n't"", 'are', 'labeled', 'erotica', 'point', 'try', 'turn', 'viewers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'who', 'hell', 'would', 'get', 'turned', 'seeing', 'woman', 'wiping', 'man', 'sniffing', 'butt', 'gratuitous', 'shot', 'blood', 'left', 'behind', 'following', 'virginal', 'deflowering.But', 'then', 'again', ""'m"", 'heterosexual', 'American', 'male', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'women', 'underarm', 'hair', 'Unfortunately', 'routine', 'Brass', 'movies.Concerning', '34', 'Frivolous', 'Lola', '34', 'particular', 'good', 'thing', 'get', 'metric', 'ton', 'full', 'frontal', 'leading', 'lady', 'Anna', 'Ammarati', 'who', 'young', 'virgin', 'who', 'sexual', 'overdrive', 'Engaged', 'be', 'married', 'would', 'appear', 'really', 'fiance', '34', 'stop', 'respecting', '34', 'take', 'virginity', 'wedding', 'over', 'again', 'However', 'totally', 'OK', 'hammering', 'breathtakingly-hot', 'hooker', 'wish', ""'d"", 'had', 'more', 'screen', 'time.The', 'good', 'basically', 'there', 'one', 'even', 'more', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'other', 'Brass', 'films', 'complex', 'nature', 'relationship', 'lead', 'character', 'father', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'really', 'know', 'certain', 'actually', 'father', 'just', 'man', 'who', 'father', 'relationship', 'had', 'mother', 'rate', 'sexual', 'tension', 'pretty', 'disgusting.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'hot', 'naked', 'women', 'are', 'better', 'places', 'look', 'even', 'Brass']",N/A
846565,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B0002VEUA8,Zack Davisson,"[1, 1]","Lola is actually a good girl.  Sure, she is a free spirit and loves to flirt with the local men, but her heart belongs to her betrothed Masetto, the son of the village baker.  The problem is that Masetto is a bit old-fashioned, and wants to wait until their wedding before sampling Lola's charms, something that Lola doesn't see the need for at all.  If they are going to do it eventually anyways, now is as good as tomorrow.She goes on a campaign to seduce Masetto before their wedding, using whatever tactics she can to enrage his jealousy and arouse his libido.  From there, it is a contest to see who will win first, Lola's desire or Masetto's convictions.  Really, the outcome is never in doubt.Like most Tinto Brass flicks, ""Frivolous Lola"" is little more than a celebration of the female form, of innocent sexuality, and of those who embrace the joys of life without shame or hesitation.  The story is never really the point, and he scripts just enough plot to give the actors something to say and characters personality to go along with their beauty.  This film is much more about the tease than his other films likeCheeky!, although the gals definitely put their all on display.At the end of the day, it is a fun and sexy bit of soft core, nothing terribly serious but just pure lovely eye candy.  I really like Brass's take on the genre, where all of the scenes happen in broad daylight and there is no perverse psychology.
