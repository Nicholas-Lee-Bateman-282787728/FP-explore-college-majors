1420248,A19BWRT516SX6L,B004MQ6W7S,"H. L. Mason ""relyonme""","[0, 0]","This is a highly entertaining documentary that does great credit to its two protagonists.  No doubt it has to be Fran Liebowitz who takes the prize, but that is in no small measure thanks to Martin Scorsese who has managed to present his subject in a most natural environment, where you feel as though you are present in the proceedings, and the director (although you see the back of his head) seems invisible.Such is the extraordinary force of her personality and humour, that there is never a dull moment.  That in fact is quite some compliment since I have never actually heard of Fran Liebowitz before (unfortunately). I shan't attempt to describe the contents of this extended interview, since those who already know Fran Liebowitz need no introduction, and those who don't - well you don't know what you're missing (unless you don't happen to like the New York ""take"" on life).I thank Mr. Scorsese for helping me make up for lost time, and if ever he should think of a sequel, count me in!",5,AS GOOD AS IT GETS,1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,996,"['highly', 'entertaining', 'documentary', 'great', 'credit', 'two', 'protagonists', 'doubt', 'be', 'Fran', 'Liebowitz', 'who', 'prize', 'small', 'measure', 'thanks', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'who', 'managed', 'present', 'subject', 'most', 'natural', 'environment', 'where', 'feel', 'are', 'present', 'proceedings', 'director', 'see', 'back', 'head', 'invisible.Such', 'extraordinary', 'force', 'personality', 'humour', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'fact', 'quite', 'compliment', 'have', 'never', 'actually', 'heard', 'Fran', 'Liebowitz', 'unfortunately', 'sha', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'describe', 'contents', 'extended', 'interview', 'who', 'already', 'know', 'Fran', 'Liebowitz', 'need', 'introduction', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'missing', 'do', ""n't"", 'happen', 'like', 'New', 'York', 'take', 'life', 'thank', 'Mr.', 'Scorsese', 'helping', 'make', 'up', 'lost', 'time', 'ever', 'should', 'think', 'sequel', 'count']",N/A
1420249,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004MQ6W7S,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","A quintessential New York personality, I really hadn't heard much about humorist Fran Lebowitz in recent years. So when Martin Scorsese's documentary ""Public Speaking"" popped up, I thought it would be interesting to see how the feisty Lebowitz was still getting along. Let's just say that she's as pleased with herself as ever and I certainly don't mean that in a negative way. Lebowitz, in a series of articles, essays and collections turned into books, was anointed one of the premiere social satirists of her day. A 1970's Dorothy Parker with scathing observational humor about the era in which she found fame, Lebowitz has been largely absent from the publishing scene for many years. Her most famous books were released in 1978 (""Metropolitan Life"") and 1981 (""Social Studies). There was finally another collection in 1994, ""The Fran Lebowitz Reader,"" which was still funny but was starting to show its age with quaintly out of sync cultural references.Lebowitz, however, as a personality is always larger than life. ""Public Speaking"" is framed, for the most part, as sitting down in a restaurant across from Lebowitz to enjoy her bon mots. And Scorsese and team genuinely love her, they practically die laughing! There are some personal appearance clips and stock footage (always enjoy the Conan O'Brien bit when she was promoting her children's book), but mostly it's just a modern Lebowitz dissecting herself. Known for her bitter truths and honesty, Lebowitz can be a divisive personality. I, for one, think she still has plenty of relevant opinions to contribute to a modern discourse on the state of the world.I think the recommendation of ""Public Speaking"" is a no-brainer for any fan of Lebowitz and those aware of her notoriety many years ago. Intellectual and incisive, it is a refreshing change of pace from some of the blander social commentary we've become inundated with in the growing entertainment market. Truth be told, we've become more and more distanced from personalities actually offering opinions (unless they are knee-jerk platitudes of an established religious or political party), much less pointedly critical ones. So I thank Lebowitz. Modern audiences, and I mean those new to Lebowitz, might have a split reaction to ""Public Speaking."" Some will find her observations funny and astute, and some may find her an artifact of days gone by (even if they find her funny and astute). Either way, though, ""Public Speaking"" is still a candid and amusing entertainment of a unique American personality.
