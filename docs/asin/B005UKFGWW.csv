E Jackson,"[1, 1]","I've been watching too many disappointing films lately so it's good to see a quality one crop up from time to time.In My Sleep is a murder/mystery with a twist- the man (played by Philip Winchester) apparently committing the murders does so while sleepwalking.  However the question running through 80% of the movie is this- is he *really* killing people in his sleep, or is he being set up using several carefully placed tricks?  He wakes up surrounded by unxplainable blood spots that don't belong to him but, it's definitely somebody's blood.  Does that mean he's guilty?  Does that mean he's a murderer?  This makes for a compelling story.What makes the story even MORE interesting is that the person murdered just happens to be his brothers wife after Philip and said wife actually have an affair together.  Philip wakes up in the morning with no recollection of the events that occurred over the night.  While this may sound like a typical guy thing (""I don't remember sleeping with her!"") there's more do it than that, haha.  Yes, *very* good idea for a storyline!  Amazingly, Philip being responsible for the murder is something he brings on himself due to nobody believing the severity of his sleepwalking issues.Throughout the film Philip's character constantly tries to figure out what actually happened that fateful night and put the clues together involving several women he meets (a photographer played by Lacey Chabert, a woman he meets during special meetings with a gathering of people (Abigail Spencer) and his mother (Beth Grant) to name a few).  Other big name actors and actresses such as Tony Hale from Arrested Development and Kirsten Vangsness from Criminal Minds aren't really utilized much, which is a shame.  Well let's just say, the storyline gets more involved and interesting as it rolls along as Philip appears to be well on his way of being guilty.I really can't say a whole lot more pertaining to the storyline since, you know, I'd only end up spoiling it and that's the LAST thing you're supposed to do with a film like this.  My only complaint is that there's a bit of confusion near the end involving Philip's sleepwalking that puts into question if he really *is* going around doing horrible things while sleepwalking or just pretending.  A segment involving Philip's father brings this aspect of the plot into serious question.  It was never officially stated so we're left to just assume or guess.Otherwise, I have nothing but good things to say about it.  In My Sleep begins on a less than spectacular note that makes you think it's going to be a low budget flick, but that's only because it's warming up for the plot to get underway.  Highly recommended.",5,"wow, finally!",1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,2695,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'too', 'many', 'disappointing', 'films', 'lately', 'good', 'see', 'quality', 'one', 'crop', 'time', 'time.In', 'My', 'Sleep', 'murder/mystery', 'twist-', 'man', 'played', 'Philip', 'Winchester', 'apparently', 'committing', 'murders', 'so', 'sleepwalking', 'However', 'question', 'running', '80', '%', 'movie', 'this-', 'killing', 'people', 'sleep', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'using', 'several', 'carefully', 'placed', 'tricks', 'up', 'surrounded', 'unxplainable', 'blood', 'spots', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'definitely', 'somebody', 'blood', 'mean', 'guilty', 'mean', 'murderer', 'compelling', 'story', 'even', 'MORE', 'interesting', 'person', 'murdered', 'just', 'happens', 'be', 'brothers', 'wife', 'Philip', 'said', 'wife', 'actually', 'have', 'affair', 'together', 'Philip', 'up', 'morning', 'recollection', 'events', 'occurred', 'night', 'may', 'sound', 'typical', 'guy', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'sleeping', 'more', 'do', 'haha', 'Yes', '*very*', 'good', 'idea', 'storyline', 'Amazingly', 'Philip', 'being', 'responsible', 'murder', 'something', 'due', 'nobody', 'believing', 'severity', 'sleepwalking', 'film', 'Philip', 'character', 'constantly', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'fateful', 'night', 'put', 'clues', 'together', 'involving', 'several', 'women', 'photographer', 'played', 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'woman', 'special', 'meetings', 'gathering', 'people', 'Abigail', 'Spencer', 'mother', 'Beth', 'Grant', 'name', 'few', 'Other', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'actresses', 'such', 'Tony', 'Hale', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'Kirsten', 'Vangsness', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'utilized', 'much', 'shame', 'Well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'storyline', 'more', 'involved', 'interesting', 'along', 'Philip', 'be', 'well', 'way', 'being', 'guilty.I', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'pertaining', 'storyline', 'know', ""'d"", 'only', 'end', 'up', 'spoiling', 'LAST', 'thing', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'do', 'film', 'only', 'complaint', 'bit', 'confusion', 'end', 'involving', 'Philip', 'sleepwalking', 'question', 'really', 'going', 'doing', 'horrible', 'things', 'sleepwalking', 'just', 'pretending', 'segment', 'involving', 'Philip', 'father', 'aspect', 'plot', 'serious', 'question', 'was', 'never', 'officially', 'stated', ""'re"", 'left', 'just', 'assume', 'guess.Otherwise', 'have', 'nothing', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'My', 'Sleep', 'less', 'spectacular', 'note', 'think', 'going', 'be', 'low', 'budget', 'flick', 'only', 'warming', 'up', 'plot', 'get', 'underway', 'Highly', 'recommended']",In My Sleep

1503998,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005UKFGWW,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Allen Wolf makes a fairly impressive writing/directing debut with this tense little thriller. Though there are many aspects of the film that seem like it is a very low budget, quickly produced little grade B movie, the presence of Philip Winchester makes it work. Not only is this actor first class eye candy, he holds a character well and makes us believe a rather implausible plot.Marcus (Philip Winchester) suffers from parasomnia (a category of sleep disorders that involves abnormal and unnatural movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, and dreams that occur while falling asleep, sleeping, between sleep stages, or during arousal from sleep. Most parasomnias are dissociated sleep states which are partial arousals during the transitions between wakefulness and NREM sleep, or wakefulness and REM sleep). He awakens with blood stained hands and when he hears that a close friend Ann (Kelly Overton) has been murdered he fears the worst. His best friend tries to be supportive but the police disrupt Marcus' own investigation of his behavior patterns when they come to arrest him for the murder. How the story ends is wracked with suspense and keeps the audience in suspense to the last minute.The supporting cast is spotty, but Lacey Chabert, Abigail Spencer and even Kirsten Vangsness from The Mentalist television series give solid support.  This is not a great movie but it is a chance to watch Philip Winchester grow beyond his previous roles and become a solid leading man.

1503999,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B005UKFGWW,G. Teslovich,"[0, 11]","Why so many reviewers said ""edge of your seat"" might suggest they all have connections to the same paid reviewer or they all have really small seats. And Hitchcock comparable, please, not even close. As far as acting it was typical TV acting which is what the cast's collective filmography credits amount to. The storyline about the human fear of losing control combined with our fear of the night has good storytelling potential but this story had too many improbable coincidences, one after another, to elicit nothing more than a ""sure"" reaction. A well repeated plot of everything pointing to the sleepwalker as the murdering police suspect when we know it's the wife's husband (and sleepwalker's close friend) who will ultimately be found out. Then there's the dead wife's long lost sister suddenly showing up and developing a relationship with the sleepwalking suspect. Add the frequent break ends with knife/blood plants in the sleepwalker's apartment; the unlocking of handcuffs while he's asleep all by the husband killer. The eventual meeting of the husband tries another knife plant on his long time buddy to make him think he's killed again was not believable. Really, how many times can the same routine be used on someone? In the final scene, as the police conveniently arrive during the anticlimactic struggle between the two guys, the husband kills himself with the same knife that he used to kill his wife.",2,Edge of Your Seat?,1324684800,"12 24, 2011",2011,1422,"['Why', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'said', 'edge', 'seat', 'might', 'suggest', 'have', 'connections', 'same', 'paid', 'reviewer', 'have', 'really', 'small', 'seats', 'Hitchcock', 'comparable', 'please', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'As', 'far', 'acting', 'was', 'typical', 'TV', 'acting', 'what', 'cast', 'collective', 'filmography', 'credits', 'amount', 'storyline', 'human', 'fear', 'losing', 'control', 'combined', 'fear', 'night', 'good', 'storytelling', 'potential', 'story', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'improbable', 'coincidences', 'one', 'elicit', 'nothing', 'more', 'sure', 'reaction', 'well', 'repeated', 'plot', 'everything', 'pointing', 'sleepwalker', 'murdering', 'police', 'suspect', 'when', 'know', 'wife', 'husband', 'sleepwalker', 'close', 'friend', 'who', 'will', 'ultimately', 'be', 'found', 'out', 'Then', 'dead', 'wife', 'long', 'lost', 'sister', 'suddenly', 'showing', 'up', 'developing', 'relationship', 'sleepwalking', 'suspect', 'Add', 'frequent', 'break', 'knife/blood', 'plants', 'sleepwalker', 'apartment', 'unlocking', 'handcuffs', 'asleep', 'husband', 'killer', 'eventual', 'meeting', 'husband', 'knife', 'plant', 'long', 'time', 'buddy', 'make', 'think', 'killed', 'again', 'was', 'not', 'believable', 'Really', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'same', 'routine', 'be', 'used', 'someone', 'final', 'scene', 'police', 'conveniently', 'arrive', 'anticlimactic', 'struggle', 'two', 'guys', 'husband', 'same', 'knife', 'used', 'kill', 'wife']",In My Sleep

The viewer is kept guessing what's happening here - right along with the sleep-disturbed protagonist of this fairly interesting mystery.There are some good extras on the DVD, including Director/Writer Allen Wolf's commentary. Wolfe tells a lot about his intentions making this first full-length feature film of his career. He repeatedly points out how important he felt it was to maintain a blue, subtly maritime color scheme throughout the film. He believed this suggested the God's-eye view he was trying to establish for the action, with the enfolding, religious overtones that go with such a perspective. All this emphasis on having the main characters appear - now in a blue shirt - now with a blue tie - gets a little boring and beside the point. I think the average viewer will feel Wolf need hardly have bothered with such pointless details. But Wolf is such an engaging, chatty narrator, that you'll probably want to stick with his commentary anyway.But do be sure to view the movie through without the commentary first. Wolf reveals every detail about the solution to the mystery very early in his commentary. If you play the DVD with his audio first, you'll immediately ruin the suspense.The DVD also includes a gag reel and a ""Making Of"" feature.
