Part romance, mix in a little comedy, a little racial tension and a stellar cast, and you get a good story that is completely watchable and believable.  I especially like that the movie ended with the romantic leads going their separate ways, possibly to reunite later.  Added a realistic touch.This was probably the movie before some of these actors hit the big time.

The movie centers around Adrien Body's character who has just been dumped. He is a beginning screenplay writer who works at a restaurant to pay the bills until he is successful. All the character's work at the restaurant. They vary in races and the premise is how they get along with each other.They movie is okay. I love Adrien Brody, so it was no big deal to watch him. He is a great actor and this role fit him. Elise Neal did a great job as a aspiring singer and his love interest. They movie was good, but not great. It lacked something, that I can' quite put my finger on. It had enough stars with Simon Baker, Lauryn Hill, Brody, and Neal, but something was missing.

551850,A1AM2YSWG5NRRJ,B00004U5RZ,"Sophia ""the thinker""","[1, 1]","I am a great fan of Simon Baker. He is so good at seemingly actually becoming the person he portrays. So many actors just portray themselves, although they can be quite good at that. This is one of Baker's earlier films when he was still calling himself Simon Baker-Denny. It's a small part but he carries it off so well! Beyond that, the story is really interesting, with excellent performances throughout. It is kind of a shock to see the views of the New York skyline with the World Trade Center towers still intact. A sad reminder of the destruction to come. I rated this at 4 stars only because there wasn't enough of Simon Baker's character for me, although it was enough for the story. I could spend the entire time just watching Baker watch paint dry.
