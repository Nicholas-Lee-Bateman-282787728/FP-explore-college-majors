1002133,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B000GDH9N2,Anton Ilinski,"[4, 5]","Although ""10th and Wolf"" is not a bad movie I was a bit disappointed. Since it's based on the same story as ""Donnie Brasco"" I was expecting something as intense and breathtaking as Mike Newell's film. And I have to say ""Donnie Brasco"" was more thorough and more thought-provoking than ""10th and Wolf"".It starts as Tommy (James Marsden) returns to Philadelphia from the army and he's having a deal with FBI to be an inside man in his cousin Joey's (Giovanni Ribisi) gang which has some business with mafia. Federals will be able to catch some bigger fish and Tommy will get a chance to save his younger brother Vince (Brad Renfro) and Joey from going to jail. So Tommy who never wanted to join the local gang starts having business with his friends and wears a wire.That's the basic story-line, but what I liked here was not this ""undercover agent"" plot but relationships between the main characters. Tommy who hasn't been home for some years begins to build his relations with his cousin, his brother, old friends and aunt - and all that looks rather interesting and vivid mostly due to the good actors taking part in the feature. The cast in ""10th and Wolf"" is indeed very nice. Marsden is surprisingly good, I never expected such a credible performance from him. Ribisi is awesome as always, he's full of energy, he's vigorous and a little bit mad. Renfro is also very good, he's almost always authentic albeit overacting sometimes. Piper Perabo is quite believable as a single mother and Tommy's love interest although we never get to see any love scenes in the movie. I can also mention Lesley Ann Warren whom I adore, actually I can't remember a role she was bad at. And Brian Dennehy with Leo Rossi were OK as two federal agents. What I disliked or rather was distracted with were the cameos of Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper and Tommy Lee. Hopper was the only one to get a sort of a real part in ""10th and Wolf"", but generally it looked like big names were used just to attract attention to the movie although they appeared on screen for 10 minutes altogether.Robert Moresco whose latest achievement was a screenplay for ""Crash"" did a nice writing and directing job here, but throughout the whole film I've felt something's missing. First it seemed to me ""10th and Wolf"" happened to be smaller than I thought it would be. It lacked some calibre. Or maybe some things seemed strange to me. Or maybe I had some doubts. Here they are:1. I doubt the gangs are usually consist of 5-6 persons. I thought of some bigger number. But in ""10th and Wolf"" it looks like the local gang really IS 5 people.2. I doubt a leader of the gang can be that young. Well, Giovanni Ribisi looks rather young especially after Dennis Hopper who was the head before.3. I doubt top mob members participate in everything their crew does, from negotiating to killing someone, they must have some apprentices.4. I doubt just two feds are handling the case of undercover agent and some mafia family. Obviously there's some other people, but here it sometimes seems that FBI is two persons only.5. I doubt a person who messed with a mob boss and then blackmailed two back-alley feds can walk away from this easily instead of being whacked by mobsters or corrupted feds.6. I doubt a mob boss would torture and kill someone in HIS OWN house where he lives, where his wife is waiting for him in an upstairs' bedroom.7. I doubt two persons, even armed, can easily intrude the mafia's boss house (who knows they can attempt to do it) killing all the resistance.I had some other doubts but I guess you got the idea. I read people from Philadelphia saying the film really captured the city's spirit. I don't live there so it's not up to me to judge, but if to sum it all up I've seen better: from ""A Bronx Tale"" to ""The Sopranos"". But with all my doubts there clearly are some positive things about ""10th and Wolf"". Nice story, directing and acting - I think that's quite enough, and as for several flaws - I sincerely think there are no movies without them. Maybe here they just stick out too evidently.",4,"ALL-IN-ALL NOT BAD, BUT WITH SOME APPARENT FLAWS",1155254400,"08 11, 2006",2006,4066,"['10th', 'Wolf', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'based', 'same', 'story', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'intense', 'breathtaking', 'Mike', 'Newell', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'was', 'more', 'thorough', 'more', 'thought-provoking', '10th', 'Wolf', '.It', 'Tommy', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Philadelphia', 'army', 'having', 'deal', 'FBI', 'be', 'inside', 'man', 'cousin', 'Joey', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'gang', 'business', 'mafia', 'Federals', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'catch', 'bigger', 'fish', 'Tommy', 'will', 'get', 'chance', 'save', 'younger', 'brother', 'Vince', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'Joey', 'going', 'jail', 'So', 'Tommy', 'who', 'never', 'wanted', 'join', 'local', 'gang', 'having', 'business', 'friends', 'basic', 'story-line', 'what', 'liked', 'here', 'was', 'not', 'undercover', 'agent', 'plot', 'relationships', 'main', 'characters', 'Tommy', 'who', ""n't"", 'been', 'home', 'years', 'build', 'relations', 'cousin', 'brother', 'old', 'friends', 'aunt', 'rather', 'interesting', 'vivid', 'mostly', 'due', 'good', 'actors', 'taking', 'part', 'feature', 'cast', '10th', 'Wolf', 'indeed', 'very', 'nice', 'Marsden', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'never', 'expected', 'such', 'credible', 'performance', 'Ribisi', 'awesome', 'always', 'full', 'energy', 'vigorous', 'little', 'bit', 'mad', 'Renfro', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'almost', 'always', 'authentic', 'overacting', 'sometimes', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'quite', 'believable', 'single', 'mother', 'Tommy', 'love', 'interest', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'love', 'scenes', 'movie', 'can', 'also', 'mention', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'whom', 'adore', 'actually', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'role', 'was', 'bad', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Leo', 'Rossi', 'were', 'OK', 'two', 'federal', 'agents', 'What', 'disliked', 'rather', 'was', 'distracted', 'were', 'cameos', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Hopper', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'get', 'sort', 'real', 'part', '10th', 'Wolf', 'generally', 'looked', 'big', 'names', 'were', 'used', 'just', 'attract', 'attention', 'movie', 'appeared', 'screen', '10', 'minutes', 'altogether.Robert', 'Moresco', 'latest', 'achievement', 'was', 'screenplay', 'Crash', 'did', 'nice', 'writing', 'directing', 'job', 'here', 'whole', 'film', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'something', 'missing', 'First', 'seemed', '10th', 'Wolf', 'happened', 'be', 'smaller', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'lacked', 'calibre', 'maybe', 'things', 'seemed', 'strange', 'maybe', 'had', 'doubts', 'Here', 'are:1', 'doubt', 'gangs', 'are', 'usually', 'consist', '5-6', 'persons', 'thought', 'bigger', 'number', '10th', 'Wolf', 'local', 'gang', 'really', '5', 'people.2', 'doubt', 'leader', 'gang', 'can', 'be', 'young', 'Well', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'rather', 'young', 'especially', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'who', 'was', 'head', 'before.3', 'doubt', 'top', 'mob', 'members', 'participate', 'everything', 'crew', 'negotiating', 'killing', 'someone', 'must', 'have', 'apprentices.4', 'doubt', 'just', 'two', 'feds', 'are', 'handling', 'case', 'undercover', 'agent', 'mafia', 'family', 'Obviously', 'other', 'people', 'here', 'sometimes', 'FBI', 'two', 'persons', 'only.5', 'doubt', 'person', 'who', 'messed', 'mob', 'boss', 'then', 'blackmailed', 'two', 'back-alley', 'feds', 'can', 'walk', 'away', 'easily', 'instead', 'being', 'whacked', 'mobsters', 'corrupted', 'feds.6', 'doubt', 'mob', 'boss', 'would', 'torture', 'kill', 'someone', 'HIS', 'OWN', 'house', 'where', 'where', 'wife', 'waiting', 'upstairs', 'bedroom.7', 'doubt', 'two', 'persons', 'even', 'armed', 'can', 'easily', 'intrude', 'mafia', 'boss', 'house', 'who', 'can', 'attempt', 'do', 'killing', 'resistance.I', 'had', 'other', 'doubts', 'guess', 'got', 'idea', 'read', 'people', 'Philadelphia', 'saying', 'film', 'really', 'captured', 'city', 'spirit', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'there', 'not', 'up', 'judge', 'sum', 'up', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'A', 'Bronx', 'Tale', 'Sopranos', 'doubts', 'clearly', 'are', 'positive', 'things', '10th', 'Wolf', 'Nice', 'story', 'directing', 'acting', 'think', 'quite', 'enough', 'several', 'flaws', 'sincerely', 'think', 'are', 'movies', 'Maybe', 'here', 'just', 'stick', 'out', 'too', 'evidently']",10th and Wolf
1002134,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000GDH9N2,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 2]","If you've seen DONNIE BRASCO, you've seen parts of 10TH & WOLF.Here we have Tommy (James Marsden, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND) trying to set his life straight. After finding out that his father was a hit-man for a local boss, Tommy soon sees him gunned down on the street. Twelve-year-old Tommy never forgets this and once eighteen, joins the marines and is whisked off to the Persian Gulf. He fights the war his country tells him to fight, only to learn that they can't go into Baghdad and capture Saddam in the end. Tommy loses control of himself, hits an MP, and steals a colonel's Jeep. Now in hot-water, and facing a court martial, he is shipped back to the brig in the U.S. where he's approached by Agent Horvath (Brian Dennehy, COCOON) of the FBI. Tommy is told that what remains of his family is in danger. His brother Vincent (Brad Renfro, GHOST WORLD) has fallen in with a friend's ""business."" This friend is Joey (Giovanni Ribisi, THE GIFT) who's attempting to become a boss of his own. The hitch is that Joey also saved Tommy's life once, and Tommy loves Joey like a second brother. Agent Horvath explains that another wannabe boss in the area needs to be caught on tape with incriminating evidence so that they can put him away. Joey and Tommy's brother Vincent will be given an easy deal IF Tommy cooperates.Tommy returns to 10th and Wolf, his true home, and rekindles his friendship with Joey. But once in tight with him, Tommy's values toward family and friends comes creeping up. That he cares deeply for Joey is all too evident; he may even care more for Joey than he does his own brother, something that is touched on in the film.In the end, Tommy has to make a tough decision that is supposed to save his brother, but put Joey in harms way. Not willing to let Joey go through the danger alone, Tommy accompanies him into an explosive situation, only to learn that his brother Vincent's mortal coil may have been shed already.Although fairly predictable, the story has some wonderful acting moments. Giovanni Ribisi was flawless as the cocky start-up Joey. Every scene he was in felt electrified. There's one in particular that stands out. It is where he and Tommy stand near a fence toward the end of the film and Joey speaks of trust and those who wear wires for ""the good guys."" It is a very touching and dangerous moment, because the audience doesn't know if Joey is going to kill Tommy or if his cold heart actually has a place for Tommy in it.That there aren't any ""big bosses"" around adds a tension to the flick that is often lacking in other more gratuitously violent mafioso movies. Joey and another small time crook are trying to become godfathers of their own in the small community, and it is their battles with the past, as much as with each other, that makes this film stand out above its predecessors.",4,Mini Mafioso,1162339200,"11 1, 2006",2006,2829,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'DONNIE', 'BRASCO', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'parts', '10TH', 'WOLF.Here', 'have', 'Tommy', 'James', 'Marsden', 'X-MEN', 'LAST', 'STAND', 'trying', 'set', 'life', 'straight', 'finding', 'out', 'father', 'was', 'hit-man', 'local', 'boss', 'Tommy', 'soon', 'gunned', 'down', 'street', 'Twelve-year-old', 'Tommy', 'never', 'once', 'eighteen', 'marines', 'whisked', 'Persian', 'Gulf', 'war', 'country', 'fight', 'only', 'learn', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'Baghdad', 'capture', 'Saddam', 'end', 'Tommy', 'control', 'MP', 'colonel', 'Jeep', 'Now', 'hot-water', 'facing', 'court', 'martial', 'shipped', 'back', 'brig', 'U.S.', 'where', 'approached', 'Agent', 'Horvath', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'COCOON', 'FBI', 'Tommy', 'told', 'what', 'family', 'danger', 'brother', 'Vincent', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'GHOST', 'WORLD', 'fallen', 'friend', 'business', 'friend', 'Joey', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'THE', 'GIFT', 'who', 'attempting', 'become', 'boss', 'own', 'hitch', 'Joey', 'also', 'saved', 'Tommy', 'life', 'once', 'Tommy', 'Joey', 'second', 'brother', 'Agent', 'Horvath', 'wannabe', 'boss', 'area', 'be', 'caught', 'tape', 'incriminating', 'evidence', 'can', 'put', 'away', 'Joey', 'Tommy', 'brother', 'Vincent', 'will', 'be', 'given', 'easy', 'deal', 'IF', 'Tommy', 'cooperates.Tommy', 'returns', '10th', 'Wolf', 'true', 'home', 'friendship', 'Joey', 'once', 'tight', 'Tommy', 'values', 'family', 'friends', 'creeping', 'up', 'deeply', 'Joey', 'too', 'evident', 'may', 'even', 'care', 'more', 'Joey', 'own', 'brother', 'something', 'touched', 'film.In', 'end', 'Tommy', 'make', 'tough', 'decision', 'supposed', 'save', 'brother', 'put', 'Joey', 'harms', 'way', 'Not', 'willing', 'let', 'Joey', 'go', 'danger', 'alone', 'Tommy', 'explosive', 'situation', 'only', 'learn', 'brother', 'Vincent', 'mortal', 'coil', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'shed', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'story', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'moments', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'was', 'flawless', 'cocky', 'start-up', 'Joey', 'Every', 'scene', 'was', 'felt', 'electrified', 'one', 'particular', 'out', 'where', 'Tommy', 'stand', 'fence', 'end', 'film', 'Joey', 'speaks', 'trust', 'who', 'wear', 'wires', 'good', 'guys', 'very', 'touching', 'dangerous', 'moment', 'audience', ""n't"", 'know', 'Joey', 'going', 'kill', 'Tommy', 'cold', 'heart', 'actually', 'place', 'Tommy', 'it.That', 'are', ""n't"", 'big', 'bosses', 'tension', 'flick', 'often', 'lacking', 'other', 'more', 'gratuitously', 'violent', 'mafioso', 'movies', 'Joey', 'small', 'time', 'crook', 'are', 'trying', 'become', 'godfathers', 'own', 'small', 'community', 'battles', 'past', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'film', 'stand', 'out', 'predecessors']",10th and Wolf
1002135,A1SP38JKYFFVJS,B000GDH9N2,Caesar M. Warrington,"[13, 18]","The title of my review alone should tell you what a bad movie we have here.How this movie stinks... let me count the ways:1. The name of the movie itself is ridiculous. 10th & Wolf is a quiet, lower-middle class residential corner in South Philly. It is certainly not the gritty, gray hub of underworld crime.2. At the beginning of the film, the lead character, Tommy (James Marsden), is a Marine in the brig, facing a life sentence. What for? For  hitting an MP and stealing an officer's jeep!3. When he arrives ""home to Philadelphia,"" Tommy jumps off a Pittsburgh Transit bus!4. Also take notice of all those hilly streets, which scream ""Hey! Look at me in wonderful, downtown Pittsburgh!"" (Philly is as flat as an ironing board).5. The only true Philly street actually used here is the corner of 9th & South; which, by the way, is 20 blocks away from the true 10th & Wolf, and looks nothing like that neighborhood.6. The 1984 flashback scene has the young Tommy & Joey, sitting in the (non-existent) 10th & Wolf Diner listening to the J. Geils Band and the Stray Cats. As anyone growing up in South Philly at that time knows, the problem with this scene lies in the simple fact that no self-respecting Italian cornerboy back then was listening to this or much of any other Rock music. The soundtrack to South Philly corner life for Italian kids in the '80s was Dance/Club music and what we now call ""Old School"" Hip Hop. Saturday night was usually Oldies night, when everybody tried to show off just how much Doo-Wop or Motown they knew.7. Giovanni Ribisi playing the role of Joey, the head of a mob outfit, is simply laughable.8. Mob leaders do not often do their own hits and dirty work, they have other guys to do it for them.9. What did the makers of this movie hope to accomplish by having so much well-known talent walking in and out of scenes, wasting their talents?Brian Dennehy, Dennis Hopper, and Leo Rossi contribute nothing to this film - and it's certainly not their fault. Worst of all, it was was quite sad to see a veteran actress like the still-beautiful Leslie Ann Warren kept in a dingy rowhome, dancing to old Disco songs in tacky MILF outfits throughtout this sorry hackjob of a mob flick.10. Speaking of actors and actresses: Where are those who actually come from South Philly (geez... or at least from Jersey or New York even)? Only the minor character of Rocco is played by a true South Philly Joey. This happens to be Tony Luke, Jr. (the real-life cheese steak and sandwich honcho who, by the way, happened to have attended the same grade school that I did: St. Nicholas of Tolentine) Perhaps such an absence of locally born talent helps to explain why the actors mispronounce the derogatory term for Sicilians (it is pronounced ""sidge-ee,"" not ""see-jee"") and fail to mention the correct local parish for this so-called famous corner of ""10th & Wolf,"" - that would be Epiphany of Our Lord, not Sacred Heart (which is all the way down on 3rd & Reed Streets).I can go on with a couple of dozen more errors, discrepencies, and things I've observed to be amateurish, fake, or just simply goofy; however, I'll consider your valuable time and just finish this out by saying that this is a bad movie. A piece of moviemaking that attempted to take some of the best bits of mob movie classics and, stuffing itself full of gory violence and over-acting, hope we'll buy the botched finished product as intense urban drama.That it only has 10 other reviews posted here should also help confirm my condemnation.",1,A Movie About the South Philly Mob ...

1002140,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000GDH9N2,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","Robert Moresco ('Crash') is proving to be a fine storyteller with a definite style of his own.  10TH & WOLF, written by both Moresco and Allan Steele and directed by Moresco appears on the shelves of DVDs as one of those films that makes us wonder why it didn't do well on the theater screens: it is well written, beautifully directed, has a cast that is consistently fine, and unravels a family involved in organized crime theme as well as any movie out there.Moresco very wisely starts his story in the burning oil fields of Kuwait during Desert Storm where Marine sargeant Tommy (James Marsden, doing his finest work since his brilliant portrayal in THE 24TH HOUR) drives his Hummer through the desert, coming to grips with the absurdity of war, a key turn in his personality causing him to be dishonorably discharged for his refusal to take part in that ridiculous war game.  He is given a deal: FBI agents Horvath (Brian Dennehy) and Thornton (Leo Rossi) visit his cell stateside and offer him clemency if he helps them capture a big drug dealer Reggio (Francesco Salvi) in Tommy's hometown of Philadelphia.  Tommy had escaped the organized crime scene by joining the Marines, but is suddenly returned to his family occupation as an undercover agent with a wire.  Tommy's brother Vincent (Brad Renfro) and his cousin Joey (Giovanni Ribisi) welcome his return and begin plotting ways to off Reggio.  Beatings and murders begin to occur: Joey is a bit on the mad side and plunges his boys into messes that become like quicksand.  How the family bonds over losses to big crime and vendettas,  and how that lifestyle affects parents (Lesley Ann Warren) and  victims turned girlfriends (Piper Perabo) leaving the drive to survive  as the paramount goal is the run of the plot.There are plenty of cameos (Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Dash Mihok etc) to round out the dark atmosphere, but the strength of the film lies strongly on the shoulders of Marsden, Ribisi and Renfro and they handle their roles exceptionally well.

1002142,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000GDH9N2,Lee Armstrong,"[14, 14]","""10th & Wolf"" is a crime drama that keeps your attention.  James Marsden who came on my radar screen with the last season of TV's ""Ally McBeal"" and then played in the 3 X-Men films, ""Bobby,"" and a good sleeper ""Gossip"" leads as Tommy Santoro, a soldier dishonorably discharged and then made to go undercover with the Mafia, a past he's been trying to forget.  Unfortunately his brother Vincent has stayed close to their roots.  Played by Brad Renfro whose first film in 1994 was ""The Client"" and recently appeared in ""The Jacket,"" Vincent is a dim-witted by good-hearted gangster.  Their cousin Joey is played by Giovanni Ribisi who has starred in a number of films including ""The Gift,"" ""Cold Mountain,"" & ""Gone in 60 Seconds.""  Giovanni plays the ruthless gangster who has more bullets than brains.  Leo Rossi does an excellent job as the sleazy cop Thornton.  While he doesn't get much screen time, he does have producer billing and his icy stares are enough to chill the tropics.  Brian Dennehy plays the other wheeler-dealer cop Horvath who ropes Tommy into wearing a wire.  Lesley Ann Warren does a nice job as the vulnerable Aunt Tina who is half alcoholic, half nymphomaniac.  Dennis Hopper has a good cameo as Matello, a godfather type.  Val Kilmer comes & goes rather quickly as Murtha, a drunken barfly.  Riding high on his Oscar for Best Screenplay for ""Crash,"" this was Bobby Moresco's directorial debut.  The film is shot very dark, which seems to give it a gothic feel as much as that of a crime drama.  There is a hefty body count and a bullet ballet to conclude the film.  This film goes down easy, even if it tends to evaporate soon after viewing.

1002144,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,B000GDH9N2,Pork Chop,"[0, 0]","10th and Wolf (2006)  promises thrills and a story told in the first person,concerning the ultra-dangerous  living environment of those taking part inthe underworld, tempted by the millions of dollars in earnings from the importof cocaine, and its distribution in night clubs; yet resolved in accepting the fatereserved for those taking part in it:  often a  fast trip to the morgue, through  gangrivalry and jealousies.One strength of this picture, is its consistent, calm,  subtle, moody,and nostalgic approach in laying out the point of view of the story teller,concerning  past life events. Although  pigeon-holed mentally, asa Marine veteran in terms of job skills, this might also  stem somewhat from PTSD afterbeing released from  service, from being user the pressure of being a paidconfidential informant for the  government,  based on an ease in approachingchildhood friends from the past, and capturing their dialog on tape,  and relayingnews, plans,  tactics from the underworld to the FBI, as hard evidence for usein the courts against the gangs. As such, the realism is extreme, taking themovie to the next level for viewers, who ""buy into"" the  action.Giovanni Ribisi, once again, (as in past films) does an outstanding job inrelaying to the audience, the psychological landscape of the gang leader,who, as a third generation American, doesn't buy into the European - Sicilianmob rules of his forefathers and rival in the city -  not only culturally,linguistically, -  but also in not seeing past his own limitations. In fact, Ribisishows a leader  fully conscious of his limited shelf life, so to speak,in that operating  environment, yet paradoxically is comforted and satisfiedwith  his modest ability to think things through, or the implications of certainmurders that are spontaneously  and irrationally done, for trivial motives.The film also builds a rapport with the audience, by recalling recent events (DesertStorm deployment in the Middle East) as well as the mental conditioning thatis learned  and stays with a person  after they completed  military training and alsoafter they have left active service. The ""quid pro quo""  as a survival mechanism is anotherinteresting theme in the work.Brian Dennehy is a plus to this picture, from his gravitas and clean cut lookin the FBI role, who admittedly, has to cross the line, into a grey area, to gethis job  done,  through the use of confidential informants, threats and more.""You're up the creek, but maybe I've got a paddle for you!"" he says.furtherThe soundtrack is exactly as required, from its  minimal role in the movie, furtheremphasizing the subtlety of the picture, necessary to give meaning to  other moments,in terms of underlying feelings, emotions, human relationships, etc.The filming is no-nonsense,  excellent wide-screen and consistent high quality.The acting, filming, the drawing of the audience into the action makes this DVD remarkableand worth seeing, although James Marsden's acting might be an acquired taste, yet  reminiscentof the late Brad Davis.",4,Reality based and worth seeing,1215561600,"07 9, 2008",2008,3047,"['10th', 'Wolf', '2006', 'thrills', 'story', 'told', 'first', 'person', 'concerning', 'ultra-dangerous', 'living', 'environment', 'taking', 'part', 'inthe', 'underworld', 'tempted', 'millions', 'dollars', 'earnings', 'importof', 'cocaine', 'distribution', 'night', 'clubs', 'yet', 'resolved', 'accepting', 'fatereserved', 'taking', 'part', 'often', 'fast', 'trip', 'morgue', 'gangrivalry', 'jealousies.One', 'strength', 'picture', 'consistent', 'calm', 'subtle', 'moody', 'nostalgic', 'approach', 'laying', 'out', 'point', 'view', 'story', 'teller', 'concerning', 'past', 'life', 'events', 'pigeon-holed', 'mentally', 'asa', 'Marine', 'veteran', 'terms', 'job', 'skills', 'might', 'also', 'stem', 'somewhat', 'PTSD', 'afterbeing', 'released', 'service', 'being', 'pressure', 'being', 'paidconfidential', 'informant', 'government', 'based', 'ease', 'approachingchildhood', 'friends', 'past', 'capturing', 'dialog', 'tape', 'relayingnews', 'plans', 'tactics', 'underworld', 'FBI', 'hard', 'evidence', 'usein', 'courts', 'gangs', 'such', 'realism', 'extreme', 'taking', 'themovie', 'next', 'level', 'viewers', 'who', 'buy', 'action.Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'once', 'again', 'past', 'films', 'outstanding', 'job', 'inrelaying', 'audience', 'psychological', 'landscape', 'gang', 'leader', 'who', 'third', 'generation', 'American', ""n't"", 'buy', 'European', 'Sicilianmob', 'rules', 'forefathers', 'rival', 'city', 'not', 'only', 'culturally', 'linguistically', 'also', 'not', 'seeing', 'own', 'limitations', 'fact', 'leader', 'fully', 'conscious', 'limited', 'shelf', 'life', 'so', 'speak', 'operating', 'environment', 'yet', 'paradoxically', 'comforted', 'satisfiedwith', 'modest', 'ability', 'think', 'things', 'implications', 'certainmurders', 'are', 'spontaneously', 'irrationally', 'done', 'trivial', 'motives.The', 'film', 'also', 'rapport', 'audience', 'recalling', 'recent', 'events', 'DesertStorm', 'deployment', 'Middle', 'East', 'as', 'well', 'mental', 'conditioning', 'thatis', 'learned', 'person', 'completed', 'military', 'training', 'alsoafter', 'have', 'left', 'active', 'service', 'quid', 'pro', 'quo', 'survival', 'mechanism', 'anotherinteresting', 'theme', 'work.Brian', 'Dennehy', 'plus', 'picture', 'gravitas', 'clean', 'cut', 'lookin', 'FBI', 'role', 'who', 'admittedly', 'cross', 'line', 'grey', 'area', 'gethis', 'job', 'done', 'use', 'confidential', 'informants', 'threats', 'more', ""'re"", 'up', 'creek', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'got', 'paddle', 'soundtrack', 'exactly', 'as', 'required', 'minimal', 'role', 'movie', 'furtheremphasizing', 'subtlety', 'picture', 'necessary', 'give', 'meaning', 'other', 'moments', 'terms', 'underlying', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'human', 'relationships', 'etc.The', 'filming', 'no-nonsense', 'excellent', 'wide-screen', 'consistent', 'high', 'quality.The', 'acting', 'filming', 'drawing', 'audience', 'action', 'DVD', 'remarkableand', 'worth', 'seeing', 'James', 'Marsden', 'acting', 'might', 'be', 'acquired', 'taste', 'yet', 'reminiscentof', 'late', 'Brad', 'Davis']",10th and Wolf
