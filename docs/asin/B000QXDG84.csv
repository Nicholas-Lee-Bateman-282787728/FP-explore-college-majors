1078287,A2VF73N1AI95SQ,B000QXDG84,Dylan,"[0, 0]","In the Inuyasha Season Four DVD Box Set you will recieve 18 interesting and fairly good episodes of the series on four DVDs. Naraku has disappeared after being pushed to the brink of destruction. Now our heros must find the fiend and finish him once and for all. However, it's not as easy as it sounds.Let me begin by saying that Season Four of this series is probably the weakest one in regards to quality and length, unless you count a Season Seven made from the last seven episodes of the series, in which case that would be the weakest, though I believe all those episodes are better than these 18. All other seasons of Inuyasha,(1-3,5,6) have 27 episodes.Really, these 18 episodes are more so on the light side of entertainment as the majority of them are based off of comedic plots. By the end of the season they don't find Naraku, in fact he never even appears in the season, though he is mentioned MANY times. This lack of Naraku is a huge weakness to the season, as is its length and large number of seemingly pointless episodes that barely advance the plot if at all.Despite this however, I must admit that every comedic episode is funny in its own way, from the Three Sprites of the Monkey God to Sota's Brave Confession of Love, and even Jaken Falls Ill, though that last one is more heartwarming than anything. Other funny episodes include Kirara Come Home! and Nursing Battle of the Rival Lovers. This season does have a few interesting and important episodes such as the introduction of Ayame, and of course the most important episode of the season plot wise, Kikyo's Lonely Journey. Information from this episode will play a huge role in Season Five, what I consider to be the best season of the series.Extras are lacking as is usual for these box sets and to pay 80 dollars is ridiculous in my opinion. I found this for 35 at a nearby Wal Mart which I believe is a much more appropriate price. Still, while there are less episodes and most may seem pointless, they do have their charm. Overall, this set is a must own for any Inuyasha Collector. I can't wait until my favorite season,five,is finally released!",4,Probably the Weakest Season of a Terrific Series,1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,2126,"['Inuyasha', 'Season', 'Four', 'DVD', 'Box', 'Set', 'will', 'recieve', '18', 'interesting', 'fairly', 'good', 'episodes', 'series', 'four', 'DVDs', 'Naraku', 'disappeared', 'being', 'pushed', 'brink', 'destruction', 'Now', 'heros', 'must', 'find', 'fiend', 'finish', 'once', 'However', 'not', 'as', 'easy', 'sounds.Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'Season', 'Four', 'series', 'probably', 'weakest', 'one', 'regards', 'quality', 'length', 'count', 'Season', 'Seven', 'made', 'last', 'seven', 'episodes', 'series', 'case', 'would', 'be', 'weakest', 'believe', 'episodes', 'are', 'better', '18', 'other', 'seasons', 'Inuyasha', '1-3,5,6', 'have', '27', 'episodes.Really', '18', 'episodes', 'are', 'more', 'so', 'light', 'side', 'entertainment', 'majority', 'are', 'based', 'comedic', 'plots', 'end', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'Naraku', 'fact', 'never', 'even', 'season', 'mentioned', 'MANY', 'times', 'lack', 'Naraku', 'huge', 'weakness', 'season', 'length', 'large', 'number', 'seemingly', 'pointless', 'episodes', 'barely', 'advance', 'plot', 'all.Despite', 'however', 'must', 'admit', 'comedic', 'episode', 'funny', 'own', 'way', 'Three', 'Sprites', 'Monkey', 'God', 'Sota', 'Brave', 'Confession', 'Love', 'even', 'Jaken', 'Falls', 'Ill', 'last', 'one', 'more', 'heartwarming', 'anything', 'Other', 'funny', 'episodes', 'include', 'Kirara', 'Come', 'Home', 'Nursing', 'Battle', 'Rival', 'Lovers', 'season', 'have', 'few', 'interesting', 'important', 'episodes', 'such', 'introduction', 'Ayame', 'course', 'most', 'important', 'episode', 'season', 'plot', 'wise', 'Kikyo', 'Lonely', 'Journey', 'Information', 'episode', 'will', 'play', 'huge', 'role', 'Season', 'Five', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'best', 'season', 'series.Extras', 'are', 'lacking', 'usual', 'box', 'sets', 'pay', '80', 'dollars', 'ridiculous', 'opinion', 'found', '35', 'nearby', 'Wal', 'Mart', 'believe', 'much', 'more', 'appropriate', 'price', 'Still', 'are', 'less', 'episodes', 'most', 'may', 'seem', 'pointless', 'do', 'have', 'charm', 'Overall', 'set', 'must', 'own', 'Inuyasha', 'Collector', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'favorite', 'season', 'five', 'finally', 'released']",Inuyasha - Season 4
1078288,AFM9DJYPNM7VT,B000QXDG84,"Goldencat ""Carla""","[5, 6]","Very happy I got this season, I was unsure because of some of the negative comments - it's hard to know what to believe when passionate people praise or attack a program they like.Yes, it is ""lighter"" than other sets. I'm happy about that, though. I do not always want to view lots of tension and intrigue, especialy before going to sleep. It is nice to be able to play an episode or two and just be entertained, or laugh.For example, the episode ""Mysterious, lecherous monk"" is about Mirouku getting in trouble because Hatchi (raccoon spirit) impersonates him. There is one with ""the 3 sprites of the Monkey God"", where Shippo is more of a dominant character. It's really cute, and there are jokes you must know a bit about Japanese culture to get. For example, what happens to the stone that is a relic from the monkey god's shrine ... hysterical, if you know the reverence due such an object, and the solemness a shrine's protectors should show.A few more plots: There is one where Kagome's school admirer visits at the same time as Inuyasha, because she has a cold. Another has Shessomaru meeting Koga ... also funny, more so if you know how wolves and feudal Japanese should act to one another. There are episodes featuring Kikyo and Kagome working together, Koga and his young fiancee, and one with Kagome's little brother falling in love. There's one focusing more on Rin and Jaken. One focuses on Kirara disappearing, and ""the black Kirara"" stars another 2-tailed cat, a little girl, and Shippo. I like them all, and I liked seeing their personalities more than when focus is on the usual main characters.I think, as a writer and a fan, that it is good to see more of the supporting characters than usual in an episode. It helps understand them. Why do they react - or don't - to certain events? How do they relate to each other, and how did their relationships blossom?The disks fold out, and have a slipjacket. There are subtitles, but I had problems switching those off and resuming the episode. I have had to reset the subtitles and then select the scene I want to go to, instead of using a ""resume"" option. Otherwise it just plays from the very beginning episode again.If you're impatient to get to the Naraku-fighting parts, skip to season 5.",5,lighter than the other seasons,1341964800,"07 11, 2012",2012,2256,"['Very', 'happy', 'got', 'season', 'was', 'unsure', 'negative', 'comments', 'hard', 'know', 'what', 'believe', 'when', 'passionate', 'people', 'praise', 'attack', 'program', 'like.Yes', 'lighter', 'other', 'sets', ""'m"", 'happy', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'want', 'view', 'lots', 'tension', 'intrigue', 'especialy', 'going', 'sleep', 'nice', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'episode', 'two', 'just', 'be', 'entertained', 'laugh.For', 'example', 'episode', 'Mysterious', 'lecherous', 'monk', 'Mirouku', 'getting', 'trouble', 'Hatchi', 'raccoon', 'spirit', 'one', '3', 'sprites', 'Monkey', 'God', 'where', 'Shippo', 'more', 'dominant', 'character', 'really', 'cute', 'are', 'jokes', 'must', 'know', 'bit', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'get', 'example', 'what', 'stone', 'relic', 'monkey', 'god', 'shrine', 'hysterical', 'know', 'reverence', 'due', 'object', 'solemness', 'shrine', 'protectors', 'should', 'show.A', 'few', 'more', 'plots', 'one', 'where', 'Kagome', 'school', 'admirer', 'visits', 'same', 'time', 'Inuyasha', 'cold', 'Shessomaru', 'meeting', 'Koga', 'also', 'funny', 'more', 'so', 'know', 'how', 'wolves', 'feudal', 'Japanese', 'should', 'act', 'one', 'are', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'Kikyo', 'Kagome', 'working', 'together', 'Koga', 'young', 'fiancee', 'one', 'Kagome', 'little', 'brother', 'falling', 'love', 'one', 'focusing', 'more', 'Rin', 'Jaken', 'One', 'Kirara', 'disappearing', 'black', 'Kirara', '2-tailed', 'cat', 'little', 'girl', 'Shippo', 'liked', 'seeing', 'personalities', 'more', 'when', 'focus', 'usual', 'main', 'characters.I', 'think', 'writer', 'fan', 'good', 'see', 'more', 'supporting', 'characters', 'usual', 'episode', 'understand', 'Why', 'do', 'react', 'do', ""n't"", 'certain', 'events', 'How', 'do', 'relate', 'other', 'how', 'did', 'relationships', 'blossom', 'disks', 'fold', 'out', 'have', 'slipjacket', 'are', 'subtitles', 'had', 'problems', 'switching', 'resuming', 'episode', 'have', 'had', 'reset', 'subtitles', 'then', 'select', 'scene', 'want', 'go', 'instead', 'using', 'resume', 'option', 'Otherwise', 'just', 'very', 'beginning', 'episode', ""'re"", 'impatient', 'get', 'Naraku-fighting', 'parts', 'skip', 'season', '5']",Inuyasha - Season 4

1078293,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B000QXDG84,Lesley Aeschliman,"[0, 0]","This Inuyasha box set contains four DVDs, and has all eighteen episodes that comprise the fourth season of the series.  The first two discs contain five episodes, the third disc contains four episodes, and the fourth disc includes four episodes and the special features.The first special feature is labeled as ""Character Introductions.""  This is a roughly three-minute piece that introduces the characters of Kagome, Inuyasha, Kikyo, Sesshomaru, Myoga, Shippo, Miroku, Naraku, and Sango (although Sango is never mentioned by name).  By seeing the characters that are featured in this piece, as well as the footage used in it, I assume this was put together after the first season of the series.  It feels like this feature was included because they needed something to fill out the special features menu.  The thinking that probably went into this was that since this wasn't used for any of the previous box sets, to go ahead and throw it on here to say there are three special features instead of two.The next feature is ""Textless Openings.""  These are textless versions of both of the openings that appear on this box set, and they are put back-to-back as one piece.  However, the textless version of the first opening already appeared on the box set for the third season, so it seemed rather pointless to include it here as well.The last feature is ""Textless Endings.""  Just like the ""Textless Openings,"" this includes textless versions of both of the endings that appear on this set.  The textless version of the first ending already appeared on the box set for season three, so I question why it was included.This particular season of Inuyasha didn't seem to progress the story much, if at all.  While some of the episodes were entertaining, they really weren't that important to the overall story.  This was rather disappointing, especially after all of the character development and story progression that took place during the third season.  In a lot of respects, the fourth season of Inuyasha feels more like a ""filler"" season than anything else.If you're a fan of Inuyasha and want to have all of the episodes on DVD, then you need to acquire this set.  However, I'm not entirely convinced that this particular set is worth the retail price (as of this writing, the set is retailing for around $90, which is the same price as the first three sets).",2,Not as strong as the previous Inuyasha DVD box sets,1225152000,"10 28, 2008",2008,2358,"['Inuyasha', 'box', 'set', 'four', 'DVDs', 'eighteen', 'episodes', 'comprise', 'fourth', 'season', 'series', 'first', 'two', 'discs', 'contain', 'five', 'episodes', 'third', 'disc', 'four', 'episodes', 'fourth', 'disc', 'four', 'episodes', 'special', 'features.The', 'first', 'special', 'feature', 'labeled', 'Character', 'Introductions', 'roughly', 'three-minute', 'piece', 'characters', 'Kagome', 'Inuyasha', 'Kikyo', 'Sesshomaru', 'Myoga', 'Shippo', 'Miroku', 'Naraku', 'Sango', 'Sango', 'never', 'mentioned', 'name', 'seeing', 'characters', 'are', 'featured', 'piece', 'as', 'well', 'footage', 'used', 'assume', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'feature', 'was', 'included', 'needed', 'something', 'fill', 'out', 'special', 'features', 'menu', 'thinking', 'probably', 'went', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'previous', 'box', 'sets', 'go', 'ahead', 'throw', 'here', 'say', 'are', 'three', 'special', 'features', 'instead', 'two.The', 'next', 'feature', 'Textless', 'Openings', 'are', 'textless', 'versions', 'openings', 'appear', 'box', 'set', 'are', 'put', 'back-to-back', 'one', 'piece', 'However', 'textless', 'version', 'first', 'opening', 'already', 'appeared', 'box', 'set', 'third', 'season', 'seemed', 'rather', 'pointless', 'include', 'here', 'well.The', 'last', 'feature', 'Textless', 'Endings', 'Just', 'Textless', 'Openings', 'textless', 'versions', 'endings', 'appear', 'set', 'textless', 'version', 'first', 'ending', 'already', 'appeared', 'box', 'set', 'season', 'three', 'so', 'question', 'why', 'was', 'included.This', 'particular', 'season', 'Inuyasha', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'progress', 'story', 'much', 'episodes', 'were', 'entertaining', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'that', 'important', 'overall', 'story', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'especially', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'progression', 'took', 'place', 'third', 'season', 'lot', 'respects', 'fourth', 'season', 'Inuyasha', 'feels', 'more', 'filler', 'season', 'anything', 'else.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Inuyasha', 'want', 'have', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'then', 'need', 'acquire', 'set', 'However', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'convinced', 'particular', 'set', 'retail', 'price', 'writing', 'set', 'retailing', '90', 'same', 'price', 'first', 'three', 'sets']",Inuyasha - Season 4

Don't let that discourage you though the episodes are still entertaining to watch as you see Inu yasha and the gang try and find clues on Naraku's whereabouts and during their travels confront demons no longer afraid to show themselves since Naraku isn't around to absorb or destroy them, also you'll have the usual minor villains around trying to do their own vile plans that the hero's must defeat.  The animation is clean and clear with no complaints and as always the voice actors/actresses for both the Japanese and English cast did great,  the only thing I can find some fault in is the price I got this when it was on sale at a lower price and since I already had two dvds of the season I felt that it was a pretty good deal instead of buying the rest of the season one dvd at a time.  Some friends and people have asked is there a difference in video quality or audio with these box sets than the single dvds they've already bought?, and for that I would say no the video and audio are pretty much the same except that as expected the dvds of the box sets have more episodes on their dvds than the single dvds you separately.
