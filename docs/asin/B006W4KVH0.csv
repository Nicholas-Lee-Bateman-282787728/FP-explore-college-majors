So, of coarse, I probably did enjoy this movie more than a Twilight fan would.According to my fiance, it's almost word for word of the movie with jokes thrown in... it didn't look like it was going to be a funny movie, not after witnessing the opening scene which apparently is just like how the movie started, only it ended on a useless fart noise. It did get me laughing after that tho with some things that where just so over the top and stupid I couldn't help laughing and saying WTF? at the same time.I think the plot of it was something about new vampires coming to eat Bella and the Sparkling wimps and the Wolf Pac that pee on everything have to align together to protect her. that's about it, the rest is just nonsense and humor. Sure, not everything is funny, but it does have it's moments. What killed the movie in the end was during the closing credits it says it's dedicated to Twilight fans and shows clips of them watching trailers of it, which was both sad and annoying at the same time that people like that could be so obsessed with a movie.A couple of things in the movie could have been a lot funnier... like the fact that Edward is a vampire, and he has trouble getting an erection, but by the end of the movie he gets one... they should have stuck to the reality of the situation that IF a vampire could exist, he would have no blood in his body, therefor his heart wouldn't be pumping any bloody for him to even get an erection... I thought that was the angle they where going for, but no, they screwed it up and let him have one.They should have also kept going with the gags about Jacob peeing on everything, after all, he is a dog, and he's ""imprinting"" himself while watching a dog show on TV... which is porn to pups, that was funny, but not enough exploring that I don't think.Overall, rent it, or do the DL thing, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.

The movie is NOT a spoof on ""Breaking Dawn"" but rather a spoof on ""Eclipse."" ""Breaking Dawn"" is spoofed the last few minutes of the film. Breaking wind is something grossly associated with the wolves and Bella. It is overly used in the beginning of the film as well as the low brow sexual humor is excessive. There is a discussion of size of all the main characters sexual organs. ""Cavernous"" was used to describe Bella (Heather Ann Davis) who subscribes to ""Ebony Thunder"" magazine.Edward (Eric Callero) has some issues with sex that blue pills can't help. Frank Pacheco portrays a rather portly shirtless Jacob who engages in a lot of toilet, implanting, and marking territory humor.The overly excessive low brow humor diminishes to a tolerable level after Danny Trejo explains the story of the wolves and vampires. It is a humorous story, one I enjoyed as he confounds various movies into one tale. At this point the comedy becomes more of a real movie satire and relies less on cheap body part humor. I thought the actors played a good spoof role, although they should have done another take at the end with the child actors.The film is supposed to be campy, and had they started with Danny Trejo or redid the gross beginning, it would easily be 4 stars. The spoof of people's dislike for Bella's repulsive character did give me some LOL moments.As far as ""Twilight"" spoofs go, I would rank this above ""Taintlight"" but below ""Vampires Suck.""F-bomb, sex spoof including oral and descriptions of gay sex, drawn human body parts, and fake male organs.",3,"LINDSEY LOHAN, PING PONG BALLS, AND A MULE",1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,1683,"['title', 'containing', 'wit', 'wisdom', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'kept', 'expectations', 'exceedingly', 'low', 'i.e', 'Tempe', 'Video', 'level', 'movie', 'NOT', 'spoof', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'rather', 'spoof', 'Eclipse', 'Breaking', 'Dawn', 'spoofed', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'Breaking', 'wind', 'something', 'grossly', 'associated', 'wolves', 'Bella', 'overly', 'used', 'beginning', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'low', 'brow', 'sexual', 'humor', 'excessive', 'discussion', 'size', 'main', 'characters', 'sexual', 'organs', 'Cavernous', 'was', 'used', 'describe', 'Bella', 'Heather', 'Ann', 'Davis', 'who', 'subscribes', 'Ebony', 'Thunder', 'magazine.Edward', 'Eric', 'Callero', 'issues', 'sex', 'blue', 'pills', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'Frank', 'Pacheco', 'rather', 'portly', 'shirtless', 'Jacob', 'who', 'lot', 'toilet', 'implanting', 'marking', 'territory', 'humor.The', 'overly', 'excessive', 'low', 'brow', 'humor', 'diminishes', 'tolerable', 'level', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'story', 'wolves', 'vampires', 'humorous', 'story', 'one', 'enjoyed', 'various', 'movies', 'one', 'tale', 'point', 'comedy', 'more', 'real', 'movie', 'satire', 'relies', 'less', 'cheap', 'body', 'part', 'humor', 'thought', 'actors', 'played', 'good', 'spoof', 'role', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'take', 'end', 'child', 'actors.The', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'campy', 'had', 'started', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'redid', 'gross', 'beginning', 'would', 'easily', 'be', '4', 'stars', 'spoof', 'people', 'dislike', 'Bella', 'repulsive', 'character', 'did', 'give', 'LOL', 'moments.As', 'far', 'Twilight', 'spoofs', 'go', 'would', 'rank', 'Taintlight', 'Vampires', 'Suck', 'F-bomb', 'sex', 'spoof', 'including', 'oral', 'descriptions', 'gay', 'sex', 'drawn', 'human', 'body', 'parts', 'fake', 'male', 'organs']",Breaking Wind - The Unrated Director's Cut
