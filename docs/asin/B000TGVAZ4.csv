1090339,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,B000TGVAZ4,Carlisle Wheeling,"[2, 2]","If you find family sitcons either too tame and gushy (Step By Step) or too obnoxious (Married with Children), you just have to see this one, because it combines the elements of both extremes, then takes and makes a series in a league of its own.  Aimed quite apparently at adults my age, because we all know the 80s too well, and at their generation of kids, this has to be one of the funniest and most relatable shows on TV in a very long time.  Unfortunately, like so many others here, I never even heard of the series until it started being run religiously on Lifetime.  You want to talk about virtual gut-splitting laughter?  Then this show is one you have to see to believe.  Mark Addy is Bill Miller and Jami Gertz is his wife Judy.  They partied hard as kids in the 80s, and now they have two daughters and a son that they have to try and deal with whom they often embarrass and try not to come off sounding like hypocrites.  Well, they often do, and the kids seem to be better grounded than they are simply because they DO humiliate them.  It sounds awfully familiar, and that's the fertile playground the writers have to work with on this refreshing program.I love everything about this short-lived series, Bill's refusal to grow up, but still being likable and the fall-down funny for one.  Admit it; you knew lots of guys like him in high school, he looks like you would expect them to years later, and that's what really hits you where you live.  I have always liked Jami Gertz, and she shines as the equally crazy, but still downright cute Judy.  Then there are the kids:  Ryan who is scholarly, clean cut, and they always think he might be gay, though he's not.  Loren, a typical boy crazy teen who is always trying to break the rules and ending up being embarrassed the most, and Tina who is sometimes just a little creepy like Wednesday from the Adams family.  What's really funny is Judy's loser sister and her fiancee' with the fake British accent, his bad song lyrics, and his Foghat cover band.  A Foghat cover band?  LOL!Question:  How about it CBS?  Make these few seasons easier for us to obtain since you did the show such a disservice while it was still on the air so that many of us had to discover it in syndication.  Not since my beloved Wonder Years have I wanted the complete series of any other show.  I can't wait to introduce this underrated gem to new devotees, because it's worth watching over and over again.  If you haven't seen this show yet, you don't know what you're missing.  It's a definite keeper and deserves to be labelled as classic TV.",5,One of the Best Shows Not Enoough People  Were Watching!,1319932800,"10 30, 2011",2011,2583,"['find', 'family', 'sitcons', 'too', 'tame', 'gushy', 'Step', 'Step', 'too', 'obnoxious', 'Married', 'Children', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'one', 'elements', 'extremes', 'then', 'series', 'league', 'own', 'Aimed', 'quite', 'apparently', 'adults', 'age', 'know', '80s', 'too', 'well', 'generation', 'kids', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'most', 'relatable', 'shows', 'TV', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'here', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'series', 'started', 'being', 'run', 'religiously', 'Lifetime', 'want', 'talk', 'virtual', 'gut-splitting', 'laughter', 'Then', 'show', 'one', 'have', 'see', 'believe', 'Mark', 'Addy', 'Bill', 'Miller', 'Jami', 'Gertz', 'wife', 'Judy', 'partied', 'hard', 'kids', '80s', 'now', 'have', 'two', 'daughters', 'son', 'have', 'try', 'deal', 'whom', 'often', 'embarrass', 'try', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'sounding', 'hypocrites', 'Well', 'often', 'do', 'kids', 'seem', 'be', 'better', 'grounded', 'are', 'simply', 'DO', 'humiliate', 'awfully', 'familiar', 'fertile', 'writers', 'have', 'work', 'refreshing', 'program.I', 'everything', 'short-lived', 'series', 'Bill', 'refusal', 'grow', 'up', 'still', 'being', 'likable', 'fall-down', 'funny', 'one', 'Admit', 'knew', 'lots', 'guys', 'high', 'school', 'would', 'expect', 'years', 'later', 'what', 'really', 'where', 'live', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'Jami', 'Gertz', 'equally', 'crazy', 'still', 'downright', 'cute', 'Judy', 'Then', 'are', 'kids', 'Ryan', 'who', 'scholarly', 'clean', 'cut', 'always', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'gay', 'not', 'Loren', 'typical', 'boy', 'crazy', 'teen', 'who', 'always', 'trying', 'break', 'rules', 'ending', 'up', 'being', 'embarrassed', 'most', 'Tina', 'who', 'sometimes', 'just', 'little', 'creepy', 'Wednesday', 'Adams', 'family', 'What', 'really', 'funny', 'Judy', 'loser', 'sister', 'fiancee', 'fake', 'British', 'accent', 'bad', 'song', 'lyrics', 'Foghat', 'cover', 'band', 'Foghat', 'cover', 'band', 'LOL', 'Question', 'How', 'CBS', 'Make', 'few', 'seasons', 'easier', 'obtain', 'did', 'show', 'such', 'disservice', 'was', 'still', 'air', 'many', 'had', 'discover', 'syndication', 'Not', 'beloved', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'have', 'wanted', 'complete', 'series', 'other', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'introduce', 'underrated', 'gem', 'new', 'devotees', 'worth', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'missing', 'definite', 'keeper', 'be', 'labelled', 'classic', 'TV']",N/A
1090340,A2OTT4J4JLCL1G,B000TGVAZ4,"C. Gregory ""C. Gregory""","[2, 2]","I watched this show since it first aired, but I must have lost track of it the last season, as when I watched it in syndication I found episodes I didn't remember. CBS has a habit of taking off shows I love. They stick with crap but let the quality get away. Such shows as Out of Practice and Still Standing are far better than How I met your mother (how is that show even still on is beyond me) or the new adventures of Old Christine (or as I call it, Haven't we seen this already?). The cast of Still Standing and the writing are perfect. If a real network had been in charge maybe we could have gotten eight seasons instead of four. Just like with 3rd Rock from the Sun, this show ended entirely too early. When I was in the hospital for ten days the one thing that was a bright spot was I got to see this show in syndication (three times in a row). I have no clue why this isn't on dvd, while other shows are. I would not mind paying a bit extra to get a complete series either. I don't mind dropping the money for all four seasons at once. Everything about this show was so well done. The husband and wife (both great actors) seem like an ill-fated pair but they totally belong together. Some stupid critic was using this show as an example of how unattractive oafish men always seem to date hot younger women. When you see the interaction between these two you will see they were meant for each other. The characters are so much alike but in wildly different ways. They deserve each other, and you get the feeling the characters (as well as the actors) have fun with each other. This is a must have. I love quality tv and this show is definitely a must have for anyone who loves comedy. So I'll buy it as soon as it comes out. in whatever format it comes out in. That's the power of a great show...you're always willing to spend more time with it. It dates really well, and the humor is top notch, and just like with Cheers, the more you watch the better you are rewarded, as you'll get to know all the idiosyncrasies of each of the characters.

It is very funny, and the cast had a great chemistry with eachother, and even though the characters may have had trouble relating to eachother, and would slightly clash, they still had the love. Mark Addy is really over-looked; I think he's a great comedian, and I wish there was more with him in it. I honestly had never heard of him, until I saw this. I also would've never guessed that he was British. This is the type of laid back comedy that you can easily fit into your daily life, and can watch to unwind, or cheer yourself up if you're having a blah day. I've heard a couple compare it to other comedies with a thin wife, and chubby husband, but there really is much, much more to this nice little series than that!After I moved about a year ago, I was unable to get cable, and just had the option of expensive satelite, but after I realized ABC Family was cutting it down to just one episode in the morning, and possibly taking it off the air, I just got Netflix and Amazon Prime/instant video stuff with a Roku, as most of what I watched is on one or the other. But I can't seem to find this on any of those, or on DVD, which is too bad. I really hope it gets put on DVD. . I'd be the first to order it!

This was a surprisingly good TV show, and I am looking forward to buying the DVD set for the four years it was on the air.",5,"Took me a while, but now I love it!",1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,535,"['took', 'while', 'get', 'show', 'people', 'kept', 'comparing', 'show', 'family', 'took', 'offense..', 'first', 'Now', 'watch', 'laugh', 'night', 'show', 'so', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'casting', 'set', 'writers', 'are', 'brilliant', 'set', 'kind', 'reminded', 'Roseanne', 'course', 'characters', 'really', 'not', 'anything', 'Roseanne', 'once', 'get', 'understand', 'characters', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'TV', 'show', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'buying', 'DVD', 'set', 'four', 'years', 'was', 'air']",N/A

Am I confusing it with another show? The episode I recall was the episode when the ambigious son wanted to enter a dance contest with a male partenr.
