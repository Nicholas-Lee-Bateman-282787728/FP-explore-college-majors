351315,ATWTE9KHND8K8,6303025862,CJ,"[0, 0]","This is easily my favorite Chuck Norris movie and was the first one I saw.  I first watched it as a young lad on TV a few years after it had left the theaters and this began my major fascination with martial arts, along with the rest of America in the early '80s. Karate lessons, nunchucks, throwing stars, ninja outfits, LOL the whole 9 yards.  There is an appealing somber, vintage feel to the entire flick and this is the best example of Chuck as a competitive martial arts fighter as opposed to being a cowboy, cop, or other more obviously fictional characters. It's great fun to watch two highly trained, highly conditioned fighters like Chuck and the great Bill ""Superfoot"" Wallace fighting like modern day knights (stunning form from Bill during his high kicks).  Chuck is pure All American hero as usual and as a kid I instantly understood why he was so widely admired.  Bill does a great job of being the bad guy and gave the film edge where it could have otherwise fallen short.  The end fight sequence is still one of my favorites of all time, including the notorious conclusion.Another highly enjoyable Norris movie around this golden age for Norris fans was Silent Rage.  Pure candy to me as a kid. By the late '80s, his movies had less and less martial arts emphasis, so check out the early ones if you are into that aspect.",5,Prime Chuck,1342828800,"07 21, 2012",2012,1338,"['easily', 'favorite', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'saw', 'first', 'watched', 'young', 'lad', 'TV', 'few', 'years', 'had', 'left', 'theaters', 'began', 'major', 'fascination', 'martial', 'arts', 'rest', 'America', 'early', 'Karate', 'lessons', 'nunchucks', 'throwing', 'stars', 'ninja', 'outfits', 'LOL', 'whole', '9', 'yards', 'appealing', 'somber', 'vintage', 'feel', 'entire', 'flick', 'best', 'example', 'Chuck', 'competitive', 'martial', 'arts', 'fighter', 'opposed', 'being', 'cowboy', 'cop', 'other', 'more', 'obviously', 'fictional', 'characters', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'two', 'highly', 'trained', 'highly', 'conditioned', 'fighters', 'Chuck', 'great', 'Bill', 'Superfoot', 'Wallace', 'fighting', 'modern', 'day', 'knights', 'stunning', 'form', 'Bill', 'high', 'kicks', 'Chuck', 'pure', 'American', 'hero', 'usual', 'kid', 'instantly', 'understood', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'widely', 'admired', 'Bill', 'great', 'job', 'being', 'bad', 'guy', 'gave', 'film', 'edge', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'otherwise', 'fallen', 'short', 'end', 'fight', 'sequence', 'still', 'one', 'favorites', 'time', 'including', 'notorious', 'conclusion.Another', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'Norris', 'movie', 'golden', 'age', 'Norris', 'fans', 'was', 'Silent', 'Rage', 'Pure', 'candy', 'kid', 'late', ""'80s"", 'movies', 'had', 'less', 'less', 'martial', 'arts', 'emphasis', 'so', 'check', 'out', 'early', 'ones', 'are', 'aspect']",N/A

That's the tagline for the drama action thriller A Force of One (1979), starring Chuck Norris.  I have no idea what it means to `hear the silence', or `see the darkness', but I suppose it has something to do with being a karate man (martial artists in the late 70's apparently had yet to earn the distinction of being known as `martial artists', often referred to as `karate men', as illustrated within this film) ...or maybe some promotional person just thought it sounded cool.  While this wasn't Chuck Norris' first starring feature (most accept 1979's Good Guys Wear Black to have that distinction), it was the first, decent film he starred in, and, along with his ever growing fan base, helped turn this 6-time World Karate champion an internationally known film star.  Based on a story by Ernest Tidyman (Shaft, The French Connection), A Force of one was directed by Paul Aaron, whose previous credits at the time included A Different Story (1978) and the made for television version of The Miracle Worker (1979), starring Patty Duke.  The film stars Chuck Norris (Lone Wolf McQuade, Missing in Action 2: The Beginning) and the always-lovely Jennifer O'Neill (Summer of '42, Scanners) with one of the most unattractive, butch haircuts I've ever seen on a female.  Also appearing is Clu Gulager (The Last Picture Show), Ron O'Neal (Superfly, Red Dawn), and martial artist Bill `Superfoot' Wallace in his silver screen debut.The film takes place in a relatively small California community, which is being overrun by the drug trade.  As the film begins, we witness the death of two undercover detectives at the lethal hands of a mysterious, masked karate man.  The detectives were investigating a lead, and met their fate while searching a local business (without a search warrant, I might add...which happens a number of times throughout the film, leading me to believe California has some of the most lax search and seizure laws in the nation).  Anyway, the police are baffled by the deaths of two of their own, and soon come to the conclusion it must have been a karate man.  This prompts them to seek out local karate expert and trainer Matt Logan (Norris) not only for possible leads, but also for training.  Logan's hesitant to get involved, as he's busy training to defend his karate man title, but his conscience compels him, and he ends up helping out (which is good because everyone knows if you want to beat a karate man, you need a karate man).  This ends up leading to one of the more clich&eacute; plot devices in films, where the bad guys harm one of Logan's kin, so now it's personal, forcing Logan to issue the declaration I used for the title of my review.This wasn't a bad little independent action flick, certainly formulaic, aided marginally by some decent performances by O'Neill (the scene where she reacts to the deaths of a couple of colleagues was pretty strong) and even Norris himself (whom, incidentally got his training as an actor from Jonathan Harris, better known as Dr. Smith, from TV's Lost in Space).  Director Paul Aaron seemed like an odd choice, given his non-action film work, but he did reasonably well on all counts.  The supporting cast did well, but their characters weren't given a whole lot to work with, and it shows.  This is especially true of Gulager's character of Chief Dunne, who seemed to know very little about what his detectives were investigating, and so when they turned up dead, there were virtually no leads to follow...great job keeping track of your people...I guess keeping you informed, reporting in, calling for back up and such, wasn't a priority (neither was the appropriation of search warrants, but I already mentioned that).  I really liked the scenes where Norris' character is training the detectives in karate, as they provided a nice bit of levity in an otherwise a serious film.  I also enjoyed the interaction between Norris' character and that of his adopted son as it felt natural, despite the character of the son turning into an obvious plot device later in the film (he was also in danger of becoming a comic relief character, but thankfully it never crossed that threshold).  The real treat here is the fight scenes, choreographed by Norris himself and his younger brother Aaron.  There's a feel of realism that's sometimes lacking in other action films.  Director Aaron made a wise choice avoiding a lot of quick cuts and close-ups during these scenes, rather letting the scenes play out in lengthy wide shots.  And is it me, or does the head bad guy Melrose, played by actor Clint Ritchie, look a heck of a lot like Gil Gerard, from TV's Buck Rogers in the 25th Century?  And Melrose...if you're going to commit a crime, don't wear a t-shirt emblazoned with the logo of the store you work at while doing it (yeah, I know, he was wearing a blazer over it, but it was still visible)...The film on this DVD is presented in full screen, and the picture is sharp and clear.  I would have preferred the inclusion of a wide screen version, but what are you gonna do?  The audio came through clearly, and gives the option of 5.1 Dolby Digital, along with 2.0 Mono in English, Spanish, or French.  Special features include two featurettes titled `The Making of A Force of One' (16 min), and `How American Cinema Changed Hollywood Forever' (28 min) which details the rise and fall of American Cinema Group (the independent production company that originally released this film), and how their unique, innovative ideas and methods for making and marketing films eventually got co-opted by the larger studios, along with the company itself.  Also included are cast and crew bios, along with a trailer and television commercial for the film.Cookieman108",3,"""Whoever did this is as good as dead...""",1110844800,"03 15,

351317,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6303025862,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","It's Christmas time and drug trafficking is booming in sunny Santa Monica, California, and things come to a boil when undercover narcotics agents get their windpipes caved in during an investigation. SMPD's prevailing thought is that an expert at hand-to-hand combat must've done the killings, and so feelers are sent out to karate champion and instructor Matt Logan to see if he could teach karate to the narcotics squad as a protective measure. Matt is too busy training for a title bout, except that we all know he'll come around, especially when sexy narcotics cop Jennifer O'Neill comes knocking. Still, even with Matt Logan on board, the police force body count keeps mounting, thanks to the karate killer. And with all the top belts in town for Logan's upcoming match, there is simply no dearth of suspects.How do you solve the problem of a stiff lead actor? One way is to blanket him with a diverting supporting cast. That's how they rolled with Steven Seagal in his heyday. For Chuck Norris, the best example of putting interesting character actors around him is probably CODE OF SILENCE, but 1979's A FORCE OF ONE is a good one, also. Clu Gulager, Ron O'Neal (SUPER FLY), and Jennifer O'Neill lend grit and color to the bits of police drama. On the martial arts side of things Chuck's brother Aaron helps with the fight choreography and has a small part as an instructor in Matt Logan's karate school. There's that one really nice scene in which Chuck and Aaron instruct the cops in disarming an armed opponent. The cops come in sort of dismissive but they're soon getting thuddingly thrown around all over the place, to the extent that one jive cop finally declares to Chuck: ""Say, man, it's your world, you know what I mean?"" And, yes, mister, it is Chuck Norris's world.Also, Bill ""Superfoot"" Wallace comes in as Chuck's foil, and maybe it's a good bit of trivia that Wallace at the time was the real-life reigning middleweight karate champ. It's cheesy but also kind of neat that, in the final action set piece, ""Superfoot"" and Chuck engage in an officially sanctioned bout in the ring but then end up in a fight to the finish out in the streets. And while Chuck never took the world by storm with his delivery of a line, he looks very comfortable and natural in his scenes with Eric Laneuville, who plays Chuck's foster son. You really feel that Chuck means the hell out of it when he later vows grimly: ""Whoever did this... is as good as dead."" When he said that, I couldn't help but go, ""Oooh, someone's gonna a smackdown beatdown."" In Chuck's classic moments of badassery, this is almost on par with his reaction to Bruce Lee's ripping out tufts of his chest hair in THE WAY OF THE DRAGON.I'm actually surprised that this DVD comes with bonus material (from 2003): The ""Making Of"" documentary which offers interviews with cast & crew sans Chuck Norris (00:15:27 minutes long); ""How American Cinema Changed Hollywood Forever"" - a piece on the rise and fall of the American Cinema Group, an independent film distribution company which revolutionized how a film is marketed and which produced A FORCE OF ONE (00:27:56); brief cast & crew biographies; the theatrical trailer and a TV commercial promoting A FORCE OF ONE.

He basically plays a thinly disguised version of himself, and shows the qualities that would later make him a star. Although the plot's rather thin, there are some cool fight scenes in the movie, especially the climactic battle between Chuck and Bill &#34;Superfoot&#34; Wallace, who plays a heavy. The movie was obviously made on a shoe-string budget, so don't look too closely at the sets. A lot of the scenes look like they were filmed in one take or spliced together to extend the movie. One scene in which Chuck is working the over-under bag is repeated in two different places, and another one has Clu Gulagar wearing one of Chuck's fighting robes inside out to double as a bathrobe. The reverse lettering of Chuck's on-screen name, Matt Logan, is visible if you look. All things considered, the movie wasn't bad. Eric Laneuville is reunited with Chuck and shows off some of his martial arts skills that he apparently learned from Chuck in that old Room 222 episode. The performers gave the weak script (which was written by Shaft creator Ernest Tidyman) their all. James Whitmore, Jr., Ron &#34;Superfly&#34; O'Neal and Jennifer &#34;The Summer of 42&#34; O'Neil provide some credible acting to augment the rather wooden performances of the real-life karate stars who were just venturing into films at the time.

Karate expert Chuck Norris is called in to catch the killer and also to train the officers in karate.  Chuck Norris plays a kickboxer in the movie, and he finds out that his toughest oppenent in the ring is the karate killer the cops are looking for.  This leads to a showdown between Chuck Norris and the villain.  It starts in the ring, and ends out of the ring.Th final fight is extremely short and so are all the other fights.  I may be able to excuse the bad fight scenes if the story was good, but it isn't even close to good.  There isn't any development put into ANY of the characters and this is where the movie really fails.  The most enjoyment I got out of this movie was when it finally ended.1.5/5The DVD from Trinity Home Entertainment is full screen, but doesn't block out any of the action. Sound is good.There is a great 15 minute making of featurette that includes interviews with the president of American Cinema, the director of the movie, the composer, and many others.  One thing the director talks about is the casting.  Unfortunately he doesn't talk about casting Bill ""Superfoot"" Wallace as the villain.The other special feature is a 28 minute documentary on ""How American Cinema changed Hollywood forever"".  This talks about how Chuck Norris was the film company's main star and how their company got started.  It is the same documentary that is on Trinity's release ofThe Octagon",2,Chuck Norris in one of his lesser movies,1187222400,"08 16, 2007",2007,1537,"['police', 'have', 'seen', 'rise', 'drug', 'crimes', 'suspect', 'killer', 'trained', 'karate', 'killing', 'narcotics', 'officers', 'Karate', 'expert', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'called', 'catch', 'killer', 'also', 'train', 'officers', 'karate', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'kickboxer', 'movie', 'out', 'toughest', 'oppenent', 'ring', 'karate', 'killer', 'cops', 'are', 'looking', 'showdown', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'villain', 'ring', 'ring.Th', 'final', 'fight', 'extremely', 'short', 'so', 'are', 'other', 'fights', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'excuse', 'bad', 'fight', 'scenes', 'story', 'was', 'good', ""n't"", 'even', 'close', 'good', ""n't"", 'development', 'put', 'ANY', 'characters', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'most', 'enjoyment', 'got', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'finally', 'DVD', 'Trinity', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'full', 'screen', ""n't"", 'block', 'out', 'action', 'Sound', 'good.There', 'great', '15', 'minute', 'making', 'featurette', 'interviews', 'president', 'American', 'Cinema', 'director', 'movie', 'composer', 'many', 'others', 'One', 'thing', 'director', 'talks', 'casting', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'talk', 'casting', 'Bill', 'Superfoot', 'Wallace', 'villain.The', 'other', 'special', 'feature', '28', 'minute', 'documentary', 'How', 'American', 'Cinema', 'changed', 'Hollywood', 'forever', 'talks', 'how', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'was', 'film', 'company', 'main', 'star', 'how', 'company', 'got', 'started', 'same', 'documentary', 'Trinity', 'release', 'ofThe', 'Octagon']",N/A

He plays a champion karate instructor who's been asked to help teach self-defense classes to a class of police officers on the trail of a cop-killer they believe is a skilled martial artist.  There's fun dialogue (listen to that offscreen cop muse about baseball mit prices while he and his partner search for clues at a sporting goods store!), good fight scenes (Wallace's kicks and Norris's spinning back fist look very sharp during the tournament matches), involving scenes of suspense (run, Charlie, run!), and Chuck dialogue at its best (""Whoever did this, is as good as dead."")  It's got a low budget feel (because it WAS a low budget pic) with some extended long shots (not a lot of different camera angles and fancy framing), but that adds a little realistic touch and some extra charm to the film as well.  Highly recommended for fans of Chuck!  (Other top-notch Chuck Norris films would be CODE OF SILENCE and WAY OF THE DRAGON-also known as RETURN OF THE DRAGON.  And I also recommend SLAUGHTER IN SAN FRANSISCO which is a REALLY low budget Hong Kong movie starring Don Wong-also known as Wong Dao-where mouths don't match the words and Chuck plays a really good bad guy!)",3,One of Chuck's Best!,1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,1213,"['one', 'Chuck', 'best', 'champion', 'karate', 'instructor', 'who', 'been', 'asked', 'help', 'teach', 'self-defense', 'classes', 'class', 'police', 'officers', 'trail', 'cop-killer', 'believe', 'skilled', 'martial', 'artist', 'fun', 'dialogue', 'listen', 'offscreen', 'cop', 'muse', 'baseball', 'mit', 'prices', 'partner', 'search', 'clues', 'sporting', 'goods', 'store', 'good', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Wallace', 'kicks', 'Norris', 'spinning', 'back', 'fist', 'look', 'very', 'sharp', 'tournament', 'matches', 'involving', 'scenes', 'suspense', 'run', 'Charlie', 'run', 'Chuck', 'dialogue', 'best', 'Whoever', 'did', 'as', 'good', 'dead', 'got', 'low', 'budget', 'feel', 'WAS', 'low', 'budget', 'pic', 'extended', 'long', 'shots', 'not', 'lot', 'different', 'camera', 'angles', 'fancy', 'framing', 'little', 'realistic', 'touch', 'extra', 'charm', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'Chuck', 'Other', 'top-notch', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'CODE', 'OF', 'SILENCE', 'WAY', 'THE', 'DRAGON-also', 'known', 'RETURN', 'THE', 'DRAGON', 'also', 'recommend', 'SLAUGHTER', 'IN', 'SAN', 'FRANSISCO', 'REALLY', 'low', 'budget', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'movie', 'starring', 'Don', 'Wong-also', 'known', 'Wong', 'Dao-where', 'mouths', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'words', 'Chuck', 'really', 'good', 'bad', 'guy']",N/A
