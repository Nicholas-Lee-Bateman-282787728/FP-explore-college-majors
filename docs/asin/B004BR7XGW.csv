1395526,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004BR7XGW,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[20, 24]","Is it possible to have a frothy romantic sex comedy with characters that have very few redeeming features?  I guess ""The People I've Slept With"" makes the case that it is, indeed, possible.  But is it prudent?  Attempting to be a pleasing romp, the film presents two lead characters that I did not like at all.  That's fine in some cases, I appreciate an antihero or jerk as much as the next guy (probably more).  In this type of comedy, however, you're supposed to be charmed and amused by the lead's antics and I simply found them distasteful and insufferable.  With a plot straight out of a film two decades ago, ""The People I've Slept With"" highlights a world of irresponsibility and promiscuity.  Strangely, the most traumatic thing that may happen in this life of meaningless and random sexual encounters is an unwanted pregnancy (okay, maybe the plot is from 30 years ago).  Of course, life lessons are to be learned as selfishness gives way to elements of maturity--but by that time, this was already a lost cause for me.  As I didn't like the principles, I didn't much care about their journey and the slight redemption was purely by necessity, not by any great character insight.Karin Anna Cheung plays the lead and when she discovers that she's got a bun in the oven, she must uncover which of her sexual encounters is responsible.  Enlisting the help of her equally self-involved gay pal (Wilson Cruz), there is much hilarity as the two condescendingly judge the less than ideal candidates.  With Cruz, who is cheating in his own relationship, the duo of losers act as if they are the prize to be won in any scenario.  Ironically, Archie Kao, Randall Park and Rane Jameson are all far more appealing than our main characters.  Kao is Cheung's primary suitor, a charming politician that defies all conventional stereotypes.  Why this successful, attractive, intelligent and wealthy suitor would fall for our promiscuous booty call is a bit mystifying.  Park plays a real object of derision to our sniping leads because he's boring.  But he pursues Cheung with a relentless hilarity that provides the film's comic highpoints.  And Jameson is sweetness and calm as he puts up with Cruz's wolfish ways.  All three deserve much better than to be saddled with either Cheung or Cruz.Performance-wise, Cheung seems a capable and appealing actress and I've followed Cruz since ""My So-Called Life.""  It is the screenplay that sets up the limitations of the story.  I appreciate that many people may really like ""The People I've Slept With"" for its unorthodox subject matter.  But the film wants it both ways.  It sets up its characters with a freedom and recklessness and rebelliousness to conventional standards.  Their perceived superiority is absolutely believable in people of a certain age.  But when the film attempts to connect on an emotional level, I didn't believe it for one minute.  The film strives for a pathos at the end to elicit genuine emotion from its audience, but by that time--my hard heart was immune to these characters and it fell flat.

It is like a huge tasteless, obnoxious, layered cliche cake with cliche frosting and cliche sprinkled on top. What's worse is that these cliches aren't just tacky but offensive as they are often stereotypical of certain groups.See if you can count the cliches in the plot: It's about a woman who is out to sow her ""wild oats"" and accidentally gets pregnant while doing so and wishes to find out the identity of the baby's father. She keeps a kind of ""score card"" with pics and descriptions of all her bed mates. She has a gay best friend that is very promiscuous and has problems with commitment, a conservative sister with a ""perfect family,"" and an elderly dad with a girlfriend that is her age. The woman finally meets the man of her dreams but he is from a very strict Asian family and associated problems ensue.

This Asian American movie seemed either a hit or a miss with most people.After I watched this movie I thought it was a hit. I liked it because it was hilarious to watch. Plenty of good jokes to keep me watching. Most of the jokes would be sexual in nature, but you could had already guessed that from the title of the movie. lolI thought the story was quiet original and I have never seen this type of movie. I heard about it in real life, but never seen a movie made and finally I found one. Besides the main story line, this movie has a gay love story as well. I'm okay with that because I have many gay friends and I know some of them actually do look for love instead of sex all of the time. This movie was right on when I saw that in the movie.The only thing I didn't like about the movie was at the end, where you don't actually find out who is the father of her baby. Yes, it pretty obvious, whom the father is and I know that. But, I have an issue with that as well. I'm one of those people that need to actually see or hear it for confirmation. It wouldn't be just this movie too. I hate every movie that does that.
