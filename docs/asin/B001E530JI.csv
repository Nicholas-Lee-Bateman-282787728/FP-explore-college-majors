Sure back in the day he might have been considered heavy, but in modern times he'd blend in just fine. Seriously, have you been to Milwaukee lately? How about Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Chicago or anywhere they sell ""real""(as in cooked with lard) grits? This poor guy was a drop in the fry grease bucket compared to what we got walking around out there nowadays. There should be more Frank Cannon spin-offs on TV now than there are for CSI or Law & Orders!I liked old Frank. I especially liked how, to compensate for the fact that he was never gonna chase anyone on foot, the writers would add in a chase scene where a criminal on foot is chased down by Cannon in his huge monster car. Then instead of tackling the bad guy he smacks him with the car door, or on a good night, actually runs the bad guy down! WHEEEEOOO! That was fun! And remember how they had to imply the love scenes with the ladies, cuz nobody wanted to see THAT, and even though it was only hinted at the actresses still looked really uncomfortable. It's hard to believe that when he shot this show he was a mere 22 years old.I really appreciated this show because at the time I was a bit of a stout lad myself and it was nice to see someone like me up there on the small screen. Frank never let his weight get in his way (except when he was looking for his weener) and that was something I admired. Where are the heroic, smart chubbies of today? We don't have any. Instead one of our most popular TV shows is about real life fatties who need to make a public spectacle of themselves to lose weight! They sit there and bawl for an hour while an angry she-male yells at them.We need more shows like this one. Well written dramas, whether they are detective, doctor, lawyer or anything else are like the canaries in the mine shaft.

1184533,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001E530JI,trebe,"[7, 8]","William Conrad, got his first lead in a television series in 1971, as an ex-LA cop turned private eye, Frank Cannon.  At the time, police and crime dramas were big, and were about to explode in popularity.  Following in the wake of late 60's programs like Dragnet, Mannix, Colombo, The Mod Squad, Adam-12, and Ironside (just to name a few), Cannon was part of the early wave of a genre that would soon flood the airwaves in the 70's.  A Quinn-Martin Production, the program has the familiar basic packaging of the company's previous prime time successes, The Fugitive, The FBI, and The Invaders.Bill Conrad was a big man, an obvious fact that the series' writers made a point of emphasis, and humor, for the character Frank Cannon.  They put Conrad's obesity out in the open, with frequent references his size and weight, or being on a diet.  Cannon blames himself for his weight problem, and being something of a gourmet cook, doesn't make things any easier.  It all seems unkind, but this was a different era, and Bill Conrad appears to have taken it all in stride.  He may not have had the ideal body type, but Conrad was certainly up to the physical demands of being the lead in an action series.  There are plenty of fights, chases, shootouts, and car crashes, and Mr. Conrad proves to be very light on his feet, and quite a scrapper, with the muscle power to fling attackers around with ease.Among the highlights in the second half of the first season, are `A Flight of Hawks"", where Cannon is hired by an insurance company to look into the death of a man killed in a car wreck.  The investigation leads to a group of mercenaries.  Cannon is quite impressive, assembling and firing a machine gun, then challenging a P51 Mustang fighter plane.  It's not realistic, but it sure is fun.  In `The Torch', Cannon investigates a fire that claims a life.  Anthony Zerbe impresses playing a high tech expert in arson, who gets tangled up in murder.  `The Island Caper' provides a change of pace, as Cannon is sent to a tropical island to check into the security of a bank.  In `Flight Plan', Cannon is hired by a devious and ruthless criminal (Cesare Danova), who wants to disappear, and nearly falls victim to his own ingenuity.Smart, capable, tough as iron, and big of heart, Frank Cannon is a true pro, who operates with a unique flair.  Conrad brings humanity and warmth to the character, which is a plus, as the writing is generally adequate, rather than outstanding, and Conrad's ability to win the audience over with charm and humor helps make some of the weaker stories still pretty enjoyable.William Conrad, who had a long career in films and television as an actor, director, and producer, got his start in radio.  With a powerful and distinctive voice, he was Marshall Matt Dillon on the long running radio serial version of Gunsmoke, and appeared in thousands of other radio dramas.  He also did narration for numerous films, and television productions like The Fugitive, as well as voice work for cartoons like Rocky and Bullwinkle.  He was posthumously elected to the Radio Hall of Fame, in 1997.  Besides Cannon, Conrad also starred in the television series Nero Wolf, and Jake and the Fat Man.  This very talented man, passed away in 1994 at the age of 73.",3,"""...don't ever ask a man that looks like me, if he knows what it means to let himself go""(Frank Cannon in 'Flight Plan')",1239408000,"04 11, 2009",2009,3270,"['William', 'Conrad', 'got', 'first', 'lead', 'television', 'series', '1971', 'ex-LA', 'cop', 'turned', 'private', 'eye', 'Frank', 'Cannon', 'time', 'police', 'crime', 'dramas', 'were', 'big', 'were', 'about', 'explode', 'popularity', 'Following', 'wake', 'late', '60', 'programs', 'Dragnet', 'Mannix', 'Colombo', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'Adam-12', 'Ironside', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'Cannon', 'was', 'part', 'early', 'wave', 'genre', 'would', 'soon', 'flood', 'airwaves', '70', 'Quinn-Martin', 'Production', 'program', 'familiar', 'basic', 'packaging', 'company', 'previous', 'prime', 'time', 'successes', 'Fugitive', 'FBI', 'Invaders.Bill', 'Conrad', 'was', 'big', 'man', 'obvious', 'fact', 'series', 'writers', 'made', 'point', 'emphasis', 'humor', 'character', 'Frank', 'Cannon', 'put', 'Conrad', 'obesity', 'out', 'open', 'frequent', 'references', 'size', 'weight', 'being', 'diet', 'Cannon', 'weight', 'problem', 'being', 'something', 'gourmet', 'cook', ""n't"", 'make', 'things', 'easier', 'unkind', 'was', 'different', 'era', 'Bill', 'Conrad', 'have', 'taken', 'stride', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'ideal', 'body', 'type', 'Conrad', 'was', 'certainly', 'up', 'physical', 'demands', 'being', 'lead', 'action', 'series', 'are', 'plenty', 'fights', 'chases', 'shootouts', 'car', 'crashes', 'Mr.', 'Conrad', 'be', 'very', 'light', 'feet', 'quite', 'scrapper', 'muscle', 'power', 'fling', 'attackers', 'ease.Among', 'highlights', 'second', 'half', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'Flight', 'Hawks', 'where', 'Cannon', 'hired', 'insurance', 'company', 'look', 'death', 'man', 'killed', 'car', 'wreck', 'investigation', 'group', 'mercenaries', 'Cannon', 'quite', 'impressive', 'assembling', 'firing', 'machine', 'gun', 'then', 'challenging', 'P51', 'Mustang', 'fighter', 'plane', 'not', 'realistic', 'sure', 'fun', 'Torch', 'Cannon', 'fire', 'life', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'playing', 'high', 'tech', 'expert', 'arson', 'who', 'tangled', 'up', 'murder', 'Island', 'Caper', 'change', 'pace', 'Cannon', 'sent', 'tropical', 'island', 'check', 'security', 'bank', 'Flight', 'Plan', 'Cannon', 'hired', 'devious', 'ruthless', 'criminal', 'Cesare', 'Danova', 'who', 'disappear', 'nearly', 'victim', 'own', 'ingenuity.Smart', 'capable', 'tough', 'iron', 'big', 'heart', 'Frank', 'Cannon', 'true', 'pro', 'who', 'unique', 'flair', 'Conrad', 'humanity', 'warmth', 'character', 'plus', 'writing', 'generally', 'adequate', 'rather', 'outstanding', 'Conrad', 'ability', 'win', 'audience', 'charm', 'humor', 'helps', 'make', 'weaker', 'stories', 'still', 'pretty', 'enjoyable.William', 'Conrad', 'who', 'had', 'long', 'career', 'films', 'television', 'actor', 'director', 'producer', 'got', 'start', 'radio', 'powerful', 'distinctive', 'voice', 'was', 'Marshall', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'long', 'running', 'radio', 'serial', 'version', 'Gunsmoke', 'appeared', 'thousands', 'other', 'radio', 'dramas', 'also', 'did', 'narration', 'numerous', 'films', 'television', 'productions', 'Fugitive', 'as', 'well', 'voice', 'work', 'cartoons', 'Rocky', 'Bullwinkle', 'was', 'posthumously', 'elected', 'Radio', 'Hall', 'Fame', '1997', 'Cannon', 'Conrad', 'also', 'starred', 'television', 'series', 'Nero', 'Wolf', 'Jake', 'Fat', 'Man', 'very', 'talented', 'man', 'passed', 'away', '1994', 'age', '73']","Cannon - Season One, Vols. 1-2"
