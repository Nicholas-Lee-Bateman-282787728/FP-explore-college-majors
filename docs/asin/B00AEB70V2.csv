1607821,A3IN2WR1OYWJTT,B00AEB70V2,"Keri Teach ""Seaviewkat""","[0, 0]","While I am still waiting to receive the last movie I purchased here on Amazon, with the addition of the two I own on Instant Stream in my movie library, I also own all the rest of the series on DVD. I have seen all 8 of the Jesse Stone movies on Netflix and the Hallmark Channel on cable TV. The picture clarity of the DVD's are far superb to what I've seen on cable. The first thing that appeals to me about this series is of course that it stars Tom Selleck , who currently stars in the CBS series ""Blue Bloods"" which in recent months has completed it's third season and has been renewed to begin it's fourth season on Friday nights this fall and another long running CBS-TV series which most of his fans are familiar with ""Magnum PI"". Selleck has also starred in several films for the big screen ""Three Men and a Baby"", the sequel ""Three Men and a Little Lady"", ""Runaway"", and ""Her Alibi"" to name a few. Selleck not only stars in the Jesse Stone movies as the central character, he is also the producer so consequently these movies have top notch casting and the performances are excellent. In particular Viola Davis who I've seen on numerous ""Law and Order"" episodes playing one of those defense attorneys we all love to hate but here she is cast in a much more likable character as Molly and is part of the Paradise Police department. She forms quite an attachment to the Jesse, the Chief of Police, and provides good moral support when appropriate. I love the scene where she goes into the boys restroom at the local high school after one of three gang rapists of a fellow female student, the way she apprehends the teen is priceless. He is one of those kids of upper society families in Paradise and thinks he doesn't have to pay attention to any authority type. The boys father is just as bad and another great scene is when the father insults the rape victim at the police station in front of Jesse and the victims father, the victims father jumps up and punches out the teen for insulting his daughter and when the boys father attempts to confront the victims father he also proceeds to punch him out and next you see him taking on both the obnoxious father and son...then at the right moment Jesse Stone calms the girls dad down and has him take a seat. When the dad of the boy starts to yell about getting his lawyer and having the other dad charged with assaulting him and his son, when he tells Jesse he is a witness for his assault case, Jesse sides the victom and her dad and the teen rapist is put in a holding cell. Jesse Stone was hired by the town council for Paradise and in a meeting they tell him that he could be better utilizing his people and resources to solve a series of mysterious shootings. When Jesse tells them he's been a cop for a number of years and knows how to work the case, the council implies they can fire him. Jesse's reply, ""you can fire me but you can't tell me what to do."" It's not long before Jesse knows who is responsible for committing the murders including his pal, a lawyer for the DA, now he must gather the evidence needed to apprehend the killers. ""Stone Cold"" is a very taught, well written, and acted story and Tom Selleck as Jesse Stone doesn't miss a mark. This movie as with all the movies in this series keep your interest from beginning to end. There are many other excellent actors in the series. I have never read the books but after watching this series I just might have to read the books...books usually have far more detail than what you see in the finished movie. Tom Selleck is excellent as Jesse Stone. I had so hoped that we would see another movie added to the series but perhaps the last movie ""Benefit Of The Doubt"" is the end or maybe Tom Selleck felt he wasn't able to squeeze in the time to shoot another movie with his busy schedule doing""Blue Bloods"". In any case these are movies that I like to pull out and will watch again and again over time. Each time you see these movies you see something new that you missed the time before. Jesse Stone is a very comfortable character for Tom Selleck and Tom Selleck is very comfortable in the role of Jesse Stone. These movies made for CBS-TV are all top quality and a definite must see if you like crime drama's and especially if you are a fan of Tom Selleck. Something added with the DVD that you won't see on any of the pay services on the DVD ""Stone Cold"" there is a featurette ""Beneath the Surface of ""Stone Cold"" which gives some interesting background on the making of the first movie in the series and the cast that appears in this excellent movie.",5,Jesse Stone Movie Collection is a must have for collectors and Tom Selleck

1607822,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00AEB70V2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[39, 39]","Note: A brief mention about pricing.  While it's great to get all eight of the Jesse Stone films together in one convenient shipment, many have been around at bargain pricing for years.  You may want to do a bit of shopping for a price configuration that makes sense to you if the ask here seems a little high.Included:2005: Stone Cold2006: Night Passage2006: Death In Paradise2007: Sea Change2009: Thin Ice2010: No Remorse2011: Innocents lost2012: Benefit Of The DoubtTom Selleck is Jesse Stone! I don't know who author Robert B. Parker might have envisioned inhabiting his iconic small town police chief, but Selleck has certainly owned and perfected the role over the course of these 8 made-for-TV movies. Stone must surely be one of the most laid back heroes to ever grace the small screen and Selleck has perfected the minimalism necessary to make this character stand out. In the film world of quick cut editing, these films defy expectation by unfolding at a very leisurely pace. For the most part, the mysteries place a distant second in importance to the characterizations and the humor developed in the scripts (for which Parker does share a writer's credit). For the Stone series to be successful, you've got to care about the principals. So while Selleck is as comfortable as an old slipper in his role, it is also important to single out the recurring cast that helps to sell these tidy mysteries. With stellar talents like Viola Davis, William Devane and Kathy Baker providing back-up (not to mention a quietly impressive Kohl Sudduth or a pretty cool dog), it's easy to become invested in this small community of characters no matter what challenge they're faced to solved.Starting with 2005's ""Stone Cold"" through 2012's ""Benefit of the Doubt,"" each of the eight films obviously has its own central plot and mystery. While the earlier films are probably regarded as stronger entries plot-wise, I do think each chapter has enough to recommend it on its own merits. You'll appreciate the films to varying degrees as with any serialization.  Some you may love, some just like. The series gets progressively more introspective.  Some of the later entries have enormous sections with very little dialogue.  However, to my way of thinking, what has made this series terrific is the continuing back story and its respect to the characters. Jesse Stone and team have evolved through the years and their interactions, relationships and growth in the totality of these eight films is what is so very special.In truth, there is nothing necessarily ground-breaking here. Just old pros putting on some great entertainment. Lacking hysterics and over-the-top action set pieces, the Jesse Stone series is a quietly compelling throw-back to when stories and people mattered more than special effects. And, as always, the icing on the cake is the pitch perfect Tom Selleck who paints Jesse as both lovable and excruciatingly frustrating. It may be his best role ever, so it's no surprise he's come back 8 times! Enjoy.
