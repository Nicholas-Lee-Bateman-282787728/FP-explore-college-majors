624199,ASR6EDD3ES7JW,B00005JMYI,,"[3, 3]","How rare it is when we get a comedy like this. I actually did not see Anchorman in the theaters, passing it by, thinking it was just one of those stupid crude, anti-women movies that focus all on sexual humor. Well two years later my friend sat me down in front of the TV on a rainy afternoon and we watched Anchorman on HBO. I was immensely surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. It's that type of humor you have to understand to like--humor you find in movies such as Nacho Libre and Dumb and Dumber. You have to sit down and watch it with a complete open mind, because if you're expecting some genius great comedy movie, prepare yourself for a huge disappointment. I wasn't expecting a great comedy movie, and the humor is that stupid humor that makes you laugh harder than a solid, real comedy film. The acting is both great and hilarious with a side-splittingly hysterical role by Steve Carell and smart, classy roles by Ferrell and Applegate. It even features a hell of a lot of celebrity cameos, including Jack Black and Luke Wilson. And the best part about this movie? It gets FUNNIER AND FUNNIER every time you see it, until the point where you helplessly burst out laughing when you see the DVD on a shelf in Blockbuster. And then there's no turning back.

When he talks it is hilarious... he can take the most mundane word and make it absolutely the funniest thing you have ever heard!!  I have heard alot people say the movie was way over done... like the fight scene, but the movie made fun of itself...now how great is that.  After the over done and elaborate fight scene Ron and the gang are just sitting in his office making fun of the whole scene in a great sarcastic tone.  People didn't get it.. my friends didn't...they thought it was stupid but it was supposed to be.  They even made that known during the movie!

This IS the uncut version, so maybe the theatrical cut was more even, but this version has some scenes that just seem pointless.  The beginning of the film contains a warning saying that this is the uncut version and contains nudity, but honestly, there's no nudity in this film, and in fact, I didn't understand what made this film ""uncut"" at all -- there wasn't anything racier in this that you wouldn't find in any other ""R"" rated comedy.  The only thing ""uncut"" about this film seemed to be all of the pointless material that seemed like IT SHOULD have been cut!Anyway, the film in a nutshell is as follows: Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) and his news team are the tops in town.  It's the 70's, and TV news is an all-boys club -- until Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) comes to town.There are 2 really funny scenes that make this film worth at least a rental.  In one, Burgundy and his news team face off in what is essentially a gang fight with several other local news teams.  This is followed by another very funny scene in which Burgundy and his news team sit around and discuss the fight that just took place.  Especially funny is weatherman ""Brick"", played by that guy who plays the boss on NBC's trainwreck remake of BBC's ""The Office"".",3,"Half of it is funny, the other half needs editing...a lot of editing",1123286400,"08 6, 2005",2005,1403,"['When', 'saw', 'ads', 'film', 'expected', 'be', 'hillarious', 'other', 'half', 'film', 'sore', 'need', 'editing', 'uncut', 'version', 'so', 'maybe', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'was', 'more', 'even', 'version', 'scenes', 'just', 'seem', 'pointless', 'beginning', 'film', 'warning', 'saying', 'uncut', 'version', 'nudity', 'honestly', 'nudity', 'film', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'made', 'film', 'uncut', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'racier', 'would', ""n't"", 'find', 'other', 'R', 'rated', 'comedy', 'only', 'thing', 'uncut', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'pointless', 'material', 'seemed', 'IT', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'Anyway', 'film', 'nutshell', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'news', 'team', 'are', 'tops', 'town', '70', 'TV', 'news', 'all-boys', 'club', 'Veronica', 'Corningstone', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'are', '2', 'really', 'funny', 'scenes', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'least', 'rental', 'one', 'Burgundy', 'news', 'team', 'face', 'what', 'essentially', 'gang', 'fight', 'several', 'other', 'local', 'news', 'teams', 'followed', 'very', 'funny', 'scene', 'Burgundy', 'news', 'team', 'sit', 'discuss', 'fight', 'just', 'took', 'place', 'Especially', 'funny', 'weatherman', 'Brick', 'played', 'guy', 'who', 'boss', 'NBC', 'trainwreck', 'remake', 'BBC', 'Office']",Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy

While it's not a comdey classic, it is a entertaining time to spend when you have a few hours to spare.The plot focuses around the Channel 4 News studio and the hijinks that occur after a woman is hired as a correspondant. The leading News Anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is quickly smitten with the new newswoman. And hilarity ensues.The character that produces the biggest laughs would have to be Brick, played by Steve Carrell. Will Ferrell deffinitly has his moments as well.While a few of the jokes are lame and don't get across, most of it is simple, harmless, and fun. If you are looking for something with a little more depth, this probably is not for you.

That's not just Will Ferrell, but Christina Appelgate, Fred Willard  and Steve Corell from Comedy Central's Daily Show.  Separately, they've each made their own success in past roles but here in Anchorman they're a comic force ad libbing their way through a script that sets an already impressive foundation.  I nearly cracked in half a few times.The premise is, what was it like that historic day in the `70s when the first woman went in front of the camera, not as a cheesecake weather girl but as a serious reporter?  The all-male news team reacts with the predictable; attempts to sabotage her with innuendo and psychological warfare, seduction, immature jokes.  The sort of stuff that happens any time a woman ""invades"" a male-dominated field.  Only Veronica (the much-underrated Christina Applegate) handles it all with a bemused tolerance and class.  Nothing could bring her down, that is, until the impossible happened...she falls for Ron Burgundy.  Ron, the living stereotype of chauvinism and a Jr. High Schoolboy mentality, is lonely underneath all of his unqualified success as a tv news anchor.  Can love temper their differences and bridge the gap between the sexes?I think that what makes Anchorman work is an underlying glee at lampooning the self-important, phony airs put on by talking head all over the country.  In every well-modulated tone, every pretentious turn of phrase and every carefully choreographed inflection we can see the Channel Four News Team's hilarious, accurate mimicry. The entire cast has it down perfectly.  We instinctively recognize that it's a delicious send-up of the so-called journalists we are familiar with as a television audience.Then again, if you don't watch the news on television you probably won't get half of the in-jokes.  That would explain *some* people's reactions, but...A niggling thought occurs:  could it be that Anchorman's detractors were uncomfortably reminded of their own behavior at times?  Really and truly folks, the film's message about `70s sexism was delivered with lightheartedness, gently, and with no righteous fury whatsoever.  And yet, some people may take even the lightest poke as a full frontal assault.  A case of a guilty conscience making for a sensitive viewer, perhaps?In any case, I plead with you not to allow a few negative comments from other reviewers to keep you from seeing what I think may be the funniest film of 2004.-Andrea, aka Merribelle.",5,My pick for best comedy of 2004.,1105228800,"01 9, 2005",2005,2550,"['way', 'cast', 'funniest', 'comedic', 'actors', 'new', 'century', 'could', 'fail', 'not', 'just', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Christina', 'Appelgate', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'Steve', 'Corell', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'Daily', 'Show', 'Separately', ""'ve"", 'made', 'own', 'success', 'past', 'roles', 'here', 'Anchorman', ""'re"", 'comic', 'force', 'ad', 'libbing', 'way', 'script', 'already', 'impressive', 'foundation', 'nearly', 'cracked', 'few', 'times.The', 'premise', 'what', 'was', 'historic', 'day', '70s', 'when', 'first', 'woman', 'went', 'front', 'camera', 'not', 'cheesecake', 'weather', 'girl', 'serious', 'reporter', 'all-male', 'news', 'team', 'predictable', 'attempts', 'sabotage', 'innuendo', 'psychological', 'warfare', 'seduction', 'immature', 'jokes', 'sort', 'stuff', 'time', 'woman', 'invades', 'male-dominated', 'field', 'Only', 'Veronica', 'much-underrated', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'bemused', 'tolerance', 'class', 'Nothing', 'could', 'bring', 'down', 'impossible', 'happened', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'Ron', 'living', 'stereotype', 'chauvinism', 'Jr.', 'High', 'Schoolboy', 'mentality', 'lonely', 'unqualified', 'success', 'tv', 'news', 'anchor', 'Can', 'love', 'temper', 'differences', 'bridge', 'gap', 'sexes', 'think', 'what', 'Anchorman', 'work', 'underlying', 'glee', 'lampooning', 'self-important', 'phony', 'airs', 'put', 'talking', 'head', 'country', 'well-modulated', 'tone', 'pretentious', 'turn', 'phrase', 'carefully', 'choreographed', 'inflection', 'can', 'see', 'Channel', 'Four', 'News', 'Team', 'hilarious', 'accurate', 'mimicry', 'entire', 'cast', 'down', 'perfectly', 'instinctively', 'recognize', 'delicious', 'send-up', 'so-called', 'journalists', 'are', 'familiar', 'television', 'audience.Then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'news', 'television', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'half', 'in-jokes', 'would', 'explain', '*some*', 'people', 'reactions', 'A', 'niggling', 'thought', 'occurs', 'could', 'be', 'Anchorman', 'detractors', 'were', 'uncomfortably', 'reminded', 'own', 'behavior', 'times', 'Really', 'truly', 'folks', 'film', 'message', '70s', 'sexism', 'was', 'delivered', 'lightheartedness', 'gently', 'righteous', 'fury', 'whatsoever', 'yet', 'people', 'may', 'take', 'even', 'lightest', 'poke', 'full', 'frontal', 'assault', 'case', 'guilty', 'conscience', 'making', 'sensitive', 'viewer', 'perhaps', 'case', 'plead', 'not', 'allow', 'few', 'negative', 'comments', 'other', 'reviewers', 'keep', 'seeing', 'what', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'funniest', 'film', '2004.-Andrea', 'aka', 'Merribelle']",Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy

And what exactly do they say to each other when they break for commercial and we can't hear what they say?. Or when it's over and the credits roll?. Well, we find out here, and it's one of a number of deliriously silly and funny moments that fill up this goofy, but funny satire. Will Ferrell, who can do no wrong by this reviewer, continues his streak of making funny, enjoyable little pieces of comedy fluff. This is probably his most inspired creation so far. The film is narrated by Bill Kurtis, an A&E staple who hosts such shows as ""Cold Case Files"", and ""American Justice"". Will plays Ron Burgundy, a local 1970's anchorman in San Diego(or San Diago as he has called it), who seems to be riding high on all fronts. He is an insanely childish and pompous, and the lights are pretty dim in that well coiffed melon of his. He's treated like an important celebrity(or at least he think he is)and he is living the high life. Along with his buddies. Champ Kind(David Koechner), is the cowboy hat wearing sports guy, and has an unhealthy interest in Ron. Roving reporter Brian Fontana(Paul Rudd), is the big mustached ladies man. And then there is weatherman Brick Tamland(the hilarious Steve Carrel), a simpleton who has been declared ""mentally retarded"". The guys' male dominated lifestyle and world is shaken up when the station hires Veronica Corningstone(Christina Applegate), a hot young lady who aspires to be a top anchor herself, and throwing a wrench in what the men, and life at that time in general, thought of as an ""only men"" kind of thing. A time when women didn't have the power they have now. When they were assistants or secreteries, and were seldom seen, and heard even less. As the movie shows it as being. Once she arrives, the comedy really kicks in, especially when the two result to petty pranks and name calling to make it to the top. The always great Fred Willard co-stars as the station's boss. There is no great plot or meaning here, except for Will and the gang to have fun with their characters and make a silly little comedy that is only meant for pure fun and entertainment. They succeeded. It is no surprise that Applegate is funny and holds her own. She practically comes from an entire life of comedy, and her ditzy work as Kelly Bundy on ""Married With Children"" was an inspired bit of comedy buffoonery acting, and was not appreciated in the right way. She has come a long way from that role with tons of other parts since then. Ferrell is the kind of comedian who will just jump right in there and do it. No matter what. Burgundy can get a bit tiring after a while, but he is always ready to pull you back in with a funny line or scene. Carrel, as Brick, gets the most laughs here. There is a great scene where our reporters are confronted by the other channel's news teams in a hilarious ""battle"" scene. The moment is only made better because of the cameo appearances from stars who plays the other top anchors. I won't say who. That will spoil the fun. The design of the film works real well and has that 70's look and vibe, and the outfits and facial hair are hysterical. As is the use of The Starlight Vocal Band's hit, ""Afternoon Delight"". The DVD claims it is the unrated, unedited version, but I never saw the original theatrical release, so I couldn't tell you what is newly put in and what is there. The special features are a delight. There are bloopers, which can also be found during the end credits, and outtakes, and lots more. Plus a hilarious video of the already mentioned song above. Bill Kurtis himself appears in a feature that has him having a 10 minute talk with Ron Burgundy. All in all, it's a riotously silly and cheeseball comedy that will leave you with nothing more than a smile on your face and the knowing that you saw a completely mindless film that only wanted to have fun for an hour and a half.

One part that just topped on the annoyance scale, were the appearances of Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson.  It was like the cast of Old School reunited (another movie I was not thrilled with).

Also, I liked the supporting cast with Paul Rudd, Steve Carrell, David Koechner, and Fred Willard. Well, the first time I watched it, I got about 20 minutes into it, and popped it out of my DVD player. Didn't care for it, didn't particularly find it very funny. I was pretty disappointed.Then I let a couple of friends watch it. They watched it while I was in adjacent room, working on a project for work. And they pretty much laughed throughout the entire movie. Laughed HARD. I couldn't figure out what they were laughing at, as I sure didn't expect them to find it as amusing as they did. One of them said it was the funniest movie he had seen in years!Well, now, I had to give this movie another shot. I'm glad I did. Little did I know; what a hilarious movie! I found myself laughing so I hard I literally hurt! I don't know whether it was just kind of slow in the beginning, or I really didn't have my mind on it, or what. I think a lot of people who didn't like the movie did like I did the first time I saw it, and gave up on it much too early. This is destined to become a cult classic, believe me!

624245,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00005JMYI,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[6, 13]","`Anchorman, The Legend of Ron Burgundy' (the unrated version) cowritten by and starring Will Ferrell is a sophomoric comedy based on one idea borrowed from the very rich plot of `Broadcast News', spiked with some tired themes the character Ted Baxter of the Mary Tyler Moore Show plus some other borrowings from less likely sources such as `Monty Python and the Holy Grail'.For starters, I simply did not laugh at this movie. Not once! It was less funny to me than a Three Stooges short, and I don't like the Three Stooges. This is not to say I don't appreciate some good potty humor now and then. I happen to think that Kevin Smith's foul-mouthed marathons such as `Dogma' and `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' are really very, very funny.One of the most deadly aspects of the movie was that it was predictable. You can see punchlines coming from two blocks away. Even the crudest, cheapest gag / shock value in the movie which involved Burgundy's small, much beloved dog being kicked off the highest point of the high bridge over San Diego bay could be anticipated, as improbable as cruelty to animals scenes are in movies. The fact that the canine body falling to San Diego bay was so obviously a dummy dog neither improved the comedy nor took the sting out of the cheapness of the business.Ferrell has had a fair amount of success since he left Saturday Night Live and many, including Kevin Smith attest to his comedic abilities, but I just don't see it. I watched `Elf' a few months ago and I could appreciate that it was a better than average Christmas movie, but it really wasn't anything special. I just don't think Ferrell has the kind of natural comedic talent of people like Billy Crystal or Dan Aykroyd, let alone the comic geniuses like Jim Carrey, Bill Murray, and Robin Williams. Carrey and even Williams can sometimes become parodies of themselves, but the lapses usually don't last too long, and in any given 5 minutes on the screen they will get a laugh out of you by hook or by crook.There are many ways in which this is not a really bad movie. It probably is no less a cartoon of its subject than `Zoolander' or `Animal', but it is neither laugh out loud funny like `Garfield' nor `wryly funny like `Doonesbury'. The only character in the movie for which I had any sympathy at all was the news director played by Fred Willard. Ferrell's foil, the female newscaster played by Christina Applegate was too predictable and unnatural to elicit much empathy from me, especially since her competition was so artificial.If a movie is good, I typically rate DVDs on the basis of the quality of the bonus features. This is why a Kevin Smith DVD is such a good bargain compared to even great classic comedy DVDs such as `Ghostbusters' or `Some Like It Hot'. If the principals are not around to provide a good commentary, the rewatchability drops a bit. But this movie is not entertaining to begin with, so what interest do I have in listening to a commentary of why they decided to punt a dog dummy off the San Diego bridge.This movie may be worth a rent, but not a buy.",3,Average Comedy.

624250,ATC2WM08ZF9C1,B00005JMYI,book worm,"[2, 7]","Will Ferrell ruins it for this movie which has a great story idea. Most of Ferrell's comedy routines are no better than immature adolescent antics that are not at all funny and any man taken off the street can act better than he can. That being said, I do not understand how with his lack of abilities he is given the star role in this movie. I also find it ironic that Will Ferrell plays a news anchorman who is not willing to share his anchor desk with a newcomer newswoman, played superbly by Christina Applegate, and like the movie, Will Ferrell is apparently not willing to share the leading role in this movie with Christina Applegate. Applegate is way more funnier than Ferrell, and is a much better actor. This movie is really about her character's story, her struggle to make it as anchorwoman in a world not that long ago where women were not believed to be as smart as men. This movie should have devoted more time on Applegate's character, rather than filling dead time with Ferrell's stupid pranks and follies. I fail to see why the movie is centered around a no-talent like Will Ferrell whose character is not even pivotal in the plot and would have been more effective as a supporting role.Big thumbs down on Will Ferrell; big thumbs up for Christina Applegate.",3,Will Ferrell is So Not Funny,1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,1276,"['Will', 'Ferrell', 'movie', 'great', 'story', 'idea', 'Most', 'Ferrell', 'comedy', 'routines', 'are', 'better', 'immature', 'adolescent', 'antics', 'are', 'not', 'funny', 'man', 'taken', 'off', 'street', 'can', 'act', 'better', 'can', 'being', 'said', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'lack', 'abilities', 'given', 'star', 'role', 'movie', 'also', 'find', 'ironic', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'news', 'anchorman', 'who', 'not', 'willing', 'share', 'anchor', 'desk', 'newcomer', 'newswoman', 'played', 'superbly', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'movie', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'apparently', 'not', 'willing', 'share', 'leading', 'role', 'movie', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'Applegate', 'way', 'more', 'funnier', 'Ferrell', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'movie', 'really', 'character', 'story', 'struggle', 'make', 'anchorwoman', 'world', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'where', 'women', 'were', 'not', 'believed', 'be', 'as', 'smart', 'men', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'devoted', 'more', 'time', 'Applegate', 'character', 'rather', 'filling', 'dead', 'time', 'Ferrell', 'stupid', 'pranks', 'follies', 'fail', 'see', 'why', 'movie', 'centered', 'no-talent', 'like', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'character', 'not', 'even', 'pivotal', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'supporting', 'role.Big', 'thumbs', 'down', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'big', 'thumbs', 'up', 'Christina', 'Applegate']",Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy

But I sincerely do not know what is more irritating, the comedy of Will Ferrell, or writing a review of the comedy of Will Ferrell? I am just baffled over how anybody can find humor in his pathetically self-referential, needy, loud, annoying & repetitious shtick.My friend says that people dislike him because he has perfected playing an @$$ hole. On many occasions Martin Short also had this perfection....and was able to make it funny. Why do I get the feeling that acting like an @$$ hole is not so much of a personal stretch for Ferrell. People point to the success of the first ""Ron Burgundy"" film. This was in large part due to Christina Applegate and luckily for ""Ron Burgundy 2"" he has Appelgate, Paul Rudd & Steve Carrell to help prop it up.Ferrell topped Forbes Magazine ""Most Overpaid Actors"" list two (recent) years in a row. They do a straight forward ratio of Actor salary to box office. For every dollar Ferrell earns in salary his movies earn $ 3.29. Now compare this to Shia LeBouf whose movies return $ 160.00 for every dollar he is salaried.But comparing these two actors is not completely fair. It does not factor in what I will call the ""Transformers"" effect. Ferrell is working in comedy where Shia LeBouf has had the benefit of a couple massive sci-fi summer ""tent pole"" movies. So I decided to check further. Last year IMDB (cthejtheizzo - 29 Mar 2012) came out with its ""50 Highest Grossing Comedy Films of All Time"":Now one way to look at this list is to acknowledge that Ferrel has 3 movies on it. (#13 Elf, #23 Talledega Nights and #44 Blades of Glory) Another way to look at it is that Ferrel has ONLY 3 films on this list. (Robert De Niro had four) And even more telling was those films that came in before his...""Austin Powers"" before ""Elf""...""Wild Hogs"" before ""Taladega Nights""....""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"" way before ""Blades of Glory"".Another nationally syndicated columnist (Liz Braun) opinioned: ""Ferrell's biggest claim to fame, as far as we can make out, is that unlike other 'funny' people, he doesn't even try to hide his contempt for you."" She goes on to mention how Ferrel ""seems to have perfected the art of not being funny"".

624255,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005JMYI,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[3, 9]","This movie, starring Will Farrell in the main role, is a weak attempt at comedy from director Adam McKay. As much as I like Farrell from his Saturday Night Live days, this movie is a little too juvenile in humor and plot to make it a good comedy.Farrell and his female co- star Christina Applegate fight for attention in this film as they battle it out for the role as lead anchor on the local news. Farrell has held this role on the news for many years and doesn't want to relinquish his position to a woman. The movie is set in the 1970's- a time of feminism and social revolution- and the rivalry turns into a battle of the sexes between the two adults. This is a pretty standard movie formula and it could have worked better if the writing was more engaging and the comedy more sincere.The humor in this film is mostly bathroom- style and the jokes are primarily the types that appeal to younger kids. There isn't much in the way of original comedy, and what little originality the film can muster up is still juvenile and silly. In a matter of seconds, most of us could think of jokes and general humor at least as good as that offered here in Anchorman.Will Farrell is good in this role, and I liked Applegate. The addition of Fred Willard to the cast was also a good idea, but I would have liked it if Willard had a greater role. The other supporting cast of goons is rather lame and I can think of many actors/actresses who could have done just as well. On the other hand, the script of this film makes it tough for anyone to perform very well.Overall, Anchorman is a movie to pass on unless you're in the mood for this type of brainless comedy. Maybe if I had been in a more giddy disposition from the start, I would have liked this film more than I did.

And he capitalisized box-office-wise to great effect by assuming this 'anchorman of anchormen' lead.  Two Thumbs Up!  Way Up!  Hadn't laughed this hard since Tanya Harding used her Kerrigan knee-capper in a 'Colder Than Ice Cold' failed attempt at smut.  Christina Applegate did a fine job.  No, that's selling her short - she was titillatingly splendid.  Steve Carell's IQ may have escaped him in this flick, but it barely showed....oh alright, even the polar bear club would have demanded photo ID plus background check.  Very funny movie!  Ferrel drunk at the bar doing his best Ted Kasinsky drowning in a cesspool of his own frustration was a hoot.  Thanks to all involved with the film, for I can now in good faith point to my 'Pattern in the Pleats' as explanation for all misgivings/shortcomings.A quick word on what it takes to emulate Ronald Burgundy's lavish workplace know-how:If one owns many leather bound books, a next logical step would be 'Become local television news host/anchor.'  That's all it takes folks.  Books bounded by sweet/sweat scented leather - questionably recycled hooker boots and bum chaps shall not count on account of the smell-factor which cannot be discarded duefully nor outrightly - are your ticket to a rusted tinsle town.  Yes, at this stage you can earnestly make claim of possessing 'The Right Stuff' 'The Mack Skills' 'The Dim Wits of Reporter Tradition'.  Albeit critical acclaim/acknowledgement along the fine-lines of 'Big phony lacking belly laugh believability' and 'Such a Dullard the viewing audience can't help but contemplate belly laughing' is yet far off.  Needn't fret!  Those goods will come with the baggage - the hag seated next to you learned this lesson decades earlier dating your arrival when her rocky on-scene update covering the local brothel revealed an all too familiar name in the scandalous brouhaha's late 60's archives (here's inserted name of whomever your local coanchor happens to be - sexual status irrelevant).  And you thought their constant brooding on set week-in-week-out was senility in practice!  You see, Ron Burgundy took his notes on the fly, but from birth he surpassed you and I.  His books were leather bound.  Are yours?  Shouldn't they be?  Will you ever initiate jotting down post-birth guiding notes?  We can't all be Ron Burgundy at the anchor chair, but the sooner the better, trust me.  Paperback wasn't invented in his day - then again the cover's consistency didn't seem to hinder Ron's competency level one iota.  'Go Frick Yourselves San Diego' is prime evidence of just that.  C'mon future anchor persons, if you're gonna be so brash as to convince yourself of the futility of preparatory prime time area news greetings & salutations, well, please 'Go Frick Yourselves.'  I don't want my progeny staring bleary-eyed numbskullish at your drivel spewing robotically programmed remote controlled psychobabble frequented freakishly lip sticked yapper (is that lip stick I spot on two front yellow speckled teeth/mischisled dentures?) - especially when the little diablos could at the snap of my butler's fingers swiftly switch the channel and tune in to Ronny Boy Burgundy! - or the likes of his ilk.  I want my seed edumacated, NOT mentally emaciated via verbally lackluster 'And here's the news good people' fantasmagorical shoot-yourself-in-both-feet-put-yourself-in-a-stranglehold-pinch-your-brain-borefests!  Why can't you lie to me straightfaced?  Everybody else does.  Getting away with it isn't a grand challenge.  Ron Burgundy should serve as your prima donna anchor (man over board) archetype - follow not your heart but Ronald 'big lights' Burgundy in all sincere endeavor.

624261,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00005JMYI,Caleb Williams,"[4, 4]","Anchorman is a film that only comes around once every decade or so and it sets the standard for any comedies to follow. Arguably being Will Ferrells best it's a film with very ridiculous comedy moments brought together in an extremely intelligent way. It's not something where the jokes are reeled off one by one in an in obvious way, in fact some of the more funny jokes you can miss the first time round as they're very subtle. Along with Will Ferrell this film has a very strong supporting cast with people like Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and Christina Applegate. They give us a great blend of serious acting with very, very silly humour. I'm not usually a fan of the silly comedy movies and I'm sure a lot of people will shy away from it because it looks just that, however, it's something that will surpass all expectations and then some.Anchorman tells the story of 1970s San Diego news Anchor Ron Burgundy and his time as the most respected Anchorman in the San Diego area. Him and his team, Brian Fantana (Rudd), Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) & Champ Kind (David Koechner) are brought into peril when an aspiring woman Anchor is brought into the team. Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) is brought into the news office due to complaints of lack of diversity. This woman is strong and no matter how hard the main news team will try, she's not going to be put off from her goal to be Anchorwoman. Ron manages to use his charm and his ability to play the Jazz Flute (No Inuendo intended) to win over Veronica and they end up dating. She wants to keep it quiet because it will peril her career, but Ron being a mans man tells San Diego live on air that they're sleeping together. Through another series of unfortunate events Ron Burgundys dog baxter is killed leading to him being late for newscast. Seizing her chance, Veronica takes charge and becomes Anchorwoman for the one show to the dismay of Ron. Because she was so successful she is promoted to co-anchor and the relationship is off.I'm tempted to tell you the entire story but I wont. It is awesome though and is one of the most bizarre, childish and intelligent comedies I've ever seen. People would try to knock this film slightly by saying it's not as funny as his prior film, Old School but it's definitely much much funnier. The over the top acting of Ferrell is worth it alone as I could watch him in his outrageous emotional state after Baxter was killed, all day. Steve Carell is also another shining light in the film as he plays the dumb weather guy who's the over the top idiot that comes out with hysterically stupid things. ""I stabbed a guy in the heart"" the way he said it has to be witnessed as it's just classic Carell.One of my favourite lines from the movie which occurred in the opening credits as it was just so unexpected and very very silly. ""The human torch was denied a bank loan"" is an absolute classic which I think many people will agree with. Also the fight between the different channels news teams is also a classic as it features cameos from one of the greatest comic actors in Ben Stiller as the Spanish language news Anchor. I could honestly go on and on about how crazily funny this film is but I would give everything away. All I can say to wrap this up is you will need to watch it more than once in order to catch all the jokes as some you will miss the first time around.",5,One Of The Greatest Comedies Ever Made,1227398400,"11 23, 2008",2008,3378,"['Anchorman', 'film', 'only', 'around', 'once', 'decade', 'so', 'standard', 'comedies', 'follow', 'Arguably', 'being', 'Will', 'Ferrells', 'best', 'film', 'very', 'ridiculous', 'comedy', 'moments', 'brought', 'together', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'way', 'not', 'something', 'where', 'jokes', 'are', 'reeled', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'obvious', 'way', 'fact', 'more', 'funny', 'jokes', 'can', 'miss', 'first', 'time', 'round', ""'re"", 'very', 'subtle', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'film', 'very', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'people', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'give', 'great', 'blend', 'serious', 'acting', 'very', 'very', 'silly', 'humour', ""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'fan', 'silly', 'comedy', 'movies', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'shy', 'away', 'just', 'however', 'something', 'will', 'surpass', 'expectations', 'then', 'some.Anchorman', 'story', '1970s', 'San', 'Diego', 'news', 'Anchor', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'time', 'most', 'respected', 'Anchorman', 'San', 'Diego', 'area', 'Him', 'team', 'Brian', 'Fantana', 'Rudd', 'Brick', 'Tamland', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Champ', 'Kind', 'David', 'Koechner', 'are', 'brought', 'peril', 'when', 'aspiring', 'woman', 'Anchor', 'brought', 'team', 'Veronica', 'Corningstone', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'brought', 'news', 'office', 'due', 'complaints', 'lack', 'diversity', 'woman', 'strong', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'main', 'news', 'team', 'will', 'try', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'goal', 'be', 'Anchorwoman', 'Ron', 'use', 'charm', 'ability', 'play', 'Jazz', 'Flute', 'No', 'Inuendo', 'intended', 'win', 'Veronica', 'end', 'up', 'dating', 'keep', 'quiet', 'will', 'peril', 'career', 'Ron', 'being', 'mans', 'man', 'San', 'Diego', 'live', 'air', ""'re"", 'sleeping', 'together', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'Ron', 'Burgundys', 'dog', 'baxter', 'killed', 'leading', 'being', 'late', 'newscast', 'Seizing', 'chance', 'Veronica', 'charge', 'Anchorwoman', 'one', 'show', 'dismay', 'Ron', 'was', 'so', 'successful', 'promoted', 'co-anchor', 'relationship', 'off.I', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'tell', 'entire', 'story', 'wont', 'awesome', 'one', 'most', 'bizarre', 'childish', 'intelligent', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'People', 'would', 'try', 'knock', 'film', 'slightly', 'saying', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'prior', 'film', 'Old', 'School', 'definitely', 'much', 'much', 'funnier', 'top', 'acting', 'Ferrell', 'alone', 'could', 'watch', 'outrageous', 'emotional', 'state', 'Baxter', 'was', 'killed', 'day', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'also', 'shining', 'light', 'film', 'dumb', 'weather', 'guy', 'who', 'top', 'idiot', 'out', 'hysterically', 'stupid', 'things', 'stabbed', 'guy', 'heart', 'way', 'said', 'be', 'witnessed', 'just', 'classic', 'Carell.One', 'favourite', 'lines', 'movie', 'occurred', 'opening', 'credits', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'unexpected', 'very', 'very', 'silly', 'human', 'torch', 'was', 'denied', 'bank', 'loan', 'absolute', 'classic', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'agree', 'Also', 'fight', 'different', 'channels', 'news', 'teams', 'also', 'classic', 'cameos', 'one', 'greatest', 'comic', 'actors', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Spanish', 'language', 'news', 'Anchor', 'could', 'honestly', 'go', 'how', 'crazily', 'funny', 'film', 'would', 'give', 'everything', 'away', 'can', 'say', 'wrap', 'up', 'will', 'need', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'order', 'catch', 'jokes', 'will', 'miss', 'first', 'time', 'around']",Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 2]","Anchorman: The Legend of Ron BurgundyReleased on July 9, 2004Written by Will Ferrell and Adam McKayDirected by Adam McKayAnchorman is a very funny movie, but it is inconsistent in tone. They do anything for a laugh, and ad libbing was encouraged by director Adam McKay, but it often veers off track, and the story is pretty stupid. It just doesn't make sense, half the time. That being said, it has some of the funniest scenes ever filmed, and I'm sure there were a lot of laughs, on screen and off.It begins with the following narration, spoken by announcer Bill Lawson: ""There was a time, a time before cable. When the local anchorman reigned supreme. When people believed everything they heard on TV. This was an age when only men were allowed to read the news. And in San Diego, one anchorman was more man then the rest. His name was Ron Burgundy. He was like a god walking amongst mere mortals. He had a voice that could make a wolverine purr and suits so fine they made Sinatra look like a hobo. In other words, Ron Burgundy was the balls.""There is the movie in a nutshell. It is very funny in spurts, but spins out of control just as often. The problem is that the funniest parts could also be the out of control ones. Will Ferrell is excellent as Ron Burgundy, all empty headed and puffed up with self importance. There are great scenes of the news team doing the purposeful walk, wearing 70s style suits, it is so right on and true to the period.Another problem is the theme of a woman breaking into the male dominated world of TV News. It tries to be too PC, and that gets in the way of the comedy. Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) doesn't know if she wants to play it as a professional or a conniving slattern. Does she loath Ron Burgundy or love him? If she is as intelligent as she appears, then how could she love someone as ignorant as Burgundy? Should the movie mock her, or should it just mock Ron and the other male chauvinists?I like the part where Ron Burgundy comes home and talks to his dog, Baxter. Also outstanding was the scene where Ron Burgundy jams at a jazz club with his flute. There is a running gag where the other news teams rumble, and one of them gets his arm ripped off. Later, when everyone is trying to cover the Panda being born at the San Diego Zoo, he is shown with one arm. I just wish they could have shown as much care for the other plot lines that led nowhere.I want to emphasize that I think this is a very funny movie, and I recommend it, but it gets silly at times. There are some very funny people in it. Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Steve Carrell, Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Fred Armisen, Vince Vaughn, Fred Willard, Owen Wilson, and Chris Parnell, as well as co-anchors Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate. Four of them have double L's in their names.Good Night, San Diego, Stay Classy.",5,& You Thought San Diego was what you got when you dropped a waffle on the beach...,1180828800,"06 3, 2007",2007,2845,"['Anchorman', 'Legend', 'Ron', 'BurgundyReleased', 'July', '9', '2004Written', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Adam', 'McKayDirected', 'Adam', 'McKayAnchorman', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'inconsistent', 'tone', 'do', 'anything', 'laugh', 'ad', 'libbing', 'was', 'encouraged', 'director', 'Adam', 'McKay', 'often', 'off', 'track', 'story', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'time', 'being', 'said', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'ever', 'filmed', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'lot', 'laughs', 'screen', 'off.It', 'following', 'narration', 'spoken', 'announcer', 'Bill', 'Lawson', 'was', 'time', 'time', 'cable', 'When', 'local', 'anchorman', 'reigned', 'supreme', 'When', 'people', 'believed', 'everything', 'heard', 'TV', 'was', 'age', 'when', 'only', 'men', 'were', 'allowed', 'read', 'news', 'San', 'Diego', 'one', 'anchorman', 'was', 'more', 'man', 'then', 'rest', 'name', 'was', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'was', 'god', 'walking', 'amongst', 'mere', 'mortals', 'had', 'voice', 'could', 'make', 'wolverine', 'purr', 'suits', 'so', 'fine', 'made', 'Sinatra', 'look', 'hobo', 'other', 'words', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'was', 'balls', 'movie', 'nutshell', 'very', 'funny', 'spurts', 'control', 'just', 'as', 'often', 'problem', 'funniest', 'parts', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'out', 'control', 'ones', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'excellent', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'empty', 'headed', 'puffed', 'up', 'self', 'importance', 'are', 'great', 'scenes', 'news', 'team', 'doing', 'purposeful', 'walk', 'wearing', '70s', 'style', 'suits', 'so', 'right', 'true', 'period.Another', 'problem', 'theme', 'woman', 'breaking', 'male', 'dominated', 'world', 'TV', 'News', 'be', 'too', 'PC', 'way', 'comedy', 'Veronica', 'Corningstone', 'Christina', 'Applegate', ""n't"", 'know', 'play', 'professional', 'conniving', 'slattern', 'loath', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'love', 'as', 'intelligent', 'then', 'how', 'could', 'love', 'someone', 'as', 'ignorant', 'Burgundy', 'Should', 'movie', 'mock', 'should', 'just', 'mock', 'Ron', 'other', 'male', 'chauvinists', 'part', 'where', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'home', 'talks', 'dog', 'Baxter', 'Also', 'outstanding', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'jams', 'jazz', 'club', 'flute', 'running', 'gag', 'where', 'other', 'news', 'teams', 'rumble', 'one', 'arm', 'ripped', 'off', 'Later', 'when', 'everyone', 'trying', 'cover', 'Panda', 'being', 'born', 'San', 'Diego', 'Zoo', 'shown', 'one', 'arm', 'just', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'much', 'care', 'other', 'plot', 'lines', 'led', 'nowhere.I', 'want', 'emphasize', 'think', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'recommend', 'silly', 'times', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'people', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'David', 'Koechner', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Fred', 'Armisen', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Chris', 'Parnell', 'as', 'well', 'co-anchors', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'Four', 'have', 'double', 'L', 'names.Good', 'Night', 'San', 'Diego', 'Stay', 'Classy']",Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy

624277,A33IZJVCKFKDPU,B00005JMYI,Chris,"[1, 6]","Will Ferrell is probably the hottest and most in demand comedian in movies right now and deservingly of course.  He is an amazingly funny person.  He just sends of that impression of being an old creepy guy that uses stupid pick-up lines on girls and tries to hang out with the younger crowd.  Almost anything that he does turns out funny.  Well, except for this movie.Anchorman is about a new anchorman named Ron Burgundy (Ferrell).  His station is the number 1 rated news broadcast in the San Diego area.  Ron Burgundy is a sexist, extremely cocky person who is always trying to hook up with girls by saying ""You know, I am famous.""  Along with the rest of his news team, all of them being male, they strut around town and are well known by everyone.  Well, the management at Channel 4, Ron's station, decides that they need a change and hire a female news reporter.  This does not sit well with Ron and the rest of the news team.  So after a brief relationship with the new female broadcaster (Christina Applegate), Ron decides to try to destroy her career.  This backfires against him and he becomes scum and then rises back to the top.  Enough said.Now don't get me wrong, this movie had its funny moments.  The cameos by Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and Jack Black (whose cameo turned out to be the funniest moment of the movie) were really good.  Steve Carrell was the funniest of Burgundy's news team.  The problem is that the movie felt like a really long SNL skit that started to get old after about 20 minutes.  During most of the movie, the audience was not laughing.  The movie had a lot of dry parts and moved at a much slower pace then, say, Dodgeball.

624278,A5L5ITYHNCJYL,B00005JMYI,"Chris Honaker ""reviewman""","[1, 4]","I have to agree with many reviewers on this movie in that it wasn't that entertaining to watch. I think that's pretty sad when you watch and see good actors like Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins are in this movie (although they didn't have any big role). Ferrell is the San Diego anchorman Ron Burgundy who is the number one anchorman in the city and lives up to the superstar fame. Watching him was almost like watching al bundy from married with children as he appeared to be nothing more than a bum. It seemed like all Ron could do really well is read off what he saw on the screen and try to make it sound interesting. The whole news cast was very cocky and arrogant as they felt that noone could stop them. There was one hilarous scene that involved four other local news team meeting up in an alley and trying to patch up their difference in bloody war which ends up killing a few people and cutting off some body parts which was pretty much the only real funny scene in the movie. Of course, things change whenVeronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) arrives and is looking to be an anchorman herself. Of course, she would have her work cut out for her as a newsroom of predominate males felt that it wasn't designed for a woman. Even though she probably thought it was wrong, she falls head over heels over Ron when they hook up at a nightclub and shows off his other talent by playing the flute. Things would eventually change when Ron showed up late for work and Veronica filled in for him. Ron is furious and shows his male ego which irriates Veronica and ends the relationship. However, Veronica decided to not stop there and she publicly humilated Ron and caused him to get fired when she changed up some of the words on the screen. Without a job and the whole city ticked off at him for his words on the air, Ron hit deep depression. Now the news channel is concerned as now all the other local stations can now have a shot at competiting with them. However, Veronica does go the extra mile to try and bring Ron back. Ron must convince his staff who no longer worked for the news channel. Eventually, the group does get back together in time to cover a huge story at the zoo which the other four local news teams were trying to get the big scope on. Ron ends up saving Veronica from become the lunch of a tiger and saved the news team. The two ended up renewing their relationship and were co-anchors.

In Anchorman, his world is invaded by an ambitious woman with dreams of her own for the anchor position, and Ron doesn't quite know how to react. On the one hand, he is helplessly drawn to her beauty, but on the other, he is threatened, as no woman has ever been a news anchor before, and Burgundy doesn't want to look like a softie to the other news teams in the city.To analyze Anchorman as a film would be foolish, as it is a movie designed to entertain with laughs, not encourage deep thought. It succeeds in delivering the laughs, though I did take issue with some of the more over-the-top elements, which, while providing perhaps the biggest laughs in the movie - such as the news team rumble - were out of place with the rest of the film, which at times was a very effective satire of television news reporters.Will Ferrell does a great job as Ron Burgundy in a winning comedic turn, and Christina Applegate proves to be a wonderful foil for him as Veronica Corningstone. There are a few surprise cameos that I will not reveal; some were funnier than others.I've been known to say that I would be entertained by Will Ferrell dancing on screen with a broomstick for two hours. In Anchorman, Ferrell doesn't get that chance, but the movie is still entertaining enough to warrant a hearty recommendation.

624289,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00005JMYI,Craig MACKINNON,"[1, 2]","It occured to me after watching this film that Will Farrell is probably a great comedian because he says SO much that some of it is bound to be funny.  It is then up to his directors and editors to trim out what doesn't work and leave in the good parts.  For the most part, they succeed in Anchorman - the Legend of Ron Burgandy.  Both Farrell and his male castmates embody their stereotypical parts.  The actors bring enough new life to the stereotypes that we immediately recognise the characters, while still being able to surprise and entertain (rather than bore) us.  Christina Applegate has the unenviable task of being the ""straight man,"" but pulls it off and even gets some great comedic moments herself.  She is, I think, the key to making the film work - a central realism around which the waves of absurdity crash - much like Graham Chapman in the Monty Python movies.No, I don't mean to say that Anchorman is a ground-breaking or paradigm-shifting film - it is not Monty Python, Airplane, or There's Something About Mary.  At best, it's a minor comedy, but there are more laughs in it than in the entire Adam Sandler catalogue.  Or, for that matter, in all of Will Ferrell's SNL skits (the Jeopardy parodies excepted, of course).  The story: The four stooges of Channel 4's news team - the top 6-o'clock news show in San Diego! - are threatened when the station manager chooses to hire a woman reporter.  Instead of the expected story arc - they try to make her life intolerable but she eventually wins them over with her pluck - we get a weird conglomeration (and, oddly, more realistic) of macho chest-thumping and competition over who can bed her.  It is not until she has the audacity to fill in for Ron as anchor when he is unavoidably detained by a littering incident that the animosity breaks out into full-scale gender war.For someone to appreciate the film from a review like this normally requires quoting jokes.  The great thing about the jokes in this film is that the funniest ones are not one-liners appropriate for TV spots.  Instead, they are longer, situation-driven banter that builds.  When the film strays from this pattern into going for the cheap laugh (and, I suspect, ad libs), the film slows into inanity (like some of Farrell's other pictures e.g. Old School).The director's comentary included on this ""unrated"" DVD version seems to confirm the point.  Because it is unrated, commentators Farrell and director McKay think it would be funny to see who can come up with the most offensive words to say to see if they get beeped.  That in itself might be a little funny or at least educational if there was some buildup.  Instead they go on for 10 minutes in a game of 1-upmanship that is not funny because they are, in fact, beeped, and because it goes on and on (and on and on..... you get the idea).  The other special features are more enjoyable, including some out-takes (but not too many of the type where the actors start laughing, thank goodness) and a long list of deleted and/or alternate scenes.  There are some interesting choices in there, and a discussion on why certain performances were used instead of others would have made an interesting DVD commentary.  Too bad we get the swear factory instead.",3,A constrained Will Farrell is a funny Will Farrell,1125792000,"09 4, 2005",2005,3250,"['occured', 'watching', 'film', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'probably', 'great', 'comedian', 'SO', 'much', 'bound', 'be', 'funny', 'then', 'up', 'directors', 'editors', 'trim', 'out', 'what', ""n't"", 'work', 'leave', 'good', 'parts', 'most', 'part', 'succeed', 'Anchorman', 'Legend', 'Ron', 'Burgandy', 'Both', 'Farrell', 'male', 'castmates', 'embody', 'stereotypical', 'parts', 'actors', 'bring', 'enough', 'new', 'life', 'stereotypes', 'immediately', 'recognise', 'characters', 'still', 'being', 'able', 'surprise', 'entertain', 'rather', 'bore', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'unenviable', 'task', 'being', 'straight', 'man', 'off', 'even', 'great', 'comedic', 'moments', 'think', 'key', 'making', 'film', 'work', 'central', 'realism', 'waves', 'absurdity', 'crash', 'much', 'Graham', 'Chapman', 'Monty', 'Python', 'movies.No', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'say', 'Anchorman', 'ground-breaking', 'paradigm-shifting', 'film', 'not', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Airplane', 'Something', 'Mary', 'best', 'minor', 'comedy', 'are', 'more', 'laughs', 'entire', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'catalogue', 'matter', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'SNL', 'skits', 'Jeopardy', 'parodies', 'excepted', 'course', 'story', 'four', 'stooges', 'Channel', '4', 'news', 'team', 'top', ""6-o'clock"", 'news', 'show', 'San', 'Diego', 'are', 'threatened', 'when', 'station', 'manager', 'hire', 'woman', 'reporter', 'Instead', 'expected', 'story', 'arc', 'try', 'make', 'life', 'intolerable', 'eventually', 'over', 'pluck', 'get', 'weird', 'conglomeration', 'oddly', 'more', 'realistic', 'macho', 'chest-thumping', 'competition', 'who', 'can', 'bed', 'not', 'audacity', 'fill', 'Ron', 'anchor', 'when', 'unavoidably', 'detained', 'littering', 'incident', 'animosity', 'out', 'full-scale', 'gender', 'war.For', 'someone', 'appreciate', 'film', 'review', 'normally', 'quoting', 'jokes', 'great', 'thing', 'jokes', 'film', 'funniest', 'ones', 'are', 'not', 'one-liners', 'appropriate', 'TV', 'spots', 'Instead', 'are', 'longer', 'situation-driven', 'banter', 'When', 'film', 'pattern', 'going', 'cheap', 'laugh', 'suspect', 'ad', 'libs', 'film', 'inanity', 'Farrell', 'other', 'pictures', 'e.g', 'Old', 'School', '.The', 'director', 'comentary', 'included', 'unrated', 'DVD', 'version', 'confirm', 'point', 'unrated', 'commentators', 'Farrell', 'director', 'McKay', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'funny', 'see', 'who', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'most', 'offensive', 'words', 'say', 'see', 'get', 'beeped', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'funny', 'least', 'educational', 'was', 'buildup', 'Instead', 'go', '10', 'minutes', 'game', '1-upmanship', 'not', 'funny', 'are', 'fact', 'beeped', '..', 'get', 'idea', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'including', 'out-takes', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'type', 'where', 'actors', 'start', 'laughing', 'thank', 'goodness', 'long', 'list', 'deleted', 'and/or', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'are', 'interesting', 'choices', 'there', 'discussion', 'why', 'certain', 'performances', 'were', 'used', 'instead', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'interesting', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'Too', 'bad', 'get', 'swear', 'factory', 'instead']",Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy
624290,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00005JMYI,Craig Matteson,"[1, 4]","I don't think anyone goes to a Will Ferrell movie expecting high comedy.  ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" is a crude and often silly movie.  However, if you take the time to look just a bit deeper, there are some pretty sly comments on the late 60's and early 70's when women were just entering the workforce and men were losing their minds.  Men could not conceive that women would not only take some jobs, but that there were women who would be better at their job than they were.No, this goofy comedy doesn't present these points in any kind of consistent and convincing way.  But hey, when women began working in newsrooms and everywhere else, what they faced every day was not all that intelligent, consistent, or convincing either.  There is a reason we have laws about hostile environments in the workplace.Will Farrell plays Ron Burgundy, the kind of local news anchor that existed when local news actually mattered.  He is a real celebrity in San Diego.  He has his news team buddies and these idiots rule the roost.  In comes Veronica Corningstone, played wonderfully by Christina Applegate (always undervalued in my book).  She is given the cat show types of stories until something happens and she gets a chance to actually read the local news.  This is a momentous occasion and, of course, she knocks it out of the park.Along the way Veronica and Ron develop a relationship.  She was particularly won over by his playing the Jazz Flute at a local club.  This is one of the better scenes in the movie.  Who remembers when playing the flute was actually something people, even men, did?  The 60s-70s was such a time.  And the wonderfully hideous shades of brown in their clothes bring back lots of awful memories for me.  A few more overwhelming greens would have made that image complete, but the brown sufficed.Anyway, the development of the relationship, its struggles and victories, is hardly the point of the movie.  Nor are its moments approaching intelligence.  The movie is a goofball comedy.  Just expect some rough language, and the kind of bawdy jokes that went on in every workplace during those times, and you will not be too shocked.  Vulgar, yes.  Obscene, no.Have fun.",4,Vulgar?

624291,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00005JMYI,C. Sawin,"[2, 2]","Anchorman is the story of Ron Burgundy and his legacy as an anchorman on the channel 4 news time that frequents the number one spot in the ratings. His news team includes the sports newscaster, Champ Kind, the investigative reporter, Brian Fantana, and the weatherman, Brick Tamland. In this era of newscasting, only men were allowed to read the news. So what'll happen when Veronica Corningstone enters the picture? A woman who has the experience and the dream of becoming a network anchor. Will that dream come true? As Bob Dylan said, ""the times they are a'changin'."" Anything can happen and it's something you're going to have to deal with.Reviewing Anchorman is more difficult than it looks. While it's one of my favorite movies, it's so incredibly random. There is a plot, but it takes a backseat to the memorable and hysterical one-liners from the film that had to be improvised at times. With a movie that's this spontaneous, it's a bit hard to comment on things like the story since it's kind of minimal in a movie like this. The actors who make up the channel four news team portray these characters pretty flawlessly in the film though. They're pretty absorbed in these roles and that's a good thing. It makes this ridiculous movie somewhat believable.Now I've been a Will Ferrell fan for quite awhile now. He's made some pretty hilarious movies in his career, but this one was the last comedy he did that I really enjoyed. Every comedy he's done after this followed the same kind of formula; little plot and a lot of random one-liners and jokes that seemed to come out nowhere. It's funny the first time around and decent the second time, but after that it gets really redundant. People may find that flaw with this film, but I personally enjoyed it. The movie has almost a cult status for its ridiculousness alone. It's not only a film that continued my appreciation for Will Ferrell, but made me a fan of Paul Rudd as well.Anchorman isn't really a movie for everyone. If you're looking for a film that has a good story, a lot of character development, or a steady buildup towards anything worthwhile then this isn't the movie for you. This is the type of movie that is designed just to make you laugh. You're not really supposed to think about what's happening or why it's happening. You're just supposed to have fun with it and enjoy the moment at hand. If you can follow something like Family Guy and laugh at the humor in that, then you shouldn't have a problem with Anchorman. You'll enjoy the comedy for what it is and like it says in the narration at the beginning of the film, you'll probably wind up thinking...one anchorman was more man then the rest. His name was Ron Burgundy. He was like a god walking amongst mere mortals. He had a voice that could make a wolverine purr and suits so fine they made Sinatra look like a hobo.

Anyways, so that said I couldn't believe it took me so long to see `Anchorman' but it was just one of those movies that slipped through the cracks for me, despite the fact that all my friends kept insisting I watch it.  So, after watching `Talladega Nights' I just knew I had to see `Anchorman' ASAP.While I don't feel it's as much a riot as `Talladega Nights', `Anchorman' still holds my attention and induces quite a few belly laughs.  The whole idea of Ron Burgandy (Ferrell) fighting to keep his position as the favored anchorman after the hot young thing Veronica Corningstone (Applegate truly holding her own against this hilarious cast) comes into the station and threatens to steal his thunder.  Aided by his all male posse, including Paul Rudd, David Koechner (gets a bit obnoxious and annoying at times) and the hilarious Steve Carell, Ron does his best to distress Veronica in an attempt to get her fired and or to quit.The whole erection scene (sorry, I had to bring it up) while at first had me thinking ""not again, does every comedy have to do this"" really turned out to be one of the funniest scenes in the film...that whole ""It's an optical illusion"" line was brilliant.  I've only seen the unrated version so I'm not sure what all is different so if I mention a scene that you haven't seen or that you don't see after renting it then I'm sorry...must not be on the theatrical version.  Just look for the Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Tim Robbins cameo scene...it's outrageous, unrealistic and brilliantly hysterical.Great Ferrell comedy that is sure to please any of his true fans, and just might gain him new ones.

Thought to be immature, this comedy can only be enjoyed if you are prepared not to sit down to a very intelligent and sophisticated movie. If you already know that, you're now ready to watch this movie.Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgandy, a anchorman who is insanely vain, and loved by the people.Its more of a boys club in the news room as his three other buddys Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd,Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) and Champ Kind( David Koechner) do everything except blatantly make fun of the rest of their coworkers. All is fun and games until the boss hires Veronica Corningstone (Christine Applegate.) Its open war between the sexes, a war which becomes even more heated when the unfortunate Veronica finds herself the sole object of adorations from the infatuated Ron Burgandy. But love will have its speed bumps, and this perfect couple is no exception.

624300,A2GYX971VETQBV,B00005JMYI,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[1, 2]","Will Ferrell comes alive in _Anchorman_, once again proving that he is one of the few talented acts to come out of the SNL machine in quite some time.  Whenever you're watching a comedy whose talent is a bit low on the sophisticated meter, you have to be enthralled by the characters and the actors who play them.  Ferrell delivers in spades and, while the plot spins around and goes nowhere, he manages to continually delight the audience with his own brand of humor.  Bottom line, if you love Will Ferrell and his style of comedy, you will love _Anchorman_.  If you don't, shop elsewhere.The premise of the film is a hilarious look at the power of reporters during the ""golden age"" of local television.  The character of Ron Burgandy is absolutely hilarious and it is a delight to see a chauvinistic icon struggle with what he views as an invasion by women in the workforce.  My only complaint with the film is the same complaint that I have with many of the comedies that are being released these days.  These comedies seem to be based off quick sketch ideas, many of which are spawned from Saturday Night Live and the like.  The problem with this formula is that many of these sketches are hard to sustain over a couple of minutes, let alone a feature length film.  One gets the impression that these films, including _Anchorman_, would be truly dynamite if they could just restrict themselves to an hour.  The ""90 minute"" comedy rule is just too long for these films to sustain their interest, forcing them to sag at many points.That being said, _Anchorman_ still receives my approval.  Each time I have seen it, I have been laughing out loud and forced to tears at a few spots.  Will Ferrell's performance is stunning and I think he is truly one of the most gifted comedic actors working these days.",4,"If You Love Will Ferrell, You'll Love _Anchorman_",1099526400,"11 4, 2004",2004,1805,"['Will', 'Ferrell', 'alive', '_Anchorman_', 'once', 'again', 'proving', 'one', 'few', 'talented', 'acts', 'come', 'SNL', 'machine', 'quite', 'time', 'Whenever', ""'re"", 'watching', 'comedy', 'talent', 'bit', 'low', 'sophisticated', 'meter', 'have', 'be', 'enthralled', 'characters', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Ferrell', 'delivers', 'spades', 'plot', 'nowhere', 'continually', 'delight', 'audience', 'own', 'brand', 'humor', 'Bottom', 'line', 'love', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'style', 'comedy', 'will', 'love', '_Anchorman_', 'do', ""n't"", 'shop', 'elsewhere.The', 'premise', 'film', 'hilarious', 'look', 'power', 'reporters', 'golden', 'age', 'local', 'television', 'character', 'Ron', 'Burgandy', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'delight', 'see', 'chauvinistic', 'icon', 'struggle', 'what', 'invasion', 'women', 'workforce', 'only', 'complaint', 'film', 'same', 'complaint', 'have', 'many', 'comedies', 'are', 'being', 'released', 'days', 'comedies', 'seem', 'be', 'based', 'off', 'quick', 'sketch', 'ideas', 'many', 'are', 'spawned', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'like', 'problem', 'formula', 'many', 'sketches', 'are', 'hard', 'sustain', 'couple', 'minutes', 'let', 'alone', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'One', 'impression', 'films', 'including', '_Anchorman_', 'would', 'be', 'truly', 'dynamite', 'could', 'just', 'restrict', 'hour', '90', 'minute', 'comedy', 'rule', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'films', 'sustain', 'interest', 'forcing', 'sag', 'many', 'points.That', 'being', 'said', '_Anchorman_', 'still', 'approval', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'have', 'been', 'laughing', 'loud', 'forced', 'tears', 'few', 'spots', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'performance', 'stunning', 'think', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'gifted', 'comedic', 'actors', 'working', 'days']",Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy

The local news has no competition from cable of any sort, so Burgandy and his crew are celebrities in the San Diego area.  His viewers recite his trademark line that he closes every broadcast with:  ""San Diegeo, you stay classy.""  Burgandy has a dream of one day becoming a national news anchor.  Then, Veronica Corningstone, played by Christina Applegate, comes to work at the station, and Burgandy's world is thrown off its axis....This movie definitely has its moments.  Ferrell shines at various points in the movie as a newsman that is full of himself, but is large in his community, that is just doesn't matter.  The movie does an adequate job spoofing local television news (right down to the almost unnatural attention a pregnant panda gets).  The gangster like rivalry between the local news stations (which have crews filled with Ferrell's buddies, such as Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, and Luke Wilson) is amusing and culminates in a rumble.  Fred Willard also turns in his usual excellent comedic performance as head of the newsroom.However, the comedy is not evenly paced and frequently over the top simply to be over the top in the hopes of getting a laugh.  Ferrell's big hit 'Old School' did a much better job of maintaining an even level of humor without having to get so ridiculous as to lose the plot.  The movie could have been better with a few more news scenes that allowed Ferrell's behind the desk personality to take center stage.Overall, Ferrell fans will probably like the movie, but will probably be a little let down after movies like 'Old School.'

Set in 1970s San Diego--trapped in Will Ferrell's ""deer in the headlights"" facial expression--ANCHORMAN gleefully basks in its irreverent male chauvinism, and makes no apologies along the way.But I've already given more meaning to this flick than its intentions.  ANCHORMAN is pure, 110-proof nonsense--some of it priceless, most of it annoying cornball.

Blonde, glorious Christina Applegate stars opposite Ferrell, and she comes across as bored and wooden in her role (although I felt wooden while watching her).  Yet the shining moments of this movie were captured by Ferrell's beloved ""news posse"":  a sports reporter (David Koechner); a roving news reporter (Paul Rudd); and a weatherman (Steve Carrell, who easily steals every scene he's in).  When these guys broke into a rendition of Seventies hit ""Afternoon Delight"" I thought my pair of Depends could hold back no more moisture as I laughed sans consequence.Another plus:  ANCHORMAN boasts visits from several comedic actors in a plethora of cameos--Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, and Vince Vaughn, to name a few.

As someone who never watched ""Saturday Night Live,"" I was not entirely certain what to expect. So, I began trudging backwards. I watched ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" and was struck by its light-hearted silliness. It has a sort of playful charm that most people can easily appreciate. But then I bought ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" and was shocked by the clumsy writing, delivery, and structure.The writing and delivery is excruciatingly awkward (and not in an ""ironic"" way). It is every ""bad"" joke you have ever heard ... and that would have been fine, if only the writers/director gave them a fresh spin. Unfortunately, that did not happen. And while there are some ""bad"" films which have tremendous moments of greatness ... this is not one of those. The ""jazz flute"" bit is amusing, but not enough negate the film's very deep flaws. While I expected a ""surface"" film (one devoid of meaning but rich in fun), I did not expect this lack of technical sophistication. One such issue resides with the multiple narrators. While a third-person narrator initially lends the work a ""mockumentary"" feel, the audience then receives a series of first-person narrations ... how exactly does that work? (And, no ""suspension of disbelief"" is not the problem here ... it is a serious logical error).I maintain that this work is representative of Farrell's unpolished side (perhaps his ""Saturday Night Live"" side). Still, this provides a basis for examining Farrell's newer works. It is amazing to see the progress this actor has made stylistically and technically over the past four years. It is wonderful to note Farrell can now create both mature art (like ""Stranger than Fiction"") AND spirited comedies that reach a wide audience (like ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"").

While spending their lives covering stories of astonishing banality, they believe they are the best at their various jobs: even Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) who can barely string two words together without the aid of an autocue.  Their lives are thrown into chaos with the arrival of Vanessa Corningstone (Christina Applegate), who proves herself much superior in terms of television technique, while remaining strangely impervious to the team's sexist (and cringingly obvious) attempts to get her into bed.  The scenario here is a familiar one, reminiscent of SWITCHING CHANNELS (1988), or more famously HIS GIRL FRIDAY (1941) in which the newsroom becomes the arena for an analysis of sexual politics.  Both director Adam McKay and Ferrell (who co-wrote the script) are concerned to show limited the opportunities for women are in professions historically deemed &#34;male&#34; (such as the media).

Usually I have to be in a certain mood to see one of his movies. I kept hearing how Anchorman was such a great film and wondered what the hype was about. Well, the hype is well deserved.What we get is the fictional story of Ron Burgundy. Swinging newscaster of the 1970's. He dominates the airwaves and has a way with the ladies. However, all this is about to change as the news station is hiring its first female anchor.There are many great quotable lines in this movie. The humor may seem pure slapstick on the surface, but there are some clever lines going on in this movie. I have to point out that the news anchor gang fight is worth the price of admission.The supporting cast did an excellent job. Special recognition should go to Steve Carrell for playing Brick (a not so bright character who only seems to know what is going on with the weather), David Koechner for playing Champ (sports anchor with his own special catchphrase), Paul Rudd as Brian (like Ron, also a ladies man and seems to act as Ron's right hand man). Christina Applegate also deserves a big nod for playing the no nonsense reporter Veronica who is fighting for her right to anchor the news.There are some surprising cameos as well such as Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins and Luke Wilson. They all help to round out the cast as competing news anchors, with the exception of Jack Black as a biker.There are also some nice special features on the dvd including Will Ferrell in full Ron Burgundy mode doing a mock interview for ESPN in 1979. There is also an interview with Bill Kurtis and Ron Burgundy done in the style of The Actor's Studio. All about Ron's life and career. Also included are may deleted scenes and out takes from the film.So, enjoy this movie because...

Will Farrell, Christina Applegate and all of the others do well in this film, but there just isn't that much to work with.The high point of the film is when Ron plays his Jazz flute in the club, that part was hilarious and my favorite part of the film. Like I said, there are a few other highlights, Ron throws a burrito out the window and hits biker Jack Black, and like when one of Ron's co-workers wears his sex panther cologne that smells like ""a turd covered in burnt hair"" among other things. These parts are hilarious!The soundtrack to the film is amazing; some of the best 70's music in one collection. Farrell and three other co-workers show off their singing ability by singing a version of ""Afternoon Delight"".Overall a good film, mainly for fans of Will Ferrell.

He is superbly funny in the movie despite the many shortcoming the movie has. For exampleFerrell's cast members like Steve Carrell are not funny at all,in fact he has some stupid lines in the movie.For instance after everyone gets drunk at Ron's party , his character Brick Tamland mentions the awful thing he did: ""I ate a red candle"". Later on in an office meeting when its announcedtbat a woman will enter the hormone male infested world ofKWN Brick yells but admits he doesnt know why. This is notfunny, I think Steve was tacked in at the last moment as a favor for somebody.As someboy else mentioned if you never seen any of Ferrel'sstuff youll not only think its not funny but offensive as well.Ron Burgundy while prouding himself as a ""stud"" is completelyoffensive to women, theyre just sex objects to him.Even when an Angel appears in Veronica Corningstone, he cant help but make a fool of himself in picking her  up:""You have a breaktaking heinie"", he says. LMAOLater on when the two are working together, he cant evengive keep his physical attraction from her:""Mr. Burgandy you have a massive erection"" says Veronica Corningstone.What the hell is this? Porn talk. LOLBut since the movie takes place in the 70's with these loosemorals, one expect this in ""Anchorman"". I recommened it only for Ferrel fans.The dvd as well despite having a boatload of extras is somewhatdisappointing in the commentary track, with Ferrell only kidding around and telling jokes but giving no details about h9w the movie was made.

Had there been a more human element to Burgandy it might have made for a slightly better movie.The thin story, so weak it cannot stand on its own two legs, has a woman arrive at a male-dominated newsroom in 1970s San Diego determined to prove she can be just as good. The men react with horror. They clash. The material is so thin it is 2-dimensional. If you need any more proof check out the utterly terrible 'lost' Anchorman movie Wake Up, Ron Burgandy, a so-called movie assembled from deleted scenes and plots. Much of Anchorman should have been deleted too, but then the running time would barely exceed 70 minutes. Adam McKay and Will Ferrell simply did not have enough mileage for a feature length movie with this anorexic premise.For all his screaming and attention-seeking it's somewhat ironic that Will Ferrell's never became a superstar, while supporting actor Steve Carrell went on to much bigger and better things. He's clearly the best actor of the bunch and the movie would be substantially even less funny without him.It is sporadically funny. It is not as funny as the mass hysteria would lead you to believe.

Unfortunately I would rate it a complete failure as a script and plot. I cannot really think of one scene or line that was great. Compare this to ""Bridesmaids"" or ""Talladega Nights"".

Unfortunately they had nothing to work with regard to the script and plot.3) Environment - The clothing was interesting in showing the 70's but overall it was not impressive.

624383,A2GVJ83F092MIS,B00005JMYI,J. Hayes,"[8, 10]","Anchorman is the story of Ron Burgandy, top anchorman in San Diego in the 1970's. Burgandy, played by Ferrell, heads the top news team in San Diego. The 4 men that make up the team are sexist and egotistical, thinking that women bow to them. This is evident when Ron uses pick-up lines such as ""Do you know who I am? You should. I'm famous, people know me."" The Channel 4 news team has it good as the #1 rated news team until their boss decides to add some diversity to the team by bringing in a woman, Veronica Corningstone (played by Christina Applegate). The crew is outraged that a woman is being allowed to do a man's job, and what ensues is a battle between Ron and Veronica over who is a better anchor. Eventually Veronica gets Ron fired accidentally, and Ron goes into a 3 month depression (where he is always drinking milk) until only he can be called on to report the biggest story of the year. To add to all of this, the team has to compete with other news stations around San Diego. To me the funniest part in this movie was the fight scene among all of the local stations, including the public access channel. Here we get cameos from Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller (anchor for the Spanish news station!) and in other parts Jack Black appears. There are many great moments in this movie, with some good catch phrases to boot. I just didn't think this came together as a complete movie. Another reviewer said it was like a long SNL skit and I could not agree more. Overall I don't think this is a great movie but you should see it anyway.

Or a boring one.  For all I know, both type of movies have already been made.  Either/or, ANCHORMAN is neither.  Rather it exists to use the topic as a (necessarily) paper-thin vehicle for Will Ferrell and co. to string together a hit-and-miss procession of humor that one would expect from the SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE school of comedy.  If you're not in sync with Ferrell-era SNL humor, viewing this DVD probably won't be time well spent.  On the other hand, most fans should find enough here to be worth watching, albeit you'll probably wish the movie had a little more going for it than it does.  By the way, if you want the theatrical version of this movie get the standard DVD release, not this unrated one.For the most part Ferrell provides the laughs one expects of him, counting on the viewer to find him to be an ultimately likable jerk as the gender gap issue gets yet another go-round.  Yet I'd say it's the inspired performance of Christina Applegate that keeps this movie more watchable than it would otherwise be, compensating for several wacky plot developments, periodic slippage in the amount of funny moments, and that most of the other main characters are unlikable jerks.  The irreverent commentary on this unrated version is worth a listen for fans (let's just say that they spend virtually no time commenting on the movie), and the bonus features include outtakes, etc.  Overall, ANCHORMAN is not a sophisticated comedy, but it has enough funny bits to counterbalance the juvenile aspects that will probably leave most feeling they got quite a few laughs, but yet something was missing.",3,SNL Goes To The Movies Yet Again ...,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,1725,"['potential', 'intriguing', 'movie', 'be', 'made', 'breaking', 'gender', 'barrier', 'TV', 'land', 'news', 'anchors', 'boring', 'one', 'know', 'type', 'movies', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'made', 'Either/or', 'ANCHORMAN', 'use', 'topic', 'necessarily', 'paper-thin', 'vehicle', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'co.', 'string', 'together', 'hit-and-miss', 'procession', 'humor', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'SATURDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIVE', 'school', 'comedy', ""'re"", 'not', 'sync', 'Ferrell-era', 'SNL', 'humor', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'time', 'well', 'spent', 'other', 'hand', 'most', 'fans', 'should', 'find', 'enough', 'here', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'wish', 'movie', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'going', 'way', 'want', 'theatrical', 'version', 'movie', 'get', 'standard', 'DVD', 'release', 'not', 'unrated', 'most', 'part', 'Ferrell', 'laughs', 'one', 'counting', 'viewer', 'find', 'be', 'ultimately', 'likable', 'jerk', 'gender', 'gap', 'issue', 'yet', 'go-round', ""'d"", 'say', 'inspired', 'performance', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'movie', 'more', 'watchable', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'compensating', 'several', 'wacky', 'plot', 'developments', 'periodic', 'slippage', 'amount', 'funny', 'moments', 'most', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'unlikable', 'jerks', 'irreverent', 'commentary', 'unrated', 'version', 'listen', 'fans', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'spend', 'virtually', 'time', 'commenting', 'movie', 'bonus', 'include', 'outtakes', 'etc', 'Overall', 'ANCHORMAN', 'not', 'sophisticated', 'comedy', 'enough', 'funny', 'bits', 'counterbalance', 'juvenile', 'will', 'probably', 'leave', 'most', 'feeling', 'got', 'quite', 'few', 'laughs', 'yet', 'something', 'was', 'missing']",Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy

624409,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B00005JMYI,Kaya Savas,"[0, 3]","MOVIE: This movie is just one big SNL skit made feature lengthed. The movie I compared this most to was Dodgeball. I was looking for similarities and differences between the two and unfortunetly found more similarities. Even though Will Ferrel co-wrote the movie it didn't really click. What I liked was that many of the jokes had a reference to something and even if they were random they still had some part in what was going on at the time during the scene. Dodgeball lacked hilarity because none of the jokes had a reference they were just blurbs of utter stupidity. This movie is not only making fun of the 70's era it makes fun of the news, jazz lounges, street gangs, men, and the rest of the jokes fall under the random category. What really hurts the movie is that the jokes are forced. Everyone in the audience will probably laugh in sync because all the jokes in this movie are physical comedy. Everything that you laugh at will be visually provoked. If you think about it, nothing that the characters say is funny. Imagine the &quot;glass case of emotion&quot; scene without Ferrel flopping around and crying hysterically. See! The laughs are forced but so goes with SNL, so it is a very enjoyable movie, but the second time around you wont laugh.ACTING: Will Ferrel is Will Ferrel. His acting is the same as it was on SNL and even more similar to Zoolander. He is big, loud, and funny. Nothing new, just the same ol' Will that we love. Steve Carell (The Daily Show, Bruce Almighty) is the funniest guy in the movie. He plays the dumbfounded weatherman who makes the funniest cracks throughout the movie. I feel that he was the only real thing that worked perfectly in the movie, you didn't get tired of him but you didn't miss him either. The cameos in this movie were actually &quot;cameos&quot;. Dodgeball had the stupidest cameos ever, and they were so pointless. Will Ferrel invites some of his buddies including past co-stars Vince Vaugn, Luke Wilson, and Ben Stiller to join the fun as well as some familiar faces from SNL. The cast is fun no doubt about it.BOTTOM LINE: You will laugh at the movie, but the laughs are very forced and seeing it the second time around will be dull. Today's comedies are starting to become so repetitive and it makes me wonder if comediens like Peter Sellers, Mel Brooks, John Candy, Bill Murray, and other greats will ever have an influence on future comediens.",3,A Better Fare Than Dodgeball But Still Not Really Funny,1090368000,"07 21, 2004",2004,2413,"['MOVIE', 'movie', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'SNL', 'skit', 'made', 'feature', 'lengthed', 'movie', 'compared', 'most', 'was', 'Dodgeball', 'was', 'looking', 'similarities', 'differences', 'two', 'unfortunetly', 'found', 'more', 'similarities', 'Even', 'Will', 'Ferrel', 'co-wrote', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'click', 'What', 'liked', 'was', 'many', 'jokes', 'had', 'reference', 'something', 'even', 'were', 'random', 'still', 'had', 'part', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'time', 'scene', 'Dodgeball', 'lacked', 'hilarity', 'none', 'jokes', 'had', 'reference', 'were', 'just', 'blurbs', 'utter', 'stupidity', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'making', 'fun', '70', 'era', 'fun', 'news', 'jazz', 'lounges', 'street', 'gangs', 'men', 'rest', 'jokes', 'fall', 'random', 'category', 'What', 'really', 'movie', 'jokes', 'are', 'forced', 'Everyone', 'audience', 'will', 'probably', 'laugh', 'sync', 'jokes', 'movie', 'are', 'physical', 'comedy', 'Everything', 'laugh', 'will', 'be', 'visually', 'provoked', 'think', 'nothing', 'characters', 'say', 'funny', 'Imagine', 'quot', 'glass', 'case', 'emotion', 'quot', 'scene', 'Ferrel', 'flopping', 'around', 'crying', 'hysterically', 'See', 'laughs', 'are', 'forced', 'so', 'SNL', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'wont', 'laugh.ACTING', 'Will', 'Ferrel', 'Will', 'Ferrel', 'acting', 'same', 'was', 'SNL', 'even', 'more', 'similar', 'Zoolander', 'big', 'loud', 'funny', 'Nothing', 'new', 'just', 'same', 'ol', 'Will', 'love', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Daily', 'Show', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'funniest', 'guy', 'movie', 'dumbfounded', 'weatherman', 'who', 'funniest', 'cracks', 'movie', 'feel', 'was', 'only', 'real', 'thing', 'worked', 'perfectly', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'tired', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'either', 'cameos', 'movie', 'were', 'actually', 'quot', 'cameos', 'quot', 'Dodgeball', 'had', 'stupidest', 'cameos', 'ever', 'were', 'so', 'pointless', 'Will', 'Ferrel', 'buddies', 'including', 'co-stars', 'Vince', 'Vaugn', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'join', 'fun', 'as', 'well', 'familiar', 'SNL', 'cast', 'fun', 'doubt', 'it.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'will', 'laugh', 'movie', 'laughs', 'are', 'very', 'forced', 'seeing', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'will', 'be', 'dull', 'Today', 'comedies', 'are', 'starting', 'become', 'so', 'repetitive', 'wonder', 'comediens', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'John', 'Candy', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'other', 'greats', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'influence', 'future', 'comediens']",Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy

At once it was a laugh out loud, slap your mama funny movie and then it becomes this dull, worn out, drawn out and unfunny Saturday Night Live skit from the mid-90's.  In other words, when it is funny, it's very funny, but when it misses the mark, it misses by a good ol' country mile.Will Ferrell goofs his way through this flick in sometimes funny, but mostly annoying, fashion.  Christina Applegate wasted herself here.  The ""newsteam"" that backed up Ferrell was boring.  I have to admit, though, that they captured the oafishness and all out idiotic mentality of most reporters.  I've worked with a few in my day when I was at a local station, and the majority of them aren't half as great as they think they are.  Their egos are bloated well beyond capacity.The funniest parts of this film are when other stars make cameo appearances.  Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn, and Luke Wilson all have wonderful bit parts that result in hilarity.  The gem of the bunch has got to be Jack Black.  His burrito-induced road rage resulting in a punted pooch is classic.I don't recommend purchasing this flick.

624417,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JMYI,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[1, 7]","The power of parody can be strong when the story has been revealed and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy has a powerful effect on the audience as it's story of male chauvinism, sexual harassment, and male insecurity has been depicted.  The parody is frequently over the top, which is the purpose of the parody, and it enhances small things men do in order to be portrayed as strong males.  In Anchorman, the parody brings out Ron Burgundy's insecurities in regards to women and other men, which often are either clever or belly-achingly hilarious.The story highlights Ron Burgundy's (Will Ferrell) escapades as a news anchorman for a local TV station in San Diego at the beginning of the 1970s.  The time is before cable TV and channel surfing.  Before the film begins the audience is displayed a short statement informing the viewers that the film is based on a true story where the only thing that have been changed are the names, the location, and the events.  This throws in an interesting perspective as the film unfolds as there are several stories where male chauvinism and sexual harassment have taken place at the work place.Anchorman begins with a party after Ron and his cohorts have found out that their station KVWN is ranked number one in the city of San Diego.  During the party Ron and his three buddies Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), Champ Kind (David Koechner), and Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) entertain themselves with booze, women, and superficial conversations as Ron discovers a beautiful blond.  The blond woman is Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) whom Ron insults with sexual suggestions and later finds out that his new station has diversified by hiring Veronica as a part of the news group.  This raises an uprising among Ron and his men as they proclaim that women cannot do the work they are performing.  Instead the men begin to make crude sexual jokes in regards to Veronica and the sexual harassment has begun.Veronica is aware that the line of work that she has chosen is male dominated, yet she strives to accomplish her dream to become a news anchor.  The assignments that she receives are silly as they include cat fashion shows and alike.  The men at the news station persist in keeping her away from the real work, as she is a woman and in their perspective women cannot perform the same kind of work as men.  However, after an accident with a biker (Jack Black), Ron is held back due to emotional distress, and Veronica sees her moment of opportunity, which she seizes.  This is the beginning of the end for Ron as he is about to put the final nail in the coffin by saying a four letter word beginning with f in regards to the people of San Diego at the end of a show.There is a scene in the film where Ron and his friends end up in a street brawl with all kinds of gruesome weapons.  This scene is a culminating analogy with strong satirical suggestions in regards to male insecurities, which are often attempted to be hidden behind a large dose of aggressive behavior.  In the scene there are four other news stations that are represented by Wes Mantooth (Vince Vaughn), Frank Vitchard (Luke Wilson), a Public TV News Anchor (Tim Robbins), and a Hispanic TV News Anchor (Ben Stiller), and instead of trying to find a solution these men let testosterone flow as an arm is chopped off and a man on a horse is impaled by a trident.Anchorman has several interesting moments where the parody offers much laughter, yet there are moments when the humor does not work.  Despite the moments of lacking laughter Anchorman will provide a good cinematic experience as the film offers both humor, insight, and valuable lessons.  The parody,  as mentioned, comes together in the end as a powerful tool to depict an important lesson in regards to male chauvinism, sexual harassment, and male insecurity.  The humor might be necessary for some hardcore alpha-males as they might recognize themselves in the story, and it might otherwise be offensive for all viewers.  Nevertheless, Adam McKay and his cast put together a well-made comedy with a valuable message.",3,Funny Parody of Male Chauvinism and Male Insecurities...,1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,4098,"['power', 'parody', 'can', 'be', 'strong', 'when', 'story', 'been', 'revealed', 'Anchorman', 'Legend', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'powerful', 'effect', 'audience', 'story', 'male', 'chauvinism', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'male', 'insecurity', 'been', 'depicted', 'parody', 'frequently', 'top', 'purpose', 'parody', 'small', 'things', 'men', 'do', 'order', 'be', 'portrayed', 'strong', 'males', 'Anchorman', 'parody', 'out', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'insecurities', 'regards', 'women', 'other', 'men', 'often', 'are', 'clever', 'belly-achingly', 'hilarious.The', 'story', 'highlights', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'news', 'anchorman', 'local', 'TV', 'station', 'San', 'Diego', 'beginning', '1970s', 'time', 'cable', 'TV', 'channel', 'surfing', 'film', 'audience', 'displayed', 'short', 'statement', 'informing', 'viewers', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'where', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'are', 'names', 'location', 'events', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'film', 'are', 'several', 'stories', 'where', 'male', 'chauvinism', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'work', 'place.Anchorman', 'party', 'Ron', 'cohorts', 'have', 'found', 'out', 'station', 'KVWN', 'ranked', 'number', 'one', 'city', 'San', 'Diego', 'party', 'Ron', 'three', 'buddies', 'Brian', 'Fantana', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Champ', 'Kind', 'David', 'Koechner', 'Brick', 'Tamland', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'entertain', 'booze', 'women', 'superficial', 'conversations', 'Ron', 'beautiful', 'blond', 'blond', 'woman', 'Veronica', 'Corningstone', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'whom', 'Ron', 'insults', 'sexual', 'suggestions', 'later', 'out', 'new', 'station', 'diversified', 'hiring', 'Veronica', 'part', 'news', 'group', 'uprising', 'Ron', 'men', 'proclaim', 'women', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'work', 'are', 'performing', 'Instead', 'men', 'begin', 'make', 'crude', 'sexual', 'jokes', 'regards', 'Veronica', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'begun.Veronica', 'aware', 'line', 'work', 'chosen', 'male', 'dominated', 'yet', 'accomplish', 'dream', 'become', 'news', 'anchor', 'assignments', 'are', 'silly', 'include', 'cat', 'fashion', 'shows', 'alike', 'men', 'news', 'station', 'persist', 'keeping', 'away', 'real', 'work', 'woman', 'perspective', 'women', 'can', 'not', 'perform', 'same', 'kind', 'work', 'men', 'However', 'accident', 'biker', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Ron', 'held', 'back', 'due', 'emotional', 'distress', 'Veronica', 'moment', 'opportunity', 'beginning', 'end', 'Ron', 'put', 'final', 'nail', 'coffin', 'saying', 'four', 'letter', 'word', 'beginning', 'f', 'regards', 'people', 'San', 'Diego', 'end', 'show.There', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'Ron', 'friends', 'end', 'up', 'street', 'brawl', 'kinds', 'gruesome', 'weapons', 'scene', 'culminating', 'analogy', 'strong', 'satirical', 'suggestions', 'regards', 'male', 'insecurities', 'are', 'often', 'attempted', 'be', 'hidden', 'large', 'dose', 'aggressive', 'behavior', 'scene', 'are', 'four', 'other', 'news', 'stations', 'are', 'represented', 'Wes', 'Mantooth', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Frank', 'Vitchard', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Public', 'TV', 'News', 'Anchor', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Hispanic', 'TV', 'News', 'Anchor', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'instead', 'trying', 'find', 'solution', 'men', 'let', 'testosterone', 'flow', 'arm', 'chopped', 'off', 'man', 'horse', 'impaled', 'trident.Anchorman', 'several', 'interesting', 'moments', 'where', 'parody', 'much', 'laughter', 'yet', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'humor', 'not', 'work', 'moments', 'lacking', 'laughter', 'Anchorman', 'will', 'provide', 'good', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'film', 'humor', 'insight', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'parody', 'mentioned', 'together', 'end', 'powerful', 'tool', 'depict', 'important', 'lesson', 'regards', 'male', 'chauvinism', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'male', 'insecurity', 'humor', 'might', 'be', 'necessary', 'hardcore', 'alpha-males', 'might', 'recognize', 'story', 'might', 'otherwise', 'be', 'offensive', 'viewers', 'Nevertheless', 'Adam', 'McKay', 'cast', 'put', 'together', 'well-made', 'comedy', 'valuable', 'message']",Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy

I say this knowing that for the most part I could not stand the Ted Baxter character and while I was not exactly wincing at the one-liners in this 2004 comedy, I was not laughing a lot either.  The script by director Adam McKay and star Will Ferrell sets up some comic opportunities but tends not to take advantage of them.  For example, it is established early on that Burgundy will say anything that is written on a teleprompter.  While this comes up as a major plot development, it strikes me as a waste of a really good running gag because they could have come up with so much more.Ron Burgundy represents the news anchor in his prime, circa San Diego in the 1970s.  Arrogant and narcissistic, not to mention incapable of saying anything that does not sound pompous and egotistical, Burgundy is enabled by his producer Ed Harken (Fred Willard), and the rest of the evening news team: hip roving reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), sports reporter Champ Kind (David Koechner), and clueless weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell, Bruce Almighty).  Into their male dominated world comes Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), who wants to read the news her self, apparently unconcerned that it is a man's job.  Thus, the battle lines are drawn between Veronica and all of the guys as the station.Now, a battle of the sexes sounds pretty good, but that idea is undercut by the fact that a romance springs up between Burgundy and Corningstone.  The fact that they have the hots for each other does not take away from their ambition, and the funniest scenes for me in the film are when the two of them are muttering insults each other at the end of the newscast while the credits role.  But there should have been a lot more comedy to be milked from their on camera battles, and ""Anchorman"" is to busy running on to the next bit to stop and figure out how everything fits together.  This is a film that has people singing ""Afternoon Delight"" at one moment and then has news teams getting ready to rumble in a back alley.  But it never comes together with any sort of unified comedy theory that makes it all work.  Instead we are left with bits and pieces with as many misses as hits.The bottom line for me is that ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" should have been a satire, and it ends up being nothing more than an over-extended comedy sketch.  The movie is set in the 1970s and you would think that should come into play more in terms of the comedy, but it really does not.  The flaw, I suspect, is that McKay and Ferrell know that their SNL audience has little in the way of a rudimentary knowledge of that particular decade (to wit, leisure suits and facial hair), so the story is set back then simply so the idea of a female news anchor can be see as a radical idea.  But even that become another font of comic opportunity that ""Anchorman"" neglects to use to great effect.  The result is okay, and Ferrell certainly tries hard, but for me the entire movie has as many laughs as one of his really good SNL skits, and when you are talking a feature length movie, that is not a good thing.",3,Too many missed opportunities keep this from being funny,1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,3280,"['watching', 'Anchorman', 'Legend', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'clear', 'funniest', 'television', 'anchorman', 'all-time', 'remains', 'Ted', 'Baxter', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'say', 'knowing', 'most', 'part', 'could', 'not', 'stand', 'Ted', 'Baxter', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'wincing', 'one-liners', '2004', 'comedy', 'was', 'not', 'laughing', 'lot', 'either', 'script', 'director', 'Adam', 'McKay', 'star', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'up', 'comic', 'opportunities', 'not', 'take', 'advantage', 'example', 'established', 'early', 'Burgundy', 'will', 'say', 'anything', 'written', 'teleprompter', 'up', 'major', 'plot', 'development', 'waste', 'really', 'good', 'running', 'gag', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'more.Ron', 'Burgundy', 'news', 'anchor', 'prime', 'circa', 'San', 'Diego', '1970s', 'Arrogant', 'narcissistic', 'not', 'mention', 'incapable', 'saying', 'anything', 'not', 'sound', 'pompous', 'egotistical', 'Burgundy', 'enabled', 'producer', 'Ed', 'Harken', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'rest', 'evening', 'news', 'team', 'hip', 'roving', 'reporter', 'Brian', 'Fantana', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'sports', 'reporter', 'Champ', 'Kind', 'David', 'Koechner', 'clueless', 'weatherman', 'Brick', 'Tamland', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'Into', 'male', 'dominated', 'world', 'Veronica', 'Corningstone', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'who', 'read', 'news', 'self', 'apparently', 'unconcerned', 'man', 'job', 'Thus', 'battle', 'lines', 'are', 'drawn', 'Veronica', 'guys', 'station.Now', 'battle', 'sexes', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'undercut', 'fact', 'romance', 'up', 'Burgundy', 'Corningstone', 'fact', 'have', 'hots', 'other', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'ambition', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'when', 'two', 'are', 'muttering', 'insults', 'other', 'end', 'newscast', 'credits', 'role', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'comedy', 'be', 'milked', 'camera', 'battles', 'Anchorman', 'busy', 'running', 'next', 'bit', 'stop', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'everything', 'together', 'film', 'people', 'singing', 'Afternoon', 'Delight', 'one', 'moment', 'then', 'news', 'teams', 'getting', 'ready', 'rumble', 'back', 'alley', 'never', 'together', 'sort', 'unified', 'comedy', 'theory', 'work', 'Instead', 'are', 'left', 'bits', 'pieces', 'many', 'misses', 'hits.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'Anchorman', 'Legend', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'satire', 'up', 'being', 'nothing', 'more', 'over-extended', 'comedy', 'sketch', 'movie', 'set', '1970s', 'would', 'think', 'should', 'come', 'play', 'more', 'terms', 'comedy', 'really', 'not', 'flaw', 'suspect', 'McKay', 'Ferrell', 'know', 'SNL', 'audience', 'little', 'way', 'rudimentary', 'knowledge', 'particular', 'decade', 'wit', 'leisure', 'suits', 'facial', 'hair', 'story', 'set', 'back', 'then', 'simply', 'idea', 'female', 'news', 'anchor', 'can', 'be', 'see', 'radical', 'idea', 'even', 'font', 'comic', 'opportunity', 'Anchorman', 'neglects', 'use', 'great', 'effect', 'result', 'okay', 'Ferrell', 'certainly', 'hard', 'entire', 'movie', 'as', 'many', 'laughs', 'one', 'really', 'good', 'SNL', 'skits', 'when', 'are', 'talking', 'feature', 'length', 'movie', 'not', 'good', 'thing']",Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy

Sherwin,"[21, 28]","Will Ferrell shines in this movie about the old boy's club at a 1970's TV news show being threatened like anything when--of all things--a WOMAN is hired to join the crew. Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy; Cristina Applegate plays Veronica Corningstone, the newcomer on the block with a strong willed desire to be an anchor herself. Farrell, especially being the male chauvinist as he is, sees Corningstone's arrival as yet another chance to have himself a conquest. Corningstone, predictably in this type of plot, wants no part in an office romance. Worse yet for Ron Burgundy and his male buddies on the news show: newcomer Veronica Corningstone actually knows something about journalism!There are numerous funny moments in this movie here on DVD. There's of course the gang warfare between five (count 'em, five) separate news channels that's really well done. Another scene worth mention is the scene with Ron's dog that despite being a bit troubling is actually hysterical. There's Steve Carrell as the weatherman with a questionable IQ level who refers to the state of Iowa as ""the Middle East.""  Moreover, there are some great cameos by such pros as Tim Robbins, Danny Trejo and Ben Stiller.While watching this movie you get the sense that the actors really wanted to do it to showcase their talents and just plain have fun making a fun movie. My advice is not to go into this comedy expecting it to be literally flawless. Instead, this comedy flick is perfect for the person who wants to enjoy some laughs and funny situations while relaxing their brain and not worrying about following a complicated plot. Yes, I know, there's the subplot theme of the 70's feminist movement, but without any doubt this takes a back seat to the comedy.The DVD comes with great extras that increase its value. Extras include the ""Making of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,"" bloopers and deleted scenes, and (of course) the ""Ron Burgundy A&E; Biography."" Sound and picture quality are very good.I would encourage you to get this DVD: the movie itself is very good for a fun time! Fans of Farrell and the Saturday Night Live style of comedy are going to be especially pleased with the way they made this DVD! The extras make it all the more worthwhile.",4,The critics are being too critical!

624449,A1W6FFD9OYH5RZ,B00005JMYI,"Matt Russell ""superk23""","[3, 3]","Will Ferrell is back in another silly movie.  This time it works.  Although, Ferrell is not the one getting all of the laughs.  No no, this anchorman better believe there is no I in team because he is lost without them.The story begins with a little telling of the legend of an anchorman named Ron Burgundy (Ferrell).  His news team includes Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), Champ Kind (David Koechner), and Brick Tamland (Steven Carell).  This foursome brings the San Diego news to people every night.  Oh, and Burgundy is a five time Emmy winner for his desk job.All is working great.  The teamwork, cohesiveness, fun, and high-spirits are in full gear.  Then, a threat arrives.  Oh no, it's a woman named Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate).  Corningstone is quick to find herself in the same situation that she has faced in past experiences.  Nobody feels that a woman is capable for anything except something for eyes to feast on.It turns out, that Burgundy and Corningstone share more than a professional relationship with each other.  This leads Bugundy turning his team into a quartet to sing about love.  One of the cooler parts of the film.  However, this relationship is ruined when Corningstone takes over the desk job and Burgundy loses his job.  To not ruin the movie, I will not discuss the details that lead up to this moment.However, in the end, the whole team must figure out a way to catch the biggest story of the summer, which involves a panda giving birth at the San Diego Zoo.  What would  a movie be without competition?  Not only must the team compete with itself, but also other news stations.  Who will win???As the title shows, Anchorman would be nothing without the supporting cast.  Sure, Ferrell has some good one-liners and funny moments, but it doesn't compare to some other parts that the other people provide.  For instance, at the beginning, they show the opening segment of how the news begins by introducing all of the sections of the news.  To see Paul Rudd walk in to the shot and start strutting was funny in itself.Christina Applegate has grown up from the Kelly Bundy era.  She in no longer a dumb, pretty, blonde girl; she is a smart, pretty, blonde girl that likes the news.  Her prescence not only made the news better, it made the film better.  She was definitely able to hold her own in the mixture of all the boys.The best character in the movie has to go to Steven Carell's Brick.  Brick mentions he has an I.Q. somewhere in the 40s, and it shows.  They made this character into a really stupid person, but that is totally ok.  He made me and the rest of the audience laugh more than anything.  Remember the scene in Bruce Almighty where Bruce makes the anchorman do really crazy things?  Well, that's who Steven Carell is.  Here, he is used to perfection.To me, the best scene in the movie involved a brawl between news teams from different channels.  This scene has a lot of cameos in it.  The main thing is the amount of laughs.  My eyes were seriously watering because I was laughing so much during this 5 to 6 minute segment and few minutes following.  It was that good.Another good scene involves Ron's dog (yet another great supporting member that saves the film).  It involves the dog having a conversation with a Kodiak bear.  My friend thought this was the best part of the movie.  I will have to agree that is was funny, although, my laughter may have been towards laughing at him for laughing so hard.  Either way, it's still funny.There were parts in the film that were not to my liking.  For instance, there was like this dream sequence that looked like something from an Adam Sandler movie.  There was also a few dry spots were it is just Ron that are kind of dull.  However, that is not enough to not recommend this film.  Overall, it was a funny movie.  If anything, go to see Steven Carell as Brick.  He's one of the characters that are supposed to be stupid and could either be seen as annoying or great.  Luckily, it worked out for the best.",4,Anchorman is nothing without supporting team,1089417600,"07 10, 2004",2004,4013,"['Will', 'Ferrell', 'back', 'silly', 'movie', 'time', 'Ferrell', 'not', 'one', 'getting', 'laughs', 'anchorman', 'better', 'believe', 'team', 'lost', 'them.The', 'story', 'little', 'telling', 'legend', 'anchorman', 'named', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'Ferrell', 'news', 'team', 'Brian', 'Fantana', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Champ', 'Kind', 'David', 'Koechner', 'Brick', 'Tamland', 'Steven', 'Carell', 'foursome', 'San', 'Diego', 'news', 'people', 'night', 'Oh', 'Burgundy', 'five', 'time', 'Emmy', 'winner', 'desk', 'job.All', 'working', 'great', 'teamwork', 'cohesiveness', 'fun', 'high-spirits', 'are', 'full', 'gear', 'Then', 'threat', 'Oh', 'woman', 'named', 'Veronica', 'Corningstone', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'Corningstone', 'quick', 'find', 'same', 'situation', 'faced', 'past', 'experiences', 'Nobody', 'woman', 'capable', 'anything', 'something', 'eyes', 'feast', 'on.It', 'out', 'Burgundy', 'Corningstone', 'share', 'more', 'professional', 'relationship', 'other', 'Bugundy', 'turning', 'team', 'quartet', 'sing', 'love', 'One', 'cooler', 'parts', 'film', 'However', 'relationship', 'ruined', 'when', 'Corningstone', 'desk', 'job', 'Burgundy', 'job', 'not', 'ruin', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'discuss', 'details', 'lead', 'up', 'moment.However', 'end', 'whole', 'team', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'catch', 'biggest', 'story', 'summer', 'panda', 'giving', 'birth', 'San', 'Diego', 'Zoo', 'What', 'would', 'movie', 'be', 'competition', 'Not', 'only', 'must', 'team', 'compete', 'also', 'other', 'news', 'stations', 'Who', 'will', 'win', 'title', 'Anchorman', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Sure', 'Ferrell', 'good', 'one-liners', 'funny', 'moments', ""n't"", 'compare', 'other', 'parts', 'other', 'people', 'provide', 'instance', 'beginning', 'show', 'opening', 'segment', 'how', 'news', 'introducing', 'sections', 'news', 'see', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'walk', 'shot', 'start', 'strutting', 'was', 'funny', 'itself.Christina', 'Applegate', 'grown', 'up', 'Kelly', 'Bundy', 'era', 'longer', 'dumb', 'pretty', 'blonde', 'girl', 'smart', 'pretty', 'blonde', 'girl', 'news', 'prescence', 'not', 'only', 'made', 'news', 'better', 'made', 'film', 'better', 'was', 'definitely', 'able', 'hold', 'own', 'mixture', 'boys.The', 'best', 'character', 'movie', 'go', 'Steven', 'Carell', 'Brick', 'Brick', 'mentions', 'I.Q', 'somewhere', '40s', 'made', 'character', 'really', 'stupid', 'person', 'totally', 'ok', 'made', 'rest', 'audience', 'more', 'anything', 'Remember', 'scene', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'where', 'Bruce', 'anchorman', 'do', 'really', 'crazy', 'things', 'Well', 'who', 'Steven', 'Carell', 'Here', 'used', 'perfection.To', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'involved', 'brawl', 'news', 'teams', 'different', 'channels', 'scene', 'lot', 'cameos', 'main', 'thing', 'amount', 'laughs', 'eyes', 'were', 'seriously', 'watering', 'was', 'laughing', 'so', 'much', '5', '6', 'minute', 'segment', 'few', 'minutes', 'following', 'was', 'good.Another', 'good', 'scene', 'Ron', 'dog', 'yet', 'great', 'supporting', 'member', 'film', 'dog', 'having', 'conversation', 'Kodiak', 'bear', 'friend', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'agree', 'was', 'funny', 'laughter', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'towards', 'laughing', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'way', 'still', 'funny.There', 'were', 'parts', 'film', 'were', 'not', 'liking', 'instance', 'was', 'dream', 'sequence', 'looked', 'something', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'few', 'dry', 'spots', 'were', 'just', 'Ron', 'are', 'kind', 'dull', 'However', 'not', 'enough', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'Overall', 'was', 'funny', 'movie', 'anything', 'go', 'see', 'Steven', 'Carell', 'Brick', 'one', 'characters', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'stupid', 'could', 'either', 'be', 'seen', 'annoying', 'great', 'Luckily', 'worked', 'out', 'best']",Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy

624451,APOUYO1BEPK22,B00005JMYI,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[0, 0]","Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is a man among men. He's got it all. Good looks, smooth moves, great suits, and the best job in the world as the number one lead Anchorman in San Diego. He even has his own entourage that consists of his fellow newsmen. Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) is the on-scene reporter, as well as a self-proclaimed ladies man. Champ Kind (David Koechner) is the sports analyst and almost a `much too close' friend of Ron's. Then there is Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) who is the weatherman and, well, lets just say `not so smart' guy of the group. They are kings of the news in San Diego, until a Veronica Cornerstone (Christina Applegate) shows up. As Veronica is trying to work her way into the camera lens, the boys are trying to keep her out. They are doing quite well, until one day when Ron has a freak accident, which lets Veronica have center stage.The first time I saw this was with two of my best friends when I was driving through Texas and stopped for a few days of having fun in San Antonio. For most of the first half of the movie, I was barely laughing, and almost not enjoying the movie. And then about 35% to 50% into the movie, it clicked. I started to get the humor. And then the movie became hysterical. I was in tears on some parts. Now after the DVD came out, I even loved the movie more. From beginning to end, I find the whole movie hilarious. I honestly can understand why some might really hate this movie. The jokes can be very dumb at times. But once you find the humor in how the jokes are delivered, it becomes golden. The things I find myself laughing at the most are how the lines are delivered, or how some of the words are annunciated. The over the top acting also helps out a lot. It's just VERY silly. The improv lines are great also. When Ron and Veronica are smiling on camera and talking, the sound is muted for the audience in the movie while the credits role, but we as the viewers get to hear them hate on each other such as Ron saying ""I'm going to hit you right in the baby maker, yep, right in the ovaries"". The movie has a slew of cameos from some very funny actors as well. Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and even Seth Rogen (not a funny part at all really, but it's funny seeing him just be a plain old camera man with like 2 lines).In the end, if you love this kind of silly comedy, then definitely own this. It never gets old.P.S. - I own the double disk feature, and have yet to watch ""the adventures of Ron Burgundy continue"" feature yet. It's supposedly a ton of extra stuff they cut out from the movie. Enough to make a completely different movie. I fast forwarded through it enough to see there is like a bank heist and everything. So I'll give it a look-see sometime soon once I get the urge to watch some more Ron Burgundy.

I can't deny that Will Ferrell is emerging as a premier comic talent in his post-SNL days, and if you aren't laughing so hard you're wiping away tears - at least a few times - then check your pulse. Yes, this movie is stupid and yes, it draws on a pretty cardboard concept for 90 minutes. But Anchorman spruces things up occasionally with wacky, oddball little additions that don't make sense but are hilarious (a violent brawl of anchormen, involving great cameos, comes to mind). Will Ferrell's first movie as the total centerpiece (Elf was a kids movie, so it's on technicality) isn't as funny as the man himself, and it would have been better to completely embrace its stupidity like the slightly better Dodgeball.

Right at the very start. Before the movie starts.I normally would go out of my way to avoid a movie that not only features Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Steve Carell etc. The latest Hollywood Rat Pack. Sometimes they can be good in movies (Shallow Hal), but mostly, they think they're funny.This has to be the first movie where they ARE funny. I was initially expecting a movie that was totally sexist. While it is totally sexist, it's cringeworthy (the outfits, the BAD hair, the facial hair), and funny (Baxter talking to Ron among others), and it's superior to all the other movies that feature the main stars. I can't really comment on Will Ferrell, I've only previously seen him in Old School (I think), and don't remember being that fussed about that film. It was something to pass the time.Unfortunately, the Christina Applegate character is a role any actress could have played. How many actresses could have got away with it though? She manages to pull off a previously stupid sounding role, and make it her own, and make it work against Will Ferrell.Anchorman is a story about the seventies. And I'm not just talking about bad hair, bad clothes, bad facial hair, bad music. It's a man's world. Women belong in the kitchen, tending to their husband's every need, making babies, while he goes out and earns the money, and eyes up the pretty girls, and regrets getting married. More specifically, it's about a woman, trying to break her way into being the first female anchorwoman on TV news. It was a very man's world apparently. But the lead male anchorman has some fatal flaws, apart from his looks - he falls for a pretty girl in a skirt, he reads ANYTHING on the teleprompter (heaven forbid, don't put a question mark at the end of a sentence that doesn't require one).

This imo is a modern classic comedy, the movie just does everything right , it's funny and has great acting from everyone involved and it features the golden age of news anchorpeople the seventies, that was the decade when women really made inroads into the field and laid the groundwork for all the top anchors that would follow. The seventies too are always a great decade to have a comedy in, it's the predigital age (1980's-) and things were in someways better than today for sure, others not. but at least they didn't have bad rap music to contend with.The characters are real enough not be believable too, after all the seventies was THe decade of excess and personal out of control freedom gone amuck. The blu ray looks stunning on all versions in this package.

We couldn't pass up the opportunity to see Steve Carrell screw up the news like he did in Bruce Almighty.Anchorman has a plot, but does anyone care?  It's mostly about Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) playing a 70s overconfident anchorman whose macho buddy-verse consisting of Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell), and Champ Kind (David Koechner) is disrupted by the promotion of Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) into their news ranks.  Mostly.Anchorman is all over the place.  It pokes fun at news shows, like how they all hate each other like 50s gangs (and imagines them duking it out with bats in alleys).  It jokes about how the intelligence requirements to become a weatherman (Brick has an IQ of 48 and is ""what some people call mentally retarded."") It mocks 70s fashion (Look at those shoes! That moustache! Those slacks!).  It painfully wrangles with the struggle of equality in the workplace.  Sometimes it's about the love between a man and a woman...and sometimes it's about the love between a man and his dog.Anchorman's a lot of things, not all of them funny.  In fact, Carrell is far funnier than Ferrell, and he has a lot less lines.  Ferrell infuses Burgundy with a vague accent that he drops in and out of.  He says all his lines like a kid play-acting in front of his high school class.  Being funny takes a lot of work, but it shouldn't look like it: Ferrell seems constipated for most of the movie.  That leaves poor Applegate to shoulder the burden, bless her heart...but she's the straightwoman, so there's not a lot she can do to help.It's hard to say a comedy is bad. Just about every movie can be funny, even unintentionally, and a judgment on quality humor is extremely subjective. I have to be honest, though: Anchorman feels lazy.  It doesn't really have a plot, the acting is terrible, and most of the jokes are beaten to brutal, bloody deaths.  I mean, jazz flute is funny and all, but after awhile you need to put the flute down and tell a joke or something.  The ending doesn't even make any sense (and it's clear, after watching what was cut, that they cut a major plot point).I love Carrell though.  His lines alone make the film worth watching.  And now that I've seen it...""I love lamp.""",2,I love...carpet. I love Carrell.

Since then he has become of the most sought after comedic stars in Hollywood, receiving offers both left and right and there appears to be no sign of him slowing down anytime soon.As with most sketch comedy films, the story doesn?t matter as much to the audience as the laughs are all that seem to matter but Anchorman at least attempts, unlike so many others, to the plot it starts off with. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy takes movie-goers back to the 1970s when Ron Burgundy was San Diego?s top-rated news anchor and only men were allowed to read the news. But the times are changing and when an ambitious female reporter, Veronica Corningstone, comes to the Channel 4 newsroom, Ron?s world begins to change and not to his liking. At first, Veronica is given ?female? oriented interest stories, like cat fashion shows, and is kept out the lime-light for the most part. But one day, Ron fails to show up to report the news on time and Veronica takes his place, only to receive her big break and become co-anchor. Things just continue to get worse the more Ron fights the fact that he is no longer San Diego?s top anchorman. The story for Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy may not be the most accurate representation of the era at the time but it does manage to touch on some issues, as in the rise of feminism, that were of importance in the 1970s, although the film does not take them as seriously as they were in real life. But bottom-line is that film plays for laughs and nothing presented in this film should be taken seriously, except perhaps the representation of news anchors that are often seen on the local news today.The cast of Anchorman consists of mainly of actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live!, whether they be current or former members, as well as several others that are well accustomed to sketch comedy of this nature. Will Ferrell, who proved to Hollywood that he was comedic driving force to be reckoned with thanks to his holiday smash-hit, Elf, owns the show as the title character, Ron Burgundy. This film proves to many that Ferrell is one of the best comedic minds in the business today as he is able to turn even the dumbest material into something funny ? it may not be gut-busting but it doesn?t come off as stupid as it should, which is all that matters to move the film along. Christina Applegate performs reasonably in the role of Veronica Corningstone, the female newswoman who threatens Ron Burgundy?s news world. It wasn?t that she doesn?t work well in the film; there are severely scenes between her and Will Ferrell that are particularly funny. The problem is that most of the material given to her isn?t as funny as it should be. Often she is too dependant on someone like Will Ferrell to help make the scene humorous and when it comes to a scene by herself, it doesn?t have the same impact as the rest of the film. David Koechner?s Champ Kind, the sports reporting cowboy, is one of the bigger disappointments and becomes a character that should have been entirely cut from the film as his material is more trite and annoying then anything else. Steve Carell?s Brick Tamland, the mentally retarded weatherman, is one of the biggest highlights of the film and, yes, there is a jab at the Bush administration with his character (what kind of Hollywood production would it be without one of those?) but other then that, he draws some of the biggest laughs of the film. And what would a comedy such as this be without celebrity cameos? Though many of the jokes of Anchorman don?t live up to other comedies, this is one area where it probably rises above anything else in the past few years, including the opening segment of Austin Powers in Goldmember. Without giving away anything, pay attention to the street-fight sequence or you may miss someone.Overall, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is dumb, immature, and lacks the consistency and technique of vastly superior comedies of the past such as Austin Powers but in a summer severely lacking in anything remotely humorous, it does the job its meant to do, making us laugh, even if years from now it will be long forgotten. One of the film?s main problems is that there isn?t anything excessively amusing. There are certain parts of the film that are certainly humorous, most notably the street-fight sequence between the numerous news teams, but they are few and far between. For the most part Anchorman relies on monotonous toilet humor that becomes old and tired the more they use it. It doesn?t get to the point where it makes the film intolerable but it does graze the line a bit. Another problem wasn?t what was seen but rather it was the material that wasn?t shown in the comedy. Remember the film?s trailer? Some of the trailer?s more entertaining moments don?t make into the film (?Well, I?m getting a divorce and I may never see my kids again? ? ?Fantastic!?) but according to the film?s director, he ended up with about four hours worth of material which may all end up on a special edition DVD when its released later this year. The point is, despite those minor complaints, Anchorman is a pure, dumb comedy that doesn?t expect to be anything more then entertaining, even if it fails to be all that memorable. In a year that has certainly lacked its share of quality comedies, let alone decent ones, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is one class act and worth the price of admission this summer.",4,The

Unfortunately, in my opinion, the ""unrated"" version is inferior to the theatrical version and the only way you can see the theatrical version anymore is in the crappy full-screen, pan & scan format.One of my favorite scenes in the movie (the boardroom scene where the news team discusses their hangovers from the previous night's party) is replaced with an alternate version that was ""edgier"" and ""unrated"", but less funny.Also, the only real extended part of the movie is where the ""once beloved"" Ron Burgundy is now down-on-his-luck, eating a cat turd in the restaurant that he used to be an honored guest in.  It's a bit much and I think it takes away from the movie (which is probably the reason it wasn't included in the theatrical version) but hey, it's ""unrated"" so I guess that makes it funnier right?But that's just my opinion. You may like the ""Unrated, Uncut, and Uncalled For"" version better - I just don't - but for some reason the only way I can see the version that I want to see is if it's in the retarded full-screen DVD format (why do they even make these anymore?).

In San Diego, that king was Ron Burgundy, a ladies' man, man's man, man about town. Ron loved his city, and his city loved him. This all changed when the first female anchor came onto the scene. When Ron met Veronica Corningstone, it was love at first sight, but his male-chauvinist, co-worker pals, Champ Kind of Sports, on-the-scene reporter Brian Fantana, and mentally challenged weatherman Brick, weren't ready to give up their friend, or their newsroom, without a fight. When Ron and Veronica's fledgling relationship suddenly goes sour as a result of her promotion to a lead anchor, the boys are happy again to have Ron back as their leader, until Veronica exacts her revenge and turns the entire city against him!While his best film thus far would have to be the charming, stylish, instant Christmas classic ""Elf,"" ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" may always be considered the quintessential Will Ferrell comedy. Hilariously silly 99.9% of the time and recapturing the tackiness of the '70s throughout, if you love comedy and Will Ferrell, this film is a must have. The ensemble cast features some of the best comedic actors of the 21st century in both major and minor roles, from Steve Carell as Brick Tamland to Fred Willard as newsroom chief Ed Harkin; from Christina Applegate as Veronica Corningstone to Jack Black as a very angry biker! The humor is random and unpredictable, the performances are spot on, the ""Afternoon Delight"" scene is unforgettably funny, and yes, there's a story too. Good stuff all around!The Unrated, Widescreen DVD doesn't disappoint much in the extras department either. Granted, the DVD commentary is mostly a waste of time. It's basically just Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay cracking wise about everything BUT the movie, which they hardly even talk about, along with some other cast members (a few simply call in) and some completely unrelated guests.

Ahead of possibly going to see the sequel, I watched the original one the other evening at the strong recommendation of my 26 yr. old son, who had been telling me I was missing out.&#34;Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy&#34; (2004 release; 94 min.) brings the story or Burgundy (played by Will Ferrell) and the rest of the 6 pm news team at Channel 4 in 1970s San Diego. The main news story is that a giant panda at the San Diego Zoo is pregnant. One day, in order to advance &#34;diversity&#34; (which Burgundy thinks is &#34;an old wooden ship used in the Civil War era&#34;), an ambitious woman (played by Christina Applegate) is added to the news team. Chaos ensues after that on all fronts. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, given the huge reputation as a &#34;can't miss, classic&#34; that this movies now carries, I was prepared to be disappointed, but it turns out to be pretty good. The zingers fly almost non-stop left and right, some of which stick, others not so much, but it leaves you smiling most of the time. Second, even though this is of course a Will Ferrell vehicle (he co-wrote the script), the big surprise for me was Christina Applegate, who more than holds her own in this male-dominated cast. When she gets into a huge argument at one point, she screams &#34;I'm good at 3 things: fighting, screwing, and reading the news!&#34;, and you more than believe her. Steve Carrell is brilliant as the simple-minded side-kick. And what a surprise to see Seth Rogen in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance (one of his first roles ever), as well as Ben Stiller (he at least gets a few minutes of screen time).Bottom line: this is a funny comedy that had me smiling much of the time as I was watching this. After seeing this, I cannot even imagine that the sequel can be anywhere near as good as this, and the reported 2 hr. running time of the sequel seems incredibly long. I guess I'll find out for myself in the next few days.

Christina Applegate does a good job too as the woman anchor who all the men try to pick up in very perverted sexual ways. you'll laugh so hard. The crew is jealous of the new female reporter and try to do everything to fire her with some obnoxious and funny scenes.

Christina does the news and all hell breaks loose between the two of them and they start exchanging nasty words to each other and  physically fighting by throwing things at each other.  Finally Christina gets back at Ron by writing something on the teleprompt that Ron isn't supposed to read but does without noticing, which is hilarious.  This fuels more anger between the two makes for more funny scenes to come.  Ben Stiller has a cameo as a Mexical news anchor, Tim Robbins another cameo,  and Vince Vaughn is good too.

In the 1970s, chauvinistic news anchorman Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) and his cocky Channel 4 buddies are the most popular news team in San Diego. When competent news journalist Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) becomes the station's first female co-anchor, Burgundy plots to get rid of his new coworker at all cost. ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" is a marvelously entertaining comedy with great comic talent. The fun-filled summer comedy has a likable story, hilarious characters and some wildly amusing laughs. Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate have great onscreen comic chemistry. ""Anchorman"" also features a great supporting cast including Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Steve Carell, Fred Willard and Vince Vaughn, and funny appearances by Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller and Jack Black.If you can't get enough of Will Ferrell, then ""Anchorman"" Extended Edition is right for you. The enjoyable comedy is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD has an enjoyable video transfer with good resolution, and a pleasant Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. This extended edition contains a decent audio commentary, numerous deleted scenes, funny outtakes, a short behind-the-scenes documentary and some side-splitting featurettes like ""Ron Burgundy's MTV Music Awards Interviews"" and ""Ron Burgundy's ESPN Audition"".

All is going well for Ron Burgundy until the station manager decides the newscast needs a bit more ""diversity"" and hires a female reporter named Veronica Cornerstone (Christina Applegate) to come on board.  Cornerstone is a brainy, blow-dried blonde with a driving ambition to be the first female anchor on network news.  Since most of the men who work at the station, including Burgundy, are dyed-in-the-wool misogynists, Ms. Cornerstone faces an uphill battle of sexist comments, schoolboy pranks, and subtle (and not so subtle) undermining as she climbs her way to the top (though she is not above pulling a few dirty tricks herself to get what she wants).  Things really get dicey when Burgundy and Cornerstone begin dating and quickly fall in love, a situation rife with potential disaster as Cornerstone begins to encroach on Burgundy's professional territory.""Anchorman"" is a light-hearted, enjoyable little comedy that, unlike a full-throated satire (say, like ""Network""), often goes for the easy laugh instead of the incisive barb.  The movie is at its best when it is parodying the corny graphics and the tendency to over hype the trivial (""Panda Watch: Day 46"") that define modern newscasts - and at its worst when it is indulging in silly, often scatological jokes and slapstick throw away bits.  Like most mainstream comedies, the humor in ""Anchorman"" ranges from the mildly funny to the downright hilarious, the latter including a clever ""West Side Story"" parody involving a rumble between rival news teams, and a conversation between a dog and a bear that ends the movie on a ludicrous but knee-slapping high note.Ferrell (who co-wrote the film) is his usual manic self, unctuous but likable, and Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, David Koechner, and Fred Willard do fine work in supporting roles.  Moreover, writer/director Adam McKay provides a smattering of guest appearances from such well known stars as Jack Black, Luke Wilson, Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn, Jerry Stiller and even Ben Stiller, many of who are not listed in the official credits.""Anchorman"" goes down easily - a bit too easily, perhaps, for a film that, with a little more courage, might have become a scathing satire on an industry that could do with a little merciless skewering right about now.  Still, ""Anchorman"" is fun while it lasts - and these days we'll settle for what we can get when it comes to laughs.",3,more a pleasant parody than a biting satire,1125705600,"09 3, 2005",2005,2885,"['***1/2', 'Anchorman', 'Legend', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'back', 'halcyon', 'days', '1970', 'when', 'hair', 'was', 'as', 'big', 'lapels', 'women', 'were', 'just', 'beginning', 'assume', 'rightful', 'place', 'America', 'television', 'newsrooms.Will', 'Ferrell', 'Ted', 'Baxter-type', 'anchorman', 'mere', 'coincidence', 'dog', 'named', 'Baxter', 'vain', 'narcissistic', 'none', 'too', 'gifted', 'brains', 'department', 'who', 'worked', 'years', 'sole', 'news', 'dispenser', 'top-rated', 'San', 'Diego', 'station', 'going', 'well', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'station', 'manager', 'newscast', 'bit', 'more', 'diversity', 'female', 'reporter', 'named', 'Veronica', 'Cornerstone', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'come', 'board', 'Cornerstone', 'brainy', 'blow-dried', 'blonde', 'driving', 'ambition', 'be', 'first', 'female', 'anchor', 'network', 'news', 'most', 'men', 'who', 'work', 'station', 'including', 'Burgundy', 'are', 'dyed-in-the-wool', 'misogynists', 'Ms', 'Cornerstone', 'uphill', 'battle', 'sexist', 'comments', 'schoolboy', 'pranks', 'subtle', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'undermining', 'way', 'top', 'not', 'pulling', 'few', 'dirty', 'tricks', 'get', 'what', 'Things', 'really', 'get', 'dicey', 'when', 'Burgundy', 'Cornerstone', 'begin', 'dating', 'quickly', 'fall', 'love', 'situation', 'rife', 'potential', 'disaster', 'Cornerstone', 'encroach', 'Burgundy', 'professional', 'territory', 'Anchorman', 'light-hearted', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'comedy', 'full-throated', 'satire', 'say', 'Network', 'often', 'easy', 'laugh', 'instead', 'incisive', 'barb', 'movie', 'best', 'when', 'parodying', 'corny', 'graphics', 'tendency', 'trivial', 'Panda', 'Watch', 'Day', '46', 'define', 'modern', 'newscasts', 'worst', 'when', 'indulging', 'silly', 'often', 'scatological', 'jokes', 'slapstick', 'throw', 'away', 'bits', 'most', 'mainstream', 'comedies', 'humor', 'Anchorman', 'mildly', 'funny', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'latter', 'including', 'clever', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'parody', 'involving', 'rumble', 'rival', 'news', 'teams', 'conversation', 'dog', 'bear', 'movie', 'ludicrous', 'knee-slapping', 'high', 'note.Ferrell', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'film', 'usual', 'manic', 'self', 'unctuous', 'likable', 'Applegate', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'David', 'Koechner', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'do', 'fine', 'work', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Moreover', 'writer/director', 'Adam', 'McKay', 'smattering', 'guest', 'appearances', 'such', 'well', 'known', 'stars', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'Jerry', 'Stiller', 'even', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'many', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'listed', 'official', 'credits', 'Anchorman', 'down', 'easily', 'bit', 'too', 'easily', 'perhaps', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'courage', 'might', 'have', 'become', 'scathing', 'satire', 'industry', 'could', 'do', 'little', 'merciless', 'skewering', 'right', 'about', 'now', 'Still', 'Anchorman', 'fun', 'days', ""'ll"", 'settle', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'when', 'laughs']",Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy

624532,A6FIAB28IS79,B00005JMYI,Samuel Chell,"[1, 5]","Al Franken, Molly Shannon, Chris Farley, Will McDonald, Dana Garvey, Mike Meyers, Adam Sandler, and now Will Ferrell--why do these talented performers dependably crack me up on their SNL 10-minute bits yet leave me constantly looking at my watch during their feature-length movie offerings? Well, for one thing the writing is atrocious--thinly disguised, formulaic soapers with a few ""F"" words and whoopee cushion jokes thrown in to justify the length and venue. Characterization is nil--apparently a viewer's prior familiarity with the on-screen personas is considered sufficient--and plots are mono-dramatic situations used as excuses for lame (and loud) verbal and sight gags.In the case of ""Anchorman"" the title says it all. Ferrell plays a vain and fatuous television news anchor whose chief attribute is his hair, which is suddenly under threat by a foxy woman rival with both brains and hair (no matter that the sexist situations and dialogue are at least 30 years out of date). For no reason other than dramatic necessity the two competitive anchors get their act together both romantically and professionally by the end of the movie (which came 60 minutes too late for this viewer).Just to show you how short this film is on creative ideas, the highlight for me was the voice-over narration supplied by CBS and cable news commentator Bill Kurtis. A close second would be a 5-second out-take from ""Smokey and the Bandit Part 2."" A 3rd would be Tim Robbins' walk-on as a ruthlessly ambitious PBS rep.I'll be curious to to see how well this film does. Pre-college kids probably won't get the political humor of the opening sketches; college kids couldn't care less; adults find SNL humor, at least since the Belushi-Akroyd days, way beneath them. I have a hunch the makers of this film might wish they had chosen to invest their money in something like ""Fear Factor: The Movie.""I'm giving the film 3 stars because of Farrell's great comedic potential (he's actually a pretty good musician and dancer) and because he mercifully spared us that noxious cheerleading bit, which is as unfunny as any SNL sketch I've ever seen. Also, his ""in character"" interviews in promoting the film were so subtle he had me believing I was watching some of the anchormen from my youth in northern Wisconsin. Finally, the only other spectator in the theater--my wife--claimed that she liked the movie.",3,What do you expect?

624538,AR1T36GLLAFFX,B00005JMYI,Scott FS,"[0, 0]","I finally got to see this Will Ferrell vehicle.  Parts of the film were just hilarious, parts not so much, some gross (well, more than some, but we're talking Will Ferrel here), and some tender and romantic (just kidding!).With over 400 reviews here, I'm not going to re-state the plot or comment on much other than my over-all reaction to the film.  First of all, if you're a Ferrell fan, this is a must-see.  Even if you're not, it's worth the price of admission.  Ferrell is his typical over-grown teenager (again) in Anchorman.  He plays a man-child who is vain, dumb, clueless, awkward, and somewhat sentimental.  He loves his dog, his own mug, his friends, and not much else.There are fights, sing-alongs, dog punting, dog survival, bikers, women-libbers, homoeroticism, cute girls, sterile apartments, teleprompters, and a zoo.Mildly recommended.  If the film were edited down a bit to get rid of some of the more stupid scenes (arms getting ripped off, a wild melee between news crews), this would be a better film.  Ferrell is terrifically talented, but only in a set way.  One can compare Ferrell with another SNL alumnus, Bill Murray.  Murray shows range in films such as 'The Razor's Edge' and 'Lost in Translation'.  One cannot imagine Ferrell pulling off either of those films.Three-and-a-half stars for 'Anchorman'.",4,"Wildly Uneven, But Very Funny in Spots",1290211200,"11 20, 2010",2010,1330,"['finally', 'got', 'see', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'vehicle', 'Parts', 'film', 'were', 'just', 'hilarious', 'parts', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'gross', 'well', 'more', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Will', 'Ferrel', 'here', 'tender', 'romantic', 'just', 'kidding', '.With', '400', 'reviews', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 're-state', 'plot', 'comment', 'much', 'other', 'over-all', 'reaction', 'film', 'First', 'all', ""'re"", 'Ferrell', 'fan', 'must-see', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'price', 'admission', 'Ferrell', 'typical', 'over-grown', 'teenager', 'again', 'Anchorman', 'man-child', 'who', 'vain', 'dumb', 'clueless', 'awkward', 'somewhat', 'sentimental', 'dog', 'own', 'mug', 'friends', 'not', 'much', 'are', 'fights', 'sing-alongs', 'dog', 'punting', 'dog', 'survival', 'bikers', 'women-libbers', 'homoeroticism', 'cute', 'girls', 'sterile', 'apartments', 'teleprompters', 'zoo.Mildly', 'recommended', 'film', 'were', 'edited', 'down', 'bit', 'get', 'rid', 'more', 'stupid', 'scenes', 'arms', 'getting', 'ripped', 'off', 'wild', 'melee', 'news', 'crews', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'film', 'Ferrell', 'terrifically', 'talented', 'only', 'set', 'way', 'One', 'can', 'compare', 'Ferrell', 'SNL', 'alumnus', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Murray', 'range', 'films', 'such', ""'The"", 'Razor', 'Edge', ""'Lost"", 'Translation', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'Ferrell', 'pulling', 'off', 'films.Three-and-a-half', 'stars', ""'Anchorman""]",Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy

624540,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JMYI,Scott Schiefelbein,"[0, 0]","""Anchorman - The Legend of Ron Burgundy,"" may be an ""Adam McKay film,"" but this is Will Farrell's beast from start to finish.  Arguably the best performer ever on ""Saturday Night Live,"" Farrell has made a career out of bringing hilariously ridiculous characters alive.  Ron Burgundy is another such creation.Set in the 1970's, in an America on the cusp of new ""fads"" like feminism, jogging, and environmental awareness, ""Anchorman"" charts the fall and redemption of Ron Burgundy, San Diego's top anchorman.  As the title character, Farrell brings his unique brand of hilarious sincerity to one of his most befuddled characters.  Ask yourself -- could any actor bring more to the line, ""San Diego, as everyone knows, was founded by Germans in 1904""?  If you love Will Farrell, you are sure to like, and quite possibly love ""Anchorman.""Burgundy and his ""crack news team,"" which includes Paul Rudd as the horny roving reporter Brian Fontana and Steve Carell (""The Office"") as weatherman Brick Tamland -- and Carell plumbs the depths of how low the bar is set for weathermen in San Diego, rule San Diego's TV screens.  But trouble hits paradise when Burgundy's boss Ed Harkin (played by the always perfect Fred Willard -- although he's given surprisingly little to do) is instructed by ""corporate"" to bring on . . . gasp! . . . a woman!  Yes, feminism hits the newsroom in the beautiful form of Ms. Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate, proving that she is worthy of overcoming her ""Married With Children"" legacy).  Can Burgundy and his pals tolerate this desecration of the male bastion that is the newsroom?  How can Burgundy reconcile his professional pride with his raging lust for the delectable Ms. Corningstone?  Can Burgundy woo the resisting Ms. Corningstone with his fiery jazz flute performance?  Of such false drama is hilarious comedy made.One can easily imagine Will Farrell and his buddies cranking this movie idea out over a long weekend of beer and pizza.  Many of the jokes are indeed inspired.  Look for some hilarious references to ""West Side Story"" as the news teams from different networks get together to ""rumble.""  Vince Vaughan leads the second-tier news team with comic timing that proves that ""Swingers"" was no fluke.  (From this insanely funny idea we get wonderful cameos from Luke Wilson as the anchor from the third-tier newsroom, from Tim Robbins as the anchor from PBS (of course), and from Ben Stiller as the anchor from the Spanish newschannel.  Genius!)  Who else could conjure up a cologne named ""Sex Panther"" that ""smells like pure gasoline""?  Who else could dream up a beloved pooch who wears a head-gear retainer to bed and speaks with bears?  The comic talent at work here is dazzling (look for another inspired cameo from Jack Black, by the way).Still, at the end of the day, ""Anchorman"" leaves one unsatisfied.  Perhaps its because the movie is so darn short -- even the ""uncut, unrated"" version clocks in at barely over 90 minutes, and that's with filler.  True, a lean, mean comedy is better than a bloated gasbag, but this movie is so lean that it borders on emaciated.  Or perhaps it's because the cast of the movie is so darn good that the expectations can't be met.  Whatever the reason, ""Anchorman"" does not rise to the level of beloved comedies.Full disclosure -- I was on the floor laughing when Vince Vaughan's character was introduced as ""Wes Mantooth,"" which is the name of one of my best childhood friends.  To hear that name attached to that character had me in stitches.Another point -- this is the ""unrated uncut"" version of the movie, but unlike so many other comedies, ""unrated and uncut"" does not translate into ""more T&A.;""  I am not a prude by any means, but too many ""comedies"" use nudity to cover up the fact that the movie just ain't that funny.  ""Anchorman"" is refreshingly nudity-free, choosing to go for real laughs rather than blatant titilation.  The language, while coarse, also generally refrains from profanity, with one funny exception.Check out ""Anchorman"" for some huge, if isolated laughs.  I cannot say this is a ""must for the film library,"" but you should definitely see it.",3,"Funny Moments, yet Less Than the Sum of Parts",1118620800,"06 13, 2005",2005,4157,"['Anchorman', 'Legend', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'may', 'be', 'Adam', 'McKay', 'film', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'beast', 'start', 'finish', 'Arguably', 'best', 'performer', 'ever', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Farrell', 'made', 'career', 'bringing', 'hilariously', 'ridiculous', 'characters', 'alive', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'such', 'creation.Set', '1970', 'America', 'cusp', 'new', 'fads', 'feminism', 'jogging', 'environmental', 'awareness', 'Anchorman', 'fall', 'redemption', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'San', 'Diego', 'top', 'anchorman', 'title', 'character', 'Farrell', 'unique', 'brand', 'hilarious', 'sincerity', 'one', 'most', 'befuddled', 'characters', 'Ask', 'could', 'actor', 'bring', 'more', 'line', 'San', 'Diego', 'everyone', 'was', 'founded', 'Germans', '1904', 'love', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'are', 'sure', 'like', 'quite', 'possibly', 'love', 'Anchorman', 'Burgundy', 'crack', 'news', 'team', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'horny', 'roving', 'reporter', 'Brian', 'Fontana', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Office', 'weatherman', 'Brick', 'Tamland', 'Carell', 'plumbs', 'depths', 'how', 'low', 'bar', 'set', 'weathermen', 'San', 'Diego', 'rule', 'San', 'Diego', 'TV', 'screens', 'trouble', 'hits', 'paradise', 'when', 'Burgundy', 'boss', 'Ed', 'Harkin', 'played', 'always', 'perfect', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'given', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'do', 'instructed', 'corporate', 'bring', 'gasp', 'woman', 'Yes', 'feminism', 'newsroom', 'beautiful', 'form', 'Ms.', 'Veronica', 'Corningstone', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'proving', 'worthy', 'overcoming', 'Married', 'Children', 'legacy', 'Can', 'Burgundy', 'pals', 'tolerate', 'desecration', 'male', 'bastion', 'newsroom', 'How', 'can', 'Burgundy', 'reconcile', 'professional', 'pride', 'raging', 'lust', 'delectable', 'Ms.', 'Corningstone', 'Can', 'Burgundy', 'woo', 'resisting', 'Ms.', 'Corningstone', 'fiery', 'jazz', 'flute', 'performance', 'such', 'false', 'drama', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'made.One', 'can', 'easily', 'imagine', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'buddies', 'cranking', 'movie', 'idea', 'out', 'long', 'weekend', 'beer', 'pizza', 'Many', 'jokes', 'are', 'indeed', 'inspired', 'Look', 'hilarious', 'references', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'news', 'teams', 'different', 'networks', 'get', 'together', 'rumble', 'Vince', 'Vaughan', 'second-tier', 'news', 'team', 'comic', 'timing', 'Swingers', 'was', 'fluke', 'insanely', 'funny', 'idea', 'get', 'wonderful', 'cameos', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'anchor', 'third-tier', 'newsroom', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'anchor', 'PBS', 'course', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'anchor', 'Spanish', 'newschannel', 'Genius', 'Who', 'else', 'could', 'conjure', 'up', 'cologne', 'named', 'Sex', 'Panther', 'smells', 'pure', 'gasoline', 'Who', 'else', 'could', 'dream', 'up', 'beloved', 'pooch', 'who', 'head-gear', 'retainer', 'bed', 'speaks', 'bears', 'comic', 'talent', 'work', 'here', 'dazzling', 'look', 'inspired', 'cameo', 'Jack', 'Black', 'way', '.Still', 'end', 'day', 'Anchorman', 'one', 'unsatisfied', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'so', 'darn', 'short', 'even', 'uncut', 'unrated', 'version', 'clocks', 'barely', '90', 'minutes', 'filler', 'True', 'lean', 'mean', 'comedy', 'better', 'bloated', 'gasbag', 'movie', 'so', 'lean', 'emaciated', 'perhaps', 'cast', 'movie', 'so', 'darn', 'good', 'expectations', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'met', 'reason', 'Anchorman', 'not', 'rise', 'level', 'beloved', 'comedies.Full', 'disclosure', 'was', 'floor', 'laughing', 'when', 'Vince', 'Vaughan', 'character', 'was', 'introduced', 'Wes', 'Mantooth', 'name', 'one', 'best', 'childhood', 'friends', 'hear', 'name', 'attached', 'character', 'had', 'stitches.Another', 'point', 'unrated', 'uncut', 'version', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'comedies', 'unrated', 'uncut', 'not', 'translate', 'more', 'T', 'A', 'am', 'not', 'prude', 'means', 'too', 'many', 'comedies', 'use', 'nudity', 'cover', 'up', 'fact', 'movie', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Anchorman', 'refreshingly', 'nudity-free', 'choosing', 'go', 'real', 'laughs', 'rather', 'blatant', 'titilation', 'language', 'coarse', 'also', 'generally', 'profanity', 'one', 'funny', 'out', 'Anchorman', 'huge', 'isolated', 'laughs', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'must', 'film', 'library', 'should', 'definitely', 'see']",Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy

This is absolutely the worst I've ever seen from any of those folks I mentioned, with the possible exception of Ben Stiller's dismal character in DODGEBALL. The main setting harks back to one of the most better left forgotten eras in American history, when Helen Reddy was more than ready to give us hell, stirring up the cesspools of meaningless dissent, singing ""I am woman, hear me roar"", when the ""sitcom"" was born as a means of dubious entertainment, and men were portrayed as feeble-minded, and women were portrayed as poeple who like to assault the feeble-minded. It was an era that could have gladly come to an end (which it still hasn't completely yet) but this movie is a striking example of something determined to dredge it up and make us live it all over again. The male lead (I won't say hero), in  trying to court the female lead (I won't say heroine), utters a line so stupid it challenges how stupid something can be and still succeed, even in a farce. He says that ""San Diego"" is German for ""whale's vagina"". I am very much up for irreverent humor and certainly no nice Nelly. But when I heard that, I couldn't laugh. I just felt embarrassed to be of the same species that created such an inane attempt at humor. And that was in the relatively reality-grounded part of the movie! From there it shoots off in all different directions of screwball comedy, none of them really working or failing to clash with one another. There's a scene where anchormen from competing stations slash it out medieval-style with a motley assortment of weapons that they pull out of nowhere. That's where most of the cameos come in. We're supposed to find it funny when one guy gets an arm cut off in the brawl! This movie hasn't earned the right to tack on an ending that it would wish to make us care about. It would be better left seething in its own quagmire of manifold impertinancies. But, you guessed it. It puts a cliff-hanger ending on the end like we were supposed to care about its main characters as heroes. During that ending we're supposed to find it funny when the same guy who previously got an arm cut off gets his other arm cut off. Man, is this movie a desperately unfunny kind of ""one-upmanship"" or what? The cliffhanger ending has people falling into a bear pit at a zoo -- people the movie never made us care about before, but we're expected to go along, radically shifting gears into caring about them now. Could one more disparate clashing category of dumb humor be dragged into this mess? Yes! The way the ending is resolved is by a lost dog showing up and having an ability to engage in dialogue with bears!

He's a local legend, his station is number 1, and even little kids know who Ron Burgundy is. However, to add more diversity to the news, they hire a female, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate of 'Married with Children') to the team. Eventually, she becomes co-anchor with Burgundy. We now have the typical battle of the sexes going on, while they both try to get the lead anchor position.There are some good cameos by Vince Vaugn, who will always come in second place to Ferrell's TV ratings, Ben Stiller, who plays a Hispanic anchorman, and Jack Black, the angry biker who gets a burrito thrown at him by Burgundy. The funniest character in this movie, no, not Ferrell, but Steve Carell who plays the clueless weatherman, Brick Tamland.

Will Farrell stars as Ron Burgundy - scotch loving, smooth haired, charming, big fish in a small pond newscaster in 1970s San Diego, loved by all with his catchprase 'Stay Classy San Diego'. He bestrides a ludicrous team of reporters such as the retarded weatherman Brick and sexist primal jackass reporter Brian. This absurd assembly is shattered by the arrival of the stereotypically glamorous Veronica Corningstone. Ron preposterously seduces her, despite her obvious intial misgivings and this upsets the boys culture around the newsroom. Things go badly wrong for Will after he accidently hits a moustacioed biker with a burrito, leading ultimately to Veronica taking over as chief anchor.The movie is, primarily, a comedy, and it is funny. So it succeeds. But it could have been so much better. Instead of being a tight, acerbic satire of early feminist breakthroughs in sexist, boys dominated 1970s institutions. Instead, it is dominated by Farrell (who tailored the script himself) to such an extent that it becomes a showcase for him to experiment with all his goofy comic talent. Thus the comedy falls from the rank of those that are both funny and meaningful and holds itself shabbily together as a reduculous goofball romp.

In early 1970's San Diego, anchorman, Ron Burgundy, and his news team are on top.  The whole city loves them as they continue to hold the top spot in the ratings(Super duper!).  However, just when everything seems to be going the right way, a female anchor/field reporter, Veronica Corningstone, is hired.  Burgundy and his news team will stop at nothing to get rid of Corningstone so that the Channel 4 news office can return back to normal.  Not everyone will enjoy this type of humor, but if you're a fan of Will Ferrell, you will love this movie.  Plenty of off-the-wall humor, too many great lines to even mention, and some of the worst hairstyles you'll ever see.  One particularly hilarious scene, with some great cameos, has Burgundy and Co. duking it out with all the other channel's news teams in a no-holds barred street fight.  Not all the jokes work, but the ones that do are hysterical.  Highly recommended comedy about a different time that will have you rolling around.Will Ferrell is hilarious as chauvinistic Channel 4 in San Diego anchorman, Ron Burgundy.  His character, even when arrogant and cocky, is still likable.  He fully embodies the man who reads from the teleprompter without thinking, which ends up getting him in trouble.  Christina Applegate is also very good as co-anchor, Veronica Corningstone, who tries to survive in a male-dominated news office.  The rest of the news team includes Paul Rudd as ladies man and field reporter, Brian Fantana, Steven Carell in a great part as weatherman, Brick Tambland, who has an IQ of 48, and David Koechner as sports anchor, Champ Kind.  The always funny Fred Willard plays Ed Harken, the head of the news office.  I won't say who the cameos are because it is so funny to see them in their parts, much of the time unexpectedly.

Each character is steriotypical but to the extreme, mix that is with the quirky personalities, and you have an undeniably funny cast. Will Ferrell stars as Ron Burgundy, the top-rated anchorman in San Diego in the `70s. Feminism marches into the newsroom in the form of ambitious newswoman Veronica Corningstone Ron is willing to play along at first-as long as Veronica stays in her place, covering cat fashion shows, cooking, and other ""female"" interests. But when Veronica refuses to settle for being eye candy and steps behind the news desk, it's more than a battle between two perfectly coiffed anchor-persons...well it's all out war. The comedic take on a woman invading the news desk in the 1970s was inspired by a decidedly more serious documentary on the women who actually broke that glass ceiling.

How a movie could so waste the comedic talents of Will Ferrell is beyond me. The main problem with the movie is that it is NOT FUNNY!  I was expecting to be in stitches as I am with most Will Ferrell comedy pieces but I don't think we genuinely laughed one time.  The movie was boring and at times gross (as they desperatly try for laughs by stooping to toilet humor which is gross but not funny).  I also usually love Vince Vaughn in his smart ass side kick rolls (see Old School!).  However, in this movie his part is small and his part has none of the wise ass humor I love from him.As much as it pains me to say this, save your money (don't rent this movie and sure as heck don't BUY it)because you will probably feel cheated.

ANCHORMAN was a movie that Ferrell helped write and his comic touch is all over the screen play.  Ferrell can get laughs, but he also knows when to restrain himself and not play things so over the top. In fact, in some ways Ferrell is one of the most British American comic actors around.The subtitle of ANCHORMAN is ""The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" because the main character in the story is Burgundy (Ferrell).  Burgundy is the lead anchor for channel 4 news in San Diego during the mid 1970s.  The people of the city love him and he is adored everywhere he goes. But Burgundy lives a very lonely life, spending most of his nights alone at home talking to his dog Baxter.  Burgundy's closest friends are his co-workers from the station: reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), and sports reporter Champ Kind (David Koechner).  The four friends make a formidable group and are the top rated news team in San Diego.Burgundy's life changes the day that Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) appears at a Channel 4 party. Burgundy immediately falls for the mysterious woman but she leaves him cold. The next day Burgundy and company learn that the studio heads have hired Corningstone as a bow to the changing times as their newest reporter.  What follows is one bizarre boy meets girl story and a slight warning about romantic relationships in the workplace.When I first saw the previews for ANCHORMAN, I thought it was going to be a dumb movie like DODGEBALL. However, as noted earlier, Ferrell knows when to draw the line and though there are a few sexual jokes [...],the movie isn't that raunchy. Ferrell, well, Will Ferrell is Will Ferrell and he's a great comedian. Applegate turns in a great performance as the lovestruck/career-ladder climbing Corningstone. Steve Carell steals just about every scene he is as the mentally-challenged Tamland, as does the Burgundy's dog Baxter.ANCHORMAN has a fun time mixing up movie genres and throwing in pop culture references. In one of the best scenes of the movie, a major gang fight breaks out between the news teams at the 3 major networks, the public broadcast station, and the Hispanic station. During the fight, movie references as varied as PLANET OF THE APES and SPARTACUS are thrown in.  Later in the movie, Baxter, in a Lassie-like moment, saves some people from being ripped to shreds by a ferocious bear. Nevertheless, even with such humorous scenes such as these, ANCHORMAN remains like a typical boy meets girl story.

He has his posse of news men and together they rule.  However while holding an office party (at his place no less) he meets Veronica (Christina Applegate), a young woman who inspires to be a news anchor.  Ron falls in love with her but his over inflated ego (and stupidity) eventually gets him into trouble not only with her, but with the news station as well.

It's not quite a classic, but it's a silly, perverse, and occasionally surreal adult farce that effectively exploits the same formula that made Caddyshack a favorite among young guys everywhere: twisted characters, oddball dialogue, and a few lowbrow gags to keep everyone loose.  Even more importantly, it doesn't try too hard or wear out its welcome (having sat through Wedding Crashers in the theatre, I can attest that mainstream comedies shouldn't run past 100 minutes; this one clocks in at a highly palatable 90), and even the unrated DVD cut doesn't pile on gross-outs just because it can.  In other words, it's a lighthearted, funny, frequently inspired flick, which on its own makes Anchorman a success by the standards of the past few years.Set in late 1970's San Diego, Anchorman scores some major points with its comedic take on the rapid social changes of the time and the inhernet vacuity of the news anchor's job.  The cast is surprisingly good, led by a brilliantly over-the-top performance from Ferrell (whom I could normally take or leave) in the lead role of Ron Burgundy and the constant scene-stealing of the great Steve Carrell as dim-witted weatherman Brick Tamland.  There are plenty of mock-serious poses to go around, and some hysterical physical comedy led by Ferrell's bizarre turn playing jazz flute (check out those flames!).  Hell, Ron Burgundy's mustache is a great running joke in and of itself.The movie doesn't seem to have many aspirations beyond just being really goofy, but to be fair, it accomplishes that task extremely well most of the time.  Anchorman is at its best in its first half, when it revels in the excesses and political incorrectness of late '70's and pokes fun at them at the same time.  Not to mention, it's a goldline for memorable lines (in fact, Bill Simmons, aka the Sports Guy of [...] fame, used quotes from this movie for this year's NFL preview).  Here's a sampling of some of the classic lines from the first half-hour alone, not counting a few that I can't repeat:""Years later, a doctor will tell me I have an IQ of 48 and I'm what some people call mentally retarded.""""I'm very important...I have many leatherbound books...my apartment smells of mahogany...I'm friends with Merlin Olsen.""""I could be wrong, but I believe diversity's an old, old wooden ship that was used during the Civil War era.""""It is anchor MAN, not anchor LADY, and that's a scientific fact.""""I will smash your face into a car windshield and then take your mother, Dorothy Mantooth, out for a nice seafood dinner and NEVER CALL HER AGAIN!""""You know how to cut to the core of me, Baxter...you're so wise...you're like a miniature Buddha with hair.""""I have very little time to get to the gym, so I have to sculpt my guns at the office.""Unfortunately (even though I sort of saw it coming) Anchorman does lose a bit of steam after the halfway mark, although there are still some great bits of slapstick to be found: Jack Black's dog-punting cameo (an instantly memorable scene if ever there was one); the five-news team brawl, and the knock-down-drag-out fight between Ron and Veronica Corningstone chief among them.  Still, Anchorman manages to generate plenty of laughs and goodwill in its brief running time.  It's certainly not as nuanced and intelligent as, say, Sideways, but then I don't think it's supposed to be.  What it is supposed to be is a nice little piece of goofballery, which it very much winds up being.",3,"Great Odin's Raven, this is funny (3.5 stars)!",1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,3618,"['Anchorman', ""n't"", 'much', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'comedy', 'days', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'enough', 'such', 'comedies', 'should', 'realize', 'definitely', 'good', 'thing', 'not', 'quite', 'classic', 'silly', 'perverse', 'occasionally', 'surreal', 'adult', 'farce', 'effectively', 'same', 'formula', 'made', 'Caddyshack', 'favorite', 'young', 'guys', 'everywhere', 'twisted', 'characters', 'oddball', 'dialogue', 'few', 'lowbrow', 'gags', 'keep', 'everyone', 'loose', 'Even', 'more', 'importantly', ""n't"", 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'wear', 'out', 'welcome', 'having', 'sat', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'theatre', 'can', 'attest', 'mainstream', 'comedies', 'should', ""n't"", 'run', 'past', '100', 'minutes', 'one', 'highly', 'palatable', '90', 'even', 'unrated', 'DVD', 'cut', ""n't"", 'pile', 'gross-outs', 'just', 'can', 'other', 'words', 'lighthearted', 'funny', 'frequently', 'inspired', 'flick', 'own', 'Anchorman', 'success', 'standards', 'past', 'few', 'years.Set', 'late', '1970', 'San', 'Diego', 'Anchorman', 'major', 'points', 'comedic', 'take', 'rapid', 'social', 'changes', 'time', 'inhernet', 'vacuity', 'news', 'anchor', 'job', 'cast', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'led', 'brilliantly', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'Ferrell', 'whom', 'could', 'normally', 'take', 'leave', 'lead', 'role', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'constant', 'scene-stealing', 'great', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'dim-witted', 'weatherman', 'Brick', 'Tamland', 'are', 'plenty', 'mock-serious', 'poses', 'go', 'around', 'hysterical', 'physical', 'comedy', 'led', 'Ferrell', 'bizarre', 'turn', 'playing', 'jazz', 'flute', 'check', 'out', 'flames', 'Hell', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'mustache', 'great', 'running', 'joke', 'itself.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'many', 'aspirations', 'just', 'being', 'really', 'goofy', 'be', 'fair', 'task', 'extremely', 'well', 'most', 'time', 'Anchorman', 'best', 'first', 'half', 'when', 'excesses', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'late', ""'70"", 'fun', 'same', 'time', 'Not', 'mention', 'goldline', 'memorable', 'lines', 'fact', 'Bill', 'Simmons', 'Sports', 'Guy', '[', ']', 'fame', 'used', 'quotes', 'movie', 'year', 'NFL', 'preview', 'Here', 'sampling', 'classic', 'lines', 'first', 'half-hour', 'alone', 'not', 'counting', 'few', 'ca', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'Years', 'later', 'doctor', 'will', 'tell', 'have', 'IQ', '48', ""'m"", 'what', 'people', 'call', 'mentally', 'retarded', ""'m"", 'very', 'important', 'have', 'many', 'leatherbound', 'books', 'apartment', 'smells', 'mahogany', ""'m"", 'friends', 'Merlin', 'Olsen', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'believe', 'diversity', 'old', 'old', 'wooden', 'ship', 'was', 'used', 'Civil', 'War', 'era', 'anchor', 'MAN', 'not', 'anchor', 'LADY', 'scientific', 'fact', 'will', 'smash', 'face', 'car', 'windshield', 'then', 'take', 'mother', 'Dorothy', 'Mantooth', 'nice', 'seafood', 'dinner', 'NEVER', 'CALL', 'HER', 'AGAIN', 'know', 'how', 'cut', 'core', 'Baxter', ""'re"", 'so', 'wise', ""'re"", 'miniature', 'Buddha', 'hair', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'get', 'gym', 'have', 'sculpt', 'guns', 'office', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'sort', 'saw', 'coming', 'Anchorman', 'lose', 'bit', 'steam', 'halfway', 'mark', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'bits', 'slapstick', 'be', 'found', 'Jack', 'Black', 'dog-punting', 'cameo', 'instantly', 'memorable', 'scene', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'five-news', 'team', 'brawl', 'knock-down-drag-out', 'fight', 'Ron', 'Veronica', 'Corningstone', 'chief', 'Still', 'Anchorman', 'generate', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'goodwill', 'brief', 'running', 'time', 'certainly', 'not', 'nuanced', 'intelligent', 'say', 'Sideways', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'supposed', 'be', 'What', 'supposed', 'be', 'nice', 'little', 'piece', 'goofballery', 'very', 'much', 'up', 'being']",Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy

It is what could be only described as a 'marmite' film. Some will adore its comic irreverence, and some will quite frankly 'not get it'. To me personally this is my favourite comedy of all time, and quite possibly my favourite film in general. I will attempt to not use any of the classic quotations from this film as it will spoil the brilliance of hearing them for the first time.The story is set in a sexist news studio in San Diego, America. The lead anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) falls for a woman at a party, and she incredibly, to Ron, rejects his not so subtle advances. The next day that very woman, Veronica Corningstone is appointed as a journalist in their very newsroom. Cue brilliant pick-up attempts, witty one liners, emotional breakdowns and scenes that don't leave the mind for weeks. Brick is the lovable fool, who interrupts with odd - yet hilarious - lines at random parts of the movie, he is the weatherman. The sports commentator Champ Kind, is a more roguish persona, who suffers a mental breakdown after Ron decides to go on a date with Veronica instead of attending their monthly pancake breakfast. Yes it's that irrelevant. Bryan Fantana is the 'man on the scene' and is the typical ladies man. All the acting in this film deserves to be noted, they all convey the different personalities of the charchters superbly and somehow without laughing.All in all I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone with an irrelevant humour or in need of something up-lifting, which this film oddly fulfils.

As such, legendary anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) feels threatened when female reporter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) doesn't back down under his comic machismo.""Anchorman"" is a typical Will Ferrell move through and through.  That is, the humor comes from watching Ferrell recite the most hilarious of lines with the straightest of faces.  Almost every joke is completely ridiculous, but the fact that everyone plays it so straight is where the real humor arises.Also, Steve Carrell (and to a lesser extent other auxiliary cast members David Koechner & Paul Rudd, among others) nearly steals the show playing the ""sidekick"" role.  In one of Carrell's first film roles, he shows that his type of humor (in the same vein of Ferrell) would be around to stay.  ""Brick Tamland"" provides easily some of the most side-splitting material ever put to film.Overall, I consider ""Anchorman"" to be one of the funniest comedy films of all-time for one basic reason: it isn't a complete farce.
