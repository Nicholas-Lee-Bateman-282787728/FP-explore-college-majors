987243,AQ7ZQWXAYT8HZ,B000FBFYVY,"Michael R. Chernick ""statman31147""","[48, 51]","This video contains all the World Series that the Dodgers won since moving to Los Angeles.  This is great for Dodger fans.  As a Yankee fan I was most interested in their two confrontations in 1963 and 1981.  Both were very memorable to me.  The Yankees also played the Dodgers in the 1977 and 1978 World Series but the Dodgers were on the short end of those series, so they are not included.  In 1959 the Dodger won in only their second year in Los Angeles.  They beat Al Lopez's White Sox in 6th games.  This was the beginning of the Koufax and Drysdale Dodgers but the pitching hero was a reliever named Larry Sherry.  Casey Stengel's Yankees only lost the American League pennant twice in the 1950s and both times it was to a team managed by Al Lopez.  First the Cleveland Indians with the pitching of Feller, Wynn and Lemon in 1954 and then to the White Sox in 1959.  In 1954 the Indians amassed an amazing total of more than 110 wins in a 154 game season and so a Yankee team that won as many games as any in the 1950s lost out.  1959 was the only bad year that the Yankees had under Stengel and they finished a distant third that year.In 1963 the Yankees still had Mantle and Maris and Skowron, Howard and Berra.  They were the defending World Champions but got swept by the Dodgers in the series due to phenomenal pitching.  Mantle did hit his 15th World Se3ries home run off Koufax in game 4 to tie a record that Babe Ruth held at the time for most World Series home runs.Three of the games were pitchers battles with Ford battling Koufax twice and Bouton against Drysdale.  But the Dodgers were able to win each game.  A young Al Downing picthed the other game.1981 was another interesting year.  It was a strike year with a split season where there was a playoff in each league between the teams that won each half season.  I think Cincinnati had a better overall record than any team in the National League but because of the peculiar format they didn't even get into the playoff since their record in each half was not the tops in the league.  It was Fernando Valenzuela's rookie season and the popular Mexican was the National League Rookie of the Year and Cy Young award winner. The excitement due in part to the large Mexican-American population in the Los Angeles area led the media to refer to this as Fernando mania. He was able to lead Lasorda's Dodgers to a victory over those Yankees that Tommy's team couldn't achieve in 1977 or 1978.The 1988 Dodgers were the team led by Orel Hershiser and Kirk Gibson.  They beat a strong Oakland As team.  Gibson was unable to play in the Series but in the nonth inning of game 1 the Dodgers had the tying run on base with two outs.  The As had brought their ace reliever Dennis Eckersley into the game.  Lasorda decided to pinch hit with Kirk Gibson.  Gibson hobbled up to the plate and if he hit a long ""extra base"" hit he would be lucky to make it just to first base.Amazingly, Gibson made contact with a fast ball and somehow got the leverage to hit it into the right field seats at Dodger Stadium.Jack Buck was calling the game for the national network on radio and was so stunned that he uttered the famous line ""I don't believe what I just saw!""",4,great stuff for Dodger fans,1213488000,"06 15, 2008",2008,3211,"['video', 'World', 'Series', 'Dodgers', 'won', 'moving', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'great', 'Dodger', 'fans', 'Yankee', 'fan', 'was', 'most', 'interested', 'two', 'confrontations', '1963', '1981', 'were', 'very', 'memorable', 'Yankees', 'also', 'played', 'Dodgers', '1977', '1978', 'World', 'Series', 'Dodgers', 'were', 'short', 'end', 'series', 'are', 'not', 'included', '1959', 'Dodger', 'won', 'only', 'second', 'year', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'beat', 'Al', 'Lopez', 'White', 'Sox', '6th', 'games', 'was', 'beginning', 'Koufax', 'Drysdale', 'Dodgers', 'pitching', 'hero', 'was', 'reliever', 'named', 'Larry', 'Sherry', 'Casey', 'Stengel', 'Yankees', 'only', 'lost', 'American', 'League', 'pennant', 'twice', '1950s', 'times', 'was', 'team', 'managed', 'Al', 'Lopez', 'First', 'Cleveland', 'Indians', 'pitching', 'Feller', 'Wynn', 'Lemon', '1954', 'then', 'White', 'Sox', '1959', '1954', 'Indians', 'amassed', 'amazing', 'total', 'more', '110', 'wins', '154', 'game', 'season', 'so', 'Yankee', 'team', 'won', 'many', 'games', '1950s', 'lost', 'out', '1959', 'was', 'only', 'bad', 'year', 'Yankees', 'had', 'Stengel', 'finished', 'distant', 'third', 'year.In', '1963', 'Yankees', 'still', 'had', 'Mantle', 'Maris', 'Skowron', 'Howard', 'Berra', 'were', 'defending', 'World', 'Champions', 'got', 'swept', 'Dodgers', 'series', 'due', 'phenomenal', 'pitching', 'Mantle', 'did', 'hit', '15th', 'World', 'Se3ries', 'home', 'run', 'off', 'Koufax', 'game', '4', 'tie', 'record', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'held', 'time', 'most', 'World', 'Series', 'home', 'runs.Three', 'games', 'were', 'pitchers', 'battles', 'Ford', 'battling', 'Koufax', 'twice', 'Bouton', 'Drysdale', 'Dodgers', 'were', 'able', 'win', 'game', 'young', 'Al', 'Downing', 'picthed', 'other', 'game.1981', 'was', 'interesting', 'year', 'was', 'strike', 'year', 'split', 'season', 'where', 'was', 'playoff', 'league', 'teams', 'won', 'half', 'season', 'think', 'Cincinnati', 'had', 'better', 'overall', 'record', 'team', 'National', 'League', 'peculiar', 'format', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'playoff', 'record', 'half', 'was', 'not', 'tops', 'league', 'was', 'Fernando', 'Valenzuela', 'rookie', 'season', 'popular', 'Mexican', 'was', 'National', 'League', 'Rookie', 'Year', 'Cy', 'Young', 'award', 'winner', 'excitement', 'due', 'part', 'large', 'Mexican-American', 'population', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'area', 'led', 'media', 'refer', 'Fernando', 'mania', 'was', 'able', 'lead', 'Lasorda', 'Dodgers', 'victory', 'Yankees', 'Tommy', 'team', 'could', ""n't"", 'achieve', '1977', '1978.The', '1988', 'Dodgers', 'were', 'team', 'led', 'Orel', 'Hershiser', 'Kirk', 'Gibson', 'beat', 'strong', 'Oakland', 'As', 'team', 'Gibson', 'was', 'unable', 'play', 'Series', 'nonth', 'inning', 'game', '1', 'Dodgers', 'had', 'tying', 'run', 'base', 'two', 'outs', 'As', 'had', 'brought', 'ace', 'reliever', 'Dennis', 'Eckersley', 'game', 'Lasorda', 'decided', 'pinch', 'hit', 'Kirk', 'Gibson', 'Gibson', 'hobbled', 'up', 'plate', 'hit', 'long', 'extra', 'base', 'hit', 'would', 'be', 'lucky', 'make', 'just', 'first', 'base.Amazingly', 'Gibson', 'made', 'contact', 'fast', 'ball', 'somehow', 'got', 'leverage', 'hit', 'right', 'field', 'seats', 'Dodger', 'Stadium.Jack', 'Buck', 'was', 'calling', 'game', 'national', 'network', 'radio', 'was', 'so', 'stunned', 'uttered', 'famous', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'just', 'saw']","MLB Vintage World Series Films - Los Angeles Dodgers 1959, 1963, 1965, 1981 & 1988"
