251673,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,630141019X,andy8047,"[2, 3]","The now-deceased John Ritter is Zachary Hutton,a bearded writer whose passions are booze and beautiful females. First,Hutton's wife Alexandra(or Alex) returns home from a cancelled flight. She finds a jealous female about to fatally shoot Hutton after she(the jealous female) catches him in bed with his female barber. This is where the Huttons' divorce begins. Hutton goes for advice from his bartender buddy Barney(the late Vincent Gardenia,famous for his role of Frank Lorenzo on &quot;All In The Family&quot;). Angry Alex throws Zachary's typewriter out the window and into the swimming pool. Zachary wanted to remain married to Alex so he sought psychiatric help. He started by cutting down on his drinking and eventually cold turkey,quit. Zach found a new girlfriend Molly(Julianne Phillips) and they lived together. She became so angry with him at one point in the film that she set his piano afire while he was playing it!(Zach plays the piano also) The house and Zach's Mercedes both burned down in that fire. He also meets musclebound Loni Jones(she looks like Patrick Swayze!) at Barney's bar where he was playing the piano. They sleep together that night and when Zach awakes the next morning,he does aerobics in her class in his underwear! Next,there the death of his buddy Leon &quot;Sparky&quot; Sparks. Zach attends his funeral with another buddy Jake(Joel Brooks). Alex was at the funeral and she invited Jake over for dinner at her house. Although Zach wasn't invited,he showed up. So at the dinner Zach and Alex chat and Zach says how awful he's felt since their separation. Zach attends a black tie affair at the Century Plaza hotel dressed as a genie! He thought it was a Halloween party. Many of the guests laughed at him,even Jake. Jake nearly went to the affair as a cowboy! Then Zach finds out that Alex has another man who she plans to marry and almost did until Zach crashed the wedding. Alex's mother Marge always has hated Zach because of his behavior. So more therapy sessions follow,and Zach did more cutting down on his boozing and womanizing. By Christmas,Zach is no longer boozing and womanizing. He wrote a book which sold big and there was a party at Barney's in his honor. He and Alex have reconciled and drank lemon-lime soda instead of gin and tonic. Marge still hates Zach. She was being sarcastic when she said she was proud of Zach. But everyone else who hated him,loved him again. So Alex and Zach are in bed together in the last scene and she persuaded him to get rid of the glow-in-the dark condom which was first seen in an earlier bed escapade. I dedicate this film to the memory of John Ritter who passed away at age 54 on September 11,2003 of a heart disorder.

Shortly afterwards, we all got the shocking news that John Ritter unexpectedly died.  Interesting time to show this film, er ah, I mean ironic.  John Ritter and his work was making a comeback.  On television they were showing, The Waltons, Three's Company and the unforgetable film, The Other (1972) in which John Ritter played the role of ""Rider"".  John Ritter had a new tv series called ""8 Simple Rules..."".  It became a hit.  While rehearsing the fourth episode of the new season, John became ill and collapsed.  Rushed to the hospital.  He died during emergency surgery.  It was his heart.  In artery was leaking blood, a condition that can not be caught in x-rays. A condition John Ritter did not know he had.  The whole nation took pause at the passing of John Ritter on September 11, 2003.  This 1989 film stars John Ritter as a man going through mid-life crisis.  His woman (Denise Crosby, ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"")catches him with another women first in the kitchen and then in the bedroom.  This time she is holding a gun right at him.  He sees a psychiatrist to find out what his problem is.  He loves women too much, but has such bad luck.  THIS MOVIE IS FOR ADULTS ONLY!  There are several scenes with John Ritter is wearing a glow-in-the-dark condom.  These particular scenes and all nudity are cut out of television prints.  This film is brilliantly written and directed by Blake Edwards (husband of Julie Andrews).  It is a comedy (like ""10"" with Dudley Moore and Bo Derek), but it is also serious too.  Some good dramatic acting by John Ritter.  Cast includes Vincent gardenia, Alyson Reed, Joel Brooks, Dee Dee Rescher and Sherl Lee Ralph.  Nice tune by Ivan neville, ""Falling Out Of Love"".  Don Grady (My Three Sons tv series) provided additional music for the movie.",4,John Ritter loves women too much.

251685,ADENS68K21AQM,630141019X,J.Gill,"[0, 0]","MOVIE:Skin Deep, considered by many to be a non-favorite of the Blake Edwards catalog, should warrant some favorable recognition due to the solid performance by it's leading man, John Ritter. His character Zach, is plagued with troubles that can get the best of most men, including women, drinking and self discovery. He then fumbles his way through Blake's story with scant advise from his lawyer and his favorite bartender, played by Vince Gardenia. In an almost 'R' rated version of Jack Tripper, Ritter portays Zach to be a flawed yet likeable character who's downward spiral through the course of the picture has us rooting for a happy ending and some mental resolve.Comedicaly speaking, like most films, there are highs and lows. Skin Deep is not ment to be a Farley Brothers movie or a 'cute/gross' Ben Stiller date flick. It's a bit naughty in spots and even dramaticly satisfying in others. If you like both John Ritter's style of line delivery and his incredibley original physical comedy that he gave us on Three's Company, than you'll find a lot of humor where others might miss it. Remember when Jack Tripper rolled around head over heals while still in sitting 'indian style' on his apartement floor or when he would back down from a bully in that hysterical cowardess fashion that would make the audience crack up every time? Well, there's a bit of that charm here in this picture.Most people talk about the glowing condoms scene, which is quite original and funny, but it takes place in the dark and you only get to see glowing penises bounce around on screen for a few minutes. The real comedic scenes envolve Ritter's facial reactions and physical comedic timing. In one scenerio while in a drunken stuper, Zach leaves a bar with a female body builder and doesn't realize her massive figure until she's towering over him in bed explaining her rigorous work-out routine in detail. When she askes how he feels about being able to then sleep with her, Zach shyly replies &quot;Like Mrs. Arnold Schwarzenegger&quot;.Another scene which has been overlooked in previous reviews of this film is the moment when he tries to leave a day spa after following a beautiful model to it's front doors only to find a bitter ex-girlfriend working there. After a few minutes of shock therapy, ment for muscle relaxation, poor Zach is walking like a man having random seizer attacks all the way back to his car. It's flawless, classic Ritter.ADVICE:If you are a John Ritter fan, see this movie. If you've enjoyed most of the pacing and story telling of Blake Edwards romantic comedies, see this movie. However, If you find that the films of the 80's don't live up to the gross-out fests of todays 'shock-em sock-em' comedies, then think twice.

I am particularly disinterested in most of the popular action or shock humor type of films that dominate the movie landscape of today.I remember the previews of this movie as discussed in newspapers and morning news shows due to the then shocking ""glows in the dark"" scene and that the beloved John Ritter was starring in the lead role.Several years later did I come across this movie and was immediately hooked.The movie is a wonderfully insightful story of a writer whose insecurities overcome his previously displayed writing prowess. The tragedy of writers block is overcompensated by alcohol and sex, which nearly destroys the very endearing character as played brilliantly by John Ritter. The movie is heart-warming yet hillarious. The twists and turns play out in a very well-paced and (mostly) logical format resulting in the climactic (pun intended) collapse of the lead that results in the search of self which ends in a sweet and still funny happy ending.Bravo to John Ritter for a movie that could not have been made with any other actor playing the lead. His combination of sincerity, naivete, sexuality and charm could only be matched by Michael J. Fox, yet such an actor would never have the sex appeal as Mr. Ritter. Anyone seeking an extension of THREES COMPANY would be sorely disappointed (in my opinion) as the acting is vastly more mature and sophisticated than at any time in the popular comedy show. John Ritter seems truly lost in his lack of introspection and his genuine effort to find his meaning of life.Truly a magical movie that deserves far more credit and recognition within the pantheon of great movies.This movie is much deeper than its skin...

251687,AIIR8E34EDKCQ,630141019X,- Kasia S.,"[3, 3]","Slightly dirty, very funny and at times even sensitive, Skin Deep is a perfect film to curl up to on a Sunday evening and laugh well into the night. There's something charming about the late 80's and early 90's comedies that I like, perhaps since it was during my own childhood that they were made but there's something organic to them that many of today's movies lack like the grittiness and the look of the lenses it was shot with versus plastic and computer like movies of today.The humor here is constant; John Ritter portrays a writer who's not only full of himself but also completely addicted to women and alcohol. After his marriage fails (it might have something to do with his many girlfriends) he falls into a slump, he can't write, he cant hold a relationship ( or doesn't want to) and is still obsessed with his ex wife, claiming that she's the only one who can fix him. There's non stop action and jokes, my favorite part was when he followed a foxy looking chick into a spa like retreat only to be subjected to electric shock therapy by an ex, walking out in jitters and at one point tripping on the stairs and grabbing someone's papers spilling them all over the building and then when he ran into a blind man, and couldn't let go of his walking stick, I was laughing so hard that I couldn't breathe, and I cant remember last time that happened to me.  I adored that there was a lot of heart in this, one really rooted for the poor deflated author who skimmed the surface of life with empty things that stopped exciting him after a while, and once the crazy things don't make you tick what is left to do? Trying his best to sober up he takes a new lease on life and wraps the story up with a great ending.

251689,A2NJO6YE954DBH,630141019X,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 4]","""Skin Deep"" is a Blake Edwards black comedy that fails to be dark enough or funny enough to be worth the effort.  The most famous scene, which gave the film its infamous tagline as ""The comedy that glows in the dark,"" is at odds with the rest of the film, which only proves that in the final analysis this is not really a comedy.  John Ritter plays Zach Hudson whose problems with writer's block become next to nothing when his wife comes home to find that his mistress is holding a gun on him because she caught him with her hairdresser.  Zach drinks, but it is clearly more his incessant womanizing that is his biggest problem.  If you think about it realistically Zach is in a desperate straights, but the film does not play out as such.  It sketches his dire circumstances more than anything else.  Zach is really a pathetic figure, but Edwards does not allow the character to play out that way, so there is no lesson to be learned here.  Zach thinks he can joke his way out of any situation, especially if he has enough to drink, but even so he is never that funny or that tragic.There is just something missing here that stops the film from clicking and I do not think the easy answer that this is recycled Blake Edwards holds up in the final analysis.  At face value there should be some funny bits here, especially as Zach makes his way through a gauntlet of women, such as a body builder, that should inspire some comic moments.  But even the glow in the dark scene falls flat because it does not get beyond the simple sight gag (same thing for the dog on the ceiling shot).  The funniest scene is pure physical comedy by Ritter after one his former paramours (Julianne Phillips) puts him through a complimentary herbal wrap and electro stimulation session.  In his heart of hearts Zach still loves his wife, Alex (Alyson Reed), but I get the feeling this is simply because that is what the wandering husbands in Blake Edwards movies do, amply proven by Dudley Moore in both ""10"" and ""Micki & Maude.""  Zach's alcoholism is also just there; not comic enough to be funny and not painful enough to illicit any other response, especially when sobriety is just one gag from God away.  In the end, Edwards tries to have it both ways and only succeeds in canceling everything out so there is really nothing left at the end of this film except a sense of sadness.",3,Niether funny enough nor serious enough to really work,1047340800,"03 11, 2003",2003,2364,"['Skin', 'Deep', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'black', 'comedy', 'be', 'dark', 'enough', 'funny', 'enough', 'be', 'effort', 'most', 'famous', 'scene', 'gave', 'film', 'infamous', 'tagline', 'comedy', 'dark', 'odds', 'rest', 'film', 'only', 'final', 'analysis', 'not', 'really', 'comedy', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Zach', 'Hudson', 'problems', 'writer', 'block', 'become', 'next', 'nothing', 'when', 'wife', 'home', 'find', 'mistress', 'holding', 'gun', 'caught', 'hairdresser', 'Zach', 'drinks', 'clearly', 'more', 'incessant', 'womanizing', 'biggest', 'problem', 'think', 'realistically', 'Zach', 'desperate', 'straights', 'film', 'not', 'play', 'out', 'such', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'Zach', 'really', 'pathetic', 'figure', 'Edwards', 'not', 'allow', 'character', 'play', 'out', 'way', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'here', 'Zach', 'can', 'joke', 'way', 'situation', 'especially', 'enough', 'drink', 'even', 'never', 'funny', 'just', 'something', 'missing', 'here', 'film', 'clicking', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'easy', 'answer', 'recycled', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'up', 'final', 'analysis', 'face', 'value', 'should', 'be', 'funny', 'bits', 'here', 'especially', 'Zach', 'way', 'gauntlet', 'women', 'such', 'body', 'builder', 'should', 'inspire', 'comic', 'moments', 'even', 'glow', 'dark', 'scene', 'flat', 'not', 'get', 'simple', 'sight', 'gag', 'same', 'thing', 'dog', 'ceiling', 'shot', 'funniest', 'scene', 'pure', 'physical', 'comedy', 'Ritter', 'one', 'former', 'paramours', 'Julianne', 'Phillips', 'complimentary', 'herbal', 'wrap', 'electro', 'stimulation', 'session', 'heart', 'hearts', 'Zach', 'still', 'wife', 'Alex', 'Alyson', 'Reed', 'get', 'feeling', 'simply', 'what', 'wandering', 'husbands', 'Blake', 'Edwards', 'movies', 'do', 'amply', 'proven', 'Dudley', 'Moore', '10', 'Micki', 'Maude', 'Zach', 'alcoholism', 'also', 'just', 'there', 'not', 'comic', 'enough', 'be', 'funny', 'not', 'painful', 'enough', 'illicit', 'other', 'response', 'especially', 'when', 'sobriety', 'just', 'one', 'gag', 'God', 'away', 'end', 'Edwards', 'have', 'ways', 'only', 'canceling', 'everything', 'out', 'so', 'really', 'nothing', 'left', 'end', 'film', 'sense', 'sadness']",Skin Deep VHS

It's the story of a man who hits rock bottom and redeems himself.  For a goofy comedy, it's pretty poignant.The film is buoyed by amazing supporting performances by Vincent Gardenia as a wise bartender, Joel Brooks as best friend and attorney Jake and Dee Dee Rescher as jakes wife, Bernice.Invariably, people point to the scene &quot;that glows in the dark&quot; as a reason to watch this movie, but I think that famous scene is easilyt the silliest and most forgettable.
