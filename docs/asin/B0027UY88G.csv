As the description states, the extra features on the disc are in PAL format, so may not be playable on some TV set ups, although the main feature is region free.The movie can be viewed in Danish, or German with English subtitles.So on to the movie.Despite growing up in Europe, and having an interest in WWII both historically, and in film, I was somewhat ashamed to admit that I knew virtually nothing about the impact of that conflict on countries like Denmark, it always seemed to be just rolled in to a more overview of the annexing of most of Europe at the time.Flame and Citron (based on true events) is a stark, but visually compelling deep, deep drama that manages to be entertaining and informative at the same time.Don't expect wall to wall action, this is more of a smoldering story that even feels like it plods in places, but the tension and drama feel real, even stifling at times.Thure Lindhardt (Many may remember him as the Swiss Guard who gets locked in the vault with Tom Hanks in Angels and Demons) is outstanding playing the 23 year old, fiery red headed Flammen (Flame). He's idealistic, energetic and driven by his love for ""Mother Country"" to kill the enemy at all costs, but also introspective enough to know he's living on borrowed time, and that the orders he carries out make him at times question his conscience.Mads Mikkelsen (Casino Royale, Clash of the Titans) plays the older Citronen (Citron) , estranged from his wife and child, and so weighed down with the weight of the German occupation, and his resistance dealings, he always seems weary, unkempt, and deeply depressed throughout the movie.Both actors (and indeed the whole cast) are excellent.At a little over 2 hours, some may find it a little to slow and long, but I enjoyed it thoroughly.Although dark in it's depiction of a struggling people under the boot of the Nazi war machine, with local people turning traitors, spies and double agents, betrayal and murder. The film has a personal feel to it. The violence is never stylized or gratuitous, and the strong human story of love and death is well depicted throughout.As a movie going people we need to get over our avoidance of foreign language films, the popular cry of ""I'm not paying to READ a movie"" is small minded and means that movies like this invariably go straight to DVD, or only get limited releases in theaters, and that's a shame.If you like spy thrillers, drama's or have an interest in WWII movies, this is certainly worth a look. 4 stars",4,"Deep, deep drama - Region Free Blu Ray transfer is impressive",1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,2683,"['drab', 'backcloth', 'war', 'torn', 'Denmark', 'German', 'occupation', 'WWII', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'crisp', 'picture', 'rich', 'colors', 'generally', 'very', 'nice', 'Blu-Ray', 'transfer', 'description', 'states', 'extra', 'features', 'disc', 'are', 'PAL', 'format', 'so', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'playable', 'TV', 'set', 'ups', 'main', 'feature', 'region', 'free.The', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'Danish', 'German', 'English', 'subtitles.So', 'movie.Despite', 'growing', 'up', 'Europe', 'having', 'interest', 'WWII', 'historically', 'film', 'was', 'somewhat', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'knew', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'impact', 'conflict', 'countries', 'Denmark', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'just', 'rolled', 'more', 'overview', 'annexing', 'most', 'Europe', 'time.Flame', 'Citron', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'stark', 'visually', 'compelling', 'deep', 'deep', 'drama', 'be', 'entertaining', 'informative', 'same', 'time.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'wall', 'wall', 'action', 'more', 'smoldering', 'story', 'even', 'places', 'tension', 'drama', 'feel', 'real', 'even', 'stifling', 'times.Thure', 'Lindhardt', 'Many', 'may', 'remember', 'Swiss', 'Guard', 'who', 'locked', 'vault', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Angels', 'Demons', 'outstanding', 'playing', '23', 'year', 'old', 'fiery', 'red', 'headed', 'Flammen', 'Flame', 'idealistic', 'energetic', 'driven', 'love', 'Mother', 'Country', 'kill', 'enemy', 'costs', 'also', 'introspective', 'enough', 'know', 'living', 'borrowed', 'time', 'orders', 'out', 'make', 'times', 'question', 'conscience.Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'older', 'Citronen', 'Citron', 'estranged', 'wife', 'child', 'so', 'weighed', 'down', 'weight', 'German', 'occupation', 'resistance', 'dealings', 'always', 'weary', 'unkempt', 'deeply', 'depressed', 'movie.Both', 'actors', 'indeed', 'whole', 'cast', 'are', 'excellent.At', 'little', '2', 'hours', 'may', 'find', 'little', 'slow', 'long', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly.Although', 'dark', 'depiction', 'struggling', 'people', 'boot', 'Nazi', 'war', 'machine', 'local', 'people', 'turning', 'traitors', 'spies', 'double', 'agents', 'betrayal', 'murder', 'film', 'personal', 'feel', 'violence', 'never', 'stylized', 'gratuitous', 'strong', 'human', 'story', 'love', 'death', 'well', 'depicted', 'throughout.As', 'movie', 'going', 'people', 'need', 'get', 'avoidance', 'foreign', 'language', 'films', 'popular', 'cry', ""'m"", 'not', 'paying', 'READ', 'movie', 'small', 'minded', 'movies', 'invariably', 'go', 'straight', 'DVD', 'only', 'get', 'limited', 'releases', 'theaters', 'shame.If', 'spy', 'thrillers', 'drama', 'have', 'interest', 'WWII', 'movies', 'certainly', 'worth', 'look', '4', 'stars']",Flame And Citron

1254461,A27QKI9K6RKFIT,B0027UY88G,"CARLOS ROMERO ""&#34;natural cinephile&#34;""","[0, 1]","This was an excellent film through and through! ""Flammen & Citronen"" (""Flame and Citron"") from 2008 and directed by Ole Christian Madsen, was set in Nazi-occupied Denmark between, April 1940 - October 1944. It tells the story (based on actual events), of two legendary Danish resistance fighters: 'Flammen' (Thure Lindhart) and 'Citronen' (Mads Mikkelsen from ""After the Wedding""), who were no longer certain of the point and purpose of their mission. This film was very honest in its depiction of the brutality of war, but without the glorification of the actions of one side versus the other side. Here the brutality is depicted by both sides (that's unbiased honesty), and it showed us that the so-called enemy wasn't so easy to discern (sometimes they came from your side), like many of the Hollywood-war films would like you to believe! Here loyalties were questioned and tested, as to who can really be trusted during chaotic times like these (even love was tainted). I give the director a lot of credit for having the courage to show, that even the head of the Gestapo in Denmark 'Hoffmann' (Christian Berkel), (one of the characters called him the greatest mass murderer in Denmark), was not a stereotypical embodiment of evil (he actually respected his adversaries, especially 'Flammen'). All in all, this was an excellent film depicting war for what it really is, a hoax and a crime! There are no heroes and winners when humankind is stripped of all humanity for the sake of national pride, or any ideology that condones war and murder!! The entire cast in the film were absolutely fantastic. This is once again proof, that only non-Americans (I have yet to see a film made here to make me think otherwise, with the exception of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece ""Apocalypse Now"" 1979 and Brian de Palma's recent ""Redacted"" 2007), can make films approaching a discourse that's closer to the truth of the matter.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","FLAME AND CITRON (made for Danish television, originally FLAMMEN OG CITRONEN, in Danish and German, with English subtitles, 2008, 129 minutes) is about two crazy Danes, baby!! Based on their true story, young BENT/Flammen/Flame (Thure Lindhardt) and slightly older JRGEN/Citronen/Citron (Mads Mikkelsen) run about shooting NAZIs. They are superheroes of the Danish resistance. I read about these boys in my local newspaper when I found out that a descendant of one of them lives here.Since this has never been and never will be my area of expertise, let me just observe that this is one heck of a film, quality and drama like few films I've seen. Reminiscent of the venerableArmy of Shadows (The Criterion Collection)(vid. my review), this unusually paced movie brought some thrills that I never thought imaginable. Mostly they did it with incredible camera movement that jars and bounces the viewer to-and-fro in an emotional rollercoaster.Young Flame was the cutie with flaming red hair; Citron (a type of lemon, my dears) looks like a far more handsome, albeit greasy, perpetually sweating Peter Lorre. When they discover that they may have been assassinating innocent people on the orders of their villainous scumbag superior, Winther (Peter Mygind), they realize there IS no reservation for them to leave. They decide to pick and choose their targets from that moment onward.One in particular they want is the Gestapo head in Denmark, Hoffman (Christian Berkel) - the only man who actually seems to respect and admire them. As history apparently tells us, the boys are finally done in when Flame's lover Ketty (Stine Stengade) betrays them. The exciting, heartwrenching and fatalist story of the two heroes is unforgettable. It is just the thing I love: hearing about people who really lived but got unjustly canned by posterity.The color is gorgeous, the locations (Berlin and Copenhagen) are stunning (with some very special effects help) and the cinematography might just start a new fashion - but I haven't seen it properly done except here. The acting is simply splendid: I defy you not to fall in love with either of these necessarily unsavory men. The story is sad and as far as I can determine quite accurate. The two heroes meet an unfortunate but totally expected end.Flame was supposed to run off with Ketty to Stockholm, once he'd assassinated Hoffman; Citron was left by his wife and the only thing he asked was that her paramour be good to them. I guess the theme here is if you're a spy, be ready to surrender family, loved ones, everything. If not, they will do it for you.You cannot miss this, whether you are a fan of WWII films, resistance films, spy films, Danish films or just can't stay away from Mikkelsen movies.",5,"One superhero loused up a dye job, the other sabotaged Citroens",1319500800,"10 25, 2011",2011,2741,"['FLAME', 'AND', 'CITRON', 'made', 'Danish', 'television', 'originally', 'FLAMMEN', 'OG', 'CITRONEN', 'Danish', 'German', 'English', 'subtitles', '2008', '129', 'minutes', 'two', 'crazy', 'Danes', 'baby', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'young', 'BENT/Flammen/Flame', 'Thure', 'Lindhardt', 'slightly', 'older', 'JRGEN/Citronen/Citron', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'run', 'shooting', 'NAZIs', 'are', 'superheroes', 'Danish', 'resistance', 'read', 'boys', 'local', 'newspaper', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'descendant', 'one', 'here.Since', 'never', 'been', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'area', 'expertise', 'let', 'just', 'observe', 'one', 'heck', 'film', 'quality', 'drama', 'few', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Reminiscent', 'venerableArmy', 'Shadows', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'vid', 'review', 'unusually', 'paced', 'movie', 'brought', 'thrills', 'never', 'thought', 'imaginable', 'Mostly', 'did', 'incredible', 'camera', 'movement', 'jars', 'viewer', 'to-and-fro', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster.Young', 'Flame', 'was', 'cutie', 'flaming', 'red', 'hair', 'Citron', 'type', 'lemon', 'dears', 'far', 'more', 'handsome', 'albeit', 'greasy', 'perpetually', 'sweating', 'Peter', 'Lorre', 'When', 'discover', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'assassinating', 'innocent', 'people', 'orders', 'villainous', 'scumbag', 'superior', 'Winther', 'Peter', 'Mygind', 'realize', 'reservation', 'leave', 'decide', 'pick', 'choose', 'targets', 'moment', 'onward.One', 'particular', 'want', 'Gestapo', 'head', 'Denmark', 'Hoffman', 'Christian', 'Berkel', 'only', 'man', 'who', 'actually', 'respect', 'admire', 'history', 'apparently', 'boys', 'are', 'finally', 'done', 'when', 'Flame', 'lover', 'Ketty', 'Stine', 'Stengade', 'exciting', 'heartwrenching', 'fatalist', 'story', 'two', 'heroes', 'unforgettable', 'just', 'thing', 'love', 'hearing', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'lived', 'got', 'unjustly', 'canned', 'posterity.The', 'color', 'gorgeous', 'locations', 'Berlin', 'Copenhagen', 'are', 'stunning', 'very', 'special', 'effects', 'help', 'cinematography', 'might', 'just', 'start', 'new', 'fashion', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'properly', 'done', 'here', 'acting', 'simply', 'splendid', 'defy', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'necessarily', 'unsavory', 'men', 'story', 'sad', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'determine', 'quite', 'accurate', 'two', 'heroes', 'meet', 'unfortunate', 'totally', 'expected', 'end.Flame', 'was', 'supposed', 'run', 'off', 'Ketty', 'Stockholm', 'once', ""'d"", 'assassinated', 'Hoffman', 'Citron', 'was', 'left', 'wife', 'only', 'thing', 'asked', 'was', 'paramour', 'be', 'good', 'guess', 'theme', 'here', ""'re"", 'spy', 'be', 'ready', 'surrender', 'family', 'loved', 'ones', 'everything', 'not', 'will', 'do', 'you.You', 'can', 'not', 'miss', 'are', 'fan', 'WWII', 'films', 'resistance', 'films', 'spy', 'films', 'Danish', 'films', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'away', 'Mikkelsen', 'movies']",Flame And Citron

Written (with Lars Andersen) and directed by Ole Christian Madsen it unfolds a true story about two 'heroes' of the Holger Danske resistance moment, a large group of Danish citizens who fought to kill not only the Nazi invaders but also the Danish supporters of Hitler's movement: the heroes are Flame (Thure Lindhardt) and Citron (Mads Mikkelsen) and the course of their lives is traced with brilliant use of sound, cinematography, a pervading darkness which serves the story well, and attention to minute details that makes the viewer almost involuntarily involved with their mission, their plight and the final results of their work.In addition to the outstanding performances of Lindhardt and Mikkelsen, there are excellent performances by Christian Berkel as Hoffman, leader of the Gestapo, Stine Stengade as the puzzling spy/counterspy/ love interest Ketty Selmer, and a cast of bit players that remain in mind's eye long after the film is over.  Though produced as an epic (and the film is a very very long 130 minutes!) the interaction between the lead characters is clearly defined and they come across as credible resistance fighters whose plight is always one of duress and fear.As in all stories about war that are honest, there is no clear line between right and wrong, between survival and heroism, and it is to Madsen's credit that he keeps us in the shadows with every encounter.

It is lovely to look at, with the gorgeous Danish countryside and majestic city of Copenhagen as settings. It is effective, capturing very clearly what the world must have been like at this time. It is compelling. We sweat and worry and shout and cringe with the lovingly portrayed characters. Those are all good things. They make an entertaining film. But it is more than that as well.There are movies that try to do very little, ""exploring"" or ""suggesting"" or other mealy-mouthed words demonstrating that there is no real theme to them. When a movie ""explores"" the theme of love, I know that people will be in love, but that no particular idea beyond a platitude or two will be discussed. But this movie does an amazing job demonstrating a very easy to state but challenging to convey theme. War is confusing. It is hard to know who is on your side. People lie to their advantage, and when their lives are at stake, they can lie quite convincingly. When nearly everyone is lying, and with a lot to lose, it is challenging to separate the deceitful from the honest. How does one decide who is who? Yet guessing wrong makes you complicit with evil, or dead, or both.Flame and Citron are two idealists who believe they are acting for good. But things are never what they seem, and by the end of this film you will realize just how beautifully this film makes that clear. I don't know if passivity is the answer, but even when you clearly know what the good is, who is working for it and who is working against it is very difficult to identify.And then, to tell us that movements need heroes, even if they're false ones, and conclude the film with the information that these two men were canonized as heroes, well, the irony is perfect.

1254482,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B0027UY88G,J from NY,"[5, 5]","Ole Christian Madsen's ""Flame and Citron"" equals, to my mind, Melville's mind numbingly powerful ""Army of Shadows""--something I had not honestly anticipated.Flame (Bent Faurschou-Hviid) and Citron (Jrgen Haagen Schmith) were the action heroes of Denmark's Resistance to the Nazi Regime and having read about the two of them it is not too hard to understand why.  Infamous for doing what most were both reluctant and terrified to do (actually shooting German soldiers and members of the SS in the street), it seems that it is less the effectiveness of the two men than their bravado and sheer physical courage which is so venerated.  Though in the movie it is haphazardly implied that each had a plan for escape, these plans could have only been very vague. People were tortured and hung for a fraction of what they did and they managed to pull it off for two years. Both were killed in precisely the ways the film depicts in 1944. None other than President Harry Hiroshima Truman presented Flame with a very posthumous Medal of Freedom in 1951.These two heroic and also terrifying individuals are played brilliantly by Thure Lindhardt (Flame, looking every bit Dostoevsky's Raskolnikvov) and Mads Mikkelsen (Citron, the actor's performance as this man tortured by his responsibilities to his family and his unwavering commitment to the Resistance is so powerful as to be frightening at times) are caught in a wretched web of lies and deception no more romantic than a Gothic novelist's version of Fabio going mad.While we are given very little insight in the past of these two, it is obvious that Citron has something to prove about his manhood (the scene in which he tries to reconcile himself with his wife goes to show exactly how the impulse toward violence, however nobly conceived, indelibly stains the human psyche) and that Flame has paternal issues which often disable him from executing authoritative members of the Gestapo who see his youthful weakness and exploit it.The irony is that their superiors talk about ""liquidation"" in precisely the same terms the Third Reich talked about ""liquidation"" in terms of massacring Jews.  Madsen's obvious point is driven home with ruthless clarity: at what point does the righteous revolutionary become as bad as the tyrants they rabidly pursue?  Why did these two take little interest in sabotage, perhaps hiding Jews or saving them? The answer may be that since they had no foreknowledge of the Allies winning the war they saw what they were doing as the only possible means: getting rid of the German army and all collaborators one by one before they take over the world?  That is far too simple, and the answer is infinitely more complex and ominous.That old edict, ""violence begets violence"", is in the end a truth they learn far too late.  The twist in the film which reveals that they have been badly misguided as to who they have been assassinating and leaves nothing for them but horrendous guilt and yet a determination to act on their own.  It seemed pretty obvious to me who was betraying them from the moment the person was introduced into the film, but Flame probably figured he wanted to live as a normal man and not just an assassin at least in one area of his life.  Whatever one's quabbles about their methods, one cannot help but admire the way they go out, just as they lived.  A movie which is a meditation on conscience in a time where right and wrong were discarded like cheap deck of Uno cards.

As other reviews have noted, the characters are not without flaws, and dutifully employed by the actors; Flame particularly crackling, brooding, intense, with the increasingly popular Mads Mikkelsen as his supporting, conflicted, disaffected partner. Key moments in the film are punctuated with dramatic camerawork and snappy timing in the edits; time was clearly spent refining the film, not exhibiting any of the rush-job Hollywood-ism happening stateside. The conflict in Denmark is well-lit here, depicting the split in Nazi reception and the double-agency of taking sides. The history is delivered in a rich, exciting package, with characters which are complex and sympathetic. My only blip if I had to take issue with something, was some truly unbelievable plot concoctions in the later portion of the film.

1254486,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0027UY88G,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I really had no preconceived notions going into the Danish film ""Flame and Citron."" Aside from my knowledge of co-star Mads Mikkelson (frequently seen in U.S. productions, but perhaps most famous stateside for playing the Bond villain in ""Casino Royale"") and a moderate awareness of the plot, I was a pretty blank slate. Any time you endeavor to produce a fact based epic, there will always be detractors claiming historical inaccuracies. It happens to the best, most well-regarded pictures as narrative films are not documentaries. So I make no claims to the precise balance of historical content versus dramatic license in this biopic based on Danish resistance fighters circa World War Two. I don't know enough to make such a claim valid. I will simply say that from a movie entertainment standpoint, ""Flame and Citron"" is a thoroughly fascinating, exciting, and riveting drama--one of the best films to catch me unawares in quite some time!In Nazi occupied Denmark, there is a small cell of resistance fighters aligned with Allied forces. Perhaps the most notorious pairing are code-named ""Flame"" (Thure Lindhardt) and ""Citron"" (Mikkelson). Instructed and given assignments by their supervisor Winther, the two target only Danes who are collaborating with the Nazis. Lindhardt is the muscle and the more impassioned assassin while Mikkelson largely works in a supporting role. However, the dynamic of the resistance group starts to change. With a potential traitor in their midst, an enigmatic new love interest for Flame, and a peculiar shift in assignments to target actual Germans--something is amiss. But who to trust and to what purpose? The film becomes an increasingly frenzied game of cat-and-mouse in which it seems no one will emerge unscathed.Both Mikkelson and especially Lindhardt provide absolutely riveting performances. Mikkelson's increasing estrangement from his family is powerfully depicted, but Lindhardt is particularly devastating as he starts to question every principle he once held absolute. The supporting roles are well developed with Stine Stengade (as the romantic foil) and Peter Mygind (as the questionable boss) really standing out as well. The film looks terrific--this is a seriously well constructed piece. The screenplay propels the action with believability and true emotional consequence. By the time ""Flame and Citron"" arrived at its conclusion, I was absolutely mesmerized by the sophistication, smarts, and commitment that went into making this a true epic with historical sweep. Unforgettable leads and a tremendously strong finale make this a personal favorite and a whole-hearted recommendation.

It uses first person narration from Flame to explain who is what and what is going on which is fine too.  The story is based on facts and it has them take down several people but it is all taking place in the last part of their story mainly. When they are used by a bad leader and then go on to anger their leadership in Stockholm.  The movie tries to hard to place todays sense of morality into those times.  People were not torn as much by war. You killed people , they died, if you made mistakes you had to just accept it.  The feeling that the real flame and citron were tormented even if they killed the wrong people is probably wrong too. They probably were not happy about it but it was understood by people of the  past that you had to keep it to yourself when in wartime.  There were at least 64 members of flames and citrons group who died during the struggle. Both men engaged in bombings too. So It's probably right to say that this is loosely based on them because the ending is probably some 21st century fabrication. (betrayals etc)Although their final fate isn't in doubt , this movie isn't probably on the level. I wish that movies wouldn't interject todays moralities and antiwar sentiments onto the past.

Their real names were Bent Faurschou-Hviid and Jorgen Haagen Schmith. The film takes place primarily in Copenhagen 1944, when the duo targeted Danish collaborators and Danish Nazis. Bent was usually the gunman and Jorgen the driver. Bent (Thure Lindhardt) is a 23-year-old educated and affluent idealist who has chosen to live under an assumed identity, in a basement, and kill people for his country. Jorgen (Mads Mikkelsen) is 10 years older, living on alcohol and pills, growing ever more distant from his wife and young daughter.Flame and Citron go about killing people as if it were everyday business, which it has become for them. They pick up their orders from Aksel Winther (Peter Mygind), go shoot people in the head, and go back into hiding until the next hit list is prepared. They're not killing people; they're killing Nazis. At least that's what they tell themselves. But, as tends to happen in nations occupied and divided by war and ideologies, things get muddy. Bent becomes infatuated with the mysterious Mrs. Ketty Selmer (Stine Stengade), who works for Winther, or for someone else, or for herself. And Winther orders the assassinations of some German Abewahr agents, which provokes a bloody retaliation.""Flame and Citron"" is a good-looking period drama. It's compelling and, frankly, violent enough that its 2 hours and 20 minutes don't seem too long. The visuals are conventional, and we've all seen countless World War II dramas set in Europe. But these ideas are a little different. Instead of simply heroic fighters and Nazi oppressors, we see an additional layer of people: Those who, for whatever reason, played both sides. Those who were mercenary. Those who took advantage of wartime circumstances to advance themselves unscrupulously. We see that the Resistance often knew about these people but thought it in the best interest of their cause to use them rather than kill them. Politics makes strange bedfellows, often with unintended consequences.Bent, Jorgen, and their comrades, the men taking outrageous risks and doing appalling things for the cause, are subject to the vicissitudes of their commanders and the delicate politics of occupier and occupied. Mads Mikkelsen underplays Jorgen a bit, I think. But Thure Lindhardt is fascinating to watch as Bent, a brave and intelligent young man who would normally have every opportunity for a comfortable and accomplished life, but who, instead, is a killer living dangerously in a world that is impossible for him to comprehend.

Nevertheless, I found this to be a solid and compelling WW2 drama. As a WW2 ""buff"" I am a bit embarassed to say that I know virtually nothing about the German occupation of Denmark, or that country in general for that matter. This is the true story of the Danish resistance movement, but more specifically the legendary figures of Flame and Citron; two friends who reach the status of underground heroes for their brazen assassinations of German occupiers and Danish collaborators alike. Flame in particular, the soft-spoken, sharp-dressing 23 year-old, manages to become the most hunted man in Denmark. The film is a bit slow and drawn out, but I found it quite suspenseful as the men navigate the treacherous underworld of partisans and Gestapo spies. Friends turn out to be foes, and vice versa, and what spy thriller would be complete without the perfidious seductress who entices our heroic protagonist to his own downfall? The acting and script struck me as most excellent and the cinematography, while simple, was well done also. The brief shots of the Danish countryside were quite lovely, while the majority of the film takes place in the dreary, uniformly gray mass of downtown Copenhagen.

The deep, closer-than-brothers bond between the two men, Citron and Flame, would've been a tremendous challenge for any two actors, and Lindhart and Mikkelson pulled it off beautifully.I use the word 'beautiful' a great deal when describing this film, with reason.I've read many criticisms of this film and it seems to me that many of the critics like to focus on what they perceive as the moral ambiguity pervading the film, its supposed nuanced shades of gray in a genre notorious for its stark and strictly binary Good versus Evil storylines. Sorry, but I don't see the ambiguity others have discerned. Historically, neither Citron nor Flame had any problems whatsoever shooting Nazis and collaborators. Neither would I. And neither, I think, would most moral people with the nerve and the courage to take up that kind of bloody but necessary work. I happen to think the subplot involving the assassination of supposed innocents was made up by the director and the screenwriter since I could find no supporting documentation showing that the two men were deliberately misled on the nature of their targets.Historical discrepancies aside, the two actors portraying Citron and Flame deserve all the accolades they've received for their respective roles. To play Flame, Thure Lindhardt embraced an almost surreal calm, a coolness under pressure that showed without telling why his character was so good at what he did. It grieves me a little in a way that Mads Mikkelson, arguably one of the greatest living actors in any language, has become somewhat typecast as a villain in television and movies. I mean, I'm sure it's good for his career but--based solely the range of his performance in Citron and Flame--Mikkelson could play any character anywhere in anything and do it better than anyone. And then, of course, there's Stine Stengade playing the double/triple agent femme fatale, Ketty Selmer. That character could very easily have devolved into cliched cartoon with a lesser talent, but Stengade brought depth to that role, gave Ketty Selmer a level of complexity that almost made her character sympathetic. Almost.As a last observation, I've fallen in love with the sounds of the Danish language. I've never heard it before, at least not at length, and had no idea that any Germanic language could sound so....I don't know. Melodic maybe?I wish Danes made more movies.

Like Paul Verhoeven's ""Black Book"" (very good film from Holland), the story of ""Flame & Citron"" is told against the background of the occupied European countries during WWII and their people, but the Danish film directed by Ole Christian Madsen relies less on plot twists, though some part of his film looks more like a film noir.""Flame & Citron"" begins with the muffled voiceovers of Flame, obviously angry, and the real-life footage of German soldiers.

Both believe in their cause until a series of events happens, which will make them suspect that they actually didn't understand the whole situation about their activities, political or otherwise.Reportedly the most expensive film made in Denmark, ""Flame & Citron"" offers several action scenes involving gun shooting and explosions, and they are all competently done, but the 130 minute film's true focus is the two main characters Flame and Citron and the tormented psyches as the fighters who start to doubt their activities. Thanks to the superb acting from the cast, and the beautiful, grey-hued photography, ""Flame & Citron"" remains gripping throughout, though it must be admitted that some plot devices (fictional, I believe) look clich&eacute;d, such as the protagonist's estranged wife and Ketty (Stine Stengade) a femme fatale-like figure playing a key role in the second half.Flawed and overlong, ""Flame & Citron"" is still an absorbing and intense war drama and action.",4,"(3.5 STARS) ""Flammen & Citronen"": Intense and Absorbing Drama",1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,1970,"['2008', 'Danish', 'drama', 'Flame', 'Citron', 'Flammen', 'Citronen', 'centers', 'two', 'real-life', 'resistance', 'fighters', 'Nazi-occupied', 'Denmark', 'Bent', 'Faurschou-Hviid', 'codenamed', 'Flame', 'Thure', 'Lindhardt', 'Jrgen', 'Haagen', 'Schmith', 'Citron', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'Black', 'Book', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'Holland', 'story', 'Flame', 'Citron', 'told', 'background', 'occupied', 'European', 'countries', 'WWII', 'people', 'Danish', 'film', 'directed', 'Ole', 'Christian', 'Madsen', 'less', 'plot', 'twists', 'part', 'film', 'more', 'film', 'noir', 'Flame', 'Citron', 'muffled', 'voiceovers', 'Flame', 'obviously', 'angry', 'real-life', 'footage', 'German', 'soldiers', 'film', ""n't"", 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'introducing', 'historical', 'facts', 'back', 'stories', 'Flame', 'Citron', 'Instead', 'are', 'introduced', 'ways', 'two', 'fighters', 'carry', 'out', 'assignments', 'namely', 'assassinations', 'directly', 'given', 'superior', 'Aksel', 'Winther', 'Peter', 'Mygind', 'believe', 'cause', 'series', 'events', 'happens', 'will', 'make', 'suspect', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'whole', 'situation', 'activities', 'political', 'otherwise.Reportedly', 'most', 'expensive', 'film', 'made', 'Denmark', 'Flame', 'Citron', 'several', 'action', 'scenes', 'involving', 'gun', 'shooting', 'explosions', 'are', 'competently', 'done', '130', 'minute', 'film', 'true', 'focus', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Flame', 'Citron', 'tormented', 'psyches', 'fighters', 'who', 'start', 'doubt', 'activities', 'Thanks', 'superb', 'acting', 'cast', 'beautiful', 'grey-hued', 'photography', 'Flame', 'Citron', 'gripping', 'must', 'be', 'admitted', 'plot', 'devices', 'fictional', 'believe', 'look', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'such', 'protagonist', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Ketty', 'Stine', 'Stengade', 'femme', 'fatale-like', 'figure', 'playing', 'key', 'role', 'second', 'half.Flawed', 'overlong', 'Flame', 'Citron', 'still', 'absorbing', 'intense', 'war', 'drama', 'action']",Flame And Citron

As in all wars, the innocent suffered, both from assassination operations and from German retaliation.  As the group continued to operate, the question arose, and bedeviled especially Citron, whether the leader of the resistance group, allegedly getting instructions from the British, was targeting Danes  who were aware of his business dealings with the enemy.  In addition, someone within the group appeared to be assisting German authorities in exposing group members; the Germans had posted a substantial and ever-increasing reward for Flame, the most notorious of the group.  As might have been anticipated, Flame and Citron came to a bad end.  Perhaps as a consolation, both were posthumously awarded medals.  The traitor apparently received the German bounty for Flame's capture and enjoyed a long and peaceful life after the war.The film was well acted and one got a sense of the humanity of the main characters, motivations and flaws included.  If one is looking for an uplifting film where good triumphs over evil, skip Flame y Citron.  However, if one wants to view aspects of life in an occupied country, it probably hits the mark.

1254516,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0027UY88G,Z Hayes,"[3, 3]","When I heard about this Danish movie, I was intrigued by its premise of resistance activities against the Nazis in WW II Denmark (a country that is also famous for its rescue of most of its Jewish population from the Nazis). Based on true events, ""Flame and Citron"" tells the story of two men, Flame (Thure Lindhardt) and Citron (Mads Mikkelsen who also impressed me inAfter the Wedding)who are part of the Copenhagen Resistance Movement against the Nazis. Their primary mission is to kill Danish collaborators and Nazis, be it man or woman, young or old. Their lives are fraught with risks and danger, and this makes it difficult for them to forge any long-lasting relationships. Flame is drawn to a mysterious woman Ketty (Stine Stengade) who claims to also work for the Resistance as a courier and who seems to know quite a bit about Flame. Citron faces domestic problems as he is unable to commit time nor be there when his family needs him. The film explores the moral ambiguities in Flame and Citron's work - yes, the Nazis are bad and the collaborators should be punished, but is murder justified, especially when one isn't absolutely certain of guilt (in the case of collaborators).The bloody nature of their work takes its toll on both men and Flame has moments when he wonders about the morality of what he does - refusing to kill women, and balking from shooting a target who claims not to be a collaborator. It becomes quite apparent that things are not quite as they seem. The story is fast-paced, and there's plenty of action, but at times it does seem that this focus on action and complicated story arcs (double agents, competition between the different factions within the Resistance, etc) detracts from the actual development of the characters. The two leads are credibly portrayed by Thure Lindhardt (Flame) and Mads Mikkelsen (Citron). The cinematography captures the quiet beauty of the Danish landscape, which makes for a startling contrast to the violence portrayed throughout the movie. I'd recommend this to those who like WW II dramas, especially accounts of resistance movements. Also recommended isArmy of Shadows - Criterion Collection, a 1969 movie which offers a grim portrayal of the French Resistance.",4,The moral ambiguities of resistance fighters in WW II Denmark,1265241600,"02 4, 2010",2010,2234,"['When', 'heard', 'Danish', 'movie', 'was', 'intrigued', 'premise', 'resistance', 'activities', 'Nazis', 'WW', 'II', 'Denmark', 'country', 'also', 'famous', 'rescue', 'most', 'Jewish', 'population', 'Nazis', 'Based', 'true', 'events', 'Flame', 'Citron', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'Flame', 'Thure', 'Lindhardt', 'Citron', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'who', 'also', 'impressed', 'inAfter', 'Wedding', 'who', 'are', 'part', 'Copenhagen', 'Resistance', 'Movement', 'Nazis', 'primary', 'mission', 'kill', 'Danish', 'collaborators', 'Nazis', 'be', 'man', 'woman', 'young', 'old', 'lives', 'are', 'fraught', 'risks', 'danger', 'difficult', 'forge', 'long-lasting', 'relationships', 'Flame', 'drawn', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'Ketty', 'Stine', 'Stengade', 'who', 'also', 'work', 'Resistance', 'courier', 'who', 'know', 'quite', 'bit', 'Flame', 'Citron', 'domestic', 'problems', 'unable', 'commit', 'time', 'be', 'there', 'when', 'family', 'film', 'moral', 'ambiguities', 'Flame', 'Citron', 'work', 'yes', 'Nazis', 'are', 'bad', 'collaborators', 'should', 'be', 'punished', 'murder', 'justified', 'especially', 'when', 'one', ""n't"", 'absolutely', 'certain', 'guilt', 'case', 'collaborators', '.The', 'bloody', 'nature', 'work', 'toll', 'men', 'Flame', 'moments', 'when', 'morality', 'what', 'refusing', 'kill', 'women', 'balking', 'shooting', 'target', 'who', 'not', 'be', 'collaborator', 'quite', 'apparent', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'seem', 'story', 'fast-paced', 'plenty', 'action', 'times', 'seem', 'focus', 'action', 'complicated', 'story', 'arcs', 'double', 'agents', 'competition', 'different', 'factions', 'Resistance', 'etc', 'actual', 'development', 'characters', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'credibly', 'portrayed', 'Thure', 'Lindhardt', 'Flame', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'Citron', 'cinematography', 'quiet', 'beauty', 'Danish', 'landscape', 'startling', 'contrast', 'violence', 'portrayed', 'movie', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'who', 'like', 'WW', 'II', 'dramas', 'especially', 'accounts', 'resistance', 'movements', 'Also', 'recommended', 'isArmy', 'Shadows', 'Criterion', 'Collection', '1969', 'movie', 'grim', 'portrayal', 'French', 'Resistance']",Flame And Citron
