The passion Senna showed in driving and winning showed how he was one of the greatest drivers of his time and not just a good race driver.  Driving to the extreme all the time was like food for Senna.  He did it to live.  Yet near the end of his life you could also see that he did not want to be in his car at his last race.

I had no clue about Formula One, still do not and will never will care about it. Ayrton Senna had just crashed his car and this accident was fatal.Senna was an inspiration and certainly one of the most influential racing driver of all time. This documentary follows his early-years, his success, his rivalry with Alain Prost and reaches the moving climax at Imola. The funeral in Brazil had me teary eyed. It is rare that a documentary can move you so much, especially if you had no knowledge of the subject matter. Truly a serendipitous find. Senna is a terrific film, which will no doubt move you.

1408750,AZR2AL8T2R3BN,B004HNTER6,Amory Ross,"[4, 4]","Senna was more than a man. He was the last of a group of race car drivers who raced in its purest sense. This movie tells the Formula One career of a driver in a way only Ayrton Senna could be attempted to be encapsulated: Through those that were there.Coming up through the ranks of a gokart racer, Senna made it quite clear that he set his sights for Formula One. He broke into a brotherhood that seemed to be weary of outsiders (those from outside of Europe). Senna called ranking officals out in public on their handlings of situations. One can only hope that Senna made Formula One a better sport because of his presence.He was a purist driver. He believed in racing like this because of his gokart background which he stated was about as racing as it could get. Gokarting had no politics, no electronics, nothing but pure racing. He pulled that approach into Formula One and stood out immediately. He showed the world how to race the most advanced cars in the rain. Because of his purist approach, he rubbed many people the wrong way.Sometimes Senna was conflicted. His legendary battles with one-time teammate and rival Alain Prost exposed a personality that perhaps Senna would regret. He dabbled in the affairs of European racers and struggled with impure approach to racing. His call for purity included the safety for drivers. He was the voice of drivers who seemingly were afraid to speak up to the directors of FIA. Senna was more than happy to express his displeasure.It is interesting to note that as Formula One was ushering in an electronic age, Senna would lose his life in a car provided by a team that began the new age. It was in the Williams at Imola (a weekend that in retrospect could have been warning the world) on lap six that Senna left the world. One can only feel a sense of loss watching the weekend at Imola as well as the on-board camera as we, the viewer, ride along with Ayrton on that fateful lap with Schumacher following on his wing.He raced at the end of an inspirational era. Race cars were no longer ground-breaking. They were only being corralled. Instead of innovation, cars were only being limited. As stated before, hopefully Senna's existance in FIA brought about some change. Formula One has not (to date) had a fatality since. One can only hope that it was Senna's sacrifice that prevented many other deaths in the spirit of motor sports. Whether you agree with motor sports or not, this film is a fantastic view into a man who only wanted the playing field to be fair in a time when it was the farthest from. To hear the constant comments from Brazilians who repeated, ""He is the only good thing in our country"" showed that Senna was more than a man, more than a driver, more than a three-time World Champion - he was a god dabbling among mere mortals.One interesting note about Senna's death: Under Italian law, any time a driver is pronounced dead on a race track, the race is to be stopped and a full investigation is to be conducted. With this in mind, the Italian authorities stated that Senna was pronounced dead during the helicopter flight to the hospital, thus circumnavigating the law. The interesting part about this is the doctor stated that Senna, ""sighed...as if that was the moment his soul left his body."" It seems as if the doctor knew that Senna was dead at the scene. Even in death Senna earned very little respect from European directors in Formula One.",5,The Driver of the People,1354147200,"11 29, 2012",2012,3422,"['Senna', 'was', 'more', 'man', 'was', 'last', 'group', 'race', 'car', 'drivers', 'who', 'raced', 'purest', 'sense', 'movie', 'Formula', 'One', 'career', 'driver', 'way', 'only', 'Ayrton', 'Senna', 'could', 'be', 'attempted', 'be', 'encapsulated', 'were', 'there.Coming', 'up', 'ranks', 'gokart', 'racer', 'Senna', 'made', 'quite', 'clear', 'set', 'sights', 'Formula', 'One', 'broke', 'brotherhood', 'seemed', 'be', 'weary', 'outsiders', 'outside', 'Europe', 'Senna', 'called', 'ranking', 'officals', 'out', 'public', 'handlings', 'situations', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Senna', 'made', 'Formula', 'One', 'better', 'sport', 'presence.He', 'was', 'purist', 'driver', 'believed', 'racing', 'gokart', 'background', 'stated', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'racing', 'could', 'get', 'Gokarting', 'had', 'politics', 'electronics', 'nothing', 'pure', 'racing', 'pulled', 'approach', 'Formula', 'One', 'stood', 'out', 'immediately', 'showed', 'world', 'how', 'race', 'most', 'advanced', 'cars', 'rain', 'purist', 'approach', 'rubbed', 'many', 'people', 'wrong', 'way.Sometimes', 'Senna', 'was', 'conflicted', 'legendary', 'battles', 'one-time', 'teammate', 'rival', 'Alain', 'Prost', 'exposed', 'personality', 'perhaps', 'Senna', 'would', 'regret', 'dabbled', 'affairs', 'European', 'racers', 'struggled', 'impure', 'approach', 'racing', 'call', 'purity', 'included', 'safety', 'drivers', 'was', 'voice', 'drivers', 'who', 'seemingly', 'were', 'afraid', 'speak', 'up', 'directors', 'FIA', 'Senna', 'was', 'more', 'happy', 'express', 'displeasure.It', 'interesting', 'note', 'Formula', 'One', 'was', 'ushering', 'electronic', 'age', 'Senna', 'would', 'lose', 'life', 'car', 'provided', 'team', 'began', 'new', 'age', 'was', 'Williams', 'Imola', 'weekend', 'retrospect', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'warning', 'world', 'lap', 'six', 'Senna', 'left', 'world', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'feel', 'sense', 'loss', 'watching', 'weekend', 'Imola', 'as', 'well', 'on-board', 'camera', 'viewer', 'ride', 'Ayrton', 'fateful', 'lap', 'Schumacher', 'following', 'wing.He', 'raced', 'end', 'inspirational', 'era', 'Race', 'cars', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'ground-breaking', 'were', 'only', 'being', 'corralled', 'Instead', 'innovation', 'cars', 'were', 'only', 'being', 'limited', 'stated', 'hopefully', 'Senna', 'existance', 'FIA', 'brought', 'about', 'change', 'Formula', 'One', 'not', 'date', 'had', 'fatality', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'was', 'Senna', 'sacrifice', 'prevented', 'many', 'other', 'deaths', 'spirit', 'motor', 'sports', 'agree', 'motor', 'sports', 'not', 'film', 'fantastic', 'view', 'man', 'who', 'only', 'wanted', 'playing', 'field', 'be', 'fair', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'farthest', 'hear', 'constant', 'comments', 'Brazilians', 'who', 'repeated', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'country', 'showed', 'Senna', 'was', 'more', 'man', 'more', 'driver', 'more', 'three-time', 'World', 'Champion', 'was', 'god', 'dabbling', 'mere', 'mortals.One', 'interesting', 'note', 'Senna', 'death', 'Italian', 'law', 'time', 'driver', 'pronounced', 'dead', 'race', 'track', 'race', 'be', 'stopped', 'full', 'investigation', 'be', 'conducted', 'mind', 'Italian', 'authorities', 'stated', 'Senna', 'was', 'pronounced', 'dead', 'helicopter', 'flight', 'hospital', 'thus', 'circumnavigating', 'law', 'interesting', 'part', 'doctor', 'stated', 'Senna', 'sighed', 'was', 'moment', 'soul', 'left', 'body', 'doctor', 'knew', 'Senna', 'was', 'dead', 'scene', 'Even', 'death', 'Senna', 'earned', 'very', 'little', 'respect', 'European', 'directors', 'Formula', 'One']",N/A

1408755,A391RY3TA1MCVM,B004HNTER6,David Ljunggren,"[42, 44]","I don't particularly like Formula One yet was gripped by this documentary which is just as much about probing the psychology of Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna as it is about his championship winning drives. The family cooperated with the film maker so we see plenty of valuable early home footage of the young go kart driver who gradually works his way up through the racing world and then starts winning races. He slowly became involved in an ever nastier rivalry with the cool professorial Alain Prost of France, who was a very different and much more reserved man. Senna looks more and more stressed as the years go by and despite three championship titles, he changes teams when it appears he has a better chance of winning elsewhere. But the rules change and the car he thought would bring more victories turns out to be highly unpredictable. He is visibly broken up when a young driver is killed during practice for the Italian grand prix in 1994 and yet decides to take part in the race proper the next day.The end of the film is so tense you can barely look at the screen. You know Senna is about to be killed in a crash and it takes a few seconds for it to sink in that you are looking at the video from his car and seeing what he saw. Senna takes bend after bend and accelerates into the straits and you know he will be dead in just a few seconds. Suddenly the car seems to slip out of control and then there is the shuddering impact and the screen goes black. I don't think I breathed much that last minute.

All of the publicity material tells us that Ayrton Senna was a three-time World Champion Formula One race-car driver who died at age 34 (&#34;No fear. No limits. No equal.&#34;). What else can a documentary tell us?Three things stood out for me:1. Senna was from a well-to-do Brazilian family, so his storied career was well documented, from his trophy-winning go-kart days up to and including his death. His pit crew would hand him a Brazilian flag to wave during his victory lap, thus insuring his status as a beloved hero for millions of Brazilians.2. The arc of the relationship between Senna and his arch rival, Frenchman Alain Prost, also a three-time World Champion. These two highly competitive drivers started as rivals but became teammates. What happened after that, was unexpected.3. The problem the professional drivers had with bureaucratic oversight is also well documented. Racing officials arbitrarily removed many of the safety features from those high- performance cars over the drivers' strenuous objections. It took a martyr to prove their point.It is clear why Senna was so popular in Brazil. Not only was he a proud citizen, but he contributed millions to the poor and was a handsome, well-behaved young man. His victories were a source of great pride to his countrymen and his charities insured his reputation as a generous, almost saintly national icon.A Formula One driver has a camera mounted over his right shoulder, so we see the real thing!

No doubt there could have been scores of interviews analysing Senna's talents and being lavish (justifiably) in their praise but that would have spoiled the concept and the flow. Naturally there would be many F1 geeks who would have liked to have seen in depth analysis of engineering, driving style, tactics, preparation of the various cars but in my view they are missing the point of this film. This is not a film about motor racing, it is to do with sporting talent, determination and personal values.I would have liked to have heard more commentary from Murray Walker (who incidentally is the joint best sports commentator of all time, along with Bill McLaren) but I would have thought that Murray's sheer enthusiasm for all that he saw would have changed the calm and atmospheric tone of the film. It was good to hear James Hunt's praise for Senna. Sure, it would have been good to see additional scenes - the race at Donnington being near the top of the list. Perhaps there was not sufficient contemporary material available; that goes for the other scenes that other reviewers have listed. It would have been detrimental to add interviews and talking head pieces to camera to cover the gaps, since that would also have changed the feel of the film. As I said, this is not about F1, so did not need to include absolutely everything.Highlights for me included the scenes from the drivers' briefings and the immediate aftermath of the 1991 Brazil GP. If you're not affected by those post-race scenes then you might as well stop watching the rest of the film. The geeks will have noticed that although the car was stuck in 6th gear, the soundtrack included a gear-change; this film is a work of art so I don't care.It was touching to hear Senna speak of the purity of racing juxtaposed with most of F1 life - but then that's true of life generally probably. As to the build up during the Imola weekend; the selection of the scenes was phenominal. I agree as to the level of detail, it must have been tempting to go on at length as to why Senna was gesticulating at the safety car, the effects of cold tyres and ride-height, and so on.A tremendous film, could only have been improved by at bit less ESPN and a bit more Murray Walker and James Hunt - and a couple of additional races if the footage had been available.",5,Atmospheric,1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,2609,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'TV', 'follower', 'F1', 'many', 'years', 'ever', 'went', 'Brands', 'Hatch', 'see', 'Senna', 'drive', 'Lotus', '80s', 'British', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'hence', 'initial', 'interest', 'film.This', 'gripping', 'film', 'wonderful', 'concept', 'only', 'contemporary', 'footage', 'commnentary', 'doubt', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'scores', 'interviews', 'analysing', 'Senna', 'talents', 'being', 'lavish', 'justifiably', 'praise', 'would', 'have', 'spoiled', 'concept', 'flow', 'Naturally', 'would', 'be', 'many', 'F1', 'geeks', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'depth', 'analysis', 'engineering', 'driving', 'style', 'tactics', 'preparation', 'various', 'cars', 'view', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'film', 'not', 'film', 'motor', 'racing', 'do', 'sporting', 'talent', 'determination', 'personal', 'values.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'heard', 'more', 'commentary', 'Murray', 'Walker', 'who', 'incidentally', 'joint', 'best', 'sports', 'commentator', 'time', 'Bill', 'McLaren', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Murray', 'sheer', 'enthusiasm', 'saw', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'calm', 'atmospheric', 'tone', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'hear', 'James', 'Hunt', 'praise', 'Senna', 'Sure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'see', 'additional', 'scenes', 'race', 'Donnington', 'being', 'top', 'list', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'not', 'sufficient', 'contemporary', 'material', 'available', 'other', 'scenes', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'listed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'detrimental', 'add', 'interviews', 'talking', 'head', 'pieces', 'camera', 'cover', 'gaps', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'changed', 'feel', 'film', 'said', 'not', 'F1', 'so', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'include', 'absolutely', 'everything.Highlights', 'included', 'scenes', 'drivers', 'briefings', 'immediate', 'aftermath', '1991', 'Brazil', 'GP', ""'re"", 'not', 'affected', 'post-race', 'scenes', 'then', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'stop', 'watching', 'rest', 'film', 'geeks', 'will', 'have', 'noticed', 'car', 'was', 'stuck', '6th', 'gear', 'soundtrack', 'included', 'gear-change', 'film', 'work', 'art', 'do', ""n't"", 'care.It', 'was', 'touching', 'hear', 'Senna', 'speak', 'purity', 'racing', 'juxtaposed', 'most', 'F1', 'life', 'then', 'true', 'life', 'generally', 'probably', 'build', 'up', 'Imola', 'weekend', 'selection', 'scenes', 'was', 'phenominal', 'agree', 'level', 'detail', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'tempting', 'go', 'length', 'why', 'Senna', 'was', 'gesticulating', 'safety', 'car', 'effects', 'cold', 'tyres', 'ride-height', 'so', 'on.A', 'tremendous', 'film', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'bit', 'ESPN', 'bit', 'more', 'Murray', 'Walker', 'James', 'Hunt', 'couple', 'additional', 'races', 'footage', 'had', 'been', 'available']",N/A

Although I knew a fair bit about him I didn't reliaze the extent of his good work he untertook for his country and its people. His story on the track and his rivalry with Alain Prost was legend at the time and is pure theatre in retrospect. As someone else notes you get the sense he knew the equipment he was driving was quite likely to cause his death or serious injury - that weekend at Imola was a landmark for F1 and in credit to the sport they took on extensive changes after that race to ensure driver safety became a priority. His was the last death in F1 - 17+ years ago. It was not just Senna death but the extent of other crashs, death and injury at that meeting that changed F1 for the positive.I highly recommend this film, its very well crafted and I am surpised I have not heard more of it. This man won 41 times in 161 starts, he held pole position 65 times and won the world championship 3 times. If you watch F1 try to see this film or at least watch the 1984 Monaco GP - Senna's win still sends chills up my spine - what a racer he was and this films tells us he left a legacy of honour, compassion and a credit to his Country.

1408787,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B004HNTER6,The Guardian,"[4, 4]","This outstanding bio-pic about the life of three-times Formula One World Champion Ayrton Senna is an exemplary textbook study in documentary film-making. Regardless of whether or not you have any interest in motor racing or in Senna himself, this film really is one of the finest-ever examples of the genre you're ever likely to see.All F1 fans know that Senna (full name Ayrton Senna de Silva) died on 1st May 1994 following a fatal crash in the Italian Grand Prix at San Morino, the last driver (to date, August 2012) to die in a F1 racing accident. The film pieces together archive footage tracing early life and go-karting success, obsession with driving and winning and later days of international super-stardom of this most talented and fearless driver. His career-long rivalry with cool-as-ice French driver Alain Prost is revealed in a direct and no-holds barred narrative containing some astounding unguarded, off-the-record moments of interaction between these two individuals of contrasting (and clashing) temperaments.Senna's unique driving talent and personal modesty, the enormous impact his success had on popular sentiment in Brazil, his heartfelt religious convictions and the work and money he dedicated to the education of under-privileged children in his native land are all revealed. On the way we are shown rare peeks into confrontations at F1 pre-race drivers' meetings, and some of the F1 engineering innovations which made their way into mass-production vehicles - like traction control for example.Overall this is a gripping, well-paced film which holds the attention throughout with never a dull moment. The choice to forego a voiceover-narrator and allow the archive film to speak for itself makes the film's impact on the viewer  all the more powerful. Some of the driver's-eye-from-the-car camera-work during F1 races is genuinely edge-of-the-seat terrifying, and allows you to appreciate just what phenomenal speeds were and are involved.If you appreciate good film-making with fine editing, regardless of the subject matter, you really should see this. If you are a student of film or aspiring film-maker then seeing and studying `Senna' - several times, not just once - is a must, and if you're a F1 fan you are gonna love it.Five stars for excellence.",5,Outstanding documentary film-making showcasing the greatest-ever F1 driver,1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,2285,"['outstanding', 'bio-pic', 'life', 'three-times', 'Formula', 'One', 'World', 'Champion', 'Ayrton', 'Senna', 'exemplary', 'textbook', 'study', 'documentary', 'film-making', 'Regardless', 'not', 'have', 'interest', 'motor', 'racing', 'Senna', 'film', 'really', 'one', 'finest-ever', 'examples', 'genre', ""'re"", 'ever', 'likely', 'see.All', 'F1', 'fans', 'know', 'Senna', 'full', 'name', 'Ayrton', 'Senna', 'Silva', 'died', '1st', 'May', '1994', 'following', 'fatal', 'crash', 'Italian', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'San', 'Morino', 'last', 'driver', 'date', 'August', '2012', 'die', 'F1', 'racing', 'accident', 'film', 'together', 'archive', 'footage', 'tracing', 'early', 'life', 'go-karting', 'success', 'obsession', 'driving', 'winning', 'later', 'days', 'international', 'super-stardom', 'most', 'talented', 'fearless', 'driver', 'career-long', 'rivalry', 'cool-as-ice', 'French', 'driver', 'Alain', 'Prost', 'revealed', 'direct', 'no-holds', 'barred', 'narrative', 'containing', 'astounding', 'unguarded', 'off-the-record', 'moments', 'interaction', 'two', 'individuals', 'contrasting', 'clashing', 'temperaments.Senna', 'unique', 'driving', 'talent', 'personal', 'modesty', 'enormous', 'impact', 'success', 'had', 'popular', 'sentiment', 'Brazil', 'heartfelt', 'religious', 'convictions', 'work', 'money', 'dedicated', 'education', 'under-privileged', 'children', 'native', 'land', 'are', 'revealed', 'way', 'are', 'shown', 'rare', 'peeks', 'confrontations', 'F1', 'pre-race', 'drivers', 'meetings', 'F1', 'engineering', 'innovations', 'made', 'way', 'mass-production', 'vehicles', 'traction', 'control', 'example.Overall', 'gripping', 'well-paced', 'film', 'attention', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'choice', 'forego', 'voiceover-narrator', 'allow', 'archive', 'film', 'speak', 'film', 'impact', 'viewer', 'more', 'powerful', ""driver's-eye-from-the-car"", 'camera-work', 'F1', 'races', 'genuinely', 'edge-of-the-seat', 'terrifying', 'appreciate', 'just', 'what', 'phenomenal', 'speeds', 'were', 'are', 'involved.If', 'appreciate', 'good', 'film-making', 'fine', 'editing', 'regardless', 'subject', 'matter', 'really', 'should', 'see', 'are', 'student', 'film', 'aspiring', 'film-maker', 'then', 'seeing', 'studying', 'Senna', 'several', 'times', 'not', 'just', 'once', 'must', ""'re"", 'F1', 'fan', 'are', 'gon', 'love', 'it.Five', 'stars', 'excellence']",N/A
