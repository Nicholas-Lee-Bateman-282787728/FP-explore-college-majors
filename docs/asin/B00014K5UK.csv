792962,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00014K5UK,B. E Jackson,"[3, 4]","I just heard the news that Bernie Mac died.  What horrible news.  He's one of the funniest comedians of the last 10 years.  I used to watch his show the Bernie Mac Show on Fox.  I loved it.  His style of comedy in that show was hilarious.  The way he'd boss his kids around (or rather, his sisters kids) all while having a positive message about how important it is to respect your parents, and how important it is to find important ways for kids to get involved in different activities, and bringing out the best in a family.There was a very realistic and honest feel to the entire show, that many of us can relate to, and Bernie Mac's character fit right in.  I'm glad the show was a success.I remember tuning it to the very first episode, and enjoying it right away.  I knew it was going to be a success, unlike many other Fox shows that seem to get cancelled after 10 episodes or so.  The Bernie Mac Show went on to have a very successful amount of seasons and episodes, something everyone involved with the show should be proud of.Remember the great Bernie Mac by watching his Bernie Mac Show, and experience a comedy that was well worth the time and effort.One of the his most memorable lines in one of his episodes came when he said the difference between new music and old is that, in the older days, you can listen to an album from beginning to end and be completely satisfied with it.  As a music fan, and especially a fan of 70's music, I have to agree with him there.  Thank you for the fantastic, creative, and extremely funny show, Bernie.",5,great comedy,1218240000,"08 9, 2008",2008,1553,"['just', 'heard', 'news', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'died', 'What', 'horrible', 'news', 'one', 'funniest', 'comedians', 'last', '10', 'years', 'used', 'watch', 'show', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Show', 'Fox', 'loved', 'style', 'comedy', 'show', 'was', 'hilarious', 'way', ""'d"", 'boss', 'kids', 'rather', 'sisters', 'kids', 'having', 'positive', 'message', 'how', 'important', 'respect', 'parents', 'how', 'important', 'find', 'important', 'ways', 'kids', 'get', 'involved', 'different', 'activities', 'bringing', 'out', 'best', 'family.There', 'was', 'very', 'realistic', 'honest', 'feel', 'entire', 'show', 'many', 'can', 'relate', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'character', 'fit', 'right', ""'m"", 'glad', 'show', 'was', 'success.I', 'remember', 'tuning', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'enjoying', 'right', 'away', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'success', 'many', 'other', 'Fox', 'shows', 'seem', 'get', 'cancelled', '10', 'episodes', 'so', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Show', 'went', 'have', 'very', 'successful', 'amount', 'seasons', 'episodes', 'something', 'everyone', 'involved', 'show', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'great', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'watching', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Show', 'experience', 'comedy', 'was', 'well', 'time', 'effort.One', 'most', 'memorable', 'lines', 'one', 'episodes', 'came', 'when', 'said', 'difference', 'new', 'music', 'old', 'older', 'days', 'can', 'listen', 'album', 'beginning', 'end', 'be', 'completely', 'satisfied', 'music', 'fan', 'especially', 'fan', '70', 'music', 'have', 'agree', 'there', 'Thank', 'fantastic', 'creative', 'extremely', 'funny', 'show', 'Bernie']",The Bernie Mac Show - Season 1

Each episode shows a loving ""father figure"" who, despite being a little rough around the edges at times, always manages to show his family how much he loves and cares for them.  Every single episode is laugh-out-loud funny!  The chemistry between the cast is amazing, and everything about this show makes you think you are watching a real family in action.

A comedic icon who rose from the poorest of upbringings, Mac blossomed as an actor and comedian. From the stage to television, Bernie Mac first caught national attention while performing on Def Comedy Jam in the early nineties. He later went on to appear in several films such as  Kings of Comedy, Bad Santa, Transformers, Get On The Bus, and others.He was probably best known for his comedy series titled ""The Bernie Mac Show"" which aired for five years on Fox Television. An instant hit with television audiences, the show was based on many of his own experiences as a child growing up in Chicago. The series displays his multiple talents as actor, comedian, writer, and overall performer and unfolds through his eyes as Bernie's character becomes  and evolves into fatherhood.The crossover appeal of the Bernie Mac show further cemented his legacy in the hearts and minds of a new generation. Bernie Mac will be missed as a wondrous talent and his willingness to make us laugh will never be forgotten.

792966,A1KZ93IQ774KR0,B00014K5UK,"D. O'Neill ""Brunt, FCC""","[28, 29]","Perhaps one of FOX's most underrated shows (next to Arrested Development), The Bernie Mac Show is a gem of a comedy series that panders to no one. Using parenting as a background (which comes off more sucessful here than on ABC's My Wife and Kids, but is still a well written comedy), the show goes off in wonderful tangents that make you laugh. The pilot episode started it off with the line ""I'm going to beat them in the heads until the white stuff shows."" Not a line Ward Cleaver or Bill Cosby would've said, but is none the less a brilliant, and uncomfortable truth for many parents. The kids are three dimensional and don't spout sitcom cliches. Camille Winbush's Vanessa is every teenage girl who suddenly finds her world rocked, and hates every minute she spends with her Uncle, while the talented Jeremy Suarez is a perfect foil for Bernie. Even Dee Dee Davis, playing the youngest sibling, Bryana has more dimensions than most of the cast of Three and Half Men. The show is cleverly written and its great to see a ""parent"" on a TV show not know all the answers (which is, of course, the reason why Kellita Smith as Bernie's wife Wanda is there. She knows those kids, and knows their problems and knows, eventually, that Bernie will learn his lessons).Like AD, Bernie Mac is shows what happens when creative freedom is given to a show. FOX may think in demographics, but Bernie Mac is one of those rare shows that crosses over to everyone. And that, I think, confuses them.can't wait for season two on DVD.",5,Watch this show,1124755200,"08 23, 2005",2005,1515,"['Perhaps', 'one', 'FOX', 'most', 'underrated', 'shows', 'next', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Show', 'gem', 'comedy', 'series', 'one', 'Using', 'parenting', 'background', 'more', 'sucessful', 'here', 'ABC', 'My', 'Wife', 'Kids', 'still', 'well', 'written', 'comedy', 'show', 'off', 'wonderful', 'tangents', 'make', 'pilot', 'episode', 'started', 'off', 'line', ""'m"", 'going', 'beat', 'heads', 'white', 'stuff', 'shows', 'Not', 'line', 'Ward', 'Cleaver', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'would', ""'ve"", 'said', 'none', 'less', 'brilliant', 'uncomfortable', 'truth', 'many', 'parents', 'kids', 'are', 'three', 'dimensional', 'do', ""n't"", 'spout', 'sitcom', 'cliches', 'Camille', 'Winbush', 'Vanessa', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'suddenly', 'world', 'rocked', 'hates', 'minute', 'Uncle', 'talented', 'Jeremy', 'Suarez', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Bernie', 'Even', 'Dee', 'Dee', 'Davis', 'playing', 'youngest', 'sibling', 'Bryana', 'more', 'dimensions', 'most', 'cast', 'Three', 'Half', 'Men', 'show', 'cleverly', 'written', 'great', 'see', 'parent', 'TV', 'show', 'not', 'know', 'answers', 'course', 'reason', 'why', 'Kellita', 'Smith', 'Bernie', 'wife', 'Wanda', 'there', 'kids', 'problems', 'knows', 'eventually', 'Bernie', 'will', 'learn', 'lessons', '.Like', 'AD', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'what', 'when', 'creative', 'freedom', 'given', 'show', 'FOX', 'may', 'think', 'demographics', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'one', 'rare', 'shows', 'everyone', 'think', 'confuses', 'them.ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', 'two', 'DVD']",The Bernie Mac Show - Season 1

We love this show and so do our children. This is real T.V. To much junk on T.V. now days. In fact we cut the cord on our cable bill and we no longer have cable. We watch this show through Netflix on our Roku  and our season one collection. We can't wait to see season two!This show is so awesome, you will laugh, roll on the floor laughing, cry laughing.. Whew this is a funny entertaining show! So we like to take our DVD collection in our car so that our children can have something funny to watch, that is clean entertainment!.You will love season one, and will be ready for season two to come out. Not sure what is taking so long, must be music rights etc... but we will be glad when it is released. As there is really nothing on T.V to watch, which is the reason we decided to stop wasting our money on cable. The Bernie Mac show is a show that we already had before we cut cable and we watch the show on a regular along with other great shows like soul food t.v. series, the wire, the boondocks, planet of the apes, etc.. This way we have T.V. the way we want it, and the shows that we like and we can watch the shows over and over, stop where we want to and pick up where we want to..So if still have not decided on this T.V. series, you will be very disappointed if you pass this up. The quality of our first set was great. The art work and disc covers were in almost new condition. We purchased our first set used have just purchased our second set used(will come back and update this review to let you know how the second set looks). First set cost us $8.00 used and the second set cost us about $7 dollars and some change.
