That's how much I wanted this DVD and absolutely loved it.The voice commentary this time is the voices for the twins, Riku and Risa, which is soo funny!We get to hear an unplugged version of the opening song, which just grips and makes you feel the song even more.The four episodes this time are much more developed character wise, and once again staying to some point with the mangas.This is a series that is totaly worth checking out, and a DVD to get!",5,One of the greatest animes,1106784000,"01 27, 2005",2005,537,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'entire', 'DVD', 'extras', 'just', 'got', 'today', 'how', 'much', 'wanted', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'it.The', 'voice', 'commentary', 'time', 'voices', 'twins', 'Riku', 'Risa', 'soo', 'funny', 'get', 'hear', 'unplugged', 'version', 'opening', 'song', 'just', 'grips', 'feel', 'song', 'even', 'more.The', 'four', 'time', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'developed', 'character', 'wise', 'once', 'again', 'staying', 'point', 'mangas.This', 'series', 'totaly', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'DVD', 'get']",N/A
868695,A3K441JYZFY0IF,B0006IIPFI,"Dennis Jiang ""Evilcon-114""","[3, 5]",In this dvd we learn about Daisuke's father and how he met his mother. I just loved how they met because it was just one of those couples that fall in love at first sight. The first episode on the dvd is just humorous and it is just nothing but comedy. The episode just talks about how Risa and Riku switch and take each others parts. Other than that overall I would still recommend watching this series to anyone who likes anime and has patience!,5,D.N.Angel just got more interesting,1115251200,"05 5, 2005",2005,447,"['dvd', 'learn', 'Daisuke', 'father', 'how', 'met', 'mother', 'just', 'loved', 'how', 'met', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'couples', 'fall', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'first', 'episode', 'dvd', 'just', 'humorous', 'just', 'nothing', 'comedy', 'episode', 'just', 'talks', 'how', 'Risa', 'Riku', 'switch', 'take', 'others', 'parts', 'Other', 'overall', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'watching', 'series', 'anyone', 'who', 'anime', 'patience']",N/A

868697,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B0006IIPFI,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","This anime started off a little better than average. These episodes develop the characters a bit more. The relationship between Daisuke and Risa goes nowhere, and the feelings Riku has for Daisuke start to develop. There is also a little bit more detail about Emiko (Daisuke's Mom) and Daisuke's Dad (Kousuke).  It's kinda funny actually. Emiko always insisted before she would agree to date a boy, that they would have a boy. That freaked everyone out as you can imagine. But Daisuke's Dad manned up and stole her heart.These episodes are pretty cute. As with many great shows, it takes time to develop a meaningful story. So my 3 star review of DVD 1, and my 4 star review of DVD 2 may end up being blown away in the later volumes. This series is getting better as I continue to watch. I'll keep watching and let you know how this series turns out.",4,It's gaining more depth,1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,850,"['anime', 'started', 'off', 'little', 'better', 'average', 'episodes', 'develop', 'characters', 'bit', 'more', 'relationship', 'Daisuke', 'Risa', 'nowhere', 'feelings', 'Riku', 'Daisuke', 'start', 'develop', 'also', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'detail', 'Emiko', 'Daisuke', 'Mom', 'Daisuke', 'Dad', 'Kousuke', 'kinda', 'funny', 'actually', 'Emiko', 'always', 'insisted', 'would', 'agree', 'date', 'boy', 'would', 'have', 'boy', 'freaked', 'everyone', 'out', 'can', 'imagine', 'Daisuke', 'Dad', 'manned', 'up', 'stole', 'heart.These', 'episodes', 'are', 'pretty', 'cute', 'many', 'great', 'shows', 'time', 'develop', 'meaningful', 'story', '3', 'star', 'review', 'DVD', '1', '4', 'star', 'review', 'DVD', '2', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'blown', 'away', 'later', 'volumes', 'series', 'getting', 'better', 'continue', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'watching', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'series', 'out']",N/A
