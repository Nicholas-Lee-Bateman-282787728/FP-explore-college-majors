1276123,A1UI21TOBFCY86,B002LC8LEC,"Amazon Customer ""Mona0825""","[8, 13]","As other reviewers state, this is a quite loyal adaptation to the book, but for me at least it deviates in two critical points: the beginning and the end.The series starts with the three brothers playing together merrily. If you remember the book, the three brothers were never together in their childhood! Dimitri actually meets their brothers only at adulthood. And the end: Ivan and Dimitri in a hug while Dimitri is taken away with the prisioner's chain bound to Siberia. Flat out wrong, the end of the book is open, we are not supposed to know if Dimitri really escapes or not, if Ivan recover his health or not and when (though there are hints in the book) and how he reacts at the end. For me, these two points spoiled all the other perfect attachement to the book.At the same time, what makes this book so great is that it's such a powerful reflection on good and evil, on human motivations and so on, but it's also great drama, and I'm sorry but I don't see the drama in this adaptation.And my last quibble: what's wrong with this Ivan? The portray here is of such malign guy that it results even more repugnant than Smerdiakov, this can't be good.Ivan is one of the most complex caracthers in all literature and I feel the actor here just falls short on conveying the deeply troubled psycology of his caracther; a man torned between cold intellect and religious doubt and in top of it in love with this brother's fiancee! Someone that is possing as a cynic ""I know everything and how all of you are mistaken"" dude but at the same time is just a 24 year old young man.Look for instance at the very flawed MGM movie; with all the script problems and clearly looking 44 years old, Richard Basehart is more sucessfull conveying the nuances of Ivan with much less words or screen time.In one word, this is usefull if you have to read the book for school and make a report and you don't want to do so, or usefull if you love this book so much as I do and care about any adaptation made.But a definitive movie/tv adapation? Not for me.",3,"Quite loyal to the book, but ...",1288569600,"11 1, 2010",2010,2038,"['other', 'reviewers', 'state', 'quite', 'loyal', 'adaptation', 'book', 'least', 'two', 'critical', 'points', 'beginning', 'end.The', 'series', 'three', 'brothers', 'playing', 'together', 'merrily', 'remember', 'book', 'three', 'brothers', 'were', 'never', 'together', 'childhood', 'Dimitri', 'actually', 'brothers', 'only', 'adulthood', 'end', 'Ivan', 'Dimitri', 'hug', 'Dimitri', 'taken', 'away', 'prisioner', 'chain', 'bound', 'Siberia', 'Flat', 'wrong', 'end', 'book', 'open', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'know', 'Dimitri', 'really', 'not', 'Ivan', 'recover', 'health', 'not', 'when', 'are', 'hints', 'book', 'how', 'end', 'two', 'points', 'spoiled', 'other', 'perfect', 'attachement', 'book.At', 'same', 'time', 'what', 'book', 'so', 'great', 'such', 'powerful', 'reflection', 'good', 'evil', 'human', 'motivations', 'so', 'also', 'great', 'drama', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'drama', 'adaptation.And', 'last', 'quibble', 'what', 'wrong', 'Ivan', 'portray', 'here', 'such', 'malign', 'guy', 'results', 'even', 'more', 'repugnant', 'Smerdiakov', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'good.Ivan', 'one', 'most', 'complex', 'caracthers', 'literature', 'feel', 'actor', 'here', 'just', 'short', 'conveying', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'psycology', 'caracther', 'man', 'torned', 'cold', 'intellect', 'religious', 'doubt', 'top', 'love', 'brother', 'fiancee', 'Someone', 'possing', 'cynic', 'know', 'everything', 'how', 'are', 'mistaken', 'dude', 'same', 'time', 'just', '24', 'year', 'old', 'young', 'man.Look', 'instance', 'very', 'flawed', 'MGM', 'movie', 'script', 'problems', 'clearly', 'looking', '44', 'years', 'old', 'Richard', 'Basehart', 'more', 'sucessfull', 'conveying', 'nuances', 'Ivan', 'much', 'less', 'words', 'screen', 'time.In', 'one', 'word', 'usefull', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'school', 'make', 'report', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'so', 'usefull', 'love', 'book', 'so', 'much', 'do', 'care', 'adaptation', 'definitive', 'movie/tv', 'adapation', 'Not']",N/A

He was particularly flummoxed by the tavern scene with Grushka and the Poles...of course that chapter in the book was puzzling also. But after Dmitri's arrest, things became much more understandable.As with other CP productions, one gets the impression that, unlike Hollywood, Russians do not want to tamper with their great literature for the sake of film entertainment, and choose to stay as close to the book as possible. That can be a problem (as another reviewer mentioned) with the subtitles which I assume(not knowing Russian)seem literally translated without regard to English idiom.But it is a beautifully acted and filmed production, well worth watching.

1276127,A3PY8CXKKO1Z4H,B002LC8LEC,"Robert A. Klimowski ""martinufan""","[5, 5]","The Brothers Karamazov, Dostoyevsky's most richly philosophical novel, is certainly not a cinema-friendly vehicle for film adaptation. That it was even attempted shows the Russian's great love for their blessedly-troubled literary giant. The treatment here is quite faithful (Mona0825's earlier review points out some important deviations, however), and I was surprised by how many scenes, even those I thought couldn't be filmed, were portrayed. The novel is so sprawling that events and relationships can become ""disjointed"" in your mind. That's why I turned to this video version. It helped me a great deal to keep things straight.A few things bothered me. Sergey Koltakov as the father, Fyodor Karamazov, was simply too attractive. In the book, his physical repulsiveness reflects his sick and depraved personality - you can't help hating his guts. Here, the father certainly invites our contempt, but is too much of a dandified fool to prompt our hatred. As in Crime and Punishment, by eliciting our hatred of a character, Dostoyevsky is very skillfully and deliberately preparing us to feel the same guilt the characters will feel after the murder.Aleksei Rybnikov's score is too romantically lush for my tastes and sometimes intrudes when it shouldn't. Particularly annoying is his ""children's theme"" which attempts to evoke an innocence that is rarely present in the worldly-wise youths of the story. This score harkens back to the golden age of Steiner and Newman. A more brittle and grittier score would, I think, have given the tale more of a modern ""edge.""I found the acting to be excellent all around. I disagree with Mona0825's earlier review which criticizes Anatoliy Belyy's performance as Ivan. What we see here is a character being crushed by his pride. He starts off as arrogant and ends up a beaten, but better, man. I felt real sympathy for him, and watching the film helped me to realize that this story is much more about Ivan than anyone else.Overall, well worth seeing. It can't match the novel, of course, but it may inspire you to dig deeper into one of the rare books that just keeps on giving.",4,A Useful Visualization,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,2122,"['Brothers', 'Karamazov', 'Dostoyevsky', 'most', 'richly', 'philosophical', 'novel', 'certainly', 'not', 'cinema-friendly', 'vehicle', 'film', 'adaptation', 'was', 'even', 'attempted', 'Russian', 'great', 'love', 'blessedly-troubled', 'literary', 'giant', 'treatment', 'here', 'quite', 'faithful', 'Mona0825', 'earlier', 'review', 'points', 'out', 'important', 'deviations', 'however', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'many', 'scenes', 'even', 'thought', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'filmed', 'were', 'portrayed', 'novel', 'so', 'sprawling', 'events', 'relationships', 'can', 'become', 'disjointed', 'mind', 'why', 'turned', 'video', 'version', 'helped', 'great', 'deal', 'keep', 'things', 'straight.A', 'few', 'things', 'bothered', 'Sergey', 'Koltakov', 'father', 'Fyodor', 'Karamazov', 'was', 'simply', 'too', 'attractive', 'book', 'physical', 'repulsiveness', 'sick', 'depraved', 'personality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'hating', 'guts', 'Here', 'father', 'certainly', 'contempt', 'too', 'much', 'dandified', 'fool', 'prompt', 'hatred', 'Crime', 'Punishment', 'eliciting', 'hatred', 'character', 'Dostoyevsky', 'very', 'skillfully', 'deliberately', 'preparing', 'feel', 'same', 'guilt', 'characters', 'will', 'feel', 'murder.Aleksei', 'Rybnikov', 'score', 'too', 'romantically', 'lush', 'tastes', 'sometimes', 'intrudes', 'when', 'should', ""n't"", 'Particularly', 'annoying', 'children', 'theme', 'evoke', 'innocence', 'rarely', 'present', 'worldly-wise', 'youths', 'story', 'score', 'back', 'golden', 'age', 'Steiner', 'Newman', 'A', 'more', 'brittle', 'grittier', 'score', 'would', 'think', 'have', 'given', 'tale', 'more', 'modern', 'edge', 'found', 'acting', 'be', 'excellent', 'disagree', 'Mona0825', 'earlier', 'review', 'Anatoliy', 'Belyy', 'performance', 'Ivan', 'What', 'see', 'here', 'character', 'being', 'crushed', 'pride', 'off', 'arrogant', 'up', 'beaten', 'better', 'man', 'felt', 'real', 'sympathy', 'watching', 'film', 'helped', 'realize', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'Ivan', 'anyone', 'else.Overall', 'well', 'seeing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'match', 'novel', 'course', 'may', 'inspire', 'dig', 'deeper', 'one', 'rare', 'books', 'just', 'giving']",N/A

Bravo!I read Brothers Karamazov (one of the greatest novels ever written) only a year ago, so I was thrilled to have this new Russian-made mini-series now available. This mini-series is quite true to the novel. With twelve episodes running almost nine hours, this is certainly the most accurate dramatization to date. Casting is superb (near perfection). The production value is very high. Sets and settings are amazing (especially the outdoor scenes). What a truly wonderful production.Russian-made productions of classic novels seem to have much greater respect for the original material than American or British productions. For example, the ""Idiot"" mini-series and the ""Master and Margarita"" mini-series are both very true to their respective novels. So it is with this production of Brothers Karamazov.The English subtitles are very good. There are some instances of typographical errors (for example, ""song"" instead of ""son""), and there are a few instances where the translation could have been improved (for example, the translation used ""bride"" instead of ""fiance"" or ""betrothed"").
