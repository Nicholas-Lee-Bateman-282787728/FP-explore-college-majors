Did they know that he was the worst actor of the original, beating out the ineffable Courtney Gains? How the series lasted this long is beyond my belief. Children of the Corny 666: Isaac's Return is another crapfest. If you asked me what the movie was all about, I verily cannot be more clueless. As much I hate John Franklin, the sight of him being a midget puppet is deserving and funny.

This film is set in Gatlin, Nebraska, the same as the first, and the town of Hemingford where events from Part 2 took place gets a mention. And finally the book written by Isaac which was used in &#34;Urban Harvest&#34; is mentioned.As the film opens, we meet Hannah, Rachel's grown daughter from the first film and the first child born of the Gatlin kids. Hannah is on her way back to Gatlin to find her birth mother, but along the way she begin suffering from odd visions and she crashes...into a corn field naturally. Taken to the local hospital in Gatlin, Rachel meets Dr. Miichaels (Stacy Keach) who fills her in on the &#34;true&#34; events which occured in Gatlin. Hannah soon learns that Isaac is still alive, but in a coma.Hannah sneaks off for a quick peek at Isaac only to have him awaken wearing green contact lenses. She soon had visions of him stalking the halls of the hospital in a bathrobe and using a walker to get around!?!? Hannah meets some wacky towns people and every time someone gets near a corn field, kids magically appear, and after a whole lot of not much, Hannah is reunited with her mom, and she soon learns she's part of a prophecy to bring back He Who Walks Behind the Rows and....blah, blah, blah.And as first seen in Part V, &#34;Nebraska&#34;'s mountain range is showcased, they even feature a repeated shot of the sun breaking over the mountain tops?? The only thing worse than California trying to pass for Nebraska was the green contact lenses the give Isaac. No wonder he's mad, he's been in 20-year coma and never took out his contacts...his eyes must be itchy as all get out?Honestly, I think there is a nugget of a good story here. I liked the idea of Isaac coming back, but why they make him so frail and toothless is beyond me? He was a creepy little dude in the first film, and here you worry that he'll break a hip walking through the corn. Once He Who Walks Behind The Rows finally shows up, I'm embarrassed for him. For some reason they decide to give him the personality of a Wacky Morning DJ.Boring, not scary, and just dull. If there were any teeth left in this series they've been pulled and replaced with dentures at this point. I'm really hoping part 7 can give me something more enjoyabel, even if it's a so-bad-it's-good something.",2,He Who Uses a Walker Behind the Rows???,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,2692,"['will', 'give', '34', 'Children', 'Corn', '666', 'Isaac', 'Return', '34', 'credit', 'attempting', 'get', 'series', 'back', 'roots', '34', 'Isaac', 'Return', '34', 'direct', 'sequel', 'original', 'three', 'films', 'series', 'yes', 'John', 'Franklin', 'Isaac', 'back', 'reference', 'Rachel', 'who', 'was', 'seen', 'pregnant', 'first', 'film', 'when', 'lover/husband', 'Amos', 'willing', 'sacrificed', 'Who', 'Walks', 'Rows', 'film', 'set', 'Gatlin', 'Nebraska', 'same', 'first', 'town', 'Hemingford', 'where', 'events', 'Part', '2', 'took', 'place', 'mention', 'finally', 'book', 'written', 'Isaac', 'was', 'used', '34', 'Urban', 'Harvest', '34', 'film', 'meet', 'Hannah', 'Rachel', 'grown', 'daughter', 'first', 'film', 'first', 'child', 'born', 'Gatlin', 'kids', 'Hannah', 'way', 'back', 'Gatlin', 'find', 'birth', 'mother', 'way', 'begin', 'suffering', 'odd', 'visions', 'crashes', 'corn', 'field', 'naturally', 'Taken', 'local', 'hospital', 'Gatlin', 'Rachel', 'Dr.', 'Miichaels', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'who', '34', 'true', '34', 'events', 'occured', 'Gatlin', 'Hannah', 'soon', 'Isaac', 'still', 'alive', 'coma.Hannah', 'off', 'quick', 'peek', 'Isaac', 'only', 'have', 'awaken', 'wearing', 'green', 'contact', 'lenses', 'soon', 'had', 'visions', 'stalking', 'halls', 'hospital', 'bathrobe', 'using', 'walker', 'get', 'Hannah', 'wacky', 'towns', 'people', 'time', 'someone', 'corn', 'field', 'kids', 'magically', 'appear', 'whole', 'lot', 'not', 'much', 'Hannah', 'reunited', 'mom', 'soon', 'part', 'prophecy', 'bring', 'back', 'Who', 'Walks', 'Rows', '.blah', 'blah', 'blah.And', 'first', 'seen', 'Part', 'V', '34', 'Nebraska', '34', 'mountain', 'range', 'showcased', 'even', 'feature', 'repeated', 'shot', 'sun', 'breaking', 'mountain', 'tops', 'only', 'thing', 'worse', 'California', 'trying', 'pass', 'Nebraska', 'was', 'green', 'contact', 'give', 'Isaac', 'wonder', 'mad', 'been', '20-year', 'coma', 'never', 'took', 'out', 'contacts', 'eyes', 'must', 'be', 'itchy', 'get', 'out', 'Honestly', 'think', 'nugget', 'good', 'story', 'here', 'liked', 'idea', 'Isaac', 'coming', 'back', 'why', 'make', 'so', 'frail', 'toothless', 'was', 'creepy', 'little', 'dude', 'first', 'film', 'here', 'worry', ""'ll"", 'break', 'hip', 'walking', 'corn', 'Once', 'Who', 'Walks', 'Rows', 'finally', 'up', ""'m"", 'embarrassed', 'reason', 'decide', 'give', 'personality', 'Wacky', 'Morning', 'DJ.Boring', 'not', 'scary', 'just', 'dull', 'were', 'teeth', 'left', 'series', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pulled', 'replaced', 'dentures', 'point', ""'m"", 'really', 'hoping', 'part', '7', 'can', 'give', 'something', 'more', 'enjoyabel', 'even', ""so-bad-it's-good"", 'something']",Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return VHS
468829,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,6305538085,drkhimxz,"[0, 0]","This is like arriving in the middle of a film and trying to figure out the story. I did not see any of the preceding Corn movies which, presumably, provided the framework within this  episode fits....or maybe not. At any rate, if you are in my position, I would recommend skipping this one until you have seen some of the preceding ones. If you accept the magic  premises, the story is simple enough: girl comes to a small town in the middle of nowhere to find her birth mother. How she knew where to look we do not know. She has some spooky experiences and ends up in a hospital of some sort which seems to be run somewhat along the lines of a 17th century insane asylum (as they were called then). Here we come to the highlight of the film: she meets Stacy Keach, the only performer I know of in the picture. He plays a guy who appears to be the  physician (?) in charge; we quickly learn that he drinks and smokes heavily. Finally, drifting aimlessly through the hospital, she sees a patient who is barely alive; thias is the Isaac of the title, as we later learn. From there it goes downhill, with frightening experiences, meeting young men, staying in a Motel out of Hitchcock, and various other events of which I better not write. At any rate, she is given a hard time........At its best, the film resembles an episode of a creaky television series with a continuing story. It begins and ends up in the air. If you must see everything connected with Stephen King or every episode of the Corn series, then, of course, you will see this regardless of anything anyone says. For the others, I cannot recommend it, but, if you want a short (hour and 25 minutes roughly) movie that will not give you nightmares, but will fill the time, this could do, if the cost is minimal.",2,Film Without a Beginning,1370304000,"06 4, 2013",2013,1774,"['arriving', 'middle', 'film', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'preceding', 'Corn', 'movies', 'presumably', 'provided', 'framework', 'episode', '.or', 'maybe', 'not', 'rate', 'are', 'position', 'would', 'recommend', 'skipping', 'one', 'have', 'seen', 'preceding', 'ones', 'accept', 'magic', 'premises', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'girl', 'small', 'town', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'find', 'birth', 'mother', 'How', 'knew', 'where', 'look', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'spooky', 'experiences', 'up', 'hospital', 'sort', 'be', 'run', 'somewhat', 'lines', '17th', 'century', 'insane', 'asylum', 'were', 'called', 'then', 'Here', 'come', 'highlight', 'film', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'only', 'performer', 'know', 'picture', 'guy', 'who', 'be', 'physician', 'charge', 'quickly', 'learn', 'heavily', 'Finally', 'drifting', 'aimlessly', 'hospital', 'patient', 'who', 'barely', 'alive', 'Isaac', 'title', 'later', 'learn', 'downhill', 'frightening', 'experiences', 'meeting', 'young', 'men', 'staying', 'Motel', 'Hitchcock', 'various', 'other', 'events', 'better', 'not', 'write', 'rate', 'given', 'hard', 'time', 'best', 'film', 'episode', 'creaky', 'television', 'series', 'continuing', 'story', 'up', 'air', 'must', 'see', 'everything', 'connected', 'Stephen', 'King', 'episode', 'Corn', 'series', 'then', 'course', 'will', 'see', 'regardless', 'anything', 'anyone', 'others', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'want', 'short', 'hour', '25', 'minutes', 'roughly', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'nightmares', 'will', 'fill', 'time', 'could', 'do', 'cost', 'minimal']",Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return VHS
468830,A1Q1PP3Z4QDUQM,6305538085,Farffleblex Plaffington,"[2, 2]","This is an unfortunate one.  Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return (CotC6) probably has the best cinematography, best editing, some of the best effects, and some of the creepiest scenes of any CotC film to this point, but the script is a complete mess and helmer Kari Skogland does not seem to be very skilled at directing actors.For at least the first 10-15 minutes of CotC6, I was prepared to give it at least a 4.  Hannah (Natalie Ramsey) is driving to the town of Gatlin, Nebraska--the setting of the first film--and gives a ride to what turns out to be a disturbing ghost.  She soon after wipes out in a cornfield, and a creepy policewoman-- nicely cast against type, takes her to a hospital to be checked out, only it's a hospital that's apparently been taken over by mental patients.  This is all great stuff, well filmed, with refreshing differences from the rest of the series.But then as the dialogue and exposition increase, the film begins to fall apart.  The plot brings back Isaac (John Franklin) from the first film, with Hannah playing a major role in a ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows""-religion prophecy.  That maybe wasn't a bad idea, but the script feels like a first or second draft.  It's choppy and just doesn't make much sense.  The characters are bizarre, as if scripter Tim Sulka and co-writer Franklin kept changing their minds about dispositions every two pages.  Hannah will seem gung-ho about experiencing Gatlin's weirdness one minute, oddly indifferent the next, then desperate to escape, and then gung-ho . . . Isaac vacillates between innocuous and evil.  Rachel's (Nancy Allen) pendulum swings between psychopathic and protective.  Maybe there were two or three completely different approaches tried, but they ran out of money, so the final film was a mash-up?And Skogland doesn't help.  She tends to encourage her cast to overact, she exaggerates the multiple personality feeling, and she makes sure that everything seems pretentiously stagy.",2,Too bad,1194652800,"11 10, 2007",2007,1978,"['unfortunate', 'one', 'Children', 'Corn', '666', 'Isaac', 'Return', 'CotC6', 'probably', 'best', 'cinematography', 'best', 'editing', 'best', 'effects', 'creepiest', 'scenes', 'CotC', 'film', 'point', 'script', 'complete', 'mess', 'helmer', 'Kari', 'Skogland', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'skilled', 'directing', 'actors.For', 'least', 'first', '10-15', 'minutes', 'CotC6', 'was', 'prepared', 'give', 'least', '4', 'Hannah', 'Natalie', 'Ramsey', 'driving', 'town', 'Gatlin', 'Nebraska', 'setting', 'first', 'film', 'ride', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'disturbing', 'ghost', 'soon', 'wipes', 'out', 'cornfield', 'creepy', 'policewoman', 'nicely', 'cast', 'type', 'hospital', 'be', 'checked', 'out', 'only', 'hospital', 'apparently', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'mental', 'patients', 'great', 'stuff', 'well', 'filmed', 'refreshing', 'differences', 'rest', 'series.But', 'then', 'dialogue', 'exposition', 'increase', 'film', 'fall', 'apart', 'plot', 'back', 'Isaac', 'John', 'Franklin', 'first', 'film', 'Hannah', 'playing', 'major', 'role', 'Who', 'Walks', 'Rows', '-religion', 'prophecy', 'maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'idea', 'script', 'feels', 'first', 'second', 'draft', 'choppy', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'characters', 'are', 'bizarre', 'scripter', 'Tim', 'Sulka', 'co-writer', 'Franklin', 'kept', 'changing', 'minds', 'dispositions', 'two', 'pages', 'Hannah', 'will', 'seem', 'gung-ho', 'experiencing', 'Gatlin', 'weirdness', 'one', 'minute', 'oddly', 'indifferent', 'next', 'then', 'desperate', 'escape', 'then', 'gung-ho', 'Isaac', 'innocuous', 'evil', 'Rachel', 'Nancy', 'Allen', 'pendulum', 'swings', 'psychopathic', 'protective', 'Maybe', 'were', 'two', 'three', 'completely', 'different', 'approaches', 'tried', 'ran', 'money', 'final', 'film', 'was', 'mash-up', 'Skogland', ""n't"", 'help', 'encourage', 'cast', 'overact', 'multiple', 'personality', 'feeling', 'sure', 'everything', 'pretentiously', 'stagy']",Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return VHS

That included 8 films and 1 remake and over all I think they were all just your average horror flicks. Some better than others but none were classics. Any way this one is actually the sixth film and the second to feature evil cult leader Isaac. That is the most appealing thing about this, well there is the twist at the end that was kinda cool.Hannah is traveling to Gatlin to find her mother and learn about her history in this town. Turns out she is a child from the original children that plagued Gatlin. On the way there she picks up a man who starts to preach and warn her about things to come. He then disappears and she crashes into a corn field only to be picked up by a police officer who takes her to the town hospital. In town she learns more and more about the town and its strange people and history. These people include a comatose Isaac, the original leader of the cult and a young man who seems to be befriending her.Now for any one that has not seen this I will tell you right now that this one does not feature children running around killing adults. In fact it is the adults who are the killers here since they are the kids all grown up. I will admit that when this film first came out I was excited for it, the idea behind is a good one. Unfortunately it ends up being a average film in a average series for the most part. I did like that Isaac was brought back but that along with so much more does not make sense if you have seen the other films. Then again it is a horror film and a COTC flick at that.Speaking of the returning Isaac the man playing him John Franklin also co wrote the script with Tim Sulka, this is the last thing they have written if I am correct. At least the direction here seemed on point thanks to Kari Skogland who went on to direct much better things including her latest, an episode of ""Boardwalk Empire"". The other thing I liked here was the little twist at the end, I know some who didn't like it but I kinda did.In the end I would say that the film deserves some of the hate it gets but there are some good things to find here. In fact it is a COTC flick so people should have expected some of the cheesy stuff to be honest. Was it a mistake to bring Isaac back, when looking at the other films and wanting to make sense, yes. But being a B horror movie I think for the most part it was ok. My question though is this, why didn't they bring back Malachi? Also I would have loved if this film had a commentary from John, Tim, and Kari or John and Tim at least.",3,ANOTHER AVERAGE COTC FLICK EVEN WITH ISAAC RETURNING,1354492800,"12 3, 2012",2012,2675,"['CHILDREN', 'THE', 'CORN', '666ISSAC', 'RETURNAfter', 'watching', 'first', 'Children', 'Corn', 'past', 'month', 'decided', 'would', 'sit', 'way', 'entire', 'series', 'included', '8', 'films', '1', 'remake', 'think', 'were', 'just', 'average', 'horror', 'flicks', 'better', 'others', 'none', 'were', 'classics', 'way', 'one', 'actually', 'sixth', 'film', 'second', 'feature', 'evil', 'cult', 'leader', 'Isaac', 'most', 'appealing', 'thing', 'well', 'twist', 'end', 'was', 'kinda', 'cool.Hannah', 'traveling', 'Gatlin', 'find', 'mother', 'learn', 'history', 'town', 'out', 'child', 'original', 'children', 'plagued', 'Gatlin', 'way', 'up', 'man', 'who', 'preach', 'warn', 'things', 'come', 'then', 'corn', 'field', 'only', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'town', 'hospital', 'town', 'more', 'more', 'town', 'strange', 'people', 'history', 'people', 'include', 'comatose', 'Isaac', 'original', 'leader', 'cult', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'befriending', 'her.Now', 'one', 'not', 'seen', 'will', 'tell', 'right', 'now', 'one', 'not', 'feature', 'children', 'running', 'around', 'killing', 'adults', 'fact', 'adults', 'who', 'are', 'killers', 'here', 'are', 'kids', 'grown', 'up', 'will', 'admit', 'when', 'film', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'excited', 'idea', 'behind', 'good', 'one', 'up', 'being', 'average', 'film', 'average', 'series', 'most', 'part', 'did', 'Isaac', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'along', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'Then', 'again', 'horror', 'film', 'COTC', 'flick', 'that.Speaking', 'returning', 'Isaac', 'man', 'playing', 'John', 'Franklin', 'also', 'co', 'wrote', 'script', 'Tim', 'Sulka', 'last', 'thing', 'have', 'written', 'am', 'correct', 'least', 'direction', 'here', 'seemed', 'point', 'thanks', 'Kari', 'Skogland', 'who', 'went', 'direct', 'much', 'better', 'things', 'including', 'latest', 'episode', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'other', 'thing', 'liked', 'here', 'was', 'little', 'twist', 'end', 'know', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'kinda', 'did.In', 'end', 'would', 'say', 'film', 'hate', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'find', 'here', 'fact', 'COTC', 'flick', 'so', 'people', 'should', 'have', 'expected', 'cheesy', 'stuff', 'be', 'honest', 'Was', 'mistake', 'bring', 'Isaac', 'back', 'when', 'looking', 'other', 'films', 'wanting', 'make', 'sense', 'yes', 'being', 'B', 'horror', 'movie', 'think', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'ok.', 'My', 'question', 'though', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'back', 'Malachi', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'film', 'had', 'commentary', 'John', 'Tim', 'Kari', 'John', 'Tim', 'least']",Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return VHS

The past two viewing tend to suggest that I'd have been better off if I'd stopped with 4, but then I would just spent the remainder of my life wondering what might have been.  Much like in 5, I don't know if their is anything too terribly grating or stunningly incompetent about the film as a whole, it's just rather uneventful and fairly dull.  As you may have surmised, Isaac is back, and he's still a jerk. This is kinda fun, but John Franklin's mere presence isn't worth too much, and he really doesn't do much of anything.  Another plus is that the film is occasionally slightly atmospheric.  Only occasionally, and only very slightly, but it's somethin'.  Unfortunately, CotC 666 lacks the laugh out loud hilarity of the better portions of 2 and 3, and the slightly intriguing plot and decent gore of 4.  So, we aren't left with much.  The climax is passably involving, and amusingly nonsensical, but overall it's a long journey to nowhere.  That, and where's the killing?  This film has only got a single sexy teen, rather than a pack of them, so we have very few preliminary killings. (Well, the protagonists in the CotC films usually weren't very sexy, but you get my meaning.)  A few of those would've spiced things up substantially, but this is all we got.I had an okay time watching this, but I really can't think of any reason why you ought to see it unless you have some bizarre compulsion to see all the CotC films.

For roughly three decades the Maine writer churned out book after book, each one selling more and more copies. He's a world unto himself, the lucky fellow! He's so successful that he could throw out his pens, put away his typewriters, bury his word processor six feet under, never write another word in his life, and STILL have enough money to wallpaper the Great Wall of China five times over. In many respects, it's Stephen King's world and the rest of us are just living in it. But, and this is a gigantic but, an enormous number of metaphysically bad films based on his novels threaten to put a serious dent in his legacy. We all know the good ones, the ones that not only scared audiences stiff but also helped propel King's career to even greater heights. ""Carrie"" is probably the best example, followed by ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Dead Zone."" These are wonderful, magical films that one can watch again and again without wearying of them. Then there are the rest: the truly wretched refuse that reminds one of dental plaque or the junk that washes up on the shores of a filthy river. Welcome to the Children of the Corn franchise.""Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return"" introduces us to Hannah (Natalie Ramsey), a young lady heading back to the now infamous Gatlin, Nebraska in order to answer some important personal questions: why am I drawn to a town out in the sticks? Who is my mother and where is she? Will accepting this role in a schlock, straight to video clunker enhance my career opportunities? You can quickly grasp the metaphysical importance of such ponderings. In quick succession, Hannah runs into a string of problems. Pushy town cop Cora (Alix Koromzay) gives her sass before she even arrives in town. Doc Michaels (Stacy Keach), the town quack, insists on imprinting his own weird impressions on the girl. But the most bizarre occurrence confronting Hannah during her first visit to Gatlin is the sight of a short man hooked up to a slew of machines in a hospital. This figure is none other than Isaac (John Franklin), the original apostle of ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"" in the first film. Apparently, the boyish preacher did not perish at the end of ""Children of the Corn,"" although it sure looked like it then, but slipped into a deep coma that has rendered him helpless for all these years. The arrival of Hannah, however, fulfills an old prophecy that will see Isaac out of his coma and possibly bring about a reemergence of the corn demon.As ""Children of the Corn 666"" progresses, not so much in a linear manner but in a serious of jerky fits and starts capable of inducing whiplash in the viewer, more of the ""storyline"" emerges for our consumption. It appears that many worshippers of ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"" survived the Peter Horton induced apocalypse at the end of the first film and grew up. They've been waiting all these years--raising their own children and acting like responsible adults--for Isaac to awaken from his slumber and call forth the demon. Why? I don't know. Since cult members always considered anyone over the age of eighteen the enemy, I can't imagine why grown people would welcome the malevolent corn god with open arms. Wouldn't he just pop up out of the earth and rip every person with age wrinkles and five o'clock shadow into bloody pulp? The whole subplot involving Hannah's reunion with her mother Rachel (Nancy Allen) withers when confronted with fundamental questions the movie refuses to ask, let alone answer. It should go without saying that numerous individuals find the idea of a possible Isaac/corn devil reconciliation an unpalatable situation. These are the people who end up on the wrong end of scythes and other sharp objects.What we have here is such a mess of a film that it easily ranks as the worst entry in the franchise. So many characters parade past the screen, from Gabriel (Paul Popowich) to Jake (William Prael) to a dozen others that it's impossible to keep it all straight. Only the presence of the attractive Natalie Ramsey and the very gorgeous Sydney Bennet in the role of cranky Morgan help keep this film down on stomachs made queasy with banalities. John Franklin, who also co-wrote the script, doesn't do much beyond what he did in the first film. Sure, he issues the usual biblical mumbo jumbo pronouncements to adoring audiences, but his middle age mug and rougher voice tell us this isn't the Isaac we remember from the first film. Is it possible for the chief apostle of a demon to collect Social Security checks, particularly when said demon makes it a point to hype the virtues of youth? Like I wrote earlier, there are more questions here than answers. By the time the film shudders to a halt, all I could bring myself to praise was the gore, and there is precious little of that floating around compared to other entries in the series.The DVD contains no extras, which is just as well because that would require the viewer to spend more time with this no account film. I suggest you skip, forget, overlook, reject, condemn, avoid, cast off, jettison, exile, dump, burn, pass over, disregard, denounce, discard, and abandon ""Children of the Corn 666"" as quickly as possible. Rearrange your sock drawer, change the furnace filters in your house, or reattach those plastic thingies to your shoelaces--do anything you can think of to avoid this atrocity. If you must see it, good luck and may god be with you.",1,Oh the humanity!,1103932800,"12 25, 2004",2004,5532,"['other', 'author', 'recent', 'memory', 'had', 'much', 'consistent', 'success',

And in the end he burns the corn down and in the background Of course, it did not go that way at all. The plotline was stupid, about a girl named Hannah who wishes to know the whereabouts of her mother and goes to Gatlin. The plotline didn't make sense, the clues to find her mom went nowhere and truely the writers were probably stumped themselves, even though the clues were going to the hole, she still found out about her mother. And by our future series, we know what was going to happen to Isaac. But the plot could've been better, dont you agree?  the whole movie should be a remake. The Gore scenes were weak and the movie felt like a boring History lecture. The only ""good"" parts of the film was in the ending where they start to kill each other off. And what was up with that old man who had nothing to do with the movie? Seriously, people, my thought on the movie was better then this mess. It was just a movie made to burn off money.

O'Blenis,"[7, 9]","To be honest, I rented this out of sheer desperation a couple of years ago, having seen virtually every other horror movie for rent in town (this was before everybody started stocking a dozen new horror titles a month, a welcome development).  I'd seen 2 or 3 of the earlier installments and not been impressed and given up on the series.  I'm not trying to bash them, I know alot of people really love the whole series, but the original and the first sequel just didn't do anything for me personally.  I'm not sure whether I even saw ""Urban Harvest"" or not -  I guess I couldn't have cared for it too much if I did.  But I took a chance on this one, breaking my own rule of Never skipping ahead in a series (3, 4 and 5 weren't available) and was certainly glad I did.Very few times have I gone into a movie with such low expectations and been so totally blown away in surprise.  ""Children Of The Corn 666: Isaac's Return"" is an absolute treasure find!  It involves a young woman in search of her past and ending up in the farm town central to the series, notorious for events that happened there previously.  The town's cult of children are apparantly in remission, maintaining a facade of normalcy in a community where adults now live as well, the children of the cult biding their time and waiting for some kind of promised dark messiah.  I don't really know how closely this fits into the overall series continuity; after seeing this I decided to see all the other chapters but have only seen the follow-up, ""Revelation"", a good movie but not on par with this one and quite unconnected to it.  The previous chapters can't be found for rent and I've already decided I'm going to have to eventually buy them sight unseen (the only reason I haven't done so yet is there are about 500 other movies on my personal 'waiting-to-be-bought' list) but haven't seen them yet, so I don't know if everything fits together or not.A soaring high point of the movie is a romantic angle which I won't go into too much here, occuring as it does later in the movie.  It includes one tremendously sexy scene that achieves its appeal not by being especially overt (not that I'm opposed to other, more openly sexy scenes in different movies), but through the high romanticism and beautiful tenderness.  And yes, the female character's limited clothing in the scene certainly doesn't hurt things either, although it would have been gorgeous even without that added benefit.Intelligent, suspenseful, and well-acted, this is highly recommended for either longtime fans of the series or those who (like me) never were into it before.  I might even give the original another try someday and see if there's something there I missed.  My only grievance is the ending - this isn't giving anything away, but it could have gone in either of two directions and I would have preferred the road they didn't take.  That's purely subjective and doesn't mean the final minutes weren't just as well realized as the rest of the movie.  I hope there's a direct followup to this entry with the same characters - the next sequel was a totally different path and different people.  Still good, but this one is awesome.",5,Excellent;  Twenty Times Better Than I Expected,1103328000,"12 18, 2004",2004,3178,"['be', 'honest', 'rented', 'sheer', 'desperation', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'having', 'seen', 'virtually', 'other', 'horror', 'movie', 'rent', 'town', 'was', 'everybody', 'started', 'stocking', 'dozen', 'new', 'horror', 'month', 'welcome', 'development', ""'d"", 'seen', '2', '3', 'earlier', 'installments', 'not', 'been', 'impressed', 'given', 'up', 'series', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'bash', 'know', 'alot', 'people', 'really', 'love', 'whole', 'series', 'original', 'first', 'sequel', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'personally', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'even', 'saw', 'Urban', 'Harvest', 'not', 'guess', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'cared', 'too', 'much', 'did', 'took', 'chance', 'one', 'breaking', 'own', 'rule', 'Never', 'skipping', 'ahead', 'series', '3', '4', '5', 'were', ""n't"", 'available', 'was', 'certainly', 'glad', 'did.Very', 'few', 'times', 'have', 'gone', 'movie', 'such', 'low', 'expectations', 'been', 'so', 'totally', 'blown', 'away', 'surprise', 'Children', 'Corn', '666', 'Isaac', 'Return', 'absolute', 'treasure', 'find', 'young', 'woman', 'search', 'past', 'ending', 'up', 'farm', 'town', 'central', 'series', 'notorious', 'events', 'happened', 'previously', 'town', 'cult', 'children', 'are', 'apparantly', 'remission', 'maintaining', 'facade', 'normalcy', 'community', 'where', 'adults', 'now', 'live', 'as', 'well', 'children', 'cult', 'biding', 'time', 'waiting', 'kind', 'promised', 'dark', 'messiah', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'how', 'closely', 'overall', 'series', 'continuity', 'seeing', 'decided', 'see', 'other', 'chapters', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'follow-up', 'Revelation', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'par', 'one', 'quite', 'unconnected', 'previous', 'chapters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'found', 'rent', ""'ve"", 'already', 'decided', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'eventually', 'buy', 'sight', 'unseen', 'only', 'reason', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'so', 'yet', 'are', '500', 'other', 'movies', 'personal', ""'waiting-to-be-bought"", 'list', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'everything', 'together', 'not.A', 'soaring', 'high', 'point', 'movie', 'romantic', 'angle', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'occuring', 'later', 'movie', 'one', 'tremendously', 'sexy', 'scene', 'appeal', 'not', 'being', 'especially', 'overt', 'not', ""'m"", 'opposed', 'other', 'more', 'openly', 'sexy', 'scenes', 'different', 'movies', 'high', 'romanticism', 'beautiful', 'tenderness', 'yes', 'female', 'character', 'limited', 'clothing', 'scene', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'things', 'either', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'gorgeous', 'even', 'added', 'benefit.Intelligent', 'suspenseful', 'well-acted', 'highly', 'recommended', 'longtime', 'fans', 'series', 'who', 'never', 'were', 'might', 'even', 'give', 'original', 'try', 'someday', 'see', 'something', 'there', 'missed', 'only', 'grievance', 'ending', ""n't"", 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'two', 'directions', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'road', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'purely', 'subjective', ""n't"", 'mean', 'final', 'minutes', 'were', ""n't"", 'just', 'as', 'well', 'realized', 'rest', 'movie', 'hope', 'direct', 'followup', 'entry', 'same', 'characters', 'next', 'sequel', 'was', 'totally', 'different', 'path', 'different', 'people', 'Still', 'good', 'one', 'awesome']",Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return VHS

I swear this movie is terrible, slow, boring, and pointless.If it weren't for the fact that I am very liberal with the way I view movies I would never of have picked this up.  Here is the basic idea, the children form the first are grown up.  In the mean time the daughter of one of the origional children returns to find her birth mother.  The birth Mother is played by Nancy Allen for a whole 15 20 minutes.  Issac also returns to raise hell.  There is a new prophecy, the first son and the first daughter of the origional children will mate and then he who walks behind the rows will be reborn.
