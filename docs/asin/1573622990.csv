The two leads are beautiful(Indira Varma, and Sarita Choudhury). The problem with this film is that all of the  effort was put into the design of the film, and not the plot. The film does  have some interesting parts to it, but it is uneven. It is still worth a  look. It makes me wonder ... if this film was named &quot;A Tale Of  Love&quot;, instead of Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love, would this film had made  more sense.

189216,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,1573622990,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[8, 16]","I believe that I would like to place a moment of blame on this film.  Due to the title alone, I was nervous about viewing it with the windows open.  Prior to my viewing, I was unaware that it was directed by famed director Mira Nair, and was fully prepared to draw my blinds as I embarked on this film adventure.  The title was Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love, what was I to assume.  After watching nearly two hours of this film, I was disappointed.  I was upset with not only the lack of commitment to the characters, the tired storyline, and the anti-climactic ending, but also due to the lack of sexuality surrounding this film.  ""Kama Sutra"" headlines this feature, but alas, it is not the central focus, and this is where I believe Nair failed us and my moment of blame was born.  I would like to make it clear that I did not desire a film of pornography, I knew that this was a ""mainstream"" film, but I did want something deeper and centered around the art of ""Kama Sutra"" instead of just another clich? story of rival girlfriends.  I realize that I am generalizing the overall theme of this film, but at the core of this movie it was not about the art of sex, but instead the decay of man.I did not like this film.  For several reasons, I felt that Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love was bland, void of emotion, and unoriginal.  I understood this film to be considered an adult fairy tale, but alas, I never saw the elements of a fairy tale in this story.  Written in part by Nair, I saw this film as her opportunity to demonstrate the power of a woman's sexuality over even the strongest of men.  In a very small part she succeeded, but her attempt to build this opportunity failed with her characters.  When you make a film centered on love, or the passion of its act, you must hire actors that will give the audience that sensation.  The audience must feel the sweat, the energy, the excitement of what is happening on screen or it will fall swiftly into just another Skin-a-Max midnight movie.  Sadly, Nair could not accomplish this.  When her characters, whether it was Maya, Tara, Raj, or even Jai, were ""forced"" into the ""Kama Sutra"" part of the film, it felt scripted and staged.  There was no instant passion between these characters, which destroyed, utterly ripped from its roots, any attempt that Nair had to create the theme of sexual independence.  Without the fire behind her actor's eyes, the rest of the film fell to the wayside as just your ""average"" film.Nair had another opportunity to capture back her audience with this film, but she never took it.  Nair could have pulled a Gandhi-esque moment for us by countering the horrible acting with beautiful images of India.  Nair could have coupled the beauty of ""Kama Sutra"" with the beauty of the land, thus creating at least one moment of visual eye-candy for the viewers, but again, she did no such thing.  The few moment of fresh scenery that we had seemed like it came from National Geographic stock footage.  I realize that she was actually in India, but what concerned me was that I didn't feel like I was in India.  Throughout the film I realized that I was sitting on my couch watching bad acting with recycled images of India.  I was nowhere close to being swept away by a lavish love story.  Wait.  This wasn't an original lavish love story.  This was nothing more than the clich? story of two friends whom find themselves fighting over the same man with a foreign twist.  Perhaps I needed more influx into India's culture or even more back-story on our smaller characters, but nothing took my breath away.  The character's lack of passion cheated me, and now Nair's choice of scenery felt just as plastic.Finally, I would like to say that (without giving anything away); the ending was rather lackluster.  Void of emotion to our characters and obvious clich? India images only strengthened the forgettable ending.  Again, the title of this film was Kama Sutra, which invokes images of lust and passion, sadly the ending evoked nothing of the sort.  There wasn't a care in the world for our characters, so why should we feel impassioned about them in the final climactic moments?  I didn't.  As I watched this film I felt as if I was on a Disney ride through India.  The tracks were in place so my cart couldn't go off the forsaken path, while the robotic characters did what they were supposed to do without any surprises or excitement.  The only character (and I hate to go back on this rant again, but it is the central reason this film fell hard) worth enjoying was that of Naveen Andrews, but I think it is because of his Lost connection.  By the time the ending finally happened, I was sculpting my own story in rock and hoping that Hollywood would produce it.Overall, this film did have potential, but by giving it a name like Kama Sutra it over promised and ultimately did not deliver.  Again, I would like to make it clear that I was not hoping for a heavily sexual film, but it needed to be a stronger point in the story than just a ""quick-cut"" or a side quest.  Kama Sutra failed because of its characters and their obvious lack of devotion to the story.  There were no surprises, there was no excitement, and there was no romance, just clich? plot points that you can see in any film across the fine Earth.  Could Nair been more adventurous?  This reviewer thinks so.  She could have taken us off the beaten path, deeper within the darkness, but instead she glossed over the truth giving us a Kama Sutra that was more pastel than passionate.  As you walk by this film in the future, do not be fooled by the title, the contents of the box do not match the visuals it promises!Grade: ** out of *****",2,I don't love you enough to hate

189217,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,1573622990,Amanda Richards,"[63, 64]","Hotter than ""Fire"", but without the same depth of emotion and not much of a story line, Kama Sutra comes over as a beautiful art movie, with magnificent scenery, brilliant color, and maximum use of nature, light and texture.  Yes, there are also love scenes that are not for the prudish, and some full frontal female nudity and bare backsides, but in essence it is a story of love and loss and debauchery and death.Indira Varma is captivating as the servant girl Maya, portraying her as young, flirtatious and resilient, while at the same time, regal and vulnerable.  Her lovely eyes speak volumes, and there are entire scenes that are conveyed without the need for dialogue.Sarita Choudhury plays a major supporting role as Tara, the intended bride of Raj Singh (Naveen Andrews). Although a lifelong friend of Maya, she turns on her in a fit of jealousy when the Raj lets his gaze wander to Maya on their very first meeting, and her reaction causes Maya to flee the room in shame.Seeking revenge, Maya makes a pre-marital visit to the Raj, and gives herself to him in a performance that he never forgets.She however forgets that people who live in transparent tents shouldn't fool around, and when the night's events are disclosed by Tara's humpbacked peeping tom of a brother, whom Maya has rejected outright as a husband, she has no choice but to leave her home as a fallen woman.Unlike the popular advertisement however, she is able to get up, and thanks to the artistic skill of a stone carver Jai Kumar (Ramon Tikaram) and the friendship and teaching of Rasa Devi, (Screen legend Rehka) teacher of the Kama Sutra, she finds new confidence and a whole new attitude.  She falls for Jai big time, but unfortunately for him, he doesn't react well to unconditional love and chases her straight into the open arms of Raj Singh as his #1 favorite courtesan.Tara is now living the life of the neglected wife of a debauched husband, and has a disastrous wedding night when he calls her another woman's name.  Her unhappiness is aggravated when she discovers Maya lolling off in a hot tub at the palace, and unable to cope with her situation decides on a drastic course of action.Raj is by now totally obsessed with Maya, and when he discovers that his stone carver friend and his number one girl have not only rekindled the flames, but are busy fanning them when he's not around, he goes berserk, and orders the appropriate punishment for Jai.To close things off, while Raj has been partying, his kingdom has been falling, and you don't need a fat lady singing to tell you that it's over for him.Excellent performances by Indira Varma, Sarita Choudhury and Rekha make this movie worthwhile, and the attention to detail by Mira Nair makes for beautiful watching.Amanda Richards, December 29, 2004",4,A tale of love about the art of love,1104192000,"12 28, 2004",2004,2792,"['Hotter', 'Fire', 'same', 'depth', 'emotion', 'not', 'much', 'story', 'line', 'Kama', 'Sutra', 'over', 'beautiful', 'art', 'movie', 'magnificent', 'scenery', 'brilliant', 'color', 'maximum', 'use', 'nature', 'light', 'texture', 'Yes', 'are', 'also', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'prudish', 'full', 'frontal', 'female', 'nudity', 'bare', 'backsides', 'essence', 'story', 'love', 'loss', 'debauchery', 'death.Indira', 'Varma', 'captivating', 'servant', 'girl', 'Maya', 'portraying', 'young', 'flirtatious', 'resilient', 'same', 'time', 'regal', 'vulnerable', 'lovely', 'eyes', 'speak', 'volumes', 'are', 'entire', 'scenes', 'are', 'conveyed', 'need', 'dialogue.Sarita', 'Choudhury', 'major', 'supporting', 'role', 'Tara', 'intended', 'bride', 'Raj', 'Singh', 'Naveen', 'Andrews', 'lifelong', 'friend', 'Maya', 'fit', 'jealousy', 'when', 'Raj', 'gaze', 'wander', 'Maya', 'very', 'first', 'meeting', 'reaction', 'Maya', 'flee', 'room', 'shame.Seeking', 'revenge', 'Maya', 'pre-marital', 'visit', 'Raj', 'performance', 'never', 'forgets.She', 'however', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'transparent', 'tents', 'should', ""n't"", 'fool', 'around', 'when', 'night', 'events', 'are', 'disclosed', 'Tara', 'humpbacked', 'peeping', 'tom', 'brother', 'whom', 'Maya', 'rejected', 'outright', 'husband', 'choice', 'leave', 'home', 'fallen', 'popular', 'advertisement', 'however', 'able', 'get', 'up', 'thanks', 'artistic', 'skill', 'stone', 'carver', 'Jai', 'Kumar', 'Ramon', 'Tikaram', 'friendship', 'teaching', 'Rasa', 'Devi', 'Screen', 'legend', 'Rehka', 'teacher', 'Kama', 'Sutra', 'new', 'confidence', 'whole', 'new', 'attitude', 'Jai', 'big', 'time', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'react', 'well', 'unconditional', 'love', 'straight', 'open', 'arms', 'Raj', 'Singh', '1', 'favorite', 'courtesan.Tara', 'now', 'living', 'life', 'neglected', 'wife', 'debauched', 'husband', 'disastrous', 'wedding', 'night', 'when', 'woman', 'name', 'unhappiness', 'aggravated', 'when', 'Maya', 'lolling', 'off', 'hot', 'tub', 'palace', 'unable', 'cope', 'situation', 'drastic', 'course', 'action.Raj', 'now', 'totally', 'obsessed', 'Maya', 'when', 'stone', 'carver', 'friend', 'number', 'one', 'girl', 'have', 'not', 'only', 'rekindled', 'flames', 'are', 'busy', 'fanning', 'when', 'not', 'around', 'berserk', 'orders', 'appropriate', 'punishment', 'Jai.To', 'close', 'things', 'off', 'Raj', 'been', 'partying', 'kingdom', 'been', 'falling', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'fat', 'lady', 'singing', 'tell', 'over', 'him.Excellent', 'performances', 'Indira', 'Varma', 'Sarita', 'Choudhury', 'Rekha', 'make', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'attention', 'detail', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'beautiful', 'watching.Amanda', 'Richards', 'December', '29', '2004']",N/A

Is this a bad thing?  It just depends on how much that style of melodrama appeals to you.  It doesn't work for me much, but I can go for the sex instead of musical numbers, though.

The movie actually centers around the character Maya (not played by Sarita Choudhury) who grows up as a servant and playmate of Tara (who is played by Sarita Choudhury).  Both are somewhat jealous of the other - Maya because she gets Tara's hand me downs and is indeed treated like the servant she is - and Tara because Maya is more beautiful and accomplished than she is.  On the night of Tara's wedding to a Raj, Maya slaps Tara during an argument, who gets revenge by sleeping with Maya's husband to be.  Needless to say, Maya is driven from the house in shame.  Forced into difficult circumstances she becomes the courtesan of Maya's new husband, and takes every opportunity to rub this fact in Maya's face.  However, in the meantime she falls in love with a commoner and tries to re-forge a bond of friendship with Tara who quickly discovers being the wife of a Prince is not quite what she imagined it to be.

189231,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,1573622990,Erica Anderson,"[6, 6]","""Kama Sutra"" is a a beautiful, sensuous film directed by ""Monsoon Wedding"" and ""Vanity Fair"" director Mira Nair. The story revolves around Maya (Indira Varma). Maya grows up in a lower caste unlike her best friend Tara (Sarita Chodhury) who is born into a wealthy, privileged family. After being humilated in public by Tara, Maya takes it upon herself by seducing her soon-to-be ex-bestfriend's future husband Raj (Naveen Andrews) on the night of the wedding. When Tara's brother catches the couple in their tent together, he exposes all which leads to Maya going into exile.Maya meets up with an artist Jai Kumar (Ramon Tikarum). He later introduces her to Rasa Devi (Rekha) who teaches the philosophies of the kama sutra to a group of young women. When Jai initially pushes Maya away when she declares that she is in love with him, Maya turns to Raj and becomes his royal courtesan. This makes Raj's wife and Maya's former best friend Tara insanely jealous and insecure.I enjoyed this film. I loved the lush scenery and the beautiful costumes. I thought the love scenes were done tastefully and without being explicit for the sake of being explicit. While there wasn't really much of a plot, I still thought the writing was entertaining. One of my favorite scenes was when Maya went with Jai to a brothel dressed up as a man.After seeing the stunning Indira Varma in ""Bride and Prejudice"" earlier this year, I have been curious about her film work. I think it is funny that she and Naveen Andrews would later work together in that film after ""Kama Sutra"". It was real interesting how their relationship in ""Kama Sutra"" differed (greatly) from their characters' relationship in ""Bride and Prejudice"".My only issue with the film is the way that it ended. I do not care for films that leave on an open note. I feel so unsatisfied when films end without any closure but that is probably what Mira Nair wanted. All in all, I liked ""Kama Sutra"". The entire cast was great. They all put in excellent performances.

It's not a horrible movie, but it's not great either. Though the lead actress is hot- she can't act, so in the end it just looks like some horny producers wanted to see boobies & didn't care as much about the end product of their film. Seems when given the choice between acquiring a talented actress and getting some no-talent woman who'd be willing to have her nipples sucked by a stranger on camera, they decided on the latter. I liked the music & also there are poignant scenes showing rape followed by arranged marriage and even pedophilia in the selling of pre-pubescant girls. Though a couple of the actors did well amongst a sea of bad, the script offered them a poor foundation & it gets more & more soap-opera as it goes along. If the movie suddenly stopped playing 3/4th of the way through I wouldn't have cared much- which is a sign of it's ability to grab the audience right there. As far as the controversial scenes go: we see an actor clearly sucking on the actress's nipples, licking, biting and grabbing very private parts.- Not just portraying this, but actually DOING it on screen. I'm in no way a religious nut, but I believe that (aside from porn) such intimate things should remain private rather than between an entire audience and film crew. Not because it is ""wrong"" or ""dirty"", but rather because:a) It does nothing to advance the story or plot in any way.b) It takes the audience out of being immersed in the movie for a moment as they suddenly get whacked with the thought- Oh my god- what are these actors doing? And therefore doesn't serve the art of the film.c) If done too often It can take away from the specialness and enticement of the act desensitizing an audience to lesser acts on screen which may actually be more meaningful.Nudity is fine if it advances a story or makes a statement, but here it does none of that. The men show no real nudity at any time- It's only the women. You could argue that this makes a statement about women being made vulnerable and subserviant in a patriarichal society, but there was definitely no statement in the intimate moments that crossed the line and the characters desperately lacked depth. The creators of this film failed at fully realizing the politics they tried to bring up. (And it was all brought up rather sloppily if I might add) I almost want to give this an extra star because I enjoyed watching the nice colors the film uses & the music, but I figure in a review it's best to speak about the story, the acting & the script which was all sub-par and it seems the top critics agreed with my sentiments.",2,Ehhhh,1280707200,"08 2, 2010",2010,2665,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'resembling', 'soft', 'porn-', ""'ve"", 'found', 'here', 'not', 'horrible', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'either', 'lead', 'actress', 'hot-', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'so', 'end', 'just', 'horny', 'producers', 'wanted', 'see', 'boobies', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'as', 'much', 'end', 'product', 'film', 'when', 'given', 'choice', 'acquiring', 'talented', 'actress', 'getting', 'no-talent', 'woman', 'who', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'have', 'nipples', 'sucked', 'stranger', 'camera', 'decided', 'latter', 'liked', 'music', 'also', 'are', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'showing', 'rape', 'followed', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'even', 'pedophilia', 'selling', 'pre-pubescant', 'girls', 'couple', 'actors', 'did', 'well', 'amongst', 'sea', 'bad', 'script', 'offered', 'poor', 'foundation', 'more', 'more', 'soap-opera', 'along', 'movie', 'suddenly', 'stopped', 'playing', '3/4th', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'cared', 'much-', 'sign', 'ability', 'grab', 'audience', 'right', 'there', 'As', 'far', 'controversial', 'scenes', 'go', 'see', 'actor', 'clearly', 'sucking', 'actress', 'nipples', 'licking', 'biting', 'grabbing', 'very', 'private', 'parts.-', 'Not', 'just', 'portraying', 'actually', 'screen', ""'m"", 'way', 'religious', 'nut', 'believe', 'aside', 'porn', 'such', 'intimate', 'things', 'should', 'remain', 'private', 'rather', 'entire', 'audience', 'film', 'crew', 'Not', 'wrong', 'dirty', 'rather', 'nothing', 'advance', 'story', 'plot', 'way.b', 'audience', 'being', 'immersed', 'movie', 'moment', 'suddenly', 'get', 'whacked', 'thought-', 'Oh', 'god-', 'what', 'are', 'actors', 'doing', 'therefore', ""n't"", 'serve', 'art', 'film.c', 'done', 'too', 'often', 'can', 'take', 'away', 'specialness', 'enticement', 'act', 'desensitizing', 'audience', 'lesser', 'acts', 'screen', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'more', 'meaningful.Nudity', 'fine', 'story', 'statement', 'here', 'none', 'men', 'show', 'real', 'nudity', 'time-', 'only', 'women', 'could', 'argue', 'statement', 'women', 'being', 'made', 'vulnerable', 'subserviant', 'patriarichal', 'society', 'there', 'was', 'definitely', 'statement', 'intimate', 'moments', 'crossed', 'line', 'characters', 'desperately', 'lacked', 'depth', 'creators', 'film', 'failed', 'fully', 'realizing', 'politics', 'tried', 'bring', 'up', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'rather', 'sloppily', 'might', 'add', 'almost', 'want', 'give', 'extra', 'star', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'nice', 'colors', 'film', 'music', 'figure', 'review', 'best', 'speak', 'story', 'acting', 'script', 'was', 'sub-par', 'top', 'critics', 'agreed', 'sentiments']",N/A

""A New Yorker""","[5, 5]","A beautifully atmospheric film with a gorgeous and exotic cast, Kama Sutra comes across as more of an erotic soap opera than anything else. Mira Nair, who also directed ""Mississippi Malsala"", paces her film with a slow and deliberate burn--much like the passions which ignite between her film's characters. Mira Nair directs a very powerful and talented cast and she has created a beautiful, colorful, cinematic tribute to love and its consequences.While some may find the plot too familiar, I really enjoyed the performance of Indira Varma, playing the lead role of Maya, the servant girl. The beautiful and sexy Varma does a credible job building her character from a naive, young waif into a strong, independent woman. Ramon Tikaram. I think he steals the show with his beautiful portrayal of a passionate stone cutter who falls for the mesmerizing courtesan Maya. The tension and chaos between characters is thick and real.This DVD has a moderate number of features like wide and full frame formats, director's commentary, a theatrical trailer, filmography, language selection, and animated interactive menus.

189239,A8F2AZWB20X1H,1573622990,JLind555,"[11, 11]","Set in 16th century India, ""Kama Sutra"" is a seductive, sensual story of love, lust, and betrayal.  Mira Nair's hauntingly erotic film brings us a low-caste girl named Maya, who functions as both a servant and companion to Tara, who belongs to the Indian nobility.  Even as children, although Maya cleans up after Tara and wears Tara's cast-offs, it is Maya whose seductive charm entrances everyone who comes into contact with her; for all her family and financial connections, Tara is really living in Maya's shadow.Tara is destined for great things; she's engaged to be married to the spoiled and dissolute young king Raj Singh, while Maya is trained to be only a courtesan; but Maya knows how to put her training to good use; when Tara is formally introduced to her future husband, it is Maya's hypnotic eyes that bewitch him.  But Maya is prepared to go even further than this; for once, she will make Tara know what it feels like to feast on someone's leftovers.  Maya seduces Raj Singh on the night before his wedding.  By taking such an enormous step, she may become a social outcast, but Raj Singh is hooked; he will keep Tara as his wife, since he has to have a wife, but since Maya is the woman he really wants, he will keep her as his courtesan.It's a mess all around; Tara can't win her husband's love, she's as cold and sexually frigid as Maya is enchanting; but Maya soon becomes disgusted with Raj Singh's dissipation, and at this point she meets her soulmate, the sculptor Jai Kumar.  It's a love doomed from the start; the more Maya is repelled by Raj Singh, the more he desires her, and he'll never let her escape.  Something has to give, and something does.""Kama Sutra"" is not an especially deep movie; it doesn't have a convoluted plot and most of the characters are pretty two-dimensional; but as a straightforward tale of love and lust, it's eminently satisfying.  The setting in pre-colonial India with its exotic atmosphere and lavish costumes makes for a stunning eyeful, and the actors play their parts to the hilt.  Indira Varma makes a luminous Mayra; her sensuality steams up the screen; and Sarita Choudhury is convincing as Tara, the unloved and jealous wife.  The male actors, Naveen Andrews as Raj Singh and Ramon Tikram as Jai Kumar, are good, but they don't stand out as much as the women because their roles are not as compelling; ""Kama Sutra"" is essentially a women's film, directed by woman and telling a woman's story.

189240,A245AST0T0AZTJ,1573622990,J. Lindner,"[5, 5]","I wasn't sure what to expect when I first sat down to watch this movie.  That it was set in pre-colonial India made it appealing as I figured there would not be a cultural battle between east and west in it.  This is true and the story developed well as a result.  The story follows, roughly, the lives of two girls as they grow to adulthood, each with her own ambition.  The story is somewhat disjointed as the stories are not intertwined as much as perhaps they should have been, but the overall effect is still a good movie to watch.We do not get much insight into Indian society other than the king was the ultimate ruler who could determine life and death.  While women were subserviant to men, common in many eastern traditions, they still held more power than one might imagine.  The Kama Sutra gave women knowledge in dealing with men on both a physical and emotional level.  While men can be far more physical than women, it is the emotional part of life that gives it all depth and meaning.We follow the story primarily of one of the girls, Maya, a beauty who has captivated the king but has sacrificed her own virtue through a moment of youthful indiscretion.  She cannot be queen but only a favorite courtisan.  She eventually falls in love with a commoner, a sculptor by trade, but he rejects her primarily because of his own selfish vanity.  Eventually the sculptor angers the king and all of Maya's pleadings will not spare his life.  The king has troubles of his own, and we can only assume that his lack of interest in actual governmental affairs has allowed his rivals to conquer his landsThis movie moves at a good pace, but it can be erratic at times as it bouces around and reintroduces characters the viewer has all but forgotten about.  It has enough sensuality to make it appealing to many and the ultimate tragic end leaves the viewer wondering if Maya will even really find satisfaction in her life.",4,Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love,1299283200,"03 5, 2011",2011,1925,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'first', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'pre-colonial', 'India', 'made', 'appealing', 'figured', 'there', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'cultural', 'battle', 'east', 'west', 'true', 'story', 'developed', 'well', 'result', 'story', 'roughly', 'lives', 'two', 'girls', 'grow', 'adulthood', 'own', 'ambition', 'story', 'somewhat', 'disjointed', 'stories', 'are', 'not', 'intertwined', 'as', 'much', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'overall', 'effect', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'watch.We', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'insight', 'Indian', 'society', 'other', 'king', 'was', 'ultimate', 'ruler', 'who', 'could', 'determine', 'life', 'death', 'women', 'were', 'subserviant', 'men', 'common', 'many', 'eastern', 'traditions', 'still', 'held', 'more', 'power', 'one', 'might', 'imagine', 'Kama', 'Sutra', 'gave', 'women', 'knowledge', 'dealing', 'men', 'physical', 'emotional', 'level', 'men', 'can', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'physical', 'women', 'emotional', 'part', 'life', 'depth', 'meaning.We', 'follow', 'story', 'primarily', 'one', 'girls', 'Maya', 'beauty', 'who', 'captivated', 'king', 'sacrificed', 'own', 'virtue', 'moment', 'youthful', 'indiscretion', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'queen', 'only', 'favorite', 'courtisan', 'eventually', 'love', 'commoner', 'sculptor', 'trade', 'primarily', 'own', 'selfish', 'vanity', 'Eventually', 'sculptor', 'king', 'Maya', 'pleadings', 'will', 'not', 'spare', 'life', 'king', 'troubles', 'own', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'lack', 'interest', 'actual', 'governmental', 'affairs', 'allowed', 'rivals', 'conquer', 'landsThis', 'movie', 'moves', 'good', 'pace', 'can', 'be', 'erratic', 'times', 'around', 'characters', 'viewer', 'forgotten', 'enough', 'sensuality', 'make', 'appealing', 'many', 'ultimate', 'tragic', 'end', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'Maya', 'will', 'even', 'really', 'find', 'satisfaction', 'life']",N/A

As are her other films, ""Kama Sutra"" is an intelligent and mesmerizing story, peppered with excellent performances by a stellar cast.Set in sixteenth century India, this is the story of Maya (Indira Varma), a servant girl and companion to Tara (Sarita Choudry), a Maharani destined to be Queen to a Raj. Childhood friends, they are to become palace rivals as the fates pit them one against the other, only to have them both become casualties of love. Maya, tired of being treated as a second class citizen and of receiving Tara's castoff clothing, makes a life defining decision on the eve of Tara's marriage to Raj Singh (Naveen Andrews). Sensing that the Raj desires her, Maya gives herself to him, later telling Tara that it is she who now has a cast off from Maya.After Tara departs with her husband, Maya's perfidy is revealed to the household by Tara's hunchbacked brother, who, coveting Maya for himself, had spied upon her and saw her in flagrante delicto with the Raj. Ousted by Tara's outraged family, Maya leaves to make her way in the world. She comes across a sculptor, Jai Kumar (Ramon Tikarum), of Raj Singh's royal household and falls in love with him. Unfortunately, timing is everything. By the time Jai realizes that he, too, is in love with her, it is too late, as Maya is now the favorite courtesan of the by now debauched Raj, who is obsessed with her and cannot seem to get her out of his system, much to the dismay of Tara, as well as Jai.Trained in the arts of love by the graceful and beautiful Rasa Devi (Rekha), Maya, as a royal courtesan, is a sensuous, beautiful sylph. Tara, now the Queen, is insanely jealous of her husband's desire for Maya, but must tolerate it, as must Jai, as it is a culturally accepted way of life. Unfortunately, when the Raj discovers that Maya and Jai are still in love, all hell breaks loose, and the piper must be paid.This is a wonderful film of a woman's journey to find herself within culturally imposed constraints. It is a tale of the vicissitudes of life that leave imprints on one's journey. Told in the context of carnal love and desire, it also tells of a love sublime. This is essentially a woman's film, sensuous and erotic in its imagery, a veritable sumptuous feast for the senses. While there is some nudity in the film, it is tastefully and beautifully filmed, as well as highly erotic.Indira Varma, in what is her screen debut, is sensational as the entrancing Maya, imbuing her with an impishness, as well as with a sinuous and provocative sensuality. Sarita Choudry, of ""Mississippi Masala"" fame, is excellent as the beautiful and exotic Tara, who appears to be relegated to a life of frigidity and jealousy. Rekha, the well known and exquisitely beautiful Indian actress, is hypnotic as Rasa Devi, teacher of the Kama Sutra. Naveen Andrews gives a good performance as the debauched Raj, and Ramon Tikarum is compelling as the conflicted artist. They both, however, take a backseat to the women in the film.Filmed on location in India, this is a film that should be watched for its sheer beauty.

It's a tale about two girls.  They've been best friends for life.  Tara (Sarita Choudhury) is a princess, Maya (Indira Varma)is a servent girl.  But things turn sour years later, when the women are grown up.  On Tara's wedding night, Raj Singh (Naveen Andrews)is seduced by Maya's good looks, even though my dad thought Tara was better looking then Maya, and Tara, who is jealous of this, spits in Maya's face.  As a plan of revenge, Maya takes the bride's groom to bed with her.  Oh it gets much better, not!  Maya then confesses to Tara that she did it with Raj on the wedding night.  Tara who is devistaded, kicks Maya out of the palace.  Someone who is even more devistaded is Tara's perverted hunchback brother, he has an infatuation with Maya, yuck!Anyways, Maya is out in the real world now, and she wants to understand the fine arts of seduction, so she finds this school, with the teacher named Rasa Devi (Rekha)  Rasa teaches Maya the fine arts of seduction with the book Kama Sutra, suprise, suprise.  Well Maya also finds a love interest too, he is called Jai Kumar (Ramon Tikaram).  But at the time, he's only interested in scupluring her, oh yah he's a stone sculptor.  Then out of nowhere, the Raj shows up and wants Jai to sculp the woman he lusts for, that would be Maya.  So they both go to the palace with him, and he even challenges Jai to a friendly male-bonding wrestling match, but just how friendly are we talking here?Well now Maya is the top concubine for Raj.  Tara is insainly jealous, and she can't believe that she's married to a opium smoking playboy who lusts after Maya.  Maya even tries to rekindel her lost friendship with Tara, and at one time even helps her seduce her husband.  But that doesn't happen until the near end though.  But Jai is finally realising that he's in love with Maya, but it's kind of too late, because Maya is the top concubine of Raj.  And when Raj finds out that Maya is still in love with Jai, he plots his horrible revenge.  And perhaps it's Maya's presence in everyone's lives that leads to their destrution and the destruction of the monarcy.This is an interesting film, anyone who likes the Bollywood films, or films by Mira Nair, this film is for you!",5,An Interesting Bollywood Tale of Romance and Treachery,1201132800,"01 24, 2008",2008,2331,"['movie', 'seduced', 'daught', 'it.WARNING', 'THERE', 'MAY', 'BE', 'SPOILERSIt', 'place', '16th', 'century', 'India', 'tale', 'two', 'girls', ""'ve"", 'been', 'best', 'friends', 'life', 'Tara', 'Sarita', 'Choudhury', 'princess', 'Maya', 'Indira', 'Varma', 'servent', 'girl', 'things', 'turn', 'sour', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'women', 'are', 'grown', 'up', 'Tara', 'wedding', 'night', 'Raj', 'Singh', 'Naveen', 'Andrews', 'seduced', 'Maya', 'good', 'looks', 'even', 'dad', 'thought', 'Tara', 'was', 'better', 'looking', 'then', 'Maya', 'Tara', 'who', 'jealous', 'Maya', 'face', 'plan', 'revenge', 'Maya', 'bride', 'groom', 'bed', 'Oh', 'much', 'better', 'not', 'Maya', 'then', 'Tara', 'did', 'Raj', 'wedding', 'night', 'Tara', 'who', 'devistaded', 'kicks', 'Maya', 'palace', 'Someone', 'who', 'even', 'more', 'devistaded', 'Tara', 'perverted', 'hunchback', 'brother', 'infatuation', 'Maya', 'yuck', 'Anyways', 'Maya', 'out', 'real', 'world', 'now', 'understand', 'fine', 'arts', 'seduction', 'school', 'teacher', 'named', 'Rasa', 'Devi', 'Rekha', 'Rasa', 'Maya', 'fine', 'arts', 'seduction', 'book', 'Kama', 'Sutra', 'suprise', 'suprise', 'Well', 'Maya', 'also', 'love', 'interest', 'too', 'called', 'Jai', 'Kumar', 'Ramon', 'Tikaram', 'time', 'only', 'interested', 'scupluring', 'oh', 'yah', 'stone', 'sculptor', 'Then', 'nowhere', 'Raj', 'up', 'Jai', 'sculp', 'woman', 'would', 'be', 'Maya', 'go', 'palace', 'even', 'Jai', 'friendly', 'male-bonding', 'wrestling', 'match', 'just', 'how', 'friendly', 'are', 'talking', 'here', 'Well', 'now', 'Maya', 'top', 'concubine', 'Raj', 'Tara', 'insainly', 'jealous', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'married', 'opium', 'smoking', 'playboy', 'who', 'Maya', 'Maya', 'even', 'rekindel', 'lost', 'friendship', 'Tara', 'one', 'time', 'even', 'seduce', 'husband', ""n't"", 'happen', 'near', 'end', 'Jai', 'finally', 'realising', 'love', 'Maya', 'kind', 'too', 'late', 'Maya', 'top', 'concubine', 'Raj', 'when', 'Raj', 'out', 'Maya', 'still', 'love', 'Jai', 'plots', 'horrible', 'revenge', 'perhaps', 'Maya', 'presence', 'everyone', 'lives', 'destrution', 'destruction', 'monarcy.This', 'interesting', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'films', 'Mira', 'Nair', 'film']",N/A

189265,A1R7RSAMR1ST5M,1573622990,R.M.,"[11, 12]","Directed by Mira Nair, the talented force behind the recent Monsoon Wedding, Kama Sutra is an earlier take of her beautiful vision of India.  Ms. Nair has a flair for showing her native country with all its loveliness unfurled, entrancing people of all ilk with its endless vistas and melting sunsets.  How can we resist her India, with its beguiling glimpses of beautiful women and passionate men as sculpted as the statues that adorn the Hindu temples (often used as incidental scenery).  The colors in each frame, from the glinting edges of whirling saris to the flower petals that flow over the steps of the royal residence like a red river, are enchantingly brilliant.  They draw the viewer into this Technicolor world without hesitation.  With all this beautiful scenery, one wonders why Ms. Nair even bothers to have a plot.  Unfortunately, once one is done watching this movie, the question remains unanswered.Many people will rent this movie for its title, known for the famous book of sexual positions so widely read by college dorm-goers.  But if one is looking for a more visual reenactment of this lovely text, be prepared to be dispassionate.  Though the movie is superficially about the life of a courtesan, its sex scenes are carefully choreographed to prohibit any real sensuality from coming out.  Though the participants are beautiful, the end result lacks real passion, making these scenes a mere revel in the beauty of human form.  Unfortunately, as the plot hinges on these incidental sex scenes, the rest of the movie really doesn't move along.  We might care a little for Maya, the film's main figure, but her inability to free herself or her lover from their predicaments makes us wonder why the filmmaker made such a big deal about her supposed independence in the first place.If you would like a film to show you an ideal 15th century India abounding with glitter, look no further.

I don't think it is mastered from the original master film. When it starts, the screen is very spotty and crackly. You know, like the sound of bacon frying. But, it does fade to a minimum very quickly, and just little white spots pop up throughout the film.But, the sound quality is the real disappointment here. When people speak, it is very hissy. Everybody sounds like they have a lisp when they speak. But, again, that starts to minimize as you get deeper into the film.  And, what everyone will find extremely disappointing about the Indian released Blu-Ray, is that about 3 minutes of the film has been removed.Yes, that's right!  You've guess it!  The nudity has all been removed.India sure has a warped sense of values.  They don't mind showing bloodshed, police brutality and disrespectful behavior of one another, but when it comes to showing the beauty of God's creation (the naked female body), they censor it and remove it from the appreciative viewer's eye. India's got serious morality problems.  No wonder Indians that came to America from India raise their middle finger and wave it at their native country.Anyway, I'll keep both this DVD and the Blu-Ray disc because, in the long run, I do prefer a better picture, especially with a visually artful film such as this.You'll notice that the Blu-Ray disc isn't readily available in stores, or even sold by Amazon itself.

A perfectly guessable tale of unrequited love, scorn, and revenge thereof, is packaged with frequent bits of unnecessary sex (call it audience targeting).But even if I were to detach myself from exploring the Indianness in this film (the lack thereof, I mean) or its non-chalant labeling as Kama Sutra, in and of itself the movie is still quite an ordinary one.The theme, as simpleton as they come -- Maya (a conveniently dark-skinned Indira Verma much in keeping with a western stereotype of Indian nymphs) is reviled by her Prince husband and socially ostracized. She takes refuge under the aegis of an exotic dancer (played convincingly by a superbly controlled Rekha, the only respite amidst all this facade). This dance teacher supposedly coaches our modest protagonist in all the requisite moves and emotional shenanigans involved in inveigling a man.Lots of visual eye candy lines this bagatelle (not as much soft porn as some XY-chromosomes among you may wish for), some good costume designs, and an occasionally entertaining soundtrack.Nothing more.From a veteran of Mira Nair's cadre, one would perhaps expect more than that -- maybe even a complex story of sexual intrigue and character study. Instead, looks like she fancied unshackling some international mental barriers about eroticism in the oh-so-orthodox Indian society, which ends up being little more than a farce to real Indians. (A trend that she seems to have continued with Monsoon Wedding)Come to think of it, the whole plot reeks heavily of another movie, &quot;Dangerous Beauty&quot;, which btw is a must-watch, where a Venetian courtesan tackles a similar fate.

This is strongly hinted at in the trailers and preview for the film, in which Maya says that if she cannot use the Kama Sutra ""on the one she loves, she will use it on the one she hates.""  The film actually reveals very little about the Kama Sutra, despite promises scattered throughout the film.  This in itself was a big dissapointment.  The film is very erotic and sensual, however, sure to offend some viewers.  But what keeps the film from being excellent are two things.  First, much of it is painfully obvious though it's trying for subtle, and second, the central conflict (Maya vs. Tara) is never fully explored.

Their childhood years were acted by two lovely, coltish teenagers who only hint at how gorgeous the adult women will be. Low-caste Maya adds training to beauty in becoming a courtesan, with men her life for her pleasure as well as men in her life for their own pleasure. High-born Maya's looks seduce a king into marrying her. The years in front of each one promise happiness, even a chance at love.Their own jealousies, combined with jealousies around them, break that promise. Maya resents Tara's wealth, Tara envies Maya's grace and allure, and so on until utter collapse. In the end, only Maya seems to escape unharmed - she starts life with nearly nothing, and in the end walks into exile with neary nothing, just the clothes on her back. But, in between, she gains a wealth of knowledge and memory that can never be taken away.Intimate encounters vary, as they do in real life. The finest are warm, gentle, enticing expressions physical love, with real feeling enhanced by training in the skills of love. The worst come from a terrible mismatch of wedding-night expectations: Maya's virginal fear against his animal urges and belief in a skilled seductress, a failure that contaminates their feelings forever.The story of loves gained, lost, and stillborn will appeal to some viewers.
