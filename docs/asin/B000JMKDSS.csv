1028975,A30QSLHX2HC9GE,B000JMKDSS,Aaron Von Raschke,"[0, 0]","SERUM is basically about a doctor named Dr. Eddie Kanopolus (David H. Hickey) who is obsessed with developing a miracle drug that can cure any disease. When his funding suddenly becomes jeopardized and his nephew is hit by a vehicle and puts him into a coma, he's forced to do something drastic to find the final ingredient for his serum: brain fluid from a live human. His experiment eventually goes wrong, creating a zombie-like creature that goes on a brain-eating rampage in the nearby town. There's also a subplot with his nephew (also named Eddie) and his girlfriend making amends, trying to patch up a relationship gone bad.I've never been big on Medical Horror and after watching SERUM, I came to the conclusion that based on the script, it had the potential to be mediocre at best but even failed to do that. This movie just stinks. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen and it had some decent moments in it, but it just failed on so many levels. I won't get into the low quality of the film, because it IS a low budget Indie horror film after all, and poor film quality usually comes with the territory. But there are some scenes that are so grainy that it makes the film look like it was made in the 80's. Also I'm curious as to how they cast this movie because most of the actors are terrible. Hickey did a good job as Dr. Kanopolus and even actor Derek Phillips did a pretty good job as the young Eddie, but for the most part the rest of the cast was terrible. However, all of the women in the film are super hot and we do get some obligatory nudity. My BIGGEST problem with the film was the directing and the editing. It's like there was absolutely no intention of making this film scary with how it was all presented. From the characters to the killer zombie to the gore, it was all just way too corny. Even the cheap scares aren't effective. And the ending is so dumb that it appropriately puts the final nail in the coffin of a movie that gets worse just when you think it COULDN'T.There are movies that are so bad that they're good and there are some movies that are just bad period. This is one of the movies that's just BAD. It's just a below average Medical Horror movie with no real entertaining moments, no scary moments, below average gore, and moments that attempt to be funny but end up failing. The verdict: Don't bother.1.5 stars",2,A weak attempt at a Medical/Zombie/Horror/Comedy.,1228694400,"12 8, 2008",2008,2359,"['SERUM', 'basically', 'doctor', 'named', 'Dr.', 'Eddie', 'Kanopolus', 'David', 'H.', 'Hickey', 'who', 'obsessed', 'developing', 'miracle', 'drug', 'can', 'cure', 'disease', 'When', 'funding', 'suddenly', 'jeopardized', 'nephew', 'hit', 'vehicle', 'coma', 'forced', 'do', 'something', 'drastic', 'find', 'final', 'ingredient', 'serum', 'brain', 'fluid', 'live', 'human', 'experiment', 'eventually', 'wrong', 'creating', 'zombie-like', 'creature', 'brain-eating', 'rampage', 'nearby', 'town', 'also', 'subplot', 'nephew', 'also', 'named', 'Eddie', 'girlfriend', 'making', 'amends', 'trying', 'patch', 'up', 'relationship', 'gone', 'bad.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'Medical', 'Horror', 'watching', 'SERUM', 'came', 'conclusion', 'based', 'script', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'mediocre', 'best', 'even', 'failed', 'do', 'movie', 'just', 'stinks', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'had', 'decent', 'moments', 'just', 'failed', 'many', 'levels', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'low', 'quality', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'Indie', 'horror', 'film', 'poor', 'film', 'quality', 'usually', 'territory', 'are', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'grainy', 'film', 'look', 'was', 'made', '80', 'Also', ""'m"", 'curious', 'how', 'cast', 'movie', 'most', 'actors', 'are', 'terrible', 'Hickey', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Dr.', 'Kanopolus', 'even', 'actor', 'Derek', 'Phillips', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'young', 'Eddie', 'most', 'part', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'terrible', 'However', 'women', 'film', 'are', 'super', 'hot', 'do', 'get', 'obligatory', 'nudity', 'BIGGEST', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'directing', 'editing', 'was', 'absolutely', 'intention', 'making', 'film', 'scary', 'how', 'was', 'presented', 'characters', 'killer', 'zombie', 'gore', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'corny', 'Even', 'cheap', 'scares', 'are', ""n't"", 'effective', 'ending', 'so', 'dumb', 'appropriately', 'final', 'nail', 'coffin', 'movie', 'worse', 'just', 'when', 'think', ""COULDN'T.There"", 'are', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'bad', ""'re"", 'good', 'are', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'bad', 'period', 'one', 'movies', 'just', 'BAD', 'just', 'below', 'average', 'Medical', 'Horror', 'movie', 'real', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'scary', 'moments', 'average', 'gore', 'moments', 'attempt', 'be', 'funny', 'end', 'up', 'failing', 'verdict', 'Do', ""n't"", 'bother.1.5', 'stars']",Serum

The film holds it's own against mainstream theatrical horror films such as ""SAW"", ""HOSTEL"" and the thematically similar ""DAWN OF THE DEAD.""  However, where these others may excel in graphic violence (not my favorite element), ""SERUM"" beats them with humor and plausibly absurd circumstances that catch the viewer by surprise while delivering an equal jolt of shock and comedy.

In SERUM, a mad doctor thinks he has developed a serum that will cure cancer; in actuality, it merely makes the subject puffy and homicidal, and oh yes, cannibalistic.  The good doctor decides that to make it work he needs live subjects rather than corpses.Woven into this plot is the story of handsome, nice young Eddie, the doctor's nephew, who has been accepted into medical school.  One night while walking home drunk from a club, he is struck by an automobile and near death.  Guess what the good uncle decides to do?Derek Phillips (from TV's FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS) has an honest likeability and does well; the rest of the cast is pretty weak.
