I was disappointed in the face I bought all the seasons of this series to find out some episodes are not on these dvds. I believe it has to to do with some of the actors on few shows would not sign off to be shown but that is my opinion I could be wrong. But the shows it has are still good ones but I miss a few like about Sweets grandfather where the bluesman sings a song about it. And a episode with Willie Gault  in it. Maybe later they come out with a special disc that has all the lost episodes I hope.,4,In the heat of the night,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,658,"['still', 'had', 'tv', 'hooked', 'satellite', 'cable', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'bought', 'cleared', 'bill', 'buy', 'dvds', 'watch', 'when', 'want', 'was', 'disappointed', 'face', 'bought', 'seasons', 'series', 'find', 'out', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'dvds', 'believe', 'do', 'actors', 'few', 'shows', 'would', 'not', 'sign', 'off', 'be', 'shown', 'opinion', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'shows', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'ones', 'miss', 'few', 'Sweets', 'where', 'bluesman', 'song', 'episode', 'Willie', 'Gault', 'Maybe', 'later', 'come', 'out', 'special', 'disc', 'lost', 'episodes', 'hope']",In The Heat of the Night Season 6
