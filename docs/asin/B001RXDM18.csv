1234515,A14COU5OWHU5RT,B001RXDM18,Allen,"[1, 3]","Very few films have ever been a hit when they go directly to DVD release, but ""Backwoods"" was a certified smash upon its release in 2008. The film features a bunch of young people going into the outback to do a paintball series, who go against each other in the woods. Eventually one by one these people are killed by crazed in-breeders living in isolation in the wilderness, kinda similar to ""Wrong Turn"" and ""Hills Have Eyes"" but the people in this movie are a big cult. The movie is pure escapist fun and if you love horror films ""Backwoods"" will satisfy your appetite for blood, guts, and gore. The movie is among one of the best I've seen and the acting was incredible, especially from Haylie Duff. 5/5",5,One of the BEST horror films I've seen in a long time,1274486400,"05 22, 2010",2010,707,"['Very', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'hit', 'when', 'go', 'directly', 'DVD', 'release', 'Backwoods', 'was', 'certified', 'smash', 'release', '2008', 'film', 'bunch', 'young', 'people', 'going', 'outback', 'do', 'paintball', 'series', 'who', 'go', 'other', 'woods', 'Eventually', 'one', 'one', 'people', 'are', 'killed', 'crazed', 'in-breeders', 'living', 'isolation', 'wilderness', 'kinda', 'similar', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'people', 'movie', 'are', 'big', 'cult', 'movie', 'pure', 'escapist', 'fun', 'love', 'horror', 'films', 'Backwoods', 'will', 'satisfy', 'appetite', 'blood', 'guts', 'gore', 'movie', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'acting', 'was', 'incredible', 'especially', 'Haylie', 'Duff', '5/5']",Backwoods

This was an entire compound of hicks gone homicidal in the woods, wanting to procreate. Must have ran out of farm animals. Since most of these movies are the same, what makes them worth watching is the acting. This one was a little different. For one thing it had that Howling 1 movie werewolf chick as the head of the hick family. With all of those relatives though, one of them could have bought her some Rogain though. One thing missing though was a good end-of-the-movie one-on-one fight for survival between the protagonist lead male or female and either the big hulking hick or the head hick ranger. You could have had both-the protagonist female fight against the Rogaine deficiant head antagonist female and the lead protagonist male fight against the two antagonist males.  The acting was good, as was the violence, although I would have pushed the neurotic screaming chick off the top of the cliff. She got on my nerves.The little differences in this movie, made it pretty good when compared to similar films. I am a huge fan of young unknowns in these types of films. Too many killers in such films  can dilute the concentration of the viewers, just as too many victims can. The ""survival in the woods"" theme is always a plus.

1234518,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B001RXDM18,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[31, 36]","I didn't have high expectations for this movie.  To my way of thinking, the world already has more than enough B-horror movies featuring a group of young people going out into the woods and being attacked by a bunch of dirty, disgusting backwoods cretins.  To make matters worse, the characters in this film are all taking part in a corporate team-building retreat (not a reunion - the information in the editorial review is less than accurate), a practice I consider to be one of the most infernal ideas mankind has ever come up with.  And wouldn't you know it?  These young video game company executives turn out to be among the most annoying people on the planet.  Only two have any redeeming qualities whatsoever, the one dude who isn't really in to all of the kissing up and debauched camaraderie (Ryan Merriman) and the hot girl who's sort of uncomfortable with her jerk boss's constant touchy-feely sessions with her (Haylie Duff).  To my surprise, the film actually grew some legs somewhere in the middle - but not enough to really win me over.  In the end, a complete lack of originality consigns Backwoods to the ranks of the slightly below average.  ThinkWrong TurnmeetsThe Hills Have Eyes, and you'll pretty much have Backwoods all figured out.I wasn't sure what to make of the name Tom Alan Smithee being given to a character (and a minor character, at that).  As most B-movie buffs know, ""Alan Smithee"" is the name film directors use when they know they've made a real stinker and don't want their real names associated with the project.  Maybe the character name is just a coincidence, but the fact that Smithee and his girlfriend turn up on Missing posters as having last been seen on February 30 seems to indicate that the script writer may have had a sense of humor about the whole thing.  (Unfortunately, these in-jokes are the only creative aspects of the entire film.)So our stereotypical characters all go out to the middle of nowhere to play paintball, hone their ""executive tactics,"" and have their teamwork skills reviewed by their obnoxious boss.  Being hot-shot executives and all, they happily set up camp in what they know is a restricted area that used to house some sort of military installation.  The one unhappy camper among them soon notices all of the obvious evidence that they're not alone, but no one wants to listen to his party pooping warnings.  The next thing you know, the gang is besieged by a group of religious fanatics who proceed to beat the crap out of the six guys while preparing the two females for use in increasing the local nutjob population.Backwoods was apparently produced for Spike TV, so don't expect to see much in the way of blood and gore.  (Needless to say, there's no nudity whatsoever.)  Some old-fashioned traps make the chase scenes through the forest somewhat interesting, but I pretty much relied on Haylie Duff's hotness to get me through the film's 80 minute runtime (although I must admit I got quite a kick out of watch a mortally wounded techie put on an amazing show of shooting bad guys without even aiming.)  If you're a horror fan, Backwoods is certainly a watchable film, but you won't see anything here you haven't seen before.",3,"Nothing you haven't seen before, but at least it is watchable",1245110400,"06 16, 2009",2009,3208,"['did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie', 'way', 'thinking', 'world', 'already', 'more', 'enough', 'B-horror', 'movies', 'featuring', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'going', 'woods', 'being', 'attacked', 'bunch', 'dirty', 'disgusting', 'backwoods', 'cretins', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'taking', 'part', 'corporate', 'team-building', 'retreat', 'not', 'reunion', 'information', 'editorial', 'review', 'less', 'accurate', 'practice', 'consider', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'infernal', 'ideas', 'mankind', 'ever', 'come', 'up', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'young', 'video', 'game', 'company', 'executives', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'most', 'annoying', 'people', 'planet', 'Only', 'two', 'have', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'whatsoever', 'one', 'dude', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'kissing', 'up', 'debauched', 'camaraderie', 'Ryan', 'Merriman', 'hot', 'girl', 'who', 'sort', 'uncomfortable', 'jerk', 'boss', 'constant', 'touchy-feely', 'sessions', 'Haylie', 'Duff', 'surprise', 'film', 'actually', 'grew', 'legs', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'not', 'enough', 'really', 'win', 'over', 'end', 'complete', 'lack', 'originality', 'consigns', 'Backwoods', 'ranks', 'slightly', 'below', 'average', 'ThinkWrong', 'TurnmeetsThe', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', ""'ll"", 'pretty', 'much', 'have', 'Backwoods', 'figured', 'out.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'name', 'Tom', 'Alan', 'Smithee', 'being', 'given', 'character', 'minor', 'character', 'most', 'B-movie', 'buffs', 'know', 'Alan', 'Smithee', 'name', 'film', 'directors', 'use', 'when', 'know', ""'ve"", 'made', 'real', 'stinker', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'real', 'names', 'associated', 'project', 'Maybe', 'character', 'name', 'just', 'coincidence', 'fact', 'Smithee', 'girlfriend', 'turn', 'up', 'Missing', 'posters', 'having', 'last', 'been', 'seen', 'February', '30', 'indicate', 'script', 'writer', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'sense', 'humor', 'whole', 'thing', 'Unfortunately', 'in-jokes', 'are', 'only', 'creative', 'aspects', 'entire', 'film', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'go', 'out', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'play', 'paintball', 'hone', 'executive', 'tactics', 'have', 'teamwork', 'skills', 'reviewed', 'obnoxious', 'boss', 'Being', 'hot-shot', 'executives', 'happily', 'set', 'up', 'camp', 'what', 'know', 'restricted', 'area', 'used', 'house', 'sort', 'military', 'installation', 'one', 'unhappy', 'camper', 'soon', 'obvious', 'evidence', ""'re"", 'not', 'alone', 'one', 'listen', 'party', 'pooping', 'warnings', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'gang', 'besieged', 'group', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'who', 'proceed', 'beat', 'crap', 'six', 'guys', 'preparing', 'two', 'females', 'use', 'increasing', 'local', 'nutjob', 'population.Backwoods', 'was', 'apparently', 'produced', 'Spike', 'TV', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'much', 'way', 'blood', 'gore', 'Needless', 'say', 'nudity', 'whatsoever', 'old-fashioned', 'traps', 'make', 'chase', 'forest', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'pretty', 'much', 'relied', 'Haylie', 'Duff', 'hotness', 'get', 'film', '80', 'minute', 'runtime', 'must', 'admit', 'got', 'quite', 'kick', 'watch', 'mortally', 'wounded', 'techie', 'put', 'amazing', 'show', 'shooting', 'bad', 'guys', 'even', 'aiming', ""'re"", 'horror', 'fan', 'Backwoods', 'certainly', 'watchable', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before']",Backwoods

I figured on a rainy day when nothing's on, why not watch another gory movie about what we've all seen a thousand times before just to pass the time. I was actually very surprised at how good this movie actually is.Finally, we have a decent reason for ppl being out in the woods instead of them just randomly deciding to go there or the usual running out of gas. And finally there's an actual legitimate story behind why the ppl are crazy in the first place. The group is a bunch of young business ppl who go on a paintball retreat for the weekend in what they think is some kind of National Park. The ppl that live in this area are still stuck in some kind of time warp where they believe the government is out to do them harm.One of the guys walks around with a hat on that says FBI so the ppl that live there think that's who the group is. It's not long before they start their next day to do their paintball thing when they realize strange things happening around them. They soon realize something's not right and decide to leave. That's when everything starts happening.However, the ""backwoods"" ppl aren't running around randomly trying to kill everybody just because they can. They don't want to harm the women. There's sort of a 'Mother Earth' figure who leads things and believes the women need to be part of their circle to breed. I won't say much more and give it all away but finally a good backwoods story that has meaning for the ppl being there and meaning for why they're being targets.It's actually a really good movie, good acting, good storyline, and everything comes together when it should.

1234534,A2M8CILGD2NNPI,B001RXDM18,"Steven Yates ""free your mind""","[4, 6]","I had this on in the background on SyFy while I was doing other things, paused to watch for a while. I think I've seen this same movie maybe a dozen times now. A couple of weeks ago, it was called ""Timber Falls"" or something like that. The plot is simple: a group of rather uninspiring yuppie types goes camping or on some kind of retreat (details change slightly from movie to movie), run into a group of violent, backward wackos who just happen to wear their religious fundamentalism on their sleeves. The yuppie men are beaten and tortured; the women are dressed in skimpy dresses and sexually assaulted, to be bred to make more wackos--with the ""stud"" usually a long-haired knuckle-dragger who can't even speak past the occasional grunt. Through their innate stupidity one of the wackos screws up and drops his guard; the yuppies pick him off and escape. Alarms sound; a chase ensues. One of the yuppies is able, usually through the most credibility-destroying means the writers can dream up, to pick off the pursuing wackos. In the case of this movie, the most vengeful yuppie has stepped into a trap and gotten himself impaled on a pair of wooden spikes. He is nevertheless able to raise his rifle, aim, & drop several pursuing cultists with one shot each. The whole sequence is laughably idiotic.What struck me as I was watching was the following: how many times now have we seen rural, religious people depicted as violent, bloodthirsty psychotics who have to all intents & purposes left the civilized world (or were never part of it to begin with)? Can this possibly be a 'good thing'? Most country people, in my experience, are more decent than most city people--or at least will be decent to you if you are decent to them. If you're simply interested in a decent horror film, does the word 'stereotype' ring any bells?Think this is just entertainment? Don't kid yourself. The Hollywood lefties who dream up this crap have an agenda. I have to wonder if they really think they are doing society any favors. What they are doing is watering the fruits of further social division, setting groups and classes against each other when what we should be doing is coming together.",1,Stupid film with stupid characters for stupid people ...,1277596800,"06 27, 2010",2010,2182,"['had', 'background', 'SyFy', 'was', 'doing', 'other', 'things', 'paused', 'watch', 'while', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'same', 'movie', 'maybe', 'dozen', 'times', 'now', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'was', 'called', 'Timber', 'Falls', 'something', 'plot', 'simple', 'group', 'rather', 'uninspiring', 'types', 'camping', 'kind', 'retreat', 'details', 'change', 'slightly', 'movie', 'movie', 'run', 'group', 'violent', 'backward', 'wackos', 'who', 'just', 'happen', 'wear', 'religious', 'fundamentalism', 'sleeves', 'yuppie', 'men', 'are', 'beaten', 'tortured', 'women', 'are', 'dressed', 'skimpy', 'dresses', 'sexually', 'assaulted', 'be', 'bred', 'make', 'more', 'wackos', 'stud', 'usually', 'long-haired', 'knuckle-dragger', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'speak', 'occasional', 'grunt', 'innate', 'stupidity', 'one', 'wackos', 'up', 'drops', 'guard', 'yuppies', 'pick', 'off', 'escape', 'Alarms', 'sound', 'chase', 'One', 'yuppies', 'able', 'usually', 'most', 'credibility-destroying', 'writers', 'can', 'dream', 'up', 'pick', 'off', 'pursuing', 'wackos', 'case', 'movie', 'most', 'vengeful', 'yuppie', 'stepped', 'trap', 'gotten', 'impaled', 'pair', 'wooden', 'spikes', 'nevertheless', 'able', 'raise', 'rifle', 'aim', 'drop', 'several', 'pursuing', 'cultists', 'one', 'shot', 'whole', 'sequence', 'laughably', 'idiotic.What', 'struck', 'was', 'watching', 'was', 'following', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'now', 'have', 'seen', 'rural', 'religious', 'people', 'depicted', 'violent', 'bloodthirsty', 'psychotics', 'who', 'have', 'intents', 'purposes', 'left', 'civilized', 'world', 'were', 'never', 'part', 'begin', 'Can', 'possibly', 'be', ""'good"", 'thing', 'Most', 'country', 'people', 'experience', 'are', 'more', 'decent', 'most', 'city', 'people', 'least', 'will', 'be', 'decent', 'are', 'decent', ""'re"", 'simply', 'interested', 'decent', 'horror', 'film', 'word', 'ring', 'bells', 'Think', 'just', 'entertainment', 'Do', ""n't"", 'kid', 'Hollywood', 'lefties', 'who', 'dream', 'up', 'crap', 'have', 'agenda', 'have', 'wonder', 'really', 'think', 'are', 'doing', 'society', 'favors', 'What', 'are', 'doing', 'watering', 'fruits', 'further', 'social', 'division', 'setting', 'groups', 'classes', 'other', 'when', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'coming', 'together']",Backwoods

1234536,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B001RXDM18,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","I suspect that many people didn't even make it past the first half hour of Backwoods, but thankfully the film does get somewhat better after that. The story begins very simply, with a group of computer geeks going on a corporate retreat in the woods. In typical horror movie fashion, they get lost on the way and ask for directions at a gas station. The man behind the counter, directs them to a closer and even better spot in the middle of nowhere and the games begin. Ultimately, the group stumbles on a fanatical religious cult, who mistake the group for FBI agents, because of course all FBI agents are out of shape, twenty-something, computer geeks, carrying paintball guns. From there it's a fight for survival and a race to escape the backwoods of Northern California. While the film does get better after the first half hour, it still has its problems. For starters, the story is far too unbelievable, no one would take advice from someone at the gas station who looked like that and even rednecks in the middle of nowhere aren't going to mistake a bunch of geeks playing paintball for FBI agents. As with most horror films, the cast is lead by two extremely good looking people, Ryan Merriman and Haylie Duff, who both give unexpected performances. Merriman is know for his fiery and inspirational roles in sports films and he should most definitely stick to those. He was way out of his league here, giving a really ridiculous and unbelievable portrayal. Merriman's done horror before, and even starred in one of the Final Destination movies, but he's clearly not right for this type of film. Haylie Duff on the other hand was terrific! She has really turned into a pretty good actress and is absolutely beautiful. Backwoods would not be my first choice for a horror film festival, even for it's genre it is unbelievable and assumes it's audience will be too dumb to pick up on it. The performances vary and the sequence is somewhat expected, although I did enjoy the ending. The verdict, Backwoods isn't terrible, but it's far from special, I'd only rent it if I liked one of the cast members or was a big fan of the genre.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,2134,"['suspect', 'many', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'first', 'hour', 'Backwoods', 'thankfully', 'film', 'get', 'somewhat', 'better', 'story', 'very', 'simply', 'group', 'computer', 'geeks', 'going', 'corporate', 'retreat', 'woods', 'typical', 'horror', 'movie', 'fashion', 'get', 'lost', 'way', 'ask', 'directions', 'gas', 'station', 'man', 'counter', 'closer', 'even', 'better', 'spot', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'games', 'begin', 'Ultimately', 'group', 'fanatical', 'religious', 'cult', 'who', 'mistake', 'group', 'FBI', 'agents', 'course', 'FBI', 'agents', 'are', 'shape', 'twenty-something', 'computer', 'geeks', 'carrying', 'paintball', 'guns', 'fight', 'survival', 'race', 'escape', 'backwoods', 'Northern', 'California', 'film', 'get', 'better', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'still', 'problems', 'starters', 'story', 'far', 'too', 'unbelievable', 'one', 'would', 'take', 'advice', 'someone', 'gas', 'station', 'who', 'looked', 'even', 'rednecks', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'mistake', 'bunch', 'geeks', 'playing', 'paintball', 'FBI', 'agents', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'cast', 'lead', 'two', 'extremely', 'good', 'looking', 'people', 'Ryan', 'Merriman', 'Haylie', 'Duff', 'who', 'give', 'unexpected', 'performances', 'Merriman', 'know', 'fiery', 'inspirational', 'roles', 'sports', 'films', 'should', 'most', 'definitely', 'stick', 'was', 'way', 'league', 'here', 'giving', 'really', 'ridiculous', 'unbelievable', 'portrayal', 'Merriman', 'done', 'horror', 'even', 'starred', 'one', 'Final', 'Destination', 'movies', 'clearly', 'not', 'right', 'type', 'film', 'Haylie', 'Duff', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'terrific', 'really', 'turned', 'pretty', 'good', 'actress', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'Backwoods', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'first', 'choice', 'horror', 'film', 'festival', 'even', 'genre', 'unbelievable', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'dumb', 'pick', 'up', 'performances', 'vary', 'sequence', 'somewhat', 'expected', 'did', 'enjoy', 'ending', 'verdict', 'Backwoods', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'far', 'special', ""'d"", 'only', 'rent', 'liked', 'one', 'cast', 'members', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'genre']",Backwoods
1234537,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001RXDM18,trebe,"[1, 1]","Backwoods (2008) is another film where folks from the city, run into trouble while camping out in the wilderness.  As a made for TV feature, things are toned down accordingly.  For a film in this genre, Backwoods is not particularly original or well done, and is rather annoying at times, but it does provide a few thrills and laughs.As part of a job evaluation, the executive staff of a computer gaming company is divided into two teams, for a paintball battle in the forest.  The two groups drive out into the backwoods of North Carolina, and setup separate camp sites.  The next day, the war game begins, but while out hunting each other, the paintballers are attacked and captured, by members of a religious cult living in the woods, and dragged back to their camp.Deborah van Valkenburg (Too Close For Comfort) is the matriarch of the forest clan.  She determines if female prisoners are suitable for `breeding', with her ugly hulk of a son, Josiah (Robert `Bonecrusher' Mukes).  The forest people are engaged in the manufacturer of illegal drugs, and fear the attention of law enforcement.  Believing that the outsiders are FBI agents, the male prisoners are beaten, and tortured.Killing some of their captors, the surviving male prisoners, led by Perry (Danny Nucci) and Adam (Ryan Merriman), manage to get free and do some damage.  Making a break, they are able to free their companions, Lee (Haylie Duff) and Maggie (Mimi Michaels), and flee into the woods, with the clan close behind.  The film's most memorable instance of graphic violence, involving a trap with sharpened wooden spikes, is also one of the most humorous.  It is amazing how well someone can shoot, when impaled on a set of spikes.The writing is not great, particularly the dialog.  Many of the victims are not too bright, or very likeable.  Story development is not a strong point, and the ending is pretty weak.  There is some decent use of outdoor locations, and a couple of nasty kills, but nothing that really distinguishes the film from others in the genre.  While perhaps pushing the edge for a TV movie, this film isn't in the same extreme category as some feature films.  If your taste in horror runs along the lines of a diluted, dumbed-down version of `Wrong Turn', you might want to give this a try.",2,"a corporate retreat with some annoying paintballers, turns nasty . . .",1272672000,"05 1, 2010",2010,2288,"['Backwoods', '2008', 'film', 'where', 'folks', 'city', 'run', 'trouble', 'camping', 'out', 'wilderness', 'made', 'TV', 'feature', 'things', 'are', 'toned', 'down', 'accordingly', 'film', 'genre', 'Backwoods', 'not', 'particularly', 'original', 'well', 'done', 'rather', 'annoying', 'times', 'provide', 'few', 'thrills', 'laughs.As', 'part', 'job', 'evaluation', 'executive', 'staff', 'computer', 'gaming', 'company', 'divided', 'two', 'teams', 'paintball', 'battle', 'forest', 'two', 'groups', 'drive', 'out', 'backwoods', 'North', 'Carolina', 'setup', 'separate', 'camp', 'sites', 'next', 'day', 'war', 'game', 'out', 'hunting', 'other', 'paintballers', 'are', 'attacked', 'captured', 'members', 'religious', 'cult', 'living', 'woods', 'dragged', 'back', 'camp.Deborah', 'van', 'Valkenburg', 'Too', 'Close', 'Comfort', 'matriarch', 'forest', 'clan', 'female', 'prisoners', 'are', 'suitable', 'breeding', 'ugly', 'hulk', 'son', 'Josiah', 'Robert', 'Bonecrusher', 'Mukes', 'forest', 'people', 'are', 'engaged', 'manufacturer', 'illegal', 'drugs', 'fear', 'attention', 'law', 'enforcement', 'Believing', 'outsiders', 'are', 'FBI', 'agents', 'male', 'prisoners', 'are', 'beaten', 'tortured.Killing', 'captors', 'surviving', 'male', 'prisoners', 'led', 'Perry', 'Danny', 'Nucci', 'Adam', 'Ryan', 'Merriman', 'manage', 'get', 'free', 'do', 'damage', 'Making', 'break', 'are', 'able', 'free', 'companions', 'Lee', 'Haylie', 'Duff', 'Maggie', 'Mimi', 'Michaels', 'flee', 'woods', 'clan', 'close', 'film', 'most', 'memorable', 'instance', 'graphic', 'violence', 'involving', 'trap', 'sharpened', 'wooden', 'spikes', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'humorous', 'amazing', 'how', 'well', 'someone', 'can', 'shoot', 'when', 'impaled', 'set', 'spikes.The', 'writing', 'not', 'great', 'particularly', 'dialog', 'Many', 'victims', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'bright', 'very', 'likeable', 'Story', 'development', 'not', 'strong', 'point', 'ending', 'pretty', 'weak', 'decent', 'use', 'outdoor', 'locations', 'couple', 'nasty', 'kills', 'nothing', 'really', 'film', 'others', 'genre', 'perhaps', 'pushing', 'edge', 'TV', 'movie', 'film', ""n't"", 'same', 'extreme', 'category', 'feature', 'films', 'taste', 'horror', 'runs', 'lines', 'diluted', 'dumbed-down', 'version', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'might', 'want', 'give', 'try']",Backwoods
