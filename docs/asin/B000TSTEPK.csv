This is our current all-time favorite show, and we watch the episodes over and over.  The third series is every bit as good as the previous two, and doesn't get maudlin at the end.  I love the lack of sentimentality, the constancy of the characters.  Simon Pegg is a brilliant guest star.  The only thing that's missing is the commentary, which on the first two discs is like getting double the number of episodes.  When the complete box set with third season commentary comes out, I'll be at the front of the line.

1092138,A2KSMCH46TL9QF,B000TSTEPK,"Lisa Herbertson ""Author of 'Swimming Along'""","[1, 1]","I believe season three is actually better than season two. The plots are fantastic in this series, and I love the episode when Manny's parents come to stay. My friends are such fans of the show, that they now call the grandparents of their newly born son ""moo ma"" and ""moo pa"" ... makes me laugh every time.

1092139,A13IKSGDYNBNQS,B000TSTEPK,S J Buck,"[13, 13]","This third series is as good the first two series if not better.The opening episode is one of the best of all. A competitor bookshop 'Goliath Books' has opened next door and Manny (Bill Bailey) is now working there. He left 'Black Books' after his hand was burnt by Bernard. Simon Pegg plays the Manager of Goliath books and really adds another dimension to the show. Shame he couldn't have done more. This episode is absolutely brilliant and I must have watched 8 or 9 time now.The episode 'Moo-Ma and Moo-Pa' contains perhaps the most surreal moment of the entire series when Bernard and Fran go a under a dinner table in a restaurant to pick up a piece of cutlery and there is a whole bar under the table! In case you hadn't worked it out Moo-Ma and Moo-Pa are Manny's parents who come down to visit, much to Bernards disgust.Sadly there is no commentary on the series 3 disc. The commentaries on series 1 & 2 were almost as good as the shows themselves. However the out-takes and deleted scenes are good, and as whole the DVD easily merits 5 stars.",5,Sublime Comedy,1189728000,"09 14, 2007",2007,1052,"['third', 'series', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'not', 'better.The', 'opening', 'episode', 'one', 'best', 'competitor', 'bookshop', 'Books', 'opened', 'next', 'door', 'Manny', 'Bill', 'Bailey', 'now', 'working', 'there', 'left', ""'Black"", 'Books', 'hand', 'was', 'burnt', 'Bernard', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Manager', 'Goliath', 'books', 'really', 'dimension', 'show', 'Shame', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'more', 'episode', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'must', 'have', 'watched', '8', '9', 'time', 'now.The', 'episode', ""'Moo-Ma"", 'Moo-Pa', 'contains', 'perhaps', 'most', 'surreal', 'moment', 'entire', 'series', 'when', 'Bernard', 'Fran', 'go', 'dinner', 'table', 'restaurant', 'pick', 'up', 'piece', 'cutlery', 'whole', 'bar', 'table', 'case', 'had', ""n't"", 'worked', 'Moo-Ma', 'Moo-Pa', 'are', 'Manny', 'parents', 'who', 'come', 'down', 'visit', 'much', 'Bernards', 'disgust.Sadly', 'commentary', 'series', '3', 'disc', 'commentaries', 'series', '1', '2', 'were', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'shows', 'However', 'out-takes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'good', 'whole', 'DVD', 'easily', '5', 'stars']",Black Books: The Complete Third Series
1092140,A1YR0NF8OZIA0A,B000TSTEPK,S. Meador,"[3, 3]","Black Books 3 is as deliciously funny as the first two seasons. Bernard Black, Fran and Manny are back and they're the same anti-social, insane and bumbling trio we adore from the first seasons. Dylan portrays Bernard Black; a wine-guzzling, cigarette smoking, Irishman, and he plays it so well. All of his mannerisms are hilarious and you never know what he's going to do next. He's definitely my favorite character. I only wish their seasons were longer. Each season has 6 episodes that will still keep you laughing even after you've watched them for the third or fourth time. I know some people just don't get British humor, but this show is entertaining for anyone looking for humor, wit, and a some good old fashioned physical comedy. If you've never seen it, I recommend you see it from the beginning. The first episode of the first season is one of my all-time favorites. And in this third season, my favorite episode would have to be Elephants and Hens in which Bernard and Manny have bet Fran that they can write a children's book in one night and they have another bet that Fran will have an awful time with her friends that same night. Black Books is one of my favorite shows and everyone I've played it for has loved it too.",5,One of the best British shows!,1219968000,"08 29, 2008",2008,1236,"['Black', 'Books', '3', 'as', 'deliciously', 'funny', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Bernard', 'Black', 'Fran', 'Manny', 'are', 'back', ""'re"", 'same', 'anti-social', 'insane', 'bumbling', 'trio', 'adore', 'first', 'seasons', 'Dylan', 'Bernard', 'Black', 'wine-guzzling', 'cigarette', 'smoking', 'Irishman', 'so', 'well', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'hilarious', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'next', 'definitely', 'favorite', 'character', 'only', 'wish', 'seasons', 'were', 'longer', 'season', '6', 'episodes', 'will', 'still', 'keep', 'laughing', 'even', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'third', 'fourth', 'time', 'know', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'British', 'humor', 'show', 'entertaining', 'anyone', 'looking', 'humor', 'wit', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'physical', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'recommend', 'see', 'beginning', 'first', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'third', 'season', 'favorite', 'episode', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Elephants', 'Hens', 'Bernard', 'Manny', 'have', 'bet', 'Fran', 'can', 'write', 'children', 'book', 'one', 'night', 'have', 'bet', 'Fran', 'will', 'have', 'awful', 'time', 'friends', 'same', 'night', 'Black', 'Books', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'everyone', ""'ve"", 'played', 'loved', 'too']",Black Books: The Complete Third Series
