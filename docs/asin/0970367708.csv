167433,A2K7CVIVEWDOVN,0970367708,brian tunick,"[1, 1]","Almost ten years ago, I saw this movie on a first date.  The relationship went sour, and I never did find out anything else about the film, who created it, how it was made, how to get a copy, etc.  Yesterday, while downloading de-motivational pictures for office decoration purposes, I noticed it for sale in DVD format, along with countless hours of footage on the making, the meaning(s), the reception, and everything else to do with this brilliant example of stop-motion film.The work itself is short.  In that way, it is similar to Kafka's Metamorphosis.  Six minutes of film that could not be correctly analyzed in six months.  Although there are a few obvious themes (depersonalization, assembly-line/minimalistic/capital-driven grey future, etc.), a lot is left to personal interpretation.  For example, many reviewers seem to find the main character to be an `old' inventor, which I don't see.  I personally see him as somewhere 10-15 years into a thankless and unfulfilling profession.  Not too far removed from those dreams of childhood.  Those memories (in my opinion) are made even more painful because of their relative recent happening.  This coupled with the fact that the past is just that, and no amount of fame, fortune, success can bring it back - quite the contrary, makes for an extremely emotional experience.  Then again...  Maybe I've got a bit more in common with him than I would like to admit.The most striking thing to me is the different interpretation I had back in the late 90's.  Vastly different time in my life, vastly different experience.  Back then, I just saw it as `money isn't everything', coupled with an absurd dream that could never actually happen.  I am no art teacher, but I would say a six-minute film with two dynamic emotional responses (both of which involved some involuntary tearing) is art.  Fine art, at that.It is altogether possible as an early twenty-something, I was a bit less jaded than I am as an early thirty-something, but this just seems somehow `realer' than the things being produced today.  Hopefully more people will be bored, hanging de-motivational posters and (re)discover ""More"".  There is an important lesson, and the film allows us to experience it rather than just learn it.",5,Should Be Required Viewing For All Corporate Soldiers,1177545600,"04 26, 2007",2007,2249,"['Almost', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'date', 'relationship', 'went', 'sour', 'never', 'did', 'find', 'out', 'anything', 'else', 'film', 'who', 'created', 'how', 'was', 'made', 'how', 'get', 'copy', 'etc', 'Yesterday', 'downloading', 'de-motivational', 'pictures', 'office', 'decoration', 'purposes', 'noticed', 'sale', 'DVD', 'format', 'countless', 'hours', 'footage', 'making', 'meaning', 's', 'reception', 'everything', 'else', 'do', 'brilliant', 'example', 'stop-motion', 'film.The', 'work', 'short', 'way', 'similar', 'Kafka', 'Metamorphosis', 'Six', 'minutes', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'correctly', 'analyzed', 'six', 'months', 'are', 'few', 'obvious', 'themes', 'depersonalization', 'assembly-line/minimalistic/capital-driven', 'grey', 'future', 'etc', 'lot', 'left', 'personal', 'interpretation', 'example', 'many', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'find', 'main', 'character', 'be', 'old', 'inventor', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'personally', 'see', 'somewhere', '10-15', 'years', 'thankless', 'unfulfilling', 'profession', 'Not', 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'dreams', 'childhood', 'memories', 'opinion', 'are', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'painful', 'relative', 'recent', 'happening', 'coupled', 'fact', 'past', 'just', 'amount', 'fame', 'fortune', 'success', 'can', 'bring', 'back', 'contrary', 'extremely', 'emotional', 'experience', 'Then', 'again', 'Maybe', ""'ve"", 'got', 'bit', 'more', 'common', 'would', 'like', 'admit.The', 'most', 'striking', 'thing', 'different', 'interpretation', 'had', 'back', 'late', '90', 'Vastly', 'different', 'time', 'life', 'vastly', 'different', 'experience', 'Back', 'then', 'just', 'saw', 'money', ""n't"", 'everything', 'coupled', 'absurd', 'dream', 'could', 'never', 'actually', 'happen', 'am', 'art', 'teacher', 'would', 'say', 'six-minute', 'film', 'two', 'dynamic', 'emotional', 'responses', 'involved', 'involuntary', 'tearing', 'art', 'Fine', 'art', 'that.It', 'altogether', 'possible', 'early', 'twenty-something', 'was', 'bit', 'less', 'jaded', 'am', 'early', 'thirty-something', 'just', 'somehow', 'realer', 'things', 'being', 'produced', 'today', 'Hopefully', 'more', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'bored', 'hanging', 'de-motivational', 'posters', 're', 'More', 'important', 'lesson', 'film', 'experience', 'rather', 'just', 'learn']",N/A

167435,A1JDDX70A0XUFO,0970367708,shivatrance,"[6, 6]","Not to sound like Neo but. . . .Whoa.Simply put: a tremendous film with a great message.  This six-minute short is an angry little film and has quite a lot to say.I first saw this film on the Sci-fi channel's show EXPOSURE, a series which focuses on short films from up and coming directors.  I was tuning in to this particular episode only for the fact that they were going to show Tim Burton's first ever film he made, &quot;Vincent.&quot;  While yes, I thought that Burton's film was outstanding (of course, how can it not be?) I was reluctant to watch the rest of the show since I have seen A LOT of bad shorts on this show.  I am so glad that I stayed tuned in to EXPOSURE that night.From the first moment of this film until the haunting end, I was emotionally drawn in to the character's world and his thoughts.  This film speaks to us about our dreams and our aspirations; the things that make us go on: hope, happiness, success and pride.  Feeling that you have accomplished something.Remember when you were young and everything seemed possible.  You may have had one dream that seemed dearer to you than all of your others combined.  One dream that made you work harder, made you excited about life. . . .well what would you do if you acheived your dream?Well, what then?. . . what then?Would life still have that zing to it?  Would you still have the fire burning within you?I have to admit to this: I have seen this film over 25 times and everytime I see it, tears come to my eyes.  Mark Osborne is a genius and he proves that a lot can be said without using any words.

167436,A33HTLHKZ4JSK5,0970367708,T. Austin,"[0, 1]","Predominately stop motion animatoion, the film can be best described as mixed media animation utilizing both computer and cell anmation in places. the art direction is superb, character design was very clever.  The production design is a cross beteen Fritz Lang's metropolis and a 1950's version of New York.  The soundtrack; which I really liked even though jazz is my genre, was a &quot;new age&quot; blues fusion.  It worked very, very, well in resonating the mood of the film.Story-wise it is very strong.  I found it coherent, focused, and I thoroughly enjoyed the allogorical themes. Such as the metaphore used to describe the dreams within one's soul or call it the &quot;fire within one's belly&quot;.  Whatever,  it was a home runThe short is about an assembly-line welder with dreams.  Dreams of  becoming an inventor who makes a diffference. Dreams of happiness and freedom.  The kind of freedom and happiness a child has.  I don't want to give it away, but when I finished the film, I wondered if this is the way Bill Gates now feels.  And maybe this explains why he is giving away all his money.Tony",5,This movie is fine art,1013904000,"02 17, 2002",2002,1112,"['Predominately', 'stop', 'motion', 'animatoion', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'described', 'mixed', 'media', 'animation', 'utilizing', 'computer', 'cell', 'anmation', 'places', 'art', 'direction', 'superb', 'character', 'design', 'was', 'very', 'clever', 'production', 'design', 'cross', 'beteen', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'metropolis', '1950', 'version', 'New', 'York', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'liked', 'even', 'jazz', 'genre', 'was', 'quot', 'new', 'age', 'quot', 'blues', 'fusion', 'worked', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'resonating', 'mood', 'film.Story-wise', 'very', 'strong', 'found', 'coherent', 'focused', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'allogorical', 'themes', 'Such', 'metaphore', 'used', 'describe', 'dreams', 'one', 'soul', 'call', 'quot', 'fire', 'one', 'belly', 'quot', 'was', 'home', 'runThe', 'short', 'assembly-line', 'welder', 'dreams', 'Dreams', 'becoming', 'inventor', 'who', 'diffference', 'Dreams', 'happiness', 'freedom', 'kind', 'freedom', 'happiness', 'child', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'when', 'finished', 'film', 'wondered', 'way', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'now', 'maybe', 'why', 'giving', 'away', 'money.Tony']",N/A
