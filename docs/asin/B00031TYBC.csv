The characters reached their high point of development here. Some did not survive it. Sure, there was a rediculious plot or 2, but all in all this FLOORS season 3 (which i found to be a liiitttllee bland.) 2 more to go and I'll have to complete set! I was very pleased that HBO let me have 16 Episodes for the price i'd been paying for 8! It was quite kind of them. Now how about geting season 5 and 6 out before 2006?!

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[0, 2]","Perhaps it is because there are so many more episodes in the fourth season of Oz that more hell breaks loose; but break loose it does. Tension rises between the Muslims and Aryans; Keller and Beecher cannot seem to get their relationship on an even keel; good cops turn bad; a woman is executed by hanging. The list goes on. Actually most of the people on death row don't get a chance to be executed. One is killed while in his cell; another, a prisoner in full drag as Susan Hayward, dies on the eve of his execution; and another is killed as he tries to escape on his way to a hospital supposedly to donate his organs.Mr. Fontana teases the audience by giving two possibilities on whether Beecher gets paroled. For that he should have to watch 40 hours of commercial television. Additionally he, along with Lee Tergesen (Beecher) and Dean Winters (Ryan O'Reily), gives a running commentary to the last hour of this year's episodes. It consists mostly of inane comments and crude jokes in addition to Mr. Fontana's remark-- I believe it was his voice-- indicating that most of Oz viewers wouldn't know the meaning of the  word ""apoplexy."" While this ""commentary"" takes nothing away from the episodes, it certainly adds nothing either. To paraphrase a former First Lady, when you are asked if you want to view the final episode with commentary, just say ""no.""",5,Something For Everyone,1161734400,"10 25, 2006",2006,1359,"['Perhaps', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'episodes', 'fourth', 'season', 'Oz', 'more', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'break', 'loose', 'Tension', 'Muslims', 'Aryans', 'Keller', 'Beecher', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'get', 'relationship', 'even', 'keel', 'good', 'cops', 'turn', 'bad', 'woman', 'executed', 'hanging', 'list', 'Actually', 'most', 'people', 'death', 'row', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'be', 'executed', 'One', 'killed', 'cell', 'prisoner', 'full', 'drag', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'eve', 'execution', 'killed', 'escape', 'way', 'hospital', 'supposedly', 'donate', 'organs.Mr', 'Fontana', 'audience', 'giving', 'two', 'possibilities', 'Beecher', 'paroled', 'should', 'have', 'watch', '40', 'hours', 'commercial', 'television', 'Additionally', 'Lee', 'Tergesen', 'Beecher', 'Dean', 'Winters', 'Ryan', ""O'Reily"", 'running', 'commentary', 'last', 'hour', 'year', 'episodes', 'mostly', 'inane', 'comments', 'crude', 'jokes', 'addition', 'Mr.', 'Fontana', 'remark', 'believe', 'was', 'voice', 'indicating', 'most', 'Oz', 'viewers', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'meaning', 'word', 'apoplexy', 'commentary', 'nothing', 'away', 'episodes', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'either', 'paraphrase', 'former', 'First', 'Lady', 'when', 'are', 'asked', 'want', 'view', 'final', 'episode', 'commentary', 'just', 'say']",N/A

854576,A3T9IX8EDFDX4G,B00031TYBC,John Alapick,"[1, 1]","In Season 4, Oz pulled out all the stops. It was their only 16 episode season with the first half airing in the summer of 2000 and the second half airing in the winter of 2001. The first half was Oz at its absolute best and I would give it 6 stars if possible. Every episode ended in a cliffhanger. As for pulling out all the stops, all of the following happened in the first 8 episodes: A mass prison shooting, a prison escape, a firing and rehiring of the head of Emerald City, the eldest prisoner becoming a killer again, an undercover cop entering the prison to stop the drug trade only to become a junkie himself, a rape, a revenge completed for said rape, an attempted assassination, and the drug trade leader and arguably most interesting character of Oz meeting his demise. In addition to all of this, the Beecher-Schillinger feud continued to escalate. What you see a lot during this season the prisoners playing with the hacks to their benefit. The season's second half is not quite as good but still very intriguing with new characters Jeremiah Cloutier, Burr Redding, Supreme Allah, and Clayton Hughes all playing strong roles. The Augustus Hill character expands beyond narrator, Robson becomes the show's ultimate p***k, Ryan O'Reily is still super slick, and a basketball tournament leads to more violence between the prisoners and the CO's. The episode where a documentary was being filmed about Oz was also top notch. There are a couple of unrealistic storylines such as the aging drug and Busmalis nearly marrying someone half his age. The season ended strong with two twists regarding Beecher's parole and a bomb. All told, this is the best season of Oz and the last great one.

854581,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00031TYBC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[18, 22]","There is a point in the final episode of ""Oz: The Complete Fourth Season"" where EM City Administrator Tim McManus (Terry Kinney) informs an inmate who is in fear for his life that there is no room in either protective custody or solitary confinement to put him.  That certainly makes sense given the high body count during this season.  Was it the highest body count ever for ""Oz""?  I have not been keeping a tally to this point, but it sure seemed like it was.  After all, this was a season where most of the inmates on death row who died were not actually executed by the state.  It is a good thing for Warden Leo Glenn (Ernie Hudson) that Governor James Devlin (Zeljko Ivanek) is running for re-election, because it helps to have a boss who thinks inmates killing inmates is, to put it delicately, not a bad thing.The main dynamic for the fourth season ends up being between Simon Adebisi (Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje) and Kareem Said (Eamonn Walker).  From the beginning of ""Oz"" it was Said who has been the voice of reason, and it was Abedisi who personified the impulse towards anarchy at the Oswald Correctional Facility.  After Khan's death, and because of Said's visits from Tricia Ross, Zahir Arif (Granville Adams) moves to take over the leadership of the Muslims.  While Said is cast adrift in the hierarchy of Emerald City, Adebisi achieves his objective and actually masterminds the removal of McManus as the administrator of Oz.  Of course, Abedisi's success contains the seeds of his own destruction because that is the way things go in the merry old land of Oz.  Meanwhile, Said finds out that Oz makes men do things they never thought they would do and changes them in ways they would not want to be changed.For me, and I suspect many, Tobias Beecher (Lee Tergesen) is the inmate we most identify with on ""Oz.""  Beecher is the ""regular"" guy who ends up in prison and is fresh meat for the inmates, and the fact that he has survived this far does not in any way, shape or form convince me that I would be able to do half as well.  But Beecher has survived, and in this season his ongoing conflict with Vern Schillinger (J.K. Simmons) turns even deadlier than it has been to date.  If there is an element of Greek tragedy in ""Oz"" it is this sick little dance between Beecher and Schillinger, with Chris Keller (Chris Meloni) as the wild card.  But running a close second is the twisted relationship that has developed between Ryan O'Reilly (Dean Winters) and Dr. Gloria Nathan (Lauren Velez), which takes the ""you always hurt the one you love"" to some extremes.Even our narrator, the one-man Greek chorus Augustus Hill (Harold Perrineau), starts to become involved in the madness.  After ruining one inmate's chances of parole, Hill finds himself in the middle of the power struggle to control the Homeboys.  This problems have me worried because for me it is not ""Oz"" if Augustus is not explaining to us the different types of shivs you can make in prison (and the fact Perrineau is now on ""Lost"" and without the dreadlocks worries me even more).  But then if there is anything we have learned from ""Oz,"" in addition to never wanting to end up in prison, it is that incarceration does not change people for the better.  Just look at Bob Rebadow (George Morfogen), who tells us that not only does every dog have his day, but once he does he will want another one.The problem with the fourth season of ""Oz"" is that the effort to keep things boiling over has some of the developments going over the top.  The experimental again drug is certainly one example, but the O'Reilly/Nathan relationship also goes beyond belief as far as I am concerned.  By the time the show is drawing inspiration from Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Cask of Amontillado"" I am thinking it is time to be cleaning house.  I have trouble remembering exactly how Emerald City was to be an innovative solution to the problem of the modern American prison in the face of the orgy of violence and keep thinking Glenn and McManus need to just lock down the whole prison.  Of course, that would kill the drama of the show if all we had were men looked into cells, and HBO has no vested interest in doing that.  But ""Oz"" is not about the escelating number of dead inmates, or even of naked inmates, but rather the life and death struggles of the place.  Along with ""The West Wing,"" ""Oz"" represents ""politics"" at its ""best.""",4,"""Oz"" starts to go too far over the rainbow in Season Four",1108252800,"02 13, 2005",2005,4392,"['point', 'final', 'episode', 'Oz', 'Complete', 'Fourth', 'Season', 'where', 'EM', 'City', 'Administrator', 'Tim', 'McManus', 'Terry', 'Kinney', 'inmate', 'who', 'fear', 'life', 'room', 'protective', 'custody', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'put', 'certainly', 'sense', 'given', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'season', 'Was', 'highest', 'body', 'count', 'ever', 'Oz', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'keeping', 'tally', 'point', 'sure', 'seemed', 'was', 'was', 'season', 'where', 'most', 'inmates', 'death', 'row', 'who', 'died', 'were', 'not', 'actually', 'executed', 'state', 'good', 'thing', 'Warden', 'Leo', 'Glenn', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'Governor', 'James', 'Devlin', 'Zeljko', 'Ivanek', 'running', 're-election', 'have', 'boss', 'who', 'inmates', 'killing', 'inmates', 'put', 'delicately', 'not', 'bad', 'thing.The', 'main', 'dynamic', 'fourth', 'season', 'up', 'being', 'Simon', 'Adebisi', 'Adewale', 'Akinnouye-Agbaje', 'Kareem', 'Said', 'Eamonn', 'Walker', 'beginning', 'Oz', 'was', 'Said', 'who', 'been', 'voice', 'reason', 'was', 'Abedisi', 'who', 'personified', 'impulse', 'towards', 'anarchy', 'Oswald', 'Correctional', 'Facility', 'Khan', 'death', 'Said', 'visits', 'Tricia', 'Ross', 'Zahir', 'Arif', 'Granville', 'Adams', 'take', 'over', 'leadership', 'Muslims', 'Said', 'cast', 'adrift', 'hierarchy', 'Emerald', 'City', 'Adebisi', 'objective', 'actually', 'removal', 'McManus', 'administrator', 'Oz', 'course', 'Abedisi', 'success', 'seeds', 'own', 'destruction', 'way', 'things', 'go', 'merry', 'old', 'land', 'Oz', 'Meanwhile', 'Said', 'out', 'Oz', 'men', 'do', 'things', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'do', 'changes', 'ways', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'changed.For', 'suspect', 'many', 'Tobias', 'Beecher', 'Lee', 'Tergesen', 'inmate', 'most', 'identify', 'Oz', 'Beecher', 'regular', 'guy', 'who', 'up', 'prison', 'fresh', 'meat', 'inmates', 'fact', 'survived', 'far', 'not', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'convince', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'half', 'well', 'Beecher', 'survived', 'season', 'ongoing', 'conflict', 'Vern', 'Schillinger', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'even', 'deadlier', 'been', 'date', 'element', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'Oz', 'sick', 'little', 'dance', 'Beecher', 'Schillinger', 'Chris', 'Keller', 'Chris', 'Meloni', 'wild', 'card', 'running', 'close', 'second', 'twisted', 'relationship', 'developed', 'Ryan', ""O'Reilly"", 'Dean', 'Winters', 'Dr.', 'Gloria', 'Nathan', 'Lauren', 'Velez', 'always', 'hurt', 'one', 'love', 'extremes.Even', 'narrator', 'one-man', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'Augustus', 'Hill', 'Harold', 'Perrineau', 'become', 'involved', 'madness', 'ruining', 'one', 'inmate', 'chances', 'parole', 'Hill', 'middle', 'power', 'struggle', 'control', 'Homeboys', 'problems', 'have', 'worried', 'not', 'Oz', 'Augustus', 'not', 'explaining', 'different', 'types', 'shivs', 'can', 'make', 'prison', 'fact', 'Perrineau', 'now', 'Lost', 'dreadlocks', 'worries', 'even', 'more', 'then', 'anything', 'have', 'learned', 'Oz', 'addition', 'never', 'wanting', 'end', 'up', 'prison', 'incarceration', 'not', 'change', 'people', 'better', 'Just', 'look', 'Bob', 'Rebadow', 'George', 'Morfogen', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'dog', 'have', 'day', 'once', 'will', 'want', 'one.The', 'problem', 'fourth', 'season', 'Oz', 'effort', 'keep', 'things', 'boiling', 'over', 'developments', 'going', 'top', 'experimental', 'again', 'drug', 'certainly', 'one', 'example', ""O'Reilly/Nathan"", 'relationship', 'also', 'belief', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'time', 'show', 'drawing', 'inspiration', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'Cask', 'Amontillado', 'am', 'thinking', 'time', 'be', 'cleaning', 'house', 'have', 'trouble', 'remembering', 'exactly', 'how', 'Emerald', 'City', 'was', 'be', 'innovative', 'solution', 'problem', 'modern', 'American', 'prison', 'face', 'orgy', 'violence', 'keep', 'thinking', 'Glenn', 'McManus', 'need', 'just', 'lock', 'down', 'whole', 'prison', 'course', 'would', 'kill', 'drama', 'show', 'had', 'were', 'men', 'looked', 'cells', 'HBO', 'vested', 'interest', 'doing', 'Oz', 'not', 'escelating', 'number', 'dead', 'inmates', 'even', 'naked', 'inmates', 'rather', 'life', 'death', 'struggles', 'place', 'West', 'Wing', 'Oz', 'politics', 'best']",N/A
854582,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,B00031TYBC,Michael J. Mazza,"[7, 7]","Season 4 of ""Oz"" maintains the consistently high quality of writing and acting that have made this prison drama so powerful.  Oswald State Correctional Facility, which is the prison of the series, can be seen as a microcosm for all of American society.  The characters represent many different ethnic, racial, and religious groups; there are men and women; characters who are disabled; characters of different sexual orientations and of different generational groups. The diverse ensemble cast is surely one of the most exciting ever assembled for a TV series.  Season 4 continues to follow many of the characters, relationships, and storylines from previous seasons, while successfully adding some compelling new ones into the mix.  One of the most powerful plot lines involves an undercover police officer's masquerade as an inmate.  Also noteworthy is Luke Perry's role as a disgraced televangelist who becomes an inmate.  The regular characters from earlier seasons continue to grow and change--just when you think you have somebody figured out, he/she might surprise you.  And fans who are fascinated by the fireworks between white supremacist Schillinger and his enemy Beecher will not be disappointed by the twists that their relationship takes in this season.Oz's equilibrium is shaken in this season when a key authority figure is removed from his position; this plot element is used to generate some powerful new character development and plot elements.  The overall story of season 4 has a powerful mythic quality--it's about corruption, rebellion, the building and severing of alliances, and the use and abuse of power.  ""Oz"" attains an epic feel not unlike the ""Star Wars"" saga; it also has qualities like those of ancient Greek or Shakespearian tragedies.  At times the show has a searing satiric edge (particularly when the scripts deal with politics or the media), and while it is a serious drama, season 4 also makes room for humorous sequences.The DVD set for season 4 features some great special features.  The generous selection of deleted scenes offers different perspectives on the characters and conflicts, thus giving a fuller picture of the overall story.  Episode 8 features a joint commentary by series creator Tom Fontana and ensemble member Rita Moreno.  Their engrossing conversation covers many aspects of the show--symbolism, theology, violence, nudity, technical challenges of filming the show, her relationships with the other actors, etc.  I especially liked their behind-the-scenes anecdotes.  It's a serious and very professional commentary that still is full of a lot of laughs.  It's quite a contrast to the episode 16 commentary by Fontana with costars Dean Winters and Lee Tergesen.  The actors raucously mock the show throughout the commentary--it's hilariously subversive fun.I have always thought of ""Oz"" as a taboo-breaking show, but season 4 takes this aspect to an even more intense level.  There is, in particular, one of the most shocking, brutal, and cruel plot twists ever in the four seasons so far.  Season 4 also continues the show's tradition of graphic violence, sex, and nudity.  However, I don't consider these elements gratuitous or exploitative, but rather they are an integral part of the overall moral and artistic vision of the series.  Also compelling is the show's complex exploration of religion and spirituality through the lives of its characters; Catholicism, Protestantism, Islam, and Judaism are all represented.  This is one series that takes religion seriously, and treats it with both intelligence and passion.  Overall, ""Oz"" continues, in season 4, to present a remarkably complex and compelling world.  The series presents the extremes of human cruelty, obsession, lust, and depravity, but also explores the human capacity for love, friendship, kindness, forgiveness, hope, and redemption.  Those who can stomach the often extreme content will, I believe, find season 4 to be a fulfilling journey.",5,"A gripping continuation of the ""Oz"" saga",1140048000,"02 16, 2006",2006,3973,"['Season', '4', 'Oz', 'consistently', 'high', 'quality', 'writing', 'acting', 'have', 'made', 'prison', 'drama', 'so', 'powerful', 'Oswald', 'State', 'Correctional', 'Facility', 'prison', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'microcosm', 'American', 'society', 'characters', 'represent', 'many', 'different', 'ethnic', 'racial', 'religious', 'groups', 'are', 'men', 'women', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'disabled', 'characters', 'different', 'sexual', 'orientations', 'different', 'generational', 'groups', 'diverse', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'surely', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'ever', 'assembled', 'TV', 'series', 'Season', '4', 'follow', 'many', 'characters', 'relationships', 'storylines', 'previous', 'seasons', 'successfully', 'adding', 'compelling', 'new', 'ones', 'mix', 'One', 'most', 'powerful', 'plot', 'lines', 'undercover', 'police', 'officer', 'masquerade', 'inmate', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'role', 'disgraced', 'televangelist', 'who', 'inmate', 'regular', 'characters', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'continue', 'grow', 'change', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'have', 'somebody', 'figured', 'out', 'he/she', 'might', 'surprise', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'fascinated', 'fireworks', 'white', 'supremacist', 'Schillinger', 'enemy', 'Beecher', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'twists', 'relationship', 'season.Oz', 'equilibrium', 'shaken', 'season', 'when', 'key', 'authority', 'figure', 'removed', 'position', 'plot', 'element', 'used', 'generate', 'powerful', 'new', 'character', 'development', 'plot', 'elements', 'overall', 'story', 'season', '4', 'powerful', 'mythic', 'quality', 'corruption', 'rebellion', 'building', 'severing', 'alliances', 'use', 'abuse', 'power', 'Oz', 'epic', 'feel', 'not', 'Star', 'Wars', 'saga', 'also', 'qualities', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'Shakespearian', 'tragedies', 'times', 'show', 'searing', 'satiric', 'edge', 'particularly', 'when', 'scripts', 'deal', 'politics', 'media', 'serious', 'drama', 'season', '4', 'also', 'room', 'humorous', 'sequences.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'season', '4', 'features', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'generous', 'selection', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'offers', 'different', 'perspectives', 'characters', 'conflicts', 'thus', 'giving', 'fuller', 'picture', 'overall', 'story', 'Episode', '8', 'joint', 'commentary', 'series', 'creator', 'Tom', 'Fontana', 'ensemble', 'member', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'engrossing', 'conversation', 'many', 'aspects', 'show', 'symbolism', 'theology', 'violence', 'nudity', 'technical', 'challenges', 'filming', 'show', 'relationships', 'other', 'actors', 'etc', 'especially', 'liked', 'behind-the-scenes', 'anecdotes', 'serious', 'very', 'professional', 'commentary', 'still', 'full', 'lot', 'laughs', 'quite', 'contrast', 'episode', '16', 'commentary', 'Fontana', 'costars', 'Dean', 'Winters', 'Lee', 'Tergesen', 'actors', 'raucously', 'mock', 'show', 'commentary', 'hilariously', 'subversive', 'fun.I', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'Oz', 'taboo-breaking', 'show', 'season', '4', 'aspect', 'even', 'more', 'intense', 'level', 'particular', 'one', 'most', 'shocking', 'brutal', 'cruel', 'plot', 'twists', 'ever', 'four', 'seasons', 'so', 'far', 'Season', '4', 'also', 'show', 'tradition', 'graphic', 'violence', 'sex', 'nudity', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'elements', 'gratuitous', 'exploitative', 'rather', 'are', 'integral', 'part', 'overall', 'moral', 'artistic', 'vision', 'series', 'Also', 'compelling', 'show', 'complex', 'exploration', 'religion', 'spirituality', 'lives', 'characters', 'Catholicism', 'Protestantism', 'Islam', 'Judaism', 'are', 'represented', 'one', 'series', 'religion', 'seriously', 'intelligence', 'passion', 'Overall', 'Oz', 'season', '4', 'present', 'remarkably', 'complex', 'compelling', 'world', 'series', 'extremes', 'human', 'cruelty', 'obsession', 'lust', 'depravity', 'also', 'human', 'capacity', 'love', 'friendship', 'kindness', 'forgiveness', 'hope', 'redemption', 'who', 'can', 'stomach', 'often', 'extreme', 'content', 'will', 'believe', 'find', 'season', '4', 'be', 'fulfilling', 'journey']",N/A
854583,AMZF6CTXFSJRW,B00031TYBC,Michiru,"[3, 3]","This is a positive review, but first I feel obligated to warn potential viewers of just how bloody this season is, even compared to previous ones. A man getting his neck snapped while giving a blow job, a child getting mutilated (mostly off screen, thankfully) and an inmate being buried alive are some of the more shocking twists. These scenes are not too common, nor are they the main point of the show, but they are there.In season four, racial tensions in Oz are at the breaking point. A white boy shoots down several black inmates and so the black population decides to take things into their own hands. Muslim leader Kareem Said and former section leader of Em City Tim McManus have a plan to stop the resultant violence...if they live long enough.Taking up just as much time are the stories of the prisoners' daily lives. Season four has sixteen episodes instead of the usual eight, so all the characters we've come to know and love (or despise) get their time in the spotlight. Struggles with faith, friendship, love and family are the primary plot points this season as several inmates develop new relationships and find lost family members and/or religious beliefs. Many of the vilest inmates struggle for redemption, and some of them get it. Others don't.As in previous seasons, everyman Tobias Beecher centers the show. His romance with sociopath Chris Keller hits a new low as the pair spend months trying to find ways to hurt each other after breaking up. Do they love each other enough to put aside their differences when one really needs the other? Meanwhile, Tobias's growing friendship with Kareem Said forces both to examine dark parts of their souls, while his ongoing (since season one) war with Vern Schillinger takes away part of his family, which in turn takes part of his sanity. Through all the horror, his attempts to keep his compassion are courageous and admirable, though he doesn't always succeed.Various other plotlines thread through. Some work and others don't. On the positive end there are stories like that of the four death row inmates in Oz's walls; their conversations made for some of the most touching and best written scenes in the show. On the other hand there are a few ideas that border on absurd, such as Oz becoming a hotel for Chinese refugees and a romance between a woman and the man that murdered her husband.Fortunately, most of the season and all of the acting is good enough that a few stray plot bunnies are forgivable. Season four of Oz is an emotionally intense, often shocking roller coaster that you won't want to stop watching.

The first two series were exceptionally good, with each episode often finishing on a resoundingly powerful note. By this season though, the show seems to have become hoist by its own patard.Firstly, this series features an inordinate number of dead inmates. Often the most dangerous prisoners will be left alone in large groups without supervision. Also, these same prisoners always seem to manufacture a weapon of some description. All of this is explained only once by a horrid neo-Nazi thug, who says, in the final episode of the series ""I gave the guard a hundred bucks to take a walk"". The most absurd part of the series is early on, when a high powered beaurocrat is shot by a man facing murder charges. It seems the latter is able to just walk into a maximum security prison with a firearm and gun somebody down! Just how are we supposed to believe such nonsense?Why aren't these inmates constantly in lockdown? How can they possibly have access to so many potentially lethal instruments? Why aren't there more guards to supervise? What is the point of Emerald City? These questions became more and more pressing during my viewing of this series. It just got to the point of the ridiculous when, on top of the absurd killing spree, an 'aging' drug is administered to the inmates. Also, the relationship between O'Reilly and Doctor Nathan pushes the bounds of credibility.Ultimately, what once packed a punch in the first two series just becomes tedious and unbelievable in this fourth series. Series three had its moments but it still maintained the intensity and truth of the first two. Series four is just a violent cartoon, and the epigrams of wheelchair-bound Augustus Hill serve only to rationalise the ridiculous. His poetic ramblings, in the context of such unbelievable plot turns, just make things worse.If you can suspend your disbelief in this series you may well enjoy it. Personally, for a show that's supposed to be 'real' and 'gritty', I struggle to think of anything more cartoonish.",2,Loses focus and credibility in this series,1123286400,"08 6, 2005",2005,2114,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', ""'Oz"", 'can', 'proudly', 'say', ""'ve"", 'never', 'missed', 'single', 'episode', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'were', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'episode', 'often', 'finishing', 'resoundingly', 'powerful', 'note', 'season', 'show', 'have', 'become', 'hoist', 'own', 'patard.Firstly', 'series', 'inordinate', 'number', 'dead', 'inmates', 'Often', 'most', 'dangerous', 'prisoners', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'large', 'groups', 'supervision', 'Also', 'same', 'prisoners', 'always', 'seem', 'manufacture', 'weapon', 'description', 'explained', 'only', 'once', 'horrid', 'neo-Nazi', 'thug', 'who', 'final', 'episode', 'series', 'gave', 'guard', 'hundred', 'bucks', 'take', 'walk', 'most', 'absurd', 'part', 'series', 'early', 'when', 'high', 'powered', 'beaurocrat', 'shot', 'man', 'facing', 'murder', 'charges', 'latter', 'able', 'just', 'walk', 'maximum', 'security', 'prison', 'firearm', 'gun', 'somebody', 'down', 'Just', 'how', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'such', 'nonsense', 'Why', 'are', ""n't"", 'inmates', 'constantly', 'lockdown', 'How', 'can', 'possibly', 'have', 'access', 'so', 'many', 'potentially', 'lethal', 'instruments', 'Why', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'more', 'guards', 'supervise', 'What', 'point', 'Emerald', 'City', 'questions', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'pressing', 'viewing', 'series', 'just', 'got', 'point', 'ridiculous', 'when', 'top', 'absurd', 'killing', 'spree', ""'aging"", 'drug', 'administered', 'inmates', 'Also', 'relationship', ""O'Reilly"", 'Doctor', 'Nathan', 'bounds', 'credibility.Ultimately', 'what', 'once', 'packed', 'punch', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'just', 'becomes', 'tedious', 'unbelievable', 'fourth', 'series', 'Series', 'three', 'had', 'moments', 'still', 'maintained', 'intensity', 'truth', 'first', 'two', 'Series', 'four', 'just', 'violent', 'cartoon', 'epigrams', 'wheelchair-bound', 'Augustus', 'Hill', 'only', 'rationalise', 'ridiculous', 'poetic', 'ramblings', 'context', 'such', 'unbelievable', 'plot', 'turns', 'just', 'make', 'things', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'series', 'may', 'well', 'enjoy', 'Personally', 'show', 'supposed', 'be', ""'real"", ""'gritty"", 'struggle', 'think', 'anything', 'more', 'cartoonish']",N/A
854586,A3J029KBNG5MNP,B00031TYBC,Mr. Bey,"[5, 5]","To most fans of HBO's Oz, season four is split up into two parts. Why the creators decided to make it one season escapes me considering the two parts have about as much in common as any other seasons do. The most likely reason is that the length between the two parts was only six months as opposed to the regular year. This only helps the fans though as all sixteen episodes are packaged in one set and costs the exact same as the others. Oz has always been one of the most graphic shows to ever air on TV so if you don't like violence, nudity or anything of that sort, Oz is probably the worst show you could watch. If you are a fan of a character based drama where the rich storylines that are continuously brought up over the shows six year run, Oz is the show for you.Oz is short for the Oswald State Correctional facility a prison where the inmates are among the worst you'll ever see. The bulk of the show revolves around one unit called Emerald City where the inmates are given extra privileges provided they hold a job, behave, and strive to become better people. Of course this doesn't exactly matter and every episode features at least one death of an inmate. The show does deal with the better side of some inmates and shows us that there is some good in prisoners.Season 4 Part 1 is about when Tim McManus, creator of Emerald City is fired and his replacement Martin Querns turns out to be worse than he is. Querns believes that violence is the only problems and lets the most dangerous inmate Simon Adebisi does as he pleases as long as violence is kept to a minimum. Querns transfers most of the white inmates out of Emerald City and the remaining white inmates plan to get rid of him. This part of the season has a shocking ending only Oz would provide and things return to normal.Season 4 Part 2 is more like a typical Oz season. McManus is back and tries to retain order while several prison gangs attempt to take control of the drug trade. Irish inmate Ryan O'Reilly tries to keep his mentally retarded brother Cyril from having violent outbursts and McManus arranges a basketball game against former NBA inmate Jackson Vahue. Narrator August Hill's stepfather, a Vietnam vet by the name of Burr Redding arrives to take control of the Homeboys and the drug trade. All in all this is one of the most action packed seasons of Oz.Oz is unlike any show I've ever seen. Things that happen in each episode than one might consider irrelevant show up years later to haunt whoever committed the action. Characters you think are dead miraculously show up out of nowhere. Oz also features many actors who appeared on shows like Lost, all four Law & Orders (Christopher Meloni and B.D. Wong were cast members of both Law & Order SVU and Oz at the same time), Homicide: Life on the Street, The Wire, and many more. Oz is one of the best written shows I've ever watched and I'm sure if you give it a try you'll be hooked I know I was.",5,Season 4 is Oz at its Best,1197504000,"12 13, 2007",2007,2939,"['most', 'fans', 'HBO', 'Oz', 'season', 'four', 'split', 'up', 'two', 'parts', 'Why', 'creators', 'decided', 'make', 'one', 'season', 'considering', 'two', 'parts', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'common', 'other', 'seasons', 'do', 'most', 'likely', 'reason', 'length', 'two', 'parts', 'was', 'only', 'six', 'months', 'opposed', 'regular', 'year', 'only', 'fans', 'sixteen', 'episodes', 'are', 'packaged', 'one', 'set', 'exact', 'same', 'others', 'Oz', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'graphic', 'shows', 'ever', 'air', 'TV', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'violence', 'nudity', 'anything', 'sort', 'Oz', 'probably', 'worst', 'show', 'could', 'watch', 'are', 'fan', 'character', 'based', 'drama', 'where', 'rich', 'storylines', 'are', 'continuously', 'brought', 'up', 'shows', 'six', 'year', 'run', 'Oz', 'show', 'you.Oz', 'short', 'Oswald', 'State', 'Correctional', 'facility', 'prison', 'where', 'inmates', 'are', 'worst', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'bulk', 'show', 'around', 'one', 'unit', 'called', 'Emerald', 'City', 'where', 'inmates', 'are', 'given', 'extra', 'privileges', 'provided', 'hold', 'job', 'behave', 'strive', 'become', 'better', 'people', 'course', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'matter', 'episode', 'least', 'one', 'death', 'inmate', 'show', 'deal', 'better', 'side', 'inmates', 'good', 'prisoners.Season', '4', 'Part', '1', 'when', 'Tim', 'McManus', 'creator', 'Emerald', 'City', 'fired', 'replacement', 'Martin', 'Querns', 'out', 'be', 'worse', 'Querns', 'violence', 'only', 'problems', 'most', 'dangerous', 'inmate', 'Simon', 'Adebisi', 'as', 'long', 'violence', 'kept', 'minimum', 'transfers', 'most', 'white', 'Emerald', 'City', 'remaining', 'white', 'inmates', 'plan', 'get', 'rid', 'part', 'season', 'shocking', 'ending', 'only', 'Oz', 'would', 'provide', 'things', 'return', 'normal.Season', '4', 'Part', '2', 'more', 'typical', 'Oz', 'season', 'McManus', 'back', 'tries', 'retain', 'order', 'several', 'prison', 'gangs', 'attempt', 'take', 'control', 'drug', 'trade', 'Irish', 'inmate', 'Ryan', ""O'Reilly"", 'keep', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'brother', 'Cyril', 'having', 'violent', 'outbursts', 'McManus', 'basketball', 'game', 'former', 'NBA', 'inmate', 'Jackson', 'Vahue', 'Narrator', 'August', 'Hill', 'stepfather', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'name', 'Burr', 'Redding', 'take', 'control', 'Homeboys', 'drug', 'trade', 'one', 'most', 'action', 'packed', 'seasons', 'Oz.Oz', 'show', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Things', 'happen', 'episode', 'one', 'might', 'consider', 'irrelevant', 'show', 'up', 'years', 'later', 'haunt', 'whoever', 'committed', 'action', 'Characters', 'think', 'are', 'dead', 'miraculously', 'show', 'up', 'nowhere', 'Oz', 'also', 'many', 'actors', 'who', 'appeared', 'shows', 'Lost', 'four', 'Law', 'Orders', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', 'B.D', 'Wong', 'were', 'cast', 'members', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'Oz', 'same', 'time', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Street', 'Wire', 'many', 'more', 'Oz', 'one', 'best', 'written', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', ""'m"", 'sure', 'give', 'try', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hooked', 'know', 'was']",N/A

Durham ""Big Evil""","[18, 20]","As the fourth season of HBO's prison drama Oz, created by Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson, opens, it is clear that the yellow brick road to this prison isn't paved with bricks, but with blood.  This is the season where things explode rather quickly, including the love saga between Tobias Beecher (Lee Tergesen) and Chris Keller (Christopher Meloni) when a new inmate (Brian Bloom) enters the scene and causes some havoc.  Ryan O'Reilly (Dean Winters) wants revenge on a TV newsman whom he met years before, even if it means using his brother Cyril (Scott William Winters) to do it.  Miguel Alvarez (Kirk Acevedo) remains in solitary, wanting freedom more than ever before, while come mid-season, the explosive confrontation between Kareem Said (Eamon Walker) and Simon Adebisi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) will leave your mouth hanging open, and Said has even more problems with white supremicist leader Schillinger (J.K. Simmons) wanting him dead, no matter the cost.  The second half of the season, we are introduced to a televangelist (Luke Perry) with an agenda of his own, and an impact will be left that will shape the series until it's end.  Warden Leo Glynn (Ernie Hudson) and Tim McManus (Terry Kinney) have their hands full throughout the season, but the superb cast (which also includes B.D. Wong, Rita Moreno, and Biohazard singer Evan Seinfeld among others) does terrific work, and the love triangle between Tergesen, Meloni, and Bloom's characters is surprisingly heart wrenching.  Thankfully, HBO released all 16 episodes of the fourth season of Oz on one set, unlike what they've done with the Sex in the City seasons; splitting them up to get more money.  All in all, Oz was one of the most underrated shows on HBO (most of the praise went to Sex in the City, the Sopranos, Curb Your Enthusiasm, etc.), and, just as this season proves, it was one of the best.",5,Down the road again,1107302400,"02 2, 2005",2005,1874,"['fourth', 'season', 'HBO', 'prison', 'drama', 'Oz', 'created', 'Tom', 'Fontana', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'clear', 'yellow', 'brick', 'road', 'prison', ""n't"", 'paved', 'bricks', 'blood', 'season', 'where', 'things', 'explode', 'rather', 'quickly', 'including', 'love', 'saga', 'Tobias', 'Beecher', 'Lee', 'Tergesen', 'Chris', 'Keller', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', 'when', 'new', 'inmate', 'Brian', 'Bloom', 'scene', 'havoc', 'Ryan', ""O'Reilly"", 'Dean', 'Winters', 'revenge', 'TV', 'newsman', 'whom', 'met', 'years', 'even', 'using', 'brother', 'Cyril', 'Scott', 'William', 'Winters', 'do', 'Miguel', 'Alvarez', 'Kirk', 'Acevedo', 'solitary', 'wanting', 'freedom', 'more', 'ever', 'come', 'mid-season', 'explosive', 'confrontation', 'Kareem', 'Said', 'Eamon', 'Walker', 'Simon', 'Adebisi', 'Adewale', 'Akinnuoye-Agbaje', 'will', 'leave', 'mouth', 'hanging', 'open', 'Said', 'even', 'more', 'problems', 'white', 'supremicist', 'leader', 'Schillinger', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'wanting', 'dead', 'matter', 'cost', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'are', 'introduced', 'televangelist', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'agenda', 'own', 'impact', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'will', 'shape', 'series', 'end', 'Warden', 'Leo', 'Glynn', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'Tim', 'McManus', 'Terry', 'Kinney', 'have', 'hands', 'full', 'season', 'superb', 'cast', 'also', 'B.D', 'Wong', 'Rita', 'Moreno', 'Biohazard', 'singer', 'Evan', 'Seinfeld', 'others', 'terrific', 'work', 'love', 'triangle', 'Tergesen', 'Meloni', 'Bloom', 'characters', 'surprisingly', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'Thankfully', 'HBO', 'released', '16', 'episodes', 'fourth', 'season', 'Oz', 'one', 'set', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Sex', 'City', 'seasons', 'splitting', 'up', 'get', 'more', 'money', 'Oz', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'shows', 'HBO', 'most', 'praise', 'went', 'Sex', 'City', 'Sopranos', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'etc', 'just', 'season', 'was', 'one', 'best']",N/A
854588,A26XCS3QLDJJWN,B00031TYBC,"Patrick G. Varine ""Make beats, not war, haha...""","[1, 2]","I am hoping against hope that the fourth season of ""Oz"" is not the one where the series jumps the shark, but reading some of the reviews up here, it seems like it might be.I will be the first to agree that sometimes, it seems as though all of Oz is one big Emerald City: inmates are wandering down dimly-lit halls all on their own, guards are conspicuously absent from murder scenes, etc., etc. It's a TV show, everyone... you have to suspend a little bit of disbelief.Although even an overactive imagination isn't a good excuse for the ridiculously lame 'aging pill' plotline that quite literally went nowhere.What is on display in season four is the tenuousness of relationships between both friends and enemies. Most of the relationships in Oz are volatile to begin with, but the volatility gets shaken up here between Beecher and Keller, Adebisi and Said (as well as Said and his Inner Adebisi...), McManus and Glynn, Ryan and Cyril, EVERYONE is feeling the strain in this season.That said, sometimes it seemed as though things weren't going anywhere. There was no overarching theme to this season, except for seemingly random violence and revenge.There was also a bit of a continuity issue. I have no problem with Hoyt and his fellow bikers taking some ""Cask of Amontillado""-style revenge on Rev. Cloutier; it's pretty clear that there are enough corrupt guards in Oz for stuff like this to get done. But no one even mentions him as missing. Same with The Colonel. No one goes, ""Hey, what happened to that prisoner who was just in here?""I liked the focus on Unit J (the Cop Unit), although the denouement of the Clayton Hughes storyline, while it did provide for some humor -- ""Welcome to the Republic of Hoofa. You shall refer to me as Gamba Kufu"" -- was, to say the least, a little frazzled.Sister Pete and Father Mikada are, as always, solid rocks of wisdom and caring. Glynn gets too wrapped up in politics to keep his mind on the prison, and McManus is, well, McManus.Here's hoping that the fifth season -- I make it a point not to even read the previews on Amazon -- is a continuation of the excellence in the previous four.",4,Hoping this wasn't the Shark Jumper...,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,2135,"['am', 'hoping', 'hope', 'fourth', 'season', 'Oz', 'not', 'one', 'where', 'series', 'shark', 'reading', 'reviews', 'up', 'here', 'might', 'be.I', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'agree', 'sometimes', 'Oz', 'one', 'big', 'Emerald', 'City', 'inmates', 'are', 'wandering', 'down', 'dimly-lit', 'halls', 'own', 'guards', 'are', 'conspicuously', 'absent', 'murder', 'scenes', 'etc.', 'etc', 'TV', 'show', 'everyone', 'have', 'suspend', 'little', 'bit', 'disbelief.Although', 'even', 'overactive', 'imagination', ""n't"", 'good', 'excuse', 'ridiculously', 'lame', ""'aging"", 'pill', 'plotline', 'quite', 'literally', 'went', 'display', 'season', 'four', 'tenuousness', 'relationships', 'friends', 'enemies', 'Most', 'relationships', 'Oz', 'are', 'volatile', 'begin', 'volatility', 'shaken', 'up', 'here', 'Beecher', 'Keller', 'Adebisi', 'Said', 'as', 'well', 'Said', 'Inner', 'Adebisi', 'McManus', 'Glynn', 'Ryan', 'Cyril', 'EVERYONE', 'feeling', 'strain', 'season.That', 'said', 'seemed', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'anywhere', 'was', 'overarching', 'theme', 'season', 'seemingly', 'random', 'violence', 'revenge.There', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'continuity', 'issue', 'have', 'problem', 'Hoyt', 'fellow', 'bikers', 'taking', 'Cask', 'Amontillado', '-style', 'revenge', 'Rev', 'Cloutier', 'pretty', 'clear', 'are', 'enough', 'corrupt', 'guards', 'Oz', 'stuff', 'get', 'done', 'one', 'even', 'missing', 'Same', 'Colonel', 'one', 'Hey', 'what', 'happened', 'prisoner', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'here', 'liked', 'focus', 'Unit', 'J', 'Cop', 'Unit', 'denouement', 'Clayton', 'Hughes', 'storyline', 'did', 'provide', 'humor', 'Welcome', 'Republic', 'Hoofa', 'shall', 'refer', 'Gamba', 'Kufu', 'was', 'say', 'least', 'little', 'frazzled.Sister', 'Pete', 'Father', 'Mikada', 'are', 'always', 'solid', 'rocks', 'wisdom', 'caring', 'Glynn', 'too', 'wrapped', 'up', 'politics', 'keep', 'mind', 'prison', 'McManus', 'well', 'McManus.Here', 'hoping', 'fifth', 'season', 'make', 'point', 'not', 'even', 'read', 'previews', 'Amazon', 'continuation', 'excellence', 'previous', 'four']",N/A

However, the intricate Victorian-style plotting, which leads to an incredible body count for just one season, suggests that ""Oz"" is turning into a soap opera with lots of grit, edge, blood, and nudity. But then, who could ask for more?However, there are two instances in which the writer/creator Tom Fontana has gone way over the top. The first involves a drug trial for prisoners who are to be used as guinea pigs. Prisoners who participate in this voluntariy drug trial will have their sentences drastically reduced.  The drug's purpose is to age prisoners overnight -- giving them wrinkles, gray hair, the works, even unfortunately an occasional death. If you're anything like me you might question why anyone would develop such a drug when an anti-aging drug that turns people younger overnight might be more lucrative in the outside world.  Anyway you slice it, this whole drug trial storyline takes us into Sci-fi Land and is hard to watch with a straight face. What in the world was Mr. Fontana thinking?Equally bizarre is a storyline in which a prominent prisoner is murdered by other prisoners who wall him up alive in the fashion of Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Cask of Amontillado.""

854602,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B00031TYBC,Wheelchair Assassin,"[19, 21]","Coming off the nearly unmitigated brilliance of its third season, season four of Oz sees the show facing the tall order of maintaining the high standards of writing and acting that had characterized much of its history, and more often than not it's a success.  This season is certainly not without its problems, some of them more damaging than others, but the show's visceral and emotional intensity is still very much in evidence, and even a flawed season of Oz is better than just about anything else. Season four picks up almost immediately after the conclusion of season three, with racial animosity in Oswald State Penitentiary at an all-time high, the psychotic Adebisi in possession of a gun and waiting for an opportunity to maximize its destructive potential, Beecher and Keller continuing their tumultuous gay love affair while Nazi leader Schillinger nurses a grudge against both, and Officer Whittlesy suddenly nowhere to be found (a circumstance certainly owing nothing whatsoever to Edie Falco's newfound success on The Sopranos).  Naturally, it's not long before a dramatic catastrophe shakes up the already precarious situation in Emerald City and brings about a new level of disorder accompanied by a wild surfeit of plotlines and a level of bloodletting that's excessive even by Oz's lofty standards.All the killing actually becomes a problem for the show as this season progresses--the constant murders begin to feel increasingly gratuitous after a while, to say nothing of the rather odd fact that nobody seems to have much interest in solving them.  Obviously a prison show is going to rely heavily on the violence factor, but I think the creators of Oz could've distributed the killings far more judiciously and plausibly--The Sopranos, The Shield, and The Wire all take place in violent environments, but they've still managed to maintain an element of shock and impact when a character gets killed off.  On Oz, especially in this season, the deaths (with a few exceptions) and the resulting revolving-door effect on the cast contributed to a somewhat numbing quality that pervades much of the season.  Granted, there is the compensating plus of a train-wreck effect, as I often found myself literally unable to look away from all the carnage, but a little more realism would've gone a long way.In an equally frustrating development, Oz seemed to develop a severe case of ADD in its fourth season, seeing its already somewhat fragmentary plot development crushed under the weight of a huge and fluctuating cast and an emphasis on momentum over coherence.  With double the series's usual complement of episodes, we see a small army of new characters come through Oswald-among them an IRA fugitive on the run since Bloody Sunday, a pack of Chinese refugees, a legion of black street thugs, and a whole bunch of other guys I can barely remember-and few of these new arrivals are around long enough to make much of an impression.  The result is a nonstop barrage of plotlines centered on sex, violence, backstabbing, and double-dealing among the inmates and staff, with character development often feeling perfunctory.  Drug-addled, unpredictable new arrival Omar White, played by Michael Wright, is perhaps the best example of the problems in focus that largely characterize Oz's fourth season.  He comes in at the halfway point with the obvious intention of becoming a major character, but only gets about five minutes an episode in which to get integrated into the show's ever-expanding universe, which isn't easy when he's shanking someone or relapsing on drugs on a weekly basis.  Sure, Omar is blatantly overplayed by Wright, but it's not his fault--with Omar's limited and extremely busy screen time, nuance isn't exactly an option.That this season works as well as it does is a testament to the core of characters who've been at its center from the beginning, along with a few newcomers who do manage to contribute something to show's harrowing, explosive approach.  Even as Oz heads toward its home stretch, Tom Fontana still manages to find new dimensions to explore for his main characters and unfamiliar situations in which to put them.  Sure, the show continues to drag out the Keller-Beecher affair and Ryan O'Reilly's (possibly) unrequited love for Doctor Nathan to diminishing returns, but in other cases we see familiar faces among both the inmates and staff undergoing profound changes in response to a variety of catalytic events.  The staff undergoes some major shakeups as Warden Glynn starts to question his priorities in response to a new career opportunity and Emerald City chief Tim McManus slides deeper into depression and instability, but as always it's events among the inmates that take center stage, and to its credit the show is far from out of ideas when it comes to some of the major players behind bars.  Kareem Said, especially, continues to emerge as one of the most complex and well-developed TV characters in history, played in memorably intense fashion by Eamonn Walker and imbued by the writing with a level of nuance that would be extremely difficult to bring to a Muslim character in the wake of 9/11.  Said finds himself facing down a host of challenges to his ecumenical, non-violent worldview, none more prominent than a mid-season shocker that puts him on a sharp emotional spiral.  For his part, it can be a little disorienting seeing a sadistic bigot and rapist like Schillinger studying scripture and eagerly awaiting the birth of his grandchild, but it does actually square with the pro-family, God-country-and-race message he's always propagated.  Perhaps the best turn of the season other that Walker's, though, is submitted by Harold Perrineau as Augustus Hill, the wheelchair-bound lifer who serves as the show's narrator and often as its voice of reason.  Hill has always been something of a moral center for the show, at least on the inmate side, and season four sees his character fleshed out a lot more fully than ever before as details about his past emerge and collide with some major developments in his present to produce an increasingly complete character in his own right.Amidst the sea of new faces (many of whom quickly meet their ends), a few characters do also manage to survive long enough and get sufficient attention to become standouts as well.  Anthony Chisholm is great as Burr Redding, a crafty, perpetually snarling drug lord hardened by a combination of Vietnam and the city streets he grew up on.  Redding may be a vicious stone killer, but he's still got a logical moral code, and he's philosophical and introspective enough that I couldn't help but like him.  His shrewd leadership ends up galvanizing Emerald City's black gangster elements for an ongoing war against the Latino faction led by the stylish and calculating Enrique Morales and the mafiosi under Chucky Pancamo, with predictably dramatic consequences for Em City's residents.  Presaging the great work he would later do on HBO's incredibly brilliant The Wire, Lance Reddick does a powerful and intense turn as John Basil (aka Desmond Mobay), an undercover cop who goes into Emerald City with the best of intentions but quickly finds himself in over his head.  Similarly, future Wire cast member Reg E. Cathey, easily one of the coolest actors hardly anybody has heard of, has a huge impact on the show in a relatively long arc as the charismatic Martin Querns, who replaces Tim as Em City's unit administrator and brings with him a hidden agenda that only serves to heighten Oz's already incendiary racial tensions.  Shockingly enough, Luke Perry manages to make a similar impact on the show's dynamics as Jeremiah Cloutier, a larcenous ex-televangelist who comes in and makes some dramatic changes to Oz's spiritual order, at least to the extent that one exists.In another welcome development, the show does make use of this season's larger allotment of episdoes to expand its focus beyond Emerald City, better living up to its title as it examines much more of its central institution.  Continuing and expanding on a saga starting in season two, season four spends a great deal of time following the fortunes of creepy child-killer Shirley Bellinger and her new neighbors on death row.  Despite the natural feeling of impending doom, there's still a somewhat lighthearted, darkly humorous feeling to the proceedings on death row, although that starts to subside as its residents meet their inevitable fates, albeit not always in a predictable fashion.  The isolated cop wing, too, gets a couple of additions from the regular cast as the tragic story of the perpetually angry ex-correctional officer Clayton Hughes takes a series of turns for the worse.Overall, while season four doesn't mark the best Oz has to offer, that certainly doesn't mean it's in any way without value.  It takes a lot of risks, not all of which pan out, but it does at least demonstrate an admirable commitment to avoiding creative stasis as it approaches the beginning of its end, which is more than can be said for a lot of shows.  And as usual, whatever else can be said about Oz, there's no denying its singular ferocity and almost total uniqueness.  Despite some reservations, this season (and show) still gets a thumbs-up.",4,"Oz goes off the rails, but in a good way",1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,9269,"['Coming', 'off', 'nearly', 'unmitigated',
