The story looked interesting, and the cast was very promising, so when I got to watch it, it was everything I expected and more.The story balances drama, romance and comedy amazingly; you have a little bit of everything. The writing is spectacular, and every scene makes you smile (even the sad ones), and you get to see a different side of life with this movie. It also handles time travel so well, with no extra drama, just like everyone would handle it if anyone would have the ability to do it.I also think a movie is great when you love the characters instantly, and this happens with ""About Time""; the characters are so well written that you get to see how Tim's ""power"" affects all of them (except his dad) without even knowing, every decision we make can change our life dramatically and we don't even notice, that is the best part of this film. You take everything for granted, but every small decision took us to where we are now. Mary and Tim's chemistry was undeniable too.The movie makes you see a different side of life, and you appreciate everything more when you finish watching the movie.

1626841,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00BEIYGK2,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","So, the other night while snuggling up on the couch with my wife and my eight month old son watching &#8216;About Time&#8217; I found myself looking down at him and wishing upon all wishes that I could have the same conversation with him that Bill Nighy gets to have with Domhnall Gleeson in this movie.  I mean, how cool would it be to be able to your son down when he is 21 and just completely blow his mind.&#8220;By the way son, you come from a family of time travelers and it&#8217;s about time you start getting things right.&#8221;So, I&#8217;m staring at him staring up at me and I&#8217;m going over in my head how cool this scenario would be, were it actually possible, and then we reach some pinnacle moments in the film and I&#8217;m again staring down at him and feeling incredibly happy and relieved that we&#8217;ll never have this conversation and that the conversations we&#8217;re going to have are going to mean so much more because of that very fact.&#8220;By the way son, you only get to live your life once, so let&#8217;s embrace it for what it is; hiccups and all.&#8221;A few months ago my wife and I were at the theater, I think it was to see &#8216;Enough Said&#8217;, when we first saw the trailer for this film.  It&#8217;s hard to describe the feeling you get when you just know something is going to be special.  I have that feeling every once in a while when I&#8217;m watching a film trailer.  It doesn&#8217;t always pan out (I had a similar feeling while watching the trailer for &#8216;The Spectacular Now&#8217;), but when it does it really is, well, special.  I remember looking over at my wife and she was smiling and she leans in and whispers &#8220;we need to see that&#8221; and I always like when she does that because she&#8217;s rarely excited about movies in general, and so it&#8217;s nice when we can both connect on that level.  Sadly, children block us from getting to the theater often and so we had to wait.The wait was worth it.It&#8217;s also quite funny that it was while waiting to see &#8216;Enough Said&#8217; that my wife and I first heard of this movie, because for me those two films are probably the best relationship films I saw this year, both of them separated by a certain demographic and yet connected in the pure honest and delightful way in which they develop and portray the relationships we see on screen.  While many will focus on the gimmick of time travel here, I&#8217;m so happy to say that the film does NOT focus on that gimmick.We don&#8217;t know how or why they time travel, and quite frankly, I don&#8217;t care.The film tells the story of Tim, a socially awkward young man who, one New Year&#8217;s Eve, is given the thrill of his life.  His father sits him down and confesses to him that he has a gift.  In fact, every male in their family has this gift, the gift of time travel.  They can enter a dark place, clench their fists and focus on a moment in time that they personally lived through and BAM, they are there and can relive it and change it even.  Of course, with this ability comes responsibility and consequence, but with it also comes some pretty incredible opportunities and advantages.Love, marriage and a baby carriage.But &#8216;About Time&#8217; is about so much more than finding love or fixing your mistakes or perfecting yourself.  At the heart of &#8216;About Time&#8217; is a beautiful story about just that, spending time.  While Tim&#8217;s instinct is to make money or find romance, his father&#8217;s approach to the whole thing is far more relaxed and laid back.  In time, Tim uncovers why, and with that knowledge his time travel takes on a much deeper meaning.I&#8217;m just going to say it; this movie made me cry SO MUCH.  That walk on the beach DESTROYED ME.  There is nothing in the world that I wouldn&#8217;t give to live those moments every single day, but the reality of life is that it is impossible to do that.  The beauty of this film is that it highlights those moments and the ability we have to appreciate them to the full, if we try.",5,Life is what you make it...,1395360000,"03 21, 2014",2014,4061,"['So', 'other', 'night', 'snuggling', 'up', 'couch', 'wife', 'eight', 'month', 'old', 'son', 'watching', '8216', 'Time', '8217', 'found', 'looking', 'down', 'wishing', 'wishes', 'could', 'have', 'same', 'conversation', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'have', 'Domhnall', 'Gleeson', 'movie', 'mean', 'how', 'cool', 'would', 'be', 'be', 'able', 'son', 'down', 'when', '21', 'just', 'completely', 'blow', 'mind.', '8220', 'way', 'son', 'come', 'family', 'time', 'travelers', '8217', 's', 'time', 'start', 'getting', 'things', 'right.', '8221', 'So', '8217', 'staring', 'staring', 'up', '8217', 'going', 'head', 'how', 'cool', 'scenario', 'would', 'be', 'were', 'actually', 'possible', 'then', 'reach', 'pinnacle', 'moments', 'film', '8217', 'again', 'staring', 'down', 'feeling', 'incredibly', 'happy', 'relieved', '8217', 'never', 'have', 'conversation', 'conversations', '8217', 're', 'going', 'have', 'are', 'going', 'mean', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'very', 'fact.', '8220', 'way', 'son', 'only', 'get', 'live', 'life', 'once', 'let', '8217', 'embrace', 'what', 'hiccups', 'all.', '8221', 'A', 'few', 'months', 'wife', 'were', 'theater', 'think', 'was', 'see', '8216', 'Enough', 'Said', '8217', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'film', '8217', 's', 'hard', 'describe', 'feeling', 'get', 'when', 'just', 'know', 'something', 'going', 'be', 'special', 'have', 'feeling', 'once', 'while', 'when', '8217', 'watching', 'film', 'trailer', '8217', 'always', 'pan', 'out', 'had', 'similar', 'feeling', 'watching', 'trailer', '8216', 'Spectacular', 'Now', '8217', 'when', 'really', 'well', 'special', 'remember', 'looking', 'over', 'wife', 'was', 'smiling', 'whispers', '8220', 'need', 'see', '8221', 'always', 'when', '8217', 'rarely', 'excited', 'movies', 'general', '8217', 'nice', 'when', 'can', 'connect', 'level', 'Sadly', 'children', 'block', 'getting', 'theater', 'often', 'so', 'had', 'wait.The', 'wait', 'was', 'worth', 'it.It', '8217', 's', 'also', 'quite', 'funny', 'was', 'waiting', 'see', '8216', 'Enough', 'Said', '8217', 'wife', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'relationship', 'films', 'saw', 'year', 'separated', 'certain', 'demographic', 'yet', 'connected', 'pure', 'honest', 'delightful', 'way', 'develop', 'portray', 'relationships', 'see', 'screen', 'many', 'will', 'focus', 'gimmick', 'time', 'travel', 'here', '8217', 'so', 'happy', 'say', 'film', 'NOT', 'focus', 'gimmick.We', 'don', '8217', 'know', 'how', 'why', 'time', 'travel', 'quite', 'frankly', 'don', '8217', 'care.The', 'film', 'story', 'Tim', 'socially', 'awkward', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'one', 'New', 'Year', '8217', 'Eve', 'given', 'thrill', 'life', 'father', 'down', 'confesses', 'gift', 'fact', 'male', 'family', 'gift', 'gift', 'time', 'travel', 'can', 'enter', 'dark', 'place', 'clench', 'fists', 'focus', 'moment', 'time', 'personally', 'lived', 'BAM', 'are', 'there', 'can', 'relive', 'change', 'even', 'course', 'ability', 'responsibility', 'consequence', 'also', 'pretty', 'incredible', 'opportunities', 'advantages.Love', 'marriage', 'baby', 'carriage.But', '8216', 'Time', '8217', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'finding', 'love', 'fixing', 'mistakes', 'perfecting', 'heart', '8216', 'Time', '8217', 'beautiful', 'story', 'just', 'spending', 'time', 'Tim', '8217', 'instinct', 'make', 'money', 'find', 'romance', 'father', '8217', 'approach', 'whole', 'thing', 'far', 'more', 'relaxed', 'laid', 'back', 'time', 'Tim', 'uncovers', 'why', 'knowledge', 'time', 'travel', 'much', 'deeper', 'meaning.I', '8217', 'just', 'going', 'say', 'movie', 'made', 'cry', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'walk', 'beach', 'DESTROYED', 'ME', 'nothing', 'world', 'wouldn', '8217', 'give', 'live', 'moments', 'single', 'day', 'reality', 'life', 'impossible', 'do', 'beauty', 'film', 'moments', 'ability', 'have', 'appreciate', 'full', 'try']",N/A
1626842,A1HWXELXQEY17K,B00BEIYGK2,Andrew K Rawls,"[0, 0]","I enjoyed ""About Time"" and thought the film was very clever. I know the so-called ""plot holes"" and the films breakage of the ""time traveling rules"" henceforth setup early on by Tim's father may have appeared to of been violated in the latter half of the film, but aside from these extremely minor inconsistencies the film remains true to its core. However, that said, the two confusing issues worth mentioning are Tim's sister's ability to time travel when his father clearly indicates, ""Only male members of the family can do so"" and the film also left me wondering about those stuck in the future. For example Tim is able to travel back in time and change the past which ultimately affects the future, but what about those permanently stuck in the future? How can a future that's already been written be rewritten since other people don't have the ability to travel back in time with him? As a science fiction fan with the rules ever so slightly vague it kept me wondering about what could and could not happen (though not necessarily a bad thing). I don't know what Woody Allen would think of this picture but to a certain extent it does remind me of his ""Midnight in Paris"" particularly with the characters ability to go back in time. Some of the techniques employed such as scene repeatage made this film very ""Dr. Who"" and ""Groundhog Day"" `esque and will give watchers a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Obviously Rachel McAdams is a very talented actress and while the story/screenplay isn't forcefully committed to an exact direction or brilliantly written by any means her acting is what holds this film together. The picture is filled with plenty of good one liners. I enjoyed the scene where Tim announces he's getting married. His fianc&eacute; (McAdams) is seated across the table and his uncle abruptly says ""To who""? Tim then announces the wedding will come quick because they are having a baby and the uncle asks the fianc&eacute;, ""Who is the father""? Very funny stuff! I liked the overall simplicity of this sci-fi romance comedy and while it's no ""Midnight in Paris"" it's certainly worth a view.

1626882,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00BEIYGK2,Darren,"[3, 4]","Well, I guess I'll be the Grumpy Cat here.  I've not even seen &#34;The Time Traveler's Wife&#34;, which apparently also starred Rachel McAdams -- I only know &#34;Groundhog Day&#34;, and this movie certainly copies (or &#34;homages&#34;, as they say in film school) that older movie.  A man gets to relive his bad moments over and over again until they're good moments.  I'm sorry, but this is just rank plagiarism by Richard Curtis.  Worse than that, though, is that the rules of time-travel in this movie are so arbitrary as to be confusing and contradictory.  Domhnall Gleeson can go into an isolated space like a closet, close his hands into fists, and wish really hard to go back to a certain moment in time ... fine and dandy, but wouldn't the future, even in the short-run, be altered in a fundamental way each time he does this?  Hasn't Curtis ever seen &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34;, for goodness' sake?  The movie tries to address this logic problem when Gleeson gets a shock looking at his toddler after one of his travels back in time, but that only happened because he went WAY back to help out his sister.  What if that subtle change of events prevented him from ever meeting McAdams?  (No toddler then!)  And why can only men in this family go back in time?  And why not forward in time?  Sci-Fi nerds, break out your slide-rules!  Compare all this nonsense to &#34;Groundhog Day&#34;, where the rules were straightforward: one 24 hour period, relived, over and over again.  Simplicity: It's Super-Effective!Curtis has said that &#34;About TIme&#34; will likely be his last film, and I hate to say this, but that's probably a pretty good thing.  Whatever mojo he once had has dissolved into weepy mush.  This movie tells us to enjoy life, recognize its beauty, and to live each day to the fullest ... all good advice, mind, but also pretty easy advice if you're like the family in this film with their palatial seaside manse in Cornwall and seemingly endless amount of leisure time and money.  Clearly, patriarch Bill Nighy must have watched the winning numbers on a lottery program at some point, wished himself back in time a few hours, filled out a slip, and cashed in -- hence the otherwise unexplained &#34;retired at 50&#34; thing.  Anyway.  20 years ago, Curtis' films had a little edge to them, had the occasionally funny oddball supporting character, and, most importantly, had Hugh Grant, who was handsome enough and charismatic enough to carry off the sort of role that young Mr. Gleeson takes on here.  I can't speak to the looks, but the charisma is sorely missed.  Because Curtis has always tried to appeal to both sides of The Pond, we get American McAdams cast as the love interest.  Just once, I'd like to see the complicated paperwork these movie characters have to fill out in order to to live as a working citizen, married to a national, in another country.  But then I'm probably asking to much of a movie whose hero can go in a dark room, close his eyes, and go back in time 20 minutes, a month, or 10 years.  By the way, does anyone else think that the marriage between Gleeson and McAdams is on fundamentally rocky ground?  Besides the citizenship paperwork, there's the little matter of Gleeson's time-travel and how he manipulated the relationship.  McAdams never knows about Gleeson's powers.  Dishonesty from the get-go.  By comparison, in &#34;Groundhog Day&#34;, Bill Murray confesses to Andie McDowell more than once that he's living the same day over and over.  Well, Gleeson does take his sister with him on a time-travel jaunt, but the sister is &#34;freaky&#34; and perhaps doomed; therefore, she doesn't &#34;count&#34; (?)  Oh who knows the reasoning here?  It's all absurd.Harold Ramis died a few days ago.  I only mention this because, apart from directing and writing so many movies in the 70s and 80s that became mothers-milk to old Generation Xers like me, he was also the guy who directed the masterpiece I keep referring to in this review:  &#34;Groundhog Day&#34;.  If you remember his work fondly, then I recommend honoring his memory by watching that movie again, rather than this teary-eyed and borderline-insipid knockoff.  2 out of 5, and that's generous, frankly.",2,"Been there, done that",1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,4232,"['Well', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'be', 'Grumpy', 'Cat', 'here', ""'ve"", 'not', 'even', 'seen', '34', 'Time', 'Traveler', 'Wife', '34', 'apparently', 'also', 'starred', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'only', 'know', '34', 'Groundhog', 'Day', '34', 'movie', 'certainly', 'copies', '34', 'homages', '34', 'say', 'film', 'school', 'older', 'movie', 'man', 'relive', 'bad', 'moments', 'over', 'again', ""'re"", 'good', 'moments', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'just', 'rank', 'plagiarism', 'Richard', 'Curtis', 'Worse', 'though', 'rules', 'time-travel', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'arbitrary', 'be', 'confusing', 'contradictory', 'Domhnall', 'Gleeson', 'can', 'go', 'isolated', 'space', 'closet', 'close', 'hands', 'fists', 'wish', 'really', 'hard', 'go', 'back', 'certain', 'moment', 'time', 'fine', 'dandy', 'would', ""n't"", 'future', 'even', 'short-run', 'be', 'altered', 'fundamental', 'way', 'time', 'Has', ""n't"", 'Curtis', 'ever', 'seen', '34', 'Wonderful', 'Life', '34', 'goodness', 'sake', 'movie', 'address', 'logic', 'problem', 'when', 'Gleeson', 'shock', 'looking', 'toddler', 'one', 'travels', 'back', 'time', 'only', 'happened', 'went', 'WAY', 'back', 'help', 'out', 'sister', 'What', 'subtle', 'change', 'events', 'prevented', 'ever', 'meeting', 'McAdams', 'toddler', 'then', 'why', 'can', 'only', 'men', 'family', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'why', 'not', 'forward', 'time', 'Sci-Fi', 'nerds', 'break', 'out', 'slide-rules', 'Compare', 'nonsense', '34', 'Groundhog', 'Day', '34', 'where', 'rules', 'were', 'straightforward', 'one', '24', 'hour', 'period', 'relived', 'over', 'again', 'Simplicity', 'Super-Effective', 'Curtis', 'said', '34', 'TIme', '34', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'last', 'film', 'hate', 'say', 'probably', 'pretty', 'good', 'thing', 'mojo', 'once', 'had', 'dissolved', 'weepy', 'mush', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'life', 'recognize', 'beauty', 'live', 'day', 'fullest', 'good', 'advice', 'mind', 'also', 'pretty', 'easy', 'advice', ""'re"", 'family', 'film', 'palatial', 'seaside', 'manse', 'Cornwall', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'amount', 'leisure', 'time', 'money', 'Clearly', 'patriarch', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'must', 'have', 'watched', 'winning', 'numbers', 'lottery', 'program', 'point', 'wished', 'back', 'time', 'few', 'hours', 'filled', 'out', 'slip', 'cashed', 'hence', 'otherwise', 'unexplained', '34', 'retired', '50', '34', 'thing', 'Anyway', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'Curtis', 'films', 'had', 'little', 'edge', 'had', 'occasionally', 'funny', 'oddball', 'supporting', 'character', 'most', 'importantly', 'had', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'who', 'was', 'handsome', 'enough', 'charismatic', 'enough', 'carry', 'off', 'sort', 'role', 'young', 'Mr.', 'Gleeson', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'looks', 'charisma', 'sorely', 'missed', 'Curtis', 'always', 'tried', 'appeal', 'sides', 'Pond', 'get', 'American', 'McAdams', 'cast', 'love', 'interest', 'Just', 'once', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'complicated', 'paperwork', 'movie', 'characters', 'have', 'fill', 'out', 'order', 'live', 'working', 'citizen', 'married', 'national', 'country', 'then', ""'m"", 'probably', 'asking', 'much', 'movie', 'hero', 'can', 'go', 'dark', 'room', 'close', 'eyes', 'go', 'back', 'time', '20', 'minutes', 'month', '10', 'years', 'way', 'anyone', 'else', 'think', 'marriage', 'Gleeson', 'McAdams', 'fundamentally', 'rocky', 'ground', 'citizenship', 'paperwork', 'little', 'matter', 'Gleeson', 'time-travel', 'how', 'manipulated', 'relationship', 'McAdams', 'never', 'Gleeson', 'powers', 'Dishonesty', 'get-go', 'comparison', '34', 'Groundhog', 'Day', '34', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Andie', 'McDowell', 'more', 'once', 'living', 'same', 'day', 'Well', 'Gleeson', 'take', 'sister', 'time-travel', 'jaunt', 'sister', '34', 'freaky', '34', 'perhaps', 'doomed', 'therefore', ""n't"", '34', 'count', '34', 'Oh', 'who', 'reasoning', 'here', 'absurd.Harold', 'Ramis', 'died', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'only', 'mention', 'apart', 'directing', 'writing', 'so', 'many', 'movies', '70s', '80s', 'became', 'mothers-milk', 'old', 'Generation', 'Xers', 'was', 'also', 'guy', 'who', 'directed', 'masterpiece', 'keep', 'referring', 'review', '34', 'Groundhog', 'Day', '34', 'remember', 'work', 'fondly', 'then', 'recommend', 'honoring', 'memory', 'watching', 'movie', 'again', 'rather', 'teary-eyed', 'borderline-insipid', 'knockoff', '2', '5', 'generous', 'frankly']",N/A

Of course, not fully understanding the ramifications of time travel he accidentally erases the recent chance meeting he had with Mary, played by Rachel McAdams, and as such he no longer has her contact information and she will no longer remember him at all.It is fascinating to watch Tim move through events in his life with the realization that he could go back and fix them if he said or did something wrong.

To show as an example, the guy Tim showed a notebook showing a ""TOTAL DICK"" pointing at his boss in front of two other coworkers.  Try that in California, he will get fired or get very close to getting fired.  The company and boss try to make everybody as dispensable as possible so they don't have to rely on a particular person and therefore the company can fire the person any time.  In California, if you are nice and sweet, people find you as the target for bullying, to achieve their purposes in life of their own agendas.

1626909,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BEIYGK2,FNDNreview,"[5, 8]","It should be quite clear by now that Hollywood and moviegoers have this undying interest in the premise of time travel.  Generally speaking, time travel flicks are notorious for being either incredibly good or horribly bad.  Just a few of the most beloved films include Back to the Future, The Terminator, and Groundhog Day.  On the flip side, there have been quite a few films that had potential, but just brutally missed their mark.  Just a few of these easily forgettable flicks include The Butterfly Effect, Black Knight, and Land of the Lost.  You'd think a subject like establishing a coherent timeline for the benefit of telling a story would be relatively easy, but often times the writers and filmmakers overlook vital facts that completely ruin and overshadow the whole film.  In other words, attempting to make a successful time travel film can be some risky business, yet they are still attempted - quite often, in fact.  It's also a bit of a rarity to see a romantic comedy incorporated with time travel, all of which happens to be rolled together and incorporated in the new film, About Time.Written and directed by Richard Curtis (Love Actually, Pirate Radio), About Time stars Domhnall Gleeson as Tim, a young man that's told by his father (Bill Nighy) that he has the ability to time travel.  Tim quickly decides he's going to use his ability to find love - while also helping his family and friends along the way.  One night on a blind date, Tim meets Mary (Rachel McAdams) and helplessly falls for her.  Using his ability, he rewrites their meeting and molds their relationship into a modern day love story.  However, over the course of his life, Tim discovers that he can't always fix every problem just because he has the power to go back in time.  Lindsay Duncan, Lydia Wilson, Tom Hollander, and Margot Robbie also star in supporting roles.If you watch this film and end up saying something like, ""I don't know who any of those actors were, but they were pretty good,"" you won't be the only one.  Lead actor Domhnall Gleeson will be nearly unrecognizable to the majority of viewers, but Harry Potter fans will surely know his face, previously playing Bill Weasley in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 & 2.  Regardless, About Time could be the gem that jump-starts Gleeson's career as he resoundingly demonstrates his ability to carry the load as a lead actor.  He's witty when he needs to be, peculiar at times, but obviously has a firm grasp on his emotionally-fueled character.  While you'd assume his best scenes and chemistry would be with fellow co-star Rachel McAdams, it's really with Bill Nighy - portraying his father.  Gleeson and Nighy easily steal the show with their father/son bond, providing several laughs - and the eventual tears.British and Scottish fans are more likely to recognize the faces in this film, including Bill Nighy, Lindsay Duncan, and Tom Hollander, but American fans will quickly identify Rachel McAdams - famous for her roles in romantic films, including The Notebook and The Time Traveler's Wife.  Although McAdams, who plays the main love interest, is present for the majority of the film, her character offers very little in substance.  This film is nearly and almost purely male driven, focusing on Gleeson's character, almost to the extent that her only purpose is to react to whatever Gleeson says or does in any given situation.  So, in a lot of ways, it feels like McAdams is only along for the ride.  Her chemistry with Gleeson is average, but nothing outstanding or monumental - despite the fact that they make for an odd couple.  Her character's only real contribution is to relay Richard Curtis' odd devotion and obsession with English model, Kate Moss.This film is a much more romantically theme-driven than it is about time travel, often focusing on the choices of the male characters in regards to his love life, family, and friends.  And, like many time travel flicks, About Time provides an interesting tale that asks the question, if you had the power of time travel, what would you go back and change?  The execution of the plot is a bit blotchy at times, but for the most part, this film is funny and enjoyable for the whole family.  At times, it looks and sounds far too much like a Hallmark card, but that's obviously the nature of Richard Curtis, who has previously written several popular romantic comedies, including Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary, and Four Weddings and a Funeral.  And, keeping with the trend of those films, Curtis writes these characters with a tremendous amount of personality.  Their charm is addictive, and often intoxicating to the extent that you won't be able to stop yourself from embracing their cheeky ambition for happiness.The main underlying issue of this film comes from the pre-mentioned difficulty with writing a story revolving around the use of time travel.  At first, the rules Tim must abide by seem rather tame and harmless.  He obviously only has to contend with the proverbial ""butterfly effect"" where any changes that are made could have dire consequences on other people.  Of course, just when you think there's very little controversy to be had, the father steps in and adds more rules - creating time travel drama.  Obviously, it's difficult to go into detail without spoiling plot points, but the main issue is even though this film gives itself rules - it can't seem to follow them, creating several gapping plot holes that will leave many scratching their heads.  The good news is these roles aren't terrible enough to cast a shadow over the film.Overall, About Time is a quality picture, featuring an enjoyable cast and halfway ambitious story.  Even though this film mostly features a youthful ensemble, it will largely be a draw for an older crowd.  The plot is plausible enough that viewers won't lose their mind attempting to interpret the time travel jumps, so best rest assured that this film does focus squarely on romance, landing laughs, and jerking tears.  Domhnall Gleeson proves he's capable of being the leading man and undoubtedly thrives with a lovely supporting cast.  There may be brief moments of plot confusion, but they will quickly drift away, replaced with plenty of laughter - especially from Bill Nighy.  In the long term, whether this romantic comedy has the ability to ultimately contend with the likes of popular flicks like The Notebook or Love Actually remains to be seen.

Add a fine cast of actors, a bit of a kink with time travel (of sorts) and out comes this little British confection perfect for Valentine's Day - or any day when an uplifting bit of romantic fluff is needed.The setting for the most part is Cornwall and the film is narrated by 21year old Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) who is awkward with finding a girlfriend and in general unlucky in love, as played out in a rather disastrous New Year's Eve party. But things change when Tim's father (Bill Nighy) tells his son that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. Tim can't change history, but he can change what happens and has happened in his own life-so he decides to make his world a better place...by getting a girlfriend. Sadly, that turns out not to be as easy as you might think. Moving to London to train as a lawyer, Tim finally meets the beautiful but insecure Mary (Rachel McAdams). They fall in love, and then an unfortunate time-travel incident means he's never met her at all. So they meet for the first time again-and again-but finally, after a lot of cunning time traveling, he wins her heart. Tim then uses his power to create the perfect romantic proposal, to save his wedding from the worst best-man speeches, to save his best friend, playwright Harry (Tom Hollander) from professional disaster, and to get his pregnant wife to the hospital in time for the birth of their daughter, despite a nasty traffic jam outside Abbey Road. During his life, Tim uses his gift to fix not only his errors, but also in the lives of his relatives and friends.Tim's family is a bit on the loony side and in addition to Bill Nighy as his wondrously gifted father, there is Lindsay Duncan is his mum, Richard Cordery is his space cadet Uncle D and Lydia Wilson is his sister nutty but sweet sister Kit Kat. Margot Robbie, Vanessa Kirby, Will Merrick and Tom Hughes offer excellent cameos. The time travel idea peters out once the film has started but the idea has been planted and helps make this frothy film float. `We're all traveling through time together, every day of our lives. All we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable ride.'

1626921,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B00BEIYGK2,Gryphonisle,"[0, 0]","While technically accurate (like the explanations of a politician), the official description of this film is deceptive.  It would seem to say that this is a movie where a guy goes back in time---say another era---and brings a girl forward in time, or stays there.  No, not at all.  On his 21st birthday, and after an embarrassing New Year's Eve party where he'd behaved like a cad, Tim's father (Bill Nighy---whom I'm coming to delight in finding in a film, much the same way it's always a pleasure to see Maggie Smith show up) tells him that the men of their family can time travel...BUT...Only within the span of their own life an memories,  AND it doesn't really seem to have any consequences if you change anything (contrary to all we've been told).  Although...  He warns his son that going after wealth and the like has ruined the lives of previous male relatives.  No worry though, the son  (played by a very expressive and watchable Domhnall Gleason) announces that all he wants is love.  And at that moment it seems the movie is doomed---it's just the sort of stupid thing you'd expect todays low-expectation minded youth would say.  And for a bit, it seems the movie is going to play that line.  The first thing Tim does is to go back to that awful NYE party and fix things---by kissing the wall flower he found himself standing next to at midnight, also without a date.  Then he tries to fix other issues that come up, each getting more and more complex and the solutions begin to have unanticipated consequences, until finally, fatefully, he realizes that somethings shouldn't be fixed, and that some people can't be helped by extracting them from problems they need to solve.And then, he gets married (the wedding itself provides some great moments where both father and son are popping back and forth in time to fix a particular moment at the wedding) and has his first child.  It is with this event that we find there are indeed more conditions on time travel.  Once you have a child, a line is drawn across your ability to travel backward---go back before the birth and you end up with a different child when you come back...  Thus, from here the movie builds to a rather unexpectedly poignant climax...and I should probably say no more.It was very watchable, entertaining and humorous.  I'm not sure how often I'd watch it though---one of the characteristics that for me drives the star ratings.  Still, it's a very nice rom-com, and if you like those you should like this effort.  An added incentive:  It's not really a female centric rom-com;  the focus is on the men in the film---the wedding, for example is not a centerpiece of the film and there is no bridezilla component, the usual idea in rom-com marriage scenes, it's just a set piece for the idea of time travel as the film explains it.  I would hazard the suggestion that it might be a romantic film for the date who doesn't usually like to sit through rom-coms, or at least after you sit through his blasto-hacko-whacko bombadventure.

Plus, it boasts the most hilarious wedding reception I think I've ever seen.A young man inherits a family trait that allows him to replay key moments in time and change them to his advantage. We come to laugh out loud whenever he says ""Would you please excuse me for a moment?""It features:* Domhnall Gleeson (""Anna Karenina"") is Tim, the fellow who can manipulate time, but who can't foretell some of the results. You can see the warm intelligence in his eyes.* Rachel McAdams (""The Vow"") is Mary, the object of his affections. This Canadian actress is no stranger to relationships with time travelers (""The Time Traveler's Wife""); but we laugh when her Mary insists she won't take her panties off for Scotland! (You'll love the scene.)* Bill Nighy (""Blow Dry"") is Bill's father. Dad is a cautious veteran of this phenomenon. This character is droll, wise, and a great father.* Lindsay Duncan (LOTS of British TV) Her sweetly ferocious Mum fooled me. I actually thought I was watching the French actress Julie Delpy!* Lydia Wilson (British TV) is Kit Kat, Tim's rambunctious sister who causes a LOT of turmoil.* Mitchell Mullen (""RED 2"") is Mary's father, Fitz, who is mentally out to lunch much of the time.The plot becomes fairly complex so it can become a challenge to follow if you have any hearing problems because much of it is either murmured or whispered. The script is witty and warm but there were times I needed captions; I know I'll LOVE my DVD!

I let go, and enjoyed the ride.And what a brilliant ride.Now from the writer of ""Black Adder"", ""Mister Bean"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""Notting Hill"", ""The Vicar of Dibley""and a resum&eacute; that one would kill to just have a part of, comes his newest: ""About Time""Yes, it's a rom com.  Get over it lads: you are in the hands of a master.And as with many masters, they tend to transcend genre.With lines of dialogue that are so smart and crisp that you get jealous that you hadn't said it yourself,and an intelligence, playfulness and joy that is so rare, this is a great film.Yes, you will laugh, you will cry and you will feel amazingly wonderful after you watch this film.Read the other reviews for story points, the things I will mention are mostly directed towards thosewho might question watching this lovely film.Number One: Bill Nighy!  Watching him in his lanky, liquid  ease is such a pleasure.  You are not sure ifyou want to be him, or to have him as your father (the part he plays in the film and core to a major theme).He is just a pure joy to watch.Number two: Domhnall Gleeson. To digress- one of the problems with Hugh Grant is that though absolutely charming,you tend to watch his bumbling and insecurities and almost love him for them, but then get shocked out of it bythinking ""He's too good looking to actually believe any of it"".  Well, though it is damning praise, Domnhnaill Gleesonhas as much wit and charming self deprecating insecurity but is ultimately more believable because he looksmore like the rest of us.  (I use Hugh Grant as a reference because he is a Curtis favorite with his fantastic turn in Curtis' ""4 Weddings"" andthe slightly less fantastic but still charming role in ""Notting Hill"" and another great part as Prime Minister in ""Love, Actually"").As usual, Curtis brings along a fantastic cast from the leads to all of the supporting cast.So, just adding my voice to the other good reviews.It's just a great film to watch so do it!(And the reason I gave it a 4 star rating is that you have to save 5 stars for the unimpeachable classics.

1626959,A369KP0JV77JYT,B00BEIYGK2,Jon,"[2, 3]","I liked the director as well as the actors in this movie so I decided to give it a rent.  It is definitely not like Curtis's previous feel-good love stories which we all so enjoy (Four Weddings and A Funeral, Notting Hill, Love Actually), and I'd read enough to know that going in, since, well, it's a movie that includes time travel!  But unfortunately to me the time travel aspect of this movie ended up feeling like less the message it seemed to want to convey (live in the moment, tenderly and enthusiastically), and more creepy to me.  I'll try to not use specifics so I don't spoil anything.Our hero, Tim Lake, basically has godlike powers you find out early on, wherein he can go back in time.  Interesting, imagine what he could do with such powers - expectations were thus high early on, and the humor was great at first too.  And then you see quickly how every time the guy acts at all, well, like himself (naturally kind but awkward), and lets life happen, he feels like he could have done better and goes back and changes it.  At first it is funny and kind of ""cute.""  But pretty soon it starts to feel creepy.Lake knows he can change the outcome of everything (with a couple limits) so in the absolute pursuit of companionship he basically stalks a couple women, then eliminates their free will by manipulating situations as he sees fit, though he doesn't necessarily always ""take advantage"" of them: with the first woman he does this with, the conclusion he comes to is interesting as things don't work out.  But then he sleeps with one person multiple times in a row in a single night by going back in time repeatedly, which quite frankly felt a bit misogynistic, which I'm sure Curtis did not intend, but it felt how it felt to me.My skin crawled a bit at times throughout this movie.  I was NOT expecting that when I first started this movie.  I had an open mind going in, and expected an interesting love story, but not one where it feels like the girl is manipulated and controlled the entire time, and has no free will with the broad strokes of her life.Frankly this could easily be a psychological-thriller movie: if Timmy doesn't like the girl's response, he just goes back in time and tinkers with a few things and comes back, and repeats until she does what he wants, says what he wants, and he is satisfied.This movie does have its genuinely funny, light-hearted, and also deep moments.  Death and alcoholism are touched upon well with regard to the time travel aspect.  Bill Nighy plays his part as Tim's father well.  But unfortunately for me at least, once Lake has completed his conquest and has a family, then the movie slows way down and is frankly a bit disappointingly-boring to me by the end.  His family were all likeable, but it was for me too easy to see them as characters that have all been done over and over and over.There were some very funny moments in the movie with the time travel, for instance when McAdams's character's parents arrive and he says something stupid, and other times where it was quite funny in the same way.  If the movie had ended with the guy going clear back to the beginning and letting fate happen by being himself naturally and letting others be themselves naturally (maybe having his character and McAdams's meet anyway), maybe that would've saved it for me.  But instead it seems like everyone who loves this movie is just fine with the fact a guy manipulated everyone in his life to get where and what he wanted, but because he seems like a jolly good fellow it's okay.Bottom-line: I was really excited to watch this movie, but after seeing it I wish I hadn't.  It was funny at first, then creepy, with random bits of gentleness to keep people from being too creeped out, I guess, which I guess worked for many viewers.  Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but there is no one I know that I would recommend seeing this movie to.I hope Curtis sticks to his proven happy stuff, with great dialogue, ensemble casts, generally nice scenery, and love prevailing freely.",2,"Disappointing movie, creepy and too slow at times",1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,4036,"['liked', 'director', 'as', 'well', 'actors', 'movie', 'so', 'decided', 'give', 'rent', 'definitely', 'not', 'Curtis', 'previous', 'feel-good', 'love', 'stories', 'so', 'enjoy', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'A', 'Funeral', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'Love', 'Actually', ""'d"", 'read', 'enough', 'know', 'going', 'well', 'movie', 'time', 'travel', 'unfortunately', 'time', 'travel', 'aspect', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'feeling', 'less', 'message', 'seemed', 'want', 'convey', 'live', 'moment', 'tenderly', 'enthusiastically', 'more', 'creepy', ""'ll"", 'try', 'not', 'use', 'specifics', 'do', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything.Our', 'hero', 'Tim', 'Lake', 'basically', 'godlike', 'powers', 'find', 'out', 'early', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'Interesting', 'imagine', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'such', 'powers', 'expectations', 'were', 'thus', 'high', 'early', 'humor', 'was', 'great', 'first', 'too', 'then', 'see', 'quickly', 'how', 'time', 'guy', 'well', 'naturally', 'kind', 'awkward', 'life', 'happen', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'back', 'first', 'funny', 'kind', 'cute', 'pretty', 'soon', 'feel', 'creepy.Lake', 'knows', 'can', 'change', 'outcome', 'everything', 'couple', 'limits', 'so', 'absolute', 'pursuit', 'companionship', 'basically', 'couple', 'women', 'then', 'free', 'will', 'manipulating', 'situations', 'fit', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'always', 'take', 'advantage', 'first', 'woman', 'conclusion', 'interesting', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'then', 'one', 'person', 'multiple', 'times', 'row', 'single', 'night', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'repeatedly', 'quite', 'frankly', 'felt', 'bit', 'misogynistic', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Curtis', 'did', 'not', 'intend', 'felt', 'how', 'felt', 'me.My', 'skin', 'crawled', 'bit', 'times', 'movie', 'was', 'NOT', 'expecting', 'when', 'first', 'started', 'movie', 'had', 'open', 'mind', 'going', 'expected', 'interesting', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'one', 'where', 'girl', 'manipulated', 'controlled', 'entire', 'time', 'free', 'will', 'broad', 'strokes', 'life.Frankly', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'psychological-thriller', 'movie', 'Timmy', ""n't"", 'like', 'girl', 'response', 'just', 'back', 'time', 'tinkers', 'few', 'things', 'back', 'repeats', 'what', 'what', 'satisfied.This', 'movie', 'have', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'light-hearted', 'also', 'deep', 'moments', 'Death', 'alcoholism', 'are', 'touched', 'upon', 'well', 'regard', 'time', 'travel', 'aspect', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'part', 'Tim', 'father', 'well', 'unfortunately', 'least', 'once', 'Lake', 'completed', 'conquest', 'family', 'then', 'movie', 'way', 'frankly', 'bit', 'disappointingly-boring', 'end', 'family', 'were', 'likeable', 'was', 'too', 'easy', 'see', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'were', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'movie', 'time', 'travel', 'instance', 'when', 'McAdams', 'character', 'parents', 'arrive', 'something', 'stupid', 'other', 'times', 'where', 'was', 'quite', 'funny', 'same', 'way', 'movie', 'had', 'ended', 'guy', 'going', 'clear', 'back', 'beginning', 'letting', 'fate', 'happen', 'being', 'naturally', 'letting', 'others', 'be', 'naturally', 'maybe', 'having', 'character', 'McAdams', 'meet', 'anyway', 'maybe', 'would', ""'ve"", 'saved', 'instead', 'everyone', 'who', 'movie', 'just', 'fine', 'fact', 'guy', 'manipulated', 'everyone', 'life', 'get', 'where', 'what', 'wanted', 'jolly', 'good', 'fellow', 'okay.Bottom-line', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'watch', 'movie', 'seeing', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'was', 'funny', 'first', 'then', 'creepy', 'random', 'bits', 'gentleness', 'keep', 'people', 'being', 'too', 'creeped', 'out', 'guess', 'guess', 'worked', 'many', 'viewers', 'Not', 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'know', 'would', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'movie', 'hope', 'Curtis', 'sticks', 'proven', 'happy', 'stuff', 'great', 'dialogue', 'ensemble', 'casts', 'generally', 'nice', 'scenery', 'love', 'prevailing', 'freely']",N/A

'About Time' is that wonderful, little, sleeper hit that went into the theaters and quietly snuck out but still ran away with plenty of cash to spare. It's that film that little remember having heard of when it was released, but now lies to be seen clearly on DVD, and so I rented and watched it. It's a romantic- dramedy starring type casted 'Rachel McAdams' of 'The Notebook' and 'The Vow' fame. Of course I'm not complaining she was made for these types of roles. The plot line was fairly simple and I thought knew how the film was going to play out, but then I was delightfully surprised when it actually surprised me. It fooled me in a good way. My review of 'About Time'.'About Time' tells the tale of a young and awkward British man by the name of Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) who is informed by his father (Bill Nighy) that the male in a long line of his ancestry has the ability to time travel, particularly to past events that the subject was involved in. Tim is beyond excited, his dream of which is to get a girlfriend. He continuously travels to the past to make his future better, along the way he meets the girl of his dreams, the one (Rachel McAdams) his pans re to improve their future by changing their past.By reading that plot line you'd assume that for the climax our lead, Tim would most likely make a horribly bad mistake in the past and change the future for the worst, and having to fix the wrong he had done in the past to make the future better, right? Nope, no drama, the film is just a light, warm, romance, whose ending is necessary and sweet. It's that fairytale ending just without the fairies. That's how delightful the film is to see. The scripting is nice, and while tense when it needs to be it never goes full out gloomy like that of 'The Notebook' and 'The Vow' everything in the end, is good. Nothing done to make the story sad, you still cry but its tears of joy. The script allows moments of pure wit, the film is funny in times that it needs to be and more serious when it needs to be. The film balances all aspects.The cast allows characters that are more one dimensional to become more fleshed out, real. I cannot imagine anyone else portraying out lead, Tim other then 'Domhnall Gleeson'. Gleeson is well comedically timed and wonderfully convincing as Tim, and shares great chemistry with the rom-dramedy reliable 'Rachel McAdams'. McAdams is sweet and smooth with Gleeson and their both lovingly compatible off each other. 'Bill Nighy' is a much welcomed co-star and screen stealer as always.But sometimes the film can't help but lag. There is too much, the film could have used a few cuts to better stream line itself more. At over 2 hours, the film feels overlong and sometimes you get an over dosage of sweetness, and you kind of start to get bored of it, as happy as the film is, it loses steam toward the end due to a lack of edited out scenes.All and All 'About Time' is a wonderfully cheerful film, with a great pare of leads including Domhnall Gleeson, Rachel McAdams, and Bill Nighy, and while the film is a bit overlong and the plotline a little under the fresh line, the film pumps on delightfully, and will leave you smiling till the end.

This movie is soooo much more than that, and you will be pleasantly surprised!First, I have to say that I think that writer and producer Richard Curtis is an absolute genius.  While his romantic comedies have the usual wide appeal and are predictably funny, they also have a depth and message not readily found in the genre.  The characters in his movies have an &#34;everyman&#34; appeal.  Well defined, intricate, relatable people that are endearing both in their strengths, and in their weaknesses....and the characters in this movie are no exception.While the beginning theme....an average looking British man trying to find love, is not that unusual, the story quickly turns to reveal a family &#34;gift&#34; that is bestowed on the male members of the unusual family.  The main character begins using this &#34;gift&#34; to try and get the girl, but through a maze of events and endearing characters, learns the real, enduring lesson contained in the gift.Sweet, poignant, funny and endearing...you will laugh, you will cry, and you will question.

I finally got around to seeing this little gem from Richard Curtis who directed one of my favorite films of any genre, ""Love Actually.""  Domhnall Gleeson, (soon to appear in the new Star Wars film) stars as Tim who lives in Cornwall with his dad (Bill Nighy), mother (Lindsay Duncan) and sister, Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson).Upon his 21st birthday, Dad tells Tim that he has inherited special powers that the men in his family have.  If he goes into a dark room, closes his eyes and clinches his fists he can travel back in time to any point and place within his lifetime.  It's a secret of course and Tim tends to use the power wisely.  There's no time machine involved, so the film is more fantasy than science fiction.  And there are other ""buts"" involved, but I'm not sure I ever caught on to what some of the forbidden tricks were.  No matter.Tim is still searching for his true love when he meets Mary (Rachel McAdams) and falls hard.  After a couple tries, he makes the right impression and they get married have kids and live almost happily ever after.  The film stays away from traditional falling in love scenes, but just plays out the couple's lives like most of us.  And by that I mean death enters the picture, and sibling problems and how to not forget the friends in your life.The movie isn't perfect.  For one thing, it's too long.  Perhaps Curtis could have cut back on one or two of Tim's do-overs.  You have to love the many one on ones scenes with Tim and the people in his life, but those with McAdams and Nighy are priceless.The Blu ray comes in a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The video is near perfection with excellent skintones and black levels.  Colors are muted a bit but seem perfect for this film.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is equally excellent.  The dialog is clear and easily understood.  The surroundings are effectively displayed although the surrounds don't usually come into play.  Some of the party scenes will bring them into action.  A modest but realistic soundfield.  Subtitles are available in English SDH, French and Spanish.

A film from Richard Curtis, 'Notting Hill', a lot about love, family, living life the right way, everyday.Tim Lake, played by Domhnall Gleeson, is living at home in Cornwall with his parents Bill Nighy, as dad and Lindsay Duncan, as his mother. Quite an eccentric family, including his sister Kit Kat, played by Lydia Wilson. He is just starting his professional life, he considers himself, &#34;too tall, too skinny and too orange&#34;, but to most of us, just right. Tim is leaving for London when his father tells him a family secret: Once they turn 21, the men in the family acquire the ability to travel back in time, a power that comes with its own logic and rules. This does seem like overkill, but it is the one true thing that holds this film together, other than the exquisite acting. Tim can go back to moments in his own life and become more sexy, and more sensitive.Tim meets the love of his life, Mary, played by Rachel McAdams, and off they go into life. The rest of the film seemed to overlong to me, rather sentimental, but quite lively, all in all. A good film for the family, over 15, and a good date night film. Any film with Bill Nighy is a good one.

I thought it would be a Romantic Comedy without really reading anything about it.  It does have romance in it and the same with comedy although not altogether, this has a really original concept behind it.  Kind of, if you only had one day left to live, how would you spend it?  This is not the theme of the movie at all, it was how I was viewing it after about the first fifteen minutes to half an hour.  What, or better said, who are the important people or situations that you should be indulging your time with?I found that the mundane things in life started to look not so mundane, but maybe taken for  granted; what we say, think, spend our time doing, where we go.  This movie got to the emotions in me and made me appreciate the life I have and why.  And, for me, a must own for my viewing library.  The scenery (John Guleserian) of England was gorgeous, and popped right off the screen added along with a sweet soundtrack (Nick Laird-Clowes) with its heart tugging songs just brought tears to my eyes at times.  I am never disappointed with the soundtracks chosen by Curtis. This also gives more atmosphere to the people oriented and uncomplicated story.  I found the more I went over the 'hows' and 'what ifs' of the story was merely myself trying to make it complicated, and took away from the sweet ride that it really is.Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) meets Mary (Rachel McAdams) in a quite unconventional way and immediately she is the love of his lifetime.  As simple as that.  His father (Bill Nighy) lets him know a bit previous to this that he has a special and unusual ability.

1627074,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00BEIYGK2,The People's Critic,"[0, 0]","The posters and trailers for About Time prominently tout that it is from &#8220;the creators of Love Actually, Notting Hill, and Four Weddings and a Funeral.&#8221;  While About Time is curiously missing an appearance by Hugh Grant, the film is absolutely deserving of being listed as an equal among those films.  It is a warm and heartfelt film that feels incredibly &#8220;Romantic&#8221; in every sense of the word.About Time stars Domhnall Gleeson, who American audiences know as Bill Weasley from the final two Harry Potter films, but not much else.  Gleeson, son of the great Irish actor, Brendan Gleeson, plays Tim, a name curiously similar to the principle word in the title, &#8220;Time.&#8221;  Thus, the movie is as much about Tim as it is about &#8220;time.&#8221;  On his 21st birthday, Tim is given the odd and unbelievable news from his father (Bill Nighy) that the men in his family have the ability to travel through time.  For a romantic comedy, it is surprising to see a plot resting so firmly on such an absurd and fantastic premise.  Yet, one must only look back 20 years to a little film called Groundhog Day, perhaps the greatest modern romantic comedy ever made, that succeeds due to a bizarre and unexplainable time rift that allows the film&#8217;s message to flourish and evolve!  About Time clearly tips its hat to the Harold Ramis classic in several humorous scenes where Tim bounces off to try and undo some foolishly embarrassing moments.But About Time is not at all subjugated by its premise.  Tim&#8217;s father asks him what he plans to do with his new gift, and the film is quite ideal in its treatment of such a power.  Tim decides that he will use it for love.  Thus, Tim moves out of his parents&#8217; house and strikes out for London where he will practice law and search for love.  He finds it in Mary (Rachel McAdams), an American publishing house editor working in London.  It is here that the movie firmly kicks into romantic gear.  While it successfully emphasizes the passion, beauty, and emotion of young love, the time travel element allows the film to search deeper into modern romanticism as Tim is able to slow down, explore the natural beauty of the world, experience the trials of the mind, free himself from the corrupting forces of society, and most importantly &#8211; discover how to make the most out of life.Director, Richard Curtis has made a beautiful film with About Time.  Elegant, cozy country-side scenes are balanced with busy but scenic city-scapes. Curtis gives London the Paris treatment, making it look far more inviting and relatable than other films have in the past.  But like all romantic comedies, the true magic lies in the chemistry of its leads.  Gleeson and McAdams are easy to root for, and their relationship is not hokey, nor does the film commit the cardinal sin of having Tim use his powers to manipulate Mary.  Instead, his power is used to create opportunities, but it is Tim that must make the most of them.  A fine example lies in the scene where Tim and Rachel first meet by happenstance.  Ironically this first meeting is in a restaurant called Dans Le Noir, a restaurant where diners sit in total darkness, an immersive experience that emphasizes the other senses and provides a clever way for Tim and Rachel to build the foundation for their relationship.  Soon, a mistake made by Tim during time travel causes this first meeting to be forgotten leading Tim to find a way to create a new opportunity to make an impression on Mary.  Now, that is not to say that Tim does not play &#8220;puppet-master&#8221; with other people&#8217;s lives, which is a bit off-putting.  Nonetheless, these minor valleys are certainly not enough to degrade the film&#8217;s peaks.The sentimentality of the film is authentic and while occasionally heavy-handed, it is quite effective.  The Tim and Mary story is central to the film, but Curtis as writer and director makes sure to develop the father-son relationship between Tim and his Dad.  It is in this relationship where most of the &#8220;heartstrings&#8221; are continually tugged upon.  Nighy&#8217;s inclusion in the story adds warmth but also some complexity as he too can travel through time.  The bond between the men, the shared experiences, and the lessons learned all work to make the film about more than just a love story.About Time is a pleasing and successful film that does not exploit its premise or undermine its characters.  Fans of romantic comedies (especially those of Curtis&#8217;s) will be satisfied and touched by this film.  B+About Time opens on November 8th, and has a running time of 2 hours and 3 minutes.  It is a beautiful and well-made film that would make an excellent date-night option in a fall movie season full of thrillers, action, and suspense.  It also accomplishes the dual task of making us forget about the other far more disappointing Rachel McAdams time travel romance, The Time Traveler&#8217;s Wife.",4,About Time,1387756800,"12 23,

1627075,AJ3DV8QYH84DJ,B00BEIYGK2,The Wolf,"[1, 2]","This is truly a wonderful movie.  Folks need to realize that this is not your typical romantic comedy...in fact, In not sure it could be classified as a comedy at all.  This is a film that is very heartwarming and touching at it's core.  I'll be the first to admit that some of the logistics about how the time travel aspect was used didn't really seem to be realistic....but come in, anything dealing with time travel can never truly be logistically sound.  But the fact is, this movie isn't really about time travel at all...that's just a very secondary part of the overall story.  This film is about the heart and the growth of the characters.  And in that aspect, this film was brilliantly written, brilliantly acted, and is simply a wonderful film to waste 2 hours on.As a side note, I want to give a special shout out to Bill Nighy.  I've always felt he was a truly brilliant actor, and personally feel he should receive more recognition for his brilliance.  This film truly showcases how wonderful of an actor he truly is.  Even though he wasn't the 'lead' actor in this film, he gave so much heart to this role, especially in the latter parts of the film, that I'm not sure it's possible to watch the end of this film and not have your eyes get a little misty.  All the actors give a wonderful performance, but Bill's performance was second to none.  It's amazing how in certain roles he can make us laugh our hind parts off, and in others he can make you get misty eyed as easily as he does here.  For me, that's the sign of a truly gifted actor....and Bill, hats off to you for helping to make this film special.If you want to watch a truly fine movie...you could do a lot worse than this fine film.",5,Brilliant Movie,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,1709,"['truly', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'Folks', 'need', 'realize', 'not', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'fact', 'not', 'sure', 'could', 'be', 'classified', 'comedy', 'film', 'very', 'heartwarming', 'touching', 'core', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'logistics', 'how', 'time', 'travel', 'aspect', 'was', 'used', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'be', 'realistic', '.but', 'come', 'anything', 'dealing', 'time', 'travel', 'can', 'never', 'truly', 'be', 'logistically', 'sound', 'fact', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'time', 'travel', 'just', 'very', 'secondary', 'part', 'overall', 'story', 'film', 'heart', 'growth', 'characters', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'film', 'waste', '2', 'hours', 'on.As', 'side', 'note', 'want', 'give', 'special', 'shout', 'Bill', 'Nighy', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'personally', 'feel', 'should', 'receive', 'more', 'recognition', 'brilliance', 'film', 'truly', 'how', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'truly', 'Even', 'was', ""n't"", ""'lead"", 'actor', 'film', 'gave', 'so', 'much', 'heart', 'role', 'especially', 'latter', 'parts', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'possible', 'watch', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'eyes', 'get', 'little', 'misty', 'actors', 'give', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Bill', 'performance', 'was', 'second', 'none', 'amazing', 'how', 'certain', 'roles', 'can', 'make', 'hind', 'parts', 'others', 'can', 'make', 'get', 'misty', 'eyed', 'as', 'easily', 'here', 'sign', 'truly', 'gifted', 'actor', '.and', 'Bill', 'helping', 'make', 'film', 'special.If', 'want', 'watch', 'truly', 'fine', 'movie', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'fine', 'film']",N/A
