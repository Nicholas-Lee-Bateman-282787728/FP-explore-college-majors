1641237,A3D2DJEHR4U7HC,B00BYS0XWC,"D. Hinson ""D. Hinson""","[6, 9]","I was really curious to see Jewel take on the iconic June Carter in this different take on her life and relationships before, and with Johnny.  I thought she showed great promise in the role, bringing emotional depth to a character who surely went through the proverbial ""ringer"" in her times with Cash.  The movie was touching without being schmaltzy, and in one scene in particular at the Betty Ford Clinic, Jewel really dug deep and displayed an acting ability that brought June's struggles directly to the heart.  For anyone who's grown up seeing a parent deal with the addiction of another, and all it entails, this scene will have particular resonance as June speaks to the isolation and anguish of constantly taking care of the other person, along with their children, whilst seemingly having nobody to rely upon to help tend to their own needs.  She reminded me of how much my own mother shouldered in dealing with my father's alcoholism when I was growing up.  The emotion I felt in that scene was quite unexpected, as I've seen this theme explored so many times on film without ever seeing someone really show the toll that it takes.  It made me want to pick up the phone and say ""thank you"" to Mom.I only give the movie 4 stars due to the fact that it could--and should--have been longer.  I totally understand why they did it as a two hour movie, but it could really have benefitted from being extended an hour or two--perhaps as a two parter--to cover more ground and give the actors more breathing room to fully establish their characters attraction to one another.  I felt that the film really skimmed the surface of the connection between June and Johnny (a very credible Matt Ross), which left one to connect the dots without much help.  The actors had good chemistry, which helped, so it's a minor caveat.Kudos to the wardrobe and set design departments as well for giving the look of the times just the right touch.  Jewel never looked more beautiful!

1641241,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BYS0XWC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[14, 14]","Considering that the June Carter biopic ""Ring of Fire"" was a Lifetime Original Movie, I didn't have particularly high expectations.  The network is best known for its lurid ""ripped from the headlines"" recreations of notorious crimes or its standard ""woman in peril"" thrillers.  It's always nice to see them strive for something a bit more noteworthy!  Coming up with the right balance in a dramatized biography can be a tricky proposition.  Someone's life is far too complex to be covered with any depth in a ninety minute presentation.  Director Allison Anders and screenwriter Richard Friedenberg do a nice job in conveying the essence of June Carter with the material they've chosen to include in ""Ring of Fire.""  Yes, the movie is episodic and skips enormous chunks of Carter's life.  But what it does provide is a solid entertainment.  The performances are good, the emotions heartfelt, and the soundtrack is peppered with lots of recognizable music.  So while this isn't going to be the definitive word on Miss June Carter Cash, it is heads and tails above traditional Lifetime fare.The movie opens with June as a youth.  As a child, she suffered from stage fright and insecurity in performing.  But she liked the adulation, and soon discovered her calling with a quick wit and a playful sass.  We don't get too much of the grown June (now played by singer Jewel Kilcher) as an independent woman.  Her first failed relationships get relatively minor play as the movie attempts to get to ole Johnny Cash (Matt Ross) as soon as possible.  Kilcher and Ross display an easy chemistry in both the good times and the bad.  As they unite, it is sweet and flirtatious.  But Cash is a challenge, to say the least, and the courtship through the marriage include a fair share of tumult.  Most of the screenplay deals with Cash's substance abuse and its effect on the family.  There is nothing particularly new or revelatory in this presentation of the couple's struggle, but it is well done and well acted.  After dealing with this unpleasantness, the film than fast forwards to the end of Carter's life.  As I mentioned, there are HUGE gaps but I enjoyed ""Ring of Fire"" for what it was.Perhaps the biggest (and most pleasant) surprise was Jewel.  Relatively inexperienced as an actress, she is given a very meaty role here.  Although she wouldn't be mistaken for the real Carter, she does very well in showcasing both the humor and the strength within the character.  As the material gets serious, she handles the emotional confrontations well.  Ross is equally impressive as Cash, although we don't really learn much about him.  Frances Conroy is also appropriately understated as Carter's mother.  Overall, the performances are pretty impressive.  By its nature, ""Ring of Fire"" may not fully uncover its subject.  If you are a fan of Johnny and June Carter Cash, you probably won't learn anything new.  But I still suspect that you'll find this a worthwhile entertainment.  And it's filled with great music!

1641246,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B00BYS0XWC,Tony Heck,"[6, 7]","""I fell for you like a child, oh but the fire went wild."" June Carter (Jewel) is a member of country musics most famous family. After two failed marriages and a succesful music career she finally gives in and marries country's bad boy, Johnny Cash (Ross). She then starts her new life singing, playing, raising kids and trying to keep Johnny clean. Some prove more difficult then others. Just about everyone know the story of these two icons. I am a huge Johnny Cash fan and even though this was a Lifetime movie I was still looking forward to seeing it. I do have to admit that Jewel did a pretty good job of playing June in this but no where close to how good Reese Witherspoon was. As far as the guy playing Johnny Cash...it would have been hard to even come close to Joaquin Phoenix but this guy was just bad. His acting was OK, but he looked and sounded nothing like him. In fact the whole movie I thought the guy looks more like Merle Haggard then Johnny Cash. As far as the actual movie ""Walk The Line"" dealt with Cash's drug problems fairly harsh but also had the music mixed in. This movie is more of a bio-pic of June Carter, but it's pretty much her helping Johnny get sober over and over. I know it's Lifetime and it does show how strong June was, but after the third scene of her telling Johnny he has to stop it becomes very repetitive and really starts to lose some of the emotion. Do not be like me and go in expecting a Johnny Cash movie with music, that's not what this is. Overall, Jewel does a good job but this is nothing like I expected.
