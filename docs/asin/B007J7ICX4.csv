I was expecting the dialogue to be in English with German sub-titles or in German with English sub-titles.  It had been dubbed into German with no subtitles.  So unless you understand German really well, you don't want this.I liked the actual film when I saw it - about rich high school kids who horribly abuse a girl in their throw-away society.  Not especially original or well written, but worth a view.",3,Beware - Dubbed Into German with no Subtitles,1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,519,"['saw', 'Australian', 'film', 'film', 'festival', 'liked', 'enough', 'purchase', 'German', 'import', 'home', 'viewing', 'was', 'expecting', 'dialogue', 'be', 'English', 'German', 'sub-titles', 'German', 'English', 'sub-titles', 'had', 'been', 'dubbed', 'German', 'subtitles', 'So', 'understand', 'German', 'really', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'this.I', 'liked', 'actual', 'film', 'when', 'saw', 'rich', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'who', 'horribly', 'abuse', 'girl', 'throw-away', 'society', 'Not', 'especially', 'original', 'well', 'written', 'view']",Wasted on the Young [Blu-ray]
1531759,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B007J7ICX4,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","{3.5 stars}WASTED ON THE YOUNG is a violent, disturbing, low-budget Australian film whose plot and conflict are a bit similar to ""Betrayed at 17"" but go to lengths far beyond those of the Lifetime B-17. While it focuses mainly on the very darkest aspects of adolescence, it's pretty and sadly moving in a few spots, and the acting/ characterization are undeniably real. WY also has a touch of the artsy and the surreal; it does a nice job of meshing certain characters' fantasies with their realities. Another interesting aspect of this film is how, although a few sparse adult voices are heard, the only visible characters are the teenagers, something I haven't seen anywhere outside of ""Charlie Brown.""The pace of WY often plods, particularly in the middle, and the scope is limited almost exclusively to the teenagers' school and homes. Those qualities, along with the fact that WY's just generally a real downer, will obviously not appeal to some tastes. Others will find, as I did, that its better, more unique qualities make it a memorable and worthwhile experience.",4,"""We are trapped in a bubble while the rest of the world keeps turning""",1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,1072,"['3.5', 'stars', 'WASTED', 'ON', 'THE', 'YOUNG', 'violent', 'disturbing', 'low-budget', 'Australian', 'film', 'plot', 'conflict', 'are', 'bit', 'similar', 'Betrayed', '17', 'go', 'lengths', 'far', 'Lifetime', 'B-17', 'mainly', 'very', 'darkest', 'aspects', 'adolescence', 'pretty', 'sadly', 'moving', 'few', 'spots', 'acting/', 'characterization', 'are', 'undeniably', 'real', 'WY', 'also', 'touch', 'artsy', 'surreal', 'nice', 'job', 'meshing', 'certain', 'characters', 'fantasies', 'realities', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'film', 'how', 'few', 'sparse', 'adult', 'voices', 'are', 'heard', 'only', 'visible', 'characters', 'are', 'teenagers', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anywhere', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'pace', 'WY', 'often', 'plods', 'particularly', 'middle', 'scope', 'limited', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'teenagers', 'school', 'homes', 'qualities', 'fact', 'WY', 'just', 'generally', 'real', 'downer', 'will', 'obviously', 'not', 'appeal', 'tastes', 'Others', 'will', 'find', 'did', 'better', 'more', 'unique', 'qualities', 'make', 'memorable', 'worthwhile', 'experience']",Wasted on the Young [Blu-ray]

It's a shame too, because the basic premise is compelling and the lead actress is quite good. Unfortunately the director was more interested in giving the film an ""edgy"" and ""contemporary"" style --- failing miserably, as the style sucked --- than in telling a good story ( developing the characters, developing the relationship between the boy and girl, building tension, etc.)",2,"Not Very Good, Unfortunately",1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,442,"['Poorly', 'filmed', 'poorly', 'told', 'movie', 'was', 'frustratingly', 'bad', 'shame', 'too', 'basic', 'premise', 'compelling', 'lead', 'actress', 'quite', 'good', 'Unfortunately', 'director', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'giving', 'film', 'edgy', 'contemporary', 'style', 'failing', 'miserably', 'style', 'sucked', 'telling', 'good', 'story', 'developing', 'characters', 'developing', 'relationship', 'boy', 'girl', 'building', 'tension', 'etc']",Wasted on the Young [Blu-ray]

Darren (Oliver Ackland) is a computer robot junkie who lives in the shadow of his cooler step brother Zack (Alex Russell) who thinks very highly of himself. Xandrie (Adelaide Clemens) is a cutie who is &#34;crushing on Darren.&#34; She attends a party filled with alcohol and drugs in hopes of spending some time with Darren. She passes out and spends time with everyone but Darren as our tale of innocent love becomes a tale of vengeance.The film has some good scenes and a good ending. The characters didn't hook you as we got to know the bad guys better than the good guys. Darren was poorly written. The dialouge could have been better and the wanna-be relationship between our two main heroes is shown as a fleeting flashback and isn't well developed. It is drama/ thriller that could have been scripted better.Parental Guide: F-bomb, male nudity. Deals with drugs and rape.",3,"YOU CAN STOP THIS,",1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,939,"['nice', 'private', 'High', 'School', 'rich', 'kids', 'are', 'indulgent', 'Darren', 'Oliver', 'Ackland', 'computer', 'robot', 'junkie', 'who', 'shadow', 'cooler', 'step', 'brother', 'Zack', 'Alex', 'Russell', 'who', 'very', 'highly', 'Xandrie', 'Adelaide', 'Clemens', 'cutie', 'who', '34', 'crushing', 'Darren.', '34', 'party', 'filled', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'hopes', 'spending', 'time', 'Darren', 'out', 'spends', 'time', 'everyone', 'Darren', 'tale', 'innocent', 'love', 'tale', 'vengeance.The', 'film', 'good', 'scenes', 'good', 'ending', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'hook', 'got', 'know', 'bad', 'guys', 'better', 'good', 'guys', 'Darren', 'was', 'poorly', 'written', 'dialouge', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'wanna-be', 'relationship', 'two', 'main', 'heroes', 'shown', 'fleeting', 'flashback', ""n't"", 'well', 'developed', 'drama/', 'thriller', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'scripted', 'better.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bomb', 'male', 'nudity', 'Deals', 'drugs', 'rape']",Wasted on the Young [Blu-ray]
