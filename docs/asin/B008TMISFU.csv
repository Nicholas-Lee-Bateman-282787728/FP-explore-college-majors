I have to admit, however, operation Antarctica just did not grab me as previous DVD compilations (i.e. I was a penguin zombie!, New to the Zoo, Operation DVD). The characters were still funny, but I felt that the stories picked for the compilation were not as strong as in previous offerings. We've watched the other movies many times over, but Antarctica only once or twice.",4,The penguins are still great!

They make me laugh.  The writers need to keep producing these stories since old and young alike are into them for fun.  The black and white boys know how to have a good time.  In this story, Hunter, the sea pup, is the main character with the penguin team coming to the rescue.  Buy the film and take the journey with the boys and Hunter and find out what happens in the end since seals like penguins for snacks.  As always,  a hoot with some great characters such as King Julien, the Lemur King XIII, who is a stowaway on the submarine and know it all Kowalski, one of the penguins.",5,Penguins Are Where It's At!,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,688,"['have', 'one', 'films', 'Penguins', 'Madagascar', 'watch', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'month', 'make', 'writers', 'need', 'keep', 'producing', 'stories', 'old', 'young', 'alike', 'are', 'fun', 'black', 'white', 'boys', 'know', 'how', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'story', 'Hunter', 'sea', 'pup', 'main', 'character', 'penguin', 'team', 'coming', 'rescue', 'Buy', 'film', 'take', 'journey', 'boys', 'Hunter', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'end', 'seals', 'penguins', 'snacks', 'always', 'hoot', 'great', 'characters', 'such', 'King', 'Julien', 'Lemur', 'King', 'XIII', 'who', 'stowaway', 'submarine', 'know', 'Kowalski', 'one', 'penguins']",N/A
