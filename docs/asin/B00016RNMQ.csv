794375,AQZRCGSI9CNJU,B00016RNMQ,"AJ ""hattergal""","[10, 10]","If you like Henry Rollins, you will like this video. It is just him doing his usual humor mixed with a healthy dose of philosophy and opinion. If you are easily offended by foul language, religious discussions... well actually, if you are easily offended by anything, then this is definitely not the DVD for you. Rollins has an excellent ability to put into words human quirks and those frustrating things that happen in daily life, as he does here with his commentary on driving, where all I could think was &quot;Yep- that is it exactly!&quot;. He also discusses growing up with Fugazi musician Ian, and the antics when they worked together such as &quot;Human Sundaes&quot; (there is one bit about flinging dead fish that is very funny). Other bits include stories about his travels including short sturdy women with mustaches on the Moscow subway, riding through traffic in Cairo, and visting the Wailing Wall in Israel. When he takes a serious turn, uses some time to talk about his philosophy on drugs and drinking and why destroying your body makes no sense. One of my favorite parts of this DVD was actually the Bonus Scene where he talkes about his deep need to out-rock Iggy Pop at a series of concerts. Another really amusing section is when he reads aloud a broken-English letter from a fan from the Czech republic. He shows the humor in it without demeaning or insulting the writer.  I have seen his stand-up be funnier at times, but I can completely recommend this DVD. It is just laugh out loud funny, and both the humor and the philosophy are honest and thought-provoking.",5,Great Humor,1076976000,"02 17, 2004",2004,1588,"['like', 'Henry', 'Rollins', 'will', 'like', 'video', 'just', 'doing', 'usual', 'humor', 'mixed', 'healthy', 'dose', 'philosophy', 'opinion', 'are', 'easily', 'offended', 'foul', 'language', 'religious', 'discussions', 'well', 'actually', 'are', 'easily', 'offended', 'anything', 'then', 'definitely', 'not', 'DVD', 'Rollins', 'excellent', 'ability', 'put', 'words', 'human', 'quirks', 'frustrating', 'things', 'happen', 'daily', 'life', 'here', 'commentary', 'driving', 'where', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'quot', 'Yep-', 'exactly', 'quot', 'also', 'growing', 'up', 'Fugazi', 'musician', 'Ian', 'antics', 'when', 'worked', 'together', 'such', 'quot', 'Human', 'Sundaes', 'quot', 'one', 'bit', 'flinging', 'dead', 'fish', 'very', 'funny', 'Other', 'bits', 'include', 'stories', 'travels', 'including', 'short', 'sturdy', 'women', 'mustaches', 'Moscow', 'subway', 'riding', 'traffic', 'Cairo', 'visting', 'Wailing', 'Wall', 'Israel', 'When', 'serious', 'turn', 'time', 'talk', 'philosophy', 'drugs', 'drinking', 'why', 'destroying', 'body', 'sense', 'One', 'favorite', 'parts', 'DVD', 'was', 'actually', 'Bonus', 'Scene', 'where', 'deep', 'need', 'out-rock', 'Iggy', 'Pop', 'series', 'concerts', 'really', 'amusing', 'section', 'when', 'aloud', 'broken-English', 'letter', 'fan', 'Czech', 'republic', 'humor', 'demeaning', 'insulting', 'writer', 'have', 'seen', 'stand-up', 'be', 'funnier', 'times', 'can', 'completely', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'just', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'humor', 'philosophy', 'are', 'honest', 'thought-provoking']",N/A

The DVD is culled from a few different performances over a month's span at Luna Park.  From beginning to end, this DVD showcases Rollins' intensity, compassion, and humor.  Everything he releases, whether it be spoken word projects or Rollins Band albums, is incredible.  Rollins' material here, like all of his work, makes you think, laugh and is always worth a second or third watch.Check this DVD out if you are a Rollins' fan or even if you've never heard of him.  Hank is just about the most honest, interesting, and funniest performer working today.  You won't be disappointed.

After watching it.....all I can say is that Henry Rollins, even though he is a punker to certain extents,....Live at Luna Park will leave you laughing from beginning to end.  Some of the material on the DVD is taken from some of his CD's (Rollins in the Wry being one of them...a bit revamped but still in the same vein), but again it is still funny.  If you ever happen to come across Henry Rollins either live or a spoken word/comedy CD....get it...listen...laugh.  It's like being in a massive train wreck with carnage all about you and you are standing there laughing at it because somewhere....a person is able to take some of the ugliness and make light of everything.",5,FUNNY!!!,1115337600,"05 6, 2005",2005,737,"['came', 'pure', 'luck', 'chance', 'had', 'get', 'watching', '..all', 'can', 'say', 'Henry', 'Rollins', 'even', 'punker', 'certain', 'extents', '.Live', 'Luna', 'Park', 'will', 'leave', 'laughing', 'beginning', 'end', 'material', 'DVD', 'taken', 'CD', 'Rollins', 'Wry', 'being', 'one', 'bit', 'revamped', 'still', 'same', 'vein', 'again', 'still', 'funny', 'ever', 'happen', 'come', 'Henry', 'Rollins', 'live', 'spoken', 'word/comedy', 'CD', '.get', 'laugh', 'being', 'massive', 'train', 'wreck', 'carnage', 'are', 'standing', 'there', 'laughing', 'somewhere', '.a', 'person', 'able', 'take', 'ugliness', 'make', 'light', 'everything']",N/A

Stories invoked with unique brand of humor that blur the line between historical fact and comedy. More than interesting tales involving events relevant to music and entertainment and its subculture. Thanks to Rollins again for a life lived that is so fufilled that listening to its highlights is a great investment and worth visiting with friends.,5,Rollins on cue,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,480,"['excellent', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'spoken', 'word', 'performance', 'Rollins', 'delivery', 'held', 'previous', 'talking', 'box', 'standard', 'Stories', 'invoked', 'unique', 'brand', 'humor', 'line', 'historical', 'fact', 'comedy', 'More', 'interesting', 'tales', 'involving', 'events', 'relevant', 'music', 'entertainment', 'subculture', 'Thanks', 'Rollins', 'again', 'life', 'lived', 'so', 'fufilled', 'listening', 'highlights', 'great', 'investment', 'worth', 'visiting', 'friends']",N/A
