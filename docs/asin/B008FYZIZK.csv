It's great to see his scowl again in these old fashioned movies as Charlie kicks butt without blinking an eye or hardly working up a sweat.  Brings back a lot of memories!  A must for Chuck Bronson fans.  Wish he was still around to work his magic.

1552081,A134TLRMMNP8IL,B008FYZIZK,"F. P. Dunbar ""Renaissance Man""","[5, 5]","Years ago I recorded ""10 to Midnight"" from cable. The picture quality even of the original on cable was not very good; so, I took a gamble that the DVD might be better and bought it from Amazon. I lucked out: the picture quality is very good. These two movies are typical Golan Globus: the plots are not hackneyed, but spicy, sexy with mild perversions but not dwelled on offensively with women's breasts constantly hanging out; for the era probably pushing the envelope. Gene Davis, who also appeared in ""Cruising"" does an excellent job. I don't know why he doesn't get at least second billing. These movies are not so bad that they are good like ""Toxic Avenger."" In my prior reviews I forgot to add ""Avenger."" They are both refreshing and have spawned many imitations by filmmakers with no imaginations.",4,Vintage Golan Globus,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,805,"['Years', 'ago', 'recorded', '10', 'Midnight', 'cable', 'picture', 'quality', 'even', 'original', 'cable', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'so', 'took', 'gamble', 'DVD', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'bought', 'Amazon', 'lucked', 'out', 'picture', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'typical', 'Golan', 'Globus', 'plots', 'are', 'not', 'hackneyed', 'spicy', 'sexy', 'mild', 'perversions', 'not', 'dwelled', 'offensively', 'women', 'breasts', 'constantly', 'hanging', 'out', 'era', 'probably', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'Gene', 'Davis', 'who', 'also', 'appeared', 'Cruising', 'excellent', 'job', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', ""n't"", 'get', 'least', 'second', 'billing', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'are', 'good', 'Toxic', 'Avenger', 'prior', 'reviews', 'forgot', 'add', 'Avenger', 'are', 'refreshing', 'have', 'spawned', 'many', 'imitations', 'filmmakers', 'imaginations']",N/A
