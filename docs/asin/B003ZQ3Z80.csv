1377626,A2S29EES9TA9ZM,B003ZQ3Z80,hredzak,"[0, 0]","I saw this back in 2010 when it first came out and had some mixed feelings about it.  I mostly love all things BBC and I certainly wasn't disappointed by the acting, costumes, and setting.  But the theme of losing the woman who makes you passionate-crazy to an old fat rich dude for the sake of fitting in to society was more than a little depressing.  That, and I didn't care much for the casting.When I watched it again over the holidays, I appreciated it much more.  I still hate some of the casting, and it's way too short, but I feel differently about the theme now.  And Anne Lister is just a fascinating woman to learn about.This bio is a snapshot in the life of Anne Lister (1791-1840), and is based on her many diaries which were partially written in a complicated code of Greek letters and algebraic expressions.  She was a landowner and a shameless lesbian who remained unmarried and lived an independent lifestyle in 19th century Yorkshire when women just didn't do these things (it's the time of Jane Austen).  She never catered to the societal constraints of her time and she was very smart and an ambitious businesswoman.This bit of her life chronicles her passionate and heartbreaking relationship with Mariana Belcombe who is beautiful, alluring, and returns Anne's love mutually.  She's the prettiest actress cast here (not even close to an L Word cast in looks), but I struggled to like her because she starred in Affinity (by Sarah Waters) and was not a likable lead... and Affinity kinda sucked. Eventually, I came to think the casting reflected Lister's obsession for Mariana because no one else could compare and I accepted it for what it was.Unlike Lister, Mariana doesn't believe two women can live independently together and she marries hoping she can still keep Lister on the side.  Lister is traumatized but too bullheaded to accept this and ultimately finds another.  Initially, I didn't like the loss and cynicism that led her to settle for someone she wasn't passionate about.  But I recognized the maturity and character growth in doing so and I liked her more for that in the end.If you read up on the real Lister or watch the DVD extras, you'll learn she was very dykey looking and grew to be very butch with age... she even had some serious facial hair. Mariana was ashamed to be seen with her in public and people in town nicknamed her Gentleman Jack. I just think the casting could have reflected that much more.  The actress who played her was very talented and certainly embodied the arrogance and predatory qualities Lister is said to have... but not so much the butch or seductive charm.  She was mostly pushy, self-absorbed, and unlikable.This role called for a sexy butch. But heck, I wouldn't have complained with an actual L Word type cast. Nice introduction of a fascinating woman... just not enough depth, charm, or eye candy here to be a solid hit.",4,weak casting but Lister was a very interesting woman,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,2896,"['saw', 'back', '2010', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'mostly', 'love', 'things', 'BBC', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'acting', 'costumes', 'setting', 'theme', 'losing', 'woman', 'who', 'passionate-crazy', 'old', 'fat', 'rich', 'dude', 'sake', 'fitting', 'society', 'was', 'more', 'little', 'depressing', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'casting.When', 'watched', 'again', 'holidays', 'appreciated', 'much', 'more', 'still', 'hate', 'casting', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'feel', 'differently', 'theme', 'now', 'Anne', 'Lister', 'just', 'fascinating', 'woman', 'learn', 'about.This', 'bio', 'snapshot', 'life', 'Anne', 'Lister', '1791-1840', 'based', 'many', 'diaries', 'were', 'partially', 'written', 'complicated', 'code', 'Greek', 'letters', 'algebraic', 'expressions', 'was', 'landowner', 'shameless', 'lesbian', 'who', 'remained', 'unmarried', 'lived', 'independent', 'lifestyle', '19th', 'century', 'Yorkshire', 'when', 'women', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'things', 'time', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'never', 'catered', 'societal', 'constraints', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'smart', 'ambitious', 'businesswoman.This', 'bit', 'life', 'passionate', 'heartbreaking', 'relationship', 'Mariana', 'Belcombe', 'who', 'beautiful', 'alluring', 'Anne', 'love', 'mutually', 'prettiest', 'actress', 'cast', 'here', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'L', 'Word', 'cast', 'looks', 'struggled', 'like', 'starred', 'Affinity', 'Sarah', 'Waters', 'was', 'not', 'likable', 'lead', 'Affinity', 'kinda', 'sucked', 'Eventually', 'came', 'think', 'casting', 'reflected', 'Lister', 'obsession', 'Mariana', 'one', 'else', 'could', 'compare', 'accepted', 'what', 'Lister', 'Mariana', ""n't"", 'believe', 'two', 'women', 'can', 'live', 'independently', 'together', 'hoping', 'can', 'still', 'keep', 'Lister', 'side', 'Lister', 'traumatized', 'too', 'bullheaded', 'accept', 'ultimately', 'Initially', 'did', ""n't"", 'loss', 'cynicism', 'led', 'settle', 'someone', 'was', ""n't"", 'passionate', 'recognized', 'maturity', 'character', 'growth', 'doing', 'so', 'liked', 'more', 'end.If', 'read', 'up', 'real', 'Lister', 'watch', 'DVD', 'extras', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'was', 'very', 'dykey', 'looking', 'grew', 'be', 'very', 'butch', 'age', 'even', 'had', 'serious', 'facial', 'hair', 'Mariana', 'was', 'ashamed', 'be', 'seen', 'public', 'people', 'town', 'nicknamed', 'Gentleman', 'Jack', 'just', 'think', 'casting', 'could', 'have', 'reflected', 'much', 'more', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'was', 'very', 'talented', 'certainly', 'embodied', 'arrogance', 'predatory', 'qualities', 'Lister', 'said', 'have', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'butch', 'seductive', 'charm', 'was', 'mostly', 'pushy', 'self-absorbed', 'unlikable.This', 'role', 'called', 'sexy', 'butch', 'heck', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'complained', 'actual', 'L', 'Word', 'type', 'cast', 'Nice', 'introduction', 'fascinating', 'woman', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'depth', 'charm', 'eye', 'candy', 'here', 'be', 'solid', 'hit']",The Secret Diaries of Miss Anne Lister [Regions 2 & 4]

She is watching her friends from a distance through a spyglass and she is excited to see them particularly her lover and friend Mariana Belcombe.  Anna is lesbian in a time when homosexuality is not tolerated.  She is later shocked that day when it is announced that Mariana announces that she is getting married to an older and obviously not attractive man for financial reasons.  Anne is crushed and her life is in turmoil.Anne Lister is a wealthy heiress to the estate known as Shibden Hall which is her family estate.  She lives with her aunt and uncle in the family home and none of them have ever been married.  Anne attends the wedding of Mariana and wears black to the wedding.  She looks like she is going to a funeral.  Anne is so mad she walks all the way home crying.  She is depressed and she is not eating properly. She realizes that she has to forget about Mariana.  She devotes her time to reading studying and preparing to write a book.  She writes her diary every day and some of it is in code....This is a true story about strong willed woman who is a lesbian long before it was culturally accepted.  She has lost the love of her life and has to overcome the loss which is primarily due to the persecution that they would face if they were openly together.  She is already called Freddie by her lover and Gentleman Jack by the people in town.  Despite her troubled life she leads a role in developing a coal mining operation on her extensive estate property and meets up with another wealthy woman who also owns an estate and wants to be with Anne.All of her life she kept a diary and about 1/6 of the pages were written in a code.  Anne was a scholar in ancient Greek and mathematics and her code was only broken 150 years after her death.  This is an excellent story of how she stood up for her rights and made a life for herself.  The movie was very good and well-acted out and it is an excellent DVD release from BBC Home Entertainment.

1377629,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003ZQ3Z80,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 11]","I'm not going to sugar coat my reaction to BBC's ""The Secret Diaries of Miss Anne Lister."" As this handsome production began, I absolutely hated it! As we meet the central character in the opening sequences, she is portrayed as one of the most obnoxious women ever! Most, if not all, of my initial reaction is based on the fact that we're plopped down in the middle of a story with very little context. In real life, Anne Lister was a fascinating person who challenged conventional society by opening declaring herself as a lesbian. She was also an astute business woman, a daring adventurer and an accomplished academic. But as the telefilm doesn't go into much depth about these pursuits, I won't either. In the beginning, ""The Secret Diaries of Miss Anne Lister"" seems to want to position itself as a frothy sex comedy. Anne is predatory, unconcerned about anything but her own agenda, and dismissive of others. And yet, the screenplay seems to think we'll find her charming. I, myself, did not. It doesn't help that there has been no character development to help explain her behavior. I didn't feel as if the movie wanted me to know or understand our heroine, simply accept her unconditionally.But just as I had all but written off the movie as a missed opportunity, it started to become a bit more focused. As Anne becomes committed to the love of her life, she starts to clarify as a character. Maxine Peake really throws herself into this performance, and as the film progresses--she has numerous scenes where she's allowed to really go wild. It's both bold and fearless. As Anne becomes obsessive, jealous, and disillusioned by this relationship (the object of her affection has married another), Peake turns the unpleasant characterization from the beginning of the movie into a far more complex creation. While I didn't care for the first third of this ninety minute production, I really enjoyed its conclusion. It's a shame that the screenplay was so uneven and so single-minded. I still think that there is a great movie to be made about Lister, this just focuses on a relatively small aspect of her life.If you're interested in the subject matter, I'd certainly give this a qualified recommendation. I'm not familiar with Peake as an actress, but I liked her fiery spirit and would love to see her in something else. If at the end of ""The Secret Diaries of Miss Anne Lister,"" you still find her rather enigmatic (I sure did)--there is a nice Bonus feature that discusses the real Lister. Also included is Peake in conversation with the director, James Kent. Both of these extras provide additional insight, I just wished the film itself was stronger as a whole. It started at about 2 1/2 stars and ended at 4 stars. Flawed, but still fascinating, I wanted to love it but still felt it needed more of what made the real Lister so intriguing.

Initially, I was not sure if I would be engaged by a story that focuses on lesbian themes, but Anne Lister's powerful story was captivating to say the least and her emotional struggles seemed very real and human to me. I received the DVD courtesy of BBC America and am glad to have obtained some illuminating insights into the story of this remarkable woman who was quite a revolutionary for her time. It is based on the true story of Anne Lister, a landowner, pioneer industrialist, a savvy businesswoman, and a woman who was openly lesbian.Anne Lister is a wealthy orphan residing in 19th century Yorkshire with her aunt and uncle. The story focuses on Anne's relationships, primarily her life-long love affair with Marianna BelcombeMasterpiece Theatre - Secret Life of Mrs. Beetonand as the insufferable Lucy Steele inSense & Sensibility / Miss Austen Regrets) . Anne (portrayed in a powerful performance by Maxine Peake) is utterly shattered when Marianna's family announce her engagement to wealthy older widower Charles Lawton. Anne begs Marianna to reconsider and to marry her (Anne) instead, but Marianna is adamant,deciding to honor her family's wishes and consoles Anne saying that they can still meet occasionally and be together when time permits. A year goes by with no word from Marianna, and the despondent Anne throws herself into scholarship and minor love affairs (though I read elsewhere that she went through many more love affairs than those depicted on screen).Anne is very much like a man in voicing her opinions - she is outspoken and even dresses in an unfeminine manner, choosing dark colors and going for comfortable, asexual clothes rather than vanity. She has a brilliant mind, and pours her heart out in her journals, written in code so that no one else can read them, except for some very intimate friends. These very same journals were discovered in Shibden Hall (where Anne lived) 150 years after her death (she died at the age of 49 while hiking through the Caucasus Mountains in 1840).The story is in essence about a woman's struggles to be true to herself and fulfill the desires of her heart in a world which was very unforgiving and socially conservative, a world that frowned upon lesbians, and made life difficult for those that dared defy social conventions. I must warn that the sexual scenes are quite explicit, and there's lots of nudity though I also felt the scenes were restrained, focusing on the passion and natural affection between the women than exploitative. Even though I'm a heterosexual woman, I empathized with Anne's plight and her frustrations at not being able to be with the love of her life. Anne Lister is a sympathetic character yet her indomitable spirit inspired me for she possessed a truly 'natural' character (as one woman characterizes Anne), one who dared to defy conventions and be true to her real nature.
