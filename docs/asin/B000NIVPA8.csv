1057067,A1OA4MKLDGV3GT,B000NIVPA8,BooksandMoviesLover,"[2, 4]","As many V.C. Andrews fans know, this is based on the book of the same name.  The book wasn't all that great, in my opinion.  It was written by Andrew Neiderman, the ghost writer for V.C. Andrews (V.C.A. has been dead now for 20 years).  Neiderman also wrote the screenplay for this movie.  I feel he butchered his own story, and the story wasn't all that wonderful to begin with.  Many fans will know that even the book was a retread of previous series he wrote under V.C. Andrews name, only with a black lead character.  I say this so everybody knows the history behind this movie.  I do not recommend the book if you haven't read it.This movie was of poor quality. It didn't have much of a point. The point was pretty much how Rain rises to the top and pleases the rich grandma she never knew she had until recently. This is supposed to be emotionally affecting because Rain's of mixed race and comes from a poor background. Her grandmother's white and wealthy.  I found the message simplistic, actually. There have been movies that have carried off such a message well.  This one doesn't.  It just doesn't try hard enough at all to get you invested in the characters.  This movie could have been a whole lot better. A movie can be cliche and still have a twist or enough heart to keep you hooked. This movie doesn't even manage that. Here's the basic plot:Rain finds out she's adopted, then her sister is murdered by gang members and her life is in danger so she has to live with her real grandmother. Her grandmother looks down on her at first, but then she starts to warm to her when she sees what great posture she has and how nicely she dresses. She's also polite and well-behaved.  Rain is musically inclined so Grandma enrolls her in a music school.  Meanwhile, the gang members  are trying to hunt Rain down.Then there's Corbette; he's the big man on campus, so we're told, and he's interested in Rain.  They do a duet together but beyond that, nothing happens between them.  His character has the charm of a piece of cardboard.  Like most of the characters, he was only in the movie because he was in the book.  His character was completely altered.  What little personality he possessed on the page, gone.  As for Rain, I think we could have been made to care about her more.I found the scene where Rain proves her knowledge of Hamlet to her snobby classmates to be incredibly obnoxious. But I think it was in the book too. It was a classic triumph of the underdog moment. And not very emotionally affecting. Her teacher says how the play is about more than a murder and looks to her to back the statement up. And she goes on to say how the story deals with ""life and love"". She could have at least said something a little more profound if they were going to make a big thing about how smart she is. Seriously.  Teacher:  ""What did you think about The Great Gatsby?""  Student:  Wonderful book about life and love. Teacher:  ""What did you think about Anna Karenina?""  Student:  Oh, it made me question what I'd always believed about life and love."" Come on.  The audience deserves a better answer than that.Now for the acting. Some of the actors did poorly, some were passable. Most of this is the fault of what they were given to work with.And now for those who read the book:Brody and Alison were completely taken out.  Victoria comes and goes, basically to show her disapproval of Rain and that's all. She was literally in the movie just to be in the movie. She was only in the movie for a total of about five or so minutes, divided up between two or three scenes. She could have easily been cut out of the movie and it wouldn't have affected the plot at all.  There's no real depth given to any of the characters. They just show up, play their little role and that's it.All traces of incest were taken out, which is not a bad thing at all. The incest didn't really serve any purpose in the book, after all.  It was only in the book because that's what people have come to expect of anything under the V.C. Andrews logo.Edit: As for the prequel that comes with the movie, I hear it's in booklet form, and only 48 pages long (though the type is allegedly small.)  I'm not sure if it still comes with the movie or not, since it is now a year or so later.  Maybe.  I don't know.Edit II:  I will say this.  I think Neiderman did the best he possibly could with his own material.  I imagine it's hard to fill the shoes of another writer, and just as hard to adapt your own book for the screen.  So I feel like I should give him a break.  That said, my sympathy does not make this a good movie.",1,Drizzle,1180742400,"06 2, 2007",2007,4602,"['many', 'V.C', 'Andrews', 'fans', 'know', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'book', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'opinion', 'was', 'written', 'Andrew', 'Neiderman', 'ghost', 'writer', 'V.C', 'Andrews', 'V.C.A', 'been', 'dead', 'now', '20', 'years', 'Neiderman', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'feel', 'butchered', 'own', 'story', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'wonderful', 'begin', 'Many', 'fans', 'will', 'know', 'even', 'book', 'was', 'retread', 'previous', 'series', 'wrote', 'V.C', 'Andrews', 'name', 'only', 'black', 'lead', 'character', 'say', 'so', 'everybody', 'history', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'book', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'it.This', 'movie', 'was', 'poor', 'quality', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'point', 'point', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'how', 'Rain', 'rises', 'top', 'rich', 'grandma', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'recently', 'supposed', 'be', 'emotionally', 'affecting', 'Rain', 'mixed', 'race', 'poor', 'background', 'grandmother', 'white', 'wealthy', 'found', 'message', 'simplistic', 'actually', 'have', 'been', 'movies', 'have', 'carried', 'off', 'such', 'message', 'well', 'one', ""n't"", 'just', ""n't"", 'try', 'hard', 'enough', 'get', 'invested', 'characters', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'cliche', 'still', 'have', 'twist', 'enough', 'heart', 'keep', 'hooked', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'manage', 'Here', 'basic', 'plot', 'Rain', 'finds', 'out', 'adopted', 'then', 'sister', 'murdered', 'gang', 'members', 'life', 'danger', 'live', 'real', 'grandmother', 'grandmother', 'down', 'first', 'then', 'warm', 'when', 'what', 'great', 'posture', 'how', 'nicely', 'also', 'polite', 'well-behaved', 'Rain', 'musically', 'inclined', 'so', 'Grandma', 'music', 'school', 'Meanwhile', 'gang', 'members', 'are', 'trying', 'hunt', 'Rain', 'down.Then', 'Corbette', 'big', 'man', 'campus', ""'re"", 'told', 'interested', 'Rain', 'do', 'duet', 'together', 'nothing', 'happens', 'character', 'charm', 'piece', 'cardboard', 'most', 'characters', 'was', 'only', 'movie', 'was', 'book', 'character', 'was', 'completely', 'altered', 'What', 'little', 'personality', 'possessed', 'page', 'gone', 'Rain', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'care', 'more.I', 'found', 'scene', 'where', 'Rain', 'knowledge', 'Hamlet', 'snobby', 'classmates', 'be', 'incredibly', 'obnoxious', 'think', 'was', 'book', 'too', 'was', 'classic', 'triumph', 'underdog', 'moment', 'not', 'very', 'emotionally', 'affecting', 'teacher', 'how', 'play', 'more', 'murder', 'back', 'statement', 'up', 'say', 'how', 'story', 'deals', 'life', 'love', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'said', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'profound', 'were', 'going', 'make', 'big', 'thing', 'how', 'smart', 'Seriously', 'Teacher', 'What', 'did', 'think', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'Student', 'Wonderful', 'book', 'life', 'love', 'Teacher', 'What', 'did', 'think', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'Student', 'Oh', 'made', 'question', 'what', ""'d"", 'always', 'believed', 'life', 'love', 'Come', 'audience', 'better', 'answer', 'that.Now', 'acting', 'actors', 'did', 'poorly', 'were', 'passable', 'Most', 'fault', 'what', 'were', 'given', 'work', 'with.And', 'now', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'Brody', 'Alison', 'were', 'completely', 'taken', 'out', 'Victoria', 'basically', 'show', 'disapproval', 'Rain', 'was', 'literally', 'movie', 'just', 'be', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'movie', 'total', 'five', 'so', 'minutes', 'divided', 'up', 'two', 'three', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'cut', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'affected', 'plot', 'real', 'depth', 'given', 'characters', 'just', 'show', 'up', 'play', 'little', 'role', 'it.All', 'traces', 'incest', 'were', 'taken', 'out', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'incest', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'serve', 'purpose', 'book', 'was', 'only', 'book', 'what', 'people', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'anything', 'V.C', 'Andrews', 'logo.Edit', 'prequel', 'movie', 'hear', 'booklet', 'form', 'only', '48', 'pages', 'long', 'type', 'allegedly', 'small', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'still', 'movie', 'not', 'now', 'year', 'so', 'later', 'Maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.Edit', 'II', 'will', 'say', 'think', 'Neiderman', 'did', 'best', 'possibly', 'could', 'own', 'material', 'imagine', 'hard', 'fill', 'shoes', 'writer', 'just', 'as', 'hard', 'adapt', 'own', 'book', 'screen', 'feel', 'should', 'give', 'break', 'said', 'sympathy', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'movie']",Rain codeblack

1057070,A33EDAMGVS18GY,B000NIVPA8,"D. FOXWORTH ""foxy""","[4, 6]","Rain.  Also the name of the 4 book series from V. C. Andrews.  This was a very enjoyable movie.  Brooklyn Sudano (Donna Summer's daughter) really captured the heart, soul, and essence of this amazing young woman.  All of V.C. Andrews women are amazing, be they young naive women who grow into astounding adults or the evil grandmothers who always, deep down, have a heart, even if they hide it well.Faye Dunaway was brilliant.  I can't imagine a better choice for this movie.  Robert Loggia was incredible.  I have to admit I really came to hate the villian who blackmailed and then tried to kill Rain.  A different twist from the book, but superbly worked into the movie.  You always have to hate someone in a V.C. Andrews novel / movie!Why this was not released in theatres is beyond me.  There's a lot of crap that gets released and then fades away to DVD.  This movie was not given the star quality it deserved.  Yes, the ""sequel"" inside the movie answered some questions but really left me wanting more, more!  Shame on Pocket Books for not publishing this as a full length VCA novel.  Megan was really fascinating!The screen play was by Andrew Neiderman who is also the VCA ghostwriter.  You've seen Mr. Neiderman's work before in The Devil's Advocate, an adaption of his own fine novel.

Rain is the daughter every mother hopes for:  talented, intelligent, sweet, kindhearted, considerate and has excellent manners.  She is also a very beautiful young lady.  This is a touching story with great music.  Donna Summers' daughter, Brooklyn Sudano, is excellent as Rain Arnold, the young girl who overhears a conversation which will change her life forever.  Tragedy leads to her having to leave her D.C. ghetto home for the wealthier world of the Hudsons.  It's not easy yet Rain has what it takes to fit in very well.  Faye Dunaway is exceptional as Mrs. Hudson.  She's a tough woman who does have a heart that can be touched and who better to get to her heart than Rain who is a very special young lady.  It's a pity they haven't made movies continuing this great, touching story.  This movie is so good that I bought two more copies to give to people close to me for presents.  They loved it as much as I do.  My mother and I watch this movie at least once a week and we never get tired of it.  The bad guy is really good.  He can be rather amusing at times.

So I'll just stick with a couple. In the book, her sister was the mean one and always ripping on her with the other girls. But in the movie, she was protrayed as the pathetic, weak one and her death wasn't even played out right. She was murdered inside the warehouse, not outside. The lead gang member was hardly believable as a hardened and evil criminal. His facial expressions actually cracked me up, they were so funny.Victoria should've played more of a role and Brody and Allison weren't even mentioned. The love Roy had for Rain wasn't even touched upon. I think Rain was an actor in the book, not a singer. And she wasn't even that good of a singer.

I think if you're going to make a movie from a book, then you should at least attempt to get some of the details from it right. Otherwise, what's the point??
