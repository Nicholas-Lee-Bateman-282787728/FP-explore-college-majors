1567830,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B008JFUTQ8,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Life is messy.  Sometimes things happen that force us to reevaluate our messy lives and in the end force us into reckless behavior.  This is explored with depth and a deft hand in `Hello I Must Be Going' a semi-tragic romantic comedy that introduces us to a recent divorcee with excess baggage to spare.`Hello I Must Be Going' tells us the story of Amy, a young woman who has been living with her parents ever since her husband left her.  She has been reduced to a sobbing mess and hasn't left the house in months, spending her days watching classic films and mopping around the house in oversized men's tee-shirts.  Her mother, the ever positive (but in that way that makes you feel so negative) Ruth, pleads with Amy to make some changes.  Spruce up, cheer up, put a dress on!  We have friends coming over for dinner and this is a big deal for your father SO DON'T RUIN IT!!!  What Amy gets from dinner is priceless though, and just what she needed, or was it?  Yes, Amy meets the 19-year old Jeremy; an actor who hates acting and pretends to be gay so him mother won't try and set him up with anyone.  Jeremy is attracted to Amy and Amy is consumed with this tingly feeling that comes from being desired and being naughty (since he's quite the younger man and the situation could potentially be devastating for their parents).  Soon the affair erupts and Amy's already fragile emotional balance is thrust on it's head.So much about this film works on so many levels that I'm saddened it didn't receive a bigger push when it was released.  I mean, how many people actually have heard of this movie?  Melanie Lynskey anchors this film with so much heart and soul.  She embodies Amy and lets her breath, running the gamut of emotions in a way that feels so natural.  What is so beautiful about Lynskey's performance is that she is able to find such depth in a character that could have been a clich&eacute;.  She adds so many beautiful touches (the happy moments in particular are so special to the development of her character).  She understands how to shade her portrayal with enough childish touches to create a fully realized woman.  She is jaded, she is pained, she is justified and yet she can't communicate these feelings correctly in a house filled to the brim with people so detached from the reality of life.The rest of the cast is certainly up to par, with Blythe Danner playing an aged variation of what I perceive her real life daughter Gwyneth Paltrow to be like, and I loved every minute of it!  She devoured her scenes and played up the `oppressive yet in a way that she doesn't feel is oppressive' angle marvelously.I'm in love with this film.  One of the best of the year, for sure, and a hidden gem for the many, many people who don't know yet that it exists.",5,I'll be staying for a while...,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,2778,"['Life', 'messy', 'Sometimes', 'things', 'happen', 'force', 'reevaluate', 'messy', 'lives', 'end', 'force', 'reckless', 'behavior', 'explored', 'depth', 'deft', 'hand', 'Hello', 'Must', 'Be', 'Going', 'semi-tragic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'recent', 'divorcee', 'excess', 'baggage', 'spare.', 'Hello', 'Must', 'Be', 'Going', 'tells', 'story', 'Amy', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'living', 'parents', 'ever', 'husband', 'left', 'been', 'reduced', 'sobbing', 'mess', ""n't"", 'left', 'house', 'months', 'spending', 'days', 'watching', 'classic', 'films', 'mopping', 'house', 'oversized', 'men', 'tee-shirts', 'mother', 'ever', 'positive', 'way', 'feel', 'so', 'negative', 'Ruth', 'Amy', 'make', 'changes', 'Spruce', 'up', 'cheer', 'up', 'put', 'dress', 'have', 'friends', 'coming', 'dinner', 'big', 'deal', 'father', 'SO', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'RUIN', 'IT', 'What', 'Amy', 'dinner', 'priceless', 'just', 'what', 'needed', 'was', 'Yes', 'Amy', '19-year', 'old', 'Jeremy', 'actor', 'who', 'acting', 'pretends', 'be', 'gay', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'try', 'set', 'up', 'anyone', 'Jeremy', 'attracted', 'Amy', 'Amy', 'consumed', 'tingly', 'feeling', 'being', 'desired', 'being', 'naughty', 'quite', 'younger', 'man', 'situation', 'could', 'potentially', 'be', 'devastating', 'parents', 'affair', 'erupts', 'Amy', 'already', 'fragile', 'emotional', 'balance', 'thrust', 'head.So', 'much', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'levels', ""'m"", 'saddened', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'bigger', 'push', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'mean', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'actually', 'have', 'heard', 'movie', 'Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'anchors', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'heart', 'soul', 'Amy', 'breath', 'running', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'way', 'so', 'natural', 'What', 'so', 'beautiful', 'Lynskey', 'performance', 'able', 'find', 'such', 'depth', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'clich', 'eacute', 'so', 'many', 'beautiful', 'touches', 'happy', 'moments', 'particular', 'are', 'so', 'special', 'development', 'character', 'how', 'shade', 'portrayal', 'enough', 'childish', 'touches', 'create', 'fully', 'realized', 'woman', 'jaded', 'pained', 'justified', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'communicate', 'feelings', 'correctly', 'house', 'filled', 'brim', 'people', 'so', 'detached', 'reality', 'life.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'certainly', 'up', 'par', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'playing', 'aged', 'variation', 'what', 'perceive', 'real', 'life', 'daughter', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'be', 'loved', 'minute', 'devoured', 'scenes', 'played', 'up', 'oppressive', 'yet', 'way', ""n't"", 'feel', 'oppressive', 'angle', 'marvelously.I', ""'m"", 'love', 'film', 'One', 'best', 'year', 'sure', 'hidden', 'gem', 'many', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet']",N/A

Amy hasn't legt the house in three months and doesn't get up before noon. In other words: depressed. Amy's dad, who is a lawyer, is trying to woo a potential new client, and at a dinner party with the potential new client and his extended family including his 19 yr. old stepson Jeremy (played by Christopher Abbott), Jeremy and Amy develop an instant crush on each other. Soon therafter, they have a fully blooming affair. Inevitably, one day, they get found out. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: (1) it must be Melanie Lynskey weekend for me here in Cincinnati: I just saw her yesterday in a (much smaller) role in ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and now today she stars front and center in this movie. It is easily one of her best roles ever, like she was made to play this role. If the movie gets any legs in the theatres, she might be a contender for an Leading Actress Oscar Nomination. (2) While the subject matter of the movie certainly is nothing new, it is brought to life by screenwriter Sarah Koskoff and director Todd Louiso (a Cincinnati native I might add, graduated from the Cincinnati School for Creative and Performing Arts). (3) Check out also the very nice original soundtrack, which is courtesy of Canadian singer-songwriter Laura Veirs.Last but not least, if you are wondering about the movie's title: Amy is watching a number of Marx Brothers films throughout the movie, reminding her of happier times in her youth when hanging out with dad. The tile comes from a song by Groucho Marx of the same title in ""Animal Crackers"". (And incidentally, it is also the source for the Phil Collins album of the same name in the early 80s.)

I liked this one. There was a good cross between typical rom-com scenes and truer to life indie scenes. Very understated and never hysterical, but I laughed a bit and smiled a lot. Although I had not particularly liked the main girl in other parts I've seen her in, I like her now! Overall it was much better than I had hoped it would be when I took the chance on watching it.",4,I really liked it,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,583,"[""'m"", 'always', 'hesitant', 'watch', 'Indie', 'Films', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'gon', 'get', 'true', 'gem', 'overly', 'self-important', 'crap', 'make', 'feel', 'stupid', 'trite', 'liking', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'liked', 'one', 'was', 'good', 'cross', 'typical', 'rom-com', 'scenes', 'truer', 'life', 'indie', 'scenes', 'Very', 'understated', 'never', 'hysterical', 'laughed', 'bit', 'smiled', 'lot', 'had', 'not', 'particularly', 'liked', 'main', 'girl', 'other', 'parts', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'now', 'Overall', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'when', 'took', 'chance', 'watching']",N/A
