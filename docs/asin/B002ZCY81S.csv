I think the network did a great injustice taking this show off the air.I was really excited to hear Ray Ramono, Scott Bakula, and Andre Braugher were in the same series. I am a big fan of Everybody Loves Raymond, Homiside, Enterprise and Quantum Leap.  I was very curious how all three of them would interact in this type of series. Wow, what a trio. It is comedy,drama,candidness, all wrapped up in one. You can relate to each character on an everyday basis. This is a realistic show, where it does not hide anything.  There are raw feelings throughout the show, which you can feel sad, about to laugh, or relate to what is going on. I am truly impressed.I really enjoyed watching Everybody Loves Raymond, but this performance by Ray really gives us a glimpse on how talented he is.  Andre also delivers another amazing performance! I was not sure about Scott's role since I am watching Quantum Leap which is the opposite of Scott's role in MOACA. However, Scott is able to bring it to the table and do also another amazing job. These guys have all done a performance of a lifetime!!I wish the network would reconsider!!!",5,WOW!!

1299801,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B002ZCY81S,barry,"[2, 2]","MEN OF A CERTAIN AGE is an intelligent, witty, warm and often insightful comedy/drama about three middle aged male friends.  I honestly can't recall another drama existing that seriously took the time to look realistically at the lives of men this age.  The three men - recently divorced Joe (Ray Romano), married car dealer Owen (Andre Braugher) and single faded actor Terry (Scott Bakula) are all very human and believable characters.  We get to enter their lives each week and share the trials and tribulations they encounter.  Sometimes funny, often heartbreaking and always relatable this excellently written and directed drama will appeal to everyone and not just men of this age for its issues are universal.  The true credit to the show goes to the superb acting done by all three leads.  Andre Braugher is getting deserved attention and has been nominated for an Emmy for each season of this show but for me the true revelation is Ray Romano.  Ray Romano of course achieved huge success on EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND and I think though believable and lovable in the part many thought it was the common stand up comedian having a series, the same as Jerry Seinfeld.  But here his sitcom character is quickly forgotten as he embodies the character of Joe.  He is slightly neurotic and insecure as he tries to deal with life as a divorced man.  And every action and step his character takes is even more belivable due to the depth of Romano's performance.Of course I don't mean to belittle either of the other leads and each viewer will probably have a favorite.  Great news in that there are no weak links here.  The supporting cast is also superb with the stand out for me being Lisa Gay Hamilton as Owen's wife Melissa.  Bottom line, this series is exceptional and brings a breath of fresh air to tv.

I really hope there is another season.  I can't recommend the series highly enough. Below is the original review:I am five episodes into this series and am absolutely knocked out.  The acting on this new series is absolutely superb and is equalled by the scripts.  I could never get into Ray Romano in his EVERYONE LOVES RAYMOND show despite its being an enormous hit.  Unlike that show, this is NOT a comedy although it has wryly comic moments. The premise is three guys in their late 40s who grew up together and have stayed together as friends their entire lives. Two of them are white and one is black. I grew up in a family business so the black character, spending his life in his father's car business, is the best story for me.  The actor does a superb job with the tensions inherent in working for your father, a former pro sports hero. He is also the only one who can hold down a marriage.  Ray Romano plays the one soon to be divorced primarily because of his gambling addiction. He owns a party store with lots of games, fittingly enough. This gambling addiction takes a fascinating script detour when he spends an entire evening in the company of his bookie as his friend for the night while his wife is out on a date. The third guy is the ladies man, a never made it actor who now tries out other occupations like some people try out new ties.  I like him the least of the three but that may be the point of including him. You are going to want to see this show, every episode.  I can hardly wait for episode six.",5,five episodes into this series and am absolutely knocked out,1262995200,"01 9, 2010",2010,1634,"['Update', 'just', 'watched', 'season', 'finale', 'episode', '10', 'series', 'remained', 'top', 'notch', 'first', 'last', 'really', 'hope', 'season', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'series', 'highly', 'enough', 'Below', 'original', 'review', 'am', 'five', 'episodes', 'series', 'am', 'absolutely', 'knocked', 'out', 'acting', 'new', 'series', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'equalled', 'scripts', 'could', 'never', 'get', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'EVERYONE', 'LOVES', 'RAYMOND', 'show', 'being', 'enormous', 'hit', 'show', 'NOT', 'comedy', 'wryly', 'comic', 'moments', 'premise', 'three', 'guys', 'late', '40s', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'together', 'have', 'stayed', 'together', 'friends', 'entire', 'lives', 'Two', 'are', 'white', 'one', 'black', 'grew', 'up', 'family', 'business', 'black', 'character', 'spending', 'life', 'father', 'car', 'business', 'best', 'story', 'actor', 'superb', 'job', 'tensions', 'inherent', 'working', 'father', 'former', 'pro', 'sports', 'hero', 'also', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'hold', 'down', 'marriage', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'one', 'soon', 'be', 'divorced', 'primarily', 'gambling', 'addiction', 'party', 'store', 'lots', 'games', 'fittingly', 'enough', 'gambling', 'addiction', 'fascinating', 'script', 'detour', 'when', 'entire', 'evening', 'company', 'bookie', 'friend', 'night', 'wife', 'out', 'date', 'third', 'guy', 'ladies', 'man', 'never', 'made', 'actor', 'who', 'now', 'out', 'other', 'occupations', 'people', 'try', 'out', 'new', 'ties', 'like', 'least', 'three', 'may', 'be', 'point', 'including', 'are', 'going', 'want', 'see', 'show', 'episode', 'can', 'hardly', 'wait', 'episode', 'six']",Men of a Certain Age: Season 1

These three guys are terrific together! One is married, one divorced, and one who's never been married yet - with this in mind, they are covering ALL the issues that life at mid-life can throw anyone. They're great friends though their personalities are different. Ray Romano, for example, IS his character no matter what show he is in. He just must be that layback, easy-going, goofy kind of character in real life!  The other two actors were new to me when I began watching the show, but I soon grew very close to them. I enjoy seeing how men deal with the same issues that women encounter at that particular time of life...it's so common to see shows, movies, read books & articles, and be deluged with how women handle their problems. Men have somehow been tucked away in the unknown regions when it comes to things like that. I'm so glad this show has come out and taken upon itself to show how men handle life - the good, the bad, the highs and the lows - and include (as this show does) some terrific comedy and great lines between these guys.For anyone who hasn't seen this show yet - I encourage you wholeheartedly - WATCH IT!

A Bowen ""tabithajab""","[5, 5]","Joe Tranelli (Ray Romano), Terry Elliott (Scott Bakula), and Owen Thoreau, Jr. (Andre Braugher) have been friends forever -- or at least since college.  Now in their late forties, pushing fifty, all three find themselves in places they never thought they would be.  Sweet, funny Joe, a family man at heart, finds himself unexpectedly divorced after a gambling addiction rears its ugly head.  Terry, a struggling actor with some real talent, is still single, unable resist the lure of the audition as well as the siren call.  Owen, with a sweet wife (Lisa Gay Hamilton), three adorable kids, and an impossibly successful, arrogant ex-athlete father, wakes up each morning in a C-pap mask.  He is an overweight diabetic, trying to live up to Daddy's achievements, and haunted at every turn by the thought that he might just be an imposter.These three friends meet several times a week for a hike (good for the blood sugar and weight) and breakfast (a la ""Sex and the City"", but thankfully we leave sex in the bedroom where it belongs, most of the time).  There, with the help of a witty and believable screenplay, they hash out their weeks' problems.  They make fun of each other (male humor), encourage each other (because at heart they are really nice guys), and sometimes solve each other's problems.It is wonderful to see the great Andre Braugher in a venue finally befitting his talents.  He was the rivetting star on ""Homicide: Life on the Streets"" -- the one you just couldn't take your eyes off of.  He does not disappoint in this series, where his humor, honesty, and integrity as an actor can shine.  Bakula, always intriguing, does an admirable job as Terry.  He brings a humanity and self-mockery to this role of the man-child, and you can't help rooting for him.  But it is Romano who owns the show, in my opinion.  Self-deprecating, struggling, humorous as always, a man who may have lost most of what mattered to him but is holding on for dear life -- this is the character you have to love.  He does a great job as Joe, and a great job as the creator of the show.

Somehow I missed the first year and only picked it up 1 episode into the 2nd season, but getting the first year on DVD made it all fall into place. You could almost call this a ""sex in the city for men"" as it's about 3 long time buddies entering the middle age ""crisis zone"" and dealing with the sort of stuff that happens;  divorce, gambling addictions, familial disputes between fathers and sons, but with a moral code of what can happen when you tempt fate a bit too often.  It's about bad habits and how they manage to catch up with you and about how sometimes you can do everything right and still have a less than satisfactory outcome. It's also about how these 3  re-evaluate their lives, make the course corrections, and..... I guess we won't know until the series' finale.We  don't easily recognize that there's two parts to life.

He was into it immediately and said to me you have finally purchased something that I can relate to.  I was surprised but happy because I have been trying to purchase something that he would enjoy as much as I do.

The overall chemistry between these three characters (all played by very good or better actors) makes the show work.

1299820,A1RW4DRDC4U9PU,B002ZCY81S,Timothy Price,"[2, 3]","Men of a Certain Age is the brand new TNT show from Ray Romano.  It stars Ray alongside two of televisions finest actors Scott Bakula and Andre Braugher.  The show focuses on three friends each dealing with being in their mid 40s.  It's ostensibly a drama with some lighter comedic moments thrown in.  The tone is perfect and it's very easy to feel for these characters.Ray Romano plays Joe a recently divorced man who runs a party shop and has a gambling problem. Scott Bakula is a struggling actor finding it hard to land any new roles. Andre Braugher is working as a car salesman at his father's dealership. All three characters have compelling story lines which drive the show forward.Two of my favorite actors of all time are Scott Bakula and Andre Braugher.  Scott Bakula was brilliant as Dr Sam Beckett leaping in and out of people each week on Quantum Leap.  Andre Braugher was a powerhouse performing as Detective Frank Pembleton on Homicide: Life on the Street. Homicide remains my favorite TV show of all time. I think both actors have struggled to find good projects since then, but they've both finally landed on a good show.The chemistry between all the actors is fantastic.  Their lifelong friendship is very believable. The scenes between them all at the diner, hiking or at home all work well.  The person who I was truly surprised with is Ray Romano. I never considered him a great actor, he clearly is a great comedian and is now proving himself as a great writer.  His character Joe really resonates. It's a very honest performance.Andre Braugher is an incredible actor.  He could read a phone book and I'd be glued to the screen. This is a very different role though. It was originally written for Bunk from The Wire but when David Simon required him for his new HBO show ""Treme"" Andre came in at the last minute.  I'm glad he did, he does play more comedy here than he is known for. I think Andre can do comedy just fine, there is plenty of funny scenes between Pembleton and Bayliss on Homicide as examples of that.  This is no raging Pembleton in the box though.  It's no good vs evil showdown with the intensity of an interrogation.  Even so, It's no less enjoyable.  Here Andre's character is really struggling, trying to support his wife and kids and do a job that he simply doesn't want to do.  He's a broken character so it will be interesting to see his journey over the course of the season.Scott Bakula is another actor who can have some amazing dramatic moments.  He play's the comedy to perfection in his role.  I think the way these characters interact with the younger characters is telling.  They've already been through it all before so they look on in bemusement.  Still, Scott's character still clings to his youth and even begins dating a 25 year old.  I love the scene where he goes to an audition for a lifetime series and stands in the hall. He is surrounded by plenty of other good looking 40 year olds who are great actors. There is a sense of resignation to his situation.This show got overlooked when it first aired but it's clearly that a new show that you should discover on DVD.  It's something different. There's not any show on TV dealing with middle age men. It's not simply about a mid-life crisis.  These are very well drawn characters,very realistic, and extremely watchable.  Give this show a chance I think if it can find an audience on DVD it has plenty of seasons left in it.",5,Men of a Certain Age shines the light back on two great actors,1288656000,"11 2, 2010",2010,3436,"['Men', 'Certain', 'Age', 'brand', 'new', 'TNT', 'show', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'Ray', 'alongside', 'two', 'televisions', 'finest', 'actors', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'show', 'three', 'friends', 'dealing', 'being', 'mid', '40s', 'ostensibly', 'drama', 'lighter', 'comedic', 'moments', 'thrown', 'tone', 'perfect', 'very', 'easy', 'feel', 'characters.Ray', 'Romano', 'Joe', 'recently', 'divorced', 'man', 'who', 'party', 'shop', 'gambling', 'problem', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'struggling', 'actor', 'finding', 'hard', 'land', 'new', 'roles', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'working', 'car', 'salesman', 'father', 'dealership', 'three', 'characters', 'have', 'compelling', 'story', 'lines', 'drive', 'show', 'forward.Two', 'favorite', 'actors', 'time', 'are', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Dr', 'Sam', 'Beckett', 'leaping', 'people', 'week', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'was', 'powerhouse', 'performing', 'Detective', 'Frank', 'Pembleton', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Street', 'Homicide', 'favorite', 'TV', 'show', 'time', 'think', 'actors', 'have', 'struggled', 'find', 'good', 'projects', 'then', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'landed', 'good', 'show.The', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'fantastic', 'lifelong', 'friendship', 'very', 'believable', 'scenes', 'diner', 'hiking', 'home', 'work', 'well', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'truly', 'surprised', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'never', 'considered', 'great', 'actor', 'clearly', 'great', 'comedian', 'now', 'proving', 'great', 'writer', 'character', 'Joe', 'really', 'very', 'honest', 'performance.Andre', 'Braugher', 'incredible', 'actor', 'could', 'read', 'phone', 'book', ""'d"", 'be', 'glued', 'screen', 'very', 'different', 'role', 'was', 'originally', 'written', 'Bunk', 'Wire', 'when', 'David', 'Simon', 'required', 'new', 'HBO', 'show', 'Treme', 'Andre', 'came', 'last', 'minute', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'play', 'more', 'comedy', 'here', 'known', 'think', 'Andre', 'can', 'do', 'comedy', 'just', 'fine', 'plenty', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Pembleton', 'Bayliss', 'Homicide', 'examples', 'raging', 'Pembleton', 'box', 'good', 'vs', 'evil', 'showdown', 'intensity', 'interrogation', 'Even', 'so', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'Here', 'Andre', 'character', 'really', 'struggling', 'trying', 'support', 'wife', 'kids', 'do', 'job', 'simply', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'broken', 'character', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'journey', 'course', 'season.Scott', 'Bakula', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'have', 'amazing', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'play', 'comedy', 'perfection', 'role', 'think', 'way', 'characters', 'interact', 'younger', 'characters', 'telling', ""'ve"", 'already', 'been', 'look', 'bemusement', 'Still', 'Scott', 'character', 'still', 'youth', 'even', 'dating', '25', 'year', 'old', 'love', 'scene', 'where', 'audition', 'lifetime', 'series', 'hall', 'surrounded', 'plenty', 'other', 'good', 'looking', '40', 'year', 'olds', 'who', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'sense', 'resignation', 'situation.This', 'show', 'got', 'overlooked', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'clearly', 'new', 'show', 'should', 'discover', 'DVD', 'something', 'different', 'not', 'show', 'TV', 'dealing', 'middle', 'age', 'men', 'not', 'simply', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'drawn', 'characters', 'very', 'realistic', 'extremely', 'watchable', 'Give', 'show', 'chance', 'think', 'can', 'find', 'audience', 'DVD', 'plenty', 'seasons', 'left']",Men of a Certain Age: Season 1
