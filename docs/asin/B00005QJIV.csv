675436,A1JLIG5EIQZMD0,B00005QJIV,aquestari,"[3, 5]","Welcome to a day in the life of Shawn: a young, depressed, cynical and openly suicidal woman whose life seems all but going down the toilet at lightning speed. The basic grasp of the movie is, we're taken through a timeline of events that happen on the day Shawn decides to die. There are a lot of good flashbacks showing exactly what's going on in her mind, intriguing use of slow motion and speed, and of course, sharp, witty humour. However, with all the dramatic footage to keep your eyes glued to the tv, unfortunately the director takes a horrible turn and the movie just becomes another lame stunt of trying to tell people that their Romeo will come along when you least expect it and they will save you. The movie is both a thriller and soppy romance. It's sad a movie that could have been so deep and meaningful had to turn out this way. But what movie doesn't? Worth watching, but keep your expectations low.",3,"Starts off promising, ends tragically",1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,918,"['Welcome', 'day', 'life', 'Shawn', 'young', 'depressed', 'cynical', 'openly', 'suicidal', 'woman', 'life', 'going', 'down', 'toilet', 'lightning', 'speed', 'basic', 'grasp', 'movie', ""'re"", 'taken', 'timeline', 'events', 'happen', 'day', 'Shawn', 'die', 'are', 'lot', 'good', 'flashbacks', 'showing', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'mind', 'intriguing', 'use', 'slow', 'motion', 'speed', 'course', 'sharp', 'witty', 'humour', 'However', 'dramatic', 'footage', 'keep', 'eyes', 'glued', 'tv', 'unfortunately', 'director', 'horrible', 'turn', 'movie', 'just', 'lame', 'stunt', 'trying', 'tell', 'people', 'Romeo', 'will', 'come', 'along', 'when', 'least', 'expect', 'will', 'save', 'movie', 'thriller', 'soppy', 'romance', 'sad', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'had', 'turn', 'out', 'way', 'what', 'movie', ""n't"", 'Worth', 'watching', 'keep', 'expectations', 'low']",N/A

Selma Blair is a fabulous, currently underrated actress and Max Beesley was rather charming in ""Kill Me Later"". The story, while not exactly original, certainly showed some promise. None of that mattered though...at all.I don't know what her deal is, but director Dana Lustig has virtually no talent whatsoever as a director. She slowed footage down, sped footage up, reversed footage, used awkward camera angles, used annoying color filters, made a zillion quick cuts, jumped back and forth in the timeline and topped it all off with an obnoxious ""modern"" soundtrack of blaring junk. I can't remember the last time I saw such an incompetent job of directing a film. Her ego must be huge to toss out the acting and story and put her direction front and center for the audience members to take notice of. It is crammed down their throats.There are a couple of good scenes in ""Kill Me Later"" which show what could have and should have been. Unfortunately, just when things would start to show promise, Ms. Lustig would dig into her bag of film school tricks and jumble things up again.

A fleeing armed robber, cornered by a cop on the rooftop of the bank he's just knocked over, unintentionally saves the life of one of the bank's employees-a suicidal young woman who is seconds away from taking her fatal plunge. The desperate criminal soon realizes that Fate has chosen the worst possible person to serve as his ""human shield""...someone who WANTS to die! After this setup, I thought I had this one pegged as a slight variation on ""Ruthless People"" or ""The Ref""--but it actually turned out to be a closer cousin to ""Buffalo 66"" or ""Harold & Maude"", films that seem ""dark"" but upon closer inspection are actually quite life-affirming love stories. The two very appealing lead performances hold your interest throughout, particularly from newcomer (to me at least) Selma Blair, who has a sort of Linda Fiorentino sexiness morphed with Sandra Bernhard's caustic attitude. The cinematographer makes good use of the Vancouver B.C. environs (although as someone who lives in the Northwest, I had to chuckle at one rugged evergreen Alpine setting that is supposed to represent the ""high mountains of Mexico"").

675440,AIO247KHD2O40,B00005QJIV,James N Simpson,"[0, 0]","Selma Blair plays the lead role in this great film, you'll know her from the film with Reece Witherspoon and Sarah Michelle Gellar made two years before this called Cruel Intentions.  Sure she hasn't been in anything as successful as that movie since, but this film made in 2001 should have been just as successful as it is very, very good. Plus she looks ten times better in this, than in that one. Had never even heard of this movie before I found it in a national $2 store chain.  I occasionally pick up these that have interesting covers or with big name stars made before they found fame, as they are cheaper than renting a movie.  Usually they are forgettable and you can see why they never made it, but sometimes, as with this great movie, they have just slipped through the cracks somehow.Blair plays a bank employee who is the mistress of the bank manger. He tells her he loves her and is getting a divorce soon. She's rather depressed with her life and has tried slitting her wrists in the days before her lover's wife walks into the bank.  The wife is heavily pregnant and obviously in love with her husband, clearly he has no intention of leaving.  After telling off some idiot customers in a way most customer service staff would fantasize about she heads for the roof to end it all.  While standing on the edge unbeknownst to her, the bank is being robbed, when she finally gets the courage and steps off the roof she is pulled back with an arm around her throat and a gun to her head.  The robber tells her he'll kill her, she's fine with that but the police aren't so back off.  The robber wants her to come with him as a hostage, she just wants to kill herself, they reach a compromise, that she'll help him escape, if he shoots her dead when they are in the clear.  Of course Charlie (the robber) has no intention of committing murder as the police put a lot more resources into solving and never give up on catching a murderer.  Plus he's got some morals and can't just watch her lie down on tram tracks either so he's got to take her along for the ride hoping she'll come to her senses when he can part ways from her with a clear conscience.This is a good movie, with some great lines, with a fair amount of humour and action as well.  It should have been more successful than it was.  Maybe if it had had a bigger star as the other main character than Max Beesley (never heard of him before either) it would have been more successful.

675445,A2T8L3RQCW3ESR,B00005QJIV,"Mike Patrick, professor of media","[1, 2]","This one's a cute, little indie thriller with a silly name and even sillier premise, which succeeds with some endearing performances and creative direction.Selma Blair plays a suicidal snot rescued by accident from her 13-story building leap by an armored car bandit. The deal: She helps him escape, he agrees to kill her later. Hence, the title, the setup and the plot roll all together into one gloppy Cinnabon of a movie.Blair should permanently hire the makeup artist who made her appear, perhaps for the first time, somewhat attractive, despite being required to chain smoke (and, oddly be admonished for it by nearly every male character) throughout the movie.Max Beesley as the hapless bank robber was good in this movie, I think, except I couldn't understand a word he said. He talked faster and more Cockney than Davy Jones on coke.What city is this? Sometimes it looks like New York, sometimes maybe Seattle. Is it raining? Sometimes yes, sometimes, no. Sometimes it cuts to a guy drumming outside on his porch for NO FREAKING REASON.Friends, don't pay attention to that. It's not like this thriller was directed by Ridley Scott, know what I'm saying? Ain't no tautness here. It's a meandering, little independent film with no aspirations to be anything greater, with all the artsy-fartsy trappings and pitfalls you'd expect in a meandering, little independent film. Sometimes the conceits work, but the best you can hope for is that they don't distract too badly (and they don't).That said, the movie would have benefited greatly by a more distinct location. Setting can sometimes become a character in itself, and a film devoid of interesting characters (though interestingly played, which is not the same thing) really needs some attention to detail regarding place. Had the film been set in New York's East Village or some specific Seattle neighborhood, it would have been much more effective. Making the setting vague may have been a creative decision (This could happen anywhere! To YOU!). But my guess is it was budgetary, because the film as a whole comes off like that.Yet, money isn't the make-or-break here. It's really no excuse. Look at the independent horror films of Frank Henenlotter or even the mid-career work of Jonathan Demme, and you'll find a lack of money doesn't necessarily have to translate into indistinct setting. A director's affinity for place can be successfully expressed cinematically on any budget. Just ask Woody Allen.It's the writing. Elmore Leonard would have done wonders with this story. But writer/producer/director Dana Lustig, who's done nothing else you've ever heard of (and probably never will), uses jump cuts and other camera tricks to try to mask shallow dialog, superficial characters with no development, and a deliberately paced plot. Mostly, she fails. (At one point toward the end, the entire movie becomes a two-color blue-black cartoon for about 45 seconds, FOR NO FREAKING REASON.)But Lustig does have a knack for enticing good performances from her actors, even the minor ones (like the elderly bank robbery accomplice who would have been played by Ray Walston, were he still alive). Unfortunately, the movie just kind of forgets about him after awhile. Really, I hope he's OK.Anyway, Blair and Beesley succeed in making their characters endearing to the viewer, even though their lives are wholly distasteful. (Hey, when the viewer is rooting for the violent bank robber and the dour, suicidal homewrecker get together and tongue-kiss at the end, you gotta thank the actors for pulling that off). Lustig's in debt to these actors because their performances make the audience care and, thus, hold this movie together.And so, this movie is enjoyable, just not as much as it could have been.But coulda-woulda-shouldas don't fly with a piece of art.

675446,A30DWPM6HYVFYK,B00005QJIV,"""rebecccccccccca""","[2, 4]","Kill Me Later is a shining example of what a dark comedy is all about.  In the fabulous tradition of Heathers, you are thrown into the middle of Sean's (a sick and tired, apathetic banker played charmingly well by Selma Blair) world -- a boring desk job, an affair with a married man, a barely-there relationship with her disconnected and remarried father.. you get the point.  As her day starts off annoyingly bad, she heads to work.  Things at work aren't going too well.  She breaks off the affair.  She's finally had enough, and heads to the rooftop of the bank.As she's drinking booze and balancing herself on the edge of the building, the bank is being robbed.  Things don't necessarily go as planned, and one of the robbers is chased to the roof by a policeman.  There, he sees Sean and stops her, mid-jump, to take her as his hostage.  Having a hostage who's life doesn't matter to them isn't that great of a bargaining chip, as he soons learns when he tells her to be quiet or he'll kill her, and she points out to him that she was right in the middle of doing that herself.  At his wit's end, he convinces her that if she cooperates as a hostage, he'll later kill her anyways, as she wishes.  Now an accomplice to the robbery, she goes along with the plan.This movie is original, hilarious, and quite enjoyable.  Never a dull part, if you favor this genre, you're sure to enjoy this barely publicized gem.  A wonderful role taken on exceptionally well by Selma Blair, it definitely shouldn't go unnoticed.",5,Dark comedy fan?
