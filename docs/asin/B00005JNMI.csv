It had great characters and was likeable and funny.I can't say the same thing for the dreck they're putting out now.  I guess the producers think that if it has attitude, is disrespectul and profane, it's what people want to watch.NOT!More and more, I think people are simply turning off the crap, and surfing the vast TV offerings to try to find something interesting and decent to watch.

Like ""comfort"" the plot revolves mostly around a father and his two daughters. In this case though the daughters (played by Dinah Manoff and Kristy McNichol) have come back home after striking out in life. We get to see a bit more depth at times regarding the lives of the characters and things sometimes get fairly dramatic for a comedy. The series began to falter after a few seasons but the first couple were great!This is a very good comedy and deserves to be released on DVD.",4,"Kind of like ""too close for comfort"" only with a bit more character depth!",1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,584,"['were', 'fan', 'TV', 'series', 'too', 'close', 'comfort', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'comfort', 'plot', 'mostly', 'father', 'two', 'daughters', 'case', 'daughters', 'played', 'Dinah', 'Manoff', 'Kristy', 'McNichol', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'home', 'striking', 'out', 'life', 'get', 'see', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'times', 'regarding', 'lives', 'characters', 'things', 'sometimes', 'get', 'fairly', 'dramatic', 'comedy', 'series', 'began', 'falter', 'few', 'seasons', 'first', 'couple', 'were', 'great', 'very', 'good', 'comedy', 'deserves', 'be', 'released', 'DVD']",N/A

I've watched Kristy McNichol grow up from a young child into a beautiful woman, and she was GREAT on this show, as well as the others.  I'm extremely disappointed that I cannot find all 7 seasons of this family show on DVD, as I've been checking *everywhere* for so long, to no avail. If they would just put it out on DVD, I'm SURE they would make TONS of sales!  Don't know why it's taking forever... My heart sank when Kristy dropped out of the spotlight, and I'm hoping she will have a change of heart and come back to movies & TV sometime in the near future; and I'm speaking for not only myself, but for all her other #1 fans as well.  She would get SO MUCH support from all of us!  Great actress of all time!  :)  This and &#34;Family&#34;, that Kristy was in, were fabulous shows! I own the 1st and 2nd seasons of &#34;Family&#34; but that's all they offer on DVD.  :(  C'mon folks.... bring them back!!!!  :)",5,"C'mon, Peeps, Bring ""Empty Nest"" and ""Family"" on DVD SOON!
