A standard half hour TV show DVD release puts 8 episodes per disc.  That means these episodes have had added compression applied to them.  This reduces the video quality available.  The average size of an episode on these discs is 650 MB.  A standard such release would be around 800 to 900.  The quality could have been increased by adding 2 more discs.Unfortunately, the third season is when the series started veering more towards comedy and away from the semi-serious tone of season 2.  The comedy focus doesn't really work, though.  While the show would be better known for its comedic elements, it didn't start off entirely that way.

Mackay ""Felix""","[1, 2]","All in all, I'd say I've become accustomed to high quality box-set releases, so when I realised they're taking their time to release this series one disc at a time, I was a little disapointed... I just feel that the turtles deserved a little better. Also after playing the discs of this series, I was expecting them to clean up the prints a little, but it doesn't seem to have been done. And the opening sequence looks like it's from an old worn-out tape, not the original masters. I'm also disapointed there are no commercial break sequences saying the turtles will be right back.. (RHINO had added those to the G.I. Joe DVDs that they never got to finish, but that's another story..).I don't care much about bonuses, so considering the low price of the DVDs, I'll say it's ok (there are none). Just above passing grade. It's also not too hard on my paycheck to pay for the series 10$ at a time... It seems they are at least releasing the episodes in order. I just wish they had done a release similar to the HE-MAN box sets.... Now THAT is quality stuff for an affordable price..I hope when they release The Real Ghostbusters on DVD, they will follow ""Entertainment Rights""'s example and release the series in quality chronological box sets...",3,Kawabunga !,1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,1245,"[""'d"", 'say', ""'ve"", 'become', 'accustomed', 'high', 'quality', 'box-set', 'releases', 'when', 'realised', ""'re"", 'taking', 'time', 'release', 'series', 'one', 'disc', 'time', 'was', 'little', 'disapointed', 'just', 'feel', 'turtles', 'deserved', 'little', 'better', 'Also', 'playing', 'discs', 'series', 'was', 'expecting', 'clean', 'up', 'prints', 'little', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'opening', 'sequence', 'old', 'worn-out', 'tape', 'not', 'original', 'masters', ""'m"", 'also', 'disapointed', 'are', 'commercial', 'break', 'sequences', 'saying', 'turtles', 'will', 'be', 'right', 'back..', 'RHINO', 'had', 'added', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'DVDs', 'never', 'got', 'finish', 'story..', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'bonuses', 'so', 'considering', 'low', 'price', 'DVDs', ""'ll"", 'say', 'ok', 'are', 'none', 'Just', 'passing', 'grade', 'also', 'not', 'too', 'hard', 'paycheck', 'pay', 'series', '10', 'time', 'are', 'least', 'releasing', 'episodes', 'order', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'done', 'release', 'similar', 'HE-MAN', 'box', 'sets', 'Now', 'quality', 'stuff', 'affordable', 'price..I', 'hope', 'when', 'release', 'Real', 'Ghostbusters', 'DVD', 'will', 'follow', 'Entertainment', 'Rights', 'example', 'release', 'series', 'quality', 'chronological', 'box', 'sets']",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Original Series (Volume 3)

I know, we're all a little disappointed that the whole seasons arent being released. I guess there are no plans since they keep putting out the ""best of"" volumes. STILL...it's awesome to have such an amazing series being released, however the format. I'll take as many best ofs they can throw at me! We can't control these companies, so we can make the best of it. 12 is a nice number, and these 12 from season 3 are some of the best of the whole series. Standouts include ""The Old Switcheroo"", when Shredder and Splinter swap places, ""Enter the Rat King"", where Splinter is put under this new villain's control, and ""April Fool"", where April is mistaken for a princess and kidnapped by Shredder who plans to use her for ransom to get a rare diamond. Part of the show's enormous success was due to the extremely likable characters. The turtles, of course all have distinct personalities. Their master,Splinter may not share in their love of pizza but he can whoop up on the foot clan and whip his students into shape, both physically and mentally. Their best friend April O' Neil is one of the best loved tough heroines since She Ra. Even her fellow reporters at Channel 6 are just as important to the series, usually adding comic relief. Check the Rat King episode where lonely desperate for a man Irma insists the Rat King capture her instead of April! Even a maniac will reject Irma, and you can't help but love her. Where is the Irma action figure by the way? As for the villians, the standards are Shredder, Krang, Bebop and Rocksteady, along with an army of foot and rock soldiers. The writing is razor sharp and very clever and the bad guys's constant bickering will keep you in stiches, especially the exchanges between Shredder and the brain-inside an android Krang. In one episode, Krang mentions he doesn't leave the technodrome without his ""alien express card""..LOL! Another cool thing I've always loved is the music! Aside from the theme song, there are nice bits of music that builds up the tension or excitement. The show had a knack for an eerie synth-dramatic sound. It's brilliant. Parents, if you're concerned about the violence, I wouldn't be. Like He Man and the Masters of the Universe, there are messages and lessons to be learned, although not made as blantantly as He Man did at the end of every episode. Aside from the 80's -surfer dude speech of Michaelangelo, the series is not dated at all and is fresh as a brand new pizza. Sink your teeth into these!

Although this set is treated just like the previous release which was that of all the episodes of Season 2, but Season 3 is one of the longest in the series at around 40 or more episodes that make up this season.  While I'd expect that if that sales of the first two was good enough to bring out starting of Season 3 that they'd would have started a season earlier with the sets or at least with this set have it divided in two sets.  For example like Season 3 Volume 1 containing half of the episodes on a set number of discs, although they continued to go with this route trying to cram 12 episodes on one disc.I wonder if the people that were in charge of the DVD releases knew anything about their marketing cause so far with 3 Volumes without putting that much effort into making these Volumes worth the overall purchase for the fans.  While it's nice that the first 12 episodes of Season 3 made it onto DVD, while at the same time it may have been nice to have thought of something during the Season 2 release of this series.
