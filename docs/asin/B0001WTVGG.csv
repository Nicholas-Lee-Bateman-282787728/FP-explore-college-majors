It was a big deal at the time to have a made for TV family movie (do they even do that kind of thing anymore?) that featured the young actors of that period starring alongside the young actors of yesteryear (or now, the year before yesteryear).  Jo, Kimberly Drummond, Willis Jackson, and Alex P. Keaton were the students and Gilligan, Dobie Gillis, Eddie Haskell, and Wally Cleaver were among the teachers/faculty/parents.  It was creatively written, though many of the gags were lame and corny even for back then.I won't say it's not corny.  I won't say it's not embarrassingly lame in some parts.  I won't say it's not too silly for it's own good.  But I also won't say it's not fun.  Indeed, for all it's lameness and corniness, this is still a fun movie to watch.",3,Bring the girl,1284076800,"09 10, 2010",2010,830,"['remember', 'when', 'HIGH', 'SCHOOL', 'U.S.A.', 'first', 'aired', 'back', '1983', 'was', 'big', 'deal', 'time', 'have', 'made', 'TV', 'family', 'movie', 'do', 'even', 'do', 'kind', 'thing', 'anymore', 'featured', 'young', 'actors', 'period', 'starring', 'young', 'actors', 'yesteryear', 'now', 'year', 'yesteryear', 'Jo', 'Kimberly', 'Drummond', 'Willis', 'Jackson', 'Alex', 'P.', 'Keaton', 'were', 'students', 'Gilligan', 'Dobie', 'Gillis', 'Eddie', 'Haskell', 'Wally', 'Cleaver', 'were', 'teachers/faculty/parents', 'was', 'creatively', 'written', 'many', 'gags', 'were', 'lame', 'corny', 'even', 'back', 'then.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'not', 'corny', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'not', 'embarrassingly', 'lame', 'parts', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'not', 'too', 'silly', 'own', 'good', 'also', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'not', 'fun', 'Indeed', 'lameness', 'corniness', 'still', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch']",N/A
