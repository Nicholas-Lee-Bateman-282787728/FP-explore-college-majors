It starts right in action and you get whole hour of boredom until the moment where cards are revealed and you know what is actually going on in the movie. The special effects are not the worst and far to the best. However you can see, that the director actually tried to make the special outfit for the special forces and the graphics as told before are not bad. The monsters are boring looking however they look like monsters and it seems like he put some money in it. One of the actors had a very funny voice, hew was my favorite actor from the movie. Funny thing that when you think this movie has another hero, it actually does not and therefore a movie has some twists. I was thinking it is about aliens but no, closer to the end where truth gets revealed you realize it is far nothing to do with aliens or mutants. Well I watched the movie, and it got me bored to be honest, however you still can give it a chance.",2,Director put some efforts in it,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,939,"['movie', 'okay', 'right', 'action', 'get', 'whole', 'hour', 'boredom', 'moment', 'where', 'cards', 'are', 'revealed', 'know', 'what', 'actually', 'going', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'worst', 'far', 'best', 'However', 'can', 'see', 'director', 'actually', 'tried', 'make', 'special', 'outfit', 'special', 'forces', 'graphics', 'told', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'monsters', 'are', 'boring', 'looking', 'however', 'look', 'monsters', 'put', 'money', 'One', 'actors', 'had', 'very', 'funny', 'voice', 'hew', 'was', 'favorite', 'actor', 'movie', 'Funny', 'thing', 'when', 'think', 'movie', 'hero', 'actually', 'not', 'therefore', 'movie', 'twists', 'was', 'thinking', 'aliens', 'closer', 'end', 'where', 'truth', 'revealed', 'realize', 'far', 'nothing', 'do', 'aliens', 'mutants', 'Well', 'watched', 'movie', 'got', 'bored', 'be', 'honest', 'however', 'still', 'can', 'give', 'chance']",The Dark Lurking
1367138,A2EYK6YZDMBF3M,B003VE9WXS,"Gael Shellenberger ""tvsgael22""","[3, 3]","The cover art suggests Aliens, but it's more of a DOOM scenario, with creatures that would fit in that movie instead of ALEINS, and DOOM clones haven't been done to death either.  I don't know why people gripe about seeing yet another ""take"" on a familiar theme like ravenous creatures on board a ship.  If one counts the number of vampire and werewolf movies that come out every year, then we really do have something to talk about.  I looked forward to seeing this film and was not disappointed.  It took little time to get right to that action, and those slimey humanoid creatures are really great too look at. And for once, you didn't have to wait for half the movie to see them.  They are in your face right off the bat, and the camera gives you lots of great looks at them rather than shots so brief that you have to pause your player.This movie is a hard one to seek out, as I wasn't even aware of it until I saw the title in an ""also available"" section on the dvd special sections of DEMME KING, THE SEA MONSTER.

Ok the film fist off I heard these strange accents yank Aussie New Zealand british and I felt the $20 odd dollars leaving my wallet this film was so Dark hence the title I guess only lights were the muzzle flashes a lot like that shocka with Johnny Depp about gangsters monsters dis not in any way look like the cover art but I give it a huge tick for non stop action I looked it up on line (after I had bought it) to find the Director only had a million to play with If he can do this with so little what will he do with enough money to get better actors I cant wait.
