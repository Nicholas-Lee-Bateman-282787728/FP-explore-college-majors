I was looking for more of an Indian dance routine/workout like I saw on Fittv with Instructor Sarina Jina.  This DVD combines several Indian dance moves with crisscross jumping jacks, half jacks, squats...  However, the workouts were difficult to keep pace with because the instructional part was poorly done, there were no countdowns on the crisscross jumping jacks, half jacks, hop turns and jumps making it difficult to distinguish when to perform the next routine/move.  I've been playing the Workout II without the instructional part, just the music and attempting to figure out the moves sequences on my own.",1,Bollywood dance,1215993600,"07 14, 2008",2008,687,"['Yes', 'will', 'get', 'good', 'workout', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'was', 'looking', 'more', 'Indian', 'dance', 'routine/workout', 'saw', 'Fittv', 'Instructor', 'Sarina', 'Jina', 'DVD', 'several', 'Indian', 'dance', 'moves', 'crisscross', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'half', 'jacks', 'squats', 'However', 'workouts', 'were', 'difficult', 'keep', 'pace', 'instructional', 'part', 'was', 'poorly', 'done', 'were', 'countdowns', 'crisscross', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'half', 'jacks', 'hop', 'turns', 'jumps', 'making', 'difficult', 'distinguish', 'when', 'perform', 'next', 'routine/move', ""'ve"", 'been', 'playing', 'Workout', 'II', 'instructional', 'part', 'just', 'music', 'attempting', 'figure', 'out', 'moves', 'sequences', 'own']",Hemalayaa: Bollywood Burn
1109997,A1ARPLFACHIK7Y,B000WH5AX8,"apriles78 ""aes78""","[3, 3]","This is a nice set of cardio workouts. What's really great about this DVD is you get the genuine feel for Bollywood with playful and fun moves. Hemalayaa has included more of them in this than in some of her other DVDs. I'd rate this as the best of all the DVDs of hers I've purchased because you get more real Bollywood flavor.There are three workouts that include a lot of high-impact moves. Although Hemalayaa does occasionally remind you to stay with lower-impact if you aren't comfortable, there is no demonstration of modified moves, so you'll have to figure them out yourself unless you can stick with the high-impact version. But Bollywood is bouncy and high-impact, so I guess it's worth it to see the real thing.Besides three workouts, you get an extra Bollywood dance demonstration that's fun and cute. Hemalayaa is wearing the blue outfit she wears on the cover and the two other performers are wearing Indian garb. It's really the best part of the DVD. You get to see just how playful Bollywood dance really is.What I really like about the Bollywood films I've seen is they portray more traditional Indian values. The main characters usually never kiss until they are married and the dance numbers are much more playful than the suggestive ones Hollywood puts out. Romance is a whole lot more fun when it's portrayed like that... traditional love and marriage. The first Bollywood movie I saw was Bride and Prejudice (a charming remake of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice). This DVD reminded me of that.I really wish Hemalayaa would include dance numbers like this in all of her DVDs. This one was totally cute!

The stretching is integrated with the moves so if you don't like Yoga or stretching, this makes you do it anyway and get the benefit. The impacts on the knee and bare feet are conscientiously minimized by Hemalayaa with admonitions.Also, this dance tradition is more ""earthy"" than Western classical ballet in which the goal, noble enough in its own way, is to ""leap and pause"" like Baryshnikov: to leave the earth. Whereas here you start by touching the earth to ask its blessing, and the result is it doesn't hurt you. It's a mystery.You learn great moves and gestures with which to amuse your friends notably the ""lightbulb"" with a really cheesey smile that makes you feel like a film poster.Also, there's a bloke in this one which provides reassurance to blokes as to whether these are for blokes as well as the hairies, the glamouries...the ladies, that is.Only problem at this time for me is that this is a 45 minute workout.

1110003,AO9J89WUKF46J,B000WH5AX8,ReadingGranny,"[0, 0]","I am most certainly NOT in shape right now, but I love Bollywood movies, and I love the idea of dancing for fitness.  One original concern I had about this video was whether or not the instructions would be in English -- whew!  They are.  That's the first plus for me.  As much as I like Hindi language films, I don't speak Hindi or exercise to it.My second concern was whether I would be able to do it.  Not only am I not fit, but I am also not a dancer.  Well, I'm pleased to say that I can keep up.  Hemalayaa starts out slow and repetitive and then she takes the moves we've learned and puts them into choreography.  It really is fun and easy enough to keep up with, although I'm hoping to keep getting more polished as I continue working with this video.The third thing I especially like about this workout is that it's divided into three portions.  Since I'm just starting,  I'm doing one section per day.  I don't remember how long the last section is, but the first two are each about sixteen minutes long.  That's just perfect for where I am right now, and I am hoping to eventually gain strength and endurance enough to do the whole thing at once.Finally, besides being fun dance moves, these exercises really work the whole body.  Hemalayaa states that we'll be working the thighs and buttocks, but I feel the burn all over.  As we are doing knee bends or lunges, for example, we are also doing arm movements and twisting the torso.  It feels good all over.Incidentally, I also have arthritis, and so far the movements haven't felt damaging to my joints.  Of course, I really haven't taken the exercise to full energy yet or done as much jumping as Hemalayaa does, either.  She continually encourages the participant to do only what feels right, and she offers suggestions for alternative movements for those who can't do all of the choreography.  I really love this video, and I'm hoping not only to lose weight and get toned, but also to learn the full routine and someday perform it for my husband.

I wish I could say that it was likeable, but I find her style of narration rather annoying; something in her intonation and giggling rubs me the wrong way.  It's not necessarily in sync with the video and doesn't cue very well; often it's not until she and the other dancers are doing the move that the narration identifies the change.The workouts themselves are not necessarily well-paced.  The workouts go from bouncy dancing to yoga, then back to bouncy dancing.  This is also most assuredly NOT low-impact, so it's impossible to recommend for people with joint problems.  (It doesn't purport itself to be low-impact, at least, though neither does any preview or packing information present just how non-low-impact it is.)  That being said, the workouts also are rather a lot of fun, silly if not sexy, which goes a long way to redeem this particular video.Overall, I enjoyed this video the few times I did it, but finally had to set it aside when all the hopping got to be too much for me.

The cool down is brief for segments 1 &2 in the event you want to do segment 3.  The steps are easy and fun.  BE WARNED, MANY OF THE STEPS ARE HIGH IMPACT.

The teacher is in voice over and she is much louder than the music.  There is a music only option and when you hear it without her talking, it is quite good and rhythmic.Overall:  A good workout that is edited and choreographed much better than her bollywood workout dvd.
