I really did.Mike Judge is brilliant-- from B&B; to KOTH to Office Space, the guy's great.So I bought IDIOCRACY and watched it.I'm disappointed.The premise sounds great on paper-- intelligence gives up without a whimper, drowned in the gene pool by overbreeding hillbillies and gangbangers who accelerate our pop culture's race to the bottom-- but it doesn't provide much fertile ground for making jokes. Basically, we're shown this lousy future and... that's it.Joe (Luke Wilson) and Rita (Maya Rudolph) are average non-entities who become the smartest people in the world-- even though they aren't exceptional in any way; he's a slacker Army librarian and she's a hooker for a pimp named Upgrayyd.Ha... ha... ha.We see a miserable future where all-around idiot Frito (Dax Shepard) is a lawyer (or ""attornee"" as his jacket sleeve insists), who rants *against* his client at his trial (overseen by a judge played by Judge stalwart Stephen Root) and ensures his conviction and entry into ""Monday Night Rehabilitation""-- that is, gladiatorial games for the terminally dumb.Why not have characters against which Joe and Rita play off? A hidden enclave of ""smarties"" struggling to keep a feeble flicker of intelligence alive, or a gung-ho Marine from their time who's out-macho'ed by the brawn-worshipping braindead of this future? But no.There are some clever sight gags but I felt the entire thing would have been more amusing as a series of skits-- like an ongoing Saturday Night Live bit-- than as a movie.

How less intelligent people are reproducing at alarming rates and the higher intelligent people are having very few kids and late in their life. When first watching the movie I thought I was just watching a comedy but for me it definitely turned into a thought inducing movie for me.If your like me and stupid people really get on your nerves then you will love this movie.

Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","The theory:Those of us who paid attention in class learned that, according to Darwin, the more successful are supposed to outnumber and overwhelm the less successful because they are healthier, live longer and can afford to make more children. But... what if they were too busy to raise kids while the... hmmm... not so successful were given incentives to reproduce like crazy? Well... use your imagination and try to picture yourself our world a few centuries from now. Then... watch this movie. It's THAT bad only maybe we don't need to wait for 500 years to get there because we're almost there already.The implementation:The movie is really what Einstein would call 'a thought experiment'. Begin with real data (the less successful reproduce while the more successful don't), make some assumption (this will continue indefinitely) and... there it is, your dream world where the mentally different are not only in a majority but they are in complete control. I SWEAR, it's NOT about THIS place and time :)I am NOT going to reveal the plot but, take it from me, that you will laugh is a given. The question is are you going to laugh hysterically or only loudly. Of course, I am exaggerating a little. Not everyone will laugh but almost everyone that I know who watched this movie did.The negatives:The ending is just a tiny bit too tame. As in some of the characters could have been a lot stupider than they eventually turn out being but this is a small negative.The production values:It's not 'Lord of the Rings' quality, that's for sure. It's more like one or 2 notches above 'The Blair Witch' as far as the picture, the sound and the quality of the props are concerned. Same with the actors - I believe I saw a couple in other movies but no really big names. Most of the acting is good though and the actors talents do fit the script - that's why most people end up laughing hysterically while watching.The stars:It's five of them, with no reservations whatsoever. Highly recommended to all those who don't take themselves too seriously but happen to be concerned over our world's future.If you believe that this is your kind of comedy, take advantage of the current low DVD prices and entertain yourself.",5,Like...

Estes,"[0, 1]","Mike Judge, director of the cult classic ""Office Space"" as well as the creator of TV's ""Beavis & Butthead"" and ""King of the Hill,"" delivers perhaps his most outlandish and most imaginative work to date in ""Idiocracy."" Luke Wilson (""Old School"") and Maya Rudolph (""Away We Go"") play subjects of a military experiment gone wrong who find themselves waking up in the year 2505, when mankind has devolved to the point of uselessness and near-extinction, brought on by needless over-breeding, poor dietary choices and mind-numbing television. Wilson plays the slacker and Rudolph a prostitute, and both turn out to be the strongest and smartest in a world gone terribly, terribly wrong.""Idiocracy"" is the kind of wacky yet centered cautionary tale that only the mind of Mike Judge could produce, but unfortunately loses steam half way through when its narrative is given nowhere to go, giving way to a slightly clich&eacute;d Hollywood ending that doesn't quite gel with the overall tone of the rest of the movie. It's a shame that the film bogs itself down in simplicity when much of the material at hand is rife with social commentary and oh-so subtle jabs at its viewer as well as its production company, Twentieth Century Fox (who, in turn, abused the film so badly that it was an inevitable flop). There's heavy usage of CGI to convey a trash avalanche as well as a monster-truck jam of sorts that gives the movie an unintentionally cartoonish look and feel. Surprisingly, though, it works in the film's favor, giving the film a wacky tone when it could easily slide into gloomier territory. It also doesn't hurt to have left-field cameos from the likes of Justin Long, Stephen Root and Thomas Haden Church, either.In the end, it's a film with bold ideas that doesn't quite reach its potential. Still, though, like much of Judge's other work, it will have you thinking and questioning the world around you. Is ""Idiocracy"" ahead of the curve, foreshadowing the shape of things to come?

""brnn64""","[4, 5]","Much has been said of the plot, where an average joe Army librarian and a prostitute are chosen for a military experiment and wake up 500 years later in an America in the midst of a new dark age of ignorance.For years, thinkers have glumly predicted that American would go the way of the Roman Empire. This is a visualization of that concept.The film is supposed to be a comedy, but I only cracked a smile once in the whole film (where Terry Crews as the wild man/president goes into black preacher mode in the midst of his ""speech"").For the most part, this is a very depressing tale of a ""brave new world."" The Idiocrats don't talk. They mumble monosyllables mixed with profanity and gutter slang. Garbage is strewn everywhere and ruins of skyscrapers and freeways abound. Corporate and commercial slogans replace conversation. Television and movies consist of pornography and ""America's Favorite Videos"" type violent segments. Slack jawed illiterate receptionists have picture buttons on all of their computers and cash registers, articulate speech is ridiculed as effeminate.Yeah I know. Sounds like now.At one point, the Army librarian (renamed ""Not Sure"" by the Idiocrats) is sentenced to death by said Idiocrats to be run over by monster trucks and a flamethrowing wrestler in an area on national television. A clear connection to Ancient Rome and the Gladiators.A major point that was not commented on is about 2/3 on in the story when the Army Librarian tells his 21st century comrade that they should go back in time to warn the people to read more, go to school, and activate their minds so that this kind of horrible future could be avoided.Hear hear. I am a teacher and like many in my profession, I fear the likelihood of a backward new dark age of a future like this. Let's work now America to keep exercising our brains so that this film does not become a reality.ADDENDUM-Incidentally, I recently has a chance to read the original screenplay online by Mike Judge. Those who consider this film to be bleak, depressing, and unfunny would not like the original intention of this film at all. That version is even scarier, angrier, more vulgar, and grimmer than this and is far less of a comedy than a nightmarish warning of things to come. Mike laid it on THICK. Really heavy-handed Jonathan Swift/George Orwell/Rod Serling type stuff. The Idiocrats in the script are far more savage and subhuman than in the film and the dovetailing of humanity into the Idiocrats is treated with more detail. However, aside from a few distractions such as the subplot of Joe/Not Sure's girlfriend and the museum scene (both of which are in the deleted scenes of the DVD), the original script is a tad more of a coherent story than the finished product. Some of the dialogue in the finished product (such as Joe/Not Sure's pontifications on the need to read and go to school and Terry Crews' speech where he uses the machine gun) is better than originally written.

It seems that the intelligent didn't breed as much as the unintelligent, and the result five centuries from now is a society of astonishing vulgarity and coarseness, in a state of terminal decline. Here one has to add that the scientific premise behind this conceit is shaky: thinkers have noted and worried for centuries that the poor and unintelligent are having more babies than the rich and intelligent. Yet, despite this, IQ scores throughout the world have gone up, a probable result of increased education (and a refutation of genetic determinism). The movie is also somewhat racist: is it supposed to be a sign of decline the fact that the US president is now a black with a hispanic surname?.

1031780,A20UJP1JSTIOL6,B000K7VHOG,artanis65,"[44, 54]","I suspect Mike Judge has read some science fiction in his time, and this film reminded me of a satiric short story by C.M. Kornbluth from the 1950's, ""The Marching Morons,"" in which an average guy wakes up a thousand years in the future to find a world in which a very few smart people keep the world going for a whole lot of dumb people.  In Mike Judge's Idiocracy, an average guy and an average woman wake up in the future to find there are no smart people at all.  I really don't buy into the movie's premise that idiots have more children than smart people; if you follow that train of logic back 2000 years, every Roman must have been a genius.  Still, when you look around today, you have to wonder if something odd is going on.If you've noticed the sorry state of today's culture and worried about our increasingly dumbed down society, the movie often feels uncomfortably true and doesn't seem all that implausible.  I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels as if something's gone very wrong and that we're about to go over a cliff; obviously, Mike Judge feels that way too. Judge aims his satiric arrows at much of what's wrong with America in the 21st century;  rampant consumerism, bad TV, urban culture, irresponsibility, loud music, rudeness, and dumb people.  The movie skewers Fox News and Al Gore (who vocally resembles one of the 26th century morons) with equal relish.Luke Wilson is very good in the lead; he appropriately plays it perfectly seriously. I thought Terry Crews as the president was also quite funny. The DVD extras are not great, and the menu is cluttered, hard to navigate, and appears to have been designed by someone from the the 26th century.  The DVD would have benefited greatly from a director's commentary; this movie is well suited for that.This movie is a fascinating blend of a really smart premise with spottily successful low comedy. It aims high, often falls short of its target, but has plenty of laughs.

All the people around him are entirely clueless.  Is this some kind of joke?  Nope, it turns out he was taken to a world 500 years into the future where there's enormous mounds of trash everywhere, water has been exchanged for drinkable gatorate coming out of the fountains, and human behavior and intellect so low that it reaches a level of patheticness.

Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[1, 1]","This film caught me completely by surprise, as I had not even heard of it prior to seeing it on the shelves at Hollywood video.  Like most people, I was intrigued by it being a Mike Judge film.  The description seemed interesting, so we took a chance on it.  The story is about a remarkably unremarkable individual named Joe (Luke Wilson), a US Army admin troop selected for a top-secret experiment because of his profound ""averageness"".  The project involves human hibernation experimentation, whereby the subjects are to be studied for the effects while they are comatose for a year.  A prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph) is selected as the other subject, for reasons that are barely explained and play into a weak premise for the mishap catalyst.When Joe and Rita awake, they are 499 years further into the future than planned, and encounter an absurd dystopia as a result of society dumbing itself down and counter-productive breeding selection.  It is an interesting though oxymoronic society which is increasingly technologically advanced yet intellectually regressed.  Although the setting and premise strain credulity and are not logically plausible, it all makes for a very funny story and can be overlooked and/or forgiven.Joe starts out accidentally/mistakenly as a criminal, and is assigned a defense attorney named Frito Pendejo (Dax Shepard, in another great performance) who also happens to be the one who filed the charges against Joe.  To describe the situation as a conflict of interest is putting it very mildly, and Frito hilariously helps to convict Joe.  After a not-so-clever-but-effective escape from prison, Joe is a fugitive trying to get back to his own time period (and thus begins his search for the Time Machine).  Through a series of events also more humorous than clever, it is discovered that Joe is the smartest person in the country.  This begins his climb through the levels of government power, though with this also comes a great responsibility to save the country from its own titanic stupidity.The film makes a few points as a cynical social satire, though it prefers to establish itself more through relatively unsophisticated (but effective) humor than through thoughtful discourse.  As a social commentary, it is hugely exaggerated and recreational, though this is frankly preferable to the recent barrage of documentaries full of egocentric sanctimony purporting to be socially relevant principles.  The film should not be taken too seriously, and is not meant to be.  Mike Judge makes his point, but still decides to have fun with the film.  This movie probably deserves 3.5 stars, but nudged itself to 4 because of several great lines (the best one spoken by Justin Long in his brief but hilarious cameo appearance as a mentally deficient Doctor).

Idiocracy stars Luke Wilson as an ordinary army soldier recruited to be the guinea pig in an experiment that will freeze soldiers then wake them up in the future. Joe Bowers (Wilson) agrees and is frozen and then the pod he is hidden in is lost.  Bowers isn't woken up a year later like he was supposed to, but instead 500 years later.The narrator takes us through the fall of the American culture. It seems stupid people have a lot more kids than smart people, so 500 years later, Bowers awakens and is suddenly the smartest person in the world.  Immersed among millions of morons in a society that caters to the dumbest, lowest common denominator, Bowers travels through society trying to find a ""time machine"" that will take him back to the present.Enough of the plot synopsis.  Highlights include the elaborate set pieces taht depict the future including a hospital and the White House. Wilson is witty and funny and the true star of the film. Judge keeps the jokes coming fast, don't take your eyes off the background as many jokes are to be found there.Problems with the film include the fact that since in the future everyone is dumb, all the characters play a variation on the same character, a dolt with an IQ of about 80.  This detracts from the film in some parts since there really isn't any character development.This movie never made it to theaters.

He is chosen (along with a prostitute named Rita (played by Maya Rudolph)), to be part of a hibernation project that is supposed to last a year, but is bungled and forgotten before the year is up. 500 years later, Joe wakes up from the hibernation and finds himself in a world that is thoroughly dumbed down. Joe doesn't sound like a genius by our standards, but in this world he appears condescending for saying things like ""let me explain"". This movie basically serves as an indictment of the current state of our world. It's a movie that says, ""what if the world was made up only of pop culture zombies, everyone you see on 'Elimidate', people who think fart jokes and kicks in the crotch are the funniest jokes ever, and people who couldn't pronounce a word with more than 2 syllables?"" Well, sometimes it seems like we aren't so far from that when more people (at least in the US) know the names of Britney Spears's babies than the mayor of their city or what the term ""homosapien"" means. The movie is hilarious in showing how ridiculous and stupid people become, but you can't watch it without thinking of people you have encountered who actually act in these ways. So, in other words, the plot and the jokes are up to par, as is the acting (which includes the rapper Scarface, and David Herman - otherwise known as ""Michael Bolton"" in Office Space"").

That is to say, bottom-rung funnies. This isn't horrible, just something you should prepare yourself for when slipping IDIOCRACY into your DVD player.More of a 1984 for Dummies, Idiocracy has a great premise with poor execution. The premise is that intelligent people (those with an IQ above an amoeba) don't procreate as much as those who live in trailer parks, have questionable dental hygiene, and believe the height of entertainment is watching a monster truck rally.The stars are Luke Wilson as Private Joe Bowers and Maya Rudolph as Rita. Joe is average. So average that the military decides to pull him from his job (doing nothing) and inter him in a cryogenic coffin for one year as a test to see how far they've come with freezing people. They also need a female to round out the study so pull a prostitute named Rita from the streets and put her in a cryo-coffin next to Joe. Supposedly they're to be reawakened in one year. But the leader of the project is arrested and the project forgotten. The building where Joe and Maya lay cryo-sleeping is bulldozed, and their resting places vanish.Fast-forward 1,000 years and we find a massive garbage pile that suddenly falls, causing a landslide. Joe's coffin is ejected from the heap and he quickly wakes up. What he discovers is a society so dumbed-down that he's the smartest person on the planet (he's the only one who knows that watering plants causes them to grow). Maya's coffin reopens, too, and she returns to plying her trade but discovers she no longer needs to spread her legs, as only promising to do so gets her money.Joe is later elevated to the position of Vice-President of the United States (and eventually President), and he has to make the tough decision to stay 1,000 years in the future or to return to his own time via something called ""The Time Machine."" We later learn, too, that the time machine is simply a Disneyesque ride through a very jumbled and inaccurate world historical account.The premise definitely is intriguing, as some of what is touched upon can be seen in society already.

Simple, I think: because the story is dull and cliche in equal measure.There's little doubt that America is slouching toward a self-loathing, monosyllabic plutocracy, subjugated by runaway consumerism and intellectual incuriousness, but it's more complicated than that, with even stranger forces at work. For example, a great portion of our society has become, arguably, overeducated, though not with the results one would expect.

Perhaps the movie would have benefited had it explored paradoxes such as this.)

A weird thing happened however on the way to oblivion...the movie became a huge cultural hit once it appeared on DVD. It was such a smash that Judge was set to do another movie, ""The United States of Uhh-merica"" which would later become ""Idiocracy"". The irony here is that ""Idiocracy"" was also not supported by the studios, being released in only a few cities with little to no promotion. It failed, of course, and has been recently released onto DVD.So will lighting strike twice? Maybe, the movie is better than it's initial reception alludes to but it's not as consistent or as witty as ""Office Space"". The premise is broad but funny, society is de-evolving. Over the next 500 years dumber families will have more kids than smarter families ultimately sinking the accumulative IQ average down to record lows. So in the future, people's favorite TV show will be ""Oh... My Balls!"" and sports drink will replace water entirely. Enter Joe Bauers an average army Joe who ""volunteers"" for a suspended animation program; he and  another women from the early 21st century arise in the 26th century after a freak mishap. As a result Joe Bauers is now the smartest man on earth, which may not be as cool as it sounds.The comedy is more a kin to ""Beavis and Butthead"" than to ""The Office"". In other words it's often pretty crude but the social message is not to be ignored. The template for this odd little comedy exists today. Why do people still laugh at the guy getting hit in the balls on America's Home Videos? Why are people paying more for a bottle of water than a can of pop? Why do people drink Red Bull if it doesn't taste good?  We do these things because...as a whole we're not as smart as we'd like to think we are. We often depend upon advertising and image for reference. Judge is just holding a mirror up to our own simplistic media dependence and yes it's extreme and silly and broad but it's often quite hilarious.

Richardson ""flick hound""","[11, 11]","I somehow missed this when it came out, having dropped out of the rat race and moved to a small, hip (but unfortunately cinema-less town) for exactly the reasons that the creators of this film must have felt compelled to make it.  Yes, in realty as in the film, natural selection (besides the all too marginal Darwin Awards), largely seems to have ceased to play a role in human reproduction and the general advancement of the species; yes, it seems that exactly the wrong people, i.e. the Jerry Springer-ites, the People's Court mobs, the Fast Food Nation legions, the WWF fans, the monster truck afficionados, Scarface and gangster rap wannabes, the religious nuts, and wild eyed, gun rights obsessed country kooks, etc. etc. are indeed the ones out-reproducing the gifted, thoughtful folks who should be reproducing by at least ten to one.  The plain dumb, blind greed of recent times: the dull drift towards instant self gratification, the endemic, autonomic texting and repetitive, pointless gaming, the encroaching shallowness, incuriousity, dispassionateness, and uncultured obliviousness of so many people just idly filling their time, gratifying their medulla oblongatas, and stuffing their faces.... Idiocracy explores the implications of these dummied down  trends in broad, slightly disturbing, yet hilariously inventive and intuitive strokes.  As a recent 8 year high school teacher, I was absolutely thunderstruck by this film. The movie seemed to be welling up from my subconscious, like a lucid dream or vision, or comic nightmare, rather than from a DVD player.  It's sci-fi meets broadly and boldly stroked, inventive humor and sharp social satire. By the end, I was laughed out and purged; I felt in good company; somehow I felt bolstered, comforted, and redeemed.Luke Wilson, an average guy in the midst of the criticically dumb Bush years; a guy with no big dreams or ambition, looking for an easy ticket in an army records facility to coast through life towards a decent retirement, is ""volunteered"" for an army experiment to be cryogenically frozen, along with a prostitute trying to avoid jail time, and is to be awakened in one  year. When the officer in charge of the experiment is busted for pimping with his new friends (the prostitute's pimp and associates) the project is forgotten and the building is bulldozed to make a Fudruckers.  Luke wakes up in a trash avalanche 500 year later in a world that has been steadily dummied down, in which the people speak a mix of hillbilly, inner city slang, product names and guttural noises. Though some people may miss the overall satire and only see the ""dumb guy"" humor (like the ones being satirized)  the movie is as sophisticated as Gulliver's Travels or a wacky Clockwork Orange, using both ""dumb"" humor (though pehaps ""innocent abroad"" might be a better term) as well as scathingly dead-on and inventively hilarious satirical comedy to explore our current state and meditate, though somewhat light-heartedly, on where it all might lead us.Luke Wilson is a gem and carries the movie throughout the wild situational and character comedy with a straight faced innocence and sincerity that recalls the best of Buster Keaton.  If the masses do not know or regard him as one of our most talented comic actors, or recognize the film as a cult comic masterpiece, it is because they are as dopey and oblivious as most of the characters in the film.  Masterpiece is a risky word, but like many under-appreciated films of the past, this film, I strongly predict (if people don't get any stupider) will only grow in stature as a document from a time when things began to go seriously wrong, though the perceptiveness and comic spirit of the film is in itself cause for hope.  It might seem raunchy and rough for some of our more effete film viewers, but look around:  this film scores a rare comic and social bull's eye, however appropriate or improper one may perceive its humor.  If you consider how well and to what larger purpose the ""dumb guy"" humor is used (unlike the largely pointless ""Hangover"" or ""Pineapple Express"") this is as sharp and as funny a social satire as has been produced in a good many years.",5,dumb guy humor used to brilliant ends....,1321315200,"11 15, 2011",2011,4182,"['somehow', 'missed', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'having', 'dropped', 'rat', 'race', 'moved', 'small', 'hip', 'unfortunately', 'cinema-less', 'town', 'exactly', 'reasons', 'creators', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'compelled', 'make', 'Yes', 'realty', 'film', 'natural', 'selection', 'too', 'marginal', 'Darwin', 'Awards', 'largely', 'have', 'ceased', 'play', 'role', 'human', 'reproduction', 'general', 'advancement', 'species', 'yes', 'exactly', 'wrong', 'people', 'i.e', 'Jerry', 'Springer-ites', 'People', 'Court', 'mobs', 'Fast', 'Food', 'Nation', 'legions', 'WWF', 'fans', 'monster', 'truck', 'afficionados', 'Scarface', 'gangster', 'rap', 'wannabes', 'religious', 'nuts', 'wild', 'eyed', 'gun', 'rights', 'obsessed', 'country', 'kooks', 'etc', 'etc', 'are', 'indeed', 'ones', 'out-reproducing', 'gifted', 'thoughtful', 'folks', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'reproducing', 'least', 'ten', 'one', 'plain', 'dumb', 'blind', 'greed', 'recent', 'times', 'dull', 'drift', 'towards', 'instant', 'self', 'gratification', 'endemic', 'autonomic', 'texting', 'repetitive', 'pointless', 'gaming', 'encroaching', 'shallowness', 'incuriousity', 'dispassionateness', 'uncultured', 'obliviousness', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'just', 'idly', 'filling', 'time', 'gratifying', 'medulla', 'oblongatas', 'stuffing', 'Idiocracy', 'implications', 'dummied', 'down', 'trends', 'broad', 'slightly', 'disturbing', 'yet', 'hilariously', 'inventive', 'intuitive', 'strokes', 'recent', '8', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'was', 'absolutely', 'thunderstruck', 'film', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'welling', 'up', 'subconscious', 'lucid', 'dream', 'vision', 'comic', 'nightmare', 'rather', 'DVD', 'player', 'sci-fi', 'meets', 'broadly', 'boldly', 'stroked', 'inventive', 'humor', 'sharp', 'social', 'satire', 'end', 'was', 'laughed', 'out', 'purged', 'felt', 'good', 'company', 'somehow', 'felt', 'bolstered', 'comforted', 'redeemed.Luke', 'Wilson', 'average', 'guy', 'midst', 'criticically', 'dumb', 'Bush', 'years', 'guy', 'big', 'dreams', 'ambition', 'looking', 'easy', 'ticket', 'army', 'records', 'facility', 'coast', 'life', 'towards', 'decent', 'retirement', 'volunteered', 'army', 'experiment', 'be', 'cryogenically', 'frozen', 'prostitute', 'trying', 'avoid', 'jail', 'time', 'be', 'awakened', 'one', 'year', 'When', 'officer', 'charge', 'experiment', 'busted', 'pimping', 'new', 'friends', 'prostitute', 'pimp', 'associates', 'project', 'forgotten', 'building', 'bulldozed', 'make', 'Fudruckers', 'Luke', 'up', 'trash', 'avalanche', '500', 'year', 'later', 'world', 'been', 'steadily', 'dummied', 'down', 'people', 'speak', 'mix', 'hillbilly', 'inner', 'city', 'slang', 'product', 'names', 'guttural', 'noises', 'people', 'may', 'miss', 'overall', 'satire', 'only', 'see', 'dumb', 'guy', 'humor', 'ones', 'being', 'satirized', 'movie', 'as', 'sophisticated', 'Gulliver', 'Travels', 'wacky', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'using', 'dumb', 'humor', 'pehaps', 'innocent', 'abroad', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'term', 'as', 'well', 'scathingly', 'dead-on', 'inventively', 'hilarious', 'satirical', 'comedy', 'explore', 'current', 'state', 'meditate', 'somewhat', 'light-heartedly', 'where', 'might', 'lead', 'us.Luke', 'Wilson', 'gem', 'movie', 'wild', 'situational', 'character', 'comedy', 'straight', 'faced', 'innocence', 'sincerity', 'best', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'masses', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'regard', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'comic', 'actors', 'recognize', 'film', 'cult', 'comic', 'masterpiece', 'are', 'dopey', 'oblivious', 'most', 'characters', 'film', 'Masterpiece', 'risky', 'word', 'many', 'under-appreciated', 'films', 'past', 'film', 'strongly', 'predict', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'stupider', 'will', 'only', 'grow', 'stature', 'document', 'time', 'when', 'things', 'began', 'go', 'seriously', 'wrong', 'perceptiveness', 'comic', 'spirit', 'film', 'cause', 'hope', 'might', 'seem', 'raunchy', 'rough', 'more', 'effete', 'film', 'viewers', 'look', 'film', 'rare', 'comic', 'social', 'bull', 'eye', 'however', 'appropriate', 'improper', 'one', 'may', 'perceive', 'humor', 'consider', 'how', 'well', 'what', 'larger', 'purpose', 'dumb', 'guy', 'humor', 'used', 'largely', 'pointless', 'Hangover', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'sharp', 'funny', 'social', 'satire', 'been', 'produced', 'good', 'many', 'years']",N/A

When this Adam & Eve wake up, they discover that the world has &#34;dumbed down&#34; in their absence, thanks to the increased breeding of less-intelligent people and decreased breeding of more-intelligent ones. People spend their time watching television in special toilet-recliners, eating food from tubs with their hands, and visiting fast food places that specialize in prostitution. The President of the United States is an ex-porn star and wrestler; his Cabinet consists of severely limited people and one adolescent who &#34;won a contest.&#34; Costco is now a Mos Eisley city all its own, complete with its own law school.

The soundtrack is amazing, the bleak future is very well-portrayed and detailed, and the storyline, while seriously flawed (it assumes that stupid people always breed more stupid people, while some of our smartest people have come from really disadvantaged backgrounds, and that smart people always breed more smart people, which is quite obviously untrue), makes its point. The pace is quick and energetic, with no real slowdowns; the characters are compelling and well-drawn--not for nothing is President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho considered one of the best movie presidents of all time on one popular YouTube channel. Considering its treatment of corporate culture and known brands like Hardee's and Starbuck's, I can easily see why this movie didn't get the wide release it really deserved.

Unlike inKing of the Hill - The Complete First Season, subtlety isn't his style in Idiocracy. Instead, he goes all out for every gag in the book. Every nuance is there to portray society as simply stupid.What works in the film is the premise. That's even what carries it through until the end. You probably already know what it's about: society has gotten dumber and dumber (sic) until by the year 2500, the world (or at least America) is on the brink of collapse because they can't solve any of their problems, ones that they caused in the first place. In comes an average guy from the year 2000, and he's hailed as a genius. He must now solve all of humanity's problems, from the death of crops to the overflow of garbage.It's a good premise.What doesn't work, though, is the way the movie becomes a series of gags: sight, sound, etc. I guess a world of really stupid people would actually be full of gags, but it really just seems like a bunch of stupid people from the year 2000, not from the year 2500. Nothing has really changed in those 500 years except that people still can't solve their own problems.So all in all, Idiocracy is a decent film with a great premise. The genius of it is also its problem: it is couched in a faraway land (like allegory or a lot of satire) that is really available right here at home. But the truth is generally easier to take when it seems faraway.The other thing I like about this post is how people like to think they're above the critique. Just look at some reviews for the movie.

You're supposed to be rating the film, not the unrelated technical difficulties with your machine or media type.  All you're doing is skewing the ratings with unrelated problems.

I had never heard of it. After reading some reviews I was skeptical but it looked funny in a goofy type of way but I figured the boys would like it, so we did watch it on a homeschool day when we had low energy.The story is that a military guy in 2005 is assigned to an experiment. He is put to sleep for a supposed short time. Government budget cuts resulted in the project being terminated and he is awoken 500 years in the future, in America. Since the stupid ugly Americans have bred at a faster rate than the educated childless white collar professionals who are infertile by the time they desire to have a baby, society has been overtaken by the idiots.Now you can see why the movie piqued a bit of my interest.The movie was in poor taste, I wonder if it could have been done without being so crash. The female lead was an African-American hooker. There were other sexual references that were gross. Possibly the nastiest thing was a chair a guy sat in to watch TV non-stop with his pants down and the seat was a toilet. He ate while he defecated. Need I say more? Oh but there is more: numerous references to men masturbating, not funny.The only good parts of the movie were when it was revealed that no one drank or used water, not even to irrigate crops, due to lobbying by a company to drink something that looked like Gatorade to me. The crops died but the idiots could not equate it to needing water.This was torture for me to watch and I fiddled doing other tasks while it played on the screen. I finally could take no more and didn't watch the ending.

Joe, Luke Wilson, is put in hibernation at the behest of military scientists and wakes up decades later to find that everyone is much dumber than they were in the year 2006. So dumb, for instance, that they don't know to water crops with water rather than the latest sports drink; and cities fall victim to landslides made of human garbage. The only person accompanying Luke Wilson on his journey is a prostitute, played by Maya Rudolph. Once in the future where our heroes don't belong, hilarity--as they say--ensues. Or should, but doesn't. I expected more, given the movie is the brain child of Mike Judge, who made one of the best word-of-mouth satires ever, Office Space. Idiocracy has some funny bits, such as the historically inaccurate museum that we see at the end, but it never really takes off. It's the kind of movie that wants it both ways: it mocks people who laugh at crotch-kick humor and then features repeated crotch-kick jokes. If a filmmaker is going to portray Americans as stupid Philistines, he should make a movie that is smart and insightful. Idiocracy is neither of those things. The characters range from one-dimensional idiots to our two dimensional heroes (Maya Rudolph's talents, in particular, are wasted). The movie is simply not on target. In many ways, popular culture is even dumber than what this movie spoofs, but at the same time, to think American culture is dumb beyond saving does an injustice to much of the good stuff out there. As far as TV goes, sure, we have to put up with stuff like Jerry Springer and Jackass. But there's also Curb Your Enthusiasm, Deadwood, and Freaks and Geeks DVDs.

""King of the Hill"" is more mainstream and probably more generally loved, but the audience includes very different people.  However, the satire and bite is still there if you listen for it.His first movie, ""Office Space"" did not do well at the box office, but has since become a revered classic to almost everyone who has ever worked in a cubicle and will probably continue to find a new audience as young people enter the workforce and get to experience that special kind of misery for themselves.""Idiocracy"" is a very different creature.  It is even more rude and crude than ""Beavis and Butthead"", and isn't as invitingly delightful as ""Office Space"".  Does that mean that it is a failure?  I don't think so.  Judge manages to do the Rip van Winkle thing and send his hero into the future to make fun of his own time (as is standard for this plot device).The principle target for Judge is the dumbing down of the nation through its mass culture.  Corporations in our time cannot resist, for example, moving into the pornography business because it makes so darn much money.  In the story, they have combined sex with getting coffee, sandwiches, and much else.  Language has devolved into a base amalgam of crudities and grunts since that is all that is needed to express what passes for thought.Violence is enshrined as the principle delight of the masses and the President is a kind of big time wrestler and flipping the bird is a standard greeting.  Science in any meaningful sense is gone and the masses simply use the technologies left them.  All they can do is market the pieces still useful for business even as it imperils their very existence.  The two who are awakened in the future are the smartest people in that world.  In their world they were average at best.While some of the movie is quite funny, much of it is harsh and exasperating.  It is not a great film, but makes its points well.  Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph are the leads and work their way through the perils of the future with some difficulties, but it turns out that what they know is so desperately needed that they find a way to rise to the top of that world without even wanting to.If you like crude social satire and didn't find ""Beavis and Butthead"" too terribly crude, you might enjoy this.

As others have noted, its predecessors include the C. M. Kornbluth story ""The Marching Morons"" (1951) and the Woody Allen movie ""Sleeper,"" along with ""Demolition Man"" and the recent TV cartoon series ""Futurama.""  The movie it most resembles, however, in both style and spirit, is probably ""Death Race 2000,"" released in 1975.Like each of these works, ""Idiocracy"" uses its premise to satirize and comment on trends in present-day society. And to some measure, it succeeds. There are some genuinely funny moments, along with a lot of gross-out humor.  Production values are minimal, and if you're looking for a logical, coherent story, this is not the movie for you. Clearly, a society where everyone is as stupid as these people appear to be could not function at all. Who would design and build the giant vehicles used in the Rehabilitation arena, for example?I agree with the consensus rating of 3.5 stars that Amazon users have given ""Idiocracy,"" although that figure is a bit deceptive., as it represents an average of extremes. People either think this movie is brilliant, or they think it sucks.  I disagree with both groups.  It's fairly clever in places, but hardly original in concept; see the works cited above.

Studies have shown (or so I've been told) that domestic animals are not as bright as the wild kind.  And guess what?  We domesticate ourselves, or rather our culture does.Recently there was a story in the news about a study that showed that the brains of obese people are 16 years older than the brains of people of normal weight (these were people in their seventies).  Furthermore the brains of the obese had about eight percent less mass than the brains of people of normal weight.  Merely ""fat"" people had half the deficiency.  So when director Mike Judge depicts all those fat and dumb people in the future, he may be on to some serious prognosticating.As for the film itself, well, it is strangely compelling.  This future world of idiots with everything falling apart seems almost real.  It should be emphasized that all science fiction about the future is of necessity an extrapolation from the present.  In fact, the real power of futuristic tales is what they tell us about the present.  Idiocracy is no exception.  The dumbed-down, couch-potato, dimly-aware creatures shown in the film are us!  (Present company excepted of course.)Unfortunately Idiocracy is a sort of one trick pony.

In fact after one viewing I know this movie will haunt me out there in realityville where people park in handicapped parking spots, ""orphans"" have parents who ignore them and people think emotional films with wet puppy scenes are ""really good."" I'm going to be seeing the parallels everywhere, and I mean everywhere. But the really good part is this film deserves multiple viewings. There are a lot of little gems easily missed. I'm sure many will miss the scene where the cops shoot up an empty car much to the growing mindless delight and eventual participation of all who observe them. This scene passes so quickly but it's a nice little gem and there are many like it.Mike Judge is at the very least one of the most insightful of modern satirists, reminding me of Twain or Vonnegut though his targets move more slowly. It's like shooting fish in a barrel, and you can't blame Mr. Judge for that. However one wonders how much Judge had to alter this movie to get it past the idiot suits at Fox. My guess is every scene was an epic struggle... and Fox won most of the time. There is just too much TRUTH about our true masters. The suits can't stand that. We are not ruled by our politicians anymore, the corporations are our rulers. It probably could have been a better film but I can't blame Mike, cause I know his work and he's good, even great.And so, although fast food and retailers are savaged by the film, the entities that are skewered the most savagely and most subtly are the idiotic ""entertainment"" companies. He snuck a few past them.Probably few will be aware that the soundtrack is one of the funniest things about this film, complete with highly ""dramatic"" crescendos during idiotically simplistically morality scenes that are actually kind of sweet but are handled in the ham fisted way Hollywood knows best.

It became a deserving cult hit.Now he tries for a broader kind of satire -- the dumbing down of America, which nobody can deny if they've looked at test scores. ""Idiocracy"" is weird, crude, and a lot smarter than virtually any other movie released in the past year...The Pentagon is preparing a special hibernation project, so it can ""save"" its best soldiers for wartime. As a test subject, they select Joe (as in ""average"") Bowers (Luke Wilson), who is the absolute average of average. Along with a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph) he is put into hibernation for one year.... except then the program gets shut down, and they are forgotten.Joe wakes up five hundred years in the future, only to find that mankind has changed radically. Well, maybe not so much. Turns out that welfare caused the trash hordes to reproduce a lot faster than the intellectuals. The path of evolution was thrown off. Now Rita and Joe find that they, the average, are the smartest people on the whole planet. God help them.First off, don't expect a retread of ""Office Space."" This is not ""Office Space."" It never tries to be ""Office Space.""This is Judge being cruder, ruder and more cynical, with jibes at welfare, blockbuster movies, dumbed-down speech, corporate logos, government, hillbillies, and corporate megastores. It's even got a TV show called ""Ow, My Balls,"" which involves.... well, you can guess what it involves.What isn't immediately obvious is that this humor exists to satirize itself. We do have shows like ""Jackass"" (which would be high art in ""Uh-merica""), after all. Judge is winking and double-winking all the time, as he slathers ""Idiocracy"" in his over-the-top, cynical art. And you know what? It's hysterically funny, and gets more so once you've seen it more than once.And it's got a pretty scary theme. ""Survival of the fittest"" has been overturned by the forces of stupidity? Well, I've encountered people on the same intellectual level as the Uhmericans of the future, and I find the idea terrifying. But that terror also makes you think about the dumbing-down of society... and not many satires can do that.The plot tends to meander somewhat, as Joe and Rita get acquainted with the people of the future. Fortunately the movie does stay afloat, and Rudolph and Wilson are quite funny as the ""straight men"" to a planet that is one big joke.The idea of a world populated by the descendents of Britney Spears is enough to make most people break out in cold sweats.

Although, that should have made it even more impactful...I don't know, but I DO know that this film started becoming unbearable to watch. I wanted to like this film, but I guess I'm not smart enough to appreciate the irony; or I'm not dumb enough to thouroughly enjoy it (not saying you guys are dumb, I'm saying that dumb movies still have their audience. ie: Date Movie, Epic Movie, etc.)",1,Coulda been a GREAT short film...,1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,1089,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'try', 'weave', 'words', 'fabulous', 'review', ""'ll"", 'just', 'spit', 'out', 'thoughts', 'review', 'top', 'said', 'film', 'uneasy', 'laughed', 'few', 'times', 'future', 'was', 'depressing', 'just', 'wanted', 'so', 'bad', 'movie', 'end.I', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'country', 'heading', 'direction', 'full', 'advertisements', 'sex', 'sale', 'Starbucks', 'even', 'H', 'R', 'Block', 'avalanche', 'garbage.But', 'dumb', 'movie', 'just', 'got', 'old', 'fast', 'such', 'important', 'statement', 'be', 'made', 'think', 'film', 'fell', 'short', 'started', 'floundering', '40', 'minutes.This', 'was', 'urgent', 'satire', 'just', 'shame', 'lost', 'impact', 'once', 'more', 'dummies', 'entered', 'picture', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'impactful', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'DO', 'know', 'film', 'started', 'becoming', 'unbearable', 'watch', 'wanted', 'like', 'film', 'guess', ""'m"", 'not', 'smart', 'enough', 'appreciate', 'irony', ""'m"", 'not', 'dumb', 'enough', 'thouroughly', 'enjoy', 'not', 'saying', 'guys', 'are', 'dumb', ""'m"", 'saying', 'dumb', 'movies', 'still', 'have', 'audience', 'ie', 'Date', 'Movie', 'Epic', 'Movie', 'etc']",N/A

Watched without the children due to some of the language. (if you want to educate your children on this subject matter watch Wall-e the animated movie with them, you all will love the movie).This movie tells of many truths that I see right today!I found this movie to be right on time and is the wake up call needed for society. This movie should have been made years ago, because for the last decade or more this is what this upside down world has turned to.. And this just did not just start, this has been going on for the past ten even fifteen years.. This did not just start.. It is just that many ignored this many moons ago and many do not want to take the necessary steps to turn this around.This movie will not disappoint you especially if you are already awaken. If you are not awaken, this will wake you up. This movie is NOT a waste of time, take time to watch this and be informed of what is happening to the society, with all of the technology, many don't use their brains any more. Many seem to want things handed to them with no effort of their own. This movies shows that and more, this movie shows the break down of society that we see today.If you have not seen this movie, do your self and family a favor and get this fast! I think the reason many don't know of this movie or the reason this movie was not heavily promoted was because some people want society to continue living in a bubble and to continue to be dumb down.Look at all the skills sets that are being lost and have been lost, the skill of cooking, many eat out more than prepare their meals at home. The price of convenience! Many don't know how to cook and don't want to learn. The skill of shoe repair, many just buy another pair instead of getting them repaired, hard to find a shoe repair store now days, sewing, gardening, canning, archery, carpentry, welding, and many more skills that our ancestors had, we have lost.. We are in the tech and modern world and the take a pill to solve all of your problem world.

1031876,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000K7VHOG,General Zombie,"[9, 11]","Enough people have been over how the release of this film was eternally delayed and, for all intents and purposes, reduced to a straight to DVD release that I won't go into all that to extensively.  Suffice to say, Mike Judge, and everyone involved here, got hosed, and Idiocracy is certainly far better than the vast majority of the crap littering the multiplexes.  It's still kinda baffling though, considering Judge's past successes with Beavis & Butthead, King of the Hill and Office Space and the money they'd already spent on it that they wouldn't even try to give it even a decent limited release, but whatever.  It's available now, anyway, and it's worth a look if you've enjoyed other Judge related material.You gotta already know the premise if you're reading this, but I'll go over it anyway:  Luke Wilson plays Joe Bowers, a thoroughly average, insignificant military librarian who is selected, along with streetwalker Rita (Maya Rudolph), to be part of an experiment in cryogenics where they're to be frozen for a year.  Various administrative problems come up, however, and the project is forgotten entirely, so that Joe and Rita don't awaken until 2505.  Things are not well, however, as over the past 500 years dullards and trailer trash have continued to breed wildly while the intelligent held back, carefully waiting for just the right moment.  They waited too long and bred too little, so now the world is completely overrun with morons, so much so that Joe and Rita are now apparently the two most intelligent people in the world.  Joe sees only one solution, albeit a rather improbable one:  He needs find a time machine and get the hell out of there.  And so we're off.As you've no doubt heard or guessed, Idiocracy is a rather vicious and blunt satire of modern culture.  As other reviewers have pointed out, though it may take this long for intelligence to be thoroughly bred out of human society, it sure wouldn't take 500 years for American culture to degenerate this far.  Examples:  Speech has been reduced to a barely coherent, ultra-profane mishmash of urban and rural slang; product placement and corporate sponsorship are now omnipresent, so much so that now cabinet members spout on about how such and such a thing is ""brought to you by Carl's Jr.""; the most popular show on TV is, apparently, ""Ow! My Balls!"" on the Violence network, and news shows are now hosted by bronzed, shirtless pro-wrestler types.  Furthermore, society is on the verge of disaster, as the current populace is just too stupid to deal with issues of pollution, agriculture etc. And so on.  This all points to the main flaw in the film: it's pretty one note, and the story as such exists pretty much just to propel us from one satiric scenario to the next.  Fundamentally, there isn't anything overwhelming sophisticated about the satire; they just take anything that currently exists and increase the crudity, violence and sexuality in it 1000 fold.  Still, Judge and co-writer Etan Cohen are clearly smart guys, and they're able to inject genuine cleverness into the sometimes obvious subject matter.  I'd go into greater specifics, but explaining a joke never really works and tends to ruin it when you do hear it, so you'll just have to take a chance.There isn't too much to be said about the technical aspects of the film.  If you like the humor and ideas you'll like it, if not you won't.  This is a pretty low-rent future, so it's rarely convincing, but, of course, this sorta heavy satire isn't meant to be accepted on a realistic or dramatic level.  Besides, having a frequently cheesy, unbelievable looking world is pretty appropriate from a thematic standpoint, I think.  There isn't too much to say about the performances either, as most of the characters are borderline-retarded at best, so overwhelmingly broad, simple performance are par the course.  Luke Wilson plays his typical dull-witted, average guy role.  He's appealing enough as such, though if you never liked him doing this before this film won't likely convert you.  Maya Rudolph is co-lead, and she doesn't really have all that much to do since she mostly just plays straight man to all the wackiness around her, but she does that adequately enough, I suppose.  Of the supporting roles, Terry Crews is probably most notable as the heavily be-muscled, pro-wrestler/porn star/president of the USA.  There's not much to say about him apart from that he was funny. I laughed. Hahahaha you see.As this is a very one-dimensional film it's a good thing that it's a scant 78 minutes, not including the credits.  Even at such a length it feels a bit too long, largely because the few attempts at outright drama that they include don't really work, and these things predominate at the end.  Still, the good easily outweighs the bad, and it doesn't stay around too long after wearing out it's welcome.Well, that's all I've got.  Once again, Judge fans will probably like it, I dunno about anyone else.  Some will tell you that this could've been so much more, and maybe they're right, but it's got enough to recommend it now.Grade: B",4,Worth a watch for Judge fans,1168992000,"01 17,

I chuckled at some of the satire, and I LOLed at some of the vulgarity. I was not amused at all by the story's classism based in eugenics. Such mocking (of the working and &#34;lower&#34;) class is ugly. Such speculation is ugly and inaccurate. Smart parents and a &#34;cultured&#34; upbringing can produce &#34;dumb&#34; kids. &#34;Simple&#34;/stupid parents can produce brilliant offspring. Idiocracy's society could not actually happen. However, Judge makes a comment on the Bush Years in his 2006 movie. And, he comments on where American culture heads generally. Idiocracy is meant as a fanciful tale of warning. And, hyperbole serves Judge's rhetorical point. People understand his warning because it is made in an exaggerated and obvious manner. So anyway, I find Idiocracy more interesting to discuss than to see. However, the film is decently amusing as comedic entertainment.",3,"See Idiocracy. It is a significant, much-discussed film.

I'd never heard of it until I gave it a rent and it's wall to wall hilarious, I kid you not.Luke Wilson plays magnificently average Army guy Joe Bowers, who is encouraged to take part in a hibernation experiment because of his complete ordinariness. Along with Rita, an equally average hooker (!), he is sent to sleep in a large incubator with the intention of being woken up in a year. But during his slumber there is a scandal on the base and it's closed down, the incubators forgotten about.Flash forward 500 years and the human race has been incredibly dumbed-down, following the orders of super-conglomerates, talking in a warped language of unintelligible slang syntax, wanting nothing more than to sit in front of a big screen TV and watch moronic shows while being bombarded with commercials for unessential products while the planet turns into a giant trash heap. Doesn't sound like it could ever happen could it? Breaking free of his incubator and let loose in this strange world, Joe now finds himself the most intelligent person alive, but instead of using this newfound talent to make friends and make the world a better place he is shunned by society for being 'faggy'. As Lisa Simpson once put it, as intelligence goes up, happiness goes down.We really do live in a world where the REAL brains, scientists, doctors and honest leaders are cast aside to make way for footballers, movie-stars and backstabbing politicians. Eerie foreshadowing, no doubt about it.Desperate to get back to his own time, Joe teams up with Rita to find a supposed time machine. But he is made 'Secretary of the Interior' by wrestling champion, porn-star extraordinaire and President of the United States Camancho. The country is the middle of a devastating dust-bowl since no crops are growing. But that's because they are being fed with Brawndo (Gatorade) because the Brawndo cooperation deemed water a threat to their profits and bought the rights to it. A problem easily solved. But who's going to believe that?It's a shame this film didn't find legs in the cinemas, but like Mike Judge's other cult hit, Office Space, I'm sure it will find an audience on DVD. Judge seems to have a strange, unpredictable sense of humor. I'm a big fan of King of the Hill and Daria and if you are too then you should definitely check out Idiocracy. After all, it's fun for us intelligent folks to laugh at the dumb. Though I fear we are fighting a losing battle.And how can you turn down any movie with a character called 'Beef Supreme'?The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound.

Those people are the same close-minded fools who dismiss Fight Club as simply a bunch of guys fighting one another.  This movie, when you peel back the layers, is much, much deeper.The 21st century, as described in Idiocracy, is a crucial turning point for civilization.  It's a time when human evolution bucks the trend of natural selection, and rewards the morons who simply reproduce the most.  It's a world where the constant barrage of MTV-style editing in mainstream entertainment, video games, internet bombardment (i.e. adware, spyware, flashing technology), and the frenetic, over-stimulated daily life has turned most of society into blathering idiots.  It's sad to say, but it's not far from the truth.Much like other dytopian-themed books and movies, Idiocracy concentrates on an exaggerated future that is not difficult to imagine.  It satirizes current society and expands upon the negative aspects plaguing us all.Joe Bowers (Luke Wilson) is an average Army soldier in 2005 who agrees to participate in a human hibernation experiment, and along with Joe, a deal is made to get a comparable female to participate.  Rita (Maya Rudolph) is a prostitute who is bought out by the government from her pimp Upgrayedd (Two D's for a double-dose of pimping).  After the one year dry freeze, they were to be awoken and the experiment could have been analyzed, but that didn't work out.  It is only when the Great Garbage Avalanche of 2505 takes place that Joe and Rita wake up to a drastically changed world.The world of 2505 is decaying in every way possible.  Buildings are torn down and destroyed, some held together by large ropes.  Economic issues have long since become moot, as conglomerations like Costco, Starbucks, and a renamed FuddRuckers (it's what we all first thought of when we saw the name) have taken over everything.

But when that fart joke is 90 minutes long and wins 8 Academy Awards, including one for Best Screenplay, then I'd say we are in trouble. Many of this film's reviewers think that Idiocracy itself is a 90 minute long fart joke, but then, they probably missed the point of director Mike Judge's classic Beavis and Butthead too. In other words, while much of the humor is indeed base, it is the audience itself that is the butt (pun intended) of the joke.All the reviews I've seen of this film take its premise of a moronic future literally. What they miss is that this movie is less about our pathetically inept descendants and more a brutally funny look at our media-saturated, corporately-controlled, anti-intellectual, out-of-shape present. The lawyer of the future sits in his recliner cum toilet, stuffing his face with artificial food-goop whilst ogling the Violence Channel, and it doesn't take a great leap of the imagination for me to see in this Joe Sixpack's vision of utopia. Advertising drops any hint of cerebration and subtlety, giving way to raw emotional appeals---""If you don't smoke Tarryltons, f*ck you!"" and ""Welcome to Costco, I love you."" Politics and entertainment are inseparable, with a pro-wrestler/porn star President and a thug-filled House of Representin', and being able to speak articulately makes you a ""fag."" Like I said, it isn't that far a leap into the future.Of course there were jokes that fell flat, probably because they were targeted toward the trailer-trash and hip-hop demographics that the movie has in its sights, and much of the humor is painfully obvious, but the film more than compensates with its emphasis on details. The jokes embedded in the TV screens, magazine covers, and billboards of the future had me pausing the DVD in order to get a closer look, belly-laugh, catch my breath, and wipe the tears out of my eyes. Luke Wilson plays his character as straight as he can, which only makes the situations funnier.This movie is far from perfect, but it will definitely appeal to those who suspect that we're living in an idiocracy right now.",4,"It's about the present, stupid",1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,2148,"['Okay', 'admit', 'enjoy', 'good', 'fart', 'joke', 'now', 'then', 'when', 'fart', 'joke', '90', 'minutes', 'long', '8', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'one', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'then', ""'d"", 'say', 'are', 'trouble', 'Many', 'film', 'reviewers', 'think', 'Idiocracy', '90', 'minute', 'long', 'fart', 'joke', 'then', 'probably', 'missed', 'point', 'director', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'classic', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'too', 'other', 'words', 'much', 'humor', 'indeed', 'base', 'audience', 'butt', 'pun', 'intended', 'joke.All', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'take', 'premise', 'moronic', 'future', 'literally', 'What', 'miss', 'movie', 'less', 'pathetically', 'inept', 'descendants', 'more', 'brutally', 'funny', 'look', 'media-saturated', 'corporately-controlled', 'anti-intellectual', 'out-of-shape', 'present', 'lawyer', 'future', 'recliner', 'cum', 'toilet', 'stuffing', 'face', 'artificial', 'food-goop', 'whilst', 'ogling', 'Violence', 'Channel', ""n't"", 'take', 'great', 'leap', 'imagination', 'see', 'Joe', 'Sixpack', 'vision', 'utopia', 'Advertising', 'hint', 'cerebration', 'subtlety', 'giving', 'way', 'raw', 'emotional', 'appeals', 'do', ""n't"", 'smoke', 'Tarryltons', 'f*ck', 'Welcome', 'Costco', 'love', 'Politics', 'entertainment', 'are', 'inseparable', 'pro-wrestler/porn', 'star', 'President', 'thug-filled', 'House', 'Representin', 'being', 'able', 'speak', 'articulately', 'fag', 'said', ""n't"", 'far', 'leap', 'future.Of', 'course', 'were', 'jokes', 'fell', 'flat', 'probably', 'were', 'targeted', 'trailer-trash', 'hip-hop', 'demographics', 'movie', 'sights', 'much', 'humor', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'film', 'more', 'compensates', 'emphasis', 'details', 'jokes', 'embedded', 'TV', 'screens', 'magazine', 'covers', 'billboards', 'future', 'had', 'pausing', 'DVD', 'order', 'get', 'closer', 'look', 'belly-laugh', 'catch', 'breath', 'wipe', 'tears', 'eyes', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'character', 'as', 'straight', 'can', 'only', 'situations', 'funnier.This', 'movie', 'far', 'perfect', 'will', 'definitely', 'appeal', 'who', 'suspect', ""'re"", 'living', 'idiocracy', 'right', 'now']",N/A

The poor guy went out and bought a copy and, unlike me, watched it all the way through. When I saw him next, he wanted to know what I thought was so funny. Though ""Idiocracy"" has many moments of clarity and brilliance, had I watched farther than I did, I would have understood his point.""Idiocracy"" tells the tales of Joe Bauers, played by the ever-amiable Luke Wilson -- a low ranking Air Force drudge who is more than happy to hang onto his out-of-the-way cellar desk job. Destiny intervenes in the shape of a test project to freeze ordinary humans, and next thing you know Bauers (and a hooker from downtown) end up in suspended animation for 500 years. Meanwhile, Earth's idiots have outbred the smarties and (by dint of natural selection) now run the planet. Ordinary-IQ Bauers wakes up and is suddenly, by default, the smartest man on Earth.The sight gags are pretty funny. Garbage is piled as high as skyscrapers. An actual restaurant chain with an already near-scatalogical name (rhymes with ""crud muckers"") undergoes two additional name changes to something hilariously uncouth and unprintable. Hospitals are staffed by gum-chewing idiots who painstakingly diagnose a patient's complaints using a pictorial shape board. You need to freeze this shot to appreciate the humor packed into this device alone. Language has devolved to a combination of hillbilly, valley-speak and grunts. Corporate logos are ubiquitous, and everything -- down to the clothing worn by the proles, even the judge and lawyers at court -- sports a bevy of corporate brands like NASCAR race cars. Bauers' ""intelligence"" marks him as a threat, and he is widely feared by the idiot citizenry. He runs into trouble, but ends up as advisor to the President, a foul-mouthed, black former wrestler and porn star.My boss's opinion notwithstanding, ""Idiocracy"" is brilliant and incisive, especially early on. But around the halfway mark, it gets a little too serious and the gags and insights peter out. It's here alas, that the film's magic runs out and one begins to wonder how this gaggle of morons manages to maintain the machines and computers they depend on. Add a romance and a silly chase scene, and the fun is over. But while it lasted it was a great ride. Kudos to Mike Judge for daring to name the direction of our society -- which has quickly become a celebration of the lowbrow, the irrelevant and the vulgar.My boss? I offered to buy the film from him for the $5 it cost him to buy a used copy. But he insisted that it wasn't even worth that much, and he slid it across the desk into my hands. I still don't think it's a bad film, though surely not the masterpiece that some believe it is. Cult film? Not likely.

Folks guessed Investigations, ""I don't know,"" Information ...Real stupidity is hilarious, and unexpected. Dumb people can be an unintended delight as they refilter the world around them. (Take my neighborhood, where one woman asked if my dog, a sheltie, was a ""borderline collie."")The problems with Mike Judge's Idiocracy, about the dumbing down of the United States in 500 years, are several:* Stupid people are portrayed as dull and slow, rather than what they really are: funny in ways you could never anticipate.* This movie could have been set, rather than 500 years in the future, 20 years in the past. Allan Bloom's ""The Closing of the American Mind"" came out in 1987. Fuddruckers burger joints were founded in 1980, with a name already several miles down the road toward the even ruder variant that appears in ""Idiocracy."" ""Jackass the Movie"" is more recent, 2002, and it certainly wouldn't take 500 more years to devolve into a show such as ""Idiocracy"" depicts, called ""Ow! My Balls."" Five months is more like it. Product placement, cross-positioning and sponsorships are only slightly more blatant in 2505 than than already are today.* Judge's brilliant premise and film title, that dumb people outbreed smart people, is hamstrung by  a weak script, with cliched struggles in the future, and a bit of cheap look to some of the sets. if you have a Mad Max style amphitheater battle, for Private Bowers' ""Monday night rehabilitation,"" it better not look like it cost $1.50 to stage.More humor about what's it's like to be bright in a stupid world would have enriched the script. Pvt. Bowers and Rita don't seem to be as annoyed or crafty as they might have been given their phenomenal intellectually superiority over the dummies of the future.Jokes are executed miserably. For example, a dumb, mumbling john can't get a prostitute. The portrayal of this john just looks like lousy acting. We also see more than enough borderline bigotry, as garishly dressed blacks and Hispanics are portrayed as WWF style characters in the presidency and Cabinet. I would cringe at the thought of watching ""Idiocracy"" with black friends.That said, ""Idiocracy"" may be widely remembered more for the potential movie it could have been, than for what it is. The opening sequence on breeding is fairly clever. Two high-IQ yuppies postpone children, while trailer trash breed like rabbits. Too true.

Don't let this lack of studio support prevent you from picking up this great title on DVD, however.Idiocracy is set in a futuristic world in which unintelligent people have out-bred the intelligent ones.  Army librarian Joe Bauers (Luke Wilson) was part of a hibernation experiment in 2005 that accidentally lasted 500 years, to the modern age of Idiocracy, and he awakes in a world in which is brand of average common sense is regarded as ""tardation.""  Bauers lacks the required barcode tattoo of every citizen and has an unusual amount of common sense and ability to question the status quo.  He's jailed and accused of crimes, but has the knowledge to save the planet (by watering crops with water instead of sports drinks, and so on).The genius of Idiocracy is its criticism of modern consumer culture, of branding, of Costo-like warehouses, fast food, and our addiction to Starbucks.  If this had gotten a wider release, many of the catch phrases would pervade pop culture, like those from Office Space have done.

It starts off telling us that because Americans of low IQ (the unfit) are producing infinitely more children than people with high IQ (the fit), America's future is one of general stupidity, poverty and decline. However, the solution -according to Luke Wilson's exhortation- is for people to ""read more books"" and generally pursue more intellectual activities, as if intelligence were a product of willpower and the proper stimuli. Unfortunately, science has proven that IQ is mainly an inherited, not an environmental characteristic. It is a genetic trait, and no amount of studying is going to significantly change that. Furthermore, we know that the various racial and ethnic groups have vastly differing levels of IQ. The logical conclusion from all this is that America needs to embrace some sort of eugenics program, or at the very least restrict immigration to those nations with favorable genetic intelligence traits.

The Big Lebowski made 17 million at the box office, Office Space 10.  Why?  It was way over the head the general audience, that didn't catch the subtleties, nuances and details of good comedy.  Confusion.  Others literally had to explain to them why it was funny, why it was good.  Then a DVD comes out.  Then everyone's a fan, and has been since day 1.  Then the same people that didn't get it are the same ones repeatedly [and bumblingly] quoting the movie until you just want to slap them.And so, I am honored to be the first one to stand up and say Idiocracy is absolute, pure genius!  The satire is brilliant and biting, the comedy blunt on the surface (yet oh so relevant) and perfectly delivered by skilled actors.  It's rated 3 now (""stupid funny""?... wrong).  But mark this review, someday Idiocracy will be rated 4.5 with hundreds of glowing reviews (see above).Idiocracy is about excess; total instant gratification, consumerism, crudity and ... decline on an grand scale: hand jobs with latte, slot machines at the hospital, tissue style dispensers of advertisement slathered ""Pro Wear"", CostCos the size of cities, 5 time Smackdown champion President, and so on.Idiocracy is about erosion.  The slide and decline of all the things that make (made?) humanity great.  Morality, hard work, standards, art, civility, creativity...  everything.  It's about shutting off your brain and doing what feels good and ignoring art for the sake of ""entertainment"".  It's about being wasteful, rude, lazy, stupid, crass... and being obliviously happy out it!The details, details, details contained within Idiocracy!  I love sci-fi and Mike Judge's Idiocracy is without a doubt the funniest sci-fi ever.  There are so many details of this terrible future in the movie; you would have to watch it a dozen times to catch all of the clever stabs.  I could edit this review for years adding new observations.  I won't, but do yourself a favor and enjoy searching for and scrutinizing them.The advertising in Idiocracy is hilarious.  It is everywhere.  Everywhere.  To me, it's not so much a critique about the ethics of advertising and marketing as it is an attack that they work so well on so many!  Why is it so damn ubiquitously pervasive and increasingly insistent and invasive?  Because some one out there is falling for it...  ""Welcome to COSTCO...  I love you.""  This is why greeters are there!  Yet it obviously is making some of us think that these corporations actually do care. Proclaiming love seems a logical end result. Idiocracy is about a populace totally enslaved by marketing. ""It's got electrolytes!""Some are branding Idiocracy as an anti-capitalistic diatribe against ""red state"" culture and using it elevate themselves in all their smug, elitist glory.  While Idiocracy is a hilarious critique of monolithic corporations, to claim that is its thesis is both false and missing the point.  It's so much more...

This movie spares no one, least of all American 'culture.'  It doesn't make the point that an intellectual aristocracy should run the world and reproduce to the exclusion of people with low IQs or low socio-economic origins.  To think so would be to misunderstand.As the movie points out towards the end, people should just use their minds for thinking rather than for the aquisition of constant immediate gratification the likes of which make up the entirety of the future reality the film depicts.Intelligence is endangered by consumerism and an overindulgence in entertainment that is quickly coming to represent the source of our American 'culture' and its smarts in its entirety (so long as we're comfortable and happy right?); by people's almost religious belief in advertising as representative of actually knowledge; and by a lack of ambition except when toe to toe with our own extinction.This is a heady movie that manages to deliver a message in an entertaining and even hillarious way.  It might not appeal to those who just want to laugh--the movie sort of laughs at them in fact--but at the same time it's not inaccessible to people who read books and see films merely as bubble gum for the brain.Hopefully, more 'get it' than feel they've paid to be insulted.I'm going to buy it so I can lend it out.",5,"The movie that laughs with you, not at you--unless you're an idiot!

Judge's little-known ""Idiocracy"" is something of an enigma: short (85 min) and to the point, but after watching it, you're left feeling you might've missed something, as if Judge must've had some hidden message in mind.  And that might be the problem some people have with the film.  Fact is, you didn't miss anything.The movie is simplistic, yet shockingly direct in it's premise, which is layed out in the first 5 minutes as directly as possible: through naration.  From there, it's an all-out critique on dumbed-down society and over the top marketing.  The greatness of the movie is not in its complex message or theme, but rather in how closely the future mirrors the present state of America.  The number one show in the future (""Ow My Balls!"") is a parody of some of the dumber shows popular today (e.g. ""Jackass""), and the marketing of some products (""The Thirst Mutilator"" and such) poke fun at some of the ""extreme"" products out today, or those with a bunch of ingrediants that few even know what they do (""it's got electrolytes!""). And the Starbucks and Walmarts of the future get the worst of it.So all in all, a great comedy with an interesting premise.  I was going to give it 4 stars, but after researching the movie to discover why I'd never heard of it in the theaters, I gave it a bonus star.  Seems Fox found the movie too edgy / insulting to people (and sponsers!), so they did absolutely no promoting of the movie and released it in only around 10 movies in the whole US - the reason the first time you may come across this is in a Blockbuster.

Its message stays with you.  500 years into the future, today's average Joe will be the smartest man in the world because the human race will devolve.

1031933,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B000K7VHOG,K. Driscoll,"[214, 218]","Idiocracy, meaning rule of the stupid, is a dystopian film from Director Mike Judge (Office Space) that cost about $30 million to make but only made about half a million dollars because the film's distributor wanted nothing to do with promoting the film.  There were no advertisements, no trailers, and the film was eventually released on just 130 screens in a limited amount of American cities.  The film is written by successful veterans, stars some solid talent, and the CGI effects and art direction were likely not inexpensive.  Unlike most films that a distributor ignores, Idiocracy was well-received by critics and I will echo here that it is indeed a very good satire.  The distributor was of course Fox and they were likely embarrassed to release a film that does what any good dystopian tale does, and that is strongly denounce the self-destructive culture we currently live in and continue to facilitate.Joe Bauers (Luke Wilson) is the military's most average soldier.  He is literally tested to be of average intelligence, health, etc.  Rita (Maya Rudolph) is a prostitute who is seemingly always fearful of her pimp Upgraydd.  They are both selected as guinea pigs for a classified program that aims to place them in hibernation for one year.  They are put into coffin-like chambers and forgotten about after the program dissolves.  They are left there for 500 years until they awaken after their chambers are forced open by the great garbage avalanche of 2505.  The setting they exist in is a low-intelligence society influenced by dysgenics, cultural and moral devolution, and powerful corporate influence and consumerism.  Starbucks and Costco have basically become brothels.  Crops are fed with Gatorade because of, you know, the electrolytes.  Doctors diagnose people as ""tarded"".  The president is an alpha-male nationalist and former professional wrestler/porn star. A museum shows that Charlie Chaplin was leader of the Nazi party who fought using dinosaurs in their army but was eventually ""Un-Nazied"" by the ""Un"" (the United Nations).  There are some more vulgar and hilarious ways in which corporations evolve to satisfy the ever decreasing intelligence of our society that I'd like to mention but can't.  Finally, average soldier Joe Bauer is tested to be the most intelligent human being on Earth in 2505 and the rest of the story centers on his development in this environment.  There are also some really interesting supporting roles from Thomas Haden Church and Justin Long, among others.There are a few production flaws and at times some clunky dialogue, but really those are just nitpickings.  Idiocracy is at times absolutely hilarious and it manages to make its point throughout.  I think with many dystopian films people get offended by the societal criticism.  However, I was encouraged by the truth within the satire here and enjoyed the film tremendously.

It's the tale of an average joe/military librarian named Joe (Luke Wilson)who, along with a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph), takes part in a hibernation experiment for the military.  Instead of awaking one year later, however, they wake up five hundred years in the future.  The really bad thing is that thanks to the commercialization of society and the fact that smart people don't breed as fast as those who are less than perfect, the future that Joe and Rita wake up in is terribly......well, dumb.  The film explores how a life dependent on the media and heavy promotion reduces the average person into an electrolyte drinking, TV watching, lazy fool.When he registers the highest score ever on an aptitude test, Joe is thrust into the political arena by President Camacho (Terry Crews).  Camacho hopes that with Joe's brainpower, he can regain his popularity as president of the United States.  Crops have dried up and people are beginning to starve.  The future is very, very bleak, and all thanks to the boobtube and those talking heads on the five o'clock news.Overall, the story is just too boring to really send the point of the film home.  Wilson is game in all of his averageness, but he really doesn't have much to work with.  Maya Rudolph does everything she can with Rita, and gives one of the better performances in the show.  Justin Long, Thomas Haden Church, and an uncredited Sara Rue give the best performances in the film overall, even if they only get a few seconds of screen time.I agree with Judge that the world is headed for an idiocracy, but he misfired with this film.  It's not intelligently funny or even idiotically funny.  In fact, it mirrors the world Judge says will eventually be our downfall.  It's loud, annoying and silly without being all that fun to watch.  Heck, it even has Dax Shepard in it, who along with Ashton Kutcher, has done his part to contribute to the downfall of mankind via ""Punk'd.""I was let down by this movie.

As a result, it is now survival of the most reproductive.  Since smart people wait and debate before they mate, and since stupid people (according to this film) have as much sex and babies as jack rabbits, well, the future of the world ain't lookin' so good.  Er, isn't.  Isn't looking so good.Average Joe (Luke Wilson) is put in a top secret hibernation experiment that goes awry; he wakes up 500 years later (instead of one) to find that America is now ruled and populated by morons.  In fact, tests reveal that he is currently the smartest person alive.  He is accompanied by fellow hibernator Rita (an underplayed, oddly restrained Maya Rudolph) and a dumb-as-driftwood Frito (Dax Shepard).I didn't laugh at all when I watched ""Idiocracy,"" but I did smile, and I did find parts of it funny (the poorly planned sign for the Saint God hospital; buildings lashed together; the cameos by Stephen Root and Justin Long).  I suppose I knew, even after the spot-on opening sequence, that I wasn't in for much.  After all, the premise milks itself dry in a matter of minutes.  There is only so much you can do when 99% of your characters are, literally, complete morons.Luke tries his best with his straight-man role (an identity he assumes well), but he is surrounded by actors and actresses who aren't being asked to exercise their chops.  After all, playing dumb is pretty easy.  The script doesn't call for much insight (or hope), either; Mike Judge doesn't really have a message so much as he has a warning, and it's not a warning even he's taking all that seriously.  He doesn't need to, after all.  It doesn't take 90 seconds, let alone 90 minutes to get his point.That point having been made in the first fifteen minutes, ""Idiocracy"" spends the rest of its time trying to get some mileage out of jokes that are, necessarily, stupid.  Most of what's really funny in this flick are the half-second pause-or-you'll-miss-em visual gags, like road signs, various places of business, or characters in the background.  The special effects budget for the film wasn't very hefty, but they've made do as well as they need to, and, again, some grins are to be had at the new ""style"" of architecture, and the fact that (surprise, surprise) everything from sex to prison guards is affixed with corporate logos.It's all marginally witty stuff, but also incredibly silly, and in that sense, the movie both succeeds and fails.  It's a one-note gag stretched out into an entire musical.  I think it's just too bad that Judge didn't feel like putting more brains into the film.

Its release was delayed for years, the effects budget was cut drastically, it was never screened for critics and when it WAS released, it opened in a grand total of 130 theaters nationwide, and yanked very quickly after that.There's enough discussion of the plot here, so I'll skip that. It owes an obvious debt to Kornbluth's ""The Marching Morons"", and that, too, is enough reason to see it. It is definitely one of the most bitter, cynical, and bleak movies I can recall viewing, and it has far more depth than a superficial look would convey. (I found myself hitting the ""pause"" button frequently - there's a LOT of details to check out.) The anti-corporate slams are fast and furious, and the scene of people playing the slots hoping for medical care is priceless. Those who complain that ""it's dumb"" obviously just don't get the point. (Maybe it's too much Fox News?)Unfortunately, it loses energy in the second half with the contrived ""romance"". And in spite of what the case says, it is full-screen only. (The case claims it's widescreen, and double-sided.)  It could have used some better effects and post-production work, but the studio wouldn't have it. A commentary would have really been welcome, too.

The old joke goes like this... Q: what do rich people do instead of having sex? A: rule the world. In ""Idiocracy"", Judge has turned the old joke around 180 degrees.Experience, as always, is the best teacher, and ""Idiocracy"" unflatteringly depicts the sort of rabid homophobia and coeval anti-intellectualism which were present in our public high schools during the early '80s, when the ""proud to be stupid"" movement was in its infancy.

Like we laughed at Ted Knight in Caddyshack or at Bill Lumburg in Office Space, or at all the pepole on the Jerry Springer show.  But this film makes you feel uneasy, precisely because it brilliantly forces you to recognize how YOU are part of the problem.  So you aren't going to find it funny if you can't laugh at yourself.It's supposed to be about sort of reverse eugenics, with the dumb pepole outbreeding the smart people, so much of the audience came in thinking of themselves as the latter and looking forward to making fun of the Jerry Springer set.  Marketing and the deterioration of our popular culture are what this film is really about though.I'll cite just one example.  At one point Frito and the gang are fleeing from the police, when their car is disabled by remote control and stops.  Before they get half a block the police have zeroed in on the car and start spraying it methodically with gunfire.  Pedestrians passing by slow down to observe the automatic weapon-fire, and begin to get excited.  Irrationally, Frito pauses as well, and starts to backtrack.  The crowd begins to leap up and down and push and shove each other.  Frito is drooling in excitement over the destruction of his own car, as his friends pull him away...The disturbing thing is, I was drawn into the car being shot up as well, as an audience member.

Highly educated, high income, highly intelligent people are too busy earning degrees and building careers to have children. Meanwhile, everyone with reproductive organs and an IQ one standard deviation below average is reproducing and reproducing and reproducing some more. What happens to the world when the least intelligent fill the planet with their equally dim-witted offspring? Now if that seems like a politically incorrect idea, look around. It's happening all over the place.So what happens to America when the least productive become the most reproductive. Luke Wilson plays Joe Bauersan an Army corporal who (based on his absolute averageness) is chosen for an experiment in cryogenics. Get it he's Joe average. But a series of mishaps results in him being revived 500 years later than scheduled. He awakens in an America where trash is piled miles high in everyone's yard because nobody knows what to do with it, nothing works because nobody knows how to repair it, and everyone is dumb as an average MMA fan. Lawyers brag that they got their legal education at Costco (an institution of higher education almost as prestigious as the University of Pheonix) and patrons go to Starbucks for happy ending massages. In a world of morons, this average Joe is now the smartest guy in the country, and expected to fix all the problems. For instance, the world is running out of food because the cognitively disfunctional people are watering the crops with Gatorade. But when Joe tells them to stop watering their crops with Gatorade, a bunch of Gatorade employees lose their jobs and Joe becomes the most hated man in the country.Idicracy is one part Atlas Shrugged, one part Beevis and Butthead, and one part Margaret Sanger's worst nightmare. The humor of this movie is deliberately low-brow, not just for laughs but because it helps make the filmakers point. After all, what would America be like if everything was dumbed down to the lowest common denominator and smart people began dissapearing? Well hang on because it's happening right now.

1031976,A1FG91CM8221X1,B000K7VHOG,Miles D. Moore,"[8, 9]","Comparing Mike Judge's ""Idiocracy"" with Alfonso Cuaron's ""Children of Men"" in some ways is like comparing ""The Killing Fields"" with ""Dumb and Dumber."" Yet, underneath all the silly sex and potty humor, Judge's vision of the future is as despairing as Cuaron's. Whereas ""Children of Men"" postulates a future endangered by the lack of fertility, ""Idiocracy"" presents a dystopia created by a surfeit of fertility. In a world where humankind has no natural predators, the deliberately pompous narrator tells us, survival belongs not to the fittest, but to those who reproduce the most. Therefore, Judge--the creator of Beavis and Butt-head--presents the year 2505 as a time in which Beavises and Butt-heads crowd the streets, perform surgery, adjudicate the courts, run major corporations and occupy the White House. Into this world Judge thrusts Joe (Luke Wilson) and Rita (Maya Rudolph), two painfully average victims of a 2005 suspended animation experiment gone awry, who find themselves by far the smartest people in the world. The frightened, angry populace gives them a choice: find solutions to the skyscraper-sized mounds of garbage and dust-bowl farming conditions that afflict the society, or else face ""Monday Night Rehabilitation,"" which is much better seen than described. ""Idiocracy"" is far from a refined cinematic experience, and it's also far from perfect (Judge should have ditched the obtrusive narration after the prologue).

The very premise was something I could laugh about as I've seen it happen in practice.We are introduced to the world while they explore population growth.  Most noticeably is the fact that less intelligent people are procreating far greater than those with higher IQ's.  The family tree keeps piling up squashing the scientists, doctors, and others until we fear for the future.  Then we are introduced to Joe.  Joe Bauers (Luke Wilson) is an average guy about to be used for a scientific experiment.  He and Rita (Maya Rudolph), a woman donated by her pimp are going to be put in a freeze and supposedly only a year will go by before they are awakened.  Something goes horribly awry however.Joe awakens to the year 2505 and right away knows something is wrong.  At first he's not sure what year it is but stumbles around through people watching whole movies just showing someone's hind end, wearing enough advertisements on their clothing to blind someone, and not being able to understand him due to his ""pretentious"" way of speaking.  When he doesn't have the means to pay his hospital bill he's quickly shipped off to prison where after a IQ test and a tattoo being created on his arm, he daringly escapes.  With the help of his lawyer Frito (Dax Shepard) he sets off to find Rita and a time machine and get out, but before he can, he is recaptured and sent to work for the President as he is the smartest man in the world.  For him to escape, he has to solve the world's problems.They did an ok job at casting the characters.  While they all did their best with a very strange dialogue and script, some of it felt stilted.  Dax Shepard as Frito was good, but at times his character was actually boring, despite its idiocy.  Luke Wilson as the one sane voice was strange just because I'm so accostomed to him playing roles where his character is a little slow.  I did like Rita.  She was sassy and played the role quite well.Since this is a dystopian future where everyone is an idiot there is a lot of terrible humour in the movie.  Fart jokes abound and sex is a very big theme.  This would be pretty funny usually except that this same ""joke"" is constantly repeated throughout the entire film. It got to be that some of the jokes were boring at times. It would have been nice for them to add some other elements relating to the stupidity within the film as well, such as how people are caring for children without killing them off or how the big factories are running with such a low grade of personnel.  They did throw in how big companies had taken over but I didn't understand that somehow as its difficult to run a big company and I just didn't see these people managing to maintain such an enterprise.The total plot was well done but the pacing of the film wasn't the greatest.  They spent too much time on certain areas of the film and I could find myself getting tired of some of the scenes. They did do a good job of getting the message across though and these elements of stupidity becoming prevalent were high priority in the film.Overall I did like the movie and found it tremendously funny.  I just wish they had taken it a little further.Review by M.

Idiocracy stars Luke Wilson as Joe Bauers, an army private who is the definition of ""average"" in terms of intelligence and nearly everything else.  He is picked, along with a prostitute named Rita (Saturday Night Live vet Maya Rudolph) for a top secret hibernation experiment where they will be asleep for a year.  Instead, the experiment becomes forgotten about, and both wake up 500 years in the future where the world has become overpopulated, overpolluted, and above all, incredibly stupid.  While Judge's satire on American society and culture is far from subtle, Idiocracy's message is what really makes it worthwhile.  This message, laced within visual gags and some truly hilarious moments, is one that should not be missed, and Idiocracy is a film that should not be missed either, even if Fox went out of their way to not promote the film.  The rest of the cast, which includes Dax Shepard, Terry Crews (as the president no less), and Office Space's David Herman, are incredibly fitting as well in their roles.

Probably not, but it will garner a cult following on DVD after its unfortunate now you see it now you don't run in theatres.  I was lucky enough to be in one of the few cities that played this in theatres and found the film to be quite funny.  Mike Judge's satires is all the more poignant as it arrives in a time where a president's intelligence has come into question time and time again and television is ruled by inane reality programming.Idiocracy tells the story of Pvt. Joe Bowers who is quite literally an average Joe.  For this reason, the army selects him to be frozen in time as part of an experiment.  It goes awry when he awakes 500 years in the future as opposed to one year.  He finds a future where it seems only the stupid people are producing offspring, where commercial culture has found its way into everything from education to the naming of children and people drink a gatorade like sports drink instead of water.  For this reason, Joe is now the smartest man in the world and might hold the key to this society's future.Judge's satire succeeds because it is unrelenting and unapologetic.  It's amazing that some of the products named in this movie didn't sue, as Judge shows a city sized Costco where you can get a law degree or a Carls, Jr. whose future slogan is a profane spin on ""Don't Bother Me, I'm Eating.""  The plot involves the people of the future looking to Joe for guidance to save their world.  The story is kind of sloppy, but that's okay.  Much like Judge's own Office Space, it merely serves as a backdrop for Judge's satire to play out.  It's the films keen observations on where were headed that make this film so funny and rightly timed.Perhaps we'll never understand why this DVD will be the first opportunity for many to see this funny film.  Maybe it's satire is a little too unrelenting.  Looking at many of the movies that come out and rise to number one, Judge may be right about where we're headed.

Martel""","[4, 5]","Mike Judge has created some great comedic work in the past, especially his previous film Office Space, and his television series, King of the Hill.  With that track record I had high hopes for the film.  Judge takes the basic concept from the Woody Allen film, Sleeper.  However, his vision of the nightmare future shows us a nation plagued by laziness, selfishness, and completely immersed in commercialism.Is it exaggerated?  Yes.  Is it over the top?  Yes.  Is it funny?  Yes it is.  The interesting thing is that this film can work on two levels.  On the surface the movie is dumb.  It wants you to laugh at stupid people doing stupid things.  Some will find the concept of a show where a man gets hit in the crotch every five seconds just as hilarious as the denizens of this demented future do.  Others will find such a concept juvenile.The real comedy of the film comes when you dig a bit deeper.  I think Judge is pointing at this possible future and asking us to look at our present.  Why does everything need a sponsor?  When did thinking become annoying?  Just because it's easy, does it make it better?  Pretty weighty questions from the guy who brought us Beevis and Butthead.  Like I said, most of that is buried in the film.  The surface is much more stupid.  You can enjoy the film either way.Judge assembled a solid cast.  Luke Wilson plays Joe like a regular guy lost in a moronic world (haven't we all had that experience at one time or another in our lives).  Maya Rudolph as Rita also does a good job as a working girl just trying to survive in this stupid state society.  Dax Shepard plays the ultra-dense Frito with gusto.  The rest of the supporting cast does a good job with the roles and making you laugh and pray to God that this is not our unfortunate future.The script is a great mixture of obvious and stupid jokes, with pointed and sharp satire.  Somethings get a little too obvious at points, but for the most part the lines are funny and the situation (while a little generic at times) is entertaining.My only complaints about the movie are some of the weaker effects work (doesn't look like Fox helped out Mike Judge with an appropriate budget) and some lack of subtly.The disc itself has a clear picture, good sound but weak extras.  A few deleted scenes is all we get.  I would have loved to hear Mike Judge commentary.  I've heard that the movie has a sordid history.  I'm sure Fox didn't want Judge spilling the beans on that aspect of the film.  Oh well.I think Idiocracy is a cult classic in the making.  It's funny, disturbing, and has some great moments in it.

I'm a 50-year-old woman and professional writer. I'm blessed to have many, many smart friends who are college professors and doctors and lawyers and fellow writers. I've observed that the really smart, educated people are not reproducing. Most of my highly intelligent friends have purposefully made a decision to not have children.Meanwhile, I also have connections to people who live in poverty down in the south. Despite the fact that they have no money and no education and no teeth, they're breeding like bunnies. And just as ""Idiocracy"" portrays, these folks are not pair-bonding for life. Sally Joe has six kids but those most of those six kids were fathered by different men, and those men fathered several other children by several other women.I fear that if we don't start demanding that parents take full financial, moral and emotional responsibility for their offspring, that our future will look like that portrayed by Idiocracy. You can see some of that already. I'm an architectural historian and try finding a skilled craftsman who knows how to replicate early 20th Century craftsmanship.

Nelson,"[0, 7]","Some years ago one of the newsmagazines, probably Time, did an article on the fallout of wealthy, intelligent couples having few or no children while the underclass exploded.  This movie essentially takes this idea up and expands it to its most ridiculous conclusion.Our hero Joe and a whore named Rita are accidentally kept in hibernation for 500 years, in an experiment that was only to last one year.  They awaken to an America dominated by dunces, the prolific offspring of clods who eventually overwhelmed the uptight, nearly childless intellectuals.  The premise makes for an intriguing politically incorrect situation, but largely fails to pan out on screen.It's not just the gross-out humor and nonstop obscenities that mar the movie; there are large gaps of logic as well.  If the future people are so stupid, who's maintaining the Orwellian surveillance equipment that abounds, not to mention the vast machinery of the ""Rehabilitation"" arena?  Mike Judge is also very careful in his portrayal of fast-breeding doofuses, and with good reason.  To avoid charges of racism he ensures that they are almost entirely red-neck good ol' boy types.  It simply doesn't ring true.Still, the movie provides a number of chuckles and a supersized dose of smugness.  Who won't feel superior to the imbeciles portrayed on the screen?  This is only a two star movie, but I give it an extra star for being as bold as it is, given the current politically correct climate.",3,You Say You Want a Devolution...,1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,1462,"['years', 'one', 'newsmagazines', 'probably', 'Time', 'did', 'article', 'fallout', 'wealthy', 'intelligent', 'couples', 'having', 'few', 'children', 'underclass', 'exploded', 'movie', 'essentially', 'idea', 'up', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'conclusion.Our', 'hero', 'Joe', 'whore', 'named', 'Rita', 'are', 'accidentally', 'kept', 'hibernation', '500', 'years', 'experiment', 'was', 'only', 'last', 'one', 'year', 'awaken', 'America', 'dominated', 'dunces', 'prolific', 'offspring', 'clods', 'who', 'eventually', 'overwhelmed', 'uptight', 'nearly', 'childless', 'intellectuals', 'premise', 'intriguing', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'situation', 'largely', 'pan', 'out', 'screen.It', 'not', 'just', 'gross-out', 'humor', 'nonstop', 'obscenities', 'mar', 'movie', 'are', 'large', 'gaps', 'logic', 'well', 'future', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'stupid', 'who', 'maintaining', 'Orwellian', 'surveillance', 'equipment', 'not', 'mention', 'vast', 'machinery', 'Rehabilitation', 'arena', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'also', 'very', 'careful', 'portrayal', 'fast-breeding', 'doofuses', 'good', 'reason', 'avoid', 'charges', 'racism', 'are', 'almost', 'entirely', 'red-neck', 'good', 'ol', 'boy', 'types', 'simply', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true.Still', 'movie', 'number', 'chuckles', 'supersized', 'dose', 'smugness', 'Who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'superior', 'imbeciles', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'only', 'two', 'star', 'movie', 'give', 'extra', 'star', 'being', 'as', 'bold', 'given', 'current', 'politically', 'correct', 'climate']",N/A

1032028,A3PM1QNZ1O8EXF,B000K7VHOG,"..R.. ""..R..""","[2, 2]","I didn't even know this movie existed up until 2 weeks ago. I never read or heard anything on it. The movie has warped into a Cult Classic for me, after watching it for the first time. So far I have had the movie on my DVR for over 2 weeks now, and I have only deleted it now because I bought the DVD. Normally I watch a movie once and then I'm good for years, but not Idiocracy. I have now seen this movie 10 times! To think I almost didn't watch it. I had confused Luke Wilson, with Owen Wilson. Owen is great at doing comedies, but this movie needs a Straight-Lace personality to pull it off and Luke does that perfectly.(Basic Plot)Luke Wilson, AKA Joe Bauers, is an average man in every possible way. Basic IQ, basic health, just basic; which makes him perfect for an experiment in Cryogenics. The Army also finds Maya Rudolph, AKA Rita to participate. As long as her pimp gets paid. This ""Getting His Money"" theme plays throughout the movie (I will get to this later). The experiment goes horribly wrong and they are both forgotten about for 500 years. They are awakened in a time where the Status Quo has dropped to the point where humans are on the verge of starvation. It seems that more idiots have spawned children then intelligent people, creating an inbred Society of morons. Which in reality is a true concept; as mean as that sounds. So this general idea adds a type of realism to the movie. Human Speech is no longer what we would consider formal. It is a mix of Ebonics, Valley Girl, ect. Much in the way that our ancestors would view how we pronounce words today, as being crude; the Idiocracy future is even worse. Joe Bauers is able to understand them, but they view him as being a ""Fag."" This Broken-English is already on it's way to becoming the norm, so I love the idea that Mike Judge added this to his movie. What makes the movie so funny is the little details. When Joe first meets up with Dax Shepard, AKA Frito, Dax is watching a show called ""Ow! My Balls!"" on a Giant-Screen TV. But the only part of the screen where you can view the show is in the very middle. The rest of the surrounding screen is full of flashing, blinking advertisements. These annoying banners, which cover up 80% of the screen, are the predictable future to a practice that didn't exist back in the 90's, but are now EVERYWHERE in our own time! So in Idiocracy future, your 7 Foot TV screen, will really only end up being 20 Inches after Advertisers fill the rest of the space with banners.Water is no longer consumed; instead it is now a Gatorade-Type drink called Brawndo that is the most consumed beverage. This again comes from present culture where a person would rather drink sugar-water then just plain-old water. Waves and claps of respect have been replaced with the Middle Finger. Swear words are also part of everyday Society and are not viewed as insults. Food has been replaced with Junk Food. There is no longer 4-Star restaurants, just Fast-Food and Microwavable snacks. The marquee restaurant is called Butt-F***ers ( Fuddruckers to us). These eating habits have caused people to look Doughy (Soft and Fat).clothing has also had to change with the times. Suits and slacks have been replaced with T-Shirts and Nylon pants, covered with advertisements. Basically, if you woke up in the Idiocracy future, you wouldn't be shocked. It is everything that takes place now, just after 500 years of progression.Both Joe and Rita find themselves the smartest people alive. Joe is tasked with saving the world and Rita ends up trying to save Joe from those who he is trying to help. Maya Rudolph really plays her character well. Which must be pretty easy for her seeing as she has been on SNL for years and years. I couldn't stop laughing at her repeated worries that her former pimp would travel through time to get his money. It's just the simple things like this that make you want to watch the movie over and over again. Every time I watch it I find a new joke hidden in the background. Luke is funny because he isn't trying to be funny. That is why I didn't want to see the movie if Owen Wilson was the star. I know what to expect from Owen, but Luke isn't known for comedies.I don't want to give away everything. If you see the DVD for rent or sale, get it. Fox Movies didn't want to show Idiocracy in the theaters, so that is why you, like me, most likely didn't hear anything about it. But like Orgazmo, Idiocracy is a hidden gem. A movie that pushes boarders just enough to keep it edgy, but not enough to warrant a boycott.",5,A Real Look Into mankind's Future!,1210204800,"05 8, 2008",2008,4540,"['did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'movie', 'existed', 'up', '2', 'weeks', 'ago', 'never', 'read', 'heard', 'anything', 'movie', 'warped', 'Cult', 'Classic', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'So', 'far', 'have', 'had', 'movie', 'DVR', '2', 'weeks', 'now', 'have', 'only', 'deleted', 'now', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Normally', 'watch', 'movie', 'once', 'then', ""'m"", 'good', 'years', 'not', 'Idiocracy', 'have', 'now', 'seen', 'movie', '10', 'times', 'think', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'had', 'confused', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Owen', 'great', 'doing', 'comedies', 'movie', 'Straight-Lace', 'personality', 'pull', 'off', 'Luke', 'perfectly', 'Basic', 'Plot', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'AKA', 'Joe', 'Bauers', 'average', 'man', 'possible', 'way', 'Basic', 'IQ', 'basic', 'health', 'just', 'basic', 'perfect', 'experiment', 'Cryogenics', 'Army', 'also', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'AKA', 'Rita', 'participate', 'As', 'long', 'pimp', 'paid', 'Getting', 'Money', 'theme', 'movie', 'will', 'get', 'later', 'experiment', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'are', 'forgotten', '500', 'years', 'are', 'awakened', 'time', 'where', 'Status', 'Quo', 'dropped', 'point', 'where', 'humans', 'are', 'verge', 'starvation', 'more', 'idiots', 'have', 'spawned', 'children', 'then', 'intelligent', 'people', 'creating', 'inbred', 'Society', 'morons', 'Which', 'reality', 'true', 'concept', 'as', 'mean', 'So', 'general', 'idea', 'type', 'realism', 'movie', 'Human', 'Speech', 'no', 'longer', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'formal', 'mix', 'Ebonics', 'Valley', 'Girl', 'ect', 'Much', 'way', 'ancestors', 'would', 'view', 'how', 'pronounce', 'words', 'today', 'being', 'crude', 'Idiocracy', 'future', 'even', 'worse', 'Joe', 'Bauers', 'able', 'understand', 'view', 'being', 'Fag', 'Broken-English', 'already', 'way', 'becoming', 'norm', 'love', 'idea', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'added', 'movie', 'What', 'movie', 'so', 'funny', 'little', 'details', 'When', 'Joe', 'first', 'up', 'Dax', 'Shepard', 'AKA', 'Frito', 'Dax', 'watching', 'show', 'called', 'Ow', 'Balls', 'Giant-Screen', 'TV', 'only', 'part', 'screen', 'where', 'can', 'view', 'show', 'very', 'middle', 'rest', 'surrounding', 'screen', 'full', 'flashing', 'blinking', 'advertisements', 'annoying', 'banners', 'cover', 'up', '80', '%', 'screen', 'are', 'predictable', 'future', 'practice', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'back', '90', 'are', 'now', 'EVERYWHERE', 'own', 'time', 'So', 'Idiocracy', 'future', '7', 'Foot', 'TV', 'screen', 'will', 'really', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'being', '20', 'Inches', 'Advertisers', 'fill', 'rest', 'space', 'banners.Water', 'no', 'longer', 'consumed', 'instead', 'now', 'Gatorade-Type', 'drink', 'called', 'Brawndo', 'most', 'consumed', 'beverage', 'again', 'present', 'culture', 'where', 'person', 'would', 'rather', 'drink', 'sugar-water', 'then', 'just', 'plain-old', 'water', 'Waves', 'claps', 'respect', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'Middle', 'Finger', 'Swear', 'words', 'are', 'also', 'part', 'everyday', 'Society', 'are', 'not', 'viewed', 'insults', 'Food', 'been', 'replaced', 'Junk', 'Food', 'longer', '4-Star', 'restaurants', 'just', 'Fast-Food', 'Microwavable', 'snacks', 'marquee', 'restaurant', 'called', 'Butt-F***ers', 'Fuddruckers', 'eating', 'habits', 'have', 'caused', 'people', 'look', 'Doughy', 'Soft', 'Fat', '.clothing', 'also', 'had', 'change', 'times', 'Suits', 'slacks', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'T-Shirts', 'Nylon', 'pants', 'covered', 'advertisements', 'Basically', 'woke', 'up', 'Idiocracy', 'future', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'shocked', 'everything', 'place', 'now', 'just', '500', 'years', 'progression.Both', 'Joe', 'Rita', 'find', 'smartest', 'people', 'alive', 'Joe', 'tasked', 'saving', 'world', 'Rita', 'up', 'trying', 'save', 'Joe', 'who', 'trying', 'help', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'really', 'character', 'well', 'Which', 'must', 'be', 'pretty', 'easy', 'seeing', 'been', 'SNL', 'years', 'years', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'repeated', 'worries', 'former', 'pimp', 'would', 'travel', 'time', 'get', 'money', 'just', 'simple', 'things', 'make', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'over', 'again', 'Every', 'time', 'watch', 'find', 'new', 'joke', 'hidden', 'background', 'Luke', 'funny', ""n't"", 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'was', 'star', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Owen', 'Luke', ""n't"", 'known', 'comedies.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'everything', 'see', 'DVD', 'rent', 'sale', 'get', 'Fox', 'Movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'show', 'Idiocracy', 'theaters', 'why', 'most', 'likely', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'anything', 'Orgazmo', 'Idiocracy', 'hidden', 'gem', 'movie', 'boarders', 'just', 'enough', 'keep', 'edgy', 'not', 'enough', 'warrant', 'boycott']",N/A

The plot of the movie is pretty ingenious as Judge notices that dumber people are breeding at a higher rate while the smarter people tend to wait, sometimes to the point that it ends up being too late. At this rate, Judge theorizes that this will lead to the dumbing down of America that will make the Paris Hilton-obsessed of today look like Rhodes Scholars in comparison.The story starts off in present day with your average Joe, quite literally as his name is Joe and he is completely average in every way, in Luke Wilson (Legally Blonde) picked for his averageness for a military experiment to see if they can keep soldiers alive for future wars. Since they didn't have a comparable female in the army, the military pays a pimp Upgrayedd (played by Scareface whose Damn it Feels Good to be a Gangsta was hilariously used in Office Space) to offer up one of his ladies in Maya Rudolph (Saturday Night Live).Naturally the experiment goes bad when the main guy behind it ends up in jail leaving no one to know about it. And it is not until the Great Garbage Avalanche of 2505 until they are jarred loose from their sleeping chambers into a world that is run by corporations, the Congress is now sponsored by Pepsi and the Secretary of Defense mentions Carl's Jr. in every sentence because he gets a fee for it.It is because of the anti-corporate message that you probably have never heard of Idiocracy as the movie was released by 20th Century Fox, whose parent company News Corp is one of the worst offenders of greed trumps morals philosophy. Judge may not have helped things when he depicted Fox News anchormen of the future on air wardrobe as no shirts for the guys and bikinis for the woman. Nonetheless the braintrust at Fox with their hurt feelings decided to only give the film a limited release, no trailer, no ads, no press kits, and the film wasn't even screened for critics to review.The morons of the future, in true Judge style, are what makes the movie. Dax Shepard (Let's Go to Prison) is Joe's inept lawyer and the one who tries to help him to the Time Machine that could get him and Rudolph back to present day.

I was never a big fan of his animated stuff, but so far his live action track record is superb.  The concept is quite simple.  The military calls on Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph to test out their hibernation project due to their extreme average-ness.  They were only meant to be suspended in time for one year, but after the project gets shut down they find themselves waking up 500 years later, where idiots rule the world due to de-evolution as a result of years and years of hillbillies incestuously breeding.  Wilson's ""average Joe"" character has now become the smartest man in the world by default.The world has become overrun with mass consumerism and popular franchises turned into whore houses.  Our cultural obsessions with sex and violence has reached an all time high.  A Gatorade-type energy drink has replaced water entirely.  The President of the United States is an ex-wrestler porn star.  It's the downfall of society in every way imaginable.Idiocracy had so many jokes packed into it that I had to rewind it a few times to catch what I missed in the background.  There's so many visual gags in every location that I'm sure the art department had fun creating this idiot proof world.  The laughs per minute factor was very high as they just keep throwing joke after joke at you.  Some of them miss but the majority of them hit for me.Wilson plays the perfect straight man in an outrageous setting.  It was important to his character that they make him seem smart compared to his surroundings, but not too smart, and it's easy to put yourself in his place as he's one of the only characters that can form a complete sentence.  He still has his shortcomings but he's the perfect protagonist.  I had a bad feeling about Dax Shepard as I could not stand him in Employee of the Month, but I suppose he works better as an idiot in this movie (a lot less acting required) and he did make me laugh more than expected.Even though this movie is full of idiots, it is not intended for them.  I think there's a lot of smart humor and underlying themes to be found beneath the surface.  The social commentary this movie makes can be somewhat over the top but that's what makes it so funny is how far they push it.  There are plenty of moments that felt like an animated comedy and I think the movie would have really played well in animation, but live action with cartoony elements works great too.  There are some who will find this reality far too outlandish, but there's plenty of subtle jokes mixed in as well if you're paying attention.Don't be an idiot and overlook this as nothing more than cheap stupid laughs.  There is plenty of thought behind it if you're in the right frame of mind.

Martin was the brainy one, Murray the muscle lug. Martin would get Murray to do all the tasks while insisting that they worked best because ""You're the strongest, and I'm the smartest!"" At the end of the skit, Murray picks up a boulder and crushes Martin with it...proclaiming ""Now I'm the strongest AND the smartest.""""Idiocracy"" brought that sketch to mind as Joe Bauers (a slacker Luke Wilson) and a Rita, a prostitute played by SNL's Maya Rudolph are thrown 500 years into a future where mad rabbit breeding by trailer-trashers has led to a massive outnumbering of smart people, who held their family growth in check. Ultimately, the only thing left is a populous of monosyllabic mouth breathers who sit on chairs that double as toilets, suck junk food from tubes and have made ""Ow My Balls"" the highest rated show on TV. Imagine Beavis and Butthead as a live action show, and you've got ""Idiocracy.""When Joe and Rita discover that, even as average as they are, they're now the smartest people on the planet, the comedy kicks in. The humor is blacker than black, and it seems more than a little prophetic. In 2006, it's alleged Fox dumped this movie as quickly as they could to perform a contractual obligation to director/writer Mike Judge before throwing it to the DVD market. The story went that Fox wasn't too keen on the vicious anti-consumer message (Fox News in 2500 is being delivered by a naked man and a buxom woman, Starbucks is now a sex parlor and Latte is a euphemism for ""hand-job""). But seeing the ""town halls"" that erupted in 2009, with 'common people' on a rampage about birth certificates and death panels makes me wonder if Judge hadn't discovered the ""time masheen"" in his movie and taken a quickie trip forward. The scene in the hospital where patients are playing slot machines for a chance at health care would be funnier if it didn't seem so much like current affairs.""Idiocracy"" isn't for everyone.

So I thought, why not? Sounds funny.The film starts in the present day with an ""educated"" (read ""white collar"" couple procrastinating as to whether and when they want a child. (They age and don't have any.) In the meantime, some redneck caricatures--if I recall both black and white--are being frutiful and multiplying, due to ignorance of or indifference to contraceptives. Well, one could have a problem with that. There are ""class"" elements that could offend both sides of the political spectrum.To be honest, that's the part of the film at which I laughed the hardest. Yeah, yeah, we educated types can be arrogant. But I was just in Washington yesterday surrounded by some people--again, both black and white--who had more than adequately ""multiplied"" and whom I wouldn't want teaching my kids if I had any.In the meantime, a rather mediocre army noncom finally gets transferred in his job at Fort Myer, or Fort Belvoir--something in the DC area--and becomes part of a long-term sleep experiment. The other, female, subject of that experiment happens to be a lady of the evening.Others have covered the plot: They wake up after a massive garbage pile collapses 500 years later and the world is populated by a bunch of complete, consumerist morons, one of whom is watching the Violence Channel or something like that.I was a little surprised that those who produced the film got away with commentaries on contemporary corporations, restaurants, for example. That was another item at which I laughed a little. Suffice it to say that the language used even in their marketing isn't ""family friendly"" in today's ostensibly more sophisticated environment.As others have said, it's predictable. It's worthwhile as a satire, but lacks the subtlty I'd hope for in, say, a Kubrick film.

The country has forgotten garbage disposal system. The president of USA is an ex-porn star. The most watched comedy show is a dumb slapstick comedy about a guy who keeps getting kicked in his balls and/or falls on his balls over and over again from the start to the end of the show. The Cola companies have made the people so brain dead and people are running softdrinks in their sprinkler systems. Everybody it seems has gotten so dumb that they cannot figure out that  water is required for plants to grow. The crops are dying. Luke Wilson impresses the ex-porn star president (who is an african american) with his seemingly superior IQ. Luke who was a dim wit in his world suddenly finds himself to be the most intelligent guy on the planet. He is entrusted with the responsiblity of growing crops back. He is ridculed and thrown into a Gladiator match when the president and population does not believe in this plan. It is a laugh riot, start to end. Thoroughly enjoyed it. It does not understate or underplay itself, it goes all out for all the gags to make you laugh. And all of this is intelligent and satirical comedy not slapstick. The movie is a caricatural satire of lack of interest in education of the youth, increasing trend of teen sex and pregnancies, and bad social and food lifestyles. It is a satire on a nation hooked on fat junk food and high sugar colas. It comments on trend in breakup of the fabric of marital life and relationships brought on by the stresses of corporate sucess and money. The social satire runs beneath the comedy and can only be interpreted by the viewer, it is not spelt out.regards, Vikram",5,"500 years from now everyone is from the movie - ""Dumb and dumber""",1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,2815,"['Luke', 'Wilson', 'out', 'comedy', 'flick', 'gag', 'minute', 'movie', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'slouch', 'military', 'idea', 'excitement', 'being', 'army', 'librarian', 'do', 'nothing', 'day', 'long', 'prostitute', 'get', 'selected', 'military', 'experiment', 'human', 'hibernation', 'are', 'selected', 'one', 'will', 'miss', 'One', 'chiefs', 'army', 'base', 'arrested', 'being', 'pimp', 'haha', 'thus', 'army', 'base', 'dismantled', 'everyone', 'forgets', 'experiment', '2', 'coffin', 'boxes', 'hibernating', 'subjects', 'lie', 'there', 'undisturbed', 'two', 'wake', 'up', '500', 'years', 'future', 'time', 'are', 'sleeping', 'are', 'given', 'time', 'lapse', 'history', 'evolution', 'human', 'kind', 'rich', 'educated', 'not', 'reproducing', 'uneducated', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'have', 'sex', 'too', 'using', 'rubbers', 'are', 'shown', 'evolution', 'human', 'tree', 'becoming', 'infested', 'uneducated', 'dumb', 'intelligent', 'become', 'rare', 'vanishing', 'endangered', 'species', 'when', 'characters', 'wake', 'up', 'wake', 'up', 'big', 'pile', 'rubbish', 'time', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'dumb', 'one', 'average', 'IQ', '10', 'country', 'forgotten', 'garbage', 'disposal', 'system', 'president', 'USA', 'ex-porn', 'star', 'most', 'watched', 'comedy', 'show', 'dumb', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'guy', 'who', 'getting', 'kicked', 'balls', 'and/or', 'falls', 'balls', 'over', 'again', 'start', 'end', 'show', 'Cola', 'companies', 'have', 'made', 'people', 'so', 'brain', 'dead', 'people', 'are', 'running', 'softdrinks', 'sprinkler', 'systems', 'Everybody', 'gotten', 'so', 'dumb', 'can', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'water', 'required', 'plants', 'grow', 'crops', 'are', 'dying', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'ex-porn', 'star', 'president', 'who', 'african', 'american', 'seemingly', 'superior', 'IQ', 'Luke', 'who', 'was', 'dim', 'wit', 'world', 'suddenly', 'be', 'most', 'intelligent', 'guy', 'planet', 'entrusted', 'responsiblity', 'growing', 'crops', 'back', 'ridculed', 'thrown', 'Gladiator', 'match', 'when', 'president', 'population', 'not', 'believe', 'plan', 'laugh', 'riot', 'start', 'end', 'Thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'understate', 'underplay', 'gags', 'make', 'laugh', 'intelligent', 'satirical', 'comedy', 'not', 'slapstick', 'movie', 'caricatural', 'satire', 'lack', 'interest', 'education', 'youth', 'increasing', 'trend', 'teen', 'sex', 'pregnancies', 'bad', 'social', 'food', 'lifestyles', 'satire', 'nation', 'hooked', 'fat', 'junk', 'food', 'high', 'sugar', 'colas', 'comments', 'trend', 'breakup', 'fabric', 'marital', 'life', 'relationships', 'brought', 'stresses', 'corporate', 'sucess', 'money', 'social', 'satire', 'comedy', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'interpreted', 'viewer', 'not', 'spelt', 'out.regards', 'Vikram']",N/A

Plato foresaw the direction of our society is going over 3,000 years ago. In a democracy, when everyone's vote counts the same, the advantage will go to the intellectual bottom rung, because they compose the biggest number.  C students will always vastly outnumber A+ students.  People with no musical sense or education will buy Justin Bieber, and they will always outnumber those who buy Beethoven.  In a modern democratic society, the less educated class are politically empowered, and therefore economically empowered.  With the economic empowerment of the less educated comes general cultural decline.  This is not to say I oppose democracy, but the point has been made and repeated ad nauseam for 3,000+ years.  What I'm saying is that we should know there IS a price to pay for having democracy, and we should accept the package deal if we choose that package.Many will be quick to point out that it wasn't as bad 50 years ago, although we were a democracy.  But our society wasn't as democratic 50 years ago.  Think about the purchasing power that teenagers had 50 years ago compared to today, and that will explain the popularity of certain music.  Think about the openness our society had toward certain people compared to today.  Today, success is much more attainable for people of lower educational or economic backgrounds, which is great.  But coming with that package is the perceived dominance of perceived stupidity.  Elite culture has not disappeared; in fact, from my personal experience, its quality has continued to improve.  They are just harder to find because they are now, more than ever, greatly outnumbered by other groups that did not have a chance to be heard 50 years ago.The jokes in this movie are old and way too obvious.  The fast food, the urban manners and language, the consumerism, the rednecks. I kept waiting for a fresh plot to form or a new joke to be made.  None was, but even if any, I was uneasy about the stereotyping of urban and rural populations.  Just because they are not the cultural elite does not mean they have to be lumped together with stupidity.  To me, laughing at such platitudes is just as much a representation of cultural decline.

This movie is so sharp and so bottomless in its socio-political perceptiveness that it easily transcends any mass market audience. Fox no doubt hated it because it nails Fox a little too perfectly. I'm amazed the film ever got beyond the concept stage. Forever in the top-ten for Great Satires.Anyway, if you loved Team America (another work of art) you'll probably love this movie and a double-header with those flicks would be a fine evening's entertainment for all. Credit where credit is due though--back in the 70s a similarly inclined satire called ""Americathon"" appeared and vanished almost as quickly. It's never been released on DVD and the VHS is out of print too. Dated but still fun. Idiocracy is so on-the-money though that I worry it won't date for a long time--the decline in our culture that it lampoons is too deeply rooted....and that leads to this: the movie is funny certainly but at times I found it actually somewhat horrifying. The scene where the President addresses Congress immediately comes to mind. This was a nightmare view of democracy that should have had a lot of people thinking. In this regard the film is incredibly subversive--in a time when people seem to be concerned with growing executive power these guys are saying that the real danger to democracy right now is a moronic and self-absorbed electorate. Any Federalists in the audience?The only ""flaw"" in the film is the failure to also indict the dumbing down of our dwindling intelligentsia. I'd assume that issue was bypassed to maintain tight focus but sadly I think a lot of those who were laughing at the triumph of redneck culture need to examine themselves too.Oh, read Bertman's ""Cultural Amnesia"" (and not the new book of the same title by someone else) for a frightening look at the truth behind this film.",5,Brilliant,1184371200,"07 14, 2007",2007,1872,"['top', ""'ll"", 'say', 'so', 'top', 'Swift', 'Rabelais', 'movie', 'so', 'sharp', 'so', 'bottomless', 'socio-political', 'perceptiveness', 'easily', 'mass', 'market', 'audience', 'Fox', 'doubt', 'hated', 'Fox', 'little', 'too', 'perfectly', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'film', 'ever', 'got', 'concept', 'stage', 'Forever', 'top-ten', 'Great', 'Satires.Anyway', 'loved', 'Team', 'America', 'work', 'art', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'movie', 'double-header', 'flicks', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'Credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'back', '70s', 'similarly', 'inclined', 'satire', 'called', 'Americathon', 'appeared', 'vanished', 'almost', 'quickly', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'print', 'too', 'Dated', 'still', 'fun', 'Idiocracy', 'so', 'on-the-money', 'worry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'date', 'long', 'time', 'decline', 'culture', 'too', 'deeply', 'rooted', '.and', 'movie', 'funny', 'certainly', 'times', 'found', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'horrifying', 'scene', 'where', 'President', 'Congress', 'immediately', 'mind', 'was', 'nightmare', 'view', 'democracy', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'lot', 'people', 'thinking', 'regard', 'film', 'incredibly', 'subversive', 'time', 'when', 'people', 'seem', 'be', 'concerned', 'growing', 'executive', 'power', 'guys', 'are', 'saying', 'real', 'danger', 'democracy', 'right', 'now', 'moronic', 'self-absorbed', 'electorate', 'Federalists', 'audience', 'only', 'flaw', 'film', 'failure', 'also', 'indict', 'dumbing', 'dwindling', 'intelligentsia', ""'d"", 'assume', 'issue', 'was', 'bypassed', 'maintain', 'tight', 'focus', 'sadly', 'think', 'lot', 'who', 'were', 'laughing', 'triumph', 'redneck', 'culture', 'need', 'examine', 'too.Oh', 'read', 'Bertman', 'Cultural', 'Amnesia', 'not', 'new', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'someone', 'else', 'frightening', 'look', 'truth', 'film']",N/A

In other words, how do you do a documentary about modern society?It isn't really true that people are becoming less intelligent, but rather that they are increasingly more-poorly educated. By educated, I mean being aware of the world around them and what's going on in it, especially in areas outside their jobs, and beyond the borders of their country. (You can blame the revival of religious fundamentalism for part of this. If you know you're going to be saved, why worry about what's going on at this level of existance?)I've ruined my own life, and am, in many respects, am an insufferably stupid person. But it was only the election of George W. Bush that made me realize just how stupid human beings are. This is a man not much brighter than the people of ""Idiocracy"", ignorant, uneducated, and seemingly proud of it.I have little interest in rock, but was wildly impressed with the way ""Beavis & Butt-head"" so unflinchingly catalogued the decline of Western civilization (or American society, at least). ""Idiocracy"" nicely expands Mike Judge's growing catalog of that decline.Idiocracy's conceit is that, as stupid people are more likely to have children than intelligent people, the world's population will inevitably move in the direction of total dunderheadedness. This is not genetically plausible (ever heard of ""reversion to the mean""?), and it's contradicted by the presence of a lot of high-technology hardware, but no mind. The point is that the idea isn't as important as what you do with it. And Judge does plenty.The richness of Judge's ""confederacy of dunces"" is striking. Particularly notable is the utter vulgarity of social behavior, as if one of the fundamental elements of stupidity is a lack of respect and common courtesy. * And anyone who speaks clearly is a fag.Judge's direction is spot-on. It would have been so easy to play the characters as caricatures, but our future selves are believably stupid and self-absorbed. There's never any sense that we're seeing actors /pretending/ to be dumb (qv, of Jack Nicholson in ""Prizzi's Honor"" or Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man""). Dax Shepard, as Frito, Joe's incompetent attorney, gives a truly remarkable performance that, in a just world, would have gotten him an Oscar nomination.At a terse 84 minutes, ""Idiocracy"" ends before wearing out its welcome. And Judge's dystopia is so richly imagined that you'll have to watch two or three times, your finger poised over the pause button, to catch everything.It is no surprise that Fox showed this film in five theaters, then pulled it. Granted, preview audiences hated it. Does that prove anything? Well, it shows that Fox management is even more stupid than the preview audienes.My highest recommendation. Unreseveredly recommended.PS: I watched it last night (5/29/2011). As funny as ever. We really need a Blu-ray edition.

Kornbluth short story ""The Marching Morons,"" which you should read immediately. But while the intent here is primarily satiric, it's no less unsettling. Let's face it, the dumbed-down world depicted in the film exists right now -- the yahoo anti-intellectualism, the automatic homophobia, the glorification of the lowest common denominator -- it's all around us today. Worse, it's praised by political pundits & cultural critics who fear anything more complex than a sound bite or bumper sticker slogan, who promote ""intelligent design"" & other junk science over genuine science in our schools, who prefer infotainment & empty bloviating over incisive, in-depth reporting. (Note how Fox Studios buried the film, perhaps due to its scathingly accurate portrayal of Fox ""News"" & its happily unthinking audience.)So why four stars instead of five? The film, while short, drags in a few places, offering some wonderfully satiric ideas but not always following through on them. I enjoyed it, and it made me think, but it also left me feeling as if more could have been done with it. For example, it would have been interesting to see the state of religion in this dystopian future, or the fate of libraries.Still, it has an important point to make, and enough hilarious (if sadly true to life) ideas to make it well worth watching.

So you knew who's [...] it was, and why it was farting.""Idiocracy presents a future America (the year 2505) in which an average military guy from 2005(Luke Wilson) is put into a hibernation unit for the army and taken out 500 years later to find that he is the smartest guy in the country.The main theme of Idiocracy is incredibly relevant at this point in America's history. Humans have no natural predators, medical discoveries have extended people's lives, and it does seem that our culture is increasingly worshipping ignorance. (Look at Paris Hilton, Jessica Simpson, or any reality tv show, for examples of this). Idiocracy makes the case that in the future, we will not in fact be smarter, but will be dumber, because of the dumbing down of society that we are experiencing now.The movie is thought-provoking, but in the South Park way, where you don't feel as if you're being preached at or talked down to. And if you are stupid, you can still laugh at the fart jokes, although they come with a touch of irony in this film.The main drawback of this movie is it seems like it was a bit ambitious for the budget it had. A lot of the scenery looks very cartoony (and this may have been the intention), but it takes away from the story. Also, the DVD doesn't offer much by way of special features: just 5 deleted scenes.Overall, though, the entire movie is funny and the laughs keep coming. I have no idea why Fox wouldn't want to put out a marketing campaign for this movie and release it to a broader range of people, but it could stem from the reality of what's being portrayed in the film.
