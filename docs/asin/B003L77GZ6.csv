While sometimes men can be, this show is beautifully well written and touches,on some of exactly the issues older men face. Three different types of men are portrayed, by probably three of the nest actors of our generation. The casting is outstanding and of course,even though the show was critically acclaimed, TNT , AS WITH OTHER NETWORKS, would rather broadcast crap,childish nonsense, than a well written and powerful show. I am quite frankly disgusted with the junk on TV and cable, and not sure why quality programming is replaced with brainless idiocy. Well, actually I am as idiocy apparently sellers commercials or whatever, and shows like this don't. This won the Peabody award and earned several other nominations. The DVD itself is standard fare, with a few good special features on each disk. It leaves you a little empty, because just as it ended, all three characters faced life changing and critical issues.

1353358,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B003L77GZ6,,"[2, 2]","Tale focuses on three guys all pushing 50 who have known one another since their college days. I'd say one of the biggest themes is a combination of things not going as expected (one is recently divorced b/c of his gambling addiction; another is trying to make it as an actor; and the other is working for his father and hating it) and trying to go down the right path of life yet things don't work out so what do you do then? The overall chemistry between these three characters (all played by very good or better actors) makes the show work. No chemistry and no humor between three guys and this show would be dead in the water. The overall authenticity of real life problems and how they are dealt with makes this particular TV show refreshing. Some of the supporting characters, like the bookieand Ray's imaginary son, truly stand out. I discovered this show while running on the elliptic at my gym (they have a bunch of TVs on the wall). People on a budget can watch a few free episodes at the TNT site.

It is wonderful to see a show about three men who reach fifty.  One of the big moments for them is getting up the nerve to all get colonoscopies together--how much realer can middle age get?Mirroring the rest of the country, these guys are having troubles adjusting to the changing economics going on in the USA just as everyone else is.  However, the bigger problem for each of them is sewn more deeply into who they are as people than what is going on in the country.Our gambler can never really get away from gambling.  He is always poised on the edge of destroying his and others' lives the very minute he starts thinking in gambling terms.  It doesn't take much.  This time it is no more than an opportunity which comes his way when his bookie has to go through chemo.  Ray Romano does an excellent job of portraying a man who is unlikable a great deal of the time for this reason but he does have his moments where he someone you can like.Once again the auto sales family is my favorite. The son is still trying to salvage the mess his father has made of his car dealership.  He is not a super duper salesman himself so he has to find other means to satisfy and inspire the employees.  His father is one of the most difficult people imaginable to get along with as a person, much less a relative. The son remains someone you like almost all of the time as he is used to trying to satisfy such an impossible person.The actor becomes a car salesman for his friend.  However he is bedeviled by a number of things.  One, he can never entirely let go of acting, he still thinks of himself as maybe making it, even though he's 50 now. This and his need to always conquer another female loom as serious jinxes for destroying his one real shot at a marriage.  He becomes absolutely ridiculous in one episode with his newest early 20s girlfriend and her parents, who are his age, or younger. You get irritated with him, wish he would grow up, but in the end, he is also someone people tend to like.So on balance I think I have to give Ray Romano a lot of credit.  For a guy who made his fortune in stand up and a long running sitcom on network tv, he sure shows in this role that he can play a guy with serious character flaws which always put his character on the edge and in question.  These are serious dramatic chops he displays in this show in both seasons.It is a shame this has been cancelled.  Perhaps if HBO, Showtime or AMC had broadcast it instead of TNT, it would still be around.",5,Second Season Also Superb,1320796800,"11 9, 2011",2011,2591,"['three', 'guys', 'resume', 'middle', 'aged', 'lives', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'again', 'do', 'superb', 'job', 'wonderful', 'see', 'show', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'reach', 'fifty', 'One', 'big', 'moments', 'getting', 'up', 'nerve', 'get', 'colonoscopies', 'together', 'how', 'much', 'realer', 'can', 'middle', 'age', 'get', 'Mirroring', 'rest', 'country', 'guys', 'are', 'having', 'troubles', 'adjusting', 'changing', 'economics', 'going', 'USA', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'However', 'bigger', 'problem', 'sewn', 'more', 'deeply', 'who', 'are', 'people', 'what', 'going', 'country.Our', 'gambler', 'can', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'away', 'gambling', 'always', 'poised', 'edge', 'destroying', 'others', 'very', 'minute', 'thinking', 'gambling', 'terms', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'time', 'more', 'opportunity', 'way', 'when', 'bookie', 'go', 'chemo', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'man', 'who', 'unlikable', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'reason', 'have', 'moments', 'where', 'someone', 'can', 'like.Once', 'again', 'auto', 'sales', 'family', 'favorite', 'son', 'still', 'trying', 'salvage', 'mess', 'father', 'made', 'car', 'dealership', 'not', 'super', 'duper', 'salesman', 'find', 'other', 'means', 'satisfy', 'inspire', 'employees', 'father', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'people', 'imaginable', 'get', 'along', 'person', 'much', 'less', 'relative', 'son', 'someone', 'almost', 'time', 'used', 'trying', 'satisfy', 'impossible', 'person.The', 'actor', 'car', 'salesman', 'friend', 'However', 'bedeviled', 'number', 'things', 'One', 'can', 'never', 'entirely', 'let', 'go', 'acting', 'still', 'maybe', 'making', 'even', '50', 'now', 'need', 'always', 'conquer', 'female', 'loom', 'serious', 'jinxes', 'destroying', 'one', 'real', 'shot', 'marriage', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'one', 'episode', 'newest', 'early', '20s', 'girlfriend', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'age', 'younger', 'get', 'irritated', 'wish', 'would', 'grow', 'up', 'end', 'also', 'someone', 'people', 'tend', 'like.So', 'balance', 'think', 'have', 'give', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'lot', 'credit', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'fortune', 'stand', 'up', 'long', 'running', 'sitcom', 'network', 'tv', 'sure', 'role', 'can', 'play', 'guy', 'serious', 'character', 'flaws', 'always', 'put', 'character', 'edge', 'question', 'are', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'chops', 'show', 'seasons.It', 'shame', 'been', 'cancelled', 'Perhaps', 'HBO', 'Showtime', 'AMC', 'had', 'broadcast', 'instead', 'TNT', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'around']",N/A
