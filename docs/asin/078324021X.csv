Watching Kostner here and then contrasting his performance in ""Tin Cup"" is great fun; the man does have range. For DVD watchers, you will be so sad that more of Billy Chapel's private life was not shown in the film as released. The deleted scenes -- his empty encounters with women, his closeness to his teammates -- make his retirement prospects all the more desperate. Something went wrong with the writing for Kelly Preston's ""Jane""; her character doesn't add up. She makes a ridiculous scene in front of a very famous hotel with fans of Chapel's all around; there is no basis for either the scene or her language and attitude in the script, it's gratuitous conflict. But the final moments of that Perfect Game make me cry every time I watch them.",4,Movie buffs: look at the deleted scenes!,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,870,"['loved', 'movie', 'brought', 'back', 'old', 'love', 'baseball.It', 'touching', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'photographed', 'Watching', 'Kostner', 'here', 'then', 'contrasting', 'performance', 'Tin', 'Cup', 'great', 'fun', 'man', 'have', 'range', 'DVD', 'watchers', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'sad', 'more', 'Billy', 'Chapel', 'private', 'life', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'film', 'released', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'empty', 'encounters', 'women', 'closeness', 'teammates', 'make', 'retirement', 'prospects', 'more', 'desperate', 'Something', 'went', 'wrong', 'writing', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'Jane', 'character', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'ridiculous', 'scene', 'front', 'very', 'famous', 'hotel', 'fans', 'Chapel', 'around', 'basis', 'scene', 'language', 'attitude', 'script', 'gratuitous', 'conflict', 'final', 'moments', 'Perfect', 'Game', 'make', 'cry', 'time', 'watch']",N/A
68311,A1AAN285FE45GP,078324021X,A. Fultz,"[0, 1]","Kevin Costner again delivers a fine performance as an aging ballplayer at a crossroads in his life.  Unlike in Bull Durham, this time Costner plays a &quot;sure-fire Hall of Famer&quot; who may be pitching his last game in  the bigs.  Most of the story centers on this game, with Costner's character  Billy Chappel looking back through flashbacks to key moments in his life  and career.  Most of the flashbacks deal with the end of the pitcher's  romance with his girlfriend, played by Kelly Preston.  The romance itself  is lukewarm, and at times it seems the only reason these two are together  is because the script says so.  John C. Reilly does a great job as the  veteran catcher also looking at his last shot of glory.  Jena Malone and  Anthony Fultz are winners in supporting roles.  While the romance plays out  well, there should have been more attention played to the flashbacks of  other portions of the pitcher's life and career.  His parents and fellow  players are given too little time in the flashbacks, and some storylines  are left ripe on the vine.  Real baseball fans will groan at some of this  movie (if you know that Frank Robinson is fourth all-time on the career  homerun list, don't expect greatness here), but overall, the actors do a  decent job as major leaguers.  Vin Scully adds the most realism for the  real baseball fan. Overall, this movie rates high.  It loses points for  undeveloped stories, but still scores big. For all the buildup, the ending  falls a little flat.  A few may shed tears at the end of the baseball game,  but this is no &quot;Brian Song&quot;, so men may not cry.

The result is a solid time at bat, but not extra bases.Costner makes you feel all the bursting athleticism, confidence, energy, and thoughts, of a great but aging pitcher in the early innings, and all his aches and pains, doubt and fatigue, as the game wears on. The actual baseball scenes are very realistic, with Costner doing his own pitching.This film captures some of the precious little moments of baseball, such as the sizzle of a pitched ball, and the relationship between two friends, the pitcher and the catcher. Another strong point is that it captures the glowing voice of broadcaster Vin Scully, who I've listened to since I grew up a Dodger fan in New Jersey and the Dodgers were in Brooklyn. (Like another reviewer I wonder if Scully wrote his own dialogue. It sounded exactly like the way he broadcasts a real game.) The scenes of Yankee fans yelling at the TV as the broken-down pitcher neared the perfect game took me back 40 years. I yelled exactly the same things at our TV set when I watched Don Larsen pitch the last few innings of his perfect game against my Dodgers in 1956.On the downside, someone made the decision to go over the top in the last scenes of both the baseball game and the romance. The music score, which has been wonderful and hitting all the right emotional notes until then, turns gushing and maudlin.The film would have been more emotionally resonant and ultimately more satisfying with a quieter ending to both the baseball and the romantic storylines. For example, the deleted scenes, such as the after-the-game congratulations from the opposing players in the clubhouse, have an emotional depth to them that emphasize how much of his emotional life the pitcher is losing, and how empty even a big moment can be if there's no one to share it with.Kudos to Costner for a terrific performance as the pitcher, John C. Reilly for his strong support as the catcher, Kelly Preston for a fine turn as Costner's on-and-off again love interest, and Jena Malone, who really shines as Preston's daughter.To the reviewers who think the movie is too slow, you've been watching too many movies and too much TV that ignores character and story-telling and replaces it with a dozen explosions, fights, car chases, crashes, and special effects every minute, all shot by a relentlessly moving camera, and edited at an absurdly over-caffeinated staccato pace.Slow down!

He also wroteTHE KILLER ANGELS, the historical novel thatGETTYSBURG(1993) is adapted from.FOR LOVE OF THE GAME is the third and final inning of Kevin Costner's baseball trilogy. The previous films areBULL DURHAM(1988) andFIELD OF DREAMS(1989). Adding to the realism here are the ""House that Ruth Built,"" long-time Stadium announcer Bob Sheppard, plus actual MLB umpires and Yankees minor leaguers as Costner's opponents.""For Love"" is a date movie that has romance for the ladies and a Tigers/Yankees ballgame for the guys. Here, 40-year-old pitcher Costner has lost the woman he loves because of his own inconsiderate behavior. While obsessing over this recent breakup and Preston's plans to move to London, he's called upon to pitch a season finale that may be the final game of his career.As the innings unfold we flash back over Costner's and Preston's turbulent 5-year relationship, while on the mound in the present he's doing the near-impossible: pitching a perfect game.Although on-field segments are well-done and tension-filled, the story is compromised by being too bifurcated. Watching this is much like channel surfing two TV stations every few minutes. It's good, but surely the weakest of the Costner diamond trio.

68320,A2582KMXLK2P06,078324021X,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","You know, one of these days I'll see a Kevin Costner movie I actually like.  So far, he's been really underwhelming to me.Anyway, the reason I watched For Love of the Game this afternoon is because I'm a fan of the Detroit Tigers (or as I prefer to call them, the Motor City Kitties!)There's no clear reason why I'm a fan- ever since I fell in love with baseball back in '93 when my Philadelphia Phillies went to the World Series, it's been a sport that always fascinated me because the possibilities seem endless.  For some reason the Tigers stood out to me.  It's like they were never acknowledged, never given proper respect, and never given attention whatsoever by the baseball announcers.  This is why the '06 season when they went to the World Series meant a LOT to me.  Best year ever (well, besides the '08 World Series of course, hehe).I can sit here and ramble useless baseball nonsense until I bore everyone to tears, so let's get to the review, shall we?This movie sort of stinks.  According to the information, it's supposed to be a drama but in all honesty it's partially a drama, but mostly a romantic snore fest.  It drags on and ON.  It's about Kevin Costner being a Detroit Tigers pitcher and winding down in his career mostly due to an injury forcing him into constant media pressure debating an early retirement.  After witnessing a few innings of Kevin Costner pitching against the Yankees (and WOW do the Tigers ever play the Yankees quite a bit throughout the season!) the film then goes back in time to 5 years before and builds the story from *this* time period when he would meet what would become his future girlfriend/wife.  She's parked alongside the road on a busy highway with car troubles, and of course Costner plays the ladies man by pulling over and helping her out.  I hated this scene but it shows exactly what to expect for the next 1 hour and 45 minutes.From here, the film occasionally shows Kevin Costner pitching more games, but it mostly (to my utter disappointment) switches to a NEW direction and focuses around Costner and his relationship troubles.  First of all, For Love of the Game most certainly does NOT need to be 2 hours long, especially when a good portion of it centers around Kevin Costner and his tricky girlfriend either carrying pointless conversations that never build into anything worthwhile nor accomplish anything, the two of them making out, or concerning Kevin Costner getting to know the womans daughter (that she conveniently failed to mention until halfway through).For this reason, I highly recommend all sports fans AVOID this movie like the plague.

Sam Raimi  (Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, Army of Darkness) directs and Kevin Costner (  Bull Durham, The Bodyguard) stars in this story of an aging baseball star  struggling over the future of his career and his love life.The entire  movie takes place in one afternoon, as Costner stands on the pitchers mound  in the middle of Yankee Stadium. As he pitches in what could be his last  game, he begins to look back on his life in a series of flashbacks. He  begins to remember his often stormy romance with his long time ""on again,  off again"" girlfriend, played by Kelly Preston (Jerry McGuire, Jack Frost).  As the movie plays on we are given little bits of insight as to the events  the have played out between Costner and Preston. While he stands in  reflection of his life, he must pitch against the Bronx Bombers in what is  essentially a meaningless game. But as the game wears on, everyone with the  exception of Costner realizes that he is pitching a perfect game, perhaps  the rarest of pitching achievements. The drama builds at the end when you  begin to wonder if he will indeed finish the perfect game, and if he and  Preston will end up together.Costner does a very good job of playing the  veteran pitcher (he played a veteran catcher in much the same position in  ""Bull Durham"" several years earlier) trying to come to grips with the end  of his career and the possible end of a relationship. Costner is a good fit  in an athletic role, and makes the character believable. I still think all  of his movies spend too much time in a close up of his face, but all things  considered it goes over well. Preston is very likable as his long time  girlfriend, tiring of playing second fiddle to the game, and there are  several strong supporting performances, but the voice of legendary baseball  man Vin Scully brings a feeling of true reality to the film.I am not a  big fan of a movie told almost entirely in flashback, but once I got used  to it, I did enjoy it. It does seem to be a little disjointed at times, but  it makes its point. I liked the plot and the cast, but at times Costner  becomes too philosophical, and I could do without all the up close shots of  Kevin's face. At this point in his career, if people haven't noticed that  he's handsome they never will. That's why I gave it a four.

But, one thing is certain, it's possible to play the game of his life in one and only game : it's called  the perfect game. And Kevin Costner, in director Samuel Raimi's FOR LOVE OF  THE GAME, is on his way for it.FOR LOVE OF THE GAME is a typical genre  movie, the hero can't be happy until he has fulfilled the dream of his  life, until he is part of america's history. With this theme, you're sure  to attract the local audience's votes. It's human.So, the quality of the  movie depends only on the director's skill or desire to play some  variations on this common theme. For instance, until now, in my opinion,  Barry Levinson's THE NATURAL with Robert Redford is clearly the best  baseball related movie ever filmed.After a western and a film noir,  Samuel Raimi is going to shock one more time his long-time supporters with  FOR LOVE OF THE GAME. No more hysterical travellings and zooms, not a  single gunshot, the young &quot;crazy horse&quot; director, like Kevin  CHAPEL Costner, has an eighteen years career behind him.

A once great pitcher for the Detroit Tigers on the brink of retirement. It's a story of a man who's got the biggest decision of his life/career to make...being traded by the new owners of the ball club and keep playing but for another team other than the only team he has ever known Professionally...or retirement?...If you're a use to be athlete...this tugs at your heart, taking you back to the last time you were able to suit up and play the greatest game in the world...baseball! Billy is a man who's obviously in love with the game and is having a heck of a time letting her go. Now by using the word ""her'...i can describe both the game of baseball and Billy's ""on again,off again"" relationship with Jane Aubrey(the very Beautiful Kelly Preston), a New York Fashion magazine Editor who's more than a lil' hesitant with Costner's character's old school approach with their realtionship. Billy thinks (like i and countless other guys have) like a typical guy who takes advantage of a good thing to the point that he drives it away. Billy is old school and he isn't willing to commit to Jane, which she deperately needs him to do. Jane has been done wrong in the past more than a few times. She's a single mom of a teenage girl( played by the very CUTE Jena Malone)who's starting to challenge her mom's ways. In all ways this movie is just about life! Single parenting, being a stubborn man, relationships with friends, saying goodbye, the love of a good woman... and o'h yeah...the deepest love a man can have for the game of Baseball. The movie is set during the last game of what has been a very rough season for Billy and the Tigers. Inning by inning Billy goes through refections of his relationship with Jane and Heather(Jena's character), his career as a dominant pitching god for one team,the Detroit Tigers & everything from a career threatning injury and just plain old woman trouble. He's had a good life as a ball player but his career is coming to a close and now he has the decision of retirement or playing for another team. All the while his heart is with Jane but he is too stubborn to tell her how he really feels and just about pushes her completely away. Like a typical guy, Billy realizes and goes after her at all costs...Did i forget to mention the fact that this is all going on during a game that Billy just so happens to be pitching a perfect game in?...news of the sale of the Tigers forces Billy's hand to make a decision of retirement or trade...this triggers Billy's reflections. He realizes that's he's in love with Jane and he needs more than just ""the game"" to be complete in life. In typical Movie fashion Billy pitches the perfect game, retires, and goes after Jane. In the ending scene,Billy pours his heart to Jane at the airport in New York...he palns to chase her overseas but by chance she delays her flight to watch the game and is wrestling with her own feelings for Billy and trusting him. All in all, this is a great movie especially for the Costner buffs out there. I personally love all of Costner's baseball movies and i'd put this one at the top of my personal list!

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[16, 19]","My son, a former college pitcher, absolutely adored this film--not because of the overall story, but because of the head games pitchers play on the mound.  And to its credit, FOR LOVE OF THE GAME vividly depicts a day out on the hill for a major league pitcher at the twilight of his career, Detroit Tiger ace Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner).  My son instantly identified with Chapel's talking to himself between pitches, trying to get inside the head of the batter (What's he expecting?  Fastball or breaking ball?), hoping that his next pitch will throw the batter off balance.  And finally, Chapel's ability to completely shut out all noise and distractions (&quot;Clear the mechanism,&quot; he says to himself.) was very effective.And those are the highlights of the movie.  Unfortunately, FOR LOVE OF THE GAME is a compilation of flashbacks centering around a contrived love story that has been rehashed and recycled thousands of times.  Director Sam Raimi gives us a story about the on-again/off-again relationship between Chapel and Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston), a magazine exec.  Chapel is unwilling to make a commitment, while Jane's pessimistic insecurity about the relationship becomes downright annoying.  Costner is so wooden in these scenes he appears to be going through the motions, while Preston whines and pines like a high school sophomore.  The final scene between the two of them, in the airport, is uncomfortable to watch.John C. Reilly turns in an admirable performance as grisly veteran catcher Gus Sinski, and the soothing voice of Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully lends wonderful credibility to the drama as Chapel makes a bid to pitch a perfect game.

The poor guy gave us such a string of mediocre movies at one point that it was starting to become depressing. But then Field of Dreams (which holds a permanent place in my movie collection) kept staring at me from its spot on the shelf, reminding me not to give up hope on Kevin.  And I'm glad!For Love of the Game is, of course, a baseball movie...and I have to admit that I am somewhat of a baseball-movie fan so I first watched it with the anticipation that I'd like it for that aspect if nothing else.  Fortunately, I liked the rest of it too.Nearing the end of his 19th year with the Detroit Tigers, Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is faced with his past, present, and future, and is forced to think through them all during the final game of the season against the  NY Yankees.  The movie flips between the past and present throughout the game giving us a good background story on Billy and the love-of-his-life, Jane, played Kelly Preston.  The movie does a good job of character development...which is important since a story is only as good as its characters.  If you don't care about them, then why bother?  This is particularly true with a love story.Kevin Costner did a job like I haven't seen since his Field of Dreams days...or perhaps he always acts this well and this was a better storyline than Waterworld or The Postman so I could really tell.  Kelly Preston (Addicted to Love, Jerry Maguire) was also excellent.  Preston is one of those actresses that every time I see her in something, I can barely tell that it's the same girl.  I think she has a real talent for totally becoming her role, which draws you in, and you either love her or hate her, depending upon who she is.  Love her in this part.Just so you know, the film wasn't perfect.  Most of its minor flaws are overlook-able, but I did find the first 15 minutes or so didn't seem to fit as well into the rest of the movie.  It all seems fine until they give you all that background detail and you gain a better understanding of who Billy and Jane are and what their relationship has been.  In fact, if they cut those first few minutes, I'd probably be able to figure out what was going on without them.  It wasn't a particularly strong opener for what turned out to be a strong film.Definitely a good date movie.",5,For love of more than just the game,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,2355,"['Loved', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'say', 'about', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'film', 'poor', 'guy', 'gave', 'string', 'mediocre', 'movies', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'starting', 'become', 'depressing', 'then', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'permanent', 'place', 'movie', 'collection', 'kept', 'staring', 'spot', 'shelf', 'reminding', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'hope', 'Kevin', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Love', 'Game', 'course', 'baseball', 'movie', 'have', 'admit', 'am', 'somewhat', 'baseball-movie', 'fan', 'first', 'watched', 'anticipation', ""'d"", 'like', 'aspect', 'nothing', 'else', 'Fortunately', 'liked', 'rest', 'too.Nearing', 'end', '19th', 'year', 'Detroit', 'Tigers', 'Billy', 'Chapel', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'faced', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'forced', 'think', 'final', 'game', 'season', 'NY', 'Yankees', 'movie', 'past', 'present', 'game', 'giving', 'good', 'background', 'story', 'Billy', 'love-of-his-life', 'Jane', 'played', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'character', 'development', 'important', 'story', 'only', 'as', 'good', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'then', 'why', 'bother', 'particularly', 'true', 'love', 'story.Kevin', 'Costner', 'did', 'job', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'days', 'perhaps', 'always', 'well', 'was', 'better', 'storyline', 'Waterworld', 'Postman', 'could', 'really', 'tell', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'Addicted', 'Love', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'Preston', 'one', 'actresses', 'time', 'see', 'something', 'can', 'barely', 'tell', 'same', 'girl', 'think', 'real', 'talent', 'totally', 'becoming', 'role', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'depending', 'who', 'Love', 'part.Just', 'so', 'know', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'Most', 'minor', 'flaws', 'are', 'overlook-able', 'did', 'find', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'movie', 'fine', 'give', 'background', 'detail', 'gain', 'better', 'understanding', 'who', 'Billy', 'Jane', 'are', 'what', 'relationship', 'been', 'fact', 'cut', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'strong', 'opener', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'strong', 'film.Definitely', 'good', 'date', 'movie']",N/A

Raimi is a talented director to be reckoned with, and this film is a testament to that.Kevin Costner portrays a baseball player who in the twilight of his career.  He was once a dominating pitcher, but time has eroded some of his skills and he can sense his last stroll to the pitcher's mound is near.Kelly Preston plays his on-again / off-again love interest after a chance meeting.  Kelly has always been beautiful, and this might be her finest performance to date.The story is told via flashbacks while the Detroit Tiger's hurler pursues every baseball pitcher's dream:  a perfect game.  It comes on the last game of the season vs. the most storied franchise in the game (the Yankess) at perhaps the most storied stadium in all of sports (Yankee stadium).  It also is the last game of the season, and perhaps the last game of his career.While some may find the story a bit longwinded, I thought that the film was evenly paced & told well.  We have to remember that they're trying to encompass a player's entire career with various anecdotes  & memories (some good, some not-so-good).  Costner can be bland in some movies, but this was one of his better outings - up there withDances with Wolves - Extended Cut (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)andThe Guardian.If you're looking for a date movie, this one just might be perfect.  Women will love it as it can pass for a chick flick.  Men will like it because it's also a sports movie.  Both genders will appreciate the satiric humor that's directed towards sports ""know-it-alls"" that we've all encountered in our lives.

""For the Love of the Game"" did a lot for me in bringing back fond memories of the game which I used to love when I was a kid.  Costner's sports movies  are among his most entertaining, and bringing in Vin Skully added  tremendously to the realism of this film.Although I do agree (somewhat)  in many reviewers' disappointment concerning the relationship aspect in  this film, it still held enough interest for me that I enjoyed the film as  a whole (heck, I almost bought it hook-line-and-sinker, but then again, I  can be a real sucker).  I also liked how the love aspect of the story was  told in flashbacks as Chapel (Costner) was pitching the game of his life.  I believe that many people may actually enjoy this film who are not  baseball fans, but it sure couldn't hurt if you were.Between 1 and 10, I  give ""For the Love of the Game"" a solid 7.  It's nice to see an actor who  is athletic enough to pull off a sports movie and make it look real.  Some  of the scenes (where people are watching the ""game"" on television, ala  Kelly Preston at the airport bar) looked 100 percent authentic.

Maybe he thought that because he made two baseball themed pictures that were popular and well received by critics and audiences he could fool us into enjoying another. Well, this overly long (more than two mind numbing hours), sappy, and sentimental flick was just more than one person can bear. It might have been okay, worthy of two stars, had the picture shaved off half an hour of the tale which was much more a DULL love story than it was about America's pastime. (I would prefer a film about the latter, more like The Natural with Robert Redford and Glenn Close). Kelly Preston is almost invariably annoying, and this role is no exception. Somehow the relationship between Preston and Costner's characters are not at all believable and are completely contrived. Dialogue is very... superficial and what makes it worse is its obvious aims for something more sophisticated than it was. These relationship films are a delicate sort of thing, and it takes a special skill to pull them off. Costner and Preston don't have the chemistry to make it happen, and the story is just too... sentimental. Costner's character, an aging baseball pitcher, is making what will be his last appearance in major league baseball, and while he is on the mound (and happens to achieve the grandiose no-hitter as an amazing cap to his, of course-cinematically-amazing career) he reminisces about his relationship with Preston's character. Earlier on the morning of the game, he is notified by the owner of the team that the team is changing ownership and rather than trade Costner, the owner thinks it would be a graceful time for Costner to bow out of baseball, while he is still at the top. Just after this, Billy (Costner's character) is dumped by Preston's character, Jane. Naturally this sends the middle-aged softie (yes, and in all these memories he so generously shares with us for more than two hours of out lives he shows himself to be the kind of guy we all hope to find... the guy who loves us for who we are, who loves our children from previous relationships, and someone who really needs us... which is at the heart of the relationship between Billy and Jane. She thinks he does not need her) into a middle-aged reverie... looking back on the good times, and sadly, the bad.

Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is a veteran pitcher with an accomplished career who is headed for the Hall of Fame.  On the day we meet him he has a  lot on his mind.  He is informed that his team is being sold, he is being  traded and the love of his life is moving to England.  Add to this the pain  in his pitching arm, his impending decision on whether to retire and the  fact that winning this game is critical in determining if the Yankees go to  the playoffs, and you have a man with overloaded neurons.The story  unfolds as an introspective retrospective.  As he is pitching this  important game, he is thinking about his childhood, his relationship with  Jane (Kelly Preston) and how he is going to get the next batter out.  He is  so preoccupied that it doesn't even dawn on him until the eighth inning  that there have been no Yankee hits and he has been pitching a perfect  game.The flashback elements are expertly woven into the game, giving  us a genuine feeling for his distraction.  This is a fresh perspective for  a sports movie.  Instead of simply focusing on what the player is doing,  the film focuses on what he is thinking while he is doing it.  It gives us  an authentic look at how athletes get ""in the zone"", filtering out all the  noise and concentrating totally on their performance.  Those who have been  involved in athletic competition can identify with this state, although  only the best can achieve it at will.Sam Raimi's direction on this film  was excellent.  His direction of the love story was nothing special, but he  did a superb job on the baseball scenes.  The combination of on the field  action, commentary by Vin Scully and simulated TV telecast footage was so  well done that it was impossible to differentiate it from a major league  game in progress.The acting ranged from fair to excellent.  Kelly  Preston was very good as Jane.  She brought a full range of emotional  expression to the part, though she sometimes got a little shrill, like the  scene in the hospital where she screams out ""Is this America?  Is baseball  still the national pastime.""  Overall though, she played the part of the  torn lover very well.Kevin Costner is no great lead actor and it is hard  to understand why he is so popular.  Perhaps it is his whiny lost boy charm  that makes women want to mother him.  In the love story, he again presented  as listless and uninspired.  But in the baseball scenes, he came alive.  In  fact, in these scenes Costner was not acting so much as acting out.  He  loves baseball and was obsessed with doing all his own baseball scenes.  He  is a top notch athlete, so he really could throw a curveball and his  fastball had plenty of pop.  His ability to portray a professional athlete  in this instance was superlative, probably due to his having played the  game scholastically.  So overall, I would have to rate his performance  here as very good.John Reilly gets a very honorable mention as Chapel's  catcher.  He was quietly supportive and unobtrusive, the way catchers  usually are.  He portrayed intense desire in a demure and low key way  without overacting.  It was a nice performance by an actor in a supporting  role playing a baseball player in a supporting role.I love baseball and  this was a great baseball movie so I rated it 8/10.

I was a bit surprised when this film first came out because it didn't really seem like his kinda thing but I knew he could pull it off. The result is a really good baseball movie that really isn't about baseball, and Mr. Raimi did a great job with it. I went to the theaters to see this at the time of it's release and walked out thinking ""that was a pretty good movie"".Based on a novel by Michael Shaara this is the story of Billy Chapel [Costner] a baseball legend at the end of his career and the end of his love life. It is the final game of the year and all he wants is to ignore the pain in his arm and give it one last go. Add into the fact that his lover Jane Aubrey [Kelly Preston] is tired of him and is moving on. This movie is really about this man's journey to finding himself, to bad he does that while playing a career making game. Or maybe it is because of that that he is pitching a career making game. It seems that while he is on the plate thinking about his life with her he is throwing the perfect game, and doesn't even know it. Towards the end when he starts to realize it he starts to go into a slump.Sam Raimi shows a bit of a different approach and style with his direction in this film, it is more of a conservative style. The pace is good and the film transcends between present and past easily, but the last third of the film is excellent. Screenwriter Dana Stevens did a great job adapting the book into a film although I will admit that I have not read the book. Costner is good in the role of the fading legend and seems right at home on the plate, his scenes with Preston are good as well but just don't seem big enough. Kelly Preston is great in this film and plays the emotional unstable Jane perfectly. J.K Simmons is excellent as the head coach for Costner's team but does not get enough screen time in my opinion. Still it is John C. Reilly who is my favorite in this movie, as always he is great. He plays the catcher and the guy who is helping get Billy threw, excellent performance.The best thing about this film is by far the baseball parts, just the way it was filmed and edited was great. As for the love story it is good and well done but it just falls short of being that classic love story, not sure what a good example would be.

68352,A2P4AKDAI7ERSE,078324021X,Fred Ritzema,"[3, 4]","It used to be that in order to get &quot;inside a character's head&quot; you had to read a book, where the author had many pages to use for character and plot development.  Most very good- excellent movies have only 90-120 minutes to do the same, and many fall flat on their faces.  They either focus too much on the game action or on insight into the characters.  Either one can lead to total boredom, depending on your taste for baseball or your taste for &quot;inner-man/woman&quot; stories.  Under Sam Raimi's direction, &quot;For Love of the Game&quot; has a unique blend of personal/relationship development, really, REALLY getting inside Billy Chapel's head, and real-time/flashback moments that give this picture its balance and appeal.  Some &quot;professional&quot; entertainment critics whose musings I follow, either for laughs or information, have called Kevin Costner's acting abilities &quot;wooden&quot;, &quot;lackluster&quot;, &quot;impersonal&quot;, or lacking the &quot;human touch&quot;.  In most cases, they are far off the evaluation mark---as far as I'm concerned.  It is so in this case.  You might as well use the words &quot;gushy-mushy drivel&quot; to sum up their writings about &quot;For Love....&quot;  The relationship between pitcher (Costner) and catcher (John C. Reilly) establishes the soul of this baseball tale.  The prologue photos of Billy Chapel gives a peek at how he developed his &quot;love of the game&quot;.  It's been his WHOLE life.  Catcher Gus Sinski(Reilly) knows his teammate virtually inside out and can read Chapel's mind looking through the cage-like mask.  Thus his comment late in the movie &quot;You're worn out.  You don't have any stuff on the ball. But WE (his team-mates) are here for you NOW&quot;.  And so they are.  Balancing the baseball drama is a relationship one. Enter Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston), a woman who does NOT want any one else in her life right now, especially a man whose focus seems to be on ONE thing (baseball), rather than people and what makes them tick.  Jane likes her life just the way it is right now, and wants no complications, thank you very much!  Ms. Preston's acting ability is tested over and over again as Chapel swings in and out of her life.  Both Billy and Jane wish very much not to ask or answer the question: &quot;Now tell me about YOU&quot;.  A breach is made in this relationship wall by a very sneaky tactic: a very personable, extremely confused and angry teen-ager, Heather Aubrey (Jena Malone), Jane's daughter.  We finally get a peek at what we need to know to make this more than just a &quot;chic flick&quot; or &quot;guys game&quot;.  Check it out for yourself.  The baseball side of the balance scale is fleshed out by rabid, in-your-face Yankee fans, and a baseball announcer whose remarks, especially when things get tight, become prosaic enough you'd think a university English major had written them.  The relationship side is given depth by incidences which reveal why neither Jane nor Billy will risk answering the question &quot;WHO are YOU?&quot;  Adhering to the spirit and the letter of reviewers' agreement with Amazon.com, I can say no more, though I'm really itching to do so.  Maybe they'll let me put it this way: Recall Tom Cruise and Renee Zellweger in &quot;Jerry MaGuire&quot;.  Jerry's last words were: &quot;You...complete me&quot;.

This movie accurately captures what it is like to be on the field.  The voice overs are very close to what my friend and myself said we  were thinking when we played in High School.  Your mind is every where.  Your ability to focus is key, which is shown very creatively cinematically in this movie.This movie also is a great story for Kevin Costner's Character.  Lots of flash backs based that give context and depth to his current problem make for a really interesting story.  The movie is certainly a drama with lots of romance interwoven.  It is hard to describe the story without revealing much.  Much of the movie is him pitching, while flashing back to memories of his life with a girlfriend.One thing that I loved, but also kind bother me was Vin Scully announcing.  As a Dodgers fan, there is NOTHING better than hearing Vin announce a game (Vin Scully is does the TV broadcast for the Dodgers alone and is an old-school, one man show).  He is a living legend and one of a kind.  The problem is he would never announce a Yankees Detroit Game, but is a perfect fit nonetheless for the role and type of movie this is.Overall, a great movie, especially considering most sports movies are awkward and clich&eacute;.

I've been pretty disappointed with Costner movies of late so I didn't rush out to catch this movie.  I would hardly consider this movie one of his best, but it didn't turn out to be so bad.In the end, I actually liked this movie.  This is the story of Billy Chapel who is pitching what could be his last game after a stunning 19 year career as a Detroit Tiger pitcher.  As he gives it his all, he has flashbacks of the events that have happened in the previous five years of his life and realizing that he hasn't given every aspect of his life the same effort he has given this game.In the end, the viewer will identify and care for Billy Chapel and the people in his life including his on-again, off-again girlfriend named Jane (played by Kelly Preston), Jane's daughter Heather, his loyal friend and catcher Gus (played wonderfully by John C. Riley), and many others.  This is a heart-felt drama and not so much the sport movie I thought it would be.The acting and story are quite superb.  There is even some sprinkling of humor that had me laughing out loud (""Have you ever had your heart broken?""  ""Yes, we lost a pennant race."")  My only complaint is that, at over 2 hours, this movie just gets to be too long.  Forty minutes before the end of the movie I just wanted it to come to its conclusion.

Munson,"[15, 17]","Following the shining examples of earlier characters in &quot;Bull Durham&quot; and &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, Kevin Costner has once again taken on the role of a baseball player and played it to perfection.  In this film, Costner stars as Detroit Tigers ace pitcher Billy Chapel, a 19-year veteran of the major leagues.  Chapel's hall of fame career is winding down, and his team is playing out the string of another long season.  To make matters worse, Jane, Billy's girlfriend, played superbly by Kelly Preston, has informed him that she has accepted a job offer in London.  The final bit of bad news comes from the Tigers' owner, who informs Billy that he's sold the team and Billy will probably be traded next season.  All of these things are weighing on Billy's mind as he steps on the mound at Yankee Stadium.However, right from the beginning of the game, Billy realizes that this day is going to be special.  He has his best stuff working, and he's blowing through the Yankees like they were little leaguers. Gus, the catcher played wonderfully by J.C. Reilly, offers continuous encouragement to Billy throughout the game. One of the best moments of the film is the way Billy blocks out the noise of the crowd in his mind, and all that the viewer hears is the wooosh of the ball as it is pitched.  I got chills when this occurred.  It was extermely realistic.During the course of the game, Billy has &quot;flashbacks&quot; to his relationship with Jane.  We get to see how they met and the evolution of their romance.  Although he hides it well, it is clear that Billy truly loves Jane, but he's afraid to admit to her that he really needs her in his life.  I thought the flashbacks were excellent.  In some films, the flashbacks tend to take away from the movie, but not in this one.  I think they were one of the better aspects of the movie.By the time the game reaches the 7th inning, Billy asks Gus if any Yankee has reached base.  Gus says no.  Only then does Billy realize that he's in the midst of a pitcher's dream; the perfect game.  Summoning incredible courage and strength, Billy manages to complete the ultimate baseball feat.Watching this movie was a real treat for me.  I enjoyed Costner's earlier performance in &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, but he tops it with this amazing performance.  I recommend this excellent movie to all baseball fans, and fans of good movies in general.

I have Bull Durham, and like it the more I see it, great humor in that movie, but For Love of the Game is the best ever. It has almost made me a baseball fan. Kevin Costner does an outstanding job in this movie--he throws all the pitches and makes the catches himself--that alone is amazing to watch, to hear the wind whistle past the ball, see the rosen powder fly from the catcher's mitt--it doesn't get any better.  The camera work is outstanding, camera angles/replays/closeups, overall film techniques used to produce realism of an actual professional game, actual umpires from the league in the role of umpires, actors with experience in minor and major league play in the role of players and coaches, fan/crowd responses, etc., it's as real as it can get.John C. Reilly is outstanding, he portrays the essence of a real friend. Kelly Preston is good, if I had a choice I would have chosen someone with more electricity and spark with Kevin but Costner makes up for the lack of spontaneous chemistry between the two. I would have bought this movie just to see the outstanding job Costner does, however, the story line is powerful; the relationship between Billy (Kevin) and Jane (Kelly)is so real depicting the ups and downs of a relationship with two flawed people and the difficutly of having a normal life and developing love interest with someone in the public eye. It just doesn't get any better, in my opinion, than For Love of the Game.The story in For Love of the Game is the story of life--only told from the perspective of a single baseball game.  We focus on one aspect of our life--our career--and almost ride it too long and risk missing out on the most important part of our overall existence. There are flaws in this movie but only those looking for flaws can get sidetracked by that and miss one of the best movies ever.  This one is a keeper and one to be watched over and over.  I don't know which I like best, the love story or the shots of the baseball game--and this from someone who doesn't like baseball--both are intertwined so skillfully they can't be separated.

68393,A16EZ4MT9BFF2R,078324021X,Mike Murray,"[0, 0]","The framework is a major league baseball game. The memories are those of an aging pitcher, Billy Chapel, whose day is not going well at all. His team, the Detroit Tigers are out of the pennant race and expected to lie down like a dog at the behest of the New York Yankees. Moreover, the team has been sold and Chapel is expected to be traded to San Francisco when the sale is announced. His lover, Jane Aubrey, has told him that she &quot;can't do this anymore&quot; and she's headed to London and out of his life. As his catcher, Gus Osinski, told him, it's just not his day.We're often told that baseball is like life; it meanders and goes along paths we may not expect. And so it is with Billy Chapel, who is pitching his heart out while he relives his life, especially after a chance meeting with Aubrey on a bridge over the Harlem River. Her car has broken down and Chapel stops, ostensibly to help her fix it. Jane, being the cynical New Yorker she is, waves Billy off, but he's intrigued and he prevails on Jane to let him take a look under her hood. Aubrey gets behind the wheel, turns the key; nothing happens. Chapel reaches in, jiggles a wire or two and, to his fortune, the car starts. Jane is pleased and thanks Billy who admits he didn't really do anything. Of course, in a typical New York moment, the tow truck shows up and the operator more or less demands that Aubrey let her car be towed. Chapel uses the opportunity to invite her to a game he's pitching and dinner afterwards.Now, it might be thought that Billy Chapel is setting himself up for a groupie situation. After a night of passionate sex, that's exactly what Aubrey thinks as well and she wants no part of it. What follows is a recounting of how Billy and Jane come together and fall apart more than once.This is an excellent baseball movie, with wonderful dramatic stretches and also lots of humor. Kevin Costner, who's done a baseball movie or two in his career, is totally believable as Billy Chapel, a character who seem somewhat modeled after Steve Carlton in that he only wants to pitch to his longtime battery-mate, Osinski (John C. Reilly). Osinski knows Chapel's abilities well and he needles and cajoles Chapel to get the most out of him, not only on the diamond, but in life as well. Vin Scully and Steve Lyons of Fox Sports appear as themselves doing the play-by-play of the game we see unfolding before our eyes. Scully's dialogue sounds as if it sprang right from his mouth, the way he normally speaks. I'd be interested in whether his dialogue was written (most likely) or ad lib.If there's a disappointment among the entire production, it is the performance of Kelly Preston as Jane Aubrey. Aubrey, we discover along the way, has a past which would seem to explain her on-again / off-again relationship with Chapel. Not all of this is Preston's fault; some of it has to belong to screenwriter Dana Stevens who adapted a novel by Michael Shaara. The baseball scenario is near-perfection, but the treatment of the romance leaves something to be desired. Regardless, Sam Raimi's near-flawless direction of material we don't normally see him do, makes the entire film one to enjoy. It has excellent comic timing, yet marvelous dramatic sequence both surrounding the game and external to it. Basil Poledouris' original score heightened the drama and never detracted from the film.If you like baseball, you'll love this movie. Costner, who co-produced, must bring something extra to movies about baseball because of his love of the game. This film is one of those that truly has something for everyone and almost completely pulls it off.

68395,A2Z9FXHC1L66EW,078324021X,"Mr. ""alan5973""","[2, 3]","This Baseball Trilogy started in 1988, beginning with Bull Durham, with Costner playing Crash Davis, a down on his luck catcher who must play  behind the new young pitcher, &quot;Nuke&quot; LaLoosh(Tim Robbins)while  falling for the lovely Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon).  Field Of Dreams  continued the trilogy with Costner, this time, playing Iowa farmer, Ray  Kinsella, who one day begins hearing voices in his cornfield, telling him  that if he builds a baseball field, the legendary Shoeless Joe Jackson  would come to play there.  And finally, Mr. Costner completes his baseball  trilogy with For Love Of The Game, a baseball/love story with Costner  playing Billy Chapel, a renowned and revered baseball pitcher for the  Detroit Tigers who's last game and season of his career is coming to an  end.  As we watch this game we are introduced thru flashbacks, Chapel's  past and what leads him to where he is now.  The baseball sequences are  flawless, looking just like the kind of game you'd watch on regular TV.  As  good a baseball player as Billy Chapel is, we find he is a very flawed man,  especially when it comes to finding the right person to share his personal  life with.  Enter Jane (Kelly Preston) who he meets on the side of the road  one day while she's kicking her car for breaking down.  The two decide to  meet each other whenever he's in town for a game, with no other strings  attached.  Of course things grow into more than this, especially when Jane  calls Billy to help her find her daughter who has run away from home.  As  you watch the game and in-between, view the flashbacks, you get a well  rounded character who, in his own right, is trying to do the right thing.  No one is to blame like most conventional romances, because both people  have legitimate reasons for acting the way that they do.  This is about a  man, who, at the end of his career, realizes that as important as baseball  means to him, life is very lonely if there is no one there to love and care  about the person inside.  This film has been widely criticized as being a  rip-off of Bull Durham.  But I like to look at it as Part 3 of a trilogy,  like Star Wars for example.  The first film wowed us, especially with  scenes of the players talking on the field that we wouldn't be able to hear  in real life.  The second film tugged at our hearts and our emotions for  our love of baseball itself.  And the third film sort of brings those two  pieces together (Return OF The Jedi has been said to just be a revamp of  Star Wars: A New Hope but we still love it).  If you look at it in this  manner, this film is a well made, well thought out piece of film making,  ingeniously directed by Mr. Sam Raimi. (Evil Dead 1, 2 and 3, A Simple  Plan) Included on the DVD is a Spotlight On Location featurette, giving us  some more insight on the making of the film as well as creating the  characters.  Deleted scenes, including one, used in the film, but here  showing the original profanity used by Kelly Preston.  The History Of The  Perfect Game is a nice read if you've got the time, giving background to  that most cherished game for a pitcher, plus a trivia game and the original  theatrical trailer.  While some people may still scoff, For Love Of The  Game delivers to those who still believe in the power of baseball and love.",4,Mr. Costner Completes His Baseball Trilogy!,966124800,"08 13, 2000",2000,3330,"['Baseball', 'Trilogy', 'started', '1988', 'beginning', 'Bull', 'Durham', 'Costner', 'playing', 'Crash', 'Davis', 'down', 'luck', 'catcher', 'who', 'must', 'play', 'new', 'young', 'pitcher', 'quot', 'Nuke', 'quot', 'LaLoosh', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'falling', 'lovely', 'Annie', 'Savoy', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'continued', 'trilogy', 'Costner', 'time', 'playing', 'Iowa', 'farmer', 'Ray', 'Kinsella', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'hearing', 'voices', 'cornfield', 'telling', 'baseball', 'field', 'legendary', 'Shoeless', 'Joe', 'Jackson', 'would', 'come', 'play', 'there', 'finally', 'Mr.', 'Costner', 'baseball', 'trilogy', 'Love', 'Game', 'baseball/love', 'story', 'Costner', 'playing', 'Billy', 'Chapel', 'renowned', 'revered', 'baseball', 'pitcher', 'Detroit', 'Tigers', 'who', 'last', 'game', 'season', 'career', 'coming', 'end', 'watch', 'game', 'are', 'introduced', 'thru', 'flashbacks', 'Chapel', 'past', 'what', 'where', 'now', 'baseball', 'sequences', 'are', 'flawless', 'looking', 'just', 'kind', 'game', ""'d"", 'watch', 'regular', 'TV', 'good', 'baseball', 'player', 'Billy', 'Chapel', 'find', 'very', 'flawed', 'man', 'especially', 'when', 'finding', 'right', 'person', 'share', 'personal', 'life', 'Enter', 'Jane', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'who', 'side', 'road', 'one', 'day', 'kicking', 'car', 'breaking', 'down', 'two', 'decide', 'meet', 'other', 'whenever', 'town', 'game', 'other', 'strings', 'attached', 'course', 'things', 'grow', 'more', 'especially', 'when', 'Jane', 'Billy', 'help', 'find', 'daughter', 'who', 'run', 'away', 'home', 'watch', 'game', 'in-between', 'view', 'flashbacks', 'get', 'well', 'rounded', 'character', 'who', 'own', 'right', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'one', 'blame', 'most', 'conventional', 'romances', 'people', 'have', 'legitimate', 'reasons', 'acting', 'way', 'do', 'man', 'who', 'end', 'career', 'as', 'important', 'baseball', 'life', 'very', 'lonely', 'one', 'there', 'love', 'care', 'person', 'inside', 'film', 'been', 'widely', 'criticized', 'being', 'rip-off', 'Bull', 'Durham', 'like', 'look', 'Part', '3', 'trilogy', 'Star', 'Wars', 'example', 'first', 'film', 'wowed', 'especially', 'scenes', 'players', 'talking', 'field', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'hear', 'real', 'life', 'second', 'film', 'tugged', 'hearts', 'emotions', 'love', 'baseball', 'third', 'film', 'sort', 'brings', 'two', 'pieces', 'together', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'been', 'said', 'just', 'be', 'revamp', 'Star', 'Wars', 'New', 'Hope', 'still', 'love', 'look', 'manner', 'film', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'piece', 'film', 'making', 'ingeniously', 'directed', 'Mr.', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Evil', 'Dead', '1', '2', '3', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'Included', 'DVD', 'Spotlight', 'Location', 'featurette', 'giving', 'more', 'insight', 'making', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'creating', 'characters', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'including', 'one', 'used', 'film', 'here', 'showing', 'original', 'profanity', 'used', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'History', 'Perfect', 'Game', 'nice', 'read', ""'ve"", 'got', 'time', 'giving', 'background', 'most', 'cherished', 'game', 'pitcher', 'trivia', 'game', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'people', 'may', 'still', 'scoff', 'Love', 'Game', 'delivers', 'who', 'still', 'believe', 'power', 'baseball', 'love']",N/A

68410,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,078324021X,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 4]","Getting ready to watch a Kevin Costner movie is like preparing for a siege: one needs to stock up on a hefty assortment of supplies because, if there is one thing we can be sure of, it's that we are in for a very long  haul. Actually, as Costner movies go, this 138-minute film is relatively  short - though its glacial pacing makes it seem eternal anyway. For sheer,  unadulterated tedium, this movie is, at the very least, a match for  Costner's previous romantic opus, &quot;Message in a  Bottle.&quot;Directed, shockingly, by the normally astute and insightful  Sam Raimi ( a bizarre capitulation on his part to slick, empty commercial  moviemaking), &quot;For Love of the Game&quot; seems like a film caught in  a movie genre limbo. Half reverential baseball movie and half sappy  romance, it seems catered to satisfy two widely disparate audiences that  wouldn't be caught dead standing in the same line at the local cineplex.  Perhaps, this is a pitch to come up with the perfect date movie (though  &quot;Titanic&quot; beat them to it - romance and Leonardo Di Caprio for  the ladies, sinking ship and mass death for the boys).Costner, in  another of his near-catatonic performances, portrays Billy Chapel, a  40-year old, soon to be over-the-hill pitcher for the Detroit Tigers who,  in a single day, learns that his team has been sold, he is about to be  traded to the Giants and his girlfriend of five years is leaving right that  very moment to start a new career in London. This set-up might have  resulted in an incisive study of a man caught in an age-limited career  learning to cope with the inevitable trauma of saying farewell and moving  on. Instead, the writers settle for a stale movie romance, with Chapel  standing on the mound, pitching his final game and flashing back like mad  to the happier days of ballfield triumphs and blossoming true love. The  film is ostensibly concerned with Chapel's success on the diamond but he  soon learns that even pitching a historical no-hitter and being carried  around in triumph on the shoulders of adoring team members and diehard  admirers is mere ashes without that one true love to share it with. The  screenplay, in fact, is so heavily weighted in the direction of the affair  he is having with Jane (Kelly Preston) that baseball fans are sure to feel  slighted - until the very end.Even in the ballpark, though, the film is  a failure. Why do so many movies, including this one, treat baseball as  some sort of holy rite, some sacred mission replete with corny imagery,  nauseating pep talks and cliched, slow motion views of tear-soaked faces  amid the euphoric masses? The detrimental effect of &quot;Field of  Dreams&quot; cannot be overestimated. Just once couldn't we see a film that  treats the sport for what it is - a fun pastime, completely devoid of  sentimentality?I will say one thing for this movie though: in  comparison to itself, it does make baseball look like a fastpaced sport!",2,romantic slop completely without edge,964483200,"07 25, 2000",2000,2966,"['Getting', 'ready', 'watch', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'movie', 'preparing', 'siege', 'one', 'stock', 'up', 'hefty', 'assortment', 'supplies', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'very', 'long', 'haul', 'Actually', 'Costner', 'movies', 'go', '138-minute', 'film', 'relatively', 'short', 'glacial', 'pacing', 'seem', 'eternal', 'anyway', 'sheer', 'unadulterated', 'tedium', 'movie', 'very', 'least', 'match', 'Costner', 'previous', 'romantic', 'opus', 'quot', 'Message', 'Bottle.', 'quot', 'Directed', 'shockingly', 'normally', 'astute', 'insightful', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'bizarre', 'capitulation', 'part', 'slick', 'empty', 'commercial', 'moviemaking', 'quot', 'Love', 'Game', 'quot', 'film', 'caught', 'movie', 'genre', 'limbo', 'Half', 'reverential', 'baseball', 'movie', 'half', 'sappy', 'romance', 'catered', 'satisfy', 'two', 'widely', 'disparate', 'audiences', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'caught', 'dead', 'standing', 'same', 'line', 'local', 'cineplex', 'Perhaps', 'pitch', 'come', 'up', 'perfect', 'date', 'movie', 'quot', 'Titanic', 'quot', 'beat', 'romance', 'Leonardo', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'ladies', 'sinking', 'ship', 'mass', 'death', 'boys', '.Costner', 'near-catatonic', 'performances', 'portrays', 'Billy', 'Chapel', '40-year', 'old', 'soon', 'be', 'over-the-hill', 'pitcher', 'Detroit', 'Tigers', 'who', 'single', 'day', 'team', 'been', 'sold', 'be', 'traded', 'Giants', 'girlfriend', 'five', 'years', 'leaving', 'right', 'very', 'moment', 'start', 'new', 'career', 'London', 'set-up', 'might', 'have', 'resulted', 'incisive', 'study', 'man', 'caught', 'age-limited', 'career', 'learning', 'cope', 'inevitable', 'trauma', 'saying', 'farewell', 'moving', 'Instead', 'writers', 'settle', 'stale', 'movie', 'romance', 'Chapel', 'standing', 'mound', 'pitching', 'final', 'game', 'flashing', 'back', 'mad', 'happier', 'days', 'ballfield', 'triumphs', 'blossoming', 'true', 'love', 'film', 'ostensibly', 'concerned', 'Chapel', 'success', 'diamond', 'soon', 'even', 'pitching', 'historical', 'no-hitter', 'being', 'carried', 'triumph', 'shoulders', 'adoring', 'team', 'members', 'diehard', 'admirers', 'mere', 'ashes', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'share', 'screenplay', 'fact', 'so', 'heavily', 'weighted', 'direction', 'affair', 'having', 'Jane', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'baseball', 'fans', 'are', 'sure', 'feel', 'slighted', 'very', 'end.Even', 'ballpark', 'though', 'film', 'failure', 'Why', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'including', 'one', 'treat', 'baseball', 'sort', 'holy', 'rite', 'sacred', 'mission', 'replete', 'corny', 'imagery', 'nauseating', 'pep', 'talks', 'cliched', 'slow', 'motion', 'views', 'tear-soaked', 'euphoric', 'masses', 'detrimental', 'effect', 'quot', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'quot', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'overestimated', 'Just', 'once', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'sport', 'what', 'fun', 'pastime', 'completely', 'devoid', 'sentimentality', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'comparison', 'make', 'baseball', 'look', 'fastpaced', 'sport']",N/A

68412,AOSQ5JIA2X4M,078324021X,"""rrr338""","[1, 2]","Billy Chapel (Costner), pitching what will be his last game, is so dominating in fact, that NOTHING gets to first base -- not even the romance.  That's the curious split-quality about this film.  It offers very  realistic and exciting baseball scenes, while at the same time plodingly  developing a romantic story-line through the vehicle of flashbacks while  Chapel succeeds on the mound.  An interesting cinematic twist, for sure.  Nevertheless, it fails because the romance, like a bunt foul, just doesn't  get the pulse going.Billy's flashbacks seem all-too intentionally  fashioned to cram in every cliche of the romance genre.  Jane is the cute  career-minded woman, but is ever-so reluctant to acknowledge any interest  in commitment.  She vacilates like crazy, then takes a chance and visits  Billy at spring training, unannounced.  You guessed it, she stumbles in on  him just as the &quot;other girl&quot;  (in obligatory briefs) appears on  the staircase and asks about the hair dryer.  Likewise, he stumbles in on  one of her writing assignments to find... (well you know already). There is  the &quot;surprise daughter&quot; from a previous relationship, which by  this time the audience fully expects.  And then there's Billy's soulfully  staring into Jane's apartment window (in the rain, no less) as he sees her  dim figure move towards the &quot;other guy.&quot;Okay, enough.  Let's  just get back to the drama of the baseball game.  This is done, mercifully,  at varioius junctures in the plot. One wonders how much more powerful a  film like this might have been if, say, Billy started the game havig to  make a momentous decision on the relationship. The flashbacks might then  have explored alternative scenarios, leaving the audience guessing until  the &quot;real&quot; decision (and outcome) is revealed at the conclusion  of the perfect game. That would have been  more like baseball -- running  the alternatives over and over in one's mind.Unfortunately, the movie  just drags on with the worn out &quot;I want her, I hope she wants me  enough to come back&quot; theme.  Maybe this is sufficient drama for a high  school kid &quot;in love,&quot; but it really strikes out with the more  knowledgable fans of love and the game.",3,A Dominating Performance...,957312000,"05 3, 2000",2000,2252,"['Billy', 'Chapel', 'Costner', 'pitching', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'game', 'so', 'dominating', 'fact', 'NOTHING', 'first', 'base', 'not', 'even', 'romance', 'curious', 'split-quality', 'film', 'very', 'realistic', 'exciting', 'baseball', 'scenes', 'same', 'time', 'plodingly', 'developing', 'romantic', 'story-line', 'vehicle', 'flashbacks', 'Chapel', 'mound', 'interesting', 'cinematic', 'twist', 'sure', 'Nevertheless', 'romance', 'bunt', 'foul', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'pulse', 'going.Billy', 'flashbacks', 'seem', 'all-too', 'intentionally', 'fashioned', 'cram', 'cliche', 'romance', 'genre', 'Jane', 'cute', 'career-minded', 'woman', 'ever-so', 'reluctant', 'acknowledge', 'interest', 'commitment', 'crazy', 'then', 'chance', 'visits', 'Billy', 'spring', 'training', 'unannounced', 'guessed', 'just', 'quot', 'other', 'girl', 'quot', 'obligatory', 'briefs', 'staircase', 'hair', 'dryer', 'Likewise', 'one', 'writing', 'assignments', 'find', 'well', 'know', 'already', 'quot', 'daughter', 'quot', 'previous', 'relationship', 'time', 'audience', 'fully', 'then', 'Billy', 'soulfully', 'staring', 'Jane', 'apartment', 'window', 'rain', 'less', 'dim', 'figure', 'move', 'quot', 'other', 'guy.', 'quot', 'Okay', 'enough', 'Let', 'just', 'get', 'back', 'drama', 'baseball', 'game', 'done', 'mercifully', 'varioius', 'junctures', 'plot', 'One', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'say', 'Billy', 'started', 'game', 'havig', 'make', 'momentous', 'decision', 'relationship', 'flashbacks', 'might', 'then', 'have', 'explored', 'alternative', 'scenarios', 'leaving', 'audience', 'guessing', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'decision', 'outcome', 'revealed', 'conclusion', 'perfect', 'game', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'baseball', 'running', 'alternatives', 'one', 'mind.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'just', 'drags', 'worn', 'out', 'quot', 'want', 'hope', 'enough', 'come', 'back', 'quot', 'theme', 'Maybe', 'sufficient', 'drama', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'quot', 'love', 'quot', 'really', 'out', 'more', 'knowledgable', 'fans', 'love', 'game']",N/A

That is very difficult to do when it is all you've known and loved. Facing just being a regular guy and not part of the Game and his fame is really hard to accept. Ladies: You will begin to understand him and certainly relate to her. Having someone else in your life can help ease the pain of making the decision he faces, (Kelly Preston would certainly help me, if I was him of course). When he finally realizes how special she is in his life, leaving the Game becomes a simple decision. Very good story. Very good acting.

Billy is at a crossroads both personally and professionally.  And by the next morning he has both figured out.While not a pure baseball movie it does offer a glimpse of what could be going on inside the head of a pitcher who is ""in the zone"" during the best game of his storied career.  He is throwing a perfect game but does not even realize it until around the sixth inning when he has to ask his catcher.  He does not realize it because his mind is elsewhere, on Jane (Kelly Preston) his on and off girlfriend of the last five years who has just told him she is going to live on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.  She dropped this bomb only ten minutes after his boss, the owner of the Tigers, told him that the club is being sold and he will be traded to another team the next year.  What a morning it started off as.  Throughout the game while he is throwing bullets he is trying to figure out what to do about Jane and about his career.Kelly Preston does a fine job as Jane and Jena Malone plays Jane's daughter, Heather with another good performance (although a much smaller part than some she has had).Overall a good movie for guys and gals to watch together.  The girls will like the love story, the guys will like the baseball and the memories of how it connected them (as it does Billy) to their fathers and the sandlot games of their youth.

Old-fashioned, straight-ahead storytelling, complimented  by solid performances, extremely  convincing on-the-field action, excellent  photography and more than competent direction by Sam Raimi, make for a  resoundingly entertaining movie...even if you're not much of a baseball  fan.Perhaps the best thing going for the film is its truly innovative  integration and balance of rapid-fire on-going game vs.  relationship  development flashback elements, allowing the viewer to &quot;get inside the  athlete's head&quot; in a way no other movie in recent memory  does.&quot;For Love&quot; thusly manages to put a signature spin on the  subjective experience of a great athlete's swan song by sharing &amp;  highlighting the stark contrast between the external precision &amp;  perfection of the real-world game in progress, and the turbulent, highly  personal, inner-world of the passions that drive him.Kevin Costner,  certainly NOT the greatest actor in the world, literally shines in the  mother of all tailor made roles. Kelly Preston shows us a highly focused  intensity, in just what may be her best on screen appearance to date! John  C. Reilly, although cast as the  solid-as-a-rock-always-there-when-you-need-him-on-the-sidelines Catcher,  plays to the hilt a supporting role, in every sense of the word.There  are moments in &quot;For Love&quot;, however, that seem a touch too  maudlin, trying just a little too hard to jerk that extra tear. A few of  these melancoly scenes are drawn out to the point of making the viewer  self-conscious and put upon. These occasional excesses are easily  overlooked, however, in light of the films many strengths and its overal  highly engrossing nature.TECHNICAL NOTE: Amazon rated picture quality of  the Widescreen DVD version a lackluster 3.5...which leads me to imagine  that either they reviewed a defective copy, or that there were problems  with early prints that were subsequently corrected, because the picture  quality I observed was among the best of my entire DVD collection !",4,"A GAMELY CRAFTED, NO-FRILLS HIT!",969408000,"09 20, 2000",2000,2194,"['quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', ""'em"", 'used', 'quot', 'regards', 'quot', 'Love', 'Game', 'quot', 'above', 'comment', 'applies', 'movies', 'baseball', 'players', 'Old-fashioned', 'straight-ahead', 'storytelling', 'complimented', 'solid', 'performances', 'extremely', 'convincing', 'on-the-field', 'action', 'excellent', 'photography', 'more', 'competent', 'direction', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'make', 'resoundingly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'much', 'baseball', 'best', 'thing', 'going', 'film', 'truly', 'innovative', 'integration', 'balance', 'rapid-fire', 'on-going', 'game', 'vs.', 'relationship', 'development', 'flashback', 'elements', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'quot', 'get', 'athlete', 'head', 'quot', 'way', 'other', 'movie', 'recent', 'memory', 'does.', 'quot', 'Love', 'quot', 'thusly', 'put', 'signature', 'spin', 'subjective', 'experience', 'great', 'athlete', 'swan', 'song', 'sharing', 'amp', 'highlighting', 'stark', 'contrast', 'external', 'precision', 'amp', 'perfection', 'real-world', 'game', 'progress', 'turbulent', 'highly', 'personal', 'inner-world', 'passions', 'drive', 'him.Kevin', 'Costner', 'certainly', 'NOT', 'greatest', 'actor', 'world', 'literally', 'shines', 'mother', 'tailor', 'made', 'roles', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'highly', 'focused', 'intensity', 'just', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'screen', 'appearance', 'date', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'cast', 'solid-as-a-rock-always-there-when-you-need-him-on-the-sidelines', 'Catcher', 'hilt', 'supporting', 'role', 'sense', 'are', 'moments', 'quot', 'Love', 'quot', 'however', 'seem', 'touch', 'too', 'maudlin', 'trying', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'jerk', 'extra', 'tear', 'few', 'melancoly', 'scenes', 'are', 'drawn', 'point', 'making', 'viewer', 'self-conscious', 'put', 'upon', 'occasional', 'excesses', 'are', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'however', 'light', 'films', 'many', 'strengths', 'overal', 'highly', 'engrossing', 'nature.TECHNICAL', 'NOTE', 'Amazon', 'rated', 'picture', 'quality', 'Widescreen', 'DVD', 'version', 'lackluster', '3.5', 'imagine', 'reviewed', 'defective', 'copy', 'were', 'problems', 'early', 'prints', 'were', 'subsequently', 'corrected', 'picture', 'quality', 'observed', 'was', 'best', 'entire', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

Bull Durham is the comedy, Field of Dreams is the spiritual, but For Love of the Game is the more realistic of the bunch.Billy Chapel (Costner) is an aging veteran pitcher for a bad Detroit team in the twilight of his career who must decide on retirement, or accepting a trade.  The movie takes place over the course of just 1 game, with back flashes of his relationship with Jane (Kelly Preston).The movie touches on the celebrity of athletes, and the difficulties of having a normal relationship.  I personally thought that the underlying theme was about choosing between a career or a relationship, but I'm sure it was probably deeper than that.I have always thought that Costner was a bit of a ham who takes himself way too seriously, and while at times in this movie he tends to fall into that role,  Billy Chapel is more of an understated character, and Costner is by far at his best when he plays that kind of role.",5,Kevin Baseball,1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,1004,"['Costner', 'made', '5', '6', 'good', 'movies', 'three', 'are', 'baseball', 'Bull', 'Durham', 'comedy', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'spiritual', 'Love', 'Game', 'more', 'realistic', 'bunch.Billy', 'Chapel', 'Costner', 'aging', 'veteran', 'pitcher', 'bad', 'Detroit', 'team', 'twilight', 'career', 'who', 'must', 'decide', 'retirement', 'accepting', 'trade', 'movie', 'place', 'course', 'just', '1', 'game', 'back', 'flashes', 'relationship', 'Jane', 'Kelly', 'Preston', '.The', 'movie', 'touches', 'celebrity', 'athletes', 'difficulties', 'having', 'normal', 'relationship', 'personally', 'thought', 'underlying', 'theme', 'was', 'choosing', 'career', 'relationship', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'probably', 'deeper', 'that.I', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'Costner', 'was', 'bit', 'ham', 'who', 'way', 'too', 'seriously', 'times', 'movie', 'fall', 'role', 'Billy', 'Chapel', 'more', 'understated', 'character', 'Costner', 'far', 'best', 'when', 'kind', 'role']",N/A

68424,AP3B615GM191G,078324021X,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 2]","Considering the fact that ""Field of Dreams"" (also starring Kevin Costner and about the national pastime) is my favorite sports film of all time, I watched this film with high expectations.  For the most part, this movie lived up to those expectations.Basically, the plot centers on Detroit Tigers pitcher Billy Chapel, who finds himself nearing the end of a very long and very successful career.  However, when the owner of the Tigers tells Billy that the team no longer can afford him, Billy must make the biggest decision of his life (be traded or retire), all the while putting up zeroes on the Yankee Stadium scoreboard on the final day of the baseball season.This aspect of the film (Billy's tumultuous decision) really works for baseball fans in a couple of ways.  First is the use of flashbacks (think LOST) that show Billy's career up until the present, including his long road back from injury and a burgeoning (yet complicated) romance.  Secondly, the vocal talents of Vin Scully (the real-life voice of the Dodgers) will remind all viewers that this movie truly is meant to appeal to pure baseball fans.  As Billy pitches deep into his remarkable game, all the while recollecting the earlier events of his life, the film's climax is superbly narrated by Scully.About the only ""knock"" I have on this film (and thus why it isn't five stars) stems from the fact that Billy's romantic issues tend to be a bit too contrived to create the highest form of believable drama.  Perhaps Costner was trying to portray a very conflicted Chapel, but to me it came off as a bit confusing how Billy could have his ""affairs on the side"" and still be involved in a touching romance.All told, though, this is a film that baseball fans will almost certainly love.  Even if you don't completely fall for the romantic aspects, you will be cheering on Billy Chapel as he struggles to achieve the pinnacle of baseball greatness for a pitcher.  Once again, as in ""Field of Dreams"", Costner proves that he truly does know how to capture the essence of what makes the game of baseball so dramatic.",4,"Kevin Costner Just ""Gets"" Baseball",1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,2081,"['Considering', 'fact', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'also', 'starring', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'national', 'pastime', 'favorite', 'sports', 'film', 'time', 'watched', 'film', 'high', 'expectations', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'lived', 'up', 'expectations.Basically', 'plot', 'centers', 'Detroit', 'Tigers', 'pitcher', 'Billy', 'Chapel', 'who', 'nearing', 'end', 'very', 'long', 'very', 'successful', 'career', 'However', 'when', 'owner', 'Tigers', 'Billy', 'team', 'no', 'longer', 'can', 'afford', 'Billy', 'must', 'make', 'biggest', 'decision', 'life', 'be', 'traded', 'retire', 'while', 'putting', 'up', 'zeroes', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', 'scoreboard', 'final', 'day', 'baseball', 'season.This', 'aspect', 'film', 'Billy', 'tumultuous', 'decision', 'really', 'baseball', 'fans', 'couple', 'ways', 'First', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'think', 'LOST', 'show', 'Billy', 'career', 'up', 'present', 'including', 'long', 'road', 'back', 'injury', 'burgeoning', 'yet', 'complicated', 'romance', 'Secondly', 'vocal', 'talents', 'Vin', 'Scully', 'real-life', 'voice', 'Dodgers', 'will', 'remind', 'viewers', 'movie', 'truly', 'meant', 'appeal', 'pure', 'baseball', 'fans', 'Billy', 'deep', 'remarkable', 'game', 'while', 'recollecting', 'earlier', 'events', 'life', 'film', 'climax', 'superbly', 'narrated', 'Scully.About', 'only', 'knock', 'have', 'film', 'thus', 'why', ""n't"", 'five', 'stars', 'fact', 'Billy', 'romantic', 'issues', 'tend', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'contrived', 'create', 'highest', 'form', 'believable', 'drama', 'Perhaps', 'Costner', 'was', 'trying', 'portray', 'very', 'conflicted', 'Chapel', 'came', 'off', 'bit', 'confusing', 'how', 'Billy', 'could', 'have', 'affairs', 'side', 'still', 'be', 'involved', 'touching', 'romance.All', 'told', 'though', 'film', 'baseball', 'fans', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'love', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'completely', 'fall', 'romantic', 'aspects', 'will', 'be', 'cheering', 'Billy', 'Chapel', 'achieve', 'pinnacle', 'baseball', 'greatness', 'pitcher', 'Once', 'again', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'Costner', 'truly', 'know', 'how', 'capture', 'essence', 'what', 'game', 'baseball', 'so', 'dramatic']",N/A
