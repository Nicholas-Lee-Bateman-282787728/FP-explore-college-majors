All along the way there were small twists and turns that kept surprising me.The story begins when elementary school teacher, Paul Maddens - who has a reason to be severely depressed by Christmas - is railroaded into directing the Nativity pageant by his school's Headmistress. The pageant is clearly destined for failure. That is, until a bizarre character named Mr. Poppy shows up as Mr. Maddens' new teacher's assistant. Poppy (who is actually the Headmistress' in-need-of-a-job nephew) serves as the catalyst for both the complications and the magic needed to turn the depressed school teacher's hopeless situation around.Martin Freeman's sincere and perfectly understated performance as the disheartened Paul Madden was great.

Little did I know that by the time it was over I would be captivated.When the contract ran out on Netflix I wanted to watch it again so badly that I bought it and I'm not sorry. Without giving away too much of the plot the story is basically an underdog type movie. The children are told to do a Nativity play for their school, a school not known for its excellence, shall we say, and Freeman's character is the teacher in charge. Enter Mr. Poppy, a child seemingly stuck in a man's body hilariously played by Marc Wooton. There is a romantic back story which added to the plot but didn't distract from the thrust of the story.One of the things that amazes me about this move and it's sequel, Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger (that I have yet to see) is that they are all improve.

Florio,"[3, 4]","This is a very good movie which starts off a bit questionably (primarily with the obvious comic relief character, the teacher's aid) but really develops into an enjoyable movie.  I've given this movie a solid three star rating because it is not a perfect five star movie.  The elaborate show at the end is fantastic but unrealistic given a school's resources and the characters don't have great development except for the lead.  But these are minor nitpicks in what was an extremely enjoyable movie.  Definitely recommended.  I do wish there was more than a Spanish subtitle (there's a cute blonde boy (who looks like a young Simon Pegg)) who just cracks me up but with the English accent, is hard to follow.  There's also no extras beyond a trailer for the movie.  But if you think a delightful English Christmas movie is right up your alley, then definitely check out this movie.
