885055,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0007OY2MG,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[59, 64]","I don't know what it is about the third seasons of my all time favorite television shows. Their third years always seem to be one of their best, if not THE best, season of the series. And this one is no exception. By this time, Gilmore Girls has grown to be one of the more accomplished, sophisticated, witty, clever, and intelligent pieces of work on television. I am constantly amazed with every episode with the magnitude of clever writing, humor, and top of the line acting. Amy Sherman-Palladino is a writer/director of immense talent, and I am still thrilled to this day that she has given us the wonderful gift of the girls. Season 3 is, in my opinion, the best season of the show yet. Filled with the colorful characters and stories that have cemented the series' reputation, season 3 delivers in all areas. Season 3 contains many of the show's top best episodes to date. The season starts off with ""Those Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days"", a sunny opener. Rory's college future is first taken on in the third episode, the hysterical ""Application Anxiety"". One of the best episodes is ""They Shoot Gilmores, Don't They?"", a dazzling episode that sees Lorelei and Rory participating in the town's dance-a-thon, but things go bad when the ongoing Dean/Jess rivalry comes to a head. Fantastic. ""Let The Games Begin"" is a hilarious elder Gilmore centered episode that puts Rory's future college plans into question. The holidays come into play with the wonderful ""A Deep Fried Korean Thanksgiving"", where the girls are invited to 4 different Thanksgiving dinners. Lorelei's backstory comes into play in the teriffic ""Dear Emily And Richard"", a flashback rich episode that shows a young Lorelei getting pregnant with Rory, and the rift between her and her parents when she goes into labor. Old beau Max Medina comes back into Lor's life in the unforgettable ""Keg! Max!"", which also has a slamming party that causes mayhem for Rory and Lane. The character of Jess caused a lot of great mayhem with other characters, but was always a one note, one sided character himself with no real story for being the way he is. He was on book smart level with Rory, but other than that, they didn't have anything in common and were wrong for each other. Jess' departure starts in ""Say Goodnight, Gracie"", when his dad shows up, and completely leaves in ""Here Comes The Son"", which was supposed to set up his own spin-off, which never happened. The season ends with one of the shows' greatest finales, ""Those Are Strings, Pinocchio"", which sees Rory graduate from Chilton. It was a monumental and classic episode to go out on. One of the best. There is plenty more to relish in these 22 episodes, and those are just the tip of the iceberg. Other great pleasures include ""The Big One"", which includes a hilarious after sex talk between Paris and Rory. ""One's Got Class & The Other One Dyes"" is classic Gilmore, and it has Lorelei sweating bullets when her past comes into question when giving a talk to a high school class about getting pregnant at 16. The cast continues to shine and show that they are one of the finest and tighest ensembles on television. It continues to be a crime that they, and the show itself, doesn't recogniting from the Emmy's. Lauren Graham becomes more and more amazing with each passing season, and she is definitley one of the best actresses, with one of the best characters, on TV at the moment. Alexis Bledel is still the best kid on the tube, and everyone else showcases what a fine ensemble cast should be. The writing is still some of the most amazing on television, and you really need to know your stuff and pop culture to know some of the things they are talking about. Season 3 of Gilmore Girls is top notch, quality television, and it makes you wish that all TV shows could be this good.",5,Third Time's The Charm,1110067200,"03 6, 2005",2005,3804,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'third', 'seasons', 'time', 'favorite', 'television', 'shows', 'third', 'years', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'THE', 'best', 'season', 'series', 'one', 'exception', 'time', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'grown', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'accomplished', 'sophisticated', 'witty', 'clever', 'intelligent', 'pieces', 'work', 'television', 'am', 'constantly', 'amazed', 'episode', 'magnitude', 'clever', 'writing', 'humor', 'top', 'line', 'acting', 'Amy', 'Sherman-Palladino', 'writer/director', 'immense', 'talent', 'am', 'still', 'thrilled', 'day', 'given', 'wonderful', 'gift', 'girls', 'Season', '3', 'opinion', 'best', 'season', 'show', 'yet', 'Filled', 'colorful', 'characters', 'stories', 'have', 'cemented', 'series', 'reputation', 'season', '3', 'delivers', 'areas', 'Season', '3', 'contains', 'many', 'show', 'top', 'best', 'episodes', 'date', 'season', 'off', 'Lazy', 'Hazy', 'Crazy', 'Days', 'sunny', 'opener', 'Rory', 'college', 'future', 'first', 'taken', 'third', 'episode', 'hysterical', 'Application', 'Anxiety', 'One', 'best', 'episodes', 'Shoot', 'Gilmores', 'Do', ""n't"", 'dazzling', 'episode', 'Lorelei', 'Rory', 'participating', 'town', 'dance-a-thon', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'when', 'ongoing', 'Dean/Jess', 'rivalry', 'head', 'Fantastic', 'Let', 'Games', 'Begin', 'hilarious', 'elder', 'Gilmore', 'centered', 'episode', 'Rory', 'future', 'college', 'plans', 'question', 'holidays', 'come', 'play', 'wonderful', 'A', 'Deep', 'Fried', 'Korean', 'Thanksgiving', 'where', 'girls', 'are', 'invited', '4', 'different', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinners', 'Lorelei', 'backstory', 'play', 'teriffic', 'Dear', 'Emily', 'Richard', 'flashback', 'rich', 'episode', 'young', 'Lorelei', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'Rory', 'rift', 'parents', 'when', 'labor', 'Old', 'beau', 'Max', 'Medina', 'back', 'Lor', 'life', 'unforgettable', 'Keg', 'Max', 'also', 'slamming', 'party', 'mayhem', 'Rory', 'Lane', 'character', 'Jess', 'caused', 'lot', 'great', 'mayhem', 'other', 'characters', 'was', 'always', 'one', 'note', 'one', 'sided', 'character', 'real', 'story', 'being', 'way', 'was', 'book', 'smart', 'level', 'Rory', 'other', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'common', 'were', 'wrong', 'other', 'Jess', 'departure', 'Say', 'Goodnight', 'Gracie', 'when', 'dad', 'up', 'completely', 'Here', 'Son', 'was', 'supposed', 'set', 'up', 'own', 'spin-off', 'never', 'happened', 'season', 'one', 'shows', 'greatest', 'finales', 'Are', 'Strings', 'Pinocchio', 'Rory', 'graduate', 'Chilton', 'was', 'monumental', 'classic', 'episode', 'go', 'out', 'One', 'best', 'plenty', 'more', 'relish', '22', 'episodes', 'are', 'just', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'Other', 'great', 'pleasures', 'include', 'Big', 'One', 'hilarious', 'sex', 'talk', 'Paris', 'Rory', 'One', 'Got', 'Class', 'Other', 'One', 'Dyes', 'classic', 'Gilmore', 'Lorelei', 'sweating', 'bullets', 'when', 'past', 'question', 'when', 'giving', 'talk', 'high', 'school', 'class', 'getting', 'pregnant', '16', 'cast', 'shine', 'show', 'are', 'one', 'finest', 'tighest', 'ensembles', 'television', 'be', 'crime', 'show', ""n't"", 'recogniting', 'Emmy', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'more', 'more', 'amazing', 'passing', 'season', 'definitley', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'one', 'best', 'characters', 'TV', 'moment', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', 'still', 'best', 'kid', 'tube', 'everyone', 'else', 'what', 'fine', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'should', 'be', 'writing', 'still', 'most', 'amazing', 'television', 'really', 'need', 'know', 'stuff', 'pop', 'culture', 'know', 'things', 'are', 'talking', 'Season', '3', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'top', 'notch', 'quality', 'television', 'wish', 'TV', 'shows', 'could', 'be', 'good']",Gilmore Girls: Season 3

885057,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0007OY2MG,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[2, 3]","Nominated for 1 Emmy and 1 Golden Globe in its first five seasons, Gilmore Girls has experienced much greater success among TV viewers than among industry critics. In fact, the show is the first script supported by the Family Friendly Forum's script development fund to go on and become a regular television series. Part of an initiative between The WB Network - maker of such hits as Dawson's Creek (1998), Felicity (1998), Angel (1999), and Smallville (2001) - and fellow industry executives, this push for more family-oriented programming resulted in a series showcasing a unique mother-daughter bond and the various people they encounter on their life voyage of discovery. Set in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, Gilmore Girls utilizes many of the same sets as the hit series The Dukes Of Hazzard (1979) - another successful Warner Brothers production from years past...Gilmore Girls is set in a small idyllic community in Connecticut filled with a wide range of diverse characters and eccentric personalities. Against this backdrop, Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) attempts to raise her daughter and best friend, Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), to carve out a better life for herself. Having made a number of youthful mistakes, Lorelai made the decision to raise her daughter by herself at a young age (the same age as Rory when the series begins), and she's bound and determined to make sure that Rory makes better decisions for herself. As Rory prepares to go off to college, she displays many of the same likes and dislikes as her mother - especially when it comes to the opposite sex, and that's what worries Lorelai the most... A borderline soap opera, Gilmore Girls is more of a serial drama that focuses on the love, friendship, and shared growth of a mother and daughter as they live out their dreams in modern day America...The Gilmore Girls (Season 3) DVD features a number of touching episodes including the season premiere ""Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days"" in which everyone's relationship is a source for debate. Rory and Lorelai discuss the merits of Jess versus Dean, while Lorelai's parents debate her relationship with Christopher. Meanwhile, Sookie and Jackson argue over the proper way to decorate their house... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""A Deep-Fried Korean Thanksgiving"" in which Lorelai and Rory eat four different Thanksgiving dinners (including a tofu turkey!), and ""Happy Birthday, Baby"" in which Lorelai's parents are ecstatic to learn of Rory's decision to attend Yale, but Emily is angry with Richard when Lorelai pays off their loan because she thinks it will mean the end of her relationship with Lorelai and Rory...Below is a list of episodes included on the Gilmore Girls (Season 3) DVD:Episode 44 (Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days)Episode 45 (Haunted Leg)Episode 46 (Application Anxiety)Episode 47 (One's Got Class and the Other One Dyes)Episode 48 (Eight O'Clock at the Oasis)Episode 49 (Take the Deviled Eggs...)Episode 50 (They Shoot Gilmore's, Don't They?)Episode 51 (Let the Games Begin)Episode 52 (A Deep-Fried Korean Thanksgiving)Episode 53 (That'll Do, Pig)Episode 54 (I Solemnly Swear)Episode 55 (Lorelai Out of Water)Episode 56 (Dear Emily and Richard)Episode 57 (Swan Song)Episode 58 (Face-Off)Episode 59 (The Big One)Episode 60 (A Tale of Poes and Fire)Episode 61 (Happy Birthday, Baby)Episode 62 (Keg!

Lorelei and Sookie (Melissa McCarthy) are forced to speed up their plans to open their own inn due to unforseen events at the Independence, though not without severe complications.  The most important arc of the season concerned Rory's senior year at Chilton and her choice of college.  The road to that decision is fraught with complications and wonderful character moments, and Rory's graduation is quite touching.  At first, I didn't care for the addition of Rory's new bad boy paramour Jess (Milo Ventimiglia), but he grew on me after a while.

They share a love for breathless quip-filled conversation and coffee, frequenting Luke's Diner in the downtown of Stars Hollow, their fictitious Connecticut suburb.In Season 1, 16-year-old Rory decides she wants to transfer from the public high school to Chilton, a ritzy private school in Hartford. To make it happen, Lorelai has to make the ultimate sacrifice -- beseech her parents Richard and Emily, with whom she hasn't been on good terms since she announced her teenage pregnancy. Although estranged with Lorelai, the elder Gilmores are more than eager to accept their young granddaughter into their lives. They agree to foot the bill -- on one condition. Both Lorelai and Rory must attend dinner at the elder Gilmores' home every Friday evening.Reluctantly, Lorelai agrees. The resulting Friday night dinners set the stage for much hilarity and snark -- as well as the occasional glimpse into the Gilmores' sad past, hinting at everything that went wrong in their relationship, well before Rory's birth.Also seen on the show are diner proprietor Luke, a quiet, loyal friend to both mother and daughter with a building crush on Lorelai; Lane, the Korean-American daughter of a stern single mother and Rory's best friend; Sookie, chef at the Independence Inn, which Lorelai manages; Kirk, a quirky ""townie"" who mysteriously shows up everywhere anyone's doing anything; dance instructor and romance expert Miss Patty; and many others. Rory's father Christopher is also around sporadically, as he and Lorelai fight an attraction which has intertwined throughout their lives, but never seems to work out.In this season, Rory fights an attraction to Luke's bad-boy nephew Jess...til things come to a point where she has to make a decision between him and Dean, her first serious boyfriend. She and her best friend Paris are also consumed with college applications, while Rory's stepmother Sherry gives birth to little Gigi.Although the show is supposedly set in Connecticut, the writers and producers never really make that believable to a native (i.e. Rory and Lorelai walking around with thin coats, wide open, supposedly in the middle of winter. Still, I can overlook that -- it's fun having one of my favorite shows set in my own state. That way, I almost feel like I might really bump into a Stars Hollow resident somewhere along my way... :-)",5,"Smart, funny...and set in Connecticut!",1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,2463,"['Having', 'literally', 'grown', 'up', 'together', '18-year-old', 'Rory', 'Gilmore', '34-year-old', 'mother', 'Lorelai', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'share', 'love', 'breathless', 'quip-filled', 'conversation', 'coffee', 'frequenting', 'Luke', 'Diner', 'downtown', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'fictitious', 'Connecticut', 'suburb.In', 'Season', '1', '16-year-old', 'Rory', 'transfer', 'public', 'high', 'school', 'Chilton', 'ritzy', 'private', 'school', 'Hartford', 'make', 'happen', 'Lorelai', 'make', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'parents', 'Richard', 'Emily', 'whom', ""n't"", 'been', 'good', 'terms', 'announced', 'teenage', 'pregnancy', 'estranged', 'Lorelai', 'elder', 'Gilmores', 'are', 'more', 'eager', 'accept', 'young', 'granddaughter', 'lives', 'agree', 'foot', 'bill', 'one', 'condition', 'Lorelai', 'Rory', 'must', 'attend', 'dinner', 'elder', 'Gilmores', 'home', 'Friday', 'evening.Reluctantly', 'Lorelai', 'resulting', 'Friday', 'night', 'dinners', 'set', 'stage', 'much', 'hilarity', 'snark', 'as', 'well', 'occasional', 'glimpse', 'Gilmores', 'sad', 'past', 'hinting', 'everything', 'went', 'wrong', 'relationship', 'well', 'Rory', 'birth.Also', 'seen', 'show', 'are', 'diner', 'proprietor', 'Luke', 'quiet', 'loyal', 'friend', 'mother', 'daughter', 'building', 'crush', 'Lorelai', 'Lane', 'Korean-American', 'daughter', 'stern', 'single', 'mother', 'Rory', 'best', 'friend', 'Sookie', 'chef', 'Independence', 'Inn', 'Lorelai', 'Kirk', 'quirky', 'townie', 'who', 'mysteriously', 'up', 'everywhere', 'anyone', 'doing', 'anything', 'dance', 'instructor', 'romance', 'expert', 'Miss', 'Patty', 'many', 'others', 'Rory', 'father', 'Christopher', 'also', 'around', 'sporadically', 'Lorelai', 'fight', 'attraction', 'intertwined', 'lives', 'never', 'work', 'out.In', 'season', 'Rory', 'attraction', 'Luke', 'bad-boy', 'nephew', 'Jess', 'til', 'things', 'come', 'point', 'where', 'make', 'decision', 'Dean', 'first', 'serious', 'boyfriend', 'best', 'friend', 'Paris', 'are', 'also', 'consumed', 'college', 'applications', 'Rory', 'stepmother', 'Sherry', 'birth', 'little', 'show', 'supposedly', 'set', 'Connecticut', 'writers', 'producers', 'never', 'really', 'make', 'believable', 'native', 'i.e', 'Rory', 'Lorelai', 'walking', 'around', 'thin', 'coats', 'wide', 'open', 'supposedly', 'middle', 'winter', 'Still', 'can', 'overlook', 'fun', 'having', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'set', 'own', 'state', 'way', 'almost', 'feel', 'might', 'really', 'bump', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'resident', 'somewhere', 'way']",Gilmore Girls: Season 3

885071,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0007OY2MG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[65, 70]","The third season of ""Gilmore Girls"" offers a lot of ups and down for Lorelai and Rory, not to mention pretty much everybody else at Stars Hollow or Chilton.  I was prepared to declare that this was my least favorite season of the series because I did not like Jess and I though Rory's choice to ditch Dean for Jess was the lost of the innocence that made the character so endearing in the first place.  Then I took into account that ""Gilmore Girls"" airs on the WB and from Felicity choosing Ben over Noel and Joey picking Pacey over Dawson I have been nothing but disappointed with the romantic choices of their ing&eacute;nues.  Buffy chose Angel and then she ended up killing him.  If Lorelai and Luke do not end up happily ever after I might be compelled to give up on the show (consider this fair warning, WB), but if Rory could dump Dean I knew Jess could never go the distance and I could take heart in that fact.What defines this third season for Lorelai and Rory are not the men (or boys) in their lives but rather their goals of realizing their dreams.  For Lorelai this means opening up her own inn with Sookie.  That dream gets put on the front burner when a fire damages the Independence Inn (""A Tale of Poes and Fire""), but buying the Dragonfly Inn (the house from ""The Waltons"" if you know your television history) proves to be a problem (""Say Goodnight, Gracie"").  When Lorelai insists on spending the money she got from her father on her daughter's education at Yale it is Rory who has to cut her own deal with Richard and Emily so that her mother can get her dream too (""Those Are Strings, Pinocchio"").  It is supposedly a ""win-win-win"" situation, but that remains to be seen.Of course, Rory getting into the college of her dreams is the real defining element of the season.  I came to the show late (mea culpa, mea maxima culpa) so I knew that Rory was at Yale and wondered what on earth had happened to keep her from going to Harvard.  Well, in Season 3 we find out.  The dream starts to turn into a nightmare when Rory's application for Harvard has to be put together (""Application Anxiety"").  When Paris did not get into Harvard (""The Big One""), I was terrified the same fate awaited Rory.  But when Richard manipulates Rory into an interview at Yale (""Let the Games Begin"") my biggest surprise was that Lorelai was actually wrong in an argument with her father (the end of the episode indicates she knows that too).  This one has two of Rory's best moments in this season are when she tells Richard he did the right thing the wrong way in this episode and when she apologizes to Dean and I could feel she was still a good kid at heart.  I also like it in the season finale when she tells Emily she is being stupid in shutting out Lorelai and if I could use my one free spin in this life to get Rory to say something it would be to tell Emily, ""Grandma, I love you, but no matter what you do I will never love you more than I love my mother.""The best part of Rory and Jess was Lorelai giving Luke lessons on what it means to be a parent of a teenager in love.  Other big moments are the dance marathon (""They Shoot Gilmores Don't They?""), the poignant flashback's to the pregnant young Lorelai (""Dear Emily and Richard""), and Emily standing up to Trix (""That'll Do, Pig"").  For me the funniest moment of the entire season is in ""I Solemnly Swear"" when Emily reads the transcript of Lorelai's deposition.  I almost busted a gut on that one.  Yes, I cried when Rory talked about her mom in her graduation speech, but the sweetest moment of the season was when they came up with the great payoff for the running gag about the t-shirts Kirk was selling at the end of ""A Tale of Poes and Fire"" (Admit it: You wish you have a ""Rory's Going to Yale"" t-shirt).  Now we can send Rory off to college in Season 4 so that Luke and Lorelai can finally get on the same page and kiss already.The DVD offers up extra scenes, which is certainly ample justification for fans of the show to check it out in this format.  Besides, if you have waiting to see baby pictures of Lauren Graham or Alexis Bledel, Liz Torres and Kelly Bishop in their dancing days, or having a burning desire to see Sean Gunn do the robot again, then the featurettes on the childhood stories from the cast and their best 1980s dance moves are going to allow you to move on to having other images on your visual wish list.",5,"The ""Gilmore Girls"" get to realize their dreams in Season 3",1115424000,"05 7, 2005",2005,4398,"['third', 'season', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'lot', 'ups', 'down', 'Lorelai', 'Rory', 'not', 'mention', 'pretty', 'much', 'everybody', 'else', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'Chilton', 'was', 'prepared', 'declare', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'season', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'Jess', 'though', 'Rory', 'choice', 'ditch', 'Dean', 'Jess', 'was', 'lost', 'innocence', 'made', 'character', 'so', 'endearing', 'first', 'place', 'Then', 'took', 'account', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'airs', 'WB', 'Felicity', 'choosing', 'Ben', 'Noel', 'Joey', 'picking', 'Pacey', 'Dawson', 'have', 'been', 'nothing', 'disappointed', 'romantic', 'choices', 'ing', 'eacute', 'nues', 'Buffy', 'chose', 'Angel', 'then', 'ended', 'up', 'killing', 'Lorelai', 'Luke', 'do', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'happily', 'ever', 'might', 'be', 'compelled', 'give', 'up', 'show', 'consider', 'fair', 'warning', 'WB', 'Rory', 'could', 'dump', 'Dean', 'knew', 'Jess', 'could', 'never', 'go', 'distance', 'could', 'take', 'heart', 'fact.What', 'third', 'season', 'Lorelai', 'Rory', 'are', 'not', 'men', 'boys', 'lives', 'rather', 'goals', 'realizing', 'dreams', 'Lorelai', 'opening', 'up', 'own', 'inn', 'Sookie', 'dream', 'put', 'front', 'burner', 'when', 'fire', 'damages', 'Independence', 'Inn', 'Tale', 'Poes', 'Fire', 'buying', 'Dragonfly', 'Inn', 'house', 'Waltons', 'know', 'television', 'history', 'be', 'problem', 'Say', 'Goodnight', 'Gracie', 'When', 'Lorelai', 'spending', 'money', 'got', 'father', 'daughter', 'education', 'Yale', 'Rory', 'who', 'cut', 'own', 'deal', 'Richard', 'Emily', 'so', 'mother', 'can', 'get', 'dream', 'too', 'Are', 'Strings', 'Pinocchio', 'supposedly', 'win-win-win', 'situation', 'be', 'seen.Of', 'course', 'Rory', 'getting', 'college', 'dreams', 'real', 'defining', 'element', 'season', 'came', 'show', 'late', 'mea', 'culpa', 'mea', 'maxima', 'culpa', 'so', 'knew', 'Rory', 'was', 'Yale', 'wondered', 'what', 'earth', 'had', 'happened', 'keep', 'going', 'Harvard', 'Well', 'Season', '3', 'find', 'out', 'dream', 'turn', 'nightmare', 'when', 'Rory', 'application', 'Harvard', 'be', 'put', 'together', 'Application', 'Anxiety', 'When', 'Paris', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'Harvard', 'Big', 'One', 'was', 'terrified', 'same', 'fate', 'awaited', 'Rory', 'when', 'Richard', 'Rory', 'interview', 'Yale', 'Let', 'Games', 'Begin', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'was', 'Lorelai', 'was', 'actually', 'wrong', 'argument', 'father', 'end', 'episode', 'too', 'one', 'two', 'Rory', 'best', 'moments', 'season', 'are', 'when', 'Richard', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'wrong', 'way', 'episode', 'when', 'Dean', 'could', 'feel', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'kid', 'heart', 'also', 'like', 'season', 'finale', 'when', 'Emily', 'being', 'stupid', 'shutting', 'out', 'Lorelai', 'could', 'use', 'one', 'free', 'spin', 'life', 'get', 'Rory', 'say', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'tell', 'Emily', 'Grandma', 'love', 'matter', 'what', 'do', 'will', 'never', 'love', 'more', 'love', 'mother', 'best', 'part', 'Rory', 'Jess', 'was', 'Lorelai', 'giving', 'Luke', 'lessons', 'what', 'be', 'parent', 'teenager', 'love', 'Other', 'big', 'moments', 'are', 'dance', 'marathon', 'Shoot', 'Gilmores', 'Do', ""n't"", 'poignant', 'flashback', 'pregnant', 'young', 'Lorelai', 'Dear', 'Emily', 'Richard', 'Emily', 'standing', 'up', 'Trix', ""'ll"", 'Do', 'Pig', 'funniest', 'moment', 'entire', 'season', 'Solemnly', 'Swear', 'when', 'Emily', 'transcript', 'Lorelai', 'deposition', 'almost', 'busted', 'gut', 'one', 'Yes', 'cried', 'when', 'Rory', 'talked', 'mom', 'graduation', 'speech', 'sweetest', 'moment', 'season', 'was', 'when', 'came', 'up', 'great', 'payoff', 'running', 'gag', 't-shirts', 'Kirk', 'was', 'selling', 'end', 'A', 'Tale', 'Poes', 'Fire', 'Admit', 'wish', 'have', 'Rory', 'Going', 'Yale', 't-shirt', 'Now', 'can', 'send', 'Rory', 'college', 'Season', '4', 'so', 'Luke', 'Lorelai', 'can', 'finally', 'get', 'same', 'page', 'kiss', 'already.The', 'DVD', 'up', 'extra', 'scenes', 'certainly', 'ample', 'justification', 'fans', 'show', 'check', 'out', 'format', 'have', 'waiting', 'see', 'baby', 'pictures', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', 'Liz', 'Torres', 'Kelly', 'Bishop', 'dancing', 'days', 'having', 'burning', 'desire', 'see', 'Sean', 'Gunn', 'do', 'robot', 'again', 'then', 'featurettes', 'childhood', 'stories', 'cast', 'best', '1980s', 'dance', 'moves', 'are', 'going', 'allow', 'move', 'having', 'other', 'images', 'visual', 'wish', 'list']",Gilmore Girls: Season 3

It is a season of change for both Lorelei (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel).  Rory is in her senior year at Chilton and Lorelei is look to move on from the Independence Inn to follow her dream and open up her own inn.  Rory also finds herself more and more attracted to Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) and drifting away from her first love Dean (Jared Padalecki) which comes to a dramatic conclusion in the ""They Shoot Gilmores, Don't They?"" episode.  The season opens with Lorelei dreaming she is married to Luke (Scott Patterson) and is pregnant with twins.  She is confused about her feelings toward him especially when he starts dating a young attorney Nicole (Tricia O'Kelley).  The season also finds Rory making a surprise choice (much to Lorelei's dismay) about college and the Independence Inn having a major fire.  Lauren Graham does her usual excellent job, but Alexis Bledel really shines in this season.

885083,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0007OY2MG,Robert Moore,"[3, 5]","For the third season in a row, THE GILMORE GIRLS excelled as the show in which absolutely nothing happened and yet in which everything happened. The show at times seems like the work of illusionists. The main plot of one early season episode? Lorelai is asked to water the yard of a new neighbor. Not a lot of seeming potential in that, and in fact there is minimal exploitation of the situation. The tone of the show is definitely that of a comedy, yet it is never a situational one. If you could time warp the writers of I LOVE LUCY into the future to see the show, they would be baffled.As always, the show is driven by the great dialogue and talk, but it is also structured around a number of long-to-resolve issues. Will Rory get into Harvard? Will she go there? Will Rory end up with Dean or Jess? Will Lorelai end up with anyone? Will Lorelai and Sookie get their inn? All of these questions get answered, not always in the ways that we anticipated. But this is one of those shows where what happens is of interest only because we like and care about the characters. ""What will happen next?"" is not a question that tortures the viewers of the show. 24 and THE GILMORE GIRLS inhabit different television universes.By Season Three we have come to love all the ritualistic aspects of the show. Ritual has always played a crucial role in great comedy, from the always-repeating antics of Laurel and Hardy to the never-ending adventures of the Roadrunner and Coyote to Kenny's tendency to die over and over. On THE GILMORE GIRLS we have grown to anticipate a new maid each week at the Gilmore residence in Hartford. And a new crusade by Taylor, as well as a new occupation or obsession by Kirk each week. Structurally, things like these are necessities on a show such as this one that is not driven by plot.While I thoroughly love the show, I do have to utter a couple of words of complaint. As someone who got a graduate degree at Yale (and therefore lack somewhat the love that undergraduates feel for their alma maters), and decided to go to Yale over Harvard, I was always perplexed by the Harvard mono-mania. The folks I knew at Yale always considered Yale to be the better school, though most of us would have swapped New Haven for Cambridge. But I want to object to a couple of other details that were a tad off. First, in ""Let the Games Begin"" they visit ""Yale,"" which was apparently a public park in California in which they put a fake ""Yale University"" sign to make the unsuspecting imagine that Yale might look like that. In fact, the fictional Yale bears utterly no resemblance to the actual Yale. There were statues on this campus, and although my memory could be playing tricks, I can recall no statues on campus apart from the very famous one of Nathan Hale (of which imitations exist in front of the Chicago Tribune Building on North Michigan Avenue and in front of the CIA Headquarters, which was largely founded by Yale graduates--well, Skull and Bones members to be even more precise) that stands in front of Connecticut Hall, where I used to take philosophy classes. Also, a good deal of the plot at one part turns on Rory getting a financial aid offer a few months after getting into Yale. Anyone who has gotten into a major university knows that financial aid offers almost always arrive at the time of the admission offer.Still, carping aside, another great season. I'd like to point out as I have in previous reviews that several people have told me how Lorelai and Rory remind them of my daughter and me. But the imp in me has to point out that my daughter's SATs were much higher than Rory's :) Anyone thinking such parental boasting inappropriate need only think of the season finale, where Lorelai intentionally goes hunting for Rory, asking for her daughter the class valedictorian. The end of the year, however, clearly marks a transition point. Rory will be off to Yale in Season Four, and Lorelai will be leaving the fire-damaged Independence Inn for her and Sookie's new Dragonfly Inn.

It's light and fun, yet deep enough to make you think about certain issues; especially those involving family; and even more specifically in the mother/daughter relationship.  We see how great this relationship can be in the Lorelei/Rory pairing; and how difficult and complex in the Emily/Lorelei one.This said, I find that the show needs to finetune some elements:1.  I agree with the previous reviewer who comments that no one in real life speaks so quickly.  In reference to Lorelei, I would also add, no one in real life speaks with so many wordplays, pop culture, and literary references and at such speaking speeds.  It's more than a bit unrealistic.  I would have to agree with Luke saying that Lorelei can be obnoxious, I feel like finding her ""off"" button many times.2.

The theory is that if a show gets to a third season, than the third season will be the best (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Sex and the City, ER, etc.)Gilmore Girls is no different improving from season two, the shows follows the adventure of Rory as she prepares to graduate high school, and finally go into college like she has been planning her whole life.  On top of that she has started a new relationship with the new guy in town.Lorelia also has her share of fun and trouble this season as Christopher and his girlfriend get back together to raise there daughter.",5,Proves my theory...

In the meantime, the inn burns severely, leaving Lorelai and the hilarious, high-strung Sookie to hatch plans for a new place that they can manage together.The one character I find tragic is Lane Kim, who is musically gifted and spirited, but this spirit is crushed by her overly strict mother.",5,The girls continue their ups and downs,1264204800,"01 23, 2010",2010,686,"['More', 'fun', 'drama', 'abound', 'third', 'season', 'smartly', 'written', 'series', 'Lorelais', 'dealing', 'many', 'conflicts', 'own', 'making', 'involving', 'Richard', 'Emily', 'self-destructive', 'Jess', 'explosive', 'Paris', 'Geller', 'more.Rory', 'academic', 'smarts', ""n't"", 'too', 'good', 'picking', 'guys', 'fall', 'love', 'Lorelai', 'Luke', 'seem', 'be', 'edging', 'closer', 'other', 'meantime', 'inn', 'severely', 'leaving', 'Lorelai', 'hilarious', 'high-strung', 'Sookie', 'hatch', 'plans', 'new', 'place', 'can', 'manage', 'together.The', 'one', 'character', 'find', 'tragic', 'Lane', 'Kim', 'who', 'musically', 'gifted', 'spirited', 'spirit', 'crushed', 'overly', 'strict', 'mother']",Gilmore Girls: Season 3
885096,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0007OY2MG,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","Season Three of the Gilmore Girls is one of the best of all seven seasons. In this season, Rory [Alexis Bledel] is in her final year at Chilton private school and faces some of the most trying times, be it manouvering political games within the student body, or the love triangle between her, Dean [Jared Padalecki] and Jess [Milo Ventimiglia]. Alexis Bledel does a wonderful job in this season and truly shows her maturing as an actress.Of course, Lorelai [Lauren Graham] continues to shine in her role as a single mom, best friend to her daughter, and aspiring inn owner. Lorelai, fresh from the romantic disappointments of the previous two seasons finds herself sort of lost, and dates around, never truly finding a soulmate. Diner owner Luke Danes [Scott Patterson] is always there to lend his unwavering support and of course, Luke and Lorelai's chemistry is simply magical to watch, be it as good friends or as two people slowly being drawn towards each other.The rocky relations between Lorelai and her parents Emily and Richard Gilmore [ Kelly Bishop and Edward Hermann] goes through its usual turbulent times and its always entertaining to see Lorelai in action and putting her parents in their place, despite their overbearing attitude. Kelly Bishop's Emily is truly a delight to watch as she plays the snooty, controlling character to perfection.Amidst the changes in the main characters' lives this season, the most significant ones are the Rory-Jess-Dean love triangle, and for once we see Rory getting out of her goody-two-shoes character by going after Jess despite being Dean's girlfriend and the episode ""They Shoot Gilmores Don't They"" shows the resolution to this. There is also the college application anxiety, is it going to be Harvard or Yale?Lorelai's dreams of opening her own inn are developed in greater detail this season, as we see her working hard towards achieving that dream, especially with a certain event that acts as a catalyst towards that end.All in all, I rank this as my favorite GG season, but all the seasons are winners of course.
