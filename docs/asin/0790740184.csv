107688,A2FQ3K6PR86U62,0790740184,Alyosha,"[1, 2]","Ecological preservation must be pretty important to Steven Segal.  Important enough to blow up an oil rig, important enough to kill about 20 people in the process.This has got to be one of the funniest films ever witnessed.  Films that weren't intended to be comical but end up as laughing stalks just because of the sheer impossibility of the action are always the best.  There's such great sardonic value in bombastity but what makes Segal's films especially laughable is that he takes himself so seriously.  I mean, as if this film weren't ridiculous enough Segal had to have a 15-minute one-on-one with the audience at the end of the film to badger them into environmental preservation.  You're just sitting there with your mouth open the whole time, practically in a state of terminal shock at the prospect that this was done with the greatest seriousness and sincerity.Some of the highlights of the film were Segal showcasing his patented groin attacks on a room full of people, choke slamming a 70-year old man through a bar table, and playing handsies with a bully shortly before convincing him to reevaluate his opinion of Native Americans.Perhaps more than anything though it's the demonization of folks (ANY folks) associated with the oil industry that really sends this film off into galaxies never previously before phathomed.  The lense through which Segal seas the oil industry is quite astonishing really; it's almost as if he sees them as an ideologically cohesive unit, akin maybe to the Bolsheviks or the Jacobins, than he sees it as just another segment of the economy.  Oil workers willingly give their lives for the company in this film, they keep a third world country's supply of ammunition at the refinery, and they even have their own battle cry (""We're Oil Workers!"") which is echoed each time they futilely try to fend off Segal.This is just hours of an Inuit running roughshot on the white man, blowing up oil rigs, the emasculation of big burly males, and enacting blood-soaked revenge on corporate, capitalist America.  In sum this is everything that socialist Hollywood dreams about.  If this film had been made in 2007 it probably would've gotten an Oscar nod.  If it had been released independently it would be hailed as the greatest thing since the Manifesto.I'm as much for conservation and protection of our forests as anyone but seriously Steven, this is just unbounded environmentalist crackpotry.  Still probably the funniest film ever.Most important lesson to take from this film: Don't ever get into a helicopter if Steven is nearby.",4,Apparently Segal Dislikes the Oil Industry Or Something.,1188086400,"08 26, 2007",2007,2575,"['Ecological', 'preservation', 'must', 'be', 'pretty', 'important', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'Important', 'blow', 'up', 'oil', 'rig', 'important', 'enough', 'kill', '20', 'people', 'process.This', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'films', 'ever', 'witnessed', 'Films', 'were', ""n't"", 'intended', 'be', 'comical', 'end', 'up', 'laughing', 'stalks', 'just', 'sheer', 'impossibility', 'action', 'are', 'always', 'best', 'such', 'great', 'sardonic', 'value', 'bombastity', 'what', 'Segal', 'films', 'especially', 'laughable', 'so', 'seriously', 'mean', 'film', 'were', ""n't"", 'ridiculous', 'enough', 'Segal', 'had', 'have', '15-minute', 'one-on-one', 'audience', 'end', 'film', 'badger', 'environmental', 'preservation', ""'re"", 'just', 'sitting', 'there', 'mouth', 'whole', 'time', 'practically', 'state', 'terminal', 'shock', 'prospect', 'was', 'done', 'greatest', 'seriousness', 'sincerity.Some', 'highlights', 'film', 'were', 'Segal', 'showcasing', 'patented', 'groin', 'attacks', 'room', 'full', 'people', 'choke', 'slamming', '70-year', 'old', 'man', 'bar', 'table', 'playing', 'handsies', 'bully', 'shortly', 'convincing', 'reevaluate', 'opinion', 'Native', 'Americans.Perhaps', 'more', 'anything', 'demonization', 'folks', 'ANY', 'folks', 'associated', 'oil', 'industry', 'really', 'film', 'off', 'galaxies', 'never', 'previously', 'phathomed', 'lense', 'Segal', 'seas', 'oil', 'industry', 'quite', 'astonishing', 'really', 'almost', 'ideologically', 'cohesive', 'unit', 'akin', 'maybe', 'Bolsheviks', 'Jacobins', 'just', 'segment', 'economy', 'Oil', 'workers', 'willingly', 'give', 'lives', 'company', 'film', 'keep', 'third', 'world', 'country', 'supply', 'ammunition', 'refinery', 'even', 'have', 'own', 'battle', 'cry', ""'re"", 'Oil', 'Workers', 'time', 'futilely', 'try', 'fend', 'off', 'Segal.This', 'just', 'hours', 'Inuit', 'running', 'roughshot', 'white', 'man', 'blowing', 'up', 'oil', 'rigs', 'emasculation', 'big', 'burly', 'males', 'enacting', 'blood-soaked', 'revenge', 'corporate', 'capitalist', 'America', 'sum', 'everything', 'socialist', 'Hollywood', 'dreams', 'about', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'made', '2007', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'independently', 'would', 'be', 'hailed', 'greatest', 'thing', 'Manifesto.I', ""'m"", 'much', 'conservation', 'protection', 'forests', 'anyone', 'seriously', 'Steven', 'just', 'unbounded', 'environmentalist', 'crackpotry', 'Still', 'probably', 'funniest', 'film', 'ever.Most', 'important', 'lesson', 'take', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'get', 'helicopter', 'Steven', 'nearby']",N/A

On Deadly Ground is one of them. Steven Seagal directs and stars in the film and makes a statement about the environment. And guess what? The statement is still as relevant as ever today. The ending is one of the best editing works when it comes to putting all of what had transpired during the film into a gist. Yeah, On Deadly Ground borrows a lot of elements from Above the Law including the oft played bar scene. Of course, I knew what was going to happen before it happened. I am rather more disappointed in the editing work, not showing the aikido movements clearly enough. Every cut is too short to soak in the actions. I am not sure what to make of Michael Caine, but has he learned his lesson from Jaws: The Revenge?

However, I didn't buy the nonsense that this silly, illogical piece of fluff was peddling to the audience.""On Deadly Ground"" stars Michael Caine as the demonic head of an oil company.  He was the sole shining star in this stinker of a movie.  How he ever got talked into starring in this film is one of the greatest mysteries known to man.  Caine's character was really scummy but you almost had to like him since he was the only one with any acting skill up on the screen.Steven Seagal, who also directed and produced this film, was his usual one note superhero/killing machine character that he always is.  He single-handedly seemed to be killing more people than any oil spill has ever done.The plot is simply laughable.

107702,A1ZSOK69XSXF73,0790740184,"Duckman ""Morbid Cynic""","[3, 7]","I'm not a fan of Steven Seagal movies, but this is easily one of his worst because while his other movies are at least honest with themselves with being merely vehicles for action and graphic violence such as Out for Justice and Under Siege, On Deadly Ground stinks a whole lot more because of the fact that it tries way too hard to convey a serious message and is a really bad case of an actor inflating his ego.  Aside from these, the movie is extremely heavy-handed with its message and the very concept of the movie is doomed from the start since environmentalism and violent action aren't exactly good bed buddies.The plot is that in Alaska, a giant oil company called Aegis is racing to build a giant oil rig on a portion of land that if the rig isn't operational within 13 days, the land ownership rights will go back to the Inuits.  Aegis CEO Michael Jennings (played by Michael Caine) is ordering the construction of the rig to be built with components that fail safety tests, which causes suspicion upon Hugh Palmer and Forest Taft (Steven Seagal).  When Hugh considers telling the EPA about these failed safety tests, Jennings sends out MacGruder and Otto to ""take care of him.""  Forest is betrayed by Aegis by an attempt to kill him with a planned explosion and when he's rescued by Inuits Masu and her dad (and chief) Silook.  After being saved, Masu helps Taft strike back at Aegis.As stated before, the message about how ""oil companies are evil"" is so heavy-handed and one-sided it'll make anyone with a single brain cell sick.  Examples of this are how Hugh is brutally killed by MacGruder and Otto and of Jennings making that commercial to dupe the public into thinking that Aegis cares about the environment by making him look like he loves caribou.  The former is way overdone because after you see Otto smash his fingers, you get the point that Aegis is a bad company but they drag this out by actually having Otto kill Hugh with a pipe cutter.  The latter is supposed to establish the notion that Aegis are a bunch of two-faced evil scumbags, as if we couldn't figure that out in the first six or seven minutes of the movie.  More heavy-handed melodrama enforcing said notion takes place when MacGruder shoots Silook in front of many other Inuits with sad music and shots of kids crying.  WE GET IT!!  THEY'RE BAD PEOPLE!!The acting is bad, as suspected, but the dialog is worth noting because it's actually worse.  The most notable bad dialog has to be the following from MacGruder and the following from mercenary Stone (R. Lee Irmy):""Have you listened to yourself?  Everything with you is I, I, I, I.  There's no 'I' in team!!  It's T-E-A-M!!""""Protect this rig like it's your sister's cherry!!""There's even moments where Taft tries to be deep.  For one, there's actually a scene towards the beginning where a barfly beats up an Inuit and says really classy things to him like ""Dances with whiskey.""  Taft doesn't like this and confronts the barfly; the barfly's friends try to beat Taft but end up getting their butts handed to them with lots of attacks to the testicles and after getting to the head barfly, Taft beats him into a pulp and says the following:""What does it take to change the essence of a man?""The barfly responds by saying ""Time, time.""  The barfly walks off crying with a bloody nose.  Wow, I'm really feeling the intelligence and emotion behind this.  Seagal's ego is inflated to critical levels with the way he's dressed by wearing a Native American style coat and with the forced symbolism in the ""vision"" he had of choosing between the hot, evil naked woman and the good, elderly woman.I could forgive this movie a little had the action been entertaining, but it isn't.  Most of the fights are really one-sided because aside from that trap that made Taft switch sides, Taft doesn't take any hits from the bad guys.  I don't know about you, but isn't having gun fights on an oil rig extremely dangerous?  Also, isn't blowing up a giant oil rig extremely harmful to the environment, throwing the movie's message right out the window?  In the end, the Alaskan government lauds Taft for his actions; despite the fact that he committed murder, industrial sabotage, and struck a deadly blow to the state economy.  If that isn't bad enough, Taft lectures everyone with textbook conspiracy theorist rhetoric about big corporations polluting the earth, and it goes on for roughly five minutes.  At least Warner Brothers talked Seagal to cut out some of this since the original portion of this ran for fifteen minutes.There's some redeemable factors in this movie; the explosions are kinda entertaining, seeing Hugh scream after getting his fingers smashed was unintentionally humorous, and seeing Taft push MacGruder into a rotating helicopter blade and getting decapitated was pretty cool (it's not everyday that you see that).  If you REALLY want to see this movie, you're better off finding a video compilation on YouTube consisting of all the action scenes/deaths in this awful movie.  Thanks to YouTube, I watched this dreck for free; I didn't even have to blow a dollar at Family Video to see it.This movie is proof that Steven Seagal doesn't even have 1/10 the worth of Arnold Schwarzenegger.  While Arnie has had a couple of bad movies, he did after all, give us Terminators 1 and 2 and Total Recall.  His ""guilty pleasure"" movies such as The Running Man and Commando, have much more entertainment value and the action in those movies isn't as one-sided as those in Seagal's.After watching this, it makes me glad that Seagal isn't popular anymore.",1,"One deadly, awful movie.  15%",1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,5592,"[""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'movies', 'easily', 'one', 'worst',

So groaning I said, fine, whatever, and in all good faith we sat back to enjoy the marvelous countryside of Alaska and to drink in this story of a man, Forrest Taft, who at the beginning of the picture works on a huge oil rig for a wicked corporation, and who later changes his mind about how he's living his life.  People say Steven Segall never changes, but here's a movie in which he undertakes the biggest journey of them all, cleansing his soul in the process.  He's not good at acting, but that's neither here nor there.  If you ask me, his direction of this movie was spot on and he should definitely have gotten more offers to direct.  It's just a shame his leading actor was so wooden and chubby.Forrest Taft has one great friend aboard the oil rig, a crotchety old coot who's always berating Forrest for forgetting the little people and sucking up to the big boys.  Blinded by greed, Forrest doesn't listen to the old man.  Then one day, the old man threatens to blow whistles on Michael Caine and Caine has him horribly tortured and murdered by John C. McGinley.  They break each of his fingers with an ivory tusk!  Probably whalebone, eh?  Then they castrated him with a plumbing tool!  I can still hear the screams of the old guy--nobody deserves to die that way.All in search of a computer disk in which the old codger had named names and shown that the corporation, in a hurry to exercise mining rights granted them twenty years ago by unthinking tribal leaders, the corporation has used unsafe equipment that has caused the death of several innocent workers.When Forrest Taft learns of this death, he goes a little crazy and begins a vision quest in which he becomes a bear.  Not the kind of bear we have here in San Francisco, but a spirit bear, and a Native wise man tells him, ""You are a bear, you have a destiny to fulfill.""  Blown up by Caine's henchmen and left for dead, Taft is rescued by a pack of polar bear hunting Indians, who tie him to their dog sled and take him home to a beautiful native hut on multilevels, where toothless hags grin lopsidedly and Forrest really trips out when the chief plucks bullets out of his spine with eagle-like talons.It becomes a race between starting up the oil rig, and demolishing it in a sort of ecoterrorist act.  Seagal the director makes sure our sympathies lie with the right cause.  Joan Chen is on hand as the chief's daughter, she's great of course but why didn't they think of hiring a Native American actress, would that have been difficult, Warner Brothers?  I don't know, it just rang false to me.  Otherwise the movie showed a roughhouse world of hard drinking, hard working, hard loving factory workers all sweating blood and tears doing great work except in the service of evil, corrupt people determined to destroy our beautiful planet.The movie has Billy Bob Thornton prominently in the credits, but he gets to say about three things.  The movie's credits say his character is called ""Homer Carlton,"" but how do they know?Anyhow enough nitpicking, see it for yourself!

Because he's so awesome. Extras cry ""that fire's out for sure"" upon seeing him. Because he's so awesome. He manages to change a man's racial attitudes by beating him up. Awesome. It is this same awesomeness which leads Taft to go on an Indian vision quest, despite not being Indian. After this he explains to the love interest that even though, he ""loves the spirit world"", it's a load of crap with no value in real life. She agrees with him, probably on account of his awesomeness. This awesomeness convinces R. Lee Emery to give a speach about Taft's greatness, despite never meeting him. Taft's awesomeness disposes of the female villain without him laying a finger on her. It also blows up an oil refinery without damadging the envoironment. Most impressively, Taft gets an audience to applaud a speach praising electric cars, despite them being the most ridiculous-looking things I've ever seen. I suppose Taft's awesomeness outweighed the car's ridiculousness for the audience, much like it does for me. And I haven't even mentioned the coke-bottle silencer!So Class, Professor Looming's Evil Twin would like to conclude that this film, particularly the character Forest Taft, is awesome.

I've only seen maybe four Seagal films, but they all were the same to me. They all had the same dialogue, pretty much the same villains, and all of them involved Seagal confronting someone in a bar. Van Damme's films usually don't feel the same. They are all somewhat different and stand out among themselves. Granted, they aren't artful pieces of cinema, but at least you can tell which is which. ""On Deadly Ground"" is Steven Seagal's directorial debut and, as a first attempt at directing action, I can't really complain that much. The choreography isn't as bad as usual and some of the explosions are pretty cool. But the story is mind-numbingly awful along with the acting. And when I say the acting is bad, I mean it's worse than the usual dumb action movie. Sadly, the things that make ""On Deadly Ground"" a bad movie are the same reasons that make Seagal's other movies such bores. The story and pace are so painfully predictable and the lesson to be learned from this film is weak and pretty lame. Does Seagal have fans anymore? I know Van Damme has a cult following, but does Seagal? I'd be interested to know. So far everone I've talked to hates the man.

Early in his career, he was able to capitalize on his height, his surly disposition, and his martial arts to establish his reputation as a serious action star.  But with ON DEADLY GROUND, Seagal seems to be taking the same path that Tom Loughlin took a few decades ago.  Loughlin, you remember, was an up and coming hapkido star who took a wrong turn in his Billy Jack spiritual message movies.  His career flattened out, and Seagal's own career path has not, even now, recovered from the debacle that is this film.Seagal goes against the big oil companies whose leader is a sadly miscast Michael Caine, who ought to have known better than to sign on the dotted line for this one.  Seagal spends most of the latter part of the film in an oilrig, planting bombs as he goes.  They go off, not leaving him much of an opportunity to manhandle the usual bunch of flunkeys.  Fans of fight scenes will surely be disappointed with ON DEADLY GROUND since these scenes are few, far between, and generally uninteresting.  Fans of a tightly plotted drama will also be disappointed since the climax is hardly a thrilling one.  Finally, the last few minutes of the film is a laughable surrender to the politically correct Green Peace fringe who surely plunked down his salary.  What ON DEADLY GROUND proves is that the 'deadly' of the title refers more to a sense of boredom than to a sense of danger.

They're easy to watch, and I have actually enjoyed a couple. He's never going to be the best actor, as he plays the same character, with the same facial expression in every movie. But hey, he has the moves.There's not much storyline considering. A severely black haired Michael Caine, playing Michael Jennings, (who does actually look like he covered his head with oil), is the bad guy of the movie, who wants to build an oil rig, complete with dodgy parts, in Alaska, before the ground reverts back to the Eskimos. Pretty blah. Forrest (Seagal) interferes, and promptly gets blown up. But the story isn't over. He gets rescued by the Eskimos, and goes on a one-man rampage against Jennings.From here the film descends into spiritual and environmental nonsense - I'm all for attempting to save the planet, but this is nonsense. Most of the dialogue sounds hokey, and Billy Bob Thornton is nowhere to be seen in this movie. (Seriously, his name is in the credits, but I cannot see him!) There's a big bar brawl, where Forrest makes a big man cry (the bad guy from Beethoven 2), and an old guy features quite a bit, in a painful sequence. He's hiding a very important disc don't you know.There's nothing we haven't seen in any other Seagal movie. Unfortunately, this also has Seagal's name as director, and that's a big mistake. Occasionally (notice I said occasionally) actors think they can direct. Sometimes they can. In Seagal's case, he has no idea how to link scenes together, and apparently, his god awful speech at the end was supposed to last forever. And then some! No thank you.On Deadly Ground is a little bit too much on the environmental side, with not enough ideas gone into the script or the actors. Michael Caine? Well wrong in this role. So wrong.

Steven Seagal was at one time a big action star in the early 90s.  He did a few movies, did Under Siege, this and a few others.  He was doing fine, but around the time this movie came out, his A-status started declining.  For the next 10 years, him and Van Damme would be dueling it out for B-movie action flicks that would end up filling the shelves of MovieTowns across this country.But before Fire Down Below, before The Glimmer Man, there was On Deadly Ground.  I went onto wikipedia and its defined as an environmental action-adventure film; I don't ever remember there ever being an environmental action film, let alone an environmental action-adventure film.  Anyways, Segal plays Forrest Taft, a specialist in putting out oil fires.The movie takes place in the Alaskan wilderness where Michael Caine plays an evil oil tycoon attempting to open a new refinery on native Alaskan lands.  With that description, knowing that its an action feature, anyone would be excited, and there is the typical Seagal type action, almost ludicrous to the point of entertainment; somewhere along the way, the movie fails on all levels, becoming purely an exercise and how to make a terrible action flick.I'm not sure how this movie got made, but I would imagine that Steven Seagal was meditating one day, then called his agent an included a rough outline of his ""vision"" of a hero saving the environment; the hero of course, is Seagal.  He might have only had a crude vision, but nonetheless, it would serve as the backbone of On Deadly Ground: an evil oil tycoon reminiscent of a rail baron, a Death Star-like oil rig that endangers the bunny rabbits of Alaska, the backdrop of Alaska and finally(most importantly) a vigalante-martial arts-pony tailed-jedi master-32nd level buddhist-crusader that is out there to save anyone who needs helps by bombing buildings, assaulting people less skillful then he and delivering wisdom that is not needed.Michael Caine plays the bad guy, he has the Col. Sanders tie so he is supposed to be like an industrialist with a cowboy s***-kicking-killing attitude.  John C. Mcginley plays his main henchman, but looks more annoyed throughout the movie.  Steven Seagal is a firefighting expert.  It is never explained his background or heritage.  He shows up to put out an oil fire then hangs out at the local tavern wearing an indian jacket then beats the s*** out of someone who roughs up a drunken defenseless indian.  Seagal kicks ass, delivers some poetry and then takes off.  But we never know if he's part indian or just a douche bag with a pony tail.I mean, he works for the bad guy at the beginning of the movie.  But after the first oil fire he puts out, he begins to question Michael Caine's ethics or regards to the oil-rig safely.  But here is my take, Seagal looks and acts like he gets paid handsomely for his job(he is good at it), but yet he was ok with working Michael Caine the whole time before that??  I mean, wouldn't have Segal had a decent enough BS-detector to tell that he was an evil guy before that??  But no, this movie doesn't even have that type of logic, so what we gave is sort of a cat and mouse between the bad guys and Seagal, during which Seagal takes retreat at an eskimo village and at his own mountain retreat, where he gathers his wisdom and animal spirit necessary to kill Michael Caine, everyone working for Michael Caine and to bomb the entire oil-rig which is the largest oil-rig in the world.Billy Bob Thornton also makes an appearance in this movie, playing chubby Billy Bob that was during his mid 90s movie career.  He plays one of the henchman at the oil rig who is blown up by Seagal.  R. Lee Ermy is brought in to help track and kill Seagal, but suffers the same fate.Overall, I give this movie one Amazon star out of five.  Even with very low expectations and the understanding of how incredibly bad the movie will be, it still fails to deliver the ""so bad its good"" entertainment value; its so bad, that is just bad.  Seagal blows up everyone and the oil rig, then gives vigilante-esque speech at the end, where he encourages everyone to drive solar cars, while he drives around in a hummer killing oil leaders.  The more times I see this movie, the more I think Seagal was the villain.",1,"This movie is so bad, that it wants me to hate it, which I like, but then I still hate it!!",1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,4396,"['Where', 'do', 'begin', 'movie', '.Let', 'give', 'brief', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'especially', 'younger', 'not', 'aware', 'overall', 'hijinks', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'big', 'action', 'star', 'early', '90s', 'did', 'few', 'movies', 'did', 'Siege', 'few', 'others', 'was', 'doing', 'fine', 'time', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'A-status', 'started', 'declining', 'next', '10', 'years', 'Van', 'Damme', 'would', 'be', 'dueling', 'out', 'B-movie', 'action', 'flicks', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'filling', 'shelves', 'MovieTowns', 'country.But', 'Fire', 'Down', 'Below', 'Glimmer', 'Man', 'was', 'Deadly', 'Ground', 'went', 'wikipedia', 'defined', 'environmental', 'action-adventure', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'remember', 'there', 'ever', 'being', 'environmental', 'action', 'film', 'let', 'alone', 'environmental', 'action-adventure', 'film', 'Anyways', 'Segal', 'Forrest', 'Taft', 'specialist', 'putting', 'out', 'oil', 'fires.The', 'movie', 'place', 'Alaskan', 'wilderness', 'where', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'evil', 'oil', 'tycoon', 'attempting', 'open', 'new', 'refinery', 'native', 'Alaskan', 'lands', 'description', 'knowing', 'action', 'feature', 'anyone', 'would', 'be', 'excited', 'typical', 'Seagal', 'type', 'action', 'almost', 'ludicrous', 'point', 'entertainment', 'somewhere', 'way', 'movie', 'levels', 'becoming', 'purely', 'exercise', 'how', 'make', 'terrible', 'action', 'flick.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'movie', 'got', 'made', 'would', 'imagine', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'was', 'meditating', 'one', 'day', 'then', 'called', 'agent', 'included', 'rough', 'outline', 'vision', 'hero', 'saving', 'environment', 'hero', 'course', 'Seagal', 'might', 'have', 'only', 'had', 'crude', 'vision', 'nonetheless', 'would', 'serve', 'backbone', 'Deadly', 'Ground', 'evil', 'oil', 'tycoon', 'reminiscent', 'rail', 'baron', 'Death', 'Star-like', 'oil', 'rig', 'bunny', 'rabbits', 'Alaska', 'backdrop', 'Alaska', 'finally', 'most', 'importantly', 'vigalante-martial', 'arts-pony', 'tailed-jedi', 'master-32nd', 'level', 'buddhist-crusader', 'there', 'save', 'anyone', 'who', 'helps', 'bombing', 'buildings', 'assaulting', 'people', 'less', 'skillful', 'then', 'delivering', 'wisdom', 'not', 'needed.Michael', 'Caine', 'bad', 'guy', 'Col.', 'Sanders', 'tie', 'so', 'supposed', 'be', 'industrialist', 'cowboy', 's***-kicking-killing', 'attitude', 'John', 'C.', 'Mcginley', 'main', 'henchman', 'more', 'annoyed', 'movie', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'firefighting', 'expert', 'never', 'explained', 'background', 'heritage', 'up', 'put', 'out', 'oil', 'fire', 'then', 'out', 'local', 'tavern', 'wearing', 'indian', 'jacket', 'then', 's***', 'someone', 'who', 'up', 'drunken', 'defenseless', 'indian', 'Seagal', 'kicks', 'ass', 'poetry', 'then', 'off', 'never', 'know', 'part', 'indian', 'just', 'douche', 'bag', 'pony', 'tail.I', 'mean', 'bad', 'guy', 'beginning', 'movie', 'first', 'oil', 'fire', 'out', 'question', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'ethics', 'regards', 'oil-rig', 'safely', 'here', 'take', 'Seagal', 'paid', 'handsomely', 'job', 'good', 'yet', 'was', 'ok', 'working', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'whole', 'time', 'mean', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'Segal', 'had', 'decent', 'enough', 'BS-detector', 'tell', 'was', 'evil', 'guy', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'type', 'logic', 'what', 'gave', 'sort', 'cat', 'mouse', 'bad', 'guys', 'Seagal', 'Seagal', 'retreat', 'eskimo', 'village', 'own', 'mountain', 'retreat', 'where', 'wisdom', 'animal', 'spirit', 'necessary', 'kill', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'everyone', 'working', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'bomb', 'entire', 'oil-rig', 'largest', 'oil-rig', 'world.Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'also', 'appearance', 'movie', 'playing', 'chubby', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'was', 'mid', '90s', 'movie', 'career', 'one', 'henchman', 'oil', 'rig', 'who', 'blown', 'up', 'Seagal', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermy', 'brought', 'help', 'track', 'kill', 'Seagal', 'same', 'fate.Overall', 'give', 'movie', 'one', 'Amazon', 'star', 'five', 'Even', 'very', 'low', 'expectations', 'understanding', 'how', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'still', 'deliver', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'entertainment', 'value', 'bad', 'just', 'bad', 'Seagal', 'up', 'everyone', 'oil', 'rig', 'then', 'vigilante-esque', 'speech', 'end', 'where', 'everyone', 'drive', 'solar', 'cars', 'around', 'hummer', 'killing', 'oil', 'leaders', 'more', 'times', 'see', 'movie', 'more', 'think', 'Seagal', 'was', 'villain']",N/A

I know I'm not the first person to have said so, but even as a fan of Steven Seagal, this film really isn't a lot of fun. I don't know if it's because of the story (painfully melodramatic, even though I'm an environmentalist myself), the silly scenarios, or simply because I'm comparing the film with Seagal's previous venture - the $156 million action-powerhouse,Under Siege- but it just isn't as good as the stuff he did before in his early career.The story is the first of several environmentalist-thrillers for Seagal, and goes like this:Seagal is a specialist fireman employed by an Alaskan oil-drilling corporation run by a ruthless tycoon (Michael Caine,Batman Begins), who openly demonstrates his disregard for the damage his work does to the land and the native inhabitants. After he expresses doubt in the company's integrity, Seagal is targeted for assassination but survives, and is nursed back to health by local Inuits, who guide him to a spiritual reawakening as a fighter for the good of the people and an enemy of ""Big Oil"".While I don't mind a green message in an action film, it's hard to imagine the script being handled any more hamishly than by star/director Steven: the oil corporation is the most unabashed, politically-incorrect evildoers you'd ever want to see, with Caine freely throwing out phrases like ""the godd*mn Eskimos"" - Eskimos which, for the most part, seem unaware that they're living in the 20th century. Seeing that the issues within the film are relevant to the real world, it's disappointing that a legitimate environmentalist like Seagal would overdramatize and sensationalize them so he can appear a bigger hero.You'd think that the movie would still be able to fall back on action to make up for the story, but ""Deadly Ground"" is an overall failure here, too: Seagal has an absolutely awesome bar fight early on in the movie and later uses a soda bottle as a pistol silencer, but the following aikido and shootouts are purely step-by-step and offer next to no ingenuity for the remaining 80 minutes.There's one scene in the film that really sums the whole thing up: after seeing a drunken native being abused by a white oil worker, Seagal challenges the man to a game of hand-slap, after every try of which the man lets Seagal beat him to the ground, instead of taking flight or trying to fight back. This silly and forced-looking encounter is performed simply so Seagal can make ask a philosophical question, which really has no relevance to the rest of the movie. Personally, I'm convinced that if Seagal had never done ""Deadly Ground"", he would've stayed in the big-budget market longer than he did...but those are just my thoughts.",2,"""What does it take to change the essence of a man?""",1211328000,"05 21, 2008",2008,2723,"['do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Deadly', 'Ground', 'very', 'much', 'know', ""'m"", 'not', 'first', 'person', 'have', 'said', 'so', 'even', 'fan', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'lot', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'painfully', 'melodramatic', 'even', ""'m"", 'environmentalist', 'silly', 'scenarios', 'simply', ""'m"", 'comparing', 'film', 'Seagal', 'previous', 'venture', '156', 'million', 'action-powerhouse', 'Siege-', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'stuff', 'did', 'early', 'career.The', 'story', 'first', 'several', 'environmentalist-thrillers', 'Seagal', 'Seagal', 'specialist', 'fireman', 'employed', 'Alaskan', 'oil-drilling', 'corporation', 'run', 'ruthless', 'tycoon', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'who', 'openly', 'disregard', 'damage', 'work', 'land', 'native', 'inhabitants', 'doubt', 'company', 'integrity', 'Seagal', 'targeted', 'assassination', 'nursed', 'back', 'health', 'local', 'Inuits', 'who', 'guide', 'spiritual', 'reawakening', 'fighter', 'good', 'people', 'enemy', 'Big', 'Oil', '.While', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'green', 'message', 'action', 'film', 'hard', 'imagine', 'script', 'being', 'handled', 'more', 'hamishly', 'star/director', 'Steven', 'oil', 'corporation', 'most', 'unabashed', 'politically-incorrect', 'evildoers', ""'d"", 'ever', 'want', 'see', 'Caine', 'freely', 'throwing', 'out', 'phrases', 'godd*mn', 'Eskimos', 'Eskimos', 'most', 'part', 'seem', 'unaware', ""'re"", 'living', '20th', 'century', 'Seeing', 'issues', 'film', 'are', 'relevant', 'real', 'world', 'disappointing', 'legitimate', 'environmentalist', 'Seagal', 'would', 'overdramatize', 'sensationalize', 'so', 'can', 'appear', 'bigger', 'hero.You', ""'d"", 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'able', 'fall', 'back', 'action', 'make', 'up', 'story', 'Deadly', 'Ground', 'overall', 'failure', 'here', 'too', 'Seagal', 'absolutely', 'awesome', 'bar', 'fight', 'early', 'movie', 'later', 'soda', 'bottle', 'pistol', 'silencer', 'following', 'aikido', 'shootouts', 'are', 'purely', 'step-by-step', 'offer', 'next', 'ingenuity', 'remaining', '80', 'one', 'scene', 'film', 'really', 'whole', 'thing', 'up', 'seeing', 'drunken', 'native', 'being', 'abused', 'white', 'oil', 'worker', 'Seagal', 'man', 'game', 'hand-slap', 'try', 'man', 'Seagal', 'beat', 'ground', 'instead', 'taking', 'flight', 'trying', 'fight', 'back', 'silly', 'forced-looking', 'encounter', 'performed', 'simply', 'so', 'Seagal', 'can', 'make', 'ask', 'philosophical', 'question', 'really', 'relevance', 'rest', 'movie', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'Seagal', 'had', 'never', 'done', 'Deadly', 'Ground', 'would', ""'ve"", 'stayed', 'big-budget', 'market', 'longer', 'did', 'are', 'just', 'thoughts']",N/A

Of course Steve needs to punch up the roughnecks, drown an oil executive  in sea sludge and blow up the world's largest oil rig to make this point - but of course that is part of the fun! (BTW the rig demolition is designed to 'implode' instead of explode to avoid an oil spill.) Lots of good pyrotechnics and some good casting.

107730,A363QRXP83K8ZE,0790740184,"N. P. Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[7, 13]","After making his most successful film in 1992 (Under Siege) Seagal was then given the power to produce and direct a film.  Audiences are still suffering today.Seagal starred in some quick but competent cop on a mission flicks in the late 80s and early 90s.  Then something happened.  He got power, and he decided he wanted to make a statement.  This is rarely a good idea for actors, specifically action movie stars with ponytails.In this one, Seagal is fighting the evil oil industry.  A massive oil company is up to some shananagins in Alaska, and it's up to Seagal as an EPA agent (with a shadowy background) to stop these injustices.Seagal's solution to the violence and environmentally unsound practices of the company is to kill a number of people and then cause more environmental damage by blowing up a pricey oil rig.  The company is headed by none other than Michael Caine, who is sporting oil-black hair and some ridiculous rubber-face makeup.  Caine makes the film worthwhile for those who are morbid enough to watch a fine actor's most shameless hour.I believe, most of the time, that bad movies are not born but made.  Seagal may feel that the oil industry is shafting the people, and he is likely right, but the form his statement takes is ludicrous even if he doesn't realize it.  Actually, Seagal probably believes he's making an important statement and serious film (while satisfynig fans) and this sincerity is what makes it all the more laughable.The film is appalling in most respects, but it offers the violence you came to see.  Seagal was just plain fat by this point (though he would, in fact, get fatter) but it doesn't stop him from dispatching all level of minion from Caine.Seagal finally lost it when he made a speech during the finale that denounced the practices of the oil industry.  Honestly, the guy might be sincere, and he actually has valid points (there is doubtlessly shady business happening with respects to oil in the world) but his forum is questionable.The plot has many holes, the victims have holes, Seagal is fat, there is a spiritual angle that exploits typical conceptions of Eskimos and Native Americans and Michael Caine is priceless.Simply a must for the bad movie addict, this is astonishingly not even close to Seagal's worse.

Seagal didn't have any plans in making one. He was asked to come back once more for a sequel. In many occasions he refused. He later changed his mind when he asked for demands. this demand was that he wanted Warner Bros to produce a movie for him. And let Seagal himself direct the project. This project became to be known as ""On Deadly Ground"".In On Deadly Ground Seagal Plays Forest Taft (I would Pay 20 buck to see who has that name in real life), an expert at taking out oil rig related fires. Taft is hired by Michael Jennings (Michael Caine) while taking down one of these fires, Taft notices that there is faulty equipment and that they are not reporting any of it. Because if they did it would cost the Aegis Oil Company millions in revenue, and the land would be given back to the Eskimos. Taft digs in too deep, and Jennings wants him out of the way. Taft Now will do what it takes to defeat the greedy Oil dude and save the Eskimo tribe whoopee (Sarcasm)The big issue with the movie, aside from its somewhat original and good intentional idea, it doesn't pass from being a dull action movie. Besides it uses the same idea from Under Siege, bad guys don't know that the cook is an Ex Navy Seal, here in On Deadly Ground They don't know that the guy who takes out the oil fires is a possible ex C.I.A Agent; Give me a breakit was believable the first time in Under Siege, but it wont be if it is constantly being used over and over again. Interestingly the movie is most likely remembered for the ""Essence Of A Man"" scene. In that scene Seagal defends a stereotypical Native American from a cocky guy. After brutally beating him up, Seagal asks this cocky dude ""What does it take to change the essence of a man?"" the cocky guy replies, with a bloody nose ""I need time"" what the rubber ducky is that? If you simply view this scene you will know what I am referring to. The scene is so ludicrous and pointless. Aside from its stupidity, bad depiction of a Eskimos, Seagal knocking out opponents via  the groin area to often and even having a fight with a grizzly bear; aside all this  The movie has really good cinematography; the scenery of the wild is well photographed. Seagal is not bad with the camera, just bad with storyline. the ending which Seagal tried to bring a message to the public about climate change and toxic waste feels preachy (even after the studio cut 11 min out of the ending due to poor screen test) I guess if you are a Seagal fan it's ok to own it, and thinking about it, this movie is not as bad as his future DTV releases.

It's the powerhouse that began the downward spiral of Seagal's career placing him the the elite direct to dvd category which ultimately leads to the Wal-Mart $5 bin. He's still somewhat slender and sports the full out ponytail but shows glimmers of the Seagal we know and love today. Yeah the Seagal that swears he's black, can barely pull off his lines, and can be found with traces of Egg McMuffin on him at anytime.We start off with environmental agent Forrest Taft(Seagal) who works for Aegis Oil Company in Alaska. Taft is their main man and treated like royalty among the other greased up oil workers. The company CEO Michael Jennings plays the good guy in his commercials but is really bad news behind closed doors. He's finishing up a state of the art rig but hits a snag when he only has 13 days to complete the job or the land goes back to the eskimos and the Alaskan government. One of Seagal's old friends Hugh Palmer,who looks like a b version of Lee Marvin, has a disk with proof of defective equipment that would set the rig back way beyond the deadline. This info becomes evident to Jennings and he sends his goons to take him out. Once they wack Palmer Seagal springs into action and decides to take down the Aegis corporation one broken neck at a time. With the help of his newly found Eskimo friends there is no stopping the wrath of Taft. The following 60 minutes is non stop beat downs and explosions Steven Seagal style.This one really had it all including a star studded cast consisting of Michael Caine, John C.
