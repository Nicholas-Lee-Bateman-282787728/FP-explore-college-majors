256150,A2JEDX851ET4Y8,6301569229,"Pumpkin Toss ""Dearest""","[0, 1]","Okay first of all, this movie can not be defined as horror, comedy, or dramatic because it is all three. I feel this movie could be a cult classic, if it were marketed correctly. It's so bizarre, twisteed, goofy, and stupid how can it be labeled? I can guarantee for a person to enjoy this film he/she has to be in a ""what the?"" mood. Mixed lightly with a teaspoon of ""Okay?"" Some of the weirder scenes in the film: 1) at bosse's funeral the clown stands infront of the casket, and talks about how his boss would get a thrill from his secretary's t_ts. 2) The talking pepperoni puppet who likes to argue with his owner 3)the freak out scene when Bruce Burger imagines everyone dancing about, while one lady prances around in a pair of bat styled wings.Probably one of the goofiest ideas was the mob boss who bought the park...rip off of the God Father Movie. One surprise is that one of the dorky security guards was played by the same woman who was Mimi in The Drew Carry Show.As I said, this movie has a real flavor to it, but it's a taste you have to aquire first before eating it all up.",5,Excellent movie-but what you should know,1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,1091,"['Okay', 'first', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'defined', 'horror', 'comedy', 'dramatic', 'three', 'feel', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'cult', 'classic', 'were', 'marketed', 'correctly', 'so', 'bizarre', 'twisteed', 'goofy', 'stupid', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'labeled', 'can', 'guarantee', 'person', 'enjoy', 'film', 'he/she', 'be', 'what', 'mood', 'Mixed', 'lightly', 'teaspoon', 'Okay', 'weirder', 'scenes', 'film', '1', 'bosse', 'funeral', 'clown', 'stands', 'infront', 'casket', 'talks', 'how', 'boss', 'would', 'get', 'thrill', 'secretary', 't_ts', '2', 'talking', 'pepperoni', 'puppet', 'who', 'argue', 'owner', '3', 'freak', 'out', 'scene', 'when', 'Bruce', 'Burger', 'everyone', 'dancing', 'one', 'lady', 'around', 'pair', 'bat', 'styled', 'wings.Probably', 'one', 'goofiest', 'ideas', 'was', 'mob', 'boss', 'who', 'bought', 'park', 'God', 'Father', 'Movie', 'One', 'surprise', 'one', 'dorky', 'security', 'guards', 'was', 'played', 'same', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'Mimi', 'Drew', 'Carry', 'Show.As', 'said', 'movie', 'real', 'flavor', 'taste', 'have', 'aquire', 'first', 'eating', 'up']",Funland VHS
256151,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,6301569229,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[1, 1]","My, my, my, where do I start?  I guess I will note how I came across Funland. My girlfriend knows I love cheesy horror movies so she bought Funland, as a Christmas gift.  She had no knowledge of this movie and bought it on a whim.  Once I watched it, I questioned if she really liked me or not.  I mean if you want to break up with a guy cheat on him, or steal his car you don't have to give him this movie on DVD.As for the movie, not sure how to categorize it, is it a horror or a comedy?  The movie centers around a clown named Bruce Burger, played by David Ladner (Laverne & Shirley's Squiggy).  Basically, Bruce Burger is the mascot of Funland and he is having a hard time separating his life and the character he is playing.  Bruce Burger also talks to ""people who aren't there"", like a dead co-worker, Humphrey Bogart and Marilyn Monroe.  Then there is his puppet Peter Pepperoni, which Bruce Burger carries full on conversations with.  Every time I heard the name Peter Pepperoni and saw the puppet, I was laughing so hard I couldn't stand it.  The theme song called ""Funland"", is also painful, ""Mama please take me to Funland....."" Once I hear this song, I wanted to be fed rat droppings.This movie is 1980's cheese at its best or worst.  I wouldn't say it is a horror movie and it really isn't a comedy.  My best bet is to call it a satire, but it is still lame.  This movie might have been praised better if it was promoted differently.  Funland has the potential to be a nasty little horror film, but nothing ever seems to happen.  It just runs out of gas.  If you like to see Bruce Burger A.K.A Squiggy flip his lid, go for it.  If you want to use Bruce Burger A.K.A Squiggy as a case study for delusions, dissociative identity disorder and/or schizophrenia, you might have a winner.  Otherwise, this could be viewed as one of the worst movies ever made.  Also, I don't even know why the clown's name is Bruce Burger when he is dressed like a slice of pizza.  The only scary part about this movie isn't that someone wrote the screenplay, but that someone produced it into a movie. Oh and if you are wondering if the theme park that is being used is Six Flags over Atlanta, Georgia you are correct. I have been to that park; I can't believe I am linked to Funland.",1,"""Mama please take me to Funland"" - Peter Pepperoni",1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,2276,"['where', 'do', 'start', 'guess', 'will', 'note', 'how', 'came', 'Funland', 'girlfriend', 'love', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'movies', 'bought', 'Funland', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'had', 'knowledge', 'movie', 'bought', 'whim', 'Once', 'watched', 'questioned', 'really', 'liked', 'not', 'mean', 'want', 'break', 'up', 'guy', 'cheat', 'steal', 'car', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'give', 'movie', 'DVD.As', 'movie', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'categorize', 'horror', 'comedy', 'movie', 'centers', 'clown', 'named', 'Bruce', 'Burger', 'played', 'David', 'Ladner', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'Squiggy', 'Basically', 'Bruce', 'Burger', 'mascot', 'Funland', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'separating', 'life', 'character', 'playing', 'Bruce', 'Burger', 'also', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'dead', 'co-worker', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Then', 'puppet', 'Peter', 'Pepperoni', 'Bruce', 'Burger', 'full', 'conversations', 'Every', 'time', 'heard', 'name', 'Peter', 'Pepperoni', 'saw', 'puppet', 'was', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'theme', 'song', 'called', 'Funland', 'also', 'painful', 'Mama', 'please', 'take', 'Funland', '..', 'Once', 'hear', 'song', 'wanted', 'be', 'fed', 'rat', 'droppings.This', 'movie', '1980', 'cheese', 'best', 'worst', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'horror', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'best', 'bet', 'call', 'satire', 'still', 'lame', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'praised', 'better', 'was', 'promoted', 'differently', 'Funland', 'potential', 'be', 'nasty', 'little', 'horror', 'film', 'nothing', 'ever', 'happen', 'just', 'gas', 'like', 'see', 'Bruce', 'Burger', 'A.K.A', 'Squiggy', 'flip', 'lid', 'go', 'want', 'use', 'Bruce', 'Burger', 'A.K.A', 'Squiggy', 'case', 'study', 'delusions', 'dissociative', 'identity', 'disorder', 'and/or', 'schizophrenia', 'might', 'have', 'winner', 'Otherwise', 'could', 'be', 'viewed', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'why', 'clown', 'name', 'Bruce', 'Burger', 'when', 'dressed', 'slice', 'pizza', 'only', 'scary', 'part', 'movie', ""n't"", 'someone', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'someone', 'produced', 'movie', 'Oh', 'are', 'wondering', 'theme', 'park', 'being', 'used', 'Six', 'Flags', 'Atlanta', 'Georgia', 'are', 'correct', 'have', 'been', 'park', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'am', 'linked', 'Funland']",Funland VHS
