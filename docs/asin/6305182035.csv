453424,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6305182035,Dr. James Gardner,"[0, 0]","Switchback is a 1997 thriller that offers great performances and excellent scenery, but a plot with holes so big you could drive a train through them. The good news first -Dennis Quaid is terrific as the buttoned down FBI agent who is doing his best to control his rage and impotence as he hunts the serial killer who has eluded him for months and recently killed his sister-in-law and abducted his son. Quaid has made a good career out of being the charming guy next door in films like ""The Right Stuff"" (1983), ""The Parent Trap"" (1998), ""Frequency"" (2000), and  my favorite Quaid flick - ""The Big Easy"" (1987). So it's refreshing to see a good actor stretch his limits and he does so admirably.Jared Leto plays one of two possible suspects. Leto has appeared in 20 films since 1994. He played the title role in the docudrama about the long distance runner ""Prefontaine"" (1997), a heroin addict in ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000), and John Lennon's killed in ""Chapter 27"" (2007).R. Lee Emery almost always puts in a great performance, and he doesn't let us down in this film. In more than 100 films since 1978, Emery is probably best known for ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987), a role he was originally hired to be technical advisor for, but Kubrick had the good sense to put him in front of the camera. In addition to his busy film career, Emery hosts two TV shows - ""Mail Call"" and ""Lock n' Load"" - both of them with a military basis reflected his 10 year career as a Marine.Ted Levine plays Emery's devoted deputy. You'll remember Levine from his unforgettable role as ""Buffalo Bill"" in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) and TV fans will known him as the ever fretting Captain Stottlemeyer who puts up with the antics of his obsessive consultant ""Monk"". Levine leads an active career averaging one film a year and includes roles in ""Shutter Island"" (2010), ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (2004), ""Fast and the Furious"" (2000), etc.William Fitchner is a face you'll recognize even if you don't recall his name. He's appeared in more than 50 films and had recurring roles on ""Grace under Fire"" as Ryan Sparks (1994-5), ""MDs"" as Dr. Kellerman (2002), ""Invasion"" as Sheriff Tom Underlay (2005-6), ""Prison Break"" as Alex Mahone (2006-9), and ""Entourage"" as Phil Yagoda (2009-10). He plays another law enforcement official in an election race against Emery. His role is brief but he does his usual effective job.Walton Googins has a small role as a deputy. Googins is best known as the agonized and ultimately ill fated detective Shane Vendrell from the great TV  series ""The Shield"" (2002-8) and the born again Boyd Crowder from ""Justified"" (2010-11). His considerable talents are wasted in the small role he plays, but it's always good to see an actor at an early stage in  his career. This was his fourth film.The film is written, directed, and produced by Jeb Stuart. Stuart started ""in the biz"" as the screenwriter for ""Die Hard"" (1988) and then wrote a string of hits including ""Another 48 Hrs"" (1990) and ""The Fugitive"" (1993). This gave him the credits to move to producer which he did for the box office and critical clunker ""Fire Down Below"" (1997) and producer director for this film. Stuart's progression is clear evidence for the existence of the Peter principle ""in the biz"". The plot has so many holes in it, and unbelievable coincidences, and unlikely events, that it's really hard to watch. Only the fine performances from the cast and the beautiful scenery will keep you attracted to the screen.Like ""Fire Down Below"", ""Switchback"" was a commercial failure, costing $37,000,000 to make and grossing a mere $2.7 million on the opening weekend. More than ten years would go by before Stuart had another project to make it to the screen.",2,"Fine performances, dumb plot",1290038400,"11 18, 2010",2010,3737,"['Switchback', '1997', 'thriller', 'great', 'performances', 'excellent', 'scenery', 'plot', 'holes', 'so', 'big', 'could', 'drive', 'train', 'good', 'news', 'first', '-Dennis', 'Quaid', 'terrific', 'buttoned', 'down', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'doing', 'best', 'control', 'rage', 'impotence', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'eluded', 'months', 'recently', 'killed', 'sister-in-law', 'abducted', 'son', 'Quaid', 'made', 'good', 'career', 'being', 'charming', 'guy', 'next', 'door', 'films', 'Right', 'Stuff', '1983', 'Parent', 'Trap', '1998', 'Frequency', '2000', 'favorite', 'Quaid', 'flick', 'Big', 'Easy', '1987', 'refreshing', 'see', 'good', 'actor', 'stretch', 'limits', 'so', 'admirably.Jared', 'Leto', 'one', 'two', 'possible', 'suspects', 'Leto', 'appeared', '20', 'films', '1994', 'played', 'title', 'role', 'docudrama', 'long', 'distance', 'runner', 'Prefontaine', '1997', 'heroin', 'addict', 'Requiem', 'Dream', '2000', 'John', 'Lennon', 'killed', 'Chapter', '27', '2007', '.R', 'Lee', 'Emery', 'almost', 'always', 'great', 'performance', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'film', 'more', '100', 'films', '1978', 'Emery', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', '1987', 'role', 'was', 'originally', 'hired', 'be', 'technical', 'advisor', 'Kubrick', 'had', 'good', 'sense', 'put', 'front', 'camera', 'addition', 'busy', 'film', 'career', 'Emery', 'two', 'TV', 'shows', 'Mail', 'Call', 'Lock', 'n', 'Load', 'military', 'basis', 'reflected', '10', 'year', 'career', 'Marine.Ted', 'Levine', 'Emery', 'devoted', 'deputy', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'Levine', 'unforgettable', 'role', 'Buffalo', 'Bill', 'Silence', 'Lambs', '1991', 'TV', 'fans', 'will', 'known', 'ever', 'fretting', 'Captain', 'Stottlemeyer', 'who', 'up', 'antics', 'obsessive', 'consultant', 'Monk', 'Levine', 'active', 'career', 'averaging', 'one', 'film', 'year', 'roles', 'Shutter', 'Island', '2010', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', '2004', 'Fast', 'Furious', '2000', 'etc.William', 'Fitchner', 'face', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'name', 'appeared', 'more', '50', 'films', 'had', 'recurring', 'roles', 'Grace', 'Fire', 'Ryan', 'Sparks', '1994-5', 'MDs', 'Dr.', 'Kellerman', '2002', 'Invasion', 'Sheriff', 'Tom', 'Underlay', '2005-6', 'Prison', 'Break', 'Alex', 'Mahone', '2006-9', 'Entourage', 'Phil', 'Yagoda', '2009-10', 'law', 'enforcement', 'official', 'election', 'race', 'Emery', 'role', 'brief', 'usual', 'effective', 'job.Walton', 'Googins', 'small', 'role', 'deputy', 'Googins', 'best', 'known', 'agonized', 'ultimately', 'ill', 'fated', 'detective', 'Shane', 'Vendrell', 'great', 'TV', 'series', 'Shield', '2002-8', 'born', 'again', 'Boyd', 'Crowder', 'Justified', '2010-11', 'considerable', 'talents', 'are', 'wasted', 'small', 'role', 'always', 'good', 'see', 'actor', 'early', 'stage', 'career', 'was', 'fourth', 'film.The', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'produced', 'Jeb', 'Stuart', 'Stuart', 'started', 'biz', 'screenwriter', 'Die', 'Hard', '1988', 'then', 'wrote', 'string', 'hits', 'including', '48', 'Hrs', '1990', 'Fugitive', '1993', 'gave', 'credits', 'move', 'producer', 'did', 'box', 'office', 'critical', 'clunker', 'Fire', 'Down', 'Below', '1997', 'producer', 'director', 'film', 'Stuart', 'progression', 'clear', 'evidence', 'existence', 'Peter', 'principle', 'biz', 'plot', 'so', 'many', 'holes', 'unbelievable', 'coincidences', 'unlikely', 'events', 'really', 'hard', 'watch', 'Only', 'fine', 'performances', 'cast', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'will', 'keep', 'attracted', 'screen.Like', 'Fire', 'Down', 'Below', 'Switchback', 'was', 'commercial', 'failure', 'costing', '37,000,000', 'make', 'grossing', 'mere', '2.7', 'million', 'opening', 'weekend', 'More', 'ten', 'years', 'would', 'go', 'Stuart', 'had', 'project', 'make', 'screen']",N/A

453439,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,6305182035,Michael Butts,"[11, 11]","SWITCHBACK is a good movie.  I felt it had some great suspense scenes and the climax is a different one.  Director Jeb Stuart has orchestrated some beautiful snow shots, and utilizes the special effects quite well.  The main problem with the movie is Dennis Quaid's performance.  I have enjoyed many of Quaid's roles, particularly in &quot;Frequency&quot; and &quot;Innerspace.&quot;  In this one, however, his stoic, emotionless FBI agent is so wooden and lifeless that I didn't find myself sympathizing with him on the kidnapping of his child nor his quest to find the serial killer.  Danny Glover, however, is superb.  He demonstrates a wide range of emotions, and even though you know where his role is going to take him, it's a pleasure going along for the ride. The suspense he creates in the scene in the convenience store is acutely eeerie.  Jared Leto is okay as the mysterious hitchhiker, but a little more sinister behavior could have enhanced the mystery.  William Frichtner as the newly elected sheriff did a commendable job with his underwritten role. (He was also excellent in &quot;Perfect Storm.&quot;).  This is the first movie I liked R. Lee Ermey.  Usually playing the redneck villian, he gets a chance to play a redneck good guy and he seems to relish the change.  Ted Levine, the bad guy from &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; plays Ermey's deputy with such downhome fervor, he too emerges a winner in the casting department.  Basil Polodorous' score was also effective.  Not a classic, but it deserved more than it got on its initial release; just wish Quaid had been directed differently.RECOMMENDED.",4,GLOVER'S FILM,1068336000,"11 9, 2003",2003,1623,"['SWITCHBACK', 'good', 'movie', 'felt', 'had', 'great', 'suspense', 'scenes', 'climax', 'different', 'one', 'Director', 'Jeb', 'Stuart', 'orchestrated', 'beautiful', 'snow', 'shots', 'special', 'effects', 'quite', 'well', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'performance', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'Quaid', 'roles', 'particularly', 'quot', 'Frequency', 'quot', 'quot', 'Innerspace.', 'quot', 'one', 'however', 'stoic', 'emotionless', 'FBI', 'agent', 'so', 'wooden', 'lifeless', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'sympathizing', 'kidnapping', 'child', 'quest', 'find', 'serial', 'killer', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'however', 'superb', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions', 'even', 'know', 'where', 'role', 'going', 'take', 'pleasure', 'going', 'along', 'ride', 'suspense', 'scene', 'convenience', 'store', 'acutely', 'eeerie', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'okay', 'mysterious', 'hitchhiker', 'little', 'more', 'sinister', 'behavior', 'could', 'have', 'enhanced', 'mystery', 'William', 'Frichtner', 'newly', 'elected', 'sheriff', 'did', 'commendable', 'job', 'underwritten', 'role', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'quot', 'Perfect', 'Storm.', 'quot', 'first', 'movie', 'liked', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermey', 'Usually', 'playing', 'redneck', 'villian', 'chance', 'play', 'redneck', 'good', 'guy', 'relish', 'change', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'bad', 'guy', 'quot', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'quot', 'Ermey', 'deputy', 'such', 'downhome', 'fervor', 'too', 'winner', 'casting', 'department', 'Basil', 'Polodorous', 'score', 'was', 'also', 'effective', 'Not', 'classic', 'deserved', 'more', 'got', 'initial', 'release', 'just', 'wish', 'Quaid', 'had', 'been', 'directed', 'differently.RECOMMENDED']",N/A
