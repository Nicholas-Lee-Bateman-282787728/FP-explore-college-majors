839808,A18BD98SU49UB7,B0002LJTF4,"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H.""","[2, 3]","Kaena: the Prophecy has been created amidst a world that is both alien, and familiar.A lost ""sphere"" of energy creates an entire civilation for itself because it is lonely. This habitat is a tree-like entity that spans for miles into the atmosphere and is inhabited on both ends. On the upper end lives a colony of peaceful yet semi-ignorant tree dwellers which spend their day-to-day lives harvesting grub-worms and tapping sap. They accumulate the sap then ritually offer it to their gods, which are supposedly offering protection. Think Hoppers Gang from Bugs Life.At the lower depths are the villains, which we learn very quickly as the movie progresses.Kaena is a young girl who lives with the upper tree dwellers. She is the free-spirited free-thinker of the nation. The only one, or atleast willing to admit it. Her entire life has been spent in the exploration of the lower depths, and knows surely something else must be down there. Thus, when her life is threatened, off she goes.Some were wondering why this received a pg-13 rating. Technically the rating is a bit harsh, but there is some terror and violence with a pretty obvious forced ""mating"" ritual between the creatures of the lower realm. But I think a mature minded ten or eleven year old would have no trouble sitting through it, if mom and pop approve.I liked this film for several reasons: First, although many plot elements can be attained in many other movies, this one has its own uniqueness. I was willing to go along for the ride, and with every step I found myself wanting more... even after the conclusion, take that as you will. Secondly, I like the idea of a group of game software engineers throwing their know-how together and formulating an above average movie on a shoe-string budget. Kudos and a bag of popcorn to those guys.Kaena is a well made project for folks who like to visit ""strange new worlds"" in lands ""far far away.""",3,Well Done,1114387200,"04 25, 2005",2005,1914,"['Kaena', 'Prophecy', 'been', 'created', 'world', 'alien', 'lost', 'sphere', 'energy', 'creates', 'entire', 'civilation', 'lonely', 'habitat', 'tree-like', 'entity', 'miles', 'atmosphere', 'inhabited', 'ends', 'upper', 'end', 'colony', 'peaceful', 'yet', 'semi-ignorant', 'tree', 'dwellers', 'spend', 'day-to-day', 'lives', 'harvesting', 'grub-worms', 'tapping', 'sap', 'accumulate', 'sap', 'then', 'ritually', 'offer', 'gods', 'are', 'supposedly', 'offering', 'protection', 'Think', 'Hoppers', 'Gang', 'Bugs', 'Life.At', 'lower', 'depths', 'are', 'villains', 'learn', 'very', 'quickly', 'movie', 'progresses.Kaena', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'upper', 'tree', 'dwellers', 'free-spirited', 'free-thinker', 'nation', 'only', 'one', 'atleast', 'willing', 'admit', 'entire', 'life', 'been', 'spent', 'exploration', 'lower', 'depths', 'surely', 'something', 'else', 'must', 'be', 'there', 'Thus', 'when', 'life', 'threatened', 'goes.Some', 'were', 'wondering', 'why', 'received', 'pg-13', 'rating', 'Technically', 'rating', 'bit', 'harsh', 'terror', 'violence', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'forced', 'mating', 'ritual', 'creatures', 'lower', 'realm', 'think', 'mature', 'minded', 'ten', 'eleven', 'year', 'old', 'would', 'have', 'trouble', 'sitting', 'mom', 'pop', 'approve.I', 'liked', 'film', 'several', 'reasons', 'First', 'many', 'plot', 'elements', 'can', 'be', 'attained', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'one', 'own', 'uniqueness', 'was', 'willing', 'go', 'along', 'ride', 'step', 'found', 'wanting', 'more', 'even', 'conclusion', 'take', 'will', 'Secondly', 'like', 'idea', 'group', 'game', 'software', 'engineers', 'throwing', 'know-how', 'together', 'formulating', 'above', 'average', 'movie', 'shoe-string', 'budget', 'Kudos', 'bag', 'popcorn', 'guys.Kaena', 'well', 'made', 'project', 'folks', 'who', 'like', 'visit', 'strange', 'new', 'worlds', 'lands', 'far', 'far', 'away']",N/A
839809,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0002LJTF4,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 16]","I had so much hope for this film.  I remember seeing the previews and thinking that this was going to be an amazing film filled with beautiful visuals and a groundbreaking and imaginative story.  Well, I can honestly say that I was only half-right.  This was a classic example of a movie that had the potential to stand out and become a force in the computer animated film genre, but instead fell short because it lacked in story and strong characters.  With both of these lacking considerably, it was impossible to fully enjoy the perfect surroundings and surreal imagination (which was not missing from this film at all).  Instead, what this film boiled down to was a fairly well endowed girl fighting to save her people from these sap creatures that wanted nothing more than to destroy a blue orb that they felt destroyed their people and planet.  With all of this destroying and cross-referencing happening, it became obvious on how the directors lost track of their original target and instead found themselves all over the cinematic CGI-created map.So, let's begin with the characters.  Our heroine, Kaena, was horribly voiced by Kirsten Dunst giving us this modernized voice for a very primitive character.  I kept waiting to hear her say ""whatever"" and get on her cell phone.  The voice behind Kaena gave no depth to the characters or the surroundings.  Everytime she opened her mouth I kept cringing in my seat wondering why so much was spent on this mismatched voice.  The only one that was worth listening to was Richard Harris who did a superb job behind Opaz, giving the right amount of age and wisdom to make us feel sympathy and delight for this strange creature.  The rest were pure rubbish.  They were all underdeveloped and uncared for which just pushed the overall tone for this film into disgust.  I cared nothing for the villagers or even the villains.  The reason, I knew nothing about them.  How did these villagers evolve and why?  Within a time of 600 years, the tree had inhabitants like humans, did anyone else find this odd.  Also, who were the sap monsters?  The lighting gave no accurate description and they gave us nothing to build on.  Were they evil just to be evil?  Somebody help me here!  This apparent lack of development forced the ending to be nothing but dribble filled with sap and forced emotions.It became apparent about the middle of this film that the directors had jumped in way over their heads.  They had built a world too big for them to handle or fully develop.  With so much happening in this film and so many ""new"" characters, I couldn't devote my attention to any specific one.  Every scene gave us a new visual, and that may work in some films, but for Kaena it just gave us something new to see without any form of explanation.  Who were the other inhabitants of the tree and why did they just show up randomly?  How could the sap monsters control some and yet not others?  What was the connection between all of these characters?  My answer to this last question was that there wasn't any.  The directors forced too much onto this film causing the pure basics of filmmaking to be lost.  You will find when watching this film that scenes come uneven, fades between them are chaotic, and you never quite know where you will end up next.  This creates a sense of uncertainty with the film that should not have been evident.  This was no Final Fantasy, but instead an uneven wanna-be that had the potential, but never explored it.  Kaena felt like that project that you had two weeks to work on, but somehow find yourself working on it the night before.  The whole film seemed like a visual procrastination.I will give credit to one aspect of this film that I thought was enjoyable and that was the CGI graphics.  I don't know who they had working on their team, but there were some beautiful moments to this film.  Not all of it was above par, but there were just scenes that would linger in your mind for days.  There also seemed like there were moments when the CGI would transform into regular animation for a brief second or so, I don't know if it was intentional or part of the story, but for me it worked.  If the film would have combined these two styles, I think they would have had a stronger story.  The dream sequences were some of the most creative I have seen in film lately.  I was impressed of the visuals, but as I said before, the poor characters and story overshadowed them.Overall, this film could have been great.  The imagination behind the story is there, almost on the tip of its tongue, but gets lost somewhere when too much food is forced into the mouth of the story and characters.  I really wanted to enjoy this film, but I just couldn't get past this.  The voices were mismatched and the story was just too overwhelming.  I needed better voice actors and a better-knitted story.  Also, perhaps if Kaena's breasts were just a bit less I could have appreciated her character a bit more.  Whew, those were unnecessary unless the directors of his film were targeting young boys.  They were, like the story, a bit too overwhelming.Grade: ** out of *****",2,Over imagination creates ultimate failure!,1100563200,"11 16, 2004",2004,5130,"['had', 'so', 'much', 'hope', 'film',

839810,AK3DTNDKJ9N0I,B0002LJTF4,"Amazon Customer ""KingNot""","[1, 2]","It's like one of the better ""Heavy Metal"" magazine stories fully animated with CG but done so well the artist's work is not diminished.  And, it was done with 1/10-1/100th the resources anyone else would have used.  They actually used mostly public domain software, writing new scripts as they went along.These guys are awesome.  Like I said, though the film has high themes of skepticism against religions (certainly dogmatic ignorance) it is ""God"" to CG stuff.  Even though I've seen it, I just bought a copy.I'm getting Z-Brush with my tax return and I want to watch and watch this for a standard of 'excellence' to strive for with every project.Now, for those who have other hobbys than creating animation renders and digital art through their computers, I still reccomend this film.  As far as a sci-fi fantasy goes, it is very good, bordering on excellent.  This movie is almost ""Fully realized"" and so unlike other CG's it won't become 'dated' as increased computer capabilities make what was hard become easy.  And, really, if one wanted to do it live action with an unlimited budget (can you say ""Waterworld"", boys and girls, I knew you could;-) it wouldn't be any better.I'd even say it was a good movie to let a kid in their early teens see. (""Things to come"" is the best)  Don't let the 'heavy metal' thing scare you, it's not 'dirty' and sure the main character is hot, but that element is made to appreciate beauty, not porn.

One of my biggest surprises was how great Kirsten Dunst's voice acting is in this film. She's required to say some pretty crazy sci-fi dialogue & she manages to make it all seem quite natural & believable. Perhaps Kirsten should overdub Natalie Portman's dialogue in the Star Wars prequel special editions.

839812,A2BHRZHZONOXSU,B0002LJTF4,"Brian T ""The Coolest Movies""","[9, 12]","Scepticism and religion collide head-on in this fantastic, perceptive computer-animated fantasy, a France-Canada co-production.Originally shown in France in 3-D (and apparently initiated as a video game), the film pulls no punches in advocating science and reason over empty spiritualism in an age of unquestioning belief in things that cannot be proven or seen. It's staggering that such an approach can be taken in an animated feature aimed as much at young kids as it is at adults. One imagines such a film could only be made in a country that knows what sacrifices must be made in order to achieve any kind of true enlightenment. It's doubtful any American animators could have produced a project so willing to confront very importtant issues in a fantasy milieu.The film is set in an otherworldly forest structure called Axis in which a human tribe virtually lives to harvest the sap of the trees to appease their Gods. Only one, an adventurous 17-year-old girl named Kaena (voiced by Kirsten Dunst/Cecile De France), dares to defy ancestral tradition (which is largely comprised of work and worship) to seek the truth when the gods declare their anger at the decreasing returns of the harvest and start threatening destruction. She knows something's not right, and eventually finds evidence (with the help of some creepy-cute evolved worms) that these Gods are nothing more than a malevolent but superior liquid race called Selenites (who themselves are being used by an even higher power), yet the tribal High Priest, who has unwittingly turned everyone into peons working for this much more sinister force, believes that every ill that befalls the tribe is a punishment from the gods and that only prayer will provided the answers.There's a crucial scene about 46 minutes into the film where the high priest is seen despairing for answers (which, of course, are not forthcoming, and never have been) and then, with little sense of responsibility, turns around and lies to a questioning villager that God has given him good news: they've passed the final test in a series and are now free to join their maker in a mindless group suicide. Thus, Kaena's struggle to learn the truth - and what lies beyond the clouds that surround Axis - suddenly has a deadline if she's to save her people from literally destroying themselves over their beliefs.The CG design work in this film is stunning and quite unlike anything undertaken in either the U.S. or Asia to date, although FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRITS WITHIN could be considered a close artistic cousin; the visual and aural effect is quite enveloping within the first few minutes. The human characters are slightly exaggerated (along the lines of, say, King Farquahd (?) in Shrek, but far less intentionally comical) and the lead character exudes a vibrant sexuality (check out that chamois bikini get-up on the package) unseen in American animated characters beyond the grotesque amazonian vixens of the HEAVY METAL films. It should come as no surprise that the film lists legendary comic book writer Alexandro Jodorowski as a consultant (if I recall correctly).The production design, from the lush brown palatte of Axis to the slick, blue-black interiors of Vechanoy, the sentient spaceship that once housed the forerunners of the human tribesmen, is stunningly ""realistic"" and must have been a pip in 3-D.Despite the elaborate trappings (and an occasionally tricky plot structure), at its core KAENA: THE PROPHECY is rather daring indictment of organized religion and its continued inability to definitively answer the Really Big Questions, as well as mankind's continued tendency to need answers to such quandaries (hey, it's all in the film, folks!). It's a colourful reminder that we're often better off thinking for ourselves.

I was also surprised to learn that the film was French, but shouldn't have been after viewing it as ""Kaena: The Prophecy"" makes little sense to its audience.The film, directed by Chris Delaporte and Pascal Pinon who originally wanted to make a video game, opens promisingly with the spectacular crash landing of a space ship.  The camera sweeps through the various levels of the ship, showing the passengers running for their lives as it explodes.  The film loses steam afterwards, as if the filmmakers put all their effort in the first few minutes in order to fool the audiences into thinking they hadn't wasted their money.  The story concerns the young girl Kaena (voiced by Kirsten Dunst) who is a member of group who spends their days collecting tree sap for the Old Gods.  The Old Gods are actually a more powerful species who thrive on the sap and are concerned that their supply is running out.  Kaena doesn't believe that the Old Gods are as all-powerful as the local prophet preaches, and decides to find out for herself.That's pretty much what I got out of the plot.  Along the way, Kaena talks to some comic-relief worm aliens that help guide her and fights some generic-looking monsters with big teeth and no eyes.  There's also a sub-plot involving a conspiracy to overthrow the leader of the Old Gods through some kind of weird, sexual melding.The visuals of the film fare a little better than the plot does, but not by much.  The characters look very cartoony, similar to the characters from ""Antz"".  Every shot looks either very brown or so crowded with what I can only guess the filmmakers considered detail that it's difficult to tell what's going on.  There's a lot of running and jumping around in trees, so the camera moves around pretty quick.  There are also scenes that slowdown, but I'm not sure if this was done for effect or because the CGI was screwed up.  The design of Kaena's world is beautiful during the wide shots and the filmmakers do a good job of making her world seem big, even though most of the movie takes place in a tree.  The voice acting is quite excellent too.  I couldn't really tell that the movie was dubbed over from French to English and Dunst, along with Angelica Huston and the late Richard Harris, does a fine job with the dialogue.Those looking for a more mature CGI film instead of ""Finding Nemo"" should wait for something else to come along.  With a slow, confusing plot and bland visuals, ""Kaena: The Prophecy"" is a big disappointment to animation fans.RATING:  D or 2 out of 5 stars",2,"THIS IS ONE ""PROPHECY"" NOT WORTH MENTIONING",1095033600,"09 13, 2004",2004,2735,"['Seeing', 'how', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'moneymaker', 'was', 'glad', 'learn', 'Columbia/Tri-Star', 'was', 'still', 'willing', 'release', 'CGI', 'feature', 'was', ""n't"", 'aimed', 'directly', 'small', 'children', 'was', 'also', 'surprised', 'learn', 'film', 'was', 'French', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'viewing', 'Kaena', 'Prophecy', 'little', 'sense', 'audience.The', 'film', 'directed', 'Chris', 'Delaporte', 'Pascal', 'Pinon', 'who', 'originally', 'wanted', 'make', 'video', 'game', 'promisingly', 'spectacular', 'crash', 'landing', 'space', 'ship', 'camera', 'various', 'levels', 'ship', 'showing', 'passengers', 'running', 'lives', 'film', 'steam', 'afterwards', 'filmmakers', 'put', 'effort', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'order', 'fool', 'audiences', 'thinking', 'had', ""n't"", 'wasted', 'money', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'Kaena', 'voiced', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'member', 'group', 'who', 'days', 'collecting', 'tree', 'sap', 'Old', 'Gods', 'Old', 'Gods', 'are', 'actually', 'more', 'powerful', 'species', 'who', 'thrive', 'sap', 'are', 'concerned', 'supply', 'running', 'out', 'Kaena', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Old', 'Gods', 'are', 'as', 'all-powerful', 'local', 'prophet', 'preaches', 'find', 'out', 'herself.That', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'got', 'out', 'plot', 'way', 'Kaena', 'talks', 'comic-relief', 'worm', 'help', 'guide', 'fights', 'generic-looking', 'monsters', 'big', 'teeth', 'eyes', 'also', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'conspiracy', 'overthrow', 'leader', 'Old', 'Gods', 'kind', 'weird', 'sexual', 'melding.The', 'visuals', 'film', 'fare', 'little', 'better', 'plot', 'not', 'much', 'characters', 'look', 'very', 'cartoony', 'similar', 'characters', 'Antz', 'shot', 'very', 'brown', 'so', 'crowded', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'filmmakers', 'considered', 'detail', 'difficult', 'tell', 'what', 'going', 'lot', 'running', 'jumping', 'around', 'trees', 'camera', 'around', 'pretty', 'quick', 'are', 'also', 'scenes', 'slowdown', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'done', 'effect', 'CGI', 'was', 'screwed', 'up', 'design', 'Kaena', 'world', 'beautiful', 'wide', 'shots', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'world', 'seem', 'big', 'even', 'most', 'movie', 'place', 'tree', 'voice', 'acting', 'quite', 'excellent', 'too', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'movie', 'was', 'dubbed', 'French', 'English', 'Dunst', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'late', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'fine', 'job', 'dialogue.Those', 'looking', 'more', 'mature', 'CGI', 'film', 'instead', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'should', 'wait', 'something', 'else', 'come', 'along', 'slow', 'confusing', 'plot', 'bland', 'visuals', 'Kaena', 'Prophecy', 'big', 'disappointment', 'animation', 'fans.RATING', 'D', '2', '5', 'stars']",N/A

After watching the movie, I felt refreshed and bored at the same time.Focusing on a scientific plot, the world of Axis is the center for the story. Following the main character Kaena, the story envelops the themes of false truths, standing for what you believe in, and enveloping a free future. Obviously being used many times before, I thought this would be another modern repeat of eastern world views. I was actually very surprised by the story.Featuring the voices of Kirsten Dunst (Kaena), Keith David (Sap People), Richard Harris (Opaz), and Angelica Huston (The Queen), the voice emsamble delivers it very nicely. The emotions were definitley apparent but I could not help but think the voice acting of Kirsten Dunst was forced. There were times where it seemed she struggled to present Kaena's character and keep her voice in check.Out of all the ensamble, Keith David's voice stands above all. Being a veteren voice actor from such cartoon series as Gargoyles, Keith David's exquisite voice brings the enemies to life in a fashion hard to master. You cannot help but hate the creatures presented in the movie because his voice acting is so good.The animation of this movie was absolutley astonishing. It is of no question that a lot of work and time went into making this movie. Someone's heart and soul went into itty bitty details and it works. Graphically, I give it a standing ovation.All in all, I would recommend this title to DVD/anime collectors. It is a nice addition and it does play the part for occassional viewings. If a sequel does show itself, I will buy it.

It might help you appreciate the movie when you know that this movie is a massive experiment that just exploded in scope from originally being a video game to following the evolving vision of the project leader into making a full-length film.In case you weren't reading between the lines, this movie was made by demoscene and video game producers and designers, not movie producers. They were newbies at the silver screen. And for that reason alone, it took an incredibly amazing feat to pull this movie off. In fact, this was a seven-year project, and Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within wasn't supposed to happen because these guys were trying desperately to produce the first full-length sci-fi movie in CGI for the silver screen, ever.That said, this is one frickin weird movie. There are scenes here that remind me of the freakshow demos at scene dot org, only here they are played out longer and with much greater depth, color, and detail. I mean that in a good and bad way, both. Anyone who has seen modern PC demos has seen those shapes that look like melted swiss cheese, and somewhere in the middle of it is the shape of a human body. That's the sort of artwork that this movie loves to portray. It's good because it's familiar; I can point at that and say, hey, that's the stereotype work of European 3D demo / game video effects designers. It's bad, too, though, because it's seriously overdone in this film.As a story, the concept was interesting. Unfortunately, the filmmaking directions and the script were lacking. Character development was very dry--probably due to bad acting and unbelievably plastic animation. When Kaena wanted to save her village, for instance, I rolled my eyes, thinking, why? Who cares about the village? The movie also has some very abrupt cutscenes, and the animation does stutter from time to time. The bodies of the characters seemed a little lopsided now and then, and I was immediately reminded of the animation and visual character design work done in the movie Antz--just a little plastic and weird, unlike the characters in The Spirits Within.If you're looking for a good Hollywood flick, overlook this movie, unless of course you're bored. This movie is a piece of museum art, and does not befit the store shelves at Wal-Mart, which is why Wal-Mart will probably sell it for cheap.This movie is a work of art simply because of its background.... you have a bunch of video game developers who had a dream to make a great movie, and it's their first movie, made entirely out of simple video game technology, and look what they achieved!

839826,A1KXLMA9ZD2G12,B0002LJTF4,MaineGirl,"[2, 2]","This visually stunning sci-fi feature was produced in Paris by a team of game-developers, which probably explains the mixed reviews:  Almost everone praises the realistic artwork, but many complain about character and plot, describing the latter as at best unimaginative and at worst confusing and dopey. If you want a clear, linear storyline with all the details neatly spelled out, this is not the movie for you. But if you're looking for sophisticated visuals and are willing to use your imagination to fill in some storyline gaps, I think you'll enjoy Kaena. I know I did.I love good artwork, and here Kaena delivers. This is not the flat, black-outline art of many Japanese animes, rather it has fully 3-dimensional graphics, similar to that seen in Toy Story and Shrek. But forget all the big-eyed Japanese characters and the cutesy stuff Hollywood produces. The French animators have created a visually dense, rich, and vivid tapestry, with all the deep perspective and dramatic chiaroscuro found in the best of modern adult comics. The opening sequence is memorable - you fly like a bird dead on into an oncoming spacecraft that's in the process of breaking apart, travel through the center, then reverse perspective and pass out through the rear just as it blows up.The plot is relatively simple: On an unknown planet called Axis, a mysterious globe contained in the wreckage of the doomed spacecraft has generated a massive branching organic tangle that extends 100 miles into the sky, almost but not quite touching a sister planet hovering nearby. In the midst of this tangle, just above the clouds, a primitive group of people dwells. Their lives consist of little more than harvesting sap from the great plant network and offering it to their gods, who provide them with sustenance. Kaena (Kirsten Dunst) is a rebellious teenager, who prefers exploring and sketching her surroundings to harvesting sap. Her dreams have convinced her that a better existence can be found beyond the cloud layer below, and she's determined to investigate. Her refusal to accept the status quo and the commandments of the High Priest (Richard Harris) get her into trouble, of course. Cast out from her village, she eventually encounters a last survivor of the spacecraft and embarks on a dangerous quest to find the mysterious orb, which holds the key to the fate of Kaena's people and Axis itself.The ""villains"" of the epic are beings that morph from the great pool of sap on Axis. It appears that the very network that gave birth to the humanoids is draining the life-gving fluid from the planet at its roots. For hundreds of years, the Sap Queen (Anjelica Huston) has been trying to destroy the orb, but to no avail. In fact, she's become so obsessed - like Ahab ready to destroy ship and crew in pursuit of Moby Dick - that her vicious attacks on the orb are threatening the existence of her entire race. So there's a little ecology thrown in with the other plot threads of teenage rebellion and a quest for a better existence. I admit it can get a little overwhelming.I agree with some of the comments that there are a few technical flaws in the CG rendering and that Kirsten Dunce's voiceover is mediocre. And for a teenager, Kaena has a body and a skimpy wardrobe that would better do justice to Barbarella or to Frank Frazetta's buxom women. Nevertheless, the visuals and the world they depict are georgeous. As another reviewer put it, there are scenes that will linger in your memory for days. So, if you're looking for a visual feast and can put up with a plot that gets a little clearer as the story unfolds, maybe you should give Kaena a try.",4,A Feast for the Eyes,1111190400,"03 19, 2005",2005,3648,"['visually', 'stunning', 'sci-fi', 'feature', 'was', 'produced', 'Paris', 'team', 'game-developers', 'probably', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'Almost', 'everone', 'realistic', 'artwork', 'many', 'complain', 'character', 'plot', 'describing', 'latter', 'best', 'unimaginative', 'worst', 'confusing', 'dopey', 'want', 'clear', 'linear', 'storyline', 'details', 'neatly', 'spelled', 'out', 'not', 'movie', ""'re"", 'looking', 'sophisticated', 'visuals', 'are', 'willing', 'use', 'imagination', 'fill', 'storyline', 'gaps', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'Kaena', 'know', 'did.I', 'love', 'good', 'artwork', 'here', 'Kaena', 'delivers', 'not', 'flat', 'black-outline', 'art', 'many', 'Japanese', 'animes', 'rather', 'fully', '3-dimensional', 'graphics', 'similar', 'seen', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Shrek', 'forget', 'big-eyed', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'cutesy', 'stuff', 'Hollywood', 'French', 'animators', 'have', 'created', 'visually', 'dense', 'rich', 'vivid', 'tapestry', 'deep', 'perspective', 'dramatic', 'chiaroscuro', 'found', 'best', 'modern', 'adult', 'comics', 'opening', 'sequence', 'memorable', 'fly', 'bird', 'dead', 'oncoming', 'spacecraft', 'process', 'breaking', 'apart', 'travel', 'center', 'then', 'reverse', 'perspective', 'pass', 'out', 'rear', 'just', 'up.The', 'plot', 'relatively', 'simple', 'unknown', 'planet', 'called', 'Axis', 'mysterious', 'globe', 'contained', 'wreckage', 'doomed', 'spacecraft', 'generated', 'massive', 'branching', 'organic', 'tangle', '100', 'miles', 'sky', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'touching', 'sister', 'planet', 'hovering', 'nearby', 'midst', 'tangle', 'just', 'clouds', 'primitive', 'group', 'people', 'dwells', 'lives', 'consist', 'little', 'more', 'harvesting', 'sap', 'great', 'plant', 'network', 'offering', 'gods', 'who', 'provide', 'sustenance', 'Kaena', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'rebellious', 'teenager', 'who', 'exploring', 'sketching', 'surroundings', 'harvesting', 'sap', 'dreams', 'have', 'convinced', 'better', 'existence', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'cloud', 'layer', 'determined', 'investigate', 'refusal', 'accept', 'status', 'quo', 'commandments', 'High', 'Priest', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'get', 'trouble', 'course', 'Cast', 'village', 'eventually', 'last', 'survivor', 'spacecraft', 'embarks', 'dangerous', 'quest', 'find', 'mysterious', 'orb', 'key', 'fate', 'Kaena', 'people', 'Axis', 'itself.The', 'villains', 'epic', 'are', 'beings', 'morph', 'great', 'pool', 'sap', 'Axis', 'very', 'network', 'gave', 'birth', 'humanoids', 'draining', 'life-gving', 'fluid', 'planet', 'roots', 'hundreds', 'years', 'Sap', 'Queen', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'been', 'trying', 'destroy', 'orb', 'avail', 'fact', 'become', 'so', 'obsessed', 'Ahab', 'ready', 'destroy', 'ship', 'crew', 'pursuit', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'vicious', 'attacks', 'orb', 'are', 'threatening', 'existence', 'entire', 'race', 'little', 'ecology', 'thrown', 'other', 'plot', 'threads', 'teenage', 'rebellion', 'quest', 'better', 'existence', 'admit', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'overwhelming.I', 'agree', 'comments', 'are', 'few', 'technical', 'flaws', 'CG', 'rendering', 'Kirsten', 'Dunce', 'voiceover', 'mediocre', 'teenager', 'Kaena', 'body', 'skimpy', 'wardrobe', 'would', 'better', 'do', 'justice', 'Barbarella', 'Frank', 'Frazetta', 'buxom', 'women', 'Nevertheless', 'visuals', 'world', 'depict', 'are', 'georgeous', 'reviewer', 'put', 'are', 'scenes', 'will', 'linger', 'memory', 'days', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'visual', 'feast', 'can', 'put', 'up', 'plot', 'little', 'clearer', 'story', 'unfolds', 'maybe', 'should', 'give', 'Kaena', 'try']",N/A

It has an imaginitive story, good voice acting, and a hauntingly gorgeous world, rich in imagination.The only problem that I found (and the fact that evidently this was originally released in 3-D could very well have something to do with it), is that the visual suffer occasionally...  Sometimes backgrounds and textures 'shimmer' like you'd see in the FMV of a video game, and often the animation is just slightly choppy, again, like a video game.  And while sometimes the actual computer graphics do not look wonderful (not very detailed, even jaggy in a few occasions) other times the visuals are simply jaw-dropping.  The characters are (mostly) extremely detailed, and the environment uses a beautiful color scheme.  In addition, the lighting is gorgeous throughout, perhaps my favorite element of the film.Also, one particular species of characters (""worms"") look as if they stepped right out of the Halo, the game.  Their bodies and the flourescent colors on them look like they are directly from Halo.

839829,AHF97M45JFCB,B0002LJTF4,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","You would certainly be forgiven if 2003's Kaena The Prophecy slipped below your computer animated feature film radar.  I was particularly perplexed why I hadn't heard of it sooner when I discovered that Sony Pictures (under the Columbia Tristar label) distributed this DVD domestically.  The actual film comes to us from a small French firm called Destination Films (Directed by: Chris Delaporte & Pascal Pinon) using software that was actually written for video game development.The film certainly rings of Final Fantasy animated movie inspiration with emphasis on a sort of blend of science fiction and fantasy story elements set in a visually rich world.  However, while the Final Fantasy series may be remembered for its stunning lifelike animation, Kaena (rhymes with hyena) does more with its plotting and prose than it draws gasps for visual perfection (presumably due to budget restrictions and again, a software set that was never intended for the demands of feature film rendering).The story goes something like this: Set in a post-apocalyptic alien world, this tale concerns an adventurous young woman named Kaena (voiced by Kirsten Dunst), a member of a race of humanoids who inhabit an enormous tree called the Axis, rising some hundred miles from the planet surface.Her people's leader, Opaz (Richard Harris), insists the tribe's reason for being is harvesting sap from the ever-dying/ drying tree as offerings to the deities who provide sustenance.  Ever obstinate, Kaena finds herself doubting the teachings of her people in favor of exploring the world around her for answers.The plot really thickens when she discovers that the very existence of her race is credited to an alien space craft that had crashed on the planet some 600 years prior and the idols her people worship are in fact the native race of the planet (the living tree sap Selenites, led by a vicious queen (Anjelica Huston)).If this plot summary sounds intriguing to you, rest assured the actual material is quite impressive.  It flows along with the type of atmosphere one would expect from a science fiction paperback novel coupled to visuals that could best be described as a cross between the imagination of Jim Henson and HR Giger.About the weakest element here would have to be the humans themselves.  Close-up shots of their skin reveal some passable textures but on the whole they animate clunkily and awkwardly.  Bodily movement and hair interaction is reminiscent, of well, a video game cut scene.  But that's hardly surprising all factors considering.I wouldn't go as far as to call the plot structure of Kaena muddled, although it takes a rather non-linear approach to weaving its tale that is commonly found in Japanese anime pieces.  The story is all there but a majority of viewers should not expect to simply blank out in front of the screen and have the material force-fed to them.  Some thought is necessary, especially early on, to make sense of everything being presented.The film has a PG-13 rating and for the most part this recommendation is pretty spot on.  The title character runs around in a skimpy outfit throughout the first half of the picture and there is a brief segment at the end that depicts her fully nude (but tastefully drowned in bright light).  Otherwise there really is no violence/ gore to be concerned with and the dialog is appropriate for all ages.Perhaps the most impressive segment of the picture is a clash between Kaena and a massive sub-terrenes beast called the Marauder.  Flawlessly executed and quite thrilling, it can truly be called the crowning achievement moment of the production.In all, Kaena the Prophecy is a pretty enjoyable experience.  Its modest budget and technical limitations couldn't stop the charm of the storytellers' vision from shining through.  It definitely lacks the polish and all-age-friendliness that we typically associate with domestic CG-based features but it makes up for it with a more enriching, adult-friendly experience.",3,An Honest Modest Production,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,3992,"['would', 'certainly', 'be', 'forgiven', '2003', 'Kaena', 'Prophecy', 'slipped', 'computer', 'animated', 'feature', 'film', 'radar', 'was', 'particularly', 'perplexed', 'why', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'sooner', 'when', 'discovered', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'Columbia', 'Tristar', 'label', 'distributed', 'DVD', 'domestically', 'actual', 'film', 'small', 'French', 'firm', 'called', 'Destination', 'Films', 'Directed', 'Chris', 'Delaporte', 'Pascal', 'Pinon', 'using', 'software', 'was', 'actually', 'written', 'video', 'game', 'development.The', 'film', 'certainly', 'rings', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'animated', 'movie', 'inspiration', 'emphasis', 'sort', 'blend', 'science', 'fiction', 'fantasy', 'story', 'elements', 'set', 'visually', 'rich', 'world', 'However', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'series', 'may', 'be', 'remembered', 'stunning', 'lifelike', 'animation', 'Kaena', 'rhymes', 'hyena', 'more', 'plotting', 'prose', 'gasps', 'visual', 'perfection', 'presumably', 'due', 'budget', 'restrictions', 'again', 'software', 'set', 'was', 'never', 'intended', 'demands', 'feature', 'film', 'rendering', '.The', 'story', 'something', 'Set', 'post-apocalyptic', 'alien', 'world', 'tale', 'adventurous', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Kaena', 'voiced', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'member', 'race', 'humanoids', 'who', 'inhabit', 'enormous', 'tree', 'called', 'Axis', 'rising', 'hundred', 'miles', 'planet', 'surface.Her', 'people', 'leader', 'Opaz', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'tribe', 'reason', 'being', 'harvesting', 'sap', 'ever-dying/', 'drying', 'tree', 'offerings', 'deities', 'who', 'provide', 'sustenance', 'Ever', 'obstinate', 'Kaena', 'doubting', 'teachings', 'people', 'favor', 'exploring', 'world', 'answers.The', 'plot', 'really', 'when', 'very', 'existence', 'race', 'credited', 'alien', 'space', 'craft', 'had', 'crashed', 'planet', '600', 'years', 'prior', 'idols', 'people', 'worship', 'are', 'fact', 'native', 'race', 'planet', 'living', 'tree', 'sap', 'Selenites', 'led', 'vicious', 'queen', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', '.If', 'plot', 'summary', 'sounds', 'intriguing', 'rest', 'assured', 'actual', 'material', 'quite', 'impressive', 'type', 'atmosphere', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'science', 'fiction', 'paperback', 'novel', 'coupled', 'visuals', 'could', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'cross', 'imagination', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'HR', 'Giger.About', 'weakest', 'element', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'humans', 'Close-up', 'shots', 'skin', 'reveal', 'passable', 'textures', 'whole', 'animate', 'clunkily', 'awkwardly', 'Bodily', 'movement', 'hair', 'interaction', 'reminiscent', 'well', 'video', 'game', 'cut', 'scene', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'factors', 'considering.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'call', 'plot', 'structure', 'Kaena', 'muddled', 'rather', 'non-linear', 'approach', 'weaving', 'tale', 'commonly', 'found', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'pieces', 'story', 'there', 'majority', 'viewers', 'should', 'not', 'expect', 'simply', 'blank', 'out', 'front', 'screen', 'have', 'material', 'force-fed', 'thought', 'necessary', 'especially', 'early', 'make', 'sense', 'everything', 'being', 'presented.The', 'film', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'most', 'part', 'recommendation', 'pretty', 'spot', 'title', 'character', 'around', 'skimpy', 'outfit', 'first', 'half', 'picture', 'brief', 'segment', 'end', 'fully', 'nude', 'tastefully', 'drowned', 'bright', 'light', 'really', 'violence/', 'gore', 'be', 'concerned', 'dialog', 'appropriate', 'ages.Perhaps', 'most', 'impressive', 'segment', 'picture', 'clash', 'Kaena', 'massive', 'sub-terrenes', 'beast', 'called', 'Marauder', 'Flawlessly', 'executed', 'quite', 'thrilling', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'called', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'moment', 'production.In', 'Kaena', 'Prophecy', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'modest', 'budget', 'technical', 'limitations', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'charm', 'storytellers', 'vision', 'shining', 'definitely', 'polish', 'all-age-friendliness', 'typically', 'associate', 'domestic', 'CG-based', 'features', 'up', 'more', 'enriching', 'adult-friendly', 'experience']",N/A

It's a must have for people who like to read fantasy magazines.,4,The Australian box artwork looks better,1100131200,"11 11, 2004",2004,413,"['artwork', 'front', 'dvd', 'case', 'too', 'kiddyish', 'almost', 'pasted', 'up', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'movie.You', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'auction', 'web', 'have', 'dvd', 'original', 'box', 'artwork', 'Many', 'foreign', 'countries', 'have', 'original', 'art', 'case', 'lot', 'better', 'American', 'version.The', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'must', 'have', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'read', 'fantasy', 'magazines']",N/A

The plot is horrible and is all over the place, the voice acting is not great and the coloring/lighting/camera angles are all ridiculous.  At parts the camera keeps moving so fast you can hardly tell what's going on. And unless they meant to film the whole thing in SEPHIA and BLUE then it would deserve the 2 stars I am giving it, otherwise it would get a 1 star as if I wanted to see a 1950's style film, I would have watched one.  The Water Creatures may work in a Game, but they definitely don't translate over in DVD form.  I really don't know what to say about how BAD this movie really is, except for that it never should have been made.  If you want to see a really good independent film see Dragon Hunters and compare the difference. If you want to see a really good CGI movie based on a game then see Resident Evil: Regeneration.  This movie is NOT FOR KIDS they will be bored to tears.

839838,AUTBHG6070SL4,B0002LJTF4,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[0, 1]","This movie is sure to have some teen appeal. It's about the lone, rebellious youth, whose rebellion ends up saving everyone. Keana is a strong, young female figure, something the girls might like. She's a rounded, young female figure, something the boys will like. The plot moves well, from the thundering theocrat, to the mysterious foreigner (with comic sidekick), to the slime-lords of the netherworld, to the vital connections between them. The animation is good, the best of today's computer work, and is generally used effectively.The movie has its flaws, though. As you've guessed, it has a formulaic plan that borders on Disney. The animation technology is great, but it's not always used in great ways. Backgrounds are often rich and detailed, something that can work very well. They often create visual clutter that masks the action, however. Some more contrast or depth-of-field effect would have been helpful. The worms, as a group, could have been developed a lot better, and could have engaged a teen's sympathy for those being treated unfairly - that was just an opportunity missed, no matter how close it came. Also, cuts between scenes often went through a silent, black moment. Were those meant as slots for TV ads? I just found the discontinuity jarring.This is good entertainment, but I'm glad I didn't pay movie prices to see it. A younger viewer will probably like it better than I did.//wiredweird",4,"Appealing, but uneven",1107734400,"02 7, 2005",2005,1420,"['movie', 'sure', 'have', 'teen', 'appeal', 'lone', 'rebellious', 'youth', 'rebellion', 'up', 'saving', 'everyone', 'Keana', 'strong', 'young', 'female', 'figure', 'something', 'girls', 'might', 'like', 'rounded', 'young', 'female', 'figure', 'something', 'boys', 'will', 'like', 'plot', 'moves', 'well', 'thundering', 'theocrat', 'mysterious', 'foreigner', 'comic', 'sidekick', 'slime-lords', 'netherworld', 'vital', 'connections', 'animation', 'good', 'best', 'today', 'computer', 'work', 'generally', 'used', 'effectively.The', 'movie', 'flaws', 'though', ""'ve"", 'guessed', 'formulaic', 'plan', 'Disney', 'animation', 'technology', 'great', 'not', 'always', 'used', 'great', 'ways', 'Backgrounds', 'are', 'often', 'rich', 'detailed', 'something', 'can', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'often', 'create', 'visual', 'clutter', 'action', 'however', 'more', 'contrast', 'depth-of-field', 'effect', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'helpful', 'worms', 'group', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'lot', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'engaged', 'teen', 'sympathy', 'being', 'treated', 'unfairly', 'was', 'just', 'opportunity', 'missed', 'matter', 'how', 'close', 'came', 'Also', 'cuts', 'scenes', 'often', 'went', 'silent', 'black', 'moment', 'Were', 'meant', 'slots', 'TV', 'ads', 'just', 'found', 'discontinuity', 'jarring.This', 'good', 'entertainment', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'movie', 'prices', 'see', 'A', 'younger', 'viewer', 'will', 'probably', 'better', 'did.//wiredweird']",N/A
