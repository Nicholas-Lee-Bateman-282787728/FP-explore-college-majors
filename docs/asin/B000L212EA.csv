1036960,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000L212EA,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","A man obsessed with his sisters murder. A man possessed by his murdered sister.Perhaps one of the most ambitious anime series yet, welcome to the anime Le Chevalier D'Eon. An anime combining individuals from French history, religion, horror and mystery.Paris, 1742 and a coffin floats in the shimmering Seine. Written on the coffin are the words ""Psalms"" and inside the coffin is Lia de Beaumont.The story focuses on her brother D'Eon as he tries to find the reason for her mysterious murderer while the shadow of evil rests on the palace of Kings and the dark alleys of Europe.I have no doubt how difficult this anime may have been to translate and to plan out.Having the story set in France during the 1700's and to combine real characters during that era, mixing in religion, possessed zombies, mysticism and horror makes one hell of an anime!With six volumes planned, the first volume focuses on the first four episodes as D'Eon tries to find out why his sister was murdered but the more he looks into it, he learns about the evil that lurks around him.To make things even more confusing to the main character, somehow D'Eon when in battle against the evil forces, gets possessed by his murdered sister.Why this is happening and the secret life that Lia De Beaumont lived is what the first volume focuses on.Obviously ""Le Chevalier D'Eon"" is an anime that is too difficult for me to even describe.All I can say is because the anime focuses on the Rococo era, the costumes, the characters, the secret societies, the use of religion, the mysticm and the horror definitely makes this anime standout.It's definitely unique.The character designs for the anime is something that is fresh.The voice acting for both Japanese and English dubs are done very well.Special features include commentaries with the ADR Director and one of the voice actors (a commentary that has a lot of profanity), an informative commentary by the translators which really go into detail of the challenges they faced, putting together the 20-page booklet with character info & relationships. Also, including a storyboard analysis, script and creator interview.I found it very interesting when they talked about the real D'Eon de Beaumont, although not having a sister in real life, nor possessed but in real life believed he was a woman and lived his life as one in his later life.Special features include historical notes, Japanese promotional video and trailer, clean opening and closing animation and more.All in all, I feel there is a lot of potential with this anime series.Obviously, the first volume is more of a set up for more important things to come in the next volume. So, look at the first volume more as introduction to the characters and situations of the series.I definitely look forward in seeing how this anime progresses.If you are into dark, horror anime or the Rococco era, definitely check this anime out!",4,"If you are into dark, horror anime or the Rococco era, definitely check this anime out!",1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,2901,"['man', 'obsessed', 'sisters', 'murder', 'man', 'possessed', 'murdered', 'sister.Perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'ambitious', 'anime', 'series', 'yet', 'welcome', 'anime', 'Le', 'Chevalier', ""D'Eon"", 'anime', 'combining', 'individuals', 'French', 'history', 'religion', 'horror', 'mystery.Paris', '1742', 'coffin', 'floats', 'shimmering', 'Seine', 'Written', 'coffin', 'are', 'words', 'Psalms', 'coffin', 'Lia', 'Beaumont.The', 'story', 'brother', ""D'Eon"", 'find', 'reason', 'mysterious', 'murderer', 'shadow', 'evil', 'rests', 'palace', 'Kings', 'dark', 'alleys', 'Europe.I', 'have', 'doubt', 'how', 'difficult', 'anime', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'translate', 'plan', 'out.Having', 'story', 'set', 'France', '1700', 'combine', 'real', 'characters', 'era', 'mixing', 'religion', 'possessed', 'zombies', 'mysticism', 'horror', 'one', 'hell', 'anime', 'six', 'volumes', 'planned', 'first', 'volume', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', ""D'Eon"", 'find', 'out', 'why', 'sister', 'was', 'murdered', 'more', 'evil', 'him.To', 'make', 'things', 'even', 'more', 'confusing', 'main', 'character', 'somehow', ""D'Eon"", 'when', 'battle', 'evil', 'forces', 'possessed', 'murdered', 'sister.Why', 'happening', 'secret', 'life', 'Lia', 'De', 'Beaumont', 'lived', 'what', 'first', 'volume', 'on.Obviously', 'Le', 'Chevalier', ""D'Eon"", 'anime', 'too', 'difficult', 'even', 'describe.All', 'can', 'say', 'anime', 'Rococo', 'era', 'costumes', 'characters', 'secret', 'societies', 'use', 'religion', 'mysticm', 'horror', 'definitely', 'anime', 'standout.It', 'definitely', 'unique.The', 'character', 'designs', 'anime', 'something', 'fresh.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'Japanese', 'English', 'dubs', 'are', 'done', 'very', 'well.Special', 'features', 'include', 'commentaries', 'ADR', 'Director', 'one', 'voice', 'actors', 'commentary', 'lot', 'profanity', 'informative', 'commentary', 'translators', 'really', 'go', 'detail', 'challenges', 'faced', 'putting', 'together', '20-page', 'booklet', 'character', 'info', 'relationships', 'Also', 'including', 'storyboard', 'analysis', 'script', 'creator', 'interview.I', 'found', 'very', 'interesting', 'when', 'talked', 'real', ""D'Eon"", 'de', 'Beaumont', 'not', 'having', 'sister', 'real', 'life', 'possessed', 'real', 'life', 'believed', 'was', 'woman', 'lived', 'life', 'one', 'later', 'life.Special', 'features', 'include', 'historical', 'notes', 'Japanese', 'promotional', 'video', 'trailer', 'clean', 'opening', 'closing', 'animation', 'more.All', 'feel', 'lot', 'potential', 'anime', 'series.Obviously', 'first', 'volume', 'more', 'set', 'up', 'more', 'important', 'things', 'come', 'next', 'volume', 'So', 'look', 'first', 'volume', 'more', 'introduction', 'characters', 'situations', 'series.I', 'definitely', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'how', 'anime', 'progresses.If', 'are', 'dark', 'horror', 'anime', 'Rococco', 'era', 'definitely', 'check', 'anime', 'out']",Le Chevalier d'Eon: Psalm of Vengeance

I don't really like French period movies, about the only one I did like was Vatel. But this anime seems to work.And why is it always some kind of evil cult? I admit, I don't know all the specifics, as I haven't seen more than just this DVD, so i don't know what to expect, really. But I rather liked it. Originally, I got it for the voice actors, a couple of which are mine and my daughter's favourites.It has a decent script, and the actors can get the nasal French very well, the animation itself was well done, and the story itself, while seeming to be rather like the formula (big bad dude/company/demon in charge of everything) there are nuances that give it a bit of orginality.The whole thing with being possessed by his sister is weird, but I guess I like weird after all.",4,Why is it always some kind of cult?,1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,815,"['strange', 'like', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'French', 'period', 'movies', 'only', 'one', 'did', 'like', 'was', 'Vatel', 'anime', 'work.And', 'why', 'always', 'kind', 'evil', 'cult', 'admit', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'specifics', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'more', 'just', 'DVD', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'really', 'rather', 'liked', 'Originally', 'got', 'voice', 'actors', 'couple', 'are', 'mine', 'daughter', 'favourites.It', 'decent', 'script', 'actors', 'can', 'get', 'nasal', 'French', 'very', 'well', 'animation', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'story', 'seeming', 'be', 'rather', 'formula', 'big', 'bad', 'dude/company/demon', 'charge', 'everything', 'are', 'nuances', 'give', 'bit', 'orginality.The', 'whole', 'thing', 'being', 'possessed', 'sister', 'weird', 'guess', 'weird']",Le Chevalier d'Eon: Psalm of Vengeance
1036962,A3E5OY3YLZMOA9,B000L212EA,"Keith A. Jones ""Sonic Jones... I'm Kind Of A ...","[3, 5]","In 18th century France, the era of King Louis XV, d'Eon de Beaumont, a member of the secret police is investigating a series of disappearances of young women. After a short period of time while searching a coffin is spotted floating down a river. After investigating the women is identified as d'Eon's sister. The whole scene is weird to d'eon, the word ""PSALMS"" is written on the coffin and there are several more coffins with the same word written on them with young women in them. He sets out on a journey to find the person responsible for doing this but what d'Eon finds is way bigger than he thought. On his journey he is attacked by corpses or gargoyles with the marking  "" H""4 O "" on there heads. He doesn't truly know who to trust and he surely doesn't know where all these clues are leading him.Le Chevalier d'Eon is a very serious and complex anime. Though it comes off boring at first it's actually not. It has great action scenes involving mainly fencing. I do think there could be a couple more of those fencing scenes because they were exciting. There are a lot of them when fighting the gargoyles but the duels between experienced fencers were too cool but there's only a few. I think another villain is needed, like a really crazy villain that you just love to hate. What you'll come to love about this anime is the originalnality it's unlike any anime I've seen. The characters have their own feel and they intrigue you. The beginning and ending music is nice but the music during the anime is not that good. There isn't any suspenseful music to forshadow those creepy gargoyles or any cool action music when some action is going down. The voice acting is fine and fits the characters. Overall this is a good start with few flaws but still a good first volume. I think that the first will surprise people and the second will surpass this first.",4,Long Live d'Eon,1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,1862,"['18th', 'century', 'France', 'era', 'King', 'Louis', 'XV', ""d'Eon"", 'de', 'Beaumont', 'member', 'secret', 'police', 'investigating', 'series', 'disappearances', 'young', 'women', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'searching', 'coffin', 'spotted', 'floating', 'down', 'river', 'investigating', 'women', 'identified', ""d'Eon"", 'sister', 'whole', 'scene', 'weird', ""d'eon"", 'word', 'PSALMS', 'written', 'coffin', 'are', 'several', 'more', 'coffins', 'same', 'word', 'written', 'young', 'women', 'out', 'journey', 'find', 'person', 'responsible', 'doing', 'what', ""d'Eon"", 'finds', 'way', 'bigger', 'thought', 'journey', 'attacked', 'corpses', 'gargoyles', 'marking', 'H', '4', 'O', 'heads', ""n't"", 'truly', 'know', 'who', 'trust', 'surely', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'clues', 'are', 'leading', 'him.Le', 'Chevalier', ""d'Eon"", 'very', 'serious', 'complex', 'anime', 'boring', 'first', 'actually', 'not', 'great', 'action', 'scenes', 'involving', 'mainly', 'fencing', 'do', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'couple', 'more', 'fencing', 'scenes', 'were', 'exciting', 'are', 'lot', 'when', 'fighting', 'gargoyles', 'duels', 'experienced', 'fencers', 'were', 'too', 'cool', 'only', 'few', 'think', 'villain', 'needed', 'really', 'crazy', 'villain', 'just', 'love', 'hate', 'What', ""'ll"", 'come', 'love', 'anime', 'originalnality', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'characters', 'have', 'own', 'feel', 'intrigue', 'beginning', 'ending', 'music', 'nice', 'music', 'anime', 'not', 'good', ""n't"", 'suspenseful', 'music', 'forshadow', 'creepy', 'gargoyles', 'cool', 'action', 'music', 'when', 'action', 'going', 'down', 'voice', 'acting', 'fine', 'characters', 'Overall', 'good', 'start', 'few', 'flaws', 'still', 'good', 'first', 'volume', 'think', 'first', 'will', 'surprise', 'people', 'second', 'will', 'surpass', 'first']",Le Chevalier d'Eon: Psalm of Vengeance
1036963,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B000L212EA,Sesho,"[12, 12]","In 1742 Paris, France, the body of a beautiful young lady is found floating down the Seine River in a coffin with the word ""Psalms"" written on it in blood. Her name is Lia de Beaumont and her brother, D'eon, is the only person that seems to care that she's dead. He's even joined King Louis XV's Secret Police in order to find out the truth behind her murder. At this time France was just beginning to show the undercurrents of a society in revolt against old traditionalist views that would later culminate in a bloody class revolution against the old nobility. Even within the King's own circle are forces that seek to depose him. D'eon thinks that the Duc d'Orleans, the King's uncle, is tied in some way to the death of his sister. d'Orleans also surrounds himself with some pretty creepy characters that are using occult powers to further his wishes. The plot of the show would be pretty good if it stopped at this, but Lia has risen from the dead, Grudge-like, to take her revenge on those that killed her. Though she can no longer animate her own body, she is able to possess her brother, D'Eon, at certain moments of extreme stress, such as when his life is in danger. At that time he loses control of his body and becomes a sword-swinging angel of death. He's going to need her help if he hopes to battle superhuman creatures with mercury flowing in their veins.Le Chevalier D'Eon is a gorgeous piece of anime and unlike so many other shows, the characters and the story are just as interesting as the visuals. You can tell a lot of research went into representing the setting, clothes, and manners of this period in French history. The animation is fluid and graceful, especially in the action sequences such as swordfights. Chevalier has some of the best battles this side of Samurai Champloo. The pacing, too, is masterful, presenting you with interesting diversions but at the same time building the suspense behind the mystery of what exactly happened to Lia. Right now, she is just a cold, calculating, mindless spirit of vengence, but I feel that she will calm down eventually and clue D'Eon in as to what happened to her.
