Mostly being the critical word.  But the characters are one-dimensional.  My viewing partner said her impression was that there was no character growth and she was right.  I found it entertaining in a chick-flick kind of way.  The only truly misguided part was the role of the headmistress or principal, who I guess was supposed to embody all of liberal societal prejudice.  No educator in NYC would dare voice the types of complaints she does or be so insensitive.  I can't even think why she would want to - what does a principal get from forcing assimilation on a teacher?",3,Mostly entertaining,1254614400,"10 4, 2009",2009,693,"['word', 'caution', 'balance', 'raves', ""'ve"", 'read', 'here', 'fine', 'little', 'movie', 'acting', 'mostly', 'good', 'Mostly', 'being', 'critical', 'word', 'characters', 'are', 'one-dimensional', 'viewing', 'partner', 'said', 'impression', 'was', 'was', 'character', 'growth', 'was', 'right', 'found', 'entertaining', 'chick-flick', 'kind', 'way', 'only', 'truly', 'misguided', 'part', 'was', 'role', 'headmistress', 'principal', 'who', 'guess', 'was', 'supposed', 'embody', 'liberal', 'societal', 'prejudice', 'educator', 'NYC', 'would', 'dare', 'voice', 'types', 'complaints', 'be', 'so', 'insensitive', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'what', 'principal', 'get', 'forcing', 'assimilation', 'teacher']",Arranged
1130485,AJVK8E6MEF6WU,B00116VG3M,Alex,"[2, 2]","Loved this little filme by director Diane Cresco about a friendship between two deeply religious female teachers - one Jewish and one Muslim, but both agreeing to arranged marriages.  Although everyone around them [the principal of the school, students, their families] views their relationship as somewhat unsettling or unnatural, the women prevail in their close connection.  It is a sweet film proving that shared experience is what truly matters, not labels and politics.  As the women go on their quest for a family-approved husband we see them go on some hilarious dates and meet several amusingly awful prospects and sometimes get frustrated and hopeless - turning to brief scenes of rebellion before ultimately choosing to stay true to their tradition.Zoe Lister-Jones and Francis Benhamou are perfectly cast, no action seems like a stretch, they fit into their respective characters with grace and ease.  Moreover, the women are strong lead characters - much unlike women's roles in romantic comedies where all they do is whatever their man wants (or whatever will get them a man).  Rochel and Nasira choose their own fates, despite having them arranged.  They make the decision to follow the tradition of arranged marriages and then they go on to decide who they will marry.  Arranged in a wonderful showcase of friendship and love without boundaries or prejudice.  I highly recommend it.",5,touching and humorous,1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,1398,"['Loved', 'little', 'filme', 'director', 'Diane', 'Cresco', 'friendship', 'two', 'deeply', 'religious', 'female', 'teachers', 'one', 'Jewish', 'one', 'Muslim', 'agreeing', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'everyone', '[', 'principal', 'school', 'students', 'families', ']', 'views', 'relationship', 'somewhat', 'unsettling', 'unnatural', 'women', 'prevail', 'close', 'connection', 'sweet', 'film', 'proving', 'shared', 'experience', 'what', 'truly', 'matters', 'not', 'labels', 'politics', 'women', 'go', 'quest', 'family-approved', 'husband', 'see', 'go', 'hilarious', 'dates', 'meet', 'several', 'amusingly', 'awful', 'prospects', 'sometimes', 'get', 'frustrated', 'hopeless', 'turning', 'brief', 'scenes', 'rebellion', 'ultimately', 'choosing', 'stay', 'true', 'tradition.Zoe', 'Lister-Jones', 'Francis', 'Benhamou', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'action', 'stretch', 'fit', 'respective', 'characters', 'grace', 'ease', 'Moreover', 'women', 'are', 'strong', 'lead', 'characters', 'much', 'women', 'roles', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'where', 'do', 'whatever', 'man', 'will', 'get', 'man', 'Rochel', 'Nasira', 'choose', 'own', 'fates', 'having', 'arranged', 'make', 'decision', 'follow', 'tradition', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'then', 'go', 'decide', 'who', 'will', 'marry', 'Arranged', 'wonderful', 'showcase', 'friendship', 'love', 'boundaries', 'prejudice', 'highly', 'recommend']",Arranged
1130486,A3C00N4UHA5XYX,B00116VG3M,alooknac,"[4, 5]","I enjoyed this film and did not get bored watching it. I agree with most of the comments reviewers have made, including some somewhat contradictory ones.The movie is well done but there are some awkward parts. It is definitely simplistic, does include stereotypes, and I did feel it presented the Jewish family in a less favorable light than the Muslim family. Anti-Semitism? Political agenda? Not in my opinion. Equality or acceptance does not mean everything has to be doled out in exactly equal portions. It's OK for a Jewish family to be shown to have more negatives than a Muslim family. That does not translate into ""all Jewish families are more controlling and less accepting than all Muslim families.""As far as the lead characters making a ""choice"", well it's a limited choice. Nasira is never shown to question her beliefs or practices. Yes she gets annoyed at being asked to seriously consider one very unsuitable mate but that's about it.When Rochel becomes distressed over her options, she goes to visit a cousin who lives a secular lifestyle and they go to a party where of course Rochel is extremely uncomfortable. Rochel's ""choice"" is made to seem very black and white--stay with what you know and accept a mate you may not want, or escape into the world, drink, do drugs, have wanton sex, and never see your family again. Those viewers unfamiliar with the culture may not understand that anyone who leaves their home and beliefs is declared dead, actually mourned the same as if they had died, and no one in their family will ever talk to them again. So ""choice"" is not exactly what you may be thinking. Most young people need a lot of help from family to get started in life and to do without that help and support can be an insurmountable obstacle.I think ""choosing"" to be religiously observant is way overplayed. For most children in deeply religious families, leaving is unimaginable and would be incredibly isolating, and the option of staying but not following observant ways just doesn't exist. Could Rochel had stayed in her family and religion and just ""chosen"" to not get married or to date and pick out her own spouse? I don't think so. Could Nasira likewise have just decided to go out into the world dressing in a secular fashion while still living at home? Don't think so.Well that's my soapbox. But that's why it's a good movie. It gets you thinking and talking about such ideas.The part about the Unity circle was just awful. It seemed the worst possible way to try to teach inclusion--give people simplistic labels and choose to exclude or accept them based on the labels. Whatever message the movie was trying to convey was unclear to me--the awkwardness and inexperience of new teachers perhaps?Another enjoyable movie that touches on these topics--solely from a Muslim point of view--is Sabah. It has its faults too, but includes some drama, some romance, and also humor. The scene where a girl is being pressured to meet a prospective mate is hilarious and how it plays out was very well done. Sabah shows more of a middle ground of staying in the family but the family evolving to accept some change.",4,Better than most movies out there,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,3138,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'bored', 'watching', 'agree', 'most', 'comments', 'reviewers', 'have', 'made', 'including', 'somewhat', 'contradictory', 'ones.The', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'are', 'awkward', 'parts', 'definitely', 'simplistic', 'include', 'stereotypes', 'did', 'feel', 'presented', 'Jewish', 'family', 'less', 'favorable', 'light', 'Muslim', 'family', 'Anti-Semitism', 'Political', 'agenda', 'Not', 'opinion', 'Equality', 'acceptance', 'not', 'mean', 'everything', 'be', 'doled', 'out', 'exactly', 'equal', 'portions', 'OK', 'Jewish', 'family', 'be', 'shown', 'have', 'more', 'negatives', 'Muslim', 'family', 'not', 'translate', 'Jewish', 'families', 'are', 'more', 'controlling', 'less', 'accepting', 'Muslim', 'families', 'As', 'far', 'lead', 'characters', 'making', 'choice', 'well', 'limited', 'choice', 'Nasira', 'never', 'shown', 'question', 'beliefs', 'practices', 'Yes', 'annoyed', 'being', 'asked', 'seriously', 'consider', 'one', 'very', 'unsuitable', 'mate', 'it.When', 'Rochel', 'distressed', 'options', 'visit', 'cousin', 'who', 'secular', 'lifestyle', 'go', 'party', 'where', 'course', 'Rochel', 'extremely', 'uncomfortable', 'Rochel', 'choice', 'made', 'seem', 'very', 'black', 'white', 'stay', 'what', 'know', 'accept', 'mate', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'escape', 'world', 'drink', 'do', 'drugs', 'have', 'wanton', 'sex', 'never', 'see', 'family', 'again', 'viewers', 'unfamiliar', 'culture', 'may', 'not', 'understand', 'anyone', 'who', 'home', 'beliefs', 'declared', 'dead', 'actually', 'mourned', 'same', 'had', 'died', 'one', 'family', 'will', 'ever', 'talk', 'again', 'choice', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'thinking', 'Most', 'young', 'people', 'need', 'lot', 'help', 'family', 'get', 'started', 'life', 'do', 'help', 'support', 'can', 'be', 'insurmountable', 'obstacle.I', 'think', 'choosing', 'be', 'religiously', 'observant', 'way', 'overplayed', 'most', 'children', 'deeply', 'religious', 'families', 'leaving', 'unimaginable', 'would', 'be', 'incredibly', 'isolating', 'option', 'staying', 'not', 'following', 'observant', 'ways', 'just', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Could', 'Rochel', 'had', 'stayed', 'family', 'religion', 'just', 'chosen', 'not', 'get', 'married', 'date', 'pick', 'out', 'own', 'spouse', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Could', 'Nasira', 'likewise', 'have', 'just', 'decided', 'go', 'out', 'world', 'dressing', 'secular', 'fashion', 'still', 'living', 'home', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.Well', 'soapbox', 'why', 'good', 'movie', 'thinking', 'talking', 'such', 'ideas.The', 'part', 'Unity', 'circle', 'was', 'just', 'awful', 'seemed', 'worst', 'possible', 'way', 'try', 'teach', 'inclusion', 'give', 'people', 'simplistic', 'labels', 'choose', 'exclude', 'accept', 'based', 'labels', 'message', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'convey', 'was', 'unclear', 'awkwardness', 'inexperience', 'new', 'teachers', 'perhaps', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'topics', 'solely', 'Muslim', 'point', 'view', 'Sabah', 'faults', 'too', 'drama', 'romance', 'also', 'humor', 'scene', 'where', 'girl', 'being', 'pressured', 'meet', 'prospective', 'mate', 'hilarious', 'how', 'out', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Sabah', 'more', 'middle', 'ground', 'staying', 'family', 'family', 'evolving', 'accept', 'change']",Arranged

Thankful ""RolyPolyBear""","[4, 5]","I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie and especially liked the ladies' backtalk to the ""all-knowing"" Streisand-ish principal of the school they work for.  That woman played her role very well---she really was obnoxious and annoying!  LOL!  Anyway, the reason for my review is to say that since everyone was basically dressed modestly in this movie (with a few minor character's being ""worldly"" that is) except for the one scene where Rochel leaves her parents' house and goes to see a ""renegade"" family member who no longer is with the Orthodox faith... Though it was nice Rochel had someone to talk to, the scene then has her going to a party with her relative and what ensues is your typical bumping and grinding to music and drinking and when Rochel tries to flee from a guy who is being a jerk, she opens one door to a group of people who are obviously doing drugs and offer her some.  Then she opens another door to bump into people vigorously making out.  The good thing about this is that if your DVD player has it so you can ""skip"" chapters or scenes, you can skip this scene as soon as Rochel leaves her parents' house, and the next scene is Rochel and Nisira talking at school.  It is very hard these days to find a movie of this caliber without something smutty in it, so just skip this scene and you will enjoy the movie more.

Both are from highly structured, orthodox religious traditions. Rochel Meshenberg (Zoe Lister-Jones) is Jewish while Nisira Khaldi (Francis Benhamou) is Muslim. When a student brings up the topic of religious hatred between these two spiritual traditions the question is posited, ""Is it possible for the two to become friends?""As you probably guessed, that's exactly what happens despite the rather obvious disapproval displayed by their families. When Rochel and Nisira learn that both sets of parents are actively seeking arranged marriages for their daughters they discover they have more in common than they ever thought they would. Relying on each other for strength and support through the trials and tribulations of submitting to the customs of their religious traditions they find a friendship that transcends cultural differences.Critique: `Arranged' held my complete interest from beginning to end. The relationship between Rochel and Nisira is beautifully and thoughtfully presented and totally believable.

1130497,A2ZJ2H6DRSPVZ8,B00116VG3M,Diane Stranz,"[0, 0]","Good films aid and assist moral growth and individuation, and this beautifully done movie definitely qualifies as ""good film.""  The fact that it is a small-budget independent film shot in less than 20 days puts into shameful perspective how much time, money and human potential is wasted on idiotic big budget action films which rake in money but ultimately have (at best) no positive personal impact.  Yes we watch movies to be entertained, but good film edifies at the same time that it entertains.That said, I didn't give the movie five stars because the ending strikes me as contrived.  First, it strikes me as highly improbable that the Jewish matchmaker would so readily accept matchmaking information for Rochel from a stranger (Rochel's Muslim friend pretending to be Jewish).  I guess it COULD happen, but -- again -- that plot turn greatly reduced the story's believability and began to make it seem more 'Hollywood fantasy"" than ""independent realism.""Second, I was frustrated by the ending:  have they totally given up on their desires to teach school?  Are two such competent and strong women really content just to sit at the park with matching baby buggies and chit chat?  And I really didn't like Rochel's comment that as mothers they are going to have their families wrapped around their little fingers (or something like that) to signify that they are now changing into women just like their mothers.  I have always hated the stereotypical assumption that people 'inevitably' grow up to be just like their parents when they are adults -- that is SO untrue!  I am nothing like either of my parents, and no one who is truly an individual is going to end up living out a cultural stereotype.  I feel like the filmmakers sold out two well-crafted and believable characters by a formulaic, agenda-laden ending (IMHO).Third, like Tom Hanks' character in the movie Big when he attends the Empire-State-Building-Turning-Into-A-Robot toy presentation, I have to admit that with respect to the Unity Circle activity:  ""I don't get it.""  Rochel uses the activity to teach 4th graders that people choose their own friends based upon individual characteristics -- and I guess that is her point -- but she also seems to teach that you can be accepted by almost anyone if you simply change (or repress) something vital about yourself (i.e., the child who self-identified as 'nasty' will likely be accepted back into the circle if he simply chooses a nicer characteristic with which to self-identify) . . . and, so, at the risk of looking stupid, ""I don't get it.""I don't see how the Unity Circle adds anything to the class' understanding of religious tension between Muslims and Jews, when Nijera had already given an excellent explanation in class:  that there are millions of Muslims around the world of different nationalities, languages and beliefs, and that hatred is born of ignorance between people who do not try to understand one another.  She makes it clear (by implication) that she and Rochel are not the type of people to fall into the stereotype of Muslim-Jew mutual hatred -- and, again, I don't see where the Unity Circle added to that AT ALL.  Yet the film gives the impression that the Unity Circle activity was inspired, enlightened and explained why Rochel and Nijera are friends despite religious differences.Those things said, there are many things I love about this movie.  For example, I agree with other reviewers who applaud this film for the very well done party scene:  Rochel has no interest whatsoever in engaging in immoral activities which violate her religious beliefs, and THIS I found to be realistic.  People with loose moral standards rationalize their behavior by telling themselves that ""everyone"" is tempted by immorality and that those who live a moral life only do so because they repress base (natural) desires through rigid self-discipline.  WRONG.I also love the positive portrayal of arranged marriage because even though I am glad I had the freedom to choose my own spouse(s), I think a good marriage results more from the moral and loving attitudes and actions exhibited within the marriage itself than from any factors existing at the time two people meet and agree to marry.  Thus, two people who have a lot in common and good chemistry can end up in a horrible marriage if one or both of them choose during the marriage to adopt attitudes/actions/desires inconsistent with a good marital relationship -- and two strangers who start out with almost nothing in common can, over time, build a strong, loving relationship if they are both committed to doing so.As a young girl I thought arranged marriage was right up there with foot-binding with respect to ""cruel human practices,"" but God challenged that idea by leading me to read Marjorie Holmes' beautiful novel 'Two from Galilee.'  Two from Galilee is the imagined love story of Mary and Joseph (parents of Jesus), but what struck me most was how Holmes imagined the love story between Mary's parents, who were strangers before being bound together by their parents via an arranged marriage.  I don't want to give any further spoilers, so please read this wonderful book for yourself -- especially if you profess Christianity.  It is a sign of the lost state of the organized church that Two from Galilee isn't even sold in Christian bookstores any more -- but I know you can buy it off Amazon.One last note:  I watched this film with preteen boys and it was a wonderful catalyst for indepth conversation about many important cultural, religious and interpersonal topics.

On the one hand, it does not romanticize sincere devotion as an always clear or comfortable path; and it vividly portrays both the humour and the frustration a younger generation may experience in receiving guidance from its elders. On the other hand, it does not condemn or even trivialize 'conservative' adherence to such beliefs and traditions.I especially appreciated one episode involving a party, in which a young woman's reaction, to things so many today would consider normal social activity, is depicted neither as self-righteousness nor as weakness nor even as temptation-barely-avoided. She simply does not find that world attractive.  Indeed, far more of us understand her aversion than most of the entertainment industry usually recognizes. And when, later, she does pointedly 'take a stand', it is against someone whose pride in being more 'worldly' and 'sophisticated' was what had proved the REAL self-righteousness.Ultimately, however, this is a story of affirmation, and a film both charming and fun.

But there is more to it than that. We are reminded of the contrast between the unchanging requiremnts of ancient religons and the maelstrom of change within the postmodern secular American Society and the needs of children which transcend faith boundaries.For me as someone not of either faith, the film is rather like lifting a curtain and getting a glimpse of something normally hidden from the eye. I find the structure of each of the families that we are shown are very similar. The antiquated family structure forged by pre-industrial and agrarian societies has adapted to the demands off the present and yet the role of the husband remains, relatively the same. There are a number of similarities in what we are presented with which suggest that the different religions are somewhat similar, although given the limited amount the viewer is shown, this demands further investigation.A question arises as to how much of this film is an attempt to show the relevance of the role of family in each faith in the face of more 21st century living.All in all in a nice kind of way it is a thoughtful sort of film although I would have preferred more of a cerebral challenging personally.",4,"I'm on the outside, looking inside",1203033600,"02 15, 2008",2008,1678,"['Set', 'backdrop', 'Brooklyn', 'school', 'nice', 'movie', 'ostensibly', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'two', 'young', 'teachers', 'one', 'Muslim', 'one', 'Jewish.The', 'central', 'issue', 'superficially', 'question', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'historical', 'cultural', 'tradition', 'faiths', 'how', 'bond', 'friendship', 'two', 'girls', 'grow', 'processes', 'develop.Of', 'course', 'timing', 'such', 'movie', 'critical', 'given', 'very', 'polarised', 'situation', 'currently', 'Middle', 'East', 'more', 'are', 'reminded', 'contrast', 'unchanging', 'requiremnts', 'ancient', 'religons', 'maelstrom', 'change', 'postmodern', 'secular', 'American', 'Society', 'needs', 'children', 'transcend', 'faith', 'boundaries.For', 'someone', 'not', 'faith', 'film', 'rather', 'like', 'lifting', 'curtain', 'getting', 'glimpse', 'something', 'normally', 'hidden', 'eye', 'find', 'structure', 'families', 'are', 'shown', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'antiquated', 'family', 'structure', 'forged', 'pre-industrial', 'agrarian', 'societies', 'adapted', 'demands', 'present', 'yet', 'role', 'husband', 'relatively', 'same', 'are', 'number', 'similarities', 'what', 'are', 'presented', 'suggest', 'different', 'religions', 'are', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'given', 'limited', 'amount', 'viewer', 'shown', 'further', 'investigation.A', 'question', 'arises', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'attempt', 'show', 'relevance', 'role', 'family', 'faith', 'face', 'more', '21st', 'century', 'living.All', 'nice', 'kind', 'way', 'thoughtful', 'sort', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'cerebral', 'challenging', 'personally']",Arranged

Schaefer & Diane Crespo keep the action focused and the story paced briskly.  Rochel is played by Zoe Lister-Jones who does an excellent job as a Jewish girl teaching in the public schools.  She helps a visually impaired student.  The uncertainty Lister-Jones shows as she sorts through a number of suitors including Daniel London's hilariously played nervous guy cameo as Elliot is entrancing to watch.  Finally, Rochel spots Gideon played mysteriously by Jason Liebman who catches her eye & then becomes the apple of her eye.Nasira is played by Francis Benhamou who does an excellent job as the Islamic teacher at the same school where Rochel teaches.  As first teaching days sometimes go, one of the students demands to know if Nasira wants to kill Rochel because of their different faiths.  Benhamou does an excellent job showing a bit more assertive personality than Rochel and takes matters into her own hands to unite Rochel & Gabriel.  Nasira eventually is moved by Jamil played by Sanjit DeSilva as the two are united through the traditional channels.Both the fathers are portrayed as loving and tender who truly care for their daughters.  This is one of the best aspects of the film.  John Rothman plays Matan who claims his blood pressure is going sky high because Rochel is not picking any of the husband candidates.  Laith Nakli plays Nasira's father Abdul-Halim likewise with a tenderness that makes us feel how strong the family bonds are.  Marcia Jean Kurtz also turns in a strong performance as Principal Jacoby who wants to get too involved in the lives of her teachers, but fails to respect the traditional cultures.

It had many good messages: in tradition there is culture; in family there is belonging; in faithfulness there is confidence. Yet it completely avoided preaching as seen in some religious movies (Fireproof) and grandstanding as seen in mainstream movies (where the religious person is the bad guy). It simply tells a story.

The similarities between the two are surrounded on the fact that they are old fashioned, and hold on to an era gratefully forgotten. Both women of dating age must date, and marry the man that is chosen for them. Whether it is by Matchmaker, or Daddy dearest. They are both teachers, they both dress to religious specifications. They both get involved in the matchmaking process to assure their friend is not marrying a dog. &#34;Woof&#34; They both can not stand the person that is arranged for them to marry.In spite of a long drawn out, bore fest. It fails in the script, however the acting is the only positive thing I can say about this yawn. If your into female movies with little to NO substance this is for you.Taking place in New York young Jewish Rokala &#34;Rachel&#34; comes of age to marry. No sooner then her finishing school does her parents start throwing her in the dating pool. Calling all creeps, calling all creeps fresh meat here! The matchmaker, and her parents waste little time with a bunch of eligible bachelors. Geriatrics, Rude, pushy schmucks who don't ever stop flushing their toilet of a mouth. Men who's only hope for marriage outside of mail order brides, is the old fashioned custom of parents giving away their children for marriage to the guy with the most money, and success. Tell young Rachel that you don't have to look at him to procreate.Her friend a lovely young woman whose name I did not care enough to remember. She is having similar problems with her family, minus a pushy matchmaker. Her dad sets her up with a plethora of men old enough to be her uncle, that want to pounce on top of her. She befriends Rachel, and both teach at the same school.&#34;Skip to scene&#34; where there Boss / principal get involved telling them to put on makeup, and offering a donation towards a new wardrobe for both of them. Instead of standing up for their rights, they bite their lip, smile, and decline the generous offer. The Principal gets involved a couple more times, and then finally Rachel tells her off.They bring each other home to each respected families. &#34;Hi Mom, look what's coming to dinner.&#34; The families act as you can expect, all uptight, and quiet. You can always tell a bigot, watch the body language, how they eye you for being different. Funny every ethnic race plays the race card. Kudos to the talentless list of C Grade actors making this a gem for the ages.The fun starts when they both see an attractive guy for the other, who happens to be the right religion, and begin playing matchmaker.  Stereotype much director.

1130528,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00116VG3M,Z Hayes,"[33, 35]","""Arranged"" is a delightful tale of a friendship that develops between a traditional Muslim, Nasira [Francis Benhamou] and an Orthodox Jew,Rochel [Zoe Lister Jones] who both teach at a Brooklyn school. A class session raises the question from one of the students :How can a Jew be friends with a Muslim? and this sets the stage for the two women to come together and eventually form a close friendship.Both Nasira and Rochel are from very traditional backgrounds and though their faiths set them apart from each other, it is also the strictures required by those faiths that bring them together and help them commisserate with each other - they are both in the process of being matchmade by their respective families to 'suitable' young men from their own religious backgrounds. Nasira balks at one of the suitors her father brings forth and Rochel finds herself being put in awkward 'blind dates' by her well-meaning but clueless aunt.Yes, there are some sappy bits in this movie, but the portrayal of tradition is very credibly done, and the strong acting by the two female leads elevates this movie from just another social commentary. Having come from a very traditional family myself, I can relate to the emotional conflicts these girls go through, and though I rejected the pressures placed upon me, I can also understand and respect why these two young women chose to keep to their traditions and appease their parents. It doesn't mean that they are weak, its ultimately their choice.This is a subtle and well-directed movie that often elicited smiles and tears as I sat through it.
