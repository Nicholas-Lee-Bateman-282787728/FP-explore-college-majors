Beverly""","[0, 0]","Like the movie, Donnie Darko, that I just watched, here is another tragic and dark teen flick, that's well written and interesting, but perhaps a bit depressing.  I will say it was much better than Mean Creek, and while still sad, I think I found a little bit more that was positive or redemptive in this flick.If you enjoyed either of the two other movies I just mentioned, you'd probably like this one.  While Spacey is in this flick, his role is limited and this is no American Beauty type story or movie, even though both films share a dark and tragic type formula.In any case, my teenage daughter really likes this, she owns it, and I found it entertaining to watch and would recommend it to watch at least once.  It's a good film for opening dialogue, at the very least, however I can't see myself wanting to watch it again, either, so perhaps one could make a strong case for simply renting the thing.As a side note, the acting by Don Cheadle was superb and the talent of Jena Malone, who was also in the above mentioned Donnie Darko, is very good, she has a strong on screen presence.",3,"Dark but entertaining, a makes-you-think movie",1108684800,"02 18, 2005",2005,1092,"['movie', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'just', 'watched', 'here', 'tragic', 'dark', 'teen', 'flick', 'well', 'written', 'interesting', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'depressing', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Mean', 'Creek', 'still', 'sad', 'think', 'found', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'was', 'positive', 'redemptive', 'flick.If', 'enjoyed', 'two', 'other', 'movies', 'just', 'mentioned', ""'d"", 'probably', 'one', 'Spacey', 'flick', 'role', 'limited', 'American', 'Beauty', 'type', 'story', 'movie', 'even', 'films', 'share', 'dark', 'tragic', 'type', 'formula.In', 'case', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'really', 'found', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'would', 'recommend', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'good', 'film', 'opening', 'dialogue', 'very', 'least', 'however', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'wanting', 'watch', 'again', 'either', 'perhaps', 'one', 'could', 'make', 'strong', 'case', 'simply', 'renting', 'thing.As', 'side', 'note', 'acting', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'was', 'superb', 'talent', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'above', 'mentioned', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'very', 'good', 'strong', 'screen', 'presence']",N/A

Everyone working on it clearly thought they were doing really important work, but didn't take the time to step back and realise they were all doing very ordinary work.  It's ordinary writing, very ordinary direction and there is so much acting with a capital A going on, which makes the acting ultimately very ordinary as well. It's like a series of earnest audition scenes strung into a rambling telemovie, with some music video cutting interspersing it all to give the illusion of style.  Lack of narrative focus is also a huge problem.  Just who is this film about?  It should be called ""The Fractured States of Leland"".  Strangely, two other films disappointed me recently in exactly the same way as this one.  All three films had great trailers cut from them that made me want to watch them and all three failed to deliver in a major way.  And all come from Paramount Classics.

The ""why"" question is pondered to a fatalistic ending in THE UNITED STATES OF LELAND, starring Ryan Gosling (HALF NELSON) as the emotionally detached Leland P. Fitzgerald.Leland is introduced to us during a terrible scene in which a young retarded boy lay stabbed to death on a grassy playground. It appears that Leland has had some sort of mental breakdown, as he stabbed the boy and then himself, ""just to see what it felt like."" But as the movie progresses we see plenty of emotional distance from the other characters, too. Leland's own father Albert (Kevin Spacey, SUPERMAN RETURNS) hasn't had much contact with Leland since he was eight years old. Leland's previous girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone, DONNIE DARKO) zones out by shooting heroin and isolating herself away from her family. Even Leland's mother Marybeth (Lena Olin, CASANOVA) simply slips in and checks on Leland occasionally, only asking if he's ""okay"" even when it's evident he's not.The only one interested in Leland turns out to be a teacher at the prison where he's held after the murder. But even the teacher, Mr. Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle, HOTEL RWANDA), is only occupied with Leland as a way to break out of his writing slump (he's a would-be author with serious blockage problems).Leland questions the ""why"" of everything around him, and it's an interesting message that gets pulled from the film. Why is it you're considered ""only human"" when you do something wrong and not something right? Like pulling a little kid from a burning building. Why don't we show emotions in equal measure when someone dies? These are tough questions that trickle out of the film.The downside is that the movie doesn't give us a good reason for Cheadle's character to be enraptured with Leland so early and so quickly (considering that's a large portion of the film, it's pretty significant). And most viewers won't like the incredibly slow pace, as well as the occasionally stilted line delivery. But that's it.The cast is excellent, from Spacey's spacey father to the embittered and lost Malone, the characters were fairly riveting to watch, even though all that happens is some intense dialogue throughout.In the end, it'll all depend on your expectations and mindset. If you're expecting something that moves along at a good clip, forget it. If you're in the mood for action, blood, and fights, don't even think about it. But if you're ready for some deep contemplation, The United States of Leland is right up your alley.",3,"The ""Whys"" Of The World",1160697600,"10 13, 2006",2006,2549,"['Why', 'do', 'people', 'do', 'good', 'bad', 'things', 'What', 'purpose', 'do', 'serve', 'why', 'question', 'pondered', 'fatalistic', 'ending', 'THE', 'UNITED', 'STATES', 'OF', 'LELAND', 'starring', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'HALF', 'NELSON', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'Leland', 'P.', 'Fitzgerald.Leland', 'introduced', 'terrible', 'scene', 'young', 'retarded', 'boy', 'lay', 'stabbed', 'death', 'grassy', 'playground', 'Leland', 'had', 'sort', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'stabbed', 'boy', 'then', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'felt', 'movie', 'see', 'plenty', 'emotional', 'distance', 'other', 'characters', 'too', 'Leland', 'own', 'father', 'Albert', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'SUPERMAN', 'RETURNS', ""n't"", 'had', 'much', 'contact', 'Leland', 'was', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'Leland', 'previous', 'girlfriend', 'Becky', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'DONNIE', 'DARKO', 'out', 'shooting', 'heroin', 'isolating', 'away', 'family', 'Even', 'Leland', 'mother', 'Marybeth', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'CASANOVA', 'simply', 'checks', 'Leland', 'occasionally', 'only', 'asking', 'okay', 'even', 'when', 'evident', 'only', 'one', 'interested', 'Leland', 'out', 'be', 'teacher', 'prison', 'where', 'held', 'murder', 'even', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Pearl', 'Madison', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'HOTEL', 'RWANDA', 'only', 'occupied', 'Leland', 'way', 'break', 'writing', 'slump', 'would-be', 'author', 'serious', 'blockage', 'problems', '.Leland', 'questions', 'why', 'everything', 'interesting', 'message', 'pulled', 'film', 'Why', ""'re"", 'considered', 'only', 'human', 'when', 'do', 'something', 'wrong', 'not', 'something', 'right', 'pulling', 'little', 'kid', 'burning', 'building', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'emotions', 'equal', 'measure', 'when', 'someone', 'are', 'tough', 'questions', 'trickle', 'film.The', 'downside', 'movie', ""n't"", 'give', 'good', 'reason', 'Cheadle', 'character', 'be', 'enraptured', 'Leland', 'so', 'early', 'so', 'quickly', 'considering', 'large', 'portion', 'film', 'pretty', 'significant', 'most', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'incredibly', 'slow', 'pace', 'as', 'well', 'occasionally', 'stilted', 'line', 'delivery', 'it.The', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Spacey', 'spacey', 'father', 'embittered', 'lost', 'Malone', 'characters', 'were', 'fairly', 'riveting', 'watch', 'even', 'intense', 'dialogue', 'end', ""'ll"", 'depend', 'expectations', 'mindset', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'something', 'along', 'good', 'clip', 'forget', ""'re"", 'mood', 'action', 'blood', 'fights', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', ""'re"", 'ready', 'deep', 'contemplation', 'United', 'States', 'Leland', 'right', 'alley']",N/A

I have found this to be not only a really touching and interesting film but a very engaging performance from Gosling.  While conversing with the juvenile corrections teacher (Don Cheadle), Gosling, playing a confessed juvenile murderer, reached right into my heart and made me feel his hopeless confusion with life and its many rules.  By the end, I not only knew why he committed the seemingly senseless murder of a mentally challenged younger boy, but I was asking myself if I would have felt the same way about the homicidal outcome. It was an amazing piece of explanatory acting from such a young man to make me understand such an incomprehensible act of violence.  The supporting actors were good but Martin Donovan, as the father of the murdered boy was elegant in his portrayal of a patriarch trying to guard and shield his family during the aftermath of the utterly inexplicable violence done to his family.

But the movie is very interested in the idea that sometimes, people just do bad things. That it is ""only human"" to experience pain, fear, anger, etc., and to lash out with them, even though doing it won't make anything any better (and will probably make them worse). That we choose to do these horrible things and... really... there is no ""why.""If this review seems more philosophy than a description of plot, etc., it's because it's that kind of movie.

It could also be thought of as the sequel to ""American Beauty"".The United States of Leland is about the the state of the youth in the United States. Leland is a young man of about 16 who, for all intents and purposes, is an intelligent young man with a promising future. Unfortunately, when we meet him, he has just murdered the brother of the girl he's in love with.Ryan Gosling (Leland) is a really intense actor. He manages to portray Leland as a troubled young man troubled by nothing, because he doesn't know enough to be troubled by it. Lelan's expressions are overtly intense and often seem too affected, but that's the point. Leland has to really think about his actions to determine whether they are socially acceptable - he has no point of reference. He is the product of a modern American family: working mother divorced from absent father, neither of whom parented Leland - they mearly gave him life and then expected him to figure things out for himself.Leland's father (Kevin Spacey) is a self absorbed, and self important author. He has learned over the years to believe his own press and wallow in it - he has never had any involvement with his ex-wife or children. He lives in Paris and sends Leland tickets to come visit him. When Leland flys to New York for the first leg of the first visit as a young child, he decides he'd rather visit New York than visit his uncaring, unloving father, so he stays there. His father doesn't miss him. It becomes something of a game: Dad continues sending plane tickets every six months and Leland keeps travelling to any place BUT to visit his father.  In over ten years of tickets supplied, Leland has not once seen his father. The father never once divulges this information to Leland's mother - and Leland never bothers to tell her either. He begins to have a sexual relationship with the matriarch (30 years older than him) of a family who took him in when they discovered him living in a movie theatre in New York.Leland takes up with a girl who is a heroin addict not much more functional than Leland. Her little brother is retarded. Her high school senior sister is living the life that most other teen girls would love to live - her boyfriend lives with her in her parents house, though having sexual relations with her - all with her parents' approval.There's not a single ""functional"" person in this film - and yet - you'll recognize most of them, because for most outward appearances, you know these people. You may be one of these people.You are haunted by the sense that if just one adult in this film had treated their children as children and parented them instead of befriending them, that maybe the kids wouldn't be so screwed up.The film is less about the murder than it is about the events that brought the murder to be.

THE UNITED STATES OF LELAND is not an easy movie to watch:  the cinematic technique of nonlinear story telling superimposed on seemingly disparate fragments of stories requires careful concentration on the part of the viewer.  This is not a single story about a teenager's seemingly senseless murder of a mentally challenged child: this is a series of moments in the lives of two families disrupted by the chaos of 21st Century American lifestyle and the resulting dysfunctional attempts at postmortem struggling for meaning, for commitment, for the ability to love  Ryan Gosling gives yet another fine performance as a confused kid who can't remember his act of murder that sends him in to a juvenile detention center.  In a series of flashbacks we meet his borderline personality parents (Kevin Spacey as a selfish mental brute and Lena Olin  as a well-meaning socially overburdened beauty), his girlfriend (Jena Malone) whose family includes the mentally challenged brother who is the murder victim and her sister (Michelle Williams) who is faced with life decisions that growingly exclude her boyfriend (Chris Klein) and her fragmented parents Martin Donavan and Ann Magnuson, the older seductress Sherilyn Fenn, and perhaps most importantly - his teacher, Don Cheadle, a man who has a history of moral indiscretions all his own. What director Hoge does with this kettle of misfits is work through acts of seemingly meaningless tragedies in a way that ties all these disparate characters together in an uncomfortable fashion.  The ending approaches apocalyptic statements but they come as enough of a surprise to be justified.  This is definitely a thinking person's movie, but the investment of mental gymnastics is worth the ride. The acting is uniformly strong and allows many of the actors to realize strange roles that heighten our appreciation of their skills.

834545,AI8X8Y6KU7XXK,B0002I8372,Jason Horsley,"[5, 6]","The United States of Leland presents an impressively rich and complex array of human problems--neurosis, fear, grief, confusion, rage and sorrow--yet it never gets bogged down by them, it never feels indulgent or morose (as in the case of Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia, for example), and it never seems forced or contrived. Its only motive (like Leland's?) seems to be to release some of the unbearable pressure of empathy, in the face of an overwhelming universal sadness. And because it's a gesture made in earnest--without airs or expectations or ulterior motives--the film connects; it connects to something close to the essence of being human--our shared loneliness, and the isolate despair of being an island, a nation unto ourselves. As Leland says, all the tears in the world can't make what has happened unhappen. But the tears come anyway.In essence, Hoge's vision touches upon something profound: how the most apparently monstrous evil can come out of an excess of goodness, how the burden of empathy--of deeper seeing--can lead to the most desperate of acts, to suicide, for example, or murder. Like a distress signal from a lost soul afloat in a sea of lost souls, it suggests both complicity in despair and the possibility of release from it; like an aria, it appeals to audiences to let down the shields and the blinds, for just a moment, and look. Audiences could have cared less, however. Hoge's film appeared out of nowhere, and vanished back from whence it came soon after, under a barrage of critical incomprehension and outrage, and several attempts to boycott the film (by parents of autistic children, claiming it glorified murder--having never seen it, of course). I can think of no other recent film that was so unjustly overlooked as this, nor greater evidence of the nigh-pathological obtuseness of American film critics. (These are the same critics, mind, who hail a smug and asinine work like American Beauty as a work of moral depth, social relevance, and psychological poignancy!)Audience and critics' indifference notwithstanding, however, make no mistake about it: The United States of Leland attains the highest goal of art; by expressing the bottomless pain of a single individual, it eases the sadness of the world. That Hoge isn't recognized and acclaimed as a brilliant new film artist--along with Paul Thomas Anderson, Alexander Payne, and the rest of the new indie lights--is perhaps evidence of just how unwilling people are to be reminded of that sadness. Hoge made a masterpiece from the heart, and was duly punished.

Swagman,"[0, 0]","I'm not sure if this was a great movie or not, but I'll say this for it: it certainly held my interest while I was watching it.There are a lot of wheels spinning in this story at once. There's Leland, the mild mannered 16 year old boy who is in jail for killing a mentally impaired child, there is his teacher, an aspiring writer who thinks that writing a book about Leland might be his big break, there is his father, a famous novelist who hasn't seen his son in years, there is his former girlfriend, a relapsed drug addict, and her sister, and her sister's boyfriend, who now lives with their family after his own mother died, and as all of these wheels are turning, the question of why such a nice kid like Leland would commit such a horrible crime is slowly answered.Throw in a cool post-Tarantino esque out of order story line, and then add Don Cheadle (the teacher) and Kevin Spacey (the father), two of the best under-rated actors, and I'd say you've got yourself a film. Whether it means anything when all is said and done is, however, another question.I should probably give this film another watch and think about it a bit more, but off-hand I'd say the philosophy in this film struck me as shallow and fortune cookie-esque. And I'm not sure all of the events in this film entirely made sense.Of course I guess the filmmakers would argue that the whole point of the film is that human nature doesn't really make sense.

834548,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002I8372,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","""The United States of Leland"" walks a tightrope and it is not at all surprising that there are viewers who think it falls off and disappears into an abyss because there will be people who watch writer-director Matthew Ryan Hoge 2003's Indy film and complain that there is no there there.  The Leland of the title is Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling), who is incarcerated while awaiting trial for having stabbed to death a mentally retarded boy.  At least that is the headline everybody uses to describe the crime, but it turns out that the victim, Ryan Pollard (Michael Welch), was the autistic brother of Becky (Jena Malone), the girl that recently broke up with Leland.  This becomes the first clue in trying to make sense of this seemingly senseless murder, but if you are looking for a clear explication of Leland's motive by the end of this film you are probably going to be disappointed.That is not to say that you will not find such an explanation in ""The United States of Leland,"" but rather that you will be better off trying to piece it together instead of waiting for somebody to explain it to you.  That is because everybody in Leland's life is a piece of the puzzle.  His father (Kevin Spacey) is a famous writer who knows nothing about this son because his key involvement with Leland is to send him to European cities to experience them alone.  Jena has a drug addiction problem and a sister, Julie (Michelle Williams) who is dating Allen Harris (Chris Klein), who does not like what is happening to the Pollard family.  But Leland made a point of walking Ryan home when Becky was otherwise busy, which only adds another piece to the puzzle.Kept away from family and friends in an Arizona juvenile detention center, Leland piques the interest of Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle), a teacher and would-be writer who sees the mystery of the boy's motivations for the murder as having the makings of a great novel (fictional, he assures Leland's father when they meet in a bar, who is not comforted by that detail).  Pearl is warned off dealing with the accused outside of the classroom, but the teacher's dreams of success drive him to engage Leland in conversation and to encourage the boy to write in a journal.  The character of Pearl is necessary because our best clues will come from Leland and without his teacher's intervention he might not have anything to say.  But while we privilege what the murderer has to say, what the others in his life say and do become part of the equation as well.Perhaps ""The United States of Leland"" is another example of a cinematic Rorschach test where you read it the way you want.  At the start Leland tells his mother (Lena Olin) that he thinks he has made a mistake, and certainly that line can put everything that follows into doubt.  Or maybe Hoge has simply provided a movie buffet, where you can take what you want and come to your own conclusion as why Leland killed Ryan.  For those who like every thing crossed and dotted by the end credits ""The United States of Leland"" will be infuriating.  But for those who can enjoy coming to a movie on their own terms and reach a different conclusion each time they view it, this could be an interesting viewing experience.  For the former the above rating will be too high and for the latter it may well be too low, but that is because the middle ground on this one is a very small piece of terra firma indeed.",4,Maybe they call it a senseless murder for  reason,1133568000,"12 3, 2005",2005,3410,"['United', 'States', 'Leland', 'tightrope', 'not', 'surprising', 'are', 'viewers', 'who', 'think', 'abyss', 'will', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'writer-director', 'Matthew', 'Ryan', 'Hoge', '2003', 'Indy', 'film', 'complain', 'there', 'there', 'Leland', 'title', 'Leland', 'P.', 'Fitzgerald', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'who', 'incarcerated', 'awaiting', 'trial', 'having', 'stabbed', 'death', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'boy', 'least', 'headline', 'everybody', 'describe', 'crime', 'out', 'victim', 'Ryan', 'Pollard', 'Michael', 'Welch', 'was', 'autistic', 'brother', 'Becky', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'girl', 'recently', 'broke', 'up', 'Leland', 'first', 'clue', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'seemingly', 'senseless', 'murder', 'are', 'looking', 'clear', 'explication', 'Leland', 'motive', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed.That', 'not', 'say', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'such', 'explanation', 'United', 'States', 'Leland', 'rather', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'trying', 'piece', 'together', 'instead', 'waiting', 'somebody', 'explain', 'everybody', 'Leland', 'life', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'father', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'famous', 'writer', 'who', 'nothing', 'son', 'key', 'involvement', 'Leland', 'send', 'European', 'cities', 'experience', 'alone', 'Jena', 'drug', 'addiction', 'problem', 'sister', 'Julie', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'who', 'dating', 'Allen', 'Harris', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'who', 'not', 'like', 'what', 'happening', 'Pollard', 'family', 'Leland', 'made', 'point', 'walking', 'Ryan', 'home', 'when', 'Becky', 'was', 'otherwise', 'busy', 'only', 'piece', 'puzzle.Kept', 'away', 'family', 'friends', 'Arizona', 'juvenile', 'detention', 'center', 'Leland', 'interest', 'Pearl', 'Madison', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'teacher', 'would-be', 'writer', 'who', 'mystery', 'boy', 'motivations', 'murder', 'having', 'makings', 'great', 'novel', 'fictional', 'Leland', 'father', 'when', 'meet', 'bar', 'who', 'not', 'comforted', 'detail', 'Pearl', 'warned', 'off', 'dealing', 'accused', 'outside', 'classroom', 'teacher', 'dreams', 'success', 'drive', 'engage', 'Leland', 'conversation', 'encourage', 'boy', 'write', 'journal', 'character', 'Pearl', 'necessary', 'best', 'clues', 'will', 'come', 'Leland', 'teacher', 'intervention', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'anything', 'say', 'privilege', 'what', 'murderer', 'say', 'what', 'others', 'life', 'say', 'do', 'become', 'part', 'equation', 'well.Perhaps', 'United', 'States', 'Leland', 'example', 'cinematic', 'Rorschach', 'test', 'where', 'read', 'way', 'want', 'start', 'Leland', 'mother', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'made', 'mistake', 'certainly', 'line', 'can', 'put', 'everything', 'doubt', 'maybe', 'Hoge', 'simply', 'provided', 'movie', 'buffet', 'where', 'can', 'take', 'what', 'want', 'come', 'own', 'conclusion', 'why', 'Leland', 'killed', 'Ryan', 'who', 'like', 'thing', 'crossed', 'dotted', 'end', 'United', 'States', 'Leland', 'will', 'be', 'infuriating', 'who', 'can', 'enjoy', 'coming', 'movie', 'own', 'terms', 'reach', 'different', 'conclusion', 'time', 'view', 'could', 'be', 'interesting', 'viewing', 'experience', 'former', 'above', 'rating', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'high', 'latter', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'too', 'low', 'middle', 'ground', 'one', 'very', 'small', 'piece', 'terra', 'firma', 'indeed']",N/A

That's the theme of this film written and directed by a new, untested writer/director Mathew Hoge.  Ryan Gosling stars as Leland, a troubled teenager who has murdered a retarded boy.  It's a horrific crime and it impacts his small community.  Nobody understands why he did it and he doesn't deny the charges.  While awaiting trial he's sent to Juvenile Hall.  There, in a classroom, he starts a notebook entitled ""The United States of Leland' in which he writes about his life.  His teacher, Don Cheadle, is an aspiring writer.  He befriends the troubled youth but, as we get to know his character, we soon see that he is struggling with his own values.  There's a lot of serious conversation between the two with many close-ups on Gosling who seems wise beyond his years.The setting is the Juvenile Hall but that is downplayed in the film.  There's only a small amount of focus on any other person other than Gosling.  In flashbacks we learn about his attraction to the sister of the retarded youth he murdered, played by Jena Malone.  And there's a whole story within a story about her drug addiction and other sister and a young man without parents who lives with the family and is romancing the sister.  Kevin Spacey is cast as Ryan Gosling's divorced father, a successful writer who hasn't seen his son since the boy was six years old.  And there's one particular confrontation between the teacher and the father which is a high point of the film.Mostly, this is an intentionally ambiguous story as each of the characters struggle with issues of morality. However, even though the acting was excellent, the characters never seemed real to me.  There's lots of dialog and little action and nothing is ever really resolved.  The conclusion is rather contrived by yet appropriate and, at the end, I was left with some open questions to think about.",4,Ambiguous story about struggle between right and wrong,1083974400,"05 8, 2004",2004,1915,"['What', 'right', 'What', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'easy', 'draw', 'line', 'theme', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'new', 'untested', 'writer/director', 'Mathew', 'Hoge', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'stars', 'Leland', 'troubled', 'teenager', 'who', 'murdered', 'retarded', 'boy', 'horrific', 'crime', 'small', 'community', 'Nobody', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'deny', 'charges', 'awaiting', 'trial', 'sent', 'Juvenile', 'Hall', 'classroom', 'notebook', 'entitled', 'United', 'States', 'Leland', 'life', 'teacher', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'troubled', 'youth', 'get', 'know', 'character', 'soon', 'see', 'struggling', 'own', 'values', 'lot', 'serious', 'conversation', 'two', 'many', 'close-ups', 'Gosling', 'who', 'wise', 'years.The', 'setting', 'Juvenile', 'Hall', 'downplayed', 'film', 'only', 'small', 'amount', 'focus', 'other', 'person', 'other', 'Gosling', 'flashbacks', 'learn', 'attraction', 'sister', 'retarded', 'youth', 'murdered', 'played', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'whole', 'story', 'story', 'drug', 'addiction', 'other', 'sister', 'young', 'man', 'parents', 'who', 'family', 'romancing', 'sister', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'cast', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'divorced', 'father', 'successful', 'writer', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'son', 'boy', 'was', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'one', 'particular', 'confrontation', 'teacher', 'father', 'high', 'point', 'film.Mostly', 'intentionally', 'ambiguous', 'story', 'characters', 'struggle', 'issues', 'morality', 'However', 'even', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'characters', 'never', 'seemed', 'real', 'lots', 'dialog', 'little', 'action', 'nothing', 'ever', 'really', 'resolved', 'conclusion', 'rather', 'contrived', 'yet', 'appropriate', 'end', 'was', 'left', 'open', 'questions', 'think']",N/A

I don't know how I missed this one in the theatres, but after seeing it, I so know why.This movie is good, as movies as a whole go.  I have a friend who compares everything to ""Breeders"" since he feels that is the worst movie in his DVD collection.  This is better than ""Breeders"" but disappointing as the sundae that sat on the fountain counter too long and the hot fudge has melted all the ice cream.Kevin Spacey is excellent, and in the film for 10 - 15 minutes over time.  But, I don't understand his character, I only know what the other characters have said about him.The movie never really gets going.  It takes most of the movie for you to finally see how all the players are related.  It comes across not as some gift or plan of the story-telling, rather it seems for the sake of the way it is told, the author has to backtrack so we know why we should have been more moved by the story in the beginning.Ryan Gosling (Leland P. Fitzgerald) is making his best attempt to be apathetic, but he comes across 1/2 bored and 1/2 stupid.  I don't know if we are supposed to feel . . . something, anything . . . for Leland, but he feels so little himself - and not in the sociopathic way - that I think I am supposed to find Don Cheadle's (Pearl) character as the ""hero"" of the film, but ultimately he is just an opportunist, befriending Leland for his own purposes, not out of caring for Leland or any of his students.Maybe Chris Klein (Allen)  is the ""hero.""  The ultimate victim of circumstance in this film, and maybe the real tragedy in the film, second only to Ryan, the murder victim because, after all, he is dead.But, this movie IMO has the ultimate flaw any movie can succumb to . . . I don't care about any of the players.  Whatever the moral is Matthew Ryan Hoge (writer and director) is trying to get across, about people being flawed, and it being too damn hard to be a good person all the time, is lost.  Just saying it at the end of the movie doesn't make me believe it.  I haven't felt the loss of Ryan's parents, I haven't felt the anguish of the Ryan's sisters (at least, I think they are his sisters, or step sisters, who can tell?), I don't feel Leland's confusion, or Allen's disappointment, or anything at all for any of the characters.Lena Olin disappears as Leland's mother.  I think she was supposed to be an important character in the beginning, but she literally disappears from the film.  And sadly she is the only person that emotes in the film.I disagree with the reviewer who says this is a must see for fans of independent films.  The lure of independent films has been stories about people, for example regular people living regular lives finding themselves bored and sleepless in Tokyo.  We enjoy watching the characters and finding interest in all people being different.  These people just exist on the film. I do not learn anything about any of the characters unless they tell me something.  (...)The performances are fine; maybe they received little director about what they were supposed to convey, or how they were supposed to feel; or maybe Mr. Hoge thought it would all come together by itself in the end.  Stringing together events doesn't make a good story, no matter if you try to lead them to a ""surprising"" or ""shocking"" ending.",2,"Ambiguous at its best, Boring at its worst",1095033600,"09 13, 2004",2004,3322,"['always', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'missed', 'one', 'theatres', 'seeing', 'so', 'know', 'why.This', 'movie', 'good', 'as', 'movies', 'whole', 'go', 'have', 'friend', 'who', 'everything', 'Breeders', 'worst', 'movie', 'DVD', 'collection', 'better', 'Breeders', 'disappointing', 'sundae', 'sat', 'fountain', 'counter', 'too', 'long', 'hot', 'fudge', 'melted', 'ice', 'cream.Kevin', 'Spacey', 'excellent', 'film', '10', '15', 'minutes', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'character', 'only', 'know', 'what', 'other', 'characters', 'have', 'said', 'him.The', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'going', 'most', 'movie', 'finally', 'see', 'how', 'players', 'are', 'related', 'across', 'not', 'gift', 'plan', 'story-telling', 'rather', 'sake', 'way', 'told', 'author', 'backtrack', 'know', 'why', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'moved', 'story', 'beginning.Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Leland', 'P.', 'Fitzgerald', 'making', 'best', 'attempt', 'be', 'apathetic', '1/2', 'bored', '1/2', 'stupid', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'something', 'anything', 'Leland', 'so', 'little', 'not', 'sociopathic', 'way', 'think', 'am', 'supposed', 'find', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Pearl', 'character', 'hero', 'film', 'ultimately', 'just', 'opportunist', 'befriending', 'Leland', 'own', 'purposes', 'not', 'caring', 'Leland', 'students.Maybe', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'Allen', 'hero', 'ultimate', 'victim', 'circumstance', 'film', 'maybe', 'real', 'tragedy', 'film', 'second', 'only', 'Ryan', 'murder', 'victim', 'dead.But', 'movie', 'IMO', 'ultimate', 'flaw', 'movie', 'can', 'succumb', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'players', 'moral', 'Matthew', 'Ryan', 'Hoge', 'writer', 'director', 'trying', 'get', 'about', 'people', 'being', 'flawed', 'being', 'too', 'damn', 'hard', 'be', 'good', 'person', 'time', 'lost', 'Just', 'saying', 'end', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'believe', 'have', ""n't"", 'felt', 'loss', 'Ryan', 'parents', 'have', ""n't"", 'felt', 'anguish', 'Ryan', 'sisters', 'least', 'think', 'are', 'sisters', 'step', 'sisters', 'who', 'can', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Leland', 'confusion', 'Allen', 'disappointment', 'anything', 'characters.Lena', 'Olin', 'Leland', 'mother', 'think', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'important', 'character', 'beginning', 'literally', 'film', 'sadly', 'only', 'person', 'film.I', 'disagree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'must', 'see', 'fans', 'independent', 'films', 'lure', 'independent', 'films', 'been', 'stories', 'people', 'example', 'regular', 'people', 'living', 'regular', 'lives', 'finding', 'bored', 'sleepless', 'Tokyo', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'characters', 'finding', 'interest', 'people', 'being', 'different', 'people', 'just', 'exist', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'learn', 'anything', 'characters', 'tell', 'something', 'performances', 'are', 'fine', 'maybe', 'received', 'little', 'director', 'what', 'were', 'supposed', 'convey', 'how', 'were', 'supposed', 'feel', 'maybe', 'Mr.', 'Hoge', 'thought', 'would', 'come', 'together', 'end', 'Stringing', 'together', 'events', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'story', 'matter', 'try', 'lead', 'surprising', 'shocking', 'ending']",N/A
834551,ABF9TML1GLCJ6,B0002I8372,Luca,"[38, 44]","The premise is rather simple. A teenager, awkward, introvert and burdened with a sensibility that sears his heart to numbness, commits an inexplicable murder. An atrocious one at that. The victim is his girlfriend's brother, Bryan, who is an 11 year old severely autistic nonentity. The main role of Leland Fitzgerald is interpreted by Ryan Gosling with such compelling anguish that it magnifies the complexity of a fragile spirit to such a degree we cannot psychologize the troubled youth because we are disoriented as we observe the indomitable suffering Leland attempts to silence. Likewise we are given a stark visual of the two sets of parents, the questions that harrow them and the way the tragedy unravels what seemed to be a world pulling at the seams of every thread.The emotionally detached Leland retraces his steps thanks to the invasive insistance of his juvenile hall educator Pearl Madison, admirably played by Don Cheadle, who is undergoing moral dilemmas of his own. Pearl's feigned confidence is contrasted with confounding and disarming depth to Leland's innocent aloofness. The emotional texture of the movie is further enriched by strands of a narrative that follows Bryan's other sister who is unsettled and dejected, an 18 year old who is not allowed to search and delve within her own turbulance. She breaks up with her boyfriend, he too a timid soul reaching for a stability that teeters on the brink of injected scrupolousness. If you then add the torpor and emotional sterility that Leland's dad, an accomplished bestselling author whose fame rests on his descriptive novels that indemnify suburbia, you have in focus a portrait of such a philosophical, psychological and ethical intensity undeniably impressive, expressive and teeming with the brute force that sterilizes our lives as it designates its shallow characteristics. Much more may well be added in terms of the narrative, for it deploys innumerable details that trace a perspective that becomes dissolved just when it seems to have become solidified most. The director, Matthew Ryan Hoge, frames the movie in such a way as to mesmerize the viewer through the autopsy of a society that in the wake of a murder discovers how much everything else is dead within. The motion-sickness tremble of the photographic ambiance of these quivering soulscapes, given full force, reaches a climactic burst when things seem to make sense again and our code of ethics reinstated with trust. It is in that precise moment that a second murder makes the depth of the movie's conscience become too vast for imperatives of psychology or social commentary. The movie stirs, moves, and shocks, but best of all it illuminates the pain of lives gone numb and that dorment force that craves reawakening.",5,The Ethics of Pain,1215388800,"07 7, 2008",2008,2767,"['premise', 'rather', 'simple', 'teenager', 'awkward', 'introvert', 'burdened', 'sensibility', 'heart', 'numbness', 'inexplicable', 'murder', 'atrocious', 'one', 'victim', 'girlfriend', 'brother', 'Bryan', 'who', '11', 'year', 'old', 'severely', 'autistic', 'nonentity', 'main', 'role', 'Leland', 'Fitzgerald', 'interpreted', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'such', 'compelling', 'anguish', 'complexity', 'fragile', 'spirit', 'degree', 'can', 'not', 'psychologize', 'troubled', 'youth', 'are', 'disoriented', 'observe', 'indomitable', 'suffering', 'Leland', 'silence', 'Likewise', 'are', 'given', 'stark', 'visual', 'two', 'sets', 'parents', 'questions', 'harrow', 'way', 'tragedy', 'unravels', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'world', 'pulling', 'seams', 'thread.The', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'Leland', 'steps', 'thanks', 'invasive', 'insistance', 'juvenile', 'hall', 'educator', 'Pearl', 'Madison', 'admirably', 'played', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'who', 'undergoing', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'own', 'Pearl', 'feigned', 'confidence', 'contrasted', 'confounding', 'disarming', 'depth', 'Leland', 'innocent', 'aloofness', 'emotional', 'texture', 'movie', 'further', 'enriched', 'strands', 'narrative', 'Bryan', 'other', 'sister', 'who', 'unsettled', 'dejected', '18', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'not', 'allowed', 'search', 'delve', 'own', 'turbulance', 'up', 'boyfriend', 'too', 'timid', 'soul', 'reaching', 'stability', 'teeters', 'brink', 'injected', 'scrupolousness', 'then', 'add', 'torpor', 'emotional', 'sterility', 'Leland', 'dad', 'accomplished', 'bestselling', 'author', 'fame', 'descriptive', 'novels', 'indemnify', 'suburbia', 'have', 'focus', 'portrait', 'such', 'philosophical', 'psychological', 'ethical', 'intensity', 'undeniably', 'impressive', 'expressive', 'teeming', 'brute', 'force', 'lives', 'shallow', 'characteristics', 'Much', 'more', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'added', 'terms', 'narrative', 'innumerable', 'details', 'trace', 'perspective', 'dissolved', 'just', 'when', 'have', 'become', 'solidified', 'most', 'director', 'Matthew', 'Ryan', 'Hoge', 'movie', 'such', 'way', 'mesmerize', 'viewer', 'autopsy', 'society', 'wake', 'murder', 'how', 'much', 'everything', 'else', 'dead', 'motion-sickness', 'tremble', 'photographic', 'ambiance', 'quivering', 'soulscapes', 'given', 'full', 'force', 'climactic', 'burst', 'when', 'things', 'seem', 'make', 'sense', 'again', 'code', 'ethics', 'reinstated', 'trust', 'precise', 'moment', 'second', 'murder', 'depth', 'movie', 'conscience', 'become', 'too', 'vast', 'imperatives', 'psychology', 'social', 'commentary', 'movie', 'stirs', 'moves', 'shocks', 'best', 'pain', 'lives', 'gone', 'numb', 'dorment', 'force', 'reawakening']",N/A

From the get go, from that sad sappy music, to that pathetic look on Leland's face and so on, I just didn't care much for these people.  This movie felt like a Hollywood-Indie, which is a contradiction in terms.  Certain scenes were cliche and just plain stupid: Leland being taken into police custody with a reporter running up yelling ""Did you do it?""  And what do we get?  The nice officer pausing his arresting duties long enough for Leland to gaze into the camera with a depressed, dead stare that truly must reflect how his soul feels.  BARF!!  Or how about when the cops are taking Leland up to the jailhouse and they pause on the steps just long enough for the dead kid's father to contimplate wether or not he should shoot Leland (I doubt they'd pause there in real life, and I also doubt no one would notice the victim's father standing there with his hand in his pocket, and I think that they'd prolly put an armor vest on Leland to make sure no one DID shoot him, but that's just me...)  What else can I complain about?  Plenty:What kind of father, upon hearing his pre-pubescent son has decided to just hang out in New York city instead of going to Paris would say, ""Hey son, that's a neat thing for you to do!"" Even if the father didn't care for his son, surely he would care how much trouble he'd get into with his wife and the law for letting that happen.So, he kills the kid one day, and the next he's already in the Juvi-center taking a history class?  Sure...For a heroin junky, that kid that Jena Malone's character (I can't recall her name) went away with sure wasn't very skinny, pale, sickly-looking or any of those other traits normally associated with heroin abuse.  Perhaps the writer should have chosen a better drug to have them hooked on, like cocaine.  Good writers and directors should be sure to avoid cliches and focus on little details like this.The whole movie I noticed one really annoything thing about Leland:  HE'S A RETARD!  I know he's supposed to be ""lost"" and ""confused"" and in a state of depression (yet he's the wisest one out of all the characters, isn't that nice?) but he seriously comes off as a mildly retarded young man, or a just plain stupid kid.  That sad-sack look on his face through the whole movie was pathetic and made me wanna see Leland get smacked or shanked or whatever.  Basically, this movie wasn't believable, I didn't care about the characters, and it just seemed like a waste of time and effort on the part of all those involved, including the viewer.",1,Wow...,1118275200,"06 9, 2005",2005,2653,"['movie', 'was', 'really', 'waste', 'time', 'guess', 'whole', 'premise', 'good', 'one', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'least', 'get', 'go', 'sad', 'sappy', 'music', 'pathetic', 'look', 'Leland', 'face', 'so', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'people', 'movie', 'felt', 'Hollywood-Indie', 'contradiction', 'terms', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'were', 'cliche', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'Leland', 'being', 'taken', 'police', 'custody', 'reporter', 'running', 'up', 'yelling', 'Did', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'nice', 'officer', 'pausing', 'arresting', 'duties', 'long', 'enough', 'Leland', 'gaze', 'camera', 'depressed', 'dead', 'stare', 'truly', 'must', 'reflect', 'how', 'soul', 'feels', 'BARF', 'how', 'when', 'cops', 'are', 'taking', 'Leland', 'up', 'jailhouse', 'pause', 'steps', 'just', 'long', 'enough', 'dead', 'kid', 'father', 'contimplate', 'wether', 'not', 'should', 'shoot', 'Leland', 'doubt', ""'d"", 'pause', 'there', 'real', 'life', 'also', 'doubt', 'one', 'would', 'notice', 'victim', 'father', 'standing', 'there', 'hand', 'pocket', 'think', ""'d"", 'prolly', 'put', 'armor', 'vest', 'Leland', 'make', 'sure', 'one', 'DID', 'just', 'What', 'else', 'can', 'complain', 'Plenty', 'What', 'kind', 'father', 'hearing', 'pre-pubescent', 'son', 'decided', 'just', 'hang', 'out', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'instead', 'going', 'Paris', 'would', 'say', 'Hey', 'son', 'neat', 'thing', 'do', 'Even', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'son', 'surely', 'would', 'care', 'how', 'much', 'trouble', ""'d"", 'get', 'wife', 'law', 'letting', 'happen.So', 'kid', 'one', 'day', 'next', 'already', 'Juvi-center', 'taking', 'history', 'class', 'Sure', 'heroin', 'junky', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'name', 'went', 'away', 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'skinny', 'pale', 'sickly-looking', 'other', 'traits', 'normally', 'associated', 'heroin', 'abuse', 'Perhaps', 'writer', 'should', 'have', 'chosen', 'better', 'drug', 'have', 'hooked', 'cocaine', 'Good', 'writers', 'directors', 'should', 'be', 'sure', 'avoid', 'cliches', 'focus', 'little', 'details', 'this.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'noticed', 'one', 'really', 'annoything', 'thing', 'Leland', 'HE', 'A', 'RETARD', 'know', 'supposed', 'be', 'lost', 'confused', 'state', 'depression', 'yet', 'wisest', 'one', 'out', 'characters', ""n't"", 'nice', 'seriously', 'off', 'mildly', 'retarded', 'young', 'man', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'kid', 'sad-sack', 'look', 'face', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'pathetic', 'made', 'wan', 'see', 'Leland', 'get', 'smacked', 'shanked', 'Basically', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'believable', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'just', 'seemed', 'waste', 'time', 'effort', 'part', 'involved', 'including', 'viewer']",N/A
834553,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B0002I8372,M. Burns,"[6, 26]","Watching The United States of Leland tonight, I was still hanging on by the tiniest thread at the halfway point in the movie. Sure, I hated what I was seeing, despised every hoity-toity, derivative word of dialogue, and wished I could slap the puppy-dog grin off actor Ryan Gosling's tortured little face, BUT I had nothing better to do at 10:20 on a Friday night. That is, I was hanging on by a thread until it sunk in what a hilarious movie it really was...and then the laughter came. And it wouldn't stop. I would look up on the screen, see two characters about whom I cared nothing, listen to their angry-13-year-old girl dialogue (this movie was written by a grown man, mind you) and then torrents of snickers started flowing. And kept flowing. Ladies and gentlemen, The United States of Leland stands as the first movie where I've had to leave the theater to get myself together - and it's a drama about a senseless murder and the lives that it affects.Ryan Gosling has the kind of fiery intensity inside of him that can either be brought to brilliant fruition or squandered like there's no tomorrow, and it becomes very obvious within the first moments of Leland that the latter will be the case. Every comment, every gesture, every action that his title character makes stems back to this wounded puppy dog look that he plasters on like it's something profound. He stares out windows, he looks deep into a fishtank, the dude contemplates everything - but what comes out in voice-overs that guide the film is the drivel of an angsty teenager who hides under his bed and scribbles emo lyrics into a journal. The main problem with the main character of the film here is that this dude does some serious stuff - murdering a retarded child - and some kind of understanding of him (I don't ask for much) is really needed to ground the film. Writer/director Matthew Ryan Hoge, though, makes him this cypher who tells his maudlin, Dawson's Creeki-esque story to a little journal while he's incarcerated. A particularly funny little gem of bad screenwriting is the first thing he pens: ""I know what they want from me.""And we're supposed to care about the people in this movie who walk in and out of it like just what they are: badly written characters. There's the retarded kid who gets about 10 seconds of screen time, so who really cares that he's dead? Then there's Leland's girlfriend, played by Jena Malone, who battles a heroin addiction and likes having boys whisper ""Everything's going to be okay"" into her ear. Oh, and Kevin Spacey pops in for a cute little cameo as a jerk famous writer (who happens to be Leland's father). Then there's Don Cheadle, who plays a teacher in the jail who takes a selfish interest in Leland, therefore giving him the opportunity to spout whiney, pointless drivel about all the sadness in the world and how he sees it in everyone. There are some other characters, like the rest of the family of the dead kid, but who cares about them because they get tossed around in the movie like the director has no idea what he's doing. Oh wait! He doesn't!Why is this movie so bad? Well, I think I have it figured out. There are bad movies, like Anger Management and Legally Blonde 2: Red, White, and Blonde - and I dislike them with a passion. They may have a little something to say, but what they really want you to see is Jack Nicholson farting naked in bed and a cute little chihuahua that matches its owner. This movie, though, wants to explore real issues, and that's where it commits the gravest sin of them all - wanting to discuss real things about life, but exploiting them to the max just to write cheesey dialogue that sounds enlightened. The sensless murder of a retarded child is not an issue that should be taken lightly, and I really think that this movie could have been put in the right hands (with a COMPLETELY different script) and been meaningful. Director M.R. Hoge and producer Kevin Spacey, though, care about nothing more than taking some difficult subject matter and then manipulating you, the viewer, with background guitar music and awful acting. And it's laughable. That's right - hilarious. It's such a trainwreck it's almost unbelievable anyone even gave this the greenlight. Let alone talented actors (and Spacey as a producer!!!) who are so much better than this disgusting script and maudlin plot development.I honestly didn't know how this disaster could have possibly ended, but it didn't disappoint, let me tell you. The final plot tie-up of the film elevates it to even more horrible than the the American Beauty, Dawson's Creek rip-off that is. A supporting character who had hardly been developed at all throughout the movie comes in and completes the course of the action and then Gosling finishes up the movie with some ham-handed monologue that, in so many words, tries to bring some kind of justification to his actions. And it offended me. At first, I thought it was a stunted script. Then I realized it was an unintentionally funny movie. And finally Leland becomes a morally offensive, despicable wreck of a movie that should have never been made. By the end of those excruciating 108 minutes, I had laughed myself out of the theater, tried to touch my nose with my tongue, and attempted to crawl into the fetal position. Oh, I also hoped that some natural disaster would tear the roof from the Drexel and send me sailing into the night far away from the movie. You'd be surprised how close I am to touching my nose with my tongue - at least those 108 minutes weren't a complete waste of time.

834557,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0002I8372,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","The United States of Leland (Matthew Ryan Hoge, 2003)Now, this is the kind of mystery I'm usually fond of; we open with the crime itself, out of context, inexplicable: Leland P. Fitzgerald (The Believer's Ryan Gosling) kills Ryan Pollard (Michael Welch, soon to be seen in the upcoming Day of the Dead remake). Other than that, we know nothing, and the real mystery of the movie is not what happened, but why. In charge of figuring that out is Pearl (Hotel Rwanda's Don Cheadle), a teacher in the juvenile facility to which Leland is sent. Of course, Pearl is not supposed to be figuring this out; in fact, as with all great crime dramas, his boss Elden (character actor Ron Canada, probably best remembered for his role on the short-lived, but brilliant, TV series Murder One) has expressly forbidden him to see Leland out of class. Not that that stops Pearl, of course. And there are all sorts of things littered throughout Leland's past to point the way. The question is, which of these things, if any, contributed to the crime?This is good, meaty stuff, and Hoge lined up a stellar cast to work with it; aside from Gosling and Cheadle, the cast features Kevin Spacey, Lena Olin, Jena Malone, Ann Magnuson, and Sherilyn Fenn, and I haven't gotten past the first scrolling screen of credits. The problem is that no one with the exception of Gosling has much of a part to play, and so people just kind of wander on and off the set leaving clues as if that were their only purpose. (Which, of course, it might be.) Hoge attempts to spice things up with a subplot involving Pearl, his seemingly nonexistent girlfriend, and the new girl in the administration office, but with the exception of one scene, it seems extraneous.It's worth watching for the performances-- there is a lot of quality starpower to be had in this movie-- but the script could have used a reworking or two before filming started. ** ",3,"Tries, doesn't quite get there.",1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,1904,"['United', 'States', 'Leland', 'Matthew', 'Ryan', 'Hoge', '2003', 'Now', 'kind', 'mystery', ""'m"", 'usually', 'fond', 'open', 'crime', 'context', 'inexplicable', 'Leland', 'P.', 'Fitzgerald', 'Believer', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Ryan', 'Pollard', 'Michael', 'Welch', 'soon', 'be', 'seen', 'upcoming', 'Day', 'Dead', 'remake', 'Other', 'know', 'nothing', 'real', 'mystery', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'charge', 'figuring', 'out', 'Pearl', 'Hotel', 'Rwanda', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'teacher', 'juvenile', 'facility', 'Leland', 'sent', 'course', 'Pearl', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'figuring', 'out', 'fact', 'great', 'crime', 'dramas', 'boss', 'Elden', 'character', 'actor', 'Ron', 'Canada', 'probably', 'best', 'remembered', 'role', 'short-lived', 'brilliant', 'TV', 'series', 'Murder', 'One', 'expressly', 'forbidden', 'see', 'Leland', 'class', 'Not', 'Pearl', 'course', 'are', 'sorts', 'things', 'littered', 'Leland', 'past', 'point', 'way', 'question', 'things', 'contributed', 'crime', 'good', 'meaty', 'stuff', 'Hoge', 'lined', 'up', 'stellar', 'cast', 'work', 'aside', 'Gosling', 'Cheadle', 'cast', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Ann', 'Magnuson', 'Sherilyn', 'Fenn', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'first', 'scrolling', 'screen', 'credits', 'problem', 'one', 'exception', 'Gosling', 'much', 'part', 'play', 'so', 'people', 'just', 'kind', 'wander', 'set', 'leaving', 'clues', 'were', 'only', 'purpose', 'Which', 'course', 'might', 'be', 'Hoge', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Pearl', 'seemingly', 'nonexistent', 'girlfriend', 'new', 'girl', 'administration', 'office', 'exception', 'one', 'scene', 'extraneous.It', 'worth', 'watching', 'performances', 'lot', 'quality', 'starpower', 'be', 'had', 'movie', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'reworking', 'two', 'filming', 'started', '**']",N/A
834558,AS0L0O98NZ4SG,B0002I8372,S. Cameron,"[0, 0]","THE UNITED STATES OF LELAND centers around the mellow, rather indifferent youth that is Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling), who has just murdered the mentally retarded brother of his girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone) for what appears to be no reason whatsoever. He keeps telling people he doesn't remember why he did it, and he doesn't even remember very much of the incident itself, other than little details like how the sun felt on the back of his neck. Okay, you're thinking. He's crazy. But what writer/director Matthew Ryan Hoge wanted to convey to us was the story of a young visionary, who went a little crazy over all the hurt and sadness he saw in people's eyes and wanted to end the sadness of his victim, Ryan. This is all fine and good as it ties in with the moral of the story - that even through the sadness, even through the mistakes, there is a goodness in people - but it comes over a bit pretentious as Gosling's character sits there and preaches in his annoyingly soft-spoken monologues, while keeping his face completely void of all emotion. I'm sorry, but you don't see very many fifteen-year-old visionaries that talk about the sadness of the world. And Hoge pulled that old trick where the adults learn something from the youth, because the youth is unjaded by adult sadness or out of the mouths of babes, blah blah blah whatever. Been there, seen that.Detention center teacher Pearl (played very well by Don Cheadle), an aspiring writer trapped in a sticky web of dead creativity, finds a novel idea in Leland and decides to conduct clandestine sessions with the teenager, hoping to unravel a motive and learn a little about the people that played into the tragedy. He is one of the many characters in the movie that wrestles with mistakes, but gives into them anyway with the excuse that he is ""only human."" In one of the only parts of the movie I wouldn't call pretentious, Leland calls him out on this, saying, ""It's funny how people only say that after they've done something wrong."" Girlfriend Becky has fallen into heroin abuse; Becky's college-bound sister Julie (Michelle Williams) wrestles with whether or not she should tell her boyfriend Allen (Chris Klein, in an unexpectedly great role) that she doesn't want to continue their relationship into college; and Leland's detached novelist father (Kevin Spacey) tries to ignore the fact that he is neglecting his son. The supporting cast is great in their portrayal of good people trying to do the right thing and failing, only to continue trying for the sake of it. And while Ryan Gosling allows clammed-up Leland to spread his wings a little and open up, for the most part the character remains frustratingly bland.It's a good movie, well worth watching, with good character development, morals, and great acting - and though the climax isn't very exciting, it's surprising and brings everything full circle - but if I had to live in the United States of Leland every day, I'd emigrate.",4,"""I'm only human.""",1150588800,"06 18, 2006",2006,2969,"['UNITED', 'STATES', 'OF', 'LELAND', 'centers', 'mellow', 'rather', 'indifferent', 'youth', 'Leland', 'P.', 'Fitzgerald', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'who', 'just', 'murdered', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'brother', 'girlfriend', 'Becky', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'what', 'be', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'telling', 'people', ""n't"", 'remember', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'very', 'much', 'incident', 'other', 'little', 'details', 'how', 'sun', 'felt', 'back', 'neck', 'Okay', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'crazy', 'what', 'writer/director', 'Matthew', 'Ryan', 'Hoge', 'wanted', 'convey', 'was', 'story', 'young', 'visionary', 'who', 'went', 'little', 'crazy', 'hurt', 'sadness', 'saw', 'people', 'eyes', 'wanted', 'end', 'sadness', 'victim', 'Ryan', 'fine', 'good', 'moral', 'story', 'even', 'sadness', 'even', 'mistakes', 'goodness', 'people', 'over', 'bit', 'pretentious', 'Gosling', 'character', 'there', 'preaches', 'annoyingly', 'soft-spoken', 'monologues', 'keeping', 'face', 'completely', 'emotion', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'very', 'many', 'fifteen-year-old', 'visionaries', 'talk', 'sadness', 'world', 'Hoge', 'pulled', 'old', 'trick', 'where', 'adults', 'learn', 'something', 'youth', 'youth', 'unjaded', 'adult', 'sadness', 'mouths', 'babes', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'Been', 'there', 'seen', 'that.Detention', 'center', 'teacher', 'Pearl', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'trapped', 'sticky', 'web', 'dead', 'creativity', 'novel', 'idea', 'Leland', 'conduct', 'clandestine', 'sessions', 'teenager', 'hoping', 'unravel', 'motive', 'learn', 'little', 'people', 'played', 'tragedy', 'one', 'many', 'characters', 'movie', 'mistakes', 'anyway', 'excuse', 'only', 'human', 'one', 'only', 'parts', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'pretentious', 'Leland', 'out', 'saying', 'funny', 'how', 'people', 'only', 'say', ""'ve"", 'done', 'something', 'wrong', 'Girlfriend', 'Becky', 'fallen', 'heroin', 'abuse', 'Becky', 'college-bound', 'sister', 'Julie', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'not', 'should', 'tell', 'boyfriend', 'Allen', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'unexpectedly', 'great', 'role', ""n't"", 'want', 'continue', 'relationship', 'college', 'Leland', 'detached', 'novelist', 'father', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'ignore', 'fact', 'neglecting', 'son', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'portrayal', 'good', 'people', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'failing', 'only', 'continue', 'trying', 'sake', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'clammed-up', 'Leland', 'spread', 'wings', 'little', 'open', 'up', 'most', 'part', 'character', 'frustratingly', 'bland.It', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'morals', 'great', 'acting', 'climax', ""n't"", 'very', 'exciting', 'surprising', 'everything', 'full', 'circle', 'had', 'live', 'United', 'States', 'Leland', 'day', ""'d"", 'emigrate']",N/A

Instead, there's the somewhat compassionate, somewhat opportunistic Pearl Madison, played by Don Cheadle. Sometimes I wasn't sure if Cheadle was doing a really good job playing someone who is conflicted, or if his regret for signing up for this film was bleeding through on screen.The film is similar to ""Mystery Men"" in a way, though; the filmmakers assembled a talented production crew, and a cast of some of my favorite actors (including Kevin Spacey -- also one of the film's prodcuers) and put them in one of the most frustrating films I've ever sat through.I guess I'm just really tired of small movies about suburban life with fey, disembodied narrators spouting out random aphorisms and non sequitors. I wouldn't mind so much if the film was able to deliver some sort of epiphany, but it doesn't. When the credits rolled, the only thing I was thinking about was a guy who'd stabbed his girlfriend's retarded brother, and writer/director Matthew Hoge asking, ""What's that?"" I may as well have watched ""Elephant"" again.If exploring suburban angst is your thing, you might like this film. There are better cooked stories out there, though. I watched Larry Clark's ""Ken Park"" afterward, which was like ""The United States of Leland"" in a less wealthy neighborhood. Both films were depressing, but I felt so gross after I watched ""Ken Park"" I promptly returned it to the video store, showered and cleaned my whole apartment. At least I was shocked into action. ""The United States of Leland"" just had me crawling back into bed.The soundtrack is okay. The score is by Sunny Day Real Estate's Jeremy Enigk.

While the story has some tremendous performances, it really lacks any substance, rehashing the events of the past week, over and over again. We know right from the beginning of the film, that Leland killed a retard boy, what we don't know is why. The focus of the film is discovering what lead this highly intelligent, son of a celebrity, to commit such an act. The film has a huge cast of celebrities, that include Don Cheadle, Kevin Spacey, Chris Klein, and Michelle Williams, all of whom are as good as you would expect. What the film has in talent, it lacks in substance, as it's really just a whole lot of Leland talking in code. The writers go out of their way to show Leland as this deep, emotionless kid, that's been trapped inside his own mind his entire life. As the film goes on, the more Leland opens up. The writers paint the portrait of this kid and show you ever aspect of his life, in the hopes that you will figure out his true motivation before it comes out. The result is a slow moving film that causes the audience to gradually lose interest as time goes on. There is no doubt the Ryan Gosling was spectacular and deserves every good thing said about his performance, but the story seems to move slowly and in circles.

834561,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0002I8372,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","With all respect, I must say that I find 'The United Staes of Leland' is a much flawed film with too many characters and fraught dialogues.  It is made with good intention, but I don't think its initial motive is not fulfilled.I read Matthew Ryan Hoge, writer/director of the film, was once a teacher of a juvenile detention facility, and you can see it's true easily.  The film starts with a mild-mannered boy Leland (Ryan Gosling) sent to the facility where a teacher (and aspiring writer) Pearl (Don Cheadle) is assigned the job to teach him.  Leland killed an autistic boy with a knife, without obvious reasons, and still does not know why he commited the murder himself.So far, the film is great.  Then things become slow -- I mean too slow for me to get to know these people.  The film does not offer an easy answer for the killing, and that is not a disappointment.  The wrong decision is taken when we see too many sub-plots introduced into the film, which should have concentrated on Leland, his family, the teacher, or the killed boy.If you think my review is cruel (and it is, I know), see this list.  Besides Gosling and Cheadle, you will see Lena Olin (Leland's mother), Kevin Spacey (his detached father, and co-producer of the film), Jena Malone as the sister of the killed boy, Chris Klein as her love, Michelle Williams as her sister, Martin Donovan as her father, plus Ann Magnuson and Sherilyn Fenn, the latter's role, sorry, I forgot.While we even do not know much about them, the story goes on, including even the infidelty of the teacher, drug use of one character, and ANOTHER killing of which meaning I still do not understand.  After the cold relations between Leland and the father is suggested, the episode about the teacher cheating on his love is shown -- why not take one of them, this case the first story, and delve into it?I know it's a well-intentioned film, and I respect the intention, but with this script crowded with characters, you just cannot make an involving one.",2,"Well-Intentioned, But Overcrowded with Characters",1094428800,"09 6, 2004",2004,2006,"['respect', 'must', 'say', 'find', ""'The"", 'United', 'Staes', 'Leland', 'much', 'flawed', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'fraught', 'dialogues', 'made', 'good', 'intention', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'initial', 'motive', 'not', 'fulfilled.I', 'read', 'Matthew', 'Ryan', 'Hoge', 'writer/director', 'film', 'was', 'once', 'teacher', 'juvenile', 'detention', 'facility', 'can', 'see', 'true', 'easily', 'film', 'mild-mannered', 'boy', 'Leland', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'sent', 'facility', 'where', 'teacher', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'Pearl', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'assigned', 'job', 'teach', 'Leland', 'killed', 'autistic', 'boy', 'knife', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'still', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'commited', 'murder', 'himself.So', 'far', 'film', 'great', 'Then', 'things', 'become', 'slow', 'mean', 'too', 'slow', 'get', 'know', 'people', 'film', 'not', 'offer', 'easy', 'answer', 'killing', 'not', 'disappointment', 'wrong', 'decision', 'taken', 'when', 'see', 'too', 'many', 'sub-plots', 'introduced', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'concentrated', 'Leland', 'family', 'teacher', 'killed', 'boy.If', 'think', 'review', 'cruel', 'know', 'see', 'list', 'Gosling', 'Cheadle', 'will', 'see', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'Leland', 'mother', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'detached', 'father', 'co-producer', 'film', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'sister', 'killed', 'boy', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'love', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'sister', 'Martin', 'Donovan', 'father', 'Ann', 'Magnuson', 'Sherilyn', 'Fenn', 'latter', 'role', 'sorry', 'forgot.While', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'story', 'including', 'even', 'infidelty', 'teacher', 'drug', 'use', 'one', 'character', 'ANOTHER', 'killing', 'meaning', 'still', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'cold', 'relations', 'Leland', 'father', 'suggested', 'episode', 'teacher', 'cheating', 'love', 'shown', 'why', 'not', 'take', 'one', 'case', 'first', 'story', 'delve', 'know', 'well-intentioned', 'film', 'respect', 'intention', 'script', 'crowded', 'characters', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'involving', 'one']",N/A
