1326450,AQJAILPTX1DB2,B0035JHYIY,Anonymous,"[1, 1]","Stephanie Cole (who plays the role of the aging Ms. Diana Trent) is the heart of this series, and a HEART she definitely has!!  She delivers great punch lines with ease and grace, and carries the series with aplomb!!  You won't necessarily recognize her, but she is the same actress who played ""Auntie Joan"" in the early seasons of the hit sit-com titled ""Doc Martin"", but it is she!Loved this series when it was aired fairly regularly on our local PBS channel, but it is not shown much anymore, so decided to purchase the entire five-season set on Amazon recently when it was on sale for about $44.Description on the Amazon website, as well as on the box set, says it has subtitles, but when I checked ALL the discs, discovered  subtitles available ONLY on four of the five-season set.  Season One does NOT have subtitles and is recorded with monaural sound.  Seasons Two through Five, however, have clear white subtitles you can choose to have on or off, and the sound is recorded in stereo.  Video quality is poorest in Season One, but it is okay.  The other four seasons have better picture quality, especially if you use an up-scaling blu-ray player.Since I'm sort of a British sitcom ""junkie,"" I reserve praise for those that really deliver quality laughs, and this one does!",4,Good Laughs!!

1326458,A2EIKI4ZYV8VU7,B0035JHYIY,"D. K. Hingle ""justkes""","[63, 63]","The WHOLE THING in ONE SET!!!  About time, too!""Waiting for God"" became a favourite from the moment I first saw an episode.  (It was ""The Spiritualist"" from Season Four.)  A friend sat me down and told me, ""You WILL watch this.""  I met Tom, Diana, Harvey, Jane, Geoffrey, and Marian.Don't let the title put you off, it has nothing to do with religion or dying and everything to do with life and living.  The series is set in the Bayview Retirement Community in Bournemouth, England.  The place is run by Harvey ""The Idiot"" Baines, with the help of his side-kick Jane Edwards.  When a new inmate - er, resident - Tom Ballard checks in, he moves in next to Diana Trent.  Tom is a widower with one son (according to Diana, he's thick as a plank) and a daughter-in-law (""and she's something out of the Twilight Zone,"" also according to Diana).  Tom was an accountant for 40 years, and when he becomes bored he tends to let his mind wander into his own imaginary world, populated by B-Movies and their plots.  Diana, on the other hand, is a spinster - proud of it - who was a prize-winning wartime photojournalist.  Together, Tom & Diana keep things at Bayview stirred up, so much so that Harvey spends the entire five year run of the show trying to chuck them both out.  (The show never made it to the US, but if it had my idea of ""Dream Casting"" would have been Harvey Korman & Bea Arthur.  Acid wit meets silliness.)Graham Crowden and Stephanie Cole are superb as the troublesome twosome. (Ironically, Ms. Cole had to be aged for the part, which she took on when she was about 50 years old.)  Daniel Hill plays Baines, and Janine Duvitski plays Jane. Jane is smitten with Harvey, and Harvey thinks his ideal woman sits on tractors in bikinis.  Once in a while Jane decides it's hopeless and tries to become a nun.  Harvey, who is totally inept, can't run the place without her.  GeoffreyThe writing is sharp and well-paced.  The show tackles many problems of aging (prostate problems, adult-onset diabetes, loneliness, the scams perpetrated on aging, and others) with taste and laughs.  THE SERIES IS A WHOLE STORY WITH A BEGINNING, A MIDDLE, AND AN END.  Start at the beginning and keep going until the end.  Prepare for laughing out loud.  Several episodes may cause soreness to ribs from doing so:  the trip to Brighton in season one, the scandal in season three, and the last four episodes of season five.  The set includes the two Christmas specials, and hopefully some extra features.It took YEARS for this wonderful series to appear on DVD.  Fans eagerly bought up each season, fearing it would be the last released.  NOW comes the full series all in one go!  If you count the number of discs in the individual seasons, you come up with SEVEN.  The count on this set says EIGHT, and the cover artwork actually says NINE.  So, we may be faced with a dilemma: keep buying the individual seasons or go for it and get the whole set.  Your choice.  If you haven't gotten the seasons as they were released, go for this set.The point is, everyone should visit Bayview.

Tom Ballard (Graham Crowden) is a happy go lucky guy who is being sent to a retirement community by his son Geoffrey and constantly drunk or worse daughter in law Marion because they can't deal with him any more (always in a fantasy world, and ""other problems"" that come with age). At Bayview, he is neighbored by Diana Trent (Stephanie Cole) who as Tom would say later ""puts the tank in cantankerous"".  An old spinster who is tired of living the life of being unliked, etc. and now wants to live her declining days in peace.  In spite of their differences, this ""oddball couple"", find common ground, a disgust for the way their ""home"" is being run by royal pain in the......(you fill in the blank with the word of your choice) Harvey Baines (Daniel Hill) and his equally ditzy assistant Jane Edwards (Janine Duvitsky) who (God only knows why) is smitten with the blithering idiot.

This gem was released on DVD in England between 2006 and 2007, but Warner in their deal with BBC Video, has been releasing them here one at a time for the last 4 years, the 5th set being released the same day as this complete set (ironically the other 4 were all released at the same time each year since 2006).  As I see it, nothing extra will be in the complete collection, that is not in the separate releases. The 3rd and 4th sets include Christmas Specials made during those seasons. If you waited for all 5 sets to be out to buy, then get this set as (like other BBC Video releases here) it will be a better deal, than the 5 individuals.

Diana Trench, a 60+ photo journalist during the war(s) filming in Asia, meets a 40 year retired accountant.  He's sweet with a twist, she's fierce with a heart of gold underneath, both intelligent and 'crazy like foxes', to show his idiot son (with a sociopathic alcoholic wife), her wonderful niece and the administration of Bayview, that being old does not mean, putting up with being treated like children. I will be buying this show very soon, it is a tonic for my husband and I who are disabled and know full well what being marginalized is about, and how we all need a Diana and Tom in our lives.
