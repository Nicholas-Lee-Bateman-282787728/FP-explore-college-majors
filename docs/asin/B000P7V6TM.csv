1069268,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B000P7V6TM,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 3]","THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS (BBC Film for Masterpiece Theater, 2006, 98 minutes) is a delightful fully live-action film based on the popular children's book of the same title by Kenneth Grahame. Be cautious - there is what seems to me to be a 'muppet'-style version, as a series no less, and countless other animated versions including one from Disney. THIS live action film courtesy of Masterpiece Theater is the one you really want.Mole (the handsome, charming Lee Ingleby) abandons his spring cleaning and finds himself befriended by Rat (a superb, subtle Mark Gatiss). Together they embark on a leisurely, wonder-filled life of boating up and down the narrow little river. Rat decides it would be nice to visit Toad (Matt Lucas in an interesting modern rendition of Roscoe Arbuckle) at Toad Hall. His hyperactive, childish temperament seems to be a tonic for most of the animals. When Toad develops a craving for 'motoring' (driving), he manages to wreck his way through seven cars.This is when Rat and Mole decide they must call upon the big boss: Badger (a brilliant Bob Hoskins). Badger, with whom no one trifles, is the only one who can bring Toad back to his few little senses. After one animadventure after another, just beautifully done, Toad ends up in prison with Badger claiming satisfaction that Toad might just learn his lesson -  he'll be in for 20 years! Toad's inevitable escape is hilarious, and a train ride through the night is so masterfully done I enjoyed the film for that alone. The immortal Jim Carter makes a cameo as the kindly engineer.The train escape is not the pinnacle of this multi-pinnacled film. It is truly a masterpiece of comedy, and if you think this film is purely for children, think again ... I've never enjoyed a film like this and rarely enjoyed any film quite this much in the whole of my life. Gatiss' expressions are Buster Keaton-worthy (yes, BK had expressions). Ingleby's sweet innocence is unmatched. Hoskins' Badger is so realistic I think Hoskins must have studied badgers for this role. His bellowing-in-the-distance is fall-down funny.Everyone inhabits their characters beautifully - even the cute little children who play the field mice are a delight. This story teaches many, many lessons: fealty, loyalty, true friendship, endurance and a sense of community. Badger is particularly angry at Toad for his disruptive, rude and wasteful ways. This film relies 100% on acting: there is little makeup and little is needed. As with the great silent film stars, these actors bring the combined forces of their greatness to bear on this story. It is as much for adults as for children.Lessons about bigotry (especially ""from creatures larger than oneself"") and freedom (""what's the point ... if we never really use it?"") are on offer. In the hands of an American cast, this would have been a stupid disaster. In the hands of the British, it's clearly an enjoyable job for them, a true masterful treat for the viewer. Do not confuse this with eitherHarry Potter Years 1 - 5orMiss Potter, though it is reminiscent of both ends of that spectrum.This is a beautiful cinematic time and one of the best films I have ever seen. Don't be a silly ass (Rat's favorite expression): get it for the whole family.With cameos by Imelda Staunton as the Barge Lady, Mary Walsh as the Washerwoman, and as charming Hedgehogs we have the beautiful Andrei Avrinte and Christian Vlad.",5,"""The hour of ...

When producers are forced to boil it down into about 90 minutes a great deal of the substance of the story is lost.  In this version ""The Piper At The Gates of Dawn"" and ""Dulce Domum"" are completely deleted, and some characters like Otter are also missing or barely covered.Nevertheless this is a fine TV production which is faithful to much of the spirit and all of the beauty of the book.  It is set in an Elysian Field of a countryside along a beautiful stream where it always seems to be fair weather.  The primary cast is limited to Mole, Rat, Toad, and Badger, with a number of smaller parts including an appropriately deviant looking group of Weasels and Stoats.  No one wears an animal costume, but the characteristics of each animal is well portrayed: Rat the country middle class gentleman, Toad the nouveau riche upstart, Badger the aristocrat, and Mole the somewhat proletarian but rising fast arriviste.
