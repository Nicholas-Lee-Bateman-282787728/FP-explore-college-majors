That was the case with Watercolors, a beautiful, different gay love story that might as well have been called ""The persistence of memory"". It deals with a successful painter who obsessively recalls images of his first lover, a high-school swimmer who could not cope with his own homosexuality and addiction to drugs and committed suicide.  An impeccable Tye Olson plays the protagonist, both as an adolescent and as an adult.  I have since also bought his only other available movie, ""Tru Loved"".

I have watched a bunch of gay themed movies recently and have for the most part been let down. All the danger has been taken out of gay film making and I find myself feeling estranged from virtually all characters in recent gay film making. This film does nothing to change that. The characters are never developed beyond what is absolutely necessary in order to be struck by the inevitable sentimental tragedy at the end of the 100 or so minutes. Much like a hallmark TV movie, the director stays as far away from asking any questions of the characters and situations they find themselves in as possible without losing the desired effect.That said, the film isn't bad, the production values are better than most, the acting was as impressive as the material would allow, the direction isn't hopeless and the writing is as syrupy as can be (if that floats your boat)All in all, it's not entirely a waste.",4,tv movie of the week...but not bad,1284508800,"09 15, 2010",2010,984,"['settled', 'watch', 'Watercolors', 'last', 'night', 'slight', 'sense', 'trepidation', 'have', 'watched', 'bunch', 'gay', 'themed', 'movies', 'recently', 'have', 'most', 'part', 'been', 'let', 'down', 'danger', 'been', 'taken', 'gay', 'film', 'making', 'find', 'feeling', 'estranged', 'virtually', 'characters', 'recent', 'gay', 'film', 'making', 'film', 'nothing', 'change', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'developed', 'what', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'order', 'be', 'struck', 'inevitable', 'sentimental', 'tragedy', 'end', '100', 'so', 'minutes', 'Much', 'hallmark', 'TV', 'movie', 'director', 'far', 'away', 'asking', 'questions', 'characters', 'situations', 'find', 'possible', 'losing', 'desired', 'effect.That', 'said', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'better', 'most', 'acting', 'was', 'as', 'impressive', 'material', 'would', 'allow', 'direction', ""n't"", 'hopeless', 'writing', 'as', 'syrupy', 'can', 'be', 'boat', 'not', 'entirely', 'waste']",N/A

1332474,A1Y7C52533BA2H,B0038M61J6,Blake Fraina,"[33, 34]","A surprisingly engaging, and clich&eacute; free, tale of first love between a popular high school jock and an effeminate, artistic misfit.The entire story is told as a flashback.  Melancholy artist Danny, at the opening of his first solo exhibit, reminisces about Carter, the swimmer who is the subject in many of his paintings.  The two high school boys are thrown together because their divorced parents are both members of Alcoholics Anonymous.  They strike up a friendship of sorts which leads to a remarkably relaxed flirtation and, ultimately, Danny (Tye Olson) agreeing to help Carter (Kyle Clare) with his English work so that he can continue to compete on the swim team.  Ostensibly, the trade-off is that Carter will model for Danny's figure drawings.  But all of this seems like an excuse for the two to spend time alone undetected by the macho bigots at school.  Their scenes together are a pleasure to watch because both are fairly competent actors with a believable amount of chemistry between them.  The sweet romance that develops is mostly rather innocent, with the long anticipated consummation handled artistically and tastefully.But it isn't for nothing that the filmmaker has them studying Romeo and Juliet in English class.  If you want a happily ever after story - find another movie.Despite being an outcast at school, Danny is actually much more well-adjusted than Carter.  We learn early on that Carter is addicted to prescription pills (presumably stolen from his father) to help him sleep at night, but the full depth of his woes is only revealed as the story moves along.  Don't think this is just about self-acceptance; there are troubling family issues as well.  Clare, the superior actor, handles the character's complexities well and, by the end, I was really broken hearted for him.  Which leads to my only qualm with the story.  Without giving anything away, I felt as if Danny behaved selfishly at the end of the film and that writer/director David Oliveras (perhaps knowing the audience demographic) wanted viewers to sympathize with him and see his behavior as justified.  I may be wrong; perhaps he's suggesting that young love is inherently self-centered and the film's short denouement (depicting the adult Danny with his new love) proves that Danny has finally matured beyond that and learned to care about someone else's feelings as well as his own.  The film as a whole is enjoyable enough that I suggest you watch it and decide for yourself.Story concerns aside, the film is generally well directed.  Considering this was most likely shot on digital video, it has a nice look with some particularly beautiful night shots.  And, in addition to the two young leads, the supporting actors all put in strong performances (even Greg Louganis, overcoming a bit of novelty casting, as the hardnosed swim coach).A very enjoyable addition to the LGBT film genre.

They bond over the fact that they each live with their single parents, both recovering alcoholics.  Though a promising competitive swimmer,  Carter is dealing with health issues and abuse of pain medications.  He is socially backward and doesn't really have any friends, the result of frequent relocations resulting from his father's inability to keep a job.  Danny is soon attracted to the young athlete, who agrees to pose for one of Danny's sketches, providing Danny does an English paper for him.  The fact that they spend a lot of time together is soon noticed by their classmates, who begin to torment them both - Danny physically - about being homosexual.This is a very well-produced and directed film, with excellent acting, including small roles by Greg Louganis (as Carter's swim coach) and Karen Black (as Danny's art teacher).  Also noteworthy are the two newcomers who play the teens, Tye Olson (as Danny) and  Kyle Clare (as Carter, who looks like a young Sean Penn).  The only negatives are some problems with sound on exterior location shots, and dialogue that sometimes veers into trite ""movie of the week"" clich&eacute;s.

1332478,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0038M61J6,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 1]","A gay film about a couple of young teenagers in high school in Los Angeles or around, who are looking for their path out of the nowhere of their present, find it and then lose it and find it again but this time the paths are branching out, one low and one high. What is so special about this one that we can&#8217;t find in any other?The two young men are just so different that they should never have met and yet destiny and fate are the only trolls and gnomes who decide for us ,and in this case they bring together a brilliant student who is planning to major in art and a mediocre student who is on the swim team and needs to improve his grades in English and asks the brilliant future artist to help him with Romeo and Juliet. Fate I said.What was to happen happens of course between the art student who knows he is gay but is just waiting for an opportunity to make him come out and the swimmer who does not know he is gay but is able to fool about with the idea in private but not in public. And fate works a tragedy out of it. The art student writes the swimmer&#8217;s paper on Romeo and Julier but he does not know what style is and his paper is not fake enough to go through and becomes suspicious to the English teacher who has forgotten how he went through college and university.Sure enough the swimmer&#8217;s father is not very swift either and he reveals to his son his mother has been arrested and he has bailed her out in the distant Texas where she is living after her separation from her husband and where the swimmer wants to go to for college. The swimmer finishes only second in the competition that takes place on the following day of this bad news, of this second bad news. What&#8217;s left then? Nothing and the artist is not strong enough to convince him that life is worth living even if swimming is his only horizon because he has just been kicked out of the swim team.The end is tragic of course and the film is clear that the two young men are confronted to such a heavy pressure in their families, at school, from the administration, from the bullies, from their parents, from the teachers and the school&#8217;s principal dares to announce the bad news on the intercom at the beginning of the classes. Communication is not exactly the strong point of school officials.A jump a few years forward and the artist-to-be is an artist now, a successful one who has finally found the power of a style, of his style in his suffering, and some solace in a lover he does not seem to really see, at least not on his canvass, and the lover is hurt and suffers to only be second, though he is the real live one.The end is touching in delicate watercolors if you want, but does it bring closure to the suffering of a death caused by all kinds of bullying elements in this life that becomes lethal on blinded purpose, with the only aim of making people who are too innocent not too hide their feelings suffer as much as possible because it is funny to see a living being suffering, and if it is to death it is even more attractive. Gladiators are no longer in  circuses but gladiator-games take place in our everyday environment: in the street, in the subway, at school, and in all places where it is funny for a bully to torture his or her victim, in fact where he or she can find an audience.This film is nearly refreshing in its sadness, even if I doubt a swimmer could be accepted on a swim team with shoulder long hair.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Sadly beautiful,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,3465,"['gay', 'film', 'couple', 'young', 'teenagers', 'high', 'school', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'around', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'path', 'nowhere', 'present', 'find', 'then', 'lose', 'find', 'again', 'time', 'paths', 'are', 'branching', 'out', 'one', 'low', 'one', 'high', 'What', 'so', 'special', 'one', 'can', '8217', 't', 'find', 'other', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'different', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'met', 'yet', 'destiny', 'fate', 'are', 'only', 'trolls', 'gnomes', 'who', 'decide', 'case', 'bring', 'together', 'brilliant', 'student', 'who', 'planning', 'major', 'art', 'mediocre', 'student', 'who', 'swim', 'team', 'improve', 'grades', 'English', 'brilliant', 'future', 'artist', 'help', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Fate', 'said.What', 'was', 'happen', 'happens', 'course', 'art', 'student', 'who', 'gay', 'just', 'waiting', 'opportunity', 'make', 'come', 'out', 'swimmer', 'who', 'not', 'know', 'gay', 'able', 'fool', 'idea', 'private', 'not', 'public', 'fate', 'tragedy', 'art', 'student', 'swimmer', '8217', 's', 'paper', 'Romeo', 'Julier', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'style', 'paper', 'not', 'fake', 'enough', 'go', 'suspicious', 'English', 'teacher', 'who', 'forgotten', 'how', 'went', 'college', 'university.Sure', 'enough', 'swimmer', '8217', 'father', 'not', 'very', 'swift', 'son', 'mother', 'been', 'arrested', 'bailed', 'out', 'distant', 'Texas', 'where', 'living', 'separation', 'husband', 'where', 'swimmer', 'go', 'college', 'swimmer', 'only', 'second', 'competition', 'place', 'following', 'day', 'bad', 'news', 'second', 'bad', 'news', 'What', '8217', 'left', 'then', 'Nothing', 'artist', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'convince', 'life', 'living', 'even', 'swimming', 'only', 'horizon', 'just', 'been', 'kicked', 'swim', 'team.The', 'end', 'tragic', 'course', 'film', 'clear', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'are', 'confronted', 'such', 'heavy', 'pressure', 'families', 'school', 'administration', 'bullies', 'parents', 'teachers', 'school', '8217', 'principal', 'dares', 'announce', 'bad', 'news', 'intercom', 'beginning', 'classes', 'Communication', 'not', 'exactly', 'strong', 'point', 'school', 'officials.A', 'jump', 'few', 'years', 'forward', 'artist-to-be', 'artist', 'now', 'successful', 'one', 'who', 'finally', 'found', 'power', 'style', 'style', 'suffering', 'solace', 'lover', 'not', 'seem', 'really', 'see', 'least', 'not', 'canvass', 'lover', 'hurt', 'suffers', 'only', 'be', 'second', 'real', 'live', 'one.The', 'end', 'touching', 'delicate', 'watercolors', 'want', 'bring', 'closure', 'suffering', 'death', 'caused', 'kinds', 'bullying', 'elements', 'life', 'lethal', 'blinded', 'purpose', 'only', 'aim', 'making', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'innocent', 'not', 'too', 'hide', 'feelings', 'suffer', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'funny', 'see', 'living', 'being', 'suffering', 'death', 'even', 'more', 'attractive', 'Gladiators', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'circuses', 'gladiator-games', 'take', 'place', 'everyday', 'environment', 'street', 'subway', 'school', 'places', 'where', 'funny', 'bully', 'torture', 'victim', 'fact', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'audience.This', 'film', 'nearly', 'refreshing', 'sadness', 'even', 'doubt', 'swimmer', 'could', 'be', 'accepted', 'swim', 'team', 'shoulder', 'long', 'hair.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A
1332479,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B0038M61J6,J. Martin,"[7, 7]","For about the first twenty minutes I thought I was going to hate this movie, but it got better. Then it got better. Then it got even better, and it just kept on getting better all the way through to the end.I strongly disagree with reviewers who say the adult bookends are irrelevant and badly done. They provide an essential framework for the story. The adult actors are neither as attractive nor as talented as the younger leads are, but that's fine; they don't need to be.My only quibble - and it is a very minor quibble - is that the character of Henry is just too evil within the context of this movie. I know people like that exist, people who are so mean and so stupid that they would keep on smirking when the hero is having convulsions, but no other character in this movie is drawn with such unrelenting severity. He is so evil he ends up dragging the whole movie down in a way it doesn't need to be dragged down. I suppose his being so excessively monstrous adds extra weight to Danny's accusation that Carter hurt him even more than Henry did, but that accusation didn't need such heavy-handed reinforcement; it was powerful enough in itself.The direction, photography and screenplay could not be much better - an impressive debut for David Oliveras.

I bought this move with that intention. Unfortunately, since our group starts @13, I can't really show all of it without blocking the sexual content. The sexual stuff it beautifully done though, very much like Renaissance artwork to be exact. I think that was probably intentional so that the film could have a wider audience. I've probably viewed over 300 queer related films, both domestic & foreign. Although many of them are quite good, I can usually tell the actors are doing what they are paid to do: act. This is the best job (in a 'coming of age' story) of two boys in love that I've ever seen. You really do believe that they are in love, but diametrically opposed in personalities. Opposites attract for sure, but then how do you sort things out for a long term relationship?! Often you don't, that's why 'coming of age' stories are so poignant. Especially since I was in the same situation as the one character; deeply in love with a free spirit who just wasn't mature enough yet to commit in true gay love.

While the artist figured himself out, the swimmer is deeply struggling with the expectations of his surroundings. Both parts are pretty realistically portrait-ed by the great young actors. A couple very nice scenes - mostly involving the ""artist"".Two older female actors (mom and art teacher) were a bit off at the begin of the movie. (Their acting just didn't fit the casual style of the movie at the begin.)I totally clinched over the announcement scene - that was totally off and unrealistic. This scene would have been 1000 times stronger if either the literature teacher or Greg L would have done that part.I don't think the movie got any post-production / sound-fixing done - so, whenever the swimmer skates, the conversations are almost lost in the typical board rattling noise.All in all a great script turned into an ""okay"" movie, which had the potential to be something really amazing by better direction and post-production.",4,It's okay ...,1287014400,"10 14, 2010",2010,1038,"['basically', 'life', 'two', 'gay', 'teenage', 'boys', 'high', 'school', 'upcoming', 'artist', 'swimmer', 'artist', 'figured', 'out', 'swimmer', 'deeply', 'struggling', 'expectations', 'surroundings', 'parts', 'are', 'pretty', 'realistically', 'portrait-ed', 'great', 'young', 'actors', 'couple', 'very', 'nice', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'involving', 'artist', '.Two', 'older', 'female', 'actors', 'mom', 'art', 'teacher', 'were', 'bit', 'off', 'begin', 'movie', 'acting', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'casual', 'style', 'movie', 'begin', 'totally', 'clinched', 'announcement', 'scene', 'was', 'totally', 'off', 'unrealistic', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'been', '1000', 'times', 'stronger', 'literature', 'teacher', 'Greg', 'L', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'part.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'got', 'post-production', '/', 'sound-fixing', 'done', 'so', 'whenever', 'swimmer', 'skates', 'conversations', 'are', 'almost', 'lost', 'typical', 'board', 'rattling', 'noise.All', 'great', 'script', 'turned', 'okay', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'something', 'really', 'amazing', 'better', 'direction', 'post-production']",N/A
