We watched every episode from the first to the last as they first aired.  Fun, exciting, entertaining, serious and silly. Like Loony Tunes it was dual purpose: the adults get as much out of it as the kids do. It was a great way to introduce DC's &#34;New Titans&#34; to new generations of kids who weren't there when those classic comics were coming out.",5,Bonding,1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,430,"['show', 'became', 'bonding', 'element', 'daughter', 'watched', 'episode', 'first', 'last', 'first', 'aired', 'Fun', 'exciting', 'entertaining', 'serious', 'silly', 'Loony', 'Tunes', 'was', 'dual', 'purpose', 'adults', 'get', 'as', 'much', 'kids', 'do', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'introduce', 'DC', '34', 'New', 'Titans', '34', 'new', 'generations', 'kids', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'when', 'classic', 'comics', 'were', 'coming', 'out']",Teen Titans Complete Season :1-5 5pk

1234491,A12IL8I5VWM3HN,B001RXB4K4,L.D.,"[0, 0]",I started watching this show in 2003 at the age of 12 when this aired along with my 7 year old sister. Ten years later and now ages 22 and 17 we have recently rediscovered this on Boomerang (making us feel a little old after remembering these episodes airing originally). We love this show and we have seen the new short animated series and have had a few chuckles with it. It is nice to have all the episodes on DVD and not have to stay up late on Mon-Fri. The only minor quibble is the day I went to go buy the complete series (for my sister's birthday) all together the price was raised at least $10 from what it was when I checked it two days before. I decided to buy the seasons individually and in the process this saved me some money. I advise all who think of buying the complete series to double/triple check as I did.,5,Big fan of the show.,1381968000,"10 17, 2013",2013,827,"['started', 'watching', 'show', '2003', 'age', '12', 'when', 'aired', '7', 'year', 'old', 'sister', 'Ten', 'years', 'later', 'now', '22', '17', 'have', 'recently', 'rediscovered', 'Boomerang', 'making', 'feel', 'little', 'old', 'remembering', 'episodes', 'airing', 'originally', 'love', 'show', 'have', 'seen', 'new', 'short', 'animated', 'series', 'have', 'had', 'few', 'chuckles', 'nice', 'have', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'not', 'have', 'stay', 'up', 'late', 'Mon-Fri', 'only', 'minor', 'quibble', 'day', 'went', 'go', 'buy', 'complete', 'series', 'sister', 'birthday', 'together', 'price', 'was', 'raised', 'least', '10', 'what', 'was', 'when', 'checked', 'two', 'days', 'decided', 'buy', 'seasons', 'individually', 'process', 'saved', 'money', 'advise', 'who', 'think', 'buying', 'complete', 'series', 'double/triple', 'check', 'did']",Teen Titans Complete Season :1-5 5pk

I couldn't believe how much story and development could be shown! The theme song is wonderful! It's right up there with the Spongebob theme as the greatest TV show theme song ever! I love the drama of this show and the balanced mixture of comedy. Neither of them are overdone! What I really love about this show too is Beast Boy. He's just a great comic relief, not to mention he has all three of my favorite colors on him-black, purple, and green. The other titans are great too; Starfire's pleasantly naive but fierce in battle, Raven is gloomy but sarcastic, Cyborg's booyas and huge appetite are great, the comedy list goes on. I like how the episodes vary from funny like ""Bunny Raven"" or dark the Season 4 story arc episodes ""Birthmark"", ""The Prophecy"", and ""The End, Parts 1-3"". I just adore it!
