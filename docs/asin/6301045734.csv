The choice  of actors is quite good, and I am thankful that the complete plot was  preserved, rather than attempting to alter it in favor of a more active  storyline.

It's as if Newman had decided that this classic Tennessee Williams play, with its searing emotional conflicts that constantly ebb and flow, was too familiar now - so something else was attempted. The emotions seem filtered out, purculated down to work against something deeper in us.In most productions of this play, when the emotions have played out before us we watch and react with the actors; here we are expected to THINK about what the actors are SUPPOSED to be emoting. We are forced to see this movie from a distance, across an intellecualized gap: it's movie making as an intellectual exercise rather than an emotional one - almost a misuse of the medium. Joanne Woodward plays the mother; Karen Allen is the shy, lame daughter; and John Malkovitch is the son. All the actors perform admirably, but the results are too restrained and safe, not bold and daring.",4,A guarded and bridled Menagerie,1134086400,"12 9, 2005",2005,951,"['production', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'good', 'one', 'lacking', 'power', 'Newman', 'had', 'decided', 'classic', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'play', 'searing', 'emotional', 'conflicts', 'constantly', 'flow', 'was', 'too', 'familiar', 'now', 'so', 'something', 'else', 'was', 'attempted', 'emotions', 'seem', 'filtered', 'out', 'purculated', 'down', 'work', 'something', 'deeper', 'us.In', 'most', 'productions', 'play', 'when', 'emotions', 'have', 'played', 'out', 'watch', 'react', 'actors', 'here', 'are', 'expected', 'THINK', 'what', 'actors', 'are', 'SUPPOSED', 'be', 'emoting', 'are', 'forced', 'see', 'movie', 'distance', 'intellecualized', 'gap', 'movie', 'making', 'intellectual', 'exercise', 'rather', 'emotional', 'one', 'almost', 'misuse', 'medium', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'mother', 'Karen', 'Allen', 'shy', 'lame', 'daughter', 'John', 'Malkovitch', 'son', 'actors', 'perform', 'admirably', 'results', 'are', 'too', 'restrained', 'safe', 'not', 'bold', 'daring']",The Glass Menagerie 1987  VHS

243943,A3410YP65KJQ3M,6301045734,"Mark ""mdippy""","[0, 0]","Out of all three film versions of this play, I would have to say this version is the best of them. Unlike the 1950's version, we the viewers never really leave the apartment building. We never get to see Laura failing in typing class, or her father riding out on a ship somewhere or her mother in her glory days in a grand ballroom. No, despite this fact the movie still manages to hold our attention for over 2 hours, all events being set in one space and time. John Malkovich gives one of his finest performances. Throughout the film you can literally feel his angst. Joanna Woodward is almost over the top as the ever intrusive and overbearing mother (or should I say martyr?) I think this is due to that nagging tone of voice she musters up for her part. Her portrayal of this character is very different than Katherine Hepburn's fine performance in the 1973 version. Karen Allen plays her part equally as well as the timid and shy Laura. She really is a fine and underated actress. I have viewed this movie at least 10 times in the last ten years and it always seems fresh to me. You can attribute some of the reasons for this to the movies fine director, Paul Newman as well as a wonderful cast ensemble.",5,The Best Version There Is By A Nose,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,1210,"['three', 'film', 'versions', 'play', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'version', 'best', '1950', 'version', 'viewers', 'never', 'really', 'leave', 'apartment', 'building', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'Laura', 'failing', 'typing', 'class', 'father', 'riding', 'out', 'ship', 'somewhere', 'mother', 'glory', 'days', 'grand', 'ballroom', 'No', 'fact', 'movie', 'still', 'hold', 'attention', '2', 'hours', 'events', 'being', 'set', 'one', 'space', 'time', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'film', 'can', 'literally', 'feel', 'angst', 'Joanna', 'Woodward', 'almost', 'top', 'ever', 'intrusive', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'should', 'say', 'martyr', 'think', 'due', 'nagging', 'tone', 'voice', 'up', 'part', 'portrayal', 'character', 'very', 'different', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'fine', 'performance', '1973', 'version', 'Karen', 'Allen', 'part', 'equally', 'as', 'well', 'timid', 'shy', 'Laura', 'really', 'fine', 'underated', 'actress', 'have', 'viewed', 'movie', 'least', '10', 'times', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'always', 'fresh', 'can', 'attribute', 'reasons', 'movies', 'fine', 'director', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'as', 'well', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'ensemble']",The Glass Menagerie 1987  VHS
243944,A39U46YVMAEKKC,6301045734,Pintorini,"[17, 17]","Of the numerous interpretations of this play that I've seen on stage and screen, this is the best--a strong statement considering the many excellent actors who've been attracted to Tennessee Williams's powerful characters (e.g. Katherine Hepburn and Sam Waterston).  John Malkovich seems to have been born to play Tom, the artist torn between familial duties and wanderlust.  Malkovich's intense and percussive style is an ideal match for Williams's play, in which the text and its poetry dominate.  His performance in this role is the most convincing of any I've seen, and avoids the pitfall of allowing Tom to become too morose and self-absorbed.  Joanne Woodward is also perfect as Amanda, who, though deluded, narrow, and even stupid, holds her family together through her unique mixture of courage and desperation.  Karen Allen and James Naughton also capture what I think Williams must have intended in the characters Laura Wingfield and the gentlemen caller, and the two generate real chemistry in the pivotal scene with the glass unicorn.

243945,AXHCIHVT92GYF,6301045734,The CinemaScope Cat,"[0, 0]","A young loner (John Malkovich) recalls his dysfunctional home life with his faded Southern belle mother (Joanne Woodward) and his awkward and shy sister (Karen Allen). Specifically, the night he brought home a ""gentleman caller"" (James Naughton, THE PAPER CHASE) for his sister, a friend from work to dinner at the insistence of his mother. I'm not sure that Tennessee Williams' ethereal and lyrical memory piece can or will ever successfully be translated into film. Any attempt to cinematize it would most likely destroy the delicacy of the play. It's a self described memory piece, fragile and poignant. The camera's harsh glare seems to be almost invasive. The character of Amanda Wingfield, the former Southern belle who clings to her Magnolia dripped past, is a dicey character to play. In some ways, she's a beautiful monster but the actress playing her needs to balance the nagging shrew with the loving mother who wants the best for her children. It's a tightrope act alright. Woodward's performance may be erratic but she's still better than the previous screen Amandas, Gertrude Lawrence and Kate Hepburn. Amanda may be the most memorable character but the highlight of the film is the lengthy, beautifully played out scene between Laura (Allen) and her gentleman caller (Naughton). Of the actors, it's John Malkovich who nails it though. His ""selfish dreamer"" (based on Williams' himself) is underplayed to perfection and he gets every nuance out of Williams' stunning poetry. Directed by Paul Newman with a fine bluesy score by Henry Mancini.The Dutch DVD is an adequate transfer which is full frame rather than in its original theatrical aspect ratio (1.85).",4,Not perfect ... but still the best filmed version of Tennessee Williams' memory piece,1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,1672,"['young', 'loner', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'dysfunctional', 'home', 'life', 'faded', 'Southern', 'belle', 'mother', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'awkward', 'shy', 'sister', 'Karen', 'Allen', 'Specifically', 'night', 'brought', 'home', 'gentleman', 'caller', 'James', 'Naughton', 'THE', 'PAPER', 'CHASE', 'sister', 'friend', 'work', 'dinner', 'insistence', 'mother', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'ethereal', 'lyrical', 'memory', 'piece', 'can', 'will', 'ever', 'successfully', 'be', 'translated', 'film', 'attempt', 'cinematize', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'destroy', 'delicacy', 'play', 'self', 'described', 'memory', 'piece', 'fragile', 'poignant', 'camera', 'harsh', 'glare', 'be', 'almost', 'invasive', 'character', 'Amanda', 'Wingfield', 'former', 'Southern', 'belle', 'who', 'Magnolia', 'dripped', 'past', 'dicey', 'character', 'play', 'ways', 'beautiful', 'monster', 'actress', 'playing', 'needs', 'balance', 'nagging', 'shrew', 'loving', 'mother', 'who', 'best', 'children', 'tightrope', 'act', 'alright', 'Woodward', 'performance', 'may', 'be', 'erratic', 'still', 'better', 'previous', 'screen', 'Amandas', 'Gertrude', 'Lawrence', 'Kate', 'Hepburn', 'Amanda', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'memorable', 'character', 'highlight', 'film', 'lengthy', 'beautifully', 'played', 'out', 'scene', 'Laura', 'Allen', 'gentleman', 'caller', 'Naughton', 'actors', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'who', 'selfish', 'dreamer', 'based', 'Williams', 'underplayed', 'perfection', 'nuance', 'Williams', 'stunning', 'poetry', 'Directed', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'fine', 'bluesy', 'score', 'Henry', 'Mancini.The', 'Dutch', 'DVD', 'adequate', 'transfer', 'full', 'frame', 'rather', 'original', 'theatrical', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.85']",The Glass Menagerie 1987  VHS
