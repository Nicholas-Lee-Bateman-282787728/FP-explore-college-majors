1337469,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003DT193W,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[19, 19]","""Max and Ruby"" is an enjoyable, fun, animated children's series that can easily be appreciated by young and old.  I mean this is in true sincerity as I have had the opportunity to watch this series when my son was 1-years-old and then most recently as my son was hooked on the series once again at age 7.The children's animated series was created by author/illustrator Rosemary Wells who based the series on her two daughters and the experiences they had with friends and in school.  The series debuted in 2002 (the pilot was shown on TV back in 2001 on Noggin) and continues to air with a total of four seasons being shown on Nick Jr. and Nickelodeon.""Max and Ruby"" revolves around seven-year-old Ruby and her younger three year-old brother Max.  Typically, the stories revolve around Ruby working on a project and Max somehow trying to get her attention (or cause a disturbance) and easily distracting her.  But somehow, whenever Ruby gets into a jam, her younger brother ends up helping her out in some form.In each episode of ""Max & Ruby"" are three mini-episodes.  In ""Max & Ruby: A Visit with Grandma"", a total of four episodes (12 mini-episodes total) revolves around Max, Ruby & their grandmother.The episodes featured on this DVD are:* Grandma's Treasure Hunt, Ruby's Jigsaw Puzzle and Ruby's Recital - In this episode, Ruby and her friend Louise try to fight Grandma's treasure with the help of Pirate Max.  In the second episode, Ruby works on a new puzzle and knowing that if she is missing a piece, she can't complete the puzzle but maybe Max can help her find it.  In the third episode, Grandma is coming over for a recital but will she find an instrument to play?* Ruby's Rainbow, Home Tweet Home, Max's Mudpie - Max wants to play outside but Ruby wants to make rainbow paintings for her grandmother.  In the second episode, Ruby and Louise are working on a birdhouse but her hungry brother Max tends to keep bothering her.  The third's episode features Max wanting to make a mudpie for Grandma.* Ruby's Home Run, Ruby's missing Tune, Ruby's Hand Stand - Ruby wants to play baseball but Max's toys are in the way.  Ruby plans to do a ballet for Grandma but she forgets the music (which Max can easily remember).  In the third mini-episode, Ruby practices gymnastics but Max keeps bothering her and wants to play in the swing instead.* Ruby's Good Neighbor Report, Candy Counting, Ruby's New Shoes - Grandma, Ruby and Max look for ""the best neighbor"".  The second episode features Ruby expecting Max to help her in a candy counting contest.  The third episode features Max wanting to see Super Bunny but he has to go shoe shopping with Grandma and Ruby instead.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Max & Ruby"" is featured in full screen and for the most part, vibrant, colorful and well-animated.  The backgrounds feature artistic/oil painted backgrounds with plenty of detail while Max & Ruby and friends are animated.  Although the characters are not shaded, the detailed background compliments the character animation.Audio is presented in Dolby Digital (English Stereo).  The series is front channel driven and testing this DVD on a receiver, regular TV and on computer, the dialogue is clear and understandable.As for subtitles, there are no subtitles but the series does feature closed-captions.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Max & Ruby: A Visit with Grandma"" does not come with any special features.JUDGMENT CALL:If there was one children's show that I literally watched my son grow up to, it would be ""Max & Ruby"".  Nickelodeon (and Noggin) had various shows for children in the early-2000's from ""Dora the Explorer"" and ""Blue's Clues"" but there was something about ""Max & Ruby"" that captured my son's attention and even seven years later, upon reviewing the DVD ""Max & Ruby: A Visit with Grandma"", although he doesn't watch the children's shows these days, he was hooked on watching this animated series once again.And it's probably one of the few series that I don't mind watching with him over and over.  Granted, it's because I can easily remember him loving this show on television when he was much younger but it's a series that he can learn about teamwork and also brother/sister relations, decision-making and more.It's important to note that the series is not educational in the sense when compared to ""Blue's Clues"", ""Go Diego Go!"", ""Dora the Explorer"" or ""Yo Gabba Gabba!"".  There is no host and the characters do not speak to the audience.  It's typically a cartoon that has a storyline and it helps that these episodes are short, easy to follow and for the most part, are safe and enjoyable.As for the DVD, you do get four episodes (12 mini-episodes total) but I am surprised that this is another Nickelodeon DVD with no special features.  There are games, printables, activities and more on [...] but it would be nice if Nickelodeon can include some of these features ala DVD-Rom.But overall, ""Max & Ruby: A Visit with Grandma"" is a enjoyable DVD for the children.  Plenty of good episodes featuring Max, Ruby and also Grandma.  If you are a parent looking for a perfect children's DVD for Summer vacation, for a long commute to keep them busy in the car or just a safe, children's series, look no further, ""Max & Ruby"" is definitely recommended!",5,"An enjoyable children's animated series that is safe, fun, educational and absolutely recommended for your child!",1276560000,"06 15, 2010",2010,5246,"['Max', 'Ruby',
