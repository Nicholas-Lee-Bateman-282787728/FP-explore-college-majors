Once I got my package and opened it up I was pretty disappointed.The 45 record sleeves that held the discs were very poorly glued together. One was completely open as it had not been glued properly at all!The quality of the prints are very poor-there's lots of dirt on them in every episode. I was surprised at what a poor &quot;remastering&quot; job they had done on the prints. Many of the tunes (especially &quot;Goin' Down&quot;) sound very muffled, no matter whether you set the audio at 2.0 or 5.1!I like these episodes immensely but I can't help but express my disappointment at the poor quality of it all.",3,A Rhino Rush Job???,1069372800,"11 21, 2003",2003,724,"['was', 'pretty', 'stoked', 'hear', 'Rhino', 'was', 'finally', 'going', 'release', 'second', 'season', 'Monkees', 'TV', 'show', 'Once', 'got', 'package', 'opened', 'up', 'was', 'pretty', 'disappointed.The', '45', 'record', 'sleeves', 'held', 'discs', 'were', 'very', 'poorly', 'glued', 'together', 'One', 'was', 'completely', 'open', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'glued', 'properly', 'quality', 'prints', 'are', 'very', 'poor-there', 'lots', 'dirt', 'episode', 'was', 'surprised', 'what', 'poor', 'quot', 'remastering', 'quot', 'job', 'had', 'done', 'prints', 'Many', 'tunes', 'especially', 'quot', 'Goin', 'Down', 'quot', 'sound', 'very', 'muffled', 'matter', 'set', 'audio', '2.0', '5.1', 'episodes', 'immensely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'express', 'disappointment', 'poor', 'quality']",The Monkees: Season 2

Then the price shot up ridiculously so I waited, and waited and waited. Finally, vindication!What a fun show. The songs, the color, the psychedelic  shift of the band. It captures a time and a place that will never come to pass -- Southern California during the summer of love ('66-'67).  Sure it was silly but they were so cute and so much fun to watch. Good clean fun. By the way, Mike Nesmith is an incredible song writer (check out his earliest ballads on youtube). I still love his music. And the Monkees and their songs are still a pleasure to hear. These early music videos still make my heart skip a beat, just like when I was a kid. That's a really nice feeling.Whoever made this happen, thank you. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE THE MONKEES.

I actually enjoy the second season episodes to the first, but I was disappointed at the sound quality of the music. Rhino owns the original master to the Monkees recordings, and could easily have improved on the sound over the original 16mm prints, but unfortunately didn't. The music clips on most episodes sound muffled and distorted.  This is especially true for the &quot;Rainbow&quot; performances, the end-of-show music videos that feature the Monkees lip syncing to their songs. I didn't notice this on the audio of the first season shows. How hard would it have been to overdub the stereo recordings to these clips? On the plus side, the picture quality was generally excellent, and the inclusion of the rare 33 &amp; 1/3 special (with very good audio) makes this worth recommending.  However,  I was still disappointed at this set from Rhino, a label with a usually excellent track record",3,"Great shows, but sound quality not so great...",1089590400,"07 12, 2004",2004,1033,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'set', 'while', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'just', 'recently', 'was', 'working', 'way', 'first', 'season', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'second', 'season', 'episodes', 'first', 'was', 'disappointed', 'sound', 'quality', 'music', 'Rhino', 'original', 'master', 'Monkees', 'recordings', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'improved', 'sound', 'original', '16mm', 'prints', 'unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'music', 'clips', 'most', 'episodes', 'sound', 'muffled', 'distorted', 'especially', 'true', 'quot', 'Rainbow', 'quot', 'performances', 'end-of-show', 'music', 'videos', 'feature', 'Monkees', 'lip', 'syncing', 'songs', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'audio', 'first', 'season', 'shows', 'How', 'hard', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'overdub', 'stereo', 'recordings', 'clips', 'plus', 'side', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'generally', 'excellent', 'inclusion', 'rare', '33', 'amp', '1/3', 'special', 'very', 'good', 'audio', 'worth', 'recommending', 'However', 'was', 'still', 'disappointed', 'set', 'Rhino', 'label', 'usually', 'excellent', 'track', 'record']",The Monkees: Season 2

While the package was pretty badly damaged, and the plastic cases fell out of the holder as soon as I opened it, the DVDs were in remarkable condition.  These episodes bring back such happy memories and I was able to see some episodes from Season 2 that I don't recall seeing when I was a kid.  Unlike some reviewers, I've played four of the disc and not had any problems with video or audio.  Yes, I suppose the film could have been remastered, but I'm not high tech in either my audio or visual needs, and so the fact that there is no hissing or popping on my DVDs is good enough for me.

782742,A1615O1J763JD2,B0000TAZW4,Kevin Stafford,"[6, 10]","I have awaited this second season set (as the first season) for years. The quality of the prints are great with the well known exception of &quot;Monkees In Paris&quot; which was supposedly filmed in 16mm. The commentary is nice with the exception of Micky's contributions. It seems he does a lot of tearing apart, even the episode he directed &quot;The Frodis Caper&quot;! His commentary to &quot;33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee&quot; (here in the correct running order unlike the way it was originally broadcast) is so trashing I wonder why RHINO even let it remain. I know good and well the special does take some getting used to for the non-Monkees fan, but for it's day, in my opinion, was a break-through in television. Brian Auger's commentary is great! I was quite surprised he remembered so much!Now, like the title of my review, I feel there could have been more added. The bonus footage from &quot;The Glen Campbell Show&quot; shows the 2 more obscure comedy clips from that show but doesn't include their &quot;live&quot; medley, The &quot;Tear Drop City&quot; lip-sync &quot;video&quot; or the fabulous history musical skit. I wonder why they didn't press to get the Kool- Aid Commercials on this set also.Seeing in most cases, this set is a bit more expensive, with less episodes, I feel there could have been a bit more. Funny that Michael even mentions their reunion episode but wouldn't let Rhino include it. That would have made it come full circle.I have rated it 5 stars on the content and it's quality. If I was rating on how much effort was put into this project compared to the 1st season box set, I guess I would take a star away. The Packaging is as great as the 1st season with the psuedo 45 picture sleeves! I know most complain that the discs slide out but I never had that problem with the 1st box set.Being a fan of &quot;Star Trek&quot; as well, I wished Paramont would put those episodes out in a set because at the average $17.99 per disc with 79 episodes plus the unaired pilot and 2 on each of all 40 disc's, it's roughly $720.00 minus local tax. That's neither hear nor there but I guess it does illustrate the great value of both of these sets!Cheers to RHINO at keeping the costs at a minimum!

782743,A3G2DMLKUDFO5Q,B0000TAZW4,landru141,"[5, 5]","Of course, it's the Monkees second season ... and we are well and truly crossing into strange places.Strange as it might seem to modern audiences, this band was created by Hollywood, their music chosen and played by others and they acted and sang the songs.  Pretty much how most popular music is made today (think of almost any recording artist, making videos and doing concerts ... they have a serious team of people pre-packaging them.) However, the Monkees were created at a time when that was very uncool.  During the first year, as they worked almost constantly on their series and singing, they also started jaming and by the end of the season, recording their 3rd album entirely on their own (with Chip Douglas as producer and bass player.)  That album ""Headquarters"" was the second biggest album of the ""Summer of Love"" - The Beatles ""Sgt. Pepper's"" was the biggest.  They toured, Mickey and Peter showed up at Monteray Pop Festival, hung out with all the coolest musicians, Hendrix opened for them breifly ... and returned for season 2.This season starts out with what looks to be some left overs from season 1 and things are fairly normal ... but suddenly, Mickey has a perm, Mike is wearing dark shades, and the music is getting pretty far out.  A song of Peter's, the Love In ode ""For Pete's Sake"" becomes the closing theme, Mike is writing in a variety of modes, including the L.A. riot inspired ""Daily Nightly"" and even Davey seems to have turned a bit seedy with songs like ""Star Collector"" (an ode to groupies.)  These Monkees have grown up and taken over.  The last episode is directed by Micky himself and looks as if they were trying a new direction.  But, the show was cancelled.  If you can, try and watch their swansong film ""Head"" (preferably the Criterion edition) before you take a look at the ""33 1/3"" special contained on the last disc.The discs themselves are the same as the previous box sets, just a LOT cheaper and easier to put on a shelf.  I'm not crazy about the fake 5.1 mix.  However, the mono is perfectly clean and the image is quite sharp.

782746,A3Q83VI243WI7U,B0000TAZW4,Michael Topper,"[8, 8]","The second season box set is much like the first, in that it is overpriced, with suprisingly poor sound (the 5.1 selection is best but even that is not anywhere near what it should be), but otherwise a great compilation of all the episodes.  Some fans prefer the tighter first season, and some the looser second year.  I go for the second season, primarily because the songs are superior (with nearly all stemming from their two finest works &quot;Headquarters&quot; and &quot;Pisces, Aquarious...&quot;--just imagine what those teenyboppers back in late '67 must've thought when they heard &quot;Star Collector&quot; for the first time!), and I do enjoy the greater spontaneity and half-improvised nature of the scripts.  The group look like they are having fun, goofing around on set and filming cool tags for the end of each show that parody normal television formulas.  The jokes are more sophisticated, culminating in thedelightful &quot;Frodis Caper&quot;, directed by Dolenz and quite possibly the first sitcom episode to feature drug humor.  There are also cool guest spots by Zappa, Tim Buckley and Charlie Smalls, a stunning a capella rendition of &quot;Riu Chiu&quot; for the Christmas episode, and the increased color and intensity of the psychedelic era in general.  Note also the transitional nature of the earliest episodes filmed in the spring of '67 (which you can tell because Mickey's hair is still straight in them): some of the tightness of the first season remains (along with the use of several rejected first season scripts), but the wilder fashions and more risque humor of the latter half of the season also begins to creep in; it is this perfect combination of tight and loose which makes that period my favorite of the show.The best episodes include the aforementioned &quot;Frodis Caper&quot;, the touching &quot;Devil And Peter Tork&quot;, the truly bizarre &quot;Monkees Watch Their Feet&quot; (with Pat Paulsen in fine form and Dolenz an absolute riot as a robot) and &quot;The Monkees' Paw&quot; (Dolenz in dazzling comic form once again).  The band were even allowed to parody their own frustration with the increasingly formulaic nature of the scripts in &quot;The Monkees In Paris&quot;--which only proved that they weren't so formulaic, although Davy Jones still falls in love every other episode.  The commentaries are generally pretty good, and Mickey is a scream reminiscing about &quot;The Frodis Caper&quot;.Finally, the extras are nice, including some TV appearances and news footage, as well as the vastly underrated and overlooked special &quot;33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee&quot;.  While &quot;33 1/3&quot; has a thin plot and some filler--including their worst filmed moment as singing chimps--it also contains some of their best-ever performances and *spectacular* guest stars, including Julie Driscoll (a superb singer) and her partner Brian Auger (a brilliant Keith Emerson-like organist), plus the three piano giants from the 50s: Little Richard, Fats Domino and Jerry Lee Lewis.  Add The Buddy Miles Express, and the complaint that The Monkees were second-billed in their own special becomes moot--with guest stars like these, who cares?  The band itself are still good, and the closing performance of &quot;Listen To The Band&quot; has to be seen to be believed--their mind-blowing final live appearance (before the 80s/90s reunion tours) being the total avant-garde antithesis of their commercial bubblegum image.

782747,A1YIGQWYB2WN4R,B0000TAZW4,"Michelle S. ""Michelle""","[165, 180]","First of all, let me state that this review does not concern itself with the content of the Monkees episodes.  I grew up with the show in 1970's syndication and love it.  I'm a big fan of both the show and the Monkees' music.The axe I have to grind is not with the show, the music, or the (1960's) Monkees themselves.  Those aspects of the show get a 5-star rating from me.  (And if you are reading this, then I assume you are also a big fan.)  It's just that while Apple was able to wonderfully restore the Beatles' legacy in the &quot;Anthology&quot; DVD collection, Rhino chose not to do the same thing here...My first problem is the fact that Rhino (or more precisely, AOL Time Warner, which bought Rhino in 1998) did not bother to spend any money to restore &amp; clean up the audio or video of any of these episodes.  If you bought the mid-90's VHS box set and were expecting an audio &amp; video upgrade, you're going to be in for a disappointment.  Rhino seems to have used the same video masters they used for the earlier collection (the 1994, 1995, &amp; 1996 ""program content"" copyrights on the DVD boxes would support this theory).The audio portions of each episode sound much softer than the title screens.  As a result, you have to crank the volume up when you watch an episode.  When the episode is finished, and you go back to the title screen (and forget to reset the volume), it's almost like being hit on the head when you are blasted by the *very* loud Monkee's Theme that will greet you there.  Granted, this is a minor annoyance, but after you are startled a number of times, it starts getting to you.The video quality is also rather poor.  The episodes appear *very* dark and murky.  Lots of details cannot be seen as they have faded into the shadows.  The prints used for syndication were a bit edited in places, yet they had MUCH more vibrant colors and were not as dark as the prints Rhino used.  If you saw the show in the 1970's, then you should remember how much more colorful it looked at that time.If you are lucky enough to own one of the early 1990's Japanese Laserdisc box sets, you'd know how much better those episodes look when compared to the ones released by Rhino.  The LD box only contained 40 of the 58 episodes, yet that's what I still reach for when I want to watch the show.Now, let me direct my attention to the audio commentaries:In a perfect world, all four of the Monkees would have done the commentaries together and they would have been complimentary to the producers who gave them the show, the fans who have supported it all of these years, and the other guys in the group.  In a less perfect world, they would have at least done a little fact-checking before they got behind the microphones.It's sad to say that in the Monkees' world, none of this happened.  All four of the Monkees (with the exception of Davy, maybe) don't come off very well.  Their commentaries are short on anecdotes, and collectively, they appear to be rather dysfunctional.  I'd bet that paychecks were driving force behind a few of the commentaries, not out of respect for the fans or the show.Micky comes off the worst.  He may have believed he was being cute and funny, but his rather obnoxious commentary is like a poor-man's version of MST3K.  He offers precious little insight into the episode he co-wrote and directed.  He is also quite blistering in his assessment of the 33 1/3 special.  It really seemed like he didn't want to do the commentary and he was carrying on just to prove a point.Mike seems to show bemusement that the show was and continues to be popular.  He says the intelligence level of the show appeals to 9-year olds.  He can't seem to understand that adults like (and continue to watch) the show.  While he has mellowed in regards to his place in the Monkees' legacy, it still appears he feels the show was beneath him (and that its fans might be too).Peter (or ""Former Monkee Peter Tork"" as he identifies himself at the start of each commentary) uses his commentaries as a platform to rip into Mike and (to a lesser extent) producer Rafelson.  Some of his Monkees' history is a bit faulty (like going on about how his song ""For Pete's Sake"" was edited onto the end of *first* season shows when the show was in syndication in the 70's - it wasn't).  Peter has replaced Mike as the group's curmudgeon.Davy is the only Monkee who is gracious to the others, and who appreciates the fans who have kept the show going for all these years.  His commentary is light on the facts and anecdotes, but it's not mean, dismissive, or obnoxious.  He definitely comes off the best.Conversely, the two non-Monkee commentaries here (by Bob Rafelson and Brian Auger) are the most informed and interesting.  Mr. Rafelson is very gracious to the group he created and he is very complimentary of the guys.  Mr. Auger shares some interesting insights about the 33 1/3 special and he never attacks it (unlike a certain Mr. Dolenz).  Both Rafelson &amp; Auger enhance this collection, unlike the Monkees themselves.So, unless AOL Time Warner / Rhino decides to spend the dough and really restore these classic TV episodes, then this rather disappointing collection is all we're going to get.  I recommend it for the inspired content it contains (the original episodes), not for its presentation.",3,Too Bad They Couldn't Follow The Beatles' Lead...Again!,1071273600,"12 13,

It has some commentaries on some of the episodes by each Monkee. Episode 48 has commentaries by Mike and Peter.  It was interesting to see the same show and hear 2 different points of view.  Bob Rafelson commented on the episode that he directed and it is about time we heard from the man who really created the Monkees. It also includes the Monkees special 33 and 1/3  Revolutions per Monkee commented on by Micky and Brian Auger who was the villian on the show.  There is also an interview with the editor Gerry Sheppard and a photo gallery.  The box is rather original as it is designed to look like an old portable record player from the 60's.  The sleeves of the disc look like the Monkees 45's.  A book is included on teh behind the scenes of the Monkees 2nd season written by Andrew Sandoval.  If you just want to hear and see the music videos without the episodes there is a feature that that will allow you to just play the videos.  After all they were the original MTV.

782752,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B0000TAZW4,Robert I. Hedges,"[1, 1]","When I was very young ""The Monkees"" (in reruns) was unquestionably my favorite television show. I liked the strange juxtopositions, the odd wordplay, and the genuinely funny comedic action. I still do. I bought this set to compliment season one (I generally prefer the first season) and on balance I really enjoyed revisiting these shows for the first time in several decades. By this time in the show, the four guys were drifting apart and becoming far more independent thinkers, and it really shows in the overall level of cohesiveness in some of the episodes. Having said that, there are no episodes here I didn't enjoy, though some are true standouts. The sole reason I deducted a star from my rating is that the audio and video quality is pretty much 1960's original, and really should have been cleaned up by Rhino. As a note, season two is now available in a much less expensive package that is more conventional (making storage much less problematic.)One thing I like about this set is the incredible trivia for each episode; the degree of minutiae covered is mindboggling and I examined it for every episode with great interest. One thing that's outstanding here are the cameos: I was most amused by Liberace in ""Art For Monkee's Sake"": the gold sledgehammer and Mike's reaction shots are utterly perfect in every way. Likewise Dub Taylor and Billie Hayes as Maw and Paw in ""Hillbilly Honeymoon"" are a riot. (Watch for Mike musically playing his nose and Peter as ""Uncle Raccoon."") For you ""Hogan's Heroes"" fans out there (and who isn't?) watch for Leon Askin as the head of the Druvanian National Ballet in the excellent Red Shoe episode (I am particularly fond of Peter's interrogation and in the performance of ""Chicken Lake."")I miss Mike in that episode, though he more than makes up for it with classic bits like his bumbling LBJ impression in ""Monkee Mayor,"" and his rambling poetic lute playing in ""The Wild Monkees"" (""You're a thing of beauty to behold, sitting like a manifold."" Keats would not be as amused as I was.) Mike also excels in the classic favorite ""Fairy Tales."" I enjoyed Peter's commentary regarding Nesmith's ""Daily Nightly"" on that episode: ""If these lyrics have any meaning, I never picked up on it."" (And all this time, I thought it was just me!) I appreciated all the commentaries, though some were better than others: Peter's frank discussion of drugs (he does not recommend them) is especially candid, thoughtful, and appreciated. Mike also steals the show in ""The Monkee's Paw"" as the Regular Lama, in which Peter opines ""While there is a great deal of moral purpose on the side of the unions, they tend to want a stranglehold."" I like that comment as it demonstrates an independent thought outside of the Hollywood mainstream: the show skewered both sides of the political spectrum with equal aplomb and efficacy. Mike's shining moment came in the famous role-reversal intro to ""The Monkees Blow Their Minds"" with special guest Frank Zappa, which is perhaps the best moment of the entire series. The same episode features a great cameo of Burgess Meredith in costume as The Penguin. Don't miss it.Micky really excels as a robot in ""Monkees Watch Their Feet"" (""Zlotnik welcomes you!"") The dual cameos of Stuart Margolin and Pat Paulsen makes this a comedic standout, though sadly there are some particularly bad scratches on the print that really needed to be cleaned up. Micky steps up as director on the final and most psychedelic episode, ""The Frodis Caper,"" which stars the great Rip Taylor as Wizard Glick. ""Some Like It Lukewarm"" has some great lines, including a dialogue centered on the setup line ""What is a woman but a rag, a bone, and a hank of hair?"" Mike's reaction to Davy in drag is classic and he's immediately labeled both ""a raggy, hairy bone"" and a ""hairy, bony rag."" This same episode features a better than average romp to ""The Door Into Summer"" in which Davy repeatedly attempts to escape.""The Monkees in Paris"" is not one of my favorites, and is probably the least entertaining of any episode in the series. Bob Rafelson does a commentary for it that's more interesting than the show itself, and describes the episode as a ""shambles."" The Rafelson commentary provides an interesting history of The Monkees, but it tends toward bloviation as he speaks of himself in the third person extensively. Despite that I still enjoyed ""The Monkees in Paris,"" though the same can't be said for ""33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee"" which was a post-series TV special that is ponderous and almost unwatchable. Don't believe me? Watch for the paisley forklift and the ""Origin of Species"" interpretative dance. (Really.) In his commentary Micky says ""This is what's known as 'deconstructing the Monkees.'"" He's absolutely correct. Although Neil Sedaka has a terrible contribution to ""33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee,"" there is solace to be had here in the form of a long but sublimely interesting version of ""Listen to the Band,"" a great song. That performance marked the last time the four played together until 1986.""The Monkees"" was groundbreaking television. Though much of the show was formulaic, the four principals really did have an effervescence that coalesced well on the small screen, and most of these episodes still hold up well today. I greatly enjoyed watching the second season for the first time in many years, and despite the technical shortcomings of this set, I recommend it without reservation.",4,"""To Dispose Of A Two-Headed

782753,A14ADG0TTI4XBV,B0000TAZW4,"Scott Coblio ""kookoo guy""","[4, 9]","Season Two looks a little tired in retrospect. The boys may have had more power, but they  sure didn't know what to do with it!  What kept Season One from being worthless pop trash was the earnest manner in which Mike, Micky, Peter and Davy applied themselves to farcical situations. Also the way the show would segue from comedy to (light) drama and back again. This complexity is what made the films of Charlie Chaplin such classics. Without that sincereity, farce no longer works. It becomes insulting to watch. And that's Season Two!  The only message seems to be that the Monkees hate being the Monkees and they think it's all stupid and so are you for watching. Not the best basis for comedy. So why watch? Well, because there are still some shining moments and great songs in the second season, in spite of all their efforts to muck it up.  While Peter's self righteous hippy trip and Micky's embarassing mugging may try your patience, keep watching and you'll hit lots of paydirt, even if it isn't of the same calibre as Season One.Micky Dolenz's commentary is gratingly shrill; if only he had taken a valium or something, he might have cut the shtick and come up with some insightful reminiscences, which is all anyone wants of these commentaries, isn't it? Mike's commentary is a little better in ""Fairy Tale"", which--surprisingly--he cites as the most fun he ever had making the show!As for the 33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee special at the end, it's painful to behold. Although, as an archivist, I'm still glad it's here. Even Micky in his commentary says at one point, ""Is it just me or is this really boring?""  I suppose it holds some morbid fascination, like the proverbial car crash that you just can't help but watch. But mostly, it's a chaotic and pretentious hodge podge that doesn't do much to credit the idea that the Monkees should have had complete control over their product. I much prefer them ""in bondage"" before the lunatics took over the asuylum! Still, this is a must for Monkee fans and they will just have to resign themselves to the fact that this time out, you have to weather some bad moments to get to the good ones.",5,MONKEES ARE A MUST,1069459200,"11 22, 2003",2003,2150,"['Season', 'Two', 'little', 'tired', 'retrospect', 'boys', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'power', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'What', 'kept', 'Season', 'One', 'being', 'worthless', 'pop', 'trash', 'was', 'earnest', 'manner', 'Mike', 'Micky', 'Peter', 'Davy', 'applied', 'farcical', 'situations', 'Also', 'way', 'show', 'would', 'segue', 'comedy', 'light', 'drama', 'back', 'again', 'complexity', 'what', 'made', 'films', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'such', 'classics', 'sincereity', 'farce', 'no', 'longer', 'insulting', 'watch', 'Season', 'Two', 'only', 'message', 'be', 'Monkees', 'hate', 'being', 'Monkees', 'think', 'stupid', 'so', 'are', 'watching', 'Not', 'best', 'basis', 'comedy', 'why', 'watch', 'Well', 'are', 'still', 'shining', 'moments', 'great', 'songs', 'second', 'season', 'spite', 'efforts', 'muck', 'up', 'Peter', 'righteous', 'hippy', 'trip', 'Micky', 'embarassing', 'mugging', 'may', 'try', 'patience', 'keep', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'hit', 'lots', 'paydirt', 'even', ""n't"", 'same', 'calibre', 'Season', 'One.Micky', 'Dolenz', 'commentary', 'gratingly', 'shrill', 'only', 'had', 'taken', 'valium', 'something', 'might', 'have', 'cut', 'shtick', 'come', 'up', 'insightful', 'reminiscences', 'anyone', 'commentaries', ""n't"", 'Mike', 'commentary', 'little', 'better', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'surprisingly', 'most', 'fun', 'ever', 'had', 'making', 'show', '33', '1/3', 'Revolutions', 'Per', 'Monkee', 'special', 'end', 'painful', 'behold', 'archivist', ""'m"", 'still', 'glad', 'here', 'Even', 'Micky', 'commentary', 'one', 'point', 'just', 'really', 'boring', 'suppose', 'morbid', 'fascination', 'proverbial', 'car', 'crash', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'watch', 'mostly', 'chaotic', 'pretentious', 'hodge', 'podge', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'credit', 'idea', 'Monkees', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'complete', 'control', 'product', 'much', 'prefer', 'bondage', 'lunatics', 'took', 'over', 'asuylum', 'Still', 'must', 'Monkee', 'fans', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'resign', 'fact', 'time', 'out', 'have', 'weather', 'bad', 'moments', 'get', 'good', 'ones']",The Monkees: Season 2

Micky, Davy, Mike and Peter ""make the world shine"" with offbeat romps such as ""The Devil and Peter Tork,"" ""Fairy Tale"" and ""The Frodis Caper."" The group's increased confidence and creative control resulted in some of their finest songs. ""Pleasant Valley Sunday,"" ""Goin' Down,"" ""Randy Scouse Git"" and ""Salesman"" are among the music-video highlights. Rhino's five-DVD set includes all 26 episodes plus the 1969 special ""33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee"" - an uneven yet subversive pop-culture document with memorable appearances by Fats Domino, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis. Contrary to popular belief, it was The Monkees' creative differences with NBC - not poor ratings - that ended the series. Dolenz, Jones, Nesmith and Tork should have agreed to a third season, since they partially won the battle to eliminate the sitcom format and were just hitting their stride as performers.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[12, 12]","It seems that I've been prefacing my Amazon reviews a lot lately by stating that Amazon has a dumb policy of grouping reviews of ALL releases of any video. If I film was released on VHS and later on DVD and then on Blu-ray, ALL the reviews appear on all products. So readers should always click on ""Newest First"" and look at date review is posted.This is the case of this Complete Monkees Season TWO. The set was released on DVD yesterday by Eagle Rock Entertainment, and yet there are 35 reviews of it going back to 2003, when Rhino first released the six-disc set - in a package that looked like a record play and had a list price of about $89.95. The new set from Eagle Rock comes in a much more conservative foldout digipak and lists for $39.95. After watching much of this new set - and reading details of the prior Rhino release, it most definitely appears that this is just a re-packaging of the earlier set at a price reduction of about 50% - an a package that will be easier to store. All the bonus features are the ones listed for the earlier set. So, if you already own the earlier volume, there is no need to purchase this one. BUT...... if you didn't buy it because of the price, now's your chance.I was never a huge fan of the show but did watch it occasionally, hoping that there would be lots of musical performances. But there weren't as I learned then and remembered as I watched these DVDs. Most of the music came during the ""romps"" (scenes where Monkees' hits would play in the background. There is an option to just watch the romps on this set (same as earlier one) and they rarely ran much over a minute each.There is lots of bonus material here with multiple commentaries from the cast or directors.  And this set contains The TV special ""33 1/3 revolutions per Monkee"" And there are the vintage Kellogg's commercials. But the prints have not been newly remastered and the color quality does vary.I was attracted to the set to see how much I remembered and to re-watch an episode I remembered well (well, pretty well) with guest star -local Philly DJ Jerry Blavat. It was nice to see again. And I've spent hours with this set already - as well as with Season One (see separate review), hitting the fast forward button only occasionally when things got a bit too ""silly""I won't rehash comments from many of the reviews from 2003 because they pretty much remain the same. The Monkees were TV icons of the 1960s and have a very strong fan base. That base will want to own this set - again, if they don't have it already.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,The 2003 Rhino release of Season 2 repackaged at half the price - and easier to store.,1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,2573,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'prefacing', 'Amazon', 'lot', 'lately', 'stating', 'Amazon', 'dumb', 'policy', 'grouping', 'reviews', 'ALL', 'releases', 'video', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'VHS', 'later', 'DVD', 'then', 'Blu-ray', 'ALL', 'reviews', 'appear', 'products', 'readers', 'should', 'always', 'click', 'Newest', 'First', 'look', 'date', 'review', 'posted.This', 'case', 'Complete', 'Monkees', 'Season', 'TWO', 'set', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'yesterday', 'Eagle', 'Rock', 'Entertainment', 'yet', 'are', '35', 'reviews', 'going', 'back', '2003', 'when', 'Rhino', 'first', 'released', 'six-disc', 'set', 'package', 'looked', 'record', 'play', 'had', 'list', 'price', '89.95', 'new', 'set', 'Eagle', 'Rock', 'much', 'more', 'conservative', 'foldout', 'digipak', 'lists', '39.95', 'watching', 'much', 'new', 'set', 'reading', 'details', 'prior', 'Rhino', 'release', 'most', 'definitely', 'just', 're-packaging', 'earlier', 'set', 'price', 'reduction', 'about', '50', '%', 'package', 'will', 'be', 'easier', 'store', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'ones', 'listed', 'earlier', 'set', 'So', 'already', 'own', 'earlier', 'volume', 'need', 'purchase', 'one', 'BUT', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'price', 'now', 'chance.I', 'was', 'never', 'huge', 'fan', 'show', 'did', 'watch', 'occasionally', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'lots', 'musical', 'performances', 'were', ""n't"", 'learned', 'then', 'remembered', 'watched', 'DVDs', 'Most', 'music', 'came', 'romps', 'scenes', 'where', 'Monkees', 'hits', 'would', 'play', 'background', 'option', 'just', 'watch', 'romps', 'set', 'same', 'earlier', 'one', 'rarely', 'ran', 'much', 'minute', 'lots', 'bonus', 'material', 'here', 'multiple', 'commentaries', 'cast', 'directors', 'set', 'TV', 'special', '33', '1/3', 'revolutions', 'Monkee', 'are', 'vintage', 'Kellogg', 'commercials', 'prints', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'newly', 'remastered', 'color', 'quality', 'vary.I', 'was', 'attracted', 'set', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'remembered', 're-watch', 'episode', 'remembered', 'well', 'well', 'pretty', 'well', 'guest', 'star', '-local', 'Philly', 'DJ', 'Jerry', 'Blavat', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'again', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'hours', 'set', 'already', 'as', 'well', 'Season', 'One', 'see', 'separate', 'review', 'hitting', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'only', 'occasionally', 'when', 'things', 'got', 'bit', 'too', 'silly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rehash', 'comments', 'many', 'reviews', '2003', 'pretty', 'much', 'remain', 'same', 'Monkees', 'were', 'TV', 'icons', '1960s', 'have', 'very', 'strong', 'fan', 'base', 'base', 'will', 'want', 'own', 'set', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'already.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",The Monkees: Season 2

782759,AMWL7XIWIPXEZ,B0000TAZW4,Twiddles42,"[33, 33]","While season 1 of ""The Monkees"" had a handful of episodes, it is season 2 that has a fresher, more genuine off-the-wall feel to it.And, by the end of season 1, critics were complaining that the mnusic wasn't ""theirs"".  As a result of this and Mike Nesmith's subsequent prodding, the music used in this season was done BY the Monkees and not behind-the-scenes artists.  Many songs that even bested some of the ""legit"" music of the time, include ""Salesman"", ""For Pete's Sake"", ""Randy Scouse Git"", ""The Door into Summer"", ""Zor and Zam"", ""Daily Nightly"", ""Pleasant Valley Sunday"", ""You Just May Be The One"", ""You Told Me"", and there are many others...The best episodes include:* Monkees Marooned (Peter sells his guitar for a treasure map and, after being berated by the others is joined by the others to see what it's about.  The one liners in this one are great...)* The Picture Frame (The group is conned into pulling a bank robbery by a ""producer"" who is actually a crook!)* Monkee Mayor (Mike Nesmith runs for mayor in an attempt to drive out the corrupt incumbant.  One of my top 5.)* Hillbilly Honeymoon (A spoof of The Beverly Hillbillies and ironically more realistic...  One of my top 5.)* Fairy Tale (A surreal and outrageous spoof on old fairy tales; Mike also dresses up in drag and there's a lot of fun to be had here.  The lack of laugh track is also intriguing.  Another top 5.)* The Devil and Peter Tork.  (A great plot, which contains one of their best-ever songs, almost banned by NBC because of a hidden drug reference (though the song is clearly AGAINST drugs...).  It's my absolute favorite.  (the 5th one being, of course, ""Monkee vs Machine"" but that's season 1...))* Mijacogeo (aka ""The Frodis Caper"") - unusual social commentary about television, even if the story is written and directed in such a bizarre (and likely deliberate) manner by Mickey Dolenz himself.As for the DVDs themselves:Menu/layout:A+++ for the menuing system.  I was impressed by the use of audio noise between the master and sub-menus, and the layout.  Very impressed indeed.Trivia:A nice addition with some interesting bits and pieces, along with guest cast filmography.Video:Colors look deep and saturated and flesh tones remarkably accurate from a filmed ~38 year old show.  As the show was filmed and not taped, that has led toThe prints seem reasonably sharp too.There are some dust and other film-related issues, but that is unavoidable and I only know of one TV show whose restoration team actually removes by hand all signs of scratches and dust...The only problem is DVD compression artifacting, which tends to make the picture seem a bit muddy; particularly with background/darker areas; they suffer the most from this artifacting.  It's not entirely bad, but bad enough for me to make a mention of.  :-)Audio:Sounds great but please stick to the standard Dolby 2.0 mono.  I tried out the 5.1 and maybe they thought the viewer ought to be on LSD while listening to the show.  The 5.1 produces a very bizarre sort of echo effect that makes everything difficult to understand.  And as I don't have this problem with any of my other 5.1 movies/shows, it must then be a problem with the encoding.  But the Dolby 2.0 is crisp and clean; like how it was originally, minus that wretched hiss.  :-)In short, the MSRP is too high.  Buying it used or clearance would be a better choice; $80 for BOTH seasons is a much fairer price given the video quality and that bizarre 5.1 transfer (B+ for effort but they needn't have bothered to take this step.  I'd rather have better compression for the video.)It's quite acceptable quality in the end, especially when compared to offerings from certain other vendors, who clearly don't put much time into their releases at all.",4,Better than season 1!,1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,3762,"['season', '1', 'Monkees', 'had', 'handful', 'episodes', 'season', '2', 'fresher', 'more', 'genuine', 'off-the-wall', 'feel', 'it.And', 'end', 'season', '1', 'critics', 'were', 'complaining', 'mnusic', 'was', ""n't"", 'theirs', 'result', 'Mike', 'Nesmith', 'subsequent', 'prodding', 'music', 'used', 'season', 'was', 'done', 'BY', 'Monkees', 'not', 'behind-the-scenes', 'artists', 'Many', 'songs', 'even', 'bested', 'legit', 'music', 'time', 'include', 'Salesman', 'Pete', 'Sake', 'Randy', 'Scouse', 'Git', 'Door', 'Summer', 'Zor', 'Zam', 'Daily', 'Nightly', 'Pleasant', 'Valley', 'Sunday', 'Just', 'May', 'Be', 'One', 'Told', 'Me', 'are', 'many', 'others', 'best', 'episodes', 'include', '*', 'Monkees', 'Marooned', 'Peter', 'guitar', 'treasure', 'map', 'being', 'berated', 'others', 'joined', 'others', 'see', 'what', 'about', 'one', 'liners', 'one', 'are', 'great', '*', 'Picture', 'Frame', 'group', 'conned', 'pulling', 'bank', 'robbery', 'producer', 'who', 'actually', 'crook', '*', 'Monkee', 'Mayor', 'Mike', 'Nesmith', 'mayor', 'attempt', 'drive', 'out', 'corrupt', 'incumbant', 'One', 'top', '5', '*', 'Hillbilly', 'Honeymoon', 'A', 'spoof', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', 'ironically', 'more', 'realistic', 'One', 'top', '5', '*', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'A', 'surreal', 'outrageous', 'spoof', 'old', 'fairy', 'tales', 'Mike', 'also', 'up', 'drag', 'lot', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'here', 'lack', 'laugh', 'track', 'also', 'intriguing', 'top', '5', '*', 'Devil', 'Peter', 'Tork', 'great', 'plot', 'one', 'best-ever', 'songs', 'almost', 'banned', 'NBC', 'hidden', 'drug', 'reference', 'song', 'clearly', 'AGAINST', 'drugs', 'absolute', 'favorite', '5th', 'one', 'being', 'course', 'Monkee', 'vs', 'Machine', 'season', '1', '*', 'Mijacogeo', 'Frodis', 'Caper', 'unusual', 'social', 'commentary', 'television', 'even', 'story', 'written', 'directed', 'such', 'bizarre', 'likely', 'deliberate', 'manner', 'Mickey', 'Dolenz', 'himself.As', 'DVDs', 'Menu/layout', 'A+++', 'menuing', 'system', 'was', 'impressed', 'use', 'audio', 'noise', 'master', 'sub-menus', 'layout', 'Very', 'impressed', 'indeed.Trivia', 'nice', 'addition', 'interesting', 'bits', 'pieces', 'guest', 'cast', 'filmography.Video', 'Colors', 'look', 'deep', 'saturated', 'flesh', 'tones', 'remarkably', 'accurate', 'filmed', '~38', 'year', 'old', 'show', 'show', 'was', 'filmed', 'not', 'taped', 'led', 'toThe', 'prints', 'seem', 'reasonably', 'sharp', 'are', 'dust', 'other', 'film-related', 'issues', 'unavoidable', 'only', 'know', 'one', 'TV', 'show', 'restoration', 'team', 'actually', 'hand', 'signs', 'scratches', 'dust', 'only', 'problem', 'DVD', 'compression', 'artifacting', 'make', 'picture', 'seem', 'bit', 'muddy', 'particularly', 'background/darker', 'areas', 'suffer', 'most', 'artifacting', 'not', 'entirely', 'bad', 'bad', 'enough', 'make', 'mention', 'Audio', 'great', 'please', 'stick', 'standard', 'Dolby', '2.0', 'mono', 'tried', '5.1', 'maybe', 'thought', 'viewer', 'ought', 'be', 'LSD', 'listening', 'show', '5.1', 'very', 'bizarre', 'sort', 'echo', 'effect', 'everything', 'difficult', 'understand', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'other', '5.1', 'movies/shows', 'must', 'then', 'be', 'problem', 'encoding', 'Dolby', '2.0', 'crisp', 'clean', 'how', 'was', 'originally', 'wretched', 'hiss', 'short', 'MSRP', 'too', 'high', 'Buying', 'used', 'clearance', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'choice', '80', 'BOTH', 'seasons', 'much', 'fairer', 'price', 'given', 'video', 'quality', 'bizarre', '5.1', 'transfer', 'B+', 'effort', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'bothered', 'take', 'step', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'better', 'compression', 'video', 'quite', 'acceptable', 'quality', 'end', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'offerings', 'certain', 'other', 'vendors', 'who', 'clearly', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'much', 'time', 'releases']",The Monkees: Season 2
