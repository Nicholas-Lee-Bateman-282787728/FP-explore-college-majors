The story line isn't as good and I wasn't impressed w/ some of the acting.  It is an option for older boys for something to watch w/ action etc.  I just wish they would release that other DVD...bummer.,3,It's alright...,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,291,"['What', 'wanted', 'buy', 'was', 'Horse', 'Sense', 'w/', 'Joey', 'Lawrence', 'Bought', 'give', 'chance', 'story', 'line', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'w/', 'acting', 'option', 'older', 'boys', 'something', 'watch', 'w/', 'action', 'etc', 'just', 'would', 'release', 'other', 'DVD', 'bummer']",Jumping Ship VHS

685832,AEPJYN0NAX9N4,B00005UQF5,Jody L. Schoth,"[0, 0]","There was so much more to this movie than just three guys shipwrecked!  There were lessons on the value of friends and family... and just how valuable material objects are.  But it's just like Disney to add a moral to a story... thank goodness!  This is the reason I feel comfortable turning on the Disney channel when our family sits down to watch a movie together.I really liked to see all the Lawrence brothers together, as well.  I still can't decide which is my favorite.  The movie had action, adventure, and drama all rolled into one.  Though the plot seemed unbelievable, it didn't seem completely impossible either... and usually I watch a movie for its entertainment value, not necessarily it's realistic possibilities.  Anyways, this is an excellent movie, the whole family will enjoy!",5,Excellent!,1033689600,"10 4, 2002",2002,796,"['was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'just', 'three', 'guys', 'shipwrecked', 'were', 'lessons', 'value', 'friends', 'family', 'just', 'how', 'valuable', 'material', 'objects', 'are', 'just', 'like', 'Disney', 'add', 'moral', 'story', 'thank', 'goodness', 'reason', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'turning', 'Disney', 'channel', 'when', 'family', 'down', 'watch', 'movie', 'together.I', 'really', 'liked', 'see', 'Lawrence', 'brothers', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'favorite', 'movie', 'had', 'action', 'adventure', 'drama', 'rolled', 'one', 'plot', 'seemed', 'unbelievable', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'completely', 'impossible', 'usually', 'watch', 'movie', 'entertainment', 'value', 'not', 'necessarily', 'realistic', 'possibilities', 'Anyways', 'excellent', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'will', 'enjoy']",Jumping Ship VHS

It was so good I couldn't get to sleep I had to keep watching it.  I wish I would have taped it on Windows Media Center, because now I can't find any showings on TV.  This is a sequel to the first movie ""Horse Sense"" which I can't find anywhere.  I would love to see the first movie, and wish I would have before this movie.  So I suggest that you watch Horse Sense first if you can find it, then this movie.  It keeps you on the edge of suspense every scene.  Very good movie with good twists and great ending.  Price for the DVD is way overpriced though.  They should have a DVD of the first and second movies on one, and charge like 14.99 like regular dvds are.  But anyways, 5 stars.",5,Fantastic Disney Original Movie,1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,773,"['was', 'up', 'late', 'last', 'night', 'played', 'Disney', 'Channel', '1:30', 'am', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'sleep', 'had', 'keep', 'watching', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'taped', 'Windows', 'Media', 'Center', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'showings', 'TV', 'sequel', 'first', 'movie', 'Horse', 'Sense', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anywhere', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'first', 'movie', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'movie', 'So', 'suggest', 'watch', 'Horse', 'Sense', 'first', 'can', 'find', 'then', 'movie', 'edge', 'suspense', 'scene', 'Very', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'twists', 'great', 'ending', 'Price', 'DVD', 'way', 'overpriced', 'should', 'have', 'DVD', 'first', 'second', 'movies', 'one', 'charge', '14.99', 'regular', 'dvds', 'are', '5', 'stars']",Jumping Ship VHS

(Andy needs another few years of bulking up.) Putting them together in a movie set on a tropical island, where they wear as little as possible, is a risky proposition -- who's going to pay attention to the plot?Ok, I didn't. There's some minor character-building and relationship problems with pat Disney-esque solutions. Joey bonds with Andy. Pirates attack. Andy bonds with Matt. Pirates kidnap Andy. Matt bonds with Joey. Etc. The conclusion is fairly touching, with the trio deciding to stay together even after their rescue -- I think they go into business together, but I'm not sure.
