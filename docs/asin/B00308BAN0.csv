1314840,A3AHDR4F2J7YXX,B00308BAN0,"Caliaha ""Caliaha""","[6, 11]","This DVD is worth the price just for the lovely Chakra meditation. The 12 minute meditation is lead by James D'Silvia. He has a lovely soothing voice. You can use this meditation any time of day to center yourself and is easy to follow.This is one of four DVDs in a series by Trudie Styler (although James is the star of the show). The ballet routine includes many of the moves that are in the Cardio dance video and is easy to follow flow moves like the other DVDs. It is not a difficult routine. There are two practices on the DVD and the only difference is the first one includes Trudie and uses a ballet bar (which I don't have) and the second uses two chairs and only includes James. James has a wonderful style that makes these exercise videos interesting and fun!There is an extra that shows Sting and Trudie's Tuscan estate. It is a beautiful place and they are beautiful people, but..... It made me sad, this beautiful big bass fish dead on the plate as they seasoned him up for cooking...for their life that is so wonderful. They have their own cooks and more resources that most of us. It seemed more of bragging than anything. I did not mark down on my 5-star rating of the video since the routine was so great!See many of my other review on Amazon, includes the others in this series.",5,Absolutely lovely meditation included by James D'Silva,1271980800,"04 23, 2010",2010,1297,"['DVD', 'price', 'just', 'lovely', 'Chakra', 'meditation', '12', 'minute', 'meditation', 'lead', 'James', ""D'Silvia"", 'lovely', 'soothing', 'voice', 'can', 'use', 'meditation', 'time', 'day', 'center', 'easy', 'follow.This', 'one', 'four', 'DVDs', 'series', 'Trudie', 'Styler', 'James', 'star', 'show', 'ballet', 'routine', 'many', 'moves', 'are', 'Cardio', 'dance', 'video', 'easy', 'follow', 'flow', 'moves', 'other', 'DVDs', 'not', 'difficult', 'routine', 'are', 'two', 'practices', 'DVD', 'only', 'difference', 'first', 'one', 'Trudie', 'ballet', 'bar', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'second', 'uses', 'two', 'chairs', 'only', 'James', 'James', 'wonderful', 'style', 'exercise', 'videos', 'interesting', 'fun', 'extra', 'Sting', 'Trudie', 'Tuscan', 'estate', 'beautiful', 'place', 'are', 'beautiful', 'people', 'made', 'sad', 'beautiful', 'big', 'bass', 'fish', 'dead', 'plate', 'seasoned', 'up', 'cooking', 'life', 'so', 'wonderful', 'have', 'own', 'cooks', 'more', 'resources', 'most', 'seemed', 'more', 'bragging', 'anything', 'did', 'not', 'mark', 'down', '5-star', 'rating', 'video', 'routine', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'See', 'many', 'other', 'review', 'Amazon', 'others', 'series']",Trudie Styler's Sculpt & Tone Ballet

Because of its deep bends and stretches and rapid pace and flow, it becomes a cardio workout if you apply the necessary focus. It is empowering, yet calming and meditative with its physicality and I need this to complete my physical fitness routine. The production is great, it's so aesthetic to the eye and ear. It's unfortunate that ""the Buddha"" is offensive to some. For me, it's not a promotion of religion, but rather a symbol of peace, love and harmony with the earth and does not seek to disregard anyone's religious beliefs.",5,Excellent workout!,1285459200,"09 26, 2010",2010,730,"['thought', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'workout', 'only', '25', 'minutes', 'found', 'perfectly', 'out', 'other', 'barre', 'workouts', 'do', 'Bar', 'Method', 'Pure', 'Barre', 'Core', 'Fusion', 'deep', 'bends', 'stretches', 'rapid', 'pace', 'flow', 'cardio', 'workout', 'apply', 'necessary', 'focus', 'empowering', 'yet', 'calming', 'meditative', 'physicality', 'need', 'complete', 'physical', 'fitness', 'routine', 'production', 'great', 'so', 'aesthetic', 'eye', 'ear', 'unfortunate', 'Buddha', 'offensive', 'not', 'promotion', 'religion', 'rather', 'symbol', 'peace', 'love', 'harmony', 'earth', 'not', 'seek', 'disregard', 'anyone', 'religious', 'beliefs']",Trudie Styler's Sculpt & Tone Ballet

Catching a peek at Sting & Trudie's Italian estate and their eco-farming is inspirational. Now onto the 25 minute Barre Routine: compared to using the chairs, this is such a pretty routine to watch that is. Watching ballet with Trudie & James did not seem intimidating. On the other hand, I worked out with The Chair Routine (25 minutes) and even though you do the same exact routine as the Barre, I found it challenging when the moves were in vertical direction and the pace was quicker. James was calling out positions fast ""passe, chasse, arabesque, tendu"". This is why I felt pretty winded both mentally and physically. So, get familiar with the ballet terms and positions for the feet AND arms in the Footwork Tutorial.

1314844,A32CVWPHQI86QS,B00308BAN0,"Nikisue ""Luvtoshop""","[7, 28]","I did not like this workout. It goes too fast and also, visually, I'm not sure why it is necessary to have the instructor doing ballet in front of a big Buddha statue the whole time. I find it distracting and annoying. I am a Christian but I would find it equally odd if there was a giant cross sitting behind the workout instructor. For me it comes off as a religious promotion and is intrusive to me. In fact, I have seen other workout videos by Gaiam productions and this seems to be the case in at least 2 other videos. I understand that they produce a lot of yoga videos and they use these types of symbols, but something about it bothers me. I don't like it and am returning it and will not buy any other of their products for that reason.Updated 6/08/13I just recently reviewed this review and almost deleted it because there were very few helpful votes & a few upset comments. So I re-read it to see if I could make it more helpful but I am changing nothing other than recommending some ballet dvd's that I do think are great. I realize that some people out there are upset by me being annoyed by a giant Buddha statue in the DVD but reviews are about saying why you like or dislike something. So if it's because the steps go too fast (being able to keep up definitely determines if you're going to use the video again or enjoy it) or the set is very distracting to you then those are valid reasons not to like a video. Any kind of large religious symbol (not just Buddha) in a ballet video would be out of place & distracting to me and I have never seen anything like this in any ballet studio. Seems like propaganda to me but if you don't mind that and are more experienced in picking up dance steps quickly then by all means buy it. My review stands. The ballet DVD's I highly recommend areKari Anderson: Reach - Upbeat Toning & Flexibility for a Dancer's BodyandElement: Ballet ConditioningandNew York City Ballet Workout.",2,giant buddha on the set,1279670400,"07 21, 2010",2010,1934,"['did', 'not', 'workout', 'too', 'fast', 'also', 'visually', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'necessary', 'have', 'instructor', 'doing', 'ballet', 'front', 'big', 'Buddha', 'statue', 'whole', 'time', 'find', 'distracting', 'annoying', 'am', 'Christian', 'would', 'find', 'equally', 'odd', 'was', 'giant', 'cross', 'sitting', 'workout', 'instructor', 'off', 'religious', 'promotion', 'intrusive', 'fact', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'workout', 'videos', 'Gaiam', 'productions', 'be', 'case', 'least', '2', 'other', 'videos', 'understand', 'produce', 'lot', 'yoga', 'videos', 'use', 'types', 'symbols', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'am', 'returning', 'will', 'not', 'buy', 'other', 'products', 'reason.Updated', '6/08/13I', 'just', 'recently', 'reviewed', 'review', 'almost', 'deleted', 'were', 'very', 'few', 'helpful', 'votes', 'few', 'upset', 'comments', 'So', 're-read', 'see', 'could', 'make', 'more', 'helpful', 'am', 'changing', 'nothing', 'other', 'recommending', 'ballet', 'dvd', 'do', 'think', 'are', 'great', 'realize', 'people', 'are', 'upset', 'being', 'annoyed', 'giant', 'Buddha', 'statue', 'DVD', 'reviews', 'are', 'saying', 'why', 'dislike', 'something', 'So', 'steps', 'go', 'too', 'fast', 'being', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'definitely', 'determines', ""'re"", 'going', 'use', 'video', 'again', 'enjoy', 'set', 'very', 'distracting', 'then', 'are', 'valid', 'reasons', 'not', 'like', 'video', 'kind', 'large', 'religious', 'symbol', 'not', 'just', 'Buddha', 'ballet', 'video', 'would', 'be', 'place', 'distracting', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'ballet', 'studio', 'propaganda', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'are', 'more', 'experienced', 'picking', 'up', 'dance', 'steps', 'quickly', 'then', 'means', 'buy', 'My', 'review', 'ballet', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommend', 'areKari', 'Anderson', 'Reach', 'Upbeat', 'Toning', 'Flexibility', 'Dancer', 'BodyandElement', 'Ballet', 'ConditioningandNew', 'York', 'City', 'Ballet', 'Workout']",Trudie Styler's Sculpt & Tone Ballet
1314845,A1D2Y0RG6D1ZSL,B00308BAN0,"Silly Sally ""Sally""","[22, 23]","I like the DVD because it does give you a ballet-based barre with nice music by David Hartley.  I wish other exercise companies would take a clue from this DVD and use decent music for ballet inspired workouts instead of the elevator crap or up-beat contemporary music which is usually offered. I understand that not everyone likes classical music, but doing ballet to elevator music is torture for me. The music here is serene but at the same time emotional, definitely not elevator music or 1980's jazzercise music either. As for the workout, the steps are ballet-inspired but some exercises are not done in the typical barre order, and some typical ballet barre exercises are missing. My only complaint is that I wish the DVD were longer and had some center work or some floor core work.  I also feel that some ballet experience is needed to do this workout.  If you have had some ballet training and would like to stay in shape at home, I would recommend this DVD over other workouts because the music is better(New York City Ballet workouts have wonderful classical music selections).  I also like how the exercises continue without explanation and stopping, but if you have not had any ballet training the lack of explanations will be a determent.  The workout is only one routine that is shown on a barre and a chair.",4,nice music and nice barre work/wish it had two routines or center work,1271289600,"04 15, 2010",2010,1324,"['like', 'DVD', 'give', 'ballet-based', 'barre', 'nice', 'music', 'David', 'Hartley', 'wish', 'other', 'exercise', 'companies', 'would', 'take', 'clue', 'DVD', 'use', 'decent', 'music', 'ballet', 'inspired', 'workouts', 'instead', 'elevator', 'crap', 'up-beat', 'contemporary', 'music', 'usually', 'offered', 'understand', 'not', 'everyone', 'likes', 'classical', 'music', 'doing', 'ballet', 'elevator', 'music', 'torture', 'music', 'here', 'serene', 'same', 'time', 'emotional', 'definitely', 'not', 'elevator', 'music', '1980', 'jazzercise', 'music', 'either', 'workout', 'steps', 'are', 'ballet-inspired', 'exercises', 'are', 'not', 'done', 'typical', 'barre', 'order', 'typical', 'ballet', 'barre', 'exercises', 'are', 'missing', 'only', 'complaint', 'wish', 'DVD', 'were', 'longer', 'had', 'center', 'work', 'floor', 'core', 'work', 'also', 'feel', 'ballet', 'experience', 'needed', 'do', 'workout', 'have', 'had', 'ballet', 'training', 'would', 'like', 'stay', 'shape', 'home', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'other', 'workouts', 'music', 'better', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Ballet', 'workouts', 'have', 'wonderful', 'classical', 'music', 'selections', 'also', 'how', 'exercises', 'continue', 'explanation', 'stopping', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'ballet', 'training', 'lack', 'explanations', 'will', 'be', 'determent', 'workout', 'only', 'one', 'routine', 'shown', 'barre', 'chair']",Trudie Styler's Sculpt & Tone Ballet
