1492910,A2W5F8CRQWDW4,B005LAJ22Q,,"[0, 0]","By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Miss.The Walking Dead is one of the best adaptations from a comic book I've run across.I don't believe in zombies, but if I did, this is how I'd imagine it. I like the fact that the entire series was shot with 16mm and shot in the south, Grantville, GA. The police chief says to beware if you visit between now and Sept. 20.""Please plan your routes accordingly.  In addition, you may hear gun fire associated with the filming so don't be alarmed,"" Interim Chief Jordan said.In season two, our reluctant leader Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) is taking the group of survivors to Fort Benning. They come across a traffic jam. While trying to clear the road to get the vehicles moving, a large group of walkers (what they call the zombies) approaches.One of the small girls in the group, Sophia, is chased out from under the relative safety of the vehicle and becomes lost in the woods. Rick and Daryl Dixon, one of the tougher survivors, organize a search party.Rick has a constant fight with other survivors about his decisions, plus his wife, Lori, is pregnant, but he doesn't know it. Thinking he was dead, she had an affair with his best friend and fellow officer, Shane Walsh.While Rick, his son Carl and Shane are looking for Sophia, they come across a deer. The boy goes to pet the animal, when a shot from the opposite direction kills the deer, the bullet goes through and is lodged in Carl. They end up on a large isolated farm run by veterinarian, Hershel Greene.Greene patches up the boy, but clearly doesn't want this new group staying. More conflict arrises when it's discovered he's locked several walkers in the barn, not wanting to kill them because some were family.

There are characters you'll love - and those you love to hate ... and it's led to many interesting discussions between my son and I (he's hating Andrea at the moment, and I personally want to drop kick Lori! - and we both love Dale and Daryl!)Most of Season 2 was fun to watch but nothing dramatic until the last couple of episodes - and believe me they ended the season with a show we watched several times just because it was so spectacular - and my son was fascinated by the chick at the end with the zombies on leashes.The makeup artists did an amazing job with all the costumes and makeup so the gore is perfect without being overwhelming and quite honestly it's sinfully fun to sit down and enjoy watching the episodes knowing that it's something I do not normally watch... in fact it's one of the few shows I do enjoy watching and look forward to each new episode.Onto the extras... Since we never watched the webisodes (slow internet and limited bandwith), we were captivated by them but the whole time I wondered how it played into the series - besides the zombies, fear and struggle to survive but then at the end we realized just how it fit - and then Cody decided we must watch both seasons all over again because he's sure there are other things he missed the first couple times - and I'll be right there watching it with him.On a more personal note however, my son hates to read but after watching the first season he was curious about the books so I bought him the entire series.  He's read them all and keeps pointing out the differences between the books and the series so he really appreciated the extra that explains why they changed the order some of the events happened.I'm so ready for Season 3 to start!  Unfortunately will have to be downloading the episodes since our television network no longer carries AMC... but refuse to miss them!",5,love this series!,1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,2383,"['totally', 'blame', 'son', 'getting', 'series', 'so', 'love', 'watching', 'had', 'marathon', 'once', 'Season', '2', 'arrived', 'house', 'watched', 'seasons', 'back', 'back', 'then', 'dived', 'extras.Regardless', 'what', 'think', 'Shane', 'Carl', 'Lori', 'Rick', 'Glen', 'Dale', 'Daryl', 'Andrea', 'Hershel', 'Maggie', 'other', 'characters', 'series', 'struggle', 'survive', 'fascinating', 'what', 'really', 'attention', ""'bratty"", 'attitudes', 'backstabbing', 'arguments', 'amongst', 'survivors', 'are', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'love', 'love', 'hate', 'led', 'many', 'interesting', 'discussions', 'son', 'hating', 'Andrea', 'moment', 'personally', 'want', 'drop', 'kick', 'Lori', 'love', 'Dale', 'Daryl', 'Most', 'Season', '2', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'nothing', 'dramatic', 'last', 'couple', 'episodes', 'believe', 'ended', 'season', 'show', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'just', 'was', 'so', 'spectacular', 'son', 'was', 'fascinated', 'chick', 'end', 'zombies', 'leashes.The', 'makeup', 'artists', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'costumes', 'makeup', 'so', 'gore', 'perfect', 'being', 'overwhelming', 'quite', 'honestly', 'sinfully', 'fun', 'sit', 'down', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'episodes', 'knowing', 'something', 'do', 'not', 'normally', 'watch', 'fact', 'one', 'few', 'shows', 'do', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'look', 'forward', 'new', 'extras', 'never', 'watched', 'webisodes', 'slow', 'internet', 'limited', 'bandwith', 'were', 'captivated', 'whole', 'time', 'wondered', 'how', 'played', 'series', 'zombies', 'fear', 'struggle', 'survive', 'then', 'end', 'realized', 'just', 'how', 'fit', 'then', 'Cody', 'decided', 'must', 'watch', 'seasons', 'over', 'again', 'sure', 'are', 'other', 'things', 'missed', 'first', 'couple', 'times', ""'ll"", 'be', 'right', 'there', 'watching', 'more', 'personal', 'note', 'however', 'son', 'read', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'curious', 'books', 'bought', 'entire', 'series', 'read', 'keeps', 'pointing', 'out', 'differences', 'books', 'series', 'really', 'appreciated', 'extra', 'why', 'changed', 'order', 'events', 'happened.I', ""'m"", 'so', 'ready', 'Season', '3', 'start', 'Unfortunately', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'downloading', 'episodes', 'television', 'network', 'no', 'longer', 'AMC', 'refuse', 'miss']",N/A

1492943,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B005LAJ22Q,,"[0, 0]","Let's be honest, I never really was into zombie movies and the like. Except for the occasional 'high profile' films that would come out(like Romero's 'Living Dead' series, 28 Days/Weeks  Later, Zombieland), I'd stay away from them. I always figured that if you seen one, you seen 'em all. Then, when I saw this show, all that changed. I caught the fever and can't seem to get enough of them. I'm sure you can tell by my reviews, I have to get my daily 'zombie' fix or else. I'm addicted, what can I say?The second season opens with Rick and his group of survivors leaving Atlanta.  They come to the decision that Fort Benning will be their next destination. Along the way, they come across a traffic jam of abandoned vehicles on I-85. The group loots several vehicles. When a large horde of walkers approach, they're forced to hide under the vehicles. Sophia is chased away from the camp by two of the remaining walkers and she runs off into the woods. Carl is accidentally shot during the initial search for her. Otis, the man who accidently shot Carl, leads Rick and Shane to a large, isolated farm owned by a veterinarian named Hershel Greene. And that, folks, is basically where it all begins.You're going to be surprised because alot of things happen this season that you might not have expected to happen..especially with the season finale, which was viewed by a record-breaking 9.0 million viewers, making it the highest rated episode of the series, and the most viewed episode of an original series on AMC, in history.The thing I love most about the show is how Rick and the group deal with having to fight to live in this terrifying new world. Not only that but how they are changed by the overwhelming realization that those who survive can be far more dangerous than the mindless zombies that roam the earth. Most of the things they do mirror what we would do in a given situation such as that.If I had any gripes, it would be that there are several characters who stories I would like to see(Daryl, T-Dog and Sophia's Mom, for example). For the moment, at least, their stories hadn't been told and I know that they'd have good stories to tell.At any rate, the second season is great and even better than the first. I can't wait til the complete third season is released on DVD. Lol, course- that will be awhile as it hasn't even begun yet. If you're just now hearing about AMC's The Walking Dead, I suggest you get seasons one and two and catch up on the storyline. I guarantee that you won't be disappointed. If my wife will get into a show like this when she normally dislikes watching stuff like this, you know there must be something there that drives her to watch(and it's clear it's not to see the zombies chow down, lol). It's a great show. Intense, exciting, & compelling.

1492962,A19B0WUZCH8I4R,B005LAJ22Q,,"[0, 0]","The first season of this show was often clumsy with its unfamiliar characters, and usually focused too much on the zombie/horror aspect, which we had all seen too many times before to be much affected by ... In other words, because we didn't know much about these characters, we didn't care too much about their efforts; whether they survived or not was a matter mostly of indifference. The presentation was amazing, yes, but still, the show only showed promise; it was not a good product.Season two is different, an amazing experience. The characters are developed in such a way, and the zombie world portrayed in such a dramatic light, that it transcends the horror genre and becomes more theater than anything. Wonderful stuff, almost Shakespearean. Some of the best writing I have ever seen for television. Brilliant acting and direction, with a superb cast. The Rick versus Shane subplot is amazing for several reasons: 1st, the anti-hero is portrayed as being superficially right, but morally wrong, so that we are led to question which is the more valuable trait in this world, the survivalist instincts Shane possesses, or the conscience of a moral man, which Rick maintains. Rick (the moralist) is consistently wrong in his decisions, yet has the favor of the group, whereas the villain of the season becomes Shane, who has nonetheless acted more heroically than any of the others. Yet in the end, who lives and who dies in this new world, and why? A wonderful paradox unfolding, very engaging to watch. The romantic triangle between Rick, Shane, and Laurie is deep in a way that puts most other television writers' efforts to shame. You have the fact that Shane is responsible for saving Rick's family again and again; without him, he would have no reason to continue on. And you have the nature of Laurie's love, a continual question. Did she love Shane or only find comfort with him? And you have Shane's love, continually disregarded throughout both seasons (as Rick declares to him at one pivotal point in the story, ""You think you love Laurie, but you don't."" The viewer, meanwhile, is not so sure.) It could even be argued in the last two episodes that the anti-hero becomes the hero only to be killed by the hero turned anti-hero. In any case, it's a very thoughtful underpinning to the whole.I found other plot developments nearly as engaging: the vain efforts to find Sophia, the ""judge, jury, and executioner"" episode, where Rick is called on (again) to decide which is more important: the safety of the group, or the preservation of his humanity, and the whole hope issue in a world where civilization has vanished and mankind faces its ""extinction event."" This last was toyed with in the final episodes of the first season, but not nearly so well as here.A beautiful scene unfolds in a deserted bar between Rick and another survivor that I found striking: it is impossible to tell who is acting rightly and who in the gray or the black, who the villain. Everyone and everything is mixed up here, heroes and villains, friends and enemies.Shane soon proceeds down a path to murder Rick ostensibly ""for the good of the group"" yet does not do so, placing his weapon back in his belt at one point and raising his arms. We are given the feeling that he may not be capable of murdering his friend outright. A great scene.Not anything to complain about here, other than I wish there was more of it. The Walking Dead seasons are too short.",5,"Wonderful, a Nearly Perfect Effort",1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,3452,"['first', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'often', 'clumsy', 'unfamiliar', 'characters', 'usually', 'focused', 'too', 'much', 'zombie/horror', 'aspect', 'had', 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'be', 'much', 'affected', 'other', 'words', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'efforts', 'survived', 'not', 'was', 'matter', 'mostly', 'indifference', 'presentation', 'was', 'amazing', 'yes', 'still', 'show', 'only', 'showed', 'promise', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'product.Season', 'two', 'different', 'amazing', 'experience', 'characters', 'are', 'developed', 'such', 'way', 'zombie', 'world', 'portrayed', 'such', 'dramatic', 'light', 'horror', 'genre', 'more', 'theater', 'anything', 'Wonderful', 'stuff', 'almost', 'Shakespearean', 'best', 'writing', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'television', 'Brilliant', 'acting', 'direction', 'superb', 'cast', 'Rick', 'versus', 'Shane', 'subplot', 'amazing', 'several', 'reasons', '1st', 'anti-hero', 'portrayed', 'being', 'superficially', 'right', 'morally', 'wrong', 'are', 'led', 'question', 'more', 'valuable', 'trait', 'world', 'survivalist', 'Shane', 'possesses', 'conscience', 'moral', 'man', 'Rick', 'Rick', 'moralist', 'consistently', 'wrong', 'decisions', 'yet', 'favor', 'group', 'villain', 'season', 'Shane', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'acted', 'more', 'heroically', 'others', 'end', 'who', 'who', 'new', 'world', 'why', 'wonderful', 'paradox', 'unfolding', 'very', 'engaging', 'watch', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'Rick', 'Shane', 'Laurie', 'deep', 'way', 'most', 'other', 'television', 'writers', 'efforts', 'shame', 'have', 'fact', 'Shane', 'responsible', 'saving', 'Rick', 'family', 'again', 'again', 'would', 'have', 'reason', 'continue', 'have', 'nature', 'Laurie', 'love', 'continual', 'question', 'Did', 'love', 'Shane', 'only', 'find', 'comfort', 'have', 'Shane', 'love', 'continually', 'disregarded', 'seasons', 'Rick', 'one', 'pivotal', 'point', 'story', 'think', 'love', 'Laurie', 'do', ""n't"", 'viewer', 'meanwhile', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'argued', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'anti-hero', 'hero', 'only', 'be', 'killed', 'hero', 'turned', 'anti-hero', 'case', 'very', 'thoughtful', 'underpinning', 'whole.I', 'found', 'other', 'plot', 'developments', 'nearly', 'engaging', 'vain', 'efforts', 'find', 'Sophia', 'judge', 'jury', 'executioner', 'episode', 'where', 'Rick', 'called', 'again', 'decide', 'more', 'important', 'safety', 'group', 'preservation', 'humanity', 'whole', 'hope', 'issue', 'world', 'where', 'civilization', 'vanished', 'mankind', 'extinction', 'event', 'last', 'was', 'toyed', 'final', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'well', 'here.A', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'unfolds', 'deserted', 'bar', 'Rick', 'survivor', 'found', 'striking', 'impossible', 'tell', 'who', 'acting', 'rightly', 'who', 'gray', 'black', 'who', 'villain', 'Everyone', 'everything', 'mixed', 'up', 'here', 'heroes', 'villains', 'friends', 'enemies.Shane', 'soon', 'proceeds', 'down', 'path', 'murder', 'Rick', 'ostensibly', 'good', 'group', 'yet', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'placing', 'weapon', 'back', 'belt', 'one', 'point', 'raising', 'arms', 'are', 'given', 'feeling', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'capable', 'murdering', 'friend', 'outright', 'great', 'scene.Not', 'anything', 'complain', 'here', 'other', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'seasons', 'are', 'too', 'short']",N/A

The original premise - a man wakes up weeks after zombies have overtaken the country, travels hundreds of miles to Atlanta, then gets reunited with his wife and child after being saved by someone that is camping with his family - is so stupid James Patterson could have written it.But the awkward setups and tone-deaf dialogue isn't the point of this show.

I will give the highlights of the season (some spoilers) for fans of the show or people who have yet to watch the show but wonder about it and might want to buy the show.  The first show shows how family, friends, and people you care about stay together and live on even though walkers all around the area.  The second they get medical attention for Rick's son...another character will die if doesn't get medical treatment T-Dogg.  On the thrid show you still have the group looking for Sofia and Shane comes back with supplies.  Fourth show they have to close off a well because of walker inside it.  Show Five you have some of the chacters thinking back before the world of walkers, Darrel gets injured and walkers attack him, then Glenn finds a surpise in the barn.  Show Six the truth comes out and Rick finds out his wife is pregant.  Show Seven Glenn tells the group about the barn, Shane takes the guns from Dale and goes to the barn, Rick and group frozen when they see what comes out of the barn,  Rick makes a hard choice and shoots.  One of the actors on True Blood guest stars in a scene in Show Eight.  Show Nine tensions getting bigger between Rick and Shane looks like there is going to be a showdown between the two of them sooner or later.  Show Ten Rick and Shane have there fight and end up being attack by walkers and you choice if you really want to live or die.  Show Eleven Rick's son doesn't believe in Heaven when talking back to one of the characters about Sofia, Dale leaves the house after a choice was made he didn't like and finds a dead animal and then attack by a walker, Darrel makes a hard choice for the dying Dale.  Show Tweleve the group reenforces the farm to protect it from walkers and any other dangers, Shane, Rick, Glenn and Darrel go try to find the escape prisoner Randell only to have Darrel find him with a broken neck.  Then Shane pulls a gun on Rick for final showdown Rick tries to talk sense into him but can't so has to get rid of Shane somehow.  Then the Final show of season Walkers make it to the farm, The group realizes the farm is no more and burns the barn to try get out of the farm and live on.  Then Rick tells the group the truth he has kept secret since season one (to find out you have to buy season two).  Plus Rick tells Laurie the truth about him and Shane, and what Carl did to Shane afterwards.  Great Special Features about the music of the seaon, make up amazing job on that, plus almost 30 minutes of delated scenes to add to the storylines.

1492989,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B005LAJ22Q,,"[0, 1]","After the rip-roaring success of Season 1, ""The Walking Dead"" would have been hard pressed to meet or exceed the standard set.  However, Season 2 was such an incredible let down that it almost wiped out all the goodwill, and positive buzz, the series had generated.  I know that I very nearly swore off the show after enduring 13 episodes of the most mind-numbingly boring television on the air.Season 2 starts with the survivors of the destruction of the CDC on the road, looking for their next sanctuary, when they encounter a swarm of walkers.  During the attempt to wait out the swarm, Carol's daughter, Sophia, gets lost.  During the initial search, Carl gets shot accidentally.  In desperation to find help for his son, Rick discovers Hershel's farm.  This promising start to the season is completely undone over the next several episodes.Each episode in the first half of the season consisted of:  going out to search for Sophia, not finding her, killing a couple walkers, attempts at character development that weren't even two-dimensional, and profoundly stupid, non-sensical actions by main characters.  The only parts of the season that could remotely be considered exciting were the stunning reveal at the end of the first half of the season and the major zombie battle at the end of the second half.  The rest of the season was pathetically poor attempts to add depth to the characters that came off as ways to artificially extend different story lines just to film more episodes (Season 3 would suffer from this, too).Part of the reason for this major backslide was that series creator, Frank Darabont, got ousted from the show after the exciting Season 1.  Glen Mazzara replaced Darabont as showrunner for Seasons 2 and 3, and can rightfully be considered 'the guy who who nearly killed the series'.  A lack of sense of pacing, characterization and plot development plagued Mazzara's tenure.  If he had not been replaced by Scott Gimple for Season 4, leading to ""The Walking Dead""'s revitalization, I predict the series would not have survived past a fifth season.

I don't actively seek them out.  I have a vast dvd collection, yet do not possess one single zombie flick..... until now, (having bought season one of the Walking Dead a few months back). I will be increasing that theme ratio in the near future with more additions, even the one which frightened me as a child.... the original, old black and white ""Night of the Living Dead"".  I can look back now and see how campy it was, but it terrified me horribly as a wee bee and that may be why I did not become a huge fan of the genre.What can one say about season two of the Walking Dead?  It's definitely not like season one.  But then, season one had only six episodes to draw the viewer in to this new world order.  It was expertly done and people got hooked.  Season two is dealing with growing pains, both onscreen and off.  It has more episodes to attempt to flesh out the storyline, and doesn't have that frenetic pace that season one did.  The storyline did plod along in spots, but it allowed us to get to know new characters and allow us to become concerned about them.  (I still wonder what happened to Morgan and Duane, whether we'll ever run across a zombified Jim, how the Vatos fared, or the Hispanic family who took off in a different direction).In the search for one of their missing members, and also needing medical assistance, our group seems to have finally found the idyllic sanctuary they've been desperately looking for.  The Greene farm, which appears to have escaped relatively unscathed from any and all of the unearthly menace we know as the zombie apocalypse; seems like a little slice of heaven.  Honey, I'm home!!  Heck they don't even post sentries, such trusting souls they are!Rick desperately wants his group to be accepted by the Greene clan so they can hopefully put an end to their travels by being able to set down roots on the farm.  However patriarch Hershel wants them all gone as soon as is feasibly possible.  Hershel expects the group to follow his rules while on his land.  As Rick starts to make positive progress with Hershel, of course, Shane has a tough time following those rules and soon Hershel's dark secret is known. Hershel's misguided faith and judgment, and how he wants thing done spells turmoil for Rick.  As Hershel doesn't see the rotlings as dead, but merely sick folks who at some point can be treated and get better, has Rick wrestling with what is the best course of action, when the decision is taken entirely out of his hands. The mid-season finale was a shocker.The power struggle between Rick and Shane reaches fevered pitch at times.  Rick would rather contemplate actions before implementing them, where Shane is a man of action, and sometimes it's reckless action.  You can darn near smell the testosterone as it hangs heavy in the air when these two go head to head.  The group wrestles with a huge moral dilemma when they come across rogue survivors. Are they no better than those they're trying to protect themselves from?Laurie is still her selfish and self absorbed self, (redundant, I know), allowing others to risk their safety in her behalf, while she seems to pass judgment on others in the group.... those who live in glass houses Laurie....I'm just sayin'.  Andrea becomes a force to be reckoned with as she learns to handle herself and a gun, and like Shane a bit reckless at times.  Carol has developed a bit of a spine.  Daryl is still AWESOME, using his tracking abilities to try and help locate their missing group member.  Glen finds a bit of happiness and takes risks that place him at odds with his new love interest Maggie.Carl seems to have become absolutely callused to this new world, and these human beings turned into the walking dead don't seem to faze him at all, to the point of him wandering into the woods and teasing and antagonizing a walker who's stuck in the mud, or actively encouraging his father to shoot someone the group feels is a threat to their safety.  Dale continues to try to be the voice of reason and poor T-Dog just kinda seems to be there in the background.  He's really not doing that much this season.  Hopefully that will change in season 3.We do lose some familiar faces this season, plus that beloved RV.... I LOVED that RV....

The technical violence developed against the very believable zombies is truly breath taking. The fox slaughter is wrenching, heads fly, are sliced down the middle before your eyes. No flinching here, body parts are hacked off, zombies stuck like pigs and knifed through the eyes and cranium. Some times the fox arms and legs show a little rubberiness, but usually look very real.

It's focus on pure survivalism was attractive for the masses because that animalistic instinct is all our world has left, in general and for consolation; our best solution for nihilism, itself birthed by liberalism, is to stare the devil in the face. That is a bitter pill. The show doesn't ever knowingly approach such insight, it just nicely imitated our mood.Darabont was fired for financial reasons, of course. Not surprisingly, the show then started to really suck. It is now preoccupied with moralizing wish-fulfillment and campy melodrama. The writing and acting we're both mediocre from the beginning, so real profundity should be off-limits. Now Dead is making proclamations about man, death and the Sacred, and its embarrassing to watch.All the characters undergo a developmental downward spiral, Daryl especially. Frankly, I was offended by their contrived innocence. There's all sorts of sudden, anomalous outbursts, many indirectly engineered by the pathetic plot and its impossible discrepancies. Others are resultant of the show's own liberal anxieties about unreconstructed white men. The 'love' between Glenn and the farm girl, which was so calculated, served no purpose besides blatant social-engineering. Yet, so is the character of Shane, who becomes so glaring so as to make the emotive, empathic old man and protagonist so much more purposeful. And so Is the entire situation surrounding and including Herschel, that old-time white man who couldn't possibly eat sushi.

They all end up killing each other with their own stupidity.  Why have people in your zombie fighting group who can't be trusted?  Then there is the backstory about stumbling zombies who apparently are able to move at a consistent 15 MPH.  Just have some zombie rules and follow them.  They're stumbling and they walk really slow, so follow that one freaking rule at least.  Show some consistency.  We find out that apparently everyone is a carrier and Rick held it from the group (seems like this would be really relevant given his wife is pregnant with a possible zombie baby).  The CDC guy informed them of this which is odd because he was following all the CDC protocol to avoid exposure to the disease.  Please don't try explaining it...it is just stupid.  Then some other group wants to take over their farm because apparently, there aren't enough empty farms to be found in the country during a zombie apocalypse, and it is necessary to take stuff from people.  Instead of hitting up Walmart for supplies they go into a town with lots of buildings and hit a tiny pharmacy that isn't very secure.  Their zombies are less intelligent than buffalo, and yet they can't figure out how to kill masses of them.

Nobody bothers with a silencer of any kind, and instead of using weapons like oh a baseball bat, a long machette, or a samurai sword, their weapons of choice are screwdrivers and knives that result in lots of blood getting sprayed all over them.

Then season two came out and the creators seemed to forget this was a horror show and made it a soap opera. They camped at the farm for the whole season and you had to wade through episode after episode of painful whining and dragged out emotional scenes like you would on a daytime soap. What saved the show from being a complete snooze was the last few episodes where things started to pick-up.Something snapped in the writers heads and they remembered that the zombies are the real stars of the show and they were brought back into the fold. So instead of an episode where they toss in the token zombie to wake up the viewers and remind us that a zombie apocalypse happened, the dead started springing up and became the driving force for the characters decision making.No spoilers here, but the final episode showed some promise and introduced a really eerie/cool looking character that perked my interest. So I will stick with the show and see how season three plays out. I really hope they drop some of the drama and make the characters actions and behaviors mimic how they would act in the aftermath of an extreme supernatural apocalypse. I'm sorry but watching Glenn after everything he has been through clam up like a whimpering little kid when a woman wants to kiss him just doesn't fly. If anything he should be saying, ""Give me some sugar baby!"" This is what made Shane's character so awesome, he had depth and you saw him transform into a person hell bent on survival, he realized the situation and tried to change to match the new way of life.The Walking Dead is worth watching. It does have some pitfalls (mainly American writers trying to plug family values and human emotion on a milquetoast level instead of making cutting edge terror/horror, something American Horror Story does well at), but the show does have a lot of potential and I think they ended season two on a positive note.

1493028,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B005LAJ22Q,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[15, 17]","Rick Grimes and his fellow survivors have escaped from Atlanta. Making for Fort Benning and the hope of rescue, the group is waylaid on the highway by a horde of walkers. With one of the group missing and another severely injured, they find a safe haven at a nearby farm and the hope of a new home. But as the days and weeks pass, the unresolved tensions in the group threaten to tear it apart.The second season of The Walking Dead picks up shortly after the events of the first. Whilst the first only had six episodes to tell its story, the second has thirteen, giving it more time to explore the premise and characters.Things get off to a strong start in the first few episodes, which focus on the confrontation on the highway and the attempts to bring the group back together. New characters - the Greene family - and a new location - a large farmstead - are introduced and events unfold with some vigour. However, after the third episode the story bogs down a little as characters start spinning their wheels at the farm. This is where the ramifications of a major pre-season production crisis - a budget cut that infuriated showrunner Frank Darabont and saw him leave the series - are at their most noticeable. Whilst the budget problems ground the series for a little too long at the farm, the producers do make the most of the money they do have. The zombie effects are a cut above the more variable effects of the first season and there are some truly gruesome moments that equal the most visceral scenes of any zombie movie that comes to mind.The long pause at the farm does allow some effective character development, particularly of Shane (Jon Bernthal), whose growing disillusionment with the group and his inability to accept the new status quo and move on is depicted quite well, even if the story does take a few too many episodes to come to a head. However, probably the best characterisation is left to Daryl (Norman Reedus), who evolves from the quieter brother of racist redneck Merle in the first season into a conflicted, complex character who refuses to fit easily into any stereotype. Rick (Andrew Lincoln), our main protagonist, gets a little lost in the mix this season with storylines focusing mostly on other characters, but comes back strong towards the end of the season as he starts to show signs of not handling the stress of command very well. However, his dynamic with Herschel (Scott Wilson) and the twists and turns it goes through is fascinating, with Herschel moving from a pacifistic man of faith to shotgun-wielding zombie-slayer under Rick's (not entirely laudable) influence. The introduction of Maggie (Lauren Cohan) as a love interest for Glenn (Steven Yeun) also adds a rare glimmer of sunlight to a dark season.Whilst the season does suffer from some slow pacing in its central section, it remains highly watchable, and the pacing issue is mitigated considerably on DVD without a week-long break between each episode. There are some effective moments of dark humour (the 'zombie well' scene is hilarious), the writing is pretty good and the actors mostly effective. Aside from the pacing issue, the character of Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) suffers the worst from inconsistent writing and motivations, which the actress does her best to make sense of but can't quite sell.Events culminate in a fairly epic two-part season finale in which the bubbling tensions within the group boil over and the biggest battle between the survivors and the zombies to date takes place. Despite some longeurs and niggling problems, Season 2 (****) ends on a high that leaves a lot of balls in the air for the third season and its promise of introducing some of the best characters and storylines from the comic book to the TV series. The series is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).",4,"An improvement over the first season, despite some pacing problems",1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,3835,"['Rick', 'Grimes', 'fellow', 'survivors', 'have', 'escaped', 'Atlanta', 'Making', 'Fort', 'Benning', 'hope', 'rescue', 'group', 'waylaid', 'highway', 'horde', 'walkers', 'one', 'group', 'missing', 'severely', 'injured', 'find', 'safe', 'haven', 'nearby', 'farm', 'hope', 'new', 'home', 'days', 'weeks', 'pass', 'unresolved', 'tensions', 'group', 'tear', 'apart.The', 'second', 'season', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'up', 'shortly', 'events', 'first', 'Whilst', 'first', 'only', 'had', 'six', 'episodes', 'tell', 'story', 'second', 'thirteen', 'giving', 'more', 'time', 'explore', 'premise', 'characters.Things', 'get', 'strong', 'start', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'focus', 'confrontation', 'highway', 'attempts', 'bring', 'group', 'back', 'together', 'New', 'characters', 'Greene', 'family', 'new', 'location', 'large', 'farmstead', 'are', 'introduced', 'events', 'unfold', 'vigour', 'However', 'third', 'episode', 'story', 'bogs', 'down', 'little', 'characters', 'start', 'spinning', 'wheels', 'farm', 'where', 'ramifications', 'major', 'pre-season', 'production', 'crisis', 'budget', 'cut', 'infuriated', 'showrunner', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'saw', 'leave', 'series', 'are', 'most', 'noticeable', 'Whilst', 'budget', 'problems', 'ground', 'series', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'farm', 'producers', 'do', 'make', 'most', 'money', 'do', 'have', 'zombie', 'effects', 'are', 'cut', 'more', 'variable', 'effects', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'truly', 'gruesome', 'moments', 'equal', 'most', 'visceral', 'scenes', 'zombie', 'movie', 'mind.The', 'long', 'pause', 'farm', 'allow', 'effective', 'character', 'development', 'particularly', 'Shane', 'Jon', 'Bernthal', 'growing', 'disillusionment', 'group', 'inability', 'accept', 'new', 'status', 'quo', 'move', 'depicted', 'quite', 'well', 'even', 'story', 'take', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'come', 'head', 'However', 'probably', 'best', 'characterisation', 'left', 'Daryl', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'who', 'quieter', 'brother', 'racist', 'redneck', 'Merle', 'first', 'season', 'conflicted', 'complex', 'character', 'who', 'fit', 'easily', 'stereotype', 'Rick', 'Andrew', 'Lincoln', 'main', 'protagonist', 'little', 'lost', 'mix', 'season', 'storylines', 'focusing', 'mostly', 'other', 'characters', 'back', 'strong', 'towards', 'end', 'season', 'show', 'signs', 'not', 'handling', 'stress', 'command', 'very', 'well', 'However', 'dynamic', 'Herschel', 'Scott', 'Wilson', 'twists', 'fascinating', 'Herschel', 'moving', 'pacifistic', 'man', 'faith', 'shotgun-wielding', 'zombie-slayer', 'Rick', 'not', 'entirely', 'laudable', 'influence', 'introduction', 'Maggie', 'Lauren', 'Cohan', 'love', 'interest', 'Glenn', 'Steven', 'Yeun', 'also', 'rare', 'glimmer', 'sunlight', 'dark', 'season.Whilst', 'season', 'suffer', 'slow', 'pacing', 'central', 'section', 'highly', 'watchable', 'pacing', 'issue', 'mitigated', 'considerably', 'DVD', 'week-long', 'break', 'episode', 'are', 'effective', 'moments', 'dark', 'humour', ""'zombie"", 'well', 'scene', 'hilarious', 'writing', 'pretty', 'good', 'actors', 'mostly', 'effective', 'Aside', 'pacing', 'issue', 'character', 'Lori', 'Sarah', 'Wayne', 'Callies', 'worst', 'inconsistent', 'writing', 'motivations', 'actress', 'best', 'make', 'sense', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sell.Events', 'culminate', 'fairly', 'epic', 'two-part', 'season', 'finale', 'bubbling', 'tensions', 'group', 'boil', 'biggest', 'battle', 'survivors', 'zombies', 'date', 'place', 'longeurs', 'niggling', 'problems', 'Season', '2', '****', 'high', 'lot', 'balls', 'air', 'third', 'season', 'promise', 'introducing', 'best', 'characters', 'storylines', 'comic', 'book', 'TV', 'series', 'series', 'available', 'now', 'UK', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'USA', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray']",N/A

1493050,A1KFWSYZIOBI3Y,B005LAJ22Q,"DaRRen ""Darren""","[10, 14]","This was a very good episode. Unlike other viewers, I would not classify the prior 3 or 4 weeks as ""slow."" This show -- like the comic books -- is not just about killing and dodging zombies. Instead, it is a complex television drama. So, if the characters are not slaughtering legions of zombies every week, I do not consider it a slow episode.  If the show were just about the zombies, it would not be rated as high as it is (I certainly would not watch it), and it would not have received such critical acclaim.The episode answers a lot of questions, including the location of Sophia, the missing girl. That story line drained a lot of time from the show, but it does provide for a very dramatic conclusion.Speaking of the conclusion, a lot of debates have taken place on Walking Dead fan pages about the appropriateness of Shane's behavior. Many fans of Shane say that his callousness and murderous zeal towards the zombies make him a stronger character. I encourage these individuals to reassess their evaluation by looking at the last moments of this episode. Although Shane claims to be a tough guy who could simply kill zombies ruthlessly, at the end of the show, he was paralyzed by painful emotions. Rick, on the other hand, was not. Throughout the series and in this episode in particular, Rick has managed to combine leadership with empathy, proving that one does not have to become blind to the suffering of others and place on layers of phony masculinity in order to survive.  Also, Shane's inability to move beyond Lori (they only had a brief affair), screams weakness.Aside from the brilliance of the episode, I have 2 small complaints. The first one, I have already written about. The gender roles on the show are bothersome to me. The women are subservient and ""emotional."" The men are stoic and leaders. Glenn's girlfriend continues to play a Sybil role. In the previous episode she picked a fight with Glenn and then suddenly kissed him. She did it again in this episode.Second, I am unhappy with the lack of use of T-Dog. At this point, his character is a mere token.

Fans of the comicbook series that the show is based on simply have to let go of the original narrative - the television producers made a clear decision to depart from the strict confines of the print version. Many characters are the same, and the overall zombie-plague scenario remains, but there are many significant changes. And changes for the better, I'd have to say. The comics are great, but so is this show, and I think the move to have the TV show be its own thing is fine -- the scripts are great, the drama is riveting, and the cast are taking ownership of the characters, giving them their own voices. The show is still character-driven, more about the moral crucible of disaster and how each person deals with the tensions between communal effort and individual survival, but the horror, when we see it, is also pretty freaky and intense.All in all, AMC's ""Walking Dead"" is an unqualified success, with the second season much stronger than the first, and the third season a must-see as well.

The core group of survivors, having escaped Atlanta and the destruction of the CDC, find refuge on the Greene family farm and there they sit for the bulk of the second season, as more than a few episodes go by and very little screen time given to encounters with flesh eating Walkers and a lot of time spent on personal issues, such as Lori's pregnancy, the search for Sophia, Glenn and Maggie's romance, ethical debates over what to do with Randall, Andrea's bad marksmanship,Darryl's brother issues and outsider status, and a lot of conversations about what to do next in the aftermath of the Zombie Apocalypse.But I think from the distance of two more additional seasons, the second act of THE WALKING DEAD looks much better in retrospect, if for no other reason than to enjoy the company of some major characters who are no longer around.  And to watch for themes that would take root and flower in later seasons.This second season truly belongs to Jon Bernthal's Shane Walsh, whose character arc from the first episode to the penultimate one is both tragic and horrifying.  Shane is a man being torn apart both emotionally and mentally; first for his love and devotion to Lori and Carl, the wife and son of his best friend, both of whom he saved and protected during the outbreak of the Zombie virus.  He is also torn over his life long friendship and love for Rick Grimes, Shane's fellow lawman and husband and father of Lori and Carl.  But worst of all, it is Shane who has come to realize just what it takes to survive in this terrible new world-something he learns the hard way in Save the Last One-but it is a truth he can't seem to make the others understand.That this is a world where there is no room for mercy or compassion is ultimately what drives Shane off the deep end, with tragic results for everyone, but in the seasons that have come after, it is clear that Shane was right and Rick was wrong in their debate over to proceed in the wake of the Zombie Apocalypse, starting with the fate of the scavenging Randall.  This is now a world where those who cling to the old values, like Dale and Hershel, are in for a very rude awakening, that is if they survive long enough.The slower pace of the second season did allow for some genuine character development as we get to know Glenn, Darryl, Andrea, Carol, Hershel Greene, his daughter Maggie, and Carl Grimes much better and in ways that would grow further in later seasons. Too bad the same can't be said of Sophia and Otis.  We also learn a lot about Sarah Wayne Callies's Lori Grimes, and most of it makes clear why she became one of the series most disliked characters.  Just look at her body language and facial expressions in By the Dying Fire when Rick confesses to her what happened to Shane or her babbling to Hershel after Carl is shot, to understand what I'm talking about.  Is she the only character to ever go out and wreck a car on an empty road?And for those who complained there wasn't enough Walker action, take a another look at the encounter with the herd on the highway in the season opener, What Lies Ahead; not to mention Shane and Otis's desperate fight with the Walker mob at the high school in Save the Last One; the shootout in Triggerfinger where Rick, Glenn and Hershel are trapped in the bar by the scavengers and the gunfire makes the Walkers come a running or the finale, By the Dying Fire, when the Walker onslaught over runs the Greene farm and there is a free for all for survival.There are the by now requisite big character deaths, but I've come to feel like they are a big cheat after we have come to care for and root for characters as they narrowly escape certain death.  Looking back, I think it would have been a better idea for Shane and Andrea to have left the farm like they discussed at one point and their characters would have been free to encounter Michonne and end up with the Governor at Woodbury, thus opening up a lot of interesting story possibilities.The acting is terrific all round, with a special nod to Andrew Linoln's Rick, whose character is changed by the end of the season in ways he did not anticipate, and old pro Scott Wilson as Hershel Greene, a man who thinks life will just find a way to go on in the face of a horrific new reality.  And Sarah Wayne Callies does a very good job with a very negative female character, which seems to be a staple on cable dramas-just ask Anna Gunn, who played Skylar White on BREAKING BAD.The DVD set, with its deleted scenes and episode commentary are well worth the price; and in a series with so many twists and turns, not to mention genuine loss, it's great having the set and being able to go back and savor what has come before.",5,"Yes, it was a long time on Hershel's farm, but...",1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2014,4916,"['second', 'season', 'THE', 'WALKING', 'DEAD', 'was', 'much', 'maligned',

I watched it on TV when it first came out and re-watched it at least 3 times on DVD.  Great, great season!  Now let me talk about how season 2 compares.  I don't think it has the same punch as season 1, because S1 was so surreal.  It introduced us to this doomsday land where hope is minimal.  It made us as viewers aware of a reality that cannot exist in our minds.  That's a big part of what made it so powerful.  But as season 2 is a continuation, how can it possibly reintroduce us to what we already know about the situation?  If it went on about how life became this way for the characters, it'd just be very repetitive.  Season 2 focus' on character development.  It introduces us further into the lives and minds of Rick & crew.  No, there aren't any epic Zombie apocalyptic scenes filmed in downtown Atlanta, we're passed that.  S2 is showing the characters finally being able to settle in, although not without a TON of drama.  I'm not going to spoil any scenes, but S2 has it's fair share of intense scenes.  Honestly I can't understand all the dissatisfaction from some fans of S1.Lastly I will add that I am NOT a follower of the comic series, which may have something to do with the negative reviews, i'm not sure.  But from someone who just enjoys the show for what it is, I will still say that Walking Dead is the best show on Cable and easily rivals anything on HBO & other ""premium"" channels.

I don't care who now since Rick chose to come back and rescue a man who is so apparent in his hate for him. So one of them needs to die already so the writers can stop using their tension as a crutch. On secoond thought, I want it to be Rick just for the simple fact that I don't buy his wide-eyed innocent view of the world any longer. Jesus Christ, it's one thing to try to save everyone and their cat but when it comes between you and a man who wants you dead so that he can replace you then what is the issue here? Where is the angst in making this decision? I don't care if it's your best friend from the 3rd grade. There are lines in life you don't let anyone cross post-apocolypse or not. Also, I don't think that the resolution of this conflict between Shane and Rick and Carol and Andrea is the big ticket item for this season. Don't get me wrong I think that this is going to happen, but I think the big surprise is going to be when Rick reveals what the doctor told him at the end of season 1. It probably has something to do with the two cop corpses they found that weren't bitten. So why don't they get on with it already and quit playing around.

The writers are on top of their game in Season 2 as our groups of survivors tries to out run the ""walking dead"" and find safety. The writers delve deeply into the moral issues facing the survivors. Nothing is simple and nothing is easy, yet there is an order in all the chaos if they can all stay together.Our groups leaves Atlanta looking for the safe haven they image has been created by the military. The ""walkers"" are everywhere and in one frightening attack, young Sophia runs off into the woods.Here is where the story begins to take a turn. Should the others risk their lives searching from someone who may already be dead? After a series of mishaps, the groups end up on the farm of Herschel and his daughters. Somehow his small band has been able to stay in place and survive. Now the power struggle begins between Hershel and Rick and Shane. There are some great thought provoking plot twists in season 2. Watch the season and see how the writers have incorporated so much drama into the series. For the survivors, the world as they knew it is gone. There is no longer a government to provide order and protections. It's every man for himself and can they survive.It was all the moral dilemmas that astounded me in this season. Are the ""walking dead"" still people who could be cured at some point? What if your loved one was a ""walking dead""? Is is right to risk more lives to possibly save one life? It was a random act of fate, that handfuls of people did not become part of the walking dead. It wasn't based on good or evil just chance. What happens when groups of survivors come into contact with each other?I just could not stop watching this series. Each episode is more intense and brings up more moral problems. New characters are added and established characters are lost to the zombies. How will it all end?There have been countless zombie movies and shows through the years. What exactly is a zombie and are they dead or living in another reality? This show could be another one of the silly zombie shows yet it is not. There is compassion in the hearts of people desperately hoping to survive and find the world they have lost. Inter-personal conflicts are real. How would any of us act under these circumstances.Shane becomes a major player in Season 2 as he goes deeper and deeper into some brewing madness. We see an evil side of Shane this season that is unnerving.Our group finally is not on the run for the time being. Hershel's farm is a refuge but there is an awful secret he is hiding. The show is simply amazing. If there is one weak spot in the plot, it's the constant movement of people into dangerous situations. If Carl disappears, Rick and Shane go looking for him.

1493086,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B005LAJ22Q,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[20, 29]","When former showrunner Frank Darabont ""left"" THE WALKING DEAD before the start of the second season, I was extremely worried for its future. It seemed to be going in a very positive direction after only a few episodes in its first season, and much of that seemed to be Darabont's passion for the project as well as creator Robert Kirkman's desire to not slavishly adhere to his own source material. That was a surprising high point for the first season, since the comic itself is so amazingly good, and has several fans, that he would be more than willing to depart from his own material in order to keep audiences on their toes.It was even rumored that a major cast member was ready to walk off set since Darabont's leaving, but who it was was never confirmed, and it certainly didn't happen.But when the show came back for its first episode of the second season, it made a point of adhering to certain major plot points of the comic while keeping the relationships and characters fresh, and with Glen Mazzara as the new showrunner, it seemed like the show was going to keep going along with all of the forward momentum it had gained from the previous season. However, I had some concerns about the bonafides of Mazzara. He had been an Exec Producer on several disappointing TV series, like ""Life"", ""Crash"" and ""HawthoRNe"", but he was also an exec on one of the best cop shows ever, ""The Shield"". So, with any work on ""The Shield"" cancelling any of the poorer parts of his career out, it was looking like smooth scary sailing for this season.Now, it's worth pointing out that THE WALKING DEAD has easily become the most contentious piece of genre television since SyFy's reboot of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. If you look at the internet after an episode, it's aflutter with conversations proclaiming it either one of the worst shows ever or one of the best shows ever. It's also worth mentioning that neither side is right. When an episode of TWD is good, it ranks amongst some of the very best TV has to offer. Episodes like ""Chupacabra"" where Daryl is stranded in the wilderness, ""Pretty Much Dead Already"" when the group opens the barn, and ""Better Angels"" as Shane enacts some of his solutions to some of his problems are some of the best episodes of TV in recent memory. But further more, there is another group of viewers that sound off even more frequently than either other group: The ""I'm Watching Because I Want It To Get Better"" group. This is the group with the most complaints, and in my opinion, the ones with the most validity to their claims. They want the show to have tighter writing. They want the characters not to be glossed over. They don't want too many 'Red Shirts' on the show (referring of course to the old ""Star Trek"" and how the nameless characters existed merely to get killed in an episode). They want the show to keep moving. There are moments that I agree with all of these statements, but I'm seeing what the show is doing (or trying to do) and am much more willing to forgive the show's occasional plot hole or deus ex machina or the ""This Character is About to Do Something REALLY Stupid"" moments in favor of the work being done by the cast, crew and creative staff.However, it's far from perfect when plot and characters start to get bogged down from over-expository moments to a particular episode. Characters like Lori, Dale, Carol and ESPECIALLY T-Dog are essentially lost in the character arc shuffle despite the major things happen (Carol and Sophia, Lori and The Surprise, Dale and his staunch sense of humanity, and T-Dog and his... well... he did have that arm injury... yes, I'm essentially calling T-Dog a useless character bordering on being the ""Token Black Stereotype""). However, when there are moments of their arcs moving forward, they do so with tremendous momentum.But even with Rick struggling to lead the group as a paragon of virtue, Andrea overcoming her personal demons and becoming a strong element to the group's assault force, Carl spending formative moments in the midst of far too many moral grey areas for a child to have to experience, the new character of Herschel and his staunch religious and moral beliefs and then having those beliefs shattered, and Glenn and his discovery of his more masculine side with the help of new character Maggie... this season belonged to one character: Shane. If there is a character that we can identify with the most AND the least, it's Shane. Here's a man willing to do anything to keep himself safe as well as the woman and child he loves. He also is willing to commit to an almost morally bankrupt existence so that he can do those things. Jon Bernthal proves to be the most versatile cast member for this season, and his arc is the most compelling. If Bernthal doesn't get an Emmy nod for his work on this season, it honestly won't make sense.Speaking of the cast, there are several who shine: Jeffrey DeMunn as the ever-watchful ever-wise Dale, Laurie Holden as the struggling-to-find-her-place Andrea, Steven Yeun as the occasionally-wisecracking and romantically-challenged Glenn, Andrew Lincoln as the constantly-conflicted Rick, but the other two strongest performances besides Bernthal are Scott Wilson as Herschel and Norman Reedus as Daryl Dixon. Sadly, the weakest link to the cast is Sarah Wayne Callies as Lori. She didn't impress during her run on the show PRISON BREAK, and just seems too far out of her depth since most of her scenes are with other, better performances. Also sad are the criticisms of Chandler Riggs playing young Carl. He's actually not out of his depth here, and his character is that of a young boy who is trying to maintain some of his youthful nature despite the omnipresent death that looms around him in either physical or metaphysical form. He's reckless, impatient, irresponsible, and sometimes flat-out dumb. But surprisingly, most kids that age are like that, and I don't think that the character or the young actor deserves the criticism he gets.From a technical standpoint, the effects work on the show is flawless. Greg Nicotero, who also transitioned into directing during this season, has supervised all the VFX and makeup and has done so with an expert eye for detail, even if some of that detail is EXTREMELY gory. Other directors like Ernest Dickerson, who's directed several episodes of this show, as well as many other shows such as BURN NOTICE, DEXTER, TREME, and most especially THE WIRE (not arguably the greatest cop show ever to hit television), shows a great eye for striking visuals as well as being a very good actor's director, which was especially proven in his direction of the season finale, ""Beside The Dying Fire"". Other strong creative forces kept proving themselves time and again this season, such as writer/co-producer Evan Reilly, who came from another favorite show of mine, RESCUE ME, and Kirkman himself who did his share of heavy lifting in the writing and exec producing this season, despite being the writer of at least three monthly comic books as well.The only problem I have with the show consistently is the same problem I have with all action or genre-oriented entertainment: The unerring shootist or unlimited ammo UNLESS the moment requires them to run out of ammo, or miss to create tension or suspense. You see, characters walk around this show like Wild Bill Hickok in a John Woo film. Sure, there were moments when Shane and Rick taught the members of the group how to shoot, but BELIEVE ME, you still can't shoot a zombie in the head hanging out of a moving car no matter how many months you might have been practicing, and you can't fire 20-odd rounds of a 7-round shotgun. The only time the people miss or run out of ammo is when the story requires it, like reloading with a Walker creeping up behind you, or just grazing the skull of a fellow group member when if it had been a Walker, it would be a completely perfect headshot.The most common complaint I hear about this show is the lack of Walkers. That is one of those complaints that I dismiss entirely out of hand. You want constant zombie presence and constant zombie killing, watch the RESIDENT EVIL films. THE WALKING DEAD is not just a zombie show, much in the same way that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA wasn't just a space-battle show. The characters have to interact and grow, especially in an environment such as this where society no longer exists other than in their own memories. Morality is something that appears to be the relic of a bygone era, and this is a land that seems to be ruled strictly by Darwinian principles. Concepts of good and evil have become luxuries, and the new law is survival. Some members of this group believe that very strongly, and some are shouting to the heavens that there must be a better way to live other than just survival. The argument could honestly be made either way, and more often than not, those are the moments when the show can either be at its best or it can wither away any momentum it had. The show is already great, but finding a balance between words and deeds will be how the show will live or die, but there are far too many smart and talented people behind this program for that to happen. The show has only had 19 episodes. Young shows will have growing pains, but when I rewatched the season finale, there were too many things that showed even more promise for the new season.",5,"The most divisive show in years, and it's

I'm just not getting the same feeling from the show that had me rabidly waiting for the next episode last season.

I have no problem with this season.  The first season they were meeting each other and trying to find a safe place to stay.  Now that they have, things (though still dangerous) are as good at the time as they can have it.  They are making the best of what they can.  Plus, after all they have been and are going through, I guess they would be a bit dramatic.  How can you expect humans to deal with the things they are?  The end of the world, the end of most of the human race, a new unknown enemy with no brains just a lust to kill and eat them.  I like this season.  It keeps me on the edge of my seat, well the edge of my bed.  You can not expect action 100% of the time.  It's like life.  You get a little bit of everything.

After the first season's initial 6 episode trial run, the fandom was enormous! AMC heard the calls and grabbed the show for a 2nd season. The shows following is at a level of Star Trek or Star Wars in their own right. Trying to remain true to the graphic novel, Robert Kirkman has allowed the producers to make their own added material that is TV oriented. The pair is a match made in heaven!I should first say that ALL 3 SETS OF BLU-RAYS, have arrived to me as promised. As advertised and earlier than expected! Thanks to the professionalism at Amazon, working the holiday rush was a challenge, but my product was not only before time, it was packaged well and I could see that care was taken to be sure that my sets arrived together. Sorting facilities from 2 locations. 5 Stars all the way!As for this amazing and ground breaking series, we see a group of people from diverse backgrounds band together for a common cause. Survival. Ordinary people become soldiers. Become warriors then killers as needed. It really is on a literal level, kill or be killed or be eaten. Worse yet, become the Undead! We see the progression, or digression or people to either step up and become leaders or ego maniacs. When the world falls away, law and order are things of the past, we mutate back to primal behaviors. Even those who are leaders, lead by brutality when needed. The maniacal grow into Hitleristic shells of ""their way or no way."" All live by the weapon. Hand to hand combat does not work in a world where a hand away means a hand bitten.This is brutal. Absolutely sadistic at times. Compassion is fleeting but very much welcome for the cherished moments they arrive. And as soon as that tender moment might come, death rears its ugly head. The living are, at times, more fearsome than the Undead. Thus far, the Governor has been the most Demonic. Merle was close, but just in it for the kicks. I think Shane was as Dale described, ""Made for this world.""Even now, as season 3 ended, Rick is questionable in his mental stability. Can he really be a ""farmer Brown?"" No more the leader? Hmm... So far the head count has shuffled much. Those we hated at first are fan favs' now. Hey, they've earned it. Of course, we have seen up to Season 4 mid-season finale'. I really hate those!

It got bogged down in a lot of feelings (and that criticism is fair because sure I expected a certain amount of expressed emotion in a series this real and horrible (in situations, certainly not in storyline, etc.). But whole episodes devoted to emotions and relationships, here is where the Dead teetered on getting soapy and after the stellar Season 1, it was a stark contrast.However, fear not! Somewhere around Episode 9 (Triggerfinger) and 11 (Judge, Jury, and Executioner) it found its original excitement and energy and got back on track. As I always do when reviewing shows like The Walking Dead,  I encourage you not to allow those under the age of 16 to watch it. There is a great deal of blood and gore (not for the sake of sensationalism, it lends to the reality of the situation of living under the constant threat of the ""zombie virus"" which has, in season 2, begun to sink in as reality for the characters as well). For people particularly sensitive to this type of action, well, I admit The Dead is not for everyone (I actually am not particularly fond of it myself). But the scenes are not done to pull in boys under 17. It is a full -fledged adult drama that I would put up against nearly anything offered at the movie theaters (in my opinion, in league with Homeland and Sons of Anarchy).I know money is tight now - which I am repeating in my reviews of all seasons of Dead - and I would not push a show I didn't think was worthy of spending it on. And DO yourself a favor and buy the blu-ray version. I'm actually going to add all three seasons to my Wish List on here. It would make great Christmas gifts for people like me who have watched it from the beginning, but also those you know who keep saying they'd love to pick it up but are too busy. It's the best of the best and I highly recommend Season's 1 and 2. For Season 3, go read that review.

The imminent danger and terror were palpable at every moment, perfectly conveying that mood of terror and desolation. The herd scene was very intense and almost difficult to watch as i felt so drawn it, it was like i was there with them, being scared to death that one of the walkers might bend down, see them and take a bite. It was pure terror. I like how the episodes (Season 1 until now) go from delightfully scary to unexpectedly terrifying about half-way through. The scene where Andrea is still in the RV playing with her gun when the walkers are right outside and the little delay until she discovers them but it is too late and she is trapped inside: perfection. So intense. I was dying watching her locked up in the small restroom and the walker right outside. If only all episodes in this season were like that.What did bother me was all the men deciding that the little women shouldnt get any guns in a world overrun by zombies and where a walker seems to be waiting at every turn. That was ridiculous and pretty sexist and short sighted. I also couldnt believe that the kids were allowed to just roam around as they pleased and how Carl was allowed to go on the search for Sophia; in fact that entire scene where he asks for permission and Lori gets all ""cutsie"" about it  - as if she was debating whether she should let him go camping tonight and not as if she was juts about ot send her 10 year old into the woods filled with zombies - seemed ridiculous.I did like how Andrea eventually confronted Dale and accused him of having taken away her choice to die on her terms as opposed to being torn apart by drooling freaks. I had never thought about it that way but given their predicament it did make sense and as the audience it does make you wonder what you would choose if the world had come to an end and being scared and the race to stay alive where the only things to live for. Suddenly Dale stopped looking like a hero who saved her life. It was acted very believably because you see that moment of epiphany in Dale's face where it occurs to him for the first time that what he did wasnt selfless deserving gratitude, but in fact quite selfish. That is the kind of strong dialog and exchange I expect to see throughout this season.Altogether I think this was one bada$$ episode from start to finish and I am so disappointed that the subsequent episodes of this season have failed in that regard and that we have gone essentially from a fantastic season premiere filled with all the amazing elements that made Season 1 excel to one that looks like an empty balloon you let all the air out of and that is sort of just sitting around deflated. This is how I see the subsequent episodes anyway - especially compared to Season 1 and the Season 2 premiere.

It's a terrible series if you value intelligent, thought-provoking dialogue and characters that don't stretch the boundaries of believability time and time again until you find yourself shouting at the zombie, ""Eat her already, I'm tired of her whining. And while you're all at it, pick up that holier than thou sheriff and his wife too would you????"" I really did try to dislike this series on that basis alone, really I did since I found the characters annoying and incredibly stupid in ways that defy even the most basic logic. For instance, Season 2 opens with our band of heroes (such as they are) stranded on an open highway. Now, they've been dealing with the walking undead for an entire season already. They should know this is a very, very bad situation. And yet, they wander around poking into vehicles while talking loudly acting as if it's just another Sunday afternoon at the park. When the zombies show up, as they do (they ALWAYS do) our little band is woefully unprepared for them. YET AGAIN. What happens from there could be called a comedy of errors, but I didn't find myself laughing. Instead, I kept reaching for the off button finding myself increasingly irritated and annoyed with the lot of them. But, like a train wreck or that bad auto accident that one passes on the freeway I found myself unable to look away. So I kept watching. I have to say as zombie shows go this one rocks, the walking undead are fascinating characters all by themselves, to heck with the human survivors. And who doesn't enjoy a good zombie show just for the vicarious thrill of seeing some undead former person slowly and implacably snarling and lunging forward determined to do one thing and one thing only, snack on living flesh! And oh the joy of screaming, ""Run already you idiots!"" as you get that first glimpse of a band of zombies around the corner knowing that the people are going to blunder right into the middle of them.Besides I love a good survive against all odds TV show or movie even if I do tell myself time and time again, ""I would so rock that situation since I'm way smarter than any of these people."" And then I realize that part of the point of this series is that no, maybe I wouldn't be that smart. I might just do as many dumb, clueless things as its characters do. Why? Because they are human after all, ordinary people that may have been nice enough folks as you passed them on your way to a Sunday afternoon barbecue back when the world was normal. And yet, just like you they find themselves woefully, stupidly unprepared to survive in this new human eat human world. So do what I did if you're watching this series. Grab a good pillow or blankie to hold up to your face during the grosser moments, make peace with the fact that the human survivors are going to do dumb things repeatedly and cheer like mad for them and the zombies and place your bets on who wins with your friends. The one thing this show isn't is dull and boring and predictable. EVER. And in the end that's what makes this a great series after all in spite of its flaws. The fresh and the unexpected will draw you back time and time again.  Heck, right now I'm so hooked I have to admit I'd actually watch reality TV if it had zombies in it. ""Snookie, drop that dress and run. There's a zombie shuffling up the aisle straight towards you!"" So yeah, even though I keep telling myself I won't watch Season 3 when it comes out the sad truth is I probably will, at least until or if it gets boring and predictable.Let's face it folks, The Walking Dead is one of life's guilty pleasures.",4,You Know You Should Look Away But...,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,3742,"['great', 'little', 'series', 'IF', 'love', 'getting', 'crap', 'scared', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'are', 'tired', 'shows', 'always', 'end', 'happy', 'fuzzy', 'note', 'terrible', 'series', 'value', 'intelligent', 'thought-provoking', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'stretch', 'boundaries', 'believability', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'find', 'shouting', 'zombie', 'Eat', 'already', ""'m"", 'tired', 'whining', ""'re"", 'pick', 'up', 'holier', 'thou', 'sheriff', 'wife', 'too', 'would', 'really', 'did', 'try', 'dislike', 'series', 'basis', 'alone', 'really', 'did', 'found', 'characters', 'annoying', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'ways', 'defy', 'even', 'most', 'basic', 'logic', 'instance', 'Season', '2', 'opens', 'band', 'heroes', 'such', 'are', 'stranded', 'open', 'highway', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dealing', 'walking', 'undead', 'entire', 'season', 'already', 'should', 'know', 'very', 'very', 'bad', 'situation', 'yet', 'wander', 'poking', 'vehicles', 'talking', 'loudly', 'acting', 'just', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'park', 'When', 'zombies', 'show', 'up', 'do', 'ALWAYS', 'do', 'little', 'band', 'woefully', 'unprepared', 'YET', 'AGAIN', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'comedy', 'errors', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'myself', 'laughing', 'Instead', 'kept', 'reaching', 'off', 'button', 'finding', 'increasingly', 'irritated', 'annoyed', 'lot', 'train', 'wreck', 'bad', 'auto', 'accident', 'one', 'freeway', 'found', 'unable', 'look', 'away', 'kept', 'watching', 'have', 'say', 'zombie', 'go', 'one', 'rocks', 'walking', 'undead', 'are', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'heck', 'human', 'survivors', 'who', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'good', 'zombie', 'show', 'just', 'vicarious', 'thrill', 'seeing', 'undead', 'former', 'person', 'slowly', 'implacably', 'snarling', 'lunging', 'forward', 'determined', 'do', 'one', 'thing', 'one', 'thing', 'only', 'snack', 'living', 'flesh', 'joy', 'screaming', 'Run', 'already', 'idiots', 'get', 'first', 'glimpse', 'band', 'zombies', 'corner', 'knowing', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'blunder', 'right', 'middle', 'them.Besides', 'love', 'good', 'survive', 'odds', 'TV', 'show', 'movie', 'even', 'do', 'tell', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'would', 'so', 'rock', 'situation', ""'m"", 'way', 'smarter', 'people', 'then', 'realize', 'part', 'point', 'series', 'maybe', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'smart', 'might', 'just', 'do', 'as', 'many', 'dumb', 'clueless', 'things', 'characters', 'do', 'Why', 'are', 'human', 'ordinary', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'enough', 'folks', 'passed', 'way', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'barbecue', 'back', 'when', 'world', 'was', 'normal', 'yet', 'just', 'find', 'woefully', 'stupidly', 'unprepared', 'survive', 'new', 'human', 'eat', 'human', 'world', 'So', 'do', 'what', 'did', ""'re"", 'watching', 'series', 'Grab', 'good', 'pillow', 'blankie', 'hold', 'up', 'face', 'grosser', 'moments', 'make', 'peace', 'fact', 'human', 'survivors', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'dumb', 'things', 'repeatedly', 'cheer', 'mad', 'zombies', 'place', 'bets', 'who', 'friends', 'one', 'thing', 'show', ""n't"", 'dull', 'boring', 'predictable', 'EVER', 'end', 'what', 'great', 'series', 'spite', 'flaws', 'fresh', 'unexpected', 'will', 'draw', 'back', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'Heck', 'right', 'now', ""'m"", 'so', 'hooked', 'have', 'admit', ""'d"", 'actually', 'watch', 'reality', 'TV', 'had', 'zombies', 'Snookie', 'drop', 'dress', 'run', 'zombie', 'shuffling', 'up', 'aisle', 'straight', 'towards', 'So', 'yeah', 'even', 'keep', 'telling', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Season', '3', 'when', 'out', 'sad', 'truth', 'probably', 'will', 'least', 'boring', 'predictable.Let', 'face', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'one', 'life', 'guilty', 'pleasures']",N/A

Now flip the show 180 degrees and have a show that's paced too quickly, all the characters are great and likable and non-stop action because hey who needs a plot. Get my point, no matter what the producers of this show do, they're not going to make everyone 100% happy all the time. To completely disregard the behind the scenes drama that took place in the production offices of the show would be disingenous. Realistically one or more actors left the show because of this drama, ultimately leading into storylines that may not have been but the one thing I have to say about the production is that it never lacked. Throughout this season I felt immersed within this world during the 40 minutes that this show was on weekly. As the characters were devestated by what was unfolding before them so was I and to me this is the benchmark of good storytellng in film, movie or any other artform that chooses to tell a story in the traditional sense.

1493130,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005LAJ22Q,Mark Turner,"[4, 5]","Yes it's true, the best drama on TV these days features zombies. The second season of THE WALKING DEAD arrives this week on DVD and this is one series that not only keeps getting better but stays original and draws viewers in at a steady even pace.If you missed the first season the apocalypse has come upon the Earth not in the form of war but in a virus that has brought the dead back to life with an unquenchable thirst for blood. As they attack the living each new victim becomes another member of the walking dead, hungry as those who turned them.Into this world we saw Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) wake from a coma (he was a sheriff wounded in the line of duty) to an empty hospital. He struggled but found his way home to discover his wife and son were there no more and he set off in search of them, eventually reuniting with them and unaware that thinking he was dead his wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) had taken up with his best friend Shane (Jon Bernthall). With a ragtag group of allies they headed to the CDC only do discover one last survivor there who then blew up the facility at the close of that season.Season two begins with the group on the road once more heading towards Ft. Benning. When they get stuck in a traffic jam on the highway and their RV breaks down, they look for replacement parts only to have a herd of zombies head their way. For the most part they do well but two leftover zombies spot young Sophia and she heads into the woods. Rick follows, finds her and directs her back to the group while he distracts the zombies and then kills them. When he returns Sophia is no where to be found and the group spends their time searching for her. At the end of the first episode while they search, Rick's son Carl is shot by a stray hunter's bullet.Episode two gets us to the place where the hunter lives, a farm with its own group of survivors led by the farm's owner Hershel (Scott Wilson). A veterinarian, he saves Carl and the rest of the group is brought to the farm as well. The search for Sophia continues and for the better half of the first season this is the focal point. It's what happens to the group during this search and after that brings forth the drama in the series.The group changes as the show progresses. Secrets between various members are brought to light. Control of the group becomes a catalyst that drives wedges between these people. And slowly we begin to see Shane lose his mind. It's a slow burn that we watch progress from episode to episode that culminates with one of the most stunning solutions every shot in a series. This, along with the search and discovery of Sophia, makes for some stirring moments.That may be the plotline that the story follows this season but it's the interaction between characters that make this series tick. Forget the fact that zombies are all around, the interplay between these survivors is what brings the story to life. The zombies take far less screen time then one would expect with a title like this. A true gathering doesn't even occur until the last two episodes.Instead we have the drama played out by the love triangle involved with Rick, Lori and Shane. We have the development and maturing of young Carl in a world where there is no room for childhood. There is the fatherly affection between the older Dale and the emotionally scarred Andrea who begins to change as well. And in the midst of it all is Hershel and his family, thinking that there is still hope for a world to return to the way it was, secluded from the horror that has spun out of control in the world.There are dramas on TV right now that have nothing on this series. As I said, if you took away the zombies the drama would still be the centerpiece and hold your attention. I considered if it would work in another format, say alien invasion or perhaps a world war on U.S. soil ala RED DAWN. In each format I choose the stories hold up. Zombies just add a touch of uneasiness to the mix.The acting on view here is tremendous. There are no stand outs as every person involved brings their A game to the screen. From children to wizened aging actors, each does a fantastic job of bringing their character to life. There isn't a sympathetic character on view here, from the supposed bad guys to the amazingly good guys. And there are two things to know about every character here. One, they can change in the flick of an eye from good to bad and two, not everyone is going to make it. During one of the special extras sequences the statement is made that everyone comes to work wondering if their character will remain or not.Words can not describe how amazing this series is. There were moments during season two where my jaw literally dropped and I had to pause the disc to absorb what just transpired. This is not just a DVD that you will want to rent; it is one worth having on the shelf.  The only bad thing is having to wait until October for season three to begin.",5,TV'S BEST DRAMA HAS ZOMBIES?,1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,4940,"['Yes', 'true', 'best', 'drama', 'TV', 'days', 'features', 'zombies', 'second', 'season', 'THE', 'WALKING', 'DEAD', 'week', 'DVD', 'one', 'series', 'not', 'only', 'getting', 'better', 'original', 'draws', 'viewers', 'steady', 'even', 'pace.If', 'missed', 'first', 'season', 'apocalypse', 'come', 'Earth', 'not', 'form', 'war', 'virus', 'brought', 'dead', 'back', 'life', 'unquenchable', 'thirst', 'blood', 'attack', 'living', 'new', 'victim', 'member', 'walking', 'dead', 'hungry', 'who', 'turned', 'world', 'saw', 'Rick', 'Grimes', 'Andrew', 'Lincoln', 'wake', 'coma', 'was', 'sheriff', 'wounded', 'line', 'duty', 'empty', 'hospital', 'struggled', 'found', 'way', 'home', 'discover', 'wife', 'son', 'were', 'there', 'no', 'more', 'set', 'off', 'search', 'eventually', 'reuniting', 'unaware', 'thinking', 'was', 'dead', 'wife', 'Lori', 'Sarah', 'Wayne', 'Callies', 'had', 'taken', 'up', 'best', 'friend', 'Shane', 'Jon', 'Bernthall', 'ragtag', 'group', 'allies', 'headed', 'CDC', 'only', 'do', 'discover', 'one', 'last', 'survivor', 'who', 'then', 'blew', 'up', 'facility', 'close', 'season.Season', 'two', 'group', 'road', 'once', 'more', 'heading', 'towards', 'Ft.', 'Benning', 'When', 'get', 'stuck', 'traffic', 'jam', 'highway', 'RV', 'down', 'look', 'replacement', 'parts', 'only', 'have', 'herd', 'zombies', 'head', 'way', 'most', 'part', 'do', 'well', 'two', 'leftover', 'zombies', 'spot', 'young', 'Sophia', 'woods', 'Rick', 'back', 'group', 'zombies', 'then', 'kills', 'When', 'Sophia', 'where', 'be', 'found', 'group', 'time', 'searching', 'end', 'first', 'episode', 'search', 'Rick', 'son', 'Carl', 'shot', 'stray', 'hunter', 'bullet.Episode', 'two', 'place', 'where', 'hunter', 'farm', 'own', 'group', 'survivors', 'led', 'farm', 'owner', 'Hershel', 'Scott', 'Wilson', 'veterinarian', 'Carl', 'rest', 'group', 'brought', 'farm', 'as', 'well', 'search', 'Sophia', 'better', 'half', 'first', 'season', 'focal', 'point', 'what', 'group', 'search', 'drama', 'series.The', 'group', 'changes', 'show', 'Secrets', 'various', 'members', 'are', 'brought', 'light', 'Control', 'group', 'catalyst', 'wedges', 'people', 'slowly', 'begin', 'see', 'Shane', 'lose', 'mind', 'slow', 'burn', 'watch', 'progress', 'episode', 'episode', 'one', 'most', 'stunning', 'solutions', 'shot', 'series', 'search', 'discovery', 'Sophia', 'stirring', 'moments.That', 'may', 'be', 'plotline', 'story', 'season', 'interaction', 'characters', 'make', 'series', 'tick', 'Forget', 'fact', 'zombies', 'are', 'interplay', 'survivors', 'story', 'life', 'zombies', 'take', 'far', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'then', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'title', 'true', 'gathering', ""n't"", 'even', 'occur', 'last', 'two', 'episodes.Instead', 'have', 'drama', 'played', 'out', 'love', 'triangle', 'involved', 'Rick', 'Lori', 'Shane', 'have', 'development', 'maturing', 'young', 'Carl', 'world', 'where', 'room', 'childhood', 'fatherly', 'affection', 'older', 'Dale', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'Andrea', 'who', 'change', 'as', 'well', 'midst', 'Hershel', 'family', 'thinking', 'still', 'hope', 'world', 'return', 'way', 'was', 'secluded', 'horror', 'spun', 'control', 'are', 'dramas', 'TV', 'right', 'now', 'have', 'nothing', 'series', 'said', 'took', 'away', 'zombies', 'drama', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'centerpiece', 'hold', 'attention', 'considered', 'would', 'work', 'format', 'say', 'alien', 'invasion', 'perhaps', 'world', 'war', 'U.S.', 'soil', 'ala', 'RED', 'DAWN', 'format', 'choose', 'stories', 'hold', 'up', 'Zombies', 'just', 'add', 'touch', 'uneasiness', 'mix.The', 'acting', 'view', 'here', 'tremendous', 'are', 'stand', 'person', 'involved', 'game', 'screen', 'children', 'wizened', 'aging', 'actors', 'fantastic', 'job', 'bringing', 'character', 'life', ""n't"", 'sympathetic', 'character', 'view', 'here', 'supposed', 'bad', 'guys', 'amazingly', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'know', 'character', 'here', 'One', 'can', 'change', 'flick', 'eye', 'good', 'bad', 'two', 'not', 'everyone', 'going', 'make', 'one', 'special', 'extras', 'statement', 'made', 'everyone', 'work', 'wondering', 'character', 'will', 'remain', 'not.Words', 'can', 'not', 'describe', 'how', 'amazing', 'series', 'were', 'moments', 'season', 'two', 'where', 'jaw', 'literally', 'dropped', 'had', 'pause', 'disc', 'absorb', 'what', 'just', 'transpired', 'not', 'just', 'DVD', 'will', 'want', 'rent', 'one', 'worth', 'having', 'shelf', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'having', 'wait', 'October', 'season', 'three', 'begin']",N/A

1493138,A8YJ32NRV39I6,B005LAJ22Q,M. George,"[1, 1]","Walking Dead has been hugely popular in the comic scene for awhile now, yet the introduction of this AMC show skyrocketed the whole franchise into fame and notability among not just the 'nerdy' markets yet the TV market itself. This surge of popularity has given the franchise an amazing amount of room to branch out to video games, novels, collectibles, etc. So the second season of the TV show was bound to have a lavish collectors edition, and while it isn't a letdown, there are some annoying drawbacks.For start, the ""head-case"" is pretty cool. It does come from a pretty iconic scene exclusive to the second season of the Walking Dead. The blu-ray discs fit perfectly inside, and the opening/closing mechanism seems pretty solid, yet I keep them with the other blu-ray discs because I see no reason to hide them inside the head. The detail of head seems similar to a high quality Halloween mask up-close, yet looks fantastic from a distance away, and I also love the big title-words underneath the head. Overall, it looks really awesome on a shelf, I have mine on my shelf dedicated to Walking Dead where it holds all my books, issues, and blu-rays of the franchise.The season itself is pretty awesome, I've found that most readers of the book wish it stuck closer to the book and went through these events much faster. (For comparison, the first two season of this show only cover the first twelve issues of the book, and each issue is very short.) Yet I find the second season to be a more dramatic, realistic, and character driven version of the book. There's more time for each character, and more pacing for each event. There's still certainly some issues with the show, most notably two of the characters are jaw-droppingly more stupid in the show, and some other characters are seemingly not in the show.The video and audio quality is terrific. Due to the nature of the show, there's a very gritty look with plenty of film grain, yet it all looks great. There's a general lack of a soundtrack, so there's plenty of time to notice all the immersive background sounds, most notably a very subtle effect of a horde of zombies moaning into a collective disturbing feeling that is used numerous times. While the more intense sounds of gunshots and yelling all stay crisp and clear.This release is spread along four blu-rays, so it's obvious there's a very decent amount of extras here. Yet, the first season had at least one audio commentary on each episode, while this one only has audio commentary on five of the thirteen episodes (and the 20 minute collection of the webisodes). The rest of the special features are pretty awesome, a huge amount of behind the scene and interview featurettes which each clock in around seven minutes.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[4, 5]","In all fairness, I must admit that, with certain exceptions, I am not a fan of horror movies or television series.I am even less a fan of the ""zombie"" movie.  Frankly, I think they are silly.  [Sorry, George Romero.]On the other hand, I love a well-written, intelligent script...even if it is in the horror genre.  Good writing is good writing, no matter where you find it.THE WALKING DEAD may have been adapted from a series of graphic novels by Robert Kirkman, and there are plenty of zombies walking around and feasting in the thirteen-episode second season, but these decaying creatures take a back seat to the compelling human dramas that are played out between the survivors.Because we, as an audience, come to care about these multi-dimensional characters, several of whom do not survive the season, when the zombies (aka: ""walkers"") do attack they are anything but ""silly"".  They are truly frightening.Viewers who enjoy blood, guts and gore will not be disappointed, but unlike most zombie movies, that's not what this series is about.  In THE WALKING DEAD, story and character trump visceral delights.I am not going to give specific plot details, except to say that this season not only finds the survivors taking refuge on a remote farm, populated by a veterinarian (Scott Wilson), his daughters and some neighbors, but there is also a deadly insurrection brewing within the core group.All of the performances in the show are superb, as are the Georgia-filmed series' visual effects, make-up and other elements.  This is a first-rate production.My chief concern about the program's future is: How long can the creators successfully continue the basic premise without resolving it?Most shows of this ilk (i.e. ones with one continuing story line) run out of steam after a season or two and are better suited as ""limited series.""  Hopefully, the producers will not allow this excellent series to overstay its welcome.The four-disc DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes many extras, ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes, webisodes and deleted scenes.

Many viewers often talked about the stretching out of certain subplots, but I feel its all about timing. Consider that the TV series airs with mid-season breaks and small cliffhangers certain events need to play out. Plus I feel its for added drama effect. Only then will you understand that the timing makes sense and justifiable (I won't want to reveal spoilers even with season two long over). Timing in a tv series is all about impact to the viewer and this series excels at it. The ending to this season leaves you begging for a quick return to season three.In season one I noticed a lot of ""film grain"" or noise if you will. I accepted it and thought it added to the setting and tone of the series. This seasons transfer onto blu-ray is still great and perhaps better than season one. While some other HD shows either use ""better"" cameras (such as Game of Thrones) the picture still remains plenty sharp. I'd rate the surround sound about the same as I would picture quality.Extra's finally add the webisodes with its story telling shifting to a background character from the first season. Its worth a watch. I do wish since this was the blu-ray that the webisode could not show the AMC logo. The minidocuments are all entertaining but like most extra's these days can be viewed a bit too quickly. I truly wish they would've included the addition of ""The Talking Dead"" on the extra's. Maybe season three and maybe on a collectors edition? Its a great aftershow that compliments the episodes while they air, and something I think hardcore viewers would like archived on blu-ray to view again.The Walking Dead seasons on blu-ray are a day one must buy in my book.

Darabont left, the budget got cut, and some good ideas paid the price for it. When I first watched Season 2, I thought the plot was a drag and inferior to the incredible pilot this show had. The Sophia storyline was way too dragged out and rarely leaving the farm did little to give us a better idea of the world the characters are living in... HOWEVER, I rewatched all of Season 2 when AMC reaired it a few weeks ago, and I gotta say that when you watch the episodes in that rapid-fire way (in contrast to waiting a week in between episodes), the plot doesn't drag as much as I initially felt. Rewatch it and you'll see your opinion change about the pacing. I still feel Season 2 was inferior to Season 1, but it did enough to keep me entertained and looking forward to Season 3. Let's just hope that it paints a better picture of their world. If I hadn't rewatched it, I would have given this 2 or 3 stars. Lori still needs to get eaten, though.

Makes you stop and think about how things would really be in a zombie filled world, and how morality is subjective when the perceived extinction of mankind is eminently possible.I haven't read the comics yet, but i did buy the first omnibus recently, and from what i understand, the series has been true to the comics, making me even more certain to read them soon, and quickly.Enjoy!",5,Darryl is by far my favorite character so far.

I imagine someone high enough up on the food chain finally reviewed the season footage and had the epiphany of, ""Hey, don't people want to see zombies in a zombie show? Maybe we should give them more of that."" They almost have the rule figured out: zombies must be seen at least twice in every episode, and the first one must be seen within the first 20 minutes, minimum. This time it took until the second half hour so they're close, so close, but regardless its definite progress.It helped that they were tackling some weighty issues in the first half: Are walkers just seriously sick people, not fully responsible for their actions? How badly does something need to be scavenged; is it worth risking somebody's life to get it? And I particularly liked that gun control and abortion were dealt with realistically and without political bias. A baby's cry could feasibly cause someone's death. That's a valid point.Massive props to Maggie for the verbal smackdown she gave both Glenn and Lori. Why is he always receiving the suck jobs and why should other people run her errands at all? I felt like she was giving voice to a lot of viewer concerns, and frankly it was relieving. Speaking of, it was nice to see common sense showing its head once again. Notably with Shane's instructional technique and Maggie and Glenn not using it when out gathering. Yes, the term ""safe"" probably needs a fantastic redefinition nowadays. ""I thought town would be safe."" Based on what you saw in your own little town or the desecration of Atlanta? Get used to it, there is no safe. Not anymore. It's all relative now.The show is worth watching again. It's effectively merging the graphic novels (which by the way, were not always great. Some of them aren't interesting AT ALL) with a viable TV show and its pulling it off. Sure, not flawlessly, but that's rare even on the best of shows. It's good. It's fun.

First off, i'm still extremely upset at how damn expensive it is to buy a season of the walking dead. the first season sold for i believe 30 dollars...can you believe that? for just 6 episodes and very little features in my opinion. now season two has been out for some time and it ranges between $30 to $40 heck even bestbuy has it at 49.99. for what? 13 episodes? that is just too much. anyway back to the product.Languages: English TrueHD 7.1 and French dolby surround 2.0. this series should have more than just two audio language options for the damn price they are charging. besides in the USA, spanish is the second biggest language, not french. so wth is french language the only other option for audio?subtitles: english for deaf and hearing impaired, spanish subs.bonus features: there are 11 bonus featurettes, most of which range from 3mins to around 10min i believe. most are short around 5minutes though. there are 6 webisodes which i actually liked. remember from season 1 ep 2 i believe when Rick gets out of the hospital and sees a bike he uses? and he sees that walker with no legs? well we find out who that walker was with these webisodes. sad story.there are audio commentaries for episodes 1,7,8,11 and 13. the deleted scenes are for the most part lackluster, BUT the very first deleted scene for the season was an awesome scene that i think should of been added to the episode. its actually the longest deleted scene coming in at almost 14min long. remember in season one where those gangs captured glen? and they got glen back and found out the gangs were actually decent men taking care for the elderly? WELL, we go back to that site and find out whats been going on there since we last saw them in season one. i thought that was brilliant!anyway, thats all for season 2 extras. honestly i would go to ee - bai to get this set, because i got it used for $20 in excellent condition thats with shipping. no way am i paying 30 odd dollars for a 13 episode season.",5,My review,1373673600,"07 13, 2013",2013,2100,"['so', 'once', 'again', 'not', 'going', 'review', 'season', 'not', 'reason', 'just', 'what', 'get', 'buying', 'set', 'First', 'i', ""'m"", 'still', 'extremely', 'upset', 'how', 'damn', 'expensive', 'buy', 'season', 'walking', 'dead', 'first', 'season', 'sold', 'i', 'believe', '30', 'dollars', 'can', 'believe', 'just', '6', 'episodes', 'very', 'little', 'features', 'opinion', 'now', 'season', 'two', 'been', 'out', 'time', '30', '40', 'heck', 'even', '49.99.', 'what', '13', 'episodes', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'anyway', 'back', 'product.Languages', 'English', 'TrueHD', '7.1', 'French', 'dolby', 'surround', '2.0.', 'series', 'should', 'have', 'more', 'just', 'two', 'audio', 'language', 'options', 'damn', 'price', 'are', 'charging', 'besides', 'USA', 'spanish', 'second', 'biggest', 'language', 'not', 'french', 'so', 'wth', 'french', 'language', 'only', 'other', 'option', 'audio', 'subtitles', 'english', 'deaf', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'spanish', 'subs.bonus', 'features', 'are', '11', 'bonus', 'featurettes', 'most', 'range', '3mins', '10min', 'i', 'believe', 'most', 'are', 'short', '5minutes', 'are', '6', 'webisodes', 'i', 'actually', 'liked', 'remember', 'season', '1', 'ep', '2', 'i', 'believe', 'when', 'Rick', 'hospital', 'bike', 'walker', 'legs', 'well', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'walker', 'was', 'webisodes', 'sad', 'are', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'episodes', '1,7,8,11', '13.', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'lackluster', 'BUT', 'very', 'first', 'deleted', 'scene', 'season', 'was', 'awesome', 'scene', 'i', 'think', 'should', 'been', 'added', 'episode', 'actually', 'longest', 'deleted', 'scene', 'coming', 'almost', '14min', 'long', 'remember', 'season', 'one', 'where', 'gangs', 'captured', 'glen', 'got', 'glen', 'back', 'found', 'gangs', 'were', 'actually', 'decent', 'men', 'taking', 'care', 'elderly', 'WELL', 'go', 'back', 'site', 'find', 'out', 'whats', 'been', 'going', 'last', 'saw', 'season', 'one', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliant', 'anyway', 'thats', 'season', '2', 'extras', 'honestly', 'i', 'would', 'go', 'ee', 'bai', 'get', 'set', 'i', 'got', 'used', '20', 'excellent', 'condition', 'thats', 'shipping', 'way', 'am', 'i', 'paying', '30', 'odd', 'dollars', '13', 'episode', 'season']",N/A
1493177,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B005LAJ22Q,Sky,"[126, 144]","I read the first 12 issues of Robert Kirkman's epic graphic novel The Walking Dead back in 2006. Late fans to the story can now pick up the first 48 issues of the graphic novel in a convenient single work titledThe Walking Dead:  Compendium One. As of today, Kirkman has published almost 100 issues in the series (that I now anxiously check my mailbox for every month).What's all that mean? It means that there are years and years of TV seasons ahead if AMC stays the course of excellence that it has so far done in the first two seasons. Why? Because as far as the graphic novel issue-by-issue storyline parallel to the TV series goes, I would guesstimate that the TV series is MAYBE through only about the first dozen issues.Has the TV series taken some liberties and made changes to the story(ies) presented in the graphic novel? Sure. But are those liberties just as well told as Kirkman originally laid out? So far so good. Actually, so far: excellent! Kirkman's oversight has brought The Dead to life in this surprisingly fabulous adaptation of the graphic novel series. Why surprisingly? Because it is a rare occasion that a film or TV adaptation is as good as and so true to the source material. This is one of the best shows on TV.The Walking Dead continues the story of (former) Police Officer Rick Grimes and his band of normal-world-refugees across a world suddenly infected by a Walking Dead sickness. Civilization has been replaced by vicious hordes of the undead. But at its core, the story is much less about zombies and more about what happens to society, its morals, laws and standards when government is lost and the planet becomes mostly uninhabitable. There's real, heartfelt emotion in The Walking Dead series combined with believable scenarios.Rest assured, there is no lack of unfathomable chaos and horror in Season 2 of The Walking Dead...although like I said...not just because of the zombies, but mainly as a result of human survivors in desperate situations that must do the unthinkable to stay alive. Fans of the graphic novel will be screaming for Season 3 because of Season 2's final episode cliffhanger glimpse of a certain person and place to come.The Walking Dead is a compelling, thought provoking drama. And if you can't wait until the next season, the good news is you can cheat and start reading the graphic novels if you want to get ahead.Check it out.",5,Get Down With the Sickness,1331510400,"03 12, 2012",2012,2392,"['read', 'first', '12', 'issues', 'Robert', 'Kirkman', 'epic', 'graphic', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'back', '2006', 'Late', 'fans', 'story', 'can', 'now', 'pick', 'up', 'first', '48', 'issues', 'graphic', 'novel', 'convenient', 'single', 'work', 'titledThe', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'Compendium', 'One', 'today', 'Kirkman', 'published', 'almost', '100', 'issues', 'series', 'now', 'anxiously', 'check', 'mailbox', 'month', 'mean', 'are', 'years', 'years', 'TV', 'seasons', 'ahead', 'AMC', 'course', 'excellence', 'so', 'far', 'done', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Why', 'as', 'far', 'graphic', 'novel', 'issue-by-issue', 'storyline', 'parallel', 'TV', 'series', 'would', 'guesstimate', 'TV', 'series', 'MAYBE', 'only', 'first', 'dozen', 'issues.Has', 'TV', 'series', 'taken', 'liberties', 'made', 'changes', 'story', 'ies', 'presented', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Sure', 'are', 'liberties', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'told', 'Kirkman', 'originally', 'laid', 'out', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'Actually', 'far', 'excellent', 'Kirkman', 'oversight', 'brought', 'Dead', 'life', 'surprisingly', 'fabulous', 'adaptation', 'graphic', 'novel', 'series', 'Why', 'surprisingly', 'rare', 'occasion', 'film', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'as', 'good', 'so', 'true', 'source', 'material', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'TV.The', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'story', 'former', 'Police', 'Officer', 'Rick', 'Grimes', 'band', 'normal-world-refugees', 'world', 'suddenly', 'infected', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'sickness', 'Civilization', 'been', 'replaced', 'vicious', 'hordes', 'undead', 'core', 'story', 'much', 'less', 'zombies', 'more', 'what', 'society', 'morals', 'laws', 'standards', 'when', 'government', 'lost', 'planet', 'mostly', 'uninhabitable', 'real', 'heartfelt', 'emotion', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'series', 'combined', 'believable', 'scenarios.Rest', 'assured', 'lack', 'unfathomable', 'chaos', 'horror', 'Season', '2', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'said', 'not', 'just', 'zombies', 'mainly', 'result', 'human', 'survivors', 'desperate', 'situations', 'must', 'do', 'unthinkable', 'stay', 'alive', 'Fans', 'graphic', 'novel', 'will', 'be', 'screaming', 'Season', '3', 'Season', '2', 'final', 'episode', 'cliffhanger', 'glimpse', 'certain', 'person', 'place', 'come.The', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'compelling', 'thought', 'provoking', 'drama', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'season', 'good', 'news', 'can', 'cheat', 'start', 'reading', 'graphic', 'novels', 'want', 'get', 'ahead.Check', 'out']",N/A

But I am interested in great characters and stories, compelling drama and well-produced &#34;television as art.&#34; This show absolutely has/is all of those things. Like other AMC shows Mad Men and Breaking Bad, this one is impeccably crafted. There is a lot of extremely graphic gore; personally, I usually look away for a moment, but if you're especially sensitive to that sort of thing, steer clear. As the very cliched line on this show goes, though, it's really about the characters, making hard choices and holding on to everything good that they can as they fight for survival.

I realize the shows producers were establishing characters and that's important to story telling so I'm not complaining.  TWD has to be the BEST television series ever.  It is gruesome, compelling, disgusting, gory, well written, character driven with a dose of wonderful zombies thrown in for good measure and who doesn't love zombies?  The blood and guts is pretty graphic at times (just remind yourself the zombies aren't really tearing away at human flesh, that's nylons they're chomping away at) so the series isn't for the feint of heart but if you're into heavy duty carnage and adrenaline fueled excitement, this series doesn't disappoint.

After an attack by zombies on a deserted highway Sophia goes missing. Rick (Andrew Lincoln) feels guilty about this and the group spends time looking for her through half of the season discovering a refuge at the farm owned by Herscel a former vet who helps save Rick's son Carl.End of Spoilers:The second season also found the new showrunner Glen Mazzara and his writers struggled with the loss of Frank Darabont but quickly found their footing even as they dealt with budget cuts. The second season sagged a bit during the middle of the season but, on the whole, there was superior character development.Luckily even when the material is a bit sketchy, the actors do their best with the material and always make the show watchable particularly Jon Bernthal as Shane who continues to play the most morally complex character on the show(comparable only to Bryan Cranston's performance as Walt onBreaking Bad: The Complete First Season). At its best ""The Walking Dead"" compares to ""Breaking Bad"" and the best shows on TV.""The Walking Dead"" is shot Super 16mm film. The grainy, coarse presentation on Blu-ray (and the DVD)is intentional--you'll notice it's far grittier looking than AMC's presentation but you'll also notice greater depth, clarity and detail in the Blu-ray presentation. Night scenes particularly benefit from the high def presentation here. Whether or not you'll enjoy the presentation is based on what your expectations of the look of the show should be in high def.The lossless presentation sounds marvelous with a nice, active soundstage. Dialogue is clear throughout.The special features include the 13 minutes that were cut from the revised second season premiere. These scenes along with the rest of the deleted scenes include commentary from wrtier/producer/showrunner Glen Mazzara discussing the reasons why he felt the scenes didn't work and why they were cut. Those 13 minutes make for a fascinating alternate opening for the second season opener. It's a pity that they eliminated the stand-alone epiosde that Darabont planned which would have told us about the man in the tank from season one (much like the webisodes that told us about bicycle girl from the first season--the first zombie that Rick encountered after leaving the hospital that was half eaten and yet still alive. I'd love to see more of these). Working with those budget cuts did impact the quality of the season as well as the narrative making the second season more static than the first.We also get five commentary tracks including Mazzara with a different combination of writers/directors (and with actress Lauren Holden as well). They are pretty informative about the decisions they made in shooting the second season the way they did as well as script decisions.We get a number of featurettes: ""All The Guts Inside"", ""Live or Let Die"", ""The Meat of the Music"", ""Fire on Set"", ""The Ink is Alive"", ""The Sound of Effects"", ""In The Dead of Water"", ""You Could Make A Killing"",""She Will Fight"", ""Extras Wardrobe"" and ""The Cast Of Season Two"" focuses on everything from make up effects, the music score, the sound effects, the change of the character of Andrea over the course of the second season and the cast discussing the challenges of the second season.Unlike the original first season set, this set comes packed with special features. The transfer looks gritty and coarse but that's how it is supposed to look. Character development is truly the star for the second season of ""The Walking Dead"".Recommended.",4,The survivors during the second season are the walking wounded as they struggle with loss,1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,3665,"['Blu-ray', 'review', 'Spoilers', 'second', 'season', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'survivors', 'became', 'walking', 'wounded', 'tried', 'regroup', 'losing', 'members', 'attack', 'zombies', 'deserted', 'highway', 'Sophia', 'missing', 'Rick', 'Andrew', 'Lincoln', 'guilty', 'group', 'time', 'looking', 'half', 'season', 'discovering', 'refuge', 'farm', 'owned', 'Herscel', 'former', 'vet', 'who', 'save', 'Rick', 'son', 'Carl.End', 'Spoilers', 'second', 'season', 'also', 'found', 'new', 'showrunner', 'Glen', 'Mazzara', 'writers', 'struggled', 'loss', 'Frank', 'Darabont', 'quickly', 'found', 'footing', 'even', 'dealt', 'budget', 'cuts', 'second', 'season', 'sagged', 'bit', 'middle', 'season', 'whole', 'was', 'superior', 'character', 'development.Luckily', 'even', 'when', 'material', 'bit', 'sketchy', 'actors', 'do', 'best', 'material', 'always', 'make', 'show', 'watchable', 'particularly', 'Jon', 'Bernthal', 'Shane', 'who', 'play', 'most', 'morally', 'complex', 'character', 'show', 'comparable', 'only', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'performance', 'Walt', 'onBreaking', 'Bad', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'best', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'best', 'shows', 'TV', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'shot', 'Super', '16mm', 'film', 'grainy', 'coarse', 'presentation', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'intentional', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'far', 'grittier', 'looking', 'AMC', 'presentation', ""'ll"", 'also', 'notice', 'greater', 'depth', 'clarity', 'detail', 'Blu-ray', 'presentation', 'Night', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'benefit', 'high', 'def', 'presentation', 'here', 'Whether', 'not', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'presentation', 'based', 'what', 'expectations', 'look', 'show', 'should', 'be', 'high', 'def.The', 'lossless', 'presentation', 'marvelous', 'nice', 'active', 'soundstage', 'Dialogue', 'clear', 'special', 'features', 'include', '13', 'minutes', 'were', 'cut', 'revised', 'second', 'season', 'premiere', 'scenes', 'rest', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'include', 'commentary', 'wrtier/producer/showrunner', 'Glen', 'Mazzara', 'discussing', 'reasons', 'why', 'felt', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'why', 'were', 'cut', '13', 'minutes', 'make', 'fascinating', 'alternate', 'opening', 'second', 'season', 'opener', 'pity', 'eliminated', 'stand-alone', 'epiosde', 'Darabont', 'planned', 'would', 'have', 'told', 'man', 'tank', 'season', 'one', 'much', 'webisodes', 'told', 'bicycle', 'girl', 'first', 'season', 'first', 'zombie', 'Rick', 'encountered', 'leaving', 'hospital', 'was', 'eaten', 'yet', 'still', 'alive', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'more', 'Working', 'budget', 'cuts', 'did', 'impact', 'quality', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'narrative', 'making', 'second', 'season', 'more', 'static', 'first.We', 'also', 'get', 'five', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'including', 'Mazzara', 'different', 'combination', 'writers/directors', 'actress', 'Lauren', 'Holden', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'pretty', 'informative', 'decisions', 'made', 'shooting', 'second', 'season', 'way', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'script', 'decisions.We', 'get', 'number', 'featurettes', 'Guts', 'Inside', 'Live', 'Let', 'Die', 'Meat', 'Music', 'Fire', 'Set', 'Ink', 'Alive', 'Sound', 'Effects', 'Dead', 'Water', 'Could', 'Make', 'Killing', 'Will', 'Fight', 'Extras', 'Wardrobe', 'Cast', 'Season', 'Two', 'focuses', 'everything', 'make', 'up', 'effects', 'music', 'score', 'sound', 'effects', 'change', 'character', 'Andrea', 'course', 'second', 'season', 'cast', 'discussing', 'challenges', 'second', 'season.Unlike', 'original', 'first', 'season', 'set', 'set', 'packed', 'special', 'features', 'transfer', 'gritty', 'coarse', 'how', 'supposed', 'look', 'Character', 'development', 'truly', 'star', 'second', 'season', 'Walking', 'Dead', '.Recommended']",N/A

My suggestion to them is to go to the movies and watch Evil Dead, the horrible World War Z or whatever other rubbish Hollywood continues to crank out and pump millions of dollars into which virtually lack any story what so ever and are only made to create more CGI effects to hide the fact that THERE IS NO STORY.I must admit that season 3 was only about 80% great and seemed to loose its way here and there, but now that they have a new show runner, Scott Gimple who wrote some of the best episodes in season 3, and after seeing TWD panel and a preview of season 4 at the 2013 Comicon convention I have total faith the show will be better than ever except for of coarse the constant complainers who endlessly blog about how bad the show has become but for some reason can't stop watching it.Oh by the way, here's another suggestion, if you don't like the show then stop watching it, and shut the ""F"" up, or just stick to the comic book which this show does not follow and stop expecting it to be like the comic books.Hail Odin!!!!!!!!!",5,"There's never been and never will be a series as great as this,",1375747200,"08 6, 2013",2013,1930,"['great', 'drama', 'acting', 'story', 'telling', 'suspense', 'course', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'show', 'supreme.Their', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'ever', 'give', 'show', 'chance', 'just', 'zombies', 'will', 'show', 'ever', 'receive', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'walkers', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'who', 'ratings', 'speak', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'missing', 'F', 'them.This', 'show', 'drama', 'first', 'horror', 'TV', 'series', 'second', 'thought', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'were', 'brilliant', 'was', ""n't"", '1', 'boring', 'episode', 'Just', 'seeing', 'individual', 'characters', 'slowly', 'changing', 'episode', 'episode', 'was', 'interesting', 'me.Some', 'people', 'so-called', 'fans', 'show', 'endlessly', 'complain', 'season', '2', 'farm', 'being', 'boring', 'people', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'horror', 'action', 'fans', 'must', 'see', '100', '%', 'gore', 'episode', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'happy', 'suggestion', 'go', 'movies', 'watch', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'horrible', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'other', 'rubbish', 'Hollywood', 'crank', 'out', 'pump', 'millions', 'dollars', 'virtually', 'lack', 'story', 'what', 'ever', 'are', 'only', 'made', 'create', 'more', 'CGI', 'effects', 'hide', 'fact', 'THERE', 'NO', 'STORY.I', 'must', 'admit', 'season', '3', 'was', 'only', 'about', '80', '%', 'great', 'seemed', 'loose', 'way', 'here', 'there', 'now', 'have', 'new', 'show', 'runner', 'Scott', 'Gimple', 'who', 'wrote', 'best', 'episodes', 'season', '3', 'seeing', 'TWD', 'panel', 'preview', 'season', '4', '2013', 'Comicon', 'convention', 'have', 'total', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'ever', 'coarse', 'constant', 'complainers', 'who', 'endlessly', 'blog', 'how', 'bad', 'show', 'become', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'it.Oh', 'way', 'here', 'suggestion', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'show', 'then', 'stop', 'watching', 'shut', 'F', 'up', 'just', 'stick', 'comic', 'book', 'show', 'not', 'follow', 'stop', 'expecting', 'be', 'comic', 'books.Hail', 'Odin']",N/A
