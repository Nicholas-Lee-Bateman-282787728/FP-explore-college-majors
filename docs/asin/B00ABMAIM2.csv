1607676,A3FCLVBY9O5DOS,B00ABMAIM2,A Customer,"[1, 1]","This is a somewhat silly story but an interesting one involving  Nazi competition for great art after they conquered Europe.  Unlike much of later Nazi stuff, it portrays them as human beings, albeit monstrously corrupted ones.  Joss Ackland's performance as Hermann Goering deftly treads a fine line between fading humanity and rising lunacy.  Cheri Lunghi, a somewhat neglected actress, turns in a fine performance as a Polish refugee forced into prostitution, and David McCallum gives an outstanding one as the spoiled, childish son of the Hotel Ritz's owner.  The series is erotic without being vulgar, another quality that has gotten rare recently.  Nudity, but not endless four letter words and simulated copulations.  It evokes the period well too, with a great Edith Piaf lookalike song number. The DVD is pretty basic: subtitles would have helped.

1607678,A3WHB14P5QPRJ,B00ABMAIM2,Cat,"[7, 8]","""The Man Who Lived at The Ritz"" is a Swedish-made television movie that has been available in Region 2 DVD format for several years. ""Ritz"" may not be an Emmy winner, but the movie is as good or better than the average made-for-tv fare.The movie begins shortly before WWII and the Nazi occupation of Paris. King's character, Philip Weber, is living in Paris in a small suite at the Ritz thanks to a bequest contained in his uncle's will. After studying art, Weber establishes a studio in the city. Surprisingly, after Hermann Goering commandeers the Ritz as his personal base in Paris, a few residents, including Weber and Coco Chanel, are allowed to stay.As Weber witnesses the effects of the Nazi occupation within Paris, he also learns of the underhanded dealings between Goering and other high-ranking Nazi officials who pilfer confiscated art from each other.King's portrayal of Weber was lackluster as a romantic lead, but his involvement in the main storyline of cross and double-cross kept his performance from falling flat completely. The solid performances of Joss Ackland, portraying a hedonistic and narcissistic Hermann Goering; Leslie Caron's channeling the persona of Coco Chanel; and David McCallum's role as Charlie Ritz, a well-bred, charming man, semi-involved with the running of the hotel, kept the movie from being bland.The primary theme that yesterday's friend might be tomorrow's back-stabbing enemy, kept the suspense fueled throughout most of the movie.",3,"A brief synopsis, and not so harshly reviewed",1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,1480,"['Man', 'Who', 'Lived', 'Ritz', 'Swedish-made', 'television', 'movie', 'been', 'available', 'Region', '2', 'DVD', 'format', 'several', 'years', 'Ritz', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Emmy', 'winner', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'better', 'average', 'made-for-tv', 'fare.The', 'movie', 'shortly', 'WWII', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'Paris', 'King', 'character', 'Philip', 'Weber', 'living', 'Paris', 'small', 'suite', 'Ritz', 'thanks', 'bequest', 'contained', 'uncle', 'will', 'studying', 'art', 'Weber', 'studio', 'city', 'Surprisingly', 'Hermann', 'Goering', 'commandeers', 'Ritz', 'personal', 'base', 'Paris', 'few', 'residents', 'including', 'Weber', 'Coco', 'Chanel', 'are', 'allowed', 'stay.As', 'Weber', 'effects', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'Paris', 'also', 'underhanded', 'dealings', 'Goering', 'other', 'high-ranking', 'Nazi', 'officials', 'who', 'pilfer', 'confiscated', 'art', 'other.King', 'portrayal', 'Weber', 'was', 'lackluster', 'romantic', 'lead', 'involvement', 'main', 'storyline', 'cross', 'double-cross', 'kept', 'performance', 'falling', 'flat', 'completely', 'solid', 'performances', 'Joss', 'Ackland', 'portraying', 'hedonistic', 'narcissistic', 'Hermann', 'Goering', 'Leslie', 'Caron', 'channeling', 'persona', 'Coco', 'Chanel', 'David', 'McCallum', 'role', 'Charlie', 'Ritz', 'well-bred', 'charming', 'man', 'semi-involved', 'running', 'hotel', 'kept', 'movie', 'being', 'bland.The', 'primary', 'theme', 'yesterday', 'friend', 'might', 'be', 'tomorrow', 'back-stabbing', 'enemy', 'kept', 'suspense', 'fueled', 'most', 'movie']",Man Who Lived at the Ritz

1607680,AHHUNTFQGUGX8,B00ABMAIM2,Cody Carlson,"[1, 1]","&#34;The Man Who Lived at the Ritz&#34; was based upon the bestselling novel by A. E. Hotchner and tales to story of an American artist living in Paris during the German occupation.  At first, the protagonist attempts to remain neutral but increasingly finds himself dragged into a world of cloak and dagger mystery as he is recruited by the French Resistance.  As far as historical accuracy goes- don't bother looking, you won't find it.  As a drama, it is a bit too melodramatic at times, but generally succeeds in created a fun adventure/romance film that almost feels like something out of the 1940s.In one way that it distinctly feels unlike a 1940s feature is the surprising amount of female nudity on display.  I remember watching this on TV as a kid with my parents and the nudity certainly wasn't there for American broadcast TV.  This was no doubt originally shot for European distribution, and I believe the film was a European production.  Despite that element, the film is really built upon an intriguing plot and genuinely engaging characters.  Perhaps the highlight of this film is Joss Ackland, who plays Nazi bigwig Hermann Goering.  While the portrayal isn't 100% accurate, it is nevertheless a lot of fun to see this under-appreciated actor steal every scene.  Cherie Lunghi was also quite good as the principle love interest.If you enjoy WWII era spy stories with a little romance, you should check out &#34;That Man Who Lived at the Ritz.&#34;",4,"Good World War II Adventure Tale, If a Little Hokey At Times",1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,1464,"['34', 'Man', 'Who', 'Lived', 'Ritz', '34', 'was', 'based', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'A.', 'E.', 'Hotchner', 'tales', 'story', 'American', 'artist', 'living', 'Paris', 'German', 'occupation', 'first', 'protagonist', 'attempts', 'remain', 'neutral', 'increasingly', 'dragged', 'world', 'cloak', 'dagger', 'mystery', 'recruited', 'French', 'Resistance', 'As', 'far', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'goes-', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'looking', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'drama', 'bit', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'times', 'generally', 'created', 'fun', 'adventure/romance', 'film', 'almost', 'feels', 'something', '1940s.In', 'one', 'way', 'distinctly', '1940s', 'feature', 'surprising', 'amount', 'female', 'nudity', 'display', 'remember', 'watching', 'TV', 'kid', 'parents', 'nudity', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'American', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'was', 'doubt', 'originally', 'shot', 'European', 'distribution', 'believe', 'film', 'was', 'European', 'production', 'element', 'film', 'really', 'built', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'genuinely', 'engaging', 'characters', 'Perhaps', 'highlight', 'film', 'Joss', 'Ackland', 'who', 'Nazi', 'bigwig', 'Hermann', 'Goering', 'portrayal', ""n't"", '100', '%', 'accurate', 'nevertheless', 'lot', 'fun', 'see', 'under-appreciated', 'actor', 'steal', 'scene', 'Cherie', 'Lunghi', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'principle', 'love', 'interest.If', 'enjoy', 'WWII', 'era', 'spy', 'stories', 'little', 'romance', 'should', 'check', 'out', '34', 'Man', 'Who', 'Lived', 'Ritz.', '34']",Man Who Lived at the Ritz
