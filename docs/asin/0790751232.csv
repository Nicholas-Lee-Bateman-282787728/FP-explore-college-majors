After I watched it the first time I sat nearly to tears through the credits, with my mouth agape. I know movies like that don't seem to be the greatest, but this one works. I love good movies. The kind that make absolute sense and leave a mark on your heart. The ending is so shocking, and unexpected that it totally caught me off guard. That is a big complement, because nowadays you can pretty much guess the way a movie is going. Butch (Kostner) escapes from prison with an absolute piece of slime for a partner. They try to steal a car and get some food from a resident, but instead end up with a hostage named phillip, a young boy without a father that has been sheltered his entire life from anything exciting. After a series of events the slime bucket partner is out of the picture (a scene that stands on its own as just plain deserved), and soon it is just Butch and Phillip. The boy tugs on butch's heart and becomes Phillip's father figure. Eastwood is the sherrif responsible for bringing in Butch. The story between them run's far back into the years, and Eastwood blames himself for Butch's life. Laura Dern, excellent in whatever she does, stays beside the reluctant Eastwood in the pursuit. She is in a time where woman are just breaking through into the work force, let alone making an influence. She is sharp as a tack, and knows the tragic history behind Butch. I try to find an answer in every film I watch and review. The question is, &quot;in a perfect world, would people like butch exhist?&quot; And in reply I say, most definately, but the tragedy that creates men with hatred, would be nowhere in sight. This is the second greatest movie of all time (next to awakenings).

121350,AI46E73DWKD2B,0790751232,BackToGood,"[0, 1]","For all the hoopla surrounding Clint Eastwood's post-1990 oeuvre of films (UNFORGIVEN, MYSTIC RIVER, MILLION DOLLAR BABY, etc.), it is ironic that his true best-directed and best film of this time period is one that didn't garner any major Academy Award nominations, A PERFECT WORLD (1993). Set in 1963 Texas, this film also contains the BEST performance of any Eastwood film post-1990, that by none other than the famous Kevin Costner, who stars as escaped prisoner Butch Haynes. Costner delivers a truly memorable performance, playing Butch as a disturbed man with layers of humanity that you don't see in most on-screen ""villains"". Costner tweaks his own everyday Joe persona just enough to make Butch simultaneously charming and frightening. I found Costner's Butch way scarier than more in-your-face style villains and psychos (Hannibal Lecter, the Joker, et al!). The reason is that Butch could go off at any moment in an all too realistic way the way that REAL people do! I'd say it was the most underrated performance by a star of his caliber in all of the 1990s! Costner was robbed of a Best Actor nomination.Costner gets great support from young T.J. Lowther (who plays Phillip/Buzz, the kid that Butch kidnaps). With minimal dialogue during most of the film, Lowther exudes a lot with very little. His quietness, silence, and reactions to Butch's conversation and actions spoke volumes! I'll never understand why performances have to be so over-the-top and bombastic to get Oscar nominations or win! Costner and Lowther's performances are TIMELESS. Re-watch this film and you'll see what I'm talking about! The way Butch and Phillip interact in this film is about as genuine as I've seen an adult and child interact in any film.A major reason that I find A PERFECT WORLD to be Eastwood's most ""perfect"" film post-1990 is, in addition to it's inviting main characters, it also has what I think is the most perfect overall cast down to the most minute role. I can't say that of films such as UNFORGIVEN (which has too many minor characters, some of which are just retreads of others and also a major character that I find not of great use) or MYSTIC RIVER (which has 2 main characters that are the most annoying of the movie, not to mention that it is convoluted, manipulative and cloying as hell!). In A PERFECT WORLD, I always remember how convincing the Texas storeowners and denizens that Butch and Buzz came across reactions were to them. From their first encounter with the storeowner who essentially witnessed Butch kill his fellow escapee to the lusty owner of that roadside diner that had the hots for Butch. It is rare to see such an eclectic group of genuine characters like this that add to a film, rather than detract from it.Eastwood himself as Texas Ranger Red Garnett, Butch's main pursuer, plays his role with just the right amount of world-weariness and veteran savvy that is a staple of the legend himself. Red's parallel tale of pursuit (with well cast character actors such as Laura Dern and Bradley Whitford along for the ride) is the perfect complement to Butch and Buzz's central story, which drives the film.A PERFECT WORLD is also perhaps the best ROAD film of all time, bar none! Part of what probably hurt the film at the Oscars that year is that Eastwood's acclaimed epic UNFORGIVEN (although I do have several complaints about it, it is a good film), which had re-introduced the Western to Hollywood forefront, had dominated the year before and there was essentially no way that such a ""smaller"" film like A PERFECT WORLD stood a chance. Not to mention that I think that Costner himself has always been unfairly dismissed (too much for my taste) as some kind of lightweight actor. He is anything but lightweight in this film.

It would pop to the forefront of my mind in the oddest of circumstances.  I thought it was just the image of a child in a Casper the Friendly Ghost costume roaming the countryside that made the film memorable, but upon seeing it again last week I realized that as interesting as that image is to me, 'A Perfect World' is simply a very well crafted movie.Costner is in rare form (I havent seen as good a performance from him since 'Dances With Wolves') and the child actor has given us one of the truest depictions of childhood in years.  The story itself asks questions such as what makes us who we are, is it possible to change, what is the emotional impact of violence, why do we judge people and questions the ligitamacy of sacrifice.  The movie has a slow and languid pace to let these questions develop but you're never beaten over the head by them.  Most everything in 'A Perfect World' is understated. I like that in a movie but it can slow things down a bit.  Also, as great as Eastwood is in the movie, I felt this was a role he has played so many times over the years that he could do it in his sleep.  I wanted to see him tackle something a bit different.This DVD presentation features a very crisp image (widescreen only) and enveloping sound.  The movie has been digitally remastered and you'll probably never see a better print of it.  Bonus wise, you only get a few sketchy actors bios and a threatrical trailer.  This allows the film to stand on it's own and allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions.

It was right on target about lack of parenting and abuse and the consequences in adults.  The damage that is done.  Quite a moving experience.  Eastwood does not back away from raw and hard emotion, nor does he give any answers.  This, together with ""This Boy's Life"" , with De Niro, Ellen Barkin, and DiCaprio, really protray an abysmal picture of the way children are thought of in America.  Children, our future, the best part of us.  I was very affected by this film, of children in jeopardy.  For a man who started out so silent and stony in his early movies, a man so hard and barren, in his direction he can really bring emotions to the quick - he never backs away.

Sure, you get some faith based people who cannot handle a little filmic portrayal of their religion and yadda yadda. You can't look past the perfection of themes here. The faith in this line is just another 'faith' in general really. It's used to portray a child as isolated and attached to nothing but the religions he was brought up on. A child without a father. A religion that MIGHT produce confused and curious children who often want to know what lies beyond their confines... it doesn't matter which religion it is I wish people could see that.Like it or not these kinds of emotions are what intense orthodox religion does to people in many cases. In some cases it teaches them some morals and in others it just solidifies a variety of other things both good and bad depending on the individual. The relationship between Costner and the boy is played to perfection. This is quite honestly one of Eastwood's greatest films. I think his current output is a bit overrated bar a couple films and I LOVE the subtly in the ending here as opposed to Gran Turino which imho was totally bonkers by the end and unreal.Anyway, the direction and photography are near perfect and the acting is stellar. People harp on Kevin sometimes but he really isn't that bad at all and in this one he is fabulous. Eastwood fits in perfectly as the ambiguous ranger and the child plays his part to perfection.

Both filmmakers prefer to focus on character development over fast-paced action; both gradually build their films up to emotionally draining conclusions (see &quot;Unforgiven,&quot; &quot;Open Range,&quot; and this film).This movie defies all expectations and emerges as a thoughtful, quirky little drama about the consequences of child abuse and neglect. Though billed as a confrontation between Clint and Kev, the two stars play only one scene together, and that in long shot. The movie consciously avoids over-the-top action and melodrama, finding instead strange moments of humor that emerge when you least expect it. There is violence in the picture, and yet another mature consideration of gunplay (as in &quot;Unforgiven&quot;), but most of the violence is off screen and is not the focal point of the picture. This isn't &quot;Dirty Harry.&quot;Costner gets the lion's share of screen time as Butch Haynes, an escaped convict who takes a little boy hostage. The movie isn't so much about a manhunt, however, as it is the stunningly odd relationship that develops between con and kid. Both have been held captive: Butch, by the penal system, the kid, by institutionalized religion. Both are also without fathers. It's a sad, doomed relationship, but one in which both characters find redemption.The movie is flawed. Clint's direction is uneven; I think there were some missed dramatic opportunities here. The climax is noticeably protracted; I doubt a man with a gut wound could wander as far out in the country as does one of the characters. You could almost say that, in spite of all the big stars, nothing happens. And Laura Dern is completely out of place and mis-cast; her final scene (a knee in the groin to Bradley Whitford) plays jarringly to the audience.The saving graces are Costner and T.J. Lowther, as the kid, Phillip. Costner shows that he has true grit as an actor, giving a movie star turn that is far-removed from his Crash Davis in &quot;Bull Durham&quot; and John Dunbar in &quot;Dances With Wolves.&quot; We can see that Butch is messed up and not a good person -- but neither, as he himself points out, is he the worst. This is one of Costner's best performances and I really hope he returns to this style of work.Eastwood is credible as Texas Ranger Red Garnett, but that's about it; I understand his character was extensively re-written so Clint could have more screen time, and it feels that way.In short, Costner's performance for a change far outshines the movie that it's in. &quot;A Perfect World&quot; isn't bad, but it's not the best, either.",3,Quirky little movie,1070755200,"12 7, 2003",2003,2697,"['quot', 'A', 'Perfect', 'World', 'quot', 'kind', 'slow-fuse', 'drama', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'are', 'known', 'filmmakers', 'prefer', 'focus', 'character', 'development', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'gradually', 'build', 'films', 'emotionally', 'draining', 'conclusions', 'see', 'quot', 'Unforgiven', 'quot', 'quot', 'Open', 'Range', 'quot', 'film', 'movie', 'defies', 'expectations', 'thoughtful', 'quirky', 'little', 'drama', 'consequences', 'child', 'abuse', 'neglect', 'Though', 'billed', 'confrontation', 'Clint', 'Kev', 'two', 'stars', 'play', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'together', 'long', 'shot', 'movie', 'consciously', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'melodrama', 'finding', 'instead', 'strange', 'moments', 'humor', 'emerge', 'when', 'least', 'expect', 'violence', 'picture', 'yet', 'mature', 'consideration', 'gunplay', 'quot', 'Unforgiven', 'quot', 'most', 'violence', 'screen', 'not', 'focal', 'point', 'picture', ""n't"", 'quot', 'Dirty', 'Harry.', 'quot', 'Costner', 'lion', 'share', 'screen', 'time', 'Butch', 'Haynes', 'escaped', 'convict', 'who', 'little', 'boy', 'hostage', 'movie', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'manhunt', 'however', 'stunningly', 'odd', 'relationship', 'con', 'kid', 'have', 'been', 'held', 'captive', 'Butch', 'penal', 'system', 'kid', 'institutionalized', 'religion', 'are', 'also', 'fathers', 'sad', 'doomed', 'relationship', 'one', 'characters', 'find', 'redemption.The', 'movie', 'flawed', 'Clint', 'direction', 'uneven', 'think', 'were', 'missed', 'dramatic', 'opportunities', 'here', 'climax', 'noticeably', 'protracted', 'doubt', 'man', 'gut', 'wound', 'could', 'wander', 'far', 'country', 'one', 'characters', 'could', 'almost', 'say', 'spite', 'big', 'stars', 'nothing', 'happens', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'completely', 'place', 'mis-cast', 'final', 'scene', 'knee', 'groin', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'jarringly', 'audience.The', 'saving', 'graces', 'are', 'Costner', 'T.J.', 'Lowther', 'kid', 'Phillip', 'Costner', 'true', 'grit', 'actor', 'giving', 'movie', 'star', 'turn', 'far-removed', 'Crash', 'Davis', 'quot', 'Bull', 'Durham', 'quot', 'John', 'Dunbar', 'quot', 'Dances', 'Wolves.', 'quot', 'can', 'see', 'Butch', 'messed', 'up', 'not', 'good', 'person', 'neither', 'out', 'worst', 'one', 'Costner', 'best', 'performances', 'really', 'hope', 'style', 'work.Eastwood', 'credible', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'Red', 'Garnett', 'understand', 'character', 'was', 'extensively', 're-written', 'Clint', 'could', 'have', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'way.In', 'short', 'Costner', 'performance', 'change', 'far', 'movie', 'quot', 'A', 'Perfect', 'World', 'quot', ""n't"", 'bad', 'not', 'best']",N/A

That said, Kevin Costner performs admirably in his role, as does the kid. Rather light, simple fare altogether, similar to many other Clint Eastwood movies. Nothing new under the sun here. But is that necessarily bad? I don't think so.Somehow, this movie makes you cheer for an overgrown adult boy/man who is encouraging a six year-old to be a juvenile delinquent. That sounds bad, but it's actually not so bad. Costner, who plays an escaped convict, is a polite gentleman bandit on the order of Robin Hood and the like, a hero/villain. He abides by certain principles, and is not entirely wicked, unlike his fellow escapee, a cretinous goblin. Discerning the good versus the bad in his character is the whole point of the movie. We also learn what may have contributed to making him the way he is.As for the boy, he has no father and was being raised by a strict single mom that did not let him do hardly anything that has any fun in it--for religious reasons, apparently. He was in dire need of a father figure, and finds that in Costner.

Set in 1963, it's the story of escaped convict Butch Haynes (Kevin Costner), who kidnaps a small boy and leads a manhunt team (led by Eastwood) on a chase through the back roads of Texas. More than the story, the appeal of the film lies in its powerful evocation of southern Texas at a simpler time and in the relationship that develops between the convict and his captive. Eastwood the director lures us in slowly, as the hardened but decent and affable Butch evolves from captor to a sort of father figure to his young hostage. Then the fallacy of this bond is brought vividly to life by the film's conclusion. As Buzz, the boy, TJ Lowther is a revelation. He was only seven at the time, but he displayed remarkable assurance and presence in this role.There are some flaws: The film goes on a bit too long; Bradley Whitford (now better known as Josh Lyman on ""The West Wing"") is a rather one-dimensional Federal agent; and Laura Dern's progressive female character seems too modern for the storyline. Nonetheless, the film works very well when it focuses on Butch and Buzz, and the ending avoids excessive sentimentality.

Butch, despite some other reviews, is neither good nor bad but he is (definitely) essentially good at heart.You have to wonder about the type of person Butch would have been given different circumstances.  That's not to excuse his crimes because I definitely believe that adults are responsible for their actions regardless of the upbringing that they had.  Nonetheless, Butch is definitely a thoughtful and caring individual.  He admires family men and abhors violence against children.  Self motivated above all else but still caring.  He's done what he had to for freedom.  But is it fair that he suffered so much as a youth while perhaps Red (Clint Eastwood) is ultimately the most responsible for turning him into the harderned criminal that he is?  That's the essential question.  What's right, who's responsible, and who's to blame.Clint is great (as always) as the grizzled hard nosed Texas Ranger assigned to hunt Haines down.  But it is his direction that has to really be admired.  Subtle yet powerful.  The story is what drives the greatness of the film though.  Good guys who aren't so good and bad guys who aren't so bad and the different ugly sides of many of the players.  Why is it that Haines' escape partner is such a scumbag while Haines is intelligent and compassionate (at times).  Why is a conservative law man like Red sympathetic towards Butch while the FBI man is so callous?

In a perfect world there would be no child abuse or neglect and damaged children. In a perfect world an eight-year-old boy would not kill a man abusing his mother.This is not a perfect world and so the story is told. Butch Haynes (Kevin Costner) grew up in a brothel in New Orleans, killed his mother's abuser, but was not punished. At age 12 Texas Ranger Red Garnett (Clint Eastwood) saw to it that Butch was sent to juvie lockup for four years, with the idea of protecting him from his felonious and abusive father.When the movie starts, Butch and another man break out of prison, kidnap Phillip, just a boy caught up one of those situations. The other man is eliminated from the story early on. Butch and Phillip begin their road trip, a movement toward Alaska for Butch, a growing affection for a father he never had for Phillip. The synergy created by this man, neither good nor bad, and boy grows from negatives--each trying to create in Butch a father figure for those absent.As in any road trip film, encounters with others mark the travelers in terms of character. Butch never intentionally harms anyone until child abuse occurs. Even then the viewer knows there will be no physical harm.Inevitably, the manhunt ends and it isn't pleasant. After I saw this movie at the theater, I cried all the way home. The ex was annoyed and told me it was just a movie. Some people don't understand that art IS the truth. Child abuse does exist and does ruin lives. According to Laura Dern's character, a criminologist, Butch was tested in prison for high intelligence. Imagine what he could have been with a typical life! Even with his flawed background, he tried to do right by Phillip, even at the end.A perfect world. It does not exist. So what is a person to do? A criminologist tries to teach explanations and understandings. Law enforcement tries to protect others by rounding up the doers of evil and bad things. Those caught in the ring of violence try to escape to a better life.

It held up the second time and it was certainly a pleasure getting to see Clint Eastwood, Kevin Costner, and Laura Dern in the same film. Costner plays an escaped prison inmate, a man who is tortured by his past and his abusive upbringing but who also has no future, as the dragnet slowly tightens its noose. You get a sense from the very beginning that the movie will end tragically in his death, but for now he has a taste of freedom. Eastwood plays the cynical but sedulous Texas Ranger who is determined to bring Costner in, alive if possible. Dern plays the Fed psychologist and profiler who is always getting in Eastwood's face, and their strained relationship provides one of the main sources of tension in the movie. And the young boy, I don't know his name, is really superb as Costner's captive.Costner, for all his flaws as an adult, understands kids, and the friendship that develops between the boy and Costner's character is the main psychological focus of the film. Despite being on the lam, Costner manages to show the kid at least something of a good time, and how that comes about is one of the charms of the movie, but I won't go into any details so as not to provide any spoilers. Although a commercial failure (perhaps because of Costner being cast against type as a bad guy), the move is certainly an artistic success since the entire cast is truly great in their roles.

The film demonstrates Eastwood's typical minimalistic approach to directing, and relies on character development and exploration moreso than it does story. This bare bones approach by Eastwood works like a charm, to bring to film a whimsical tale.Costner pulls off probably his most laudable and competent role in any of his movies, transcending even Dances with Wolves. His effort is very understated, controlled and ultimately utterly convincing in his delivery. This role from Costner is equally and ably supported by T J Lowther as the young boy Philip. The performances of these two actors ultimately make this such a winning film. They are ably supported by Clint Eastwood and Laura Dern.What really drives this film is the relationship that develops between Butch and Philip. Philip gets his much needed father figure and Haynes gets an opportunity to play a more fatherly role to Philip than the father who neglected him. By three quarters of the way through the movie the viewer is hoping that Haynes and Philip can escape the manhunt and start new lives together - which in a perfect world probably would have happened!Without disclosing the ending, what ultimately happens in the movie is a true testament to the depths reached and expressed between man and boy. In a very unmelodramatic fashion a heart-wrenching ending is reached.By the end this a whimsical story of might have beens, and possibilities. The understated manner in which all aspects of the movie are approached make it all the more poignant and fulfilling. Anyone who likes a good solid drama should appreciate this film!P.S. A number a criticisms directed at the portrayal of Jehova Witnesses is unfortunate. The movie is clearly not intending to pass any judgement on such beliefs. In any religion the level of piety is very much a personal thing.

First, this is the very best of Clint Eastwood both as a director and actor. Eastwood the director learned his trade from Don Siegel, who made a bunch of no-nonsense 70's action films, many of them with Eastwood as the star. Eastwood learned his trade well from the master. He can edit the fat out of a film very effectively. Eastwood the actor really shines in this film as well in a supporting role as a Texas Ranger at the tail end of a career doing a kind of slow burn as events unfold around him.This film is also Kevin Costner's best work ever, and one has to imagine it came because Director Eastwood sat on him hard. Whatever, Costner gives a very, very good performance, full of depth as a prisoner on the lam. He is actually tough and touching at the same time, no small feat for any actor.Finally, Laura Dern is also at her best in this film. What happened to her, anyway? Where did she go? Anyway, the romance between the Eastwood character and Dern is understated and very moving, as each character slowly gain respect for the other. Dern is not classically beautiful, but she comes off as very real and smart, with a sense of humor and a real humanity. Hollywood needs more like her, instead of fashion models playing cops.

An escaped  convict (Costner) kidnaps a boy and is on the run from the law (Eastwood)  and each of their lives are changed forever. The film is especially  touching whenever it focuses on the growing relationship between the  convict &amp; boy - Costner's portrayal of the tough escapee with a kind  heart is great and the boy is so natural and likeable.

This film takes a look at the nature of violence and compassion through the eyes of a child and a hardened criminal. In one of the first films directed by the legendary Clint Eastwood, Kevin Costner gives one of the best performances of his career. As Butch Haynes, he is seemingly a hardcore criminal who only cares about himself until a kidnapping victim starts to change who he is. Haynes sees this boy comes from the same situation he did, but he doesn't want to see him turn out the same way. While, newcomer T.J. Lowther is the focus of the film, he only does an adequate job in his role, showing little emotion and not quite speak clearly enough.

121413,A18C1PCR8WUAST,0790751232,"Tracy Hodson ""Awi Usdi""","[96, 103]","Continuing his exploration of what makes a man good, bad -- just plain human-- is what this film delves into, even more deeply than in the stunning &quot;Unforgiven&quot; (to his credit, Eastwood never pretends, as some male writers and directors do, that he understands women; instead, he admits that we are mysteries to him, and concentrates his energies on what he does understand: American men). Refusing to subscribe to typical American cinematic over-simplifications of &quot;good vs. evil,&quot; Clint Eastwood delivers films that make you realize very quickly that there is no room for such absolutes when dealing with human truths. This thesis, which he has been pursuing for some time now, perhaps starting with &quot;Tightrope&quot; where the line between good and evil blurs to invisibility, he has, with &quot;A Perfect World,&quot; given us a translation of John Lee Hancock's brilliant screenplay that is both beautiful and almost too painful to bear. Noted by critics at the time of its relase, but completley ignored by audiences who, it seems, found Kevin Costner as an escaped convict just too unpalatable, this film takes us on a complex journey deep into the souls of two tortured men, Costner's &quot;Butch Haynes&quot; and Eastwood's &quot;Red,&quot; the Texas Ranger who is charged with running the escaped Haynes down. The past and its consequences are a continual theme in all of Eastwood's important works, and in this film, the ironies are neck-deep and take time and patience from the viewer to unravel. Even the decision by Red to commandeer the vehicle the Governer intends to ride in the next day when President Kennedy will be in Dallas (this is 1963) brings up the question: would the Governer have been shot had he been in this vehicle instead of in the President's car? This is one subtle example of how decision and consequence are continously explored in this most thought-provoking of films.Kevin Costner gave probably the best performance of his life, cast against type as a complex man who cannot be called either bad or good, merely profoundly human, whose life has followed a course laid by poverty, homelessness, a suicide mother and a felonious father, a bit of high spirits, and high intelligence with nowhere to go, but most importantly, the Texas penal system as it was managed in the 60's. Haynes' moral center, despite his acts, never wavers, and it is that moral center that propels events which finally spiral out of his control and into tragedy. But we see, clearly, that even a so-called &quot;bad&quot; man can be good enough to inspire genuine, deep love that, in the end, redeems both him and the person whose initial action started the long chain of events that ends with the 36 hours over which this film takes place (we discover who this is along the way, and I don't want to lessen the impact of any discoveries). Another reviewer here implied that it was Eastwood who is responsible for Costner's excellence in this film, but having seen so many interviews with his actors, it is generally understood that Eastwood casts his actors, then leaves them alone to find the character and reveal him without a great deal of interference, so it would seem that the credit is, indeed, Costner's. Sadly, he never again worked against type, perhaps because of this film's commercial failure, but this performance will always stand as testament to what he can do, and never is that performance better than in the house where Cajun music on the Victrola and senseless violence against a boy much of an age as Butch himself was when violence entered his life, combine to send him into a sort of fugue state of memory, pain, longing, rage, and ultimately, the loss of control that brings things to a terrible end.The boy, Philip, with whom he bonds (played beautifully by the transparent T.J. Lowther) also gives us his heart laid bare, and the rapport between the two of them is completely believable. We understand the child's repeated choices to stay with Butch, and the reasons go far beyond the superficial need for a father (his is gone), and into the realm of love. It is from Haynes that he learns the lesson that exacts the price of Haynes' escape, but then it is his love for Haynes that makes it bearable, and even right, for both of them, as in the end, he becomes the protector--the man--whose job it is to help a loved-one who can no longer help himself.When a film's characters are torn apart by the end of a film, its viewers should be, too, and we definitely are. It is a difficult, heart-breaking journey that Clint Eastwood insists we take with him, but taking it brings us to the point where we should start each day: from scratch. Red's last line is, &quot;I don't know a da*n thing anymore,&quot; and that is exactly the point and the purpose of this story. We should never, ever think we have all the answers; to do so is fatal, as Red learns. Every day we should be willing to examine our beliefs and look back, with honesty, at what we've done, and look forward to what we're about to do with eyes wide open and with some sort of awareness of potential damage, and know, always, that there is no good &quot;us,&quot; no bad &quot;them,&quot; but that we're all only human beings, deeply flawed and yet filled with the capacity for love and connection, each of us doing the best we can.",5,Eastwood journeys deeper into the heart of the American male,1086048000,"06 1, 2004",2004,5357,"['Continuing', 'exploration', 'what', 'man', 'good',

Clint Eastwood the director fares better than Eastwood the actor, who could quite easily be cut out of the film, having little to do and doing it with minimum interest. Ditto Laura Dern's psychologist, who seems to be there solely to give Eastwood someone to talk to, but Kevin Costner is surprisingly good as the maladjusted convict on the run, coming into his own in a scene where he terrorises a black family (it's at this point you can just hear the film's box-office potential nosedive) with T.J. Lowther convincingly unmovielike as the young Jehovah's Witness he takes hostage and shows how to have fun.

In the end, the Buzz kid seems to have learned to love the man who kidnaps him, like he would a parent ....if you however did not want to think too deeply about the characters' raison d'etres, Eastwood serves up an old fashioned road chase movie in the Texas of Kennedy era 1962-63.
