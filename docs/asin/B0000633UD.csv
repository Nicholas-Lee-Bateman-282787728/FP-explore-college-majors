Gordon,"[2, 2]","This feels a bit like of mix of Percy Adlon's earlier 'Bagdad Caf&eacute;' andRobert Altman's 'Three Women', set in Alaska.k.d. lang plays an androgynous miner who falls in love with a straight, private, local German librarian.They both have muddy, tragic pasts that slowly emerge.  There are some deeply moving moments, andsome wonderful slightly magical realist touches.  The cinematography is very good. But while lang does asurprisingly decent job, I can't help thinking a stronger, more experienced actress could have brought outeven more in this amazing role.That said, I did enjoy this much more on a second viewing.  While it bothered me that it felt at times likeAdlon was trying to simply re-create the magic of `Bagdad Caf&eacute;' (odd, surreal setting, quirky out of placecharacters, cinematography that uses color in exaggerated ways for effect, etc.) overall I foundmyself more able to just let go and accept this tale on its own merits.

Salmonberries is a less happy production, though it deals with a similar theme and an Alaskan equivalent setting.  The script and acting are awkward.  Oscar Kawagley, in his few minutes on screen, is the only sympathetic character.  The persistent German fascination with First Nations culture --- as usual over the top --- called for a pretty unflattering self portrayal by the Innu cast --- who in this movie are called ""Eskimos"".",2,"Worth a borrow, not worth buying",1326153600,"01 10, 2012",2012,560,"['loved', 'Percy', 'Adlon', 'Baghdad', 'Cafe', 'have', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'always', 'happily', 'eccentric', 'kindly', 'optimistic', 'Salmonberries', 'less', 'happy', 'production', 'similar', 'theme', 'Alaskan', 'equivalent', 'setting', 'script', 'acting', 'are', 'awkward', 'Oscar', 'Kawagley', 'few', 'minutes', 'screen', 'only', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'persistent', 'German', 'fascination', 'First', 'Nations', 'culture', 'usual', 'top', 'called', 'pretty', 'unflattering', 'self', 'portrayal', 'Innu', 'cast', 'who', 'movie', 'are', 'called', 'Eskimos']",N/A
