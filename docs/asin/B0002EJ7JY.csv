Now, the original gang was better than the College gang, but there are still many entertaining moments in the college years. I, for one, feel that the college years was cut way too short and thought it should have continued. I guess others didn't feel the same way though. Zack, Slater, and Screech are very entertaining in the college years and Leslie, Alex, and Kelly are good assets to the show. The theme of Zack still chasing Kelly never gets old and continues in the DVD set. If you are a fan of Saved by the Bell, I suggest the College Years to you.

It was rather short lived 19 episodes, but every episode was enjoyable and if you are a big fan of the show you will enjoy watching these episodes back to back to back.Zach, Kelly, Slater, and Screech are all freshman in college.  Kelly is roomates with two women Alex and Leslie.  Blonde hair Leslie is a girl from a wealthy family and Alex is just a silly young woman who dates Slater on the show. I can't understand why they put Slater with such an odd girl and she shares the comic relief role with Screech.My favorite episode of the show is the Thanksgiving episode.  There are a lot of celebrities that stop by the show, Marv Albert, Jonathon Brandis, Brian Austin Green, Jenna Von Oy, Marsha Warfield and Mr. Belding.Zach and Kelly are broke up but remain good friends.  The rekindling of their relationship starts heating up around the episode ""Dr. Kelly.""  Kelly expresses to Zach that she wants to be a doctor and he basically shoots her down so Kelly throws herself into her waitress job at a Hooter's like restaurant named Skeeters.  Zach offers Kelly kind words and they agree that they have ""chemistry.""

They were an ensemble that really worked!To me, this dvd is what it would be like if Seinfeld did a show where only Jerry and Elaine moved somewhere, left George and Kramer behind, and met new friends. Then, change elements about Jerry and Elaine that people enjoyed, and that is what the College Years are to me...As mentioned, Kelly is different-nothing like Kelly Kapowski from Bayside...I know people change, but I don't see any sort of similarity! Different hair, different style choices, different acting person...it is just weird!!Slater's niche is also taken away-he was the jock, and now falls to low status at the school..I know he is a new freshman, but...that takes away part of who his character was! Also, as mentioned, he is paired with Alex, who seems odd, and she doesn't have near the amount of charm as Elizabeth Berkley!There is more to say, but I don't want to bore (too much!) I am just pointing out that if you have not seen SBTB The College Years, and expect it to be just like Bayside and the kids there, you are in for a surprise! This doesn't make it a BAD show, but I was shocked to see the differences in these two shows...I thought that after not seeing the College Years since I was about 12, that these episodes would seem different to me now that I am older, but now I notice the differences all the more!I would recommend this dvd if you saw and liked The College Years originally, or are a Saved By The Bell collector (like myself)...otherwise, if you haven't seen the show, I would rent it (if possible!)",3,"Wow, I am surprised at the reviews!

But now as I look back, I can't believe how stupid the shows actually were. Notice how the show was always recorded in the same hallway, the same people were always together, the principal was nothing short of a moron, and the stories were as realistic as Elvis being alive.The College Years, while the critics may say otherwise, is clearly better than the high school episodes. Maybe it's because ""I was in college during the ""College Years"" but they really seem more entertaining to me and is definitely fun to watch if you're fan of no-brainer nonsense entertainment like me. Saved by the Bell is about ""stupid"" plotlines and loop holes of stories that really don't make sense, and that is what makes them fun.Although shortlived, the series was unlike it's high school counterpart. Alot has changed since Bayside. How convenient that Slater, Kelly, Zack and Screech all end up in the same dorm room together. Once again ""unrealistic craziness"" that the show survives on.  Too bad Lisa Turtle (Lark Voorhies) and Jessica Spano (Elisebeth Berkley) couldn't make it back, although lark does make a cameo toward the end of the series. ""Berkley was too busy taking her clothes off for the grammy award winning movie ""ShowGirls"". The series basically brings back Zack's non-sensical antics to college life at California Univeristy. Towards the end the story, the series focuses back on Zack and Kelly falling in love and then eventually talking about getting married. AC-Slater (Mario Lopez) really shines during the series and shows his fine acting abilities in a ""silly"" but sometimes serious way. Some newbie (nobodies) come around for the show and help it along the way too. Mark-Paul Gosselaar and the conflicts of college life really made me laugh throughout every episode. Every  tongue and cheek cliche' and trick to make 30 minutes go by is used up on every episode. Screech still ruins of the episodes better moments when the unrealistic feel of the show is brought out almost to the point of being absurd, but Zack, Slater and Kelly seem to keep the show at bay. It's too bad the show was cut, because some of the last episodes were getting a bit more serious and believable and I wanted more.Saved By The Bell: The College Years is a good DVD buy and people  who are like me, will watch it over and over, we just don't know why we watch it?",4,"Dumb, stupid, unrealistc, but amazingly, it's still fun.",1105920000,"01 17, 2005",2005,2528,"['Maybe', ""'m"", 'partial', 'series', 'Zack', 'Mark-Paul', 'Gosselaar', 'are', 'same', 'age', 'grew', 'up', '1st', 'series', 'too', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'now', 'look', 'back', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'stupid', 'shows', 'actually', 'were', 'Notice', 'how', 'show', 'was', 'always', 'recorded', 'same', 'hallway', 'same', 'people', 'were', 'always', 'together', 'principal', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'moron', 'stories', 'were', 'as', 'realistic', 'Elvis', 'being', 'alive.The', 'College', 'Years', 'critics', 'may', 'say', 'otherwise', 'clearly', 'better', 'high', 'school', 'episodes', 'Maybe', 'was', 'college', 'College', 'Years', 'really', 'seem', 'more', 'entertaining', 'definitely', 'fun', 'watch', ""'re"", 'fan', 'no-brainer', 'nonsense', 'entertainment', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'stupid', 'plotlines', 'loop', 'holes', 'stories', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'what', 'fun.Although', 'shortlived', 'series', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'counterpart', 'Alot', 'changed', 'Bayside', 'How', 'convenient', 'Slater', 'Kelly', 'Zack', 'Screech', 'end', 'up', 'same', 'dorm', 'room', 'together', 'Once', 'again', 'unrealistic', 'craziness', 'show', 'Too', 'bad', 'Lisa', 'Turtle', 'Lark', 'Voorhies', 'Jessica', 'Spano', 'Elisebeth', 'Berkley', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'back', 'lark', 'make', 'cameo', 'end', 'series', 'Berkley', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'taking', 'clothes', 'grammy', 'award', 'winning', 'movie', 'ShowGirls', 'series', 'basically', 'back', 'Zack', 'non-sensical', 'antics', 'college', 'life', 'California', 'Univeristy', 'end', 'story', 'series', 'back', 'Zack', 'Kelly', 'falling', 'love', 'then', 'eventually', 'talking', 'getting', 'married', 'AC-Slater', 'Mario', 'Lopez', 'really', 'series', 'fine', 'acting', 'abilities', 'silly', 'sometimes', 'serious', 'way', 'newbie', 'nobodies', 'come', 'show', 'help', 'way', 'too', 'Mark-Paul', 'Gosselaar', 'conflicts', 'college', 'life', 'really', 'made', 'episode', 'Every', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'cliche', 'trick', 'make', '30', 'minutes', 'go', 'used', 'up', 'episode', 'Screech', 'still', 'episodes', 'better', 'moments', 'when', 'unrealistic', 'feel', 'show', 'brought', 'out', 'almost', 'point', 'being', 'absurd', 'Zack', 'Slater', 'Kelly', 'seem', 'keep', 'show', 'bay', 'too', 'bad', 'show', 'was', 'cut', 'last', 'episodes', 'were', 'getting', 'bit', 'more', 'serious', 'believable', 'wanted', 'more.Saved', 'Bell', 'College', 'Years', 'good', 'DVD', 'buy', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'will', 'watch', 'over', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'watch']",Saved by the Bell: The College Years

It is a shame the uneducated will continue lumping in the earlier efforts with this product, because it is vastly superior.Finally graduated from Bayside, Zack, Kelly, Slater, and Screech all end up going to the fictional California University. Residing together in the world's cleanest dorm (sorry, these buildings are not actually that spotless) they meet new friends Leslie Burke (Anne Tremko) and Alex Taber (Kiersten Warren) and their goofy 'non traditional' RA Mike Rogers (Bob Golic) who is always around to dispense advice and the mild rebuke because Zack has not grown out of his scheming ways.Gosslear and Diamond especially look genuinely happy to have worked on this series. Having been in all of the incarnations of the STB empire, they've definently worked through cheese in the past. The now relaxed presentation of both actors makes each episode very enjoyable and akin to really soothing lip balm.Overall, I like this series much better than other teen shows 'college' efforts (oh....90210 comes to mind!) because the students actually go to classes, study, and are stressed about the above activities while trying to juggle a social life. Plus, even though they came from fairly posh homes, the rigors of college life quickly encourage these same students to adopt very casual oulfits.Again, the only concern is that each scene looks too spotless to actually take place in a 'big name' university. The students would not have time to keep their dorm that spotless if they were actually experiencing the frazzled nerves in the season.",4,Underrated effort,1088899200,"07 4, 2004",2004,1742,"['benefit', 'age', 'now', 'cringe', 'most', 'STB', 'empire', 'wonder', 'what', 'were', '1980', 'throwing', 'time', 'money', 'still', 'short-lived', 'college', 'years', 'shame', 'uneducated', 'will', 'continue', 'lumping', 'earlier', 'efforts', 'product', 'vastly', 'superior.Finally', 'graduated', 'Bayside', 'Zack', 'Kelly', 'Slater', 'Screech', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'fictional', 'California', 'University', 'Residing', 'together', 'world', 'cleanest', 'dorm', 'sorry', 'buildings', 'are', 'not', 'actually', 'spotless', 'meet', 'new', 'friends', 'Leslie', 'Burke', 'Anne', 'Tremko', 'Alex', 'Taber', 'Kiersten', 'Warren', 'goofy', 'traditional', 'RA', 'Mike', 'Rogers', 'Bob', 'Golic', 'who', 'always', 'around', 'dispense', 'advice', 'mild', 'rebuke', 'Zack', 'not', 'grown', 'scheming', 'ways.Gosslear', 'Diamond', 'especially', 'look', 'genuinely', 'happy', 'have', 'worked', 'series', 'Having', 'been', 'incarnations', 'STB', 'empire', ""'ve"", 'definently', 'worked', 'cheese', 'past', 'now', 'relaxed', 'presentation', 'actors', 'episode', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'akin', 'really', 'soothing', 'lip', 'balm.Overall', 'like', 'series', 'much', 'better', 'other', 'teen', 'shows', 'efforts', 'oh', '.90210', 'mind', 'students', 'actually', 'go', 'classes', 'study', 'are', 'stressed', 'above', 'activities', 'trying', 'juggle', 'social', 'life', 'even', 'came', 'fairly', 'posh', 'homes', 'rigors', 'college', 'life', 'quickly', 'encourage', 'same', 'students', 'adopt', 'very', 'casual', 'oulfits.Again', 'only', 'concern', 'scene', 'too', 'spotless', 'actually', 'take', 'place', ""'big"", 'name', 'university', 'students', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'keep', 'dorm', 'spotless', 'were', 'actually', 'experiencing', 'frazzled', 'nerves', 'season']",Saved by the Bell: The College Years

831746,A2NXAV1SNXWA9H,B0002EJ7JY,S. R.,"[7, 8]","This show is not looked upon favorably by some of the originalSaved by the Bellaficionados because of all of the changes that were made.  Zack is no longer top dog on campus, Kelly is is not so much sweet as she is sassy, Slater struggles to win wrestling matches, while Jesse & Lisa's replacements are not as well-defined.  Despite these differences, the show still manages to make the audience care for the struggles of four familiar characters (and some new ones) as they adjust to college life.  This series will undoubtedly hold a greater fondness for those who remember life in dorms, campus get-togethers with friends, and those boring professors who seem to make a lot more sense after college.  Granted, relationships on this show still never go beyond kissing, but the gang seems just as preoccupied with trying to prove that they are ready for adulthood.As the series progresses, so do the characters, which is not something that could be said of the original series.  Even though there were only 19 episodes, it was clear that each character was evolving and finding their particular niche in the social rung of society (as defined by college standards at least).  This is not to say that the students did not get into a fair share of trouble with the resident authority figure played by Bob Golic.  While he lacks the sweet gullibility of Mr.Belding, Golic still succeeds in walking that fine line between mentor and friend.This DVD set does not include any bonus features, although there are chapter stops for every episode enabling the viewer to skip to certain scenes (a basic feature lacking in the previous SBTB releases).  The 90 minuteWedding In Las Vegasmovie, which concluded the show's plotlines is available separately on DVD.  Overall, this is a great series that holds up much better in hindsight.
