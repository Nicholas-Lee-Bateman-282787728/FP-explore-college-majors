A quick recap of the story is in a small town, one of its town's people/patron becomes a celebrity and in her hometown she is idolized. Word is that she is returning back to her hometown soon for a visit and the whole town is up in arms with excitement for her return. Through this mayhem and madness of her return an outsider who was adopted named Dinky played by Wynona Ryder believes that Roxy is her true mother. That's my cliff notes version of the film. This truly is a hidden gem and one of Wynona's best performances when she was around her late teens/early 20's. This truly is a human interest story and a good coming of age film as well. This movie just has a magical quality about it that can't be explained and for some odd reason i can watch this movie over and over again. I always related to this film because of the fact that Dinky is an outsider and it seems everyone in town looks at her as if she is some sort of monster. Only a few people really find out some of the great qualities that she has to offer. On another note the music soundtrack to this film is awesome and has beautiful songs from Melissa Etheridge on it. If you haven't check this out you should or at least rent it.",5,"One of the BEST, A HIDDEN GEM!!!!",1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,1307,"['remember', 'watching', 'movie', 'when', 'i', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'was', 'always', 'HBO', 'everyday', 'seemed', 'A', 'quick', 'recap', 'story', 'small', 'town', 'one', 'town', 'people/patron', 'celebrity', 'hometown', 'idolized', 'Word', 'returning', 'back', 'hometown', 'soon', 'visit', 'whole', 'town', 'up', 'arms', 'excitement', 'return', 'mayhem', 'madness', 'return', 'outsider', 'who', 'was', 'adopted', 'named', 'Dinky', 'played', 'Wynona', 'Ryder', 'Roxy', 'true', 'mother', 'cliff', 'notes', 'version', 'film', 'truly', 'hidden', 'gem', 'one', 'Wynona', 'best', 'performances', 'when', 'was', 'around', 'late', 'teens/early', '20', 'truly', 'human', 'interest', 'story', 'good', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'just', 'magical', 'quality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'explained', 'odd', 'reason', 'i', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'over', 'again', 'always', 'related', 'film', 'fact', 'Dinky', 'outsider', 'everyone', 'town', 'looks', 'sort', 'monster', 'Only', 'few', 'people', 'really', 'find', 'out', 'great', 'qualities', 'offer', 'note', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'awesome', 'beautiful', 'songs', 'Melissa', 'Etheridge', 'have', ""n't"", 'check', 'should', 'least', 'rent']",N/A
1058733,A3CGH95G4EDJVT,B000NOIX70,A. ODELL,"[2, 2]","This is a great movie filled with both comedy and drama. Dinky (Winona Ryder)is a teenage girl struggling with issues like fitting in, making friends and discovering herself. She becomes inspired (and maybe even a little obsessed) with the town's local legend, Roxy Carmichael, who became famous when a song was written and dedicated to her. Now, Roxy is coming back to the small town, and the preparations are creating new hopes while, for some, drudging up painful memories. Jeff Daniels stars as Roxy's high school boyfriend who never fully got over her. If you've never seen this movie, it is definitely worth viewing.

She idolizes the only person that ever left town and became famous. Now the town is all aflutter because the famous Roxy Carmichael is coming back to visit.  Probably a good date movie.,4,An odd girl in a small town,1224028800,"10 15, 2008",2008,301,"['really', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'misfit', 'girl', 'small', 'town', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'character', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'only', 'person', 'ever', 'left', 'town', 'became', 'famous', 'Now', 'town', 'aflutter', 'famous', 'Roxy', 'Carmichael', 'coming', 'back', 'visit', 'Probably', 'good', 'date', 'movie']",N/A
1058735,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B000NOIX70,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[8, 8]","Winona Ryder stars as Dinky Bossetti, an awkward teenager in a small Ohio town called Clyde. The citizens of Clyde are in an uproar because one of their own, a woman named Roxy Carmichael, who left town 15 years before to take Hollywood by storm is returning for the first time. Dinky finds herself enthralled by Roxy and begins to ask everyone she can for information about the woman. Why Roxy is famous, why she left town, what she was like? The more answers Dinky gets to her questions, the more she finds herself convinced that Roxy is her long-lost mother and that when she comes back, she'll take Dinky back to Hollywood with her.Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael came out when I was 10 years old and I remember being completely in love with it. Winona Ryder is at her best as this misunderstood teen misfit who doesn't fit in with the kids in her school nor with her own family and has to look elsewhere to make a place for herself. Dinky's obsession with Roxy gives her a reason to belong and finally makes her feel like she might fit in somewhere. Almost 20 years later, this film is still as great as it was when I was a kid. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys those early 90's films about misanthropic teenagers and their coming-of-age.",4,"""It's good to want things""",1181433600,"06 10, 2007",2007,1257,"['Winona', 'Ryder', 'Dinky', 'Bossetti', 'awkward', 'teenager', 'small', 'Ohio', 'town', 'called', 'Clyde', 'citizens', 'Clyde', 'are', 'uproar', 'one', 'own', 'woman', 'named', 'Roxy', 'Carmichael', 'who', 'left', 'town', '15', 'years', 'take', 'Hollywood', 'storm', 'returning', 'first', 'time', 'Dinky', 'enthralled', 'Roxy', 'ask', 'everyone', 'can', 'information', 'woman', 'Why', 'Roxy', 'famous', 'why', 'left', 'town', 'what', 'was', 'more', 'answers', 'Dinky', 'questions', 'more', 'convinced', 'Roxy', 'long-lost', 'mother', 'when', 'back', ""'ll"", 'take', 'Dinky', 'back', 'Hollywood', 'her.Welcome', 'Home', 'Roxy', 'Carmichael', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'was', '10', 'years', 'old', 'remember', 'being', 'completely', 'love', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'best', 'misunderstood', 'teen', 'misfit', 'who', ""n't"", 'fit', 'kids', 'school', 'own', 'family', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'make', 'place', 'herself', 'Dinky', 'obsession', 'Roxy', 'reason', 'belong', 'finally', 'feel', 'might', 'fit', 'somewhere', '20', 'years', 'later', 'film', 'still', 'as', 'great', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'kid', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'early', '90', 'films', 'misanthropic', 'teenagers', 'coming-of-age']",N/A
