799721,A1ZAVMB4XZL8KA,B0001CKHR8,"Bookreader79424 ""I love Casa Ole!""","[7, 9]","This is an excellent children's movie. I saw it as a child myself when it first came on Nickelodeon (you know,  back in the stone age of the 80's?).Maureen Stapleton plays the ""Electric Grandmother"" who is a robot bought by an widower inventor for his children. The ""grandmother"" is extremely caring and friendly and it's hard to accept the fact that she's supposed to be none other than a robot, but anyhow, it's a good film about life and adjusting to new things.The father decides that his children need a maternal role figure. He goes to a factory where there's an elderly man, who specializes in making ""electrical grandmothers."" The children choose the eye colors, etc. until they have their very own version of a gradnmother.After the grandmother is built and sent to live with the children via helicopter, then the eldest child named Abigail decides she resents her new ""grandmother,"" so she acts like a spoiled brat throughout the film; although, you can't blame the character for reacting that way because after all, the child has just lost her mother, but eventually the little girl along with her fellow siblings learns to love her new ""grandmother,"" and sadly, the ""grandmother"" must be sent away because she's on borrowed time, which is probably symbolic of death, in a sense, and so the eldest child, Abigail gets upset, of course, (who wouldn't she's already lost her mother and now her ""grandmother""), so when the grandmother is getting ready to go into her box and leave via helicopter again, the little girl starts running away, visibly upset and then all the sudden a car comes whilring around the corner right before the little girl says to her ""grnadmother,"" ""Grandma, I hate you!"" Then, the grandmother  says, ""Abigail!"" Then, the grandmother gets run over after trying to prevent Abigail from getting hit, then everyone cries and then, (I cried as a child because I thought ""grandmother"" was dead) and lo and behold...she's alive!Eventually, the children grow up and the ""grandmother"" returns and takes care of them until their old age and the film ends.I highly recommend this to anyone, who has children, but be forewarned that death is a motif in this film, so it might not be suitable for younger viewers.It really should be released on DVD because it's a poignant family film.",5,"Delightful, fun, yet sad--all wrapped into one movie!",1137715200,"01 20, 2006",2006,2305,"['excellent', 'children', 'movie', 'saw', 'child', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'Nickelodeon', 'know', 'back', 'stone', 'age', '80', 'Stapleton', 'Electric', 'Grandmother', 'who', 'robot', 'bought', 'widower', 'inventor', 'children', 'grandmother', 'extremely', 'caring', 'friendly', 'hard', 'accept', 'fact', 'supposed', 'be', 'none', 'other', 'robot', 'anyhow', 'good', 'film', 'life', 'adjusting', 'new', 'things.The', 'father', 'children', 'need', 'maternal', 'role', 'figure', 'factory', 'where', 'elderly', 'man', 'who', 'making', 'electrical', 'grandmothers', 'children', 'choose', 'eye', 'colors', 'etc', 'have', 'very', 'own', 'version', 'gradnmother.After', 'grandmother', 'built', 'sent', 'live', 'children', 'helicopter', 'then', 'eldest', 'child', 'named', 'Abigail', 'new', 'grandmother', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'character', 'reacting', 'way', 'child', 'just', 'lost', 'mother', 'eventually', 'little', 'girl', 'fellow', 'siblings', 'love', 'new', 'grandmother', 'sadly', 'grandmother', 'must', 'be', 'sent', 'away', 'borrowed', 'time', 'probably', 'symbolic', 'death', 'sense', 'so', 'eldest', 'child', 'Abigail', 'upset', 'course', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'already', 'lost', 'mother', 'now', 'grandmother', 'so', 'when', 'grandmother', 'getting', 'ready', 'go', 'box', 'leave', 'helicopter', 'again', 'little', 'girl', 'starts', 'running', 'away', 'visibly', 'upset', 'then', 'sudden', 'car', 'whilring', 'corner', 'right', 'little', 'girl', 'grnadmother', 'Grandma', 'hate', 'Then', 'grandmother', 'Abigail', 'Then', 'grandmother', 'run', 'over', 'trying', 'prevent', 'Abigail', 'getting', 'hit', 'then', 'everyone', 'cries', 'then', 'cried', 'child', 'thought', 'grandmother', 'was', 'dead', 'behold', 'alive', 'Eventually', 'children', 'grow', 'up', 'grandmother', 'returns', 'care', 'old', 'age', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'children', 'be', 'forewarned', 'death', 'motif', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'younger', 'viewers.It', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'poignant', 'family', 'film']",Ray Bradbury's Electric Grandmother

Forget F 451, forget Something Wicked, forget Martian Chronicles...this is pure Ray Bradbury.  Electric Grandmother...just the tile rolls of your tongue so smoothly, and sounds so appealing, that you have to watch it.  It's dam* fine viewing entertainment as well.  Not really moving as some of these other reviewers tend to suggest, more corny than anything else.  But good nonetheless.  Good to watch in the same category as Fat Guy Goes Nutzoid or A Boy and His Dog.",4,Shame it's not on DVD,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,602,"['Even', 'similarities', 'tv', 'show', 'SMALL', 'WONDER', 'movie', 'DARYLL', 'abound', 'really', 'different', 'animal', 'altogether', 'Forget', 'F', '451', 'forget', 'Something', 'Wicked', 'forget', 'Martian', 'Chronicles', 'pure', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'Electric', 'Grandmother', 'just', 'tile', 'rolls', 'tongue', 'so', 'smoothly', 'so', 'appealing', 'have', 'watch', 'dam*', 'fine', 'viewing', 'entertainment', 'as', 'well', 'Not', 'really', 'moving', 'other', 'reviewers', 'tend', 'suggest', 'more', 'corny', 'anything', 'else', 'good', 'nonetheless', 'Good', 'watch', 'same', 'category', 'Fat', 'Guy', 'Goes', 'Nutzoid', 'A', 'Boy', 'Dog']",Ray Bradbury's Electric Grandmother

Very good music, great acting. This version is both touching, heartwarming, etc., AND it captures the sorta-dark-and-creepy vibe of Bradbury's original tale. Much better than the chopped-up, ham-handed Twilight Zone episode based on the same story.",5,Hurrah for Maureen!,1120435200,"07 4, 2005",2005,382,"['really', 'well-done', 'wonder', 'where', 'disappeared', 'days', 'Saw', 'school', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'never', 'forgotten', 'Very', 'good', 'music', 'great', 'acting', 'version', 'touching', 'heartwarming', 'etc.', 'sorta-dark-and-creepy', 'vibe', 'Bradbury', 'original', 'tale', 'Much', 'better', 'chopped-up', 'ham-handed', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'based', 'same', 'story']",Ray Bradbury's Electric Grandmother

As a child, I found some parts of it rather disturbing, such as when the family goes into Fantocinni's shop and you see the silhouettes and hear the distant voices of the grandmothers, when Grandma plugs herself into the wall and rocks back and forth and then the part where she seems like she should be dead, but is not.Second only to the strong performances by Maureen Stapleton, the music is what gives this movie its strength and character. The lullaby Grandma sings for Timothy and Agatha is beautiful and comforting.The best part of the movie is the last five minutes where you see the three siblings now all very old, staring out the window when Grandma returns, their faces and eyes lit up with happy memories of their childhood with her.I hope someday this movie is given a proper DVD release or at least a release of the soundtrack.

Although it is sci fi it is very believable and the acting is very good, expecially Maureen Stapleton.  I had another copy, but had lost it so I was very glad to get this one.  My only complaint, and the reason for only 4 stars, is the poor quality of the tape.  It almost seems like a dupe.
