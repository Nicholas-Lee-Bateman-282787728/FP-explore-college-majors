When I first watched this show, I was instantly hooked, the writing is comical, hilarious, and very frank. And how good is Tracee Ellis Ross? She is an amazing actress, she is too under-rated. I am so glad Girlfriends got picked up for an 8th season. This is one show that will not leave you disappointed, you will fall in love with every character, they are so different from one another and extremely special. Don't wait, purchase your copy of Girlfriends - The Second Season today.

This season has many strong storylines:*Joan & Toni's friendship problems culminating in one of the best shows of the season: TRICK OR TRUTH;*Maya's flirtation with a charming stranger jeopardizes her marriage;*William & Yvonne's relationship issues;*Lynne returns from the islands with Vosco and for once LYNNE is the responsible WORKING woman;*Toni opens her own real estate office &*Joan dates a younger manI love the chemistry between Tracee Ellis Ross, Jill Marie Jones, Golden Brooks, Persia White and Reggie Hayes and can't believe none of them, the show writers nor the show itself garnered any Emmies or major awards other than NAACP Image Awards.  Tracee & Jill Marie especially outdid themselves this season!The disc also has 2 really interesting extras - one details the making of the TRICK OR TRUTH episode and another which I especially enjoyed details how the actors were selected in addition to Mara Brock Akil speaking about the creation of the show.I'm sad that I didn't support this show fully while it aired but am so very grateful that the entire series is available on dvd so that I can enjoy watching it at my own pace without commercials.",5,Girlfriends - Season 2,1343260800,"07 26, 2012",2012,1320,"['did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'show', 'regularly', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'fell', 'love', 'when', 'BET', 'aired', 'marathon', 'missed', 'episodes', 'so', 'decided', 'buy', 'season', 'many', 'strong', 'storylines', '*Joan', 'Toni', 'friendship', 'problems', 'culminating', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'season', 'TRICK', 'OR', 'TRUTH', '*Maya', 'flirtation', 'charming', 'stranger', 'marriage', '*William', 'Yvonne', 'relationship', 'issues', '*Lynne', 'islands', 'Vosco', 'once', 'LYNNE', 'responsible', 'WORKING', 'woman', 'own', 'real', 'estate', 'office', '*Joan', 'younger', 'manI', 'chemistry', 'Tracee', 'Ellis', 'Ross', 'Jill', 'Marie', 'Jones', 'Golden', 'Brooks', 'Persia', 'White', 'Reggie', 'Hayes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'none', 'show', 'writers', 'show', 'garnered', 'Emmies', 'major', 'awards', 'other', 'NAACP', 'Image', 'Awards', 'Tracee', 'Jill', 'Marie', 'especially', 'season', 'disc', 'also', '2', 'really', 'interesting', 'extras', 'one', 'details', 'making', 'TRICK', 'OR', 'TRUTH', 'episode', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'details', 'how', 'actors', 'were', 'selected', 'addition', 'Mara', 'Brock', 'Akil', 'speaking', 'creation', 'show.I', ""'m"", 'sad', 'did', ""n't"", 'support', 'show', 'fully', 'aired', 'am', 'so', 'very', 'grateful', 'entire', 'series', 'available', 'dvd', 'can', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'own', 'pace', 'commercials']",Girlfriends: Season 2

1087310,A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL,B000SQFC1I,Little Miss Cutey,"[4, 4]","When this finally was released, I scooped up my copy and the next day, watched all episodes in one hit.  I love this show and this season is no let down.It has some great story lines here and some moments that make you cry (in Trick or Truth at the church).  I love Sister Sistah, Joans Birthday Suit and X Does Not Mark The Spot.  The other really great episode is Can't Stan Ya where Maya's 'friend' Stan threatens to tell her husband about their relationship.  He ends up in their house when Maya comes home one night and makes for a terrific storyline.The two things I really like about this show is firstly the comedy and having so many laughs throughout the series, but also the fact that these girls fight and have issues with each other, but ultimately they are always there for each other when things are bad.  When Joan was given X at a nightclub, the first thing she did was to get her date (who gave her the drug without her knowledge) to phone her girls.  If you don't have friends like these, this show hooks you in to their lives and if you do have friends like these then you related really well.  I cannot wait for the other seasons to come out and fully give this 5 stars because it's so fantastic.",5,Watched all episodes in one day ;-0,1195344000,"11 18, 2007",2007,1216,"['When', 'finally', 'was', 'released', 'scooped', 'up', 'copy', 'next', 'day', 'watched', 'episodes', 'one', 'hit', 'love', 'show', 'season', 'let', 'down.It', 'great', 'story', 'lines', 'here', 'moments', 'make', 'cry', 'Trick', 'Truth', 'church', 'love', 'Sister', 'Sistah', 'Joans', 'Birthday', 'Suit', 'X', 'Does', 'Not', 'Mark', 'Spot', 'other', 'really', 'great', 'episode', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Stan', 'Ya', 'where', 'Maya', ""'friend"", 'Stan', 'tell', 'husband', 'relationship', 'up', 'house', 'when', 'Maya', 'home', 'one', 'night', 'terrific', 'storyline.The', 'two', 'things', 'really', 'like', 'show', 'firstly', 'comedy', 'having', 'so', 'many', 'laughs', 'series', 'also', 'fact', 'girls', 'fight', 'have', 'issues', 'other', 'ultimately', 'are', 'always', 'there', 'other', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'bad', 'When', 'Joan', 'was', 'given', 'X', 'nightclub', 'first', 'thing', 'did', 'was', 'get', 'date', 'who', 'gave', 'drug', 'knowledge', 'phone', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'friends', 'show', 'lives', 'do', 'have', 'friends', 'then', 'related', 'really', 'well', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'other', 'seasons', 'come', 'out', 'fully', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'so', 'fantastic']",Girlfriends: Season 2
