1254677,A1ZSWL641H5018,B0027W6HBA,"Marie44 ""marie44""","[3, 3]","I'm surprised how many really good messages were packed into this film. There is a lot of goofing around with each other(especially among the brothers), but those worthwhile life messages come through clearly. After many years a will is about to be settled among some people who lost both their parents, but beyond that there are many side stories that imperfect people with difficult lives can relate to, even if the scene is supposed to be funny. It's really about a family and their various friends trying to connect with one another. What I like about this movie is that the decisions are often weighed, even if only in advice, with the words in the scriptures. There are characters with serious problems, including an encounter with CPS, but the characters--at least most of them--really care about each other and the sacrifices that are made to help others and simply to make peace are so inspiring. I was surprised by the ending, too, because these kind of movies usually have all problems resolved by the time the closing credits roll, but this one leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Still, by the principles most of the characters live by, you will probably get the feeling they will do just fine. The acting is good and the plot is even better. We've bought this to enjoy and to share with others.",5,Funny movie with serious messages,1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,1310,"[""'m"", 'surprised', 'how', 'many', 'really', 'good', 'messages', 'were', 'packed', 'film', 'lot', 'goofing', 'other', 'especially', 'brothers', 'worthwhile', 'life', 'messages', 'come', 'clearly', 'many', 'years', 'will', 'be', 'settled', 'people', 'who', 'lost', 'parents', 'are', 'many', 'side', 'stories', 'imperfect', 'people', 'difficult', 'lives', 'can', 'relate', 'even', 'scene', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'really', 'family', 'various', 'friends', 'trying', 'connect', 'one', 'What', 'like', 'movie', 'decisions', 'are', 'often', 'weighed', 'even', 'only', 'advice', 'words', 'scriptures', 'are', 'characters', 'serious', 'problems', 'including', 'encounter', 'CPS', 'characters', 'least', 'most', 'really', 'care', 'other', 'sacrifices', 'are', 'made', 'help', 'others', 'simply', 'make', 'peace', 'are', 'so', 'inspiring', 'was', 'surprised', 'ending', 'too', 'kind', 'movies', 'usually', 'have', 'problems', 'resolved', 'time', 'closing', 'credits', 'roll', 'one', 'lot', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'Still', 'principles', 'most', 'characters', 'live', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'feeling', 'will', 'do', 'just', 'fine', 'acting', 'good', 'plot', 'even', 'better', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'enjoy', 'share', 'others']",Bringing Up Bobby

1254682,A10UPYF30K74H0,B0027W6HBA,"Trinity Rose ""book lover""","[7, 7]","""Bringing Up Bobby"" is one of the funniest movies with a Christian theme that I've seen. My three youngest children, ages 19, 17 and 16 LOVED it and watched it over and over. You know how hard it is to get and keep a teenagers attention for very long, but this movie did that.The reason I like this movie besides the hilarious parts {which are all through the movie} is the Christianity that is a major theme. Some movies just stick about God or being a Christian in one part, but ""Bringing Up Bobby"" has Christianity from start to finish. This movie shows us you can have a riot in life, but still have Jesus at the center.""Bringing Up Bobby"" also is about reading wills, money, greed, child neglect, alcoholism and thinking you deserve everything. It also teaches even when things don't go your way you can still praise the Lord and keep on with a positive attitude.Bobby just turning 16 doesn't know what he believes so his older brother/caregiver challenges him to read the book of John and find out what he believes. For Bobby's 16 birthday his older brother and sister say they came back to celebrate with him, but we find out they came back for the reading of the will, which happens 12 years after the death of their parents. You won't believe all of the fun and trouble this family of four and their friends get into. It is so fun and wonderful to watch a movie that is full of love for the Lord and just side splitting laughs.The special features on this DVD are so cool. The film makers are two young brothers from OH, a great state. Outtakes, Home Movies from the set and Behind the scenes.I highly recommend this movie for one and all.""Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.
