The acting was bad, the story was suppose to be intricate, but it reeked of amateur/low budget sceenplay writing. The zombies were a mix of okay looking ones and cheeseball.. So why give this move five stars you may ask? Because it was funny as hell.. The main chatacter was a priest with a shady past, and the guy who plays him looks like a Hugh Jackman reject. In fact, this priest character is very much portrayed as a Wolverine type of guy.. He's a good guy now, but had a dark past and was an assassin.. He snarls like Jackman when he finally becomes all kick axe in the movie and is even refered to as a killing machine..lol.. It was like Priesterine, meets an angry prositute, meets a Jehovah's Witness, meets the cheeseball living dead, meets Days Of Our Lives. The whole movie just had a soap opera feel to it, and someohow remined me of a Days Of Our Lives episode as well. In fact, I could see the guy who played the Priest gracing the set of Days quite nicely.. The story does not come together well at all.. it's full of holes, crappy acting, grainy quality filming and Wolverine rip offs.. My head spins to think how some reviews said this was a good story and the characters seemed real, because neither was true in my book.. And the zombie action was not that great and not that much at times.. So again, why five stars???? Because I went to bed laughing and woke up the same way, with hysterical scenes of this movie playing through my head. I also walked away from this flick with a few good cheesey lines to say to family memebers and friends.. This is the kind of movie that you watch with other people and have your own Mystery Science Theatre moments.. It's good for nothing else, believe me.. Not even priesterine could save the day on this one...

1098673,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000V53C0O,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","&lt;strong>Awaken the Dead&lt;/strong> (Jeffrey McMichael Brookshire, 2007)&lt;em>Awaken the Dead&lt;/em> is a movie with an interesting premise, a script that would have been mediocire given one or two more rewrites with a professional editor sitting in, and some of the worst execution you are likely to ever see in a movie unless you go hunting for the bottom of the barrel like I do. There's really very little to do here but shake your head sadly and wait for a (hopefully loose) remake, since Hollywood eventually remakes everything these days.Plot: Father Gideon (&lt;em>Almost Famous&lt;/em>' Gary Kohn) is sent a message by an old employer asking him to go to their old meeting place and wait. When he does, he finds himself confronted by Mary (&lt;em>Chronicles of a Love Unfound&lt;/em>'s Lindsey Morris in her screen debut), who lives there, and who received a similar note telling him to wait--for what, neither is sure. The two of them are interrupted, first by a pair of door-to-door religioius proselytizers, then by a thug (&lt;em>Be Cool&lt;/em>'s Will Harris) who has a mysterious connection to Mary--but that is before the world goes insane. The inhabitants of the town, which was sprayed by a mysterious plane we see not long into the film, turn into zombies, etc. You know where to go from here. Stanley (&lt;em>Steampunk Samurai Biker Chick&lt;/em>'s Nate Witty), once of the Jehovah's Witnesses, pops back up on their doorstep with news of the outside world, and the three of them form an uneasy alliance aimed at figuring out what's going on--and where Jeremiah (&lt;em>The Last Bad Neighborhood&lt;/em>'s Michael Robert Nyman), Gideon's former employer, got off to instead of showing up at the house.I keep trying to come up with ways to make this pretty, and I just can't. You know from the second Gabriel and Mary (and aren't those names subtle?) are put together in that adversarial relationship that there's going to be a (badly-filmed) love scene. From the first time you see the two Asian schoolgirl zombies hanging around in the front yard while Grin's sitting in his car outside the house, you know where that scene is going. Etc. Characters suddenly appear out of (pretty much) nowhere and for no apparent reason, plot devices appear, shimmer briefly, and then fade into nothing, the actors seem as if they've been told to be as emotionaless as possible, and I think it was all filmed on a PXL-2000 that was (badly) jury-rigged to get some semblance of washed-out color. And yet underneath its bland, pale exterior it seems as if there was really something that could have come out of this, the brilliant fat kid stuck in the skinny wallflower's body. If only someone had figured out a way to feed this movie a few brownies. *",1,Gah.,1347235200,"09 10, 2012",2012,2761,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Awaken', 'Dead', 'lt', '>', 'Jeffrey', 'McMichael', 'Brookshire', '2007', 'lt', '>', 'Awaken', 'Dead', 'lt', '>', 'movie', 'interesting', 'premise', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'mediocire', 'given', 'one', 'two', 'more', 'rewrites', 'professional', 'editor', 'sitting', 'worst', 'execution', 'are', 'likely', 'ever', 'see', 'movie', 'go', 'hunting', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'do', 'really', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'here', 'shake', 'head', 'sadly', 'wait', 'hopefully', 'loose', 'remake', 'Hollywood', 'eventually', 'everything', 'days.Plot', 'Father', 'Gideon', 'lt', '>', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'lt', '>', 'Gary', 'Kohn', 'sent', 'message', 'old', 'employer', 'asking', 'go', 'old', 'meeting', 'place', 'wait', 'When', 'confronted', 'Mary', 'lt', '>', 'Chronicles', 'Love', 'Unfound', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Lindsey', 'Morris', 'screen', 'debut', 'who', 'there', 'who', 'received', 'similar', 'note', 'telling', 'wait', 'what', 'sure', 'two', 'are', 'interrupted', 'first', 'pair', 'door-to-door', 'religioius', 'proselytizers', 'then', 'thug', 'lt', '>', 'Be', 'Cool', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Will', 'Harris', 'who', 'mysterious', 'connection', 'Mary', 'world', 'insane', 'inhabitants', 'town', 'was', 'sprayed', 'mysterious', 'plane', 'see', 'not', 'long', 'film', 'turn', 'zombies', 'etc', 'know', 'where', 'go', 'here', 'Stanley', 'lt', '>', 'Steampunk', 'Samurai', 'Biker', 'Chick', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Nate', 'Witty', 'once', 'Jehovah', 'Witnesses', 'back', 'up', 'doorstep', 'news', 'outside', 'world', 'three', 'form', 'uneasy', 'alliance', 'aimed', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'where', 'Jeremiah', 'lt', '>', 'Last', 'Bad', 'Neighborhood', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Michael', 'Robert', 'Nyman', 'Gideon', 'former', 'employer', 'got', 'off', 'instead', 'showing', 'up', 'house.I', 'keep', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'ways', 'make', 'pretty', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'know', 'second', 'Gabriel', 'Mary', 'are', ""n't"", 'names', 'subtle', 'are', 'put', 'together', 'adversarial', 'relationship', 'going', 'be', 'badly-filmed', 'love', 'scene', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'two', 'Asian', 'schoolgirl', 'zombies', 'hanging', 'around', 'front', 'yard', 'Grin', 'sitting', 'car', 'house', 'know', 'where', 'scene', 'going', 'Etc', 'Characters', 'suddenly', 'appear', 'pretty', 'much', 'nowhere', 'apparent', 'reason', 'plot', 'devices', 'appear', 'shimmer', 'briefly', 'then', 'fade', 'nothing', 'actors', 'seem', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'be', 'as', 'emotionaless', 'possible', 'think', 'was', 'filmed', 'PXL-2000', 'was', 'badly', 'jury-rigged', 'get', 'semblance', 'washed-out', 'color', 'yet', 'underneath', 'bland', 'pale', 'exterior', 'was', 'really', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'brilliant', 'fat', 'kid', 'stuck', 'skinny', 'wallflower', 'body', 'only', 'someone', 'had', 'figured', 'out', 'way', 'feed', 'movie', 'few', 'brownies', '*']",Awaken the Dead

1098676,A2W82ICVTTYAOY,B000V53C0O,Zombob,"[13, 15]","Not bad, not bad at all...1) ACTING: For a low budget, no-name indie production, the acting was pretty good. The three main characters seemed very real to me and the script seem to flesh out their characters. There were, of course, the usual hit and misses when it comes to indie productions and quality actors, but nothing that really distracted me from the film.2) PRODUCTION: The script, I felt, was pretty strong. There were many plot lines going, and luckily for the viewer, they are all wrapped up at the end. A number of scenes were filmed with that grainy texture look which I personally do not care for, but to each his own. There was an original score by an actual band! How unusual for an indie! Normally, we, the viewers get some heavy metal music blaring through certain scenes, and this was a nice change of pace. I did have an issue with the sound. While viewing this movie, I was constantly adjusting the volume up and down. At times, I could hardly hear the actors, and then suddenly ZOMBIE ATTACK! and I was blown out of my chair. The zombie make up and gore was pretty good, but I felt, it could have /should have been more.3) THE ZOMBIES: Really nothing new brought to the zombie genre here.4) THE CAUSE: Experimental virus that transforms the living into the living dead.5) NUDITY: None.Overall, I feel that this was a pretty good entry for the low budget indie scene. Normally, we get the usual ""Zombies attack, the heroes fight to survive, and maybe, it's over."" This movie had a lot plot to keep you, the viewer interested in the movie. Is this movie top of the line, top notch zombie fare? No, there are a few problems, but nothing too extreme to take away from the viewer being entertained by this movie.
