1635911,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00BMXT8K2,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","Maybe I totally forgot... yeah, that must be it.  I remember watching Andrew Dice Clay back in 1996.  That was when I was becoming a teenager and my dad and his ex-girlfriend were debating if I was old enough to watch it.  I was 14.  They eventually gave in and let me see it... and I haven't been right since!  Now, 15 years later, he's back!  I had NO idea Andrew Dice Clay actually took time off from the big stage all these years.  I did often wonder what happened to him.  He had a sitcom I believe, and I'm pretty sure it never became much of a success.  Obviously he couldn't be himself on such a show, which means it was destined to fail.Anyway, if you're worried that Andrew Dice Clay has mellowed out in his old age, you are 100% wrong!  Indestructible shows a man STILL extremely talented, still remarkably inappropriate (for *all* age groups, hehe!) and still obsessed with sexual-related humor.  As we all are... and don't lie!  The sexual stuff is why you're watching this in the first place!  It's alright to admit it.  It's the reason I'm watching it too!Sex, the endless ways one can pleasure yourself, sperm in all its graphic gory details, all the private part interpretations and comparisons you can imagine... this is probably the best performance he's ever done.  It's *that* good.  It's INCREDIBLY offensive.  He picks on certain members of the audience which is always a good portion of any comedy routine, and he's pretty hard on them which means more laugh out loud moments for us.  Andrew touches on the subject of today's technology with emails, Anthony Weiner, and today's generation of excessively sex-hungry women.  The part about Twister (the board game) is a highlight, as is the viagra side effects if taken the wrong way (lol), but realistically the entire SHOW is a highlight!  You know what you're getting into with Andrew Dice Clay so there's no need for me to reiterate what you already know you sicko, hehe.Oh yeah, and the nursery rhymes.  He does that segment too!  Can't remember if these are the same exact jokes from years ago or slightly altered jokes.  They do sound familiar so I'm inclined to think they're the same jokes.  Also, this performance takes a few minutes to get underway since apparently his children are adults now and play the drums.  Be prepared for a slow start.  Overall, VERY funny, offensive, drop-off-your-couch-in-tears style of laughter that only Andrew Dice Clay can perform without missing a beat.  He's absolutely the funniest comedian whenever I'm in the mood for such filth!

1635916,A81P47EIXM8HA,B00BMXT8K2,"Richardson ""Clarence""","[2, 2]","I wasn't a big fan when Dice was a big thing. I was busy with life and the only comic I continued to follow from childhood was George Carlin. I did note the fanatical following but also the equally fanatical backlash. I ended up meeting him one day and realized what a nice family man he was and also that he had to be clever to create such a popular and polarizing character so I investigated,picked up some old CDs and DVDs and was entertained. I did notice a big fall off in quality after his big MSG show however, the DVDs after that really were bad imitations of his earlier act and even his shtick was a bit laughable. Being a big fan of comics I decided to give him another try and as you can see bought this from Amazon.com.I guess they plan on selling these at shows and through the mail only because it comes in a paper sleeve so thin you may not even believe a DVD is inside. the show is a bit slim as well coming in under 50 minutes ... with opening bits etc. BUT, it is a really funny funny show! Dice is very much like his better , younger self , but he's a bit self effacing throughout which is quite helpful and his treatment of his and in general men's aging is a fresh bit for him. While the Dice Rules DVDDice Rules: The Andrew Dice Clay Concert Movieis a coronation at the height of his popularity, this is by far the first worthy follow up and it was about 20 years in the making.If you were a fan I can recommend this without question. I can't give it 5 stars though .  It may be funny but it's short , there are no bonus features and the price isn't super cheap so its value for money ratio is very good not great. To compare, you can get Lawrence Of Arabia on Blu Ray with hours of bonus features for ten bucks and that is a stone cold 5 stars. It is well filmed and widescreen , definitely the best presentation he has had since his heyday of Madison Square Garden.If you only remember the dismal follow up DVDs and are tentative... take a chance you will enjoy it.",4,pleasantly surprised a very worthy follow up...,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,1990,"['was', ""n't"", 'big', 'fan', 'when', 'Dice', 'was', 'big', 'thing', 'was', 'busy', 'life', 'only', 'comic', 'continued', 'follow', 'childhood', 'was', 'George', 'Carlin', 'did', 'note', 'fanatical', 'following', 'also', 'equally', 'fanatical', 'backlash', 'ended', 'up', 'meeting', 'one', 'day', 'realized', 'what', 'nice', 'family', 'man', 'was', 'also', 'had', 'be', 'clever', 'create', 'popular', 'polarizing', 'character', 'so', 'investigated', 'picked', 'up', 'old', 'CDs', 'DVDs', 'was', 'entertained', 'did', 'notice', 'big', 'fall', 'off', 'quality', 'big', 'MSG', 'show', 'however', 'DVDs', 'really', 'were', 'bad', 'imitations', 'earlier', 'act', 'even', 'shtick', 'was', 'bit', 'laughable', 'Being', 'big', 'fan', 'comics', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'can', 'see', 'bought', 'Amazon.com.I', 'guess', 'plan', 'selling', 'shows', 'mail', 'only', 'paper', 'sleeve', 'so', 'thin', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'believe', 'DVD', 'inside', 'show', 'bit', 'slim', 'as', 'well', 'coming', '50', 'minutes', 'opening', 'bits', 'etc', 'BUT', 'really', 'funny', 'funny', 'show', 'Dice', 'very', 'much', 'better', 'younger', 'self', 'bit', 'self', 'effacing', 'quite', 'helpful', 'treatment', 'general', 'men', 'aging', 'fresh', 'bit', 'Dice', 'Rules', 'DVDDice', 'Rules', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'Concert', 'Movieis', 'coronation', 'height', 'popularity', 'far', 'first', 'worthy', 'follow', 'up', 'was', '20', 'years', 'making.If', 'were', 'fan', 'can', 'recommend', 'question', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'may', 'be', 'funny', 'short', 'are', 'bonus', 'features', 'price', ""n't"", 'super', 'cheap', 'so', 'value', 'money', 'ratio', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'compare', 'can', 'get', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'hours', 'bonus', 'features', 'ten', 'bucks', 'stone', 'cold', '5', 'stars', 'well', 'filmed', 'widescreen', 'definitely', 'best', 'presentation', 'had', 'heyday', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden.If', 'only', 'remember', 'dismal', 'follow', 'up', 'DVDs', 'are', 'tentative', 'take', 'chance', 'will', 'enjoy']",Andrew Dice Clay Indestructible
