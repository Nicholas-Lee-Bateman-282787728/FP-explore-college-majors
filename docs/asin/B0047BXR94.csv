1388305,AGAEJ9UBM8QWT,B0047BXR94,"Marty G. Price ""Gale Price""","[5, 5]","I am a definite fan of John Ford's work, from the beautiful backgrounds that highlight his westerns to depth of understanding that marks his most serious work. This collection includes one piece one would term 'serious,' ""Cheyenne Autumn."" The desperate flight of the Cheyenne group is seen largely through the sympathetic eye of Richard Widmark's army officer, with some divergence into a full third-person perspective (including sections with a voice-over) to fill out the events of the trek. The film is deeply moving, with curious flecks of comedy (the Dodge City episode) serving to highlight the absurdity of the American concern with persecuting a few starving Indians.""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" is a western standard, notable for John Wayne, Ben Johnson, and others 'doing their thing' and for the near-peaceful resolution of the immediate conflict. The location work is beyond compare, with the thunderstorm on the desert a highlight.""Wagon Master"" with Ben Johnson and Ward Bond is a particular gem -- another of those Ford pieces that extolls tolerance and universal values through a cowboy morality play. The pace is a bit laid-back, giving the piece a gentleness that is harshly interrupted by the violent intrusion of a band of murderous thieves. Johnson as the well-intentioned horse trader who serves as Wagon Master and Bond as the pragmatic, sensible leader of the colonists give the movie a great moral sense.The fourth movie, ""Three Godfathers,"" I fear has never really roused my interest, so I won't write on it.I will declare this collection a particularly 'good deal,' as all four films reflect Ford's great use of the western scene. One is a particularly strong movie; two others are ideal to casually watch and re-watch; I've nothing nasty to say about the fourth.",5,"Thank you, TCM",1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,1789,"['am', 'definite', 'fan', 'John', 'Ford', 'work', 'beautiful', 'backgrounds', 'highlight', 'westerns', 'depth', 'understanding', 'most', 'serious', 'work', 'collection', 'one', 'piece', 'one', 'would', 'term', ""'serious"", 'Cheyenne', 'Autumn', 'desperate', 'flight', 'Cheyenne', 'group', 'seen', 'largely', 'sympathetic', 'eye', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'army', 'officer', 'divergence', 'full', 'third-person', 'perspective', 'including', 'sections', 'voice-over', 'fill', 'out', 'events', 'trek', 'film', 'deeply', 'moving', 'curious', 'flecks', 'comedy', 'Dodge', 'City', 'episode', 'serving', 'highlight', 'absurdity', 'American', 'concern', 'persecuting', 'few', 'starving', 'Indians', 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'western', 'standard', 'notable', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'others', ""'doing"", 'thing', 'near-peaceful', 'resolution', 'immediate', 'conflict', 'location', 'work', 'compare', 'thunderstorm', 'desert', 'highlight', 'Wagon', 'Master', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'particular', 'gem', 'Ford', 'pieces', 'tolerance', 'universal', 'values', 'cowboy', 'morality', 'play', 'pace', 'bit', 'laid-back', 'giving', 'piece', 'gentleness', 'harshly', 'interrupted', 'violent', 'intrusion', 'band', 'murderous', 'thieves', 'Johnson', 'well-intentioned', 'horse', 'trader', 'who', 'Wagon', 'Master', 'Bond', 'pragmatic', 'sensible', 'leader', 'colonists', 'give', 'movie', 'great', 'moral', 'sense.The', 'fourth', 'movie', 'Three', 'Godfathers', 'fear', 'never', 'really', 'roused', 'interest', 'wo', ""n't"", 'write', 'it.I', 'will', 'declare', 'collection', 'particularly', ""'good"", 'deal', 'four', 'films', 'reflect', 'Ford', 'great', 'use', 'western', 'scene', 'One', 'particularly', 'strong', 'movie', 'two', 'others', 'are', 'ideal', 'casually', 'watch', 're-watch', ""'ve"", 'nothing', 'nasty', 'say', 'fourth']",TCM Greatest Classic Film Collection: Legends - John Ford (She Wore a Yellow Ribbon / Three Godfathers / Cheyenne Autumn / Wagon Master)

He launched the careers of many stars, not just John Wayne.  But in 'She Wore A Yellow Ribbon' he created what I feel the greatest movie about the U.S. Cavalry versus the Indians.  And John Wayne is at his greatest as Captain Nathan Brittles.  Many critics feel that John Wayne's academy award for True Grit came because he didn't get it in his better movies of which this is one.  'The Three Godfathers' another great story told with four very good actors in John Wayne, Pedro Armendirez (spelling may not be right), Harry Carey Jr and Ward Bond help make this John Ford Western well worth watching.  Another great story based on history is the movie Cheyenne Autumn and with Richard Widmark among others in this movie another great watch.  I got this set because the three movies I just mentioned at the price I paid made it irresistable to buy.  I had not recalled the movie Wagon master or the one time I had seen it back in the 1960's but it is a good movie with Ward Bond, Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr.  I strongly recommend this set for any Western movie fan among others who might want it for two good John Wayne movies along with two good other movies.",5,Well worth the money,1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,1262,"['John', 'Ford', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'directors', 'Westerns', 'War', 'Movies', ""'ve"", 'had', 'long', 'time', 'launched', 'careers', 'many', 'stars', 'not', 'just', 'John', 'Wayne', ""'She"", 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'created', 'what', 'feel', 'greatest', 'movie', 'U.S.', 'Cavalry', 'Indians', 'John', 'Wayne', 'greatest', 'Captain', 'Nathan', 'Brittles', 'Many', 'critics', 'feel', 'John', 'Wayne', 'academy', 'award', 'True', 'Grit', 'came', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'movies', 'one', 'Three', 'Godfathers', 'great', 'story', 'told', 'four', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Pedro', 'Armendirez', 'spelling', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'right', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'help', 'make', 'John', 'Ford', 'Western', 'well', 'watching', 'great', 'story', 'based', 'history', 'movie', 'Cheyenne', 'Autumn', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'others', 'movie', 'great', 'watch', 'got', 'set', 'three', 'movies', 'just', 'mentioned', 'price', 'paid', 'made', 'irresistable', 'buy', 'had', 'not', 'recalled', 'movie', 'Wagon', 'master', 'one', 'time', 'had', 'seen', 'back', '1960', 'good', 'movie', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'set', 'Western', 'movie', 'fan', 'others', 'who', 'might', 'want', 'two', 'good', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movies', 'two', 'good', 'other', 'movies']",TCM Greatest Classic Film Collection: Legends - John Ford (She Wore a Yellow Ribbon / Three Godfathers / Cheyenne Autumn / Wagon Master)
1388309,A2EW64WI4R74Z8,B0047BXR94,RestlessBoomer,"[2, 2]","I bought this 4-movie set primarily for Wagon Master and 3 Godfathers having seen neither of them.  All four movies are classic John Ford westerns and are all good in their own way.Wagon Master is the only one in black and white but Ben Johnson, Ward Bond, and Harry Carey Jr. make you forget all about that.  The scenery is spectacular and the plot was decent: Mormons being driven out of one town to settle in another area.  Ben Johnson is always a treat to watch as he was a true, honest-to-goodness cowboy and it shows in every movie he was in.  Harry Carey Jr. is perfect as his sidekick and Ward Bond is the crusty, short-tempered Mormon leading the wagon train.  All in all, a good actioner.3 Godfathers is a departure from regular westerns.  Three friends who have robbed a bank and are running from the law come across a woman who's about to give birth.  She entrusts the baby to them and the story goes from there.  The movie was made in 1948 and introduces Harry Carey Jr. as one of the friends with John Wayne and Pedro Armendariz as the other two.  Ward Bond is the sheriff on their trail.  There's not a lot of action per se as this is more of a character study western than a shoot-'em-up.  The film was dedicated to the late Harry Carey (H.C. Jr's dad) which was a nice touch.Cheyenne Autumn was Ford's last western and it kind of showed.  This could have (and should have) been a wonderful homage to the spirit of the American Indian but turned into a narration about a long walking journey across desolate (but beautiful) country.  (Note: if you watch 3 Godfathers and Cheyenne Autumn back-to-back be sure to have plenty of water, iced tea or something equally refreshing to drink because you'll get really thirsty just watching these poor people walk in all that dust and sand blowing around!)  Lots of big name stars in this one including Sal Mineo (who doesn't speak one word of English), Karl Malden, Edward G. Robinson, Richard Widmark, Carroll Baker, Ricardo Montalban, etc.  Cheyenne Autumn could have been cut significantly in time by completely leaving out the entire segment which took place in Dodge City.  It didn't really belong in the film and just seemed ""cut and pasted"" in.  Jimmy Stewart, Arthur Kennedy and John Carradine were TOTALLY wasted in their roles.  I can't imagine what possessed any of them to agree to be in this film playing the roles they were given.  The whole thing was just silly and annoying.  I hit the ""skip"" button, bypassed the intermission and went right into the next segment.She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is probably the best known of the four movies, so I won't go into it more than to say it's a very good vehicle for John Wayne, it's got a good storyline and, as a whole, is a very good action western.My main complaint with John Ford's westerns is his insistence on shoving corny comedy into each one.  His movies would flow much better without the funny business.  To me, it just has no place in a western.  I don't mind a few funny lines here and there but comedy for the sake of comedy just seems to bog the whole thing down and it becomes annoyingly disjointed.  But, that's just me.As a whole, this is a good collection to get--each movie is good in its own way.",4,"All in all, a good bargain",1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,3228,"['bought', '4-movie', 'set', 'primarily', 'Wagon', 'Master', '3', 'Godfathers', 'having', 'seen', 'four', 'movies', 'are', 'classic', 'John', 'Ford', 'are', 'good', 'own', 'way.Wagon', 'Master', 'only', 'one', 'black', 'white', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'make', 'forget', 'scenery', 'spectacular', 'plot', 'was', 'decent', 'Mormons', 'being', 'driven', 'one', 'town', 'settle', 'area', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'always', 'treat', 'watch', 'was', 'true', 'honest-to-goodness', 'cowboy', 'movie', 'was', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'perfect', 'sidekick', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'crusty', 'short-tempered', 'Mormon', 'leading', 'wagon', 'train', 'good', 'actioner.3', 'Godfathers', 'departure', 'regular', 'westerns', 'Three', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'robbed', 'bank', 'are', 'running', 'law', 'come', 'woman', 'who', 'give', 'birth', 'baby', 'story', 'there', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1948', 'introduces', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'one', 'friends', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Pedro', 'Armendariz', 'other', 'two', 'Bond', 'sheriff', 'trail', 'not', 'lot', 'action', 'per', 'se', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'western', ""shoot-'em-up"", 'film', 'was', 'dedicated', 'late', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'H.C.', 'Jr', 'dad', 'was', 'nice', 'touch.Cheyenne', 'Autumn', 'was', 'Ford', 'last', 'western', 'kind', 'showed', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'homage', 'spirit', 'American', 'Indian', 'turned', 'narration', 'long', 'walking', 'journey', 'desolate', 'beautiful', 'country', 'Note', 'watch', '3', 'Godfathers', 'Cheyenne', 'Autumn', 'back-to-back', 'be', 'sure', 'have', 'plenty', 'water', 'iced', 'tea', 'something', 'equally', 'refreshing', 'drink', ""'ll"", 'get', 'really', 'thirsty', 'just', 'watching', 'poor', 'people', 'walk', 'dust', 'sand', 'blowing', 'around', 'Lots', 'big', 'name', 'stars', 'one', 'including', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'who', ""n't"", 'speak', 'one', 'word', 'English', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'Edward', 'G.', 'Robinson', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'etc', 'Cheyenne', 'Autumn', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'significantly', 'time', 'completely', 'leaving', 'out', 'entire', 'segment', 'took', 'place', 'Dodge', 'City', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'belong', 'film', 'just', 'seemed', 'cut', 'pasted', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Arthur', 'Kennedy', 'John', 'Carradine', 'were', 'TOTALLY', 'wasted', 'roles', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'what', 'possessed', 'agree', 'be', 'film', 'playing', 'roles', 'were', 'given', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'just', 'silly', 'annoying', 'hit', 'skip', 'button', 'bypassed', 'intermission', 'went', 'right', 'next', 'segment.She', 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'four', 'movies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'more', 'say', 'very', 'good', 'vehicle', 'John', 'Wayne', 'got', 'good', 'storyline', 'whole', 'very', 'good', 'action', 'western.My', 'main', 'complaint', 'John', 'Ford', 'westerns', 'insistence', 'shoving', 'corny', 'comedy', 'one', 'movies', 'would', 'flow', 'much', 'better', 'funny', 'business', 'just', 'place', 'western', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'few', 'funny', 'lines', 'here', 'there', 'comedy', 'sake', 'comedy', 'just', 'bog', 'whole', 'thing', 'down', 'annoyingly', 'disjointed', 'just', 'me.As', 'whole', 'good', 'collection', 'get', 'movie', 'good', 'own', 'way']",TCM Greatest Classic Film Collection: Legends - John Ford (She Wore a Yellow Ribbon / Three Godfathers / Cheyenne Autumn / Wagon Master)
