1370567,A2RVCF21L2NPU5,B003XI167W,"Cherise Kachelmuss ""Mom and More""","[33, 34]","This box set is perfect for Thomas & Friends both old and new.  My boys just recently got into Thomas so they haven't seen really any of the older episodes which this box set has discs ranging from 2001-2008.  Each disc has episodes focusing on a certain character or just the best of!  There are over 50 episodes total and each disc is between 40-60 minutes long.  Luckily my boys aren't too picky yet and love all the engines equally, but for kids who are specific or especially families with two kids who like different engines, this would be a great set.  The episodes are classic Thomas & Friends episodes and I love that there are so many episodes in one set!  For just $24 on Amazon, that is like $.50 an episode that you can watch over and over again!",5,Lots of Thomas & Friends!,1288742400,"11 3, 2010",2010,759,"['box', 'set', 'perfect', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'old', 'new', 'boys', 'just', 'recently', 'got', 'Thomas', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'really', 'older', 'episodes', 'box', 'set', 'discs', 'ranging', '2001-2008', 'disc', 'episodes', 'focusing', 'certain', 'character', 'just', 'best', 'are', '50', 'episodes', 'total', 'disc', '40-60', 'minutes', 'long', 'Luckily', 'boys', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'picky', 'yet', 'love', 'engines', 'equally', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'specific', 'especially', 'families', 'two', 'kids', 'who', 'like', 'different', 'engines', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'set', 'episodes', 'are', 'classic', 'Thomas', 'Friends', 'love', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'one', 'set', 'just', '24', 'Amazon', '.50', 'episode', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'again']",N/A

But as each ""Best of"" DVD is pretty hard to find now, and you only have the VHS copies of these shows, then this set is for you.  The picture quality is leaps ahead of the old VHS tapes (naturally) which we had to rent from the library.  There are 6 discs in this set, many of which I couldn't even find individually on Amazon anymore.  The price is great, the quality is great, and most of all, the content is preserved.  It's great to hear Ringo Starr and George Carlin doing their premier voice work for this series.
