1096076,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B000UR9QTO,Caleb Williams,"[7, 7]","I got this movie as part of the Amazon Vine program in the UK, it was one of those moments where you simply just select an item because it's free and you know that you only have to write a review for it afterwards. I chose this movie as it starred Hayden Panettiere and I've become a fan of her acting from her role as Clare in the hit TV series Heroes. I have to admit that I didn't expect much, I expected a low budget movie with very little acting talent (with the exception of Hayden & Leung of course.) I was extremely surprised as I was given much, much more than I had expected. I was given a love movie that set the standard for which all other movies should try to aim for, it was intelligent, funny and heartwarming. The characters were believable and portrayed those who faced a genuine struggle, not only with their heart but with their identity; at least that's the struggle that faces Ken Leungs character, Liam Liu.The story revolves around a struggling American Asian actor called Liam Liu, one day after being rejected from an audition for a toothpaste commercial he's forced to ride the bus home as his car was towed due to unpaid parking tickets. While on the bus he meets a flirty, sweet and intelligent teenager called Adelaide and they quickly become friends but although ""Addy"" looks at Liam as her Boyfriend he doesn't feel that way, or at least he thinks he doesn't. One day he receives a call from his alcoholic Father to inform him that his grandmother has died and left him her $500,000 house in Shanghai. He goes over there with the intention of selling the house, but while there he falls in love with the house and a new girl called Micki Yang.  While living in China he discovers more about his true culture and identity that he ever thought he would, but he can't help but feel that his heart is still in the USA with Addy.I absolutely loved this movie and I'm glad I gave it a chance, if you've never heard of it before or you're not the type of person to check out a pretty unknown movie then please take my strong recommendation for this one as you wont be disappointed.",5,A Beautiful Movie About Love And Identity,1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,2106,"['got', 'movie', 'part', 'Amazon', 'Vine', 'program', 'UK', 'was', 'one', 'moments', 'where', 'simply', 'just', 'select', 'item', 'free', 'know', 'only', 'have', 'write', 'review', 'chose', 'movie', 'starred', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', ""'ve"", 'become', 'fan', 'acting', 'role', 'Clare', 'hit', 'TV', 'series', 'Heroes', 'have', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'expected', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'acting', 'talent', 'exception', 'Hayden', 'Leung', 'course', 'was', 'extremely', 'surprised', 'was', 'given', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'had', 'expected', 'was', 'given', 'love', 'movie', 'set', 'standard', 'other', 'movies', 'should', 'try', 'aim', 'was', 'intelligent', 'funny', 'heartwarming', 'characters', 'were', 'believable', 'portrayed', 'who', 'faced', 'genuine', 'struggle', 'not', 'only', 'heart', 'identity', 'least', 'struggle', 'Ken', 'Leungs', 'character', 'Liam', 'Liu.The', 'story', 'around', 'struggling', 'American', 'Asian', 'actor', 'called', 'Liam', 'Liu', 'one', 'day', 'being', 'rejected', 'audition', 'toothpaste', 'commercial', 'forced', 'ride', 'bus', 'home', 'car', 'was', 'towed', 'due', 'unpaid', 'parking', 'tickets', 'bus', 'flirty', 'sweet', 'intelligent', 'teenager', 'called', 'Adelaide', 'quickly', 'become', 'friends', 'Addy', 'Liam', 'Boyfriend', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way', 'least', ""n't"", 'One', 'day', 'call', 'alcoholic', 'Father', 'inform', 'grandmother', 'died', 'left', '500,000', 'house', 'Shanghai', 'intention', 'selling', 'house', 'love', 'house', 'new', 'girl', 'called', 'Micki', 'Yang', 'living', 'China', 'more', 'true', 'culture', 'identity', 'ever', 'thought', 'would', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'heart', 'still', 'USA', 'Addy.I', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'gave', 'chance', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', ""'re"", 'not', 'type', 'person', 'check', 'out', 'pretty', 'unknown', 'movie', 'then', 'please', 'take', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'one', 'wont', 'be', 'disappointed']",Shanghai Kiss

The scenes set in Shanghai are excellent and really give you a contrast to to the LA lifestyle. The Chinese actors also act the 'American' actors off the screen.This film tries to pack a lot in and some scenes suffer as a result (like a 1 minute Triad boyfriend thrown into the mix) but is is full of quirky dialogue which makes these vignettes enjoyable. It does seem fast paced as the story moves around so much.It is an intelligent 'love' film with a Chinese American man deciding between life in China with an older intelligent Chinese partner or a younger quirky all American girl. His U.S love interest is played by now famous for 'Heroes' Hayden Panettiere who is a cross between an all singing and dancing Minnie Mouse and an urber perky, quirky Elle from 'Legally Blonde'. Very peculiar role to act but she does it well.Why only 3 stars? Mostly because I didn't find the main character at all likeable even when he did something extremely generous. Much of the early film points out what a serial one night stand mentality he has. Some of the situations and scenes seemed terribly contrived and unbelievable and because this film manages to pack so much in nothing is gone into for much time. Ideas are revisited - auditioning for commercials, selling houses to illustrate changes in the main character and everything turns full circle so it is a very complete and well constructed story. It just jumps around too much for my liking.I think this film will appeal mainly to older teenagers who appreciate the teenage puppy love of Hayden Panettiere's character and the finding a place in the world angst of her older love interest.",3,A Tale of Two Cities,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,1743,"['much', 'like', 'film', 'loved', 'Translation', 'well', 'look', 'scenes', 'set', 'Shanghai', 'are', 'excellent', 'really', 'give', 'contrast', 'LA', 'lifestyle', 'Chinese', 'actors', 'also', 'act', ""'American"", 'actors', 'screen.This', 'film', 'tries', 'pack', 'lot', 'scenes', 'suffer', 'result', '1', 'minute', 'Triad', 'boyfriend', 'thrown', 'mix', 'full', 'quirky', 'dialogue', 'vignettes', 'enjoyable', 'seem', 'fast', 'paced', 'story', 'around', 'so', 'much.It', 'intelligent', ""'love"", 'film', 'Chinese', 'American', 'man', 'deciding', 'life', 'China', 'older', 'intelligent', 'Chinese', 'partner', 'younger', 'quirky', 'American', 'girl', 'U.S', 'love', 'interest', 'played', 'now', 'famous', ""'Heroes"", 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'who', 'cross', 'singing', 'dancing', 'Minnie', 'Mouse', 'urber', 'perky', 'quirky', 'Elle', ""'Legally"", 'Blonde', 'Very', 'peculiar', 'role', 'act', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'Mostly', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'main', 'character', 'likeable', 'even', 'when', 'did', 'something', 'extremely', 'generous', 'Much', 'early', 'film', 'points', 'out', 'what', 'serial', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'mentality', 'situations', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'terribly', 'contrived', 'unbelievable', 'film', 'pack', 'so', 'much', 'nothing', 'gone', 'much', 'time', 'Ideas', 'are', 'revisited', 'auditioning', 'commercials', 'selling', 'houses', 'illustrate', 'changes', 'main', 'character', 'everything', 'turns', 'full', 'circle', 'very', 'complete', 'well', 'constructed', 'story', 'just', 'jumps', 'around', 'too', 'much', 'liking.I', 'think', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'mainly', 'older', 'teenagers', 'who', 'appreciate', 'teenage', 'puppy', 'love', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'character', 'finding', 'place', 'world', 'angst', 'older', 'love', 'interest']",Shanghai Kiss
1096079,AAVK7KV7E08ZD,B000UR9QTO,"Don from SF ""coach41""","[9, 15]","Shanghai Kiss - An independent Asian American film that played throughout the US in film festivals gets a home DVD release.  SPOILERS BELOW if you haven't seen the film:I watched the film at the Asian American Fi;m Festival this past March (2007) and came away with an uneven impression.  Ken Leung (now of ""Lost"", also X-Men 3, Rush Hour) is a struggling actor who gets into a somewhat convoluted relationship with the lovely Hayden Panettiere when they meet on the bus.  Leung doesn't seem to think Hayden is his GF but yet they spend a lot of time together.Things change when Leung inherits a house in Shanghai where he later moves back to.  Leung leaves behind Hayden and runs into Kelly Hu (how lucky can a guy get....hahahahah).However, in the end, Leung decides the US is his home and he returns.  Hayden and Leung do split apart, but eventually re-unite a year later.The unevenness is the portrayal of the characters ages.  Leung is 35+ in real life and is probably late 20's early 30's in the movie.  Hayden is 18 and plays a high school kid in the movie.  While it is not impossible for a young impressionable teenager to fall in ""love"" with an older man, it did make the story very awarkward for me personally.However, besides the story, the acting was fairly solid.  Leung played his usual brooding self well in the film.  Hayden was lovely as always and acted her age throughout the film.  Kelly Hu has matured greatly with age.  She looks better now than in her days when she was on ""Martial Law"" and she portrayed her character fairly well too.All in all, an interesting if uneven film worth at least a rental.  It should attract some interest due to the actors and actresses in the film.  Fans of Hu and Hayden will definitely stop by and see the two lovely ladies in action.  Leung's popularity will grow due to his ""Lost"" exposure.  Some people may accidentally stumble upon this due to ""Lost"".",3,Interesting but uneven film,1191542400,"10 5, 2007",2007,1912,"['Shanghai', 'Kiss', 'independent', 'Asian', 'American', 'film', 'played', 'US', 'film', 'festivals', 'home', 'DVD', 'release', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'watched', 'film', 'Asian', 'American', 'Fi', 'Festival', 'past', 'March', '2007', 'came', 'away', 'uneven', 'impression', 'Ken', 'Leung', 'now', 'Lost', 'also', 'X-Men', '3', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'struggling', 'actor', 'who', 'somewhat', 'convoluted', 'relationship', 'lovely', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'when', 'meet', 'bus', 'Leung', ""n't"", 'seem', 'think', 'Hayden', 'GF', 'yet', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'together.Things', 'change', 'when', 'Leung', 'house', 'Shanghai', 'where', 'later', 'back', 'Leung', 'Hayden', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'how', 'lucky', 'can', 'guy', 'get', '.hahahahah', '.However', 'end', 'Leung', 'US', 'home', 'Hayden', 'Leung', 'do', 'split', 'apart', 'eventually', 're-unite', 'year', 'later.The', 'unevenness', 'portrayal', 'characters', 'ages', 'Leung', '35+', 'real', 'life', 'probably', 'late', '20', 'early', '30', 'movie', 'Hayden', '18', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'movie', 'not', 'impossible', 'young', 'impressionable', 'teenager', 'fall', 'love', 'older', 'man', 'did', 'make', 'story', 'very', 'awarkward', 'personally.However', 'story', 'acting', 'was', 'fairly', 'solid', 'Leung', 'played', 'usual', 'brooding', 'self', 'well', 'film', 'Hayden', 'was', 'lovely', 'always', 'acted', 'age', 'film', 'Kelly', 'Hu', 'matured', 'greatly', 'age', 'better', 'now', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'Martial', 'Law', 'portrayed', 'character', 'fairly', 'well', 'too.All', 'interesting', 'uneven', 'film', 'worth', 'least', 'rental', 'should', 'attract', 'interest', 'due', 'actors', 'actresses', 'film', 'Fans', 'Hu', 'Hayden', 'will', 'definitely', 'stop', 'see', 'two', 'lovely', 'ladies', 'action', 'Leung', 'popularity', 'will', 'grow', 'due', 'Lost', 'exposure', 'people', 'may', 'accidentally', 'stumble', 'due', 'Lost']",Shanghai Kiss
1096080,A3P6V42BGACXSA,B000UR9QTO,M. MOUA,"[1, 17]","This movie is about Liam, a late 20ish Chinese-American male who is struggling to become an actor in LA, CA. On a bus ride home, a 16-year-old High School girl, Adelaide, decides to talk to him and eventually sang a song for him. From there on, there relationship builds through out the movie. He drives her to places, school, movies and she considers him her boyfriend. Despite his protest about them being a couple, yet he continues this weird relationship with her.Liam receives a call from his father that his grandmother had passed away in Shanghai, China and that she left him her home. Thinking he'll just go there and sell the house and return back to the US. Once he got there, he meets a Chinese girl and falls in love with her. Not alone did he fall in love with her; it's the first time he felt he belongs. He felt normal. Just not another Chinese person but just another person. He thinks about staying after all and returns home to say good-bye to everyone including Adelaide. After awhile, he realize that China is not all its crack up to be and returns back to the states in hope for a shot at getting Adelaide back and find true love.Being an Asian American who was born in the old country and raise in America. I can understand where he is coming from....the point of not belonging in either ""world"". Not Asian enough and not American enough due to the skin of my color and the two cultures that I was raised by my family and by my environment. I can also relate about Asian males portray and stereotyped in Hollywood movies. Asian males can never be a lead actor, the guy who gets the girl....blah, blah, blah. For the life of me, I never could understand how Hollywood thinks Asian males can't find a date or that they are undesirable. I never had a problem dating and never once knew any of my friends having a hard time finding a woman.But what I find about this movie is quite disturbing and creepy at the same time. Liam is pretty much a Pedophile. A Child Predator, the ones that you see in NBC's Dateline ""How to catch a Predator"". How does one find a late 20ish male with a 16-year-old girl as romantic is beyond me. Anyone think that it's a sweet movie needs to have their heads exam. The only thing waiting for a late 20ish male knocking on my door to go on a date with my 16-year-old daughter is going to get a loaded shotgun pointed at his face.Yes, finally an Asian male actor finally gets his girl....Ooops....Somehow someone bleeps it up again and makes him a child molester. I don't know about you.

She in a way solved a lot of his life problems. Liam being with her made him helped a big life problem he had with his dad. Being with her helped him realized that he doesn't appreciate women general and he then figured out how much he doesn't feel alone when he is with her.At the end, Liam has to really wait for Adelaide to turn 18 to start any kind of adult relationship, but that's okay with them both.

1096085,A3P222CN9HAPTF,B000UR9QTO,"Steve Benner ""Stonegnome""","[0, 2]","As a 'journey of self-discovery' story, ""Shanghai Kiss"" feels to take a few false turns along the way from its refreshingly different start to its entirely predictable ending. While there is much about this production to like, with some genuinely funny as well as moving moments, it suffers in the end from its own uncertainty--mounting to a total confusion at times--as to whether to be serious or funny, resulting in it failing to be either most of the time.  And while the music is well chosen, and the cinematography, especially the city-scapes of Shanghai, visually stunning, the cast mostly comes over as being capable of stronger performances than either the story or the script permit them to give here. I found it hard to fully engage with any of the main characters and it is somehow ironic that the best performances seem to come from the supporting bit-players, especially those with only a line or two to deliver, simply, I suspect, because these characters have not been given the space in which to ""develop"" the ambiguities which plague the principals.
