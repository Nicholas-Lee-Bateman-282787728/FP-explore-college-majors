Maldonado Miracle is not only the latter, but is a true masterpiece of human drama. By the film's end, we see a far more pleasing miracle than the appearance of the blood on the Christ statue that sets the stage for most of the film. It is a miracle of how the boy is rewarded for his perserverance, and the wonderful element of what appears to be chance that makes it all happen.

This is Salma Hayek's directorial debut, and I look forward to seeing more of her work. Peter Fonda is Father Russell, who is at a turning point in his life, as are most of the other major players. The relationship between bar owner Cruz (Ruben Blades) and coffee shop owner Maisie (Mare Winningham) is especially charming. The essential plot revolves around a young boy (Eddy Martin) in search of his father, hiding in the church with his dog. I'm keeping this information cryptic so as not to provide any spoilers. Suffice it to say that this portrayal is well done, with fine actors and the occasional surprise humor.

797860,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0001AP0MW,Lee Armstrong,"[13, 14]","Salma Hayak's freshman directorial attempt is an entertaining film.  She comments in the DVD feature interview that it is difficult for women directors in Hollywood because it is a male-dominated profession.  However, this effort shows promise.  She also talks about how she searched to find Eddy Martin who plays Jose.  In his only screen role to date, Eddy does a fine job as the young boy who illegally crosses the border, befriended only by his dog, into a different American world.  Peter Fonda was first nominated for an Oscar as a screenwriter for ""Easy Rider"" in 1969.  It wasn't until his nomination for best actor in 1997 as the beekeeper in ""Ulee's Gold"" that his minimalist acting style was recognized for the intensity it generates on screen.  As Father Russell, he is a quiet brooding priest, about at a crisis of faith, who shepherds the small struggling church in San Ramos.  His performance is adept as in the scene where he faces reporters who want to know if there were a miracle.  Father Russell isn't sure and we see all the levels of conflict flash across Fonda's face as he considers what he believes, what he knows & what he should be saying.  Mare Winningham was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar for ""Georgia"" in 1995.  As the diner proprietor Maisie, she shows great tenderness to the little boy Jose, attraction for Cruz, and secret unhappiness.  Panamanian singer/actor Ruben Blades who was in ""The Cradle Will Rock"" and James Redford's (Robert's son) freshman directorial film ""Spin,"" does a nice job as the town local who has feelings for Maisie.  Soledad St. Hilaire was in ""Real Women Have Curves"" and does an outstanding job here as Josephina who discovers the miracle and embellishes it.  Father Russell has an assistant, Brother Amos, played by Scott Michael Thomas who was in ""Hart's War"" with Colin Farrell & Bruce Willis and also in ""Flight of the Phoenix.""  He does a nice job as the novice whose hopeful attitude is one that the town lacks.  My other favorite in this cast was Bill Sage who plays Lyle, married to the town beautician with a 10-year childless marriage.  Sage was in ""American Psycho"" and has a new sci-fi pic ""The Girl from Monday"" coming out this year.  He does an excellent job showing all the levels from blue collar beer-drinking sports enthusiast, negative down-in-the-mouth guy with an attitude, to loving prospective father as he and wife Stella have their own little miracle.  Although his will be an unheralded role, he delivers an excellent performance.  His wife Stella is played by Christina Cabot who had a small role in ""The Italian Job.""  Hayak says that the picture is about hope.  There is a lack of it in the town until the arrival of Jose.  Based on a Theodore Taylor novel, it is a sweet story that cheers the spirit and warms the heart.

It gently takes a swipe at human understanding (or lack of), chiding us also for wanting to be self-important whilst losing sight of what is really important in life, but then reminds us that if we stop looking for somebody to come in and make a grand gesture of change in our lives, we can see the small miracles that already have power in our lives. There are some truly fine performances here, especially in the on screen relationship between Mare Winningham and Ruben Blades. Peter Fonda's work here is every bit as crafted and lean as his earlier work in ""The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things."" Eddy Martin is a gem of a find as the young Mexican boy at the centre of events.

797862,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B0001AP0MW,"Promise ""promise""","[2, 2]","I found this film on the shelf of the public library.  I had never heard of it and didn't expect much from Salma Hayak as a director.  However the cast:  Ruben Blades, Peter Fonda and Mare Winningham assured me that this must have some value.  Still, as I put it in the DVD player I feared it would be another sappy inspirational film, maybe a take off on the wonderful Milagro Beanfield War (which also featured Blades).One of the good things about a DVD is you can always turn it off if you don't like it, so I took a chance.  At first I was still skeptical--another Mexican border town sentimental tale.  But I quickly got into it and, in very little time I was hooked.  The cast really helps.  Peter Fonda is an excellent priest!  His quiet gravity was charming, and yes, he is always sexy.  Mare Winningham has a relatively easy job, playing a stock character--the down-to-earth plain talking cafe owner with a heart of gold, but she does it perfectly, so no complaints there.  Ruben Blades, long a favorite of mine, is the rumpled looking bar owner, whose periodic small advances toward her have always met with her usual salty rejections.  The fact that they manage to progress past that point is one of the many miracles that occurs when the town is shaken up by the presence of blood on the crucifix in the church. There is a scene between them when Blades asks her if he can still come back and eat eggs at the diner, in which he is to-die-for adorable!The hero, is a small Mexican illegal who has crossed the border looking for his father.  He is played by a wonderful boy who, with Hayak's direction, avoids making the part overly cute or sentimental.The story unfolds naturally and all of the major and minor players do a great job in contributing to the color and activity of the film.In short the film is a simple reminder of the human need for hope, sometimes coming by signs and wonders.  I laughed and cried and was totally uplifted by watching it.  Cynics will hate it but that's their loss.  I highly recommend it to anyone who still possesses the ability to believe in miracles.",5,A Wonderful Surprise,1218844800,"08 16, 2008",2008,2099,"['found', 'film', 'shelf', 'public', 'library', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'Salma', 'Hayak', 'director', 'However', 'cast', 'Ruben', 'Blades', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'Mare', 'Winningham', 'assured', 'must', 'have', 'value', 'Still', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'feared', 'would', 'be', 'sappy', 'inspirational', 'film', 'maybe', 'take', 'off', 'wonderful', 'Milagro', 'Beanfield', 'War', 'also', 'featured', 'Blades', '.One', 'good', 'things', 'DVD', 'can', 'always', 'turn', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'took', 'chance', 'first', 'was', 'still', 'skeptical', 'Mexican', 'border', 'town', 'sentimental', 'tale', 'quickly', 'got', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'was', 'hooked', 'cast', 'really', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'excellent', 'priest', 'quiet', 'gravity', 'was', 'charming', 'yes', 'always', 'sexy', 'Mare', 'Winningham', 'relatively', 'easy', 'job', 'playing', 'stock', 'character', 'down-to-earth', 'plain', 'talking', 'cafe', 'owner', 'heart', 'gold', 'perfectly', 'complaints', 'there', 'Ruben', 'Blades', 'long', 'favorite', 'mine', 'rumpled', 'looking', 'bar', 'owner', 'periodic', 'small', 'advances', 'have', 'always', 'met', 'usual', 'salty', 'rejections', 'fact', 'manage', 'progress', 'point', 'one', 'many', 'miracles', 'when', 'town', 'shaken', 'up', 'presence', 'blood', 'crucifix', 'church', 'scene', 'when', 'Blades', 'can', 'still', 'come', 'back', 'eat', 'eggs', 'diner', 'to-die-for', 'adorable', 'hero', 'small', 'Mexican', 'illegal', 'who', 'crossed', 'border', 'looking', 'father', 'played', 'wonderful', 'boy', 'who', 'Hayak', 'direction', 'avoids', 'making', 'part', 'overly', 'cute', 'sentimental.The', 'story', 'unfolds', 'naturally', 'major', 'minor', 'players', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'contributing', 'color', 'activity', 'film.In', 'short', 'film', 'simple', 'reminder', 'human', 'need', 'hope', 'sometimes', 'coming', 'signs', 'wonders', 'laughed', 'cried', 'was', 'totally', 'uplifted', 'watching', 'Cynics', 'will', 'hate', 'loss', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'still', 'ability', 'believe', 'miracles']",The Maldonado Miracle
