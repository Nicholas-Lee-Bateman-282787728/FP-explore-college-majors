No specific reason, just because it's there. The boy, Stevie, is the leader of the two. He whips his dad's pistol out of his backpack and barges into the bank forcing everyone to the floor. Rocky, his girlfriend, remain's hesitant at first, but is soon enjoying a pleasure that she had never experienced: being on television. It may seem horrible that a film about youngster's holding up a bank even exist's, but Ash has directed a lyrical justice needing to be seen.You must understand why the movie was made at all; to shock and baffle. In a time where children are shooting down school hall's and killing their parent's, Ash's film gave me a new insight to the kid's point of view. What flow's through the strained mind of a child that doesn't care if he blows away a security guard? Rocky is very disturbed, and at the same time very innocent.Burt Reynold's shows up on the scene amidst a swarm of cops as the nagotiator. He blast's hateful word's out at Rocky and Stevie so fast that his tongue and lips can barely support the cigarette hanging from his mouth. His problem's range from the bank - to home. (His wife call's him every 15 second's and he blast's her too.)Some have said that Pup's was too long. How silly is that!Another problem that someone complained about, was the fact that the hostages could have ""taken out"" the kids by snapping their neck. The person that said that didn't understand the relationship quickly developed between the kids and those held captive by them.",4,Pick of the litter,1003708800,"10 22, 2001",2001,1618,"['Many', 'critic', 'took', 'extra', 'amount', 'time', 'view', 'Pup', 'most', 'liked', 'it.Two', 'kids', 'decide', 'hold', 'up', 'bank', 'specific', 'reason', 'just', 'there', 'boy', 'Stevie', 'leader', 'two', 'dad', 'pistol', 'backpack', 'bank', 'forcing', 'everyone', 'floor', 'Rocky', 'girlfriend', 'remain', 'hesitant', 'first', 'soon', 'enjoying', 'pleasure', 'had', 'never', 'experienced', 'being', 'television', 'may', 'seem', 'horrible', 'film', 'youngster', 'holding', 'up', 'bank', 'even', 'exist', 'Ash', 'directed', 'lyrical', 'justice', 'needing', 'be', 'seen.You', 'must', 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'shock', 'baffle', 'time', 'where', 'children', 'are', 'shooting', 'down', 'school', 'hall', 'killing', 'parent', 'Ash', 'film', 'gave', 'new', 'insight', 'kid', 'point', 'view', 'What', 'flow', 'strained', 'mind', 'child', ""n't"", 'care', 'away', 'security', 'guard', 'Rocky', 'very', 'disturbed', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'innocent.Burt', 'Reynold', 'up', 'scene', 'swarm', 'cops', 'nagotiator', 'blast', 'hateful', 'word', 'out', 'Rocky', 'Stevie', 'so', 'fast', 'tongue', 'lips', 'can', 'barely', 'support', 'cigarette', 'hanging', 'mouth', 'problem', 'range', 'bank', 'home', 'wife', 'call', '15', 'second', 'blast', 'too', 'have', 'said', 'Pup', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'How', 'silly', 'problem', 'someone', 'complained', 'was', 'fact', 'hostages', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'out', 'kids', 'snapping', 'neck', 'person', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'relationship', 'quickly', 'developed', 'kids', 'held', 'captive']",Pups
482421,A1UUC3WAXDJJWR,6305895562,Gordon Kearns,"[9, 11]","In the past twelve years are so, there has appeared a spate of good movies  that proved to be a minor revolution of sorts. In effect, they dragged that  frustratingly enigmatic 10 to 15 year-old age group out of the Pollyanna  era of easy stereotyping and presented the youngsters dwelling there as  real, sentient human beings. Not only did they present youthful characters  who were quite human in their thoughts, drives, ambitions, decisions, and  dialog, but they were cast with youthful actors of real substance, who  could stand up with the best of adults in the profession. &quot;Emma's  Shadow&quot;, &quot;Leon&quot;, &quot;Bastard Out of Carolina&quot;,  &quot;Ellen Foster&quot;, &quot;The Mighty&quot;, &quot;The Cure&quot;,  &quot;Lawn Dogs&quot;, &quot;Digging to China&quot;, and  &quot;Tumbleweeds&quot; are a few such daring offerings. Unfortunately,  most of these pictures, being independents, made-for-tv productions, or  controversial in content, received little public recognition or theatrical  exposure.&quot;Pups&quot; follows the pattern in three ways. The two  middle-school aged kids in this movie certainly have to be taken seriously.  Sure they acted impulsively and irresponsibly; kids who would decide on the  spur of the moment to rob a bank are not acting responsibly. Adults have  been known to choose as bad or worse actions, and for even less reason.  Obviously, there were situations in Stevie's life that seemed to lead him  in that dangerous direction. And obviously, even before he found his  mother's gun, you were given to know that on this particular day Stevie was  a disaster looking for a place to happen. And even though Rocky joined him  in his dangerous acts because of her attachment to him, you were given to  know she did so reluctantly (girls have been known to do that kind of thing  in the adult world too). That she would get caught up in the thrill of the  adventure and power of it all is quite human as well, which made the  situation the scarier since it seemed she might represent the only hope for  a rational resolution. FBI agent Daniel Bender (Burt Reynolds) grew to be  quite concerned for Stevie and Rocky as kids, and he struggled desperately  to keep them from getting hurt; but he didn't seem to know how to relate to  them as thinking and feeling humans.&quot;Pups&quot; also follows the  trend of those other revolutionary movies by getting very little public  exposure. Real-life tragedy interceded too dramatically.Finally,  &quot;Pups&quot; follows the pattern by casting in the roles of Stevie and  Rocky two young actors of consummate skill. Cameron Van Hoy is remarkable  in his first major role, and Mischa Barton adds another great performance  to her already impressive acting history (check out her stunning reading of  the role of the complex Devon in &quot;Lawn Dogs&quot;).This is as  powerful a movie as you'll ever see, possibly too powerful for some. But if  for no other reason, I recommend you see &quot;Pups&quot; for the  excitement of watching a pair of outstanding young actors in action.",5,So thirteen year-olds are real,965001600,"07 31, 2000",2000,3083,"['past', 'twelve', 'years', 'are', 'so', 'appeared', 'spate', 'good', 'movies', 'proved', 'be', 'minor', 'revolution', 'sorts', 'effect', 'dragged', 'frustratingly', 'enigmatic', '10', '15', 'year-old', 'age', 'group', 'Pollyanna', 'era', 'easy', 'stereotyping', 'presented', 'youngsters', 'dwelling', 'there', 'real', 'sentient', 'human', 'beings', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'present', 'youthful', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'quite', 'human', 'thoughts', 'drives', 'ambitions', 'decisions', 'dialog', 'were', 'cast', 'youthful', 'actors', 'real', 'substance', 'who', 'could', 'stand', 'up', 'best', 'adults', 'profession', 'quot', 'Emma', 'Shadow', 'quot', 'quot', 'Leon', 'quot', 'quot', 'Bastard', 'Out', 'Carolina', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ellen', 'Foster', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mighty', 'quot', 'quot', 'Cure', 'quot', 'quot', 'Lawn', 'Dogs', 'quot', 'quot', 'Digging', 'China', 'quot', 'quot', 'Tumbleweeds', 'quot', 'are', 'few', 'such', 'daring', 'offerings', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'pictures', 'being', 'independents', 'made-for-tv', 'productions', 'controversial', 'content', 'received', 'little', 'public', 'recognition', 'theatrical', 'exposure.', 'quot', 'Pups', 'quot', 'pattern', 'three', 'ways', 'two', 'middle-school', 'aged', 'kids', 'movie', 'certainly', 'have', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'Sure', 'acted', 'impulsively', 'irresponsibly', 'kids', 'who', 'would', 'decide', 'spur', 'moment', 'rob', 'bank', 'are', 'not', 'acting', 'responsibly', 'Adults', 'have', 'been', 'known', 'choose', 'bad', 'worse', 'actions', 'even', 'less', 'reason', 'Obviously', 'were', 'situations', 'Stevie', 'life', 'seemed', 'lead', 'dangerous', 'direction', 'obviously', 'even', 'found', 'mother', 'gun', 'were', 'given', 'know', 'particular', 'day', 'Stevie', 'was', 'disaster', 'looking', 'place', 'happen', 'even', 'Rocky', 'joined', 'dangerous', 'acts', 'attachment', 'were', 'given', 'know', 'did', 'so', 'reluctantly', 'girls', 'have', 'been', 'known', 'do', 'kind', 'thing', 'adult', 'world', 'too', 'would', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'thrill', 'adventure', 'power', 'quite', 'human', 'well', 'made', 'situation', 'scarier', 'seemed', 'might', 'represent', 'only', 'hope', 'rational', 'resolution', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Daniel', 'Bender', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'grew', 'be', 'quite', 'concerned', 'Stevie', 'Rocky', 'kids', 'struggled', 'desperately', 'keep', 'getting', 'hurt', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'how', 'relate', 'thinking', 'feeling', 'humans.', 'quot', 'Pups', 'quot', 'also', 'trend', 'other', 'revolutionary', 'movies', 'getting', 'very', 'little', 'public', 'exposure', 'Real-life', 'tragedy', 'interceded', 'too', 'dramatically.Finally', 'quot', 'Pups', 'quot', 'pattern', 'casting', 'roles', 'Stevie', 'Rocky', 'two', 'young', 'actors', 'consummate', 'skill', 'Cameron', 'Van', 'Hoy', 'remarkable', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'great', 'performance', 'already', 'impressive', 'acting', 'history', 'check', 'out', 'stunning', 'reading', 'role', 'complex', 'Devon', 'quot', 'Lawn', 'Dogs', 'quot', '.This', 'as', 'powerful', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'possibly', 'too', 'powerful', 'other', 'reason', 'recommend', 'see', 'quot', 'Pups', 'quot', 'excitement', 'watching', 'pair', 'outstanding', 'young', 'actors', 'action']",Pups

482424,A2RBRFLSI2MF5N,6305895562,"shane ferry ""shane""","[2, 2]","Pups is an entertaining and what i found thrilling movie. Newcomer Cameron Van Hoy does an excellent job as the very troubled Stevie, who has been left at home by his mother who is at a seminar (?) somewhere. When he stumbles upon his mothers loaded gun he brings his girlfriend Rocky (Mischa Barton) on a crazy ride. On impulse Stevie walks into a bank and starts waving the gun around. Soon we have a hostage situation and there are cops buzzing around everywhere. Burt Reynolds does a fine job as the reasoning FBI agent. This movie is not a classic but it does have some very good moments/scenes and overall it definatly isnt bad. The constant screaming of Stevie gets a little tedious but all adds to the effect of the panic one would be feeling in such a situation. I think Mischa Barton is great in this movie, Im a huge fan of hers. The ending is sad and my mouth dropped open in shock, call me an idiot but i wasnt expecting that!
