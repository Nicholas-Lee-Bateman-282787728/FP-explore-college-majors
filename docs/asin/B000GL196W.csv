1005251,A1PXEA1GUXC2R3,B000GL196W,Bundita,"[9, 9]","An EXCELLENT intermediate practice. The first segment of this video is an intense 50 minute flow sequence. The pacing of the sun salutations is moderate-to-fast, energizing, but not difficult to follow, and not before a nice long dangling Uttanasana (forward fold) to begin to warm you up. Following the fairly traditional warmup come some challenging asanas, (Parsva Bakasana (sideways crow), and a long Trikonasana series that includes Parivrtta Trikonasana (revolved triangle) for example) but instructor Donna Helm-Yost offers them as an option for those who can manage them, leaving plenty of modification options for those of us in the stages of approaching the full pose. Donna's instruction is excellent, helping the student to focus appropriately, never forgetting to work the dynamics of breathing into the postures, keeping the meditative mind throughout. The yin section is also excellently taught. It goes on just a little bit longer than I would find optimal, leaving me sleepy insted of energized, but others may not find this so. Donna has a good voice for teaching; soothing and down-to-earth. Her instruction rocks. The musical selection is inspiring without being at all intrusive. The studio setting is lovely, with lots of people of all shapes, sizes and levels of ability to suggest variations of the postures that might work for you. This has become one of my favorite yoga DVDs, and I reach for it almost any time I have 2 hours to devote to my practice.",5,One of my favorites when I have 2 hours to practice....,1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,1478,"['EXCELLENT', 'intermediate', 'practice', 'first', 'segment', 'video', 'intense', '50', 'minute', 'flow', 'sequence', 'pacing', 'sun', 'salutations', 'moderate-to-fast', 'energizing', 'not', 'difficult', 'follow', 'not', 'nice', 'long', 'dangling', 'Uttanasana', 'forward', 'fold', 'begin', 'warm', 'up', 'Following', 'fairly', 'traditional', 'warmup', 'come', 'challenging', 'asanas', 'Parsva', 'Bakasana', 'sideways', 'crow', 'long', 'Trikonasana', 'series', 'Parivrtta', 'Trikonasana', 'revolved', 'triangle', 'example', 'instructor', 'Donna', 'Helm-Yost', 'option', 'who', 'can', 'manage', 'leaving', 'plenty', 'modification', 'options', 'stages', 'approaching', 'full', 'pose', 'Donna', 'instruction', 'excellent', 'helping', 'student', 'focus', 'appropriately', 'never', 'forgetting', 'work', 'dynamics', 'breathing', 'postures', 'keeping', 'meditative', 'mind', 'yin', 'section', 'also', 'excellently', 'taught', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'longer', 'would', 'find', 'optimal', 'leaving', 'sleepy', 'insted', 'energized', 'others', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'so', 'Donna', 'good', 'voice', 'teaching', 'soothing', 'down-to-earth', 'instruction', 'rocks', 'musical', 'selection', 'inspiring', 'being', 'intrusive', 'studio', 'setting', 'lovely', 'lots', 'people', 'shapes', 'sizes', 'levels', 'ability', 'suggest', 'variations', 'postures', 'might', 'work', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'reach', 'almost', 'time', 'have', '2', 'hours', 'devote', 'practice']",Flow and Yin: A Balanced Yoga Practice with Donna Helm-Yost

I felt very motivated and relaxed in her hands.  The production quality is terrific and very natural: You feel like you're in the room!For those who like (need) a challenge, like myself, here it is.  For those who want to sit longer with poses, here it is.  It's TWO practices in one!  You can choose one or do both, which provides an optimal and full workout.I've spent nearly a year researching and building a yoga library.  In the process I've bought some bummers and clunkers.  This one I'm very happy to have bought.  And the fact Donna donates a portion of every sale towards animals is another reason to feel good.

However, I would not recommend this to anyone who doesn't know sanskrit. If you are a beginner or just not familar with the traditional yoga posture language then you might get a little confused. I recommend also checking out Tamara's Yoga Fusion. She has a great voice, she does speak sanskrit, however, she also gives you the english name for the postures as well. Plus, you can pick and choose from chapters of postures that you want to work on if you don't feel like doing the entire dvd.

She's a compassionate teacher, with a very approachable style. The practice is fairly demanding, so if you're a beginner, this is not for you.Typically, I do the flow or vinyasa portion of the DVD and then my own seated postures.  Her Yin section is very good, but I simply don't make time for yin on the days I do flow.  Her Yin practice has some shoulder opening poses that are hard to find anywhere else. (If you want a stand alone yin practice that's great try Erin Fleming's CD.)I've been doing this DVD for about a year and have yet to get bored with her or the sequence.  The vinyasa portion is about 45 minutes long and incorporates almost any pose you might want to do.The way Donna approaches her yoga is what sets this DVD apart from the rest of the pack: she's kind, understanding, and cheerful.",5,One of the best yoga videos out there.

The instruction is patient and sage-like, and I benefit both physically and emotionally each time I complete either the flow or the yin series, and having the time to do both back-to-back makes for an amazing yoga class. Helm-Yost's words of wisdom resonate with me often, filtering into my days to help make me aware of when I'm disconnected from a state of peace. For instance, she encourages the practicioner to focus on the present moment by gently being aware of whether we are ""anticipating, remembering, judging, worrying,"" and to redirect those thoughts to the breath. Her word choices are brilliant, and she is a truly inspiring instructor. I hope she will create additional practices on DVD. I'll be the first in line to pick up my copies.
