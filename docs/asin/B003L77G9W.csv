1351468,A1W9JOFE6F89FB,B003L77G9W,Amber MacDonald,"[0, 1]","The Family Guy, an animated series by Seth MacFarlane (A multi-talented, comedic mastermind), really needs no introduction. It  is well known for its audience drawing power, loyal and supportive fan base, and laugh out loud jokes, and sketch-style flash-backs. Part of what makes family guy so entertaining as a whole, is the theme that the show follows, which, though strikingly familiar feeling, comes off as completely original and fresh. If you are like me, then it is all but impossible to watch a show without paying close attention to what is being said. Generic ""filler lines"" used as cheap dialogue stand out to me. With family guy this is never the case. With each new episode, I wonder, how do they not run out of material? They haven't and I hope they don't.This 3 disc collection is a very high quality and exciting item to be sent to review. No expense was spared in its creation, and it is packed full of artwork, special features including those that let you glimpse the inner-workings of MacFarlane's comedy genius, and of course 14 episodes, featuring extended content, and scenes too funny for the FCC.I get lost in the show sometimes. The mere look on the colorful character's different faces as they silently stare at each other, or sometimes nothing, is enough to crack me up by itself. This show has  taken over animated comedy as we used to know it, and defined animated comedy as we currently know it, all the while raising the bar to seemingly unmatchable standards and refusing to release its grip on us.The content of this disc is worth the purchase. I guarantee any fan of the series would be completelyecstatic to receive this as a gift. If you are a fan of the series, even if your not, you should pick this one up, after all, laughter really is the best medicine. And I haven't laughed this hard in a long time.",5,A Great Gift For Any Man at Any Time,1327017600,"01 20, 2012",2012,1843,"['Family', 'Guy', 'animated', 'series', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'multi-talented', 'comedic', 'mastermind', 'really', 'introduction', 'well', 'known', 'audience', 'drawing', 'power', 'loyal', 'supportive', 'fan', 'base', 'out', 'loud', 'jokes', 'sketch-style', 'flash-backs', 'Part', 'what', 'family', 'guy', 'so', 'entertaining', 'whole', 'theme', 'show', 'strikingly', 'familiar', 'feeling', 'off', 'completely', 'original', 'fresh', 'are', 'then', 'impossible', 'watch', 'show', 'paying', 'close', 'attention', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'Generic', 'filler', 'lines', 'used', 'cheap', 'dialogue', 'stand', 'out', 'family', 'guy', 'never', 'case', 'new', 'episode', 'wonder', 'how', 'do', 'not', 'run', 'material', 'have', ""n't"", 'hope', ""don't.This"", '3', 'disc', 'collection', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'exciting', 'item', 'be', 'sent', 'review', 'expense', 'was', 'spared', 'creation', 'packed', 'full', 'artwork', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'let', 'glimpse', 'inner-workings', 'MacFarlane', 'comedy', 'genius', 'course', '14', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'extended', 'content', 'scenes', 'too', 'funny', 'FCC.I', 'get', 'lost', 'show', 'sometimes', 'mere', 'look', 'colorful', 'character', 'different', 'silently', 'stare', 'other', 'sometimes', 'nothing', 'enough', 'crack', 'up', 'show', 'taken', 'over', 'animated', 'comedy', 'used', 'know', 'defined', 'animated', 'comedy', 'currently', 'know', 'while', 'raising', 'bar', 'seemingly', 'unmatchable', 'standards', 'refusing', 'release', 'grip', 'us.The', 'content', 'disc', 'purchase', 'guarantee', 'fan', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'completelyecstatic', 'receive', 'gift', 'are', 'fan', 'series', 'even', 'not', 'should', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'laughter', 'really', 'best', 'medicine', 'have', ""n't"", 'laughed', 'hard', 'long', 'time']",N/A

But FAMILY GUY still goes strong...or still goes...or however you want to look at it.VOLUME 9 (no telling what half-seasons it comprises) is the weakest collection to date; there's no doubt about it.  The show has become too self-aware, too eager to push the limits and mock FOX, the network that won't dare cancel it (for the third time).  MacFarlane and company are still funny, but they have a tendency to take the joke too far, to go that extra step that kills the humor (the ""that's why it's funny, stupid"" moment).  Almost every joke seems designed to push the limits merely for the sake of ""going there.""And yet we keep watching.  Why?  Because of the creative curiosity behind such episodes as ""And Then There Were Fewer.""  Because this animated show actually adapted a Richard Matheson short story (""The Splendid Source"").  Because Adam West is still prominently featured.  And there's something to be said about the audacity of a musical number called ""Down Syndrome Girl.""The show is far too self-referential (the entire cast/crew seems all too aware that its best seasons are behind them, and are pretty much riding their own coattails), but FAMILY GUY still brings the yucks.

1351484,AXYIAI192RDKM,B003L77G9W,"Jeffrey R. Kuntzelman 2014 ""~JRK 2014""","[22, 35]","So I started watching this show back in 2004 when it was on Adult Swim and had been canceled by FOX not once but twice.  Over the past few years, especially since the straight-to-DVD ""Family Guy Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story"", I've come to really enjoy the puns, the twists, the cut-aways, the off-color remarks, jokes, and even the low-brow humor that laughs at our deep-seeded divisions in the world today.  All of my favorite episodes to date have been mostly the ""Road to.."" episodes with the exception being ""Lethal Weapons"".  My recent favorite has been ""Not all Dogs go to heaven"" with the cast of Star Trek, and being a Trek fan myself this was absolutely delightful (and the uncensored version is even better) and very un-Trek like.However, this past year or so, the humor on Family Guy has hit a turn for the worst.  The ""Brian And Stewie"" episode was just WEIRD, and the more recent episode of Stewie having an evil clone, that was just terrible.  I mean, I guess we (the fans) always wanted Stewie to finally conquer the world and kill Lois in all of his earlier rants in earlier seasons, but this was just.... bad.  ""Brian Griffin's House of Payne"" was another awful episode where they go as far as to show Stewie getting injured and nobody cared.  I mean, that's just... that's wrong on so many levels I don't even know where to start.""Quagmire's Dad"" was another awful episode where we see Quagmire losing his humor (as another reviewer pointed out) even further, and even further divides the crew further, and by crew I mean it was originally Peter, Joe, Cleveland, and Quagmire with the occasional appearance by Brian, and now it's mostly just Peter and Joe.  I would dare say that this is one of those episodes that pushes the envelope just a little too far in terms of violent action, raunchy dialogue, and foul language all rolled into one.Peter's character (played by the series creator) has changed over the past three seasons.  He's gone from that drunken idiot that we all know and love to someone who's mind is that of a mentally challenged 4th grader who, despite being big physically, he still thinks he's a kid and can get away with doing anything he wants.  Stewie has also changed drastically, and although the sexual ambiguity is funny at times, it is a little awkward.  Brian has gone through some changes too.  We no longer see him as the boozing, smoking, eloquent moderate-minded dog.  He's gone way too liberal, even for my tastes.  There is such a thing as too much.  Meg is just... well, Meg.  I mean we can't really argue the fact that her interaction is minimal unless an episode calls for it.  Chris is still someone who's smart, but hides in the idea that he's an idiot much like his dad.  There's really nothing funny about that except that maybe he'll crack an intelligent joke once in a while, and most of the time doesn't even realize it.Don't get me wrong, though.  There are still some damned funny episodes to be watched on this series, and although I think it's popularity has somewhat declined over the past two years due to some deep political division in the United States, it still has its moments of laughter, of good ol' fashioned toilet humor, and pokin' fun at pretty much anything and everything.Like another reviewer, I'll probably buy this just to complete my collection, but don't expect me to watch it over and over again.  Truth be told, I can see this show coming to an end pretty soon, maybe within a season or two if its lucky.  It just has lost that edgy humor that I once loved in the show to begin with.  It's gone from flavorful to sour in a matter of two years, and unless the series creator hires a fresh new writing staff, we're gonna see this show end abruptly when the wrong toes are stepped on.Overall, I give this volume three stars only because there's still some glimmer of hope left for the show, but don't expect a lot.

1351493,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B003L77G9W,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[1, 1]","Volumes 7 and 8 of the Family Guy DVD series were disappointments for me.  The quality of the episodes declined so significantly I almost gave up on the show.  The series righted itself, however, with Volume 9; in fact, it is my favorite Family Guy Volume except for maybe Volume 6 with its brilliant ""Stewie Kills Lois""/""Lois Kills Stewie"" two-parter.  Almost every episode is excellent save for ""April in Quahog"" which I think is rather weak.  It also has many laugh-out-loud moments.  The scenes where Stewie gets punched (once by Brian and another time by Peter) are hilarious.  When I first saw the title ""Class Holes,"" I think I laughed for a full minute.  The double-length season nine debut ""And Then There Were Fewer"" is one of the best FG episodes ever.  I also like the episode where Meg finally gets her revenge on those who've demeaned her (which is, pretty much, every character on the show).Disc 1:""Business Guy""--Peter throws father-in-law Mr. Pewterschmidt a belated bachelor party which causes him to have a heart attack and slip into a coma.  Peter takes over the Pewterschmidt company with predictable results.  When Mr. Pewterschmidt recovers, Peter will not relinquish his position.  The swamp monster/Scooby-Doo ending was lame, but it is still a good episode.  Peter to the intercom: ""Peggy, that fart I had at three, can you push that up to now?""""Big Man On Hippocampus""--The Griffins are on Family Feud and Peter is knocked out by Richard Dawson (it was bound to happen) and develops amnesia.  He has to be re-taught everything and, when Lois teaches him how to make love, he decides he can do it with anyone he wants.  When Lois leaves the unfaithful Peter, Quagmire tries to move in.""Dial Meg For Murder""--Brian is writing an article on the average teenage girl for Teen People and follows Meg around and discovers she is dating a convict.  When she hides her boyfriend from the cops after he escapes, she goes to jail herself and returns a bada$$: ""I'm home, you're all my b!#@#es now.""""Extra Large Medium""--Stewie and Chris get lost in the woods and a psychic gives Lois comfort they will be found (curiously, she never specified ""alive,"" but Lois takes the prediction in a positive way).  Lois then depends on the psychic and Brian tries to convince her the medium is a fake, but nothing convinces Lois more than when Peter decides he has psychic powers.  Meanwhile, Chris tries to date a girl with Downs Syndrome who bosses him around. She is terrible, but the ending is hilarious.""Go, Stewie, Go""--Stewie wants to be in his favorite kid's television show ""Jolly Farm,"" but to get a part he needs to pretend he is a girl.  He then falls in love with his female co-star.  Meanwhile, Lois is getting tired of Peter putting her down and desires Meg's compliment-throwing boyfriend.Disc 2:""Peter-Assment""--Peter's boss, Angela, hasn't had ""it"" in years and , when Peter comes to work without glasses, she becomes attracted to him and threatens to fire him if he doesn't satisfy her desires.  Peter actually shows a compassionate side in this episode.  As for the school play at the beginning: Terri Schiavo was an odd news story to revive (so to speak).""Brian Griffin's House of Payne""--Stewie digs out an old script written by ""H. Brian Griffin.""  Lois uses her father's television connections to get Brian a TV pilot, but the television execs make changes to Brian's story, for example, hiring James Woods to play the lead, changing the plot to a father and 18 year-old daughter in college together, and changing the title from ""What I Learned on Jefferson Street"" to ""Class Holes.""  I laughed out loud so many times to this episode.""April in Quahog""--The Griffins, along with the rest of Quahog, await the end of the world only to learn it was an April Fool's joke by the news team.  When they thought it was the end, Peter let it be known he hates being around the kids.  When they survive, he has some explaining to do.  This is the weakest episode of this volume and the ending was rushed.""Brian and Stewie""--As lame as the preceding episode was, this one is actually very heavy although there are many hilarious moments, too.  Brian and Stewie get locked in a bank vault for the weekend and battle, laugh, compromise, and share very serious feelings.  This may be the only episode that only has two characters in it.""Quagmire's Dad""--Quagmire builds up his dad's reputation as being a lady killer and becomes horrified when he learns his war hero father is going to have a sex change operation.  If that were not enough humiliation for Quagmire, he finds out his ""he-she father"" slept with his mortal enemy: Brian.""The Splendid Source""--Quagmire tells Peter and Joe a dirty joke and they go on a quest to find its source.  Their travels take them to Virginia to be reunited with Cleveland and then to Washington D.C. where they make an astounding discovery:  the Obama Memorial (ha, ha, just kidding).  The dirty joke is told at the end; it is nasty.Disc 3:""And Then There Were Fewer""--This is one of my favorite FG episodes.  It brings in all the prominent characters, including the hilarious airhead Jillian.  Quahog citizens are invited to a dinner party hosted by James Woods.  He wants to apologize to everyone, but then there is a murder, and then another one, and then another one.  Who is responsible?  This double-length who-done-it, it very well-done and clever and, graphically, it looks like a movie.""Excellence in Broadcasting""--Rush Limbaugh comes to Quahog for a book-signing and an angry Brian goes to confront him.  Leaving the book signing, Brian is inexplicably attacked by a gang and is saved by Limbaugh.  In return, Brian agrees to read his book and turns into a hardcore conservative.  Brian seems at his least articulate at the beginning of this episode.  Maybe his anger was clouding his thoughts.  The show was very kind to Limbaugh and even had him morph into an eagle at the end.""Welcome Back Carter""--Peter catches Mr. Pewterschmidt cheating on his wife.  Good episode, but, what I don't understand about this one and also the episode in another volume where Brian is dating a 50 year old is, how old do they think these people are?  The back story of Carter and Babs Pewterschmidt would make them in their 80s at the youngest and more like 90s or 100s!  The song ""Jeepers Creepers"" came out in 1938.Extras include deleted scenes which were best kept deleted, commentary on select episodes, a comic-style phone conversation for ""Brian and Stewie,"" ""The Making Of 'And Then There Were Fewer',"" Comic-Con 2010, ""The History of the World According to FG,"" etc.",5,"""I'm home, you're all my b!#@#es now.""--Meg",1331424000,"03 11,
