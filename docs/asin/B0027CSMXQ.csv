1253944,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B0027CSMXQ,K.T. May,"[3, 4]","Sex appeal.  Comedy.  Drama.  Action.  You want it.  And you've got it with Burn Notice.Burn Notice is a television series on the USA Network.  The sexy Jeffrey Donovan plays the main character, Michael Westen, a former spy who has been ""burned"", or blacklisted, by the agency he used to work for with no knowledge as to why, and is then dumped smack in the middle of Miami, Florida.Westen spends most of the series trying to find out who issued his burn notice while honing his intelligence skills on jobs that seem to find him, sometimes at the worst possible times.  You will be drawn in to his voiceover explanations of the weapons he's creating or the situations he is devising and will find yourself comparing him to a modern-day James Bond or MacGuyver.  He can convey that something isn't going as well as he had hoped with a subtle look on his face and when he slips on his glasses and grins, you know things are going to get interesting.  He has a quick, sly wit and a penchant for sharp suits.  He has a sordid past with an abusive, alcoholic father, yet he always makes time for his over-worred mom, (Sharon Gless), no matter how bad her timing is.  He can be caught up in a deadly job but still make it to her family counseling sessions.He also has a strong liking for yogurt.Cult favorite Bruce Campbell, (Evil Dead, Army of Darkness), stars as Sam, Westen's aging partner in crime who is an ex-Navy Seal with skills just as sharp as Michael's.  Sam enjoys drinking anything with alcohol in it at the local hangouts and checking out the pretty ladies on the beach, even trying to scoop up some for some possible food and shelter.  Sam usually ends up bringing jobs to Michael that seem harmless and end up turning into quite the conundrum.  But Sam comes in handy for creating distractions, like posing as a man who needs to ship Pilates balls in large quantities to some gun-runners just so he can check out their warehouse and report back to Michael.And just when you thought you couldn't have a strong, respectable female character who still exudes a razor-sharp sex appeal and a talent for weaponry, enter Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar, who you might have seen in the film The Three Musketeers), Westen's ex-girlfriend and an ex-IRA member.  She can take care of herself, sometimes a little too well, even when posing as the damsel in distress.  She can make household bombs and render a man helpless with her looks, as well as her weaponry and fast fighting style.  She'll do anything for Michael, and vice versa.  Being a spy had forced Michael to end their relationship, but Fi still holds out hope that maybe they can someday be together, despite what Michael says.In a series complete with twists, but no too many as to become cliched, informative and comical voiceovers, excellent comedic timing, (including the introduction of characters from time to time), and more guns than you can shake a stick at, it's hard not to be entertained by this refreshing show.  You're kept on the edge of your seat, knowing that when the day finally comes that we learn who burned Michael, it won't be anti-climactic.  It's hard to say ""that was a good episode"" when every episode is incredible.Well-written, great acting, a respectful female lead and comedy and guns for all!  If you don't watch this show now, you should.  And if you do watch this show, you already know what everyone else is missing.Bet you can't watch just one!",5,His name is Michael Westen...,1254096000,"09 28, 2009",2009,3433,"['Sex', 'appeal', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Action', 'want', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Burn', 'Notice.Burn', 'Notice', 'television', 'series', 'USA', 'Network', 'sexy', 'Jeffrey', 'Donovan', 'main', 'character', 'Michael', 'Westen', 'former', 'spy', 'who', 'been', 'burned', 'blacklisted', 'agency', 'used', 'work', 'knowledge', 'why', 'then', 'dumped', 'smack', 'middle', 'Miami', 'Florida.Westen', 'most', 'series', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'issued', 'burn', 'notice', 'honing', 'intelligence', 'skills', 'jobs', 'seem', 'find', 'sometimes', 'worst', 'possible', 'times', 'will', 'be', 'drawn', 'voiceover', 'explanations', 'weapons', 'creating', 'situations', 'devising', 'will', 'find', 'comparing', 'modern-day', 'James', 'Bond', 'MacGuyver', 'can', 'convey', 'something', ""n't"", 'going', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'hoped', 'subtle', 'look', 'face', 'when', 'glasses', 'grins', 'know', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'interesting', 'quick', 'sly', 'wit', 'penchant', 'sharp', 'suits', 'sordid', 'past', 'abusive', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'yet', 'always', 'time', 'over-worred', 'mom', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'timing', 'can', 'be', 'caught', 'up', 'deadly', 'job', 'still', 'make', 'family', 'counseling', 'sessions.He', 'also', 'strong', 'liking', 'yogurt.Cult', 'favorite', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Army', 'Darkness', 'Sam', 'Westen', 'aging', 'partner', 'crime', 'who', 'ex-Navy', 'Seal', 'skills', 'just', 'as', 'sharp', 'Michael', 'Sam', 'drinking', 'anything', 'alcohol', 'local', 'hangouts', 'checking', 'out', 'pretty', 'ladies', 'beach', 'even', 'trying', 'scoop', 'up', 'possible', 'food', 'shelter', 'Sam', 'usually', 'up', 'bringing', 'jobs', 'Michael', 'seem', 'harmless', 'end', 'up', 'turning', 'conundrum', 'Sam', 'handy', 'creating', 'distractions', 'posing', 'man', 'who', 'ship', 'Pilates', 'balls', 'large', 'quantities', 'gun-runners', 'just', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'warehouse', 'report', 'back', 'Michael.And', 'just', 'when', 'thought', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'strong', 'respectable', 'female', 'character', 'who', 'still', 'razor-sharp', 'sex', 'appeal', 'talent', 'weaponry', 'enter', 'Fiona', 'Gabrielle', 'Anwar', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'Westen', 'ex-girlfriend', 'ex-IRA', 'member', 'can', 'take', 'care', 'herself', 'sometimes', 'little', 'too', 'well', 'even', 'when', 'posing', 'damsel', 'distress', 'can', 'make', 'household', 'bombs', 'render', 'man', 'helpless', 'looks', 'as', 'well', 'weaponry', 'fast', 'fighting', 'style', ""'ll"", 'do', 'anything', 'Michael', 'vice', 'versa', 'Being', 'spy', 'had', 'forced', 'Michael', 'end', 'relationship', 'Fi', 'still', 'out', 'hope', 'maybe', 'can', 'someday', 'be', 'together', 'what', 'Michael', 'says.In', 'series', 'complete', 'twists', 'too', 'many', 'become', 'cliched', 'informative', 'comical', 'voiceovers', 'excellent', 'comedic', 'timing', 'including', 'introduction', 'characters', 'time', 'time', 'more', 'guns', 'can', 'shake', 'stick', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'entertained', 'refreshing', 'show', ""'re"", 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'knowing', 'when', 'day', 'finally', 'learn', 'who', 'burned', 'Michael', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'anti-climactic', 'hard', 'say', 'was', 'good', 'episode', 'when', 'episode', 'incredible.Well-written', 'great', 'acting', 'respectful', 'female', 'lead', 'comedy', 'guns', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'show', 'now', 'should', 'do', 'watch', 'show', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'missing.Bet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'just', 'one']",Burn Notice: Seasons 1-2

The series three main characters all with ties to the espionage world function well and superbly to get their job done through each episode, as well as trying to find out who was the one that betrayed one of them and left them with a ""Burn Notice"".  The series has the great mix of action, suspense, drama, action, romance, and intrigue to keep any spy movie/t.v. fan glued to the television to find out what happens next.  The two actors and the actress who play the three main roles fit their roles perfectly Bruce Campbell one of my all time favorites,  Gabrielle Anwar another all time favorite, and playing the lead role Jeffrey Donovan while I haven't seen much of the shows he's done in his carer is still a great choice for his role.
