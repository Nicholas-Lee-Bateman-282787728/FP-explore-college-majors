193330,A15STWX7P0NE0D,160399355X,Christopher R. Hernandez,"[9, 10]","Shout! Factory continues with their release of this funny 80's sitcom with The Complete Second Season.  What makes this release different than their first season release, is that this is an online exclusive.  As with other less popular retail titles like Mr Belvedere Season Four and Room 222 Season Two, My Two Dads The Complete Second season is only available though Shout! Factory's website and private marketplace sellers on amazon and ebay.This set is a barebones set, but the episode are complete.  Some have the NBC logos and commercial bumpers included in the episodes themselves.  No music is replaced and there are a few songs heard this season which remain intact on the DVD.  The video is clear as well as the audio.  There were only 16 episodes produced for the second season, and they are spread out on three discs.  The menus are pretty similar to the first set and have an 80's-ish feel to them.  The show continues to bring us laughs in its second season.  Guest stars include Chad Allen, Peter Noone (Herman's Hermits), Davy Jones (The Monkees), Willie Mays and none other than Richard Moll as Bull who bodyguards Judge Wilbur in a crossover episode.  With only one more season to go, if enough fans buy this set hopefully Shout! Factory can release the final set sometime soon.",5,My Two Dads The Complete Second Season,1269820800,"03 29, 2010",2010,1296,"['Shout', 'Factory', 'release', 'funny', '80', 'sitcom', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', 'What', 'release', 'different', 'first', 'season', 'release', 'online', 'exclusive', 'other', 'less', 'popular', 'retail', 'titles', 'Mr', 'Belvedere', 'Season', 'Four', 'Room', '222', 'Season', 'Two', 'Two', 'Complete', 'Second', 'season', 'only', 'available', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'website', 'private', 'marketplace', 'sellers', 'amazon', 'ebay.This', 'set', 'barebones', 'set', 'episode', 'are', 'complete', 'have', 'NBC', 'logos', 'commercial', 'bumpers', 'included', 'episodes', 'music', 'replaced', 'are', 'few', 'songs', 'heard', 'season', 'remain', 'intact', 'DVD', 'video', 'clear', 'as', 'well', 'audio', 'were', 'only', '16', 'episodes', 'produced', 'second', 'season', 'are', 'spread', 'out', 'three', 'discs', 'menus', 'are', 'pretty', 'similar', 'first', 'set', 'have', ""80's-ish"", 'feel', 'show', 'bring', 'second', 'season', 'Guest', 'include', 'Chad', 'Allen', 'Peter', 'Noone', 'Herman', 'Hermits', 'Davy', 'Jones', 'Monkees', 'Willie', 'Mays', 'none', 'other', 'Richard', 'Moll', 'Bull', 'who', 'bodyguards', 'Judge', 'Wilbur', 'crossover', 'episode', 'only', 'one', 'more', 'season', 'go', 'enough', 'fans', 'buy', 'set', 'hopefully', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'can', 'release', 'final', 'set', 'sometime', 'soon']",N/A
193331,A1KVF4MKAGF67P,160399355X,Diane L. Mechlinski,"[1, 1]","I completely enjoyed watching the second season of ""My Two Dads"". I've also watched the first season, and find that this show is just something that is very enjoyable and entertaining to watch even though the story premise takes place a couple decades ago. The entire cast is well-suited with one another and the story lines are handled in a way that I wish more shows today still did. The problems of kids growing up, of parents (be they single or not) still remain the same no matter what decade they take place in. Joey and Michael are such a good balance of character, and although their morals are depicted as slightly different from each other, they always blend into the good and common interest of Nicole. The show's serious moments are often sprinkled with a great comedy that adds the kind of lightness that could help us all in reality. Every person in this serious adds their own special talent to the stories of each episode, and the acting is superb. A truly great show! My only negative comment would be that it takes so very long for each season to come out. And that is not good as it would be best to be able to watch each season in a more relatively timely fashion.",5,A Sweet and Very Funny Comedy Series,1283904000,"09 8, 2010",2010,1184,"['completely', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'second', 'season', 'Two', 'Dads', ""'ve"", 'also', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'find', 'show', 'just', 'something', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'even', 'story', 'premise', 'place', 'couple', 'decades', 'ago', 'entire', 'cast', 'well-suited', 'one', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'handled', 'way', 'wish', 'more', 'shows', 'today', 'still', 'did', 'problems', 'kids', 'growing', 'up', 'parents', 'be', 'single', 'not', 'still', 'remain', 'same', 'matter', 'what', 'decade', 'take', 'place', 'Joey', 'Michael', 'are', 'such', 'good', 'balance', 'character', 'morals', 'are', 'depicted', 'slightly', 'different', 'other', 'always', 'blend', 'good', 'common', 'interest', 'Nicole', 'show', 'serious', 'moments', 'are', 'often', 'sprinkled', 'great', 'comedy', 'kind', 'lightness', 'could', 'help', 'reality', 'person', 'serious', 'own', 'special', 'talent', 'stories', 'episode', 'acting', 'superb', 'truly', 'great', 'show', 'only', 'negative', 'comment', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'very', 'long', 'season', 'come', 'out', 'not', 'good', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'season', 'more', 'relatively', 'timely', 'fashion']",N/A

Meanwhile, her single dads are also enmeshed in their own dating woes, as well as embarking on a new career helping manage a financial magazine.Supporting cast includes Florence Stanley as the dry-witted Judge Margaret Wilbur, Dick Butkus as diner owner Ed Klawicki, and Amy Hathaway and Von Ribisi as Nicole's friends Shelby and Corey.Davy Jones of The Monkees guest stars as Joey's musician friend.",4,Great '80s sitcom!,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,849,"['death', 'mother', '12-year-old', 'Nicole', 'Bradford', 'Staci', 'Keanan', 'was', 'sent', 'live', 'two', 'men', 'conservative', 'Michael', 'Paul', 'Reiser', 'free-spirited', 'Joey', 'Greg', 'Evignan', 'whom', 'could', 'be', 'biological', 'father.As', 'much', 'Season', '1', 'focused', 'new', 'family', 'adjustment', 'one', 'Season', '2', 'finds', 'Nicole', 'now', '14', 'navigating', 'many', 'typical', 'teenage', 'coming-of-age', 'dilemmas', 'such', 'peer', 'pressure', 'boys', 'school', 'activities', 'Meanwhile', 'single', 'dads', 'are', 'also', 'enmeshed', 'own', 'dating', 'woes', 'as', 'well', 'embarking', 'new', 'career', 'helping', 'manage', 'financial', 'magazine.Supporting', 'cast', 'Florence', 'Stanley', 'dry-witted', 'Judge', 'Margaret', 'Wilbur', 'Dick', 'Butkus', 'diner', 'owner', 'Ed', 'Klawicki', 'Amy', 'Hathaway', 'Von', 'Ribisi', 'Nicole', 'friends', 'Shelby', 'Corey.Davy', 'Jones', 'Monkees', 'guest', 'stars', 'Joey', 'musician', 'friend']",N/A
