1663528,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00E0MT3SE,Andrew Ellington,"[9, 13]","I should start by saying that I am not a prude.  The world should know this by now.  I mean, I will watch nearly any and everything, and the squeamish doesn&#8217;t make me think any less of you.  I particularly enjoy a film that pushes me; that actually causes me to question things or makes me uncomfortable because of its stance or presentation.But honestly, &#8216;The Act of Killing&#8217; kind of rubbed me the wrong way.I know that this has been lauded and I know that this has received many (and I mean MANY) awards, but as a complete film I found myself wondering why it was being lauded and praised so deeply.  I understand the point the filmmakers were getting at, and yet while I feel that to a degree (and I guess that degree really depends on who it is that is watching the movie) the film made that point, the point is lost (at least for me) in the filmmakers directorial and visual decisions.  The subject is harrowing, the presentation is creative and the final frames are intoxicating and yet together these all create a film I found somewhat distasteful.&#8216;The Act of Killing&#8217;, Joshua Oppenheimer&#8217;s Oscar nominated Documentary, dares to allow Indonesian death squad leaders to tell their stories cinematically.  They were allowed to select the film genres they desired and essentially act out their disgusting atrocities for our viewing pleasure.  Yes, there is a point to this madness (for as they watch back on playback you can see the realities of their horrors sink in) but for me the payoff is too little to justify the means here.  I know that many will not agree with me, and I&#8217;ve already been told that I was wrong for thinking this, but to me &#8216;The Act of Killing&#8217; was too exploitive for its own good.  In a way, the first half of the film comes across almost glorifying the acts, while the second half serves as a means to poke fun at these morally corrupt individuals.  Watching these viscous men dress up like women in colorful costumes, parading around covered in fake blood or singing show tunes feels oddly theatrical and uncomfortably humorous when you consider the context of the film itself.  Giving these men free reign as they reminisce on when they were kings, killing on a whim and destroying lives, all the while their eyes filled with glee; my head was throbbing in anger and confusion.Why?I feel like &#8216;The Act of Killing&#8217; has a very powerful message to convey, but I don&#8217;t agree with Oppenheimer&#8217;s choices here.  Yes, seeing Anwar dry heave at the very thought of what he had done is a very raw and mesmerizing moment, and it at least confirms that this &#8216;exercise&#8217; was beneficial to an extent (even if the moment is short lived and Anwar then proceeds to joyfully show his grandchildren the &#8216;scene&#8217; where he dies), but I question whether this was an exercise the rest of us needed to see.",3,An uncomfortable act&#8230;,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,2913,"['should', 'start', 'saying', 'am', 'not', 'prude', 'world', 'should', 'know', 'now', 'mean', 'will', 'watch', 'nearly', 'everything', 'squeamish', 'doesn', '8217', 'make', 'think', 'less', 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'film', 'actually', 'question', 'things', 'uncomfortable', 'stance', 'presentation.But', 'honestly', '8216', 'Act', 'Killing', '8217', 'kind', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'way.I', 'know', 'been', 'lauded', 'know', 'received', 'many', 'mean', 'MANY', 'awards', 'complete', 'film', 'found', 'wondering', 'why', 'was', 'being', 'lauded', 'praised', 'so', 'deeply', 'understand', 'point', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'getting', 'yet', 'feel', 'degree', 'guess', 'degree', 'really', 'who', 'watching', 'movie', 'film', 'made', 'point', 'point', 'lost', 'least', 'filmmakers', 'directorial', 'visual', 'decisions', 'subject', 'harrowing', 'presentation', 'creative', 'final', 'frames', 'are', 'intoxicating', 'yet', 'together', 'create', 'film', 'found', 'somewhat', 'distasteful.', '8216', 'Act', 'Killing', '8217', 'Joshua', 'Oppenheimer', '8217', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Documentary', 'allow', 'Indonesian', 'death', 'squad', 'leaders', 'tell', 'stories', 'cinematically', 'were', 'allowed', 'select', 'film', 'genres', 'desired', 'essentially', 'act', 'out', 'disgusting', 'atrocities', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'Yes', 'point', 'madness', 'watch', 'back', 'playback', 'can', 'see', 'realities', 'horrors', 'sink', 'payoff', 'too', 'little', 'justify', 'means', 'here', 'know', 'many', 'will', 'not', 'agree', '8217', 'already', 'been', 'told', 'was', 'wrong', 'thinking', '8216', 'Act', 'Killing', '8217', 'was', 'too', 'exploitive', 'own', 'good', 'way', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'almost', 'glorifying', 'acts', 'second', 'half', 'serves', 'means', 'poke', 'fun', 'morally', 'corrupt', 'individuals', 'Watching', 'viscous', 'men', 'dress', 'up', 'like', 'women', 'colorful', 'costumes', 'parading', 'around', 'covered', 'fake', 'blood', 'singing', 'show', 'tunes', 'feels', 'oddly', 'theatrical', 'uncomfortably', 'humorous', 'when', 'consider', 'context', 'film', 'Giving', 'men', 'free', 'reign', 'reminisce', 'when', 'were', 'kings', 'killing', 'whim', 'destroying', 'lives', 'eyes', 'filled', 'glee', 'head', 'was', 'throbbing', 'anger', 'confusion.Why', 'feel', '8216', 'Act', 'Killing', '8217', 'very', 'powerful', 'message', 'convey', 'don', '8217', 'agree', 'Oppenheimer', '8217', 's', 'choices', 'here', 'Yes', 'seeing', 'Anwar', 'dry', 'heave', 'very', 'thought', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'very', 'raw', 'mesmerizing', 'moment', 'least', 'confirms', '8216', 'exercise', '8217', 'was', 'beneficial', 'extent', 'even', 'moment', 'short', 'lived', 'Anwar', 'then', 'joyfully', 'show', 'grandchildren', '8216', 'scene', '8217', 'where', 'question', 'was', 'exercise', 'rest', 'needed', 'see']",Act of Killing

Below is my opinion.The GoodIt reveals Indonesian government used gangsters to kill hundreds of thousands of communists in 1965 and 1966.  These gangsters publicly claimed they worked for the government.It shows how brutal the killings were. For example, in one scene, the killer shows how he uses a wire with 2 pieces of wood tied to both end to cut off the head of the prisoner.It exposes the people who were killed did not get a fair trial. It implies some innocent people were killed because they were alleged of being communists.The BadThe way the story was told is boring. The majority of the film shows the re-enacted killings done by two old gangsters who claimed to have killed a lot of people. The re-enactments look so mockery that they greatly reduce the quality of the documentary. They also fail to present the large scale of the massacres of up to 500,000 people as mentioned by Wikipedia dot org.I agree with another reviewer who says this film is overrated.It's worth watching if you want to see with your own eyes some of what happened with the communist massacres in Indonesia.

1663533,A1AP64X957HYEC,B00E0MT3SE,"D. Langston ""Yakee""","[0, 0]","It's one thing to read in a book about the atrocities of another time or place or even watch it in a dramatic retelling where we suspend our disbelief and go along with the storyline.  It's a whole different experience to watch people in real time based on actual events in a documentary boast about their patriotic war exploits, and their direct contribution to killing hundreds of thousands to millions of ordinary ""communist"" citizens without a trial, without evidence, without any consideration - other than the apparent direction of the (state?) run newspaper? and other higher-ups.  Even more mind bending are the re-enactments of the killings in the attempt to retell and glorify their win over tyranny and evil, the communist threat, with the open support by the Indonesian public officials, the state-run television shows, the military leaders, and their candor about the rampant corruption and the ""gangsters"" being a necessary evil in society for the greater good.  The list goes on.Questions arise and analogies abound watching the movie flooding my brain with implications, for example, how often do Hollywood films glorify the eradication of evil?  What role does fiction, the media, mythology, self-narratives and state-narratives have in our lives?  Who decides when it is ok to kill and torture (openly addressed in the movie by one Indonesian death squad leader)?Whether their actions were necessary and legitimate, and whether there was a real threat in 1965 of Indonesia being overthrown by communists is not really addressed, which is where I diverge from the director.  There is an assumption of guilt in the documentary, which is difficult to deny or reject.  Having listened to the director speak (and I think he's brilliant), I disagree with him on that point.  The director says he believes all the characters know what they did was wrong.  I disagree with that sentiment.  I don't think people know right from wrong that clearly in general. Morality gets so clouded over by competing values in society, loyalty, religion, community, country, friendship, fairness, harm, etc..  His use of a remorseful, internally conflicted man to demonstrate some type of predisposed or natural morality demonstrates more so the murkiness of morality than the naturalness of it for me, which is more effective at raising questions than it would have been had he only talked to the most smugly self-righteous death squad leaders.  Even if you ignore social values altogether (if you can even do that) and take natural selection as the moral foundation, I think killing might be even more supported and pronounced.  I imagine moral fluidity would be a better adaption than moral inflexibility.  I tend to believe morality is an evolutionary adaptation which is one reason among many that casts doubt on any absolutist moral framework... so in that regard, I am in some agreement with the killer in the movie who compares his deeds with the US torture in Guantanamo (which I'm Wholly against by the way - I don't really care if the CIA thinks it was necessary as was seemingly suggested by Zero Dark Thirty).  The Killer is being defensive in the scene by Oppenheimer's line of questioning, but he's right, i think, that leaders of nations decide when it's OK to break with our moral codes for the greater good of our culture, for its protection, etc., for better or worse, right or wrong, greed, pleasure, whatever their reasons... hemorrhoids, their dog just died.  I am somewhat nauseated by the immorality of the average person in society (including myself sometimes) and our national leaders which frequently makes me question my own sense of right and justice.  Recently, studies and researchers have been saying, for example, that people are wired for poly-amory.  Does that make cheating on one's spouse right or wrong?  Using the word cheating would suggest yes, but starting from a premise of an open relationship and polygamy being considered wrong by most (at least most Christians here in the US), but the ""science"" is revealing otherwise.  How do we manage these conflicting drives... with religion, social norms, laws, guilt, shame, etc.?  Or is it even necessary to control in the first place?  Against what some may believe, I would argue that morality, social norms and political economy all form quite the muddy waters. I am much more aligned I believe with the director's moral inflexibility than most (at least that's how I perceive the director and myself, but as Jonathan Haidt points out, self-righteousness is the natural human order).The world is getting smaller, more connected, etc. which i think promotes a rejection of the anti-social nature of killing because it's getting harder for people to distinguish otherness from ourselves.  When groups are separated, i think it's easier for us as humans to separate the enemies from ourselves and overlook the unnaturalness of killing people like ourselves.  It's easier to pretend that they are not like us.  And if they're openly trying to kill us, pushing us to the extreme of kill or be killed.. well I'm not sure how Oppenhiemer could say in that scenario that it is wrong and everyone knows it (if that's indeed what he believes, which it seems like he may from listening to him speak).  And maybe the main actors, as corrupt and absurd as they appear, maybe that's what they thought in 1965, and still believe today.  It's hard to say from watching a few of them in the film.  The attitudes of the people in the movie did appear quite venal, self-interested and grotesque, and seeing how much the thinking seemed to pervade the highest powers of that society was jaw dropping.After watching The Act of Killing, I came across this interview with the psychology professor Lt. Col. Dave Grossman on youtube where he talks about people's natural moral aversion to killing, which manifests as nausea and retching.  He says the military recognizes this instinct and develops ways to shut it off and when the soldiers come home we have ways of honoring them so that we and they can accept their actions as having been necessary for the greater good of the people.The genius of the movie is that it forces us to recognize similarities we share with the actors in the film, making us grapple with the horror (or complexity) of it inside us all.  It's hard not to see that the people in the movie are just people, like everyone else with one exception... one of them was reveling in the great heavenly pleasures of raping children.  I totally agree with the director resisting the description of the characters as the ""banality of evil"" by replacing it with the ""humanity of evil.""  The characters seem so typical, which I think is part of the movie's potency.  It's hard to point a finger and say those people over there because they are all too similar to everyone else, including ourselves.If the director wants to suggest that we put an end to war, because ""all killing is wrong,"" well I'm with him on that push for peace but I must disagree on a simple claim about the idea that all killing is wrong.  Morality is too messy for that type of a simplistic dogma or prescription.  Circumstances and conditions play too important a role in making such a claim outright for me, but I guess that's why I tend to be a utilitarian with libertarian underpinnings.",5,Probably the best

1663534,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B00E0MT3SE,DVD Verdict,"[4, 4]","In The Act of Killing, the former death squad members, now folk heroes, are asked to dramatize their exploits. Since these men started out as gangsters hustling movie theater tickets, there's an odd and repellent circular feel to the proceedings. These men love the movies, name dropping actors like Al Pacino and John Wayne as reference points for their murderous actions; on the talk show, Congo playfully suggests he resembles Sidney Poitier (he decidedly does not).And so, we have history re-told as a musical, or a western, or a gangster film, or a horror movie, with the death squad members playing different roles; Congo gets done up in a dark wig (covering his greyed hair) and make-up to resemble his younger self. He also plays victim at points. Just like a &#34;real movie,&#34; there are dream sequences, production numbers, and heroic speeches.It's a fascinating perversion of humanity. Congo and his cohorts are remarkably candid about their deeds, offering up graphic descriptions of torture and murder in a strikingly facile manner. Congo talks about coming from watching an Elvis movie, and singing and dancing while he tortured people to death; Congo and the other killers seem to not have any real stake in politics whatsoever, no sense of self-righteousness or that the ends justified the means. They were merely mercenary thugs who parlayed a revolution into a money-making scheme. The film also notes that there was virtually no intervention from the western nations; if anything, there was tacit approval, likely because the death squads were eradicating &#34;communists.&#34;The film re-creations are bizarre and shocking, particularly the ones that feature Herman Koto, an obese paramilitary leader who does drag in his &#34;film&#34; scenes. Done up in elaborate make-up, headdresses, and wigs, as well as flowing, brightly colored gowns, Koto's female character turns up as villain, vamp, and a seemingly supernatural creature. If we did not know this man's history, it would be easy to see him as a comic relief actor, much like Italy's Bombolo.Koto and Congo spend time watching the rushes and discussing their hopes for the finished film, taking it all very seriously, but frankly, it's difficult to imagine this m&eacute;l&agrave;nge of scenes and styles being cut together to make a cohesive, narrative.The Act of Killing is fascinating, troubling, and infuriating on so many levels. On the one hand, it seems that these men are out to redeem themselves for actions that have no redemption&#8212;one paramilitary leader takes us on a tour of his opulent home, showing off delicate, one-of-a-kind glassware he's picked up on his world travels, offering himself as a genteel sophisticate. But then, we realize that these men really aren't seeking redemption, they're buying into their legend-status as heroes, even if they never set out to be. They make no apologies and few excuses for the atrocities they committed; on the contrary, they have bragging rights to the horrors.Long before midpoint, it becomes awfully overwhelming&#8212;the reprehensible men cheerfully describing their inhumanity; the re-creations of the atrocities; the absolute soullessness of Congo and company; and the overblown, histrionic film-within-a film, which frankly looks more Bollywood&#8212;or even Dollywood&#8212;than Hollywood. At times, it comes perilously close to being less like watching a movie and more like experiencing a Black Box-style sensory overload.The film was directed by Joshua Oppenheimer, Christine Cynn, and an Indonesian filmmaker who has chosen to remain anonymous, fearing reprisal (a number of crew members also retained their anonymity for the same reason); Werner Herzog (Grizzly Man) and Errol Morris (The Fog of War) served as executive producers.The two-Blu disc set includes the 166-minute director's cut as well as the 122-minute theatrical version. I watched the director's cut; generally, when given the option, that seems the way to go. I'm not so sure in this case. &#34;Overwhelming&#34; is again the word that comes to mind; I'm not sure what was removed for the theatrical release, but it's not hard to imagine losing 20 or so minutes from what I watched and still having a compelling, disturbing film.Image quality is fine for this 1.78:1/1080p transfer, considering it's almost all interviews, archival footage, and scenes from the faux-movie, and cinematography wasn't the main focus. The DTS-HD 5.1 audio track is strong, with virtually all dialogue in Indonesian with non-removable subtitles.The Act of Killing (Blu-ray) sports an impressive slate of supplements. Disc One, which contains the shorter theatrical version, includes an interview with Oppenheimer on Democracy Now; interviews with Herzog and Morris for Vice Presents; and deleted scenes, plus trailers for this film and other Drafthouse releases. The second disc, which contains the extended director's cut, also includes a commentary with Oppenheimer and Herzog. There is also a 64-page booklet with an essay by Morris, along with a code for a digital download. This is an excellent set of supplements, each one insightful and meaningful, adding to the viewing experiences as supplements should.-Tom Becker, DVD VERDICTRead the full review at

Indonesia is an exception and the reasons why this is so come over in this extraordinary ""re-creation"". It does not need much thought to connect these terrible events in 1966 with the terror inflicted on East Timor is its brutal battle for independence. This set contains a short theatrical version and a much longer directors cut which has been substantially recut and this is the one to watch. Considering the uneven source material a very good job has been made of balancing them all up. The sound is clear but unfortunately the very good subtitles are a bit too small and thin and are rather hard to read. The commentary is excellent and is best switched on with the dialogue being followed on the subtitles. The extras on the Theatrical version disc are excellent but unfortunately not subtitled. I will not discuss the film itself, it needs to be seen. A knowledge of Indonesia and the event itself will greatly assist your understanding of this extraordinary film.

1663541,A1FV9E94AS7B13,B00E0MT3SE,"Nan Chen ""cineaste""","[7, 7]","(This is a review of the director's version which may contain scenes not in the theatrical version) In 1965, a military revolt in Indonesia crushed a popular movement and coup attempt. The military's actions were inspired by propaganda produced with the help of the CIA and the groups that were responsible for the revolt were composed of various paramilitary groups and violent street gangs funded by the US government because of its fear of communist elements in the popular movement and in the government. However after these paramilitary groups took over the country, they imposed decades of brutal authoritarian and genocidal policies purging anyone suspected of communist allegiance (again, endorsed and supported by the US government. We know this through the US government's own records released through the Freedom of Information Act). More than 2 million died as a result of political, religious and ethnic cleansing mainly against alleged communists and their families, Christians and ethnic Chinese. To this day, Indonesia is only gradually beginning to come out of that hell.This film details the current lives of many of those who had done the dirty work of exterminating alleged communists and other undesirables within Indonesian society. Many of whom have now profited well and are treated as heroes in their country. Some remain as influential parts of the government today. A few of the most brutal murderers were given the opportunity to not only explain what they did but to show it through reenactments produced with the murderers as writers, producers and actors. Their crimes were never mechanized and systematized like the Nazis but they often used their hands and other crude instruments to murder and torture their victims.The viewer is constantly in a state of prolonged horror when watching this movie as no other film portrays evil as palpably and as clearly. The film makers could have interviewed historians and victims or made reenactments that used professional actors as most documentaries do but the genius of this film is the realization that nothing conveys evil better than evil itself so they had the perpetrators recreate what they have done.There are so many memorable scenes that will stay with a viewer forever.The murderers talks about how they went about their business of murdering people in all the details and they seemed to relish reliving the memories. They laugh and dance to the internal echoes of their victims screams. There are remarkable admissions. At one point two of the leaders of the killing gangs talked about a famous anti-communist film all Indonesian children were made to watch and how it had instilled in them a violent hatred of communists. The film portrayed communists killing, torturing and raping Indonesians. One of the killers then mentioned what complete bs that film was and that it was a lie through and through used as propaganda and that they were the cruel and sadistic ones not the communists. The other killer agrees with him but says that they shouldn't talk this way in front of the camera or to foreigners. Other ex paramilitary and gang leaders talked about how much they enjoyed raping 14 year old girls and murdering the father's of their girlfriends.Also interestingly, many of those who acted in the reenactments began to sob and cry during their scenes. Their reactions seemed to be wholly genuine outpouring of emotion instead of acting. After one particularly griping shoot involving a reenactment of a brutal interrogation, Anwar Congo broke down and wondered aloud whether his victims had felt the same level of fear and degradation he did during the scene. The director talking from behind the camera was quick to point out to him that his victims suffered far worse because Congo knew that this was a film but his victims knew they were going to die and were actually tortured to death.In another interesting scene Congo goes back to his ""headquarters"" where he and his henchmen once interrogated hundreds of people and murdered them on the roof of the building. As the interview went on, he began to repeatedly dry heave. The more he talked the more it was interrupted with his hacking gags. This was presumably his physically repulsion by the memories of his actions which caused the gag reflex but it was almost like something out of a scene from an exorcism like a battle between a demon and him was occurring internally and the demon was trying to stay in and he was trying to expel it. It was surreal like much of the rest of the film.Another subject and friend of Congo talked about his complete lack of guilt for what he did. The film shows him in mundane actions such as shopping in a modern mall with his wife and daughter or driving down a city street while the viewer is constantly reminded by the brutal and gory reenactments past actions in scenes before and immediately after. The director asks him at one point what he would feel is he was sent to the Hague to crimes against humanity and he said he would gladly go because it would make him famous around the world. He also mentioned how his crimes are like those committed in Nazi Germany and the United States at points in their history and that he likely won't be punished as well like the perpetrators of those crimes against humanity.Many of the characters this film really are demonic beings (if you think my uses of the words 'demonic' and 'evil' are hyperbole, I suggest watching this film first then see if they are not perfectly fitting). This film might make a great antidote to those postmodern moral nihilists who deny the existence of evil.But the most disturbing thing that one gets out of the film is a misanthropic realization that these people are not much different from the vast majority of humanity and that their society isn't that much different in its superficial callousness towards violence. Their crimes have been repeated throughout history in Germany, Japan and the United States and many other parts of the world. Moreover, the film shows how the cruelest actions can be blended with crude entertainment and political propaganda to produce a public acceptance of evil through conflating and sanitizing it. There is no guarantee that had any of us been tested in the same way we'd do the same or perhaps look the other way in cowardness or indifference instead of fighting against it.This is perhaps one of the few films ever made where one is required a kind of courage, not a kind of superficial courage like what it takes to watch a really scary horror movie but a kind of moral courage to see and even greater courage to make.",5,One of the most remarkable documentaries ever made,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,6624,"['review', 'director', 'version', 'may', 'contain', 'scenes', 'not', 'theatrical',

1663543,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00E0MT3SE,Paul Allaer,"[34, 37]","""The Act of Killing"" (2013 release; 115 min.) is a documentary from writer-director Joshua Oppenheimer who sets out to interview/expose several of the ""evil-doers"" behind the mass killings that took place in Indonesia in 1965-66. As the documentary opens, we get to know Anwar Congo, one of those directly involved in the killings. Anwar and several of his croonies have decided, apparently with some coaxing and suggesting from Oppenheimer, to make a movie about the events from 65-66, so as to preserve hisotry and making sure everyone knows what really happened, including how exactly these killings were executed.Several comments: first and foremost, in what kind of a world do we live that these mass-murderers boast about what they did in the mid-60s without any fear of apprehension, let alone any regret over what they did? To the contrary, we see Anwar Congo and his croonies making the rounds of various media, including a national TV show, where the host merrily goes along. Likewise with Indonesia's politicians at the highest levels. Here is a Indonesian Vice-President addressing the Pancasila paramilitary oraganzation that did much of the killings in the mid-60s, there is the Minister of Information showing support for the making of the film, and on and on. It simple blows the mind. Second, it must be that these killers truly have no inkling why Oppenheimer is making this documentary, as they are on seemingly very friendly terms and a first-name basis with Oppenheimer throughout the movie. Third, the re-enactments make for difficult movie-watching at times, in particular the further we get into the movie. This is most definitely not for the faint of heart, so viewer beware.I saw this movie just this past weekend at the Downtown Independent in Los Angeles, and the particular matinee showing I was at was very well attended, somewhat of a surprise to me, given the subject matter of this movie. The showing actually started with ""A special announcement from director Joshua Oppenheimer"", in which Oppenheimer introduces the movie and concludes ""I won't say 'enjoy the film' as it's not necessarily that kind of a movie, but I would hope that you have a powerful movie experience"", and that it certainly is, and then some! This movie is one of the more unusual documentaries I have seen in a long time. Assuming you can handle the at times schocking and always revolting characters we get to know in the movie, this is definitely a movie you want to (need to) see, be it at home or in the theatre, and I fully expect this documentary will be in the running for the Best Documentary Oscar early next year.

Made with the help of Anonymous, this is probably the most psychologically complex documentary I&#8217;ve ever seen.2. In 1960&#8217;s Indonesia, there was a failed military coup. As a result, thugs and small-time gangsters were turned into paramilitary death squads. They roamed the country and killed millions of people who were suspected of being &#8220;communist&#8221;. Anwar Congo was the most feared leader of one these death squads.3. Filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer managed to make contact with Anwar, and asked him to recount his memories of that time. As the death squads are openly celebrated as heroes, Anwar eagerly agreed to make this movie.4. The movie starts out with Anwar and one of his flunkies openly boasting about the ways they tortured and killed people. The stories then turn to actual recreations of some of the murders and massacres.5. As the movie progresses, we meet other people who were involved with the murders. They all have their own ways of dealing with what they&#8217;ve done. They believe that the key to not be haunted by the ghosts of those they murdered is to never feel guilty.6. In between the recreation of history, we also get a close look at the way Indonesia is run today &#8211; the rampant corruption, cynicism, and extortion. People love to explain repeatedly that the word &#8220;gangster&#8221; means &#8220;free man&#8221;. We come to understand that the death squads are part of an entire horrific pattern in the country&#8217;s psyche. This is normal life to them.7. As Anwar recreates his &#8220;adventures&#8221;, he moves from playing himself to playing the victim&#8217;s role. Then he wants to act out the nightmares he has. The torture and murder scenes become increasingly elaborate. You can see him progress from self-important psychopath to trembling human being that questions everything he&#8217;s done. But he can&#8217;t apologize for it.8. The movie is alternately absurd, nightmarish, horrific, and amusingly surreal. Anwar is sometimes glib (like discussing the best clothing to wear when you kill people), and sometimes regretful (such as when he admits that he usually didn&#8217;t close the eyes of the people&#8217;s heads once he cut them off).9. The movie is long, running almost three hours. It&#8217;s hard to watch, because of the graphic discussion and re-enacting of torture and murder. It&#8217;s bizarre and unexpectedly beautiful. It&#8217;s an unprecedented look at the psychology of mass murderers and the effects of trauma on those who cause it.",5,"Chilling, surreal, and important",1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,2580,"['Nine', 'Things', '34', 'Act', 'Killing', '34', '1', 'Made', 'help', 'Anonymous', 'probably', 'most', 'psychologically', 'complex', 'documentary', '8217', 'ever', 'seen.2', '1960', '8217', 's', 'Indonesia', 'was', 'failed', 'military', 'coup', 'result', 'thugs', 'small-time', 'gangsters', 'were', 'turned', 'paramilitary', 'death', 'squads', 'roamed', 'country', 'killed', 'millions', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'suspected', 'being', '8220', 'communist', '8221', 'Anwar', 'Congo', 'was', 'most', 'feared', 'leader', 'one', 'death', 'squads.3', 'Filmmaker', 'Joshua', 'Oppenheimer', 'managed', 'make', 'contact', 'Anwar', 'asked', 'recount', 'memories', 'time', 'death', 'squads', 'are', 'openly', 'celebrated', 'heroes', 'Anwar', 'eagerly', 'agreed', 'make', 'movie.4', 'movie', 'out', 'Anwar', 'one', 'flunkies', 'openly', 'boasting', 'ways', 'tortured', 'killed', 'people', 'stories', 'then', 'turn', 'actual', 'recreations', 'murders', 'massacres.5', 'movie', 'meet', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'murders', 'have', 'own', 'ways', 'dealing', 'what', '8217', 'done', 'believe', 'key', 'not', 'be', 'haunted', 'ghosts', 'murdered', 'never', 'feel', 'guilty.6', 'recreation', 'history', 'also', 'get', 'close', 'look', 'way', 'Indonesia', 'run', 'today', '8211', 'rampant', 'corruption', 'cynicism', 'extortion', 'People', 'love', 'explain', 'repeatedly', 'word', '8220', 'gangster', '8221', '8220', 'free', 'man', '8221', 'come', 'understand', 'death', 'squads', 'are', 'part', 'entire', 'horrific', 'pattern', 'country', '8217', 'psyche', 'normal', 'life', 'them.7', 'Anwar', '8220', '8221', 'playing', 'playing', 'victim', '8217', 's', 'role', 'Then', 'act', 'out', 'nightmares', 'torture', 'murder', 'scenes', 'become', 'increasingly', 'elaborate', 'can', 'see', 'progress', 'self-important', 'psychopath', 'trembling', 'human', 'being', 'questions', 'everything', '8217', 'done', 'can', '8217', 'apologize', 'it.8', 'movie', 'alternately', 'absurd', 'nightmarish', 'horrific', 'amusingly', 'surreal', 'Anwar', 'sometimes', 'glib', 'discussing', 'best', 'clothing', 'wear', 'when', 'kill', 'people', 'sometimes', 'regretful', 'such', 'when', 'usually', 'didn', '8217', 'close', 'eyes', 'people', '8217', 'heads', 'once', 'cut', 'off', '.9', 'movie', 'long', 'running', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', '8217', 's', 'hard', 'watch', 'graphic', 'discussion', 're-enacting', 'torture', 'murder', '8217', 'bizarre', 'unexpectedly', 'beautiful', '8217', 'unprecedented', 'look', 'psychology', 'mass', 'murderers', 'effects', 'trauma', 'who', 'cause']",Act of Killing

1663548,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00E0MT3SE,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","****1/2Imagine walking up to a known killer and asking him to reenact one of his murders, then questioning him about all the gory details. Well, that&#8217;s exactly what Joshua Oppenheimer, the maker of the documentary &#8220;The Act of Killing,&#8221; did - over and over again, in fact.The killers in question all committed their atrocities fifty-some-odd years ago as part of an anti-Communist purge in Indonesia perpetrated by the military dictatorship that had just risen to power there (it&#8216;s made clear at the very beginning of the film that the &#8220;Communists&#8220; were often just farmers, union members, Chinese immigrants, intellectuals and anyone not supportive of the military regime). In one year&#8217;s time, over a million such people had been slaughtered. Today many of the killers, all of whom have gone unpunished for their crimes, are now in positions of great influence and power in the government. The focus of the film is on two men and their minions in particular: Anwar Congo and Ad Zulkadry, members of one of the death squads in North Sumatra, personally responsible for the deaths of thousands. Congo went on to found a paramilitary right-wing organization known as Pemuda Pancasila, which boasts many adherents and followers - mainly young people - even today.The makers of &#8220;The Act of Killing&#8221; have gathered together this group of self-proclaimed &#8220;gangsters,&#8221; who have decided to make a mainstream movie on the subject with themselves and their buddies as the stars. But what the documentarians actually wanted was to give these men the opportunity to relate not only how they committed the murders but how they feel about it all nearly five decades later. And it is their responses in this regard that make this such a stunning and disturbing movie to sit through. For not only is there virtually no remorse - or even much of an attempt at rationalization - expressed over the people they tortured and killed, these men can barely contain their feelings of nostalgia and pride as they regale their audiences with their memories. There are a few moments of quiet reflection: one man discusses the nightmares he occasionally has about the people he strangled; another dismisses concerns of morality by arguing that one generation&#8217;s war crimes are another generation&#8217;s accepted practices, and that the victors ultimately get to determine what is right and what is wrong in the long view of history (he brings up America&#8217;s decimation of its indigenous peoples and Bush&#8217;s sanctioning of torture at Guantanamo Bay as examples to buttress his argument). Apparently the PR spokesman for the group, this individual has at least enough of a perspective to fear that the movie that they are making may actually make themselves look cruel and the Communists sympathetic in the eyes of the general public if they re-create the tortures and killings too effectively.Yet, such moments are the exceptions. Most of the time, we&#8217;re learning about how gratifying it can be to take another man&#8217;s life or rape a child or burn down a terrified family&#8217;s house as they watch. And it&#8217;s all supposed to be okay since &#8220;gangster&#8221; really means &#8220;free man,&#8221; a fact we are told at least a dozen times throughout the course of the movie. That is somehow supposed to justify not only the killings in the past but the corruption and abuse of power many of them are perpetrating in the present. And, most shockingly of all, the media and much of the general populace of the area seem to go along with it - though how much of their approbation is actually the product of fear is anyone&#8217;s guess.The irony is that, while these &#8220;gangsters&#8221; keep declaiming against the evils of Communism, they have set up their own positions of power in a way perfectly aligned with how that system has worked wherever it has been tried. For instance, we see one of the men wending his way through a crowded marketplace, going from one honest, hardworking shopkeeper to another, extorting money through threats, and, later, running (unsuccessfully) for parliament so he&#8216;ll be able to wring even more money out of the decent citizens of his country.Many of the men point to Hollywood as their inspiration, explaining how they adopted many of the tough-guy styles and attitudes they saw in pictures in their youth - and even some of their torture and killing techniques. Score another one for American exports!We&#8217;ve seen so many dramatized accounts of genocide and war crimes in movies and on TV that seeing these actual perpetrators re-enacting their atrocities takes the subject to a whole new level. And the depressing part is to realize that these are not just isolated cases, that the world is indeed full of such men eager to trumpet the evil they&#8217;ve done. It&#8217;s true that, near the end, Congo has what appears to be a breakdown of remorse, finally comprehending what it is he did all those years ago.  But is it too little, too late? And how much of it is genuine and how much of it is staged? (These are &#8220;actors,&#8221; after all). Unfortunately for these men, redemption cannot be had for the price of a movie ticket.It&#8217;s safe to say that &#8220;The Act of Killing&#8221; provided me with the most surreal experience I&#8217;ve ever had watching a movie. At times, I found myself thinking it must be some sort of put-on, an elaborate piece of street theater designed to trick the unwary into believing it&#8217;s real. Alas, it isn&#8217;t a hoax, and, for that reason alone, it emerges as one of the most deeply disturbing looks into the dark heart of humanity ever put on film.",4,A truly surreal

Rena Kaneko  The Act of Killing films 1965-66 memories from the perspective of murderers who see themselves as cinema celebrities, swaggering, dancing, gleefully re-portraying their killing of hundreds of thousands often with their own hands, as they boastfully relive their ascent to political power.Director Oppenheimer was not surprised privileged officials dissembled in response to direct questions. Instead Oppenheimer offered to film whatever memories would be offered, in whatever form desired, allowing the individuals being filmed to write, direct and act out their killings. The production involved ethereal Busby Berkeley dance numbers, dream sequences, ""making of"" footage, and terrified supporting actors, including women and children, whose genuine distress is obviously not acting. The women and children used to portray victims of rape, torture, burning are the wives and children of the perpetrators.

Over the course of 8 years of filming perpetrators recreating their brutality ""we are more sadistic than Nazis"" it becomes clear to the actors that the viewing audience may judge their cinematic bravado as evil and their victims as victims. Yet they continue filming as if driven by emotional need for catharsis to keep telling their view of what happened.For two hours I was mesmerized watching murderer's empathy dawn for what their cinematic macho violence must have cost victims: terror, helplessness, fear.

I have never seen a documentary where the perpetrators of horrific acts willingly tell what they did with no fear of retribution, or, so far, any regret. On the contrary, they retell their deeds as if they are to be celebrated. This is because in their country they work for the successful political group and are considered hero's, though they committed atrocities. they tell their stories of murder in front of their grandchildren, relatives, and other children, as if these are suitable stories for children - as in ""your grandpa killed so many people and it was extremely bloody and stinky and messy beating them to death, so clever grandpa devised a way of strangling them instead (grandpa demonstrates), significantly reducing the amount of blood and mess."" (I'm taking some license here, as the grandfather didn't tell his grandson this story on camera, but instead allowed the child to view the re-enactment alongside him.)to me, one of the most chilling perps (so far) is the newspaperman who admits on camera to planting lies in his paper to frame innocent people and to make peasant Indonesians hate other ordinary peasant Indonesians who happened to be powerless communists (powerless because they were unable to prevent their own murder), and that he tells us what he did with no sense of self-loathing. Just the opposite, he brags that a wink from him to the muscle got people killed. He boasts, reveling in his power to have people murdered; it is something to display, as he displays the many photos on his walls.  another awful reveal, currently ongoing, is the shakedown of poor Chinese booth renters in the village where the filming takes place. We are actually shown how relatively powerless people in this village are leaned on and threatened with violence. To avoid beatings, they are forced to pay protection money. This is captured on camera. The look on the shopkeeper's faces as they fork over the little bit of money they have, money that could feed their families or pay their rent, given instead to thugs, is extremely sad. the thugs are so clueless that they don't mind showing how abusive they are. really, really interesting.

This is essentially a documentary about the Indonesian killing squads from the 1960&#8217;s and what they did, but with them re-enacting their deeds.The &#8216;gangsters&#8217; are all Hollywood movie fans and so Director and visionary Joshua Oppenheimer invites these men to make their own films about what they did. They can use any medium they like. So we have exotic dancers emerging from the mouth of a wooden fish building. Actors parading in front of a waterfall pretending to be in heaven and a re-enactment of a village massacre, to name but three. Plus the obligatory scenes of torture and execution, with some bizarre make up in places. I do not know how he got these men to talk about what they did or to show in such graphic detail.I often make notes if I am going to write a review, normally only a few sentences, but I wrote two pages on this. The main guy is Anwar Congo who shows us his Hollywood inspired garrotting and dyes his hair especially for the re-enactments. They all talk with disarming frankness about their crimes insisting that they, as gangsters, were always going to be better than communists.They ignore the contradiction with Islam being into drugs, alcohol, mass murder etc. They still extort the ethnic Chinese and were content to be filmed doing this. They strut around with impunity and some of the scenes they get people to act for them and they all seem to be genuinely terrified, especially the children. One of them keeps dressing up as his women victims in a grotesque parody of what really must have taken place. There is some remorse but to say too little, too late, is obviously not enough. They experience a tiny fraction of what they did to others and claim to be able to empathise, until its pointed out that they know they are not going to be actually tortured to death.So &#8216;meet the killers&#8217; would be a good alternative title, but I was left moved, disturbed and horrified in equal amounts and yet still amazed that this could all be true.

1663555,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00E0MT3SE,Turfseer,"[2, 2]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 4.5 out of 5.0In 1965, following a military coup in Indonesia, various gangsters and paramilitary leaders and their followers were given free rein to kill as many people they deemed 'Communists' as they could. The result was that approximately 500,000 people were murdered in these anti-Communist purges including many ethnic Chinese. Joshua Oppenheimer, the film's creator, was living in Indonesia since 2001 and attempted to interview some of the victims and relatives of the victims of these massacres but soon found out that it would be dangerous to do so. Instead, it was suggested to him that he seek out the murderers themselves and much to his surprise, they were more than willing to cooperate.Oppenheimer developed the idea that if he allowed his interviewees the ability to create cinematic scenes illustrating their role in the carnage, this might get them to open up even more. After meeting with approximately forty of these self-admitted killers, he came upon one Anwar Congo, a white-haired, grandfatherly looking man, who bears a slight resemblance to Nelson Mandela (one good way of looking at Congo, is that he's the anti-Mandela). Congo explained that he was a young man back at the time of the anti-Communist purges, working as a ticket scalper, and soon became a self-appointed 'gangster', claiming to have murdered approximately 1,000 so-called 'Communists'. Joining Congo is Herman Koto, a paramilitary leader, much feared in the area of North Sumatra where he's from.One of the disturbing things about Congo is that he has a charming and magnetic personality. Congo openly boasts about how he enjoyed committing these murders and is now revered as an elder statesmen by the Pancasila Youth organization, a right-wing para-military group that reportedly boasts 3 million members strong. Oppenheimer films the current head of this youth organization who reminds one of Baldur von Schirach, the head of the Hitler Youth in Nazi Germany.Congo demonstrates on film how he used to strangle his victims with wire, in order to prevent his victims from bleeding too much. When he visits the current governor of North Sumatra, the governor makes the point that Congo was much feared in his day as a 'gangster', but he had no fear of him, because Congo was basically like an uncle to him. Congo and the governor define the word 'gangster' as 'free men'. It's obvious that Congo's behavior is approved by all levels of the current government in Indonesia today. A newspaper editor who used to order the deaths of various people he deemed Communists back in the 60s, is shown to be a close friend of the current president of Indonesia, who received training by the US military in the United States prior to his election as president.Congo and his fellow henchmen seem to have no guilt feelings about insisting that they were far more cruel than the people they killed. But Congo seems to be the only one who was affected by the killings. He suffers from nightmares and at the end of the film, is seen retching at the site where many were killed. Another paramilitary leader, Adi Zulkadry, has no guilt feelings whatsoever. While driving with Oppenheimer who questions him from the back seat of a vehicle, Zulkadry boasts that he's not bound by the Hague Convention, since ""history is written by the winners."" Furthermore he points out that the US under Bush provided chemical weapons to Sadaam Hussein, who used them against his own people. So if the US was complicit in war crimes, why should he be singled out.The documentary takes on a surreal quality during the re-enactments created by the aging gangsters. One particularly disturbing scene involves women and children who volunteered to illustrate rapes and murders in a particular village. Even Congo seems a bit perturbed when children begin crying during these re-enactments.Other crazy stuff involves shakedowns by a high-ranking paramilitary soldier of ethnic Chinese vendors in the local markets. Right on camera he demands money from these poor businessmen and when he feels they haven't given him enough, he asks for more.Mr. Oppenheimer has provided a great service in putting a human face on the purveyors of genocide. Instead of horrible devils, Congo and his ilk appear to be charming raconteurs. These are people who revel in being sadistic and boasting about their many misdeeds (in their eyes), is a source of power.Don't ever think that any of these men will be brought to the bar of justice. The United States has been a long-time supporter of Indonesia, particularly during the cold war, when their anti-Communist stance was in full force. The same applies to China--despite the fact that many ethnic Chinese were slaughtered during the genocide that occurred in 1965, the Communist Chinese government resumed diplomatic relations with Indonesia in 1990, and the two countries are strong trading partners.'The Act of Killing' represents an indictment of a society that thrives on the intolerance of others. By exposing the mindset of these people, people here in the West should have no illusions about who they are dealing with in such countries that support and promote a fascistic mentality.Ultimately, I believe Mr. Oppenheimer's hope was by gaining the trust of these killers, he could perhaps influence them to develop some kind of moral conscience. Only Anwar Congo seemed to have any guilt feelings about his role in the killings as he admittedly suffered from nightmares and was seen retching at the site of the massacres. But even Congo still doesn't seem to make the connection--he can't stop the nightmares because he truly is not repentant.'The Act of Killing' may have benefited from more judicious editing as it's a bit long in places. Nevertheless, Oppenheimer has exposed the dark side of human nature by bravely befriending people who can best be described as scary and dangerous.",4,Bold and creative director puts human face on
