But this film proves he was adept at drama, too. And his talent for comedy and snappy dialogue gives this courtroom thriller some nice touches of humor, mostly from the curmudgeonly lead played by Laughton, but also through the governess played by Laughton's real-life wife, Elsa Lanchester ( the grouchy old maid is pretty entertaining, too).This movie is just working on all cylinders from start to finish: great cast with solid perfomances from the leads and the supporting actors, a fast-paced script adapted by Wilder from Agatha Christie's play, and Wilders direction which adds a light tone to a murder mystery played out in a courtroom.A movie that has held up very well over the last 60 years, and can still entertain viewers beyond the ""classic"" film crowd.",5,Wilder proves he can do drama,1315958400,"09 14, 2011",2011,1080,"['have', 'seen', 'almost', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'films', 'ones', 'where', 'credited', 'scriptwriter', 'ones', 'directed', 'reaon', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'Witness', 'Prosecution', 'just', 'recently', 'Now', 'feel', 'have', 'been', 'missing', 'one', 'better', 'films.Wilder', 'mostly', 'remembered', 'comedies', 'film', 'was', 'adept', 'drama', 'too', 'talent', 'comedy', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'courtroom', 'nice', 'touches', 'humor', 'mostly', 'curmudgeonly', 'lead', 'played', 'Laughton', 'also', 'governess', 'played', 'Laughton', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'grouchy', 'old', 'maid', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'too', '.This', 'movie', 'just', 'working', 'cylinders', 'start', 'finish', 'great', 'cast', 'solid', 'perfomances', 'leads', 'supporting', 'actors', 'fast-paced', 'script', 'adapted', 'Wilder', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'play', 'Wilders', 'direction', 'light', 'tone', 'murder', 'mystery', 'played', 'out', 'courtroom.A', 'movie', 'held', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'last', '60', 'years', 'can', 'still', 'entertain', 'viewers', 'classic', 'film', 'crowd']",Witness for the Prosecution VHS

310921,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302413435,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I love Billy Wilder.  He was such a powerful filmmaker who understood all sorts of genres and how to mold them into his signature style, creating films that are still so genuine and entertaining today.  His comedic timing is probably what he is best known for, since films like `The Apartment' and `Some Like It Hot' are considered masterpieces and probably the first films you think of when you hear his name.  But, Wilder was also very adept at creating stirring dramatic fare.`Sunset Blvd.' anyone.That brings me to `Witness for the Prosecution', a beautifully crafted courtroom drama starring Charles Laughton, Tyrone Power and a ravishing Marlene Dietrich.  Adapted from an Agatha Christie play, `Witness for the Prosecution' tells the story of a London barrister preparing to retire when he gets sucked back into the game by an intriguing case he can't pass up.  Charged with the murder of a rich widow, Leonard Vole needs the best to prove his innocence.  His wife, Christine, may be his only hope, but shockingly she has other plans.Dark, moody and intense, Wilder brings so much passion to this film.  He also directs his cast to stunning results.  Laughton is superb (thus, the Oscar nomination) and Power is convincing, but it is Dietrich who steals this whole movie with her cold stare and determined ambiguity.  You are never quite sure of the angle she is playing until that final moment and it all comes full circle and your jaw drops and just...BAM.Oh yeah, don't spoil the end for ANYONE...it is that crucial to the overall impact of the film!",5,And then there's that ending...,1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,1560,"['love', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'was', 'such', 'powerful', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'understood', 'sorts', 'genres', 'how', 'mold', 'signature', 'style', 'creating', 'films', 'are', 'still', 'so', 'genuine', 'entertaining', 'today', 'comedic', 'timing', 'probably', 'what', 'best', 'known', 'films', 'Apartment', 'Hot', 'are', 'considered', 'masterpieces', 'probably', 'first', 'films', 'think', 'when', 'hear', 'name', 'Wilder', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'adept', 'creating', 'stirring', 'dramatic', 'fare.', 'Sunset', 'Blvd', 'brings', 'Witness', 'Prosecution', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'starring', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'ravishing', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'Adapted', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'play', 'Witness', 'Prosecution', 'story', 'London', 'barrister', 'preparing', 'retire', 'when', 'sucked', 'back', 'game', 'intriguing', 'case', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'Charged', 'murder', 'rich', 'widow', 'Leonard', 'Vole', 'best', 'prove', 'innocence', 'wife', 'Christine', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'hope', 'shockingly', 'other', 'plans.Dark', 'moody', 'intense', 'Wilder', 'so', 'much', 'passion', 'film', 'also', 'cast', 'stunning', 'results', 'Laughton', 'superb', 'thus', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Power', 'convincing', 'Dietrich', 'who', 'whole', 'movie', 'cold', 'stare', 'determined', 'ambiguity', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'angle', 'playing', 'final', 'moment', 'full', 'circle', 'jaw', 'drops', 'just', 'BAM.Oh', 'yeah', 'do', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'end', 'ANYONE', 'crucial', 'overall', 'impact', 'film']",Witness for the Prosecution VHS

He fell in love with her (not to mention falling into bed with her), married her and brought her back to London with him after the war.Vole is charged with the murder of a silly old widow he had befriended, and who rewrote her will to leave him the bulk of her estate. Sir Wilfrid has recently had a heart attack and has just come home in the charge of an over-protective nurse (Elsa Lanchester, who was Laughton's wife) when he is persuaded to defend Vole. Sir Wilfrid meets Vole's wife Christine, and decides she makes an unconvincing witness for the defense. She turns out to be quite a bit more convincing as a witness for the prosecution.The title gave you that much, but how the courtroom drama plays out is the heart of the matter.

This film has everything you could possibly want in a courtroom drama: a feisty but lovable defense attorney, known as barristers in Britain; a defendant equally as likable; and a heinous crime at the center of the plot. The immortal Charles Laughton seems born to play Sir Wilfrid, a cantankerous but lovable barrister regarded as one of the best defense attorneys in London. His doctor and nurse try to dissuade him from taking anymore clients, but when he receives an intriguing case, he can't resist. He loves trials as much as cigars and brandy. Part of the fun concerns his nurse constantly trying to keep his cigars and him far apart.Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power in his last film), an American and former G.I. who decided to stay in Britain after the war, is in trouble. He is accused of murdering a wealthy widow, Mrs French, for her money. His wife Christine is a German he literally saved from the rubble towards the end of the war. Wilfrid listens and believes Vole's story about how he met the widow and about their friendship. In the end he claims their relationship was only platonic and claims innocence; Christine is his devoted wife, not the widow.Wilfrid agrees to take the case. After Vole is arrested for murder, his wife Christine Vole (played by the incomparable Marlene Dietrich) calls on the barrister. She seems strangely detached from her husband. Wilfrid decides against calling her as a witness. During the trial, the prosecution paints Vole as a hard-up inventor who dreams of having the money he knows will be bequeathed him from the widow in the event of her death. He even stops at a travel agency and looks at all the cruises and vacation spots. But then a surprise witness appears: Christine comes to the courtroom as a witness--for the prosecution. Apparently in Britain, wives cannot be called to testify against their husbands but in some interesting legal maneuvering, Christine is able to testify.A compelling film from start to finish. If you have never seen this film before, the ending still holds up as one of the greatest twists in a courtroom drama. It makes sense that the original play was written by Agatha Christie whose twists are always the ones completely impossible to predict. While Power is certainly convincing as the young defendant, Laughton and Dietrich steal the show. This is really their film. And after you see it, please, as the film asks, do not reveal the ending to other would-be viewers.",5,"Based on Agatha Christie's Play, ""Witness"" is Possibly the Greatest Courtroom Drama Ever Filmed",1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,2569,"['have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'advise', 'not', 'ask', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'tell', 'Just', 'see', 'film', 'everything', 'could', 'possibly', 'want', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'feisty', 'lovable', 'defense', 'attorney', 'known', 'barristers', 'Britain', 'defendant', 'equally', 'likable', 'heinous', 'crime', 'center', 'plot', 'immortal', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'born', 'play', 'Sir', 'Wilfrid', 'cantankerous', 'lovable', 'barrister', 'regarded', 'one', 'best', 'defense', 'attorneys', 'London', 'doctor', 'nurse', 'try', 'dissuade', 'taking', 'anymore', 'clients', 'when', 'intriguing', 'case', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'trials', 'as', 'much', 'cigars', 'brandy', 'Part', 'fun', 'nurse', 'constantly', 'trying', 'keep', 'cigars', 'far', 'apart.Leonard', 'Vole', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'last', 'film', 'American', 'former', 'G.I', 'who', 'decided', 'stay', 'Britain', 'war', 'trouble', 'accused', 'murdering', 'wealthy', 'widow', 'Mrs', 'French', 'money', 'wife', 'Christine', 'German', 'literally', 'saved', 'rubble', 'towards', 'end', 'war', 'Wilfrid', 'listens', 'Vole', 'story', 'how', 'met', 'widow', 'friendship', 'end', 'relationship', 'was', 'only', 'platonic', 'claims', 'innocence', 'Christine', 'devoted', 'wife', 'not', 'widow.Wilfrid', 'take', 'case', 'Vole', 'arrested', 'murder', 'wife', 'Christine', 'Vole', 'played', 'incomparable', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'barrister', 'strangely', 'detached', 'husband', 'Wilfrid', 'calling', 'witness', 'trial', 'prosecution', 'paints', 'Vole', 'hard-up', 'inventor', 'who', 'having', 'money', 'will', 'be', 'bequeathed', 'widow', 'event', 'death', 'even', 'travel', 'agency', 'cruises', 'vacation', 'spots', 'then', 'surprise', 'witness', 'Christine', 'courtroom', 'witness', 'prosecution', 'Apparently', 'Britain', 'wives', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'called', 'testify', 'husbands', 'interesting', 'legal', 'maneuvering', 'Christine', 'able', 'testify.A', 'compelling', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'ending', 'still', 'up', 'one', 'greatest', 'twists', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'sense', 'original', 'play', 'was', 'written', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'twists', 'are', 'always', 'ones', 'completely', 'impossible', 'predict', 'Power', 'certainly', 'convincing', 'young', 'defendant', 'Laughton', 'Dietrich', 'steal', 'show', 'really', 'film', 'see', 'please', 'film', 'asks', 'do', 'not', 'reveal', 'ending', 'other', 'would-be', 'viewers']",Witness for the Prosecution VHS
310937,A1EOLRV216BXJ9,6302413435,Classic Movie watcher,"[5, 6]","As strongly advised by the narrator in the movie, we viewers are not to disclose the ending of the plot. And you'll be guaranteed a big twist and surprise that is beyond your imagination!Charles Laughton is the renowned persistent barrister with an even more persistent nurse and watchful housekeeper. He, against the advice of his doctor and his nurse, acted as the defence lawyer in an apparently hopeless to win trial. Tyrone Power was the accused murderer with a beautiful foreigner wife Marlene Dietrich. The time was a few years after the World War II ended and the place London when the public was still at large unsympathetic to Germans.The three stars acted superbly with impeccable lines. To top it all, the movie is given an ending that is wonderful, unexpected and at the same time serves the justice well. It can only be said that the punishment fits the crime and human nature (or weaknesses and prejudices, to be more specific) as portrayed in the movie is still highly relevant nowadays. To me, this is the most intriguing work by Agatha Christie.This movie can hardly be remade and deliver as much impact. There simply is not another trio who could play against each other so well. The conversations when Charles Laughton first inquired of the testimony of the husband and wife, separately, at his apartment were already as exciting as the subsequent court room drama. Credits must also be given to the director Billy Wilder (Sabrina, the Apartment, Some Like It Hot) who was a master of portraying characters, dialogues, wit and detail. No one could impress more than Marlene Dietrich as the intelligent wife with an unmistakable German accent. There is also a rare scene of her showing her legs. Tyrone Power grabbed the audience's attention with his plea for his innocence. And Charles Laughton is Charles Laughton - a big boy who pursued the case, as well as indulged himself in a few drinks and cigars, ferociously and fervantly. He is also the brain of the movie and the truth first dawned on him only till the end.It might also interest you that the nurse, Elsa Lanchester starred in the Bride of Frankestein and played as Charles Laughton's wife, Anne of Cleves, in the Private Life of Henry VIII. Another barrister in the movie, John Williams, actually assumed the role of Audrey Hepburn's father in Sabrina.

DeRiemer,"[10, 10]","""I'll snatch her thermometer,"" snarls the aging, portly, brilliant, irascible London barrister Sir Wilfred Robarts, just back in his office after spending time in a hospital recovering from a heart attack, ""and plunge it between her shoulder blades!""In Witness for the Prosecution, based on an Agatha Christie story and popular stage play, Sir Wilfred (Charles Laughton) is referring to his personal nurse and attendant, the chirpy and determined Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lanchester). Sir Wilfred has strict instructions to give up everything he holds dearest, namely brandy, cigars and the excitement of criminal defense cases. Nurse Plimsoll is there to see that he does, as well as to give him his injections, make sure he swallows his pills and tuck him in for his afternoon naps. In an effort to sneak a cigar that first day back in his office, Sir Wilfred finds himself intrigued by the case of Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power). Vole is a charming, too charming, man whom we don't quite trust. He has been charged with murdering a rich, silly woman...who coincidentally changed her will in Vole's favor a week before her death. Vole stands to become a very wealthy man. There is means, motive and opportunity, and for Sir Wilfred, there is a challenge. Vole swears he's innocent, but his story is not altogether plausible. His only hope, and a shaky one it is, is the testimony of his German wife, Christine (Marlene Dietrich). She has supplied an alibi, which cannot be verified, but at least she cannot be forced to testify against her husband. Then, when the marriage is found to be invalid, who should decide to become a witness for he prosecution? Sir Wilfred is mortified but even more determined to save his client.The case, full of startling twists, legal shenanigans, first-rate performances and vivid characters, ends with a typically Agatha Christie surprise. Some argue that Christie perhaps was weak as a writer, but peerless as a storyteller, able to construct mystery plot puzzles that consistently stumped her readers until the last chapter. With Billy Wilder directing and Wilder and Harry Kurnitz, an old pro, providing the screenplay, Christie once again gives a surprise twist that leaves us open-mouthed, yet smiling at her cleverness. Thanks to Wilder and Kurnitz, we also have a conclusion that involves Sir Wilfred and Nurse Plimsoll that is immensely satisfying. If only there had been a sequel.The four leads do marvelous jobs. In a way, the movie is about two relationships, not just one. There is the relationship between Vole and his wife. They met when Vole was a sergeant stationed in Germany right after WWII. He met Christine when she was earning money entertaining in a dive for soldiers. We see some of this in flashback. With Vole's opportunistic charm and Christine's cool manner, it's difficult to determine who, if either of them, is using whom, or to what degree love enters the picture. Christine's first entrance is memorable. Says Sir Wilfred to a group of fellows awaiting Mrs. Vole, ""Be prepared for hysterics and even a fainting spell. Better have smelling salts handy and a nip of brandy."" Then in walks Marlene Dietrich as Christine Vole, with perfect assurance. ""I do not think that will be necessary,"" she says to Sir Wilfred. ""I never faint because I am not sure that I will fall gracefully and I never use smelling salts because they puff up the eyes. I am Christine Vole.""In the second relationship, Sir Wilfred and Nurse Plimsoll provide the acerbic and mutually bullying comic relief for the movie. The two actors, however, married in real life, manage to develop a touching inter-dependence. It's not just a smile they give as at the end, but also a modest lump in the throat.And personally, I was delighted to see Henry Daniell in a substantial secondary role. He plays Mayhew, the solicitor who brings Vole to Sir Wilfred. Daniell could look like he was sneering with disdain even if he was just admiring the view. He played some wonderfully upper-class cads and villains in a lot of so-so movies. He also was a first-rate actor, who, given the chance, could also play serious, concerned men, the kind you wouldn't mind having for a friend. He does a fine job here.The movie, filmed in black and white, looks very good in the DVD transfer.

Slipman,"[8, 8]","Charles Laughton is utterly brilliant as acerbic, splashy and celebrated English barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts in Billy Wilder's terrific ""Witness for the Prosecution"".  The irascible Sir Wilfrid has just returned home after a two month convalescence following a heart attack.  He arrives attached at the hip with nurse Miss Plimsoll played by a chatty Elsa Lanchester. Sir Wilfrid has been prohibited from drinking, smoking and practicing law in any stressful high profile cases.Laughton is visited by a solicitor friend seeking advice in a case involving Tyrone Power playing sketchy playboy type, Leonard Vole.  Vole has been implicated in the bludgeoning death of an elderly and wealthy widow Emily Jane French.  The married Vole had been wooing the widow hoping for financial backing for his invention.  Initially Laughton's inclination is to follow doctor's orders and refer the case to his trusted associate played by John Williams.  After interviewing Power, he is intrigued convinced of his innocence and decides to take the case.  His contention that Power has no motive for the killing is dashed when he discovers that the widow has left him 80,000 pounds.Power's only alibi is the testimony of his German born actress wife Christine played by Marlene Dietrich, that he was home at the established time of the murder.  Laughton questions Dietrich and learns that her marriage to Power is illegal and that she is actually a bigamist, being already married,  Her cool demeanor and abrasive personality forces him to dismiss her as a potential witness for the defense.In the courtroom, compelling circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecutor, English character actor Torin Thatcher makes things look grim for Power.  Much to the surprise of Laughton and his associate Mr. Brogan-Moore, Dietrich is called as a witness for the prosecution.  She skewers Power by failing to corroborate his alibi, dooming him.Miraculously, later that evening, the night before the closing arguments, Laughton is tipped off to the presence of incriminating letters written by Dietrich which will exonerate Power and cast suspicion on her.

There is no way that would be tolerated, at least today.Otherwise, it's a pretty solid film with a good cast that includes two fascinating characters played by actors who know how to entertain: Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich.Laughton, who plays Power's defense attorney, grabs the spotlight in the story but Dietrich almost steals the movie in her role as Power's wife. Laughton's dialog is terrific throughout, bringing a number of laughs to this serious film. He's just a joy to watch. Dietrich is even more riveting but just doesn't have anywhere near the same amount of screen time as Laughton.Not to be overlooked is Elsa Lanchester, playing Laughton's nurse.

Allen,"[0, 0]","Witness For The Prosecution (1957) is wonderful due to skilled stage actors, especially Charles Laughton, allowed to ""do their thing.""It's a movie presentation of a stage play.Stage actors are wonderful, but different than most movie actors.Stage acting is different than movie acting, and oddly, worth seeing when presented in movie form.Stage acting as a big business has largely disappeared (2012) and isn't seen often in the present age because stage plays have almost disappeared and are only a memory supported by a great film like this, and that's a shame.Camera tricks, movie magic, light shows, special effects and pyrotechnics, virtuoso editing never contributed to good stage acting and good stage presentations.Witness For The Prosecution (1957) is good because writing and the acting are allowed to dominate the movie in a setting (mostly a British ""Old Bailey"" large courtroom) which is well designed and plausible, but which doesn't change, and certainly never becomes the star of the movie.The actors and the story carry the movie. The script allows actors to declaim at length, and with actors as good as most in Witness For The Prosecution (1957), that'a a treat.The only actor who doesn't carry his part of the movie is Tyrone Power (1914 - 1958), then only one year away from his early death from a heart attack at age 44, and obviously overweight and in bad physical health and without energy or power his part called for.He was used anyway because he was ""good box office"" in spite of his obvious bad health and need to avoid movie stardom pressures and challenges.Heartless Hollywood strikes again, as so often in movie history.He turned the lead role of ""Leonard Vole"" in the movie down at first, then accepted when he was offered $300,000 plus a percentage of the movie's profits. He is seen with his top suit coat button attached to hide his pot belly and protruding stomach, since a normal front middle button attachment wasn't possible.Every other actor in the movie shines, except Tyrone Power, and the others are so good, and the script is so good and allows great actors to perform without interruption, one wonders why the success formula wasn't repeated much or ever after Witness For The Prosecution (1957) was made.One answer may be that the times changed..... ""the theater"" (i.e. the world of dramatic stage plays performed by skilled actors) disappeared, sadly.The actors seen in The Witness For The Prosecution (1957) were mostly older actors trained before WWII in England at a time when ""the theater"" was still alive and well there, and actors were taught their trade with the expectation there would always be a place and need for good actor work on the stage.This expectation was never the case with the movies. Movies don't depend on good actors the way the stage always did, just as movies don't depend on good writing which isn't needed for ""good box office"" due in part to the low tastes of many younger moviegoers whose money supports the movie industry. The young audience can be served video game type light shows with no need for a logical, dramatic, or culturally meaningful script...sad but true.--------------------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.",5,"Witness For The Prosecution (1957) is wonderful due to skilled stage actors, especially Charles Laughton.",1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,3206,"['Witness', 'Prosecution', '1957', 'wonderful', 'due', 'skilled', 'stage', 'actors', 'especially', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'allowed', 'do', 'thing', 'movie', 'presentation', 'stage', 'play.Stage', 'actors', 'are', 'wonderful', 'different', 'most', 'movie', 'actors.Stage', 'acting', 'different', 'movie', 'acting', 'oddly', 'worth', 'seeing', 'when', 'presented', 'movie', 'form.Stage', 'acting', 'big', 'business', 'largely', 'disappeared', '2012', ""n't"", 'seen', 'often', 'present', 'age', 'stage', 'plays', 'have', 'almost', 'disappeared', 'are', 'only', 'memory', 'supported', 'great', 'film', 'shame.Camera', 'tricks', 'movie', 'magic', 'light', 'shows', 'special', 'effects', 'pyrotechnics', 'virtuoso', 'editing', 'never', 'contributed', 'good', 'stage', 'acting', 'good', 'stage', 'presentations.Witness', 'Prosecution', '1957', 'good', 'writing', 'acting', 'are', 'allowed', 'dominate', 'movie', 'setting', 'mostly', 'British', 'Old', 'Bailey', 'large', 'courtroom', 'well', 'designed', 'plausible', ""n't"", 'change', 'certainly', 'never', 'star', 'movie.The', 'actors', 'story', 'carry', 'movie', 'script', 'actors', 'declaim', 'length', 'actors', 'as', 'good', 'most', 'Witness', 'Prosecution', '1957', 'treat.The', 'only', 'actor', 'who', ""n't"", 'carry', 'part', 'movie', 'Tyrone', 'Power', '1914', '1958', 'then', 'only', 'one', 'year', 'away', 'early', 'death', 'heart', 'attack', 'age', '44', 'obviously', 'overweight', 'bad', 'physical', 'health', 'energy', 'power', 'part', 'called', 'for.He', 'was', 'used', 'anyway', 'was', 'good', 'box', 'office', 'spite', 'obvious', 'bad', 'health', 'need', 'avoid', 'movie', 'stardom', 'pressures', 'challenges.Heartless', 'Hollywood', 'strikes', 'again', 'so', 'often', 'movie', 'history.He', 'turned', 'lead', 'role', 'Leonard', 'Vole', 'movie', 'down', 'first', 'then', 'accepted', 'when', 'was', 'offered', '300,000', 'percentage', 'movie', 'profits', 'seen', 'top', 'suit', 'button', 'attached', 'hide', 'pot', 'belly', 'protruding', 'stomach', 'normal', 'front', 'middle', 'button', 'attachment', 'was', ""n't"", 'possible.Every', 'other', 'actor', 'movie', 'shines', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'others', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'script', 'so', 'good', 'great', 'actors', 'perform', 'interruption', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'success', 'formula', 'was', ""n't"", 'repeated', 'much', 'ever', 'Witness', 'Prosecution', '1957', 'was', 'made.One', 'answer', 'may', 'be', 'times', 'changed', '..', 'theater', 'i.e', 'world', 'dramatic', 'stage', 'plays', 'performed', 'skilled', 'actors', 'disappeared', 'sadly.The', 'actors', 'seen', 'Witness', 'Prosecution', '1957', 'were', 'mostly', 'older', 'actors', 'trained', 'WWII', 'England', 'time', 'when', 'theater', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'well', 'there', 'actors', 'were', 'taught', 'trade', 'expectation', 'there', 'would', 'always', 'be', 'place', 'need', 'good', 'actor', 'work', 'stage.This', 'expectation', 'was', 'never', 'case', 'movies', 'Movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'depend', 'good', 'actors', 'way', 'stage', 'always', 'did', 'just', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'depend', 'good', 'writing', ""n't"", 'needed', 'good', 'box', 'office', 'due', 'part', 'low', 'tastes', 'many', 'younger', 'moviegoers', 'money', 'movie', 'industry', 'young', 'audience', 'can', 'be', 'served', 'video', 'game', 'type', 'light', 'shows', 'need', 'logical', 'dramatic', 'culturally', 'meaningful', 'script', 'sad', 'true.', 'Written', 'Tex', 'Allen', 'SAG', 'Actor']",Witness for the Prosecution VHS

310954,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6302413435,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 0]","A labyrinth of deception is expected in an Agatha Christie mystery, and those unfamiliar with Billy Wilder's 1957 adaptation of the venerable writer's classic courtroom drama are in for a treat. Even if you already know how it all ends, there are still joys to be had from the star-studded cast and the master filmmaker's craftsmanship. Along with fellow screenwriters Larry Marcus and Harry Kurnitz, Wilder has imbued Christie's absorbing story with enough of his trademark humor to make the compelling film a genuine entertainment in the old Hollywood tradition. The plot centers on master barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts, who decides to take as a client Leonard Vole, an unemployed kitchen-gadget inventor who is charged with murder. Robarts is in ill health and must tolerate the constant pestering of Miss Plimsoll, a nurse assigned to make sure Robarts slows down and takes his medications. Through a trick he employs by having sunlight reflect on his monocle, Robarts believes Vole to be innocent of the charge of killing wealthy, lonely matron Mrs. French. Naturally, there is a lot of circumstantial evidence that points to Vole being the killer.Enter Vole's cold German wife Christine, a former wartime chanteuse several years older than her husband and now his only alibi the night of the murder. The first surprising twist in the story occurs when Christine ends up playing the title role and kick-starts a series of revelations that lead to its somewhat unexpected conclusion. As Robarts, Charles Laughton has the best movie role of the latter phase of his lengthy career, displaying the character's sharp wit and cunning deductive skills with aplomb. His real-life wife Elsa Lanchester plays Miss Plimsoll with her familiar dotty manner and sing-song dithering. In his last completed role, Tyrone Power capitalizes on his seemingly effortless charm to play Vole but unfortunately tends to overact during key moments. Marlene Dietrich is ideally cast as the morally ambiguous Christine, showing off her legs in a wartime flashback and playing quite against character in the train station scene. You may be amused by a voiceover during the end credits that asks viewers not to reveal the surprise ending. A long trailer featuring Laughton is the only extra that comes with the 2001 DVD.",5,Smartly Played Star Turns and Agatha Christie's Plot Twists Elevate Wilder's Witty Courtroom Drama,1220313600,"09 2, 2008",2008,2296,"['labyrinth', 'deception', 'expected', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'mystery', 'unfamiliar', 'Billy', 'Wilder', '1957', 'adaptation', 'venerable', 'writer', 'classic', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'are', 'treat', 'Even', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'are', 'still', 'be', 'had', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'master', 'filmmaker', 'craftsmanship', 'fellow', 'screenwriters', 'Larry', 'Marcus', 'Harry', 'Kurnitz', 'Wilder', 'imbued', 'Christie', 'absorbing', 'story', 'enough', 'trademark', 'humor', 'make', 'compelling', 'film', 'genuine', 'entertainment', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'tradition', 'plot', 'centers', 'master', 'barrister', 'Sir', 'Wilfrid', 'Robarts', 'who', 'take', 'client', 'Leonard', 'Vole', 'unemployed', 'kitchen-gadget', 'inventor', 'who', 'charged', 'murder', 'Robarts', 'ill', 'health', 'must', 'tolerate', 'constant', 'pestering', 'Miss', 'Plimsoll', 'nurse', 'assigned', 'make', 'sure', 'Robarts', 'down', 'medications', 'trick', 'having', 'sunlight', 'reflect', 'monocle', 'Robarts', 'Vole', 'be', 'innocent', 'charge', 'killing', 'wealthy', 'lonely', 'matron', 'Mrs.', 'French', 'Naturally', 'lot', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'points', 'Vole', 'being', 'killer.Enter', 'Vole', 'cold', 'German', 'wife', 'Christine', 'former', 'wartime', 'chanteuse', 'several', 'years', 'older', 'husband', 'now', 'only', 'night', 'murder', 'first', 'surprising', 'twist', 'story', 'when', 'Christine', 'up', 'playing', 'title', 'role', 'kick-starts', 'series', 'revelations', 'lead', 'somewhat', 'unexpected', 'conclusion', 'Robarts', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'best', 'movie', 'role', 'latter', 'phase', 'lengthy', 'career', 'displaying', 'character', 'sharp', 'wit', 'cunning', 'deductive', 'skills', 'aplomb', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'Miss', 'Plimsoll', 'familiar', 'dotty', 'manner', 'sing-song', 'dithering', 'last', 'completed', 'role', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'seemingly', 'effortless', 'charm', 'play', 'Vole', 'unfortunately', 'overact', 'key', 'moments', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'ideally', 'cast', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'Christine', 'showing', 'off', 'legs', 'wartime', 'flashback', 'playing', 'quite', 'character', 'train', 'station', 'scene', 'may', 'be', 'amused', 'voiceover', 'end', 'viewers', 'not', 'reveal', 'surprise', 'ending', 'long', 'trailer', 'featuring', 'Laughton', 'only', 'extra', '2001', 'DVD']",Witness for the Prosecution VHS

The way he counts on his wife.""- ""Yes, like a drowning man clutching at a razor blade.""Tyrone Power was 43 years old when he acted in WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION, a dynamic 1957 courtroom whodunit which proved to be his final completed film. Not too long after, Ty Power would suffer a fatal heart attack while shooting a scene with George Sanders for the upcoming sword & sandal drama SOLOMON AND SHEBA. But if one were looking to put a cap on a heck of a cinematic career, then WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION will do nicely, thanks ever much. Ty Power goes out on top.The high-powered cast doesn't let you down. We're treated to three powerhouse performances. WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION boasts Billy Wilder as its director and as screenplay co-writer, this screenplay, by the way, adapted from Agatha Christie's stage play. Charles Laughton is magnificent, his patented bombast put perfectly to use. He plays Sir Wilfrid Robarts, London's preeminent barrister but one who is also a convalescing cardiac patient. As such Sir Wilfrid is banned by his physician from undertaking criminal cases. But when a murder case is brought to his doorstep - something about a middle-aged widow whose head had been bashed in - Sir Wilfrid sees something likable in the accused, Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power), and so decides to defend him in the upcoming trial, his health be damned. He promptly steps into a viper's pit.Ty Power wasn't the first actor to be offered his role, except that other leadings stars like William Holden and Kirk Douglas were already neck deep shooting in other films. And who knows how Holden or Douglas would've interpreted the part of Vole. But they would've had to work hard to match Power's magnetic presence here. WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION would've been so much less had Power not been able to play his role so convincingly. If you assumed he was nothing beyond his swashbuckling roles, think it over. His Leonard Vole is equal parts shiftless and charismatic, a bit seedy but so ingratiating. When Sir Wilfrid makes up his mind to defend Vole, it's because he's persuaded of Vole's innocence, and Power had to really sell that quality.This is inarguably one of the greatest courtroom dramas in cinema. There are so many twists and turns here that even pretzels may get whiplash. At the end of the film, there's even a voiceover that urges the movie audience to keep mum about the shocking climax. The ageless Marlene Dietrich should've probably been nominated for an Oscar, but the film studio execs were so determined to keep the film's big reveals on the hush that she wasn't properly promoted. Still, Dietrich submits a riveting performance as the accused's icy and calculating German wife.Balancing the many taut moments are the comedic flourishes brought by Laughton and his real-life wife, Elsa Lanchester, who plays Sir Wilfrid's nagging personal nurse, Miss Plimsoll. It should be pointed out that their lighthearted interactions weren't drawn from Agatha Christie's original play, that they were instead written in by the screenplay writers. I thought that these scenes work remarkably well and went a ways in humanizing Sir Wilfrid. Sometimes, it could be a chore relating to the always mannered Charles Laughton. Did I mention how very good Laughton is in this one? It's a lot of fun watching him perform in the courthouse. When not in the courthouse, he tones down the theatrics, except that Charles Laughton is nothing if not always on. Even his subdued moments carry flash. This is one of his best roles, and one of his most sympathetic. In fact, no one sucks here.",5,"Wilder, Laughton, Dietrich, and Power rock an Agatha Christie joint",1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,3619,"['Touching', ""n't"", 'way', 'wife', 'Yes', 'drowning', 'man', 'clutching', 'razor', 'blade', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'was', '43', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'acted', 'WITNESS', 'THE', 'PROSECUTION', 'dynamic', '1957', 'courtroom', 'whodunit', 'proved', 'be', 'final', 'completed', 'film', 'Not', 'too', 'long', 'Ty', 'Power', 'would', 'suffer', 'fatal', 'heart', 'attack', 'shooting', 'scene', 'George', 'Sanders', 'upcoming', 'sword', 'sandal', 'drama', 'SOLOMON', 'AND', 'SHEBA', 'one', 'were', 'looking', 'put', 'cap', 'heck', 'cinematic', 'career', 'then', 'WITNESS', 'THE', 'PROSECUTION', 'will', 'do', 'nicely', 'thanks', 'ever', 'much', 'Ty', 'Power', 'out', 'top.The', 'high-powered', 'cast', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', ""'re"", 'treated', 'three', 'powerhouse', 'performances', 'WITNESS', 'THE', 'PROSECUTION', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'director', 'screenplay', 'co-writer', 'screenplay', 'way', 'adapted', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'stage', 'play', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'magnificent', 'patented', 'bombast', 'put', 'perfectly', 'use', 'Sir', 'Wilfrid', 'Robarts', 'London', 'preeminent', 'barrister', 'one', 'who', 'also', 'convalescing', 'cardiac', 'patient', 'such', 'Sir', 'Wilfrid', 'banned', 'physician', 'undertaking', 'criminal', 'cases', 'when', 'murder', 'case', 'brought', 'doorstep', 'something', 'middle-aged', 'widow', 'head', 'had', 'been', 'bashed', 'Sir', 'Wilfrid', 'something', 'likable', 'accused', 'Leonard', 'Vole', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'so', 'defend', 'upcoming', 'trial', 'health', 'be', 'damned', 'promptly', 'viper', 'pit.Ty', 'Power', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'actor', 'be', 'offered', 'role', 'other', 'leadings', 'stars', 'William', 'Holden', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'were', 'already', 'neck', 'deep', 'shooting', 'other', 'films', 'who', 'how', 'Holden', 'Douglas', 'would', ""'ve"", 'interpreted', 'part', 'Vole', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'work', 'hard', 'match', 'Power', 'magnetic', 'presence', 'here', 'WITNESS', 'THE', 'PROSECUTION', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'had', 'Power', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'play', 'role', 'so', 'convincingly', 'assumed', 'was', 'nothing', 'swashbuckling', 'roles', 'think', 'over', 'Leonard', 'Vole', 'equal', 'parts', 'shiftless', 'charismatic', 'bit', 'seedy', 'so', 'ingratiating', 'When', 'Sir', 'Wilfrid', 'up', 'mind', 'defend', 'Vole', 'persuaded', 'Vole', 'innocence', 'Power', 'had', 'really', 'sell', 'quality.This', 'inarguably', 'one', 'greatest', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'cinema', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'here', 'even', 'pretzels', 'may', 'get', 'whiplash', 'end', 'film', 'even', 'voiceover', 'movie', 'audience', 'keep', 'mum', 'shocking', 'climax', 'ageless', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'should', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'film', 'studio', 'execs', 'were', 'so', 'determined', 'keep', 'film', 'big', 'reveals', 'hush', 'was', ""n't"", 'properly', 'promoted', 'Still', 'Dietrich', 'riveting', 'performance', 'accused', 'icy', 'calculating', 'German', 'wife.Balancing', 'many', 'taut', 'moments', 'are', 'comedic', 'flourishes', 'brought', 'Laughton', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'who', 'Sir', 'Wilfrid', 'nagging', 'personal', 'nurse', 'Miss', 'Plimsoll', 'should', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'lighthearted', 'interactions', 'were', ""n't"", 'drawn', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'original', 'play', 'were', 'instead', 'written', 'screenplay', 'writers', 'thought', 'scenes', 'work', 'remarkably', 'well', 'went', 'ways', 'humanizing', 'Sir', 'Wilfrid', 'Sometimes', 'could', 'be', 'chore', 'relating', 'always', 'mannered', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'Did', 'mention', 'how', 'very', 'good', 'Laughton', 'one', 'lot', 'fun', 'watching', 'perform', 'courthouse', 'When', 'not', 'courthouse', 'down', 'theatrics', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'nothing', 'not', 'always', 'Even', 'subdued', 'moments', 'carry', 'flash', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'one', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'fact', 'one', 'here']",Witness for the Prosecution VHS

Which is better, the star-studded extravaganza that is Murder on the Orient Express, or the more taught and spare courtroom drama Witness for the Prosecution?Charles Laughton portrays an aging barrister in failing health who has been ordered by his doctor to cut back on his legal work, as well as his drinking and smoking. A solicitor comes to him with a potential client, an American played by Tyrone Power, who is accused of murdering his patroness, a wealthy English widow. Laughton must decline, doctor's orders you know. He takes his leave to ride upstairs on his new banister escalator, but spies in the solicitor's pocket a forbidden delicacy, a cigar. He descends, takes the cigar, and takes the case.Marlene Dietrich plays the wife of Tyrone Power's character, and is expected to testify on his behalf, but instead becomes the Witness for the Prosecution. The usual Agatha Christie twists and turns ensue, with blind alleys and revelations, all marvelously negotiated by the three stars. Power's claim of innocence is whipsawed between his brilliant lawyer and his duplicitous wife. And then a mysterious informant tells Laughton about secrets the wife is keeping, secrets that could mean life or death for the hapless accused.For an enjoyable evening of suspense it would be hard to beat the combination of Christie, Laughton, Power and Dietrich, all under the masterful direction of Billy Wilder.

310969,A19JYLHD94K94D,6302413435,Itamar Katz,"[7, 7]","I, myself, am not a fan of Agatha Christie's or of any of her followers; I rarely find the strength to keep up with all the clues and the various witnesses, lawyers, cross-examinations and objections which all lead up to the inevitable conclusion that, well, The Butler Did It. I can certainly understand the appeal in this kind of puzzle-movie; it just never appealed to me. To me the main problem with this kind of stories is that usually, more emphasis is put on the clues than on the characters - and so, when the real murderer is finally revealed, I say: ""well, how about that?"" - I simply don't care.But in every genre there are always some creations that transcend the genre. Witness for the Prosecution stands as a true masterpiece among the Whodunit murder mysteries, one that will be pure ecstasy to fans of the genre, but is also a fantastic creation on any level and in any standard. This one proves just my point, that a clever story with a lot of characters and a lot of clues and misguiding clues just isn't enough; Christie's play is masterful, of course, and the twist at the end is one of the great classic shockers of cinema, one that matches modern classics like The Usual Suspects and Memento, if not transcends them; but it took more than the story to make that ending work. The reason it all works so well is because the characters are so captivating. That is thanks to two elements - first, Billy Wilder's (Some Like It Hot, Sunset Blvd., The Seven Year Itch) masterful direction, and an ensemble of fantastic actors, all of whom bring their characters to life; Charles Laughton is beyond brilliant as the aging, ailing, wily solicitor, and Tyrone Power is electrifying and fascinating as his client. Most of all the diva Marlene Dietrich grants a truly show-stopping performance, and steals the show from the rest of the cast - proving just how great she really was.By far the greatest trial drama ever made, and one of the greatest murder mysteries, it took the combined talents of Christie, Wilder and the fantastic cast to create such amazing drama in the courtroom alone; Witness for the Prosecution is basically an ensemble piece that is no more than a theatre production, but Wilder uses the full powers that he has at his disposal as a film director - close-ups, music, cinematography, lighting - to their full potential; and thus once again it is proven that he is one of the most underrated directors in history.

Secondly, I also enjoy a good Agatha Christie mystery.  Since this film is a combination of both, it's hardly a surprise I enjoyed it so much.  Tyrone Power is accused of murdering an older woman he was involved with, and it's up to barrister and heart patient Charles Laughton to defend him.  Power's best hope for help is his wife, Marlene Dietrich, while Laughton is forever being babied by his nurse, Elsa Lanchester.  There are a series of surprise revelations that take the viewer on a winding road to the truth, and the trip is a lot of fun.  The performances are all excellent.  Laughton gets to ham it up, and he does so with relish and style, while Power is surprisingly impassioned and convincing.  Both Dietrich and Lanchester give their usual quality performances, and it's fun to see an older Una O'Connor as the dead woman's maid.  O'Connor was a very distinctive character actress that added a lot of humour to many a film.  There are some great lines in the film delivered by Laughton (evidence of director and co-writer Billy Wilder's hand), and when added to a terrific mystery, you have the makings of a good evening's entertainment.",5,Courtroom+Agatha Christie=Entertainment,995673600,"07 21, 2001",2001,1276,"['should', 'probably', 'make', 'few', 'things', 'clear', 'review', 'film', 'First', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'Secondly', 'also', 'enjoy', 'good', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'mystery', 'film', 'combination', 'hardly', 'surprise', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'accused', 'murdering', 'older', 'woman', 'was', 'involved', 'up', 'barrister', 'heart', 'patient', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'defend', 'Power', 'best', 'hope', 'help', 'wife', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'Laughton', 'forever', 'being', 'babied', 'nurse', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'are', 'series', 'surprise', 'revelations', 'take', 'viewer', 'winding', 'road', 'truth', 'trip', 'lot', 'fun', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'Laughton', 'ham', 'up', 'so', 'relish', 'style', 'Power', 'surprisingly', 'impassioned', 'convincing', 'Dietrich', 'Lanchester', 'give', 'usual', 'quality', 'performances', 'fun', 'see', 'older', 'Una', ""O'Connor"", 'dead', 'woman', 'maid', ""O'Connor"", 'was', 'very', 'distinctive', 'character', 'actress', 'added', 'lot', 'humour', 'many', 'film', 'are', 'great', 'lines', 'film', 'delivered', 'Laughton', 'evidence', 'director', 'co-writer', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'hand', 'when', 'added', 'terrific', 'mystery', 'have', 'makings', 'good', 'evening', 'entertainment']",Witness for the Prosecution VHS

And what creates home more than those films you saw during your formative years? My first Marx Brothers, my first time with Bogart, my first gigantic plot twist all clank around in my brain even now.  Sometimes, as with The Ipcress File, a return visit is massively disappointing. Sometimes though, a trip back is more exciting than imagined. Such a trip is Witness for the Prosecution, a film I loved when I first saw it, probably on TV way back when, and a film that looks even better today, especially in this lovely print.How could anyone dislike this film? While others here praise Power and Dietrich, I find their performances somewhat stilted and artificial. The plot conclusion muddies those waters, but they do not carry this tale. I'm happy to be in the minority, as they cannot sink this battleship. While Billy Wilder makes a wonderful captain, steering and choosing and selecting with a deftness not often seen, it is Charles Laughton, in what is certainly one of the finest performances on screen, who elevates this tale from the mere plot-driven supriseroo (like Ten Little Indians) to the realm of classics. He is extraordinary, moving from condescending, arrogant, sneering, scowling, and cranky, to overwhelmed with his own ignorance and staggered by how badly he is mistaken. Breathtaking in the smallest mannerisms and slightest vocal inflections. Elsa Lanchester, who often played the dithering wacko, is the perfect blend of subservience and skill. The supporting cast is all excellent. Familiar faces from a hundred films walk in, do a great job, and depart. But watching the aging Laughton, a man who no one could have seen as a box office draw, triumph, is a treat.

If one has the choice, go for the DVD.  It's widescreen, the transfer is flawless, and the sound is better.  It's funny, but I enjoyed the VHS version for years until I saw how much better it became on DVD.  I had to cut the contrast on my television by a couple of notches to get the right tone of grays, as happens often with these B/W films.This is indeed one of the best transfers of a Christie work to film.  Unlike so many of her books, there is no hidden clue or plot twist that leaves one feeling cheated at the end of the film.It's the cast, of course, that makes the movie for us.  Laughton and Lanchester take to their parts like they were born for them, filling their roles with obvious relish and enjoyment.  It reminds us how liberating roles can be when the actors aren't young and trying to appear sexy!Marlene Dietrich plays her part to near-perfection.  Considering she was 'way up in her fifties when this movie was made, she is effortless in her grace, if not also her beauty.  Who could play this part at that age in today's films?  No one I know.  Ms. Dietrich always knew her best wardrobe and lighting, and she uses it to great advantage here...., Tyrone Power has never seemed to fit so well with the rest of this cast.  I've always felt that he acted too 'young' for his part, for, like Ms. Dietrich, he is very obviously middle-aged, and not aging as well as she.  While still a handsome man, he seems a good ten years too old for his part.  He does his best, though, and certainly doesn't ruin the overall impression of the movie.As the movie requests, I won't go into the plot or the surprise ending, leaving that for the viewer.  I will say that the courtroom scene is one of the best ever made re British courts, as enjoyable as that in ""QB VII"", being so different from our American system.This is a movie to treasure and watch over again whenever one feels the need for a 'feel good' film with good guys and bad ones, too.

Otherwise, it is an entirely different kind of experience--a courtroom drama, a twisty mystery, an excursion into what is most British, and a vehicle for great performances by Charles Laughton, Elsa Lanchester and Marlene Dietrich. Laughton is especially wonderful as a barrister with a bad heart, who duels throughout with his scornful, but ultimately devoted, nurse who tries vainly to keep him away from cigars and bad food.  Laughton survives this bodily assault, because in the end, he is shown to be essentially a servant of truth.  The cynicism of American jurisprudence is absent here--Laughton's character does not give into easy rationalizations about his role(and to say more would be unfair to those who haven't seen it.) Laughton strives for nobility.  And yet, despite the wig and the courtliness, he is very alive in this role.

310981,A75MSQQ3LN86Z,6302413435,Josef Bush,"[23, 23]","Dietrich never had much good to say about this film; she didn't like the set, thought Power inadequate and was generally turned off by it.  I think probably she was disappointed that the public didn't respond with the praise she felt she deserved, in her ""transformation"" scene.  We can look back on it now and see that she did a good, professional job.  But then, that's what makes this courtroom whodunnit drama so fine: the high level of performance by all the actors involved.  You can count them all one by one: Agatha Christie for the story; Billy Wilder for at least half the screenplay; Charles Laughton in one of his best roles and supported by his wife the excellent comedienne Elsa Lanchester; the best English character actors in the business, and Dietrich in probably her least sympathetic -- and therefore most remarkable -- performance.  As to Tyrone Power? He played the part of an ex-RAF guy, drifting from job to job and mostly living off his wife; a sleaze-ball seller of novelty egg-beaters, door-to-door who preys on lonely women.  In other words, the kind of guy who could only get by on his looks.  Power had much more than his looks to get by on, and here, the rest is acting.  Marlene probably just had somebody else in mind for the role of Lawrence Vole.This play was a hit for a very long time for Patricia Jessel, in London, and one can only imagine the intrigue Dietrich must have resorted to to get the role for herself.  Billy Wilder's wife is reported to have called Dietrich ""a whore,"" (how many Hollywood wives must have said the same?)but in all probability it was only because both Marlene and Billy came out of Pre-War Berlin and Vienna and as expatriates spent a great deal of time talking intimately about the project, in German.  After von Sternberg, Dietrich considered herself not merely an actress and star, but a participant in the artistic creation of the enterprise.  Probably it was their artistic intimacy (and their understanding about sexuality) that produced A FOREIGN AFFAIR too.  But this film is remarkable in two telling ways; it is witty not just in dialogue, but in camera use, and most of all, in pace.  Unlike many English films of the period, the story is told with terrific speed.  A sense of urgency permeates the story.  The surface of WITNESS crackles with a dry, ironic electrical tension.

I've seen some criticism of Tyrone Power but I can't agree.  Far from wooden, he alternates between suave man-about-town and frantic defendant depending on the scene.  Marlene Dietrich is also very compelling as his wife although I'm not sure I see her appeal as a sex-symbol which she used to enjoy.  By far the best role, however, belongs to Charles Laughton as the defense attorney (or barrister) and he nails it beyond belief.  His character is a classic curmudgeon but he plays it with such charm and humor that he is one of my favorite characters of all time from any movie.The story moves along briskly and there are plenty of mood shifts as some scenes are very light and funny while others are quite tense.

(I'm assuming the Agatha Christie play on which the movie is based was equally witty.) This is one of those captivating movies that make you appreciate the OLD Hollywood, an incredible team effort that did the old studio system proud.The last time I saw this, I was conscious of how cleverly sex was conveyed in old movies. In the scene where Tyrone Power meets Marlene Dietrich, they are oozing sex out of every pore, but because this was 1957, it had to be slyly hinted at instead of blatant.  Call me old-fashioned, but I think it's better for the subtlety.Although Tyrone Power (a rather wooden leading man) got top billing in this, Dietrich and Laughton (as the almost-retired defense lawyer) get all the good scenes, especially in the courtroom. In our health-obsessed age, it's fun watching Laughton do end-runs around his fussy nurse (Lanchester) in order to keep himself supplied with cigars and brandy. They come to a meeting of minds at the film's end, but I'll say no more abou that. The tomfoolery makes a nice contrast with the stiffness of the English lawyers in their wigs.I wouldn't dream of giving away the ending of this, but will say it is one of the best twist (really, double twist) endings of any movie ever made, also providing that sense of moral rightness that makes fans of murder mysteries and courtroom dramas sigh with satisfaction.",5,Superb Mix of Comedy and Suspense,1172361600,"02 25, 2007",2007,1575,"['1957', 'classic', 'usually', 'billed', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'most', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'films', 'also', 'comedy', 'full', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'Una', ""O'Connor"", 'provide', 'ample', 'humor', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'play', 'movie', 'based', 'was', 'equally', 'witty', 'one', 'captivating', 'movies', 'make', 'appreciate', 'OLD', 'Hollywood', 'incredible', 'team', 'effort', 'did', 'old', 'studio', 'system', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'was', 'conscious', 'how', 'cleverly', 'sex', 'was', 'conveyed', 'old', 'movies', 'scene', 'where', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'meets', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'are', 'oozing', 'sex', 'pore', 'was', '1957', 'had', 'be', 'slyly', 'hinted', 'instead', 'blatant', 'Call', 'old-fashioned', 'think', 'better', 'subtlety.Although', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'rather', 'wooden', 'leading', 'man', 'got', 'top', 'billing', 'Dietrich', 'Laughton', 'almost-retired', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'get', 'good', 'scenes', 'especially', 'courtroom', 'health-obsessed', 'age', 'fun', 'watching', 'Laughton', 'do', 'end-runs', 'fussy', 'nurse', 'Lanchester', 'order', 'keep', 'supplied', 'cigars', 'brandy', 'come', 'meeting', 'minds', 'film', 'end', ""'ll"", 'say', 'no', 'more', 'abou', 'tomfoolery', 'nice', 'contrast', 'stiffness', 'English', 'lawyers', 'wigs.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'dream', 'giving', 'away', 'ending', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'best', 'twist', 'really', 'double', 'twist', 'endings', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'also', 'providing', 'sense', 'moral', 'rightness', 'fans', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'sigh', 'satisfaction']",Witness for the Prosecution VHS

The vanity implied  makes it a bit absurd, you see. Anyway, the extreme youth of Power's character isn't really the operative point; he's younger than the murder victim, and that's enough. The real firework displays come from Laughton and Dietrich. Both give Academy Award-calibre performances in their adversarial roles.

Charles Laughton portrays the huge hunk of a man, barrister Sir Wilfrid, who, as the film opens, is returning home from an extended stay in the hospital for a near fatal heart attack. He is accompanied by his eccentric nurse whose sole job is to keep him away from everything he craves-cigars, brandy, women and high stress criminal cases. Of course, he immediately becomes intrigued with the case of Leonard Vole (Power) who is accused of killing a wealthy widow. His curiosity gets the best of him when he meets Christine Helm/Vole (Dietrich), Leonard's wife and only alibi, and so he decides to take Leonard's case. The rest of this fast-paced film concentrates on the courtroom drama with it famous surprises and great acting and is spiced with some very funny scenes and lines.

As the plot opens, ""nice guy"" Tyrone Power stands accused of murdering a wealthy widow. Unemployed and shiftless, he reminded this reviewer of Ray Milland in ""Dial M for Murder"". TP was the last known person to see the demised alive, has a shaky alibi-and is in the lady's will for big bucks! TP turns in desperation to big shot London lawyer Charles Laughton. In fact, Scotland Yard busts him in CL's office! Most have already commented on the lively courtroom drama but this reviewer admired the out of court sparring too as Laughton and his colleagues prepare for trial. Just out of the hospital, CL is perfect as the curmudgeonly and crafty barrister, even if he does tear up most of his scenes. His tart banter with his nurse (Elsa Lanchester) is softened by the knowledge that she was his real life wife. There are at least 3 huge plot twists to WFP, leading this observer to write a concise review in the interests of not divulging the ending. That leads us to female lead Marlene Dietrich: She is central to those twists- watch her closely! MD played 30 movies from 1930-1965; was she ever better than here? Hollywood took notice of WFP: It was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Laughton) and Best Supporting Actress (Lanchester), though winning none. Dietrich was ignored by the Academy but nominated for Best Actress by the Golden Globes. How many times were husband and wife nominated together? WFP is filmed is beautiful black and white-a lost art-and features true economy of sets, perhaps reflecting its' stage origins. This review tried to maintain an aura of mystery about the ending; there is a good deal more suspense than implied here.

Their disinterest shows.  Most MGM DVD's have been mastered (and I use the term loosely) from second, third or fourth generation prints instead of original camera negatives.  Many are bare bones in the way of extra features and almost all of the newly released classic line of catalogue titles don't even come with a color insert that lists chapter breaks.  &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; can bear witness to all of the above.Basically, this is an overdone courtroom drama - think of an episode of &quot;Law and Order&quot; transported to a British locale and stretched to feature length running time and that's basically the idea behind this movie. Charles Laughton is a barrister defending Tyrone Power, who is accused of killing his employer one stormy night.  There's plenty of melodrama and some really bad acting by Marlene Dietrich in the second half as she tries to impersonate a cockney waif in order to throw Laughton off course.  The one salvation of the film is Laughton's performance - it's brilliant!As pure cinema, this movie would play as moderately entertaining if it weren't for the fact that MGM has once again given us the short end of the stick.  A non-anamorphic print, riddled with aliasing, edge enhancement and pixelization.  The gray scale is rendered properly (a small comfort)and the audio is amply provided for (another small comfort) but we basically get a forty year old print that's been run through the projector once too often and presented for us with no attempt to clean up the original camera negative before rushing things out to DVD.

""Witness for the Prosecution"" is one of the funniest and most fascinating stories I have watched. Leave it to Billy Wilder and Agatha Christie to concoct a story that'd keep viewers on the edges of their seats.Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton) is known as the 'champion of lost causes.' He's the barrister's barrister and the fox.  He's also just recovering from a heart attack. The old curmudgeon is also stuck with a nurse, Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lancaster), who continously talks babytalk to him.""Just roll up your mouth, you talk too much. If I'd known how much you talk I'd never have come out of my coma,"" he tells her--and worse.Doctors have ordered Sir Wilfrid to rest, stop smoking, drinking, and only try civil suits. When he hears about the case where gigolo Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) is accused of killing Emily Jane French a wealthy older woman, he cannot resist to try the case.Everything's going well til Christine Helm-Vole (Marlena Dietrich) takes the stand and unbeknowst to Sir Wilfred beforehand testifies for the prosecution.Can the old fox still get his client off?  This story has more twists than a pretzel factory. The dialog, particularly Sir Wilfrid's, is some of the best I have heard. The end literally had me up and out of my seat.My only reason for a half-star deduction is because the black and white rendering on the DVD is very dark and makes it occasionally difficult to view without doing some contrast adjustments.

311018,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,6302413435,RMurray847,"[4, 4]","Seriously one of the great courtroom dramas of all time.  A taut, unpredictable mystery...one of Agatha Christie's finest twists, and she was the master of the unguessable ending.  Accompanied by terrific characters (all colorful and over the top, but highly entertaining) played to the hilt by some truly fine actors, many of whom were reaching the ends of their serious careers (Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, Tyrone Power) but were also at the very top of their games.I won't trouble you with all the details of the plot.  It's a seemingly simple murder mystery / courtroom drama that just gets more and more complex as the layers of the plot are peeled away.  If you want a movie with deep, realistic characterizations...this is not it.  If you want vivid, larger-than-life people engaged in a series of high-stakes cat-and-mouse games, you'll be very satisfied.Yes, the movie is nearly 50 years old, but it has aged unbelievably well.  The direction is spot-on from the peerless Billy Wilder.  His filmmaking is so clean and unpretentious, and yet powerfully effective.  He knows when to use the closeup, when to pan back.  They are technically unremarkable...except it is so difficult to make a movie this unobtrusive in its artistry, that I admire Wilder for that ability.Charles Laughton, as the attorney hired to represent murder suspect Tyrone Power, has NEVER been better.  He might have gained more awards for his HENRY VIII and more lasting fame for HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME...but this character has it all.  Bombast, cynicism, a real heart, great intelligence and a desert-dry wit.  If his were the only memorable turn in the film, it would be enough to recommend it.But you've got to see the legendary Marlene Dietrich.  She's past her height as a sex-symbol, but instead we get a rich performance that musters all her hard-won lessons over the decades.  If anyone ever thought she was just a charismatic figure...they need to see this.  She has charisma to burn, true, but skill as  well.  Tyrone Power is a dashing scoundrel, who may or may not be a murderer, and he is well-suited to the role...he's a mix of tough guy and romantic lead.  Elsa Lancaster has a small role as Laughton's assistant, and she's simply a hoot.  Throughout the film are many other recognizable British character actors of the `40s and `50s.  It's a top-notch production from beginning to end.And the ending is a doozy as well.  When the final twist is revealed, we're left to marvel at Agatha Christie's skills.  As a youth, I read all her books (literally all) and I can say this:  Agatha Christie may not have had the best writing skills (serviceable but not exactly Nobel Prize material) but her ability to craft an amazing and yet credible plot twist was and is unsurpassed.  Much of her work has been imitated over the decades.  Many of her twists still show up on everything from Murder She Wrote to CSI.  But she consistently came up with great ending after great ending.  For nearly 90 novels, and countless short stories.  And WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION (based very closely on her stage play, which she based on a short story of hers) has one of her better twists.I can't recommend this movie highly enough!",5,The best film Christie...and a fabulous courtroom drama!,1128902400,"10 10, 2005",2005,3215,"['Seriously', 'one', 'great', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'time', 'taut', 'unpredictable', 'mystery', 'one', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'finest', 'twists', 'was', 'master', 'unguessable', 'ending', 'Accompanied', 'terrific', 'characters', 'colorful', 'top', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'played', 'hilt', 'truly', 'fine', 'actors', 'many', 'whom', 'were', 'reaching', 'ends', 'serious', 'careers', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'top', 'games.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'trouble', 'details', 'plot', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'murder', 'mystery', '/', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'just', 'more', 'more', 'complex', 'layers', 'plot', 'are', 'peeled', 'away', 'want', 'movie', 'deep', 'realistic', 'characterizations', 'not', 'want', 'vivid', 'larger-than-life', 'people', 'engaged', 'series', 'high-stakes', 'cat-and-mouse', 'games', ""'ll"", 'be', 'very', 'satisfied.Yes', 'movie', 'nearly', '50', 'years', 'old', 'aged', 'unbelievably', 'well', 'direction', 'spot-on', 'peerless', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'filmmaking', 'so', 'clean', 'unpretentious', 'yet', 'powerfully', 'effective', 'when', 'use', 'closeup', 'when', 'pan', 'back', 'are', 'technically', 'unremarkable', 'so', 'difficult', 'make', 'movie', 'unobtrusive', 'artistry', 'admire', 'Wilder', 'Laughton', 'attorney', 'hired', 'represent', 'murder', 'suspect', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'NEVER', 'been', 'better', 'might', 'have', 'gained', 'more', 'awards', 'HENRY', 'VIII', 'more', 'lasting', 'fame', 'HUNCHBACK', 'OF', 'NOTRE', 'DAME', 'character', 'Bombast', 'cynicism', 'real', 'heart', 'great', 'intelligence', 'desert-dry', 'wit', 'were', 'only', 'memorable', 'turn', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'recommend', 'it.But', ""'ve"", 'got', 'see', 'legendary', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'past', 'height', 'sex-symbol', 'instead', 'get', 'rich', 'performance', 'hard-won', 'lessons', 'decades', 'anyone', 'ever', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'charismatic', 'figure', 'need', 'see', 'charisma', 'burn', 'true', 'skill', 'as', 'well', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'dashing', 'scoundrel', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'murderer', 'well-suited', 'role', 'mix', 'tough', 'guy', 'romantic', 'lead', 'Elsa', 'Lancaster', 'small', 'role', 'Laughton', 'assistant', 'simply', 'hoot', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'recognizable', 'British', 'character', 'actors', '40s', '50s', 'top-notch', 'production', 'beginning', 'end.And', 'ending', 'doozy', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'final', 'twist', 'revealed', ""'re"", 'left', 'marvel', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'skills', 'youth', 'read', 'books', 'literally', 'can', 'say', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'best', 'writing', 'skills', 'serviceable', 'not', 'exactly', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'material', 'ability', 'craft', 'amazing', 'yet', 'credible', 'plot', 'twist', 'was', 'unsurpassed', 'Much', 'work', 'been', 'imitated', 'decades', 'Many', 'twists', 'still', 'show', 'up', 'everything', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'CSI', 'consistently', 'came', 'up', 'great', 'ending', 'great', 'ending', 'nearly', '90', 'novels', 'countless', 'short', 'stories', 'WITNESS', 'FOR', 'THE', 'PROSECUTION', 'based', 'very', 'closely', 'stage', 'play', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'hers', 'one', 'better', 'twists.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'highly', 'enough']",Witness for the Prosecution VHS
311019,A16QODENBJVUI1,6302413435,Robert Moore,"[77, 82]","Although this film is filled with a bevy of excellent actors and actresses, and although he did play the part of Gracchus in SPARTACUS a couple of years later, and an excellent supporting role in ADVISE AND CONSENT a couple of years after that, this is the last truly great performance in the career of perhaps the greatest character actor film has seen. Charles Laughton was in no sense a leading man: obsese, unattractive, unathletic, awkward. He nonetheless managed to put together an astonishing career. WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION was released in 1957, but until that moment, the 1950s had not been kind to Laughton, whose greatest success came in the 1930s and 1940s. He had directed the remarkable THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER in 1955, but his acting parts in the decade, apart from David Lean's HOBSON'S CHOICE, were for the most part undistinguished and not among the finest of his career. WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION is Laughton's glorious return and, because of declining health, last great role. If WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION had nothing else to recommend it, Laughton's performance would make it well, well worth seeing.Luckily, this film has far more than Laughton to recommend it. Ironically, it was also the last great role for Tyrone Power, for whom WITNESS was also a part of a comeback (he also excelled in THE SUN ALSO RISES). I have to say, for anyone who had seen Power in films in the 1940s, his physical appearance in 1957 is shocking. Much like Errol Flynn, he had lived a hard life, and it shows. He would die of a heartattack a year after this performance, and looks much older than 43 years old. Nonetheless, the remarkable thing about Power is that while not a particularly great actor during the heyday of his career, when he looks carried him from role to role, near the end of his life he grew considerably as an actor. WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION is one of his better performances, by far. Unlike Laughton and Power, both aging and in poor health, but similar to both in that the 1950s had up to that point not been one of her most active decades, Marlene Dietrich appears barely to have aged since the 1930s. The kinds of parts she was best suited for were far too subversive for the staid 1950s. Her natural cynicism and sexuality were far too threatening at that time even for the darkest of film noir. So, WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION was something of a comeback (or the continuation of a comeback in the case of Power) for the three principles. The cast was rounded out by some stellar characters actors, including the always amazing Una O'Connor, the frequently villanous Henry Daniell (though not in this one), and John Williams (who had played Audrey Hepburn's chaffeur father in Wilder's SABRINA, playing Laughton's law partner in this one).Unlike the three leads, Billy Wilder was not suffering from any kind of lull in his career when he made this film. He had, first as a screenwriter and then as a director, been marching from triumph to triumph for the previous twenty years, and would continue to do so for another ten years. The movie was untypical Wilder, however. Along with Preston Sturges, Wilder is arguably the greatest writer of comedy scripts in the history of film (he had cowriters, but their primary function was to correct his Germanicisms, to polish his rough English; Wilder supplied the ideas and action). In WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION, however, although adapting an Agatha Christie original, and adding a huge number of Wilderian touches, he largely is working from someone else's work. Wilder virtually always wrote completely original stories.A lot of people love the plot of this one, and especially the twists, but I have to say that I find this somewhat artificial, and some of the least appealing parts of the film. What I do delight in is the interplay between the various characters, the chemistry between the actors and actresses, the dozens of little touches and transitions that Wilder makes while working within the limitations of someone else's story.But most of all, this film is great because Charles Laughton was able to find one last, great role before his career came to an end.",5,The Last Extraordinary Performance by Charles Laughton,1030924800,"09 2, 2002",2002,4157,"['film', 'filled', 'bevy', 'excellent', 'actors', 'actresses', 'did', 'play', 'part', 'Gracchus', 'SPARTACUS', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'role', 'ADVISE', 'AND', 'CONSENT', 'couple', 'years', 'last', 'truly', 'great', 'performance', 'career', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'character', 'actor', 'film', 'seen', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'was', 'sense', 'leading', 'man', 'obsese', 'unattractive', 'unathletic', 'awkward', 'nonetheless', 'managed', 'put', 'together', 'astonishing', 'career', 'WITNESS', 'THE', 'PROSECUTION', 'was', 'released', '1957', 'moment', '1950s', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'kind', 'Laughton', 'greatest', 'success', 'came', '1930s', '1940s', 'had', 'directed', 'remarkable', 'THE', 'NIGHT', 'THE', 'HUNTER', '1955', 'acting', 'parts', 'decade', 'apart', 'David', 'Lean', 'HOBSON', 'CHOICE', 'were', 'most', 'part', 'undistinguished', 'not', 'finest', 'career', 'WITNESS', 'THE', 'PROSECUTION', 'Laughton', 'glorious', 'return', 'declining', 'health', 'last', 'great', 'role', 'WITNESS', 'FOR', 'THE', 'PROSECUTION', 'had', 'nothing', 'else', 'recommend', 'Laughton', 'performance', 'would', 'make', 'well', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing.Luckily', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'Laughton', 'recommend', 'Ironically', 'was', 'also', 'last', 'great', 'role', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'whom', 'WITNESS', 'was', 'also', 'part', 'comeback', 'also', 'excelled', 'THE', 'SUN', 'ALSO', 'RISES', 'have', 'say', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'Power', 'films', '1940s', 'physical', 'appearance', '1957', 'shocking', 'Much', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'had', 'lived', 'hard', 'life', 'would', 'die', 'heartattack', 'year', 'performance', 'much', 'older', '43', 'years', 'old', 'Nonetheless', 'remarkable', 'thing', 'Power', 'not', 'particularly', 'great', 'actor', 'heyday', 'career', 'when', 'carried', 'role', 'role', 'end', 'life', 'grew', 'considerably', 'actor', 'WITNESS', 'THE', 'PROSECUTION', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'far', 'Laughton', 'Power', 'aging', 'poor', 'health', 'similar', '1950s', 'had', 'up', 'point', 'not', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'active', 'decades', 'Marlene', 'Dietrich', 'barely', 'have', 'aged', '1930s', 'kinds', 'parts', 'was', 'best', 'suited', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'subversive', 'staid', '1950s', 'natural', 'cynicism', 'sexuality', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'threatening', 'time', 'even', 'darkest', 'film', 'noir', 'So', 'WITNESS', 'THE', 'PROSECUTION', 'was', 'something', 'comeback', 'continuation', 'comeback', 'case', 'Power', 'three', 'principles', 'cast', 'was', 'rounded', 'out', 'stellar', 'characters', 'actors', 'including', 'always', 'amazing', 'Una', ""O'Connor"", 'frequently', 'villanous', 'Henry', 'Daniell', 'not', 'one', 'John', 'Williams', 'who', 'had', 'played', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'chaffeur', 'father', 'Wilder', 'SABRINA', 'playing', 'Laughton', 'law', 'partner', 'one', 'three', 'leads', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'was', 'not', 'suffering', 'kind', 'lull', 'career', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'had', 'first', 'screenwriter', 'then', 'director', 'been', 'marching', 'triumph', 'triumph', 'previous', 'twenty', 'years', 'would', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'ten', 'years', 'movie', 'was', 'untypical', 'Wilder', 'however', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'Wilder', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'writer', 'comedy', 'scripts', 'history', 'film', 'had', 'cowriters', 'primary', 'function', 'was', 'correct', 'Germanicisms', 'polish', 'rough', 'English', 'Wilder', 'supplied', 'ideas', 'action', 'WITNESS', 'THE', 'PROSECUTION', 'however', 'adapting', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'original', 'adding', 'huge', 'number', 'Wilderian', 'touches', 'largely', 'working', 'someone', 'else', 'work', 'Wilder', 'virtually', 'always', 'wrote', 'completely', 'original', 'stories.A', 'lot', 'people', 'love', 'plot', 'one', 'especially', 'twists', 'have', 'say', 'find', 'somewhat', 'artificial', 'least', 'appealing', 'parts', 'film', 'What', 'do', 'delight', 'interplay', 'various', 'characters', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'actresses', 'dozens', 'little', 'touches', 'transitions', 'Wilder', 'working', 'limitations', 'someone', 'else', 'story.But', 'most', 'film', 'great', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'was', 'able', 'find', 'one', 'last', 'great', 'role', 'career', 'came', 'end']",Witness for the Prosecution VHS

""Pop Culture Addict""","[4, 5]","Leonard Vole: But this is England, where I thought you never arrest, let alone convict, people for crimes they have not committed.Sir Wilfrid: We try not to make a habit of it.When the name ""Billy Wilder"" is mentioned, most people immediately think of ""Sunset Blvd."" (1950), ""Some Like It Hot"" (1959), or ""The Apartment"" (1960). However, ""Witness for the Prosecution"" should be mentioned in the same breath. It is one of the hidden gems of cinema that not many people know of, but is beloved by those that do. Never has a courtroom drama been so entertaining, clever, and fun at the same time. You will be guessing throughout the film thanks to its twists and turns and be giddily amused when the facts are all finally set straight.The story opens with Sir Wilfrid (Charles Laughton) returning to work after recovering from health problems. The cranky barrister is eager to resume his legal duties despite warnings to take it easy from his personal nurse. He gets more excitement than he bargained for when he is referred a client named Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) - a man who is about to be arrested for murdering a wealthy widow. Is Vole innocent as he claims? The surrounding circumstances are suspicious: the widow had recently changed her will, leaving all of her money to Vole, and Vole's only alibi for the night in question is his wife. The police believe they have their man but Sir Wilfrid thinks otherwise and takes the case. As he pieces the facts together, Sir Wilfrid senses something is not right. He immediately figures out that Vole's wife, Christine (Marlene Dietrich), is playing a mysterious game of her own. But how exactly does she fit into the puzzle?Laughton as Sir Wilfrid is brilliant as the hardheaded barrister who stubbornly refuses to be stumped by the mystery at hand. Power also turns in a quality performance as the accused. His performance perfectly balances his character's charm and sliminess so that you're not quite sure whether he is guilty or not until the very end. Yet, the person who steals the show is the mesmerizing Dietrich. She manages to maintain the same level of screen presence as Laughton and proves to be a most adequate foil for him. The final scenes where she and Laughton put everything into perspective after the trial concludes are riveting. Both performers are at the top of their game in this film.

311029,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,6302413435,Themis-Athena,"[13, 15]","""No more murder cases,"" is the doctor's strict prohibition upon reluctantly releasing renowned barrister and recent heart attack survivor Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton) from hospital. (Although even the word ""release"" seems to be a matter of some dispute here, because according to Sir Wilfrid's nurse Miss Plimsoll [Elsa Lanchester], he was ""expelled for conduct unbecoming a cardiac patient.""  But let's leave that aside for now.)  And following the doctor's orders, Sir Wilfrid's staff have lined up an array of civil cases: a divorce, a tax appeal, and a marine insurance claim - surely those will satisfy their hard-to-please employer's demands?Err ... not likely.So, try as he might to be a good patient, Sir Wilfrid needs only little encouragement to accept the case of handsome drifter and small-time inventor Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power), accused of murdering his rich benefactress Emily French (Norma Varden).  Of course, the very circumstances that most disturb the famous barrister's colleagues Mayhew and Brogan-Moore (Henry Daniell and John Williams) - Mrs. French's infatuation with Vole, his visit to her on the night of the murder, the lack of an alternative suspect and his inheritance under her new will - just make the matter more interesting in Sir Wilfrid's eyes.  Most problematic, however, is Vole's alibi, which depends entirely on the testimony of his German wife Christine (Marlene Dietrich), an actress he had met when stationed with the RAF in WWII-ravaged Hamburg.  Troubling, insofar, isn't only that Christine is her husband's sole alibi witness and that - Sir Wilfrid explains - a devoted wife's testimony doesn't carry much weight anyway.  The real problem is that Christine isn't the loving, desperate wife one might expect: far from that, she is cool, calculating and surprisingly self-controlled; so much so that, worried because he cannot figure out her game, Sir Wilfrid decides not let her testify at all, rather than risk damaging his case.  That, however, seems to have been one of his illustrious career's few major miscalculations - because now he and his client suddenly have to face Christine as a witness for the prosecution.  And her testimony on the stand is only one of several surprises she has in store.""Witness for the Prosecution"" is based on a concept Agatha Christie first realized as a four-person short story (published in the 1933 collection ""The Hound of Death"") and subsequently adapted into what she herself would later call her best play, which opened in London in 1953 and in 1954 on Broadway, where it won the N.Y. Drama Critics' Circle citation as Best Foreign Play.  Throughout the adaptations the storyline was fleshed out more and more, the focus shifted from the work of solicitor Mayherne (whose name changed to Mayhew) to that of QC Sir Wilfrid Robarts, and the screenplay ingeniously added Miss Plimsoll's character, utilizing the proven on-screen chemistry of real-life spouses Laughton and Lanchester, for whom this was an astonishing eleventh collaboration, and whose banter bristles with director/co-screenwriter Billy Wilder's dry wit and the fireworks of the couple's pricelessly deadpan delivery, timing and genuine joy in performing together.Perhaps most importantly, the story's ending changed: not entirely, but enough to give it a different and, albeit very dramatic, less cynical slant than the short story's original conclusion. - To those of us who have grown up with Christie's works, those of her idol Conan Doyle and on a steady diet of Perry Mason, Rumpole of the Bailey and the many subsequent other fictional attorneys, the plot twists of ""Witness for the Prosecution"" (including its ending) may not come as a major surprise.  At the moment of the movie's release, however, the ending was a much-guarded secret; viewers were encouraged not to reveal it both in the movie's trailer and at the beginning of the film itself; and even the Royal Family was sworn to silence before a private showing.  Similarly, features such as the skillful, methodical unveiling of a seemingly upstanding, disinterested witness's hidden bias in cross-examination have long become standard fare in both real and fictional courtrooms, and any mystery fan worth their salt has heard more than one celluloid attorney yell at a cornered witness: ""Were you lying then or are you lying now?""  (Not recommended in real-life trial practice, incidentally.)  Yet, in these and other respects it was ""Witness for the Prosecution"" which laid the groundwork for many a courtroom drama to come; and herein lies much of its ongoing importance.Moreover, this is simply an outstandingly-acted film; not only by Laughton, Lanchester and a perfectly-cast Marlene Dietrich but by every single actor, also including Torin Thatcher (prosecutor Mr. Myers), Francis Compton (the presiding Judge) and, most noteably, Una O'Connor (Mrs. French's disgruntled housekeeper).  This is true even if Tyrone Power's emotional outbursts in court may be bewildering to today's viewers - and even if one wonders why an American-born star was acceptable for an Englishman's role without even having to bother trying to put on an English accent in the first place, whereas Dietrich and other non-native English speakers of the period, like Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman, were routinely cast as foreigners.  (Yes, yes, I know.  Redford and ""Out of Africa"" come to mind more recently, too, but that's a can of worms I won't open here.)""Witness for the Prosecution"" won a Golden Globe for Elsa Lanchester, but unfortunately none of its six Oscar nominations (which undeservedly didn't even include Marlene Dietrich), taking second seat to the year's big winner ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" in the Best Picture, Best Director (David Lean), Best Actor (Alec Guinness) and Best Editing categories, and to ""Sayonara"" for Best Supporting Acress (Miyoshi Umeki) and Best Sound.  No matter: with the noirish note resulting from its use of multiple levels of ambiguity - in noticeable contrast to Christie's Poirot and Miss Marple mysteries - it fits seamlessly next to such Billy Wilder masterpieces as ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""Double Indemnity;"" and it has long since become a true courtroom classic.Also recommended:The Witness for the Prosecution (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)Stage FrightThe Blue AngelMarlene Dietrich - The Glamour Collection (Morocco/ Blonde Venus/ The Devil Is a Woman/ Flame of New Orleans/ Golden Earrings)The Big Clock (Universal Noir Collection)",5,"""It's not the jury's judgment that worries me.

I bought it because of Leonard Maltin's fawning review, but found it to be stagey, even for a movie based on a play, and the characterizations (Dietrich's the exception) mightily ham-fisted.  Every scene with Dietrich is great, but she's really not in the movie much, leaving us with unfunny, in fact embarrassing, humor relief from Elsa Lanchester.  If you liked the corny humor of such duos as the two jokers in &quot;Stalag 17&quot; you won't mind her, but she didn't make me laugh even once.  In addition, the courtroom scenes are laughable as far as realism goes, which I can occaisonally handle, but this film went overboard.  Laughton's character should amaze us with his courtroom abilities, but instead Wilder just wrote a smattering of flowery lines for him to spout and allows him to steam through the trial nearly unopposed by the apparently incompetent prosecutor.  Perry Mason's arch-nemesis Burger had more luck than this guy.

311035,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,6302413435,William Hare,"[1, 2]","Billy Wilder had a well trained eye for a story.  The director co-adapted with Harry Kurnitz the successful stage drama ""Witness for the Prosecution"" by Agatha Christie to the screen with brilliant results, keeping audience members wondering to fadeout.  Recognizing he had a spellbinder, director Wilder inserted a message in the closing credits requesting that audience members not divulge the film's ending.Charles Laughton gives perhaps his finest film performance along with the highly saluted ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" as a garrulous British barrister who, after a near fatal heart attack, returns to work with the injunction to take things easy.  He quickly defies the ardent medical request by becoming involved in the murder trial of Tyrone Power, an American living in London who is accused of murdering wealthy heiress Norma Varden for her money.  He also spurns the efforts of faithful nurse Elsa Lanchester, Laughton's wife in real life, to take daily naps and refrain from drinking.  He puts brandy into a thermos jug purportedly containing hot chocolate.While Laughton skillfully employs his bag of courtroom tricks in an effort to secure a not guilty verdict for Power, he experiences nagging concerns that there is something eluding him, that he does not see the case in totality and has failed to find a missing ingredient which would clarify everything.  His cross examination skills are brutally trained on Marlene Dietrich, who announces that her presumed marriage to Power is not legal and she will serve as a witness for the prosecution.  As the dramatic action see saws audience members wonder just who is the film's culprit.  Is it Power or Dietrich?  Is the skilled conniver one or the other?  Just who has been victimized in this complex relationship?The swirling tide pool of emotional duplicity represents Wilder in his familiar orbit as master cynic, the same creative mind who stirred us up while watching ""Double Indemnity"", ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""The Lost Weekend"" and ""The Apartment"".
