Once to see the movie and the second time to see how it plays after you know the secret.,3,This movie was different,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,277,"['movie', 'had', 'different', 'twist', 'was', 'thinking', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'scenes', 'watching', 'movie', 'movie', 'think', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'twice', 'Once', 'see', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'see', 'how', 'know', 'secret']",Everything You Want

955732,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000C8STWG,Grady Harp,"[21, 21]","It is becoming more the rule than the exception that movies made for television are the equal if not better than many of the works made for the theaters.  Such is the case for this little bit of fluff of a movie - EVERYTHING YOU WANT.  Based on a play by Natalie Prado and adapted successfully for the screen by Steven A. Lee and Kevin Lawrence King, this film is lightweight but carries itself with style and fun by director Ryan Little and makes for an entertaining diversion of a film that is not about the heavier issues with which most films today are dealing.Abigail Morrison (a charming Shiri Appleby) grew up with absentee parents and spent her idle hours drawing and creating an imaginary friend Sy (Orlando Seale) to care for her loneliness.  Unfortunately she has carried Sy into her adult life, preventing her from dating real human beings.  As an art student she paints her imaginary boyfriend who is always there for her and makes her mistrustful of real guys who are bound to desert her...!  Abby meets a cocky young student Quinn (Nick Zano) faking his interest in art to get easy college credits.  There is a mutual attraction that takes some time to develop: Abby talks about her boyfriend Sy to shield her vulnerability.  Abby's friend Jessica (Alexandra Holden) is aware of Abby's imaginary Sy and attempts to get her to date real men.  But Jessica is not without her problems - maintaining employment at Borders Bookstore being one of them - and through a series of accidental encounters, Quinn steps in to help Jessica keep her job on the promise that Abby will coach him in art.  The obvious happens and Quinn's growth as a person mirrors Abby's ability to forego her need to hide behind Sy and the two become a couple.The young cast is attractive and for the most part acts well.  There are some strange subplots that don't add much to the storyline but at least introduce some different offbeat characters.  A deep movie this is not, but for an evening of light entertainment, this little film glimmers.

While it was not devoid of profanity it was kept to a minimum and  there was not one F**K in the entire movie but it still managed to be fun.  There was not one car crash, explosion, or needless property destruction but it still kept my interest.  While the characters were not deep and the roommate was totally unrealistic -- as were the parents -- it was all in good fun.  The only really negative thing I have to say about the movie was the thundering sound track which I felt was unnecessary and distracted more than contributed to the film.

955737,A1K94LXX833JTT,B000C8STWG,Sanpete,"[1, 1]","This little charmer is a by-the-numbers romantic comedy, complete with wacky sidekicks.  A budding artist girl meets an art-challenged boy in a college art appreciation class.  The girl already has another boy, seemingly perfect, but he isn't what he seems (the twist).  The leads are attractively played, the supporting cast characterful, if occasionally a bit over-the-top.  Better production values than expected for a made-for-TV movie, set mainly in college, a Border's Bookstore, various art venues, and a few living spaces, with nothing stronger than a swear word, a little beer, and a kiss.
