BUT, if you want to see Sonny Chiba as a ONE MAN ARMY with great and long fighting scenes as in Soul of Chiba, Street Fighter, Executioner and Karate Warriors then this one is NOT for you!The fighting scenes in this movie were good but not spectacular and they were a little short. At least, the acting and the story were much better. This is the kind of movie that Sonny Chiba made so he could show the audience a more serious version of himself and not a ONE MAN ARMY macho man with cheesy stories.Adios.",3,Good but not superb as Street Fighter or Karate Warriors.,1283040000,"08 29, 2010",2010,612,"['are', 'looking', 'good', 'action-packed', 'karate', 'film', 'set', 'past', 'then', 'one', 'BUT', 'want', 'see', 'Sonny', 'Chiba', 'ONE', 'MAN', 'ARMY', 'great', 'long', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'Soul', 'Chiba', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'Executioner', 'Karate', 'Warriors', 'then', 'one', 'NOT', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'movie', 'were', 'good', 'not', 'spectacular', 'were', 'little', 'short', 'least', 'acting', 'story', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'kind', 'movie', 'Sonny', 'Chiba', 'made', 'so', 'could', 'show', 'audience', 'more', 'serious', 'version', 'not', 'ONE', 'MAN', 'ARMY', 'macho', 'man', 'cheesy', 'stories.Adios']",Killing Machine
822231,A2KUPHNY30CRYG,B00023B1GM,Jusuf Hariman,"[3, 4]","Shorinji Kenpo is an extrapolation of what in Chinese is call Shao Lin School. It is very brave indeed for Doshin Sho to establish a dojo on Shao Lin after the war when many people in Japan still hated the Chinese. In any event, I am a fan of Sonny Chiba. As a senior instructor of a Kung Fu school and a black belt in Ju Jit Su, I can appreciate Sonny Chiba's fighting prowess. I think his martial arts sequences are excellent and realistic. There are some memorable scenes in this movie such as: (1). When Mr Chiba as a child was hit many times by his mother for a crime he didn't commit. Later, in front of her grave he said: ""Mother, you taught me how to endure but I choose to fight using my own strength; (2). When Mr Chiba saved Kiku for the second time, we can see from the expression in her face how grateful she was; (3). When one of his students lost his arm in a fight and wallowed in self pity, Mr Chiba tried to instill in him a sense of self-confidence by provoking him to attack him (Mr Chiba); (4). When Mr Chiba was thrown by an advanced Judo practitioner, in the air he managed to hit his opponent. This is a feat I have never seen; (5). When Mr Chiba cannot save Kiku, he realised that love and power should be conjoined together. He made appropriate changes in his school's motto. There are many other entertaining scenes but, the above should whet your appetite. This movie has very great entertainment value for martial arts aficionados.

Just as hard hitting emotionally as a lot of good american post war movies, BUT WITH KARATE.  I have to admit that I really am not a huge fan of Sonny Chiba.  But then again, I don't really like the street fighter movies.  I grew up on that stupid iron eagle movie.  i like him more in movies like shogun's assasin, shogun's ninja, kill bill, and storm rider's but this movie is more of the ""street fighter"" style and is in my personal opinion, BY FAR SONNY CHIBA's SINGLE BEST PERFORMANCE.  Sonny Chiba, the greatest anti hero ever is truly a killing machine in this one.So basically every time  you here a woman crying or someone is in trouble, SONNY CHIBA WILL START KILLING PEOPLE.  Oh man was he awesome.  He is not fighting  some fat karate guy like he did in street fighter but he is playing a characeter named Doshin So.  He was trained in Shaolin and eventually founded the style known today as Shorinji Kenpo.  And Kenpo is beign used to just detroy people in thsi movie!  He plays a renegade who after the war just gets pissed off at evreything wrong in the world and DOES SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!!!  He doesn;t give up, just keeps noticign things that are wrong with his country becasue of the war and blows up.  He is told to lay low, but oh no.  He keeps teaching at his school and a young girl who he saved twice learns from him.  So the local thugs know that Chiba is a badass and go to his school to offer him and his students money to take care of some criminal business they need done to capitilize on the post war depression, uh-oh.  You just asked that question to the wrong guy.  He declines of course but he goes to stop them and brings his students, of course.  One of his students gets killed and uh-oh again.  Yeah, some more limbs by the tens get broken and some  are lost forever:)Overall this movie has a few big flaws, but with how low of a budget they had, it was truly an epic for it's time.Perfectly letterboxed picture, 5.1 sound is pretty good, and picture is surprisingly VERY good.  Subtitles are also VERY good.Also some trailers including another one of my favorite chiba flicks-G.I. SAMURAI.I first saw this on the brentwood 10 pack-""Tough Guys of Kung Fu"" and that is actually a pretty good buy.  Full screened but probably best pictuer quality in the whole set.  Still pretty bad though.  I would only suggest the good version if you have the money and really enjoy this flick, casue i know I liked it enough that I had to egt teh other version.  Well worth it!

822234,A2MJ74DXA8TF80,B00023B1GM,Thomas Miller,"[1, 3]","I'm not a die-hard fan of Sonny Chiba movies, so it's not like I was disappointed with this particular film by him. It's just that the description for this movie hyped it up quite a bit but when I watched it, I thought maybe I was watching a different movie.The transfer on DVD is good. The picture is clean and the sound is good. So as far as quality of the DVD goes... it's great.The movie itself wasn't all it was cracked up to be.Let me break down the description with my opinions:>Sonny Chiba stars as Doshin So (actually it's ""Soh"", but whatever), a martial arts master who returns from the second World War after serving as an undercover spy.&lt;This is true, although barely dealt with except for a few brief minutes in the beginning of the film. He's discovered, gets into a fight and kicks everyone's butts all around. Then that's all there is about that.>Upon his return, he finds that his family's land has been stolen.&lt;Ummm... I must have missed this, because I don't remember them even talking about or dealing with this as part of the story.>Doshin must also take back the town from a group of black marketers and to rebuild his life.&lt;He fights some black marketers, but ""to rebuild his life""? Not quite. It was just a convenient fight scene.>He also helps a group of war orphans to get back on their feet including a young girl forced into prostitution.&lt;Again... true somewhat. He does help them, for like all of 7 or 8 minutes. Then he has to leave them because he has to leave town. So they are on their own and leaves you wondering what is to become of them with him gone.>In typical Chiba fashion, it's time to make someone pay!&lt;I don't know who he was trying trying to ""make pay"", but there seemed to be a lot of fight scenes but no real consistent enemy that he had to fight against.This story was kind of all over the place. I don't really think they had an actual plot, just a bunch of ideas for fight scenes and decided to film them together and try to make a buck.And as for the fight scenes, they are ""okay"". There really isn't a lot of amazing action and most of them are over with pretty quickly.I like some cheesy kung-fu movies, so it's not like I expected a lot out of this but this movie left me disappointed. I expected more from it (a coherent story, fantastic fight scenes) and was left with a mediocre ""B-"" movie instead.I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you are a Sonny Chiba fan and want to complete your collection. If that's the case, then this DVD has a great picture and sound.Otherwise this movie is kind of a let down.",2,"This movie is just ""okay""",1340064000,"06 19, 2012",2012,2579,"[""'m"", 'not', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'Sonny', 'Chiba', 'movies', 'not', 'was', 'disappointed', 'particular', 'film', 'just', 'description', 'movie', 'hyped', 'up', 'quite', 'bit', 'when', 'watched', 'thought', 'maybe', 'was', 'watching', 'different', 'movie.The', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'good', 'picture', 'clean', 'sound', 'good', 'So', 'as', 'far', 'quality', 'DVD', 'great.The', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'cracked', 'up', 'be.Let', 'break', 'down', 'description', 'opinions', '>', 'Sonny', 'Chiba', 'Doshin', 'So', 'actually', 'Soh', 'martial', 'arts', 'master', 'who', 'second', 'World', 'War', 'serving', 'undercover', 'spy.', 'lt', 'true', 'barely', 'dealt', 'few', 'brief', 'minutes', 'beginning', 'film', 'discovered', 'fight', 'everyone', 'butts', 'around', 'Then', 'that.', '>', 'return', 'family', 'land', 'been', 'stolen.', 'lt', 'Ummm', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'even', 'talking', 'dealing', 'part', 'story.', '>', 'Doshin', 'must', 'also', 'take', 'back', 'town', 'group', 'black', 'marketers', 'rebuild', 'life.', 'lt', 'black', 'marketers', 'rebuild', 'life', 'Not', 'quite', 'was', 'just', 'convenient', 'fight', 'scene.', '>', 'also', 'group', 'war', 'orphans', 'get', 'back', 'feet', 'including', 'young', 'girl', 'forced', 'prostitution.', 'lt', 'Again', 'true', 'somewhat', 'help', '7', '8', 'minutes', 'Then', 'leave', 'leave', 'town', 'are', 'own', 'wondering', 'what', 'become', 'gone.', '>', 'typical', 'Chiba', 'fashion', 'time', 'make', 'someone', 'pay', 'lt', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'trying', 'make', 'pay', 'there', 'seemed', 'be', 'lot', 'fight', 'scenes', 'real', 'consistent', 'enemy', 'had', 'fight', 'against.This', 'story', 'was', 'kind', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'had', 'actual', 'plot', 'just', 'bunch', 'ideas', 'fight', 'scenes', 'decided', 'film', 'together', 'try', 'make', 'buck.And', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'okay', 'really', ""n't"", 'lot', 'amazing', 'action', 'most', 'are', 'pretty', 'quickly.I', 'cheesy', 'kung-fu', 'movies', 'not', 'expected', 'lot', 'movie', 'left', 'disappointed', 'expected', 'more', 'coherent', 'story', 'fantastic', 'fight', 'scenes', 'was', 'left', 'mediocre', 'B-', 'movie', 'instead.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'buying', 'are', 'Sonny', 'Chiba', 'fan', 'want', 'complete', 'collection', 'case', 'then', 'DVD', 'great', 'picture', 'sound.Otherwise', 'movie', 'kind', 'let', 'down']",Killing Machine
