She spends the next few weeks alone, even while in the company of others.  She is not a misanthrope but she is unable to relate to those around her and her emotional vulnerability makes her very appealing.  The viewer will root for her.After a series of social disappointments,caused by her strongly held but eccentric views about life, from vegetarianism to men, she nears the end of her vacation.  Rejecting the promiscuity of a young Swedish acquaintance she meets on a beach Delphine holds out for her idea (ideal) of love. The film ends on a promising note as she watches the last green ray of the sun in Bayonne (Normandy,  New Jersey) with a young man she meets at the Biarritz train ststion.It is true as another reviewer mentioned that this film is greatly improvised. The problem is that it is not improvised very well and the fact that it is a film poorly transferred to a DVD format gives it an amatuerish feel. This is not in the same league with ""My Night at Maud's"" or ""Chloe in the Afternoon"".

And it's one of his best movies. Anyway, how not to be amazed by the global quality of his  production during more than 40 years ? With Eric Rohmer, you can really say  that this director is leaving an artistic work to the posterity like  Dickens or Picasso.SUMMER is a comedy ; not a comedy in the Disneyish  sense of the word but rather a comedy reminding the pieces of the romantic  French theatre of the XIXth century. One doesn't laugh during the vision of  SUMMER, one smiles.Delphine, played by the Rohmerian Marie Rivi&egrave;re, is  desperate. Two weeks before her summer holiday, her best friend, Catherine,  has found a new boy-friend and plans to spend the summer in his arms rather  than in the company of Delphine, even if it means adios to a trip into the  greek islands. What to do in Paris, alone, in august ? For a girl like  Delphine, a secretary dreaming all year long of her next holiday, it's a  drama. So we follow, day after day, her quest for happiness. At this point,  the comedy becomes tragedy as we find out that Delphine is the archetype of  the solitary ; refusing the occasions to make new acquaintances, developing  her differences to the extreme. You have to watch this scene involving a  vegetarian Delphine trying to explain to her guests, average French  steak-eaters, why it is not fair to eat meat !Marie Rivi&egrave;re is  outstanding in the role of Delphine and would have deserved an  international award for her interpretation. The DVD in itself is deceiving  as always with WinStar (ex-Fox Lorber).

187672,A106016KSI0YQ,1572525436,Jay Dickson,"[0, 0]","The difficulty of vacations is sometimes knowing where to go so that you'll be happy. In this 1986 comedy, Delphine (Marie Riviere) has no idea where such a place would be, since she has no idea how to be happy in the first place. Men in the street are attracted to her slender figure, and try to pick her up; complete strangers find themselves able to speak to her with ease; and yet she never feels comfortable, or really loved for who she is.Eric Rohmer took a more relaxed and improvisational approach than usual for this film, letting his actors (particularly Riviere) and as a result the comedy is genuinely adorably loopy, and falls into the rhythms of actual bourgeois dialogue. This is the rare film where the conversation is genuinely witty but doesn't feel like it was dreamed up by a roomful of screenwriters actively trying for snappy dialogue (there are almost no one-liners). Delphine drifts over the course of a free July holiday from her home in Paris (where she works as a secretary) to Cherbourg to the mountains and then to Biarritz. Everyone she meets seems to like her, but they always question her approach to finding happiness, making her all the more miserable. There have been few films that have really captured the ghastliness of not feeling at home in the world in quite such a peculiarly sunny way. The long takes, the slight seediness of most of Delphine's vacation sites (particularly Biarritz), and the odd social situations in which she finds herself trapped (such as her hateful experience of being forced to listen to a freethinking Swedish woman she's befriended pick up a local on the French Riviera) add to the film's memorable drollness. The film's most likable sequence involves Delphine eavesdropping on a group of older tourists discussing Jules Verne's THE GREEN RAY, and the celestial meanings of its title, alongside an ocean lookout; though the sequence is largely expository, the relaxed rhythms of the older group, so at odds with the more desperately love-hungry discussions of Delphine's younger companions, seems to promise the wisdom that will await her as she ages.",5,Not at home,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,2119,"['difficulty', 'vacations', 'sometimes', 'knowing', 'where', 'go', 'so', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', '1986', 'comedy', 'Delphine', 'Marie', 'Riviere', 'idea', 'where', 'place', 'would', 'be', 'idea', 'how', 'be', 'happy', 'first', 'place', 'Men', 'street', 'are', 'attracted', 'slender', 'figure', 'try', 'pick', 'up', 'complete', 'strangers', 'find', 'able', 'speak', 'ease', 'yet', 'never', 'comfortable', 'really', 'loved', 'who', 'is.Eric', 'Rohmer', 'took', 'more', 'relaxed', 'improvisational', 'approach', 'usual', 'film', 'letting', 'actors', 'particularly', 'Riviere', 'result', 'comedy', 'genuinely', 'adorably', 'loopy', 'rhythms', 'actual', 'bourgeois', 'dialogue', 'rare', 'film', 'where', 'conversation', 'genuinely', 'witty', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'dreamed', 'up', 'roomful', 'screenwriters', 'actively', 'trying', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'are', 'almost', 'one-liners', 'Delphine', 'drifts', 'course', 'free', 'July', 'holiday', 'home', 'Paris', 'where', 'secretary', 'Cherbourg', 'mountains', 'then', 'Biarritz', 'Everyone', 'like', 'always', 'question', 'approach', 'finding', 'happiness', 'making', 'more', 'miserable', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'really', 'captured', 'ghastliness', 'not', 'feeling', 'home', 'world', 'quite', 'such', 'peculiarly', 'sunny', 'way', 'long', 'slight', 'seediness', 'most', 'Delphine', 'vacation', 'sites', 'particularly', 'Biarritz', 'odd', 'social', 'situations', 'trapped', 'such', 'hateful', 'experience', 'being', 'forced', 'listen', 'freethinking', 'Swedish', 'woman', 'befriended', 'pick', 'up', 'local', 'French', 'Riviera', 'add', 'film', 'memorable', 'drollness', 'film', 'most', 'likable', 'sequence', 'Delphine', 'eavesdropping', 'group', 'older', 'tourists', 'discussing', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'THE', 'GREEN', 'RAY', 'celestial', 'meanings', 'title', 'ocean', 'lookout', 'sequence', 'largely', 'expository', 'relaxed', 'rhythms', 'older', 'group', 'so', 'odds', 'more', 'desperately', 'love-hungry', 'discussions', 'Delphine', 'younger', 'companions', 'promise', 'wisdom', 'will', 'await']",N/A

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[6, 7]","Delphine (Marie Rivi&egrave;re) is a young woman that doesn't exactly know what she wants in life, and that is unable to relate well to others. In her own words, ""I'm not very operational in life"".That characteristic is specially easy to see when, due to unforeseen circumstances, she goes on holidays alone. She visits many places, but there is always a problem: her. Delphine feels she needs someone to be complete, and gets depressed because she doesn't seem to attract the opposite sex. On the other hand, when young men get near her she rejects them, as they are not what she is looking for. Will that change?

Our young anti-heroine here is a young Parisian, Delphine, who finds herself without a companion for the upcoming August vacation sabbatical, which those blessed French enjoy. Her friends try to help on the surface and toss around some shallow advice.Delphine tries several trips away from Paris, however finds herself back in the empty streets of Paris, unable to cope with the loneliness of not fitting in with the summer crowd. Her attempts to communicate even her simplest feelings, e.g. her vegetarianism, or her reluctance to let the typical resort guys hit on her, fall flat, without any one understanding.Rohmer's film is truly an expose' on the human condition of loneliness. Delphine's alienation is accentuated against the back drop of the sun dappled French seaside,full of colors, children, and lovers, where everything is so uncomplicated and connected, and everyone is seemingly so happy.As the film is closing, our heroine finds her hope when the special rays of the setting sun, poke through to save the day.

Once again Eric Rohmer demonstrates why his work is so justly praised. He has the gift of taking the simplest plotline, one that shouldn't be able to sustain itself for more than a few minutes, and weaving subtle beauty & depth out of it. There's never any sense of padding, of being self-consciously ""artistic"" ... and yet everything unfolds with such natural & unaffected grace.In this story of Delphine's summer vacation, he presents us with a charming, quietly assertive young woman who knows what she wants, and refuses to settle for less. Not that she comes across as ambitious, or self-centered, or narcissistic! No, she has some deeper connection to the world around her -- not a connection of mastery or snobbery, but an awareness, a respect for both it & herself. And her refusal to accept something less than what she (and everyone else) deserves is rewarded, as the blessing of the titular Green Ray touches her at last.The only thing wrong here is the so-so quality of the DVD, which I see has been discontinued. I can only hope that it's released once more in a form that does it justice. Criterion, are you listening?
