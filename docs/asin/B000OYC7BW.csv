If nothing else, this movie shows an entirely different side of Jim Carrey - not a single joke is made (a few lame ones but Jim's clearly not trying to be funny). It's like Carrey is a grown up now, playing with the real kids. Except, that his talent is in comedy and he excels at it. Carrey carries the movie (pun intended), but there is stil something missing - suspense or intensity, or whatever it is that would truly make this film great.",3,must be watched in its unrated format,1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,574,"['well-envisioned', 'movie', 'interesting', 'concept', 'numerology', 'smart', 'film', 'probably', 'went', 'lot', 'people', 'heads', 'nothing', 'else', 'movie', 'entirely', 'different', 'side', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'not', 'single', 'joke', 'made', 'few', 'lame', 'ones', 'Jim', 'clearly', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'Carrey', 'grown', 'up', 'now', 'playing', 'real', 'kids', 'talent', 'comedy', 'Carrey', 'movie', 'pun', 'intended', 'stil', 'something', 'missing', 'suspense', 'intensity', 'whatever', 'would', 'truly', 'make', 'film', 'great']",N/A

I personally admire him more in comedies, but this movie proved that he could play any role in acting. I saw The Number 23 couple of times. It made me a big impression then I saw this film the first time, because I didn't know anything what was going to happen and the most interesting thing is that the movie kept the tension all the time till the end. Even in the end of the movie, when everything became more clear, there raised a new question - &#34;why&#34;, which kept the tension even more longer.The idea of this movie is mystical. The name of the film tells us a small hint - number 23. Everything what happens in this movie is connected to this number and the main character (Jim Carrey) gets obsessed with this thing. His obsession evolves to actions what finally ends in a very unexpected way.I was trying to look at this situation logically. From the experience I've got and the books I've read I know that everything is possible to explain in reasonable way. One of the facts is that we see what we want to see and where we concentrate our attention. Moreover, it depends on what is usually going on in our heads. After watching this movie, couple next days I saw number 23 couple of times. I payed attention to that, that's why I saw it. I didn't count the times I saw other numbers those days and that doesn't mean that number 23 was following me.Wish you a great watching!

1067194,AP9UOXX9272YO,B000OYC7BW,"Amazon Customer ""Noble Poet""","[4, 7]","23.  One star for acting and creative script idea. (Jim Carrey was not all that bad, believe it or not)22.  One star for cinematography and music.  I enjoyed the ""artsiness"" of the film as well as its music.  The music successfully set the mood of the film.21.  You get lost in the film's paranoid state, which gets tiring.  The story kinda drags along slowly.20.  The story wasn't all too credible.  The fact that the book was sold in the store in the first place didn't make sense to me (watch the end and you may understand).19.  The ""mystery"" within the story about the ""real"" murder seemed implausible.18.  What the ""loving"" wife (Virgina Madsen) did seemed evil, considering how long she ""knew"" (again, I don't want to spoil anything but if you watch it, you may know what I mean).17.  What happened with the psychiatrist?  He kinda just walked off screen at the end--literally.  He seemed like an important character for a minor role.16.  The story drags itself out very long.  I know I said it already, but it's worth saying it again.15.  What was the role of the dog?  Was it supposed to play Fate?14.  I'm not quite sure I'd call this a thriller.  I'd label it more like an intoxicated mystery film.  It's like trying to stay drunk for an entire day.  Every time you start sobering up and things seem to make sense around you, you take another swig and the head-spinning comes back.13.  Why is this not a thriller?  I heard more laughs than skipped heart beats.  To me, thriller movies surprise you.  Things pop out of nowhere to scare you.  No surprises here.  No need to grab hold of your honey because of a ""scary"" moment.  Just circles.12.  Is this movie suspenseful?  Barely.  Whatever Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) knows, we know.  Whatever he doesn't know, we find out very shortly afterwards, thus the suspense is lost.  Whenever you start to wonder something, it's explained in a snap.  A good suspense film keeps you on your toes wondering what's going to happen next.  It keeps you wondering how it all ends.  It makes you ask yourself ""Why?"" about a dozen times throughout the film with none of them answered until the end.  If you really wanted to call this a suspense film, it's weak.11.  The paranoia of ""Walter Sparrow"" is laughable, but then again, Jim Carrey is known for his comedy.10.  The beginning starts off great, as if you expect to get bathed with suspense, but it suddenly falls flat.  It's like a ""good"" rollercoaster, which the only reason you give it a ""good"" is due to the great drop in the beginning of the ride.  Afterwards, the ride slows down and all that's left are a few loops and turns and the ride's over.9.  Some characters were just underdeveloped.  The son, for instance.  He could have made a better effect on the story had he been developed more.  Same with the wife.8.  The story dragged.  Oh wait, I said that already. . .onto 7!7.  I said I liked the cinematography, so I'm changing gears here to talk about something good.  The camera shots were well done and the quick when they had to be, thus creating good energy for the film at times.  Though the story dragged on and on, I don't blame the cameras, but I blame the script.  Lighting was good and the music was right on the money.6.  The scene with the priest and the dog was really poor.  That scene in particular seemed obviously acted out, if you know what I mean.  They could've wrote a better interaction with them in the script.5.  After bashing the one part of the script, I did say in the beginning that I liked the script ""idea.""  The storyline was there.  Lets face it--most people who went to see this did so because they were curious about the relationships between all these dates of important events such as 9-11-2001, and the number 23.  So when first seeing the previews of this film, I thought it was a great idea for a story.  I still think it is great material for a story, but just not this story.4.  In the story, it talks about ""beating 23"" as if 23 was a haunting number, or all this was some sort of game.  The story didn't really finish up on that thought, so why even put that idea in there?  I actually think the storyline would've been stronger if they went this way.3.  Not sure why this film was rated ""R.""  At best, PG-13.  It wasn't scary.  The violence was not all that different from a teen-horror flick rated PG-13.  Even the sexual content in this film was not much; you never saw beneath the lingerie.  The language was mild.  What made this film rated ""R""?2.  I suppose I could give this  film another half star since now all my friends are texting me everything they see in relation to ""23,"" such as birthdays and signs they see.  Even I spotted the car parked next to me had ""23"" and the gas price up the road was at $2.30/gallon.  So this film did bring a half hour of small ""fun"" annoyances.1.  So if you've actually read this entire review, I'm shocked and surprised.  I was trying to drag out 21 reasons why I didn't like this movie, with 2 good reasons why I did.  Did the review seemed forced?  Dragged out too much?  Yeah, it explains the way it felt when watching this film.  Clever storyline, decent acting, and respectable cinematography is all that is worth noting.  If you thought this review was boring and dragged out, wait'll you see the movie (if you just can't help yourself).",2,23 Reasons why I gave this 2 stars,1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,5343,"['23',

They say it doesn't mean anything, but for Walter Sparrow, the number 23 quickly becomes his whole world and he begins seeing it in everything he sets his eyes on.At first things appear to be mere coincidence--the numerical value of his name (23), his birthday (2/3), but as time goes on, the number seems to take on a life of its own and leads him down a pathway to darkness and psychosis.Jim Carrey stars as Walter Sparrow in this Joel Schumacher-directed flick and once again Carrey proves he's more than just a goofball actor. Carrey plays the serious role well. He blew me away in Man on the Moon. I loved him Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind. If anything, I prefer him in his more dramatic roles than playing the funny man.Virginia Madsen did an excellent job portraying Sparrow's wife. The unconditional love she had for her husband was in every scene even when things got crazy.My first reaction as to how it all wrapped up left me wanting more, then, after thinking about it prior to writing this review, the way it all came together in the end worked perfectly.This is a movie for those who enjoy intrigue, the hidden threads of Reality and how exploring those threads leads a person down the dangerous and dark path of obsession and skewed perception of the world around them.Numerology, which plays a part in the Reality you and I live in, is dangerous and this movie shows why. Though this was a work of fiction, the dangers of getting into numerology are real. It has the potential to control you.

1067197,A2VMT89TCSF105,B000OYC7BW,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[1, 1]","""Number 23"" is a thriller starring Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen.The plot revolves around a certain Walter Sparrow, who finds out that a novel his wife has given him as a birthday present seems to be about his own life! Unfortunately, the main character of the novel is a murderer with a strange obsession with the number 23. Naturally, Sparrow also develops the same obsession. As the plot thickens, it seems that a real murderer is on the loose, and that somebody very close to Sparrow himself wrote the novel. Before he goes completely insane, Sparrow has to find the real killer, reveal the author of the mysterious novel, and get rid of his paranoid obsession with 23...I agree with many other reviewers that ""Number 23"" could have been much, much better. It's not the best movie around the block. Still, it's surprisingly tolerable. Also, the concept is interesting and contains several unexpected twists and turns. At first, I was annoyed by Jim Carrey, who is really a comic actor. However, he is quite good at portraying a paranoiac - at least a Hollywood stereotype paranoiac.My main problem with ""Number 23"" are the loose ends and illogical situations. I didn't understand what on earth the dog named Ned has to do with the plot! Since the murder Sparrow is investigating took place 13 years earlier, it can't possibly be the same dog. Dogs don't live that long...However, if you can swallow these kinds of inconveniences, you might nevertheless find ""Number 23"" interesting.According to Wikipedia, there actually are conspiracy theorists who believe that the number 23 has esoteric significance.

This is one of those movies where you hate to tell people anything about it, because almost anything I could say would be a spoiler.Walter Sparrow is a dog-catcher. But because he had only two minutes left to work on his birthday, February 3 (2/3), he was sent out on assignment at the last minute and his whole life changed. The dog he attempted to capture bit him and got away, and while he was getting the bite taken care of, his wife wandered into a used bookstore and bought a book for him named ""The Number 23."" It was hand-typed and hand bound, and the pictures were pasted in; it was clearly a one-of-a-kind hand-made book.I just can't do it. I can't tell you about all the startling things that happen as Walter notices some interesting parallels between his own life and that in the book, nominally a novel. And he starts seeing the number 23 everywhere. He gets into adding numbers together that add up to 23, he consults with a friend who is apparently a shrink, and tells him something of the lore of numerology and how 23 is indeed a significant magical number.There's a fair amount of sex and violence in this movie, but it's not disgusting.

I grew up as a teenager in the 90's knowing Jim Carrey as a comedian, and so that's how I perceive Jim Carrey whenever I see him play a part in a movie.  In fact, anything besides a funny role seems a bit out of place to me.  Maybe it's just because I'm not used to it.  Maybe he has to star in more serious roles for me to adjust to the big change.Something was extremely odd about the storyline right from the get go.  It seemed to jump around in a very mysterious way, almost like trying to figure out whether a person is dreaming or experiencing something real.  A very unsettling atmosphere that tells a mysterious story is mainly what you can expect in the beginning.  I can't explain it though.  It's really strange, but you know, strange is a GOOD thing when it involves something radically different (such as the case with this movie).If you pay attention to the storyline, eventually some surprising twists can be found involving some of the main characters.  I was really surprised with one moment involving a family member (I won't say who).Now, I don't really get all the 23 coincidences.  Throughout the film they make a HUGE deal about the number 23 and how the number has some kind of incredible importance in what the fate of mankind is going to be, and also the connections the number has to past events, such as famous bombings and the dates they happened on.  Really, it's just a number, and you can probably add, subtract, multiply and divide any number you want and find some kind of connection to a past event.  It's really easy to do.  It's just not very believable, and honestly, it felt like watching an episode of that TV show Numbers on several occasions.  Still, I can't ignore the unusual atmosphere the movie had.Overall, a very interesting movie that's probably even better the second time you watch it.",5,suspense with a mysterious edge,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,1881,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'movie', 'grew', 'up', 'teenager', '90', 'knowing', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'comedian', 'so', 'how', 'perceive', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'whenever', 'see', 'play', 'part', 'movie', 'fact', 'anything', 'funny', 'role', 'bit', 'place', 'Maybe', 'just', ""'m"", 'not', 'used', 'Maybe', 'star', 'more', 'serious', 'roles', 'adjust', 'big', 'change.Something', 'was', 'extremely', 'odd', 'storyline', 'right', 'get', 'go', 'seemed', 'jump', 'around', 'very', 'mysterious', 'way', 'almost', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'person', 'dreaming', 'experiencing', 'something', 'real', 'very', 'unsettling', 'atmosphere', 'mysterious', 'story', 'mainly', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'beginning', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'really', 'strange', 'know', 'strange', 'GOOD', 'thing', 'when', 'something', 'radically', 'different', 'such', 'case', 'movie', 'pay', 'attention', 'storyline', 'eventually', 'surprising', 'twists', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'involving', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'one', 'moment', 'involving', 'family', 'member', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'who', '.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', '23', 'coincidences', 'film', 'make', 'HUGE', 'deal', 'number', '23', 'how', 'number', 'kind', 'incredible', 'importance', 'what', 'fate', 'mankind', 'going', 'be', 'also', 'connections', 'number', 'past', 'events', 'such', 'famous', 'bombings', 'dates', 'happened', 'Really', 'just', 'number', 'can', 'probably', 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', 'number', 'want', 'find', 'kind', 'connection', 'past', 'event', 'really', 'easy', 'do', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'honestly', 'felt', 'watching', 'episode', 'TV', 'show', 'Numbers', 'several', 'occasions', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'unusual', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'had.Overall', 'very', 'interesting', 'movie', 'probably', 'even', 'better', 'second', 'time', 'watch']",N/A

Jim Carrey without the hype tried to be a Jack Webb-style detective to get to the root of who is torturing him. He is essentially in the role of old where he was most comfortable, the animal control dog catcher who tells stories to those he managed to capture. Needless to say, he is inept as he goes around in a haze remembering the bad things which had happened to him back to the one-room schoolhouse where he discovered the world of numbers. He appeared to have been one of the unfortunate people with low intelligence (like the rude woman who heckled me constantly from the seat behind me -- a low life if there ever was one), but somewhat of a whiz at numbers. It's amazing how numbers connect (even my new phone number uses my apartment number -- strange!).Some of his crazy fantasizing included porn which the popcorn-eating sub-human (a horrid type) racously laughed at the cruel things taking place on the screen. Some don;t know they are in public and need to act accordingly. Walter's wife asks him to read a self-printed, self-published red book about a murder of passionnever solved as the body was never found. One victim looked just like Vicky in the recent tragedy in Hollywood, Florida.

She looked like Paula Gumpman in the flasbacks of kinky nightmares of events in this book. Dr. Phoenix with his red tie looked like Clark Gable and was a mathematician who told of strange occurrences in history of weird stuff taking place on the 23rd. Is that number a blessing or a curse. Hiroshima bomb may be repeated on 12-12-2012, according to Euclid's geometry at the University of Chicago where the bomb was hatched.The avante guarde shops looked like some in Pigeon Forge in the mountains and the large bus with route 23, was not Fairmont.

1067201,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000OYC7BW,Brian E. Erland,"[1, 1]","The '07 release of the psychological drama `The Number 23' is a mixed bag that attempts to weave together the details of the life of seemingly average guy Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) by moving back and forth between two worlds of contradictory information. One world is a surreal, almost hallucinogenic realm comprised of fragmentary dream images, long forgotten memories and the ongoing storyline of a rather obscure self-published book Walter's reading. This interior world is placed in juxtaposition to the more accessible day to day details of his rather mundane life as a husband, father and canine control officer (dog catcher).Some segments of the film are quite good, others not so well. The pace is also a little too slow and the plot too predictable to really hold your attention in the manner hoped for. I found myself comparing both the cinematic style of the film and the storyline with other films that `The Number 23' must have surely borrowed from. I see a lot of `Sin City' in its dark and shadowy artistic style and narrative and the plot borrows heavily from `The Haunted Strangler' an old Boris Karloff film from the late fifties. I assume that if I'm thinking of other films while watching this one something must be wrong.My Rating: It could have been a lot better but it's worth a watch.

First off, you have no clue as to how it is going to end, and is possibly the best movie ever created to keep your mind in question to the very last minute before it slaps you.People have talked badly about the scenes where ""Jim"" is acting as a detective, but it is supposed to be portrayed in how a regular guy would see things happening, if he were imagining himself as the character in a book he were reading. It has the feel of a comic book to some degree, because it is portrayed in an artistic sense and not a literal, serious acting sense.The story is one of the most brilliant I have ever witnessed, and all the acting was as it should be. Me and everyone I questioned agreed that Jim plays a more convincing ""Mentally Insane"" person than Johnny Depp even came close to in ""Secret Window"".

And Virginia Madsen, I believe, can be quite underrated.  When she made a comeback in the movie ""Sideways"" (I believe that that was her comeback vehicle) she was very good.  I can't imagine anyone else being in that role and doing as well.So it's somewhat surprising that I've waited so long to see this movie.  The problem was, I'm not much of a fan of numerology films.  They tend to be flimsy and unwatchable.  For example, I tried to watch a couple of films entitled something like 11/11 and they were both really terrible.  Numbers are just numbers; people tend to give them too much meaning, and people tend to bring their own biases into those numbers and try to infer some meaning that just isn't there.And that would be the set-up I suppose in this film-noirish/Hitchcockian affair.  While watching, you think about other movies you've seen with odd twists, and you think to yourself, ""OK.  I know where this is going and so I think so and so did it.""  But that would be just a trap.  What really happens seems to be more profound that what you think might be possible, and there is meaning in a movie that seems to overdo it with the number 23.

The character he plays in The Number 23, Walter Sparrow, is kind of low key and reminds me of his Joel Barish in 2004's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Fingerling on the other hand, is a total psycho. The Cable Guy on crack and steroids? Robin Williams is another comedian who seemed like he really wanted to play the boogie man for a change: Death to Smoochy, One Hour Photo, Insomnia, he's not a very nice guy in August Rush, either. Just an observation that two of filmdom's funniest fellows have a similar obsession with playing against type.--------------------Walter Sparrow: Of course time is just a counting system... numbers with meanings attached to them.================Speaking of obsession, in The Number 23 Fingerling the detective had an obsession with the saxophone. The saxophone has 23 keys. A lot of the ""23"" connections seem a little far fetched, like if you are looking for any number you can find it everywhere, but the number 23 in particular has held a fascination for many people, and even Jim Carrey claims to have a ""23"" obsession. William S. Burroughs, the Beat author of Naked Lunch, The Wild Boys, and The Nova Express, also came to believe that the number 23 held mystical significance after encountering it during significant moments in his life. He wrote ""The Last Words of Dutch Schultz"" where he took the recorded tape of the mobster's rambling last words and wove a story based on Schultz's life, and the way that Burroughs told it, it revolved around recurrences of the number 23. ""The Number 23"" is loosely based on Burroughs' ""The Last Words of Dutch Schultz.""--------------------Walter Sparrow: I once read that the only philosophical question that matters, is whether or not to commit suicide... I guess that makes me a philosopher.================The Bottom Line is that The Number 23 is entertaining on several levels: It is a good film noir, murder mystery, and also delves into obsessions, numerology, and the mystical significance some see in certain numbers (another good film that I would recommend if you like this aspect of The Number 23 is Pi). The Number 23 was well directed by Joel Schumacher. Jim Carrey, Virginia Madsen, and the rest of the cast did a superb job. Included on the DVD is some great bonus material that deals with the psychology of OCD, phobias and obsessions about certain numbers. There is even a Numerologist who shows how you can determine your significant numbers, much like in astrology. The Number 23 was the 23rd film directed by Joel Schumacher.--------------------Walter Sparrow: I'd like two words on my tombstone: what if.================8MM(1999) Directed by Joel SchumacherBatman Forever(1995) Directed by Joel Schumacher; Jim Carrey was Riddler / Dr. Edward NygmaYes Man (Two-Disc Special Edition)(2008) Jim Carrey was CarlEternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (Widescreen Edition)(2004) Jim Carrey was Joel BarishMan on the Moon (Ws)(1999) (also as Tony Clifton) Jim Carrey was AndyThe Cable Guy(1996) Jim Carrey was The Cable GuyDumb and Dumber(1994) Jim Carrey was Lloyd ChristmasA Prairie Home Companion(2006) Virginia Madsen was Dangerous WomanSideways(2004) Virginia Madsen was MayaDune (Extended Edition)(1984) Virginia Madsen was Princess Irulan--------------------Be sure your sin will find you out. -

1067207,A278AF56R7J86,B000OYC7BW,"C. Crockett ""Domino713""","[2, 6]","I feel that this psychological mind bend of a film has garnered a bit of undeserved criticism. While ""The Number 23"" won't appeal to everyone, it is still an intricate and freaky look into a man's numeral obsession.Jim Carrey stars as Walter -- a bored dog catcher who get's sucked into an obsession with the number 23 after his wife gives him a book on his birthday (one in which the number 23 plays a vital role in the unhinging of it's characters). Walter drifts back and forth between his real life and growing obsession, and the story detailed with the blood red novel about a bad-boy detective and his quest to understand the curse of the number 23.As we've seen him do in films likeThe Truman Show (Special Collector's Edition)andThe Majestic, Jim Carrey stretches his acting chops by completely abandoning his stereotypical funny man role, and digging deep into a slightly more serious, and in this case quite sinister role. When we see one of the greatest comedic talents in a completely twisted and dark film, it challenges us to try to forget our own biases about Carrey, and try to take him seriously in this oddity of a character. I think that Carrey pulled it off beautifully, but I know there are others who would disagree with me.Weird can be good. If a film is going to do ""weird"", it's important to do it right, otherwise it will just come off as unentertainingly bizarre and dull. The cinematography in this movie is incredible. The camera angles and colors uniquely work together to pull the viewer into Walter's demented mind as he visualizes himself experiencing the life of this mysterious Detective and the obsession with the number 23.The 23 enigma is a real occurence. Many of it's examples are illustrated in the film. However, it's also a fact that if you're looking hard enough for something, such as the repitition of a number, then you're bound to find it. Some examples of the odd recurrence of the number 23 include:**William Shakespeare was born on the 23rd, and died on the 23rd.**Julius Cesaer was stabbed 23 times.**The Titanic sank on April 15, 1912. April is the 4th month, which means 4+1+5+1+9+1+2= 23**The Earth revolves on an axis tilted at an angle of 23.5 (23 is right there in the number, and 5 is simply 2+3).** I wrote this review on the 23rd of July. (...okay, so that last one isn't really relevant to this movie, but you get the idea...)These and many other examples are given. A fun fact for this movie would be that Jim Carrey himself actually has a fascination with the 23 enigma. While he was explaining it to a friend one day, his friend laughed and told him that he had just read a new script called the Number 23, and that it was about exactly what Jim was describing. Jim eagerly asked to read the script, and signed on to do the film shortly after.Some people don't feel that Jim Carrey was the right choice for the role. I think they are wrong. I found him engaging, and he was well complimented by the performance of Virginia Madsen as his wife (even though Elizabeth Shue was originally set to do the role, she had to back out after she became pregnant shortly after agreeing to do the film).When you hit ""play"" on the DVD, it will give you the option of watching the rated R theatrical version, or the extended unrated version. The main difference between the two is that the unrated version has more sex scenes in it. If you don't like overly gratuitous sex scenes, then go ahead and watch the rated R version. I personally recommend the unrated version.Bottom line, it's worth a try. It's weird, it's bizarre, it's cooky, and it's a real mind trip...but it's a lot of fun in the process.",4,One Man's Obsession becomes a Weird and Mind-Bending Thriller...,1185148800,"07 23, 2007",2007,3653,"['feel', 'psychological', 'mind', 'bend', 'film', 'garnered', 'bit', 'undeserved', 'criticism', 'Number', '23', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'everyone', 'still', 'intricate', 'freaky', 'look', 'man', 'numeral', 'obsession.Jim', 'Carrey', 'Walter', 'bored', 'dog', 'catcher', 'who', 'get', 'sucked', 'obsession', 'number', '23', 'wife', 'book', 'birthday', 'one', 'number', '23', 'vital', 'role', 'unhinging', 'characters', 'Walter', 'drifts', 'back', 'forth', 'real', 'life', 'growing', 'obsession', 'story', 'detailed', 'blood', 'red', 'novel', 'bad-boy', 'detective', 'quest', 'understand', 'curse', 'number', '23.As', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', 'films', 'likeThe', 'Truman', 'Show', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Majestic', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'acting', 'chops', 'completely', 'abandoning', 'stereotypical', 'funny', 'man', 'role', 'digging', 'deep', 'slightly', 'more', 'serious', 'case', 'quite', 'sinister', 'role', 'When', 'see', 'one', 'greatest', 'comedic', 'talents', 'completely', 'twisted', 'dark', 'film', 'try', 'forget', 'own', 'biases', 'Carrey', 'try', 'take', 'seriously', 'oddity', 'character', 'think', 'Carrey', 'pulled', 'off', 'beautifully', 'know', 'are', 'others', 'who', 'would', 'disagree', 'me.Weird', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'going', 'do', 'weird', 'important', 'do', 'right', 'otherwise', 'will', 'just', 'come', 'off', 'unentertainingly', 'bizarre', 'dull', 'cinematography', 'movie', 'incredible', 'camera', 'angles', 'colors', 'uniquely', 'work', 'together', 'pull', 'viewer', 'Walter', 'demented', 'mind', 'experiencing', 'life', 'mysterious', 'Detective', 'obsession', 'number', '23.The', '23', 'enigma', 'real', 'occurence', 'Many', 'examples', 'are', 'illustrated', 'film', 'However', 'also', 'fact', ""'re"", 'looking', 'hard', 'enough', 'something', 'such', 'repitition', 'number', 'then', ""'re"", 'bound', 'find', 'examples', 'odd', 'recurrence', 'number', '23', 'include', '**William', 'Shakespeare', 'was', 'born', '23rd', 'died', '23rd', '**Julius', 'Cesaer', 'was', 'stabbed', '23', 'times', '**The', 'Titanic', 'sank', 'April', '15', '1912', 'April', '4th', 'month', '4+1+5+1+9+1+2=', '23**The', 'Earth', 'revolves', 'axis', 'tilted', 'angle', '23.5', '23', 'right', 'there', 'number', '5', 'simply', '2+3', '**', 'wrote', 'review', '23rd', 'July', 'okay', 'last', 'one', ""n't"", 'really', 'relevant', 'movie', 'get', 'idea', 'many', 'other', 'examples', 'are', 'given', 'fun', 'fact', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'actually', 'fascination', '23', 'enigma', 'was', 'explaining', 'friend', 'one', 'day', 'friend', 'laughed', 'told', 'had', 'just', 'read', 'new', 'script', 'called', 'Number', '23', 'was', 'about', 'exactly', 'what', 'Jim', 'was', 'describing', 'Jim', 'eagerly', 'asked', 'read', 'script', 'signed', 'do', 'film', 'shortly', 'after.Some', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'was', 'right', 'choice', 'role', 'think', 'are', 'wrong', 'found', 'engaging', 'was', 'well', 'complimented', 'performance', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'wife', 'even', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'was', 'originally', 'set', 'do', 'role', 'had', 'back', 'out', 'became', 'pregnant', 'shortly', 'agreeing', 'do', 'film', '.When', 'hit', 'play', 'DVD', 'will', 'give', 'option', 'watching', 'rated', 'R', 'theatrical', 'version', 'extended', 'unrated', 'version', 'main', 'difference', 'two', 'unrated', 'version', 'more', 'sex', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'overly', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'scenes', 'then', 'go', 'ahead', 'watch', 'rated', 'R', 'version', 'personally', 'recommend', 'unrated', 'version.Bottom', 'line', 'try', 'weird', 'bizarre', 'cooky', 'real', 'mind', 'trip', 'lot', 'fun', 'process']",N/A
1067208,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000OYC7BW,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 3]","A willing viewer of Joel Schumacher's ""The Number 23"" will discover that watching it has some interesting side effects. In my case, I began thinking about how twenty-three is prevalent in my life: I'm currently twenty-three years old; there are twenty-three typed characters when ""Chris Pandolfi"" is combined with ""Amazon.com."" A coincidence, I'm sure, but doesn't it make you wonder? In terms of the film itself, I became perceptive to certain numbers that were casually presented throughout; an outside shot of a bookstore shows its address as being 599. Add those numbers together and see what you get.I'm having fun with this, but in all seriousness, ""The Number 23"" is a fascinating psychological thriller, purposely constructed as a mind game for the audience to participate in. We're immediately introduced to animal control officer Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) on his birthday, which just happens to fall on February third (2/3). Most of his day is incredibly boring; he just sits in his van drinking coffee, waiting for a loose animal to run by. After hours of waiting, he's asked to remove a mixed bulldog from the back of a Chinese restaurant. It seems to regard him with contempt, which is probably why it bites him and runs off. He then chases it to a local cemetery. While he doesn't manage to catch it, he does notice that it rests in front of a specific tombstone.This incident forces Walter to be late in meeting his wife, Agatha (Virginia Madsen), outside of a used book shop. But no worries; she passes the time by reading an unpublished manuscript. By the time Walter arrives, she decides to give it to her husband as a kind of late birthday present. It's called ""The Number 23,"" a novel of paranoia written by the obscure Topsy Krett. The foreword warns that if characters and circumstances seem even remotely familiar to the reader, then it's best to not continue the story. Reverse psychology is at work, here; Krett is practically daring the reader to turn to the first page and find out why such a warning was written in the first place. Like any curious reader would do, Walter plunges directly into the manuscript.As he begins reading, he envisions himself as the main character, nicknamed Fingerling. The story is quite similar to that of a pulp detective novel, and it unfolds in sequences so stylized that they almost come off as campy. The world in Krett's novel is dripping with atmosphere: every visual makes use of a saturated color scheme; every character is mysterious, moody, sensuous, and sinister; every descriptive paragraph and line of dialogue is borderline cliche. It told the story of a detective on the case of suicidal blonde woman. She was consumed by the number twenty-three, which seemed to mirror every aspect of her life. It was both fun and baffling to watch these sequences: on the one hand, they effectively reinterpret reality as a living comic book; on the other hand, they seemed too over the top to do justice to the mystery and paranoia that soon take hold of Walter.This is because--despite the specific details being different--he immediately notices how eerily similar the book is to his own life. Fingerling tracks down felons and victims, Walter tracks stray animals. Both Fingerling and Walter collected detective magazines as kids. Both their futures were perfectly envisioned by demanding fathers. Most importantly, both are becoming obsessed with the number twenty-three, so much so that they continually get dark visions. Fingerling keeps having nightmares of murdering his girlfriend, a sultry Italian named Fabrizia (also played by Virginia Madsen). Walter eventually has the same nightmares about Agatha, and it rightfully makes him question how sane a person he really is. ""You'd never hurt me,"" Agatha tells him reassuringly. She then goes to kiss Walter, only to hear him reply, ""How do you know?""There's some clever manipulation going on here, especially in terms of the manuscript itself. On every twenty-third page, Walter circles every twenty-third word, which reveal a hidden message. The writer, whoever he is, is obviously trying to send a message. To who and about what, Walter has yet to discover. But he gets closer when he learns of a woman named Laura Tollins, who was murdered fifteen years earlier. Not only was her body never found, the man serving time for her murder is also adamantly denying any wrongdoing. If he's telling the truth, then that means her killer is still roaming the streets.How does this connect with Krett and his manuscript? What, if anything, does the number twenty-three actually represent? Is the manuscript, in fact, a warped reflection of Walter Sparrow's life? Why does the mixed bulldog keep reappearing? Why is the twenty-third chapter missing from the end of the manuscript? This is a list of questions for you to consider when watching this movie. I can assure you that all of them will be answered. What I cannot assure you is that you'll be satisfied with the answers. While the film's final revelations aren't particularly bad, I still found them somewhat disappointing. For a film of considerable craft, the ending seemed a little too simplistic and formulaic. Nonetheless, I'm going to recommend ""The Number 23,"" if not for the engaging mystery, then for the sheer delight in watching Jim Carrey perform in a dramatic role. I'll also recommend it for it's clever manipulation of numbers. After all, it was released on February 23 for a reason.",4,His Number is Up,1172707200,"03 1, 2007",2007,5469,"['willing', 'viewer', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'Number', '23', 'will', 'discover',

I was absolutely amazed by this film.  Granted, I will admit that I am a big Jim Carrey fan, however I don't like and enjoy all of his movies(Eternal Sunshine, The Cable Guy to name a few).  But I feel he did an applaudable job with this role.  I don't feel the need to tell you about the plot and synopsis of this movie, as I am sure most are already aware of the generalization of this motion picture.  But with all of the negative comments I am reading from alot of people, I am just curious to what really keeps you entertained for a good 1 1/2-2 hours.  Is your attention span too short to stay focused long enough to get the gist of the story?  Granted, this movie might take a couple viewings to fully understand it and appreciate it(I had to rewind a few parts to pick up on the little subtleties), but it is well worth it.  And the actual ending is a very nice way of closing the film, as the whole book Carey is reading(The Number 23....Duh!) is explained, and how his life is reflected in it is fully and finally understood and revealed.  It's a real head scratcher at first, but is fully appreciated after you grasp the full understanding and concept of it all.  Beautifully directed by Joel Schumacher, and brilliant performances by Carey and cast(who knew he could actually do anything other than comedy so naturally) make this a very memorable movie and well worth picking up.  If you are still skeptical on purchasing this movie then at least do yourself a favor and rent it.  I hope to see Carey casted in more films like this in the future.  Very well done!  You will not be disappointed!",5,Pure mind-bending entertainment!

1067210,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000OYC7BW,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 3]","Joel Schumacher has always been the kind of filmmaker that we love to bash because he just makes it so easy. Sure now and then he makes something surprising such as Tigerland or Phone Booth but by and large he's always been extremely unreliable at making good movies. And let's not forget the debacle that was the Batman films he did. Now, he sets his sights on the idea that patterns and numbers hold mystical significance and that we're surrounded by eerie coincidences. Or you know, it's just really silly stuff.Walter Sparrow is a dog catcher who comes across a book his wife found called ""the Number 23"". The wife doesn't seem too interested but when he starts reading, he starts to get drawn into the story of detective Fingerling, who is becoming increasingly obsessed with the frequent occurences of the number 23 in dates, names and color shades. Interestingly, many of the things written in the book match Walter's life and with the help of his wife Agatha and son Robin, he tries to figure out the mystery of the number.The film's goal is to make you afraid of strange coincidences and recurring appearances of the number 23. So right there you have to wonder ""can a number really freak me out?"" Well, probably not since it's played with deadpan seriousness that you almost can imagine actors flubbing their lines because of how silly it sounds. One scene involving a dog and Walter's decision to ""take care of the problem"" is so hilarious, it's hard to take the film seriously. Not to mention the frequent decodings of everything equalling 23 is kind of absurd and if you were to play the drinking game, you'd probably never put your bottle down. Granted, Schumacher on occasion can create interesting visuals, such as a long shot involving Fingerling's younger years or a rotating camera around a room that's magically filling up with scribblings, but it's all for naught as the story itself is so bad that the visuals merely feel like the best thing going rather than enhancing anything.Acting-wise, we're pretty much in the same ballpark. Proving himself as a dramatic actor already with the Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, here he seems to be trying a bit too hard where he gets super excited about anything involving the number or he says things in a really hushed tone. Only one I really liked was Virginia Madsen even though her character does rather dumb things. No woman I know would follow her husband that far since they'd probably just turn the guy in and deal with it all with her husband behind bars.The Number 23 is one of those films released on DVD that you'd probably rent simply because you can't think of anything else to watch. It's an okay watch but if you have doubts about whether this is a good film or not, it's usually best to trust your instincts.",2,And they said math wouldn't hurt anybody,1185926400,"08 1, 2007",2007,2810,"['Joel', 'Schumacher', 'always', 'been', 'kind', 'filmmaker', 'love', 'bash', 'just', 'so', 'easy', 'Sure', 'now', 'then', 'something', 'surprising', 'such', 'Tigerland', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'large', 'always', 'been', 'extremely', 'unreliable', 'making', 'good', 'movies', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'debacle', 'was', 'Batman', 'films', 'did', 'Now', 'sights', 'idea', 'patterns', 'numbers', 'hold', 'mystical', 'significance', ""'re"", 'surrounded', 'eerie', 'coincidences', 'know', 'just', 'really', 'silly', 'stuff.Walter', 'Sparrow', 'dog', 'catcher', 'who', 'book', 'wife', 'found', 'called', 'Number', '23', 'wife', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'interested', 'when', 'reading', 'get', 'drawn', 'story', 'detective', 'Fingerling', 'who', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'obsessed', 'frequent', 'occurences', 'number', '23', 'dates', 'names', 'color', 'shades', 'Interestingly', 'many', 'things', 'written', 'book', 'match', 'Walter', 'life', 'help', 'wife', 'Agatha', 'son', 'Robin', 'figure', 'out', 'mystery', 'number.The', 'film', 'goal', 'make', 'afraid', 'strange', 'coincidences', 'recurring', 'appearances', 'number', '23', 'So', 'right', 'have', 'wonder', 'can', 'number', 'really', 'freak', 'out', 'Well', 'probably', 'not', 'played', 'deadpan', 'seriousness', 'almost', 'can', 'imagine', 'actors', 'flubbing', 'lines', 'how', 'silly', 'One', 'scene', 'involving', 'dog', 'Walter', 'decision', 'take', 'care', 'problem', 'so', 'hilarious', 'hard', 'take', 'film', 'seriously', 'Not', 'mention', 'frequent', 'decodings', 'everything', 'equalling', '23', 'kind', 'absurd', 'were', 'play', 'drinking', 'game', ""'d"", 'probably', 'never', 'put', 'bottle', 'down', 'Granted', 'Schumacher', 'occasion', 'can', 'create', 'interesting', 'visuals', 'such', 'long', 'shot', 'involving', 'Fingerling', 'younger', 'years', 'rotating', 'camera', 'room', 'magically', 'filling', 'up', 'scribblings', 'naught', 'story', 'so', 'bad', 'visuals', 'merely', 'feel', 'best', 'thing', 'going', 'rather', 'enhancing', 'anything.Acting-wise', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'ballpark', 'Proving', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'already', 'Truman', 'Show', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'here', 'be', 'trying', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'where', 'super', 'excited', 'anything', 'involving', 'number', 'things', 'really', 'hushed', 'tone', 'Only', 'one', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'even', 'character', 'rather', 'dumb', 'things', 'woman', 'know', 'would', 'follow', 'husband', 'far', ""'d"", 'probably', 'just', 'turn', 'guy', 'deal', 'husband', 'bars.The', 'Number', '23', 'one', 'films', 'released', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'probably', 'rent', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'else', 'watch', 'okay', 'watch', 'have', 'doubts', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'usually', 'best', 'trust', 'instincts']",N/A

I agree with most reviews that telling the story took longer than needed, and perhaps, it may have been more confusing than it needn't be, but if you went for the ride, the ending brought everything together like zipping up an overstuffed duffle bag. I really enjoyed Jim Carrey's perfomance as he doesn't get many opportunities to expand his portfolio beyond so much in the way of silly comedy (which I also enjoy immensely). As he - and his audience - mature, I believe he will be using his talents more in a dramatic means to explore his skill as an actor. Though ""23"" isn't the one to put him on top, it can certainly be perceived as a worthy stepping stone. Give it a chance.

The story makes no sense, and it is nothing like the previews indicate. Absolutely absurd, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I wish I could say something positive, but I can't. The movie is so dark and dreary it is actually hard to see, not just difficult to watch. Characters are introduced randomly that have seemingly nothing to do with the plot, and why Virginia Madsen is still making big screen movies I'll never know. Wasn't she the one from the original Candyman movie? I guess she made some kind of comeback in an indie film a few years ago, but she is terribly vapid in this movie. Carrey is all over the place, with the facial expressions of the Cable Guy, set on the backdrop of ""the Grudge.""

1067213,A1YXGVAKHLCL26,B000OYC7BW,CryWolf854,"[1, 1]","Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey; The Majestic, Man On the Moon) lived a very ordinary life with his wife Aggie (sexy Virginia Madsen; Sideways, A Haunting In Connecticut) and son Robbie. That all changes when Aggie buys him a book called The Number 23 about the screwed up detective Fingerly (Carrey again in a very surprising reverse role) and his descent into madness all because of this number. Soon, Walter is seeing 23s everywhere; in his birthdate, his wedding anniversary, even in the color paint Aggie chooses for the living room. And, before long, he begins to believe that he is Detective Fingerly and that book is about him. Is he really the murderous psychopath detailed in the only novel written by Topsy Kretts or is he just paranoid and reaching for every possible avenue that leads to 23? In the end, the truth will find him.Now, admittedly, I didn't think I would be interested in a scary math movie. After all, math was my worse subject. But I had been given a free coupon to a screening and the trailer did perk my interest. Plus, with a babe like Virgina Madsen, there would be plenty of eye candy to go around (especially once she leaves the role of Aggie and becomes Fingerly's equally dark mistress Fabritzia.). So I said what the hell. Needless to say, I liked what I saw.Jim Carrey has never really been a favorite actor of mine. But this time he was finally able to show his range. His distinction between the dual roles of Sparrow and Fingerly is so decisive that it almost comes off as if two different actors are doing the role. Same with Virginia Madsen. Normally cast in good girl roles, it was refreshing to see her take on a rather sinister character for a change. While there are huge leaps in the believability in the movie, there are in fact people out there that sees the whole enigma behind the number 23 as real and legit. I, personally, don't get it but the movie was still enjoyable enough that I have seen it on multiple occasions now which is something I rarely do with movies now.The blu-ray comes with both the rated and unrated cuts of the film with the only real noticeable differences between the two being some extended shots of the two or three sex scenes. The audio is Dolby DTS 6.1. The picture is anamorphic 2.4:1 and 1080 p. with nice sharp colors and rich blacks without being too dark and overbearing that you can't see anything (unlike AVP: Requiem.).Overall, it's not as bad as everyone seems to like to slam it for being. The critics hated it and it didnt win any awards but I'm still going to recommend it. Now the only thing really scary about this movie other than Jim Carrey's hairstyle is that ugly color red Aggie chooses for their living room. Wtf was she thinking? I guess the number found her as well.",4,Who Knew Math Could Be Such A Killer Subject?,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,2764,"['Walter', 'Sparrow', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Majestic', 'Man', 'Moon', 'lived', 'very', 'ordinary', 'life', 'wife', 'Aggie', 'sexy', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'Sideways', 'A', 'Haunting', 'Connecticut', 'son', 'Robbie', 'changes', 'when', 'Aggie', 'book', 'called', 'Number', '23', 'screwed', 'up', 'detective', 'Fingerly', 'Carrey', 'again', 'very', 'surprising', 'reverse', 'role', 'descent', 'madness', 'number', 'Soon', 'Walter', 'seeing', '23s', 'everywhere', 'birthdate', 'wedding', 'anniversary', 'even', 'color', 'paint', 'Aggie', 'living', 'room', 'long', 'believe', 'Detective', 'Fingerly', 'book', 'really', 'murderous', 'psychopath', 'detailed', 'only', 'novel', 'written', 'Topsy', 'Kretts', 'just', 'paranoid', 'reaching', 'possible', 'avenue', '23', 'end', 'truth', 'will', 'find', 'him.Now', 'admittedly', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'scary', 'math', 'movie', 'math', 'was', 'worse', 'subject', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'free', 'coupon', 'screening', 'trailer', 'did', 'perk', 'interest', 'babe', 'Virgina', 'Madsen', 'would', 'be', 'plenty', 'eye', 'candy', 'go', 'around', 'especially', 'once', 'role', 'Aggie', 'Fingerly', 'equally', 'dark', 'mistress', 'Fabritzia.', 'said', 'what', 'hell', 'Needless', 'say', 'liked', 'what', 'saw.Jim', 'Carrey', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'favorite', 'actor', 'mine', 'time', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'show', 'range', 'distinction', 'dual', 'roles', 'Sparrow', 'Fingerly', 'so', 'decisive', 'almost', 'off', 'two', 'different', 'actors', 'are', 'doing', 'role', 'Same', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'Normally', 'cast', 'good', 'girl', 'roles', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'take', 'rather', 'sinister', 'character', 'change', 'are', 'huge', 'leaps', 'believability', 'movie', 'are', 'fact', 'people', 'there', 'whole', 'enigma', 'number', '23', 'real', 'legit', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'have', 'seen', 'multiple', 'occasions', 'now', 'something', 'rarely', 'do', 'movies', 'now.The', 'blu-ray', 'rated', 'unrated', 'cuts', 'film', 'only', 'real', 'noticeable', 'differences', 'two', 'being', 'extended', 'shots', 'two', 'three', 'sex', 'scenes', 'audio', 'Dolby', 'DTS', '6.1', 'picture', 'anamorphic', '2.4:1', '1080', 'p.', 'nice', 'sharp', 'colors', 'rich', 'blacks', 'being', 'too', 'dark', 'overbearing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'AVP', 'Requiem', '.Overall', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'everyone', 'like', 'slam', 'being', 'critics', 'hated', 'win', 'awards', ""'m"", 'still', 'going', 'recommend', 'Now', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'scary', 'movie', 'other', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'hairstyle', 'ugly', 'color', 'red', 'Aggie', 'chooses', 'living', 'room', 'Wtf', 'was', 'thinking', 'guess', 'number', 'found', 'as', 'well']",N/A
1067214,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B000OYC7BW,C. Sawin,"[2, 4]","Walter Sparrow lives a normal life. He seems a little bored with his job as a dog catcher, but happy nevertheless. The movie begins with him being talked into trying to catch a stray dog just minutes before he's about to get off work for the day. He's supposed to meet his wife as soon as he gets off work since it's his birthday. So everything seems to be in order until the dog bites him and he ends up running late. Meanwhile his wife works at a cake shop and is waiting for her husband to meet her there. While she's waiting for him, a book catches her eye in the store next door. The dog ends up getting away from him and he leaves empty handed. He finally arrives and is relieved to see that his wife is still there. She ends up buying the book for him as a present even though he's a little skeptical about it at first. Once he starts reading it, however, he starts becoming obsessed with the number 23 and is convinced that everything that has ever happened in his life relates to that number. Once he starts reading the book, the movie jumps back in forth between reality and the story. Once we've established we're in the story, Walter Sparrow becomes Fingerling, the detective. He thinks the book is written specifically for him and is basically a retelling of his life. He spends the rest of the film trying to figure out the mystery of who the author really is.The whole thing that drew me to this movie was Jim Carrey being in a horror movie. I probably wouldn't have been half as interested if he wasn't in it. I immediately became less enthused when I realized who Joel Schumacher was and what other movies he had directed. For those who don't know, he's the director of films like Batman Forever, Batman and Robin, and 8MM. A big deal was made about him and Jim Carrey reuniting for The Number 23. I can't really say that it was a reunion that everyone was looking forward to or one that paid off in the end.When I first saw the trailer, I was excited as hell to see this movie. I thought that it looked great and couldn't wait to see it. It was a discussion with a guy at work that really brought the idea of the movie into a new light. He was saying that it looked stupid and that it had one of the worst ideas for a movie he'd ever heard. While he was explaining it to someone else at work, I realized how ridiculous the movie really sounded. I just hadn't really thought about how it would sound out loud. Jim Carrey was really the sole purpose I wanted to see this movie. I really enjoyed his more serious roles like the ones in The Majestic and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Why would I feel any different about this film?Right away, in the first few minutes of the film, people are going to compare Jim Carrey's actions to another role. A certain pet detective. I can't really blame them, especially after he continues to tell the dog a story while he's trying to catch it. There were certain things like that in the film that made things humorous when they probably weren't meant to be. He said something along the lines of, ""I rest my case, your honor,"" that just reminded me of Liar, Liar. I couldn't help but laugh. Some of the dialogue that's exchanged in the last act of the film didn't make things much better. I think I was waiting for the point in the film for Jim Carrey to just go absolutely insane where he could go over the top and just be crazy. It never really came though. He does go crazy and he does it well, but it just wasn't what I was expecting. The other thing I wasn't happy with was the ""twist"" of the film. It made the entire film a waste of time. There were several things left unanswered, as well. Unless there's a sequel, we'll never get those answers. We can only assume.In the end, I was honestly just disappointed with the film. I had heard so many bad reviews, but didn't want to believe them. I went into this wanting to like this film, but I guess I went in with higher expectations than I originally intended. I didn't hate the film, but I didn't like it either. I really disliked the twist, but other than that the movie did have its moments.

The pace of the movie is laboriously dreary and slower than a pull out of the troops in Iraq. The story is only mildly interesting which is very misleading thanks to the trailers. I was under the impression that the frequency of times that the number 23 comes up would be intvestigated in the movie with an answer or answers as to WHY (ala Davinci Code) but instead we're subjected to a paranoid man who only sees the number 23 everywhere. Oh and yeah, murders and ridiculous amounts of sex in a book that Carrey's character is convinced has been written specifically about his life. Turns out, the number 23 isn't even important after all, since Carrey's really just playing a sicko with an affinity for killing off people obsessed with...what else... the number 23. The end scenes where we discover that Carrey's our knife wielding nutter butter are done completely over, so we see scenes already acted out in the narration scenes as Carrey was reading the book, only now it's Carrey we see instead of the book's main character acting out the killings and lunacy, so we essentially see key scenes of the same movie twice, as if watching it ONCE wasn't bad enough. They could have easily done a snippet scene montage, which is the smart way to wrap up an already long seeming, slow moving sludgefest, yet the director seems to be taking pleasure in the fact that he's the boss and you just HAVE to watch the movie his way. If this film doesn't end Jim Carrey's acting career, as well as the careers of EVERYONE involved with the making of this film, then Hollywood really is the dumbest place for movies to be made.

It all adds up (pun intended).  23 is horrible.  By the way, I know this is an annoying and pretentious way to start a review, but this review is about an annoying and pretentious movie, so I couldn't help myself.Boring, predictable and abysmal are all words that spring to mind when I try to come up with a way to sum the plot up.  This movie leans on pretty much every ""thriller"" clich&eacute; in the book (no pun intended).  The whole time I was watching it I felt like it was a direct assault on my intelligence.The character development was stunted, and there wasn't a single character in the movie that seemed believable to me.  Their dialogue seems mechanical and by the end of the movie there wasn't a single character I was rooting for.  In the ""key scenes"", or scenes where the characters were in peril, I just found myself not really caring what happened.  I think the acting was actually pretty good at times, but it wasn't enough to breathe life into the characters in the story.The pace of the movie was slow.  Painfully slow.  To give you an example, if 23 a good book, everything that happens in the movie would probably happen in the span of about one chapter.  They had no plot or secrets to unravel, so it was pretty much like the movie rambled along with no point until it hit the end where it was like ""by the way, this is what happened"".  And the only surprise in store for me at the end of the movie was how painfully obvious and uncreative the ending was.Anyway, I love thrillers, and I love the horror genre.  I can appreciate campy horror movies (the Evil Dead trilogy is my favorite, to give you an idea).  The Number 23 is horrible because it committed the cardinal sin of taking itself too seriously.

Spoiled the film for you? Too bad... It would be best for you to spend your money elsewhere instead of wasting it on this completely incoherent and half-hearted nonsense. I have to admit that I was suckered into seeing this film because the trailer looked really intriguing. The idea behind the film was mildly interesting, too, but once again Hollywood proves that it doesn't care about insulting the intelligence of its viewers. First off, Jim Carrey seriously needs to go back to making Ace Ventura movies. If they would have casted someone like Edward Norton, who can actually play dark characters ""really"" well, then this film might have not been so bad.... But, in the end, Carrey is really hard to take seriously and I spent most of the film waiting for him to say ""alrighty then"" or to start talking out of his bum. He comes across completely dimwitted and blatantly stupid on screen as a dramatic actor and watching him attempt to play a ""dark"" character was laughable at best. I know he has been trying to broaden his horizons and break into dramatic acting for well over a decade now, but with portrayals such as these it seems like he is never going to go any further than comedic roles.... Another mark against this film were the annoying pseudo-softcore sex scenes that they threw at you every ten minutes or so... Only a thirteen year old boy would find these dumb scenes arousing... Throw in a little PG-13 sadomasochism and suddenly this film is supposed to be daring and extreme? It was completely unnecessary to have 23 of these scenes (pun intended) because it really weighted the film down and made it unbelievably repetitive.The real tragedy is that this could have been a really cool film had it been tweaked here and there with a completely different cast in line....

In parts of the movie, especially the opening credits, they went through awful events of the past so quickly I couldn't keep up with the addition.

But there's often a logical explanation, if only you understand it.Even so, the movie was unnerving. Not just the ridiculous number of ""coincidences,"" but the fact that being unable to deal with those coincidences could drive a person insane. And I thought the movie was very well done. I've always been a big fan of Jim Carrey, and yes, I like him because I think he's an excellent comedian, and it's so hard to find good comedies these days. He's one of the best. But, like the actors themselves, I like to see them branch out and see what else they can do. Apparently he's an excellent dramatic actor as well!The ending was a shock. The ending also fools you, kind of changing itself a few times. And then, when we finally get to the actual final conclusion, I feel it is the correct conclusion.

I was told that Jim Carry has the same thing in this movie.Actually, he doesn't.  Yes, he has an obsession with the number 23 throughout the movie, but he was more obsessed with combination of things that pointed to 2's and 3's (the hands on a clock, sport shirts that lined up just right) and sometimes a little math that added to 23 or sometimes 32 (such as the clock reading 11:12... 11 + 12 = 13).  That last part might be more like Arithmomania.  But the only thing that was counted throughout the movie were some steps and some shoes. Anyways, I digress...As for the story, it gets a little intriguing but is pretty predictable for the most part.  No real, ""Wow, I didn't see that coming,"" types of plot twists.

Written by Topsy Kretts (I would have gone with something like Drew Peacock or Jacques Strap), it's about loose numerology, and connections between statistics that soon consume Walter's life.  Before making it through more than the first few chapters, he realizes that all the important numbers in his life, his important dates, his address, his zip code, his in-seam (just kidding), and his IQ (not kidding) can all be easily manipulated to some variation of the number 23.  Paranoia ensues.Jim Carrey's dual-performance as Walter, and Fingerling, the sociopath detective from the book causing the paranoia, is masterful.  Carrey shows his range as an actor, distancing himself from the rubber-faced contortionist act that made him a superstar.  And Virginia Madsen as a cleavage-displaying, sex-craved Fabrizia, a woman into bondage, sadomasochism, and rape fantasies is equally jaw dropping.  In fact, combining her character with the cameo by Rhona Mitra makes me wish there were a sequel.Portions of the cinematography are similarly ingenious.  There are extreme color contrasts, with blacks darker than an eclipse battling bleached alabaster whites for the viewer's focus.  The combination reminded me of aspects from Sin City.Finally, the ending is interesting but a little predictable.  If one allows themselves to delve into the story, it's quite easy to ignore the foreshadowing.  For those who enjoy pointing out how a magician does something more than enjoying the magic, you may hate the ending.As far as the actual point of the movie, well, that's pretty stupid.  Forgive me, but it just doesn't add up.  Jim Carey was born on Jan 17.  If January is the number 1, and you add it to 17, there doesn't seem to be anything mysterious going on; it's only 18.  But if you add the 5 times I rolled my eyes during the number theory explanations, wait, THAT'S 23!!  What I learned from the movie are two terms I found to describe the plot.  The first is apophenia, the experience of seeing patterns or connections in random or meaningless data.  The second is known as the Texas sharpshooter fallacy.  Basically, the idea comes from the idea of someone shooting several rounds into the broadside of a barn, and THEN painting a target in such a fashion to make it appear that the shots were on target.  In other words, the conclusions are artificial.Then again, I was born in 1976 (1+9+7+6=23)...",4,"Stats never lie, but liars use stats",1229558400,"12 18, 2008",2008,2568,"['When', 'Agatha', 'Sparrow', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'extra', 'moment', 'book', 'store', 'waiting', 'husband', 'Walter', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'up', 'book', 'number', '23', 'Written', 'Topsy', 'Kretts', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'something', 'Drew', 'Peacock', 'Jacques', 'Strap', 'loose', 'numerology', 'connections', 'statistics', 'soon', 'consume', 'Walter', 'life', 'making', 'more', 'first', 'few', 'chapters', 'important', 'numbers', 'life', 'important', 'dates', 'address', 'zip', 'code', 'in-seam', 'just', 'kidding', 'IQ', 'not', 'kidding', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'variation', 'number', '23', 'Paranoia', 'ensues.Jim', 'Carrey', 'dual-performance', 'Walter', 'Fingerling', 'sociopath', 'detective', 'book', 'causing', 'paranoia', 'masterful', 'Carrey', 'range', 'actor', 'distancing', 'rubber-faced', 'contortionist', 'act', 'made', 'superstar', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'cleavage-displaying', 'sex-craved', 'Fabrizia', 'woman', 'bondage', 'sadomasochism', 'rape', 'fantasies', 'equally', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'fact', 'combining', 'character', 'cameo', 'Rhona', 'Mitra', 'wish', 'were', 'sequel.Portions', 'cinematography', 'are', 'similarly', 'ingenious', 'are', 'extreme', 'color', 'contrasts', 'blacks', 'darker', 'eclipse', 'battling', 'bleached', 'alabaster', 'whites', 'viewer', 'focus', 'combination', 'reminded', 'aspects', 'Sin', 'City.Finally', 'ending', 'interesting', 'little', 'predictable', 'one', 'delve', 'story', 'quite', 'easy', 'ignore', 'foreshadowing', 'who', 'enjoy', 'pointing', 'out', 'how', 'magician', 'something', 'more', 'enjoying', 'magic', 'may', 'hate', 'ending.As', 'far', 'actual', 'point', 'movie', 'well', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'Forgive', 'just', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'was', 'born', 'Jan', '17', 'January', 'number', '1', 'add', '17', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'anything', 'mysterious', 'going', 'only', '18', 'add', '5', 'times', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'number', 'theory', 'explanations', 'wait', 'THAT', '23', 'What', 'learned', 'movie', 'are', 'two', 'terms', 'found', 'describe', 'plot', 'first', 'apophenia', 'experience', 'seeing', 'patterns', 'connections', 'random', 'meaningless', 'data', 'second', 'known', 'Texas', 'sharpshooter', 'fallacy', 'Basically', 'idea', 'idea', 'someone', 'shooting', 'several', 'rounds', 'broadside', 'barn', 'THEN', 'painting', 'target', 'such', 'fashion', 'make', 'appear', 'shots', 'were', 'target', 'other', 'words', 'conclusions', 'are', 'artificial.Then', 'again', 'was', 'born', '1976', '1+9+7+6=23']",N/A

It was another unfortunate case of being so bad that it couldn't be salvaged even for laughs.The story begins with dog catcher Walter Sparrow(Carrey) as he gets bit by a dog which leads him to be late from picking up his wife at her store in town. As she is waiting outside she stumbles into the bookstore next to her shop and begins to read a book titled ""The Number 23."" Once Carrey gets there she suggests that he picks up the book and read it himself. The book has a disclaimer which states if the reader has any similarities with the main character or any of the events that take place the they should no longer read the book. As Carrey starts reading he feels as if the book is about his life but chooses to read on. Sounds pretty cool right? Well it isn't. This is where the downward spiral begins and never looks back. As carrey becomes more and more obssesed with the book you will become more and more bored.This one is a real waste of time. It really has nothing to offer except an extremely predictable story in which you could, change channels, watch something else for 20 mins, then turn it back on and feel as if you never left.

However, what I found was quite different....a great idea for a movie that is simply poorly executed.I wouldn't say the film is necessarily predictable, but it certainly wasn't engaging.  Granted, I'm not much of a Jim Carrey fan, but to his credit, he has pulled off some great acting roles in ""The Truman Show"" and the aforementioned ""Spotless Mind"".  Through most of the film, Mr. Carrey's acting was simply hollow - there was no real passion.  In other parts, I felt he was over acting, perhaps to drive the plot.  At no point in the film did I buy into the story, despite having such a strong cast and director, and at no point did I feel one way or the other about any of the characters....The ending felt rushed, and was somewhat unfulfilling...basically it felt as though the movie consisted of empty calories...cheese whiz for the big screen.I'm sorry, but I wouldn't recommend this film for even a rental.",1,Thankfully I only rented it...,1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,1037,"['Having', 'missed', 'film', 'theaters', 'rented', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'However', 'what', 'found', 'was', 'quite', 'different', '.a', 'great', 'idea', 'movie', 'simply', 'poorly', 'executed.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'necessarily', 'predictable', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'engaging', 'Granted', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'fan', 'credit', 'pulled', 'off', 'great', 'acting', 'roles', 'Truman', 'Show', 'aforementioned', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'most', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Carrey', 'acting', 'was', 'simply', 'hollow', 'was', 'real', 'passion', 'other', 'parts', 'felt', 'was', 'acting', 'perhaps', 'drive', 'plot', 'point', 'film', 'did', 'buy', 'story', 'having', 'strong', 'cast', 'director', 'point', 'did', 'feel', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'characters', '.The', 'ending', 'felt', 'rushed', 'was', 'somewhat', 'unfulfilling', 'basically', 'felt', 'movie', 'consisted', 'empty', 'calories', 'cheese', 'whiz', 'big', 'screen.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'even', 'rental']",N/A

""A New Yorker""","[2, 4]","Maybe it was to be expected that Schumacher, who hasn't really made a very satisfying film since the mid 90s, would gravitate to material like this that would at least allow him some time to exercise his 'weird' directorial chops. And really, there is some potential in this as well; Carrey's dog-catcher protagonist is given a book on his birthday (which is on 2/3) called the Number 23, which deals with a sax-playing detective with a dark past who gets involved with an even darker, more sadistic woman (Virginia Madsen, who also plays the 'real-world' wife of Carrey's character, as he envisions it as he reads it anyway), and the sadism and murder and madness that ensues. If there was just a straight adaptation of the book AS the movie, or if the archetypal figures that lay in this pulpy world inspired in part by serial novels were just put forward simply without the number symbolism, it would be a much more intriguing movie. Especially because said 'imagined' scenes showing what happens in the book are shot in a perfectly abstract style, where even in the choppy edit parts there's still a vicious vision going on. These sparks indicate that there could be some talent in the writer and filmmaker.As for Carrey, he seems to be just going through his motions for what he can do as an actor (as with Madsen, up to a point), but it's not enough to stop what happens with the script, which at times seems to be going at lengths to continue that montage in Pee Wee's Big Adventure when Pee-Wee sees all the bikes going by when his is gone. Soon Carrey's ""every-man"" sees it everywhere, with numbers adding up, the combinations endless, and it all leading to what ends up being so predictable I wouldn't dare spoil it not because it's very important but just to not insult your intelligence reading this. Just let it be known that Phillips decides to take that easy-route of the main character really having to face head-on everything that he's encountered so far and then re-contemplate everything in his entire life. This, which makes up the last fifteen minutes, is excruciating in the length of the exposition, with all the answers spoon-fed to the audience so that nothing is left questioned about who this man really is or what he's done. It compounds what has already gone on with the pretentious obsessive qualities, of it being about the 'trick' instead of it being more interesting about characters (the very last scene also made me shake my head and do all but throw a pillow at the screen).""The number 23"" it's a pretty dense entry in the careers of both actor and director, which also happens to include a supporting character of a dog named Ned, Bud Cort in the thankless role, and lots of big-budget attention paid to the grungy details of what is under a happy existence to reveal the wretched skeletons in the closet (or rather under a stone in a park).

While waiting for him, Agatha buys a detective book with a novel about the mystery around the number 23 in a bookstore as a gift to Walther.

His further investigation discloses a mysterious situation that makes Walther paranoid.The dark ""The Number 23"" is a great tale of obsession, paranoid and redemption. The story and the characters are very well developed, the final twist is totally unexpected and the film has a stylish cinematography and edition, with intense use of dark colors. There are stunning sequences, like for example when the boy meets the widow dead on her bed, or the meeting of Fingerling with Suicide Blonde.

Not because the math was over my head, but because I'm continually boggled by how much energy, money, and time can go into producing films that make absolutely no sense and fail to entertain.  The first fatal flaw is that the film is really about Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) reading a book.  Before the movie itself has engaged the audience, the viewer is forced to watch Walter obsessively reading.  I couldn't help but wonder, why not just make the book the movie, and get rid of watching someone reading a book which becomes the movie?  Oh, because that would have made it impossible to shoot half the film like a ridiculous eighties music video to signal to the viewer that they are watching the book and not the movie itself.  While in the ""book"", Walter wears floor length leather jackets and broods in smoky lighting with slicked back hair while a bleach blond bimbo is murdered in her bed.  I kept expecting Rick Ocasek to pop out and start signing behind Walter, posturing in the exclusively white, black, and red movie set.  The book likewise enables the insertion of beyond gratuitous S and M sex scenes between Walter and his wife (Virginia Madsen), who is turned into a leather bound whore in the book.  While a movie about a book could have been an intellectual twist, the characters in the film are unable to utter more than the most banal comments about the book, like it was ""creative"".  Walter likewise proclaims to be against the concept of reading and putting someone else's lies and nonsense inside his head.  Can I really invest two hours watching a character that is anti- reading?The use of Carrey's comedic talents is forced, and his character comes off as one of those irritating mentally unstable people that cracks dumb jokes at anything and everything to avoid reality or truthfulness.  Virginia Madsen, the new ""it"" girl for playing everyone's bland film wife, is likewise irritating and one dimensional even when they slap a black wig on her and turn her into a sex crazed prostitute.To make matters worse, the DVD I rented forced me to watch the ""infinifilm"" version of the movie.  If (like me) you have never heard of this format - the infinifilm inserts large, blue pop ups on the screen every few minutes of the movie, with prompts to hit the return button to ""learn more about the character"" and other tidbits from the movie.  Have we become so ADHD as a culture that people no longer have the attention span to watch a movie without pop ups?

Much like ""Secret Window"" from a couple of years back.The story involves Carrey's wife (Virginia Madsen, ""Sideways"") going to a book shop and picking up a book titled ""The Number 23"" that was wrote by an author called Topsy Kretts (if you can't figure out the name just say it really fast or break it down bit by bit and it'll be obvious what it means). Carrey can't put it down, as from the first page he feels like the author is writing about his life.It turns out to be rather true as the book delves into the past of a man who grows up much like Carrey and ends up killing a woman he loves. As he reads on he starts seeing the number 23 everywhere, like Caesar was stabbed 23 times and other tragedies that all have dates that add up to 23, though most of the time in very convoluted ways. Carrey's wife, his son, and a man named Issac Hutton try to convince him that he's just paranoid, but he feels otherwise.The movie is and feels very drawn out which is sad, since it's only about 95 minutes long. Too bad it's very obvious early on what's going to happen as the performance's by Carrey and Madsen are actually pretty good, but the screenplay is sloppy, the dialogue is clunky and the whole film feels drained of life. The way the film was shot bothered me too, it didn't make the film seem surreal and it seemed to try to hide the fact that the movie was so annoying.Overall it's only good if you want to make fun of a thriller, like I said it's much like ""Secret Window"" a film that was pretty dull despite a good performance by the leading man.",1,The Number 20 zzzzzz.....

I believe certain famous musical bands have written songs about me, so instantly once I found out about this film, I paid full price, watched it ASAP & was NOT disappointed. Infact the last stanza, I wanted to cry, but my male cousin was with me. One message of this film is not to take art too seriously, as it can lead to obsession, isolation, hero worship: almost idolatry. I'm am so disappointed with the negative reviews of this film. Jim Carey's performance reminds me his role in Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind: & is a continuation of his alternative 'struggling artist' persona roles. Hmm maybe The Number 23 is based on my life, as sometimes in the 'fever' of loneliness I thought my house had hidden cameras aka Carey's The Truman Show: oh bless the synchronicity & sparks. The number symbology is on par with The Davinci Code & Pi: but is explored vividly & with resounding depth.

I was so excited about this movie because it is very differen't from most of his other movies.  The story starts out VERY slow.  You start to fall asleep right away.  Then it starts showing him as the character in the book he is reading.  This makes things very confusing.  It keeps jumping from one character to another.  Then when you find out what actually happened. (in the last 15 minutes)  It makes no sense and it leaves so many dead ends and questions that you ask yourself why you watched it all.  I have never wanted to leave during a movie but I wanted to leave after 15 or 20 minutes of this one.  The only reason I didn't it because my mother and I went to see it and I thought she liked it.

1067250,A3OP9CU8GUWI03,B000OYC7BW,"J. Ridgway ""Ridge""","[0, 0]","Jim Carrey stars in this second-rate psychological thriller about an animal control officer whose wife stumbles across a weird book that obsesses about the number 23.  He starts reading the book and obsessing himself.  The plot meanders between Carrey running around, obsessing and searching for odd clues, and snippets of a fantasy world where he dreams about being his alter ego, a private eye in the book.  The private eye guy is like him but much cooler and has a lot of sex with his flamboyant girlfriend.  Carrey eventually gets his wife and teenage son enwrapped in the obsession, which drives him to do some crazy things and all gets explained in the end after lots of turns and twists.  Overall the meat of the plot is actually slightly above average and intelligent at times, albeit twisted and strange.What I really don't like about this movie is that it is tainted with cheap sadistic thrills.  It combines sex, beautiful women, and graphic violence.  In the book's fantasy scenes (or Carrey's dreams) there's always a very pretty woman getting killed in some gruesome fashion.&lt; Spoilers > There are scenes of Carrey having sex with his girlfriend and then slashing her throat.  There is a pretty blonde found with slashed wrists.  Another one jumps out a window.  A man kills himself by cutting his own throat.  I find these scenes repugnant, because they show them so graphically.  Their usage is sadistic because they intertwine violence with images of young beautiful women. Basically they are cheap thrills thrown in to spice up the plot when it gets slow.  So the film's dependence on these scenes cheapens and degrades the movie overall for me.  These knock it down from an average movie to a two-star movie in my opinion.One thing that I DO like about the story is that Carrey's small family (wife and teenage son) supports him emotionally.  His son isn't some Hollywood cut-out sullen kid who hates his parents, but he actually works with his parents and adds to the film, particularly at the end.  But it's not enough to overcome the sadistic scenes of violence for me, which I found gratuitous.",2,Psychological Thriller about Number Obsession is Tainted with Cheap Thrills,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,2120,"['Jim', 'Carrey', 'second-rate', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'animal', 'control', 'officer', 'wife', 'weird', 'book', 'number', '23', 'reading', 'book', 'obsessing', 'plot', 'meanders', 'Carrey', 'running', 'around', 'obsessing', 'searching', 'odd', 'clues', 'snippets', 'fantasy', 'world', 'where', 'being', 'alter', 'ego', 'private', 'eye', 'book', 'private', 'eye', 'guy', 'much', 'cooler', 'lot', 'sex', 'flamboyant', 'girlfriend', 'Carrey', 'eventually', 'wife', 'teenage', 'son', 'enwrapped', 'obsession', 'do', 'crazy', 'things', 'explained', 'end', 'lots', 'turns', 'twists', 'meat', 'plot', 'actually', 'slightly', 'above', 'average', 'intelligent', 'times', 'twisted', 'strange.What', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'tainted', 'cheap', 'sadistic', 'thrills', 'sex', 'beautiful', 'women', 'graphic', 'violence', 'book', 'fantasy', 'scenes', 'Carrey', 'dreams', 'always', 'very', 'pretty', 'woman', 'getting', 'killed', 'gruesome', 'fashion.', 'lt', 'Spoilers', '>', 'are', 'scenes', 'Carrey', 'having', 'sex', 'girlfriend', 'then', 'slashing', 'throat', 'pretty', 'blonde', 'found', 'slashed', 'wrists', 'one', 'out', 'window', 'man', 'cutting', 'own', 'throat', 'find', 'scenes', 'repugnant', 'show', 'so', 'graphically', 'usage', 'sadistic', 'intertwine', 'violence', 'images', 'young', 'beautiful', 'women', 'Basically', 'are', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'thrown', 'spice', 'up', 'plot', 'when', 'slow', 'film', 'dependence', 'scenes', 'cheapens', 'movie', 'overall', 'knock', 'down', 'average', 'movie', 'two-star', 'movie', 'opinion.One', 'thing', 'DO', 'story', 'Carrey', 'small', 'family', 'wife', 'teenage', 'son', 'emotionally', 'son', ""n't"", 'Hollywood', 'cut-out', 'sullen', 'kid', 'who', 'parents', 'actually', 'parents', 'film', 'particularly', 'end', 'not', 'enough', 'overcome', 'sadistic', 'scenes', 'violence', 'found', 'gratuitous']",N/A

It deals with the never ending fascination that many people have with certain apparantly meaningful numbers.  Pi (3.14159, etc.) was another and I think superior film that dealt with the subject of obsessing over certain numbers.Jim Carrey pulled off the somewhat interesting plot which held my interest until roughly two thirds of the way through the story.  It was interesting to see him in a serious role for a change and witness his acting virtuosity.As far as I am concerned I never see the number ""23"" repeated in my own life and find the premise of the film ridiculous.  Obviously, the number that shows up constantly in life is ""13"", as in my first address was 1363 something or other, 1+3+6+3=13. Note that this type of arithmetic transaction is representative of the premise of this movie; only substitute the number ""23"".All kidding aside the film pi and a mathematician's preoccupation with that particular number was a much more interesting film.  Speaking as an engineer and a person with a certain fascination with all numbers I find the distribution of ratings from Amazon reviewers interesting with a flat, approximately equal number of ratings in each star group.

The plot had potential-- but the casting (and other factors) just looked so silly that the film didn't manage to come together. It could have been something like ""Vanilla Sky"" or ""The Matrix,"" (=an abstract exploration of some aspect of human consciousness-- in this case, the subconscious) but that direction was just never taken--unfortunate, because that would have been a great departure point.Bad points:1. Somehow, this movie just looked really silly. It was supposed to be serious, but there were these jokes put in the film at various points that just made the attempt a seriousness collapse like a house of cards.2. How believable was this film? Not very. Can you really imagine a teenager taking seriously his father's ranting about the number 23? Much less being taken into such a plot head over heels?3.

I gave it three stars because it is pretty entertaining, even though by the end of the movie it's all a big game that basically adds up to not a whole lot.The bait and switch has to do with the questionable psychology of the main character, Walter Sparrow, played by Jim Carrey. While it's true that he does things here on screen he's never done before in any of his other movies--play saxophone and have graphic sex and do some violent stuff--the upshot of all this is pretty much, OK, yeah, I get that. So?The mechanism/medium for the bait and switch is a book somebody wrote which has the same title as the movie itself. And of course our anti-hero comes into possession of the book. The chapters progress in the life of the book's main character, which Sparrow find similar to his own life.The movie is no doubt meant to be innovative and creepy at the same time and doesn't really do either--because, unfortunately, ""set-up"" is essentially being broadcast throughout the entire course of the movie; we just KNOW there's a trick that's going to happen, and sure enough, it does, and then we have the inevitable letdown because even though we KNEW there was a trick, when it actually happens, it's kind of a drag.The acting is slightly over the top, but in a movie like this, it kind of has to be, with Carrey, Virginia Madsen, and Danny Huston all partially mugging for the camera. So that makes it fun in a wacky, unintended, goofy cartoonish kind of way. We do kind of want to know what happens next because the mugging-like acting eggs us on--gee, what the heck really IS going on, anyway?Yes, there is murder, and yes, there is some kind of thing about the number 23, but neither of those are the main point, if you want to call it that.

The Hollywood rendition of ""The Number 23"" fails to connect with the mystery and resorts to mayhem, violence, and shock to derail what could have been a sly, psychological thriller.Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, William Burroughs, Aleister Crowley, Robert Anton Wilson, and many other noted, great thinkers were ensnared by the spell of this number. So have many lesser known, but equally earnest seekers of truth. Jim Carrey, in the role of Walter Sparrow, seems like a cardboard cut-out of the authentic seekers who have attempted to solve the 23 enigma.Many have been swept up in the synchronicities associated around the number 23 as it manifests unexpectedly; more than a few become obsessed. If you look for 23, it's suddenly all around, traversing time from past to present. It might be the metal numbers on a power pole in your yard, the number of the garment inspector who left a slip in your new shirt's pocket, a child's birthday, or your change from the coffee shop.It may appear simply as shorthand for referring to our current president,""W,"" the 23rd letter of the alphabet, and it is in our DNA. And the number 23 is central to the plot in the popular TV show ""Lost,"" and 23 showed in some fashion nearly every episode of ""Star Trek the Next Generation"" that I watched.This movie suggests that the number 23 has some secret control of Walter Sparrow's mind and actions, but the movie only scratches the surface, substituting violence for subtlety, stumbling over the historical perspective, and weaving out of control. The attempts to show how 23 is everywhere come across as a bit contrived at times, but do capture the mindset of those who become ensnared in obsessive thinking.Jim Carrey does take what is a quiet, internalized obsession for most star-crossed 23 conspirators and turn it into an external manifestation of fear, confusion, and madness. It's fun to watch his reactions to the web of 23s ensnaring him and to work out the codes that yield 23s as his character does the same.The movie, though, is a glorious mess of confusing plot strands, flashbacks, and twists, and provides scant understanding into why the characters choose one course of action or into what motivates most of the supporting cast to be part of the storyline.Visually, the tone and sets work with the theme--better than a convoluted plot that hints at the mystery of 23 without even suggesting what is at the heart of the 23 enigma.It's too bad that those who brought this concept to the silver screen did not do a better job at conveying the story of this number, but perhaps they were all puppets of a greater force. In other words, a documentary would have been much more engaging than this flawed fictional portrayal about the 23 enigma.",2,Failed attempt to capture the subtle aspects of a great mystery,1172188800,"02 23, 2007",2007,2871,"['number', '23', 'lowercased', 'do', 'not', 'mean', 'movie', 'yet', 'long-standing', 'tradition', 'mystery', 'mayhem', 'associated', 'Hollywood', 'rendition', 'Number', '23', 'fails', 'connect', 'mystery', 'resorts', 'mayhem', 'violence', 'shock', 'derail', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'sly', 'psychological', 'thriller.Sigmund', 'Freud', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'William', 'Burroughs', 'Aleister', 'Crowley', 'Robert', 'Anton', 'Wilson', 'many', 'other', 'noted', 'great', 'thinkers', 'were', 'ensnared', 'spell', 'number', 'So', 'have', 'many', 'lesser', 'known', 'equally', 'earnest', 'seekers', 'truth', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'role', 'Walter', 'Sparrow', 'cardboard', 'cut-out', 'authentic', 'seekers', 'who', 'have', 'attempted', 'solve', '23', 'enigma.Many', 'have', 'been', 'swept', 'up', 'synchronicities', 'associated', 'number', '23', 'unexpectedly', 'more', 'few', 'become', 'obsessed', 'look', '23', 'suddenly', 'around', 'traversing', 'time', 'past', 'present', 'might', 'be', 'metal', 'numbers', 'power', 'pole', 'yard', 'number', 'garment', 'inspector', 'who', 'left', 'slip', 'new', 'shirt', 'pocket', 'child', 'birthday', 'change', 'coffee', 'shop.It', 'may', 'appear', 'simply', 'shorthand', 'referring', 'current', 'president', 'W', '23rd', 'letter', 'alphabet', 'DNA', 'number', '23', 'central', 'plot', 'popular', 'TV', 'show', 'Lost', '23', 'showed', 'fashion', 'nearly', 'episode', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'watched.This', 'movie', 'number', '23', 'secret', 'control', 'Walter', 'Sparrow', 'mind', 'actions', 'movie', 'only', 'surface', 'substituting', 'violence', 'subtlety', 'stumbling', 'historical', 'perspective', 'weaving', 'control', 'attempts', 'show', 'how', '23', 'everywhere', 'come', 'bit', 'contrived', 'times', 'do', 'capture', 'mindset', 'who', 'become', 'ensnared', 'obsessive', 'thinking.Jim', 'Carrey', 'take', 'what', 'quiet', 'internalized', 'obsession', 'most', 'star-crossed', '23', 'conspirators', 'turn', 'external', 'manifestation', 'fear', 'confusion', 'madness', 'fun', 'watch', 'reactions', 'web', '23s', 'ensnaring', 'work', 'out', 'codes', 'yield', '23s', 'character', 'same.The', 'movie', 'glorious', 'mess', 'confusing', 'plot', 'strands', 'flashbacks', 'twists', 'scant', 'understanding', 'why', 'characters', 'choose', 'one', 'course', 'action', 'what', 'most', 'supporting', 'cast', 'be', 'part', 'storyline.Visually', 'tone', 'sets', 'work', 'theme', 'better', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'hints', 'mystery', '23', 'even', 'suggesting', 'what', 'heart', '23', 'enigma.It', 'too', 'bad', 'who', 'brought', 'concept', 'silver', 'screen', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'conveying', 'story', 'number', 'perhaps', 'were', 'puppets', 'greater', 'force', 'other', 'words', 'documentary', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'engaging', 'flawed', 'fictional', 'portrayal', '23', 'enigma']",N/A

Yes, he's done it before, in a movie that was falsely billed as a comedy and was instead far more disturbing than funny. I'm referring to THE CABLE GUY, a movie that I'm sure director Joel Schumacher saw before casting Jim Carrey in this dark bloodstone of a thriller.THE NUMBER 23 is suspenseful, taut, well-shot, and periodically flawed. The premise concerns a family man, an ordinary dogcatcher (the first scene, where he corners an angry pup outside a Chinese restaurant, is very traditionally funny Carrey), who finds his destiny wrapped up in a book, an old murder, and a number that seems to turn up in various forms in every aspect of his life. Carrey actually plays two roles; the second is the fictitious (?) character from the book he's reading in real life. In these alternative reality segments, shot in selective color (think SIN CITY), his character is pure id, his destiny splashed in blood and death, his hands dirty with violence, sex, and guilt. Virginia Madsen, who plays the real-life wife, is also his alternative, dark, sex fantasy. As the real life characters and the fictitious ones begin to merge, the secrets of 23 roll out like a long, blood red carpet.Jim Carrey playing an obsessive personality is no stretch. He's done it in most of his movies, whether playing a pet detective, boy-in-a-media-bubble, cable guy, or dogcatcher.

It is the story of a dog-catcher named Walter (Jim Carrey) who is given an odd book on his 32nd birthday.  Obscure and self-published, the book (which shares its title with the movie) is the noir-ish confessional of a detective named Fingerling.  Walter, as he reads, finds he is drawn into and tormented by Fingerling's world, specifically his obssession with the number 23.To illustrate my feelings on this film, I've written this brief personal dialogue I had with myself after leaving the theatre.[M.E. 1] - I really enjoyed that.  Some of the best dramatic work by Carrey since ""Spotless Mind.""  The cinematography was absorbing, too, especially during the book sequences.[M.E. 2] - Are you serious?  I thought the thing dragged.  Walter took forever to finish reading that book.  It's like 100 pages, and it took him a week to get through it!  And who could make sense of that last act?[1] - Well ... it made sense to me.  Okay, so there are implausibilities and holes that kinda killed the tension during the Big Reveal --[2] - Kinda?  First of all, Sparrow's wife is not just poorly acted, she's a confusing character.  And a huge chunk of Carrey's own performance is based on soggy dramatics.[1] - Well, Agatha's actions at the end did seem odd for a woman in her situation, but that's dismissable.  And I think the nature of the story warranted Carrey's performance.  The makers of the movie attempted nothing more than a little creepiness, a little mystery, and a lot of atmospheric dread, and they pulled it off.[2] - Well, it's suicide to hinge your movie's ambience on the creepiness of a number, I think.  The story ended up ringing false, and worse, silly.[1] - But remember the line about time being a way of attaching meaning to numbers?  The dread isn't in the digits themselves; it is ultimately in the act of attachment.  Numbers aren't scary; obsession is.[2] - I'll grant you that.  I just think it's sad that the filmmakers forgot to make the conclusion as compelling as the climax.[1] - So ... I liked it; you didn't.

Where can you go wrong? Very wrong it seems. Even Jimmy Boy can't save this film.The film started well, but started failing towards the middle, and then really failed towards the end. For the last 20 minutes or so of the film, I was thinking ""How much longer?"" There's too many ideas crammed into one film, and Joel Schumacher is desperately trying to bring it all together for the finale. No. Not going to happen. And then there was the fact there was a tall guy sitting right in front of me, whose head seemed to be jigging about at the bottom of the screen and distracting me. Now, I'm short. I make up for it by wearing 4-inch heels. Yes, I can't walk too well or too fast. But if you're gonna annoy me during an already annoying film, do expect a very painful kick.It's quite an unsettling film, but it's just way too many ideas. The Fingerling sequences, with Jim playing the tattooed character of the book The Number 23, were pointless to the rest of the film, and the tattoos were never explained. The finale seems to forget what happened in the previous hour or so, and go for a very 'generic' mystery idea. Which failed. Miserably. The Number 23 is described as a 'psychological thriller', but you cannot let the film fall flat on its face with a unsatisfactory ending. It's like a sneeze that never happens. There's all that build up, and then nothing. As some reviewers have said, they left the film 23 minutes into the film (what, did you have your stopwatch out? And did you wait for it to be 23 minutes and 23 seconds too?), and if you do watch the film and hate it, you'll be like my boyfriend, who left without much warning as soon as the credits gave a hint that they were about to roll. If the ending could have been better ... It will be interesting to see if there's an alternate ending on the DVD.Can Jim pull off a serious film? Yes, now he's older he's pulling away more & more from the comedies that have made him famous, and is trying to be a 'credible' actor. Uh huh. Bill Murray may have pulled it off, but he's gone into the ""old man not knowing what to do with his life, with lots of sarcasm"" roles. If Jim's hoping to make the same leap, I think he's best rethinking it, and sacking his agent.And the dog? What was the deal with the dog? It was a perfectly nice looking dog, but I don't think it was worth ruining his reputation amongst the other acting dogs (hey, do you know the dog from Men In Black? Can you give him my number?) Dogs cannot read gravestones. There was a doggy treat just being held out of shot.A full length feature film about a single number is a bit excessive, no matter how many times Jim appears topless. What Jim needs to do is do something funny. Very funny. Don't cut the hair. (I like the longish hair. That does not mean you grow your hair boy!) Get yourself a new agent. Maybe get your current squeeze, Jenny McCarthy, to appear alongside you, since she's not so bad with the comedy either. And get us rolling in the aisles again.

THE NUMBER 23 was skewered by some incredibly short sighted critics, who mercilessly laid waste to the film, and it ended up only racking in some $35 million in it's theatrical run.Granted, after the witnessing the corpse that was BATMAN AND ROBIN, having Joel Schumacher as your director probably won't do much to inspire and sort of positive reaction, but THE NUMBER 23 is actually an indication that Schumacher is back in the business of making movies that can be taken seriously.Dogcatcher Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey), whose name begins and ends with the 23rd letter of the alphabet, receives and interesting gift for his birthday: a book called ""The Number 23: A novel of Obsession"" by Topsy Kretts. It revolves around borderline psychotic Detective Fingerling (also Jim Carrey) receiving what seems to be some kind of numerical obsession curse from a blonde suicide, who kills herself when her obsession with the number 23 becomes to much.Walter soon realizes that a significant portion of the events in the book correspond to his own life...and begins to fear that he is destined to follow Fingerling's fate of becoming a killer. Walter's wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen) dismisses the whole thing as sheer coincidence, but before long, Walter realizes that the events of the book also mirror an actual murder,and realizes that book is in fact, a masked confession by the murderer. As he becomes determined to discover who wrote the sel-fpublished and self-printed book, his quest eventually leads him to discover the dark secret of the author's true identity.THE NUMBER 23 is one of the most underrated movies I have ever seen.

Yeah, the promise for The Number 23 wasn't very high from the start, but giving it the benefit of the doubt, I gave it a look.  Needless to say, my suspiscions of the film were right.  Carrey plays a family man given a book dealing with a man obsessed with the number 23 and all the strange occurences revolved around it.  Soon enough he finds himself embroiled in the book's plot as his life starts to imitate the art.  Without giving away a few of the twists peppered throughout the film, it goes without saying that The Number 23 is pure mainstream melodrama at it's near worst.  The acting is overwrought, and Carrey himself just isn't believable in the main role.  He doesn't even come off as creepy in what should be the film's creepiest moments, which nearly kills the film by itself.  Add to that wasted roles for Virginia Madsen and Danny Huston, and you get the end result.  There are some interesting moments to be found here though, and Schumacher doesn't do too bad a job as what we've come to expect from him over the years, but the overall result is a dud.

But, I saw that it was hated by a LOT of people and almost didn't buy it, but different opinions are a great thing in this old world we live in, and it's neat when we can so honestly be divided in half on some, like this film.Jim Carrey is right at home in this role, especially as the detective. I will stand by my opinion, especially that it was one of Carey's BEST performances ever. I prefer him in more serious roles like that, unlike the godawful painful stupid comedies like ""Dumb And Dumber"" and ""Me, Myself, And Irene"" (I actually wanted to swat myself in the crotch with a sledgehammer to end the suffering those films brought on!). ""Liar Liar"" and ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" were 'cute' and funny.No, this isn't one of Carey's dumbed down piece of crap ""comedies""! If that was what most people were expecting, then no wonder they were disappointed. But for people who were expecting a more intense, intellectual film with Carey in it, then this was a real treat!And, Virginia Madsen as his wife AND Fabrizia...Wow! Just simply WOW!!As for director Joel Schumacher, he's only directed 2 to 3 (ooh, 23, ooh!) films that I truly love: ""Phantom of the Opera"" and this one. Sorry, I hated ""The Lost Boys"". There, I said it, now get over it and move on. I didn't like ""Flatliners"" either. As a matter of fact, during the 80's and 90's, I was very leery of even seeing his name attached to a film. But he sure struck gold here, in my humble opinion!By the way, I thought parts of this looked a lot like what Tarantino ought to be doing (instead some of his recent trainwrecks), especially the ultra hip scenes with Detective Fingerling (especially when Fabrizia is introduced...WOW!!!). Again, I am baffled that so many people didn't like this. It was SO hip, so NOIR, and a really cool mystery.Even though I had read every low-star rating of the film and knew the 'mystery' before I watched it (you know how these reviewers are great at giving away too many spoilers), I still found myself suspecting other characters, like the psychiatrist, the wife, et al.And for those who felt like there were maybe some ""lose ends"", the reason the film doesn't explore Carey's fascination with 23 is explained in the end (when it's revealed the book was written by...), and I never felt like anything made anything else in the film a 'joke'.People really should give it a second chance! I'm realizing that there were a LOT of films over the past recent years that I didn't like on a 1st viewing. ""The Ring"" comes to mind. But, after a second viewing, I loved it. Usually it's the other way around with me: If I don't like it on a 1st viewing, then I'm not gonna ever like it; or if I love it the 1st time, then, well, ya get the picture.Oh, the scenes with the dog all thru the film made me think of Spike Lee's ""Summer of Sam"", so that made me like it even more. What a GREAT film noir film! I am SO glad I bought it, because not only is the film awesome, but it has some great bonus material about numerology on it that I found real intriguing.

In fact, the story started out with pretty good potential.

But whenever he hooks up with hack director Joel Schumacher ('Batman Forever'), disaster strikes. 'Number 23' (also starring the talented Virginia Madsen, and she is almost wasted here) is such a terribly botched thriller, I wonder if people will ever want to place their bets on another Jim Carrey drama? Memories of Christopher Nolan's fine 'Memento' come to mind when watching 'Number 23', but Schumacher's clumsy attempt at style here comes crashing to earth with a thud. A little of that Carrey good humor does enter into the movie in the first five minutes when, as a dog catcher, he tries to nab a dog named Ned (oh, let's see, 'N' is the 14th letter in the alphabet, 'E' is the 5th letter, and 'D' is the 4th letter - oh my, that equals '23'). Throughout the movie, for some reason, all Carrey can see is the number 23 or 23 as a combination or 23 backwards, etc. (you get the picture) after reading this grungy book that his wife (Madsen) for some reason purchases for him. Then he starts to go insane. And then we discover something about a murder, and that Carrey, or maybe Ned (the dog) had something to do with. Of course number 23 has the spotlight in this drivel, but a number will only keep an audience's attention so long before they start to walk out of the theatre (which seven did, on opening night). Of course the other 16 members of the audience (hey, that equals 23 too) decided to stay to the end. Believe me. I respect Carrey's choice to go outside of his usual comedy schtick, but Joel Schumacher is not the director to make that choice with. ""Number 23"" was revolting to watch. It wasn't thrilling. It wasn't interesting. It wasn't watchable. I will keep going to see Madsen and Carrey work in other films, but please don't waste your time on this mess.

Jim Carrey starring in what seemed like a spooky, supernatural thriller--this makes for a neat twist, at last a more serious character for the brillant comic to move into and demonstrate his range as an actor. I greatly admire his talent and feel that it is well within his capability to succeed in a serious role, in a vehicle such as this, but in this film it surely is not to be the role that we know he can do. It is an overly self-conscious arty flick, and hardly coherent, despite the understanding that the Carrey character is experiencing some sort of a breakdown evidently, and the viewer is supposed to be taken along to share the experience of his psychosis.The ""story"" certainly breaks down early enough. Oh to have a dollar for every film that seems promising for a good scare and suspense, but one experiences neither in the garbled mess. Actually it's premise is worthy of a Stephen King tale--would that King could have done something with it... So Carrey can't necessarily be blamed for failing to ""Carrey"" this lame film. And the graphic sexual scenes contributed nothing meaningful to the film, some of which were unintentionally comical.The extras on the DVD might be considered the most interesting part.

1067292,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B000OYC7BW,Shashank Tripathi,"[11, 19]","I love Jim Carrey. He's the most versatile and gifted actor since Robin Williams. And I have enjoyed his forays into serious cinema such as Eternal Sunshine and Man on the Moon. But this first creepy and then idiotic caper ends up nowhere, and fast. Pink ties and mysterious biting dogs play a crucial role. Need I say more?It fancies itself a thrilling exploration of paranoia. The plot draws you in with its narrative style at first -- the film has to unfold at the pace with which Carrey's character reads a mysterious book he has received as a birthday present. Sadly, he's a slow reader.A somewhat similar but less sinister theme was recently seen in ""Stranger Than Fiction"", with another funnyman Will Ferrell finding a novel (being written contemporaneously) do the doozy on his psyche. I think that was in general a lot more successful, more thrilling, wittier.Number 23 on the other hand opts for a flawed sense of numerology as the conduit to its ""24"" like puerile thrills. Come on, even the most greenhorn numerology student will tell you that you cannot conveniently sum 14+9 and call it 23. A 14+9 is solved as 5+9, which adds up to 14, which is boiled down to 5. Not to 23.This addiction to 23, a kind of ""discordianism"", is well known and widely disregarded. Remember those post-911 chain mails that really reached to find oh-so-clever patterns in the number 911 and all that went with it? There's a lot one can find with such pattern-scouring obsessions if you care enough to google.But specious arithmetic is not the only thing going against this forgettable excuse for a film. It packs in several themes: occult, murder in a very black-and-white comic book style, and more gratuitous eroticism than seemed essential to me.

Walter Sparrow's obsession that all things are directly connected to the number 23. The movie is a combo Mystery/Suspense/Thriller that does a pretty good job of keeping the viewer interested with the Mystery part, but falls mostly short in the Suspense and Thriller departments.Joel Schumacher directs The Number 23, and shows that he has a dark side. It's too bad he didn't show his dark side when he took over the reigns of Tim Burton's Batman moviesBatman: The Motion Picture Anthology 1989-1997 (Batman / Batman Returns / Batman Forever / Batman & Robin) (Two-Disc Special Editions). Schumacher took the dark out of what Burton created and inserted the TV series camp into Batman Forever and really laid the goofy shtick on thick in Batman & Robin.Schumacher does a fair job with The Number 23. As expected, some of Carrey's situations are a bit over the top, and Schumacher tries to create a graphic novel-esque presentation during Sparrow's alter-ego episodes. But it's the completely unfathomable coincidences in the whole story that occur and keep occurring that really make you stretch to give The Number 23 any credibility for being a realistic movie.The Number 23 was effective at creating a creepy atmosphere and projecting the sense of obsession that so affected Walter Sparrow. Kudos to Jim Carrey for really getting into character (as he usually does in every role you see him in) to make the movie that much better.Overall, The Number 23 might be good if you've got nothing more compelling in this summer's slow DVD release queue.

Sue me for $23. And then double it, because although I will admit it's a bit flaccid upon second view, I still dug this semi-lurid Joel Schumacher / Jim Carrey fright flick (who, incidentally, worked together for the first time in 1994... 1+9+9+4 = 23) enough to recommend the DVD for anyone who likes conspiracy-driven psychological puzzlers.Carrey, also a producer (who named his production co. JC23 before signing on for this movie), plays Det. Fingerling a highly-sexed, risk-taking, boldly tattooed P.I. existing in a dark, deadly noir world where the women are fast and death comes even faster. His alter-ego -- or is it the other way around? -- is a quiet, gentle family man named Walter Sparrow (also Carrey), who finds himself straddling two worlds, each adding up to the number 23. As Fingerling and Walter try to solve the mystery of the noxious number, its inscrutability only deepens.Although there is only one disk, it's stuffed to its silver gills with additional release material. First of all, it's ""Infinifilm"" -- not sure what that is, but is sounds very impressive. (It basically means you can either watch the movie straight, or you can choose to veer off onto side roads of trivia and featurettes whenever you get the option to click away; once you've seen the extra bit, the movie resumes from where you left off.) The disk contains the theatrical release version of the movie, and a slightly sexier unrated version (the unrated version, for whatever reason, does not include  captions for the hearing-impaired).Needless to say, there are 23 scene selections. There are also 16 deleted scenes, plus an alternate ending. As far as additional release material goes, first up there's a basic making-of offering. Yet, it's more engaging than most, as it goes into the back story of the number 23 (first-time screenwriter Fernley Phillips based his story on the writings of Robert Anton Wilson... hm. My last name is Wilson, and I was born on the 23rd of the month...). It also reveals how and where the numbers are hidden (and overtly displayed) in the movie, has interviews with the stars and filmmakers, and behind the scenes footage.Another featurette is entitled Creating the World of Fingerling, and it begins with an overlong storyboard montage, then a look at some green screen footage, before finally delving into the goodies, which mostly concentrate on the cinematography (by Matthew Libatique, who also did Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain - not to mention two films previously for Schumacher). The filmmakers talk about the color palette, lighting design, and the joining of disparate worlds (i.e., the white-on-white of the Suicide Blonde's apartment to the cozy reds and russets of the Sparrow home). It does an eye-opening job of illustrating just how much most audiences take for granted when we watch a movie.There are two other featurettes which are more about the central riddle, and numerology (The Number 23 Enigma, and How to Find Your Life Path Number), plus an enthusiastic solo commentary by Schumacher. He has a gift of gab, which is welcome -- it not only feels like he talking to ""you"", but for those in search of real info, he imparts it: everything from who did the cool title sequence (Imaginary Forces) to the name of the canine actor (Butch). He also has a great memory for names and good enunciation (much appreciated, when one listens to as many DVD commentaries as I do).",3,23 is the new 666,1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,3529,"['OK', 'was', 'one', '23', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'liked', 'Number', '23', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'big', 'screen', 'Sue', '23', 'then', 'double', 'will', 'admit', 'bit', 'flaccid', 'second', 'view', 'still', 'dug', 'semi-lurid', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', '/', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'fright', 'flick', 'who', 'incidentally', 'worked', 'together', 'first', 'time', '1994', '1+9+9+4', '23', 'enough', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'conspiracy-driven', 'psychological', 'puzzlers.Carrey', 'also', 'producer', 'who', 'named', 'production', 'co.', 'JC23', 'signing', 'movie', 'Det', 'Fingerling', 'highly-sexed', 'risk-taking', 'boldly', 'tattooed', 'P.I', 'existing', 'dark', 'deadly', 'noir', 'world', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'fast', 'death', 'even', 'faster', 'alter-ego', 'other', 'way', 'quiet', 'gentle', 'family', 'man', 'named', 'Walter', 'Sparrow', 'also', 'Carrey', 'who', 'straddling', 'two', 'worlds', 'adding', 'up', 'number', '23', 'Fingerling', 'Walter', 'try', 'solve', 'mystery', 'noxious', 'number', 'inscrutability', 'only', 'only', 'one', 'disk', 'stuffed', 'silver', 'gills', 'additional', 'release', 'material', 'First', 'all', 'Infinifilm', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'sounds', 'very', 'impressive', 'basically', 'can', 'either', 'watch', 'movie', 'straight', 'can', 'choose', 'veer', 'off', 'side', 'roads', 'trivia', 'whenever', 'get', 'option', 'click', 'away', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'extra', 'bit', 'movie', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'disk', 'theatrical', 'release', 'version', 'movie', 'slightly', 'sexier', 'unrated', 'version', 'unrated', 'version', 'reason', 'not', 'include', 'captions', 'hearing-impaired', '.Needless', 'say', 'are', '23', 'scene', 'selections', 'are', 'also', '16', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'ending', 'As', 'far', 'additional', 'release', 'material', 'first', 'basic', 'making-of', 'offering', 'more', 'engaging', 'most', 'back', 'story', 'number', '23', 'first-time', 'screenwriter', 'Fernley', 'Phillips', 'based', 'story', 'writings', 'Robert', 'Anton', 'Wilson', 'hm', 'last', 'name', 'Wilson', 'was', 'born', '23rd', 'month', 'also', 'how', 'where', 'numbers', 'are', 'hidden', 'overtly', 'displayed', 'movie', 'interviews', 'stars', 'filmmakers', 'scenes', 'footage.Another', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Creating', 'World', 'Fingerling', 'overlong', 'storyboard', 'montage', 'then', 'look', 'green', 'screen', 'footage', 'finally', 'delving', 'goodies', 'mostly', 'concentrate', 'cinematography', 'Matthew', 'Libatique', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'Fountain', 'not', 'mention', 'two', 'films', 'previously', 'Schumacher', 'filmmakers', 'talk', 'color', 'palette', 'lighting', 'design', 'joining', 'disparate', 'worlds', 'i.e.', 'white-on-white', 'Suicide', 'Blonde', 'apartment', 'cozy', 'reds', 'russets', 'Sparrow', 'home', 'eye-opening', 'job', 'illustrating', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'most', 'audiences', 'take', 'granted', 'when', 'watch', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'featurettes', 'are', 'more', 'central', 'riddle', 'numerology', 'Number', '23', 'Enigma', 'How', 'Find', 'Your', 'Life', 'Path', 'Number', 'enthusiastic', 'solo', 'commentary', 'Schumacher', 'gift', 'gab', 'welcome', 'not', 'only', 'feels', 'talking', 'search', 'real', 'info', 'everything', 'who', 'did', 'cool', 'title', 'sequence', 'Imaginary', 'Forces', 'name', 'canine', 'actor', 'Butch', 'also', 'great', 'memory', 'names', 'good', 'enunciation', 'much', 'appreciated', 'when', 'one', 'many', 'DVD', 'commentaries', 'do']",N/A

Nevertheless they are still compelled to see it. As was I--but given the absolutely dreadful reviews ""The Number 23"" reeled in from distinguished film critics, I decided it wasn't worth my time and probably was just another lame excuse for a psychological horror film made in 2007. But today I decided, what the heck--we'll see if it's bad or good, as I paid a rough $4 at the Blockbuster counter to rent it.The Number 23 is a psychological horror film that deals with a man named Walter Sparrow (Carrey) whose wife gets him an old book entitled ""The Number 23,"" which is about a sketchy detective named Fingerling who had a life filled with tragic loss, false love, murder, and above all, an unnatural obsession with the number 23. As Walter reads the book, he notices more and more striking similarities between him and the character, and it gets to the point where the number 23 becomes his central life figure as well, and slowly he believes he is transforming into the character that he thinks is a paper replica of himself.Pretty weak storyline, eh? Yeah, I thought so too. Fortunately the film keeps itself on its feet (sort of) through skilled directing and editing, decent acting, an eerie atmosphere, a well-written screenplay, and just the sheer excitement of watching Jim Carrey in a role that is completely polar opposite of Lloyd in ""Dumb and Dumber."" Some scenes are extremely intense and shocking in a good way, ways that'll make you pull the blanket up to your chin, and eagerly await what happens next.Other times you just want to go to bed. What is unfortunate about the movie is that the bad far outweighs the good. The decently-structured film is overrun and overkilled by extremely graphic and gratuitous sex scenes (75% of which really weren't necessary), laughably over-dramatic moments, and a ridiculously clich&eacute;d, washed-up ""twist"" that you didn't see coming because it's just so absurd in the first place. Many of the ""freaky"" references to the number 23 dealing with history are also factually incorrect.Overall, it is quite obvious this film was a failed attempt at being a remembered Hitchcock-style psychological horror film and while it was an entertaining watch, I can't help but feel cheated out of that $4 I spent today.I await the next great modern psychological horror film since ""Saw.""",2,"A washed-up, wannabe psychological horror flick",1191024000,"09 29, 2007",2007,2446,"['Usually', 'when', 'one', 'film', 'very', 'first', 'initial', 'reaction', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'horror', 'movie', 'Er', 'are', 'still', 'compelled', 'see', 'was', 'given', 'absolutely', 'dreadful', 'reviews', 'Number', '23', 'reeled', 'distinguished', 'film', 'critics', 'decided', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time', 'probably', 'was', 'just', 'lame', 'excuse', 'psychological', 'horror', 'film', 'made', '2007', 'today', 'decided', 'what', 'heck', ""'ll"", 'see', 'bad', 'good', 'paid', 'rough', '4', 'Blockbuster', 'counter', 'rent', 'it.The', 'Number', '23', 'psychological', 'horror', 'film', 'deals', 'man', 'named', 'Walter', 'Sparrow', 'Carrey', 'wife', 'old', 'book', 'entitled', 'Number', '23', 'sketchy', 'detective', 'named', 'Fingerling', 'who', 'had', 'life', 'filled', 'tragic', 'loss', 'false', 'love', 'murder', 'all', 'unnatural', 'obsession', 'number', '23', 'Walter', 'book', 'more', 'more', 'striking', 'similarities', 'character', 'point', 'where', 'number', '23', 'central', 'life', 'figure', 'as', 'well', 'slowly', 'transforming', 'character', 'paper', 'replica', 'himself.Pretty', 'weak', 'storyline', 'eh', 'Yeah', 'thought', 'so', 'too', 'Fortunately', 'film', 'feet', 'sort', 'skilled', 'directing', 'editing', 'decent', 'acting', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'well-written', 'screenplay', 'just', 'sheer', 'excitement', 'watching', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'role', 'completely', 'polar', 'opposite', 'Lloyd', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'scenes', 'are', 'extremely', 'intense', 'shocking', 'good', 'way', 'ways', ""'ll"", 'make', 'pull', 'blanket', 'up', 'chin', 'eagerly', 'await', 'what', 'times', 'just', 'want', 'go', 'bed', 'What', 'unfortunate', 'movie', 'bad', 'far', 'good', 'decently-structured', 'film', 'overrun', 'overkilled', 'extremely', 'graphic', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'scenes', '75', '%', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'laughably', 'over-dramatic', 'moments', 'ridiculously', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'washed-up', 'twist', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'just', 'so', 'absurd', 'first', 'place', 'Many', 'freaky', 'references', 'number', '23', 'dealing', 'history', 'are', 'also', 'factually', 'incorrect.Overall', 'quite', 'obvious', 'film', 'was', 'failed', 'attempt', 'being', 'remembered', 'Hitchcock-style', 'psychological', 'horror', 'film', 'was', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'cheated', '4', 'spent', 'today.I', 'next', 'great', 'modern', 'psychological', 'horror', 'film', 'Saw']",N/A

His wife buys him a beat-up paperback for his birthday, and he suddenly goes crazy over the number 23...although the book is thin, it takes him forever to read. He has nightmares about murdering his wife. Why 23? Is never explained. You could just as easily go crazy over any other number...especially since he seemed to pick and choose when it was 23 and when it wasn't. 1814 is his street number, add 18 + 14 = 32 (23 reversed - oh no!)but add 18 + 1 + 4 = 23! But hey - why not do it the right way 1 + 8 + 1 + 4 = 14. Heck no, he's not gonna do that. He wants it to be 23! The problem is, NOBODY, especially the audience, CARES!The whole movie is completely silly and totally unrealistic. His family decides to send 23 huge boxes filled with styrofoam peanuts to the man they think is the author of the book (they found the PO Box at the end).

1067302,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000OYC7BW,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 3]","I'm not sure if it was the cold medicine I was on, which had numbers on the label that ironically added up together to make 23, but Joel Schumacher's latest cinematic endeavor almost won me over with its eccentric style. Too bad the story was so scatterbrained that when you calculate it all out `The Number 23' just doesn't add up.Admittedly the idea that a single number has the power to drive a man mad with its uncanny ability to almost infinitely attach itself to patterns certainly seems intriguing for a storyteller, especially a visually strong one like Schumacher. Love him or hate him for what he did to the Batman franchise, Schumacher has a knack for putting beautiful images on the big screen, and in `The Number 23' the director and `Requiem for a Dream' cinematographer Matthew Libatique put a visual exclamation point on this hauntingly beautiful descent into madness.While a director can pack as much style into a single frame as he or she wants, no matter how stunning the imagery is it still doesn't fix a flawed script, and `The Number 23' has as many plot holes as the title suggests. With `The Number 23' being screenwriter Fernley Philips' first screenplay produced into a major motion picture, one would think the writer would have put the time into tweaking the script's weaknesses, because the final product is a drawn-out mess.What are the serendipitous chances that Virginia Madsen's character just happens to pick up a book that will end up driving her husband mad? While Schumacher uses visually appealing, saturated color and basic principles of linear design to allow our sight to immediately be attracted to the novel, you still will find yourself asking why this book? When the convoluted and predictable finale hits, you too will be baffled over the slim twist of fate the `Number 23' revolves around.Perhaps the strongest selling point of `The Number 23' is for mainstream audiences to find out if Jim Carrey can handle a darker, dramatic role. While he already proved his acting chops in the pseudo romantic comedy `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', Carrey attempts to balance a unique mix between two characters, Fingerling, a film noir-like detective, and Walter Sparrow, who begins the film as your average pet detective (an inside joke perhaps?) that slowly succumbs his sanity to `The Number 23'.The most interesting parts of `The Number 23' take place within the picture's film noir sub story, which recreates the novel's account of Fingerling's murder mystery. These overexposed shots, which blast a surreal glow onto the brilliant lighting featured within each frame of Walter Sparrow's imaginative recreation of the novel, are far superior to the film's bland reality. Not only do the visuals pop off the screen, but Carrey and Madsen wrap their tongues around the hard boiled dialogue quite well, making the shoddy lines that comprise the rest of the picture all the more disappointing.While the use of style over substance in Schumacher's latest could have been forgiven had the film chosen to focus on the surreal, it is the belittling finale designed to tediously explain the plot for mass audiences that really made me cringe. I will admit, `The Number 23' had me for a while, but then the picture screeches to a halt to explain every minute detail for nearly a half an hour. Not only is it unnecessary, it is by far one of the longest debriefings ever featured in a motion picture.Though Schumacher certainly can be proclaimed as an expert stylist, his track record of misses certainly outweighs his hits. The reason is simple; Schumacher's films focus on style over substance. `The Number 23' is a prime example of this. I think even Joel Schumacher will appreciate the score this film received.-Joe Russo",3,The Number 23 Movie Review,1185062400,"07 22, 2007",2007,3764,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'cold', 'medicine', 'was', 'had', 'numbers', 'label', 'ironically', 'added', 'up', 'together', 'make', '23', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'latest', 'cinematic', 'endeavor', 'almost', 'won', 'over', 'eccentric', 'style', 'Too', 'bad', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'scatterbrained', 'when', 'calculate', 'out', 'Number', '23', 'just', ""n't"", 'add', 'up.Admittedly', 'idea', 'single', 'number', 'power', 'drive', 'man', 'mad', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'almost', 'infinitely', 'attach', 'patterns', 'certainly', 'intriguing', 'storyteller', 'especially', 'visually', 'strong', 'one', 'Schumacher', 'Love', 'hate', 'what', 'did', 'Batman', 'franchise', 'Schumacher', 'knack', 'putting', 'beautiful', 'images', 'big', 'screen', 'Number', '23', 'director', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'cinematographer', 'Matthew', 'Libatique', 'put', 'visual', 'exclamation', 'point', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'descent', 'madness.While', 'director', 'can', 'pack', 'much', 'style', 'single', 'frame', 'matter', 'how', 'stunning', 'imagery', 'still', ""n't"", 'fix', 'flawed', 'script', 'Number', '23', 'as', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'title', 'Number', '23', 'being', 'screenwriter', 'Fernley', 'Philips', 'first', 'screenplay', 'produced', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'writer', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'time', 'tweaking', 'script', 'weaknesses', 'final', 'product', 'drawn-out', 'are', 'serendipitous', 'chances', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'character', 'just', 'pick', 'up', 'book', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'driving', 'husband', 'mad', 'Schumacher', 'visually', 'appealing', 'saturated', 'color', 'basic', 'principles', 'linear', 'design', 'allow', 'sight', 'immediately', 'be', 'attracted', 'novel', 'still', 'will', 'find', 'asking', 'why', 'book', 'When', 'convoluted', 'predictable', 'finale', 'hits', 'too', 'will', 'be', 'baffled', 'slim', 'twist', 'fate', 'Number', '23', 'revolves', 'around.Perhaps', 'strongest', 'selling', 'point', 'Number', '23', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'find', 'out', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'can', 'handle', 'darker', 'dramatic', 'role', 'already', 'proved', 'acting', 'chops', 'pseudo', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'Carrey', 'balance', 'unique', 'mix', 'two', 'characters', 'Fingerling', 'film', 'noir-like', 'detective', 'Walter', 'Sparrow', 'who', 'film', 'average', 'pet', 'detective', 'inside', 'joke', 'perhaps', 'slowly', 'succumbs', 'sanity', 'Number', ""23'.The"", 'most', 'interesting', 'parts', 'Number', '23', 'take', 'place', 'picture', 'film', 'noir', 'sub', 'story', 'novel', 'account', 'Fingerling', 'murder', 'mystery', 'overexposed', 'shots', 'blast', 'surreal', 'glow', 'brilliant', 'lighting', 'featured', 'frame', 'Walter', 'Sparrow', 'imaginative', 'recreation', 'novel', 'are', 'far', 'superior', 'film', 'bland', 'reality', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'visuals', 'pop', 'screen', 'Carrey', 'Madsen', 'wrap', 'tongues', 'hard', 'boiled', 'dialogue', 'quite', 'well', 'making', 'shoddy', 'lines', 'comprise', 'rest', 'picture', 'more', 'use', 'style', 'substance', 'Schumacher', 'latest', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'forgiven', 'had', 'film', 'chosen', 'focus', 'surreal', 'belittling', 'finale', 'designed', 'tediously', 'explain', 'plot', 'mass', 'audiences', 'really', 'made', 'cringe', 'will', 'admit', 'Number', '23', 'had', 'while', 'then', 'picture', 'halt', 'explain', 'minute', 'detail', 'nearly', 'half', 'hour', 'Not', 'only', 'unnecessary', 'far', 'one', 'longest', 'debriefings', 'ever', 'featured', 'motion', 'Schumacher', 'certainly', 'can', 'be', 'proclaimed', 'expert', 'stylist', 'track', 'record', 'misses', 'certainly', 'hits', 'reason', 'simple', 'Schumacher', 'films', 'focus', 'style', 'substance', 'Number', '23', 'prime', 'example', 'think', 'even', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'will', 'appreciate', 'score', 'film', 'received.-Joe', 'Russo']",N/A
1067303,A2HN3AWEQP8V19,B000OYC7BW,"Tina Roosa ""metalhead""","[0, 1]","...considering the lead actor is Jim Carrey.  The movie centers around Walter Sparrow, a typical working joe just trying to do his job.  On his birthday, which happens to be 02/03 (get it?), he encounters a dog that's just a little.....creepy.  He gets mauled, and this makes him late.  While he's saving the world from raging beasts, his wife Agatha, played by Virginia Madsen, is browsing a used bookstore, where she encounters the  book.  She buys it for him, and the obsession begins.As Walter reads this tome, he realizes, rather uncomfortably, that his life and the life of Fingerling, the main character in the book, dovetail very neatly.  Almost too neatly.  Walter soon believes that the author wrote the book about him and for him, to warn him of the insidiousness of the number 23.  Too late, though, as the number begins to take on exaggerated significance, almost to the point of insanity.  Soon Walter begins to believe he is just like Fingerling, and starts to dream of murdering his wife the same way Fingerling killed his sexy girlfriend.  When Walter believes he's figured out who wrote the book, his son and he set out to lure the man out of hiding, so they can confront him.  Agatha goes along to keep an eye on things, and to prove to Walter that there's nothing there.  Unfortunately, Dr. Serius Leary does walk into the trap (sensitively played by Bud Cort), and during the tussle, he cuts his own throat to escape the dreaded number.  Agatha stays with Leary to try and help, and sends Walter and son home.  She's there when Leary points her in a direction almost with his last, dying breath.  She calls Walter from the hospital, where Leary died, to tell him that there was nothing to know.  Then she goes across the street to the abandoned asylum Dr. Leary told her about.  There, she finds Walter's things, including the rough draft of the book, and the detective magazines that both he and Fingerling had been obsessed with since kids.Meanwhile, Walter has figured out the code of the book.  Every 23rd word on every 23rd page is a message to him, telling him where the body is buried.  He and Robin go and dig it up.  They call cops, but Agatha and her psychiatrist friend move it before cops can get there.  Walter confronts her, believing she was the one who wrote the book.  When she shows him his things from the asylum, he begins to remember that he was the one who wrote the book, and that he had actually killed the girl whose body he had just dug up.Though I'm making this sound rather simple and bland, it really isn't.  Jim Carrey showed depth of character and feeling I really didn't think him capable.  The flashback scene where he's pacing, writing the last chapter of his book over the hotel room walls, evoked Anthony Perkins for me.  I saw Norman Bates pacing there, trying to sort out the confusion in his head.  It was a genuinely suspenseful movie, and Carrey was very believeable as a suppressed psychopath.  There's natural, unexpressed rage in him, and he really shows that to the audience.  A very well-crafted film, and a good addition to Carrey's resume.",5,I didn't expect much.....,1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,3108,"['considering', 'lead', 'actor', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'movie', 'centers', 'Walter', 'Sparrow', 'typical', 'working', 'joe', 'just', 'trying', 'do', 'job', 'birthday', 'be', '02/03', 'get', 'dog', 'just', 'little', '..creepy', 'mauled', 'late', 'saving', 'world', 'raging', 'beasts', 'wife', 'Agatha', 'played', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'browsing', 'used', 'bookstore', 'where', 'book', 'obsession', 'begins.As', 'Walter', 'tome', 'rather', 'uncomfortably', 'life', 'life', 'Fingerling', 'main', 'character', 'book', 'dovetail', 'very', 'neatly', 'Almost', 'too', 'neatly', 'Walter', 'soon', 'author', 'wrote', 'book', 'warn', 'insidiousness', 'number', '23', 'Too', 'late', 'though', 'number', 'take', 'exaggerated', 'significance', 'almost', 'point', 'insanity', 'Soon', 'Walter', 'believe', 'just', 'Fingerling', 'dream', 'murdering', 'wife', 'same', 'way', 'Fingerling', 'killed', 'sexy', 'girlfriend', 'When', 'Walter', 'figured', 'out', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', 'son', 'set', 'out', 'lure', 'man', 'hiding', 'can', 'confront', 'Agatha', 'along', 'keep', 'eye', 'things', 'prove', 'Walter', 'nothing', 'there', 'Unfortunately', 'Dr.', 'Serius', 'Leary', 'walk', 'trap', 'sensitively', 'played', 'Bud', 'Cort', 'tussle', 'own', 'throat', 'escape', 'dreaded', 'number', 'Agatha', 'Leary', 'try', 'help', 'Walter', 'son', 'home', 'there', 'when', 'Leary', 'points', 'direction', 'almost', 'last', 'dying', 'breath', 'Walter', 'hospital', 'where', 'Leary', 'died', 'tell', 'was', 'nothing', 'know', 'Then', 'street', 'abandoned', 'asylum', 'Dr.', 'Leary', 'told', 'about', 'Walter', 'things', 'including', 'rough', 'draft', 'book', 'detective', 'magazines', 'Fingerling', 'had', 'been', 'obsessed', 'kids.Meanwhile', 'Walter', 'figured', 'out', 'code', 'book', '23rd', 'word', '23rd', 'page', 'message', 'telling', 'where', 'body', 'buried', 'Robin', 'go', 'dig', 'up', 'call', 'cops', 'Agatha', 'psychiatrist', 'friend', 'move', 'cops', 'can', 'get', 'there', 'Walter', 'believing', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', 'When', 'things', 'asylum', 'remember', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', 'had', 'actually', 'killed', 'girl', 'body', 'had', 'just', 'dug', 'up.Though', ""'m"", 'making', 'sound', 'rather', 'simple', 'bland', 'really', ""n't"", 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'showed', 'depth', 'character', 'feeling', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'capable', 'flashback', 'scene', 'where', 'pacing', 'writing', 'last', 'chapter', 'book', 'hotel', 'room', 'walls', 'evoked', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'saw', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'pacing', 'there', 'trying', 'sort', 'out', 'confusion', 'head', 'was', 'genuinely', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'Carrey', 'was', 'very', 'believeable', 'suppressed', 'psychopath', 'natural', 'unexpressed', 'rage', 'really', 'audience', 'very', 'well-crafted', 'film', 'good', 'addition', 'Carrey', 'resume']",N/A

1067306,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000OYC7BW,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[25, 31]","When I saw the preview for NUMBER 23, I thought it was going to be a great film.  The concept of the number 23 being part of some global conspiracy is a great idea for a mystery thriller.  Also, Jim Carrey has done a great job of choosing roles that display the full range of his acting talents, not just ones that show his comic prowess and I was looking forward to seeing him in a mystery thriller film.  But instead of a mystery thriller, I saw a hacked up film that barely qualifies as a mystery, has no thrills, and very little suspense.Carrey portrays Walter Sparrow, and older man married to a younger woman named Agatha (Virginia Madsen) who works in a bakery.  Walter works as an animal control specialist.  Apparently Walter's job isn't all that exciting, but it is something he enjoys doing.  At the end of the work day on his birthday, he gets bitten by a stray dog.  He chases the dog until he looses him in a cemetery.  The incident causes Walter to be late meeting his wife for dinner, which leads her to browsing a used bookstore, where she finds a self-published book about the number 23 that she buys for Walter as a gift.  Apparently Walter was so late that Agatha was able to read the entire book while waiting for him.  Walter must be a slow reader because it takes him over a week before he finishes it at the end of which time he finds himself going slightly insane, seeing the number 23 everywhere he goes and having dreams about murdering his wife.  All reading and no play seems to make Walter a dull boy.  Is Walter really going insane?  Or is the book actually part of a larger story that Walter has become involved in?  Dum, dum, dum, dum, DUM! (Look what I did, onomatopoeia and foreshadowing combined!).I was really disappointed by NUMBER 23.  The concept is so interesting and could be made into a great movie, but NUMBER 23 isn't it.  Jim Carrey does a great job of playing both Walter Sparrow and the character of Fingerling from the novel, but he's not given much of a story to work with.  Either is the lovely Virginia Madsen.  She plays two roles, too, but neither has any real depth.  In fact, none of the characters are very developed at all.  Sometimes that's okay in a mystery suspense film, but not if you don't have much of a story to work with.I will give the filmmakers credit, though.  There are many people who will not like the ending of the film and even though I was disappointed, I'm glad they tried to bring closure to the whole story.  Many times in mystery-thriller and suspense the films end ambiguously with no closure.  As my parents used to say, ""That's a dumb ending.""  NUMBER 23 doesn't have a dumb ending.  Instead, it has a middle that doesn't make any sense.  I'd most like to see a film that makes sense all or at least most of the way through, but given a mindless middle or a dumb ending I think I would rather take the dumb ending.",3,3.2 Stars,1172534400,"02 27, 2007",2007,2898,"['When', 'saw', 'preview', 'NUMBER', '23', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'concept', 'number', '23', 'being', 'part', 'global', 'conspiracy', 'great', 'idea', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'Also', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'choosing', 'roles', 'display', 'full', 'range', 'acting', 'talents', 'not', 'just', 'ones', 'show', 'comic', 'prowess', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'film', 'instead', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'saw', 'hacked', 'up', 'film', 'barely', 'mystery', 'thrills', 'very', 'little', 'suspense.Carrey', 'portrays', 'Walter', 'Sparrow', 'older', 'man', 'married', 'younger', 'woman', 'named', 'Agatha', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'who', 'bakery', 'Walter', 'animal', 'control', 'specialist', 'Apparently', 'Walter', 'job', ""n't"", 'exciting', 'something', 'doing', 'end', 'work', 'day', 'birthday', 'bitten', 'stray', 'dog', 'dog', 'cemetery', 'incident', 'causes', 'Walter', 'be', 'late', 'meeting', 'wife', 'dinner', 'browsing', 'used', 'bookstore', 'where', 'self-published', 'book', 'number', '23', 'Walter', 'gift', 'Apparently', 'Walter', 'was', 'so', 'late', 'Agatha', 'was', 'able', 'read', 'entire', 'book', 'waiting', 'Walter', 'must', 'be', 'slow', 'reader', 'over', 'week', 'end', 'time', 'going', 'slightly', 'insane', 'seeing', 'number', '23', 'everywhere', 'having', 'dreams', 'murdering', 'wife', 'reading', 'play', 'make', 'Walter', 'dull', 'boy', 'Walter', 'really', 'going', 'insane', 'book', 'actually', 'part', 'larger', 'story', 'Walter', 'become', 'involved', 'Dum', 'dum', 'dum', 'dum', 'DUM', 'Look', 'what', 'did', 'onomatopoeia', 'foreshadowing', 'combined', '.I', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'NUMBER', '23', 'concept', 'so', 'interesting', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'great', 'movie', 'NUMBER', '23', ""n't"", 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'Walter', 'Sparrow', 'character', 'Fingerling', 'novel', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'story', 'work', 'lovely', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'two', 'roles', 'too', 'real', 'depth', 'fact', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'developed', 'okay', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'film', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'story', 'work', 'with.I', 'will', 'give', 'filmmakers', 'credit', 'though', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'ending', 'film', 'even', 'was', 'disappointed', ""'m"", 'glad', 'tried', 'bring', 'closure', 'whole', 'story', 'Many', 'times', 'mystery-thriller', 'suspense', 'films', 'end', 'ambiguously', 'closure', 'parents', 'used', 'say', 'dumb', 'ending', '23', ""n't"", 'have', 'dumb', 'ending', 'Instead', 'middle', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', ""'d"", 'most', 'like', 'see', 'film', 'sense', 'least', 'most', 'way', 'given', 'mindless', 'middle', 'dumb', 'ending', 'think', 'would', 'rather', 'take', 'dumb', 'ending']",N/A

Throughout the movie, the main character is reading a book and they play out parts of the book while he is reading it, now these fictional flashbacks are just cheezy.

I am not disappointed by him at all, it's the script that is boring and it was kind of predictable what was happening half way into the film. It could have been a very good thriller, but there was very little horror or suspense about it. The characters are confusing and the film is so slow. It was so hard to enjoy this film. I really like Virginia Madsen and Carrey's performances, and they both get to play double characters so that's a bit more interesting to watch. The story was out of focus, there was so much on the mystery behind # 23 and then there is a twist and turn that leads to a new subplot that has nothing to do with the # 23....Oh well, it's one of those times when Carrey picks the wrong project and you just rather see him do another comedy.",3,Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen tried their best to save the show....,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,904,"['am', 'always', 'fascinated', 'whenever', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'tries', 'do', 'serious', 'non-comedy', 'film', 'see', 'what', 'capable', 'terms', 'showing', 'more', 'range', 'am', 'not', 'disappointed', 'script', 'boring', 'was', 'kind', 'predictable', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'half', 'way', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'thriller', 'there', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'horror', 'suspense', 'characters', 'are', 'confusing', 'film', 'so', 'slow', 'was', 'so', 'hard', 'enjoy', 'film', 'really', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'Carrey', 'performances', 'get', 'play', 'double', 'characters', 'bit', 'more', 'interesting', 'watch', 'story', 'was', 'focus', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'mystery', '23', 'then', 'twist', 'turn', 'new', 'subplot', 'nothing', 'do', '23', '.Oh', 'well', 'one', 'times', 'when', 'Carrey', 'wrong', 'project', 'just', 'rather', 'see', 'do', 'comedy']",N/A

It has elements of all these but something tells me it wasn't meant as a comedy! Jim Carrey's attempt at a ""serious"" movie didn't quite work out the way everyone hoped. I kept waiting for the big joke to come...the point when it became so ridiculous that I would burst out laughing going ""Oh I get it!"" and realize it all had one big hilarious punch line...But that didn't happen. By the end I was laughing because I was like, ""Were they REALLY serious about this?"" It wasn't so much that Jim was playing a serious role, so much as he looked like HE honestly wanted to laugh too.The plot pretty much goes in all crazy directions before finally leading you to a predictable ending. The final resolution makes sense but it is a little anti-climactic in my opinion. Jim Carrey plays Walter Sparrow, an animal control officer living a normal married life. Things take a turn for the worse when his wife Agatha (Virgina Madsen, she did a great job in the dual role as wife/femme fatale so the movie wins a star there) gives him a book for his birthday.The book ""The Number 23"" is about a detective named Fingerling who is cursed by...you guessed it...the number 23! (insert cheesy ominous music here) Soon Walter notices strange parallels between himself and the Fingerling character and are you ready for this?...The number 23 keeps popping up EVERYWHERE in Walter's life from his birthday to his address, his name...You get the idea. In fact he finds so many similarities between himself and this psycho, murdering Fingerling character that he is positive (gasp) ""someone"" who knows him well must have written it. Walter does find out who wrote the book but for anyone who is perceptive, it is pretty obvious early on.This WAS a pretty bad movie but certainly not the worst I have seen. I actually found it quite entertaining though I admit it was for all the wrong reasons! I have a warped sense of humor and I am a fan of ""So bad they're good"" movies. This wasn't bad enough to be good but I still had a few laughs. If you like to laugh at movies this does have potential. I would LOVE to see a Rifftrax made for this film!Anyone that could play this part with a straight face deserves some credit! Jim...you HAD to know this was bad, seriously! The Fingerling detective role was especially cheesy and laughable, almost like a comic book character. We also get to see a tattooed, freaky Jim Carey playing Fingerling and Virginia Madsen playing the femme fatale ""Fabritzia"" character (in a black wig) doing some crazy, stylized sex scenes.The movie did have a cool, creepy vibe and I liked the WAY it was filmed. This movie really didn't have to suck. It was a good idea and it probably had a decent budget, it was just poorly written and poorly executed. If it had a better plot this could have been a great movie. Personally, I think it would have been better with a crazier ending. It was a crazy, unrealistic movie so why should the ending make sense? The rest of it sure didn't! It had some gore, especially in the dream sequences but unless you find blood `shocking' you probably won't be frightened. They should have made it scarier. Numbers aren't scary...but wait...I WAS very torn on my rating. I could not decide if I wanted to give this a 2 or 3 star...2? 3? NOOOOO! The number 23 is after me!Anyway, rent this before you buy it for sure! Unless you are a die-hard Jim Carrey fan you probably won't like this. If you are a fan (like me) you might be entertained. I admit though it was more the fact that I was laughing AT the movie more than anything else! I am sure Jim Carrey was laughing all the way to the bank. Unfortunately in the case of this movie 2+3 does not= a 5 star movie, it mostly= A stinker!
