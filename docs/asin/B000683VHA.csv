862870,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B000683VHA,Michael Butts,"[4, 5]","The idea of casting usual all-American Christian Slater as a deadly psychotic corporate headhunter was inspired, and although PURSUED ultimately falls apart by the end, it's an entertaining little thriller.  Slater plays a headhunter who goes to extremes to ensure that the people he's hunting take the jobs they are offered.  His latest target is played by Gil Bellows; Bellows is a computer whiz who has developed a computer chip that when embedded in a person's bloodstream will enable them to be traced.  This would be extremely beneficial in tracking missing persons, for instance.  Bellows, however, turns down Slater's job offer and that's when all hell breaks loose.  Slater stalks him and his family, endearing himself to both Bellows' wife and young daughter, and a deadly game of cat and mouse ensues.Slater is devilishly fun in his role, but Bellows seems in a daze most of the time and a stronger performer might have made the whole game more intriguing.

I know the fans of Christian Slater might look at it differently, but for me watching this horrible thriller turned out one of the most painful experiences.  I believe even some of Slater's fans might have felt the same way.Slater plays a baddie here. He is Vincent Palmer, one of the top corporate headhunter who won't take no for an answer. He wants Ben Keats (Gil Bellows), who invented a revolutionary GPS system, so Vincent uses everything to recruit him. I mean, EVERYTHING.Even if you don't know the world of executive recruiters (and I don't either), you are going to find Vincent Palmer and his bahaviors so incredible and preposterous. He starts with frequent phone calls, then sending presents, next spying on Keats and his family with monitors, and look! the guy shows up everywhere! Usually what Vincent does is called stalking, but none of the Keats notices this guy played by overacting Slater with menacing eyes is in fact a dangerous man until the very last moment.What kind of company do you think would hire this dangerous guy with psychotic behaviors, whose dubious reputation can be easily detected on the internet? What kind of police, especially police of Seattle where this film is set, can allow this guy do whatever he wants when there are lots of (yes, lots of ) physical evidence that point to him? Like the PCs in the deserted warehouse? Like the forged signs?  Like...Besides too many plot holes, the acting is so-so at best.  In addition to over-the-top Slater and Bellows, Estella Warren and Oscar nominee Michael Clarke Duncan appear.  Estella Warren is not much different from her in 'Driven' and 'Planet of the Apes,' and even Michael Clarke Duncan looks as if he does not know what to do in this mess.'Pursued' and 'Alone in the Dark.' Two of these recent Christian Slater films can easily kill the career, or maybe already did.
