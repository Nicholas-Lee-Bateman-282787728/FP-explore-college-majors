1594505,AOB5695UUUJ0,B009B82F6Y,"Anime Lover ""D""","[2, 4]","The Tenchi Muyo movies - three stories based out of the Tenchi Universe series rather than the OVA's, each one unique yet fits somehow into the overall series that this classic group grew into over the years.Tenchi Muyo in Love - The first.  When a super powerful criminal escapes from the GXP he only has one mission, destroy the Jurian royal family by going to Earth.  As the gang gets ready for movie night to see old home movies of Tenchi's mother and father Washu and Kionye get warnings that something is wrong and when Tenchii starts to disappear Washu saves him by using a temporal shield.  However as it is only temporary, they realize they must go into the past and see what events brought about an end to Tenchi's bloodline or their histories will change.  There they meet Tenchi's mother and father and realize that to protect them they need to get close - Aiayka and Ryoko are students, Mihoshi is a Teacher, Kiyone the janitor, while Sasami and Ryo Ohki watch over Tenchi with Washu as temporal guardian.  The group confront Kain at, of all places, Toyko Tower (I swear there is a big target above this thing as every time there is a distaster it seems to be the focus) in order to save the people and future they love.Daughter of Darkness - Tenchi is a Daddy, or at least that is what a young girl named Miyuki says.  But is there more to the story than meets the eye and can the gang figure out events from Yosho's past before Tenchi and the Musaki family are destroyed.Tenchi Forever - The third - Tenchi is missing, and the girls work to find him.  When Aiayka and Ryoko find him in Toyko, he has no memory of them, he is older than when they last saw him, and appears to be in love with a woman named Hurana.  But Tenchi is suffering for crippling headaches which threaten to kill him. Can Ryoko be the one that can save him from a crumbling world in which he was a part of.All three were well done (though some argue the second one is filler - but fun still).  I am glad Funimaton got the rights to bring these to not only existing fans but to new ones as well.",5,Three Movies - one price - and a lot of explosions,1352937600,"11 15, 2012",2012,2081,"['Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'movies', 'three', 'stories', 'based', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'series', 'rather', 'OVA', 'one', 'unique', 'somehow', 'overall', 'series', 'classic', 'group', 'grew', 'years.Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Love', 'first', 'When', 'super', 'powerful', 'criminal', 'escapes', 'GXP', 'only', 'one', 'mission', 'destroy', 'Jurian', 'royal', 'family', 'going', 'Earth', 'gang', 'ready', 'movie', 'night', 'see', 'old', 'home', 'movies', 'Tenchi', 'mother', 'father', 'Washu', 'Kionye', 'get', 'warnings', 'something', 'wrong', 'when', 'Tenchii', 'disappear', 'Washu', 'using', 'temporal', 'shield', 'However', 'only', 'temporary', 'realize', 'must', 'go', 'past', 'see', 'what', 'events', 'brought', 'end', 'Tenchi', 'bloodline', 'histories', 'will', 'change', 'meet', 'Tenchi', 'mother', 'father', 'realize', 'protect', 'need', 'get', 'close', 'Aiayka', 'Ryoko', 'are', 'students', 'Mihoshi', 'Teacher', 'Kiyone', 'janitor', 'Sasami', 'Ryo', 'Ohki', 'watch', 'Tenchi', 'Washu', 'temporal', 'guardian', 'group', 'Kain', 'places', 'Toyko', 'Tower', 'swear', 'big', 'target', 'thing', 'time', 'distaster', 'be', 'focus', 'order', 'save', 'people', 'future', 'love.Daughter', 'Darkness', 'Tenchi', 'Daddy', 'least', 'what', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Miyuki', 'there', 'more', 'story', 'eye', 'can', 'gang', 'figure', 'events', 'Yosho', 'past', 'Tenchi', 'Musaki', 'family', 'are', 'destroyed.Tenchi', 'Forever', 'third', 'Tenchi', 'missing', 'girls', 'work', 'find', 'When', 'Aiayka', 'Ryoko', 'find', 'Toyko', 'memory', 'older', 'when', 'last', 'saw', 'be', 'love', 'woman', 'named', 'Hurana', 'Tenchi', 'suffering', 'crippling', 'headaches', 'threaten', 'kill', 'Can', 'Ryoko', 'be', 'one', 'can', 'save', 'crumbling', 'world', 'was', 'part', 'three', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'argue', 'second', 'one', 'filler', 'fun', 'still', 'am', 'glad', 'Funimaton', 'got', 'rights', 'bring', 'not', 'only', 'existing', 'fans', 'new', 'ones', 'as', 'well']",Tenchi Muyo!: Movie Collection

1594507,AEQ8WWTOB9VSO,B009B82F6Y,Dent K.,"[3, 4]","While most anime movies tend to be seen as nothing but filler or cash-ins, that is not always the case. These 3 movies are certainly not low-level entries, but this movie trilogy has some of the best moments in the entire Tenchi franchise.Tenchi Muyo The Movie:Tenchi and the ladies must stop a super criminal that has escaped from the GXP. He escaped into the year 1970 and somehow attacked Tenchi's future mother. The gang must go back in time to stop this criminal from changing the future. This takes place after Tenchi Universe and is a very well done movie. The whole ""going into the past"" thing sounds corny, but they pulled it off well. Achika (Tenchi's mother) is a strong character, and you really start to feel for her as the story goes on. There is some comedy but the film goes more for the ""race against time"" theme, for the better though I will admit. The final showdown is really well done and really makes the movie stand out compared to the TV shows. In short, it is a great little movie.Tenchi Muyo the Movie 2: Tenchi and the girls meet a young girl named Mayuka. She claims to be Tenchi's daughter and of course this throws the household into chaos. It is not really clear which series this takes place in, some say that it takes place in the Universe saga and others say it takes place in the Tokyo timeline. In the end it's best to just forget about that, and just move on. Anyway, of the 3 movies this is the closest to the TV shows style. You get Tenchi and the girls getting involved into some kind of trouble. Mayuka only adds to the trouble of course, and this causes some major tension(with Ryoko especially). This one feels more like and extended episode of the TV shows, and it lacks the strong story that the first movie has. Still, it's good, not great, but still worth a watch.Tenchi Forever: One day Tenchi sees a strange woman near the Misaki shrine, when he begins to dream. He wakes up as an older fellow living in Tokyo with a woman named Haruna. The other girls are desperate to find Tenchi as it's been 6 months since he vanished. Ryoko and Ayeka travel to Tokyo to find any clue to Tenchi's whereabouts. Unlike the TV series and the other movies, this movie is far different. The story instead of a comedy, is a serious romantic drama. The movie is quite melodramatic, and the story is quite deep. You feel for the girls as they try everything to find Tenchi, and how heartbroken they feel that they may never find him. It's weird watching a cast of usually silly characters become deep individuals who just want Tenchi to return. The movie also reveals the real reason that Grandpa Misaki left the plant Jurai. This was meant to end the Tenchi Universe saga and though different, it is a wonderful picture.You get all 3 movies for a reasonable price, so if you are a Tenchi fan, you can't pass this up.How are the movies? Let's answer this with some questions......Is the 1st movie worth buying alone? Yes, no question.Is the 2nd movie worth an individual buy? Yes, though it's not as good.Is the 3rd movie worth a purchase by itself? Yes, it's wonderful.In the end you get 2 great movies and 1 good movie for a good price. Heck the 1st movie and 3rd movie are some of the best anime movies I have ever seen. If you are getting into Tenchi, do not skip on the movies. They are worth your time no questions asked.",5,This movie trilogy will not disappoint.,1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,3355,"['most', 'anime', 'movies', 'tend', 'be', 'seen', 'nothing', 'filler', 'cash-ins', 'not', 'always', 'case', '3', 'movies', 'are', 'certainly', 'not', 'low-level', 'entries', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'best', 'moments', 'entire', 'Tenchi', 'franchise.Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Movie', 'Tenchi', 'ladies', 'must', 'stop', 'super', 'criminal', 'escaped', 'GXP', 'escaped', 'year', '1970', 'somehow', 'attacked', 'Tenchi', 'future', 'mother', 'gang', 'must', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'stop', 'criminal', 'changing', 'future', 'place', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'whole', 'going', 'past', 'thing', 'corny', 'pulled', 'off', 'well', 'Achika', 'Tenchi', 'mother', 'strong', 'character', 'really', 'start', 'feel', 'story', 'comedy', 'film', 'more', 'race', 'time', 'theme', 'better', 'will', 'admit', 'final', 'showdown', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'really', 'movie', 'stand', 'out', 'compared', 'TV', 'shows', 'short', 'great', 'little', 'movie.Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Movie', '2', 'Tenchi', 'girls', 'meet', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Mayuka', 'be', 'Tenchi', 'daughter', 'course', 'household', 'chaos', 'not', 'really', 'clear', 'series', 'place', 'say', 'place', 'Universe', 'saga', 'others', 'say', 'place', 'Tokyo', 'timeline', 'end', 'best', 'just', 'forget', 'just', 'move', 'Anyway', '3', 'movies', 'closest', 'TV', 'style', 'get', 'Tenchi', 'girls', 'getting', 'involved', 'kind', 'trouble', 'Mayuka', 'only', 'trouble', 'course', 'major', 'tension', 'Ryoko', 'especially', 'one', 'more', 'like', 'extended', 'episode', 'TV', 'shows', 'strong', 'story', 'first', 'movie', 'Still', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'still', 'watch.Tenchi', 'Forever', 'One', 'day', 'Tenchi', 'strange', 'woman', 'Misaki', 'shrine', 'when', 'dream', 'up', 'older', 'fellow', 'living', 'Tokyo', 'woman', 'named', 'Haruna', 'other', 'girls', 'are', 'desperate', 'find', 'Tenchi', 'been', '6', 'months', 'vanished', 'Ryoko', 'Ayeka', 'travel', 'Tokyo', 'find', 'clue', 'Tenchi', 'whereabouts', 'TV', 'series', 'other', 'movies', 'movie', 'far', 'different', 'story', 'instead', 'comedy', 'serious', 'romantic', 'drama', 'movie', 'quite', 'melodramatic', 'story', 'quite', 'deep', 'feel', 'girls', 'try', 'everything', 'find', 'Tenchi', 'how', 'heartbroken', 'feel', 'may', 'never', 'find', 'weird', 'watching', 'cast', 'usually', 'silly', 'characters', 'become', 'deep', 'individuals', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'Tenchi', 'return', 'movie', 'also', 'real', 'reason', 'Grandpa', 'Misaki', 'left', 'plant', 'Jurai', 'was', 'meant', 'end', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'saga', 'different', 'wonderful', 'picture.You', 'get', '3', 'movies', 'reasonable', 'price', 'are', 'Tenchi', 'fan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up.How', 'are', 'movies', 'Let', 'answer', 'questions', '1st', 'movie', 'worth', 'buying', 'alone', 'Yes', 'question.Is', '2nd', 'movie', 'individual', 'buy', 'Yes', 'not', 'good.Is', '3rd', 'movie', 'worth', 'purchase', 'Yes', 'wonderful.In', 'end', 'get', '2', 'great', 'movies', '1', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'price', 'Heck', '1st', 'movie', '3rd', 'movie', 'are', 'best', 'anime', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'are', 'getting', 'Tenchi', 'do', 'not', 'skip', 'movies', 'are', 'time', 'questions', 'asked']",Tenchi Muyo!: Movie Collection

1594509,A13VBXAMKNK95X,B009B82F6Y,Kerick Howlett,"[1, 1]","I have been a Tenchi Muyo! fan for a long time, so much so that I searched rigorously for the DVD copies when Genco was still a by-product of Pioneer and not of Universal Studios or Funimation! And needless to say for any hardcore Anime fan out there, I was not excited to hear about how Funimation bought out the English rights to Tenchi Muyo!, and the latest work clearly shows my worries.But luckily the dubbing here for all three movies were all done by the original cast from Pioneer! And although the sound in my opinion sounds pretty much standard in terms of 2.1 Stereo, (just could be my crappy RCA stereo though so take that part with a grain of salt), but the upscale quality of the Blu-Ray videos are very well done. I was very impressed, because usually Funimation does a really crappy job at that. Now even though you can still see some grain, its from the original artwork of the animation and not at all the result of bad pixilation. But never the less it looks good.Now I know they force the DVD's on some of you you and that on the other hand I think look's very pixilated! The original DVD's done by Genco and Pioneer were a lot better! I think what Funimation tried to do was upscale the DVD quality for more modern wide screen televisions, as opposed to the original squared 420p tube television that was actually intended for during the 90's. Honestly I think they should've left that part alone.Now the movie's themselves are a different matter, a matter in which I'll be very brief.Tenchi Muyo in Love! - Taking place after the events of the Tenchi Universe continuum, It is a story where an A1 class criminal escapes from a subspace prison and goes back in time to kill a woman by the name of Achika Musaki, Tenchi's mother. So Tenchi in the gang must go back in time to the 70's to stop him so that Tenchi can still be born.I think that these are the weakest of the movies only because it has some serious plot holes that they never address. Such as why Kane goes back in time in the first place. I won't give away any spoiler's but after you watch it and REALLY think about it. You start to see where I'm coming from. However, I'm actually surprised that they don't do any time period jokes about the funky age of the 70's like a lot of movies were doing at the time. Or maybe that's just an American thing.Tenchi Muyo! Daughter of Darkness - This movie is the only one that kind of stands on its own in terms of the timeline continuums. It's more that it shares attributed from pieces of the only two at the time (before Tenchi in Tokyo), as it shares the Light Hawk Wings from the OVA series, and Det. Kiyone from Tenchi Universe. Anyways, it's about how a demon of the Tree of Darkness, Yazuha, creates a genetic specimen from her silver hair and Tenchi's black hair. That essentially gives birth to Tenchi's daughter! This is actually both a very touching as well as very funny movie with a lot of action that is a lot better than the last. It shows a lot of strong character development, mostly in terms of Ryoko, but sadly it kind of doesn't mean anything as its not building from any of the series. But there is some light touching on possible incest and jailbait exploitation....you'll know what I mean after watching the movie. But besides those few uncomfortable minutes of footage, it's still worth a look-see.Tenchi Muyo in Love 2! (Tenchi Forever!) - This is an actual sequel from the first movie as well as the Tenchi Universe continuum. It's where Tenchi is abducted by a spirit of a Jurian Camellia tree named, Haruna. Although it does take a theme from the original OVA's in terms of the Jurian Royal Trees, it is still just Tenchi Universe related. Anyways, the gang spend an entire year looking for Tenchi where it ends up taking Ryoko and Ayeka to Tokyo (which makes sense because this was around the time Tenchi in Tokyo series came out and the animation clearly shows). Mean while, Tenchi finds himself married to this beautiful woman with porcelain skin named Haruna, but with absolutely no memories of his former life. There is very little action in this movie, but in my opinion is by far the best one out of all three movies! It's nice to see a company that actually gets better at making movies with each attempt. And not to mention, Tenchi finally gets lucky (from none of the other six girls), and there is some animated upper body nudity.Anyways, that's my two cents. Sorry about the length, and I hope you enjoy it!",4,"A review from the Biggest ""Tenchi Muyo!""
