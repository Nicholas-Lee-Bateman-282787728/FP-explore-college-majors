For those fortunate to be able to visit these cemeteries where 125,000 military men and women lie buried in foreign lands become instantly aware of the sacredness of these designated places.  They are grateful that these cemeteries are well landscaped and beautifully maintained.  One who visited  a First World War cemetery north west of Paris will always remember hearing the perpetual sound of thousands of song birds, and the bell tower sounding the hour. That day there was an absence of visitors except oneself accompanied by two friends.  The landscaped grass grounds with its rows of  white marble crosses, or the Star of David, marked where an American warrior lay buried.

There are 24 cemeteries that are a reminder to those on whose soil Americans fought.This documentary is a splendid example of how these cemeteries not only honor the dead but are also for the living. The narration and filming capture the heart of the hallowed grounds. If you have never walked through one of them, you have missed one of the most moving experiences in the world. They are indeed a symbol of peace and the price of war.The film gives short narrations of battles and the nearby cemeteries from France and Belgium to the Pacific; of course not all can be covered in this one DVD. Some examples of the men and women who are buried there are given. It would be hard not to be moved watching this. The surrounding countrymen's impressions and visits as well as those of visiting Americans are shown. Students of history and veterans would be well served by viewing this.This is the next best thing to visiting where these men and women died far from home. These are some of the most peaceful places on earth and the film serves this spirit well.
