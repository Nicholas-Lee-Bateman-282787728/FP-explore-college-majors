It is an excellent film, in its own right, and one of the best portraits of a midlife crisis ever put to film. It's not a perfect film, in that, at two hours and twenty four minutes it's about a half hour too long, and there's a bit too much emphasis on the drunkenness of the lead character Myrtle Gordon, played by Gena Rowlands, the wife of Cassavetes, long after we've gotten the point. But only Woody Allen's masterpiece, Another Woman, which also starred Rowlands, eleven years later, is a better portrait of the internal conflicts of an aging woman. Yet, Rowlands did win the Best Actress Award at the Berlin Film Festival for this portrayal, and it was well deserved. Often this film, written by Cassavetes, is easily compared to his earlier- and inferior- film, A Woman Under The Influence, but it's a spurious comparison. Rowlands' character in that film is severely mentally disturbed from the start, as well as coming from a blue collar background, while her characters in this film and in Allen's film are both artists who are haunted by apparitions. In this film it's the ghost of a dead young woman who can be seen as Myrtle's younger doppelganger, while in Allen's film it's her character's own past.... Many critics have taken this film to be a portrait of an alcoholic, seeing Myrtle surround herself with enablers, such as a stage manager who tells her, during opening night, `I've seen alot of drunks in my time, but I've never seen anyone as drunk as you who could stand up. You're great!', but this is wrong, for alcohol isn't her problem- nor is her chain smoking. They are merely diversions from whatever thing is really compelling her to her own destruction, and much to Cassavetes' credit, as a storyteller, he never lets us find out exactly what's wrong with Myrtle, and despite her coming through in the end, there's no reason to expect that she has really resolved anything of consequence. This sort of end without resolution links Cassavetes directly with the more daring European directors of the recent past, who were comfortable in not revealing everything to an audience, and forcing their viewers to cogitate, even if it hurts.Yet, the film recapitulates perfectly the effect of a drunk or fever lifting out of the fog, and as such the viewer again is subliminally involved in its drama. Whether or not Myrtle Gordon does recover, after the film's universe irises about her is left for each and every viewer to decide, and as we have seen before that lid closes, one's choices do matter.",5,Damned good,1221436800,"09 15, 2008",2008,2646,"['John', 'Cassavetes', '1977', 'film', 'Opening', 'Night', 'what', 'critics', 'usually', 'call', 'work', 'such', 'significant', 'artist', 'overlooked', 'excellent', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'one', 'best', 'portraits', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'twenty', 'four', 'minutes', 'half', 'hour', 'too', 'long', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'drunkenness', 'lead', 'character', 'Myrtle', 'Gordon', 'played', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'wife', 'Cassavetes', 'long', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'point', 'only', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'masterpiece', 'Woman', 'also', 'starred', 'Rowlands', 'eleven', 'years', 'later', 'better', 'portrait', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'aging', 'woman', 'Rowlands', 'did', 'win', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Award', 'Berlin', 'Film', 'Festival', 'portrayal', 'was', 'well', 'deserved', 'Often', 'film', 'written', 'Cassavetes', 'easily', 'compared', 'earlier-', 'inferior-', 'film', 'A', 'Woman', 'Influence', 'spurious', 'comparison', 'Rowlands', 'character', 'film', 'severely', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'start', 'as', 'well', 'coming', 'blue', 'collar', 'background', 'characters', 'film', 'Allen', 'film', 'are', 'artists', 'who', 'are', 'haunted', 'apparitions', 'film', 'ghost', 'dead', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Myrtle', 'younger', 'doppelganger', 'Allen', 'film', 'character', 'own', 'past', 'Many', 'critics', 'have', 'taken', 'film', 'be', 'portrait', 'alcoholic', 'seeing', 'Myrtle', 'surround', 'enablers', 'such', 'stage', 'manager', 'who', 'opening', 'night', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'alot', 'drunks', 'time', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anyone', 'as', 'drunk', 'who', 'could', 'stand', 'up', ""'re"", 'great', 'wrong', 'alcohol', ""n't"", 'problem-', 'chain', 'smoking', 'are', 'merely', 'diversions', 'whatever', 'thing', 'really', 'compelling', 'own', 'destruction', 'much', 'Cassavetes', 'credit', 'storyteller', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'wrong', 'Myrtle', 'coming', 'end', 'reason', 'expect', 'really', 'resolved', 'anything', 'consequence', 'sort', 'end', 'resolution', 'links', 'directly', 'more', 'daring', 'European', 'directors', 'recent', 'past', 'who', 'were', 'comfortable', 'not', 'revealing', 'everything', 'audience', 'forcing', 'viewers', 'cogitate', 'even', 'film', 'perfectly', 'effect', 'drunk', 'fever', 'lifting', 'fog', 'such', 'viewer', 'again', 'subliminally', 'involved', 'drama', 'not', 'Myrtle', 'Gordon', 'recover', 'film', 'universe', 'irises', 'left', 'viewer', 'decide', 'have', 'seen', 'lid', 'choices', 'do', 'matter']",N/A

As a strong actress with an ability to find, reveal, and let us see the deep motivations that cloud our emotions, blur our intellect, and find justifications for decisions that are a little off-center, she is one of the best. ""Opening Night"" is a story of a popular but aging star about to open in a live-production, written by Joan Blondell, and follows her struggle to maintain her grip on life as extremely stressful events force her into more and more intense bouts of drinking. This condition worsens as the opening night approaches, and by the night of the big opening, arriving so late the production is almost cancelled, and so intoxicated she cannot stand by herself, we follow her intense struggle to ""do her job"".

This story shows a human being during a period of deep emotional turmoil, and professional confusion.The main character is Myrtle Gordon (played by a wonderful Gena Rowlands),a famous actress that is unable to cop with the death of a young admirer, killed in an accident near her. As if that were enough, Myrtle is afraid of really playing her part in a new play, due to the fact that she is supposed to be a woman that is getting old, something that she knows is true in real life. How does Myrtle cope with her fear of aging, and her remorse for not being there for her fan? What if she feels she is not able to act anymore?

Rowlands' complex portrayal of a famous actress who overly identifies with her character in a play--reflecting her own mid-age insecurities (no surprise for mid-40s starlets), is one of the finest I have seen on the screen. I knew she was good, but I never realized how good. Her drunken opening night performance was incredible, though her transformation from dead drunk in the first scene to cold sober? in the last seemed a bit unreal. Was it the black coffee?Ben Gazzara, Cassavetes' buddy, played the harassed and empathetic director,and I thought he gave a convincing performance. Joan Blondell was quite good as the persevering writer (how much of the opening night performance was her script is debatable); Paul Stewart, an ex-patriot of Orson Welles' Mercury Theater, was the producer. Stewart and Blondell performed like old pros. John Cassevetes had enough to do as the film's writer and director to contribute as much as an actor. And there were even glimpses of Peter Falk,the third actor of this triumvirate of acting buddies who made a bunch of movies together largely reflecting, one suspects, their own lives.

She's on the verge of nervous breakdown, dued to her lack of self-esteem and confidence in starring in her new play. She doesn't feel comfortable playing the new role, because she worried that if she's convincing enough that her audiences would accept her for just being one kind of character. During the course of two days before the opening night, she gets into feuds with the playwright, director, and producer. She is haunted by the ghost of her youth, whom she couldn't let go of, and embrace her real age. Ultimately, she had to abuse alcohol and chain-smoking before going on stage.
