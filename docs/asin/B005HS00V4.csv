1461219,AIHL5LTLS535Y,B005HS00V4,Barry Berlin,"[0, 0]","Peter Gabriel: New Blood-Live in London 3D Blu Ray is one of the best 3D discs I have purchased.  Peter Gabriel has made this concert to be watched in three dimensions and the concert, the 3D effects, and the music are excellent. Paul Simon once wrote ""These are the days of miracles and wonder"" this Blu Ray will confirm his declaration.  They used numerous 3D cameras to record this disc and you actually feel that you are there and you will see infinite varieties of depth in the orchestra and the audience.  The special effects are there too so you will have stuff popping out of the screen as well as feeling as if the performers were in your living room.  Peter Gabriel has aged but his skills as a performer have not diminished although he looks like a fat old guy. That is a bit disconcerting if you have been a fan since the days of his historic rock group Genesis.  The ""New Blood"" of the title refers to The New Blood Orchestra which admirably accompanies him. This concert was recorded in London in March 2011.  There are many songs on the disc and the only fault I could find is that I wasn't familiar with the new material from his album ""Scratch My Back"".  There is plenty of his older music too and the new stuff is great I just was not familiar with it.  You do not need liner notes to know what the lyrics are.  Peter Gabriel and his backup singers enunciate so the words are clear as a bell.  If you are a fan of Peter Gabriel you should purchase this disc in 3D.  It is 3D for adults and not just another animated piece of 3D schlock. Watch it on a large 3D screen if you can.  If you are going to buy a new TV buy the largest you can afford.

Jeanclerc ""Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","[2, 3]","""New Blood - Live in London"" captures Peter Gabriel's most recent experiment in a career distinguished for experimentation.  Built on the ""Scratch my Back"" concept where he covered other artists' songs with an orchestral backing, this show will enthrall staunch Gabriel fans.The setlist begins with a heavy dose of the ""Scratch my Back"" covers resulting in mixed results.  Regina Spektor's ""Apres Moi"" and a playful take on The Magnetic Fields' ""The Book of Love"" are strong tracks, but overall, this section of the show feels like a so-so opening act.  You can tell the audience at the Hammersmith had been ready to pounce on the Gabriel material once those tracks start up in earnest.The often-minimalized orchestral treatment definitely leads to a much more down-tempo vibe for these familiar tracks.  This gives new emotional dimension and power to songs such as ""Signal to Noise"", ""Mercy Street"" and ""Red Rain"".  However, as the setlist progresses, monotony threatens to set in.  You'll breathe a bit easier when the jubilant take on ""Solsbury Hill"" comes up (and even the players seem to feel the same).The video (yes, 1080i video) quality is crisp in this blu-ray release.  Cinematography was up and down - there were several tracks where I wished that the director had matched the less-is-more theme of the performance itself.  This was most evident in the opener ""Intruder"" where hyper-quick cuts from security monitors were a corny distraction.  Fortunately, the rest of the presentation is more reserved.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix is well done - clear and distinct as a performance such as this should be.Overall, the ""New Blood - Live in London"" blu-ray is a great chronicle easily recommended for Gabriel's career fans.",4,An Intriguing (If Not Always Entertaining) Take on Gabriel's Classics,1325030400,"12 28, 2011",2011,1739,"['New', 'Blood', 'Live', 'London', 'captures', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'most', 'recent', 'experiment', 'career', 'distinguished', 'experimentation', 'Built', 'Scratch', 'Back', 'concept', 'where', 'covered', 'other', 'artists', 'songs', 'orchestral', 'backing', 'show', 'will', 'enthrall', 'staunch', 'Gabriel', 'fans.The', 'setlist', 'heavy', 'dose', 'Scratch', 'Back', 'resulting', 'mixed', 'results', 'Regina', 'Spektor', 'Apres', 'Moi', 'playful', 'take', 'Magnetic', 'Fields', 'Book', 'Love', 'are', 'strong', 'tracks', 'overall', 'section', 'show', 'so-so', 'opening', 'act', 'can', 'tell', 'audience', 'Hammersmith', 'had', 'been', 'ready', 'pounce', 'Gabriel', 'material', 'once', 'tracks', 'start', 'up', 'earnest.The', 'often-minimalized', 'orchestral', 'treatment', 'definitely', 'much', 'more', 'down-tempo', 'vibe', 'familiar', 'tracks', 'new', 'emotional', 'dimension', 'power', 'songs', 'such', 'Signal', 'Noise', 'Mercy', 'Street', 'Red', 'Rain', 'However', 'setlist', 'monotony', 'threatens', 'set', ""'ll"", 'breathe', 'bit', 'easier', 'when', 'jubilant', 'take', 'Solsbury', 'Hill', 'up', 'even', 'players', 'seem', 'feel', 'same', '.The', 'video', 'yes', '1080i', 'video', 'quality', 'crisp', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'Cinematography', 'was', 'up', 'down', 'were', 'several', 'tracks', 'where', 'wished', 'director', 'had', 'matched', 'less-is-more', 'theme', 'performance', 'was', 'most', 'evident', 'opener', 'Intruder', 'where', 'hyper-quick', 'cuts', 'security', 'monitors', 'were', 'corny', 'distraction', 'Fortunately', 'rest', 'presentation', 'more', 'reserved', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'mix', 'well', 'done', 'clear', 'distinct', 'performance', 'such', 'should', 'be.Overall', 'New', 'Blood', 'Live', 'London', 'blu-ray', 'great', 'chronicle', 'easily', 'recommended', 'Gabriel', 'career', 'fans']",Peter Gabriel: New Blood - Live in London

1461230,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B005HS00V4,M. Oleson,"[2, 2]","Several weeks ago I purchased Gabriel's dual disc which I gave a 5.0 rating (Oct. 29, 2011).  Buying this concert version of the music was a no brainer especially in Blu ray with a  DTS-HD audio treatment.  I wasn't disappointed.  The concert is long at 162 minutes so there is no cheat on that score.  That's more than double the time on the CD and adds about 7 songs.  Gabriel is no slouch on audio and video tricks and often adds some of his own sound effects to the songs.  He also plays around with one of those small cameras that hang from the ceiling.  This goes on too long and too often for my taste.  While in full voice Peter Gabriel is still a strong vibrant singer but in the brief interludes between songs he talks in a near whisper even while the audience is still clapping.  This makes some of the introductions incomprehensible.  I can't speak highly enough of the fine ""New Blood"" orchestra assembled for this project.  Led by young conductor Ben Foster they are brilliant.  There are no guitars and no drum kits, but there are 50 or so top notch musicians and are masterfully synched to play the great arrangements by John Metcalfe.  Gabriel has vocal backing by his daughter Melanie who has a few solos within the songs and Ane Brun whose voice sounds a bit frail on her one feature (""Don't Give Up"").  Uzbek singer Sevara Nazarkhan shows up for one song (""In Your Eyes"") as well.  The direction that appears on the Blu ray is well done by Blue Leach.  The cameras are well located giving different angles of the singers and the conductor.  Still, it's all about the sound.  The surround versions put you about 15 rows deep in the center.  This is not the Peter Gabriel remembered from the 1980's.  He's more mature and like all artists wants to expand his musical horizons.  He does it here with a bit of new material, a few carefully selected covers and a new approach to his hits.  He doesn't miss.

It's new arrangements of songs with orchestra and a couple of females vocalists. So those news versions are classical oriented and are definitively more relaxed than the original songs. There is also about four songs taken from others composers. Those songs didn't grab my attention as very interesting songs, as some late Gabriel's songs, like ""In Your Eyes"" and ""Don't Give Up"". My favorite songs are from my favorite cd, and it's ""The Rhythm Of The Heat"" and ""San Jacinto"".The music is more of a background sound to let the beautiful voice of Peter shines.

I was floored! This wasn't your average sappy sweet slow string accompaniment - this orchestra WAS the show.This is orchestration on steroids! Think Beethoven mixed with Copeland mixed with Shostakovich, and then turn the volume up to 12. They are totally engaged with every aspect of the music, and the arrangements are absolutely first rate (can't recall the arranger's name).Peter's performance is relegated to more of a vocal accompaniment, as opposed to the center of attention, and he seems to relish his new found role while standing aside and letting this bombastic and talented orchestra give new life to his old standards.If you are one of those people who've always thought an orchestra could never whip up the power and fury of a live rock band, you need to see this. Prepare to pick your jaw up from the floor. Oh, and as if that weren't enough, the visuals are stunning also.I distinctly remember saying to my wife and friends as we were leaving the show that night ""Man, I really hope he puts this concert to DVD"". Well thank you Peter for making that wish come true. I'm putting this pre-order in right now for the DVD. I will review and report back later.FOLLOW UP**********Well, I did finally obtain my copy of this DVD. Being a long time, die hard fan of Peter, it pains me to say it, but I have to pull at least one star from my initial rating. First of all, this is not quite the same set list I saw him perform live here in Philly. Most of his originals were the same, but sadly missing is ""Father and Son"" - a beautiful tribute song he wrote to his father, along with a few other good ones that were on his set list the night I saw them. The cover songs are almost all different, and I must contend that the cover set that I saw them perform was much more interesting.Also, and I'm not sure if this show was done early on in the tour (I would assume it was, being in London) but the performance just doesn't seem to flow like the show I saw. Peter's voice is strong and clear, but he seems a bit ""disconnected"" with the orchestra. And the orchestra itself seems weak and unrehearsed. At some points this almost 100 piece orchestra seems to sound more like an apprehensive, nervous string quartet! And to make matters worse, I feel they were mixed way to far in the background. The live performance I saw the orchestra was EXCITING and engaged - they were on their feet and their sound was powerful and in your face. The entire venue was shaking.So all in all, I'm not sure if it's a performance issue, a sound mixing issue, the choice of songs, or all of the above, but compared to the live show I saw, I can not wholeheartedly recommend this disc. It's probably a nice addition to have for die hard Peter fans just to see and hear how his music transposes into a more classical/orchestrated genre. But don't expect the chills down your spine like the ones experienced at the live performance.",3,....anticipation - will follow up !,1317772800,"10 5, 2011",2011,3069,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'heard', 'DVD', 'yet', 'did', 'see', 'Peter', 'show', 'past', 'summer', 'New', 'Blood', 'Orchestra', 'can', 'tell', 'first', 'hand', 'amazing', 'was', 'floored', 'was', ""n't"", 'average', 'sappy', 'sweet', 'slow', 'string', 'accompaniment', 'orchestra', 'WAS', 'show.This', 'orchestration', 'steroids', 'Think', 'Beethoven', 'mixed', 'Copeland', 'mixed', 'Shostakovich', 'then', 'turn', 'volume', 'up', '12', 'are', 'totally', 'engaged', 'aspect', 'music', 'arrangements', 'are', 'absolutely', 'first', 'rate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'arranger', 'name', '.Peter', 'performance', 'relegated', 'more', 'vocal', 'accompaniment', 'opposed', 'center', 'attention', 'relish', 'new', 'found', 'role', 'standing', 'aside', 'letting', 'bombastic', 'talented', 'orchestra', 'give', 'new', 'life', 'old', 'standards.If', 'are', 'one', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'orchestra', 'could', 'never', 'whip', 'up', 'power', 'fury', 'live', 'rock', 'band', 'need', 'see', 'Prepare', 'pick', 'jaw', 'up', 'floor', 'Oh', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'visuals', 'are', 'stunning', 'also.I', 'distinctly', 'remember', 'saying', 'wife', 'friends', 'were', 'leaving', 'show', 'night', 'Man', 'really', 'hope', 'concert', 'DVD', 'Well', 'Peter', 'making', 'wish', 'come', 'true', ""'m"", 'putting', 'pre-order', 'right', 'now', 'DVD', 'will', 'review', 'report', 'back', 'later.FOLLOW', 'UP**********Well', 'did', 'finally', 'obtain', 'copy', 'DVD', 'Being', 'long', 'time', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'Peter', 'say', 'have', 'pull', 'least', 'one', 'star', 'initial', 'rating', 'First', 'all', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'set', 'list', 'saw', 'perform', 'live', 'here', 'Philly', 'Most', 'originals', 'were', 'same', 'sadly', 'missing', 'Father', 'Son', 'beautiful', 'tribute', 'song', 'wrote', 'father', 'few', 'other', 'good', 'ones', 'were', 'set', 'list', 'night', 'saw', 'cover', 'songs', 'are', 'almost', 'different', 'must', 'contend', 'cover', 'set', 'saw', 'perform', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'interesting.Also', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'show', 'was', 'done', 'early', 'tour', 'would', 'assume', 'was', 'being', 'London', 'performance', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'flow', 'show', 'saw', 'Peter', 'voice', 'strong', 'clear', 'bit', 'disconnected', 'orchestra', 'orchestra', 'weak', 'unrehearsed', 'points', 'almost', '100', 'piece', 'orchestra', 'sound', 'more', 'apprehensive', 'nervous', 'string', 'quartet', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'feel', 'were', 'mixed', 'way', 'far', 'background', 'live', 'performance', 'saw', 'orchestra', 'was', 'EXCITING', 'engaged', 'were', 'feet', 'sound', 'was', 'powerful', 'face', 'entire', 'venue', 'was', 'shaking.So', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'performance', 'issue', 'sound', 'mixing', 'issue', 'choice', 'songs', 'above', 'compared', 'live', 'show', 'saw', 'can', 'not', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'disc', 'probably', 'nice', 'addition', 'have', 'die', 'hard', 'Peter', 'fans', 'just', 'see', 'hear', 'how', 'music', 'more', 'classical/orchestrated', 'genre', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'ones', 'experienced', 'live', 'performance']",Peter Gabriel: New Blood - Live in London
