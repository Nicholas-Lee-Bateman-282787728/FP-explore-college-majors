661751,A19K5DILM15WU3,B00005KARI,Alex,"[7, 7]","I don't generally like Disney's straight to video movies, but since my family bought it, I decided to watch it. It was surprisingly good! It's about a little elephant who wasn't even named when a group of pochers attacked causing he and his mother to seperate. With her promise to find him someday, he joins with a not so kind elephant, Grove, who teaches him how to stay clear of poachers and lions. Giving up hope of his mother still being alive, he accepts grove as his mother, who names him Whispers because thats the noise he makes when hi tries to make an elephants roar. But when Grove is shot by pochers in an attempt to save Whispers, he must find home in the wild jungle. The special features are two animated shorts. One starring goofy attempting to bathe an elephant. The other with Donald trying to take pictures of a wacky bird. The box claims that the film is in fullscreen, but I found a widescreen version is actually what is on the disk. There is also a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound soundtrack.

The filming of the elephants is excellent.  Besides being a love story among the elephants, showing their great caring for one another, it graphically depicts the hideous poaching and slaughter of Africa's elephants.  I wish they would promote this movie in China.

As a lover of both animals and Africa, I truly loved this movie. This is not a cartoon. It is a real movie with real animals filmed in Beautiful Africa! It's a heartwarming tale of a baby elephant named Whispers who becomes seperated from his mother. He desperately tries to find her and runs upon another female adult elephant named Groove. Groove is alone too, for she is an outcast from her herd but she never wanted to have a ""baby"". They end up teaming up together... for she can not resist loveable Whispers.... in order to find Whisper's mother. Along the way, they run into many surprises. All the animals in this movie express themselves with real human voices. The voice of Whispers is just adorable. A great Walt Disney movie for the whole family. You experience not only a touching story but also the beauty of Africa itself. I found this movie so good, that I bought it. Very much worth the money.
