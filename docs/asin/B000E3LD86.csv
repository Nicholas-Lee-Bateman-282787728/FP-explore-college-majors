967610,A2S1TT4ZIKGYND,B000E3LD86,"herb ""nice name huh?""","[3, 3]","This is the best fusion effort I have ever seen. The bassist and drummer are massive. Stern wails...perfect blend of hardcore fusion and Rock. The production is great, could maybe have been better with a few more Chambers angles, but that is isnt really a flaw as much as a testament to my wanting to see every nuance of this amazing band. If I had to find any flaw it would be a subjective one only, dealing w/Stern's guitar sound. Stern's sound may lack a bit of clarity for me, but that is a personal preference, and in no way reflective of the amazing production values in terms of both picture and sound. We all have our own ideas of sound, and again, a non-issue for recommending this masterpiece of heavy riff carnage!. This guy Bona is possibley the best bassist I have ever seen, and I have seen many. And Chambers? Wow...unbelieveable..what amazing feel. The interview section is cool too. You would truley have to ""not get it"" to believe that this is anything but amazing. One of the best Guitar oriented DVD's ever made. 10 STARS! Great effort Mr Stern! Thank you for making this available.",5,"10 stars!  Is this real? Incredible fusion riffage!!

967611,A5XU9GCSRUNMK,B000E3LD86,Jeff Arenson,"[47, 49]","Mike Stern has finally released a live concert of his band. Despite being a touring band leader or co-band leader for over two decades, this is the first concert recording(Cd or Dvd) and it is well worth the wait.Mike Stern is capable of playing blistering rock influenced jazz/fusion, excellent be-bop styled fusion and has an emotional range that is unparalled. He can also phrase a solo and change tones within a song in a way that hardly anyone else can do. This concert DVD showcases everything that Stern is capable of.First of all, I will start with the extras on this DVD. There is a 15 minute interview of Mike. He talks about his musical influences from age 8 to the present. Highlights are his days at Berklee, what it was like to play with Miles and the influence of Beck, Clapton and Hendrix on all guitar players not just rock guitarits. Most of all, Mike comes across as a humble person and not some egomaniac. He truly realizes that the ability to play music for a living is a gift and he seems to recognize that fact. I have met Mike and this is genuine. Also in the Extra Features section is a version of 'After You' from the 1990 tour of the Stern/Berg band. This is a great version of one of Mike's mellower tunes. He starts out unaccompanied for about 5 minutes. This is not an 'Eruption' styled note-fest, but a true jazz/rock styled excursion into chordal phrasing and single note phrasing that shows the emotional depth that Stern is capable of. The actual song contains some great guitar and saxophone playing. Bob Berg and Mike Stern were in Miles' band together and toured together of years. This is a great bonus feature. Another bonus song is a version of Jean-Pierre from 1996. Stern is joined by Dave Weckl on Drums as well as Lincoln Goines(who is also on bass on 'After You') and Bob Sheppard on Saxophone. This is a blistering showcase of Stern's rock influence and he plays with great feeling and wreckless abandon. These two bonus songs showcase the diversity of Mike's Playing.As for the Concert from 'New Morning'in Paris itself, this is another DVD that captures an amazing band at the height of its powers. Mike Stern is joined by Bob Franceschini on Tenor Saxophone. Franceschini is a more than solid sax player and shines throughout this DVD. You probably have never heard of him, but he is very good. Also joining Mike is the incredible Richard Bona on bass. Bona has only one solo spot in the show where he can stretch out, but he does in an amazing fashion. His bass is always busy and he adds fills that accompany the song in the same fashion that a drummer will do fills. He is never too busy so that he forgets to be an anchor for the song, but he still stands out with his unique style in every song. He also adds vocals on 'Still There'. Dennis Chambers is on drums and is his usual unbeleivable self. If you have never seen Dennis play drums, then you are in for a drumming extravaganza. If you have heard Chambers in any of the other bands that he plays in or have seen him live, you can rest assured that this is another mind-boggling performance.Stern opens up with ""Play"" which he has been opening concerts with since 2000. This song is a definite be-bop influenced jazz/rocker. Everyone in the band gets a chance to step out into the spotlight for a solo section. Mike does at least 2 tone changes and builds his solo from a mild jazz start to a distortion laced flurry of notes. This tune showcases what makes Mike Stern unique. His phrasing in perfect and he showcases a variety of techniques into a style that is uniquely his own. Franceschini also builds up a solo from a mellow start. This is the one song where Bona gets to step out and he does so amazingly. Any fan of Bass Guitar should hear this guy and he plays an amazingly phrased solo that showcases his ability to play single notes and chords in a unique style. Dennis Chambers does some amazing things during his solo. He starts out by playing a polyrhythm in which each appendage is playing a different count. He eventually does a couple of different figures and his right arm does some fills that most drummers would need two or more arms. Anyone who has seen him play with Stern knows that this band is the one that Dennis seems to stretch out the most in. Next is 'Slow Change'. This is a blues/rock influenced piece. Stern plays with a feel that is a combination of Clapton and Coltrane. Franceschini solos very well also. Bona is busy filling in space in a tasteful fashion. I don't think that I have heard many bassists who can do 'fills' like a drummer on bass. Lastly, Dennis does his thing and the tune comes to a close. Chambers phrases on drums in a unique fashion and you can tell from the style of his solo that he is trying to stretch out. He does fills with his right hand only that are mind-boggling without sounding like a gimic. If you listen without watching, you'd never believe that he is doing what he does. 'Still There' is a mellow piece where Stern starts out unaccompanied. Like his solo spot in 'After You', this showcases his ability to be truly entertaining without anyone else on stage. He uses a variety of effects and volume knob tricks to give the full effect of more than one guitarist on stage. The band joins in and Bona does some scat style singing on this one. ""Tipatina's"" is another great Be-bop styled rocker and Franceschini plays with a 'New Orleans' style in his solo. Stern is his usual amazing self and phrases impeccably. This song has always been a showcase for Dennis Chambers and he doesn't dissapoint during his extended spot. He takes the rhythm that Stern plays and does all kinds of odd meter, polymeter and some unreal fills in a showcase of his unique funk/Jazz/Fusion style. After Chambers has boggled the mind of everyone in the room, including Bona & Stern, the band breaks into a bit of Blues/Boogie improv. Stern plays ""Ha-Ha Hotel"" as an encore. This is another great version of a funky/jazz song. Stern goes all out on this one, and Bona & Franceschini join in on the fun. They end the song by increasing the pace on the rhythm until it turns into delerium. Stern and company definitely have fun with this one. The 5 songs in the New Morning set take about an hour and twenty minutes so there is plenty of improv everywhere. Add in the two Bonus songs and you have close to 2 hours worth of great music.If you are like me, then you have been waiting for a concert cd or DVD from Mike Stern for a long time. Now one of the greatest guitarists of any genre and one with a truly unique style has released a must have DVD. Musicians as diverse as Joe Satriani, Victor Wooten, Shawn Lane, the Brecker Brothers and many others have been raving about Stern. You can buy this DVD and see what they have all been talking about. This is a must have for anyone who likes Guitar or Jazz/Rock. BUY IT!! You will be glad you did.",5,THE Mike Stern BAND,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,6900,"['Mike', 'Stern', 'finally', 'released', 'live', 'concert', 'band', 'being', 'touring', 'band', 'leader',

It's got great musicians on it, though.  The great thing about Mike is you can tell he plays from the heart with a lot of intensity.  He actually gives 100% when he plays.  I've never seen him with a keyboardist, which is probably what lacks.  Dennis Chambers is a great musician, however, his performance is not really to the audience in as much as it is for himself and to drummers.  There's very little in his solos and even behind the songs that the average listener can appreciate and enjoy on their level.  If you are a drummer you can appreciate what his is doing is very complex, but can get boring for the average listener.  Bob Franciscini has a great sound, but his solos can get a little abstract at times but then he stops and here comes Mike again.  Richard Bona is phenominal on Bass, although he doesn't overplay like the other members of the group it's that fact that makes him shine.  He does a great job on Tipatina.Overall it was a good performance.
