As expected from Palmer, he delivers it artistically, with the right amount of beautiful scenes as well as the ugly ones; the puppets and the hands performance are just great; the short clips of the Nazi era are also well placed and relevant to the story at play. This documentary goes to great length to show Orff's contribution to education through his Schulwerk (Schoolwork) and its dissemination through the world. Orff's music is used extensively through the film, but I was a little bet disappointed that it is not described or talked about too much. Obviously Carmina Burana is explained in terms of his history and background, but no about the music itself. For example, any correlation to Stravinsky's music is not mentioned at all, and there certainly is! Carl Orff the man was exactly that, a man with virtues and guilt. What endures in time, aside of the Schulwerk, is his music, somehow missing in this otherwise great documentary.",4,Great documentary,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,1023,"['Palmer', 'Carl', 'Orff', 'man', 'facets', 'good', 'dubious', 'expected', 'Palmer', 'artistically', 'right', 'amount', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'ugly', 'ones', 'puppets', 'hands', 'performance', 'are', 'just', 'great', 'short', 'clips', 'Nazi', 'era', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'placed', 'relevant', 'story', 'play', 'documentary', 'great', 'length', 'show', 'Orff', 'contribution', 'education', 'Schulwerk', 'Schoolwork', 'dissemination', 'world', 'Orff', 'music', 'used', 'extensively', 'film', 'was', 'little', 'bet', 'disappointed', 'not', 'described', 'talked', 'too', 'much', 'Obviously', 'Carmina', 'Burana', 'explained', 'terms', 'history', 'background', 'music', 'example', 'correlation', 'Stravinsky', 'music', 'not', 'mentioned', 'certainly', 'Carl', 'Orff', 'man', 'was', 'exactly', 'man', 'virtues', 'guilt', 'What', 'time', 'aside', 'Schulwerk', 'music', 'somehow', 'missing', 'otherwise', 'great', 'documentary']","Tony Palmer's Film of O, Fortuna"

Before watching this DVD I knew little about Carl Orff or his music beyond Carmina Burana.  After watching this DVD, I feel that his music deserves to be better known and bought a number of CDs of his non Carmina Burana music.  At a deeper level this DVD deals with the issues of accommodation -- how does one survive and pursue their passion (composing) when the world one knows is dissolving around them.  Though Tony Palmer does not do this with a hammer, the themes of accommodation, survival and guilt are recurrent.  The film is beautifully done.  The interposition of interview, background images and performance provide a strong forward motion that maintains interest.  I watched this DVD twice.  I watched it once and then immediately watched it again, I found it that interesting.",5,A window into the legacy of an unappreciated composer,1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,961,"['What', 'DVD', 'different', 'many', 'others', 'composers', 'large', 'amount', 'video', 'footage', 'available', 'showing', 'Carl', 'Orff', 'times', 'performances', 'work', 'watching', 'DVD', 'knew', 'little', 'Carl', 'Orff', 'music', 'Carmina', 'Burana', 'watching', 'DVD', 'feel', 'music', 'be', 'better', 'known', 'bought', 'number', 'CDs', 'non', 'Carmina', 'Burana', 'music', 'deeper', 'level', 'DVD', 'deals', 'issues', 'accommodation', 'how', 'one', 'survive', 'pursue', 'passion', 'composing', 'when', 'world', 'one', 'dissolving', 'Tony', 'Palmer', 'not', 'do', 'hammer', 'themes', 'accommodation', 'survival', 'guilt', 'are', 'recurrent', 'film', 'beautifully', 'done', 'interposition', 'interview', 'background', 'images', 'performance', 'provide', 'strong', 'forward', 'motion', 'interest', 'watched', 'DVD', 'twice', 'watched', 'once', 'then', 'immediately', 'watched', 'again', 'found', 'interesting']","Tony Palmer's Film of O, Fortuna"
1219005,A3LA1L1TUXV9TN,B001N2PM2A,Martin R. Lash,"[2, 17]","Why did Tony Palmer bother with Carl Orff? Orff has only one real great work, Carmina Burana and the rest of his work is not that good. He is known from his educational work which is noted here but there were other, greater composers like Hindemith that made important contributions to education and music. Palmer seems to be interested in whether or not Orff was sympathetic to the Third Reich which remains a question. What you find out here was that Orff did nothing during the Second World War to help anybody and after the war he lied about being part of the opposition. Orff was a coward, an opportunist and is very unimportant as a composer. If it were not for Carmina Burina we would have never heard of him.",2,Orff is a minor composer,1248134400,"07 21, 2009",2009,716,"['Why', 'did', 'Tony', 'Palmer', 'bother', 'Carl', 'Orff', 'Orff', 'only', 'one', 'real', 'great', 'work', 'Carmina', 'Burana', 'rest', 'work', 'not', 'good', 'known', 'educational', 'work', 'noted', 'here', 'there', 'were', 'other', 'greater', 'composers', 'Hindemith', 'made', 'important', 'contributions', 'education', 'music', 'Palmer', 'be', 'interested', 'not', 'Orff', 'was', 'sympathetic', 'Third', 'Reich', 'question', 'What', 'find', 'out', 'here', 'was', 'Orff', 'did', 'nothing', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'help', 'anybody', 'war', 'lied', 'being', 'part', 'opposition', 'Orff', 'was', 'coward', 'opportunist', 'very', 'unimportant', 'composer', 'were', 'not', 'Carmina', 'Burina', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'heard']","Tony Palmer's Film of O, Fortuna"
