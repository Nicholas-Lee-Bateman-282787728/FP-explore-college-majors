1604684,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B00A2H9VKG,Allan M. Lees,"[0, 1]","Matt Damon is good looking. So, he's a Hollywood actor - good looks being the prerequisite for success in this field. He seems like a nice guy off-screen. On-screen he plays nice guys. So... the audience can identify with him. The script for this movie is about a nice guy. A nice guy working for a bad company (think global energy corporation). Now here's where it gets tricky if you haven't yet switched off your brain: Americans consume vast amounts of energy. Houses are not insulated so they need to be heated in winter and cooled in summer. Vehicles are big an inefficient so they drink huge amounts of gasoline. Cities have buildings with lights that are left on 24 hours per day. All in all, Americans guzzle energy as if there was no tomorrow.But... Big Energy Corporations - the ones that provide all the energy Americans like to squander - are BAD. Enron, Exxon, all the rest. And fracking (the means whereby hydrocarbons are extracted from shale and other rocks) is very bad.So here's the movie: old-style farming communities are being targeted by Big Energy because under the farmland lies abundant natural gas and shale oil. Sometimes the extraction of this energy (which we all want, remember...) can be environmentally damaging. Maybe not as damaging as the dirty coal and oil we already burn, but hey, that stuff comes from far-away countries and we don't care much about pollution there, right? Or it comes from dirty American mines but... who wants to put American miners out of business? Even if the product is filthy. But we should care about pollution down on the farm because it might ruin the flavor of mom's apple pie (which actually is Sara Lee but who's counting...). Hmmm... seems a bit confusing so far.So this very odd little movie is about, what, exactly? That it's bad to risk polluting American farm land in order to satisfy American demand for energy? That no risk, however slight, is acceptable at home but it's OK for other countries to get polluted if that's what it takes to keep American cars on the road, American buildings air-conditioned?In the end the Damon character, who has been working for Big Energy, realizes his error and retreats to the farm. A farm totally reliant on expensive and market-distorting government subsidies.And this is the moral of the story.In other words, if you're not already in a coma, it may be best to avoid this movie because really it is quite confused and very infantile.Which is a shame because Hollywood doesn't make very many movies that attempt to be about real issues. The last thing we need is a fiasco that even a fifth-grade student would re-write in order to make more coherent before filming commenced.So, Matt, in the unlikely event that you ever read this, please put brain into gear before making an ""issue"" movie next time, OK? Because you do seem like a nice guy. But nice movies have to possess at least a modicum of intellectual coherence. Otherwise what's the point?",3,Aimless and Pointless,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,2960,"['Matt', 'Damon', 'good', 'looking', 'So', 'Hollywood', 'actor', 'good', 'looks', 'being', 'prerequisite', 'success', 'field', 'nice', 'guy', 'off-screen', 'On-screen', 'nice', 'guys', 'So', 'audience', 'can', 'identify', 'script', 'movie', 'nice', 'guy', 'nice', 'guy', 'working', 'bad', 'company', 'think', 'global', 'energy', 'corporation', 'Now', 'here', 'where', 'tricky', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'switched', 'off', 'brain', 'Americans', 'consume', 'vast', 'amounts', 'energy', 'Houses', 'are', 'not', 'insulated', 'so', 'need', 'be', 'heated', 'winter', 'cooled', 'summer', 'Vehicles', 'are', 'big', 'inefficient', 'drink', 'huge', 'amounts', 'gasoline', 'Cities', 'have', 'buildings', 'lights', 'are', 'left', '24', 'hours', 'day', 'Americans', 'guzzle', 'energy', 'was', 'tomorrow.But', 'Big', 'Energy', 'Corporations', 'ones', 'provide', 'energy', 'Americans', 'squander', 'are', 'BAD', 'Enron', 'Exxon', 'rest', 'fracking', 'means', 'whereby', 'hydrocarbons', 'are', 'extracted', 'shale', 'other', 'rocks', 'very', 'bad.So', 'here', 'movie', 'old-style', 'farming', 'communities', 'are', 'being', 'targeted', 'Big', 'Energy', 'farmland', 'abundant', 'natural', 'gas', 'shale', 'oil', 'Sometimes', 'extraction', 'energy', 'want', 'remember', 'can', 'be', 'environmentally', 'damaging', 'Maybe', 'not', 'as', 'damaging', 'dirty', 'coal', 'oil', 'already', 'burn', 'hey', 'stuff', 'far-away', 'countries', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'pollution', 'there', 'right', 'dirty', 'American', 'mines', 'who', 'put', 'American', 'miners', 'business', 'Even', 'product', 'filthy', 'should', 'care', 'pollution', 'down', 'farm', 'might', 'ruin', 'flavor', 'mom', 'apple', 'pie', 'actually', 'Sara', 'Lee', 'who', 'counting', 'bit', 'confusing', 'so', 'far.So', 'very', 'odd', 'little', 'movie', 'about', 'what', 'exactly', 'bad', 'risk', 'polluting', 'American', 'farm', 'land', 'order', 'satisfy', 'American', 'demand', 'energy', 'risk', 'however', 'slight', 'acceptable', 'home', 'OK', 'other', 'countries', 'get', 'polluted', 'what', 'keep', 'American', 'cars', 'road', 'American', 'buildings', 'air-conditioned', 'end', 'Damon', 'character', 'who', 'been', 'working', 'Big', 'Energy', 'error', 'retreats', 'farm', 'farm', 'totally', 'reliant', 'expensive', 'market-distorting', 'government', 'subsidies.And', 'moral', 'story.In', 'other', 'words', ""'re"", 'not', 'already', 'coma', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'avoid', 'movie', 'really', 'quite', 'confused', 'very', 'infantile.Which', 'shame', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'make', 'very', 'many', 'movies', 'attempt', 'be', 'real', 'issues', 'last', 'thing', 'need', 'fiasco', 'even', 'fifth-grade', 'student', 'would', 're-write', 'order', 'make', 'more', 'coherent', 'filming', 'commenced.So', 'Matt', 'unlikely', 'event', 'ever', 'read', 'please', 'put', 'brain', 'gear', 'making', 'issue', 'movie', 'next', 'time', 'OK', 'do', 'seem', 'nice', 'guy', 'nice', 'movies', 'have', 'possess', 'least', 'modicum', 'intellectual', 'coherence', 'Otherwise', 'what', 'point']",N/A

1604690,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00A2H9VKG,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","Promised Land wins for me solely on the fact it takes place in a small town out in the country, an ideal location to tell a story if I do say so!  Matt Damon and Frances McDormand play the role of gas company salesmen who venture out to said small town in hopes of getting on everyone's good side when they reveal to the townspeople that they can make millions by letting Matt Damon's company drill through the soil on their property.  At first they seem excited and surprised however the people of THIS small town are no fools- they'd rather stay poor if it means keeping their land intact.  They don't trust some fancy sales person from the city anyway.  Can't blame 'em!  Some of the townspeople are especially knowledgeable and question Matt Damon's logic.  This is when the film picks up.This movie is incredibly slow for the first 30 minutes until a certain Matt Damon speech in a high school, and later when another character (a competitor of Damon's) by the name of John Krasinski reveals news that animals would probably die during the drilling when chemicals are released.  This is when the writing finally gets off the ground.  You can expect typical cliched writing throughout the film, however these type of small town movies are usually enticing enough to receive high enough ratings from me personally and this is no exception.  I'm not entirely sure why that is.  This is basically Erin Brockovich in almost every single piece of writing, however it's not nearly as funny, charismatic or interesting and feels like a minor copycat.Promised Land probably succeeds because the writers picked top notch actors and actressess in Matt Damon, John Krasinski and Frances McDormand so any flaws are usually short and pointless.  The acting itself is wonderful too- Matt Damon plays a convincing salesperson who believes he's doing the right thing, Frances McDormand is sharp and perky who's never shy with a witty remark and is quite an underrated character in my opinion, and John Krasinski is cheerful and honest in an overconfident kind of way, so we really don't like him (even though he pretends to be the one who's morally correct and for a while actually convinces me he's not that bad of a guy!)I could have sworn the soundtrack was dominated with Simon & Garfunkel tracks, but apparently these songs are actually written and sung by a musician named Danny Elfman, who sounds identical to Paul Simon.  So THAT'S why none of these ""Simon & Garfunkel"" songs sounded familiar, haha. Great music all the same.The one thing that makes sitting through Promised Land worth your time if you're out there reading this and still not sold on the storyline, is that there's a couple major twists along the way.  One HUGE twist involving John Krasinski's character.  That's definitely a can't miss moment.  Also the ending is pretty confusing because it doesn't wrap up the storyline in a clear and logical way so I'm not really sure if the land is going to be drilled or not.  Without spoiling what happens, the conclusion just isn't clear to me.Highly recommended, but the movie is nothing particularly creative or thought-provoking.  In fact the writing is fairly standard and though the story is quite easy to follow, that doesn't automatically make it a slam dunk.  It's somewhat cliched and uninteresting occasionally so be prepared for these shortcomings.",4,false promises,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,3365,"['Promised', 'Land', 'wins', 'solely', 'fact', 'place', 'small', 'town', 'country', 'ideal', 'location', 'tell', 'story', 'do', 'say', 'so', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'play', 'role', 'gas', 'company', 'salesmen', 'who', 'venture', 'said', 'small', 'town', 'hopes', 'getting', 'everyone', 'good', 'side', 'when', 'reveal', 'townspeople', 'can', 'make', 'millions', 'letting', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'company', 'soil', 'property', 'first', 'seem', 'excited', 'surprised', 'however', 'people', 'THIS', 'small', 'town', 'are', 'fools-', ""'d"", 'rather', 'stay', 'poor', 'keeping', 'land', 'intact', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'fancy', 'sales', 'person', 'city', 'anyway', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'townspeople', 'are', 'especially', 'knowledgeable', 'question', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'logic', 'when', 'film', 'up.This', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'slow', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'certain', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'speech', 'high', 'school', 'later', 'when', 'character', 'competitor', 'Damon', 'name', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'news', 'animals', 'would', 'probably', 'die', 'drilling', 'when', 'chemicals', 'are', 'released', 'when', 'writing', 'finally', 'ground', 'can', 'expect', 'typical', 'cliched', 'writing', 'film', 'however', 'type', 'small', 'town', 'movies', 'are', 'usually', 'enticing', 'enough', 'receive', 'high', 'enough', 'ratings', 'personally', 'exception', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'why', 'basically', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'almost', 'single', 'piece', 'writing', 'however', 'not', 'nearly', 'funny', 'charismatic', 'interesting', 'feels', 'minor', 'copycat.Promised', 'Land', 'probably', 'writers', 'picked', 'top', 'notch', 'actors', 'actressess', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'flaws', 'are', 'usually', 'short', 'pointless', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'too-', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'convincing', 'salesperson', 'who', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'sharp', 'perky', 'who', 'never', 'shy', 'witty', 'remark', 'quite', 'underrated', 'character', 'opinion', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'cheerful', 'honest', 'overconfident', 'kind', 'way', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'even', 'be', 'one', 'who', 'morally', 'correct', 'while', 'actually', 'not', 'bad', 'guy', 'could', 'have', 'sworn', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'dominated', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'tracks', 'apparently', 'songs', 'are', 'actually', 'written', 'sung', 'musician', 'named', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'who', 'identical', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'why', 'none', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'songs', 'sounded', 'familiar', 'haha', 'Great', 'music', 'same.The', 'one', 'thing', 'sitting', 'Promised', 'Land', 'time', ""'re"", 'there', 'reading', 'still', 'not', 'sold', 'storyline', 'couple', 'major', 'twists', 'way', 'One', 'HUGE', 'twist', 'involving', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'character', 'definitely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'moment', 'Also', 'ending', 'pretty', 'confusing', ""n't"", 'wrap', 'up', 'storyline', 'clear', 'logical', 'way', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'land', 'going', 'be', 'drilled', 'not', 'spoiling', 'what', 'conclusion', 'just', ""n't"", 'clear', 'me.Highly', 'recommended', 'movie', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'creative', 'thought-provoking', 'fact', 'writing', 'fairly', 'standard', 'story', 'quite', 'easy', 'follow', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'make', 'slam', 'dunk', 'somewhat', 'cliched', 'uninteresting', 'occasionally', 'so', 'be', 'prepared', 'shortcomings']",N/A

Not that I need to tell you how it ends, but towards the end, the Grinch had a change of heart -- after all, his heart grew three sizes that day -- and he returned all the toys back to Whoville.  Oh, and he joined hands with all the Whos and sang Kumbaya.  Or at least &#34;Abu dore, fabu fore. . . .&#34;Then in 2012, Matt Damon -- a mean guy who works for a large energy firm -- couldn't care less about a small Pennsylvania town, so he got in his car, headed there and. . . .Oh, I don't need to tell you how it ends, because you already know the story.  You've seen it a thousand times really, at least once if you watched &#34;The Grinch,&#34; which everyone has.  Without giving anything away, however, there is one twist here that almost made this film interesting.  And I will admit, that twist was mildly surprising.But what's even more surprising to me:  someone like Mr. Damon -- who wrote the near perfect screenplay for &#34;Good Will Hunting&#34; (GWH) going on nearly two decades ago -- also wrote this one.  Perhaps more surprisingly still, quality actors such as Hal Holbrook and Frances McDormand still signed on to this film, even after reading the script.  (They did read the script, didn't they?  Or did they just assume that this would be another GWH?)To be fair, though, I hate to rip on this film, because I am a pretty big fan of Mr. Damon.

I shall elaborate further on this reasoning.Promised Land is a softee environmental skew on the problem with the spread of the natural gas industry. The movie presents it in a fairly easy way to understand, demonstrating it in a 'show me' and not 'tell me' method which I found quite interesting. The movie was very well written, and almost had you rooting for both sides at one point.In the film, two representatives from Global power are sent to a small farm town to try and sell their company by buying up the land for drilling rights. We are presented with the pros and cons of the drilling, or fracking, throughout the movie in a variety of ways so that the audience is well versed in the process so as to make their decision on whether it is a good or bad thing. On one hand, natural gas is a great alternative to the current fuel resources. Also, they pay well for whatever may be uncovered. On the other hand, the process can be dangerous to the land, and destroy any potential use for the land after it has been drilled. On top of this, the natural gas companies tend to 'bulldoze' through, buying up in an almost hostile way whatever they want. The audience is definitely left to decide. While they may seem on your side, are they truly looking out for your best interest?The movie presents the gas companies as dirty, greedy businessmen who will use any tactics or options at their disposal, up to and not limited to bribery of city or local government officials, and the ever-so adversarial ecological groups that seek to protect the environment. This definitely painted them badly, no matter how you try to view it.I enjoyed the movie and its given complexity throughout. I had some issues with the ending, as I felt it grew confused at parts. Firstly, (spoiler) the environmental expert was parading around, trashing global's name and slandering their image, but actually turned out to be working for them? I find the methods he used slightly illogical, seeing as how all that was not necessary simply to pose a false picture of a ruined farmland. This could have been masqueraded so much easier. I just find it unrealistic.Also, (spoiler) we are given the main character Steven, a salesman/ executive for the company, that suddenly has a change of heart at the movie, and decided that his company really is evil in his last speech. From all that has happened to him, and all he has seen, this guy most likely pulling in $100K+ / year decided that he cannot do it anymore, and it turns out that his own company has defeated him. He pulls all the stops and admits to the town that it was all a hoax perpetrated by Global, and they simply did it all to gain their votes. It is almost like Matt Damon's true liberal self could not have it any other way, and decided it had to happen. It is not that I disliked the movie, or the ending; I simply found it to be unbelievable.Do I recommend this movie? Yes. Besides some unrealistic points, I greatly enjoyed the characters, story, and general theme they were trying to promote, as well as a certain information, if not educational theme, throughout. I give 3.5 stars because I sort of liked it, but it was definitely better than okay.",3,"A decent film with good writing, a great cast, and confused plotlines",1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,3278,"['preface', 'review', 'wish', 'had', 'option', 'give', '3.5', 'stars', 'none', 'existed', 'shall', 'elaborate', 'further', 'reasoning.Promised', 'Land', 'softee', 'environmental', 'skew', 'problem', 'spread', 'natural', 'gas', 'industry', 'movie', 'fairly', 'easy', 'way', 'understand', 'demonstrating', ""'show"", 'not', ""'tell"", 'method', 'found', 'quite', 'interesting', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'almost', 'had', 'rooting', 'sides', 'one', 'point.In', 'film', 'two', 'representatives', 'Global', 'power', 'are', 'sent', 'small', 'farm', 'town', 'try', 'sell', 'company', 'buying', 'up', 'land', 'drilling', 'rights', 'are', 'presented', 'pros', 'cons', 'drilling', 'fracking', 'movie', 'variety', 'ways', 'audience', 'well', 'versed', 'process', 'so', 'make', 'decision', 'good', 'bad', 'thing', 'one', 'hand', 'natural', 'gas', 'great', 'alternative', 'current', 'fuel', 'resources', 'Also', 'pay', 'well', 'may', 'be', 'uncovered', 'other', 'hand', 'process', 'can', 'be', 'dangerous', 'land', 'destroy', 'potential', 'use', 'land', 'been', 'drilled', 'top', 'natural', 'gas', 'companies', 'tend', ""'bulldoze"", 'buying', 'up', 'almost', 'hostile', 'way', 'want', 'audience', 'definitely', 'left', 'decide', 'may', 'seem', 'side', 'are', 'truly', 'looking', 'out', 'best', 'interest', 'movie', 'gas', 'companies', 'dirty', 'greedy', 'businessmen', 'who', 'will', 'use', 'tactics', 'options', 'disposal', 'up', 'not', 'limited', 'bribery', 'city', 'local', 'government', 'officials', 'ever-so', 'adversarial', 'ecological', 'groups', 'seek', 'protect', 'environment', 'definitely', 'painted', 'badly', 'matter', 'how', 'try', 'view', 'it.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'given', 'complexity', 'had', 'issues', 'ending', 'felt', 'grew', 'confused', 'parts', 'Firstly', 'spoiler', 'environmental', 'expert', 'was', 'parading', 'around', 'trashing', 'global', 'name', 'slandering', 'image', 'actually', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'working', 'find', 'methods', 'used', 'slightly', 'illogical', 'seeing', 'how', 'was', 'not', 'necessary', 'simply', 'pose', 'false', 'picture', 'ruined', 'farmland', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'masqueraded', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'just', 'find', 'unrealistic.Also', 'spoiler', 'are', 'given', 'main', 'character', 'Steven', 'salesman/', 'executive', 'company', 'suddenly', 'change', 'heart', 'movie', 'decided', 'company', 'really', 'evil', 'last', 'speech', 'happened', 'seen', 'guy', 'most', 'likely', 'pulling', '100K+', '/', 'year', 'decided', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'anymore', 'out', 'own', 'company', 'defeated', 'stops', 'admits', 'town', 'was', 'hoax', 'perpetrated', 'Global', 'simply', 'did', 'gain', 'votes', 'almost', 'like', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'true', 'liberal', 'self', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'other', 'way', 'decided', 'had', 'happen', 'not', 'disliked', 'movie', 'ending', 'simply', 'found', 'be', 'unbelievable.Do', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Yes', 'unrealistic', 'points', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'characters', 'story', 'general', 'theme', 'were', 'trying', 'promote', 'as', 'well', 'certain', 'information', 'not', 'educational', 'theme', 'give', '3.5', 'stars', 'sort', 'liked', 'was', 'definitely', 'better', 'okay']",N/A

1604717,A2GPLOLLE6BUDT,B00A2H9VKG,Dave,"[0, 5]","Ignoring the Hollywood bandwagon riding of environmental concerns about fracking and evil greedy corporations, I enjoyed this film for its story and interesting twist at its conclusion.  The story was about farmers in a small economically depressed town and their need or desire for money beyond what they could earn from farming.  To keep their farms and to maintain or improve their way of life, many are tempted by two marketers from a gas company to lease their land for gas exploration and drilling for a per acre rent of $2,000 and a negotiated percentage of up to 18% of the revenue generated from any gas produced.  Thus with an incalculable probability of becoming wealthy, leasing their land was initially viewed as an attractive proposition until a retired engineer and local high school science teacher pointed out environmental consequences of drilling, including problems associated with fracking.  A seemingly extroverted environmentalist shows up in town at the same time telling horror stories about fracking and how it caused the contamination of his family's farm rendering it unfit for farming and animal habitation.  He distributed flyers and staked yards with posters, both with pictures of dead cows as evidence to support his story.  The rest of the film details the battle of the marketers versus the science teacher and environmentalist for the hearts of the farmers.  A crooked politician was thrown in for good measure.  I will not give away the ending.While I enjoyed the story, acting and filming, I could not help becoming a bit annoyed with the misrepresentations by those who had an interest in the specific outcome of whether drilling would be accepted or rejected.  Such misrepresentations from both sides were sometimes presented as facts giving the impression that the viewer could learn something about both sides of the argument.  This may have been necessary for the story to appear to be a reasonable discussion of the dilemma facing those with a decision concerning the lease of their land, but it was far from an objective or informative presentation.  Those who ""feel"" they have learned something from this Hollywood fictionalization should consider whether they ""think"" they have learned anything as it may be difficult to avoid being unduly influenced in either direction by viewing the film.  I only add the caution because several other reviewers seem to have a misplaced confidence in the objectivity of Hollywood.  I recognize that fracking has some level of risk that must be evaluated by those taking the risk, but also that corporations cannot by nature be evil or greedy.

1604718,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B00A2H9VKG,David R. Eastwood,"[6, 8]","FRACKING IS ONE OF at least 57 issues that sharply divide our country today. Obviously huge money is being made with it, and as most people already know (and the film doesn't mention) Vice President Dick Cheney arranged for frackers to have a Get-Out-of-Jail-Free card before he left office.PROMISED LAND (whose title has at least five different meanings, some secular and others with religious connotations) is NOT a film that was scripted, produced, and marketed to entertain people. Instead, it is a ""film with an argument,"" a piece of ""Deliberative Rhetoric"" that presents a case against fracking so that its viewers will support anti-fracking politicians in Congress and in their state legislatures.Matt Damon stars as a young man working for a large gas company, who travels to rural areas in the U.S. that are believed to contain substantial deposits of natural gas under them. With the help of an older woman (played well by Frances McDormand) he gets farmers to sell the rights to whatever gas is under their land. For much of the film his efforts in one community are opposed by an elderly school teacher (played by Hal Holbrook) and a young ""environmentalist"" (played by John Krasinski, who also co-scripted the film with Damon). And at the end not just one but TWO major plot twists occur ... which some viewers who are savvy about how scripts are written and how foreshadowing elements are planted in them will foresee at least half an hour earlier. The final few minutes will be mildly touching to some viewers but not much more to anyone.PROMISED LAND is purposely low-keyed most of the time and is probably not going to change the minds of anyone who is pro-fracking, though it probably will give comfort to those who are already against it, and it just might cause a few million ""undecideds"" to think about getting more information on the Internet.A good cast does a good, competent job, but their script does not give them the material to do a great job.

It centers around a ladder climber at a company called Global Crosspower Solutions, an energy company which deals in natural gas. He goes to a small town with his partner (Frances McDormand) in order to get the town to sign over rights so that his company may begin fracking for natural gas. He is surprised when he encounters resistance from the townsfolk, who are aided by an environmentalist with an axe to grind (Krasinski).Should you buy it? At times the film can be a bit preachy. It's a well told story, with a couple of nice twists and ultimately a nice little character study. There are political undertones both overt and subtle which astute viewers can pick up on but which aren't 100% necessary to understand the very basic plot. I found it to be an enjoyable film with strong performances and quite a bit of witty banter. Overall, I'd recommend it as a purchase if you're a fan of character pieces and films that deal with complex real world issues. If not, this might be a firm ""rent"" movie.

1604735,A24PMZJF0LHGCW,B00A2H9VKG,Gilby Mitnick III Jr.,"[8, 21]","If there's anything better than Ben Affleck, then it's only Matt Damon. Am I right, folks, or am I right? Whaddya say, huh? Am I close? Hot or cold?? Well...anything???Anyhoo, I am a super-fan of Matt Damon, having been one since I first laid eyes on him in his performance in Good Dill Bunting, which is a little-known, debut vehicle of his. I have become an even bigger super-fan of this awe-inspiring thespian since he got insanely more political in his movie roles and totally inappropriate bouts of outspoken verbal diarrhea, especially since the GW Bush presidency. I utterly believe--and you can take this to the bank, I dare say--that Promised Land (which I originally thought was a religious-conversion movie for born-again Xtians) is Damon's finest political movie. That assertion alone, folks, should be more than enough to get yourselves off of your derrieres and straight into a theater near you, even though you probably are either unemployed or working a whole lot less because of Obama's ruinous, economic policies.Anyway, Promised Land is about fracking--that is fracking, not effing, you immature people out there--which is a colloquial term for extracting raw sewage from the earth or ground. Damon's political stance is that fracking--again, that's fracking and not effing, in case any immature people want to make naughty jokes about it!--is dangerous and hurtful to communities all over this great piece of land we call the U.S. of A (although it's less great now that Obama has sowed his seeds in it for 4 years). In fact, Promised Land is loosely based--like all very accurate and scientifically substantiated Hollywood movies that are always being produced by the industry--on a real-life fracking incident that occurred in a small town in Puerto Rico. Since Damon is not just the finest thespian who ever waited tables, but also a meticulous researcher who always gets his facts always 110 percent correct, it is not surprising at all that he was successful in totally misrepresenting the events surrounding the story by Dave Eggers.Basically, the story tells of Damon, who is a corporate salesman attempting to purchase the raw sewage-drilling rights from the ill-educated hicks of a rural town located in the backwards backwoods of central Illinois. While he first thinks fracking is the bee's knees, as it were, he soon learns that this apparently cheap approach to extracting raw sewage out of the ground for energy purposes is anything but safe. For instance, in the film, there is the pivotal scene where raw sewage keeps exploding all over Damon's face for a good 122 seconds, non-stop! I mean, if that does not wake America up to the absolute perils of fracking, not effing, then I don't know what will. You feel me, playa? Aight.I also have to say that this movie is highly credible, in spite of evil conservatives and their slanders against Damon for somehow fabricating parts of this very accurate film to make liberal political points.

1604738,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00A2H9VKG,Grady Harp,"[23, 29]","Interesting to note all the negative reviews for PROMISED LAND. Perhaps that is because people expected some big explosion of a story when all that is here is a bit of everyday happenings that accompany this country's struggle with environmental issues. It is a quiet film, exceedingly well written based on a story from Dave Eggers, by Matt Damon and Jon Krasinski who happen to also star in their brainchild - an honest, funny, entertaining, and sensitive tale in the way it plays out the issues and comes up with a surprise ending.Corporate salesman for Global Enterprises Steve Butler (Matt Damon) arrives in a rural Pennsylvania town with his sales partner, Sue Thomason (Frances McDormand, in one of the finest performances in the film): the two enjoy a warmly written and quite unassuming relationship. Global is a company that drills (read `fracks') for natural gas as alternative fuel form to replace the degrading effects of oil and gasoline on the environment. With the town having been hit hard by the economic decline of recent years, Steve and Sue see the local citizens as likely to accept their company's offer, for drilling rights to their properties, as much-needed relief. What seems like an easy job for the duo becomes complicated by the objection of a respected MIT trained physicist and schoolteacher (Hal Holbrook) and with support from a grassroots campaign led by a newly arrived likeable environmentalist Dustin Noble (Jon Krasinski) who counters Steve both personally and professionally. Some small town influences enter in the form of personal affairs: Steve is smitten by testy schoolteacher Alice (Rosemarie DeWitt) while Sue is attracted to shop owner Rob (Titus Welliver). Once Dustin smooth talks the town and places signs of dead cows on posters that cry out Global Go Home! the war is on. But the town, torn between needing money and fear of heir farms being destroyed by fracking, is the foil, and the ending of the story is a surprise.Gus Van Sant directs with his leisurely homespun style and draws excellent performances from his cast - including some fine cameos by Dorothy Silver, Lucas Black, and Kristin Slaysman among many others.  PROMISED LAND gives us both sides of the environmental problem and we, the audience, are left to decide for ourselves.  This is a much-underrated move whose impact will grow with time.

To educate we the viewers, Hal Holbrook is here as the local science teacher who stands up to read his script listing all the evils of fracking.The film would not be complete without a love triangle, and it's presented here starring Damon, a sweet teacher (Rosemarie Dewitt), and Krasinski as the environmentalist who shows up to sabotage the natural gas company represented by Damon.By the time the film is 95% over, if you have any lingering doubts as to whether fracking = evil, the point will be further hammered home by a last minute (and genuinely surprising but completely unnecessary) twist.",3,Promised Land of Cliches,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,1534,"['enjoy', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'actors', 'seem', 'good', 'guys', 'real', 'lives', 'not', 'only', 'star', 'Promised', 'Land', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'as', 'well', 'wanted', 'like', 'film', 'aside', 'two', 'nice', 'guys', 'doing', 'typically', 'good', 'acting', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'here', 'messages', 'delivered', 'subtlety', 'sledgehammer', 'are', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'levels', 'hysteria', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'are', 'shades', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'film', 'based', 'John', 'Grisham', 'novel', 'John', 'Grisham', 'Rainmaker', 'also', 'incidentally', 'starring', 'Damon', 'other', 'words', 'big', 'industry', 'bad', 'small-town', 'simple', 'folk', '=', 'good', 'room', 'nuances', 'here.Even', 'know', 'nothing', 'controversy', 'involving', 'fracking', 'process', 'obtaining', 'natural', 'gas', 'rocks', 'underground', 'mystery', 'outset', 'position', 'film', 'will', 'take', 'educate', 'viewers', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'here', 'local', 'science', 'teacher', 'who', 'up', 'read', 'script', 'listing', 'evils', 'fracking.The', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'complete', 'love', 'triangle', 'presented', 'here', 'starring', 'Damon', 'sweet', 'teacher', 'Rosemarie', 'Dewitt', 'Krasinski', 'environmentalist', 'who', 'up', 'sabotage', 'natural', 'gas', 'company', 'represented', 'Damon.By', 'time', 'film', '95', '%', 'have', 'lingering', 'doubts', 'fracking', '=', 'evil', 'point', 'will', 'be', 'further', 'hammered', 'home', 'last', 'minute', 'genuinely', 'surprising', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'twist']",N/A

Damon plays Steve who is an aggressive, lowballing salesman for a natural gas company whose specialty is fracking. While traveling rural Pennsylvania to lease land, Steve begins to encounter resistance from a town divided before he even gets there. At times, the Steve character reminds me of the political candidate Damon played in The Adjustment Bureau. A young man fueled by advancement who displays what appears to be honest, small town values when put on the spot by public outcry. As soon as the town wants the presence of the fracking company to be put to a vote, Steve loses leverage again when an influential environmentalist (John Krasinski) arrives unannounced. The clash between the environmentalist and the salesman is the best part of the movie. While half the town is anxiously signing land contracts faster than they can buy a lotto ticket, the skeptics who have farmed the land for generations don't want to be the generation that destroys the habitat. Steve doesn't understand the stubbornness of the opposition while he clearly shows the he is hurting personally by their lack of acceptance. In a related, real-life story: On May 8, 2013, citizens of Youngstown, Ohio voted DOWN a ban on fracking (and any activity relating to shale drilling) by a margin of 57% to 43%.

1604761,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00A2H9VKG,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Well this was... different. Promised Land is another one of those films that I knew almost nothing about going in, but, for me, Damon is one of those actors who knows how to deliver no matter what role he's in. Sadly, I found that there wasn't much to enjoy in Promised Land and throughout most of the film I kind of found myself bored.Promised Land follows the story of two employees of Global Crosspower Solutions, an energy company that goes from place to place looking to obtain the natural gas trapped underground through fracking. These two employees are Steve Butler (Damon) and his partner Sue Thomason (Frances McDormand). Butler has built a reputation on being able to get in and out of his location in a matter of days persuading the residents to agree at an extremely low cost.Unfortunately, their stay in Pennsylvania becomes longer than expected as Frank Yates (Hal Brook) manages to inform a good chunk of the town about just how dangerous fracking can be to the environment. Their situation only becomes worse as Dustin Noble (John Krasinski), a worker for an unknown environmental firm, comes through town informing even more people about the dangers of this process.To be quite honest the only thing I found truly worthwhile about this movie was the fact that it showed both sides of the argument. There are those who are for fracking and those who are against it. Neither side is necessarily right because both have their positives and their negatives. What annoyed me the most was that the entire thing just felt stale and lifeless. I'm sure even environmental enthusiasts who see this won't leave with their opinions swayed because their minds are already made up. So what was the point?On the surface they had the right idea. I think their main goal was to educate the viewers on this controversial topic, but anyone who's taken a science class before already knows about this. We've already heard both sides of the argument countless times before so, once again, what was the point? No matter how many times I roll this thing around in my head I can't find one. Then in a last-ditch effort to make the experience worthwhile everything leads up to a plot twist that feels both anticlimactic and unnecessary.The film isn't a total disaster, however. Matt Damon gave another Matt Damon performance, take that as you will, and the supporting cast all gave enjoyable performances as well. Nothing Oscar worthy, but I've seen worse. The film's score, provided by Danny Elfman, wasn't bad either. Actually, it might have been my favorite thing from the entire movie.Overall Score: 5.5/10 - Promised Land is one of those films that knows where it wants to go, but it has a hard time getting there. The story's execution definitely could have been better and I would've liked to see some of the characters get fleshed out a little more. This might be a movie aimed more towards the environmental enthusiasts so if you consider yourself part of that demographic then I would say go ahead and see it. For the rest of you I would say make this a rental. There's no guarantee you'll enjoy it, but at least you won't be paying the full retail price to see it.",3,5.5/10 - Very bland,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,3217,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.Well', 'was', 'different', 'Promised', 'Land', 'one', 'films', 'knew', 'almost', 'nothing', 'going', 'Damon', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'how', 'deliver', 'matter', 'what', 'role', 'Sadly', 'found', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'enjoy', 'Promised', 'Land', 'most', 'film', 'kind', 'found', 'bored.Promised', 'Land', 'story', 'two', 'employees', 'Global', 'Crosspower', 'Solutions', 'energy', 'company', 'place', 'place', 'looking', 'obtain', 'natural', 'gas', 'trapped', 'fracking', 'two', 'employees', 'are', 'Steve', 'Butler', 'Damon', 'partner', 'Sue', 'Thomason', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Butler', 'built', 'reputation', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'location', 'matter', 'days', 'persuading', 'residents', 'agree', 'extremely', 'low', 'cost.Unfortunately', 'stay', 'Pennsylvania', 'becomes', 'longer', 'expected', 'Frank', 'Yates', 'Hal', 'Brook', 'inform', 'good', 'chunk', 'town', 'about', 'just', 'how', 'dangerous', 'fracking', 'can', 'be', 'environment', 'situation', 'only', 'worse', 'Dustin', 'Noble', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'worker', 'unknown', 'environmental', 'firm', 'town', 'informing', 'even', 'more', 'people', 'dangers', 'process.To', 'be', 'quite', 'only', 'thing', 'found', 'truly', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'was', 'fact', 'showed', 'sides', 'argument', 'are', 'who', 'are', 'fracking', 'who', 'are', 'side', 'necessarily', 'right', 'have', 'positives', 'negatives', 'What', 'annoyed', 'most', 'was', 'entire', 'thing', 'just', 'felt', 'stale', 'lifeless', ""'m"", 'sure', 'even', 'environmental', 'enthusiasts', 'who', 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'opinions', 'swayed', 'minds', 'are', 'already', 'made', 'up', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'surface', 'had', 'right', 'idea', 'think', 'main', 'goal', 'was', 'educate', 'viewers', 'controversial', 'topic', 'anyone', 'who', 'taken', 'science', 'class', 'already', ""'ve"", 'already', 'heard', 'sides', 'argument', 'countless', 'times', 'so', 'once', 'again', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'No', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'roll', 'thing', 'around', 'head', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'one', 'Then', 'last-ditch', 'effort', 'make', 'experience', 'worthwhile', 'everything', 'up', 'plot', 'twist', 'anticlimactic', 'unnecessary.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'total', 'disaster', 'however', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'gave', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'performance', 'take', 'will', 'supporting', 'cast', 'gave', 'enjoyable', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'Nothing', 'Oscar', 'worthy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'film', 'score', 'provided', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either', 'Actually', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'favorite', 'thing', 'entire', 'movie.Overall', 'Score', '5.5/10', 'Promised', 'Land', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'go', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'there', 'story', 'execution', 'definitely', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'see', 'characters', 'get', 'fleshed', 'out', 'little', 'more', 'might', 'be', 'movie', 'aimed', 'more', 'environmental', 'enthusiasts', 'so', 'consider', 'part', 'demographic', 'then', 'would', 'say', 'go', 'ahead', 'see', 'rest', 'would', 'say', 'make', 'rental', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'least', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'paying', 'full', 'retail', 'price', 'see']",N/A

It's also based on a story by Dave Eggers, but what I'm not sure.  It starts off slow with Steve (Matt Damon) and Sue (Frances McDormand) sent off to a small Pennsylvania farm town.  They work for Global Crosspower Solutions (a ""natural gas"" co.).  Their soul job is to try to get land owners to sell a portion of their land so that they can ""frack"" for gas.  So this plot is a political one.  But I thought it was well done in showing the choices the farm owners had to make.  The script and people felt real to me.There isn't much to like about Steve and Sue at the beginning.  They're there for what they think is just a job.  They're the door-to-door sales people.  The ones you'd slam the door on their face, well at least I would. lol.  But they did get me to like them as a person.  Not as a sales person.  I think I liked Frances's character the most.

Instead Damon stars and contributes to the screenplay along with co-star John Krasinski and Dave Eggers.  Damon plays Steve Butler, a guy from small town Iowa who has just been promoted to a big job at big gas.  Natural gas that is.  In likely his last ""field"" assignment he along with his partner, Sue (the always good Frances McDormand) are to finalize contracts to purchase drilling rights in a small town in rural Pennsylvania.Like many small towns, industry has left and the town and its residents are struggling financially.  The process looks fairly routine until an elderly science teacher from the high school (Hal Holbrook) speaks up at a town hall meeting about the danger of ""fracking,"" the methodology for extracting the gas deep under the surface.  An environmentalist also shows up (John Krasinski) with ""proof"" of how the drilling has the potential to damage their farms and property.Frankly the film plays it pretty even I thought for most of the running time.  Butler has a couple pretty good speeches about how towns are left to die without industry and how the gas rights can make them wealthy, giving them and their families a way out.  Still the final act brings up the curtain on the whole charade, which in my mind wasn't even necessary.

1604802,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00A2H9VKG,Paul Allaer,"[10, 20]","""The Promised Land"" (2012 release; 106 min.) brings the story of Steve Butler (played by Matt Damon), who works for Big Company and who, along with his co-worker Sue Thomason (played by Frances McDormand) goes from town to town to buy up land in search of natural gas by ways of ""fracking"" (i.e. hydraulic fracturing of the underlying rocks to release the gas). In this particular Western Pennsylvanis town, a local guy (played by Hal Holbrook) raises some pointed questions about the environmental risks of fracking, and as a result, the town decides to hold a vote in three weeks whether to allow Big Company to proceed. Steve and Sue are now trying to win the trust of the locals but then Dustin Noble (played by John Krasinski), an environmentalist, comes to town and campaigns against the fracking vote. Will the town allow fracking to move forward?Several comments: this movie has a BUNCH of big names attached to it, including director Gus Van Sant (reuniting with Matt Damon 15 years after ""Good Will Hunting""), Matt Damon and John Krasinksi, who not only star but also co-wrote and co-produced the movie, David Eggers (providing the story), and several fine actors and actresses. Yet despite all that, the movie is riddled with cliches and lacks any and all drama. I am myself indifferent about fracking, and I have no problem with the movie taking a clear stand (fracking = evil), but please bring the story in a manner that challenges me as a viewer, rather than talking down to the viewer. The first hour of the movie is almost unwatchable, to be honest, but things get a tiny bit better in the last 45 min. (with a plot twist near the end that I did not see coming, I'll give the movie that much credit and hence my 2 star rating instead of 1 star).There are a couple of positives to note: first and foremost, Rosemarie DeWitt provides one of the few sparkles as the local teacher who may fall for Steve (or is Dustin? find out!), I saw her most recently in the excellent indie pic ""Your Sister's Sister"" and she confirms again with this strong (if small) role. Second, the movie soundtrack is quite good, highlighted by three excellent songs from The Milk Carton Kids. Third, urr... Bottom line, this movie seems well-intended (although of course there is no ""black and white"" proof yet one way or another about the dangers of ""fracking"") but mostly falls flat (and I'm being mild). I see well over 100 movies in the theatres each year, and regretfully I have to tell you that ""Promised Land"" is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while.

1604820,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00A2H9VKG,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 2]","There are a number of actors that I trust to give a good performance in almost any movie, and Matt Damon belongs on that list. He's probably best known for playing Jason Bourne, and some of my friends are disappointed that he didn't want to play similar roles for the rest of his life. I thought he was great as Bourne, but my favorite performances came in The Departed, Good Will Hunting, and Rounders. He elevated flawed movies like The Adjustment Bureau, Hereafter, and We Bought a Zoo, and gave excellent performances in several titles that I haven't mentioned.Why do I like Damon?I like that he's versatile, but most of all, I admire his understated acting style. He doesn't try to take over a movie, and that makes his performances all the more realistic. If Damon hadn't been cast in Promised Land, I doubt that I would have ever seen it. It's good to see him team up again with Gus Van Sant, who directed him in Good Will Hunting.Promised Land is about the way in which a natural gas company, Global, attempts to convince a small farming community to sell land and allow it to be exploited for its natural resources. The people are poor and seem like easy targets. Steve Butler (Damon) and Sue Thomason (McDormand) are employed by Global to deliver their sales pitch. Butler grew up in a similar community and carries a lot of credibility as he visits the local farmers. He truly believes that it is in the best interests of the locals to accept Global's offer.Butler encounters local opposition in the form of Frank Yates, who is played convincingly by Hal Holbrook. Yates is a science teacher and he's been making use of Google to uncover the truth about natural gas. Apparently, there are plenty of risks involved, and not all towns prosper in the way that Butler has implied. Additional problems arise for Butler when environmentalist Dustin Noble (Krasinski) shows up with a tale of how natural gas exploitation ruined his community.There are a couple of unpredictable twists later in the story, but it would be wrong of me to reveal them here.It's rare to see a drama of this nature in modern cinema. There are no explosions or action sequences, and although there is a small romantic element, it's not the driving force in the story. So who is this movie for? Well, it would certainly hold your interest if you were a struggling farmer with the option of selling your land. However, I don't fall into that category, and I was engrossed by the story throughout.The movie tackles real issues and raises questions about who is good and who is evil. It provides moral dilemmas for its characters, and we see how they choose to resolve them.

Steve(Damon) is committed to his job of persuading small town people, small farmers,to sell the rights of their land for the drilling for natural gas, only because he came from a small town which died when the industry left.Steve thinks he&#8217;s there to bring benefits to the small farmers,who are living through hard times.They want to get their kids through college and this is the way.He is convinced that rural life cannot be sustained by agriculture alone.Steve has been picked by Global Crosspower Solutions to promote big business, smooth anxieties,tap into the yokel mindset,with evangelism.Steve is up against a local science teacher Frank Yates(Hal Holbrook),who has researched the topic,and knows they only go to the poor areas to exploit the deposits,and is sceptical about the effects of the fracking process.Steve also has environmental activist Dustin Noble(Krasinski),who has turned up with an axe to grind against Global,telling people fracking in his hometown led to the poisoning of farm animals and the destruction of the local economy.He&#8217;s seen improbably whipping up the folk in a bar with a rendering of Springsteen&#8217;s &#8216;Dancing in the Dark&#8217;.He also makes a beeline(and the moral highground) for local teacher Alice,whom Steve fancied.This is not a debate about fracking,but fracking is the Maguffin of the movie.Steve is essentially a decent guy(&#8220;I&#8217;m not a bad guy&#8221;),but he knows he&#8217;s sold himself to the corporation,and some locals in a bar attack his complacency,punching him.There is a Capraesque Local Hero aspect to this film,about a man trying to get into contact with his conscience,with perceived qualities of character.There&#8217;s a girl,Alice,who acts as a weathervane of affection between the two male adversaries.The nice-guy geniality shows fissures,as Noble gets under Steve&#8217;s skin more as he takes the bribe,only to deny it and send out flyers and signs to people&#8217;s properties and woos Alice.Damon and McDormand are wonderful in their roles as is Dewitt as Alice.The location cinematography in Pennsylvania is good and the gentle musical score is effective.But there are some strange plot twists and speeches at the end,that the film feels conflicted between polemics and storytelling,slipping into Capra-corn preachiness and a soft

Damon plays Steve Butler.  He's good at his job because he grew up in a similar small town and can relate to the people he meets.  As the film starts, Steve has just been promoted, and he's sent to another (unnamed) community in rural Pennsylvania expecting to wrap up sales in a few days.  However, he's underestimated this particular hamlet, and he finds himself battling the townspeople, an environmentalist (John Krasinski), and ultimately himself.The movie has a terrific pedigree - an Oscar-nominated director (Gus Van Sant), a story by an acclaimed hipster writer (Dave Eggers), and an Oscar-winning co-author (Damon writing along with Krasinski). Plus, the always amazing McDormand is along for the ride.  And the movie almost lives up to all of that, although it fell just short for me, with an ending that didn't match the movie's overall tone.  Nevertheless, there's much to like about ""Promised Land.""  Damon and McDormand make a fantastic and fully believable team, who find themselves in realistic yet funny situations as they try to woo the town.  The depictions of life in a rural area and the local people are pretty much spot on also.  Too often Hollywood movies populate small towns with the type of quirky, eccentric townspeople better suited for episodes of ""Green Acres.""Some audiences are going to take issue with ""Promised Land"" due to its somewhat dewy liberal politics, although I suspect that environmentalists may argue that it doesn't go far enough.  Therein lies it's charm for me - the movie does have an agenda, but it's unspooled in a (mostly) subtle manner, with compassionate and likeable characters on both sides of the green divide.  I found myself entertained more often than lectured to, which is the effect that a good 'issues' movie should have on its audience.",4,Frack that,1370995200,"06 12, 2013",2013,2018,"['Promised', 'Land', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'employees', 'energy', 'company', 'two', 'work', 'team', 'going', 'small', 'farming', 'communities', 'buying', 'land', 'order', 'drill', 'natural', 'gas', 'fracking', 'Damon', 'Steve', 'Butler', 'good', 'job', 'grew', 'up', 'similar', 'small', 'town', 'can', 'relate', 'people', 'film', 'Steve', 'just', 'been', 'promoted', 'sent', 'unnamed', 'community', 'rural', 'Pennsylvania', 'expecting', 'wrap', 'up', 'sales', 'few', 'days', 'However', 'underestimated', 'particular', 'hamlet', 'battling', 'townspeople', 'environmentalist', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'ultimately', 'himself.The', 'movie', 'terrific', 'pedigree', 'Oscar-nominated', 'director', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'story', 'acclaimed', 'hipster', 'writer', 'Dave', 'Eggers', 'Oscar-winning', 'co-author', 'Damon', 'writing', 'along', 'Krasinski', 'always', 'amazing', 'McDormand', 'along', 'ride', 'movie', 'almost', 'up', 'fell', 'just', 'short', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'movie', 'overall', 'tone', 'Nevertheless', 'much', 'like', 'Promised', 'Land', 'Damon', 'McDormand', 'make', 'fantastic', 'fully', 'believable', 'team', 'who', 'find', 'realistic', 'yet', 'funny', 'situations', 'try', 'woo', 'town', 'depictions', 'life', 'rural', 'area', 'local', 'people', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'spot', 'also', 'Too', 'often', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'populate', 'small', 'towns', 'type', 'quirky', 'eccentric', 'townspeople', 'better', 'suited', 'episodes', 'Green', 'Acres', 'audiences', 'are', 'going', 'take', 'issue', 'Promised', 'Land', 'due', 'somewhat', 'dewy', 'liberal', 'politics', 'suspect', 'environmentalists', 'may', 'argue', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'enough', 'Therein', 'charm', 'movie', 'have', 'agenda', 'unspooled', 'mostly', 'subtle', 'manner', 'compassionate', 'likeable', 'characters', 'sides', 'green', 'divide', 'found', 'entertained', 'more', 'often', 'lectured', 'effect', 'good', ""'issues"", 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'audience']",N/A
