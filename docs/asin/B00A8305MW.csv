Aiken ""social observer""","[3, 6]","The ""cure"" for Sasha's amnesia ,caused by the last battle,is,of course,a trip for all the girls and him to a hot springs spa. As he awoke from battle,our favorite sadist,Katja,convinced him that he is really a girl that was transformed into a boy by an evil witch.This series opens with everyone buck naked in the pool where they try to force Sasha to remember he is a male;this first episode is as stated by the cast,fan service.It is also one of the few episodes that has very little abuse of the girls nor of their breasts,except Hana ""enjoying"" Katja's tormenting. A god-awfully large woman,Big Mum,or,""Hell's Dairy Cow"", makes her first appearance and rates the girls' breasts. Thus,this collection starts.The story line proceeds from where it left off and new characters are introduced,including the Qwaser of Sodium,the earnest foe of Sasha,and poor Tomo is kidnapped and transformed into the embodiment of the Qwaser of Gold.The artwork remains first rate and the several mini-side arcs,such as the rich-girl and daughter of the present head master,Tsujidou Miyuri wanting to be a pop-hero,are well done and offer much of the comedy.There is,however,the continuing and pervasive excessive abuse of the girls. Those of us that like a measure nudity understand and like the idea boobs are not ala carte';there is a girl attached to them and her participation is what makes the experiance enjoyable and her abuse is not enjoyable to anyone except a sadist. At a certain point the story begins to move from one that has certain individuals needing to suck ""soma"" from the breasts,(if ONLY that line would have worked ""back in the day"" but...)to more of one that is far more abusive than is needed to perpetuate the storyline and the series begins its decent towards a more sadistic tone.It is best to finish this season and call it a day as what comes next can be unbearable. 3 1/2 to 4 Stars for the quality of art,production and the all-too-brief reprises from brutality.",4,Qwaser of Stigmata:Collection 2,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",2013,1977,"['cure', 'Sasha', 'amnesia', 'caused', 'last', 'battle', 'course', 'trip', 'girls', 'hot', 'springs', 'spa', 'awoke', 'battle', 'favorite', 'sadist', 'Katja', 'convinced', 'really', 'girl', 'was', 'transformed', 'boy', 'evil', 'witch.This', 'series', 'everyone', 'buck', 'naked', 'pool', 'where', 'try', 'force', 'Sasha', 'remember', 'male', 'first', 'episode', 'stated', 'cast', 'fan', 'service.It', 'also', 'one', 'few', 'episodes', 'very', 'little', 'abuse', 'girls', 'breasts', 'Hana', 'enjoying', 'Katja', 'tormenting', 'god-awfully', 'large', 'woman', 'Big', 'Mum', 'Hell', 'Dairy', 'Cow', 'first', 'appearance', 'rates', 'girls', 'breasts', 'Thus', 'collection', 'story', 'line', 'proceeds', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'including', 'Qwaser', 'Sodium', 'earnest', 'foe', 'Sasha', 'poor', 'Tomo', 'kidnapped', 'transformed', 'embodiment', 'Qwaser', 'Gold.The', 'artwork', 'first', 'rate', 'several', 'mini-side', 'arcs', 'such', 'rich-girl', 'daughter', 'present', 'head', 'master', 'Tsujidou', 'Miyuri', 'wanting', 'be', 'pop-hero', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'offer', 'much', 'comedy.There', 'however', 'continuing', 'pervasive', 'excessive', 'abuse', 'girls', 'measure', 'nudity', 'understand', 'idea', 'boobs', 'are', 'not', 'ala', 'carte', 'girl', 'attached', 'participation', 'what', 'experiance', 'enjoyable', 'abuse', 'not', 'enjoyable', 'anyone', 'sadist', 'certain', 'point', 'story', 'move', 'one', 'certain', 'individuals', 'needing', 'suck', 'soma', 'breasts', 'ONLY', 'line', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'back', 'day', 'more', 'one', 'far', 'more', 'abusive', 'needed', 'perpetuate', 'storyline', 'series', 'decent', 'towards', 'more', 'sadistic', 'tone.It', 'best', 'finish', 'season', 'call', 'day', 'what', 'next', 'can', 'be', 'unbearable', '3', '1/2', '4', 'Stars', 'quality', 'art', 'production', 'all-too-brief', 'reprises', 'brutality']",The Qwaser of Stigmata Collection 2
1606750,A182VTJIIEVM37,B00A8305MW,GintaxAlvissforever,"[3, 6]","In all honestly, the dark plot that season 1 opens up with is gone. Yes the music makes it seem like the season will be darker but after the ending of part 1, it gets softer from there. Yes, this portion has more fanservice and this is where the anime changes compared to the manga. After Sasha battle with Tasuku, the anime goes its own route (as well as season 2).This season has the same amount of action and the situation is more dire with Tomo being kidnapped by Gold. Because of Tomo's disappearance from the main cast, the series becomes more serious on Sasha and Mayufu's side (and I love how the school doesn't do anything about Tomo's disappearance and only people associated with Sasha know she got herself kidnapped).There really isn't much to say except this season has Sasha and Mayufu develop feelings for each other. Compared to the rush of the first part of the season, the second half is weak in comparison.I think what pissed me off the most is Tasuku's introduction. He's a cool guy (in the loose sense) but what I hate is how his reaction to being humiliated is to use his powers to RAPE the girl who humiliated him. WHAT. THE. HELL. Tasuku takes it as a joke and his girlfriend doesn't seem to care (she seems worse in all honesty as she tried to rape Mayufu while Tasuku went to have his way to humiliate that girl and attack Sasha). A match made in heaven that it's hard to sympathize with this crazy couple given they're the ones that team up with Sasha and Mayufu in this half after what happens to Lizzy (and Teresa kind of falls out of the main circle after Tomo disappears). He is never punished or apologizes for his actions and it ticks me off. Since this series is all about fanservice, it's given no one will apologize for coping a feel but Tasuku is an anti-hero and it may be double standard given he's a guy and Katja wouldn't hesitate to rape someone but first impressions are important and Katja's first impression is her killing people instead of showing how she is good at seducing pedophiles.Overall, this portion dropped in quality according to me.",4,Lighter and Softer Than Part 1,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,2090,"['honestly', 'dark', 'plot', 'season', '1', 'up', 'gone', 'Yes', 'music', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'darker', 'ending', 'part', '1', 'softer', 'there', 'Yes', 'portion', 'more', 'fanservice', 'where', 'anime', 'changes', 'compared', 'manga', 'Sasha', 'battle', 'Tasuku', 'anime', 'own', 'route', 'as', 'well', 'season', '2', '.This', 'season', 'same', 'amount', 'action', 'situation', 'more', 'dire', 'Tomo', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'Gold', 'Tomo', 'disappearance', 'main', 'cast', 'series', 'more', 'serious', 'Sasha', 'Mayufu', 'side', 'love', 'how', 'school', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'Tomo', 'disappearance', 'only', 'people', 'associated', 'Sasha', 'know', 'got', 'kidnapped', '.There', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'say', 'season', 'Sasha', 'Mayufu', 'develop', 'feelings', 'other', 'Compared', 'rush', 'first', 'part', 'season', 'second', 'half', 'weak', 'comparison.I', 'think', 'what', 'pissed', 'off', 'most', 'Tasuku', 'introduction', 'cool', 'guy', 'loose', 'sense', 'what', 'hate', 'how', 'reaction', 'being', 'humiliated', 'use', 'powers', 'RAPE', 'girl', 'who', 'humiliated', 'WHAT', 'HELL', 'Tasuku', 'joke', 'girlfriend', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'worse', 'honesty', 'tried', 'rape', 'Mayufu', 'Tasuku', 'went', 'have', 'way', 'humiliate', 'girl', 'attack', 'Sasha', 'match', 'made', 'heaven', 'hard', 'sympathize', 'crazy', 'couple', 'given', ""'re"", 'ones', 'team', 'up', 'Sasha', 'Mayufu', 'half', 'what', 'Lizzy', 'Teresa', 'kind', 'falls', 'main', 'circle', 'Tomo', 'disappears', 'never', 'punished', 'apologizes', 'actions', 'off', 'series', 'fanservice', 'given', 'one', 'will', 'apologize', 'coping', 'feel', 'Tasuku', 'anti-hero', 'may', 'be', 'double', 'standard', 'given', 'guy', 'Katja', 'would', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'rape', 'someone', 'first', 'impressions', 'are', 'important', 'Katja', 'first', 'impression', 'killing', 'people', 'instead', 'showing', 'how', 'good', 'seducing', 'pedophiles.Overall', 'portion', 'dropped', 'quality', 'according']",The Qwaser of Stigmata Collection 2

I basically reviewed all of it over on the first boxset.Let me give you the reasons to watch this: Bad-ass main boy who is thirteen, slightly built, and doesn't have a girly voice, a lot of the main girls kick ass as well, including a loli dominatrix who already has one slave (and about 3 or four by the end of season 2), the music in this boxset (the ending theme) is probably my favorite song from the series (although I love the season 2 ed theme too... so hard to pick between them), it has TONS of fanservice, the powers are different and the way they get them is even better (by sucking out holy breast milk), and, even though he has a lot of girls that like him, they don't all throw themselves at him, he actually CHOOSES a girl whole-heartedly by the end of this boxset, and it's funny every now and then, dramatic, and just dark enough to keep you loving it. It's refreshing to see an anime like this when you're tired of Girls Bravo and To Love Ru, and the like. Watch it online uncensored before buying.
