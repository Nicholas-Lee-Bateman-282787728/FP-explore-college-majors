302824,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6302227178,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 3]","Mostly, I enjoy Danny Kaye. I consider him to be a close second as the funniest redhead in showbiz. He comes across as this warm and gentle guy with massive comedic and musical gifts who, perhaps, at times, had a penchant for too much mugging (but maybe his writers were to blame). He exhibited a flair for contorting his face into these funny expressions and for introducing songs rife with glib, rapid-fire double speak and tongue twisters. He was also a natural at physical slapstick. With the success of his first starring role in the 1944 feature UP IN ARMS, the powers-that-be in Hollywood couldn't wait to throw Danny Kaye back onto the public consciousness. So, a year later, Kaye's second feature film WONDER MAN was released.The outrageous plot: When carefree and popular nightclub performer Buster Dingle (Danny Kaye), whose stage name is ""Buzzy Bellew,"" is gunned down for having witnessed a murder, his ghost comes back and convinces his shy, bookish twin brother, Edwin Dingle (also Danny Kaye), to pose as himself until things are set right.Except that Edwin, who may have a photographic mind and may be able to write simultaneously with both hands, is a life-long maladroit and needs all the help he can get in the unfamiliar world of savvy crooks and glitzy show business. And that help comes in the form of Buster's ghost as, often, events conspire to force Buster to take over Edwin's body to bail him out of a jam, with predictably zany results. Eventually, after some more farcical bits and several wacky musical numbers, the bad guy is nabbed and the girl is won over.Even with sumptuous eye candy being provided by a game Virginia Mayo, who plays the lovely and wholesome librarian Ellen, and newbie Vera-Ellen, here making her film debut as club entertainer and Buzzy's fiancee Midge, the main draw is still Danny Kaye. His wife Sylvia Fine, throughout Danny's career, has excelled in writing specialty lyrics and songs which ideally suited his talents for mimicry and double speak. She contributes here with ""Bali Boogie"" and adapts the Russian song ""Otchi Tchorniya"" to Danny Kaye's particular brand of musical mayhem. I'm not sure if she has anything to do with Kaye's uproarious skewering of opera near the end, although I would suspect...yeah.In the course of his acting career, Danny Kaye's resume boasted less than 20 feature films. WONDER MAN falls somewhere just below his very best cinematic works. For my money, his two best pictures are THE COURT JESTER and THE FIVE PENNIES. In fact, I consider THE INSPECTOR GENERAL and THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY to be better than WONDER MAN. Here, Kaye mugs just a bit too often for my taste. I don't much care for his telephoned barnyard noises, and his ""Palpably Inadequate Blues"" routine in Prospect Park gratingly channels Jerry Lewis at his histrionical worst. Sadly, a good portion of the gags in this film is too broad and dated.Now, with all that, I can't quite bring myself to give a Danny Kaye film a rating below three stars. I'll always feel that his potential was never fully tapped, but in other films and even in several scenes in this one, we get a glimpse of how entertaining and talented this man is. To quote several of the extras in this film: ""What a guy."" WONDER MAN, with its flaws, is still pretty diverting stuff and solidly delivers on what the audience expects, which is Danny Kaye unleashed. It's a good enough flick and merits 3.5 out of 5 stars.",4,"""As Shakespeare once said - Buster!""",1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,3453,"['Mostly', 'enjoy', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'consider', 'be', 'close', 'second', 'funniest', 'redhead', 'showbiz', 'across', 'warm', 'gentle', 'guy', 'massive', 'comedic', 'musical', 'gifts', 'who', 'perhaps', 'times', 'had', 'penchant', 'too', 'much', 'mugging', 'maybe', 'writers', 'were', 'blame', 'exhibited', 'flair', 'contorting', 'face', 'funny', 'expressions', 'introducing', 'songs', 'rife', 'glib', 'rapid-fire', 'double', 'speak', 'tongue', 'twisters', 'was', 'also', 'natural', 'physical', 'slapstick', 'success', 'first', 'starring', 'role', '1944', 'feature', 'UP', 'IN', 'ARMS', 'powers-that-be', 'Hollywood', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'throw', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'back', 'public', 'consciousness', 'So', 'year', 'later', 'Kaye', 'second', 'feature', 'film', 'WONDER', 'MAN', 'was', 'released.The', 'outrageous', 'plot', 'When', 'carefree', 'popular', 'nightclub', 'performer', 'Buster', 'Dingle', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'stage', 'name', 'Buzzy', 'Bellew', 'gunned', 'down', 'having', 'witnessed', 'murder', 'ghost', 'back', 'shy', 'bookish', 'twin', 'brother', 'Edwin', 'Dingle', 'also', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'pose', 'things', 'are', 'set', 'Edwin', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'photographic', 'mind', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'write', 'simultaneously', 'hands', 'life-long', 'maladroit', 'help', 'can', 'get', 'unfamiliar', 'world', 'savvy', 'crooks', 'glitzy', 'show', 'business', 'help', 'form', 'Buster', 'ghost', 'often', 'events', 'conspire', 'force', 'Buster', 'take', 'over', 'Edwin', 'body', 'bail', 'jam', 'predictably', 'zany', 'results', 'Eventually', 'more', 'farcical', 'bits', 'several', 'wacky', 'musical', 'numbers', 'bad', 'guy', 'nabbed', 'girl', 'won', 'over.Even', 'sumptuous', 'eye', 'candy', 'being', 'provided', 'game', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'who', 'lovely', 'wholesome', 'librarian', 'Ellen', 'newbie', 'Vera-Ellen', 'here', 'making', 'film', 'debut', 'club', 'entertainer', 'Buzzy', 'fiancee', 'Midge', 'main', 'draw', 'still', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'wife', 'Sylvia', 'Fine', 'Danny', 'career', 'excelled', 'writing', 'specialty', 'lyrics', 'songs', 'ideally', 'suited', 'talents', 'mimicry', 'double', 'speak', 'here', 'Bali', 'Boogie', 'Russian', 'song', 'Otchi', 'Tchorniya', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'particular', 'brand', 'musical', 'mayhem', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'anything', 'do', 'Kaye', 'uproarious', 'skewering', 'opera', 'end', 'would', 'suspect', 'course', 'acting', 'career', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'resume', 'boasted', 'less', '20', 'feature', 'films', 'WONDER', 'MAN', 'somewhere', 'just', 'very', 'best', 'cinematic', 'works', 'money', 'two', 'best', 'pictures', 'are', 'THE', 'COURT', 'JESTER', 'THE', 'FIVE', 'PENNIES', 'fact', 'consider', 'INSPECTOR', 'GENERAL', 'THE', 'SECRET', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'WALTER', 'MITTY', 'be', 'better', 'WONDER', 'MAN', 'Here', 'Kaye', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'often', 'taste', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'telephoned', 'barnyard', 'noises', 'Palpably', 'Inadequate', 'Blues', 'routine', 'Prospect', 'Park', 'gratingly', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'histrionical', 'worst', 'Sadly', 'good', 'portion', 'gags', 'film', 'too', 'broad', 'dated.Now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bring', 'give', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'film', 'rating', 'three', 'stars', ""'ll"", 'always', 'feel', 'potential', 'was', 'never', 'fully', 'tapped', 'other', 'films', 'even', 'several', 'scenes', 'one', 'get', 'glimpse', 'how', 'entertaining', 'talented', 'man', 'quote', 'several', 'extras', 'film', 'What', 'guy', 'WONDER', 'MAN', 'flaws', 'still', 'pretty', 'diverting', 'stuff', 'solidly', 'delivers', 'what', 'audience', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'unleashed', 'good', 'enough', 'flick', 'merits', '3.5', '5', 'stars']",Wonder Man VHS

302833,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,6302227178,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[1, 1]","After striking gold with the army comedy ""Up In Arms"", MGM quickly lined up another vehicle for the irrepressible Danny Kaye: ""Wonder Man"" (1945). This dizzy, typically-splashy MGM production cast Kaye in two roles: As a brash, fun-loving nightclub entertainer (Buzzy Bellew), and as his timid, bookish librarian twin brother. The gist of the story is this: Buzzy is scheduled to testify against a mobster, but gets bumped off before the big day. Enter the bookworm brother, whom Buzzy's spirit persuades to impersonate him in order to flush out the killer(s). Naturally, he gets entangled in his dead brother's affairs, particularly with his girlfriend (Vera-Allen) and the lovely Virginia Mayo (who would be Kaye's leading lady in three more films).There are some wonderfully inspired comedy bits: The absent-minded ""potato salad"" routine; Kaye's frequent cries of ""BUSTER!"" in times of peril; his zany park encounter with his brother's spirit; and the climactic opera as Kaye ""encodes"" a message for help to police in song. Besides Mayo, there are some familiar faces in the cast, especially Natalie Shaffer, years before ""Gilligan's Island"" but recognizable with her trill-like Mrs. Howell voice. And of course, there are the over-the-top musical numbers which Kaye tackles with relish.The chink in the armor is Kaye's screen characterization; it wouldn't be until a few films later in which the producers slowed down Kaye's pace and toned down his manic behavior.Still, this film showed Kaye as a ""work in progress"", and off to a dazzling start!",5,An early Kaye effort,1320969600,"11 11, 2011",2011,1550,"['striking', 'gold', 'army', 'comedy', 'Arms', 'MGM', 'quickly', 'lined', 'up', 'vehicle', 'irrepressible', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'Wonder', 'Man', '1945', 'dizzy', 'typically-splashy', 'MGM', 'production', 'cast', 'Kaye', 'two', 'roles', 'brash', 'fun-loving', 'nightclub', 'entertainer', 'Buzzy', 'Bellew', 'timid', 'bookish', 'librarian', 'twin', 'brother', 'gist', 'story', 'Buzzy', 'scheduled', 'testify', 'mobster', 'bumped', 'off', 'big', 'day', 'Enter', 'bookworm', 'brother', 'whom', 'Buzzy', 'spirit', 'persuades', 'impersonate', 'order', 'flush', 'out', 'killer', 's', 'Naturally', 'entangled', 'dead', 'brother', 'affairs', 'particularly', 'girlfriend', 'Vera-Allen', 'lovely', 'Virginia', 'Mayo', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'Kaye', 'leading', 'lady', 'three', 'more', 'films', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'inspired', 'comedy', 'bits', 'absent-minded', 'potato', 'salad', 'routine', 'Kaye', 'frequent', 'cries', 'BUSTER', 'times', 'peril', 'zany', 'park', 'encounter', 'brother', 'spirit', 'climactic', 'opera', 'Kaye', 'encodes', 'message', 'help', 'police', 'song', 'Mayo', 'are', 'familiar', 'cast', 'especially', 'Natalie', 'Shaffer', 'years', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'recognizable', 'trill-like', 'Mrs.', 'Howell', 'voice', 'course', 'are', 'over-the-top', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Kaye', 'relish.The', 'chink', 'armor', 'Kaye', 'screen', 'characterization', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'few', 'films', 'later', 'producers', 'slowed', 'down', 'Kaye', 'pace', 'toned', 'down', 'manic', 'behavior.Still', 'film', 'showed', 'Kaye', 'work', 'progress', 'dazzling', 'start']",Wonder Man VHS

By the time I came around his Hollywood days were pretty much behind him and were replaced by his UNICEF work.  The Danny Kaye movies I have seen over the years were often mediocre at best.  There were times I could tell he had talent but the scripts and the directors apparently had less.  In ""Wonder Man"" I sat back in appreciation of the wide range of talent he has.  His gift for accents and his facial animations were on display and the script and direction seemed to realize that Kaye was the key to the movie.  His portrayal of a Russian singer with hayfever was inspired (although I wondered if that would actually work as a nightclub act).  My favorite was the first number he did.

302835,A16QODENBJVUI1,6302227178,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","Along with THE KID FROM BROOKLYN, this is my favorite Danny Kaye film.  Kaye is actually experiencing a mild resurgence among younger people these days because of the inclusion of the great song he did with the Andrews Sisters, ""Civilization,"" in the soundtrack for the hugely successful game FALLOUT 3 (actually one of the best soundtracks of the past couple of years).  There is no question that Kaye was a major, unique talent.  Most of his films have not held up especially well.  They are very much products of the sensibility of the times and don't feel as timeless as the best of the Marx Brothers or Astaire and Rogers.  Over the course of a feature length film he can come across as somewhat over-the-top.  He sometimes is more silly than funny.  Nonetheless, at his best he can be hysterical.This was the first of a string of films that Kaye made at Goldwyn, usually with Virginia Mayo as the female lead.  He had the previous year been in UP IN ARMS with Dinah Shore and Dana Andrews in a supporting role, but he pretty much stole the movie with one of his more memorable patter songs.  Not everything in this film works and the humor is often strained, but Kaye has so much charm and he throws himself into the film with so much energy that he overwhelms the weaknesses by sheer force of will.  My biggest complaint with the film is that there weren't more musical numbers.  ""Bali Boogie"" is so charming that you wish there had been two or three more like it.  Instead, the film is limited to four musical numbers, one of them a surprisingly flat version of ""Otchi Tchorniya"" by Kay.  ""So in Love,"" however, with Vera-Ellen dancing (though as always her voice was dubbed) is nearly as much fun as ""Bali Boogie.""  This was, by the way, Vera-Ellen's first movie.  She is one of my favorite performers from the forties and fifties, an utterly delightful dancer possessed of remarkable girl-next-door beauty.All in all this is a tremendously entertaining film, the kind of popular entertainment that Hollywood seemed capable of churning out in seemingly unending quantities in the forties.  And it remains perhaps the presentation of Danny Kaye's unique abilities on film.
