1063543,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B000OCY7L2,Allan M. Lees,"[28, 29]","Director Jean-Claude Brisseau seems to be using this movie to proclaim his innocence after being on the sticky end of a fair amount of criticism following his first ""female masturbation movie"" Choses Secrets. So here he's showing us what went on behind the camera, supposedly, and telling us that really he's been misunderstood and wrongly accused. Well, I suppose if you can get a budget for what is essentially a 100+ minute essay on ""why I'm really a nice guy"" then more power to you.French movies, in years gone by, often seemed to be on the edge of tipping over into self-indulgence and wilful obscurantism. Sad to say, this movie is guilty of the same thing. In a way you can almost imagine it inspired by Peter Greenaway - though there's none of Greenaway's elaborate framing, just his penchant for obscure symbolism.Perhaps the biggest problem with the film is that it is pursuing the director's own personal obsession with female sexuality in much the same way as Choses Secrets (and later A l'Aventure) without actually developing beyond what was explored in the earlier film. Yes, it's charming to watch pretty women masturbate and Brisseau is to be commended for seeing sexuality as something potentially ecstatic and mystical, rather than merely mundane. But he explores this trope relentlessly through the narrow passageway of female masturbation and in the end the corridor is simply too narrow to enable him to develop his theme adequately. Although it seems difficult to imagine in the abstract, the fact is that after a while the repetition is simply boring. The director lacks the breadth and depth of vision necessary to move beyond the obvious. In the end it feels like we're watching a big-budget art school project where the ambition is much greater than the talent available.",3,Pretentious but Pretty,1303862400,"04 27, 2011",2011,1799,"['Director', 'Jean-Claude', 'Brisseau', 'be', 'using', 'movie', 'proclaim', 'innocence', 'being', 'sticky', 'end', 'fair', 'amount', 'criticism', 'following', 'first', 'female', 'masturbation', 'movie', 'Choses', 'Secrets', 'So', 'here', 'showing', 'went', 'camera', 'supposedly', 'telling', 'really', 'been', 'misunderstood', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'Well', 'suppose', 'can', 'get', 'budget', 'what', 'essentially', '100+', 'minute', 'essay', 'why', ""'m"", 'really', 'nice', 'guy', 'then', 'more', 'power', 'you.French', 'movies', 'years', 'gone', 'often', 'seemed', 'be', 'edge', 'tipping', 'over', 'self-indulgence', 'wilful', 'obscurantism', 'Sad', 'say', 'movie', 'guilty', 'same', 'thing', 'way', 'can', 'almost', 'imagine', 'inspired', 'Peter', 'Greenaway', 'none', 'Greenaway', 'elaborate', 'framing', 'just', 'penchant', 'obscure', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'pursuing', 'director', 'own', 'personal', 'obsession', 'female', 'sexuality', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Choses', 'Secrets', 'later', 'A', ""l'Aventure"", 'actually', 'developing', 'what', 'was', 'explored', 'earlier', 'film', 'Yes', 'charming', 'watch', 'pretty', 'women', 'masturbate', 'Brisseau', 'be', 'commended', 'seeing', 'sexuality', 'something', 'potentially', 'ecstatic', 'mystical', 'rather', 'merely', 'mundane', 'trope', 'relentlessly', 'narrow', 'passageway', 'female', 'masturbation', 'end', 'corridor', 'simply', 'too', 'narrow', 'enable', 'develop', 'theme', 'adequately', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'abstract', 'fact', 'repetition', 'simply', 'boring', 'director', 'breadth', 'depth', 'vision', 'necessary', 'move', 'obvious', 'end', ""'re"", 'watching', 'big-budget', 'art', 'school', 'project', 'where', 'ambition', 'much', 'greater', 'talent', 'available']",The Exterminating Angels

1063564,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000OCY7L2,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[93, 101]","I thought this was a decent film and I understand where the director was getting at. It's not easy to talk about and can be read on different levels. It presents itself as a fairly straightforward, commercial film with all the necessary ingredients to summon a huge, mainly masculine, crowd. ""The Exterminating Angels"" tells the story of filmmaker Franois (Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric van den Driessche) who aims to make a film exploring female eroticism, during pre-production he put two women, Charlotte (Maroussia Dubreuil) and Julie (Lise Bellynck) to the test by filming them have sex, then a third joins, waitress St&eacute;phanie (Marie Allan) in and they develop a close sexual bond. So much so that they begin to enjoy the thrill of having sex in front of Franois who they grow to covet. The relationship becomes dangerous when Franois discovers that temptation, jealousy and lust puts his film in jeopardy.First of all, some may call me ignorant but I have no idea what the meaning of the angles are in this film? The symbolism slipped by me. They watch over the filmmaker and occasionally influence situations, other than that it's a mystery. Perhaps it's a statement about those that watch over us may also have the power to mess with us? Furthermore this film is an incredibly male-centred fantasy piece that pushes the envelope. It's a total ""I wish"" movie to see a bunch of ladies get it on? It seemed like Brisseau was playing out his fantasy by proxy through the character Franois or to a certain extent using the character as a means to justify what he asks women to do for his films. Some may call it sophisticated art while others porn but the bottom line is that the film does features some erotic scenes, many of which are border-line porn. Nothing to the extremes as seen in the tastefully bad ""Baise-Moi"" (2000) hardcore porn masquerading as art-house cult cinema, this film is at least tasteful in it's depictions of lesbian interactions, well as tasteful as they can be anyway.I also found the film to be incredibly slow to an artful degree, if it wasn't for the occasional bouts of sex that broke up the mundane and occasionally pretentious dialogue this would have been a totally mind-numbing experience. I even felt that the performances by the young female cast members to be totally void of any emotion even when engaging with themselves it was like watching robots programmed to perform a specific function, this film is supposed to be about exploring female eroticism (at least that's what the character of Franois was going for) yet I felt that these girls didn't connect with one another. What I did like was the film's noir tone and visual style is rather impressive and the film's themes become somewhat clearer when looked at in this light, the manipulative undertones surface and the complexity of this film's core is revealed, however at the end of the day ""The Exterminating Angels"" is too art house for the art house crowd and not explicit enough for the porno crowd...it lays in a strange middle ground.",4,"[3.5]--This services a mixture of confusion, fear, excitement and awe",1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,3041,"['thought', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'understand', 'where', 'director', 'was', 'getting', 'not', 'easy', 'talk', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'different', 'levels', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'commercial', 'film', 'necessary', 'ingredients', 'summon', 'huge', 'mainly', 'masculine', 'crowd', 'Exterminating', 'Angels', 'story', 'filmmaker', 'Franois', 'Fr', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'ric', 'van', 'den', 'Driessche', 'who', 'make', 'film', 'exploring', 'female', 'eroticism', 'pre-production', 'put', 'two', 'women', 'Charlotte', 'Maroussia', 'Dubreuil', 'Julie', 'Lise', 'Bellynck', 'test', 'filming', 'have', 'sex', 'then', 'third', 'joins', 'waitress', 'St', 'eacute', 'Marie', 'Allan', 'develop', 'close', 'sexual', 'bond', 'So', 'much', 'begin', 'enjoy', 'thrill', 'having', 'sex', 'front', 'Franois', 'who', 'grow', 'covet', 'relationship', 'dangerous', 'when', 'Franois', 'temptation', 'jealousy', 'lust', 'film', 'jeopardy.First', 'may', 'call', 'ignorant', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'meaning', 'angles', 'are', 'film', 'symbolism', 'slipped', 'watch', 'filmmaker', 'occasionally', 'influence', 'situations', 'other', 'mystery', 'Perhaps', 'statement', 'watch', 'may', 'also', 'have', 'power', 'mess', 'Furthermore', 'film', 'incredibly', 'male-centred', 'fantasy', 'piece', 'envelope', 'total', 'wish', 'movie', 'see', 'bunch', 'ladies', 'get', 'seemed', 'Brisseau', 'was', 'playing', 'out', 'fantasy', 'proxy', 'character', 'Franois', 'certain', 'extent', 'using', 'character', 'means', 'justify', 'what', 'women', 'do', 'films', 'may', 'call', 'sophisticated', 'art', 'others', 'porn', 'bottom', 'line', 'film', 'erotic', 'scenes', 'many', 'are', 'border-line', 'porn', 'Nothing', 'extremes', 'seen', 'tastefully', 'bad', 'Baise-Moi', '2000', 'hardcore', 'porn', 'masquerading', 'art-house', 'cult', 'cinema', 'film', 'least', 'tasteful', 'depictions', 'lesbian', 'interactions', 'well', 'as', 'tasteful', 'can', 'be', 'anyway.I', 'also', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'incredibly', 'slow', 'artful', 'degree', 'was', ""n't"", 'occasional', 'bouts', 'sex', 'broke', 'up', 'mundane', 'occasionally', 'pretentious', 'dialogue', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'totally', 'mind-numbing', 'experience', 'even', 'felt', 'performances', 'young', 'female', 'cast', 'members', 'be', 'totally', 'void', 'emotion', 'even', 'when', 'engaging', 'was', 'watching', 'robots', 'programmed', 'perform', 'specific', 'function', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'exploring', 'female', 'eroticism', 'least', 'what', 'character', 'Franois', 'was', 'going', 'yet', 'felt', 'girls', 'did', ""n't"", 'connect', 'one', 'What', 'did', 'like', 'was', 'film', 'noir', 'tone', 'visual', 'style', 'rather', 'impressive', 'film', 'themes', 'become', 'somewhat', 'clearer', 'when', 'looked', 'light', 'manipulative', 'undertones', 'surface', 'complexity', 'film', 'core', 'revealed', 'however', 'end', 'day', 'Exterminating', 'Angels', 'too', 'art', 'house', 'art', 'house', 'crowd', 'not', 'explicit', 'enough', 'porno', 'crowd', 'strange', 'middle', 'ground']",The Exterminating Angels

Munyon,"[4, 9]","A guy posing as a (film maker / producer / director) interviews and then screen tests young beautiful women to perform in the nude (solo / lesbian partner / multiple lesbian partners) so he can capture on celluloid the expression of ecstasy while they rouse up their libido and manipulate themselves erotically and / or each other to climax (of course he gets to watch right there in the room).  The film is in French; loosely subtitled 95% of the time into English.  One hour and forty minutes of softcore exploitation of women, who expose themselves with subdued expression and / or restrained emotion; unable to completely ignore their nervousness of being part of such a film.  I wasn't sure just what this film would be like, and before the halfway point I decided I wasn't the intended audience.  You might be though, if you're less nave than I was; or more progressive and embracing of any and all lifestyle experiences.  Somehow this violates the sacred gift shared between two human beings in a completely different format; not really porn (softcore or hardcore) and not really art or educational either.  I'm not sure what this is meant to inspire or encourage from the viewer - there doesn't seem to be any point IMHO, it seems like I'm watching through a keyhole while an unabashed voyeur sits in the room and watches a quite mild exchange between women in bed together, but never really gets with it.  This film definitely delivers more than what I anticipated - I wouldn't call this a ""fun"" film, and it CAN'T be intended to be all that stimulating.

1063568,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B000OCY7L2,K. Driscoll,"[41, 46]","Ironically, The Exterminating Angels seems to be a critique on making sexually explicit and arousing films, but at the same time it certainly is one.  It just so happens to be the highest quality of its ilk that I've seen since perhaps The Dreamers.  Looking briefly at other recent movies that The Exterminating Angels may be compared to (i.e. 9 Songs, Shortbus) it isn't as graphic and it strictly involves female sexuality and nudity.  There is a massive amount of nudity in The Exterminating Angels, but only a few shots go over the line in terms of acceptable content in mainstream American films.  Some angles in The Exterminating Angels show absolutely every part of the actresses' bodies.  I felt it was justified given the fundamentally sexual subject matter and there were actually many opportunities in this movie to show even more nudity but it didn't, so I'm not sure we can definitely call it gratuitous.  It definitely would've been a lesser film without it, and I mean that as both a stern critic and as a libidinous male.The Exterminating Angels is about Franois, a filmmaker who needs to find several uninhibited actresses who are not afraid to appear in his explicit semi-improvisational film.  He wants actresses and not porn stars because porn stars have been there and will not transfer effectively to his vision of taboos and unexplored female sexuality.  In other words, the actresses have not been exploited yet and that is what he wants to show.  We get the feeling that Francois is a very serious filmmaker.Franois is visited by his dead Grandmother in the middle of the night and she warns him of the future.  As Franois begins his search for the right actresses, he comes across a girl who willingly experiences a real climax at her audition, and it is her first time ever.  Franois requested she fake it but she went right ahead anyway and explained that she did it because the idea of doing so in this setting is what turned her on.  Franois, fascinated by this exchange, decides to explore why this happens.  But he never chose that girl for a part in his film, so he essentially and unwittingly used her.  He does eventually get the appropriate actresses and relationships with them develop and trust issues surface in no time.  One of them even falls in love with Franois but he doesn't know anything about this, as to him he's just making a movie.  Being behind the camera is a loveless experience to him but being in front of it is an incredibly intense sexual exploration to his actresses, and they are not stable people to begin with.There were also two apparitional girls that indicate no longer being angels, but not quite witches yet either who follow Franois around.  One of them even helps to originally persuade one of the three actresses to approach Franois about a role in the film.  In the end they seem to both be conflicted about what Franois has done to these girls.  That element coupled with the extra random and surreal dialogue that accompanies some of the more unnatural scenes perplexed me a bit.  There are certainly some aspects that were artier than I think they needed to be but perhaps I need to see the film again.  Also, I can't help but think this is a self-indulgent effort from director Jean-Claude Brisseau.  Taking that into account it does come off as a bit pompous, and the near accusations I have that Brisseau is guilty of some pretentious elements is certainly consistent with that.  All of that aside, this is still a fiercely determined and erotic film that is well done, brave, and provoking on many levels.",4,The Most Flirtatious Movie in Years,1186531200,"08 8, 2007",2007,3583,"['Ironically', 'Exterminating', 'Angels', 'be', 'critique', 'making', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'arousing', 'films', 'same', 'time', 'certainly', 'one', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'highest', 'quality', 'ilk', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'perhaps', 'Dreamers', 'Looking', 'briefly', 'other', 'recent', 'movies', 'Exterminating', 'Angels', 'may', 'be', 'compared', 'i.e', '9', 'Songs', 'Shortbus', ""n't"", 'graphic', 'strictly', 'female', 'sexuality', 'nudity', 'massive', 'amount', 'nudity', 'Exterminating', 'Angels', 'only', 'few', 'shots', 'go', 'line', 'terms', 'acceptable', 'content', 'mainstream', 'American', 'films', 'angles', 'Exterminating', 'Angels', 'show', 'absolutely', 'part', 'actresses', 'bodies', 'felt', 'was', 'justified', 'given', 'fundamentally', 'sexual', 'subject', 'matter', 'were', 'actually', 'many', 'opportunities', 'movie', 'show', 'even', 'more', 'nudity', 'did', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'definitely', 'call', 'gratuitous', 'definitely', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lesser', 'film', 'mean', 'stern', 'critic', 'libidinous', 'male.The', 'Exterminating', 'Angels', 'Franois', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'find', 'several', 'uninhibited', 'actresses', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'appear', 'explicit', 'semi-improvisational', 'film', 'actresses', 'not', 'porn', 'stars', 'porn', 'stars', 'have', 'been', 'will', 'not', 'transfer', 'effectively', 'vision', 'taboos', 'unexplored', 'female', 'sexuality', 'other', 'words', 'actresses', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'exploited', 'yet', 'what', 'show', 'get', 'feeling', 'Francois', 'very', 'serious', 'filmmaker.Franois', 'visited', 'dead', 'Grandmother', 'middle', 'night', 'future', 'Franois', 'search', 'right', 'actresses', 'girl', 'who', 'willingly', 'real', 'climax', 'audition', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'Franois', 'requested', 'fake', 'went', 'right', 'ahead', 'anyway', 'explained', 'did', 'idea', 'doing', 'so', 'setting', 'what', 'turned', 'Franois', 'fascinated', 'exchange', 'explore', 'why', 'never', 'chose', 'girl', 'part', 'film', 'essentially', 'unwittingly', 'used', 'eventually', 'get', 'appropriate', 'actresses', 'relationships', 'develop', 'trust', 'issues', 'surface', 'time', 'One', 'even', 'love', 'Franois', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'just', 'making', 'movie', 'Being', 'camera', 'loveless', 'experience', 'being', 'front', 'incredibly', 'intense', 'sexual', 'exploration', 'actresses', 'are', 'not', 'stable', 'people', 'begin', 'with.There', 'were', 'also', 'two', 'apparitional', 'girls', 'indicate', 'longer', 'being', 'angels', 'not', 'quite', 'yet', 'who', 'follow', 'Franois', 'One', 'even', 'originally', 'persuade', 'one', 'three', 'actresses', 'approach', 'Franois', 'role', 'film', 'end', 'seem', 'be', 'conflicted', 'what', 'Franois', 'done', 'girls', 'element', 'coupled', 'extra', 'random', 'surreal', 'dialogue', 'more', 'unnatural', 'scenes', 'perplexed', 'bit', 'are', 'certainly', 'aspects', 'were', 'artier', 'think', 'needed', 'be', 'perhaps', 'need', 'see', 'film', 'again', 'Also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'self-indulgent', 'effort', 'director', 'Jean-Claude', 'Brisseau', 'Taking', 'account', 'come', 'off', 'bit', 'pompous', 'near', 'accusations', 'have', 'Brisseau', 'guilty', 'pretentious', 'elements', 'certainly', 'consistent', 'aside', 'still', 'fiercely', 'determined', 'erotic', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'brave', 'provoking', 'many', 'levels']",The Exterminating Angels

There is a great deal of conjecture on the IMDB message boards that Les Anges Exterminateurs is Brisseau's response to charges of harassment filed against him during the making of that film. (I also saw allegations that similar charges were filed against him during the making of this one, but found no verification for this.) While my research, ragtag as it was, was able to neither confirm nor deny any of this, it can't be denied that this movie feels autobiographical, but then you have to take into account that any film a filmmaker makes about a filmmaker making a film is going to feel autobiographical, especially when the filmmaker in the film is making the kind of film the real-life filmmaker makes. Now, go back and try to say all that five times fast. In one breath.Plot: a director, Franois (A Tale of Winter's Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric van den Dreissche), sets out to make a new film. (We think, anyway.) He begins interviewing actresses and, in these interviews, pushes them farther and farther erotically. Is he really interested, as he tells them, in pushing the boundaries of the erotic, or is he just getting a thrill from watching them play with themselves (and, sometimes, each other)? Eventually, he starts focusing on two of the women, Charlotte (Au milieu de la Nuit's Maroussia Dubreuil) and Julie (The Girl from Nowhere's Lisa Bellynck). But then... what does his wife (Saint-Jacques...La Mecque's Marie Allan) think about all this?It continues to amaze me that people can make porn films&#8212;or, in this case, films that border on porn without ever quite getting there&#8212;and still manage to have the final product be a bore. It would be easy (and accurate, judging by lor_'s review of the film on IMDB, which includes information from a director Q&A; confirming the sexual harassment/response allegation) to pass that off as the innate inferiority of memoir, and looking back most porn-like substances I've come across that have bored me to tears have been of that variety. (100 Strokes of the Brush Before Bed, anyone?) But there's an added level of pretentiousness here that also applies; I'm not sure whether I should be applauding Brisseau for having had the hubris to use a trope from Orph&eacute;e or to backhand him, like so many other reviewers have done, for the shameless rip-off. The answer may lie in the question; would anyone but the greatest purist be taking him to task for attempting it if he's actually pulled it off? Taking a tangent from there, arthouse porn is still porn (if you're more ashcan than academic, you may want to look at this from the perspective that arthouse porn is still arthouse; either squinty-eyed view of this crossover is equally valid). While I would never claim to be an authority on the subject, it has always seemed to me that attempts to make arthouse porn are by default attempts to legitimize pornography as an artistic medium (think Winterbottom's 9 Songs here). There should be some argument about whether such legitimization is needed, even if that argument is fading the farther we get away from the days when the &#8220;film&#8221; half of the &#8220;adult film&#8221; genre was just as important. But the legitimizing aspect here has a much darker background given the film's memoir qualities; it can be argued that Brisseau is not attempting to legitimize the pornier aspects of his film as much as he is attempting to legitimize the sexual harassment that spawned the script for this movie. My relatively high rating for the movie, which stems entirely from my appreciation of gratuitous nudity on a movie screen, should tell you that I am at least attempting to give Brisseau the benefit of the doubt here, and my conclusion that any attempts to legitimize sexual harassment to be found here were unconscious on Brisseau's part. If I ever find out that is not the case, I'll be revising the rating on this to zero. **",2,Borenography.,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,4215,"['Les', 'Anges', 'Exterminateurs', 'Exterminating', 'Angels', 'Jean-Claude', 'Brisseau', '2006', 'had', 'entirely', 'forgotten', 'something', 'IMDB', 'boards', 'nudged', 'memory', 'had', 'watched', '8212', 'not', 'been', 'entirely', 'thrilled', '8212', 'one', 'Jean-Claude', 'Brisseau', 'earlier', 'pictures', 'Choses', 'Secr', 'eacute', 'tes', 'back', '2008', 'great', 'deal', 'conjecture', 'IMDB', 'message', 'boards', 'Les', 'Anges', 'Exterminateurs', 'Brisseau', 'response', 'charges', 'harassment', 'filed', 'making', 'film', 'also', 'saw', 'allegations', 'similar', 'charges', 'were', 'filed', 'making', 'one', 'found', 'verification', 'research', 'ragtag', 'was', 'was', 'able', 'confirm', 'deny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'denied', 'movie', 'autobiographical', 'then', 'have', 'take', 'account', 'film', 'filmmaker', 'filmmaker', 'making', 'film', 'going', 'feel', 'autobiographical', 'especially', 'when', 'filmmaker', 'film', 'making', 'kind', 'film', 'real-life', 'filmmaker', 'Now', 'go', 'back', 'try', 'say', 'five', 'times', 'fast', 'one', 'breath.Plot', 'director', 'Franois', 'A', 'Tale', 'Winter', 'Fr', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'ric', 'van', 'den', 'Dreissche', 'out', 'make', 'new', 'film', 'think', 'anyway', 'interviewing', 'actresses', 'interviews', 'pushes', 'farther', 'farther', 'erotically', 'really', 'interested', 'pushing', 'boundaries', 'erotic', 'just', 'getting', 'thrill', 'watching', 'play', 'sometimes', 'other', 'Eventually', 'focusing', 'two', 'women', 'Charlotte', 'Au', 'milieu', 'de', 'la', 'Nuit', 'Maroussia', 'Dubreuil', 'Julie', 'Girl', 'Nowhere', 'Lisa', 'Bellynck', 'then', 'what', 'wife', 'Saint-Jacques', 'La', 'Mecque', 'Marie', 'Allan', 'think', 'amaze', 'people', 'can', 'make', 'porn', 'films', '8212', 'case', 'films', 'border', 'porn', 'ever', 'quite', 'getting', 'there', '8212', 'still', 'manage', 'have', 'final', 'product', 'be', 'bore', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'accurate', 'judging', 'lor_', 'review', 'film', 'IMDB', 'information', 'director', 'Q', 'A', 'confirming', 'sexual', 'harassment/response', 'allegation', 'pass', 'off', 'innate', 'inferiority', 'memoir', 'looking', 'back', 'most', 'porn-like', 'substances', ""'ve"", 'come', 'have', 'bored', 'tears', 'have', 'been', 'variety', '100', 'Strokes', 'Brush', 'Bed', 'anyone', 'added', 'level', 'pretentiousness', 'here', 'also', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'should', 'be', 'applauding', 'Brisseau', 'having', 'had', 'hubris', 'use', 'trope', 'Orph', 'eacute', 'backhand', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'shameless', 'rip-off', 'answer', 'may', 'lie', 'question', 'would', 'anyone', 'greatest', 'purist', 'be', 'taking', 'task', 'attempting', 'actually', 'pulled', 'off', 'Taking', 'tangent', 'there', 'porn', 'still', 'porn', ""'re"", 'more', 'ashcan', 'academic', 'may', 'want', 'look', 'perspective', 'arthouse', 'porn', 'still', 'arthouse', 'squinty-eyed', 'view', 'crossover', 'equally', 'valid', 'would', 'never', 'claim', 'be', 'authority', 'subject', 'always', 'seemed', 'make', 'arthouse', 'porn', 'are', 'default', 'attempts', 'legitimize', 'pornography', 'artistic', 'medium', 'think', 'Winterbottom', '9', 'Songs', 'here', 'should', 'be', 'argument', 'such', 'legitimization', 'needed', 'even', 'argument', 'fading', 'farther', 'get', 'away', 'days', 'when', '8220', 'film', '8221', 'half', '8220', 'adult', 'film', '8221', 'genre', 'was', 'just', 'important', 'legitimizing', 'aspect', 'here', 'much', 'darker', 'background', 'given', 'film', 'memoir', 'qualities', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'Brisseau', 'not', 'attempting', 'legitimize', 'pornier', 'aspects', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'attempting', 'legitimize', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'spawned', 'script', 'movie', 'My', 'relatively', 'high', 'rating', 'movie', 'entirely', 'appreciation', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'movie', 'screen', 'should', 'tell', 'am', 'least', 'attempting', 'give', 'Brisseau', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'here', 'conclusion', 'attempts', 'legitimize', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'were', 'unconscious', 'Brisseau', 'part', 'ever', 'find', 'out', 'not', 'case', ""'ll"", 'be', 'revising', 'rating', 'zero', '**']",The Exterminating Angels

The camera work is again extraordinary as it was in Secret Things and l'aventure.The story is about a film maker making a documentary on the female climax. The interviews for prospective models adds a very light and comic turn to the movie. However, as in his other films, there is always a sense of foreboding that it is all going to go wrong somewhere. As much as he tries to stay above and removed from the eroticism of his models, and professes to care only about the film project, there is increasingly the suspicion that this is a tragedy and not a comedy. The mystic or metaphysical element that is always in Brisseau's films is very mcuh present in ""Angels"". He seems to be stalked by fallen angels that only the audience can see but that can whisper in his ear to influence him. They quite clearly mean him no good.Watch for scenes as the one where he poses two of the girls by an open door with only the light from the hotel hallway and instructs one to make the other come again. The beautiful indirect light on their bodies makes the whole scene much sexier and more erotic. Fabulous camera work. Oh yes, you may be wondering. The models are all very attractive with sensational bodies. There is full nudity and more lesbian play than boy girl scenes, as the girls help each other out achieving climaxes for the camera.Clearly this is a full step above almost anything else you might have seen in this genre. Brisseau proves again that he can tell a story, create dramatic tension with his characters, while creating eroticism.
