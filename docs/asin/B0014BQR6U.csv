Tenderly executed and tightly edited, two romantic protagonists are wounded by their pasts.  Jose' (Eduardo Ver&aacute;stegui) is from a Mexican-Puerto Rican household, and Nina (Tammy Blanchard) works as a waitress at the same New York City restaurant as he does.  They both are under the authority of Manny, (Manny Perez) Jose's brother, whose sergeant major sensibilities are only understandable when considering the make or break existence of any NYC family business.She is expecting.  Suffering from morning sickness, she is tardy or absent from her waitress post.  Having little time for tolerance, Manny fires her without due process.  Seeming to have less at stake, Jose follows her and tries to find and give her understanding.  He is able to soothe her with badly needed tenderness in her own life.  We discover that her boyfriend requires an abortion, a prospect that brings both resignation and tears to her eyes.  In the meantime, Jose' has had a tragic past with a young child in his own life.  Previously, a city soccer star, Jose' is forced to work for Manny whose martinet demeanor make anything after soccer a viable alternative.  As she is introduced to Jose's family, they side with Manny until Jose's preference gives the family time to warm up and get to know her better.""Bella"" is a wonderful, haunting little movie.  The chemistry between the couple is marvelous to watch from its fruition, and the way they come to terms with their difficult situations make the movie a cathartic and heartwarming movie experience.

1145836,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B0014BQR6U,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[3, 3]","""Bella"" is a finely crafted gem of a movie. It's set in New York City,over the course of a single day. Nina (Tammy Blanchard) discovers that she's pregnant. A co-worker,Jose (the handsome Eduardo Verastegui) follows her, helping her through her ordeal. There are no villains; it lacks melodrama and sappiness (thankfully) There is a hint of romance between the leads,but above all it's a story of redemption. Nina and Jose redeem each other.""Bella"" has flashbacks,flash-forwards and might-have-beens. There are the sweet relationships within Jose's family--between his Puerto Rican father and Mexican mother,his adoptive brother Manny,and his Latin lover brother Eduardo (based on Verastegui's past in Mexican telenovelas--he was cast as the heartthrob) Abortion is handled delicately, without demonizing Nina. She's a desperate woman. Even the unknown father of her child isn't demonized. Abortion is seen as an act of desperation. Jose is Christlike in his generosity&compassion; towards Nina. As Nina has a possibly tragic future,Jose has a tragic past.""Bella"" is poignant and powerful. It's a perfect Christmas movie with its pro-life message. It's a cinematic epiphany.

1145844,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B0014BQR6U,Bill Garrison,"[9, 35]","Bella is a movie that I wouldn't normally watch. I read a good review about the movie and saw that it was a family friendly, dramatic love story. The movie screened at festivals and won awards and had a lot of good things said about it. I decided to give it a try and found it very enjoyable up until the last five minutes of the movie, which totally wasted all the goodwill and emotional investment I had made in the film up until that point. Everything about the movie deserves 5 stars. But the ending gets 1 star.Jose was a great soccer player. After signing a huge contract, he is involved in a incident that sends him to prison and robs him of his passion for life. Once out of jail, he works as a chef at his brother Manny's restaurant. One day, a waitress, Nina, is late. She's late because she's been sick and fears she may be pregnant. When Nina shows up, Manny fires her. While Jose has led a passionless life since the incident, he does feel some sort of attraction to Nina. He follows her and finds out she's been fired, and that she's pregnant.For the rest of the movie, Nina and Jose spend the rest of the day together. They talk about life and love and how she can't possibly bring a baby into this world when she can't even take care of herself. Some people may like to read a pro-life or pro-choice message into this movie. You can do that with any movie that deals with someone having a baby. I didn't see a message here, just a woman who doesn't feel like she's ready to have a baby. She does however connect with Jose. They apparently weren't close when they worked together, but grow close throughout the day. Jose takes Nina home for dinner and the scenes with Jose's family are some of the best in the film.As the day comes to an end, I realized the movie was about over. BELLA takes you on a journey with a man who has not had joy in his life for a long time and a woman who just can't get a break. They seem perfect for each other. Then the climax of the movie occurs and ruined the entire movie. I'm not going to give away the climax here, so people that have seen the movie and disagree will think I'm perhaps being to harsh. I may be wrong, but I don't want to spoil the movie by discussing why the ending was so bad.If you want to watch this movie, you will see a movie with great acting, great characters and a great story. There is nothing really offensive in the movie either. Just be prepared to be disappointed by the ending.

1145845,A20RQB3SXOQCGF,B0014BQR6U,Birdman,"[5, 5]","In the hands of less sensitive screenwriters, BELLA might have been an explicitly religious film. It's fortunate BELLA is something more inclusive and intelligent. It's a quiet little masterpiece about loss and redemption featuring an ensemble cast that rivals those of the best independent films. In particular, Tony-nominee Tammy Blanchard delivers a performance as natural and poignant as any I've seen  in years.Bella is also beautiful because it is honestly multicultural. No formulas or stereotypes here. The director beckons us, and we enter the world of two extraordinary people and the choices they face in an impassive, lonely world. I won't give the plot away because it would be unwelcome by some readers.If you relish movies about real love, family relationships, decency and redemption, you'll love this one. If you enjoyed TENDER MERCIES, PLACES IN THE HEART, REAL GIRLS HAVE CURVES or SMOKE SIGNALS, this film will fit you like a glove. It is also an actor's film. The camera loves virtually every member of this cast, and the performances build on visual expression as well as words.There are those out there who champion this film for religious or political reasons, and that is unfortunate, since that may discourage a wider audience for this very worthy effort.  The dignity and charm of BELLA is that a man and woman - faced with one of the most momentous choices a human can have - choose a path because they are circumspect, and view their crisis in light of their past and future lives. Neither lead character finds solace in institutions or laws.So, if you're in the mood for a life-affirming movie filled with nuanced, sensitive performances and wonderful cultural depth and character, BELLA is for you.  And I'd buy it rather than rent it, because it's a film you'll want to revisit and share with others.Five stars.",5,An Actor's Film,1221868800,"09 20, 2008",2008,1843,"['hands', 'less', 'sensitive', 'screenwriters', 'BELLA', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'explicitly', 'religious', 'film', 'fortunate', 'BELLA', 'something', 'more', 'inclusive', 'intelligent', 'quiet', 'little', 'masterpiece', 'loss', 'redemption', 'featuring', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'rivals', 'best', 'independent', 'films', 'particular', 'Tony-nominee', 'Tammy', 'Blanchard', 'performance', 'natural', 'poignant', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years.Bella', 'also', 'beautiful', 'honestly', 'multicultural', 'formulas', 'stereotypes', 'here', 'director', 'beckons', 'enter', 'world', 'two', 'extraordinary', 'people', 'choices', 'face', 'impassive', 'lonely', 'world', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'plot', 'away', 'would', 'be', 'unwelcome', 'readers.If', 'relish', 'movies', 'real', 'love', 'family', 'relationships', 'decency', 'redemption', ""'ll"", 'love', 'one', 'enjoyed', 'TENDER', 'MERCIES', 'PLACES', 'IN', 'THE', 'HEART', 'REAL', 'GIRLS', 'HAVE', 'CURVES', 'SMOKE', 'SIGNALS', 'film', 'will', 'fit', 'glove', 'also', 'actor', 'film', 'camera', 'virtually', 'member', 'cast', 'performances', 'build', 'visual', 'expression', 'as', 'well', 'words.There', 'are', 'who', 'champion', 'film', 'religious', 'political', 'reasons', 'unfortunate', 'may', 'discourage', 'wider', 'audience', 'very', 'worthy', 'effort', 'dignity', 'charm', 'BELLA', 'man', 'woman', 'faced', 'one', 'most', 'momentous', 'choices', 'human', 'can', 'have', 'choose', 'path', 'are', 'circumspect', 'view', 'crisis', 'light', 'past', 'future', 'lives', 'lead', 'character', 'solace', 'institutions', 'laws.So', ""'re"", 'mood', 'life-affirming', 'movie', 'filled', 'nuanced', 'sensitive', 'performances', 'wonderful', 'cultural', 'depth', 'character', 'BELLA', ""'d"", 'buy', 'rather', 'rent', 'film', ""'ll"", 'want', 'revisit', 'share', 'others.Five', 'stars']",N/A

Bella is a very hard movie to describe - this is one movie you just kind of have to see to even have a clue what it's about.What I can say is that it has the following as key themes:- How our lives can change in a moment and take us radically different directions than we planned- Strong pro-life & pro-adoption message without being too in-your-face preachy.- The importance of truly caring about and engaging with the people all around us - i.e. finding out their ""story""- Reaching beyond your own pain to help someone else (and in the process, helping yourself)- The importance of family and faith- A positive view of latino culture without many of the standard stereotypes found in other moviesThis is an emotionally moving, ultimately uplifting film that has a very ""real"" quality to it, which is fairly rare. It was filmed/produced in a ""modern"" way so there's more jerky camera movement, etc. which did grate on me a tad (i.e. it got old quick), but did contribute to the ""real"" quality and help draw you into the story (and thus the characters). The acting was quite impressive!This is not a ""preachy"" movie with words so much as it preaches with its story. It allows you to see and discover the message yourself as it plays out. This movie is not ""overtly Christian"", though many of its key themes as shown above are ones that are very supportive and positive for Christians.As for things that concerned me: Like a number of films, this one has an undercurrent that God wants or causes the hurt and pain we see in our world. In this film's case though, it's a pretty mild undercurrent except for 1 scene where a blind guy is holding a sign that says something like ""God made me blind, now I can truly see."" (which while an interesting statement, is a bit unfair to assume God's the one that actively caused the blindness/wants him blind, etc.) Other than that, the only thing that really threw me off a bit with this film is that it seemed very rushed at the end. So much so that I actually briefly wondered if I had accidentally pressed the ""forward"" button on my remote and skipped some scenes (I didn't). It seemed like another 5-10 minutes or so could have really helped fill in a bit more at the end. With that said, the ending still ""worked"" and made its point effectively.All things considered, this is a unique movie that has a ""modern"" and ""realistic"" flavor that won't appeal to everyone, but is an engaging, positive, uplifting movie in the final analysis.Chris LongMoviesForChristians Movie Reviewsmoviesforchristians dot org",5,"Uplifting, Encouraging, Positive, & Just Plain GOOD",1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,2590,"['Definitely', 'unique', 'movie', 'sure', 'Bella', 'very', 'hard', 'movie', 'describe', 'one', 'movie', 'just', 'kind', 'have', 'see', 'even', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'following', 'key', 'themes', 'How', 'lives', 'can', 'change', 'moment', 'take', 'radically', 'different', 'directions', 'planned-', 'Strong', 'pro-life', 'pro-adoption', 'message', 'being', 'too', 'in-your-face', 'preachy.-', 'importance', 'truly', 'caring', 'engaging', 'people', 'i.e', 'finding', 'out', 'story', 'Reaching', 'own', 'pain', 'help', 'someone', 'else', 'process', 'helping', 'importance', 'family', 'faith-', 'A', 'positive', 'view', 'latino', 'culture', 'many', 'standard', 'stereotypes', 'found', 'other', 'moviesThis', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'ultimately', 'uplifting', 'film', 'very', 'real', 'quality', 'fairly', 'rare', 'was', 'filmed/produced', 'modern', 'way', 'more', 'jerky', 'camera', 'movement', 'etc', 'did', 'grate', 'tad', 'i.e', 'got', 'old', 'quick', 'did', 'contribute', 'real', 'quality', 'help', 'draw', 'story', 'thus', 'characters', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'impressive', 'not', 'preachy', 'movie', 'words', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'see', 'discover', 'message', 'out', 'movie', 'not', 'overtly', 'Christian', 'many', 'key', 'themes', 'shown', 'are', 'ones', 'are', 'very', 'supportive', 'positive', 'Christians.As', 'things', 'concerned', 'number', 'films', 'one', 'undercurrent', 'God', 'hurt', 'pain', 'see', 'world', 'film', 'case', 'pretty', 'mild', 'undercurrent', '1', 'scene', 'where', 'blind', 'guy', 'holding', 'sign', 'something', 'God', 'made', 'blind', 'now', 'can', 'truly', 'see', 'interesting', 'statement', 'bit', 'unfair', 'assume', 'God', 'one', 'actively', 'caused', 'blindness/wants', 'blind', 'etc', 'Other', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'threw', 'off', 'bit', 'film', 'seemed', 'very', 'rushed', 'end', 'So', 'much', 'actually', 'briefly', 'wondered', 'had', 'accidentally', 'pressed', 'forward', 'button', 'remote', 'skipped', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'seemed', '5-10', 'minutes', 'so', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'helped', 'fill', 'bit', 'more', 'end', 'said', 'ending', 'still', 'worked', 'made', 'point', 'effectively.All', 'things', 'considered', 'unique', 'movie', 'modern', 'realistic', 'flavor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'everyone', 'engaging', 'positive', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'final', 'analysis.Chris', 'LongMoviesForChristians', 'Movie', 'Reviewsmoviesforchristians', 'dot', 'org']",N/A

Yes, it's pure melodrama but: ladies, it's so well done that it should keep your husband or boyfriend interested, too, most of the way.This also is beautifully photographed. Man, for a small-budget independent film with basically no-name actors, this has all the visual slickness of a Spielberg film. Also, the food in here looks so good it will have you salivating.The main ingredient in this award-winning film is ""charm."" Everyone is pretty likable, there's a lot of emotion and the characters are very realistic. If I elaborated on the story, it might sound extremely boring because mainly it's a day in the life of two people. They both work in a restaurant and she gets fired for being late again and he goes after her to see if she's okay. As the day goes on, the two work out past traumas with the ending being a tear-jerker feel-good one.For a film in which most viewers probably aren't familiar with the director or the actors, it is impressive. What's odd about this film, in addition to being interesting despite almost nothing going on, is that there is absolutely no profanity or sex, either. I suppose some could look at this movie as some sappy do-gooder type story, but it isn't.

It's a celebration of everything that is good in this world.  It's about personal redemption after great tragedy.  It extolls the virtues of family.  It glorifies the diverse ethnic fabric that makes our country great.  And, yes, without a degree of heavy-handedness it persusively makes the case for the sanctity of human life in and out of the womb.  At the time of it's theatrical release most of the critics dismissed the film but word of mouth made it a success for a small film of it's type.  When it was in the theatres I tracked it against some of the big releases (i.e. cynical anti-American tripe) and it's grosses either came close or surpassed some of these self-important works.  I think it demonstrates that even though there may be some pessimism in these dangerous times people don't want it reinforced but want to be reminded of the good things in this world.  What impressed me, though, which wasn't mentioned in too many of the other reviews is the towering work of Eduardo Verastegui as Jose.

1145861,A1EAFFJQ2NDHGC,B0014BQR6U,Eric J. Anderson,"[5, 5]","Bella is the best movie I've seen all year. Oddly, the origin of the movie was the intention of the writers/producers to make a film that presents a positive role model of strong Latino families (in this case, a family of Puerto Rican/Mexican origin). It also has a strong pro-life message. But often when filmmakers set out to send a message, the art gets compromised on the way to beating you over the head with it. The Ultimate Gift for example, while it didn't completely beat you over the head, did seem more contrived, and the lead's acting wasn't always tops.Every good movie is of necessity a contrivance. The trick is to make it seem utterly natural, living and breathing. That's a function of the script and acting. There's a very short scene in Bella with two brothers -- in the beginning, there isn't even any dialogue. They just sit at the counter eating, and one elbows the other, the other elbows the first brother back, back and forth, back and forth. It tells more than words ever could. Simple,  natural, and it rings perfectly true. The whole movie has that sort of effortless genuine feeling. The family message and the pro-life message is preached in the softest way, like those pro-life TV commercials the Mormons ran a few years ago.The majority of Bella takes place in the space of a day and a half. A restaurant on the streets of New York is preparing for a big meal, the boss ordering all the staff around. We see a young woman at the drugstore, then at home, taking a pregnancy test -- Nina is a waitress at the restaurant, and when she finally gets to work, the boss complains that this is her third time late, and she's fired. The chef at the restaurant (the boss's brother), witnesses this. Nina runs off, but she's dropped something, and the chef picks it up and runs after her. He spends the day with Nina, and being a friend to her in time of need will change both of their lives...A great deal of the artfulness of this movie is how much is left out of the story of the two main characters. The chef had a major disaster in his life a few years before, an accident that derailed his life plans and it still haunts him. We see the incident in some relatively brief flashbacks. And Nina tells a bit of her life story, but without a lot of detail. The ending is also very subtle and not completely fleshed out. It only shows what you need to see for the emotional resolution of the story.Bella won the Toronto International Film Festival's People's Choice Award in 2006, an honor given to films like Chariots of Fire, Strictly Ballroom, Hotel Rwanda, The Princess Bride, and The Big Chill. It deserves to be in that league.If this isn't enough to recommend it, it is also a family movie, without sleaze and language, featuring characters who model the values of family, respect, kindness, and helping others.",5,combines a moral message with high artistic execution,1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,2839,"['Bella', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'Oddly', 'origin', 'movie', 'was', 'intention', 'writers/producers', 'make', 'film', 'positive', 'role', 'model', 'strong', 'Latino', 'families', 'case', 'family', 'Puerto', 'Rican/Mexican', 'origin', 'also', 'strong', 'pro-life', 'message', 'often', 'when', 'filmmakers', 'set', 'out', 'send', 'message', 'art', 'compromised', 'way', 'beating', 'head', 'Ultimate', 'Gift', 'example', 'did', ""n't"", 'completely', 'beat', 'head', 'did', 'seem', 'more', 'contrived', 'lead', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'tops.Every', 'good', 'movie', 'necessity', 'contrivance', 'trick', 'make', 'seem', 'utterly', 'natural', 'living', 'breathing', 'function', 'script', 'acting', 'very', 'short', 'scene', 'Bella', 'two', 'brothers', 'beginning', ""n't"", 'even', 'dialogue', 'just', 'sit', 'counter', 'eating', 'one', 'other', 'other', 'first', 'brother', 'back', 'back', 'forth', 'back', 'forth', 'more', 'words', 'ever', 'could', 'Simple', 'natural', 'perfectly', 'true', 'whole', 'movie', 'sort', 'effortless', 'genuine', 'feeling', 'family', 'message', 'pro-life', 'message', 'preached', 'softest', 'way', 'pro-life', 'TV', 'commercials', 'Mormons', 'ran', 'few', 'years', 'ago.The', 'majority', 'Bella', 'place', 'space', 'day', 'half', 'restaurant', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'preparing', 'big', 'meal', 'boss', 'ordering', 'staff', 'around', 'see', 'young', 'woman', 'drugstore', 'then', 'home', 'taking', 'pregnancy', 'test', 'Nina', 'waitress', 'restaurant', 'when', 'finally', 'work', 'boss', 'third', 'time', 'late', 'fired', 'chef', 'restaurant', 'boss', 'brother', 'Nina', 'dropped', 'something', 'chef', 'up', 'runs', 'day', 'Nina', 'being', 'friend', 'time', 'need', 'will', 'change', 'lives', 'A', 'great', 'deal', 'artfulness', 'movie', 'how', 'much', 'left', 'story', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'chef', 'had', 'major', 'disaster', 'life', 'few', 'years', 'before', 'accident', 'derailed', 'life', 'plans', 'still', 'see', 'incident', 'relatively', 'brief', 'flashbacks', 'Nina', 'bit', 'life', 'story', 'lot', 'detail', 'ending', 'also', 'very', 'subtle', 'not', 'completely', 'fleshed', 'out', 'only', 'what', 'need', 'see', 'emotional', 'resolution', 'story.Bella', 'won', 'Toronto', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'People', 'Choice', 'Award', '2006', 'honor', 'given', 'films', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'Strictly', 'Ballroom', 'Hotel', 'Rwanda', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'Big', 'Chill', 'be', 'league.If', ""n't"", 'enough', 'recommend', 'also', 'family', 'movie', 'sleaze', 'language', 'featuring', 'characters', 'who', 'model', 'values', 'family', 'respect', 'kindness', 'helping', 'others']",N/A

So we brought it home on DVD tonight to watch with our teen daughter and her boyfriend. ""What's it about?"" she wanted to know. I tried to explain it was about a Mexican soccer star who's done jail time, and a NY waitress who's pregnant and loses her job...And then I said, ""Just watch it with us. If you're bored to tears after fifteen minutes, then go do something else.""This litmus test seemed to work. We sat through the movie, laughing, getting teary-eyed, and warmed by this story's simple passion and grace. ""Bella"" is shot with great love for its characters. Even the unlikeable ones become special by the end. Following mostly one day in the lives of Jose (soccer-star-turned-chef) and Nina (waitress-and-expecting), it's hard not to become wrapped up in their pasts, their burdens, their hopes, and their hesitant dreams. Together, they build upon a friendship that will give them both a chance at redemption. The way these elements come together is subtle and magical.From the humorous scenes around the dinner table, to the heart-wrenching flashback, to the understated conclusion, ""Bella"" is near perfection. Watching it a second time, I was awed by the gentle economy of every shot, every scene, and each facial expression. While I loved ""Juno"" for its edge and endless wit, ""Bella"" deals with the issue of unwanted pregnancy too, and does so with its own unique charm.In the last year, this has to rate in my top five favorite films.

1145865,A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M,B0014BQR6U,e. verrillo,"[2, 10]","Bella is supposed to be a heartwarming film about love, redemption and family. A chef, and former soccer star, Jose, makes a fateful decision to follow a waitress who has just been fired from his brother's restaurant, changing both of their lives forever. Although the reason he follows her is never made clear, eventually you figure out that he is looking for a way to redeem himself for a tragedy that has ruined his life.The film's message is fairly clear--love of family wins in the end--but how it gets there is a mystery. One minute, Jose and Nina are sitting on the beach getting to know one another, the next minute it's years later and everything has worked out just fine. How was the fundamental crisis resolved? Shouldn't we have seen the drama? The neat, and entirely too pat, ending seemed like it was pulled out of thin air.Jose's family was also pulled out of thin air. The mother is Latina (Mexican)and a fluent speaker of English. The father is a non-English speaking Puerto Rican. Two of the sons speak English fluently, while the third, Jose, has a heavy accent. So, where were the kids raised? If in the States, then all three would be fluent. If in Mexico, then all three would have a Spanish accent. I have the feeling that the producers thought, ""Hah! Dumb gringos! They'll never know the difference!"" (And, while we're on the subject of dumb gringos, why does a Mexican soccer star have an Argentinian agent? Mexicans are entirely too nationalistic for that kind of shenanigan.)The ""Watch me pull rabbit out of my hat!"" character of this film is no doubt due to the fact the Verastegui, a devout Catholic, is on a one-man mission to ""save"" Hollywood. He had originally volunteered to do missionary work in the jungles of Brazil (why is it always Brazil?), but then decided that Hollywood, that hotbed of sin, was more of a challenge. The fact that this film was basically propaganda, in the original sense of the word (to propagate the faith), accounts for why the acting was so bad, the script so minimal, and the plot so contrived. But I will say that if the gorgeous, intense and thoroughly  sexy Verastegui ever does manage to produce a good movie, then get in line, because there will probably be a rush to the confessional.",2,"Sweet in a sentimental sort of way,  but with a big gaping hole towards the end...",1258761600,"11 21, 2009",2009,2253,"['Bella', 'supposed', 'be', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'love', 'redemption', 'family', 'chef', 'former', 'soccer', 'star', 'Jose', 'fateful', 'decision', 'follow', 'waitress', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'fired', 'brother', 'restaurant', 'changing', 'lives', 'forever', 'reason', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'eventually', 'figure', 'out', 'looking', 'way', 'redeem', 'tragedy', 'ruined', 'life.The', 'film', 'message', 'fairly', 'clear', 'love', 'family', 'wins', 'end', 'how', 'mystery', 'One', 'minute', 'Jose', 'Nina', 'are', 'sitting', 'beach', 'getting', 'know', 'one', 'next', 'minute', 'years', 'later', 'everything', 'worked', 'out', 'just', 'fine', 'How', 'was', 'fundamental', 'crisis', 'resolved', 'Should', ""n't"", 'have', 'seen', 'drama', 'neat', 'entirely', 'too', 'pat', 'ending', 'seemed', 'was', 'pulled', 'thin', 'air.Jose', 'family', 'was', 'also', 'pulled', 'out', 'thin', 'air', 'mother', 'Latina', 'Mexican', 'fluent', 'speaker', 'English', 'father', 'non-English', 'speaking', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'Two', 'sons', 'speak', 'English', 'fluently', 'third', 'Jose', 'heavy', 'accent', 'So', 'where', 'were', 'kids', 'raised', 'States', 'then', 'three', 'would', 'be', 'fluent', 'Mexico', 'then', 'three', 'would', 'have', 'Spanish', 'accent', 'have', 'feeling', 'producers', 'thought', 'Hah', 'Dumb', 'gringos', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'difference', ""'re"", 'subject', 'dumb', 'gringos', 'why', 'Mexican', 'soccer', 'star', 'have', 'Argentinian', 'agent', 'Mexicans', 'are', 'entirely', 'too', 'nationalistic', 'kind', 'shenanigan', 'Watch', 'pull', 'rabbit', 'hat', 'character', 'film', 'doubt', 'due', 'fact', 'Verastegui', 'devout', 'Catholic', 'one-man', 'mission', 'save', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'originally', 'volunteered', 'do', 'missionary', 'work', 'jungles', 'Brazil', 'why', 'always', 'Brazil', 'then', 'decided', 'Hollywood', 'hotbed', 'sin', 'was', 'more', 'challenge', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'basically', 'propaganda', 'original', 'sense', 'word', 'propagate', 'faith', 'accounts', 'why', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'script', 'so', 'minimal', 'plot', 'so', 'contrived', 'will', 'say', 'gorgeous', 'intense', 'thoroughly', 'sexy', 'Verastegui', 'ever', 'manage', 'produce', 'good', 'movie', 'then', 'get', 'line', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'rush', 'confessional']",N/A

1145868,A3DQQ5L75KQTPP,B0014BQR6U,"Gulshan Batra ""(GB)""","[6, 6]","""Bella"" is one of those movies that make you want to believe in goodness of people and the purpose of life. It may move you to tears, or not - but what's certain is that you won't get away unaffected.The story of a soccer star, whose career ends before it begins, and of the NY waitress, who is left to face the music alone by her boyfriend when she becomes pregnant, is captured brilliantly in this movie. The shots capture the poignance of the moment in the movie, and in fact, at times, capture the myriad colors that life has to offer us. When Jose's soccer dreams are crashed by an unexpected event, he loses all his life's passion, and ends up being a reserved-but-extremely-respected chef in his brother Manny's restaurant in NY. There, he meets Nina, who is a waitress in the same restaurant, and the two are good friends.One fine day, things just begin to break down for Nina, and seeing her in distress, Jose reaches out to her, and bonds instantly. However, this is where I must put on record my disagreement with the movie. The kind of bonding that Jose enjoys with Nina in a day, while entirely possible, is the less convincing, primarily because of the little background shown about the two characters before the particular day. With each passing moment, we are made to realize how otherwise close these two actually are. While it doesn't take anything from the movie, it certainly takes away a little attention which would otherwise go to marvel at the magnificient story-telling of the movie.Be that as it may, what transpires in that day in Jose's and Nina's life makes them both happy, and in the long run, gives them a purpose for life itself.Most of us go through life without realizing that it is our only chance at being happy, and that happiness might not always come from expeted quarters or directions only. It's our sole responsibility to seek out our happiness, and reward ourselves with it. ""Bella"" seeks to reinforce this adage, and encourages to seek out happiness, not just for ourselves but for those beloved to us.My favorite moment: TOW the street peddlar is selling an origami creation to Nina, and when she says she doesn't have any money, he simply asks her to describe the buautiful day to him; only then does Nina (and the audience) realize that he is blind, but ever eager to savor life's rainbows.Overall Rating: 4 / 5",4,"A touching story, brilliantly portrayed!",1220227200,"09 1, 2008",2008,2359,"['Bella', 'one', 'movies', 'make', 'want', 'believe', 'goodness', 'people', 'purpose', 'life', 'may', 'move', 'tears', 'not', 'what', 'certain', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'unaffected.The', 'story', 'soccer', 'star', 'career', 'NY', 'waitress', 'who', 'left', 'face', 'music', 'alone', 'boyfriend', 'when', 'pregnant', 'captured', 'brilliantly', 'movie', 'shots', 'capture', 'poignance', 'moment', 'movie', 'fact', 'times', 'capture', 'myriad', 'colors', 'life', 'offer', 'When', 'Jose', 'soccer', 'dreams', 'are', 'crashed', 'unexpected', 'event', 'life', 'passion', 'up', 'being', 'reserved-but-extremely-respected', 'chef', 'brother', 'Manny', 'restaurant', 'NY', 'Nina', 'who', 'waitress', 'same', 'restaurant', 'two', 'are', 'good', 'friends.One', 'fine', 'day', 'things', 'just', 'begin', 'break', 'down', 'Nina', 'seeing', 'distress', 'Jose', 'out', 'bonds', 'instantly', 'However', 'where', 'must', 'put', 'record', 'disagreement', 'movie', 'kind', 'bonding', 'Jose', 'Nina', 'day', 'entirely', 'possible', 'less', 'convincing', 'primarily', 'little', 'background', 'shown', 'two', 'characters', 'particular', 'day', 'passing', 'moment', 'are', 'made', 'realize', 'how', 'otherwise', 'close', 'two', 'actually', 'are', ""n't"", 'take', 'anything', 'movie', 'certainly', 'away', 'little', 'attention', 'would', 'otherwise', 'go', 'marvel', 'magnificient', 'story-telling', 'movie.Be', 'may', 'what', 'day', 'Jose', 'Nina', 'life', 'happy', 'long', 'run', 'purpose', 'life', 'itself.Most', 'go', 'life', 'realizing', 'only', 'chance', 'being', 'happy', 'happiness', 'might', 'not', 'always', 'come', 'expeted', 'quarters', 'directions', 'only', 'sole', 'responsibility', 'seek', 'out', 'happiness', 'reward', 'Bella', 'reinforce', 'adage', 'seek', 'out', 'happiness', 'not', 'just', 'ourselves', 'beloved', 'us.My', 'favorite', 'moment', 'TOW', 'street', 'peddlar', 'selling', 'origami', 'creation', 'Nina', 'when', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'simply', 'describe', 'buautiful', 'day', 'only', 'then', 'Nina', 'audience', 'realize', 'blind', 'ever', 'eager', 'savor', 'life', 'rainbows.Overall', 'Rating', '4', '/', '5']",N/A

This is BELLA, heartfelt and searing and powerful. It hits deep. It tells the story of two wounded people, strangers to each other, who happen to spend time together for the span of one day and whose lives are consequently altered.BELLA strikes a chord early on, from the moment we see this bearded, introspective man sitting on the beach. His name is Jose (Eduardo Verastegui) and, five years ago, he was on the brink of a promising soccer career - before the tragedy, which torments him to this very day. Today, soccer forever behind him, Jose toils in New York as a chef in his brother's Latin restaurant. Nina (Tammy Blanchard) also works there, as a waitress. But, lately, Nina has been sick or late to work. Today, she finds out she's pregnant. Shortly after, she gets fired. Jose, who barely knows her, feels concern and follows her to offer a measure of comfort. For the rest of the day, they end up hanging out and talking and just living life.It's a simple story, but so evocatively told. The cast is never less than perfect, with the two leads Verastegui and Blanchard breaking out with very emotional, terrifically sympathetic performances and with their pitch-perfect chemistry. These two exemplify the fragility in us, the pain and the loss, the hope and the seeking of second chances. And, how, sometimes, all it takes to get back on track is a supportive word or a kind ear or a helping hand from a stranger. I had never heard of this movie, and I definitely wasn't prepared for the impact it had on me. I couldn't tear my eyes away. BELLA is beautiful, these characters are beautiful - even Manny, the guy we all start out detesting; even he ends up in our good graces.BELLA is tragic, but it's also ultimately uplifting. Certainly there's a love of family strongly seen and felt on screen, and the world would be a better place if everyone had a wonderful family like Jose's. So, definitely, it's a love story. But it's not a romance. Nina and Jose, in opening up to each other, become close in a short amount of time, but their relationship seems to be a platonic one, more of a deep friendship. In a way, this makes the story even more affecting and compelling, with the absence of the romantic crutch. And, in that light, what Jose does near the end of the film seems even more generous and, yes, loving.This is an underdog film in every way. It's independent cinema, the director, writers, and producers are a bunch of nobodies, and the actors are little known. But this picture brims over with heart and soul; and it's palpable, the care and commitment and pure faith invested by these folks who lovingly made the film. BELLA tells of a day in the life, and how life starts all over again after one single day. BELLA begins with a kind gesture and it ends in redemption. What happens in between is a kind of magic found when two people unexpectedly connect. This movie deserves to be seen.

Director Monteverde deliberately keeps his audience in suspense as to what decision the character of Nina will make with regard to her unwanted pregnancy or if the character of Jose will ever emerge from the shadows of guilt and depression.  Both the tragic and the hopeful narrative lines are kept open until the movie abruptly ends.  The movie ends where it began, on the beach, but what at first seemed a tragic tale, turns out to be a hopeful new beginning for Jose, Nina, and child.  We are not doomed to repeat tragic pasts (a recurring theme in Latin-American literature)but can find hope in other parts of our life experience.  The character of the older brother, Manny, is the a chief antagonist early on who becomes the surprise emblem of redemption in the film's final act.  My only complaint with this film is that it was too short to do justice to all of the nuanced characters we are introduced to.

People are busy; they're hectic; they're like a moving clock, all moving fast and doing their own thing, not noticing one another.""I wish I could see that,"" says the smiling blind man.This, in a scene, describes what director Alejandro Gomez Monteverde is driving at throughout Bella. In this world, everyone has multiple options. There is often the view that we can look at the world as dark and full of despair and focus on what we don't have, or we can look at the world through the lens of joy, opting to view our daily struggles as a chance for hope to find us.Bella is a lovely film, which, although at times heavily character-driven, leaves the viewer better off for having watched it. Some might consider it a political or agenda-driven film. I didn't see it that way at all. To me, Bella represents another voice in a world, which largely projects one option, and this new voice is one that refreshingly offers hope to everyone in a very non-intrusive way.You can make a case for this being considered a God film. If you did, however, you would first have to admit that this is the first such film done in a way that leaves us victimized neither by a Christian agenda nor by the pathetic waves of poorly crafted screenplay and underlying thought. For me, I was actually happy when I finished watching Bella, and considering the new barrage of independent films with dark subtext, that is a rarity.",4,"""God closed my eyes.

It's a good show, but despite so many good elements and areas of representation, it failed as an end product. Taken as fragments, each element was good as individual subject matter--for example, neighborhood culture of NY, the bond of family, race relations, the carefree yet intense NY scenes. But the way the characters were not allowed to take responsibility of their lives, and the erratic behavior of the protagonist were not exactly something you see in real life. I really get the whole idea of healing, friendship and compassion, but just because the effort and theme were there, does not mean it was well-done as a total package. A realistic review should judge a movie as a finished product, not only by a theme.Death of a young girl by accident and the trauma to live with that for all involved certainly win sympathy; but it seems that most of the audience here had voted the idea, the concept, the tragic story, forgetting how well THE MOVIE itself was done--its transition from scene to scene, its ability to create strong sense of plausibility in real life situation and such.The story is moving, no doubt, the movie itself was not that good.You can spend the time watching better ones.",3,"A very good idea, but a movie should be more than an idea",1313798400,"08 20, 2011",2011,1295,"['hesitate', 'write', 'three', 'star', 'review', 'amidst', 'large', 'number', 'five-star', 'comments', 'good', 'show', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'elements', 'areas', 'representation', 'failed', 'end', 'product', 'Taken', 'fragments', 'element', 'was', 'good', 'individual', 'subject', 'matter', 'example', 'neighborhood', 'culture', 'NY', 'bond', 'family', 'race', 'relations', 'carefree', 'yet', 'intense', 'NY', 'scenes', 'way', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'allowed', 'take', 'responsibility', 'lives', 'erratic', 'behavior', 'protagonist', 'were', 'not', 'exactly', 'something', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'really', 'get', 'whole', 'idea', 'healing', 'friendship', 'compassion', 'just', 'effort', 'theme', 'were', 'there', 'not', 'mean', 'was', 'well-done', 'total', 'package', 'A', 'realistic', 'review', 'should', 'judge', 'movie', 'finished', 'product', 'not', 'only', 'theme.Death', 'young', 'girl', 'accident', 'trauma', 'live', 'involved', 'certainly', 'win', 'sympathy', 'most', 'audience', 'here', 'had', 'voted', 'idea', 'concept', 'tragic', 'story', 'forgetting', 'how', 'well', 'MOVIE', 'was', 'done', 'transition', 'scene', 'scene', 'ability', 'create', 'strong', 'sense', 'plausibility', 'real', 'life', 'situation', 'such.The', 'story', 'moving', 'doubt', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'good.You', 'can', 'spend', 'time', 'watching', 'better', 'ones']",N/A

Because it was promoted by pro-life and religious groups, I wondered if it would be stronger in message and weaker in art.This film is a slow moving unveiling of wounded characters that are so full of longing, fear and regret that they limp through life with crudely constructed walls to protect their crushed hearts. Does anyone really know either of them? Apparently not.Nina is terrified and pregnant and newly unemployed. Jose enters the picture as a friend when she needs one the most.One day plays out but past and future appear throughout the day in memories and conversation. A final  scene pulls the film together. Interactions with other characters enrich the film. Not only do we understand Nina and Jose, but we are given glimpses into the choices and relationships of secondary characters.Fans of quick action movies are going to want to pass. Much of this film is characters talking and doing little else. This is a rich study of the strengths and weaknesses in humanity. The acting is impressive. The story of friendship and grace is powerful.If you are looking for poignancy and a movie that will make you think, I believe you'll find those qualities in Bella.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[6, 6]","Eduardo Verastegui and Tammy Blanchard give brilliantly moving performances in the sweet but serious ""Bella.""  It's the story of two people who become close friends due to a series of life-changing events.  Blanchard plays Nina, a recently fired mother-to-be who befriends Jose (Verastegui), a former-soccer-star-turned cook.  The pair spend the day together as Nina is debating on whether or not to keep her baby.  As the story unfolds, we learn a lot about both of them.  Nina meets Jose's wonderful family who have a great life together.  Jose opens up to Nina about his past, and why he's a cook and not playing professional soccer.  In the end, the pair share something that's greater than any run-of-the-mill love story ending.""Bella"" features an excellent cast that includes Manny Perez as Jose's restaurant-running brother.  Ali Landry has a brief role in the film, but gives one of the most heart-tugging performances in the film.  When Nina (and viewers) is introduced to Jose's family, the performances of the actors show just how powerful family bonds can be presented on the screen.Director Alejandro Monteverde keeps things moving at a slow (but never boring) pace.  The viewer is given just enough pieces of the puzzle to keep them interested in the story and just enough hints to make them wonder as to what happened to Jose that ended his soccer career.  The music is also very nice.The film received a PG-13 rating for thematic elements and brief disturbing images.  The primary topic at hand is abortion, so there's nothing light about the thematic elements.  The disturbing images come via Jose's confession as to what happened to him that made him go to work for his brother.  Young children should not see these images.  They are executed to perfection and will move many people to tears, especially if you have a family.  There's also a deep and refreshing Catholic undertone to the whole story.In the end, I'm betting that people will either love this film for being so positive or hate it for what they might perceive as being preachy.  Whichever camp you might reside in, do give ""Bella"" a chance.  It's a positive film in a world that's littered with negatives.

It can happen in a split second before you've even realized the implications.  Jose played by Eduardo Verastegui who was in ""Chasing Papi"" in 2003 does an excellent job.  We see him first looking almost homeless, ragged enough to make a parent get his children away from him.  As the story unfolds and we learn what happened on the day he went to sign his big soccer contract, we see the world shift.  The father describes how one needs passion to play soccer.  Clearly, the experience Jose went through has drained him.Then we join him on the job as a chef working for his brother Manny.  Manny is played by Manny Perez, who has a rough exterior, all business, and not very kind to his employees.  Nina is a waitress and has been absent, experiencing the effect of pregnancy.  Manny fires her, not knowing the story.  Jose befriends her.  ""Bella"" is basically a film about their day together.  Jose takes Nina to his home.  Nina is played by Tammy Blanchard who played Judy Garland in a movie of the week and appeared inThe Good Shepherd (Widescreen Edition).  She does an excellent job as the waitress, feeling a thousand pressures as she tries to earn her way in New York City.  Angelica Aragon who played with Anthony Quinn & Keeanu Reeves inA Walk in the Cloudsplays Jose's mother.  Ramon Rodriguez plays his little brother Eduardo.  Ultimately, this is a film that supports adoptive parents and speaks of compassion and understanding as qualities as vital to life as air, food & shelter.

It is a breath of fresh air in today's society - one which is plagued with overwhelming use of sex, extreme violence, gore, and profanity filling our choices on the big screen. This film has NONE of that - and for that, they deserve the highest praise!If you really want to have the best experience of this film, I suggest that you do not read the reviews which give away most of the story. Although difficult, I have tried not to tell family and friends what the movie is about in any detail, and that is because of my own experience viewing it for the first time with no pre-conceived notions. It is powerfully moving - particularly in the places where the story turns in unexpected directions. Let yourself be ""surprised"" - you will not be sorry, and you will be greatly uplifted when the film has reached its conclusion.What I WILL tell you is that this film is a great celebration of our God-given gift of life.

It's definitely a love story: a love for life, for family, for those in need- especially those who need help without strings attached.The premise involves a world-class soccer player(Jose) whose life is tragically altered along with his mind and emotions in grief(thus flashbacks)who now works in his brother's, Manny, run restaurant.  A waitress there gets fired for tardiness, and Jose tries to help.  It's one meaningful, life changing day together, eventually climaxing with his Puerto Rican/Mexican family, and ending up back on the beach.The actors are very good.  Jose(Eduardo Verastequi) is incredibly sensitive, often just observing and listening and simply being there, at times breaking down, but then, letting go.  He's a handsome dude, especially, without the Cat Stevens beard.  Nina (Tammy Blanchard), the waitress, portrays well the vulnerbility needed for Eduardo's character.  She bounces between angry and scared, lost and hopeful, insecure and supportive.  She wants the quick fix, and unrealistically, a knight to solve her problems.  Jose may or may not be that man of steel.  His relationships are colorful, full of 'every family' quirks; however, Manny shines as the worldly driven, Type-A who can't get beyond himself and smell the roses or paella.  He brings humor and glimpses of repressed sentimentality.The story flows as a journey for the leads; a building paean for existence, for dealing with death, for relying on others, whether they're the less than perfect family, friends or even strangers,and that we all suffer pain and make mistakes, but the greatest mistake is to give up on life and each other, even the unborn.5 stars for good characters, story development, message; 4 stars for some shortcomings, e.g., why the jail term for Jose, why absolutely no friends, no remaining family, no possiblity of other work, no nada para pobre Nina?  Without being mawkish, there's manipulation going on in the plot, but the sense of genuine warmth and decency makes it forgivable.Final synopsis: The waitress feels her fragile world is collapsing, the soccer player feels his has collapsed, and all parties together find a redemption of sorts.

There is only good, bad and the plot hinges on the confused, middle-gound, characters as they spend the movie picking a side, staying true to their identities and picking up their failed lives. That is pretty much it. Good characters are disheveled and pick up teddy bears and sign soccer balls, whiles bad ones are blond, tall skinny women who express blatant stereotypes out loud or are Alpha male want-to-be's that yell out orders in a kitchen. Simple and one dimensional.Other problems I had was with the jerky, distracting cinematography. I understand the budget was low and filming time was brief, but that does not justify the constant pacing around of the camera. I.E. when two characters are talking in a car the camera cuts to a loud NYC traffic moment from the point of view of a tire or traffic light and cuts back to a close up of the characters face as the face is jerking around.

As the title states, it is a film about love that is deeply rooted love between friends and family.  And it is a film about living, then losing, but regaining the American dream; we see the dream lived by one Puerto Rican-Mexican American family, which reveals their rich culture of family, food, language, and religion.  Although most of the film is spoken in English, there are a few scenes in Spanish accompanied with subtitles.  And it is fitting that the film takes place within the so-called melting pot that is New York City.BELLA runs a little over 90 minutes, but there are plenty of complexities within the storyline.  The film also confronts the issue of perceptions, and how people perceive one another without complete communication.  As the film proceeds, the character's stories are intricately told in quick snapshots.  The most interesting aspect of the film is how it starts at a fast pace revealing fragments of the main characters' lives, Jose (Eduardo Verastegui), a Chef, and Nina (Tammy Blanchard), a waitress, who work for Jose's brother, Manny (Manny Perez).  One day Nina is 20 minutes late for work because she was very ill; unfortunately she gets fired without having to completely explain her situation -- she's pregnant.  And this incident begins the film, and Nina's constant pondering of what to do with the rest of her life, keep the child or abort it, and Jose confronting his demons of a past life he left behind four years ago.There are plenty of moving scenes in the film that tug at the heartstrings.  However, there are two scenes that stood out.  One of them is when Nina and Jose walk along the street and talk to a blind man who makes paper origami figures, and offers Nina a figure that looks like a frog.  Not knowing that he is blind, it is only when he asks Nina to describe to him what the city streets look like, that she realizes his blindness, and the second is the surprise ending of the film.  It is scenes like these that make the littlest or biggest tokens of kindness more meaningful in one's life.Alejandro Gomez Monteverde wrote and directed Bella, and the film won the People's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival.  After watching the film, it is worthy of an Academy Award nomination as well.  Indeed, this is a gem of a film that any movie viewer may want to get a glimpse because of its excellent storytelling and film making.",5,A Film That May Move You To Tears,1196467200,"12 1, 2007",2007,2526,"['BELLA', 'one', 'unpredictable', 'films', 'usually', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'noticed', 'array', 'movie', 'choices', 'watch', 'title', 'states', 'film', 'love', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'love', 'friends', 'family', 'film', 'living', 'then', 'losing', 'regaining', 'American', 'dream', 'see', 'dream', 'lived', 'one', 'Puerto', 'Rican-Mexican', 'American', 'family', 'rich', 'culture', 'family', 'food', 'language', 'religion', 'most', 'film', 'spoken', 'English', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'Spanish', 'accompanied', 'subtitles', 'fitting', 'film', 'place', 'so-called', 'melting', 'pot', 'New', 'York', 'City.BELLA', 'little', '90', 'minutes', 'are', 'plenty', 'complexities', 'storyline', 'film', 'also', 'issue', 'perceptions', 'how', 'people', 'perceive', 'one', 'complete', 'communication', 'film', 'proceeds', 'character', 'stories', 'are', 'intricately', 'told', 'quick', 'snapshots', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'film', 'how', 'fast', 'pace', 'revealing', 'fragments', 'main', 'characters', 'lives', 'Jose', 'Eduardo', 'Verastegui', 'Chef', 'Nina', 'Tammy', 'Blanchard', 'waitress', 'who', 'work', 'Jose', 'brother', 'Manny', 'Manny', 'Perez', 'One', 'day', 'Nina', '20', 'minutes', 'late', 'work', 'was', 'very', 'ill', 'unfortunately', 'fired', 'having', 'completely', 'explain', 'situation', 'pregnant', 'incident', 'film', 'Nina', 'constant', 'pondering', 'what', 'do', 'rest', 'life', 'keep', 'child', 'abort', 'Jose', 'confronting', 'demons', 'past', 'life', 'left', 'behind', 'four', 'years', 'ago.There', 'are', 'plenty', 'moving', 'scenes', 'film', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'However', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'stood', 'out', 'One', 'when', 'Nina', 'Jose', 'walk', 'street', 'talk', 'blind', 'man', 'who', 'paper', 'origami', 'figures', 'Nina', 'figure', 'frog', 'Not', 'knowing', 'blind', 'only', 'when', 'Nina', 'describe', 'what', 'city', 'streets', 'look', 'blindness', 'second', 'surprise', 'ending', 'film', 'scenes', 'make', 'littlest', 'biggest', 'tokens', 'kindness', 'more', 'meaningful', 'one', 'life.Alejandro', 'Gomez', 'Monteverde', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Bella', 'film', 'won', 'People', 'Choice', 'Award', 'Toronto', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'watching', 'film', 'worthy', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'as', 'well', 'Indeed', 'gem', 'film', 'movie', 'viewer', 'may', 'want', 'get', 'glimpse', 'excellent', 'storytelling', 'film', 'making']",N/A

Everyone is stunned by the unexpected firing but even more when the restaurant chef walks out from the kitchen minutes before lunch hour rush.

Nina is sure that abortion is the only way for her to solve her problems.  Jose has flashbacks to a terrible accident that changed the course of his life forever, but also made him more open to looking at the people around him, and making him care for them.  Nina and Jose spend the day together, finding out about each other's pasts, dreams they both had, and becoming friends.  Jose trying to convince Nina that her baby deserves a chance to live, and that if she doesn't want to be a mom, she should at least give it up for adoption vs an abortion.My two cents worth  I liked it.  The movie was a bit fast paced in my opinion, with lots of flashbacks and flash forwards (in most movies you don't often see where the characters imagine what might happen).  It made it a bit hard for me to keep up, I did understand it all when the film was done, but it just seemed a bit choppy some times.  Scene changes were a bit dramatic sometimes too, often with a bit  of extra noise, or flashes of light.  This didn't make it bad, just a bit startling sometimes.  I think that the accident scene (I won't spoil it and tell you what happened) was well done, it gave you enough details  that you understand what happened, and you feel great empathy for those involved, but you don't go away sick because there are too many details.  The ending is great!! Not exactly what I expected, but very happy.  It also left a bit to the imagination (there were 4 of us watching it, and we didn't all agree with what the ending meant. . .  that is nice sometimes).Over all, I liked the movie, honestly wouldn't pick it as a movie to watch over and over, but I wouldn't have a problem watching it a second time either.  There were also no sex scenes or swearing - a big bonus for meRated PG (due to the accident scene I think. . .)*Note:  I am writing this review because I want to; no one connected to this movie or Amazon.com has paid me to write it.

Nina and Jose spend a desultory afternoon roaming around town, discussing Nina's options and exploring the horrific tragedy that forever changed the course of Jose's life, an event that, in some ways, touches on the decision Nina has to make, and that, in part at least, explains Jose's indescribably awful beard.""Bella""'s most distinctive trait is its almost total lack of artifice, the completely naturalistic way in which it chooses to tell its story.

I don't care how well intentioned film makers are if they do not know their craft.That said, I liked this movie. The lead actress did a very credible job. In its totality this movie isn't Oscar quality, nor is it as good as Arranged, another Indie film with a religious theme. But I still liked the story, and was interested in what happened to the characters. It was not without subtle spiritual moments, such as when Eduardo's character tells Tammy's character not to judge his nasty brother too harshly - he had helped him when he was down. (Eduardo relies on that goodness when he leaves work that day.) The film was ostensibly about the value of one human life - Tammy's child. But it was also about the strength of Eduardo's family and their love for each other.

We stay in step with Jos&eacute; and Nina as their story unfolds.There is a moment late in the movie when Jos&eacute; says, ""I'll call you....I'll call you, OK?""  Don't let that slip by unnoticed, as I first did.You will notice some idealizing, and the careful choice and balance of characters.  You may well ponder the message of the homeless man, that delightful sidewalk seer.  When it comes to design, ""Bella"" is more like a sonnet than a news report.Then, the emotional intensity.  Tears flow.  Overdone?  Maybe, but we can hardly expect English reserve in a Latino-themed film.  The music contributes appropriately, sometimes very gently, to the emotional tone.Some defects we'll just have to forgive:  loose threads, imperfect seams.

1145925,A1C80B497LCYKA,B0014BQR6U,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[3, 3]","Two films that tackle the difficult question of how to deal with an unwanted pregnancy are the 2006 film Bella, starring Eduardo Verastegui and Tammy Blanchard, and the 1963 classic Love With The Proper Stranger, starring Steve McQueen and Natalie Wood. Both films are wonderful for different reasons. I give Bella 4 stars overall. I give Love With The Proper Stranger 5 stars simply for the script and acting, which are superb.In Bella, directed by Alejandro Gomez Monteverde, Verastegui is a cook that has to overcome a tremendous setback: in a previous time of life, he was a soccer star that was involved in a car accident on the day he was turning pro - ending his career when he has to do time in prison. Now he is working in his older brother's restaurant, just trying to ""find himself."" Meanwhile, one of the waitresses in the restaurant (Blanchard) is fired for being late and supposedly drunk, but it turns out she's pregnant. She decides an abortion is the only way to deal with the issue because she will not bring a child into a loveless life like hers. But Verastegui is her friend, and will not allow her to deal with this crisis alone. Over the course of a day spent together, Verastegui shows her a lot of love, helping her find a new job and taking her to meet his family - one that is very proud and rich in heritage. Blanchard has no family, so the love she experiences with his overwhelms her - and changes her.In Love With The Proper Stranger, directed by Robert Mulligan, McQueen is a musician that has to face the responsibility of having gotten a girl he can barely remember (Natalie Wood) pregnant; and Wood has to decide what to do about it so her overly protective Italian-American family doesn't go berserk. She and McQueen decide to seek an abortion during a time when that was illegal; so it means sneaking around alley ways and dealing with less-than-reputable people. When they come face-to-face with the horrors involved, they change their mind. Plan B for Wood is to marry another man that is in love with her (Tom Bosley), making him fully aware of what he's getting with the deal, but keeping the truth from her family. In the mean time, McQueen has fallen in love with her. But they have a hard time getting along. And Wood has told him that if she can't have ""banjos and bells"" from him - a line from the fantastic theme song by Jack Jones - she's not interested.Both of these films take place in New York City and both are beautifully shot - Bella in very strong color; and Love With The Proper Stranger in black-and-white by Milton R. Krasner, who was nominated for an Oscar. Both are also comedies - which is interesting, considering the subject matter. But it takes humor to cut the seriousness of an issue like abortion. Both couples seriously contemplate abortion, but both change their minds because of love. The big difference between these two films, other than the time periods in which they are set, is the fact that in Bella, the child factors in to the decision; whereas, in Love With The Proper Stranger, it does not. As a matter of fact, the expectant child is not even mentioned, which is strange. The only thing McQueen and Wood are concerned about are their own lives; both Verastegui and Blanchard are concerned primarily with the child.So, you could say that Bella is pro-life, and Love With The Proper Stranger is pro-abortion; except that in both cases, the couples end up doing the right thing. And in Love With The Proper Stranger, the parents of the child end up together. Both films are interesting from the standpoint of how the couples deal with the question both personally and culturally; and both are interesting from the standpoint of how they change. As I said, it is love that changes them in both cases.These are great films for mature audiences. Bella is PG-13 and Love With The Proper Stranger is unrated. As far as awards, Love With The Proper Stranger was nominated for 5 Oscars, including Best Actress for Natalie Wood and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay for Arnold Schulman. Being an independent film, Bella won the Heartland Film Festival Crystal Heart Award, and the Grand Prize for a Dramatic Feature; MovieGuide's Faith and Freedom Award, and their Grace Award for Eduardo Verastegui's acting; and Toronto International Film Festival's People's Choice Award.Waitsel",4,LOVE FOR AN UNBORN CHILD,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,4352,"['Two', 'films', 'tackle', 'difficult', 'question', 'how', 'deal', 'unwanted', 'pregnancy', 'are', '2006', 'film', 'Bella', 'starring', 'Eduardo', 'Verastegui', 'Tammy', 'Blanchard', '1963', 'classic', 'Love', 'Proper', 'Stranger', 'starring', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'films', 'are', 'wonderful', 'different', 'reasons', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'overall', 'give', 'Love', 'Proper', 'Stranger', '5', 'stars', 'simply', 'script', 'acting', 'are', 'superb.In', 'Bella', 'directed', 'Alejandro', 'Gomez', 'Monteverde', 'Verastegui', 'cook', 'overcome', 'tremendous', 'setback', 'previous', 'time', 'life', 'was', 'soccer', 'star', 'was', 'involved', 'car', 'accident', 'day', 'was', 'turning', 'pro', 'ending', 'career', 'when', 'do', 'time', 'prison', 'Now', 'working', 'older', 'brother', 'restaurant', 'just', 'trying', 'find', 'Meanwhile', 'one', 'waitresses', 'restaurant', 'Blanchard', 'fired', 'being', 'late', 'supposedly', 'drunk', 'out', 'pregnant', 'abortion', 'only', 'way', 'deal', 'issue', 'will', 'not', 'bring', 'child', 'loveless', 'life', 'hers', 'Verastegui', 'friend', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'deal', 'crisis', 'alone', 'course', 'day', 'spent', 'together', 'Verastegui', 'lot', 'love', 'helping', 'find', 'new', 'job', 'taking', 'meet', 'family', 'one', 'very', 'proud', 'rich', 'heritage', 'Blanchard', 'family', 'love', 'overwhelms', 'changes', 'her.In', 'Love', 'Proper', 'Stranger', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'McQueen', 'musician', 'face', 'responsibility', 'having', 'gotten', 'girl', 'can', 'barely', 'remember', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'pregnant', 'Wood', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'overly', 'protective', 'Italian-American', 'family', ""n't"", 'go', 'berserk', 'McQueen', 'decide', 'seek', 'abortion', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'illegal', 'sneaking', 'around', 'alley', 'ways', 'dealing', 'less-than-reputable', 'people', 'When', 'come', 'face-to-face', 'horrors', 'involved', 'change', 'mind', 'Plan', 'B', 'Wood', 'marry', 'man', 'love', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'making', 'fully', 'aware', 'what', 'getting', 'deal', 'keeping', 'truth', 'family', 'mean', 'time', 'McQueen', 'fallen', 'love', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'along', 'Wood', 'told', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'banjos', 'bells', 'line', 'fantastic', 'theme', 'song', 'Jack', 'Jones', 'not', 'interested.Both', 'films', 'take', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'are', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Bella', 'very', 'strong', 'color', 'Love', 'Proper', 'Stranger', 'black-and-white', 'Milton', 'R.', 'Krasner', 'who', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'are', 'also', 'comedies', 'interesting', 'considering', 'subject', 'matter', 'humor', 'cut', 'seriousness', 'issue', 'abortion', 'couples', 'seriously', 'contemplate', 'abortion', 'change', 'minds', 'love', 'big', 'difference', 'two', 'films', 'other', 'time', 'periods', 'are', 'set', 'fact', 'Bella', 'child', 'factors', 'decision', 'whereas', 'Love', 'Proper', 'Stranger', 'not', 'matter', 'fact', 'expectant', 'child', 'not', 'even', 'mentioned', 'strange', 'only', 'thing', 'McQueen', 'Wood', 'are', 'concerned', 'are', 'own', 'lives', 'Verastegui', 'Blanchard', 'are', 'concerned', 'primarily', 'child.So', 'could', 'say', 'Bella', 'pro-life', 'Love', 'Proper', 'Stranger', 'pro-abortion', 'cases', 'couples', 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'Love', 'Proper', 'Stranger', 'parents', 'child', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'films', 'are', 'interesting', 'standpoint', 'how', 'couples', 'deal', 'question', 'personally', 'culturally', 'are', 'interesting', 'standpoint', 'how', 'change', 'said', 'cases.These', 'are', 'great', 'films', 'mature', 'audiences', 'Bella', 'PG-13', 'Love', 'Proper', 'Stranger', 'unrated', 'As', 'far', 'awards', 'Love', 'Proper', 'Stranger', 'was', 'nominated', '5', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Best', 'Writing', 'Story', 'Screenplay', 'Arnold', 'Schulman', 'Being', 'independent', 'film', 'Bella', 'won', 'Heartland', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Crystal', 'Heart', 'Award', 'Grand', 'Prize', 'Dramatic', 'Feature', 'MovieGuide', 'Faith', 'Freedom', 'Award', 'Grace', 'Award', 'Eduardo', 'Verastegui', 'acting', 'Toronto', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'People', 'Choice', 'Award.Waitsel']",N/A
