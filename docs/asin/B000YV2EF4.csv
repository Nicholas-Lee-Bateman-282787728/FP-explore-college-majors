Two had their moments and were at least moderately entertaining (Transmorphers, I am Omega) while the other (Universal Soldiers) was not. Unfortunately, AvH will have to be grouped with the latter.The effects are bad, but not unreasonably bad for a low budget film. The spider effect on the alien is ill considered as it makes the creature have to hide its lower body (budget restraints)in holes, behind trees, etcetera. The Hunter looks nothing like the picture on the DVD case so caveat emptor if you are considering this based on the artwork.The acting is also bad, but is pretty standard for an Asylum feature or a Sci-Fi Original Movie. It does feature William Katt and DeeDee Pfeiffer so this may be the most ""star-studded"" Asylum production, and both 80s relics are okay in the film.The real problem with AvH as many have noted, is the plot. Events seem to happen randomly at times and there are some scratch your head turn of events as the film limps towards an improbable end. I can deal with bad effects in a movie but when the movie just doesn't make sense, it is unacceptable.

1120920,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000YV2EF4,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[7, 7]","The Greatest American Hero has fallen upon hard times indeed.  Twenty-some years after hanging up his ridiculous-looking superhero tights, William Katt is no more than a bad actor surrounded by even worse actors in this egregiously awful rip-off of Alien vs. Predator.  AVH: Alien vs. Hunter is just a stupid, stupid movie; it only took about five minutes for me to start talking back to the screen.  I don't think it's possible for anyone to maintain silence while watching this movie - not without your brains bleeding out your ears, anyway.  Such a concentrated amount of cinematic incompetence should come with a warning label.OK, here's what we have.  Two craft of some sort crash land near a remote mountain town, and - amazingly - no one seems to notice.  I guess everyone is just too busy being bored with their worthless lives - that and the fact that there only seem to be seven or eight people living there to begin with.  This place is so boring that the local sheriff all but begs the local reporter to tag along with him as he investigates a call about a domestic disturbance.  That's when someone finally notices the huge space ships sticking out of the ground (you apparently can't see gigantic, smoke-belching alien spacecraft if they're behind a small trailer home).  Before you can say, ""Well, I'll be doggoned; look at that,"" an alien (who reminds me of a wild onion turned upside down) pops up and layeth the smacketh down on the sheriff while Lee (Katt) runs back to the truck.  This is when things really begin to get frustrating.  If aliens attack my little town, the first thing I'm doing is getting in my car and getting the hell out of Dodge.  In the movie, though, no one even thinks of driving away; heck, they don't even drive to get from one location to another.  Knowing full well that aliens could be anywhere outside, these knuckleheads walk everywhere they go, even as their numbers continue to dwindle.  Here's the thing, though - the story would have us believe that there is no way to get down off the mountain in a car.  It's the middle of summer, so it's not like the place is snowed in for the winter season.  I can only assume the government had to chopper in all of the equipment to build the decent-sized town in the first place - and that government planes routinely air drop supplies to the local population.While the characters are all walking to their deaths, we get a look at two other alien creatures - one of which is a giant CGI spider.  The other one is all decked out in seemingly indestructible armor.  Still, these idiot humans keep trying to shoot and even slug him.  Moving along, the whole gang of survivors goes to great - and stupid - lengths in an attempt to escape but manage to keep getting in the way of all the aliens, blah blah blah.  Throw in a stupid ""twist"" ending and you're done.You can learn a lot from this movie.  When attacked by aliens: throw the car keys away and just start walking all over the countryside with no escape plan whatsoever; insist that everyone stay together, then go ahead and keep splitting up anyway; if the alien attacks while you are indoors, immediately run outside and hide in plain sight of the alien; if you accidentally wander into one of the alien's spaceships and no one knows where you are, stay right there in the spaceship (since there's no chance of you possibly running into an alien in the alien's own spacecraft); and most importantly, should you actually survive the whole ordeal, immediately start joking around as if it's a normal day and the body parts of all your friends and neighbors aren't littered across the countryside.So let's see: a stupid story with stupid characters doing stupid things, decidedly unimpressive special effects, exceedingly bad acting, excessive toboggan-wearing (it's summer, dude, take that ridiculous toboggan off already), an all but complete absence of character development, and a terrible ending.  Yep, that pretty much sums up AVH: Alien vs. Hunter.

1120921,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B000YV2EF4,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[3, 3]","ALIEN VS HUNTERYes that is right you read that title correctly this is indeed a knock off of AVP:R or Alien vs Predator Requiem. The Asylum is now well known for it's self described ""mockumentries"" or better said rip/knock offs, still I love this company because their original works are really good and some of the knock offs are actually good. Now I have seen many a horrible film and many of those have been cheap imitations of more successful films, many of those have been from this company but I must say this is just bad. I hate to say that because Asylum's usual producer extraordinaire David Michael Latt wrote this, usually he can make something interesting. Here though things are just unintentionally funny.The plot is actually almost the exact same as AVP:R with the ship touching down on Earth right at the beginning and some alien sometimes aliens roaming around killing people off. Of course you would not have this title without a hunter who guess what is hunting these creatures, yes it is the exact same movie just no were near as good. Honestly this movie makes the first AVP [which I didn't like as much as the second] look like Oscar worthy material on every front. I honestly can't believe that this was made like this, The Asylum is usually pretty good with these [even though my reviews of their films thus far would say differently].Writer/producer David Michael Latt really needed to rework this before he even attempted to make it. I mean the script is just awful and he even had two other films to take from, you would think they would take what worked from them and made a decent rip off. Along side Latt is director Scott Harper who really needs to stick to visual effects, his other attempt at directing while not as bad as this was still eh [that film of course would be ""Super Croc"" also from The Asylum]. I don't know if it is true but apparently he was more into playing on his new phone than working on this film, the message board for the film stated this and things were also said on the commentary about him. This guy has done visual effects on films like ""Snakes on a Plane, Dr. Dolittle, What Dreams May Come, Zathura, Ghost Ship, The Italian Job, Supernova, Liar Liar, My fellow Americans, Nutty Professor, Dead Presidents, The Indian in the Cupboard, Mortal Combat"" as well as others. I can't believe with a list like that he would make or should say just show up on set to make a film like this.I have nothing but respect for the crew and editors of this film since they were forced to try to fix this guys mess [once again if this is true]. Apparently the first AD actually became the real director for this film and got this thing done the best he could, because Scott played with his phone they didn't even film the whole thing. The editor obviously tried to fix this problem and work around it but the footage just wasn't there for him. The editor and first AD I believe are the two guys that do the commentary and it is honestly the most honest commentary ever recorded for a film. Big ups to these guys for trying so hard on something that was so lost, you can tell these two along with the crew that stepped up to try to make this really love what they do.As far as the acting it is not really there at all, but who would expect some Oscar worthy material from a movie like this. The only one who really stood out is the wonderful Dedee Pfeiffer who I have loved in many other things such as the wonderful shows ""Burn Notice & The Dead Zone"". Why she did this I will never know it could possibly be because the so called director had an excellent track record, to bad he couldn't direct like he can work with effects. William Katt is a good actor but he was here for a paycheck, can't blame him if the director wont work. The same came be said for Randy.Over all this film is funny but not because it means to be but still this film is very much worth a purchase for possibly the best commentary of all time. They not only let you know about what was going down behind the scenes but they actually talk about the short comings of the film. Still they give props to those who cared enough about the film to actually work on it. The film is a two star film at the most but only because Dedee and a Very cool looking alien [but what was up with that spider one]. But the film is worthy of 5 because of the effort put forth by the crew and post production team. So I will meet it in the middle kinda and give it three stars, oh and by the way the hunter while having an actually good ending looks nothing like the one on the DVD case.",3,1 OF THE MOST HONEST

This is definitely a very poorly done knock off of Aliens V Predator, and is so bad it is as stinky as Limburger Cheese. The only thing that makes it even a little bit palatable is the tongue-in-cheek nature of the film. Let me explain:The BAD: The script is terrible and in many places, it just doesn't make sense. It's not the type of thing you can follow and make any logical sense of. The editing is choppy and the `special effects' are probably great for the budget, but they are not great compared to other movies. The alien looks like a poor man's Geiger mixed with a spider and the Hunter looks like a poor kid's cobbled together Halloween costume (growing up poor, I know where of I speak). The acting is really, really bad. I mean BAD.The NOT SO BAD: It is really tongue in cheek, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. This quality adds an element of fun to the film and makes it watchable without being unbearable.Look, if you're looking for something less than horrible, check out AVP-R, or if you want something horrible but with better special effects watch AVP.

1120928,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000YV2EF4,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","Despite the mockbuster studio's reputation, Asylum actually can make good movies. What made I Am Omega good was that it took liberties and chances that mainstream movies wouldn't dare.  Alien vs. Hunter, on the other hand, has no interest in doing anything even remotely interesting.  It's there to confuse grandmas trying to buy their grandkids Aliens vs. Predator.  Those grandkids are not going to be happy with grandma...For those of us who love the Alien and Predator franchises, we know the basics: Predators hunt Aliens and use us as bait. AVH (I hate to even give this film even the appearance of legitimacy by giving it an abbreviation) has no interest in any of that, and instead aims for a ""man on the edge"" plot in which our supposed protagonist Lee Cussler (William Katt) is a failed journalist who wrote a scathing tell-all.  This story tainted Cussler's reputation with everyone in town, who are unlikely to believe his tales of alien hunters from outer space.  Cussler's predicament is completely irrelevant of course, because in the span of just a few minutes everyone is grouped together like contestants on a reality show.  Come to think of it, that would have made a better movie.AVH's biggest problem is that it's simply poorly produced.  The audio is terrible, the music inappropriate, and the acting is all over the place.  At various points the actors seem to have either decided to improvise, had no direction, or just forgot their lines.  The scenes are so disjointed that characters appear to be teleporting from set to set - a sewer crawl here, a fortified bunker there, some random forest...time and space are mutable in the world of Z-level movie-making. For all we know, there was no script. The plot, if one can call it that, doesn't require much.That leaves the monsters themselves.  The Alien-knockoff is similar to the xenomorph from the torso-up; the rest of it is like a giant spider, rendered in unconvincing detail through CGI.  The Predator-knockoff is a guy in a suit with a mushroom-like helmet that sports a single red lens.  If the actor in the suit were bigger, it might have been effective.  Instead the Hunter looks like he wandered off another set from the 80s, say Battle Beyond the Stars. Now that was an awesome low-budget alien movie!But I digress. Alien vs. Hunter is every bit the cynical cheap knockoff that audiences have come to expect from mockbusters. Ploddingly paced, filled with recycled footage, and populated by awful actors (Wittly Jourdan is particularly bad) whom you can barely hear over the equally awful soundtrack, AVH isn't even bad enough to mock.  It's just bad.  Jourdan sums it up best as Tammy:""We're stuck on an alien spaceship and that totally sucks!""Yes, Tammy.

1120929,A2T8L3RQCW3ESR,B000YV2EF4,"Mike Patrick, professor of media","[1, 1]","First off, let's acknowledge how nice it is to see William Katt in a movie again. He's a long damn way from ""House"" (the '80s horror-comedy, not the medical ""Sherlock Holmes"" redux), longer still from ""The Greatest American Hero"" and an eon from the surfing classic ""Big Wednesday."" And, he's got a middle school music teacher's ""Flanders"" mustache. But he's still William Katt, and seeing him here is like seeing your cool, stoner cousin at the 10-year family reunion and being pleasantly relieved to discover he's still cool and still a stoner.Let's acknowledge, secondly, that this is not AVP, and if you were fooled by the photo on the box and the spacey font, you probably need to pay more attention to a lot of things in your life more important than DVD box art.That said, acknowledge again that AVP itself isn't exactly ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Aping a comic-book action movie and succeeding as a lesser quality one is kind of like being one of those also-ran comic books that launched in the wake of ""Action Comics #1"" -- you're not ""Superman,"" by any means, but you satisfy when ""Superman"" is sold out.AVH satisfies like that. It probably cost less than a million to make, the special effects are passable, but work (though they're few and far between), and the ""hunter"" costume is actually better than you might expect.Looking for logic? Was there any logic to ""AVP: Requiem""? I couldn't figure that one out with flash cards. Here, nobody behaves in the way a normal human being would when faced with a situation like this. But if they did, there would be no movie. Or, at least, there would be a really short movie made up of nothing but people running as fast as they can, yelling, ""Aaaaah! Giant alien spiders!"" The end.Me, I'd rather watch them wander endlessly in the woods and talk incessantly about their situation; it being that a giant alien spider is for some reason running around on earth, as is its alien ""hunter"" that for reasons unclear also chooses to kill humans.I do love that whenever we're treated to the scene as through an alien's eyes, the director just puts a piece of beveled glass in front of the camera, as if any creature anywhere could survive with that kind of eyesight.It's disconcerting to see here that decades of smoking have taken their toll on '80s cutie-pie Dedee Pfeiffer, who had always been more approachably attractive than her goddess-like sister Michelle. Nowadays, the Marlboro man has softer skin than this chick. Seriously, Linda Hamilton strikes her matches off Dedee Pfeiffer's cheeks.And hey! There's a surprise ending! Does it count as a spoiler to say that it's stupid? Not really, since everything else in this film is stupid, too. Not giving anything away there.But you know, if ""American Gladiators"" taught us anything, it's that things can be stupid, but also fun. I'm glad to have picked AVH up for $2.99 at K-Mart on the same DVD as two other films produced by The Asylum -- the surprisingly effective ""I Am Legend"" mockbuster ""I Am Omega"" (which is worth the entire $2.99 itself), and the annoyingly tedious ""Cloverfield"" mockbuster ""Monster"" (which you should just leave be, unless someone is willing to pay you $2.99 to watch it).",2,"You were expecting maybe ""Star Wars""?",1332115200,"03 19, 2012",2012,3201,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'acknowledge', 'how', 'nice', 'see', 'William', 'Katt', 'movie', 'again', 'long', 'damn', 'way', 'House', ""'80s"", 'horror-comedy', 'not', 'medical', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'redux', 'longer', 'still', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'eon', 'surfing', 'classic', 'Big', 'Wednesday', 'got', 'middle', 'school', 'music', 'teacher', 'Flanders', 'mustache', 'still', 'William', 'Katt', 'seeing', 'here', 'seeing', 'cool', 'stoner', 'cousin', '10-year', 'family', 'reunion', 'being', 'pleasantly', 'relieved', 'discover', 'still', 'cool', 'still', 'stoner.Let', 'acknowledge', 'secondly', 'not', 'AVP', 'were', 'fooled', 'photo', 'box', 'spacey', 'font', 'probably', 'need', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'lot', 'things', 'life', 'more', 'important', 'DVD', 'box', 'art.That', 'said', 'acknowledge', 'again', 'AVP', ""n't"", 'exactly', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'Aping', 'comic-book', 'action', 'movie', 'succeeding', 'lesser', 'quality', 'one', 'kind', 'being', 'one', 'also-ran', 'comic', 'books', 'launched', 'wake', 'Action', 'Comics', '1', ""'re"", 'not', 'Superman', 'means', 'satisfy', 'when', 'Superman', 'sold', 'out.AVH', 'satisfies', 'probably', 'cost', 'less', 'million', 'make', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'passable', 'work', ""'re"", 'few', 'far', 'hunter', 'costume', 'actually', 'better', 'might', 'expect.Looking', 'logic', 'Was', 'logic', 'AVP', 'Requiem', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'one', 'out', 'flash', 'cards', 'Here', 'nobody', 'behaves', 'way', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'would', 'when', 'faced', 'situation', 'did', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'least', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'short', 'movie', 'made', 'nothing', 'people', 'running', 'as', 'fast', 'can', 'yelling', 'Aaaaah', 'Giant', 'alien', 'spiders', 'end.Me', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'wander', 'endlessly', 'woods', 'talk', 'incessantly', 'situation', 'being', 'giant', 'alien', 'spider', 'reason', 'running', 'around', 'earth', 'alien', 'hunter', 'reasons', 'unclear', 'also', 'kill', 'humans.I', 'do', 'love', 'whenever', ""'re"", 'treated', 'scene', 'alien', 'eyes', 'director', 'just', 'piece', 'beveled', 'glass', 'front', 'camera', 'creature', 'anywhere', 'could', 'survive', 'kind', 'eyesight.It', 'disconcerting', 'see', 'here', 'decades', 'smoking', 'have', 'taken', 'toll', ""'80s"", 'cutie-pie', 'Dedee', 'Pfeiffer', 'who', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'more', 'approachably', 'attractive', 'goddess-like', 'sister', 'Michelle', 'Nowadays', 'Marlboro', 'man', 'softer', 'skin', 'chick', 'Seriously', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'matches', 'Dedee', 'Pfeiffer', 'cheeks.And', 'hey', 'surprise', 'ending', 'count', 'spoiler', 'say', 'stupid', 'Not', 'really', 'everything', 'else', 'film', 'stupid', 'too', 'Not', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'know', 'American', 'Gladiators', 'taught', 'anything', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'stupid', 'also', 'fun', ""'m"", 'glad', 'have', 'picked', 'AVH', 'up', '2.99', 'K-Mart', 'same', 'DVD', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'produced', 'Asylum', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'Am', 'Legend', 'mockbuster', 'Am', 'Omega', 'entire', '2.99', 'annoyingly', 'tedious', 'Cloverfield', 'mockbuster', 'Monster', 'should', 'just', 'leave', 'be', 'someone', 'willing', 'pay', '2.99', 'watch']",AVH: Alien vs Hunter

This one fits in the latter category.  I went into this movie with really low expectations, and I was still disappointed.  It might be so bad that even the Sci-Fi channel won't show it.  The acting is stilted, the photography is poor - it really needed another pass of color correction, the animation is jerky, the alien costuming looks home made.

It is not. It is a poorly made, poorly acted low-budget horror movie which shamelessly steals ideas from that franchise but fails to deliver anything worth watching. The storyline is non-existent beyond the basic idea of ""aliens crash-land on Earth and mindless slaughter ensues""; the acting is abysmal; the special effects absolutely risible (with even the ""men-in-rubber-suits"" nature of the alien hunter being used as a final throw-away laugh in the film's closing reveal!)Even the horror isn't well done and the only frightening thing about this release is the thought that someone might actually pay any money to watch it!

Had I looked more closely, I would have seen that this movie has nothing to do with those, but does sport a cover and logo that blatantly rips off the Alien vs. Predator films - almost to the point of [...].Having been fooled, I found myself treated to one of the worst ""aliens"" movies I've suffered through in quite some time. Bad acting, inane dialogue, poor character development (with some characters dressed like it's summer and others like it's winter), cheesy effects, and an ending that makes no sense whatsoever. There are two aliens here, and I presume one is here to capture the other, but the two either never engage each other or did so during that period near the end when I caught myself dozing off. Attempts by the humans to engage the alien in the metal suit were embarrassing, and when one of the former grabbed the latter from behind around the waist I wanted to throw something at my DVD player.This movie is a waste of time, and Asylum Entertainment deserves at least a good dressing down for ripping off the cover (and logo) of the ""Alien vs. Predator"" films.",1,AVH: Alien Vs.
