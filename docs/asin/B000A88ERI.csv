923597,A9KAY47NCPQS,B000A88ERI,"Beatrice Izzey ""Nanny Dog""","[0, 0]","My Francophile American friend who is very, very well read told me this is one of his favorite movies ever.  He asked me to evaluate Sophie Tessud&#8217;s Japanese speaking ability.  I read, write, and speak Japanese, so though I was put off by the photo of the white face and red lipstick of a geisha on the DVD cover, I gave it a try.I was blown away by how accurately this movie captures how Japanese people &#8211; and people in any competitive urban office setting anywhere in the world &#8211; really are.  We all know about how many Westerners go on and on yadda yadda about the politeness, the demureness, the respectfulness, the reserve and the elegance of Japanese people.The absolute truth is that they are a mean, vicious, racist, sexist people.  They are just like the Brits particularly the Londoners, the New Yorkers, the Shanghainese, the Parisians, the Romans, you name it.  If you have lived and worked for a length of time in any these places, you know just how petty, uncurious, and insular the &#8220;elite&#8221; people can be towards outsiders.This movie captures in particularly wincing detail the meanness and competitiveness of women towards other women.  Who is married, who gave up heterosexist norms to climb the corporate ladder, who is a loser, who is a winner in a supposed meritocracy.  To be &#8220;grown up&#8221; is about hiding one&#8217;s true feelings at all costs, putting others down both subtly and openly, and hen pecking constantly.  Of course, the ugliness of feminine competition is not limited to Japanese women.Here, we are privy to the truth of Japanese female competitiveness because the Japanese-speaking main character lets us actually hear, understand, and suffer at every mincing denigrating word that is said to her.  Without the main character&#8217;s sensitive and accurate comprehension of, and emotional response to the hostile and critical words, all we would see are the visually pretty Japanese faces, just as most tourists would see.The movie also accurately portrays Japanese corporate elites&#8217; cultural and racial superiority complex and ruthlessness.  The winners here make it clear that they have no need to hear what a pretty young white European girl has to say. They don&#8217;t want to know her or be known by her.  Corporate Japan is a continuation of feudalistic society. Not only is she a superfluous outsider, eventually, her superiors place her at the lowest feudal rank, as the untouchable, of the toilet cleaner caste.Back to the original question of Sophie Tessud&#8217;s Japanese speaking ability: Her Japanese is grammatically super-precise, idiomatically correct, and rich and sophisticated in vocabulary.  The perfection of the grammar and diction is in striking contrast to the rather heavy French accent.If I were to meet a person in real life who speaks like this, I would assume she is a literature or history scholar who mastered the language as an adult.  This is to say Tessud does not sound at all like someone who lived in Japan until age 5.  People who grew up there in the early years and then left tend to have a good speaking accent, but lack the vocabulary or practice to speak substantively on any serious subject.  For example, they will not have mastery of honorifics or gender-specific grammar.  A foreigner who speaks gender, age and rank-neutral Japanese gives him or herself away as an outsider.  They can say pleasantries but cannot understand basic goings-on in television news or read newspaper headlines.As for comparisons between this movie and Lost in Translation, another movie about white people in Japan: this movie is thousands of times more intellectually curious, critical, and nuanced.  This movie is about how Japanese people really are, and how a young European woman who for her own personal reasons wants to be part of that society is rejected.  The characters in Lost in Translation are a total contrast.  They are not invested in Japan for the long term, and are only interested in themselves, and are rather shallow and unprobing about the Japanese.  They are not even trying to learn a few Japanese phrases.  Coppola&#8217;s story could have been located in any country and at best it is an accurate depiction of how privileged white Americans act overseas.Though I had never heard of Amelie Nothomb, the author, this movie made me want to read the book.  She must be of a rare mind.  I rarely feel this way about movie adaptations.",5,Dead-on portrayal of meanness of Japanese corporate people,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,4462,"['Francophile', 'American', 'friend', 'who', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'read', 'told', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'ever', 'asked', 'evaluate', 'Sophie', 'Tessud', '8217', 's', 'Japanese', 'speaking', 'ability', 'read', 'write', 'speak', 'Japanese', 'was', 'put', 'off', 'photo', 'white', 'face', 'red', 'lipstick', 'geisha', 'DVD', 'cover', 'gave', 'try.I', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'how', 'accurately', 'movie', 'how', 'Japanese', 'people', '8211', 'people', 'competitive', 'urban', 'office', 'setting', 'anywhere', 'world', '8211', 'really', 'are', 'know', 'how', 'many', 'Westerners', 'go', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'politeness', 'demureness', 'respectfulness', 'reserve', 'elegance', 'Japanese', 'people.The', 'absolute', 'truth', 'are', 'mean', 'vicious', 'racist', 'sexist', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'Brits', 'particularly', 'Londoners', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'Shanghainese', 'Parisians', 'Romans', 'name', 'have', 'lived', 'worked', 'length', 'time', 'places', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'petty', 'uncurious', 'insular', '8220', '8221', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'towards', 'outsiders.This', 'movie', 'captures', 'particularly', 'wincing', 'detail', 'meanness', 'competitiveness', 'women', 'other', 'women', 'Who', 'married', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'heterosexist', 'norms', 'climb', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'who', 'loser', 'who', 'winner', 'supposed', 'meritocracy', 'be', '8220', 'grown', 'up', '8221', 'hiding', 'one', '8217', 'true', 'feelings', 'costs', 'putting', 'others', 'down', 'subtly', 'openly', 'hen', 'pecking', 'constantly', 'course', 'ugliness', 'feminine', 'competition', 'not', 'limited', 'Japanese', 'women.Here', 'are', 'privy', 'truth', 'Japanese', 'female', 'competitiveness', 'Japanese-speaking', 'main', 'character', 'actually', 'hear', 'understand', 'suffer', 'mincing', 'denigrating', 'word', 'said', 'main', 'character', '8217', 'sensitive', 'accurate', 'comprehension', 'emotional', 'response', 'hostile', 'critical', 'words', 'would', 'see', 'are', 'visually', 'pretty', 'Japanese', 'just', 'most', 'tourists', 'would', 'see.The', 'movie', 'also', 'accurately', 'Japanese', 'corporate', 'elites', '8217', 'cultural', 'racial', 'superiority', 'complex', 'ruthlessness', 'winners', 'here', 'make', 'clear', 'have', 'need', 'hear', 'what', 'pretty', 'young', 'white', 'European', 'girl', 'say', 'don', '8217', 'want', 'know', 'be', 'known', 'Corporate', 'Japan', 'continuation', 'feudalistic', 'society', 'Not', 'only', 'superfluous', 'outsider', 'eventually', 'superiors', 'place', 'lowest', 'feudal', 'rank', 'untouchable', 'toilet', 'cleaner', 'caste.Back', 'original', 'question', 'Sophie', 'Tessud', '8217', 's', 'Japanese', 'speaking', 'ability', 'Japanese', 'grammatically', 'super-precise', 'idiomatically', 'correct', 'rich', 'sophisticated', 'vocabulary', 'perfection', 'grammar', 'diction', 'striking', 'contrast', 'rather', 'heavy', 'French', 'accent.If', 'were', 'meet', 'person', 'real', 'life', 'who', 'would', 'assume', 'literature', 'history', 'scholar', 'who', 'mastered', 'language', 'adult', 'say', 'Tessud', 'not', 'sound', 'someone', 'who', 'lived', 'Japan', 'age', '5', 'People', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'there', 'early', 'years', 'then', 'left', 'tend', 'have', 'good', 'speaking', 'accent', 'lack', 'vocabulary', 'practice', 'speak', 'substantively', 'serious', 'subject', 'example', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'mastery', 'honorifics', 'gender-specific', 'grammar', 'foreigner', 'who', 'gender', 'age', 'rank-neutral', 'Japanese', 'away', 'outsider', 'can', 'say', 'pleasantries', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'basic', 'goings-on', 'television', 'news', 'read', 'newspaper', 'headlines.As', 'comparisons', 'movie', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'movie', 'white', 'people', 'Japan', 'movie', 'thousands', 'times', 'more', 'intellectually', 'curious', 'critical', 'nuanced', 'movie', 'how', 'Japanese', 'people', 'really', 'are', 'how', 'young', 'European', 'woman', 'who', 'own', 'personal', 'reasons', 'be', 'part', 'society', 'rejected', 'characters', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'are', 'total', 'contrast', 'are', 'not', 'invested', 'Japan', 'long', 'term', 'are', 'only', 'interested', 'are', 'rather', 'shallow', 'unprobing', 'Japanese', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'trying', 'learn', 'few', 'Japanese', 'phrases', 'Coppola', '8217', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'located', 'country', 'best', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'how', 'privileged', 'white', 'Americans', 'act', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Amelie', 'Nothomb', 'author', 'movie', 'made', 'want', 'read', 'book', 'must', 'be', 'rare', 'mind', 'rarely', 'feel', 'way', 'movie', 'adaptations']",Fear and Trembling
923598,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B000A88ERI,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[15, 16]","Alan Corneau's film adaptation of Amelie Nothomb's autographical novel ""Fear and Trembling"" borders on a near perfect portrayal of a young Belgian ing&eacute;nue's desire to be understood and accepted amidst a backdrop of cultural differences as glimpsed from under the bell jar of the Japanese corporation. Corneau does author Nothomb's story one better, casting redheaded elf Sylvie Testud in the lead role.  While her wistful facial expressions easily maneuver the audience to see matters from the Western perspective from the get-go, Testud manages to achieve a Chaplin-esque timing that charms as well as amuses as she ponders her bad karma in the corporate world with an almost Zen-like complacency.Hired as an interpreter, Amelie struggles to maintain some degree of necessity in an environment that is clearly working overtime to make her feel worthless.  As her tale of self-awareness progresses, she finds herself demoted to bathroom attendant, completely humiliated by the likes of her superior, the tall, beautiful and statuesque Fubuki Mori (played wonderfully by actress/model Kaori Tsuji) who Amelie openly admires with a fierce allegiance that pathetically fringes on fanatic adoration.Similar in theme to Sophia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation,""  ""Fear and Trembling"" does a much better job of entertaining while delivering the Western head-scratching message regarding the Japanese philosophical fixation on obedience and loyalty to the hierarchical social entity as opposed to individual enterprise.  As the film moves towards its eventual conclusion, it never once becomes muddled or caught in the quagmire of its own cleverness.  Instead, Corneau pits Tsuji and Testud against each other with an unspoken sexual tension that beguiles with masochistic undertones.  That the two characters are attracted to each other in some perverse way adds to the utter emptiness of their lives at the Yumimoto conglomerate where the glass ceiling hangs overhead like a phantom sword of Damocles.Bottom line?  As Amelie quakes with appropriate ""fear and trembling""---the title of this film refers to behavior expected from anyone in the presence of the emperor---she still swells within with her Western pride yet basks in her ability to be as humble as a native born Japanese.  This journey of self-discovery and cultural differences sparkles with a superior comedy thanks to Testud's Cesar winning performance and Corneau's slightly mindgame erotic adapation of Nothomb's novel.

Fear and Trembling gives us an insight as to what it must be like to live Japanese, while Lost in Translation was a relationship story between 2 westerners that could have been filmed anywhere and it happened to be in Japan.Many westerners and asians alike find Japanese culture difficult to comprehend - this movie manages to portray how a foreigner, starting off a peon, can easily descend into lunacy while trying to understand Japanese culture and in attempting to fit in.  At the heart of all the bizarre and inexplicable situations the main character Amelie experiences, is the art of giving and saving face and her inability to understand this piles on humiliation after humiliation.The character Amelie highlights the paradox that is Japan - so admired by outsiders but I doubt that outsiders can endure a life that is the real Japan.

It is about the universal issues we all face.  Amelie was born in Japan and lived there until age 5, when her parents return to their homeland of Belgium.As a young, recently graduated adult, she seeks to return to the land that seemed so serene she so admired in her early formative years.  Unfortunately, things change and this movie incorporates multiple themes: 1) learning how the adult world operates; 2) being the lowest person on the food chain; 3) having to learn corporate culture and Japanese culture with little guidance (one man does try to help her but her reputation has already been sullied beyond repair); 4) her refusal to acknowledge her desperate situation because of her own naivete; 5) her courageous stand not to allow her circumstances define her.I found the acting superb.

The creativity to take such a great struggle and find comedic relief throughout makes this a 5 star movie!So, if you have ever:1) been challenged by a new job in a new field of work;2) had a boss that hates you and seeks to embarrass and humiliate you at any cost;3) had coworkers that lacked empathy and shared your bosses' willingness to humiliateyou by joining in bullying;4) had to find the courage to stand against such humiliations to demonstrating that youwill not be broken;then, you will become Amelie as she faces her adversaries!Well done to the author for having insight into the good and bad of humanity and expressing it so adeptly, the film writer for portraying this story with such finesse, and the actors for their outstanding performances.",5,You Can't Go Back Home,1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,1836,"['advertising', 'disc', 'state', 'akin', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'found', 'comparison', 'only', 'be', 'minor', 'when', 'viewing', 'film.This', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'cultural', 'differences', 'universal', 'issues', 'face', 'Amelie', 'was', 'born', 'Japan', 'lived', 'there', 'age', '5', 'when', 'parents', 'return', 'homeland', 'Belgium.As', 'young', 'recently', 'graduated', 'adult', 'return', 'land', 'seemed', 'so', 'serene', 'so', 'admired', 'early', 'formative', 'years', 'Unfortunately', 'things', 'change', 'movie', 'multiple', 'themes', '1', 'learning', 'how', 'adult', 'world', '2', 'being', 'lowest', 'person', 'food', 'chain', '3', 'having', 'learn', 'corporate', 'culture', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'little', 'guidance', 'one', 'man', 'try', 'help', 'reputation', 'already', 'been', 'sullied', 'repair', '4', 'refusal', 'acknowledge', 'desperate', 'situation', 'own', 'naivete', '5', 'courageous', 'stand', 'not', 'allow', 'circumstances', 'define', 'her.I', 'found', 'acting', 'superb', 'characters', 'are', 'sharply', 'drawn', 'distraction', 'great', 'embellishment', 'creativity', 'take', 'such', 'great', 'struggle', 'find', 'comedic', 'relief', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'So', 'have', 'ever:1', 'been', 'challenged', 'new', 'job', 'new', 'field', 'work', '2', 'had', 'boss', 'seeks', 'embarrass', 'humiliate', 'cost', '3', 'had', 'coworkers', 'lacked', 'empathy', 'shared', 'bosses', 'willingness', 'humiliateyou', 'joining', 'bullying', '4', 'had', 'find', 'courage', 'stand', 'such', 'humiliations', 'demonstrating', 'youwill', 'not', 'be', 'broken', 'then', 'will', 'become', 'Amelie', 'adversaries', 'Well', 'done', 'author', 'having', 'insight', 'good', 'bad', 'humanity', 'expressing', 'so', 'adeptly', 'film', 'writer', 'portraying', 'story', 'such', 'finesse', 'actors', 'outstanding', 'performances']",Fear and Trembling

If you want to understand Japanese culture from a westerner point of view, you will be 75% satisfied. (More on this later.) If you are looking for an ""art film"", this one may fail you. That is why I gave it 4-stars rating.From a layman viewer point of view, one may find this film funny but a bit pretentious. From a art-film buff point of view, one may find this too naive. I have to say this film is not very successful to appeal to either world.However, if you really have the time and mind-set to understand Japanese culture (not just those mentioned in a tourist guide book), this is pretty good point to start. The film used an exaggerated manner to examplified the deeper cultural structure of Japan. The film starts with the central character (a Japan born Belgian girl) introducing her position in a big Japanese company through a company chart-way: A is B's supervisor and B is C's supervisor and finally X is her supervior. And the film ends (not the actual ending but end of her career in that company) with she telling each of these supervisors, from her immediate supervisor to the managing director, her leaving and thier different reaction to it. If you use this structure as a guide to view this film. You may find this film worth more than what it looks like initially.Good viewing and enjoy it.

The film is an amazing rendition of the novel that remains true.  The movie runs a little under two hours and the editing from the original story are fine.It is a story of a young Belgium woman (Amelie) who yearns to go back to the spiritual peace that she experienced as a small child growing up in Japan. She learns how to speak and write impeccable Japanese.  She wants to become Japanese, in manner of speaking.  Amelie manages to score a one year contract with a top Japanse corporation and thinks she is well on her way to obtaining her objective of becoming one with the the Japanese culture.  Being western, this is impossible of course, and her naive foray into blending is considered an insult not a compliment by her employers.Despite all of her knowledge and attempts to become one with her environment, it is not allowed by the Japense corporation (or society).  We see some sections that applaud her efforts and realize that the old ways of doing things need to be changed and do their best to help her (or any western influence) but they are doomed to fail.  These two cultures are diametrically opposed and will never mesh, the film seems to say.At the end Amelie has come to realize that she is by nature, a westerner despite her desire to be ""Japanese.""  The best she can do is serve out her one year contract to save face, a Japanese principle.More importantly, I thought it was about self-actualization and learning to achieve peace from within instead of looking for external sources.",5,YOU CAN NEVER GO BACK....or can you?,1218067200,"08 7, 2008",2008,1597,"['Usually', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'see', 'movie', 'end', 'up', 'disappointed', 'Not', 'case', 'film', 'amazing', 'rendition', 'novel', 'true', 'movie', 'little', 'two', 'hours', 'editing', 'original', 'story', 'are', 'fine.It', 'story', 'young', 'Belgium', 'woman', 'Amelie', 'who', 'go', 'back', 'spiritual', 'peace', 'experienced', 'small', 'child', 'growing', 'up', 'Japan', 'how', 'speak', 'write', 'impeccable', 'Japanese', 'become', 'Japanese', 'manner', 'speaking', 'Amelie', 'score', 'one', 'year', 'contract', 'top', 'Japanse', 'corporation', 'well', 'way', 'obtaining', 'objective', 'becoming', 'one', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'Being', 'western', 'impossible', 'course', 'naive', 'foray', 'blending', 'considered', 'insult', 'not', 'compliment', 'employers.Despite', 'knowledge', 'attempts', 'become', 'one', 'environment', 'not', 'allowed', 'Japense', 'corporation', 'society', 'see', 'sections', 'applaud', 'efforts', 'realize', 'old', 'ways', 'doing', 'things', 'need', 'be', 'changed', 'do', 'best', 'help', 'western', 'influence', 'are', 'doomed', 'fail', 'two', 'cultures', 'are', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'will', 'never', 'mesh', 'film', 'say.At', 'end', 'Amelie', 'come', 'realize', 'nature', 'westerner', 'desire', 'be', 'Japanese', 'best', 'can', 'do', 'serve', 'one', 'year', 'contract', 'save', 'face', 'Japanese', 'principle.More', 'importantly', 'thought', 'was', 'self-actualization', 'learning', 'achieve', 'peace', 'instead', 'looking', 'external', 'sources']",Fear and Trembling

For that reason, I wanted to see this movie and experience how it is (or was) for others in similar situation.  Here is the story of a young Belgian woman, college graduate, fluent in Japanese and nostalgic about childhood past and romanticized experiences from living in Japan.  She is about to recapture the time lost in between and reclaim her belonging in Japanese society.  The eagerness to please does her no good but rather puts her in more trouble every time to the point that she is demoted to a bathroom attendant.  One must show the utmost respect for the actress Sylvie Testud who managed to learn Japanese language for this role. The story of young woman's will and determination in keeping the demeaning job for the entire duration of her contract in spite of humiliations she experiences is both funny and heartbreaking.  Human nature, cultural differences and misplaced loyalties all overlap in this powerful story.

Normally i go for the more historical or military flick.  But there is actually a lot of history here although most viewers probably don't realize it.This film can be seen on several different levels.  The dreadful office life that our poor Belgium heroline endures can be seen as a universal element of work today.  It can also be viewed as an indication of present day Japanese society.  We often forget that Japan was never forced to own up to its many attrocities that were committed during WW2.  For this reason Japan is still universally hated throughout Asia today.  Unlike Germany which had its nose rubbed constantly in the dirt for its many war crimes, Japan never had to endure this purification process.  American occupation was lenient and easy going for the most part.  Japan was built back up to be a key part in the Cold War puzzle that was developing in the Far East after the war.  This resulted in a curious mix of attitudes that persists to this day in Japan.  The absolute respect for authority which goes back to the Middle Ages toward the emperor was translated into the militarists that ran the country during the war, and continues today with the businessmen and industrialists in Japan.  The work place attitudes toward our Belgium protaganist reflect this cruel and savage outlook.  This is a nation that never acknowlegded the many war crimes that it committed over 60 years ago.  To this day Japanese children are hardly educated about the frightful history of their country during the 1935 - 1945 period.  The result is a nation in complete denial of its past.  This is not surprising considering Japan was forced to modernize so quickly in order to catch up with the West.  The cruel and humilating attidues seen here in the work place are a reflection of Japanese society today.  A society that never had to own up to its many war crimes, and which still feels superior toward others.The fear and trembling one must show toward the boss today is a direct connection with Japan's past.  Whether its the absolute authority expressed toward the Samurai War Lord, the Emperor or the head of Mitsubishi corporation (The same company who manufactured the famous zero fighter plane in WW2)the result is the same.  We should be weary of Japan's place in the world today, and constantly remind her of the follies of her past.  This film is a frightening example of what many aspects of Japan's society is today.  Is there much difference between the Japan of December 7th 1941 and today?
