Just viewed this film again and realized why this was titled The Only Thrill. There is a scene with the lead actors when she whispers something to him that refers to the title. While it's obvious to the viewer that these two eccentrics are soul mates, it takes them most of the film to come to the same conclusion. A secondary plot involves her daughter, played by Diane Lane, and his son, whose own relationship begins to mirror that of their parents.This slow moving, but satisfying film, with all the missed opportunities between the couple, can be frustrating to watch at times, but the performances of Diane Keaton and Sam Shepherd make it worth seeing more than once. They also made a great pair in the film Baby Boom.",4,WIll They or Won't They?,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,894,"['title', 'Only', 'Thrill', ""n't"", 'fit', 'film', 'decades-long', 'bittersweet', 'relationship', 'characters', 'played', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Sam', 'Shepherd', 'Just', 'viewed', 'film', 'again', 'realized', 'why', 'was', 'titled', 'Only', 'Thrill', 'scene', 'lead', 'actors', 'when', 'something', 'refers', 'title', 'obvious', 'viewer', 'two', 'eccentrics', 'are', 'soul', 'mates', 'most', 'film', 'come', 'same', 'conclusion', 'secondary', 'plot', 'daughter', 'played', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'son', 'own', 'relationship', 'mirror', 'parents.This', 'slow', 'moving', 'satisfying', 'film', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'couple', 'can', 'be', 'frustrating', 'watch', 'times', 'performances', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Sam', 'Shepherd', 'make', 'worth', 'seeing', 'more', 'once', 'also', 'made', 'great', 'pair', 'film', 'Baby', 'Boom']",N/A

191940,A328S9RN3U5M68,1574926497,Grady Harp,"[21, 21]","Peter Masterson directs another tender film in the manner of his 'The Trip To Bountiful'. Based on the play by Larry Ketron (who also wrote the screenplay) THE ONLY THRILL follows the lives of four people over a period of 30 years, a time frame that wisely incorporates all the changes that happened between the 1960s and into 1996.  Not only is this a strong story about relationship possibilities, it is a chronicle of the changing mores from the decade of 'Love' to the decade of dissolution: social changes here documented make a lasting impression on those of us who have lived that time frame.Reece McHenry (Sam Shepard) owns a Used Clothing store in Austin, Texas and employs Carol Fitzsimmons (Diane Keaton) as his seamstress.  Reece's wife has been in a vegetative state for years and Reece has had brief encounters with other women who understand his sorrowful commitment to his physically unavailable wife.  Slowly Reece and Carol find companionship and develop an affair that remains on one level: Reece is afraid to fall in love and Carol is afraid to ask for more from the relationship than she is getting.  Reece's son Tom (Robert Patrick) is a loner, unwilling to be in a relationship with a single woman and Carol's daughter Katherine (Diane Lane) is a free spirit who longs to be an actress and needs to feel free to have her own life to herself.  As Reece and Carol develop their mutual needs so do Tom and Katherine, and if ever there were examples of 'like father/mother, like son/daughter' they are here.At the point where both potential relationships could become solid, fate intervenes: Carol's sister is ill in Canada and Carol must move there (wanting  Reece to move with her), and Katherine gets a call from a little theater in Tennessee for an acting part and she elects to leave Austin and Tom to pursue her own life.Thirty years pass and though both couples have chances to reconnect, they don't. Finally Katherine and Carol return to Austin and Reece and Tom find Carol has the same illness from which her sister died.  Reece's distress over the fact that he has allowed thirty years of irretrievable life to escape him only to have his true love for Carol surface too late makes him plead with Tom to not follow in his mistakes.  The closing of the film is a touching but not mawkish paean to the importance of commitment to meaningful relationships and how that is handled is a moment not to be missed or prejudiced by a spoiler.The writing is exceptional, as is the direction.  Though the above summary may sound like a maudlin soap opera it is anything but that.  Laced with humor, philosophy, a variety of genuinely touching character actors (Tate Donavan, Sharon Lawrence, and especially Brad Leland), this story captures the flavor of a small town in transition.  There are many moments of true comedy laced with tragedy that mark the works of fine writers for the theater.Diane Keaton, Sam Shepard, Diane Lane and Robert Patrick are all excellent in their pivotal roles. It is a pleasure to see such gifted actors strut their stuff!  A warm, meaningful movie.

This movie balances romance and drama well. The point of this movie is to tell your significant other only three words: &quot;i love you&quot;, but to the two couples in this movie, it's taking them a lifetime to say it. I thought the plot was sweet,also the actors, but you find yourself thinking &quot;come on! just hurry up and say 'i love you!'&quot;.. though i like this movie, i have a few thoughts based on the plot. The plot seems too general- like every part seems superficial. I wanted to see the actors show a bit of emotion. Instead, they're holding in their feelings for each other. the story should have been focused on the older couple, Keaton and Shepard. Patrick's friend, Donovan, just seems out of place- it makes the movie seem awkward sometimes. Of course, I'm tossing out random thoughts on the movie, but I just think that the script should have called for deep analysis of each couple's feelings, as well as how the decades influenced them. Basically, there was no emotion. Impassivity, that's it. Sure, there were anger and all, but I wanted to see tears and sweet nothings whispered in ears. I wanted to see vulnerability. The plot is so intent on concealing the actors' true feelings that it just drowns out the tender feelings shared between them. I know even if it was difficult for them to express their feelings, they could have expressed their feelings in a different way.  I overall like this movie, but it doesn't rate as one of my favorites. I enjoyed seeing Keaton in this movie, though. She's one of my favorite actresses.",3,good for a rainy night,982886400,"02 23, 2001",2001,1675,"['movie', 'good', 'rainy', 'night', 'when', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'bored', 'not', 'mood', 'overly-drenched', 'romance', 'movie', 'romance', 'drama', 'well', 'point', 'movie', 'tell', 'significant', 'other', 'only', 'three', 'words', 'quot', 'love', 'quot', 'two', 'couples', 'movie', 'taking', 'lifetime', 'say', 'thought', 'plot', 'was', 'sweet', 'also', 'actors', 'find', 'thinking', 'quot', 'come', 'just', 'hurry', 'up', 'say', 'i', 'love', 'quot', '..', 'i', 'movie', 'i', 'have', 'few', 'thoughts', 'based', 'plot', 'plot', 'too', 'general-', 'part', 'superficial', 'wanted', 'see', 'actors', 'show', 'bit', 'emotion', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'holding', 'feelings', 'other', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'focused', 'older', 'couple', 'Keaton', 'Shepard', 'Patrick', 'friend', 'Donovan', 'just', 'place-', 'movie', 'seem', 'awkward', 'sometimes', 'course', ""'m"", 'tossing', 'out', 'random', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'just', 'think', 'script', 'should', 'have', 'called', 'deep', 'analysis', 'couple', 'feelings', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'decades', 'influenced', 'Basically', 'was', 'emotion', 'Impassivity', 'Sure', 'were', 'anger', 'wanted', 'see', 'tears', 'sweet', 'nothings', 'whispered', 'ears', 'wanted', 'see', 'vulnerability', 'plot', 'so', 'intent', 'concealing', 'actors', 'true', 'feelings', 'just', 'out', 'tender', 'feelings', 'shared', 'know', 'even', 'was', 'difficult', 'express', 'feelings', 'could', 'have', 'expressed', 'feelings', 'different', 'way', 'overall', 'movie', ""n't"", 'rate', 'one', 'favorites', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Keaton', 'movie', 'though', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses']",N/A
191942,A3Q7ZXHEZBE4IJ,1574926497,"Judith Johnson ""JJ""","[5, 5]","This Hallmark type romance has an excellent cast, great scenery and set design but still fails to sweep the viewer up in my opinion.  This is due to the script which violates Aristotle's first rule of good screen play, tell the story in the shortest time frame possible.  Secondly, you have to make the audience engage with the characters in the first few minutes, after that you lose their sympathy (and interest).This story concerns two romances affecting two generations over a 30-year period.  The first romance depicted is between the protagonists portrayed by Diane Keaton and Sam Shepard.  This relationship is tainted by Shepard's character's adultery as he is married to a woman who has an undisclosed condition that keeps her confined to a hospital bed (and presumably unable to have marital relations).  So his character is a serial philander who first bonks his best friend's wife (Keaton) before she is widowed.  Sadly, Keaton's inherent kookiness is not necessarily a good thing for her character.As the story drags on, the main characters never display any character arc by making commitments to themselves or anyone else. To complicate matters, Shepard's teenage son falls for Keaton's daughter but, taking a cue from their parents, they never seem to get it together either.  Some might see it as romantic but the story is not resolved very satisfactorily in my opinion although it is probably very close to what happens in real lives.
