Now, if these remakes were any good, I would have no objection (King Kong, Dawn of the Dead, etc.), but most of them take the original premise, about 50 million more dollars in budget, and proceed to tear to pieces the classic films that you thought couldn't be tainted.House of Wax isn't awful.  In fact, on its own, it isn't really that bad of a horror movie.  The gore is OK, the kills are somewhat creative, and it actually takes the time to set up its main characters.  The killing doesn't even start until about 50 minutes into the film, and for that, it has my respect, at least.  What kills this movie is the fact that, since it is a remake, it is constantly compared to the original, as it should be.  The original House of Wax was a great horror film.  By today's standards, everyone would hate it, so what the remake does is try to turn a classic horror film into entertainment for today's shallow, unappreciative filmgoers.  And, of course, it has to add that last ""gotcha!"" at the end to make us all watch the credits with our jaws on the floor (sarcasm).It seems this review has been rather seething and hate-filled so far, yet I gave the film 3 stars.  Like I said before, if it wasn't a remake of one of the best horror films ever, I think I could have been much more appreciative of what it does do.

927933,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000AM4P9K,A. Estes,"[65, 85]","This new version of ""House Of Wax"" bears very little resemblance to the original, released over fifty years ago. That right there means certain people are gonna be angry about it. And I'm sure it must pain fans of the original to see this updated version with Paris Hilton as one of the stars. Nevertheless, if you are just looking for a good, fun slasher, with a hard R-rating (believe me, this puppy earned it), you could do much worse. Forget that this is a remake, and you will probably find yourself being pleasantly surprised. And if you still aren't sold, look at it this way: You get to watch Paris Hilton die!""House Of Wax,"" which stars Chad Michael Murray (from WB's...well, just the WB I guess) and Elisha Cuthbert (who is way sexier than Hilton, without even trying) tells the familiar story of a group of twenty somethings, on their way to a football game, who pull over for the night to set up camp and get a little R & R. However, an automobile problem, a broken headlight, and some damn stinky squirrels and deer, cause this group to wander into a town that time seems to have forgotten. The town, however, has one interesting feature, and that is the infamous House Of Wax. Not only is everything inside made out of wax (or is it?), the House itself is Of Wax. Of course, things go horribly wrong. Why does it feel like the wax figures can see us? Who was that outside the window? Why does that guy keep flirting and leering at my girlfriend? The movie plays out much like classic slashers such as ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" and even more like the 2003 ""T.C.M."" remake. Not only are both remakes extremely pumped up from the original, but you will notice many parellels between the two, from the bizarre torture scenes, to the creepy towns people, all the bases are covered with this movie. If you are a genre fan, you can't help but enjoy this movie. It does try a few different things and will take you by surprise a few times. Heck, one major surprise is Paris Hilton playing someone with moderate intellect. When someone says ""What's that smell?"" she doesn't want to find out. When she is being chased by the antagonist, she finds a weapon, and uses it. Not just your average teen slasher/splatter flick. As far as the gore goes, this movie has an abundance of it, but I found the wax much more effective. On a list of worst ways to die, I'd put that at the top! And when will people realize, if you keep picking at it, it won't heal (watch it and find out)? If it's possible to have a fear of wax, this movie may put it in you.So try not to let the seemingly shallow nature of this movie turn you away. Afterall, it's actually quite good, and it's refreshing, in a world of nuetered ""PG-13"" ""horror"" flicks, that a nice, solid ""R"" comes along and gives us the flanking we so badly needed. It's got it's flaws, and it does take a while for the film to build momentum, but if you want thrills, this one's got it.

But it wasn't - it was actually pretty good. I've seen a lot -  and I do mean A LOT - of trashy horror films, but ""House Of Wax"" was a real pleasant surprise. First of all, Paris Hilton acts just as well as any of the other members of the cast. Now I realise there are no Shakesperean legends appearing in this film to rank her alongside, but give the girl a break. Anyway, the performances are all pretty good. The story is reasonably interesting, but of course it's predictable. Although I don't think this version of the story uses much, if any, of the script of any previous releases, instead it provides it's own plot in which teenage holidaymakers stumble upon a small town with a deserted wax museum. There's definitely something wrong here, and although you know exactly what those wax statues are going to turn out to be, the secrets of who made them and why are only gradually revealed, and it's quite a fun experience to watch.But the action, effects and the look of the film are the real stars here. The actual wax museum itself is brilliant. I've never seen such a sinister wax museum before in a movie. The exterior is a bit drab but the layout of the exhibition has the statues placed in sets designed to look like real rooms in a house, and the figures all appear to be dancing, chatting, eating dinner or otherwise doing everyday stuff. There isn't enough screen time given over to these statues in my opinion, because they are the creepiest looking things I have ever seen. And as the actors sneak into the derelict museum and start snooping around the various tableaux, I reckon they didn't have to act very hard at being freaked out when confronted with these things.The other plus about the movie is that it doesn't hold back on the blood and gore. The attacks and murders are all full on splatter moments, especailly some of the scenes where live victims are turned into wax statues (oh come on, you knew that much, didn't you?) Plus one great wince-inducing moment when a character tries to peel the layer of wax off the face of one of the living statues...ouch! And there are many other instances of very painful looking moments that should get most viewers clenching their teeth...good stuff!The film builds pretty well throughout it's running time with some great cliff hanging scenes, and it culminates in a spectacular fiery climax, which you have to see for yourself...preferably on a large screen. I was on the edge of my seat as the final survivors tried to escape the deadly inferno, and left the cinema feeling highly entertained.

On the surface this movie bares little resemblence to the Price film from 1953. However, there are many scenes that recall the original film. The fact that one of the guys at the House Of Wax is named Vincent is no coincidence. The basic plot of this film is a group of twenty-something's get sidetracked in the back woods of Louisana. There they stumble upon this creepy town with a funeral going on. That's when everything starts to go wrong. Paris Hilton is actually a lot better than you might expect her to be. Her big scene was done pretty well. As I said this isn't a straight remake of the Price film. One thing many younger viewers may be interested to know is that the way the wax figures are made in the new film is the exact same way they are made in the original, and keep in mind that film came out in the 1950's!!!!! The scenes of the wax melting also looks a lot the scenes from the original, in a sense even the ending is the same. This one has more blood and scenes where you'll either cringe or jump, or both!

I mean that by the end of the movie, you couldn't care less who died or got maimed, and would actually believe they are either deserving, or simply too stupid to live.  To make a ""Saw"" reference, if Jigsaw caught any of these teens, and put them in the trap where they are covered in flammable fluid, with a poison in their system, an antidote in a safe, the combination painted all over the walls, and a single candle to see in the dark, these teens would most likely burn their own eye with the candle, or drop it and step on it, and accidentally get an infection from stepping all over the glass before the poison even takes effect on them.The Villains:So there're these two twins, siamese, and they're disconnected, but one is horribly disfigured because of it.

They're the kind of people you'd expect to be raised in a place like Beverly Hills without ever reading a book, watching something not on MTV or VH1, or even going to a private school but being homeschooled by apathetic tutors.  They're simply the sort of people you'd want to kill too if you were the bad guys in the film.The Stupid:I'm going to list specific examples, but really there's a lot more.- Paris Hilton's character catches the killer off-guard: she's got a big wooden stick and manages to bash him in his mask.  He stumbles back, probably with his head reeling.  Paris Hilton proceeds to THROW AWAY the stick, and RUN.  This would be a semi-logical solution if the killer hadn't SLASHED her Achilles Tendon moments earlier.  She's dead a few moments later.- Elisha Cuthbert's character is strapped to a chair in the basement of a gas station by the other brother.  Her lips are sealed with some sort of glue or wax.  The boyfriend shows up outside, and the brother is talking to him.  She can see them through a metal grill above her.  She manages to get free.  Rather than work on prying her lips open, she LOOKS AWAY, and STICKS HER FINGER THROUGH THE GRILL.  The brother swiftly reaches down and CUTS OFF THE TIP OF HER FINGER.  Only then does she bother to try and pry her lips open with her hands.- The teens are camping in a big open field.  A pick-up truck pulls up with the headlights on.  The kids call out to the driver, who doesn't respond.  One of the teens chucks a beer bottle and breaks one of the headlights.  The car inconspicuously drives off.  Clearly, walking the short distance to the car and asking ""what's up?"" took more effort than hurling a glass bottle that distance with the intent of creating a lawsuit if the driver weren't one of the killers.- The killer has been knocked unconscious by the Cuthbert's boyfriend character.  They don't bother to check if he's dead, nor do they bother to ENSURE that he's dead after shooting him once in the chest with a miniature crossbow that is most likely just a prop or a weapon for hunting animals rather than a human-killing device.- Elisha Cuthbert and/or her boyfriend think it's no big deal to be obnoxious, rude, and suspicious of a random guy who's offered to drive you into town when you're stranded in the woods.  This is well before they've encountered anyone remotely threatening.BONUS Killer stupidity: - It's apparently a good idea to build an entire house out of wax in LOUISIANA.  This brings back memories from ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" in which that Indian nobleman hired Wonka to build him a palace made of Chocolate.  In India.So here you have a small sampling of the rampant stupid which makes the teens in this movie too stupid to live.

No, it's not fantastic, but for what it is, it is a surprisingly competent and well made little slasher thriller. It's not just what people who haven't seen it would think it would be. It has a pretty cast, so most would probably think this is another teen horror movie straight from the pages of Abercrombie And Fitch. But this movie has a dark and grimey look and feel to it, and seems to try to be more ""Texas Chainsaw Masacre"" than ""Urban Legend"". Having not seen the original Vincent Price film, I cannot compare. It is nice that one of the villains is named, you guessed it, Vincent. The story?. Six teens are on a little road trip to see a football game. As expected in films of this nature, there is some car trouble and people getting stranded. Carly and Wade(Elisha Cuthbert, Jared Padalecki)are taken to the small town of Ambrose. The town that time forgot, apparently. Soon, they find out that things are not what they seem to be. When the local mechanic takes them to his house to get a fan belt, all hell breaks loose. The town has a house of wax, but it appears that the whole town's residents are in wax. Two crazy brothers take these unsuspecting motorists and turn them into real life wax figures. The whole town is filled with them, and the entire town is rigged up as if it is alive and booming and there are people there. The film is well set up, and the production design is quite fantastic. The director(whose name I am not even going to attempt to try to write)really sets up some nice scenes and shots and well paid off. The film has a nice look to it, and it all feels very real. The movie is abnormally long for a teen horror flick, and the beginning does drag on a bit too long and things get kinda boring before anything really heats up. The cast is pretty decent. First off, Paris Hilton. Her role is nothing that any high school drama student couldn't do, but such as it is, she wasn't that bad. People will think she was and convince you she was because she is Paris Hilton, but she didn't embarras herself. And yes, Paris' death is quite cool and is the worst of all the victims. When she died, did anyone else sit there watching and were waiting for her to say ""that's not hot""?. Elisha Cuthbert is a sexy beauty who makes for a decently strong heroine. Chad Michael Murray got better as time went on, but in the beginning,  he wasn't pulling off the ""bad twin"" thing too well. It was more of a caricature than anything else. The villains themselves are interesting. Brian Van Holt plays the twins, and his Bo is a pretty eye catching character. He is fun to watch. The Vincent character is not as great as Bo, but does have some creepy moments. This movie is low on the body count. Only 4 people die, and that is not counting Bo and Vincent. Anybody looking for a large body count will be disappointed. But I liked that it wasn't about a large body count, but about the situation and environment itself. The film's climax is amazing. The fire starts and the heroes and villains have a final fight in the melting house of wax. This part was amazingly done and is a lot of fun to watch. It is one moment in a film where there are a few clever and well done scenes that really pay off. But this end fight and chase is very cool. In the end, House Of Wax probably won't set the world of horror on fire, but it is a surprisingly enjoyable and entertaining way to spend 2 hours if you like this kind of thing. It could of used some editing, mostly in the beginning, but otherwise there is more good and well done things here than bad.",3,Waxy Build Up,1130976000,"11 3, 2005",2005,3684,"['surprise', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'travesty', 'other', 'reviews', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'No', 'not', 'fantastic', 'what', 'surprisingly', 'competent', 'well', 'made', 'little', 'slasher', 'thriller', 'not', 'just', 'what', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'cast', 'most', 'would', 'probably', 'think', 'teen', 'horror', 'movie', 'straight', 'pages', 'Abercrombie', 'Fitch', 'movie', 'dark', 'grimey', 'look', 'feel', 'try', 'be', 'more', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Masacre', 'Urban', 'Legend', 'Having', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'nice', 'one', 'villains', 'named', 'guessed', 'Vincent', 'story', 'Six', 'teens', 'are', 'little', 'road', 'trip', 'see', 'football', 'game', 'expected', 'films', 'nature', 'car', 'trouble', 'people', 'getting', 'stranded', 'Carly', 'Wade', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'are', 'taken', 'small', 'town', 'Ambrose', 'town', 'time', 'forgot', 'apparently', 'Soon', 'find', 'out', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'When', 'local', 'mechanic', 'house', 'get', 'fan', 'belt', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'town', 'house', 'wax', 'whole', 'town', 'residents', 'are', 'wax', 'Two', 'crazy', 'brothers', 'take', 'unsuspecting', 'motorists', 'turn', 'real', 'life', 'wax', 'figures', 'whole', 'town', 'filled', 'entire', 'town', 'rigged', 'up', 'alive', 'booming', 'are', 'people', 'there', 'film', 'well', 'set', 'up', 'production', 'design', 'quite', 'fantastic', 'director', 'name', 'am', 'not', 'even', 'going', 'attempt', 'try', 'write', 'really', 'up', 'nice', 'scenes', 'shots', 'well', 'paid', 'off', 'film', 'nice', 'look', 'feels', 'very', 'real', 'movie', 'abnormally', 'long', 'teen', 'horror', 'flick', 'beginning', 'drag', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'things', 'get', 'kinda', 'boring', 'anything', 'really', 'up', 'cast', 'pretty', 'decent', 'First', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'role', 'nothing', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'student', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'such', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'People', 'will', 'think', 'was', 'convince', 'was', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'did', ""n't"", 'embarras', 'yes', 'Paris', 'death', 'quite', 'cool', 'worst', 'victims', 'When', 'died', 'did', 'anyone', 'else', 'sit', 'there', 'watching', 'were', 'waiting', 'say', 'not', 'hot', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'sexy', 'beauty', 'who', 'decently', 'strong', 'heroine', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'got', 'better', 'time', 'went', 'beginning', 'was', ""n't"", 'pulling', 'off', 'bad', 'twin', 'thing', 'too', 'well', 'was', 'more', 'caricature', 'anything', 'else', 'villains', 'are', 'interesting', 'Brian', 'Van', 'Holt', 'twins', 'Bo', 'pretty', 'eye', 'catching', 'character', 'fun', 'watch', 'Vincent', 'character', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'Bo', 'have', 'creepy', 'moments', 'movie', 'low', 'body', 'count', 'Only', '4', 'people', 'die', 'not', 'counting', 'Bo', 'Vincent', 'Anybody', 'looking', 'large', 'body', 'count', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'liked', 'was', ""n't"", 'large', 'body', 'count', 'situation', 'environment', 'film', 'climax', 'amazing', 'fire', 'heroes', 'villains', 'have', 'final', 'fight', 'melting', 'house', 'wax', 'part', 'was', 'amazingly', 'done', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'one', 'moment', 'film', 'where', 'are', 'few', 'clever', 'well', 'done', 'scenes', 'really', 'pay', 'off', 'end', 'fight', 'chase', 'very', 'cool', 'end', 'House', 'Wax', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'set', 'world', 'horror', 'fire', 'surprisingly', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'way', 'spend', '2', 'hours', 'like', 'kind', 'thing', 'could', 'used', 'editing', 'mostly', 'beginning', 'otherwise', 'more', 'good', 'well', 'done', 'things', 'here', 'bad']",N/A

When Jared Padalecki is shaved and placed in a wax shower, for instance, the film is appropriately gruesome and fun. When the entire set comes tumbling down around the characters, that part is the best. And, as I said, Paris Hilton's death scene is reason enough to buy the ticket.",2,Generally way bad.

The most obvious theme is the house of wax device, which has been the background for several different movies, several done with significantly different plot premises. Aside from the house of wax background, the plot outline comes straight from the hoary Halloween / Friday the 13th / Texas Chainsaw Massacre slashfests.There is little of the nuevo-horror cleverness we find in the `Saw' or `Ring' flicks. In fact, this movie owes far more to `Texas Chainsaw' than it does to previous Wax Museum premises. One of the main perps comes straight out of leatherface's playbook.While I am not a big fan of your average slasher flick, I do find at least two aspects of this film which elevate it slightly above the average, albeit not quite into the same realm as the classic originals, `Halloween' and the very first `Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. Since I am therefore giving this flick a modest recommendation, I will not state what these are.I will say that while the primary perps get their due, the movie does leave a hook dangling at the end of the movie to create the basis for a follow-up.Matching the above average level of the script and premise is above average acting, especially by the actors doing the two primary vics and the lead perp.",4,Good slasher in Halloween / Texas Chainsaw tradition,1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,1355,"['House', 'Wax', 'directed', 'Jaume', 'Collet-Serra', 'reasonably', 'creative', 'take', 'two', 'different', 'horror', 'film', 'themes', 'most', 'obvious', 'theme', 'house', 'wax', 'device', 'been', 'background', 'several', 'different', 'movies', 'several', 'done', 'significantly', 'different', 'plot', 'premises', 'Aside', 'house', 'wax', 'background', 'plot', 'outline', 'straight', 'hoary', 'Halloween', '/', 'Friday', '13th', '/', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'little', 'nuevo-horror', 'cleverness', 'find', 'Saw', 'Ring', 'flicks', 'fact', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'previous', 'Wax', 'Museum', 'One', 'main', 'perps', 'straight', 'leatherface', 'playbook.While', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'average', 'slasher', 'flick', 'do', 'find', 'least', 'two', 'aspects', 'film', 'elevate', 'slightly', 'average', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'realm', 'classic', 'originals', 'Halloween', 'very', 'first', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'am', 'therefore', 'giving', 'flick', 'modest', 'recommendation', 'will', 'not', 'state', 'what', 'are.I', 'will', 'say', 'primary', 'perps', 'get', 'due', 'movie', 'leave', 'hook', 'dangling', 'end', 'movie', 'create', 'basis', 'follow-up.Matching', 'above', 'average', 'level', 'script', 'premise', 'above', 'average', 'acting', 'especially', 'actors', 'doing', 'two', 'primary', 'vics', 'lead', 'perp']",N/A
927955,A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ,B000AM4P9K,Boggman!,"[2, 3]","""House of Wax"" is a fairly amusing, completely far-fetched film that delivers to us one thing for sure: GORE. As a true horror movie fan, the film gets 3 stars on that basis alone.The movie really lacks any sort of story, and requires the audience to really suspend their belief in order to believe the films premise. A whole town, in the middle of nowhere (not even on the map) complete with mechanical wax figures designed to look like living townspeople, an actual house built of wax, 3 resident psychopaths;  and nobody's aware of its existence at all?? Well, it's a tough pill to swallow.The leads (Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray) seem to do well with the dialogue & story they are given, which isn't much. However, reality aside, ""House Of Wax"" delivers with its killings, special effects, and graphic violence.For this reviewer, the price of admission was worth it just to see Paris Hilton receive a steel pipe through the head, in one of the films best death sequences. Fantastic!House of Wax has many borrowed clich&eacute;s throughout its entirety. Nothing about this film could in any way, shape, or form could be construed as ""original"". Nor, would I really call it a remake of the classic Vincent Price film. It's more of a re-imagining to say the least. The wax figures displayed throughout the movie were also quite creepy, which was a plus +.Still, I enjoyed the ""House of Wax"" for what it is. A ""recycled"" teenage slasher movie with some good gory death sequences involving stupid young adults who ignore EVERY sign possible; and as a result, get wiped out one by one.Don't expect too much from this one.....but still, not a total disappointment either.",3,Waxwork,1115769600,"05 11, 2005",2005,1676,"['House', 'Wax', 'fairly', 'amusing', 'completely', 'far-fetched', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'sure', 'GORE', 'true', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'film', '3', 'stars', 'basis', 'alone.The', 'movie', 'really', 'sort', 'story', 'audience', 'really', 'suspend', 'belief', 'order', 'believe', 'films', 'premise', 'whole', 'town', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'not', 'even', 'map', 'complete', 'mechanical', 'wax', 'figures', 'designed', 'look', 'living', 'townspeople', 'actual', 'house', 'built', 'wax', '3', 'resident', 'psychopaths', 'nobody', 'aware', 'existence', 'Well', 'tough', 'pill', 'swallow.The', 'leads', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'seem', 'do', 'well', 'dialogue', 'story', 'are', 'given', ""n't"", 'much', 'However', 'reality', 'aside', 'House', 'Wax', 'delivers', 'killings', 'special', 'effects', 'graphic', 'violence.For', 'reviewer', 'price', 'admission', 'was', 'worth', 'just', 'see', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'receive', 'steel', 'pipe', 'head', 'one', 'films', 'best', 'death', 'sequences', 'Fantastic', 'House', 'Wax', 'many', 'borrowed', 'clich', 'eacute', 'entirety', 'Nothing', 'film', 'could', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'could', 'be', 'construed', 'original', 'would', 'really', 'call', 'remake', 'classic', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'film', 'more', 're-imagining', 'say', 'least', 'wax', 'displayed', 'movie', 'were', 'also', 'quite', 'creepy', 'was', 'plus', '+.Still', 'enjoyed', 'House', 'Wax', 'what', 'recycled', 'teenage', 'slasher', 'movie', 'good', 'gory', 'death', 'sequences', 'involving', 'stupid', 'young', 'adults', 'who', 'ignore', 'EVERY', 'sign', 'possible', 'result', 'get', 'wiped', 'out', 'one', 'one.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'one', '..but', 'still', 'not', 'total', 'disappointment', 'either']",N/A
927956,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B000AM4P9K,Boss Fan,"[7, 10]","Its easy to be hard on movies like ""House of Wax.""  Most of the time they deserve it.  Every once in a while one comes along and despite its lazy writing, poor performances and lack of originality, it is somehow effective at generating fear or suspense, or it has some elements, be them a stylish look, inovative camera techniques, pleasent characters, smart writing, etc, that make it work in spite of itself and inspite of the fact that we all know it is the same old hokum.""House of Wax"" is not one of these films.""Wax"" is the other movie; the kind that is just more of the same and often worse.  At best it is just a complete waste of time.  At worst it is a disgusting mess.  And in the middle there is all the maddening clieches that mar all the worst horror movies and, most unfortunately, all these recent ""teen horror"" flicks.  As someone who was a has only been out of my teens for a short time, it is truely disturbing to see all the positive reviews posted here from those just a few years younger than me.  The generation gap between X and Y is truely bigger than I ever imagined.  This is why whatever forgettable horror movie of the week constantly debuts atop the box office charts and then rapidly declines in the following weeks.  Thanks kids!  ""House of Wax"" couldn't even mange this modest feat, however, as it was DOA in something like 5th place its opening weekend.Maybe we are bridging the gap.Hey, I understand the alure of a good horror movie.  A-GOOD-HORROR-MOVIE.  Classics like ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Shining,"" for instance, not withstanding (because I don't expect that level of greatness or smarts from every escapist horror flick), I loved the recent ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake for its attempt to reimagine the tried and true.  Ah, there's the key word:  imagine; as in ""imagination.""  ""House of Wax"" does not exist because the director and producers had such fondness for the original that it galvenized them into wanting to do something just as great someday.  Hell, I don't think the original is even regarded as a good film (no offense to the legendary Vincent Price).  This is simply a product of the same cash machine that keeps pimping history for ideas in place of actually coming up with new ones for today.  So we get retreds of ""House of Wax,"" ""Dukes of Hazard,"" et al that are made on the cheap and with zero passion and love for the original.  I'd settle for the passion just to make a good, interesting and semi-original film.  ""Saw,"" for instance, had its problems, but at least it tried something new, and it was a project its young writers/directors risked a lot on to get it into theatres because it was something they believed in and worked hard on.None of that can be said for ""House of Wax"" and its ilk.  The scenario isn't even worth mentioning since it is the same as pretty much every horror movie involving a group of teens since the begining of time.  Kids' car breaks down in the most remote, inbread place possible.  They kill time by bickering drinking and screwing while, one by one, they are picked off in various disgusting yet logic-defying ways.  And they all deserve it because they make the dumbest decissions possible at any givin moment.  For instance, What the hell is Paris Hilton doing running downstairs to get away from a fkiller who is trying to stab her from underneath a catwalk?!  I know the old joke is everyone runs upstairs when they shouldn't, but if the killer is underneath you, you go up not down if you want to get away, right?  And lets talk about Paris Hilton.  How is it that she somehow gives the most grounded and realistic performance in the film?  Don't get me wrong, she needn't ready her Oscar speech anytime soon, but she is the only one who is NOT constantly irritating; when pretty much everything else you've seen her in she is the MOST annoying person.  If nothing else does, this demonstrates just how far from reality this film strays.  Perhaps she is able to pull off this feat because her screentime is limited compared to the rest of the cast.  Which brings me to another observation.  Hilton's scenes are so spread out, one gets the feeling that she was originaly to be a glorified cameo and should have been offed much sooner than she was, but the makers had to drag her as far into the film as possible by editing her scenes far appart.  Notice how long it takes her and her boyfriend to get down to business.  Scene after scene goes by of other characters running for their lives, yet after these long stretches of time Hilton is shown doing the same thing she was doing the last time we saw her.The movie is awash in bad filmmaking moves such as that.  It takes an hour - a friggin' hour - for the killer to start getting down to business!  That is what you call a waste of time in a movie like this.  Even if you love these type of movies, you should resent the hell out of one that takes an hour to get to the stuff that is the only reason you showed up in the first place.  You aren't watching it for an hour-long set-up of a story that literally takes less than a minute to sum up.It is also laugh-out-loud insane the way the characters in this movie get their fingers cut off, achillies (spelling?) snipped in two, not to mention the usual shootings, stabbings and burnings, and just walk it off (!).  I know it's old hat that Stallone and such get shot or what-have-you and just keep on shooting back; but when a teenager has her finger cut off and has to to rip her super-glued lips apart (which is really stupid - even for this movie), I expect her to notice.Which brings me to poor Elisha Cuthbert, the would-be actress expected to anchor this mess. I liked her on ""24,"" at least until they ran out of interesting and plausable things to do with her character, and I loved her in ""The Girl Next Door.""  So why was I so annoyed by her in this movie?  I'm gonna hope its the movies fault and not the actress.  Sometimes the stink rubs off and you just can't drag yourself out of the muck.  And this dreck drags everyone down, even the usually reliable action king, producer Joel Silver (""Lethal Weapon,"" ""Die Hard,"" ""The Matrix"").It's a credit to Silver that this movie gets even 1 star.  There are possibilities here.  None of them apear until late, late in this over-long trek, and even then they all ultimately fall by the wayside, but they are there.  The actual house of wax is neat and the finale in which it burns of even neater; and there is cool sequence in a movie theatre.  Also, the idea of a whole town of wax people is at least is an intersting hook.  But they never do anything with it other than use it as a canvas to stage all the dull, usual mayhem.  They couldn't do much else with it, though.  It is preposterous to think someone in any town, no matter how remote, could turn its entire population to wax statues and not raise any eyebrows.God, this movie is stupid!So, what do we have here in this house of wax?  Crude remake?  Check.  Attractive young cast?  Check.  Wrong turn into a deserted hick town with strange doin's-a-transpirin'?  Check.  Killer that drives a big scary truck and does what he does because of childhood trauma?  Check.  Cast is picked off one by one after making stupid decisions and failing to realize that, somehow the killer always knows what they are gonna do and will be one step ahead of them?  Check.Refund?  Ah, not so fast.I can't get my money back, but I can try to save you from wasting your's on admission to this house of wax.You've seen it all before anyway.",1,IF ONLY MY EYES WERE MADE OF

Working against it are all of the cliched Teen Horror trademarks found in its pretty cast, gratuitous sex, and cheap scares, let alone the fact that it was produced through Dark Castle Entertainment, notorious for such trashy remakes as HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL or THIR13EN GHOSTS. Now, no one is arguing that this is a great Horror film, because it's not, but it is a genuine good time and a guilty pleasure for gore and Slasher fans. It takes the basic premise of the two original films, kicks up the pace, chucks a bucket of blood in their faces, and in an unexpected surprise, even manages to top the design through its impressive special FX and set work. Sure, you can't name a single character by the end of the film, but who really cares when most of them are just pins to be knocked down by the blade wielding brothers? The derivative plot is just familiar enough to maintain interest until the blood starts spewing, and from that moment on it is one brutal death after another for each of the Barbie doll characters.

Another remake, of course, with the way things are going every single movie of my childhood will have been remade by 2009, and this movie will have been remade again by 2011. Are there no original ideas out there? Is anyone actually sitting down and writing screenplays. I have personally read about 20 plus horror novels that would translate quite well into movies, is anyone even paying attention? And most of the remakes...are getting a sequel which KILLS me.I knew ahead of time that Parasite Hilton was in this, so I wasn't thrown off my couch with disgust as soon as I saw her hair extensions and wonky eye. I just wished they had killed her off in the first five minutes, maybe had her choke on her own vomit as soon as she saw her reflection in the diner's windows. Oh well. Elisha Cuthbert, that redneck from the WB, and some really hot guy playing Vincent/Bo round out the cast. There are other people but they are forgettable. The story is so simple, so unoriginal, so ridiculous that halfway into it your still wondering what all these people are doing out of their own neighborhoods. They were all going to a football game I guess, got lost and had to camp out? Some one sabotages one of the vehicles? Listen if that happened to me, all of us would have piled into the one vehicle, seriously. After that we see the House of wax, the town of wax, the dogs of wax, a funeral of wax, I was itching to grab a ginormous Cotton Swab.There were apparently, conjoined twin boys, who were unconjoined and one was bad the other was good. Their mum Trudy was a wax making fiend and their dad was a doctor until their mom died of cancer and the dad killed himself. BUT not before totally scarring these children for life by surrounding them with wax and or duct taping them to high chairs and making them wear hideous hippie leather sandals. So these boys grew up, and one ""Vincent"" (a nod to the original how nice) is the wax artist who takes people and sprays them with wax then dresses them up and poses them he is deformed (of course he is!), and the other ""Bo"" (a nod to the dukes of hazard?) is the bully who actually seeks out the people for Vince to sculpt. Having taught Arts and Crafts at the YMCA for many years, I personally know that wax, does NOT set up that fast, and you cannot spray someone, sculpt them, add hair , dress them and put them on display in about two hours, not that I have tried that.....I have to admit that *some* of the effects were pretty cool, I give them high fives for using less CGI and more solid/melty props. It wasn't a bit frightening, or even gross, or original, it was just a dumpload of wax in a minimally entertaining movie.

Your basic teen slasher flick about young campers getting lost in Hicksville and brutally murdered by psycho inbred rednecks. The characters are flat, they exist only to be victims and villains and during the chase scenes our young victims make the same classic mistakes.So why should you see `House of Wax'? The movie delivers what it promises, Elisha Cuthbert and Paris Hilton in their underwear and skimpy outfits. Yes there's plenty of R rated blood and guts. (none of that PG-13 nonsense)The production quality is also above average. Not James Cameron quality, but the camera stays in focus, the set is properly lit, and the editing makes sense. I'm not joking when I say that 90 percent of the films in the last few years could not live up to those three criteria.My major beef with `House of Wax' is a very nasty scene half way through where Elisha Cuthbert has her index finger cut off with scissors. So for the second half of the movie each time we see Elisha we are disgusted by how she is in pain without medical treatment. Gross! Starlets being killed is expected, starlets suffering horribly is just plain revolting.I and the other Elishaphiles online were very pleased to see that Elisha Cuthbert received top billing for `House of Wax' after all she is the lead character and biggest star.

A group of hot and horny teenagers are going somewhere only to have car trouble/want to stop for the night. Then stuff happens and people die, gruesomely. It's been used many times in films and you're really wondering whether Hollywood has a machine that just automatically greenlights films.Group of teenagers are going to a football game(and not even having tickets) decide it's late so they should camp out. So they pick a spot only to find a weird truck that's bugging them and a bad smell. They end up needing to fix their car so they go to a nearby town which features something odd: the titular house made entirely of wax. Even the stairs and floors. And then of course people get offed.Now of course when you have a teen horror film, 2 things will happen: any character introduced will have to do something ""important"" whether they die, live or part of the story. So if there's a twist regarding the identity of somebody, it's usually gonna be someone already shown like here(I guessed the ending loooong before the film did). And anybody that dies will have the survivors find them and be all ""no....no!"". It's here too.Now for anyone curious as to Paris' ""acting"" well it's as you would imagine it would be. And how rare is it that you would cheer when she gets hers? That isn't a spoiler by the way as there were literally t-shirts that said something along the lines of ""this friday, watch Paris die"" or something.

927973,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000AM4P9K,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[6, 6]","It's best if you don't look at House of Wax as a remake of the Vincent Price classic, as the two have very little in common.  Still, it's hard not to go into this movie with a slightly negative attitude, given that whole ""remake"" stigma and the fact that Paris Hilton plays a significant part in the story.  Personally, I pretty much expected to be disappointed.  The first half hour didn't do anything to change my perspective, really.  You've got a stereotypical group of young people camping out in the woods on their way to a big football game, and you eventually start asking yourself, ""Wasn't there supposed to be a whole House of Wax thing in this movie?""  There's a menacing truck kind of thing, but that's about as scary as cutting your fingernails.  Still, you do get to know the characters a little bit - not that you would really want to know most of them.  The only interesting character is Carly (Elisha Cuthbert), a seemingly smart young lady with an actual future.  She's unhappy because her friend Paige (Paris Hilton) and her loverboy invited her brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray) and his loser friend along on the trip, as it sort of puts a cramp in her lifeless style of her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki).  Nick's supposedly a tough guy with a prison record, living up to his label as the evil half of the Jones twins.Nothing really happens until Wade wakes up to find his car has been damaged.  While their friends head off to the big game, Wade and Carly make their way to the nearby town of Ambrose, home of the once-famous Trudy House of Wax, in search of a fan belt.  They should have known things just weren't right when they found the town basically deserted, with Whatever Happened to Baby Charlotte? listed on the marquee of the local movie house.  Wade's a real nosy Ned who thinks he has the right to trespass anywhere he pleases, including the closed wax museum.  The pair do manage to find a mechanic eventually, though, which sounds like a good thing but really isn't - because that's when things finally begin to take a rather gruesome, bloody turn.  In time, all of the major characters find their way into the increasingly surreal town of Ambrose - but all of them do not make it back out.  As you can probably deduce by the title, the designated bad guy(s) here are much too lazy to make wax sculptures from scratch - it's just so much easier (not to mention more lifelike) when you can just cover an actual person in wax.Much to my surprise, this actually turned out to be a pretty good slasher film.  The problem, of course, is the fact that we're so inured to slasher films that it's almost impossible to make a really effective one anymore.  For me, the whole situation never managed to generate a truly effective sense of menace.  For one thing, there's no mystery as to who the bad guys are; even Shaggy and Scooby Doo could have figured this one out, since there are only two people in the whole town.  Wax or no wax, we've seen all of this before.  Some of the deaths are fairly entertaining, though (although I would have preferred more gore and a more direct look at the actual killing moments).These aren't the brightest kids you'll ever see.  First off, they go and take a shortcut on their big road trip - that always lead you to some detour into the heart of hillbilly monster country.  When they should be running, they choose instead to try and hide underneath the nose of the killers, and, naturally, they actually keep going back into danger to try and find their missing friends.  If I ever find myself in a ghost town full of wax dummies, hunted by some sick freak wanting to add me to an exhibit in his wax museum, I'm going to run until my legs fall off.  After all, friendship means not having to say you're sorry when you leave your buddies behind to die horrible deaths.  I don't guess that would make an interesting movie, though.I guess I should address the whole Paris Hilton thing here.  Believe it or not, she is not the worst actress in Hollywood; you aren't going to spend any time at the water cooler telling your buddies what an incredible performance Paris gave in this film, but she isn't all that bad in a role such as this.  She could never have handled the primary role of Carly (since, after all, we're supposed to root for Carly to survive), but she's quite acceptable as fodder for deranged killers.",4,Much better than I expected,1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,4383,"['best', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'House', 'Wax', 'remake', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'classic', 'two', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'common', 'Still', 'hard', 'not', 'go', 'movie', 'slightly', 'negative', 'attitude', 'given', 'whole', 'remake', 'stigma', 'fact', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'significant', 'part', 'story', 'Personally', 'pretty', 'much', 'expected', 'be', 'disappointed', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'change', 'perspective', 'really', ""'ve"", 'got', 'stereotypical', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'camping', 'out', 'woods', 'way', 'big', 'football', 'game', 'eventually', 'start', 'asking', 'Was', ""n't"", 'there', 'supposed', 'be', 'whole', 'House', 'Wax', 'thing', 'movie', 'menacing', 'truck', 'kind', 'thing', 'about', 'as', 'scary', 'cutting', 'fingernails', 'Still', 'do', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'little', 'bit', 'not', 'would', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'most', 'only', 'interesting', 'character', 'Carly', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'seemingly', 'smart', 'young', 'lady', 'actual', 'future', 'unhappy', 'friend', 'Paige', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'loverboy', 'invited', 'brother', 'Nick', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'loser', 'friend', 'trip', 'sort', 'cramp', 'lifeless', 'style', 'boyfriend', 'Wade', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'Nick', 'supposedly', 'tough', 'guy', 'prison', 'record', 'living', 'up', 'label', 'evil', 'half', 'Jones', 'twins.Nothing', 'really', 'Wade', 'up', 'find', 'car', 'been', 'damaged', 'friends', 'head', 'big', 'game', 'Wade', 'Carly', 'make', 'way', 'nearby', 'town', 'Ambrose', 'home', 'once-famous', 'Trudy', 'House', 'Wax', 'search', 'fan', 'belt', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'things', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'right', 'when', 'found', 'town', 'basically', 'deserted', 'Happened', 'Baby', 'Charlotte', 'listed', 'marquee', 'local', 'movie', 'house', 'Wade', 'real', 'nosy', 'Ned', 'who', 'right', 'trespass', 'anywhere', 'including', 'closed', 'wax', 'museum', 'pair', 'do', 'manage', 'find', 'mechanic', 'eventually', 'good', 'thing', 'really', ""n't"", 'when', 'things', 'finally', 'begin', 'take', 'rather', 'gruesome', 'bloody', 'turn', 'time', 'major', 'characters', 'find', 'way', 'increasingly', 'surreal', 'town', 'Ambrose', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'back', 'out', 'can', 'probably', 'deduce', 'title', 'designated', 'bad', 'guy', 's', 'here', 'are', 'much', 'too', 'lazy', 'make', 'wax', 'sculptures', 'scratch', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'not', 'mention', 'more', 'lifelike', 'when', 'can', 'just', 'cover', 'actual', 'person', 'wax.Much', 'surprise', 'actually', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'slasher', 'film', 'problem', 'course', 'fact', ""'re"", 'so', 'inured', 'slasher', 'films', 'almost', 'impossible', 'make', 'really', 'effective', 'one', 'anymore', 'whole', 'situation', 'never', 'managed', 'generate', 'truly', 'effective', 'sense', 'menace', 'one', 'thing', 'mystery', 'who', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'even', 'Shaggy', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'could', 'have', 'figured', 'one', 'out', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'people', 'whole', 'town', 'Wax', 'wax', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before', 'deaths', 'are', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'though', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'gore', 'more', 'direct', 'look', 'actual', 'killing', 'moments', '.These', 'are', ""n't"", 'brightest', 'kids', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'First', 'off', 'go', 'take', 'shortcut', 'big', 'road', 'trip', 'always', 'lead', 'detour', 'heart', 'hillbilly', 'monster', 'country', 'When', 'should', 'be', 'running', 'choose', 'instead', 'try', 'hide', 'nose', 'killers', 'naturally', 'actually', 'keep', 'going', 'back', 'danger', 'try', 'find', 'missing', 'friends', 'ever', 'find', 'ghost', 'town', 'full', 'wax', 'dummies', 'hunted', 'sick', 'freak', 'wanting', 'add', 'exhibit', 'wax', 'museum', ""'m"", 'going', 'run', 'legs', 'fall', 'off', 'friendship', 'not', 'having', 'say', ""'re"", 'sorry', 'when', 'leave', 'buddies', 'die', 'horrible', 'deaths', 'do', ""n't"", 'guess', 'would', 'make', 'interesting', 'movie', 'though.I', 'guess', 'should', 'address', 'whole', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'thing', 'here', 'Believe', 'not', 'not', 'worst', 'actress', 'Hollywood', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'spend', 'time', 'water', 'cooler', 'telling', 'buddies', 'what', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Paris', 'gave', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', 'role', 'such', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'handled', 'primary', 'role', 'Carly', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'root', 'Carly', 'survive', 'quite', 'acceptable', 'fodder', 'deranged', 'killers']",N/A

Maybe they say nasty things to you in a sharp tone.You don't want to eat Cheerios.Who the Hell is gonna put up with that? Huh? So I can totally understand that such a child would grow up to be a batsh*t crazy lunatic who carves his victims up into bloody pieces and slathers them all with a nice, fast-acting, check-out-that-shiny-gleam spray-on wax and props them up in his own little wax museum.

Where are my bubbling vats of molten stuff, where are the panty-clad beauties dipped squealing into gallons of the soupy hot goop, blistering as they sink and form and hiss and sizzle?Nah, here the loony just sprays the waxy junk on, nothing fiercer than what you're gonna get if you while away a few hours at one of those high-end Arizona day spas.

Directing--Very nicely done from Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan). The film has an overall creepy and tense atmosphere throughout. Good job!2.  Script--Again, nicely written from Chad and Carey Hayes. Nice dialogue throughout from all the characters and it is a very interesting and unique story with a very nice ending.3.  Acting--Amazing job from the entire cast. Most notable are Elisha Cuthbert and Brian Van Holt.Now for the content review.Rated R for horror violence, some sexual content and language1.  Sex/Nudity=0/10. This is the part I don't understand. The rating states ""some sexual content"" but there is nothing of the sort in the movie. Confused me on that part.2.  Violence/Gore=10/10. This movie is very gruesome. You get some pretty gory scenes such as the cutting of an Achille's tendon, a decapitation, a impalment through the head, a beating with a baseball bat, and a man getting turned into a wax statue and his flesh getting burned off. It's not as bad on violence as other horror movies nowadays, but it is still worthy of a 10/10.3.  Language=6/10. Another surprising element. Most modern-day horror movies have a lot of bad language. This however did not have that much. There were 6 F-words and other profanities.Final Thoughts...Overall--5/5. This is an awesome horror movie and it boasts good acting and amazing special effects. It had a good directing job and a unique storyline.

And another remake that desecrates the memory of its classic namesake to boot.Somebody bought me this as a gift because they know I love horror movies.  But unfortunately the slasher flick is just not the type of horror I like.Loving the original ""House of Wax"" and all things Vincent Price, I didn't even know that this was going to be a slasher flick till I started watching.  I should have known better.  Besides the huge exception of the remake of Battlestar Galactica, I cannot think of a single decent case in the endless list of pathetic remakes that Hollywood has had nothing better to do in the past 15 years or so than throw money away on.  Why do they even bother?Other than the amazing special effects at the ending, there was absolutely nothing here we haven't seen before in dozens of other films of this kind.  A bunch of stupid, obnoxious and randy teens on their way to a football game camp out near an isolated town.  Weird stuff happens. Turns out the town has a couple of psychos in it.  And one by one they get butchered, yadda-yadda......wake me when it's over.Being helmed by Hollywood strongman Joel Silver, this film does have a big budget and so its technical standards are high.  The film does look great.  But I HATED and despised ALL of the characters and felt like cheering every time one of them bit the dust (--maybe I was supposed to?)The ONLY thing I liked about this film was its design and special effects.  They designed a whole small town for this movie, including the very cool museum building of the title, which was made entirely of wax.  I have to salute them for the truly outstanding job they did on this.  And the effects in the grand finale of the movie (won't tell you anything but that it involves a LOT of wax!) were quite spectacular, I'll give them that.But does that make this worth buying?  Hell no.  If you must check it out, I would advise renting, as this is the kind of movie that you really won't want to watch more than once (if you can even stand that!).I don't know, I think the whole way Hollywood funds its movies and chooses its projects has GOT to change.  I am told that the reason there have been so many remakes in the past 15 years is because making a movie is so expensive these days that studios and their investors are afraid of taking a gamble on a completely new and unproven idea.  So instead they turn to remaking ideas that have been successful in the past, or that they feel already have ""brand name recognition"" with the movie-going public.But I think the huge list of failures that have continued to rack up over the past few years should wake them up by now that HELLO~, this strategy IS JUST NOT WORKING.  Throwing money at a project that is based on poorly thought-out retreads of old ideas, repopulated with obnoxious and stereotypical characters played by the latest ""hot stars"", and using hackneyed ideas stolen from dozens of other movies does not a good movie make.  A prime example of this is this movie.So I was a bit torn on how many stars to rate this movie.  If I had to grade it just on its technical merits, it should get 3 stars for sure.  But overall I still hated it, so I think it definitely should not get a passing grade from me.  So 2 stars it is.Hey Joel Silver, how about trying quality and originality in the story and characterization department too next time?",2,"2 stars all for FX & design, 0 for the story",1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,3440,"['Ho-hum', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'here', 'Oh', 'dumb', 'slasher', 'flick', 'teens', 'remake', 'memory', 'classic', 'namesake', 'boot.Somebody', 'bought', 'gift', 'know', 'love', 'horror', 'movies', 'unfortunately', 'slasher', 'flick', 'just', 'not', 'type', 'horror', 'like.Loving', 'original', 'House', 'Wax', 'things', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'slasher', 'flick', 'till', 'started', 'watching', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'huge', 'exception', 'remake', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'single', 'decent', 'case', 'endless', 'list', 'pathetic', 'remakes', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'past', '15', 'years', 'so', 'throw', 'money', 'away', 'Why', 'do', 'even', 'bother', 'Other', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'ending', 'was', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'dozens', 'other', 'films', 'kind', 'bunch', 'stupid', 'obnoxious', 'randy', 'teens', 'way', 'football', 'game', 'camp', 'out', 'isolated', 'town', 'Weird', 'stuff', 'out', 'town', 'couple', 'psychos', 'one', 'one', 'get', 'butchered', 'yadda-yadda', 'wake', 'when', 'over.Being', 'helmed', 'Hollywood', 'strongman', 'Joel', 'Silver', 'film', 'have', 'big', 'budget', 'so', 'technical', 'standards', 'are', 'high', 'film', 'look', 'great', 'HATED', 'despised', 'ALL', 'characters', 'felt', 'cheering', 'time', 'one', 'bit', 'dust', 'maybe', 'was', 'supposed', 'ONLY', 'thing', 'liked', 'film', 'was', 'design', 'special', 'effects', 'designed', 'whole', 'small', 'town', 'movie', 'including', 'very', 'cool', 'museum', 'building', 'title', 'was', 'made', 'entirely', 'wax', 'have', 'salute', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'job', 'did', 'effects', 'grand', 'finale', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anything', 'LOT', 'wax', 'were', 'quite', 'spectacular', ""'ll"", 'give', 'that.But', 'make', 'worth', 'buying', 'Hell', 'no', 'must', 'check', 'out', 'would', 'advise', 'renting', 'kind', 'movie', 'really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'can', 'even', 'stand', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'think', 'whole', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'funds', 'movies', 'projects', 'GOT', 'change', 'am', 'told', 'reason', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'remakes', 'past', '15', 'years', 'making', 'movie', 'so', 'expensive', 'days', 'studios', 'investors', 'are', 'afraid', 'taking', 'gamble', 'completely', 'new', 'unproven', 'idea', 'instead', 'turn', 'remaking', 'ideas', 'have', 'been', 'successful', 'past', 'feel', 'already', 'have', 'brand', 'name', 'recognition', 'movie-going', 'public.But', 'think', 'huge', 'list', 'failures', 'have', 'continued', 'rack', 'up', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'should', 'wake', 'up', 'now', 'HELLO~', 'strategy', 'JUST', 'NOT', 'WORKING', 'Throwing', 'money', 'project', 'based', 'poorly', 'thought-out', 'retreads', 'old', 'ideas', 'repopulated', 'obnoxious', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'played', 'latest', 'hot', 'stars', 'using', 'hackneyed', 'ideas', 'stolen', 'dozens', 'other', 'movies', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'make', 'prime', 'example', 'movie.So', 'was', 'bit', 'torn', 'how', 'many', 'stars', 'rate', 'movie', 'had', 'grade', 'just', 'technical', 'merits', 'should', 'get', '3', 'stars', 'sure', 'overall', 'still', 'hated', 'so', 'think', 'definitely', 'should', 'not', 'get', 'passing', 'grade', 'So', '2', 'stars', 'Joel', 'Silver', 'how', 'trying', 'quality', 'originality', 'story', 'characterization', 'department', 'too', 'next', 'time']",N/A

Come on, most of the people who went to see it were probably dying (no pun intended) to see it happen. Sadly, Hilton's death is attached to the remake of ""House of Wax,"" a campy screamflick about Madame Tussaud's gone bad. Good Lord.Six nubile twentysomethings are en route to a basebell game when (surprise surprise) they break down. They stay overnight in a creepy forest, only to have their car sabotaged by a mystery driver -- and just how does a fan belt break in a stopped car? Sabotage. A few hitch a ride into the town, and soon find that the town is even weirder than an episode of ""The Simple Life.""The feel is 1960s-ish. The buildings are literally made of wax. Corpses are being dumped in pits in the woods. And there is a creepy museum called the House of Wax, with some very suspicious-looking figures in it. And worst of all, someone seems to be hell-bent on adding our clueless protagonists to the House of Wax.To be honest, ""House of Wax"" reminds me of an old ""Get Smart"" episode I once saw, except that that episode was more fun. In fact, ""House of Wax"" is so cliched and so bad that it actually comes across as a parody. We have clueless young people, girls in skimpy attire (including Hilton in red lingerie), redneck psychos, blood and body parts, and death by sharp objects. All it needs is a screaming virgin.Well, at least it doesn't pretend to be clever or innovative. It doesn't even try.What is good? The wax effects, and the climactic blaze. And it does have some entertainment value as a cliched cheesefest. The script is a bad hybrid of ""Halloween,"" Vincent Price, and one of the worse episodes of ""X-Files,"" and sadly the direction follows in kind. It has a B-movie flavour, despite the more polished filming techniques.The climax is probably the most worthwhile part of the whole movie, when a fire causes the House of Wax to melt. The special effects are pretty amusing. Seeing people fall through stairs and walls is actually kind of fun, as is the gruesome scene where we see someone getting a wax job. (Rim shot)The acting here is strictly scream-horror fare, meaning it's bad. Not entertainingly bad, just forgettably bad. Despite the unsurprising disaster of Hilton's performance, she's no better or worse than the other stars here, such as Elisha Cuthbert or Chad Michael Murray. All of them are playing one-note idiots -- acting doesn't enter into it, and the best moments are right before people die.The most entertainment ""House of Wax"" can bring you is a drinking time, where you take a swig every time a horror cliche comes up, or a character does something moronic.

One thing needs to be said right away though...if you're hoping for a faithful adaptation of the original 1953 classic movie, do NOT watch this. But then again I'm merely stating the obvious. This is an adaptation made in 2005 starring Paris Hilton. If you expected it to follow a similar format to the original then you only have yourself to blame if you didn't like it. Actors of the caliber of Vincent Price you will not see here. But that doesn't make this adaptation bad. Just modern, with the typical Hollywood blueprint for this type of movie. Take it or leave it.While the acting, direction and script were rather cliche, I found myself enjoying the overall atmosphere of this movie not to mention the cool special effects. The wax figures were nicely done, and some scenes were genuinely scary if somewhat predictable.

The pretty actors are soon running for dear life with the crazed maniacs in hot pursuit.Despite receiving harsh reviews, horror film fans may find ""House of Wax (2005)"" hugely entertaining. The story is pretty routine but this nasty little horror flick does offer some R-rated kills and spills that may please those undiscriminating gore hounds. And for those Paris Hilton haters out there, you may get a kick in watching the stiff-acting heiress get pursued and brutally impaled by one of the vicious killers.For those who love the original and are deciding to give this film a try, my advice to you is do not go into this expecting a Xerox of the original horror classic. The Vincent Price film was suspenseful and hugely imaginative and for many, like myself, it remains a horror masterpiece. The 2005 version is an ""in-name"" only remake which pales in comparison.  Also, do not expect Oscar-caliber acting, script-writing and production values. This is a ""by the numbers"" horror film and its sole purpose is to entertain those who like this kind of morbid unpleasantness. It's a slasher film, nothing more and like the previous slasher films that preceded it, it lacks suspense, imagination and logic. With that said, you do get an attractive cast, lots of gore, a few genuinely intense scenes, a stylish setting and lots of screaming. The films climax is also pretty spectacular though far-fetched but then again, I'm not committing 113 minutes of my life to this for realism and logic.

There is loud music every so often, horny teens, and a wannabe tough street-type guy, and a generally creepy family (brothers) in a generally creepy town. At any rate, the two movies are a separate as you can get, so you won't have much of a chance to confuse them.If there is one thing to compliment this movie on, it's those momentary points of lurking suspense. We don't see the truly evil characters for awhile, so there is at least an attempt at build up. There is an attempt at trying to introduce us to the background of the two brothers, but it really is an empty explanation. They just show a family trying to get a  rambunctious child to eat his food, and an overly aggressive father yelling. Then they flash forward, as if this explains everything.The movie seemingly begins to melt (no pun intended) before your eyes at certain points, despite its efforts to scare and thrill. I think a lot of it had to do with the seriously ridiculous plot and inane motives of the characters.The teens, who decide they want to go on a road trip to make it to the football game (it is a really important game, but we never know who is playing), of course don't make it in time and decide to spend the night in the creepiest place they can possibly find. Then, once there, they decide to hang out and party until some guy in a truck comes by and flashes his lights (he never gets out though, so we don't know who or what he is). Rather than suspecting that this guy might be some sort of serial killer out in the middle of no where, one of them decides to throw something at the truck, breaking one of the headlights and, in turn, making the possible homicidal maniac a little more upset. The truck leaves, and all appears to be fine.Fast forward to the next day....One of the guys really wants to get to the game (Why exactly everyone slept in until 2:30 in the afternoon is a question I can't answer..), but then one of the guy's cars has a broken fan belt (go figure), so they must deal with that. After accidentally slipping into a big pit with dead rotting animal flesh, which, for some reason Elisha Cuthbert's character insisted on seeing, her and her boyfriend decide to into town with some crazy derelict looking guy who makes his living apparently dumping dead animals into this pit....all in the name of a fan belt...sheesh!After the teens separate, you can use your imagination to guess what happens. The couple goes into the town to find the shop with fan belts, and, while in the process, decide to go into the spookiest place in town, the House of Wax. From there they meet another crazy guy who owns the shop, but happens to have that exact fan belt at his house. You know where this is going right? Eventually, Elisha Cuthbert's character realizes that there aren't any ""real"" people around, and that her boyfriend has been in that house just a little too long, and so chaos ensues.In the process of trying to get back to the town to get to the couple, some of the other teens meet up with the crazy brothers as well. They make the same silly mistakes that many teens make in these movies, and so, many points become a bit predictable and cumbersome to watch.I guess it could have been worse...Paris Hilton could have said something like, ""Look! Wax, that's hot.""There have been worse movies made, and definitely worse horror movies made. But, this is just another lower than average horror movie to make a few bucks for Hollywood.1  stars for an effort at suspense.

Neither of which are present in this 2005 re-make of the 1953 Vincent Price classic House of Wax, which possessed both.In this go around, six would be college students headed to a college football game encounter an eerie town and it's once time popular tourist attraction, the House of Wax (literally, the house and all its contents are made of wax). While en route to the game, our six unsuspecting collegians decide to stop and pitch camp in the woods off some deserted detour road in the middle of nowhere.The happy campers are visited by an ominous truck with its bright lights blaring in the middle of the night; however, the driver never revels himself and the truck departs before a ruckus breaks out so our merry band of revelers think nothing of the event. You can imagine their surprise when they awoke the following morning and found that one of their cars was rendered disabled while they slept. Anyways, the group splits up with two people remaining back to get the car fixed, and the other four continue onward to the game. However a series of unfortunate events place all six individuals back at Trudy's House of Wax before the night is through, and subsequently to most of their impending demise.The cast is headed by a slew of television's teen pop icons including: Elisha Cuthbert (""24""); Chad Michael Murray (""One Tree Hill""); and Paris Hilton (""The Simple Life""). However, none of them can save this highly unlikely slaughter-fest extravaganza. At least in the first film, Prof. Henry Jarrod (Price) was wronged by his partner and seriously disfigured prior to him turning into a raving lunatic.

927995,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000AM4P9K,General Zombie,"[2, 3]","I'm not gonna say too much about this film, as too much has already been said.  I suppose the title says of the review it all.  It takes most of it's cues from the new 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', but with the backwoods killers in a deserted town having a wax, rather than skin, fetish. (Even with some more specific details- the killer has a wax mask he wears, and we have a fairly extended see of him, uh, waxifying his first victim etc.)  It's nearly 2 hours long, which is totally stretching it for a slasher movie, and it takes nearly an hour to get to the first kill.  Now, this opening stuff is more entertaining than the intro to your average slasher movie, and not even boring, really, but there just isn't any need for it to go on that long.  Also, we arrive at the point where it's obvious that no more of the protagonists are going to die too early in the film. (The scenes of the people getting wasted by the killer are what we're interested in, moreso than the final confrontation)The films has got some nice set design and FX work, particularly at the very waxy, nonsensical climax.  The gore is nicely done, and fairly abundant for a major release, mainstream film. (Still, it could use  a higher bodycount)  It also doesn't shy away from the pain involved in such things, which gives it a bit more intensity.  Acting and character, eh, whaddya expect.  Elisha Cuthbert, formerly of '24', is the heroine, and she's never been much of an actor, but she's quite attractive, so it all works out alright.  (She is better than on that show, however, and I do prefer her the inevitably obnoxious 'hot young stars' that dominated the earlier slasher revival films.)  Other than that we've got Chad William Michael Thomas Frederick James Murray as her twin brother, the jerk with a heart of gold, and some dude as her huge boyfriend who is like 18 inches taller than her.  All these people are total non-entities, which is fine by me.  When it comes to slasher movies, you have the characters who make no impression, and those who are annoying.  That's about it.  No one else is worth mention, though I suppose I have to mention Paris Hilton.  As irritating as having her be in this or any movie is, her performance is passable, considering the material.  Very, very little is required for the minor role in a slasher film, and she more or less is up to the task.  Also, she has very little screen time, which is a plus.On top of just being a competently staged slasher movie with some decent gore and nice set design, it occasionally defies expectations.  Most notably, the order of deaths is probably not what you'll anticipate, the apparently dead killer does *NOT* lunge at the prematurely relieved heroes, and there's a certain injury that occurs which I would've expected would've only been threatened.All in all this is pretty decent as far as mainstream horror goes nowadays.  It's kinda nice to see a movie with a goofy premise, but which actually has the courage to play it straight, and not become a self-reflexive 'smart' horror movie.  (Which are usually dumb and obvious.)

Why not The House of Wax?) on some levels is a better film than most and in other ways far worse.First of all, I'm over 40, so I'm not really the target audience for this film...That said, I like a good horror film - this just isn't. House of Wax takes essentially the same name of the 1950's 3D horror film The House of Wax, which starred Vincent Price. The similarities end there. Whereas the original film was creepy and more than just a little bit frightening, this film is derivative and disappointing.First of all, let's talk about what is good about the film:- The acting. For a low budget horror film, the acting is leaps and bounds above those found in the original 1970's low budget horror films like Friday the 13th and The Burning. That isn't saying a lot. It just means that these kids know how to act - they won't win any awards for their acting though.- The special effects. The special effects in this film are good. I particularly liked the wax effects that were used for the actual house of wax. I also liked the whole little town that was created for the film.Sorry folks, but that's the end of the good. (Unless you consider that one of the WB's hottest hunks, peels off his wife-beater and shows of his rippled six pack - a good thing).Now, to the bad:- The script/story: Ever since Toby Hooper made his independent film, "" The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" any slasher film after that must be compared to it. This film is terribly derivative of that film. House of Wax has a group of idiotic college kids driving in a ghettoed out SUV and a older model car (TCM had an old van full of idiotic pot smoking college age kids). This film has the idiots coming across a house of wax which becomes a house of horrors, where everyone but a few die (same in Texas CM). In this there is a disfigured brother as there was in Texas CM. The remnants of the murderered are all over the town and in the House of Wax - in Texas Chainsaw, the victims skeletons and skins were everywhere in the house. in House of Wax, victims cars are all over the town as if people live there. In Texas CM, victims cars are hidden from the sky by camoflauge screens.- Now - let's look at the House of Wax itself. In this film it really IS a house of wax - a house made of wax than contains a House of Wax museum (which by the way, must have been one of the worst, since there are only about a half a dozen wax figures in it -  and they're not of anyone famous - why would anyone go to see that?). A house made of wax? Did the filmmakers (or the others on this site who thought this film cool or scary) really believe that such a thing could exist? Ever heard of the sun? It melts wax. Wax museums are very cool because they must maintain the wax effigies at a mild temperature or risk them melting. Just plain silly.- Once again, Hollywood is at the forefront of the racial relations commission - why is it now necessary for all teen movies to include interracial coupling?- The backstory explaining why the killers are doing what they're doing is trite and silly. It also doesn't actually explain why.- Finally, I'm sick to death of films that knowingly set their endings up for a sequel. When Frankenstein ended the monster was dead. Dead. No question. And yet they got some good screenwriters to make a new screenplay to bring the monster back from the dead for The Bride of Frankenstein. These filmmakers don't think the movie going audience has a brain in its head - they automatically set the film up for a sequel. To my thinking, it's Hollywood's way of saying, ""Hey we got your $9 for this film and we're going to rip you off again in a couple of months when we release the sequel to this film - so that we can build a franchise out of it.""The funny thing is - much of the target audience for this film - thinks it is good. That only means that Hollywood has successfully lowered the bar to the point that any kind of dreck can be passed off as good filmmaking and the youth of today will buy it. Apparently a bunch of pretty faces, stunt casting (Paris Hilton actually doing a wink and a nod to her infamous sexual escapades on videotape), a rehashed script, a severed head or two and the audiences will just eat it up.Wow!Don't bother.",2,Derivative Horror Film with decent acting and sets,1131321600,"11 7, 2005",2005,4304,"['House', 'Wax', 'what', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'avoidance', 'article', 'Why', 'not', 'House', 'Wax', 'levels', 'better', 'film', 'most', 'other', 'ways', 'far', 'worse.First', ""'m"", '40', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'target', 'audience', 'film', 'said', 'like', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'House', 'Wax', 'essentially', 'same', 'name', '1950', '3D', 'horror', 'film', 'House', 'Wax', 'starred', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'similarities', 'end', 'there', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'creepy', 'more', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'frightening', 'film', 'derivative', 'disappointing.First', 'let', 'talk', 'what', 'good', 'film', 'acting', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'film', 'acting', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'found', 'original', '1970', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'films', 'Friday', '13th', 'Burning', ""n't"", 'saying', 'lot', 'just', 'kids', 'know', 'how', 'act', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'acting', 'though.-', 'special', 'effects', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'are', 'good', 'particularly', 'liked', 'wax', 'effects', 'were', 'used', 'actual', 'house', 'wax', 'also', 'liked', 'whole', 'little', 'town', 'was', 'created', 'film.Sorry', 'folks', 'end', 'good', 'consider', 'one', 'WB', 'hottest', 'hunks', 'peels', 'wife-beater', 'shows', 'rippled', 'six', 'pack', 'good', 'thing', '.Now', 'bad', 'script/story', 'Ever', 'Toby', 'Hooper', 'made', 'independent', 'film', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'slasher', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'compared', 'film', 'terribly', 'derivative', 'film', 'House', 'Wax', 'group', 'idiotic', 'college', 'kids', 'driving', 'ghettoed', 'SUV', 'older', 'model', 'car', 'TCM', 'had', 'old', 'van', 'full', 'idiotic', 'pot', 'smoking', 'college', 'age', 'kids', 'film', 'idiots', 'coming', 'house', 'wax', 'house', 'horrors', 'where', 'everyone', 'few', 'die', 'same', 'Texas', 'CM', 'disfigured', 'brother', 'was', 'Texas', 'CM', 'remnants', 'murderered', 'are', 'town', 'House', 'Wax', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'victims', 'skeletons', 'skins', 'were', 'everywhere', 'house', 'House', 'Wax', 'victims', 'cars', 'are', 'town', 'people', 'live', 'there', 'Texas', 'CM', 'victims', 'cars', 'are', 'hidden', 'sky', 'camoflauge', 'screens.-', 'Now', 'let', 'look', 'House', 'Wax', 'film', 'really', 'house', 'wax', 'house', 'made', 'wax', 'House', 'Wax', 'museum', 'way', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'worst', 'are', 'only', 'half', 'dozen', 'wax', 'figures', ""'re"", 'not', 'anyone', 'famous', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'go', 'see', 'house', 'made', 'wax', 'Did', 'filmmakers', 'others', 'site', 'who', 'thought', 'film', 'cool', 'scary', 'really', 'believe', 'thing', 'could', 'exist', 'Ever', 'heard', 'sun', 'wax', 'Wax', 'museums', 'are', 'very', 'cool', 'must', 'maintain', 'wax', 'effigies', 'mild', 'temperature', 'risk', 'melting', 'Just', 'plain', 'silly.-', 'Once', 'again', 'Hollywood', 'forefront', 'racial', 'relations', 'commission', 'why', 'now', 'necessary', 'teen', 'movies', 'include', 'interracial', 'coupling', 'backstory', 'explaining', 'why', 'killers', 'are', 'doing', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'trite', 'silly', 'also', ""n't"", 'actually', 'explain', 'why.-', 'Finally', ""'m"", 'sick', 'death', 'films', 'knowingly', 'set', 'endings', 'up', 'sequel', 'When', 'Frankenstein', 'ended', 'monster', 'was', 'dead', 'Dead', 'question', 'yet', 'got', 'good', 'screenwriters', 'make', 'new', 'screenplay', 'bring', 'monster', 'back', 'dead', 'Bride', 'Frankenstein', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'going', 'audience', 'brain', 'head', 'automatically', 'set', 'film', 'up', 'sequel', 'thinking', 'Hollywood', 'way', 'saying', 'Hey', 'got', '9', 'film', ""'re"", 'going', 'rip', 'off', 'again', 'couple', 'months', 'when', 'release', 'sequel', 'film', 'so', 'can', 'build', 'franchise', 'funny', 'thing', 'much', 'target', 'audience', 'film', 'good', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'successfully', 'lowered', 'bar', 'point', 'kind', 'dreck', 'can', 'be', 'passed', 'off', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'youth', 'today', 'will', 'buy', 'Apparently', 'bunch', 'pretty', 'stunt', 'casting', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'actually', 'doing', 'wink', 'nod', 'infamous', 'sexual', 'escapades', 'videotape', 'rehashed', 'script', 'severed', 'head', 'two', 'audiences', 'will', 'just', 'eat', 'up.Wow', 'Do', ""n't"", 'bother']",N/A

The plotline concerns a bunch of teenagers on their way to somewhere, who get waylaid in a strange little town where everything is made out of wax. A more apt title for this travesty would have been Town of Wax, but then they couldn't have claimed it was a remake of an old Vincent Price classic. As it is, this movie shares nothing with the original except for the name. This was clearly just a case of Dark Castle wanting to capitalize on the success of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, so they did their best to copy it note for note, substituting Elisha Cuthbert for Jessica Biel. I think Jessica and Elisha might be wearing the exact same tank top though.Just pathetic. Even when he was alive, I don't know if anyone would have called William Castle a genius, but he was well known for coming up with cheap gimmicks to promote his movies like skeletons dropping from the ceiling of the theater at a key moment. If William Castle could see how badly Dark Castle is tarnishing his admittedly shlocky name, I think he might claw his way out of the grave and strangle the whole lot of them. Rather than taking William Castle's name and making poor remakes of his movies, Joel Silver and his happy band of idiots should have set their sites on Ed Wood. He was probably more their style. Then they could have called their company Dark Wood. You know, come to think of it, I better shut up. Knowing how these guys think, they might think that was a good idea.

You, the viewer, go along for the experience and venture into a &#34;small corner of hell&#34; on earth.I gave this movie five stars, because it's just so creative. The production design in this movie is incredible! The acting is fine, as much &#34;acting&#34; as can go along with the kind of characters that exist in this story. The writing is very good-it starts out goofy, and slowly builds, and builds and builds some more to the horrific climax. There are some funny moments thrown in for relief. A nice cameo by Bette Davis, which is just one of the pleasures of this &#34;smart&#34; thriller. FINAL NOTE: this film has some pretty gruesome moments, and may not be before the faint of heart.

The movie is ridden with cliches, especially the ending and the result is a lack so suspense and character.Ultimately, what you get in ""House of Wax"" is a slasher with a little bit of a wrinkle to it...the movie has flaws, not the least of which is that the acting is very poor, the characters are not likeable and the movie completely fails to produce any scares or horror in the audience...there is very little to zero character development and zero suspense.  That said, ""House of Wax"" is another average remake of a horror movie which is mildly entertaining at best and only to die-hard horror movie lovers.Hollywood has decided to remake every good horror movie that has ever been made, and obviously Hollywood has run out of ideas, but a word of advice to the next creator of a movie like this: please don't cast Paris Hilton as a character again because she is an absolutely atrocious actress...I mean the next thing you know they will make a remake of ""Halloween"" starring Cristina Aguilera and Brittany Spears!!The bottom line on ""House of Wax"" is that it is nothing new and definitely nothing special, but, sadly, I've seen much worse.  If you're a die-hard horror movie fan, I suggest checking it out, but I wouldn't spend $23.00 on it like I did.

Also, it's a fairly small number of people who actually get ""whacked"" --and even fewer get the full-on wax treatment, which is sort of surprising, given the title, --and sort of a relief, when you consider how cruel this movie is in its minute details.The really disappointing thing is that the movie never really succeeds in getting under your skin the way that GREAT horror movies do, because it never smartly addresses the odd, psycho-sexual reasons for THIS PARTICULAR kind of murder and mayhem.  There's a lot of standard-issue ""slasher""-style hunting and killing (sorry, but that comes under a totally different 'psycho' category -- read your textbooks, people!)  Why a house of wax?, except that it's already been done before, so the filmmakers can play it safe with a ready-made title?  I mean, it's *always* creepy to get stalked and killed by a masked, limping nutcase -- but what is it about the whole 'preserved-in-wax' thing that is creepy in the particulars?  The movie never gives a good explanation, so you keep thinking, 'what was THAT all about?'.There's lots of better scary movies out there, and there's lots worse... I just wish they'd take a little more time to discover that there's different ways to be afraid, and different reasons for it.Plus, what is with all these reviewers chortling over the death of Paris Hilton?

This was remade in l950 with the 3D version called ""House of Wax.""Now we have the 2007 version and I was really surprised at how entertaining this proved to be. But first, I had to get used to the fact that this wasn't set in a big city like the other two.  We're taken along a trip to hell when a group of young people decide to camp out in an isolated woods.Okay, this has been done a million times, and of course, this is their fatal mistake, as we've seen a million times over in other flicks. This time, though, they're right next door to a deserted village which had once been the locale for a popular wax museum.The young cast gives it their all and Chad Michael Murray (i hope I've got that right) is fantastic as the tough, macho hero. He plays the bad boy, whose always in trouble, but when it comes to surviving, he's right there and on the ball. Girls--and gay guys-should swoon when he strips off his jersey. For once, a man provides the beefcake instead of the usual bikini clad, or nude, girls.The final part, where the heroine and the hero (Chad) battle it out to escape the nightmarish house of wax revs up the excitement and thrills. On top of that, we discover that the whole house is literally made of wax, that melts at an alarming degree because of fire.If you've never seen that old pre-code classic, Mystery of the Wax Museum, you should definitely rent it. The Warner Brothers movie was filmed in a beautiful, early Technicolor process that gives the whole film an eerie, beautiful look of pastel greens, reds and blues. The cast is fantastic--the shrieking Fay Wray, the demonic Lionel Atwell as the disfigured monster, and the hysterical, wise-cracking reporter, Glenda Farrell. You're also treated to typical pre-code forbidden topics--like prostitution, drug addicts, etc. And best of all, it's directed at a furious pace by Academy Award winning Michael Curtiz--who gave us Casablanca. Also, filmed in the same year, also in early Technicolor, and using most of the same cast was the equally bizarre, Dr. X.Dr. X, along with Mystery of the Wax Museu, should definitely belong in your horror movie collection.",5,Terrific Remake!,1231718400,"01 12, 2009",2009,2377,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'so', 'disgusted', 'furious', 'latest', 'batch', 'remakes', 'horror', 'classics', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'when', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'yet', 'remake', 'great', 'old', 'classic', 'l933', 'Mystery', 'Wax', 'Museum', 'was', 'remade', 'l950', '3D', 'version', 'called', 'House', 'Wax', 'Now', 'have', '2007', 'version', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'how', 'entertaining', 'proved', 'be', 'first', 'had', 'get', 'used', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'set', 'big', 'city', 'other', 'two', ""'re"", 'taken', 'trip', 'hell', 'when', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'decide', 'camp', 'out', 'isolated', 'woods.Okay', 'been', 'done', 'million', 'times', 'course', 'fatal', 'mistake', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'million', 'times', 'other', 'flicks', 'time', 'though', ""'re"", 'right', 'next', 'door', 'deserted', 'village', 'had', 'once', 'been', 'locale', 'popular', 'wax', 'museum.The', 'young', 'cast', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'hope', ""'ve"", 'got', 'right', 'fantastic', 'tough', 'macho', 'hero', 'bad', 'boy', 'always', 'trouble', 'when', 'surviving', 'right', 'there', 'ball', 'Girls', 'gay', 'guys-should', 'swoon', 'when', 'jersey', 'once', 'man', 'beefcake', 'instead', 'usual', 'bikini', 'clad', 'nude', 'girls.The', 'final', 'part', 'where', 'heroine', 'hero', 'Chad', 'battle', 'escape', 'nightmarish', 'house', 'wax', 'revs', 'excitement', 'thrills', 'top', 'discover', 'whole', 'house', 'literally', 'made', 'wax', 'melts', 'alarming', 'degree', 'fire.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'old', 'pre-code', 'classic', 'Mystery', 'Wax', 'Museum', 'should', 'definitely', 'rent', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'beautiful', 'early', 'Technicolor', 'process', 'whole', 'film', 'eerie', 'beautiful', 'look', 'pastel', 'greens', 'reds', 'blues', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'shrieking', 'Fay', 'Wray', 'demonic', 'Lionel', 'Atwell', 'disfigured', 'monster', 'hysterical', 'wise-cracking', 'reporter', 'Glenda', 'Farrell', ""'re"", 'also', 'treated', 'typical', 'pre-code', 'forbidden', 'topics', 'prostitution', 'drug', 'addicts', 'etc', 'best', 'directed', 'furious', 'pace', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'Michael', 'Curtiz', 'who', 'gave', 'Casablanca', 'Also', 'filmed', 'same', 'year', 'also', 'early', 'Technicolor', 'using', 'most', 'same', 'cast', 'was', 'equally', 'bizarre', 'Dr.', 'X.Dr', 'X', 'Mystery', 'Wax', 'Museu', 'should', 'definitely', 'belong', 'horror', 'movie', 'collection']",N/A

It is a movie designed to make you cringe a little.I don't totally agree with the whole slasher flick synapses though.  There is a bit of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Wrong Turn, Hills Have Eyes thing here too.  There is nothing more chilling to me than a group of ""city kids"" at the mercy of backwoods folk.  This film is just another example of that chill.I don't consider this a spoiler, but what movie has been out there recently, where the movie's heroine gets her lips super-glued together and gets her pointer finger tip clipped off with wire cutters?  Yep, this film really goes out there when it comes to cruelty.  But hey, it made me cringe.And yes, I will agree with most, that this film does (once again), make 20-something kids seem like idiots.  If it wasn't for all the overzealous curiosity, and snoopiness, the story wouldn't be possible.  But hey, I'm 39 years old, and I don't mind seeing a bunch of smart *** kids biting the dust in intense ways (on film anyway).

Yet they still stay there for the night. They even still stay after a creepy truck flashes it's lights at them and then leaves. When  they wake-up one of the cars just happen to not start and the kids are still thinking ""duh what is going on ?"".  They pissed off the truck driver obviously and he did something to the car and none of them even think that. Plus they see a creepy guy throwing dead deers in a big pile and they actually get in the car with him when he offers them a ride.Then when they get to town to get the car part they need, they meet a creepy gas station worker. He says he has the part they need but that it's in his house. So they get in the car with him as well and then one of them asks if they can use the bathroom in his house. So yeah not hard to imagine what will happen from there. Still though it's fun to see what stupid mistakes they will make next. Like when a killer is after you do you keep running or hide in a car ? If you were in this movie your answer would be hide in a car lol.It's easy to pick this movie apart but it's still not that bad of a movie. A town full of nothing but wax dead people is pretty creepy. The whole look of the film is well done. Plus the acting isn't really bad either. Paris Hilton will probably be knocked a lot but she's really not that bad. There's been much much worse performances in horror movies. Also there's some inside jokes about her in there. I mean she gets video taped a lot in the movie. When of course she also likes to get video tape in real life...  Chad Michael Murray (One Tree Hill) plays a badass who's just hanging around with his sister (Elisha Cuthbert) to bug her and her b/f. He blames her for being sent to jail thinking she ratted him out.Murray plays a badass well and he's pretty nuts to charge the killers in this and try to fist fight them. I don't think anyone watching the movie would wanna fight them. Elisha Cuthbert who is used to running and screaming in 24 does a fine job...running and screaming here as well lol. I liked the Ring 2 but I had a better time at the movies seeing house of wax. It's fun, creepy and scary and had me at the edge of my seat.

928022,A3GUTAC5UVKUH,B000AM4P9K,Joe Carugati,"[3, 4]","The new ""House of Wax"" is a remake (Oh, that's right...everything is a remake these days).  It's remaking or reimagining an old Vincent Price film where Price himself would take people's bodies and cover them in wax, and then of course, they would be put on display.  I've never seen the original, so I do not know how close they are together in similarities.Critics were all over the place with this movie.  They would talk about how long and tedious the character and story setup was, how the acting itself was terrible, how brutal the gore was, how cool the ending was, and then they would change their focus to Paris Hilton and her role in the film.  After finally seeing the movie, I can kind of see eye to eye with reviewers.  I went into the film expecting a long, drawn out beginning, copious amounts of gore when it hit, bad acting, a cool ending, and Paris Hilton looking like a deer in headlights.  My expectations pretty much hit the mark...but that's not to say the movie is failure.The story is your basic run of the mill slasher type.  Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) and her recently released from jail brother, Nick (Chad Michael Murray) are heading to a big college football game somewhere (I don't remember nor did I really care).  Along the ride is Carly's boyfriend, Wade (Jared Paladecki), Blake (Robert Ri'chard), his girlfriend, Paige (Ms. Hilton), and the nerdy, typical (who of course has a camcorder and films everything) guy, Dalton (Jon Abrahams).  Anyway, the group sees a shortcut to get to the game faster, which of course leads them into trouble.  While camping, one of the fan belts on their car breaks (or did someone cut it? you take a guess).  Carly and Wade decide to go into the nearest town, learn that the townsfolk is a bit out there, find a wax museum, and see that figures in the place are very realistic and that the townspeople may not be what they seem to be.  Pretty soon, the group is being offed one by one in different gory, creative ways as they desperately try to find a way out of the town.For this movie, there are so many things that work and do not work.  So, I'm going to make a list of the good and bad, because many things do work well in this film, while others hinder it from becoming something of a classic or even an above average slasher.  First, I'll get the bad out of the way...1) The acting is pretty bad (even for a horror movie).  Elisha Cuthbert, Jared Paladecki, Robert Ri'chard, Paris Hilton, and Jon Abrahams all play stereotypical characters, but maybe they could have made something out of it (Cabin Fever did for me).  They were mainly boring to watch.  They also did the stupidest things I have ever seen.  Yes, horror movies always mean someone will go down a dark hallway and you know they're going to die.  But, I mean these people are so stupid.  For example, guy drops dead roadkill into a dump filled with rotting, decaying animals and asks you if you'd like a ride.  Well, according to our characters, that sounds like a great idea.  It's times like these where you look at the screen and just yell at it.  The only person worthy for watching the film in terms of acting is Brian Van Holt.  He plays a gas station attendant named Bo in the little town and he gives a pretty good performance.  Besides that, the acting doesn't do it for me at all.2) The setup of the film and it's characters is way too long.  It takes 45 minutes to an hour before the first body drops.  Before that, nothing really happens.  We're supposed to learn about our characters, but I never cared about them.  I was getting ancy in my seat, hoping something would just happen.3) The premise of the film is pretty darn cool.  I mean having people be slaughtered (or at least injured) and be made into a wax figure is pretty interesting and a creepy thought.  The problem with the film is basically...they don't utilize it.  I mean if I was making this film, I would have had every single person die by becoming a wax figure.  Yes, I would kill them off all differently, but still have them become wax figures.  I wanted to see all the cast members become waxed.  That would have chilled me.  One person gets waxed...that's it.  After that, people are killed in the usual way (stabbings, impalings, dismemberment).  I don't know, but when I go into a movie called ""House of Wax""...I want to see people be waxed (that means more than just one).4) The ending.  I don't mean the climactic ending.  I mean like the surprise ending (I guess that's what you call it?)  It just didn't fit with the story at all, and by the end of the movie, I didn't care about it.With the bad being aside, now the good...1) This movie is pretty brutal.  Although I stated before that I didn't think that they had enough waxings, these movie delivers the goods.  At least, we got a hard ""R"".  I'm getting sick of ""PG-13"" horror movies.  They just don't work.  Yet, when the bodies start dropping, it gets bloody and sometimes you'll be saying, ""No way...""2) The killer(s) although nothing they did would really distinguish them from others, he/she/they are pretty creepy and wacked out.3) The ending (not the surprise ending) was very well done.  You'll have to see the movie, but basically put together a huge wax museum made out of wax and a big fire taking place inside it.  You can probably see where this leads to.  Very cool.Overall, this is your average slasher movie.  You have your stereotypical characters, your bloody violence, and your same old storyline.  I recommend for a rental, but it moves to slowly at times, and fast paced horror fans are going to want to look elsewhere.Rated R for strong gory violence, disturbing images, language, and some sexual

I'm not sure what the budget was for this, but when you have a billionaire in the cast, you'd think they might have asked to borrow some. Make no mistake, do not confuse this movie with the 1953 Vincent Price classic of the same name.A group of young people are heading off to a college football game somewhere in Florida. Instead of driving on through and getting there early enough (""We can't miss this game!!!""), they camp out. And I mean camp out, instead of the night, it looks like they brough enough camping equipment for a week. They pulled over because they were tired, but they set up this huge camp, play football, and deal with a mystery pickup truck.SO of course morning comes and they sleep in. Looks like one of the fan belts got cut sometime in the night, so half the group goes to the game, while the others get a ride into a nearby down from the friendly road kill man.Of course now we have the trap set as one by one they end up in town and get offed. Well when they say 'House of Wax' they really mean it. The house and everything in it is made of wax. Can you believe it? A three story wax house that survives in the SOuth Florida sun? Also, the town is deserted except for wax figures in the church and a house here and there.Well you already know the secret I'm sure. The wax figures are real people. SO who's doing this? A pair of psychotic Siamese Twins. Yes you read that correctly. Put a KFC chicken bucket on the twin that wears the mask, and presto, you have Buckethead.The movie had very little scares or frights, unless you are a 10 year old girl.

928027,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B000AM4P9K,Joker,"[0, 0]","WARNING:  Some spoilers aheadThis movie is not an exact remake of Mystery Of The Wax Museum (1933) and its remake House Of Wax (1953). Whereas the 1933 and 1953 movies took place in a big city, this 2005 movie takes place in a very small and remote town in Louisiana. There ARE some similarities to the 1933 and 1953 flicks, but the similarities are loose at best. I have to wonder why they titled the movie House Of Wax, which is the same title as the 1953 movie. Maybe it was name recognition to get people in the door at the movie theater.To me, this movie is a cross between The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the Friday The 13th movies. Right from the beginning of the movie it had The Texas Chainsaw Massacre feel to it, then the Friday The 13th feel kicked in a short time later. Much like these movies (and so many slasher horror movies including Halloween), House Of Wax features a group of teenagers or twenty-somethings who are partying and just trying to have a good time, whether its at a campground, a neighborhood, or wherever. Then somewhere along the way they run into trouble and a killer stalks them. In this movie, six college friends have their car break down in a remote area. They had been on their way to a football game. They discover a small town when they are looking for help. On the way to this small town, two of them catch a ride with a creepy, mentally sick stranger. I have no clue why these people would trust a creepy stranger like the one in this movie, or any stranger. You gotta see him to know what I'm talking about. In town there is a museum called House Of Wax. This building is literally made of wax - the walls, floors, everything. Inside are wax mannequins. To sum up the plot, the kids run into not one but two wax sculpting killers who are twin brothers. There is lots of blood and gore. The goal of the killers is to make wax sculptures out of the captured kids (much like in the 1933 and 1953 movies). The kids try desperately to escape the museum and the town unscathed. Four of the kids are killed off. The ending is over-the-top and memorable. This movie has lots of good special effects and props.This movie stars the attractive Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton, Jared Padalecki, Jon Abrahams, and Robert Ri'Chard. The musical score by John Ottman is pretty good. There are a couple of ""current"" type of heavy rock songs in this movie that will someday date this movie.Paris Hilton has a lesser role in this movie compared to some of the other actors. In my opinion, she did a pretty good job acting. I must say I'm surprised to see the overall rating of this movie at 3 1/2 stars after 266 reviews. I thought it would be higher. After reading a lot of the lower rated reviews it is clear that a lot of people dislike Paris Hilton. It goes beyond acting ability, which some people question, while others praise it. I think a lot of it has to do with pure jealousy, unfortunately. She's young, rich, and famous. Again, she doesn't have a huge role in this movie. But she's in this movie, bottom line, and a lot of people don't like that. She probably was put in to sell movie tickets and give the movie a boost. Personally, I forget about who she is and judge her acting ability and the character she played, which I thought passed the test. In real life she comes across as a stereotypical blonde bimbo. People can't see past that. It doesn't help that in this movie she has a striptease scene that really sticks out like a sore thumb compared to what the other actors are doing. It almost felt to me like her striptease scene was put in the movie as a sort of self-promotion. Back in 2005 she was the hottest name out there and a tabloid story every day it seemed (and still pretty much is). I've read lots of reviews where people love the fact and are gleeful that she was killed off in this movie. Some of it could be because they disliked the character she played, but some of it could be just because she's Paris Hilton.This DVD comes with many extras, including a B-Roll and Bloopers Video Cast Commentary, an on location segment about the design of the House Of Wax, the visual effects, an alternate opening, a gag reel, and the theatrical trailer.If you want to see a unique and creepy horror movie thriller, then I recommend this movie. This movie is better than I thought it would be. You might agree with me. And keep an open mind when it comes to Paris Hilton.",5,A whole lotta wax,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,4456,"['WARNING', 'spoilers', 'aheadThis', 'movie', 'not', 'exact', 'remake', 'Mystery', 'Wax', 'Museum', '1933', 'remake', 'House', 'Wax', '1953', '1933', '1953', 'movies', 'took', 'place', 'big', 'city', '2005', 'movie', 'place', 'very', 'small', 'remote', 'town', 'Louisiana', 'ARE', 'similarities', '1933', '1953', 'flicks', 'similarities', 'are', 'loose', 'best', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'titled', 'movie', 'House', 'Wax', 'same', 'title', '1953', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'was', 'name', 'recognition', 'get', 'people', 'door', 'movie', 'movie', 'cross', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Friday', '13th', 'movies', 'Right', 'beginning', 'movie', 'had', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'feel', 'then', 'Friday', '13th', 'feel', 'kicked', 'short', 'time', 'later', 'Much', 'movies', 'so', 'many', 'slasher', 'horror', 'movies', 'including', 'Halloween', 'House', 'Wax', 'group', 'teenagers', 'twenty-somethings', 'who', 'are', 'partying', 'just', 'trying', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'campground', 'neighborhood', 'wherever', 'Then', 'somewhere', 'way', 'run', 'trouble', 'killer', 'movie', 'six', 'college', 'friends', 'have', 'car', 'break', 'down', 'remote', 'area', 'had', 'been', 'way', 'football', 'game', 'discover', 'small', 'town', 'when', 'are', 'looking', 'help', 'way', 'small', 'town', 'two', 'catch', 'ride', 'creepy', 'mentally', 'sick', 'stranger', 'have', 'clue', 'why', 'people', 'would', 'trust', 'creepy', 'stranger', 'one', 'movie', 'stranger', 'got', 'ta', 'see', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'town', 'museum', 'called', 'House', 'Wax', 'building', 'literally', 'made', 'wax', 'walls', 'floors', 'everything', 'Inside', 'are', 'wax', 'mannequins', 'sum', 'up', 'plot', 'kids', 'run', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'wax', 'sculpting', 'killers', 'who', 'are', 'twin', 'brothers', 'lots', 'blood', 'gore', 'goal', 'killers', 'make', 'wax', 'captured', 'kids', 'much', '1933', '1953', 'movies', 'kids', 'try', 'desperately', 'escape', 'museum', 'town', 'unscathed', 'Four', 'kids', 'are', 'killed', 'off', 'ending', 'over-the-top', 'memorable', 'movie', 'lots', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'props.This', 'movie', 'attractive', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'Brian', 'Van', 'Holt', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'Jon', 'Abrahams', 'Robert', ""Ri'Chard"", 'musical', 'score', 'John', 'Ottman', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'couple', 'current', 'type', 'heavy', 'rock', 'songs', 'movie', 'will', 'someday', 'date', 'movie.Paris', 'Hilton', 'lesser', 'role', 'movie', 'compared', 'other', 'actors', 'opinion', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'must', 'say', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'see', 'overall', 'rating', 'movie', '3', '1/2', 'stars', '266', 'reviews', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'higher', 'reading', 'lot', 'lower', 'rated', 'reviews', 'clear', 'lot', 'people', 'dislike', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'acting', 'ability', 'people', 'question', 'others', 'praise', 'think', 'lot', 'do', 'pure', 'jealousy', 'unfortunately', 'young', 'rich', 'famous', 'Again', ""n't"", 'have', 'huge', 'role', 'movie', 'movie', 'bottom', 'line', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'probably', 'was', 'put', 'sell', 'movie', 'tickets', 'give', 'movie', 'boost', 'Personally', 'forget', 'who', 'judge', 'acting', 'ability', 'character', 'played', 'thought', 'passed', 'test', 'real', 'life', 'across', 'stereotypical', 'blonde', 'bimbo', 'People', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'past', ""n't"", 'help', 'movie', 'striptease', 'scene', 'really', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'compared', 'what', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'doing', 'almost', 'felt', 'striptease', 'scene', 'was', 'put', 'movie', 'sort', 'self-promotion', 'Back', '2005', 'was', 'hottest', 'name', 'there', 'tabloid', 'story', 'day', 'seemed', 'still', 'pretty', 'much', ""'ve"", 'read', 'lots', 'reviews', 'where', 'people', 'love', 'fact', 'are', 'gleeful', 'was', 'killed', 'off', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'disliked', 'character', 'played', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'Paris', 'Hilton.This', 'DVD', 'many', 'extras', 'including', 'B-Roll', 'Bloopers', 'Video', 'Cast', 'Commentary', 'location', 'segment', 'design', 'House', 'Wax', 'visual', 'effects', 'alternate', 'opening', 'gag', 'reel', 'theatrical', 'trailer.If', 'want', 'see', 'unique', 'creepy', 'horror', 'movie', 'thriller', 'then', 'recommend', 'movie', 'movie', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'might', 'agree', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'when', 'Paris', 'Hilton']",N/A

Interesting cause they have car troubles, hitch a ride to the town of Ambrose where the only attraction is the ""House of Wax"", where the figures are so detailed they seem almost lifelike. Also the fact that the town is deserted should be a tip-off to the 6 friends, but if that wasn't enough two murderous twin brothers should make it clear enough.The friends end up going into the wax house and of course end up gradually falling into the clutches of the murderers, the best death scene of all of these was Paris Hilton getting a pipe through the head, which at this time was quite funny to see. One scene has some friends trying to get their friend out of some wax but has very bad results, in whats quite a gruesome point in the film.Its of course not a great film, but for a horror film and especially a remake of the 1953 classic starring Vincent Price, it is quite fun and enjoyable.

This movie is sort of the college frat party version but holds very true to the original.  A group of young folks on a road trip to a football game have a breakdown while camping out one night.  While the group splits up and some try to get to a nearby town for a new fan belt while the other takes the remaining vehicle to tray and get to the game.  Eventually both groups are back together.  The town is a strange one right out of an old movie.  In the town there is a place called House of Wax.  But when the house is explored two interesting things are discovered.  One is that the house itself is actually made of wax.  The other is that there are no famous people represented.But soon things turn ugly and the secret of the wax house begins to be known and lives are at stake.  Then the scope of the horror is revealed and people begin dieing.  As with any horror film the watcher is left wondering who will perish and when and how.  Fans of the original should be able to appreciate this one as well.Although this version does not have a great talent like Vincent Price, the story works well.  Paris Hilton manages to almost act in her part but the rest of the cast perform admirably.  One scene did bother me.  Apparently there is a furnace room that has a wax ceiling.  The heat of the furnace never seems to soften the wax above.  But the room is necessary to the plot.

""House of Wax"" is your stereotypical film about 6 20-somethings; Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) and her ex-con brotherNick (Chad Michael Murray, best performance in the film) as well as her boyfriend Wade. Nick's friend Dalton and Paige (Paris Hilton, actually not as horrible as I would've thought) and her boyfriend Blake. The 6 are heading to see a football game but decide to pull over for the night in the woods. Almost immediately, the weirdness kicks in. First there's a horrible smell coming from deeper in the woods and then someone in a pickup truck pulls up to them remains there for a few minutes and finally leaves. Anyway, the next day they go to leave when Wade finds the fan belt in his car is busted.In my experience, it doesn't seem to me that a fan belt would break in a parked car. Anyway, Carly & Wade wander into the nearby town (deserted) while the others head on to the game. There they find only one person in the town and a myserious House of Wax where everything is made of wax. What's strange is that the wax people seem so real. Anyway, in typical slasher film form all the kids are killed off one-by-one with only a few left alive to eventually bring a sh**ty sequel.

Bros. have been marketing her death, its a surprise turn around that many audiences ended up cheering her on for survival.speaking of the chase/death scenes, they were some of the most inventive and suspenseful i've witnessed in a while, and enjoyed each one very much.the acting in the film was absolutely fine, i couldn't fault any of them, especially Paris Hilton, i thought she was very decent and i was hoping for her the get more than a mere 25 minutes screen time in a 120 minute film, yet her chase scene made up for that, and believe me when i say Paris can act scared, (Watch the scene where she's hiding in a car from Vincent and he walks past her .... the look of terror on her face comes across as VERY real).Overall i give House of Wax maximum stars, for entertainment value and suspense and even gore ...... only criticism is i wish that during the marketing for the film, they hadn't revealed the death list and who dies and who survives, as it would have been ten times better not knowing if the character being chased was going to live or die and horrible death.can't wait for the DVD, but go see it at the Cinema while you can, it won't be the same in your own front room, yet if you do wait for the DVD, watch the film in the dark with no interruptions, trust me you wont be disappointed.",5,House of Wax (Paris' acting was good in the movie),1275264000,"05 31, 2010",2010,2116,"['recently', 'saw', 'House', 'Wax', 'must', 'say', 'i', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'it.it', 'been', 'one', 'better', 'Horror/Thriller', 'films', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'entertaining.i', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'lot', 'people', 'bashing', 'so-called', 'slow', 'start', 'character', 'development', 'up', 'Films', 'opening', '45', 'minutes.yet', 'film', 'dived', 'straight', 'deaths', 'audiences', 'critics', 'would', 'have', 'criticised', 'film', 'not', 'having', 'decent', 'characters', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'about.well', 'character', 'development', 'i', 'think', 'worked', 'amazingly', 'well.taking', 'own', 'response', 'others', 'reading', 'posts', 'message', 'board', 'lot', 'people', 'ended', 'up', 'wanting', 'characters', 'live', 'one', 'i', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'many', 'people', 'mentioning', 'being', 'Paige', 'Edwards', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'taking', 'consideration', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'have', 'been', 'marketing', 'death', 'surprise', 'turn', 'around', 'many', 'audiences', 'ended', 'up', 'cheering', 'survival.speaking', 'chase/death', 'scenes', 'were', 'most', 'inventive', 'suspenseful', 'i', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'while', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'very', 'much.the', 'acting', 'film', 'was', 'absolutely', 'fine', 'i', 'could', ""n't"", 'fault', 'especially', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'decent', 'i', 'was', 'hoping', 'get', 'more', 'mere', '25', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', '120', 'minute', 'film', 'yet', 'chase', 'scene', 'made', 'up', 'believe', 'when', 'i', 'say', 'Paris', 'can', 'act', 'scared', 'Watch', 'scene', 'where', 'hiding', 'car', 'Vincent', 'walks', 'look', 'terror', 'face', 'VERY', 'real', '.Overall', 'i', 'give', 'House', 'Wax', 'maximum', 'stars', 'entertainment', 'value', 'suspense', 'even', 'gore', 'only', 'criticism', 'i', 'wish', 'marketing', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'revealed', 'death', 'list', 'who', 'dies', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'not', 'knowing', 'character', 'being', 'chased', 'was', 'going', 'live', 'die', 'horrible', 'death.ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'DVD', 'go', 'see', 'Cinema', 'can', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'own', 'front', 'room', 'yet', 'do', 'wait', 'DVD', 'watch', 'film', 'dark', 'interruptions', 'trust', 'wont', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

Aside from Paris Hilton in the movie (gratefully she is offed, but not soon enough) it was a great thriller/slasher flick. And it is not a remake! The idea of killing people by encasing them in hot wax is not new, but that is the only thing this film has in common with the Vincent Price movie.I have to applaud the fact that the special effects weren't overdone. They didn't become the movie... they enhanced the movie. The movie sets, background music, lighting and inclusion of modern technology all were done exceptionally well.The script is most definitely original. Some have complained that it starts slow. It has to in order to build up a good story. Once this coaster reaches the top and starts its plunge, it throws in more of the story, filling in gaps and questions along the way.I don't want to get too involved with retelling of this story. But I will say that this movie is worth the watch. It has the right balance of suspense, fright, paranoia, claustraphobia, and chills. It doesn't dwell too long in any area. The acting, sets, music all done well. There's a strong and original story. There's very little gratiuty here, thank god. And just the right amount of special effects.So, if you're looking for a quality slasher flick that takes itself, and scaring you, seriously then this is the one for you. At least rent it. Who knows?

928043,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000AM4P9K,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 3]","""House Of Wax"" really sets the viewer up very well.  You go into it thinking that it will be another run-of-the-mill slasher flick with oversexed kids and bad acting.  Heck, it even tosses Paris Hilton into the fray to really throw you off.  Instead, you get an above-average thriller that really isn't that bad.The cast is relatively unknown unless you watch the WB or UPN or have a good eye for supporting actors.  Elisha Cuthbert and Paris Hilton are really the only recognizable actors in the flick, and unless you count her home video, Hilton isn't known for her acting skills.  With that said, however, Hilton did surprise me a bit.  I actually had a few feelings for her character and hated to see her make her exit.The story is pretty far-fetched.  You have to suspend disbelief fairly well to believe that there is a literal house of wax.  You also have to believe that an entire town can simply vanish off the map with no one seemingly recalling its existence.  Everything revolves around twin  brothers, Bo and Vincent.  They've taken a liking to to their mom's trade of making wax creations, and go to great lengths to make their own ""art.""The film has a ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" feel to it(both the original and the Jessica Biel remake).  I think it is due to the fact that the villains use plenty of medical hardware and plenty of knives to do their dirty work.  Also, one of the brothers lumbers around with a mask ala ""Leatherface"" but it's made of wax instead of human skin.  Not to mention that the villains are relentless in their pursuit of victims and there are quite a few heavily suspenseful moments.The conclusion is a tad bit much to swallow, but it does give the story closure AND manages to leave it wide open for a second ""House of Wax"" flick.The special effects were done quite well.  In fact, it was refreshing to see tons of actual wax used in this film instead of non-stop CGI.  The CGI does get in the way in one particular spot, but the rest of the effects are done so well that I'll let it slide.  The gore factor is high, and there's plenty of sadistic behavior dealt out, but it all holds up very well on the screen.In closing, this film is perfect for fans of thrillers with plenty of gore, a few suspenseful moments, and an out-there ending.  The ending isn't quite up to par with the rest of the flick, but I'd suggest this DVD to be a purchase for fans of such fare.",4,"It Melts Off A Bit In The End, But It's Still Pretty Good",1143849600,"04 1, 2006",2006,2408,"['House', 'Wax', 'really', 'viewer', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'go', 'thinking', 'will', 'be', 'run-of-the-mill', 'slasher', 'flick', 'oversexed', 'kids', 'bad', 'acting', 'Heck', 'even', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'fray', 'really', 'throw', 'off', 'Instead', 'get', 'above-average', 'thriller', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad.The', 'cast', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'watch', 'WB', 'UPN', 'have', 'good', 'eye', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'recognizable', 'actors', 'flick', 'count', 'home', 'video', 'Hilton', ""n't"", 'known', 'acting', 'skills', 'said', 'however', 'Hilton', 'did', 'surprise', 'bit', 'actually', 'had', 'few', 'feelings', 'character', 'hated', 'see', 'make', 'exit.The', 'story', 'pretty', 'far-fetched', 'have', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'fairly', 'well', 'believe', 'literal', 'house', 'wax', 'also', 'have', 'believe', 'entire', 'town', 'can', 'simply', 'vanish', 'off', 'map', 'one', 'seemingly', 'recalling', 'existence', 'Everything', 'revolves', 'twin', 'brothers', 'Bo', 'Vincent', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'liking', 'mom', 'trade', 'making', 'wax', 'creations', 'go', 'great', 'lengths', 'make', 'own', 'art', 'film', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'feel', 'original', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'remake', 'think', 'due', 'fact', 'villains', 'use', 'plenty', 'medical', 'hardware', 'plenty', 'knives', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'Also', 'one', 'brothers', 'lumbers', 'mask', 'Leatherface', 'made', 'wax', 'instead', 'human', 'skin', 'Not', 'mention', 'villains', 'are', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'victims', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'heavily', 'suspenseful', 'moments.The', 'conclusion', 'tad', 'bit', 'much', 'swallow', 'give', 'story', 'closure', 'manages', 'leave', 'wide', 'open', 'second', 'House', 'Wax', 'flick.The', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'fact', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'tons', 'actual', 'wax', 'used', 'film', 'instead', 'non-stop', 'CGI', 'CGI', 'get', 'way', 'one', 'particular', 'spot', 'rest', 'effects', 'are', 'done', 'so', 'well', ""'ll"", 'let', 'slide', 'gore', 'factor', 'high', 'plenty', 'sadistic', 'behavior', 'dealt', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'screen.In', 'closing', 'film', 'perfect', 'fans', 'thrillers', 'plenty', 'gore', 'few', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'out-there', 'ending', 'ending', ""n't"", 'quite', 'up', 'par', 'rest', 'flick', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'DVD', 'be', 'purchase', 'fans', 'such', 'fare']",N/A

928045,A1E85KPLPYVW8E,B000AM4P9K,"Kolors ""Jimmy""","[4, 6]","First off, I really have a hard time seeing why people wouldn't like this movie. If you like horror movies and went to any horror movie that came out in 2004 (with an exception of maybe one), this movie should be a sigh of relief. An R rating and a lot of blood, torture, awesome killing sequences and jumpy scenes shows  that someone still remembers how movies of this genre should be made. For a while there, I seriously thought I was doomed to having a plethora of PG-13 scary movies about ghosts go to theaters and every other horror movie that features gore and violence to go straight to video.  House of Wax thankfully proves me wrong (The Amityville Horror helped, being a decent horror flick). House of Wax proves to be a back to the basics horror flick. Following in the footsteps of movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Wrong Turn, it is about a bunch of teens who get off the main road and into a lot of trouble when they meet the locals of a backcountry deserted hick town. There's nothing more I need to tell you, as you should just go see it yourself. But that's basically what happens.Aside from all the blood and the tremendous amount of physical pain the characters endure, I thought the film was very well shot, and the cinematography just fit the film extremely well. It gave almost gave it an old feel to it, while preserving its horror movie style.  And I really enjoyed the climax, I thought it was very original and not anything I've really seen before. Very enjoyable. I wish I could tell you more but I wouldn't want to ruin it for you.So all in all, I had a lot of fun at House of Wax. I've always loved slasher flicks and I recommend anyone who feels the same way to see House of Wax.

928048,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000AM4P9K,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","Wow.  Do the kids in this movie really want to die.  There are six college students traveling in two cars to a football game and they decide to spend the night in a field near a small town in the middle of nowhere.  When a pickup truck shows up and the driver refuses to turn off the lights, get out of the truck, or say anything, one of the kids breaks a headlight and the pickup backs away.  So, do the kids pack up and run away?  No, they do not.  They go to sleep.  But, hey, why not?  What is the worst thing that can happen to you in the middle of the night if you are sleeping in tents in the middle of a field after you tick off one of the locals?Actually, the answer to that is not much relatively speaking, given that this is the opening act of this 2005 splatter flick.  If you think that Nick Jones (Chad Michael Murray) has a death wish that is nothing compared to Wade (Jared Padalecki), who establishes what could be a record for going into the wrong places in a horror movie.  The only other contender for that crown would be the last pair left alive in the film, one of whom is obviously going to be Elisha Cuthbert's Carly Jones, sister to Nick and girl friend to Wade.  This is not just because her name appears first in the credits but also because she is clearly privileged in the film's opening as the character most likely to still be alive by the end credits (plus she knows that you are only limited to three strikes when it comes to baseball or felony convictions).  The other potential young corpses in the group are Paige Edwards (Paris Hilton, who obviously has great potential in this regard) and her boyfriend, Blake (Robert Ri'chard), and Dalton Chapman (Jon Abrahams), who is so goofy that you know if he dies it is going to be either really gross or a big fake out.""House of Wax"" is an amusement ride as much as it is a movie.  These characters are so blatantly stupid that it suddenly dawns on you this is part of the ride.  Not only do we become convinced that they want to die on the subconscious level being mined by screenwriters Chad and Carey Hayes, but that they actually SHOULD die because they have entered the land of people too stupid to live.  We are not supposed to be sympathizing with this bunch; we are supposed to watch them die because you have never seen a horror film where the victims persisted in going where they should not go.  ""House of Wax"" is not a film built on suspense, but how can it be when we know before the film starts that there are dead bodies covered in wax involved?  There are a few minor ""boo"" moments in first-time director Jaume Collet-Serra's film, but what you will find more of are gross outs.  The point here is not to make you jump, but rather to make you squirm (or worse).  There are a lot of horror movies released on DVD in October and I have taken to watching them late at night in the dark, and this is the only one I have seen this month that made me wonder if I was going to have a hard time sleeping.  Collet-Serra knows how to push buttons and this is a film that convinces you there are worst things than dying.The screenwriting credits acknowledge the ""story"" by Charles Belden,"" which would be the play that was turned into the 1933 film ""Mystery of the Wax Museum,"" which became the 1953 Vincent Price 3-D version of ""House of Wax.""  The commonalities between this splatter flick and the others are more in terms of generic elements than plot.  If you have corpses covered in wax you have to have tableaus of wax figures and you have to have scenes where the wax (a) crumbles away, (b) breaks away, and (c) melts away.  These are all present and accounted for, but the piece de resistance here is that the House of Wax is literally made of wax.  Again, this is a ride as much as a movie, and if you want to start asking questions about where all the wax came from, how power bills get paid, or anything else that deals with real world logic, you are clearly in the wrong state of mind to enjoy this film.  If you hate splatter flicks with stupid victims then avoid this film like the plaque, because ""House of Wax"" embraces their stupidity and takes it over the top.  Otherwise, just go along for the ride.As for Paris Hilton's role in this film, I readily admit that my immediate reason for ever wanting to see ""House of Wax"" when I first saw the trailer was to watch her character die (I will go see ""Saw II"" tomorrow hoping for a similar cathartic experience with regards to Beverly Mitchell because Lucy Camden Kinkirk totally drives me up the wall), and I suspect I was not alone in anticipating such a scene (remember the ""On May 6th, Watch Paris Die"" t-shirts she was selling?).  On that score ""House of Wax"" delivers in yet another scene clearly calculated to send a theater audience into paroxysms of glee.  Beyond that I do not think there is anything wrong with Paris Hilton as an actress.  It is her lack of bone fides in more mundane aspects of existence that leave me cold.",4,A splatter flick that embraces the idea that stupidity SHOULD get you killed,1130371200,"10 27,

Our hapless group of older teens winds up in a small town (which looks so much like a Hollywood back lot, you hope the gore is more interesting).One by one they get waxed, pole-axed, chased, smacked and dismembered while each one discovers that everyone (almost everyone) in the town is a waxed dead person. The final showdown between the bad brother/good sister and the two evil wax makers goes for clever fight scenes and scary moments. Its no secret that the whole house is made of wax and when it starts melting, well, the effects get good. The ending has a nice little twist, but most horror flicks need one.

928064,A30SEFSHDK5RX,B000AM4P9K,Matthew C. Lupoli,"[1, 2]","PLOT: The film begins in 1974. A woman is melting wax to put onto some sort of a face mask. She starts saying some nice things to a little boy eating Cheerios while sitting in a high chair. Suddenly her husband comes into the kitchen with another boy kicking and screaming. He restrains the child in a high chair with leather wrist restraints. The screaming child kicks the table and causes the wax mask to fall and break. The mother asks the child why he can't behave like his brother and then smacks him across the face. The film then jumps to 2005. A group of college age friends are on a road trip to see a college football game in Louisiana. The group consists of Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert), her brother Nick Jones (Chad Michael Murray), Carly's boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki), Dalton Chapman (Jon Abrahams), Blake (Robert Ri'Chard), and Blake's girlfriend Paige Edwards (Paris Hilton). One night the group stops at a camp site and they begin to notice a horrible smell coming from somewhere in the surrounding woods. A mysterious truck later appears and one of the boys throws a beer bottle at it, smashing one of the headlights. The truck then proceeds to drive away. The next morning, the group suspect that one of their cars may have been tampered with during the night because the fan belt is broken. Carly explores the surrounding woods and accidentally falls into a pit of deer carcasses. The rest of the group rescue her. This pit is the source of the foul stench that they smelled during the night. Suddenly a truck pulls up to the sight and empties more deer carcasses into the pit. The driver is a creepy redneck guy (Damon Herriman) who collects and dumps roadkill for a living. The group notice a human arm sticking out of the pit, but the roadkill driver pulls it out and reveals it to be a mannequin's arm. The driver offers to give Carly and Wade a ride into the nearby town of Ambrose so they can get a new fan belt for their car. They accept the offer and the rest of the group get in the other vehicle and drive away with hopes of getting to the football game on time. The driver drop off Carly and Wade at the town's edge. All of the businesses seem to be closed and the streets are deserted. Carly and Wade go to the town church and accidentally interrupt a funeral service. They leave and a man named Bo (Brain Van Holt) comes out of the church and reprimands them for their intrusion. The couple apologize and Bo tells them that he is the gas station worker and that he will help them in a half hour. While waiting, Carly and Wade start exploring the small town and they are drawn to Trudy's House of Wax. They notice that the building itself is made of wax. They go inside and see that it is filled with amazingly life-like figures, but they are all figures of unfamiliar people rather than celebrities or historical figures. Carly notices that all the pieces of wax-work are signed by someone named ""Vincent."" She then notices in a mirror hanging on the wall that someone was spying on them through the window. The couple soon find out that something is seriously wrong in the town of Ambrose.COMMENTS: Being a huge fan of the 1953 Vincent Price classic, I had to give this remake a gander. Aside from the title, this film basically has nothing to do with the 1953 film or the original 1933 film Mystery Of The Wax Museum. The filmmakers basically took the essence of the original storyline and combined it with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974). The killer is very much a copy of Leatherface except with a mask made of wax instead of human skin; I guess we can refer to him as Waxface. It seems to me that Waxface has a strong physical resemblence to Dream Theater lead singer James LaBrie. The acting of the film is typical slasher horror acting; i.e. the damsel in distress is running up the stairs instead of running out the door, etc. There is nothing original about this film at all. If you like slasher films then this is the film for you. It has it all: extreme gore, bad acting, rednecks, extreme gore, gratuitous sexual content, cheap surprises, did I mention extreme gore. The only thing it doesn't have is gratuitous nudity; sorry guys. I'd have to say that the best thing about this film is the gorgeous Elisha Cuthbert of The Girl Next Door fame; that and Paris Hilton getting a sharp metal spike thrown through her head. I laughed like hell when I saw that scene. This DVD features the film in the original theatrical widescreen format. It also contains B-roll and bloopers video cast commentary, a few behind-the-scenes documentaries, an altermate opening, gag reel, and the theatrical trailer",4,Prey. Slay.

Even though there was already a Wax movie (made over 50 years ago) this movie was still very entertaining. It had enough gore and twistedness to make it interesting. Even though I like horror movies, some parts of this movie were hard for me to look at (a good mark of a horror movie)I didn't understand why the wax couldn't simply have peeled off Wade's skin instead of taking his skin along with it. Poor guy, he deserved better.There were a few things about the movie that just didn't work. The scene where Paris Hilton was stripping for her boyfriend went on too long - it was clearly fanservice so boys could ogle her - but she did a decent job trying to fight Vincent off. I found the idea of a literal house of wax to be silly. Over time the floors would sag, the walls would bow, etc. (that's a lot of wax!)

(Bearing in mind he has a lot of rubbish in his collection!) There was no danger that another stalk-and-slash movie was going to cheer me up, but I thought why not, and put it on to watch. I didn't go into this film expecting much, and I didn't get much in return. It's just your average stalk-and-slash movie.Why so many reviewers are slagging Paris Hilton's acting is unknown. Why?! She is not as bad as an actress as everyone is making out she is. Considering the people she was acting alongside, she was the best out of all of them. Lets look at the contenders shall we? Elisha Cuthbert I can't really comment on, since I've previously only seen her in The Girl Next Door, but I didn't recognise her at first, the hairstyle/colour makes her look positively frumpy, and not the blonde bombshell like she normally plays. Maybe she's trying to move away from that, but this was a bad move. And then there's the gorgeous Chad Michael Murray, who I wouldn't kick out of bed, but only if he keeps his eyes shut. The guy cannot act!!! He's in stuff for his looks, and his looks alone, as he only has one facial expression. And that's it. One. The rest of the cast were a bunch of unknowns. Can't really say much about them.House Of Wax was an average movie, the deaths were really nothing new, although I liked the way Paris died. (By the way, was it just me, or were there a lot of injokes to Paris' infamous video, and her catchphrase ""That's hot""? They say it quite a lot!) There's nothing new or unique about this movie that makes it stand from all the others, and I didn't really get scared, although the bad guy did freak me out. Which made me have nightmares about it! I literally could not go back to sleep at 2am, cos I thought the bad guy was in my room! And I was all on my lonesome too, no one to reassure me it was okay ... :( I haven't felt like that in years! He did kinda remind me of the girl from The Ring, with the long greasy hair.I really didn't think the casting people did well when they decided to pair Chad Michael Murray & Elisha Cuthbert's characters as twins. Especially since they did the usual stereotyped good twin/bad twin storyline. Done to death.Will there be a sequel to this? As always to these slasher movies, there's normally a twist right at the very end, and it's the same with the House Of Wax. You get a shock right at the very end, although I have to say, I had my suspicions.Don't see this film if you purely want to hate Paris. She's just playing herself in this isn't she? And she's not that bad an actress. I'm just glad I didn't waste the money buying this, as it's not particularly memorable (it's really slow to get going!) and will never rise above all the others.

True, it is kinda considered ""cliche"" with it's ""horny teens stranded with a psychotic killer on the loose,"" but this one flows more fluently than Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Amityville Horror.Rather than getting high and going to a concert, these teens are going to a football game. Also gone is the horrific survivor of the previous murders and is replaced with a chance to camp out in the wide open spaces before the big game.The characters are rather interesting as well: the aspiring somebody (Elisha Cutbert), her jock boyfriend (Jared Paladecki) who constantly tries to get along with her rebellious ""screw the world"" brother (Chad Michael-Murray), and lets not forget the typical overly horny friend of the hero (Paris Hilton). Oh yeah, and let's not forget her boyfriend who is obsessively compulsed over his ""pimpin' Escalade."" Did Cousin Skeeter buy that for him?Anyway, a typical hang out session and beer drinking turns sour with the appearance of an unwanted guest. These events and Elisha diving head first into animal carcass all leads to the main scene - the House of Wax. Similar to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it is apparent that the humanly disfigures of our killer drive them to kill - and attempt to receive sympathy. Anyway, one by one the teens are being impaled and knocked off one by one leading up to the one big ""melting pot"" of an ending.If there any complaints in this movie, it would be the fact that this man lives on turning his killings into wax (that's a given). So why is it that he ruthlessly killed two victims in particular, they lay in the back of his pick up truck? Creativity runs through our killer's mind yet he misses his opportunity.But most of all, the biggest complaint is Chad Michael-Murray. Yes, he is known as ""WB's badass"" from Gilmore Girls and One Tree Hill, but his background serves no purpose for the movie whatsoever. He blames his sister for him getting caught stealing a car and his managers for losing his job. So in the movie Murray is practically granted the gift of immortality, as he walks out of there without minor bruises and a stabbed leg while his sister gets her finger chopped off with plyers and her mouth super glued shut. I guess the WB didn't want their precious boy hurt. And it also seems odd that he cannot show any compassion for his sister when she confronts him earlier in the movie, but when he sees his friend, he sheds a tear or two. Chad, you missed your cue there, buddy!Anyway, with those minor flaws House of Wax is still a movie worth repeating. Skeptics may say this movie was lame because it did not break any new grounds, but it wasn't meant to.

This update merely borrows the basic premise and copies the numerous teen slasher flicks that preceded it.  While it does thus with style and conjures up some suspenseful moments, HOUSE OF WAX suffers from the curse of predictability.  There's not one occurrence in this film that you can't see coming.  While I appreciated the novelty of having the house itself constructed in wax, one has to ask, how in the world could anyone build such a huge structure out of wax?  What happens when it gets hot???  The cast does moderately well, with Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray effective in their heroic roles; Brian van Holt with black hair (he's usually blonde) ends up looking like Bill Paxton's demented brother and he doesn't go over the top enough to be a truly horrific villian, although he is certainly sadistic enough, and as for Paris Hilton, well what can one say?  She's no worse than countless other bimbos in these kind of films.  It's only her notoriety that brings her any attention at all; her demise is deliciously over the top, though.

Many who saw it based on the trailer feel cheated. The trailer makes this movie look very promising, which is what trailers are supposed to do. There is only one thing for sure with trailers, if the producers can't cobble together a minute of interesting elements to make a trailer, it is a pretty much a sure thing that the movie is a major suck-fest. But a good trailer only tells you that a few things about the movie are good, it does not give you much idea about the total package. Here a little research can be valuable.""House of Wax"" stars Elisha Cuthbert (whose acting skills are closer to Kathy Ireland than to either her fellow Canadian Sarah Polley or her lookalike Rose McGowen), and was directed by a music video artist formerly known as Jaume, in his feature debut. These are not good signs but if you are like me you ignore them and go to see the work of Production Designer Grace Walken, who was responsible for the look of ""Ghost Ship"". Once again Walken's work is worth seeing, so much so that it looks like 90% of the movie's $30 million budget went to production design. The rest went to Cuthbert to compensate her for the abuse she has to take throughout the film (finger cut off, lips glued shut, tied up, and lots of wading around in assorted gooey stuff). By-the-bye, Cuthbert looks considerably heavier than she did in ""The Girl Next Door"", about one big pig-out away from having a major weight problem.Which means they had nothing left over to pay the rest of the cast and crew. And judging from the what was on the screen, this might actually be true. It looks like everyone else donated their time to get their first acting or crew credit. Unfortunately, whether it was inexperience or jealousy over the pay disparity, the contributions of all these inexperienced/incompetent volunteers amount to less than zero.Inexperienced Steven Window's DP work was about as awful as you are likely to see and working in league with incompetent editor Joel Negran (insert ""Pearl Harbor"" here) they manage to take away most of the value added by the production design group. Rather than linger over and showcase the sets, Window filmed this stuff with bad lighting and jerky-zooming-bobbing camera work. Negran compounded the problem with an insane number of disorienting cuts. Poor lighting, an ADD-like camera, and flurry cutting are what you use to hide cheap and crappy production design; not what is needed when the movie's only strength is its expensive and detailed sets.Chan Hayes did the screenplay and Charles Belden (who wrote the original story) is credited as the writer although except for the title and the use of wax figures there is absolutely no similarity. One saving grace is that the movie does not take itself seriously as a horror film and is mostly parody (insert ""Van Helsing"" here). The murders are played for laughs, too extreme to be scary or even creepy to anyone over age six. The audience particularly cracked up when a certain high profile hotel heiress got her homely face run through by an steel bar, although her earlier half-baked striptease was the only genuinely creepy thing in the film. Another comedy highlight was when Cuthbert sticks her finger through a grate and has it clipped off by the bad guy.The good scenes take place in Trudy's House of Wax, a waxworks that has something to do with a closed sugar mill, conjoined twins, and a lot of roadkill (which Cuthbert gets to bathe in). All this is supposed to be happening somewhere in rural Florida although from the many hills it sure looks like southern California (attention location scouts-the gulf coast is not noted for it's rolling terrain). The screenplay apparently intended to play up the connection (bad pun) between the two sets of twins, but somewhere during production or post-production most of the dialogue concerning this was trimmed. Since what is left about the twin connection makes no sense and goes nowhere, you wonder why it wasn't also cut to reduce the boredom factor.What is particularly sad is that the producers did not have the brains to recognize in mid-production that they had the ingredients for a first rate horror classic-even with the existing cast. What was staring them in the face was a chance to go somewhere with the illusion of a town of wax. Because it is a photographic medium, modern film is intrinsically naturalistic, almost without exception prone to creating an illusion of reality. Here they had a ready-made opportunity to give the photographic medium a theatrical element of extreme stylization. Like an impressionist painting, the town creates the illusion of reality from a distance but reveals itself as a highly stylized wax fabrication up close. Of course they would have had to find a visionary Director and DP to bring the thing off successfully, but everything else was already in place for this to happen.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",3,Played For Laughs but Better in the Widescreen Version,1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,5018,"['extreme', 'comments', 'House', 'Wax', 'way', 'either', 'great', 'totally', 'awful',

I thought ""well, here we go again for another stupid slasher with nothing new to offer"".But I was wrong. In fact I found this film to be a terrific new entry into the slasher genre.The screenplay is very nice. I does not start to kill people right away.. it develops the story... lets you know ter characters... and THEN... just when you are dying to see some killings... it starts....And never lets go. The plot is better than you'd expect. Not the usual ""six kids get to a wax museum"". Instead they get separated in three groups (which opens the space for three almost-independent storylines). This may not look much... but in fact it allows the screenplay to build some plausability and complications. The characters come and go separate ways and the script creates great shock moments exactly at the moment different storylines meet.And the killings... they are brutal, sadistic... and go beyond the usual ""slash-and-you're-dead""... In fact (laughs) nobody dies at first. The screenplay takes the detail up to the limit. All the killings are beautifully constructed.Without wanting to spoil the fun, I just should say this film goes further on the sadistic things the killers do. Much further than what was acceptable years ago.I think this film brought new breath to the genre.Casting is good, makeup is fine. Directing is solid, art direction is discreet enough... I really liked it.Of course there are better films made 20 or 30 years ago. But this one sits along the best slashers in the last 10 years (if it is not THE best one in 10 years).But beware! This film is very cruel! Maybe you would like to pass on it if you play the piano, if you love your fingers... or if you like to walk barefooted.By the way... It has nothing to do with the 1953 Vincent Price version... just the title and what it suggests.Obviously, this DVD is a great buy. Watch it alone... or with friends... with 2 tons of popcorn.

The direction is terrible.  A group of teens fall prey to murderous siamese twins running a wax museum, in this remake of sorts. But it is impossible to care about any of the characters.Elisha Cuthbert and the teen idol playing her twin brother, actually look like they want to get it on.  The film explores the whole good twin/bad twin theme also in the two wax artists who create a town of wax encased victims.  What is idiotic, is that both of the wax museum brothers are about equally bad.  At the end, a teen pleads with 'the good twin', and the actor seems more confused than anything, as obviously both twins are brain dead, gruesome murderers.There was a good script possible here.  Say the disfigured siamese twin is really trying to save these losers,  while the 'normal' twin is the real killer of the house of wax maybe.

The house made all of wax with slamming doors and buncha other things don't make sense, but that stretch of reality is characteristic of most horror and SF movies. Those things are acceptable. Visual effects are well made. A highly predictable plot would normally kill a horror flick, and so exaggerated graphic gruesomeness is supposed to keep up the suspense level.Many reviewers jumped at Paris Hilton. I personally admire the fact that she WORKED when acting for this film. And WORK is what she admittedly hasn't done much of in her short life.

I tell you what they had some of them moving they had them hidden away in the dark you turn around and BAM theres one right behind you. So you know their wax but I don't know those things are freaky especially when they look like the real person. So if they told me that was a hunted house I would have believed them I was shook and dont like them much more now that I am 25.I like the old cheesy house of wax from back in the day. That was what I was expeceting more or less with this one. But of course 100 years after the original this modern day wax movie would be a little more extreme.Excellent movie !! Those people got tortured. There are many parts in this movie where I was actually uncomfortable and there is plenty of suspense and brutality. The guys get the girls get it no remorse.

928098,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000AM4P9K,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 7]","House of Wax (Jaume Collet-Serra, 2005)I had assumed this movie would suck simply because it was a Paris Hilton vehicle. (And it really was a Paris Hilton vehicle; the cast was built around Hilton.) Then I rented it, and the first thing I see is the ""Dark Castle Entertainment"" logo. I thought they'd gotten away from doing horrible remakes. Not so, I guess.Collet-Serra's feature film debut follows the Dark Castle formula closely: gather a bunch of young-and-beautifuls, make them act far below their average standard, and blow most of the special effects budget on one really cool effect that people will be talking about incessantly.In this case, the young-and-beautifuls number six. There are Wade (Gilmore Girls' Jared Padalecki) and his girlfriend Carly (24 star Elisha Cuthbert), who are on the rocks. Carly's in-and-out-of-jail twin brother Nick (One Tree Hill's Chad Michael Murray). Nick's best friend Blake (Robert Ri'chard, last seen in Coach Carter) and his girlfriend Paige (Paris Hilton). And then there's Dalton (Boston Public's Jon Abraham), tagging along for the ride, the annoying kid with the video camera who seems de rigeur in every action thriller since Trespass twelve years ago. They are on their way to a big football game when a shortcut ends up under construction and they have to find a place to camp. They do so about fifteen miles from a small town called Ambrose (which, while judging by the surrounding dialogue would seem to be in Louisiana, sports inhabitants with a marked lack of southern accents). The six of them have a strange run-in with a mysterious pickup truck, go to sleep (without, it should be noted, posting a watch), and wake up to find the fan belt on Wade's car has broken. Wade and Carly stay behind to go into Ambrose and get a new fan belt, while the others continue on to the game. Once in Ambrose, Wade and Carly meet Bo (Threshold's Brian van Holt), the owner of the local gas station, who doesn't have a fan belt at the station, but there might be one in the delivery up at the house...To give you a plot summary that doesn't get to spoilerville would take well beyond a thousand words itself. Its odd how, when everything in a movie is so completely trivial, it all seems to reach the same level of unimportance, eventually. (I will tell you this, though: Paris Hilton dies on page 596.)House of Wax suffers from the same problems as, well, every one of Dark Castle's other flicks to date. The young-and-beautifuls are recruited, mostly, from TV primetime soap operas, and therefore are used to the kind of overemoting that Dark Castle's higher-ups seem to find an acceptable substitute for actual acting. (It should be noted, however, that when he's not being overly dramatic, the best performance in the film by a country mile is turned in by Murray; the only other performance in the film even close is that of Lester [Son of the Mask and They's Damon Harriman], whose part is small, but effective.) The script is threadbare to say the least, having thoroughly jettisoned everything about the original House of Wax and replaced it with a kind of Texas Chainsaw Massacre vibe that might actually be halfway effective if, well, someone hadn't already remade Texas Chainsaw Massacre last year. And done it a whole lot better than this.Its strengths are fewer, but again, they cling to the Dark Castle mold. The everpresent ""one really cool special effect"" really is cool; the house of wax is completely made of wax. Which leads to all sorts of nifty melting stuff. You've all seen the ""guy running with path crumbling behind him"" thing before? Yeah, but they do it in a kind of novel way here. And, like all Dark Castle films, the movie is inherently watchable, partly because it's so bad that you want to see what happens next, partly because Dark Castle's writing stable seems to have been culled from the ranks of soap opera writers; they know what to do, and how to do it badly. Also-- and this did come as a pleasant surprise-- Dark Castle broke the ""seeing the monster too much"" mold here. The monster gets so little exposure that, for a second, I almost felt like I was watching a movie made before Friday the 13th. That quickly wore off when I realized that not a single major character in this movie was born when the original Friday the 13th came out. **",2,Paris Is Burning.,1132099200,"11 16, 2005",2005,4324,"['House', 'Wax', 'Jaume', 'Collet-Serra', '2005', 'had', 'assumed', 'movie', 'would', 'suck', 'simply', 'was', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'vehicle', 'really', 'was', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'vehicle', 'cast', 'was', 'built', 'Hilton', 'Then', 'rented', 'first', 'thing', 'see', 'Dark', 'Castle', 'Entertainment', 'logo', 'thought', ""'d"", 'gotten', 'away', 'doing', 'horrible', 'remakes', 'Not', 'so', 'guess.Collet-Serra', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'Dark', 'Castle', 'formula', 'closely', 'gather', 'bunch', 'young-and-beautifuls', 'make', 'act', 'far', 'average', 'standard', 'blow', 'most', 'special', 'effects', 'budget', 'one', 'really', 'cool', 'effect', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'talking', 'incessantly.In', 'case', 'young-and-beautifuls', 'number', 'six', 'are', 'Wade', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'girlfriend', 'Carly', '24', 'star', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'who', 'are', 'rocks', 'Carly', 'in-and-out-of-jail', 'twin', 'brother', 'Nick', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'Nick', 'best', 'friend', 'Blake', 'Robert', ""Ri'chard"", 'last', 'seen', 'Coach', 'Carter', 'girlfriend', 'Paige', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'then', 'Dalton', 'Boston', 'Public', 'Jon', 'Abraham', 'tagging', 'along', 'ride', 'annoying', 'kid', 'video', 'camera', 'who', 'de', 'rigeur', 'action', 'thriller', 'Trespass', 'twelve', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'way', 'big', 'football', 'game', 'when', 'shortcut', 'up', 'construction', 'have', 'find', 'place', 'camp', 'do', 'so', 'about', 'fifteen', 'miles', 'small', 'town', 'called', 'Ambrose', 'judging', 'surrounding', 'dialogue', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'Louisiana', 'sports', 'inhabitants', 'marked', 'lack', 'southern', 'accents', 'six', 'have', 'strange', 'run-in', 'mysterious', 'pickup', 'truck', 'go', 'sleep', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'posting', 'watch', 'wake', 'up', 'find', 'fan', 'belt', 'Wade', 'car', 'broken', 'Wade', 'Carly', 'stay', 'go', 'Ambrose', 'get', 'new', 'fan', 'belt', 'others', 'continue', 'game', 'Once', 'Ambrose', 'Wade', 'Carly', 'meet', 'Bo', 'Threshold', 'Brian', 'van', 'Holt', 'owner', 'local', 'gas', 'station', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'fan', 'belt', 'station', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'delivery', 'up', 'house', 'give', 'plot', 'summary', ""n't"", 'get', 'spoilerville', 'would', 'take', 'well', 'thousand', 'words', 'odd', 'how', 'when', 'everything', 'movie', 'so', 'completely', 'trivial', 'reach', 'same', 'level', 'unimportance', 'eventually', 'will', 'tell', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'page', '596', 'House', 'Wax', 'suffers', 'same', 'problems', 'well', 'one', 'Dark', 'Castle', 'other', 'flicks', 'date', 'young-and-beautifuls', 'are', 'recruited', 'mostly', 'TV', 'primetime', 'soap', 'operas', 'therefore', 'are', 'used', 'kind', 'overemoting', 'Dark', 'Castle', 'higher-ups', 'seem', 'find', 'acceptable', 'substitute', 'actual', 'acting', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'however', 'when', 'not', 'being', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'country', 'mile', 'turned', 'Murray', 'only', 'other', 'performance', 'film', 'even', 'close', 'Lester', '[', 'Son', 'Mask', 'Damon', 'Harriman', ']', 'part', 'small', 'effective', 'script', 'threadbare', 'say', 'least', 'having', 'thoroughly', 'jettisoned', 'everything', 'original', 'House', 'Wax', 'replaced', 'kind', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'vibe', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'halfway', 'effective', 'well', 'someone', 'had', ""n't"", 'already', 'remade', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'last', 'year', 'done', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'this.Its', 'strengths', 'are', 'fewer', 'again', 'cling', 'Dark', 'Castle', 'mold', 'everpresent', 'one', 'really', 'cool', 'special', 'effect', 'really', 'cool', 'house', 'wax', 'completely', 'made', 'wax', 'Which', 'sorts', 'nifty', 'melting', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'guy', 'running', 'path', 'crumbling', 'thing', 'Yeah', 'do', 'kind', 'novel', 'way', 'here', 'Dark', 'Castle', 'films', 'movie', 'inherently', 'watchable', 'partly', 'so', 'bad', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'partly', 'Dark', 'Castle', 'writing', 'stable', 'have', 'been', 'culled', 'ranks', 'soap', 'opera', 'writers', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'how', 'do', 'badly', 'Also', 'did', 'come', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Dark', 'Castle', 'broke', 'seeing', 'monster', 'too', 'much', 'mold', 'here', 'monster', 'so', 'little', 'exposure', 'second', 'almost', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'made', 'Friday', '13th', 'quickly', 'wore', 'off', 'when', 'realized', 'not', 'single', 'major', 'character', 'movie', 'was', 'born', 'when', 'original', 'Friday', '13th', 'came', 'out', '**']",N/A

But surprisingly, it's actually a really decent film.The first thing I notice is the opening sequence. It's startling, catches my attention and even throws me out of the loop a little bit. The way we're presented to the characters is not much of a big deal, it's actually quite ordinary. It may be hard to relate to them all, but I've seen a lot worse set ups in my time. At least the film moves forward to a new place without wasting all too much time.Later we are given hints of something mysterious going on, and when the violent and effects-driven parts of the film kick in, it's all driving, well-made and a strong slasher film with a few small surprises to spare.

The plot manages to save itself from being too typical by actually having a semi-lucid reason for the teen's woodsy frolics, and by avoiding the pitfalls of who will obviously be the first victim.The performances are not spectacular, but the characters are shallow enough not to require great skills from the actors.  The good parts of the movie is the photography and the FX, providing us with a unique squish of wax in that oozing place that satisfies us horror fans.A group of teens camp out on their way to try and grab tickets for a game.  A spooky encounter with a faceless truck leaves them with one car needing a fan belt.  Dividing up, two of the kids accept a ride into town with a sleazy redneck.  The town seems quaint but strange, and while waiting for the gas station owner to finish up with a funeral, the kids explore the House Of Wax.Not everything is as it seems though, there's more wax than meets the eye, and more to the wax than you would expect.  You'll never walk past a wax figure without scraping your fingernail over it, that much I promise.The most pleasing aspect of the film is when Paris Hilton 'gets the point' in a satisfyingly grisly scene, but the subplot of the brothers who run the House Of Wax is a pleasingly crunchy idea also.  The waxy FX in the finale is great, better than mud could ever be.  There is also a lovely carcass pit earlier in the film that you can practically smell through your television.All in all, a nice B horror movie to enjoy with lots of popcorn and beer.

The basic plot is a group of friends end up in a strange town pursued by two deranged brothers who want to kill them so they can add them to their wax figure collection.  There is plenty of action, and while I can't say that the film is actually scary, it is fairly gripping.  Unlike many similar movies the main characters are not invincible.  Until about  of the way though it is hard to predict who will survive and who will not.  Also, the back drop of the film, a town where some of the houses and many of the ""inhabitants"" are made of wax is interesting.  While not as good as some other recent horror movies (such as The Ring or Dawn of the Dead), it is definitely worth seeing.As a side note, be aware that the film starts slowly and the introductory sequences do not do justice to the rest of the film.  Indeed, initially I found the characters so irritating that I almost stopped watching.

The premise is simple but good: a group of friends on a road trip to see a big football game encounter car trouble, which leads them to not just an unusual house but to a whole town - not on the map - where it's immediately obvious that things are off-kilter, and from there two of the characters find themselves entering into the imposing titular structure.  Their abscence is a lure for more of the group to come into the bizarre town looking for them, where the scope of the weirdness starts to be revealed.Suspenseful, violent, eerie and sexy, ""House Of Wax"" has fantastic special effects and a universally talented cast (including Paris Hilton who everybody predicted was going to be terrible, but come to find out actually knows how to act) highlighted by the performances of Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray.

Then again any movie that has Paris Hilton as one of the stars and does not have her naked obviously is not gonna win a lot of praise from critics. So basically Hollywood is running out of ideals, so they are using old ideas and adding ""fresh faces"" into the mix, in hopes of scoring major bank atthe box office. Sadly they are lucky to even make their budget back most of the time. When will they learn. This is the second remake of the 1933 film. Though, this version is more of a remake of the 1955 movie that stared the late Vincent Price. In this movie we follow a group of young friends as they drive cross country to a football game. On the way they get into a little car trouble, leading the group into a weird old town in the middle of nowhere.This is where the unlucky outsiders meet a couple twins who 'don't take kindly to strangers' and seek to turn them into another one of their wax creations.The movie is not half bad, it's entertaining and the deaths were pretty cool, and surprisingly graphic for a theatrical release.I do have a couple complaints however. I had a hard time believing Chad Michael Murray's ' tough guy' persona and as the film went on, so did the plot holes; leading to a predictable climax. Overall a fairly decent remake.

I can't stand Paris Hilton and feel that she doesn't even have enough intelligence to tie her own shoes. But fellow Paris despisers can take heart as she's not in the movie for long durations at a time, so seeing her in this didn't bother me. The acting of the other members was just a step above Paris' abilities, but to be completely fair, the dialogue wasn't very compelling either. I've seen worse, as I've said many times before. I actually liked the storyline and there were a couple parts that caught me off guard. I did enjoy this movie despite its many shortcomings. It was creepy and the ending was really neat (I know that's very vague, but I thought it was really cool and if someone ruined it for me, well, I'd be a little miffed to say the least). For those that love watching kids go into the woods only not to come out ever again, you'll certainly enjoy this. You should also not cheap out and get a hotel room when it comes to these situations.

I went into this not expecting too much but I had heard about the awesome climax involving a melting house and figured that was worth the price of admission alone.  I came out surprised.  It actually is pretty decent.As the slasher horror genre goes, you have young co-eds who, through bad luck, sex etc getting into some trouble that constantly worsens.  Most of the time, the events that occur are because someone is running up the stairs instead of out the door, or going with the crazy hick who dumps roadkill in a disgusting mess on the side of the road and has pelts of animals hanging in his car and a huge knife on his belt.  That said, House of Wax follows the same conventions but normally they give a better reason for the protagonists to follow them than most slasher films.In fact, unlike movies like Scream and Wrong Turn, etc, the movie starts out slowly.  Not boring, not by any means.  But it isn't until at least half way in that someone dies.  In some movies this could be movie suicide as the audience gets bored.  But here, the director allows a sense of foreboding build.  While nothing major happens, there are all these signs that something isn't right and for most of the movie you have a pit in your stomach until the first death and the proverbial crap hits the fan.Honestly, the film isn't that great.  It's not something that transcends the horror genre, nor will it or should it win awards or go down as the best horror movie ever.  But what it does do, it does well: it is pretty scary.  It is also pretty gross.  Overall, if you want to see a good horror movie this season, I would recommend this over some of the others released this year.

928122,A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ,B000AM4P9K,the-gr8shag,"[10, 13]","Yet another crap slasher film that is way too formulaic. ""House Of Wax"" is easily one of the worst films of 2005.Six teenagers are on their way to a football game (whether its a college or NFL game is anyone's guess) when one of them decides to take a shortcut & accidently gets everyone lost. Instead of actually trying to get back on the right track (like the sensible person would) these six dullards decide to stop & pitch camp in the middle of Eastbumf*c*, USA for the night (obviously nobody in the group has watched ""Friday The 13th""). This is where the ""House Of Wax"" tries to add character to the, well, main characters & fails miserabley, with the kids partying away with failed attempts of light humor. Things turn to the weird when a pickup truck arrives out of nowhere & sits there staring at the group, with a mysterious driver quietly at the helm. Through some ""tense"" words the truck takes off leaving the kids alone.Fast forward to the following afternoon & with the group sleeping half the day away, its crunch time to get to the game. It's out of the frying pan & into the fire, as one of the kids' vehicles has a major problem - a snapped fanbelt. The group piles into their other vehicle & head into the local town. In one of the Grand Canyon size loopholes to this film, the gang don't realize that it's a ghost town & a bizarre one at that. Everything looks to be in full operation, but, no one's home. Someone or something is lurking in the shadows & with darkness setting in, the kids are gonna discover more than just a fanbelt.Borrowing the title & shocker plot thread from the original Vincent Price film of the same, this ""House Of Wax"" has nothing to do with the previous incarnation. With that said, this movie just plain sucks. The film is just a cookie cutter slasher film that doesn't bring anything new to the genre. The damn thing isn't even scary. The cast is annoying & stupid. The overall story about the conjoined twins with the crazy family plotline is stale & has been done to death.The DVD special features are pathetic. It's one big a*s-kissfest. I've never even heard of Jaume Collett-Serra, the director of this three car pileup. The commentary feature is an absolute joke. I started to watch this with the four leads lending their ""input"" on the production of the film. After 2 minutes I couldn't watch anymore. Here is a sampling - Chad Michael Murray, Paris Hilton, Elisha Cuthburt, & Hilton's boyfriend from the movie (is it important to know his name?) are sitting on a couch watching the film.Cuthburt: ""Here is the scene with us in the tents.""Hilton: ""Didn't we film this, like, almost a year ago.""Cuthburt: ""Mmm-hmm. In a few months it will be a year.""What the hell IS that!? The other problem is that while this keeps going they slowly distance themselves from the most important person - the viewer!

A group of young, good looking twenty-somethings out on a roadtrip ending up in a backwoods town where a sadistic family preys on them.  We've seen this before in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, House of 1000 Corpses, Wrong Turn, to name just a few.  No, it's not original but what it lacks in originality it more than makes up for in execution.The group of six that includes Carly and her brother Nick (Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray) are joined by Carly's boyfriend Wade (Jared Padelecki of TV's Supernatural), Nick's buddy Dalton, and Paige (Paris Hilton) and her boyfriend Blake.  The group are travelling to a football game when Wade's car breaks a fan belt.  Wade and Carly go into town to get a replacement and find the town basically deserted.  People peek out from curtains but the streets are deserted.They interrupt a funeral at a small church and Bo, who owns the town garage offers to help.  While waiting for Bo the pair visit the strange house of wax that has many extremely life-like wax figures but none of them look like anyone famous.  Bo lures them back to the house where the truth is revealed...that he and his brother, the masked Vincent make their creations with real bodies and lure unsuspecting motorists into the ghost town by false detour signs.  One by one the brothers pick off the group with paris Hilton getting the award for most gruesome death in the film.What sets House of Wax apart from others of its ilk is the inventiveness of the House of Wax itself.  The building is completely made of wax...the walls, the floors, the furniture, all wax which leads to a truly awe-inspired climax.  Cuthbert, looking very different with darker hair than she did in ""The Girl Next Door"" presents a strong female heroine.  Even after having her lips super-glued together and having a finger tip cut off, she fights back with zeal and is the most interesting character in the movie.

928128,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000AM4P9K,trebe,"[0, 0]","A horror adventure featuring a group of twentysomethings, House Of Wax (2005) bears practically no resemblance to the Vincent Price horror classic from 1953.  Not a remake, director Jaume Collett-Serra's (Unknown, Orphan) film is a demented tale of terror set in a small ""forgotten"" town.  While not at all credible, and with some pretty annoying victims, the film does have some creepy moments, impressive special effects, and one magnificent kill of a socialite turned actress.With the realism of a Scooby Doo adventure, the film's flimsy premise is that the town of Ambrose has somehow dropped off the map, and been forgotten, although strangely it is somehow still getting power from the local grid, and is wired such that most electrical loads are connected to a bank of circuit breakers located in an underground tunnel.  Now closed, the House Of Wax museum was once Ambrose's main attraction.  The only residents of the town are brothers, one runs the local gas station, while the other is an expert in coating the human body with wax.On their way to see a football game, a group of friends have a little car trouble.  Looking for a replacement part, Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert, hot at the time from being on TV's 24) and her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki) arrive in Ambrose, where they meet Bo (Brian Van Holt) the owner of the service station.  The couple is at Bo's home, when things unexpectedly take a nasty turn.What follows isn't credible, but it is rather suspenseful, gory, and kind of fun, as Carly becomes a prisoner in a room below the service station.  What Bo wants isn't clear, but he's apparently into collecting body parts.  Luckily Carly's brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray) arrives in town in the nick of time, and manages to rescue her, but the pair is forced to flee, when Bo opens fire with a shotgun.Looking to add to his collection of waxed corpses, Bo's brother Vincent (Van Holt in a dual role) acts decisively to capture or kill whoever crosses his path.  In one of the film's best scenes, Vincent miraculously manages to find members the group camping in the woods, and brutally disposes of them.  Paige (Paris Hilton) attempts to escape, and even strikes back at Vincent, but is brutally slain in spectacular fashion.Back in Ambrose, the siblings are trapped in Bo's house when Vincent returns with the dead bodies of their friends.  Nick discovers a secret tunnel leading to the museum, and while trying to escape from Vincent, sets fire to the structure, which actually is made of wax.  The scenes of the burning and melting wax structure, with the people struggling to move in the sticky mess, is pretty cool and quite well done.A Dark Castle production shot on location in Australia, House of Wax is shaky like a house of cards, but if you put realism on the back burner, the film is mostly redeemed by the gore and special effects.  It's pretty darn slick in the production and effects departments, concluding with the museum melting down to the ground in a glorious inferno.

928129,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000AM4P9K,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","'House of Wax,' another horror from Dark Castle Entertainment, which previously produced 'Ghost Ship' 'Gothika' and others, is an average slasher film with generic script.  The film is most likely to be linked to Paris Hilton (who is only fourth-billed), but the real talent behind this film should be Graham 'Grace' Walker, who provided wonderful production designs.  But, story first.The fact is, 'House of Wax' is a remake of Vincent Price classic horror, but in name only.  It is more like a rip-off of 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' and as you see, six college students foolishly stray into Southern Nowhereville, where some crazy people are prowling with a bloody knife or something.  The difference from the Tobe Hooper classic is that this time they get to the murderer's house after finding a short-cut by messing around GPS of their car.  Original, isn't it?[NICE PRODUCTION DESIGNS] In spite of pretty boring first-half, however, 'House of Wax' gets into gear when we are introduced to the fictional town of Ambrose, spooky place with an old movie theater (where 'What Ever Happened to Baby Jane' is still showing), and of course, a wax museum.  Though Jaume Collet-Serra did a good job as director, the production designs by Graham Walker is much more impressive than the very gory and painful deaths themselves.I have no objection to the cardboard characters played by Elisha Cuthbert et al, who do silliest things -- 'I go this way, you go that way' kind of thing -- but perhaps we should not talk about it right now.  As to Paris Hilton, she certainly can dance nicely in underwear.  And she even allows for some embarrassing self-parodying (is it so?) by being video-taped while doing what you don't want to know.The film has some scary moments that end with bloody deaths, but real originality comes at the end with a big finale in the wax museum.  Except that, like similar horrors (recent example, 'Wrong Turn') 'House of Wax' is an average slasher horror with a few redeeming points.",3,"Well, I Expected Worse ...

928130,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000AM4P9K,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","HOUSE OF WAX is a remake of a 1953 picture of the same name that starred Vincent Price.  Having never yet seen the original, I can't comment on comparisons between the two films.  This version of the story was produced by Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis, among others, and was the feature directorial debut of Jaume Collet-Serra. I was a bit hesitant to watch the movie because the picture was promoted as Paris Hilton's breakout role. In fact, she was the first person cast in the movie and the rest of the cast was built around her.  However, despite my reluctance to originally watch the movie, HOUSE OF WAX is actually a fairly decent slasher-suspense movie.The plot of the movie is fairly simple.  A group of six college-age friends leave together on a roadtrip to see the biggest football game of the year in Louisiana.  They leave the main road to take a shortcut.  The shortcut ends up having a detour and the group camps for the night in a woody field.  That night the group is harassed by a man in a pickup truck.  One of the friends, Nick Jones (Chad Michael Murray), throws a beer bottle at the truck, breaking a headlight which for whatever reason causes the driver to leave.  That night Nick's twin sister, Carly (Elisha Cuthbert), is awaken by noises she hears outside of their tent. She investigates, but doesn't find anything.  However, the next day Carly's boyfriend, Wade (Jared Padalecki) discovers that the fan belt to his car has been cut.  Wade and Carly hitch a ride into a nearby town with a creepy guy who picks up road kill for a living to get a fan belt while the rest of the group leaves to go to the game.  Traffic is so bad that the group misses most of the game and comes back to the campsite. Meanwhile, Wade and Carly find themselves wandering around a dingy looking town that looked like it once was quaint.  The town professes to have a famous wax museum that Wade and Carly investigate. As it turns out, the wax house is literally made of wax as is most everything in it and the figures are so lifelike.  Of course, there's a reason for that as Wade, Carly, and the rest of their friends soon find out.You would think that the worst part of this movie would be Paris Hilton.  That's really not the case.  Her character is very wooden with hardly any emotional depth, but that's exactly how her character is supposed to be.  There's a fair enough amount of suspense and just enough gore to give the film an overall eerie mood.The film has one huge weakness: the stupidity factor.  I realize that horror films in general require a huge suspension of disbelief and almost always have characters doing things very, very stupid. However, in HOUSE OF WAX that seems more prevalent than normal. For instance, take the character of Wade. As an audience member, you're supposed to like Wade. He's Carly's boyfriend and is supposed to be a nice guy, the kind a girl can take home to her parents are ask move to New York with her to begin a new life. Yet, Wade once Wade meets the guy who picks up road kill, he turns rude and abrasive.  I couldn't wait until he got killed because the whole time he was in Ambrose, he was a complete jerk: smarting off to strangers, breaking into closed buildings, searching through people's personnel items.  Or take Paris Hilton's character, Paige.  At one point Paige is being chased by a killer and arms herself with a pole, but eventually leaves the pole behind. Or how about the fact that while wondering around the town the only person anyone ever sees and meets is Bo? I grew up in a town smaller than Ambrose and even late at night your bound to see cars driving around or someone walking around.Overall, despite starring Paris Hilton and filled with bad acting, HOUSE OF WAX is a better-than-expected suspense-slasher movie.The DVD special features include an alternate opening scene, b-roll and blooper video with cast commentary, Joel Silver revealing HOUSE OF WAX (watch Joel get ran over by a car), ""Wax On: the Design of the House of Wax"" featurette about how the town of Ambrose, Louisiana was created, ""The House Built on Wax"" featurette about how the actual wax house in HOUSE OF WAX was created, and the theatrical trailer.",3,Better Than Expected,1226793600,"11 16, 2008",2008,4202,"['HOUSE', 'OF', 'WAX', 'remake', '1953', 'picture', 'same', 'name', 'starred', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Having', 'never', 'yet', 'seen', 'original', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'comparisons', 'two', 'films', 'version', 'story', 'was', 'produced', 'Joel', 'Silver', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'others', 'was', 'feature', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Jaume', 'Collet-Serra', 'was', 'bit', 'hesitant', 'watch', 'movie', 'picture', 'was', 'promoted', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'breakout', 'role', 'fact', 'was', 'first', 'person', 'cast', 'movie', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'built', 'However', 'reluctance', 'originally', 'watch', 'movie', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'WAX', 'actually', 'fairly', 'decent', 'slasher-suspense', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'fairly', 'simple', 'group', 'six', 'college-age', 'friends', 'leave', 'together', 'roadtrip', 'see', 'biggest', 'football', 'game', 'year', 'Louisiana', 'leave', 'main', 'road', 'take', 'shortcut', 'shortcut', 'up', 'having', 'detour', 'group', 'camps', 'night', 'woody', 'field', 'night', 'group', 'harassed', 'man', 'pickup', 'truck', 'One', 'friends', 'Nick', 'Jones', 'Chad', 'Michael', 'Murray', 'beer', 'bottle', 'truck', 'breaking', 'headlight', 'reason', 'driver', 'leave', 'night', 'Nick', 'twin', 'sister', 'Carly', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'awaken', 'noises', 'tent', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'However', 'next', 'day', 'Carly', 'boyfriend', 'Wade', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'fan', 'belt', 'car', 'been', 'cut', 'Wade', 'Carly', 'hitch', 'ride', 'nearby', 'town', 'creepy', 'guy', 'who', 'up', 'road', 'kill', 'living', 'get', 'fan', 'belt', 'rest', 'group', 'go', 'game', 'Traffic', 'so', 'bad', 'group', 'most', 'game', 'back', 'campsite', 'Meanwhile', 'Wade', 'Carly', 'find', 'wandering', 'dingy', 'looking', 'town', 'looked', 'once', 'was', 'quaint', 'town', 'have', 'famous', 'wax', 'museum', 'Wade', 'Carly', 'investigate', 'out', 'wax', 'house', 'literally', 'made', 'wax', 'most', 'everything', 'figures', 'are', 'so', 'lifelike', 'course', 'reason', 'Wade', 'Carly', 'rest', 'friends', 'soon', 'find', 'out.You', 'would', 'think', 'worst', 'part', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'really', 'not', 'case', 'character', 'very', 'wooden', 'hardly', 'emotional', 'depth', 'exactly', 'how', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'fair', 'enough', 'amount', 'suspense', 'just', 'enough', 'gore', 'give', 'film', 'overall', 'eerie', 'mood.The', 'film', 'one', 'huge', 'weakness', 'stupidity', 'factor', 'realize', 'horror', 'films', 'general', 'require', 'huge', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'almost', 'always', 'have', 'characters', 'doing', 'things', 'very', 'very', 'stupid', 'However', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'WAX', 'more', 'prevalent', 'normal', 'instance', 'take', 'character', 'Wade', 'audience', 'member', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'like', 'Wade', 'Carly', 'boyfriend', 'supposed', 'be', 'nice', 'guy', 'kind', 'girl', 'can', 'take', 'home', 'parents', 'are', 'ask', 'move', 'New', 'York', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'Wade', 'once', 'Wade', 'meets', 'guy', 'who', 'up', 'road', 'kill', 'rude', 'abrasive', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'got', 'killed', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'Ambrose', 'was', 'complete', 'jerk', 'smarting', 'off', 'strangers', 'breaking', 'closed', 'buildings', 'searching', 'people', 'personnel', 'items', 'take', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'character', 'Paige', 'one', 'point', 'Paige', 'being', 'chased', 'killer', 'arms', 'pole', 'eventually', 'pole', 'behind', 'how', 'fact', 'wondering', 'town', 'only', 'person', 'anyone', 'ever', 'sees', 'meets', 'Bo', 'grew', 'up', 'town', 'smaller', 'Ambrose', 'even', 'late', 'night', 'bound', 'see', 'cars', 'driving', 'around', 'someone', 'walking', 'around.Overall', 'starring', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'filled', 'bad', 'acting', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'WAX', 'better-than-expected', 'suspense-slasher', 'movie.The', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'alternate', 'opening', 'scene', 'b-roll', 'blooper', 'video', 'cast', 'commentary', 'Joel', 'Silver', 'revealing', 'HOUSE', 'WAX', 'watch', 'Joel', 'get', 'ran', 'car', 'Wax', 'Design', 'House', 'Wax', 'featurette', 'how', 'town', 'Ambrose', 'Louisiana', 'was', 'created', 'House', 'Built', 'Wax', 'featurette', 'how', 'actual', 'wax', 'house', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'WAX', 'was', 'created', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A

928133,A2USTECHX1PKVA,B000AM4P9K,"Weedwacker ""I'm a doctor of STEW.""","[3, 3]","I saw House of Wax in the theater and after having anticipated its release for several months I found it fairly disappointing.  Not the worst movie ever and although it had its high points it was certainly not the best either.  I left feeling like it could have been so much more; I also felt that it was not truly a remake of House of Wax as it shares almost nothing with the two original films of the same name except its recognizable title.In fact, I seem to be the only person who thinks it was actually meant to be a remake of a 1979 horror flick called ""Tourist Trap""--a freaky, scary horror movie that gives me the chills so much that I can really only tolerate watching it once every year or two and only in a fully lit room, with at least one other person present!  This House of Wax has FAR more in common with Tourist Trap than any previous House of Wax film.  I think someone realized what a great and truly creepy movie Tourist Trap is but also understood that it is not one of the more well known horror films and decided to call it House of Wax in order to bank on Vincent Price's name and talents.  Watch the either of the two previous House of Wax movies, then watch Tourist Trap (not recommending you watch that one alone!) then watch this House of Wax and make your own decision...That being said despite my lukewarm feelings for Wax in the theater, which I later chalked up to having had a headache at the time and not being in a very good mood, I did buy it right off the bat once it was released on dvd.  I have seen it so many times now that I can't even count.  Regardless of its shortcomings it has become one of my favorite horror movies to throw on when I fall asleep or as background noise when I am cleaning.  :-)House of Wax just seems to work better on the small screen than it did in the theater.  Good points: casting. Yes, even Ms. Hilton seems to have a place in the film.  I found the characters and actors to be quite believable in their roles and thought they had good chemistry and worked well together.  Are they all the best actors around?  No, but for what the movie is supposed to be I think they fit the bill nicely.Suspense is another good point in the film.  While it does take a bit of time for us to get to any real action (the movie clocks in at approximately 48 minutes before anyone is even attacked and this may be part of the reason a lot of people see it as dull or over-long) once we do arrive it is very suspenseful.  Until the tail end of the story the movie avoids some traditional cliches and actually DOES do some stuff that you don't expect.  In the theater I was saying to myself ""Oh they're not gonna do that, no, they're not REALLY gonna do it"" but they did--won't tell you what as I don't want to spoil anything.  In the down time that leads up to that 48 minute mark where the movie explodes we do get a lot of very good character development, another point that no one can accuse the movie of falling short on.The visuals are wonderful!  It is pretty amazing the incredible detail and hard work that went into creating this town where the movie takes place, and such work should be acknowledged and appreciated.  I enjoyed the behind the scenes look at creating the buildings and props and so on and I feel like it's a shame the movie didn't do as well as it could have in theaters for the reason alone that so many will miss the great set design and work that went into it.One weak point overall is the music.  The score is very good at certain points and totally ineffective or lacking in others.  For the most part it is adequate but the songs that are played in the movie are terrible and add nothing to the feel or emotion.  A minor complaint!  Towards the end of the movie the dialogue becomes run-of-the-mill and we've heard it all before but I did like the dynamics of the surviving characters.  The one thing that annoys me to no end with this movie is the very last thing they do in it.  Incredibly unnecessary and ridiculous thing to tack on to the end and it nearly ruins some of the story (for me at least).  When rating this movie I usually knock off a full star due to that alone.Overall, with House of Wax you are not going to be in for a mind-blowing experience but you will be in for some great visuals, strong performances, good suspense and a horror movie that is not quite the same as the rest.Just as a side note...for anyone who is not familiar with the movie Tourist Trap, please seek it out and watch it!

If you are looking for a nicely paced horror flick then this isa lot more enjoyable than many other teen horrors that have surfaced in recent years. Forget the bad press about Paris Hilton - her performance wasn't too bad at all, even if it was quite small.What I liked most about this film is the genuine creepy atmosphere and the originality with most of the murder scenes.  Considering I was initially expecting a bad horror film based on reviews, I ended up being pleasantly surprised.  Even more so, I did not fast forward any scenes.  The only annoying thing about the film was the boyfriend who kept dsoing stupid things. For example, he went snooping around the house after he had used the killer's toilet ... meanwhile his poor girlfriend was waiting outside.  He kept on snooping despite seeing weird things which would make any sane person run straight for the door.

928135,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B000AM4P9K,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[3, 3]","House of Wax is not a very scary movie compared to the recent The Amityville Horror, because it failed to be consistently captivating with visual and psychological thrills. The first third of the film is more of sex comedy. I know they were trying to sell Paris Hilton's sex appeal, and deliberately put in a ala Victoria Secret seduction number while the movie was losing track of it's horror values. It shouldn't have taken the group of buddies to encounter the Wax monsters so late in the movie, because it had wasted so much time on irrelevant scenes. It didn't become a gripping horror experience for the audiences and most of the victims until the last half an hour of the film.Paris Hilton did a pretty decent job when she was running around barefoot in her bras while the killer pursued her in the parking lot. She even get to shed to a load fearful tears, but she's still just a mere supporting role, depite the advertising is focused on her.I really didn't understand why the characters, besides the Trudy's sons, are so hideously stupid. Their actions and curiosity easily put them into traps set up by the Wax guys. For instance, Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray easily trusted the demented looking trucker who happened to be one of  Trudy's sons.The wax sculptures are very impressive, especially when one of the victims' layer of wax gets peeled away and revealed the blooded underlayer while his eys were still blinking.

928136,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000AM4P9K,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","Before objecting to my rating a film like this 5-Stars, please hear me out.First of all, this is not a remake of the splendid 1953 Vincent Price cult flick of the same name. The only thing these two films have in common is their title, their genre, and the fact that they both somehow involve a wax museum. For this reason it's a mite pointless to compare the two as they are, in fact, two totally different stories. (Even so, I'm going to do just that at the end of this review).THE STORY: Six college students (4 dudes and 2 gals) drive from Gainesville to Baton Rouge to attend an important football game. Since it's a long trip, they camp out in the woods somewhere off I-10. One of their cars strangely won't run the next day and they discover a mysterious town in the sticks while looking for a fan belt. It is there that they encounter the titular House of Wax. Horror and death ensue.Although the first 10 minutes or so are fairly unimpressive, the story starts to capture your attention at the campout sequence. From there their encounter with a horrible stench, a local hick, and the mystery of the isolated town & wax museum gradually pulls you in. The fairly slow initial 50-minutes are an important character-building and mystery-building foundation to the final horrific hour.The major protagonist of the story is the awe-inspiringly fair Elisha Cuthbert, who was only 22 years old during filming. The eminently glamorous (and infamous) Paris Hilton also stars and does a commendable job, but Elisha utterly blows her out of the water as far as all-around beauty goes.Speaking of Ms. Hilton, [minor Spoiler alert] she does indeed buy the farm in this film and, the way it happens, just made me bust out laughing! The film's worth checking out for this scene alone, especially if you despise her.The picture was shot in Queensland, Australia, of all places, but it works well as a stand-in for the deep South. The filmmaking is top-notch in all categories; even the rest of the no-name cast do a fine job. As a matter of fact, the six college kids are all rather likable, even Nick (Chad Michael Murray), Elisha's supposedly 'black sheep' twin.The story, albeit highly unlikely, is played straight and serious by all involved; there's no silly ""comedic relief"" or camp to be seen.BOTTOM LINE: So why do I give such a film as this 5-Stars? Simply because ""House of Wax"" works fabulously for what it IS, a mystery/horror flick. Everyone knows going in that this isn't going to be ""Gandhi"" (not that I've ever seen that award-winning epic film -- sssnnnnoooorrrreeee). But if you're in the mood for an entertaining, engrossing and imaginative mystery/horror picture, look no further; ""House of Wax"" has everthing you could possibly want in such a film. Why do I describe it as imaginative? Just wait till you see the conclusion's spectacular melting wax museum and you'll know what I mean; this is F/X at its finest.COMPARISON: Plotwise, ""House of Wax"" is an obvious mixture of the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974) and the 1953 film of the same name. I fully realize that motion pictures must be judged according to the time they were made, their originality (or lack) at that time, and the limitations thereof. But if one were to objectively view both of these movies back-to-back with this modern ""House of Wax"" and honestly judge which film is better TODAY, (not in 1974, not in 1953, but TODAY), she or he would have no choice but to conclude that this 2005 ""House of Wax"" blows 'em both out of the water. Cinematic blasphemy? Perhaps.

928137,A3028S6C0F8BF0,B000AM4P9K,"W.W. Nowe ""enggs""","[1, 2]","House of wax is a slasher film, but it's not your typical slasher film. The plot sounds familiar: group of people on a road trip get sidetracked; end up in bizarre, little town; get hunted down like animals. Three things make this film stand out.First, is the setup. This movie takes a long time to get going. About half of the movie goes by before there's any action. The film uses this time to let us become familiarized with the characters. Most horror movies are in such a haste to get to the action, they start killing off characters immediately. House of Wax lets us build at least some interest in these people before attacking them. It also uses this time to display the truly creepy atmosphere of this small town. The first half of this movie really does play like a horror movie from the '50's or '60's. It relies on good characters, mood, and atmosphere to create a disturbing feeling while watching it.Second, is the violence. When the action finally starts, it goes all out. The second half of the move is slasher all the way. This is an incredibly violent movie and the violence is extremely graphic. This movie is right up there with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. There are three parts in particular - one involves super glue, one involves wire cutters, and one involves a baseball bat - that even the most hard core horror fan could not help but appreciate. It might seem uneven, blending '50's and '60's horror with teen-slasher horror, but it really flows well. It's like watching a crack grow in a dam before it explodes.Third, is the ending. The climax of this film is amazing. The setting is an absolute work of art. It takes place as the hero's are trying to escape from a burning building. The walls are melting around them. The ceiling is melting down on top of them. The floor is melting beneath their feet. The only way to escape is to fight their way past two psychotic, serial killers. The killers are armed with knives; the hero's with a baseball bat. How the heroine uses that bat against one of the villains may be the most graphic act of violence I've ever seen in a movie (I challenge you to think of an equal). But, then, you can hardly blame her after what he did to her using the super glue and wire cutters.A great horror film.",5,"Super glue, wire cutters, and a baseball bat.

Definitely a change from the Vincent Price version of the story, which is fine, because if you aren't going to change anything, why do a remake?  Still, I felt this movie was a bit too much like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  A group of kids on a road trip who end up stopping in a small hick town where they run into some redneck weirdos who are hiding a disfigured brother... hmm.  Where have we heard this before?  That's my only real complaint about the movie - the changes to the original story made House of Wax just a wee bit too much like the Texas Chainsaw story.On the other hand, it was a cool idea to have the entire town be made up of nothing but wax covered people who were murdered one by one.  The action & suspense were enough to hold my interest the entire movie (which isn't always easy to do for me), and the acting was respectable considering the fact that this movie stuck with the usual formula of rounding up a bunch of good looking kids to base the story on.

I skipped plenty of parts as to not waste all of my time and i didn't miss a beat of the action. The good part about the movie was that the bad people actually died and the black person wasn't the first to die. Also, the story was revealed and the white people weren't that clich'ed towards the end they actually opened their eyes and fought til the death. It was a great movie in the regards that everyone didn't die and the two fraternal twins worked together in the end. Lastly, even if they do come out with a sequel ,which I would doubt, because the third brother doesn't do wax, he picks up road kill it wouldn't hold up to audiences.",3,Slow but better towards the end.,1175731200,"04 5, 2007",2007,765,"['Aside', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'slow', 'had', 'get', 'hour', 'movie', 'anyone', 'died', 'skipped', 'plenty', 'parts', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'beat', 'action', 'good', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'bad', 'people', 'actually', 'died', 'black', 'person', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'die', 'Also', 'story', 'was', 'revealed', 'white', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", ""clich'ed"", 'end', 'actually', 'opened', 'eyes', 'fought', 'til', 'death', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'regards', 'everyone', 'did', ""n't"", 'die', 'two', 'fraternal', 'twins', 'worked', 'together', 'end', 'Lastly', 'even', 'do', 'come', 'out', 'sequel', 'would', 'doubt', 'third', 'brother', ""n't"", 'do', 'wax', 'up', 'road', 'kill', 'would', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'audiences']",N/A
