1451120,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B0059XTUH2,amerdale876,"[1, 1]","As far as documentaries go, this is probably one of the most important contemporary ones out there -- especially if you're a parent or soon-to-be parent. Most would say that bullying (whether being bullied or being the bully) when you're a kid is ""just a part of growing up"" or that ""it builds character."" I find that those who say that were either never bullied growing up or they were the bully. And so does director Lee Hirsch, who was bullied as a kid. Someone once said, ""The side that bullies soon forgets, but the side which is bullied will never forget."" And truer words have never been spoken. Especially in a scene where boy #1 (who was just bullied by boy #2) is pulled over by an assistant principal and she forces boy #1 and boy #2 to shake hands, thinking that will absolve the physical altercation that had just occurred; when boy #1 (who is fed up) won't ""sincerely"" shake the hand of the boy who was just pounding on him, the principal scolds the bullied boy #1! Frustrating and angering. Fortunately, this film did accomplish what it set out to do: zero-tolerance policies toward bullying have been taken by most of America's schools and there is more understanding and empathy toward a child when he/she says they are being bullied. The segments in this film are powerful and some of the blind-eye action that is going on within school administration, stating that ""everything is fine"" when video proof shows otherwise, is appalling.

1451129,A7EJERNB7IK3Z,B0059XTUH2,CQ DX,"[0, 0]","This is a truly excellent, yet disturbing documentary which follows a few typical American families affected by the scourge of bullying. The most alarming and tragic part of the film is the realization that some of these kids are even committing suicide at a young age, in order to escape the pain and torment they feel from being bullied! Real solutions are not offered or discussed in any kind of depth, being that this is of course a complex subject open to many, varied solutions. The purpose of the film was to show what bullying is or can be like, and how it negatively can affect families and communities. Personally, I feel that there should be national anti-bullying laws on the book, because clearly a large cross section of parents (and school administrators) in this country don't know how to be good, rational, helpful ones.  For example, one of the teen subjects in this film was being bullied and ostracized simply for being gay. Of course, she was growing up in a small, homogenous Bible belt 'cow town' in Oklahoma. No surprise here! Close-minded, overly religious, hatemongering, insecure zealots who view homosexuality as a 'sin' or perversion (it's not- you are BORN this way) often raise their kids to shun and/or ignore others who are gay anyway.  Anti-bullying laws would not only protect our kids from the bullies themselves-  they would also protect kids from the sheer ignorance and hate that stems from hateful and prejudiced parents as well!

""Bully"" is a movie about bullying--that age old rite of passage for many, many young children.  I call it a rite of passage because I suffered from bullying.  And I received about as much support from the teachers and other school staff as the poor children in this movie.  Turn away, look the other way, jump on the abused with both feet; it all is like some sort of shark feeding frenzy.  But there are no sharks.  Instead you have wolves planning their next meal, awaiting their next prey, and they are oh so meticulous in their hunt.""Bully"" was so hard to watch.  I guess seeing what happened to these children (some lived; some did not) brought back too many memories of how I felt.  I had no one to turn to:  my parents were vicious people who thought every problem could be solved with clinched fists or clubs of some sort; teachers would not help, and if you would have gone to the police, you'd have been laughed out of their office.  These children suffered the same:  the vice principal who was about as useful as a screendoor on a submarine.  I was repulsed at her trying to make a bullying victim feel that somehow he was just as much to blame as his tormentor was.The viewer is introduced to many cases of bullying.  Alex Hopkins was one child who suffered so many indignities on a daily basis, that he finally began to feel NOTHING.  His parents (or what passed for parents) were in complete denial of what he was going through.  The conversation that his father had with him (in the presence of Alex's sister) was sickening.  All the father was concerned about was what was Alex going to do to protect his sister because she was already being picked on.  Sister's reply was, ""They pick on me because they think you're creepy.""  What was the father's reaction:  ZERO.  You then are introduced to Kelby, a young lesbian who has just come to terms with her sexuality.  Fellow classmates refused to sit by her, she was not allowed to attend her former church (there's a christian for ya'), and she was a constant target of abuse.  I remember her first statement was, ""I'm not going anywhere; I'm going to stay here and change things.""  Unfortunately, the movie ended with her saying ""Maybe it's time I went somewhere else and tried to make a difference.""  You meet Ja'Maya Jackson, a black youth whose daily bullying ended with her facing life in prison.  She was 13.  It seems most people think unless blood is drawn, then there's ""no harm/no foul.""  But I have told many people, I would much rather be hit than endure the mental abuse that goes hand-in-hand with bullying.

He killed himself.""Bully"" was directed by Lee Hirsch, is rated PG-13, and lasts 99 minutes.

1451132,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B0059XTUH2,Doug Park,"[2, 2]","BULLY is a straightforward survey of actual cases of bullying in various public schools across the country. Especially pertinent are the two cases it presents of suicides--one of which involved an 11-year-old boy, Ty Fields-Smalley, in Perkins, Oklahoma--that resulted from antagonism in school. The projects undertaken by the boy's father, Kirk Smalley, are both poignant and practical in illustrating ways to combat this problem. The interviews with the parents of all the 5 or 6 subject-students are similarly valuable.I was hoping for more cause-effect analysis of the specific reasons WHY bullying takes place; e.g., bullies are often bullied themselves at home or elsewhere. While it's true that many schools could do more to address and prevent the problem, more realistic assessment of the problems schools face would also be helpful. The whole tone of this film suggests that most public schools have the attitude, ""Kids will be kids, and there's not much we can do about that,"" which, as I know from substitute teaching in two different states, is hardly the case. Teachers and administrators are usually outnumbered by students by a ratio of  15:1 or more, and it is indeed hard to have a complete, objective picture of every situation that occurs and where/how it started. Some examination of crowd psychology and how groups of children often gang up on individuals they perceive as different (just as adults often do) would be especially helpful in showing the complexities of this behavior.This documentary is more than worthwhile for anyone interested in this issue, but it greatly oversimplifies the problem of ""bully""-""victim"" relationships.",4,"A Valuable Documentary, but More for the Heart than the Head",1362096000,"03 1, 2013",2013,1658,"['BULLY', 'straightforward', 'survey', 'actual', 'cases', 'bullying', 'various', 'public', 'schools', 'country', 'Especially', 'pertinent', 'are', 'two', 'cases', 'suicides', 'one', 'involved', '11-year-old', 'boy', 'Ty', 'Fields-Smalley', 'Perkins', 'Oklahoma', 'resulted', 'antagonism', 'school', 'projects', 'undertaken', 'boy', 'father', 'Kirk', 'Smalley', 'are', 'poignant', 'practical', 'illustrating', 'ways', 'combat', 'problem', 'interviews', 'parents', '5', '6', 'subject-students', 'are', 'similarly', 'valuable.I', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'cause-effect', 'analysis', 'specific', 'reasons', 'WHY', 'bullying', 'place', 'bullies', 'are', 'often', 'bullied', 'home', 'elsewhere', 'true', 'many', 'schools', 'could', 'do', 'more', 'address', 'prevent', 'problem', 'more', 'realistic', 'assessment', 'problems', 'schools', 'face', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'helpful', 'whole', 'tone', 'film', 'most', 'public', 'schools', 'have', 'attitude', 'Kids', 'will', 'be', 'kids', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'know', 'substitute', 'teaching', 'two', 'different', 'states', 'hardly', 'case', 'Teachers', 'administrators', 'are', 'usually', 'outnumbered', 'students', 'ratio', '15:1', 'more', 'indeed', 'hard', 'have', 'complete', 'objective', 'picture', 'situation', 'where/how', 'started', 'examination', 'crowd', 'psychology', 'how', 'groups', 'children', 'often', 'gang', 'up', 'individuals', 'perceive', 'different', 'just', 'adults', 'often', 'do', 'would', 'be', 'especially', 'helpful', 'showing', 'complexities', 'behavior.This', 'documentary', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'anyone', 'interested', 'issue', 'greatly', 'problem', 'bully', 'victim', 'relationships']",The Bully Project
1451133,ACW4P33TPKDWW,B0059XTUH2,Drew from Oregon,"[0, 1]","This review does contain spoilers.  I was fortunate enough to obtain a copy of this DVD for review.Bully is a movie that will bring almost every emotion out within you as it goes over the subject of bullying and tells some victim's stories as well.  When watching this documentary, you will get angry and sad for sure and it just might remind you of your childhood days.Bully starts out by telling the story of Tyler Long, 17 years old, who was bullied at school so much, it got so bad, that he had killed himself to escape the nightmarish, unbearable days he was living.  You can see the pain and you can feel it yourself when Tyler's parents tell the story of what type of kid he was, his personality, and, eventually, the day they found him dead in his room.  Tyler Long isn't the only story they tell of a bullied teen committing suicide.  We also hear the story of Ty Long, 11 years old, as well.  The movie even goes as far as to show Ty's funeral to tug at the hearts of the viewers even more.  The viewer thinks to himself, how can it so bad to make one commit suicide?  Ty's father made a good point in the film saying if Ty was a politicians child, changes would happen tomorrow; however, I would take that statement even farther and say a politician's child probably would be attending a private school instead of public.Bully follows a couple of teens around, mainly Alex, 12 years old from Sioux City, Iowa, who comes from a family of five kids.  We see as he's waiting for a bus to come pick him up for school, a young boy threatens to beat him up.  While on the bus, a kid threatens to stab and kill him as well.  Where bullies always this bad?  Threatening to kill someone?  When growing up back in the day, bullies never thought about threatening someone's life like they did in the movie.  Alex just takes the punishments and says he's used to it, but you can tell, from his interviews, that he's got a lot of pain in his heart.  You can hear it in his voice as he talks quietly about the bullies he's had to face on a daily basis.  Alex's parents try to talk to the school administration about the bullies at his school; however, they seem to do nothing as their concerns and pleas fall on deaf ears.  The Assistant Principal claims that the kids are good every time she is around them.  She is clearly oblivious to how kids can act when she is not around.We also see another victim of bullying in the movie, Kelly, age 16 who lived in Oklahoma and is a lesbian.  She dresses like a boy, acts like a boy, and she used to be a cutter and had tried to commit suicide on at least three different occasions.  She was bullied by both students and teachers because she lives in a small town and they don't agree with her lifestyle.  It got so bad to a point where her parents had to take her out of school.  Kelly now lives in a different town; however, she's still having a hard time getting people to accept her even though she has a small group of friends she hangs out with, which, she claims, helps her live every day.We then hear the story of another bullied girl, Jameya Jackson, 14 years old, who was an honor student.  She was bullied by 9-10 kids at school and it got so bad that she took a loaded gun to confront her bullies.  We see video footage of the moment she pulled the gun on the bus, which is chilling to see.  No shots were fired, but the situation could have easily been tragic in an instant.  Jameya had spent some time in juvie for the incident.Devon, age 14, is another child Bully talks to about his experiences being bullied by kids.  Devon claims that he had been bullied at school and he went off on someone and stood up for himself.  He says the bullying stopped after he confronted his bully and put them back in their place.  He has not had a problem with bullying since doing so.Later in the film, the filmmakers show video footage of Alex being bullied to his parents, who admitted they didn't think it was as bad as it showed in the film.  They then showed the video footage to the school.  After talking to Alex's parents, the Assistant Principal decides to put Alex on a different bus, thinking the bullying would stop.  It turns out, the bullying does continue even when Alex is on the different bus, so that was not a good solution.Bully is a film that needs to be seen by everyone, parents, students, teachers, advocates, and everyone in between.  This film does a great job capturing the hard times and some punishments that kids go through when being bullied.  The interviews with the victims are great to get a real perspective and the actual scope of the problem.  My overall rating for this film is 5/5 stars.  Although there is no instant solution to the problem of bullying, the least people can do is raise awareness of the problem.  The Bully Project, which was started because of this film, raises awareness and gives people a chance to tell their stories as well.  The website for The Bully Project is a place for information and resources on how you can talk with kids on the issue of bullying.Overall Rating:  5/5 Stars",5,Great First Person Accounts of Bullying

1451135,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B0059XTUH2,Erik North,"[0, 0]","It is one of those problems in American society that oftentimes doesn't get talked about by people in charge until it's too late.  The problem is school bullying.  It is a problem in which the victims are never given any support, where the perpetrators are not only often never punished but also sometimes even rewarded for their actions, and families of the victims often have to suffer in silence because, seemingly, no one in authority gives a damn.  The end result is either young kids who are ostracized to the point where they commit suicide, or put into such desperate straits that the only resort left open to them is to go on shooting sprees in which a lot of people die.  That is the subject explored in documentarian Lee Hirsch's compelling and very unnerving 2012 film BULLY.During a single school year, Hirsch and his film crew follow the lives of five families growing up in seemingly perfect small towns in the Midwest and the Deep South, who nevertheless have found their kids to be the target of bullies in school.  These are your basic all-American families in seemingly all-American small towns confronting what has become an all-American problem.  Their kids are often singled out for abuse of all kinds for various, unexplained reasons.  Some of it is physical, but much of the times, the abuse is verbal, and quite extreme at that.  Three of the five families suffer because the abuse against their children became so great that they felt they had no other choice but to end their lives.  One family confronts the fact that their child was pushed into a corner and threatened her tormentors with a gun.  Another family's child took proactive measures and encouraged other kids to stand up.  But whether the outcome was tragic, confused, or hopeful, they all had to confront something that is far too common in America, and has been that way for far too long: People, especially children, who are even slightly ""different"" in some way, whether they are socially distant, have learning disabilities, or are not of the right skin color or ethnicity in certain towns will be singled out; and those in authority will turn a blind eye, giving the bullies the right to sanction their victims.  It has become a critical epidemic in America, one unfortunately promulgated by ""heroes"" like General George S. Patton (""Americans love a winner, and will not tolerate a loser."") and NFL coach Vince Lombardi (""Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing"").People in authority, as the film shows, often don't take the kind of proactive steps to stop bullying that the parents of those victimized do, and thus seem to sanction the bullying--much of the times, that abuse is more verbal than physical, with the use of sexual, racial, and homophobic slurs.  And while Hirsch and his film crew focused on the Midwest and the Deep South, the truth is that this kind of bullying is an epidemic in all corners of America.  BULLY, however, is not so pessimistic as to wallow in the grotesque, although it has to focus on the grotesque at times for people to really stand up and care more than they have in the past.  We also see the parents of bullying victims standing up for themselves, alongside other parents whose kids may not have been the victims of bullying but who nevertheless empathize with those that are, and taking their case all the way to the state houses.  It's sad that it takes this kind of devastation to make politicians know what kind of a corrupt culture has been fostered in America that allows bullying to happen, but at least now they are on notice.BULLY, in essence, is a cinematic manifesto against a disgusting tradition in America culture that needs to be stopped.  And if it even slightly succeeds in making a dent in this ugly underbelly of American life, it will have done a huge amount of good.  It is an important film, a definite must-see, without question.",5,A Manifesto Against Bullying In America,1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,3894,"['one', 'problems', 'American', 'society', ""n't"", 'get', 'talked', 'people', 'charge', 'too', 'late', 'problem', 'school', 'bullying', 'problem', 'victims', 'are', 'never', 'given', 'support', 'where', 'perpetrators', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'often', 'never', 'punished', 'also', 'sometimes', 'even', 'rewarded', 'actions', 'families', 'victims', 'often', 'have', 'suffer', 'silence', 'seemingly', 'one', 'authority', 'damn', 'end', 'result', 'young', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'ostracized', 'point', 'where', 'commit', 'suicide', 'put', 'such', 'desperate', 'straits', 'only', 'resort', 'left', 'open', 'go', 'shooting', 'sprees', 'lot', 'people', 'die', 'subject', 'explored', 'documentarian', 'Lee', 'Hirsch', 'compelling', 'very', 'unnerving', '2012', 'film', 'BULLY.During', 'single', 'school', 'year', 'Hirsch', 'film', 'crew', 'follow', 'lives', 'five', 'families', 'growing', 'up', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'small', 'towns', 'Midwest', 'Deep', 'South', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'have', 'found', 'kids', 'be', 'target', 'bullies', 'school', 'are', 'basic', 'all-American', 'families', 'seemingly', 'all-American', 'small', 'towns', 'confronting', 'what', 'become', 'all-American', 'problem', 'kids', 'are', 'often', 'singled', 'out', 'abuse', 'kinds', 'various', 'unexplained', 'reasons', 'physical', 'much', 'times', 'abuse', 'verbal', 'quite', 'extreme', 'Three', 'five', 'families', 'suffer', 'abuse', 'children', 'became', 'so', 'great', 'felt', 'had', 'other', 'choice', 'end', 'lives', 'One', 'family', 'fact', 'child', 'was', 'pushed', 'corner', 'threatened', 'tormentors', 'gun', 'family', 'child', 'took', 'proactive', 'measures', 'encouraged', 'other', 'kids', 'stand', 'up', 'outcome', 'was', 'tragic', 'confused', 'hopeful', 'had', 'confront', 'something', 'far', 'too', 'common', 'America', 'been', 'way', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'People', 'especially', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'even', 'slightly', 'different', 'way', 'are', 'socially', 'distant', 'have', 'learning', 'disabilities', 'are', 'not', 'right', 'skin', 'color', 'ethnicity', 'certain', 'towns', 'will', 'be', 'singled', 'out', 'authority', 'will', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'giving', 'bullies', 'right', 'sanction', 'victims', 'become', 'critical', 'epidemic', 'America', 'one', 'unfortunately', 'promulgated', 'heroes', 'General', 'George', 'S.', 'Patton', 'Americans', 'love', 'winner', 'will', 'not', 'tolerate', 'loser', 'NFL', 'coach', 'Vince', 'Lombardi', 'Winning', ""n't"", 'everything', 'only', 'thing', '.People', 'authority', 'film', 'shows', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'kind', 'proactive', 'steps', 'stop', 'bullying', 'parents', 'victimized', 'do', 'thus', 'seem', 'sanction', 'bullying', 'much', 'times', 'abuse', 'more', 'verbal', 'physical', 'use', 'sexual', 'racial', 'homophobic', 'slurs', 'Hirsch', 'film', 'crew', 'focused', 'Midwest', 'Deep', 'South', 'truth', 'kind', 'bullying', 'epidemic', 'corners', 'America', 'BULLY', 'however', 'not', 'so', 'pessimistic', 'wallow', 'grotesque', 'focus', 'grotesque', 'times', 'people', 'really', 'stand', 'up', 'care', 'more', 'have', 'past', 'also', 'see', 'parents', 'bullying', 'victims', 'standing', 'up', 'alongside', 'other', 'parents', 'kids', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'victims', 'bullying', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'empathize', 'are', 'taking', 'case', 'way', 'state', 'houses', 'sad', 'kind', 'devastation', 'make', 'politicians', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'corrupt', 'culture', 'been', 'fostered', 'America', 'bullying', 'happen', 'least', 'now', 'are', 'notice.BULLY', 'essence', 'cinematic', 'manifesto', 'disgusting', 'tradition', 'America', 'culture', 'be', 'stopped', 'even', 'slightly', 'making', 'dent', 'ugly', 'underbelly', 'American', 'life', 'will', 'have', 'done', 'huge', 'amount', 'good', 'important', 'film', 'definite', 'must-see', 'question']",The Bully Project
1451136,AQMZ9N7NAIPC,B0059XTUH2,"E. Selvia ""Liz""","[1, 1]","Well, this film is nothing if not timely. Just seeing the reactions of the parents of the victims is proof enough of that. Unfortunately, what I see here are a lot of lofty platitudes and little action. It is doubtless that what each of these children are experiencing is nothing short of assault and battery, harassment, stalking, theft, and death threats that would get any adult thrown in jail. But therein lies the problem. Children aren't treated like people in this country. They are either vaunted as being blameless ""little angels"" (by the principal who actually sees these kids being bad and turns a blind eye) or treated like someone else's burden. What I believe is the larger issue here (the elephant in the room, if you will) is that there simply is nothing that anyone can do to stop bullying in a country that admires bullying, be it financial, racial, or sexual. That is the real issue these parents need to be aware of. So long as those perpetrating the bullying are not subjected to the full legal ramifications of their actions that they would face if they were adults, it will never stop. If the parents here really want bullying to stop maybe they should start treating their kids like people instead of just little inconvenient burdens they have to deal with (I don't speak for all the parents when I say this but the guy blaming his own son for not being able to ""man up"" and somehow manage to physically defeat those subjecting him to brutal physical assault needs a vasectomy asap. Seriously, morons who treat their sons like that need to be sterilized.

1451139,A11SSYM4ISRN1I,B0059XTUH2,gclaheh,"[0, 4]","I wanted to write this review because I have a totally different opinion than many of the others who have written here.  First I want to say that I have been bullied as a kid, much worse than the gay girl and the girl who pulled a gun.  Kids would spit on me tag me and play the germs game, and would bully anyone who would try to be my friend.  When I was really little, I would cry in front of the whole classroom and then they would do things to make me cry.  As I got older, I started standing up for myself by insulting them back (and I fought dirty because I called fat girls FAT), and they stopped.  They never became my friends but they didn't insult me anymore.  I learned a lot of life lessons by being bullied that I have used as an adult.I actually think that the only thing that schools should do about bullies is to kick out the most violent kids.  What I mean by this is if a student frequently gets into fights constantly and most of the time it is his fault, he doesn't belong in a regular school.  On the flip side, I think that Alex probably shouldn't go to a public school until he can improve his social skills.  One of the boys who hit Alex said that Alex said something to him first and he was responding to it.  The other students have a right to sit quietly on the bus without being insulted by Alex.  I feel that the boys' reaction was way over the top, but I feel that Alex said or did something to those boys first.The two girls in the documentary and the two boys who killed themselves, I feel that their parents need to teach them how to cope with unkind people.  The lesbian girl who dresses like a boy and hugs her girlfriend really needs to tone it down a little and respect her classmates who do not accept the gay lifestyle.  If this girl continues this behavior, she will be very limited in her job choices because she makes people uncomfortable by the way she dresses and behaves.  You can't have the attitude that your rights are more important than everyone else's in the workplace; it is no different than a member of the KKK.  They would be told by management to tone it down or get out.  The girl who pulled a gun should learn different ways to cope with unkind people than pulling a gun out.  I work as a telemarketer and before that a customer service rep and if I carried on the way that these girls do everytime someone is rude to me on the phone, I wouldn't be able to last an hour.  Why didn't the two parents of the two boys who killed themselves teach their sons how to cope with mean people instead of expecting the school to do something?If the school gets involved in every students' conflict, these bullied students will never learn how to handle unkind people and conflict in their lives.  These students may become unemployable in the future because they will expect an authority figure to get involved with every conflict that they have instead of solving it themselves.

(There were a LOT of articles about the rating of this film as it was a big deal last year and received major media attention.) Thanks to the update by Brian Holst in the comments, the ""slight"" edit is apparently the bleeping of three of the film's six F-bombs, and that's it. The key scene where a girl is harassed on a bus was the major center of the MPAA controversy, and that scene is left completely intact.I believe that ""PG-13 Version"" is printed on the cover because the film makers want to make sure parents know about the rating and don't avoid renting or buying the disc.I still give 4 instead of 5 stars over a very stupid, pointless, and silly edit having to be made to the film over mostly political reasons.=========================(Original review text:Buyer beware: This is the PG-13 version of the movie.

1451142,AIO247KHD2O40,B0059XTUH2,James N Simpson,"[2, 6]","I think a lot of people are rating this five stars, simply due to it being on the side of antibullying, rather than how good the content of the film actually is and if it actually achieves any of the goals to lessen bullying in schools.  This film simply highlights the plights of a few children who are the victims of bullying, it does portray their hardships well, and you certainly feel sorry for them, especially the kid who is labelled Fishface by his peers, who more than half of the footage revolves around.  But that's pretty much all the film is, besides highlighting a few incompetent people running Fishface's school. It's not really much more than a YouTube video uploaded by some loser filming a student getting harassed or assaulted that goes for an hour and half instead of a minute or so.  Like those YouTube clips it doesn't provide any suggestions on what to do about the problem, we don't even have the camera guy ask the victims what do you think the schools could do that would actually work?  We never interview the bullies themselves after the incidents to get their side of the story, or to ask them why they felt a need to do what they did.There's areas of the film that have those watching screaming at the screen, in a loud voice the word what?  Such as a sheriff instead of addressing the actual crime of bringing a gun onto a bus to kill a bully or at least let him think that was a possibility. It's never really covered what her plan was.  Instead he decides to charge the girl with the kidnapping of 22 children even though clearly she wasn't going to kidnap anyone, and he then tells the camera she could have got a life sentence for each of those ridiculous charges when later we are told a judge as you would expect threw them out at court.  A principal tells a bully and the victim to shake hands (fair enough) but then is oblivious to the fact the bully is not being sincere and tells off the victim for not wanting to in front of him. Then we have the vice principal, after the violent bus scenes are shown to her with Fishface and his mother in her office, when the frustrated victim of the assault mentions he told her about a prior incident on the bus and she has done nothing, decide to instead of reassuring him well I'm going to do something now. She tells him off with a well has he ever shoved you under that seat again? No he hasn't has he, so you're lying, I did do something didn't I.  That's like saying has he ever stabbed you again with that pen? He used a pencil this time didn't he, well that proves I've done my job doesn't it. At no time does the camera reporter guy ever pull these adults up afterwards and bring those ridiculous comments/actions up for those who said them to explain and justify. Or perhaps he did but they weren't included.We miss huge opportunities for the film to go in a direction with the gun on the bus girl such as if she had actually shot someone or a few students would we still be looking at her as a victim, or would she in fact be seen in the same villain light as those students who have shot up schools? Fishface's in particular parent's actions are never questioned.  Why do they think forcing him to relive every incident of bullying that happened to him each day will help him?  Why don't they just buy him a bike so he doesn't have to catch the bus for that matter? Why they don't force him to join into some sort of after school/weekend activity sport or hobby wise that he has an interested in, so he learns to interact with people and can find those around his age with a similar interest? Maybe some of the other kids who attend those things go to his school. The serious issue brought up by his little sister that she is already starting to get bullied at school because he isn't standing up for himself and obviously they think she'll be like him is not addressed at all after that.  A gay student tells us a van deliberately ran her over when she was in the middle of the road and this is somehow part of the problem of bullying instead of an attempted murder hate crime? The filmmakers never brought up the fact that when all these incidents occurred none of the other kids spoke up or did anything to stop the assaults or verbal bullying which you'd think this would be the most important message for students watching this DVD after seeing actual incidents of bullying on the screen.The lack of suggestions on what can schools in general really can do about this issue is what really brings this film down. We aren't shown any footage of successful actions by schools tackling similar incidents shown in the film to learn from them.  Sure at the end the parents of kids who have taken their lives suggest everyone should go up to someone sitting by themselves with no friends and talk to them but that's it.  Nothing is suggested to Fishface or the other victims on what to do to make themselves less of a target or simply how to make friends. What are these victims going to do when school is over and they get a job?  Bullying still occurs in the workplace, especially in entry level jobs, how are they going to make sure they aren't victim's there as well?",3,Pretty Average Documentary Really,1367107200,"04 28,

1451143,A10H47FMW8NHII,B0059XTUH2,"Jay B. Lane ""professional audience member""","[9, 13]","Let's address an important issue. The MPAA ""R"" rating on this film (for six F-words spewed by school children in hate-filled diatribes) would have made it impossible for school children to see the tragic results of their venom. Filmmakers Lee Hirsch and Cynthia Lowen hoped to create a teaching moment and generate public outrage about unchecked bullying which turns schools into torture chambers for the underdogs who are targeted. Make no mistake, bullying has gone on since time eternal, but the vile that erupts from today's bullies is an eye-opener (those notorious F-words are the least of it!).Hollywood's movie rating board consistently yields to the deep pockets of the big studios; allowing students to attend violent, bloody, profane films, because they are blockbusters, while this worthwhile little documentary lacks those big deep pockets...more bullying?This time the little guy fought back. Instead of releasing this film unrated, which would have forced theater owners to treat it like a PG-17, canny Distributor Harvey Weinstein and theater owners have negotiated a truce with the MPAA, removed a token offensive word or two and the film will be treated like a PG-13!I beg anyone in the education system to PLEASE watch this movie. I realize that bullying is as old as time. I was stoned on my way home from school after our family moved to a new town, so I know from personal experience what it feels like. However, I was never subjected to the unrelenting humiliation children experience today. If you can watch how his classmates treat ""Fish Face"" and not cringe, you have a heart of stone. And in my opinion, that sheriff who arrested the anguished girl with the gun was probably the biggest bully on the playground when he was a boy! We examine the lives of five victims, two of whom are already dead, suicides as a result of bullying.Most of us have personally been confronted by the issue: many of us were bullied; many of us were witnesses; few escaped unscathed. To me, the most unsettling thing was to see (and hear) just how truly vile the school children are in today's schools. And our screening audience groaned aloud as we watched inept teachers and principals sweep it under the rug.Yes, yes. I am aware of the ""helicopter parents,"" who hover over their darlings, aided and abetted by lawyers, always trolling for lawsuits. This system has stripped bus drivers of the authority to eject a bully from a bus and turned school administrators into wimps.In my opinion, schools should teach children to automatically shun a bully, making it clear that his behavior is neither acceptable nor admired. If a bully doesn't have an audience, he will probably lose his motivation to dominate a classmate. The bully should be the pariah in school, not the poor kid who has always been the target. And yes, I've left parents out of the equation. If they were doing a decent job, bullying wouldn't exist!My thanks to Harvey Weinstein for standing his ground.

1451159,AMNLGCD1YISR4,B0059XTUH2,Nicole Garrett,"[0, 0]","I watched this documentary wondering what, if anything, can be done about bullying? Because many of the officials spoken to in this film, seemed to be at a loss about what to do.There were certain things that weren't said in this film, that needed saying. First, I do not think many of the school officials shown, were being purposely obtuse. I don't think they don't care. I don't think the bus drivers don't care either. I think we live in a truly heinous, pop cultured society, mixed with technology, that can make a well meaning person look like the bad guy. How many times have you seen on your local news, a bus driver taken to task for trying to stop some incident on a bus? Next thing he or she knows, they're on the nightly news or Youtube, and they are not depicted as having tried to help out. They're made to look as if they roughed up one of the kids, or worse yet, touched them inappropriately. I suspect that that is just one reason why the people parents look to, to keep the peace when bullying gets out of hand, look the other way.Secondly, while the rallies and gatherings were touching, where were all of these people when these young kids were suffering horribly? Where were they? The kids that took their lives, might have thought twice if they knew so many people had actually cared. Then again, maybe that is a lesson to be taken away from this. Step up and help out before bullying goes too far.Alex's problems were the most heartbreaking. His parents were well meaning(or thought they were), but how would their son be expected to deal with a situation like this, without some guidance? And poor Ja'Maya. Bullied and living in Mississippi. I thought that police official was the stereotypical, backwater sheriff, or whatever he was. His lack of empathy, I thought, was truly racist. Truly. Because I had no doubt, that if Ja'Maya had been White, and on a bus with that same crowd of Black kids, going through the exact situation, he could've found a way to understand why Ja'Maya had done what she did.What was missing from this documentary, and understandably so(they'd be stupid for showing their faces on camera), were the points of view from the parents of the bullies. Why do they think it's alright that their kids are terrorizing other children? I think one thing that would go a long way in helping, is if God forbid, one of these damned parents of these little animals, when confronted about what their child was doing, would just acknowledge that their child was wrong and make it clear to them that their behavior is unacceptable.But that doesn't happen. The parents of these heathens come into a principal's office or confront some other public official, with both barrels blazing, acting is if their child is being framed or something.I fear that something that was said by one of the parents, who's son committed suicide, said it best: it is going to take the child of someone 'important' or 'famous' to suffer from bullying and possibly take their own life, until something substantial is actually done about this problem.",5,Some People Are Animals,1368316800,"05 12, 2013",2013,3063,"['watched', 'documentary', 'wondering', 'what', 'anything', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'bullying', 'many', 'officials', 'spoken', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'loss', 'what', 'do.There', 'were', 'certain', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'said', 'film', 'needed', 'saying', 'First', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'many', 'school', 'officials', 'shown', 'were', 'being', 'purposely', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'bus', 'drivers', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'either', 'think', 'live', 'truly', 'heinous', 'pop', 'cultured', 'society', 'mixed', 'technology', 'can', 'make', 'well', 'meaning', 'person', 'look', 'bad', 'guy', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'local', 'news', 'bus', 'driver', 'taken', 'task', 'trying', 'stop', 'incident', 'bus', 'Next', 'thing', ""'re"", 'nightly', 'news', 'Youtube', 'are', 'not', 'depicted', 'having', 'tried', 'help', 'out', ""'re"", 'made', 'look', 'roughed', 'up', 'one', 'kids', 'worse', 'yet', 'touched', 'inappropriately', 'suspect', 'just', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'people', 'parents', 'look', 'keep', 'peace', 'when', 'bullying', 'hand', 'look', 'other', 'way.Secondly', 'rallies', 'gatherings', 'were', 'touching', 'where', 'were', 'people', 'when', 'young', 'kids', 'were', 'suffering', 'horribly', 'Where', 'were', 'kids', 'took', 'lives', 'might', 'have', 'thought', 'twice', 'knew', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'had', 'actually', 'cared', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'lesson', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'Step', 'up', 'help', 'out', 'bullying', 'too', 'far.Alex', 'problems', 'were', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'parents', 'were', 'well', 'meaning', 'thought', 'were', 'how', 'would', 'son', 'be', 'expected', 'deal', 'situation', 'guidance', 'poor', ""Ja'Maya"", 'Bullied', 'living', 'Mississippi', 'thought', 'police', 'official', 'was', 'stereotypical', 'backwater', 'sheriff', 'whatever', 'was', 'lack', 'empathy', 'thought', 'was', 'truly', 'racist', 'Truly', 'had', 'doubt', ""Ja'Maya"", 'had', 'been', 'White', 'bus', 'same', 'crowd', 'Black', 'kids', 'going', 'exact', 'situation', 'could', ""'ve"", 'found', 'way', 'understand', 'why', ""Ja'Maya"", 'had', 'done', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'documentary', 'understandably', 'so', ""'d"", 'be', 'stupid', 'showing', 'camera', 'were', 'points', 'view', 'parents', 'bullies', 'Why', 'do', 'think', 'alright', 'kids', 'are', 'terrorizing', 'other', 'children', 'think', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'helping', 'God', 'forbid', 'one', 'damned', 'parents', 'little', 'animals', 'when', 'confronted', 'what', 'child', 'was', 'doing', 'would', 'just', 'acknowledge', 'child', 'was', 'wrong', 'make', 'clear', 'behavior', 'unacceptable.But', ""n't"", 'happen', 'parents', 'heathens', 'come', 'principal', 'office', 'confront', 'other', 'public', 'official', 'barrels', 'blazing', 'acting', 'child', 'being', 'framed', 'something.I', 'fear', 'something', 'was', 'said', 'one', 'parents', 'who', 'son', 'committed', 'suicide', 'said', 'best', 'going', 'take', 'child', 'someone', ""'important"", ""'famous"", 'suffer', 'bullying', 'possibly', 'take', 'own', 'life', 'something', 'substantial', 'actually', 'done', 'problem']",The Bully Project

The movie basically follows 5 students in schools in Georgia, Iowa, Texas, Mississippi and Oklahoma as they deal with bullying in an almost daily basis, some with tragic results. There is a lot of footage from school buses, which appears to be ground zero for bullying. I assume Hirsch was able to mount some cameras in the bus unbeknowst to the kids. What we see is sometimes shocking. In the case of 12 yr. old Alex, the bullying becomes so violent that in the middle of the movie, we are informed that the film producers were so concerned with Alex's safety that they decided to share the school bus footage with Alex's parents and also with his school principal. Next we see the parents meeting with the school's Assistant Principal, who informs the parents that she is familiar with bus 54 (the bus Alex takes) and has done that route herself on occasion and ""these kids are good as gold"" (as you cam imagine, the theatre audience I was watching this with let out a huge moan at that point). Indeed, throughout the film, school administrations seemingly do little or nothing, or are in complete denial, or both. Just outrageous. Back to the rating of the movie: the MPAA simply made itself look like a buffoon by giving this movie an R rating, when in reality this movie should be watched by every single kid in America 10 years and older. The movie's rating eventually was given a PG-13 rating (in contrast, in Canada the movie was rated PG).I saw this movie this weekend at the Esquire Theatre here in Cincinnati, at a private screening by the Council on Child Abuse (COCA).

That said ""Bully"" takes a gut wrenching and heart shattering look into the daily lives of children who face an onslaught of terror every day at school. The documentary is fearless as are the children who willingly participated in showing to the world their greatest source of pain and self shame.What I found infuriating was the cavalier ""boys will be boys"" attitude that was so prevalent among the teachers, administrators, principles and even the bus drivers who turned a blind eye when a child was being abused. In one horrific scene a young boy is being repeatedly punched, stabbed with pencils, choked, called names and verbally humiliated - all in view of not just the other children but the bus driver who says and does absolutely nothing.And we see this behavior over and over again throughout the film.In one case a friendless young boy whose bullying by his tormentors is relentless is told by his father to ""stop being a pussy, to be a man to fight back"" he points to his little sister and says how will you defend her when the kids at school pick on her because you're her brother when you can't even defend yourself""School officials aren't much better - in yet another extremely disturbing scene a school administrator calls two boys inside who had been fighting. It's clear to anyone with a brain cell still kicking that the boy whose so very glib and all smiles and at her request  immediately puts out his hand to shake and make up with the other child who seems a shaken shell of what he should be.We of course know this is the bullied child, he's been down this road before with the other child, every day this other boy seeks him out and he tells this woman this but it falls on deaf ears. We see her many times through out the film and like the majority of ""professionals"" whose job is not just to educate our children but to protect them flat out ignore what they see.Bully definitely asks more questions then offers answers, but it is none the less a wake up call or at least it should be. But then we live in  a world where in an epidemic of Gay youth suicides there's Pope spewing cruel and evil homophobic rhetoric.""Bullied"" would have been a better title because we never get a glimpse of what makes a kid bully other children. The film never explores for a moment the home lives of abusive kids we only bare witness to the wake of misery they leave behind.They are phantoms - and they shouldn't be.I think as a society we're going to have to look at that and look deeply if we're ever going to stop this torment. Because that's where the answers are.

What's perhaps even more shocking than the bullying acts depicted though is the jaw dropping cluelessness of many of the school administrators.  As I was watching this doc, I formed some choice words for the completely inept Vice Principal of the school Alex attended.  The scene where this she-imbecile is talking to Alex's parents in her office and she just suddenly stops listening to their serious problem and starts talking about her own grandchildren out of the blue as if this poor family's problems mean nothing to her was absolutely jaw dropping.  The complete insensitivity to the problem this woman showed (and displayed in other events as well) is completely mind blowing.  I sincerely hope that hopelessly incompetent woman lost her job after this doc came out.  Bullying is a huge problem, myself and my best friend were bullied in school. Like so many of today's kids-I tried to get help and like so many of them my pleas went unheard-simply falling on the deaf ears of administrators who did not care enough to step in and get involved.  I sure hope this documentary opens a few eyes.  It's heartbreaking to watch these kids get repeatedly psychologically damaged on a daily basis.  And that's exactly what bullying is-psychological damage.  We need to get involved and protect our kids.

1451163,A28CZE6LSQ9SL3,B0059XTUH2,ReCynd,"[2, 2]","Trying to rate this film using the star system is difficult and misleading: if I were judging the film's effectiveness in portraying how vicious kids can be to each other, how damaging bullying can be to one's self-esteem, or how generally inept school officials are, I would give it a resounding five stars.My main problem with this film is that it identifies bullying as the underlying problem, and demands that the same system that has created these soulless little monsters do SOMETHING--anything!--to fix the problem.  Meanwhile, children suffer and parents wring their hands.It broke my heart to watch the abuse the children in this film endured, and I cried for the parents who lost their children to suicide.  However, the blame must be placed where it belongs: squarely on the shoulders of those very parents.  It was THEIR job to protect their children, and for whatever reason, they did not do it.  No child should be allowed to suffer daily torment...but it is not up to the government to see that this doesn't happen, it is the parents' responsibility.  Why do we, as parents, expect someone ELSE to do this job?Rather than expending energy trying to fix a system that is defective at its core, we need to be fighting to change state laws that require mandatory school attendance and restrict parents' rights to care for their own children, including the responsibility for educating them however they see fit.The State has convinced most of us that we are incapable of adequately educating our children.  THIS IS A LIE!  Just look at what the schools are actually teaching: conformity, passivity, and deference to authority, and at the same time fostering aggression, frustration, and anger.  Schools (even the best ones) provide an environment frighteningly similar to prison, with a dangerous and powerful &#34;upper-class&#34; that uses its power to beat down the most vulnerable, those who need the most care and protection.  Why would we subject our children to this often-arbitrary and always capricious system?  For the &#34;education&#34; it provides?  Many kids leave school without being able to read, and those that can often choose never to pick up a book again!  Many college students can't name the two political parties, or the two countries that border the U.S., and many college graduates are not able to procure employment in their field of study...and often don't know any more than when they started school.Before anyone gets riled up, I am not suggesting that schools should be abolished totally, but they should be used only as a last resort.Bullies aren't the problem, they are a symptom of the problem.  The REAL problem is that we have handed our parental power and responsibility over to a governmental system that does not have--nor will ever have--our individual well-being as its priority.",3,BULLIES AREN'T THE PROBLEM--THEY'RE A SYMPTOM OF THE PROBLEM,1383782400,"11 7, 2013",2013,2832,"['Trying', 'rate', 'film', 'using', 'star', 'system', 'difficult', 'misleading', 'were', 'judging', 'film', 'effectiveness', 'portraying', 'how', 'vicious', 'kids', 'can', 'be', 'other', 'how', 'damaging', 'bullying', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'self-esteem', 'how', 'generally', 'inept', 'school', 'officials', 'are', 'would', 'give', 'resounding', 'five', 'stars.My', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'bullying', 'underlying', 'problem', 'same', 'system', 'created', 'soulless', 'little', 'monsters', 'do', 'SOMETHING', 'anything', 'fix', 'problem', 'Meanwhile', 'children', 'suffer', 'parents', 'wring', 'hands.It', 'broke', 'heart', 'watch', 'abuse', 'children', 'film', 'endured', 'cried', 'parents', 'who', 'lost', 'children', 'suicide', 'However', 'blame', 'must', 'be', 'placed', 'where', 'squarely', 'shoulders', 'very', 'parents', 'was', 'THEIR', 'job', 'protect', 'children', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'child', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'suffer', 'daily', 'torment', 'not', 'up', 'government', 'see', ""n't"", 'happen', 'parents', 'responsibility', 'Why', 'do', 'parents', 'expect', 'someone', 'ELSE', 'do', 'job', 'Rather', 'expending', 'energy', 'trying', 'fix', 'system', 'defective', 'core', 'need', 'be', 'fighting', 'change', 'state', 'laws', 'require', 'mandatory', 'school', 'attendance', 'restrict', 'parents', 'rights', 'care', 'own', 'children', 'including', 'responsibility', 'educating', 'however', 'see', 'fit.The', 'State', 'convinced', 'most', 'are', 'incapable', 'adequately', 'educating', 'children', 'THIS', 'LIE', 'Just', 'look', 'what', 'schools', 'are', 'actually', 'teaching', 'conformity', 'passivity', 'deference', 'authority', 'same', 'time', 'fostering', 'aggression', 'frustration', 'anger', 'Schools', 'even', 'best', 'ones', 'provide', 'environment', 'frighteningly', 'similar', 'prison', 'dangerous', 'powerful', '34', 'upper-class', '34', 'power', 'beat', 'down', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'who', 'need', 'most', 'care', 'protection', 'Why', 'would', 'subject', 'children', 'often-arbitrary', 'always', 'capricious', 'system', '34', 'education', '34', 'Many', 'kids', 'leave', 'school', 'being', 'able', 'read', 'can', 'often', 'choose', 'never', 'pick', 'up', 'book', 'again', 'Many', 'college', 'students', 'ca', ""n't"", 'name', 'two', 'political', 'parties', 'two', 'countries', 'border', 'U.S.', 'many', 'college', 'graduates', 'are', 'not', 'able', 'procure', 'employment', 'field', 'study', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'more', 'when', 'started', 'school.Before', 'anyone', 'riled', 'up', 'am', 'not', 'suggesting', 'schools', 'should', 'be', 'abolished', 'totally', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'only', 'last', 'resort.Bullies', 'are', ""n't"", 'problem', 'are', 'symptom', 'problem', 'REAL', 'problem', 'have', 'handed', 'parental', 'power', 'responsibility', 'governmental', 'system', 'not', 'have', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'individual', 'well-being', 'priority']",The Bully Project

1451166,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0059XTUH2,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Bully (Lee Hirsch, 2011)[NOTE: this entire review can be construed to contain spoilers, if that word has any meaning when one is discussing a documentary. Proceed with caution.]I don't quite know how to review Bully. My proposed method of dealing with many of this film's subjects could possibly, if I aired it here, be considered advocating violence. (And it is.) That's not something you're supposed to do these days. After all, consider the fate of Ja'Meya Jackson, one of the five teens in this movie who fall into the category of what Jean Shepherd called &#8220;the nameless rabble of victims&#8221;. She was bullied, she decided to do something about it, and not only did she get arrested and sent for psychiatric evaluation, but director Lee Hirsch leveraged the incident to include one of the movie's most startling, offensive interviews, in which an adult who obviously has no memory of his own school days says he cannot imagine there being justification for Jackson's actions unless the other kids were &#8220;beating her in the head every day.&#8221; How much do you want to bet this idiot was a bully himself, back in the day? And in the interests of full disclosure, I'll tell you this: I was in high school quite a while ago (I graduated in 1986), when things were a little more relaxed than they are now vis-a-vis what you could and could not have with you in school. You know that scene in one of S. E. Hinton's novels where the main character mentions the scalpel he was using in science class was too dull, so he pulled out a switchblade to open up a worm, and the reaction of the kids around him was not &#8220;OH [censored for Amazon consumption] THIS KID HAS A SWITCHBLADE!!!&#8221; but &#8220;wow, you really are a hoodlum&#8221;? Things weren't that relaxed by the early eighties&#8212;I would have been sent to detention had I been found out&#8212;but I too was one of that nameless rabble of victims, and for three of my high school years I carried either a stiletto or a butterfly knife with me every. single. day. Why? Because I had a knife pulled on me by a bully in eighth grade, and I was lucky to get away with the small amount of blood he drew. This is not a new problem, and all that we've managed to do in the intervening quarter century is make bullying easier and more pervasive by taking away every tool the victims have to defend themselves. Someone turning a camera on this problem was long overdue. Lee Hirsch finally did it, and what I saw didn't change my views on how to deal with bullies one iota, save to reaffirm them something fierce.The main problem with Bully&#8212;and I use the term &#8220;problem&#8221; perhaps in a nitpicky sense, though seeing how things would have gone had Hirsch taken this approach would have been interesting indeed&#8212;is that Lee Hirsch is not Frederick Wiseman. In Wiseman's classic muckraker Titicut Follies, Wiseman got the shocking footage he did because he and his crew stayed at the facility for so long that they eventually, to the guards, became as visible as potted plants, and this allowed Wiseman to capture things on tape that no thinking human being would ever consider doing in the light, much less on film. Hirsch and his crew never achieved that level of invisibility, and if I had to put money on it, I'd wager a year's pay that the actual bullying that got caught on tape is only the slightest tip of the iceberg. We hear much more about the bullying that goes on in high schools than we actually see, and as we all know, you can tell people things until they're blue in the face and the majority of them will simply not listen. If you really want someone to understand the depth of the problem, you have to show them that it exists. Hirsch does not do this, and to me, the movie suffers for it.This is not to say that what we get is not valuable, and the Ja'Meya Jackson story (and resultant school-official interview) I referenced above is worth the price of admission by itself, in that regard; I haven't checked, but I can't imagine that genius still has a job. If he does, that condemns the entire school board that employed him. Everything else to be found here is just bloody icing on a black-and-blue cake, and there's a whole lot of it.

Maybe more of his everyday struggles, and how he survived that school at his graduation.  He was a very frail boy and I could see how no matter what school he would go to, or even playing at the park after school, he would be a target.  His father was a clown expecting this weak kid, to take up arms against the bullies so that people would take him and his little sister seriously.  Really, dude?  You send your kid to school to let him fight alone?The gay chick (why are we even focusing on this minor's fornication?) seemed like she had no real bullying problems like Alex.  Yes, the people are being small-minded in her public school, but her parents could just as easily homeschool her, or put her in good school versus the mediocre one she was in.The black chick seemed to have the most compelling story, however there wasn't much of it in the film.

I wish all the kids in this film the best and hope they all are able to move on to a promising future like I have. Being bullied is like a version of emotional battery. Shame on all the teachers who tell students to ignore their bullies ! I understand  that teachers are not therapists, but they should have some common sense. The teachers in this movie are freaking stupid as hell! I wanted to throw a glass through my television when the teacher gave the  victim trouble for just repeating what his bully was doing and saying to him. I can't believe how moronic these teachers are! Anyways being bullied sucks, but it gives you an edge over those who had it easy! It's true that the best revenge is living well and from what I see on Facebook  the jerks are getting back what they deserve. They either are alcoholics  who are working on their second divorces or have given their life to religion to forget what horrible beings they really are.Also the parents in this film care about their kids and that is one good thing going for the victims. My parents were useless. They blamed the  bullying  I got on me saying that I was probably rolling my eyes too much or that kids are just having fun and that it is no big deal. Suffice to say I don't speak to my ""never should have been parents"" parents anymore. I blame them more than anyone else. They did nothing and instead laughed it off.

Director Lee Hirsch has filmed the lives of children (including 12 yr. old Alex) and their families that are struggling in the midst of indescribable suffering.  There is no acceptance of children that may or may not be different, no remorse for actions taken against them, and seemingly minimal help for aiding these situations where other children are the instigators themselves.Being ""victimized"" is what is being explored and is brutally displayed; this documentary is not for someone who wishes to simply be entertained, this is what hopefully builds advocacy.  Done with so much emotion and feeling, I could barely get through the painful viewing of this.  I found this running through my mind, over and over, and asking myself how this could still be ...It has gotten to the dire point, with some like Alex, that they are unaware of even being abused.  The descriptive expletives, used to scare and demean, are to a much more heightened degree and thrown around like idle quips while menacing another.  Suspicion, ""I see you guys laughing over there"", is pervasive for kids at school who are always on the lookout for the bully.  ""I feel like I belong somewhere else"" becomes the general consensus for the isolated and 'targets' of this behavior.  Suicide attempts and following through with it have become a viable option for our children ...The 'differences' that may be celebrated about us as adults are life changing and soul-damaging for a child.  If these things are even noticed in them, they are considered a 'weakness' and they become the target for the former said abuse.  This goes way beyond the old ""kids will be kids"" thinking, this is criminal on a scale that left my jaw dropped, right in the position that it started out in.An extremely painful and gut-wrenching documentary that possibly, if in the right hands, could make a difference.  It would be better served on the national level, although making its people aware is the start of any change.  I certainly hope that there is a follow-up made to this to show what, if anything, has changed since the time of filming this one.

All the incidents take place in small town communities. The student base is small and any new kid or different kid gets bullied. In larger schools there are abundant students that there are enough kids that don't fit in, that they can form friendships among themselves.In this film, all the kids that are bullied are different. They suffer from name calling and being ostracized. In some cases it is physical. The principal of the one school confronts the bullies and threatens to put a note in their permanent record if they don't stop. Now in my school, that wouldn't stop the bully.

It is ashame that nature has predisposed our species to be like all the other species in separating the weak elements of the pack. But as I see it bullying is like cancer. It is natural. It is easier to prevent than cure. And too many times things don't work out. But has society become bigger bullies than when I was a kid? Or my grandparents? Or is the fact everyone owns a camera and films aspects of our life we wouldn't normally want filmed? There is no mention of the adolescent brain development which leads to undesirable traits.My heart goes out for these kids, especially Fish Face. Growing up, I would sooner eat poop and get the crap beat out of me than to tell someone it happened. But to capture it on film and then complain to adults? They will all regret they made this stupid film as will everyone else who puts their stupidity on U-Tube for all to see. I would sooner take my chances by giving the bully a swift hard kick to the nads when he didn't expect it.Because of the topic everyone will ooh and aah over how important it is to see this film. The most powerful and disturbing thing about this film are people who find it powerful and disturbing. It interlaces home movies with shot footage. So if you are a kid getting bullied, what you really need to make yourself fit in is to have a camera man, boom man, director and producer follow you around and film you on the school bus. That will rate a shot to the head. I didn't find it informative or moving. I went to school once myself. It is not just a red state Bible Belt issue like the film seems to imply in one episode. It's life. Deal with it.Parental guide: F-bombs (spoken and written at beginning of film) no sex or nudity.

There is no ""law"" that can be made to end this. What we have here is proof of several things, the most glaring are the following two, which should have been delved into by the film:1.The semi-psychotic Asst. Principals and School Superintendants, all eager to say to bully and victim, ""shake hands, and be friends"" when their refusal-to-see-the-problem actually exacerbates the frustration in the bullied child. In one particular scene, the bullied child shows more insight and intelligence than the Asst Principal, a common occurance in todays schools.2.The parental cowardice that hangs like a pall over many of these children's lives is never even looked at. In one instance, the bullied child is subtly judged as inadequate by his own parents, and those same parents make no effort to actually prepare the child to stand up for himself; instead asking almost derisively, ""Do you like to get hit?"" If your kid starts lifting the most simple weights till the muscle ""burns,"" he'll add muscle very quickly. Just doing that can add confidence. Add to that the admonition that you're not made of glass, and maybe the bully can beat you up, but let him know you'll get in your punches too, and they'll stop picking on you. Somehow, this is never even mentioned.I raised 4 boys. One came to me admitting his fear of a bully. I explained a simple UNPLEASANT truth: ""Cowards die many times before their death; the valiant taste of death but once."" I told my son, ""it's OK to be scared, be aware that your knees are shaking, just curl your fingers into a fist so hard that when your fist starts to hurt so much you cant stand it, and at that point you drive your fist into the other boy's face."" He did exactly that (off school property) and never had another problem.Yes, it's a wonderful notion that all schoolchildren should rally together and help the bullied. I support that 110%, but the human being has to try to help himself. Whoever said friends and fitting-in is the be-all and end-all of all student life, anyway?  If the child - whether geeky or weak - stands up for himself, those are the cuts and bruises he can feel proud of, and guess what?

1451181,A1PL7QILVQV3IF,B0059XTUH2,"The Taminator ""There's no going back. You've ...","[39, 44]","My mom recently gave me a bag of papers, report cards and mementos from my school days. She meant it to be a nice thing for me to have in adulthood to remember my school days. People who want me to put the past behind me seem to also be the same people who won't let me forget it. I had to stuff that bag in the closet. I can't look at it without crying. Why were they so mean to me? Why was I such a bad person? Why did they hate me so much? I graduated high school in 1989, and the bullying I endured still hurts.If you're an adult survivor of the kind of heinous treatment the kids in this movie endure, it may trigger a PTSD episode. If it never happened to you, you will be absolutely stunned at what goes on. They don't sugar-coat anything. Some of the footage is raw and disturbing. These kids know that the cameras are there;  they've been recorded since before they were born. They know they are being watched, and they still behave like animals. It makes you really wonder what they do when they know no one is looking.It is kind of limited in scope. They never interview the bullies, so we never know why they think it's OK to treat other kids that way. It doesn't get much into cyber bullying. All of the stories are from small towns. I don't think they intentionally tried to smear small town America, but having one story from a major metropolitan school system would have been helpful. Where are school administrators who fight bullying? They're certainly not in this film, and after I watched it, I'm convinced they don't even exist.Alex stands out because they followed him around the most, yet they neglected to mention that he has Asperger Syndrome. With Kelby they mentioned she was gay almost every chance they had, but  Alex's autism was never mentioned.  Autistic people across the spectrum run a very high risk of being bullied, taken advantage of and being victim to criminal activity. Keeping autism cloaked in this movie was a horrendous disservice to Alex and to autistic people everywhere.Everyone is giving Alex a hard time. The kids literally pummel him with fists and words. The school administrators insist that he must have some part in how the other kids are treating him. He must have done something to provoke them. Even Alex's own parents blame him for not doing something about it, but they never explain WHAT he is supposed to do. Their only concern seems to be that his younger sister not be teased for having him as a brother. Alex is treated as a sub-standard human, as though he is less than anyone else, and it's sickening to watch.You'll be outraged at the other cases, too. Ja'Meya was bullied so much that she brought a gun on her school bus. The sheriff gets some kind of sick pleasure out of stacking as many felonies onto a bullied black girl as he can. I can only speculate what unspeakable things a man like this does in his patrol car back seat while flashing his emergency lights and watching re-runs of Beretta.Kids in a mini-van ran over Kelby because she is gay, and they call it bullying.  She's not welcome at church, and her teachers openly participate in the bullying and hate. She wanted to stay and try to make a difference and change the status quo, but even the strongest among us have their limits. After another humiliating incident, Kelby can't take any more, and decides it's time to go to another school.The film also discusses two boys who were bullied so badly they killed themselves. It's gut-wrenching to watch those parents grieve. The movie tries to end on a hopeful note, but it's really not enough. Letting balloons go into the sky won't stop bullying or cure the incompetence of the adults who are supposed to protect these kids. This movie's website doesn't do much, either. They sell DVDs, ""educator toolkits"" and ask visitors to take pledges against bullying. We are encouraged to throw money at the problem rather than solve it, because it's the American way. Everyone needs to see it, but thanks to the way they're distributing it, not everyone will.

1451182,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0059XTUH2,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[29, 39]","They say there is no such thing as bad publicity and if you are promoting a movie, that is generally the truth. Any publicity, any mention of your film will generally sell more tickets. Even if all of the mentions are negative, some people, all of the other 'thornhills' out there, will go to see what all of the bad word of mouth is about.But if the publicity is good, or unrelated to the quality of the film, the movie stands to gain from the attention. ""Bully"" is the latest example of a film receiving a lot of publicity and gaining viewers from this publicity. And that's a good thing, because the film needs to be seen by lots of people to get the message out to help anyone and everyone that could be affected by bullying.A brief recap. The film received an R-rating due to the use of the F-word a few times. Keep in mind; this is a documentary, so the footage shows real kids using this word in a negative way towards another kid. But if a film receives an 'R', many theater chains restrict access to the film. Worse yet, many schools would not be able to show the film, and use it as a learning tool. So the Weinstein Company decided to release the film 'Unrated'. Unfortunately, the major theater chains tend to restrict access to 'Unrated"" films, if they show them at all, even more than they would an 'R' rating. Generally, an ""Unrated"" film would or should receive an 'NC-17' or 'X' rating, ratings reserved for films with explicit sex. Thankfully, only one of the major chains refused to show the film. The others restricted their showings to a handful of theaters in major cities on the East and West Coasts. But word of mouth, protests and action by concerned viewers have helped to get this changed and the film is slowly expanding to more and more theaters.Great. That is one problem solved. But why did ""Bully"" get an 'R' rating initially when a film like ""Taken"" gets a 'PG-13'? This is part of an ongoing debate about the usefulness of the Ratings Board and all of their outdated (?) idiosyncrasies. Many have long decried the fact that the Ratings Board tends to look at scenes depicting intimacy between two consenting adults much more harshly than extremely violent fare. Essentially, they are making it easier to watch violence than to watch passion and love. I would prefer my own kids to see passion and love and be influenced by that rather than by excessive violence. But violence is apparently more acceptable and much more successful at the box office.That said, I think the ratings should be used as intended, as a guideline. When I was growing up my mother let me see practically any film I wanted to. And the simple reason for this is she knew I knew the films were not real. So I went to see horror films, adult themed dramas and R-rated comedies when I was young. If I ever saw anything that disturbed me, I knew it wasn't real so it didn't stay with me. If I needed to talk about it, I did. If your kid wants to see an R-rated film, ask them why. If you are satisfied with the answer, let them go. I have a friend who goes to an R-rated film his daughter wants to see first to see if there is anything that would disturb her. If he is okay with the film and thinks it will be OK for his daughter, he lets her go. When I asked if he was OK with a film containing excessive language, he said it didn't concern him as much as violence because he was sure his daughter heard worse on the schoolyard every day. Both good alternatives.""Bully"", directed and photographed by Lee Hirsch, concentrates on the stories of five pre-teen and teen boys and girls, all of whom are the victims of bullying at school. The overall power of a film like this depends on the emotional impact of each of the individual stories. All five are very moving, but they don't have the same impact and that creates an uneven viewing experience.Kelby is a teen girl who lives in a small town. When she realizes she is a lesbian and people in the town begin to find out, she and her family are virtually shut out by neighbors and lifelong friends. Her father offers to move the family, but Kelby doesn't want to give in. Kelby is a quiet young lady and doesn't talk a lot. The bulk of the story comes from listening to her dad talk about the effects of this news on their town, and how their friends and neighbors reacted. The majority of the time we spend with Kelby is spent with her and her friends, standing around, smiling, and goofing off. This story is interesting and moving, but more because of how her father relates affects of the bullying of his daughter to us. Obviously every kid is going to be different, but we need to hear the story from Kelby, to feel her emotion and how it changed her. Just watching her stand around and goof off with her friends doesn't accomplish this.Ja'Maya is a young girl who gets arrested because she acts out against the kids who were bullying her. Her mother fills us in on the details and the story moves forward from there. Again, the story is powerful, but we need to hear more from Ja'Maya. Or have more access to see how it changes her.These two stories, while powerful, just don't hit the same level of emotion of the other stories.The film centers on Alex, an awkward, slightly gawky pre-teen who is so desperate for friends that he comes to think of the kids who are bullying him as his friends. When his parents eventually discover the magnitude of the problem, he states that if the bullies stop, who will be his friends? It is a heart wrenching moment and you can see the pain in his mother's eyes. Alex doesn't quite seem to realize this is a problem and that sort of amplifies the emotion for us even more.The filmmakers are allowed access to Alex's bus and record a lot of footage of the other kids bullying him. When the problem gets out of hand, they show the footage to his parents and the people in charge of his school. His parents are mortified and arrange a meeting with the vice principal, a woman who is so out of touch she elicits groans from the audience. Before this meeting, the filmmakers follow her as she patrols the halls of the school. She watches as another young man is bullied and stops both kids, insisting they shake hands and make-up. When the victim won't, he wants nothing to do with the other kid; she turns on the victim and decides he needs to be disciplined. She goes so far as to say that because he wouldn't forgive the bully and shake his hand, he is as bad as the bully. Just when I thought my mouth couldn't hit the floor any faster, her meeting with Alex's parents just illustrates the full extent of her lack of empathy and awareness.Alex's story is very sad, and I have to admit that I felt more than a few parallels between our lives. The funny thing is that you just know Alex is going to grow up and completely change. His quirky look will deepen and probably develop into a handsome profile, giving him the looks of an Abercrombie & Fitch model. Isn't that how most movie stars and models got started? Aren't they always the fat kid or the awkward kid? Clearly, the parallels between our lives end there.The film opens with a father telling us the story of his teen son. As soon as he begins talking, and you realize where the story is headed, you will most likely start reaching for the hankies. Later, another father talks about the problems his son faced in school. In an effort to deal with his grief, he starts a campaign to bring attention to the problem, which begins to gain more members and public awareness, through social media efforts. Some of these group meetings are shown at the end of the filmAll of the stories told are powerful, but the two most predominant narratives really tug at your heart strings. Because the others aren't as powerful, the film feels a bit uneven and less-memorable.Also, I would really like to have seen the filmmakers tell the story of at least one kid from a big city. All of the subjects featured are from small towns in the Midwest and South. The problem doesn't exist in New York, Los Angeles or Chicago? Presenting a story from a big city, any big city, might have helped to make the film's message that the problem is universal seem more... universal.""Bully"" is not a perfect documentary or the most powerful documentary I have ever seen, but it is very good and presents a message that needs to be seen. Should be seen. Must be seen.""Bully"" is rated 'R' literally because of the F-word. Let's face it. Your kids hear this many times a day on the school yard. Isn't it better that they see a film that might open their eyes to a problem, might help them communicate with you about a problem, might help start a discussion  about a problem that seems to be pretty widespread?I would say ""Yes"".",4,A Must See...,1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,8747,"['say', 'such', 'thing', 'bad', 'publicity', 'are', 'promoting', 'movie', 'generally', 'truth', 'publicity',

1451186,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B0059XTUH2,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","Today kids are killing themselves and each other at an alarming rate. The one thing all these cases seem to have in common is bullying. There was bullying when I was a kid, but 3 PM meant the end of the trouble. We had the rest of the day, the weekend, and the summer to recover. The advent of social media and cell phones has made the respite obsolete, as now, bullies can torture their victims 24/7. Bully is an award winning documentary that looks at the problems of bullying and shows the effects it has on children's lives. What I like about this film is that it showed a whole group of students from different economic, social, and ethnic backgrounds. What I took away is that anyone who is even slightly different in anyway, could be a target. What I didn't like was the solutions the film offers. Their solution is to tell someone and to stand up for kids you see being bullied, but anyone who has been bullied will tell you that those are not good ideas. Often times telling someone will anger the bully and make it worse, and as for standing up for other kids, often times that makes someone who wasn't previous bullied, a target. I think the answer is two-fold, in that first, parents need to tell their kids, from a very earlier age, that being unique, different, and even weird are admirable qualities in a person. I also believe the schools need to be tougher, because honestly, does anyone really think that giving a bully detention, telling them they're not nice, and that their hurting other kids really does anything? I think bullies need a taste of their own medicine, to feel those powerful emotions for even for just one day.

Viewers are swiftly wrenched from this felicitous scene and thrust into the reality of school bullying, which resulted in his tragic and preventable suicide at the tender age of seventeen. Think it can't get any worse? You haven't seen anything yet.Following the travails and ordeals of several bullied teens and the impact it has on their families. The almost invariably callous denial by school officials is showcased for the world to see. At a press conference, unable to deny the existence of bullying as the scientific consensus is unable to deny the impact of anthropogenic global warming, a principal claims that her school is not a ""haven"" for bullies. It's reminiscent of the Catholic Church standing in adamant denial of the thousands of instances of child rape occurring under their noses and on their watch.Such willful and deceitful denial flies straight in the face of the evidence provided over the past year, including physical assault and threats. A sliver of merit that came forth from Tyler's suicide came in the form of other children willing to speak up and give a voice to Tyler and other children who were victimised at school. In some cases, children missed two or three days of school a week. Another aspect of denying the problem are the instances of attempted suicide, which are obviously far easier to cover up, especially if the weapon is confiscated by a ""concerned"" authority figure.The scene where a callous policeman dismisses psychological and emotional bullying as essentially harmless (those opinions are clearly implied in his indifferent attitude) compared to physical bullying is enraging, to say the least. I don't care that she brought a gun on a bus - that was over the top, but so was the way she was treated. Society is doomed to a deadly spiral when heartfelt pleas repeatedly fall on deaf ears. A pastor proselytising the joys in heaven that await all children who perish is no better.""Suck it up"" has got to be the least effective and most cruel mantras repeated by well-meaning but uneducated adults in this issue. Children cannot stand up for themselves unless they are loved, supported and taught about the importance of self-esteem, their value as a person. Without this vital foundation, it is all too easy for bullying to destroy lives and prevent children from coming anywhere close to their full potential, academically or otherwise.The most profound statement was uttered by Tyler's mother, and it cleaves right to the heart of the issue. ""It doesn't matter who their parents are. When they're at school, they should be safe. Period!"" Children are our future, and so long as quiet, introverted, gentle children are pushed by the wayside for violent and impulsive bullies to prosper, intimidate and dominate them, the United States will never claw itself out of the cesspool of despair and melancholy that ignorance and complacency has hurled it headlong inside.",5,Ostriches in the Sand,1365120000,"04 5, 2013",2013,3057,"['gripping', 'poignant', 'impactful', 'documentary', 'begins', 'most', 'innocuous', 'images', 'young', 'Tyler', 'playing', 'family', 'backyard', 'Viewers', 'are', 'swiftly', 'wrenched', 'felicitous', 'scene', 'thrust', 'reality', 'school', 'bullying', 'resulted', 'tragic', 'preventable', 'suicide', 'tender', 'age', 'seventeen', 'Think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'worse', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'yet.Following', 'travails', 'ordeals', 'several', 'bullied', 'teens', 'impact', 'families', 'almost', 'invariably', 'callous', 'denial', 'school', 'officials', 'showcased', 'world', 'see', 'press', 'conference', 'unable', 'deny', 'existence', 'bullying', 'scientific', 'consensus', 'unable', 'deny', 'impact', 'anthropogenic', 'global', 'warming', 'principal', 'school', 'not', 'haven', 'bullies', 'reminiscent', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'standing', 'adamant', 'denial', 'thousands', 'instances', 'child', 'rape', 'occurring', 'noses', 'watch.Such', 'willful', 'deceitful', 'denial', 'flies', 'straight', 'face', 'evidence', 'provided', 'past', 'year', 'including', 'physical', 'assault', 'threats', 'sliver', 'merit', 'came', 'forth', 'Tyler', 'suicide', 'came', 'form', 'other', 'children', 'willing', 'speak', 'up', 'give', 'voice', 'Tyler', 'other', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'victimised', 'school', 'cases', 'children', 'missed', 'two', 'three', 'days', 'school', 'week', 'aspect', 'denying', 'problem', 'are', 'instances', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'are', 'obviously', 'far', 'easier', 'cover', 'up', 'especially', 'weapon', 'confiscated', 'concerned', 'authority', 'figure.The', 'scene', 'where', 'callous', 'policeman', 'psychological', 'emotional', 'bullying', 'essentially', 'harmless', 'opinions', 'are', 'clearly', 'implied', 'indifferent', 'attitude', 'compared', 'physical', 'bullying', 'enraging', 'say', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'brought', 'gun', 'bus', 'was', 'top', 'so', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'treated', 'Society', 'doomed', 'deadly', 'spiral', 'when', 'heartfelt', 'pleas', 'repeatedly', 'fall', 'deaf', 'ears', 'pastor', 'proselytising', 'joys', 'heaven', 'await', 'children', 'who', 'perish', 'better', 'Suck', 'up', 'got', 'be', 'least', 'effective', 'most', 'cruel', 'mantras', 'repeated', 'well-meaning', 'uneducated', 'adults', 'issue', 'Children', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'are', 'loved', 'supported', 'taught', 'importance', 'self-esteem', 'value', 'person', 'vital', 'foundation', 'too', 'easy', 'bullying', 'destroy', 'lives', 'prevent', 'children', 'coming', 'anywhere', 'close', 'full', 'potential', 'academically', 'most', 'profound', 'statement', 'was', 'uttered', 'Tyler', 'mother', 'right', 'heart', 'issue', ""n't"", 'matter', 'who', 'parents', 'are', 'When', ""'re"", 'school', 'should', 'be', 'safe', 'Period', 'Children', 'are', 'future', 'so', 'long', 'quiet', 'introverted', 'gentle', 'children', 'are', 'pushed', 'wayside', 'violent', 'impulsive', 'bullies', 'prosper', 'intimidate', 'dominate', 'United', 'States', 'will', 'never', 'claw', 'cesspool', 'despair', 'melancholy', 'ignorance', 'complacency', 'hurled', 'headlong', 'inside']",The Bully Project
1451190,A2HSAKHC3IBRE6,B0059XTUH2,Wolfmist,"[1, 1]","Most of the stuff made to show kids at school about bullying has them rolling their eyes as adults who think they know what's cool and that kids will be into really haven't a clue. This was very moving. It didn't talk down to kids or adults. It didn't sugar coat. It shone a light on the realities. it showed what REALLY happens when you take a problem to the administration of the school. They give you some nonsense and send your kid right back out with no changes. Often the bullied child is blamed by adults and schools seem to think that a kid who says &#34;wow, I didn't know I hurt your feelings... I was just kidding around&#34; really actually isn't just saying that because the adult is standing there. It's insane to me to believe some adults don't know what is actually going to happen to the poor kid the minute there are no adults around.Parents have to teach their kids that it is OK to be who they are and that they don't have to fit in and that they do NOT have to take the kinds of nonsense we see in this film. Parents need to let the school know that if it does not stop, they will press charges themselves and will contact the local news about the school's lack of enforcement.More importantly, parents have to teach their kids to have compassion for other people and to treat them the way they would like to be treated. You don't have to be friendly with everyone but you do have to be polite. You don't have to like everyone, but you do have to be kind. You do have to stand up when you see something wrong is happening.Schools have to learn that kids from wealthy families are just as big a problem as kids from poor families and often times are worse but know better how to cover it up. It doesn't matter who your parents are if you are treating others badly. It doesn't matter if you are attractive if you are also a bully. Just because you are in the popular crowd, doesn't mean you are a nice kid.
