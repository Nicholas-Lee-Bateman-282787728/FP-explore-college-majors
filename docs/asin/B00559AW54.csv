1442321,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B00559AW54,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[1, 1]","This 2010 film from Spain will not be for those who enjoy the thrill and excitement of faster paced movies with more action.  It is a quiet, low-key, slow-paced film with metaphors, symbolism, and wisdom.  It is also about the circle of new life and death.A young woman, Marcela arrived in Spain and lives with her boyfriend in a shoddy one-room apartment.  Marcela is a few weeks pregnant.  Nelson, her boyfriend runs a ""recycled"" flower shop out of the home.  The flowers, of which we know of,  are stolen from a trash bin, and rejuvenated, kept in the refrigerator, separated and repackaged, aerosol sprayed and re-sold.When the refrigerator that houses the flowers breaks down, Marcela must locate  a job to pay for the installments.  She becomes caregiver for an old man who knows his time is up soon.  He spends time in bed completing a large puzzle of the sea.  He shares with Marcela his metaphor of how life is like a puzzle....and how we are given the pieces,  but it is we who are responsible of putting the pieces together.Then, the old man dies, and Marcela, desperately needing the income, does the unthinkable..... not reporting the death and keeping the body on the bed.The one person who learns of his death and the charade is the aging hooker who makes a weekly visit to service the old man.  The hooker and Marcela keep the secret going while befriending one another.As I mentioned earlier,  the symbolism reveals itself in the flowers which are classified as dead at one time, then revived, freshened up, aerosol sprayed to smell like flowers.  In turn, the man's body is dead, freshened up, smell erased by aerosol spray.We don't arrive with all the answers to the storyline, but we have enough to be satisfied that the film is very good!  In this film, you also see how a circle of dependency plays its role on our lives.Surprisingly, I realized that the actress Megaly Solier, who plays Marcela was the starring role in the Best foreign Film nominee, 2009 forMilk of Sorrow, which I deemed a rather strange but good film also.If you are new to Foreign Film, I suggest following the Film Movement movies that are brought to us via the distribution of award winning and foreign film movies.  Often, there are meaningful discussion guides.  I have seen many on their list, quality filming, quality directing, quality acting.  See this one, by director Fernando Le&oacute;n de Aranoa.......

1442322,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00559AW54,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","The Spanish film ""Amador"" by writer/director Fernando Leon de Aranoa is a surprisingly quiet commentary that touches on a number of social issues including poverty, immigration, and religion. It is methodically paced, thoughtful, and introspective. And though the film might be a bit slow for some viewers, I was never less than fascinated by the central conundrum that faces our heroine. In truth, I didn't know ANYTHING about the film before viewing it. I hadn't even read the description on the DVD case. So for me, I had zero expectations. In many ways, I think that made my experience all the more rewarding. I wasn't tipped off to the major plot development that was to drive the primary narrative, so when it all started unraveling--I was completely blown away. For my part, I won't reveal what happens. If you can avoid learning about the movie, I would definitely recommend doing so.""Amador"" features Marcela (nicely underplayed by Magaly Solier), a young immigrant struggling to get by. It's obvious she dreams of a better life, she is unhappy with her boyfriend and their flower-selling enterprise. But she's trapped as well. A secondary job providing home care for an elderly gentleman named Amador (Celso Bugallo) offers her a bit more freedom and financial independence. Their relationship plays out in a very interesting way, but as circumstances change--Marcela faces several extremely large moral decisions that affect her life and livelihood. Should she do what she knows is right? Should she do what seems practical? Should she try to get away with whatever she can? At every opportunity, Marcela's choices thwarted my expectations and yet seemed believable as well. What I didn't expect, however, was the underlying current of macabre humor as Marcela turns to both the church and a wizened prostitute for life counsel.In the end, I'd classify ""Amador"" under the genre of neorealism with its depiction of the challenges facing immigrants in contemporary Spain. It's not overtly political, though, it just tells a simple (but unorthodox) human story. And it is in this simplicity and straightforward storytelling that the film achieves its power. I think it is a film that deserves a more widespread audience as its themes are universal. So check it out, but try not to read all about it! Even the product description gives the plot twist away, so it's undoubtedly impossible to avoid. Personally, I liked not knowing where we were headed.

1442323,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00559AW54,Paul Allaer,"[0, 0]","&#34;Amador&#34; (2010 release from Spain; 112 min.) brings the story of Marcela, who is having a hard time making ends meet. Her husband Nelson sells &#34;second hand&#34; flowers and wants to buy a new fridge for storage purposes. He encourages Marcela to find a side job, which she does: taking care of an old man (Amador), whose daughter (and her husband) are preoccupied building a seaside resort. Marcela and the old man try to find a way to get along. Meanwhile, Marcela also finds out that she is pregnant. Then, about 45 min. into the movie, there is a major event. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is an outstanding and powerful emotional drama, showcasing Marcela's bleak existence and commensurate desperation. There are also a number of moral undercurrents in the movie, but to say much more would spoil fome of the plot, so I won't say more. Second, the performance of Magaly Solier  will absolutely blow you away. At one point in the movie, she reads a letter written by the old man, just watch that scene as she is overcome with emotion, and along the way we are too. Wow. Third, kudos to Spanish writer-director Fernando Le&oacute;n de Aranoa, who brings us the story with an astonishing attention to details, both in the story and in the direction.This movie was released in 2012 by Film Movement as part of their on-going releases of foreign and indie films. As usual, the DVD comes with a bonus shortie, and this time it's a gem: &#34;How It Ended&#34; (2011 from the USA; 18 min.), starring Debra Winger. I'm not going to spoil anything, just watch!
