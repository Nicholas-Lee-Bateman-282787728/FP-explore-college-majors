I expected it to be a stupid movie about the leads getting drunk and going crazy, but it's more than that. The way the movie is filmed, the way the characters think, makes you think about today's society and what are we doing with it. The movie is such a mind blowing experience that you can't stop watching it no matter what. James Franco was the best actor of this movie, his talent is undeniable and it's not absent in this movie. I also liked Ashley Benson's performance.I just think that Vanessa Hudgens should retire from acting. She was just plain annoying, and her character was a little robotic in my opinion, at least she should take some acting lessons. I'm just a little sad that this movie has three stars when it deserves five. People expected a movie full of nudity and the girls having fun, but that's not the case. Teens will not really enjoy it, they will found it boring, but in my experience, I found it amazing. Give it a chance, and you will love this movie.

I love this movie because it shows the dark side of an American Tradition as compared to MTV's one sided coverage of it for several years. I watched it 2x with no commentary then put on the commentary and it helped me appreciate this movie alot more. I have to give props to Vanessa Hudgens Candy and Ashley Benson Brit for really going for it in a pool scene, and also to Rachel Korine Cotty for the party scene. Faith (Selena Gomez's character) is pretty much a good girl throughout this movie but she does some of the best acting I have ever seen her do (only ref is Wizards of Waverly Place) especially in her scene with Franco in the back of the pool hall..  As for James Franco he was amazing, I wouldn't have known that Alien was James Franco if his name weren't billed as a star of the movie.

Even though, it does show a lot of girls, and guys, going wild that's not what the movie is about. Three of the 4 girls are morally irreprehensible characters to varying degrees, if that's possible. Much of what they do boggles the mind. Then again, in retrospect, that may have been the point of the movie after all. A subtitle for this movie could be: &#34;F-Bomb Gone Wild&#34;, especially as it relates to the James Franco character. I'm no prude by any means, but what was the point of that?Understandably, many movies require a certain level of &#34;suspension of belief&#34;. If the movie is good, one can easily do that.

1633067,A1N00127IDBHD6,B00BEJL4RO,CConn,"[2, 5]","Upon first impression, Spring Breakers will,  to its detriment, always appear to be little more than a tasteless exploitation of its cast of overly willing ex-Disney channel teens. Which is a shame as the film - at very least - attempts to achieve at least some level of profound introspection and commentary.The film can best be described as a present day take on A Clockwork Orange; exaggerating and parodying the flaws of our American youth, highlighting the all too realistic melding of childish ignorance and a world of very real and very ugly landscapeof crime, violence and sex.Despite his lofty aspirations, to be perfectly honest, writer/director Haromy Korine simply doesn't appear to have the talent or skill to make the most of his story, and while the concept is consistently strong, and his desire to prove his overall point is always evident, his script lacks the ingenuity and vigor to make a name for itself as a film people will talk about for years to come.Still, there is plenty to like about the film as well. While obviously not the best writer in the business, Korine most certainly is an extremely skilled and intelligent director, and through his knowledge of the art, he's able to turn his film into an eery yet beauty dreamscape. Through insightful editing and use of music and sound, the movie always maintains an extremely lucid and serene tone, as if nothing we're seeing is reality, but is rather the warped and quite obviously untrue perception of our main characters.The creation of this atmosphere lends itself greatly to the overall characterization of its characters and girls who are most definitely quite wholly vapid and obnoxious are, at least, humanized and we can, at least, begin to understand their motivations and actions.Which, again, is a very intelligent method of characterization and expression of theme. A lesser director could have easily fallen into the trap of attempting to detail his thematic intent through heavy handed dialogue or entirely unlikeable characters, but Korine avoids those usual pitfalls.The other consistently noticeable and impressive aspects of the film is its cinematography and color palette. I can't say it enough, it's a beautifully shot film. Maybe not one of the best I've ever seen, but Korine's use of the bright neons of beachwear and nightlife combined with Florida's naturally gorgeous geography make for an impressing melding of the artificial and vibrant and the serene and subdued.In terms of the cast, it's only Gomez and Franco who turn in memorable performances. Gomez's strength comes from her seemingly natural born innocence and childlike moral fortitude, with one tear-filled scene acting as a crescendo for her entire performance. It won't win any Oscars, but it's solid nevertheless. For Franco, his ability to so drastically morph and envelop himself into his role as a south Florida ganger wannabe is incredible. Again, he maintains a constant balance of tongue-in-cheek humor and underlying condemnation of the real life people and culture he mimics in the film.Overall, Spring Breakers is not a movie for everyone. If you're paramount concern with a film is deft scripting and likable characters, Spring Breakers will probably come off as rather wholly loathsome. But if you're like me, and can appreciate the beauty of the visual, thematic, and philosophical art of filmmaking, as well appreciate the subtle but undeniable parody of the entire production, it might very well be a film you'll want to add to your collection.",4,A neon-tinted critique of our modern youth,1372550400,"06 30, 2013",2013,3526,"['first', 'impression', 'Spring', 'Breakers', 'will', 'detriment', 'always', 'appear', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'tasteless', 'exploitation', 'cast', 'overly', 'willing', 'ex-Disney', 'channel', 'teens', 'Which', 'shame', 'film', 'very', 'least', 'attempts', 'achieve', 'least', 'level', 'profound', 'introspection', 'commentary.The', 'film', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'present', 'day', 'take', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'exaggerating', 'parodying', 'flaws', 'American', 'youth', 'highlighting', 'too', 'realistic', 'melding', 'childish', 'ignorance', 'world', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'ugly', 'landscapeof', 'crime', 'violence', 'sex.Despite', 'lofty', 'aspirations', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'writer/director', 'Haromy', 'Korine', 'simply', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'talent', 'skill', 'make', 'most', 'story', 'concept', 'consistently', 'strong', 'desire', 'prove', 'overall', 'point', 'always', 'evident', 'script', 'ingenuity', 'vigor', 'make', 'name', 'film', 'people', 'will', 'talk', 'years', 'come.Still', 'plenty', 'like', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'obviously', 'not', 'best', 'writer', 'business', 'Korine', 'most', 'certainly', 'extremely', 'skilled', 'intelligent', 'director', 'knowledge', 'art', 'able', 'turn', 'film', 'eery', 'yet', 'beauty', 'dreamscape', 'insightful', 'editing', 'use', 'music', 'sound', 'movie', 'always', 'extremely', 'lucid', 'serene', 'tone', 'nothing', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'reality', 'rather', 'warped', 'quite', 'obviously', 'untrue', 'perception', 'main', 'characters.The', 'creation', 'atmosphere', 'greatly', 'overall', 'characterization', 'characters', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'most', 'definitely', 'quite', 'wholly', 'vapid', 'obnoxious', 'are', 'least', 'humanized', 'can', 'least', 'begin', 'understand', 'motivations', 'actions.Which', 'again', 'very', 'intelligent', 'method', 'characterization', 'expression', 'theme', 'lesser', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'fallen', 'trap', 'attempting', 'detail', 'thematic', 'intent', 'heavy', 'handed', 'dialogue', 'entirely', 'unlikeable', 'characters', 'Korine', 'avoids', 'usual', 'pitfalls.The', 'other', 'consistently', 'noticeable', 'impressive', 'aspects', 'film', 'cinematography', 'color', 'palette', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'film', 'Maybe', 'not', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Korine', 'use', 'bright', 'neons', 'beachwear', 'nightlife', 'combined', 'Florida', 'naturally', 'gorgeous', 'geography', 'make', 'impressing', 'melding', 'artificial', 'vibrant', 'serene', 'subdued.In', 'terms', 'cast', 'only', 'Gomez', 'Franco', 'who', 'turn', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Gomez', 'strength', 'seemingly', 'natural', 'born', 'innocence', 'childlike', 'moral', 'fortitude', 'one', 'tear-filled', 'scene', 'acting', 'crescendo', 'entire', 'performance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'Oscars', 'solid', 'nevertheless', 'Franco', 'ability', 'so', 'drastically', 'morph', 'envelop', 'role', 'south', 'Florida', 'ganger', 'wannabe', 'incredible', 'Again', 'constant', 'balance', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'humor', 'underlying', 'condemnation', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'culture', 'film.Overall', 'Spring', 'Breakers', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', ""'re"", 'paramount', 'concern', 'film', 'deft', 'scripting', 'likable', 'characters', 'Spring', 'Breakers', 'will', 'probably', 'come', 'off', 'rather', 'wholly', 'loathsome', ""'re"", 'can', 'appreciate', 'beauty', 'visual', 'thematic', 'philosophical', 'art', 'filmmaking', 'as', 'well', 'subtle', 'undeniable', 'parody', 'entire', 'production', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'film', ""'ll"", 'want', 'add', 'collection']",N/A

With so little cash saved up from the start of the year, Cotty (Rachel Korine), Brit (Ashley Benson), and Candy (Vanessa Hudgens) rob a chicken shack to get the money they need without their religious friend Faith (Selena Gomez) knowing anything about it. Their dream vacation full of alcohol, drugs, and half naked college guys comes to a screaming halt after the four of them are arrested. With no money left, the girls are bailed out by a local druglord named Alien (James Franco) who seems to have unsettling plans for them.Most of this 94-minute cinematic experiment doesn't even feel like a film. A bunch of partying in slow-motion set to dubstep, hip hop, and James Franco saying, ""Spring break,"" 12 times in a row doesn't exactly move the story along. Are you ready to get jacked up on God? TNA wrestler and co-founder Jeff Jarrett is and appears in the film as a casual priest. One of the funniest lines is when Faith is smoking and hanging out with these two nameless girls. One of them tells Faith that she should ""pray super hardcore"" since she's going to Florida with Brit and Candy.Everything is built around going to Florida, getting away from it all, and doing bong hits in a stranger's house or snorting coke off of someone's stomach that they just met or performing fellatio when you don't have enough tip money. Partying, sex, booze, and drugs; that's all these girls care about. Forget finishing your education. Pass that blunt and schedule a few three-ways to find the true meaning of life. And don't forget to pretend to blow your brains out as often as possible.However, the chicken shack robbery is done really well. You sit in the passenger seat as a masked Cotty circles the restaurant while Brit and Candy rob the place with plastic squirt guns and a hammer. You get brief glimpses of the chaos inside whenever Cotty passes by a window. James Franco is simultaneously fantastic and really annoying. The Alien character is so repetitive and he often ruins good lines by making them completely redundant. Some of his dialogue is hilarious though as is a certain slo-mo robbery montage he's a part of.Alien is really unpredictable, as well. He rides this really uneasy wave when he first shows up and seems to purposely welcome an uncomfortable atmosphere. The girls get especially nerve-grating since half of them act like their junk is bigger than every guy they come into contact with while the other two tuck their tail between their legs and go back home when things don't go as planned. You're hanging out with a drug dealer and teasing sweaty dudes you just met with your naked body. You're in college. You should know this will end badly.Slap an ice cream tattoo on your face and get ready for ""Spring Breakers."" It's like a music video mash-up with no real point. This is like The Prodigy's video for ""Smack My Bitch Up"" stretched out for an hour and a half. James Franco is kind of awesome despite being a constant broken record on repeat.

1633092,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00BEJL4RO,Darren,"[9, 13]","Just look at all those 1-star reviews, my my.  Why do I get the feeling that those 1-star rates and comments are from a bunch of guys in their early 20s going, ""wtf""?  They had hoped for something stupid and sexy; what they got was an art film from a moralist who has a lot to say about the gangsta culture embraced by bored Caucasian suburban youth.  It's a culture that glorifies violence and ostentatious consumption (""Look at all my S***!"" James Franco howls with glee while jumping up and down on his ridiculous bed).  It's a culture that encourages young women to look and act like whores while simultaneously pretending to some sort of you-go-girl faux-feminism.  I am Woman, hear me roar -- now watch me shake my booty like Beyonce.  Feminism for Dummies.  This culture is now mainstream among the under-25 set.  ""Spring Breakers"" attacks that culture by taking its precepts to their logical conclusion.  By doing so, director Harmony Korine (male, btw) also attacks the generation responsible for it.  No wonder y'all hate this movie, yo.  Not only has this movie gotten on your nerves, I suspect it has struck a few nerves, too.One thing's for certain: Increasing equality between the sexes is creating more aggressive females, sexually or otherwise.  The movie shows this paradigm in action with a superb scene between Franco and two of the girls in his bed.  After thinking that he's impressed them both with his gangsta routine, he's ready to get down to business with them ... but they turn the tables on him, holding him at gunpoint (he has guns lying around everywhere) and sticking the guns in his mouth.  The gender roles are reversed, or, more interestingly, blurred.  The pink ski masks that the girls wear while accompanying Franco on his robberies is another example of blurred, or combined, gender symbolism.  Pink, once disdained in the 70s and 80s as a girly color, is now the color of the female warrior.  There's even a pop star who calls herself ""Pink"".  By golly, I guess the girls of the world took back pink.  Whether or not this advances the cause of women is up for debate, as is aggression for aggression's sake.Our four Spring Breakers can be divided into three factions: 1) the earnest and Christian Selena Gomez, torn between her need for action and her sense of right and wrong.  (The other girls mock her when she's not around.)  2) Rachel Korine as the pure party-girl.  She gets the drunkest and goes along with the crowd, but when the going gets rough a latent survival instinct kicks in.  3) Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson, the Bad Girls, the girls who doodle male genitalia on notebooks while in class, the girls who go the furthest with Franco.  They're his superior in every way, having established dominance in that bedroom scene with the guns.  The movie encourages debate about what Hudgens and Benson are supposed to represent: the natural culmination of feminism, or a regression?  What's better? -- the moral but helpless Gomez who weeps in terror as Franco tries to soothe her, or the promiscuous and violent Bad Girls, who, while totally in control of their situation, also happen to have the morality of vipers?  There's probably not a ""right"" answer; the director is just posing some interesting questions.4 out of 5; a fascinating surprise.  Never has a movie gone so far out of its way to blow up expectations; it's as if director Korine deliberately tried to lose money in the hopes of creating a cult classic.

Despite the sunny faade they tried to paint of this annual college midterm event it always struck me that there was a dark underbelly of hedonism and excess.  Director Harmony Korine uses this annual bacchanalian event as a cautionary vehicle to say that good kids grow up to be good adults if they make the right choices in their formative years.  Bad kids are just plain bad not because they made the wrong choices but made the ones that serve their self interest.  I never thought that a movie with so many perfectly toned young physiques in their most naked form could make me depressed but I think that is the intention of the filmmaker.  Judging from the negative reaction of some of the other reviews I can sense that this is most definitely not the sunny feel good party-all-the-time movie they were expecting.  Give Korine credit for not exploiting his targeted audience unlike some cynical Hollywood types and showing life as it is.

(for that matter, neither did they.) and while the script has a certain macho feminist edge and slacker work ethic (just pretend it's a movie, it's all just a dream), the story arc basically replays ""easy rider"" with scooters and balaclavas. the moral of this pseudomorality tale is the cliche that girls need to be the best they can be ... even when that's being a *killer* psychopath.",3,"pussy riot meets ""easy rider""",1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,1067,"['i', 'come', 'down', 'middle', 'haters', 'enthusiasts', 'merit', 'film', 'something', 'detract', 'visual', 'style', 'script', 'are', 'interesting', 'many', 'repeated', 'scenes', 'camera', 'angles', 'computer', 'enhanced', 'images', 'dialog', 'tag', 'lines', 'become', 'tedious', 'dreary', 'landscape', 'coed', 'existence', 'mind', 'numbing', 'college', 'lectures', 'religious', 'culture', 'drug', 'parties', 'dorms', 'look', 'low', 'security', 'lockups', 'presented', 'effectively', 'young', 'women', 'have', 'nothing', 'aspire', 'spring', 'break', 'nowhere', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'i', 'enjoyed', 'franco', 'jaunt', 'tin', 'toothed', 'ghetto', 'devil', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'four', 'girls', 'matter', 'did', 'script', 'certain', 'macho', 'feminist', 'edge', 'slacker', 'work', 'ethic', 'just', 'pretend', 'movie', 'just', 'dream', 'story', 'arc', 'basically', 'easy', 'rider', 'scooters', 'balaclavas', 'moral', 'pseudomorality', 'tale', 'cliche', 'girls', 'need', 'be', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'even', 'when', 'being', '*killer*', 'psychopath']",N/A

1633119,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BEJL4RO,FNDNreview,"[3, 6]","There's no need to beat around the bush with this review - because this day has been on the calendar for quite some time.  Spring Breakers, a film that has been making waves in the land of film festivals for the last few months, has finally been released nationwide.  Based on the early reviews (because it's hard not to hear about a controversial locomotive heading your way), Spring Breakers is a film destined to illicit a response (good or bad) from anyone that views it.  For better or worse, Harmony Korine has another controversial picture on his hands (see Kids) depicting teens doing drugs, having sex, and essentially any other activity college kids could possibly do over spring break.  Only in this film, Korine's college kids are none other than some of Hollywood's squeaky clean young actresses - who will, by the time the film ends, shed their spotless image.Directed by Harmony Korine (Kids), Spring Breakers is a story about four college girls that make the trip to Florida for spring break.  Prior to making the trip, Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Brit (Ashley Benson), and Cotty (Rachel Korine, the director's wife) rob a diner in order to have enough money to make the trip - prior to meeting up with their church-goer friend, Faith (Selena Gomez).  Once in Florida, too much partying with drugs and alcohol lands the girls in jail, only to be randomly bailed out by Alien (James Franco), a local rap artist/drug dealer.  Alien uses his money and power to impress the impressionable girls, and it eventually pulls the girls into Aliens way of life - climaxing in a face-off against another local drug dealer, Big Arch (Gucci Mane).As far as the content of the film goes, Spring Breakers pushes the envelope, and then it pushes it even more with its sexist and racist character portrayals (but we won't get into that here)  - which oddly enough didn't earn itself an NC-17 rating.  The film begins with spring breakers partying on the beach, most of which are college co-eds in all their topless glory - quickly setting the mood for this film.  The consistency of sex and drug use over the course of the film is typical of Harmony Korine's style of film-making, but it's still a bit shocking if you've never seen his previous work.  There are plenty of hippie-ish drug induced segments, not to mention a threesome pool scene that will make Wild Things look tame and innocent - which also happens to be the scene that will completely shatter the spotless images of former Disney star Vanessa Hudgens and Pretty Little Liars star Ashley Benson.Let's be honest, this film caters to teens and young adults - most of whom will show up to theaters looking to see Selena Gomez parade around in a bikini.  If that's what you're after, then you'll enjoy the film, but her character adds little more to the film, other than to keep her squeaky clean Hollywood image intact.  James Franco, on the other hand, is the showstopper in this film.  From the moment he hits the screen, corn rolls and all, he's nothing short of sublime.  He portrays a quirky, odd individual - and at first, you'll have to do a double take to make sure that's really James Franco.  He displays a complete confidence in this role, providing a slew of memorable moments in which his too odd, too funny gangster rap character will completely win you over and have you rooting for his success.To say Spring Breakers is a twisted, unorthodox film would be an understatement.  One minute these four girls are disappointed about not having enough money to make the trip down south for spring break, and the next thing you know they're randomly robbing a diner.  There are scenes in which the film feels very cartoon-ish, and then there are scenes that are so dramatically fulfilling that at certain points it feels like two different films are mixed into one.  For instance, in the diner robbery scene, these girls put a dramatic 180 degree spin on their characters by verbally assaulting random diner customers as they rob them (with a fake gun and sledge hammer), and the next thing you know they're sitting outside singing Britney Spears at the top of their lungs.  While we're on the subject of Britney, the girls bellow a few of her tunes over the course of the film - one of which is in a rather humorous scene helmed by James Franco's character as he plays the piano, while the girls sing.  And - oddly enough, it works perfectly for the film.In the end, Spring Breakers is a mind-blowing experience with its share of ups and downs.  With sheer certainty, you'll either love this film or hate it with the fiery passion of a million sultry suns.  If you look past the abundance of drugs, sex, and other offensive content, you will see a film that aims to tell a dramatic story about loyalty, and the meaning of a life changing experience.  Without a doubt, Spring Breakers has cult classic written all over it.Overall Film Grade:  B+FNDNreview.com",4,'Spring Breakers' a mind blowing experience,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,4925,"['need',

1633132,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B00BEJL4RO,I'm Right,"[3, 11]","The only redeemable quality about this film is James Franco, who must've been friends with the director or lost a bet or something, because he usually doesn't sully his trackt record like this.Spring Breakers, from what I heard, is a satire/social commentary on today's party-crazy youth. I don't know where that was in the movie though, because it seemed to get caught up in whatever it was trying to criticize. So instead of Spring Breakers showing the dark side to the party life, it instead descends to some petty gangster movie. Basically James Franco bails these chicks out of jail, and some of them help him kill a rival. *Yawn*, oh sorry was that story supposed to be interesting? When he bailed them out one of the girls gets cautious and starts wondering why he bailed them out, what ulterior motives James had, which could've gone in a far more interesting direction. But no, instead we get some glamorized shoot out complete with ironic Britney Spears music on top.This movie also has a tendency to repeat dialogue over and over again, as if James Franco groaning ""spriiing breaaaak"" is meaningful only once, we need to hear it instead like 50 times. The story just flat out sucked, many shots that could've been spent attempting to develop these flat characters instead shows them dancing/posing for pictures in slow motion with voice overs repeated ad nauseum. Before the remaining girls and James Franco go to the final shootout, they have slow motion sex in a hot tub repeating the same ""scaredy cat"" line for about 15 minutes. Finally they stroll over to his rival and basically just kill everyone, no consequences for the girls, just pussy power or whatever. I wasn't focused on the ending so it looked like they just shot James Franco in the back and were about to leave, but I rewinded and saw that he just got shot by the first guy and they resume the murdering rampage without him. So what we know about these girls is that they like to murder, which doesn't seem like an accurate depiction of most girls on spring break. Again, another missed opportunity where it would've been much more interesting to see them just shoot James in the back and walk away from his mess.Overall this movie's plot development moves at a glacial pace with vapid uninspired characters in glitzy neon locations.

1633136,A55RQ26WDPSM0,B00BEJL4RO,Iusedtobeacat,"[0, 6]","I watched this movie under the recommendation of a friend of mine, who kept insisting that this is the most amazing, breakthrough and momentous movie ever. It's supposed to be about two college students who end up making money and living the dream or so she told me.  I thought I was going to watch something incredible, memorable with astounding performances and a strong storyline I was wrong, dead wrong. As soon as Spring Breakers started I knew It was gonna suck and it did. Terribly.First of all let's talk about the most basic thing a movie should have, a story. I guess you can say Spring Breakers have a story of some sort except it's very disoriented and unfocused it doesn't seem real. The Characters are ghost like, the movie keeps skipping from one scene to another without much depth or transition, we don't really know what exactly is going on. There's a lot of partying, drug abuse, nudity with vocals in the background of the characters talking about how they feel but that doesn't really add depth to them or portray them as human beings because guess what, the narration doesn't matter if the characters themselves keep acting like cold blooded robots for the entire film. I swear they're all very one dimensional and have a one track mind, The girls all they care about is alcohol, partying, drugs, money and sex. Typical of college students but they do seem to go a bit over the top with their vices. James Franco is completely boring in his role and the only thing he cares about is money, besides drugs, sex and partying. So, it's no wonder the girls and him hit it on since they have common interests but that's about it. After that it's a series of killing sprees that lack in action and drama. Boring!The Execution is terribly bad. If it were up to me I would give this movie zero stars cause that's all it deserves really. There's nothing to be seen here. If you want nudity you can watch a porno there I said it! Not even seeing Vanessa Hudgenes and other chicks in either a bikini or topless is worth watching this train wreck. It's like the director itself didn't know what he wanted to do with this movie, he had a premise in his head but just wasn't sure how was it supposed to go so he just brought a couple of big names together, gave them tacky lines to recite, hired expensive cars with a little bit of gun and partying scenes here and there and called it a movie. Very Lazy!In the end this movie doesn't really know what it wants to be seen as, it's not a porno although the cast is naked 99% of the time. It's not an Ocean's eleven retelling of college girls who get introduced to the world of robberies and money scheming. It's not thelma and louise. It's not an action film or a comedy or a romance. It's none of those things there's no exact gender and there's no exact story.I would like to watch something with more depth and morals to it. Something I can relate to at least. If you're gonna do a movie then follow some guidelines at least give the characters some chance to talk and introduce them to us. Instead of having them say a couple of lines and then just party and have sex 90% of the time. There's no passion no nothing. It's all empty.I'm sorry I just didn't like this movie. It's just a 120 minute of irresponsible college girls who have no sense and no logic whatsoever. Materialistic, superficial blondes who are only interested in having sex, binge drinking, drug abuse and oh well shooting people in order to gain money more precisely drug lords and get away with it eventually without being caught by the police or even questioned. Then You have another boring character who does nothing but repeats his lines it's like he's stuck in some time frame and he's not likable or admirable in anyway either. Morally corrupt characters with no shame. No redeeming qualities whatsoever! Except maybe the dub step soundtrack maybe that'll justify the one star I'm forced to give. And why is everyone so superficially perfect, beautiful and model like?

Spring Breakers was being touted as the most accessible of Harmony Korine's career.  While that may be technically true, when you have the likes of Trash Humpers and Gummo on your resume that really isn't saying much.  In spite of the bikini clad babes on the cover and the presence of James Franco this is still a Harmony Korine film--so Spring Breakers is self-indulgent to the point of viewer torture, it has no plot or barely anything that could be construed as narrative, the dialogue makes everybody in the movie sound profoundly stupid and generally sounds like it was improvised or written by somebody who was stoned rather than ""written"" in the conventional sense that a real screenwriter would use and the characters are interchangeable, one-dimensional and forgettable. Only James Franco really makes any impression at all as a small-time rapper/drug dealer who thinks he's a gangsta.  It's a shame Franco wasn't this good in Oz The Great and Powerful.  Other than Franco, who is pretty amusing, Spring Breakers is empty-headed and mind-numbimgly boring, in spite of the frequent female flesh on display.  When Selena Gomez did an interview saying her mom was the biggest Harmony Korine fan in the world it made me laugh because a) of the extreme unlikelihood of that actually being true and b) it indicated that she had probably never actually seen a Harmony Korine film before, although she did look up some titles before doing the interview.  Like the James Franco character in Spring Breakers Harmony Korine is more of a hustler than anything else.  He has convinced some people that he's an artistic genius.  I don't think he has a scrap of talent, but if you are one of those people who are inclined to like Korine's films then you will undoubtedly be impressed by this one as well.

1633165,A2R1YK3THA0RB3,B00BEJL4RO,Josh,"[2, 5]","Not too often will I write a bad review. I have seen very many movies both good and bad. I am honest, but I try my best not to do bad reviews( if at all possible). This is a movie that has been hailed as being both good and bad. So in my 56th review, I am going to give my take on the movie: Spring Breakers.Spring Breakers has a star studded cast that includes: Selena Gomez as Faith(ironically enough you will see why), Vanessa Hudgens as Candy , Ashley Benson as Brittany, Rachel Korine as Cotty, a rapper by the name of Gucci Mane as Archie, and James Franco as the character Alien (yes ALIEN). For the type of movie this is, and the way this movie was shot, I honestly liked the acting in this movie, and I feel that each performance was well matched.The story line is as the title suggests; IT IS Spring break. That being said, the story line is not meant to as memorable as say, a Toy Story movie. I will not go into full detail, but initially, 4 girls who are friends take a trip during their spring break. No one could have predicted it would be a spring break they would not soon forget.Spring Breakers is not a classic by any means. It is not the best movie I have ever seen, nor is it the best Spring break movie I have seen. And normally, a movie with such gratuitous nudity, drug usuage, and lack of stellar acting, would be in my ""Movies I tend to avoid"" book. This movie is a movie that will undeniably make a person laugh at some points, make another person shake his/her head at certain points, and will probably at a few parts make you ask yourself, ""why in the world am i watching this movie?""; but, Spring Breakers will also surprise you with the tone of seriousness it presents at other parts of the movie. And despite all that, this movie still does have a meaning, and unlike some movies, it shows you exactly what it is. There is not much going for this movie as a whole, but if you are able to bring yourself to watch the whole movie, then you will see exactly what I am saying.Again, Spring Breakers is not a ground breaking movie at all. And I completely understand why certain people dislike this movie. It is not a movie for kids it is not. But on a scale of 1 to 10, I give this movie a likeable7/10",3,"Easy to see why some dislike it, but here is why I liked Spring Breakers",1374537600,"07 23, 2013",2013,2230,"['Not', 'too', 'often', 'will', 'write', 'bad', 'review', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'many', 'movies', 'good', 'bad', 'am', 'honest', 'try', 'best', 'not', 'do', 'bad', 'reviews', 'possible', 'movie', 'been', 'hailed', 'being', 'good', 'bad', 'So', '56th', 'review', 'am', 'going', 'give', 'take', 'movie', 'Spring', 'Breakers.Spring', 'Breakers', 'star', 'studded', 'cast', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'Faith', 'ironically', 'enough', 'will', 'see', 'why', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'Candy', 'Ashley', 'Benson', 'Brittany', 'Rachel', 'Korine', 'Cotty', 'rapper', 'name', 'Gucci', 'Mane', 'Archie', 'James', 'Franco', 'character', 'Alien', 'yes', 'ALIEN', 'type', 'movie', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'honestly', 'liked', 'acting', 'movie', 'feel', 'performance', 'was', 'well', 'matched.The', 'story', 'line', 'title', 'IT', 'Spring', 'break', 'being', 'said', 'story', 'line', 'not', 'meant', 'as', 'memorable', 'say', 'Toy', 'Story', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'full', 'detail', 'initially', '4', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'friends', 'take', 'trip', 'spring', 'break', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'predicted', 'would', 'be', 'spring', 'break', 'would', 'not', 'soon', 'forget.Spring', 'Breakers', 'not', 'classic', 'means', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'best', 'Spring', 'break', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'normally', 'movie', 'such', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'drug', 'usuage', 'lack', 'stellar', 'acting', 'would', 'be', 'Movies', 'tend', 'avoid', 'book', 'movie', 'movie', 'will', 'undeniably', 'make', 'person', 'laugh', 'points', 'make', 'person', 'shake', 'his/her', 'head', 'certain', 'points', 'will', 'probably', 'few', 'parts', 'make', 'ask', 'why', 'world', 'am', 'i', 'watching', 'movie', 'Spring', 'Breakers', 'will', 'also', 'surprise', 'tone', 'seriousness', 'other', 'parts', 'movie', 'movie', 'still', 'have', 'meaning', 'movies', 'exactly', 'what', 'not', 'much', 'going', 'movie', 'whole', 'are', 'able', 'bring', 'watch', 'whole', 'movie', 'then', 'will', 'see', 'exactly', 'what', 'am', 'saying.Again', 'Spring', 'Breakers', 'not', 'ground', 'breaking', 'movie', 'completely', 'understand', 'why', 'certain', 'people', 'dislike', 'movie', 'not', 'movie', 'kids', 'not', 'scale', '1', '10', 'give', 'movie', 'likeable7/10']",N/A

1633186,AOZFQAPPLMVOB,B00BEJL4RO,"Lone Alaskan Gypsy ""Lone Alaskan Gypsy""","[0, 0]","I went into this movie with an open mind. I read a few reviews prior to watching. It gave me a small idea of what the film entailed, but I still opted to watch it. This movie features the story of four girls who yearn to venture from their small-city town to Florida for spring break. The movie starts off with the girls lacking the funds to make the trip happen, so three of them (all but Selena Gomez's character) rob a small diner. This ends them up with the money, as well as a new awakening of their 'bad girl' side.Selena Gomez, on the other hand, plays Faith, a girl who never truly finds her 'bad girl' half. Faith is a semi-reserved Christian who yearns to follow the Bible, yet experience more than the boring and stereotypical. She's caught between loving the idea of being free, and loving God. If you're hoping to find Selena naked in this film, then you've picked the wrong movie. Some people even seem to have rated this film based merely on the lack of nudity from Selena. I find that ridiculous- but hey, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. The movie also seems to target Selena as a main character, but she's not. Her big name is plastered all over the advertisements for this movie. But she's only present in about half of the scenes. I was really proud of Selena for taking this role. Would I want my teenage kids seeing this movie? No. But I feel like Selena, although experimenting with a more adult-oriented film, still held true to the 'good girl' image that I feel works well for her in Hollywood. I think she was cast appropriately for the part. Going into the movie I really thought Selena should not have been a part of it, but as the movie went on I'm happy she played Faith.Rachel Korine, plays a pink-haired girl. I'd say she's more of a follower. She's not the leader of the pack, but she loves being involved in everything bad. The beginning scene in which the girls rob the diner, Rachel supplies the car and is the getaway driver. Throughout the movie she's the only girl you'll find breast shots of. She's the girl who maybe isn't so deeply in love with the violent side of 'being bad', but rather the male attention that coincides with it. I recognize Rachel's face, but I don't know from where. With that being said I feel she was cast appropriately. There were a few parts I questioned how 'true' she was to the character. I feel like she couldn't really portray her 100%. But I think she did okay.And then there are Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson, the leaders of the pack. These two girls get the idea to rob the diner, are the actual robbers, and essentially become the sociopathic characters of the story. Vanessa didn't surprise me. I knew she definitely was old enough to play this part. I think it's a part she really yearned to play after being cast as a 'good girl' in High School Musical. She really wanted to break-away from that. And I think she tried a bit too hard in this film to show she was no longer 'a little girl'. Some of her acting I felt was being pushed a bit. Like it didn't flow. But by the end of the film she toned it down a bit and it came more naturally. At first I wasn't buying it- but by the last scene I'd accepted her in the role. Ashley on the other hand, did a pretty vivid job of portraying the bad girl right from the start. She's the hard-core druggie of the group. The true sociopath. I was honestly really surprised by her acting. She blew away my expectations.So essentially the girls find themselves in Florida, get arrested for underage drinking, and then are bailed out of jail and meet up with a 'Gansta', played by James Franco. This guy was unbelievably stupid. I have no idea why James decided to pull off this uneducated douche, rather than sticking to more of an arrogant greedy gangster. He was like a half red-neck, half-gangster. It did not work at all. The film lets you in on the fact he was a white kid raised in a black neighborhood- but I don't see that inner-city black aura in him. I saw white in him- lots of white. And I know a few 'white' inner city sort of 'bad boys', and none compare to James' character. This guy came off as more of an idiot. Had he tried to mimic more of an Eminem attitude, I think it would have worked. I have no idea what he based his character off of. It was embarrassing to watch half the time. I just don't get why he acted so stupid and had this weird half-southern accent.I won't spoil the rest of the movie, but as the film goes on you find out who the girls truly are. That's how I'll leave that,Now onto the part of this film I hated. The reason it's rated R. There is a lot of cursing. This I found acceptable- as it honestly portrays the characters correctly. The characters definitely would use that kind of language in real life. And then we move along to the nudity. I've seen plenty of films involving full-nudity. Many European and indie productions. Nudity doesn't bother me at all- in fact I find it to really accentuate some films. But this film totally just exploited women. The filming was not done tastefully at all. There is a difference between nudity and pornography. This film was pornography. If you're looking for plenty of breast shots, then by all means- watch this movie. There is plenty of that. Shots that totally degrade the female body. None of the filming was done tastefully. It was pretty much 'Girls Gone Wild' with a storyline. The film could have been done so much better had it been filmed without the slow panning over females and focusing on weird angles that only pornographers would use in a film. There's also a lot of violence in the film. That didn't really bother me. Just the stupid camera-work did.As for the storyline- it was... unfortunately real. I felt like some of the casting was a bit off, which didn't help with the storyline at all. But to be honest, it was a pretty legitimate portrayal of the modern American 15 to 25 age group. I'm 22 and female, and I really feel like it was right. Granted, MOST girls I know have matured beyond this 'bad girl' phase that's being portrayed in the film. But there are a few who will inevitably fall into this kind of behavior. Although this is more of an extreme case- it definitely shows the unfortunate truth of our generation's self-indulgent activities. It's all about money, fame, and sex appeal. This film brought those specific things to the surface. It's heartbreaking, tragic, and in a lot of ways true of what our generation has become. I don't like the honesty of it, but I appreciate the fact nothing was left hidden. Definitely unique. Not for everyone. Had the casting been more accurate and the filming done a bit more professionally, it would have been worth five stars. But because I really couldn't grasp the storyline with the actors that were chosen, and the film-work was overwhelming and distasteful- I can only give it 3 stars",3,"Unique, Honest, But Not For

I could only give it one star, because that's as low as we can go, but if zero (or -1, or better yet -5) were possible, that's what I would give it.  Read the previous reviews for a more-or-less accurate synopsis.  I didn't catch any satire, social or otherwise; nor would I call it pornographic.  Porn is usually titillating, at least on some level or another.  There is nothing titillating about a bunch of young women bouncing around topless pouring cheep wine on themselves, nor a bunch of young men engaging in such utterly pointless and self-destructive behavior as guzzling down cheap beer & vodka, smoking bad pot and snorting coke from a girl's bare-breasted chest.Four young women are bored in college (while no-doubt racking up thousands in student-loan debt just to be there).  Oh please, cry me a river!  So they engage in an armed-robbery (yes, it's still considered armed-robbery, even if the weapons used are only toys) to procure the funds to go on their desired spring break along with the rest of their college friends and dorm mates.  They get away scot-free, no consequence for their actions.Upon arrival, it's just more of the same bad behavior, with virtually no consequence for their choices, save for a few days in a county jail.  And they get bailed out by a local gangster, a lone-wolf of sorts, and become part of his pathetic little gang.  Ultimately two of the four leave, while the remaining two go on to commit more egregious acts.  The film ends with the gangster dead, and the last two returning home, ostensibly to their normal college life.  Oh PLEASE!While the film may slightly exaggerate spring break behavior in Florida, certainly in real life young college students make some stupid choices.  But unlike in this film, in the real world, there are consequences for the stupid choices we make as youth.  And in the real world, we're held accountable, we learn from our mistakes, we accept the consequences, and we progress and mature.  Not so in this film. I kept watching, hoping that the characters might actually learn something along the way.  But that didn't happen. There was no growth; no maturity.  These kids learned absolutely nothing!  And I missed any component of satire.A suggestion to any poor lost soul who is bored with college life and wants to see more of the world, who wants to find deeper meaning to life: Don't go to Florida on spring break to find it.  Try Haiti.  Or somewhere in Central America, say Honduras or Nicaragua.  Or Baghdad.

The question is, who are these girls? By the end of the film I didn't know their names. I know Selina Gomez is the bored church girl who seems to live with her grandmother and hangs out with her three skank friends Fake blond 1, Fake blond 2 and Pink hair. They have saved money to go to spring break (as if that is actually a place, it's not addressed where they actually go!) but not enough, so the three not Selina girls rob a restaurant with water pistols and a mallet. They jet off to ""spring break"" (via bus) and do a lot of coke & weed. They get busted at a party and bailed out by James Franco, Alien, a drug dealer with twin henchmen (who's characters seem menacing, but who just vanish before the film ends) and a seeming love of Fivesomes.Church girl bails, pink hair girl gets bullet in arm, bails, fake blonds stay, have three-way in swimming pool and go out to get revenge on the rival dealer who shot pink-hair girl.The film ends with two blond girls holding guns limp-wristed at arms length looking like they are going to drop them at any second and may at best shoot the dirt in front of them manage to take out an entire gang Martin Rigg's style!For all the bare breast our Disney alum and friends stay mostly covered, so if that's what you're looking for, you're not getting it. Karmine has shot and edited the film in frenetic Oliver Stone mode, but without the control or finesse. Scenes are glimpsed out of context and out of continuity and lines are echoed over and over and over -- Franco ""spring break, forevah!"" get's so grating you want to hit him for saying it once much less a hundred times! Yet there's really no moments to know any of these girls save the Gomez character. There's a scene near the end where two fake blond make what sound like good-bye phone calls, to give the viewer a sense they are going to die. Do they? Who cares? You don't care about them, they are just eye candy.And so is this film, just a frantic, lunatic ""natural born killers"" wannabe that forgets first we have to know and care about the characters then the action has meaning.",3,"Stylized and detatched, brain sugar.",1376438400,"08 14, 2013",2013,2223,"[':There', 'be', 'spoilers', ':Harmony', 'Korine', 'bright', 'hyper', 'lunatic', 'film', 'four', 'girls', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'go', 'spring', 'break', 'question', 'who', 'are', 'girls', 'end', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'names', 'know', 'Selina', 'Gomez', 'bored', 'church', 'girl', 'who', 'live', 'grandmother', 'hangs', 'out', 'three', 'skank', 'friends', 'Fake', 'blond', '1', 'Fake', 'blond', '2', 'Pink', 'hair', 'have', 'saved', 'money', 'go', 'spring', 'break', 'actually', 'place', 'not', 'addressed', 'where', 'actually', 'go', 'not', 'enough', 'three', 'not', 'Selina', 'girls', 'rob', 'restaurant', 'water', 'pistols', 'mallet', 'jet', 'off', 'spring', 'break', 'bus', 'do', 'lot', 'coke', 'weed', 'get', 'busted', 'party', 'bailed', 'out', 'James', 'Franco', 'Alien', 'drug', 'dealer', 'twin', 'henchmen', 'who', 'characters', 'seem', 'menacing', 'who', 'just', 'vanish', 'film', 'seeming', 'love', 'Fivesomes.Church', 'girl', 'bails', 'pink', 'hair', 'girl', 'bullet', 'arm', 'bails', 'fake', 'blonds', 'stay', 'have', 'three-way', 'swimming', 'pool', 'go', 'out', 'get', 'revenge', 'rival', 'dealer', 'who', 'shot', 'pink-hair', 'girl.The', 'film', 'two', 'blond', 'girls', 'holding', 'guns', 'limp-wristed', 'arms', 'length', 'looking', 'are', 'going', 'drop', 'second', 'may', 'best', 'shoot', 'dirt', 'front', 'manage', 'take', 'out', 'entire', 'gang', 'Martin', 'Rigg', 'style', 'bare', 'Disney', 'alum', 'friends', 'stay', 'mostly', 'covered', 'so', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', ""'re"", 'not', 'getting', 'Karmine', 'shot', 'edited', 'film', 'frenetic', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'mode', 'control', 'finesse', 'Scenes', 'are', 'glimpsed', 'context', 'continuity', 'lines', 'are', 'echoed', 'over', 'Franco', 'spring', 'break', 'forevah', 'get', 'so', 'grating', 'want', 'hit', 'saying', 'once', 'much', 'less', 'hundred', 'times', 'really', 'moments', 'know', 'girls', 'save', 'Gomez', 'character', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'two', 'fake', 'blond', 'make', 'what', 'sound', 'good-bye', 'phone', 'calls', 'give', 'viewer', 'sense', 'are', 'going', 'die', 'Do', 'Who', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'are', 'just', 'eye', 'candy.And', 'so', 'film', 'just', 'frantic', 'lunatic', 'natural', 'born', 'killers', 'wannabe', 'forgets', 'first', 'have', 'know', 'care', 'characters', 'then', 'action', 'meaning']",N/A

1633231,A3EX8EGBM1U8W0,B00BEJL4RO,Nic,"[4, 8]","I wouldn't recommend reading this unless you've seen the film.The bright sun glistens off the bright blue water as the warm sand squishes  between your toes. Laughter and joyful screams fill the air. The beer funnel is  full again and you're up next. &#34;Woooo!&#34; echoes throughout the beach. Smiles  surround you and everyone is inviting. This is Spring break. This is the dream.  Though just as all dreams do it is sure to come to an abrupt end. Bright lights  and neon swim wear can only last so long before the harsh world comes bounding  upon you. How far would you go to make it last? What would you be willing to do  in order to have spring break forever? These are just a few of the questions  Harmony Korine posits in his newest effort Spring Breakers. A study on the youth  culture today and how amoral and corrupt just having fun can become.Korine's nonlinear editing is a thing of genius here and really drives the film  on. The constant foreshadowing and hints of the future assure that the tension  never lets up and the view is never able to be at ease. Something isn't right  here. Even through all the partying and seeming happiness something darker lies  just beneath the surface. It will not be all laughter and smiles. Something will  go very wrong. This feeling is met with truth as the film unfolds. Korine uses  erratic dubstep music and quick cuts to illustrate the ever decomposing attention  span of today's youth, then slowly eases the film into a more lingering and  abstract statement on the moral decay of society at large.Selena Gomez and Rachel Korine do well with what they have to work with. Vanessa  Hudgens, Ashley Benson and James Franco however knock their parts out of the  park. In particular Hudgens and Franco.Hudgens' Candy is so disconnected from reality that when a friend who she's known  since kindergarten is fearful for their lives and wants to go back home her first  instinct is to roll her eyes. Her constant finger gun shooting is very telling.  She wants to &#34;have fun&#34; and do whatever she wants no matter the cost. Life to her  is a video game. A movie. Drugs, alcohol, mindless robbing, unlimited money and  no consequences. Sound familiar? Almost like a description for the newest Grand  Theft Auto video game. This is her perception. This is how she makes the world  around her. This is her reality. A girl making out with another girl and dancing  raunchy is considered edgy and when she sees this happening at a party her  reaction is to gyrate around and scream in joy. Something that many girls would  do as well, but this is only a small glimpse into her psyche. It's not the act  that excites her it is the fact that it is edgy and considered by some to be  wrong. Money excites her because of the power it brings with it. She, several  times, becomes aroused in the presence of money. Of all the girls she is the one  who seems to be the first and most accepting of Alien and his lifestyle. After Cotty has been shot and tells Brit and Candy that spring break is over Candy  again seems to not care. Just as Faith wanting to go home this only interrupts  Candy's fun. She just wants this annoyance to be over. Get back to the fun stuff.  Get back to being bad.&#34;I always wanted to be bad.&#34; A statement made by Franco's Alien that completely  defines his character. Guns, drugs, money and power are his American Dream.  Alien's idea of having fun is robbing spring breakers and blowing tons of money  at strip clubs. He is gangster rap fully realized and defined. As he tells the  girls he is a hustler and a rapper. It is quite important that he lists them in  that order. It's as if being a rapper comes with the territory of being a hustler  and plays second fiddle to it. The idea that all gangsters and hustlers are also  rappers means he has to be one as well. Music is not his first love nor why he  does this. He just wants to be bad and rappers are &#34;bad&#34; so he must do it.  Scarface is the ultimate bad guy so it plays on repeat in his house. He surrounds  himself with what he sees as bad. The necessities of being a bad guy. Just as  when he is explaining his back story he says it's the same old sob story. It  doesn't matter. All that matters is being the baddest guy he can be. There  doesn't have to be a reason why other than he simply wants to be. This is his ultimate downfall.Spring Breakers is worth seeing for Franco's performance alone. Hudgens  performance, Harmony Korine's brilliant direction and hyper sensual style are  just the icing on the cake. After seeing this for the second time it only got  better. I expect the third time will only reveal more about this masterwork.10/10.",5,I always wanted to be bad.,1383264000,"11 1, 2013",2013,4698,"['would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'reading', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film.The', 'bright', 'sun', 'glistens', 'bright', 'blue', 'water', 'warm', 'sand', 'squishes', 'toes', 'Laughter', 'joyful', 'screams', 'fill', 'air', 'beer', 'funnel', 'full', 'again', ""'re"", 'up', 'next', '34', 'Woooo', '34', 'echoes', 'beach', 'Smiles', 'everyone', 'inviting', 'Spring', 'break', 'dream', 'Though', 'just', 'dreams', 'do', 'sure', 'come', 'abrupt', 'end', 'Bright', 'lights', 'neon', 'swim', 'wear', 'can', 'only', 'last', 'so', 'long', 'harsh', 'world', 'bounding', 'How', 'far', 'would', 'go', 'make', 'last', 'What', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'do', 'order', 'have', 'spring', 'break', 'forever', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'questions', 'Harmony', 'Korine', 'newest', 'effort', 'Spring', 'Breakers', 'A', 'study', 'youth', 'culture', 'today', 'how', 'amoral', 'corrupt', 'just', 'having', 'fun', 'can', 'become.Korine', 'nonlinear', 'editing', 'thing', 'genius', 'here', 'really', 'film', 'constant', 'foreshadowing', 'hints', 'future', 'assure', 'tension', 'never', 'up', 'view', 'never', 'able', 'be', 'ease', 'Something', ""n't"", 'right', 'here', 'Even', 'partying', 'seeming', 'happiness', 'something', 'darker', 'just', 'beneath', 'surface', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'laughter', 'smiles', 'Something', 'will', 'go', 'very', 'wrong', 'feeling', 'met', 'truth', 'film', 'unfolds', 'Korine', 'erratic', 'dubstep', 'music', 'quick', 'cuts', 'illustrate', 'ever', 'decomposing', 'attention', 'span', 'today', 'youth', 'then', 'slowly', 'film', 'more', 'lingering', 'abstract', 'statement', 'moral', 'decay', 'society', 'large.Selena', 'Gomez', 'Rachel', 'Korine', 'do', 'well', 'what', 'have', 'work', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'Ashley', 'Benson', 'James', 'Franco', 'however', 'knock', 'parts', 'park', 'particular', 'Hudgens', 'Franco.Hudgens', 'Candy', 'so', 'disconnected', 'reality', 'when', 'friend', 'who', 'known', 'kindergarten', 'fearful', 'lives', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'first', 'instinct', 'roll', 'eyes', 'constant', 'finger', 'gun', 'shooting', 'very', 'telling', '34', 'have', 'fun', '34', 'do', 'matter', 'cost', 'Life', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'Drugs', 'alcohol', 'mindless', 'robbing', 'unlimited', 'money', 'consequences', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'Almost', 'description', 'newest', 'Grand', 'Theft', 'Auto', 'video', 'game', 'perception', 'how', 'world', 'reality', 'girl', 'making', 'out', 'girl', 'dancing', 'raunchy', 'considered', 'edgy', 'when', 'happening', 'party', 'reaction', 'gyrate', 'scream', 'joy', 'Something', 'many', 'girls', 'would', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'small', 'glimpse', 'psyche', 'not', 'act', 'fact', 'edgy', 'considered', 'be', 'wrong', 'Money', 'power', 'several', 'times', 'becomes', 'aroused', 'presence', 'money', 'girls', 'one', 'who', 'be', 'first', 'most', 'accepting', 'Alien', 'lifestyle', 'Cotty', 'been', 'shot', 'tells', 'Brit', 'Candy', 'spring', 'break', 'Candy', 'again', 'not', 'care', 'Just', 'Faith', 'wanting', 'go', 'home', 'only', 'Candy', 'fun', 'just', 'annoyance', 'be', 'over', 'Get', 'back', 'fun', 'stuff', 'Get', 'back', 'being', 'bad.', '34', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'bad.', '34', 'statement', 'made', 'Franco', 'Alien', 'completely', 'character', 'Guns', 'drugs', 'money', 'power', 'are', 'American', 'Dream', 'Alien', 'idea', 'having', 'fun', 'robbing', 'spring', 'breakers', 'blowing', 'tons', 'money', 'strip', 'clubs', 'gangster', 'rap', 'fully', 'realized', 'defined', 'girls', 'hustler', 'rapper', 'quite', 'important', 'order', 'being', 'rapper', 'territory', 'being', 'hustler', 'second', 'fiddle', 'idea', 'gangsters', 'hustlers', 'are', 'also', 'rappers', 'be', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'Music', 'not', 'first', 'love', 'why', 'just', 'be', 'bad', 'rappers', 'are', '34', 'bad', '34', 'must', 'do', 'Scarface', 'ultimate', 'bad', 'guy', 'repeat', 'house', 'what', 'bad', 'necessities', 'being', 'bad', 'guy', 'Just', 'when', 'explaining', 'back', 'story', 'same', 'old', 'sob', 'story', ""n't"", 'matter', 'matters', 'being', 'baddest', 'guy', 'can', 'be', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'reason', 'why', 'other', 'simply', 'be', 'ultimate', 'downfall.Spring', 'Breakers', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Franco', 'performance', 'alone', 'Hudgens', 'performance', 'Harmony', 'Korine', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'hyper', 'sensual', 'style', 'are', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', 'seeing', 'second', 'time', 'only', 'got', 'better', 'expect', 'third', 'time', 'will', 'only', 'reveal', 'more', 'masterwork.10/10']",N/A

Of course it's ridiculous.  Of course it's obscene.  Of course it's unbelievable.  That's the point.  Korine uses hyperbole to show greed, apathy and amoral character of a segment of society that is completely without empathy.  These girls illustrate a generation that has grown up disconnected from other humans by computers, television, video games etc.  The fact that these girls see no moral problem in robbing etc is sort of the point.There is a fantastic scene when a Brittany Spears love ballad plays and the girls and Alien go on an obscene crime spree thats more like a gangsta rap cop killer video.  For me its a really great illustration of how these girls think.  In their minds they are living the Brittany Spears dream but in really life they are hurting people and putting themselves in grave danger.

But not all of them enjoy this trip full drugs, sex and alcohol. And when they get involved with a drug dealer named Alien (James Franco) everything changes.My Thoughts: This was the biggest let down of the year. The trailer made it look like the audience can expect a fun, fresh, provocative portrayal of the new generation, but it is definitely not! The movie is so stupid and senseless, I didn't care the tiniest bit for the four girls, and if it was up to me, they all should have died or gone to jail for being so dumb, which would be at least some kind of decent ending. Wow, we see Jennifer Hudgens as a bad girl... wooohoooo. I couldn't care less. The characters had no depth, development, nor had they been appealing in any way. Selena Gomez was probably the only one who delivered an okay performance, because she stuck with the innocent Disney - character, but the other three just seemed ridiculous. And what was up with James Franco as Alien? How would he even consider playing such an annoying role?This movie comes from the man who wrote the script for Kids which has been an eye-opening and very thought- provoking movie, but this movie is total bull$#!t and I think a ten year old could have written a better script.Stylish? No!Thought- provoking? No, but provoking my last nerves!Fresh? Of course not!Fun? More of a hell ride... and not in a good way!I admire the commercial success this movie had, but if you don't want to waste your time, I would suggest to watch something else.To see the more reviews please VISIT my blog [...] LIKE my Facebook page [...] and FOLLOW me on Twitter:  @SimonSays_Watch",1,Not good.,1374278400,"07 20, 2013",2013,1874,"['might', 'like', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'Kids', '1995', 'Project', 'X', '2009', 'Long', 'Story', 'Short', 'Four', 'suburban', 'college', 'girls', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'Ashley', 'Benson', 'Rachel', 'Korine', 'who', 'are', 'planning', 'going', 'spring', 'break', 'vacation', 'life', 'not', 'enjoy', 'trip', 'full', 'drugs', 'sex', 'alcohol', 'when', 'get', 'involved', 'drug', 'dealer', 'named', 'Alien', 'James', 'Franco', 'everything', 'changes.My', 'Thoughts', 'was', 'biggest', 'let', 'year', 'trailer', 'made', 'look', 'audience', 'can', 'expect', 'fun', 'fresh', 'provocative', 'portrayal', 'new', 'generation', 'definitely', 'not', 'movie', 'so', 'stupid', 'senseless', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'tiniest', 'bit', 'four', 'girls', 'was', 'up', 'should', 'have', 'died', 'gone', 'jail', 'being', 'so', 'dumb', 'would', 'be', 'least', 'kind', 'decent', 'ending', 'Wow', 'see', 'Jennifer', 'Hudgens', 'bad', 'girl', 'wooohoooo', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'characters', 'had', 'depth', 'development', 'had', 'been', 'appealing', 'way', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'was', 'probably', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'delivered', 'okay', 'performance', 'stuck', 'innocent', 'Disney', 'character', 'other', 'three', 'just', 'seemed', 'ridiculous', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'James', 'Franco', 'Alien', 'How', 'would', 'even', 'consider', 'playing', 'annoying', 'role', 'movie', 'man', 'who', 'wrote', 'script', 'Kids', 'been', 'eye-opening', 'very', 'thought-', 'provoking', 'movie', 'movie', 'total', 'bull', 't', 'think', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'could', 'have', 'written', 'better', 'script.Stylish', 'No', 'Thought-', 'provoking', 'No', 'provoking', 'last', 'nerves', 'Fresh', 'course', 'not', 'Fun', 'More', 'hell', 'ride', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'admire', 'commercial', 'success', 'movie', 'had', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'waste', 'time', 'would', 'suggest', 'watch', 'something', 'else.To', 'see', 'more', 'reviews', 'please', 'VISIT', 'blog', '[', ']', 'Facebook', 'page', '[', ']', 'FOLLOW', 'Twitter', '@', 'SimonSays_Watch']",N/A

1633239,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00BEJL4RO,Paul Allaer,"[9, 16]","""Spring Breakers"" (2013 release; 93 min.) is the latest movie from writer-director Harmony Korine, best known for writing the controversial 1995 movie ""Kids"" and his subsequent directorial debut ""Gummo"" a few years later. His latest project has been buzzed about for months, due mostly as a result of an intruiging premise: 4 girls, including once Disney TV ""good girls"" Vanessa Hudgens and Selena Gomez (the other 2 girls are played by Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine), descend on Florida for spring break and become ""bad girls"". As the movie starts, we see Selma's character (Faith) as being ""the shy one"", while the other girls are ready to rock, except they don't have any money. The three girls decide to rob a fast food/diner-type using a fake gun and a hammer, and pull it off. Once in Florida, all four party it up (and up and up). A few days into their spring break stay, a party goes out of bounds and the girls are arrested for drug use. They don't have the money to bail out, but a local rapper-gangsta called Alien (played by an almost unrecognizable James Franco) decides to put up the bail money. At that point we are about 40 min. into the movie, and to tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: I felt the movie started off quite tentatively, if not predictable. The highlight of the first half of the movie is easily the robbery of the fast food/diner, as Korine films it from the outside (riding along in the pickup truck of the girls), and we watch as the girls intimidate/threathen the diner's customers for money. As the girls settle in for spring break and the partying goes on and on, I felt the movie needed a jolt to provide it some direction. As if by magic, that is when James Franco comes in and takes the movie to another level, and correlating, we slide away from the non-stop frat boys parties to the real story of the movie (sorry, don't want to reveal more). What to make of the ""bad girl"" performances of Hudgens and Gomez? Let me just say that Hudgens gets the far better end of that deal, and comes across far more realistic and believable than does Gomez. At one point in the movie, the James Franco character tells her ""you're so pretty, but you look like you're only 15"", and right he is, she does look like she's 15, and not just being ""the shy one"" but also ""the weak/scared one"". If this is Gomez's idea of an ""image change"", she may have misfired badly.The music plays a huge role in the movie. Skrillex and Cliff Martinez scored the original soundtrack, and it sounds great. But there is plenty of other music in the movie. For some reason, Britney Spears gets big ""thumbs up"" (at one point, the 4 girls start singing ""...Baby One More Time"" and later in the movie Britney's ""Everytime"" comes at a key moment). But there are also songs from the Black Keys and Ellie Goulding, just to name those (""Lights"" plays over the end credits). Bottom line, ""Spring Breakers"" is an intruiging, if ultimately flawed movie (mainly because of the first half of the movie), but the second half of the movie has enough interesting elements to it that I can recommend this, warts and all.",4,"3.5 stars... intriguing, if flawed, movie",1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,3212,"['Spring', 'Breakers', '2013', 'release', '93', 'min', 'latest', 'movie', 'writer-director', 'Harmony', 'Korine', 'best', 'known', 'writing', 'controversial', '1995', 'movie', 'Kids', 'subsequent', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Gummo', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'latest', 'project', 'been', 'buzzed', 'months', 'due', 'mostly', 'result', 'intruiging', 'premise', '4', 'girls', 'including', 'once', 'Disney', 'TV', 'good', 'girls', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'other', '2', 'girls', 'are', 'played', 'Ashley', 'Benson', 'Rachel', 'Korine', 'descend', 'Florida', 'spring', 'break', 'become', 'bad', 'girls', 'movie', 'see', 'Selma', 'character', 'Faith', 'being', 'shy', 'one', 'other', 'girls', 'are', 'ready', 'rock', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'three', 'girls', 'decide', 'rob', 'fast', 'food/diner-type', 'using', 'fake', 'gun', 'hammer', 'pull', 'off', 'Once', 'Florida', 'four', 'party', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'few', 'days', 'spring', 'break', 'stay', 'party', 'bounds', 'girls', 'are', 'arrested', 'drug', 'use', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'bail', 'out', 'local', 'rapper-gangsta', 'called', 'Alien', 'played', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'James', 'Franco', 'put', 'up', 'bail', 'money', 'point', 'are', '40', 'min', 'movie', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Several', 'comments', 'felt', 'movie', 'started', 'off', 'quite', 'tentatively', 'not', 'predictable', 'highlight', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'easily', 'robbery', 'fast', 'food/diner', 'Korine', 'films', 'outside', 'riding', 'along', 'pickup', 'truck', 'girls', 'watch', 'girls', 'intimidate/threathen', 'diner', 'customers', 'money', 'girls', 'settle', 'spring', 'break', 'partying', 'felt', 'movie', 'needed', 'jolt', 'provide', 'direction', 'magic', 'when', 'James', 'Franco', 'movie', 'level', 'correlating', 'slide', 'away', 'non-stop', 'frat', 'parties', 'real', 'story', 'movie', 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'more', 'What', 'make', 'bad', 'girl', 'performances', 'Hudgens', 'Gomez', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'Hudgens', 'far', 'better', 'end', 'deal', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'believable', 'Gomez', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'James', 'Franco', 'character', ""'re"", 'so', 'pretty', 'look', ""'re"", 'only', '15', 'right', 'look', '15', 'not', 'just', 'being', 'shy', 'one', 'also', 'weak/scared', 'one', 'Gomez', 'idea', 'image', 'change', 'may', 'have', 'misfired', 'badly.The', 'music', 'huge', 'role', 'movie', 'Skrillex', 'Cliff', 'Martinez', 'scored', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'plenty', 'other', 'music', 'movie', 'reason', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'big', 'up', 'one', 'point', '4', 'girls', 'start', 'singing', 'Baby', 'One', 'More', 'Time', 'later', 'movie', 'Britney', 'Everytime', 'key', 'moment', 'are', 'also', 'songs', 'Black', 'Keys', 'Ellie', 'Goulding', 'just', 'name', 'Lights', 'end', 'credits', 'Bottom', 'line', 'Spring', 'Breakers', 'intruiging', 'ultimately', 'flawed', 'movie', 'mainly', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'enough', 'interesting', 'elements', 'can', 'recommend', 'warts']",N/A

I knew Selena Gomez was gonna be the church goin one who would not involve herself in all the sinning that was going on but I figured maybe she'll surprise me. I was expecting a raunchy teenage movie, but after watching this that's putting it lightly. So you have Vanessa Hudgens, Selena Gomez & 2 other girls I don't know, they all attend some small college in the middle of nowhere. It's that time of the year when all the young college types go down to Florida & let loose, only problem is that Vanessa & her friends don't have enough money for the trip so then, we're 4 young smart college girls, how do we get this money? A bikini carwash, no that would take too much work & we need this money right now. I know, lets rob someone or someone's. So then, now that we have the money, onward let's go. The girls make it to Florida & start doing what young college girls do, party & tease all the horny guys lookin to get laid. They somehow end up at a party in the hotel they're staying at which gets raided by the local cops, it seems there is other girls there but when the cops show up they seem to be the only ones that get arrested. In comes James Franco who for this movie is playing a wannabe black drug dealer gangster, he springs our four main characters from jail. Franco lives in a lavish looking home with cash all over the place but for some reason drives a crappy junk looking Camaro. He seems to think these 4 girls have potential even though they've done absolutely nothing to show him that. Now this movie could've gone in various directions at this point but the director had a small budget to work with so let's keep it simple. He takes them to a pool hall where all the local black drug dealers hang out to have some fun, no not that kind of fun, really, just playing pool. I honestly think that the script for this movie probably started out a certain way, but then Selena Gomez read it & said ""No, i'm a Disney sweetheart, I can not allow anyone who doesn't match Beiber's eloquence to even get close to this"". So then her part in the movie was re-written to keep her pure & free of sin. She's visibly creeped out in the pool hall at the site of all these shirtless gangsta black guys she kept referring to as ""These People"" saying I do not want them touching me. The other three girls didn't have a problem with anything so then, Selena takes her leave & heads back to pure small town America where she clearly belongs. Franco enlist his remaining 3 new friends in a series of robberies of other drug dealers & such & everything is awesome until the town kingpin gets wind of what's going on & gives him an ultimatum to get out of town, shooting one of his female soldiers in the process. Well we can't have that, who do these black guys think they are? So then, the girl who got shot gets scared & decides to tuck in her tail & run, no such thing for Hudgens & the remaining girl. They along with Franco go get revenge pulling up to Mr Bigs house in a cig boat & when Franco is shot down right away, Hudgens & the other girl rampage the house killing everyone, & then kill Mr Big & then steal his Lambo to boot just like in some kinda Saints Row videogame, that's it. Now remember, these are just regular girls with no formal defensive or weapons training & yet they take down all of these thugs with relative ease. There now you don't have to waste 2 hours of your life watching this horrible flick. Now if your drunk with friends & just want some background noise during a house party then this may work. The movie had lots of T&A only problem was that barely any of it was of our 4 main characters. Gomez other than being in a bikini, which she looked pretty sexy in, never shows anything. Of the other girls, there were a few hints of breast but that's it. I mean there's the pool scene but they're so hugged up on eachother you don't see anything.

From the guns to the grill, from the car to the house, Franco brings an imaginary character to life and makes you believe he really is ""living the American Dream"".  My favorite scene is where Franco is in his bedroom talking about all of his ""shit"" haha - absolutely hilarious!  Got to take my hat off for this performance.What I hated:&#9679; The Britney Spears scene between Franco and the three remaining girls&#9679; Gucci Mane - I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of Gucci and I am glad that I didn't.  I am surprised that Harmony Korine gave him as big of a role as he did.  I went in thinking Gucci would be playing a rapper and have like 1 minute screen time, tops.  I was wrong.  Korine casted Gucci in a role opposite of Franco, where he is vastly out shined, due to the fact that Gucci can't speak and sounds overly scripted (when you are able to understand him)&#9679; The ending, which may be one of the worst in the history of film cinema - I could probably write an entire paragraph on why I hated it, but I think that would just be a waste of time.Everything else aside, this film found a way to keep me entertained throughout (up until the end).  Looking back on it now, I feel as though I almost became lost in the entire art aspect of the film and was therefore able to ignore the ""bad"" plot that so many others have pointed out.

What you'll get instead is a sobering cautionary tale about four sexy coeds who get more than they bargained for when they head down to St. Petes for a week of fun-and-games in the Florida sun.The allegorically named Faith (Selena Gomez) is a good Christian girl who yearns for a chance to break free of the confines of her tedious college life and thinks spring break the way to do it. The problem is that she and her three girlfriends don't have enough money to make the trip. So they opt to steal a car and hold up a diner, then use their ill-gotten gains to get them to where they want to go. After a few days getting stoned and plastered, the girls find themselves in jail with no one to bail them out. Enter &#34;Alien&#34; (James Franco), an uber-creepy street hustler with a mouth full of silver teeth who posts the money they need on the condition they spend some time with him. What is he up to, and can a venture that started on such a violent note end on anything but?The thing &#34;Spring Breakers&#34; has most going for it is its total lack of predictability, for just as you think you know where it's headed, it turns right around and goes off in a different direction entirely. The girls remain strangely underdeveloped and undifferentiated throughout (except for Selena), but, in a way, that's perfectly in keeping with the theme of female objectification that permeates the work.Writer/director Harmony Korine has conceived the work almost as a tone-poem, with long lyrical stretches punctuated periodically by the sound of a cocking rifle. That symbol for the ever-looming threat of violence serves as the refrain for the story the movie is telling. Some of the scenes are astonishingly realistic, while others have an almost hallucinatory quality to them. This makes it so that we don't really question the plausibility of some of the plot choices Korine makes. It's all in the service of the thesis that there's a yearning &#34;to be bad&#34; lurking deep inside each and every one of us. All it needs is that one special circumstance to set it free.&#34;Spring Breakers&#34; is one of those odd films that keeps hammering us with titillating visuals, while at the same time warning us against the dangers of partaking in what it's showing us.It may make you depressed about the youth of today and make you despair over the future of the nation, but, love it or hate it, as a movie, &#34;Spring Breakers&#34; is definitely a one-of-a-kind experience.",4,Not what you might expect,1383177600,"10 31, 2013",2013,2595,"['go', '34', 'Spring', 'Breakers', '34', 'expecting', 'dumbed-down', 'flesh-jiggling', 'sex', 'romp', 'may', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'What', ""'ll"", 'get', 'instead', 'sobering', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'four', 'sexy', 'coeds', 'who', 'get', 'more', 'bargained', 'when', 'head', 'St.', 'Petes', 'week', 'fun-and-games', 'Florida', 'sun.The', 'allegorically', 'named', 'Faith', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'good', 'Christian', 'girl', 'who', 'chance', 'break', 'free', 'confines', 'tedious', 'college', 'life', 'spring', 'break', 'way', 'do', 'problem', 'three', 'girlfriends', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'make', 'trip', 'opt', 'steal', 'car', 'hold', 'up', 'diner', 'then', 'use', 'ill-gotten', 'gains', 'get', 'where', 'want', 'go', 'few', 'days', 'getting', 'stoned', 'plastered', 'girls', 'find', 'jail', 'one', 'bail', 'out', 'Enter', '34', 'Alien', '34', 'James', 'Franco', 'uber-creepy', 'street', 'hustler', 'mouth', 'full', 'silver', 'teeth', 'who', 'posts', 'money', 'need', 'condition', 'spend', 'time', 'What', 'up', 'can', 'venture', 'started', 'violent', 'note', 'end', 'anything', 'thing', '34', 'Spring', 'Breakers', '34', 'most', 'going', 'total', 'lack', 'predictability', 'just', 'think', 'know', 'where', 'headed', 'right', 'off', 'different', 'direction', 'entirely', 'girls', 'remain', 'strangely', 'underdeveloped', 'undifferentiated', 'Selena', 'way', 'perfectly', 'keeping', 'theme', 'female', 'objectification', 'work.Writer/director', 'Harmony', 'Korine', 'conceived', 'work', 'almost', 'tone-poem', 'long', 'lyrical', 'stretches', 'punctuated', 'periodically', 'sound', 'cocking', 'rifle', 'symbol', 'ever-looming', 'threat', 'violence', 'serves', 'refrain', 'story', 'movie', 'telling', 'scenes', 'are', 'astonishingly', 'realistic', 'others', 'have', 'almost', 'hallucinatory', 'quality', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'question', 'plausibility', 'plot', 'choices', 'Korine', 'service', 'thesis', 'yearning', '34', 'be', 'bad', '34', 'lurking', 'deep', 'one', 'All', 'one', 'special', 'circumstance', 'set', 'free.', '34', 'Spring', 'Breakers', '34', 'one', 'odd', 'films', 'keeps', 'hammering', 'titillating', 'visuals', 'same', 'time', 'warning', 'dangers', 'partaking', 'what', 'showing', 'us.It', 'may', 'make', 'depressed', 'youth', 'today', 'make', 'despair', 'future', 'nation', 'love', 'hate', 'movie', '34', 'Spring', 'Breakers', '34', 'definitely', 'one-of-a-kind', 'experience']",N/A

I think Selena is one of the most beautiful women in the world (that I've had the fortune to see).  Her acting is still a little stilted, stereotyped, because she's still finding her acting ""legs"".  Her music is good, and the kids seem to like it.  I find it better than average, but again she needs a bit of tweaking.  For the awful plot of this movie and its bling-like role-playing, I think she could have done better to ""break out"" of her ""goody-two-shoes"" reputation from Disney.  Still, at least she isn't doing a Lohan that I've heard of so far.  She seems to have a good head on her shoulders despite Hollywood's pressures and false ""coolness"".  I hope she stays well-grounded, and that this minimal role will be just a brief bump in the road.  She has talent, and seems to be a good person besides.  Hollywood can corrupt even a saint.  So I wish her well, and though this movie has a little bit of ""sexy"" in it (bikini girls), I find it no more than ok.  Nothing special.  Typical shoot-em-up with some diverting gore that destroys any quality it might have had.  As a vet, I don't care to see more killing and viciousness from criminals.

1633284,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,B00BEJL4RO,Scrimshaw,"[2, 5]","I just finished watching Spring Breakers and I have to honestly say it was amazing. Many people saw the trailers and thought it was going to be fast-paced, funny, action-packed, and cool, but it was actually very dark, confusing, boring, and repetitive. It's basically Harmony Korine showing us that the ""spring break"" world portrayed on MTV and Girls Gone Wild is not real, as in a dream world. Despite all the bright neon colors, beautiful cinematography, and hot beach babes looking like something straight out of a music video the film is incredibly dark and disturbing, just like the real ""world"" of Spring Break. It's quite a cinematic accomplishment if I do say so myself. The film is rich with symbolism and metaphor and it took a while for me to fully grasp and understand it all. The James Franco character ""Alien"" is so named because he's living in a different world, the dark real ""world"" of spring break devoid of the humor, action, and coolness you were expecting, and what many college kids who seek after this world end up discovering. His sole purpose is to wake them up from the dreamworld, to guide them back to reality.He seems cruel and evil, but deep down there is a kindhearted tenderness you wouldn't expect from a guy like him, which is illustrated many times throughout the film, most notably during the scene at the piano when the haunting Britney Spears song ""Everytime"" plays. The truth is, in reality he wasn't the villain, but the hero of the film, perhaps even an angel sent to guide them, who ""dies"" when he realizes that the last two girls are never going to wake up.  Selena Gomez's character ""Faith"" is the closest to the light of god and heaven and because of her innate spirituality, or ""Faith"", she has the intuition to see that ""something"" bad is going to happen. She leaves early on, not wanting to descend into this different world, a world that only she can see for it's true nature. She tries to warn her friends, tries to wake them up, but they're still asleep and all she can do is hope they wake up before it's too late. Regarding the scene towards the end involving the remaining two girls, this properly illustrates this point. They've descended so deep into the dream world they're no longer even willing, it seems, to wake up from it even though we the viewers can clearly see it's not real, and it's THESE very people that you see on Spring Break Fever and Girls Gone Wild, the dreamers who are still fast asleep. And regarding how you never learn the fates of the final two girls, played by Vanessa Hudgens and Rachel Korine, that was actually an incredibly smart move on Harmony's part, because it really doesn't matter, of course you can assume all kinds of things like they get caught and arrested or even killed but that wasn't the main point. The main ""point"" is that they're trapped in the dreamworld, and this film shows the dark fate of those that never wake up and begin living in the real world. In the end, while I do appreciate the art-house quality of the movie and understand what it is was trying to say, the message itself is so dark and depressing that I can't award it a full five stars.

1633285,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B00BEJL4RO,S. Der,"[1, 7]","I never seen such a movie that has over 1,400 reviews saying this movie sucks!!! This movie has only 200, 5 stars positive reviews. That's nothing compared to the negative reviews.  So, as you see can by many bad reviews, if you watch this, you already know, this movie will most likely have you hating it at the end! That is because nothing about this movie was worth wild to see.However, I wanted to give it a shot. So, I actually did watch it, and form my own opinion about it. So, to me, it is a Girls Gone Wild video without all the nudity in it. There isn't much of a story to tell and the simple story doesn't seem to go anywhere. You are basically paying to watch a pimp having his way with these young, messed up girls. There was 4 girls that went on the spring break trip, but only 3 girls stayed there after spring break with the pimp. The smarter one Selena Gomez, left because she was the only smart sensible one in the bunch.It really seemed like these girls have no meaning in their lives, so they are trying to figure that out, but not in a good way. They do it by partying, drug use, and a whole lot of sex. It looks like they're looking towards the pimp as their life coach, which they also have sex with him. Also, the pimp gets the girls to do a murder job with him, which is the supposed to be the highlight of the movie. WTF? That's their climax. This really is a crappy movie! What's the point really for him to do this big murder you ask? Well, it's because he wants to prove that he a true boss to others. I wasn't impressed.In the end, the movie was never good. I did regret watching it and if you want to just watch this for the girls in bikinis with little story, then be my guest. This is probably for you anyways. There's nothing but that and there's no directions from it. To add, with the really poor acting skills they have will be a perfect match for this movie.

I can't imagine how or why it made money. It is absolute rubbish---zero plot and utterly misogynistic.  It is offensive in every way. It has no script, it has no plot, it has no real cinematography.This movie presents all young women as slutty and all black males as thugs and drug dealers.  Besides Piranha 2, it is the worst movie I've ever seen. Do NOT believe the 5-star reviews claiming that all the low reviews are the result of ""not understanding the subtle genius"" of this movie. That's utter nonsense. I'm a student of cinema, I go to indie movie houses all the time, and this film has no redeeming creative qualities.And Franco's alleged ""brilliant"" performance?  No chance. They cornrow his hair, they laquer his teeth, they stick a pair of 70s shades on his face, they dress him gangsta, they give him cheap, silly dialogue. But what makes Franco so appealing is that he doesn't need all that stuff; his expressive face exudes a powerful inner pain and torment far beyond his years. Heck, he's at his best in a pair of ratty jeans and a black t-shirt, not disguised as some LA rapper.The 4 female leads aren't in Franco's acting league. But they are not bad actresses. They do have potential that is never explored here. I don't think you ever see them not in bikinis, which means the director had no faith in their acting abilities.The beach footage shows acres of bikini-clad women, with a sprinkling of men. Yeah, get real. Here's what spring break is really like: 10 drunken guys to every girl and if you're lucky enough to have a girl talk to you, it's because she wants to soak you for free booze.Final word?

If you mesh tons of explicit content together this doesn't automatically qualify it as art. This film is way way out of mainstream and it really surprises me that it received a wide release. It does not appeal to a wide audience and most people will be shocked and hate it. Others will appreciate it but in all sense it is not a likable film. It is very disturbing in parts and overall powerful but very uncomfortable. The film is thoroughly broken but that is what makes an exploitation film an exploitation film, it embraces it's flaws.The film differs greatly from it's trailer as it is not a lighthearted, trashy, ""Project X"" on spring break. Most people going into this film probably expected that and were disappointed when presented with a quality, thought-worthy film. Harmony Korine gave a real slap in the face to people who expected that. Going into this film I knew of Korine's other works and knew this was going to be no different. The film is dark with a menacing and uncomfortable feel throughout.Many criticisms of this film are of flaws that were done intentionally. Such as the repetitive dialogue or overly innocent main characters. The acting is excellent as all the actors are out of their comfort zone and deliver. The cinematography, as always, is beautifully artistic. This film most likely went over the majority of peoples heads who gave it a negative review. It's a thought-provoking social commentary that delivers on all levels. I don't want to give any of it away as you need to dissect it yourself.This film is certainly not for everyone and is an unpleasant watch.

Spring Breakers is supposed to be one Seth Rogen cameo away from being the new Pineapple Express, but oh how far away from comedy this movie is.

1633298,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,B00BEJL4RO,Steven Johnson,"[5, 11]","I am probably just as surprised as you are: Spring Breakers is actually a really good movie.It follows a deceptively simple plot, of a Good Girl and her longtime friends, three Bad Girls, who are bored in their university setting and are desperate for any kind of change. Their solution is to go to Florida for a wild and unforgettable Spring Break. Even after saving money for months, they are unable to afford this excursion, prompting the Bad Girls to rob a local eatery.The bad behavior continues at the Spring Break resort town, eventually landing them in a local jail and involved in a greater crime ring. One of the drug lords is played to over-the-top perfection by James Franco, who delivers a chilling yet comical portrayal.The story is told with an engaging intensity unique to films of this genre; we've seen plenty of movies like this before, of young girls gone wild, so the direction doesn't waste time on the narrative. What's interesting is how the story is told, through lucid montages flashing around through time and space, often with disembodied voice-overs describing the sequence we are viewing, as told by characters before or after the incident actually takes place.Take one scene, for instance: We know the girls are going to get into trouble. We knew that from the movie poster. So for the scene in which they get arrested, we get flashes of the different girls in police cars with red and blue lights shining on their faces; then we return back to the incident in which they get arrested. This constant back-and-forth makes this movie, whose narrative is otherwise simple, consistently compelling.But it's not just the storytelling that makes Spring Breakers a fascinating work, but the story and theme itself. Simple, yes, but also profound. This is a twisted representation of the American dream, almost a contemporary remake of Where the Boys Are, of young women rejecting mainstream society and opt to make a life for themselves in any way they can. The plays of power move so instantaneously and so driven by individual initiative, that one can't watch without the unsettling feeling that power, and perceptions of it, are so fluid.On its surface, Spring Breakers is a sticky, neon trip of house music and marijuana smoke but at its heart (or lack of one), it is a disturbing and revealing look at what we value in our American life, and how far we will go to achieve it.",5,"Disturbing & Unforgettable, but Definitely Not for Everyone",1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,2404,"['am', 'probably', 'just', 'as', 'surprised', 'are', 'Spring', 'Breakers', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'movie.It', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'plot', 'Good', 'Girl', 'longtime', 'friends', 'three', 'Bad', 'Girls', 'who', 'are', 'bored', 'university', 'setting', 'are', 'desperate', 'kind', 'change', 'solution', 'go', 'Florida', 'wild', 'unforgettable', 'Spring', 'Break', 'Even', 'saving', 'money', 'months', 'are', 'unable', 'afford', 'excursion', 'prompting', 'Bad', 'Girls', 'rob', 'local', 'eatery.The', 'bad', 'behavior', 'Spring', 'Break', 'resort', 'town', 'eventually', 'landing', 'local', 'jail', 'involved', 'greater', 'crime', 'ring', 'One', 'drug', 'lords', 'played', 'over-the-top', 'perfection', 'James', 'Franco', 'who', 'chilling', 'yet', 'comical', 'portrayal.The', 'story', 'told', 'engaging', 'intensity', 'unique', 'films', 'genre', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'movies', 'young', 'girls', 'gone', 'wild', 'direction', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'narrative', 'What', 'interesting', 'how', 'story', 'told', 'lucid', 'montages', 'flashing', 'time', 'space', 'often', 'disembodied', 'voice-overs', 'describing', 'sequence', 'are', 'viewing', 'told', 'characters', 'incident', 'actually', 'place.Take', 'one', 'scene', 'instance', 'know', 'girls', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'trouble', 'knew', 'movie', 'poster', 'So', 'scene', 'get', 'arrested', 'get', 'flashes', 'different', 'girls', 'police', 'cars', 'red', 'blue', 'lights', 'shining', 'then', 'return', 'back', 'incident', 'get', 'arrested', 'constant', 'back-and-forth', 'movie', 'narrative', 'otherwise', 'simple', 'consistently', 'not', 'just', 'storytelling', 'Spring', 'Breakers', 'fascinating', 'work', 'story', 'theme', 'Simple', 'yes', 'also', 'profound', 'twisted', 'representation', 'American', 'dream', 'almost', 'contemporary', 'remake', 'Where', 'Boys', 'Are', 'young', 'women', 'rejecting', 'mainstream', 'society', 'opt', 'make', 'life', 'way', 'can', 'plays', 'power', 'move', 'so', 'instantaneously', 'so', 'driven', 'individual', 'initiative', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'unsettling', 'feeling', 'power', 'perceptions', 'are', 'so', 'fluid.On', 'surface', 'Spring', 'Breakers', 'sticky', 'neon', 'trip', 'house', 'music', 'marijuana', 'smoke', 'heart', 'lack', 'one', 'disturbing', 'revealing', 'look', 'what', 'value', 'American', 'life', 'how', 'far', 'will', 'go', 'achieve']",N/A

This movie was VERY well done with the camera work, the actors/actresses did a good job portraying themselves as stereotype people that you pretty much see today in the real world and actually poke fun of it at the same time. Sure the four girls who star in this movie are probably not you're favorite actresses but don't let that bother you since this is not some reality TV E! movie or some crap. The movie does a good job showing how sick and boring the real world is when everybody is stuck in the same 24/7 routine and bends a little bit into the fantasy type world of being showered in money and fame. I really don't understand why there is alot of hate in this movie but Once i started reading some of the bad reviews, it is clearly obvious those bad reviewers are the same type of people that think adam sandler movies like ""grown up"" is the best comedy movie of all time or they think the fast and the furious movies are the greatest action films of all time which is absolutely hilarious, so I chose to ignore those type of reviewers and I was glad I did because Spring Breakers will actually surprised you if you give it a chance. Plus Spring Breakers is a brilliant example of saying ""you may hate this movie but at the same time you will love it"" if you know what I mean. The awesome bright neon lights, the superb raw energy and a great cultural reality check type of movie as well. It is worth watching once and of course this is not the movie of the year or whatnot. Also, the director of Spring Breakers was also the writer for the underrated controversial ""Kids"" movie back in 1995 and even THAT movie got bad reviews by religious people/parents but turned out to be a great wake up movie for people who actually enjoy watching movies without being so damn judgemental. Plus, he directed ""Gummo"" as well.

The cinematography is excellent but anyone whose been through these forced days of drunkenness, stupidity and drugs knows the down-times exist within a lot of pseudo-spontaneighty and everybody hugs everybody when ur high. So ""SpringBreak"" exists as a state of mind vis-a-vis 'escape.'Here there is LOTS of ""feeling"" shots: young girls hugging, kissing, you get the feeling there's commiserating and affection thats real, but not enough writing talent to bring it. Nonstop cinematic warm-fuzzies without words.We forgive that and join the girls as they drink, dance, flirt - maybe have some sex (?) and snort coke, the latter landing them in jail, only to have their fines paid by a local-drug lord-rapper with a mansion and millions.James Franco is GREAT as a slimy creation that anyone with half-a-brain would run from, and Gomez' character appears to be the only one with such an organ functioning.Gomez senses these are not the people to be with and goes home. Too bad, she was terrific, and actually had lines that helped to define A CHARACTER; something very unusual in this movie.One of the remaining girls gets wounded in a drive-by and also goes home, but here the other two TAKE A HUGE TURN and become gangsters cinemetography-wise like at the end like Tropic Thunder, killing everyone ala Natural Born Killers. In those movies, we get a feeling for those characters that matches up with their actions; even ridiculous ones as in Tropic Thunder.

I bought this movie today and I had watched this movie on its opening day in theaters and I remember enjoying the movie and was able to see what the movie was truly about.Prior to seeing this movie, the only movie I had watched of Harmony Korine's that I had seen was ""Kids,"" and he wrote the script for that movie, but he didn't direct it. Before today, the only other movie I had seen of his was ""Gummo"" which I kind of enjoyed even though I saw that it was a really weird movie.Now I remember what led me to seeing this movie was the amount of curiosity I had for it. I remember seeing some promotional pictures and some set pictures of the four girls in bikinis and it enticed me to see it. Then I watched the trailer on YouTube which made me realize what kind of movie this was going to be, especially after seeing who directed it. I had a feeling that it was going to be a stylish indie flick that was also a social commentary.I didn't expect this to be a typical party movie. I knew what I was getting going into this movie. However, that isn't to say that I didn't see any flaws in it. I remember when I saw it, I somehow found James Franco's character to be a little annoying but after seeing it for the second time today, I saw that he played that role well. I also have to hand it to Selena Gomez for trying to break out of her Disney image. Too bad she left halfway through the movie.Overall, all I can say is that if you want to watch this, you have to know what you're getting yourself into and that this was never meant to be a party comedy to begin with. Also, for fans of independent cinema, I recommend it. I felt that the movie got a little better for me after the first time I saw it. I liked it enough to buy it, now I feel that it's a little better than my first viewing of it. That's all I can say.

Four college friends are determined to make it to Florida for spring break this year. After saving up for many months they are still short cash for the trip. When one of them comes up with an idea to make money in an illegal way they decide that is the only way, this decision begins to change the girls way of thinking and when they meet Alien (Franco) things get even more out of control. Some can handle it and some can't. I have to start off by saying that this movie is pretty much exactly what you would expect from a movie called Spring Breakers. Lots of drug use, drinking and nudity. For a movie like this to have the cast it does makes the movie more intriguing to see (for me anyway) and they all do a good job in it that you forget who you are watching. The movie started off pretty exciting, the middle really drug but the ending makes you glad you stuck with it.

1633327,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00BEJL4RO,Turfseer,"[3, 5]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Spring Breakers' can best be summed up as a mixed bag. On the positive side, this is a film with some excellent cinematography and editing as well as a surprisingly good performance by James Franco, as a tough as nails drug dealer.The story, on the other hand, is problematic. We're introduced to four attractive female college students, who are bored to death attending school and believe that their salvation lies in going on a spring break to St. Petersburg, Florida, where all the action supposedly is. Only one of the girls, Faith (Selena Gomez), a member of a church group, appears to have any conscience at all. Some of her friends try to warn her about the other three, but probably due to peer pressure and probably because she's a bit of an airhead herself, she decides to join them on the spring break.The only problem is that the girls don't have enough money to go to Florida. So Faith's friends put on masks and using squirt guns, rob a fast food outlet and obtain the necessary cash. For almost the next half hour, nothing much happens, as there are numerous shots of the girls partying with other out of control spring breakers.The girls are finally arrested and lucky not to be hit with drug charges (as drugs were found in the house they were in). Nonetheless the judge tells them if they can't pay a fine for what appears to be disorderly conduct, they'll be jailed for two days. James Franco as 'Alien', bails the girls out and he introduces them to the scary drug scene he's part of. Franco is unrecognizable as Alien, sporting a set of silver metal braces on his teeth. Franco is quite convincing as Alien the drug dealer, with his menacing demeanor and thirst for violence. Faith is scared by Alien's lifestyle and decides to return back home.The other three girls remain with Alien and like Charlie Manson's girls, decide to join him in his life of crime. Alien's rival is another scary drug dealer, 'Big Arch', who threatens to kill him on more than one occasion. The girls commit a number of robberies with Alien and then one of them, Cotty, is shot in the arm by one of Big Arch's girlfriends, in a drive-by shooting. Now demoralized, she too decides to leave the group.The end of Spring Breakers proves to be completely ridiculous. Alien and the two remaining girls, decide to assassinate Big Arch at his island lair. Instead of trying to shoot Big Arch where he's accessible, we're asked to believe that Alien takes a speed boat out to his rival's island retreat and assisted by the girls, go up against Big Arch and an armed posse of at least six or seven bodyguards. Sure enough, Alien is gunned down as soon as he steps off the boat; but the girls, in slow motion, shoot the bodyguards and then gun down Big Arch, while he's inside, in his sauna (I wonder why Big Arch didn't hear the gunfire outside, before he's dispatched).So the two bad girls go on their merry way, back to school, and the two drug dealers, meet a dismal end. The conceit that these two girls would so easily be able to kill all these dangerous criminals, is of course, absurd. Only the slick production values coupled with the Franco performance, saves the film, which notably has little character development (except for Franco's part). 'Spring Breakers' is worth seeing for the visual experience but don't expect much of a brain massage at all.",3,Girls Gone Wild meet The Manson Family in this tawdry but watchable Franco vehicle,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,3391,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'Spring"", 'Breakers', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'mixed', 'bag', 'positive', 'side', 'film', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'as', 'well', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performance', 'James', 'Franco', 'tough', 'nails', 'drug', 'dealer.The', 'story', 'other', 'hand', 'problematic', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'four', 'attractive', 'female', 'college', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'bored', 'death', 'attending', 'school', 'believe', 'salvation', 'going', 'spring', 'break', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'Florida', 'where', 'action', 'supposedly', 'Only', 'one', 'girls', 'Faith', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'member', 'church', 'group', 'have', 'conscience', 'friends', 'try', 'warn', 'other', 'three', 'probably', 'due', 'peer', 'pressure', 'probably', 'bit', 'airhead', 'herself', 'join', 'spring', 'break.The', 'only', 'problem', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'go', 'Florida', 'So', 'Faith', 'friends', 'put', 'masks', 'using', 'squirt', 'guns', 'rob', 'fast', 'food', 'outlet', 'obtain', 'necessary', 'cash', 'almost', 'next', 'half', 'hour', 'nothing', 'much', 'are', 'numerous', 'shots', 'girls', 'partying', 'other', 'control', 'spring', 'breakers.The', 'girls', 'are', 'finally', 'arrested', 'lucky', 'not', 'be', 'hit', 'drug', 'charges', 'drugs', 'were', 'found', 'house', 'were', 'judge', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pay', 'fine', 'what', 'be', 'disorderly', 'conduct', ""'ll"", 'be', 'jailed', 'two', 'days', 'James', 'Franco', ""'Alien"", 'girls', 'out', 'scary', 'drug', 'scene', 'part', 'Franco', 'unrecognizable', 'Alien', 'sporting', 'set', 'silver', 'metal', 'braces', 'teeth', 'Franco', 'quite', 'convincing', 'Alien', 'drug', 'dealer', 'menacing', 'demeanor', 'thirst', 'violence', 'Faith', 'scared', 'Alien', 'lifestyle', 'return', 'back', 'home.The', 'other', 'three', 'girls', 'remain', 'Alien', 'Charlie', 'Manson', 'girls', 'decide', 'join', 'life', 'crime', 'Alien', 'rival', 'scary', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Arch', 'who', 'kill', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'girls', 'commit', 'number', 'robberies', 'Alien', 'then', 'one', 'Cotty', 'shot', 'arm', 'one', 'Big', 'Arch', 'girlfriends', 'drive-by', 'shooting', 'Now', 'demoralized', 'too', 'leave', 'group.The', 'end', 'Spring', 'Breakers', 'be', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'Alien', 'two', 'remaining', 'girls', 'decide', 'assassinate', 'Big', 'Arch', 'island', 'lair', 'Instead', 'trying', 'shoot', 'Big', 'Arch', 'where', 'accessible', ""'re"", 'asked', 'believe', 'Alien', 'speed', 'boat', 'rival', 'island', 'retreat', 'assisted', 'girls', 'go', 'up', 'Big', 'Arch', 'armed', 'posse', 'least', 'six', 'seven', 'bodyguards', 'Sure', 'enough', 'Alien', 'gunned', 'down', 'as', 'soon', 'boat', 'girls', 'slow', 'motion', 'shoot', 'bodyguards', 'then', 'gun', 'down', 'Big', 'Arch', 'inside', 'sauna', 'wonder', 'why', 'Big', 'Arch', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'gunfire', 'dispatched', '.So', 'two', 'bad', 'girls', 'go', 'merry', 'way', 'back', 'school', 'two', 'drug', 'dealers', 'meet', 'dismal', 'end', 'conceit', 'two', 'girls', 'would', 'so', 'easily', 'be', 'able', 'kill', 'dangerous', 'criminals', 'course', 'absurd', 'Only', 'slick', 'production', 'values', 'coupled', 'Franco', 'performance', 'film', 'notably', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'Franco', 'part', ""'Spring"", 'Breakers', 'worth', 'seeing', 'visual', 'experience', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'brain', 'massage']",N/A
