Bland,"[13, 62]","The Dennis Miller of old was a rarity - a performer that had no agenda and no stated political party, rather he was a good independant comic that would take pot-shots at both sides of the political spectrum when they deserved it.  After 9/11 he saw the liberal-bashing bandwagon take off and decided that it was a good way to lift his career out of the quagmire it had become.  The problem is that his new target audience is generally undereducated and incapable of understanding his love of obscure references... so his career stays stuck in the same place it was, touring casinos.  Within the next few years, expect him to take the next step down in career hell and start performing the county fair circuit.",1,Too bad he sold out,1151971200,"07 4, 2006",2006,709,"['Dennis', 'Miller', 'old', 'was', 'rarity', 'performer', 'had', 'agenda', 'stated', 'political', 'party', 'rather', 'was', 'good', 'independant', 'comic', 'would', 'take', 'pot-shots', 'sides', 'political', 'spectrum', 'when', 'deserved', '9/11', 'saw', 'liberal-bashing', 'bandwagon', 'take', 'off', 'decided', 'was', 'good', 'way', 'lift', 'career', 'quagmire', 'had', 'become', 'problem', 'new', 'target', 'audience', 'generally', 'undereducated', 'incapable', 'understanding', 'love', 'obscure', 'references', 'so', 'career', 'stuck', 'same', 'place', 'was', 'touring', 'casinos', 'next', 'few', 'years', 'expect', 'take', 'next', 'step', 'down', 'career', 'hell', 'start', 'performing', 'county', 'fair', 'circuit']",Dennis Miller - All In

He comes off as an insecure phony. Miller's new conservative mask is also unconvincing. Now he looks like a narcissistic sociopath. Not that his conservative homies would notice or care. His new material is bunk.

The real Dennis lives there.In 2001, the world changed, and so too did Dennis Miller. His show, a smart, funny, no holds barred review of the world without a political preference, was faced with being cancelled. Wagons were circled and politics became something that people no longer found humor in. Dennis had voted for Bush in 2000 and he found himself being claimed by the right wing.In a move of self preservation, he decided to emabrace this to keep his career alive in our troubled times. However, the intellect in his humor was not something the far right could grasp.This special has a lot of silence in it between jokes.At one point Dennis makes a positive comment about John Kerry and how we should honor and respect his Vietnam service when most of the Bush administration wanted to have nothing to do with that war. There were boos from the audience. Loud boos. Dennis tried to politely scold them for their narrow take on a pretty black and white comment, but the audience would have none of it.Poor Dennis. He has to insert generic Dems names into his jokes to pander to his highly partisan audience (Harry Reid is boring, Robert Byrd was in the clan... yawn.) Dennis is trapped. No longer is he able to be an equal opportunity comedian who pokes holes at the obvious flaws of both sides.It was sad to watch this. I love Dennis and think he deserves better. And I think he knows it too.If he is still around in a few years, just watch. He'll edge back towards where he once was. And perhaps again greatness.",2,Come back Dennis,1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,1629,"['was', 'painfully', 'sad', 'special', 'watch', 'Go', 'back', 'watch', 'old', 'comedy', 'specials', 'HBO', 'show', 'real', 'Dennis', 'there.In', '2001', 'world', 'changed', 'so', 'too', 'did', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'show', 'smart', 'funny', 'barred', 'review', 'world', 'political', 'preference', 'was', 'faced', 'being', 'cancelled', 'Wagons', 'were', 'circled', 'politics', 'became', 'something', 'people', 'no', 'longer', 'found', 'humor', 'Dennis', 'had', 'voted', 'Bush', '2000', 'found', 'being', 'claimed', 'right', 'wing.In', 'move', 'self', 'preservation', 'decided', 'emabrace', 'keep', 'career', 'alive', 'troubled', 'times', 'However', 'intellect', 'humor', 'was', 'not', 'something', 'far', 'right', 'could', 'grasp.This', 'special', 'lot', 'silence', 'jokes.At', 'one', 'point', 'Dennis', 'positive', 'comment', 'John', 'Kerry', 'how', 'should', 'honor', 'respect', 'Vietnam', 'service', 'when', 'most', 'Bush', 'administration', 'wanted', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'war', 'were', 'boos', 'audience', 'Loud', 'boos', 'Dennis', 'tried', 'politely', 'scold', 'narrow', 'take', 'pretty', 'black', 'white', 'comment', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'none', 'it.Poor', 'Dennis', 'insert', 'generic', 'Dems', 'names', 'jokes', 'pander', 'highly', 'partisan', 'audience', 'Harry', 'Reid', 'boring', 'Robert', 'Byrd', 'was', 'clan', 'yawn', 'Dennis', 'trapped', 'No', 'longer', 'able', 'be', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'comedian', 'who', 'holes', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'sides.It', 'was', 'sad', 'watch', 'love', 'Dennis', 'think', 'better', 'think', 'still', 'around', 'few', 'years', 'just', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'edge', 'back', 'towards', 'where', 'once', 'was', 'perhaps', 'again', 'greatness']",Dennis Miller - All In

But Dennis can and does make people think.

987897,AKL5YOD0FQJB0,B000FC2HR2,"Sharon Levenson ""reader""","[1, 13]","One of the basic staples of stand up comedy that includes political satire is that the comic must be non-partisan..A good comic puts aside his or her own personal agenda,knowing that both sides of the political fence deserve skewering..Dennis Miller used to be able to do this,and way back then the man was funny...Alas,somewhere along the way Miller has gone from being a comic to a right wing apologist,and while his now sadly one-sided brand of comedy might have some appeal for the extremist right wing,the broader audience finds the man not only un-funny but also pretentious,self-righteous,and dead wrong on many of the topics he chooses to ramble on about..Miller's 2006 ""special"" for HBO""All In"" appears to have been taped before the humiliating right wing debacle at the polls that november,where George Bush lost his majorities in both houses of congress,and his policies were roundly repudiated,a harbinger of things to come in 2008,which saw the congress become more firmly democratic,and a""liberal',Barack Obama,take the oval office..Miller's set starts out promisingly,with topics such as bad hair cuts,but quickly takes a nose-dive as Miller turns hard to the right,ridiculing as many democratic politicians as possible while giving one of the most lame reasons for supporting the Bush re-election over John Kerry as it has ever been my misfortune to hear.....Claiming that he has ""respect"" for Kerry's service during the viet nam conflict,and his record as a""war hero"" Miller none-the-less admits voting for Bush,because,according to Miller,Kerry's service in war is a disadvantage,his experience in a real,frontline,bullets flying combat situation would,according to Miller have made Kerry too cautious as president...No,what we do not want are cautious presidents whose own experience dictates deliberation..no sir!According to Miller what is needed is inexperience,and the bone-headedness to just react without thinking which,a smarmy smiling Miller assures us,is exactly what""these times"" require,and which the country has""wisely"" turned to in re-electing Bush..Watching Miller's thinly disguised anti-democratic,anti-""liberal"" pro-right wing,pro-war screed is painful now,all the more so given the additional catastrophes the nation has had to endure under Miller's choice as president..An economic melt-down,a sinking economy,lost jobs,lost homes,lost dreams and massive insecurity on a national scale unseen since the""great depression"" that began in 1929 ,plus a war that is STILL going on in Iraq,so many years after Miller's political choice,Bush prematurely pronounced the words""Mission Accomplished"" on a battle ship and with an american

Claiming that the people on the right are generally uneducated.  Hey, Kool-aid drinkers, stop thinking all of us are racist rednecks who, when they aren't farming, we're out marrying cousins.  And in case your wondering, Kool-aid drinkers is a reference to Jonestown.  Obscure enough for you?  Because I've got more.  They also think Dennis is throwing his hitching his wagon with the right wing.  Dennis is the same Dennis he's always been.  Take it from someone who watched his CNBC show almost everyday.  He doesn't support everything the right does.  But when it comes to the war on terrorism, he agrees.  And that's when he ""panders"" to the right, in some eyes.  Dennis always speaks his mind, and many times we don't like it.  That's what makes Dennis Miller, Dennis Miller.  He never sells out.  He's not Hollywood.  He's not on the left or right.  Take it from a guy who has been a fan since Weekend Update and been a fan throughout his career, good times and bad.  Leave Miller alone.  If you don't like some of his newer material, because it conflicts with your view of him, you are truly sad.  I'm sick of left wing ""intellectuals"" putting down others, all while claiming they are ""open-minded"".  Too often, those who claim to be that way, are often the most closed minded.
