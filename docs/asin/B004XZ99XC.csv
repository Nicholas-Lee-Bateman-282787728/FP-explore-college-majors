Another thing I like is that they do not have the usual Honeymooners stage backdrop. All of the shows have some real physical scenery, i.e, on the streets of NY.",5,These are really Lost Episodes,1370736000,"06 9, 2013",2013,419,"['was', 'bit', 'worried', 'had', 'read', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'really', 'did', 'have', 'lost', 'episodes', 'best', 'part', 'are', 'unusually', 'long', 'not', '20', 'mins', 'type', 'more', '35-45', 'minute', 'shows', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'punctuated', 'commercials', 'thing', 'like', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'usual', 'Honeymooners', 'stage', 'backdrop', 'shows', 'have', 'real', 'physical', 'scenery', 'i.e', 'streets', 'NY']",Best of Collection: Honeymooners Lost Episodes

Rayman ""Webkennection.com""","[0, 0]","The thing that really bugged me about this DVD is you have to sit through 20 minutes of commercials before you get to the Honeymooners episodes.  There is advertisement after advertisement for other DVDs and the main DVD menu is disabled until you watch all the advertising.When I buy a DVD and pay money for it, it should be totally free from any advertisement or it should clearly state on the box that the DVD contains mandatory advertising that you must watch in order to get to the main feature.Tried to return the DVD because of the advertising, but the local store said they were not allowed by laws passed by the movie industry to give a refund on any open movies.  They are allowed to exchange only.",2,"The Episodes are fine, but the DVD is plagued with advertising.",1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,708,"['thing', 'really', 'bugged', 'DVD', 'have', 'sit', '20', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'get', 'Honeymooners', 'episodes', 'advertisement', 'advertisement', 'other', 'DVDs', 'main', 'DVD', 'menu', 'disabled', 'watch', 'advertising.When', 'buy', 'DVD', 'pay', 'money', 'should', 'be', 'totally', 'free', 'advertisement', 'should', 'clearly', 'state', 'box', 'DVD', 'mandatory', 'advertising', 'must', 'watch', 'order', 'get', 'main', 'feature.Tried', 'return', 'DVD', 'advertising', 'local', 'store', 'said', 'were', 'not', 'allowed', 'laws', 'passed', 'movie', 'industry', 'give', 'refund', 'open', 'movies', 'are', 'allowed', 'exchange', 'only']",Best of Collection: Honeymooners Lost Episodes
