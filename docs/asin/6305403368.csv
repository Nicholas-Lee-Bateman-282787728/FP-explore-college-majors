I'm glad I recorded it too, because this was one of the most heart-felt Vietnam stories I've ever seen and read. Almost as stunning as &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; but not nearly as disturbing. The casting was perfect for every single role. I thought Kiefer Sutherland was the best of all of them. The girl, Georgina Cates, did a hauntingly spectacular job as Marianne.",5,Beautiful renditioning of a quite scary story,984009600,"03 8, 2001",2001,464,"['could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'actually', 'made', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Showtime', 'past', 'April', ""'m"", 'glad', 'recorded', 'too', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'heart-felt', 'Vietnam', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'read', 'as', 'stunning', 'quot', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'quot', 'not', 'nearly', 'disturbing', 'casting', 'was', 'perfect', 'single', 'role', 'thought', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'was', 'best', 'girl', 'Georgina', 'Cates', 'did', 'hauntingly', 'spectacular', 'job', 'Marianne']",Soldier's Sweetheart VHS

I was in Viet Nam and there is no way that this could have happened. Why is it Hollywood has to be so down on Viet Nam in general and Viet Nam vets in particular? I was very disappointed in this movie. 'Dear America' is more realistic about what we experienced. For an accurate 'war story', I would encourage people to see Mel Gibson's far better , as well as realistic, 'We Were Soldiers'.",1,Unrealsitic story of Viet Nam,1085097600,"05 21, 2004",2004,546,"['like', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'think', 'more', 'talent', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'always', 'movie', 'however', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'was', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'Why', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'so', 'down', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'general', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'vets', 'particular', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'America', 'more', 'realistic', 'what', 'experienced', 'accurate', ""'war"", 'story', 'would', 'encourage', 'people', 'see', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'far', 'better', 'as', 'well', 'realistic', 'Were', 'Soldiers']",Soldier's Sweetheart VHS

Gilbert,"[4, 4]","The movie might seem on the surface to be silly and unrealistic and if you did not read the original work, The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien, it is quite possible to dismiss this as nonsensical fluff from an anti-Vietnam soldier perspective. Tim O'Brien was in Vietnam. The whole book needs to be read to understand the story (""The Sweetheart of Song Tra Bong"") and that might be the problem in trying to present only part of the novel in a TV movie.O' Brien (the narrator in the book) tells the readers later in the novel that the story is probably the most realistic of all those in the book. Maybe ""Mary Anne"" or the girl next door didn't really show up in Nam, but innocent, impressionable kids did go to Nam and did develop a killer's eye and instincts.The story is a metaphor for those young men who went to Vietnam with no real understanding of the war or the mechanics of fighting and were turned into killing machines as a means to survive the madness there. Some literally became machines, but of course, not all did. The majority of soldiers put in their time and tried to find a sense of normalcy, but O'Brien's story points out that even the purest of people could be damned by the war.",3,Vietnam truth,1254441600,"10 2, 2009",2009,1204,"['movie', 'might', 'seem', 'surface', 'be', 'silly', 'unrealistic', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'original', 'work', 'Things', 'Carried', 'Tim', ""O'Brien"", 'quite', 'possible', 'dismiss', 'nonsensical', 'fluff', 'anti-Vietnam', 'soldier', 'perspective', 'Tim', ""O'Brien"", 'was', 'Vietnam', 'whole', 'book', 'needs', 'be', 'read', 'understand', 'story', 'Sweetheart', 'Song', 'Tra', 'Bong', 'might', 'be', 'problem', 'trying', 'present', 'only', 'part', 'novel', 'TV', 'movie.O', 'Brien', 'narrator', 'book', 'readers', 'later', 'novel', 'story', 'probably', 'most', 'realistic', 'book', 'Maybe', 'Mary', 'Anne', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'show', 'up', 'Nam', 'innocent', 'impressionable', 'kids', 'did', 'go', 'Nam', 'did', 'develop', 'killer', 'eye', 'instincts.The', 'story', 'metaphor', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'went', 'Vietnam', 'real', 'understanding', 'war', 'mechanics', 'fighting', 'were', 'turned', 'killing', 'machines', 'means', 'survive', 'madness', 'there', 'literally', 'became', 'machines', 'course', 'not', 'did', 'majority', 'soldiers', 'put', 'time', 'tried', 'find', 'sense', 'normalcy', ""O'Brien"", 'story', 'points', 'out', 'even', 'purest', 'people', 'could', 'be', 'damned', 'war']",Soldier's Sweetheart VHS
