Sellers and Cleese are fabulous- the Sellers episode alone is worth getting the disk- but the Moore episode is just kind of flat, and his numbers aren't very interesting.I have not had the disk problems that other reviewers seem to have. The audio on my disks is fine, and they play fine.It is a shame that there isn't more ""bonus material"" on these disks, considering the price; they could be great ads for modern Muppet projects.",4,Another 2 our of 3 Disk,1092787200,"08 18, 2004",2004,543,"['most', 'Muppets', 'disks', 'are', '2', '3', 'affairs-', '2', 'good', 'great', 'episodes', 'one', 'mediocre', 'one', 'Sellers', 'Cleese', 'are', 'fabulous-', 'Sellers', 'episode', 'alone', 'worth', 'getting', 'disk-', 'Moore', 'episode', 'just', 'kind', 'flat', 'numbers', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting.I', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'disk', 'problems', 'other', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'have', 'audio', 'disks', 'fine', 'play', 'fine.It', 'shame', ""n't"", 'more', 'bonus', 'material', 'disks', 'considering', 'price', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'ads', 'modern', 'Muppet', 'projects']",N/A

However, it's amazing sometimes when you grow up and then look back at some of the things that you really enjoyed when you were a kid and then realise that they weren't quite as great as you thought.This collection of episodes with the exception of what is by far the best one here, Dudley Moore's episode, doesn't age well at all. There is no denying the comedic genius of both Sellers and Cleese, however, either the material they had to work with was extremely poor or they were just unmotivated and it seemed to me, especially where Sellers and Cleese are concerned that they were totally uninterested and were only willing to put in the minimum of effort to fulfil a gig that their agent set for them.  The jokes for those two episodes while they may have made me laugh as a child are now so poor that I actually found myself squirming in my seat just hoping that they would put me out of my agony by ending post haste.Dudley Moore's time at bat was a notable exception as he genuinely was funny and most of his jokes and skits actually age well and perhaps just for his work, this DVD may just well be worth the purchase price.  He actually looked like he gave a damn and was applying himself.  Could it be that he was a relatively new actor at the time as compared to Sellers and Cleese and so wanted to impress?  In any case, he showed he had a special talent for vaudevillian shows which is what the Muppet Show really is and I thoroughly enjoyed his episode.  I actually hated him in ""Arthur"" but strangely enough my perception of him and his talents changed after viewing this episode.  Great comedian and great musician too.The picture quality is so poor that it's barely above VHS quality and the sound quality is not remastered well enough coming without any Surround Sound option, DTS with THX or Dolby 5.1 although whose of you with Pro Logic would have it a little better.  Really for a 25th anniversary edition, you'd think they would give this project a little more respect and restore both the visual and sound quality for posterity like Disney did for their other projects such as ""Fantasia"" and ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" but they didn't even bother here.  There are no special features of note here at all except for trailers of other movies where ironically the sound and picture quality for these are far, far better than for the main episodes.Still for fans of the show who want a little token to remind them of the good old days without having to buy the complete episodes, this may just be it except that there may just be other editions with better episodes than this one where only the Dudley Moore episode is worthy of the tag ""best of"" here.  Ironically, you can't judge the quality of the episodes based solely on the reputation of the guests at that time.Not recommended.",2,Brings Back Great Memories But Too Bad About the DVD!,1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,3038,"['When', 'was', 'child', 'remember', 'very', 'few', 'things', 'filled', 'up', 'such', 'excitement', 'anticipation', 'when', 'was', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'latest', 'episode', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'screen', 'tv', 'hard', 'day', 'slog', 'school', 'However', 'amazing', 'sometimes', 'when', 'grow', 'up', 'then', 'look', 'back', 'things', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'when', 'were', 'kid', 'then', 'realise', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'great', 'thought.This', 'collection', 'episodes', 'exception', 'what', 'far', 'best', 'one', 'here', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'episode', ""n't"", 'age', 'well', 'denying', 'comedic', 'genius', 'Sellers', 'Cleese', 'however', 'material', 'had', 'work', 'was', 'extremely', 'poor', 'were', 'just', 'unmotivated', 'seemed', 'especially', 'where', 'Sellers', 'Cleese', 'are', 'concerned', 'were', 'totally', 'uninterested', 'were', 'only', 'willing', 'put', 'minimum', 'effort', 'fulfil', 'gig', 'agent', 'set', 'jokes', 'two', 'episodes', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'child', 'are', 'now', 'so', 'poor', 'actually', 'found', 'squirming', 'seat', 'just', 'hoping', 'would', 'put', 'agony', 'ending', 'post', 'haste.Dudley', 'Moore', 'time', 'bat', 'was', 'notable', 'exception', 'genuinely', 'was', 'funny', 'most', 'jokes', 'skits', 'actually', 'age', 'well', 'perhaps', 'just', 'work', 'DVD', 'may', 'just', 'well', 'be', 'purchase', 'price', 'actually', 'looked', 'gave', 'damn', 'was', 'applying', 'Could', 'be', 'was', 'relatively', 'new', 'actor', 'time', 'compared', 'Sellers', 'Cleese', 'so', 'wanted', 'impress', 'case', 'showed', 'had', 'special', 'talent', 'vaudevillian', 'shows', 'what', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'really', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'episode', 'actually', 'hated', 'Arthur', 'strangely', 'enough', 'perception', 'talents', 'changed', 'viewing', 'episode', 'Great', 'comedian', 'great', 'musician', 'too.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'so', 'poor', 'barely', 'VHS', 'quality', 'sound', 'quality', 'not', 'remastered', 'well', 'enough', 'coming', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'option', 'DTS', 'THX', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'Pro', 'Logic', 'would', 'have', 'little', 'better', 'Really', '25th', 'anniversary', 'edition', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'give', 'project', 'little', 'more', 'respect', 'restore', 'visual', 'sound', 'quality', 'posterity', 'Disney', 'did', 'other', 'projects', 'such', 'Fantasia', 'Snow', 'White', 'Seven', 'Dwarfs', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'here', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'note', 'here', 'trailers', 'other', 'movies', 'where', 'ironically', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'main', 'episodes.Still', 'fans', 'show', 'who', 'want', 'little', 'token', 'remind', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'having', 'buy', 'complete', 'episodes', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'other', 'editions', 'better', 'episodes', 'one', 'where', 'only', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'episode', 'worthy', 'tag', 'best', 'here', 'Ironically', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'quality', 'episodes', 'based', 'solely', 'reputation', 'guests', 'time.Not', 'recommended']",N/A

This DVD contains three great episodes with three big name stars - Peter Sellers (Season 2, episode 19, first aired on 12/6/77), John Cleese (2.23, aired 8/10/1977), and Dudley Moore (4.7, aired 6/12/1979).

733877,A3TNAC1EWMG39T,B0000844MM,"Matthew Weaver ""cesarfaison""","[25, 25]","It's astonishing to see Peter Sellers, arguably one of the best actors of all time, working so gamely with the Muppets. Like the chameleon that he is, Sellers throws himself into each sketch that he performs, be it as Boris the beleaguered gypsy musician, a Strangelove-esque masseuse who leaves Link Hogthrob tied up in knots, or even as himself, whispering quietly to Kermit that he has had the real himself surgically removed, then playing a pair of tuned chickens under his armpits while reciting the ""winter of discontent"" speech from Richard III. Positively fascinating.Cleese, too, is a scream, especially as a sea pirate who has lost his way on ""Pigs In Space.""Moore's show is apparently trying to send a message that was crucial at the time, but those not in on the joke are not going to get it as well. It's fun to watch Dudley at odds with Animal, though.And in ""Muppet Extras,"" be sure to click on ""Movie Mania,"" for a [take-off] of ""The Godfather"" that is a sight to behold.",5,Peter Sellers Right At Home With the Muppets.,1047772800,"03 16, 2003",2003,987,"['astonishing', 'see', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'arguably', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'time', 'working', 'so', 'gamely', 'Muppets', 'chameleon', 'Sellers', 'sketch', 'be', 'Boris', 'beleaguered', 'gypsy', 'musician', 'Strangelove-esque', 'masseuse', 'who', 'Link', 'Hogthrob', 'tied', 'up', 'knots', 'even', 'whispering', 'quietly', 'Kermit', 'had', 'real', 'surgically', 'removed', 'then', 'playing', 'pair', 'tuned', 'chickens', 'armpits', 'reciting', 'winter', 'discontent', 'speech', 'Richard', 'III', 'Positively', 'fascinating.Cleese', 'too', 'scream', 'especially', 'sea', 'pirate', 'who', 'lost', 'way', 'Pigs', 'Space', 'Moore', 'show', 'apparently', 'trying', 'send', 'message', 'was', 'crucial', 'time', 'not', 'joke', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'as', 'well', 'fun', 'watch', 'Dudley', 'odds', 'Animal', 'though.And', 'Muppet', 'Extras', 'be', 'sure', 'click', 'Movie', 'Mania', '[', 'take-off', ']', 'Godfather', 'sight', 'behold']",N/A

There's always an episode that you semi liked or just didn't like and the rest were wonderful.This DVD was all wonderful. The three actors were funny, even Dudley Moore and I'm not too fond of him. Peter Sellers was the best, he is an outstanding comedian who fits in so well with the spirit and humor of the muppets. From being a gypsy to a singing preacher it was great.John Cleese is always funny, his skit in Pigs in Space as a pirate from the 1600's with a jealous parrot always nagging him as he tries to take over the Swinetrek is a hoot.Dudley Moore's was the least outrageous but it had it's moments.
