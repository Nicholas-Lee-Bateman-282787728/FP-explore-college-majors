The rapture has just taken place and we get to follow those left behind as the world unites under a charismatic new leader (Antichrist). The bad guys still want the microchip that's implanted in Craig Sheffer's arm. ""The Mark: Redemption"" is less preachy compared to some other films in this genre and can be enjoyed by non-Christian fans of apocalyptic action movies if they can overlook the occasional religious references.
