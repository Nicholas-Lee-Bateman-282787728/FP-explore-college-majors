After the war Newfoundland became a province of Canada. But it was an independent dominion during the greatest conflict humanity has known. And it had strategic importance because it was about the closest part of North America to Europe. It was the jumping-off point for aircraft flying to the British Isles. Some of the first aircraft to fly to the battle theater instead of going by ship were Lockheed Hudsons. These were militarized Electra, 14-seat passenger planes. They were about as bad a warplane as you would expect from a non-purpose-built plane. But they could out-fly a submarine so they were vital to RAF Coastal Command in the Battle of the Atlantic. This film shows how they were hurried across in the winter season against all odds of success and how a number of individuals' lives were effected.

This Canadian made-for-TV mini-series uses this dire situation as a backdrop.Since submarine warfare is slowly strangling Britain's ability to defend herself something has to be done to get materials across the Atlantic.  A bold military officer and his capable female assistant take on the responsibility of setting up a risky yet vital plan to fly planes across the north Altantic from Newfoundland to Britain.When the officer and his assistant arrive at a small Newfoundland airfield, they face the challenges of recruiting and retaining pilots, and training them to fly across the north Altantic (a risky venture at best), and dealing with the local townsfolk.We soon learn that the assistant has a history with the local airfield operator, and their past catches up to them as men and machines face perilous odds as they prepare to fly.I found this show to depict an interesting and generally overlooked aspect of early WWII.  It therefore deserves recognition.  At the same time I found the acting and overall quality of the production to be only good, not great.History buffs should enjoy this show, but the average viewer would probably find it to be rather tedious, since it is generally lacking in high-cost digital candy that flavors most movies these days.I'd rate this 4-stars for the history buff/romance crowd, and perhaps 2- stars for the general audience.

This movie details, with great charm, the perilous mission of flying new American made planes from Newfoundland to Ireland - a risky move that shortened the delivery time from 10 days to 10 hours. The venture was responsible for turning the tide of the war. The acting is first class and includes stellar performances by Kenneth Walsh, Richard E. Grant and the inimitable Joss Ackland as Churchill. Sluggish at times and with poor digital animation of the planes (they only found one Hudson plane so had to computer generate the rest). Aviation buffs may notice some errors, but it doesn't detract from the overall quality of the film. It will take two nights to watch, so be prepared with lots of popcorn. Truly one of the more interesting films I have ever watched and I would highly recommend it to anyone. Definitely a must for getting teens hooked on history - includes a love story for the girls and lots of macho danger and adventure for the boys.",5,Absolutely Fascinating- Must See!,1181001600,"06 5, 2007",2007,1084,"['What', 'wonderful', 'delight', 'am', 'avid', 'history', 'buff', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'find', 'huge', 'story', 'WW2', 'knew', 'nothing', 'about', 'movie', 'details', 'great', 'charm', 'perilous', 'mission', 'flying', 'new', 'American', 'made', 'planes', 'Newfoundland', 'Ireland', 'risky', 'move', 'shortened', 'delivery', 'time', '10', 'days', '10', 'hours', 'venture', 'was', 'responsible', 'turning', 'tide', 'war', 'acting', 'first', 'class', 'stellar', 'performances', 'Kenneth', 'Walsh', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'inimitable', 'Joss', 'Ackland', 'Churchill', 'Sluggish', 'times', 'poor', 'digital', 'animation', 'planes', 'only', 'found', 'one', 'Hudson', 'plane', 'so', 'had', 'computer', 'generate', 'rest', 'Aviation', 'buffs', 'may', 'notice', 'errors', ""n't"", 'detract', 'overall', 'quality', 'film', 'will', 'take', 'two', 'nights', 'watch', 'so', 'be', 'prepared', 'lots', 'popcorn', 'Truly', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'Definitely', 'must', 'getting', 'teens', 'hooked', 'history', 'love', 'story', 'girls', 'lots', 'macho', 'danger', 'adventure', 'boys']",N/A

Britain needed planes and the German submarines were making crossing the Atlantic by ship very difficult.  Many believed the task of flying the Bombers over the Atlantic was too difficult to work...especially since the pilots were to be Women.  A very interesting and true story with only one problem.  It is overly long since it was obviously slated to play on two nights on TV.  Still worth the watching.,3,"Ferrying Bombers from the U.

Though, this film isn't the caliber of our favorite.  It is a great movie of an unknown service during World War II.  It gave some history of the opening trials that Great Britian was experiencing.  History has it that the United States came to the aid of the British through supplies and naval ships.  This film enlightened me of the tasks involved in getting airpower to the Allied forces.  It is a real tribute of the flyers and early aircraft involved.  I would have liked to have seen the women flyers given a fair shake in this film.  But, this was a superb film in its own right.
