1002422,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B000GEIRF0,barry,"[4, 5]","There are so many crime shows out there today but CRIMINAL MINDS is very unique.  I must start by saying I started by watching this show during its third season on televison and it became my favorite show so I have purchased all the seasons and am starting at the beginning.  There is much interest and intrigue in society of serial killers not only for the acts they perform but moreso into what the minds of these people are really like.  This series creatively, artistically and intelligently provides much education and entertainment in this genre.  This is not a mere crime show but is dedicated to studying the minds of those in our society who commit evil.At the center is the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU).  The team can only become involved in a a crime when the city involved extends an invitation for their added expertise.  One thing that is very unique about this show is that all the team members are gifted yet have their own specialties as well.  When approaching any case the discussion is often a free for all with each member giving their perspective.  They play off each other and by no member, even the boss Gideon, acting superior each member is treated with respect.  These characters are also projected as very human.  The crimes and acts they see are often troubling to deal with  and we see how it affects them.  Through their interactions and communication over a case the viewer is educated into how profiling a criminal actually works.  We learn how patterns are actually established with a killer.  The show can get very graphic but is in no way gratuitous.  The violence has a definite realistivc purpose.Going back to episode 1 has bee a treat for though there is a major story each episode the lives of the BAU members are evolving stories and even some of the plots have deeper resonance and appear again.  I think this season is excellent but also must say that it only improves with each upcoming season. The team members were superbly cast.  Dr. Spencer Reid is quite a character.  He is 24 and an actual genius.  He brings much needed facts and knowledge to the cases but he stumbles as he tries to gain experience with actual life and social skills.  Derek Morgan and J.J. Jareau are excellently fit.  Next to Matthew Gray Gubler who plays Dr. Reid the standouts are Thomas Gibson as Aaron Hotchner and Mandy Patinkin as Jason Gideon.  They both head the unbit.  Hotchner comes across as a professional who follows all rules and politics.  Gideon is a seasoned veteran.  The only slightly off casting is Lola Glaudini as Elle Greenway but this gets taken care of later.I cannot stress how unique and fresh this show is.  Each agent has a personal reason for having such a job as tracking serial killers and all of this makes it even more realistic.  Watch each episode and note how they are not formula.  Note how creatively the audience is educated thru the writing of the show.  And if this show appeals to you just rest assured that with each season the characters develop more and more and the plots/story lines just get better and better.  Yes, there will be cast changes but they are written into the show perfectly.  This show is dedicated to entering criminals minds and expertly does with each episode.  It is certainly addictive and a must see.",5,First season of a superb intelligent series,1256688000,"10 28, 2009",2009,3300,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'crime', 'out', 'there', 'today', 'CRIMINAL', 'MINDS', 'very', 'unique', 'must', 'start', 'saying', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'third', 'season', 'televison', 'became', 'favorite', 'show', 'so', 'have', 'purchased', 'seasons', 'am', 'starting', 'beginning', 'much', 'interest', 'intrigue', 'society', 'serial', 'killers', 'not', 'only', 'acts', 'perform', 'moreso', 'what', 'minds', 'people', 'are', 'really', 'like', 'series', 'creatively', 'artistically', 'intelligently', 'much', 'education', 'entertainment', 'genre', 'not', 'mere', 'crime', 'show', 'dedicated', 'studying', 'minds', 'society', 'who', 'commit', 'center', 'FBI', 'Behavioral', 'Analysis', 'Unit', 'BAU', 'team', 'can', 'only', 'become', 'involved', 'crime', 'when', 'city', 'involved', 'invitation', 'added', 'expertise', 'One', 'thing', 'very', 'unique', 'show', 'team', 'members', 'are', 'gifted', 'yet', 'have', 'own', 'specialties', 'well', 'When', 'approaching', 'case', 'discussion', 'often', 'free', 'member', 'giving', 'perspective', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'member', 'even', 'boss', 'Gideon', 'acting', 'superior', 'member', 'treated', 'respect', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'projected', 'very', 'human', 'crimes', 'see', 'are', 'often', 'troubling', 'deal', 'see', 'how', 'interactions', 'communication', 'case', 'viewer', 'educated', 'how', 'profiling', 'criminal', 'actually', 'learn', 'how', 'patterns', 'are', 'actually', 'established', 'killer', 'show', 'can', 'get', 'very', 'graphic', 'way', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'definite', 'realistivc', 'purpose.Going', 'back', 'episode', '1', 'bee', 'treat', 'major', 'story', 'episode', 'lives', 'BAU', 'members', 'are', 'evolving', 'stories', 'even', 'plots', 'have', 'deeper', 'resonance', 'appear', 'again', 'think', 'season', 'excellent', 'also', 'must', 'say', 'only', 'upcoming', 'season', 'team', 'members', 'were', 'superbly', 'cast', 'Dr.', 'Spencer', 'Reid', 'quite', 'character', '24', 'actual', 'genius', 'much', 'needed', 'facts', 'knowledge', 'cases', 'gain', 'experience', 'actual', 'life', 'social', 'skills', 'Derek', 'Morgan', 'J.J.', 'Jareau', 'are', 'excellently', 'fit', 'Next', 'Matthew', 'Gray', 'Gubler', 'who', 'Dr.', 'Reid', 'standouts', 'are', 'Thomas', 'Gibson', 'Aaron', 'Hotchner', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'Jason', 'Gideon', 'head', 'unbit', 'Hotchner', 'across', 'professional', 'who', 'rules', 'politics', 'Gideon', 'seasoned', 'veteran', 'only', 'slightly', 'casting', 'Lola', 'Glaudini', 'Elle', 'Greenway', 'taken', 'care', 'later.I', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'how', 'unique', 'fresh', 'show', 'agent', 'personal', 'reason', 'having', 'job', 'tracking', 'serial', 'killers', 'even', 'more', 'realistic', 'Watch', 'episode', 'note', 'how', 'are', 'not', 'formula', 'Note', 'how', 'creatively', 'audience', 'educated', 'writing', 'show', 'show', 'appeals', 'just', 'rest', 'assured', 'season', 'characters', 'develop', 'more', 'more', 'plots/story', 'lines', 'just', 'get', 'better', 'better', 'Yes', 'will', 'be', 'cast', 'changes', 'are', 'written', 'show', 'perfectly', 'show', 'dedicated', 'entering', 'criminals', 'minds', 'expertly', 'episode', 'certainly', 'addictive', 'must', 'see']",N/A

1002426,A2LUBAFR9H2UX7,B000GEIRF0,Caballero del febo,"[30, 56]","This is network TV, closer to ""Mission Impossible"" and ""Charlie's Angels"" than, say, ""Hill Street Blues"", or more to the point, ""The Shield"" or ""The Sopranos"".  Why?  It adopts the traditional format of one mystery to solve per episode; subtracting precious minutes for commercials, that leaves 40-45 minutes to open with a killing, move on to the investigation and resolution, and squeeze in a little epilogue.  The characters have little space to breathe, and virtually none to evolve from one episode to the next.  That's not to say the actors are bad, far from it.  The team's moral leader, professorial/fatherly Jason Gideon projects humanity, concern and commitment.  The others make credible personas out of only the flimsiest material:  Hotch (my favorite) is so repressed it's almost painful to watch, and Elle is both fun to watch and a believable being.But there are serious structural problems.  One is that ""Dr."" Reid, the resident genius, is kind of a fifth wheel since basically everyone on the team seems to know everything.  Weakness two is the ""tossing the ball around"" scenes (that's what they're called in the audio commentaries), where plot exposition is dealt out in equal shares to the whole team -- Gideon will ask, as if leading a graduate seminar, ""So what do we know about (icepick murderers)?"", and team member A will pipe up, ""Well, there are four main types, the first is the (repressed avenger), who ...""; member B continues, ""The second type is the ..."", etc.  These people spend an inordinate amount of time telling each other things they seem to already know.  Press conferences work the same way -- Hotch (standing stiffly before the flipchart):  ""Our killer is a white male with a broken arm""; Derek (one buttock on a cop's desk):  ""He collects bottle caps or lives with his mother""; Elle (near the window): ""He probably flunked out of 8th grade, maybe 9th"" ... but never interrupting each other, never stepping on anyone's toes, just fluidly segueing from one voice to the next like interchangeable extensions of a hive mind.  In some episodes, everything clicks, or the writers made an extra effort to complexify the basic premise, and you buy it:  ""Won't get fooled again"", ""Poison"" and ""Ride the lightning"" are episodes that really worked for me.  Others are unconvincing, going-through-the-motions deals where you mostly feel guilty for watching such sordid stuff in the name of entertainment.  ""The Fisher King, Part 1"" comes to mind.  Note the part 1, and the fact that it closes the season ('nuff said).Series signatures are: 1- They call suspects ""Un-subs"" (it sounds cool, and they say it's authentic); 2- While the team flies to and from the crime scene in their private jet, voice-overs deliver quotes (""G.K. Chesterton wrote ..."") which are supposed to have relevance to the episode in hand (kind of a ""thought for the day""); 3- As a team member builds up the profile for his listener (say in a press conference), the background will occasionally melt into a special effect reconstruction of the hypothetical killer in his environment, and the speaker will enter this imaginary space to conjure it up more fully (interesting; a bit gimmicky, though - I'm not sure it really adds anything useful).",3,Just TV,1178236800,"05 4, 2007",2007,3245,"['network', 'TV', 'closer', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'say', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'more', 'point', 'Shield', 'Sopranos', 'Why', 'traditional', 'format', 'one', 'mystery', 'solve', 'episode', 'subtracting', 'precious', 'minutes', 'commercials', '40-45', 'minutes', 'open', 'killing', 'move', 'investigation', 'resolution', 'squeeze', 'little', 'epilogue', 'characters', 'have', 'little', 'space', 'breathe', 'virtually', 'none', 'evolve', 'one', 'episode', 'next', 'not', 'say', 'actors', 'are', 'bad', 'far', 'team', 'moral', 'leader', 'professorial/fatherly', 'Jason', 'Gideon', 'projects', 'humanity', 'concern', 'commitment', 'others', 'make', 'credible', 'personas', 'only', 'flimsiest', 'material', 'Hotch', 'favorite', 'so', 'repressed', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'Elle', 'fun', 'watch', 'believable', 'being.But', 'are', 'serious', 'structural', 'problems', 'One', 'Dr.', 'Reid', 'resident', 'genius', 'kind', 'fifth', 'wheel', 'basically', 'everyone', 'team', 'know', 'everything', 'Weakness', 'two', 'tossing', 'ball', 'scenes', 'what', ""'re"", 'called', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'where', 'plot', 'exposition', 'dealt', 'out', 'equal', 'shares', 'whole', 'team', 'Gideon', 'will', 'ask', 'leading', 'graduate', 'seminar', 'So', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'icepick', 'murderers', 'team', 'member', 'A', 'will', 'pipe', 'up', 'Well', 'are', 'four', 'main', 'types', 'first', 'repressed', 'avenger', 'who', 'member', 'B', 'second', 'type', 'etc', 'people', 'spend', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'time', 'telling', 'other', 'things', 'seem', 'already', 'know', 'Press', 'conferences', 'work', 'same', 'way', 'Hotch', 'standing', 'stiffly', 'flipchart', 'killer', 'white', 'male', 'broken', 'arm', 'Derek', 'one', 'buttock', 'cop', 'desk', 'bottle', 'caps', 'lives', 'mother', 'Elle', 'window', 'probably', 'flunked', '8th', 'grade', 'maybe', '9th', 'never', 'interrupting', 'other', 'never', 'stepping', 'anyone', 'toes', 'just', 'fluidly', 'segueing', 'one', 'voice', 'next', 'interchangeable', 'extensions', 'hive', 'mind', 'episodes', 'everything', 'clicks', 'writers', 'made', 'extra', 'effort', 'complexify', 'basic', 'premise', 'buy', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'fooled', 'again', 'Poison', 'Ride', 'lightning', 'are', 'really', 'worked', 'Others', 'are', 'unconvincing', 'going-through-the-motions', 'deals', 'where', 'mostly', 'feel', 'guilty', 'watching', 'such', 'sordid', 'stuff', 'name', 'entertainment', 'Fisher', 'King', 'Part', '1', 'mind', 'Note', 'part', '1', 'fact', 'season', ""'nuff"", 'said', '.Series', 'signatures', 'are', '1-', 'call', 'Un-subs', 'cool', 'say', 'authentic', '2-', 'team', 'crime', 'scene', 'private', 'jet', 'voice-overs', 'deliver', 'G.K.', 'Chesterton', 'wrote', 'are', 'supposed', 'have', 'relevance', 'episode', 'hand', 'kind', 'thought', 'day', '3-', 'team', 'member', 'up', 'profile', 'listener', 'say', 'press', 'conference', 'background', 'will', 'occasionally', 'melt', 'special', 'effect', 'reconstruction', 'hypothetical', 'killer', 'environment', 'speaker', 'will', 'enter', 'imaginary', 'space', 'conjure', 'up', 'more', 'fully', 'interesting', 'bit', 'gimmicky', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'really', 'anything', 'useful']",N/A

1002431,A3H6HGQFL1GBO2,B000GEIRF0,"Claude Greenmount ""semper ubi sub ubi!""","[2, 5]","""Criminal Minds"" is among the more recent entries in the TV crime-thriller field, and is also evidence that TV, while on the one hand has continued to be a medium for vapid, mindless programming has also become much, much smarter.  If you don't believe me, compare the ""cops-n-robbers"" shows of the 70s (Charley's Angles, Starskey and Hutch, et alia) with the various CSI franchises and Criminal Minds.  Often, these more recent television series will have at least two, if not 3 or more intersecting plot lines the viewer must keep track of, and all are resolved using the experience and intelligence of the crime-solving characters.  The ""Detective"" shows of an earlier era tended to feature the crime solvers cavorting aimlessly in a variety of sexy stituations until they somehow stumbled onto the criminal when the TV hour was up.Criminal Minds is indeed a very smart show, and the actors generally do a fine job.  Mandy Patinkin is convincing and likeable as the head of his team.  For some reason, though, they seem desperately to want us to like Matthew Grey Gubler's character, Dr. Reid (PhD); he is actually rather unlikeable, with his insistence on being called ""Dr"" at all times (something only done outside of academic situations for holders of the MD, not the PhD) and his frequent announcements of his IQ and reading speeds.  This guy hasn't had a date because he's a geek and insecure, but because he's rather unbearable even in small doses.  Kirsten Vangsness is a much more interesting 'brainiac' but she seems to have a supporting role (having only seen the first season, I realize this may well have changed).

Middleton,"[2, 3]","When you believe that ""cop shows"", that is, for example, Law and Order, CSI and all their spin off's, including the literarily hundreds in the history of television, that it would be highly improbable for the professionals to come up with another one, Criminal Minds hits the screen in 2005 and becomes an instant hit. This is an excellent television show; however, considering the above, what has made this series such a success?When viewing the entire first season, Criminal Minds reminded me, somewhat vaguely, of the 90's hit series, Millennium. The show has a certain creepy atmosphere due to the subject matter.An elite group with their own special skills investigate, analyse and attempt to solve extremely diabolical crimes, perpetrated by, in most cases, intelligent psychopaths, serial killers, who ""joy kill"" or have their own insane agendas. What makes this show different is that ""science"" is not used to solve the crimes, but the killers are profiled, they are psychoanalysed, and from the teams' deductions, certain clues are pursued leading to an arrest or in some cases, the death of the killer.Another writer has called this series ""Holmesian"" in the tradition of the famous 19th century fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes, using the art of deduction to solve the crimes. This is a fair comparison though Holmes used ""science"" as well to solve his cases including old fashion deduction.Another aspect that has made the series a success is the array of interesting characters. ""Hotch"" played by Thomas Gibson, is your straight, serious FBI agent, the type that you would imagine sleeping in his suit. Hotch is a good balance for the non-traditional agent, Jason Gibson, played by Mandy Patinkin. Patinkin is a seasoned actor that drives the show forward. Then of course there's Dr. Spencer Reid adeptly portrayed by Mathew Gray Gubler. He's a 24 year old genius, a walking, talking library of information from Quantum theory to 12th century poetry.Most of not all the episodes in season one are well written and the production value is the best you'll see on television.Criminal Minds has to be one of the finest ""cop shows"" to come out in years.",4,Finest Cop Show to come out in Years,1191283200,"10 2, 2007",2007,2165,"['When', 'believe', 'cop', 'shows', 'example', 'Law', 'Order', 'CSI', 'spin', 'including', 'literarily', 'hundreds', 'history', 'television', 'would', 'be', 'highly', 'improbable', 'professionals', 'come', 'up', 'one', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'screen', '2005', 'instant', 'hit', 'excellent', 'television', 'show', 'however', 'considering', 'above', 'what', 'made', 'series', 'success', 'When', 'viewing', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'reminded', 'somewhat', 'vaguely', '90', 'hit', 'series', 'Millennium', 'show', 'certain', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'due', 'subject', 'matter.An', 'elite', 'group', 'own', 'special', 'skills', 'investigate', 'analyse', 'attempt', 'solve', 'extremely', 'diabolical', 'crimes', 'perpetrated', 'most', 'cases', 'intelligent', 'psychopaths', 'serial', 'killers', 'who', 'joy', 'kill', 'have', 'own', 'insane', 'agendas', 'What', 'show', 'different', 'science', 'not', 'used', 'solve', 'crimes', 'killers', 'are', 'profiled', 'are', 'psychoanalysed', 'teams', 'deductions', 'certain', 'clues', 'are', 'pursued', 'leading', 'arrest', 'cases', 'death', 'killer.Another', 'writer', 'called', 'series', 'Holmesian', 'tradition', 'famous', '19th', 'century', 'fictional', 'detective', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'using', 'art', 'deduction', 'solve', 'crimes', 'fair', 'comparison', 'Holmes', 'used', 'science', 'as', 'well', 'solve', 'cases', 'including', 'old', 'fashion', 'deduction.Another', 'aspect', 'made', 'series', 'success', 'array', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Hotch', 'played', 'Thomas', 'Gibson', 'straight', 'serious', 'FBI', 'agent', 'type', 'would', 'imagine', 'sleeping', 'suit', 'Hotch', 'good', 'balance', 'non-traditional', 'agent', 'Jason', 'Gibson', 'played', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'Patinkin', 'seasoned', 'actor', 'show', 'forward', 'Then', 'course', 'Dr.', 'Spencer', 'Reid', 'adeptly', 'portrayed', 'Mathew', 'Gray', 'Gubler', '24', 'year', 'old', 'genius', 'walking', 'talking', 'library', 'information', 'Quantum', 'theory', '12th', 'century', 'poetry.Most', 'not', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'production', 'value', 'best', ""'ll"", 'see', 'television.Criminal', 'Minds', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'cop', 'shows', 'come', 'out', 'years']",N/A

1002450,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,B000GEIRF0,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[3, 5]","I watched this show from the beginning and I'am still loving as it progress through Season 2. ""Criminal Minds"" is a big hit and while not everyone jumped on the bandwagon when it premiered, it's clear now that it's gotten a big audience.Yep, this is similar to other shows ""Profiler"", ""NYPD Blue"", "" Hillstreet Blues"", but it was an OK pilot. Was I impressed? Both yes and No. They spun a bit of originality in this one by having the character of Gideon be sort of poetic cop who likes to recite lines from Emerson, Nietzsche "" If you look too deeply into the abyss, the abyss will look into you."" Gideon is definitely out there.That was my initial impression of the show, but now I'am really liking where it's gone. I've enjoyed every episode. This isn't a just by the numbers, clich&eacute; crime-show like the rest. Nope. They really go inside these killers minds and they go inside the minds of the profilers too.Gideon's partners Agent Aaron Hotch (Thomas Gibson who leads the unit but still takes much input from Gideon) , Special Agent Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore whose role is to provide the muscle ) then there is Spencer Reid a ""by the book"" geek at first glance  (hell he looks like a kid) but is really intelligent.I also  like the character of Elle Greenway (Lola Glaudini), she's tough and speaks her mind. She and Derek have this gender battle going which is funny. In the pilot, they are tracking killer who likes to keep his victims alive for seven days before killing them, thus exploiting them. The killer is pretty clever, and eventually the team realizes that their profile (like most agents will tell ya) are wrong, and thus they start back to the drawing board.They hit pay dirt with by tracking some geek who doesn't appear to be a killer but upon further inspection (he has clippings of Gideon's past work as an agent and rubs it in), and thus the case is broken wide open. However it's not over, Gideon doesn't think by the profile that this kid is as crazy as he seems and his right, he eventually comes up with a theory that they are two killers. The next couple of scenes are well executed, yet very familiar. They play the good cop/bad cop routine, and use the familiar, ""your partner squealed on you bit"" to bluff one idiot to reveal the whereabouts of the other. Yes I know it's standard stuff but actually this is still part of the strategy of most profilers.That's another thing I like about the show while some episodes are standard they really give you a wide array of killers and personalities to look at it. There's a dysfunctional religious fanatic in one episode, then a cult in the next episode , then a serial rapist here and even a case involving vigilante murders in another episode.The acting for this series is great too with Thomas Gibson, Mandy Patinkin, Shemar Moore and newbie Matthew Gruber. Gruber is one of these persons that stumbled onto acting and really got a once in a lifetime opportunity to model and act.The DVD is very well done with all the episodes from the first season, deleted scenes and more. If you're  a fan of the show it's a must have. Even if you're not a fan, I would still recommend it if you're into crime drama shows as ""Criminal Minds"" is one of the best tv shows of this genre today.

I made the mistake of starting to watching while my kids were playing in the room.  If you have kids, this isn't exactly kiddie-friendly fare.  There are killings, obviously, and quite a bit of violence.  They don't always show exactly what is happening, but the implied violence and sometimes the audio (ie, screaming) can be a little stomach-turning at times.  Once I realized it was a tad more graphic than I anticipated, I turned it off and waited until the kids were in bed before watching any more.For me, the show is interesting and many episodes/characters draw inspiration from real-life killers and cases.  Some episodes were a little gross and there were two or three that found me fast-forwarding the more violent portions.  For those who are extremely sensitive, this may not be the best show.  Otherwise, it is about the same as watching a scary movie.

Castle is very light-hearted, NCIS and CSI are progressively darker, and I'd say Criminal Minds is the darkest of the 4.The cast they've gathered is superb. Agent Gideon's the one with a dark past a serial bomber likes to throw in his face. Agent Hotchner's the family man who struggles to balance the two. Elle's the one out to prove she can do this very tough job. Dr. Reid's the baby of the group, but a genius all the same. Penelope's a nice comic relief computer guru. Derek Morgan's the easy on the eyes door kicker of the group. He likes to role play the killers to get inside their minds and figure out what makes them work.The first season is a bit hit or miss in my opinion in terms of individual episodes, but the last two in the season leave you with a great feeling and a cliff hanger to boot. Okay, so maybe the cliff hanger thing isn't such a great feeling, but it prompts you to immediately go out and buy another season, so it did its job.I remember not liking Ride the Lightning and a few of the episodes were just okay, but just as many or more were excellent. If you're a fan of police procedural type shows and can handle the dark nature of the content, then you'll likely enjoy this.I'll admit it took me a while to get drawn into the show, but I stuck it out and ended up loving the end of the season.

The first season has some pretty intense segments focusing on serial killers, kidnappers, arsonists and all kinds of assorted baddies.The cast is top notch:  Mandy Patinkin returns to tv after CHICAGO HOPE to play the post-traumatic stressed head of the team.  Patinkin has a way with his serious moments, as well as his lighthearted ones.  Thomas Gibson plays Aaron Hotchner, the father to be who has a cool demeanor and a no-nonsense attitude.  Gibson is a little too monotonous but I'm not sure if it's his fault or the way his character has been written.  Lola Glaudini is the token female agent, her expertise being sex crimes--she has a strength that makes her character believable.  Matthew Gray Gubler is the token nerd who seems to know everything about everything, but I like his performance and he adds a lot to the series; Shemar Morris is the hunky agent who is a little bit of a maverick agent, but he's fine for the role; Kirsten Vangness joins NCIS' Pauley Perrette as a real gem of a supporting player as the territorial computer whiz Jennifer Garcia.Each episode is well paced and brisk and I really enjoyed them!",5,MIND GAMES,1165449600,"12 7, 2006",2006,1275,"['CRIMINAL', 'MINDS', 'very', 'good', 'police', 'procedural', 'show', 'team', 'FBI', 'profilers', 'who', 'get', 'heads', 'nefarious', 'villians', 'first', 'season', 'pretty', 'intense', 'segments', 'focusing', 'serial', 'killers', 'kidnappers', 'arsonists', 'kinds', 'assorted', 'baddies.The', 'cast', 'top', 'notch', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'tv', 'CHICAGO', 'HOPE', 'play', 'post-traumatic', 'stressed', 'head', 'team', 'Patinkin', 'way', 'serious', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'lighthearted', 'ones', 'Thomas', 'Gibson', 'Aaron', 'Hotchner', 'father', 'be', 'who', 'cool', 'demeanor', 'no-nonsense', 'attitude', 'Gibson', 'little', 'too', 'monotonous', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'fault', 'way', 'character', 'been', 'written', 'Lola', 'Glaudini', 'token', 'female', 'agent', 'expertise', 'being', 'sex', 'crimes', 'strength', 'character', 'believable', 'Matthew', 'Gray', 'Gubler', 'token', 'nerd', 'who', 'know', 'everything', 'everything', 'like', 'performance', 'lot', 'series', 'Shemar', 'Morris', 'hunky', 'agent', 'who', 'little', 'bit', 'maverick', 'agent', 'fine', 'role', 'Kirsten', 'Vangness', 'NCIS', 'Pauley', 'Perrette', 'real', 'gem', 'supporting', 'player', 'territorial', 'computer', 'whiz', 'Jennifer', 'Garcia.Each', 'episode', 'well', 'paced', 'brisk', 'really', 'enjoyed']",N/A

I'm not normally interested in serial killer plots, but I like most of the BAU team and in general the episodes were smart, mysterious, and kept you guessing.  In this particular season, some of the acting was sub-par, but it didn't detract from the show too much - another reviewer said the characters are much more settled into their roles in season 2, so I look forward to seeing that.  I also prefer Paget Brewster's character (who comes in during later seasons) to Lola Glaudini's.My only real criticism of this season is that for as brilliant as the team is supposed to be (""one of the best teams in the world"" according to a character on the show), they sure ask alot of dumb questions.  I think this was for the benefit of the audience, to ""teach"" us about profiling and criminal behavior, but there were many times when one character would draw a conclusion about the suspect they were looking for, and another team member would ask why they thought that...and as a non-profiling audience member, I already knew the answer and thought this expert profiler should be able to figure it out too!  :-)  In spite of this, I did enjoy watching season 1, and am hoping to find season 2 at a low price as well.

Thomas Gibson as Aaron Hotchner, the very handsome Shemar Moore as Derek Morgan and Matthew Grey Gubler as the always geeky and know-it-all Dr. Spencer Reid.

They are criminal profilers and as the evidence gathers and their knowledge converges the profile os the UNSUB (unknown subject) leads them, hopefully to a resolution.

Since its debut on CBS in the fall of 2005, the program has impressed viewers not only with its excellent cast, but also with top-notch writing and production.  Criminal Minds follows a group of profilers from the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit who track down a broad range of criminals, including serial killers, rapists, arsonists/bombers and child abductors, among others.  The profilers get inside the heads of these criminals by establishing psychological profiles of their subjects and thinking as they do.Mandy Patinkin (Chicago Hope) stars as Special Agent Jason Gideon, and Thomas Gibson (Dharma & Greg) is Special Agent Aaron Hotchner.  Gideon and Hotchner head up the BAU team.  Each member of the team has his or her own area of expertise.  Derek Morgan (former soap star Shemar Moore) specializes in obsessive crimes, while Elle Greenaway (Lola Glaudini) has a background in sexual offenses.  Matthew Gray Gubler is Dr. Spencer Reid, the geeky, socially-challenged genius.  A.J. Cook plays rookie agent Jennifer ""J.J."" Jareau, and Kirsten Vangsness is Penelope Garcia, the techie.  The producers have assembled an excellent cast, with each actor well suited for his/her role, and they have great chemistry, playing off each other very well.The writers and producers of Criminal Minds consult with staff at the real-life Behavioral Analysis Unit in Quantico, Virginia.  This allows the writers to come up with some incredibly realistic storylines for the show.  It is because of this gritty realism that some of the stories come off incredibly dark and heavy, as seen in one episode in which a serial killer forces husbands to watch while their families are murdered and the killer collects the husbands' wedding rings.  Many of the writers have confessed that these darker plots have been very difficult for them to write, and some have said writing for this program has been so creepy that they have been checking the doors and windows in their own homes.DVD bonus features include three featurettes.  The first is ""The Making of Criminal Minds"" which includes comments from the show's creators, writers and producers as well as the cast members.  ""Inside Quantico and the Criminal Mind"" takes a look inside the real-life FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit in Quantico, Virginia.  The third featurette is ""Meet Matthew Gray Gubler,"" a look at the actor who plays Dr. Spencer Reid, which includes comments from his co-stars, and the production staff was well as from Gubler himself.  There are also commentary tracks for several episodes.  Along with the original CSI, Criminal Minds is one of my favorite programs on television today.

1002486,A2KXYGIZI4I55D,B000GEIRF0,Romulus,"[1, 2]","I am so grateful for this series. The serious approach to serial killers is something that no other show is doing right now. They may deal with them occasionally but not every single episode. The characters are all intelligent, likeable and memorable and the method of profiling never ceases to amaze me. Mandy Pitinkin's fatherly manner and quiet, unrushed voice has a silent authority that far surpasses the hyper theatrical antics of most authority figures in police procedural. The family man/cold profiler Hotch is a major break from his role as Greg of ABC's Dharma and Greg. He is almost unrecognizable. Derek Morgan develops an interesting big brother like relationship with Dr. Spencer Reid and Elle Greenaway that is wonderful to watch. The dynamics between everyone is great to watch. The absence of unneeded family/personal drama from everyone is quite refreshing. The focus of each episode is soley aimed at collecting clues, profiling the suspect and finding him. While this may sound formulaic, there are even variations in each episode to keep it all interesting. The only exception is, sadly the season finale, the Fisher King (and its continuation at the beginning of the Second Season). The whole deal with an Unsub that knows everything about everyone, moves with ease and without detection despite being horribly burned and being slowed down by it, the whole lame Quest deal with blood written on the wall and clues given to each member of the team was very poorly done. And these fiercely intelligent characters are dumbed down to making obvious errors that even we non-profilers could have picked up.

Amongst those are oftentimes the worst of the worst and the most painful places that a person can go, leading to all sorts of damage and all sorts of baddies. The FBI's agents are not immune to this, either, and some of those scars are easy to see. When dealing with the head of the unit, for example, you see a man with pain that seems to be overwhelming him. You also see new faces mingling with older faces, minds mingling with badges, and all of them making up a unit that is above and beyond the call of most of law enforcement entities. This is good, too, because the world is filled with bad guys and there needs to be closure. Here closure is oftentimes a one episode thing, although it sometimes leads into two.With a genre almost toppled and overflowing, it is hard to imagine something fresh and good to the tasteuds. Still, Criminal Minds is that and more, leading to a thing that has changed as it goes along. People come and people go, but in the beginning things were just starting. Here, people had less technology and more footwork, leading to a blend of profiling and thinking things out. The people do use computer and they do look up old things, but the profiles are normally the way into a bad guy's mind and the way to a conviction. They come to life in this season, too, with the lay out here and in the next season richer than any other. That is one of the things I liked here, and one of the things that makes it different even when compared to other season of Criminal Minds.Other things to like are the way the people come together and the way they really are. In two season you get to where you really like these people, and you see the things they have to deal with. Of all those is Gideon, who is in command and who seems to hurt. He makes decisions and he lives with what happens, and this stuff really smarts. He is the most human of them all, too, and the most like a person when the chips fall. you see this in the first two progressions of the show, with it all finalizing until it is something big and beautiful. They all play a part, and this reminds you of it.The episode work is something else to admire, from the story to the way it comes together. You never know where it will happen, wht will happen, and who will be involved. Sometimes a person comes back and sometimes a person surpises us all, and that is what is about. It is other things, too, like the personal lives of the agents and the way they juggle this delicate beast.I like it - a lot.You should check it out at the least and see what you think. I was not for it at first, but it grew on me and kept growing, leaving little to fall back on. That's good, too, and better still when you recall what it all is.

Picking out cues as to the criminal's personality, motives and future actions (through their MOs and signatures, including the brutality of the crimes and how much torture was inflicted prior to death), they work as the ultimate in police triage agents, catching the most psychotic and heartless individuals before they can slaughter more innocent victims.Among my favourite episodes include:Won't get Fooled Again (Gideon faces off against a bomber he caught and imprisoned (but managed to inspire a disciple outside his super-max prison).

In these cases forensic science is NOT enough to catch a killer. Bones and CSI and the rest tend to make you believe that ANY crime can be solved by trace evidence. That is not always the case, especially with smart killers, predators.The show gives you a small look at what some of the law enforcement people go through catching these monsters, and maybe a look into the minds of the monsters and a hint of how they got that way.Sure these shows are nothing like real life and we know that they're not always accurate. But this show gives you the feeling of real. You'll find  yourself laughing and crying and empathizing with every character as they change and grow and learn under the most stressful conditions. It gives you a peek at the emotional damage and turmoil that dealing with this type of criminal activity can bring about in the people exposed to it.The show writers have done an excellent job. I didn't notice any slips at all. No gaping plot gaps either, the dialogue is interesting and can keep you interested until the end credits roll and then you just take a big breath. The show is definitely a rollercoaster ride.This first season is the team learning about one enother and how to trust one another, while being confronted with all the reasons in the world not to trust, as they work their way through gruesome crimes by using good invetigative techniques and delving into the way the killers behave and think, what they feel.",5,What can I say?
