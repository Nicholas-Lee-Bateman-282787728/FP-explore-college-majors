I suggest to him, and to those of his ilk, that it is hypocritical of him to single out America for its moral faults, ignoring the greater faults of other governments, while at the same time living in America and enjoying its benefits and protection which are in part the result of those faults. I suggest to Mr Enright, or whatever his name really is since his writing and his politics resemble that of a USA-bashing Chicano, that he and Mr Chomsky relocate to that place in world that enjoys moral superiority over the USA. Why don't you move to Iran and devote your life to publicly criticizing its government for the public hangings by slow strangulation of teenagers? You won't because you are a coward. It is easy to be brave when you enjoy the safety of a country, despite its faults, as civilized as the United States.",5,A Refreshingly Unvarnished Representation of the Enemy's Face,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,939,"['reviewer', 'Preston', 'C.', 'Enright', 'see', 'bias', 'USA', 'review', 'many', 'others', 'suggest', 'ilk', 'hypocritical', 'single', 'out', 'America', 'moral', 'faults', 'ignoring', 'greater', 'faults', 'other', 'governments', 'same', 'time', 'living', 'America', 'enjoying', 'benefits', 'protection', 'are', 'part', 'result', 'faults', 'suggest', 'Mr', 'Enright', 'whatever', 'name', 'really', 'writing', 'politics', 'resemble', 'USA-bashing', 'Chicano', 'Mr', 'Chomsky', 'relocate', 'place', 'world', 'moral', 'superiority', 'USA', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'move', 'Iran', 'devote', 'life', 'publicly', 'criticizing', 'government', 'public', 'hangings', 'slow', 'strangulation', 'teenagers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'are', 'coward', 'easy', 'be', 'brave', 'when', 'enjoy', 'safety', 'country', 'faults', 'as', 'civilized', 'United', 'States']","Islam: What the West Needs to Know - An examination of Islam, Violence, and the Fate of the Non-Muslim World."
1008858,A1TUDEC66M9FO3,B000H0UPKI,Preston C. Enright,"[28, 114]","As should be expected from a propaganda campaign, ""Islam: What the West Needs to Know"" accuses the victims of the West of doing what the West is doing to people in the Middle East (and Latin America, and Africa).  The transnational conglomerates that direct the policies of the West are pushing ""neoliberal"" economics that are advanced by violence.  To avoid this reality, the victims of that violence are portrayed as the actual ""evil-doers.""  But for those who are interested in facts, they don't have to research very hard to realize that it is Western-based corporations that have a ""violent, expansionary ideology that seeks to conquer any contradictory religion, culture, and, ultimately, government.""  Hence, the long history of the West invading countries in the Middle East, Latin America and Africa.  The West has a habit of colonizing those it deems inferior, and even committing genocide against them as in the case of Native Americans, some African tribes, and indigenous people throughout Latin America who stand in the way of mining, timber and oil development (ecocidal projects that are defined as ""progress"").Willam Blum's ""Rogue State"", the DVD ""Why We Fight,"" magazines like ""Z,"" and websites like Amazon Watch"" will give people plenty of information about how their society is the aggressor in the world.  Sadly, most people don't want to face that reality.  So, they'll just go on being ""good Germans"", or, using the current term, ""great Americans"" (ie. Sean Hannity and his willfully-ignorant listeners).""The most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed."" -Steven Biko, South African freedom fighter",1,Accusing others of what the Western empire does,1164240000,"11 23, 2006",2006,1657,"['should', 'be', 'expected', 'propaganda', 'campaign', 'Islam', 'What', 'West', 'Know', 'victims', 'West', 'doing', 'what', 'West', 'doing', 'people', 'Middle', 'East', 'Latin', 'America', 'Africa', 'transnational', 'conglomerates', 'direct', 'policies', 'West', 'are', 'pushing', 'neoliberal', 'economics', 'are', 'advanced', 'violence', 'avoid', 'reality', 'victims', 'violence', 'are', 'portrayed', 'actual', 'evil-doers', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'facts', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'research', 'very', 'hard', 'realize', 'Western-based', 'corporations', 'have', 'violent', 'expansionary', 'ideology', 'conquer', 'contradictory', 'religion', 'culture', 'ultimately', 'government', 'Hence', 'long', 'history', 'West', 'invading', 'countries', 'Middle', 'East', 'Latin', 'America', 'Africa', 'West', 'habit', 'colonizing', 'inferior', 'even', 'committing', 'genocide', 'case', 'Native', 'Americans', 'African', 'tribes', 'indigenous', 'people', 'Latin', 'America', 'who', 'stand', 'way', 'mining', 'timber', 'oil', 'development', 'ecocidal', 'projects', 'are', 'defined', 'progress', '.Willam', 'Blum', 'Rogue', 'State', 'DVD', 'Why', 'Fight', 'magazines', 'Z', 'Amazon', 'Watch', 'will', 'give', 'people', 'plenty', 'information', 'how', 'society', 'aggressor', 'world', 'Sadly', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'face', 'reality', 'So', ""'ll"", 'just', 'go', 'being', 'good', 'Germans', 'using', 'current', 'term', 'great', 'Americans', 'ie', 'Sean', 'Hannity', 'willfully-ignorant', 'listeners', 'most', 'powerful', 'weapon', 'hands', 'oppressor', 'mind', 'oppressed', '-Steven', 'Biko', 'South', 'African', 'freedom', 'fighter']","Islam: What the West Needs to Know - An examination of Islam, Violence, and the Fate of the Non-Muslim World."
1008859,AT7CXVV43ZSRX,B000H0UPKI,"Reading Fan ""Romans 8:1""","[8, 10]","`What part of the word ""kill"" do you not understand?'  This is the question asked at large by former PLO terrorist turned Christian Walid Shoebat. He and Islamic expert Robert Spencer and others present compelling evidence that the goal of Islam is world domination and death to those who do not submit. They present surahs from the Koran, the sacred scriptures of Islam, as well as quotes from the Hadith, the life and sayings of the Prophet Mohammed, the duel foundation books for Islam.  They point to the centuries of Islamic violence on the rest of the world in the name of Allah, finally stopped and pushed back outside of Vienna on September 11, 1683.  The jihad was re-started 300+  years later on our September 11 when the U.S. was attacked by Bin Laden's suicide bombers.Meanwhile, we hear President Bush, Secretary of State Condi Rice, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair giving sound-bites in this DVD about how tolerant and peaceful Islam is `except for the extremists'. This DVD says that all the true followers of Islam, not just extremists, are called to acts of violence in the name of Allah.  The moderates, per the DVD, are portrayed as misled since the more recent war-like quotations of Mohammed `abrogate' the corresponding early more-peaceful quotations of Mohammed.  They say the Prophet's sayings became more war-like as his power grew and he had more freedom to speak his mind.  We are told that it is honorable to lie in the name of Allah if it is for his cause, the expansion of his religion. Further, it is deemed honorable to die for the cause even if though suicide is forbidden; in fact it is the only sure way to heaven for a Moslem. This doctrine is even taught to grammar school kids as a long-range recruiting tool; this is illustrated by disturbing footage of children calling-in and offering future suicide services to the cause of Islam.The film ends with an Iranian cleric, wielding a long sword, screaming `jihad' over and over again to an adoring, screaming mob of his followers.  It reminded me of Adolf Hitler mesmerizing his followers in the 1930's.I would have sincerely liked to have heard opposing points of view, maybe some reasonable explanations of the issues raised here (if any exist) and that Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance.But if this DVD is accurate, and it surely seems it is, it is more than a little scary!",5,More than a little scary!!,1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,2379,"['What', 'part', 'word', 'kill', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'question', 'asked', 'large', 'former', 'PLO', 'terrorist', 'turned', 'Christian', 'Walid', 'Shoebat', 'Islamic', 'expert', 'Robert', 'Spencer', 'others', 'present', 'compelling', 'evidence', 'goal', 'Islam', 'world', 'domination', 'death', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'submit', 'present', 'surahs', 'Koran', 'sacred', 'scriptures', 'Islam', 'as', 'well', 'quotes', 'Hadith', 'life', 'sayings', 'Prophet', 'Mohammed', 'duel', 'foundation', 'books', 'Islam', 'point', 'centuries', 'Islamic', 'violence', 'rest', 'world', 'name', 'Allah', 'finally', 'stopped', 'pushed', 'back', 'Vienna', 'September', '11', '1683', 'jihad', 'was', 're-started', '300+', 'years', 'later', 'September', '11', 'when', 'U.S.', 'was', 'attacked', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'suicide', 'bombers.Meanwhile', 'hear', 'President', 'Bush', 'Secretary', 'State', 'Condi', 'Rice', 'British', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'giving', 'sound-bites', 'DVD', 'how', 'tolerant', 'peaceful', 'Islam', 'extremists', 'DVD', 'true', 'followers', 'Islam', 'not', 'just', 'extremists', 'are', 'called', 'acts', 'violence', 'name', 'Allah', 'moderates', 'DVD', 'are', 'portrayed', 'misled', 'more', 'recent', 'war-like', 'quotations', 'Mohammed', 'abrogate', 'corresponding', 'early', 'more-peaceful', 'quotations', 'Mohammed', 'say', 'Prophet', 'sayings', 'became', 'more', 'war-like', 'power', 'grew', 'had', 'more', 'freedom', 'speak', 'mind', 'are', 'told', 'honorable', 'lie', 'name', 'Allah', 'cause', 'expansion', 'religion', 'Further', 'deemed', 'honorable', 'die', 'cause', 'even', 'suicide', 'forbidden', 'fact', 'only', 'sure', 'way', 'heaven', 'Moslem', 'doctrine', 'even', 'taught', 'grammar', 'school', 'kids', 'long-range', 'recruiting', 'tool', 'illustrated', 'disturbing', 'footage', 'children', 'calling-in', 'offering', 'future', 'suicide', 'services', 'cause', 'Islam.The', 'film', 'Iranian', 'cleric', 'wielding', 'long', 'sword', 'screaming', 'jihad', 'over', 'again', 'adoring', 'screaming', 'mob', 'followers', 'reminded', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'mesmerizing', 'followers', ""1930's.I"", 'would', 'have', 'sincerely', 'liked', 'have', 'heard', 'opposing', 'points', 'view', 'maybe', 'reasonable', 'explanations', 'issues', 'raised', 'here', 'exist', 'Islam', 'religion', 'peace', 'tolerance.But', 'DVD', 'accurate', 'surely', 'more', 'little', 'scary']","Islam: What the West Needs to Know - An examination of Islam, Violence, and the Fate of the Non-Muslim World."
