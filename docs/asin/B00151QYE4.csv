1147962,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B00151QYE4,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[1, 1]","Four Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days (2007) is a film that throws you into the world of illegal abortion, the price, the fear, the risk, the aftermath.  And, mostly, it is about friendship and obligation.  The setting takes place in Romania, 1987.  Two college roommates arrange to obtain money for an illegal abortionist, a character of slime, who further asks for sexual favors.  The abortion is performed.The film has won many major awards, it is filmed with no music whatsoever.  Although not a documentary, the viewer gets this impression and feeling.  The film has many tense moments, moments that make the viewer feel and understand the desperation a young person takes, and yet the tragic cruelty of an abortion, if one is on that side.  We feel for the friend (Otilia) who risks a lot to help her friend, taking the time for the necessity of making this happen, yet she also obligates herself to be at a dinner party with her boyfriend's family.  The scenes are filled with tension, as we know the abortion will happen and must happen safely.  What is especially tense as Otilla's task to destroy the fetus, and that longshot scene in the dark, lonely, fearful, stressful back streets in order to destroy it.DVD Bonus!Don't miss the wonderful interviews with the director, who offers in great length his motives and challenges to do the film.  He covers everything, and refers to many scenes, etc.  And more interesting is the insight to the very few theatres in Romania and its challenges for the director.  Plus, the cinematographer provides extensive information into the lighting used, and the long shots into that fearful night, a girl alone with a fetus to destroy.  If one is into the art of filmmaking, this is very informative.  Excellent movie for all to see.  ....Rizzo",5,The challenge involved with an illegal abortion,1228694400,"12 8, 2008",2008,1783,"['Four', 'Months', '3', 'Weeks', '2', 'Days', '2007', 'film', 'world', 'illegal', 'abortion', 'price', 'fear', 'risk', 'aftermath', 'mostly', 'friendship', 'obligation', 'setting', 'place', 'Romania', '1987', 'Two', 'college', 'roommates', 'arrange', 'obtain', 'money', 'illegal', 'abortionist', 'character', 'slime', 'who', 'further', 'asks', 'sexual', 'favors', 'abortion', 'performed.The', 'film', 'won', 'many', 'major', 'awards', 'filmed', 'music', 'whatsoever', 'not', 'documentary', 'viewer', 'impression', 'feeling', 'film', 'many', 'tense', 'moments', 'moments', 'make', 'viewer', 'feel', 'understand', 'desperation', 'young', 'person', 'yet', 'tragic', 'cruelty', 'abortion', 'one', 'side', 'feel', 'friend', 'Otilia', 'who', 'risks', 'lot', 'help', 'friend', 'taking', 'time', 'necessity', 'making', 'happen', 'also', 'be', 'dinner', 'party', 'boyfriend', 'family', 'scenes', 'are', 'filled', 'tension', 'know', 'abortion', 'will', 'happen', 'must', 'happen', 'safely', 'What', 'especially', 'tense', 'Otilla', 'task', 'destroy', 'fetus', 'longshot', 'scene', 'dark', 'lonely', 'fearful', 'stressful', 'back', 'streets', 'order', 'destroy', 'it.DVD', 'Bonus', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'wonderful', 'interviews', 'director', 'who', 'great', 'length', 'motives', 'challenges', 'do', 'film', 'everything', 'refers', 'many', 'scenes', 'etc', 'more', 'interesting', 'insight', 'very', 'few', 'theatres', 'Romania', 'challenges', 'director', 'cinematographer', 'extensive', 'information', 'lighting', 'used', 'long', 'shots', 'fearful', 'night', 'girl', 'alone', 'fetus', 'destroy', 'one', 'art', 'filmmaking', 'very', 'informative', 'Excellent', 'movie', 'see', '.Rizzo']","4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days"
1147963,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B00151QYE4,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[49, 55]","What if it was true?Almost no one would answer the question on what would happen if abortions WERE outlawed by the State. Would we jail the women? Kill the abortionists? It's out of the question in a civilized nation. Right? Well... not exactly. Communist Romania did outlaw abortion during the 70's and 80's. The reasons were not exactly humanitarian but the end result was that early abortions were punished with a few years in prison and late term abortions, past the 4th month were treated as murders. This is the telling of a (possibly true) story from those years. It's an illustration of what we here, in the States, like to call a `back alley abortion'. The back alley, in this case, is a hotel room, a rather decent one.The visual environment and the way characters interact are consistent with Romania's impoverished status back in 1987 - there's little color, little hope, few lights at night, little joy. The few extras we see are shown as small, disoriented, defeated people performing absurd or incomprehensible (to us) activities such as wandering aimlessly in the night, lining up in queues or risking whatever was left of their freedom for some meager black market profits. Everyone seems to be indifferent, corruptible, bored, boring, alone, lonely but surprisingly well-mannered, given the circumstances. Had this been a Hollywood production, we might have ended up watching a zombie or a body-snatcher type of a movie but this one was made in East Europe and the Hollywood advisers didn't bother to offer their precious advice so what we see are the memories of a reality not completely dead.Gabriela (Gabi) is a senior student who shares a dorm room and has a good friend in Otilia. She seems to understand little about the facts of life and, once she turns pregnant, she tries to do what everyone viewed as the `natural' choice those days - end the pregnancy through an abortion.Otilia is Gabi's roommate and her best friend. She makes everything happen while Gabi is passively waiting for the problem to go away. A senior student, Otilia views her own future either as living a boring life, helping run some remote factory or as a possible housewife following her 'man', making mashed potatoes and maybe playing mommy for him. She is under no illusion that he would ever stand up for her if not doing so was a more convenient or a safer option. Living in a dorm, sharing a room with Gabriela, she has no choice but mature a little. She is dating the son of a more well-to-do family but she doesn't expect much from him beyond some brief moments of intimacy. She feels obligated to help Gabriela because no one else would and, if she didn't, she would be completely alone. She's not only Gabi's friend, she's her mother too because she needs to care about someone and because no one else would volunteer.Otilia's boyfriend (forgot the name) at 23 or 24 is still his mother's baby. Otilia doesn't trust him with much beyond his ability to provide her with a little intimacy.Bebe, the abortionist, is a loving son who doesn't forget to stop and make sure that his old, helpless mother is okay on his way to the abortion. He is quite good at what he does. He sterilizes his tools; he is using antibiotics and provides good post-procedure advice. He even offers to make a free follow up visit. He is also demanding some special type of compensation for his services.Otilia is the main character. All throughout the movie, the camera follows her and all others are relevant to the extent that Otilia interacts with them. This makes sense because she is the only one who DOES anything. Everyone else appears to be devoid of initiative or free will. The plot is simple. Gabi wants to have her (illegal) abortion but she waits for Otilia to do most of the work and take most of the risks. It gets to a point where Otilia accepts having sex with the abortionist as payment for his services. Once the abortion is complete, Otilia helps dispose of the baby and life continues.Gabriela, the pregnant one, has given up on almost everything. She seems to be willing to allow for ""things"" to be done for her or to her. She lies and she begs to get by. She is made pregnant, she lets Otilia arrange for her own abortion while she's busy waxing her legs, she lets the abortionist handle her body and she's not afraid because Otilia is there, watching, she doesn't object to his taking his pay by having sex with Otilia. She doesn't demand that Otilia agrees to that `payment' but she begs the abortionist not to leave when Otilia does not appear to be in the mood to pay with her own body. After the baby is aborted, Otilia, again, is the one who disposes of the little body while Gabi goes down to the restaurant, waiting for her return. The frightening suspicion (my suspicion) is that Gabi probably knew what type of `payment' the abortionist was going to demand but she goes along with it all because that option was going to be `cheaper'.Overall, while `abortion' is what all of this seems to be about, the more subtle and the more frightening aspect is the background and IT is important because this movie is meant to be a snapshot of life `then'. What we see is a nation or a world where meaningful interactions beyond some immediate family ties are close to non-existent. Paradoxically, while the communist utopia called for a society where individuals were perfectly integrated into their communities, what we observe is a caricature Hobbesian world. It's a world were all the good pickings were already picked by some invisible entities and everyone else is struggling for the leftovers and they are allowed to do so for as long as they are not overtly disruptive to the imposed order. The symbolism is subtle but powerful - Otilia walking or running around on her numerous errands, usually at night, always alone, followed by or crossing paths with stray dogs and strangers without faces, the omnipresent policemen, Otilia and Gabi being served leftovers from a wedding at their post-abortion meal. There are no or little moral concerns. Whatever works is good for as long as it works and that includes Gabriela's choice to abort. No one - Gabriela, Otilia, Bebe - ever expresses any second thoughts about the morality of what they were about to do, their concerns seem to be about Gabi's health (infection), the inconvenience of her possibly having to wait for a day or two before the artificial miscarriage takes place and the risks of being caught and punished. Gabi does seem to show some sympathy for her baby AFTER it is all done and the baby lies on the bathroom floor, as she asks Otilia to bury him rather than throw the little body in the trash. It's frightening because the world used to be like that THERE and THEN and it's frightening because, chance areit seems, the world is trending in that direction EVERYWHERE but, hopefully, not FOREVER.I am giving this movie 5 stars not because the Frenchies gave it their Palme d'Or at Cannes but because this movie is unafraid to discuss topics that us, Americans, not unlike Otilia's boyfriend, can only accept when served to us in the form of brightly-colored sci-fi, make-believe allegories that can't possibly be real. It gets stars for courage, for Anamaria Marinca's (Otilia) acting, for the director's ability to tell a hard to tell, horrifying story.Little notes: there is no overt violence, there is some brief nudity but sexual activities are not explicitly displayed. The aborted, bloodied fetus is shown. The dialogues are in Romanian with English and Spanish subtitles available. There is no music, sound effects, explosions or any other kind of special effects.DVD Extras:- A short documentary following a German 'movie caravan' that, after the Palme d'Or award, attempted to show the movie to Romanians.

1147964,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B00151QYE4,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[2, 4]","The scene is Romania, 1987, two years before the revolution. Under the dictatorship, abortion is illegal. This is a bleak world of food shortages, crumbling buildings, social dereliction -- a society in which everyone watches everyone else. Women must submit to regular compulsory gynecological examinations; doctors have quotas on increasing childbirth.Gabriela, a young student, is pregnant. She enlists her roommate Otilia, to help her have an illegal abortion.This is a tough, honest, unflinching movie that could probably never be made in the United States. The camera does not pull away; we are spared very little.Of course, there is one absolutely appalling act at the heart of this movie -- but it is not the abortion itself. I won't give it away.We see the girls try to get a hotel room, struggling with unhelpful and intrusive bureaucrats, giving little bribes. Otilia meets the abortionist, who initially comes across as reasonable and is only later revealed as a monster. We see her trying to balance her relationship with her boyfriend and his family, with her duty to her friend, which leads her to risk prison. In one painful scene, she comes to the realization that if she were to get pregnant, she'd be on her own.This movie features a riveting performance by Anamaria Marinca as Otilia. Her friend, Gabriela, also well played by Laura Valiliu, is weak and selfish and uses her weakness as a tool to manipulate others. The one weak point of this movie is why Otilia is ready to do so much and risk so much for a friend who is so pathetic and unwilling to take responsibility.There is a political subtext of course. We in the United States are perhaps one or two Supreme Court votes away from returning to a world of underground abortions. That world, as we see in this movie, is evil, dangerous and exploitative. The monstrous things is not the abortion itself but the system that forces women to take such appalling risks.",5,"tough, unflinching look at illegal abortion",1228435200,"12 5, 2008",2008,1940,"['scene', 'Romania', '1987', 'two', 'years', 'revolution', 'dictatorship', 'abortion', 'illegal', 'bleak', 'world', 'food', 'shortages', 'crumbling', 'buildings', 'social', 'dereliction', 'society', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'else', 'Women', 'must', 'submit', 'regular', 'compulsory', 'gynecological', 'examinations', 'doctors', 'have', 'quotas', 'increasing', 'childbirth.Gabriela', 'young', 'student', 'pregnant', 'roommate', 'Otilia', 'help', 'have', 'illegal', 'abortion.This', 'tough', 'honest', 'unflinching', 'movie', 'could', 'probably', 'never', 'be', 'made', 'United', 'States', 'camera', 'not', 'pull', 'away', 'are', 'spared', 'very', 'little.Of', 'course', 'one', 'absolutely', 'appalling', 'act', 'heart', 'movie', 'not', 'abortion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away.We', 'see', 'girls', 'try', 'get', 'hotel', 'room', 'struggling', 'unhelpful', 'intrusive', 'bureaucrats', 'giving', 'little', 'bribes', 'Otilia', 'abortionist', 'who', 'initially', 'across', 'reasonable', 'only', 'later', 'revealed', 'monster', 'see', 'trying', 'balance', 'relationship', 'boyfriend', 'family', 'duty', 'friend', 'risk', 'prison', 'one', 'painful', 'scene', 'realization', 'were', 'get', 'pregnant', ""'d"", 'be', 'own.This', 'movie', 'riveting', 'performance', 'Anamaria', 'Marinca', 'Otilia', 'friend', 'Gabriela', 'also', 'well', 'played', 'Laura', 'Valiliu', 'weak', 'selfish', 'weakness', 'tool', 'manipulate', 'others', 'one', 'weak', 'point', 'movie', 'why', 'Otilia', 'ready', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'risk', 'so', 'much', 'friend', 'who', 'so', 'pathetic', 'unwilling', 'take', 'responsibility.There', 'political', 'subtext', 'course', 'United', 'States', 'are', 'perhaps', 'one', 'two', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'away', 'returning', 'world', 'underground', 'abortions', 'world', 'see', 'movie', 'evil', 'dangerous', 'exploitative', 'monstrous', 'things', 'not', 'abortion', 'system', 'women', 'take', 'such', 'appalling', 'risks']","4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days"
1147965,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00151QYE4,Alex Udvary,"[48, 52]","Some films are able to dazzle you without the use of special effects, big Hollywood stars and nudity. They manage to crawl under your skin and get inside you. They leave an indeliable mark on you. Cristian Mungiu's ""4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days (4 luni, 3 saptamani si 2 zile)"" is such a film. And easily one of the best films of 2007!Whatever the reason, currently Romanian is a hot property. People and critics are just buzzing with excitement about what is going on in Romanian cinema. And even though I'm not Romanian (I'm Hungarian) I'm pretty excited about it too.In 2006 there was the release of ""The Death of Mr. Lazarescu"", besides ""4 luni, 3 saptamani si 2 zile"", also released in 2007 was ""12:08 East of Bucharest"". These three films seem to be part of a new wave in Romanian film. Each takes on modern day society while questioning the past. All three are confrontational.""4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days"" takes place during a 24 hour period in which a young girl, Gabita Dragut (Laura Vasiliu) seeks an abortion in Ceausescu's Romania. At the time such acts were against the law. She needs the help of her roommate, Otilia (Anamaria Marinca) to sort out the details and supply some support, since the father of the child is not only never seen but never spoken of either.The two girls get in contact with Bebe (Vlad Ivanou) through a mutual friend. Bebe is the only person who will perform an abortion after the 4th month, this is how the film gets its title. That is how long Gabita has been pregnant. Bebe though does not seem like a trust worthy kind of guy. He has something up his sleeve. But he will not be the end of their problems.The film sets itself up as a thriller and believe it or not, it is suspenseful. There are no chase sequences, no cops and robbers, just the suspense that the two girls will get found out and risk prison and worst yet may have physical damage done to them.Though the characters never speak directly about politics, Mungiu and his cinematographer, Oleg Mutu (who also shot ""The Death of Mr. Lazarescu) very in subtle ways tell the viewer about life under Ceausescu. We can sense the paranoia of the times and the government control. ID's are contantly asked for and checked. Streets are empty. Everyone buys supplies from the black market. Even if you are not familiar we the history of Romanian we can see or at least get a sense of what life was like under the times.The film is fully conceived and realized by Mungiu who has directed only one other feature film entitled ""Occident"". Every character is believeable as is their situation. I never questioned whether or not what was on-screen could or could not happen. It is accepted as truth. But the standout performances are given by the girls. Neither has much experience. Marinca has a brief role in Francis Ford Coppola's ""Youth Without Youth"", also set in Romania. And Vasiliu has only acted in one other film, Nicolae Margineau's masterpiece ""Bless You, Prison"". With such little acting experience how on Earth did these girl pull off these roles? They are the heart and soul of the film and deserve every bit of acclaim they get for this movie and more.And the film has been getting acclaim. It was the winner of the Palm d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. It won a prize at the Chicago Film Critics Award and was nominated for a Golden Globe.

1147968,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00151QYE4,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","It's taken a while for me to get comfortable with the idea of writing a review for this film, namely because the film has effected me to such an extreme that it's almost too painful to put into words.  I have always had an emotional reaction to anything dealing with the death and or mistreatment of a child and I am extremely pro-life and highly against the act of abortion, so I knew going into this movie that I was going to be an emotional wreck.  I actually expected to despise to film and or find immense fault with it.I can't do that because there are no faults to be found.`4 Luni, 3 Saptamani si 2 Zile' follows the efforts of two women to secure an illegal abortion in Romania during the 1980's.  Our main focal point is Otilia, roommate to the pregnant Gabriela, as she finds Bebe, the man willing to perform the abortion; and thus begins their very long evening.The film is marvelously shot in a manner that draws you into the lives of these two women.  The camera slowly lags behind, allowing us to follow them as if we were an outsider peering into their world without their knowledge; allowing us to know them from a distance, seeing their true colors and not the faade they throw up in front of the ones they know and love.  The rawness and grittiness of the film carries with it a sense of reality.  What is so painful about `4 Luni, 3 Saptamani si 2 Zile' is that it feels as it this is a home video and this situation is not a fictional movie but real life.  The script is expertly written to come across real and believable.  The dialog is conversational, awkward and sincere.  Director/screenwriter Cristian Mungiu must be singled out and praised for his beautiful and honest handling of this material, for had he mishandled the film in any way it would have lost its presence and depth.The acting is triumphant and really procures this film's brilliance.  Anamaria Marinca is flawless as Otilia.  What I love so much about her performance is that she really made this movie all about her.  She is not the pregnant woman undergoing the strenuous abortion yet Otilia is just as devastatingly effected by the procedure and the outcome and thus we are able to experience what she is experiencing because we too are just an outsider peering in.  As the film progresses we can witness the layers of protection pealing away from Otilia's guard until she is finally exposed in all her rawness as human and deeply conflicted.  Laura Vasiliu is also extremely impressive as Gabriela.  Her panicky mannerisms and paranoid tendencies ring so true for her situation, and like Marinca, Vasiliu allows her characters guard to slowly drop so that we are gradually shown who she really is.  Vlad Ivanov has a small but very crucial part in the film as Bebe.  His performance is uncanny, truly gut-wrenching as we see the selfishness and heartlessness that comes from having a power over weaker ones.  His character is easy to hate but his performance is even easier to adore.With all that said, there is much more to `4 Luni, 3 Saptamani si 2 Zile' than a great script, superb acting and flawless direction.`4 Luni, 3 Saptamani si 2 Zile' is the only film, and I mean only film, that was able to unlock something within me that has been caged for a long time.  I remember literally shaking throughout the duration of the film, my hands clenching my sofa cushions tightly and my skin shivering over my bones.  I remember my breath left me a few times and I had to fight to focus on the screen; my eyes blurred by the sting of tears.  Like I said at the outset of my review, the life of a child is something very near and dear to me.  Being a father (a new father at that) I have very strong opinions on the matter and so this film was very hard for me to watch.  There are many disturbing scenes, not necessarily graphic (although there are some) but disturbing in the sense that what you are witnessing goes against every you have ever truly believed in (that is if you believe as I do); but I think even if you are pro-choice and have no quarrels with the idea of abortion, this film will strike you at your very core.This is the only, and I mean only, film that has ever made me weep.What is so amazing about `4 Luni, 3 Saptamani si 2 Zile' is that by its end you are forced to really sympathize with both sides of the spectrum and that final scene, with Otilia and Gabriela at the table really explains in full the feelings of the audience at that very moment.  As they are obviously thinking `what have we just done' we as the audience are thinking `what did we just witness'.  The film is very neutral which works to its advantage.  This is not a film about pro-choice or pro-life; it is merely a film about a choice made to take a life and the emotional distress it causes the ones involved.  `4 Luni, 3 Saptamani si 2 Zile' bleeds dry with honesty, and honesty that is haunting because it strikes so close to home.I don't know if I'll ever be able to watch `4 Luni, 3 Saptamani si 2 Zile' again.  Like I mentioned, the film made me weep.  I literally finished the film and then walked straight into my daughter's room and curled into the fetal position on her floor and wept.  I felt emotionally drained; empty so-to-speak.  Since seeing this film (about three or four months ago now) I have been able to think of nothing else.  It's because of this that I must admit `4 Luni, 3 Saptamani si 2 Zile' to be one of the greatest films I've ever seen.  No, it was not a desired `experience' but honestly the film is the very definition of what a film should be.  It is a very difficult film to get through and it brings to the table feelings of hate, misery, regret and guilt, but in the end it will leave with you a part of its soul, and only a masterpiece can do something like that.",5,A powerhouse film that will shake you to your core...,1212537600,"06 4, 2008",2008,5793,"['taken', 'while', 'get', 'comfortable', 'idea', 'writing', 'review', 'film',

1147969,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00151QYE4,Andy Orrock,"[3, 4]","We saw ""4 Months..."" shortly after reading David Ansen's scorching and on-target rant in Newsweek that said ""Oscar botches the best foreign films. Again.""Indeed.  This deserving movie garnered a prime list of accolades.  Ansen summarizes it best: ""[It] won the Palme d'Or in Cannes and the European Film Award; it was voted best foreign film by both the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. Not only was it not nominated for an Oscar, it failed to make the shortlist of nine films announced several weeks ago.""  How tone-deaf can you be?The movie is justly deserving of the awards.  College students and roommates Otilia (Anamaria Marinca) and Gabita (Laura Vasiliu) navigate their way though mid-80s Romania - portrayed here vididly and starkly by writer/director Cristian Mungiu as ill-lit, pot-holed, sclerotic, labyrinth and dominated by black markets and backroom dealing.  The lack of a soundtrack adds to the urgency and starkness of the film.  And, contrary to Gabita's waverings on just how far along she is, the title of the film tells you that - quite the opposite - she knows the moment of conception down to the very day.  Her vagueness on this matter is not an unimportant point, so Mungiu's choice of title is a small masterstroke.Best scene: Otilia meeting her boyfriend's parents (and their friends) for the first time...she's just left Gabita alone in a hotel room in a precarious state, so she sits at that dinner table completely preoccupied  and mostly oblivious, nearly jumping out of her skin when the phone rings yet remains unanswered (she's half-expecting a call).  Meanwhile, boyfriend Adi (Alexandru Potocean) sits behind her getting increasingly angry at her lack of interaction (at this point, he has little idea what's going on with Otilia and Gabita).  Mungiu lets the camera run for eight or more minutes easily....the scene seems unscripted, as if the other actors are told to simply provide an unrelated, background dialog.  Sounds prosaic, but in the context of where you are right at that moment in the film, it's thrilling and compelling.  Try to take your eyes off of Ms. Marinca.

While women were not in control of their own bodies while pregnant they also faced the harsh penalty of being jailed if ever caught.

The reason abortion was illegal, and people went to prison for attempting it, is because Ceausescu thought that Romania needed a bigger population because he gathered that a bigger population meant a more powerful state. Therefore, there was no contraception available and people had to make do with what they could.Now, what 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days shows, in a shockingly honest way, is that humanity can endure even the most degrading and inhuman of situations.

It is also about duplicity and betrayal.But most of all it is a warning to all American women.  What these women went through is what all American women face IF abortion is made completely illegal again as the GOP and the Christian Conservative Right wish it to be.  Frankly all anti-choice citizens should be tied down to chairs and be made to watch this film over and over again until they get it.  I worked in clinics and heard horror stories like this.  So here is a spoiler alert.  What this abortionist does to these two women was done here in this country also before abortion was legal and performed in the safety of clinics and hospitals by trained physicians.  What is done to these two women and what was done to women in this country before 1973 when they tried to terminate pregnancies is the exact same thing.  RAPE.  Understand that under American law, and the law of every country in the EU, rape is also defined as sex by coercion.  Not only violence or threat but also coercion.  And RAPE is what happens here as well as a gruesome and hard to watch must less imagine illegal abortion performed by someone untrained in the most unsanitary of conditions.THIS IS WHAT AMERICAN WOMEN FACE IF ROE V. WADE IS OVERTURNED.  Precisely what both these women in this film set in communist Romania endured.  What women in every country endure where abortion is illegal.Anyone who is &#34;fine&#34; with that is rather misguided about what human rights are all about.  I must admit I am angry right now but I am seeing a country I've lived in for 61 years being turned on it's head and the victims of this will be American women.  Not the men.  Just the women.So do watch this film.  It is set in a different time.  But this storyline was a true story in the U.S. when abortion was illegal here and if abortion is made illegal again everywhere, what happened in this film won't be a screenplay or a fictional story but a reality for American women.

Writer/director Cristian Mungiu captures one day in the lives of a few common people in Bucharest, lingering over each of the individuals just long enough to sense the terror of the moment, but continuing to move the pace of the story at a speed that capitalizes on the incidents in life that come just short of stopping the world for the people immediately involved. It is a very tough movie to watch but a uniquely fascinating work of art that deserves plaudits for the bravery of those who created it.Without introduction the viewer is placed in a dormitory in Bucharest where two roommates - Otilia (Anamaria Marinca) and Gabita (Laura Vasiliu) seem preoccupied with an unidentified appointment. Through the rapid progress of the actions of Otilia we learn that Gabita is pregnant and in need of an abortion. Because she is young and single and afraid to make her condition known, Gabita convinces her closest friend Otilia to make all of the arrangements. Otilia finds a hotel room, engages the black market abortionist Bebe (Vlad Ivanov) to meet the two girls that evening in a sleazy hotel to perform the abortion.  Bebe may be shady but he is up front with the girls, explaining that Gabita is too far along for a safe abortion, but with sufficient money he agrees to perform the act (insufficient funds force Otilia to 'pay ' Bebe in a demeaning way). While Gabita awaits the action of the procedure performed, Otilia leaves her for a promised visit to her boyfriend Abi's (Alexandru Potocean)  mother's birthday dinner.  Otilia, distraught at the punishing circumstances of the day, finds it difficult to endure the superficial dialogue of Abi's family and friends and soon escapes the party to return to Gabita at the hotel.  What she discovers severs the remaining traces of friendship bonding so tried by the 'victimized' selfish and arrogant Gabita, and the film ends as strangely as it begins - life simply goes on no matter how brutal the realities are.Mungiu elects to tell his story (based on a true story shared with him by a friend) as a spontaneous moment, abetted by feeling the prolonged shooting takes of the film provide.  The acting is excellent in the manner in which it seems  improvised.  There are many aspect of the film that will make many viewers avert the eyes, but the message is so clear that staying with the film to the end drives home many facts and truths that beg for awareness.

As this memorable story demonstrates, even if a woman makes it through the procedure in acceptable physical condition, all manner of other scars- psychological and emotional- will likely follow her for the rest of her life.  And not only her, but maybe even the people surrounding her.That's essentially what this movie is about: the scars collected during the course of one day, when a young pregnant woman named Gabriela (Laura Vasiliu) and her supportive friend Otilia (Anamaria Marinca) work together to secure a secret abortion in an Eastern European country, circa late 1980's, where abortion is illegal.  The movie plays fair, showing that any abortion- legal or not- isn't a pretty, morally-neutral act (I'm thinking here of the haunting, lingering shot of the aborted fetus on the starkly-lit bathroom floor of the hotel room where the abortion takes place). It also shows, however, that women can be subjected to not only bad hygenic and medical conditions when procuring an illegal abortion, but often horrible, needless brutality from practitioners who might not be worrying about their patients' emotional needs first and foremost.I liked the way the movie always kept its cinematic sensibilities front and center.  Everything is shot with an eye toward establishing and building suspense, mood, character, and whatever else is called for in a given scene.  A particular standout element is a long single-shot sequence near the end of the film (reminiscent of a similarly well-shot scene near the end of ""Children of Men"") where Otilia gets momentarily lost late at night in a shady part of town during her efforts to dispose of the evidence of her friend's abortion before it's discovered by the police.  The shadows and sounds close in on her, and we expect her to be attacked at any moment, though we soon realize that the danger is mostly in her head.  In that scene, the film is really not about abortion at all, but pure cinema, though of course in some ways that sequence is just as much about the abortion as the scenes in the hotel room.Extra features on the crisp, sharp DVD include illuminating interviews with screenwriter/director Cristian Mungiu, and the film's director of photography.

Both of these actresses do a wonderful job, and each of their characters provides an important point of view to the story.To be honest, even outlining the plot is somewhat of a spoiler, even though the story is plastered all over the DVD case and product page.  That is because the film is crafted in such a way that what is happening on the screen sneaks up on you.  While this kind of story could easily be made into a caricature of itself or a political statement, the treatment here is nuanced and powerful.  No film can represent reality 100%, but the filmmaker succeeds in masterfully telling a thought-provoking story in a way that feels real and presents many sides of the situation.This is a film that I had heard about long before I ever got to see it.  Indeed, hype alone is often enough to make people rate a film much more harshly than it deserves.  All one has to do is evaluate the comments regardingJuno (Single-Disc Edition)to understand that when a good film garners attention, many people begin to expect a *perfect* film.  Upon seeing the film, it is easy to feel disappointed.  Each person has their own preconcieved notion of what is good in film.And yet this movie does indeed deserve all of the praise it has been given.  That is not to say that it is perfect, because nothing is perfect.  Nor is it a documentary, but rather one film-makers subjective telling of a story.  That comes with the necessary infusion of personal beliefs that go along with a subjective telling. And yet, from a technical and artistic perspective, this film is still an achievement that deserves the accolades that have been bestowed upon it.The main themes of this movie have been described ad nauseum.  Yet I think, as this film tries to portray one form of reality, just like reality this film can and may have been misunderstood.One of the aspects of this film that has attracted attention is the political and social reality of Ceausescu's communist Romania during the depicted period.  Many medical procedures were against the law and the governement was agressively pursuing a strategy of population growth. While it is impossible not to draw some conclusions about the communist government that is a part of that reality, I would caution those who would simplistically assume this film presents a one-sided political verdict against one type of government.My own personal interpretation of this film is that it depicts some of the good and bad that people under any system are capable of.  Some will make great sacrifices to help others, and some will use the system to take advantage of the defenseless.  This is no different today then it was then.  The differences between countries and laws are significant and worth noting.  But they should not overpower the larger message of this story.Do yourself a favor.  See this movie with an open mind.  Do not view it as a political statement, but rather as the work of art that it is.  Undoubtedly, politics and art do go hand in hand.  But once in a while a film comes along that transcends the limits of a one-sided view and truly does tell a message that includes the multiplicity of the real world.  While one can find fault with any film, this film deserves credit for what it does right.  See it for yourself and make up your own mind.Enjoy.",5,"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days - A Landmark Film",1229558400,"12 18, 2008",2008,3501,"['4', 'Months', '3', 'Weeks', '2', 'Daystells', 'story', 'Gabita', 'played', 'Laura', 'Vasiliu', 'unplanned', 'pregnancy', 'aid', 'college', 'roommate', 'Otilia', 'played', 'Anamaria', 'Marinca', 'actresses', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'characters', 'important', 'point', 'view', 'story.To', 'be', 'honest', 'even', 'outlining', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'spoiler', 'even', 'story', 'plastered', 'DVD', 'case', 'product', 'page', 'film', 'crafted', 'such', 'way', 'what', 'happening', 'screen', 'up', 'kind', 'story', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'made', 'caricature', 'political', 'statement', 'treatment', 'here', 'nuanced', 'powerful', 'film', 'can', 'represent', 'reality', '100', '%', 'filmmaker', 'masterfully', 'telling', 'thought-provoking', 'story', 'way', 'feels', 'real', 'presents', 'many', 'sides', 'situation.This', 'film', 'had', 'heard', 'long', 'ever', 'got', 'see', 'Indeed', 'hype', 'alone', 'often', 'enough', 'make', 'people', 'rate', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'harshly', 'one', 'do', 'evaluate', 'comments', 'regardingJuno', 'Single-Disc', 'Edition', 'understand', 'when', 'good', 'film', 'garners', 'attention', 'many', 'people', 'begin', 'expect', '*perfect*', 'film', 'seeing', 'film', 'easy', 'feel', 'disappointed', 'person', 'own', 'preconcieved', 'notion', 'what', 'good', 'film.And', 'yet', 'movie', 'indeed', 'deserve', 'praise', 'been', 'given', 'not', 'say', 'perfect', 'nothing', 'perfect', 'documentary', 'rather', 'one', 'film-makers', 'subjective', 'telling', 'story', 'necessary', 'infusion', 'personal', 'beliefs', 'go', 'along', 'subjective', 'telling', 'yet', 'technical', 'artistic', 'perspective', 'film', 'still', 'achievement', 'accolades', 'have', 'been', 'bestowed', 'it.The', 'main', 'themes', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'described', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'think', 'film', 'portray', 'one', 'form', 'reality', 'just', 'reality', 'film', 'can', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'misunderstood.One', 'aspects', 'film', 'attracted', 'attention', 'political', 'social', 'reality', 'Ceausescu', 'communist', 'Romania', 'depicted', 'period', 'Many', 'medical', 'procedures', 'were', 'law', 'governement', 'was', 'agressively', 'pursuing', 'strategy', 'population', 'growth', 'impossible', 'not', 'draw', 'conclusions', 'communist', 'government', 'part', 'reality', 'would', 'caution', 'who', 'would', 'simplistically', 'assume', 'film', 'one-sided', 'political', 'verdict', 'one', 'type', 'government.My', 'own', 'personal', 'interpretation', 'film', 'good', 'bad', 'people', 'system', 'are', 'capable', 'will', 'make', 'great', 'sacrifices', 'help', 'others', 'will', 'use', 'system', 'take', 'advantage', 'defenseless', 'different', 'today', 'then', 'was', 'then', 'differences', 'countries', 'laws', 'are', 'significant', 'worth', 'noting', 'should', 'not', 'overpower', 'larger', 'message', 'story.Do', 'favor', 'See', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'Do', 'not', 'view', 'political', 'statement', 'rather', 'work', 'art', 'Undoubtedly', 'politics', 'art', 'do', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'once', 'while', 'film', 'limits', 'one-sided', 'view', 'truly', 'tell', 'message', 'multiplicity', 'real', 'world', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'fault', 'film', 'film', 'credit', 'what', 'right', 'See', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind.Enjoy']","4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days"

Her college room mate, Otilia (Anamaria Marinca) is beyond reason more than concerned and ready to help her friend. And help her friend she does: driving her to the hotel, securing the money to pay for and doing just about anything she can do to help her friend terminate an unwanted pregnancy. But what are Otilia's real motives? Is she so against Ceausescu's policy of population enrichment that she would risk her personal safety, break the law of the land, is she in love with Gabita and thus willing to do anything to make her happy or is she merely pro-abortion? It really is never quite clear though the details of director Cristian Mungiu's film are fascinating to watch as this world is as foreign to most Westerners as the world of ""Star Wars"" or ""Alien.""The dramatic propulsion here is one of, not only what is going to happen next but one of what is this world, what is this time, what are the principles of life and day-to-day living that we are watching here? Why is Otilia so dedicated to Gabita who proves to be a cipher: young, dumb, silly, unaware...yet there is that nagging feeling that Gabita brings Otilia along  for some other reason having to do with the abortionist: the evil, smarmy Mr. Bebe (Vlad Ivanov), who is obviously out for something more than the money.""4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days"" is a puzzle: a puzzle that has no definite resolution.

Rarely are characters drawn with such individualized, understated, and credible dialogue.  The setting of communist-crumbled Romania is fully accomplished from the start.  Concise scenes are fluidly connected together with continuous, yet not labored, camera shots.  The casting is superb - I found all the characters to be incredibly believable and engrossing.  I also thought the acting was compelling and flawless.So that you don't think I'm a ""I like everything"" critic - I found the frequent use of handheld camera shots (instead of tripoded) to be unnecessarily distracting, and I didn't think it added any particularly positive or stylistic ambiance.  If it was done primarily because of budget restraints, I can fully respect the choice, but otherwise I would have taken the distracting ""person holding the camera"" out of the regular viewing equation.This movie is incredibly difficult to watch, whether you are a woman or a man.  But everyone should strongly consider watching it, especially men - to understand more of the horrific realities women must face in these circumstances.While watching this film on dvd, I could not handle the stress continuously, so I took regular breaks to compile my thoughts and calm my senses.Spoiler alert:At one point in the film, the man willing to perform the abortion requests more money for his services than the women have.  Faced with the option of not being able to get an abortion, the non-pregnant friend and the pregnant woman both silently and implicitly agree to have sex with the man (separately and individually) to ""pay"" the difference in payment before he performs the abortion.  The conscientous filmmakers intentionally do not show the sex-for-payment scenes, but clearly imply the sex scenes off-camera, showing each woman sitting outside the room as the other woman has sex with the man, then showing each woman walk quickly to the bathroom immediately after - to wash themselves in an attempt to mitigate the effects of what they have each just done.~ end of spoiler ~The settings, hair & make-up, and clothing are fitting for the subject matter and never distracting to the important stories being told.This film is Not Rated, but if it had received a rating for broad release in the U.S., it would likely have received an NC-17 rating.  It is an example of an excellent ""NC-17"" film.Roger Ebert gave the film 4 out of 4 stars.  The film won the 2007 Cannes Film Festivalfs highest honor, the Palme d'Or.  The film was The New York Times' Film Critic's, Steven Holden's, top film on his list of Top Ten films for 2008.This film is a story that most of us can watch with some sense of detachment - we sit in a dark room and watch horrific things happen to other people.  It's important to remember that for many women in many parts of the world, these kinds of circumstances still exist (or worse), and their memories are not vicarious.  These kinds of memories they must live and deal with for the rest of their lives.May you never live in a country where you are put into Gabita's circumstances.  May you never ask a friend to do what Gabita asks her friend Otilia to do for her.  May you never live in a country that forces women to choose from the untenable choices Gabita and her friend Otilia have available to them.  But know there are many women who, out of love and caring, have done all the things Otilia did for her girl friend Gabita, and would do them again for their girl friends if laws did not allow for medically licensed abortions.  It's everyone's responsibility to make sure laws, in each of our countries, do not force women into these kinds of choices.",5,"An Honest Story About Women Living In Romania, Where Abortion Was Illegal",1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,3906,"['movie', 'female', 'friend', 'helping', 'pregnant', 'girl', 'friend', 'slowly', 'live', 'one', 'day', 'realities', 'getting', 'illegal', 'abortion', 'black', 'market', 'non-medically-trained', 'man', '1987', 'Romania.This', 'movie', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'incredibly', 'well', 'Rarely', 'are', 'characters', 'drawn', 'such', 'individualized', 'understated', 'credible', 'dialogue', 'setting', 'communist-crumbled', 'Romania', 'fully', 'accomplished', 'start', 'Concise', 'scenes', 'are', 'fluidly', 'connected', 'together', 'continuous', 'yet', 'not', 'labored', 'camera', 'shots', 'casting', 'superb', 'found', 'characters', 'be', 'incredibly', 'believable', 'engrossing', 'also', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'compelling', 'flawless.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'like', 'everything', 'critic', 'found', 'frequent', 'use', 'handheld', 'camera', 'shots', 'instead', 'tripoded', 'be', 'unnecessarily', 'distracting', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'added', 'particularly', 'positive', 'stylistic', 'ambiance', 'was', 'done', 'primarily', 'budget', 'restraints', 'can', 'fully', 'respect', 'choice', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'distracting', 'person', 'holding', 'camera', 'regular', 'viewing', 'equation.This', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'watch', 'are', 'woman', 'man', 'everyone', 'should', 'strongly', 'consider', 'watching', 'especially', 'men', 'understand', 'more', 'horrific', 'realities', 'women', 'must', 'face', 'circumstances.While', 'watching', 'film', 'dvd', 'could', 'not', 'handle', 'stress', 'continuously', 'took', 'regular', 'breaks', 'compile', 'thoughts', 'calm', 'senses.Spoiler', 'alert', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'man', 'willing', 'perform', 'abortion', 'more', 'money', 'services', 'women', 'have', 'Faced', 'option', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'abortion', 'non-pregnant', 'friend', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'silently', 'implicitly', 'agree', 'have', 'sex', 'man', 'separately', 'individually', 'pay', 'difference', 'payment', 'abortion', 'conscientous', 'filmmakers', 'intentionally', 'do', 'not', 'show', 'sex-for-payment', 'scenes', 'clearly', 'imply', 'sex', 'off-camera', 'showing', 'woman', 'sitting', 'room', 'other', 'woman', 'sex', 'man', 'then', 'showing', 'woman', 'walk', 'quickly', 'bathroom', 'immediately', 'wash', 'attempt', 'mitigate', 'effects', 'what', 'have', 'just', 'done.~', 'end', 'spoiler', '~The', 'settings', 'hair', 'make-up', 'clothing', 'are', 'fitting', 'subject', 'matter', 'never', 'distracting', 'important', 'stories', 'being', 'told.This', 'film', 'Not', 'Rated', 'had', 'received', 'rating', 'broad', 'release', 'U.S.', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'received', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'example', 'excellent', 'NC-17', 'film.Roger', 'Ebert', 'gave', 'film', '4', '4', 'stars', 'film', 'won', '2007', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festivalfs', 'highest', 'honor', 'Palme', ""d'Or"", 'film', 'was', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'Film', 'Critic', 'Steven', 'Holden', 'top', 'film', 'list', 'Top', 'Ten', 'films', '2008.This', 'film', 'story', 'most', 'can', 'watch', 'sense', 'detachment', 'sit', 'dark', 'room', 'watch', 'horrific', 'things', 'happen', 'other', 'people', 'important', 'remember', 'many', 'women', 'many', 'parts', 'world', 'kinds', 'circumstances', 'still', 'exist', 'worse', 'memories', 'are', 'not', 'vicarious', 'kinds', 'memories', 'must', 'live', 'deal', 'rest', 'lives.May', 'never', 'live', 'country', 'where', 'are', 'put', 'Gabita', 'circumstances', 'May', 'never', 'ask', 'friend', 'do', 'what', 'Gabita', 'friend', 'Otilia', 'do', 'May', 'never', 'live', 'country', 'women', 'choose', 'untenable', 'choices', 'Gabita', 'friend', 'Otilia', 'have', 'available', 'know', 'are', 'many', 'women', 'who', 'love', 'caring', 'have', 'done', 'things', 'Otilia', 'did', 'girl', 'friend', 'Gabita', 'would', 'do', 'again', 'girl', 'friends', 'laws', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'medically', 'licensed', 'abortions', 'everyone', 'responsibility', 'make', 'sure', 'laws', 'countries', 'do', 'not', 'force', 'women', 'kinds', 'choices']","4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days"

I think that one of the ""advantages"" of modern movies is that they eliminate the need to think in the audience, it becomes an exercise in detachment to see a number of explosions and violent acts that are really (for the most part) removed from our everyday experience; we can become fascinated by the bright colors and loud noises in the comfort of the theater, akin to a child discovering a bright and big world that they are in effect naive of and protected from (by the mother, as we are by the two-dimensionality of it).  In films like this, which slow the pace down and familiarize the content, we are much more viscerally affected, because it becomes an exercise in human experience, something that very well could affect us, and the slowness of it forces us to pay attention to details, mundane details perhaps, that we would just assume gloss over and move on to the next explosion.  But directors like this make us listen and watch that which is much closer to the heart of the human condition, something that we all-too-often lose sight of in a frenetic and results-driven world.  I think a beautiful analogy to this situation occurs in the dinner scene, in which the chatter fills the room, a chatter devoid of any content that actually reaches the girl, who sits in a dazed and detached manner, while her boyfriend vacillates between the two realities, one foot in each, but in truth you cannot split your fidelity between the pain of thought and life in their most primordial forms, or the detachment and illusion of a life lived on the surface... his choice is ultimately understandable, as it would have been if it had gone the other way.  The scene towards the end is a microcosm of the search of how to undo steps, the paranoia of stepping outside of the box, running down the dark and threatening alleyways of existence, seeking how to rid ourselves of that which we would rather not be a part of us, yet realizing ultimately how fruitless this venture is, and once we're in contact with that part of ourselves, things can never go back to being what they were before (as the final scene between the two women demonstrates powerfully).

1148017,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00151QYE4,Randy Keehn,"[0, 1]","I was drawn to ""4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days"" because I noticed that it is a Romanian film and I had never seen a Romanian film or, excluding ""Dracula"", even a film about Romania.  My interest to explore other countries has lead to encountering some excellent movies (looking for Macedonia and discovering ""Before the Rain"" is about as good an example as I can give).  ""4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days"" was a lot more than I bargained for and, in the days since I watched it, the movie has continued to haunt me.The movie begins with two women preparing for a journey and, frankly, there is a bit of mystery behind that since since we are given no clear indication of what the trip is about.  I might be spoiling the film for some although I was pretty sure what the journey was about before it was positively revealed.  The reason to mention it in a review such as this is that the subject matter was, to say the least, controversial; abortion.  Abortion, as the film clearly stated, is highly illegal in Romania (which might explain the international interest in Romanian babies available for adoption a few years back).  This film is about a back street abortion and it is quite disturbing.  The way the director and actors worked together to create a sense of dismal reality works to a rather depressing level of excellence.  Everyone is is taut for various reasons and the differing interests, relationships, and personalities take reality well beyond the usual theatrical standards.  So much happens in one day that the film's title seems to say that life's measurement of time is relative to the to the intensity it creates and receives.  Others might suggest that the film's title shows the limits of the life that is left to others to approve or disapprove.  Personally, I am against abortion and I was challenged to experience the process in ""4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days"".  I initially thought the film was meant to be a statement about the dangers of back alley abortions (and the case is fairly well made).  However, there were suggestions of the life that already was and I began to see a balance.  I believe that the balance was intential so that the intended purpose of the movie could be realized.  This is a ""day in the life"" film and a story about how one person's issues affects others in ways that can't be forseen.  It is also a very interesting look at urban life in Romania.

Film is set in Romania where many things are scarce: cigarettes, tic-tac, soap, cosmetics and yes - doctors that can perform abortion since the abortion over there is illegal.  One has to understand a little bit of the culture of that part of the world to truly understand the value of the film.  Young women are left to their own device when their boyfriends make them pregnant.  It is kind of world were boys have no responsibility - financial or otherwise once girl finds herself pregnant.  It was also kind of world were contraceptives are either scarce or not available, single motherhood is socially unacceptable and orphanages are places where innocents are punished for the ""sins"" of their (often underage) parents.  Two roommates, young girls from small places in Romanian provinces are forced to make hurried arrangement for one of them to have an abortion.  The entire operation must be kept secret and everyone involved must be bribed in one way or another.  To make matters worse, this is advanced pregnancy and the risks are great.  One can loose life during the procedure, or spend several years in prison if discovered in this illegal activity.  One does not have to be a woman to find this story frightening.  And the story itself is not only about unwanted pregnancy.  It is about unprotected sex, vulnerability of the women, supression of the women, shallowness of the so-called intellectuals.  Young people's parents are more worried about them smoking than being sexually active; bringing someone flowers for her 48th birthday is more important than helping another person after inhumanely performed abortion.

1148020,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00151QYE4,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","****1/2As any lover of international cinema can tell you, the Romanian film industry has been undergoing something of a mini Renaissance over the past several years - and no film exemplifies that phenomenon quite as well as ""4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days,"" an utterly absorbing and fascinating work that is, above all, a triumph of movie naturalism.  Like the Czechs, Hungarians and Iranians who came before them, the Romanians specialize in fashioning works of art out of the simplest details of everyday life.Its story could not be any more basic and straightforward, focusing on two young college women and their efforts to obtain an illegal abortion under the Communist rule of Nikolai Ceausescu (the movie is set in 1987).  Gabita is the frightened girl who is farther along in her pregnancy than she has led anyone, even the abortionist himself, to believe.  That also includes her roommate, Otilia, who has taken on the task of seeing her friend through this time of crisis.  That's pretty much the entire plot in a nutshell, but what writer/director Cristian Mungru has been able to fashion out of this premise is awe-inspiring in its simplicity and power.  Much of the movie is spent observing, in the minutest detail imaginable, the step-by-step process they must go through in order to attain their goal.  The movie shuns the hot-button political nature of its subject matter to concentrate on the human aspects instead.  Mungru brings an almost documentary-style realism to the film, allowing the scenes to develop in near-real time fashion, while the actors play their roles to perfection.Laura Vasiliu brings a haunting, almost waiflike fragility to the role of Gabita, while Vlad Ivanov is utterly bone-chilling as the heartless abortionist who is not above exploiting these frightened, confused and desperate women in the basest ways possible to get what he wants.  But it is Anamaria Marinca as Otilia, who turns in an award-worthy performance.  She manages to create an utterly convincing, fully fleshed-out character without employing a single noticeable actor's trick in the process.  She grabs our attention from the outset and never allows us to turn our attention away from her for a single moment she is on screen (which is most of the time).Like all great art that draws its strength from a controversial theme, ""4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days"" never finds it necessary to preach to its audience; instead, it shines an objective light on its subject, then lets each individual viewer search his own conscience and come to his own conclusion on the topic.  Yet, this is much more than simply a film about abortion.  It is an exploration of the nature of relationships and about just how far one must be willing to go in the cause of friendship.  Moreover, the roller coaster ride of emotions - fear, hesitancy, confusion, anger, shame, guilt - that these two women go through in the course of the film is brought to vivid life both by the actors and those working on the other side of the camera.  The choices these women have to make throughout are difficult and heartbreaking in the extreme, especially for Otilia who has to decide just how much she is willing to risk, endure and sacrifice for the sake of her friend.The movie deflates a bit in the final third thanks to an overlong dinner party sequence that attenuates some of the tension the movie has so masterfully built up until that point, but nothing can keep ""4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days"" from being one of the best movies of recent times.",4,unforgettable human drama,1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,3523,"['****1/2As', 'lover', 'international', 'cinema', 'can', 'tell', 'Romanian', 'film', 'industry', 'been', 'undergoing', 'something', 'mini', 'Renaissance', 'past', 'several', 'years', 'film', 'phenomenon', 'quite', 'as', 'well', '4', 'Months', '3', 'Weeks', '2', 'Days', 'utterly', 'absorbing', 'fascinating', 'work', 'triumph', 'movie', 'naturalism', 'Czechs', 'Hungarians', 'Iranians', 'who', 'came', 'Romanians', 'specialize', 'fashioning', 'works', 'art', 'simplest', 'details', 'everyday', 'life.Its', 'story', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'basic', 'straightforward', 'focusing', 'two', 'young', 'college', 'women', 'efforts', 'obtain', 'illegal', 'abortion', 'Communist', 'rule', 'Nikolai', 'Ceausescu', 'movie', 'set', '1987', 'Gabita', 'frightened', 'girl', 'who', 'farther', 'along', 'pregnancy', 'led', 'anyone', 'even', 'abortionist', 'believe', 'also', 'roommate', 'Otilia', 'who', 'taken', 'task', 'seeing', 'friend', 'time', 'crisis', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'plot', 'nutshell', 'what', 'writer/director', 'Cristian', 'Mungru', 'been', 'able', 'fashion', 'premise', 'awe-inspiring', 'simplicity', 'power', 'Much', 'movie', 'spent', 'observing', 'minutest', 'detail', 'imaginable', 'step-by-step', 'process', 'must', 'go', 'order', 'attain', 'goal', 'movie', 'hot-button', 'political', 'nature', 'subject', 'matter', 'concentrate', 'human', 'aspects', 'instead', 'Mungru', 'almost', 'documentary-style', 'realism', 'film', 'allowing', 'scenes', 'develop', 'near-real', 'time', 'fashion', 'actors', 'play', 'roles', 'perfection.Laura', 'Vasiliu', 'haunting', 'almost', 'waiflike', 'fragility', 'role', 'Gabita', 'Vlad', 'Ivanov', 'utterly', 'bone-chilling', 'heartless', 'abortionist', 'who', 'not', 'exploiting', 'frightened', 'confused', 'desperate', 'women', 'basest', 'ways', 'possible', 'get', 'what', 'Anamaria', 'Marinca', 'Otilia', 'who', 'award-worthy', 'performance', 'create', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'fully', 'fleshed-out', 'character', 'employing', 'single', 'noticeable', 'actor', 'trick', 'process', 'grabs', 'attention', 'outset', 'never', 'turn', 'attention', 'away', 'single', 'moment', 'screen', 'most', 'time', 'great', 'art', 'strength', 'controversial', 'theme', '4', 'Months', '3', 'Weeks', '2', 'Days', 'never', 'necessary', 'preach', 'audience', 'instead', 'objective', 'light', 'subject', 'then', 'individual', 'viewer', 'search', 'own', 'conscience', 'come', 'own', 'conclusion', 'topic', 'much', 'more', 'simply', 'film', 'abortion', 'exploration', 'nature', 'relationships', 'about', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'willing', 'go', 'cause', 'friendship', 'Moreover', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'emotions', 'fear', 'hesitancy', 'confusion', 'anger', 'shame', 'guilt', 'two', 'women', 'go', 'course', 'film', 'brought', 'vivid', 'life', 'actors', 'working', 'other', 'side', 'camera', 'choices', 'women', 'have', 'make', 'are', 'difficult', 'heartbreaking', 'extreme', 'especially', 'Otilia', 'who', 'decide', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'willing', 'risk', 'endure', 'sacrifice', 'sake', 'friend.The', 'movie', 'bit', 'final', 'third', 'thanks', 'overlong', 'dinner', 'party', 'sequence', 'tension', 'movie', 'so', 'masterfully', 'built', 'up', 'point', 'nothing', 'can', 'keep', '4', 'Months', '3', 'Weeks', '2', 'Days', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'recent', 'times']","4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days"

Depressed and terrified, she relies on friend Otilia (Anamaria Marinca) to book a hotel room, meet an abortionist, and come up with the necessary money.Director Cristian Mungiu presents this sad tale in almost documentary fashion.  There is no glamor lighting, no cinematic tricks, no artificial moments, not even music to suggest mood.  It is a stark movie that reveals the raw emotion of the two young women racing against time as they navigate the horrors of police state rigidity, negotiate with an abortionist with far greater bargaining leverage than theirs, and risk imprisonment.Often movies about abortion polarize audiences:  Pro-lifers will abhor them, pro-choicers will applaud them.  With ""4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days,"" this isn't the case.  It doesn't preach either way.  The focus is on the plight of the two women, particularly Otilia, after they've made a reluctant decision.  Their experience hardly ends with rose petals and champagne.  They have gone through danger and dehumanization.When it comes to screen villains, seldom has there been one as creepy and scary as Mr. Bebe (Vlad Ivanov), the abortionist.  When he first meets with the girls, director Mungiu presents a lengthy, fairly low-key scene that sends chills through the viewer as Bebe calmly reprimands them for not following his instructions exactly as he outlined.  He is like a schoolmaster scolding his students for breaches of classroom protocol.  Oddly, there is also a paternal tone to his admonitions.  He doesn't shout or threaten.  He simply, methodically goes over the instructions he has given, makes sure the girls understood them, and then enumerates how they have veered from his prescribed directions.  He is risking his freedom, he states, and the girls' departure from instructions imperils him.The scene builds as he and Gabita and Otilia discuss money, the procedure itself, what Gabita will experience, and even disposal of the fetus.  By cutting frequently to close-ups of Otilia and Gabita, Mungiu underscores their terror and disgust at the events Bebe discusses so matter-of-factly.We stay with Otilia as we meet her boyfriend Adi (Alex Potocean) and his family at a birthday celebration for his mother.  Because this occurs the same day as the planned abortion, Otilia wants to pass, but after petulant pleas from Adi, she agrees to stop over briefly.  In a scene played in one shot, we see Otilia surrounded by Adi and his well-to-do, professional family members at the dinner table and we hear dinnertime conversation that condescends to working people -- people like Otilia.

1148025,AA8OP79Z9GMQL,B00151QYE4,Tudval,"[16, 53]","Mr. Mungiu obviously believes in tears, even though Bucharest, like its big brother from the east, did not. But everyone is entitled to an opinion, or at least as long as the intention is not malicious. But herein lies the problem. His overuse of dramatic lincence to achieve the highest impact is highly suspect.It's sad that people form an opinion about a country and an era based on a fictional 'work of art'. I would be first to admit, this is still preferable than forming an opinion based on Fox News clips, but still...It wouldn't be much of a problem if Romania, it's culture and history would be widely known. As it is, this movie had an impact far beyond the normal audience and it reached people who have no direct knowledge of these things and may be quite gullible. In communist Romania, all we were shown of American culture were great depression movies, John Waybe and mindless musicals. Now, what we see about Romania is the Numa Numa song and.. this.Many situations, dialogues, decors in the movie are exaggerated for artistic effect. The entire premise is illogical. This would be OK; after all it's not a documentary. But I couldn't help not to notice all the inconsistencies, which present themselves in every scene. I will just list a few, from memory, but there are many more. Before I proceed, I just want to share my opinion that it's inconceivable that this movie has been awarded the Palme d'Or with all the shortcomings. It just serves to further discredit this award. Furthermore, it is inconcievable that the French government would show this movie in schools. Of course, when your people are rioting in the streets asking for justice, it may serve a purpose to show them what an alternative social order would be like (yeeeaaahhh, scary them with a little communism!).So, here's my (incomplete) list, in no particular order:No doctor would risk prison to get 'payment in nature'. It's just absurd. I have heard of such a case when it was asked for, in addition to money, but it was a one on one situation, no witnesses. And I know of many, many cases, where nothing else, other than money was required to perform the procedure. It just doesn't make sense to ask for such a thing when there can be corroborative testimony. Or maybe going to prison for 10 years is not bad enough, so you might just as well go for 20?The doctor risks impregnating the (still) unimpregnated woman. Was he looking to have a new client down-the road?The procedure that is performed is also quite suspect and puts the patient at great risk. A doctor would likely chose a different procedure (which was widely used at the time), where he would provoke a 'spontaneous' abortion, and then the patient would have to go to a hospital to have a proper surgical procedure.When the girls make reservation at a hotel where the doctor was required to show his ID, he goes on and takes the risk, rather than just turning back and requiring that reservation at the proper hotel be made. Absurd!He does not turn around and run, as one might expect, even when he finds out the pregnancy is so advanced that he could be charged with murder! If this would be a Eugen Ionescu's play, we'd know to expect the most absurd situations. But, since it all takes place in the Evil Empire of Communism, the audience goes ahead and believes anything.No woman (not to mentions that she was 'in love'!) would sacrifice her virtue to save a friend from... what? Having a baby????We witness a gathering of professionals (doctors) in a small apartment. Even the lowliest of labourers would have better accommodation. The dialogue is also stupid and bland 'for effect' . Rest assured, nobody would talk like this, especially at a celebration party.The decors show abject misery, but you should ask yourself the question: shouldn't two students take a bit of care of their apartment, no matter how poor they were? Sure they would and most were. One could not find american cigarettes in Romania, but cleaning supplies and paint was still available!!We see despicable attitudes from all, except the two girls. How likely is that? What society produced these soft spoken, well mannered girls if everywhere the movie takes you, all you see is filth: the policemen, the hotel personnel, etc... You should know, even in communist Romania a policeman drinking on the job would risk severe penalties.One of the girls is riding the bus and does not have a ticket and takes one from a stranger. We used to try this trick when we were students, but always made sure we had a ticked in our pocket that we could punch if the controller showed up. Hoping that a stranger would help you... well what happened to the people in previous scenes. I thought everything and everyone was rotten... hmmm... maybe just the movie. This shows that the director really does not want to pay attention to detail, for the want of a cheap effect.OK, I could continue, but I hope that by now you get the idea..P.S. I want to add a note in regard to the state of disrepair of many buildings shown in this movie... don't forget, this movie was filmed 20 years after the fall of the E.E.C. (Evil Empire of Communism). In the '70's, most of them were new and not all that bad. In the 00's, it is of course all that much easier to create a negative image, especially since they have not been maintained at all in the new era of democratic freedom (consider just the fact that 2

The two girls, unfortunately, are completely naive as to what will be involved.  As a result, they make several key blunders that threaten not just whether the abortion will succeed but their psychological well-being too.""4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days"" focuses on the dangers of the illegal abortion, but the film also illustrates in small and large ways the oppressiveness of living in Communist Romania.  The girls have to show their ID cards every time they go to their hotel room, they have to buy most items on the black market, and the police and other authoritarian figures seem to be a constant presence.  ""4 Months"" received stellar reviews when released, but I avoided it initially, fearing that it would be preachy or heavy-handed.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  Although the film is a drama, it often plays as a tense thriller.  The abortion may kill Gabita, but it's just one threat she and Otilia face.The movie was filmed on hand-held digital cameras, which adds an immediacy and urgency.  At times, the camerawork is blurry, particularly a night scene with Otilia, but that just adds to the realism of the story.  ""4 Months"" is the kind of film that actually benefits from its small budget and primitive camera work, and I look forward to seeing more work from director Cristian Mungiu in the future.  The acting is also naturalistic, which again adds realism to the story.  Anamaria Marinca is excellent - we can feel her growing weariness and frustration just by reading her face and tone of voice (which is sometimes difficult to do with a foreign language film).  Vlad Ivanov turns in a fascinating performance as the creepy abortionist; he's one of the more menacing yet controlled characters I've seen on the screen.  It all adds up to a heart-breaking portrait of what can happen in totalitarian societies where everything has its price.The film was nominated for numerous ""foreign film"" prizes, including the Golden Globe.  The Oscars overlooked the movie, even though it was Romania's official selection; I'm not sure why it failed to earn a nomination.

Cristian Mungiu has delivered a masterpiece, a film so powerful it will leave scars with the viewer long after watching it.  The material is raw, filmed beautifully to capture the raw feelings and emotions of the characters, the ugly and drab feel of a communist country and the ever present authoritarian hand of the state.  Some of the scenes are unnerving, especially the hotel scene when Gabita and Otilia are ""negotiating"" with the man who will perform the abortion.  In any society, the choice to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is not one that is positive or cause for happiness.  The reality of facing this reality in the society that Mungiu brings to life is even more dispiriting.  There are no good choices for Gabita and Otilia and one cannot begin to imagine the mental wounds that they will be left with for the rest of their lives.The craftmanship of this film is most evident during two parts of the film.  The first is when Otilia is visiting her boyfriend Adi's parents apartment to celebrate his mother's birthday.  The scenes in the apartment are stunning in how they are shot, especially the bulk of the dining room scene -- shot from one angle, the expressiveness of Otilia, her anguish at having to put up with this family, their celebration and them and their friends sarcastic denigration of her is about as good as movies get.  Additionally, the scenes where Otilia is roaming the streets of the city looking for a place to dispose of the fetus is riveting and terrifying -- most horror films should take a lesson from Mungiu.  We keep expecting something even worse to befall Otilia, as if disposing of her friend and roommate's dead fetus isn't bad enough.  Nothing bad happens but the eerie darkness, haunting sounds and frigid weather left me on the edge of my seat.  This part of the picture for me was a metaphor for the evil big brother authoritarian state chasing Otilia and her friend Gabita no matter how hard they'll try to run from it.This is a movie that is too important not to watch.
