670112,A1LACH6MLQWZ,B00005NTN3,Doug Erlandson,"[1, 1]","If you're not expecting a profound existential message, this is a decent movie to watch. The plot can be summarized in a few sentences. Adam (played by Stuart Townsend) meets Kate Hudson's character, who is the youngest of three sisters, in a pub. He quickly charms her and before long they're in bed together. But it doesn't stop there. When Adam meets the family, he quickly seduces the middle sister and eventually the oldest. Even the brother of the three sisters is attracted to him.What makes this movie a bit unusual is that it is told from the perspective of the three sisters in turn, beginning with the youngest and proceeding to the oldest. At first this is just a bit confusing (at least it was to me), since various scenes are replayed two or three times. But we quickly catch on to the fact that we are seeing this through the eyes of each of the sisters in turn. The crucial scene in all this is the one in which Adam agrees to marry the youngest sister, doing so in public (again in the pub) and in the presence of the other two sisters.If you can get past the rather slow start (my wife and I almost bailed out after fifteen minutes), the movie begins to pick up and becomes funny and enjoyable to watch. And if you can get over the fact that Adam, while having charm, seemingly has no truly redeeming moral characteristics, and that the ending is somewhat unrealistic, it's a movie worth watching once.",4,Decent lighthearted comedy with an interesting twist,1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,1420,"[""'re"", 'not', 'expecting', 'profound', 'existential', 'message', 'decent', 'movie', 'watch', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'summarized', 'few', 'sentences', 'Adam', 'played', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'character', 'who', 'youngest', 'three', 'sisters', 'pub', 'quickly', 'long', ""'re"", 'bed', 'together', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'When', 'Adam', 'family', 'quickly', 'middle', 'sister', 'eventually', 'oldest', 'Even', 'brother', 'three', 'sisters', 'attracted', 'him.What', 'movie', 'bit', 'unusual', 'told', 'perspective', 'three', 'sisters', 'turn', 'beginning', 'youngest', 'proceeding', 'oldest', 'first', 'just', 'bit', 'confusing', 'least', 'was', 'various', 'scenes', 'are', 'replayed', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'quickly', 'catch', 'fact', 'are', 'seeing', 'eyes', 'sisters', 'turn', 'crucial', 'scene', 'one', 'Adam', 'marry', 'youngest', 'sister', 'doing', 'so', 'public', 'again', 'pub', 'presence', 'other', 'two', 'can', 'get', 'rather', 'slow', 'start', 'wife', 'almost', 'bailed', 'out', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'movie', 'pick', 'up', 'becomes', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'can', 'get', 'fact', 'Adam', 'having', 'charm', 'seemingly', 'truly', 'redeeming', 'moral', 'characteristics', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'unrealistic', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'once']",About Adam

And it is almost identical with the film tag-line ""He came. He saw. He conquered. One sister at a time."" Gerard Stembridge's film belongs to the long suffered and rarely done well genre of romantic comedy or so called chick flick but this movie was a nice surprise. It has a twist to it, is amusing, enjoyable and funny, at least up until the very final. In the end, the writer/director seemed to have lost an interest of simply did not know what to do with his main character who could've been a lighter version or a younger brother to Pasolini's mysterious visitor in Theorem or, if asked Who are you, he could've answered, Just your average, horny little devil, not unlike Mr. Darryl van Horn. Yes, About Adam may not use any original ideas and it brings to mind immediately the movies as different as Theorem; Sliding Doors; He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not; the Spanish Oscar winner for the Best Foreign movie, Bell &Eacute;poque, The Witches of Eastwick, and more than one Woody Allen's dramedies, Hannah and Her Sisters, particularly. The story of a charming mysterious man who makes every member of one family fall hard for him simply by being there and expressing the interest to each person's problems, troubles, and needs has been told many times but I personally was amused and smiled more than once while watching this little comedy and I found it if not a bright lost gem but a nice way to spend an hour and half following the adventures of a nice guy , every girl's dream come true who could make women happy because he knew exactly what each of them wanted, needed, longed for, lacked in her life, and dreamed about. I found especially funny always changing and adjusted for a particular listener the story of the powerful sexy mysterious collectible Jaguar, the perfect car for a sexy, mysterious, perfect man. Cinematically, the movie that takes place in Dublin is very pleasant, and I did not mind the repeating narrative that helped to look at the same scenes from very different perspectives and unexpected points of view.

One way, and only one : share and share and share again,  and then love and love and love again, in three words  share your love .

It's a comedy but it is not at all hilarious, just comfortable, cosy and even kind of quaint, quaint like in Boccaccio or Chaucer. The best part of this film is that it is absolutely and deeply sexy and yet you will not see one breast, you will not even see the shape of any sexual attribute, you will hardly see any skin, and yet you will be moved in the deepest depth of your sensual excitement and excitation, in one word you will irresistibly desire and want and wish to meet that Adam and have a conversation with him, no matter what, and let fate and destiny and predestination decide whatever may happen later on. Be sure you will be absolutely flawless afterward because all that will feel, taste and sound absolutely pure, virginal and pristinely chaste, even and especially if it is nothing but exactly the reverse, in your mind, in your bed, or his, and even in your lingerie, or shall we say skin-clothing.

670127,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00005NTN3,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","'About Adam' is billed as a comedy but it's safer to classify it as a farce. It's set in Dublin and it focuses on a family of three sisters and one brother who all become besotted with Adam, a charming Lothario, who insinuates himself into their lives. Unlike most American films where men end up chasing a beautiful woman, 'About Adam' turns the tables and we're treated to the farcical machinations of women who can no longer control their passions when attracted to that one special 'mysterious' man.'About Adam' has a Rashomon-like plot where the story is told from the successive points of view of each sibling. We start off from Lucy's point of view (Kate Hudson) who meets Adam at her place of employment (where she works as a waitress/singer). Lucy is looking for a man who will sweep her off her feet. I'm not sure how Adam manages to press all the right buttons of these women, but they all become besotted with him. The initial seduction of Lucy goes on for way too long and after awhile her obsession with him becomes tiresome (the first 30 minutes is the weakest part of the film).After about half an hour into the film, conflict finally emerges. Soon after meeting Lucy, Adam decides to seduce Lucy's sister, Laura (Frances O'Connor). Laura is more intellectual than Lucy, studying for her PhD in poetry. And of course Adam is familiar with the very obscure poetry Lucy has been studying at school and recites it to her, pressing her buttons. Before you know it, Laura is stripping off HER clothes for him! Adam isn't finished. Brother David finds himself attracted to Adam and fantasizes having a bi-sexual affair with him. He doesn't actually act upon his fantasies but Adam somehow engenders a passionate spark in him and he ends up with a new invigorated love life with his girlfriend.Finally there's Alice, trapped in a loveless marriage who also has a child. Alice is aware that Adam has been playing around with BOTH of her sisters and when she finally gives in to Adam before his marriage to Lucy, it's on HER terms. She knows it's just a fling, but the brief affair with Adam awakens her long repressed sexual passions.For those who were 'offended' by this film, they completely miss the purpose of farce. In the words of the noted drama critic Eric Bentley, in farce, one is permitted the outrage without the consequences! Farce allows its audience to experience deep-seated desires vicariously! While the sisters feel there is some deeper meaning in Adam's name (noting that Adam is the name of the progenitor of all men), one should liken him more to the Greek God Pan, famous for his sexual powers and often depicted with an erect phallus.The world of 'About Adam' features no recriminations. While some feelings are ruffled, none of the characters suffer any permanent psychic damage. Even Laura, probably the most besotted and jealous of the sisters, accepts Adam's marriage to Lucy and we see her holding hands with her school supervisor at the end of the film, now ready for a mature romance in the real world. And although Adam is always lying to each of the women about his background, the lies are white lies--inconsequential; again resulting in no harm (Adam even suggests to Lucy who is having second thoughts about getting married just as they're about to tie the knot, that people don't always have to know each other's secrets; that way, petty jealousies are averted!).'About Adam' is like a gentle breeze. It's a light-hearted farce not to be taken too seriously (for all of you offended by its alleged 'immorality', I say get a life!). In addition, it's an original take on the desire for passion in our lives. On the other hand, by the end of the film, we realize that the film's tension has dissipated. All that fun 'passion' unleashed in each sibling by the charming rake Adam, has become a bit repetitious and overdone. In other words, we get the point! By the end there are no more surprises! Since 'About Adam' is a bit offbeat and good-natured, I give it a '3'. But honestly, while 'About Adam' is definitely worth watching, one viewing is enough.",3,Farce not comedy,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,4095,"['Adam', 'billed', 'comedy', 'safer', 'classify', 'farce', 'set', 'Dublin', 'family', 'three', 'sisters', 'one', 'brother', 'who', 'become', 'besotted', 'Adam', 'charming', 'Lothario', 'who', 'lives', 'most', 'American', 'films', 'where', 'men', 'end', 'up', 'chasing', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Adam', 'tables', ""'re"", 'treated', 'farcical', 'machinations', 'women', 'who', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'control', 'passions', 'when', 'attracted', 'one', 'special', ""'mysterious"", 'man', 'Adam', 'Rashomon-like', 'plot', 'where', 'story', 'told', 'successive', 'points', 'view', 'sibling', 'start', 'Lucy', 'point', 'view', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'who', 'Adam', 'place', 'employment', 'where', 'waitress/singer', 'Lucy', 'looking', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'sweep', 'feet', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'Adam', 'press', 'right', 'buttons', 'women', 'become', 'besotted', 'initial', 'seduction', 'Lucy', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'obsession', 'tiresome', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'weakest', 'part', 'film', '.After', 'hour', 'film', 'conflict', 'finally', 'Soon', 'meeting', 'Lucy', 'Adam', 'seduce', 'Lucy', 'sister', 'Laura', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'Laura', 'more', 'intellectual', 'Lucy', 'studying', 'PhD', 'poetry', 'course', 'Adam', 'familiar', 'very', 'obscure', 'poetry', 'Lucy', 'been', 'studying', 'school', 'pressing', 'buttons', 'know', 'Laura', 'stripping', 'off', 'clothes', 'Adam', ""n't"", 'finished', 'Brother', 'David', 'attracted', 'Adam', 'having', 'bi-sexual', 'affair', ""n't"", 'actually', 'act', 'fantasies', 'Adam', 'somehow', 'passionate', 'spark', 'up', 'new', 'invigorated', 'love', 'life', 'girlfriend.Finally', 'Alice', 'trapped', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'who', 'also', 'child', 'Alice', 'aware', 'Adam', 'been', 'playing', 'BOTH', 'sisters', 'when', 'finally', 'Adam', 'marriage', 'Lucy', 'terms', 'just', 'fling', 'brief', 'affair', 'Adam', 'long', 'repressed', 'sexual', 'passions.For', 'who', 'were', ""'offended"", 'film', 'completely', 'miss', 'purpose', 'farce', 'words', 'noted', 'drama', 'critic', 'Eric', 'Bentley', 'farce', 'one', 'permitted', 'outrage', 'consequences', 'Farce', 'audience', 'experience', 'deep-seated', 'desires', 'vicariously', 'sisters', 'feel', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'Adam', 'name', 'noting', 'Adam', 'name', 'progenitor', 'men', 'one', 'should', 'liken', 'more', 'Greek', 'God', 'Pan', 'famous', 'sexual', 'powers', 'often', 'depicted', 'erect', 'phallus.The', 'world', ""'About"", 'Adam', 'recriminations', 'feelings', 'are', 'ruffled', 'none', 'characters', 'suffer', 'permanent', 'psychic', 'damage', 'Even', 'Laura', 'probably', 'most', 'besotted', 'jealous', 'sisters', 'Adam', 'marriage', 'Lucy', 'see', 'holding', 'hands', 'school', 'supervisor', 'end', 'film', 'now', 'ready', 'mature', 'romance', 'real', 'world', 'Adam', 'always', 'lying', 'women', 'background', 'lies', 'are', 'white', 'lies', 'inconsequential', 'again', 'resulting', 'harm', 'Adam', 'even', 'Lucy', 'who', 'having', 'second', 'thoughts', 'getting', 'married', 'just', ""'re"", 'tie', 'knot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'know', 'other', 'secrets', 'way', 'petty', 'jealousies', 'are', 'averted', 'Adam', 'gentle', 'breeze', 'light-hearted', 'farce', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously', 'offended', 'alleged', ""'immorality"", 'say', 'get', 'life', 'addition', 'original', 'take', 'desire', 'passion', 'lives', 'other', 'hand', 'end', 'film', 'realize', 'film', 'tension', 'dissipated', 'fun', ""'passion"", 'unleashed', 'sibling', 'charming', 'rake', 'Adam', 'become', 'bit', 'repetitious', 'overdone', 'other', 'words', 'get', 'point', 'end', 'are', 'more', 'surprises', 'Adam', 'bit', 'offbeat', 'good-natured', 'give', '3', 'honestly', 'Adam', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'viewing', 'enough']",About Adam
