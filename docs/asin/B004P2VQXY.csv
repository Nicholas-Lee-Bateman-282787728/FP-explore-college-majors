1423272,AWA88F5TOX8VL,B004P2VQXY,"4-Legged Defender ""Anthony C. Rubbo""","[14, 17]","[HURRY SUNDOWN - (1967) - Widescreen presentation]  Personally, I'm glad Olive films are releasing a handful of Otto Preminger's films from his latter career that weren't previously available. 'Such Good Friends' (1971) was such an unexpected treat that I jumped on this one immediately, though the results were murky this time out. First off, the audio is not as good as other Olive films; this one's all treble with no bass and little mid-section, and can be grating during certain dialogue-heavy scenes. The video is good, not great, but the aspect ratio is fine. And I'm a fan of Preminger's directorial skills - so no problem there. Now let's discuss the cast and not-so-petty annoyances, shall we?Before I go on, let me state that I love Michael Caine's body of work during the 60's, 70's and 80's. But he's so horribly miscast here as a Southern landowner in 1940's Georgia that he threatens to destroy the essence of the entire film. His cockney confederate accent is mostly atrocious, and he's the lynchpin in a film about racial prejudice, avaricious land-grabbing and civil unrest - he's about as Southern as a mint julep in Buckingham Palace. He looks the part, but every other time he utters a sentence, his credibility's crushed. The same can be said of Jane Fonda (another actor I adored throughout her 60s' work) - she slips in and out of a Southern drawl constantly throughout the film, but is still compelling to watch. As a matter of fact, the only actors who lend credence to the film's location and time period are Burgess Merideth (simply scorching as a racist redneck judge), George Kennedy (duplicating the sheriff's role he played in 'Cool Hand Luke' the previous year), Faye Dunaway (though her role is decidedly smaller than you'd think, as 'Bonnie and Clyde' hadn't been released yet) and the considerably lesser-known character actors. Hardly anyone else sounds like they've even vacationed in the south, seen a Tennessee Williams play or even caught an episode of 'Green Acres', let alone 'Hee Haw'. Robert Hooks and Diahann Carroll, as poor black farmers, sound about as country black as Cicily Tyson and James Earl Jones. And John Phillip Law appears to be in rehearsal for the emotional range needed for his upcoming role in 'Danger: Diabolik' (a Euro comic book). There's no way Preminger was unaware of this, but who knew what he was thinking?If it weren't for the many cars and trucks littered about informing us of the era, you'd certainly never know it from the way the women were dressed - there's nothing even remotely 1940's about the dresses Jane Fonda slinks in and out of, not that I'm complaining so much here, just making a costuming point. Even Hugo Montenegro's score is suffering from MPD (multiple personality disorder); the first half of the film it's as melodramatically sappy as its plot before shifting gears later on, infusing 60's soul-groove sounds at inappropriate moments. But, in hindsight, the film is a transcendent trainwreck that's captivating in spite of itself. Partially because of the cast, even those miscast, partially because of Preminger's distinct eye, style and timing (was this film made before or after he did acid with Groucho Marx while filming 'Skidoo'? If it was after, no explanations are needed), partially 'cause it was the experimental 60's when throwing disparate objects and ideas into a blender to forge something new was all the rage. As much as I might otherwise like to, I can't in good faith trash this flick for being the trash some would consider it to be. OK, so it's not 'Laura', 'Anatomy of a Murder' or 'Man with the Golden Arm', but it sure is a lot of fun to watch (despite the shockingly racist remarks and dialogue) in a latter-day John Waters meets Harold Robbins sort of way...3 1/2 stars.",4,What If Tennessee Williams Scripted 'Green Acres'?,1311724800,"07 27, 2011",2011,3792,"['[', 'HURRY', 'SUNDOWN', '1967', 'Widescreen', 'presentation', ']', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Olive', 'films', 'are', 'releasing', 'handful', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'films', 'latter', 'career', 'were', ""n't"", 'previously', 'available', ""'Such"", 'Good', 'Friends', '1971', 'was', 'such', 'unexpected', 'treat', 'jumped', 'one', 'immediately', 'results', 'were', 'murky', 'time', 'out', 'First', 'audio', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'Olive', 'films', 'one', 'treble', 'bass', 'little', 'mid-section', 'can', 'be', 'grating', 'certain', 'dialogue-heavy', 'scenes', 'video', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'fine', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Preminger', 'directorial', 'skills', 'so', 'problem', 'there', 'Now', 'let', 'discuss', 'cast', 'not-so-petty', 'annoyances', 'shall', 'go', 'let', 'state', 'love', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'body', 'work', '60', '70', '80', 'so', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'here', 'Southern', 'landowner', '1940', 'Georgia', 'destroy', 'essence', 'entire', 'film', 'cockney', 'confederate', 'accent', 'mostly', 'atrocious', 'lynchpin', 'film', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'avaricious', 'land-grabbing', 'civil', 'unrest', 'about', 'as', 'Southern', 'mint', 'julep', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'part', 'other', 'time', 'sentence', 'credibility', 'crushed', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'actor', 'adored', '60s', 'work', 'Southern', 'drawl', 'constantly', 'film', 'still', 'compelling', 'watch', 'matter', 'fact', 'only', 'actors', 'who', 'lend', 'credence', 'film', 'location', 'time', 'period', 'are', 'Burgess', 'Merideth', 'simply', 'scorching', 'racist', 'redneck', 'judge', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'duplicating', 'sheriff', 'role', 'played', ""'Cool"", 'Hand', 'Luke', 'previous', 'year', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'role', 'decidedly', 'smaller', ""'d"", 'think', ""'Bonnie"", 'Clyde', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'released', 'yet', 'considerably', 'lesser-known', 'character', 'actors', 'Hardly', 'anyone', 'else', ""'ve"", 'even', 'vacationed', 'south', 'seen', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'play', 'even', 'caught', 'episode', ""'Green"", 'Acres', 'let', 'alone', ""'Hee"", 'Haw', 'Robert', 'Hooks', 'Diahann', 'Carroll', 'poor', 'black', 'farmers', 'sound', 'country', 'black', 'Cicily', 'Tyson', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'John', 'Phillip', 'Law', 'be', 'rehearsal', 'emotional', 'range', 'needed', 'upcoming', 'role', ""'Danger"", 'Diabolik', 'Euro', 'comic', 'book', 'way', 'Preminger', 'was', 'unaware', 'who', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'were', ""n't"", 'many', 'cars', 'trucks', 'littered', 'informing', 'era', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'never', 'know', 'way', 'women', 'were', 'dressed', 'nothing', 'even', 'remotely', '1940', 'dresses', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'slinks', 'not', ""'m"", 'complaining', 'so', 'much', 'here', 'just', 'making', 'costuming', 'point', 'Even', 'Hugo', 'Montenegro', 'score', 'suffering', 'MPD', 'multiple', 'personality', 'disorder', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'melodramatically', 'sappy', 'plot', 'shifting', 'gears', 'later', 'infusing', '60', 'soul-groove', 'sounds', 'inappropriate', 'moments', 'hindsight', 'film', 'transcendent', 'trainwreck', 'captivating', 'spite', 'Partially', 'cast', 'even', 'miscast', 'partially', 'Preminger', 'distinct', 'eye', 'style', 'timing', 'was', 'film', 'made', 'did', 'acid', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'filming', ""'Skidoo"", 'was', 'explanations', 'are', 'needed', 'partially', 'was', 'experimental', '60', 'when', 'throwing', 'disparate', 'objects', 'ideas', 'blender', 'forge', 'something', 'new', 'was', 'rage', 'As', 'much', 'might', 'otherwise', 'like', 'ca', ""n't"", 'good', 'faith', 'trash', 'flick', 'being', 'trash', 'would', 'consider', 'be', 'OK', 'not', ""'Laura"", ""'Anatomy"", 'Murder', 'Golden', 'Arm', 'sure', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'shockingly', 'racist', 'remarks', 'dialogue', 'latter-day', 'John', 'Waters', 'meets', 'Harold', 'Robbins', 'sort', 'way', '3', '1/2', 'stars']",Hurry Sundown

1423275,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B004P2VQXY,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","This is a controversial film even if it has been 45 years since it was first released in 1967. However, whereas the film was initially perceived to be about racism in Georgia after World War II and prior to the civil rights movement, the film is also about classism and how institutional infrastructure and power relationships suppressed not only poor African Americans but also the poor white sharecroppers of rural Georgia. The film is about corruption and it does a darn good job at exploring the intimate nature of those with power and those without power. In 1967 the film would naturally be seen as a groundbreaking film about racism, but after 45 years, we see much more commentary about the nature of power and the ability to economically suppress others, including loved ones and relatives.The cast is absolutely terrific. Michael Caine plays ambitious Henry Warren whose plans go awry when his schemes unfold and the oppressed organize. Jane Fonda, like Elizabeth Taylor, is one of the few actresses who can create a genuine sounding southern accent. She is Henry's naive wife Julie Ann. Henry's poor sharecropper cousin, played by John Phillip Law, is one of the intended victims. Julie Ann's old maid, Rose, played by Beah Richards, is the other intended victim.The southern bigotry may seem overdone to younger audiences but this was 1946 small farm town Georgia and this type of racism did exist and it did have an economic function. The justice system was corrupt when it came to racial issues and Burgess Meredith as Judge Purcell and George Kennedy as Sherriff Coombs are maser actors who create authenticity with their acting skills in these roles a villains.Are the poor idealized in this film? Yes, to be honest. Robert Hooks plays Beah Richards' son Reeve and he and Diahann Carroll, playing Vivian Thurlow, are two of the heroic figures in the film. Faye Dunnaway plays John Phillip Law's wife and the depiction of this white family is accurate.The dialogue is sometimes shocking but authentic and screenwriters  Horton Foote and Thomas C. Ryan capture the feel of poor Georgia. This is a pretty fascinating film even if it seems over the top at times.

Risoli ""black farmer""","[13, 16]","With ""Hurry Sundown"" (1967) Otto Preminger was beginning his decline which was the last big budgeted film based on a controversial best-seller which Preminger thrived on in the fifties for his taste for built-in controversy (""Anatomy of a Murder,"" ""Advise and Consent"") (in defense of ""Hurry Sundown"" the screenwriters couldn't have been more competent to turn K.B. Gilden's massive novel into a film: Horton Foote (""The Trip to Bountiful"") and Thomas C. Ryan (Carson McCullers' ""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter""), great screenwriters who know the South).  Preminger, beside the reputation as a tyrant on the set (here Faye Dunaway paid off her contract she earned from Preminger to never have to work with him again), Otto was a great humanist who through ""Hurry Sundown"" managed to present a well-measured and seasoned dose of racial conflict (that the reality of surfaced during the shooting of the film).  Critic Rex Reed who took pot shots at Preminger for the rest of his career was called upon to make retractions about falsities he printed during the making as well).  The critics who panned Preminger's later work taken together can ""make my skin crawl"" as Jane Fonda later says to Michael Caine after she realizes what he's capable of, and here's to wishing they can speak of his praises. Preminger as a film-maker rarely went over budget and his direction can be fascinating to watch in his conciseness.  Michael Caine manages his Southern accent well despite his own natural accent and Jane Fonda, Frank Converse, Robert Hooks, John Phillip Law, Faye Dunaway, Diahann Carroll, Burgess Meredith, George Kennedy, Beah Richards, Madeleine Sherwood, Doro Merande, Jim Backus, Robert Reed are all well-cast.  The result is campy, but there are a few genuinely touching scenes (especially from Beah Richards) that receive help from Hugo Montenegro's wonderful score.  Preminger did not do anything on such a grand scale again, at least until the failure of ""Rosebud"" in 1975 (which deserves to be seen today as it deals with terrorism and could have likely been taken from today's headlines).  ""Hurry Sundown"" was rated ""C"" by the Catholic Legion of Decency upon release, and Preminger's scenes that heightened that controversy (the saxophone scene between Caine and Fonda) and other touches that spiced the content remain adult today as the film still carries an ""O"" rating for ""Objectionable"" which the Catholics use today than their original ratings even in some cases changing the ratings through the years to less offensive depending on their judgement.  I am glad Olive Films has taken up to releasing all of Preminger's Paramount product at the end of his career.  They are a class act.  They are in support apparently of the greatness that was Otto Preminger and you should too.",4,It makes my skin crawl!,1305936000,"05 21, 2011",2011,2789,"['Hurry', 'Sundown', '1967', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'was', 'beginning', 'decline', 'was', 'last', 'big', 'budgeted', 'film', 'based', 'controversial', 'best-seller', 'Preminger', 'thrived', 'fifties', 'taste', 'built-in', 'controversy', 'Anatomy', 'Murder', 'Advise', 'Consent', 'defense', 'Hurry', 'Sundown', 'screenwriters', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'competent', 'turn', 'K.B', 'Gilden', 'massive', 'novel', 'film', 'Horton', 'Foote', 'Trip', 'Bountiful', 'Thomas', 'C.', 'Ryan', 'Carson', 'McCullers', 'Heart', 'Lonely', 'Hunter', 'great', 'screenwriters', 'who', 'know', 'South', 'Preminger', 'reputation', 'tyrant', 'set', 'here', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'paid', 'off', 'contract', 'earned', 'Preminger', 'never', 'have', 'work', 'again', 'Otto', 'was', 'great', 'humanist', 'who', 'Hurry', 'Sundown', 'managed', 'present', 'well-measured', 'seasoned', 'dose', 'racial', 'conflict', 'reality', 'surfaced', 'shooting', 'film', 'Critic', 'Rex', 'Reed', 'who', 'took', 'pot', 'shots', 'Preminger', 'rest', 'career', 'was', 'called', 'make', 'retractions', 'falsities', 'printed', 'making', 'as', 'well', 'critics', 'who', 'panned', 'Preminger', 'later', 'work', 'taken', 'together', 'can', 'make', 'skin', 'crawl', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'later', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'what', 'capable', 'here', 'wishing', 'can', 'speak', 'praises', 'Preminger', 'film-maker', 'rarely', 'went', 'budget', 'direction', 'can', 'be', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'conciseness', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Southern', 'accent', 'well', 'own', 'natural', 'accent', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Frank', 'Converse', 'Robert', 'Hooks', 'John', 'Phillip', 'Law', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Diahann', 'Carroll', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'Beah', 'Richards', 'Madeleine', 'Sherwood', 'Doro', 'Merande', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'Robert', 'Reed', 'are', 'well-cast', 'result', 'campy', 'are', 'few', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'scenes', 'especially', 'Beah', 'Richards', 'receive', 'help', 'Hugo', 'Montenegro', 'wonderful', 'score', 'Preminger', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'grand', 'scale', 'again', 'least', 'failure', 'Rosebud', '1975', 'be', 'seen', 'today', 'terrorism', 'could', 'have', 'likely', 'been', 'taken', 'today', 'headlines', 'Hurry', 'Sundown', 'was', 'rated', 'C', 'Catholic', 'Legion', 'Decency', 'release', 'Preminger', 'scenes', 'heightened', 'controversy', 'saxophone', 'scene', 'Caine', 'Fonda', 'other', 'touches', 'spiced', 'content', 'remain', 'adult', 'today', 'film', 'still', 'O', 'rating', 'Objectionable', 'Catholics', 'use', 'today', 'original', 'ratings', 'even', 'cases', 'changing', 'ratings', 'years', 'less', 'offensive', 'depending', 'judgement', 'am', 'glad', 'Olive', 'Films', 'taken', 'up', 'releasing', 'Preminger', 'Paramount', 'product', 'end', 'career', 'are', 'class', 'act', 'are', 'support', 'apparently', 'greatness', 'was', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'should', 'too']",Hurry Sundown
