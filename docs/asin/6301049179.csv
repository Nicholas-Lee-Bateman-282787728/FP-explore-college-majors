243994,AIMR915K4YCN,6301049179,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[1, 1]","THE UNINVITED is about a mutant cat (known as ST-618) that escapes from a secret lab, after killing several scientists. The ferocious feline has what appears to be a little demon cat living in its mouth! When provoked, out comes Tiny Paws! This cat's dynamite! Meanwhile, a criminal zillionaire named Walter and his cronies (George Kennedy and Clu Gulager) are out on his yacht, murdering a blackmailer. ST-618 hitches a ride w/ a couple of hillbillies, eats their faces, and forces them off a cliff. Unsurprisingly, the killer kitty finds its way on to Walter's yacht, by acting cute and getting itself adopted by two beautiful, bikini-clad women. Once on board, after what feels like an eternity, the hell-cat sabotages the boat, and finally kills Clu Gulager. Next, it eats George Kennedy's foot off! What this movie lacks in action, thrills, and a solid storyline, it more than makes up for w/ pure, unbridled idiocy! The poor cat looks bored most of the time, the bikini babes have a combined IQ of about 8, and the rest of the characters are so annoying that I was hoping the yacht would just sink!

244000,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6301049179,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","Uninvited (Greydon Clark, 1988)While Greydon Clark was primarily a director of bad action films, that never stopped him from dabbling in every genre he could get his hands on. He made the cult sci-fi classic The Return, a blaxploitation flick, a godawful dance movie, and a western here and there. But the genre to which he kept returning was horror. He never quite got it right, but most of his attempts in the genre are at least stupidly watchable. The sole exception is Uninvited, the only Greydon Clark film that was ever direct-to-video. Given  how bad Clark's theatrical releases were, that ought to tell you something. I have now seen it, and I'm here to inform you that it doesn't tell you nearly enough.Plot: a genetically-mutated cat harboring a carnivorous beast that looks sort of like a wet beaver (again, if you've seen Greydon Clark movies, you'll know that symbolism is very much intended) escapes the lab and finds its way onto the luxury yacht of a couple of very nasty men, Walter Graham (Airwolf's Alex Cord) and Mike Harvey (the great George Kennedy, in his nadir as an actor). There's a lot of other stuff with some young-and-beautifuls Graham convinces to be on the boat, which isn't his, but the main point is that this cat...beaver...thing that east people is on the boat with them and they're out in the middle of the sea. Did I mention engine failure (yes, caused by the cat)?It's terrible, terrible, terrible. While I haven't seen all of Clark's output (I'm not that much of a masochist), this is by far the worst of his movies I've seen. It's ludicrous through and through. The creature effects are hysterical, the script doubly so. The most impressive thing about the movie is that Clark managed to somehow wheedle Cord, Kennedy, and Clu Galager, who has a brief role as a drunk pilot, to appear in this monstrosity. (It was also an early role for Rob Estes, who would go on to superstardom in Melrose Place five years later.) About the only thing I can say about this movie to halfway recommend it is that it's unintentionally hilarious.
