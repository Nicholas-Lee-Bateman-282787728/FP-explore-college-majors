792717,A2MW0RYIXMEYGS,B00013WWNY,Dave,"[2, 3]","Ebenezer Nezzer is one of the richest vegetables in town. He owns half the town (including the town church), and runs his own egg factory, which was given to him by his grandmother right before she died. The town loved Grandma Nezzer, as did the chickens that were in her factory. But ever since Grandma died, the chickens slacked off, and Nezzer became a greedy loner. He is determined to make Grandma last forever, and replaces the chickens with plastic ones, the inevitable result of which is plastic eggs, so they will truly last this Easter. Ebby's perception of the true meaning of Easter is as hollow as his factory's plastic eggs.Factory workers Cavis and Milword (Bob and Larry) are concerned about Nezzer's attitude, but they are more concerned about getting time off to attend the church's Easter service, and subsequent unveiling of the new stained glass window. When Ebby is paid a visit by the Reverend and his little boy, who invite him to church, Nezzer has a surprise for him instead; plans to replace the church with his own version of Easter, Easterland, in honor of Grandma's favorite holiday.Everyone wants to stop him, but since he owns the property, they are powerless.Nezzer is resolute; until the small music box on his mantle comes to life, turning into a musical, but somewhat feisty angel named Hope (voiced by Rebecca St. James). It's up to Hope to teach Nezzer the true meaning of the Hope of Easter - before it is too late!!BAD: There's absolutely nothing bad about this film, except perhaps that younger kids who don't know better might be frightened by Grandma's appearance, protruding from the large painting of her above Nezzer's fireplace. (Grandma quickly explains that there's no such things as ghosts, it's just a vision)GOOD: It's all good! The film actually deals with serious issues that aren't often explored in children's movies and films, such as life and death. But I think it's great that VeggieTales takes a very healthy approach to the whole thing, and gives a positive outlook on it, as well as the message of Hope.THOUGHTS: VeggieTales keeps making advances and one-upping themselves, and An Easter Carol certainly does that. Great music (strange for the two guys who don't know how to read music!!), great teaching, great animation. The sequence wherein Hope demonstrates the story of Jesus for Nezzer via the stained glass windows of the church is absolutely gorgeous. I kept expecting her song to turn loud and raucous like some of her more contemporary ones, but it didn't. It really has given me a bit of a new appreciation for Easter.It's also wonderful to see VeggieTales proclaim Jesus' name. While presenting awesome Biblical values, they've stopped short of mentioning his name in several of their features, but there's no more of that.Among all the ideas and commercialism asserting that Easter is about bunnies, ribbons, and eggs, it's certainly wonderful to see the message of Easter, even if we've come to expect it from our friends at Big Idea.Great buy, and a must have.

The angel, voiced by Rebecca St. James, is especially lovely, and her voice is gorgeous.  The mechanical chickens and the chicken rap are absolutely hysterical, and the story about Mrs. Nezzer, the Christian grandma, is extremely touching for both young and old.However, in adapting it from Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol,"" there are times when I thought the story dragged on a bit just for the sake of having ""parallels"" to the other story.  Easter Future was especially convoluted.  My 6yo couldn't understand why there could be no Easter just because there wasn't a pretty church nearby (""You don't need a church to believe in Jesus, right, Mommy?"")  It could have used some serious editing.This is the most explicitly Christian of all the Veggie Tales videos thus far.  The other ones (Jonah, Josh and the Big Wall, The Ballad of Little Joe, Madame Blueberry) all could be said to fall under the general category of ""Judeo-Christian values"" or Barney-esque ""good morality tales,"" but this one makes explicit to children why belief in Jesus is so important and why Easter is such a joyous occasion.  The timing of this video couldn't be better, either.  I suspect a lot of little ones will get reminders about Mr. Nezzer when pining after chocolate bunnies this year. =)Though it has some shortcomings, they are negligible in terms of its overall enjoyability, and it's definitely a beautiful video worth watching.",4,Very cute!,1077494400,"02 23, 2004",2004,1504,"['lot', 'love', 'DVD', 'got', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'music', 'angel', 'voiced', 'Rebecca', 'St.', 'James', 'especially', 'lovely', 'voice', 'gorgeous', 'mechanical', 'chickens', 'chicken', 'rap', 'are', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'story', 'Mrs.', 'Nezzer', 'Christian', 'grandma', 'extremely', 'touching', 'young', 'old.However', 'adapting', 'Dickens', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'thought', 'story', 'dragged', 'bit', 'just', 'sake', 'having', 'parallels', 'other', 'story', 'Easter', 'Future', 'was', 'especially', 'convoluted', '6yo', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'could', 'be', 'Easter', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'church', 'nearby', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'church', 'believe', 'Jesus', 'right', 'Mommy', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'serious', 'editing.This', 'most', 'explicitly', 'Christian', 'Veggie', 'Tales', 'videos', 'thus', 'far', 'other', 'ones', 'Jonah', 'Josh', 'Big', 'Wall', 'Ballad', 'Little', 'Joe', 'Madame', 'Blueberry', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'fall', 'general', 'category', 'Judeo-Christian', 'values', 'Barney-esque', 'good', 'morality', 'tales', 'one', 'explicit', 'children', 'why', 'belief', 'Jesus', 'so', 'important', 'why', 'Easter', 'such', 'joyous', 'occasion', 'timing', 'video', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'suspect', 'lot', 'little', 'ones', 'will', 'get', 'reminders', 'Mr.', 'Nezzer', 'when', 'pining', 'chocolate', 'bunnies', 'year', '=', 'shortcomings', 'are', 'negligible', 'terms', 'overall', 'enjoyability', 'definitely', 'beautiful', 'video', 'watching']",N/A

Beside, church is just something that keeps people from buying his eggs on Easter morning.But the night before Easter, he has a vision.

The story goes beyond the true meaning of Easter to touch on what that means in the lives of Christians, something I truly appreciated.

A plastic egg making factory (with plastic chickens who lay those eggs;)  ) Mr Nezzer believes that Easter is all about the eggs, and he is preparing to tear down the church to make an ""Easter Land"".  He is visited by his Grandma (who had passed away the year before) who told him he would have a visitor who would explain to him what he was doing wrong.  Hope (Rebecca St. James) is a little angel who takes him to the past, present and future.The gospel is presented in the very end, mostly in a single song, but it is clear that Jesus is the reason for Easter and that He died on the cross for our sins.A fun/short little movie about why we celebrate Easter.** This is a review of a movie my kids got from Grandma and Grandpa this Easter, and has in no way been paid for by Big Idea's, Veggie Tales or anyone else who might have a connection to Veggie Tales[...]",5,An Easter Carol,1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,1318,"['Easter', 'Carol', 'Veggie', 'TalesAn', 'Easter', 'Carol', 'one', 'last', 'Veggie', 'movies', 'was', 'produced', 'Big', 'Idea', 'studio', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'one', 'last', 'truly', 'Christian', 'theme', 'More', 'later.An', 'Easter', 'Carol', 'lot', 'guessed', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'few', 'other', 'comedic', 'throw', 'other', 'movies', 'Mr', 'Nezzer', 'Millward', 'Larry', 'uncle', 'owner', 'egg', 'making', 'factory', 'plastic', 'egg', 'making', 'factory', 'plastic', 'chickens', 'who', 'lay', 'eggs', 'Mr', 'Nezzer', 'Easter', 'eggs', 'preparing', 'tear', 'down', 'church', 'make', 'Easter', 'Land', 'visited', 'Grandma', 'who', 'had', 'passed', 'away', 'year', 'who', 'told', 'would', 'have', 'visitor', 'who', 'would', 'explain', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'wrong', 'Hope', 'Rebecca', 'St.', 'James', 'little', 'angel', 'who', 'past', 'present', 'future.The', 'gospel', 'presented', 'very', 'end', 'mostly', 'single', 'song', 'clear', 'Jesus', 'reason', 'Easter', 'died', 'cross', 'sins.A', 'fun/short', 'little', 'movie', 'why', 'celebrate', 'Easter', '**', 'review', 'movie', 'kids', 'got', 'Grandma', 'Grandpa', 'Easter', 'way', 'been', 'paid', 'Big', 'Idea', 'Veggie', 'Tales', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'connection', 'Veggie', 'Tales', '[', ']']",N/A

The highlight of the show is the tear-jerking ballad sung by angelic ""Hope"" to a backdrop of stained glass pictorials of Jesus's life from birth to death to resurrection. I still cry every time I watch the tender scene.My only complaint is the rather awkward emphasis by the Veggie-version of Marley's ghost--Grandma Nezzer--who makes a big point of saying that she is not a ghost, but a vision, then explaining how a vision is different. ""Hope"", the Veggie-version of all three ghosts of Christmas, also explains that she is not a ghost, but the ""Hope"" of Easter. It throws off the rhythm of the humor and story, and overall, seems more confusing to kids. I understand if some Christian denominations don't like the idea of ghosts--but it IS a fictional story; afterall, there's also no such thing as talking vegetables.Overall, worth investing in.

It takes place after THE STAR OF CHRISTMAS and includes all of the main characters from that Veggie Tale (though most are in smaller roles). AN EASTER CAROL is a spoof of Charles Dickens' beloved A CHRISTMAS CAROL. However, instead of a miser who loves money, AN EASTER CAROL presents us with a miserly pickle, Mr. Nezzar, who is so infatuated with Easter and making plastic Easter eggs that he wants to tear down the local church to build an amusement park called Easterland. He wants to do this to honor his deceased Grandma who loved Easter. But Nezzar has it all wrong and it takes a visit from his Grandma and a music box angel named Hope to set him straight. AN EASTER CAROL is a nice way to reunite the characters of THE STAR OF CHRISTMAS. It has some new original songs, including one sung by Rebecca St. James (who provides the voice of Hope). Overall, the video is a joy to watch and has a great message.
