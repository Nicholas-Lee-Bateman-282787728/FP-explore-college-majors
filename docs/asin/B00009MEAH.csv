754198,A3HMOQO8J0SOC3,B00009MEAH,"bix lang ""pastafagiole""","[2, 2]","Buddy Rich played the drums without peer; he possessed lightening speed, but even more important, a self-taught technique that is often overlooked because of his sensational pyrotechnics. Beneath all the bravado, Buddy was also a very nice and generous person. Today's Neanderthal rock drummers, with their twenty piece kits with seventy-five cymbals could take a lesson and a half from him. The jazz drummers as a general rule have always been lightyears ahead of rock's noisemakers. Louis Belson, Gene Krupa, Syd Catlett, Dave Tough, etc., were all great musicians as well as great drummers. They had style, musicality, technique and natural ability that most rock drummers could only dream of possessing. They didn't just beat their snare like a caveman. These guys knew music. And at the top of this esteemed list sits Buddy Rich. In this DVD, Rich leads a big band whose members' average age is just twenty-two, but can they swing! Even at his advanced age and only two years after open-heart surgery, Buddy is playing at the top of his game. Check out his arrangements of ""One O' Clock Jump"" and ""Love For Sale."" It doesn't get much better than this.",5,In A Class By Himself.....Great DVD,1168732800,"01 14, 2007",2007,1156,"['Buddy', 'Rich', 'played', 'drums', 'peer', 'possessed', 'lightening', 'speed', 'even', 'more', 'important', 'self-taught', 'technique', 'often', 'overlooked', 'sensational', 'pyrotechnics', 'bravado', 'Buddy', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'nice', 'generous', 'person', 'Today', 'Neanderthal', 'rock', 'drummers', 'twenty', 'piece', 'kits', 'seventy-five', 'cymbals', 'could', 'take', 'lesson', 'half', 'jazz', 'drummers', 'general', 'rule', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'lightyears', 'ahead', 'rock', 'noisemakers', 'Louis', 'Belson', 'Gene', 'Krupa', 'Syd', 'Catlett', 'Dave', 'Tough', 'etc.', 'were', 'great', 'musicians', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'drummers', 'had', 'style', 'musicality', 'technique', 'natural', 'ability', 'most', 'rock', 'drummers', 'could', 'only', 'dream', 'possessing', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'beat', 'snare', 'caveman', 'guys', 'knew', 'music', 'top', 'esteemed', 'list', 'sits', 'Buddy', 'Rich', 'DVD', 'Rich', 'big', 'band', 'members', 'average', 'age', 'just', 'twenty-two', 'can', 'swing', 'Even', 'advanced', 'age', 'only', 'two', 'years', 'open-heart', 'surgery', 'Buddy', 'playing', 'top', 'game', 'Check', 'out', 'arrangements', 'One', 'O', 'Clock', 'Jump', 'Love', 'Sale', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better']",N/A

And sound?  DTS and Dolby Digital 4.0...can't get better than that.

Having survived (sort of) a fire and the ensuing floodwaters, I suppose the quality is amazing.  Still, it's a let down.  It seemed a perfunctory performance by most of the band and even Buddy appeared worn down though he was doing more than simply going through the  motions.

It is impossible for any of us music, drum, jazz people not to have at least one copy of a CD and or a DVD of Buddy Rich.  This CD contains some of Buddy's best moments along with his awesome band.

754202,A2T05OQ5STEGDZ,B00009MEAH,Robert Miller,"[0, 0]","Channel One Suite debuted on the Buddy Rich Big Band LP in 1974 and my brain could never wrap around how he was able to perform a drum roll (16th notes) with his left hand and add kick beats on his bass drum (8th notes) all while smoothly dropping in fills on his toms. Then, I saw him perform it live twice; this magniicent drummer who can be emulated but never replicated in style, fluidity, timing and strict rudiment performance was the &#34;Secretariet&#34; of drummers. He was the greatest drummer who ever lived. This DVD catches the performance and your eyes still can't grasp the magnitude of what the man is capable of. If Buddy Rich ever had an 'off' night he never showed it. What is interesting is to watch the band's expressions as he solos. No doubt they had heard variations of the solo's performed many times, but apparently never tired of watching him perform. He is flawless, and, even at the age when this recording was made, 1984( I believe), he is pressing the band forward like a freight train. His multiple style of drumming, his attention to 'shades' and 'builds' and his insistence of perfection shine through.",5,"Fabulous, pure Buddy Rich!!",1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,1136,"['Channel', 'One', 'Suite', 'debuted', 'Buddy', 'Rich', 'Big', 'Band', 'LP', '1974', 'brain', 'could', 'never', 'wrap', 'how', 'was', 'able', 'perform', 'drum', 'roll', '16th', 'notes', 'left', 'hand', 'add', 'kick', 'beats', 'bass', 'drum', '8th', 'notes', 'smoothly', 'dropping', 'fills', 'toms', 'Then', 'saw', 'perform', 'live', 'twice', 'magniicent', 'drummer', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'emulated', 'never', 'replicated', 'style', 'fluidity', 'timing', 'strict', 'rudiment', 'performance', 'was', '34', 'Secretariet', '34', 'drummers', 'was', 'greatest', 'drummer', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'DVD', 'performance', 'eyes', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'grasp', 'magnitude', 'what', 'man', 'capable', 'Buddy', 'Rich', 'ever', 'had', ""'off"", 'night', 'never', 'showed', 'What', 'interesting', 'watch', 'band', 'expressions', 'doubt', 'had', 'heard', 'variations', 'solo', 'performed', 'many', 'times', 'apparently', 'never', 'tired', 'watching', 'perform', 'flawless', 'even', 'age', 'when', 'recording', 'was', 'made', '1984', 'believe', 'pressing', 'band', 'forward', 'freight', 'train', 'multiple', 'style', 'drumming', 'attention', ""'shades"", ""'builds"", 'insistence', 'perfection', 'shine']",N/A

Just playin' for the date and then movin' on to the next one.  With all the 'hype' this taping was supposed to have had how did the film get lost for years?  Very nutty!  Who put the money into this?  The venture capitalists would have died had they heard the tapes were lost.  Very screwy story.  And the thing get's released nearly 20 years after it was taped?  Hmmm. . .The whole set is cheesy.  Buddy is in front of neon lights and on a riser that looks like some kind of Egyptian monolith.  The floor of the riser is clear and they put a camera below to see Buddy from down under.  Screwy plot.  All you see is an occasional shot of Buddy's crotch, his feet, his snare drum and the sweat pouring off his face.  Very ridiculous camera angle and uninspiring.There was 'hype' about the killer mics they had on the band.  The sound isn't that great.  In fact I've heard better boot leg .mp3's of the band in the internet.The band plays typical Buddy arrangements and overall I would rate the band's playing as very good.  Except for his trumpet soloist who has no business soloing.  All he does is splat notes (lots of bad notes at that) like some kind of Arturo Sandoval that just been kicked in the crotch.  Certainly Buddy should have noticed the frentic madness of that guy's soloing and put an end to it.  The keyboard player is super.  And that electric bass?  Why Buddy why?The one thing I have never liked about ANY Buddy Rich ensemble is that they DON'T SWING!!  His bands always play like some kind of hard bop ensemble and don't lay back on the notes and phrasing.  Buddy consistently kicked off tunes at torrid tempos forcing the band to really play hard and very on top of the beat.  If you want a band that swings listen to Basie, Boss Brass, etc.In any case this is an important work as Buddy died just a few years later.  I admire Buddy for his incredible talent, drive and ability to keep big band alive.  Personally Buddy is the most outrageous snob drummer to have played the skins.  I sat down two feet from him during a break when he played at BYU and the prick didn't say a word to me despite my adulation.  On the other hand I have been fortunate to meet several gentlemen of the craft including Erskine, Gadd, Roach, Williams, Dejonnete, Hamilton, Cameron and others.  All fine people that treat the commoners with respect.",3,Buddy ok - video and story behind it strange.,1177459200,"04 25, 2007",2007,2435,"['Buddy', 'played', 'well', 'DVD', 'more', 'was', 'road', 'gig', 'somewhere', 'Indiana', 'Just', 'playin', 'date', 'then', 'movin', 'next', 'one', ""'hype"", 'taping', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'had', 'how', 'did', 'film', 'get', 'lost', 'years', 'Very', 'nutty', 'Who', 'put', 'money', 'venture', 'capitalists', 'would', 'have', 'died', 'had', 'heard', 'tapes', 'were', 'lost', 'Very', 'screwy', 'story', 'thing', 'get', 'released', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'was', 'taped', 'Hmmm', '.The', 'whole', 'set', 'cheesy', 'Buddy', 'front', 'neon', 'lights', 'riser', 'kind', 'Egyptian', 'monolith', 'floor', 'riser', 'clear', 'put', 'camera', 'see', 'Buddy', 'down', 'Screwy', 'plot', 'see', 'occasional', 'shot', 'Buddy', 'crotch', 'feet', 'snare', 'drum', 'sweat', 'pouring', 'off', 'face', 'Very', 'ridiculous', 'camera', 'angle', 'uninspiring.There', 'was', ""'hype"", 'killer', 'mics', 'had', 'band', 'sound', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'better', 'boot', '.mp3', 'band', 'internet.The', 'band', 'typical', 'Buddy', 'arrangements', 'overall', 'would', 'rate', 'band', 'playing', 'very', 'good', 'trumpet', 'soloist', 'who', 'business', 'soloing', 'splat', 'notes', 'lots', 'bad', 'notes', 'kind', 'Arturo', 'Sandoval', 'just', 'been', 'kicked', 'crotch', 'Certainly', 'Buddy', 'should', 'have', 'noticed', 'frentic', 'madness', 'guy', 'soloing', 'put', 'end', 'keyboard', 'player', 'super', 'electric', 'bass', 'Why', 'Buddy', 'why', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'never', 'liked', 'ANY', 'Buddy', 'Rich', 'ensemble', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'SWING', 'bands', 'always', 'play', 'kind', 'hard', 'bop', 'ensemble', 'do', ""n't"", 'lay', 'back', 'notes', 'phrasing', 'Buddy', 'consistently', 'kicked', 'off', 'tunes', 'torrid', 'tempos', 'forcing', 'band', 'really', 'play', 'hard', 'very', 'top', 'beat', 'want', 'band', 'swings', 'listen', 'Basie', 'Boss', 'Brass', 'case', 'important', 'work', 'Buddy', 'died', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'admire', 'Buddy', 'incredible', 'talent', 'drive', 'ability', 'keep', 'big', 'band', 'alive', 'Personally', 'Buddy', 'most', 'outrageous', 'snob', 'drummer', 'have', 'played', 'skins', 'sat', 'down', 'two', 'feet', 'break', 'when', 'played', 'BYU', 'prick', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'word', 'adulation', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'been', 'fortunate', 'meet', 'several', 'gentlemen', 'craft', 'including', 'Erskine', 'Gadd', 'Roach', 'Williams', 'Dejonnete', 'Hamilton', 'Cameron', 'others', 'fine', 'people', 'treat', 'commoners', 'respect']",N/A
