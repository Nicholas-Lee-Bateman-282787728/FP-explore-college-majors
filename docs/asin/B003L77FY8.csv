1349904,A2VHZY8NHD1K7I,B003L77FY8,Book and music lover &#34;Jane&#34;,"[12, 16]","I am so pleased the fourth and final season of Thirtysomething is being released.  I look forward to seeing Ellyn and Billy as a couple and Melissa and Lee together and the changes in Hope's and Michael's and Elliot's and Nancy's lives.  Some of the best episodes of Miles Drentell are on season four.  There is also an episode that features Melanie Mayron's sister, Gale in which they play sisters with Melissa visiting her sister, Jill Steadman in NYC when Melissa is offered a photography job for Vanity Fair; one of my favorites this season.  There are some emotionally powerful episodes in season four and the original music that was left intact in the episodes including Ray Charles, ""Come Rain or Come Shine.""  I hope there is commentary from Polly Draper on season four.  That would make it perfect.  Thank you so much for releasing to DVD!  :o)",5,Thirtysomething-final season,1276905600,"06 19, 2010",2010,853,"['am', 'so', 'pleased', 'fourth', 'final', 'season', 'Thirtysomething', 'being', 'released', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Ellyn', 'Billy', 'couple', 'Melissa', 'Lee', 'together', 'changes', 'Hope', 'Michael', 'Elliot', 'Nancy', 'lives', 'best', 'episodes', 'Miles', 'Drentell', 'are', 'season', 'four', 'also', 'episode', 'Melanie', 'Mayron', 'sister', 'Gale', 'play', 'sisters', 'Melissa', 'visiting', 'sister', 'Jill', 'Steadman', 'NYC', 'when', 'Melissa', 'offered', 'photography', 'job', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'one', 'favorites', 'season', 'are', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'episodes', 'season', 'four', 'original', 'music', 'was', 'left', 'intact', 'episodes', 'including', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Come', 'Rain', 'Come', 'Shine', 'hope', 'commentary', 'Polly', 'Draper', 'season', 'four', 'would', 'make', 'perfect', 'Thank', 'so', 'much', 'releasing', 'DVD', 'o']",thirtysomething: The Complete Fourth and Final Season

This episode was taken from the last season; and is the follow up to ""Second Look"" there is a distinct feeling of winding down, and the tying of loose ends with Gary's funeral. But I found that even after all these years it can still tug at the heart strings.

I have never found this season anywhere, and despite your complaints, I loved it. You need to remember how times have changed, I thought this season was the best, and quite necessary. It is unavoidable to have lost music and other portions, MGM is now gone.For a program to have coverage on the topics it did, in that time period was epic. They talked about AIDS, showed men in bed together, spoke about abortion. On network TV, then, this was just not allowed.I want to thank Amazon for even getting their hands on it. You just don't realize how different censorship was and copyright laws.I absolutely loved every episode and, as a Prime member, could watch it for free. Being able to see it agin was wonderful for me.Did you know that the characters Michael and Nancy were married in real life?Go ahead and complain about music that had to be changed or missing pats.
