Further, several were independent films. My favorites were:- Billy Jack, created by Tom Laughlin, who passed away last December.- The trilogy of the Wilderness Family Robinson films.Bear in mind, I was a young guy serving in the US Navy, living in LA but stationed in San Diego. I commuted weekends and, an occasional weekday. I was fed up with taking orders and getting stuck in traffic jams. I wanted my boys to grow up among nature, just like the Robinsons.This trilogy is a good story for your children, it is good inspiration for adults. We all can strive for our passion and enjoy this miracle we call life.My dream was to live life my way, among nature. These films fed my dream.I give five stars to this trilogy because it is more than a story. It is a fantastic inspiration. besides the movies listed above, some reading material that feeds the same hunger:- Countryside & Small Stock Journal- Backwoods Home- Home Power- Small Farm Journal- Farmer's Weekly (by Caxton Publishers in South Africa)- the original (1970 through 1980) Mother Earth News",5,Wilderness Family Robinson: Inspiration for Nature Lovers & Homesteaders,1396915200,"04 8, 2014",2014,1509,"['came', 'time', '1970s', '1980s', 'when', 'stories', 'dominated', 'theaters', 'Billy', 'JackWilderness', 'Family', 'RobinsonEmerald', 'ForestThe', 'Gods', 'Must', 'Be', 'CrazyGrizzly', 'AdamsAcross', 'Great', 'DividePlus', 'several', 'others', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall.Yes', 'also', 'were', 'mega', 'hits', 'Battle', 'Star', 'Galactica', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'E.T.', 'etc', 'were', 'blockbusters', 'heavy', 'special', 'effects', 'story', 'were', 'big', 'money', 'films.The', 'common', 'denominator', 'was', 'adventure', 'Further', 'several', 'were', 'independent', 'films', 'favorites', 'were', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'created', 'Tom', 'Laughlin', 'who', 'passed', 'away', 'last', 'December.-', 'trilogy', 'Wilderness', 'Family', 'Robinson', 'films.Bear', 'mind', 'was', 'young', 'guy', 'serving', 'US', 'Navy', 'living', 'LA', 'stationed', 'San', 'Diego', 'commuted', 'weekends', 'occasional', 'weekday', 'was', 'fed', 'up', 'taking', 'orders', 'getting', 'stuck', 'traffic', 'jams', 'wanted', 'boys', 'grow', 'up', 'nature', 'just', 'Robinsons.This', 'trilogy', 'good', 'story', 'children', 'good', 'inspiration', 'adults', 'can', 'strive', 'passion', 'enjoy', 'miracle', 'call', 'life.My', 'dream', 'was', 'live', 'life', 'way', 'nature', 'films', 'fed', 'dream.I', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'trilogy', 'more', 'story', 'fantastic', 'inspiration', 'movies', 'listed', 'reading', 'material', 'same', 'hunger', 'Countryside', 'Small', 'Stock', 'Journal-', 'Backwoods', 'Home-', 'Home', 'Power-', 'Small', 'Farm', 'Journal-', 'Farmer', 'Weekly', 'Caxton', 'Publishers', 'South', 'Africa', 'original', '1970', '1980', 'Mother', 'Earth', 'News']",N/A

Picture quality is also horrible.Examples of unrealistic situations: Family ""hides"" from bear on top of 10ft. cabin which the bear could easily climb if it wanted to.  Mom pets wild bird that lands on her stove; tells daughter a raccoon is ""gentle""; later same raccoon crawls into bed with son; dad and son survive rock avalanche; next dad and son play with baby bears and even bring them into the cabin with them; boy and girl play with baby cougar cubs; dad survives cougar attack.  Curiously we still see bags of sugar/flour on the table.The dialogue and inter-family relations are as if the  family still lived in the city.  The girl and woman physical appearances are always perfect.  In addition, the man is consistently saying everything will be ok and I'll take care of it. The girl is chased by wolves then a bear then gets a high fever, for which the dad has to go for help; meanwhile the boy gets thru everything fine. (stereotype of woman as weaker sex).The overarching themes are that man is more powerful than nature and can survive any creature, though the reverse is more likely (when left without his weapons); and also that humans can control and/or tame nature; that there is nothing dangerous in the wilderness; that it's a cake-walk.One of the stupid instructions given by the mom is that you should boil bark from an Aspen tree if you have a headache bc thats how you make ""Aspen"" (play on the word aspirin I assume).  While feeding a full-sized black bear, the daughter says ""what do we do when we run out of food? and the dad replies ""maybe get back up on the roof lmao.  Then the bear eats You thats what happens.  they even play teetor-tottor with the bear OMG I couldn't wait to see what laughable scene came next...Wilderness living is basically the opposite of everything in this movie, strenuous all-day work--growing vegetables, +hunting, fishing, building fire, keeping away from predators--much of it is about simple survival, like a wild animal--NOT having fun wrestling with cougar cubs and fishing with bears.  I hate to say it but I enjoyed it a bit when a bear came and broke in the house and the woman didn't even know how to use the gun to shoot it---their beloved friendly bear Samson ended up coming and saved them.Though I am a realist I also try to be an  optimist--I admit I may have enjoyed this film in my childhood (being far away from any of the real dangers in nature--and good thing bc if I went by this movie, I'd be dead in a day).  I love the concept of getting away from city life and would love to be able to live in nature.  However, I do not try to deceive myself about the reality of the natural world.This is a feel-good film not to be taken seriously at all and I think its a shame we are so far from real living in our modern world that we show our children hokey films like this one.",2,Totally sugarcoated and unbelievable tale of a family living in nature.,1335830400,"05 1, 2012",2012,3041,"['Everything', 'movie', 'sugarcoated', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'how', 'life', 'really', 'would', 'be', 'family', 'moving', 'wilderness', 'cut', 'off', 'civilization', 'easy', 'LA', 'city', 'living', 'Picture', 'quality', 'also', 'horrible.Examples', 'unrealistic', 'situations', 'Family', 'hides', 'bear', 'top', '10ft', 'cabin', 'bear', 'could', 'easily', 'climb', 'wanted', 'Mom', 'wild', 'bird', 'stove', 'tells', 'daughter', 'raccoon', 'gentle', 'later', 'same', 'raccoon', 'crawls', 'bed', 'son', 'dad', 'son', 'survive', 'rock', 'avalanche', 'next', 'dad', 'son', 'play', 'baby', 'bears', 'even', 'bring', 'cabin', 'boy', 'girl', 'play', 'baby', 'cougar', 'cubs', 'cougar', 'attack', 'Curiously', 'still', 'see', 'bags', 'sugar/flour', 'table.The', 'dialogue', 'inter-family', 'relations', 'are', 'family', 'still', 'lived', 'city', 'girl', 'woman', 'physical', 'appearances', 'are', 'always', 'perfect', 'addition', 'man', 'consistently', 'saying', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'ok', ""'ll"", 'take', 'care', 'girl', 'chased', 'wolves', 'then', 'bear', 'then', 'high', 'fever', 'dad', 'go', 'help', 'meanwhile', 'boy', 'thru', 'everything', 'fine', 'stereotype', 'woman', 'weaker', 'sex', 'overarching', 'themes', 'are', 'man', 'more', 'powerful', 'nature', 'can', 'survive', 'creature', 'reverse', 'more', 'likely', 'when', 'left', 'weapons', 'also', 'humans', 'can', 'control', 'and/or', 'tame', 'nature', 'nothing', 'dangerous', 'wilderness', 'cake-walk.One', 'stupid', 'instructions', 'given', 'mom', 'should', 'boil', 'bark', 'Aspen', 'tree', 'have', 'headache', 'bc', 'how', 'make', 'Aspen', 'play', 'word', 'aspirin', 'assume', 'feeding', 'full-sized', 'black', 'bear', 'daughter', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'when', 'run', 'out', 'food', 'dad', 'maybe', 'get', 'back', 'up', 'roof', 'lmao', 'Then', 'bear', 'thats', 'what', 'even', 'play', 'teetor-tottor', 'bear', 'OMG', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'laughable', 'scene', 'came', 'next', 'Wilderness', 'living', 'basically', 'opposite', 'everything', 'movie', 'strenuous', 'all-day', 'work', 'growing', 'vegetables', '+hunting', 'fishing', 'building', 'fire', 'keeping', 'away', 'predators', 'much', 'about', 'simple', 'survival', 'wild', 'animal', 'NOT', 'having', 'fun', 'wrestling', 'cougar', 'cubs', 'fishing', 'bears', 'hate', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'bit', 'when', 'bear', 'came', 'broke', 'house', 'woman', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'use', 'gun', 'shoot', 'beloved', 'friendly', 'bear', 'Samson', 'ended', 'up', 'coming', 'saved', 'am', 'realist', 'also', 'try', 'be', 'optimist', 'admit', 'may', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'childhood', 'being', 'far', 'away', 'real', 'dangers', 'nature', 'good', 'thing', 'bc', 'went', 'movie', ""'d"", 'be', 'dead', 'day', 'love', 'concept', 'getting', 'away', 'city', 'life', 'would', 'love', 'be', 'able', 'live', 'nature', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'try', 'deceive', 'reality', 'natural', 'world.This', 'feel-good', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'think', 'shame', 'are', 'so', 'far', 'real', 'living', 'modern', 'world', 'show', 'children', 'hokey', 'films', 'one']",N/A

We don't really see how they have a continuous supply of food, but at various times we see them fishing, hunting, having chickens, making a garden, and getting shipments via plane. They deal with a family member getting sick and having to split up to get help without a radio. The kids are charming. The dad is pretty easy going. The mom is reasonably stressed by the situation.
