767352,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B0000AQS4F,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[0, 0]","Based on a true story about two sisters (Papin sisters) who have an incestuous relationship and participate in a brutal murder of their employers.  The 2002 French film begins with the girls of young age in a convent.  Within the first 30/40 minutes, while the girls are young, it is confusing to know who is who, and what is going on.  So, pay attention closely.Fast forward to young adulthood, and the picture becomes more clear the older girl, Christine and a younger one called Lea.Up front, we learn of family issues, particularly with the mother.  Jump to mother who has a new husband who makes a pass to the younger Lea.  Another issue is that Mother has a new husband, and it seems the usual creepy stuff has gone on.  There isn't a lot of information on the past as it moves quickly.These supporting characters play minor roles, as the focus moves on to the young sisters and their jobs as maids as they eventually end up working in the same household, where they have an incestuous relationship and participate in a gruesome murder of two people in the home.I was not exactly mesmerized by the film, more confused at the beginning. Not sure what was missing, but I give it an ok.The role of Christine is played by Sylvie Testud, and her appearance fits the character, her acting is great as her face often reveals the that look on her face, always mysterious, twisted, haunted, and downright evil when the time comes.  The setting with the 30s period furniture is remarkable, impressive to that era in France.  The movie demonstrates the social class differences.  .....

767355,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0000AQS4F,Lawyeraau,"[11, 12]","This film tells the tawdry story of the notorious Papin sisters, and it is quite a story. In early 1933, a crime of dreadful and shocking brutality stunned the nation of France, and its citizens watched in horror as the facts unfolded.  The Papin sisters, Christine and Lea, stood accused of savagely murdering their employer, Madame Lancelin,  and her daughter, Genevieve, in the household where they worked as maids.In late 1933, the trial resulted in the elder sister, Christine, being convicted of both murders and sentenced to death, a  sentence later commuted to that of  life in prison.  She would die four years later in  an asylum for the criminally insane. Her younger sister, Lea, was also convicted, but only of the murder of Madame Lancelin,  and was sentenced to serve ten years of hard labor. She  served eight years of her ten year sentence and was then released, living to a ripe old age.In the film, the viewer sees that the sisters came from a totally dysfunctional household. Their mother, the selfish and unloving Clemence (Isabel Renauld),  kicked her alcoholic husband out the household, when she discovered that he had been molesting their oldest daughter, Emilie. She then placed their three daughters  in a Catholic orphanage run by nuns. Clemence, relieved of the day-to-day responsibility of her daughters, would see them on occasion.Emilie eventually decided to become a nun. When Christine later expressed an interest in following in Emilie's footsteps, her mother quashed that notion. Instead, as Christine (Sylvie Testud) grew older, Clemence looked to her as a source of income, hiring her out to work as a maid. The viewer sees the deadening effect of her servitude, as her employers treat Christine as a virtual nonentity. Initially, Christine tested  the patience of some of her earlier employers to whom she was,  at times, slyly insolent. Later, she resorted to passive-aggressive behavior.As time passes, however, Christine becomes more superficially accepting of her lot in life. Yet, the viewer can see an embittered Christine internalize her resentment, frustration, and dissatisfaction with her situation. Eventually, Christine's relationship with her mother totally  deteriorates, and it is clear that there is little love lost between the two. Consequently, Christine grows up to be a tightly wound young woman, polite, reticent, and quiet, but seething with a strong current of  emotion beneath the surface.After a number of jobs as a maid, Christine finally finds a post with the well-to-do Lincelan family in the town of Le Mans. When Lea (Julie-Marie Parmentier) grows older, Clemence seeks to place her as a maid, as well.  Having vowed that she would always look after her younger sister, Lea, Christine hatches a scheme. Not wanting to be separated from her sister, Christine manipulates her employer and ensures that Lea is placed with her  in the Lincelan home.At first, all seems well, although they find themselves looking for ways of circumventing the pettiness of their employer's frugality towards them. Then, Christine and Lea's relationship begins to change. Eventually, the somewhat dim Lea would come under the total domination of her sister. They would spend all their time together, and their close, sisterly relationship would develop a sexual component, leading to a shocking, incestuous relationship, with Lea always following Christine's lead.One day, Madame Lincelan and her daughter return home unexpectedly, while Christine and Lea are engaged in activities other than their chores. When Christine goes to head them off at the pass, all hell breaks loose, as she takes some pretty extreme action towards them. Lea  joins her in forever silencing the petty despots who had ruled their lives with an iron fist. These whirling dervishes of destruction would show no mercy.This is a very well acted film. Sylvie Testud turns in a bravura performance as the edgy, emotionally repressed, and mentally unbalanced Christine. Julie-Marie Parmentier lends a dewy innocence to the role of Lea. The rest of the cast likewise gives excellent performances. The cinematography is suitably neutral in tone, lending a stark, austere quality to the film. This is a film that will keep the viewer riveted, but in the end it can hardly be said to be enjoyable in the accepted sense, as the emotions that it conjures are so disquieting. Still, this is a deftly directed, well acted film that is certainly worth seeing, especially if one is a true crime aficionado.",4,HYPNOTIC...DEPRESSING...SHOCKING...,1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,4515,"['film', 'tawdry', 'story', 'notorious', 'Papin', 'sisters', 'quite', 'story', 'early', '1933', 'crime', 'dreadful', 'shocking', 'brutality', 'stunned', 'nation', 'France', 'citizens', 'watched', 'horror', 'facts', 'unfolded', 'Papin', 'sisters', 'Christine', 'Lea', 'stood', 'accused', 'savagely', 'murdering', 'employer', 'Madame', 'Lancelin', 'daughter', 'Genevieve', 'household', 'where', 'worked', 'maids.In', 'late', '1933', 'trial', 'resulted', 'elder', 'sister', 'Christine', 'being', 'convicted', 'murders', 'sentenced', 'death', 'sentence', 'later', 'commuted', 'life', 'prison', 'would', 'die', 'four', 'years', 'later', 'asylum', 'criminally', 'insane', 'younger', 'sister', 'Lea', 'was', 'also', 'convicted', 'only', 'murder', 'Madame', 'Lancelin', 'was', 'sentenced', 'serve', 'ten', 'years', 'hard', 'labor', 'served', 'eight', 'years', 'ten', 'year', 'sentence', 'was', 'then', 'released', 'living', 'ripe', 'old', 'film', 'viewer', 'sisters', 'came', 'totally', 'dysfunctional', 'household', 'mother', 'selfish', 'unloving', 'Clemence', 'Isabel', 'Renauld', 'kicked', 'alcoholic', 'husband', 'household', 'when', 'discovered', 'had', 'been', 'molesting', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Emilie', 'then', 'placed', 'three', 'daughters', 'Catholic', 'orphanage', 'run', 'nuns', 'Clemence', 'relieved', 'day-to-day', 'responsibility', 'daughters', 'would', 'see', 'occasion.Emilie', 'eventually', 'decided', 'become', 'nun', 'When', 'Christine', 'later', 'expressed', 'interest', 'following', 'Emilie', 'footsteps', 'mother', 'quashed', 'notion', 'Instead', 'Christine', 'Sylvie', 'Testud', 'grew', 'older', 'Clemence', 'looked', 'source', 'income', 'hiring', 'work', 'maid', 'viewer', 'deadening', 'effect', 'servitude', 'employers', 'treat', 'Christine', 'virtual', 'nonentity', 'Initially', 'Christine', 'tested', 'patience', 'earlier', 'employers', 'whom', 'was', 'times', 'slyly', 'insolent', 'Later', 'resorted', 'passive-aggressive', 'behavior.As', 'time', 'passes', 'however', 'Christine', 'more', 'superficially', 'accepting', 'lot', 'life', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'embittered', 'Christine', 'internalize', 'resentment', 'frustration', 'dissatisfaction', 'situation', 'Eventually', 'Christine', 'relationship', 'mother', 'totally', 'clear', 'little', 'love', 'lost', 'two', 'Consequently', 'Christine', 'up', 'be', 'tightly', 'young', 'woman', 'polite', 'reticent', 'quiet', 'seething', 'strong', 'current', 'emotion', 'surface.After', 'number', 'jobs', 'maid', 'Christine', 'finally', 'post', 'well-to-do', 'Lincelan', 'family', 'town', 'Le', 'Mans', 'When', 'Lea', 'Julie-Marie', 'Parmentier', 'older', 'Clemence', 'place', 'maid', 'as', 'well', 'Having', 'vowed', 'would', 'always', 'look', 'younger', 'sister', 'Lea', 'Christine', 'scheme', 'Not', 'wanting', 'be', 'separated', 'sister', 'Christine', 'employer', 'Lea', 'placed', 'Lincelan', 'home.At', 'first', 'well', 'find', 'looking', 'ways', 'circumventing', 'pettiness', 'employer', 'frugality', 'Then', 'Christine', 'Lea', 'relationship', 'change', 'Eventually', 'somewhat', 'dim', 'Lea', 'would', 'come', 'total', 'domination', 'sister', 'would', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'close', 'sisterly', 'relationship', 'would', 'develop', 'sexual', 'component', 'leading', 'shocking', 'incestuous', 'relationship', 'Lea', 'always', 'following', 'Christine', 'lead.One', 'day', 'Madame', 'Lincelan', 'daughter', 'return', 'home', 'unexpectedly', 'Christine', 'Lea', 'are', 'engaged', 'activities', 'other', 'chores', 'When', 'Christine', 'head', 'off', 'pass', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'pretty', 'extreme', 'action', 'Lea', 'forever', 'silencing', 'petty', 'despots', 'who', 'had', 'ruled', 'lives', 'iron', 'fist', 'whirling', 'dervishes', 'destruction', 'would', 'show', 'mercy.This', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'film', 'Sylvie', 'Testud', 'bravura', 'performance', 'edgy', 'emotionally', 'repressed', 'mentally', 'unbalanced', 'Christine', 'Julie-Marie', 'Parmentier', 'dewy', 'innocence', 'role', 'Lea', 'rest', 'cast', 'likewise', 'excellent', 'performances', 'cinematography', 'suitably', 'neutral', 'tone', 'lending', 'stark', 'austere', 'quality', 'film', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'viewer', 'riveted', 'end', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'said', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'accepted', 'sense', 'emotions', 'are', 'so', 'disquieting', 'Still', 'deftly', 'directed', 'well', 'acted', 'film', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', 'especially', 'one', 'true', 'crime', 'aficionado']",N/A
