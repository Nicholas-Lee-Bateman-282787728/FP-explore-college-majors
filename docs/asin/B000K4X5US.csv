As a previous reviewer mentioned, sometimes the footage is far from perfect...one has to remember that some of these shows are well over 40 years old!  Plus, I seem to remember them as always being a bit rough.  Marlin Perkins was a kind, grandfatherly figure as host.  I think people often forget that he was a bona-fide Zoologist (PhD).As to some of the information from the shows being dated, that is true.  As a previous reviewer mentioned, one has to view them in context.The folks in their 30s,40s, and 50s are probably the best target audience for the shows, although they should appeal to a broader audience.  There is a large nostalgia factor here.As to the presentation, well....this IS a BCI release, after all.  They are not always bastions of great quality DVD releases.  Actually, they didn't do a bad job.  I picked this one up at a discout club for $23.  Not bad for 7 double sided discs and 50-30 minute episodes.(I also complain that the box is rather a poor touch and there is very little documentation included....not even production dates).",4,"Pioneering, Quite Good.",1191801600,"10 8, 2007",2007,1154,"['literally', 'grew', 'up', 'Mutual', 'Omaha', 'WILD', 'KINGDOM', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'show', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'sometimes', 'footage', 'far', 'perfect', 'one', 'remember', 'shows', 'are', 'well', '40', 'years', 'old', 'seem', 'remember', 'always', 'being', 'bit', 'rough', 'Marlin', 'Perkins', 'was', 'kind', 'grandfatherly', 'figure', 'host', 'think', 'people', 'often', 'forget', 'was', 'bona-fide', 'Zoologist', 'PhD', '.As', 'information', 'shows', 'being', 'dated', 'true', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'view', 'context.The', 'folks', '30s,40s', '50s', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'target', 'audience', 'shows', 'should', 'appeal', 'broader', 'audience', 'large', 'nostalgia', 'factor', 'here.As', 'presentation', 'well', '.this', 'BCI', 'release', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'bastions', 'great', 'quality', 'DVD', 'Actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'bad', 'job', 'picked', 'one', 'up', 'discout', 'club', '23', 'Not', 'bad', '7', 'double', 'sided', 'discs', '50-30', 'minute', 'episodes', 'also', 'complain', 'box', 'rather', 'poor', 'touch', 'very', 'little', 'documentation', 'included', '.not', 'even', 'production', 'dates']",Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom: The Definitive 50 Episode Collection
