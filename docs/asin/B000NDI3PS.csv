I remember so many of his earlier movies with the greats like Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn, but this series on TV was so poignant for me.  It was in the early 80's and it was just an exceptional role that Mickey played perfectly.RIP Mickey.  A career that spanned years and years of entertainment.Most highly recommended.",5,~~Mickey as I remember him best~~,1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,392,"['Just', 'learned', 'passing', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'age', '93', 'remember', 'so', 'many', 'earlier', 'movies', 'greats', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'series', 'TV', 'was', 'so', 'poignant', 'was', 'early', '80', 'was', 'just', 'exceptional', 'role', 'Mickey', 'played', 'perfectly.RIP', 'Mickey', 'A', 'career', 'spanned', 'years', 'years', 'entertainment.Most', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Think I paid &lt; $15. I have now had this extraordinary set of films for quite some time, and am just now revisiting. Wow, Mickey Rooney certainly deserved that Emmy! I pretty much have a disdain for most ""made for tv"" movies (I know, there are SOME good ones, ""The Homecoming"" -The Waltons pilot-, for instance, a Christmas classic!), but ""Bill"" (especially first) avoids the insipid writing and trite acting that are so prevalent for modern tv. Indeed, when I was watching the first installment, the 'commercial breaks' (fade to black) were the only indicator -for me- that this was not a theatrical release.

1056371,A37S3ACL57LN62,B000NDI3PS,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[14, 14]","This DVD set is a thrill for fans of the underground favorites Bill and Bill: On His Own. Mickey Rooney is at his best playing the mentally disabled Bill Sackter, a real life friend of the director. For two movies that ran an average of $25 each before this release, this $12 DVD is a real bargain.Bill is absolute sentiment, but with such a fine actor in the leading role, it is difficult not to fall for the baited hook. Mickey Rooney plays Bill, a man whose life has not been easy. He spent almost 50 years in an insane asylum and lives with the threat returning there if he cannot keep himself out of trouble. Bill is extremely innocent and easily taken advantage of, so trouble is not unknown to him. However, a film maker named Barry (Dennis Quaid) takes an interest in him as a subject and becomes his friend.The story is simple, but the plot doesn't have to be complex. Rooney is absolutely fascinating to watch. It is easy to forget he is acting; he makes the character so realistic and very lovable. Of course the editing and the music aid that, but really it is Rooney who pulls through. Quaid is also interesting here too in an early role. Even through his character's frustrations and imperfections, he makes his character notable and interesting.Bill: On His Own is the sequel to Bill. In this second movie, Barry moves to California to start a new career, leaving Bill behind to be a ""good man"" on his own. Bill finds that independence isn't easy, even when he lives with a loving group of people. He finds a potential new friend in student of social work Jenny (Helen Hunt) who pushes Bill to learn to read and count. Her insistance frustrates him and makes him feel like a ""low grade man,"" but her intentions are good.One forgets that Rooney is acting, even though he's a familiar face. Hunt is less likable than Quaid's character is, but she represents a common factor when dealing with the mentally disabled. Teresa Wright also appears as Mae, Bill's guardian. Her face will be familiar to classic movie fans for her appearances in films like The Pride of the Yankees and The Best Years of Our Lives.",5,Excellent Price for Excellent Films,1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,2119,"['DVD', 'set', 'thrill', 'fans', 'underground', 'favorites', 'Bill', 'Bill', 'Own', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'best', 'playing', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'Bill', 'Sackter', 'real', 'life', 'friend', 'director', 'two', 'movies', 'ran', 'average', '25', 'release', '12', 'DVD', 'real', 'bargain.Bill', 'absolute', 'sentiment', 'such', 'fine', 'actor', 'leading', 'role', 'difficult', 'not', 'fall', 'baited', 'hook', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Bill', 'man', 'life', 'not', 'been', 'easy', 'spent', 'almost', '50', 'years', 'insane', 'asylum', 'threat', 'returning', 'there', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'trouble', 'Bill', 'extremely', 'innocent', 'easily', 'taken', 'advantage', 'trouble', 'not', 'unknown', 'However', 'film', 'maker', 'named', 'Barry', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'interest', 'subject', 'friend.The', 'story', 'simple', 'plot', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'complex', 'Rooney', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'easy', 'forget', 'acting', 'character', 'so', 'realistic', 'very', 'lovable', 'course', 'editing', 'music', 'aid', 'really', 'Rooney', 'who', 'Quaid', 'also', 'interesting', 'here', 'too', 'early', 'role', 'Even', 'character', 'frustrations', 'imperfections', 'character', 'notable', 'interesting.Bill', 'Own', 'sequel', 'Bill', 'second', 'movie', 'Barry', 'California', 'start', 'new', 'career', 'leaving', 'Bill', 'be', 'good', 'man', 'own', 'Bill', 'independence', ""n't"", 'easy', 'even', 'when', 'loving', 'group', 'people', 'potential', 'new', 'friend', 'student', 'social', 'work', 'Jenny', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'who', 'Bill', 'learn', 'read', 'count', 'insistance', 'feel', 'low', 'grade', 'man', 'intentions', 'are', 'good.One', 'forgets', 'Rooney', 'acting', 'even', 'familiar', 'face', 'Hunt', 'less', 'likable', 'Quaid', 'character', 'common', 'factor', 'when', 'dealing', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'also', 'Mae', 'Bill', 'guardian', 'face', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'classic', 'movie', 'fans', 'appearances', 'films', 'Pride', 'Yankees', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives']",N/A
