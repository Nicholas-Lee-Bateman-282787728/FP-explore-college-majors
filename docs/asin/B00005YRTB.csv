It brought back the memories of my dad so loving caring for my mom through her cancer and death no matter what others thought.  The main thing we all need to know is that God promises never to leave nor forsake.  We have never been told we won't have to go through, but that He will always be there along side. He can't take over if we don't let Him.  It's a wonderful movie for those in need of faith and for those who only profess to be christians and have faith but don't really know God, and great for those of us who truly love God and cherish reminders of His mercy and grace. It's a must see.",5,For those really willing to trust God,1103155200,"12 16, 2004",2004,664,"['just', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'moved', 'great', 'tears', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'dad', 'so', 'loving', 'caring', 'mom', 'cancer', 'death', 'matter', 'what', 'others', 'thought', 'main', 'thing', 'need', 'know', 'God', 'never', 'leave', 'forsake', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'told', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'go', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'there', 'along', 'side', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'over', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'Him', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'need', 'faith', 'who', 'only', 'profess', 'be', 'christians', 'have', 'faith', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'God', 'great', 'who', 'truly', 'love', 'God', 'cherish', 'reminders', 'mercy', 'grace', 'must', 'see']",N/A
