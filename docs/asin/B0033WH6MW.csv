1320368,AKV1L9JL3L5TS,B0033WH6MW,"D. Bisciglia ""Swerd Murd""","[0, 1]","I cannot say enough positive things about this show.I caught it on Starz one night completely at random...I remember thinking ""Party Down?  What a stupid title....oh well let's give it a shot"".27 minutes later, I set my DVR to record every episode of the show.  1 day later, I cracked and downloaded the entirety of the series.  By the time my DVR had caught the next episode on Starz, I'd already seen the entire backlog of the series.To date, I've probably watched every episode in both seasons 20+ times, and I still continue to watch it.  It's that good.The comedic timing is the stuff of legends, and the ensemble cast is absolutely stellar.  Most critical reviews praise Jane Lynch as the main draw of the show...and I'm not gonna say she's bad (Jane is always great)...but she has the smallest role of any of the main recurring characters and is in no way the star of the show.  Every character is unique, a joy to behold, and compelling in a way you won't understand until you actually watch the show.Henry's constant sarcasm and general disdain for his working life makes him very, very identifiable.  We've all been Henry at a job before.  Roman's complete apathy for the entire rest of the world, sullen demeanor, and nerd-atop-an-ivory-tower personality makes him one of my absolute favorites.  Kyle is also loads of fun, filling the role of the airheadded emo jerk who always gets girls...somehow.  The banter between Kyle and Roman is unbelievable entertaining.  Constance (Lynch) is a crazy has-been pseudo-porn actress that's sort of a grown up female Kyle...as I mentioned previously, she's not featured too prevalently, but she has some of the best lines in the entire show.  Then we have Casey--the love interest, and one of those women who makes you angry that real-life women don't seem to share her personality.  She is just plain cool--flawed enough to be human, but a great counterpoint to Henry's dry hilarity.  It also helps that she's gorgeous (Lizzie Kaplan, the actress, is beautiful).Then we have Ron.  I'd say if I had to choose, Ron is the main draw of this show.  He's that boss that takes his crappy job way too seriously, and he's probably the most believable-yet-hilarious member of the cast.  Without spoiling any of his ""Ron moments"" I don't think I've ever heard anyone say ""No"" in so many hilarious ways....watch the end of episode 4, season 1, and you'll see what I mean.You need to watch this show.  If you're a fan of the somewhat tame American sitcoms like The Office or Community, this show will immediately convert you and probably kill your enjoyment of said series.If you're a fan of crap like 30 Rock...well...this show doesn't need your viewership :)  Go watch Tina Fey induce sleep with her atrocious comedic timing and Tracy Morgan...make noises he thinks sound like words... and pretend you have a decent sense of humor.",5,Possibly the best comedy series ever made.,1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,2873,"['can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'positive', 'things', 'show.I', 'caught', 'Starz', 'one', 'night', 'completely', 'random', 'remember', 'thinking', 'Party', 'Down', 'What', 'stupid', 'title', '.oh', 'well', 'let', 'give', 'shot', '.27', 'minutes', 'later', 'set', 'DVR', 'record', 'episode', 'show', '1', 'day', 'later', 'cracked', 'downloaded', 'entirety', 'series', 'time', 'DVR', 'had', 'caught', 'next', 'episode', 'Starz', ""'d"", 'already', 'seen', 'entire', 'backlog', 'series.To', 'date', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'watched', 'episode', 'seasons', '20+', 'times', 'still', 'continue', 'watch', 'good.The', 'comedic', 'timing', 'stuff', 'legends', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'absolutely', 'stellar', 'Most', 'critical', 'reviews', 'praise', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'main', 'draw', 'show', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'na', 'say', 'bad', 'Jane', 'always', 'great', 'smallest', 'role', 'main', 'recurring', 'characters', 'way', 'star', 'show', 'character', 'unique', 'joy', 'behold', 'compelling', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'actually', 'watch', 'show.Henry', 'constant', 'sarcasm', 'general', 'disdain', 'working', 'life', 'very', 'very', 'identifiable', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Henry', 'job', 'Roman', 'complete', 'apathy', 'entire', 'rest', 'world', 'sullen', 'demeanor', 'nerd-atop-an-ivory-tower', 'personality', 'one', 'absolute', 'favorites', 'Kyle', 'also', 'loads', 'fun', 'filling', 'role', 'airheadded', 'emo', 'jerk', 'who', 'always', 'girls', 'somehow', 'banter', 'Kyle', 'Roman', 'unbelievable', 'entertaining', 'Constance', 'Lynch', 'crazy', 'has-been', 'pseudo-porn', 'actress', 'sort', 'grown', 'up', 'female', 'Kyle', 'mentioned', 'previously', 'not', 'featured', 'too', 'prevalently', 'best', 'lines', 'entire', 'show', 'Then', 'have', 'Casey', 'love', 'interest', 'one', 'women', 'who', 'angry', 'real-life', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'share', 'personality', 'just', 'plain', 'cool', 'flawed', 'enough', 'be', 'human', 'great', 'counterpoint', 'Henry', 'dry', 'hilarity', 'also', 'gorgeous', 'Lizzie', 'Kaplan', 'actress', 'beautiful', '.Then', 'have', 'Ron', ""'d"", 'say', 'had', 'choose', 'Ron', 'main', 'draw', 'show', 'boss', 'crappy', 'job', 'way', 'too', 'seriously', 'probably', 'most', 'believable-yet-hilarious', 'member', 'cast', 'spoiling', 'Ron', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'anyone', 'say', 'No', 'so', 'many', 'hilarious', 'ways', '.watch', 'end', 'episode', '4', 'season', '1', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean.You', 'need', 'watch', 'show', ""'re"", 'fan', 'somewhat', 'tame', 'American', 'sitcoms', 'Office', 'Community', 'show', 'will', 'immediately', 'convert', 'probably', 'kill', 'enjoyment', 'said', 'series.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'crap', '30', 'Rock', 'well', 'show', ""n't"", 'need', 'viewership', 'Go', 'watch', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'induce', 'sleep', 'atrocious', 'comedic', 'timing', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'make', 'noises', 'sound', 'words', 'pretend', 'have', 'decent', 'sense', 'humor']",N/A

I never have or will see the new 90210; hell, I only ever saw fifteen or twenty minutes if the original.  Party Down, on the other hand, is a real fun and funny show.  PD presents us with a broad range of characters and situations rife with comedic (not to mention humiliatingly uncomfortable) potential.  The characters are exactly the sort of people you might expect to find working for a Hollywood caterer: hasbeens and wannabes.  With Henry and Casey, the writers even managed to toss in a bit of a non-contrived romantic subplot a la Pam and Jim from The Office.

It's difficult to analyze what makes it so good, but though the characters are all shallow, selfish wannabes, the show has a heart to it, it's not 100 per cent cold.  American sitcoms have been focused on the workplace for the past thirty or forty years (like Cheers or Mary Tyler Moore), but most of them attempt to warm up their characters by presenting them at home.  The new breed of workplace sitcoms doesn't even try to humanize the characters that much and I don't believe any of the ten episodes of Season One of Party Down shows us the homelife of any of the characters.  Maybe it's cheaper that way I guess, not having to build, say, the crummy apartment Henry must live in, or the condo owned by Ron complete with artists' renditions of his planned ""Soup `R' Crackers"" franchise.But the lack of relief does lead to some unsavory plot twists, for none of the characters have sex at home, right, they're always going at it in public bathrooms or swimming pools or party corners.In a way this is the perfect show for the economic downturn in which few of us can afford to live by ourselves any more.What can I say about Party Down's main actors, besides to say, they are all great,  At first Ryan Hansen's deadpan turned me off, but I got into his stupidity in a big way long before the series came to an end.  Jane Lynch's optimism and cheer are a nice contrast for the malice she shows as Sue Sylvester.  I like Adam Scott and Lizzy Caplan, though they're no Jim and Pam--and Adam Scott must be about, what, four feet eleven?  He's so tiny I don't know how they found a pink bow tie small enough for his neck, maybe they got it from a doll.  Ken Marino is really the star of the show, while Martin Starr is viciously geeky as Roman, the frustrated writer who hates fantasy and just loves hard science fiction.  The guest stars must have loved coming on the show, they are all brilliantly deployed, showing angles denied them in their regular roles I suppose.

Henry is a guy who had a little fame but who has given up his Hollywood dream to work for a caterer.  He has no idea what he wants to do next.  All the other characters have strong personalities and clear motives.  But not Henry.  Perhaps the show creators thought he could be the level-headed and normal center around which the rest of the cast could orbit.  They did.  But he ultimately kept the show from developing a tension between the themes of failure and success.  The show is about trying to make it in Hollywood while at the bottom of the food chain.  Henry should have had an emotional investment in that struggle--from the beginning.  The creators played it cute and lost.My heart really goes out to the people who made this show.  Aside for that one problem with the central character (and who knows, it might have worked with a more traditionally handsome actor) the show is first-rate all the way.  It started out well and kept getting better.  Losing Jane Lynch was not a problem.  Indeed, if they had a strong central character, they could have found a great mix with their existing or future actors.I predict the show's creators will go on to make a killer show.

It's not cliched, it doesn't rely totally on broad humor and the characters are believable. Jane Lynch plays against type in the first season (she had to leave in season 2 except for the incredible final wedding episode) in that she plays a happy, non-domineering woman and she hits it out of the park. The interaction between all the characters is great, particularly between Adam Scott and Lizzy Caplan, who seem made for each other. Martin Starr plays the most convincing scifi geek I've ever seen - with force and malice - and Ryan Hansen plays dim handsome act very well (something hard to do excellently, easy to do in a mediocre way). Ken Marino is incredibly goofy and steals most of the scenes. June Daphne Raphael and Kristen Bell play great characters well too.",5,"Incredibly funny, great comedy series",1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,1112,"['What', 'do', 'get', 'when', 'mix', 'great', 'writing', 'great', 'cast', 'chemistry', 'get', 'Party', 'Down', 'series', 'had', 'low', 'ratings', 'existed', 'earlier', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'roared', 'popularity', 'Seinfeld', ""'d"", 'put', 'comedy', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'Seinfeld', 'British', 'Office', 'funniest', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'TV', 'not', 'cliched', ""n't"", 'rely', 'totally', 'broad', 'humor', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'type', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'leave', 'season', '2', 'incredible', 'final', 'wedding', 'episode', 'happy', 'non-domineering', 'woman', 'park', 'interaction', 'characters', 'great', 'particularly', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', 'who', 'seem', 'made', 'other', 'Martin', 'Starr', 'most', 'convincing', 'scifi', 'geek', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'force', 'malice', 'Ryan', 'Hansen', 'dim', 'handsome', 'act', 'very', 'well', 'something', 'hard', 'do', 'excellently', 'easy', 'do', 'mediocre', 'way', 'Ken', 'Marino', 'incredibly', 'goofy', 'steals', 'most', 'scenes', 'June', 'Daphne', 'Raphael', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'play', 'great', 'characters', 'well', 'too']",N/A
