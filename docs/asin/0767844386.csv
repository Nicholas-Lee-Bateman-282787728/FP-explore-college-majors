22000,ARA48345JZPZR,0767844386,Archmaker,"[7, 7]","Casting is sometimes everything, and in this sentimental tale it is the actors playing the Old Master and the little girl that make it all worthwhile.  Exquisitely filmed with the period (1930's China)details just right, the story of an old Master of the Mask-changing art wanting to find a boy apprentice to pass the secrets of his craft on to, who is fooled into paying for a little girl disguised as a boy, and the problems that ensue in that relationship when her true gender is discovered, is bitter/sweet and in the end heart-warming.As I said the actors playing the Old Master and the young girl are simply marvelous.  Wonderful faces, wonderful performances.  Also to be noted is the actor playing the female impersonator Opera star.  It is these performances that make the film work even when it begins to stretch the sentimentality and credibility a bit at the end.  By then you shouldn't mind because you should be caught up in their drama and care for these characters.A simple, nicely told tale, that also demonstrates the harshness of the social contract in the 30's in China and everywhere.  You were on your own.  And that harshness still exists in many places in the world.  Another reviewer has explained some of the reasons for the Old Master's (and the culture's) insistence on passing on the craft to a male heir.  But, that aside, it was a hard world for little girls without family.  And it is a reminder in these times of how harsh a culture can be that does not value women.That one can learn that value is best placed where the heart is, is not a bad lesson to remember anytime.  Beats the hell out of 90% of the drivel coming out of Hollywood. 4 1/2 stars.",4,Wonderfully Played,1007596800,"12 6, 2001",2001,1683,"['Casting', 'sometimes', 'everything', 'sentimental', 'tale', 'actors', 'playing', 'Old', 'Master', 'little', 'girl', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'Exquisitely', 'filmed', 'period', '1930', 'China', 'details', 'just', 'right', 'story', 'old', 'Master', 'Mask-changing', 'art', 'wanting', 'find', 'boy', 'apprentice', 'pass', 'secrets', 'craft', 'who', 'fooled', 'paying', 'little', 'girl', 'disguised', 'boy', 'problems', 'ensue', 'relationship', 'when', 'true', 'gender', 'discovered', 'bitter/sweet', 'end', 'heart-warming.As', 'said', 'actors', 'playing', 'Old', 'Master', 'young', 'girl', 'are', 'simply', 'marvelous', 'Wonderful', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Also', 'be', 'noted', 'actor', 'playing', 'female', 'impersonator', 'Opera', 'star', 'performances', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'even', 'when', 'stretch', 'sentimentality', 'credibility', 'bit', 'end', 'then', 'should', ""n't"", 'mind', 'should', 'be', 'caught', 'up', 'drama', 'care', 'characters.A', 'simple', 'nicely', 'told', 'tale', 'also', 'harshness', 'social', 'contract', '30', 'China', 'everywhere', 'were', 'own', 'harshness', 'still', 'many', 'places', 'world', 'reviewer', 'explained', 'reasons', 'Old', 'Master', 'culture', 'insistence', 'passing', 'craft', 'male', 'heir', 'aside', 'was', 'hard', 'world', 'little', 'girls', 'family', 'reminder', 'times', 'how', 'harsh', 'culture', 'can', 'be', 'not', 'value', 'one', 'can', 'learn', 'value', 'best', 'placed', 'where', 'heart', 'not', 'bad', 'lesson', 'remember', 'anytime', 'Beats', 'hell', '90', '%', 'drivel', 'coming', 'Hollywood', '4', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A

22004,A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ,0767844386,Chris Fung,"[114, 117]","This is a wonderfully intelligent and heart-warming work. I thoroughly thoroughly recommend it.  Set in a beautifully-evoked Sichuan province (watch for guest appearances by the Giant Buddha of Emei Shan) in China during the 1930s, Wu Tianming&#8217;s beautifully delineated movie tells the story of Wang Bianlian, played by the veteran Xu Zhu, an aging street performer who buys a young boy, Gou-er (translated as &#8220;Doggie&#8221; in the subtitles).  Gou-er (luminously portrayed by an absolutely fabulous Zhou Renying) is to be Old Wang's heir as the old man seeks to pass on his family secrets as a master of &#8220;changing face&#8221; theater.This situation needs a little explaining for modern western audiences.  Many times in Chinese history there were awful famines or economic depressions where families faced starvation and destitution. This was particularly true in the late Republican period when civil war added yet another level of problems for ordinary Chinese people.  In these circumstances, desperate families sometimes resorted to selling some or all of their children to wealthy families.  Often these children would be brought up as virtual slaves, especially if they were girls.Gou-er is a pet name.  Chinese children were often given these names instead of real ones until they were old enough to be fairly assured of living to be adults.  This practice stemmed from the folk belief that the lurking demons that populated the Chinese landscape (particularly in natural areas such as rivers, woods and mountains) would be fooled into thinking that the child was worthless if their family referred to them as &#8220;Stinky&#8221; or &#8220;Idiot&#8221; &#8211;or &#8220;Little Dog&#8221;, and so would not attempt to steal the child or kill it.Old Wang needs a boy because according to Confucian tradition, he cannot pass the knowledge on to a girl since daughters or grand daughters were not considered to be permanent members of one&#8217;s family in traditional Chinese society.  Women were brought up to be married out to other families.  The men were the ones who stayed within the family and maintained the family resources.  Usually this meant land for peasants, but for the rich it meant wealth and for performers like Old Wang, it meant the secrets of the trade.  For this reason, I must take issue with Laura Mirsky's editorial review which infers that the famous cross-dressing opera star Luo Sulan (ably played by Zhang Zhigang) was unsuitable as an heir because he portrayed women on stage.While it is true that Chinese society is conventionally very homophobic, and Luo Sulan is certainly portrayed as a rather effeminate young man, the larger obstacle (and this is important since it is another example of Confucian tradition at work) was that Luo was not a member of Old Wang&#8217;s family.  &#8220;Changing face&#8221; was a family tradition and could not be handed on to anyone who was an outsider. Luo&#8217;s status as a man who plays women on stage would not have been an issue in and of itself since this was the norm in Chinese opera of the time.  As in Shakespearean England, women were not allowed to perform as actors so all the female roles were played by men (see also the wonderful Chen Kaige movie &#8220;Farewell My Concubine&#8221;).This movie deals with issues of family, loyalty, love and tradition.  It is an overt critique of traditional Chinese society but is also a pointed (though gentle) indictment of the resurgence of some of these Confucian values in modern China following the economic boom of the eighties and nineties...",5,Witty and charming but watch out for the sting!,989712000,"05 13, 2001",2001,3593,"['wonderfully', 'intelligent', 'heart-warming', 'work', 'thoroughly', 'thoroughly', 'recommend', 'Set', 'beautifully-evoked', 'Sichuan', 'province', 'watch', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Giant', 'Buddha', 'Emei', 'Shan', 'China', '1930s', 'Wu', 'Tianming', '8217', 'beautifully', 'delineated', 'movie', 'story', 'Wang', 'Bianlian', 'played', 'veteran', 'Xu', 'Zhu', 'aging', 'street', 'performer', 'who', 'buys', 'young', 'boy', 'Gou-er', 'translated', '8220', 'Doggie', '8221', 'subtitles', 'Gou-er', 'luminously', 'portrayed', 'absolutely', 'fabulous', 'Zhou', 'Renying', 'be', 'Old', 'Wang', 'heir', 'old', 'man', 'pass', 'family', 'secrets', 'master', '8220', 'changing', 'face', '8221', 'situation', 'little', 'explaining', 'modern', 'western', 'audiences', 'Many', 'times', 'Chinese', 'history', 'were', 'awful', 'famines', 'economic', 'depressions', 'where', 'families', 'faced', 'starvation', 'destitution', 'was', 'particularly', 'true', 'late', 'Republican', 'period', 'when', 'civil', 'war', 'added', 'yet', 'level', 'problems', 'ordinary', 'Chinese', 'people', 'circumstances', 'desperate', 'families', 'sometimes', 'resorted', 'selling', 'children', 'wealthy', 'families', 'children', 'would', 'be', 'brought', 'up', 'virtual', 'slaves', 'especially', 'were', 'girls.Gou-er', 'pet', 'name', 'Chinese', 'children', 'were', 'often', 'given', 'names', 'instead', 'real', 'ones', 'were', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'fairly', 'assured', 'living', 'be', 'adults', 'practice', 'stemmed', 'folk', 'belief', 'lurking', 'demons', 'populated', 'Chinese', 'landscape', 'particularly', 'natural', 'areas', 'such', 'rivers', 'woods', 'mountains', 'would', 'be', 'fooled', 'thinking', 'child', 'was', 'worthless', 'family', 'referred', '8220', 'Stinky', '8221', '8220', 'Idiot', '8221', '8211', '8220', 'Little', 'Dog', '8221', 'so', 'would', 'not', 'attempt', 'steal', 'child', 'kill', 'it.Old', 'Wang', 'boy', 'according', 'Confucian', 'tradition', 'can', 'not', 'pass', 'knowledge', 'girl', 'daughters', 'grand', 'daughters', 'were', 'not', 'considered', 'be', 'permanent', 'members', 'one', '8217', 's', 'family', 'traditional', 'Chinese', 'society', 'Women', 'were', 'brought', 'up', 'be', 'married', 'other', 'families', 'men', 'were', 'ones', 'who', 'stayed', 'family', 'maintained', 'family', 'resources', 'Usually', 'meant', 'land', 'peasants', 'rich', 'meant', 'wealth', 'performers', 'Old', 'Wang', 'meant', 'secrets', 'trade', 'reason', 'must', 'take', 'issue', 'Laura', 'Mirsky', 'editorial', 'review', 'famous', 'cross-dressing', 'opera', 'star', 'Luo', 'Sulan', 'ably', 'played', 'Zhang', 'Zhigang', 'was', 'unsuitable', 'heir', 'portrayed', 'women', 'stage.While', 'true', 'Chinese', 'society', 'conventionally', 'very', 'homophobic', 'Luo', 'Sulan', 'certainly', 'portrayed', 'rather', 'effeminate', 'young', 'man', 'larger', 'obstacle', 'important', 'example', 'Confucian', 'tradition', 'work', 'was', 'Luo', 'was', 'not', 'member', 'Old', 'Wang', '8217', 's', 'family', '8220', 'Changing', 'face', '8221', 'was', 'family', 'tradition', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'handed', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'outsider', 'Luo', '8217', 's', 'status', 'man', 'who', 'women', 'stage', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'issue', 'was', 'norm', 'Chinese', 'opera', 'time', 'Shakespearean', 'England', 'women', 'were', 'not', 'allowed', 'perform', 'actors', 'female', 'roles', 'were', 'played', 'men', 'see', 'also', 'wonderful', 'Chen', 'Kaige', 'movie', '8220', 'Farewell', 'My', 'Concubine', '8221', '.This', 'movie', 'deals', 'issues', 'family', 'loyalty', 'love', 'tradition', 'overt', 'critique', 'traditional', 'Chinese', 'society', 'also', 'pointed', 'gentle', 'indictment', 'resurgence', 'Confucian', 'values', 'modern', 'China', 'following', 'economic', 'boom', 'eighties', 'nineties']",N/A

See the dvdbeaver review for a comparison.The good news is that the Mei-Ah disc is sometimes available on Amazon -- check with the seller first, as there are several Asian releases of this film! -- and when it is, it's always considerably less expensive than the Sony version.Three stars for the Sony, based on the slice-n-dice, four for the Mei-Ah, based on the relatively poor transfer and distracting subtitling.

Bestick,"[8, 8]","The King of Masks is a heartwarming fable set in depression era Sichuan province that makes some sharp points about China's current policies and cultural practices.The King of masks is Wang Bianlian (Xu Shu), a master practitioner of ""changing face"" theatre, part performance art and part magic show.  His sleight-of-hand street theater dazzles Liang (Zhang Zhigang), a famous opera performer renowned for playing female leads.  (At the time, all the male and female roles in opera companies were played by men.)  Liang offers to bring Wang Bianlian into his opera troupe, and pay him handsomely as long as he agrees to teach Liang his mask tricks.  Although he's barely scraping by, Wang Bianlian refuses, partly because he believes such a move will betray the purity of his art, and because he can only pass on his craft to a male member of his own family.His only son has died, and Wang Bianlian's one big desire is to find another male heir.  It has to be a male by the rules of his guild and by the practices of Confucian society, which viewed females as attached to the family they married into, not the family they were born into.  He feels his prayers have been answered when he buys a young boy being sold by a poor peasant, something that apparently happened with sad regularity during hard economic times.  The King is smitten with his adopted son (Zhou Renying, who will melt your heart) and is looking forward to teaching him the tricks of his trade until the day he finds out, to his shock and dismay, that ""Doggie"" as his son is affectionately called, is lacking ""a little teaspout.""Doggie goes from being the beloved heir to a poorly treated servant girl.  She's no longer allowed to call the King ""Grandfather,"" only ""boss.""  Doggie works hard in her fallen state to earn the King's respect.  When she brings a young boy she has rescured back to their sampan to be the King's new son and heir, the King is delighted, until he's arrested for kidnapping.  Languishing in his cell, facing what looks like certain execution, Wang Bianlian sees that he's wanted the wrong thing, and wanted it too much.  He only hopes he gets the chance to make amends to Doggie in this lifetime.Director Wu Tianming, without preaching, is taking direct aim at modern China's one child per family policy and the cultural preference for boy children over girls.  Rural families, desperate like Wang Bianlian for a male heir, have murdered their infant daughters or abandoned them in public places, leaving them to be raised in orphanages or worse.  (The demographic consequences of this practice will soon be felt: a large cadre of sexually frustrated little emperors competing for too few mates.)  Any society that devalues a large part of its population, the way America did with its African American citizens or the way France does with its Muslim citizens, cannot be considered an enlightened society.  The King of Masks, besides being a well-made, heartwarming movie, is a plea for China to see the worth in all its citizens, no matter what mask Confucian or Communist or Capitalist society forces them to wear.",4,"Warm Tale,  Urgent Message",1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,3110,"['King', 'Masks', 'heartwarming', 'fable', 'set', 'depression', 'era', 'Sichuan', 'province', 'sharp', 'points', 'China', 'current', 'policies', 'cultural', 'practices.The', 'King', 'masks', 'Wang', 'Bianlian', 'Xu', 'Shu', 'master', 'practitioner', 'changing', 'face', 'theatre', 'part', 'performance', 'art', 'part', 'magic', 'show', 'sleight-of-hand', 'street', 'theater', 'dazzles', 'Liang', 'Zhang', 'Zhigang', 'famous', 'opera', 'performer', 'renowned', 'playing', 'female', 'leads', 'time', 'male', 'female', 'roles', 'opera', 'companies', 'were', 'played', 'men', 'Liang', 'offers', 'bring', 'Wang', 'Bianlian', 'opera', 'troupe', 'pay', 'handsomely', 'as', 'long', 'teach', 'Liang', 'mask', 'tricks', 'barely', 'scraping', 'Wang', 'Bianlian', 'partly', 'move', 'will', 'betray', 'purity', 'art', 'can', 'only', 'pass', 'craft', 'male', 'member', 'own', 'family.His', 'only', 'son', 'died', 'Wang', 'Bianlian', 'one', 'big', 'desire', 'find', 'male', 'heir', 'be', 'male', 'rules', 'guild', 'practices', 'Confucian', 'society', 'viewed', 'females', 'attached', 'family', 'married', 'not', 'family', 'were', 'born', 'prayers', 'have', 'been', 'answered', 'when', 'young', 'boy', 'being', 'sold', 'poor', 'peasant', 'something', 'apparently', 'happened', 'sad', 'regularity', 'hard', 'economic', 'times', 'King', 'smitten', 'adopted', 'son', 'Zhou', 'Renying', 'who', 'will', 'melt', 'heart', 'looking', 'forward', 'teaching', 'tricks', 'trade', 'day', 'out', 'shock', 'dismay', 'Doggie', 'son', 'affectionately', 'called', 'lacking', 'little', 'teaspout', 'Doggie', 'being', 'beloved', 'heir', 'poorly', 'treated', 'servant', 'girl', 'longer', 'allowed', 'call', 'King', 'Grandfather', 'only', 'boss', 'Doggie', 'hard', 'fallen', 'state', 'earn', 'King', 'respect', 'When', 'young', 'boy', 'rescured', 'back', 'sampan', 'be', 'King', 'new', 'son', 'heir', 'King', 'delighted', 'arrested', 'kidnapping', 'Languishing', 'cell', 'facing', 'what', 'certain', 'execution', 'Wang', 'Bianlian', 'wanted', 'wrong', 'thing', 'wanted', 'too', 'much', 'only', 'chance', 'make', 'amends', 'Doggie', 'lifetime.Director', 'Wu', 'Tianming', 'preaching', 'taking', 'direct', 'aim', 'modern', 'China', 'one', 'child', 'family', 'policy', 'cultural', 'preference', 'boy', 'children', 'girls', 'Rural', 'families', 'desperate', 'Wang', 'Bianlian', 'male', 'heir', 'have', 'murdered', 'infant', 'daughters', 'abandoned', 'public', 'places', 'leaving', 'be', 'raised', 'orphanages', 'worse', 'demographic', 'consequences', 'practice', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'felt', 'large', 'cadre', 'sexually', 'frustrated', 'little', 'emperors', 'competing', 'too', 'few', 'mates', 'society', 'large', 'part', 'population', 'way', 'America', 'did', 'African', 'American', 'citizens', 'way', 'France', 'Muslim', 'citizens', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'considered', 'enlightened', 'society', 'King', 'Masks', 'being', 'well-made', 'heartwarming', 'movie', 'plea', 'China', 'see', 'worth', 'citizens', 'matter', 'what', 'Confucian', 'Communist', 'Capitalist', 'society', 'forces', 'wear']",N/A

22021,A3O6WZS3VO5NK5,0767844386,jblack,"[4, 7]","A wonderful movie that accurately portrays some of the issues concerning the important of being male in China, The Middle Kingdom. Following is a little synopsis I wrote concerning the inequality between males and females in China. I hope this helps shed a different perspective on the movie. Enjoy!China has long had a patriarchal society, where the female population suffers blatant discrimination as a lower class of human existence. The King of Masks portrays this disparity between the sexes in The Middle Kingdom through the story of the last remaining master of face-changing opera who is searching for a male heir to whom he can pass his family secrets of the specialized art. When rendering the subtle plot into focus through a lens that questions the country's priorities in terms of values, two scenes stand out that demonstrate an emphasis to preserve the traditional order of masculine hierarchies.Scanning the orphanage for a potential student and future heir of his unique training, the King of Masks is confronted by potential sellers trying to rid themselves of unwanted children--most of whom are female and therefore considered relatively useless. In fact, at one point, when one of the sellers is begging the King of Masks to take a little girl the master refuses to acknowledge the woman's pleas, even when she drops her price to a measly two dollars. At one-fifth the original price, the King of Masks quietly scoffs that no girl would be worth that amount of fortune. Yet, as soon as a boy cries out, ""Grandpa,"" the King of Masks appears near tears at the thought of having an heir finally. Gladly he pays the two dollars and takes the boy home, hand in hand. This scene introduces the audience to inequality between the perceived to be useless females and the ruling males in the Chinese society. By only valuing the male's ability to pass on the family name and honor, the prioritization of preserving the masculine hierarchies is reinforced.A little while later, another scene emerges and complicates the plot, while further pointing to the importance of masculine dominance in the society. The King of Masks has been doting on the newly adopted young boy and could not be happier. However, one afternoon the master's leg is cut badly at a street competition and asks the boy to pee on the wound, while he mixes the ashes of a burning cloth. This, the King claims, is an effective remedy that will help stop the bleeding and aid in the healing process. Yet, the boy refuses and after continual forceful pleading from his master he begins to cry and finally yells out, ""I can't, because I am a girl."" Horrified, the master recoils and his eyes turn a steely gray as he comes to terms with the fact that he has been betrayed. The once beloved child now becomes a thief and deceiver in the mind of the Kind of Masks--worthy of a miserable life alone. Begging not to be abandoned, the girl offers to be a slave of the master, cleaning the boat and preparing his food along with any other tasks that he would wish of her. With the changing roles from honored to damned, the point is painfully clear that the proper order in Chinese society dictates that men rule and are valued, while women are to be slaves and viewed as a burden.These two scenes vividly show the priority in The Middle Kingdom of preserving the traditional masculine hierarchies and the proper male order.

22023,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0767844386,Linda Linguvic,"[9, 9]","This 1996 Chinese film captured my heart from the very beginning.  It's set in China in the 1930s, when street performing and Chinese opera were still considered an art.  An old man performs with masks, an ancient Chinese art of which he is very proud.  By family tradition, he must pass on his art to a male heir and, since his only son had died many years before, he needs to adopt a young boy.  And so he goes to a ""baby market"" where parents and slave traders sell children.  When an 8-year old calls out ""grandpa"", he purchases the child. It is only a few days later that he discovers that he has adopted a girl, not a boy.  She begs him not to cast her away, and so he trains her to be a street performer, but does not teach her the art of masks because she is only a girl.The plot gets more complex and held me captive with emotion as I was swept into the story and completely identified with the characters and all their problems, especially after the old man and the girl attend a Chinese opera, where female impersonators are stars. There, the ancient story of a woman sacrificing herself for her father is played out in highly dramatic costumed theatrics.I loved this film - not only for the wonderful story and great acting, but it brought me right into the heart of China and let me immerse myself in another time and place. Yes, there is a happy ending, but not until there were more twists and turns of the plot and I never knew how it would all turn out. Acting was outstanding and I must applaud the actors, Yu Zhu as the old man, Zhigang Zhang as the female impersonator and - mostly, Renying Zhou as the little girl.  Rarely have I seen such a fine performance by an 8-year old.  Therefore, this film gets one of my highest recommendations.

In 1930's China, only males are deemed worthy of this inheritance and Wang has none (you learn why later in the film). He lives in poverty on his houseboat traveling from city to city in Sichuan along the river. He is proud of the fact he has never asked for money but always supported himself. A famous female impersonator (only men were allowed to perform so all women's roles were male impersonators) opera star is impressed with his art and becomes his friend and encourages him to find a son, so that his art will not die with him, even offering to partner with him and split the take if Wang will teach him the art but custom was that only a family member could inherit this craft. Wang goes into the black market to find a son. There are many girls for sale (nobody's buying them) and even being given away but he's looking for a son. He finds one and pays top dollar for him only to find out later that he should have checked all the parts because he has a daughter not a son. He is enraged and distraught at having been deceived. The rest of the story plays out what happens between him and 'Doggie', his daughter that he tries to disown, along with a few surprises thrown in. It apparently is based on a true story and gives you a wonderful look at China and its people and geography. Except for brief language this is a family film and children will love 'Doggie' and her struggle to survive in a male dominated world.

His own son died tragically. So the King of Masks goes on the look for a boy to call his grandson to pass on his art to. He finds one... or so he thinks. It turns out the little boy he bought (Doggie) is really a little girl who has fooled him. But you can tell Doggie didn't want to fool the King of Masks. She began to really love him. When he finds out Doggie is a girl it is heartbreaking to watch him leave her behind only to turn around, get her back, and tell her ""never call me grandpa... I am BOSS"".

Even through all the tragedy I knew that everything would turn out alright in the end. It was fairly predictable.The characters were very likeable. Wang was a very endearing man, and Doggie was the cutest thing. But I don't think the film expanded enough on their relationship. In fact at one point I was unclear whether Wang had kicked the girl out, or she had run away.There were times, also, when the story felt rushed, and some ends were left loose.
