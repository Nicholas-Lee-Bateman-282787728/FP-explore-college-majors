1559985,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B008JFUORW,DanD,"[1, 2]","I didn't expect to enjoy THE HANGOVER PART III.  The first film rocked me out of my socks; it was a sucker-punch to the gut in a world or predictably tame non-Judd Apatow comedy, featuring a cast of relative unknowns partaking in hard-R shenanigans.  Then PART II came out...and it was the exact same thing.  The exact. Same. Thing.  Not in a good way.  So I had low expectations for the third.Perhaps that plays in a role in why I enjoyed it so much.  You have to know what to expect; series rarely get better as they pan out.  Still, Todd Philips and company do something very interesting in PART III: they divert from their tried-and-true method.  Oh, we still have our three best friends on a wild goose chase, with perennial luckless schmuck Doug MIA.  But this time, the story comes with a unique twist: instead of trying to find Doug, the guys are trying to find their friend/nemesis Chow, thanks to a brutal drug dealer (John Goodman doing his spot-on thug thang).  This creates more of a heist comedy (a dark one, too; it's still hard-R), and injects a small dose of unpredictability into the mix.The cast is still strong.  Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zack Galifianakis (who was kind of cloying in PART II; too much of a good thing, perhaps) hold the fort.  As Chow, Ken Jeong is surprisingly enjoyable.  In the first film, he was great, since his role was small; in the second, his part felt like a contrived rehash of better days.  Here, despite his more prominent role, Chow is surprisingly not annoying (well, not too much so), and his chemistry with the rest of the cast is great.  Throw in a great Melissa McCarthy cameo, and you've got the makings of a funny, funny film.  Suffice it to say, HANGOVER PART III isn't quite on the same level as the first...but it's a far cry from the laughless depravity of the second, and is sure to delight fans who are hoping the series will end on a strong (or at least not thoroughly disappointing) note.

I dreaded another more ratcheted up version of the classic original, which was basically the case forPart II.  Instead, THE HANGOVER PART III has a delightfully original plot, pays subtle homage to both of its predecessors, and even brings back a couple of characters from the original that are fun to say hello to again.  And even though there is an ominous undertone to this version (in the form of a threatening mobster, played by the always superb John Goodman), the Wolf Pack members demonstrate their ineptness over and over again, from getting trapped in the basement of a bad guy's mansion, to scooting down tied-together bedsheets from atop Caesar's Palace.  And is it ever fun to watch.Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, and Justin Bartha all return as Wolf Pack members Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug. . .and no HANGOVER version would be complete without the outrageous antics of Lesley Chow (Ken Jeong).  Look for brief appearances from the original by Heather Graham (the now-reformed Jade) and Mike Epps (""Black"" Doug); and Melissa McCarthy joins the cast as Cassie, a dysfunctional romantic interest for Alan.  THE HANGOVER PART III gleefully blazes its own plot trail, refusing to be a copycat of its two predecessors--although the closing credits bring a brief blackout scene that promises to be--in two respects--rather jarring.  And based on the demise of a giraffe, some fighting roosters, and a couple of guard dogs, this is not a movie that PETA is going to endorse.  If this is indeed the end of the HANGOVER franchise, THE HANGOVER PART III is a more than worthy finale.  Nice to see that Wolf Pack ride off into the sunset.--D.

But at the same time, the movie was very well written and extremely captivating.  Consider this movie an action or heist movie with funny parts (rather than a comedy with a heist in it) and suddenly the film becomes worth while.The characters seem very different than in the first two movies, to the point that it feels like the script was written by someone else.  Doug is taken hostage, so just like in the first two, we don't see much of him.  The character of Alan seems to have lost all of his humor and by the end of the movie, wants to change his ways.  While this provides a great end to the trilogy, it also seems very out of place.What works for this movie is the unfolding of this huge problem that the Wolfpack finds themselves in.  Several times throughout the story the three will find themselves in a bind, and you'll wonder how they will ever get out.

1560005,A26SV90ILK5BNO,B008JFUORW,Ethan,"[8, 12]","With the Hangover Part III, we are given the end of a trilogy that never needed to occur. The original film was a raunchy, off color story that left me laughing for the majority of its running time. This fresh comedy connected with audiences and became a breakout hit of 2009.Of course, when a movie is successful, it naturally warrants a sequel. With the Hangover Part II, the filmmakers stuck to the basic formula of the first film. While there were still plenty of laughs, it failed to live up to the high standards of the first one. Despite this, it made enough money to warrant yet another sequel.And so we arrive at the Hangover Part III. Although the original cast shows up to this movie, the story seems forced and the laughs are few and far in between. Most of the cast, and the filmmakers it seems, have phoned it in on this one. The movie becomes a kind of action thriller as the wolf pack sets out to find Chow.There are a few redeeming moments to this movie. Zach Galifianakis gives it his all and becomes the character that provides the most genuine laughs. His scene with Melissa McCarthy, in particular, is probably my favorite part of the movie. Additionally, John Goodman is always reliable for a few laughs, and his turn here, as a drug leader desperate to find Chow, is no exception.Overall, this film is more original than the formulaic Part II, but never finds the spark that ignited the original movie into a hit.",3,The End Of A Trilogy That Never Needed To Be,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,1436,"['Hangover', 'Part', 'III', 'are', 'given', 'end', 'trilogy', 'never', 'needed', 'occur', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'raunchy', 'off', 'color', 'story', 'left', 'laughing', 'majority', 'running', 'time', 'fresh', 'comedy', 'connected', 'audiences', 'became', 'breakout', 'hit', '2009.Of', 'course', 'when', 'movie', 'successful', 'naturally', 'warrants', 'sequel', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'II', 'filmmakers', 'stuck', 'basic', 'formula', 'first', 'film', 'were', 'still', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'failed', 'live', 'up', 'high', 'standards', 'first', 'one', 'made', 'enough', 'money', 'warrant', 'yet', 'sequel.And', 'arrive', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'III', 'original', 'cast', 'up', 'movie', 'story', 'forced', 'laughs', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'Most', 'cast', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'phoned', 'one', 'movie', 'kind', 'action', 'thriller', 'wolf', 'pack', 'out', 'find', 'Chow.There', 'are', 'few', 'redeeming', 'moments', 'movie', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'character', 'most', 'genuine', 'laughs', 'scene', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'particular', 'probably', 'favorite', 'part', 'movie', 'Additionally', 'John', 'Goodman', 'always', 'reliable', 'few', 'laughs', 'turn', 'here', 'drug', 'leader', 'desperate', 'find', 'Chow', 'exception.Overall', 'film', 'more', 'original', 'formulaic', 'Part', 'II', 'never', 'spark', 'ignited', 'original', 'movie', 'hit']",N/A

1560009,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008JFUORW,FNDNreview,"[7, 14]","Every summer, theaters are seemingly filled with sequels - desperately trying to recapture the magic of the original, not to mention break box office records.  However, it's quite unusual for a trilogy to be released over the span of four years, unless they were shot together.  In 2009, The Hangover was the breakout hit of the summer and currently sits atop the film charts as the highest grossing comedy of all-time, yet instead of focusing on the quality of the story, the studio opted to cash in on the popularity of the first film by quickly releasing a sequel in 2011, The Hangover II.  Met with negative reviews, The Hangover II was basically more of the same, so the news of a third film being green lit was a bit of a surprise.  In any event, here we are - in the summer of the 2013, and Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis have reunited for one last run as ""The Wolfpack"" in The Hangover III.Todd Phillips (The Hangover, The Hangover II) is back in the director's chair once again as The Wolfpack - Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) are on a mission to track down Chow (Ken Jeong), who recently escaped from prison.  When a drug kingpin, Marshall (John Goodman), is desperate to locate Chow and the gold he stole, Marshall kidnaps the Wolfpack and forces them to capture Chow and deliver him and the gold back to Marshall or their friend, Doug (Justin Bartha) - who is being held hostage, will be killed.  Heather Graham, Mike Epps, and Jeffrey Tambor also star in supporting roles.From the very beginning, writer/director Todd Philips said he was going to use a completely different template for The Hangover III - and sure enough, he did.  However, some characters are not meant to be tinkered with so dramatically, especially in the ""conclusion"" of the trilogy.  These characters, that many of us have come to know and love over the last few years, are hardly recognizable in this film - although quite of bit of time of this third film is spent showing flashbacks to the first two films, clearly trying too to tie these characters and their actions together in one big happy circle of continuity.  Sadly, Mr. Phillips has apparently lost his feel for these characters, making Alan and Chow more cartoonish and outlandishly stupid than usual, while making Stu and Phil borderline irrelevant.  It's pretty clear to say that the direction of the plot is easily visible, but it's just not supposed to be a Hangover film.The first two films in the series are based on the premise of The Wolfpack having to find someone that they lost - and to an extent, the third film is spent searching for an individual, also.  However, all of this usually takes place after a drug-laced night of partying, which includes a variety of amusing interactions - whether it is a tiger in the bathroom, a tattoo on someone's face, or a baby in the closet.  So, the main problem with The Hangover III is there's no hangover, and without that hangover, there's very little amusement.  This story jumps right in with Alan being the focal point, now off his medication and more deranged than ever - followed by a kidnapping by a drug boss that happened to be mentioned by name in the first film (which, of course, leads to the first of several flashbacks to the first two films).  Then, The Wolfpack are kidnapped, forced to have a bunch of uninteresting interactions with the not-so-funny Leslie Chow, followed by Alan's lightning fast love story.  In essence, The Hangover III is a poorly written script with bad dialogue and relatively zero memorable moments.  Honestly, it's shocking how poorly executed this film is, so much so that most viewers would be perfectly fine with a forth film just to set things right.The bad news about The Hangover III is that 98% of film is spent simply going through the motions and waiting for something to be funny.  However, the funny never comes - at least not until the final scene.  Like the previous films, The Hangover III also ends with a wedding, so without spoiling anything here, you'll just have to guess which one of the single cast members will be tying the knot.  Enter: Melissa McCarthy.  For those that don't know her yet, Melissa McCarthy really made a name for herself in the hysterical comedy, Bridesmaids, along with her CBS comedy, Mike & Molly.  Aside from the final scene of The Hangover III (which we will get to in a moment), Melissa McCarthy steals what brief scenes she does have.  In the event of a Hangover 4, and it's hard to imagine it not happening at some point, it would have the potential to be a complete laugh-fest if she were given a main role - since it's pretty clear after this film that Zach Galifianakis and Ken Jeong are less than amusing in their new leading roles.Even though The Hangover III is atrocious, the final scene of the film (which is about a quarter of the way into the credits) will make it all worthwhile.  This post wedding scene will have you borderline crying from laughing so hard as you walk out of the theater.  It really is quite astounding that one scene can make an hour and a half of poor dialogue and stupid jokes worth the price of admission - but sadly, that's the case here.  If the film could have led with this scene and gone on from there, it would have easily rivaled the original film.  But, some things just don't work out the way you want them to.  Just give it a few years, and The Hangover 4 will have a green light.Overall, if you've enjoyed the first two films and you're already emotionally invested in these characters, you'll want to see this film regardless of what anyone else tells you.  However, if you are the casual movie-goer that enjoyed the first film and simply tolerated the second - feel free to skip this one.  You won't be missing anything and there's certainly a plethora of better films to watch.FINAL GRADE - DFNDNreview.com",1,"'The Hangover' lacks laughs, direction",1369267200,"05 23,

1560046,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B008JFUORW,J. Richardson,"[4, 7]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Four years have passed since audiences everywhere received The Hangover. An over-the-top comedy that followed three men as they tried to figure out exactly what happened the night before. Two years later we were given the sequel. A movie so similar to the first that many people didn't really see the point of its existence. Well now we have the third, and final, installment in The Hangover trilogy. While the previous sequel suffered from being too similar, this big finale is so different in its delivery that it almost feels like a completely different film. From the beginning Todd Philips stated that the third movie would be different, but I don't think I ever would have expected this.Don't get me wrong, there's still a lot to love about The Hangover Part III. You still have Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis). Jade (Heather Graham) returns for a brief appearance, as does ""black"" Doug (Mike Epps), and we get to see an older Tyler aka ""Carlos"" (Grant Holmquist). The thing is, this third installment isn't inherently funny. There's the occasional funny moment scattered throughout the movie, but as a whole this finale aims to be more entertaining than it does to be funny. It took a much more serious approach and that's where it's going to lose a majority of its audience.The story takes place two years after the second film. After causing a huge wreck on the freeway, Alan's father (Jeffrey Tambor) is so furious with him that he has a heart attack and dies. Alan's mother -- along with the Wolfpack, his maid, and a young boy from across the street -- decides to hold an intervention to inform Alan that he should go rehab because he's been off his ADHD medication. On the way there they get pulled over by a man named Marshall (John Goodman) who takes Doug (again!) until they can get him the money that Chow (Ken Jeong) stole from him.There lies the biggest change to the original formula; there is no hangover. Now this wouldn't necessarily be a problem if the foundation for the series wasn't built on this pretty glaring omission. Instead of a movie built around yet another drug-induced hangover, we have one that's focused on Alan. The entire movie is more of a journey of him maturing in his own odd way. Between seeing ""his son"" Carlos and meeting Cassie (Melissa McCarthy), you see Alan realize that maybe his life isn't all that great and maybe he should start acting like an adult. In the end that's really what this movie's about and, now that I think about it, it seems fitting given the fact that Alan always seemed to be the one responsible for everything.If you've seen the previous installments then you can expect more of the same as far as acting goes. Bradley Cooper still plays his calm, cool, collective character; Stu is still the first to freak out; and Alan is still a man child for a majority of the film. Honestly, even though none of these performances were new, I still enjoyed it. What always attracted me to these films in the first place was the characters, not the story. The three leads have always had a weird dynamic that always felt right within the context of the story. With that said, this was probably my least favorite performance from Jeong in this series, but they made up for it by including Goodman. Because, let's be honest, you can never go wrong with Goodman. Melissa McCarthy was a nice touch as Cassie and the young Holmquist gave a nice little performance as Tyler.Overall Score: 7.25 - To be honest, I expected something more out of the big finale, but I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy myself.

Ever since then these movies have been pushed out as fast as possible producing 3 films in only 4 years. This is an unfortunate ingredient for failure. When a movie is not given a proper amount of time to be developed in the writing and plotting stage it can easily suffer from any number of things. First off the film is supposed to be a comedy and while the first brought the laughs by the barrel this one could hardly muster an occasional chuckle. Chow was an initial fan favorite but I feel at this point they've abused his power of being a good side character by bringing him too far into the spot light.

Fed up with his immaturity and drug abuse, his family decides that he needs to go to intervention.  Alan agrees, but only as long as Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha) take him to intervention in Phoenix, Arizona.  As the men are on their travels, they get sideswiped by Black Doug (Mike Epps) and crime boss Marshall (John Goodman).  Marshall abducts Doug for ransom in an effort to get back millions of dollars which were stolen from Marshall by Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong), who has broken out of Thai prison since the end of Hangover 2.  The men are tasked with finding Chow and getting the money back, which sends them on a wild goose chase that sees them chasing Chow across the American Southwest and Mexico.  As the men chase Chow and attempt to get the money, they reconnect with some of the people they met previously, such as Jade (Heather Graham) and her growing son (who was an infant in the first Hangover movie.)  Will the men find Chow?  If so, will they maintain an allegiance to Marshall or help Chow along the way?  Will Doug get killed before the ransom is delivered?  What crazy antics will Chow get them into this time?  And will Alan ever grow up?!This was the movie that Hangover 2 was meant to be:  A comedic action film that threw twists and turns along the way.  The reason that Hangover 2 was a flop was largely due to the fact that they tried to apply the action formula that was perfected in this movie to the exact same story (more or less) that was told during the first film.  Though the movie was critically panned, I laughed harder that this than I did Hangover 2 and found some moments to be as funny as the first.  Perhaps the reputation of the second movie made movie critics too cowardly to give this one better praises, but the reputation this one has is wholly unwarranted.  No it's not a classic, but it's certainly not a dud, either.  In the end, you have a very serviceable sequel that would be a slightly above-average film to watch even if you hadn't seen the other two.I recommend this for fans of the other Hangover films, action movies, and comedies.",3,The Movie Hangover 2 Was Meant To Be (3.5/5 Stars),1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,2279,"['Synopsis', 'Alan', 'Zach', 'Galifinakis', 'purchase', 'giraffe', 'recklessness', 'inadvertently', 'father', 'heart', 'attack', 'subsequent', 'death', 'Fed', 'up', 'immaturity', 'drug', 'abuse', 'family', 'go', 'intervention', 'Alan', 'only', 'as', 'long', 'Phil', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Stu', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'Doug', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'take', 'intervention', 'Phoenix', 'Arizona', 'men', 'are', 'travels', 'get', 'sideswiped', 'Black', 'Doug', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'crime', 'boss', 'Marshall', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Marshall', 'Doug', 'ransom', 'effort', 'get', 'back', 'millions', 'dollars', 'were', 'stolen', 'Marshall', 'Leslie', 'Chow', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'who', 'broken', 'Thai', 'prison', 'end', 'Hangover', '2', 'men', 'are', 'tasked', 'finding', 'Chow', 'getting', 'money', 'back', 'wild', 'goose', 'chase', 'chasing', 'Chow', 'American', 'Southwest', 'Mexico', 'men', 'chase', 'Chow', 'attempt', 'get', 'money', 'reconnect', 'people', 'met', 'previously', 'such', 'Jade', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'growing', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'infant', 'first', 'Hangover', 'movie', 'men', 'find', 'Chow', 'so', 'will', 'maintain', 'allegiance', 'Marshall', 'help', 'Chow', 'way', 'Will', 'Doug', 'get', 'killed', 'ransom', 'delivered', 'What', 'crazy', 'antics', 'will', 'Chow', 'get', 'time', 'will', 'Alan', 'ever', 'grow', 'up', 'was', 'movie', '2', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'comedic', 'action', 'film', 'threw', 'twists', 'along', 'way', 'reason', 'Hangover', '2', 'was', 'flop', 'was', 'largely', 'due', 'fact', 'tried', 'apply', 'action', 'formula', 'was', 'perfected', 'movie', 'exact', 'same', 'story', 'more', 'less', 'was', 'told', 'first', 'film', 'movie', 'was', 'critically', 'panned', 'laughed', 'harder', 'did', 'Hangover', '2', 'found', 'moments', 'be', 'as', 'funny', 'first', 'Perhaps', 'reputation', 'second', 'movie', 'made', 'movie', 'critics', 'too', 'cowardly', 'give', 'one', 'better', 'praises', 'reputation', 'one', 'wholly', 'unwarranted', 'not', 'classic', 'certainly', 'not', 'dud', 'end', 'have', 'very', 'serviceable', 'sequel', 'would', 'be', 'slightly', 'above-average', 'film', 'watch', 'even', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'two.I', 'recommend', 'fans', 'other', 'Hangover', 'films', 'action', 'movies', 'comedies']",N/A

It was very original and the best thing to come along in a long time.  There was no way any sequel was ever going to live up to the first movie, and that was made apparent when the best they could do for the second movie was to just copy the first one, just swapping out some of the jokes.This, honestly would have been a far better follow up to the first movie.  It expands on what happened in the first movie, even bringing back some of the same characters (even the baby as a 4yr old kid).  The best thing about it, is that while it does refer back to the other movies, it was not a carbon copy of them.  There is still a lot of crude humor and over the top situations in this one, so if you do not like that kind of stuff in a movie, or did not like the others then you will not like this.  I think if you really liked the first movie, you can enjoy this one (even if you did not like the second one) if you are willing to accept the fact that it is not as good as the original.As for extras, there are a handful of relatively short behind the scenes features, a gag reel, and some deleted scenes.

But director Todd Phillips has made the mistake of thinking that we enjoy the Hangover films because we want to see our three stars behave like some kind of modern-day, R-rated Three Stooges.  Taking painful blows.  Insulting each other.  Being generally misanthropic and unlikeable.  In fact, what we loved about the first film had just as much to do with the camaraderie between the 3 main characters, as well as a healthy dose of the element of surprise.  It was a comedy with a mystery (what DID happen that night, and where the heck is Doug?).  The comedy came first; the mystery was the vehicle through which surprising things could happen.  (Best of all...Mr. Chow jumping nude from the trunk!).  But we laughed and we enjoyed our time with these hapless and unusual characters.  HANGOVER PART II rehashed the plot, but raised the stakes and raised the violence level.  It now was meant to be amusing when a character is raped or another is mutilated and his surgical career ruined.III is a full-fledged action flick, with bits of comedy thrown in.  Animals and people die...violently.  Frequently.  The tone is thus very aggressive.  And it's mean-spirited because the characters really spend much of the film hating each other.  They seem to bristle being in the same scenes together...and I don't just mean the characters.  Bradley Cooper is dialing it in, and seems to be hoping he'll slip under the radar.  Ed Helms mostly yells about how fed up he is with everything, and the actor seems to mean it as much as his character.  Zach Galifianakis fares best, but he's also just relying on being as weird and inappropriate as possible, rather than being a real person.  That being said, almost every funny line in the movie is his.  I suspect I could count on my ten fingers the number of genuine laughs in the film.And HANGOVER III makes the mistake of essentially making Mr. Chow the 4th star.  He's in the film almost as much as the other guys and he officially wears out his welcome within 10 minutes.  His character should only be doled out in small doses, and while he was quite funny in #1 and annoying in #2, he is flat out UNWELCOME in #3.  I think Ken Jeong can be a very funny performer, and he's capable of some real acting...but by the end of this film, I truly hoped he might be killed off.John Goodman is on hand in the role of a bad guy, and he's given nothing funny or remarkable to do.  How do you as a screenwriter or director waste John Goodman, one of the most naturally affable and engaging actors in film?  Melissa McCarthy makes what is initially a welcome appearance as a pawn shop owner who takes a liking to Galifianakis' Alan.  But her character grows tiresome.  Another victim of director Phillips' inclination to leave the camera on just a couple of beats too long.  Sometimes uncomfortable silences are funny; sometimes they are just uncomfortable.  Guess which way HANGOVER PART III leans?  Heather Graham makes a return appearance and even Jeffrey Tambor is briefly on hand.  Pretty much everyone looks vaguely unhappy to be in this film.  The whole enterprise reeks of ""Contractual Obligation.""  I wish they'd felt obligated to provide more laughs.It's sad to see the series end this way, with ever diminishing returns.  If you're a big fan of the first two, I'd say you should go ahead and drag yourself to this.  Maybe.

I, on the other hand, must profoundly disagree with this vastly baffling majority. The Hangover Part III is a fitting final chapter that is far from `tasteless,' and in fact even expresses some rather poignant truths about friendship.The Hangover Part III wisely turns its back on the ""what happened last night?"" premise, and freshens things up with a new conflict, although it still involves looking for Doug. This time the Wolfpack assembles for an intervention for Allen (Zack Galifianakis) following the sudden death of his father (Jeffery Tambor) and a terribly public mishap with a giraffe. While enroute to a mental rehabilitation facility, Allen, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Doug (Justin Bartha) are abducted by mobster, Marshall (John Goodman). Marshall orders Phil, Stu, and Allen to track down Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) who stole $21 million in gold from him or he'll kill Doug. It seems oddly hypocritical that series like the Harry Potter films are allowed to break with formula and get significantly darker over time, yet when a film like The Hangover Part III does the same, there is an uproar. Nonetheless, this new direction allows the characters more room to breathe as they commence an enjoyable manhunt that takes them to California, to Tiajuana, and of course, to Vegas!Various nods to the previous two films are sprinkled throughout in enjoyable ways and even the Marshall character is fittingly introduced. Jeong's role is substantially larger in this installment, and while his presence felt far too forced and substantial in the second film, he shines in Part III. It is true that there are not as many laughs in The Hangover Part III as there were in the original, but it also has a different tone where laughs are sacrificed for occasional moments of intensity. Nonetheless, the film is still a comedy, and the laughs that happen are strong and surpass the lazy unoriginal ones from Part II. In fact, this film minimizes its references to Part II to such a degree that this film could be considered Part II, and Part II could be a sort of appendix or something.The argument for whether Part III (or Part II) was necessary is a larger issue that does not only apply to this set of films but to all part II's and part III's. Thus, on the merits of what is presented, The Hangover Part III is a successful and entertaining film. It devises a reasonable premise, offers a clever plot-twist or two, and even provides some insight on friendship. The latter part is perhaps the film's least successful endeavor, as it pounds the audience over the head with various versions of Trent Reznor's song ""Hurt;"" however, a scene towards the end utilizing that song does have a ring of truth to it.Director Todd Phillips listened to his critics and detractors after Part II and gave them exactly what they wanted in Part III, yet his new vision is not being embraced. While the franchise has seemingly run out of steam, and a Hangover Part IV is incredibly unlikely and ill-advised, Part III is a perfectly good send off to these characters that deserves to be seen even if the ""hang"" is ""over."" BThe Hangover Part III is rated R and has a running time of 1 hour and 40 minutes. While there is no stinger after the credits, definitely make sure you stick around for about a minute after the credits begin rolling.",3,"The Hang is Over, but III is Better than II",1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,3674,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'critics', 'were', 'expecting', 'see', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'III', 'clearly', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Words', 'deplorable', 'tasteless', 'unfunny', 'indecent', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'describe', 'film', 'not', 'mention', 'too', 'repeated', 'yet', 'inevitable', 'phrase', 'what', 'happened', 'Vegas', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'Vegas', 'other', 'hand', 'must', 'profoundly', 'disagree', 'vastly', 'baffling', 'majority', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'III', 'fitting', 'final', 'chapter', 'far', 'tasteless', 'fact', 'even', 'rather', 'poignant', 'truths', 'friendship.The', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'III', 'wisely', 'back', 'what', 'happened', 'last', 'night', 'premise', 'freshens', 'things', 'up', 'new', 'conflict', 'still', 'looking', 'Doug', 'time', 'Wolfpack', 'assembles', 'intervention', 'Allen', 'Zack', 'Galifianakis', 'following', 'sudden', 'death', 'father', 'Jeffery', 'Tambor', 'terribly', 'public', 'mishap', 'giraffe', 'enroute', 'mental', 'rehabilitation', 'facility', 'Allen', 'Phil', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Stu', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'Doug', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'are', 'abducted', 'mobster', 'Marshall', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Marshall', 'orders', 'Phil', 'Stu', 'Allen', 'track', 'down', 'Mr.', 'Chow', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'who', 'stole', '21', 'million', 'gold', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'Doug', 'oddly', 'hypocritical', 'series', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'are', 'allowed', 'break', 'formula', 'get', 'significantly', 'darker', 'time', 'yet', 'when', 'film', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'III', 'same', 'uproar', 'Nonetheless', 'new', 'direction', 'characters', 'more', 'room', 'breathe', 'commence', 'enjoyable', 'manhunt', 'California', 'Tiajuana', 'course', 'Vegas', 'Various', 'nods', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'sprinkled', 'enjoyable', 'ways', 'even', 'Marshall', 'character', 'fittingly', 'introduced', 'Jeong', 'role', 'substantially', 'larger', 'installment', 'presence', 'felt', 'far', 'too', 'forced', 'substantial', 'second', 'film', 'Part', 'III', 'true', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'laughs', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'III', 'were', 'original', 'also', 'different', 'tone', 'where', 'laughs', 'are', 'sacrificed', 'occasional', 'moments', 'intensity', 'Nonetheless', 'film', 'still', 'comedy', 'laughs', 'happen', 'are', 'strong', 'surpass', 'lazy', 'unoriginal', 'ones', 'Part', 'II', 'fact', 'film', 'references', 'Part', 'II', 'such', 'degree', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'Part', 'II', 'Part', 'II', 'could', 'be', 'sort', 'appendix', 'something.The', 'argument', 'Part', 'III', 'Part', 'II', 'was', 'necessary', 'larger', 'issue', 'not', 'only', 'apply', 'set', 'films', 'part', 'II', 'part', 'III', 'Thus', 'merits', 'what', 'presented', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'III', 'successful', 'entertaining', 'film', 'reasonable', 'premise', 'clever', 'plot-twist', 'two', 'even', 'insight', 'friendship', 'latter', 'part', 'perhaps', 'film', 'least', 'successful', 'endeavor', 'audience', 'head', 'various', 'versions', 'Trent', 'Reznor', 'song', 'Hurt', 'however', 'scene', 'end', 'utilizing', 'song', 'have', 'ring', 'truth', 'it.Director', 'Todd', 'Phillips', 'listened', 'critics', 'detractors', 'Part', 'II', 'gave', 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'Part', 'III', 'yet', 'new', 'vision', 'not', 'being', 'embraced', 'franchise', 'seemingly', 'run', 'steam', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'IV', 'incredibly', 'unlikely', 'ill-advised', 'Part', 'III', 'perfectly', 'good', 'send', 'off', 'characters', 'be', 'seen', 'even', 'hang', 'BThe', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'III', 'rated', 'R', 'running', 'time', '1', 'hour', '40', 'minutes', 'stinger', 'credits', 'definitely', 'make', 'sure', 'stick', 'minute', 'credits', 'begin', 'rolling']",N/A

Almost.The key difference between ""III"" and the first two installments is that there is never a single moment in the film when the three characters played by Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis seem happy to be together. In the first two films, there was at least the possibility of a good time at the bachelor party each film begins with. This moment helps illustrate their friendship and gives us a reason to go on these harrowing journeys with them. Yes, things go horribly wrong, but in the beginning, they are happy and excited. In ""III"", the reason for their trip is very different and they all seem to dread the very idea of the journey which doesn't help the film get off to a good start.In ""III"", Alan (Galifianakis) has not been taking his meds leading to even more erratic behavior than in the previous films. When his actions lead to a pretty irresponsible, unsettling event, his family decides to have an intervention and Phil (Cooper), Stu (Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha) agree to drive Alan to a rehab facility in Arizona. On the way, Marshall (John Goodman), a gangster, has his men run the friends off the road. He takes Doug as a hostage and will return him if the other three find Chow (Ken Jeung), who has just escaped from a Thai prison. Chow stole $20 million in gold bars from the gangster and he wants it back. They hit the road and travel from Arizona to Tijuana before finally ending up back in Vegas. Along the way, they get into dangerous situations, people get hurt and killed, animals die, all in the pursuit of finding the gold and returning it. These situations aren't inherently funny and even the cast and crew seem to realize this because everything is played straight, leading to a bad impression of an action film.Seriously, the only person who even seems to be attempting something funny is Galifianakis. He takes the man-child character he always plays to familiar places, places already explored with much more energy and vitality by John Candy, Jim Belushi, Chris Farley and others. This type of humor is, for me, best served in small doses. When the character and behavior are prevalent throughout the entire film, everything in the narrative seems dumb, just dumb, not smart-funny dumb. It is much harder to do smart-funny dumb, which is why we so seldom see it, and why so many comedies are completely forgettable.Cooper and Helms grimace and frown their way through the entire film. And they have a right to, because they are in one dangerous situation after another. Hopefully, the large sequel-sized paycheck each received made up for this unpleasant experience. But what about our unpleasant experience? Who will pay us? We have to pay to sit and watch this dreck. That seems backward somehow.I find it hard to believe that director Todd Phillips envisioned these films as a trilogy; when the first one made so much money, the plans for II and III were born. The phenomenal success of the first led to a virtual copycat set in a different country. Now, with the ""Epic Conclusion"", he changes the format of the film. Initially, this is a welcome idea - ""II"" was a hollow retread of the first film - but why make this film at all if you can't figure out a way to incorporate, in some way, the original idea? Basically, the only connection between the three films is the characters. Everything in this film happens moving forward, so the initial shock of seeing an outrageous moment and then learning about the circumstances leading up to it is gone. I suppose Alan killing a giraffe and the aftermath of this situation is meant to stand in for the bachelor party scene, but it is simply shocking and grimace-inducing. It just isn't funny.Phillips is a mixed bag as a director. He's done some good films (""Old School"", ""The Hangover"") but most of his films are jaw-droppingly bad.The road trip element of the story allows the narrative to return to Vegas and bring back some of the memorable characters from the first film; the boys visit Heather Graham's character at her new home. Her former hooker is now leading a respectable life with a new husband. The inclusion of this scene is just bizarre. It really isn't needed which leads to the question ""why is it included?"" To give all of Heather Graham's fans another look? Does she even have fans anymore? So the scene is not only unnecessary but boring.How bad does a movie have to be when even Melissa McCarthy isn't funny? McCarthy pops up in a cameo. This is the first time I have not laughed at one of her cameos or performances. Her character is simply mean which is supposed to be a mirror image of Alan's treatment of others, but that doesn't work either. A mirror image of something that doesn't work is also something that doesn't work.There are a number of incidents involving animals. In each, the animal is drugged, harmed or killed. Is this supposed to be funny? I think it is sort of sad. Everytime an animal pops up, something happens to them. In the other two films, animals make appearances and the level of harm played out on these creatures throughout the series seems gratuitous and out of proportion. Were the animals actually harmed during the filmmaking? No. But depicting these moments as `comedy' just seems wrong. Very wrong.When the story finally gets to Vegas, the three men regard the opportunity to revisit the iconic city with palpable dread. They eventually learn that Chow is holed up in a penthouse at Caesar's Palace. Alan refers to the resort as a `hell-hole'. When they finally make it to the hotel, there is an extended sequence featuring acrobatics from the penthouse. My question is: Did Las Vegas and Caesar's Palace partner with the producers to make this film? Neither is painted in a very positive light. If you had your product featured in a film and someone referred to it as a `hell-hole' would you be happy? It might very well seem like an awful place to the characters, but none of this is remotely funny and seems like a stupid waste of time.And on that note, I don't want to waste any more of our time on a movie that is essentially a complete waste of time.",1,Suffers From Sequel-Itis Hangover,1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,6218,"['Hangover', 'Part', 'III', 'joyless', 'unhappy', 'excuse', 'film',

As fans, we want to see more and learn more about the characters we know and love, but no matter how good that sequel is, not all of the fans are going to like it. If the movie is too much like the first one, the fans say it's the same movie, but if it's too different, they say it doesn't fit the story. The only place the writers/producers are going to win is at the box office, because no matter the reviews, they know people are going to come and see it. The Hangover Part III is getting terrible reviews from fans, because it's not what they expected. It's not as funny as the first one or even the second one, in fact, this film is much more dramatic than the rest of the films in the series, but it not necessarily a bad thing. Alan may not have had a ton of funny lines and Stu's girlish screaming may have run it's course, but this was still a really good story. Using flashbacks from the original, Todd Phillips introduces us to a part of the story that we didn't even know existed until now. This time, they skip the hangover and the wolf pack needs to go on an adventure to capture Mr. Chow. Four years ago, Chow ripped off another gangster and that gangster kidnaps Doug and threatens to kill him unless the wolf pack can bring him Chow. The story was solid and included some of the comedy we love along with dramatic elements and even a couple of really exciting chase scenes. No, this film was not the hangover we've come to love and expect. The clever one-liners aren't there, there's no wedding to prepare for, and the stakes are much higher this time, but all in all the story was very solid and the performances were fantastic. This film was a great way to end the story of the wolf pack, yet many fans and critic alike insist on comparing it to the first one. This film is much different than the original, too different in the opinions of many. If you want to compare Part III to the original Hangover, than no it's nowhere near as good, but if you look at it based on it's own merits, it's a pretty solid film, albeit much different from what was expected.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]  - @tss5078,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,2129,"['Moviegoers', 'want', 'sequels', 'why', 'are', 'made', 'fans', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'learn', 'more', 'characters', 'know', 'love', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'sequel', 'not', 'fans', 'are', 'going', 'like', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'first', 'one', 'fans', 'say', 'same', 'movie', 'too', 'different', 'say', ""n't"", 'fit', 'story', 'only', 'place', 'writers/producers', 'are', 'going', 'win', 'box', 'office', 'matter', 'reviews', 'know', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'come', 'see', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'III', 'getting', 'terrible', 'reviews', 'fans', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'first', 'one', 'even', 'second', 'one', 'fact', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'dramatic', 'rest', 'films', 'series', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'Alan', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'ton', 'funny', 'lines', 'Stu', 'girlish', 'screaming', 'may', 'have', 'run', 'course', 'was', 'still', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'Using', 'flashbacks', 'original', 'Todd', 'Phillips', 'part', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'existed', 'now', 'time', 'skip', 'hangover', 'wolf', 'pack', 'go', 'adventure', 'capture', 'Mr.', 'Chow', 'Four', 'years', 'ago', 'Chow', 'ripped', 'off', 'gangster', 'gangster', 'kidnaps', 'Doug', 'kill', 'wolf', 'pack', 'can', 'bring', 'Chow', 'story', 'was', 'solid', 'included', 'comedy', 'love', 'along', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'even', 'couple', 'really', 'exciting', 'chase', 'scenes', 'No', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'hangover', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'expect', 'clever', 'one-liners', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'wedding', 'prepare', 'stakes', 'are', 'much', 'higher', 'time', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'solid', 'performances', 'were', 'fantastic', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'end', 'story', 'wolf', 'pack', 'yet', 'many', 'fans', 'critic', 'alike', 'insist', 'comparing', 'first', 'one', 'film', 'much', 'different', 'original', 'too', 'different', 'opinions', 'many', 'want', 'compare', 'Part', 'III', 'original', 'Hangover', 'nowhere', 'near', 'good', 'look', 'based', 'own', 'merits', 'pretty', 'solid', 'film', 'albeit', 'much', 'different', 'what', 'was', 'expected']",N/A

The second one I didn't like mainly because it was just a remake and rehash of the same jokes. I was a little leery going in to this one because of that. This one actually has a different plot and that fact alone made it better then the second one. Rather then piecing together the events of the previous night this one is about the events the group gets into trying to catch Chow (who in my opinion is the best part of the series). This isn't really a review that will convince you to watch or not watch since it is the third in the series, but I will say that I really liked this one more then I expected. Overall, if you liked the first two you will love this. If you didn't like the second one you will like this. I give it a B+.",3,Unlike the 2nd one this is funny and different. A good conclusion to the trilogy. Even if you didn't like #2 watch this.I say B+,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,1259,"['Feels', 'good', 'be', 'out', 'Tell', 'one', ""'ll"", 'be', 'touch', 'Chow', 'Two', 'years', 'events', 'Bangkok', 'wolf', 'pack', 'settling', 'back', 'normality', 'Normal', 'Alan', 'Galifianakis', 'not', 'taking', 'meds', 'buying', 'giraffes', 'death', 'father', 'group', 'together', 'take', 'rehab', 'way', 'get', 'stopped', 'are', 'given', 'ultimatum', 'must', 'find', 'Chow', 'who', 'stolen', 'money', 'man', 'friend', 'Doug', 'will', 'die', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'Hangover', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'crazy', 'everyone', 'else', 'second', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'mainly', 'was', 'just', 'remake', 'rehash', 'same', 'jokes', 'was', 'little', 'leery', 'going', 'one', 'because', 'one', 'actually', 'different', 'plot', 'fact', 'alone', 'made', 'better', 'then', 'second', 'one', 'then', 'piecing', 'together', 'events', 'previous', 'night', 'one', 'events', 'group', 'trying', 'catch', 'Chow', 'who', 'opinion', 'best', 'part', 'series', ""n't"", 'really', 'review', 'will', 'convince', 'watch', 'not', 'watch', 'third', 'series', 'will', 'say', 'really', 'liked', 'one', 'more', 'then', 'expected', 'Overall', 'liked', 'first', 'two', 'will', 'love', 'did', ""n't"", 'second', 'one', 'will', 'like', 'give', 'B+']",N/A

1560151,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B008JFUORW,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","If you thought the first sequel was darker than the original, the second sequel ""The Hangover Part III"" gets much darker, with several deaths including that of one poor animal. I'm not particularly against the idea of deaths in as long as they are funny. Unfortunately, that is not the case with the third ""Hangover.""Actually, we meet the ""wolf pack"" again, but this time the story has nothing to do with ""hangover."" Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug (Justin Bartha) are threatened by an angry mobster named Marshall (John Goodman), whose $ 42 million-worth gold is stolen by Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong). With Doug taken hostage, Phil, Stu and Alan have to retrieve the gold, no matter what it takes.The script for the third installment is written by Todd Phillips, who also directs, and Craig Mazin, one of the co-writers for ""The Hangover Part II,"" but it looks as if someone has borrowed a storyline from some other action thriller. Some jokes are funny, and Melissa McCarthy steals the show in a cameo role, but the creative energy of the original is sadly gone.So, what you get here instead is the wolf pack members, now bland almost invisible with an exception of Alan. And lots of Mr. Chow. Both characters have become not only more eccentric, but darker and even meaner.

The film is notable to a certain degree for its divergence from the overtly comic formula to something more thriller-oriented and darkly humourous in content.Much of the film focuses on Alan's problems building up when a giraffe's head gets decapitated, his father who passed away, and Mr. Chow, who returns again, to con the Wolf Pack and steal their money and goods. The film stands out slightly with its action-thriller type of plotline and its insistence on being moreover something that is bizarre and hilarious yet tense at the same time. John Goodman makes a surprise appearance here as a frustrated gangster and his presence here shines with irony and seriousness. The film's budget has been amped a bit to give a more cinematic edge to it with the action set pieces and locale.Even with its pluses, nothing is really spectacular about this film other than Alan falling off a rope made of bed sheets and stuck between E and S of Caesar's Palace, Mr. Chow running away from a Thai prison, Melissa McCarthy appearing as a cameo and hinting something suggestively with a salivated lollipop, and Mr. Chow sniffing a spiked cocktail. The film, surprisingly, is more brutal and violent than its sex-heavy predecessors and especially for people not used to dark comedy or comic animal cruelty, Part III will especially be troubling.Aside from that, if you are already caught up by now, Part III would probably be a better choice because of the differences that exist even if you have or have not seen Part II. In the end, the finale was worthy and was not too bad. It made me laugh and made me believe its zaniness toward the end but nothing more though.""",3,A different league of its own.
