1013141,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B000HDR8A0,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[23, 24]","First off I have to say that I was a fan of the show when it was airing in Los Angeles, back in the late 70s/early 80s(?). And I was happy when I found this set was available. I missed the first set, so I didn't know that this was part 2. I guess the ""Set 2"" on the cover should have been a clue, but since I bought this at a store, which didn't have set 1, I went ahead a got it. The box doesn't include episode info just topic headings for each of the three dvds (THE BEGINNING, THE GREAT ESCAPES, A NOT SO QUIET RIOT), which could mean anything.Well, after doing some research, I found out that PRISONER CELL BLOCK H had over 650 episodes and was aired on Australian tv for over seven years, long after it was canceled here in the US. So I had no idea that when the box said, ""...12 complete , drama-filled episodes spanning from start to finish..."" would mean episodes and characters I've never seen.Because of this, the dvd set is sort of piecemeal with episodes jumping from #20 to #165 and then #471. Not good for a serial (soap-opera) with story lines that continue from episode to episode. I understand that the producers of this dvd set were trying to put the best episodes in the appropriate topic (i.e. ""Not So Quiet Riot""), but it doesn't work. And it really doesn't work for an American audience since we never saw the later seasons and have no idea who the characters are.When the episodes jump on the second dvd from #165 to #471, the entire cast changes except for the actress who played prison guard Meg Jackson. And episode #165 ended with a cliff hanger where inmates Bea Smith, Lizzie (?) and Doreen Anderson, along with newer inmates, get stuck in a tunnel, while trying to escape form Wentworth. The tunnel starts to cave in on them and the episode ends. Did they die? Did they make it? Did Lizzie and Bea make it back to the prison un-noticed? We'll never know... at least not from this dvd set.Another thing that happens starting with episode #471, aside from a different cast, the show almost becomes a parody of itself. Kind of like watching a spoof on PRISONER rather than the actual show, and the actresses don't look very menacing or even harden criminals like the original cast. They just look like women with crew cuts trying to act like tomboys, but not very convincing. The show almost seems as though its realized what it is and the magic disappeared. I couldn't watch the rest of it including the end of episode #598 on dvd 2 and none of dvd 3. Maybe one of these days I will watch the remaining episodes, but at that point, I didn't care about the show or the characters anymore, probably because I didn't know what was going on. That's the problem with putting out a greatest hits compilation of shows especially when that show is a serial.The good part of the set is dvd 1(THE BEGINNING) and the first two episodes of dvd 2:DVD ONE: EPISODES 1-4These episodes introduce life at Wentworth prison through two new inmates, Karen Travers and Lynn Warner. Each found guilty of different crimes, Travers for killing her husband and Warner for attempting to kill a small boy she was caring for, and the audience is introduced to life inside the all women prison, including getting to know each of the main characters. Great start and includes the scene when Bea burns Warner's hand, for those of you who remember. Viewer's also get reacquainted with characters they might have forgot like inmates Frankie Doyle and Doreen Anderson, and prison guards Vera Bennett and Meg Jackson.DVD TWO: EPISODES 20, 165, 471, 598The stand outs are #20 and #165. Even though the second dvd jumps to episode 20 and then to episode 165, leaving many questions unanswered and can be confusing for new viewers, it's not so jarring that you can't get into the story. #20 shows Frankie and Doreen have escaped from Wentworth (how? I don't remember and you won't find out on this set) and ends with a shootout. #165 ends with a cliff hanger, see above, and gone are the two inmates who brought us into the prison in episode 1, Travers and Warner. Were they acquitted? Escaped? Died? Paroled? You won't find that out here!#471 and 598, this is where the set went down hill for me. Gone are all the original characters, including the Governor of Wentworth, and you have no idea what happened. At this point it seemed pointless and boring and only fans who watched the series from beginning to end will understand what's going on!There are no extra stuff on this set, unlike set one, and unless you're a die hard fan, wait until they release a complete set of each season, which they probably won't do. Even if you are a fan, if you lived in the US and watched the shows when they originally aired, like me, you still won't be able to understand what's going on after episode #165.If I had known this, I would've waited. I read the reviews on PRISONER CELL BLOCK H: SET ONE, and that sounds like the episodes are disjointed as well. But, it has some extra's like the interview with the actress who played inmate Bea Smith, so I might purchase that.",3,Not complete!!!,1168992000,"01 17, 2007",2007,5054,"['First', 'off', 'have',

1013145,A1VWK6ZDVE8VII,B000HDR8A0,"F. R. Lewis ""DP Fred""","[0, 0]","Jim Unger, the cartoonist who drew &#34;Herman,&#34; once remarked that &#34;Herman&#34; was not one particular character (although he was often a disheveled middle-aged man with glasses), but a state of mind.In like manner, this anthology of &#34;Prisoner Cell  Block H&#34; (PCBH) is best approached as a state of mind, a particular perspective, a point of view.  The excepts here culled from 8 years and 692 episodes have different characters (Vera Bennett, Bea Smith....Joan Ferguson, Lou Kelly, Rita Conners) but the same issues and allegories:  resistance to unaccountable authorities, oppression of women whose attempts to assert themselves or survive makes them outlaws in a patriarchal society.  Whereas the entire series of &#34;Prisoner&#34; was a perfect match of form and content - the long drawn-out story arcs of soap opera precisely resemble the endless waiting and tedium of prison life - this anthology by necessity eschews the tedium in favor of moments of excitement - as Jack Lemmon put it in a different context in &#34;the China Syndrome,&#34; &#34;Twenty years of boredom and twenty minutes of terror.&#34;The first disc contains the first four episodes, introducing the viewer to the claustrophobic anxiety, pervasive tension, and dehumanization of prison life, as well as the allegory of class boundaries between the prisoners (proles), guards (middle class), and governor (upper class).  Resistance to authority is undermined by factional disputes (such as Franky's struggle against  Bea to become inmate leader or &#34;top dog&#34;) as well as personal limitatons owing to prior inadequate life experience (Franky has a serous anger management problem)..  Yet resistance, though necessary and laudable, is apt to lead to intended, serious consequences - such as grief for Sr. Officer Meg Morris, whom the prisoners regard as a basically decent person even though one of the &#34;other side.&#34;The second disc contains episodes from different parts of the series focusing on escapes: the desperate desire to taste freedom if only for a short time, the indomitability of the human spirit, the resourcefulness of human reason, the panache of romantic daring.  Hard case Marie Winter's escape, in particular, brings to mind Browning's line: &#34;A man's reach should exceed his grasp/ or what is heaven for?&#34;The third disc explores the sociology of the riot, in terms of four separate riots: although the riots themselves are presented as underway, rather than evolving through long-term pressures: the moment when, in Rene Thom's catastrophe theory, there is a decisive break, a quantum leap from one state (frustration) to another (acting up, acting out).  The viewer gets a keen sense of the adrenalin-pumping riot experience from experienced rioters.  The gender axis of the race-class-gender nexus is in full view in these episodes, as the various female officials familiar with the women (the governor, deputy governor, senior officers) try to calm the situation down through negotiation, while it is male officials who demand rapid action such as storming the building with (male) riot police, mainly because they are concerned about adverse publicity and their personal reputation.  State of Victoria prisons boss Ted Douglas's humiliation of Erica Davis is an mpressive example.  Only the other Prisoner (the famous Patrick McGoohan series) has ever been as allegorical on television as this: it is the men (Douglas, Jim Fletcher, Bob Moran, Ernest Craven) who ultimately beat the inmates down, who force the women back into cages again.",4,A state of mind,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,3576,"['Jim', 'Unger', 'cartoonist', 'who', 'drew', '34', 'Herman', '34', 'once', 'remarked', '34', 'Herman', '34', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'particular', 'character', 'was', 'often', 'disheveled', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'glasses', 'state', 'mind.In', 'manner', 'anthology', '34', 'Prisoner', 'Cell', 'Block', 'H', '34', 'PCBH', 'best', 'approached', 'state', 'mind', 'particular', 'perspective', 'point', 'view', 'excepts', 'here', 'culled', '8', 'years', '692', 'episodes', 'have', 'different', 'characters', 'Vera', 'Bennett', 'Bea', 'Smith', '.Joan', 'Ferguson', 'Lou', 'Kelly', 'Rita', 'Conners', 'same', 'issues', 'allegories', 'resistance', 'unaccountable', 'authorities', 'oppression', 'women', 'attempts', 'assert', 'survive', 'outlaws', 'patriarchal', 'society', 'entire', 'series', '34', 'Prisoner', '34', 'was', 'perfect', 'match', 'form', 'content', 'long', 'drawn-out', 'story', 'arcs', 'soap', 'opera', 'precisely', 'resemble', 'endless', 'waiting', 'tedium', 'prison', 'life', 'anthology', 'necessity', 'tedium', 'favor', 'moments', 'excitement', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'put', 'different', 'context', '34', 'China', 'Syndrome', '34', '34', 'Twenty', 'years', 'boredom', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'terror.', '34', 'first', 'disc', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'introducing', 'viewer', 'claustrophobic', 'anxiety', 'pervasive', 'tension', 'dehumanization', 'prison', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'allegory', 'class', 'boundaries', 'prisoners', 'proles', 'guards', 'middle', 'class', 'governor', 'upper', 'class', 'Resistance', 'authority', 'undermined', 'factional', 'disputes', 'such', 'Franky', 'struggle', 'Bea', 'become', 'inmate', 'leader', '34', 'top', 'dog', '34', 'as', 'well', 'personal', 'limitatons', 'owing', 'prior', 'inadequate', 'life', 'experience', 'Franky', 'serous', 'anger', 'management', 'problem', '..', 'resistance', 'necessary', 'laudable', 'apt', 'lead', 'intended', 'serious', 'consequences', 'such', 'grief', 'Sr', 'Officer', 'Meg', 'Morris', 'whom', 'prisoners', 'regard', 'basically', 'decent', 'person', 'even', 'one', '34', 'other', 'side.', '34', 'second', 'disc', 'contains', 'episodes', 'different', 'parts', 'series', 'focusing', 'escapes', 'desperate', 'desire', 'taste', 'freedom', 'only', 'short', 'time', 'indomitability', 'human', 'spirit', 'resourcefulness', 'human', 'reason', 'panache', 'romantic', 'daring', 'Hard', 'case', 'Marie', 'Winter', 'escape', 'particular', 'mind', 'Browning', 'line', '34', 'man', 'reach', 'should', 'exceed', 'grasp/', 'what', 'heaven', '34', 'third', 'disc', 'sociology', 'riot', 'terms', 'four', 'separate', 'riots', 'riots', 'are', 'presented', 'underway', 'rather', 'evolving', 'long-term', 'pressures', 'moment', 'when', 'Rene', 'Thom', 'catastrophe', 'theory', 'decisive', 'break', 'quantum', 'leap', 'one', 'state', 'frustration', 'acting', 'up', 'acting', 'out', 'viewer', 'keen', 'sense', 'adrenalin-pumping', 'riot', 'experience', 'experienced', 'rioters', 'gender', 'axis', 'race-class-gender', 'nexus', 'full', 'view', 'episodes', 'various', 'female', 'officials', 'familiar', 'women', 'governor', 'deputy', 'governor', 'senior', 'officers', 'try', 'calm', 'situation', 'down', 'negotiation', 'male', 'officials', 'who', 'demand', 'rapid', 'action', 'such', 'storming', 'building', 'male', 'riot', 'police', 'mainly', 'are', 'concerned', 'adverse', 'publicity', 'personal', 'reputation', 'State', 'Victoria', 'prisons', 'Ted', 'Douglas', 'humiliation', 'Erica', 'Davis', 'mpressive', 'example', 'Only', 'other', 'Prisoner', 'famous', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'series', 'ever', 'been', 'as', 'allegorical', 'television', 'men', 'Douglas', 'Jim', 'Fletcher', 'Bob', 'Moran', 'Ernest', 'Craven', 'who', 'ultimately', 'beat', 'inmates', 'down', 'who', 'force', 'women', 'back', 'cages', 'again']","Prisoner Cell Block H, Set 2"

At least this set contains really early episodes whereas the first set was pretty pathetic and included episodes from 300 onwards (despite being labelled ""the early years""). At least with Set 2 you get to see where it all started with the inclusion of episodes 1-4.I always preferred the earlier years as, in my opinion, the first mean Prison Warden, Vera Bennett (played by Fiona Spence), was much better. It was odd how the first set only included one episode showing her.While Set 2 is definitely an improvement on Set 1, it has to be said that these episodes were picked by the DVD distributor and are not fan favourites like they claim. Who really determines what are the best out of 692 episodes? That's why about a year ago, a DVD company in Australia started releasing every single episode with about 25 episodes per volume.  That's a pretty amazing task to attempt, but they are doing it and are currently up to Volume 20 - available now in Australian shops. I'll probably stop buying them once they get to episode 300 - because, as I said before, the best years were the early years.  Try as much as I can, I do not think Joan Ferguson was as creepy as she was supposed to come across. Nor was she as tough as Vera Bennett.Thank god for Prisoner. Watch it and see why it is a cult classic. To me it is because it showed good storylines, effective actors and takes us all back to a time in Australia where things were more carefree.",3,Selected episodes,1200441600,"01 16, 2008",2008,1772,"['DVD', 'package', 'i.e', 'Set', '2', 'came', 'out', 'Australia', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'different', 'cover', 'one', 'seen', 'Amazon', 'showing', 'mean', 'Prison', 'Warden', 'Joan', 'Ferguson', 'played', 'Maggie', 'Kirkpatrick', '2', 'first', 'set', 'nothing', 'more', 'selected', 'episodes', '692', 'epsiodes', 'shot', 'period', '1979', '1986', 'least', 'set', 'really', 'early', 'episodes', 'first', 'set', 'was', 'pretty', 'pathetic', 'included', 'episodes', '300', 'onwards', 'being', 'labelled', 'early', 'years', 'least', 'Set', '2', 'get', 'see', 'where', 'started', 'inclusion', 'episodes', '1-4.I', 'always', 'preferred', 'earlier', 'years', 'opinion', 'first', 'mean', 'Prison', 'Warden', 'Vera', 'Bennett', 'played', 'Fiona', 'Spence', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'odd', 'how', 'first', 'set', 'only', 'included', 'one', 'episode', 'showing', 'her.While', 'Set', '2', 'definitely', 'improvement', 'Set', '1', 'be', 'said', 'episodes', 'were', 'picked', 'DVD', 'distributor', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'favourites', 'claim', 'Who', 'really', 'are', 'best', '692', 'episodes', 'why', 'year', 'ago', 'DVD', 'company', 'Australia', 'started', 'releasing', 'single', 'episode', '25', 'episodes', 'volume', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'task', 'attempt', 'are', 'doing', 'are', 'currently', 'Volume', '20', 'available', 'now', 'Australian', 'shops', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'stop', 'buying', 'once', 'get', 'episode', '300', 'because', 'said', 'best', 'years', 'were', 'early', 'years', 'Try', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Joan', 'Ferguson', 'was', 'as', 'creepy', 'was', 'supposed', 'come', 'was', 'as', 'tough', 'Vera', 'Bennett.Thank', 'god', 'Prisoner', 'Watch', 'see', 'why', 'cult', 'classic', 'showed', 'good', 'storylines', 'effective', 'actors', 'back', 'time', 'Australia', 'where', 'things', 'were', 'more', 'carefree']","Prisoner Cell Block H, Set 2"
