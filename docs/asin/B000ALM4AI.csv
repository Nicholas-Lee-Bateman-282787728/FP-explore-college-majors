927633,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000ALM4AI,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 3]","That's right.  I do things in pairs.  After doubly watching the regular version of ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" as well as listening to the audio commentary, I decided to watch the Catherine Hardwicke full-fledged Hollywood version of Peralta's voice.  With two audio commentaries, plenty of behind the scenes information, as well as a cornucopia of in-your-face skateboarding, I believe I have seen every angle of this film - from Catherine's vision to the completely misrepresented time frame for these three young friends that changed history.  This is the ""unleashed/unrated"" version, and you are in for a treat.  Catherine and team left no stone unturned and brought us the Z-Boys with loud 70s music, tween issues, and a story that was connected with the feeblest of string.  For those reading this review, I am going to compare the two films - why?  Not only because I can, but because these two - both ""Lords of Dogtown"" and ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" are companion films.  All due in part to an issue in Rolling Stone magazine, these two films were allowed a green light - one was made with heart, passion, and a sense of nostalgia, while the other (still using the same scribe), was made with the green of the dollar deeply in mind.  It isn't the fact that I disliked ""Lords of Dogtown"", I just finished watching it three times, it was the fact that I think it over amplifies the truth and dissolves the passion that Peralta created with his documentary.Hardwicke, whom many of you remember as the brain child behind the fabulously gritty drama ""thirteen"", helms this project with the same gumption that she enlisted for her prior film.  Using some of the same crew, same filming technique, and an overhyped budget this film demonstrates that even the dirtiest of teen struggles can be glossed over to Hollywood standards.  Egos aside, we are handed a Hardwicke special which includes (but is not limited to) shirtless tween hunks, a sense of invincibility over adults, a rockin' good soundtrack, a time frame that breaks all borders, and finally two actual stars that would be used to introduce an older audience that may not be familiar with teen main characters to pack theaters and make sure someone's child gets a college tuition.  I am harsh with this film - again, why? - because this was supposed to be a group that was anti-establishment, anti-normality, anti-boundaries, yet seemed to fit well within this Hollywood box.  I witnessed the innovators of a generation, sans Jay Adams, sell their souls for corporate glory.  Sure, they may have wanted their story to be told for a new generation of skaters, but there could have been a better way to portray this creativity, struggle, and eventual breakdown of friendships.  This was supposed to be like the grittier ""Stand by Me"", when instead it felt like Disney was an independent benefactor.I thought Hardwicke's choice of cinematography, camera angle, and story placement seemed dated.  She did this already in ""thirteen"", I wanted her to explore more boundaries, stronger moments, and really define herself as a director.  Instead, I watched three times (two audio commentaries plague this disc) a director mimic their already golden film - even the choice of casting some of the same actors from ""thirteen"".  After watching ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"", I was prepared to see a better side to their story.  I wanted Hardwicke to take me places that Peralta's minimal budget couldn't.  With Peralta writing the story, I didn't think he would allow anything to slip by.  I was wrong.  His choice to create small, more insignificant characters to help build credibility in our central three characters was pathetic.  I wanted Peralta to interact with everyone from the Zephyr skate team, not just Jay, Tony, and himself.  This was a collaborative effort from everyone, and not giving everyone their moment in the spotlight just seemed to make me grumpy.  I loved hearing everyone's voice during the ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" film, and it hurt to just be focused on three while others were equally as successful.  If this were the case, we should have had only one story - instead of trying to intermingle everything together.  Stories were dropped, players were disrespected, and the true story became a muddled mess of semi-truth and Hollywood truth.  Our actors did what they could, but were shaky as the main characters.  John Robinson felt like he was back filming ""Elephant 2"", I just couldn't see him as any other character.  Emile Hirsch was goofy, while I realized that Jay Adams was crazy (as we all know someone from our past like him), he just came off as arrogant and acting like he was a tormented teen.  His scene on the burned pier with Heath was laughable at best.  Victor, as Tony Alva, didn't carry the weight he was supposed to.  He wasn't the best of the group, but he was the strongest, but Victor couldn't put any strength behind him.  The three players did a decent job, but it was obvious from the opening scene that they weren't going to win awards for their portrayals.I must compliment Hardwicke for her choice of Heath Ledger as Skip.  From the documentary to the silver screen, Ledger did an amazing job of bringing this pivotal character to life.  His voice, his mannerisms, his taut demeanor was exactly like watching the documentary.  I loved it.  It gave me faith that Heath could pull off The Joker in the upcoming ""Batman"" film.  Alas, I cannot say the same for Rebecca De Mornay (who needs to do some independent work to get back into the business) and Johnny Knoxville.  He is growing into an actor, but this was not the right character for him to tackle.  Tony's financier needed to be meaner, pushier, and darker - none of which came from funnyman Knoxville.  Everyone else involved seemed to hit their stride, as I enjoyed seeing some of my favorites playing cameo roles throughout the film.  I must give credit to Hardwicke here as well for really bringing some (not all) of these guys into the project - I just wish she would have listened to them more when developing her style.  She should have at least used all of them in the commentary, by just using Peralta and Alva, we knew who her favorites were.  Where was Skip's side of the story?Overall, I cannot say that this film compares in anyway, shape, or form to the documentary that Peralta created.  I know that he wrote this film too, but it was obvious that one was written with the soul and the other was developed for the money.  ""Dogtown  and Z-Boys"" spoke for itself, giving us a raw taste of what life was like back in the 70s on Venice Beach and in innovation that the surfers had for bringing a new style of sport into the limelight.  I loved the music again, ""Maggie May"" near the end really struck a chord for me and developed Skip into this true player.  I cannot suggest this film to friends because I will be devoting my time to suggesting the more impassioned ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" - especially the audio commentary - to them.  I say watch the documentary, unless you like your stories with glossier endings.Grade: **  out of *****",3,"Lords of something, but I am not so sure about Dogtown...",1187222400,"08 16,

927634,A1AP3A4UW8OJFV,B000ALM4AI,Andre 2015,"[28, 30]","After slowly getting over the news of Heath Ledger's death, I wanted to watch him again in one of his movies. Although I like Brokeback Mountain, I prefer this one.It's the story of the Z-Boys, four teenage surfer friends who in the mid seventies take up skate boarding and thus change the world of sports forever.Heath is ""Far Out!"" Skip, a surfer and surf store owner who is the first to recognize the kids' talents. He pushes them (calling him a manager would be a little too much), and makes them grow into what they are to become.More or less drunk for most of the time and always open for yet another trick to spin off a little cash for himself on the side, he cannot hold them once the success and fame hits.Big managers' promises of fast cars, the prettiest girls and cash in adundance pull the boys out of his loose grip.Their friendship starts breaking apart as ambition, jealousy, girls and greedy managers take over.It is only when one of them (who got left behind) falls seriously ill, that the boys get back together and rediscover what their friendship is all about.Starring Emile Hirsch as the enigmatic and anger driven Jay, Victor Rasuk as the ambitious Tony Alva and John Robinson as Stacy Peralta (who also wrote the screenplay).Great camerawork, both on and off the skates, terrific acting, solid directing and wonderful production and set design.The film and the actors do a great job in transmitting the fun and thrill of skating.My favorite scene is Tyson, The Wonder Dog, the fun loving skating bulldog who simply can't get enough of the sport(also as an extended scene in the special features - he was not trained to do this but took up skating by himself!).The dvd's picture quality is good, even in the dark and during the rides.The extended cut has four minutes more. The only reason these were cut were probably the use of too many four letter words, but I wouldn't want to miss them.Great movie with a wonderful sad and funny Heath Ledger.",5,"Beautiful and wild, co-starring Heath Ledger",1201824000,"02 1, 2008",2008,1970,"['slowly', 'getting', 'news', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'death', 'wanted', 'watch', 'again', 'one', 'movies', 'like', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'prefer', 'one.It', 'story', 'Z-Boys', 'four', 'teenage', 'surfer', 'friends', 'who', 'mid', 'seventies', 'take', 'up', 'skate', 'boarding', 'thus', 'change', 'world', 'sports', 'forever.Heath', 'Far', 'Out', 'Skip', 'surfer', 'surf', 'store', 'owner', 'who', 'first', 'recognize', 'kids', 'talents', 'calling', 'manager', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'grow', 'what', 'are', 'become.More', 'less', 'drunk', 'most', 'time', 'always', 'open', 'yet', 'trick', 'spin', 'off', 'little', 'cash', 'side', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'once', 'success', 'fame', 'hits.Big', 'managers', 'promises', 'fast', 'cars', 'prettiest', 'girls', 'cash', 'adundance', 'pull', 'boys', 'loose', 'grip.Their', 'friendship', 'breaking', 'apart', 'ambition', 'jealousy', 'girls', 'greedy', 'managers', 'take', 'over.It', 'only', 'when', 'one', 'who', 'got', 'left', 'seriously', 'ill', 'boys', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'rediscover', 'what', 'friendship', 'about.Starring', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'enigmatic', 'anger', 'driven', 'Jay', 'Victor', 'Rasuk', 'ambitious', 'Tony', 'Alva', 'John', 'Robinson', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', '.Great', 'camerawork', 'skates', 'terrific', 'acting', 'solid', 'directing', 'wonderful', 'production', 'set', 'design.The', 'film', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'transmitting', 'fun', 'thrill', 'skating.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'Tyson', 'Wonder', 'Dog', 'fun', 'loving', 'skating', 'bulldog', 'who', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'sport', 'also', 'extended', 'scene', 'special', 'features', 'was', 'not', 'trained', 'do', 'took', 'up', 'skating', '.The', 'dvd', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', 'even', 'dark', 'rides.The', 'extended', 'cut', 'four', 'minutes', 'more', 'only', 'reason', 'were', 'cut', 'were', 'probably', 'use', 'too', 'many', 'four', 'letter', 'words', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'them.Great', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'sad', 'funny', 'Heath', 'Ledger']",N/A

927642,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B000ALM4AI,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 2]","LORDS OF DOGTOWN is both a coming-of-age saga, exploring three young men who take three very different paths, and it is also a skate-umentary, if you will. Due to a drought in Venice, California, the teenage skateboarders discover the joys of skating drained swimming pools. This and other styles of extreme skateboarding are depicted with great care, and also sheer joy and excitement. And finally, there is also the story of the surf shop would-be mogul who forms them into a skate team, but ultimately tries to exploit their talent and is left behind. The part of Skip was played by Heath Ledger, and he really immersed himself in his role. I didn't know it was him until after his untimely death, someone mentioned it to me. He looked totally different, and, like Sean Penn will sometimes do, was bravely unconcerned about whether people would like him, or like his character, and he also didn't seem concerned with his looks. He was a skuzzy skankster, indeed.The three main characters, Stacy Peralta (John Robinson, Elephant), Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch, The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys), and Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk, Raising Victor Vargas) are on three different paths. Stacy is very serious about the sport, and works at it. At first he isn't asked to join the team because Skip feels he is not an ""outlaw."" Tony Alva becomes a ""star,"" but has to realize that his entourage of hangers-on and partyers doesn't have his best interest at heart. Jay Adams is shown as the instigator, the spark that ignited the radical new style of skating. One of the funniest moments is when an ad exec from Wham-O! tries to get him to shill for Slinky! He attempts to sing the Slinky! Theme, but quickly realizes that it is not for him. But then he becomes a thug. This may have been slanted a bit, to make for a more dramatic story. In bonus footage, the real Jay Adams complains that he actually accomplished a lot more than mere thuggery with his life. The script was written by Stacy Peralta, and his character was a hard working and dedicated skater who didn't let the temptations thrown at the young stars divert him from the path to success. I wouldn't argue with that, but since he wrote the script he could've sanitized it. I would have liked to have seen him act out a little more, maybe throw a few punches. Something to show that characters are not all good or bad, but everyone has parts of both.Directed by Catherine Hardwicke (Thirteen) The Lords of Dogtown shreds and thrashes, like a good skate movie should. In bonus footage it is revealed that while filming the skate sequences in the drained swimming pool, Hardwicke got so enthralled with the shredding action that she fell in, broke a few bones, and had to be rushed to the hospital. As a director she showed much better judgement in her choice of the little details that define an era. Like when the skaters are partyin' the skater girls perform a dance routine choreographed to Cher's ""Half Breed."" What a time it was, the mid 70s, for the sport of skateboarding. The gnarly cast includes Rebecca De Mornay (Risky Business), Johnny Knoxville (Jackass: The Movie), and Nikki Reed (Thirteen).Dogtown and Z-BoysThirteenCandyBlackrockBrokeback Mountain (Full Screen Edition)Ned KellyCasanovaThe Dangerous Lives of Altar BoysElephant: A Film By Gus Van SantRaising Victor Vargas",4,"Thrash and Shred, Heath and Hardwicke",1203897600,"02 25, 2008",2008,3336,"['LORDS', 'OF', 'DOGTOWN', 'coming-of-age', 'saga', 'exploring', 'three', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'take', 'three', 'very', 'different', 'paths', 'also', 'skate-umentary', 'will', 'Due', 'drought', 'Venice', 'California', 'teenage', 'skateboarders', 'discover', 'joys', 'skating', 'drained', 'swimming', 'pools', 'other', 'styles', 'extreme', 'skateboarding', 'are', 'depicted', 'great', 'care', 'also', 'sheer', 'joy', 'excitement', 'finally', 'also', 'story', 'surf', 'shop', 'would-be', 'mogul', 'who', 'skate', 'team', 'ultimately', 'exploit', 'talent', 'left', 'part', 'Skip', 'was', 'played', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'really', 'immersed', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'untimely', 'death', 'someone', 'mentioned', 'looked', 'totally', 'different', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'will', 'sometimes', 'do', 'was', 'bravely', 'unconcerned', 'people', 'would', 'like', 'character', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'concerned', 'looks', 'was', 'skuzzy', 'skankster', 'indeed.The', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', 'John', 'Robinson', 'Elephant', 'Jay', 'Adams', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Dangerous', 'Lives', 'Altar', 'Boys', 'Tony', 'Alva', 'Victor', 'Rasuk', 'Raising', 'Victor', 'Vargas', 'are', 'three', 'different', 'paths', 'Stacy', 'very', 'serious', 'sport', 'first', ""n't"", 'asked', 'join', 'team', 'Skip', 'feels', 'not', 'outlaw', 'Tony', 'Alva', 'star', 'realize', 'entourage', 'hangers-on', 'partyers', ""n't"", 'have', 'best', 'interest', 'heart', 'Jay', 'Adams', 'shown', 'instigator', 'spark', 'ignited', 'radical', 'new', 'style', 'skating', 'One', 'funniest', 'moments', 'when', 'ad', 'exec', 'Wham-O', 'tries', 'get', 'shill', 'Slinky', 'sing', 'Slinky', 'Theme', 'quickly', 'not', 'then', 'thug', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'slanted', 'bit', 'make', 'more', 'dramatic', 'story', 'bonus', 'footage', 'real', 'Jay', 'Adams', 'actually', 'accomplished', 'lot', 'more', 'mere', 'thuggery', 'life', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', 'character', 'was', 'hard', 'working', 'dedicated', 'skater', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'temptations', 'thrown', 'young', 'stars', 'divert', 'path', 'success', 'would', ""n't"", 'argue', 'wrote', 'script', 'could', ""'ve"", 'sanitized', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'act', 'out', 'little', 'more', 'maybe', 'throw', 'few', 'punches', 'Something', 'show', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'all', 'good', 'bad', 'everyone', 'parts', 'both.Directed', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'Thirteen', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'shreds', 'thrashes', 'good', 'skate', 'movie', 'should', 'bonus', 'footage', 'revealed', 'filming', 'skate', 'sequences', 'drained', 'swimming', 'pool', 'Hardwicke', 'got', 'so', 'enthralled', 'shredding', 'action', 'fell', 'broke', 'few', 'bones', 'had', 'be', 'rushed', 'hospital', 'director', 'showed', 'much', 'better', 'judgement', 'choice', 'little', 'details', 'define', 'era', 'when', 'skaters', 'are', 'partyin', 'skater', 'girls', 'perform', 'dance', 'routine', 'choreographed', 'Cher', 'Half', 'Breed', 'What', 'time', 'was', 'mid', '70s', 'sport', 'skateboarding', 'gnarly', 'cast', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'Risky', 'Business', 'Johnny', 'Knoxville', 'Jackass', 'Movie', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'Thirteen', '.Dogtown', 'Z-BoysThirteenCandyBlackrockBrokeback', 'Mountain', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'Ned', 'KellyCasanovaThe', 'Dangerous', 'Altar', 'BoysElephant', 'Film', 'Gus', 'Van', 'SantRaising', 'Victor', 'Vargas']",N/A

I'm 48 now, but I can clearly remember the skateboarding scene back in the 70's, since my brother and I were afficionados.  Even back in the NYC area and Jersey, skateboarding caught on bigtime because of the media attention brought on by skate giants like Tony Alva and Stacy Peralta.  I can remember the many skateboard shops that opened up, even in music/head shops or bicycle shops as a 'side business'.  We then even built our own 'half pipes' in our backyards, and ate up every issue of 'Skateboarder' magazine.  We found out where skateboard parks opened up, and had our parents drive us there (before we were old enough to get a driver's license).  We pored over, and debated about Bahne, G&S, Alva, and Banzai boards.  Ditto regarding which wheels and trucks were the best (I liked Bennett, Tracker, Red Rider, Green Alligator, and Bonez).

927645,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000ALM4AI,Cubist,"[14, 15]","Dogtown and Z-Boys was a hugely successful documentary chronicling a group of wild skateboarders in Venice Beach, California in 1970s. Naturally, Hollywood got interested and wanted to make a fictional version (because hey, no one watches docs, right?) with Fred Dirst (of Limp Bizkit fame) directing and David Fincher producing. Fortunately, someone came to their senses and Dirst was out with Fincher taking over but the budget for his vision was too large. So, the studio opted for a low budget take with independent film darling Catherine Hardwicke, fresh from the success of Thirteen, taking over as director. In an effort to keep it real, Stacy Peralta, who made the Z-Boys doc, wrote the screenplay for Lords of Dogtown and worked closely with Hardwicke in order to remain true to what he and his friends went through all those years ago.Thankfully, the film's producers didn't raid the WB cabinet for the young cast. Instead, they got Hirsch (from The Girl Next Door), Victor Rasuk (from indie fave Raising Victor Vargas) and John Robinson (from Gus Van Sant's Elephant) who have some actual acting chops but not a high enough profile so as to distract. They disappear into their roles as does, surprisingly, high profile actor, Heath Ledger. He does an excellent job of becoming his character, one of the Zephyr skate shop owners who is a burnt out drunk but has vision and tries to protect his team of young skaters.The trailers for this movie totally misrepresented it as an over-processed, heavily-edited piece of lunchmeat. Instead, Lords of Dogtown perfectly evokes the times it depicts with unerring authenticity. It portrays skaters as they were back then - stylish and below the radar, just before the sport took off to the wildly popular institution that it is now.Lords of Dogtown shows how fame eventually broke up the Z-Boys. It was inevitable. These kids came from nothing and were suddenly thrust into the spotlight and thrown all kinds of money at them. Alva and Peralta became hugely popular and went corporate, constantly competing with each other while Adams stayed true to his roots and walked away from it all because he was in it for the love of skating and the thrill of the ride. This film will bring back a lot of memories for people who grew up and skated during these years, making this movie more than just a simple retread of the Z-Boys documentary.There is an audio commentary by director Catherine Hardwicke and actors John Robinson, Victor Rasuk and Emile Hirsch. The actors dish all kinds of good anecdotes about filming in this engaging and informative track.Also included is an additional commentary with original Z-Boys Stacy Peralta and Tony Alva. The movie is clearly a trip down memory lane for these guys as they share all sorts of memories and stories from that time in their lives. This is a laid-back, engaging track by guys who were actually there back in the day.""The Making of Lords of Dogtown"" is a 30 minute look at how this film came together. Best of all, we get to see footage of the three lead actors learning how to surf and skate. They spent over two months training before filming any scenes.""Dogtown Cameos"" showcases all the real people from back in the day that Hardwicke snuck into the backgrounds of scenes or even gave speaking parts. This featurette identifies where they are in the movie, who they are and then lets them talk about their experiences back then and now.There are nine deleted and extended scenes totaling 19 minutes. This includes more footage of the Zephyr shop and additional bits of Sid and Stacy's home lives.Also included are seven featurettes that provide additional insights into the filmmaking process, including many of the scrapes and spills the cast and their stunt doubles endured. There is more excellent skating footage that was cut out and make-up tests for the cast and their stunt doubles.""Gag Reel"" features standard footage of the cast goofing around on set.There are ""Storyboard Comparisons"" for three scenes from the movie. They cut back and forth from the drawings to the finished product so you can see how close they resemble each other.Finally, there is a music video for ""Nervous Breakdown"" by Rise Against that features the band playing with clips from the movie included.",5,The trailers for this movie were misleading...,1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,4285,"['Dogtown', 'Z-Boys', 'was', 'hugely', 'successful', 'documentary', 'chronicling', 'group', 'wild', 'skateboarders', 'Venice', 'Beach', 'California', '1970s', 'Naturally', 'Hollywood', 'got', 'interested', 'wanted', 'make', 'fictional', 'version', 'hey', 'one', 'docs', 'right', 'Fred', 'Dirst', 'Limp', 'Bizkit', 'fame', 'directing', 'David', 'Fincher', 'producing', 'Fortunately', 'someone', 'came', 'senses', 'Dirst', 'was', 'out', 'Fincher', 'taking', 'over', 'budget', 'vision', 'was', 'too', 'large', 'So', 'studio', 'opted', 'low', 'budget', 'take', 'independent', 'film', 'darling', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'fresh', 'success', 'Thirteen', 'taking', 'over', 'director', 'effort', 'keep', 'real', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', 'who', 'made', 'Z-Boys', 'doc', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'worked', 'closely', 'Hardwicke', 'order', 'remain', 'true', 'what', 'friends', 'went', 'years', 'ago.Thankfully', 'film', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'raid', 'WB', 'cabinet', 'young', 'cast', 'Instead', 'got', 'Hirsch', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'Victor', 'Rasuk', 'indie', 'fave', 'Raising', 'Victor', 'Vargas', 'John', 'Robinson', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Elephant', 'who', 'have', 'actual', 'acting', 'chops', 'not', 'high', 'enough', 'profile', 'so', 'distract', 'disappear', 'roles', 'surprisingly', 'high', 'profile', 'actor', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'excellent', 'job', 'becoming', 'character', 'one', 'Zephyr', 'skate', 'shop', 'owners', 'who', 'burnt', 'out', 'drunk', 'vision', 'tries', 'protect', 'team', 'young', 'skaters.The', 'trailers', 'movie', 'totally', 'misrepresented', 'over-processed', 'heavily-edited', 'piece', 'lunchmeat', 'Instead', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'perfectly', 'times', 'unerring', 'authenticity', 'skaters', 'were', 'back', 'then', 'stylish', 'radar', 'just', 'sport', 'took', 'off', 'wildly', 'popular', 'institution', 'now.Lords', 'Dogtown', 'how', 'fame', 'eventually', 'broke', 'up', 'Z-Boys', 'was', 'inevitable', 'kids', 'came', 'nothing', 'were', 'suddenly', 'thrust', 'spotlight', 'thrown', 'kinds', 'money', 'Alva', 'Peralta', 'became', 'hugely', 'popular', 'went', 'corporate', 'constantly', 'competing', 'other', 'Adams', 'stayed', 'true', 'roots', 'walked', 'away', 'was', 'love', 'skating', 'thrill', 'ride', 'film', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'lot', 'memories', 'people', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'skated', 'years', 'making', 'movie', 'more', 'just', 'simple', 'retread', 'Z-Boys', 'documentary.There', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'actors', 'John', 'Robinson', 'Victor', 'Rasuk', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'actors', 'dish', 'kinds', 'good', 'anecdotes', 'filming', 'engaging', 'informative', 'track.Also', 'included', 'additional', 'commentary', 'original', 'Z-Boys', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', 'Tony', 'Alva', 'movie', 'clearly', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'guys', 'share', 'sorts', 'memories', 'stories', 'time', 'lives', 'laid-back', 'engaging', 'track', 'guys', 'who', 'were', 'actually', 'back', 'day', 'Making', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', '30', 'minute', 'look', 'how', 'film', 'came', 'together', 'Best', 'get', 'see', 'footage', 'three', 'lead', 'actors', 'learning', 'how', 'surf', 'skate', 'spent', 'two', 'months', 'training', 'filming', 'scenes', 'Dogtown', 'Cameos', 'real', 'people', 'back', 'day', 'Hardwicke', 'snuck', 'backgrounds', 'scenes', 'even', 'gave', 'speaking', 'parts', 'featurette', 'where', 'are', 'movie', 'who', 'are', 'then', 'talk', 'experiences', 'back', 'then', 'now.There', 'are', 'nine', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'totaling', '19', 'minutes', 'more', 'footage', 'Zephyr', 'shop', 'additional', 'bits', 'Sid', 'Stacy', 'home', 'lives.Also', 'included', 'are', 'seven', 'featurettes', 'provide', 'additional', 'insights', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'including', 'many', 'scrapes', 'cast', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'endured', 'more', 'excellent', 'skating', 'footage', 'was', 'cut', 'out', 'make-up', 'tests', 'cast', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'Gag', 'Reel', 'standard', 'footage', 'cast', 'goofing', 'around', 'set.There', 'are', 'Storyboard', 'Comparisons', 'three', 'scenes', 'movie', 'cut', 'back', 'forth', 'drawings', 'finished', 'product', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'close', 'resemble', 'other.Finally', 'music', 'video', 'Nervous', 'Breakdown', 'Rise', 'Against', 'band', 'playing', 'clips', 'movie', 'included']",N/A

927648,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B000ALM4AI,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[4, 9]","I loved the ""Dogtown And Z-Boys"" documentary that came out a couple of years ago, which dealt with the same subject -- looking at the Venice, California skate rats who pioneered modern skateboarding -- but this feature film, scripted by one of the Z-Boys, is pretty lame.  Sure, it evokes the era of the mid-1970s in loving, lavish detail, and it delves a little deeper into the psychology and personal stories of the kids involved in the scene that surrounded the fabled Zephyr surf shop, but it's poorly directed and has, at heart, a weak, hackneyed script that relies too heavily on the assumption that viewers already have an intimate knowledge of surf and skate lore.  We're supposed to know who Tony Alva and the other characters are, and be so in awe of seeing them portrayed onscreen that we won't notice that this film is basically an ABC After School Special with a little added drug use and gratuitous juvenile delinquency to spice things up.Meanwhile, the actors and the screenwriters try way too hard to impress upon us how raw and ""street"" these guys were, and the dramas and conflicts between them are drawn in the broadest, most melodramatic terms, contributing to a sense of cheesiness that overtakes the story.  Also, there are weird and unnecessary anachronisms, such as the kids throwing gang signs during a photo shoot, or calling some guy a ""bitch,"" which are products of the post-'80s hip-hop scene, rather than Jimmy Carter-era stoner culture.  Even less understandable is the loosey-goosey presentation of LA's fabled punk scene... I mean, what's up with them going to a Black Flag show in 1977?  The band had barely formed that very year, and LA's punk heyday was still a couple of years away from the mid-'70s timeframe this film was set in.Similarly, skate culture isn't really well explained, either -- we see the Zephyr team doing stuff which apparently blows everyone's mind, but we don't really know why, or what it was they were doing that was so cool.  (The recreations of the championship shows that they made their reps in were constructed with lavish attention to detail, but the skating itself looks pretty dull -- were the shows and the moves really that lame, or is this just poorly filmed?)  The character development seems shallow and leaden, and the conflicts between freedom and fame, etc., etc., are blandly presented and trite.

927655,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000ALM4AI,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","There is not a whole lot of story to the cinematic adaptation of Stacy Peralta's memoir of his experience in the mid 1970s with the popularization of skateboarding. Nor is there a whole lot of character development in these teenagers addicted to skateboarding among other things.  But what LORDS OF DOGTOWN is, is a spectacular cinematic excursion into the risks and exaltations of the sport of championship skateboarding: watching the thrills of these kids doing dangerous leaps, twists, airborne stunts in empty swimming pools is truly entertaining.The film is set in 1975 when surfing was all the rage, especially in Venice, CA where one Skip (Heath Ledger) owns a surfboard shop.  He befriends a scrappy bunch of teenagers who live their lives for skateboarding along Venice Beach and in private homes where empty swimming pools (this was the era of water conservation!) provide provocative arenas for their skills. The lead among them is Jay (Emile Hirsch) who is out to explore new challenges and when he and his confreres Stacy (John Robinson), Tony (Victor Rusak), and Sid (Michael Angarano) demonstrate the way skateboarding pleases crowds and girls, Skip cashes in on the enterprise by forming Zephyr, a club for championship skateboarding and enters his groupie into the competition circuit.  As the boys gain fame they are tempted away from Skip into higher profile gigs and the group disintegrates only to reform after a tragedy befalls one of them.The screenplay was written by Stacy Peralta (and that may explain why his role is a bit too goodie-two-shoes when compared to the antics of the other boys) and while there isn't a lot of dialogue of significance, there is a lot of communication very much in tune with the historic time of the action.  Catherine Hardwicke has an amazing sense of the teenage attitude and vulnerability and keeps the story 'skating' with staggering momentum.  The cast is uniformly fine: Heath Ledger shows he can be something other than the Hollywood leading man type and Emile Hirsch, Victor Rusak, and John Robinson are all on target with their roles.  Newcomer Michael Angarano shows the promise in this film that resulted in his superb role in the current 'One Last Thing' - his screen presence is magnetic.In all this is a recreation of  a wild period of life in a bizarre era staged in a rickety old version of Venice, CA and it gives the viewer a slice of atmosphere that will likely not be re-created as well.

927664,A202FGBQHO5638,B000ALM4AI,L. Alper,"[1, 1]","Watching ""The Lords of Dogtown"" makes the viewer realize how critical the director is to a film. Catherine Hardwicke, whose only previous directorial credit was ""Thirteen"" has done such a perfect job realizing Stacy Peralta's screenplay that the thought of any other director tackling the film makes you cringe.Of course, Hardwicke had plenty of help. Tony Alva was involved in almost every aspect of this film, from coaching the actors on skateboarding to providing dialogue he remembered from nearly 30 years ago. Peralta was there, as were many of the original Dogtown skaters including Jim Muir & Alan Sarlo. But it was Hardwicke's decision to utilize these resources & not to try to recast their lives in a rosier light that shows how valuable she was to this production.Watching the DVD of Lords of Dogtown allows the viewer to really analyze the performances & editorial choices that may have slipped by in the theatre. For instance, Emile Hirsch's portrayal of Jay Adams can only be truly appreciated when you see him & the ""real"" Jay sitting side-by-side in one of the extras. Then Hirsch's performance seems almost spooky it is so accurate. John Robinson captures Stacy Peralta's mix of shyness & determination, good boy/ rebel down to a ""T"" while, although I initially had reservations about Victor Rasuk as Tony, no less an authority than Peralta himself says that Rasuk re-creates Alva's intensity & competitiveness flawlessly.The grittiness of early 70's Venice/Santa Monica is brought back to life along with Pacific Ocean Park Pier. In the extras you'll find out how much of POP is CGI & how much physical. The clothes are perfect; Hang Ten shirts, OP's with briefs poking out the top, tube socks & Vans...the costume department doesn't hit a sour note. The skating sequences are edited so well that it takes Tony & Stacy talking on the commentary track to clue the viewer in on when it's the actor & when it's a stunt double (or Tony or Stacy themselves) doing the skating.The commentary with Tony & Stacy makes buying the DVD truly worthwhile. It's amazing how many of the scenes *really* happened as the film shows, and were not just convenient tools for a Hollywood portrayal. Their comments truly bring an extra dimension to Lords of Dogtown. Other extras include clips of cameos played by the original Zboys, deleted scenes, recreating POP & the West Coast of the 1970's, Catherine Hardwicke's commentary & a music video.This is really a great film, and for anyone who enjoyed ""Dogtown & Zboys"" a must-own. Definitely get the Unrated version; although the added bits total only about 4 minutes, they add to realism of the film, being the pieces that had to be cut to achieve a PG-13 rating (such as Jay taking a hit off of a joint).

927665,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000ALM4AI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 7]","Having seen the trailers for ""Lords of Dogtown"" I was motivated to check out the 2001 documentary ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" while waiting for this 2005 film to come out on DVD.  The two projects are related by more than subject matter since Stacy Peralta, one of the original Z-Boys, directed the documentary and wrote the script for the feature film.  From the documentary I understood how a bunch of surfers who could not surf all day, the invention of urethane wheels for skateboards, the thrill seeking of surfing the Dogtown pier, and the California drought of the late 1970s that emptied pools all combined to create professional skateboarding.  Having this background knowledge both worked for and against my enjoyment of this film.The big difference between the documentary and the film is that in the latter director Catherine Hardwicke (""Thirteen"") is as interested in how the Z-Boys fell apart as in how everything came together.  Skip (Heath Ledger) of the Zephyr store is the Pied Piper, but the Z-Boys are the stars.  The focus is on three of them: Stacy Peralta (John Robinson) is the quiet and thoughtful one, Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch) is the angry and impulsive one, and Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk) is the flashy and sexy one.  The problem is that once the Z-Boys conquer the world they take on each other.  The world helps, because there are companies and con men alike who are willing to pay the Z-Boys big bucks for endorsements and gigs.  There are also trophies being handed out once skateboarding becomes a professional sport, and competitiveness comes between them as well.Of course in this day and age of X-treme sports it is difficult to enjoy the simpler times when doing 360s on a skateboard or making it over the light in a swimming pool was the ultimate experience.  When ""Lords of Dogtown"" gets to the world championship competitions and it seems the goal is just to see high you can ride on a board the action becomes rather mundane.  But when the boys are in the swimming pools and the camera is right behind them, is when this film really works, because that is when you have your best sense of the skill and the joy of skateboarding.  Every time Hardwicke shows montages of the boys skating this entire world makes perfect sense.The extras on this DVD are a big plus.  There are two excellent commentary tracks, the first by the director and the three young actors, and the second by Peralta and Tony Alva.  You know there is going to be a preference for the later as the original Z-Boys talk about what really happened, but as the screenwriter Peralta also talks about the changes Hardwicke wanted to make (like making Tony's sister Stacy's girlfriend), and the Z-Boys pass their judgments.  But since Robinson, Hirsch and Rasuk did a lot of their own stunts and took their share of spills (and worse), they have their own war stories to tell about making the film.  I ended up replaying the movie in segments so that I could do first one commentary track and then the other rather than just doing one and then the other.""The Making of 'Lords of Dogtown'"" featurette fits in well with the commentary tracks, and then we have a whole bunch of other extras including ""Dogged on Dogtown"" (accidents on the set), a look at all of the cameos in the film, a bunch of profane outtakes, and a great bit on a self-taught skateboarding bulldog, which may well be the highlight on the DVD.  So even after you have watched the movie and done both of the commentary tracks there are another couple of hours worth of goodies to enjoy, so even if you are somewhat disappointed in the movie you will be impressed by the DVD.",4,The documentary was better but the DVD extras here are gnarly,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,3635,"['Having', 'seen', 'trailers', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'was', 'motivated', 'check', 'out', '2001', 'documentary', 'Dogtown', 'Z-Boys', 'waiting', '2005', 'film', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'two', 'projects', 'are', 'related', 'more', 'subject', 'matter', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', 'one', 'original', 'Z-Boys', 'directed', 'documentary', 'wrote', 'script', 'feature', 'film', 'documentary', 'understood', 'how', 'bunch', 'surfers', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'surf', 'day', 'invention', 'urethane', 'wheels', 'skateboards', 'thrill', 'seeking', 'surfing', 'Dogtown', 'pier', 'California', 'drought', 'late', '1970s', 'emptied', 'pools', 'combined', 'create', 'professional', 'skateboarding', 'Having', 'background', 'worked', 'enjoyment', 'film.The', 'big', 'difference', 'documentary', 'film', 'latter', 'director', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'Thirteen', 'as', 'interested', 'how', 'Z-Boys', 'fell', 'apart', 'how', 'everything', 'came', 'together', 'Skip', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Zephyr', 'store', 'Pied', 'Piper', 'Z-Boys', 'are', 'stars', 'focus', 'three', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', 'John', 'Robinson', 'quiet', 'thoughtful', 'one', 'Jay', 'Adams', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'angry', 'impulsive', 'one', 'Tony', 'Alva', 'Victor', 'Rasuk', 'flashy', 'sexy', 'one', 'problem', 'once', 'Z-Boys', 'conquer', 'world', 'take', 'other', 'world', 'are', 'companies', 'con', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'pay', 'Z-Boys', 'big', 'bucks', 'endorsements', 'gigs', 'are', 'also', 'trophies', 'being', 'handed', 'out', 'once', 'skateboarding', 'professional', 'sport', 'competitiveness', 'well.Of', 'course', 'day', 'age', 'X-treme', 'sports', 'difficult', 'enjoy', 'simpler', 'times', 'when', 'doing', '360s', 'skateboard', 'making', 'light', 'swimming', 'pool', 'was', 'ultimate', 'experience', 'When', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'world', 'championship', 'competitions', 'goal', 'just', 'see', 'high', 'can', 'ride', 'board', 'action', 'rather', 'mundane', 'when', 'boys', 'are', 'swimming', 'pools', 'camera', 'right', 'when', 'film', 'really', 'when', 'have', 'best', 'sense', 'skill', 'joy', 'skateboarding', 'time', 'Hardwicke', 'montages', 'boys', 'skating', 'entire', 'world', 'perfect', 'sense.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'big', 'plus', 'are', 'two', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'first', 'director', 'three', 'young', 'actors', 'second', 'Peralta', 'Tony', 'Alva', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'preference', 'later', 'original', 'Z-Boys', 'talk', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'screenwriter', 'Peralta', 'also', 'changes', 'Hardwicke', 'wanted', 'make', 'making', 'Tony', 'sister', 'Stacy', 'girlfriend', 'Z-Boys', 'pass', 'judgments', 'Robinson', 'Hirsch', 'Rasuk', 'did', 'lot', 'own', 'stunts', 'took', 'share', 'spills', 'worse', 'have', 'own', 'war', 'stories', 'tell', 'making', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'replaying', 'movie', 'segments', 'could', 'do', 'first', 'one', 'commentary', 'track', 'then', 'other', 'rather', 'just', 'doing', 'one', 'then', 'other', 'Making', ""'Lords"", 'Dogtown', 'featurette', 'fits', 'well', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'then', 'have', 'whole', 'bunch', 'other', 'extras', 'including', 'Dogged', 'Dogtown', 'accidents', 'set', 'look', 'cameos', 'film', 'bunch', 'profane', 'outtakes', 'great', 'bit', 'self-taught', 'skateboarding', 'bulldog', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'highlight', 'DVD', 'So', 'even', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'done', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'are', 'couple', 'hours', 'goodies', 'enjoy', 'so', 'even', 'are', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'impressed', 'DVD']",N/A

She also knows how to present teenagers on screen without making them look like aliens: she actually gives them thoughts other than sex and drugs (which, to be sure is in abundance here) and is empathetic to their dreams and desires. She was the logical and best choice to film Stacy Perralta's ""Lords of Dogtown,"" based on the documentary that was released last year about the beginning of the skateboard phenomenon in Southern California circa 1972.As befitting the subject matter, ""LOD"" is filmed with lots of noise, vibrant colors and showcases the beauty as well as the dingy-ness that is emblematic of SoCal beach cities, specifically Venice and Santa Monica. The editing is fast, the pace furious but Hardwicke knows when to quiet things down and let the main characters speak their minds: John Robinson's Stacy, Emile Hirsch's Jay, Victor Rasuk's Tony and Michael Angarano's Sid...all excellent and decidedly democratic about sharing the screen with each other.Then there is Heath Ledger's performance as Skip: wearing a buck-tooth appliance, swigging from a  pint of something-or-other, smoking da kind...he's like a cross between Val Kilmer's performance as Jim Morrison and his own performance as Ned Kelly. It has to be seen to be believed. Is it over-acting? Yes. Is it foolish and silly? Yes. Is it effective?

927673,A2ZX5079G6KROH,B000ALM4AI,"Mike J. Rice ""'Mike Rice, Cultural Historian""","[2, 3]","Lords is a high energy film that drags the audience speeding along with it, tracing the early history of skateboarding in Venice, California.We follow the fortunes of four roughly 15 to 17 year old boys and some of their girlfriends along with an alcoholic skateboard entrepreneur named Skip.The Lords start their day by boarding off the roofs of the run-down rentals of their parents, in Venice. They hook a ride on a city transit bus until the driver spots them in the rear view and starts fish-tailing to shake them off.Which turns out to be no problem. Our heroes drop off the bus jag, and segue into a line of stalled traffic, weaving in and out of the car line-up at high speed, by turns, dazzling and angering assorted drivers. Later, the most daring of the Four performs the crazy trick of boarding right thru a red light at a dangerous intersection without being hit.Skip badgers and cajoles the kids constantly. He exploits them to promote the skateboards he is manufacturing at his Zephyr surfing gear and skateboard store. We are at the dawn of the Skateboard craze and Skip is bent on becoming a millionaire early. Only, he drinks quite a bit and shows signs of being a burnt-out 35 year old hippie.That is the MO of one of the kid's Moms too, played by Rebecca De Mornay, who is so gone she uses expressions like ""far out"" and ""man"" and ""can you dig it?"" Even her kids treat her like a whacked out hippie. There is a heavy subtext of abused kids with parents who've failed to grow up.At one point, De Mornay's current ""old man"" is moving out, and asks her reluctant son to help him, cautioning him to put a blanket over an enormous clear garbage bag of marijuana before carrying it to his car, and offering his surf board as a guilty pay-off for abandoning him, a scene both appalling and amusing to the audience.Skip keeps running his hand-to-mouth manufacturing enterprise, employing other whacked hippies like himself, only working when they need enough jack to make a connection. Its hard to keep a production schedule when your 'groovy' friends refuse to show up for work. I've just realized, looking at the cast on IMDb, that the cool but whacked Skip is Australian Heartthrob Heath Ledger. This part is so good and Ledger so good in it, he deserves an Oscar. I didn't recognize him in his granny seventies blonde long hair. Its his best work on screen.The Lords are perplexed and demoralized by the growing showbiz that is starting to overtake boarding. They gradually have given up on Skip, and begun to quarrel. But before falling completely apart, they define a new stunt that quickly makes them the crowned heads of sidewalk surfing.Los Angeles Area pool-owners are ordered to drain their pools. The Lords decide to practice new stunts in empty pools, stealing into backyards the instant the owners go to work. The audience watches as the surfers perform outrageous tricks in the pools. An article appears in Skateboarding, another in People. Suddenly our boys are stars!Only not all of them like it. An evil presence has intruded into their idyllic childhoods. One of the Lords steals a girl from a more waspish Lord, who looks like he is one of the Hansens singing group. There's a lot of long blond summer surfing hair on these guys. Only one of them has dark hair. One Lord refuses to accept any of the offers. He turns skinhead and starts hanging out with a gang. The Waspish one gets an endorsement deal and starts touring for a board company. Another of the Lords wants all the marbles, and signs with a Hollywood type who travels with an entourage of hangers-on and cheap bimbos in a longish limousine.The hapless Skip has lost his guys and his business. We see him hand crafting a surfboard in the back of someone Else's surfing store. A clerk from the retail side comes in and asks if he'll have a customer's board ready by the next day. Skip says yeah, sure. When they leave, Skip relaxes, lights a cig, reaches for his hidden bottle, turns on the radio, acts out a lip-synched Maggie Mae that would put Rod Stewart out of business, then quietly returns to work. The whole 45 second turn is the best thing in the movie.The wonderful ease of the Lords and the culture they created is spoiled by Success. The Lords stop seeing one another until the dark-haired kid develops a brain tumor and the others, finding success is not what its cracked up to be, gather at his father's dry pool for a rendezvous. An American Graffitti-style Epilogue tells us who the Lords become when they finally grow up.When the lights go up I'm surprised to find two pairs of girls the only audience viewing the film with me. Voila!, why didn't I see it? This is a chick flick, even a skin movie for girls, since there is quite a bit of bared male surface in it. In the lobby, I notice two of the girls are dressed totally in black, wearing the wool knit hats cool black guys now affect year around, and sporting chains that run from the belt loops of black pants to enormous truckers wallets in their back pockets.Lords reminds me a little of the stylish Fast and the Furious of a few years ago, but its ten times better.

927682,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000ALM4AI,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 2]","The Z-Boys were a group of Venice Beach teenagers who, in the 1970's, pioneered a whole new style of skateboarding that is still popular today and which earned the boys status as instant international celebrities (at least within the tightly circumscribed world of skating).  In 2001, one of the original members of the group, Steve Peralta, wrote and directed a documentary on the boys entitled ""Dogtown and Z-Boys,"" which featured interviews with many of the original members of the group.  Then, in 2005, a ""fictionalized"" version of the story came along, ""Lords of Dogtown,"" also written by Peralta, but this time directed by Catherine Hardwicke.It's understandable that in her approach to the material Hardwicke would want to preserve as much as possible the roughhewn, documentary flavor of the original.  Thus, virtually the entire movie has been shot on grainy film stock using a handheld camera, which creates a sense of immediacy and spontaneity, and nicely approximates the look of the time period in which the story is set.  The best scenes involve the boys performing harrowing, death-defying stunts, as they glide through and around pedestrians and vehicles along the traffic-clogged streets of their Southern California neighborhood.  However, this impressionistic style also means that the narrative is often diffuse and unfocused, making it hard for us to distinguish one character from another and to know just who we should be concentrating on at any given moment.  The ostensible protagonist seems to be Peralta himself, although it is roughly 45 minutes into the film's running time before even that simple fact becomes apparent.  However, about halfway through the film, the dramatic elements finally begin to come together, we get to know some of the boys as individuals, and the movie ends on a genuinely touching note.In the rare moments when the camera actually manages to settle down and an individual scene is allowed to play itself out, we begin to sense that some of the boys playing the skaters may actually have some real talent as actors (we can certainly see that they are damn fine skaters), and a few of them I suspect we will be hearing from again in the not too distant future.  In a non-skating role, Heath Ledger plays a sort of mentor to the boys and the owner of the surf shop which served as the launching pad for the movement.  Unfortunately, with his half-hearted attempt at mastering a slacker/stoner persona and accent, Ledger seems to be merely marking time in this film, counting down to that moment when he would stun the world with his soul-shattering performance in ""Brokeback Mountain.""  Who could have foretold from his work here that he had THAT up his sleeve?""Lords of Dogtown"" is moderately informative to those who know next to nothing about the history of skateboarding, but I imagine it is the true aficionado of the sport who will get the most enjoyment out of the movie",3,"strong on style, weak on drama",1152230400,"07 7, 2006",2006,2931,"['Z-Boys', 'were', 'group', 'Venice', 'Beach', 'teenagers', 'who', '1970', 'pioneered', 'whole', 'new', 'style', 'skateboarding', 'still', 'popular', 'today', 'earned', 'boys', 'status', 'instant', 'international', 'celebrities', 'least', 'tightly', 'circumscribed', 'world', 'skating', '2001', 'one', 'original', 'members', 'group', 'Steve', 'Peralta', 'wrote', 'directed', 'documentary', 'boys', 'entitled', 'Dogtown', 'Z-Boys', 'featured', 'interviews', 'many', 'original', 'members', 'group', 'Then', '2005', 'fictionalized', 'version', 'story', 'came', 'along', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'also', 'written', 'Peralta', 'time', 'directed', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke.It', 'understandable', 'approach', 'material', 'Hardwicke', 'would', 'want', 'preserve', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'roughhewn', 'documentary', 'flavor', 'original', 'Thus', 'virtually', 'entire', 'movie', 'been', 'shot', 'grainy', 'film', 'stock', 'using', 'handheld', 'camera', 'sense', 'immediacy', 'spontaneity', 'nicely', 'look', 'time', 'period', 'story', 'set', 'best', 'scenes', 'involve', 'boys', 'performing', 'harrowing', 'death-defying', 'stunts', 'glide', 'pedestrians', 'vehicles', 'traffic-clogged', 'streets', 'Southern', 'California', 'neighborhood', 'However', 'impressionistic', 'style', 'also', 'narrative', 'often', 'diffuse', 'unfocused', 'making', 'hard', 'distinguish', 'one', 'character', 'know', 'just', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'concentrating', 'given', 'moment', 'ostensible', 'protagonist', 'be', 'Peralta', 'roughly', '45', 'minutes', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'even', 'simple', 'fact', 'apparent', 'However', 'halfway', 'film', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'finally', 'begin', 'come', 'together', 'get', 'know', 'boys', 'individuals', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'rare', 'moments', 'when', 'camera', 'actually', 'settle', 'down', 'individual', 'scene', 'allowed', 'play', 'out', 'begin', 'sense', 'boys', 'playing', 'skaters', 'may', 'actually', 'have', 'real', 'talent', 'actors', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'are', 'damn', 'fine', 'skaters', 'few', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'hearing', 'again', 'not', 'too', 'distant', 'future', 'non-skating', 'role', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'sort', 'mentor', 'boys', 'owner', 'surf', 'shop', 'served', 'launching', 'pad', 'movement', 'Unfortunately', 'half-hearted', 'attempt', 'mastering', 'slacker/stoner', 'persona', 'accent', 'Ledger', 'be', 'merely', 'marking', 'time', 'film', 'counting', 'down', 'moment', 'when', 'would', 'stun', 'world', 'soul-shattering', 'performance', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Who', 'could', 'have', 'foretold', 'work', 'here', 'had', 'THAT', 'up', 'sleeve', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'moderately', 'informative', 'who', 'know', 'next', 'nothing', 'history', 'skateboarding', 'imagine', 'true', 'aficionado', 'sport', 'who', 'will', 'get', 'most', 'enjoyment', 'movie']",N/A
927683,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000ALM4AI,Samuel McKewon,"[7, 8]","When I was nine the neighbors behind us built a half-pipe under the maple tree in their backyard, an ugly, wooden ark that bore hours and hours (and hours) of skateboard traffic in the summer. Most nights the low grumbling of wheels, interrupted by the occasional crash of bodies, kept me up after midnight. Just those two noises - you couldn't hear voices in the dark over that monotonous grumble. That fall we moved, and I slept.""Lords of Dogtown"" is about the boys who started the skateboard movement in Venice, Calfornia in the late 1970s, a movement that has morphed into an entire culture with its own Olympics (The X-Games), royalty (Tony Hawk) and pop ingenue (Avril Lavigne). Whatever else you want to say about the sport - I find it repetitive and arbitrary, like most ""judged"" competitions - the movie makes us understand these pioneering boys were counterculture athletes, with an unorthodox coach from a surf shop who nevertheless understood a little about motivation and button-pushing.The trio best known in the skating world is Jay Adams, Tony Alva and Stacy Peralta, the last of whom made a documentary about the subject a few years ago, and writes the screenplay here. The strength of Peralta's script, and Catherine Hardwicke's direction is that it creates three distinct personas, each with their own charms and faults, although we connect best with best with the troubled Jay, maybe because Emile Hirsch is a better actor than John Robinson and Victor Rasuk, who play Stacy and Tony, maybe because Jay seems the biggest risk-taker of the bunch, both in life and on the skateboard.Heath Ledger plays the coach, Skip, as if he asked himself how Val Kilmer would tackle the role. He's funny, though - a burned-out jerk, but loyal. Vince Lombardi called his troops ""son."" Skip calls his ""Z-Boys"" - named after his Zephyr surf shop - ""bro.""The movie takes on a familiar pattern of most sports movies:  The beginning spark, the rise, the interlude where jealousy, cash and women get in the way, the fallout, and the bittersweet conclusion. Hardwicke uses a few camera tricks - one involves mounting the camera behind the back left wheel of the board as it's being ridden, to give us some idea of the skill involved. But ""Lords of Dogtown"" doesn't overload us with technicalities. It focuses more on the personalities.Stacy's the sweet, pretty one, the long blond hair flowing with his calculated, aesthetically pleasing moves. Tony's the speed demon with ambition and charisma. Jay's the maverick most willing to take flight.  By now we know the story of these skaters using pools drained during the drought as the original half-pipes, how many young skaters got rich quick with world tours and sponsors, how drugs were basically around for the taking.Peralta and Hardwicke don't dwell too long on that last point, and just as well, for""Lords of Dogtown"" is as much a celebration of the culture and sport as it is an examination of its roots. The movie loses some of its energy once the team disbands and Skip's surf shop begins to fail, and it might have been more interesting had it touched upon Stacy's later discovery of Hawk, who isn't the founder, but is the godfather. But there is a grungy beauty to the movie, especially in the way Hardwicke uses shots at dawn and dusk to punctuate that it's California, at the ocean, in the 70s, and there are far worse ways to go through life.3 1/2 stars",3,A fun sports movie about skateboard pioneers,1119312000,"06 21, 2005",2005,3414,"['When', 'was', 'nine', 'neighbors', 'built', 'half-pipe', 'maple', 'tree', 'backyard', 'ugly', 'wooden', 'ark', 'bore', 'hours', 'hours', 'hours', 'skateboard', 'traffic', 'summer', 'Most', 'nights', 'low', 'grumbling', 'wheels', 'interrupted', 'occasional', 'crash', 'bodies', 'kept', 'up', 'midnight', 'Just', 'two', 'noises', 'could', ""n't"", 'hear', 'voices', 'dark', 'monotonous', 'grumble', 'fall', 'moved', 'slept', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'boys', 'who', 'started', 'skateboard', 'movement', 'Venice', 'Calfornia', 'late', '1970s', 'movement', 'morphed', 'entire', 'culture', 'own', 'Olympics', 'X-Games', 'royalty', 'Tony', 'Hawk', 'pop', 'ingenue', 'Avril', 'Lavigne', 'else', 'want', 'say', 'sport', 'find', 'repetitive', 'arbitrary', 'most', 'judged', 'competitions', 'movie', 'understand', 'pioneering', 'boys', 'were', 'counterculture', 'athletes', 'unorthodox', 'coach', 'surf', 'shop', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'understood', 'little', 'motivation', 'button-pushing.The', 'trio', 'best', 'known', 'skating', 'world', 'Jay', 'Adams', 'Tony', 'Alva', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', 'last', 'whom', 'made', 'documentary', 'subject', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'screenplay', 'here', 'strength', 'Peralta', 'script', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'direction', 'three', 'distinct', 'personas', 'own', 'charms', 'faults', 'connect', 'best', 'best', 'troubled', 'Jay', 'maybe', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'better', 'actor', 'John', 'Robinson', 'Victor', 'Rasuk', 'who', 'play', 'Stacy', 'Tony', 'maybe', 'Jay', 'biggest', 'risk-taker', 'bunch', 'life', 'skateboard.Heath', 'Ledger', 'coach', 'Skip', 'asked', 'how', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'would', 'tackle', 'role', 'funny', 'burned-out', 'jerk', 'loyal', 'Vince', 'Lombardi', 'called', 'troops', 'son', 'Skip', 'Z-Boys', 'named', 'Zephyr', 'surf', 'shop', 'bro', 'movie', 'familiar', 'pattern', 'most', 'sports', 'movies', 'beginning', 'spark', 'rise', 'interlude', 'where', 'jealousy', 'cash', 'women', 'get', 'way', 'fallout', 'bittersweet', 'conclusion', 'Hardwicke', 'few', 'camera', 'one', 'mounting', 'camera', 'back', 'left', 'wheel', 'board', 'being', 'ridden', 'give', 'idea', 'skill', 'involved', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', ""n't"", 'overload', 'technicalities', 'more', 'personalities.Stacy', 'sweet', 'pretty', 'one', 'long', 'blond', 'hair', 'flowing', 'calculated', 'aesthetically', 'pleasing', 'moves', 'Tony', 'speed', 'demon', 'ambition', 'charisma', 'Jay', 'maverick', 'most', 'willing', 'take', 'flight', 'now', 'know', 'story', 'skaters', 'using', 'pools', 'drained', 'drought', 'original', 'half-pipes', 'how', 'many', 'young', 'skaters', 'got', 'rich', 'quick', 'world', 'tours', 'sponsors', 'how', 'drugs', 'were', 'basically', 'taking.Peralta', 'Hardwicke', 'do', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'too', 'long', 'last', 'point', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'as', 'much', 'celebration', 'culture', 'sport', 'examination', 'roots', 'movie', 'energy', 'team', 'disbands', 'Skip', 'surf', 'shop', 'fail', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'had', 'touched', 'Stacy', 'later', 'discovery', 'Hawk', 'who', ""n't"", 'founder', 'godfather', 'grungy', 'beauty', 'movie', 'especially', 'way', 'Hardwicke', 'shots', 'dawn', 'dusk', 'punctuate', 'California', 'ocean', '70s', 'are', 'far', 'worse', 'ways', 'go', 'life.3', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A

I went down a steep hill, hit a pebble, flew off the board and landed on my head.  I spent the next three days in the hospital with a concussion.  The only person who visited was my mother.  I decided skating wasn't my thing.I still liked my skater friends, though, and enjoyed their company, so I tried making skating videos. My first one was of an angry old man in a Cadillac running over a street full of skaters a la ""Death Race 2000.""  My friends were annoyed, said it wasn't how these videos were supposed to be, and showed me what they wanted.  I never could get it right, and they eventually quit returning my calls.I still miss my friends, and when I want to see them again, I resort to watching their doubles in films like ""Lords of Dogtown.""""Lords of Dogtown"" is a good film -- hardly the ""Endless Summer"" of skateboarding films, but it's got good performances and some decent skating scenes.

I'd say if you're really interested in the sport, watch the documentary ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" first.I suppose if I'd been a skateboarder, I'd probably appreciate ""Lords of Dogtown"" more; even though the film goes into detail about the skaters' personal history and relationships, the scene's insularity still feels preserved, which makes the film far less engaging, even cold.

927686,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000ALM4AI,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[10, 32]","The many times I watched the trailer for ""The Lords of Dogtown"", I cringed at the sight of Heath Ledger. The images of him as a drugged out former hippy recruiting a bunch of kids to ride skateboards caused me to start grinding my teeth. The images hinted at one over the top performance, and not in a good way.""The Lords of Dogtown"" is a fictionalized retelling of the same material covered in a documentary released last year called ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"". The documentary was written and produced by Stacy Peralta, one of the ""Z-Boys"", a group of young kids who rode skateboards for Zephyr and created the whole skateboard craze. Zephyr was sponsored by Skip Englom, a local surf shop owner in Venice who realized that this could be the next big thing. The success of the documentary prompted Peralta to write the screenplay for ""Lords of Dogtown"" and the film was made with Catherine Hardwicke (""thirteen"") at the helm.Skip Englom (Heath Ledger) and his surf shop employees rule the area under the old Venice pier. Stacy (John Robinson, ""Elephant""), Jay (Emile Hirsch, ""Imaginary Heroes"") and Tony (Victor Rasuk, ""Raising Victor Vargas"") are the next generation and they want to get out there and surf as well. One day, someone shows Skip the new thing in skateboard wheels (neoprene, ""made from oil"") and his mind starts clicking. He has everyone practice and soon everyone is a member of the Zephyr team. Everyone except for Stacy. Stacy has a job and can't attend all of the practice sessions. During the first competition, Stacy enters as an independent and proves to Skip that he should be a member of the team. As the skaters become more and more well-known, fame threatens to rip the friends and the team apart.Well, Heath Ledger's performance is way over the top. But in the context of the film's story, it is more acceptable. I didn't say it was believable, because it isn't, just more acceptable. I didn't feel like someone was scratching their fingernails across a blackboard, as I expected. Ledger plays Skip Englom and seems to be channeling the spirit of Jim Morrison as played by Val Kilmer. Drunk or high in every scene, he rants and raves or plays a drugged out hippie. I know the character is based on a real person, but because the film is fictionalized, perhaps it could have been toned down a little. What the performance lacks is any connection to the story. At one point, Skip has a fight with his employees because they aren't building skateboards fast enough. Why? Before, he seemed blissfully unaware of the need to make money. Now he wants as much as he can get. The transition isn't there.This same lack of connecting the dots is a weakness throughout the film. Late in the film, Jay and Tony seem to resent Stacy's success. Stacy comments that he was the last one to leave the team. Based on the story, he was, so why are they resentful? Why is Tony Alva resentful of Stacy Peralta? The film portrays Tony Alva as a much bigger celebrity, why would he be resentful? At one point, Stacy's girlfriend is Kathy (Nikki Reed, ""thirteen""), Tony's sister. When Stacy declines to join a party, she immediately hooks up with Jay. Don't get it or understand why she would do this.Jay, as played by Emile Hirsch, is a complicated character, and perhaps the most interesting and inconsistent of the group. As a skateboarder, he seems fearless and a bit crazed, always running around with his tongue hanging out and his eyes wild. He is a kid out of control. These scenes, on their own, would be hard to watch and believe, yet they are balanced by a couple of scenes depicting his family life. The first time we see him, he is sneaking into his mother's bedroom to borrow her boyfriend's surfboard. The boyfriend wakes up yelling and then realizes it is Jay. They both encourage him to take it. Jay's mom, Philaine, played by Rebecca De Mornay, is very convincing as a woman living in a fog of drugs and alcohol. She loves her kid and he loves her. But his life at home is screwed up. Towards the end of the film, there is a shift in Jay's character which I didn't believe. It may have actually happened in real life, but as depicted in the film, it isn't convincing.There are a lot of scenes of the four main characters skateboarding around and watching each other in awe. These scenes have a sort of visual grace to them but there are way too many of them. How many times can we watch people skateboard in loopy circles up a ramp?""Dogtown"" needed fewer scenes of skateboarding and more scenes exploring the relationships between the characters. Hardwicke showed such a knack for this in her debut film ""thirteen"" I was disappointed she didn't continue the tradition in this film.",2,Someone Needed to Connect The Thoughts,1118016000,"06 6, 2005",2005,4699,"['many', 'times', 'watched', 'trailer', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'cringed', 'sight', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'images', 'drugged', 'out', 'former', 'hippy', 'recruiting', 'bunch', 'kids', 'ride', 'skateboards', 'caused', 'start', 'grinding', 'teeth', 'images', 'hinted', 'one', 'top', 'performance', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'fictionalized', 'retelling', 'same', 'material', 'covered', 'documentary', 'released', 'last', 'year', 'called', 'Dogtown', 'Z-Boys', 'documentary', 'was', 'written', 'produced', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', 'one', 'Z-Boys', 'group', 'young', 'kids', 'who', 'rode', 'skateboards', 'Zephyr', 'created', 'whole', 'skateboard', 'craze', 'Zephyr', 'was', 'sponsored', 'Skip', 'Englom', 'local', 'surf', 'shop', 'owner', 'Venice', 'who', 'realized', 'could', 'be', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'success', 'documentary', 'prompted', 'Peralta', 'write', 'screenplay', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'thirteen', 'helm.Skip', 'Englom', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'surf', 'shop', 'employees', 'rule', 'area', 'old', 'Venice', 'pier', 'Stacy', 'John', 'Robinson', 'Elephant', 'Jay', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'Tony', 'Victor', 'Rasuk', 'Raising', 'Victor', 'Vargas', 'are', 'next', 'generation', 'want', 'get', 'there', 'surf', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'day', 'someone', 'shows', 'Skip', 'new', 'thing', 'skateboard', 'wheels', 'neoprene', 'made', 'oil', 'mind', 'clicking', 'everyone', 'practice', 'soon', 'everyone', 'member', 'Zephyr', 'team', 'Everyone', 'Stacy', 'Stacy', 'job', 'ca', ""n't"", 'attend', 'practice', 'sessions', 'first', 'competition', 'Stacy', 'independent', 'Skip', 'should', 'be', 'member', 'team', 'skaters', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'well-known', 'fame', 'rip', 'friends', 'team', 'apart.Well', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'performance', 'way', 'top', 'context', 'film', 'story', 'more', 'acceptable', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'believable', ""n't"", 'just', 'more', 'acceptable', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'someone', 'was', 'scratching', 'fingernails', 'blackboard', 'expected', 'Ledger', 'Skip', 'Englom', 'be', 'channeling', 'spirit', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'played', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Drunk', 'high', 'scene', 'drugged', 'out', 'hippie', 'know', 'character', 'based', 'real', 'person', 'film', 'fictionalized', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'little', 'What', 'performance', 'connection', 'story', 'one', 'point', 'Skip', 'fight', 'employees', 'are', ""n't"", 'building', 'skateboards', 'fast', 'enough', 'Why', 'seemed', 'blissfully', 'unaware', 'need', 'make', 'money', 'Now', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'get', 'transition', ""n't"", 'there.This', 'same', 'lack', 'connecting', 'dots', 'weakness', 'film', 'Late', 'film', 'Jay', 'Tony', 'seem', 'resent', 'Stacy', 'success', 'Stacy', 'comments', 'was', 'last', 'one', 'leave', 'team', 'Based', 'story', 'was', 'why', 'are', 'resentful', 'Why', 'Tony', 'Alva', 'resentful', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', 'film', 'Tony', 'Alva', 'much', 'bigger', 'celebrity', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'resentful', 'one', 'point', 'Stacy', 'girlfriend', 'Kathy', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'thirteen', 'Tony', 'sister', 'When', 'Stacy', 'join', 'party', 'immediately', 'up', 'Jay', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'understand', 'why', 'would', 'do', 'this.Jay', 'played', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'complicated', 'character', 'perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'inconsistent', 'group', 'skateboarder', 'fearless', 'bit', 'crazed', 'always', 'running', 'around', 'tongue', 'hanging', 'out', 'eyes', 'wild', 'kid', 'control', 'scenes', 'own', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'watch', 'believe', 'yet', 'are', 'balanced', 'couple', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'family', 'life', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'sneaking', 'mother', 'bedroom', 'borrow', 'boyfriend', 'surfboard', 'boyfriend', 'up', 'yelling', 'then', 'realizes', 'Jay', 'encourage', 'take', 'Jay', 'mom', 'Philaine', 'played', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'very', 'convincing', 'woman', 'living', 'fog', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'kid', 'life', 'home', 'screwed', 'up', 'end', 'film', 'shift', 'Jay', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'may', 'have', 'actually', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'depicted', 'film', ""n't"", 'are', 'lot', 'scenes', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'skateboarding', 'around', 'watching', 'other', 'awe', 'scenes', 'have', 'sort', 'visual', 'grace', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'watch', 'people', 'skateboard', 'loopy', 'circles', 'up', 'ramp', 'Dogtown', 'needed', 'fewer', 'scenes', 'skateboarding', 'more', 'scenes', 'exploring', 'relationships', 'characters', 'Hardwicke', 'showed', 'knack', 'debut', 'film', 'thirteen', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'continue', 'tradition', 'film']",N/A

The story is terrific, written by one of the actual Z-Boys, but the way it was filmed was problematic. The beginning of the film is very choppy and confusing, honestly it's difficult to know who is who and what's going on until about the half way point of the film. The Z-Boys are the basis and stars of the film, but it's Heath Ledger who steals the show. He really had a gift for picking up on every mannerism and movement a person makes.

927688,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000ALM4AI,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","I give only three stars to `Lords of Dogtown' not because I didn't like the film. I did like it, but as you all know, the same story is covered by the superb documentary `Dogtown and the Z-Boys' which I liked better. So why did they make another film about the Z-Boys?Those who have seen the documentary about the Z-Boys already know the story, which focuses on the three characters in this film - Tony, Jay, and Stacy. That means, Tony Alva, Jay Adams, and Stacy Peralta, and Peralta provided the script for the film. The boys are to form the basis of skateboarding team Z-Boys, whose gravity-defying style influenced the modern skateboarding as extreme sports, and they became cultural icons.The stories about the boys who practiced the techniques in the empty swimming pools (and to do so, they sneaked into the houses) are now a legend, and you can see how they did it in `Lords of Dogtown' with the professional actors Victor Razuk as Tony, Emile Hirsch as Jay, and John Robinson as Stacy, and I think all of them did a very good job. The skateboarding scenes are all exciting, and the camera sometimes invites you to share the POV of the skateboarder. When they fell off the skateboard, you feel the pain too.But there is a big flaw among the otherwise perfect story, and that is the dramatic element of it. The boys' `rags to the riches' story does not have the impact of the images, with too episodic narrative and ineffective presentations of the principal characters' personalities. Success is expensive and fleeting for them, we are told, but the price they paid is not explained enough. We know they suffered thanks to the good acting, but the suffering comes too sudden without the building-up process of it. In short, their skateboarding is radical, but the drama part of the film lacks the radical power of their style.And some viewers might object to some part of the film. Female characters are not given substantial roles except Jay's mother played by Rebecca De Mornay, and though Nikki Reed (`Thirteen') appears, her role as Stacy's girlfriend is so small. And the owner of the surfboard shop and the boys' unofficial protector Skip (Heath Ledger with a long hair and beard) appears, but Skip looks always as if under influence of substance, but Ledger is, I think, did it too much. Was the real `Skip' so ... eccentric? Maybe so, and you can check it out in the `Z-Boys' documentary.To her credit, Catherine Hardwick (`Thirteen') did a perfect job in evoking the times of the 70s, with good soundtrack music. Hardwick's keen eye for detail, which served her very well when she was an able production designer, didn't fail her, and the film manages to bring onto the screen the hot air of West Coast you felt in `Dogtown and the Z-Boys.' Skateboarders might find some things strange - and I cannot skateboard - but overall everything looks convincing to me. But it still must be said that more convincing is the documentary, made by the same Stacy Peralta, the protagonist of `Lords of Dogtown.'",3,"(3.5 STARS) Re-create the Flavor of the Time, But Not Enough Drama In It",1134777600,"12 17, 2005",2005,3015,"['give', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'did', 'know', 'same', 'story', 'covered', 'superb', 'documentary', 'Dogtown', 'Z-Boys', 'liked', 'better', 'So', 'why', 'did', 'make', 'film', 'Z-Boys', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'documentary', 'Z-Boys', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'three', 'characters', 'film', 'Tony', 'Jay', 'Stacy', 'Tony', 'Alva', 'Jay', 'Adams', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', 'Peralta', 'provided', 'script', 'film', 'boys', 'are', 'form', 'basis', 'skateboarding', 'team', 'Z-Boys', 'gravity-defying', 'style', 'influenced', 'modern', 'skateboarding', 'extreme', 'sports', 'became', 'cultural', 'icons.The', 'stories', 'boys', 'who', 'practiced', 'techniques', 'empty', 'swimming', 'pools', 'do', 'so', 'sneaked', 'houses', 'are', 'now', 'legend', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'did', 'Lords', 'Dogtown', 'professional', 'actors', 'Victor', 'Razuk', 'Tony', 'Emile', 'Hirsch', 'Jay', 'John', 'Robinson', 'Stacy', 'think', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'skateboarding', 'scenes', 'are', 'exciting', 'camera', 'sometimes', 'share', 'POV', 'skateboarder', 'When', 'fell', 'off', 'skateboard', 'feel', 'pain', 'too.But', 'big', 'flaw', 'otherwise', 'perfect', 'story', 'dramatic', 'element', 'boys', 'rags', 'riches', 'story', 'not', 'have', 'impact', 'images', 'too', 'episodic', 'narrative', 'ineffective', 'presentations', 'principal', 'characters', 'personalities', 'Success', 'expensive', 'fleeting', 'are', 'told', 'price', 'paid', 'not', 'explained', 'enough', 'know', 'suffered', 'thanks', 'good', 'acting', 'suffering', 'too', 'sudden', 'building-up', 'process', 'short', 'skateboarding', 'radical', 'drama', 'part', 'film', 'radical', 'power', 'style.And', 'viewers', 'might', 'object', 'part', 'film', 'Female', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'substantial', 'roles', 'Jay', 'mother', 'played', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'Thirteen', 'role', 'Stacy', 'girlfriend', 'so', 'small', 'owner', 'surfboard', 'shop', 'boys', 'unofficial', 'protector', 'Skip', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'long', 'hair', 'beard', 'Skip', 'always', 'influence', 'substance', 'Ledger', 'think', 'did', 'too', 'much', 'real', 'Skip', 'so', 'eccentric', 'Maybe', 'so', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'Z-Boys', 'credit', 'Catherine', 'Hardwick', 'Thirteen', 'did', 'perfect', 'job', 'evoking', 'times', '70s', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'Hardwick', 'keen', 'eye', 'detail', 'served', 'very', 'well', 'when', 'was', 'able', 'production', 'designer', 'did', ""n't"", 'fail', 'film', 'manages', 'bring', 'screen', 'hot', 'air', 'West', 'Coast', 'felt', 'Dogtown', 'Z-Boys', 'Skateboarders', 'might', 'find', 'things', 'strange', 'can', 'not', 'skateboard', 'overall', 'everything', 'convincing', 'still', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'more', 'convincing', 'documentary', 'made', 'same', 'Stacy', 'Peralta', 'protagonist', 'Lords', 'Dogtown']",N/A
