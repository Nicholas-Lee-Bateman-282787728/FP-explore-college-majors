1695650,A3DN9249F3X716,B00J5LXMTG,Corey Lidster,"[3, 5]","As a long-time fan of Alejandro Jodorowsky's insane and convoluted Bande Dessinee, his conceptual lunacy brought to life by the most impressive array of artists in the history of the medium, this film tells the story behind the stories.His classic film 'El Topo', like a collaboration between Sergio Leone, Sam Peckinpah,and David Lynch (ironically...), was something completely new, a beautiful, horrific anomaly that is widely credited with starting the 'Midnight Movie' phenomenon of the 70's. Never lacking ambition, Jodo set his sights on adapting Frank Herbert's novel 'Dune', a sprawling science fiction epic that would require a massive budget to bring to the screen.This fascinating film recounts Jodorowsky's mission to make 'Dune', using his persuasive personality, unshakable self-confidence, and obsessive drive to enlist talents like Orson Welles, Pink Floyd, Salvador Dali, Moebius and H.R. Giger. His script presents a fusion of the original novel with his own distinct narrative elements, and the pre-production stage yields thousands of pages of unorthodox ideas and conceptual art, much of it by Jean 'Moebius' Giraud. When the funding breaks down and Jodorowsky is forced to abandon his dream, much of the work find it's way into his comics debut with Moebius, 'The Incal', a work of imaginative power and artistic brilliance that stands as a modern classic. It also launched Jodorowsky's long and prolific career as BD's pre-eminent writer.In a strange and somewhat tragic twist, after Jodorowsky is 'fired' as director of the Dune adaptation, the stated reason being that his work was 'too weird', the producers then hired famously weird auteur David Lynch to take over. In a just whim of fate, 'Dune' will prove to be Lynch's one and only failure, both financially and critically. 'Jodorowsky's Dune', on the other hand, is a fascinating look at one of the world's most interesting creative personalities, and how exciting, satisfying, difficult and painful the process of making a movie can be. Unfortunately, we can only speculate on how amazing his version of 'Dune' might have been, but the work done would influence every other science fiction film of the late 70's and 80's, from 'Star Wars' to 'Alien' (H.R.Giger would go from Dune to his famous conceptual designs for Alien, leasing his dark, other-worldly artistry; Dan O'Bannon would go on to write the film) and 'Blade Runner' (Moebius would take much of his experience on Dune into Blade Runner, providing the visionary art behind the stunning architecture and vehicles). By involving so many talented people, many of whom were new to film, and creating these connections that otherwise would never have been made, Jodorowsky's unrealized vision of Dune changed the course of film and comics. The best documentary of the last few years.",5,'Jodorowsky's too damn weird to direct this movie.

1695652,A2LSWBBCLW87LW,B00J5LXMTG,Devan,"[0, 0]","It's become common knowledge that Alejandro Jodorowsky, one of cinema's most polarizing avant-garde filmmakers, tried to adapt Frank Herbert's novel a decade before David Lynch took the reigns. Even a cursory glance at what Jodorowsky was trying to do at that time, from recruiting Pink Floyd and Magma to provide soundtracks for the heroes and villains (respectively), to casting Orson Welles and Salvadore Dali, could give you the sense that his version of Dune would have been one of the strangest sci-fi movies of all time. Thanks to this documentary, you can now be swept up in a narrative that takes you through what Jodorowsky's Dune could have been. It's not enough to simply read about it; you get to hear from the man himself, look at some of Moebius' shot-for-shot sketches (which are actually spliced together to provide a sense of movement), learn more about how the cast was recruited for their prescribed roles, and question how it could possibly come together the way Jodorowsky wanted it.It's a matter of speculation as to how this movie would have impacted the motion picture landscape of the 70's, but conceptually, it's still way ahead of its time and has indeed influenced countless sci-fi movies that came to life long after this project collapsed. You're taken through the process and you're introduced to Jodorowsky's zany mystique, but it's quite clear that he was so passionate about what he was doing then and is even more passionate about in retrospect. It's a fascinating, charming, and touching documentary about trying to bring something massive and different to the world.

The film is mostly  Mr. Jodorowsky  and a handful of others giving monologues about how Jodorowsky's Dune project was brought to the point where all they needed to make the film was a studio to say yes.  In the process the viewer learns a great deal about Jodorowsky the man.  Mr. Jodorowsky was wanting to keep artistic and creative control of his project and studios wanted a film that would make them money.

1695656,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00J5LXMTG,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","My guess is that most people have never heard of Alejandro Jodorowsky. The acclaimed director broke into notoriety in 1970 with his film EL TOPO, a movie that didn't play the normal film circuit but became one of the first major midnight movies to play across the country. Not sticking to the usual ways movies were made or told, Jodorowsky's fans grew with each film he made. It's surprising that he only directed 9 films total. But the story of what happened after he made his second major success (THE HOLY MOUNTAIN) and started on his next picture may explain that. The name of the movie he was set to make? DUNE.Yes, we all know that the movie version of DUNE was made by David Lynch, but the truth of the matter is that Jodorowsky was set to direct it before that was ever considered. This documentary tells the story of what happened from start to finish, how a French investor told Jodorowsky he would finance his next picture and when asked what he wanted to do was told DUNE. It progresses with how he hired this person or that person to help tell this grand epic. And eventually it tells the story of how corporate studios run by businessmen rather than film lovers never gave him the chance to make his movie.Most of this is pretty well known. Going into this film you already know the beginning and the end. But that's not what makes the film so great or so interesting. What makes it that way is Jodorowsky himself. At 85 years old we're given a glimpse at a man who seems far younger than his years, filled with a zest for life and a love of film that few movie makers have. As he talks about his plans for his version of DUNE, Jodorowsky explains that he felt it was a mission, a spiritual goal that he set for himself and expected those who worked with him on the project to share. Indeed, that commitment he sought prevented several top names in the business from being selected to join him on his crusade.The choices he did make were relatively new to the business at the time and he chose them because he saw something in their art, in the things they had already done, that he thought he could apply to this film. Along with cartoonist/illustrator Moebius he put together an incredibly huge collection of drawings, shot by shot what he intended to put on the screen. Over 3,000 drawings were done, something few had ever done before. He discovered a German artist named H.R. Giger and thought the things he was creating with his art could be applied to this film. He hired Dan O'Bannon to handle the special effects based on the film he and John Carpenter had done, DARK STAR. And with all this talent on hand the film still didn't get made.The people he hired did go on to some spectacular things though. Moebius continued to be a noted illustrator and cartoonist. Giger went on to create the now famous alien from the movie of the same name. And O'Bannon went on to write ALIEN, LIFEFORCE and RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD. Many of the others involved moved forward into blossoming careers as well.All of these tidbits come into play as the movie progresses and Jodorowsky tells the story of how it all went down. In the way he describes things, the passion that he displays while talking about a failed movie production, you wish more and more that he had been allowed to make his film. It truly would have been something unseen before. While many directors these days make movies based solely on the amount of money they'll get paid or with the hope of turning one film into a franchise, Jodorowsky wanted to make art. As he gets exciting in telling his tale you'll find yourself excited as well.While Jodorowsky's DUNE was never made, this may be as close as we'll ever get to seeing that film. Filled with the illustrations that were done, some animated for this film, hearing him discuss his plans and listening to him talk about who he tried to cast in the film makes for great story telling. In the end what I left with after watching this was a desire to see the earlier films he was noted for. They might not end up being anything I will appreciate but at the same time I will know that there was a man filled with passion when it came to the films he created. It's nice to see that on hand these days.",5,WHAT IF...,1405468800,"07 16, 2014",2014,4230,"['guess', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'Alejandro', 'Jodorowsky', 'acclaimed', 'director', 'broke', 'notoriety', '1970', 'film', 'EL', 'TOPO', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'normal', 'film', 'circuit', 'became', 'one', 'first', 'major', 'midnight', 'movies', 'play', 'country', 'Not', 'sticking', 'usual', 'ways', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'told', 'Jodorowsky', 'fans', 'grew', 'film', 'made', 'surprising', 'only', 'directed', '9', 'films', 'total', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'made', 'second', 'major', 'success', 'THE', 'HOLY', 'MOUNTAIN', 'started', 'next', 'picture', 'may', 'explain', 'name', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'make', 'DUNE.Yes', 'know', 'movie', 'version', 'DUNE', 'was', 'made', 'David', 'Lynch', 'truth', 'matter', 'Jodorowsky', 'was', 'set', 'direct', 'was', 'ever', 'considered', 'documentary', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'start', 'finish', 'how', 'French', 'investor', 'told', 'Jodorowsky', 'would', 'finance', 'next', 'picture', 'when', 'asked', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'was', 'told', 'DUNE', 'how', 'hired', 'person', 'person', 'help', 'tell', 'grand', 'epic', 'eventually', 'story', 'how', 'corporate', 'studios', 'run', 'businessmen', 'rather', 'film', 'lovers', 'never', 'gave', 'chance', 'make', 'movie.Most', 'pretty', 'well', 'known', 'Going', 'film', 'already', 'know', 'beginning', 'end', 'not', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'great', 'so', 'interesting', 'What', 'way', 'Jodorowsky', '85', 'years', 'old', ""'re"", 'given', 'glimpse', 'man', 'who', 'far', 'younger', 'years', 'filled', 'zest', 'life', 'love', 'film', 'few', 'movie', 'makers', 'have', 'plans', 'version', 'DUNE', 'Jodorowsky', 'felt', 'was', 'mission', 'spiritual', 'goal', 'set', 'expected', 'who', 'worked', 'project', 'share', 'Indeed', 'commitment', 'sought', 'prevented', 'several', 'top', 'names', 'business', 'being', 'selected', 'join', 'crusade.The', 'choices', 'did', 'make', 'were', 'relatively', 'new', 'business', 'time', 'chose', 'saw', 'something', 'art', 'things', 'had', 'already', 'done', 'thought', 'could', 'apply', 'film', 'cartoonist/illustrator', 'Moebius', 'put', 'together', 'incredibly', 'huge', 'collection', 'drawings', 'shot', 'shot', 'what', 'intended', 'put', 'screen', '3,000', 'drawings', 'were', 'done', 'something', 'few', 'had', 'ever', 'done', 'before', 'discovered', 'German', 'artist', 'named', 'H.R', 'Giger', 'thought', 'things', 'was', 'creating', 'art', 'could', 'be', 'applied', 'film', 'hired', 'Dan', ""O'Bannon"", 'handle', 'special', 'effects', 'based', 'film', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'had', 'done', 'DARK', 'STAR', 'talent', 'hand', 'film', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'made.The', 'people', 'hired', 'did', 'go', 'spectacular', 'things', 'Moebius', 'continued', 'be', 'noted', 'illustrator', 'cartoonist', 'Giger', 'went', 'create', 'now', 'famous', 'alien', 'movie', 'same', 'name', ""O'Bannon"", 'went', 'write', 'ALIEN', 'LIFEFORCE', 'RETURN', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'DEAD', 'Many', 'others', 'involved', 'moved', 'forward', 'blossoming', 'careers', 'well.All', 'tidbits', 'come', 'play', 'movie', 'Jodorowsky', 'story', 'how', 'went', 'down', 'way', 'things', 'passion', 'talking', 'failed', 'movie', 'production', 'wish', 'more', 'more', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'make', 'film', 'truly', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'unseen', 'before', 'many', 'directors', 'days', 'make', 'movies', 'based', 'solely', 'amount', 'money', ""'ll"", 'get', 'paid', 'hope', 'turning', 'one', 'film', 'franchise', 'Jodorowsky', 'wanted', 'make', 'art', 'exciting', 'telling', 'tale', ""'ll"", 'find', 'excited', 'well.While', 'Jodorowsky', 'DUNE', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'may', 'be', 'as', 'close', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'get', 'seeing', 'film', 'Filled', 'illustrations', 'were', 'done', 'animated', 'film', 'hearing', 'discuss', 'plans', 'listening', 'talk', 'who', 'tried', 'cast', 'film', 'great', 'story', 'telling', 'end', 'what', 'left', 'watching', 'was', 'desire', 'see', 'earlier', 'films', 'was', 'noted', 'might', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'anything', 'will', 'appreciate', 'same', 'time', 'will', 'know', 'was', 'man', 'filled', 'passion', 'when', 'came', 'films', 'created', 'nice', 'see', 'hand', 'days']",Jodorowsky's Dune
1695657,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00J5LXMTG,Paul Allaer,"[45, 48]","""Jodorowsky's Dune"" (2013 release from France; 90 min.) brings the background story on what is referred to as possibly the greatest movie never made, the adaptation of the science fiction book ""Dune"" by ""high art"" director Alejandro Jodorowsky. As the documentary opens, we get a quick crash course of Jodorowsky's earlier work, including experimental theater in Mexico in the early 60s and a couple of cult movies (""El Topo"", ""The Holy Mountain"") in the early 70s that did surprisingly well in Europe. So Jodorowsky gets the opportunity from a French producer to assemble a team of ""warriors"", as he calls them, to make his vision of Dune into a visual reality. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, if you are a movie enthusiast, you are in for a finger-lickin' good time, honestly! Credit for that goes of course to director Frank Pavich, but let's be honest: he couldn't have had a more enjoyable subject than Alejandro Jodorowsky, who turns out to be a master story teller. The way he convinces people, one after another, to give their cooperation to the movie, is just priceless (one of the best stories involves the movie makers making a trip to London to ask Pink Floyd to provide the soundtrack--just watch!). Jodorowsky is now in his mid-80s but he looks about 20 or 30 years younger, and most importantly, he remains as feisty and as ambitious as ever. There is a nice soundtrack to the movie, by Kurt Stenzel (of the band SpacEKraft).I had seen the trailer for this movie a number of times in recent weeks, and this was for me once of the most anticipated releases so far in 2014. The movie opened last month at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I went to see it right away. The early evening screening I saw this at was very well attended, I'm happy to say. If you are in the mood for a top notch documentary that gives the spotlight to a creative genius who could've/should've brought Dune to the big screen the right way, by all means see this.

1695658,A1M1GL2X80S7JG,B00J5LXMTG,"Randall F. Miller III ""Randy Miller III""","[7, 8]","This well-received 2013 documentary by Frank Pavich explores the ups and downs of director Alejando Jodorowsky's failed adaptation of Dune in 1975.  It's a fascinating ""What If?"" story that doubles as a look behind-the-scenes and a brief glimpse at what might have been.  Featured participants include Jodorowsky (84 at the time of filming, and as charismatic as ever), artist Chris Foss, artist H.R. Giger and FX supervisor Dan O'Bannon (both later famous for ""Alien""), producers Michel Seydoux and Jean-Paul Gibon, Jodorowsky's son Brontis (who also acted in ""El Topo"") and more.  Fascinating stories are told, great art is shared and we see exactly where everything went off the rails.  You'll hear about the involvement of Mick Jagger, Orson Welles and Salvador Dali, as well as failed studio pitches and, of course, the influence on modern sci-fi.  It's a really well-done documentary from start to finish, no matter if you're familiar with ""Dune"" and Jodorowsky or not.I received an advance screener from Sony for a review published separately at DVD Talk, which you can look up if you're so inclined.  Sony's done a good job on this disc: the A/V presentation is terrific and the bonus features, though limited, are interesting.  They include over 45 minutes' worth of deleted scenes from the film and the original trailer, which brings the total amount of content to just under 2.5 hours.

I would love to have seen what Dune would have turned out to be if his vision would have made it to the screen.  Sadly - a lot of what he envisioned - seems to me anyway - may have been totally unfilmable at the time.

1695660,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,B00J5LXMTG,Robin Simmons,"[3, 4]","Alejandro Jodorowsky is a charismatic 85-year-old Chilean-French idiosyncratic filmmaker.  He's also a writer, graphic novelist, actor, playwright, musician, all around madman and part time guru.  Jodo, as he is known by his many friends and fans, is first and foremost a passionate artist.  He has the soul of a creator who operates with a ferocious vision that remains singular, searing and enigmatic.He's best-known for writing and directing the underground cult hits EL TOPO and THE HOLY MOUNTAIN that are still popular at special midnight showings.In 1975, Jodo began working on his most ambitious project yet: an adaptation of Frank Herbert's futuristic Messianic space opera best-seller ""Dune"" starring his own 12-year-old son Brontis alongside Orson Welles, Mick Jagger, David Carradine and Salvador Dali featuring music by Pink Floyd.  The production art was by some of the best, most provocative talents of the time, including Chris Foss, Dan O'Bannon H.R. Giger and Jean ""Moebius"" Giraud.  With key above and below the line talent in place, Jodo was poised to change cinema forever.  In fact, even though the film was never realized as envisioned by Jodo, it did impact numerous films, including STAR WARS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK,  ALIEN and even the more recent PROMETHEUS.  (Unfortunately, David Lynch's DUNE, a big incoherent flop widely derided was not a result of Jodo's lavish and passionate dedication and design.)Filmed over three years, director Frank Pavich's fabulous documentary on Jodo's ill-fated project is the result of unique and unprecedented access to production material including an extraordinary hard-bound book -- as thick as two big city phone books -- that contained the screenplay, art and meticulous story boards that was used as a ""calling card"" to pitch the movie to main stream studios.  Fascinating interviews including H.R. Giger (artist, ALIEN), Gary Kurtz (producer, STAR WARS) and Nicolas Winding Refn (director, DRIVE) give an unexpected heft and credibility to the material.JODOROWSKY'S DUNE was an official selection at the 2013 Cannes, Telluride, Toronto and AFI film festivals.I was blown away by this incredible documentary that is as wonderfully entertaining as it is inspiring.  It is not only about a failed movie project; it is about what it means to be an unfiltered, fully committed artist.  It is about a single-minded, full-blown passion so intense that it consumes fellow artists, musicians and performers.  It is also about how so-called failure has amazing rewards.Jodorowsky is mesmerizing as he recalls his ambitious venture that does not exist except in the minds of those who created it.  It is not Herbert's ""Dune,"" but a morphed vision that was merely triggered by Herbert and then given a new incarnation by the obsessive, Chilean surrealist.  It's a ""What if"" story written without restraint.  Jodo's stated goal was ""to mutate young minds "" and change the world.  His movie was about the redemption of a planet.  It's not clear why the studios did not want to work with Jodo; the impression I got is that they were afraid of him and his disregard of the film's cost and length.  Jodo has disdain for money to be factor in the creation of true art.I can't recommend the movie highly enough.  Sony Classics.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[11, 11]","All the advertising - as well as most reviews - of the 2013 documentary Jodorowsky's Dune  use the phrase ""The Greatest Film Never Made"" (and I guess I am too, right?). That pretty much sums it up in five words. But the story goes deeper.  As I post this review there are already 10 reviews here but most of them are based on either the theatrical release or the Amazon Instant one. The Bluray has 46 minutes of ""Deleted Scenes"" which add to the 90 minute film as released. (One has to wonder what the subject of this fascinating documentary - Chilean Director Alejandro Jodorowsky - would think of paring down 136 minutes to just 90. The 84 year old director (best known for his first film ""El Topo"" ) is engaging in the lenthy interviews that form the central thread of director Frank Povich's project. (He certainly doesn't look 84!I won't repeat what has been said in the other reviews - about the plot and the amazing ""creative team"" that Jodorowsky assembled to make his 1975 film (years before Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Alien). Orson Welles and Salvador Dali (as actors), Pink Floyd for the score.  I'll, try to add some additional info to guide you in knowing more about the BD release. (A review copy was provided by the studio in advance of release date).As I said there is 46 minutes of ""deleted scenes"" - there are nine of these scenes. They include a section on the costumes, Frank Herbet's original science fiction novel ""Dune"", Jodorowsky on Hollywood, Jodorowsky's film philosophy and more. And then there is the theatrical trailer.The film takes an unusual approach to ""subtitles"" .  Because some of the interviewees speak French in the film, English subtitles are necessary. But director Povich has chosen to provide English subtitles even when Jodorowsky is speaking in English, which he does MOST of the time. The comments made by other English-speaking interviewees are not subtitled. The subtitles are in white print and are usually - but not always - easy to read (when there is a white background).Another thing I wanted to mention is that - even though the film (Dune) was never made, Jodorowsky had produced thick (and I mean 12 inches thick - or more!) volumes of the story boards of the script. Using the images from these books and computer technology (not available in 1975) Povich has ""animated"" sections to give the viewer a sense of ""what might have been"".  And a section near the end shows how Jodorowsky's work influenced later films by Lucas, Scott and others of modern day fantasy films.I'm not a big Sci-fi fan but I certainly enjoyed this BD and I know that any sci-fi film lover will relish every moment of it.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,"Review of Bluray- A ""must see for George Lucas and Ridley Scott fans - but fascinating to watch for others.",1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,2754,"['advertising', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'reviews', '2013', 'documentary', 'Jodorowsky', 'Dune', 'use', 'phrase', 'Greatest', 'Film', 'Never', 'Made', 'guess', 'am', 'too', 'right', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'five', 'words', 'story', 'deeper', 'post', 'review', 'are', 'already', '10', 'reviews', 'here', 'most', 'are', 'based', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'one', 'Bluray', '46', 'minutes', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'add', '90', 'minute', 'film', 'released', 'One', 'wonder', 'what', 'subject', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'Chilean', 'Director', 'Alejandro', 'Jodorowsky', 'would', 'think', 'paring', 'down', '136', 'minutes', 'just', '90', '84', 'year', 'old', 'director', 'best', 'known', 'first', 'film', 'El', 'Topo', 'engaging', 'lenthy', 'interviews', 'form', 'central', 'thread', 'director', 'Frank', 'Povich', 'project', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'look', '84', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'what', 'been', 'said', 'other', 'reviews', 'plot', 'amazing', 'creative', 'team', 'Jodorowsky', 'assembled', 'make', '1975', 'film', 'years', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'Alien', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Salvador', 'Dali', 'actors', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'score', ""'ll"", 'try', 'add', 'additional', 'info', 'guide', 'knowing', 'more', 'BD', 'release', 'review', 'copy', 'was', 'provided', 'studio', 'advance', 'release', 'date', '.As', 'said', '46', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'nine', 'scenes', 'include', 'section', 'costumes', 'Frank', 'Herbet', 'original', 'science', 'fiction', 'Dune', 'Jodorowsky', 'Hollywood', 'Jodorowsky', 'film', 'philosophy', 'more', 'then', 'theatrical', 'trailer.The', 'film', 'unusual', 'approach', 'subtitles', 'interviewees', 'speak', 'French', 'film', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'necessary', 'director', 'Povich', 'chosen', 'provide', 'English', 'subtitles', 'even', 'when', 'Jodorowsky', 'speaking', 'English', 'MOST', 'time', 'comments', 'made', 'other', 'English-speaking', 'interviewees', 'are', 'not', 'subtitled', 'subtitles', 'are', 'white', 'print', 'are', 'usually', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'read', 'when', 'white', 'background', 'thing', 'wanted', 'mention', 'even', 'film', 'Dune', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'Jodorowsky', 'had', 'produced', 'thick', 'mean', '12', 'inches', 'thick', 'more', 'volumes', 'story', 'boards', 'script', 'Using', 'images', 'books', 'computer', 'technology', 'not', 'available', '1975', 'Povich', 'animated', 'sections', 'give', 'viewer', 'sense', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'section', 'end', 'how', 'Jodorowsky', 'work', 'influenced', 'later', 'films', 'Lucas', 'Scott', 'others', 'modern', 'day', 'fantasy', 'films.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'Sci-fi', 'fan', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'BD', 'know', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'lover', 'will', 'relish', 'moment', 'it.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Jodorowsky's Dune

Many of those who would have been involved have passed away, and the others apparently weren't consulted for this movie, so we might never know.
