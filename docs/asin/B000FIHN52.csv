990558,AZWP97BZPJI1D,B000FIHN52,"Barnard Rollit ""Blant""","[0, 0]","This may be the only instance of a TV sitcom being re-imagined for the big screen and succeeding big time&#8212;not just one but twice! The producers showed rare perception in retaining the most essential aspect of the TV show: that this extremely peculiar family (with one exception) has no idea that they are in any way peculiar. The exception is young daughter Wednesday, played with chilling comic perfection by Christina Ricci, who does seem to see the larger world as being out of tune with the values her family holds dear, values she perhaps holds to more deeply and tenaciously because of that. (She certainly sees through the scam artists who try to take her family down in both films far more quickly than any of her relatives.) Another very special asset is the late and greatly lamented Raul Julia, who invests Gomez with enormous energy, charm and passion, all undergirded by delirious and indomitable lunacy. It's hard to imagine anyone else ever approaching, let along matching, his pedal-to-the-metal portrayal of the Addams patriarch.Anjelica Huston, on the other hand, delivers a fine Morticia. As calm and soft-spoken as Julia's Gomez is expansive and declamatory, Huston's Morticia makes the unusual aspects of their marital relationship as well as their parenting sound perfectly reasonable. Kudos also go to Christopher Lloyd's Fester for manfully carrying the burden of the plots of both films, a situation that somewhat restricts the character's ability to share in the happy madness of the rest of the family.If one character comes up a bit short, it's Lurch. Carel Struycken's version come straight from the Chas Addams cartoons rather than through the TV show&#8212;a looming, nonverbal presence who brings a nice touch of pathos to the proceedings. For all that, it's hard not to recall Ted Cassidy's somewhat more talkative Addams Family retainer as the more effective portrayal; the long-suffering yet stoic demeanor of that Lurch, along with his more direct interactions with the family members, were among the most memorable aspects of the TV show.",5,A Delightful Double-Header,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,2081,"['may', 'be', 'only', 'instance', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'being', 're-imagined', 'big', 'screen', 'succeeding', 'big', 'time', '8212', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'twice', 'producers', 'showed', 'rare', 'perception', 'retaining', 'most', 'essential', 'aspect', 'TV', 'show', 'extremely', 'peculiar', 'family', 'one', 'exception', 'idea', 'are', 'way', 'peculiar', 'exception', 'young', 'daughter', 'Wednesday', 'played', 'chilling', 'comic', 'perfection', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'who', 'seem', 'see', 'larger', 'world', 'being', 'tune', 'values', 'family', 'dear', 'values', 'perhaps', 'more', 'deeply', 'tenaciously', 'certainly', 'scam', 'artists', 'who', 'try', 'take', 'family', 'down', 'films', 'far', 'more', 'quickly', 'relatives', 'very', 'special', 'asset', 'late', 'greatly', 'lamented', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'who', 'Gomez', 'enormous', 'energy', 'charm', 'passion', 'undergirded', 'delirious', 'indomitable', 'lunacy', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'ever', 'approaching', 'let', 'matching', 'pedal-to-the-metal', 'portrayal', 'Addams', 'patriarch.Anjelica', 'Huston', 'other', 'hand', 'fine', 'Morticia', 'calm', 'soft-spoken', 'Julia', 'Gomez', 'expansive', 'declamatory', 'Huston', 'Morticia', 'unusual', 'aspects', 'marital', 'relationship', 'as', 'well', 'parenting', 'sound', 'perfectly', 'reasonable', 'Kudos', 'also', 'go', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Fester', 'manfully', 'carrying', 'burden', 'plots', 'films', 'situation', 'somewhat', 'character', 'ability', 'share', 'happy', 'madness', 'rest', 'family.If', 'one', 'character', 'up', 'bit', 'short', 'Lurch', 'Carel', 'Struycken', 'version', 'come', 'straight', 'Chas', 'Addams', 'cartoons', 'rather', 'TV', 'show', '8212', 'looming', 'nonverbal', 'presence', 'who', 'nice', 'touch', 'pathos', 'proceedings', 'hard', 'not', 'recall', 'Ted', 'Cassidy', 'somewhat', 'more', 'talkative', 'Addams', 'Family', 'retainer', 'more', 'effective', 'portrayal', 'long-suffering', 'yet', 'stoic', 'demeanor', 'Lurch', 'more', 'direct', 'interactions', 'family', 'members', 'were', 'most', 'memorable', 'aspects', 'TV', 'show']",The Addams Family / Addams Family Values

990571,A239PPUVV8O0U0,B000FIHN52,D. A. Reed,"[3, 3]","The Addams Family- I remember seeing this one when I was very young. Before I even saw the original series, I was hooked, including the animated version, which was being rerun on Cartoon Network at the time and the TV remake The New Addams Family (which is good in its own right, but not as good as the original of course). I couldn't have imagined anyone else playing these characters for the big screen (if they had made a movie of the original show in the 60s I'm sure I'd prefer that but that's a rant for another day). Anjelica Huston and the late, great Raul Julia have so much chemistry together, I can't help but be reminded of that same chemistry seen between Carolyn Jones and John Astin. Though due to a higher budget, Gomez can do more amazing feats than he could from the show. Not much is added to Morticia however but she's just as beautiful as ever (and great at her deadpan wit). A lot of my favorite bits from the film come from their scenes, especially when they reminisce about their first meeting at a funeral. Christoher Lloyd does a good job as Fester but I must say I do prefer Jackie Coogan's version. He was more offbeat and funny than Lloyd even after Fester recovers his memory. Christina Ricci is the only other person besides Lisa Loring to play Wednesday. I'm pretty sure she had a hard time keeping a straight face during the entire production. She and Jimmy Workman have a decent chemistry together but I wish they hadn't made Pugsley such an idiot, especially in the show when he was capable of mixing various chemicals. The plot is good but my main problem with the story in this and the sequel is that the main focus isn't the family but Uncle Fester. They make it seem that without him, the family can't function (how Gomez and the family survived for 25 years without him is a mystery). The music was excellent. My favorite music sequence is the party; first when Morticia and Gomez waltz, then reveal the entire party and the Mamushka sequence. Shaiman's version of the original theme is good but I wish it was used more. The only real bother I have is the Hammer songs used, especially the Addams Groove. 5 stars.Addams Family Values- This one is more in the vein of the original comic strips. A new baby is introduced into the house, causing sibling rivalry. A new nanny tries to kill Fester for his fortune (I liked it better when he was Morticia's brother because now everything revolves around him) and Wednesday and Pugsely are sent to summer camp and meet that guy from NUMB3RS. I have mixed feelings about the sequel. Its not a rehash of the first, except for the whole Fester/fortune gimmick. I like the idea of the children causing havoc in the camp and Fester having a love interest. But I just don't like it as much as the first for some odd reason. The original cast is good, though I don't know why they didn't get the same woman to play Grandmama. Peter MacNicol and Christine Baranski are just plain annoying as the camp counselors (good thing they got roasted but Baranski is one of my favorite actors). Joan Cusack is a delight as the deranged Debbie and I especially like the part when she tells them why she kills people. The original Addams theme is used more in this, especially during my favorite sequence (the Tango in the restaurant).

The last time I seen them where probably over 10 years ago & I oddly enough found it & seen it for a little over 10 bucks for the two on 1 Disc I decided why not wish the cases where thinner though. I have a DVD case that can only hold about 60 DVDs of this size on one shelf lol just wish I could hold 120 on one self but the case being thinner. About little more than 5 bucks a movie can't beat that on 1 disc. One thing I do wish they did more often on DVDs & Blu-rays are I wish they would added in behind the scenes and interview the actors in the movie the main actors anyways and get there point of view and there felling or something on the movie. One thing I disliked about getting this movie in the mail today is the disc was not locked into the case was rolling around I don't know if it happens during packaging or during shipment or what but it scratches the disc before it gets here I looked mine hardly had any maybe one tinny one but its the whole fact can be worse. But I would have like to see how they did the Special effects for this Movie & others in the late 80's to early 90's because they where amazing for not having alot of technologies. I don't know how directors & producers do it but they always & I mean always 95% of the time have the perfect person to play the perfect roll in any movie out there I don't know who they pick it or what they do to go threw picking the perfect people but in these they did it perfectly. I'm in a movie as an extra and its so much fun to do and play I know it was a minor roll & my movie is going to be able to be out to own on DVD in May of this year I cant wait the Directors and Producers where really nice was directed and produced in my town I cant wait to see it we been waiting for 2 yrs low budget film I am buying it on Amazon when comes out. But on another hang you guys would love this movie they don't make movies like this anymore that have low technologies and it not be all edited there not made like they used to be. Well enjoy movie if you rent it or buy it must see. One other dislike when they put the plastic covering over it so no one can get into it before braking the seal it always melts to the existing plastic and its totally annoying they should find a better alternative to it to fix that problem if possible.,4,Excellent movie must see,1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,2343,"['are', 'movies', 'enjoyed', 'Child', 'last', 'time', 'seen', 'where', 'probably', '10', 'years', 'oddly', 'enough', 'found', 'seen', 'little', '10', 'bucks', 'two', '1', 'Disc', 'decided', 'why', 'not', 'wish', 'cases', 'where', 'thinner', 'have', 'DVD', 'case', 'can', 'only', 'hold', '60', 'DVDs', 'size', 'one', 'shelf', 'lol', 'just', 'wish', 'could', 'hold', '120', 'one', 'self', 'case', 'being', 'thinner', 'little', 'more', '5', 'bucks', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', '1', 'disc', 'One', 'thing', 'do', 'wish', 'did', 'more', 'often', 'DVDs', 'Blu-rays', 'are', 'wish', 'would', 'added', 'scenes', 'interview', 'actors', 'movie', 'main', 'actors', 'anyways', 'get', 'there', 'point', 'view', 'felling', 'something', 'movie', 'One', 'thing', 'disliked', 'getting', 'movie', 'mail', 'today', 'disc', 'was', 'not', 'locked', 'case', 'was', 'rolling', 'around', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'packaging', 'shipment', 'what', 'disc', 'here', 'looked', 'mine', 'hardly', 'had', 'maybe', 'one', 'tinny', 'one', 'whole', 'fact', 'can', 'be', 'worse', 'would', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'did', 'Special', 'effects', 'Movie', 'others', 'late', '80', 'early', '90', 'where', 'amazing', 'not', 'having', 'alot', 'technologies', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'directors', 'producers', 'do', 'always', 'mean', 'always', '95', '%', 'time', 'have', 'perfect', 'person', 'play', 'perfect', 'roll', 'movie', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'pick', 'what', 'do', 'go', 'threw', 'picking', 'perfect', 'people', 'did', 'perfectly', ""'m"", 'movie', 'extra', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'do', 'play', 'know', 'was', 'minor', 'roll', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'out', 'own', 'DVD', 'May', 'year', 'cant', 'Directors', 'Producers', 'where', 'really', 'nice', 'was', 'directed', 'produced', 'town', 'cant', 'wait', 'see', 'been', 'waiting', '2', 'yrs', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'am', 'buying', 'Amazon', 'when', 'out', 'hang', 'guys', 'would', 'love', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movies', 'anymore', 'have', 'low', 'technologies', 'not', 'be', 'all', 'edited', 'not', 'made', 'used', 'be', 'Well', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'rent', 'buy', 'must', 'see', 'One', 'other', 'dislike', 'when', 'put', 'plastic', 'covering', 'so', 'no', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'braking', 'seal', 'always', 'existing', 'plastic', 'totally', 'annoying', 'should', 'find', 'better', 'alternative', 'fix', 'problem', 'possible']",The Addams Family / Addams Family Values

990577,A3USRUCHAOC3MT,B000FIHN52,"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff""","[1, 6]","In the Nashville Tennessean one year, the paper's movie reviewer gave a list of family movies that came out that year and gave a grade.  ""Beauty and the Beast"", the first animated Disney movie to earn a best picture nomination, received an A-.  The only movie that topped it, getting an A+ from the reviewer, was ""The Addams Family"".  The reason?  There was nobody who could be considered a role model.These are NOT family movies.  I don't believe a PG-13 rated movie can be qualified for it.  There is a lot of dark humor, and there is more sexyness in ""The Addams Family Values"".  I would probably not let anyone under 12 watch this even with parental supervision.It was funny in the second movie to see how the TV series theme popped up, such as Lurch playing it on the organ or an orchestra playing it at a restaurant.  And I wasn't prepared for hearing a Christmas carol at the beginning of the first one.The first movie was much better than the second.  If I saw the first one on TV, I might watch some of it.  If I saw ""Addams Family Values"" on TV, I'd change channels.The first did a better job with dealing with an ensemble.  ""Family Values"" really focused on two stars:  Fester and Wednesday.  While I loved Wednesday's comments when interviewing nannies, the second movie left a bad taste in my mouth.That being said, the cast is great.  The late Raul Julia was excellent in the role of Gomez.  Christopher Lloyd did great as Fester.  Christine Rikki stole the show (and maybe the soul as well) as Wednesday.  I also like Jimmy Workman as Pugsley.This was the first of two sitcom families to be revived in PG-13 movies.  The second, the Brady Bunch, had no business being made as a PG-13 movie.  The Addams family movies were more faithful to the original cartoon, and I don't feel it was inappropriate doing them as PG-13 movies.

990607,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B000FIHN52,R.A. McKenzie,"[4, 4]","Full disclosure --- I don't know diddily-squat about The Addams Family beyond these two movies and the theme song.*  Black-and-white TV show?  Watched one episode.*  Video games?  Played a few, sucked at all of them.*  Comic strips?  Never seen them.*  Cartoons?  Umm...there were cartoons?Now that we got that out of the way, this two-movie combo is a great dose of macabre comedy.  These two movies --- ""The Addams Family"" (1991) and ""Addams Family Values"" (1993) --- are filled with great style, terrific cast, and smart humor that continue to surprise.The highest of compliments must go the casting.  Every one is pitch-perfect in their roles, including the guest stars from each film.  I'll get the elephant in the room out of the way, first: Christina Ricci's Wednesday Adams absolutely steals every scene she's in.  Don't get me wrong, everyone is terrific with their work, but I think it's fair to say that what people will remember most about these movies (especially the sequel) is that adolescent Wednesday Adams is the one character we can't wait to see next.But to ramble on and on about Wednesday would be a disservice to the strong leads in Anjelica Huston and Raul Julia patriarchs Morticia and Gomez Adams.  Their constant infatuation and undying love for one another is delightfully creepy and intoxicatingly sensual...well...to each other anyway.  The total disregard (or confusion) at normal human behavior is simply The Addams Family behaving naturally, and Morticia and Gomez's encouragement of the strange rituals drives it all.  I don't know how else I would've imagined the Uncle Fester character before these movies, but after Christopher Lloyd's bizarre interpretation, I don't care.  His Fester is like a giant boy who hasn't quite escaped his childhood, no matter how hard he tries to abandon it.  Although the first movie sets up that quality, the sequel really puts it to the test.I feel bad skipping over the rest of the cast, but Granny, the dead-butler-walking Lerch, the young not-quite- sadist Puggsley, and even whomever did the movements for Thing (literally a crawling dismembered hand) deserve a ton of credit as well, even if just for keeping up with their scene-stealing co-stars.  Although the guest stars in the first ""Addams Family"" are well-cast (Elizabeth Wilson, Dan Hedaya, and Dana Ivey as schemers trying to rip off the family's wealth), the sequel's exclusive stars like Joan Cusack's black-widow who target's Uncle Fester, or Peter MacNicol & Christine Baranski as summer camp counselors who are continually horrified at the Addams' children's sense of reality, are even better.The stronger quality of the sequel's guest stars translates to the two films as a whole: ""Addams Family Values"" is superior to the original ""Addams Family"" in every way.  The jokes are funnier.  The actors are even more comfortable and daring in their roles.  More importantly, however, the story is much more interesting than the debut feature film.  In ""The Addams Family"" (1991), the setup revolves around Uncle Fester's mysterious return when he's under control of an adoptive mother.  It's great that the story takes a chance, and it's still a solid movie, but it's more strange than entertaining.  ""Addams Family Values"" (1993), on the other hand, cuts right to the chase with Morticia giving birth to a new child that the older siblings fail to murder time after time, while new nanny Debbie's sinister plot involving Uncle Fester is suspenseful and funny.  And when Wednesday and Puggsley are sent to summer camp...Holy Jesus, every single scene is gut-busting hilarious.Where the two movies are on equal ground is the production quality.  The work done by Ken Adam (""Values"" - most famous for Dr. Strangelove & some James 007 movies) and Richard MacDonald (the original movie - no slouch either despite his low key catalog) is incredible.  The Addams home is creepy, as if Halloween is just another day in the week.  Granny cooks up the most disgusting meals.  Lerch tends to colorless weeds & vines after Morticia cuts off the all the flower petals.  And the detailed graveyard fuels Morticia's & Gomez's hormones almost as much as their deathly dirty talk.  A stageplay involving Wednesday and Puggsley rival's any bloodspurt from the ""Kill Bill"" movies.  Even the more normal settings in ""Values"" have a creepy vibe to them, mainly because they're in such constrast to the Addams' usual surroundings.  The costuming (inspired from the comic strips & TV show, for sure) is dead-on.  The actors & designers had to make those ghoulish garments look like everyday apparel, and by God, they all made it work.  And Marc Shaiman's music rivals anything that Danny Elfman would've put together for this kind of material.Both films are worth adding to your library, but if you don't quite warm up to ""The Addams Family"", I urge you to give the sequel a try.  ""Addams Family Values"" is bigger and better, with its predecessor serving as a nice warmup.  We don't get enough creepy, darkly humorous movies like this anymore.  The best compliment you can give to a comedy: Laugh while at the same time asking yourself, ""How in the hell did they come up with and get away with THAT?""  Only in The Addams Family, that's for sure.",4,SNAP SNAP To It,1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,5257,"['Full', 'disclosure', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'diddily-squat', 'Addams', 'Family', 'two', 'movies',

It even says it's supposed to be wide screen on the disk itself, but its not. But the movies are the same great movies...just have to get over the full-screen formatting.The original Addams family movie is the return of Uncle Fester who lost at sea in the bermuda triangle and finds his way home with amnesia. Though the Addams are finally reunited they are separated again with the help of a greedy real-estate agent, lone shark, and less then friendly Judge. Forced out of the comfort of their mansion the Addams must learn to live with the outside world until Fester starts to remember life with his family and they band together to fight to get everything they had back to the way it was. Every Cast Member plays their roll wonderfully enough to make you forget they're not the original cast members to the TV show.The Addams Family Values is a sequel to the first movie with the original cast members (family members anyway...new evil characters are introduced).

With the new baby in the house Mortisha and Gomes decide to hire a nanny (Joan Cusack) who turns out to be a demented murder that agrees to marry Fester and tries to tear him apart from his family to steal the Addams Family fortune.",5,good spooky fun...,1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,1448,"['one', 'disk', 'set', 'movies', 'same', 'disk', 'movies', 'are', 'great', 'only', 'thing', 'bothered', 'are', 'not', 'wide-screen', 'format', 'promised', 'advertisements', 'even', 'supposed', 'be', 'wide', 'screen', 'disk', 'not', 'movies', 'are', 'same', 'great', 'movies', 'just', 'have', 'get', 'full-screen', 'formatting.The', 'original', 'Addams', 'family', 'movie', 'return', 'Uncle', 'Fester', 'who', 'lost', 'sea', 'bermuda', 'triangle', 'way', 'home', 'amnesia', 'Addams', 'are', 'finally', 'reunited', 'are', 'separated', 'again', 'help', 'greedy', 'real-estate', 'agent', 'lone', 'shark', 'less', 'then', 'friendly', 'Judge', 'Forced', 'comfort', 'mansion', 'Addams', 'must', 'learn', 'live', 'outside', 'world', 'Fester', 'remember', 'life', 'family', 'band', 'together', 'fight', 'get', 'everything', 'had', 'back', 'way', 'was', 'Cast', 'Member', 'roll', 'wonderfully', 'enough', 'make', 'forget', ""'re"", 'not', 'original', 'cast', 'members', 'TV', 'show.The', 'Addams', 'Family', 'Values', 'sequel', 'first', 'movie', 'original', 'cast', 'members', 'family', 'members', 'anyway', 'new', 'evil', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'Mortisha', 'giving', 'birth', 'baby', 'boy', 'new', 'baby', 'house', 'Mortisha', 'Gomes', 'decide', 'hire', 'nanny', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'demented', 'murder', 'marry', 'Fester', 'tries', 'tear', 'apart', 'family', 'steal', 'Addams', 'Family', 'fortune']",The Addams Family / Addams Family Values

That's because the movies are based more on the comics than the movies. You'd think that having two movies on one disc would make the quality really horrible. It doesn't. Both movies were single layer transfers, so there's no compression. The picture is clear and free of artifacts....for the most part. The only time anything is noticeable is during the very beginning of the movies when the picture is really dark. Both movies have trailers which are a lot of fun. If you're a fan of the Addams family, then you should get this dvd.
