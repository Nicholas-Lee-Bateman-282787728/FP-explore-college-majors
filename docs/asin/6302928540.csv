Even though the only way to do it is hire the unemployed, and give them make-work positions, this will be the legacy of an otherwise sleazy President before he turns the office over to a successor. Kevin Kline plays the part of the elected Commander in Chief, as well as a proprietor of an employment office (get the connection???). Sigourney Weaver is first lady who hates the 'pit vipers' who work for her husband and refuses to act out a role.The contrast between the two men only seems to highlight the difference between those who have no ethics but reach for high office, and those with ethics who 'want to change things for better' and run for local offices.Oh, there is a funny piece where Charles Grodin tries to balance the Federal budget....

A double will be required to substitute for the President. Dave Kovick is offered a chance to help the Government. The President inspects him, and approves: don't smile! The President is on a Top Secret Mission! But a stroke happens. Can this be kept secret? Dave will impersonate the President full-time. Can the Vice-President be replaced? ""He's OK."" The President is recovering. Dave picks up the mannerisms. Can he convince the First Lady? ""Yes!"" Dave plays the part well. Was he transformed? Real people appear as themselves. The President and First Lady visit a Homeless Shelter for Children. Is this a change in personality?The Presidential Veto affects Homeless Shelters. Murray visits to work on the budget. Can they rearrange the budget? Tough choices? Ellen suspects something. A secret passage leads to the lawn. They are pulled over in the street. ""Save your money."" Dave likes helping people [it requires power]. Will there be a conflict with Bob Alexander? Bill Mitchell has new proposals. Oliver Stone suspects changes in the President from the before and after photographs. [More humor?] Bob Alexander makes charges against Bill Mitchell. VP Nance is a good man. He started out selling shoes. There is a Joint Session, the President speaks about the First Liberty Bank scandal. There is a dramatic event! [This allows the end of the impersonation.] The President is rushed to the hospital, can he be saved? Did they switch bodies on the way to Bethesda Hospital? The nation goes into mourning. Gary Nance is now President.This comedy satire is funny in spots, and dramatic overall. It presents an insider's view to White House politics. Students of history will see the references. Do Bob and Alan remind you of Haldeman and Erlichman? Does VP Nance look like Ross Perot with a background like Truman? Does the coolness between Bill and Ellen resemble that of another Presidential couple? Years ago I read a book by a Secret Service Agent who resembled FDR and doubled for him at times. While rulers have used doubles for centuries there is no mention about the President's doubles (if he has any). Was this inspired by true events? The experienced doctors at Dallas said JFK was shot from the front. The body in Bethesda had a shot from the rear. This could have been done with the sacrifice of a Presidential double. Was that the hidden message in this comedy? Or just a wild idea from an Oliver Stone impersonator?",5,Impersonation in the White House,1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,2545,"['Dave', '1993', 'filmThe', 'film', 'White', 'House', 'helicopter', 'lawn', 'President', 'home', 'double', 'will', 'be', 'required', 'substitute', 'President', 'Dave', 'Kovick', 'offered', 'chance', 'help', 'Government', 'President', 'approves', 'do', ""n't"", 'smile', 'President', 'Top', 'Secret', 'Mission', 'stroke', 'Can', 'be', 'kept', 'secret', 'Dave', 'will', 'impersonate', 'President', 'full-time', 'Can', 'Vice-President', 'be', 'replaced', 'OK.', 'President', 'recovering', 'Dave', 'up', 'mannerisms', 'Can', 'convince', 'First', 'Lady', 'Yes', 'Dave', 'part', 'well', 'transformed', 'Real', 'people', 'appear', 'President', 'First', 'Lady', 'visit', 'Homeless', 'Shelter', 'Children', 'change', 'personality', 'Presidential', 'Veto', 'Homeless', 'Shelters', 'Murray', 'work', 'budget', 'Can', 'rearrange', 'budget', 'Tough', 'choices', 'Ellen', 'something', 'secret', 'passage', 'lawn', 'are', 'pulled', 'street', 'Save', 'money', 'Dave', 'helping', 'people', '[', 'power', ']', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'conflict', 'Bob', 'Alexander', 'Bill', 'Mitchell', 'new', 'proposals', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'changes', 'President', 'before', 'photographs', '[', 'More', 'humor', ']', 'Bob', 'Alexander', 'charges', 'Bill', 'Mitchell', 'VP', 'Nance', 'good', 'man', 'started', 'out', 'selling', 'shoes', 'Joint', 'Session', 'President', 'First', 'Liberty', 'Bank', 'scandal', 'dramatic', 'event', '[', 'end', 'impersonation', ']', 'President', 'rushed', 'hospital', 'can', 'be', 'saved', 'Did', 'switch', 'bodies', 'way', 'Bethesda', 'Hospital', 'nation', 'mourning', 'Gary', 'Nance', 'now', 'President.This', 'comedy', 'satire', 'funny', 'spots', 'dramatic', 'overall', 'insider', 'view', 'White', 'House', 'politics', 'Students', 'history', 'will', 'see', 'references', 'Do', 'Bob', 'Alan', 'remind', 'Haldeman', 'Erlichman', 'Does', 'VP', 'Nance', 'look', 'Ross', 'Perot', 'background', 'Truman', 'coolness', 'Bill', 'Ellen', 'resemble', 'Presidential', 'couple', 'Years', 'read', 'book', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Agent', 'who', 'resembled', 'FDR', 'doubled', 'times', 'rulers', 'have', 'used', 'doubles', 'centuries', 'mention', 'President', 'doubles', 'Was', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'experienced', 'doctors', 'Dallas', 'said', 'JFK', 'was', 'shot', 'front', 'body', 'Bethesda', 'had', 'shot', 'rear', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'sacrifice', 'Presidential', 'double', 'hidden', 'message', 'comedy', 'just', 'wild', 'idea', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'impersonator']",N/A

When Mitchell wants some private time with a White House aide, the Secret Service tracks down and hires Dave as a stand-in. But when Mitchell suffers from a massive stroke that leaves him incapacitated, White House Chief of Staff Bob Alexander (Frank Langella) decides to keep up the ruse longer than intended.

Meanwhile, First Lady Ellen Mitchell (Sigourney Weaver) notices her husband's strange new behavior.I found this movie to be a fun and lighthearted story. Kevin Kline nails his dual-roles. There are also many cameo appearances by real-life politicians and celebrities (such as Tip O'Neill and Jay Leno) that add to the fun. Despite the premise, this movie is not an overly serious satire of American politics nor is it a political drama. Instead, we get an optimistic movie with a happy ending.

I mean, it would never and could never happen and at the end of the day the actions of many in the film are headscratching in their preposterousness and yet, to be honest, it all kind of works thanks to the presentation.  From Kevin Kline's touching performance to Sigourney Weaver's biting sarcasm and felt honest to Frank Langella's embrace of pure evil, `Dave' offers up a lot of clich&eacute;s and stereotypes and yet we accept it gladly.  Sure, I would have loved a little more thought to have gone into the plot.  We never really understand what Bob Alexander's evil machinations are all about and the surface attempt at giving Dave a `purpose' or a `cause' felt tacked on and underdeveloped.  Still, Weaver is a dream from the minute she walks on the screen (""why can't you die from a stroke like everyone else?"") and Kevin Dunn drips charm behind his beard.  Kline is an actor I just kind of love to see in movies, and this was no exception.  He just `gets' it.  Seeing Linney, Kingsley and Rhames looking so young was fun, and at the end of the day this kind of mediocrity can be entertaining in the right doses.

I also agree that it provides the audience an insider's view of the world that is United States Presidency.What worries me, however, is the question of what sort of individual should the President of the United States be?  For that matter I extend this question to include any leader of a nation.  In this film the ""real"" President is a mean distant prick.  While Dave is a warm and open person who is concerned about the wellbeing of all Americans.  I certainly agree these characteristics are not only highly desired in a leader, but even required.  There is the issue that character Dave is a common man with no experience in politics whatsoever  This lack of experience would impair his ability to perform the tasks involved in being the President.  Not only that is that we have no idea of the character's background, specifically  the level and quality of education.It is clear that the makers of this film want to express an anti-elitist view on what sort of people should occupy political office, especially the presidency.This film was made in 1993, however in the context of recent history the subject is certainly very relevant today.  Does American society truly want a common man as President. Regardless of whether the people actually do, or not, I contend that they should not.  The job is extremely difficult one which requires very talented individuals with ideas that are well thought out, but also the image of the President must impress the international community.Can a person with only a mediocre education and a minimum of experience realistically meet the the same level of competency as as someone who has the very best background which includes graduating from the best schools i.e. Harvard, Yale and Princeton and significant experience in public office.Elitism in the media has recently been made to appear in a negative light.  To this I say do not the  people deserve the very best people with finest minds to lead rather someone who does not possess these qualities.The character of Dave is not the only example of character that is used to demonstrate the the film maker's argument.  The person who was the Vice President was originally a shoe salesman before running for office.  ha ha ha.  That is not even remotely realistic.  It may seem seem like a positive thing to other viewers of the film that a member of the executive would have such a background in order for him not to be an elitist, however, I ask the viewers to reconsider in the events of recent history.  Not to get to political but those who are against elitism in politics, specifically the Republicans should keep in mind that their past VP was a former CEO of Halliburton.  While this is an extremely distasteful corporate background to myself and and no doubt many others find it to be it still does prove a point.  No one who has been mayor of small town Wasilla, Alaska  which only has a population of 5,469 people and serves as Governor of Alaska for barely three years will ever be elected to the Executive.

346349,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,6302928540,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[4, 4]","One of the more charming romantic comedies of the 1990s, Dave is a Washington insider's dream - a dead president, behind the scenes power struggles, conspiracies, and lots of cameos by famous Washington politicians. Playing the title role, Kevin Kline comes across as an extremely likeable character, and Sigourney Weaver turns in one of the best performances of her career. In short, Dave is about the American Dream - the dream that anyone can grow up to be President of the United States. It's just that most people dream of taking a different route to the highest office in the land...Dave Kovic (Kevin Kline) is a normal American, living out the American Dream by running his own business - an employment agency. A charismatic and loved figure in his own community, Dave also happens to be a spitting image of the President of the United States. Around town, he's famous for his brilliant impressions of the president, and people take notice. In fact, the Secret Service also takes notice...One day, several Secret Service agents approach Dave in regard to acting as a double for the president. He agrees, and they hurry him off to a hotel where he's supposed to leave through the front entrance while the president sneaks out the back. But when the president suffers a stroke while having an affair with his secretary, Dave is retained by White House Chief Of Staff Bob Alexander (Frank Langella) and White House Communications Director Alan Reed (Kevin Dunn). The two men want Dave to fill in for the president while he recovers from his stroke, so as not to worry the general public.Convincing the nation is easy for Dave, but convincing First Lady Ellen Mitchell (Sigourney Weaver), even though her relationship with the president soured long ago, proves to be a far more formidable task. With Alexander running the show as de facto president - telling Dave what to do, what to say, and how to act - Dave decides to strike out on his own and start introducing legislation. Angered, Alexander his cohorts devise a scheme which will implicate Vice President Gary Nance (Ben Kingsley), an honest man, for past crimes committed by President Mitchell. Meanwhile, Alexander plans to have himself appointed Vice President after President Mitchell's stroke is announced to the public. The nefarious scheme would make Alexander the new president, but Dave has other ideas in mind. Teaming up with the first lady, he devises a plan of his own to foil the evil Bob Alexander...Like its contemporary, The American President, Dave doesn't take itself too seriously. Despite the absurd proposal of a guaranteed job for everyone (why not pass a bill that guarantees peace on earth?), the film doesn't pick a side between Republicans or Democrats. But more importantly, this film is funny. It's witty and entertaining. Dave isn't a film that was ever in danger of sweeping the Academy Awards (although it was nominated for a Best Screenplay Oscar), but instead it's a film that's just to be enjoyed. And it is enjoyable - that's why Dave ranks as a definite must-see film...The DVD Report",4,Highly entertaining...!,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,3081,"['One', 'more', 'charming', 'romantic', 'comedies', '1990s', 'Dave', 'Washington', 'insider', 'dream', 'dead', 'president', 'scenes', 'power', 'struggles', 'conspiracies', 'lots', 'cameos', 'famous', 'Washington', 'politicians', 'Playing', 'title', 'role', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'across', 'extremely', 'likeable', 'character', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'short', 'Dave', 'American', 'Dream', 'dream', 'anyone', 'can', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'just', 'most', 'people', 'dream', 'taking', 'different', 'route', 'highest', 'office', 'land', 'Dave', 'Kovic', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'normal', 'American', 'living', 'out', 'American', 'Dream', 'running', 'own', 'business', 'employment', 'agency', 'charismatic', 'loved', 'figure', 'own', 'community', 'Dave', 'also', 'be', 'spitting', 'image', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'town', 'famous', 'brilliant', 'impressions', 'president', 'people', 'take', 'notice', 'fact', 'Secret', 'Service', 'also', 'notice', 'One', 'day', 'several', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agents', 'approach', 'Dave', 'regard', 'acting', 'double', 'president', 'hurry', 'off', 'hotel', 'where', 'supposed', 'leave', 'front', 'entrance', 'president', 'out', 'back', 'when', 'president', 'stroke', 'having', 'affair', 'secretary', 'Dave', 'retained', 'White', 'House', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'Bob', 'Alexander', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'White', 'House', 'Communications', 'Director', 'Alan', 'Reed', 'Kevin', 'Dunn', 'two', 'men', 'want', 'Dave', 'fill', 'president', 'stroke', 'so', 'not', 'worry', 'general', 'public.Convincing', 'nation', 'easy', 'Dave', 'convincing', 'First', 'Lady', 'Ellen', 'Mitchell', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'even', 'relationship', 'president', 'soured', 'long', 'ago', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'formidable', 'task', 'Alexander', 'running', 'show', 'de', 'facto', 'president', 'telling', 'Dave', 'what', 'do', 'what', 'say', 'how', 'act', 'Dave', 'strike', 'out', 'own', 'start', 'introducing', 'legislation', 'Angered', 'Alexander', 'cohorts', 'devise', 'scheme', 'will', 'implicate', 'Vice', 'President', 'Gary', 'Nance', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'honest', 'man', 'past', 'crimes', 'committed', 'President', 'Mitchell', 'Meanwhile', 'Alexander', 'have', 'appointed', 'Vice', 'President', 'President', 'Mitchell', 'stroke', 'announced', 'public', 'nefarious', 'scheme', 'would', 'make', 'Alexander', 'new', 'president', 'Dave', 'other', 'ideas', 'mind', 'Teaming', 'up', 'first', 'lady', 'plan', 'own', 'foil', 'evil', 'Bob', 'Alexander', 'contemporary', 'American', 'President', 'Dave', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'absurd', 'proposal', 'guaranteed', 'job', 'everyone', 'why', 'not', 'pass', 'bill', 'peace', 'earth', 'film', ""n't"", 'pick', 'side', 'Republicans', 'Democrats', 'more', 'importantly', 'film', 'funny', 'witty', 'entertaining', 'Dave', ""n't"", 'film', 'was', 'ever', 'danger', 'sweeping', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Oscar', 'instead', 'film', 'just', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'enjoyable', 'why', 'Dave', 'definite', 'must-see', 'film', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

DeRiemer,"[4, 4]","Sweet natured, warm hearted, funny, a little sentimental, and with a surprising, sharp political edge best sums up, in my opinion, this story about a man who gets to play president, takes on the bad guys and gets the girl in a happy ending.President William Mitchell is a political sleaze who two-times his wife, Ellen (Sigourney Weaver), betrays his few principles and doesn't care much about anything. He frequently employs look alikes so he can have unnoticed time for his bimbos. But this time, after a major speech, while he's in the midst of love making, he has a major stroke in the arms of his latest girl friend. His double this time is a guy who runs a temp agency, who tries to help the people he comes into contact with and who has a sunny, open disposition. He's the kind of guy who sings ""Oklahoma!"" while riding his bike. He's named Dave Kovic and he's played by Kevin Kline in a first-rate performance of great charm and likeability. But the chief of staff, Bob Alexander (Frank Langella), an arrogant and condescending politico, plots to keep Dave in place by putting out the story that the president suffered only a ""minor circulatory problem of the head."" While the innocent lamb Dave covers as the president, Alexander will smear the vice president and force him to resign, then have himself named vice president...at which time Dave will go back to his old life and William Mitchell will be discovered to have had a second and incapacitating stroke. Bob Alexander will then become president.All goes according to plan until Dave begins to ask questions about helping the poor. He begins to connect with people. He and his best friend, Murray Blum (Charles Grodin) plot to find ways to locate $650 million in the budget to save a shelters program. All this drives Alexander into a frustrated rage. And during all this Dave and Ellen begin to make some connections of their own. She and her real husband had long since stopped having any feelings for each other. The conclusion of the movie is clever, satisfying, requires the complicity of Duane Stevenson (Ving Rhames), the president's secret service body guard, and split second timing.Some of the reasons this movie works so well, in my opinion, is that all the actors do fine jobs, not just Kline and Weaver. Langella is great (and amusing) as a king maker who wants to be king himself this time. Laura Linney carries off a small but important role with great humor and skill. Charles Grodin as Murray hits just the right note of funny, reluctant suspicion. Scattered throughout the movie are pointed interviews with media and political figures, commenting with dead pan seriousness on the activities of the president.The music gets a bit sappy at times, but that's not a major drawback. All in all, Dave is something of a throwback to the Frank Capra movies, but with a bit of a sting. I've watched it more than once and enjoy it. The DVD picture looks just fine.",4,Nicely Done: Frank Capra Meets Ivan Reitman,1119398400,"06 22, 2005",2005,2938,"['Sweet', 'natured', 'warm', 'hearted', 'funny', 'little', 'sentimental', 'surprising', 'sharp', 'political', 'edge', 'best', 'sums', 'up', 'opinion', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'play', 'president', 'bad', 'guys', 'girl', 'happy', 'ending.President', 'William', 'Mitchell', 'political', 'sleaze', 'who', 'wife', 'Ellen', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'few', 'principles', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'anything', 'frequently', 'look', 'alikes', 'can', 'have', 'unnoticed', 'time', 'bimbos', 'time', 'major', 'speech', 'midst', 'love', 'making', 'major', 'stroke', 'arms', 'latest', 'girl', 'friend', 'double', 'time', 'guy', 'who', 'temp', 'agency', 'who', 'help', 'people', 'contact', 'who', 'sunny', 'open', 'disposition', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'Oklahoma', 'riding', 'bike', 'named', 'Dave', 'Kovic', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'first-rate', 'performance', 'great', 'charm', 'likeability', 'chief', 'staff', 'Bob', 'Alexander', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'arrogant', 'condescending', 'politico', 'plots', 'keep', 'Dave', 'place', 'putting', 'out', 'story', 'president', 'suffered', 'only', 'minor', 'circulatory', 'problem', 'head', 'innocent', 'lamb', 'Dave', 'president', 'Alexander', 'will', 'smear', 'vice', 'president', 'force', 'resign', 'then', 'have', 'named', 'vice', 'president', 'time', 'Dave', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'old', 'life', 'William', 'Mitchell', 'will', 'be', 'discovered', 'have', 'had', 'second', 'incapacitating', 'stroke', 'Bob', 'Alexander', 'will', 'then', 'become', 'president.All', 'according', 'plan', 'Dave', 'ask', 'questions', 'helping', 'poor', 'connect', 'people', 'best', 'friend', 'Murray', 'Blum', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'plot', 'find', 'ways', 'locate', '650', 'million', 'budget', 'save', 'shelters', 'program', 'Alexander', 'frustrated', 'rage', 'Dave', 'Ellen', 'begin', 'make', 'connections', 'own', 'real', 'husband', 'had', 'long', 'stopped', 'having', 'feelings', 'other', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'clever', 'satisfying', 'complicity', 'Duane', 'Stevenson', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'president', 'secret', 'service', 'body', 'guard', 'split', 'second', 'timing.Some', 'reasons', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'opinion', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'jobs', 'not', 'just', 'Kline', 'Weaver', 'Langella', 'great', 'amusing', 'king', 'maker', 'who', 'be', 'king', 'time', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'small', 'important', 'role', 'great', 'humor', 'skill', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'Murray', 'just', 'right', 'note', 'funny', 'reluctant', 'suspicion', 'Scattered', 'movie', 'are', 'pointed', 'interviews', 'media', 'political', 'figures', 'commenting', 'dead', 'pan', 'seriousness', 'activities', 'president.The', 'music', 'bit', 'sappy', 'times', 'not', 'major', 'drawback', 'Dave', 'something', 'throwback', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'movies', 'bit', 'sting', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'more', 'once', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'picture', 'just', 'fine']",N/A

A very well written screenplay and a surprise that Hollywood would turn out something so wonderful given their usual depictions of politics in general. This is without a doubt my favorite film dealing with a political topic. The character of ""DAVE"" is so real and perfect for the oval office. He manages to turn around a corrupt government, balance the budget using down to earth every day person tactics and unites the country during his short term in office, as an imposter. He exposes those in high places who are trying to turn things to their own advantage, and brings a forgotten, unpopular Vice President to the fore front, to take the helm at a very crucial time for America. Many of us have often thought that the Presidency should be given to someone who is just a normal, every day American, without the wealth and prestige that is almost always associated with it.

Dave Kovic (Kevin Kline) is a likeable guy who runs a temp agency.  He also bears an uncanny resemblance to the President.  One day, some Secret Service agents show up at his house, recruiting him to act as a double.  Dave agrees, but then gets more than he bargained for.This is a fun, good-hearted movie.  Kline is endearing as the underdog who suddenly becomes the Commander and Chief.  The supporting cast is also strong, with good performances from Sigourney Weaver, Frank Langella, Ving Rhames, Ben Kingsley and especially Charles Grodin in limited screen time.  This comedy manages to steer clear of potty humor and the like that is so common in films today, and instead explores the subject with an almost childlike innocence.Parental Advisory: Dave is rated PG-13.  It does contain one adulterous sex scene that is heard more than seen (there is no nudity).  There is another scene where a man is seen showering through fogged glass.  His buttocks are visible briefly, but that's all.  There is some mild profanity at points and a couple abuses of God's name.  Other than these bits, it is a relatively tame movie.The quality of the Blu-ray transfer is quite good.  Details are sharp, and colors are strong.  The sound is a little bit soft, however--I had to crank it on my system.  The weird thing was that it would not go any higher than a certain point.  It sounded no louder at 60 than it did at 30.  When there was no background noise, it was okay.  But when my wife started doing some stuff in the kitchen, it made it difficult to hear the dialogue at times.  Nevertheless, I was still pleased with this Blu-ray.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is worth it.Dave is a light, heart-warming comedy.

346388,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6302928540,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","I presumed that unlike his peers, Frank Capra is the one filmmaking great whose style would be hard to replicate nowadays given his often Pollyanna approach to triumph over evil and corruption.  But director Ivan Reitman and screenwriter Gary Ross do a fine job with this 1993 comedy in evoking Capra's individualistic style in a contemporary setting taking on a typically Capraesque subject, the U.S. President as a man of the people versus the puppet of lobbyists and corporate interests. I was surprised at the light touch Reitman displays here after his heavy-handed ""Ghostbusters"", but it is a charming and amusing fable that reminds me a bit of Hal Ashby's ""Being There"" in its acute observation of open navet&eacute; in the face of seemingly insurmountable cynicism and duplicity.The unlikely plot focuses on Dave Kovic, who runs a small-town employment agency and also happens to be the spitting image of Bill Mitchell, the forty-fourth President of the United States. In a night of passion, Mitchell suffers a stroke and goes into a coma. His megalomaniac chief-of-staff Bob Alexander and fearful communications director Alan Reed convince Dave to substitute for Mitchell while he recovers. Of course, the ruse gets complicated as Dave starts to take his new job quite seriously, which sets up a showdown with Alexander that brings in the then-relevant S&L; scandals, and as Dave becomes attracted to Mitchell's estranged First Lady, Ellen. The casting is ideal. Other than Tom Hanks, no one but Kevin Kline could have portrayed Dave with such non-ironic decency and good humor. It's a shame his career has never taken off the way Hanks' has, as he seems to have moved recently to more sanctimonious dramas like ""Life as a House"" and ""The Emperor's Club"", movies that do not remotely capitalize on his chief assets, his acute sense of the absurd and graceful physical humor.  While Sigourney Weaver cuts a properly imposing and increasingly vulnerable figure as Ellen, I have to admit I find her a bit of a bore since there is not much emotional latitude with playing the First Lady. One misses the type of snappy, smart-mouthed dames that Jean Arthur and Barbara Stanwyck played to perfection in Capra's films. On the other hand, Frank Langella is almost effortlessly malevolent as Alexander, the perfectly insidious villain; though it would have been a stretch to think that such an obviously slimy character would have made it to the Oval Office without an image overhaul. The funny and underutilized Charles Grodin plays Murray Blum, Dave's accountant, who figures out the budget cuts the President should propose and sets Alexander's plans afire. Smaller roles are filled expertly with Ben Kingsley as the befuddled Vice-President, Ving Rhames appropriately one-note stoic as the head Secret Service agent and Laura Linney and Bonnie Hunt in miniscule parts.There are plenty of enjoyable scenes, my favorites being the Dave-as-President scenes of suddenly recognized empowerment and genuine euphoria, the traffic cop incident ending with an off-key rendition of ""Tomorrow"", and  the montage of celebrities commenting on Mitchell's changed personality ending with Oliver Stone's amusing conspiracy theory.  Reitman and Ross have really come up with a holistic view of Washington politics that is at once acerbic and hopeful, not an unimpressive feat when one thinks of the tone of current political films. In fact, ""Dave"" is as much a comment on the early, idealized Clinton years, as sadly, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is of the junior Bush years.

Unfortunately, Dave is not a &#34;clean&#34; movie.  I actually watch it with a ClearPlay filter.Early in the movie, there is a sex scene between the President and his secretary (no frontal nudity is shown, only bare shoulders and legs).  Later in the movie, the First Lady walks in on Dave in the shower. He is shown fully naked from behind through the shower glass. When he turns around to speak to her, the First Lady glances downward but no flesh is shown.  Near the end of the movie, a man and a woman are shown kissing passionately for several seconds.Two scenes in the movie depict a man having a stroke and being rushed to the hospital. There are minor curse words used throughout the movie and in several scenes, characters are drinking beer or wine for dinner and cocktails. There is no drunken/lewd behavior, violence/gore, drugs, or smoking scenes in this movie.The movie is about Dave, a temp agency owner, who is put in as a temporary stand-in for the U.S. President, but is convinced by the White House Chief of Staff, that he has a duty to take the job more permanently when the President has a stroke and goes into a coma.  The Chief of Staff has an agenda of his own: to hide the Presidents condition, pin some scandal (that he and the real President are actually responsible for) on the Vice President, so when the &#34;President&#34; has another stroke, this time more serious, he can name his Chief of Staff as the acting president.  However, Dave starts to get his own ideas about how things should be run.  Since the President was hired to do a job, and a temp job at that, he should care more about others than he does about himself. So, with the help of the head Secret Service agent and the first lady, Dave tries to turn things around.Overall, I like the movie.

My wife and I both thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  There is one scene, one of just a handful that added the -13 to the PG rating, that we had qualms about, but even that scene had a key place in the story.I love movies about ordinary people who find themselves in extraordinary circumstances and rise above them.  This is an example of such a movie, and it is great.  The cast is fantastic.  And it saves one funny scene for the end.One other good thing about this movie -- it uses real life politicians and political analysts.  The one draw back, which is normal (unfortunately) for Hollywood, is that the Democrats all side with the hero, while the Republicans are more skeptical.  I wish that every pro-Democrat movie would be matched with a pro-Republican movie, but it would take three years of every movie being pro-Republican to accomplish that (at least).I highly recommend this movie, and if you don't believe me, note how many 2 and 1 star reviews this movie received.

He is hired to serve as a double for the President of the United States.  However, things don't turn out as planned and Dave finds himself continuing his charade.The real President has suffered a stroke while making love to his secretary and Dave continues his impersonation.  The President's advisors don't want to inform Vice President Nance, played by Ben Kingsley, because Chief Of Staff Bob Alexander (Frank Langella) is jealous of him. Bob has his sights set on the Presidency, so he has sent the Vice President away on an African goodwill tour.  While the V.P. is gone, Bob begins digging up dirt about him.Meanwhile, Dave continues to learn more about the Presidency, and he's taking over some of the Presidential tasks.  Eventually, he meets First Lady Helen Mitchell, played by Sigourney Weaver.  The real President and First Lady have a very rocky relationship and they rarely see each other, but Dave is attracted to he immediately.Soon, Dave is making visits to factories and sitting in on Cabinet meetings, all the while charming everyone and watching the approval ratings soar.  While Dave is enjoying his success, Bob is seething.  He's angry that Dave has become so popular, and he fears losing his chance at the Presidency.  Also, Dave is beginning to see the schemer that Bob really is, and he asks for Bob's resignation.  This leads to Bob blowing the lid off a White House scandal involving the President and Vice President.  But due to some quick thinking by Dave, he manages to clear the Vice President and inform Congress that Bob was really behind the scandal.While addressing Congress, Dave fakes a reoccurance of the stroke that plagued the real President, paving the way for Vice President Nance to take over as President.  Dave then goes back to work at his Temp agency, having decided to run for city council, and he gets a little help from the former First Lady as well.I enjoyed this movie very much.

He has used it to make extra money & the White House had used him that very fateful night. The president is a rather mean sprited crook. He also cheats on his wife. While in bed with a young, female aide, he has a massive stroke. He is not going to survive. Instead of calling the vice-president, the president's Chief of Staff, a deliously evil, Frank Langella, calls on Dave to sit in as the president while he puts a rather complex plan into operation to seize the presidency for himself. He figures he can handle Dave & control the government from behind the scenes until his plan can go into effect. Time passes & President Mitchell still persists in a brain-dead coma. Dave starts to realize how criminally Langella has acted & starts exerting some authority. Meanwhile, he starts getting friendly with the first lady, Ellen (Sigourney Waever) who had been estranged from & ignored by the president. She knows about his affairs & soon figures out Dave is not the president. But he is interested in her pet project, helping homeless orphans which the president had rejected. So she doesn't blow the whistle & they begin to fall in love. When Dave becomes fully aware of Langella's criminality he fires him & the now ex-Chief of Staff plots revenge. The whole mess gets straightened out in the end. This movie puts me in mind of several movies that followed such as American President & Wag the Dog. My two favorite scenes were the first lady confronting Dave while he's in the shower. The scene of Langella, alone in the oval office softly humming 'Hail to the Chief' while he gleefully forges the president signature on various bills is priceless. Glossed over of course, is the fact that Dave & the first lady have themselves committed some serious crimes. But that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of this movie. In fact, you'll probably root for them.",4,"I''m sure that Kevin Kline, as President Bill Mitchell, was",1249516800,"08 6, 2009",2009,2153,"['channelling', 'first', 'George', 'Bush', 'glasses', 'mannerism', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'year', 'left', 'office', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', '10', '12', 'years', 'was', 'almost', 'like', 'new', 'Dave', 'likeable', 'naive', 'everyman', 'uncanny', 'resembalance', 'president', 'used', 'make', 'extra', 'money', 'White', 'House', 'had', 'used', 'very', 'fateful', 'night', 'president', 'rather', 'mean', 'sprited', 'crook', 'also', 'wife', 'bed', 'young', 'female', 'aide', 'massive', 'stroke', 'not', 'going', 'survive', 'Instead', 'calling', 'vice-president', 'president', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'deliously', 'evil', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Dave', 'sit', 'president', 'rather', 'complex', 'plan', 'operation', 'seize', 'presidency', 'can', 'handle', 'Dave', 'control', 'government', 'scenes', 'plan', 'can', 'go', 'effect', 'Time', 'President', 'Mitchell', 'still', 'brain-dead', 'coma', 'Dave', 'realize', 'how', 'criminally', 'Langella', 'acted', 'exerting', 'authority', 'Meanwhile', 'getting', 'friendly', 'first', 'lady', 'Ellen', 'Sigourney', 'Waever', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'estranged', 'ignored', 'president', 'affairs', 'soon', 'out', 'Dave', 'not', 'president', 'interested', 'pet', 'project', 'helping', 'homeless', 'orphans', 'president', 'had', 'rejected', ""n't"", 'blow', 'whistle', 'begin', 'fall', 'love', 'When', 'Dave', 'fully', 'aware', 'Langella', 'criminality', 'now', 'ex-Chief', 'Staff', 'plots', 'revenge', 'whole', 'mess', 'straightened', 'out', 'end', 'movie', 'mind', 'several', 'movies', 'followed', 'such', 'American', 'President', 'Wag', 'Dog', 'two', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'were', 'first', 'lady', 'confronting', 'Dave', 'shower', 'scene', 'Langella', 'alone', 'oval', 'office', 'softly', 'humming', 'Chief', 'gleefully', 'president', 'signature', 'various', 'bills', 'priceless', 'Glossed', 'course', 'fact', 'Dave', 'first', 'lady', 'have', 'committed', 'serious', 'crimes', ""n't"", 'detract', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'root']",N/A

Through a series of unlikely events, he ends up masquerading as the President after the genuine article has a massive stroke. His Chief of Staff (Frank Langela) uses him as a puppet, he inherits a first lady (Sigourney Weaver) who hates his guts, and it's all he can do to remember the names of his major advisors. As the story progresses, Dave struggles to keep the lie from being discovered while doing good for America.Like virtually any comedy, and especially these wish fulfillment types, Dave is not a movie whose plot would be called realistic. It's escapist entertainment, though it certainly has a message it wants to tell. Dave Kovic gets represents each of us in a way no elected President ever would, because he really is just an ordinary guy. His decency is touching and the movie does a good job of hammering home the theme that elected officials are there to serve the people, and not the other way around.One odd thing about this film is that it doesn't have many laughs for a comedy. It isn't that a lot of humor falls flat, the truth is that there aren't too many places where they really went for major laughs. This is more of a relaxed remake ofMr. Smith Goes to Washingtonthan it is a true comedy.This is an enjoyable movie, but its message is undercut by an apparent partisan blindness of the creators. Dave starts to leave the White House because he realizes that it's wrong to carry on the charade. Then he decides it's okay as long as he uses the power for causes he thinks are noble. Ouch. Dave and the Chief of Staff both try to take control illegally and both are equally wrong. The Vice President was elected by the people to serve if something happened to the President and Dave should have turned things over to him because it was the right thing to do, not because of a scandal. The filmmakers missed a golden opportunity to show that the means don't justify the ends and were apparently unaware that they sent the opposite message instead.Dave is an entertaining movie, and its heart is mostly in the right place. It certainly isn't a movie that will make you laugh until you cry, but it does have an easygoing sweetness that makes it easy to watch. It doesn't break Hollywood's pattern of vilifying conservatives, but it's not as abusive as most movies. The performances are all very well done and the story moves along smartly.

Gary Ross has made his reputation spinning stories of innocents caught up in the world of the not-so-innocent--or vice versa.  With Big, starring Tom Hanks, it was a 12-year old magically transformed into a 30 year old man, contending with the world of grownups.  In his latest film, Pleasantville, it's two hip, decidedly uninnocent teenagers zoomed into the innocent world of a typical 50s TV show.In this, his middle film, it's the owner of a copy shop, Dave, called on to impersonate the president--a high strung cad who's just suffered a heart attack.  Dave is a heck of a lot more innocent than most guys his age.  Divorced, he busies himself with his work and sports, always hoping to meet the right woman.What's groovy about this film is that it's a hip, comic American remake of the great Akira Kurosawa's Kagemusha.  In that film--a powerful drama with no comedy at all--a grievously ill warlord tells his vassals to find a man who resembles him as closely as possible so the warlord can instruct the other man in the ways of ruling a region; if his subjects see him alive and healthy, they'll be reassured and spies from enemy regions will know he's still a force to be reckoned with.The vassals find a commoner whose resemblance to the warlord is so striking, there's no one else who could do the job.  He's told exactly what to do, how to stand, sit, and do all the other stuff a warlord should.  The same happens in Dave--he learns what to do from the evil Frank Langella, the White House press secretary.  As Dave, Kevin Kline strikes the perfect balance of innocence and determination to right the wrongs so clearly in evidence.  And Sigourney Weaver does a more than credible job as the first lady who's charmed by this knowledgeable innocent.Also here are Ben Kingsley as the just as innocent Vice President (contrast this with his absolutely astounding performance in the recent Sexy Beast as a nasty rotten gangster!) and Ving Rhames, always reliable, as the secret service man who's on Dave's side all the way.Ross is one smart cookie.  Taking Kagemusha and updating it to 90s America, mixing it with big dollops of comedy and a poignant love story, was a great idea.  This film really works.

Usually, these greasy-palmed lechs are seen as no more than variations of Willy Stark from ALL THE KING'S MEN. But there have been a few notable exceptions: MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, and now director Ivan Reitman presents Kevin Kline as the sainted president-imposter of DAVE. The plot is nonsense, of course. Kline is a businessman who bears a stunning resemblance to the real president who unexpectedly suffers a stroke. Frank Langella, who also bears an equally stunning resemblance in both looks and attitude to former Nixon henchman Bob Haldeman, recruits Kline to stand in for the president. Kline's imposture is so convincing that everyone, including the president's wife (Sigourney Weaver), is fooled. Langella sees Kline only as a buffoon, easily manipulated until he is ready to annoint himself as the new president.The joy of DAVE is watching an updated version of the fish out of water routine. Kline is genuinely funny as he struggles to master the protocol needed to run the free world. What gives DAVE a touching resonance is the subtle transformation of Kline as the admitted fish out of water to a good-hearted human being who slowly realizes that the power of the presidency can do far more for America than merely enrich the one who sits in the Oval Office. Even the burgeoning romance between Kline as the fake president and Weaver who thinks him the real thing is touching. Director Reitman diluted the focus of interest with a deluge of cameos of famous politicians and Hollywood stars, all of whom do little more than add one moment of cheap laughs in a movie that tries hard for serious laughs about serious issues that range from who we are to who we might be. It is the totality of questions about the need to establish our moral center in our rightful identity that makes DAVE such a refreshing breath of air after the thundering blasphemies of that self-appointed crude politico Willy Stark.",5,Dave: Jimmy Stewart Returns as Kevin Kline,1041638400,"01 4, 2003",2003,2023,"['Hollywood', 'long', 'bashed', 'politicians', 'films', 'Usually', 'greasy-palmed', 'lechs', 'are', 'seen', 'more', 'variations', 'Willy', 'Stark', 'ALL', 'THE', 'KING', 'MEN', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'MR', 'DEEDS', 'GOES', 'TO', 'TOWN', 'MR.', 'SMITH', 'GOES', 'TO', 'WASHINGTON', 'THE', 'AMERICAN', 'PRESIDENT', 'now', 'director', 'Ivan', 'Reitman', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'sainted', 'president-imposter', 'DAVE', 'plot', 'nonsense', 'course', 'Kline', 'businessman', 'who', 'stunning', 'resemblance', 'real', 'president', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'stroke', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'who', 'also', 'equally', 'stunning', 'resemblance', 'looks', 'attitude', 'former', 'Nixon', 'henchman', 'Bob', 'Haldeman', 'Kline', 'stand', 'president', 'Kline', 'imposture', 'so', 'convincing', 'everyone', 'including', 'president', 'wife', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'fooled', 'Langella', 'Kline', 'only', 'buffoon', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'ready', 'annoint', 'new', 'president.The', 'joy', 'DAVE', 'watching', 'updated', 'version', 'fish', 'water', 'routine', 'Kline', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'master', 'protocol', 'needed', 'run', 'free', 'world', 'What', 'DAVE', 'touching', 'resonance', 'subtle', 'transformation', 'Kline', 'admitted', 'fish', 'water', 'good-hearted', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'slowly', 'power', 'presidency', 'can', 'do', 'far', 'more', 'America', 'merely', 'enrich', 'one', 'who', 'Oval', 'Office', 'Even', 'burgeoning', 'romance', 'Kline', 'fake', 'president', 'Weaver', 'who', 'real', 'thing', 'touching', 'Director', 'Reitman', 'diluted', 'focus', 'interest', 'deluge', 'cameos', 'famous', 'politicians', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'whom', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'add', 'one', 'moment', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'movie', 'hard', 'serious', 'laughs', 'serious', 'issues', 'range', 'who', 'are', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'totality', 'questions', 'need', 'establish', 'moral', 'center', 'rightful', 'identity', 'DAVE', 'refreshing', 'breath', 'air', 'thundering', 'blasphemies', 'self-appointed', 'crude', 'politico', 'Willy', 'Stark']",N/A
346468,A3O2Y1MVIY77IE,6302928540,"Mary McGreevey ""frwhiskey""","[0, 0]","This is a highly amusing and very well-acted film about the shenanigans one can find inside the White House at any given time.  Is the man speaking really your President, or is it an imposter, a look-alike, filling in while your real fellow is in a coma?  Will any of us really know who or what our Presidents are, let alone if they are fakes?This gem by the director of GHOSTBUSTERS shows a time in Washington awash in the euphoria of the post-Cold War, when our system and our Reagan adminstration, not to mention the internal conflicts of Communism, brought down Russia and the East Bloc nations.  Our military budgets were suddenly flush, our computer advances had made our country rich, the real estate prices were skyrocketing, and Clinton (even his wife, Hilary) looked good. That he was a glutton with little regard for anyone but himself - this was considered laughable, probably predictable, culminating in the low-down act of wannabe fornication with a Jewish female house aide, Lewinski.  Without shame, our President was on the prowl - as were many before him, especially Johnson and Kennedy, for the gullible females.  We're even shown the dark and slimy tunnel through which Johnson used to escape:  Dave uses it, too.In any case, this film is an enjoyable romp through the front and back corridors of power as our real President lays in a coma after a double stroke.  Actor Kevin Kline plays brilliantly a temp-office owner who's a dead ringer for the man in the White House, Bill Mitchell.  He gradually comes to truly enjoy his new role, rather rapidly gets beyond the waving and handshaking role, and is soon addressing his aides and experts personally, all in bluff.  He banks on his puppetmasters not willing to admit this charade, and takes advantage of speaking his mind on issues to do with homeless children and unemployment.  His audience is astounded at his change of heart, attributing it to his short and quick brush with death.  The nation and its TV commentators are singing his praises, for he seems to be a new man full of hope and change and energy.The audience, we happy citizens and taxpayers, sit and enjoy this charade at home or in a theater.  If it were true in reality, perhaps we would be upset for a moment or two, but upon quick reflection, we would shrug and admit, ""What difference does it make? They're all crooks.""  It turns out the real President Mitchell is indeed a crook in misappropriating funds along with his top advisors.  Our temporary step-in soon catches on to the hanky-panky and decides to address these millions stolen directly before a joint hearing of Congress and in impromptu White House press releases.  His real fellow's wife suddenly takes an interest in him, when in the real life, she despises her now almost-dead husband, his philandering, his ""misappropriations"", his callous indifference to the suffering of homeless and poor Americans.  She has become burnt out, angry and disgusted.  She awakens happily to the reality that a ""new man"" is in charge although he's a dead ringer for her real hubbie.Since most of us are burnt out about our government, due to exposure to our own and foreign crime shows and horror films generally, not to mention big fat history books available to all in public libraries, this film hits the funny bone of those still not too cynical to laugh.  I really enjoyed seeing the quick guest appearances of Tip O'Neill, Jay Leno and Arnold Schwarzenegger, along with many other Washington insiders, who were apparently happy to show up and play a part in this send-up of our US government and its shenanigans.IN the end, there's an attempt to make this film a ""Happy End"" film (as the Germans would call the genre), for our temp office owner does return to his true identity and tries to run for Alderman (or Councilman or Supervisor) as a starting point to get into politics, because he ""cares about helping people"".  That he misappropriated $650 million for his ""jobs"" program is irrelevant.  He CARES and we are supposed to be HAPPY that he CARES about the lack of jobs and the ensuring poverty.  Never mind that it has to be stolen from normal people in the first place in order to happen at all.  Hey, all you happy workers, keep on working and paying your taxes?The ex-first wife (with now truly dead husband, therefore a widow) comes looking for him and they have a deep kiss.  All is well!  Let them eat cake!  (i.e. your eggs, flour, butter and sugar...)What a story.But in the end, it's entertaining and well-done, and the older this film gets, the more you may enjoy its nostalgic feeling, the time before we all started worrying about TERRORISTS, not our own in-house thieves.Clinton, we salute your resolution to abstain from donuts,as Dave demonstrates with Schwarzenegger and kids!!!",5,Thought-provoking

When I went into my Prime account today to watch the second half, it was gone.

Its like they're moving all ""popular"" movies, the movies people actually want to watch, to the Fee based service and taking them out of the Prime membership.So upon seeing this, I promptly went into my account, and CANCELLED my Prime Membership.  So no, I will NOT be paying the increased rate of $99 dollars to renew my Prime membership next month.Prime was a good deal at one time, and I supposed if you buy lots of delivered products from them then you can probably make up the 100 bucks on shipping charges.

He is discovered riding a pig for an advertisment at a car dealership. The Secret Service finds him and ask him to play the decoy for the President at a speaking engagement.While he's being taken back home after playing decoy, there is an ""event"".

Kline (Silverado, A Fish Called Wanda) portrays a likable man with an uncanny resemblence to the President of the United States, also played by Kline.  The unlikable president has a stroke while having an affair with his assistant and Kline steps in to pinch hit while the nearly dead president stuggles to live.  (This is not the only film where Kline plays the president. He also portrayed President Grant in the forgetable Wild, Wild West).Sigourney Weaver (Alien, Ghostbusters, Gorillas in the Mist)  plays the wife who no longer loves her wandering husband and presents the greatest challange for Dave.  He must convince her that he is her husband and at first succeeds.  But once she realizes that the president is not her husband, things really get interesting.Frank Langella portrays the bad guy with verve, convincingly creating the constitutional crisis.

346523,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6302928540,Robert Morris,"[8, 10]","Simultaneously, this film offers both implausibilities and delightful entertainment, with several appealing suggestions as to which values the president of the United States should affirm and which priorities should guide and inform the president's initiatives. Directed by Ivan Reitman and starring Kevin Kline as Dave Kovic, the basic situation is this: Bill Mitchell, the current president, suffers a massive stroke while abed with one of his mistresses and is totally incapacitated, sustained by life support technologies. Kovic has been earning a modest living as a Mitchell impersonator and accepts an offer from Mitchell's chief of staff (Bob Alexander) skillfully portrayed by Frank Langella) to take on a full-time assignment to replace Mitchell. What is Alexander's objective? To ensure that his political power base is protected. For a while, Ellen Mitchell (Sigourney Weaver) is deceived because she and her husband had had almost no personal contact in recent years. Other than Alexander, his accomplice Alan Reed (Kevin Dunn) and Duane Stevenson (Ving Rhames, also brilliant as the Secret Service agent in charge), the First Lady and everyone else think that Kovic is Mitchell. And then....I have no problem with the implausibilities because they create so many opportunities to affirm the the aforementioned values which, in my opinion, define ""compassionate conservatism."" For example, with the aid of his accountant and friend Murray Blum (Charles Grodin is also brilliant), Kovic is able to save a compellingly humanitarian project by trimming hundreds of millions of waste from the federal budget. This situation reminds me of one which sets up the climax in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) when a filibuster by interim Senator Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) defeats a pork barrel bill and thereby protects a Boy Rangers camp. Naive? Corny? Unrealistic? Perhaps to some but so what? I admire Dave because this contemporary version of ""The Prince and the Pauper"" has crisp direction, an engrossing plot, charm, wit, and stellar acting. The performance by Ben Kingsley (as Vice President Vance) is also noteworthy but I still have apprehensions about including news media journalists (playing themselves) such as Bernard Kalb, Larry King, John McLaughlin, and Helen Thomas. One clever touch is the cameo appearance by Oliver Stone who offers a conspiracy theory to explain President Mitchell's ""bizarre"" behavior. Those who share my high regard for Dave should check out Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Meet John Doe (1941), and Primary Colors (1998).",5,Compassionate Conservatism Worthy of the Name,1091145600,"07 30, 2004",2004,2571,"['Simultaneously', 'film', 'implausibilities', 'delightful', 'entertainment', 'several', 'appealing', 'suggestions', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'should', 'affirm', 'priorities', 'should', 'guide', 'inform', 'president', 'initiatives', 'Directed', 'Ivan', 'Reitman', 'starring', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Dave', 'Kovic', 'basic', 'situation', 'Bill', 'Mitchell', 'current', 'president', 'massive', 'stroke', 'abed', 'one', 'mistresses', 'totally', 'incapacitated', 'sustained', 'life', 'support', 'technologies', 'Kovic', 'been', 'earning', 'modest', 'living', 'Mitchell', 'impersonator', 'offer', 'Mitchell', 'chief', 'staff', 'Bob', 'Alexander', 'skillfully', 'portrayed', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'take', 'full-time', 'assignment', 'replace', 'Mitchell', 'What', 'Alexander', 'objective', 'ensure', 'political', 'power', 'base', 'protected', 'while', 'Ellen', 'Mitchell', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'deceived', 'husband', 'had', 'had', 'almost', 'personal', 'contact', 'recent', 'years', 'Other', 'Alexander', 'accomplice', 'Alan', 'Reed', 'Kevin', 'Dunn', 'Duane', 'Stevenson', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'also', 'brilliant', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'charge', 'First', 'Lady', 'everyone', 'else', 'think', 'Kovic', 'Mitchell', 'then', '.I', 'have', 'problem', 'implausibilities', 'create', 'so', 'many', 'opportunities', 'affirm', 'aforementioned', 'values', 'opinion', 'define', 'compassionate', 'conservatism', 'example', 'aid', 'accountant', 'friend', 'Murray', 'Blum', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'also', 'brilliant', 'Kovic', 'able', 'save', 'compellingly', 'humanitarian', 'project', 'trimming', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'waste', 'federal', 'budget', 'situation', 'one', 'up', 'climax', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', '1939', 'when', 'filibuster', 'interim', 'Senator', 'Jefferson', 'Smith', 'James', 'Stewart', 'pork', 'barrel', 'bill', 'thereby', 'Boy', 'Rangers', 'camp', 'Naive', 'Corny', 'Unrealistic', 'Perhaps', 'so', 'what', 'admire', 'Dave', 'contemporary', 'version', 'Prince', 'Pauper', 'crisp', 'direction', 'engrossing', 'plot', 'charm', 'wit', 'stellar', 'acting', 'performance', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Vice', 'President', 'Vance', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'still', 'have', 'apprehensions', 'including', 'news', 'media', 'journalists', 'playing', 'such', 'Bernard', 'Kalb', 'Larry', 'King', 'John', 'McLaughlin', 'Helen', 'Thomas', 'One', 'clever', 'touch', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'who', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'explain', 'President', 'Mitchell', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'who', 'share', 'high', 'regard', 'Dave', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'Meet', 'John', 'Doe', '1941', 'Primary', 'Colors', '1998']",N/A

Far as I am concerned that's reason enough to recommend this obviously implausible but ponderous jump through far-fetched political hoops.The premise is so loose it dangles -- an incumbent US president becomes terminally ailed (hints of satire in how that happens) only to be temporarily faux-replaced with a lookalike, who in turn develops a conscience but effortlessly fools the entire coterie of house helpers, senate and the public at large.Some characters such as a certain malicious minister and his crony are so cardboard you could punch right through them, which is indeed what you end up wishing you could do. There's even a cameo by Ben Kingsley, ever the confident propreitor of the moment, as the wrongly accused vice president.Yet, it must be the magnetic screen presence of Kline with his comic chips firmly in place or some fairly resonating dialogue that overcomes the highly porous plotline. I delayed sleep in the wee hours to sit through these proceedings with rapt attention, and the denouement is very rewarding as it wraps everything up in 'correct' ribbons.Political conscience and subdued romance when smoothly blended and lightly stirred make for a very refreshing drink.

346538,AI0KXH1O95X0H,6302928540,"Sir Robert ""Order of the Anglophiles""","[9, 9]","What would you do, as a fulfillment of office, if you were given the chance to stand-in for the President of the United States? ""Dave"" answers this question in a light political comedy that is sure to please anyone. The film may not be as intelligent a material as ""The American President,"" but it is still a winner in its own right, and much more.A stroke while on adulterous sex has the incumbent President incapacitated by stroke, and look-alike Dave is secretly planted into the position by the scheming Chief of Staff to prevent the ""Boy Scout"" VP from taking it otherwise (the movie leaves us to deduce much of the Chief's hidden agenda. It is quite bloody when you think about it.) Other than a breach in democracy and the breaking of a multitude of laws, what follows is the heartwarming story of a White House adventure that is very satirical, endearing, funny, melancholic and ultimately romantic.Originally, I thought of giving this film four stars, but changed my mind since having noticed that it got better and better with each viewing. Having seen this film more than once, I also found out that what makes ""Dave"" work is not only its ability to warm the heart, but to make it soar as well. We find a connection with Dave (Kevin Kline) that makes us want to give him a big hug for the things he did in the White House. What is mostly curious is the movie's ability to arouse the pride of the nation, all the while saying (and portraying) that ""the country has a lot of problems that we don't want to face them anymore.""The wonderful storyline is seasoned with:1.) lots of excellent performances (to name one, watch Frank Langella silently boil over as he helplessly watches Dave do cuts with the budget,)2.) lots of cameos by real-life politicians, and personalities from TV, film and media, lending credibility to an otherwise incredible story.3.) lots of comic moments,4.) some one-line punchers such as Sigourney Weaver's ""Go to hell..."" (for a 1993 movie, this remark seems to hail a future event,) Charles Grodin's ""Get out of here as fast as you can!"", and the sudden and uncalled for remark of the real president, "" &iexcl;Kjust get rid of that grin, you look like a schmuck.""5.) and at least a seemingly irrelevant (and short) but ultimately funny scene where the dialogue veered into the topic of thick necks and sweaters.This movie is bound to raise different kinds of questions. It makes us ask why things are always otherwise than that of the movie. Could be that this is bred from our want of political heroes, something which our modern world lacks and lacks and lacks. My answer, ""Let the film inspire you."" However on the other side, one will find implausible such a scenario as the film's premise. My answer, ""Who cares??""",5,DAVE SHINES,1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,2754,"['What', 'would', 'do', 'fulfillment', 'office', 'were', 'given', 'chance', 'stand-in', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'Dave', 'question', 'light', 'political', 'comedy', 'sure', 'please', 'anyone', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'intelligent', 'material', 'American', 'President', 'still', 'winner', 'own', 'right', 'much', 'more.A', 'stroke', 'adulterous', 'sex', 'incumbent', 'President', 'incapacitated', 'stroke', 'look-alike', 'Dave', 'secretly', 'planted', 'position', 'scheming', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'prevent', 'Boy', 'Scout', 'VP', 'taking', 'otherwise', 'movie', 'deduce', 'much', 'Chief', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'quite', 'bloody', 'when', 'think', 'Other', 'breach', 'democracy', 'breaking', 'multitude', 'laws', 'what', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'White', 'House', 'adventure', 'very', 'satirical', 'endearing', 'funny', 'melancholic', 'ultimately', 'romantic.Originally', 'thought', 'giving', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'changed', 'mind', 'having', 'noticed', 'got', 'better', 'better', 'viewing', 'Having', 'seen', 'film', 'more', 'once', 'also', 'found', 'out', 'what', 'Dave', 'work', 'not', 'only', 'ability', 'warm', 'heart', 'make', 'soar', 'as', 'well', 'find', 'connection', 'Dave', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'want', 'give', 'big', 'hug', 'things', 'did', 'White', 'House', 'What', 'mostly', 'curious', 'movie', 'ability', 'arouse', 'pride', 'nation', 'while', 'saying', 'portraying', 'country', 'lot', 'problems', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'face', 'anymore', 'wonderful', 'storyline', 'seasoned', 'with:1', 'lots', 'excellent', 'performances', 'name', 'one', 'watch', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'silently', 'over', 'helplessly', 'watches', 'Dave', 'do', 'cuts', 'budget', '2', 'lots', 'cameos', 'real-life', 'politicians', 'personalities', 'TV', 'film', 'media', 'lending', 'credibility', 'otherwise', 'incredible', 'story.3', 'lots', 'comic', 'moments,4', 'one-line', 'punchers', 'such', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Go', 'hell', '1993', 'movie', 'remark', 'hail', 'future', 'event', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'Get', 'here', 'as', 'fast', 'can', 'sudden', 'uncalled', 'remark', 'real', 'president', 'iexcl', 'Kjust', 'get', 'rid', 'grin', 'look', 'schmuck.', '5', 'least', 'seemingly', 'irrelevant', 'short', 'ultimately', 'funny', 'scene', 'where', 'dialogue', 'veered', 'topic', 'thick', 'necks', 'sweaters.This', 'movie', 'bound', 'raise', 'different', 'kinds', 'questions', 'ask', 'why', 'things', 'are', 'always', 'otherwise', 'movie', 'Could', 'be', 'bred', 'want', 'political', 'heroes', 'something', 'modern', 'world', 'lacks', 'lacks', 'lacks', 'My', 'answer', 'Let', 'film', 'inspire', 'However', 'other', 'side', 'one', 'will', 'find', 'implausible', 'such', 'scenario', 'film', 'premise', 'My', 'answer', 'Who']",N/A

346542,A3ODVVP9XO42L,6302928540,Steven R. Travers,"[2, 33]","The film &quot;Dave&quot; went through a script change. The story of a Presidential look-alike (Kevin Kline) who fills in for the secretly deceased real thing, the original story featured a Republican who brought his skills as a small entrepreneur to the job. Hollywood turned him into a Democrat, but kept his G.O.P common sense, such as when he and his partner look at the Federal budget and balance it by using the methods any small businessman would use. Naturally, pet liberal projects are all interjected while &quot;Republican priorities&quot; are given the heave-ho. You can search far and wide, and you will not find Hollywood films that openly portray a Democrat as the bad guy. I wrote a screenplay a few years ago called &quot;A Murderous Campaign&quot;. It had all the elements of a great script. A beautiful porn star has an affair with a Democrat Louisiana Senator. She overhears him plotting the assassination of a political rival, but they find out she heard the plan. They try to kill her, so she goes into hiding and hooks up with a crusty old Washington reporter who is considered kooky because he has been accusing this Democrat of these crimes for years. A retired FBI friend of the reporter helps them. The Democrat announces a Presidential bid. The porn star uses her considerable charms and discovers that the Governor of New Jersey is the assassination target at a Statue of Liberty rally. She saves the Governor, and the plot is revealed, but the Democrat candidate goes into spin control. Nobody can really prove the plan. It looks like he will win the nomination, having weathered the politics of personal destruction. Finally, the porn girl and the reporter find the old father of the Democrat's chief of staff, a former Ku Klux Klansman who wants to get what he knows off his chest before passing from this mortal coil. He tells them about the drug smuggling operation the candidate has been running in the Louisiana Bayou. The reporter's FBI pal arranges a raid. They discover all the &quot;smoking gun&quot; evidence of a series of political murders going back years. The girl is re-united with her family, gets out of the porn business, the reporter wins the Pulitzer, and it is jail time for the Democrat. The end.Creative execs who loved the verbal pitch when I simply described the Democrat as a &quot;politician,&quot; a &quot;candidate&quot; or the &quot;Senator&quot; all passed when they read the part in the script that identifies him as an actual Democrat. Pamela Anderson would be perfect as the porn chick. I could see Denzel Washington as the reporter, and Gary Busey as the Democrat Senator. I was asked if I would change him to a Republican. My answer was that I wanted to maintain the realism of the story.

The ""little guy"" here is Dave (Kevin Kline), a good-hearted temp agent who happens to be a dead ringer for President Bill Mitchell, a corrupt philanderer. When President Mitchell suddenly falls into a coma, his advisors will do anything to prevent power from falling into the hands of the Vice President, even if it means deceiving the nation by having Dave pretend to be Mitchell. However, when Dave starts to see the advisors' cynical politicking for what it is, he becomes determined to follow his own conscience and try to use his position to help people.Of course, one has to suspend disbelief while watching this movie, as impossible as the plot is [even the First Lady (Sigourney Weaver) doesn't notice the switch right away], but this doesn't make it any less enjoyable. It's a lighthearted comedy, a cute love story, and a meditation on the way things could be if politics truly revolved around the good of the people.",4,Change Comes to Washington,1233446400,"02 1, 2009",2009,1096,"['Dave', 'sweet', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'just', 'little', 'while', 'Washington', 'was', 'run', 'not', 'dishonest', 'politicians', 'little', 'guy', 'little', 'guy', 'here', 'Dave', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'good-hearted', 'temp', 'agent', 'who', 'be', 'dead', 'ringer', 'President', 'Bill', 'Mitchell', 'corrupt', 'philanderer', 'When', 'President', 'Mitchell', 'suddenly', 'coma', 'advisors', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'prevent', 'power', 'falling', 'hands', 'Vice', 'President', 'even', 'deceiving', 'nation', 'having', 'Dave', 'pretend', 'be', 'Mitchell', 'However', 'when', 'Dave', 'see', 'advisors', 'cynical', 'politicking', 'what', 'determined', 'follow', 'own', 'conscience', 'try', 'use', 'position', 'help', 'people.Of', 'course', 'one', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'watching', 'movie', 'as', 'impossible', 'plot', '[', 'even', 'First', 'Lady', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', ""n't"", 'notice', 'switch', 'right', 'away', ']', ""n't"", 'make', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'lighthearted', 'comedy', 'cute', 'love', 'story', 'meditation', 'way', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'politics', 'truly', 'revolved', 'good', 'people']",N/A

A cross between MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON and THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER the movie is entertaining and fun to watch due to Kevin Kline's performance in a semi-dual role.  He's Dave Kovic,a temp agency manager, who is a dead-ringer for the President of the United States, Bill Mitchell. Dave is tapped to take over the presidency when Mitchell suffers a irreversible stroke during an extramarital rendezvous.  Dave becomes President ""in-body"" only becoming a puppet to the the President's Chief of Staff, Bob Alexander (played to villianous perfection by Frank Langella).  At first he just follows along but then gets caught up in the ""job"" when the fine line between pretending and reality gets broken.  This is further enhanced when the First Lady, Ellen Mitchell (Sigourney Weaver) comes into the picture. The most hilarious segment is when President ""Dave"" brings in his accountant buddy Murray (Charles Grodin) to tweak the national budget in order to save some homeless shelters that the First Lady is counting on. What works in this film is the human element bringing plausibility to an absurd premise. Kevin Kline's performance brings to mind a Jimmy Stewart-type performance (hence the reference to Capra-esque and ""Mr Smith..."") and the support roles are spot-on perfect.  Charles Grodin's Murray Blum is small, but it's very effective and funny. Sigourney Weaver is good as always. Kevin Dunn as Alan Reed does a great job as Bob/Langella's co-conspirator who gets a change-of-heart about Dave. Ben Kinglsey as vice-President Nash has a great intimate scene with Dave/Kline. Lastly, Ving Rhames as Duane, the no-nonsense presidential body-guard is excellent (""I'd taken a bullet for you!""). The film is very topical for its day as comments are shown from TONIGHT SHOW host Jay Leno and there is very hilarious segment as Oliver Stone, fresh from making JFK thinks there is a conspiracy and urging Larry King and the public to compare photographs of 'President Mitchell' before and after his ""stroke"".  Overall, a very entertaining  film from Ivan (GHOSTBUSTERS) Reitman that works because of great casting and characters and making something seemingly impossibe..believable. The 90's was a great movie era for the ""president"" movies due to the optimsim of the Clinton administration.  A couple more years later, AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT, would be equally successful.",4,Dave's Not Here!,1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,2469,"['film', 'DAVE', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'Capra-esque', 'point', 'optimism', 'feel', 'good', 'ending', 'cross', 'MR', 'SMITH', 'GOES', 'TO', 'WASHINGTON', 'THE', 'PRINCE', 'AND', 'THE', 'PAUPER', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'watch', 'due', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'performance', 'semi-dual', 'role', 'Dave', 'Kovic', 'temp', 'agency', 'manager', 'who', 'dead-ringer', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'Bill', 'Mitchell', 'Dave', 'tapped', 'take', 'over', 'presidency', 'when', 'Mitchell', 'irreversible', 'stroke', 'extramarital', 'rendezvous', 'Dave', 'President', 'in-body', 'only', 'becoming', 'puppet', 'President', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'Bob', 'Alexander', 'played', 'villianous', 'perfection', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'first', 'just', 'along', 'then', 'caught', 'up', 'job', 'when', 'fine', 'line', 'pretending', 'reality', 'broken', 'further', 'enhanced', 'when', 'First', 'Lady', 'Ellen', 'Mitchell', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'picture', 'most', 'hilarious', 'segment', 'when', 'President', 'Dave', 'accountant', 'buddy', 'Murray', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'tweak', 'national', 'budget', 'order', 'save', 'homeless', 'shelters', 'First', 'Lady', 'counting', 'What', 'film', 'human', 'element', 'bringing', 'plausibility', 'absurd', 'premise', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'performance', 'mind', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart-type', 'performance', 'hence', 'reference', 'Capra-esque', 'Mr', 'Smith', 'support', 'roles', 'are', 'spot-on', 'perfect', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'Murray', 'Blum', 'small', 'very', 'effective', 'funny', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'good', 'always', 'Kevin', 'Dunn', 'Alan', 'Reed', 'great', 'job', 'Bob/Langella', 'co-conspirator', 'who', 'change-of-heart', 'Dave', 'Ben', 'Kinglsey', 'vice-President', 'Nash', 'great', 'intimate', 'scene', 'Dave/Kline', 'Lastly', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'Duane', 'no-nonsense', 'presidential', 'body-guard', 'excellent', ""'d"", 'taken', 'bullet', 'film', 'very', 'topical', 'day', 'comments', 'are', 'shown', 'TONIGHT', 'SHOW', 'host', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'very', 'hilarious', 'segment', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'fresh', 'making', 'JFK', 'thinks', 'conspiracy', 'urging', 'Larry', 'King', 'public', 'compare', 'photographs', ""'President"", 'Mitchell', 'before', 'stroke', 'Overall', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'Ivan', 'GHOSTBUSTERS', 'Reitman', 'great', 'casting', 'characters', 'making', 'something', 'seemingly', 'impossibe..believable', '90', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'era', 'president', 'movies', 'due', 'optimsim', 'Clinton', 'administration', 'couple', 'more', 'years', 'later', 'AN', 'AMERICAN', 'PRESIDENT', 'would', 'be', 'equally', 'successful']",N/A
