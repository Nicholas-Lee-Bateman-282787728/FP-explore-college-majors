Salama,"[3, 7]","Let me first start with the obvious: antisemitism has been a serious problem throughout history, present in many societies and causing the deaths of million of Jews. That said, the problem with this movie is that it views the United States - probably the most welcoming society ever to Jews outside of Israel - as a not very different place from Nazi Germany. Set in 1943, the movie is about a Christian man (William H. Macy) who gets confused with a Jew after he starts wearing glasses!. A number of very nasty things happen to him after that (he loses his job and he is unable to find a new one, the neighbors won't talk to him, all ending up in a violent confrontation). From one of Arthur Miller's self pitying, patronizing novels, the sort that gave liberalism a bad name.",2,Poor movie on a serious subject,1169078400,"01 18, 2007",2007,777,"['Let', 'first', 'start', 'obvious', 'antisemitism', 'been', 'serious', 'problem', 'history', 'present', 'many', 'societies', 'causing', 'deaths', 'million', 'Jews', 'said', 'problem', 'movie', 'United', 'States', 'probably', 'most', 'welcoming', 'society', 'ever', 'Jews', 'Israel', 'not', 'very', 'different', 'place', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'Set', '1943', 'movie', 'Christian', 'man', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'who', 'confused', 'Jew', 'wearing', 'glasses', 'number', 'very', 'nasty', 'things', 'happen', 'job', 'unable', 'find', 'new', 'one', 'neighbors', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'ending', 'up', 'violent', 'confrontation', 'one', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'self', 'pitying', 'patronizing', 'novels', 'sort', 'gave', 'liberalism', 'bad', 'name']",N/A

The story seemed to strain to meaning at times and then before you knew it, something profound happened.While the basic thrust of this movie is the evil of anti-semitism, there is not a lot of ""coloring around the edges.""An example is the character who plays Larry Newman's mother:  She is on-screen for about five minutes and you wonder why they even had her there at all.  Then there is the role of Finkelstein, the prime victim of racism who has about 15 or 20 minutes screen time.It seemed to me that the purpose of this film was to drive a single, (and I DO mean single) point across and then end it as soon as possible.  It's like the director said ""We've a job to do, so let's do it and get out of here.""  As far as the point of the movie, I got that in about 10 minutes.

I enjoyed the movie, though it's not the kind of movie that maybe your average movie goer might get into. It's a movie for thinkers, a movie for people who like to peel back a few layers and find a redemptive message. Indeed, the message is a strong and powerful one, and William H. Macy and Laura Dern do justice to their roles (oh yeah, there's comedy in this movie, too --- just watch the way Laura Dern walks, if that's not comedy here, what is?).  For the life of me, though, I can't figure how anyone would think a pair of glasses would make you look jewish; no, would cause you to be TREATED as a Jew --- even by the people who have known you for years and know that you are NOT a Jew! Also, I'm with the one reviewer who said that you'd think the guy would ditch the glasses since he wanted so much to stop being treated like a Jew.  I just couldn't understand that.

Wonderful performance from William Macy and an ever-enchanting Laura Dern as the leads.  Both think each other are Jewish.  Miller, ex-husband of Marilyn Monroe, who is still alive as of 2004, was considered the dean of American naturalism before drama went off in another direction. Here he exploits his beautiful story sense to focus our horror on the historical tragedy of political factions who think they can fix the world by broadly identifying the particular group of others who are threatening it, thus giving themselves a sense of identity organized by murderous hatred no less than would-be righteous indignation. The leads mistake each other for Jewish even as they know they are not but the world, throwing a noose of love around their attempts to escape this case of mistaken identity, tightening it as they try to wriggle free.

686793,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00005V1XK,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","Though fairly devoid of dramatic twists or serious action, FOCUS succeeds in being a nonetheless gripping film. Based on a novel by playwright Arthur Miller, FOCUS goes deep in a subtle, parabolic way about the danger and ultimate silliness of ethnic/religious/racial/etc prejudice, how public perception and treatment can be radically changed merely by the style of someone's new eyeglasses, and so on. Set in the melting pot of NYC during World War II, it's sobering in its revelations of antisemitism--and in the process, prejudice against any other ""non-white"" group--on American soil. While it doesn't actually show the war in Europe, the radio broadcasts of Allied victories against the murderously racist Nazis provide an ironic backdrop to the film. FOCUS truly captures the 1940s: It doesn't just show the setting--It puts you right in it.The characterization of protagonist Lawrence Newman and William Gacy's performance as same are a little flat: He's a bit too much of a quintessential white, nerdy, mainline Anglo-Saxon Protestant office worker. At the same time, this seems deliberate and serves to carry the point of the film in many respects. Otherwise, most of the acting is quite impressive, with excellent performances by Laura Dern as Newman's new-found love and former rock star ""Meatloaf"" as Newman's go-with-the-majority Teamster neighbor.",4,"""When they make up their own mind about who you are, it's over""",1396656000,"04 5, 2014",2014,1362,"['fairly', 'devoid', 'dramatic', 'twists', 'serious', 'action', 'FOCUS', 'being', 'nonetheless', 'gripping', 'film', 'Based', 'novel', 'playwright', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'FOCUS', 'deep', 'subtle', 'parabolic', 'way', 'danger', 'ultimate', 'silliness', 'ethnic/religious/racial/etc', 'prejudice', 'how', 'public', 'perception', 'treatment', 'can', 'be', 'radically', 'changed', 'merely', 'style', 'someone', 'new', 'eyeglasses', 'so', 'Set', 'melting', 'pot', 'NYC', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'sobering', 'revelations', 'antisemitism', 'process', 'prejudice', 'other', 'non-white', 'group', 'American', 'soil', ""n't"", 'actually', 'show', 'war', 'Europe', 'radio', 'broadcasts', 'Allied', 'victories', 'murderously', 'racist', 'Nazis', 'provide', 'ironic', 'backdrop', 'film', 'FOCUS', 'truly', '1940s', ""n't"", 'just', 'show', 'setting', 'right', 'it.The', 'characterization', 'protagonist', 'Lawrence', 'Newman', 'William', 'Gacy', 'performance', 'same', 'are', 'little', 'flat', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'quintessential', 'white', 'nerdy', 'mainline', 'Anglo-Saxon', 'Protestant', 'office', 'worker', 'same', 'time', 'deliberate', 'serves', 'carry', 'point', 'film', 'many', 'respects', 'Otherwise', 'most', 'acting', 'quite', 'impressive', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'Newman', 'new-found', 'love', 'former', 'rock', 'star', 'Meatloaf', 'Newman', 'go-with-the-majority', 'Teamster', 'neighbor']",N/A

Though my figure says it grossed less than $800,000 in America, it is well worth watching. Maybe not a big feather in William H. Macy's Meteoric-Rise-Cap, but good, solid drama.Macy is Larry Newman, a plain newspaper personnel fellow in the 1940s. Late one night he witnesses a rape, and soon is forced to get glasses for his reading problems. My wife thinks this happened due to his witnessing the crime and doing nothing about it. The instant he puts the glasses on, everyone in the world thinks he's Jewish (his character is of English descent and Presbyterian).His bigoted neighbor Fred (spectacular performance by Meatloaf, here credited as ""Meat Loaf Aday"") is a foot soldier for the ""union crusaders"" hot on Larry's heels. Once Fred has had his fill staring at Larry's new glasses, he decides Larry must be 'funny'. He knows Larry is not Jewish - but it doesn't stop everyone from assuming Larry is a leftie, pinkie, you name it.Larry loses his job and teams up with Gorgeous Gertrude (a great turn by Laura Dern), whom he soon marries. The tide of hatred, especially in the face of the ongoing World War II, is only one of Larry's trials. He must also face union intimidation and his own prejudices against Jews. (Starting with Gert, who may or may not be Jewish.)I saw little redeeming storyline as this thing progressed. It causes the viewer to anticipate fireworks, but it fizzles to an end. If it had a powerful message (stop hatred), it seems to have smothered itself by the end.The Toronto neighborhood where this was filmed might look familiar: the Jewish-themed SNOW IN AUGUST (see my review) was filmed here, right down to the Jewish corner-store. Apparently it makes a good stand-in for almost-Jewish New York. Yet the Jews in the film (a nice role by the ever wonderful David Paymer, the only significant Jewish role here) are cardboard-dartboard characters. I tried to find significance in that treatment; all I can conclude is the director had no real idea how to present the Jewish community fairly here.If you are at all a film connoisseur, I recommend this in any case, even though I'm compelled to give it a C+",3,"""No one calls me a Jew and gets away with it!!""",1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,2211,"['FOCUS', '2001', 'one', 'rare', 'early', '2000', 'films', 'got', 'see', 'new', 'figure', 'grossed', 'less', '800,000', 'America', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'Maybe', 'not', 'big', 'feather', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Meteoric-Rise-Cap', 'good', 'solid', 'drama.Macy', 'Larry', 'Newman', 'plain', 'newspaper', 'personnel', 'fellow', '1940s', 'Late', 'one', 'night', 'rape', 'soon', 'forced', 'get', 'glasses', 'reading', 'problems', 'wife', 'happened', 'due', 'witnessing', 'crime', 'doing', 'nothing', 'instant', 'glasses', 'everyone', 'world', 'Jewish', 'character', 'English', 'descent', 'Presbyterian', '.His', 'bigoted', 'neighbor', 'Fred', 'spectacular', 'performance', 'Meatloaf', 'here', 'credited', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'Aday', 'foot', 'soldier', 'union', 'crusaders', 'hot', 'Larry', 'heels', 'Once', 'Fred', 'had', 'fill', 'staring', 'Larry', 'new', 'glasses', 'Larry', 'must', 'be', ""'funny"", 'Larry', 'not', 'Jewish', ""n't"", 'stop', 'everyone', 'assuming', 'Larry', 'leftie', 'pinkie', 'name', 'it.Larry', 'job', 'teams', 'up', 'Gorgeous', 'Gertrude', 'great', 'turn', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'whom', 'soon', 'marries', 'tide', 'hatred', 'especially', 'face', 'ongoing', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'only', 'one', 'Larry', 'trials', 'must', 'also', 'face', 'union', 'intimidation', 'own', 'prejudices', 'Jews', 'Starting', 'Gert', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Jewish', 'saw', 'little', 'redeeming', 'storyline', 'thing', 'progressed', 'viewer', 'anticipate', 'fireworks', 'end', 'had', 'powerful', 'message', 'stop', 'hatred', 'have', 'smothered', 'end.The', 'Toronto', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'was', 'filmed', 'might', 'look', 'familiar', 'Jewish-themed', 'SNOW', 'IN', 'AUGUST', 'see', 'review', 'was', 'filmed', 'here', 'right', 'down', 'Jewish', 'corner-store', 'good', 'stand-in', 'almost-Jewish', 'New', 'York', 'Jews', 'film', 'nice', 'role', 'ever', 'wonderful', 'David', 'Paymer', 'only', 'significant', 'Jewish', 'role', 'here', 'are', 'cardboard-dartboard', 'characters', 'tried', 'find', 'significance', 'treatment', 'can', 'conclude', 'director', 'had', 'real', 'idea', 'how', 'present', 'Jewish', 'community', 'fairly', 'here.If', 'are', 'film', 'connoisseur', 'recommend', 'case', 'even', ""'m"", 'compelled', 'give', 'C+']",N/A

Penned by Arthur Miller, ""Focus"" may well be an excellent novel (can't say for sure; have not read it), but as produced and directed by Neal Slavin, 'focus' is precisely what this movie lacks. It tries to take on too much, straining credibility in the process. For example, the whirlwind romance and subsequent marriage of main character Larry Newman (William H. Macy) is totally beyond belief. Perhaps instead Newman and his wife (Laura Dern) should have been introduced as a married couple from the beginning, freeing up more time to 'focus' on Finkelstein (David Paymer), who was about the only character in this production who wasn't a caricature. It is he who asks the probing questions which the movie strains but fails to answer.Meanwhile, Newman is no hero. Not until the victim dies some weeks or months later is he willing to take the minimal step of contacting the police, even as he witnessed the crime in progress from the beginning. Macy is always a good choice for portaying the meek, milquetoast types, but Newman is over-the-top, making him therefore much more a part of the problem than the solution, and consequently not a sympathetic character. It is this kind of wimpyness which allows the prevalence of Pack Mentality to become so treacherous in the first place; more dangerous even than the initial hatred(s) which incite it to begin with. There will always be scumbuckets among us; it is only when they are able to seduce others and frighten away the rest that they become a major threat.But the average person with an intact brain realizes this, one would think.

He is using his experience and observation of antisemitism in New York to build a vision of neighborhood Nazism, with a movement called Union Crusaders fighting against non-Christians. The story uses the clever device of a hero who is a non-Jew, who happens to look a bit like the Jewish stereotype and who happens to be a bit of an outsider who dislikes meetings and groups and handclapping and cheering, and who marries a woman with a German name, which supports the suspicions.The story is scary and easily transports from 1945 to any time you want to look at.The film skillfully supports this feeling of not being in a specific historical time by non-realistic settings for the suburban neighborhood. You never make the mistake to think that you are in a real place, it is always like a stage.

Macy has a rare starring role as Lawrence Newman, a forty-something bachelor living with his invalid mother in Brooklyn towards the end of World War Two. Newman is the painfully nerdy personnel manager of a large, anonymous New York City firm. One day, his boss all but orders Lawrence to get some eyeglasses to correct his bad eyesight. Ever the good company man, Newman complies. Unfortunately, the eyewear chosen makes him appear even more a geek. As his mother puts it, they also make him ""look Jewish"", not a good thing considering the anti-Semitism that's boiling to the surface in their blue-collar neighborhood directed at the owner of the corner market, Mr. Finklestein. The contextual source of this bigotry isn't well explained by the storyline, but it apparently stems from the feeling in some quarters that, rather than fighting the Nazis, America should be allied with Germany, ostensibly a Christian country, against godless communism and its assumed fellow-travelers, the Jews.Newman seems well aware of the effect of the glasses on how others perceive him. So, as he's subjected to increasingly outrageous discrimination, one wonders why he doesn't simply pitch them in the nearest dumpster and wear something less provocative. But, he stubbornly doesn't, and then complicates his situation by falling for Gertrude (Laura Dern), a blond, Love Goddess ironically perceived as also Jewish because of her flamboyance. Eventually, these two WASPs must choose whether to join their neighbors' anti-Semitic organization, move away, or stand and fight.It's a treat to see Macy, a wonderful actor usually seen in supporting performances, in a lead role. Unfortunately, his Newman character garnered little sympathy from this viewer when right at the film's outset he witnesses the nighttime beating and probable rape of a Puerto Rican woman by one of his neighbors, and doesn't even have the courage to call the police. Indeed, while Lawrence occasionally shows sparks of gumption, it's almost always in selfish response to his own victimization and nobody else's.  However, having said that, Macy does a superb acting job. Laura Dern is sparkling as the flashy Gertrude in a role vaguely reminiscent of that in RAMBLING ROSE.FOCUS has the feel of a live theater production. The streamlined scenes are relatively uncluttered with supernumerary characters or action. (The scene in the church towards the end seems positively congested.) Indeed, the director successfully isolates the plot's time and place from the rational part America going about its everyday business. The viewer barely realizes that, outside this one block in Brooklyn, America is at war and about to invade Normandy. I like the way the director was able to narrowly FOCUS on the phenomenon of ethnic stereotyping without muddling up the message with extraneous subplots. As a result, however, the film is perhaps more instructive than entertaining.

686800,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00005V1XK,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[31, 33]","Approaching Arthur Miller's heavily moral tale cinematically, one could fashion a straightforward story that would very possibly leave the audience both stony-faced and weary upon exiting the theater.  What director Neal Slavin has done is to imbue this film with striking visuals including occasional, intense dream images that make this an unusual work, easily transcending the realm of the ordinary.Set in the 40s in Brooklyn, New York, the story concerns a mild-mannered joe, Newman, played by the always-engaging William Macy who works as a human resources officer in a nameless firm.  Single, he lives alone with his mother; his lifestyle and mannerisms brand him as something between convention-abiding milquetoast and lonely recluse.  There's an ever-present edge to Newman--whenever he smiles, you can't tell if he's trying desperately to feel inside what should accompany the corners of his mouth turning up, or if he is truly pained making the effort.Into his life comes Gertrude Hart, played brilliantly by Laura Dern.  This is very likely one of her best roles; she's flawless here.  Sassy, fun-loving, but simultaneously caught up in the ruthless rule of the mob, she both fights and gives into Newman, letting us know that love can happen, but that social convention can easily sway how it goes.The vicious anti-Semitism on display here is typified well by none other than Meat Loaf--perfectly cast in Fight Club, and here just as effective.  As Newman's next door neighbor, he effortlessly vacillates between sham innocence and the crude, fearful hostility of &quot;them&quot;--Jews, blacks, whoever--that those of his ilk live to destroy.  Kenneth Welsh does a superb job as Father Crichton, modeled after the real-life Father Coughlin, who preached undying hatred of non-white, non-Christian people, American or not.  And David Paymer turns in an equally impressive performance as Finkelstein, the Jewish owner of a newstand on the corner of Newman's block who bears the brunt of the bigotry on display.The strongly noir atmosphere that pervades the film underlines the dark nature of the story quite well.  Similarly, Newman's strange and sometimes horrific dream images let us know that there's more to him than a pained expression.  Inside, his doubts scream at him constantly.This is not a film to run to for an evening of escape, but one instead to see when you're interested in something quite different.  And quite telling, given the circumstances of the day.",4,Morality with style,1004745600,"11 3, 2001",2001,2484,"['Approaching', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'heavily', 'moral', 'tale', 'cinematically', 'one', 'could', 'fashion', 'straightforward', 'story', 'would', 'very', 'possibly', 'leave', 'audience', 'stony-faced', 'weary', 'exiting', 'theater', 'What', 'director', 'Neal', 'Slavin', 'done', 'imbue', 'film', 'striking', 'visuals', 'including', 'occasional', 'intense', 'dream', 'images', 'make', 'unusual', 'work', 'easily', 'transcending', 'realm', 'ordinary.Set', '40s', 'Brooklyn', 'New', 'York', 'story', 'mild-mannered', 'joe', 'Newman', 'played', 'always-engaging', 'William', 'Macy', 'who', 'human', 'resources', 'officer', 'nameless', 'firm', 'Single', 'alone', 'mother', 'lifestyle', 'mannerisms', 'brand', 'something', 'convention-abiding', 'milquetoast', 'lonely', 'recluse', 'ever-present', 'edge', 'Newman', 'whenever', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'trying', 'desperately', 'feel', 'what', 'should', 'accompany', 'corners', 'mouth', 'turning', 'up', 'truly', 'pained', 'making', 'effort.Into', 'life', 'Gertrude', 'Hart', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'very', 'likely', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'flawless', 'here', 'Sassy', 'fun-loving', 'simultaneously', 'caught', 'up', 'ruthless', 'rule', 'mob', 'fights', 'Newman', 'letting', 'know', 'love', 'can', 'happen', 'social', 'convention', 'can', 'easily', 'sway', 'how', 'vicious', 'anti-Semitism', 'display', 'here', 'typified', 'well', 'none', 'other', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Fight', 'Club', 'here', 'just', 'effective', 'Newman', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'effortlessly', 'sham', 'innocence', 'crude', 'fearful', 'hostility', 'quot', 'quot', 'Jews', 'blacks', 'whoever', 'ilk', 'live', 'destroy', 'Kenneth', 'Welsh', 'superb', 'job', 'Father', 'Crichton', 'modeled', 'real-life', 'Father', 'Coughlin', 'who', 'preached', 'undying', 'hatred', 'non-white', 'non-Christian', 'people', 'American', 'not', 'David', 'Paymer', 'equally', 'impressive', 'performance', 'Finkelstein', 'Jewish', 'owner', 'newstand', 'corner', 'Newman', 'block', 'who', 'brunt', 'bigotry', 'display.The', 'strongly', 'noir', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'dark', 'nature', 'story', 'quite', 'well', 'Similarly', 'Newman', 'strange', 'sometimes', 'horrific', 'dream', 'images', 'let', 'know', 'more', 'pained', 'expression', 'Inside', 'doubts', 'scream', 'constantly.This', 'not', 'film', 'run', 'evening', 'escape', 'one', 'instead', 'see', 'when', ""'re"", 'interested', 'something', 'quite', 'different', 'quite', 'telling', 'given', 'circumstances', 'day']",N/A

686802,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005V1XK,Reviewer,"[14, 16]","Without question, film is a powerful medium, more so now than ever before, due to the accessibility of DVD/video, which gives the filmmaker the added assurance that his story or message is going to be seen by possibly millions of people.  Use of this medium, therefore, attaches an innate responsibility to the artist, inasmuch as film can be educational, as well as entertaining, which dictates that certain subjects should be approached accordingly and with a corresponding sensitivity and sensibility.  A film like Spielberg's ""Schindler's List,"" for example, is important, in that it keeps alive the memory of that which must not be forgotten, and as history tends to repeat itself, Spielberg's film can be viewed as a valuable tool in preventing a recurrence of that tragedy.  In that same vein, this film, ""Focus,"" directed by Neal Slavin, is important, in it illuminates the problematic reality of anti-Semitism, which for years beyond number has affected millions of people, is still unimaginably prevalent today, and like any manifestation of bigotry, will perpetuate itself if left unchecked or ignored.  Born of a xenophobic strain, it's a disease infecting society which, unabated, could be terminal; and with it's penetrating insights into the condition, this film is an effective vaccine that just may at the very least help stem the proliferation of it, and hopefully may act as a step toward eradicating it altogether.Lawrence Newman (William H. Macy) served his country in the Great War, and has since lived a quiet, conventional life in New York.  He's had the same job as a personnel director for some twenty years, and owns the house, located in an average, middle-class neighborhood, in which he lives with his mother (Kay Hawtrey).  Lawrence is the kind of guy who gets by just fine by minding his own business and refusing to involve himself with matters that are not (he feels) his concern.All of that is about to change, however, as with the advent of World War 2, Lawrence, along with the owner of the corner market, Mr. Finkelstein (David Paymer), inexplicably finds himself a target of the neighborhood xenophobes, who have aligned themselves with the ""Union Crusaders,"" a national organization currently taken to channeling their fears and hatred upon Jews, or anyone who even ""looks"" like a Jew.  And suddenly Lawrence finds that he can no longer just stand on the sidelines and watch the game being played; because now, he IS the game, whether he wants to be or not.Working from an intelligent, well written screenplay by Kendrew Lascelles, which he adapted from Arthur Miller's novel, Slavin presents a chilling scenario that incisively examines the effects of bigotry upon those against whom it is leveled; and when one considers the fact that this is not merely a hypothetical situation, but a depiction of reality, it becomes all the more disquieting, even unnerving.  And what makes the film so effective is Slavin's obvious grasp of his subject, and his studied presentation, which is thought-provoking in it's subtlety.  In the opening scene, Slavin establishes Lawrence's ""character,"" and very soon afterward reaffirms it in another scene, which affords the audience the opportunity to observe and assimilate how Lawrence's mind actually works; the thought processes that direct his life.  With that in place, then, Slavin is able to take his audience along with Lawrence as his problems gradually begin to unfold.  By so doing, he effectively illustrates how the problem evolves, rather than merely stating the problem and addressing it head on, which heightens the viewers emotional involvement, and ultimately enhances the impact of the film.Slavin makes an important statement with this film, which is not only an indictment of bigotry, but carries a cautionary message about apathy, as well.  And to his credit, he never hits you over the head with it or engages in subjective finger-pointing to make his case; instead, he proceeds carefully, taking great pains to be as objective as possible with all that he is submitting for your consideration.  His approach is that of a cinematic diplomat; and it's an approach that serves Slavin-- and his film-- quite well.As Lawrence, William H. Macy-- one of the best character actors in the business-- gives an amazing performance, establishing the credibility and believability of his character with a sensitive, honest and introspective portrayal.  He never attempts to circumvent the personal flaws of Lawrence's nature, but uses them, instead, to create a character that is decidedly three-dimensional, which not only makes him convincing, but serves to reaffirm the integrity of the portrayal.  What makes it so compelling is Macy's ability to convey the process by which he examines his own conscience, which successfully enables the viewer to share in the experience of his personal epiphany.  In the final analysis, it's the strength of Macy's performance, more than anything else, that makes this film so significantly distinct.Another of the film's strengths is the performance turned in by Laura Dern, as Gertrude Hart, a portrayal that effectively complements Macy's work, as well as that of Slavin.  Dern lends tremendous substance to her character, capturing her physically as well as emotionally, and her colorful zeal crates a striking contrast to Lawrence's reserve that works extremely well, for her character as well as the film itself.And just as Sean Combs recently (in ""Monster's Ball"") made a good case against dismissing out-of-hand the acting endeavors of an established ""rock star,"" Meat Loaf Aday gives a powerful performance here, as Fred, Lawrence's next-door neighbor.  It demonstrates, too, that a true artist will produce, regardless of the kind of canvas he's given to work with.The supporting cast includes Michael Copeman (Carlson), Kenneth Welsh (Father Crighton), Joseph Ziegler (Gargan) and Arlene Meadows (Mrs. Dewitt).  The kind of film that makes a filmmaker proud of his craft, ""Focus,"" offers a memorable experience that hopefully will prove to be enlightening, as well, to those unaware that such conditions have existed, and still do-- even in this, the land of the free.",5,Exceptional Work by Macy,1026432000,"07 12, 2002",2002,6203,"['question', 'film', 'powerful', 'medium', 'more', 'so', 'now', 'ever',

To try to avoid being lumped in with them.  When this doesn't work, he has to make a tougher decision.

It appears to address anti-Semitism.I think it goes much farther in speaking directly to the blind eye of non-participation; to the forces that perpetuate injustice.It's also an exceptionally beautiful film that joins moments of intense, personal experience into a rare example of the high art of teaching history minimally to repeat offenders.",5,"So long as I don't  see injustice, I am injustice",1184371200,"07 14, 2007",2007,391,"['amazing', 'jewel', 'motion', 'picture', 'address', 'anti-Semitism.I', 'think', 'much', 'farther', 'speaking', 'directly', 'blind', 'eye', 'non-participation', 'forces', 'perpetuate', 'injustice.It', 'also', 'exceptionally', 'beautiful', 'film', 'moments', 'intense', 'personal', 'experience', 'rare', 'example', 'high', 'art', 'teaching', 'history', 'minimally', 'repeat', 'offenders']",N/A

Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[5, 5]","Near the end of World War II a middle aged Brooklyn man wakes from a nightmare, looks out his window and sees a neighbor beating and raping a young woman who we learn dies of her injuries while her attacker goes unidentified and unpunished.  So begins FOCUS a film with a great message that is not as subtle as it could be in delivering it.  The man at the window is Lawrence Newman a respectable middle aged bachelor who lives in a tidy home with his invalid mother.  Newman (William H Macy) works as a personnel manager for a firm and his bosses feel he needs glasses.  The premise of the movie is once he begins wearing these glasses (in quite an unsubtle touch the glasses make him see the prejudice around him that he had been blind to before) this Anglo Saxon Protestant suddenly is mistaken as Jewish and a series of persecutions begin for him including  his demotion at work that leads to his resignation, his difficulty finding a new position and garbage being strewn around his yard.Lawrence eventually finds work at a ""Jewish"" firm and is ironically recommended for the position by Gertrude a young woman he had denied employment to because he thought she was Jewish.  Gertrude is played by Laura Dern and like Macy has no physical characteristics usually associated with Jewish ancestry.  Though Gertrude denies it the film seems to hint that she may in fact be hiding her heritage though that is left ambiguous by the script.  Gert and Lawrence fall in love and marry and have a brief period of happiness.  Yet prejudice is alive and well in their neighborhood and led by their next door neighbor Fred, very well played by 70's rock icon Meat Loaf.Macy, Dern and Meat Loaf are all excellent in their parts as are the supporting actors.  The message of the movie is undeniably important but the execution is a bit heavy handed and I wish the filmmakers had respected the intelligence of their audience and their ability to ""connect the dots"" about what is being conveyed in this film.",4,The Nightmare of Prejudice,1210636800,"05 13, 2008",2008,1996,"['end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'middle', 'aged', 'Brooklyn', 'man', 'nightmare', 'out', 'window', 'neighbor', 'beating', 'raping', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'learn', 'dies', 'injuries', 'attacker', 'unidentified', 'unpunished', 'So', 'FOCUS', 'film', 'great', 'message', 'not', 'as', 'subtle', 'could', 'be', 'delivering', 'man', 'window', 'Lawrence', 'Newman', 'respectable', 'middle', 'aged', 'bachelor', 'who', 'tidy', 'home', 'invalid', 'mother', 'Newman', 'William', 'H', 'Macy', 'personnel', 'manager', 'firm', 'bosses', 'feel', 'glasses', 'premise', 'movie', 'once', 'wearing', 'glasses', 'quite', 'unsubtle', 'touch', 'glasses', 'make', 'see', 'prejudice', 'had', 'been', 'blind', 'before', 'Anglo', 'Saxon', 'Protestant', 'suddenly', 'mistaken', 'Jewish', 'series', 'persecutions', 'begin', 'including', 'demotion', 'work', 'resignation', 'difficulty', 'finding', 'new', 'position', 'garbage', 'being', 'strewn', 'yard.Lawrence', 'eventually', 'work', 'Jewish', 'firm', 'ironically', 'recommended', 'position', 'Gertrude', 'young', 'woman', 'had', 'denied', 'employment', 'thought', 'was', 'Jewish', 'Gertrude', 'played', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'Macy', 'physical', 'characteristics', 'usually', 'associated', 'Jewish', 'ancestry', 'Gertrude', 'film', 'hint', 'may', 'fact', 'be', 'hiding', 'heritage', 'left', 'ambiguous', 'script', 'Gert', 'Lawrence', 'fall', 'love', 'marry', 'have', 'brief', 'period', 'happiness', 'prejudice', 'alive', 'well', 'neighborhood', 'led', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Fred', 'very', 'well', 'played', '70', 'rock', 'icon', 'Meat', 'Loaf.Macy', 'Dern', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'are', 'excellent', 'parts', 'are', 'supporting', 'actors', 'message', 'movie', 'undeniably', 'important', 'execution', 'bit', 'heavy', 'handed', 'wish', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'respected', 'intelligence', 'audience', 'ability', 'connect', 'dots', 'what', 'being', 'conveyed', 'film']",N/A
