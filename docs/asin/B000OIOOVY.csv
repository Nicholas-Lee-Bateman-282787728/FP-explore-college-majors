1064398,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B000OIOOVY,A. Burchfield,"[1, 3]","I saw most of these episodes on BBC America last year and bought the PAL region 2 version at Amazon.uk because I didn't think Hex was ever going to show up here in the U.S. The series has a lot of style and even some good writing, particularly in the earlier episodes, but I never got a sense of Buffy or anything like that in watching it. Why the U.S. edition has the episodes as shown on BBC America and not as in the UK DVD set, I don't know but at least you get all of the extras here.As some here have stated you'll actually be getting part of season 2 for your money- the first four hours of it I think- and most of the best episodes of both seasons. I still haven't watched the 2 hour pilot of season 1 but found that season 2 falls off rapidly in writing quality after the ""Ella Burns"" episode which I think will be the last of the set here.It will be worth a look if you haven't seen it but I'm not sure that buying a region 1 set will be worth the money if, as so many of us do,you already own the region 2 sets. I'm going to wait and see just what you get on the season 2 American edition before I even consider buying it because there will be only 9 episodes in that set and if it's done like the British edition- no extras of any sort.",3,"A lot of style, some good stuff- but no ""Buffy"" to it",1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,1248,"['saw', 'most', 'episodes', 'BBC', 'America', 'last', 'year', 'bought', 'PAL', 'region', '2', 'version', 'Amazon.uk', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Hex', 'was', 'ever', 'going', 'show', 'up', 'here', 'U.S', 'series', 'lot', 'style', 'even', 'good', 'writing', 'particularly', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'never', 'got', 'sense', 'Buffy', 'anything', 'watching', 'Why', 'U.S.', 'edition', 'episodes', 'shown', 'BBC', 'America', 'not', 'UK', 'DVD', 'set', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'least', 'get', 'extras', 'here.As', 'here', 'have', 'stated', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'be', 'getting', 'part', 'season', '2', 'money-', 'first', 'four', 'hours', 'think-', 'most', 'best', 'episodes', 'seasons', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', '2', 'hour', 'pilot', 'season', '1', 'found', 'season', '2', 'off', 'rapidly', 'writing', 'quality', 'Ella', 'Burns', 'episode', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'set', 'here.It', 'will', 'be', 'look', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'buying', 'region', '1', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'money', 'so', 'many', 'do', 'already', 'own', 'region', '2', 'sets', ""'m"", 'going', 'wait', 'see', 'just', 'what', 'get', 'season', '2', 'American', 'edition', 'even', 'consider', 'buying', 'will', 'be', 'only', '9', 'episodes', 'set', 'done', 'British', 'edition-', 'extras', 'sort']",N/A
1064399,A3SJ2VSCHZB18,B000OIOOVY,Brian Markowski,"[4, 6]","Cassie, a slightly withdrawn, teenage girl begins to have a series of nightmares after finding an odd shaped urn in the basement of her British prep school Medenham Hall. She also begins to develop odd powers allowing her to move things with her mind and to make matters worst she seems to have attracted a mysterious stranger who may have a serious connection to both the urn and her dreams. So begins the first two episodes of ""Hex"", a U.K. import that has recently run here in the states on BBC America. The show seems inspired by the American Buffy and Angel series, but Hex takes itself far more seriously than the fun and campy Joss Whedon shows, and that's a bad thing.It's slightly unfair to compare the Buffy shows to Hex. Hex desperately tries to carve out it's own notch in the televised genre of the dark arts and in reality it feels more like ""Dark Shadows"" than ""Vampire Slayer"", but more humor and more reason wouldn't have hurt this show in the long run. For instance, as the death toll rises at Medenham Hall there seems to be little logic in how the characters respond. No one seems to think that it's a serious problem that students are found stabbed, attacked by giant creatures or simply go missing. When Cassie speaks to a ghost no one else can see or hear she does so in the classroom or while walking down a hallway filled with students, again no one seems to notice. The series tries to be smart but with giant holes of credibility that go unanswered it's hard to fall under it's spell. The show does have some very good twists and turns that prevents me from going into great detail about the plot beyond episode two without ruining what fun there is for the viewer that might be willing to give this series a chance; but be forwarned, the packaging of this show is confusing.Series 1 of Hex was only six episoes, and it's a sloggish six episodes at best. With episode 7 the show began it's second season and it's obvious to see an infusion of creativity and enhanced production. Credible special effects are added, plots move along faster, and more attempts at humor are made. However the changes are also quite jarring, new characters arrive while others simply vanish with not a word of their whereabouts, also a certain characters's hair and clothes changes quite dramaticlly, which isn't impossible unless your this particular character (again I can't go into detail with spoiling the best parts of the show, sorry). This first set of Hex ends up containing 10 episodes from season 1 and 2. The second set should contain the remaining 9. It makes sense that Sony would package it this way, you get an even amount of shows per set and it  helps to spice up a weaker first season. The irony here is that one of the best things about season one was strong character development, espically with Cassie (thought she does make some god awful choices). Season two seemingly gives up that development for the sake of an ampped up story line. Had the producers found a better way to merge the two, they might have made it to Season 3.",3,A Noble Attempt That Never Quite Finds It's Legs,1196726400,"12 4, 2007",2007,3056,"['Cassie', 'slightly', 'withdrawn', 'teenage', 'girl', 'have', 'series', 'nightmares', 'finding', 'odd', 'shaped', 'urn', 'basement', 'British', 'prep', 'school', 'Medenham', 'Hall', 'also', 'develop', 'odd', 'powers', 'allowing', 'move', 'things', 'mind', 'make', 'matters', 'worst', 'have', 'attracted', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'serious', 'connection', 'urn', 'dreams', 'So', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'Hex', 'U.K.', 'import', 'recently', 'run', 'here', 'states', 'BBC', 'America', 'show', 'inspired', 'American', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'series', 'Hex', 'far', 'more', 'seriously', 'fun', 'campy', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'shows', 'bad', 'thing.It', 'slightly', 'unfair', 'compare', 'Buffy', 'Hex', 'Hex', 'desperately', 'carve', 'out', 'own', 'notch', 'televised', 'genre', 'dark', 'arts', 'reality', 'more', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'more', 'humor', 'more', 'reason', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'hurt', 'show', 'long', 'run', 'instance', 'death', 'toll', 'Medenham', 'Hall', 'there', 'be', 'little', 'logic', 'how', 'characters', 'respond', 'one', 'think', 'serious', 'problem', 'students', 'are', 'found', 'stabbed', 'attacked', 'giant', 'creatures', 'simply', 'go', 'missing', 'When', 'Cassie', 'ghost', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'see', 'hear', 'so', 'classroom', 'walking', 'down', 'hallway', 'filled', 'students', 'again', 'one', 'notice', 'series', 'be', 'smart', 'giant', 'holes', 'credibility', 'go', 'unanswered', 'hard', 'fall', 'spell', 'show', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'twists', 'prevents', 'going', 'great', 'detail', 'plot', 'episode', 'two', 'ruining', 'what', 'fun', 'viewer', 'might', 'be', 'willing', 'give', 'series', 'chance', 'be', 'forwarned', 'packaging', 'show', 'confusing.Series', '1', 'Hex', 'was', 'only', 'six', 'episoes', 'sloggish', 'six', 'episodes', 'best', 'episode', '7', 'show', 'began', 'second', 'season', 'obvious', 'see', 'infusion', 'creativity', 'enhanced', 'production', 'Credible', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'added', 'plots', 'move', 'along', 'faster', 'more', 'attempts', 'humor', 'are', 'made', 'However', 'changes', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'jarring', 'new', 'characters', 'arrive', 'others', 'simply', 'vanish', 'not', 'word', 'whereabouts', 'also', 'certain', 'characters', 'hair', 'clothes', 'changes', 'quite', 'dramaticlly', ""n't"", 'impossible', 'particular', 'character', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'spoiling', 'best', 'parts', 'show', 'sorry', 'first', 'set', 'Hex', 'up', 'containing', '10', 'episodes', 'season', '1', '2', 'second', 'set', 'should', 'contain', 'remaining', '9', 'sense', 'Sony', 'would', 'package', 'way', 'get', 'even', 'amount', 'shows', 'set', 'spice', 'up', 'weaker', 'first', 'season', 'irony', 'here', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'strong', 'character', 'development', 'espically', 'Cassie', 'thought', 'make', 'god', 'awful', 'choices', 'Season', 'two', 'seemingly', 'up', 'development', 'sake', 'ampped', 'up', 'story', 'line', 'Had', 'producers', 'found', 'better', 'way', 'merge', 'two', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'Season', '3']",N/A

I couldn't have said it better myself. Many people are comparing it to Buffy, but it really is so much more.  The characters are rich and layered.  The writing is believable. The casting director was spot on in his choice of actors for the roles.  Azazeal is sexy and endearing, but you always know he's evil through and through, while Cassy is sweet and sassy, with a strength of character that any good heroine must have. Thelma is a treasure to get to know and love.  The fact that she's a lesbian and madly longing for romance with her best friend Cassy is secondary to how much she actually proves the depth of true love as the series grows. I must say that I hate the way the first season ends- with so much left up in the air and dangling.  Thank God they made a second season.  It seems they canceled the series at the end of season 2.  Too bad that we have fallen in love with these characters only to have to say goodbye to them. It seems the pattern of most great shows on television these days.

I was finally able to catch the first 7 episodes here in the states on BBC America & I was disapointed. The idea was there, even if it was ripped off from Anne Rice & her Mayfair witches, even the atmousphere and setting was pretty decent, and no one can really speak badly of Thelma. However I am a true fan of this genre and I have been spoiled by the high quality of the X-files and Buffy the vampire slayer. After experincing what Chris Carter and Joss Wheden have given the world in paranormal storytelling I am appalled that this dreck could so easily satisfy so many. Hex is awful!The character's are not particularly interesting or sympathetic due to a severe lack of development - this blame can go on the writer's. It shouldn't be a welcome relief when a main character ""bites it"", as we say over here, however when Ella sticks it to Cassie we find ourselves really applauding a situation for the very first time in this show - SEVEN EPISODES IN!This show left me bored and unimpressed, Thank God it only took two episodes of x-file reruns to make me forget most of this.

I watch BBCAmerica, and the Brits--they are the leaders of urbane and upscale entertainment.  If you need any convincing, just watch an episode of ""Footballer's Wives,"" ""Mile High,"" or ""Bad Girls.""  Of course, I'm kidding.  These shows are brassy, bawdy, and loaded with bad behavior!  But, you know what, they are also filled with life.  They embrace their nastiness wholeheartedly and make no apologies for being pure popcorn entertainment.  With language and nudity not permitted by American networks, it seems as if the genre of nighttime soaps has been revitalized by Britain.  But that's not all BBCAmerica has to offer, they are just the shows that helped the network grow in popularity.  Some other intriguing entries that recently aired in the US are on their way to DVD--there is a new hip take on ""Robin Hood,"" the supernatural ""Hex,"" and the complex crime story ""Conviction.""  So beware!  The British are coming, the British are coming--and it's a good thing!""Hex"" revolves around the story of a boarding school misfit named Cassie, played by Christina Cole.  With mysterious family ties to the estate, Cassie begins to unearth the truth about who (or what) she is.  On accident, she discovers that she has supernatural powers--she is, in fact, a witch.  Coming to terms with her ancestry, dealing with present dangers, and trying to cope with her new powers--Cassie tries to balance it all with being a regular student who just wants to be accepted and loved.  It doesn't help matters that she is inextricably linked with a fallen angel named Azazeal (who is both a threat and a possible romantic interest) and her best friend is a libidinous lesbian spirit named Thelma.  It seems as if Cassie's fate has been preordained by powers outside of her control.Those expecting a rollicking adventure might be disappointed by the methodical pacing (especially in the beginning).  There is a surprising amount of time spent on character development--we stay with Cassie as she slowly starts to understand what is happening.  Cole plays the role nicely, her transformation is all the more special because it is understated.  Michael Fassbinder brings an ambiguous intensity to the part of Azazeal--it's hard to gage his true intent and that adds appreciated complexity.  And Jemima Rooper, as Thelma, is fresh and funny.  As the obvious comedic relief, she is refreshingly sardonic and almost predatory in her sexuality.  But as nicely as these three embody their roles, there is a large supporting cast at the school that remain rather vaguely defined.While ""Hex"" is definitely an enjoyable show, there always seems to be some element that keeps it from attaining greatness.  I will say that Cassie's evolution and character growth is exceedingly well done--it's appropriately dark when necessary and has real emotional resonance.  The show, however, has a complicated mythology that is never particularly well developed.  I wanted to get caught up in this world and yet that happened only sporadically.  ""Hex"" is at its best when dealing with the primary characters--and the three provide some riveting moments.

1064409,A1LJZWBVCB44RO,B000OIOOVY,"K. Sullivan ""No accounting for taste...""","[4, 5]","I was turned on to this series by some favorable comparisons to Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Those comparisons are ill-made in my opinion and create expectations that likely will go unmet.Whereas this series does have supernatural elements (angels, demons, and witches) and a mythological foundation (a biblical context), the similarities really stop there.  In fairness, this 10 episode set almost feels like two different series.  The first 7 episodes create the stage for the final 3 which are quite different.  Set in a private British boarding school, our leading lady, Cassie, seems an intelligent, shy, well-meaning young lass.  We are told she yearns to be part of the popular crowd (who are stereotypically good at sports, pretty, petty, and back-stabbing).  Apart from desiring the main young stud at the school, however, I did not get a sense she actually wanted to be a part of their group.  We also meet her lesbian wise-cracking roommate (Thelma - a little annoying at first, but progressively funnier as the series unfolds), the popular crowd, and various faculty members.  We are also introduced to Azazeal, a fallen angel whose motivations and true character are a mystery to me still.  We get flashbacks of the school when it was a private manor.  We learn there were some dark goings on which will link to the present.  The central story over the first seven episodes is that Cassie is or becomes a witch (who almost never uses this power) and that Azazeal pursues a relationship with her which he would like to culminate in the birth of a son.These seven episodes are the primary source of frustration.  Nothing is told the viewer outright.  It is excruciatingly slow to develop.  The characters' actions in light of what we see and are told seem incredibly inconsistent or questionable.  If Cassie is a witch, why not fight any potential power of darkness?  If someone harms one's friend, would one cozy up to him almost immediately thereafter?  Would one not at least demand answers?  It is just incomprehensible to me that things could have played out the way they did.In episode 8 or so, we are introduced to a new character, Ella.  This is where the slayer comparison is more well-founded.  Though we only get to know her over the last three episodes, she appears to be called to fight the fallen angels or at least to thwart their schemes to release their brethren.  She has special weapons and demonstrates an ability to kick some butt (unlike Cassie).  Though the first seven episodes set the stage (ever so slowly) for the final three, it is almost like a new show - in fairness, probably a better show with some promise.The series is thoroughly British utilizing their unique idiom and is considerably more risqu&eacute; than an American series would be.  The production is quite good and many of the special effects are top-notch (the Nephilim or fallen angels or children of God are very well-done, whereas the use of bloodshot eyes to signify possession was a bit second-rate).  It seems the set is too barren at times particularly early when we focus on Cassie and her love interests.  I found myself wondering where everyone else was.The material is full of potential, but it did not materialize in season one.  I wrestled with a two or three-star rating.  Despite all the problems I had with the show, the final episode had me literally on the edge of my seat.  That is a special ability.  But there was just too much frustrating about the season to rate it positively.  To be fair, it did leave me with the desire to check out season two when it is available.",2,Extremely frustrating series with wonderful potential,1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,3594,"['was', 'turned', 'series', 'favorable', 'comparisons', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'comparisons', 'are', 'ill-made', 'opinion', 'create', 'expectations', 'likely', 'will', 'go', 'unmet.Whereas', 'series', 'have', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'angels', 'demons', 'witches', 'mythological', 'foundation', 'biblical', 'context', 'similarities', 'really', 'stop', 'there', 'fairness', '10', 'episode', 'set', 'almost', 'feels', 'two', 'different', 'series', 'first', '7', 'episodes', 'create', 'stage', 'final', '3', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'Set', 'private', 'British', 'boarding', 'school', 'leading', 'lady', 'Cassie', 'intelligent', 'shy', 'well-meaning', 'young', 'lass', 'are', 'told', 'be', 'part', 'popular', 'crowd', 'who', 'are', 'stereotypically', 'good', 'sports', 'pretty', 'petty', 'back-stabbing', 'Apart', 'desiring', 'main', 'young', 'stud', 'school', 'however', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'sense', 'actually', 'wanted', 'be', 'part', 'group', 'also', 'meet', 'lesbian', 'wise-cracking', 'roommate', 'Thelma', 'little', 'annoying', 'first', 'progressively', 'funnier', 'series', 'unfolds', 'popular', 'crowd', 'various', 'faculty', 'members', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'Azazeal', 'fallen', 'angel', 'motivations', 'true', 'character', 'are', 'mystery', 'still', 'get', 'flashbacks', 'school', 'when', 'was', 'private', 'manor', 'learn', 'were', 'dark', 'goings', 'will', 'link', 'present', 'central', 'story', 'first', 'seven', 'episodes', 'Cassie', 'witch', 'who', 'almost', 'never', 'power', 'Azazeal', 'relationship', 'would', 'like', 'culminate', 'birth', 'son.These', 'seven', 'episodes', 'are', 'primary', 'source', 'frustration', 'Nothing', 'told', 'viewer', 'outright', 'excruciatingly', 'slow', 'develop', 'characters', 'actions', 'light', 'what', 'see', 'are', 'told', 'seem', 'incredibly', 'inconsistent', 'questionable', 'Cassie', 'witch', 'why', 'not', 'fight', 'potential', 'power', 'darkness', 'someone', 'one', 'friend', 'would', 'one', 'cozy', 'almost', 'immediately', 'thereafter', 'Would', 'one', 'not', 'least', 'demand', 'answers', 'just', 'incomprehensible', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'out', 'way', 'did.In', 'episode', '8', 'so', 'are', 'introduced', 'new', 'character', 'Ella', 'where', 'slayer', 'comparison', 'more', 'well-founded', 'only', 'get', 'know', 'last', 'three', 'episodes', 'be', 'called', 'fight', 'fallen', 'angels', 'least', 'thwart', 'schemes', 'release', 'brethren', 'special', 'weapons', 'ability', 'kick', 'butt', 'Cassie', 'first', 'seven', 'episodes', 'set', 'stage', 'ever', 'so', 'slowly', 'final', 'three', 'almost', 'new', 'show', 'fairness', 'probably', 'better', 'show', 'promise.The', 'series', 'thoroughly', 'British', 'utilizing', 'unique', 'idiom', 'considerably', 'more', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'American', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'production', 'quite', 'good', 'many', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'top-notch', 'Nephilim', 'fallen', 'angels', 'children', 'God', 'are', 'very', 'well-done', 'use', 'bloodshot', 'eyes', 'signify', 'possession', 'was', 'bit', 'second-rate', 'set', 'too', 'barren', 'times', 'particularly', 'early', 'when', 'focus', 'Cassie', 'love', 'interests', 'found', 'wondering', 'where', 'everyone', 'else', 'was.The', 'material', 'full', 'potential', 'did', 'not', 'materialize', 'season', 'one', 'wrestled', 'two', 'three-star', 'rating', 'problems', 'had', 'show', 'final', 'episode', 'had', 'literally', 'edge', 'seat', 'special', 'ability', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'frustrating', 'season', 'rate', 'positively', 'be', 'fair', 'did', 'leave', 'desire', 'check', 'out', 'season', 'two', 'when', 'available']",N/A

There were scenes that were downright spooky.This series worked for a few reasons: (1) great character development; (2) great acting; (3) even though the plot was fantastic (fallen angels and witches), they set up a mythology that made it all work; and (4) great dialogue. The main characters of Cassie with her demure shyness and Thelma with her brass (fill-in-the-blank) are a perfect pairing.  Azazeal is the requisite brooding dark male with loads of sex appeal. These three have some of the best dialogues I've heard in a while. The supporting cast is really good too. Leon (resident jerk), Troy (greek god on campus) and the Headmaster are stellar. Also, the whole mythology was well crafted and they stayed true throughout. Lastly, the dialogue contained within these six episodes are almost Whedon-like (although not a Buffy clone and should not be compared - two very different animals) in their beauty. Characeters provided great lines that never get tired (especially Thelma).I subtracted one star for two reasons.  A huge problem I had with this dvd set is that this version has been cut and edited for American tv and sometimes it did effect the show's arc.  I treasure my Region 2 version straight from the UK.  Also, I had an issue with ""possession"" as in one case it was physically painful (random guy in bar who flirts w/Cassie) and in the other was so peaceful it happened while asleep (Troy). This did not detract from the overall experience.As for extras, this set contains deleted scenes (very interesting), commentary by director Brian Grant for the 1st & 2nd episodes and a behind the scenes look. I highly recommend this series. It is very entertaining and stands up well under repeated viewings.

1064414,ARMVAHWQQ9S8A,B000OIOOVY,"Pat Shand ""Pat Shand""","[2, 3]","""Hex"" is noBuffy The Vampire Slayeras some reviewers proclaim... but it defintely shoots for the tone of Joss Whedon's vampire slaying epic.  At its best, ""Hex"" is an entertaining gothic horror/dramedy that has a similar mood to the second season ofBuffy.  There is consistent humor, a good amount of horror that concentrates more on plot development than scares, and some clever metaphors (and some more straight forward stuff) about sexual awakening.  It's tragic, at times moving, at times funny, but never really goes to that next level.  While ""Hex"" is a good supernatural drama, it fails from becoming great due to several complications.The storytelling at the beginning of the series is rather uneven.  Thelma, the best friend of our protagonist Cassie, is killed by the villainous Azazeal in the first episode... and comes back as a ghost before Cassie is even given a chance to mourn.  Fine, and it gives ample opportunites for some truly tragic stuff, because Thelma is also in love with Cassie.  But the thing is, neither of the characters question why Thelma is a ghost, and a reason is only explained way down the line when the plot calls for it.  It makes for a lot of ""okay... what?"" moments, but the worst thing was the logic behind the central mythology of the show.  They handle a ""fallen angel"" plot nicely, making the Apocryphal being Azazeal the villain, but what they handle without grace is the logistics of the way ghosts interact with the world.  Thelma, the ghost, can eat, touch things, move things... the only thing she can't do is touch living flesh.  This does cause a lot of emotional scenes, but it's bad plotting because the writers threw logic out of the window for the purpose of having Thelma be funny while eating.  A lot of strange moments like this are sprinkled throughout ""Hex,"" but none are as great as the ghost predicament.The characters, however, are great.  I love Cassie as the protagnonist, but also thought the show--which was a lot better in the last few episodes of the season, was able to seamlessly shift to having Thelma and newcomer Ella as de facto protagonists.  Thelma is fantastic, both for the humor and drama, and I'll undoubtedly be following Jemima Rooper's career in the future.  Azazeal is also a fantastic character, playing the role of a sympathetic villain who will shed a tear as he does dastardly deeds.  The supporting cast, from the headmaster David to Leon and the rest of his snarky crew, also help to make this show a thoroughly enjoying experience.While the show has some pretty large flaws, most of them are early on, and the fact that there is a lot of heart, effort, and ambition in both the writing and the acting is very apparent, and it translated through to the viewers.  I don't think it's a classic show, but I would definitely buy the second season if they ever decide to release it in the USA, because I'm not sure I've had enough of the ""Hex"" crew.7/10",4,Hoping They Release the Second Season Soon,1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,2940,"['Hex', 'Vampire', 'Slayeras', 'reviewers', 'proclaim', 'defintely', 'tone', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'vampire', 'slaying', 'epic', 'best', 'Hex', 'entertaining', 'gothic', 'horror/dramedy', 'similar', 'mood', 'second', 'season', 'ofBuffy', 'consistent', 'humor', 'good', 'amount', 'horror', 'more', 'plot', 'development', 'scares', 'clever', 'metaphors', 'more', 'straight', 'forward', 'stuff', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'tragic', 'times', 'moving', 'times', 'funny', 'never', 'really', 'next', 'level', 'Hex', 'good', 'supernatural', 'drama', 'becoming', 'great', 'due', 'several', 'complications.The', 'storytelling', 'beginning', 'series', 'rather', 'uneven', 'Thelma', 'best', 'friend', 'protagonist', 'Cassie', 'killed', 'villainous', 'Azazeal', 'first', 'episode', 'back', 'ghost', 'Cassie', 'even', 'given', 'chance', 'mourn', 'Fine', 'ample', 'opportunites', 'truly', 'tragic', 'stuff', 'Thelma', 'also', 'love', 'Cassie', 'thing', 'characters', 'question', 'why', 'Thelma', 'ghost', 'reason', 'only', 'explained', 'way', 'line', 'when', 'plot', 'lot', 'okay', 'what', 'moments', 'worst', 'thing', 'was', 'logic', 'central', 'mythology', 'show', 'handle', 'fallen', 'angel', 'plot', 'nicely', 'making', 'Apocryphal', 'being', 'Azazeal', 'villain', 'what', 'handle', 'grace', 'logistics', 'way', 'ghosts', 'interact', 'world', 'Thelma', 'ghost', 'can', 'eat', 'touch', 'things', 'move', 'things', 'only', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'touch', 'living', 'flesh', 'cause', 'lot', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'bad', 'plotting', 'writers', 'threw', 'logic', 'window', 'purpose', 'having', 'Thelma', 'be', 'funny', 'eating', 'lot', 'strange', 'moments', 'are', 'sprinkled', 'Hex', 'none', 'are', 'as', 'great', 'ghost', 'predicament.The', 'characters', 'however', 'are', 'great', 'love', 'Cassie', 'protagnonist', 'also', 'thought', 'show', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'season', 'was', 'able', 'seamlessly', 'shift', 'having', 'Thelma', 'newcomer', 'Ella', 'de', 'facto', 'protagonists', 'Thelma', 'fantastic', 'humor', 'drama', ""'ll"", 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'following', 'Jemima', 'Rooper', 'career', 'future', 'Azazeal', 'also', 'fantastic', 'character', 'playing', 'role', 'sympathetic', 'villain', 'who', 'will', 'shed', 'tear', 'dastardly', 'deeds', 'supporting', 'cast', 'headmaster', 'David', 'Leon', 'rest', 'snarky', 'crew', 'also', 'help', 'make', 'show', 'thoroughly', 'enjoying', 'show', 'pretty', 'large', 'flaws', 'most', 'are', 'early', 'fact', 'lot', 'heart', 'effort', 'ambition', 'writing', 'acting', 'very', 'apparent', 'translated', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'classic', 'show', 'would', 'definitely', 'buy', 'second', 'season', 'ever', 'decide', 'release', 'USA', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'had', 'enough', 'Hex', 'crew.7/10']",N/A

Just as the show was building momentum, they killed off the main character!!! What were they thinking??? The answer is, they weren't. So they bring in a new actress to replace the lead as a different character. Okay, can you say, Who cares? This leads to the last three episodes of season one, ending in a witch trial that (though likely an accurate depiction of the past) is unnecessarily gruesome.

BBC America showed last season and this season out of order, so I sat down one day and watched episodes 1 to 8. I plan to watch episodes 9, 10 and the deleted scenes real soon. I am now even more hooked than ever. I am waiting for Season 2 in region 1 NTSC format and I hope they make a Season 3, 4, etc. You can not compare this to Buffy because it is very different story. The only similarity is that they are both about the supernatural. I liked the Buffy series, but this series is better than Buffy, Angel, or Xena. Hooray for the British.

1064421,A3DI1ZY8MNEAR5,B000OIOOVY,Tom,"[0, 2]","One member said this was a British ""Buffy"". I agree. It has the same feel that ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" carried through season 3-6. A fallen angel, Azazael, terrorizes a girl, Cassie, and the only friend she has is her dead roommate, Thelma, played by Jemima Rooper. There are some clips of Cassie and Thelma on youtube. I wanted to see what the first season was like before I even thought of buying it. I eventually found it on aoltv and I was impressed.Thelma is a lesbian ghost who can enter into peoples thoughts. Cassie is the only one who can see her. She's still able to eat things and pay tolls. Kind of throws off the whole ghost thing but, hey, if it works. She's in love with Cassie and she's not ashamed of letting it known. She gets sacrificed at the second part of the pilot. I'll only say that how it happens really is lovely and heartbreaking.Cassie finds an urn and immediately gets stalked by the fallen angel, Azazael, who should've been played by Julian McMahon (Cole) from ""Charmed"". That's just how I feel. Julian really does still have that thing working for him. Cassie slowly falls victim to Azazael's charms, spiritual and exorcistical. She comes off as a Rose Tyler from ""Doctor Who"" with some Willow from ""Buffy"" in season 4.I don't know if there's a difference between what SkyOne or AolTV put up and what is on the dvd's. But I do know that this is a series that does not deserve to get the chop after 2 stinking seasons.

1064422,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B000OIOOVY,trashcanman,"[60, 66]","This series is not, as it has been billed, a British ""Buffy"" which was more comedic, comic-bookish, and all-around entertaining.  However, ""Hex"" is a fine series in it's own right and it's about darn time we got it in the US.  For those of us with region-free DVD players and/or BBC on their cable service, this series has been quite a treat.  It is smart, funny, creepy, mysterious, and pushed the envelope quite a bit, farther then what's normally considered acceptable on basic cable.  In that respect, it definitely helped that this show flew in way under the radar, but it shouldn't have because it's a great series.  The characters are all nicely fleshed out and endearing in their own way and believe me, this show is not afraid of shaking things up.  The second season is among the most earth-shattering and bold runs of television I've ever seen; unfortunately it also features one of the most disappointing endings imaginable.  But let's focus on what's on the table right now, shall we?  Season one is a fantastic, if slow-paced, introduction and set up for a show that is more than worth your time.  If you're into shows like ""Angel"", ""Supernatural"", and (naturally) ""Buffy"" than this series will scratch your itch in a big way.  Cassie is our tragic (not to mention impossibly beautiful) heroine whose future is forever in suspense after she catches the eye of a devilish man named Azazeal.  Azazeal is your typical emissary of the ultimate evil kind of guy; supernaturally smooth, charming, and ruthless as hell. Cassie's lesbian friend Thelma is among the most loveable and funny characters on any television series and a great example of how a ""sidekick"" can take over a show with sheer charm.  There are plenty of suprises, scares, revelations, and shockers over the course of this series that will keep you guessing from the edge of your seat and watitng for what comes next.  Give it a try and then wonder to yourself why this kind of quality television took years to make it's way to our shores.",4,Filled with potential.,1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,2015,"['series', 'not', 'been', 'billed', 'British', 'Buffy', 'was', 'more', 'comedic', 'comic-bookish', 'all-around', 'entertaining', 'However', 'Hex', 'fine', 'series', 'own', 'right', 'darn', 'time', 'got', 'US', 'region-free', 'DVD', 'players', 'and/or', 'BBC', 'cable', 'service', 'series', 'been', 'quite', 'treat', 'smart', 'funny', 'creepy', 'mysterious', 'pushed', 'envelope', 'quite', 'bit', 'farther', 'then', 'what', 'normally', 'considered', 'acceptable', 'basic', 'cable', 'respect', 'definitely', 'helped', 'show', 'flew', 'way', 'radar', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'great', 'series', 'characters', 'are', 'nicely', 'fleshed', 'out', 'endearing', 'own', 'way', 'believe', 'show', 'not', 'afraid', 'shaking', 'things', 'up', 'second', 'season', 'most', 'earth-shattering', 'bold', 'runs', 'television', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'unfortunately', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'disappointing', 'endings', 'imaginable', 'let', 'focus', 'table', 'right', 'now', 'shall', 'Season', 'one', 'fantastic', 'slow-paced', 'introduction', 'set', 'up', 'show', 'more', 'time', ""'re"", 'shows', 'Angel', 'Supernatural', 'naturally', 'Buffy', 'series', 'will', 'scratch', 'itch', 'big', 'way', 'Cassie', 'tragic', 'not', 'mention', 'impossibly', 'beautiful', 'heroine', 'future', 'forever', 'suspense', 'eye', 'devilish', 'man', 'named', 'Azazeal', 'Azazeal', 'typical', 'emissary', 'ultimate', 'evil', 'kind', 'guy', 'supernaturally', 'smooth', 'charming', 'ruthless', 'hell', 'Cassie', 'lesbian', 'friend', 'Thelma', 'most', 'loveable', 'funny', 'characters', 'television', 'series', 'great', 'example', 'how', 'sidekick', 'can', 'take', 'over', 'show', 'sheer', 'charm', 'are', 'plenty', 'suprises', 'scares', 'revelations', 'shockers', 'course', 'series', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'edge', 'seat', 'watitng', 'what', 'next', 'Give', 'try', 'then', 'wonder', 'yourself', 'why', 'kind', 'quality', 'television', 'took', 'years', 'make', 'way', 'shores']",N/A
