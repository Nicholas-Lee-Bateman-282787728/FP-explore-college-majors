Did this guy want a second mom or a partner for life? I'm not saying younger men and older women are incompatible - but his maturity level would definitely have to factor into the equation. However, I enjoyed the movie. It was funny, very entertaining. There is just something about old-fashioned settings that I adore in movies like this - I guess it is because those values and ideas presented in them are long lost, and we'll never retrieve them, except thru this avenue.

The story takes place during the 1940s in Harlem, NY.  Rashad's character is trying to adjust to the fast-paced life in NYC and falls in love with a younger man.

665615,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,B00005MIUW,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[23, 23]","I first caught ""The Old Settler"" on TV several years back and enjoyed this comedy-drama thoroughly. I was thrilled to find out it was available on home video. Starring one of my favorite actresses, the beautiful Phylicia Rashad and her equally talented sister, Debbie Allen (who directed), ""The Old Settler"" is the story of a Harlem spinster in her late 40s-early 50s  (Rashad) who sees a last chance at love and marriage when she meets a younger man in his early 20s named Husband (Bumper Robinson), fresh from the country, who becomes their houseguest during World War II. The spinster Elizabeth and Husband hit it off as friends right away, but soon the situation evolves into something more. At first, Elizabeth is reluctant to get involved with the young man, but Husband's charm wins her over. However, there are several folks out there who are frowning upon their relationship, and they refer to Elizabeth as an ""old settler""...a popular term in the 1940s for an older woman who has never been married and has zero prospects for such.Debbie Allen plays Rashad's skeptical divorced younger sister, Quilly, who doesn't trust Husband and disapproves of her sister's behavior when it comes to him. However, when you hear the possible reason why Elizabeth was still single at her age, you dislike Quilly somewhat and are rooting for Elizabeth and Husband to make it as a couple. But by the time the film ends, Quilly redeems herself. Plus Husband has baggage of his own: his ex, a woman his own age (Crystal R. Fox). Since moving to Harlem, she has gone from being a quiet country girl to a worldly woman who loves the nightlife. She can seemingly control Husband with an action or a word. She proves to be the catalyst in this May-December love story.Without revealing too much more of the movie, ""The Old Settler"" proves one again that Phylicia and Debbie working together make an excellent team. Debbie is especially humorous...her little quips had me laughing. I highly recommend this film, and it IS available on DVD...you just have to hunt for it!

The acting by the sisters,(Allen and Rashad) were nothing short of outstanding. My only thing is at the end, I wasn't sure whether or not Husband was reluctant to meet up or if Ms Rashad's character changed her mind. I like to feel that the military probably caught up with him and took him.After all, it was during the Second World War, and not many were exempt from service. That was my only concern. Other than that, I loved it. My other problem is the fact that back in the day, ladies that never married were treated real bad and called ""settlers"". I felt that was real disrespectful. I was so glad though to see a young brother fall for Ms Rashad's character, and was applauding it all the way. I am so glad that it don't apply today.
