The plot is actually better than some so called serious movies, if you accept intelligent dogs &amp; cats, kids especially should like it. The cat's world domination plan was almost like something out of a 007 movie, the lead cat looked like the cat one of Bond's enemies used to have, even the gadgetry was mostly good. There appeared to be more animatronic cat work than for the dogs this and the computer altered facial expressions seemed less successful on the cats. This and the dog headquarters and transport system were the weakest points for me, that and a little violence.

671839,AT2J7H5TRZM8Z,B00005O5DJ,A Customer,"[2, 5]","Sneak Peak - The PlotThe movie opens up with what else - innocently - a dog chasing a cat. Up and down, in and out, all around, we watch as the dog and cat toy with each other. Seems like a normal day in Kansas, right Dorothy? Ahem. Not at all. We're about to enter the Double Secret Covert Operation of Cats and Dogs.You see, ever since the beginning of time, cats and dogs have wagered war against each other. Dogs, as man's best friend, have protected the interest of humans while cats just want to rule the world.A power hungry persian cat, Mr. Tinkles (Sean Hayes), gets a little greedy and decides that it's time to dominate the world. There's just a small problem. A scientist - Professor Brody (Jeff Goldblum), is mixing up an antidote to free himself from dog allergies. He is thisclose to succeeding. If more people owned dogs, cats would lose any hopes that they had at being #1.Scott Brody (Alexander Pollock), the owner of the dog that we just watched chase that cat, is sad. His dog is missing. Presumed as a runaway. (But we know - better - he was CATNAPPED!)The dog council, determined to protect both the Brody family and their best interest, work on making sure that the next dog owned by Scott, can adequately protect all of them.Enter the cutest little beagle dog you've seen in a long time. He's in the right place, at the right time. Mrs. Brody (Elizabeth Perkins), looking to replace the dog that she thinks has run away, has her heart stolen by this little pup.The pup named Lou (Tobey Maquire), is brought home and thrown into the adventure. Befriended by the more senior agent dog, Butch (Alec Baldwin), he does his best to aid in saving mankind and protecting his fellow four-legged friends.The GoodWriting: Kudos to Freshman writers John Requa & Glenn Ficarra for coming up with a fresh approach to a good guy/bad guy storyline. Using animals as the main characters in a film, is always a risky thing. The balance between human and animal interaction worked. The humans didn't come across nearly as stupid as they could have been. As a human, I appreciate that ;).Special Effects: I'm not a technical chick but I was very impressed with the special effects of the movie. When a dog or cat was talking, their mouths matched the words. It was amazing! (Yes, it doesn't take much to impress me.) When I looked at the names of the individuals credited for special and visual effects, they have quite a variety of experiences with television, film, and animation. An overlooked crowd with the consumer, we really should remember just how brilliant these people are at pulling off the impossible.Voices: I remember a time when actors thought that being seen was more important than being heard. Thank gawd that it's cool to be in movies like this where only your voice is heard. Tobey McGuire was perfect as the cute adventurous pup, Lou. And to my surprise, Alec Baldwin was fantastic as senior dog dude, Butch. Really Alec, this was MUCH better than Pearl Harbor.Some of the other people who lent their voices were Susan Sarandon, the ever funny Jon Lovitz, and Michael Clarke Duncan.A special note about Sean Hayes. Should the man ever leave the popular Will and Grace I feel confident in saying that he has another life in film. He had oodles of charisma as the evil Mr. Tinkles.The Could Have Been ImprovedEditing: I'm gonna say it here instead of in the writing because me thinks it was probably there in the writing. Two of the characters, Ivy and Butch, have a past that is only hinted at. It gets explored for all of four seconds and then is dropped. Me thinks that this relationship was the result of film hitting the floor in order to cut down the run time.Pacing: My only one major criticism of the movie is that I didn't feel like it moved quickly enough in the beginning. And then towards the end, we seemed to be in overdrive. I understand the importance of leading up with a good, thorough story, I just think Mr. Director (Lawrence Guterman) you could have done it differently and thus better.The EndIt seems like Family Films are suddenly back in style this year. If you've caught Spy Kids and Shrek, most likely, you'll want to see this too.",4,Cats and Dogs - You'll Never Look At Them The Same Again,1035590400,"10 26, 2002",2002,4182,"['Sneak', 'Peak', 'PlotThe', 'movie', 'up', 'what', 'else', 'innocently', 'dog', 'chasing', 'cat', 'Up', 'down', 'around', 'watch', 'dog', 'cat', 'toy', 'other', 'normal', 'day', 'Kansas', 'right', 'Dorothy', 'Ahem', 'Not', ""'re"", 'enter', 'Double', 'Secret', 'Covert', 'Operation', 'Cats', 'Dogs.You', 'see', 'ever', 'beginning', 'time', 'cats', 'dogs', 'have', 'wagered', 'war', 'other', 'Dogs', 'man', 'best', 'friend', 'have', 'protected', 'interest', 'humans', 'cats', 'just', 'want', 'rule', 'world.A', 'power', 'hungry', 'persian', 'cat', 'Mr.', 'Tinkles', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'little', 'greedy', 'time', 'dominate', 'world', 'just', 'small', 'problem', 'scientist', 'Professor', 'Brody', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'mixing', 'up', 'antidote', 'free', 'dog', 'allergies', 'thisclose', 'succeeding', 'more', 'people', 'owned', 'dogs', 'cats', 'would', 'lose', 'hopes', 'had', 'being', '1.Scott', 'Brody', 'Alexander', 'Pollock', 'owner', 'dog', 'just', 'watched', 'chase', 'cat', 'sad', 'dog', 'missing', 'Presumed', 'runaway', 'know', 'better', 'was', 'CATNAPPED', 'dog', 'council', 'determined', 'protect', 'Brody', 'family', 'best', 'interest', 'work', 'making', 'sure', 'next', 'dog', 'owned', 'Scott', 'can', 'adequately', 'protect', 'them.Enter', 'cutest', 'little', 'beagle', 'dog', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'Mrs.', 'Brody', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'looking', 'replace', 'dog', 'run', 'away', 'heart', 'stolen', 'little', 'pup.The', 'pup', 'named', 'Lou', 'Tobey', 'Maquire', 'brought', 'home', 'thrown', 'adventure', 'Befriended', 'more', 'senior', 'agent', 'dog', 'Butch', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'best', 'aid', 'saving', 'mankind', 'protecting', 'fellow', 'four-legged', 'friends.The', 'GoodWriting', 'Kudos', 'Freshman', 'writers', 'John', 'Requa', 'Glenn', 'Ficarra', 'coming', 'up', 'fresh', 'approach', 'good', 'guy/bad', 'guy', 'storyline', 'Using', 'animals', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'always', 'risky', 'thing', 'balance', 'human', 'animal', 'interaction', 'worked', 'humans', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'across', 'nearly', 'as', 'stupid', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'human', 'appreciate', '.Special', 'Effects', ""'m"", 'not', 'technical', 'chick', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'When', 'dog', 'cat', 'was', 'talking', 'mouths', 'matched', 'words', 'was', 'amazing', 'Yes', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'impress', 'When', 'looked', 'names', 'individuals', 'credited', 'special', 'visual', 'effects', 'have', 'quite', 'variety', 'experiences', 'television', 'film', 'animation', 'overlooked', 'crowd', 'consumer', 'really', 'should', 'remember', 'just', 'how', 'brilliant', 'people', 'are', 'pulling', 'off', 'impossible.Voices', 'remember', 'time', 'when', 'actors', 'thought', 'being', 'seen', 'was', 'more', 'important', 'being', 'heard', 'Thank', 'gawd', 'cool', 'be', 'movies', 'where', 'only', 'voice', 'heard', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'was', 'perfect', 'cute', 'adventurous', 'pup', 'Lou', 'surprise', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'was', 'fantastic', 'senior', 'dog', 'dude', 'Butch', 'Really', 'Alec', 'was', 'MUCH', 'better', 'Pearl', 'Harbor.Some', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'lent', 'voices', 'were', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'ever', 'funny', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan.A', 'special', 'note', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'Should', 'man', 'ever', 'leave', 'popular', 'Will', 'Grace', 'feel', 'confident', 'saying', 'life', 'film', 'had', 'oodles', 'charisma', 'evil', 'Mr.', 'Tinkles.The', 'Could', 'Have', 'Been', 'ImprovedEditing', ""'m"", 'gon', 'say', 'here', 'instead', 'writing', 'was', 'probably', 'there', 'writing', 'Two', 'characters', 'Ivy', 'Butch', 'have', 'past', 'only', 'hinted', 'explored', 'four', 'seconds', 'then', 'dropped', 'Me', 'relationship', 'was', 'result', 'film', 'hitting', 'floor', 'order', 'cut', 'down', 'run', 'time.Pacing', 'only', 'one', 'major', 'criticism', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'moved', 'quickly', 'enough', 'beginning', 'then', 'towards', 'end', 'seemed', 'be', 'overdrive', 'understand', 'importance', 'leading', 'up', 'good', 'thorough', 'story', 'just', 'think', 'Mr.', 'Director', 'Lawrence', 'Guterman', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'differently', 'thus', 'better.The', 'EndIt', 'Family', 'Films', 'are', 'suddenly', 'back', 'style', 'year', ""'ve"", 'caught', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'Shrek', 'most', 'likely', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'too']",Cats & Dogs

The story doesn't really matter when you are thoroughly amused by the special effects and the computerized characters in the film. This film was an hour and a half of ridiculous fun and amusement. It would be recommended for everyone who liked Harry Potter, Shrek, and even the matrix.

Who can resist those cats when they purr while rubbing up against your face? And what about man's best friend, when they look at you with those cute, puppy eyes?Of course, that purring and those puppy eyes are all just an act, to hide from us humans the fact that there is a war going on between cats and dogs. The cats want to take over the world, once again forcing humans to submit to their will, while dogs are determined to protect humanity from the evil cats.That, in a nutshell, is the plot of ""Cats & Dogs,"" a sometimes funny, but flawed, look at a battle going on right underneath our clueless noses.Overall, this movie is quite funny and enjoyable to watch. There are several truly hilarious moments (the entire ninja cats sequence is the best) and the voice-overs are great. But the special effects, especially in the beginning of the movie, leave a lot to be desired. There are several spots throughout the movie when you are jarred out of the fantasy of the movie because what you are seeing looks so fake.The DVD version does come with some interesting extras, some of which are different depending on whether you select the dog or cat choice in the beginning.This is probably a movie you will want to rent first before you buy.

I've seen this countless times and still don't mind it.  The story of the hidden war between cats and dogs is a hoot, whether or not you actually prefer one species over the other, and the jokes and one-liners are hysterical.  Like the best cartoons, there are jokes that make the kids laugh and jokes that make the adults laugh.  The voice talent is superb, the human actors are very good (though poor Jeff Goldblum just seems to play himself anymore), the special effects are impressive and each scene works -- from the elaborate opening sequence to ninja cats and a visit to Dog Headquarters.As for this DVD edition, the special features are pretty good.  The film can be heard in English or French with English, French or Spanish subtitles.  There are two featurettes: a 13-minute HBO First Look and a 6-minute special fx review.  You can also compare storyboards of the ninja cat scene to the film, and the commentary track, featuring the director, the producer and the production designer, is very entertaining -- the participants even try to make the case that this movie is ""like The Matrix""!

671850,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005O5DJ,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Cats & Dogs is basically taking the cuteness factor of kittens and puppies and tries making a storyline out of them fighting at war among another... in hyper mode.There's seriously something extremely creepy about this particular animal flick that makes it more like a horror film than any kind of adorable animal-loving family movie.I believe I know what it is.It's the way the animals go from acting completely normal and playful one moment to suddenly (out of nowhere) switching up in a way to try and make the speaking voices fit their moving mouths, making it appear like the dogs and cats are actually talking.  Yes that's right, it's one of THOSE type of animal films.  The kind where the animals move their mouths and actually talk.  It's done a little odder than usual this time around however.Even their eyes look extremely weird the moment a change up occurs- the animals look drugged out of their minds.  It's honestly quite frightening but I suppose the movie producers were going for as much realism as possible concerning a talking animal...Then take into consideration many times you will witness the animals suddenly speed up and act really goofy and uncharacteristic, and folks, we have a horror film belonging in the same category as that old 80's classic, Devil Dog.Take the bloodhound for instance.  He suddenly speeds up and totally screws with my head upon doing so.  Strange.The beagle puppies are of course adorable, and the kittens are as well but neither of these things are enough to win me over.

Only once previoously has my cat, Star, aged eleven years, looked at anything on t.v.  One Sunday she watched all of Sagwa the Chinese Siamese animated show.  But she liked this motley crew of talking dogs as they plodded against felines of her kind.When the hound went around in circles attempting to catch his own tail, I laughed so much she left her favorite chair to console me.  After that, I had to temper my enjoyment of this assorted group who learned of the ancient Egyptian fascination with cats from a book.The cats had no faces, only pug noses and lots of fur -- maybe that is Persian.  They were the strangest looking cats I ever saw, must be Japanese.  Star has a very pretty face and is short-haired.  Some weird alien cats arrived (and left) in kamisake planes to attack the hound dog.  These weird fat cats resided with a comatose factory owner.  Watching them drive his black limo and propel him around wired with several IVs as they gave orders for the workers to abandon the Mason factory, it was quite something.The stray, a greyhound, was evocative to the puzzled hound.  These dogs had decided they were Russian spies.  A conference of dogs takes place  similar to a Russian agency something like our United Nations.  On Canine News Network, we heard Wolf Blitzer heralding a Revolution against the human race.The cats took over the Mason factory and captured the hound's human family as hostages to secure a potion to make humans allergic to dogs.  The leader uses a World Domination booklet to indoctrinate the mice on how to infiltrate the sewers to infect human existence.The dogs save the day and the scientist's family in the midst of a fire.  As the cats maneuver heavy equipment in the factory, the hound jumps through the air like Mighty Mouse to &quot;here to save the day.&quot;  He exits the inferno in falling snow to discover his valuable place in the family.The big fat white cat ends up modeling outlandish outfits made for him by a foursome of sisters in a big house, seemingly a fate worse than death.",3,"A battle to the death, canine style.",1086393600,"06 5, 2004",2004,2154,"['Star', 'watched', 'animal', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'watched', 'cats', 'was', 'riveted', 'talking', 'dogs', 'too', 'Only', 'once', 'previoously', 'cat', 'Star', 'aged', 'eleven', 'years', 'looked', 'anything', 't.v', 'One', 'Sunday', 'watched', 'Sagwa', 'Chinese', 'Siamese', 'animated', 'show', 'liked', 'motley', 'crew', 'talking', 'dogs', 'plodded', 'felines', 'kind.When', 'hound', 'went', 'circles', 'attempting', 'catch', 'own', 'tail', 'laughed', 'so', 'much', 'left', 'favorite', 'chair', 'console', 'had', 'temper', 'enjoyment', 'assorted', 'group', 'who', 'learned', 'ancient', 'Egyptian', 'fascination', 'cats', 'book.The', 'cats', 'had', 'only', 'pug', 'noses', 'lots', 'fur', 'maybe', 'Persian', 'were', 'strangest', 'looking', 'cats', 'ever', 'saw', 'must', 'be', 'Japanese', 'Star', 'very', 'pretty', 'face', 'short-haired', 'weird', 'alien', 'cats', 'arrived', 'left', 'kamisake', 'planes', 'attack', 'hound', 'dog', 'weird', 'fat', 'cats', 'resided', 'comatose', 'factory', 'owner', 'Watching', 'drive', 'black', 'limo', 'propel', 'around', 'wired', 'several', 'IVs', 'gave', 'orders', 'workers', 'abandon', 'Mason', 'factory', 'was', 'quite', 'something.The', 'stray', 'greyhound', 'was', 'evocative', 'puzzled', 'hound', 'dogs', 'had', 'decided', 'were', 'Russian', 'spies', 'conference', 'dogs', 'place', 'similar', 'Russian', 'agency', 'something', 'United', 'Nations', 'Canine', 'News', 'Network', 'heard', 'Wolf', 'Blitzer', 'heralding', 'Revolution', 'human', 'race.The', 'cats', 'took', 'over', 'Mason', 'factory', 'captured', 'hound', 'human', 'family', 'hostages', 'secure', 'potion', 'make', 'humans', 'allergic', 'dogs', 'leader', 'World', 'Domination', 'booklet', 'indoctrinate', 'mice', 'how', 'infiltrate', 'sewers', 'infect', 'human', 'existence.The', 'dogs', 'save', 'day', 'scientist', 'family', 'midst', 'fire', 'cats', 'maneuver', 'heavy', 'equipment', 'factory', 'hound', 'air', 'Mighty', 'Mouse', 'quot', 'here', 'save', 'day.', 'quot', 'inferno', 'falling', 'snow', 'discover', 'valuable', 'place', 'family.The', 'big', 'fat', 'white', 'cat', 'up', 'modeling', 'outlandish', 'outfits', 'made', 'foursome', 'sisters', 'big', 'house', 'seemingly', 'fate', 'worse', 'death']",Cats & Dogs
671853,A1EJ6J6N9I7W35,B00005O5DJ,Billy Hollis,"[26, 27]","The premise of the movie is clever. Dogs and cats can talk, think, build machines, and are in general as clever or more clever than we humans, but they just keep it all hidden. And they are in perpetual conflict against each other.The plot is that a human (Jeff Goldblum) is on the verge of discovering a cure for dog allergies, and the cats want to reverse it an make all humans allergic to dogs. It's rather silly, and just furnishes a backdrop against which to show doghouses with sophisticated electronics, ninja cats, and other aspects of the cat vs. dog conflict.Tobey McGuire (Spiderman) voices the protagonist dog, a puppy accidentally inserted into the conflict. Alex Baldwin, Joe Pantoliano, and Susan Sarandon do some of the other dogs. One of the great voices of our age, Charleton Heston is the leader of the dogs, but his part is brief. Sean Hayes gives a nice, over-the-top, supervillianesque performance as the cat antagonist, and Jon Lovitz does a good turn as his assistant. In general the animal voices are the highlight of the movie, along with the continually funny joke of the dogs possessing technology and intelligence about which we humans have no clue.Elizabeth Perkins and Jeff Goldblum lead the cast of humans. Perkins is passable, but this is not one of Goldblum's better efforts. It's really the animal's show. I found the parts with the humans to be pretty boring.The movie contains some good moments with the animals, though, such as the the Russian Blue cat operative breaking into the human's house. It balances out as something worth a watch for a Saturday afternoon popcorn movie, but probably not something you're going to drag out and watch every year or three.",3,"Not a classic comedy, but good for a few laughs",1238803200,"04 4, 2009",2009,1699,"['premise', 'movie', 'clever', 'Dogs', 'cats', 'can', 'talk', 'think', 'build', 'machines', 'are', 'general', 'clever', 'more', 'clever', 'humans', 'just', 'keep', 'hidden', 'are', 'perpetual', 'conflict', 'other.The', 'plot', 'human', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'verge', 'discovering', 'cure', 'dog', 'allergies', 'cats', 'want', 'reverse', 'make', 'humans', 'allergic', 'dogs', 'rather', 'silly', 'just', 'furnishes', 'backdrop', 'show', 'doghouses', 'sophisticated', 'electronics', 'ninja', 'cats', 'other', 'aspects', 'cat', 'vs.', 'dog', 'conflict.Tobey', 'McGuire', 'Spiderman', 'protagonist', 'dog', 'puppy', 'accidentally', 'inserted', 'conflict', 'Alex', 'Baldwin', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'do', 'other', 'dogs', 'One', 'great', 'voices', 'age', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'leader', 'dogs', 'part', 'brief', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'nice', 'over-the-top', 'supervillianesque', 'performance', 'cat', 'antagonist', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'good', 'turn', 'assistant', 'general', 'animal', 'voices', 'are', 'highlight', 'movie', 'continually', 'funny', 'joke', 'dogs', 'possessing', 'technology', 'intelligence', 'humans', 'have', 'clue.Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'lead', 'cast', 'humans', 'Perkins', 'passable', 'not', 'one', 'Goldblum', 'better', 'efforts', 'really', 'animal', 'show', 'found', 'parts', 'humans', 'be', 'pretty', 'boring.The', 'movie', 'good', 'moments', 'animals', 'though', 'such', 'Russian', 'Blue', 'cat', 'operative', 'breaking', 'human', 'house', 'out', 'something', 'watch', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'probably', 'not', 'something', ""'re"", 'going', 'drag', 'out', 'watch', 'year', 'three']",Cats & Dogs

There is a sort of &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; or &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; wizardry to it, but the special effects that it employs have become so commonplace that &quot;Cats and Dogs&quot; seems sort of twice-viewed even though this is its first run.

671879,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005O5DJ,D. Litton,"[18, 22]","In &quot;Cats and Dogs,&quot; perhaps the best family film of the year, you'll get a healthy dose of hearty laughs, humorous jokes, and purr-fect fun. Combining live action animals with special effects and puppets, the movie is not as amusing for its technical wizardry as it is for its grandiose amount of wonderful, lighthearted comedy that is as fluffy as its Persian antagonist. Quite simply, the movie gave me the feeling of being a kid all over again.In a classic role reversal, the movie plays the dogs as our heroes, while the much-beloved feline is the vicious villain. The plot needs little explanation: scientist Brody (Jeff Goldblum) is out to discover a cure for human allergic reactions to dogs. This, of course, has our feline fiends just waiting to get their hands on the finished product in hopes of reversing the process and taking over the world.Led by Mr. Tinkles (voiced with a delightfully cocky wit by actor Sean Hayes), the cats wage an all-out war against the dogs trying to prevent their plans from success. This includes Lou (voiced by Tobey Maguire), who has become the new pet to Brody's son; his inexperience as an agent makes him a prime target for assault, though his comrades, led by the stern Butch (voiced by Alec Baldwin), offer him help and guidance in the ways of becoming an agent.To dismiss the film on the basis of its special effects and plot logic is utterly ridiculous. The movie is a shining example of what it is: a successful children's film that is pleasing in every way imaginable. It features some of the funniest dialogue of the year, which is appealing more to understanding adults, while the non-stop camera movements, cheesy effects, and delightful characters will no doubt carry children along on its wild ride.I found myself laughing uncontrollably with the film, watching such pranks as ninja cats wearing night-vision goggles, a cat coughing up bombs disguised as fur balls, and the best of them all, featuring Mr. Tinkles falling prey to the plump maid of his owner, who dresses him up in lacy outfits (&quot;Evil does not wear a bonnet! Did Genghis Khan ever wear a bonnet?&quot;). It's all in the interest of tickling our fancy, and I must say, I laughed uncontrollably.Though actors Goldblum, Elizabeth Perkins, and Alexander Pollock do impressive work as the human family, they cannot hold a candle to the voice actors who supply the dialogue for our friends in fur, including Tobey Maguire, Alec Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, Michael Duncan Clarke, Joe Pantoliano, and the great Charlton Heston. Each of the characters is voiced magnificently by their actor, though none so brilliant as Sean Hayes, who is a real hoot as Mr. Tinkles. His devilish wit and impressive voice talent are amusing, a Dr. Evil for the younger set, if you will.To call &quot;Cats and Dogs&quot; anything but good, clean fun only proves the cynicism of adulthood. The movie is one of the most enthusiastic and energetic films of the genre I've seen in quite a while, a cross between the animal physicalities of &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; and the technical spy intelligence of the &quot;James Bond&quot; films. This is the ultimate definition of &quot;cute,&quot; and is nothing short of total, complete fun.",4,"Relentlessly funny, successful family feature!",1003449600,"10 19, 2001",2001,3240,"['quot', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'quot', 'perhaps', 'best', 'family', 'film', 'year', ""'ll"", 'get', 'healthy', 'dose', 'hearty', 'laughs', 'humorous', 'jokes', 'purr-fect', 'fun', 'Combining', 'live', 'action', 'animals', 'special', 'effects', 'puppets', 'movie', 'not', 'amusing', 'technical', 'wizardry', 'grandiose', 'amount', 'wonderful', 'lighthearted', 'comedy', 'as', 'fluffy', 'Persian', 'antagonist', 'Quite', 'simply', 'movie', 'gave', 'feeling', 'being', 'kid', 'classic', 'role', 'reversal', 'movie', 'dogs', 'heroes', 'much-beloved', 'feline', 'vicious', 'villain', 'plot', 'little', 'explanation', 'scientist', 'Brody', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'out', 'discover', 'cure', 'human', 'allergic', 'reactions', 'dogs', 'course', 'feline', 'fiends', 'just', 'waiting', 'get', 'hands', 'finished', 'product', 'hopes', 'reversing', 'process', 'taking', 'over', 'world.Led', 'Mr.', 'Tinkles', 'voiced', 'delightfully', 'cocky', 'wit', 'actor', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'cats', 'wage', 'all-out', 'war', 'dogs', 'trying', 'prevent', 'plans', 'success', 'Lou', 'voiced', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'who', 'become', 'new', 'pet', 'Brody', 'son', 'inexperience', 'agent', 'prime', 'target', 'assault', 'comrades', 'led', 'stern', 'Butch', 'voiced', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'offer', 'help', 'guidance', 'ways', 'becoming', 'agent.To', 'dismiss', 'film', 'basis', 'special', 'effects', 'plot', 'logic', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'shining', 'example', 'what', 'successful', 'children', 'film', 'pleasing', 'way', 'imaginable', 'funniest', 'dialogue', 'year', 'appealing', 'more', 'understanding', 'adults', 'non-stop', 'camera', 'movements', 'cheesy', 'effects', 'delightful', 'characters', 'will', 'doubt', 'carry', 'children', 'wild', 'ride.I', 'found', 'laughing', 'uncontrollably', 'film', 'watching', 'such', 'pranks', 'ninja', 'cats', 'wearing', 'night-vision', 'goggles', 'cat', 'coughing', 'up', 'bombs', 'disguised', 'fur', 'balls', 'best', 'featuring', 'Mr.', 'Tinkles', 'falling', 'prey', 'plump', 'maid', 'owner', 'who', 'up', 'lacy', 'outfits', 'quot', 'Evil', 'not', 'wear', 'bonnet', 'Did', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'ever', 'wear', 'bonnet', 'quot', 'interest', 'tickling', 'fancy', 'must', 'say', 'laughed', 'uncontrollably.Though', 'actors', 'Goldblum', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'Alexander', 'Pollock', 'do', 'impressive', 'work', 'human', 'family', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'voice', 'actors', 'who', 'supply', 'dialogue', 'friends', 'fur', 'including', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Michael', 'Duncan', 'Clarke', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'great', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'characters', 'voiced', 'magnificently', 'actor', 'none', 'so', 'brilliant', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'who', 'real', 'hoot', 'Mr.', 'Tinkles', 'devilish', 'wit', 'impressive', 'voice', 'talent', 'are', 'amusing', 'Dr', 'Evil', 'younger', 'set', 'will.To', 'call', 'quot', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'quot', 'anything', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'only', 'cynicism', 'adulthood', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'enthusiastic', 'energetic', 'films', 'genre', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'while', 'cross', 'animal', 'physicalities', 'quot', 'Homeward', 'Bound', 'quot', 'technical', 'spy', 'intelligence', 'quot', 'James', 'Bond', 'quot', 'films', 'ultimate', 'definition', 'quot', 'cute', 'quot', 'nothing', 'short', 'total', 'complete', 'fun']",Cats & Dogs

Of all there movies, this is one that I sort of enjoy. I like its idea of a war between cats and dogs that are secretly more technologically advanced than we are, and a lot of cleverness went into the situations, but the dialog is a bit corny. There's a load of great acting talent, but their main instruction seems to have been to ham it up for the kids. I'm not particularly fond of the animations in this, either.When a movie like this comes out and does something that hasn't been done before (in this case, mixing live-action and animation to tell a story with talking and ninja-fighting animals), it makes a big splash. Then, a few years later, when technology's improved and many other movies can do the same thing but make it look more realistic, that first movie will be forgotten if there isn't a great movie behind all the effects.A word of warning-This is NOT a movie for cat lovers. Cats are portrayed as the typical villain, obsessed with world domination. While dogs are made out to be the heroes who not only save the world from allergies but also rescue the humans. If you're looking for meowing fluff balls that save the day, you're watching the wrong movie in this case.It's a fun movie for kids, up to a certain age.

This film is good, clean, and downright fun to watch. The tedious time spent on the special effects for the dogs and cats to do stunts and talking is absolutely amazing. Don't let the PG rating fool you adults! I appreciate the film maker's strive to bring this film to not only children, but to its teen and adult audience. Animal aficionados will adore this action-packed, emotional, and comedic film about the war between cats and dogs.PlotThe dog species actually has an intelligent agency behind it with trained agents protecting man kind 24/7 against the evil plots of cats. When the Brody family dog is catnapped the Dog HQ Agency calls in an elite team of puppies to have one picked to replace the family dog. The Brody family father (Jeff Goldblum) is developing a formula to stop the allergy some humans have with dogs. By accident a beagle is the replacement and must help protect the family with the assistance of the other dogs. From there cats try to kill the beagle (Lou), but fail as Lou learns quickly the prerequisites of a dog agent. The whole family will enjoy this exciting, positive, comedic film from start to end!Pros:1. Meticulous special effects used to create the communication and fights between the cats and dogs.2. Excellent plot3. Great voices of the felines and canines by brilliant actors. (i.e. John Lovitz, Charlton Heston, Susan Sarandon, Tobey Maguire, and Sean Hayes)4.

Mr. Tinkles lives in a mansion with his comatose, elderly owner, and a portly maid who is obsessed with dressing the poor kitty in humiliating outfits.  Sheesh, no wonder cats want to rule humans!On the side of protecting humans are the dogs.  Inquisitive beagle puppy Lou (voiced by Tobey Maguire) stumbles into the secret headquarters of the dogs.  Lou becomes an agent.  His reluctant mentor is Butch (voiced by Alec Baldwin).  Lou falls in love with the family he is placed with, despite orders to not get attached and focus on the mission.One of the funniest scenes is when Mr. Tinkles and his henchmen are trying to drive a limo with his comatose owner in the driver's seat.  The ninja cats beating up Lou are pretty great, too.  The drawings of his plan are also hysterical - especially the dirigible.  Otherwise, the film was a little disappointing because of the treatment of dogs as perfect creatures.",3,Unfair to Cats!,1110326400,"03 9, 2005",2005,1343,"['better', 'title', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Cats', 'Vs', 'Dogs', 'think', 'average', 'moviewatcher', 'producers', 'target', 'audience', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'understood', 'meaning', 'versus', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'secret', 'plans', 'cats', 'subjugate', 'humans', 'slaves', 'used', 'be', 'ancient', 'Egypt', 'Hence', 'explanation', 'Egyptians', 'worshipping', 'cats', 'leader', 'plan', 'white', 'Persian', 'cat', 'Mr.', 'Tinkles', 'Mr.', 'Tinkles', 'mansion', 'comatose', 'elderly', 'owner', 'portly', 'maid', 'who', 'obsessed', 'dressing', 'poor', 'kitty', 'humiliating', 'outfits', 'Sheesh', 'wonder', 'want', 'rule', 'humans', 'side', 'protecting', 'humans', 'are', 'dogs', 'Inquisitive', 'beagle', 'puppy', 'Lou', 'voiced', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'secret', 'headquarters', 'dogs', 'Lou', 'agent', 'reluctant', 'mentor', 'Butch', 'voiced', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Lou', 'love', 'family', 'placed', 'orders', 'not', 'get', 'attached', 'focus', 'mission.One', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Tinkles', 'henchmen', 'are', 'trying', 'drive', 'limo', 'comatose', 'owner', 'driver', 'seat', 'ninja', 'cats', 'beating', 'up', 'Lou', 'are', 'pretty', 'great', 'too', 'drawings', 'plan', 'are', 'also', 'hysterical', 'especially', 'dirigible', 'Otherwise', 'film', 'was', 'little', 'disappointing', 'treatment', 'dogs', 'perfect', 'creatures']",Cats & Dogs

671923,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005O5DJ,Matthew Horner,"[0, 0]","Cats and Dogs is a family movie that uses live action, animation and computer generated effects. It tells the story of an ongoing war between cats and dogs that occurs behind our backs. How much you will enjoy it depends on a couple of things. The closer you are to the age of twelve, the more fun it will be. Where you stand on whether canines or felines make the best pets is the other factor. Not only does the movie portray dogs as definitely our best friends, it claims that only they stand in the way of cats' ultimate goal of world domination. This is all shown in a comic and entertaining fashion, and it works for me. I've never met a cat I could trust.Professor Brody [Jeff Goldblum] lives with his wife [Elizabeth Perkins] and son, Scott [Alexander Pollock], in one of those picture perfect, white picket fence neighborhoods you used to see only in Steven Spielburg movies, but can now find anywhere in the country. To we humans, the professor is as unthreatening as they come. To cats, he is the greatest threat on the planet because he is working on a formula which will cure us of all allergies caused by dogs. They decide to destroy his work and substitute their own product, which will make everyone highly allergic to dogs. The kitties start off by catnapping the Brody's dog, who is really a canine secret agent put there to protect them. The dogs respond by sending in another agent, but a mistake is made. An untrained puppy named Lou [Tobey Maguire] gets the job. A big dog called Butch [Alec Baldwin] does his best to aid and train Lou. Meanwhile, the evil [and hilarious] Persian cat, Mr. Tinkles {Sean Hayes], will lead his feline army to victory, if only he can stay clear of his master's housekeeper, who delights in dressing him up in the dreadful outfits she makes. It's just so humiliating!When live action is mixed with animation, the live characters usually lose out. Cats and Dogs is no exception. The few scenes of the Brody family's interacting with each other drag. Jeff Goldblum, once a promising actor, has in the last decade made considerable income playing in movies where he is essentially an expensive prop.I have noted that dogs are the heroes here, but cats are a lot more fun. The dogs get all the warm, cuddly responses. The cats get all the laughs, especially the abominable Mr. Tinkles and some ninja cats who nearly steal the show.

Here dogs are the undisputed good guys, whilst cats are all evil.  Cats are underway to ensure that scientist Jeff Goldblum will never finish his serum to make all humans allergy-free to dogs.  They plan to reverse the effects to make everyone allergic to dogs.Perhaps the most frustrating thing about 'Cats And Dogs' is that it's obviously biased, especially for a movie that scoffs at people for actually having a favourite animal!  That said, the special effects are fantastic and it's jam-packed with great characters and one-liners.  For instance, a dog labelling himself 'Toto Annihilation' will have you rolling in your seats.  Plus there's the fact that cat lovers can console themselves in the fact that the felines are undoubtedly the best characters, from the dictatorship of Mr Tinkles to the Samurai fighting cats and the Russian spy cat.  The dogs, for their part, are mostly pretty wet, except for a marvellous Susan Sarandon as a stray mutt.  Although it's surprising that many of the celebrity voices are highly unrecognisable.  Indeed, you hardly notice Alec Baldwin or Toby Maguire.Unfortunately though, for all it's style and obvious wit, it still has such a lame plot that you'll be gagging from some real action.  It's the characters that engage rather than the big action sets.  The idea is good too, but it's still more flashy effects than story or character progression.

671937,A1OH2SIJ0U46Q6,B00005O5DJ,"""patsydoc""","[5, 9]","""Cats and Dogs"" was a promising looking movie:  it had talking cats and dogs (sounds like fun!).  Not only did the film have talking cats and dogs, but most of the cats and dogs were secret agents and had lots of cool ""Mission Impossible"" like gizmos (sounds like even more fun!).So let's recap, we've got talking cats and dogs and cool gizmos...seems like a good combination right?  But we forgot one important ingredient: an interesting plot!As anyone can tell from the trailers, this movie is about cats and dogs (who talk don't forget) waging war on each other.  Sure it's a funny concept, and the first 5 minutes of the film worked well using a sort of Tom and Jerry approach to the idea....but the remaining 90 minutes, the remaining 90 minutes was the problem.The meager plot (which took up the last 90 minutes of the movie) was about a young pup named, Lou who gets mistaken for a secret agent.  Lou must guard a secret formula that would make humans not allergic to dogs.  The cats want the formula destroyed for obvious reasons but somehow that gets mixed in with some weird plot for cats to take over the world.  That's it.  Nothing else happens and except for all the gags you saw in the trailer....nothing else in the movie is very funny.  That is, unless you thinka cat saying ""Cats rule!"" every 5 minutes is funny.  Ha....ha.  No.Recommendation:  Don't buy movie.  It was boring.  Don't even rent this movie.  It was boring.

671941,A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q,B00005O5DJ,Priscilla Stafford,"[6, 10]","&quot;Cats and Dogs&quot; is the story of scientist Professor Brody (Jeff Goldblum) who is working on a cure for all dog allergies. It's up to the dogs to protect his work from the evil cats lead by Mr. Tinkles (Sean Hayes). The cat's plan: to reverse the chemical for curing dog allergy to making it so when humans take it, they will be allergic to all dogs. Then cats will rule the world. But instead of the dog leader Agent Butch (Alec Baldwin) getting a professional replacement for retired agent Buddy, he gets a young beagle puppy, Lou (Tobey Maguire), instead.Has a pretty simple plot with some hilarious parts. Yet very stupid, with the animation very, very obvious like the 'ninja kitties'. Reminded me a lot of &quot;102 Dalmations&quot; except this movie has James Bond 007 thrown in.But the biggest reason for giving this movie 4 stars is the voice talents from stars Alec Baldwin (one of my most favorite actors in his role in &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;), Tobey Maguire, Sean Hayes, Susan Sarandon (Played with another one of my favorite actors Kevin Costner in &quot;Bull Durham&quot;), Joe Pantoliano (&quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, and &quot;U.S. Marshals&quot;), and Charlton Heston (&quot;Ben Hur&quot;, &quot;Ten Commandments&quot; and &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;). It was pretty fun for me to watch the movie and guess whose voice was whose. Got most of it correct. The other reason for giving it 4 stars was the humor for some of the humor was funny, others not. Favorite parts are:Sean Hayes as Mr. Tinkles when forced to where a bonnet: &quot;Does evil where a bonnet?&quot;Jeff Goldblum as Professor Brody, thinking there's a burglar in the house: &quot;I've got a mitt and I'm not afraid to use it.&quot;Alec Baldwin as Butch, when Lou (Toby Maguire) tries to eat an dynamite disguised as a cookie: &quot;That would have been the shortest assignment in history.&quot; And more but can't write it all down.All-in-all, a pretty cute flick for maybe young kids and adults, not much for teenagers I think.",4,&quot;Cats and Dogs&quot; is a cute flick!,1004745600,"11 3, 2001",2001,2058,"['quot', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'quot', 'story', 'scientist', 'Professor', 'Brody', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'who', 'working', 'cure', 'dog', 'allergies', 'up', 'dogs', 'protect', 'work', 'evil', 'cats', 'lead', 'Mr.', 'Tinkles', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'cat', 'plan', 'reverse', 'chemical', 'curing', 'dog', 'allergy', 'making', 'so', 'when', 'humans', 'take', 'will', 'be', 'allergic', 'dogs', 'Then', 'cats', 'will', 'rule', 'world', 'instead', 'dog', 'leader', 'Agent', 'Butch', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'getting', 'professional', 'replacement', 'retired', 'agent', 'Buddy', 'young', 'beagle', 'puppy', 'Lou', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'pretty', 'simple', 'plot', 'hilarious', 'parts', 'very', 'stupid', 'animation', 'very', 'very', 'obvious', ""'ninja"", 'kitties', 'Reminded', 'lot', 'quot', '102', 'Dalmations', 'quot', 'movie', 'James', 'Bond', '007', 'thrown', 'in.But', 'biggest', 'reason', 'giving', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'voice', 'talents', 'stars', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'one', 'most', 'favorite', 'actors', 'role', 'quot', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'quot', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Played', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'quot', 'Bull', 'Durham', 'quot', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'quot', 'Matrix', 'quot', 'quot', 'Fugitive', 'quot', 'quot', 'U.S.', 'Marshals', 'quot', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'quot', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'quot', 'quot', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'quot', 'was', 'pretty', 'fun', 'watch', 'movie', 'guess', 'voice', 'was', 'Got', 'most', 'correct', 'other', 'reason', 'giving', '4', 'stars', 'was', 'humor', 'humor', 'was', 'funny', 'others', 'not', 'Favorite', 'parts', 'are', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'Mr.', 'Tinkles', 'when', 'forced', 'where', 'bonnet', 'quot', 'Does', 'evil', 'where', 'bonnet', 'quot', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'Professor', 'Brody', 'thinking', 'burglar', 'house', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'got', 'mitt', ""'m"", 'not', 'afraid', 'use', 'it.', 'quot', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Butch', 'when', 'Lou', 'Toby', 'Maguire', 'eat', 'dynamite', 'disguised', 'cookie', 'quot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'shortest', 'assignment', 'history.', 'quot', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'write', 'down.All-in-all', 'pretty', 'cute', 'flick', 'maybe', 'young', 'kids', 'adults', 'not', 'much', 'teenagers', 'think']",Cats & Dogs

However, Russian Blues have green eyes -- and ONLY green eyes.  The ""Russian Blue"" in the film has copper-bronze eyes, more like a Chartreux (a blue French cat).Those ignorant about cats commonly mistake all blue (i.e., gray) cats for Russian Blues, since they're the most famous of the blue cats.  But the Chartreux and Korat also come in blue, as does the British Blue.Still, so much effort went into this film in other areas, I'm surprised the filmmakers got the Russian Blue wrong.2. Furthermore, the film's ""Russian Blue"" appears to have faint tabby markings, and true Russian Blues have solid coats.  (As do Chatreaux and Korats.)3. Elizabeth Perkins variously refers to the Russian Blue as ""he"" and ""her.""  Sloppy, sloppy.4. Elsewhere in the film, a dog spots Calico (a cat) approaching, and refers to Calico as ""he.""  He is a he, however male calicos are very rare, most are female, but okay.  However, Calico is NOT even a calico, as he clearly has tabby markings.  So why is he named Calico?As with Perkin's variously refering to the Russian Blue ""he"" and ""her,"" it's as though the filmmakers just don't think much thought need be given to the cats.  The dogs are the stars.Other than that, like most Hollywood ""high concept"" films, the idea is clever, the technical execution skilled, but the story peters out well before the end of the film.
