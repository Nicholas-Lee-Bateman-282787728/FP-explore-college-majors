921041,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B000A4513C,C. Middleton,"[39, 41]","Over the last fifteen years, NDE (Near Death Experience) has caught the interest of the medical and scientific communities. As a recent Gallup poll suggests, one in twenty Americans have had some form of a NDE, and what is compelling, is that the reports are all strikingly similar in content. Although severely lacking in production value, The Lazarus Phenomenon more than makes up in content, because the two testimonials are indeed extraordinary, provoking serious thought on the subject.The first testimonial is of the African preacher who died in a car accident. He was pronounced dead (he still possess his Death Certificate) and sent to a mortuary, where is body laid for three days. Strangely, the preacher's wife ""knew"" that he would come back to her, and asked that his body be moved from the mortuary and taken to the preacher's church. We next see his parishioners surrounding the body all in deep prayer. Viewed from an amateur video, we see the man start to breath and awaken with an expression of shock and confusion. The man had indeed returned from the dead. But what did he experience over that seventy-two hour period?The preacher admits to seeing two angels, who take him to a land of extraordinary colour a limitless space. Both walk over a hill and the preacher sees a vast crowd of people who seem to resemble the angel. At first he believes these beings to be angels, but he's told they are saints, singing the praises of the Lord. The sounds of their singing is nothing the preacher had ever heard before, so beautiful, that the music could well transport him to another more wondrous place. The angel then takes him to the Gates of Hell. It is here that the preacher witness's the suffering of those souls who refused to follow the word of God and have been sentenced to an eternity of suffering. The angel tells him that his destiny is hell because in his heart he has failed to forgive his wife. In fact ""forgiveness"" is the central theme in both stories, because in order to be forgiven we must forgive the transgressions of others to ourselves. He pleads for another chance and is returned to the physical sphere to genuinely forgive his wife and his enemies.The other testimonial is from a New Zealander who had been stung by a poisonous jellyfish in South East Asia. As this man tells his story, one can perceive great emotion and the fact that this experience changed his life in a profound way. While watching this man, I was reminded of the philosopher, William James and his book, The Varieties of Religious Experience, where James concludes that a ""real"" experience is followed by a profound change in the person's values and behaviour. This was certainly true of the New Zealander, because he was truly ""reborn"" as his values changed considerably to a life of Christian devotion and good works.Rather than illustrate this man's experience, suffice to say that again, the central theme was ""forgiveness""; that before one can enter the kingdom of God, one must genuinely forgive one's enemies before being forgiven.Medical practitioners and scientists are currently changing their views on NDE, no more attributing the experience as hallucination due to brain chemistry. The NDE's are too similar in content and too profound to attribute it as a mere chemical reaction.What has truly stumped many doctor's are those cases where someone has been blind since birth and actually can ""see"" during their near death experience, describing in minute detail their surroundings after being resuscitated.In my opinion the testimonials of little children who have come close to death or have actually died, return to describe their experiences from their innocent perspective; their accounts are truly moving and strike at the heart.It is a shame that the overall production value of this documentary is poor. However, the content is fascinating, the testimonials extraordinary, provoking serious thought about the possibility of life after death.

921044,A123Z3NWDM3TTG,B000A4513C,"Evelyn O. Simon ""webstore owner""","[4, 6]","The documentary starts off with a parable Jesus told, of the rich man and Lazarus the beggar, who begged for the crumbs from the rich man's table.It was told the rich man died in his ways, and went to hell. When Lazarus died, he went to heaven. The rich man saw Lazarus at the foot of the prophet Abraham from a far, and begged for water to quench his thirst; Abraham explained how it wasn't possible to fulfill his request.The second story was of the African Pastor, and his experience with death.He was declared dead for three days; his body had been embalmed.Upon his spiritual visit, it was told to him by an angel, of what happened between him and his wife that led to his resentment against her, that if the book of judgment were to close upon him, hell would be his portion.The 3D effects, lets you visualize what the African man had seen.The moral of this, is,God doesn't care if you had given your life to Him, and call yourself a Christian, and or a Pastor, a Preacher; if you do not keep His commandments, and if you completely turn your back on Him, you will be judged according to your actions here on earth.The third story was of the New Zealander, named Ian Mc Cormack, and of his near death experience. He had been stung several times by poisonous, boxed jellyfish.It was the knowledge upon remembering his mother, and what she had always told him to pray when he was in trouble; that alone, urged Ian to ask God to teach him what to say in prayer. The 3D visualization of his near death experience, will have you glued to the TV screen.Ian McCormack conducts a fervent prayer, on the special features of the DvD.I've concluded the movie as being an informative masterpiece; a tool to save, encourage and deliver one from eternal damnation.I really recommend this teaching tool for new, old, and non Christians alike.",5,A phenomenal phenomenon!,1195776000,"11 23, 2007",2007,1833,"['documentary', 'starts', 'parable', 'Jesus', 'told', 'rich', 'man', 'Lazarus', 'beggar', 'who', 'begged', 'crumbs', 'rich', 'man', 'table.It', 'was', 'told', 'rich', 'man', 'died', 'ways', 'went', 'hell', 'When', 'Lazarus', 'died', 'went', 'heaven', 'rich', 'man', 'saw', 'Lazarus', 'foot', 'prophet', 'Abraham', 'far', 'begged', 'water', 'quench', 'thirst', 'Abraham', 'explained', 'how', 'was', ""n't"", 'possible', 'fulfill', 'request.The', 'second', 'story', 'was', 'African', 'Pastor', 'experience', 'death.He', 'was', 'declared', 'dead', 'three', 'days', 'body', 'had', 'been', 'spiritual', 'visit', 'was', 'told', 'angel', 'what', 'happened', 'wife', 'led', 'resentment', 'book', 'judgment', 'were', 'close', 'hell', 'would', 'be', 'portion.The', '3D', 'effects', 'visualize', 'what', 'African', 'man', 'had', 'seen.The', 'moral', 'God', ""n't"", 'care', 'had', 'given', 'life', 'Him', 'call', 'Christian', 'Pastor', 'Preacher', 'do', 'not', 'keep', 'commandments', 'completely', 'turn', 'back', 'Him', 'will', 'be', 'judged', 'according', 'actions', 'here', 'earth.The', 'third', 'story', 'was', 'New', 'Zealander', 'named', 'Ian', 'Mc', 'Cormack', 'near', 'death', 'experience', 'had', 'been', 'stung', 'several', 'times', 'poisonous', 'boxed', 'jellyfish.It', 'was', 'knowledge', 'remembering', 'mother', 'what', 'had', 'always', 'told', 'pray', 'when', 'was', 'trouble', 'alone', 'urged', 'Ian', 'ask', 'God', 'teach', 'what', 'say', 'prayer', '3D', 'visualization', 'near', 'death', 'experience', 'will', 'have', 'glued', 'TV', 'screen.Ian', 'McCormack', 'fervent', 'prayer', 'special', 'features', 'DvD.I', ""'ve"", 'concluded', 'movie', 'being', 'informative', 'masterpiece', 'tool', 'save', 'encourage', 'deliver', 'one', 'eternal', 'damnation.I', 'really', 'recommend', 'teaching', 'tool', 'new', 'old', 'non', 'Christians', 'alike']",N/A
