Like Monte Walsh, the story follows a tried and true cowboy's nostalgic efforts to hold on to the only life he knows. Even being roped down in order to help his brother keep his homestead and an appealing lady friend aren't enough to make Huey Calloway (Jones) settle down.A wonderful movie, THE GOOD OLD BOYS features terrific performances by Jones, Sissy Spacek, Francis McDormand, Sam Shepard, Wilford Brimley and Matt Damon. A cameo performance by Larry Mahan, one of the greatest rodeo cowboys ever, adds some wonderful spice and authenticity,As Jones rides off into the sunset, like Tom Selleck in Monte Walsh, the hope and the dream that cowboys will continue to ride is very artfully expressed.Where in the heck is the DVD for this one?THE HORSEMAN",5,JONES BRINGS THIS KELTON WESTERN TO LIFE,1131321600,"11 7, 2005",2005,844,"['Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Elmer', 'Kelton', 'western', 'classic', 'life', 'THE', 'GOOD', 'OLD', 'BOYS', 'Monte', 'Walsh', 'story', 'tried', 'true', 'cowboy', 'nostalgic', 'efforts', 'hold', 'only', 'life', 'Even', 'being', 'roped', 'down', 'order', 'help', 'brother', 'keep', 'homestead', 'appealing', 'lady', 'friend', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'Huey', 'Calloway', 'Jones', 'settle', 'down.A', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'GOOD', 'OLD', 'BOYS', 'terrific', 'performances', 'Jones', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Francis', 'McDormand', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Wilford', 'Brimley', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'A', 'cameo', 'performance', 'Larry', 'Mahan', 'one', 'greatest', 'rodeo', 'cowboys', 'ever', 'wonderful', 'spice', 'authenticity', 'Jones', 'sunset', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'Monte', 'Walsh', 'hope', 'dream', 'will', 'continue', 'ride', 'very', 'artfully', 'expressed.Where', 'heck', 'DVD', 'one', 'HORSEMAN']",The Good Old Boys VHS

Talk about the sensation of being from another planet! We were amazed to discover that the movie is truly awful (read: AWFUL). Jones was clearly worshipping at his own altar, with incessant lingering close-ups of his grinning face. Like Costner's self-glorifying DANCES WITH WOLVES, THE GOOD OLD BOYS rarely sports a single frame which does not showcase Jones. Neither star is sufficiently talented as an actor or as a director to carry an entire film, yet both are compelled to take their places on both sides of the camera. When Jones isn't chewing the scenery with those all-too-exposed teeth (the man literally never closes his lips from start to finish), he is directing the wasted Spacek in a thankless role as a frustrated spinster. More offensive than Spacek's painfully over-the-top girlishness is the notion that ANY woman - frustrated or otherwise - would pursue an unbathed, aging, penniless, dim-witted drifter whose ludicrously exaggerated accent could scrape paint off a fender.",1,Jones in SELF-INDULGENT Mode,1199404800,"01 4, 2008",2008,1159,"['strength', 'consistent', 'rave', 'reviews', 'here', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'project', 'co-wrote', 'directed', 'starred', 'film', 'got', 'over-priced', 'video', 'Talk', 'sensation', 'being', 'planet', 'were', 'amazed', 'discover', 'movie', 'truly', 'awful', 'read', 'AWFUL', 'Jones', 'was', 'clearly', 'worshipping', 'own', 'altar', 'incessant', 'lingering', 'close-ups', 'grinning', 'face', 'Costner', 'self-glorifying', 'DANCES', 'WITH', 'WOLVES', 'THE', 'GOOD', 'OLD', 'BOYS', 'rarely', 'sports', 'single', 'frame', 'not', 'showcase', 'Jones', 'Neither', 'star', 'sufficiently', 'talented', 'actor', 'director', 'carry', 'entire', 'film', 'are', 'compelled', 'take', 'places', 'sides', 'camera', 'When', 'Jones', ""n't"", 'chewing', 'scenery', 'all-too-exposed', 'teeth', 'man', 'literally', 'never', 'lips', 'start', 'finish', 'directing', 'wasted', 'Spacek', 'thankless', 'role', 'frustrated', 'spinster', 'More', 'offensive', 'Spacek', 'painfully', 'over-the-top', 'girlishness', 'notion', 'ANY', 'woman', 'frustrated', 'otherwise', 'would', 'pursue', 'unbathed', 'aging', 'penniless', 'dim-witted', 'drifter', 'ludicrously', 'exaggerated', 'accent', 'could', 'scrape', 'paint', 'off', 'fender']",The Good Old Boys VHS
