765772,A354HH188OAJUU,B0000AQS0F,,"[10, 10]","After a severe rough patch in the road for science fiction in general (Farscape and Firefly fall victim to a fatal form of the same disease; network myopia!), there's something to cheer about!I have rated fewer than a dozen books or movies at 5 stars in the last 25 years.  I have never been hooked so hard, so fast by a TV show, regardless of genre.  The individual characters gave me that kitten with a ball of yarn feeling... I HAVE to know more! Add lots of action and the creator's signature (rapid-fire, often slicing, and usually unexpected) character interaction, and I thought I was about to escape from network sitcom/""reality show"" hell!  Unfortunately, it didn't last.There is room in good scifi for all kinds.  Over the years, I've enjoyed more so-called ""mainstream"" scifi such as Star Wars, Trek, and Gate, SG1, B5, and countless others for different reasons.  (Unfortunately, far more have landed in the mediocre to sub-sewage categories.) Firefly was one of the few that appealed to my taste for something further out on the edge; a little dark, definitely adult; often laugh-out-loud funny- no laugh track required; where everything may not be what it appears, or it just might be; something you have to work at a little to understand, but always beautifully written and acted.  If that might also interest you, I strongly recommend this series in whatever form it is available, wherever, whenever. My husband and I agreed- we're getting the DVD as soon as it's available; THEN we'll worry about getting a DVD player!!!  Serenity definitely deserves to keep flying!",5,All Hail ONE bright Spot in Recent Scifi...,1060387200,"08 9, 2003",2003,1583,"['severe', 'rough', 'patch', 'road', 'science', 'fiction', 'general', 'Farscape', 'Firefly', 'fall', 'victim', 'fatal', 'form', 'same', 'disease', 'network', 'myopia', 'something', 'cheer', 'have', 'rated', 'fewer', 'dozen', 'books', 'movies', '5', 'stars', 'last', '25', 'years', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'hooked', 'so', 'hard', 'fast', 'TV', 'show', 'regardless', 'genre', 'individual', 'characters', 'gave', 'ball', 'yarn', 'feeling', 'HAVE', 'know', 'more', 'Add', 'lots', 'action', 'creator', 'signature', 'rapid-fire', 'often', 'slicing', 'usually', 'unexpected', 'character', 'interaction', 'thought', 'was', 'about', 'escape', 'network', 'sitcom/', 'reality', 'show', 'hell', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'last.There', 'room', 'good', 'scifi', 'kinds', 'years', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'more', 'so-called', 'mainstream', 'scifi', 'such', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Trek', 'Gate', 'SG1', 'B5', 'countless', 'others', 'different', 'reasons', 'Unfortunately', 'far', 'more', 'have', 'landed', 'mediocre', 'sub-sewage', 'categories', 'Firefly', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'appealed', 'taste', 'something', 'further', 'out', 'edge', 'little', 'dark', 'definitely', 'adult', 'often', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny-', 'laugh', 'track', 'required', 'where', 'everything', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'have', 'work', 'little', 'understand', 'always', 'beautifully', 'written', 'acted', 'might', 'also', 'interest', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'series', 'form', 'available', 'wherever', 'whenever', 'husband', 'agreed-', ""'re"", 'getting', 'DVD', 'as', 'soon', 'available', 'THEN', ""'ll"", 'worry', 'getting', 'DVD', 'player', 'Serenity', 'definitely', 'keep', 'flying']",N/A
765773,A106016KSI0YQ,B0000AQS0F,,"[13, 14]","FIREFLY is one of the most fiercely loved cult television shows ever made, and it greatly deserves to be. In its abbreviated only season, it managed to produce such a memorably palpable universe and set of characters that it was eventually allowed to continue its story in a film version, SERENITY, that did not do as well as hoped in its theatrical release but that has enjoyed enough success on its DVD run that it has produced a whole new set of fans curious about the original show (myself included). Its central idea is elegantly simple: set in a future analogous to the Reconstruction after the American civil war, a group of renegades, led by a soldier on the rebellion's losing side, try to make ends meet by accepting dubious work smuggling goods (and even sometimes pulling heists) in a very corruptly run political system. The brooding romantic captain and his cohort form the nucleus of the band, with her jokester husband, a tough hired muscle, a sweet-tempered mechanic, a stiff doctor, his mysterious and emotionally disturbed younger sister, and an extremely ethical preacher forming the rest of the group. Oh, and of course in this homage to John Ford's STAGECOACH there is also a (state licensed) prostitute with a heart of gold, whose ongoing bantering love-hate relationship with the captain forms one of the highlights of the entire series (and seems surprisingly fresh).The episodes are written more like miniature films than typical television hour-long shows, and there's usually a fine sense of atmosphere (moreover, the special effects are surprisingly sophisticated and convincing). The tone from episode to episode can shift dramatically, from very jokey episodes to very haunting or grim ones. The show's creator Joss Whedon is best known for his earlier series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, but FIREFLY is surprisingly quite different in style and type from BUFFY, although it retains the very best things about that earlier (and more widely popular) series: the strong and original characters, the funny and unexpected banter, and most of all the emphasis on community and on heart.",5,Days of future past,1139011200,"02 4, 2006",2006,2109,"['FIREFLY', 'one', 'most', 'fiercely', 'loved', 'cult', 'television', 'ever', 'made', 'greatly', 'be', 'abbreviated', 'only', 'season', 'managed', 'produce', 'memorably', 'palpable', 'universe', 'set', 'characters', 'was', 'eventually', 'allowed', 'continue', 'story', 'film', 'version', 'SERENITY', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'hoped', 'theatrical', 'release', 'enjoyed', 'enough', 'success', 'DVD', 'run', 'produced', 'whole', 'new', 'set', 'fans', 'curious', 'original', 'show', 'included', 'central', 'idea', 'elegantly', 'simple', 'set', 'future', 'analogous', 'Reconstruction', 'American', 'civil', 'war', 'group', 'renegades', 'led', 'soldier', 'rebellion', 'losing', 'side', 'try', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'accepting', 'dubious', 'work', 'smuggling', 'goods', 'even', 'sometimes', 'pulling', 'heists', 'very', 'corruptly', 'run', 'political', 'system', 'brooding', 'romantic', 'captain', 'cohort', 'form', 'nucleus', 'band', 'jokester', 'husband', 'tough', 'hired', 'muscle', 'sweet-tempered', 'mechanic', 'stiff', 'doctor', 'mysterious', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'younger', 'sister', 'extremely', 'ethical', 'preacher', 'forming', 'rest', 'group', 'Oh', 'course', 'homage', 'John', 'Ford', 'STAGECOACH', 'also', 'state', 'licensed', 'prostitute', 'heart', 'gold', 'ongoing', 'bantering', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'captain', 'one', 'highlights', 'entire', 'series', 'surprisingly', 'fresh', '.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'written', 'more', 'like', 'miniature', 'films', 'typical', 'television', 'hour-long', 'shows', 'usually', 'fine', 'sense', 'atmosphere', 'moreover', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'sophisticated', 'convincing', 'tone', 'episode', 'episode', 'can', 'shift', 'dramatically', 'very', 'jokey', 'episodes', 'very', 'haunting', 'grim', 'ones', 'show', 'creator', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'best', 'known', 'earlier', 'series', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'FIREFLY', 'surprisingly', 'quite', 'different', 'style', 'type', 'BUFFY', 'very', 'best', 'things', 'earlier', 'more', 'widely', 'popular', 'series', 'strong', 'original', 'characters', 'funny', 'unexpected', 'banter', 'most', 'emphasis', 'community', 'heart']",N/A
765774,A3USP7JY7U3TW2,B0000AQS0F,,"[13, 14]","First off, I haven't seen the Firefly series and even after the movie Serenity came out, I ignored it. However, due to the repeated recommendations of Amazon, I decided to check it out at my local store. And boy, I didn't realize what I was missing!If you're a Star Wars fan, partial to ""weird west"" cartoons like Trigun, Bravestarr and the more recent Gun X Sword and lapped up the PC game Privateer a decade ago, Firefly is a must-see TV. It also echoes the venerable Star Trek franchise, with the crew dropped in (mostly illegal) situations during their voyages. However, Firefly transcends them all with its witty characterizations, uncontrived plot twists, brisk pacing and all around energy.I would not go into the plots since it's mostly covered by the editorial and customer reviews. But one thing I noticed about the Firefly series is its refreshing lack of space battles. In fact, the ship Serenity itself has no guns and that is a major ""twist"" in space-based TV shows.The show hits all the geek notes in the right way. From a roguish crew, evil corporations, criminal lowlifes, and even lesbian kissing. It's almost like Han Solo: The Series, but better.The DVD set itself is way, way excellent. Aside from humorous and enlightening commentaries from Joss Whedon, it features the aforementioned final three episodes, deleted scenes and a gag reel. One caveat though for parents. Firefly contains sex scenes (you cannot label it ""suggested sex scenes"" since you can see them doing it clearly - there's no other way you can interpret it otherwise - hey I'm not complaining! :)) and other scenes of sensitive nature. The violence part, is surprisingly tame for my standards (even the torture scenes) but there is a substantial chunk in the series.Overall, after seeing the series, you will wonder what were the Fox executives thinking when they cancelled an excellent series like Firefly. Good thing, there's DVD (and movie franchises) to make up for capriciousness and ignorance of network executives.",5,Must-see Sci Fi TV,1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,2011,"['First', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Firefly', 'series', 'even', 'movie', 'Serenity', 'came', 'out', 'ignored', 'However', 'due', 'repeated', 'recommendations', 'Amazon', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'local', 'store', 'boy', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'what', 'was', 'missing', ""'re"", 'Star', 'Wars', 'fan', 'partial', 'weird', 'west', 'cartoons', 'Trigun', 'Bravestarr', 'more', 'recent', 'Gun', 'X', 'Sword', 'lapped', 'up', 'PC', 'game', 'Privateer', 'decade', 'ago', 'Firefly', 'must-see', 'TV', 'also', 'venerable', 'Star', 'Trek', 'franchise', 'crew', 'dropped', 'mostly', 'situations', 'voyages', 'However', 'Firefly', 'witty', 'characterizations', 'uncontrived', 'plot', 'twists', 'brisk', 'pacing', 'energy.I', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'plots', 'mostly', 'covered', 'editorial', 'customer', 'reviews', 'one', 'thing', 'noticed', 'Firefly', 'series', 'refreshing', 'lack', 'space', 'battles', 'fact', 'ship', 'Serenity', 'guns', 'major', 'twist', 'space-based', 'TV', 'shows.The', 'show', 'geek', 'notes', 'right', 'way', 'roguish', 'crew', 'evil', 'corporations', 'criminal', 'lowlifes', 'even', 'lesbian', 'kissing', 'almost', 'Han', 'Solo', 'Series', 'better.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'way', 'way', 'excellent', 'Aside', 'humorous', 'enlightening', 'commentaries', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'aforementioned', 'final', 'three', 'episodes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel', 'One', 'caveat', 'parents', 'Firefly', 'sex', 'scenes', 'can', 'not', 'label', 'suggested', 'sex', 'scenes', 'can', 'see', 'doing', 'clearly', 'other', 'way', 'can', 'interpret', 'otherwise', 'hey', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'other', 'scenes', 'sensitive', 'nature', 'violence', 'part', 'surprisingly', 'tame', 'standards', 'even', 'torture', 'scenes', 'substantial', 'chunk', 'series.Overall', 'seeing', 'series', 'will', 'wonder', 'were', 'Fox', 'executives', 'thinking', 'when', 'cancelled', 'excellent', 'series', 'Firefly', 'Good', 'thing', 'DVD', 'movie', 'franchises', 'make', 'up', 'capriciousness', 'ignorance', 'network', 'executives']",N/A
765775,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B0000AQS0F,,"[13, 14]","I had never heard of this series. I ordered the DVD set on a lark. I have always like Science Fiction and have looked for film/video adaptations. I have usually been disappointed but I keep trying. Finding a gem like this one makes the effort worth while.The basic premise is of the crew of a tramp freighter who make their way by carrying freights, the occasional smuggling job and a few other less than legal operation. These are invariably conducted against people who deserve to have been on the losing side. The captain and first mate are old war buddies. They were both on the losing side of a civil war. The mate is married to the ships pilot. The ship's engineer is a sweet, somewhat nave and technically competent young lady. A tough, mercenary type rounds out the regular crew.In the first episode, they take on a series of passengers. One of them is a ""shepherd"", which is a sort of itinerant Christian priest. He has a mysterious past we never really learn about. A brother and sister also come on board. The brother is a highly skilled surgeon and the sister is a genius who had secret experiments run on her by government agents. They are on the run from the same government agents. The other ""permanent"" passenger is a courtesan. She leases one of the ship's shuttles as her place of business. While the crew is doing their thing, she does hers.Much of this series seems like a cowboy picture, right down to the horses, saloons and brothels. In a strange way, it works well in the context of the series. It is well done. I am very sorry that the series was cancelled because it is very good.Synopses of the episodes appear below:Serenity - the crew of the Serenity agrees to pick up a less than legal cargo but gets stiffed on their fee when they try to deliver it. Unless they can find somewhere to sell it, they won't have the cash for parts, fuel, salary or anything else. So they try to less it on some border areas. To help pay the way, they take on some passengers also. One of the passengers turns out to be smuggling a fugitive and another is a federal agent sent to bring in everyone. I get the impression that the government types are not very nice. When you throw in a courtesan, some cannibals and a preacher, things get interesting.The Train Job - This one seems more like a western but doesn't suffer from that. The crew is hired to rob a train on a frontier planet. The goods they are hired to purloin belong to the Federation government so no one really minds or things it is ""wrong"". They also enjoy doing the job right under the noses of Federation troops. The crew doesn't really know what they are stealing. It is only when the train gets to it destination that they learn that they have stolen desperately needed medical supplies. The leads the crew to try to return the goods without getting caught by the feds or the crime boss they were doing job for. This is to be done while the crew is still be pursued by the secret government agency from whom one of the passengers escaped. It's a good and exciting episode.Bushwhacked - While doing nothing in particular, the crew of the Serenity encounter a derelict floating in space. When they go aboard, they find that the crew has been slaughtered by the Reevers (cannibal lunatics) mentioned in the first episode. They left one survivor and a valuable cargo. The crew attempts to help the survivor and salvage the cargo but their efforts are interrupted by a Federation ship. The captain of that ship assumes that it is the crew of the Serenity who committed the atrocities. The crew have to protect themselves, establish their innocence and hide the fugitives who have become passengers.Shindig - The crew returns to the planet Persephone, where the series started. They are looking for business opportunities as usual and a possibility pops up. The captain sees an opportunity for a smuggling run and goes to make contact at a fancy party hosted by the local gentry. To keep this episode interesting, Innarra, the staff courtesan has a date with a local bigwig. He and the captain have a bit of a tiff and wind up in a duel...with swords. There is not a lot of call for swords on spaceships.Safe - In seems that nothing can go right. The crew of the Serenity make planetfall with the consignment of cattle they picked up in the last episode and are about to collect their payment. Then things go wrong as they inevitably must. The local law shows up to arrest the cattle buyers just as the money is changing hands and the crew get involved in the shootout. They help out the law but the parson gets himself shot...very seriously shot. The only two missing from the scene are the two fugitives who have wandered off. The captain thinks they might get in the way of the deal making but now the doctor's services are needed. Unfortunately, he and his sister have gotten themselves kidnapped by some religious types who live in the hills. They are glad to have the doctor but they think the sister is a witch and must burn. Saving the preacher and rescuing the siblings proves to be a sticky situation.Our Mrs. Reynolds - Somehow, we don't really know how, the crew of the Serenity find themselves helping a rural community defend themselves from bandits. After the big celebration, the crew get back on board take of and find that they have an extra passenger. It seems that, according to the local customs, the captain has gotten himself married. That is news to everyone. The young girl is seemingly nave but she is not what she seems. Someone wants the Serenity for scrap.Jaynestown - Jayne Cobb is perhaps the least likeable member of the Serenity crew. He is selfish, not too bright and always ready to fight. He has a long history of leaving planets behind while being on the run. In this episode, the crew sets down to pick up an illicit cargo and Jayne is worried because he knows he left the place on the run. He adopts a disguise. Much to everyone's surprise, everyone learns that Jayne Cobb has become a folk hero to the people on the planet complete with a statue in the public square. All of this came about because of a misunderstanding. He never intended to help those people; he did it by accident but he is still a hero. Heroes have people who don't like them and on this planet that include the local magistrate.Out of Gas - Most series wait until at least the second season before having a retrospective episode. This one takes place halfway through the first season but it has a difference. Instead of recycling footage from old episodes this one has all new footage. The situation involves a serious mechanical failure while the ship is in transit. Life support is failing and the captain sends his crew off in the two shuttles while he stays aboard to try and fix things. While this is going on, we are treated to flashback showing how the crew came to be assembled.Ariel - When the mysterious female passenger with mental problems starts getting worse, her brother the doctor comes up with a seemingly simple scheme to serve everyone's needs. The crew is to help the doc smuggle sis into a hospital for some tests and the doc agrees to help them steal some high dollar drugs to sell on the fringe planets. These are not recreational pharmaceuticals but vital medicines in short supply. The plan seems to work smoothly until treachery becomes apparent.War Stories - In the second episode, the crew is hired to pull a train heist. They pull it off but, when all is said and done, they find that they don't want to keep the goods. The natives need the stolen medications more than the crew needs the money. This is all good and noble and such but it hacks of the crime boss who put them up to it. The crew returned the money but the boss wants revenge. In this episode, he manages to capture the captain and the pilot. It is up to the rest of the crew to get them out.Trash - A few episodes back, the captain got himself accidentally married. The blushing bride turned out to be a con woman and they only barely got away with their lives and their ship. This time, at a Smuggler rendezvous, the captain runs into an old war buddy who happens to have gotten himself married to the same piece of trash. When the story comes out, the wife gets stranded. Captain Mal is about to strand her as well but she manages to talk him into one of her schemes. Naturally, the ""lady"" has an angle of her own. Make that lots of angles...and curves...and treachery. The crew has a few ideas of their own but nothing is going to go as planned.The Message - When the crew stops at a station for a mail call, they get a surprise. A corpse has been mailed to the captain and Zo. The corpse turns out to be an old war buddy. His last request is that the Serenity take him home for burial. Things are not as they seem, however. The corpse is not dead. Instead, he is smuggling body parts and there are other who want the parts, without the rest of the body. As everyone turns on everyone else over conflicting loyalties, the situation gets tense.Heart of Gold - When Inarra, the courtesan, gets a distress call, she talks the crew of Serenity into helping an old friend of hers who is the madam of a bordello on a backwater planet. A local powerbroker with a barren wife want to sire an heir on one of the house girls. He manages to plant his crop and intends to claim it by force. The crew intend to prevent that. And a good time is had by most.Objects in Space - River, the female fugitive, continues to get more and more erratic. This troubles the crew who fear not only for themselves but for her as well. Things are not helped in that there is a very large reward for her capture. This tends to promote suspicion with many of the people with which they deal. In this episode, a bounty hunter manages to sneak aboard and waylay the crew one by one. River, though, is not without her own methods.",5,Cowboys and Spacemen,1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,9879,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'series', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'set', 'lark', 'have', 'always',

I finished watching all the episodes and Special Features from the DVDs last night. All i have to say is wow...I mean seriously, wow. I thought after watching Battlestar Galactica that nobody could ever make a compelling lifelike show with a space theme in it.Firefly definately lives up to the hype. Once i started with the first episode Serenity, also the name of the upcoming movie in September of this year, I was hooked. To sum it up the series background is a twist of western and space. Sounds corny? It's not. To make a better analogy in my mind is that the Human race is heavily colonizing planets and thusly has a ""Go West young man"" feel.As Joss Whedon summarized in the Special Features ""It's about throwing nine people into space on their own and getting nine different perspectives of what that would be like"". The background of the world is never overwhelming in the sense this series is first and foremost about the characters. It gets to the point where you don't care about the cool space stuff or planets, but what is going to happen to each person next. What can I say about the cast...amazing casting. Each person is just perfect for the role. I won't really say too much about the characters other than they are all very well-tailored and unique and throughout the 14 episodes you get on this DVD collection you will see each one fleshed out well and clammering for more. If you aren't convinced about the reviews here you can catch it on Sci-Fi channel at 7pm EST. Sci-Fi is rebroadcasting the series mostly in part due to the upcoming Serenity release.It is truly a shame this series ended so soon. It had all the qualities of a great TV series.

If you're reading this then you already know that Firefly was a short lived Western-themed TV sci-fi series... and that this description hardly begins to describe it as a show.The eternal debate among ""fanboys"" is over which show is best. Is it B5 with its story arc? Is it BSG with its relentless darkness? Is it Farscape? Doctor Who? Trek? Blake's 7?  In that debate, Firefly, with a mere 14 episodes, has to be seriously considered. Cut off before it really got going, we'll never really know what the series would have been... but we are left with an amazing mini-series that is eminently watchable. Each episode, in fact, is a nifty piece of television--I'm one of the few that found and watched Firefly in its original run, where the story arc made no sense because the episodes were shown out of order.There is humor here and there is some poignancy. But what always strikes me is the sense of realism that was forged. The sets and effects are not what I'm talking about: it's the characters. For example, in the (intended) first episode (Serenity), the captain makes a series of decisions that result in the doctor remaining on board. But each of these decisions is utterly real: the captain really would have killed him if one of the other characters had died. And late in the episode he plays a practical joke on the doctor by telling her she's died which is pitch perfect. It is a mark of pure craftsmanship that good writing and characterization runs through every episode.So I got tired of Tivoing the re-runs on the Sci Fi Channel and ordered up the DVDs. They're nicely packaged and you'll enjoy them many times over.

Now, that I finally bought me the Blu rendition, I can say that Firefly in Blu is, definitely... a SMALL improvement over the DVD and I am not sure that the slightly better DTS HD 5.1 sound and the marginally brighter, clearer picture can justify paying twice for Firefly.Personally, I am not unhappy with my purchase. The Blu version IS better and I already gave the DVD away to a friend. Not everybody may agree that the this edition's improvements are worth getting it.Briefly:- Contentwise, a couple of extras were added to whatever was inherited from the DVD edition, everything nicely squeezed on 3 discs.- Packaging is pretty neat, not much thicker than a one-disc Blu box.- As I mentioned already, the sound gets a clear upgrade with DTS HD 5.1.- I agree with the other reviewers that the CGI appears fuzzier than the rest of the content, probably because they were produced by the computer on a resolution lower than 1080. This makes the CGI objects to 'stand out' clearly and visibly on top of the 'real world' filmed backgrounds and they do so more than in the DVD version where they are seamless. Luckily, there's not A LOT of CGI in Firefly.- The non-CGI content is of a better quality but, clearly, the original producers had to make do with a rather tight budget and I suspect that they couldn't afford the very best in cameras and image processing.In the end, I might have splurged on this purchase with no very good or easy to defend reasons but it's good to know that at least a little change off what I paid is going to end up in the pockets of those nice people involved in making this too short-lived but already a classic TV series.",4,"Incrementally better than the DVD, some extra content, improved sound",1246060800,"06 27, 2009",2009,1765,"['Needless', 'say', 'Firefly', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'series', 'needless', 'say', 'already', 'own', 'DVD', 'version', 'Now', 'finally', 'bought', 'Blu', 'rendition', 'can', 'say', 'Firefly', 'Blu', 'definitely', 'SMALL', 'improvement', 'DVD', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'slightly', 'better', 'DTS', 'HD', '5.1', 'sound', 'marginally', 'brighter', 'clearer', 'picture', 'can', 'justify', 'paying', 'twice', 'Firefly.Personally', 'am', 'not', 'unhappy', 'purchase', 'Blu', 'version', 'IS', 'better', 'already', 'gave', 'DVD', 'away', 'friend', 'Not', 'everybody', 'may', 'agree', 'edition', 'improvements', 'are', 'worth', 'getting', 'it.Briefly', 'Contentwise', 'couple', 'extras', 'were', 'added', 'was', 'inherited', 'DVD', 'edition', 'everything', 'nicely', 'squeezed', '3', 'discs.-', 'Packaging', 'pretty', 'neat', 'not', 'much', 'thicker', 'one-disc', 'Blu', 'box.-', 'mentioned', 'already', 'sound', 'clear', 'upgrade', 'DTS', 'HD', '5.1.-', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'CGI', 'fuzzier', 'rest', 'content', 'probably', 'were', 'produced', 'computer', 'resolution', 'lower', '1080', 'CGI', ""'stand"", 'out', 'clearly', 'visibly', 'top', ""'real"", 'world', 'filmed', 'backgrounds', 'do', 'so', 'more', 'DVD', 'version', 'where', 'are', 'seamless', 'Luckily', 'not', 'A', 'LOT', 'CGI', 'Firefly.-', 'non-CGI', 'content', 'better', 'quality', 'clearly', 'original', 'producers', 'had', 'make', 'do', 'rather', 'tight', 'budget', 'suspect', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'very', 'best', 'cameras', 'image', 'processing.In', 'end', 'might', 'have', 'splurged', 'purchase', 'very', 'good', 'easy', 'defend', 'reasons', 'good', 'know', 'least', 'little', 'change', 'what', 'paid', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'pockets', 'nice', 'people', 'involved', 'making', 'too', 'short-lived', 'already', 'classic', 'TV', 'series']",N/A

765787,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0000AQS0F,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[38, 43]","Firefly is like no other television program.  Only lasting one year, with episodes randomly thrown on strange nights on FOX, this series boasted a classic combination of science fiction with a western flair.  How could it go wrong?  A humorous program that had fun, fought bad guys, and harbored extremely dark secrets.  Why did it only last one season?  Marketing.  FOX, as we all can learn from my review of Outfoxed, is not quite the ""fair and balanced"" type of programming that it promotes, but instead attaches itself to the hottest trend and pushes it nearly to the point of sickness.  For those that would disagree, I ask you to check out how many predictable seasons of American Idol we will have to endure until someone realizes that it lost its steam a many a moon ago.  Or how about the disaster of a series called Wife Swap?  Honestly, did FOX just ignore the idea of creativity and push directly for insulting ""reality"" television?  From what I see on television today, I could only assume the answer to be ""yes"".  Firefly was a bold, unique, and highly original series that gave us powerful characters, detailed stories, and that Lost itch in the back of your mind that keeps you asking that age old question, ""why"".  Yet, in all of its power, it was cancelled.Firefly is perfection on a stick.  The twang of the guitar, the stone-face stare of Mal, the goofiness of Jayne (is that a girls name?), the questionable past of Shepard Book, the humor of Wash, the power of Zoe, and the innocence of Kaylee is exactly why I fell in love with this show.  This is honestly, one of the few series that I could go back from the beginning and watch again, loving every moment of it.  Whedon created a masterpiece in my eyes, and a huge opportunity was missed by several major networks to keep this imagination alive.While some will argue that Firefly was full of nothing more than C-rated actors who were ""shallow cut-outs, and whose dialogue never rises above the level of a so-so sitcom"", I thought that they brought so much personality and charisma to a smorgasbord of unoriginal programming. I wanted to know the truth behind River and the darkness behind the good Shepard.  I continually waited for a snappy comeback from Mal, and was excited whenever he showed humility.  Jayne was a big favorite of mine, always questioning authority, yet as loyal as the family dog.  The love between Zoe and Wash brought a new layer of honesty to this sci-fi series.  It wasn't just about paying for the ship, flying through unmapped terrain, or stealing, it was about humanity.  That sense of humanity could be found in the opening episode for this series aptly titled ""Serenity"".  In it, the crew takes upon some passengers with some rather unknown cargo.  Inside one of those crates is a girl that will change their lives forever.  For this series to work successfully, as it did, we needed human characters that bled, felt compassion, and demonstrated connectiveness to each of us.  Mal's ship, Serenity, was a living example of how television could be done creatively and originally.The characters could only be as strong as the words that were handed to them.  Listening to the words that pass through Mal's mouth, the charm of Wash, or even the inconsistent ramblings of River, you could only wonder where Whedon could have gone with all of them.  In each of these characters, Whedon had written secrets.  While, sadly, we may never know what they all were, that is what made you itch for more episodes.  You not only wanted to see the creative ""western"" adventures that Whedon was sending his crew, but you also wanted to learn more about these band of renegades.  They were good, but possibly darkness reigned inside of them.  The character most guilty of this (outside of River) was Shepard Book.  I loved this character.  Whedon drew him with so much passion and conviction, yet with every episode you learned more about this man than imaginable.  He is an excellent example of what this series was like.  He represented the smart words of Whedon, the humanity of his character, and the secrets that each of these shared.  He was a ""priest"", yet he knew more about the Alliance than anyone aboard that ship.  If anyone were to ask me to describe the series in two words, I would simply say, ""Shepard Book"".George Lucas is credited with creating this detailed futuristic world that gives us glimpses of a possible future, or a galaxy far far away, Whedon succeeded in this series by giving us a plausible future in the not-too-distant future of 500 years.  Prostitution in legal, in fact respected in the community, the Chinese and Americans have forged one super power called the Alliance, and our hero is a war veteran, still not shaken by the loss that his side took due to the Alliance control.  While Lucas gives us far-fetched characters and situations, Whedon gives us a imaginative look at our future.  I think that is why this series worked so well for me.  I could imagine this future.  I could see it past the characters.  I wasn't bogged down by dopey looking aliens, but instead a plausible man vs. man situation.  Firefly was simple, yet so complex.I could honestly go on forever about how much I enjoyed this show.  I have never watched a series where I found myself prepared to watch over and over again. Firefly blends a power mixture of comedy, western, and action all together ... and the characters bleed.  Villains die in this series.  How often do you see that?

We stayed home on Friday nights or we exercised our VCRs and TiVos.  We took it on faith that, just as Buffy did not turn out to be 90210 with vampires, so too would this not turn out to be the Lone Ranger with spaceships, and we were right to do so.  It was witty and charming, fun and interesting.  After a few episodes, we gave a damn about the characters.  It had the potential to be another Buffy for Joss Whedon.  In my opinion, it already was.  Alas, it was science fiction, very expensive to produce when produced as well as Firefly was, and not geared to appeal to the lowest common denominator, so in tough economic times it was cancelled in favor of inexpensive and popular reality television.If you like Joss Whedon's other work, buy these DVDs and watch every episode.  Even though you'll lack closure in the end, you'll be glad you did.  Try it, you'll understand.  Then join the rest of us in wishing Joss luck getting a Firefly movie off the ground.",5,What a loss.

Intelligent folks or at least folks who want to sound intelligent are always disparaging the ""junk"" on TV. To be sure they have a point. With the proliferartion of garbage on the box it's easy to overlook a real gem in a sea of manure.Firefly is that gem.I never got to see the show when it was broadcast and I guess I should be thankful for that. Had I discovered it and gotten hooked only to have it yanked out from under me would have been an extreme disappointment. At least now when I bought the DVD set I knew it was finite and limited so I cherished each episode that much more.Firefly is the most imaginative television show ever broadcast. It was intelligent, fun, funnny, touching and poignant. The ensemble cast had to be the best fit with each other I've ever seen, and the writing, oh the writing. Any episode would have worthy of a full length motion picture, and better than 95% of the motion pictures out there.I watched the series on disk at a rate of one per day until the third disk. Then I stopped and went at it on per week to extend the experience until the inevitable end.The series is difficult to classify. Is it a Sc-Fi/Western as others have described? Maybe, but that simple description seems inadequate to understanding Firefly in all it's nuances.I think it is a celebration of freedom more than anything. All human desires distilled into a form that is at once entertaining and profound.I am not sure of FOX's motivation for even producing it to begin with since if it fulfilled it's promise it would have had to been exactly what the network claimed it was and the reaosn for cancelling it to begin with. They said it was too deep or two complex for the average viewer. Well boys, that had to be obvious before putting the first scene to film. Had that been the case the show would have never been authorized to begin with.So we have a mystery. No matter. It's limit is also what makes it more valuable.

There is a strong ensemble cast and a strong plot premise.Firefly is set 500 years in the future.  In this future it is more like the Wild Wild West than the Jetsons.  Illnesses like diabetes are present and cat gut surgery are used to treat injury.  Any future in depth space exploration would be for resources and colonization.  It also shows the prevailing earth power in the future would be authoritarian with the Chinese prevalent.  In the Alliance they have the Prime worlds as shown in the episode ""Ariel"" and in flashbacks to River's childhood.  These worlds are what you may see in ""Star Trek"" or pre occupation Caprica on BSG.  The outer worlds have a lower standard of living.  This does make sense.  In the 17th century North America and South America were dependent on shipments from the Old World(readThe Winthrop Woman: A NovelThe Winthrop Woman by Anya Seton)just as a comparison.If you like more emphasis on technology this may not be the show for you.  This show is character driven.  Some reviewers fault the science for being dodgy but this is true of ALL of the sci-fi series.  This show is also short on idealism as exhibited in shows like Star Trek or Star Wars.All of the episodes have something to recommend them.  The series raises interesting questions about the Reavers and River Tamm.  The movie SerenitySerenity (Widescreen Edition)is recommended as a follow up for that.In summary, Firefly, the series is an excellent ensemble drama in the tradition of Star Trek and Star Wars(liking one doesn't mean that you have to dislike the others).",5,Firefly,1190764800,"09 26, 2007",2007,1626,"['great', 'sci-fi/futuristic', 'fantasy', 'series', 'strong', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'strong', 'plot', 'premise.Firefly', 'set', '500', 'years', 'future', 'future', 'more', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'Jetsons', 'diabetes', 'are', 'present', 'cat', 'gut', 'surgery', 'are', 'used', 'treat', 'injury', 'future', 'depth', 'space', 'exploration', 'would', 'be', 'resources', 'colonization', 'also', 'prevailing', 'earth', 'power', 'future', 'would', 'be', 'authoritarian', 'Chinese', 'prevalent', 'Alliance', 'have', 'Prime', 'worlds', 'shown', 'episode', 'Ariel', 'flashbacks', 'River', 'childhood', 'worlds', 'are', 'what', 'may', 'see', 'Star', 'Trek', 'pre', 'occupation', 'Caprica', 'BSG', 'outer', 'worlds', 'have', 'lower', 'standard', 'living', 'make', 'sense', '17th', 'century', 'North', 'America', 'South', 'America', 'were', 'dependent', 'shipments', 'Old', 'World', 'readThe', 'Winthrop', 'Woman', 'NovelThe', 'Winthrop', 'Woman', 'Anya', 'Seton', 'just', 'comparison.If', 'more', 'emphasis', 'technology', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'show', 'show', 'character', 'driven', 'reviewers', 'fault', 'science', 'being', 'dodgy', 'true', 'ALL', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'show', 'also', 'short', 'idealism', 'exhibited', 'shows', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Star', 'Wars.All', 'episodes', 'have', 'something', 'recommend', 'series', 'interesting', 'questions', 'Reavers', 'River', 'Tamm', 'movie', 'SerenitySerenity', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'recommended', 'follow', 'up', 'that.In', 'summary', 'Firefly', 'series', 'excellent', 'ensemble', 'drama', 'tradition', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Star', 'Wars', 'liking', 'one', ""n't"", 'mean', 'have', 'dislike', 'others']",N/A

765805,A1HNOGVSUXQR51,B0000AQS0F,"Amazon Customer ""Author""","[2, 2]","This show and its cast, writers, and crew deserve far more credit for this series and the film that came after it than was given them. The show was fresh and innovative, and yet bore a humble and lasting character reminiscent of old world values devoid in many of today's shows.These were characters refusing to live within the reign of a brilliant, yet repressive technocracy. They did all the things you might expect such outlaws to do, but with an underlying moral code that stood them out as unsung heroes rather than rag-tag hustlers.I am disappointed that no sequel appears to be in the works, but I for one applaud Nathan Fillion (Mal),Gina Torres (Zo), Alan Tudyk (Wash), Morena Baccarin (Inara), Adam Baldwin (Jayne), Jewel Staite (Kaylee), Sean Maher (Simon), Summer Glau (River), Ron Glass (Shephard Book), and Joss Whedon (Writer & Director) for making a wonderful show that our entire family still watches. We have bought the movie and the series, and they hold a special place in our collection.While we are on the subject, allow me to offer a bit of viewer praise for several aspects that I thought stood out in both the series and the film.Nathan Fillion's performance as Mal served as an enigma to me from the beginning. He was capable of making the hard choices to keep the ship and its primary crew safe even when the options were all unsavory. That quick and brutal hatchet of leadership made me wonder at first why anyone would serve with such a man. That was because I did not trust him, but as the series moved further along we viewers began to see the world through his eyes. We sampled in small doses the poison of this vile space empire and started to ask ourselves how anyone could NOT see the galaxy through Mal's perspective. Mal was such a strong character because his human frailty threatened to overwhelm him at any moment. He forced down that weakness and demanded better of himself, all the while with a wry humor that made him truly endearing.And Nathan Fillion played him. I'm not sure there's a better compliment for an actor out there.Adam Baldwin's ""Jayne"" is a refreshing distance from his usual upstanding, hard-nosed, straight-laced military officer type roles. Even his portrayal of Commander Casey on NBC's ""Chuck"" is no where near as lively and heart-felt as the rude, untrustworthy, and conniving Jayne. He is the living personification of the term ""mercenary"" and yet Adam never lets any of his former roles slip in. Jayne is always just one step away from total corruption. Jayne would have made the perfect nemesis for Mal except for two things; opportunity and wit.Joss Whedon, sir, this was a thoughtful hybrid genre that I never found overpowering. There was enough tech to keep one's feet firmly planted on the deck of the Serenity, and enough gun-slinging and damsel rescuing to keep its spirit of adventure alive. There was so much more to do with this show, so many avenues to explore, that this show could have gone almost ANYWHERE and been great. The writing was thoughtful, the dialogue well chosen and yet entirely believable. This cast was endearing and their work inspiring. You could feel that they loved working together, and that translated into a great show.I really enjoyed the show. If I had a billion dollars, I would not only invest in Serenity 2, but I would back it 100%.

It is nothing like Buffy or Angel, and I was not disappointed.  I'm under the impression that Joss Whedon can do no wrong when he is in charge.There are several things that make this show absolutely fabulous:1.  The characters.  There aren't too many shows that have character development that could surpass Firefly.  The characters work off of each other and you find yourself relating to them.  The actors and actresses who portray them are perfect.2.  The writing.  Joss Whedon, Tim Minear and an array of other wonderful writers have compiled some of the best scripts in television.  There are several episodes that are brilliantly written.  The story is incredible and has so much room to grow.3.  The acting.  The actors and actresses in this show, both regulars and guest stars give memorable performances.  There isn't a poor performance in the entire series.All in all, Firefly is an amazing show that would have been a ton of fun to follow for years.

When I first heard Firefly described as a cross between sci-fi and a western, I was a bit dubious, but I have never yet been disappointed and the shows remain fresh even with repeated viewings. I highly recommend the entire series for writing, acting and social commentary.In this particular episode, Mal takes care of a thief that has been preying on a small community and finds himself with a wife in payment.

765835,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0000AQS0F,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[9, 12]","Doesn't it seem odd that a show that failed would be put on DVD?  I thought so too, but I kept hearing good things about Firefly, and I am big fans of Joss Whedon's other shows, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, so I decided to see what it was like.  I couldn't be happier that I did because Firefly is definitely a great show that was killed before it could even begin to reach its full potential.  The show tells the story of nine people on the firefly class ship Serenity, which was named for a battle in a war for independence.  This battle was, for the most part, the last stand for Capt. Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his fellow Independents.  After this fight, victory seemed imminent for the Alliance, a government who wanted to unite all planets under one rule.  Mal and his friend and later first mate Zo (Gina Torres) wanted each planet to rule itself.  After the war, the pair bought Serenity and assembled a crew consisting of Wash (Alan Tudyk), the pilot and Zo's future husband, Kaylee (the beautiful Jewel Staite), the cheerful mechanic who definitely has elements of the Buffy character Willow (the also beautiful Alyson Hannigan), and Jayne (Adam Baldwin), who is kind of muscle for hire.  They also have Inara (Moreena Baccarin), who is a companion, which is the new term for prostitute.  Apparently, 500 years from now, prostitution will not only be legal, but it will be a respectful career.  She rents one of Serenity's two shuttles, and her presence is mutally beneficial to the crew and herself.  Her clientele is increased, and she opens some doors for Mal and the crew.  In fact, her nickname is the Ambassador.  The group will do anything to keep going; they will pick up passengers and do any job, legal or illegal.  Mal actually seems to prefer the illegal jobs just because it means thwarting the Alliance.  Then in the first episode (strangely, it was the one of the last ones aired), three new people join the crew.  There is Shepard Book (Ron Glass), the preacher and conscious of the ship, Dr. Simon Tam, and his insanely intelligent and intelligently insane (yes I know, that didn't make much sense) sister.  Simon and River are on the run from the Alliance; River, who is a genius, was sent to an academy run by the Blue Sun Corporation, which is heavily funded by the Alliance.  However, the acadamy turned out to be a lab facility where researchers did experiments on River.  She sent coded messages to Simon, and he had her cryogenically frozen, and then resuced her.  Now Mal and the crew have to deal with a crazy young girl who is a wanted fugitive.The writing and acting on the show are definitely worthy of Joss Whedon's name; in fact, after Firefly ended, Nathan Fillion and Gina Torres were cast in Buffy and Angel.  I loved this cast, especially Jewel Staite.  She was priceless!  I was so afraid that she was going to die in the first episode, and I was very relieved when she wasn't.  However, her situation allowed for one of the best scenes in the entire series; the thing that happened when Mal told Simon that she was dead was so funny.  Some of my favorite episodes include Serenity Pts. 1 and 2, The Train Job, Shindig, Ariel, Our Mrs. Reynolds, Trash, The Message, War Stories, and Objects In Space.  Oh, and speaking of characters in Joss Whedon's shows, did you see that, in Serenity, Carlos Jaccot, who played Dobson, also appeared as villains in Buffy and Angel (although in Angel, he wasn't really evil, despite the fact that he was a demon who wanted to eat Doyle's (Glenn Quinn) brains).Unfortunately, we may never know how much some of these characters will be developed.  In fact, there are so many things that we may never know; such as Book's origins; something was up with him.  He could shoot too well, and the bounty hunter, who may have been a little crazy, said without any doubt that he was no Shepard.  We also may never know what those blue-handed men from the Blue Sun actually did to River, and what they wanted her for.  The Simon/Kaylee and Mal/Inara relationships will never be fulfilled/revealed/destroyed, and we won't find out if Inara actually leaves.  I really hope that the Firefly movie gets made, so that we can see what happens next.  I would also like Fox to revive the show, the way that they are reviving Family Guy, because they lost a true gem when they cancelled Firefly.UpdateAs of August 7th, 2004, I have shown Firefly to four people who, like me had never seen it before.

And what a series -- fantastic and brilliant TV.This shortlived but brilliant show from Buffy creator Joss Whedon isn't just a series to rent, but one to own. It's just so richly textured -- every episode bears repetition, and brings on those funny, smart, sexy, and stylish moments so rare these days in the TV wasteland.""Firefly"" is set 500 years in the future and is a very witty and adventurous ""Sci-Fi Western"" in a future in which everything is a mix of American with a dash of Chinese thrown in.  And those of you making faces at ""oooh it's a Western"" (I was one of them) -- I promise you'll like it anyway, even if you're not always a John Wayne type. ;-)And even the special effects are fantastic -- a standout is a pulse-pounding chase from the terrifying Reavers in the two-hour pilot.  Everything looks feature-film slick.  It's great, smart Sci-Fi -- for instance, there is no sound in the space scenes (unlike the ""whooshes"" on Star Trek when the ship goes into hyperspace etc), because there is no sound in space.The characters are smart and brave and very funny, with a gorgeous and talented cast, and all 15 episodes are wonderful and offer a moment to savor.

765850,A22UW60T9HWOKW,B0000AQS0F,apeman505,"[6, 27]","I hate this show. There, I said it. I know a lot of people are going to hate on me for saying it, but it's the truth. I. DON'T. LIKE. FIREFLY. Now that you've probably already clicked ""unhelpful,"" please allow me to explain/vent.I'm sure you're aware, dear reader, of Firefly's immense popularity. Many of my friends recommended it to me, saying it was like Star Wars, except somehow better. Also, the internet made the show sound totally awesome, so I ordered the the complete series on blu-ray and when it came in the mail I IMMEDIATELY put it in my PS3 because I was so excited to watch it. However, my first impression of the show (other than it wasn't really at all like Star Wars) was that I didn't like the style of it at all. I think it was the country music theme song playing over the menu screen that put me off initially. I hate that theme song, it's horrible. Dude's got some sort of speech impediment. Anyway, then the pilot episode started and I can't say I found it anything but boring and waaay too long. Still, everyone did say the show was the best thing ever, and dagnabbit I was going to see what the hype was about. I forced myself to watch the rest of the first disk, but it took me a couple weeks because it kept getting harder and harder to make myself push that play button. After finishing that one disk I still can't bring myself to watch any more.Don't get me wrong, though, I love the premise of the show. I mean, space pirates and smugglers? Sign me up! Plus there are plenty of space westerns out there that I do love, like Star Wars, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, and Outlaw Star. Firefly is just... really badly done, though. It's like they made a cowboy show and shoehorned in spaceships and space-age technology, not even trying to make it seem logical or fluid. I mean, Joss Whedon even said the Reavers are supposed to be Apaches. SPACE APACHES. This sort of thing would be okay with a cartoon or something, but it just doesn't work for a serious live action show because all the space stuff seems out of place when they're on the ground, and all the cowboy stuff seems out of place when they're in space.So yeah, I honestly tried as hard as I could to get into the show but wound up hating it. That's okay, right? I'm allowed to dislike some things that other people do like, right? WRONG. If you dislike Firefly of all shows, everyone makes you keep watching it until you tell them you like it. ""Did you watch them in order?"" YES. ""Did you get to the one where--"" YES. ""You should try rewatching them, I'm sure you'll eventually 'get' it."" NO. It's like people can't believe that Firefly isn't perfect, just as I can't believe people actually enjoy it. What makes it even worse is the fact that you can't swing a dead internet around without tripping over some Firefly fanblog or T-shirt sale or facebook post touting it as the greatest work of art ever created, or condemning FOX for cancelling it when it wasn't getting enough ratings to warrant a second season (don't give me anything about `time slots' either, I hear no one even watched the Firefly marathon they played after it got cancelled!)... But I digress. If you haven't already been turned off by my negativity and want to keep reading I'll tell you exactly what it is I hate about Firefly.I think the main thing that really kills the show for me is the characters--I can't stand any of them, except the engineer. Allow me to enumerate.First you have Wash, the pilot. His quirk is that he plays with plastic dinosaurs. We're obviously supposed to find this hilarious, which I find insulting. The idea sounds funny on paper, but Wash comes off as annoying instead of funny. Robin Williams he is not.Wash is married to the first mate. If you've ever been in the same room as an over-affectionate couple that can't control themselves, then get ready for the same awkwardness because they're always talking about tearing each other's clothes off. When not conjuring up unsavory mental images, the first mate acts all tough and serious. I don't know what she sees in Wash because... well, look at him, he's an idiot. The first mate is actually kind of cool when she's not hitting on her husband, so I think they should've made her captain instead of the other guy.Then there's this guy who isn't the first mate but apparently carries the same authority. He looks and acts like a friggin' criminal, and nobody in the crew likes him. I remember in one episode the captain asks this man if he would ever accept money to assassinate him, to which he answered yes. He also tried to abandon the captain and first mate on some planet while stealing command of the ship for himself at one point. Why would anyone would keep this person in their crew, let alone give him a place in the chain of command? If I was the captain I'd fire him and take his guns away, if not push him out the airlock. Or, y'know, just not hire him to begin with.There's also (for some reason) a space hooker, called a 'Companion.' She, being a prostitute, is inexplicably given VIP treatment wherever she goes. She is sometimes used as a plot device, but otherwise contributes nothing to the show and annoys the crap out of me, especially with her 'I Dream of Jeannie' wardrobe. I think she and the captain have some sort of attraction going on or something, but they can't do anything about it because space prostitutes are like royalty in this universe.Then we have a priest named Book. I kind of like the priest, but the captain's always yelling at him and I hate that.OH GOOD GRIEF then there is an annoying doctor and his even more annoying stowaway sister, River. The doctor WILL NOT STOP WHINING, and River is worse!Now, before I'd seen Firefly the internet told me that River was awesome, and she was probably the number one reason why I wanted to watch the show. I had seen a picture of her with swords in a karate pose on the internet and was excited to see her in action. Imagine my disappointment when I got halfway through the series and all she's done so far is cry and babble nonsense. I was seriously pissed off, I felt like I was a victim of false advertising. She probably starts doing cool stuff by the end of the show, but I'll probably never watch to find out. I have yet to hear her say one complete sentence, even though she's supposed to be some sort of prodigy.Next there's the engineer, the only character I do like. She is bubbly and friendly and is the only character that isn't rude to all the other characters. Oh, and they make you think she dies at the end of the pilot episode! I was like, ""WHAT?! Did they just kill off the ONLY character I like?!"" Yeah, the captain just walks up and tells the audience she's dead ...and then you see her alive and he's like, ""April Fools, she's alive!""  HOW HILARIOUS. Up until that point, the captain had been absolutely nothing but grouchy-serious and the last thing I expected was a joke out of him, not that tricking people into thinking someone is dead qualifies as a 'joke.' Good grief, that pissed me off so much I started yelling at the TV, and I almost stopped watching the show because she's the only thing that made it almost tolerable. Imagine if someone pulled a prank like that in real life? The captain is such a friggin' psycho.Which brings me to the captain himself. The internet told me he was a funny, quirky, lovable rogue with a heart of gold, and he was my number two reason for wanting to see Firefly after River. I gotta say though, I hate him. He's absolutely nothing like how I heard. He's always all dark and moody, and he yells at Book just for being a priest EVERY TIME HE SEES HIM. I mean, isn't Book a paying customer?! Who yells at a paying customer?! What an awful character!What I REALLY hate about the captain, however, is that he doesn't even play his character consistently. Usually he's grouchy and moody, being a jerk to almost everyone else. Then, after he's worked up a huge amount of dislike from me, he will unexpectedly make a lighthearted joke and then immediately go back to being a grouchy douche. This happens maybe once every episode, and it really bothers me because the jokes not only seem out of character but whenever he makes them my reaction is, ""Did ... did he just make a joke?? He's not allowed to ... you're not allowed to be funny! You're a jerk, captain!"" (I actually yelled this at the TV while watching.) If he was ALWAYS that lighthearted and quirky I would probably like him, but instead it just feels like the writers couldn't decide on what kind of character to write.Speaking of the writing, I remember yelling at the TV quite a lot about the idiocy going on in some of the episodes. For instance, we have the Reavers. I'll grant that the Reavers are a cool concept--they're a bunch of castaways that got Space Madness like in Ren and Stimpy--but if you think about it, these people have space rabies, so wouldn't they just all kill each other instead of giving themselves prison piercings and acting like Animal from the Muppets? What makes these violent crazy people say, ""We'll kill, rape, and eat people as long as they're NOT Reavers?"" And how can these completely irrational human beings pilot something as sophisticated as a spaceship? Plus I find it hard to believe that simply seeing a Reaver doing Reaver stuff is enough make you to go crazy and become one of them.Also, the people on all the planets they visit are impossibly backward. There are SPACESHIPS in this universe, how are there people that still believe in witchcraft?! Is there no internet or education in the future? It just pushes all suspension of disbelief out the window! (They even dress like they're in Little House on the Prairie, for Pete's sake! MAN, I hate that!) And how does the captain, with ABSOLUTELY NO SWORDFIGTHING EXPERIENCE, kill an expert fencer in a swordfighting duel? He doesn't even cheat to win! Speaking from experience it's just not possible, but come to think of it, why are there still swordfighting duels in the space age?! Haven't they invented more civilized (or at least more hi-tech) means of settling disputes by now? How stupid does the captain have to be in order to get in a fight to the death with an expert swordsman over the honor of a SPACE PROSTITUTE?! It's mind boggling!Then there's the awful dialogue--everyone's always mean to each other, and I hate that. Not only do I not want to watch it, but it just feels like they injected arguments into the show as a feeble attempt at making the characters more believable. (And then after it's established that everyone hates each other, they show everyone playing basketball together in their spare time as though they're best buddies. I was like, ""What?!"") Anyway, besides the unlikable characters, the dialogue has to be the biggest reason why I can't stand this show.Also, all the storylines are lousy. That train episode kept making me think of FF8, and then there's another episode about ballroom dancing (of all things) that was completely boring and stupid. (Why were they all dressed in Elizabethan clothes in the future?! That's not even fitting with the Western/Sci-fi theme of the show!) And another episode was about a space version of the Crucible that didn't make any sense. Okay, so first River says something about a mute child talking to her, and then for some reason the villagers' immediate assumption was that River is a witch?? Then they were going to burn River and her brother on a stake, even though they kidnapped the brother because he's a doctor they're in desperate need of! And then the captain, who doesn't even know the doctor is in trouble, comes to rescue them even though it's established that he hates the doctor! The reason the captain gives for rescuing the doctor is that he's ""part of the crew."" No, captain, he's a passenger that everyone on board hates, and his sister is a stowaway that the police are after. Plus, the doctor jumped ship voluntarily because he was stupid, and I don't think that it's ever explained how they knew the villagers were going to burn them. I remember being angry most of the time while I was watching this show, and wondering just how anyone could like it because the writing was so bad.That being said, the special effects are actually pretty friggin' good for a television show. Color me impressed. I don't like the spaceship designs, though. I think the Serenity looks like they took an average looking spaceship, put a big red light on its tail end, and then stepped on it to make it crooked. It bugs me every time I look at it. I've heard people complain that the guns in this show look like old west guns but shoot lasers, but to be honest I didn't even notice.Overall, maybe I'm being too harsh. I don't suppose it's a TERRIBLE show, I just can't stand it personally. There were two parts I did kind of like--the part where the captain kicks some dude into an engine, and the part where the engineer was talking about spaceships with random guys at the ballroom dance. The rest of the show I can do without. I dunno, maybe Firefly just didn't live up to my expectations, or maybe being constantly reminded that it exists has made me jaded. I don't suppose it deserved to be cancelled based on its merits (I think CSI is a hundred times worse), but I also doubt it would have reached the popularity it currently enjoys had it not been for the scandal surrounding its cancellation. Anyway, I could never give a show I hate this much anything more than one star, so bring on the haters.",1,"Huge disappointment, didn't live up to the hype",1397174400,"04 11,

I didn't have high expectations but after the first episode (Serenity Part 1 and 2) I was blown away. This show combines a western feel (and music) with sci-fi, drama, humor, sex appeal, and a unique originality that cements it as a very entertaining and enjoyable show. Every character has a story to tell along with the many ships, races, and planets. I urge everyone who is a fan to call, write, or e-mail creator/writer Joss Wheadon to bring this show back in some form on any network, perhaps the Sci-Fi Channel (would be a perfect home if Fox wouldn't take it back). If not a revival of the show, at least give the fans another movie! The fact that the movie Serenity was even made after the shows cancellation speaks volumes...how many shows do you know of were given a movie after only 11 aired episodes? At the time of writing this, Firefly has been in Amazon's top 100 bestsellers for over 215 days!! It's currently number 1 under Fox TV, sci-fi and fantasy TV, and sci-fi series too! Fox messed this show up when it originally aired by moving time slots, airing episodes out of order, and not giving it a good promotion...thus not even giving the show a real chance. May I remind you all that the show Family Guy was canceled by Fox but the fans who bought the DVDs loved it so much that they demanded its return and look what happened...it worked! The same can hold true for Firefly if we all make the extra effort to show our support. This is one of the best shows I've ever seen and it deserves a second chance.

765856,A20UJP1JSTIOL6,B0000AQS0F,artanis65,"[7, 7]","There's so little that's good on television now that any halfway decent show stands out.  So it's hard to be objective about a show like ""Firefly.""  However, I am convinced that Firefly is such a brilliant genre-defining show it would shine in any era, and that science fiction fans will still be watching and talking about this show in thirty or forty years as we do about the original Star Trek today.When I first heard that Joss Whedon was doing a sci-fi Western, I looked forward to it.  I thought ""that's great; he's figured out that Science Fiction is the successor genre to the Western.""  Both offer limitless possibilities for adventure and action.  It's no coincidence that the popularity of westerns faded around the time movie science fiction started to become popular.  One genre looks back; the other looks ahead.  But I hadn't guessed that Whedon would put the two together quite literally.  One criticism the show gets is the unlikelihood of high and low technology existing together.  I'm sure Whedon has read his Robert Heinlein (Tunnel in the Sky, Farmer in the Sky), and low technology makes sense on a frontier world where there's not much money for power.  (They don't use modern tractors for farming in many parts of the world even today - they use horses and oxen.)  Firefly combines well thought out, logically coherent world building with the adventure and sense of wonder offered by the best space opera.The dialogue, special effects, acting, and even the music is top notch.  The worst you can say about the series is that the plotting in some of the episodes is fairly pedestrian.  If you watch the extras, you get the sense that the cast, especially Nathan Fillion who clearly has a deep appreciation of what Whedon is doing, knew that it was part of something special.  The attention to detail is stunning.  Several of the episodes are among the best television I've ever seen - the last half hour of the pilot ""Serenity"" just moves, and Out of Gas, and Objects in Space.  Most of the episodes are worth seeing more than once.Here's hoping the upcoming Serenity movie lives up the show's quality and becomes a success and that we get several more Serenity movies.  And here's hoping that the money people in Hollywood give Joss Whedon carte blanche to do what he wants in the future.  He's the rare talent who can transform genre fiction into art.",5,genre defining show,1090972800,"07 28, 2004",2004,2377,"['so', 'little', 'good', 'television', 'now', 'halfway', 'decent', 'show', 'out', 'hard', 'be', 'objective', 'show', 'Firefly', 'However', 'am', 'convinced', 'Firefly', 'such', 'brilliant', 'genre-defining', 'show', 'would', 'shine', 'era', 'science', 'fiction', 'fans', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'watching', 'talking', 'show', 'thirty', 'forty', 'years', 'do', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'today.When', 'first', 'heard', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'was', 'doing', 'sci-fi', 'Western', 'looked', 'forward', 'thought', 'great', 'figured', 'out', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'successor', 'genre', 'Western', 'offer', 'limitless', 'possibilities', 'adventure', 'action', 'coincidence', 'popularity', 'westerns', 'faded', 'time', 'movie', 'science', 'fiction', 'started', 'become', 'popular', 'One', 'genre', 'back', 'other', 'ahead', 'had', ""n't"", 'guessed', 'Whedon', 'would', 'put', 'two', 'together', 'quite', 'literally', 'One', 'criticism', 'show', 'unlikelihood', 'high', 'low', 'technology', 'existing', 'together', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Whedon', 'read', 'Robert', 'Heinlein', 'Tunnel', 'Sky', 'Farmer', 'Sky', 'low', 'technology', 'sense', 'frontier', 'world', 'where', 'not', 'much', 'money', 'power', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'modern', 'tractors', 'farming', 'many', 'parts', 'world', 'even', 'today', 'use', 'horses', 'Firefly', 'combines', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'logically', 'coherent', 'world', 'building', 'adventure', 'sense', 'wonder', 'offered', 'best', 'space', 'opera.The', 'dialogue', 'special', 'effects', 'acting', 'even', 'music', 'top', 'notch', 'worst', 'can', 'say', 'series', 'plotting', 'episodes', 'fairly', 'pedestrian', 'watch', 'extras', 'get', 'sense', 'cast', 'especially', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'who', 'clearly', 'deep', 'appreciation', 'what', 'Whedon', 'doing', 'knew', 'was', 'part', 'something', 'special', 'attention', 'detail', 'stunning', 'Several', 'episodes', 'are', 'best', 'television', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'pilot', 'Serenity', 'just', 'moves', 'Out', 'Gas', 'Objects', 'Space', 'Most', 'episodes', 'are', 'worth', 'seeing', 'more', 'hoping', 'upcoming', 'Serenity', 'movie', 'up', 'show', 'quality', 'success', 'get', 'several', 'more', 'Serenity', 'movies', 'here', 'hoping', 'money', 'people', 'Hollywood', 'give', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'carte', 'blanche', 'do', 'what', 'future', 'rare', 'talent', 'who', 'can', 'transform', 'genre', 'fiction', 'art']",N/A

Instead, you had to go to each episode's sub-menu and go from there.  That's gone with the Blu-ray release as you can watch all the episodes with the nifty ""play all"" feature.The HD version does look better than the original DVD release, though at times there is grain in the picture (as was in the DVD release when played on an HDTV).  This comes through mostly during scenes that aren't well lit.  It also comes into play during some fast-motion action sequences too.  It isn't bad, but it is noticeable especially after a moment where things look ""shiny.""The extras are pretty much what came with the DVD release, though I believe there is one or two new small extras.The bad comes from the fact that the BD disables my player's resume feature completely.  What does this mean?  Simply put, it means that when I press ""stop"" on my fully upgraded Blu-ray player, pressing play again makes me go through the entire 30-seconds of loading, anti-piracy messages, and then finally the menu.  While this is true on quite a number of BD titles, this is the first one that does not have the compensation ""bookmark"" feature so that at least after you go through the annoyance of having to go through the load stuff again, you can then start back up at your bookmark.  As such, if you need to stop in mid-play, you better just press ""pause"" or be annoyed (unless you don't mind wasting time to get back to where you left off, to say nothing of trying to remember where you left off).So in upgrading your DVD set, you'll get an overall better picture, better sound, and you trade one annoyance with another.

VIZ:Someone talked about the planets being terraformed 'by magic.'  Not magic--technology; so what if the ins and outs of the technology weren't explained?Some others said that the mixture of English and Chinese was 'ridiculous.'  How so when the the two most powerful countries on Earth are the United States and China?  Hence, when Humanity left Earth-that-Was, is it not logical that English and Mandarin would be the two dominant languages?The idea of having some colonies being almost pre-industrial while others were as 'futuristic' as any in science fiction was a refreshing departure from the sf convention of everything being squeaky-clean.  The juxtaposition of the two is a perfect metaphor for modern society, where in the most wealthy country on earth we have people who don't even have indoor plumbing.I will agree that the characters weren't as well-developed as they might have been, nor were certain questions fully answered (like what, exactly, was the Blue Sun Corporation up to, and what was it that was so bad about the Alliance government?) but it is hardly the writer's or director's fault that the show was cancelled before they got around to that.  I'm sure that there are unused scripts gathering dust in desk drawers which would fill out these issues, and that the upcoming movie will do so.The most interesting and enigmatic character is the Shepherd Book. I agree with the writer who said that he was given little to do.  I suspect that in a former life he had been a high official in the Alliance, and that during the War he had done something horrible, something for which he could not forgive himself; after spending some time in the Abbey, it was laid on him as a penance that he find a group of die-hard Independantists who had suffered from the war and to minister to themJW wanted to be the 'anti Trek.'  Where on Trek the universe was so full of sentient life that you almost couldn't turn over a rock without finding it, in this show humankindis alone.

Moore,"[10, 11]","I might actually watch TV once in a while if there were more shows like this.I saw the pilot episode of this on the Sci Fi channel and immediately went out and purchased the DVD.  Now I understand why a DVD TV series that was released in 2002 is sitting up at #3 on the Top Sellers list in the waning days of 2005.  This is just really great acting, writing, directing, music, and everything.It's an accidental conglomeration of wildly different characters,  brought together by fate and bound by love, hate, honor, and betrayal.  The interactions and frictions between the characters helps to drive each episode in new and unexpected directions.  Through the 13 meaty 40+ minute episodes and hour-long pilot (well worth the price of this set), you will meet each of the 9 central characters and grow quickly to know them.  Many you will love, some you will hate, some you will hate to love, and others you will love to - well, you get the idea.Many memorable lines and moments will grab you as you take in the entire series.  I personally had a hard time putting it down once I started.  I recommend beginning your viewing early on a Saturday, in case you get hooked like I did.  Going to work the next day with only four episodes under my belt, knowing there were so many more yet to see was near torture.  As soon as I finished watching, I started them all over again.I am not quite sure what Fox was thinking, or any network for that matter.  I guess there isn't much room on TV for witty writing, heartwarming characters, exciting action, and clever plots.  Since there isn't, I guess we can say thank god for DVDs, and thank god for the internet so we can find out about gems like this that might have otherwise have been missed.I know it's weird, but I actually think my life has been enriched for having seen that someone out there is making material with this much heart.  The entire series was some of the best guilt-free entertainment I have had in years, and my only problem with it is that there aren't 100 more episodes.Rent it first if you're not sure this is right for you, but whatever you do, give this series a chance.  This is not something I would have normally picked up on my own, and I am so glad I stumbled across it.  Thrilling adventures, clever story lines, witty dialogue, and the best gorram TV show nobody ever saw (although with DVD sales the way they are, perhaps that's not exactly true anymore!).If you happen to like this and you're hungry for more, check out Serenity.  It's a Big Damn Movie that takes these same characters on a silver screen adventure (hopefully not the last!) which takes place after the events in the series, which only got made apparently because this DVD sold so well.

It was... phenomenal. And like too many shows on Fox, cancelled far too soon.The show follows the crew of the Serenity, a group of ""transporters"" with no scruples about taking a less-than-level cargo if the pay is right and with a bone to pick with the Alliance, the official government. There's a brother and sister on board, both fugitives (she from a top-secret government academy that performed mysterious experiments on her, he for rescuing her), a ""Shepherd"" (preacher) with some mysterious ties of his own, an official ""Companion"" (do the euphemism yourself), a spunky mechanic, a tough-as-nails second-in-command married to the wisecracking pilot, a dirty-fingernailed grunt and, of course, a captain with a past to live down. Each character has strengths and weaknesses, real personalities and real histories. They're what make the show work.Here, I think, is what hurt it - it couldn't be classified. A lot of people who saw it didn't know what they were really watching - not a far-flung space opera, but a western in the sky. These characters aren't noble Starfleet Officers, they're gunslingers with a definite sense of right and wrong and no qualms about striking out against the ""wrong"" as they see it. They carry firearms, wear dirty, dusty clothes and even ride horses when they're planetside. There's more than one episode where you could watch the first five minutes and think it's a show set in the Nevada territories in the 1880s until they finish up whatever job they're on and go back to their spaceship. In short, it was a great show, but one that people couldn't pigeonhole, and while the die-hard fans love that sort of thing, the public at large, sadly, doesn't.The DVD set includes a few nice extras, including a half-hour-long ""Making of"" documentary, a few other featurettes, a gag reel and an audition tape.

I tried this show because of Joss Whedon, as I was such a big fan of Buffy, and Nathan Fillion, whom I enjoyed as Caleb in Buffy season 7. I don't know how Joss does it, but his shows have a way of sticking with you, his characters linger in my head long after they have disappeared from the screen. Firefly is a perfect example, a show built around nine space travelers each of whom are dynamic, fleshed out characters including the captain, a registered companion (legal form of prostitute) who rents a shuttle, a brother and sister who are fleeing the Alliance, a chaplain, and a man who is a veritable mercenary and tempted by the financial possibilities of betraying the crew. Additionally, Joss has a way of creating an amazing backdrop for his stories. In Firefly, there was the war for unification between the Alliance and the Independents (a.k.a. Browncoats) which leaves a world with central Alliance-loyal planets and outer reaches where the law does not extend, home to all manner of people, including the flesh-eating Reavers who might not be called people at all.

Marold""","[0, 0]","Let's be quick, because this review will sink into the crowd in a few days.In spite of a small budget and rudimentary effects and broken laws of physics, this may be one of the very best interpretations of the ""Space Opera"" genre. It had at least four mysteries in its back story. And in these scant 14 episodes none of them were resolved, however in the film, ""Serenity"", two are resolved. There is also the arc of the romance between two characters. And with nine characters on the ""Serenity"", four of which have mysterious backgrounds, that's more than enough to keep things interesting. But that's water over the dam.If there is anything which defines the difference between ""Firefly"" and ""Star Wars"", its the way Nathan Fillion interprets the character of the captain of the ""Serenity"". Fillion is much, much more realistic than Han Solo as both an outlaw and a captain of a ship with some noisome crew members and ""passengers"". Most fun comes form Adam Baldwin, who is playing his signature ""Animal Mother"" character from ""Full Metal Jacket"".One very important law of physics which is obeyed is the time required to travel great distances. Unlike the universe in Star Wars, the venue for Firefly is just one planetary system. One or maybe two suns around which several planets and their moons circle which are capable of being terraformed, and have been made earthlike several generations before. Therefore, there are no interstellar jumps, and it is harder for the transporter / smuggler / bandit crew of the Serenity to hide from the authorities of the government of the inner planets. That mean it is not at all implausible that the outer planets have a wild west feel to them, not unlike Tatooine. It is probably easier to transport a colt to a world with no gas, but lots of prairie, and use horse power.One wonderful backstory unexplored is why so many actors break out in Chinese speeches. It's a lot like better Sci-Fi back stories like ""Clockwork Orange"" with its Russian slang and ""Blade Runner"" with its ""city speak"" (sic). Only in the audio comments do we hear that its based on the idea that before emigrating to this new system, earth was controlled by two cultures, American and Chinese. So all business is conducted in English or Chinese, or a bit of both.One thing which adds a strong sense of reality to the filming is that the entire interior of ""Serenity"" was built as one complete set, with loads of realistic looking ""used future"" fixtures. They can film long steadycam scenes from one end of the ship to another without a break.Here's hoping someone gets the wherewithal to do for ""Firefly"" what they did for ""Star Trek"".",5,Subtlties abound.

765914,A2AA00U9FO4UAC,B0000AQS0F,Bradley J. Keusch,"[4, 4]","absolutely, undeniably, one of the greatest shows that has ever aired on network television, and my personal favorite dramatic television show ever. It's perhaps a bit daunting to both camps, those who like sci-fi, and those who don't, because although it looks sci-fi (flying space ships, and what not), that's really not what it is, at it's heart. All of Josh Whedon's shows have been about creating and finding family, and focused strongly on character development, and this series has both in spades. Whedon writes dialog with such effortless flair, and he is a master of never letting the viewer get bored...or comfortable. The good always has a little bad mixed up in it, and the really bad moments always seem to be hilighted with a bit of black humor (one of the absolute funniest moments in the series occurs early in I believe the pilot when Mal tells Simon that Kaylee is dead, and she's not...watch and see). This is much how life IS though, it's never simple, and if you are bothered by such things then go back to watching your ABC sitcoms. The ""western"" elements that are often advertised come in in the form of the rim planets, where conditions are poor, and many people live in poverty. Hardly a episode passes where you don't see someone riding a horse. But it all fits, and feels very natural. Regardless of how advanced technology and society gets, there will always be those on the outside of it.The characters themselves are magnificently crafted, none more so than Mal, the reluctant protagonist. He fought against the Alliance (think Star Wars' Empire, but with far less sinister overtones) and lost, and is now something of an outlaw, and takes pirating jobs with his crew to scrape out an existence. What Serenity (the name of his ship) is to him, is a sense of freedom, and a family. The absolute greatest moments in the series come when this is felt strongly. When the crew is sitting around the table eating dinner together, when they are on a backwater planet singing and dancing and drinking with the locals (and Mal ends up getting married...); the show is without peer in its ability to create a sense of camaraderie, and truly, of family. In instilling the belief in you that no matter how big the galaxy may be, as long as you have someone next to you,  its always managable.The show is intriguing, poignant, hilarious (if you don't laugh during Jaynestown, you might in fact be a robot), and absolutely a MUST see.

First Dark Angel got the axe after a second successful season, and now Firefly, the heir apparent to Buffy, never got a chance to stretch its wings.Oh well, at least Whedon's making a movie, and until then, the DVD will more than tide over rabid fans. This thing is packed, even going so far as to include the 3 episodes that never made it to the air. And this series just feels at home on DVD, as it was aired in widescreen format. It also features the best visual effects that have ever graced a television show, and an ensemble cast that, in a few episodes, accomplish what some casts never do in 100 (Friends anyone?).The intriguing story of a ragtag group of outlaws in space makes for a compelling backdrop, and all the episodes play off of the characters, not just their struggles against the Space Mafia and the tyrannical Alliance, though these conflicts are certainly well done. Each character grows somehow over the course of the all-to-short series, and in addition to the story, there are some great action pieces as well.The extras on the set are great. There are a number of episode commentaries, a behind-the-scenes look with interviews with the cast, as well as interviews with crreator Joss Whedon. Topping off the bonuses are original script drafts and some picture galleries. All solid stuff for collectors and casual fans alike.All in all, if you missed the show, pick this up, as it's a fun ride and will introduce you to the characters before they fly to the big screen next year.

Bloody few.I'd never heard of this show then one day I got a package from Amazon that a girlfriend had sent with the FIREFLY series inside. She loved it and was just sure I would, too.You know what? She was right. I had to fight to limit myself to one show a night, it was that good from show #1. I found myself amazed beyond understanding over a number of points: Like, why hadn't I heard of this show before? How can a TV SHOW be so damned good? Why on earth did Fox cancel it? Will they really do the movie or is this just wistful thinking on the part of the fans? I have no answers for you here.It begins with a song and a guitar, almost western sound, and very, very good. The voice, the song, both are perfect for the show. You see the ship and the sets and you have to be amazed at the quality. There is no down side here, unless you count the untimely demise of a great show. The American history reminders  are unmistakable. It's at the end of a terrible civil war, the Captain and his first mate, Zoe, were on the losing side. Now the whole 'verse is trying to rebuild and do the best they can. There is an old west feel with a new frontier. The bad guys are scary and the good guys have heart. There are no aliens.The actors are exceptional. I fell in love with the Zoe/Wash relationship.

If Star Trek's &quot;Enterprise&quot; (pick any version) can be compared to a CD stereo, then &quot;Serenity&quot; could be compared to an 8-track tape player. But that lovable bucket-of-bolts ship is their lifeline of daily survival in space and on the western-themed planets on which they do business. There's a price on their heads, so they have to operate slightly outside of the law, but they always manage to eke out a livin' somehow while remaining free.There's lots of subtle and outright humor throughout almost every episode (and weirdness like characters speaking Mandarin Chinese at odd times), but that's THE main thing that ties it all together so well. The characters never take themselves too seriously and, when they ain't a squabblin', usually cover each other's backs (but not always). The western flavor comes and goes, so it sometimes plays as more of a straight-forward sci-fi series than a cowboy comedy, but the perils they get into generally tend towards funny and less towards tragic. There are a couple of episodes, however, that are darkly serious.Try not to get too attached to this 14-episode space soap opera because it's over before you know it. It wasn't supposed to be cancelled so soon, so the storylines were never totally resolved, but it was good fun while it lasted.

The images are sharp, the effects hold up very well, and the cast is as quirky as ever. Heck, the pilot episode alone is probably better than 90% of all SF films ever released. And, as my wife says, ""No commercials.""Firefly was intelligent, witty, a bit goofy, character-driven, and a lot of fun. Also had one of the best theme songs of any show of recent memory. So, of course, the network executives moved it around, forced the episodes to be shown out of order, then cancelled it abruptly.Imagine if those same executives had been running Fox when The X-Files started a decade ago.

765930,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B0000AQS0F,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[0, 0]","Joss Whedon broke new ground with his short lived series Firefy. He did not just create a unique space western he created great television. The sad thing is that the powers that were at Fox killed the show before it could ever really develop. True, Firefly, had some issues such as the airing of episodes out of order and in strange timespots but it was certainly a show that with a little development could have survived beyond fourteen sparse episodes. Firefly was so much more than the sum of its parts it was a show that dealt with the bonds between people that come together to create family.The many reviews here adequately describe the plot and the characterizations. If Whedon could do anything it was to develop strong characters whith great dialogue. The characters made this show and will be a part of Whedon's legacy along with Buffy and Angel. The crew of the Serenity joined together a group of diverse characters threw them together in situations that made them help each other, that made them bind, that made them form a family dynamic unlike many that are seen on  regular television. This, in my opinion, is what made the show worthwhile. Sure, the action and special effects were fun to watch but the dynamic between the characters was even better.The series comes complete on four discs. The episodes are presented in the correct viewing order and are presented in widescreen. The widescreen treatment was one of the sore points for Fox that Whedon found to be necessary. The audio is Dolby Surround 2.0 but is quite robust for the presentation. The set offers commentaries on six of the episodes and all but the last are of the anecdotal sort. On his final commentary Whedon waxes philosophic about the episode ""Objects in Space."" There are the usual making of features and gag reel. Watching this material shows a cast that enjoyed working together that worked together quite well.This is one of the finest network series that I have seen in quite a while. Check it out.

Instead, the technology is but one piece of the storyline's backdrop.The concept is simple.  Earth was used up and with only two superpowers left, the USA and China, cultures merged on some level as humanity left for the stars.  Some planets were started with precious little funding after the terraforming was completed, so those planets tended towards being agrarian with a spartan use of technology.  Picture a good western with a high tech spacecraft landing behind the gunfighter, or a high tech communications device sitting in a corner opposite a wood burning stove.Anyways, at some point in time, the wealthier, more industrialized planets decided it was time they were all united under one central government.  The more independent planets protested and fought back.  Despite an impressive fight, the ""Browncoats"" (from the poorer planets) lost.The series is set in a kind of ""Post American Civil War frontier West"" theme.

Surely, I waited way too long to watch it; it is very funny, perhaps the best sitcom on television.  I've been trying to catch up on all six or seven seasons as quickly as possible, and I'm getting close.I was watching an episode last night, where Leonard -- Johnny Galecki -- won a trip to visit the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, and Sheldon -- Jim Parsons -- automatically assumed that Leonard would take Sheldon as a guest.  Instead, Leonard decided to take Penny -- Kaley Cuoco -- and can you blame him?  Especially since it was on Valentine's Day.  I'm sure that Leonard had a lot of colliding on his mind. . . ..Anyways, Sheldon gets mad at Leonard, calling him a &#34;traitor&#34; or something, and a traitor so severe that he was nearly as bad as Rupert Murdoch.  When Leonard looked puzzled by the reference -- everyone is always puzzled by Sheldon's references -- Sheldon said that Mr. Murdoch was a traitor because &#34;he owns Fox and he cancelled Firefly.&#34;  I had heard of Firefly but had never seen it.  Until today, but only by recommendations by Sheldon.After watching the pilot, I'm puzzled by Sheldon's remarks as well.  &#34;Why did he like this series?&#34; is my immediate thinking.  Oh it has the standard &#34;diverse cast&#34; that everyone loves, and it's got some not-quite-lame special effects.  But the dialog is iffy, at best.  At the beginning, some commander dude says something like, &#34;We've just done the impossible.  And that makes us special.&#34;  Now, even Sheldon would have trouble with this logic, because if you've done something, it can't be impossible, unless of course you're in an alternate universe where the rules of Physics are different.  &#34;Well, they didn't do anything impossible then, and therefore they may not be special,&#34; would be my response.At another point, something bad happens and someone else says, &#34;Good God in Heaven.&#34;  I agree with that.  &#34;Good God in Heaven, why did they ever create this series?&#34; would be my question, not &#34;Good God why did Mr. Murdoch ever cancel the series?&#34;My apologies to Sheldon.

It is an sf western with a few brave rogue heroes in a spaceship fighting an evil empire (""the alliance"").  The music and sets are extremely multicultural, and any cussing or expletives are in Chinese, which adds a wonderful flavor to the dialog.  How does such an impossible combination fantasy world work?  I'm not sure exactly, but it does work.  Kudos to Joss Whedon.  Having amazing sets and special effects certainly helps, and the dialog and acting are well done.However, the (English) dialog lacked quite the same humour and depth of literary reference we know and love from Buffy.  I would have appreciated the DVD's more if the DVD subtitles were to translate the Chinese slang rather than just saying ""(speaks in Chinese)"".  And unlike Buffy, where dialog was at a college grade level, Firefly uses a simpler subset of English language, at more of an advanced high school level.Nathan Fillion, who plays Mal, the captain of Firefly did not work for me as a convincing leadership figure.  His natural character is quite different from the part he plays, and to me he never completely seems to get in character.  There always seems to be a detached and ironic mein that does not seem compatible with the leadership role he tries to play.Lastly, there is not much season arc.  Each episode story stands (quite well) alone.  This was fine with me, but if you need a season arc, or you need more than the 14 episodes in this set, you will be disappointed.In summary, despite a few failings, this was a great series which died prematurely.

Was Gene Roddenbery's dream finally realized? No, Gene had nothing to do with this one, and Fox didn't seem like they wanted to give it much of a chance. Being fans of unusual SciFi like ""Farscape"" and ""LEXX"" we were willing to give it a chance.

I'm glad they were smart enough to make the ""Serenity"" movie as a pie in the face to Fox for cancelling this series. Great movie and great series. I recommend it to all, not just fans of SciFi. This appeals to a much wider group of people and beats the tar out of all the reality dregs the networks came up with at the same time. If there were more series like this and fewer reality shows, I think more people would be watching TV again. This reminded me a little of a future Western, and most of us wouldn't mind seeing a Western again after so many years of absence. If you think about it, if people were in fact colonizing new planets, they would in fact start out very low tech since they wouldn't have alot of money and it would be expensive and hard to get high tech equipment.

We have a crew of 7 (OK nine after the two mysterious siblings have been picked up) renegades fleeing from the clutches of the boo-hiss Alliance (who wear uniforms not dissimilar to the Federation in the B7 universe). We have splendidly complex and rounded characters, who are not 100% good or bad. Captain Reynolds owes more than a little to Paul Darrow's Avon I reckon. Whereas alien planets would generally be represented by a quarry or similar in B7, some Wild Western scrubland does the same job in Firefly. The scenario in the Firefly episode Bushwacked is *extremely* similar to the B7 episode in which the gang first find the Liberator. Finally, I noted some dialogue in Firefly (""I was aiming for his head"") lifted directly from the B7 scripts. Sincerest form of flattery? Yeah maybe. But so what? I thoroughly enjoyed Blakes 7 (wobbly sets and all) and I am thoroughly enjoying Firefly too.This is undoubtedly thought-provoking, intelligent sci-fi with very strong characterisation. Whedon's notion to set it as a Western may require some viewers to suspend their disbelief quite a bit, but if you just go with the flow you will not be disappointed. There's a great sense of fun in here too. Trust me, this is light years ahead of Voyager or Enterprise.Decent enough extras - commentaries and stuff. Sadly no 5.1 sound though.Two disks still to go!

But I suspect theses were probably the only 1400 sci-fi nerds who ever saw `Firefly'.Being a sci-fi nerd myself I was intrigued by `Firefly's reviewers. All very die hard Joss Whedon fans. Whedon is of course famous for `Buffy; The Vampire Slayer' and is also well known for his interviews in which he comes across not as a studio suit but as a sci-fi fan you might meet at a convention. I too was enthralled by Whedon in that I could identify heavily with him.Sad to say `Firefly' does Whedon no credit.The plot: As you've already discerned from Amazon, `Firefly' is a futuristic space odyssey based on the wild west. Sure they fly space ships but they also chew bakky carry peacemakers and ride horses. Whedon's crew of the Serenity is not out to save the universe but merely survive in it by going from score to score and evading the Big Brother-commi/nazi-Empire ""The Alliance"" and the ""Reaver"" cannibal pirates.Why `Firefly' fails:Space odyssey genre rarely works. Whedon was doomed to fail here. So many others have tried but so few have succeeded. I can only name three space odyssey shows that have worked and two were `Star Treks'. Whatever your favorites you must admit that while there are many great sci-fi shows, very few are space odysseys.Characters are flat. While Whedon is best known for his characters, `Firefly's are not the be remembered. First off, there are tooooo many. The pilot and his warrior wife serve absolutely NO PURPOSE as well as they holy man. Whedon should have learned, keep your core to 4 or 5 characters not 9 like the crew of the Serenity. Serenity's prostitute whom was obviously added for sex appeal is neither glamorous nor funny, and adds NOTHING to the story. Give the poor pretty something to do, even if it's just repeating the computer like in `Galaxy Quest'.The acting is substandard. To call the acting ""pathetic"" would be unfair. It's not so god-awful I had to turn off the DVD, but the acting is certainly below the expectations of television as many other  Amazon reviewers have noted.Thin narrative hooks plague the show. While Whedon could get away with this on `Buffy' it doesn't work on `Firefly'. Let's face it, those plots were pretty thin. ""The gym teacher's a zombie."" Here we have, ""Let's rob the train."" The stories are not compelling.By far the worst thing about `Firefly' which kills it, is our hero captain Nathan Fillion. He is neither an honorable hero nor a hard ass tuff guy, instead he comes across like a Hamlet uncertain of the right thing. Whether this is on purpose by Whedon or unintentional, it doesn't work. The whole time I kept struggling to think, ""Where have I seen Nathan Fillion before?"" After reviewing his filmography I realized I haven't seen him before, he's just a TRULY MEMORABLE BAD ACTOR. He comes across like a poor imitation of Colin Farrell.In conclusion, `Firefly' is bad actors playing worse characters acting out a plotless script in the most difficult of television's genres.",3,Overrated Sci-fi,1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,3049,"['Wow', 'average', '5', 'stars', '1400', 'viewers', 'rating', 'Amazon', 'suspect', 'theses', 'were', 'probably', 'only', '1400', 'sci-fi', 'nerds', 'who', 'ever', 'saw', ""Firefly'.Being"", 'sci-fi', 'nerd', 'was', 'intrigued', 'Firefly', 'reviewers', 'very', 'die', 'hard', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'fans', 'Whedon', 'course', 'famous', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'also', 'well', 'known', 'interviews', 'across', 'not', 'studio', 'suit', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'might', 'meet', 'convention', 'too', 'was', 'enthralled', 'Whedon', 'could', 'identify', 'heavily', 'him.Sad', 'say', 'Firefly', 'Whedon', 'credit.The', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'already', 'discerned', 'Amazon', 'Firefly', 'futuristic', 'space', 'odyssey', 'based', 'wild', 'west', 'Sure', 'fly', 'space', 'ships', 'also', 'chew', 'bakky', 'carry', 'peacemakers', 'ride', 'horses', 'Whedon', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'not', 'save', 'universe', 'merely', 'survive', 'going', 'score', 'score', 'evading', 'Big', 'Brother-commi/nazi-Empire', 'Alliance', 'Reaver', 'cannibal', 'pirates.Why', 'Firefly', 'fails', 'Space', 'odyssey', 'genre', 'rarely', 'Whedon', 'was', 'doomed', 'fail', 'here', 'So', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'tried', 'so', 'few', 'have', 'succeeded', 'can', 'only', 'name', 'three', 'space', 'odyssey', 'shows', 'have', 'worked', 'two', 'were', 'Star', 'Treks', 'favorites', 'must', 'admit', 'are', 'many', 'great', 'sci-fi', 'shows', 'very', 'few', 'are', 'space', 'odysseys.Characters', 'are', 'flat', 'Whedon', 'best', 'known', 'characters', 'Firefly', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'remembered', 'First', 'off', 'are', 'tooooo', 'many', 'pilot', 'warrior', 'wife', 'serve', 'absolutely', 'NO', 'PURPOSE', 'as', 'well', 'holy', 'man', 'Whedon', 'should', 'have', 'learned', 'keep', 'core', '4', '5', 'characters', 'not', '9', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'Serenity', 'prostitute', 'whom', 'was', 'obviously', 'added', 'sex', 'appeal', 'glamorous', 'funny', 'NOTHING', 'story', 'Give', 'poor', 'pretty', 'something', 'do', 'even', 'just', 'repeating', 'computer', 'Galaxy', ""Quest'.The"", 'acting', 'substandard', 'call', 'acting', 'pathetic', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'not', 'so', 'god-awful', 'had', 'turn', 'off', 'DVD', 'acting', 'certainly', 'expectations', 'television', 'many', 'other', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted.Thin', 'narrative', 'hooks', 'plague', 'show', 'Whedon', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'Buffy', ""n't"", 'work', 'Firefly', 'Let', 'face', 'plots', 'were', 'pretty', 'thin', 'gym', 'teacher', 'zombie', 'Here', 'have', 'Let', 'rob', 'train', 'stories', 'are', 'not', 'compelling.By', 'far', 'worst', 'thing', 'Firefly', 'hero', 'captain', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'honorable', 'hero', 'hard', 'ass', 'tuff', 'guy', 'instead', 'Hamlet', 'uncertain', 'right', 'thing', 'purpose', 'Whedon', 'unintentional', ""n't"", 'work', 'whole', 'time', 'kept', 'struggling', 'think', 'Where', 'have', 'seen', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'reviewing', 'filmography', 'realized', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'just', 'TRULY', 'MEMORABLE', 'BAD', 'ACTOR', 'poor', 'imitation', 'Colin', 'Farrell.In', 'conclusion', 'Firefly', 'bad', 'actors', 'playing', 'worse', 'characters', 'acting', 'out', 'plotless', 'script', 'most', 'difficult', 'television', 'genres']",N/A

765957,A2H3TGP5WIJNHK,B0000AQS0F,"Center Man ""centerman@aol.com""","[13, 13]","1) An intriguing sense of futility.  Yeah, &quot;Firefly&quot; takes the concept of science fiction as a western (&quot;Star Trek&quot; was sold to NBC as &quot;Wagon Train to the stars&quot;) and treats it literally. But what struck me more was the sense of loss, from Simon and River's home to Captain Reynolds' ideals.  American science fiction tends to accentuate the positive, and this darkness made the characters that much more interesting.  In addition, the show made it clear the Alliance, an evil empire that Reynolds fought in a civil war, was there to stay. No one -- not Reynolds, not anyone -- was going to overthrow it.  In that sense, &quot;Firefly&quot; reminded me of &quot;Blake's 7,&quot; a late 70/early 80s British science fiction show where the heroes fought a huge government and won a few victories but never came close to upsetting the underlying order.  Captain Reynolds' motto isn't &quot;Use the Force&quot; or &quot;Boldly Go Where No Man Has Gone Before,&quot; but &quot;Keep Flying,&quot; which is as close to resignation and defeat as you'll get.  But it feels a lot more realistic than other sci-fi aphorisms.2) Great ensemble acting.  The cast was largely full of unkowns (save for &quot;Barney Miller's&quot; Ron Glass) who jelled quickly and shaded their characters effectively.  In particular, the mercenary Jayne (Adam Baldwin) gets the funniest lines but is probably the darkest person on the ship, one who would -- and nearly does -- sell out the crew if the money is good enough.  It's likely other characters would have blossomed, too, given enough time.3) The story.  &quot;Buffy&quot; fans know Whedon's ability to tell a great yarn (I actually saw all of &quot;Firefly&quot; before a single &quot;Buffy&quot; episode), and there were some brilliant ongoing tales in the show.  The plot on River, a super-intelligent teenager who had been cruelly experimented on, is probably the best, and gradually unrolls over the 13-episode run, showing not only the impact of what had been done to her but the love between her and her brother Simon.  There are some great stand alone stories, too, especially &quot;Jaynestown,&quot; a moving meditation on faith and heroism.  The show wrapped up without leaving too many hanging threads, but the ones that remained (including the relationship between Reynolds and the prostitute Inara) were enough to make you wish the show had continued.4) The likelihood of a &quot;Firefly&quot; movie will increase exponentially if you buy this DVD (the studio is keeping an eye on sales of this set).

Utterly ridiculous. This scene should have been two ships docking in orbit, or sneaking into some futuristic ""neutral territory"" to work the deal. The injection of actual old-west settings makes no sense (horses, sweat-stained bandanas, bandoliers draped across the chest, revolver-looking guns, sacks of coins being tossed back and forth). If the writers wanted the ""frontier spirit,"" they could have shown this in futuristic settings. In fact, they already did for the first hour of the pilot, and it was going fine.I couldn't even watch the second episode more than 10 minutes.

Every episode was like a mini-movie and the characters were beyond description. The stories are as well written as novels and the special effects were better than anything you see on TV today- but without a doubt, it's the characters.Whereas most TV shows put cliche' characters in 'pounded-to-death' situations, these guys played these roles as if they were the first EVER to pull it off. The 'rouge pilot on the run' the 'cute girl mechanic' the 'out for himself soldier'- all these cliche's are done just PERFECTLY!!

So I am giving it two stars to be fair. I will also make an sincere attempt to rent the video set and watch the whole thing. I have to admit that in my one-episode view, I was very put off by the whole Wild West thing -- in my humble opinion, when a futuristic sci fi series utilizes 19th century costumes, it isn't some act of great cleverness...it's because it is far cheaperto dip into the movie studio's big archives of western clothing from various cowboy series of the past than it is to come up with neat, interesting futuristic costumes (and requires far less imagination).I have to mention, also, because I just read all 158 reviews here on Amazon, and not a single one of mostly enthusiastic supporters managed to say: This is basically a re-do of Joss Whedon's &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; plot minus, of course, the copyrighted Aliens. Honest.I always thought that &quot;Alien Resurrection's&quot; crew of the freighter &quot;The Betty&quot; had some kind of backstory that never made it to the screen. Unfortunately due to the demands of the Alien franchise, half of the Betty crew gets eaten...and early on. I think Whedon always wanted to develop this idea, and &quot;Firefly&quot; was his big chance.Don't believe me? Re-rent &quot;Resurrection&quot;. The Betty is also a small, dirty unregistered freighter running slightly illegal operations, occasionally smuggling or doing mercenary work in a ragtag universe. Just like FIrefly, aside from the famous &quot;Aliens&quot; (who are unknown to most of humanity) there are no other extra terrestrials (ala Star Trek) in this universe. Despite being set 500 years in the future (just like Firefly), the sci-fi setting looks contemporary and industrial...no fancy high tech anything. And it's very dirty. The Betty originally had a crew of 8 (cut down in the final shooting script to just six) and the Serenity has a crew of 9.The Betty captain is crude mouthed, morally ambivalent but is basically a decent guy, who thinks of the crew as a kind of family -- he calls the ship the &quot;family wagon&quot; and its constantly out of food or supplies. While he isn't exactly married, he is clearly in a long-term romantic relationship with the ship's pilot. The ship's mechanic is a fiesty, cute young girl, just out of her teens. There a &quot;muscle man&quot;, who is big and burly but a nice guy underneath it all. The ship's female pilot and second-in-command is a tough cookie who is just as smart and strong as the guys.I can only guess that this is an idea Whedon just can't get out of his system...he was reportedly VERY unhappy with the final shooting script and production of &quot;Resurrection&quot;, as were most hardcore Alien fans. Maybe it would have worked a whole lot better to have started &quot;Firefly&quot;  off as a movie, maybe on the Sci Fi network if not big screen, and THEN spun off a series... .when there was a measurable fan base. Cuz THIS method sure didn't work.Clearly everything to do with the advertising/promotion and the scheduling of Firefly was blown, big time. I am generally a sci fi fan, and would have given it a chance, but the reviews were very damning and the whole western thing really put me off. It will be interesting to see what kind of movie Joss Whedon comes up with out of the flotsam and jetsam that is left...for example, will he shoot the movie with the same cast as the TV series?Not really a good or bad review here....I just think that fans and even non-fans ought to know what the back story is.",2,People -- have you never watched &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;?,1070668800,"12 6, 2003",2003,3616,"['fairness', 'only', 'caught', 'one', 'episode', 'FIREFLY', 'quot', 'Shindig', 'quot', 'Fox', 'yanked', 'So', 'am', 'giving', 'two', 'stars', 'be', 'fair', 'will', 'also', 'make', 'sincere', 'attempt', 'rent', 'video', 'set', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'have', 'admit', 'one-episode', 'view', 'was', 'very', 'put', 'off', 'whole', 'Wild', 'West', 'thing', 'humble', 'opinion', 'when', 'futuristic', 'sci', 'fi', 'series', '19th', 'century', 'costumes', ""n't"", 'act', 'great', 'cleverness', 'far', 'cheaperto', 'dip', 'movie', 'studio', 'big', 'archives', 'western', 'clothing', 'various', 'cowboy', 'series', 'past', 'come', 'up', 'neat', 'interesting', 'futuristic', 'costumes', 'far', 'less', 'imagination', 'have', 'mention', 'also', 'just', 'read', '158', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'not', 'single', 'one', 'mostly', 'enthusiastic', 'supporters', 'managed', 'say', 'basically', 're-do', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'quot', 'Alien', 'Resurrection', 'quot', 'plot', 'minus', 'course', 'copyrighted', 'Aliens', 'Honest.I', 'always', 'thought', 'quot', 'Alien', 'Resurrection', 'quot', 'crew', 'freighter', 'quot', 'Betty', 'quot', 'had', 'kind', 'backstory', 'never', 'made', 'screen', 'Unfortunately', 'due', 'demands', 'Alien', 'franchise', 'half', 'Betty', 'crew', 'eaten', 'early', 'think', 'Whedon', 'always', 'wanted', 'develop', 'idea', 'quot', 'Firefly', 'quot', 'was', 'big', 'chance.Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Re-rent', 'quot', 'Resurrection', 'quot', 'Betty', 'also', 'small', 'dirty', 'unregistered', 'freighter', 'running', 'slightly', 'illegal', 'operations', 'occasionally', 'smuggling', 'doing', 'mercenary', 'work', 'ragtag', 'universe', 'Just', 'FIrefly', 'aside', 'famous', 'quot', 'Aliens', 'quot', 'who', 'are', 'unknown', 'most', 'humanity', 'are', 'other', 'extra', 'terrestrials', 'ala', 'Star', 'Trek', 'universe', 'being', 'set', '500', 'years', 'future', 'just', 'Firefly', 'sci-fi', 'setting', 'contemporary', 'industrial', 'fancy', 'high', 'tech', 'anything', 'very', 'dirty', 'Betty', 'originally', 'had', 'crew', '8', 'cut', 'down', 'final', 'shooting', 'script', 'just', 'six', 'Serenity', 'crew', '9.The', 'Betty', 'captain', 'crude', 'mouthed', 'morally', 'ambivalent', 'basically', 'decent', 'guy', 'who', 'crew', 'kind', 'family', 'ship', 'quot', 'family', 'wagon', 'quot', 'constantly', 'food', 'supplies', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'married', 'clearly', 'long-term', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'ship', 'pilot', 'ship', 'mechanic', 'fiesty', 'cute', 'young', 'girl', 'just', 'teens', 'quot', 'muscle', 'man', 'quot', 'who', 'big', 'burly', 'nice', 'guy', 'ship', 'female', 'pilot', 'second-in-command', 'tough', 'cookie', 'who', 'just', 'smart', 'strong', 'guys.I', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'idea', 'Whedon', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'system', 'was', 'reportedly', 'VERY', 'unhappy', 'final', 'shooting', 'script', 'production', 'quot', 'Resurrection', 'quot', 'were', 'most', 'hardcore', 'Alien', 'fans', 'Maybe', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'have', 'started', 'quot', 'Firefly', 'quot', 'off', 'movie', 'maybe', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'network', 'not', 'big', 'screen', 'THEN', 'spun', 'off', 'series', 'was', 'measurable', 'fan', 'base', 'Cuz', 'THIS', 'method', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'work.Clearly', 'everything', 'do', 'advertising/promotion', 'scheduling', 'Firefly', 'was', 'blown', 'big', 'time', 'am', 'generally', 'sci', 'fi', 'fan', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'chance', 'reviews', 'were', 'very', 'damning', 'whole', 'western', 'thing', 'really', 'put', 'off', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'up', 'flotsam', 'jetsam', 'left', 'example', 'will', 'shoot', 'movie', 'same', 'cast', 'TV', 'series', 'Not', 'really', 'good', 'bad', 'review', 'here', '.I', 'just', 'think', 'fans', 'even', 'non-fans', 'ought', 'know', 'what', 'back', 'story']",N/A

765971,A17ZP3VKZ4QRWT,B0000AQS0F,Charlie Brooks,"[1, 1]","Firefly is a unique science fiction series that got canceled thanks to some historical incompetence by the executives at Fox. With interesting characters, a compelling setting, and generally good storytelling, the series showed all the potential in the world before getting pulled off the air.The series follows the adventures of Mal Reynolds and his misfit crew aboard the smuggling ship Serenity, a Firefly-class spaceship that travels an area known as the Black. The setting focuses around the premise that in the far future an American-Chinese alliance has begun settling a distant section of the universe. The Alliance itself is tyrannical, causing the audience to sympathize with Mal and his lowly band of theives as they try to cling onto whatever freedom they can find.Firefly is blessed with a terrific cast of actors. Nathan Fillion carries the show as Mal, and is helped by steller performances from Adam Baldwin as the thuggish gunman Jane, Alan Tudyk as the wise-cracking pilot Wash, and many others. The actors fall in their characters terrifically, pushing the show along even in the rare moment of mediocrity.While the series' creator Joss Whedon is talented, he is not infalliable, and there are a few flaws in the show. Some of the episodes get heavy-handed in either image or message, and the old-fashioned dialogue sometimes doesn't convey quite what it should. Whedon's biggest problem seems to be writing female characters, who always seem to fall into one of four categories: the overly cheerful helper, the abrasive wise woman, the butch combat fiend, or the crazy woman with super powers. Those categories aptly describe not only the women aboard Serenity but all the women in this or any other series done by Whedon. Thankfully, the actors again manage to carry the show along and mask its weak spots well.Despite a few minor flaws, Firefly is a terrific television series that should not have been pulled from the air when it was.

Absolutely nothing...but I feel compelled to chime in anyway :)Unlike many, it took me a little longer to fall in love with Firefly and to truly 'get' what all the fuss was about. I'm mentioning that in case someone else reading this was relatively underwhelmed initially but willing to give the show a second chance. The series might just not be your cup of TV tea, of course...but you might, as I did, find that a second or even third viewing hooks you for the remainder of your TV-viewing life :)The show is a space western, and generally combines traditional elements of both genres in creative, engaging ways. As always while viewing Whedon shows, there are a couple of characters who didn't quite resonate with me---but it ceased to matter, as other characters rose quickly to the very top of my personal ""all-time favorites"" list. The dialogue took a little bit of getting used to for me---after all, it's not every day that one hears a blend of Queen's English, Old West slang and the occasional Chinese phrase ;) (Rest assured that the inclusion of Chinese phrases makes perfect sense in the context of the show's background mythology, so it's not nearly as random as it sounds!) Once my ears and I got used to it, though, I became totally enamored with the dialogue and many of the clever, witty, hopeful and thought-provoking quotes that are now happily lodged in my memory.Firefly is brimming over with humor, drama, action, mystery, and even a little romance. It's a true pleasure to look at and listen to. The thing that makes it unique for me is that it can be enjoyed as both a comedic, high energy thrill ride AND a more sneakily deep, intriguingly philosophical sci-fi drama. The cast seems to genuinely love the show, the fans and one another like none other I've come across.As I'm typing this review, this set is on sale for a comparatively inexpensive $9.99. (I spent three times that amount...but still somehow feel it was worth it!) If you're on the fence, this may be the perfect time to hit that tempting orange 'buy' button. I can honestly say that these DVDs have---and will always---get more use than nearly any other in my collection!

I'd never seen the show before picking up this set, although my brother owns the DVDs. Comparing the two, the Blu-ray set is greatly improved over the standard definition set.Detail is generally real high with a lot of appropriate and natural film grain. The series was shot on 35mm film, so I'd expect it to have a filmic appearance. In this regard, it does not disappoint.CGI effects shots don't look as good, as I suspect due to the age of the show that they were done in a much lower resolution and then upscaled for HD. They don't look great, but they don't hamper the enjoyment either. The only way to make them look any better would be to redo them, and I doubt Fox cares enough to put money toward such an endeavor.If you have the DVD set but like hi-def detail and film-like quality, I'd say it's worth the upgrade. It definitely won't disappoint.The show itself? I'm only four episodes in, but I'm enjoying it immensely! I dig westerns and I dig sci-fi. Or rather, I should say I dig ""alternative"" sci-fi.

I remembered watching this show and saying to myself wow this show is great how come its not a bigger hit.  Firefly comes from the mind of Joss Whedon, who is the mastermind behind Marvels &#34;The Avengers&#34;, Dollhouse, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The show features Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, and Adam Baldwin.  The series is set in the year 2517, after the arrival of humans in a new star system, and follows the adventures of the renegade crew of Serenity, a &#34;Firefly-class&#34; spaceship. The ensemble cast portrays the nine characters who live on Serenity.  Whedon pitched the show as &#34;nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things&#34;.The show explores the lives of a group of people who fought on the losing side of a civil war and others who now make a living on the outskirts of society, as part of the pioneer culture that exists on the fringes of their star system. In this future, the only two surviving superpowers, the United States and China, fused to form the central federal government, called the Alliance, resulting in the fusion of the two cultures.  The show has a great cast and writing is also great, which is to be expected from a Joss Whedon movie. The visual effect are first class and the show in my opinion is great from beginning to end.

765985,A3TTKMUH9REXNH,B0000AQS0F,"Christopher Perry ""Azazel2099""","[2, 2]","Firefly is a geat show. 1st the characters/actors are awesome. Each actor has had or currently owns a major role in a television/movie. Nathon Fillion is the main character he is currently on the show Castle. Kalee, Jewel Staite, was also on the show Stargate Atlantis for a awhile. Also, lets not forget Joss Whedon himself, if you liked the new Avenger's movie then you should like this show for they are both his work. My point is the cast is strong, so the comments on bad writing and acting is unfounded. As for the Western aspect of the movie, well in the show they didn't just come out and say it but there is a good reason why it has a western feel to it with a touch of Chinese heritage. Lastly, after this show was cancelled, unjustly, this show had a ""HUGE"" fan base. So much so that Joss Whedon felt he had grounds to finish the series in a full length feature film and he did. The Full length film finishing the Firefly series is called ""Serenity"" and currently holds a 4 1/2 star rating here on Amazon out of 1800 + reviews and was rated a 7.9 on IMDB out of 143,000 people.Let me explain the Western aspect and the Chinese influence to this show for those people who might find merrit in this argument. Joss Whedon doesn't just come out and say it in this show he wants the viewer to watch and come to their own understanding of why modern society in Firely has a Chinese and old western style to it. Most of Frefly's fans understand it but for those who don't let me explain...nerd moment beware....In this show Earth is no more or if there are people still on it, its a LOOOONG ways away. The Alliance is the major power in Firefly, from what I understand the Allaince is comprised of what were the remnants of the Earth's western powers(United States/Great Britain) and China. When they settled on their new worlds they formed an Alliance. This is why you see and hear people in Firefly wearing chinese clothing and speaking Chinese while still using English as their base language. Inara, who plays the companion is a great example of this and is almost always wearing a gown that has a Chinese or oriental style to it. Lastly the western feel to the story, Joss Whedon actually explained this in the show better then the Chinese part alot better, you just have to pay attention. In the Pilot episode they clearly state that after the Alliance TERRAFORMS a world they throw settlers on them with almost no resources and a few small herds and minor supplies. This is why the show has a Western Feel to it, the inner Alliance Core worlds are the Metropolitan mega cities you might be expecting in a Sci-fi show which appear later in the series while the outer rim worlds have the desolate wild west aspect. That is the story plot for the western feel to the story. However, I suspect budget played into this part aswell. Almost every TV show out there costs several million dollars just to air one episode, so the production costs of creating a futuristic city in every episode or space battles and what not probably would be to costly from a producers stand point. The movie Serenity makes up for the lack of production restraints in Firefly and spares no expense when it comes to CGI effects and scenery.",5,Joss Whedon's best work!,1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,3223,"['Firefly', 'geat', 'show', '1st', 'characters/actors', 'are', 'awesome', 'actor', 'had', 'currently', 'major', 'role', 'television/movie', 'Nathon', 'Fillion', 'main', 'character', 'currently', 'show', 'Castle', 'Kalee', 'Jewel', 'Staite', 'was', 'also', 'show', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'awhile', 'Also', 'not', 'forget', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'liked', 'new', 'Avenger', 'movie', 'then', 'should', 'like', 'show', 'are', 'work', 'point', 'cast', 'strong', 'comments', 'bad', 'writing', 'acting', 'unfounded', 'Western', 'aspect', 'movie', 'well', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'come', 'out', 'say', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'western', 'feel', 'touch', 'Chinese', 'heritage', 'Lastly', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'unjustly', 'show', 'had', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'base', 'So', 'much', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'felt', 'had', 'grounds', 'finish', 'series', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'film', 'did', 'Full', 'length', 'film', 'finishing', 'Firefly', 'series', 'called', 'Serenity', 'currently', '4', '1/2', 'star', 'rating', 'here', 'Amazon', '1800', '+', 'reviews', 'was', 'rated', '7.9', 'IMDB', '143,000', 'people.Let', 'explain', 'Western', 'aspect', 'Chinese', 'influence', 'show', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'find', 'merrit', 'argument', 'Joss', 'Whedon', ""n't"", 'just', 'come', 'out', 'say', 'show', 'viewer', 'watch', 'come', 'own', 'understanding', 'why', 'modern', 'society', 'Firely', 'Chinese', 'old', 'western', 'style', 'Most', 'Frefly', 'fans', 'understand', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'explain', 'nerd', 'moment', 'beware', 'show', 'Earth', 'more', 'are', 'people', 'still', 'LOOOONG', 'ways', 'away', 'Alliance', 'major', 'power', 'Firefly', 'what', 'understand', 'Allaince', 'comprised', 'were', 'remnants', 'Earth', 'western', 'powers', 'United', 'States/Great', 'Britain', 'China', 'When', 'settled', 'new', 'worlds', 'formed', 'Alliance', 'why', 'see', 'hear', 'people', 'Firefly', 'wearing', 'chinese', 'clothing', 'speaking', 'Chinese', 'still', 'using', 'English', 'base', 'language', 'Inara', 'who', 'companion', 'great', 'example', 'almost', 'always', 'wearing', 'gown', 'Chinese', 'oriental', 'style', 'Lastly', 'western', 'feel', 'story', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'actually', 'explained', 'show', 'better', 'then', 'Chinese', 'part', 'alot', 'better', 'just', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'clearly', 'state', 'Alliance', 'TERRAFORMS', 'world', 'throw', 'settlers', 'almost', 'resources', 'few', 'small', 'herds', 'minor', 'supplies', 'why', 'show', 'Western', 'Feel', 'inner', 'Alliance', 'Core', 'worlds', 'are', 'Metropolitan', 'mega', 'cities', 'might', 'be', 'expecting', 'Sci-fi', 'show', 'appear', 'later', 'series', 'outer', 'rim', 'worlds', 'have', 'desolate', 'wild', 'west', 'aspect', 'story', 'plot', 'western', 'feel', 'story', 'However', 'suspect', 'budget', 'played', 'part', 'aswell', 'TV', 'show', 'there', 'several', 'million', 'dollars', 'just', 'air', 'one', 'episode', 'production', 'costs', 'creating', 'futuristic', 'city', 'episode', 'space', 'battles', 'what', 'not', 'probably', 'would', 'be', 'costly', 'producers', 'stand', 'point', 'movie', 'Serenity', 'up', 'lack', 'production', 'restraints', 'Firefly', 'expense', 'when', 'CGI', 'effects', 'scenery']",N/A
765986,A1NP91R1CRPNQX,B0000AQS0F,"Christopher R. Travers ""Einhverfr""","[1, 1]","I very much enjoyed this series.  The basic premise is that of a dystopian Western in Space, where a totalitarian government has an iron grip on the most developed planets, and the less developed are left to fend for themselves.  These outer worlds are relatively undeveloped and most of the technology seems like a mix of 19th-20th century, and near future technology.  This is a series where horse-riding cowboys with assault rifles and space ships are found in close proximity.  One eventually gets a sense that the disparity of wealth is what's responsible for this.On the outer fringes, however, you see the dreaded Reavers, insane former humans who mutilate themselves and feast on human flesh, chasing anything that runs from them.So, caught between these forces is the crew from the Firefly, captained by a former resistance officer in a previous war against the totalitarian Alliance, and manned with a colorful bunch.  Several of the characters are enigmas slowly being unravelled.The series of course takes some getting used to.  This is not like other great Sci-Fi series.  It's easy to see a couple of episodes and give up on the whole thing.  Moreover the level of sex and violence in the movie is much higher than it is in other series I typically watch (B5, etc), and the violence is often more brutal.  I would not recommend this for family viewing.Unfortunately this series was cancelled after its first season, so the viewer is left with a sense that the author was just showing the pieces.  One wonders what would have been shown about River, Book, the ""hands of blue"" folks or the like.

I read a few reviews and saw that it was a precursor series to the movie &#34;Serenity.&#34;  I did see that movie and really enjoyed it.  After watching about half of the episodes I am just blown away by how wonderful this series is.  I am quite sad that there is only one season.  While a part of me cannot understand why it was cancelled, another part understands more clearly.  Mainstream television viewers are not interested in a show of this quality.  It has too many elements that poor imaginations cannot wrap around...and poor imaginations are a plenty in the living rooms of America.  People dressed like cowboys flying around in spaceships?  We all know that, in the future, we will all be wearing tight fitting uniforms issued by the interstellar government.  Everything will be clean and shiny.  There will be a problem and our heroes will solve it using nothing but intellect.  We can't possibly be so base, in the future, as to punch people out in a matter of principle.Firefly is a refreshing, imaginative look at the future.  The characters are complex and flawed.  The spaceship is dirty.  It is gritty and realistic, which makes the characters and the worlds encountered much more believable and accessible.  I would trade just about everything on television these days, especially all of the &#34;un&#34;reality shows for more seasons of Firefly.  It makes me sad that, just when something truly entertaining comes along, it is tossed in the garbage heap in favor of another police drama or reality show about idiots running around a swamp somewhere carrying guns.Well, at least I found this absolute gem of a show and had one fantastic season to watch.

Firefly is a science fiction show about a group of rogues that travel aboard a Firefly-class spaceship named Serenity. The universe in Firefly combines past, present and future technologies. There are small towns that looked like they belonged in the western frontier, you'll even see old-fashioned revolver pistols and rifles being used for combat. Then there are the many colonized planets and spaceships and laser weapons used by the elite. The crew of the Serenity ship consists of several strange characters; two war veterens, a pastor, doctor, mercenary, prostitute, ship pilot, mechanic and a young girl with mental problems. They all are unique in their own way, but they become like a family and watch-out for each other's back. The crew runs into; theives, assassins, government agents, gangsters, police, renegades, military soldiers and more. The characters face lots of dangers but they stick together and have a hell of an adventure. I loved every single character in the Serenity crew, and it made me fantasize that I could join them; the characters and dialog in the stories are so intelligent and witty. There were so many times the show just had me laughing out loud and feeling sad during tragic events and just enthralled by the excellent stories from each episode.

766002,A39LRLKACX89IP,B0000AQS0F,Courtland J. Carpenter,"[24, 29]","Never mind their network was built on the backs of shows like the X-Files; FOX, is all about reality television, (Really now, Joe Millionaire is Reality?) hokey action shows, (like 24) plus some T & A shows, (like the also cancelled: Birds of Prey and Fastlane), and not quality television.  Joss Whedon, famous for his clever writing on shows like Buffy, Angel, and several movies was the creative force behind Firefly.  This was to be a different type of Sci-Fi show. He presented us with a realistic view of our possible future, a contrasting viewpoint, from the overly optimistic, Star Trek series.  If it looked like a western, it was because Terraforming other planets, would be a lot like the pioneering days of the old west.Joss presented us with a future time without particle weapons, transporters, and without alien races.  If you think about it, then you'll see the logic in that.  Aliens are still rumor, and even if they do exist, they seem to hide themselves from us (in some sense can you blame them).  Particle weapons would take an unlikely leap in technology, and expense, (and government policy changes) to be handed over to the layman for his personal use.  Transporters, well it's just not set that far in the future!  The FOX executives, (suits) basically seem to believe we are all morons.  They thought the pilot was much too complex to be understood, (for us feeble minded morons) so it became the last episode broadcast, instead of the first.  Hopefully, they will put these in the correct order on the DVDs, and not in their broadcast order.The pilot had the Firefly, (which refers to the cargo ship they fly) landing on a large city- like settlement.  It reminded me of the sets of Blade Runner, the combination of old versus new technology was quite striking, and very well done.  Like Blade Runner you had a mixed blend of races, with a prominent Oriental presence.  Missing, (since it was a settlement on a different planet or moon) was the non-stop darkness, (it wasn't totally polluted as yet) and relentless rain that characterized the Blade Runner movie.  The pilot had a good combination of plot, character development, and action to help you relate to the story.  The episode FOX chose to show instead of the pilot was weak by comparison.  The Sci-Fi Channel does not seem to recognize a good thing when they see it, and passed on picking this up when FOX dropped it. Instead they spend good money developing proven, past turkeys, like Battlestar Galactica.  Give me a break!The cast on this show was very diverse, but seemed to work well together.  They had the right blend of fellowship, conflict, tension, and personal agendas to keep it interesting.  There was a slowly unfolding mystery, in the unknown origin, of some of the passengers.  Some members of the crew were loyal to the highest bidder, and others crew kept their agendas hidden for reasons all their own.  Joss, (the shows creator) generally has a master plan for each one of his seasons. His stories build to a big payoff in the end, and he does not practice cliffhangers.  I'm sorry this one did not get a chance to play out.  He does say he'll try, and resurrect it one day.  I still wish FOX could have completed one full season at least.  Their decision to cancel this, and replace it with a relocated freshman series had a further effect on their programming.  Fastlane, the replacement in the Friday early time slot, probably cost them the higher rated show that followed, John Doe.  I believe this because it makes too much sense that the Sci-Fi audience, would be more likely to stay around, and watch John Doe than fans of Fastlane.  In the end, FOX lost all three shows.Nathan Fillian plays the captain of this group, and seems to be your classic hero type on the surface.  You forget sometimes he's really a smuggler.  He is tough without being a Rambo, and a lot smarter than he lets himself appear.  He has a few trusted crew, and some perhaps not so trustworthy, but otherwise very useful in a fight.  The Firefly crew would probably be doing honest work, if it would pay the bills. Instead a little smuggling, and some outright theft, is the way they make ends meet.  I believe the questionable ethics explored here would have made for lots of interesting episodes, had the show continued.The crew of the Firefly is not totally bad or good, but perhaps better than most.  The captain's cynical nature, (and probably his criminal ambitions) is forged in a past time, which is detailed at the beginning of the pilot. Diversity is nice in the members of the crew; they have a tough girl, a cute techie type, and a worldly type (actually a socially acceptable high-class space prostitute) with some political connections.  Plus one of the passengers is a mysterious girl, with perhaps unknown, mental powers.  The male crew is made up of a pilot, a tough guy, and among the male passengers a preacher, and a doctor, who is brother to the mysterious girl passenger.As I mentioned before, some episodes after the pilot are a little weak.  Probably they will play better after knowing the story from the pilot.  After that, the episodes will get progressively stronger.  The production values on this show are excellent, as are the special FX visuals.  The ship design is interesting, and it makes for some cool special FX graphics, especially in the pilot.  The price of the DVD set is pretty good considering the many hours of entertainment you get for it.  If FOX includes the unaired episodes, you could hardly find a better bargain!  I can't comment on extras or sound yet since it hasn't been released.",5,Where has all the good Sci-Fi gone?

766019,A2OSERGXBYMPJ0,B0000AQS0F,C. T. Mikesell,"[7, 8]","It's a shame that the Fox network cancelled this series at what would have been the halfway point of its first season. Given that, however, it is wonderful that the production end of Fox Entertainment gave the show a second life on DVD. These 14 episodes are incredibly creative, and if they had been given a chance (both in scheduling and longevity) I think the Asian/Western Techno/Antiquarian fusion thing really would have caught on and we'd be eating Southwestern Eggrolls at Chili's (oh, wait...).The cast initially appears to be the standard stereotypical mix of characters (fighters, mechanics, doctor, etc.) and a typical PC mix of white and black characters. After viewing the show a few times you realize that these are *individuals* (the amazon warrior-woman is the geeky pilot's devoted wife; the psycho fighter has a penchant for unfortunate headgear choices; the doctor, far from playing God, has no personality at all; the man of God has a mysterious past (okay, the prostitute with a heart of gold is clich&eacute;, but she also has unexpected depth)); and ethnicity is never an issue - no one is ever referred to by race, nor is the mixed-race marriage ever mentioned - and everyone swears in Chinese.Like the characters, the stories are also complex. Rarely do they go the way you expect them to, and they frequently have two or three plot twists along the way. The dialogue is top notch with very little technospeak to complicate things - if the ship breaks down it's due to a carburetor or a compressor or something else where you have idea what it is. Sure, there are occasional plot holes, but for the most part things make sense from the perspective of the main characters. As disappointing as it is to not know what happens next to the crew of Serenity, there are a couple villains (Niska and Saffron) who reprised their roles during the abbreviated season/series who will also be missed. I said it before and I'll say it again: Shame on Fox for canceling this show (and for other networks not picking it up); hopefully sales of this DVD set and the upcoming feature film will rekindle interest.The DVDs themselves are nicely packaged in slimline cases and include a nice set of extras. The commentaries are good as are the documentaries (hearing Ron Glass belly-laugh was unexpected given the characters he played in this show and on Barney Miller). I was surprised by the swearing in the gag reel, mainly because I would have expected it to be in Chinese. Seeing the episodes in Whedon's intended order is also a plus (the original airdates are also noted so you can scratch your head and wonder ""What was Fox thinking?). The menus tend to lag on my stand-alone DVD player, but run much smoother on my computer.If you're a sci-fi fan you'll like this show. If you're a western fan you'll like this show.  If you want to learn to express yourself colorfully in Chinese you'll love this show.

766031,A3IIBE4D1VECWC,B0000AQS0F,D. Allen,"[0, 0]","I've been hearing off and on over the years that Firefly is one of the best scifi shows ever. I'm always skeptical of the words ""the best"" but I figured I'll one day give it a shot. I saw Firefly on sale on Amazon for 20 bucks and decided I had nothing to lose, except for 20 some odd bucks for s&h.; I hurt myself for not getting this show sooner.Firefly consist of fourteen episodes, three of which were never aired on television. It's about Mal, and his crew of eight who takes on odd jobs. Each crew member is unique, however, and the show focuses on all nine characters at some point and time.Here are the fourteen episodes that you get to see, and my thoughts on them:Serenity Pilot - from my understanding, this was supposed to be the ""pilot"" episode of the series, but instead Tran Job got the pilot due to some management issues. Serenity is not to be confused with the movie, though. This is the only two hours episode you get in the whole Firefly series.The Train Job - the actual pilot that was shown to people back when the show was on television. The episode features some interesting things about Simon and River, two of the interesting characters in the series.Bushwhacked - I believe this is the first time you hear about Reavers which are really space pirates with a twist - they're insane, psychotic people who do some weird stuff to the people they capture.Shindig - a pretty funny episode. I think this episode really shows off the ""western"" feel of the series because it features swordplay and so fort which is interesting to watch.Safe - good episode depending on how you look at it. River and Simon got kidnapped by villagers and near the end, the village declares River as a witch and wants to burn her.Our Mrs Reynolds - features Saffron who is Mal's nemesis in a later episode. Mal gets married, which the crew find funny, but the woman isn't exactly who she say she is. Features a fairly funny moment with Jayne and him trying to trade his favorite weapon for a wife, which he thinks is a fair and honest trade.Jaynestown - there is a character named Jayne who is the crew's muscle. He's tough as nails, but he isn't exactly the brightest. Jayne comes to planet only to find that they think of him like some sort of urban legend. This episode I think highlights the series focus on multiple characters, and how detailed the creator makes each of them.Out Of Gas - Definitely want to watch this sometime after seeing Serenity. This episode features some interesting back stories to how Mal got his crew together.Ariel - another interesting Simon and River episode in that the crew attempts to ""cure"" River and her illness.War Stories - this is one of my favorites. To understand this episode fully, you'd probably want to watch Train Job first. Although the ending of this episode got sort of rushed, I think it went pretty well for the 43 minutes.Trash - You'd want to watch Our Mrs Reynolds first before watching this. I watched this episode before Our Mrs Reynolds and was a bit confused at first. However, you'll find this episode funnier if you watch the said episode first.The Message - this is a strange episode. It's hated by many fans of the show because of its semi-weak story, however, interestingly it also explains a bit of back story between Mal and Zoe when they fought in a war for Independence, the losing side.Heart Of Gold - throughout the series Mal and Inara have a sort of love-hate relationship. This episode sort of features a pretty cool link between the two.Objects In Space - the last of the episodes, but interesting in that it again features Simon and River as the main story.Those are all the episodes. That's it. It doesn't sound like much, but believe me, after watching all 14 episodes, you will probably fall in love with this show and probably want more. The first thought that came to mind was, ""How did they decide to cancel this awesome show?"" It's quite amazing and I'm quite baffled at how someone at a tv network could just drop this show.  After watching this, you'll no doubt want more. Well you don't have to worry. You'll find that there is a movie titled Serenity which is just as awesome as the show. On top of that there are comic books that explains the story before the movie Serenity.Overall, the series is much loved by many people. I think any scifi fan should have Firefly in his or her collection. The show is simply awesome. There are many devoted fan sites as well, and the funny thing is that many fans are willing to donate cash so that they can create more episodes. The funnier thing is that I would be willing to pay into this fund if it means that there will be more episodes, that's how seriously you will become a fan if you see this show.",5,An awesome show!,1234569600,"02 14, 2009",2009,4731,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'hearing', 'off', 'years', 'Firefly', 'one', 'best', 'scifi', 'ever', ""'m"", 'always', 'skeptical', 'words', 'best', 'figured', ""'ll"", 'one', 'day', 'give', 'shot', 'saw', 'Firefly', 'sale', 'Amazon', '20', 'bucks', 'decided', 'had', 'nothing', 'lose', '20', 'odd', 'bucks', 's', 'h', 'hurt', 'not', 'getting', 'show', 'consist', 'fourteen', 'episodes', 'three', 'were', 'never', 'aired', 'television', 'Mal', 'crew', 'eight', 'who', 'odd', 'jobs', 'crew', 'member', 'unique', 'however', 'show', 'nine', 'characters', 'point', 'are', 'fourteen', 'episodes', 'get', 'see', 'thoughts', 'Serenity', 'Pilot', 'understanding', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'pilot', 'episode', 'series', 'instead', 'Tran', 'Job', 'got', 'pilot', 'due', 'management', 'issues', 'Serenity', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'movie', 'though', 'only', 'two', 'hours', 'episode', 'get', 'whole', 'Firefly', 'series.The', 'Train', 'Job', 'actual', 'pilot', 'was', 'shown', 'people', 'back', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'television', 'episode', 'interesting', 'things', 'Simon', 'River', 'two', 'interesting', 'characters', 'series.Bushwhacked', 'believe', 'first', 'time', 'hear', 'Reavers', 'are', 'really', 'space', 'pirates', 'twist', ""'re"", 'insane', 'psychotic', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'weird', 'stuff', 'people', 'capture.Shindig', 'pretty', 'funny', 'episode', 'think', 'episode', 'really', 'western', 'feel', 'series', 'swordplay', 'so', 'fort', 'interesting', 'watch.Safe', 'good', 'episode', 'depending', 'how', 'look', 'River', 'Simon', 'got', 'kidnapped', 'villagers', 'end', 'village', 'River', 'witch', 'burn', 'her.Our', 'Mrs', 'Reynolds', 'features', 'Saffron', 'who', 'Mal', 'nemesis', 'later', 'episode', 'Mal', 'married', 'crew', 'find', 'funny', 'woman', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'who', 'say', 'Features', 'fairly', 'funny', 'moment', 'Jayne', 'trying', 'trade', 'favorite', 'weapon', 'wife', 'fair', 'honest', 'trade.Jaynestown', 'character', 'named', 'Jayne', 'who', 'crew', 'muscle', 'tough', 'nails', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'brightest', 'Jayne', 'planet', 'only', 'find', 'think', 'sort', 'urban', 'legend', 'episode', 'think', 'series', 'focus', 'multiple', 'characters', 'how', 'detailed', 'creator', 'them.Out', 'Gas', 'Definitely', 'want', 'watch', 'sometime', 'seeing', 'Serenity', 'episode', 'interesting', 'back', 'stories', 'how', 'Mal', 'got', 'crew', 'together.Ariel', 'interesting', 'Simon', 'River', 'episode', 'crew', 'cure', 'River', 'illness.War', 'Stories', 'one', 'favorites', 'understand', 'episode', 'fully', ""'d"", 'probably', 'want', 'watch', 'Train', 'Job', 'first', 'ending', 'episode', 'got', 'sort', 'rushed', 'think', 'went', 'pretty', 'well', '43', 'minutes.Trash', ""'d"", 'want', 'watch', 'Mrs', 'Reynolds', 'first', 'before', 'watching', 'watched', 'episode', 'Mrs', 'Reynolds', 'was', 'bit', 'confused', 'first', 'However', ""'ll"", 'find', 'episode', 'funnier', 'watch', 'said', 'episode', 'first.The', 'Message', 'strange', 'episode', 'hated', 'many', 'fans', 'show', 'semi-weak', 'story', 'however', 'interestingly', 'also', 'bit', 'back', 'story', 'Mal', 'Zoe', 'when', 'fought', 'war', 'Independence', 'losing', 'side.Heart', 'Gold', 'series', 'Mal', 'Inara', 'have', 'sort', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'episode', 'sort', 'features', 'pretty', 'cool', 'link', 'two.Objects', 'Space', 'last', 'episodes', 'interesting', 'again', 'Simon', 'River', 'main', 'story.Those', 'are', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'sound', 'much', 'believe', 'watching', '14', 'episodes', 'will', 'probably', 'fall', 'love', 'show', 'probably', 'want', 'more', 'first', 'thought', 'came', 'mind', 'was', 'How', 'did', 'decide', 'cancel', 'awesome', 'show', 'quite', 'amazing', ""'m"", 'quite', 'baffled', 'how', 'someone', 'tv', 'network', 'could', 'just', 'drop', 'show', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'doubt', 'want', 'more', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', ""'ll"", 'find', 'movie', 'titled', 'Serenity', 'just', 'as', 'awesome', 'show', 'top', 'are', 'comic', 'books', 'story', 'movie', 'Serenity.Overall', 'series', 'much', 'loved', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'scifi', 'fan', 'should', 'have', 'Firefly', 'collection', 'show', 'simply', 'awesome', 'are', 'many', 'devoted', 'fan', 'sites', 'well', 'funny', 'thing', 'many', 'fans', 'are', 'willing', 'donate', 'cash', 'can', 'create', 'more', 'episodes', 'funnier', 'thing', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'pay', 'fund', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'episodes', 'how', 'seriously', 'will', 'become', 'fan', 'see', 'show']",N/A

This show has neither the duration to adequately explore character depth, nor an identifiable antagonist. Certainly, The Alliance serves as a looming threat and the Reavers are frightening to the characters. However, neither one has a face, someone or a group to despise. Star Trek had the Klingons and Romulans, TNG the Borg and Q, DS9 had the Cardassians and Dominion, and Voyager the Borg too. Babylon 5, DS9's competitor series, developed The Shadows. The point is, the enemies were apparent, and the strategies to battle them were developed, meeting with both failures and successes. In Firefly, the faces and ships were always different, always changing. The limited duration may have led to that, but it is a fundamental flaw in the production.

766036,A14FSB9QNWMKP1,B0000AQS0F,"Daniel Fazekas ""fds""","[7, 8]","Back in 2002, Firefly was the promising new sci-fi show on Fox cursed with such a horrible string of bad executive decisions, it's a miracle how it managed to gain a dedicated following. The network insisted on various changes to the show; they aired episodes in a different order than its creators intended; they even cropped the picture to a 4:3 aspect ratio for TV, although it was meant to be shown in widescreen. No wonder it eventually got canceled halfway through the season with three more episodes made but never aired.All this, I've only learned recently, as with 2005 came the release of Serenity, the motion picture, which has lead a whole new bunch of us to discover this interesting world. Having seen the movie, I was aching for more. As luck would have it, this time there actually was more: this very DVD set, Firefly - The Complete Series.I'm happy to say that it has exceeded my expectations in every way. On its own, the untimely cancellation of the show make Firefly hard to recommend without any reservations. Couple it with Serenity, however, and they make a thoroughly excellent package together. With Firefly, you get 675 more minutes of the same great cast of characters and many more of their interesting adventures, although each understandably somewhat less grandiose than that of the movie.Even the bonus features are impeccable. Of the 14 episodes, exactly half of them got a commentary track, each with a different set of people. Four of the cast are featured at least one once: Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk, Jewel Staite and Morena Baccarin. And of course, Joss Whedon, the brains behind the project, is along in three of them to share his thoughts. Beyond that, there's a gag reel, deleted scenes, behind the scenes features, and more.Really, the fact that this was released on 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, the same studio which so mistreated the show on TV, is no cause for concern. This DVD set does Firefly justice and treats it with the respect it always deserved.The bottom line is, you'll want to pick up both this and the Serenity DVD. That the two are unlikely to ever get officially bundled together is only because they were produced by different studios.",5,Great additional material for those of us who loved Serenity,1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,2205,"['Back', '2002', 'Firefly', 'was', 'promising', 'new', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'Fox', 'cursed', 'such', 'horrible', 'string', 'bad', 'executive', 'decisions', 'miracle', 'how', 'managed', 'gain', 'dedicated', 'following', 'network', 'insisted', 'various', 'changes', 'show', 'aired', 'episodes', 'different', 'order', 'creators', 'intended', 'even', 'cropped', 'picture', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'TV', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'shown', 'widescreen', 'wonder', 'eventually', 'got', 'canceled', 'halfway', 'season', 'three', 'more', 'episodes', 'made', 'never', ""'ve"", 'only', 'learned', 'recently', '2005', 'came', 'release', 'Serenity', 'motion', 'picture', 'lead', 'whole', 'new', 'bunch', 'discover', 'interesting', 'world', 'Having', 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'aching', 'more', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'time', 'actually', 'was', 'more', 'very', 'DVD', 'set', 'Firefly', 'Complete', 'Series.I', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'way', 'own', 'untimely', 'cancellation', 'show', 'make', 'Firefly', 'hard', 'recommend', 'reservations', 'Couple', 'Serenity', 'however', 'make', 'thoroughly', 'excellent', 'package', 'together', 'Firefly', 'get', '675', 'more', 'minutes', 'same', 'great', 'cast', 'characters', 'many', 'more', 'interesting', 'adventures', 'understandably', 'somewhat', 'less', 'grandiose', 'movie.Even', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'impeccable', '14', 'episodes', 'exactly', 'half', 'got', 'commentary', 'track', 'different', 'set', 'people', 'Four', 'cast', 'are', 'featured', 'least', 'one', 'once', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'Jewel', 'Staite', 'Morena', 'Baccarin', 'course', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'brains', 'project', 'along', 'three', 'share', 'thoughts', 'Beyond', 'gag', 'reel', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'features', 'more.Really', 'fact', 'was', 'released', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'same', 'studio', 'so', 'mistreated', 'show', 'TV', 'cause', 'concern', 'DVD', 'set', 'Firefly', 'justice', 'treats', 'respect', 'always', 'deserved.The', 'bottom', 'line', ""'ll"", 'want', 'pick', 'up', 'Serenity', 'DVD', 'two', 'are', 'unlikely', 'ever', 'get', 'officially', 'bundled', 'together', 'only', 'were', 'produced', 'different', 'studios']",N/A
766037,A1ZSUBG2HUUU9F,B0000AQS0F,Daniel,"[15, 16]","When I watch this series, I am always astonished at the amount of action, humor- be it good-natured and jovial, sardonic or dark- and good feelings packed into each 40 minute episode. It is truly incredible.Each character brings something truly special to the Serenity team- all nine of them, and you are amazed when you finally count them up, and realize that wow, there are NINE different, fleshed-out characters on this set, and you know and love all of them. And while they all have very distinct personalities, they all mesh together to form... with the risk of sounding clich&eacute;.. one big amazing family.Their fluid mix of Chinese (Mandarin) and English is truly impressive; expletives are muttered, yelled, screamed and whispered in Mandarin, but not so that you don't have a very good idea of what it is they're saying. This complements the English very well, and is a far superior tool than watered down words like ""darn!"" or, ""God forbid""- bleeps.Two mysteries remain by the end of the season, though; Book, the shepherd, and River, the little sister of Simon, the doctor. Of course, the captain, Mal, is a bit of a mystery himself, as is his touch-and-go relationship with Inara, the ""companion,"" but this is perhaps less of a dying curiosity than it is an interest, if that makes sense.Then there is Jayne, with his (yes, his) perpetual struggle with morals and greed. You come to love his crude, on-the-mark humor, and realize he is far more intelligent than he might first appear. You find yourself forgiving his short fallings, and rooting for him to do better by the crew and by himself (and I've never used the word ""rooting"" in any sentence, either spoken or written before in my life, so that should tell you something).You can really see the darkness is still very much a part of Mal- not an evil, but a darkness which has become part of his life ever since the war, ever since he watched thousands of his men die in battle, and of starvation, but this only shows when times are uneasy, unpleasant, uncertain.Perhaps the most lovable (and this is a very tough choice to make, believe you me, one's idea of who takes this crown will probably switch from episode to episode) is Kaylee, the adorable, always-cheerful, brilliant mechanic on board Serenity. She ""never fails to see the bright side of things,"" as Simon aptly puts it. Kaylee is a real marvel.However, you can't not fall in love with river, and feel her sorrow and pain when you see what has been done to her. She has some truly inspired lines, like, when talking to Jayne after Simon has just given him a lengthy diatribe: ""Also, I can destroy you with my brain."" She seems to have it out for Jayne, to be honest, though she probably doesn't always know what she's doing. As she rightly puts, ""Jayne is a girl's name.""You are immediately gripped, pulled into and riveted by the show as soon as you sit down and watch the beginning of the first episode.",5,"Probably the best TV series I have ever seen, period.",1135036800,"12 20, 2005",2005,2938,"['When', 'watch', 'series', 'am', 'always', 'astonished', 'amount', 'action', 'humor-', 'be', 'good-natured', 'jovial', 'sardonic', 'dark-', 'good', 'feelings', 'packed', '40', 'minute', 'episode', 'truly', 'incredible.Each', 'character', 'something', 'truly', 'special', 'Serenity', 'team-', 'nine', 'are', 'amazed', 'when', 'finally', 'count', 'up', 'realize', 'wow', 'are', 'NINE', 'different', 'fleshed-out', 'characters', 'set', 'know', 'love', 'have', 'very', 'distinct', 'personalities', 'mesh', 'together', 'form', 'risk', 'sounding', 'clich', 'eacute', 'one', 'big', 'amazing', 'family.Their', 'fluid', 'mix', 'Chinese', 'Mandarin', 'English', 'truly', 'impressive', 'expletives', 'are', 'muttered', 'yelled', 'screamed', 'whispered', 'Mandarin', 'not', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'what', ""'re"", 'saying', 'English', 'very', 'well', 'far', 'superior', 'tool', 'watered', 'down', 'words', 'darn', 'God', 'forbid', 'bleeps.Two', 'mysteries', 'remain', 'end', 'season', 'though', 'Book', 'shepherd', 'River', 'little', 'sister', 'Simon', 'doctor', 'course', 'captain', 'Mal', 'bit', 'mystery', 'touch-and-go', 'relationship', 'Inara', 'companion', 'perhaps', 'less', 'dying', 'curiosity', 'interest', 'sense.Then', 'Jayne', 'yes', 'perpetual', 'struggle', 'morals', 'greed', 'come', 'love', 'crude', 'on-the-mark', 'humor', 'realize', 'far', 'more', 'intelligent', 'might', 'first', 'appear', 'find', 'forgiving', 'short', 'fallings', 'rooting', 'do', 'better', 'crew', ""'ve"", 'never', 'used', 'word', 'rooting', 'sentence', 'either', 'spoken', 'written', 'life', 'should', 'tell', 'something', '.You', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'darkness', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'Mal-', 'not', 'evil', 'darkness', 'become', 'part', 'life', 'ever', 'war', 'ever', 'watched', 'thousands', 'men', 'die', 'battle', 'starvation', 'only', 'when', 'times', 'are', 'uneasy', 'unpleasant', 'most', 'lovable', 'very', 'tough', 'choice', 'make', 'believe', 'one', 'idea', 'who', 'crown', 'will', 'probably', 'switch', 'episode', 'episode', 'Kaylee', 'adorable', 'always-cheerful', 'brilliant', 'mechanic', 'board', 'Serenity', 'never', 'see', 'bright', 'side', 'things', 'Simon', 'aptly', 'Kaylee', 'real', 'marvel.However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'river', 'feel', 'sorrow', 'pain', 'when', 'see', 'been', 'done', 'truly', 'inspired', 'lines', 'when', 'talking', 'Jayne', 'Simon', 'just', 'given', 'lengthy', 'diatribe', 'Also', 'can', 'destroy', 'brain', 'have', 'out', 'Jayne', 'be', 'honest', 'probably', ""n't"", 'always', 'know', 'what', 'doing', 'rightly', 'Jayne', 'girl', 'name', 'are', 'immediately', 'gripped', 'pulled', 'riveted', 'show', 'as', 'soon', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'beginning', 'first', 'episode']",N/A

I saw the whole series in 3 days while trying to expand the experience. I Fell in love with the Characters and I LOVE the music and the Theme Song blew me away. I LOVE THAT SONG, it's one of the best theme song I ever heard. It's too bad that it was short, I wanted more and more. I'm happy they made the Movie, as it does Rock and it makes more sense after watching the series. Don't see the movie first, watch the series first and then the movie. I LOVE this show, One of my favorite show ever.It's about a group of Law Breakers stealing and doing anything for money and Hopping through the Galaxy finding anything to make money.

With a young family I am dissapointed that I can not share this show with them. Another point of discouragement is the line of language in Mandarin Chinese whenever a character is upset.The main spine of this story is the captian with an old war buddy decide to go into business with the purchase of an old spaceship. A ""professional harlot"" rents out one of the two empty shuttles to expedite her business to foreign climes. Others whom are aleady on the crew is an egotistical hothead, a female mechanic with other things on her mind, a man of the cloth with a past, and a sister and brother. The brother is a doctor and a genius and the sister is more so, but was freed from the government.The spine of the story is almost non-existent. The captian and his female war-buddy story is given in short. The same is so later on with the different crew members. Otherwise, they are just floating in space as an illegal salvage team. The enemy is the republic which is set up more or less like Scotland Yard. Now, when the writer and director were bored decided to put this graphic sex scene here or there. Or the topic of sex was brought up in the crew's conversation on deck. A nude scene here to perpetuate reality. A nude scene there to express the realism as the writer and director thinks would make the story more real. And then there was the sceme where the harlot has intiment relations with another girl, and the captain upright and completely nude in front of all because in an earlier show a ""marriage"" had taken place and the gal was nude.Otherwise, the storyline has no true spine. As with the movie Supernova with Lou Diamond Phillips and with the first season of Stargate Universe with (once again) Lou Damon Phillips and Peter DeLuise released a show not for the public at large but for the adult audiences, and the same holds true with the television show Firefly created by Josh Whedon.In short, such shows could be surmised as a group of fish stuck in a can.

The stories themselves are in one way stereotypical, and yet in another way very original; I guess you would have to watch them to see what I mean.I'm pleased with them and look forward to seeing them again; a lot is going on and it's hard to absorb all of the action on a first viewing.If you're a sci-fi fan and have not seen the series and the movie, you should go ahead and treat yourself.",4,A Science Fiction Western?,1216252800,"07 17, 2008",2008,1558,"['Somehow', 'missed', 'Firefly', 'when', 'was', 'aired', 'TV', 'When', 'movie', 'Serenity', 'came', 'out', 'got', 'DVD', 'copy', 'watched', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'reading', 'cover', 'very', 'carefully', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'connection', 'TV', 'series', 'Firefly.While', 'browsing', 'Amazon', 'web', 'site', 'DVDs', 'noticed', 'Firefly', 'set', 'contained', 'TV', 'episodes', 'review', 'intrigued', 'decided', 'order', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'DVD.One', 'reviewers', 'said', 'was', 'best', 'watch', 'TV', 'series', 'watching', 'movie', 'decided', 'do', 'just', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', 'past', 'had', 'been', 'fairly', 'long', 'time', 'started', 'TV', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'store', 'me.If', 'one', 'premise', 'reasonable', 'frontiers', 'space', 'could', 'have', 'parallels', 'frontiers', 'old', 'West', 'farther', 'got', 'away', 'civilization', 'more', 'rugged', 'life', 'could', 'become', 'especially', 'major', 'war', 'had', 'divided', 'civilization.To', 'substantial', 'degree', 'check', 'brain', 'door', 'just', 'relax', 'accept', 'story', 'line', 'characters', 'are', 'sufficiently', 'developed', 'generate', 'feelings', 'concern', 'stories', 'progress', 'stories', 'are', 'one', 'way', 'stereotypical', 'yet', 'way', 'very', 'original', 'guess', 'would', 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'what', 'mean.I', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'again', 'lot', 'going', 'hard', 'absorb', 'action', 'first', 'viewing.If', ""'re"", 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'series', 'movie', 'should', 'go', 'ahead', 'treat']",N/A

This show was obviously genre-bending, combining sci-fi with a Western feel, which is probably why it was cancelled: it couldn't be pidgeon-holed by (or for) a network executive.  But it's uniqueness, you might even say its quirkiness, is part of its charm.Another thing that might have contributed to its demise was its inability to maintain a consistent tone.

Some episodes are better than others - the ones scripted by Whedon tend to be the best - but the series overall is better than almost everything on TV today.

At first glance, it seems like a sci fi--which isn't really my type of tv show.  But i am glad that i got this DVD- this is not your typical space/sci-fi/futuristic show.Firefly is set in the future, but unlike other space shows, it has a different feel.  Space is actually quiet and soundless.  The future seems to be dominated by Chinese. There are high tech weapons (lasers and hovercrafts) but also guns, horses and a western feel to some of the episodes.  This is a view of the future that is quite different from most space shows- more grittier, more real, more of a struggle to survive.The strength of the show comes from the characters and their interactions with each other--they just happen to be on a space ship.  ( i should have known that any show by Joss Whedom would be one of relationships, diaglogue and struggle)Firefly tells the tale of a rag tag bunch of outcasts who are on a ship (Serenity).  They are lead by their Captain Malcolm and his first mate Zoe (both would be familiar to fans as Caleb from Buffy's last season and Darla's child from angel-i forget her name.)Joining them are Walsh (zoe's husband), a doctor and his sister, Kaylee (the mechanic) and Jayne (a kind of mercenary).  Also on board is a preacher and Inara ""a companion"" prostitute.Together this group flies around doing odd jobs- some legal, some not.  They are avoiding the alliance (a quasi govenment bad guy), some strange blue handed men and ""reavers"" ( sort of space pirates-murderers) as well as their own enemies.Like all of JW's shows, the human element and relationships are ones that any viewer will be drawn to- the struggle between Walsh and Zoe's marriage (walsh can't believe that he has married such a beatiful and strong woman when he is the opposite):  the deep respect and trust between Zoe and Malcolm:  the budding romance between Kaylee and the doctor:  Inara and Malcolm's tension and attraction:  and all of them has to intereact and deal with River- the disturbed sister of the doctor who was rescued from the alliance and is being pursued by them.This DVD set contains 14 episodes as well as the usual DVD extras including the making of firefly, Joss Whedom's comments,a gag reel,  deleted scenes etc.  It is interesting to watch and imagine where this series was headed before it got cancelled- but JW himself hints that there may be another reincarnation of Firefly (another series ??a film ??).**also there is a hidden easter egg--jayne singing the folk song about him, on the last disc**So if you are a fan of good drama, intriguing characters, and witty diaglogue..get this DVD.

It took a good way into the second disc to start making connections about what was really going on and how the whole series worked.However once, I finally got into the characters, I got into the entire storyline. I needed something from them to make be want to see what they were doing next. In some cases it was a story arc, in others a few quick and simple catchy lines did the trick finally.Now I wish I had about 13 more episodes to continue a lot of unanswered questions and stories that this series left hanging.

766086,A3DIKJP95XTKX0,B0000AQS0F,"D. I. Shipley ""David Shipley""","[12, 15]","I picked up all 14 episodes of Firefly after having seen Serenity in the cinema. Like the film, the tv series Firefly is a truly great piece of Sci Fi. Funny, wry, touching, poignant, frightening and scary are all adjectives that apply to Firefly.It is also an example of the genre making serious social comment, for example the struggles of the individuals who crew the Firefly class freighter - Serenity against the politically correct and interfering Alliance Government, an entity that appears to be colluding with, or even in hock to Mega Corporations.Now I wonder just where the parody could be there....Sadly this boldness probably contributed to the show's early demise though.Set 500 years in the future, amidst strong undertones of the Old West, Mankind has colonised planets and moons beyond the Earth. A recent war between the Separatists and the Alliance Government has ended with total victory for the latter.Despite being peaceful and benign on the outside, the Alliance is completely ruthless in going about its aims, and tends to step on anyone who gets in its way.Eking out an existence among the outer rim planets, is Captain Mal Reynolds and his crew of largely former Separatists. Nathan Fillion makes for a wry and sarcastic Mal Reynolds, even if the character does nod towards Han Solo at times. Among his crew are Simon, a young doctor and his sister River who is a volatile psychic. Both are being hunted by The Alliance. On board the Firefly class freighter - Serenity, this crew smuggle various cargo and take passengers on a 'no questions asked' basis.Like the film, the tv series casts the characters as real people and this makes them so identifiable and likeable. When they have their rough moments, the viewers tends to find themselves caring about them and their fate.Apart from The Alliance, the crew of the Serenity have to contend with hordes of Reavers. These are horribly mutated space cannibals who raid and pillage, with the intention of capturing people, so as to eat them alive......The main reason for cancelling the show so early into its initial run would be appear to be an attack of gutlessness at Fox, where a company which is normally very pro Government simply did not want a show that advanced the individual, and cast the government into the role of aggressor/villain.The series did not pull in significant viewing figures but other shows have run with less viewers for an entire season, and have then been allowed to build.... So why not this particular series?A suggestion for the poor figures is a boycott by enraged Buffy and Angel fans who were trying to make a point to Joss Whedon, for cancelling both of their favourite series at this time.Another suggestion for the poor figures though is just how much promotional effort did Fox actually put into the show?I still believe though that the decision to cancel by Fox was probably driven by internal politicking, combined with the already mentioned unhappiness with a tv series that portrayed government in the role of the villain. It is a shame because if Serenity had been allowed to build, then it could have gone on to be as big as either Buffy or Angel.This is a puzzle though because Fox has continually supported the Simpsons which has never been afraid of political satire.....Universal now own the rights to the big screen versions and apparently two more are planned after Serenity. I for one certainly look forward to seeing them. Maybe Fox would consider selling on the tv rights to someone else who would be prepared to make a go of it.Anyway  do see Firefly and Serenity for yourself, if you have yet to do so, and be entranced by the unique charm, character, and riveting plots that the tv series and film have to offer. I believe that you will seldom find a more rewarding viewing experience.",5,Has its place in the Pantheon of great Sci Fi shows,1149552000,"06 6, 2006",2006,3816,"['picked', 'up', 'all', '14', 'episodes', 'Firefly', 'having', 'seen', 'Serenity', 'cinema', 'film', 'tv', 'series', 'Firefly', 'truly', 'great', 'piece', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Funny', 'wry', 'touching', 'poignant', 'frightening', 'scary', 'are', 'adjectives', 'apply', 'Firefly.It', 'also', 'example', 'genre', 'making', 'serious', 'social', 'comment', 'example', 'struggles', 'individuals', 'who', 'crew', 'Firefly', 'class', 'freighter', 'Serenity', 'politically', 'correct', 'interfering', 'Alliance', 'Government', 'entity', 'be', 'colluding', 'even', 'hock', 'Mega', 'Corporations.Now', 'wonder', 'just', 'where', 'parody', 'could', 'be', 'there', '.Sadly', 'boldness', 'probably', 'contributed', 'show', 'early', 'demise', 'though.Set', '500', 'years', 'future', 'amidst', 'strong', 'undertones', 'Old', 'West', 'Mankind', 'colonised', 'planets', 'moons', 'Earth', 'recent', 'war', 'Separatists', 'Alliance', 'Government', 'ended', 'total', 'victory', 'latter.Despite', 'being', 'peaceful', 'benign', 'outside', 'Alliance', 'completely', 'ruthless', 'going', 'aims', 'step', 'anyone', 'who', 'way.Eking', 'out', 'existence', 'outer', 'rim', 'planets', 'Captain', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'crew', 'largely', 'former', 'Separatists', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'wry', 'sarcastic', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'even', 'character', 'nod', 'towards', 'Han', 'Solo', 'times', 'crew', 'are', 'Simon', 'young', 'doctor', 'sister', 'River', 'who', 'volatile', 'psychic', 'are', 'being', 'hunted', 'Alliance', 'board', 'Firefly', 'class', 'freighter', 'Serenity', 'crew', 'various', 'cargo', 'take', 'passengers', ""'no"", 'questions', 'asked', 'film', 'tv', 'series', 'characters', 'real', 'people', 'so', 'identifiable', 'likeable', 'When', 'have', 'rough', 'moments', 'viewers', 'find', 'caring', 'fate.Apart', 'Alliance', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'have', 'contend', 'hordes', 'Reavers', 'are', 'horribly', 'mutated', 'space', 'cannibals', 'who', 'raid', 'pillage', 'intention', 'capturing', 'people', 'so', 'eat', 'alive', 'main', 'reason', 'cancelling', 'show', 'so', 'early', 'initial', 'run', 'would', 'be', 'appear', 'be', 'attack', 'gutlessness', 'Fox', 'where', 'company', 'normally', 'very', 'pro', 'Government', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'show', 'advanced', 'individual', 'cast', 'government', 'role', 'aggressor/villain.The', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'pull', 'significant', 'viewing', 'figures', 'other', 'shows', 'have', 'run', 'less', 'viewers', 'entire', 'season', 'have', 'then', 'been', 'allowed', 'build', 'So', 'why', 'not', 'particular', 'series', 'suggestion', 'poor', 'figures', 'boycott', 'enraged', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'fans', 'who', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'cancelling', 'favourite', 'series', 'time.Another', 'suggestion', 'poor', 'figures', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'promotional', 'effort', 'did', 'Fox', 'actually', 'put', 'show', 'still', 'believe', 'decision', 'cancel', 'Fox', 'was', 'probably', 'driven', 'internal', 'politicking', 'combined', 'already', 'mentioned', 'unhappiness', 'tv', 'series', 'portrayed', 'government', 'role', 'villain', 'shame', 'Serenity', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'build', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'be', 'as', 'big', 'Buffy', 'Angel.This', 'puzzle', 'Fox', 'continually', 'supported', 'Simpsons', 'never', 'been', 'afraid', 'political', 'satire', '..Universal', 'now', 'own', 'rights', 'big', 'screen', 'versions', 'apparently', 'two', 'more', 'are', 'planned', 'Serenity', 'one', 'certainly', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Maybe', 'Fox', 'would', 'consider', 'selling', 'tv', 'rights', 'someone', 'else', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'prepared', 'make', 'go', 'it.Anyway', 'do', 'see', 'Firefly', 'Serenity', 'have', 'yet', 'do', 'so', 'be', 'entranced', 'unique', 'charm', 'character', 'riveting', 'plots', 'tv', 'series', 'film', 'have', 'offer', 'believe', 'will', 'seldom', 'find', 'more', 'rewarding', 'viewing', 'experience']",N/A

And then It disappeared from existence never to be heard from again, until now.  A fellow cashier bought it and told me it was awesome and since I like some Science Fiction shows, I thought maybe I should...and I did.  This is one of the best scifi shows ever created.  What it is is a science fiction western in space.  There are no alien races or anything, it's just human who teraformed various planets to inhabit themselves and they colonized out there (ie: the wild west in space).It's really creative and has some very interesting characters.  Like the captain who has personal issues, his first woman who always follows orders, her husband who's a wimpy funny guy, and the very attractive &quot;space hooker.&quot;  There's others and things get really complicated when they pick up a doctor and his sister who are wanted by the Alliance (the typical corrupt gov't power).If you like science fiction, westerns, and some comedy...you need to get this.

Joss Whedon has created an incredibly believable world, a surprisingly effective mixture of the Old West with Science Fiction, with an ensemble of character actors at its heart that shine as brightly as the cutting-edge special effects surrounding them.  The writing in this show is exceptional.  The acting is superb all around, even all the guest actors that show up give good performances.  The only gripe I may have had with the creation of the show is all the hand-held cinematography.  But this show is a different animal.  They mix in the special effects shots with the same type of camera-work, as if some bystander is capturing all the effects as they happen, which makes for an immediate feel to the scene, special effects and all.  The idea is ingenious, and the fact that the visual effects are all top-notch and extremely expensive make this one of the most effective Science Fiction shows ever created.  If you love great Science Fiction with action, humor, excellent writing, solid acting and a collection of some of the finest visual effects creatively rendered then look no further than ""Firefly"" for a solid Sci-fi fix.  I will warn all newcomers, however, that this is all they made before the show was cancelled.  Believe me, with a show this well-made, the episodes burn up by like a brushfire on a windy day.

Work among other things kept me from watching more than a handful of episodes before the abrupt cancelation, but what I did see had me intrigued.  At least, I'd figured I'd be able to catch up on enough reruns before the next season started to fully understand what was going on.  Obviously that was a bad plan on my part, so thank god someone wised up and decided to put this series out on DVD.The acting is stellar, which is surprising considering, with the exception of Adam Baldwin, Gina Torres, and Alan Tudyk, I'd never heard of most of them.The slowly revealed plot of the series, as well as the individual episode storylines were all intriguing concepts as well.The down side?  Television wasn't ready for a serial science fiction show when this came out.  We'd spent too many years raised on crap like Star Trek, whose storyline ended after an episode or two.

766120,A17D77DFID0GZG,B0000AQS0F,"dsrussell ""greyhater""","[4, 4]","Over 3,000 reviews and counting. So here is my two cents (soon to be lost in a sea of thousands of other pennies).Like many, I never saw this short-lived series when it first aired. I never saw BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, nor ANGEL, nor have I watched the current DOLLHOUSE. Joss Whedon? Who is he? Then again, I don't watch any TV series on a regular basis because I don't make an effort to know what day or what time they are on. If a TV program comes on, I may watch it if it interests me, otherwise I move on to something else or pop in a movie (I also missed the entire 4-year run of BSG, but bought that series just recently). So how did I come to see this series?Well, it started when I rented the movie SERENITY on a lark, and the film surprising me. A western in space? Sure, why not? It makes perfect sense to me, and I liked the movie OUTLAND (which was HIGH NOON in space). And while I like good science fiction and a good western, I usually don't see both in one movie. Plus, the heroes (I use the word loosely) in this film are an odd mix of pirates, thieves, a man of God, and even a prostitute, but all have some sort of code of ethics ... well all except for the character, Jayne;).Did I feel SERENITY was a great movie? Nope, but it was sure a heck of a lot of fun and had some really witty writing (I ended up purchasing the dvd simply because I felt it was a movie I could enjoy repeat viewings). So what happened? My son mentioned FIREFLY and lent me the series. Turns out that is the worse thing that could have happened. Why? Because I slowly began to get very involved with the series and its characters (this wasn't immediate, it took me several episodes). Of course I bought the dvd set. That was a no-brainer. But I'm a bit bummed. Once I watched the entire series, I knew there would be no more episodes. No more FIREFLY. No more SERENITY. No more witty dialog popping up at the most unexpected times and places. At least I now know who Joss Whedon is.This series is now classified at cult status (like the original STAR TREK when it was cancelled after the third season). Perhaps its status came about because its life was cut so short (it didn't run for even one full season, and one can ""thank"" FOX for this blunder). There wasn't enough time to muck it up, but enough time to get one hooked. There were also many questions that need to be fleshed out (the River character especially, but also Shepherd Book, as well as the shadowy agency in the Alliance -- ""two by two hands of blue"").Is it really a 5-star series? No, probably not. The acting varies from being a bit stiff at times to very good, but the cast really grows on you as you watch. I mean, how can one not like the slow witted and out-for-yourself Jayne? Or the soldier woman Zoe? Or Mal? Or ... you get the idea. But let's face it, not every episode is a gem, but even the worst ones were entertaining. My favorite episode, and I have several, is ""Out of Gas"". I rarely have belly laughs when watching a western or science fiction (although the new STAR TREK movie was just as witty), so I'll just call FIREFLY refreshing with its wide variety of very different characters (some with mysterious or murky backgrounds) packed on a run down boat in space. So yes, FIREFLY is worth a 9 out of 10 (or a 5-star rating) in my book. And from the reviews I see here, I guess I'm not alone when I felt twinges of sadness and wanting to see more. And because it won't happen, I consider that realization a bummer.",5,Bummer.,1268784000,"03 17, 2010",2010,3495,"['3,000', 'reviews', 'counting', 'So', 'here', 'two', 'cents', 'soon', 'be', 'lost', 'sea', 'thousands', 'other', 'pennies', '.Like', 'many', 'never', 'saw', 'short-lived', 'series', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'never', 'saw', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'ANGEL', 'have', 'watched', 'current', 'DOLLHOUSE', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Who', 'Then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'TV', 'series', 'regular', 'basis', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'effort', 'know', 'what', 'day', 'what', 'time', 'are', 'TV', 'program', 'may', 'watch', 'interests', 'otherwise', 'move', 'something', 'else', 'pop', 'movie', 'also', 'missed', 'entire', '4-year', 'run', 'BSG', 'bought', 'series', 'just', 'recently', 'how', 'did', 'come', 'see', 'series', 'Well', 'started', 'when', 'rented', 'movie', 'SERENITY', 'lark', 'film', 'surprising', 'western', 'space', 'Sure', 'why', 'not', 'perfect', 'sense', 'liked', 'movie', 'OUTLAND', 'was', 'HIGH', 'NOON', 'space', 'like', 'good', 'science', 'fiction', 'good', 'western', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'movie', 'heroes', 'use', 'word', 'loosely', 'film', 'are', 'odd', 'mix', 'pirates', 'thieves', 'man', 'God', 'even', 'prostitute', 'have', 'sort', 'code', 'ethics', 'well', 'character', 'Jayne', '.Did', 'feel', 'SERENITY', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'Nope', 'was', 'sure', 'heck', 'lot', 'fun', 'had', 'really', 'witty', 'writing', 'ended', 'up', 'purchasing', 'dvd', 'simply', 'felt', 'was', 'movie', 'could', 'enjoy', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'what', 'happened', 'My', 'son', 'mentioned', 'FIREFLY', 'lent', 'series', 'out', 'worse', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'Why', 'slowly', 'began', 'get', 'very', 'involved', 'series', 'characters', 'was', ""n't"", 'immediate', 'took', 'several', 'episodes', 'course', 'bought', 'dvd', 'set', 'was', 'no-brainer', ""'m"", 'bit', 'bummed', 'Once', 'watched', 'entire', 'series', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'episodes', 'more', 'FIREFLY', 'No', 'more', 'SERENITY', 'No', 'more', 'witty', 'dialog', 'popping', 'up', 'most', 'unexpected', 'times', 'places', 'least', 'now', 'know', 'who', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'is.This', 'series', 'now', 'classified', 'cult', 'status', 'original', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'when', 'was', 'cancelled', 'third', 'season', 'Perhaps', 'status', 'came', 'about', 'life', 'was', 'cut', 'so', 'short', 'did', ""n't"", 'run', 'even', 'one', 'full', 'season', 'one', 'can', 'thank', 'FOX', 'blunder', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'muck', 'up', 'enough', 'time', 'get', 'one', 'hooked', 'were', 'also', 'many', 'questions', 'need', 'be', 'fleshed', 'out', 'River', 'character', 'especially', 'also', 'Shepherd', 'Book', 'as', 'well', 'shadowy', 'agency', 'Alliance', 'two', 'two', 'hands', 'blue', '.Is', 'really', '5-star', 'series', 'No', 'probably', 'not', 'acting', 'varies', 'being', 'bit', 'stiff', 'times', 'very', 'good', 'cast', 'really', 'watch', 'mean', 'how', 'can', 'one', 'not', 'slow', 'witted', 'out-for-yourself', 'Jayne', 'soldier', 'woman', 'Zoe', 'Mal', 'get', 'idea', 'let', 'face', 'not', 'episode', 'gem', 'even', 'worst', 'ones', 'were', 'entertaining', 'favorite', 'episode', 'have', 'several', 'Gas', 'rarely', 'have', 'belly', 'laughs', 'when', 'watching', 'western', 'science', 'fiction', 'new', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'witty', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'call', 'FIREFLY', 'refreshing', 'wide', 'variety', 'very', 'different', 'characters', 'mysterious', 'murky', 'backgrounds', 'packed', 'run', 'down', 'boat', 'space', 'So', 'yes', 'FIREFLY', '9', '10', '5-star', 'rating', 'book', 'reviews', 'see', 'here', 'guess', ""'m"", 'not', 'alone', 'when', 'felt', 'twinges', 'sadness', 'wanting', 'see', 'more', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen', 'consider', 'realization', 'bummer']",N/A

I have a theory that sometimes it is best for a show to burn out bright before it gets stale, as with Futurama, but Firefly was never even given the chance to hit its maximum illumination.  Running the second episode first instead of the awesome 2 hour premier?  Stupid.  Dropping the viewers right into the middle of the world without even knowing the characters?  STUPID!Recomendation:  Buy the set and watch all 14 excellent epidodes in the order intended.  This show takes Star Trek tech, smashed it with the used look of Star Wars (Original Trilogy) and throws in the wild west for good measure.  In the middle of all this we meet a band of charming and intricate characters that Joss was able to have us care about in the very first episode on the DVD.  The cast is 100% excellent all the way around.The wild west theme seems strange at first but grows on you very quickly.  It kind of makes sense too.  Sure we have space faring tech but we just terra-formed this planet to colonize and dumped people on it so yeah they live in shacks and ride horses and use what's available.  Sure it might be a desert, its probably hard to terra-form a dead planet to green Earth specs.  It would take time for a planet to be changed in that way.Technological aspects aside the show is just awesome.  The characters and dialog shine and you just end up loving them.  By the third epidose you're laughing along with their in-jokes and care about their lives.  Not many a show can pull this off.  Serenity has the best captain around.  You might say he's a bad/nice guy like others try to be in other shows but never have I seen it pulled off so well.  You just know that Malcom Reynolds will try everything he can for a peaceful resolution but if he has to kill you he won't mind.The concept of America and China forming the basis of the planetary Alliance is also original.  Its cool that when the characters get upset or curse the lapse into Chinese.  Think of the Alliance as the Federation from Star Trek and the browncoats or border planets as rebels who hate those tight pants bureaucrates meddling and you get the idea.I could go on forever and it seems just amazing that all this was presented in only 14 episodes.

It was by Josh and he didn't do too bad with buffy and angel.  Silly at times, but pretty cool at others.So, here's my review:It was a little tough to get into at first.  I think the first four to six episodes the cast was a little fresh and starting to discover their characters and roles.  The stoy itself is also a little fantastic.  The thing is, around the fourth or fifth episode, you stop noticing that so much.  I began to accept this as a fun fantasy.As the story continued, the crew seemed to gel more.  The story lines are pretty interesting, and really... it's a show about having fun watching it.The fight scenes are a little silly, but i think that may have been by choice.  After all, this is a space cowboy movie... and the cowboy always stood there as bullets missed and he hit.  Well.. .actually they do end up hitting a bit.  I found it funny that when the captain was naked, there were no scars...The universe of this story has it's laws, and the show does a good job of sticking to the laws of the world it's created.It takes a few viewings to get into.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","&#34;Firefly&#34; is exactly the kind of science-fiction series that you'd expect Joss Whedon to make -- a sort of reverse &#34;Star Trek&#34; with a wild, untidy cast of characters.And it's not hard to see why it developed such a fanatical fanbase, even though it lasted a measly fourteen episodes -- magnificent writing (&#34;... if your hand touches metal, I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you.&#34;), well-developed characters, and a somewhat more realistic approach to a sci-fi western. It's a shame that the series never got to unfold to its full potential.It takes place about five centuries from now, far from &#34;Earth that was.&#34; Many planets are ruled by the Alliance, an authoritative military/corporate government that forces various planets into a unified force, which some planets are not terribly crazy about. And in &#34;the black&#34; of interstellar space, there are cannibalistic savage Reavers.The story takes place on the spaceship Firefly, whose crew mostly make a living out of smuggling and/or carrying cargo. They're a motley bunch -- including the captain &#34;Mal&#34; and first mate Zoe, who are war veterans (Nathan Fillion and Gina Torres), courtesan-like &#34;Companion&#34; Inara (Morena Baccarin), goofy pilot Wash (Alan Tudyk), a menacing mercenary Jayne (Adam Baldwin), mysterious priest Book (Ron Glass), fugitive doctor Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and his possibly-insane sister River (Summer Glau).This odd band of people roams through various worlds, which have a sort of Wild-West-by-way-of-space-opera atmosphere. They must deal with crimelords, the Reavers, duels, kidnappings, a devious woman who claims to be married to Mal, Jayne's folk legend status, and the Alliance itself -- who have a mysterious and sinister interest in the Tam siblings.As much as I love some Star Trek series (specifically the original and &#34;Deep Space Nine&#34;), they rarely show people who fall outside the Federation and its rather smug authoritarian approach. &#34;Firefly&#34; is the exact opposite -- their enemies are the domineering alliance of planets who think everyone should be like them, and the Firefly crew glory in living a life of freedom and unpredictable semi-criminality.In the &#34;Firefly&#34; universe, technology hasn't changed who and what people are; people still grapple with the same ethical, moral, religious and political issues that we have now, and always have had. Cruelty and kindness exist in the same measure, and people still ultimately look out for themselves -- and nobody is perfect. Even their enemies have a shade of moral greyness.And of course, Joss Whedon brings his usual flair to the story -- butt-kicking action scenes, grotesque horror, a hint of conspiracy, and bucketloads of quotable dialogue (&#34;Yeah, we should start dealing in those black-market beagles&#34;) that ranges from the rough'n'ready Wild West lingo to the hilarious (&#34;Baby geese. Goslings. They were juggled&#34;).The characters are a motley family of sorts -- they don't always agree or even necessarily like each other, but they are (mostly) unified. Their colorful different jobs (ritualized sex worker, ex-soldiers, merc, doctor, priest) allow them to have even more varied backstories. All the actors do excellent jobs -- Nathan Fillion, Morena Baccarin, Alan Tudyk and Sean Maher all give particularly good performances. The most exceptional is Glau's River, a damaged young woman who says mad things about cows and wears pretty floaty dresses.&#34;Firefly: The Complete Series&#34; is a slice of rich, witty sci-fi that sadly had only a brief moment in the sun. In a fairer world, this would have gone on for years while tedious reality shows crashed and burned.",5,"""Yeah... that went well.""",1402012800,"06 6, 2014",2014,3729,"['34', 'Firefly', '34', 'exactly', 'kind', 'science-fiction', 'series', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'make', 'sort', 'reverse', '34', 'Star', 'Trek', '34', 'wild', 'untidy', 'cast', 'characters.And', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'developed', 'fanatical', 'fanbase', 'even', 'lasted', 'measly', 'fourteen', 'episodes', 'magnificent', 'writing', '34', 'hand', 'touches', 'metal', 'swear', 'pretty', 'floral', 'bonnet', 'will', 'end', 'you.', '34', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'somewhat', 'more', 'realistic', 'approach', 'sci-fi', 'western', 'shame', 'series', 'never', 'got', 'unfold', 'full', 'potential.It', 'place', 'five', 'centuries', 'now', 'far', '34', 'Earth', 'was.', '34', 'Many', 'planets', 'are', 'ruled', 'Alliance', 'authoritative', 'military/corporate', 'government', 'various', 'planets', 'unified', 'force', 'planets', 'are', 'not', 'terribly', 'crazy', '34', 'black', '34', 'interstellar', 'space', 'are', 'cannibalistic', 'savage', 'Reavers.The', 'story', 'place', 'spaceship', 'Firefly', 'crew', 'mostly', 'make', 'living', 'smuggling', 'and/or', 'carrying', 'cargo', ""'re"", 'motley', 'bunch', 'including', 'captain', '34', 'Mal', '34', 'first', 'mate', 'Zoe', 'who', 'are', 'war', 'veterans', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'courtesan-like', '34', 'Companion', '34', 'Inara', 'Morena', 'Baccarin', 'goofy', 'pilot', 'Wash', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'menacing', 'mercenary', 'Jayne', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'mysterious', 'priest', 'Book', 'Ron', 'Glass', 'fugitive', 'doctor', 'Simon', 'Tam', 'Sean', 'Maher', 'possibly-insane', 'sister', 'River', 'Summer', 'Glau', '.This', 'odd', 'band', 'people', 'roams', 'various', 'worlds', 'have', 'sort', 'Wild-West-by-way-of-space-opera', 'atmosphere', 'must', 'deal', 'crimelords', 'Reavers', 'duels', 'kidnappings', 'devious', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'married', 'Mal', 'Jayne', 'folk', 'legend', 'status', 'Alliance', 'who', 'have', 'mysterious', 'sinister', 'interest', 'Tam', 'siblings.As', 'much', 'love', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'specifically', 'original', '34', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', '34', 'rarely', 'show', 'people', 'who', 'fall', 'Federation', 'rather', 'smug', 'authoritarian', 'approach', '34', 'Firefly', '34', 'exact', 'opposite', 'enemies', 'are', 'domineering', 'alliance', 'planets', 'who', 'think', 'everyone', 'should', 'be', 'Firefly', 'crew', 'glory', 'living', 'life', 'freedom', 'unpredictable', 'semi-criminality.In', '34', 'Firefly', '34', 'universe', 'technology', ""n't"", 'changed', 'who', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'people', 'still', 'grapple', 'same', 'ethical', 'moral', 'religious', 'political', 'issues', 'have', 'now', 'always', 'have', 'had', 'Cruelty', 'kindness', 'exist', 'same', 'measure', 'people', 'still', 'ultimately', 'look', 'out', 'nobody', 'perfect', 'Even', 'enemies', 'have', 'shade', 'moral', 'greyness.And', 'course', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'usual', 'flair', 'story', 'butt-kicking', 'action', 'scenes', 'grotesque', 'horror', 'hint', 'conspiracy', 'bucketloads', 'quotable', 'dialogue', '34', 'Yeah', 'should', 'start', 'dealing', 'black-market', 'beagles', '34', 'rough', ""n'ready"", 'Wild', 'West', 'lingo', 'hilarious', '34', 'Baby', 'geese', 'Goslings', 'were', 'juggled', '34', '.The', 'characters', 'are', 'motley', 'family', 'sorts', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'agree', 'even', 'necessarily', 'other', 'are', 'mostly', 'unified', 'colorful', 'different', 'jobs', 'ritualized', 'sex', 'worker', 'ex-soldiers', 'merc', 'doctor', 'priest', 'allow', 'have', 'even', 'more', 'varied', 'backstories', 'actors', 'do', 'excellent', 'jobs', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Morena', 'Baccarin', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'Sean', 'Maher', 'all', 'give', 'particularly', 'good', 'performances', 'most', 'exceptional', 'Glau', 'River', 'damaged', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'mad', 'things', 'cows', 'wears', 'pretty', 'floaty', 'dresses.', '34', 'Firefly', 'Complete', 'Series', '34', 'slice', 'rich', 'witty', 'sci-fi', 'sadly', 'had', 'only', 'brief', 'moment', 'sun', 'fairer', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'years', 'tedious', 'reality', 'shows', 'crashed', 'burned']",N/A

I have also, since purchasing this set re-watched it three of four times, only proving the great re-watch value this set has.Great moments includes Richard Brook's bounty hunter who is menacing as well as has a hearing problem, captain Mal's sudden wife who puts the ship in danger, the sword duel between mal and lor atherton, and so many other great situations.I have forced many of my friends to buy this, and after watching it, they have always thanked me.",5,without a doubt TV's finest hour,1129248000,"10 14, 2005",2005,1603,"['was', 'never', 'able', 'catch', 'firefly', 'was', 'television', 'look', 'back', 'how', 'horribly', 'marketed', 'series', 'was', 'television', 'run', 'realise', 'i', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'catch', 'was', 'however', 'intrigued', 'when', 'got', 'dvd', 'release', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'having', 'been', 'told', 'was', 'worth', 'check', 'i', 'gambled', 'bought', 'set', 'possibly', 'most', 'treasured', 'DVD', 'now', 'top', '5', 'must', 'have', 'DVDs.Once', 'put', 'first', 'episode', 'watch', 'will', 'be', 'enticed', 'sit', 'watch', 'four', 'discs', 'character', 'created', 'series', 'so', 'well', 'chemistry-wise', 'make', 'such', 'remarcable', 'world', 'together', 'best', 'special', 'effects', 'incredible', 'writting', 'highest', 'production', 'value', 'i', 'have', 'seen', 'television', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'culminates', 'apex', 'television', 'series.Some', 'most', 'quotable', 'lines', 'will', 'hear', 'loud', 'moments', 'incredible', 'surprises', 'captain', 'Mal', 'crew', 'firefights', 'sword', 'duels', 'russian', 'mobsters', 'space', 'crazed', 'space', 'canibals', 'many', 'other', 'surprises', 'will', 'keep', 'characters', 'memory', 'long', 'while', 'watched', 'have', 'also', 'purchasing', 'set', 're-watched', 'three', 'four', 'times', 'only', 'proving', 'great', 're-watch', 'value', 'set', 'has.Great', 'moments', 'Richard', 'Brook', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'who', 'menacing', 'as', 'well', 'hearing', 'problem', 'captain', 'Mal', 'sudden', 'wife', 'who', 'ship', 'danger', 'sword', 'duel', 'mal', 'lor', 'atherton', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'great', 'situations.I', 'have', 'forced', 'many', 'friends', 'buy', 'watching', 'have', 'always', 'thanked']",N/A

Buffy is the valley girl as world savior.  Firefly is the Wild West in Space.  Others have done this Wild West in space thing before but never this explicitly.  I am still on the fence about the soundtrack which still clashes no matter how much I see it.  Whedon's most daring dramatic exploit as well as his trademark is to combine extreme emotional situations with sarcastic skewering comedy, shown most ingeniously with the fake death in the Pilot episode.  His filmmaking pedigree has always been surprisingly avant-garde for television.  His directing on all of his series is singular.  Here he is incorporating jump cuts, fractured scene structures, and overall a more somber mood.  The hand-held CGI was jacked by Battlestar Galactica.  (A good show in its own right, but far more serious and heavy-handed)  All said, Whedon's guidance is impressive, and just adds to the anticipation for the Firefly movie where he has hopefully the budget and power to do what he wishes to do.  I still don't get why Firefly was cancelled, this is the network that lets lowbrow base entertainment like Joe Millionaire co-exist with intelligent well-written dramas and comedies like 24 and Arrested Development.  Firefly definitely had cult show written all over it, but so did X-Files and that lasted for 9 years and made Fox untold millions.  But they had to have some regrets otherwise they wouldn't have greenlit the movie.

On the positive side, this gives Serenity a hard edge with a nuanced sense of morality. The characters live in a moral grey zone and the show never forces use to draw sharp black or white lines around the crew. Each individual makes his or her own decisions and none are perfect. Some of their actions might shock modern viewers, but the show also does remind viewers that life in the fringes is hard. This is a recipe for rich character development.However, Firefly carries the Western motif a bit too far. It's not just a mix between Western and sci-fi genres, but actually a Western that takes place in space. The show reeks of being a Western, from the 19th century-style firearms, clothes, frequent shootouts, and even banjo theme music. If not for the spaceship, viewers could be forgiven for forgetting that the show takes place in 2517, not 1817. At times the heavy-handedness undermined the show's attempts at world-building, making the entire show less believable and less engrossing.Overall, Firefly is definitely worth a try for sci-fi fans - IF the idea of a Space Western sounds appealing. However, it certainly doesn't reach the greatness of Star Trek or even Battlestar Galactica for world-building and interesting plots.",4,Western sci-fi,1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,1491,"['was', 'excited', 'see', 'Firefly', 'given', 'overwhelmingly', 'positive', 'reviews', 'show', '14', 'episodes', 'later', 'can', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'buy', 'hype.Firefly', 'unabashedly', 'Western', 'space', 'weakness', 'strength', 'positive', 'side', 'Serenity', 'hard', 'edge', 'nuanced', 'sense', 'morality', 'characters', 'live', 'moral', 'grey', 'zone', 'show', 'never', 'forces', 'use', 'draw', 'sharp', 'black', 'white', 'lines', 'crew', 'individual', 'own', 'decisions', 'none', 'are', 'perfect', 'actions', 'might', 'shock', 'modern', 'viewers', 'show', 'also', 'remind', 'viewers', 'life', 'fringes', 'hard', 'recipe', 'rich', 'character', 'development.However', 'Firefly', 'Western', 'motif', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'not', 'just', 'mix', 'Western', 'sci-fi', 'genres', 'actually', 'Western', 'place', 'space', 'show', 'reeks', 'being', 'Western', '19th', 'century-style', 'firearms', 'clothes', 'frequent', 'shootouts', 'even', 'banjo', 'theme', 'music', 'not', 'spaceship', 'viewers', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'forgetting', 'show', 'place', '2517', 'not', '1817', 'times', 'heavy-handedness', 'undermined', 'show', 'attempts', 'world-building', 'making', 'entire', 'show', 'less', 'believable', 'less', 'engrossing.Overall', 'Firefly', 'definitely', 'worth', 'try', 'sci-fi', 'fans', 'idea', 'Space', 'Western', 'appealing', 'However', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'reach', 'greatness', 'Star', 'Trek', 'even', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'world-building', 'interesting', 'plots']",N/A

But since it was Joss Whedon's work, I knew I had to give it a chance.  He proved me wrong about Buffy, and I was hoping he'd do the same with Firefly.As it turns out, Firefly surpassed all my hopes and expectations.  It's quality television at its best.  The characters are fleshed out, the story's well thought out, and everything comes together wonderfully.  The characters start off as strangers but warm up to you, and each proves to be individual, yet endearing in their own way, and you begin to sympathize and care for the crew of Firefly.Whedon takes his time to flesh out his characters at a pace that's neither too rushed nor too laxed- it's just right, perfectly comfortable.  The character of River, for instance, starts off a complete looney, simpering, and frail, and by the end, you just love her to bits, and you start realizing she's not the most vulnerable one on the crew.  Perhaps she's even the strongest!Each actor plays his/her part as if they were born to play it, especially the Nathan Fillion (Mal), Morena Baccarin (Inara), and Summer Glau (River).Whedon's genius is his ability to make anything about the characters and keep it human.  Too many shows get carried away by their own genre.  Too many people make sci-fi shows just for the sake of having a sci-fi show.  For example, how many times have you seen a show with ho-hum characters and storylines, but boasted an interesting concept?  The characters seem like just vehicles to carry out the story of their environment.  Then there are the dramas that are about nothing except characters and their relationships, and you wish more external circumstances (reality) could be taken into consideration.  Joss Whedon strikes the perfect balance between the two, and Firefly boasts a fascinating, intelligent concept, while maintaining characters that are fleshed out, lively, personable, charismatic, and *live* the story rather than just play it out.If you saw it on TV and it confused you, it's probably because Fox showed the episodes out of order.  A few people have said that they loved Firefly after watching the DVDs, since Whedon arranged the episodes to show in the order it was intended to be aired in.This is one of the best shows I've seen in a while, by far.

The episodes, while some have been done before on other Sci-fi series, are exciting and still fun to watch. And the ship ""Serenity"" herself is quite a ship.The thing that impresses most about this series is how realistic the show seems. It's set 500 years and the future, and instead of phasers like on Trek, they are still using basic guns like we have now. Another thing that is realistic is how the scenes in space are quiet since no sound is in outer space. Overall, this is a great series. I'm a Trekkie and I love this series.

Underlying the entire show is a very original and interesting mix of a futuristic world with the familiar elements of the ""wild west"".  There's one scene with a gang of henchmen riding through the desert on horseback  while the rich man rides on a slick hovercraft!The only drawback of this show is the fact that it's incomplete due to the fact that it was cancelled mid-season!  Such a shame, because there's so much potential for it to blossom into a REALLY GOOD SHOW!  So much was left unanswered.  Why is River wanted so badly by the authorities?

I knew I was going to love it when the Pilot episode opened with Wash (the ship's pilot) playing with plastic dinosaurs while waiting for the crew to finish a 'heist.' The movie 'Serenity' extends the story and fills in some of the past.The effects are well done (it's not Lord of the Rings, but they're good). There is great action. But it's the cast and their relationships that make this movie (and series) so special. It's not that the acting is Oscar quality per se; it's that the characters are so real. This is in contrast to the last three Star Wars films where the acting is so stilted and wooden, you don't care who gets killed or about anything else for that matter (note that I loved the original trilogy for the same reason as Firefly/Serenity..the way the cast chemistry worked). Humor, anger, angst, sadness...all of them ring true in the way they play off each other.Mal (the captain) is perfect as the ex-soldier who cares for his crew, but tolerates no challenge to his authority (but has a good sense of humor). Ron Glass does a great job as Shepard Book, it's hard not to like Kaylee the engineer and my favorite, tough guy Jayne (Alec Baldwin) who is by far the funniest character (""Uhhhh, I been workin' on a new plan. What say we shoot her first."").At the end of the day, that's what made this series so special. The characters are genuine and easy to care about. There is just that chemistry that's present in any good series/film between the cast. Every episode provided good action and comic relief. If I had to use one word to decribe the series/film, it would be ""fun."" I have every episode on my Ipod (as well as Serenity) and I watch them every time I travel for business (which is fairly often).I own over 600 DVDs and am a pretty serious movie buff. I would rate Firefly/Serenity in the top 20 because it's just such a good ride.

Then recently while on a vacation I bought the complete ""Firefly"" series on DVD and just loved it! ""Firefly"" is exactly what you want in a sci-fi drama. Wonderfully acted, incredibly believable visually, and a very good story.Again it is a shame that the FOX network more than any other gets it right when choosing series, and then gets it so, so wrong when it comes to cancelling series. And in some cases about marketing DVD's, but I digress.If you enjoy sci-fi even a little bit, you should find ""Firefly"" a worthy investment of your time and money.

I didn't think I could go wrong with Joss, despite it being cancelled in the US (and never having seen the screened episodes, being from Australia), and I was right. From the beginning, the production values and acting talent are of the highest quality.  However I almost dropped the rating back to 4 stars, because of a few relatively &quot;slow&quot; episodes where characters were being established, or too much time was spent on &quot;guns and horses&quot;, or where an episode's plot seemed too derivative of other old tv and movie cliches.  But then I realised I was being unduly harsh, judging Firefly against the impossibly high standards of Buffy.  Firefly fails to be as &quot;funny&quot; as Buffy often was, but gains ground for some of its audience by being more adult and much more morally ambiguous. On any objective measure, this show is easily in the top 10% and therefore a worthy &quot;5 stars&quot;.  I suspect the critics of this show didn't bother to see past a few of those cliches to perceive the strength of early character development and overall story arcs being established.  The seeds of several such arcs are clear and bulging with potential and it is frustrating to think that we may never see the fuller realisation of those ideas.

766221,AJXP2ONZ1AB9D,B0000AQS0F,Grant Reed,"[0, 0]","As I understand it the original name of Star Trek was Wagon Train to the Stars. It was envisioned, and even pitched, as a western set in space. Joss Whedon's Firefly does a better job of that.It is the future, Humanity has expanded to the stars as we exhausted the resources of our own planet. There is a central government for the various planets, but not all planets benefit equally from this. The Central planets are very well policed and run, as well as rich. The outer planets are not as fortunate. In most ways they resemble a dificult place to live, and normally have strong thematic elements based around the western United States during its colonization phase.Enter Captain Malcom Reynolds and his ship the Serenity, a firefly class cargo vessel. His crew consists of Zoe, his first mate, her husband, Wash, the pilot, Kaylee his engineer, and of course Jayne, his well enforcer. As the series begin they take on passengers, some which become crew, and others that are passengers for the long haul.Nathan Fillion gains first billing, but Firefly is truly an ensemble cast. Each character, though fitting into a western stereotype, is given a chance to develop. Some of the cast are mysterious, some are almost predictable, but overall the chemistry was truly remarkable.This is a series that can be enjoyed in a number of ways; by following the characters, or following the developments, or just by sitting back and allowing yourself a chance to drift into a different world. It is not a flashy Sci-Fi series with lots of effects. This is Science Fiction, a great tale about people that just happens to occur against the backdrop of our future, a future with both progress and failure. One other thing, there is not the plethora of races in this world, only humans.This is one of the most enjoyable series I have ever watched. I recommend it to everyone, but especially to those who like good Science Fiction, or those that miss westerns.I would have preferred to give it 4 1/2 stars, as there are a number of questions that remain unanswered, but as we cannot rate on half points, I am more than happy to round this series, a true gem, up to a five.",5,Excellent Science Fiction series.,1087430400,"06 17, 2004",2004,2159,"['understand', 'original', 'name', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'Stars', 'was', 'envisioned', 'even', 'pitched', 'western', 'set', 'space', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Firefly', 'better', 'job', 'that.It', 'future', 'Humanity', 'expanded', 'stars', 'exhausted', 'resources', 'own', 'planet', 'central', 'government', 'various', 'planets', 'not', 'planets', 'benefit', 'equally', 'Central', 'planets', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'policed', 'run', 'as', 'well', 'rich', 'outer', 'planets', 'are', 'not', 'fortunate', 'most', 'ways', 'resemble', 'dificult', 'place', 'live', 'normally', 'have', 'strong', 'thematic', 'elements', 'based', 'western', 'United', 'States', 'colonization', 'phase.Enter', 'Captain', 'Malcom', 'Reynolds', 'ship', 'Serenity', 'firefly', 'class', 'cargo', 'vessel', 'crew', 'Zoe', 'first', 'mate', 'husband', 'Wash', 'pilot', 'Kaylee', 'engineer', 'course', 'Jayne', 'well', 'enforcer', 'series', 'begin', 'take', 'passengers', 'become', 'crew', 'others', 'are', 'passengers', 'long', 'haul.Nathan', 'Fillion', 'gains', 'first', 'billing', 'Firefly', 'truly', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'character', 'fitting', 'western', 'stereotype', 'given', 'chance', 'develop', 'cast', 'are', 'mysterious', 'are', 'almost', 'predictable', 'chemistry', 'was', 'truly', 'remarkable.This', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'number', 'ways', 'following', 'characters', 'following', 'developments', 'just', 'sitting', 'back', 'allowing', 'chance', 'drift', 'different', 'world', 'not', 'flashy', 'Sci-Fi', 'series', 'lots', 'effects', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'great', 'tale', 'people', 'just', 'occur', 'backdrop', 'future', 'future', 'progress', 'failure', 'One', 'other', 'thing', 'not', 'plethora', 'races', 'world', 'only', 'humans.This', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'especially', 'who', 'like', 'good', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'miss', 'westerns.I', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'give', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'are', 'number', 'questions', 'remain', 'unanswered', 'can', 'not', 'rate', 'half', 'points', 'am', 'more', 'happy', 'round', 'series', 'true', 'gem', 'up', 'five']",N/A

766227,AKT0Y6J9AK469,B0000AQS0F,"GumbyTheCat ""Gumby""","[9, 10]","The Fox Network, it seems, has a history of being quick on the draw when it comes to pronouncing judgment on their offerings. Sometimes that is a good thing; Fox has canceled many a ludicrous and mind-numbingly inane series. However, sometimes they have canceled series with much promise.Never has Fox messed up so badly as when they canceled ""Firefly"". They took a cursory look at the ratings (98th in the Nielsen ratings, with about 4.7 million viewers per episode), and tossed this wonderful series in the trash can. They never even gave it much of a chance, having only aired 11 of the 14 of the finished episodes - and aired them out of order, with the pilot ""Serenity"" being aired later than other episodes. In short, Fox just seemed totally uninterested in supporting this series from the start.I am not a big fan of television anymore; as a matter of fact I canceled my cable service months ago because programming is just so bad these days. However, I do have Netflix, which allows me to stream quality shows I want to see. I had never even heard of the series, but after seeing gushing praise for Firefly on the Pharyngula blog, I dialed it up on Netflix. And oh, boy, did I ever get a treat.I've been a fan of written and visual science fiction for 4 decades, and as such have experienced it from many angles, both good and not-so-good. With Firefly, I saw sci-fi in a way I had never seen it before. I had of course heard of the term ""space western"", and have seen elements of that concept in shows like Star Trek and in movies like Star Wars and Avatar. However, until now I had never seen the ""space western"" theme realized in such a literal way. The juxtaposition between spaceships and horses, and space stations and frontier towns, is a delight to watch. The storylines are sometimes straight out of westerns, such as the train heist in ""The Train Job"". Josh Whedon, however, flawlessly interweaves the two seemingly at-odds thematic elements, and the result is 14 phenomenal episodes (and a great followup theatrical release, ""Serenity""). There is an equal mix of drama, humor and action in this series, and just when you think you know what direction an episode is going to take, Whedon takes it in a totally different direction. Rarely is television so well-scripted, especially these days.Interesting concept aside, no television show is worth much if the characters are not believable or interesting. Firefly has great character development. All the main characters are (through both scripting and acting) fully fleshed-out human beings who we grow to deeply care about as we progress through the series. You can tell that the actors really cared about their roles, because their performances effortlessly exude the characters as they were conceived by Whedon. Through these portrayals come the series' great strength - a tale of desperate people of disparate backgrounds who find themselves linked in a particular place and time. We see the love and anger, the humor and sadness, and we identify with them. We want to be with them on Serenity, living the lives that they lead.All in all, I think that the Fox network executive who made the decision to dump this series should be hog-tied and deposited on the deck of a ship full of starving, amorous Reavers. Television is almost never this good, and if Firefly had been allowed to run its originally-planned 7 full seasons, I believe it would be referred to by the general TV-viewing public as one of the all-time great series.Even if you're not a fan of sci-fi, get this anyway.

Everyone was talking about how great it was, so I had to get the set and see for myself. Boy was I impressed! I was totally blown away! I can't wait for the movie 'Serenity' to hit the theaters this coming September (knock on wood they don't change the date AGAIN--it was originally going to come out in April, but they didn't want Serenity to get lost in the shadow of the new Star Wars movie, which is totally understandable considering how few people have heard about this awesome show)!!I moved to WA state 9 years ago after living in Tucson, AZ for 25 years. Every time I watch one of the Firefly episodes, I feel like I'm there again, and don't want the show to end. It's not only because I miss living there so much, but because the characters are so believable, and the show itself is extremely ingenious, incorporating the old west into a sci-fi environment. I like Star Trek, the X-Files, Dark Angel, and Tru Calling (can't forget Wonderfalls, either!), but Firefly actually tops my list for science fiction favorite, by being so innovative.

Supposedly they had decided after they'd signed on with the show for the 1st season that they didn't think it would be very popular and therefor were going to cancel it after the first season...and then for whatever reason, they decided to just show it in any random order.  It did, in fact, become pretty popular despite this so Fox made a big mistake in doing this...there are so many people out there who would have loved to see this show continue.  But of course, Fox is notorious for fouling things up...makes me sick.  At least Joss was able to tie it off in the movie Serenity.Anyway, it's not often I buy TV on DVD/Blu-Ray...normally I'll just rewatch shows on Netflix or something.  However, I did really love this show, and I had Serenity on Blu-Ray, so I finally just decided to pick this up on Blu-Ray to go with it.  Totally worth while show...it's an interesting blending of Sci-Fi and Western.  The characters are all cool in their own ways...I think my favorite is probably Ms. Kaylee Frey!  She's like my Hollywood dream girl...she's so lovable and funny.  The whole cast adds some great character to the whole show all around though.While it's sad that the show was cut so short, the little bit there is of it is memorable and entertaining, and worth watching more than once...which is why it was worth it to me to buy the set and the follow up movie, Serenity.

It includes the eleven episodes originally aired on the Fox television network plus three unaired shows, commentary on fully half the episodes, and a large assortment of extras.  As a courtesy to the TV fans of ""Firefly"" this review contains NO SPOILERS.""Firefly"" was often described as a ""space western"".  Set 500 years in the future, when a large number of planets and moons have been terraformed, many frontier planets are subsisting with little more than basic 19th-century tools: horses, wagons, cattle, lever-action rifles, and the like.  But this is the future when America and China were the clear winners of the race for cultural dominance so every backwater yokel can curse in Chinese as well as twangy American idiom, and newspapers have moving text.Malcolm Reynolds (played by Nathan Fillion) and Zoe Warren (Gina Torres) are survivors (on the losing side) of the war to unite all the planets.  To gain some freedom from the encroaching forces of the victorious Alliance, they purchase an old transport ship of the Firefly class.  Named ""Serenity"" for the battle of Serenity Valley, where they lost the war, the ship's crew was fleshed out with pilot Wash Warren (Zoe's husband, played by Alan Tudyk), mechanic Kaylee Frye (Jewel Staite), and muscle Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin).  They later pick up some passengers: companion (futuristic geisha) Inara Serra (Morena Baccarin), doctor Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and his troubled genius sister River (Summer Glau), and Shepherd (preacher) Book (Ron Glass).I'll leave the show summary there (NO SPOILERS, remember) but just point out that one of the hallmarks of Joss Whedon shows is how people who aren't related become family.  In its short run ""Firefly"" was a shiny example of family-building.  Now on to the DVD collection.The DVD set consists of 4 discs, each in individual plastic holders, and an outer cardboard sleeve.  The only difference in the packaging is a different cast member portrait for each plastic box; each disc is pressed with the same image of the ""Firefly"" title.  There are no extra materials in the packaging.  Here's a breakdown of the contents of each disc.DISC ONE: (picture of Nathan Fillion, ""Malcolm Reynolds"")1.

""Objects in Space""Commentary by executive producer Joss WhedonSpecial Features:- Here's How It Was: The Making of Firefly- Deleted Scenes- Serenity: The 10th Character- Alan Tudyk's Audition- Gag Reel- Joss Tours the Ship- Joss Sings the Firefly ThemeThe episodes originally aired on the Fox television network starting with #2, ""The Train Job"", and continued in order through episode #9, ""War Stories"".  Then came #14, ""Objects in Space"", and (after the series had been cancelled) finally the pilot.  Fox has a long history of starting science fiction shows (usually on Friday evenings) but giving them only a short run before yanking them off the air.  Skipping the pilot of ""Firefly"" didn't help the show gain a following.  (Remember ""Werewolf"", ""Alien Nation"", ""The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr."", ""M.A.N.T.I.S."", ""VR.5"", ""Strange Luck"", ""Space: Above and Beyond"", ""Kindred: The Embraced"", ""Brimstone"", ""Harsh Realm"", ""Freaky Links"", ""Dark Angel"", or ""The Lone Gunmen""?  All of these were Fox shows; most of them were cancelled shortly after their debut.)  The DVD collection restores the shows to their proper order.For a short-lived series, ""Firefly"" had a respectable assortment of guest stars.  Recurring villains include Mark A. Sheppard as ""Badger"", Michael Fairman as ""Niska"", and Christina Hendricks as ""Saffron""/""Bridget""/""Yolanda""/whoever.  More notable one-shot guests include Edward Atterton, Richard Brooks, Richard Burgi, Melinda Clarke, William Converse-Roberts, Larry Drake, Gregg Henry, Isabella Hofmann, and Carlos Jacott.  Viewers of Joss Whedon's other shows will spot several familiar faces.""Firefly - The Complete Series"" is a 5-star entertainment package, with plenty of additonal material for fans of the series.  The actual production of the 4-DVD set is disappointing in several ways, though.  Pioneer Disc Manufacturing Corporation (PDMC) did their usual annoying job of arranging the DVD menus using a number of phantom ""titles"" that cause slow, repeated disc seeks for each menu selection.  They've also buried the many disc commentary selections three levels deep under ""Language Selection"".  On the positive side all the chapter stops are placed properly, and the video and audio transfer are both good.""Here's How It Was: The Making of Firefly"" includes commentary by all nine of the cast.  Gina Torres appears in costume, speaking of her character in the present tense; all the others came back after cancellation to add their remembrances of the show.  Also in this retrospective are Joss Whedon, Tim Minear, Jane Espenson, producer Gareth Davies, Chris Buchanan (President of Mutant Enemy), Chinese translator Jenny Lynn, Kelly Wheeler (assistant to the producer), camera operator Allen Easton, visual effects supervisor Loni Peristere, associate producer Lisa Lassek, and composer Greg Edmonson.The fact that they could get nine different people to come back to provide audio commentary for the DVD collection, and as many more for the retrospective of the series, is a strong indication of the commitment these people have for ""Firefly"".

Ross ""biblemonkey""","[0, 0]","Let's be honest; for a long time after the show was canceled ""Firefly"" fans could be some of the most obnoxious and pushy fans out there. Constantly flooding every discussion site with ""Firefly"" based arguments and discussions regardless of how out of place they were. This was the main reason that some (like me) avoided the show for a VERY long time.I wasn't a Joss Whedon fan until earlier this year. I hated ""Buffy"" and all the spin-offs and so didn't care about him as a director and creator. Then I saw ""The Avengers"" and received a great intro to what he could do with the right material. Some friends begged me to Watch ""Firefly"" that weekend and I relented and watched the pilot...then I went out the next day and bought the whole series and the movie ""Serenity""!Oh my goodness! The acting! The attention to detail! The writing! I genuinely cared what was going to happen next! I hadn't felt that excited about a show in a long time. The actors are all wonderful in their roles and sometimes you forget that they are acting. They just seem so right. The show took clich&eacute;s of right and wrong and ""heroes"" and turned them on their heads. The stories were both compelling on their own and yet fit into a longer story arc. Whatever was going through the heads of the executives that doomed this show, I will never know. I know that Whedon's constant fear of being canceled led him to focus on making every episode as concise and appealing as possible while being true to his original vision and that very well may have led to better episodes than we would have gotten otherwise, but there is not one bad or out of place episode in the series.If you like good sci-fi with quality everything, this is the show for you.",5,Late Comer and now a True Fan,1354147200,"11 29, 2012",2012,1728,"['Let', 'be', 'honest', 'long', 'time', 'show', 'was', 'canceled', 'Firefly', 'fans', 'could', 'be', 'most', 'obnoxious', 'pushy', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'Constantly', 'flooding', 'discussion', 'site', 'Firefly', 'based', 'arguments', 'discussions', 'regardless', 'how', 'place', 'were', 'was', 'main', 'reason', 'avoided', 'show', 'VERY', 'long', 'time.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'fan', 'earlier', 'year', 'hated', 'Buffy', 'spin-offs', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'about', 'director', 'creator', 'Then', 'saw', 'Avengers', 'received', 'great', 'intro', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'right', 'material', 'friends', 'begged', 'Watch', 'Firefly', 'weekend', 'relented', 'watched', 'pilot', 'then', 'went', 'next', 'day', 'bought', 'whole', 'series', 'movie', 'Serenity', 'Oh', 'goodness', 'acting', 'attention', 'detail', 'writing', 'genuinely', 'cared', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'had', ""n't"", 'felt', 'excited', 'show', 'long', 'time', 'actors', 'are', 'wonderful', 'roles', 'sometimes', 'forget', 'are', 'acting', 'just', 'seem', 'so', 'right', 'show', 'took', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'right', 'wrong', 'heroes', 'turned', 'heads', 'stories', 'were', 'compelling', 'own', 'yet', 'fit', 'longer', 'story', 'arc', 'was', 'going', 'heads', 'executives', 'doomed', 'show', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'know', 'Whedon', 'constant', 'fear', 'being', 'canceled', 'led', 'focus', 'making', 'episode', 'concise', 'appealing', 'possible', 'being', 'true', 'original', 'vision', 'very', 'well', 'may', 'have', 'led', 'better', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'otherwise', 'not', 'one', 'bad', 'place', 'episode', 'series.If', 'good', 'sci-fi', 'quality', 'everything', 'show']",N/A
766252,A1VE7UAKRR9KHQ,B0000AQS0F,"H. Stonehouse ""Yemanya""","[2, 2]","One of the biggest travesties in television history was when in their infinite wisdom, the Fox network decided to cancel 'Firefly'.  I, as I am sure is the case with many fans of original, interesting programmes (especially sci-fi) have a list a mile long of shows, that I grew to love, only to find them axed, far too soon, by TV execs who seem to think their viewing public wish it so. Clearly this is not the case however, otherwise there would not be so many reviews complaining about such decisions.  Out of all these shows, nothing disappointed me more than to see 'Firefly' cancelled, and I'll tell you why. Because it had so much potential, yet it never stood a chance.  I could go on to rant about how it was badly scheduled over in America but I'm sure everyone who is reading this write up knows about that so I'll start with the positives,that is to say, what do I love about 'Firefly'?Firstly, its an unlikely mixture: Cowboys, in space, that lapse into mandarin (especially when swearing, those censors never knew what hit 'em) but it works!  That's because of the very excellent Joss Whedon. His scripts brought warmth and depth to the characters as well as the subtle blend of action and humour,  which we have grown to know and love, see also 'Buffy' and 'Angel' for further reference to his writing abilities.  What Whedon does best is flesh out his leading protagonists so that they are actual people, with quirks and habits, not all of them good, but all of them things that we can relate to as human beings, so that they are more real.  It doesn't matter whether they are in a firefly class cargo vessel, or fighting vampires at some high school, Joss's people are simply that, people. They have heartaches and times in between the adventures that are just like you or I, where they sit and talk and laugh and cry.In the case of 'Firefly' its things like, rivalry in the crew, romantic entanglements (and sometimes the lack there of) and basically trying to survive out there in 'the black' far from what is considered to be civilisation.  They are little people living big lives on the edge, despite the inevitable interferance of the alliance (a vast governmental agency that often gets in the way, as governments have a tendency of doing).Another reason to watch, personally speaking is the rather lovely, Mr Nathan Fillion.  I have been a fan of his work for some time and he does wear those unbelievably, tight trousers (what can I say I'm only human), hence Kaylee's nickname of 'Cpt'n Tight Pants' (see Shindig).  Before I lose all credibility can I just say, he is also a talented actor who helps gel the cast together as indeed the crew in his capacity as Cpt. Malcolm Reynolds.  And what a crew, every character has their own specific traits that make them appealing, even Jayne (well maybe appealing isn't quite the right word in his particular case).  It's also worth mentioning that there is an actual married couple on board. They have arguements at times as couples often do but basically they are completely devoted to one another. If anything was set to sway me on the marriage vote it would be Wash and Zoe. They are solid and look set to remain so, barring any unforseen circumstances. I've seen 'Serenity' so I refuse to say more on that subject...sigh.Finally onto the feature film.  I was so glad to see that after such relentless campaigning, loyal 'browncoats' were able to get 'Serenity' another outing, hopefully not for the last time.  Though another series of 'Firefly' seems like nothing but a beautiful dream, lets hope movie execs will have seen the awesome response to the dvd release both in America and over here in England, and also the impact of the movie and give a much loved little show more time on the big screen.  Here's hoping.  In the mean time as the lyrics say so clearly 'You can't take the sky from me.'",5,Fox can't take the sky from me!

766258,A1YRV8ICHSL41F,B0000AQS0F,"Inchoatus.com ""Inchoatus.com""","[13, 16]","Firefly is a very unique offering because it has two conflicting poles of orientation one of which is done very, very well and the other which is haphazard at best. Or, if you will, the Force of Firefly is divided in to the regular Force and the Dark Side of the Force.The Dark Side of the show and the dirty little secret of the series is that the plot itself--and even the setting--was not very compelling. The episodes were very, very pedestrian if you boiled them down and stripped away the actors. A fugitive running from The Law stowing away on a ship? Who hasn't seen this before. A robbery (set on a train)? Seen it. Defend a house (of ill-repute) from villains? Saw it every week on The A-Team when I was a kid. A duel with an effete snob of a villain who desperately overmatches the hero in swordplay? Saw that in Rob Roy of all places... not to mention others. The gunfights are not particularly compelling nor are the fistfights. They occur, they're done moderately well, but they're hardly the groundbreaking action we learned from stalwarts like The Terminator and The Matrix. This is probably what the network suits saw (unlikely they bothered to watch the series). And they weren't wrong about this.But mother of all the gods did they miss the boat on what was so good about the show.On the Good Side of the Force is the characterization. The show is 100% driven by character. No one is watching these shows for the plot. No one is moved by events--rather, it is the characters in the events. People are watching to learn and understand more about Mal and Jayne and the Shepherd and most certainly River. Not to mention the others. The acting, in almost all cases, was superb and well-timed. They are all genuinely interesting. They live with you in ways that are important to all great works of art... they come to embody ideas and feelings that we all share. Like the series' title song, they get under your skin (in the words of one of the actors) and live with you. This is an exceptional compliment to Joss Whedon and the other writers not to mention the actors. Beyond doubt, the superb actors had the requisite sincerity to sell the audience on the work, which is desperately essential in any series like this. We watched the series because of the people. We don't remember the episodes, only what the characters said and did in the episodes.In fact, Firefly shares the most similarities with The Highlander television series. Like Firefly, Highlander seldom had anything interesting going in the way of plot. Every episode ended the same: swordfight with the bad guy, head cut off. Every episode!! It was the most stunning example of pleasantly enjoying the expected (this line from an elegy regarding Johnny Carson--don't remember who said it and would appreciate it if someone could tell us) the world has ever known. Yet Highlander was successful because the audience didn't care about the swordfights. They cared about Duncan. They cared about the Watchers. They cared about the motivations of these people and the things that they were doing.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM",4,A very Good and Unusual Show,1107993600,"02 10, 2005",2005,3110,"['Firefly', 'very', 'unique', 'offering', 'two', 'conflicting', 'poles', 'orientation', 'one', 'done', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'other', 'haphazard', 'best', 'will', 'Force', 'Firefly', 'divided', 'regular', 'Force', 'Dark', 'Side', 'Force.The', 'Dark', 'Side', 'show', 'dirty', 'little', 'secret', 'series', 'plot', 'even', 'setting', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'compelling', 'episodes', 'were', 'very', 'very', 'pedestrian', 'boiled', 'down', 'stripped', 'away', 'actors', 'fugitive', 'running', 'Law', 'stowing', 'away', 'ship', 'Who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'robbery', 'set', 'train', 'Seen', 'Defend', 'house', 'ill-repute', 'villains', 'Saw', 'week', 'A-Team', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'duel', 'effete', 'snob', 'villain', 'who', 'desperately', 'hero', 'swordplay', 'Saw', 'Rob', 'Roy', 'places', 'not', 'mention', 'others', 'gunfights', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'compelling', 'are', 'fistfights', 'occur', ""'re"", 'done', 'moderately', 'well', ""'re"", 'hardly', 'groundbreaking', 'action', 'learned', 'stalwarts', 'Terminator', 'Matrix', 'probably', 'what', 'network', 'suits', 'saw', 'unlikely', 'bothered', 'watch', 'series', 'were', ""n't"", 'wrong', 'this.But', 'mother', 'gods', 'did', 'miss', 'boat', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'show.On', 'Good', 'Side', 'Force', 'characterization', 'show', '100', '%', 'driven', 'character', 'one', 'watching', 'shows', 'plot', 'one', 'moved', 'events', 'rather', 'characters', 'events', 'People', 'are', 'watching', 'learn', 'understand', 'more', 'Mal', 'Jayne', 'Shepherd', 'most', 'certainly', 'River', 'Not', 'mention', 'others', 'acting', 'almost', 'cases', 'was', 'superb', 'well-timed', 'are', 'genuinely', 'interesting', 'live', 'ways', 'are', 'important', 'great', 'works', 'art', 'come', 'embody', 'ideas', 'feelings', 'share', 'series', 'title', 'song', 'get', 'skin', 'words', 'one', 'actors', 'live', 'exceptional', 'compliment', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'other', 'writers', 'not', 'mention', 'actors', 'Beyond', 'doubt', 'superb', 'actors', 'had', 'requisite', 'sincerity', 'sell', 'audience', 'work', 'desperately', 'essential', 'series', 'watched', 'series', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'episodes', 'only', 'what', 'characters', 'said', 'did', 'episodes.In', 'fact', 'Firefly', 'shares', 'most', 'similarities', 'Highlander', 'television', 'series', 'Firefly', 'Highlander', 'seldom', 'had', 'anything', 'interesting', 'going', 'way', 'plot', 'episode', 'ended', 'same', 'swordfight', 'bad', 'guy', 'head', 'cut', 'off', 'episode', 'was', 'most', 'stunning', 'example', 'pleasantly', 'enjoying', 'expected', 'line', 'elegy', 'regarding', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'who', 'said', 'would', 'appreciate', 'someone', 'could', 'tell', 'world', 'ever', 'known', 'Highlander', 'was', 'successful', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'swordfights', 'cared', 'Duncan', 'cared', 'Watchers', 'cared', 'motivations', 'people', 'things', 'were', 'doing.READ', 'THE', 'ENTIRE', 'REVIEW', 'AT', 'INCHOATUS.COM']",N/A

766265,A2U5TOHRO4AVF9,B0000AQS0F,Jack,"[14, 97]","Ah, yes, Firefly.  I read many of the critiques before buying this series and was pleased to see so many had rated it with 5 stars, so I bought the entire series. The story moved quickly and there were certainly no &#8220;draggy&#8221; parts at all; it was an entertaining, swashbuckling tale not unlike Robin Hood-style pirates in deep space and the actors did a fair to good job.  As far as the story line, I would rate Firefly with 4.5 stars.HOWEVER&#8230;.As to how they had the characters all outfitted and the soundtrack, I would rate Firefly with  star only.  The Director, Joss Whedon was quoted saying, about the collector's edition of Serenity, on his thoughts of Firefly&#8230;called Firefly &#34;one of the best shows I've ever seen, by a country mile&#8221;.It was? Why? I didn&#8217;t see that. Trust me, dear reader,  there are so very many that are far, far better movies than this one! Sorry, but I certainly have to disagree with Mr. Whedon.  Of course, his comments seem likely, as he IS trying to get us to buy the more expensive collector&#8217;s edition of Firefly which I would not even think of doing.The story line was okay, and the ship &#8220;Serenity&#8221; was okay, but it ends there. The clothing, soundtrack, form of dress, mannerisms and weapons used in the story were CRAPPY and completely unbelievable, to put it mildly. The setting of the story line is supposed to be 500 years into the future from what I read in the synopsis. If this is the case, then what in the world were the writers thinking when they had all the actors armed with antique weapons and mimicking old 1960&#8217;s westerns? &#8230; Zoe, for example, was armed with what appears to be Steve McQueen&#8217;s old weapon, the cut down old .30-30 Winchester from &#8220;Wanted Dead or Alive&#8221;.  Good grief! Other characters were armed with old revolvers, AK-47&#8217;s and old lever-action .30-30 Winchesters! Really! This would be very much like a crew today of a cargo ship on the high seas moving cargo from port to port, wearing the armor of the conquistadors and armed with old black powder matchlock archebuses or crossbows of the 13th century. The weapons used by the characters were those that one might find in a museum in the year 2512. Further, the characters had handguns strapped down low, like the old Hollywood gunfighters, and it looked downright silly.  This, along with the knee-high boots, slickers from &#8220;Once Upon a Time in The West&#8221; and a music soundtrack right out of &#8220;Deliverance&#8221; ruined the entire show turning it into a fantasy an eighth grader writing this for an unwanted English assignment.Come on, people!

766268,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0000AQS0F,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 3]","At first it looks and sounds light and even amateurish, and then you understand it is fully positioned on another level. It is a mixture of several genres within the frame of a science-fiction film entirely contained in , and around, a special spaceship called Serenity, a spaceship that is a firefly, a bug, a burning insect. The first genre is the functional and psychological happenings within a team of nine people who are together for both the best and the worst, in order to transform the worst into the best, or at least the better by being together. The team is limited to nine people, a perfect diabolic and satanic number, and no manipulation like Serenity is the tenth character will take that dimension away. Nine is perfect because you always have at least one who is totally set apart from the regrouping of people into couples or pairs. And in the end you wonder who is the one who is really apart, who is totally odd, alone because of the various and subtle compositions with only one couple that is really defined as such and all the others being transient, multiple, varied, changing, shifting at various levels of possible realization. In a way it is Star Trek revisited but without all the hullaballoo that goes along with the soldiers, the mechanics, the petty personnel of a flagship. The second genre is of course, recurrent and varied too, the western but in many realizations too. Of course we have the very traditional space western or space cowboy film, like in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, seen from the point of view of the driver marooned on the side of the road after having been forced to lend his car. But there is more. We can think of other models: Dead or Alive, Bonanza (even), Mad Max, a vague allusion to Star wars with the Alliance, a lot of Jules Verne, William Gibson and a few others, even at times, though they might not  know it, Ron Hubbard, and the bordello in the desert is so close to some Indian bordello in some Bollywood classic. We do not have John Wayne and the Indians, but we can afford not to have that genocidal side of the western. The next genre is more trendy and modern with some kind of loose and yet very emotional sensual, erotic even, life or imagination. Many allusions, visual or linguistic, and even here and there an allusion to gay people, slack, as they come up like in one episode, though this side of personal life is warded off nicely, and the allusion to crazy, insane and yet envisaged incest was purely rejected from the series and is a supplementary scene, meaning, a censored one, even if self-censored. We could go on for ever with that game. But what is important is that the film or the series is highly original in the end. It is deeply human and humane, deeply attached to justice and fairness, even with someone who trips into treachery for a slight moment, or one episode. At the same time it is ruthless and even maybe cruel by indifference like when bringing the millionaire to the easy lady he had made pregnant and whose child he had tried to steal knowing that he was going to be shot blank on the spot  by the mother, or also when they get rid of the bounty-hunter by just pushing him into space where he is going to die slowly, except of course if he shortens his life himself and commits suicide. The series is also highly imaginative and each episode really has a knack and appeal of its or their own. We enter the episode and we will be released only when the  case is concluded. Each episode is perfectly self-contained, even when what is announced in one episode does not take place in the next one because the announcement is the punch line of the concerned episode and it would unbalance the next episodes if it were made true. So they whirl around with a pirouette, when they bother, or they just forget, or they think of it and discard it to the supplementary scenes. Self-containment is the best quality of each of these episodes. In other words quite a successful series that, it is true, found its magic achievement in that final symbolic metaphoric blending of Serenity and River, of the escaping spaceship and the mentally disarrayed girl.

766272,AZBME7LBPMF7W,B0000AQS0F,"Jakob Ambrose ""Jake""","[17, 98]","Firefly has the same problem that all of Whedon's shows have. It is unfocused and meanders for far too long. You can throw away about eight episodes a season because he does not know where he wants to go with them. He spends too much time fumbling around in the dark looking for a purpose or a plotline to follow and that is what happened with Firefly. The only difference is that he spends more time world building in this one instead of creating a purpose for the season.After seeing all of the episodes, well it does not live up to the hype. The characters are generic Whedon archetypes. It spends too much time with its being cutesy poo dialog, which is not witty or clever. It spends way too much time explaining insignificant details of the universe that will never pay off. I would probably have enjoyed the show, but the diehard Firefly fans ruined any enjoyment I might get out of it. They built this show up to be one of the greatest shows ever made, proclaimed every episode is golden and chided a network for acting like a business.And nd no, I'm not some lone warrior looking to start a fight. I'm just speaking to the truth that a lot of you are in denial about. Firefly failed not because of some correct order nonsense. If the producer had an idea where he was going, the show would have lasted longer. The general science fiction fanbase saw a badly made show that was confusing to follow. They saw a show whose producer did not have the decency to give them a reason to tune in the following week.Before you spout your correct order nonsense, the science fiction audience had an opportunity to see it in the correct order when SciFi aired for the 13 weeks leading up to the Serenity movie premiere. They did not watch it then, nor did they watch when it was on 13 hour marathons. It was the lowest rated show on SciFi. Ridicule it all you want, but this was from back in the day when SciFi still showed quality science fiction, like Galactica and Farscape. If it did poorly back then, what should that tell you about the show.I am sorry if you Whedonites do not like hearing this, but that is reality. If the show was good, then it did not matter the order it was aired. If the show was good, it would be in its 8th or 9th season. If the show was good, it would not need your wishful thinking and vitriolic responses to keep it alive. If the show was good, it would have expanded beyond the Whedonite audience.

Unfortunately it is entirely too fresh, and just plain to0 good for mainstream TV to appreciate.  I can't wait for the movie and can only hope that maybe the movie will inspire the series to be resurrected on sci-fi or some other worthy station!!!  Joss Whedon continually surprises us with his fresh shows that always keep us coming back for more!!!

766288,A274KYR1DZBU0O,B0000AQS0F,jape55,"[4, 9]","After seeing the thousands of great reviews I had to check this out. What I saw was a decent concept and the potential for strong stories and characters that, honestly could easily have been more than they were. One thing that bothered me were the many completely clich&eacute;d bad guys- evil corporate types and of course (welcome back to the '70s), anybody that promotes traditional values.  Also, the basic story lines of each show were extremely predicatable, things you've seen before in many other shows. Several of the main characters were either over the top or felt like they'd been drug out of the old TV Land toy chest, dressed up with new clothes and presented as something new.I know, it's TV, what do you expect? If this would have come out in the 80's it would probably have been a huge hit. But there a few shows out there from it's time and now that make it look pretty cheesy. Battlestar Galactica is a good example.Having said that, the much more realistic view of humanity a few hundred years from now was very refreshing and relatable compared to the utopian fantasy that shows like Star Trek portray. Yes it would be nice if nobody needed money and people were so loving that we all just sought to better our minds. But thousands of years of human history prove that isn't going to happen in another thousand years, much less in 300-500.Even though I complained a lot, this series was good enough for me to want to watch the whole box set.

The characters and stories were all well thought out.  Being a space western, the feel of the show was unique and the special effects were better than anything seen on TV. However, something always seemed a little weird, like the episodes were out of order.  As it turns out, my gut feelings were right.  What can only be called horribly management and scheduling by Fox, episodes were played out of order.  The 2 hour series premiere was not shown first.  Instead another episode started the series on TV, jumping right into the middle of a plot line and characters that the audience didn't know.  Eleven episodes later Fox had done such a poor job promoting this critically acclaimed show that it was cancelled with another 3 episodes left unaired.  These episodes are included, fully produced, on the DVD set.So many Firefly DVD sets have now been sold that Universal Studios has series creator Joss Whedon (Buffy and Angel fame) already filming a Firefly big screen movie called &quot;Serenity&quot; (serenitymovie.com).

766292,A2RNU49OEH8L9W,B0000AQS0F,"Jason S. Taylor ""Marco's Realto""","[3, 3]","Like many I loved Firefly. The setting has long been praised and it is done well enough: though there are better(esp the Traveller RPG verse) there are worse. The absense of FTL can give a feeling of hopelessness though. You know that sooner or later they will take the sky from Mal and his crew. It is the characters that are best though.The disadvantages should be given first. There is considerable inappropriateness including nudity and sexual references. There is a lot of casual violence too but at least it is appropriate to the setting. The advantages of the show far outweigh such things. Fortunately unlike in some shows, such things tend to be concentrated in a few parts so the more straitlaced like this reviewer can filter it fairly easily with a fast-forward without disturbing the plot.The crew of the Serenity are what might be called Space Cossacks. They are people gone into the wild to escape the confines of a large empire like the original Cossacks. They live by smuggling, trade and banditry out on the borders of ""the Alliance"" They go there for various reasons from resentment, like Mal to survival, like the Tams(the Tams are a classic example of noble fugitives, like many a courtier in history who has run afoul of high-class intrigue). Much of the show is a heroic portrayal of Scotch-Irish morality with a strong emphasis on loyalty to the in group. It is also reminder of the need for checks on centralized authority. In a way the show is kind of a reverse of Star Trek being from the perspective of the crew of a lowly tramp ship  instead of members of a large naval bureaucracy.Mal rules like a clan chieftain. He is violent and unafraid to kill(his sin really is wrath) but he treats his crew like men and has a strong protective instinct. Zoe is his sidekick. She unfortunately has a little developed personality but Wash the pilot and her husband likes her a lot. Inara I never took to and thought her rather embarrassing. She is sweet, sensitive and considerate but I would agree with Mal that a professional is a professional even if she gives herself a fancy name. But she is plausible and there have been folk like her in history. Book is an interesting character because not many sci-fis allow religion to come naturally. Jayne I quite disliked. He has many fans but his fans really seem to love him because he is so hyperbolically despicable and repulsive that he seems to many to be lovable. But somehow I find it hard to like someone who was a bully, a traitor, a coward(yes he is despite his display), a blowhard and insults a disturbed girl in front of her and her brother. That is kind of the point though. As for other characters, well who could forget dear little Kaylee, the sweet little Ms fix-it?. She is cheerful, cute, and has a crush on the good Dr Simon who is prim, awkward and most unfortunately very busy, making returning such  things difficult for him and thus leaving the viewer in suspense.My favorite all the characters was River Tam and her brother Dr. Simon Tam. Simon was the best and most complex of all of them. He has an appealing combination of warmth and rationality. He is softspoken, polite(except when being impolite is appropriate)and rather dandyish. But in a way he was the bravest of the crew. He was willing to accept loss of status, exile, and peril because his sister was wronged and there was no one else to right it. He is usually gentle and not a skilled fighter, but he is at times as dangerous and as awe-inspiring as you would expect from someone who has nothing left to lose but honor and a loved one he sacrificed everything for. In times of stress he can remain remarkably calm and he is possessed of a tremendous determination. He can be a self-control freak sometimes and one suspects him of being haunted by irrational guilt. At times his devotion to River approaches sainthood but he has hidden a latent fanaticism which we catch an occasional glimpse of and which seems quite human(the higher one tries to climb the farther to fall). He is most of the time a doting big-brother and cares for her with such skills his profession allows him(an out-of-specialty case but at least he knows HOW to learn on the job). As well as the affection that perhaps she needs even more. But when his sister is threatened he is as fierce as a wolf defending a cub. He comes out as a very noble yet still human character and manages to be good while still being likable.River is a great and sympathetic portrayal of a disturbed person. Mental affliction is a misfortune that one can fear looking at closely. But River humanizes it. She was rendered insane by government experiments and the Alliance thinks her a ""precious commodity"". At times she is a normal girl. And at other times she is very not normal. It is Simon's mission to protect her-and incidently protect others from her. A job bigger then most young men face, even those in the top three percent of med school.The relationship between Simon and River is beautiful and well presented. It lifts the show up into the epic level. The two are inseparable and feel themselves alone in a hostile world. They sometimes provide moments of tears and sometimes provide moments of awe but do so in a homey way that looks believable(River: ""I didn't think you would come for me."" Simon:""Well you're a dummy""). It is more believable still when one realizes that even ""mere"" human love can at times be as spectacular and still look very much like that. Here one can as is sometimes the case learn the beauty of real flowers by seeing fairy flowers.One essay once compared Simon and Mal and this seems at first glance a odd contrast, Simon's city-slicker perfectionism and Mal's ruffianly nature seem an odd fit. They start off as rivals because the interests of those they respectively protect seem to clash. But they slowly learn to respect each other and are alike in their protective instincts, and in their determination.Firefly is a great production. It has been widely praised by people of all kinds and has something for everyone. One can hope that more sci-fis will come that will be as good as Firefly. But there can never be another Firefly.",5,Space Cossacks,1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,6178,"['many', 'loved', 'Firefly', 'setting', 'long', 'been', 'praised', 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'are',

766296,A2PUA6GJJJQKTD,B0000AQS0F,Jay Chen,"[1, 1]","Firefly is definitely a little different than the run of the mill sci-fi series. What makes it different is the cowboy flair they give to it. You wouldn't think that mixing a cowboy style with sci-fi would work, but in this case it does.My favorite character is the lead, Malcom. He's more or less a retired cavalry officer who has taken up a new line of work captaining a ship called Firefly. The character has a ton of charisma. He's not at all one of those wimpy sci-fi characters that's always worried about intergalactic peace or the prime directive. He tends to shoot first an ask questions later.The other characters are interesting too. Malcolm's almost love interest is a high end call girl, who takes occasional jobs as they stop off at various places along the way. And then there is the rather quirky pilot who provides some good moments of comic relief. Toss in a couple of others, and the occasional visitor and it's a pretty interesting crew.The technical name for this type of genre is a ""space opera"". What that means is that the episodes often showcase different aspects of the various characters lives to the backdrop of some kind of drama. Series like Star Trek, Farscape, etc., fall into that same category and if you liked them, you'll likely enjoy Firefly.A great many people wonder why the series ended. And considering what the did with the two season's, tend to agree. Some episodes towards the end did loose their edge, but I didn't think they were out of gas. If the series had any weakness it was probably that they didn't develop aliens that were terribly interesting. The ultra villains, the Reavers, were kind of a joke. However, my guess is that Joss just got bored with it and moved on to some other project.Short as it was, I'd recommend it.

The stories are not &#34;been there done that.&#34; They are told with the love of a true creator. They are carefully woven into eachother to form a vibrant future-esque world where a group of odd compatriots work together to survive and stay safe from a malovelent and oppressive government and the assorted thugs of the galaxy.This Blu-Ray does what apparently the network execs never thought to. It presents the series in the correct story sequence. How Odd that Joss W. wanted his audience to understand why Mal and his first mate hold such contempt for the core planets and their government. You find out how the Tam's come to be on Serenity, any why the Companion puts up with her host. Watching it in full in its intended broadcasting order makes me sad for the director having to put up with moronic studio execs who shattered thes steady build in drama and revelation Joss W. had crafted.I was introduced to firefly through the movie Serenity, and I am now even more amazed at how the arc for the story in that movie had its roots in the opening episode of this series. It is obvious the creators loved their world and took time to craft scenery and dialogue to flesh out these characters and make you forget you are watching a show.The menues for these discs are beautiful and easy to navigate.

I knew it was Joss Whedon, who wrote the script for &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (which I liked) but I never got to liking &quot;Angel&quot; or &quot;Buffy.&quot; So I'd figure it was worth a shot, and boy, was I surprised. We watched the first disc and some of the second disc straight through. I laughed, I sighed, I screamed, I enjoyed. I had never seen anything like this before. When we finished the series, and later watched the special features, I knew I had to buy it.You can read the Amazon review for the plot. It won't take much to adapt to the &quot;Whedonese&quot; or the chinese cursing. What really will get your attention is that there aren't any aliens at all through the run, and the characters are flat out amazing. As a writer myself, the characters that Whedon creates are some of the best that I've ever watched on TV or film. Incredible writing and special effects augment this series, along with the plain reality of it all. So it's 500 years in the future. Who says we've got warp speed? Who says violence has ended? Whedon sticks it plain when the crew of the Serenity are looking for jobs to keep them afloat rather than make first contact with an alien race.There are plenty of little things that you will enjoy from this collection. The camera and special effects take advantage of the zoom lens (which you'll learn in the features section that mostly everyone not with the &quot;Firefly&quot; team thought was cheesy). The music is incredible. For example, since space is a vacuum, we don't hear anything in the CGI scenes except for wonderful violins and guitars. You see the cast is really a family when the camera stops, and when you watch the &quot;making of&quot; featurette, you'll see how heartbreaking it was for this cast to all of a sudden wrap up and end production.The cast! Whedon strings together a cast of actors that most people don't know. Nathan Fillion (TV's &quot;Two Guys, A Girl, and a Pizza Shop&quot;) and Adam Baldwin (various movies and appearances) are the biggest names you might know. But, either way, the actors stick their characters without any flaws. Apparently 10 million viewers weren't enough for Fox, who pretty much killed this series. Props to Universal for producing the 2005 movie, which may just be the first in a trilogy. Either way, expect Fox to be brooding for a long time.",5,What A Surprise,1085097600,"05 21, 2004",2004,2600,"['roomate', 'recommended', 'series', 'highly', 'one', 'boring', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'quot', 'JD', ""'re"", 'watching', 'quot', 'was', 'bit', 'excited', 'first', 'roomate', 'knew', 'liked', 'history', 'science', 'fiction', 'knew', 'was', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'who', 'wrote', 'script', 'quot', 'Alien', 'Resurrection', 'quot', 'liked', 'never', 'got', 'liking', 'quot', 'Angel', 'quot', 'quot', 'Buffy.', 'quot', ""'d"", 'figure', 'was', 'worth', 'shot', 'boy', 'was', 'surprised', 'watched', 'first', 'disc', 'second', 'disc', 'straight', 'laughed', 'sighed', 'screamed', 'enjoyed', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'before', 'When', 'finished', 'series', 'later', 'watched', 'special', 'features', 'knew', 'had', 'buy', 'it.You', 'can', 'read', 'Amazon', 'review', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'adapt', 'quot', 'Whedonese', 'quot', 'chinese', 'cursing', 'What', 'really', 'will', 'get', 'attention', 'are', ""n't"", 'aliens', 'run', 'characters', 'are', 'flat', 'amazing', 'writer', 'characters', 'Whedon', 'creates', 'are', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'TV', 'film', 'Incredible', 'writing', 'special', 'effects', 'augment', 'series', 'plain', 'reality', '500', 'years', 'future', 'Who', ""'ve"", 'got', 'warp', 'speed', 'Who', 'violence', 'ended', 'Whedon', 'sticks', 'plain', 'when', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'are', 'looking', 'jobs', 'keep', 'afloat', 'rather', 'make', 'first', 'contact', 'alien', 'are', 'plenty', 'little', 'things', 'will', 'enjoy', 'collection', 'camera', 'special', 'effects', 'take', 'advantage', 'zoom', 'lens', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'features', 'section', 'mostly', 'everyone', 'not', 'quot', 'Firefly', 'quot', 'team', 'thought', 'was', 'cheesy', 'music', 'incredible', 'example', 'space', 'vacuum', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'anything', 'CGI', 'scenes', 'wonderful', 'violins', 'guitars', 'see', 'cast', 'really', 'family', 'when', 'camera', 'when', 'watch', 'quot', 'making', 'quot', 'featurette', ""'ll"", 'see', 'how', 'heartbreaking', 'was', 'cast', 'sudden', 'wrap', 'up', 'end', 'production.The', 'cast', 'Whedon', 'together', 'cast', 'actors', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'TV', 'quot', 'Two', 'Guys', 'A', 'Girl', 'Pizza', 'Shop', 'quot', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'various', 'movies', 'appearances', 'are', 'biggest', 'names', 'might', 'know', 'way', 'actors', 'stick', 'characters', 'flaws', 'Apparently', '10', 'million', 'viewers', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Fox', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'killed', 'series', 'Props', 'Universal', 'producing', '2005', 'movie', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'first', 'trilogy', 'way', 'expect', 'Fox', 'be', 'brooding', 'long', 'time']",N/A

The funny thing was that I was desperate for a good sci-fi and FOX's brilliant decision to air the 2nd episode instead of the Pilot cost them at least one viewer.  Not that the 2nd episode was bad, but just a little hard to follow without any background.  After all the opening scene has 3 cowboy looking crew mates getting into a brawl in a tavern only to be saved by their spaceship at cliffs edge.  Immediately I turned it off and thought nothing of it.  I remember thinking: ""Cowboys in space""Years later a friend invited me to see the movie Serenity and I loved it.  It was later that another friend informed me that it had been the original Firefly series.  With a lot more knowledge of the characters from the movie, I watched an episode on Sci-Fi and immediately fell in love with it.For xmas, my wife and I purchased the DVD set and watch the whole series in one day.  From start to finish the entire series is exceptional!  Way better than most of the shows that manage to survive on the television and I can only shudder to think that it's because of a bonehead executive deciding they didn't want to give this highly touted (by them) show 2 hours to introduce itself.  I loved the pilot!While it's true that there is a certain wild west feel to the show, Firefox has so many elements that make it good.  There is tension, compassion and lots of humor, some of which can be campy.

766309,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B0000AQS0F,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[1, 1]","Firefly is a sad, sad story of a progressive, well written, well produced show that got booted way before it's time.  Fox television's decision to give the show the worst 'Real Estate' in prime time (Fridays at 8 PM), it's pre-empting by other shows and sports events, not playing the episodes in order and their refusal to promote the show beyond a few commercials surely contributed to it's low ratings.  It was hard to find and confusing to watch.  Never the less, critics praised it, and anyone who watches it (at least everyone I know, including my wife, who is not a Sci-Fi fan) loves it.  This show is a Greek Tragedy.  You could easily say this was the Star Trek for the next Millennium, a sci-fi 'western' that mirrored Gene Rodenberry's idea of 'Wagon Train in space'.  Not to say that the creator, Joss Whedon, was inspired by Star Trek, not at all.  Firefly is more liberal, and more relatable to the real world.  What shines is the cast and the writing.  The ingredients and settings are only slightly out of the ordinary, and in the hands of any average TV creator, would end up being bland and boring.  But the characters in Firefly are so well cast and the episodes so well written, that they stand out as real and tangible people who are cast together on this small ship for a purpose.The story takes place 500 years in the future, where a civil war has just ended and Capt Malcolm Reynolds has gathered together an eclectic crew to take on jobs in an old freighter ship called Serenity, Firefly class.  The ship is one of those So-Ugly-But-Cool, Hang-In-There-Old-Girl, She'll-hold-together, Rely-On-In-A-Pinch Flying buckets that everyone is so glad to see come over the horizon, that it's no wonder Whedon considers it the tenth character on the show.  Always low on fuel, its like the Millennium Falcon in Star Wars, it's destined to become a lovable freighter, and not a high tech ship of exploration.  The difference in characters of the human class is staggering.  You have a Two soldiers, the Captain and his second hand man...err woman, Zoe.  Zoe's husband Wash, who is the pilot.  A mercenary, Jayne, which is a great contrast when played by the muscle bound, 6'2"" Adam Baldwin.  A registered companion, Inara.  Kaylee, the spunky young mechanic who loves her ship, but is obviously too young to know better.  A Doctor and his Sister, Simon and River, who are being pursued by the Alliance due to River's extreme mental intelligence.  And to add wisdom, there's Book, a holy man of the time who seems to be searching for himself.  The dynamics of the characters add to instructing personality studies and contrasts.  They find themselves with nothing in common and sometimes, everything in common when they need each other most.  The possibilities of this show are endless and Fox foolishly dropped it without giving it a fair chance.  The DVD contains all episodes including three that never aired.  The sound and picture quality are superb and the bonus features are great.  Everyone should give this show a chance, to see it for more than just the Sci-Fi aspect, more than just the space adventure, but as a study in character interaction as well.

After seeing the final one, I can say that this show was absolute perfection.  It's like Star Wars told from the perspective of Han Solo, rather than Luke Skywalker, with the gunslinging smuggler and his crew being the main focus in the war against some Galactic Empire, rather than some mystical Jedi Knight.  Also, the war's over.  The Rebels lost and all is under the dominion of the Galactic Empire/Alliance which is mysterious while being deceptively kind and ""civilized"" as all governments are.In fact, I almost wonder if Joss Whedon is a libertarian.  There are some subtle anti-government elements in the show, such as in the vein of ""1984"".  Is is just me, or is anti-statism a major theme in most sci-fi?This show has the best of all the elements.  Great actors and actresses playing great characters with great dialogue, great plots, plot twists, music (whom hasn't memorized the lyrics to the theme song by the end?).  It's mostly a sci-fi Western with some elements of horror (who was freaked out by the blue-gloved men and their antics in the ""Aerial"" episode) and really great casual humor as well (who wasn't roaring in laughter during the episode where Jayne was mistaken by a town as some kind of Robin Hood-esque hero?).If you don't think that this show will go down as legendary, then name one other show that got cancelled after only eleven aired episodes (fourteen total) and yet had such a huge cult following of fans built around it that they made a movie out of it?In short, this series is absolute bliss and well worth your purchase.",5,"Will be legendary, despite Fox's cancellation",1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,1664,"['went', 'saw', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'video', 'had', 'see', 'episodes', 'show', 'seeing', 'final', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'show', 'was', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'Star', 'Wars', 'told', 'perspective', 'Han', 'Solo', 'rather', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'gunslinging', 'smuggler', 'crew', 'being', 'main', 'focus', 'war', 'Galactic', 'Empire', 'rather', 'mystical', 'Jedi', 'Knight', 'Also', 'war', 'Rebels', 'lost', 'dominion', 'Galactic', 'Empire/Alliance', 'mysterious', 'being', 'deceptively', 'kind', 'civilized', 'governments', 'are.In', 'fact', 'almost', 'wonder', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'libertarian', 'are', 'subtle', 'anti-government', 'elements', 'show', 'such', 'vein', '1984', 'Is', 'just', 'anti-statism', 'major', 'theme', 'most', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'best', 'elements', 'Great', 'actors', 'actresses', 'playing', 'great', 'characters', 'great', 'dialogue', 'great', 'plots', 'plot', 'twists', 'music', 'whom', ""n't"", 'memorized', 'lyrics', 'theme', 'song', 'end', 'mostly', 'sci-fi', 'Western', 'elements', 'horror', 'who', 'was', 'freaked', 'out', 'blue-gloved', 'men', 'antics', 'Aerial', 'episode', 'really', 'great', 'casual', 'humor', 'well', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'roaring', 'laughter', 'episode', 'where', 'Jayne', 'was', 'mistaken', 'town', 'kind', 'Robin', 'Hood-esque', 'hero', '.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'show', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'legendary', 'then', 'name', 'one', 'other', 'show', 'got', 'cancelled', 'only', 'eleven', 'aired', 'episodes', 'fourteen', 'total', 'yet', 'had', 'such', 'huge', 'cult', 'following', 'fans', 'built', 'made', 'movie', 'short', 'series', 'absolute', 'bliss', 'well', 'purchase']",N/A

When I see the look of confused shock on their faces it's time to elaborate a bit more.Seriously, Firefly has everything one could ask for in entertainment.  The writing is original and witty.  The humor is wickedly funny, especially as delivered by the incredibly talented and likable cast.  There are moments for every person and every mood.  This is the only show I have ever watched that can both make me laugh out loud and move me to tears, without being cheesy or overdramatic for a second. Everyone I have shown Firefly to has loved it...young or old, male or female.The show is set 500 years in the future, but this is not the sterile future so often portrayed....it has a very human and realistic feel that makes you think this is really what it might be like down the line.  Technological advances and political changes have taken place, but human society is very much the same.  It takes place partly in outer space and on multiple planets, but there are no aliens.The music on the show is unusual and grounds it as an almost down-to-earth story rather than your typical sci-fi fare. I always fast-forward the title credits and theme song on TV shows, but with Firefly I listen to the song and watch the beautifully done credits every time.There are 9 main characters in the show, and by the time you are halfway through the series they will become your second family.  The cast has such incredible chemistry and the writing is so good that it's impossible not to care about them deeply.Look at it this way; for a TV show that was cancelled in the middle of it's first season to not only be amazon's #3 best seller but to have gotten a major motion picture released based on it, it must be something pretty incredible.

I guess I always chose the wrong time to switch in though. Because now that I saw the whole series on dvd I see what I missed out on. This show is great fun and you never know what's going to happen next to the crew of Serenity. What helps is that the crew is unpredictable and you never know when they'll do something heroic or steal from other ships. The acting and characters are top-notch as well. There's nothing bad I can say about this series. I can't say I saw one bad episode. Even the episodes that didn't make it on tv blew me away. Those 3 are 3 of the most entertaining episodes too.In one of those you have Mal (Nathon Fillion) bumping into that foxy red head again who likes scam  men into thinking they're married to her. She has a heist planned that she wants Serenity to help her with. Which leads to one of the funniest endings. The 2nd one has Mal and Zoe open a package and find an old war buddy in it dead. However when an autopsy is about to be done, he appears to be very much alive. In the 3rd never viewed one. Serenity helps prostitutes battle a low life cowboy who wants to his baby from one of the women he got pregnant. He'll kill everyone of them until he gets it.Some of the characters remind me a little of Buffy characters. The pilot Wash has the sort of wise cracking lines that we were used to hearing from Xander Harris. While the adorable Kaylee, the engine repair girl reminds me of  Willow when she was innocent and sweet. Hell a lot of Mal's speeches or wisecracks sound like something Buffy would say too. It's fun though seeing Whedon put some of Buffy characters in each Firefly character. The cast had a strong chemestry too with just fantasic scripts to work with on each episode. Each one just got better and better. I'm just clueless to why this show was canceled. It's better than most shows that are on the air now. After getting into the series it made me behind Whedon all the way in bringing it to the big screen.

In fact, I saw a preview of it that FOX managed (rarely) to air, and was completely turned off. And then sometime about a year or so after it went off air, I heard about how GOOD Firefly was and a friend told me that if I liked Farscape (I LOVED Farscape!) that I would love Firefly. And he was right.It has everything I love: scifi action, world-building, unique and interesting characters (especially River and Mal), relationships that intrique (Mal and Inara! and Kaylee and Simon), and adventure, enough to keep me reeling for weeks.I fell for the series just about from Serenity. I knew not to watch from the order of the way FOX aired the episodes, and in my estimation, that asinine decision is a major contribution to the reason the series failed. It's not that it sucked.

The show has a much different feel to it than Whedon's other two shows, though his trademark humor and character development are still present. Combining a western feel to a Star Wars-like setting, Whedon creates a world unlike any seen before. The characters are all extremely likeable, and the actors to a terrific job portraying them, particularly Nathon Fillion as the lead of Captain Malcom Reynolds.The show's greatest weakness is perhaps it's criminally short length, though this is of no fault of the show itself or it's creator.

It's a little unconventional with the western/sci-fi mix, but it also adds unmeasurable charm and believability.  The characters seem pretty generic at first, but by the end of the 2-hour premier, their personalities come out.  By the end of the third episode, Mal and the gang feel like old friends.

The show was scheduled to run for 7 seasons and only made it through one (run out of order and only partly aired by Fox) before the network shut it down. After the DVD ends, you will still have a lot of questions about some of plot and the characters, particularly River and Shepard Book. Also, although originally billed as an action show, Firefly combines that with a drama - it's as if you bought a video game expecting Mortal Kombat and got Final Fantasy: the action, although not constant, is there, but so is a lot of intricate plot, which depending on your tastes can be good or bad.With that said, Firefly gets off to a fairly slow start, but when it finds its groove (depending on who you talk to, 2-4 episodes in) it really takes off. The ensemble works extremely well together, and the characters, while somewhat archetypal, are endearing and easily related to. The effects are pretty good, and the plots are believable and well-thought out. I especially like the creative camera use, which did many shots off-center or with flare. The commentaries and special features are nice touches, but the real gem of the DVD is the show itself.Sometimes really good shows don't make it.

Joss Whedon doesn't settle for clean space battles with a few laser effects.  No, we get dramatic and extended chase scenes in the atmosphere of planets, with the terrain and clouds flying by; characters climbing around on the outside of the ship (again, while the ship is in the atmosphere with the wind whipping our heroes about), and all manner of cityscapes, spaceports, and landing pads.  Details, action, and effects certainly aren't the most important elements of a good science fiction show (great characters and great stories are), but one should be aware that this show delivers the important things AND isn't stingy with the thrills, effects, and &quot;wow&quot; factor.

766379,AM8K619L97JWR,B0000AQS0F,Joseph Rodriguez,"[13, 14]","Firefly is not your typical sci-fi series. Firstly, there are no aliens. It envisions a future where there may in fact be nonhuman life, but we haven't found it yet. Secondly, the world is considerably seamier than the airbrushed idyllic utopias so often seen in science fiction shows. All of the main characters are outcasts of some sort or other - they live on the edge and they're proud of the independence it gives them. Thirdly, it comes from the mind of Joss Whedon, the man behind Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. As you might expect, that means moral dilemmas, witty snarky dialogue, and a show that's never afraid to get emotionally heavy (as long as, y'know, it's okay to be witty and snarky about it).The titular Firefly is a ship, Serenity, owned by survivor of the war of independence - the losing side - Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion). Along with his former subordinate and current first mate Zoe (Gina Torres), he skulks through space trying to avoid the everpresent Alliance. Along the way, he's picked up quite a few fellow misfits: Wash (Alan Tudyk), Zoe's husband and the pilot of Serenity; Jayne (Adam Baldwin), a not-too-bright mercenary with an eye for the main chance; Kaylee (Jewel Staite), the ship's perky mechanic; Book (Ron Glass), a preacher who seems to know an awful lot about guns and the Alliance; and Inara (Morena Baccarin), high-class prostitute and the only vestige of respectability Serenity has.The story begins when two more runaways find their way onboard Serenity: Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and his sister River (Summer Glau). They're both on the run from the Alliance, who performed nefarious experiments on River that left her insane, but with certain mysterious skills that soon become apparent. With their arrival - and the discovery that there's very little the Alliance won't do to get River back - the story is thrown into motion.The show is top-notch in just about every aspect - character, dialogue, acting, music, special effects - and quite likely should have done well. However, it was broadcast by Fox, which is infamous for boneheaded programming decisions. In Firefly's case, they started with the second episode and ended with the first episode; showed almost every episode in between out of order; constantly pre-empted it and rescheduled it; and were all too ready to can it. Firefly was dead, with a run of 13 glorious episodes...or was it?Sales of this very DVD boxed set showed that there was indeed an audience for Firefly. And as of this writing, Universal Studios has released a feature film continuation called Serenity, written and directed by Whedon, and it has reached #2 at the box office. This may lead to a sequel, or sequels - I certainly hope so - or it may not. But either way, we've had hours of quality writing and acting thanks to Joss Whedon, and I thank him for that.I highly recommend this DVD boxed set to anyone, period.",5,A show dead before its time,1128643200,"10 7, 2005",2005,2903,"['Firefly', 'not', 'typical', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'Firstly', 'are', 'aliens', 'future', 'where', 'may', 'fact', 'be', 'nonhuman', 'life', 'have', ""n't"", 'found', 'yet', 'Secondly', 'world', 'considerably', 'seamier', 'airbrushed', 'idyllic', 'utopias', 'so', 'often', 'seen', 'science', 'fiction', 'shows', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'outcasts', 'sort', 'other', 'live', 'edge', ""'re"", 'proud', 'independence', 'Thirdly', 'mind', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'man', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Angel', 'might', 'expect', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'witty', 'snarky', 'dialogue', 'show', 'never', 'afraid', 'get', 'emotionally', 'heavy', 'as', 'long', ""y'know"", 'okay', 'be', 'witty', 'snarky', 'titular', 'Firefly', 'ship', 'Serenity', 'owned', 'survivor', 'war', 'independence', 'losing', 'side', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'former', 'subordinate', 'current', 'first', 'mate', 'Zoe', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'space', 'trying', 'avoid', 'everpresent', 'Alliance', 'way', 'picked', 'up', 'quite', 'few', 'fellow', 'misfits', 'Wash', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'Zoe', 'husband', 'pilot', 'Serenity', 'Jayne', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'not-too-bright', 'mercenary', 'eye', 'main', 'chance', 'Kaylee', 'Jewel', 'Staite', 'ship', 'perky', 'mechanic', 'Book', 'Ron', 'Glass', 'preacher', 'who', 'know', 'awful', 'lot', 'guns', 'Alliance', 'Inara', 'Morena', 'Baccarin', 'high-class', 'prostitute', 'only', 'vestige', 'respectability', 'Serenity', 'story', 'begins', 'when', 'two', 'more', 'runaways', 'find', 'way', 'Serenity', 'Simon', 'Tam', 'Sean', 'Maher', 'sister', 'River', 'Summer', 'Glau', ""'re"", 'run', 'Alliance', 'who', 'performed', 'nefarious', 'experiments', 'River', 'left', 'insane', 'certain', 'mysterious', 'skills', 'soon', 'become', 'apparent', 'arrival', 'discovery', 'very', 'little', 'Alliance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'get', 'River', 'back', 'story', 'thrown', 'motion.The', 'show', 'top-notch', 'just', 'aspect', 'character', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'music', 'special', 'effects', 'quite', 'likely', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'However', 'was', 'broadcast', 'Fox', 'infamous', 'boneheaded', 'programming', 'decisions', 'Firefly', 'case', 'started', 'second', 'episode', 'ended', 'first', 'episode', 'showed', 'almost', 'episode', 'order', 'constantly', 'pre-empted', 'rescheduled', 'were', 'too', 'ready', 'can', 'Firefly', 'was', 'dead', 'run', '13', 'glorious', 'episodes', 'was', 'Sales', 'very', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'set', 'showed', 'was', 'indeed', 'audience', 'Firefly', 'writing', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'released', 'feature', 'film', 'continuation', 'called', 'Serenity', 'written', 'directed', 'Whedon', 'reached', '2', 'box', 'office', 'may', 'lead', 'sequel', 'sequels', 'certainly', 'hope', 'so', 'may', 'not', 'way', ""'ve"", 'had', 'hours', 'quality', 'writing', 'acting', 'thanks', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'thank', 'that.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'set', 'anyone', 'period']",N/A

When it was later canceled I was not surprised. When Firefly was later released on DVD I heard nothing but praise for this show and how great it was. I admit my curiosity was peaked but I still was not ready to give it a try. Then I heard rumblings that there was a movie in the works based on the show. That along with many of my friends telling me to buy this was enough for me to give it shot. I watched this whole boxest over the period of two days. I was shocked at how good this show was. And I was also angry with myself for never giving this show a chance back when it originally aired on television. But then I realized that I wasn't the only one and now there are thousands of us who have just now discovered this great show on DVD. This show is unlike anything I have ever seen on television and it works. Also it was one of the first sci-fi programs I had ever seen that remembered that in space there is no sound. So during the battles in space you hear nothing and I love that. I really enjoyed all of the characters and looked forward to each episode and what would happen to them next. Also after the first few episodes I found myself singing along with the theme song and still do every once and awhile. But all good things must come to an end and I was disappointed when I had finished the set knowing that there would be no more episodes. But as I mentioned, there is a film that will be released later this year and I cannot wait. I think anyone who is on the fence about this show should take a chance, as I did, and buy this set. And if you don't want to buy it, rent it or borrow it from a friend and I am sure you will end up buying a copy of your own before long.

766384,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B0000AQS0F,Joshua Koppel,"[2, 10]","I am not surprised that this show was quickly canceled.  This is Joss Whedon's space western.  But this show was not cancelled because of bad acting, bad writing, lame episodes, or any of a dozen other common reasons.  The simple fact is this is a nothing show.  It is sort of like having a bunch of expensive, high-class furniture sitting in an empty lot.  In otherwords, quality merchandise with no framework.  I thouroughly enjoyed the acting, the humor, the drama, and the plots but I still could not help noticing that there is no series framework.We have a space ship with a crew and several passengers.  The ship and crew are usually involved in illegal activities and some of the passengers are on the run from the law.  The Captain and first officer were involved in the losing side of a war and one of the law-fleeing passengers was mistreated by the government.  But why do we care about these people?  They are criminals.  There is nothing given to show that the government is bad except for what might have been done to one of the passengers.  We know nothing of the war other than who won (and one episode paints both sides as uncaring although it wasn't aired).  Unlike Joss's Buffy, there is no ""in every generation..."" framework or a ""five year mission"" like in Star Trek.  There is nothing.  I wish there was because the show had great potential and some of the best acting and drama of any series but it was ultimately fine furniture in a vacant lot.  So all we really have are a bunch of stories that happen to use the same characters but there is little to connect them and hold them together.I know my review will not be popular with fans of the show (of which I am now one) but anyone who has seen the series should be able to see the truth in what I say.  If Joss has supplied that one last piece maybe this wonderful show would not have been cancelled so quickly.  There is one advantage to the lack of framework and that is that the show is much more watchable as an unfinished work than other shows cancelled in their first season.",4,A Show About Nothing,1173484800,"03 10, 2007",2007,2058,"['am', 'not', 'surprised', 'show', 'was', 'quickly', 'canceled', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'space', 'western', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'cancelled', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'writing', 'lame', 'episodes', 'dozen', 'other', 'common', 'reasons', 'simple', 'fact', 'nothing', 'show', 'sort', 'having', 'bunch', 'expensive', 'high-class', 'furniture', 'sitting', 'empty', 'lot', 'otherwords', 'quality', 'merchandise', 'framework', 'thouroughly', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'humor', 'drama', 'plots', 'still', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'noticing', 'series', 'framework.We', 'have', 'space', 'ship', 'crew', 'several', 'passengers', 'ship', 'crew', 'are', 'usually', 'involved', 'illegal', 'activities', 'passengers', 'are', 'run', 'law', 'Captain', 'first', 'officer', 'were', 'involved', 'losing', 'side', 'war', 'one', 'law-fleeing', 'passengers', 'was', 'mistreated', 'government', 'why', 'do', 'care', 'people', 'are', 'criminals', 'nothing', 'given', 'show', 'government', 'bad', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'one', 'passengers', 'know', 'nothing', 'war', 'other', 'who', 'won', 'one', 'episode', 'paints', 'sides', 'uncaring', 'was', ""n't"", 'aired', 'Joss', 'Buffy', 'generation', 'framework', 'five', 'year', 'mission', 'Star', 'Trek', 'nothing', 'wish', 'there', 'was', 'show', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'best', 'acting', 'drama', 'series', 'was', 'ultimately', 'fine', 'furniture', 'vacant', 'lot', 'really', 'have', 'are', 'bunch', 'stories', 'happen', 'use', 'same', 'characters', 'little', 'connect', 'hold', 'together.I', 'know', 'review', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'popular', 'fans', 'show', 'am', 'now', 'one', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'truth', 'what', 'say', 'Joss', 'supplied', 'one', 'last', 'piece', 'maybe', 'wonderful', 'show', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'cancelled', 'so', 'quickly', 'one', 'advantage', 'lack', 'framework', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'watchable', 'unfinished', 'work', 'other', 'shows', 'cancelled', 'first', 'season']",N/A

766405,A26X2TG93OTXVU,B0000AQS0F,Justin Heath,"[30, 32]","The world is divided into people who get Firefly and people who don't. In this series Joss Whedon created one of the most realistic post-war visions of the future ever committed to tape, that at the same time spoke about yesterday and today. Maybe a little too much today for its own good.The series is anti-corporate, anti-government and, while it takes the stand that some things are worth fighting for, it is largely anti-war. No wonder FOX did everything in its power to kill it off, including airing episodes out of order, skipping weeks after airing only three eps and, inevitably canceling the show without even airing episodes 12, 13 and 14 (out of 15). This was particularly damaging, as Firefly had a greater sense of ongoing plot than any other Whedon series in its first year. Viewers were left wondering, on more than one occasion, when a character would reference something we hadn't seen yet.The backstage dramatics aside, Firefly is intelligent and, like Buffy, mythic - except this time Whedon is dealing with the myth of America: the Frontier, the Civil War, the rise of the Corporation, etc . . .Firefly is a demanding show. It asks its audience to appreciate the shades of Grey in its characters' moral scale. The villains are not comfortingly dressed as an alien race. In 500 years mankind will still be its own worst enemy. Technology will be in the hands of a privileged few, and others will in ""The Black"" - Whedon's frontier third world - where it is possible to exist without the interference (or benefit) of civilization and government. Things will be dirty, and used. Firefly creates a universe that almost totally opposes that of (that bastion of television sci-fi) Star Trek: its Federation-like central power (the Alliance) is interpreted as being oppressive and dystopic.

766407,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B0000AQS0F,kaduzy,"[8, 65]","I was so set to give this five stars.  I was really enjoying the show, the characters (The sole exception being the character of River Tam, who got incredibly annoying with the ""craziness.""  I know the show was canceled before they could fully explain what her problem was, but that was dragged out for far too long.) and the world Joss Whedon created.  I am a big Whedon fan so it was no surprise that the show would be good but I wasn't expecting it to be THIS good.Then along came the last episode, ""Objects in Space"" and it killed a lot of the joy I had built up for the show.  I am dumbfounded by that episode, which features a black male character threatening two white female characters with rape and sexual torture.  The whole thing harkened back to the days decades ago when every black man was seen as a potential sexual threat to white women.  The script was written in such a way and his lines were given in such a way that there could be no escaping this racist subtext.  I felt like I had turned off ""Firefly"" and somehow started watching ""Birth of a Nation.""  It was totally baffling how that got A) written, B) filmed and C) aired.  Aside from that, the episode's plot was preposterous, the pacing lethargic and the entire thing awful, awful, awful.The other awful things about this show are the theme song (hands down the worst I've heard for any show) and the DVD menus, which are totally primeval.  There are no extras menus and if you want to access the commentaries, you must do so via the ""language"" option on each individual episode screen.  There are more special features on the fourth disc, but they're sparse and underwhelming.  Mostly everyone just cries about how the show was canceled.However, if you skip the last episode and try to overlook the other downsides, you'll likely enjoy this show.  It's innovative, it's well-written and it has all the hallmarks of a Joss Whedon universe.

766408,A2D3L9CJZCN7UY,B0000AQS0F,"Kansas_Jones ""He's Dead Jim""","[4, 4]","Over two thousand reviews? I'm still going to put my two cents worth into the mix about my Big Damn Heroes.We all pretty much know the back story, but I'll keep it quick for any new fans who might be perusing this review area: Firefly was a short-lived science fiction TV series that got knocked out of the box way before it's time. In the aftermath, a legion of loyal fans (that's Browncoats to you civilians, and smile when you say it partner) rose up to the challenge to keep the series alive.This DVD collects the 14 episodes that comprised the TV Series.**general spoilers**Firefly, at it's core entertainment value, follows the adventures of a rag tag crew of mercenary adventurers under the command of Captain Mal Reynolds, a former sergeant in the Independents.Some years back, a civil war erupted between the Alliance, who wanted to incorporate all the planetary colonies under one flag, and the Independents, folks along the outer colony planets who weren't very happy with that option. The short version is, the Independents lost.Zoom forward a few years, and you have displaced former soldiers such as Mal and his former squad mate and now First Mate, Zoe, who are now seeking out a means of survival.The code is simple: Find a crew, find a job, keep flying.Along the way, Mal and Zoe gather a rather interesting sort of crew:Hoban ""Wash""  Washburn, the slightly off kilter ace pilot. Married to Zoe, the couple embodies the whole opposites attract thing.Jayne Cobb, a mercenary for hire who'd just as soon shoot you in the leg in exchange for some moola, yet has *some* good in him and that thick head of his.Kaylee Frye: Sweetheart of the universe, and a dang fine mechanic that can coax the firefly class bucket that they all zoom around in to keep on flying.The above characters were already on board at the start of the series. The Firefly series proper actually picks up at the point in time where Reynolds takes on three passengers: Doctor Simon Tam, Shepherd Booke, and River Tam, Simon's slightly mentally impaired sister.Tam is a deposed doctor who is on the run with his sister. Booke is a preacher by trade, but not much is known about his past. River is...eccentric. Yet, Reynolds needs paying fares (and he'd never admit it, but a good heart) and takes on the passengers.The Alliance is ever present, and the commanders of the organization continue to govern. Another threat out in the Black of space is the Reavers - men now gone deformed, sick with rage, and cannibalistic that prey on travelers.I love the Firefly concept: A space western, with some American Civil War overtones and Asian language and design thrown in for good measure; you have this crew that zips around in a Firefly class ""jack of all trades"" science fiction transport ship called Serenity (named after the decisive and heartbreaking final battle that saw the end to the war), yet Mal walks around wearing a six gun holstered low on his hip, a long brown duster coat (from his sergeant days, and where the ""Browncoat"" moniker comes from, describing the men and women who fought against the Alliance), and occasionally spouting off in Asian-type slang.The series is a gritty look at science fiction. No aliens here, everyone is human. The ports that Serenity pulls into can range from buzzing metro to down and dirty frontier planets. My personal favorites (though all of the installments are good) of the episodes are Ariel and Out of Gas. There is no such thing as an easy way to live, and the crew takes on what jobs they can to survive even if the job is illegal, borderline illegal, on the level, or somewhere in between all of that.The DVD collection is comprised of 14 episodes. If you like good science fiction, a good western, and some space adventure bolstered by an ensemble cast - do yourself a favor and purchase a copy of the DVD so you can check out a cancelled TV show that deserved so much better.Can't stop the signal......",5,Best Dang Heroes,1275868800,"06 7, 2010",2010,3939,"['two', 'thousand', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'still', 'going', 'put', 'two', 'cents', 'worth', 'mix', 'Big', 'Damn', 'Heroes.We', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'back', 'story', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'quick', 'new', 'fans', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'perusing', 'review', 'area', 'Firefly', 'was', 'short-lived', 'science', 'fiction', 'TV', 'series', 'got', 'knocked', 'box', 'way', 'time', 'aftermath', 'legion', 'loyal', 'fans', 'Browncoats', 'civilians', 'smile', 'when', 'say', 'partner', 'rose', 'up', 'challenge', 'keep', 'series', 'alive.This', 'DVD', '14', 'episodes', 'comprised', 'TV', 'Series', '**general', 'spoilers**Firefly', 'core', 'entertainment', 'value', 'adventures', 'rag', 'tag', 'crew', 'mercenary', 'adventurers', 'command', 'Captain', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'former', 'sergeant', 'Independents.Some', 'years', 'back', 'civil', 'war', 'erupted', 'Alliance', 'who', 'wanted', 'incorporate', 'planetary', 'colonies', 'one', 'flag', 'Independents', 'folks', 'outer', 'colony', 'planets', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'happy', 'option', 'short', 'version', 'Independents', 'lost.Zoom', 'forward', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'displaced', 'former', 'soldiers', 'such', 'Mal', 'former', 'squad', 'mate', 'now', 'First', 'Mate', 'Zoe', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'seeking', 'out', 'means', 'survival.The', 'code', 'simple', 'Find', 'crew', 'find', 'job', 'keep', 'way', 'Mal', 'Zoe', 'gather', 'rather', 'interesting', 'sort', 'crew', 'Hoban', 'Wash', 'Washburn', 'slightly', 'kilter', 'ace', 'pilot', 'Married', 'Zoe', 'couple', 'whole', 'opposites', 'attract', 'thing.Jayne', 'Cobb', 'mercenary', 'hire', 'who', 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'shoot', 'leg', 'exchange', 'moola', 'yet', '*some*', 'good', 'thick', 'head', 'his.Kaylee', 'Frye', 'Sweetheart', 'universe', 'dang', 'fine', 'mechanic', 'can', 'coax', 'firefly', 'class', 'bucket', 'zoom', 'keep', 'flying.The', 'characters', 'were', 'already', 'board', 'start', 'series', 'Firefly', 'series', 'proper', 'actually', 'up', 'point', 'time', 'where', 'Reynolds', 'three', 'passengers', 'Doctor', 'Simon', 'Tam', 'Shepherd', 'Booke', 'River', 'Tam', 'Simon', 'slightly', 'mentally', 'impaired', 'sister.Tam', 'deposed', 'doctor', 'who', 'run', 'sister', 'Booke', 'preacher', 'trade', 'not', 'much', 'known', 'past', 'River', 'eccentric', 'Reynolds', 'paying', 'fares', ""'d"", 'never', 'admit', 'good', 'heart', 'passengers.The', 'Alliance', 'ever', 'present', 'commanders', 'organization', 'continue', 'govern', 'threat', 'out', 'Black', 'space', 'Reavers', 'men', 'now', 'gone', 'deformed', 'sick', 'rage', 'cannibalistic', 'prey', 'travelers.I', 'love', 'Firefly', 'concept', 'space', 'western', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'overtones', 'Asian', 'language', 'design', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'have', 'crew', 'around', 'Firefly', 'class', 'jack', 'trades', 'science', 'fiction', 'transport', 'ship', 'called', 'Serenity', 'named', 'decisive', 'heartbreaking', 'final', 'battle', 'saw', 'end', 'war', 'yet', 'Mal', 'walks', 'wearing', 'six', 'gun', 'holstered', 'low', 'hip', 'long', 'brown', 'duster', 'coat', 'sergeant', 'days', 'where', 'Browncoat', 'moniker', 'describing', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'fought', 'Alliance', 'occasionally', 'spouting', 'off', 'Asian-type', 'slang.The', 'series', 'gritty', 'look', 'science', 'fiction', 'aliens', 'here', 'everyone', 'human', 'ports', 'Serenity', 'can', 'range', 'buzzing', 'metro', 'down', 'dirty', 'frontier', 'planets', 'personal', 'favorites', 'installments', 'are', 'good', 'episodes', 'are', 'Ariel', 'Out', 'Gas', 'such', 'thing', 'easy', 'way', 'live', 'crew', 'what', 'jobs', 'can', 'survive', 'even', 'job', 'illegal', 'borderline', 'illegal', 'level', 'somewhere', 'that.The', 'DVD', 'collection', 'comprised', '14', 'episodes', 'like', 'good', 'science', 'fiction', 'good', 'western', 'space', 'adventure', 'bolstered', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'do', 'favor', 'purchase', 'copy', 'DVD', 'can', 'check', 'out', 'cancelled', 'TV', 'show', 'deserved', 'so', 'much', 'better.Ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'signal']",N/A

766413,A1ZJJWF69R31ZL,B0000AQS0F,"Kate Fredericks ""Kate""","[1, 1]","I have been meaning to write a review of Firefly for a long time. To this day, I regret losing this wonderful series in it's infancy. I was one of those people who didn't watch it when it was on, but found it a couple of years later.This true gem, with it's eclectic cast of talented people brought to us by Joss Whedon, as noted by the thousands who have reviewed it here, and reviewed it recently, has probably become the standard for almost perfect sci fi. Nathan Fillion, now known as Richard Castle, will never eclipse his role as Mal Reynolds, captain of his spit and duct taped spaceship, Serenity. The rest of the crew already named here probably a thousand times, can thank Firefly for their still huge popularity and success today. Those of us who love Firefly do so with great passion and loyalty.What exactly defines the wonderful series as what has become not just a cult series, but also simply a fan favorite is the magic this cast (and crew) weaved in each episode. It was far ahead of its time with stories so varied, smart and many times very funny, they can be watched again and again and one never tires of it. I still find it hard to believe this series was cancelled after only 13 episodes and the movie, Serenity, did not wow the box office as it should have. That is on we, the people, for not showing up and supporting it when it was needed the most.As for should you, the few people who have not seen it yet, should you get it and watch it? A resounding yes! I'm sure it's not for everyone, but if you like smart, sweet, excellent entertainment, it doesn't hurt to give it a chance. While the series 13 episodes are stand alone and the movie, Serenity, does tie it up, I suspect you will join the ranks of the rest of us who wish the network had made a bolder decision and stuck with it. Like NCIS today, which began around the time Firefly was on, it would have built its audience and those of us who miss it dearly would have many more episodes to watch over and over again. I join the many voices here and tell you to buy this wonderful, once in a lifetime series, and envy you that you get to watch it for the first time.

I bought the box set just a few days ago and have already watched all 14 episodes. This series has everything- an interesting plot, fascinating three dimensional characters and a fantastic setting. Fox made a big mistake when they cancelled it. I don't know why they didn't give it a better chance to succeed. It was mishandled from the very beginning- I won't go into the details, but Fox basically shot themselves in the foot here.Anyway, I would recommend this set to anyone who enjoys character development, humor, drama, romance, action, adventure, etc.There's only one downside-after watching all the episodes offered, you're left wanting more. Each character has a mystery in their past and none are solved in this box set-which is maddening, I admit. But what's there is so good, it's worth the aggravation of being left hanging.

I stopped the episode and moved on to something else.Attempt 2 (several months later)- I'm not sure what possessed me to try again, but I gave it another shot. After making it through the rough scenes of the first episode, I emerged on the other side and didn't look back. It has the Shadowrun (Sega Genesis) type plot line that I really enjoy. The characters are quirky, the story lines interesting, and I couldn't wait to tag along for the next adventure of the Serenity.The final episode seemed out of place with the others, but maybe they knew things were being shut down and decided to try and wrap things up differently.My only real complaint with the show is the opening song.

Normally, I love sci-fi, but this goes to show that with bad enough writing, even sci-fi can be rendered completely inane.Ever since at least Star Wars, the idea of combining space ships with familiar stories has been there-- sword & sorcery, warfare, ancient mythology, etc.  It works when the familiar stories are handled by good writers.  The story is what carries it, whether or not it takes place in the past or future, or what the technology is.  This attempt to merge with westerns might have been good if the writing was up to par with any decent westerns, but it came up laughably short in that department.The pilot introduced the characters as you would expect, and already they were landing on alien planets where an ambush with bad guys on horseback was in store, where the three heroes handily win the day over impossible odds, all the good guys are crack shots and the bad guys can't hit the side of a barn.But when the second episode opens with a barroom fight scene where the main character is just acting totally stupid, and they get out of another impossible-odds old-west-style situation by pulling their spaceship up behind them from below the edge of a cliff was just too much (where have I seen that before?)-- I had to hit eject there and put it back up for sale on Amazon.No wonder it didn't even last a season, that should have been an important clue.  Anyone who thinks it has ""cult status,"" must either stand to gain on the profits of its sale, or is no more than about 12 years old.

What Firefly is, is ambitious and audience-centered in a way little TV sci-fi has been since the original Star Trek.  It anticipates a smart audience and rewards them with humane, high octane stories about clever characters in sophisticated situations.  So naturally it got cancelled.Dare I say that the best thing about Firefly is that it's incomplete?  Only fourteen episodes were made, introducing a story lush with promise and an energetic ensemble immersed in the kind of work that most actors long for.  It is this promise, unsullied by later network interference, which I think makes this the best TV to hit DVD in years.Beyond the writing, acting, and direction, all of which are superb, this show has some of the best visual design I've seen in decades.  Joss Whedon studied how space flight takes place even now, and reflected the cramped quarters, austere living conditions, and blue-collar immediacy missing from more slick productions.  Firefly is the latest true embodiment of George Lucas' vision of ""used space.""Firefly didn't find its audience until it was out on DVD, but it's clear why this story inspires comic books, a feature film, fan fiction, and a massive fan culture despite its brief span.  For true believers in TV as art, this show sums up the promise that the medium rarely accomplishes.

That's not surprising, since network television rarely draws me in these days. So, when a friend invited me over to watch the ""Firefly"" DVDs, I had no idea what to expect. It was Joss Whedon's reputation, and my enjoyment of his previous shows that drew me.""Firefly"" is a space opera of sorts, taking place in a Western (as in cowboys) themed universe, where many earth cultures have blended together. Characters lapse into Chinese when cursing. There is a school of thought among sf fandom that, when a show has to resort to the cowboy episode (as the original Battlestar Galactica series did in the first season), the writers are truly lost for ideas. I had mixed feelings about the show's merits, until I got into it a bit.If I were to take ""Firefly"" too seriously, I think it's a show I'd probably detest, but 30 minutes of viewing convinced me that Joss Whedon had a sense of humor about him when conceiving and executing this short-lived series.The ""Firefly"" universe is a universe populated by rogue space cowboys, escorts, religious fanatics and a somewhat under-explained political struggle loosely mirroring Star Wars' The Empire and Rebellion. There's irony everywhere, some truly cheesy writing (and acting) and some great special effects.While I enjoyed the campiness of the show, I'd hate to leave the reader with the impression that the sometimes over-the-top humor is the only reason to watch. There are some truly superlative moments, running the gamut from tense to heart breaking. The interlaced humor serves not only the audience in making the show more enjoyable, but the character development as well.Overall, ""Firefly"" is probably one of the best sf shows I've ever seen. Take any aspect of the show and drop it into another reference frame, and one would run for cover. Somehow, Whedon manages to pull all of these strange odds and ends together into a cohesive unit that is really entertaining.Aside from the episodes, the extras on the DVD (including the gag reel) are well worth viewing, though - truth be told - I could probably go a lifetime without hearing the theme song again.While it helps to watch the episodes in order, once the characters are explained, each episode is great for stand-alone viewing.

766453,A15AMUTKT7GZ6,B0000AQS0F,Kris James,"[1, 1]","Joss Whedon's universe is gloriously fresh and beautifully flawed. He paints the aftermath of the war of unification with bright strokes, showing the richness of the Alliance planets, and their mutual success, support, and military might, as well as the can-do, independent spirit of the rim worlds who struggle daily with the little they have. With an entire galaxy to play with, there's plenty of room for individual stories to portray the clashes that arise in such a widely variant setting. And our guides on that journey all have their own stories to tell along the way.On the smaller scale, some of the main characters aboard the Serenity have taken sides on the war issue--along with all its sub-issues, such as what jobs they're okay taking part in--and some haven't, creating a delightful mix of viewpoints on the everyday workings of the spacecraft and how to get by. And no one is inflexible; all the characters grow and change over the course of the series, organically adapting as we all do to new situations. Love, fear, loyalty, friendship, greed...it's all in there.The episodes take us to a vast range of locations--some poor, smarmy, struggling, and backstabbing, and some rich and flush with the new technology, and all that it entails. Captain Reynolds and his crew generally know what to expect in the former, but they know they must be constantly aware of shifting alliances and unseen trouble in the latter, as well. Basically, it's true what the character Zoe says about the captain: the war never ended for him. He has to fight every day for his ship and his crew, against everyone that survived the war he fought in. But he's clever and he's got a resourceful band of allies, and they do the best they can to keep flying.The dialogue in this series fascinates me. The words and phrases it uses, whether borrowed from Mandarin (the other surviving language from old Earth) or whether patched together in space-Western style, clearly help to define the feel of the show itself. As a proud Browncoat, I can always identify other Browncoats by the way they talk about this series. And, of course, by the fact that they can't shut up about it.",5,"Space Cowboys?

The show itself had its flaws, no question. The standard romantic subplots were not only predictable, but sometimes horrifying to watch (Sean Maher's ""Simon"" talking to Jewel Staite's ""Kaylee"", for example). The tired Remington Steele-Scully/Mulder ""In love but in denial"" sequence has been played to death well before now, and took some more hits in this series.Ron Glass as Shephard Book was denied some decent lines, given some great ones, and often forced to play the relatively unconvincing role of one Who Brings Inappropriate Morality To The Forefront. It was grating, sometimes, to see such obviously weak characterization forced into play.Those were some of its weaknesses, and they were glaring. But the show drew me in despite these flaws. The interactions between crew members, especially the moments of normal life, were compelling. This cast obviously enjoyed working together, and the writing for them was typical of Joss's style: realistic conversations between real people.First sci-fi show I've seen where ships in space make no sound. Gunshot wounds bleed, and continue bleeding. People (especially Malcolm Reynolds) make hard choices, and ethics in a hard life aren't as clear-cut as we've been told to believe.The surprising humor of this show, which was a mixture of great interactive writing and excellent deliveries from the cast, was a true treat to see.Essentially, and I suppose I could have summarized it earlier, Firefly was truly a Space Western. Exploring the lives of gritty anti-heroes, nasty villians and hardships both personal and environmental in an action-packed way.It was NOT realistic. But it wasn't supposed to be. It was supposed to be a saga of anti-heroes, a couple of rebels, a treacherous lunk, two felons and a ship built for smuggling, and what they did in the worlds around them, both good and bad.For what it was supposed to be, Firefly performed exceptionally well. Even my bride-to-be, who hates westerns, found herself involved in the show and wanting to see what happened next. That Firefly was given a bad air-time, weak advertising, inconsistent scheduling, and eventually cancelled, is not at all related to how well crafted the product was.If you liked the Spaghetti Westerns, Batman (the movie) and/or Alien Resurrection, you'll want to see this show.If you watched the series already, then I doubt anything will keep you from getting the set. ;)",5,"The series, not the DVDs.

It was a great show that ended too early. Every episode, I grew to like the characters more and more.  The crew of the Serenity was a group of very unique personalities and you grew to accept them as part of your family. You not only like these people, you learn to care about who they are and how they came to be on Serenity.Captain Reynolds kept you smiling with his laid back ways yet he had a heart of gold. His humor and compassion reminded me of a cross between Hans Solo and Indiana Jones.I've described this show to others as a western science fiction show.  It is set in space yet it is filled with scenes with horses, shoot-outs and bar room brawls. Everything about it makes it enjoyable and fun.Even though humor is a part of ""Firefly"", there are moments of intense drama and darkness.

766471,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000AQS0F,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[31, 33]","I got both ""Firefly: The Series"" and the movie ""Serenity"" for Christmas.  The former is the late lamented television show that was the brainchild of Joss Whedon, creator of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"" (which explains why the title ""Joss Whedon's 'Firefly'"" appears a lot).  The four-DVD set ""Firefly: The Complete Series,"" includes all 15 episodes of the series, which is set 500 years in the future and reminds those of a sense of television history that ""Star Trek"" was originally sold as ""Wagon Train"" to the stars, because the western elements of this series are as strong as the science fiction elements.Since this is a Joss Whedon creation the obvious question is what sort of twists did he put into this one? The most obvious is that this is a science fiction series without aliens. Apparently there was nobody out there after all (or else they are hiding really well). The other major twist is that in the future there were just two superpowers, the United States and China, which explains why the characters tend to curse in Chinese now and then. I think if more people had known that there was a television show that was more explicit that ""South Park"" that would have meant high enough ratings for ""Firefly"" to survive. Finally, you have to appreciate that if this is Western set in outer space it is one that existed after the Civil War. Clearly Captain Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) has the die-hard spirit of a bitter Confederate veteran.From my perspective the only real problem with ""Firefly"" is that it lacks a strong story arc for this abbreviated first season. I might be making too much of this, but one of the strengths of Whedon's other shows was that he always makes excellent use of story arcs, using by wedding a first half story arc to another one in the second half of season. The closest things we have to driving story arcs are (1) the mysterious Alliance forces trying to capture River (Summer Glau) and her brother Simon (Sean Maher) and (2) Mal and Irana (Morena Baccarin) wasting time insulting each other instead of getting on to business (so to speak). Both of those are clearly there, but things were progressing too slowly for my taste. I know Whedon had some big payoff for the first one, but he was keeping it awfully close to the vest and if this revelation is not a major part of the planned movie, I will be totally surprised.The strength of the series is in the characters of the crew, all of who are realized with some degree of depth. My favorite was Kaylee (Jewel Staite), who was smart as she was cute, a killer combination in my book. Captain Mal Reynolds was the most fully realized of the crew, mainly because he had a pivotal role in most of the episodes, but with the rest of the crew of ""Serenity"" you know there was more to come. We got a little of the back story on what Mal and Zo (Gina Torres) did during the big war, and there was a flashback that told how Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin) and the rest of the crew were hired on by Mal. But it is the secret behind River Tam's strange condition that is is going to be the key in everything that happens next, which you will now when you watch ""Serenity."" It was also great to see Ron Glass as another familiar face in the regular cast.Of the 15 episodes collected here eight of them have commentary by various cast members (Fillion, Baccarin, Tudyk, and Staite) and writers (Whedon, Tim Minear, and Jane Espenson) and others.  The additoinal special features include three behind the scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, Alan Tudyk's audition, Joss Whedon singing the ""Firefly"" Theme, and a gag reel (the last three are actually three separate things).  Each DVD comes with its own thin plastic CD box with shots of Mal Reynold, Shepard Book, Jayne Cobb, and Zoe Washburne posing in front of assorted nebulas on the respective covers (Notice that the alien landscape continues inside the slipcase).The more I watch ""Firefly"" the more it grows on me (Kaylee is currently my favorite character with her combination of cuteness and competence, although after watching ""Serenity"" it is hard not to be totally captivated by Summer Glau's River).  I just wish ""Firefly"" had not come at the expense of ""Dark Angel"" in terms of FOX's willingness to spend money on a show with a big special effects budget.  The irony that both shows were gone before the 2002-03 season was half over is not lost on me either. In a much better world than this one both shows would have survived, but having neither is really the short end of the stick for fans of science fiction on television.",5,Another television show with great potential gets shot down,1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,4579,"['got', 'Firefly', 'Series', 'movie', 'Serenity', 'Christmas', 'former', 'late', 'lamented', 'television', 'show', 'was', 'brainchild', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'creator', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Angel', 'why', 'title', 'Joss', 'Whedon', ""'Firefly"", 'lot', 'four-DVD', 'set', 'Firefly', 'Complete', 'Series', '15', 'episodes', 'series', 'set', '500', 'years', 'future', 'sense', 'television', 'history', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'originally', 'sold', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'stars', 'western', 'elements', 'series', 'are', 'as', 'strong', 'science', 'fiction', 'elements.Since', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'creation', 'obvious', 'question', 'what', 'sort', 'twists', 'did', 'put', 'one', 'most', 'obvious', 'science', 'fiction', 'series', 'aliens', 'Apparently', 'was', 'nobody', 'there', 'else', 'are', 'hiding', 'really', 'well', 'other', 'major', 'twist', 'future', 'were', 'just', 'two', 'superpowers', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'why', 'characters', 'tend', 'curse', 'Chinese', 'now', 'then', 'think', 'more', 'people', 'had', 'known', 'was', 'television', 'show', 'was', 'more', 'explicit', 'South', 'Park', 'would', 'have', 'meant', 'high', 'enough', 'ratings', 'Firefly', 'survive', 'Finally', 'have', 'appreciate', 'Western', 'set', 'outer', 'space', 'one', 'existed', 'Civil', 'War', 'Clearly', 'Captain', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'die-hard', 'spirit', 'bitter', 'Confederate', 'veteran.From', 'perspective', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'Firefly', 'strong', 'story', 'arc', 'abbreviated', 'first', 'season', 'might', 'be', 'making', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'strengths', 'Whedon', 'other', 'shows', 'was', 'always', 'excellent', 'use', 'story', 'arcs', 'using', 'wedding', 'first', 'half', 'story', 'arc', 'one', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'closest', 'things', 'have', 'driving', 'story', 'arcs', 'are', '1', 'mysterious', 'Alliance', 'forces', 'trying', 'capture', 'River', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'brother', 'Simon', 'Sean', 'Maher', '2', 'Mal', 'Irana', 'Morena', 'Baccarin', 'wasting', 'time', 'insulting', 'other', 'instead', 'getting', 'business', 'so', 'speak', 'are', 'clearly', 'there', 'things', 'were', 'progressing', 'too', 'slowly', 'taste', 'know', 'Whedon', 'had', 'big', 'payoff', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'keeping', 'awfully', 'close', 'vest', 'revelation', 'not', 'major', 'part', 'planned', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'totally', 'surprised.The', 'strength', 'series', 'characters', 'crew', 'who', 'are', 'realized', 'degree', 'depth', 'favorite', 'was', 'Kaylee', 'Jewel', 'Staite', 'who', 'was', 'smart', 'was', 'cute', 'killer', 'combination', 'book', 'Captain', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'was', 'most', 'fully', 'realized', 'crew', 'mainly', 'had', 'pivotal', 'role', 'most', 'episodes', 'rest', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'know', 'was', 'more', 'come', 'got', 'little', 'back', 'story', 'what', 'Mal', 'Zo', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'did', 'big', 'war', 'there', 'was', 'flashback', 'told', 'how', 'Jayne', 'Cobb', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'rest', 'crew', 'were', 'hired', 'Mal', 'secret', 'River', 'Tam', 'strange', 'condition', 'going', 'be', 'key', 'everything', 'next', 'will', 'now', 'when', 'watch', 'Serenity', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'Ron', 'Glass', 'familiar', 'face', 'regular', 'cast.Of', '15', 'episodes', 'collected', 'here', 'eight', 'have', 'commentary', 'various', 'cast', 'members', 'Fillion', 'Baccarin', 'Tudyk', 'Staite', 'writers', 'Whedon', 'Tim', 'Minear', 'Jane', 'Espenson', 'others', 'additoinal', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'three', 'scenes', 'featurettes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'audition', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'singing', 'Firefly', 'Theme', 'gag', 'reel', 'last', 'three', 'are', 'actually', 'three', 'separate', 'things', 'DVD', 'own', 'thin', 'plastic', 'CD', 'box', 'shots', 'Mal', 'Reynold', 'Shepard', 'Book', 'Jayne', 'Cobb', 'Zoe', 'Washburne', 'posing', 'front', 'assorted', 'nebulas', 'respective', 'covers', 'Notice', 'alien', 'landscape', 'slipcase', 'more', 'watch', 'Firefly', 'more', 'Kaylee', 'currently', 'favorite', 'character', 'combination', 'cuteness', 'competence', 'watching', 'Serenity', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'totally', 'captivated', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'River', 'just', 'wish', 'Firefly', 'had', 'not', 'come', 'expense', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'terms', 'FOX', 'willingness', 'spend', 'money', 'show', 'big', 'special', 'effects', 'budget', 'irony', 'shows', 'were', 'gone', '2002-03', 'season', 'was', 'half', 'not', 'lost', 'much', 'better', 'world', 'one', 'shows', 'would', 'have', 'survived', 'having', 'really', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'fans', 'science', 'fiction', 'television']",N/A

I'm a full time student with a full time job so I'm pretty wary when it comes to taking on new interests that have the potential to distract me from studying. Let's face it; normal people can read a book or watch a TV show and move on with their lives, but nerd hobbies are all-consuming. Fearing a repeat of last summer (during which time I watched all 5 seasons of ""Angel""), I decided to give ""Firefly"" a shot only when I found out how short the series was. ""Just 14 episodes and a movie?"" I thought, ""How consuming an interest could this show possibly be?""Well what do you know? I'm hooked. I was hooked right away, in fact. The theme song got me. (I'm not even kidding.) I've read some books in my life that really had a profound effect on me. I've seen fewer movies that moved me as much. But for a television show to do the same is exceedingly rare.As of now, 3,110 people before me have written 5-star reviews about how ""Firefly"" is one of the greatest shows of all time, and about what a waste of potential its premature cancellation was. Honestly, there's not much I can say that hasn't been said by at least a couple thousand other ""Browncoats."" The one bad thing about my ""Firefly"" experience is that watching it was a little bittersweet. On my first viewing, it was a bit depressing to take such a heartfelt interest in the characters, all the while knowing there was so little left of it to see.Fortunately fans have been given some closure with the excellent 2005 film ""Serenity."" No, it's not the 5-7 (or so) seasons the series deserved to have, but it's a fitting end nonetheless. Having seen the film, I no longer feel depressed when watching the episodes.So if you're even later to the ""Firefly"" party than I was, I highly recommend that you see it.

So many of my friends kept gushing about it, tossing about words such as ""inspired,"" ""visionary,"" and the like. So, I decided I had to see what they were talking about.Unfortunately, I came to a conclusion very early on in my viewing, one that didn't change through the rest of the episodes. Other than the Holy Trinity of Clint Eastwood spaghetti Westerns, from which I can quote most of the dialogue and feel compelled to watch whenever I run across them on TV -- I don't like Westerns. I don't hate them but at best I'm just indifferent to them; they bore me.Being as objective as possible, I think Joss had an awesome idea. Sure, _Star Wars_ was the original Western in space, but Firefly didn't try to disguise it under a thick layer of pure sci-fi, it *was* a Western. It just happened to have spaceships and other planets. It's brilliant, really, and on the right network it should've run for a good five seasons. The acting was good, the plots were good and it had a loyal audience. FOX sucks as a network, that was the problem.But even if it'd had a seven to ten year run, I wouldn't have been one of the regular viewers. The only episodes I truly enjoyed were the ones that took place solely within Serenity or within space itself, where it became straight sci-fi with little to no western in sight. Once they hit planetside, my interest waned and I started looking at the clock on my DVD player, counting down the minutes until it was over.The theme song was pretty bad, too. Yeah, the words were good, but the tune sucked and so did the singing. But, then again, I think country music sucks as a whole, so I'm probably biased.This really wasn't the series for me, unfortunately, but that wouldn't stop me from recommending it to people who like westerns, which I've done many times since.

But I have been a Joss Whedon fan since the first season of Buffy.  And you know what?  Even I didn't watch Firefly when it came out on Fox.  I saw about 15 minutes of it and thought, enh.  Then the series came out on DVD, Serenity was being made into a movie, and I thought I'd give it another chance.  I'm so glad I did.  There are some great episodes here, and they're (gasp!) in order -- Fox originally showed the second episode first for some reason, it kept getting pre-empted and moved around so it never really found a home.The pilot is a wonderful introduction to the series, but one of the best episodes, Out of Gas, also serves as a good introduction.  Just watch it, you'll see.Also I'd recommend watching the bonus features at the end (and I never watch those).

It came in and I started watching and well I stopped after the third show. Time passed and the movie came out and I bought it,watched it, and I had my fill of FIREFLY. Then this summer{2007} I moved and as I packed I found my copiy of FIREFLY.  When I unpacked I put it out on the DVD player for later. Well after five years I got around to watching it.  I watched all 13 shows and the extras.  There are FIREFLY addicts out there who love this show as the Trekkies love STARTREK.  However I am not one of those, but I fell under FIREFLY's spell.  I really loved the characters, the ship, and the music. The later episodes were eye openers for me.  They contained subject matter that I never expected from this series.  For example Inara's love interest with another woman.  Mal's love scene with a madame.  The married couple preparing for battle and fighting over having a baby.  The last show about the bounty hunter really made me sad because it broght up things that I wanted anwers to, i.e when the bounty hunter said that Book was no shepard.  Remember the show when he got shot and produce his id and the Alliance went all respectfull?  River's deadly shooting was just beginning to show.  Well I could go on and on.  The point for a buyer is that this series was truly too good for tv and we will never see this type of show again.

766507,A1DZNXO12ZRTFV,B0000AQS0F,"L. Veal ""Marrach""","[18, 19]","When this show debuted the networks tried to bill Firefly as a ""Hip"", ""Funny"", Sci-Fi Western. I still remember the quick-flick promo commercials.""Hip"": that word has been used so much it has lost its original meaning. Firefly stayed away from Star Trek cliches and worse. It was crafted deeply and thoroughly so that nothing in the sets, the FX or the characters would make it ""Dated"". It is just as clean to watch NOW in the age of IPods, as it was years and years ago. The show is not about Technology-- It's about people. That's people with a small 'p'. People like us. Not loverboy Captain Kirk. Not Stuck up Janeway. Not ""Give-me-a-break"" Paternal Picard. Mal is just. . .Mal. Like River said: ""Bad, in the Latin.""""Funny"": In TV land, to call a show Funny is to tell the average viewer they are watching a comedy show. And the average viewer (And I'm not being insulting) who wants to see a comedy is turned off when they are subjected to something different and edgy. Firefly is ""Witty"" in the dramatic way: Edgy, Cutting-- its humor is the smile that comes between sorrows. The laugh is evoked seamlessly without need of an actor's pause for the laugh-track. There are NO lauigh-tracks. In fact, the scene has already moved past the moment that has you chuckling. And in the next instant, blood will pulse from a knife slash and no-one's smiling anymore. The characters are in pain, leaving the formerly chuckling audience wincing in sudden deep, quiet discomfort. Your average TV viewer does not like being made unconfortable by a show they were told would  be ""funny"". That, in turn, made the TV Exec's uneasy. Firefly was not following a formula. Even the sexuality woven into the show was NOT following TV land conventions. It was all tension, tension, tension- with no simple happy resolution at the end of the hour.""Sci-Fi Western"": Admittedly, a different approach, a flavor. But ""western"" can also be a term of derision. Forget Western and think ""Frontier"" in its classic sense. You only see a horse once in a LONG while for the entire series. Cows-- only once or twice. But remember that the Westerns that endure to this day were about the stories of the people on the prairie-- not the Prairie itself, not the horses, not the guns. Think about it--- A horse is a cheaper means of transport on a planet without roads. And Cows? Man without Beef? Never!A fan of ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" would see a parallel here.Firefly is NOT a failed Series. TV/Cable/Broadcast Media Failed to recognize a well crafted piece.The Movie Serenity will complete this partial gem. I suggest you watch Firefly now.

When that happened, I immediately dismissed the show as crap, because of the description listed for the item.  I mean, really.  It made it sound like your run-of-the-mill SciFi channel crapola.  ""Stake a claim in the action?""  ""Take any job... to keep fuel in the tanks and food on the table?""  ""Desperate to steer clear of Alliance ships and the flesh-eating Reavers who live on the fringes of space?""  That, friends, is a recipe for an unimaginative, worthless and otherwise forgettable TV series.Thank goodness the description was so stupidly wrong.I'm not sure why I even went out and bought it, two months later.  But, WOW, I'm glad I did.Sure that hard-boiled-frontiersman-outlaw-rough-and-tumble-badass description is part of the show.  What the box doesn't tell you is that -- apart from the very, very good pilot episode -- none of that stuff is at the forefront.  It's never just about the job they're doing, or the money they need, or about running from Reavers, or even running from the Alliance.  Because the writers knew that would be dumb.This show is, honest to goodness, about the characters.  Even the gratuitous geisha (yes, I know they call her a ""companion,"" but I *didn't* know that when I was deciding whether or not to buy the show... and yes, she is gratuitous, so please don't ravage me for not understanding why she's there) character has some manner of depth.  While we may not like every aspect of every character, or even understand why they were written in, the characters are always the focus.  Their decisions, emotions, actions and concerns are what makes the show more than just a scifi/western/action show.But let's not forget the scifi/western/action elements.

Completely, totally, irretrievably and obsessively hooked.  I have not been so taken in by a series since...well, I can't really remember.  I have proudly upheld Firefly's 5-star rating here on Amazon, and I do so with absolutely no reservations.  Everything about this show was original, interesting, and well done.  Lots of humor, angst, romance, drama and adventure - and great production values - make this a treat to see.  But the real strength lies in the ensemble cast and the subtle, deep and complex characterizations between them.

The plots and story lines are typical, as they have to be.  But the characters, regardless of their role in the passage they all take together, relate to and interact well with each other, each having their moments without anyone stepping on anyone's toes, contributing to the successful melding that is what makes the crew become more of a family, with characters, like most families, from strange to black sheep and near everything between, of which the viewer doesn't mind becoming a part, sharing the risks, joys, and sorrows, no matter that the circumstances of their existence are tongue-in-cheek.It's good, escapist fun that won't stress your mind; good to have around for those times, every couple of years, when you want to waste some.",4,"Han Solo, meet James West.",1289347200,"11 10, 2010",2010,2329,"['short-lived', 'Firefly', 'TV', 'series', 'motion-picture', 'successor', 'Serenity', 'are', 'not', 'science', 'fiction', 'Star', 'Trek', 'forgotten', 'forged', 'first', 'fan-recall', 'TV', 'sci-fi', 'are', 'also', 'fan-based', 're-born', 'fantasy', 'rather', 'vein', 'Star', 'Wars', 'crossed', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'James', 'West', 'where', 'getting', 'too', 'specific', 'rogues', 'banded', 'eccentrics', 'usually', 'shunning', 'fleet', 'ships', 'empire', 'operate', 'own', 'varietal', 'spaceships', 'including', 'Lockheed', 'SR-71', 'Blackbird', 'seen', 'streaking', 'sky', 'landing', 'sequence', 'steal', 'collectors', 'ray-type', 'gun', 'worlds', 'moons', 'environs', 'sci-fi', 'modernistic', 'dusty', 'frontier', 'ground', 'transport', 'horses', 'hovercraft', 'armed', 'weapons', 'ranging', 'modified', 'six-shooters', 'Winchester', '1860', 'carbines', 'including', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Wanted', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'sawed-off', 'large-looped', 'version', 'automatic', 'large-bore', 'weapons', 'today', 'armies', 'partially-effective', 'futuristic', 'sort', 'plasma', 'hand-held', 'device', 'battling', 'beginning', 'then', 'circumventing', 'victorious', 'controlling', 'empire', 'always-questionably-legal', 'quest', 'survive', 'other', 'ship', 'competition', 'clients', 'empire', 'murderous', 'sect', 'marauders', 'feared', 'extreme', 'violence', 'who', 'always', 'threaten', 'never', 'really', 'materialize', 'climactic', 'cleverly', 'also', 'stand-alone', 'crew', 'plots-on', 'keep', 'rickety', 'spaceship', 'named', 'Serenity', 'intact', 'supplied', 'when', 'conditions', 'are', 'seldom', 'ship', 'namesake', 'plots', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'typical', 'have', 'be', 'characters', 'regardless', 'role', 'passage', 'take', 'together', 'relate', 'interact', 'well', 'other', 'having', 'moments', 'anyone', 'stepping', 'anyone', 'toes', 'contributing', 'successful', 'melding', 'what', 'crew', 'become', 'more', 'family', 'characters', 'most', 'families', 'strange', 'black', 'sheep', 'everything', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'mind', 'becoming', 'part', 'sharing', 'risks', 'joys', 'sorrows', 'matter', 'circumstances', 'existence', 'are', 'tongue-in-cheek.It', 'good', 'escapist', 'fun', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stress', 'mind', 'good', 'have', 'around', 'times', 'couple', 'years', 'when', 'want', 'waste']",N/A

That was my first thought, but after seeing the first episode it had me hook, line and sinker. Joss is, once again, king of series tv. Not only because of putting this idea together, but also for finding the writers who can carry it off with the style that is this series.I am in love with this show so I am trying not to get mushy, but the characters are to die for. They are all so real, yet bigger than life. Captain Mal, while having a hidden soft side, is not someone that you would want angry at you. He WILL get the job done. Jayne is a character unto himself. He is hysterical at times. While he is the ""muscle"" in the show and I don't think you are really supposed to like him, he is adorable. Maybe not someone you would want to marry, but someone you certainly would want to date. Book...hummm...you have to wonder about him. Zoe and Wash are great together. A perfect blend. Wash is a scene stealer too. Simon and River are great to watch. You are always wondering what is coming up with the two of them. Inara and Kaylee are beautiful. You never get tired of the two of them.The main storyline rolls on show after show and never loses your attention. The substories are true treasures. If you have any interest in an engaging story, great effects and pure pleasure, this is the DVD for you.And a hearty ""Hurray"" that Serenity the movie will be coming out in theaters this fall.I am just thankful that I have DVD sets like this one so that I am spared that horrible reality tv that is everywhere now.

First was that I really didn't need to say anything as it had all been said so eloquently and often already.  Second, however, was how amazing it was that so many people have become or remained loyal fans of this too-short-lived show.  I have never before seen so many reviews for any item on Amazon which still maintained such a high rating.  The complaints are certainly few and far between.For this reason, I am throwing my $.02 in.  I can only hope that perhaps some network or studio exec is checking out these reviews and realizing that the audience for the show (and maybe the movie) is so much more vast than they assumed.As for the series, this is one of the overall best things I have seen on television.  I am a fan of Buffy and Angel, and so have some loyalty to Joss Whedon, the creator of both aformentioned shows as well as Firefly.  However, I am also a very critical television watcher.  I watch certain shows religiously but very little beyond those.  I wait for the diamonds in the rough and try to give them a chance to shine before giving up on them, but just have very little time to allow for this.Firefly did not make me go through this process.  It was shiny from day one, even given the idiotic network decision to air it beginning with episode 2 rather than the intended pilot.  I was a little confused as to who all these folks were, but the show engaged me immediately regardless.The concept is not as odd as it sounds.  The master storytellers at Mutant Enemy make this a completely believable universe, and the gifted actors do a wonderful job of bringing to life the characters that are the heart of the show.As I said before, all that can be said about Firefly has already been said.  All I will tell you is that, regardless of what genre of television you normally watch, you owe it to yourself to purchase or rent this DVD.  You will find yourself a member of the Browncoats in no time.Keep flying!",5,There's no place I can be since I found Serenity,1075161600,"01 27, 2004",2004,2023,"['Having', 'glanced', 'hundreds', 'reviews', 'amazing', 'series', 'had', 'two', 'thoughts', 'First', 'was', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'say', 'anything', 'had', 'been', 'said', 'so', 'eloquently', 'often', 'already', 'Second', 'however', 'was', 'how', 'amazing', 'was', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'become', 'remained', 'loyal', 'fans', 'too-short-lived', 'show', 'have', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'reviews', 'item', 'Amazon', 'still', 'maintained', 'high', 'rating', 'complaints', 'are', 'certainly', 'few', 'far', 'between.For', 'reason', 'am', 'throwing', '.02', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'perhaps', 'network', 'studio', 'exec', 'checking', 'reviews', 'realizing', 'audience', 'show', 'maybe', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'vast', 'assumed.As', 'series', 'one', 'overall', 'best', 'things', 'have', 'seen', 'television', 'am', 'fan', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'so', 'have', 'loyalty', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'creator', 'aformentioned', 'shows', 'as', 'well', 'Firefly', 'However', 'am', 'also', 'very', 'critical', 'television', 'watcher', 'watch', 'certain', 'shows', 'religiously', 'very', 'little', 'wait', 'diamonds', 'rough', 'try', 'give', 'chance', 'shine', 'giving', 'up', 'just', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'allow', 'this.Firefly', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'go', 'process', 'was', 'shiny', 'day', 'one', 'even', 'given', 'idiotic', 'network', 'decision', 'air', 'beginning', 'episode', '2', 'rather', 'intended', 'pilot', 'was', 'little', 'confused', 'who', 'folks', 'were', 'show', 'engaged', 'immediately', 'regardless.The', 'concept', 'not', 'as', 'odd', 'master', 'storytellers', 'Mutant', 'Enemy', 'make', 'completely', 'believable', 'universe', 'gifted', 'actors', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'bringing', 'life', 'characters', 'are', 'heart', 'show.As', 'said', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Firefly', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'will', 'tell', 'regardless', 'what', 'genre', 'television', 'normally', 'watch', 'owe', 'purchase', 'rent', 'DVD', 'will', 'find', 'member', 'Browncoats', 'time.Keep', 'flying']",N/A

The first episode hooked me bad.  No Star Trek anything here.  Scummy, run-down, selfish renegades, insanity, good boys gone bad, and Animal Mother.  What more could you want?As others have said, if you're reading this, you know the plot/premise, so I won't dwell on that too much.  The anti-utopian universe of this show, however, flies in the face of virtually all space-set television from the 1950's on.  Weedon combines paranoia about big government with piratical parasites, mixing in a dose of The X-Files and a hit of Blue Velvet just to make me shiver with halluncinatory delight.Most sci-fi shows have been about maintaining the status quo, including all the white knights who pilot the UFP starships across re-run hell. Firefly is about running away from the culture, about a failed rebellion against a totalizing post-capitalist galaxy that offers citizens every advance, but brooks no individual eccentricity. The characters on Firefly have been flushed into the sewer of this Universe and they like it.The utter nihilism of this show impressed me.  On the first episode, where the crew betray their smuggling operation to supply drugs to impoverished minors, the gangsters thugs come to menance them and one swears to hunt the crew to the ends of the universe.  Our captain kicks the thug into the turbo fan. I loved the show from that point on.Sure, there were weak points, and the plots didn't always skirt the absolute edge all the time, but seeing a totally immoral, amoral, and vicious character like Adam Baldwin's play against the goody-goody doctor and his crazed sister was just fine with me.Fox made a mistake cancelling this show.

It is a strange combination of cowboy lore and SciFi, which is unique and fun.The actors immediately caught our interest and we were able to get to know them fairly quickly. We thought they worked well together in their various missions and troubles. We especially liked the fact that the captain stood firm on his convictions and was able to command the ship/crew in a strong and sensitive kind of way. He is also a bit of a mystery.For the SciFi and story lines, I would give this series four or five stars. However, the sexual innuendoes, and occasional crassness forces me to give it only three stars, and in some episodes deserve one star on this count. The next to the last episode -- I think one of the unaired episodes -- was especially crass and the sexual theme was distasteful to us. Unfortunately, the captain was unable to stand firm in the midst of temptation as well, which was disappointing.Most of the episodes are not like this and many times we ended an episode wishing for more. We were sorry to see the series end, despite my negative review in part. There are many loose ends which would be nice if they were resolved. I agree with many reviewers: it is frustrating that networks lower the boom on the continuation of a series without giving the writers and producers enough time to wrap up details. I guess that is the way it is in network television, one of the reasons we have stopped watching network TV.Bottom line: a fairly good series that SciFi lovers will enjoy.

After watching it, I can't believe that I passed on such a wonderful series - or the stupidity of the FOX network in botching its presentation.I'm not going to echo the same praises sung by the many positive reviews of this set, only to say that I am in agreement with the wonderful things written about it.  This is television at its best, with quality acting, good special effects, and some of the best writing around.  Each episode draws viewers into a developing story, and while not every episode is perfect (in particular, I found ""Safe"" to be rather formulaic and disappointing), each can also stand alone in its own right as an entertaining tale.But one of the most interesting aspects of the set wasn't on the discs but on the slip cases.  The progression of the episodes in the set seems natural upon viewing, yet upon reading the airdates of the shows I began to understand why the show was cancelled.  They offer stark testimony of how FOX shuffled episodes around and broadcast them out of sequence, turning a clear and progressive narrative into a confusing jumble of events.  It's led me to conclude that in this day and age the only way to truly appreciate what the creators of television series are trying to achieve is on DVD, where it can escape the idiotic tinkering that network executives constantly undertake.So watch this and see a television series as its creator intended it to be seen, free from the moronic meddling of network executives that have marred the fate of so many good shows.",5,The way great television should be seen,1077840000,"02 27, 2004",2004,1652,"['must', 'confess', 'missed', 'Firefly', 'brief', 'run', 'was', 'only', 'introduced', 'when', 'friend', 'gave', 'set', 'Christmas', 'watching', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'passed', 'wonderful', 'series', 'stupidity', 'FOX', 'network', 'botching', 'presentation.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'echo', 'same', 'praises', 'sung', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'set', 'only', 'say', 'am', 'agreement', 'wonderful', 'things', 'written', 'television', 'best', 'quality', 'acting', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'best', 'writing', 'around', 'episode', 'viewers', 'developing', 'story', 'not', 'episode', 'perfect', 'particular', 'found', 'Safe', 'be', 'rather', 'formulaic', 'disappointing', 'can', 'also', 'stand', 'alone', 'own', 'right', 'entertaining', 'tale.But', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'set', 'was', ""n't"", 'discs', 'slip', 'cases', 'progression', 'episodes', 'set', 'natural', 'viewing', 'yet', 'reading', 'airdates', 'shows', 'began', 'understand', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'offer', 'stark', 'testimony', 'how', 'FOX', 'shuffled', 'episodes', 'broadcast', 'sequence', 'turning', 'clear', 'progressive', 'narrative', 'confusing', 'jumble', 'events', 'led', 'conclude', 'day', 'age', 'only', 'way', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'what', 'creators', 'television', 'series', 'are', 'trying', 'achieve', 'DVD', 'where', 'can', 'escape', 'idiotic', 'tinkering', 'network', 'executives', 'constantly', 'undertake.So', 'watch', 'see', 'television', 'series', 'creator', 'intended', 'be', 'seen', 'free', 'moronic', 'meddling', 'network', 'executives', 'have', 'marred', 'fate', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'shows']",N/A

I found myself along these same lines mainly because of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Slayer and Angel and I've never considered myself a fan of his work. While I had watched Buffy on more than one occassion it was mainly due to the fact that there was nothing else on at the time so I watched it during those offbeat times.Then, when Firefly aired, I had caught an episode or two and soon stopped watching it for various reasons but I think the main reason was because it didn't hold my attention at the time. When the series was announced to be coming out as a DVD Boxed Set I was like okay, I think I'll pick this one up and considering that the price at the time, $34.99, was more than enough of a reason to check out this series. After watching the first episode, I soon remembered watching this series on television and sat through all 15 episodes of this set. I soon became enamored with this series and quickly wondered why this show hasn't been brought back by the powers that be.Recently, Universal Studios just released the movie Serenity, the big screen adaption of the television series which served to wrap up the lingering plotlines that were left open in the television series and served as a finale tribute to the short-lived television series. Even if there were no more Firefly projects in the works it was nice to return for a visitto this wonderful universe of characters.Josh Whedon's direction for this series is plainly evident in these epsiodes that accompany this wonderful set and considering the multitudes of science fiction that is available this is one of those very rare science fiction shows that actually fares a lot better than Star Trek, Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica, Farscape, Andromeda and the like. The writing for these characters in Firefly actually is so well written and well acted that you can't help but fall in love with the characters that take you along for their adventures.It's just a shame that not many science fiction fans have discovered this series just yet. There are some episodes that are quite amusing and the writing of some of the episodes is so well done that it's believable and doesn't leave you shaking your head and wondering how the shows writers can defy the laws of gravity or physics.

The funny thing is, i didn't even know it existed even after i had watched serenity.  I heard about it a little while after i had watched serenity, and always wanted to see it.  Finally about 6 years after watching serenity, i finally find firefly on netflix.Boy, i was in for a treat, this series became one of my favorites instantly.  The characters were well written and the actors played their parts perfectly.  None of the characters are left out, and you get to know them all on an individual level.  Learning about their relationship with each other and their personalities.My favorite characters were River and Kaylee.  Kaylee was entertaining with her crush on the doctor, and how he was so clueless to her advances.  She had a very bubbly personality though and was always upbeat and positive.  She was also a very hard worker and kept the ship going.River was also a entertaining character in her own way.  She always had the strangest comments and was a little off, but in a good way.  Her behavior intrigued me and kept me questioning what she was going to do next.All the other characters had their own unique personalities as well and were great in their own ways as well, those 2 were just my favorites.  Nathan Fillion is probably my favorite acting wise, i think he is a great actor, however his character just was not my favorite, but don't take that the wrong way, i don't mean it like i didn't like his character i just meant since the other 2 were my favorites that was why his was not.  I loved all the characters in the show, and my only complaint is, that it was canceled way to soon.I wish the show would have been on for a lot longer.  With less then one full season, it leaves a lot left out, even with the movie summing everything up.Now i guess i should tell you what the show is about and not just about the characters i liked.  These show is basically about space scavengers, in a way.  Nathan Fillion's character is captain of the firefly and they travel through space looting abandoned or destroyed ships that they find out in space.  They also take jobs from random people throughout the galaxy.  Most of the jobs are not always on the up and up, but they always pay well.  In a way they could be also called space pirates.  But they are good ones so that is all that matters, right.Nathan plays an ex military veteran who opposed the alliance, so now that the alliance has won the war, he must perform his missions under the radar of the alliance.

The best shows burn bright, hard and fast, and are always ultimately killed before their time. Firefly is the hardest example of this disturbing phenomenon. Fox wanted an action-oriented sci-fi franchise with a built-in fan base. Joss re-wrote and re-tooled and addressed every one of their notes. The show was groundbreaking, beloved by critics, and had a fanatical following before the first episode ever aired. So naturally, Fox dumped it in the time slot of death, Friday evenings, began the show by premiering with the second episode, not the pilot which explains who these people are and why you should give a damn, sporadically removing the show even from this slot some weeks, sometimes without even saying so. After 10 episodes, less than half a season, Fox canceled the series before it ever had a chance. The fans rallied, and Mr. Whedon was able to retain the rights to the show, shopping it around until Universal picked it up as the major motion picture ""Serenity,"" a bittersweet triumph of sci-fi that wraps the show up beautifully.

Not only will you be in for a corker of a movie, it's another pie in the face of Fox, the company that pulled this series from our screens. I am not a fan of Star-Trek, Buffy or Angel. To be honest, I find them a bit formulaic and bland. For me, Firefly is something entirely new. It is fresh, fiery and brilliantly different to any other sci-fi I have seen in recent memory. I am a believer that regardless of an astronomical budget, every Hollywood star out there and infinitely large explosions, good TV aint good TV if the script sucks. You will quickly find that the scripts for this series really do shine. The characters leap from the TV, the plots twist and turn and nothing is ever resolved by re-calibrating the discombobulator. It is a sad indication of the state of modern TV that this show was pulled. If Hollywood and big TV networks are anything, they are not risk takers. I guess the figures didn't instantly add up with Firefly and it was canned. I can only assume that Fox thinks that we, the public are unintelligent, unimaginitive suckers.

For some, nothing, or maybe at most some kind of bug with a beautiful name... For a few, like me and maybe you, ""Firefly"" is a great though somewhat weird show that was untimely cancelled by Fox. We were robbed of the opportunity of watching that show, but at least we enjoyed it while it was on air, so I think that we were the lucky ones...Fortunately, this dvd allows everybody to be a winner, in the sense that if you lost the opportunity of watching the series, you can do it now, and if you already watched and loved the series, you can watch it again as many times as you want.Should I tell you something about the series, in case you are completely clueless regarding ""Firefly""? Well, ""Firefly"" is a sci-fi Western produced by Joss Whedon, the person behind ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"". The series is set in the future, and it tells the story of a group of rebels that oppose the Alliance, a dictatorial government. These rebels live in a ship, the ""Serenity"", and their leader is Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), a former officer in a war against the Alliance that his side lost. We also have Zoe (Mal's second officer, played by Gina Torres) and her husband 'Wash' Washburne (a pilot, played by Alan Tudyk). We cannot forget the utterly unlikable Jayne (Adam Baldwin), Kaylee(a mechanic and an eternal optimist, played by Jewel Staite), Shepherd Book (Ron Glass), Inara (Morena Baccarin), Simon Tam (a doctor, played by Sean Maher) and his sister River (Summer Glau), a psychic on whom the Alliance experimented before she managed to escape.In a nutshell, this series is pure, unadulterated fun that was cut short for thousands due to the fact that it was cancelled when merely 11 of the 14 episodes this dvd contains had been aired. I suppose that the fact that Fox is behind the release of dvd could be seen as some kind of atonement for the cancellation of the show, I don't know. In any case, I am pretty sure that more people will become fans of ""Firefly"" after watching this dvd, and that won't hurt the chances that the show has of returning to the small screen.Finally, I would like to highlight the fact that the bonus features that ""Firefly"" offers are great, but what really completes this dvd is another one, ""Serenity"". ""Serenity"", now available in dvd format, is an excellent film directed by Joss Whedon and based on the ""Firefly"" series, that provides it with an interesting ending. If you can, purchase both ""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"" at the same time.

Real, clever, gritty heroes, who dressed like cowboys, flew spaceships, and cursed in Mandarin Chinese. They exchanged witty repartee, travelled the 'Verse from one end to the other looking for work (honest or not), and even attended a couple of Shindigs. When things got a little slow, there was always the psychotic psychically-gifted child to look after, or the flesh-mutilating cannibals from the edge of space to avoid.And then Fox, in a decision even more mind-numbingly stupid than airing any of its reality shows, cancelled it mid-season. Thanks to the efforts of Browncoats (as ""Firefly"" fans call ourselves), ""Firefly"" lives again, with all fourteen episodes (two of them originally unaired) and some juicy extras on four DVDs. Joss Whedon's sci-fi/Western/fantasy world - once described to me as ""Star Wars, but Han Solo's world, with Han still shooting first"" - is one of the most original things to air on television in a long while...possibly ever.""Firefly"" is set approximately five hundred years in the future, in a new universe with ""terraformed"" planets made inhabitable for Earth colonists, whose numbers have grown too many for Earth-that-was. Chinese and Western cultures are the dominant influences; characters dress like John Wayne and are fluent in Chinese, at least enough to swear in. Unlike most sci-fi, there are no aliens; the Reavers, cannibals who mutilate their own flesh and eat others, were once human too, till something drove them over the edge of sanity. The Alliance, a hyper-controlling government coalition of the central planets, manages most legal trade and activities, and have ever since they won a war some years back with the Independents (or ""Browncoats"").With the Alliance in control of all legal economic activity, those Browncoats were forced to retreat to the ""raggedy edge,"" taking what jobs they could to eke out an existence. Some of these are the crew of Serenity, a most rag-tag group of compatriots whose numbers include warrior woman Zoe; her husband, geeky pilot Wash; cheerful and nave mechanic Kaylee; gentle man of the cloth Shepherd Book; exotic geisha-like ""Companion"" Inara; ship's doctor Simon Tam and his genius but damaged sister River; and man's man Jayne, the blunt mercenary with a softer side. They are led by Captain Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds, who is if nothing else a man of determination, who lives by his own code of honor: stand by your crew, love your ship, get the job done.It is in this world, with these people, that ""Firefly"" makes its home. And what a home it is; even though we only get fourteen episodes, it is easy to develop attachments to these characters, and to care about what happens to them. Whedon's stories are tailored to provide layered character development, with each episode building on the last one's jokes and insights. Even Serenity, the ship itself, becomes a character of sorts: its nooks and crannies feel familiar and homely, something to be loved and protected.In this short span of time we also learn that Book is not all he appears to be, that River has been brutally experimented on by the Alliance to make her into a weapon, and that Mal has serious issues with womenfolk and relationships. It is sad that these hints of stories were cut off before they could be told; one senses that ""Firefly"" could have developed into the most interesting show on television if handled properly.What it undeniably is, however, is fourteen episodes' worth of brilliance. Whedon's dialogue is one of the high spots of the show: rarely has anything been as quotable as ""Firefly."" The wacky humor and the often unfamiliarly Westernized syntax give a simultaneously homey and foreign feel to the show and its characters; we recognize these people as kin to us, but maybe second cousins. The theme song is particularly good, an innately hummable ballad that will stick in your head even when you're not watching the show.The acting is truly amazing; although there are no big names here, everyone delivers heartfelt performances that feel real and personal; they make us care about their characters. It's hard to pick a standout performer; this crew works together as an outstanding ensemble, and they are the core of the show's strength.There's no shortage of action, either: as outlaws on the run from the government (and sometimes disgruntled employers), the crew of Serenity encounter their share of enemies, including the sadistic Dr Niska and the sinister bounty hunter Jubal Early. And there's River, too, prone to psychotic episodes that endanger everyone in her path.There are true gems even amongst the fourteen: my favourite episodes are ""Shindig,"" ""Our Mrs. Reynolds,"" ""War Stories,"" and ""Objects in Space."" All of them are excellent, but these four combine all the elements of style, dialogue, humor, and action into episodes that will inspire side-splitting laughter and some moments that will take your breath away.A sidenote: there is a movie addition to the Firefly 'Verse, in the form of ""Serenity."" It's darker and grittier than ""Firefly,"" but well worth seeing on its own merit as a fabulous space opera. So go ahead, embrace your inner Browncoat, and immerse yourself in the wonder of the Firefly-that-was. ""Take me out to the black, tell them I ain't comin' back; burn the land and boil the sea, you can't take the sky from me...""",5,Why would you leave Serenity?,1128297600,"10 3,

I love Trek, but the show always seemed more like a commentary on society.  It used aspects of science fiction as an allegory to address difficult issues of what was going on in the world in the late 60's.Now, with Firefly, it seems like Joss Whedon has finally realized Roddenberry's original dream.  This is a really fun show.  It is a science fictions show with cattle rustling, gun fights, whore houses, train robberies, bounty hunters, and so on.  Basically, all the essential elements to a great Western.  Admittedly, the show starts out a little dry.  It's my feeling that most shows start out that way, though, because you have to wade through all the introductions to characters, settings, and such.  That being said, by the time I was done with the first disc in the set, I was hooked.  To set the basic story, it takes place in the future where the only two surviving super powers are the United States and China.  This series takes place several years after a war, where a crew of misfits (the best kind of crews!) aboard a smuggling ship are trying to stay independent, and keep out of reach of an increasingly oppressive government.Firefly is something completely different than anything Whedon did in his Buffy shows.  The most noticeable difference is that Joss and crew are writing for adult characters, instead of characters in their late teens.  There is not the witty back and forth banter that was so characteristic of the Buffy shows.  The characters in this show are a little darker, but less brooding.  They are all conflicted, and they all have secrets to hide.  Sometimes the characters are almost more interesting for what they don't say.  There is a lot of mystery, and a lot of questions in this show.Unfortunately, this series is barely able to touch upon that.  It was canceled by Fox way too soon.  Too bad, because I think a second and third season could have been explosive.  Hopefully after the ""Serenity"" movie comes out (the new Firefly movie Joss is currently working on as I write this review), a new station will pick up the show and let him finish the story.  (I could be wrong, but I believe something similar happened to Babylon 5.)  Anyway, fans of action based science fiction who have been itching for something new should definitely pick up Firefly.  I think people who liked Joss Whedon's work on Buffy/Angel know what kind of stories he likes to weave; and if you enjoy that kind of depth and complexity, you really should check out this show.",5,"Now I really can't wait for the ""Serenity"" movie!!!",1100736000,"11 18, 2004",2004,2614,"['Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'originally', 'pitched', 'Star', 'Trek', 'networks', ""'Wagon"", 'Train', 'stars', ""'Gunsmoke"", 'space', 'love', 'Trek', 'show', 'always', 'seemed', 'more', 'commentary', 'society', 'used', 'aspects', 'science', 'fiction', 'allegory', 'address', 'difficult', 'issues', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'world', 'late', ""60's.Now"", 'Firefly', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'finally', 'realized', 'Roddenberry', 'original', 'dream', 'really', 'fun', 'show', 'science', 'fictions', 'show', 'cattle', 'rustling', 'gun', 'fights', 'whore', 'houses', 'train', 'robberies', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'so', 'Basically', 'essential', 'elements', 'great', 'Western', 'Admittedly', 'show', 'out', 'little', 'dry', 'feeling', 'most', 'shows', 'start', 'out', 'way', 'though', 'have', 'wade', 'introductions', 'characters', 'settings', 'such', 'being', 'said', 'time', 'was', 'done', 'first', 'disc', 'set', 'was', 'hooked', 'set', 'basic', 'story', 'place', 'future', 'where', 'only', 'two', 'surviving', 'super', 'powers', 'are', 'United', 'States', 'China', 'series', 'place', 'several', 'years', 'war', 'where', 'crew', 'misfits', 'best', 'kind', 'crews', 'smuggling', 'ship', 'are', 'trying', 'stay', 'independent', 'keep', 'reach', 'increasingly', 'oppressive', 'government.Firefly', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'anything', 'Whedon', 'did', 'Buffy', 'shows', 'most', 'noticeable', 'difference', 'Joss', 'crew', 'are', 'writing', 'adult', 'characters', 'instead', 'characters', 'late', 'teens', 'not', 'witty', 'back', 'forth', 'banter', 'was', 'so', 'characteristic', 'Buffy', 'shows', 'characters', 'show', 'are', 'little', 'darker', 'less', 'brooding', 'are', 'conflicted', 'have', 'secrets', 'hide', 'Sometimes', 'characters', 'are', 'almost', 'more', 'interesting', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'lot', 'mystery', 'lot', 'questions', 'show.Unfortunately', 'series', 'barely', 'able', 'touch', 'was', 'canceled', 'Fox', 'way', 'too', 'soon', 'Too', 'bad', 'think', 'second', 'third', 'season', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explosive', 'Hopefully', 'Serenity', 'movie', 'out', 'new', 'Firefly', 'movie', 'Joss', 'currently', 'working', 'write', 'review', 'new', 'station', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'show', 'let', 'finish', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'believe', 'something', 'similar', 'happened', 'Babylon', '5', 'Anyway', 'fans', 'action', 'based', 'science', 'fiction', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'itching', 'something', 'new', 'should', 'definitely', 'pick', 'up', 'Firefly', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'liked', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'work', 'Buffy/Angel', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'stories', 'weave', 'enjoy', 'kind', 'depth', 'complexity', 'really', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'show']",N/A

Fortunately, before that point we developed the technology for spaceflight, and the ability to quickly terraform asteroids and other planets.  So the folks with the tech did that, then scooped up whole populations of other folks and dumped them onto those terraformed places, with not much more than basic supplies, seeds, and food animals.So what you've got now is essentially what we had during the settlement of the American West: transplanted pioneers in isolated towns, some as little more than slaves to corporations and others with money.Of course, most don't know this because Fox, in its infinite wisdom, chose to show the episode that explains all this LAST.

Flash forward three years and I am a convert. I think after hearing that people were lining up for the pre screenings of the movie and hearing how dedicated all the fans were made me really curious. I think, always in the back of my mind, I thought that it couldn't be that bad if the name Whedon was on it. Having been a fan of Buffy and Angel for years, and loving them, and him delivering some of my favorite TV over the years, my curiosity got the best of me and boy am I glad it did.I watched the first two or three episodes and enjoyed it but it wasn't until about the 4th episode it really started to gel and show just how well written, dramatic and at times funny this show was. The mix of the character and interplay was very Whedon which made me want to watch more and more until I was finished within two weeks.The only bad thing? No more episodes to see how these characters grow.The good part, at least we get a Serenity movie.So now I can experience the rage that all fans felt when FOX yanked it prematurely from everyones living rooms.

We soon learn this is named after a battle that introduces us to [Nathan Fillion] Mal Reynolds, the captian of Serenity.  He seems to have fallen in love with this ship.I will admit that the presence of Adam Baldwin as Jayne Cobb was another reason I wanted to collect this series.  I certainly enjoyed the conflict and bonding of this group of characters and their risque way of talking.I didn't know that there was a difference between a ""Companion"" and a prostitute.  Morena Baccarin as ""Inara"" was very beautiful in this role.  It appeared that there was an intense attraction between Inara and Mal.The brilliant doctor, Simon and his genius sister, River added a great element of being on the run from the men in blue.They showed us the meeting of Wash as a great navigator and pilot of the Serenity and then we find out that he and Zoe, Mal's right hand warrior, are married.  When did Wash ask Zoe for her hand in marriage?  Eventually she says it is about time to have a baby - Wash seems reluctant.The intoduction to Jewel Staite as ""Kaylee"" was a bit torrid and a bit embarassing to Mal.  Kaylee was the only one that could keep Serenity in running shape.I about cracked up when ""Saffron"" claimed marriage to Mal and her seduction scene with Mal ending up flat on the floor.  And that wasn't the end of their association.Ah, but Jayne was a masculine riot.  I loved his character - his uncaring attitude which didn't hold, his flustered and embarassed attitude when he finds out that the mudders have made a hero out of his memory.  He definitely wants the reward for turning in the fugitives, Simon and River and then has to rescue them.The great scene [other than Mal being naked in the desert - a bit funny] was when they were standing on the edge of nowhere and Serenity appears in the back of them, rising like a giant monster.

Heather ""madjh""","[0, 0]","I must admit that as much as I absolutely adore Star Wars, I'm not a huge fan of Science Fiction (hides from all of the Trekkies in her family.) The beauty of Firefly is that Science Fiction is merely the backdrop for character driven scripts. While there are things that might concern parents of young children (some nudity, brief sex scenes and mild language,) this show is engaging and interesting to all types and ages of viewers. The characters all have many layers and throughout the four discs the audience really gets to know them and relate to them.I can see why Firefly was cancelled. It's one of those rare shows that crosses boundaries. It is undefinable in genre. It gets plopped into Sci-Fi, but it is so much more than that. It's a western, a drama, a situation comedy, a political commentary, a thriller/action... Perhaps Fox did not have the wherewithal to market this brilliant series to all of its potential viewers. I know I hadn't heard of it until after it was out on DVD and someone told me to rent it. Perhaps Fox was afraid of what the writers had to say in their scripts and how they went about saying it. For a show about thieves, there are a lot of moral tales.The series follows a Han Solo-esque Captain on his many adventures and show how a band of misfits joins up with him. It combine intricate morality issues with sex, violence and larceny, and does it all in such a way that your kids could wath it without much ado. The writing is brilliant and the actors are amazing. One is hard pressed to see that they are filming on a TV budget as the sets and costumes and cinematography are all top notch.As for the DVD's themselves, I'm a big fan of commentaries and several of the episodes have commentary tracks included. Hearing from a variety of cast and production crew is amazing and you really hear the love in their voices for this project. My only complaint is the navigation of the menu's is a bit difficult to manage on a PC. I alos wish there were more easter eggs as this is the sort of genre where you'd expect them.In a sense, I'm glad the show was cancelled. We now have a movie to watch and this is really a story for the big screen. Like the original Star Trek, I think Firefly's niche is about to be discovered in a series of feature length films... and why not? Another complaint I have about each episode is that they're over with far too quickly.

First, the pilot was remade because they wanted more action. Then, the network showed the episodes out of order. Normally this wouldn't be a major problem. But with the storylines that writer/creator Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was putting together, it became hard to keep up with the character changes. Not long into the first season, Fox cancelled it. To add to their already insulting treatment of the show, they showed the revamped pilot episode last.Some great writing, direction and acting made this an excellent series. Truly a western in space with super special effects as well.I am a bit bewildered by the choice to release the eps in full frame.

I had no faith in Joss Whedon to entertain me and the tiny bit of the show I saw once made no sense. No doubt because Fox directed that the episodes be aired out of sequence. Time passed.Thankfully, one night when there was 'nothing on' I settled on this. I don't remember which episode but I gave it a chance this time and within minutes I was hooked. I Tivo-ed it the next time it was on, from the beginning, and enjoyed the opening sequence. Just like that I was hooked. The characters are quirky but believable and well-developed enough that I wish there'd been more chance to show their growth. The scripts are clever and inventive, the stories are amusing but almost beside the point since what I enjoy is the way the characters interact.I especially enjoyed the ""Out of Gas"" episode with all the back-story about the crew forming and the launch of the Serenity.  But ""Our Mrs. Reynolds"" is also great and hints at what might have happened between Mal and Inara, if FOX hadn't dropped the ball. I never caught Dark Angel either but based on what a gem I found Firefly to be, I think I'll have to give that a try, too.Good special effects, a unique storyline set in a non-Trek future and this time Joss was in top form. I can't wait to get the DVD set to watch the episodes that never aired and I'm eager to see the big-screen version when Serenity opens.

Given how little it cost for this DVD, I felt I had to get it.  I don't feel this is Academy-award material by any means, but it is, as I said, ""very solid"".  The acting is good, the production is clean.  The sets and environments are interesting, and well-crafted.  The script walks the line between funny and serious.  It isn't a comedy, but there is camaraderie and joking, but also a willingness to explore serious topics and not pull punches in the process.  The characters are interesting and unique, and have an obvious chemistry.  It is definitely enjoyable.

FIREFLY doesn't deserve one hundred percent five-star ratings, guys. Okay? I mean REALLY. For one thing, the characters are still using shotguns five hundred years from now. How lame is that? Plus the series comes off as a kind of western oater with spacecraft. I mean, the guys on the show dress like nineteeth century cavalry troopers, with the riding boots, pants with the stripe up the side, and the suspenders, instead of 24th century types. And frankly some of the scenes look suspiciously like cheapo backlot studio sets rejected from grade B western flicks. (Hey, quit throwing rocks, you fanatics! Note that I give FIREFLY four-stars. OKAY?) Let me say I like this series because of its clever and witty dialogue, hot chicks and studley heros, and the relationships between the crew. (Will the captain ever confess his love for the ""whore""? Will the flight engineer and the doctor get together?) I like the ugly spaceship, Serenity, which looks like a giant june bug with rotating Harrier jet pods and a drop-down loading ramp. I like the characters, especially the foxy prositute and the business-only captain. These actors somehow should be in movies somewhere, they are that good looking and that talented, but for the life of me, I can't rememeber seeing them elsewhere. FIREFLY at times is pure western soap with shoot-outs on horse back and bar brawls, but, uh, WHO CARES? It's so well done. Elements have obviously been borrowed from ALIEN, BLADE RUNNER and western flicks, and at times it is both corny and sexy, but what really saves FIREFLY and propells it out among the stars is the writing and the acting.

Oddly enough, most Republicans claim to be Religious but watch Fox News which is owned, of course, by Fox. Incidentally, Fox makes some of the most Liberal films today. Something to hang your Hat on.Character development is very high and overpowers any action that may take place. The character played by Summer Glau however, has many plot holes and after 14 episodes, we still don't know much about her. This could have been one reason for cancellation as having a main character without any character development is a setup for failure. It's not really a series for those who require high amounts of action. You could think of Firefly as a Sci-Fi Western.Sometimes, Chinese is spoken as mostly nonsense curse words. Fox let this slip because the show was targeted at American audiences. That's probably insulting to a lot of Americans.

766596,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B0000AQS0F,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","All you have to do is look at the air dates on the back of the DVD cases to see how Fox royally screwed this show from the outset.  The episode that was meant to be the pilot, to set up the entire series, was not aired until the show was on the air for three months.  Even then it was not aired in its entirety.  Episodes were aired out of order so the story arcs did not flow, and as a result the story did not make as much sense.  All this ensured the series could never gain a foothold.  Anyone with any inkling of Joss Whedon's storytelling style on his other shows knows the way Fox handled this show was the death knell for it.It is sad that these 14 episodes and the movie Serenity are all that will ever be of these characters and the world the writers were trying to create.  It was a unique blend of sci-fi, space exploration, and wild-west shoot outs.  There were many characters all with unique stories that could never been fully explored.  Much like how Buffy started out, the cast was ensemble, with lesser known actors in the lead roles.  Nathan Fillion was probably the most recognizable actor as the series started, but even he was not a mega star.  All that said, because all of the actors were good and the writing was top notch, they pulled it off extremely well.The best way I can describe the show is a mix of Star Trek and Dukes of Hazzard (yet not as cheesy as the Dukes could be).  If you are a fan of Joss Whedon's other shows like Buffy, Angel and Dollhouse, or even watched Firefly when it was on the air but could never really get into it, get the series and see it as it was meant to be seen.  It was a unique show in which the good guys were not totally good, and the bad guys were not all bad.  There are a lot of shades of gray to the characters, and everyone has a sense of being in it for themselves.  If you have seen the movie Serenity and it did not make much sense, this will fill in the gaps and give you the back-story for the movie.

Not that my watching it when it was first broadcast 11 years ago would have saved it, but I certainly would have been one of the thousands of fans who wrote to the Fox Network and helped pay for trade industry ads in an attempt to save the show. Only just now have I watched the complete series--all 12 episodes of it--and I think it is one of the best shows in the history of television. It is witty, poignant, exciting, with a spaceship full of rich, fully realized characters played by a sterling cast. All the actors were so wonderful, in fact, that my favorite tended to be the one I was watching at the time.I like science fiction and love Westerns, and Joss Whedon's synthesis of the two genres went far beyond clever. In a mere handful of episodes, Whedon and his collaborators created a totally convincing fictional world, with consistent rules and very believable dangers. The ""Making Of"" documentary in this DVD set demonstrates amply the attachment the actors and crew had to the show, and to each other, as well as the disappointment bordering on abject grief they felt at the show's cancellation.I'm happy that most of ""Firefly's"" actors have gone on to success. But I'd much rather see Nathan Fillion as Malcolm Reynolds than as Richard Castle, and while I wouldn't give up Christina Hendricks as Joan Harris for anything, I will miss her as Saffron, the baddest bad girl in the galaxy. In any case, ""Firefly"" is a textbook example of a program that should have premiered on premium cable, where it would have had a chance for an audience to acclimate itself to the world of Mal Reynolds and his crew. At least I have the feature film ""Serenity"" to look forward to, and I can buy this DVD set, which I plan to do.

I had recently become a huge convert to the Buffy-verse, but was dubious about the premise of a ""space western.""  Silly me!  Once I'd watched and rewatched all my Buffy and Angel DVDs, I just had to have more Joss and turned in desperation to Firefly.  I was hooked less than halfway into the pilot movie and had to fight the urge to call in sick the next day so I could watch the whole series back-to-back.  I was so distressed when I got to the last episode, ""Objects in Space"", that I made myself go back and rewatch all the other episodes first so that I could savor the experience.  Imagine my delight when I got online and discovered that Joss and crew have already shot a feature film and that it will be out this spring!  Firefly lives!Now, about this premise.  The western thing took awhile to buy into, but stick with it and before long galloping horses and the abundant use of ""ain't"" get less jarring as all the pieces fall into place.  It all works for two reasons - the ensemble cast is amazing and the cinematography is breathtaking.  It is so evident that each and every member of the cast and crew was having the time of their lives working on this show because each element is so meticulously perfect.  I don't have the vocabularly to convey how very, very good the cast is.  This show wouldn't have worked without Nathan Fillion.  Dare I say it?  He almost makes me forget Captain Piccard.  Charisma, angst, comedy, passion - not to mention the good looks.  This boy has it all.  Gina Torres is a goddess, and Summer Gua gives a beautifully nuanced performance.  Adam Baldwin is masterful, and it's a delight to see Ron Glass again.All the episodes work, but expect a wide range of genres.  There's horror (""Bushwacked""), comedy (""Our Mrs. Reynolds""), classic sci fi (""Ariel""), even a study of existentialism (""Objects in Space"" - and thank you to Joss for explainging that in the commentary).  The only episode I wasn't crazy about was ""The Train Job"" which isn't surprising since it was the network's misguided pilot do-over.This DVD set is loaded with extra features.  Half of the episodes have commentary.  Joss himself chimes in on three, and several members of the cast participate as well.  It is so, so refreshing that the stars of the show participate both in the commentaries and the ""making of"" featurettes.  I only have one teeny complaint.  More a piece of advice than a complaint, really.  The title and individual episode menus don't indicate which episodes have commentary; you have to click on the ""language selection"" option to find the commentary.Words fail me.  I can't thank Joss Whedon enough for this masterpiece, and I am eternally grateful that he was so dedicated to the show that despite all obstacle he's made it into a feature film.  This is how much I love this show - I'm seriously considering buying a plane ticket from Armenia where I work to the States for the premiere of the film.  And I'm not even a sci fi geek!  Well, maybe a little.  I'd try to come up with more superlatives, but I must go order copies for all my family and friends.

I resisted watching these, the original description made the show sound like a rip-off of Han Solo.  So, I come to this show 4 years later and so sad it took this long.I watched 8 hours yesterday. Sometime during Disk 2 I got hooked. And as my interest grew, I noticed that the box said ""complete"" season, not ""first"" season.  I saved the last episode and the Serenity movie for tonight, so my firefly-topia isn't over yet.I didn't get it at first.  How can you mix Space Age technology with Gunslingers and the Old West?  As the series progresses, you come to realize the Old West type planets are the outlying settlements away from the ""Core"" as they call it.  Human colonies staking a hold on new planets, similar to the settlers migrating from mature European cities to colonize America.There is a strong bond of camaraderie among the small ship crew that is tested again and again.  The banter of dialog is appreciatively written for a grown-up perspective.  The lines delivered quick, spoken in tones and undertones suitable for the relationship perspectives given.  The dialog and acting are full of nuances and suggestions, raising the talent to a level that outshines its humble yet lovely theme song.The brother/sister characters, River and Simon(the doctor).  The madness of River, makes this relationship reminiscent of Hamlet.  Remember Ophelia?  Daisies for Remembrance.  They can be quite chilling together.The theme music can be haunting, setting up the mood for your transportation to the Firefly [uni]verse.This DVD collection really is a treasure for the collector.-Lara""i'm still free, you can't take the sky from me""",5,"i'm still free, you can't take the sky from me",1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,1714,"['had', 'decent', '42', 'birthday', 'yesterday', 'friend', 'sent', '4', 'disks', 'Firefly', 'resisted', 'watching', 'original', 'description', 'made', 'show', 'sound', 'rip-off', 'Han', 'Solo', 'So', 'come', 'show', '4', 'years', 'later', 'so', 'sad', 'took', 'long.I', 'watched', '8', 'hours', 'yesterday', 'Sometime', 'Disk', '2', 'got', 'hooked', 'interest', 'grew', 'noticed', 'box', 'said', 'complete', 'season', 'not', 'first', 'season', 'saved', 'last', 'episode', 'Serenity', 'movie', 'tonight', 'firefly-topia', ""n't"", 'yet.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'first', 'How', 'can', 'mix', 'Space', 'Age', 'technology', 'Gunslingers', 'Old', 'West', 'series', 'come', 'realize', 'Old', 'West', 'type', 'planets', 'are', 'outlying', 'settlements', 'away', 'Core', 'call', 'Human', 'staking', 'hold', 'new', 'planets', 'similar', 'settlers', 'migrating', 'mature', 'European', 'cities', 'colonize', 'America.There', 'strong', 'bond', 'camaraderie', 'small', 'ship', 'crew', 'tested', 'again', 'again', 'banter', 'dialog', 'appreciatively', 'written', 'grown-up', 'perspective', 'lines', 'delivered', 'quick', 'spoken', 'tones', 'undertones', 'suitable', 'relationship', 'given', 'dialog', 'acting', 'are', 'full', 'nuances', 'suggestions', 'raising', 'talent', 'level', 'humble', 'yet', 'lovely', 'theme', 'song.The', 'brother/sister', 'characters', 'River', 'Simon', 'doctor', 'madness', 'River', 'relationship', 'reminiscent', 'Hamlet', 'Remember', 'Ophelia', 'Daisies', 'Remembrance', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'chilling', 'together.The', 'theme', 'music', 'can', 'be', 'haunting', 'setting', 'up', 'mood', 'transportation', 'Firefly', '[', 'uni', ']', 'verse.This', 'DVD', 'collection', 'really', 'treasure', 'collector.-Lara', 'i', ""'m"", 'still', 'free', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'sky']",N/A
766604,A25AXWGBGJ5KBS,B0000AQS0F,"M J Heilbron Jr. ""Dr. Mo""","[17, 19]","Without an ounce of hyperbole, this show was the best thing on television in the last thirty years.Better than MASH, Hill Street Blues, Cheers, Seinfeld, Buffy, ST:TNG, Sopranos, West Wing...anything.Because this show takes ALL those shows...all the great aspects and beloved moments of those shows...and mixes them into an altogether original and completely satisfying entertainment.It's a little sci-fi show that has heavy Western (as in John Wayne, not as in hemisphere) elements, an elegant juxtaposition that brings the future and the past together in a way that makes is, funnily, remarkably current and fresh.The drama part of the show leans towards the romantic (like ""thirtysomething"") and the medical (like ""ER"").The action is more ""real"" and less ""lasers""...the science fiction part of the show is not about aliens or the ""weird"". It's about how in the future, people would either speak English or Chinese, both with equal facility. The fact that their cursing and other interjections are ""spontaneously"" in Chinese comes off hysterically funny. Plus it adds realism by avoiding ""bleeps"". The violence is not cartoonish at all.The cast, seriously, is a joy to behold. Nathan Fillion, as Captain Malcolm Reynolds, is a find. He brings a swashbuckling smart-ass quality as the group's leader. Adam Baldwin, as the swaggering, dim but aggressive Jayne, adds loutish humor to his well-played menace. Gina Torres, as First Mate Zoe, is a terrific character. Black, smart, beautiful, capable, loyal, intense and female. The type we need more of on television, whether you're paralyzed by political correctness or not.Zoe is married to Alan Tudyk's pilot Wash, who is the ""funny guy"" on the show, but his function is not only to be funny. The two of them add fun sexy moments to the ensemble.Sean Maher, as a young trauma surgeon (hooray!) and Summer Glau as his mysterious, odd sister River mix perfectly with the others. River's storyline adds a whole ""X-Files"" conspiracy thread, and having a surgeon on board allows for all sorts of medical crises that elevate suspense and tension. In the 14 episodes, everybody gets shot or stabbed at least once.Ron Glass, as the incredibly cool preacher, Shepherd Book, clearly has a past that is hinted about, but due to the cancellation, is never fully revealed. But his character allows for the entry of several theologic and religious ideas that broaden many of the plots in ways you could have never expected.Jewel Staite, as the adorable mechanic Kaylee, is an irresistible creation. Cute and sexy, fallible, vulnerable, but a whiz with the ship.And finally, Miss Baccarin as Inara. Is there any male out there who saw this show and didn't absolutely melt whenever she came on the screen? She's one of the most unexpectedly beautiful women I've ever seen. She plays a ""Companion""...a courtesan of sorts...who generates blinding sparks with the Captain.Palpable heat. Your TV set WILL get warmer.It's the classic situation...they can't fall in love, but you know they already have.The scripts are impossibly funny, unpredictable, exciting...never boring or routine. Whedon, Minear and friends lead you down a path that feels familiar, and suddenly, you're in a place you never considered. Blissfully.The acting is top-notch...THIS is the best ensemble cast of recent memory. Better than the West Wing. Better than the Sopranos.And I LOVE those shows...The special effects are nicely done, and the cinematography, in combination with the digital effects, adds startling immediacy to the proceedings. ""Hand held"" shaky shots of a landing spaceship? Things slightly out of frame. Fast zooms to a ship out in the atmosphere...it's a brilliant idea perfectly executed. It may be impossible to describe, but once you see it, you'll know what I'm trying to describe.After regretfully finishing the last episode, I found myself angry.I wanted more. I was disappointed with myself that I didn't support the show when it was on the air. I was disappointed that it was cancelled abruptly. I was angry that HBO or somebody didn't take it over......it goes without saying that I am now unbelievably excited for the movie this year, but had not been before seeing this show.My only hope is that enough people see the movie, to make some ignorant network bigwig thing, ""Hey...we should turn this into a TV show!""I love this show.",5,The best television show of the last 30 years.,1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,4364,"['ounce', 'hyperbole', 'show', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'television', 'last', 'thirty', 'years.Better', 'MASH', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'Cheers', 'Seinfeld', 'Buffy', 'ST', 'TNG', 'Sopranos', 'West', 'Wing', 'show', 'ALL', 'shows', 'great', 'aspects', 'beloved', 'moments', 'shows', 'mixes', 'altogether', 'original', 'completely', 'satisfying', 'entertainment.It', 'little', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'heavy', 'Western', 'John', 'Wayne', 'not', 'hemisphere', 'elements', 'elegant', 'juxtaposition', 'future', 'past', 'together', 'way', 'funnily', 'remarkably', 'current', 'fresh.The', 'drama', 'part', 'show', 'romantic', 'thirtysomething', 'medical', 'ER', '.The', 'action', 'more', 'real', 'less', 'lasers', 'science', 'fiction', 'part', 'show', 'not', 'aliens', 'weird', 'how', 'future', 'people', 'would', 'either', 'speak', 'English', 'Chinese', 'equal', 'facility', 'fact', 'cursing', 'other', 'interjections', 'are', 'spontaneously', 'Chinese', 'off', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'realism', 'avoiding', 'bleeps', 'violence', 'not', 'cartoonish', 'all.The', 'cast', 'seriously', 'joy', 'behold', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Captain', 'Malcolm', 'Reynolds', 'find', 'swashbuckling', 'smart-ass', 'quality', 'group', 'leader', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'swaggering', 'dim', 'aggressive', 'Jayne', 'loutish', 'humor', 'well-played', 'menace', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'First', 'Mate', 'Zoe', 'terrific', 'character', 'Black', 'smart', 'beautiful', 'capable', 'loyal', 'intense', 'female', 'type', 'need', 'more', 'television', ""'re"", 'paralyzed', 'political', 'correctness', 'not.Zoe', 'married', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'pilot', 'Wash', 'who', 'funny', 'guy', 'show', 'function', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'funny', 'two', 'add', 'fun', 'sexy', 'moments', 'ensemble.Sean', 'Maher', 'young', 'trauma', 'surgeon', 'hooray', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'mysterious', 'odd', 'sister', 'River', 'perfectly', 'others', 'River', 'storyline', 'whole', 'X-Files', 'conspiracy', 'thread', 'having', 'surgeon', 'board', 'sorts', 'medical', 'crises', 'elevate', 'suspense', 'tension', '14', 'episodes', 'everybody', 'shot', 'stabbed', 'least', 'once.Ron', 'Glass', 'incredibly', 'cool', 'preacher', 'Shepherd', 'Book', 'clearly', 'past', 'hinted', 'due', 'cancellation', 'never', 'fully', 'revealed', 'character', 'entry', 'several', 'theologic', 'religious', 'ideas', 'broaden', 'many', 'plots', 'ways', 'could', 'have', 'never', 'expected.Jewel', 'Staite', 'adorable', 'mechanic', 'Kaylee', 'irresistible', 'creation', 'Cute', 'sexy', 'fallible', 'vulnerable', 'whiz', 'ship.And', 'finally', 'Miss', 'Baccarin', 'Inara', 'there', 'male', 'who', 'saw', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'absolutely', 'melt', 'whenever', 'came', 'screen', 'one', 'most', 'unexpectedly', 'beautiful', 'women', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Companion', 'courtesan', 'sorts', 'who', 'blinding', 'sparks', 'Captain.Palpable', 'heat', 'TV', 'set', 'WILL', 'get', 'warmer.It', 'classic', 'situation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fall', 'love', 'know', 'already', 'have.The', 'scripts', 'are', 'impossibly', 'funny', 'unpredictable', 'exciting', 'never', 'boring', 'routine', 'Whedon', 'Minear', 'friends', 'lead', 'down', 'path', 'familiar', 'suddenly', ""'re"", 'place', 'never', 'considered', 'Blissfully.The', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'THIS', 'best', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'recent', 'memory', 'Better', 'West', 'Wing', 'Better', 'Sopranos.And', 'LOVE', 'shows', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'nicely', 'done', 'cinematography', 'combination', 'digital', 'effects', 'startling', 'immediacy', 'proceedings', 'Hand', 'held', 'shaky', 'shots', 'landing', 'spaceship', 'Things', 'slightly', 'frame', 'Fast', 'zooms', 'ship', 'out', 'atmosphere', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'may', 'be', 'impossible', 'describe', 'once', 'see', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'trying', 'describe.After', 'regretfully', 'finishing', 'last', 'episode', 'found', 'angry.I', 'wanted', 'more', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'support', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', 'cancelled', 'abruptly', 'was', 'angry', 'HBO', 'somebody', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'over', 'saying', 'am', 'now', 'unbelievably', 'excited', 'movie', 'year', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'before', 'seeing', 'show.My', 'only', 'hope', 'enough', 'people', 'see', 'movie', 'make', 'ignorant', 'network', 'bigwig', 'thing', 'Hey', 'should', 'turn', 'TV', 'show', 'love', 'show']",N/A

There are three episodes in this set that were never aired in the US, and it's such a joy and pleasure to be able to see them; I think they're some of the finest the series has to offer, and a clear indicator that if it had been allowed to progress, this show would've just gotten better and better.I really can't recommend this DVD set strongly enough.

766611,A1FH79YMHTZ2IK,B0000AQS0F,"M. Mealey ""Cinemama""","[42, 53]","For all those regular joes out there who can't possibly believe it's THAT good...It's not. But it IS good.I'll try my best to give a fair, balanced, honest, review.I did watch it's first run, missing a few episodes, here and there. I remember thinking it was only just okay, with potential to be better...Until I saw Objects in Space. With that episode I was convinced that this was something unique. In the end, I gave up watching because of the erratic program schedule.I ultimately saw the DVD this year, after seeing so many fansites still up and the news that this (Say what?!) is being made into a feature film...To be released in, no not TV, not direct to video, but in MOVIE THEATERS.First of all, if you dislike westerns, sci-fi, and quippy dialogue, stay FAR, FAR, away from this.For all of those who have never seen Firefly, and especially in light of recent Serenity screenings, you must ask yourself, ""What is it about this show that garners such an eusthusiastic cult audience? What is the deal here?""#1 It's the thoroughness with which the characters were written. There are many main characters, nine in all, and they are all completely rendered. There are no flat, clich&eacute;d, ""types"" here.One can tell, that had the series survived, these characters would have evolved and/or devolved in spectacularly interesting ways.#2 It's the thoroughness and uniqueness with which the world was concieved. There are details that make the series feel tangible, plausible, dirty even...Like good speculative fiction.No sound in space...No aliens...No ""lasers"" on the ship...A shot of Mal's tiny stainless steel toilet...Yes, a toilet was actually shown on primetime television.Fully-rendered worlds ALWAYS garner cult followings. Potter, Star Wars, and most famously, Star Trek are prime examples.The ship itself (the most important character on the show, hence the title) is small and submarine-like. This feels more plausible than deck afer deck of sleek corridors.The pristine, sterile, expansiveness of most other sci-fi series is not to be found with the heroes here.#3 Nobody's perfect. Everyone's got something going on. There's not one episode, where the characters are ""in the white""...They are always grey, sometimes dark grey.#4 The audience is trusted to have the attention span and patience to watch a multi-episode, multi-season character arc...Now, this could be a good thing or a bad thing for you.If Lost has already lost you, you may not want to see this. For me, however, I find it refreshing when writers trust their audience with pacing that's not for ten year-olds with a sugar-high.#5 For a TV series, the tone and action in most episodes is bleaker than average. It also explored some experimental non-linear directions...Objects in Space, Out of Gas, and War Stories, in particular, come to mind.Now, here are the aspects I think could more than likely turn off the casual viewer...#1 The eccentric dialogue a.k.a. western speak, country-western influenced music, and Chinese curses may be not be ""shiny"" (great), for everyone...#2 For the Star Wars-heads, Captain Mal Reynolds, the main hero, is quite similar to Han Solo...Or maybe that's a plus?#3 It's set in a future where eastern influences can be felt everywhere and yet... Full-blooded Asians are simply used as rare, background flourishes here and there.This is dissappointing and offensive for many Asians, whose Hollywood visibility, outside of Kung-Fu flicks, isn't exactly high to begin with...And here, the justifiable chance to use them in what could have been the first fully dimensional way on TV was squandered. And on Asian-infuenced show, no less.It must be mentioned, however, that many of the main actors are of mixed ethnicities...#4 With so many characters, there are bound to be a few who don't click for you...I like Mal (a cool M.F.), Kaylee (sweet and lovable, without inducing sugar-shock), and Jayne (funny without trying too hard to be). The actors portraying them do a particularly wonderful job.I don't really care for Simon (too lame/boring), River (too crazy), or Wash (too quippy).#5 And finally, the ""sci-fi western"" genre is not new. There have been quite a few other shows that have tread a similar path like Wild Wild West, Galaxy Rangers, Cowboy BeeBop, Brisco County Jr., and yes, even Star Trek...But then again, hospital shows aren't new either and there seem to be quite a few successful ones on TV.In other words, if you're looking for something COMPLETELY different, you won't find it here.I just want to reiterate that this isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread. It's simply an above average, high-quality, well-written, show that was cancelled before it got a fair chance.The episodes were aired on a Friday, out-of-order, with episodes pre-empted for weeks...I think Lost, for example, depending on where it's going, is a better show...And it's home network did a FAR BETTER job of promoting and nuturing it...Fox execs, do you see what happens when you actually believe in a good show?? Yup...I don't guarantee you'll like Firefly. I know a few folks who don't particularly care for it. But just rent this thing or borrow a friend's set and give it a try. It's worth a look.",4,A Balanced Review,1116028800,"05 14, 2005",2005,5215,"['regular', 'joes', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'believe', 'THAT', 'good', 'not', 'good.I', ""'ll"", 'try', 'best',

While working at Universal Studios, at their annual Halloween event, most of us spent our break times discussing our favorite 'scary' movies and other movies / t.v. shows. Now, I know that 'scary' is not really applicable to ""Firefly"", let alone ""Serenity"", but both the series and movie came up in conversation on more than just a couple of occasions. I had never heard of either one, let alone knew what either the series or movie were about (?). I must have kept those conversations in the back of my mind though ........Several months later the ""Firefly"" series aired on one of our cable stations, and remembering how many times this series came up during those Halloween night conversations, I decided to tape the series and check it out when I had the time. Well, that said, I was hooked right from the very first episode. This is unusual, considering that I'm not exactly what you would call an avid sci-fi fan. While I can't pinpoint the precise reason or reasons why I was hooked so quickly I can recall recognizing only one of the actors ~~ Nathan Fillion (whom I had seen in White Noise 2). While I had never heard of any of the other actors, I thought that the overall casting was a great effort. Some casts just ""gel"" while others don't; this one definitely did !!!! There's a bit of something for everyone - i.e. action, adventure, drama, romance and comedy. As for the basic plot of the series, it's certainly been rehashed in so many already posted reviews. So rather than rehash it again, I'm posting this as a newcomer to the ""Firefly"" series, as well as someone who hopes to convert more newcomers. Better late than never, I suppose ......If you like a good story, in the form of a mini-series, with the sci-fi aspect reminiscent of Star Wars ... in that it's not the type of sci-fi that is especially for the die hard sci-fi crowd, then you might want to give this series a chance. It seems the network / studio that aired the series back in 2002 didn't agree with my last statement, as the series was cancelled after only a few brief months. That said, the fans ~ known as ""Browncoats"" ~ refused to let the series just die and fade away .... much to the surprise and approval of the cast and creators, whom also thought the series had not been given a proper chance. IF I had known about ""Firefly"" back in the day I would certainly have been hooked when it originally aired. I have a feeling that a lack of knowing about this wonderful series (or perhaps a lack of publicity?) is why others probably also didn't know about it until recently. I am now a proud member of the ""Browncoat"" family and, thanks to syndication and DVDs, a happy owner of both the series and the follow-up feature film. It's a shame that so many GOOD shows die an early death due to premature cancellation, only to be upstaged by more and more idiotic reality shows. I want to thank all the ""Firefly"" fans for not letting this one get away ....",5,Wish I Would Have Known About This One !!!!,1379203200,"09 15, 2013",2013,3047,"['was', ""n't"", 'Halloween', 'season', 'last', 'year', '2012', 'first', 'found', 'out', 'Firefly', 'Serenity', 'working', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'annual', 'Halloween', 'event', 'most', 'spent', 'break', 'times', 'discussing', 'favorite', ""'scary"", 'movies', 'other', 'movies', '/', 't.v', 'shows', 'Now', 'know', ""'scary"", 'not', 'really', 'applicable', 'Firefly', 'let', 'alone', 'Serenity', 'series', 'movie', 'came', 'up', 'conversation', 'more', 'just', 'couple', 'occasions', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'one', 'let', 'alone', 'knew', 'what', 'series', 'movie', 'were', 'must', 'have', 'kept', 'conversations', 'back', 'mind', '..Several', 'months', 'later', 'Firefly', 'series', 'aired', 'one', 'cable', 'stations', 'remembering', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'series', 'came', 'up', 'Halloween', 'night', 'conversations', 'decided', 'tape', 'series', 'check', 'out', 'when', 'had', 'time', 'Well', 'said', 'was', 'hooked', 'right', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'unusual', 'considering', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'avid', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pinpoint', 'precise', 'reason', 'reasons', 'why', 'was', 'hooked', 'so', 'quickly', 'can', 'recall', 'recognizing', 'only', 'one', 'actors', '~~', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'whom', 'had', 'seen', 'White', 'Noise', '2', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'other', 'actors', 'thought', 'overall', 'casting', 'was', 'great', 'effort', 'casts', 'just', 'gel', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'one', 'definitely', 'did', 'bit', 'something', 'everyone', 'i.e', 'action', 'adventure', 'drama', 'romance', 'comedy', 'basic', 'plot', 'series', 'certainly', 'been', 'rehashed', 'so', 'many', 'already', 'posted', 'reviews', 'rather', 'rehash', 'again', ""'m"", 'posting', 'newcomer', 'Firefly', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'someone', 'who', 'convert', 'more', 'newcomers', 'Better', 'late', 'never', 'suppose', 'like', 'good', 'story', 'form', 'mini-series', 'sci-fi', 'aspect', 'reminiscent', 'Star', 'Wars', 'not', 'type', 'sci-fi', 'especially', 'die', 'hard', 'sci-fi', 'crowd', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'give', 'series', 'chance', 'network', '/', 'studio', 'aired', 'series', 'back', '2002', 'did', ""n't"", 'agree', 'last', 'statement', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', 'only', 'few', 'brief', 'months', 'said', 'fans', '~', 'known', 'Browncoats', '~', 'refused', 'let', 'series', 'just', 'die', 'fade', 'away', 'much', 'surprise', 'approval', 'cast', 'creators', 'whom', 'also', 'thought', 'series', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'given', 'proper', 'chance', 'IF', 'had', 'known', 'Firefly', 'back', 'day', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'been', 'hooked', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'have', 'feeling', 'lack', 'knowing', 'wonderful', 'series', 'perhaps', 'lack', 'publicity', 'why', 'others', 'probably', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'recently', 'am', 'now', 'proud', 'member', 'Browncoat', 'family', 'thanks', 'syndication', 'DVDs', 'happy', 'owner', 'series', 'follow-up', 'feature', 'film', 'shame', 'so', 'many', 'GOOD', 'shows', 'die', 'early', 'death', 'due', 'premature', 'cancellation', 'only', 'be', 'upstaged', 'more', 'more', 'idiotic', 'reality', 'shows', 'want', 'thank', 'Firefly', 'fans', 'not', 'letting', 'one', 'get', 'away']",N/A

Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[0, 0]","When you consider that the majority of people who watch this series, ends up loving it, it is a wonder that it was ever canceled.  But sadly it was, and this partially completed first season is all we have to enjoy (unless you count the movie that came later on).  But at least what we do have is entertaining.Firefly is the space cowboy series originally thought up by Joss Whedon.  Following the crew of a smuggling ship (or really whatever job they can get) it shows them trying to keep away from the central government.  Which proves tough to do with their line of work and the fugitives that they are transporting as well.  Add in Reavers (crazy space raiders) and not so friendly locals and space is just not a safe place.  But it's a place that feels like home to the spaceship Serenity and her crew.Characters:Nathan Fillion - Malcolm ReynoldsGina Torres - Zoe WashburneAlan Tudyke - Hoban WashburneMorena Baccarin - Inara SerraAdam Baldwin - Jayne CobbJewel Staite - Kaylee FryeSean Maher - Simon TamSummer Glau - River TamRon Glass - Derrial BookMal Reynolds is the captain of the Firefly ship and he's a no-nonsense but fair kind of guy.  He's also got a reasonable sense of humor and he's such a great leading character that you always want to find out what he's going to do next.  His first mate Zoe and her husband (the ship's pilot) are also interesting characters.  Although I think Zoe is a little too serious at times, especially when you compare her to her jovial husband.  One of my favorite characters is Kaylee, the mechanic of the ship, because she is so sweet and down to earth.  She really provides the ""nice"" that the crew of the ship needs.  Jayne, on the other hand, is the muscle and is somewhat dumb, but funny in that dumbness.  The Tam siblings provide some interest, but when it comes to being watchable, I find them the least enjoyable, but when it comes to that series, least enjoyable is still quite good.  Inara is the only one with legitimate work, but it's very interesting and I've seen her job likened to that of a geisha, which I think is pretty accurate.  The last main character, Book, is the preacher, but he has a lot of secrets.The whole space cowboy thing could have been very cheesy, but it's not.  Because of the depth of the characters, settings of the worlds, and the way the plot works, it is wholly original.  I loved that the crew didn't like the main government but had to learn to work within the confines and restrictions of their world(s).  The sets were very realistic and not overly showy.  Even the technology seemed not out-of-this-world and realistic.  And while there was a main plot that ran through the whole series, each episode was a good stand alone and had its own adventures.  Even the bad guys were pretty scary; a government that thinks it's doing good and evil space people that have gone mad.  Gives you a shudder just thinking about it.The special effects, for this being in its first season, were pretty good.  They used a lot of the same sets so they were able to really get it detailed.  The inside of the ship was well done.  I also really liked the music in the series as well.  It followed the country theme more, although there was some ballroom music.  The main theme song was great, lyrics and everything and kind of sets up the whole tone for the series.An excellent show that should have never been canceled.  It's one that I come back to time and time again.  I honestly love everything about it and can't personally find any flaws with it.Review by M.

FIREFLY, which aired on Fox, was not familiar to me as I had missed it when televised about a year ago. Ah, but when I started watching the DVD series, I was well rewarded with a purely pleasurable experience.The show was remarkably brilliant, with great humor throughout the series, and interesting new concepts included in this scifi space opera. Imagine a western set in space and one gets images of dusty frontier towns, low slung shooting irons, horses and saloon brawls, along with space ships and EVA suits, and that is just what Firefly delivers. It seemed to me like the story of Jesse James set 500 years in the future where the outlaws ride spaceships as well as horses, and space suits as well as dusters!The cast is excellent, headed up by Nathan Fillion as Capt. Malcolm 'Mal' Reynolds. The ensemble cast includes Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin (who is amazingly beautiful), Jewel Staite, Adam Baldwin (primary source of comic relief) Sean Maher, Summer Glau, and Ron Glass.And as avidly as I rave about the Firefly series, I think it is simply terrible!It is terrible that Fox dropped this excellent series, which was a breath of fresh air to those weary of lawyer shows, reality programs, cop shows and medical dramas! Firefly was new, inventive and clever.

Borrowing this set from a friend, I was skeptical, I had seen a trailer for Serenity, which looked like a bad, low budget Sci-Fi channel made for TV movie. Reading more about Serenity - it looks like it is just a push for DVD sales, though I believe they saved tons of money by using tv budget effects and actors.Easily the worst part of the show is the dialogue. Or wait, is it the actors? Or the mind numbing canned music? Or the painful intro song? Hard to choose. I'll say the dialogue since the last thing we need is a boring buffy western sci fi drenched in wittiness. Yes, everybody is very witty in this crew. You'll be up to your ears in wit, one-liners and creative sci-fi, techie speak. It was embarassing to watch. There was even an attempt at a western bar fight.

While ""Firefly"" certainly doesn't lack in geek appeal, its sharp writing, excellent cast and often-striking visual style elevate it into the ranks of Just Plain Great Television. After a somewhat bumpy start, this series found its groove with remarkable speed, and began cranking out hour after hour of compelling drama as if it had been on the air for years.The Fox network employed a novel strategy to introduce Firefly to audiences in the fall of 2002-- sidelining its brilliant two-hour premiere in favor of a dumbed-down and hastily-written successor, airing the series out of order (with all its least compelling episodes up front), and frequently pre-empting the show in favor of the world series. Fox then proceeded to throw up its hands in feigned amazement when the series tanked in the ratings. While fans of writer/producer/creator Joss Whedon do tend toward fanaticism, in this case it's more a testament to the quality and intelligence of ""Firefly"" that the series has enjoyed eye-popping pre-orders on DVD and new life as a feature film.Standout episodes include ""Serenity,"" the series' haunting, dryly funny pilot; ""Our Mrs. Reynolds,"" a sly mix of screwball comedy and crime caper; and ""Objects In Space,"" a nail-biting, beautifully shot game of cat and mouse between the series' most mysterious heroine and one of the more memorably whacked-out villains in recent TV memory.",4,"Top-notch television, grounded before its time.",1066089600,"10 14, 2003",2003,1528,"[""'re"", 'not', 'science', 'fiction', 'fan', 'may', 'be', 'looking', 'endless', 'string', 'rapturous', 'reviews', 'Firefly', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'Firefly', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'lack', 'geek', 'appeal', 'sharp', 'writing', 'excellent', 'cast', 'often-striking', 'visual', 'style', 'elevate', 'ranks', 'Just', 'Plain', 'Great', 'Television', 'somewhat', 'bumpy', 'start', 'series', 'found', 'groove', 'remarkable', 'speed', 'began', 'cranking', 'out', 'hour', 'hour', 'compelling', 'drama', 'had', 'been', 'air', 'years.The', 'Fox', 'network', 'employed', 'novel', 'strategy', 'introduce', 'Firefly', 'audiences', 'fall', '2002', 'sidelining', 'brilliant', 'two-hour', 'premiere', 'favor', 'dumbed-down', 'hastily-written', 'successor', 'airing', 'series', 'order', 'least', 'compelling', 'up', 'front', 'frequently', 'pre-empting', 'show', 'favor', 'world', 'series', 'Fox', 'then', 'proceeded', 'throw', 'up', 'hands', 'feigned', 'amazement', 'when', 'series', 'tanked', 'ratings', 'fans', 'writer/producer/creator', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'do', 'tend', 'fanaticism', 'case', 'more', 'testament', 'quality', 'intelligence', 'Firefly', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'eye-popping', 'pre-orders', 'DVD', 'new', 'life', 'feature', 'film.Standout', 'include', 'Serenity', 'series', 'haunting', 'dryly', 'funny', 'pilot', 'Mrs.', 'Reynolds', 'sly', 'mix', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'crime', 'caper', 'Objects', 'Space', 'nail-biting', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'series', 'most', 'mysterious', 'heroine', 'one', 'more', 'memorably', 'whacked-out', 'villains', 'recent', 'TV', 'memory']",N/A

Deciding to cancel this excellent, imaginative, well acted, intelligent, and decidedly awesome series smacks of the worst sort of incompetence at best, and heavy-handed draconian intolerance that The Alliance themselves would be proud of.What sets this show apart from virtually everything else currently on television is it's ability to create a powerful nostalgia for a time when living--and sometimes dying--free was an attainable reality.

I was glad to see that almost instantly I was rewarded for the risk on something I hadn't seen.After the pilot episode, which takes awhile to get going and almost chokes under the pressure of setting everything up, is over the show gets out for a bit of fresh air and really takes off. Nathon Fillion is amazing as Captain Mal Reynolds, and has the wit and charm of Whedon's writing down pat.The show is very humurous, and has a certain contagious charm. I found that I watched all 14 episodes in just a few days because the show is so addicting.

I was blown away. The precept was awesome, the characters were brilliant, the special effects innovative and beautiful, and the cast was brilliant (they worked extremely well together and had unreal chemistry).The story is about an ex-rebel and his friend from the war who own and operate a spaceship called Serenity. The rest of the crew is a varied set of drifters, refugees, and searchers. The show has a feel that is a combination old west and Sci-Fi. It sounds strange but it works beautifully.There are three episodes included in the set that were never aired and the commentaries and other bonus material is great. After watching my friend's copy I ran out the next day and bought my own copy, mostly because I loved the show but also to show my support in the form of money to the new movie and the possibility of reviving the series.There is hope. The DVD sales have been massive and massive DVD sales caused the pinheads at Fox to realize what they had had with ""Family Guy"", maybe the same thing will happen here.

766664,A1GJ175X2NMIE0,B0000AQS0F,"Oliasdoug ""Progressive Rock/Electronic New Ag...","[25, 27]","OK, here's how it all started for me. About a month ago in the Kansas City Star, I read a review of this interesting-looking movie I'd seen previews to called SERENITY. (""How cool to see a sci-fi movie with a title named after our ultimate goal in my N.A. group,"" I thought.) The guy reviewing the movie is GUSHING over it, admitting out loud it's hard for him to give a completely unbiased review of the movie, since he's a die-hard fan of the TV series it was based on. Up to this point, I'd only heard the title ""Firefly"" bandied about on occasion...seeing it in TV Guide, hearing the occasional reference to it in my chat room, etc. About the only TV I watch on a regular basis are the classic series that are found on both HBO and FX--the other channels held little if any interest for me. So, after reading the KC Star reviewer ranting about the Firefly series, implying it was the sci-fi equivalent of the Second Coming of Christ, I thought I'd put it on my Netflix list and check it out. I remember thinking, ""Well, if it's as good as STAR TREK and STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION, I'll be impressed.God, was I ever impressed.The TV series box set all arrived in the space of one week, and I ended up watching them all in the space of 4 days. I couldn't put one disc in and just watch one episode...I was fished in like a spawning trout and had to watch the entire thing, start to finish. Hooked, hooked, HOOKED. I loved everything about this show from the get-go. The cast: It was cool to see the familiar faces of Ron Glass and Adam Baldwin, but even cooler to get acquainted with the others who were unfamiliar to me. 9 very, very gifted actors who, for all intents & purposes, appeared BORN to play these roles. I could rant about them all individually, but I'd be sitting here for another hour. You get the message. The acting: Matter of opinion here, but I think they pulled it off effortlessly. They BECAME their characters in the fashion of true method actors. When actors make their jobs look completely natural and effortless, they are achieving their goals magna cum laude. The stories: They pull you in immediately, the same way Stephen King and others like him pull you in right from the first few pages instead of taking forever with plot set-up and character study. Some of the more cynical among us would argue that the stories got a bit corny on occasion. To that I would argue, hey, even the best sci-fi TV shows and movies would occasionally tread into that territory (I have yet to forgive the NEXT GENERATION series for coming up with the episode where Data tried to become a stand-up comedian with the help of Joe Piscopo...or in the original STAR TREK where they took on the group of outer-space ""hippies""...) Sometimes corniness can be the right kind of comic relief at the right time within a story; whether it works or not is subject to anyone's opinion. Personally, I don't think they ever crossed the line where that was concerned. The humor in the stories was a godsend, and the vast majority of the time, very well-done and thought out...and as I stated in my review of the movie, it was even more pronounced throughout the movie.I could go on about other nuances of the series that grabbed me or tell you about my favorite episodes, but after 1835 previous reviews of this series, you've gotten the message. Allow me to share this with you, though: After spending 4 days last week watching the series non-stop on DVD, I was chomping at the bit to go see the movie. I checked the newspapers to see if it was still showing anywhere here, since it had been playing for about a month at the time. Thankfully, it was still showing at ONE THEATRE quite a distance from where I live, and it goes without saying that it was worth the time, distance & $$ to get to see a truly fantastic movie. (Thank YOU, Joss.) It was the 7:30 showing that evening, and just imagine my surprise when I walked into the theatre to find it nearly PACKED. I thought I'd actually walked into the Friday night premiere of JARHEAD or something. Walked up to the top row, found a seat and asked the girl next to me if this was the theatre for SERENITY, & she said it was. No way in hell was I expecting to see that many people in the theatre that night, considering the movie was on its last run before (hopefully) hitting the dollar houses. Hard to describe the feeling that went through me as the lights went down and the movie started up...""corny"" as this might sound to some, there was a real feeling of camaraderie, of family...like I was part of a large group of like-minded people of greater-than-average intelligence who know quality when they see it. I'm sure I don't have to tell any of you by now what a rush the movie was, or how it's one of the few movies I've seen in recent memory that I would pay to see again.As has been stated by other reviewers, we can hope that the suits at Fox have learned a lesson by pulling the plug on a series that deserved to survive. (Can't help wondering if the FX network might learn a similar lesson now that I've heard that OVER THERE has been cancelled...) I'd like to believe that this series will be remembered for ages to come for its quality, its humor, its depth, its humanity. They don't make 'em like this anymore, and I feel blessed to be a part of the Firefly/Serenity community.",5,This series deserves 10 STARS (gorram it)...,1131235200,"11 6, 2005",2005,5344,"['OK',

The reason why we don't have anything new these past few years is apparently because of the low-ratings sci-fi television has been receiving. With 14 episodes produced, and only 11 aired, Firefly was cancelled by FOX in December 2002. However cult DVD box set followings (yeah this one) caused FOX to produce a movie version of the Firefly series called Serenity. Firefly is a cross between Star Wars and The Magnificent Seven. The shows creator, Josh Whedon (of Buffy the Vampire fame) had finished reading books about the Battle of Gettysburg and the American Civil War, combined the immigrant colonization elements with space pirates, a spice of Whedon whit in the script and a renegade crew on the ship Serenity with some state of the art special effects (Lucas could be forgiven for believing that his beloved ILM had been working early mornings without his knowledge) delivering on some cool stories for a show that deserves all the hype it has been receiving. In short if you own a DVD player, got the price for any box set, you will be getting value for content and then some more. This is like 10 hours worth of some of the best sci-fi you will ever see along with some of most hip characters to grace the television screen. The stories are all downright fab.

It's not as good as Sliders, the plots aren't as well written, and the way they explore a new planet in each episode is a very similar premise. I would go as far as to call it shamelessly derivitive.

766670,A30IUH4AC21ISL,B0000AQS0F,"Parrish A. Highley ""the_projectron""","[4, 4]","As a general rule, I avoid television like the plague.  Were one to write a two hour movie for television, it would necessarily appear in the format of a seven act play.  Would that be because the seven act play is the reference point for a quality plot structure?  No, it's because on commercial television your story is going to be interrupted six times for the purpose of selling corn flakes and underarm deoderant.  That compelling storytelling could come forth from such limitations should make anyone pause and appreciate what he or she seeing.  Such is the nature of Joss Whedon'sFirefly: The Complete Series [Blu-ray].The unifying premise of ""Firefly"" appears to have its roots in the American Civil War.  Having won a very similar war for very similar reasons decisively in the final battle in the Serenity Valley, The Alliance has forcibly united the whole of humanity.  The Captain of the firefly-class cargo ship, Malcolm Reynolds, was a separatist who fought on the losing side of said war, abandoned by his allies in that very last battle.  Unwilling to pledge his undying loyalty to The Alliance, he eeks out a meager existence smuggling contraband for hire or any other job he can manage to arrange with the shadowy figures with whom he is often forced to work.  Technological wonders do exist in this future vision of mankind but, as seems always the case, one must have the means to pay for such extravagance.When paying jobs become scarce, then Captain Malcolm Reynolds has to make due with ferrying passengers from one place to another.  Hence the growth of his crew aside from the core members to navigate, repair, or provide brute strength so the captain can get a little shut eye in relative peace.  In a lesser series, most of these characters would provide either plucky comic relief or function mostly as an archetype to bring the focus back onto the protagonist, but here every character is a protagonist, even the anti-hero Jayne Cobb who only barely qualifies as an anti-hero early on in the story arc.  The strength of this show is a great premise coupled with fantastic character development.It is a real shame that FOX could not find it in their cold-eyed bean counting hearts to let this run for a season or two, especially since Joss Whedon had already proved himself with two other successful series.  The filmSerenity [Blu-ray] was forced to tie every loose end of the unfinished series together in its somewhat rushed narrative.  While I do like the film, it should have been a trilogy given all the story arcs the series initiated.  If I had it to do all over again, I would film a trilogy that renders a definitive vision of the television series, but serves as a prequel to the film funded and distributed by Universal.  There were a lot of questions left unanswered by the series.  For instance, just how and why does Malcolm Reynolds lose his faith?  This is an interaction between Mal and the Shepherd that we never got to see, but should have.  Also, what if Inara chose men with whom she would not sleep out of a love for Mal?  The virgin she is hired to bed may have needed her kindness more than her body, why not explore THAT possibility?  But these questions linger primarily because the series never got the backing it both needed and deserved.  The untapped potential of this concept remains staggering!As a side note, the Blu-ray of the film is fantastic!  The series was intentionally filmed for a grainy look to coincide with the western genre, so that Blu-ray will hit the point of diminishing returns when those scenes appear.  I'll get the Blu-ray of the series just out of loyalty to the cast and crew, but it is not the stellar Blu-ray that the film is.",5,"If More Television Were Like This, I Might Bother to Actually Watch",1275091200,"05 29, 2010",2010,3712,"['general', 'rule', 'avoid', 'television', 'plague', 'Were', 'one', 'write', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'television', 'would', 'necessarily', 'appear', 'format', 'seven', 'act', 'play', 'Would', 'that', 'be', 'seven', 'act', 'play', 'reference', 'point', 'quality', 'plot', 'structure', 'No', 'because', 'commercial', 'television', 'story', 'going', 'be', 'interrupted', 'six', 'times', 'purpose', 'selling', 'corn', 'flakes', 'underarm', 'deoderant', 'compelling', 'storytelling', 'could', 'come', 'forth', 'such', 'limitations', 'should', 'make', 'anyone', 'pause', 'appreciate', 'what', 'seeing', 'Such', 'nature', 'Joss', ""Whedon'sFirefly"", 'Complete', 'Series', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', '.The', 'unifying', 'premise', 'Firefly', 'have', 'roots', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'Having', 'won', 'very', 'similar', 'war', 'very', 'similar', 'reasons', 'decisively', 'final', 'battle', 'Serenity', 'Valley', 'Alliance', 'forcibly', 'united', 'whole', 'humanity', 'Captain', 'firefly-class', 'cargo', 'ship', 'Malcolm', 'Reynolds', 'was', 'separatist', 'who', 'fought', 'losing', 'side', 'said', 'war', 'abandoned', 'allies', 'very', 'last', 'battle', 'Unwilling', 'pledge', 'undying', 'loyalty', 'Alliance', 'out', 'meager', 'existence', 'smuggling', 'contraband', 'hire', 'other', 'job', 'can', 'manage', 'arrange', 'shadowy', 'figures', 'whom', 'often', 'forced', 'work', 'Technological', 'wonders', 'do', 'exist', 'future', 'vision', 'mankind', 'always', 'case', 'one', 'must', 'have', 'means', 'pay', 'such', 'extravagance.When', 'paying', 'jobs', 'become', 'scarce', 'then', 'Captain', 'Malcolm', 'Reynolds', 'make', 'due', 'ferrying', 'passengers', 'one', 'place', 'Hence', 'growth', 'crew', 'aside', 'core', 'members', 'navigate', 'repair', 'provide', 'brute', 'strength', 'captain', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'shut', 'eye', 'relative', 'peace', 'lesser', 'series', 'most', 'characters', 'would', 'provide', 'plucky', 'comic', 'relief', 'function', 'mostly', 'archetype', 'bring', 'focus', 'back', 'protagonist', 'here', 'character', 'protagonist', 'even', 'anti-hero', 'Jayne', 'Cobb', 'who', 'only', 'barely', 'anti-hero', 'early', 'story', 'arc', 'strength', 'show', 'great', 'premise', 'coupled', 'fantastic', 'character', 'development.It', 'real', 'shame', 'FOX', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'cold-eyed', 'bean', 'counting', 'hearts', 'let', 'run', 'season', 'two', 'especially', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'had', 'already', 'proved', 'two', 'other', 'successful', 'series', 'filmSerenity', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'was', 'forced', 'tie', 'loose', 'end', 'unfinished', 'series', 'together', 'somewhat', 'rushed', 'narrative', 'do', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'trilogy', 'given', 'story', 'series', 'initiated', 'had', 'do', 'over', 'again', 'would', 'film', 'trilogy', 'definitive', 'vision', 'television', 'series', 'prequel', 'film', 'funded', 'distributed', 'Universal', 'were', 'lot', 'questions', 'left', 'unanswered', 'series', 'instance', 'just', 'how', 'why', 'Malcolm', 'Reynolds', 'lose', 'faith', 'interaction', 'Mal', 'Shepherd', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'should', 'have', 'Also', 'what', 'Inara', 'chose', 'men', 'whom', 'would', 'not', 'sleep', 'love', 'Mal', 'virgin', 'hired', 'bed', 'may', 'have', 'needed', 'kindness', 'more', 'body', 'why', 'not', 'explore', 'possibility', 'questions', 'linger', 'primarily', 'series', 'never', 'got', 'backing', 'needed', 'deserved', 'untapped', 'potential', 'concept', 'staggering', 'side', 'note', 'Blu-ray', 'film', 'fantastic', 'series', 'was', 'intentionally', 'filmed', 'grainy', 'look', 'coincide', 'western', 'genre', 'Blu-ray', 'will', 'hit', 'point', 'diminishing', 'returns', 'when', 'scenes', 'appear', ""'ll"", 'get', 'Blu-ray', 'series', 'just', 'loyalty', 'cast', 'crew', 'not', 'stellar', 'Blu-ray', 'film']",N/A

So, I didn't watch a single episode of it when Fox had it on the air, despite the good reviews and fan reaction it got.  Then, finally, it went away.  I stopped hearing about the show, and put it out of my mind.  I figured that if it got cancelled after one season, it wasn't worth it.

I heard so much good things, I just went online (to this fabulous site, nonetheless,) and bought it right out.  No renting, no borrowing, just bought it.  I'm glad I did.&quot;Firefly&quot; is one of the best shows I've ever seen, and even more evidence (although there is an abundance of this already,) that the execs at Fox all have some kind of mental problems when it comes to keeping perfectly good shows.  &quot;Firefly&quot; is, essentially, sci-fi (spaceships, space battles and the like,) combined very effectively with old western-type style (gunfights, dialogue, and just an overall visual style.)  It doesn't sound quite right on paper, but in motion it is a wonder to behold.  It kept bringing me back to my younger days, watching old cowboy movies with my Dad, and then yanking me back with some nice sci-fi type action.  It blends these elements beautifully, and never seems to trade one side for the other(i.e., not more sci-fi than western, or vice-versa) at any given moment.  The writing is some of the best I've seen, the special effects are worth of any movie (this means YOU, Lucas,) and the characters are well acted and well crafted.The only problem with this 4 disc set is that it really does leave you wanting more, and it's not the show's fault.  Fox needs to seriously reconsider bringing back the show, or at least giving the rights to someone else.  (Sci-Fi Channel, anyone?)  The set comes with some nice special features, including commentary on a few episodes, a gag reel, some deleted scenes, and some behind-the-scenes features that were made after the sad cancellation of the series, so everyone (cast and crew) has an opinion about it, which is kinda nice  to know.If you consider yourslef a fan of sci-fi, and are looking for something really unique, pick this up.  The way I see it, the more people buy this, the more money Fox gets to consider reintroducing the show.  Suddenly, that forty bucks seems to be going towards a good cause, doesn't it?  We can only dream, I suppose, but with a movie rumored to be in development and a possibility for someone like Sci-Fi Channel to pick up the show, sometimes dreams don't seem that far-fetched.",5,The executives at Fox suck... this show is great!,1075507200,"01 31, 2004",2004,2963,"['be', 'honest', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'quot', 'Firefly', 'quot', 'intended', 'ignore', 'Not', 'was', ""n't"", 'cool', 'concept', 'was', 'was', 'majority', 'advertisements', 'like', 'tended', 'focus', 'fact', 'show', 'was', 'created', 'same', 'guys', 'who', 'did', 'quot', 'Buffy', 'quot', 'quot', 'Angel.', 'quot', 'hated', 'shows', 'passion', 'So', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'single', 'episode', 'when', 'Fox', 'had', 'air', 'good', 'reviews', 'fan', 'reaction', 'got', 'Then', 'finally', 'went', 'away', 'stopped', 'hearing', 'show', 'put', 'mind', 'figured', 'got', 'cancelled', 'one', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'However', 'kept', 'hearing', 'angry', 'fans', 'writing', 'letters', 'even', 'raising', 'money', 'try', 'keep', 'show', 'air', 'Finally', 'gave', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'good', 'things', 'just', 'went', 'online', 'fabulous', 'site', 'nonetheless', 'bought', 'right', 'out', 'renting', 'borrowing', 'just', 'bought', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did.', 'quot', 'Firefly', 'quot', 'one', 'best', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'even', 'more', 'evidence', 'abundance', 'already', 'execs', 'Fox', 'have', 'kind', 'mental', 'problems', 'when', 'keeping', 'perfectly', 'good', 'shows', 'quot', 'Firefly', 'quot', 'essentially', 'sci-fi', 'spaceships', 'space', 'battles', 'like', 'combined', 'very', 'effectively', 'old', 'western-type', 'style', 'gunfights', 'dialogue', 'just', 'overall', 'visual', 'style', ""n't"", 'sound', 'quite', 'right', 'paper', 'motion', 'wonder', 'behold', 'kept', 'bringing', 'back', 'younger', 'days', 'watching', 'old', 'cowboy', 'movies', 'Dad', 'then', 'yanking', 'back', 'nice', 'sci-fi', 'type', 'action', 'elements', 'beautifully', 'never', 'trade', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'i.e.', 'not', 'more', 'sci-fi', 'western', 'vice-versa', 'given', 'moment', 'writing', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'worth', 'movie', 'YOU', 'Lucas', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'only', 'problem', '4', 'disc', 'set', 'really', 'leave', 'wanting', 'more', 'not', 'show', 'fault', 'Fox', 'seriously', 'reconsider', 'bringing', 'back', 'show', 'least', 'giving', 'rights', 'someone', 'else', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'anyone', 'set', 'nice', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'commentary', 'few', 'episodes', 'gag', 'reel', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'features', 'were', 'made', 'sad', 'cancellation', 'series', 'everyone', 'cast', 'crew', 'opinion', 'kinda', 'nice', 'know.If', 'consider', 'yourslef', 'fan', 'sci-fi', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'really', 'unique', 'pick', 'up', 'way', 'see', 'more', 'people', 'buy', 'more', 'money', 'Fox', 'consider', 'reintroducing', 'show', 'Suddenly', 'forty', 'bucks', 'be', 'going', 'good', 'cause', ""n't"", 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'suppose', 'movie', 'rumored', 'be', 'development', 'possibility', 'someone', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'pick', 'up', 'show', 'sometimes', 'dreams', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'far-fetched']",N/A

I put the DVD set in my Xbox 360 HDMI (TV recognized input as 1366x768 at 24 Hz) and put the Blu-ray set in my PS3 HDMI (TV recognized input as 1920x1080 at 120 Hz). A friend and I flipped back and forth between the two versions and saw maybe the absolute, most insignificant quality improvement on the Blu-ray side. Both of us had to convince ourselves that it was ""a little better."" It definitely wasn't a dramatic difference. The TV used was Samsung PN51D450 which is a plasma at 600 Hz with a native 1366x768 pixel field. No A/V receiver was used. If you have a TV that has a native pixel field with higher fidelity, then you may see a difference.Color, sound, etc. were all the same. No difference. One of the cameras used to film Firefly is always grainy. I never understood why that was, but during two camera shots, you can always pick out the grainy one, especially when the scene is very dark. Well, that effect, whether deliberate or not, is still present in the Blu-ray. CGI effects look identical; no molestation of the original content was made.I do enjoy the menu on the Blu-ray much better than the DVD. That sounds like an insignificant thing, but the DVD menu is horrible. I like being able to hit ""Play All"" and just walk away and let the audio of this fabulous show swell throughout the house, while I'm cleaning or whatnot. Can't do that with the DVD.Overall, if you have a functional DVD copy, I wouldn't rush out and drop $20 on the Blu-ray, and if you don't have a Blu-ray player, I wouldn't make Firefly your kill-app for one.Oh, and if you've never seen Firefly, you are missing out.

The cast of characters on the Firefly class star ship named Serenity have all been thrust into their predicament for different reasons, each hoping to achieve their own goals, but collectively most just wanting to stay a little further than the long-armed reach of the Alliance.  Relationships and friendships are formed, while they depend on each other to get them out of many different and exciting scrapes.The cinematography was progressive at the time, is still some of the best in the Sci-Fi genre, and holds up pretty well outside the genre.  For example, Joss Whedon, the creator and director, made a choice to use a shaky-cam for some of his shots, where the conventional wisdom of the day was to use a steady-cam; this added to the work-load of the CG-artists, but the effect gives a perfect perception of weight and action, and you can see the effect in popular use today in Sci-Fi movies like Star Trek: Into Darkness.The only bad thing I can say about the series is that it ended so early, due to some corporate decisions.  You end up caring about the characters, wondering if they make it.  Fortunately, Joss Whedon's crew and the fans were both persistent and dedicated enough to convince the powers that be to allow them to make a movie entitled, &#34;Serenity&#34; that wraps up many of the loose threads.  Make sure you watch the series, and then when you want more of this epic universe, watch the movie; it'll make much more sense, and you'll catch a lot of those little throw-backs to the series.&#34;No power in the 'verse can stop me.&#34; - River Tam",5,You can't stop the signal!,1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,1723,"['Firefly', 'glimpse', 'nitty-gritty', 'future', 'where', 'people', 'have', 'real', 'motivations', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'most', 'altruistic', 'person', 'can', 'be', 'cast', 'characters', 'Firefly', 'class', 'star', 'ship', 'named', 'Serenity', 'have', 'been', 'thrust', 'predicament', 'different', 'reasons', 'hoping', 'achieve', 'own', 'goals', 'collectively', 'most', 'just', 'wanting', 'stay', 'little', 'further', 'long-armed', 'reach', 'Alliance', 'Relationships', 'friendships', 'are', 'formed', 'depend', 'other', 'get', 'many', 'different', 'exciting', 'scrapes.The', 'cinematography', 'was', 'progressive', 'time', 'still', 'best', 'Sci-Fi', 'genre', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'genre', 'example', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'creator', 'director', 'made', 'choice', 'use', 'shaky-cam', 'shots', 'where', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'day', 'was', 'use', 'steady-cam', 'added', 'work-load', 'CG-artists', 'effect', 'perfect', 'perception', 'weight', 'action', 'can', 'see', 'effect', 'popular', 'use', 'today', 'Sci-Fi', 'movies', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness.The', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'series', 'ended', 'so', 'early', 'due', 'corporate', 'decisions', 'end', 'up', 'caring', 'characters', 'wondering', 'make', 'Fortunately', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'crew', 'fans', 'were', 'persistent', 'dedicated', 'enough', 'convince', 'powers', 'be', 'allow', 'make', 'movie', 'entitled', '34', 'Serenity', '34', 'wraps', 'up', 'many', 'loose', 'threads', 'Make', 'sure', 'watch', 'series', 'then', 'when', 'want', 'more', 'epic', 'universe', 'watch', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'make', 'much', 'more', 'sense', ""'ll"", 'catch', 'lot', 'little', 'throw-backs', 'series.', '34', 'power', ""'verse"", 'can', 'stop', 'me.', '34', 'River', 'Tam']",N/A

Firefly succeeds on so may levels that it is hard to define why it's great. I believe much of it has to do with the fact that the entire cast has talked about how much they loved doing this show together and it really shows.Firefly was a true ensemble piece that was driven by amazing characters and brilliant writing. They were characters, and settings that almost felt familiar but were unique enough to make you pay attention. It was Sci-fi for everyone not just ""geeks"" and ""nerds"". It was Sci-fi about people trying to survive and stay together, humans with flaws and potential and baggage trying to leave their past and work together to survive in a universe they don't quite fit into. No aliens, no time travel, just people, and still a deal of action.Most people know the story of how Fox TV screwed with this show in every way possible before finding an excuse to cancel it, and for this and other reasons Fox has vilified itself to a great many people. Despite Fox's shortsightedness Firefly has a fan base that is still growing as new people discover it. In just 14 episodes Firefly managed to do what most shows will never do, grab you and never let go. The true reason to mourn it's loss is potential. You have to wonder if in just 14 episodes it could be this great what could have happened if it had built a mythology and its character's had followed their natural growth.Their are groups still trying to get it back on the air or even a sequel to it's big screen finale ""Serenity"" made but sadly this will probably never happen but if anyone out there in the verse can ask Joss Whedon one thing, just one favor, ask him to at least let the universe be continued in novels, it has great potential to be a hit in the literary world especially since Firefly and Serenity's demographic is definitely one that reads.Stay Shiny",5,One of the reasons Joss Whedon is so loved.,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,1913,"['When', 'people', 'ask', 'favorite', 'TV', 'shows', 'always', 'first', 'mention', 'Firefly', 'so', 'may', 'levels', 'hard', 'define', 'why', 'great', 'believe', 'much', 'do', 'fact', 'entire', 'cast', 'talked', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'doing', 'show', 'together', 'really', 'shows.Firefly', 'was', 'true', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'was', 'driven', 'amazing', 'characters', 'brilliant', 'writing', 'were', 'characters', 'settings', 'almost', 'felt', 'familiar', 'were', 'unique', 'enough', 'make', 'pay', 'attention', 'was', 'Sci-fi', 'everyone', 'not', 'just', 'geeks', 'nerds', 'was', 'Sci-fi', 'people', 'trying', 'survive', 'stay', 'together', 'humans', 'flaws', 'potential', 'baggage', 'trying', 'leave', 'past', 'work', 'together', 'survive', 'universe', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'aliens', 'time', 'travel', 'just', 'people', 'still', 'deal', 'action.Most', 'people', 'know', 'story', 'how', 'Fox', 'TV', 'screwed', 'show', 'way', 'possible', 'finding', 'excuse', 'cancel', 'other', 'reasons', 'Fox', 'vilified', 'great', 'many', 'people', 'Fox', 'shortsightedness', 'Firefly', 'fan', 'base', 'still', 'growing', 'new', 'people', 'discover', 'just', '14', 'episodes', 'Firefly', 'managed', 'do', 'what', 'most', 'shows', 'will', 'never', 'do', 'grab', 'never', 'let', 'go', 'true', 'reason', 'mourn', 'loss', 'potential', 'have', 'wonder', 'just', '14', 'episodes', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'had', 'built', 'mythology', 'character', 'had', 'followed', 'natural', 'growth.Their', 'are', 'groups', 'still', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'air', 'even', 'sequel', 'big', 'screen', 'finale', 'Serenity', 'made', 'sadly', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'happen', 'anyone', 'there', 'verse', 'can', 'ask', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'one', 'thing', 'just', 'one', 'favor', 'ask', 'least', 'let', 'universe', 'be', 'continued', 'novels', 'great', 'potential', 'be', 'hit', 'literary', 'world', 'especially', 'Firefly', 'Serenity', 'demographic', 'definitely', 'one', 'Shiny']",N/A

Joss Whedon's Firefly series was abandoned by its network before completion, and ignored the developing fan base.  That population was strong enough to support and justify the development of the SERENITY movie, thanks to Joss, his backers, and their incredible team!

Joss tips his hat to Shakespeare, Homer, Chaucer, Plato, Socrates, Xiang Yu and other Eastern philosophers, in wit and rationale.  Each episode is a well-considered gem, sufficient to admire alone, but is best viewed in their intended sequence, as a graduated string of pearls from which to admire the pendant, and last to be appreciated, full length film: SERENITY.

Gene Roddenberry pitched ""Star Trek"" as Wagon Train to the Stars.  I think he would have recognized and enjoyed ""Firefly.""What makes ""Firefly"" a standout, in my humble opinion, is a combination of factors.In the first place, the ensemble cast is nothing short of superb.  In fact, I'm a little annoyed with Mr. Whedon for killing off Wash and the Preacher in the ""Serenity"" full-length film.  However, here in the series, you can enjoy the whole bunch, each of whom contributes largely and directly to the success of this series.Second, the writing is really good.  You hear a lot about good writing, often in relation to indifferent work like ""The Sopranos.""  In this case, the accolade is deserved.  The writers give us some wit and some serious interaction along with each story.  You don't get that paint by the numbers feeling often, if at all.Third, the production values are top.  Remember, Roddenberry fussed over the design of the Enterprise, even though the network suits told him, ""Take a cigar shape, put some windows on it, end of case.""  The Serenity looks real, both inside and out.  The crew accepts and appreciates their ship (mechanic Kaylee maybe edging into Scotty-like obsession), but is always realistic about its shortcomings.OK, some hardcore hard-science fans may find aspects simplistic.  ""Star Trek"" stuck to 'Class M planets.'  In the ""Firefly"" universe, the habitable worlds have been terraformed.  So what?And as far as not having aliens, (a) see 'terraformed' above, and (b) the homicidal Reavers are alien enough.Like ""Star Trek"", ""Firefly"" the series was pushed off stage by a neglectful network that didn't recognize quality when they had it.  Like ""Star Trek"", ""Firefly""'s fans pushed hard enough to get a full-length motion picture.

766695,A3BSRAFXWY7COC,B0000AQS0F,Pete,"[4, 5]","Over 1200 reviews, most with positive feedback. Joss Whedon. And the fact that the film, Serenity, will be out in November this year.This is evidence that this show is so damn good. I'm such a fan of it!No, it's not like Buffy. I'm glad for this-it would've paled in comparison. This is a show that can't be compared. It's a different kettle of fish. The only comparison buffy shares with firefly is creator, Joss Whedon's notion of the importance of the created family. And that's a good theme to run with.Being a buffy fan I bought the dvds on a risk. I'd only read one review (which gave it three stars because it ""isn't enough like Buffy""). The show didn't air in australia until months after the dvds were released (and it was treated as badly as Fox here too - with timeslots ranging from 11.30pm-1.30am at night once every three weeks with inconsistent changes) so I bought em as soon as I could. I'm so glad I did. I lent the dvds to a friend and one disc came back cracked so I bought it again and it's a good thing I did cause I still watch the episodes a lot.When I first sat down to Firefly I liked it but wasn't sure if I'd love it. It was quite fast and I missed a lot of dialogue. But by the end of the pilot I was hooked and watched the entire season in one sitting (missing all my classes I had at uni that day).The fans seem few and far between but this show has a strong cult following. There's more of us around that I thought. One day I was talking to a friend about firefly and a complete stranger from Canada overheard me and told us she thought the show was excellent.I'm excited to see the film. The official release date is September 29th but you can probably catch an advanced screening, if it's not sold out.It's not necessary but worth checking out the series first. So make sure you persist through the speedy start cause it's very rewarding.

Being a Science Fiction and Fantasy fan, I promptly ordered it because if I hated it I could obviously get rid of it pretty easily.  Since then, I've re-sold or traded the vast majority of the DVDs that I've purchased over the years but Firefly (and its full length companion film ""Serenity"") still occupies a permanent place in my private collection.

That's a first!Seems that I wasn't the only person who missed this fabulous series when it was part of the Fox lineup.  Created by Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) it enjoys an original premise, extremely smart writing and a cast of talented regulars with great chemistry.  Given the boot after only 14 episodes (some of which were never aired as part of the original series) by some brainiac executive at Fox, it lives on in perpetuity as a cult classic.

Little did I know this episode wasn't the pilot, which did a great job of easing viewers into the universe. Little did I know Fox showed the pilot just before cancelling the show, effectively screwing any continuity they could've built for viewers.

I run a 52"" 1080 TV and therefore I'd presumed the SD clips would stand out like the proverbial sore thumb but no ... they integrate quite well.

I love science fiction, I grew up on Westerns, so the combination sounded interesting and I ordered.  Now I'm hooked.  This series is superb.  It has good character development, a good premise (a rough-and-tumble space frontier 500 years in the future) and succeeds very well in combining the action and style of a Western with survival on an old ship in outer space.  The premise -- a band of renegades struggling to survive while avoiding the oppressive new Alliance government -- makes for good conflict, along with cannibalistic Reavers and gangs of nefarious bad guys.  (Sure, the Serenity crew are a bunch of outlaws, but they are really the good guys.)  The design of the ""Firefly class"" ship is very creative, too -- it does resemble a firefly when the engines light up the stern, which gave me my ""aha!"" moment as to why a science fiction series would be named after a bug.  My only complaint about ""Firefly"" is that there wasn't enough of it.  Fox really blew it when they canceled this before the end of the first season!

766740,A1AF8GGNQ6LTBK,B0000AQS0F,Revelation Magazine,"[4, 4]","What can be said about Firefly that has not been said already? Joss Whedon's short-lived science fiction series seizes the most successful qualities from a half-dozen distinctive genres and recombines them to create an inventive episodic drama that is nothing short of brilliant. The post-apocalyptic spaceways traveled by the Serenity and her diverse crew--with ""Earth-That-Was"" left far behind--contain an inspired melding of cultures, lifestyles, personalities, and ideas. Whedon has crafted a unique and unforgettable universe, one that is so believable and engaging that it seems comforting and instantly familiar. There may be something for everyone in this DVD collection. Firefly's highflying adventures are much more than standard space opera. The show's amusing, emotional, and sometimes contemplative stories call upon viewers not only to look to the future of mankind but also to re-examine our shared past, to consider history and heritage in meaningful new ways. The series is almost always believable, thanks in part to some impressive production values. The visual effects, sets, costumes, direction, and music are perfectly executed. More importantly, both the cast and the show's sharp scripts are superb. Firefly is endlessly amusing, it's true, and damned witty too. What's most involving about the show, however, is its undeniable heart. As they laugh and cry together you can see that it would be difficult to watch these episodes without becoming emotionally attached to such a charismatic cast. The only unfortunate aspect of this collection is that it contains so few installments; truly, it's a crime the series was brought to such an early end. Firefly encapsulates the excitement and adventure of science fiction, the soul and humor of a character-driven drama, and all of the down-to-earth charms of a traditional western. Ultimately, however, like all great works of art, the series is much more than the sum of its parts.

When my friends spoke highly of the canceled show 'Firefly', I refused to see it. I thought it was a rip-off of the anime 'Outlaw Star' when I saw the commercial with River in the box (Melfina, the android of the anime, also was found curled up in a similar box). But then one friend really made my ears perk up. One of my favorite actresses, Jewel Staite, was one of the nine main characters on the show! I chuckled at that because I first fell in love with her when she played Catalina on 'Space Cases' which Billy Mummy also helped create and Catalina was an engineering genius, much like Kaylee which Jewel plays wonderfully in 'Firefly'.When I bought the boxset, my heart was troubled. What was I thinking?! I hate sci-fi shows! But it was all for Jewel, I reminded myself. Lo-and-behold, 'Firefly' is now my favorite show on Earth! I need more!!! *Twitches* It has enjoyable characters, lots of humor, drama, a little dash of sex and violence plus a plot line that can be followed pretty easily! All the characters are well-played and I was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked the main character (usually I like one of the minor characters more then the boring hero seen in many different shows) and understood his struggles with himself, his past and his faith. I was also very surprised at how cheery Jewel's character was. She usually plays the stubborn but nice girls who sometimes turn their noses up at the world. I also liked how the writers made us like Kaylee in the first episode right away before she was...well, you have to find out!If you like space drama/action adventures, don't hesitate to buy it. If you don't, I say buy it when you get some extra cash like I did. Believe me, you won't regret it!I can't wait until the movie comes out...

Then I watched Serenity, and found it to be a great film with very strong characters-which is the most important factor in a good story anyway.Naturally when I found out that Serenity basically was the epilogue of Firefly, I just had to see Firefly.  It was like watching 14 more one hour movies of Serenity!  Or perhaps Serenity is just Firefly #15?  What makes Firefly special to me is that all the episodes have a very, very strong story and a consistency that you simply don't find in Babylon 5 or the first two Star Trek shows (TOS, TNG).  I'm not talking characters referening previous episodes here either-it's simply the intensity and quality of the writing that is noteworthy.  With other TV shows, you typically get some or a lot of good stories during a season intermixed by some average and maybe even a bad episode (see Grey 17 Is Missing from Bablyon 5 for example), but never all of the episodes are good.  Firefly is the exception here.While the chances of Firefly being resurrected are quasi-null, I hope more Serenity films are made and I'd like to see Mal admit he has feelings for Inara-to her, that is, before Joss Whedon decides to actually, formally end this great sci-fi show (supposedly a Serenity Trilogy could happen based on various interviews with the cast and crew).  The unresolved romantic tension is exciting, but killing me at the same time...Mal seems harder, and colder, in Serenity than he does in Firefly, but that seemed like the only change I found as far as character behavior goes.This is a show-and a movie (Serenity), not to be underestimated.

(I enjoyed maybe 4 epsiodes total of each.)FIREFLY, I never saw at all when it WAS being aired on t.v. Agian I say, this is an amazingling well created series. The detail, and originality of this show caught me off gaurd. Without employing so many of the sci-fi cliches... this show accomplishes a level of greatness. It brings a fresh look to the sci-fi genre infusing the ideas of a frontier style attiude. I am aware that sci-fi and 'western' storylines have been fused together in previous attempts, this is the most seamless version of the idea, that I have seen.I am a science fiction genre fan, and this is a welcome, and valuable addition to my collection. Get your copy now!As many know by now there will be a feature length film released soon, and as one contributor to the series said... we can only hope that someone will go...""why haven't we made a t.v. show out of this, and then SERENITY will be resurrected.

In my humble opinion, television programming is dead (there are some exceptions). The trash the networks spout out these days seems to be nothing more than crude, rude, mindless ""entertainment"" (again, there are a few exceptions).A friend of mine recommended Firefly when it was first released on DVD. I was hesitant. I had tried other ""popular"" sci-fi shows on TV and I came away disappointed every time. I realize that many of these shows have a large fan base and I mean no disrespect to these people, but I just felt that these shows were garbage.Well, I finally rented disc one of the Firefly DVD set. After watching the first disc, I immediately returned it and didn't bother renting the second one. I simply ordered the entire boxed set.This is a thoughful, intelligent, entertaining, and character-driven show. The special effects are very good, the casting is superb, the dialougue is witty and intelligent, the stories are unique and fun, and even the costumes are brilliantly conceived!I instantly fell in love with the crew of Serenity and eagerly looked forward to each episode.This is a brilliant show!So, what does that mean?Well, the network executives will have to cancel it, of course!Yes, the series did suffer from low ratings, but after doing a bit of research, I found out that the network insisted on airing the episodes out of order. This lead to viewers not fully understanding what was going on since they were not aware of some of the ""back story"" and previous events that had happened to the characters.Well, that's a network executive all over; paid a rediculous salary to make really bad decisions for the general public. Where can I sign up for a job like that? (just kidding; I would never stoop so low).The DVD sales of the Firefly series speak for themselves. Had this show really been given a chance, it would still be on the air today regularly pulling in a sizable portion of ratings and the executives I bad-mouthed a moment ago would be lining their pockets with oodles of cash.....BUT AT LEAST THE VIEWING PUBLIC WOULD BE HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If you like sci-fi, PLEASE check this show out. You will NOT be disappointed. The show itself is great, but so are the extra features (the gag reel is HILARIOUS!).If you LOVE sci-fi, just spend the money on the boxed set now and don't bother renting.

Watching the ""extras"" on the last disc reveals even more. Just imagine how good this would be without the constant tweaking demanded by the network pinheads at Fox! Joss Whedon tells about the changes the network was always pushing for with the show and despite his efforts to appease them, they cancel it anyway. How come all the good shows die young? About a decade ago, about the only show I would watch on TV was the wonderfully entertaining Brisco County, Jr. (also quickly cancelled by Fox). Like Firefly, it had stand alone episodes, but a steadily advancing plot with reoccurring characters, and was marvelous.

766770,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B0000AQS0F,Robert Badgley,"[3, 3]","Well,I may have missed the initial party,but it's never too late to become a Browncoat.I am proudly displaying my Browncoat beside the suits of The Federation,Earth Alliance and the Commonwealth(I will let you savvy TV Sci Fi fans figure out which show belongs to what suit!).This Joss Whedon treasure is as surefire winner,from the brilliant writing to the direction to the wonderful ensemble cast,as any of the aforementioned shows were.The only difference between those and this show is this one was cut off in its prime.After only 11 eps(including the 2 hour pilot) the show faded to black.Three shows were filmed and left unaired,but have thankfully found a home in this set.Star Trek was originally compared to being a Wagon Train-like show set in the future.Well Firefly takes the Wagon Train element and brings it more literally to life than Star trek ever did.There are horses,wagons,six shooters,rifles,cattle,cowboys;all the things a good western needs and more.The shows premise harkens back to the US Civil War where the Union fought the Confederacy,here referred to as the Alliance against the Independents.The lead characters consider themselves all members of the latter.The Firefly class ship(it actually is reminiscent of said insect)is called Serenity,so named after the famous battle of Serenity Valley which two of the lead characters fought through and barely survived.It was the battle that ended the war between the two factions.The ship and crew now do odd jobs for odd characters,going where the pay takes them and generally trying to steer clear of the Alliance.What sets this Sci Fi series apart from its competitors is the decided lack of aliens.This series focuses more on the human factor;that is our own progression out into the galaxy and our colonization of it.Goodness knows there is enough writing fodder to be had concentrating solely on humans,without having to add the alien dynamic into the mix.And Joss Whedon successfully does just that.The cast was a dream cast.Everything gelled perfectly.They were:Nathan Fillion as Malcolm Reynolds,Gina Torres as Zoe,Alan Tudyk as Wash,Morena Baccarin as Innara,Adam Baldwin as Jayne,Jewel Staite as Kaylee,Sean Maher as the Dr Tam,Summer Glau as River and finally Ron Glass as Book.Glass is well known from Barney Miller and Gina Torres is one of my fave kick butt-type characters from Xena,Hercules and Cleopatra 2020.The characters were brought vividly to life by each actor,and each had their own back story to tell,which fleshed out the entire feel of the show.The entire set of eps in this DVD set are in w/s format,clear and crisp for the most part,and there are oodles of extras for all those dedicated Browncoats out there such as:a featurette on the making of the series,the ship,deleted scenes,a gag reel,and more.I never saw the original series in its original airing(the only one out of the aforementioned others-if you have successfully guessed by now which ones they are-I didn't).But I heard alot about it and its' premature demise.The first thing I ever saw of Firefly was the movie Serenity(see my review on that)and loved it.I did not know then about the back story but now having viewed the original series,it all comes beautifully into focus.This set of four single sided discs is da bomb,believe me.This series will show you what intelligent TV writing can do and Whedon is to commended for his vision on this project.Whedon killed off some of the shows characters in the movie but there is no reason a renewed series couldn't just pick up where the original left off,with all the same people and have the movie as the final fade out of the series once it is done.But that takes vision and guts on the part of TV execs,which unfortunately is sadly lacking when they see shows that don't neatly fit within their prescribed parameters.Well,the ever swelling ranks of Browncoats just added one more enthusiastic member.I urge you to buy this set and guarantee after you watch it,you will be joining up too!",5,Am I too late for the party?,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,4005,"['Well', 'may', 'have', 'missed',

766774,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0000AQS0F,Robert Moore,"[27, 36]","If one ever had cause to doubt the wisdom of those in charge at FOX and are unfamiliar with the absurdly short-lived series FIREFLY, just watch these CDs and have your worst fears confirmed.  There seems to be an ongoing and massive disconnect between what is great on TV and what is fopped off to the public in primetime.  FIREFLY never really got a chance, though based on the few episodes that made it onto the airways, it most probably was going to go down as the finest Sci-fi series since STAR TREK: NEXT GENERATION.  It had a depth and complexity and potential for development that never really got developed.  One can only speculate about how good the series would have gotten, but some idea might be derived by considering producer Joss Whedon's two other series:  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and ANGEL.  Neither of those shows, as great as they were, was especially great in their first season.  BUFFY was short budgeted, and Whedon was still learning how to make a TV series after a lifetime of working strictly as a writer.  ANGEL was trying to find its own identify after breaking Angel, Cordelia, and Wesley out of Sunnydale, but by the second season it managed to find its own magnificent, if quite dark, identity.  FIREFLY was excellent from the get-go, but how much better might it have become had Whedon and Tim Minear had time to develop it?Nearly everything about this series stands out.  The special effects are without much competition the most outstanding I have ever seen on TV, most of it the result of CGI scripting rather than modeling, though models are used as well.  Just how spectacular the effects could be could be seen early on, in the episode ""The Train.""  The Serenity, the space freighter used by the show's protagonists, soars down over a hyper speed freight train and hovers over it while one of the crew is lowered on a rope to one of the cars, where two other crewmembers have extracted cargo for the purposes of theft.  The sequence is simply stunning, even by feature film standards.  Luckily, there is more to FIREFLY than special effects.  One can't conceive a Joss Whedon show without great writing and a complete eschewal of the hackneyed and stereotypical.  Whedon is the finest chain puller in the history of TV writing, and just when you think a show is becoming predictable, the entire storyline will shift into completely original and sometimes shocking terrain.  Whedon is also a master at both short and long-range story arcs, and thanks to the brain trust at FOX, we didn't get to experience the long-range story arcs.The cast is absolutely first rate, and one of the great tragedies in the show ending as quickly as it did was losing the opportunity to get to know these folks better.  Just as the relations between the cast members were getting really interesting (another hallmark of a Whedon production), FOX pulled the plug.  Nathan Fillion showed that he had the presence to be a charismatic lead character as Captain Mal Reynolds, former fighter against the federation on the side of the Independents, now a rogue who takes on all kinds of odd jobs, as long as it never hurts everyday folk.  Gina Torres is a familiar face from movies like THE MATRIX RELOADED and guesting on TV shows like ANGEL, HERCULES, and ALIAS, and was great here as the ship's number two, with Alan Tudyk playing her slightly under-her-thumb (in a cute way) husband and ship pilot.  Adam Baldwin is great as Cobb, the ship's resident tough guy and muscle.  The incredibly stunning Marena Baccarin plays Inara Serra, a registered Companion (i.e., a very high-class prostitute along the lines of accomplished, educated, sophisticated courtesans) who is clearly in love with Reynolds despite her coolness.  Her role is remarkable in that she is not portrayed as being at all sleazy.  In fact, she is the ship's most respected passenger, being treated with inordinate deference wherever they travel.  Jewel Staite is Kaylee, the ship's mechanic, and Ron Glass the ship's chaplain.  He describes his role as that of giving guidance in an area where things are often confused and lacking in moral order.  Finally, the crew is rounded out by Sean Maher, who plays the ship's doctor, and Summer Glau, who plays his mysteriously gifted sister River, who is desperately sought by the Alliance.  Clearly River was the character who would have caused some of the most interesting plot developments had the series continued.Fans of FIREFLY have had in recent months two great pieces of good news.  The first is that not only the episodes originally shown on FOX will be shown on these DVDs, but three previously unseen episodes.  The latter along would justify the cost of the discs.  But recently we have had what is potentially an even greater piece of news:  Joss Whedon's next major project is going to be a full length feature film of FIREFLY, and he hopes to bring the entire cast of the TV show into the film.  Of course, this creates fantasies of the show being revived on a different television network.  But at the very least, it means that we have the DVDs of this great, great series and a forthcoming film to help us over our hurt.",5,Monument to one of the FOX's worst decisions ever,1064102400,"09

Add to that one of the best ensemble casts since ""Hill Street Blues"" (Note: when is that show going to make it to DVD??) and you have a really terrific series.

It seamlessly blends Western and Science Fiction elements into one cohesive whole, adding into the mix deep characters and more wit than your average sitcom - in an hour long drama series.One of the problems leading to its demise was the difficulty of marketing such a show; most who enjoy Westerns do not enjoy Science Fiction, and vice-versa.  But in this case, it just works, for both parties.  It's a shame neither gave it enough of the chance for it to survive FOX's mishandling of the series.But now we have the DVD set.  All 14 episodes including those never aired are contained within this package.  Not only that, but this set is cram-packed with enough special features to last you almost as long as the episodes themselves.  With this and a full theatrical motion picture on the horizon, Firefly is far from over.And even if you're not a fan of the show, now is the time to give it a try.  It was, plain and simple, one of the best shows aired on TV in recent times.  It, in this reviewer's humble opinion, surpassed even Joss Whedon's other creations, with higher believability, better characters, and wittier dialogue.  The dialogue, in fact, has not yet been matched by any show I have ever seen - and I've seen a few.If you're a Firefly fan, buy this box set.

When I see the mindless junk on TV today, it seems insane for Fox to have treated Joss Whedon's Firefly the way they did. It seems that the Fox executive who made the decision to reject the original pilot, show the episodes out of order, and then cancel the series was a Hwoon dahn. Firefly has grown to be unstoppable. The show is simply awesome. After watching the last episode on the fourth disc, I wanted more. I now have this empty space in me that only more of the Firefly verse can fill. This show could easily have made 7 seasons worth of great episodes. Fans of Firefly see the awesome potential that this show had and still has.

766804,A1RC7W0ZHJIJZW,B0000AQS0F,R. Sundquist,"[22, 50]","I've given it some thought, and after rewatching the pilot episode recently I've decided exactly what it is that I dislike about this show. Apparently it's a hugely popular show, despite only lasting for a single short season, and I think it's necessary to provide a counterpoint to all the glowing reviews hailing it as the best show ever.First, genre. ""Firefly"" is squarely an action-adventure series. Despite being set in the future, there is nothing particularly futuristic about any of the technology. There is also very little science fiction besides the arbitrary inclusion of a spaceship. Conflicts are generally resolved with gunfights, and the main ship itself is so comfy that one never really gets the idea that the crew are living in it. This approach avoids both the technical/scientific tropes common to the SF genre (time travel, aliens, black holes, etc) as well as the character-driven conflicts of mainstream drama (to which one can add ""Battlestar Galactica"", essentially a drama in space). Instead, ""Firefly"" is a Western, wholly content to live by the restrictions of that genre. Replace the spaceship with a riverboat, covered wagon, or Winnebago, and you'd have basically the same result. If there's no good reason for it to be set in space, then it shouldn't be set in space.Second, characters. Joss Whedon created and wrote the classic ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer"", a clever genre show about teenagers. Perhaps it's because he's so accustomed to writing for teenagers that he doesn't really know how to write for adults, and as a result none of the characters in ""Firefly"" act their age. The relationships among the cast, as well as their behavior and emotions, are all appropriate for teenagers, who are no doubt the target audience. They tend to be selfish, sulky, and snarky, like your average sixteen-year-old. I'll admit that most SF shows have only simple characterization at the best of times, but this is just another example of ""Firefly"" aiming low. Rather than complex, dynamic and sympathetic characters, its cast consists of shallow stereotypes, all carefully distinguished by their various pulpy eccentricities.Third, setting. ""Firefly"" is a Space Western, or a Western (In Space!), and that gimmick drives the design, the dialogue, and most of the plotting. It is also totally contrived and silly. The supposedly witty and clever dialogue is delivered in a made-up dialect that renders it stilted and artificial. Planets look like Southern California, weapons look like Colt revolvers and Winchester rifles, and the captain wears suspenders. Therefore any attempt to make the show realistic or believable on any level is completely undermined. To top it off, the theme song is incredibly irritating (the singer even has a lisp), and the incidental music consists solely of steel guitar. Moreover, the whole show is presented to us with a sort of smug aura about it, as if the producers were really proud of themselves for coming up with this hackneyed old idea.At only thirteen episodes or so, ""Firefly"" never really had a chance to take off and develop anything. Maybe by the third season it could have been good; obviously it never got that far. But it never really tries anyway, and even the pilot episode fails to create any sort of excitement or tension. After watching it, I felt no desire to continue with the rest of the episodes to find out what happens. The only thing to recommend it are the visual effects, but the studio that created them moved on to ""Battlestar"", which was a more successful show in every way.",2,"See You, Space Cowboy...",1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,3563,"[""'ve"", 'given', 'thought', 'rewatching', 'pilot', 'episode', 'recently', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'exactly', 'what', 'dislike', 'show', 'hugely', 'popular', 'show', 'only', 'lasting', 'single', 'short', 'season', 'think', 'necessary', 'provide', 'counterpoint', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'hailing', 'best', 'show', 'ever.First', 'genre', 'Firefly', 'squarely', 'action-adventure', 'series', 'being', 'set', 'future', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'futuristic', 'technology', 'also', 'very', 'little', 'science', 'fiction', 'arbitrary', 'inclusion', 'spaceship', 'Conflicts', 'are', 'generally', 'resolved', 'gunfights', 'main', 'ship', 'so', 'comfy', 'one', 'never', 'really', 'idea', 'crew', 'are', 'living', 'approach', 'technical/scientific', 'common', 'SF', 'genre', 'time', 'travel', 'aliens', 'black', 'holes', 'etc', 'as', 'well', 'character-driven', 'conflicts', 'mainstream', 'drama', 'one', 'can', 'add', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'essentially', 'drama', 'space', 'Instead', 'Firefly', 'Western', 'wholly', 'content', 'live', 'restrictions', 'genre', 'Replace', 'spaceship', 'riverboat', 'covered', 'wagon', 'Winnebago', ""'d"", 'have', 'basically', 'same', 'result', 'good', 'reason', 'be', 'set', 'space', 'then', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'set', 'space.Second', 'characters', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'created', 'wrote', 'classic', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'clever', 'genre', 'show', 'teenagers', 'Perhaps', 'so', 'accustomed', 'writing', 'teenagers', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'how', 'write', 'adults', 'result', 'none', 'characters', 'Firefly', 'act', 'age', 'relationships', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'behavior', 'emotions', 'are', 'appropriate', 'teenagers', 'who', 'are', 'doubt', 'target', 'audience', 'tend', 'be', 'selfish', 'sulky', 'snarky', 'average', 'sixteen-year-old', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'most', 'SF', 'shows', 'have', 'only', 'simple', 'characterization', 'best', 'times', 'just', 'example', 'Firefly', 'aiming', 'low', 'Rather', 'complex', 'dynamic', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'cast', 'shallow', 'stereotypes', 'carefully', 'distinguished', 'various', 'pulpy', 'eccentricities.Third', 'setting', 'Firefly', 'Space', 'Western', 'Western', 'Space', 'gimmick', 'design', 'dialogue', 'most', 'plotting', 'also', 'totally', 'contrived', 'silly', 'supposedly', 'witty', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'delivered', 'made-up', 'dialect', 'stilted', 'artificial', 'Planets', 'look', 'Southern', 'California', 'weapons', 'look', 'Colt', 'revolvers', 'Winchester', 'rifles', 'captain', 'suspenders', 'attempt', 'make', 'show', 'realistic', 'believable', 'level', 'completely', 'undermined', 'top', 'off', 'theme', 'song', 'incredibly', 'irritating', 'singer', 'even', 'lisp', 'incidental', 'music', 'solely', 'steel', 'guitar', 'Moreover', 'whole', 'show', 'presented', 'sort', 'smug', 'aura', 'producers', 'were', 'really', 'proud', 'coming', 'up', 'hackneyed', 'old', 'idea.At', 'only', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'so', 'Firefly', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'chance', 'take', 'off', 'develop', 'anything', 'Maybe', 'third', 'season', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'obviously', 'never', 'got', 'far', 'never', 'really', 'anyway', 'even', 'pilot', 'episode', 'create', 'sort', 'excitement', 'tension', 'watching', 'felt', 'desire', 'continue', 'rest', 'episodes', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'only', 'thing', 'recommend', 'are', 'visual', 'effects', 'studio', 'created', 'moved', 'Battlestar', 'was', 'more', 'successful', 'show', 'way']",N/A

You get drawn into this series incredibly fast, it's over far too soon and you're left with an insatiable hunger for more. And not just me - this is one show (the only, I think) my husband and I are equally fascinated by.There are too many aspects I love about this show to list them all, but let me highlight a few:The SettingFirefly is a small space ship, smuggling and doing odd jobs under the radar of the Alliance, the rulers of this fulture world. That's how the Firefly crew get to meet high and low in the different worlds. But most of the time, the ship is just travelling in the empty space between worlds, just a tiny fleck in the void. This solitude yet beauty of space is conveyed better here than in any other sci-fi series where the usual impression is that you can't turn your ship in a new direction without bumping into other space crafts or inhabited planets. It also puts the focus solidly on the interaction between the characters, which brings me to the next point.The CharacterisationThe people aboard Firefly are real people, with their strong and weak points, hopes and fears, world views and difficult decisions. Instead of self-important archetypes in colourful suits trying to save humanity from extinction, you get complex and realistic characters with very present and understandable issues.  The way they're disclosed to the viewer through their reactions to the different worlds Firefly visits, the problems they face and even more to each other is the show's strongest attraction, puntuated by the sparkling dialogue. This is really what makes you weep for Fox's foolish decision to kill this beauty before it was fully matured. I miss the people!The LookFirefly's world spans from the high tech you expect from a science fiction to the grit you know from a western and both are equally engaging and real to the watcher. The judicious use of handheld camera draws you into the world, but doesn't distract. Colours are used to great effect to signal the different worlds the crew move in - the yellow of the high noon prairie, the blue of high tech facilities and the deep empty blackness of space.Firefly is an awesome show. I can't wait to see the movie, and my dearest hope is that the movie will spawn a series. Firefly is a thoroughly adult show with all the best things from Whedon's other shows - Buffy and Angel: The witty yet poignant dialogue, the way the characters' inner life is brought out in the main plot, the unexpected twists and turns of a great story arc.

I HATE WESTERNS and the only entertainment I enjoyed that dealt with space was Star Wars. I was the anti-trekkie. Then one day I saw Roswell here on amazon.com and went to buy it and saw that there was a discounted price if I bought these two shows at the same time.I then figured &quot;Hey, it's a Joss Whedon show, it can't be too bad, and if I don't like it I'll just resell it.&quot; Well, two months later I still hadn't watched it and I was sorta bored so I put it in my DVD player and started watching it. I immediately fell in love with the show and was so upset when I finished it and there was no more episodes left.Now, a month later I was searching through imdb.com and came across the name Gina Torres, whom I had seen before in Angel - Season Four, Cleopatra 2525, and recently, Firefly, I clicked onto her bio and read her other films/appearances and was shocked when I saw the name &quot;Zoe&quot; twice, I looked at both titles and was elated to find out that Joss Whedon is now filming a movie entitled &quot;Serenity&quot;, which is a movie based upon this TV show, and he is having ALL of the original actors in this show portray the same characters again.

I, sadly, missed the magic that was Firefly at the time as I was involved in the conflict in Afghanistan at the time.In 2005 I went to the dollar movie theater with a date to see a movie titled Serenity. I had not seen the television show and did not realize this movie was based on that show.When the movie began, I realized I was jumping into an already established story line yet never felt lost for one moment. I was instantly drawn into this strange new world of characters and their side stories. I have to say I tremendously enjoyed the interactions between all the main characters and their conflicting personalities. The story line was rich and detailed and kept my attention the entire length of the movie.Star Trek has action yet lacks it. It is too technical and the characters feel flat and emotionless. Stars Wars is too kiddie friendly. Serenity/Firefly fits the bill of being that Adult drama based in the future in the outer reaches of space. It feels like how I believe the future really will be for man-kind.The CGI was not what is expected of a big budget film but were passable and got the job done in Serenity. It is perfect in the small screen, though, in its television run as Firefly. It is eerie seeing scenes of other space and external shots of the ship without any sound which is realistically what would probably happen.The movie motivated me to see the entire run of FireFly. I realized that, going back to the movie, there were many jokes or references I had missed the first time due to not seeing the series prior yet,  it did not detract from my film watching experience. I was saddened watching the movie then the television series.

766833,A1KFCZF2V2FS62,B0000AQS0F,"Scott C. Locklin ""Selectos nisi das mihi libe...","[7, 20]","First off, Firefly is a sort of derivative of of a Gene Rodenberry show called Andromeda which in turn, took a lot of its ideas from Babylon-5. For some reason, everybody has heard of Firefly, despite the fact that it died after 13 episodes, but nobody has heard of Andromeda, which ran for 5 years. This is unfortunate, as from what I remember, Andromeda was more interesting (so was Farscape, which I also mostly didn't see).Still, Firefly wasn't bad. Like many modern TV shows, it has only a little bit of plot (think; freaks in a cowboy space truck), but it makes up for it with strong characterization and back story. It's not about anything, but the characters are sort of interesting. There is a cowboy captain, whose main purpose is to serve as a heart throb for the sexbomb prostitute. Sexbomb hooker is actually pretty convincing; I've known women like her. They weren't hookers though (hookers tend to be a lot less sensitive and sentimental, and they're usually not that clean looking), and they were all from L.A. -which I guess is sort of like being from outer space. There is a beefy tough black lady who looks like Tina Turner, who always calls the Captain, ""sir"" like Peppermint Patty called Charlie Brown, and her laughably unlikely surfer-weasel husband. There is a nerd girl for an engineer, a wimpy upper class doctor and his psychotic teenage sister. There is also an Orc called Shane, who is, of course, my favorite character, and some kind of preacher dude who was good at acting wise and benign, and who appeared to have interesting secrets. The villains are amusing sadistic bastards, and the characters all had enough back story and depth to them (well, the psycho chick had no depth, but she was supposed to look deep), that it would have made an entertaining series if it had not gone straight to the DVD bin.One of the things which made Firefly unique is it is the first science fiction program made exclusively from a female perspective. The leading men in the show are all completely harmless, benevolent-to-women characters, except for Shane, who is made the butt of jokes when he's not actively playing the role of a cut-rate villain. Women drive most of the plot, and catering to female emotional needs is the purpose of the non-villainous male characters. Many of the situations were nerd girl obsessions, like the idea that dudes might fight over her, or that some redneck would want to own her uterus for breeding purposes. Personally, I have never even met an unmarried man who got a woman pregnant on purpose. They might exist somewhere, but the idea of a guy wanting to keep some broad captive for breeding purposes .... well, let's just call that a peculiarly female fantasy, probably brought on by reading silly bodice-ripping books by Margaret Atwood. It's pretty weird watching a TV show that so blatantly caters to the nerd girl mindset, but there you have it. I think the guy who made it also had something to do with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so, no big surprise there. I don't really mind it, though I occasionally wished they'd land their dumb bumble bee looking space ship someplace where they'd have to deal with real trouble. Also, the tough black chick needed to dump her surf bum husband and shack up with Shane or the hot prostitute.Ratings: one blast from a 45-70 mare's leg gun, and a right cross from a tough black chick.",3,"OK, but somewhat overrated",1218067200,"08 7, 2008",2008,3380,"['First', 'off', 'Firefly', 'sort', 'derivative', 'Gene', 'Rodenberry', 'show', 'called', 'Andromeda', 'turn', 'took', 'lot', 'ideas', 'Babylon-5', 'reason', 'everybody', 'heard', 'Firefly', 'fact', 'died', '13', 'episodes', 'nobody', 'heard', 'Andromeda', 'ran', '5', 'years', 'unfortunate', 'what', 'remember', 'Andromeda', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'so', 'was', 'Farscape', 'also', 'mostly', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', '.Still', 'Firefly', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'many', 'modern', 'TV', 'shows', 'only', 'little', 'bit', 'plot', 'think', 'freaks', 'cowboy', 'space', 'truck', 'up', 'strong', 'characterization', 'back', 'story', 'not', 'anything', 'characters', 'are', 'sort', 'interesting', 'cowboy', 'captain', 'main', 'purpose', 'serve', 'heart', 'throb', 'sexbomb', 'prostitute', 'Sexbomb', 'hooker', 'actually', 'pretty', 'convincing', ""'ve"", 'known', 'women', 'were', ""n't"", 'hookers', 'hookers', 'tend', 'be', 'lot', 'less', 'sensitive', 'sentimental', ""'re"", 'usually', 'not', 'clean', 'looking', 'were', 'L.A.', '-which', 'guess', 'sort', 'being', 'outer', 'space', 'beefy', 'tough', 'black', 'lady', 'who', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'who', 'always', 'Captain', 'sir', 'Peppermint', 'Patty', 'called', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'laughably', 'unlikely', 'surfer-weasel', 'husband', 'nerd', 'girl', 'engineer', 'wimpy', 'upper', 'class', 'doctor', 'psychotic', 'teenage', 'sister', 'also', 'Orc', 'called', 'Shane', 'who', 'course', 'favorite', 'character', 'kind', 'preacher', 'dude', 'who', 'was', 'good', 'acting', 'wise', 'benign', 'who', 'appeared', 'have', 'interesting', 'secrets', 'villains', 'are', 'amusing', 'sadistic', 'bastards', 'characters', 'had', 'enough', 'back', 'story', 'depth', 'well', 'psycho', 'chick', 'had', 'depth', 'was', 'supposed', 'look', 'deep', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'entertaining', 'series', 'had', 'not', 'gone', 'straight', 'DVD', 'bin.One', 'things', 'made', 'Firefly', 'unique', 'first', 'science', 'fiction', 'program', 'made', 'exclusively', 'female', 'perspective', 'leading', 'men', 'show', 'are', 'completely', 'harmless', 'benevolent-to-women', 'characters', 'Shane', 'who', 'made', 'butt', 'jokes', 'when', 'not', 'actively', 'playing', 'role', 'cut-rate', 'villain', 'Women', 'drive', 'most', 'plot', 'catering', 'female', 'emotional', 'needs', 'purpose', 'non-villainous', 'male', 'characters', 'Many', 'situations', 'were', 'nerd', 'girl', 'obsessions', 'idea', 'might', 'fight', 'redneck', 'would', 'want', 'own', 'uterus', 'breeding', 'purposes', 'Personally', 'have', 'never', 'even', 'met', 'unmarried', 'man', 'who', 'got', 'woman', 'pregnant', 'purpose', 'might', 'exist', 'somewhere', 'idea', 'guy', 'wanting', 'keep', 'broad', 'captive', 'breeding', 'purposes', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'call', 'peculiarly', 'female', 'fantasy', 'probably', 'brought', 'reading', 'silly', 'bodice-ripping', 'books', 'Margaret', 'Atwood', 'pretty', 'weird', 'watching', 'TV', 'show', 'so', 'blatantly', 'caters', 'nerd', 'girl', 'mindset', 'there', 'have', 'think', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'also', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'so', 'big', 'surprise', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'occasionally', 'wished', ""'d"", 'land', 'dumb', 'bumble', 'bee', 'looking', 'space', 'ship', 'someplace', 'where', ""'d"", 'have', 'deal', 'real', 'trouble', 'Also', 'tough', 'black', 'chick', 'needed', 'dump', 'surf', 'bum', 'husband', 'shack', 'up', 'Shane', 'hot', 'prostitute.Ratings', 'one', 'blast', '45-70', 'mare', 'leg', 'gun', 'right', 'cross', 'tough', 'black', 'chick']",N/A

And, really, isn't that what we want in our TV and movies - characters whose stories and their endings are important to us because we care?  Someone else mentioned ""Star Wars"" and how the prequels sucked.  Why?  Because no one cared about the characters.The writers of Firefly have also created a unique culture of the future, even down the nuances of language.  The intermittent use of Chinese which flows naturally into conversations (watch it with the CC on, there are NO translations..  everyone has to use context to figure out what's being said.  Brilliant!) and the vocabulary - ""a reader"" for ""psychic"", ""sly"" for ""gay"", ""shepherd"" for ""priest"" - create an environment that is alien and yet familiar.  We are disoriented because we are forced to wade through their culture and make a place for oureselves there.

766863,AI0KXH1O95X0H,B0000AQS0F,"Sir Robert ""Order of the Anglophiles""","[3, 3]","I first came to learn of ""Firefly"" after seeing ""Serenity."" About a month ago, HBO Signature Asia began advertising the feature film ""Serenity"" in most cable channels here. I found it odd that HBO would advertise in a channel other than its own. Initially, I felt that there must be some kind of buzz for HBO to do this. I do know from a year before that Mr. Roger Ebert gave ""Serenity"" some good marks but I just wasn't able to see it, either because it didn't show here, or maybe I just missed it. So by HBO's recommendations, I watched it. ""Serenity"" did leave some good impressions on me. Who says that Science Fiction movies need to be high- budgeted in order to work?So how do I describe Firefly?? Truly, it is unlike anything I've ever seen. While it is undoubtedly a science fiction, the feel of the Western Frontier past and some cultural mixture of East and West have been thrown into the lot. It's like...... well, it's like throwing the carrots, celery, spinach and the squash all together into the blender. While this fruit and vegetable concoction may not be so good, ""Firefly"" on the other hand, is. Despite its flaws, this show has a high amount of likeability.Okay, sorry to you Browncoats for saying that the show has some faults, but here are two or three that I must point out:1.) First off, I think the actors need to improve their Chinese. 95% of the time when they speak Chinese, I can't understand a GORRAM! thing they're saying. And, I'm supposed to understand it, living in Taiwan and all. So instead of being serious about a scene, I sometimes find myself guffawing after they've said their Chinese lines. However, this misfire will mostly go unnoticed to Western viewers.2.) Second, since ""Firefly"" is a mixture of the future and the past, it sometimes suffers heavily from present day mentality. I really do not know how to explain this well. It's like the Future but with the Present Day mentality imposed on it. For example, one would think that in the future, security technology would have made it hard for crooks to find a loophole in the system. But right there during the episode ""Trash,"" we see our heroes hack the garbage disposal system IN BROAD DAYLIGHT and in a place that was supposed to be crawling with Feds!! Maybe the feds were sleeping or the tracking computer malfunctioned when our heroes were performing their heist. Hmmm, the police sleeping and computers malfunctioning........... sounds like the present.3.) There are other flaws, but these are mostly minor. Things like budgetary constraints and some of the CGI that could have used improvement (like the canyon chase in the episode ""The Message."")Far from downgrading the show, I point the above because I really wish that ""Firefly"" gets a second season soon. To Mr. Joss Whedon: I hope my suggestions are helpful. ""Firefly"" has a lot of potential in it. Frankly, I'd rather choose this show than the new ""Battlestar Galactica."" (Although, I must point out that ""B.G."" is a good show itself. It's just that it sometimes feels like it goes on and on in a circle that we get tired of the supposed character development. And, it has somewhat become obvious who the Ceylons masquerading as humans are. Really, most of the time, I get this feeling that no actual human have been left alive and that all those on board Galactica and Pegasus are actually Ceylons just waiting for their programs to start up!!)""Firefly"" has a lot going for it. The characters, while these are essentially space thieves and smugglers, are likeable enough and never stereotyped. It's the relationships between the characters that make it work. As the show progressed on, there's almost no contention between the crew members. Captain Reynolds has one very loyal crew there! This is the magic formula that gets them through all their dangerous adventures (especially in the episode ""War Stories."" Anyway, I guess I'm just tired of shows that have mutinous crews in them.)Another thing that ""Firefly"" has in its advantage is its lack of pretension. This is the Layman's Science Fiction. It totally lacks the technical lingo that is the trademark of the Star Trek Series. And, while there are no aliens about or any presentation of how aliens live on other planets, it does give us a view of what human life on the frontier planets might be like. Sadly though, there aren't enough episodes to really give us a larger picture of this.....The cultural mishmash in this Whedonesque `verse help make it all fresh; as do the script and the witty dialogues. There's a good dose of humor thrown in to make things fun. And, it's not dumb as some purport it to be, but quite intelligent (except when it shows that Present Day Mentality.) I like the character Mr. Nathan Fillion plays, as the Captain Malcolm Reynolds and this relationship he has with Inara (Morena Baccarin.) Both of them have trememdous sex appeal. There's electricity there between them but kept wisely in check.Overall, ""Firefly"" entertains. But to be fair to you REAVERS out there, I must say that it may not please everyone's tastes. Except ice cream, what does anyway?? (GASP!!! Did I just say Reavers?? *Shocked* I mean to say `Readers.' Apologies!!)  If you watch the show, just go along for the ride, suppress the Critic in you, then put it under the sofa and sit on it if you have to. Eventually, there's a good chance that the ""Firefly"" glow will get into you, because it really has that quality.Not since ""Brisco County,"" ""Star Trek Voyager"" and ""Friends"" have I been entertained like this. Of course, this is my opinion. It's up to you REAVERS to find out for yourself. GASP!!!

This was a show that deserved to last a while. Instead we got 14 episodes and a good movie, ""Serenity.""Firefly"" is a space Western set 500 years in the future. Captain Malcolm Reynolds and the eight persons in his crew -- each of them individualistic and finely crafted -- are petty crooks and gunmen, including a mechanic, a pilot, a beautiful ""companion"", a preacher, a doctor, and a mysterious weird child. They skulk around the inhabited planets in their decrepit spaceship ""Serenity"" looking for work and plunder. Behind this simple outline are deep and dark stories.The Serenity crew is a diverse, close-knit, mutually-supportive group we'd all like to belong too. They have their warts and they fight and argue -- but the come together when it matters. The set is wonderful; the interior of a space ship that looks like it works, not a tin foil mock up. The soundtrack music is appropriately creepy; the camera work is oddly-angled; the lighting goes from the brightest of bright to dark and menacing. The script is clever and amusing. Homey scenes alternate with quick violence, brutality, and a fair amount of sex.""Firefly"" reminds me of the old TV Western ""Maverick"" with James Garner. ""Maverick"" was a Western like you had never seen before with everything just a bit off-kilter. ""Firefly"" is like this.

Yes, the show ended before its time due to lack of interest by the general public, FOX's bad decision making, and even - at least in my view - poor marketing to begin with. Heck, I didn't know this show even existed until after it went off the air (yes, I am part of that general public that let this fantastic show die - I am ashamed). You will likely read countless reviews here on Amazon describing the excellent story, the detailed worlds, the fine acting (okay, not 100%, but better than most we see on TV these days), and the ability to capture ones imagination and make you want to watch the next episode and the entire series (over and over again). That is the gift that Joss brought to us with this series and the movie. Is this show for everyone? No - but that's like asking if Star Wars, Avengers, or Family Guy is for everyone. There is a market for this show and it saddens me that it wasn't ""big"" enough for the bean counters. It also saddens me that no one else has picked this up (and that Joss himself seems to have moved on to other projects). But alas, you can read about this epic adventure all you like - I simply ask that you give it a try and rate it yourself.Amazon helps in that endeavor by making the entire series available via Amazon Prime streaming. Not only do you get great, fast free 2-day shipping, but you get the ability to watch series like this and many others at no additional cost. If not here, then try your local video store or that big red box or that streaming/DVD company that rhymes with ""wetmix"" (okay, not my most creative, but you get the idea). I can safely promise that this series is like no other you've likely seen. It brings together Sci-Fi, Western, Action, and Adventure into one fantastic 1-season series. I've purchased this numerous times already (for myself, for a gift, as a replacement for myself when someone close asked for my copy, etc) and now even watch it on occasion via Amazon Prime, even though I have the discs. As you can tell, my review is likely biased by the fact that this series changed my opinion of a good TV series, like Matrix did in the 90s and Star Wars did in the 70s for Sci-Fi viewing audiences.

Why? Because the network execs had their heads firmly wedged in very dark, uncomfortable places.Ever since it got canceled, I've been hoping against hope for some kind of miracle. This DVD set was the first part of that miracle. The upcoming movie, &quot;Serenity,&quot; due in the Summer of 2005, is the second. If you don't see this series before that movie comes out, you are going to miss out on one of the best sci-fi adventures to hit the big or small screens. You can't EVEN be planning to shell out your hard-earned money for the next Star Wars ripoff and not see &quot;Serenity&quot; . . . can you? No, I'll answer that: You can't.&quot;What's the big deal,&quot; you ask? Ok, look, I'll tell you straight up -- this is a space western. Yes. There are spaceships in the skies and cattle rustlers on the ground. Does that sound cheesy? Well, it did to me, but then I saw the first episode and I was hooked. The characters are so fascinating, the dialogue so witty, the situations so interesting, I just can't get enough of this show. Literally. It could be about space turnip farmers and I would love it. The reason for the rustic living conditions is kind of explained, and you do get used to it. Really!And now for the good stuff: There are no regulations-spouting goody-goodies here. Sometimes the crew does the noble thing, sometimes not. Bad guys usually get what's coming to them, whether it's &quot;the right thing to do&quot; or not. Some of the characters are mostly good, some you're not sure about, and &quot;Jayne&quot; in particular (Adam Baldwin's character) is so thoroughly rotten and untrustworthy, you want to kill him, but he's so annoyingly FUNNY you'd hate it if he were gone.

Then another reviewer gives this big long explanation on why it was cancelled. Let me tell you something KAD, Dark Angel could have lasted at least 5 seasons. If FOX was serious about Firefly they should have aired the episodes in the correct order. FOX should have known Firefly wouldn't last if the story arch was out of order. So basically they took off a show that would have lasted to put a shown on that would be aired out of order. I think maybe if FOX aired Firefly in order it might have lasted 3 seasons, but since they didn't the world will never know. I'm sorry that I'm a hard core Dark Angel fan, but I don't know hy Firefly wasn't aired on SCIFI in the first place.

Not really being too excited about wasting your money, but curious about the show, you've meandered over to the customer review section at Amazon.com. Now you've met me (Hello!)and I say, &quot;Firefly is the show that was too good to live.&quot; You wonder what I mean by this, and, to your excitment (OK, I'm being melodramatic) you discover that I am now about to explain. And I say...I was just being ironic. I don't believe there was a conspiracy to kill Firefly because it was too good, it's just that Firefly WAS so good, it figures that it would only last fourteen episodes and then be axed.Firefly, as I imagine it, was the imaginative playground of an extraorinarily creative team of artists who give free rein to their every latent productive urge that could not be expressed on Buffy/Angel. Firefly seems to have been designed in such a way that almost any genre or theme could be explored in a variety of strange and fascinating combinations that would have been impossible in any other format.The show combines its thematic twists, genre busting, and stylistic conventions into a postmodern brew that comments on the contemporary while projecting it into the future and past.With nine fascinating and charasmatic characters introduced in this series, the possibilities would have been endless for a show such as this. One can only imagine where Whedon and crew would have taken this show, but faint glimmers are hinted at by a variety of nestled clues and hints.It is very depressing that it was canceled, but its unfinished nature does not make it to unworthwhile to watch, for we have fourteen existing episodes. And what makes them so great to watch is the obvious love the artists put into the show, and how much fun it obviously was to make.I cannot recommend this show highly enough. The show was not designed to be a cash cow, but as an outlet for the expression of the artisic potentials of some very talented individuals for whom this show was obviously no joke (though frequently hilarious). The show was created by some very intelligent minds, and it does not stupify its content; like Hitchcock, it functions wonderfully on two levels, entertaiment and intellectual. No matter how short this star burned, its light was bright, and it leaves an afterburn in the mind, which inspires both heartfelt gratitude and the grief of dashed potential.",5,Firefly to good to live,1072742400,"12 30, 2003",2003,2516,"['love', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'have', 'heard', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'helmed', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'heard', 'was', 'canceled', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Not', 'really', 'being', 'too', 'excited', 'wasting', 'money', 'curious', 'show', ""'ve"", 'meandered', 'customer', 'review', 'section', 'Amazon.com', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'met', 'Hello', 'say', 'quot', 'Firefly', 'show', 'was', 'too', 'good', 'live.', 'quot', 'wonder', 'what', 'mean', 'excitment', 'OK', ""'m"", 'being', 'melodramatic', 'discover', 'am', 'now', 'explain', 'say', 'was', 'just', 'being', 'ironic', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'conspiracy', 'kill', 'Firefly', 'was', 'too', 'good', 'just', 'Firefly', 'WAS', 'so', 'good', 'would', 'only', 'last', 'fourteen', 'episodes', 'then', 'be', 'axed.Firefly', 'imagine', 'was', 'imaginative', 'playground', 'extraorinarily', 'creative', 'team', 'artists', 'who', 'give', 'free', 'rein', 'latent', 'productive', 'urge', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'expressed', 'Buffy/Angel', 'Firefly', 'have', 'been', 'designed', 'such', 'way', 'almost', 'genre', 'theme', 'could', 'be', 'explored', 'variety', 'strange', 'fascinating', 'combinations', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'other', 'format.The', 'show', 'thematic', 'twists', 'genre', 'busting', 'stylistic', 'conventions', 'postmodern', 'brew', 'comments', 'contemporary', 'projecting', 'future', 'past.With', 'nine', 'fascinating', 'charasmatic', 'characters', 'introduced', 'series', 'possibilities', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'endless', 'show', 'such', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'where', 'Whedon', 'crew', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'show', 'faint', 'glimmers', 'are', 'hinted', 'variety', 'nestled', 'clues', 'hints.It', 'very', 'depressing', 'was', 'canceled', 'unfinished', 'nature', 'not', 'make', 'unworthwhile', 'watch', 'have', 'fourteen', 'existing', 'episodes', 'what', 'so', 'great', 'watch', 'obvious', 'artists', 'put', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'obviously', 'was', 'make.I', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'show', 'highly', 'enough', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'designed', 'be', 'cash', 'cow', 'outlet', 'expression', 'artisic', 'potentials', 'very', 'talented', 'individuals', 'whom', 'show', 'was', 'obviously', 'joke', 'frequently', 'hilarious', 'show', 'was', 'created', 'very', 'intelligent', 'minds', 'not', 'stupify', 'content', 'Hitchcock', 'wonderfully', 'two', 'levels', 'entertaiment', 'intellectual', 'matter', 'how', 'short', 'star', 'burned', 'light', 'was', 'bright', 'afterburn', 'mind', 'heartfelt', 'gratitude', 'grief', 'dashed', 'potential']",N/A
766880,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B0000AQS0F,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[11, 11]","I was one of the people who loved Dark Angel. Fox in their infinite wisdom rescheduled that show to its death apparently to make room for this new sci-fi series by the creator of Buffy. So I was a bit put off by this ""Firefly"" show replacing one of my favorite programs at the time. I'm still a sci-fi fan so I watched Firefly. By the end of that premier episode (which ironically wasn't the first episode... more of Fox's infinite wisdom) I realize I'm looking at an innovative and well presented program. I still miss Dark Angel and wished it had a longer lifespan, but I in no way fault Joss Whedon and his excellent show Firefly for that.Firefly is a beautiful blend of old west and outer space. Sounds strange, right? Well take it from me. The concept works. It works better than it might sound outright. The reason it works is because of two things: The backdrop universe they created and the well-written stories in front of it. The back-story is rich with history and this show takes a life of its own because of it. When the program is over you really get the feel that these people in this futuristic/western society is going. Kudos to Joss for sticking strong with that continuity.The writing for this show is nothing short of excellent and reaches the level of gifted more than once. I think what really makes the show fresh is that you can never really know what the characters will do next. You know their disposition and who they are, but just about every episode has some scene where someone does something unexpected yet still in character. After seeing tons of shows where people actions are so predictable you wonder why you bother watching Firely gives you that extra effort.This is not a family show in case some of you are thinking Firefly is Star Wars-esque. Every episode has elements of violence and sexual situations at one level or another. At the same time the complicated moral delimas the characters deal with can be considered a good thing for a thinking teen to watch. While Firefly isn't a ""parents strongly cautioned"" kind of show I would assume it a PG-13 (TV-14, whatever) if you are screening for your kids.The DVD set is a must buy. Not only do you get every episode that aired, but also episodes that didn't. The ones we missed are well worth seeing. Actually some of the best episodes can be found there. The documentaries are pretty cool too. The production method is a bit different than what most television producers would decide, and I think that makes a difference. There is an outtakes or blooper reel in the DVD too. It's not that amazing, but you get a chance to see the actors have a bit of fun. The other extras are short, but nice enough. Nothing I would consider dead weight. Haven't heard the commentiary. When I do I'll update the review.Considering the price and the quality of the show this DVD set is a steal. The DVD quality is top notch too (sharp picture, crisp and clear audio). If you are a sci-fi fan and missed this show you REALLY need to check this out. It's top notch storytelling with top notch effects, sets and acting. Fox has never been good with their sci-fi shows. Only X-Files got proper treatment from them in spite of the fact they had some other high quality programs (which were all treated like dirt). Firefly should have had a longer lifespan. Maybe with the Serenity movie and the Sci-Fi Channel's interest there will be more to see in the future.

This is not for the fans, or for anyone who's seen a couple of the episodes.This is for the people who have had no chance to know just how good this show is.  And to them I say:This is the most wonderful thing I have ever seen grace the small screen.  This is the show that was so good that, while it was airing, the fans raised thousands of dollars to take out a full page newspaper add thanking the creators and asking Fox to keep the show on the air.  That didn't happen.  Not everyone can understand, or want to.This is the show that makes me laugh, and alternately cry.  It is realistic, and beautiful in the way that only things that are real and honest are.Joss Whedon said it was about nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things.  It is also about the right to be free and independent.The story is that a doctor breaks his sister out of a top secret government institution that has been torturing her.  They take refuge and run from the law on one Serenity, firefly class spaceship captained by Mal Reynolds, a verteran on the losing side (the independents) of a galactic civil war.  There are no aliens in this space western.  The reason that there are no aliens is because this show is about humanity, and all its problems, trials and tribulations.  Joss Whedon didn't see the need to throw aliens into the mix to 'create problems'.The characters are standard fare: a preacher, hardass butt-kicking woman, pilot, captain, mechanic, burly ill-mannered hardass guy, crazy genuis butt-kicking girl (more of a Whedon thing), and companion (well-educated member of the world's olderst known profession, though more of a geisha).  The actors were exemplarily cast, and there is excellent chemistry between them.  And each gets their 'moment to shine' in which they become more than cliches.It's a damn shame that this wasn't given more of a chance to be a success like it could have been.  Like it should have been.  Even with the movie, there is so much untold story.

766900,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B0000AQS0F,Steven Aldersley,"[2, 2]","I spent most of this week watching the 14 episodes of Firefly for the second time in my life, and I think I appreciated it even more this time around. The TV show was cancelled before all of the Season 1 episodes were shown, although they ultimately aired on The Science Channel.The series failed for a number of reasons; the main one being that the episodes were not shown in the correct order, which was a stupid decision because the feature-length opening episode introduces all of the characters.So why do I like it?Firefly is a mix of action, drama, romance, and adventure. Although it's science fiction, the characters often talk like cowboys. Josh Whedon (Buffy, The Avengers) created the series, as well as directing three episodes and being involved as a writer.The characters have real depth, but the development isn't rushed. The origin of the relationships and character traits are explained gradually as the series progresses. Many of the characters are mysterious, and will make you question their true motivations. But, through it all, each character always seems real. You'll meet a married couple, war veterans, a preacher, a doctor, a psychologically damaged girl, a genius engineer, an apparently dumb mercenary, and a high-class prostitute. It's fascinating to see the existing bonds between some of the characters, and the development of new bonds.Episodes often show the crew taking on a task of some kind to earn their living. These assignments are often illegal, but can also become somewhat noble. If you are a fan of Whedon, you'll know that he uses humor regularly, and it's often present in Firefly. It can be pretty campy at times, but the writing is strong and it never comes across as stupid. Jaynestown is probably the funniest episode, and you'll understand why if you watch the episodes in the correct sequence.I would have to say that I like every character, and that's rare for me with a cast of this size. The biggest mystery in the series surrounds River (Summer Glau), who plays the sister of the ship's doctor, Simon (Sean Maher). Their relationship is arguably the strongest within the group, and there's always a sense that River's story drives the entire series.The Blu-ray includes all of the episodes, and the picture quality is good for the most part. Some of the darker images have lower quality, but the series is so good that you won't sit there criticizing the image. The special features include plenty of commentaries, as well as a making of feature, deleted scenes, and other assorted goodies.If you do become hooked on the series, you'll need to watch Serenity (2005), which was a two-hour movie wrapping up the main story. That's a fantastic science fiction movie, but you'll appreciate it more if you know the characters well. Firefly runs for almost 11 hours, and you'll end up wishing for more. The movie gives the show a proper ending, and won't leave you hanging.At the time of writing, it's available on Amazon.com for less than $20. Buy it if you like Whedon, science fiction, or well-written characters. Incidentally, the set is housed in a regular Blu-ray case with room for the three discs, so it won't look out of place on your shelf.",4,"Characters with depth, and a fun ride with plenty of secrets",1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,3200,"['spent', 'most', 'week', 'watching', '14', 'episodes', 'Firefly', 'second', 'time', 'life', 'think', 'appreciated', 'even', 'more', 'time', 'around', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'Season', '1', 'episodes', 'were', 'shown', 'ultimately', 'aired', 'Science', 'Channel.The', 'series', 'failed', 'number', 'reasons', 'main', 'one', 'being', 'episodes', 'were', 'not', 'shown', 'correct', 'order', 'was', 'stupid', 'decision', 'feature-length', 'opening', 'episode', 'characters.So', 'why', 'do', 'Firefly', 'mix', 'action', 'drama', 'romance', 'adventure', 'science', 'fiction', 'characters', 'often', 'talk', 'cowboys', 'Josh', 'Whedon', 'Buffy', 'Avengers', 'created', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'directing', 'three', 'episodes', 'being', 'involved', 'writer.The', 'characters', 'have', 'real', 'depth', 'development', ""n't"", 'rushed', 'origin', 'relationships', 'character', 'traits', 'are', 'explained', 'gradually', 'series', 'Many', 'characters', 'are', 'mysterious', 'will', 'make', 'question', 'true', 'motivations', 'character', 'always', 'real', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'married', 'couple', 'war', 'veterans', 'preacher', 'doctor', 'psychologically', 'damaged', 'girl', 'genius', 'engineer', 'apparently', 'dumb', 'mercenary', 'high-class', 'prostitute', 'fascinating', 'see', 'existing', 'bonds', 'characters', 'development', 'new', 'bonds.Episodes', 'often', 'show', 'crew', 'taking', 'task', 'kind', 'earn', 'living', 'assignments', 'are', 'often', 'illegal', 'can', 'also', 'become', 'somewhat', 'noble', 'are', 'fan', 'Whedon', ""'ll"", 'know', 'humor', 'regularly', 'often', 'present', 'Firefly', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'campy', 'times', 'writing', 'strong', 'never', 'across', 'stupid', 'Jaynestown', 'probably', 'funniest', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'why', 'watch', 'episodes', 'correct', 'sequence.I', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'like', 'character', 'rare', 'cast', 'size', 'biggest', 'mystery', 'series', 'River', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'who', 'sister', 'ship', 'doctor', 'Simon', 'Sean', 'Maher', 'relationship', 'arguably', 'strongest', 'group', 'always', 'sense', 'River', 'story', 'entire', 'series.The', 'Blu-ray', 'episodes', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'darker', 'images', 'have', 'lower', 'quality', 'series', 'so', 'good', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sit', 'there', 'criticizing', 'image', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'plenty', 'commentaries', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'feature', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'other', 'assorted', 'goodies.If', 'do', 'become', 'hooked', 'series', ""'ll"", 'need', 'watch', 'Serenity', '2005', 'was', 'two-hour', 'movie', 'wrapping', 'up', 'main', 'story', 'fantastic', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'more', 'know', 'characters', 'well', 'Firefly', 'almost', '11', 'hours', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'wishing', 'more', 'movie', 'show', 'proper', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'hanging.At', 'time', 'writing', 'available', 'Amazon.com', 'less', '20', 'Buy', 'like', 'Whedon', 'science', 'fiction', 'well-written', 'characters', 'Incidentally', 'set', 'housed', 'regular', 'Blu-ray', 'case', 'room', 'three', 'discs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'look', 'place', 'shelf']",N/A

I did this because I promised myself to someday own the Blu-ray of the show.  Until yesterday, I had not yet bought it, since $60 to $80 is still a little steep for me (currently $62.99).  But yesterday Amazon ran the one day deal for $18.99 for the Blu-ray set!  I awoke to the email notification and immediately grabbed the deal.  Now I own the Blu-ray set for a dollar LESS than I sold the DVDs for!!Ya gotta love those deals of the day!!!FYI for the poor deprived people who don't know the show - DO NOT miss this!

Cowboys in space, or is it Space Pirates, Loads of misbehaving, crime and excitement. All without Aliens. &#34;Captain Malcom Reynolds aka Mal&#34; is played by Nathan Fillion.  Excellent role for him, and the rest of the characters are wonderful as well.  If you have never watched Firefly, you need to, it's a wonderful show and it was a crime that they cancelled the series so early in its developement.  There are 13 episodes.  Make sure to pick up the movie &#34;Serenity&#34; after watching this season, it is the final &#34;Big Episode&#34; and it helps to pull the story together with some history as to why things are the way they are. I have seen this series many times, and enjoy it everytime.  &#34;Kaylee&#34; is my favorite character played by Jewel Staite, she is the ships mechanic, so fun and sweet.  Then there is &#34;Jayne&#34;, played by Adam Baldwin, the tough guy, so funny and full of mischief. &#34;Zoe&#34;, played by Gina Torres is Mal's 2nd in charge, definitely an amazon woman, very strong and Beautiful. Then there is &#34;Inara&#34;, played by the beautiful Morena Baccarin, is the ships Bonafide Companion/prostitute. Zoe's husband is &#34;Wash&#34;, the pilot, played by Alan Tudyk, so funny! &#34;Simon and River Tam&#34; are brother and sister on the show played by Sean Maher and River Glau, &#34;Shepperd Book&#34;, played by Ron Glass..  Oh I could go on and on, but just watch it! You won't be disappointed.  One thing I'd like to add:  When the series aired for the first time on tv, they aired the episode &#34;Train Job&#34; first, then they changed days on the show, and times, skipped a week here or there, no wonder the show didn't do well, people were having a hard time finding it.  And then they cancelled it, only after airing 11 episodes, so 2 of the episodes in this series were not originally aired.  Ok, enough of my rambling.

I've caught re-runs on tv when I can find them, and I can honestly say that this is from my amateur opinion a GOOD show.I personally see a lot of references to the anime 'Trigun', the premise seems very similar.  The artistic choice of combining space exploration and the old west is a neat concept by it's creators.Sci-Fi element wise this is a little on the light side.  There are no laser pistals, or anything of that nature.  Like Trigun, the weapons of choice still seem to be bullets.  Also I don't recall ever seeing any aliens.  I could be wrong about this though...I then saw 'Serenity' when it was released.  This confirmed for me that this franchise really was good and also sadly did not get the justice it was due.  I was not blown away by the movie, but at the same time could see the merit in it.  Now years later I would like to completely submerge myself in it and really give it my undivided attention.  The fact that fan-boys are still adament about this series further drives the point home that the networks and studios made a grave mistake canceling it.  Unfortunately that's life.  We live in a society where people care more about what some degenerates are doing down by the Jersey Shore.  Thought provoking, plausible Sci-Fi shows and movies with great actors are just not in demand anymore, for the most part...It's a shame really.  Nathan Fillion, (who SHOULD have been the Green Lantern), is a charming but tuff when necessary captain.  Adam Baldwin is a bad ass who also seemed a bit clumsey to me at times.  In my opinion the whole cast was good.As I said I've never seen the entire series, but now that it's so cheap, I will buy this series and 'Serenity' and watch it back to back.  Then I can call myself a true Fan-Boy of 'Firefly.'  For me the DVD release will be just fine.  I've seen no major posts about any defects or anything of that nature, so I'm fairly confident this will be a good purchase.For those of you who are still sad this went off the air, I feel your pain.  I loved 'Spider-Man the 1994 series.'  It was canceled and NEVER released completely on DVD in America.  'Mantis' was good as well, along with the 2002 'He-Man'.  And let us not forget how great Toonami and Adult Swim used to be.  One of my biggest regrets is that I didn't watch Anime back then when it was so easily available.

Even Firefly's premere episode got delayed by about 18 minutes (9 of which were commercials!) so those of us recording the program missed a lot of that episode as well as entire other episodes. There are people at Fox who should be punished, but that is another story. Firefly is one of those shows so well written that even people who shun SciFi (my wife) enjoyed it. Instead of being written to a formula, Joss W took the high road with a great mix of the verbal and the visual. I'm not sure what the budget was, but the money was well spent on sets and guest stars.

766942,A1ZOIGQHW7FPT2,B0000AQS0F,Thorvald,"[6, 6]","3200+ other reviews have already said it: This is best science fiction television series ever made.Firefly, which I didn't see until it was off the air, was originally recommended to me by a group of serious Heinlein fans whose opinion I value. They weren't wrong. Firefly achieved in three episodes the level of world creation and characters that took original Star Trek nearly three seasons to reach. Firefly has strong shades of Heinlein in it, in all the best ways. Read Heinlein's ""Between Planets"" to see what a young Mal Reynolds fighting his revolution might be like. Heinlein's great novel about slavery, ""Citizen of the Galaxy"" will show you the Alliance worlds with their rich and powerful enslaving those beneath. And, of course, you'll see Inara in Heinlein's character Tamara, in ""Time Enough for Love."" Cowboys, horses, and spaceships all mixed together? Heinlein was there long since. If you're a Firefly fan who hasn't yet read Heinlein, I envy you. You have a wondrous reading adventure awaiting you. And I dare say Heinlein, who was a big Star Trek fan, would love Firefly, too.This richness of world creation, with Joss Whedon's brilliance in casting, dialog, and directing, all go in to making Firefly the wonderful story and show it is. If you like Heinlein, if you like Star Trek, if you like good science fiction in any form, you will almost certainly fall in love with Firefly and, with the rest of us, mourn that it ended far too soon.As for whether you should get the DVDs versus the Blu-Rays...I have had both and watched both on big screen high def televisions. I am a little sad to say the Blu-rays weren't worth the upgrade. If you already have the DVD set, it's not, in my opinion, worth getting the Blu-rays expecting a major improvement in the look of the video. With ""Lord of the Rings"" the difference was stunning. The Blu-ray video was gorgeous, a substantial step up from the DVDs. With Firefly, it's more hit-and-miss. Some of the video is better with the Blu-rays, but not all of it, and some of the video flaws are more apparent with the Blu-rays than with the DVDs. It's not a consistent improvement in quality.",5,Firefly Like Heinlein,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,2153,"['3200+', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'best', 'science', 'fiction', 'television', 'series', 'ever', 'made.Firefly', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'was', 'air', 'was', 'originally', 'recommended', 'group', 'serious', 'Heinlein', 'fans', 'opinion', 'value', 'were', ""n't"", 'wrong', 'Firefly', 'achieved', 'three', 'level', 'world', 'creation', 'characters', 'took', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'nearly', 'three', 'seasons', 'reach', 'Firefly', 'strong', 'shades', 'Heinlein', 'best', 'ways', 'Read', 'Heinlein', 'Between', 'Planets', 'see', 'what', 'young', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'fighting', 'revolution', 'might', 'be', 'Heinlein', 'great', 'novel', 'slavery', 'Citizen', 'Galaxy', 'will', 'show', 'Alliance', 'worlds', 'rich', 'powerful', 'enslaving', 'beneath', 'course', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Inara', 'Heinlein', 'character', 'Tamara', 'Time', 'Enough', 'Love', 'Cowboys', 'horses', 'mixed', 'together', 'Heinlein', 'was', 'there', 'long', ""'re"", 'Firefly', 'fan', 'who', ""n't"", 'yet', 'read', 'Heinlein', 'envy', 'have', 'wondrous', 'reading', 'adventure', 'awaiting', 'dare', 'say', 'Heinlein', 'who', 'was', 'big', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fan', 'would', 'love', 'Firefly', 'too.This', 'richness', 'world', 'creation', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'brilliance', 'casting', 'dialog', 'directing', 'go', 'making', 'Firefly', 'wonderful', 'story', 'show', 'like', 'Heinlein', 'like', 'Star', 'Trek', 'like', 'good', 'science', 'fiction', 'form', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'fall', 'love', 'Firefly', 'rest', 'mourn', 'ended', 'far', 'too', 'soon.As', 'should', 'get', 'DVDs', 'Blu-Rays', 'have', 'had', 'watched', 'big', 'screen', 'high', 'def', 'televisions', 'am', 'little', 'sad', 'say', 'Blu-rays', 'were', ""n't"", 'worth', 'upgrade', 'already', 'have', 'DVD', 'set', 'not', 'opinion', 'getting', 'Blu-rays', 'expecting', 'major', 'improvement', 'look', 'video', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'difference', 'was', 'stunning', 'Blu-ray', 'video', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'substantial', 'step', 'up', 'DVDs', 'Firefly', 'more', 'hit-and-miss', 'video', 'better', 'Blu-rays', 'not', 'video', 'flaws', 'are', 'more', 'apparent', 'Blu-rays', 'DVDs', 'not', 'consistent', 'improvement', 'quality']",N/A
766943,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B0000AQS0F,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[1, 1]","""Firefly"" the television series is many things: western space opera; political action adventure; pure escapism entertainment.  While all of these things make this series a huge blast to watch the center pole of the series is Nathan Fillion's (of ""Castle"" fame) Captain Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds.  As captain of the eponymous ship he crews eight other significant members who are each very well developed over the series and, as important, are a reflection of the different sides of the man who is Mal.First officer Zoe Washburne (played by Gina Torres) is a confederate of Mal's, a fellow browncoat, who fought the good rebel fight along with him and lost the battle but the fight lives on.  She represents Mal's fighting spirit and his notion that, no matter how bleak the future looks, you look it right square in the eyes and stare it down.  She also represents his idealism.Pilot extraordinaire Hoban ""Wash"" Washburne (played by underrated actor Alan Tudyk) is a lighter slice of life, married to Zoe and always ready to see the world through a ""this is sorta ridiculous"" lense.  He represents Mal's muted ability and desire to relax, to rest.Courtesan Inara Serra (played by dropdead gorgeous Morena Baccarin of recent ""V"" fame) is a complicated love interest of Mal's.  He's torn by her work (a high class space prostitute essentially) and she's torn by his stoicism and his love for his ship and crew versus herself.  She's a worldly, politically savvy individual and she represents Mal's eroticism and his philanthropic love.  He would go to the ends of the universe for Inara though he would rarely admit this to her.Jayne Cobb (played by the Baldwin known as Adam--check him out in the old classic ""My Bodyguard""--he looks virtually the same 20 years later!) is the immoral, selfish, and brutish grunt of the crew.  He just might sell any or all of them out for a big enough paycheck...or to save his own hide.  He represents Mal's raw aggression and desire to overcome his obstacles by virtue of force, if not by will.Firefly's technical and mechanical expertise is found in Kaylee Frye (played by youthful Jewel Staite), who is practically at one with her ship and can fix just about any of its maladies.  She is also a wide-eyed innocent, a newly blooming flower, taking in the world around her as it comes and believing the best about people.  She represents Mal's purity.The enigmatic Shepherd Book (played by character actor Ron Glass) brings a little >ahem&lt; color to the all-white cast in more ways than one.  He is the saint among the sinners but the more we know the more we know that he hasn't always been a saint.  He is also the sage, able to dispense wordly and spiritual advice, and he repeatedly challenges Mal to look outside of himself to the bigger picture and to Firefly's version of ""God"" (not well developed but seemingly close to a Judeo-Christian representation).  Shepherd represents Mal's godly qualities, of being a Moses/ shepherd to his crew, and also to his spiritual nature (tamped down and ground into the dirt as it is) and even doing God's work in spite of himself.Dr. Simon Tam (played by Sean Maher) comes aboard with his sister, River Tam (played by balletic Summer Glau), in his bid to help his brain-scrambled living-weapon sister away from the intergalactic ruling authority of ""The Alliance"" who has been experimenting on her and turning her into some sort of super weapon.  Simon is fierce, righteously opinionated, and loyal to a fault toward his sister.  River is a glyph, a human key to the masked potentials of human feats (both mental and physical) as well as a fractured, tortured soul.  (Her storyline is the most distressing and maudlin of the series and threatens to bring the series down a notch at times unfortunately.)  As a family unit they represent Mal's sense of family and as him being a father figure.  Individually, Dr. Tam represents Mal's single-minded determination.  River represents Mal's untapped potential and belief (along with Shepherd Book) in things greater than himself.It is quite the compelling character study and this cast of seemingly disparate characters all resonate and coalesce within the centrifuge that is Mal.  Great, dynamic, excitinga and well-written series.  If you haven't seen it do yourself a favor and check it out soon.",5,Whedon intrinsically grasps that those people whom we give ourselves to in some way are a part and reflection of us.,1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,4322,"['Firefly', 'television', 'series', 'many', 'things', 'western', 'space', 'opera', 'political', 'action', 'adventure', 'pure', 'escapism', 'entertainment', 'things', 'make', 'series', 'huge', 'blast', 'watch', 'center', 'pole', 'series', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Castle', 'fame', 'Captain', 'Malcolm', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'captain', 'eponymous', 'ship', 'eight', 'other', 'significant', 'members', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'series', 'important', 'are', 'reflection', 'different', 'sides', 'man', 'who', 'Mal.First', 'officer', 'Zoe', 'Washburne', 'played', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'confederate', 'Mal', 'fellow', 'browncoat', 'who', 'fought', 'good', 'rebel', 'fight', 'lost', 'battle', 'fight', 'Mal', 'fighting', 'spirit', 'notion', 'matter', 'how', 'future', 'look', 'right', 'square', 'eyes', 'stare', 'down', 'also', 'idealism.Pilot', 'extraordinaire', 'Hoban', 'Wash', 'Washburne', 'played', 'underrated', 'actor', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'lighter', 'slice', 'life', 'married', 'Zoe', 'always', 'ready', 'see', 'world', 'sorta', 'ridiculous', 'lense', 'Mal', 'muted', 'ability', 'desire', 'relax', 'rest.Courtesan', 'Inara', 'Serra', 'played', 'dropdead', 'gorgeous', 'Morena', 'Baccarin', 'recent', 'V', 'fame', 'complicated', 'love', 'interest', 'Mal', 'torn', 'work', 'high', 'class', 'space', 'prostitute', 'essentially', 'torn', 'stoicism', 'love', 'ship', 'crew', 'versus', 'worldly', 'politically', 'savvy', 'individual', 'Mal', 'eroticism', 'philanthropic', 'love', 'would', 'go', 'ends', 'universe', 'Inara', 'would', 'rarely', 'admit', 'her.Jayne', 'Cobb', 'played', 'Baldwin', 'known', 'Adam', 'check', 'out', 'old', 'classic', 'Bodyguard', 'virtually', 'same', '20', 'years', 'later', 'immoral', 'selfish', 'brutish', 'grunt', 'crew', 'just', 'might', 'sell', 'out', 'big', 'enough', 'paycheck', 'save', 'own', 'hide', 'Mal', 'raw', 'aggression', 'desire', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'virtue', 'force', 'not', 'will.Firefly', 'technical', 'mechanical', 'expertise', 'found', 'Kaylee', 'Frye', 'played', 'youthful', 'Jewel', 'Staite', 'who', 'practically', 'one', 'ship', 'can', 'fix', 'just', 'maladies', 'also', 'wide-eyed', 'innocent', 'newly', 'blooming', 'flower', 'taking', 'world', 'around', 'believing', 'best', 'people', 'Mal', 'purity.The', 'enigmatic', 'Shepherd', 'Book', 'played', 'character', 'actor', 'Ron', 'Glass', 'little', '>', 'ahem', 'lt', 'color', 'all-white', 'cast', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'saint', 'sinners', 'more', 'know', 'more', 'know', ""n't"", 'always', 'been', 'saint', 'also', 'sage', 'able', 'dispense', 'wordly', 'spiritual', 'advice', 'repeatedly', 'Mal', 'look', 'bigger', 'picture', 'Firefly', 'version', 'God', 'not', 'well', 'developed', 'seemingly', 'close', 'Judeo-Christian', 'representation', 'Shepherd', 'Mal', 'godly', 'qualities', 'being', 'Moses/', 'shepherd', 'crew', 'also', 'spiritual', 'nature', 'tamped', 'down', 'ground', 'dirt', 'even', 'doing', 'God', 'work', 'spite', 'himself.Dr', 'Simon', 'Tam', 'played', 'Sean', 'Maher', 'aboard', 'sister', 'River', 'Tam', 'played', 'balletic', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'bid', 'help', 'brain-scrambled', 'living-weapon', 'sister', 'away', 'intergalactic', 'ruling', 'authority', 'Alliance', 'who', 'been', 'experimenting', 'turning', 'sort', 'super', 'weapon', 'Simon', 'fierce', 'righteously', 'opinionated', 'fault', 'sister', 'River', 'glyph', 'human', 'key', 'masked', 'potentials', 'human', 'feats', 'mental', 'physical', 'as', 'well', 'fractured', 'tortured', 'soul', 'storyline', 'most', 'distressing', 'maudlin', 'series', 'bring', 'series', 'down', 'notch', 'times', 'unfortunately', 'family', 'unit', 'represent', 'Mal', 'sense', 'family', 'being', 'father', 'figure', 'Individually', 'Dr.', 'Tam', 'Mal', 'single-minded', 'determination', 'River', 'Mal', 'untapped', 'potential', 'belief', 'Shepherd', 'Book', 'things', 'greater', 'himself.It', 'quite', 'compelling', 'character', 'study', 'cast', 'seemingly', 'disparate', 'characters', 'resonate', 'coalesce', 'centrifuge', 'Mal', 'Great', 'dynamic', 'excitinga', 'well-written', 'series', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'do', 'favor', 'check', 'out', 'soon']",N/A

766945,A2QSN9JTY9CLDW,B0000AQS0F,Tim Bare,"[4, 5]","Joss Whedon, the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, is a genius. In his various efforts in television and comic books, he has become a favorite of mine. So when i heard, a couple years back that is, that he was investing his formidable creative prowess in a science fiction series, I was breathless with anticipation. And of course, Whedon and his long-time partner Tim Minear did not disappoint, nor did their well-chosen, very talented cast.Firefly is a science fiction western, where 500 years in the future humanity has spread across the galaxy, united under the totalitarian Alliance and its corporate arm, Blue Sun. In the future, cultures have been melded together to come up with intriguing art, fashion, and even language (the characters swear in Chinese). Our heroes are the crew of the Firefly-class transport, Serenity. They are Malcolm Reynolds, the captain and veteran of the war between his Independent faction and the Alliance; Zoe, his first mate and fellow soldier in the war; Wash, Zoe's husband and the pilot; Jayne, an amoral thief who acts as the muscle of the group; Kaylee, the mechanic, with the ability to telepathically communicate with machines; and Inara, the resident ""companion"" (similar to courtesans or geishas) and the ship's ""ambassador"". They're renegades and thieves, taking any job that pays, but things get complicated when they pick up three interesting passengers: Shepherd Book, a preacher, Simon Tam, a former doctor, and his insane sister River, who is wanted by the Alliance.The show is very well-written and well-directed, especially with Whedon behind the camera. The cast are all incredible, but the highlight is Nathan Fillion as Reynolds, who is truly incredible on screen. But unfortunately, by the time one watches all the episodes, the arc of the season is just unfolding, and is cut short by the fat cats at fox. The good news is Whedon's doing a movie. So after watching these 14 episodes, go see the movie so you can see the story unfold.",5,One of the best sci-fi series ever to grace television,1092009600,"08 9, 2004",2004,1996,"['Joss', 'Whedon', 'creator', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'genius', 'various', 'efforts', 'television', 'comic', 'books', 'become', 'favorite', 'mine', 'when', 'i', 'heard', 'couple', 'years', 'back', 'was', 'investing', 'formidable', 'creative', 'prowess', 'science', 'fiction', 'series', 'was', 'breathless', 'anticipation', 'course', 'Whedon', 'long-time', 'partner', 'Tim', 'Minear', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'did', 'well-chosen', 'very', 'talented', 'cast.Firefly', 'science', 'fiction', 'western', 'where', '500', 'years', 'future', 'humanity', 'spread', 'galaxy', 'united', 'totalitarian', 'Alliance', 'corporate', 'arm', 'Blue', 'Sun', 'future', 'cultures', 'have', 'been', 'melded', 'together', 'come', 'up', 'intriguing', 'art', 'fashion', 'even', 'language', 'characters', 'swear', 'Chinese', 'heroes', 'are', 'crew', 'Firefly-class', 'transport', 'Serenity', 'are', 'Malcolm', 'Reynolds', 'captain', 'veteran', 'war', 'Independent', 'faction', 'Alliance', 'Zoe', 'first', 'mate', 'fellow', 'soldier', 'war', 'Wash', 'Zoe', 'husband', 'pilot', 'Jayne', 'amoral', 'thief', 'who', 'muscle', 'group', 'Kaylee', 'mechanic', 'ability', 'telepathically', 'communicate', 'machines', 'Inara', 'resident', 'companion', 'similar', 'courtesans', 'geishas', 'ship', 'ambassador', ""'re"", 'renegades', 'thieves', 'taking', 'job', 'things', 'get', 'complicated', 'when', 'pick', 'up', 'three', 'interesting', 'passengers', 'Shepherd', 'Book', 'preacher', 'Simon', 'Tam', 'former', 'doctor', 'insane', 'sister', 'River', 'who', 'wanted', 'Alliance.The', 'show', 'very', 'well-written', 'well-directed', 'especially', 'Whedon', 'camera', 'cast', 'are', 'incredible', 'highlight', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'truly', 'incredible', 'screen', 'unfortunately', 'time', 'one', 'episodes', 'arc', 'season', 'just', 'unfolding', 'cut', 'short', 'fat', 'cats', 'fox', 'good', 'news', 'Whedon', 'doing', 'movie', 'So', 'watching', '14', 'episodes', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'story', 'unfold']",N/A

Way to give it a chance Fox, I guess they needed more air-time for Man Vs. Beast or When Animals Attack # 175.  What made this sci-fi Western unique was that this was still a human show.  There were no aliens.  The Crew of the Firefly was led by Captain Mal Reynolds played by Nathan Fillion who Buffy fans will remember as the evil priest on the last few episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Other cast members included: Adam Baldwin as the mercenary Jayne Cobb, and Ron Glass of Barney Miller fame as ""Book"" a mysterious minister.  They make up the crew of the ship Serenity as the group of rogues struggles to make their way taking whatever jobs they can, which often make then less than your stereotypical heroes.  Characters is what makes a great show and Whedon knows great characters and delivers again with a fantastic ensemble cast, all perfectly suited for the varying roles they are portraying.  Not only did Fox cancel the show early, but they showed the episodes out of order from what Whedon wanted.  But hey, thank God for DVD as you get all 14 episodes in all their glory.Among my favorite episodes are:""Out of Gas""  A flashback episode that details how mal acquired the Serenity and how each of the members joined the crew.""Ariel""  The crew visit a planet called Ariel where tehy attempt to get simon into a hospital to use a machine to help River.  They pose as dead bodies and are eventually captured by the Alliance.""War Stories""  Mal and Walsh are kidnapped by Niska who wants payback for the botched train robbery in the first episode.""Serenity parts 1 & 2""  is great as well.  Given Whedon's track record it's just incredible that Fox didn't allow the show to develop.  This was really a sci-fi show for people who are not necessarily Sci-fi fans.  The backdrop was the future but this was a very human drama much the way that Buffy was and sucked in many people who were not horror fans or who were older.

In that sense, ""the wild west"" is not an unfamiliar setting for me.When I first heard about Firefly, I was suspicious about the universe Whedon created. How believeable is a place where you have spaceships and cowboys or whatever co-existing? However, I could not resist the temptation. Unfortunately, in today's movie and TV landscape original ideas are hard to come by. And Firefly is an original concept. Although the basic premises of the story is really hard to buy (horses and spaceships), the character depth, the pace and freshness of the series is strong enough to keep you pinned to your seat accross the TV.The visual effects also play a very strong role in making you believe in this universe. I am very pleased to see more and more of real world physics appearing in sci-fi movies and TV series. Explosions in space won't make sounds. And there is none. The camera actions I was so fond of in the new Battlestar Galactica are also seen here which gives more strength to the visual drama of the series.Going back to the characters, every one of them are well-developed and you like each and every one of them. I could not understand the real power of River until I watched the movie (yes, in some episodes you do see that she has special combat skills but that is just a glimpse compared to the showdown in the movie). Even Jayne gets likable sometimes. The romance between Mal and Inara and Kaylee and Simon gets in the way of the story from time to time, but I guess we need some emotion and I won't complain. I don't know how others felt but for me Shepherd Book is a very important part of the series. He introduces a healthy dose of mystery and well, ""serenity"" into the hectic pace of the Firefly. I was shocked to see what Whedon decided to do with him in the movie (don't worry I won't ruin the experience for you, just in case you haven't watched it).What is more, you see morality, the concepts of good-bad, right-wrong questioned all the time. In times of hardship, how would a decent man behave? You see some answers that you probably would have given.As a final point, I should say that I am very glad that I bought the DVD set. I wish there was more of it. I don't know if they will be able to continue the series after Serenity, but I will be here to watch it if you bring it on Mr. Whedon.",5,Firefly: Adventures in Wild Westspace,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,2415,"['do', ""n't"", 'come', 'American', 'culture', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'western', 'movies', 'Sunday', 'mornings', 'sense', 'wild', 'west', 'not', 'unfamiliar', 'setting', 'me.When', 'first', 'heard', 'Firefly', 'was', 'suspicious', 'universe', 'Whedon', 'created', 'How', 'believeable', 'place', 'where', 'have', 'spaceships', 'cowboys', 'co-existing', 'However', 'could', 'not', 'resist', 'temptation', 'Unfortunately', 'today', 'movie', 'TV', 'landscape', 'original', 'ideas', 'are', 'hard', 'come', 'Firefly', 'original', 'concept', 'basic', 'premises', 'story', 'really', 'hard', 'buy', 'horses', 'spaceships', 'character', 'depth', 'pace', 'freshness', 'series', 'strong', 'enough', 'keep', 'pinned', 'seat', 'TV.The', 'visual', 'effects', 'also', 'play', 'very', 'strong', 'role', 'making', 'believe', 'universe', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'see', 'more', 'more', 'real', 'world', 'physics', 'appearing', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'TV', 'series', 'Explosions', 'space', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'sounds', 'none', 'camera', 'actions', 'was', 'so', 'fond', 'new', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'are', 'also', 'seen', 'here', 'more', 'strength', 'visual', 'drama', 'series.Going', 'back', 'characters', 'one', 'are', 'well-developed', 'like', 'one', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'real', 'power', 'River', 'watched', 'movie', 'yes', 'episodes', 'do', 'see', 'special', 'combat', 'skills', 'just', 'glimpse', 'compared', 'showdown', 'movie', 'Even', 'Jayne', 'likable', 'sometimes', 'romance', 'Mal', 'Inara', 'Kaylee', 'Simon', 'way', 'story', 'time', 'time', 'guess', 'need', 'emotion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'complain', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'others', 'felt', 'Shepherd', 'Book', 'very', 'important', 'part', 'series', 'healthy', 'dose', 'mystery', 'well', 'serenity', 'hectic', 'pace', 'Firefly', 'was', 'shocked', 'see', 'what', 'Whedon', 'decided', 'do', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'experience', 'just', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', '.What', 'more', 'see', 'morality', 'concepts', 'good-bad', 'right-wrong', 'questioned', 'time', 'times', 'hardship', 'how', 'would', 'decent', 'man', 'behave', 'see', 'answers', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'given.As', 'final', 'point', 'should', 'say', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'bought', 'DVD', 'set', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'continue', 'series', 'Serenity', 'will', 'be', 'here', 'watch', 'bring', 'Mr.', 'Whedon']",N/A
766951,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B0000AQS0F,Tom Benton,"[5, 6]","Back in 2004, being a big fan of Joss Whedon's shows ""BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER"" and ""ANGEL"", I decided I'd better pick up his failed sci-fi series, ""FIREFLY"".  My aunt bought it for me for my birthday, and I eventually began watching it.  The pilot, ""Serenity"", runs 85 minutes and I was bored through most of it.  Why had people been talking about this?A few months later, with nothing else to do, I decided to check out the rest of the series.  Oh, boy, am I glad I did.""FIREFLY"" is one of the greatest television series ever, a true masterpiece.  It dares to go where other shows will not - something that angered television executives when it was on the air.  It's set in a distant future, where sleazy corporations run the many different worlds in the universe.  Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) captains the Firefly-class spaceship ""Serenity"", which smuggles goods across planets while running from the Alliance.  In each episode, the crew is faced with a different problem, both off and on the ship.This show is mind-blowing, absolutely and completely.  As with ""BUFFY"" and ""ANGEL"", Joss Whedon provides us with thought-out storylines, witty dialogue, and realistic characters whom we care about.  The casting is absolutely superb; each actor and actress brings their character to life perfectly.  The show is a science-fiction drama mixed with western action and grit.  Greg Edmonson's music is unique and entirely fitting; it really adds to the emotion.Though each episode is nearly the same in quality, I would say that the best episode is ""Out of Gas"", a moving look at how Mal Reynolds first met the crew that he (and we) would come to love.  ""The Message"" has received much acclaim due to its beautiful cinematography, Emmy-worthy performances and very moving script.Out of the 14 outstanding episodes the set contains, only 11 were aired before the show's cancellation.  Why?  An excuse from the network was ""viewers"".  But can the viewers be blamed?  The network placed the episodes on Friday nights (a notorious time slot) and aired them out of sequence.  The network was afraid to do anything out of the ordinary.  Instead they would rather air ""series"" like ""My Big Fat Obnoxious Husband"".  Cancelling this series was one of the worst mistakes in television history.  I'm not the first one to say that it could have been the next ""STAR TREK"".With a feature-length movie, ""SERENITY"", about to be released, two sequels being planned, and incredible DVD sales, this series will not be forgotten.  But that doesn't make its cancellation much easier to deal with.  By all means, pick up this absolutely fantastic series and show the television corporations what we REALLY want.",5,Cancelling it was one of the worst mistakes in television history,1123804800,"08 12, 2005",2005,2687,"['Back', '2004', 'being', 'big', 'fan', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'shows', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'ANGEL', 'decided', ""'d"", 'better', 'pick', 'up', 'failed', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'FIREFLY', 'aunt', 'bought', 'birthday', 'eventually', 'began', 'watching', 'pilot', 'Serenity', '85', 'minutes', 'was', 'bored', 'most', 'Why', 'had', 'people', 'been', 'talking', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'rest', 'series', 'Oh', 'boy', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'FIREFLY', 'one', 'greatest', 'television', 'series', 'ever', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'go', 'where', 'other', 'shows', 'will', 'not', 'something', 'angered', 'television', 'executives', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'set', 'distant', 'future', 'where', 'sleazy', 'corporations', 'run', 'many', 'different', 'worlds', 'universe', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Firefly-class', 'spaceship', 'Serenity', 'goods', 'planets', 'running', 'Alliance', 'episode', 'crew', 'faced', 'different', 'problem', 'off', 'ship.This', 'show', 'mind-blowing', 'absolutely', 'completely', 'BUFFY', 'ANGEL', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'thought-out', 'storylines', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'realistic', 'characters', 'whom', 'care', 'casting', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'actor', 'actress', 'brings', 'character', 'life', 'perfectly', 'show', 'science-fiction', 'drama', 'mixed', 'western', 'action', 'grit', 'Greg', 'Edmonson', 'music', 'unique', 'entirely', 'fitting', 'really', 'emotion.Though', 'episode', 'nearly', 'same', 'quality', 'would', 'say', 'best', 'episode', 'Gas', 'moving', 'look', 'how', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'first', 'met', 'crew', 'would', 'come', 'love', 'Message', 'received', 'much', 'acclaim', 'due', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Emmy-worthy', 'performances', 'very', 'moving', 'script.Out', '14', 'outstanding', 'episodes', 'set', 'contains', 'only', '11', 'were', 'aired', 'show', 'cancellation', 'Why', 'excuse', 'network', 'was', 'viewers', 'can', 'viewers', 'be', 'blamed', 'network', 'placed', 'episodes', 'Friday', 'nights', 'notorious', 'time', 'slot', 'aired', 'sequence', 'network', 'was', 'afraid', 'do', 'anything', 'ordinary', 'Instead', 'would', 'rather', 'air', 'series', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Obnoxious', 'Husband', 'Cancelling', 'series', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'mistakes', 'television', 'history', ""'m"", 'not', 'first', 'one', 'say', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'next', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'feature-length', 'movie', 'SERENITY', 'be', 'released', 'two', 'sequels', 'being', 'planned', 'incredible', 'DVD', 'sales', 'series', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', ""n't"", 'make', 'cancellation', 'much', 'easier', 'deal', 'means', 'pick', 'up', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'series', 'show', 'television', 'corporations', 'what', 'REALLY', 'want']",N/A

While the quality of the drama can come and go, I will admit a lot of the stuff revolving around river can some times be tough due to Summer Glau's not so amazing acting, the humor always works.  Even Glau pulls off the comedy which really is saying something.Fillion really makes the show.  He was destined to play this character and you can just feel the charisma rolling off the man.  He has that good guy in a not so good world thing going on, and he is as ruthless as he needs to be while still having honor.  Its the kind of personality traits you see in great characters such as the Doctor from Doctor Who.  And he really pulls it off.  He has made me a fan of his for life.The other thing that really helps this show work is the world building.  The entire universe where these characters live feels real.  The level of detail that Whedon has gone to is amazing and unlike some other shows this one feels like it is set in a living, breathing world.  And how can you not love sci-fi western.  Its a great genre that many have been trying to copy since this show came out.  Combine that with really great details, like the mixture of Chinese and English, gives the show a backdrop to play each episode off of is that extra something that really makes this show sing.Also, for sci-fi buffs out there, having a show with no sound in space is a rarity.

This show, other than it's snappy dialogue and quirky heroes, bears no relation though. It's a sci-fi western about a crew of smugglers and their prostitute boarder-a career both legal and respectable in the future-who live on the fringes of space eeking out a living on not exactly legal activities. They must hide from the goverment and the Reivers, a pack of cannibals who roam the frontier territories with faster ships and tractor magnets. As well as the occasional grudge-holding crime overlord-Captain Reynolds and the gang were an honorable lot and only criminal by necessity. The cast and acting were perfection, the plots were clever and funny and the show was original. So naturally it was doomed to fail.Every episode, including a few that never aired, are assembled for this collection. This includes the pilot. Fox skipped the pilot and aired the episodes out of order for reasons of their own (did I mention how much I hate the Fox network?)

766961,AE1OP60IC5O82,B0000AQS0F,truster38,"[13, 14]","I am a certified fan of Joss Whedon, that celluloid genius who brought us our very favorite vampire slayer.  I own all the Buffy and Angel DVDs and even read Whedon's comic book work, from Fray to the current Astonishing X-Men.  But I stayed away from Firefly when it was on the air, for much the same reason I'd never watch the original Buffy movie: I knew it was going to fail.  Just as I knew that the 1992 movie would only disappoint me, I knew that Firefly would not succeed commercially.  There was no way, in this ever-more homogenous Bush-supporting society, that a Joss Whedon show would survive on a network.  I thought that it was better to stay away than to be left with a huge gaping hole in my side after only a few episodes.  Now, after watching the DVD set of the 14 episodes that managed to be completed, I can't help but feel remorse.  Firefly, and I will take much flak from the Whedon community for saying this, is the Buffy's creator best show.  It's better than Buffy and Angel.  Buffy and Angel, while spectacular television shows, both sometimes hit snags in terms of consistency.  See Season Four of Buffy and Season One of Angel for further details.  This is because, while those shows were the product of a concept, a cool, flash-in-the-pan idea that Whedon's mind hatched, Firefly is the show he has always wanted to make.  Every frame and every line of dialogue is the realization of a talented filmmaker's ultimate wet dream.  You get the feeling that Whedon imagined every single aspect of Firefly long before he ever started typing on his iBook.  This is a fantastic show.  It is an absolutely complete body of work, although it's only 14 episodes long.  Firefly is Whedon's love letter to all of his influences, from sci-fi to westerns to good old character-driven drama.  The cast and crew coalesce to help Whedon achieve his vision and are all fantastic.  The way the show is shot and lighted give the viewer a very obvious visual clue about the show's message: history always repeats itself.  Nothing ever really changes and people should stop mistaking technological advancements for true human evolution.  I love the zooms and the &quot;imperfect&quot; special effects style, complete with lens flares, poor lighting in places, and various other supposed no-no's.  The staff, which included familiar faces Tim Minear and Jane Espenson, are of course reliably brilliant.  The sets, by old Buffy alum Carey Meyer, really betray the show's budget with a very real sense of space (especially the ship).  There's also the actors, who I think are just an amazing group of nine very individual talents.  Nathan Fillion exudes both confidence and hopelessness in every scene and is hilarious when paired with &quot;Saffron,&quot; the recurring con artist played by Christina Hendricks.  The &quot;strong woman-chicken&quot; couple played by Gina Torres and Alan Tudyk drive both actors to play each scene to the nines, although I wish we would have seen more of their very complex yet beautiful relationship.  Adam Baldwin is perhaps my favorite as Jayne Cobb, the beefy action hero who is despicable but also very much a man-child.  Ron Glass is the definition of dignity as Shephard Book, whose mysterious past would have been one of the juicest plot lines had the show been allowed to continue.  Sean Maher and Summer Glau share a kind of sibling love that is so realistic, with Maher taking the role of the ship doctor beyond the confines of any Trek.  Glau, in her first substantial acting role, makes Brittany Murphy look like a hack with a truly difficult character that she nails consistently.  Morena Baccarin, in the role of companion Inara, demonstrates a truly complex feminine strength that is rarely seen on a landscape littered with Bachelorettes.  Finally, there is Jewel Staite, who never confuses innocence with stupidity and brought much-needed heart to the show.  Favorite episodes include &quot;Serenity,&quot; the intended pilot, the hilarious &quot;Jaynestown&quot; and &quot;The Message,&quot; which gives the term plot twist a new meaning.  &quot;Out Of Gas,&quot; however, might just be the finest hour of television I've ever seen.  With a movie due out spring of next year, here's to hoping that all the bottom-line obsessed suits will not &quot;take the sky&quot; from us.",5,Our Mr. Whedon,1087948800,"06 23, 2004",2004,4331,"['am', 'certified', 'fan', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'celluloid', 'genius', 'who', 'brought', 'very', 'favorite', 'vampire', 'slayer', 'own', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'DVDs', 'even', 'read', 'Whedon', 'comic', 'book', 'work', 'Fray', 'current', 'Astonishing', 'X-Men', 'stayed', 'away', 'Firefly', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'much', 'same', 'reason', ""'d"", 'never', 'watch', 'original', 'Buffy', 'movie', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'fail', 'Just', 'knew', '1992', 'movie', 'would', 'only', 'disappoint', 'knew', 'Firefly', 'would', 'not', 'succeed', 'commercially', 'was', 'way', 'ever-more', 'homogenous', 'Bush-supporting', 'society', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'show', 'would', 'survive', 'network', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'stay', 'away', 'be', 'left', 'huge', 'gaping', 'hole', 'side', 'only', 'few', 'episodes', 'Now', 'watching', 'DVD', 'set', '14', 'episodes', 'managed', 'be', 'completed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'remorse', 'Firefly', 'will', 'take', 'much', 'flak', 'Whedon', 'community', 'saying', 'Buffy', 'creator', 'best', 'show', 'better', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'spectacular', 'television', 'shows', 'sometimes', 'hit', 'snags', 'terms', 'consistency', 'See', 'Season', 'Four', 'Buffy', 'Season', 'One', 'Angel', 'further', 'details', 'because', 'shows', 'were', 'product', 'concept', 'cool', 'flash-in-the-pan', 'idea', 'Whedon', 'mind', 'hatched', 'Firefly', 'show', 'always', 'wanted', 'make', 'frame', 'line', 'dialogue', 'realization', 'talented', 'filmmaker', 'ultimate', 'wet', 'dream', 'get', 'feeling', 'Whedon', 'imagined', 'single', 'aspect', 'Firefly', 'long', 'ever', 'started', 'typing', 'iBook', 'fantastic', 'show', 'absolutely', 'complete', 'body', 'work', 'only', '14', 'episodes', 'long', 'Firefly', 'Whedon', 'love', 'letter', 'influences', 'sci-fi', 'westerns', 'good', 'old', 'character-driven', 'drama', 'cast', 'crew', 'coalesce', 'help', 'Whedon', 'achieve', 'vision', 'are', 'fantastic', 'way', 'show', 'shot', 'lighted', 'give', 'viewer', 'very', 'obvious', 'visual', 'clue', 'show', 'message', 'history', 'always', 'Nothing', 'ever', 'really', 'changes', 'people', 'should', 'stop', 'mistaking', 'technological', 'advancements', 'true', 'human', 'evolution', 'love', 'zooms', 'quot', 'imperfect', 'quot', 'special', 'effects', 'style', 'complete', 'lens', 'flares', 'poor', 'lighting', 'places', 'various', 'other', 'supposed', 'no-no', 'staff', 'included', 'familiar', 'Tim', 'Minear', 'Jane', 'Espenson', 'are', 'course', 'reliably', 'brilliant', 'sets', 'old', 'Buffy', 'alum', 'Carey', 'Meyer', 'really', 'show', 'budget', 'very', 'real', 'sense', 'space', 'especially', 'ship', 'also', 'actors', 'who', 'think', 'are', 'just', 'amazing', 'group', 'nine', 'very', 'individual', 'talents', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'confidence', 'hopelessness', 'scene', 'hilarious', 'when', 'paired', 'quot', 'Saffron', 'quot', 'recurring', 'con', 'artist', 'played', 'Christina', 'Hendricks', 'quot', 'strong', 'woman-chicken', 'quot', 'couple', 'played', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'drive', 'actors', 'play', 'scene', 'nines', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'very', 'complex', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'relationship', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'perhaps', 'favorite', 'Jayne', 'Cobb', 'beefy', 'action', 'hero', 'who', 'despicable', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'man-child', 'Ron', 'Glass', 'definition', 'dignity', 'Shephard', 'Book', 'mysterious', 'past', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'juicest', 'plot', 'lines', 'had', 'show', 'been', 'allowed', 'continue', 'Sean', 'Maher', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'share', 'kind', 'sibling', 'love', 'so', 'realistic', 'Maher', 'taking', 'role', 'ship', 'doctor', 'confines', 'Trek', 'Glau', 'first', 'substantial', 'acting', 'role', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'look', 'hack', 'truly', 'difficult', 'character', 'consistently', 'Morena', 'Baccarin', 'role', 'companion', 'Inara', 'truly', 'complex', 'feminine', 'strength', 'rarely', 'seen', 'landscape', 'littered', 'Bachelorettes', 'Finally', 'Jewel', 'Staite', 'who', 'never', 'innocence', 'stupidity', 'brought', 'much-needed', 'heart', 'show', 'Favorite', 'include', 'quot', 'Serenity', 'quot', 'intended', 'pilot', 'hilarious', 'quot', 'Jaynestown', 'quot', 'quot', 'Message', 'quot', 'term', 'plot', 'twist', 'new', 'meaning', 'quot', 'Out', 'Gas', 'quot', 'however', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'finest', 'hour', 'television', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'due', 'spring', 'next', 'year', 'here', 'hoping', 'bottom-line', 'obsessed', 'suits', 'will', 'not', 'quot', 'take', 'sky', 'quot']",N/A

The characters were intelligent and all had foibles and weaknesses.  The plot was straight-forward, but with enough twists and turns to keep your mind focused.  The storytelling, however was outstanding. It was effective and purposeful, without a wasted scene.  In other words, the story felt real.So, the day after seeing the movie, I bought the Firefly collection.  The show is even better than the movie.  Some may find the western/cowboy slang ridiculous or may feel the fusion of western/scifi to be silly.For me, I get what Joss Wheldon was trying to say.  The future won't be nice and rosy ala Star Trek.  It could be grim and hard for many people and a return to previous ways of existence - the gun in this case (and the sword in even earlier times), may prove necessary.  Once the luxury of civilization is stripped from settlers on a very rough frontier, previous means of survival and living can take over.So, cowboy justice; not trusting strangers; slavery; indentured labor-all of these may be seen.  But despite these hurdles, the characters in Firefly are a family.  They bond only with one another and strangers don't automatically earn their charity.  They are often cruel with one another as only family can be.  They are uncaring of others' misery and engage in willful blindness to some of the damage that their actions bring upon others.  Despite these flaws, they still do the best they can for themselves and when forced to confront the evil all around them, they rise to the challenge and offer up all that they have.Their stories are set in an epic setting -  a space operatic milieu - but their actions are highly personal, discrete, and limited.  They aren't out to save the universe; just one another.  Their stories are believable and true because we can all envision ourselves in the crew's place and acting similarly.  This is so refreshing after the 3 deadly dull Star Wars movies and the impotent, utopian, flailing of Star Trek.I am passionate about this show, and I would love to see sequels to the movie, or even better, direct-to-DVD episodes.",5,A Tragic Loss,1129939200,"10 22, 2005",2005,2194,"['never', 'saw', 'series', 'when', 'aired', 'wish', 'had', 'saw', 'movie', 'Serenity', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'characters', 'were', 'intelligent', 'had', 'foibles', 'weaknesses', 'plot', 'was', 'straight-forward', 'enough', 'twists', 'keep', 'mind', 'focused', 'storytelling', 'however', 'was', 'outstanding', 'was', 'effective', 'purposeful', 'wasted', 'scene', 'other', 'words', 'story', 'felt', 'real.So', 'day', 'seeing', 'movie', 'bought', 'Firefly', 'collection', 'show', 'even', 'better', 'movie', 'may', 'find', 'western/cowboy', 'ridiculous', 'may', 'feel', 'fusion', 'western/scifi', 'be', 'silly.For', 'get', 'what', 'Joss', 'Wheldon', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'future', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'nice', 'rosy', 'ala', 'Star', 'Trek', 'could', 'be', 'grim', 'hard', 'many', 'people', 'return', 'previous', 'ways', 'existence', 'gun', 'case', 'sword', 'even', 'earlier', 'times', 'may', 'prove', 'necessary', 'luxury', 'civilization', 'stripped', 'settlers', 'very', 'rough', 'frontier', 'previous', 'means', 'survival', 'living', 'can', 'take', 'over.So', 'cowboy', 'justice', 'not', 'trusting', 'strangers', 'slavery', 'indentured', 'labor-all', 'may', 'be', 'seen', 'hurdles', 'characters', 'Firefly', 'are', 'family', 'bond', 'only', 'one', 'strangers', 'do', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'earn', 'charity', 'are', 'often', 'cruel', 'one', 'only', 'family', 'can', 'be', 'are', 'uncaring', 'others', 'misery', 'engage', 'willful', 'blindness', 'damage', 'actions', 'bring', 'others', 'flaws', 'still', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'when', 'forced', 'confront', 'evil', 'rise', 'challenge', 'offer', 'up', 'have.Their', 'stories', 'are', 'set', 'epic', 'setting', 'space', 'operatic', 'milieu', 'actions', 'are', 'highly', 'personal', 'discrete', 'limited', 'are', ""n't"", 'save', 'universe', 'just', 'one', 'stories', 'are', 'believable', 'true', 'can', 'envision', 'crew', 'place', 'acting', 'similarly', 'so', 'refreshing', '3', 'deadly', 'dull', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movies', 'impotent', 'utopian', 'flailing', 'Star', 'Trek.I', 'am', 'passionate', 'show', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'sequels', 'movie', 'even', 'better', 'direct-to-DVD', 'episodes']",N/A

Sometimes it's hard for me to catch TV shows in the evening though, since I teach at two colleges and usually am gone several nights a week.  However, when one of my students (also a Buffy fan) offered to let me preview her Firefly collection, I jumped at the chance.  I was really going in cold, not knowing much about the series.I started watching wioth the pilot episode.  I recognized some faces from Buffy/Angel - and there were some new ones.  I kept watching - about 10 or 15 minutes into it, I was going to leave and watch something else, when I was suddenly caught, riveted.  For the rest of the week, I fell headlong into the story, watched it through, then sat down and watched it again, roping as many of my family members in to watch with me as I could.Joss creates this world filled with funny, lovable, fallable, wonderful characters.  They lapse from English into Chinese and back again at the drop of a hat.  They have created a family aboard a space-going ship, firefly class, named ""Serenity.""

This montage is a documentary in itself, about a heroic group of artists struggling with their hope and grief in the face of heartless decisions by evil television executives.But the extra features also give tidbits of information which just make the show that much more enjoyable.  For example:  the camera work was intentionally jerky in places because the aim was to reproduce the cinematic values of the old tv westerns rather than the slick, overproduced space shows we've seen of late.  Joss Whedon's aim was to give it a Western feel--and it works.It works because of the characters.  Though the episodes are occasionally reminiscent of Star Trek (juiced up with that cast-iron Whedon humor), the cast of nine work to make this truly an ensemble production.  And this is not your typical roundup of characters.There is the manly captain, the ass-kicking female warrior, the Xander-like tongue-in-cheek pilot, the suspiciously sophisticated missionary, the handsome fugitive doctor, the rough-and-ready ship's man, the wise harlot, and the mesmerizingly cheerful engineer.  Perhaps the most captivating is River, a teenaged girl who exhibits symptoms of schizophrenia after her super-genius brain has been experimented on by the government.  To what purpose remains unclear, since the show was cancelled.The show may not have been cancelled, but the story lives on in Whedon's _Serenity_, a movie slated to come out in the summer of 2005.

I say that to express that I can't be considered part of his ""cult"" as some reviewers have insisted everyone giving this show a positive review must be.  I'm just a fan of science fiction, and I think Firefly is cool science fiction.I'd like to address a couple of the complaints that have been promienent:True, there are no aliens.  But so what?  Someone dares to consider that we might not have encountered aliens 500 years in the future, and they're not doing sci-fi?  That's silly.  Most current sci-fi has tended to only use aliens because they can't write interesting characters.  'Let's dress someone up to look odd and people won't notice they don't have much going on in character development.'  I'll take an all human cast if it works, and in this case it does.True, it is very western.  So what?  It's the frontier.  Is it hard to believe that humans will still be humans 500 years from now?  You've been watching too much Star Trek if you thinking flying around in space is going to magically change the human race.  And besides, this is a future that is LIVED IN.  It's not septic at all, it's a real place.Finally, consider that virtually every negative review given was by someone who admits that they never watched more than one or two episodes.  How can you possibly judge a show by one ep?  That's like watching a random ten minutes of a movie and trying to review it.  You can't consider yourself a good judge of quality based on such a short amount of exposure.This show was a fine work.  It's not perfect but it's enjoyable.  The writing is usually sharp and the story is very human.

Regarding that, there's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said.What I'm rating-- and for which I'm giving one star-- is the adaptation to BluRay.I have purchased the original DVD set, the original release of Serenity, the Serenity DVD Collector's edition, and the Serenity BluRay Collector's edition.  So when I purchased the BluRay Series Collector's Edition I expected something special.  However, the only thing shiney about the BluRay version of the series is the mirror-side of the discs.This is unfortunately, one of the few BluRay releases where I can honestly say the DVD release was better.  I can watch the DVD release in my UpConvert BluRay player and get splendid quality.  However, when I play the BluRay version the picture is grainy to the point of annoyance.I do realize that part of the series was shot in a grainy manner on purpose and have made allowance for that.  But this entire release is grainy all the way through.  Why this is the case I cannot fathom.  Was Firefly released prior to the release of HiDef television?  Was it shot in the old 800x400 standard and therefore did not transfer well to BluRay?  Did someone at the factory not know what s/he was doing, deciding to do a straight-from-DVD conversion without UpConvert standards... or perhaps attempting to push it to BluRay quality and unfortunately resulting with an extremely grainy picture?  I don't know.All I know is that most BluRay movies I've seen I can see the pores on the actor's chin in a close-up shot.  In this release a closeup shot looks like someone Photoshopped the faces with a splatterbrush effect.I am sorry to see that this series was treated with such poor rendition in the BluRay version.  And while this is a recommendation I seldom give:  for those who have not yet purchased this set, I would most definitely recommend the DVD version instead.",1,"Rating the BluRay release, not the series itself",1300060800,"03 14, 2011",2011,1916,"['Most', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'here', 'were', 'series', 'Regarding', 'nothing', 'can', 'say', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said.What', ""'m"", 'rating', ""'m"", 'giving', 'one', 'star', 'adaptation', 'BluRay.I', 'have', 'purchased', 'original', 'DVD', 'set', 'original', 'release', 'Serenity', 'Serenity', 'DVD', 'Collector', 'edition', 'Serenity', 'BluRay', 'Collector', 'edition', 'when', 'purchased', 'BluRay', 'Series', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'expected', 'something', 'special', 'However', 'only', 'thing', 'shiney', 'BluRay', 'version', 'series', 'mirror-side', 'discs.This', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'few', 'BluRay', 'where', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'DVD', 'release', 'was', 'better', 'can', 'watch', 'DVD', 'release', 'UpConvert', 'BluRay', 'player', 'get', 'splendid', 'quality', 'However', 'when', 'play', 'BluRay', 'version', 'picture', 'grainy', 'point', 'annoyance.I', 'do', 'realize', 'part', 'series', 'was', 'shot', 'grainy', 'manner', 'purpose', 'have', 'made', 'allowance', 'entire', 'release', 'grainy', 'way', 'Why', 'case', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'Was', 'Firefly', 'released', 'prior', 'release', 'HiDef', 'television', 'Was', 'shot', 'old', '800x400', 'standard', 'therefore', 'did', 'not', 'transfer', 'well', 'BluRay', 'Did', 'someone', 'factory', 'not', 'know', 'what', 's/he', 'was', 'doing', 'deciding', 'do', 'straight-from-DVD', 'conversion', 'UpConvert', 'standards', 'perhaps', 'attempting', 'push', 'BluRay', 'quality', 'unfortunately', 'resulting', 'extremely', 'grainy', 'picture', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.All', 'know', 'most', 'BluRay', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'can', 'see', 'pores', 'actor', 'chin', 'close-up', 'shot', 'release', 'closeup', 'shot', 'someone', 'Photoshopped', 'splatterbrush', 'effect.I', 'am', 'sorry', 'see', 'series', 'was', 'treated', 'such', 'poor', 'rendition', 'BluRay', 'version', 'recommendation', 'seldom', 'give', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'purchased', 'set', 'would', 'most', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'version', 'instead']",N/A

766993,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0000AQS0F,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[8, 9]","Firefly was much maligned when it was first aired. Critics savaged it which, in retrospect, seems highly unfair. They were expecting Buffy in outer space and what Josh Whedon gave them was an update of Wagon Train to the stars (or what Star Trek might have been if the franchise hadn't become stuffy over time). Firefly showed great potential which is precisely why Fox gunned it down; Fox the network that once let dark horse series find an audience became as conversative and musty as CBS.In the two hour pilot we're introduced to the basic concept of the series; five centuries have passed. There's been a civil war. Our heroes were on the losing side and now making a living  carrying illegal and legal merchandise. They're not bad guys and have a code of honor not too dissimilar to the code of gunfighters in the old west. The characters are appealing, interesting and well played by the cast.Fox's miscalculation is, in one sense, the fan's gain; evidently Whedon is planning a film at some point in the future. It's just as well as Firefly was too clever and intelligent for Fox and most of the viewers and critics that caught the show all too briefly in its 11 episode run. The DVD picture and sound quality is very, very good. The extras include a gag reel, featurette, screen test and commentaries on a number of episodes.The big bonus, though, is the inclusion of 3 never before seen episodes of the series that didn't air after it was canceled. I'm surprised that Sci-Fi Channel didn't pick this up (but then again Sci-Fi usually demands a portion of ownership now prior to agreeing to run a series--a factor that probably played into the remake of Battlestar: Galatica). It's a pity that Sci-Fi chose to remake Battlestar:Galatica vs. continuing this fine series. A number of questionable choices have been made at both networks although the cancelation of Firefly without giving the series a fair chance was probably Fox's biggest blunder for new shows of the 2002 season.In reinventing the space opera, Whedon crafted a terrific, intelligent and well written series.

The CGI special effects are very well done, but mostly limited to external views of the ship.  They are used sparingly and there are no space battle scenes to speak of.  The ship itself is very believable, in the same way that the Nostromo (Alien) was:  it looks worn, lived-in and patched together.  In short it looks like a typical big piece of machinery, not an oversized plastic toy.Firefly is concerned with the relationship of humans on poor frontier planets to a central government.  So it opts for a Wild-West theme which is long on atmosphere and realism but short on flashy gadgets. The frequent use of Chinese hints at some interesting political history as well...Beyond the unexpectedly good production quality, the crew is what really makes the series.  Each has his/her own quirks and each episode gives you some more insight into what makes them tick.  My personal favorite being Jayne, as he is such a dumb moron.  There might be a good side to him, somewhere, but the series goes out of its way to always knock him off his pedestal whenever you start to like him.  Oh, and Kaylee is a real hottie!Other reviewers have already written about the depth and subversive nature of the main plotline so there is no need to repeat those points.",5,Wow!,1134777600,"12 17, 2005",2005,2024,"['Much', 'much', 'better', 'expected', '5', 'star', 'rating', '1800+', 'folks', 'raise', 'expectations', 'bit', 'background', 'love', 'SciFi', 'more', 'so', 'books', 'films', 'have', 'especially', 'low', 'expectations', 'TV', 'series', 'see', 'favorite', 'genre', 'get', 'mangled', 'time', 'time', 'humanoid', 'aliens', 'look', 'made-up', 'humans', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'fake-looking', 'sets', 'worst', 'bad', 'plots', 'rely', 'techy', 'pseudo-babble', 'spoofed', 'GalaxyQuest', 'Good', 'SF', 'films', 'can', 'overcome', 'problems', 'long', 'term', 'TV', 'series', 'always', 'seem', 'lack', 'budget', 'and/or', 'good', 'screenplays.But', 'having', 'liked', 'Serenity-the-movie', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'figured', ""'d"", 'give', 'Firefly-the-series', 'try.Firefly', 'was', 'amazingly', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'mostly', 'limited', 'external', 'views', 'ship', 'are', 'used', 'sparingly', 'are', 'space', 'battle', 'scenes', 'speak', 'ship', 'very', 'believable', 'same', 'way', 'Nostromo', 'Alien', 'was', 'worn', 'lived-in', 'patched', 'together', 'short', 'typical', 'big', 'piece', 'machinery', 'not', 'oversized', 'plastic', 'toy.Firefly', 'concerned', 'relationship', 'humans', 'poor', 'frontier', 'planets', 'central', 'government', 'Wild-West', 'theme', 'long', 'atmosphere', 'realism', 'short', 'flashy', 'gadgets', 'frequent', 'use', 'Chinese', 'hints', 'interesting', 'political', 'history', 'as', 'well', 'unexpectedly', 'good', 'production', 'quality', 'crew', 'what', 'really', 'series', 'his/her', 'own', 'quirks', 'episode', 'more', 'insight', 'what', 'tick', 'My', 'personal', 'favorite', 'being', 'Jayne', 'such', 'dumb', 'moron', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'side', 'somewhere', 'series', 'way', 'always', 'knock', 'off', 'pedestal', 'whenever', 'start', 'like', 'Oh', 'Kaylee', 'real', 'hottie', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'written', 'depth', 'subversive', 'nature', 'main', 'plotline', 'need', 'repeat', 'points']",N/A

I think I saw maybe half of one episode before it got cancelled.  Man, if I could have that to do over again... Firefly is an awesome series.  Like all classic shows (particularly sci-fi) it is a bit inaccessible at first, as you're bombarded with images, characters, plots, and roles that come at you from dizzying angles and without immediate resolution.  However, that chaos eventually becomes Firefly's great strength, which sadly is only evident over the long term.  Firefly is what I wish the new Star Wars movies had been:  long on character development, full of style, and never quite what it seems.  Just when you think you have each character, from the taciturn but loveable captain to the beautiful Companion to the surly thug figured out, they do something to throw a wrench in it and make you start over nearly from scratch.I know now that I largely missed out - not really on the episodes as I have the DVDs - but on the chance of doing my small part to keep it from getting cancelled.  However, thanks to the glory of the Internet and of DVD sales, we're soon to get a Firefly movie, 'Serenity', and perhaps, just perhaps, with some luck and a network executive with a spine, a reprise of the show.  Firefly deserves so much better than how it was treated, and the legions of loyal fans (cultish tendency to refer to one another as 'Browncoats' aside) are a testament to that.

767020,AP3B615GM191G,B0000AQS0F,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","As a fan of TV dramas in general (and science fiction in specific), I had always wondered what ""all the fuss"" was about ""Firefly"" and the furious reaction to its cancellation.  As I began watching the show, it slowly began to grow on me.  By the end, I understood.For a basic plot summary, ""Firefly"" describes a dark future in which the planets have all fallen under a centralized, government-controlled rule.  There are some on the fringes of the galaxy, however, who resist, and smuggling-ship captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) is one of them.  Along with first mate Zoe (Gina Torres), tough guy Jayne (Adam Baldwin) pilot Wash (Alan Tudyk), and engineer Kaylee (Jewel Staite), Mal survives by ""doing jobs"" for various un-sundry parties.  As the opening voice-over states, Mal ""doesn't much care what they are"", as long as they pay him enough to keep his ship in the sky.  Along the way, Mal and Co. pick up a religious Sheperd Book (Ron Glass), a high-class prostitute companion Inara (Morena Baccarin), doctor Simon Tam (Sean Maher), and the doc's crazy sister River (Summer Glau), who the authorities are always after.It took me a few episodes to really ""get"" this show, as the premise is quite strange.  It is basically a ""space western"" created by Joss Whedon, and what are all westerns truly about at heart...the characters!  The first few episodes feature quite a bit of gun-play and swashbuckling from the cast and thus it takes some time for the characters themselves to become flesh-out.  Once that happens, though, each character becomes quite ""real"" and easy to get emotionally attached to.  A great ensemble cast, to be sure.  At first, I wasn't too comfortable with Fillion as the lead (I'm always so used to seeing him as the ""stuffed shirt"" type), but even he grew on me.It truly was a shame that the FOX network did such a disservice to such a great concept and group of characters.  Not only was the series advertised all wrong and pre-empted seemingly every night by sporting events in the fall, but it also was aired out-of-order and forced to include ""mythology"" elements to make it more X-Files-ish.  Basically, the FOX execs out-thought themselves on this one.  Had they just given Whedon a little bit more play on the leash, ""Firefly"" could have been a great franchise, I think.  As it is, now the title ""cult classic"" better applies to the 14-episode run.  Very similar parallels to a later FOX show in ""Fringe"", although that show survived longer because of the JJ Abrams brand.Overall, I very much enjoyed the ""Firefly"" series, short as it was.  The characters really grew on me as I kept watching and I truly feel as if I could have watched many more episodes of this type of drama.  There are better TV dramas to be had, admittedly, but this one is still better than most.  The show's abrupt and unsettling cancellation is just proof that justice isn't always served.

Yet, even with the early abridgement, I cannot fathom how this show could not have performed better. It is full of not only quirkly, fun ideas, but extremely well written with an interesting premise.One cannot say this is the type of show anyone &quot;expected&quot;, but it should come as no surprise that creator Joss Wheldon gave birth to another series full of solid scripts, quotable quotes, and unforgettable characters. The actors do a tremendous job with potraying the chemistry (and sometimes lack thereof) of a small group of adventurers, but they have certainly been set up for success by Wheldon. There will be those who snort and say you can't really find any sort of depth in a space western, but those same people probably are shocked to find credible philosophical works being written on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.I'm sure most of us fans who have sniffed out this boxed set can agree Fox dumped this one far too soon.

With a Firefly movie in the works, and such series as Family Guy resuscitated due to strong DVD sales, can a Firefly revival be far behind?",5,Too Good to Be Gone!,1090108800,"07 18, 2004",2004,1238,"['tragedy', 'Firefly', 'pilot', 'being', 'cut', 'exciting', 'two-hour', 'premiere', 'different', 'one-hour', 'episode', 'already', 'been', 'widely', 'lamented', 'even', 'early', 'abridgement', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'how', 'show', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'performed', 'better', 'full', 'not', 'only', 'quirkly', 'fun', 'ideas', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'interesting', 'premise.One', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'type', 'show', 'anyone', 'quot', 'expected', 'quot', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'creator', 'Joss', 'Wheldon', 'gave', 'birth', 'series', 'full', 'solid', 'scripts', 'quotable', 'quotes', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'actors', 'do', 'tremendous', 'job', 'potraying', 'chemistry', 'sometimes', 'lack', 'thereof', 'small', 'group', 'adventurers', 'have', 'certainly', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'success', 'Wheldon', 'will', 'be', 'who', 'snort', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'sort', 'depth', 'space', 'western', 'same', 'people', 'probably', 'are', 'shocked', 'find', 'credible', 'philosophical', 'works', 'being', 'written', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'sniffed', 'out', 'boxed', 'set', 'can', 'agree', 'Fox', 'dumped', 'one', 'far', 'too', 'soon', 'collective', 'solace', 'Firefly', 'movie', 'works', 'such', 'series', 'Family', 'Guy', 'resuscitated', 'due', 'strong', 'DVD', 'sales', 'can', 'Firefly', 'revival', 'be', 'far']",N/A

Its one of those series that I enjoy every time I watch it (Amazon Prime).  The story for those who never watched firefly is futuristic and the &#34;hero&#34; is like a futuristic John Wayne (just thought of that).  Each one of the story's characters has a unique blend of good and bad with humor.
