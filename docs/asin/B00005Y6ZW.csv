689268,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005Y6ZW,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Perhaps the movie writers wanted to put a spin on the classic ""babysitter gets into trouble"" storyline, but then again, maybe it's all just a trick by the writers to get teens to watch what more often than not morphs into strong sexual content.It's about Alicia Silverstone's character playing the role of a babysitter.  Well... what happens next caught me by surprise, and not in a positive way either.From here, we're introduced to 3 different men who obviously want in Alicia's pants VERY badly.The first one is apparently her nerdy boyfriend who isn't on the best terms with Alicia at the moment (hence the reason she needs time away from him), a greasy-haired arrogant punk who hangs around the nerdy boyfriend and attempts to befriend him ONLY because he too wants in Alicia's pants, and the father of the kids Alicia is babysitting who goes to a party and fantasizes about Alicia while drunk.The ENTIRE MOVIE is nothing but a HUGE sexual fantasy involving the 3 characters I mention above and the many different ways they'd like to have sex with the poor, vulnerable babysitter.  Everything from making out with Alicia in the bathtub, to thinking about Alicia getting caught making out with another man and having her be punished as a result, to... *anything* that involves sex or making out.  It's honestly quite disturbing, not to mention doesn't exactly make for quality storytelling, hence the 3 stars out of 5 I'm giving the film.If that's not bad enough, later on even MORE characters fantasize about Alicia!  Yes she's an attractive girl but come on, this is borderline pathetic.  Of course the BIGGEST problem here is that it's hard to tell the difference between what is fantasy and what is really occuring.  Many times it's confusing figuring out the difference between the two.Overall, it's not much of a movie to be perfectly honest, because one sexual fantasy leading into another is not really compelling enough to recommend, however I suppose we can look at it from another perspective and realize that the movie writers were probably going for a slight spin on the typical babysitter storyline so... still, the final result is a mediocre movie.",3,more odd than anything else,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,2167,"['Perhaps', 'movie', 'writers', 'wanted', 'put', 'spin', 'classic', 'babysitter', 'trouble', 'storyline', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'just', 'trick', 'writers', 'get', 'teens', 'watch', 'what', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'morphs', 'strong', 'sexual', 'content.It', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'character', 'playing', 'role', 'babysitter', 'Well', 'what', 'next', 'caught', 'surprise', 'not', 'positive', 'way', 'here', ""'re"", 'introduced', '3', 'different', 'men', 'who', 'obviously', 'want', 'Alicia', 'pants', 'VERY', 'badly.The', 'first', 'one', 'apparently', 'nerdy', 'boyfriend', 'who', ""n't"", 'best', 'terms', 'Alicia', 'moment', 'hence', 'reason', 'time', 'away', 'greasy-haired', 'arrogant', 'punk', 'who', 'nerdy', 'boyfriend', 'attempts', 'befriend', 'ONLY', 'too', 'Alicia', 'pants', 'father', 'kids', 'Alicia', 'babysitting', 'who', 'party', 'Alicia', 'drunk.The', 'ENTIRE', 'MOVIE', 'nothing', 'HUGE', 'sexual', 'fantasy', 'involving', '3', 'characters', 'mention', 'many', 'different', 'ways', ""'d"", 'like', 'have', 'sex', 'poor', 'vulnerable', 'babysitter', 'Everything', 'making', 'out', 'Alicia', 'bathtub', 'thinking', 'Alicia', 'getting', 'caught', 'making', 'out', 'man', 'having', 'be', 'punished', 'result', '*anything*', 'sex', 'making', 'out', 'honestly', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'not', 'mention', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'make', 'quality', 'storytelling', 'hence', '3', 'stars', '5', ""'m"", 'giving', 'film.If', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', 'later', 'even', 'MORE', 'characters', 'fantasize', 'Alicia', 'Yes', 'attractive', 'girl', 'come', 'borderline', 'pathetic', 'course', 'BIGGEST', 'problem', 'here', 'hard', 'tell', 'difference', 'what', 'fantasy', 'what', 'really', 'occuring', 'Many', 'times', 'confusing', 'figuring', 'out', 'difference', 'two.Overall', 'not', 'much', 'movie', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'one', 'sexual', 'fantasy', 'leading', 'not', 'really', 'compelling', 'enough', 'recommend', 'however', 'suppose', 'can', 'look', 'perspective', 'realize', 'movie', 'writers', 'were', 'probably', 'going', 'slight', 'spin', 'typical', 'babysitter', 'storyline', 'still', 'final', 'result', 'mediocre', 'movie']",N/A

The beauty of the story was its ambiguity and the way truth and fantasy seamlessly blended into each other until the reader is left completely unable to discern between reality and fantasy.While this film adaptation blends the characters' fantasies with reality, it ultimately settles on a solid reality for its ending.The other problem that many viewers may have is that there really isn't a whole lot that happens in the film, and while this is directly from the story, it doesn't make for much of a cinematic experience.Ultimately, this is probably for two groups of people: hardcore Alicia Silverstone fans (her performance in the film is decent) and hardcore Robert Coover fans (there have to be some others out there).

That is pretty much the initial plot; the rest is bunch of fantasies from different men who want to be with her. As mentioned earlier every movie has its strength and weakens and in this case it's weakness is plot development. The story never really reaches its point it just simply jumps from a scenario in which Jennifer is babysitting and answering calls to ludicrous dream world where her seductive look captivates them. Sure enough the movie does have some good moments such as the baby sitter's boyfriend being convinced by a wrong source that she is cheating on him. This of course leads him to investigate and stock our fellow protagonist ""the babysitter"". But ultimately the good moments are once again ruined by the painfully boring and simply stupid fantasy scenes. i only recommend it if you're a fan of Alicia Silverstone's work other than that pass it.MY PERSONAL RATING: 2 OUT OF 5",2,Okay Story Ruined By Poor Plot Development,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,1195,"['movie', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'be', 'plot', 'special', 'effects', 'etc', 'film', 'have', 'semi-', 'interesting', 'plot', 'young', 'babysitter', 'named', 'Jennifer', 'played', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'day', 'going', 'school', 'course', 'end', 'babysitting', 'night', 'pretty', 'much', 'initial', 'plot', 'rest', 'bunch', 'fantasies', 'different', 'men', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'movie', 'strength', 'weakens', 'case', 'weakness', 'plot', 'development', 'story', 'never', 'really', 'point', 'just', 'simply', 'scenario', 'Jennifer', 'babysitting', 'answering', 'calls', 'ludicrous', 'dream', 'world', 'where', 'seductive', 'look', 'Sure', 'enough', 'movie', 'have', 'good', 'moments', 'such', 'baby', 'sitter', 'boyfriend', 'being', 'convinced', 'wrong', 'source', 'cheating', 'course', 'investigate', 'stock', 'fellow', 'protagonist', 'babysitter', 'ultimately', 'good', 'moments', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'ruined', 'painfully', 'boring', 'simply', 'stupid', 'fantasy', 'scenes', 'i', 'only', 'recommend', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'work', 'other', 'pass', 'it.MY', 'PERSONAL', 'RATING', '2', 'OUT', '5']",N/A
689274,ACVLLA37BN9KY,B00005Y6ZW,Valjean,"[3, 8]","Watching this movie is similar to reading a term paper with no thesis statement.  After the ending, you begin to understand what the writers were (maybe) trying to accomplish, but choppy editing throughout the movie only makes the viewer think that the several fantasy sequences revolving around Silverstone's character are only planted in the film to obscure the writers lack of imagination with regard to character development.In retrospect, the Babysitter (Silverstone) is supposed to be like Helen of Troy.  Men will risk thier families, jobs and freedom to sleep with her.  Among the people who want Alicia are her ex (?) boyfriend and a manipulative wanna-be-a-gangster suburban rich boy, who drunkenly conspire a plan to spy on her.  The manipulative rich kid dupes the ex into breaking and entering the house where Silverstone is babysitting then tries to rape her. Nuff said about the plot.Two things make the plot unbelievable.  First of all, Silverstone, taken as THE sole motive for a host of fantasies (some related and some utterly unrelated to the ending) and a rape attempt is not buyable.  In reality, Silvertone is no Helen of Troy, but yet another link of good-looking hollywood sausage.  More importantly, in the movie, her character is unexciting, bland and (ahem) clueless.Secondly, the antagonist rich hood's rape attempt is paradoxical.  He has sense enough to manipulate the Babysitter's boyfriend like an expert (a la Cruel Intentions), yet the during the last scene of the movie he smashes lamps on peoples heads and tries to rape Alicia in front of 2 small children.  Any criminologist could tell you that most psychotics are usually not silver-tounged manipulators and vice versa.On a final note, the writers could have used some of the time they spent on the fantasy sequences to develop the characters' backgrounds and motives.  At least then the film might not have been such a pile of garbage.",1,Helen of Troy...NOT!!!,1088380800,"06 28, 2004",2004,1926,"['Watching', 'movie', 'similar', 'reading', 'term', 'paper', 'thesis', 'statement', 'ending', 'begin', 'understand', 'what', 'writers', 'were', 'maybe', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'choppy', 'editing', 'movie', 'only', 'viewer', 'think', 'several', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'revolving', 'Silverstone', 'character', 'are', 'only', 'planted', 'film', 'obscure', 'writers', 'lack', 'imagination', 'regard', 'character', 'development.In', 'retrospect', 'Babysitter', 'Silverstone', 'supposed', 'be', 'Helen', 'Troy', 'Men', 'will', 'risk', 'thier', 'families', 'jobs', 'freedom', 'sleep', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'Alicia', 'are', 'ex', 'boyfriend', 'manipulative', 'wanna-be-a-gangster', 'suburban', 'rich', 'boy', 'who', 'drunkenly', 'conspire', 'plan', 'spy', 'manipulative', 'rich', 'kid', 'ex', 'breaking', 'entering', 'house', 'where', 'Silverstone', 'babysitting', 'then', 'rape', 'Nuff', 'said', 'plot.Two', 'things', 'make', 'plot', 'unbelievable', 'First', 'Silverstone', 'taken', 'THE', 'sole', 'motive', 'host', 'fantasies', 'related', 'utterly', 'unrelated', 'ending', 'rape', 'attempt', 'not', 'buyable', 'reality', 'Silvertone', 'Helen', 'Troy', 'yet', 'link', 'good-looking', 'hollywood', 'sausage', 'More', 'importantly', 'movie', 'character', 'unexciting', 'bland', 'ahem', 'clueless.Secondly', 'antagonist', 'rich', 'hood', 'rape', 'attempt', 'paradoxical', 'sense', 'enough', 'manipulate', 'Babysitter', 'boyfriend', 'expert', 'la', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'yet', 'last', 'scene', 'movie', 'lamps', 'peoples', 'heads', 'tries', 'rape', 'Alicia', 'front', '2', 'small', 'children', 'criminologist', 'could', 'tell', 'most', 'psychotics', 'are', 'usually', 'not', 'silver-tounged', 'manipulators', 'vice', 'versa.On', 'final', 'note', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'time', 'spent', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'develop', 'characters', 'backgrounds', 'motives', 'least', 'then', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'pile', 'garbage']",N/A
