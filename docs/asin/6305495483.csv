Directed with great sensitivity by James Moll, and with an affecting score by Hans Zimmer, it is a gripping testament to those who must not be forgotten.

466834,A62G4QX6XQVLP,6305495483,Anyechka,"[7, 10]","This moving documentary covers the lives of 5 Hungarian survivors who were young people during the war and who are all now United States citizens.  They are Alice Lok Cahana, Congressman Tom Lantos, Irene Zisblatt, Bill Basch, and Ren&eacute;e Firestone.  Although I had previously heard or read some of these people's stories, I hadn't heard all of them, nor all of the details provided here.  Also included are interviews with former Nazi doctor Hans M&uuml;nch, some American liberators, and Greek survivor Dario Gabbai (whom I'd also previously seen on at least one other documentary), who is, by his own estimates, one of only 4 Sonderkommandos who were alive at the time this film was shot (1998).The fate of Hungarian Jewry has always had a special fascination for me, since they were largely still intact until the spring of 1944, when the Nazis invaded their country (19 March), put them into ghettos, and between May and July sent the majority of them to their deaths.  A huge population that had been largely untouched was suddenly nearly obliterated in the blink of an eye, and in no other conquered nation-state in Europe was the Final Solution carried out with such frightening speed, savageness, barbarity, and support and assistance from the locals.  At least in Budapest, where Congressman Lantos and Mr. Basch (until he was accidentally deported to Buchenwald) were, it was relatively safer because it was a big city and not one of the small towns and cities where the people weren't as cosmopolitan and open-minded.  This documentary covers these 5 survivors before the war, during the war, and after the war, including their respective journeys, decades later, back to their hometowns and to the various camps where they were enslaved.Some people complain that there are ""too many"" books and films about the Shoah, and that after awhile it all starts to sound the same, or that the subject is too depressing for one to voluntarily immerse oneself in, but no two stories are exactly alike.  Each story is unique and worth telling and remembering, before it's too late to be recorded, and so that hopefully new generations will learn what hatred can lead to if left unchecked and unprotested, will realise that hatred isn't something one is born with, but rather something that one learns.  Each of these stories have their own unique touches, like Ren&eacute;e's beautiful bathing suit, Alice's artwork, the hanukiyah a liberated prisoner made from cement and nails and which decades later, a few years after his death, was finally delivered to Dr. Paul Parks, one of his liberators, and Irene's diamonds from her mother, which she managed to preserve all through the war and today wears in a tear-shaped pendant on a necklace, a necklace she intends to pass on through each firstborn female in her family line in perpetuity.  The most haunting story for me was when Alice talked about how she and her sister Edith began singing ""Shalom Aleychem"" in the outhouse at Auschwitz, a short time after their arrival, to welcome Shabbos in spite of their surroundings, and soon all of the people around them, whatever their nation of origin, joined in in the haunting Hebrew melody.  And all of the survivors report feeling pride and joy in having large families, rebuilding what the Nazis tried to take away from them, many coming from one or just a few survivors of what had been very large families.Extras include outtakes, photo galleries, the theatrical trailer, and filmographies of the producers, cinematographer, director and editor, photographer, music composer, and the executive producer.  The film is also available for viewing in both widescreen and fullscreen.  The only extra that seemed a bit out of place was executive producer Steven Spielberg's introduction to the Shoah Foundation, seeing as that very same introduction is already included at the beginning of the film itself!",5,An incredible journey,1162944000,"11 8, 2006",2006,3908,"['moving', 'documentary', 'covers', 'lives', '5', 'Hungarian', 'survivors', 'who', 'were', 'young', 'people', 'war', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'United', 'States', 'citizens', 'are', 'Alice', 'Lok', 'Cahana', 'Congressman', 'Tom', 'Lantos', 'Irene', 'Zisblatt', 'Bill', 'Basch', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Firestone', 'had', 'previously', 'heard', 'read', 'people', 'stories', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'details', 'provided', 'here', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'interviews', 'former', 'Nazi', 'doctor', 'Hans', 'M', 'uuml', 'American', 'liberators', 'Greek', 'survivor', 'Dario', 'Gabbai', 'whom', ""'d"", 'also', 'previously', 'seen', 'least', 'one', 'other', 'documentary', 'who', 'own', 'estimates', 'one', 'only', '4', 'Sonderkommandos', 'who', 'were', 'alive', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'shot', '1998', '.The', 'fate', 'Hungarian', 'Jewry', 'always', 'had', 'special', 'fascination', 'were', 'largely', 'still', 'intact', 'spring', '1944', 'when', 'Nazis', 'invaded', 'country', '19', 'March', 'put', 'ghettos', 'May', 'July', 'sent', 'majority', 'deaths', 'huge', 'population', 'had', 'been', 'largely', 'untouched', 'was', 'suddenly', 'nearly', 'obliterated', 'blink', 'eye', 'other', 'conquered', 'nation-state', 'Europe', 'was', 'Final', 'Solution', 'carried', 'out', 'such', 'frightening', 'speed', 'savageness', 'barbarity', 'support', 'assistance', 'locals', 'least', 'Budapest', 'where', 'Congressman', 'Lantos', 'Mr.', 'Basch', 'was', 'accidentally', 'deported', 'Buchenwald', 'were', 'was', 'relatively', 'safer', 'was', 'big', 'city', 'not', 'one', 'small', 'towns', 'cities', 'where', 'people', 'were', ""n't"", 'cosmopolitan', 'open-minded', 'documentary', '5', 'survivors', 'war', 'war', 'war', 'including', 'respective', 'journeys', 'decades', 'later', 'back', 'hometowns', 'various', 'camps', 'where', 'were', 'enslaved.Some', 'people', 'complain', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'books', 'films', 'Shoah', 'sound', 'same', 'subject', 'too', 'depressing', 'one', 'voluntarily', 'immerse', 'two', 'stories', 'are', 'exactly', 'alike', 'story', 'unique', 'worth', 'telling', 'remembering', 'too', 'late', 'be', 'recorded', 'so', 'hopefully', 'new', 'generations', 'will', 'learn', 'what', 'hatred', 'can', 'lead', 'left', 'unchecked', 'unprotested', 'will', 'realise', 'hatred', ""n't"", 'something', 'one', 'born', 'rather', 'something', 'one', 'stories', 'have', 'own', 'unique', 'touches', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'beautiful', 'bathing', 'suit', 'Alice', 'artwork', 'hanukiyah', 'liberated', 'prisoner', 'made', 'cement', 'nails', 'decades', 'later', 'few', 'years', 'death', 'was', 'finally', 'delivered', 'Dr.', 'Paul', 'Parks', 'one', 'liberators', 'Irene', 'diamonds', 'mother', 'managed', 'preserve', 'war', 'today', 'wears', 'tear-shaped', 'pendant', 'necklace', 'necklace', 'pass', 'firstborn', 'female', 'family', 'line', 'perpetuity', 'most', 'haunting', 'story', 'was', 'when', 'Alice', 'talked', 'how', 'sister', 'Edith', 'began', 'singing', 'Shalom', 'Aleychem', 'outhouse', 'Auschwitz', 'short', 'time', 'arrival', 'welcome', 'Shabbos', 'spite', 'surroundings', 'soon', 'people', 'nation', 'origin', 'joined', 'haunting', 'Hebrew', 'melody', 'survivors', 'report', 'feeling', 'pride', 'joy', 'having', 'large', 'families', 'rebuilding', 'what', 'Nazis', 'tried', 'take', 'away', 'many', 'coming', 'one', 'just', 'few', 'survivors', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'very', 'large', 'families.Extras', 'include', 'outtakes', 'photo', 'galleries', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'filmographies', 'producers', 'cinematographer', 'director', 'editor', 'photographer', 'music', 'composer', 'executive', 'producer', 'film', 'also', 'available', 'viewing', 'widescreen', 'fullscreen', 'only', 'extra', 'seemed', 'bit', 'place', 'was', 'executive', 'producer', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'introduction', 'Shoah', 'Foundation', 'seeing', 'very', 'same', 'introduction', 'already', 'included', 'beginning', 'film']",The Last Days VHS

I can think of few other texts which as scrupulously chronicle the dilemmas of innocent suffering as this tale of the odysseys of five survivors of the Holocaust in Hungry in the brutal twilight years of the Final Solution.  The essential point here is that the suffering engendered by genocide occurs first and foremost within an entirely personal context.  The film brings this reality home with impact.There is a scene where one of the survivors of Auschwitz sits down with one of the Nazi doctors (who received clemency at Nuremburg) and inquires into the death of her sister who was 'experimented' on in his clinic at the death camp.  This scene may be the most extrodinary in all of film.  Revealed is the brute insensitivity which thus infests our relations - the evasion of the moral responsibility which we do bear toward each other universally, by destiny of birth - of which none is innocent. None of us.Were Hitler's willing executioners less guilty than those of us who acquiesed to the decade of heartless sanctions in Iraq resulting in the death of half a million (I believe an American official notoriously referred to this consequence as ""collateral damage"")?  Having experienced the film in virtually every season these many years, I am impelled to ask if the heros of the Shoah did not die in vain.We cannot expect peace in our lives as individuals until we address the question of how we are going to establish just relations in society?  Like the scene in the film where the above mentioned survivor returns to her ancestral home from which she was snatched by the Nazis and cannot open the door, we cannot turn back the clock, and crawl back into the womb of ideas and ideologies - as Thomas Wolfe put it well - there comes a moment when one can never go home again.The world is one as, in some sense, at the least, are its residents. This recognition is the common understanding of our age - the post modern. The Holocaust is perhaps the most dramatic lesson  of the past century, in the calculated and protracted nature of its horror.  As another of the survivors in the film comments: "". . . what landscapes . . . you are looking at . . . this is a madman's hell"".  The message of those who experienced the Holocaust is that this landscape must be transformed. This task is the particularly defining human task - and the nuclear threat which was fueled by the response to that suffering - makes the completion of that task all the more urgent.  The film clearly tells us that the work is personal and success is possible.What I like most about the film and find uplifting is the redemption which is experienced by these few survivors - and how that redemption is possible for us all - if and when we finally get and are willing to give it.",5,a memorial to my people,1147392000,"05 12, 2006",2006,2895,"['have', 'been', 'showing', 'Last', 'Days', 'faithfully', 'semester', 'Critical', 'Thinking', 'classes', 'release', 'video', '1998', 'can', 'think', 'few', 'other', 'texts', 'scrupulously', 'dilemmas', 'innocent', 'suffering', 'tale', 'odysseys', 'five', 'survivors', 'Holocaust', 'Hungry', 'brutal', 'twilight', 'years', 'Final', 'Solution', 'essential', 'point', 'here', 'suffering', 'engendered', 'genocide', 'occurs', 'first', 'foremost', 'entirely', 'personal', 'context', 'film', 'reality', 'home', 'impact.There', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'survivors', 'Auschwitz', 'down', 'one', 'Nazi', 'doctors', 'who', 'received', 'clemency', 'Nuremburg', 'death', 'sister', 'who', 'was', ""'experimented"", 'clinic', 'death', 'camp', 'scene', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'extrodinary', 'film', 'Revealed', 'brute', 'insensitivity', 'thus', 'relations', 'evasion', 'moral', 'responsibility', 'do', 'bear', 'other', 'universally', 'destiny', 'birth', 'none', 'innocent', 'None', 'us.Were', 'Hitler', 'willing', 'executioners', 'less', 'guilty', 'who', 'acquiesed', 'decade', 'heartless', 'sanctions', 'Iraq', 'resulting', 'death', 'million', 'believe', 'American', 'official', 'notoriously', 'referred', 'consequence', 'collateral', 'damage', 'Having', 'experienced', 'film', 'virtually', 'season', 'many', 'years', 'am', 'impelled', 'ask', 'heros', 'Shoah', 'did', 'not', 'die', 'vain.We', 'can', 'not', 'expect', 'peace', 'lives', 'individuals', 'address', 'question', 'how', 'are', 'going', 'establish', 'just', 'relations', 'society', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'above', 'mentioned', 'survivor', 'returns', 'ancestral', 'home', 'was', 'snatched', 'Nazis', 'can', 'not', 'open', 'door', 'can', 'not', 'turn', 'back', 'clock', 'crawl', 'back', 'womb', 'ideas', 'ideologies', 'Thomas', 'Wolfe', 'put', 'well', 'moment', 'when', 'one', 'can', 'never', 'go', 'home', 'again.The', 'world', 'one', 'sense', 'least', 'are', 'residents', 'recognition', 'common', 'understanding', 'age', 'post', 'modern', 'Holocaust', 'perhaps', 'most', 'dramatic', 'lesson', 'past', 'century', 'calculated', 'protracted', 'nature', 'horror', 'survivors', 'film', 'comments', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'madman', 'hell', 'message', 'who', 'experienced', 'Holocaust', 'landscape', 'must', 'be', 'transformed', 'task', 'particularly', 'defining', 'human', 'task', 'nuclear', 'threat', 'was', 'fueled', 'response', 'suffering', 'completion', 'task', 'more', 'urgent', 'film', 'clearly', 'work', 'personal', 'success', 'possible.What', 'like', 'most', 'film', 'find', 'uplifting', 'redemption', 'experienced', 'few', 'survivors', 'how', 'redemption', 'possible', 'when', 'finally', 'get', 'are', 'willing', 'give']",The Last Days VHS

They took it for granted that their Christian neighbors were true friends and wished them no harm.  This illusion was brutally shattered after the Nazi invasion.  These Christians often took special delight in harassing Jews and handing them over to Hitler's thugs.  What happened to God?  Why did He allow such evil to exist?  You will find the interviews with these survivors of the Holocaust riveting.The Hungarian aspect of the Holocaust is most interesting, if for no other reason, but to show how committed the Nazis were to slaughtering Jews and others deemed racially inferior---even if it jeopardized their war efforts.  Indeed, it appears that Jew killing was deemed of paramount importance.  Nothing else was allowed to stand in the way.

While in Auschwitz, she claims to have repeatedly defecated and swallowed a diamond.  If you can swallow that, then maybe you'll believe that she's telling the truth when she claims to have been selected to be made into a lampshade (no serious historian defends the human skin lampshade propaganda story today), had her tattoo removed by doctor Mengele (how convenient), and escaped from inside a gas chamber.  If those claims failed to trip your BS detector, maybe you'll choke on her claim that an inmate saved her by throwing her over the barbed wire fence around the crematorium (and alleged gas chamber) into a waiting train car.  He must have been quite an athlete, because that would have been a throw of around a hundred feet. For comparison, the world record for throwing the shot put - 16 pounds - is today around 75 feet (set during the height of the steroid era), and the record at the time of WWII was 57 feet.Paul Parks, a black man who claims to have liberated Dachau, is also prominently featured.  After ""The Last Days"" was released, The Boston Globe ran a series of stories showing that his unit was nowhere near Dachau when it was liberated, and that he had repeatedly lied in his other wartime stories.These and many more lies in ""The Last Days"" are exposed in the documentary ""The Last Days of the Big Lie,"" which is available on youtube.

And so a *moving* picture, clipping along at the rate of 24 frames per second, has the potential to be priceless.  THE LAST DAYS proves that, and does so powerfully and with  uncommon eloquence.  Focusing on the Nazi campaign against Hungarian Jews  during the last few months of World War II, the film interweaves recent  interviews with survivors of this atrocity with vintage documentary film  footage and photographs.  The result is a very potent and poignant lesson  that speaks of our common humanity (and potential for inhumanity), the mob  mentality, individuality, and how those human dynamics come into play  during the course of history.  I found at the end of the film that my shirt  collar was damp from tears that I had not realized I was shedding, and that  the storytellers leave a lasting impression --- a week later, their words  and faces are still sharply etched in my mind, and I suspect I will always  remember them.The film-to-DVD transfer is flawless, and there are  powerful extra features to explore: a still archive, deleted sequences, the  theatrical trailer, and much, much more.

I have seen ""Schindler's List"", it is a powerful, haunting film.  While it is based on a real event of the Shoah, it is still a fictional film.  There are actors playing parts and despite the brutality we see in the movie, everyone goes home at the end of the day.  What makes ""The Last Days"" so much more powerful is that the five primary interviewees are survivors of the Holocaust.  They are telling their stories of their lives and their experiences of Hitler's Final Solution.  There is actual video footage, and photographs from the time, and it is still shocking to hear and to see, and I would suggest that it remains necessary to hear and to see.This is the story of five Jews from Hungary.  They tell of their experiences before, during, and after the war.  They were all in various camps: Auschwitz, Dachau, Buchenwald, Bergen-Belsen.  Their stories are incredible, and since the stories are being told by the men and women who experienced the Holocaust, they are all the more powerful.  We learn how they were rounded up and put into the train cars, what they thought, why they didn't actively resist, and what happened to the rest of their families.  We also get to see them each go back for the first time to the concentration camps they were held in.  They are with their children, and are revealing little details, mostly painful, as they remember them.  One man, as he walks through the gates says that even after all these years, the memories are just as fresh as when he was a prisoner.I don't feel that my description does this film justice.

How can a society, how can a single person, inflict such cruelty upon another person? Well, instead of addressing that familiar question it presents three distinct perspectives on the holocaust.First, the survivors tell of their life before it: life in a regular town, living a regular life. They tell of how that changed, usually by insidious degrees as opposed to all at one moment. It is horrifying to see how it happened, how it started. The Nazi's suppression was so subtle at first, gradually becoming more harsh, and yet seemingly not that far out of the ordinary, at least not as much so as what was to follow. You can see how it could happen to anybody. People didn't think to run. This is the first perspective.The second perspective is of the survivors talking about their experiences in interviews, the horrors they saw, the last time they saw they their father, the way people were executed by a perfectly efficient system. They tell how they swallowed jewels to keep them safe. The survivors recount their stories from memory.The third perspective is the most unusual: the survivors actually visiting the ruins of the camp they had witnessed such horror in, lived in for a period of months. They walk over to a decrepit foundation of a building and say ""This was the latrine,"" and then tell how they performed a ceremony in there. You get to see the places where the attrocities happened, which of course you've seen before probably, but this time you have a guide who was actually there. This is not a history lesson, but a personal narrative.There is actually a fourth perspective too: a Nazi doctor from Auschwitz, who is interviewed both by one of the documentarians and also by one of the survivors. You get to hear her perspective on his tale.An extremely well rounded story, which will help you understand on an emotional level what was going on.",5,Told in Four Unique Perspectives,1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,1963,"['course', 'know', 'horrifying', 'stories', 'holocaust', 'shoah', 'Jews', 'call', 'How', 'can', 'society', 'how', 'can', 'single', 'person', 'inflict', 'such', 'cruelty', 'person', 'Well', 'instead', 'addressing', 'familiar', 'question', 'three', 'distinct', 'perspectives', 'holocaust.First', 'survivors', 'tell', 'life', 'life', 'regular', 'town', 'living', 'regular', 'life', 'tell', 'how', 'changed', 'usually', 'insidious', 'degrees', 'opposed', 'one', 'moment', 'horrifying', 'see', 'how', 'happened', 'how', 'started', 'Nazi', 'suppression', 'was', 'so', 'subtle', 'first', 'gradually', 'becoming', 'more', 'harsh', 'yet', 'seemingly', 'not', 'far', 'ordinary', 'least', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'follow', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'happen', 'anybody', 'People', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'run', 'first', 'perspective.The', 'second', 'perspective', 'survivors', 'talking', 'experiences', 'interviews', 'horrors', 'saw', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'father', 'way', 'people', 'were', 'executed', 'perfectly', 'efficient', 'system', 'tell', 'how', 'swallowed', 'jewels', 'keep', 'safe', 'survivors', 'recount', 'stories', 'memory.The', 'third', 'perspective', 'most', 'unusual', 'survivors', 'actually', 'visiting', 'ruins', 'camp', 'had', 'witnessed', 'such', 'horror', 'lived', 'period', 'months', 'walk', 'decrepit', 'foundation', 'building', 'say', 'was', 'latrine', 'then', 'tell', 'how', 'performed', 'ceremony', 'there', 'get', 'see', 'places', 'where', 'attrocities', 'happened', 'course', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'probably', 'time', 'have', 'guide', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'there', 'not', 'history', 'lesson', 'personal', 'narrative.There', 'actually', 'fourth', 'perspective', 'too', 'Nazi', 'doctor', 'Auschwitz', 'who', 'interviewed', 'one', 'documentarians', 'also', 'one', 'survivors', 'get', 'hear', 'perspective', 'tale.An', 'extremely', 'well', 'rounded', 'story', 'will', 'help', 'understand', 'emotional', 'level', 'what', 'was', 'going']",The Last Days VHS

466845,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6305495483,Linda Linguvic,"[37, 41]","This documentary of five Hungarian survivors of the holocaust is not a comfortable movie to watch. We cannot make believe that it is an re-enactment by actors; we are not distanced from it by the general news clips. Instead, this tightly edited film brings five individual stories of real people to the screen with a scorching reality. In the last six months of WWII, Hitler concentrated his resources in deporting 440,000 Hungarian Jews even after he knew the war was lost. The five people in the documentary, then teenagers, were caught up in this brutal chapter of history, and each one tells his or her story against a backdrop of rare footage of films that were taken by the Nazis. Now in their late 60s and 70s, each one of these survivors, surrounded by loving families, visit the scene of the devastation, and tell their stories.Steven Spielberg is the executive producer of this small gem of a film, a memorial to the horrible truth, and I am sure it is his name which brings this film to movie theaters, where I first saw this film. The theater complex on had only two showings -- at noon and at 4:55 p.m. I cannot help but wonder why it was deemed unfit for Saturday night viewing, because every seat was taken in the tiny theater. I cried, and heard the sobbing of the people around me. It was that kind of film. The human beings on the screen were so real. Their stories so true. Their lives so shattered. And then rebuilt. A living testimony to the survival of the human spirit. It's a testimony also of what can be done with film. How a history can be preserved. How snapshots of real life can be recorded. As I left the theater, my eyes swollen from crying, my soul sick from what I have just seen, there were lines of people waiting to get into see the latest romantic comedy, the newest thriller, the silliest cartoons. My heart was still beating wildly as I gulped the fresh air outside the theater and walked slowly home, the horror and the history still touching my raw nerves. I cannot help but think about the other sad stories in history that cry out to be memorialized in this way. And the fact that without a big name like Spielberg, or the proper funding, these stories will never be told. But why do we need to know? What good does it do? How can it change our lives to relive over and over again the many atrocities of humankind? The answer lives in the perspective it gives us as we go about our lives. We are only a part of the continuum of history. It is luck or karma or just the random winds of life that give us our lives of abundance. And when I pause, and think about it seriously, I can only give thanks for my wonderful life.",5,Real People and the Real Horror of the Holocaust,1012608000,"02 2, 2002",2002,2664,"['documentary', 'five', 'Hungarian', 'survivors', 'holocaust', 'not', 'comfortable', 'movie', 'watch', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'believe', 're-enactment', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'distanced', 'general', 'news', 'clips', 'Instead', 'tightly', 'edited', 'film', 'five', 'individual', 'stories', 'real', 'people', 'screen', 'scorching', 'reality', 'last', 'six', 'months', 'WWII', 'Hitler', 'concentrated', 'resources', 'deporting', '440,000', 'Hungarian', 'Jews', 'even', 'knew', 'war', 'was', 'lost', 'five', 'people', 'documentary', 'then', 'teenagers', 'were', 'caught', 'up', 'brutal', 'chapter', 'history', 'one', 'story', 'backdrop', 'rare', 'footage', 'films', 'were', 'taken', 'Nazis', 'Now', 'late', '60s', '70s', 'one', 'survivors', 'surrounded', 'loving', 'families', 'visit', 'scene', 'devastation', 'tell', 'stories.Steven', 'Spielberg', 'executive', 'producer', 'small', 'gem', 'film', 'memorial', 'horrible', 'truth', 'am', 'sure', 'name', 'film', 'movie', 'theaters', 'where', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'theater', 'complex', 'had', 'only', 'two', 'showings', 'noon', '4:55', 'p.m', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'deemed', 'unfit', 'Saturday', 'night', 'viewing', 'seat', 'was', 'taken', 'tiny', 'theater', 'cried', 'heard', 'sobbing', 'people', 'was', 'kind', 'film', 'human', 'beings', 'screen', 'were', 'so', 'real', 'stories', 'so', 'true', 'lives', 'so', 'shattered', 'then', 'rebuilt', 'living', 'testimony', 'survival', 'human', 'spirit', 'testimony', 'also', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'film', 'How', 'history', 'can', 'be', 'preserved', 'How', 'snapshots', 'real', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'recorded', 'left', 'theater', 'eyes', 'swollen', 'crying', 'soul', 'sick', 'what', 'have', 'just', 'seen', 'were', 'lines', 'people', 'waiting', 'get', 'see', 'latest', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'newest', 'thriller', 'silliest', 'cartoons', 'heart', 'was', 'still', 'beating', 'wildly', 'gulped', 'fresh', 'air', 'theater', 'walked', 'slowly', 'home', 'horror', 'history', 'still', 'touching', 'raw', 'nerves', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'other', 'sad', 'stories', 'history', 'out', 'be', 'memorialized', 'way', 'fact', 'big', 'name', 'Spielberg', 'proper', 'funding', 'stories', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'told', 'why', 'do', 'need', 'know', 'What', 'good', 'do', 'How', 'can', 'change', 'lives', 'relive', 'over', 'again', 'many', 'atrocities', 'humankind', 'answer', 'perspective', 'go', 'lives', 'are', 'only', 'part', 'continuum', 'history', 'luck', 'karma', 'just', 'random', 'winds', 'life', 'give', 'lives', 'abundance', 'when', 'pause', 'think', 'seriously', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'thanks', 'wonderful', 'life']",The Last Days VHS

Sherwin,"[3, 6]","--quote by Elie Wiesel""The Last Days"" is a difficult, painful film to watch--but it must be watched so that the world and future generations will know just how relentless Hitler and the Nazis were to kill all the Jews in Europe--and especially in this film the Jews of Hungary in the final year of World War Two. The story is told very well; there's a lot of interview time with five Hungarian Holocaust survivors, brief interviews with American soldiers who liberated the death camps (who were shocked to see the atrocities being committed there) and archival footage that made me feel I was there! There is even an interview with a Nazi doctor at one of the camps who ""experimented"" on Jews; he becomes rather evasive when he meets one of the Holocaust survivors and I never really got the sense that he was truly remorseful for his actions even though he states he was acquitted because he did some ""harmless"" experiments on Jews to, as he says, ""help them survive."" Nevertheless, the stories are profoundly sad, tragic and insane--this film is bound to have a significant impact on you and I don't recommend it for the faint of heart. How especially tragic it was that these poor Hungarian Jewish people were murdered so close to the end of the war! Many Hungarian Jews almost survived World War Two and given the conditions in Hitler's death camps it's amazing that anyone, Jew or non-Jew, lived.Some of the most poignant footage is of the Holocaust survivors (Tom Lantos, Alice Lok Cahana, Bill Basch, Renee Firestone and Irene Zisblatt) returning to their home towns and the remains of the death camps where they were imprisoned; emotions run high as you might expect and it's very powerful.The DVD comes with bonus extras. I appreciated the outtakes including ""behind the scenes"" and the photo gallery is very well done. There is a brief bio of the filmmakers and the theatrical trailer.Overall, ""The Last Days"" is essential viewing for anyone studying the Holocaust; World War Two; the history of Jewry and anti-Semitism and even world history.
