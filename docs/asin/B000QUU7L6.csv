1078049,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B000QUU7L6,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[0, 0]","Why can'tdance moviesbe JUSTabout dancing?  No b.s trash-talking from opposing homies using the colloquial school of Dr. Seuss, no egregious parents telling the leading character what not to do in his/her life before they predictably accept the youth's way of life in the final act, no random drama just to reaffirm the crew's art of the urban foot-fancy, just 90 minutes of people doing the worm, krumping, head-spinning, robot, foot flips, moping the floor, and other miscellaneous impossible acts of breakin'.  There's a reason why critics don't care for these movies and I doubt casuals are watching them for the character development; no surprise many of them couldn't even succeed ""Save The Last Dance"", let alone ""Footloose"".  When it comes to ""Kickin' It Old Skool"", it did step up its game by making it a comedy, but then ""Dance Flick"" was also a comedy and it tanked.  So did this, but it's also an homage to the 1980s as well as its early age of b-boying.  The novelty was admirable, but Jamie Kennedy couldn't dance his way to the idea with cleverness and dignity.Let's get to the smooth moves.  The breakdancing portion wasn't much to snuff, but it has its share of praises.  I like the mime crew during the climatic tournament, they had some pretty creative choreography; they're a gimmick, granted, but they serve to please.  During the tournament, I was actually rooting for the rival troupe Ice Cole Krew, which they managed to impress me with their ridiculous b-boyin'; they impressed me so much that I thought the main crew were chumps that somehow advance to the finals, even though they broke a couple of rules during the tournament.  Most of the decent stuff happens in the last quarter of the film, so what's the rest of the film have?  Jamie Kennedy making blatant commentaries about how this isn't the 80s anymore, and tiring jokes like 'the internet is for porn'; jeez, haven't heard that since ""Avenue Q"".But why all the 80s comments?  Well, the movie started back then during an elementary school dance-off, which is weird since the contestants look like they're teenagers (but I guess that's an 80s reference in itself).  A kid named Rocket Shoe is the leader of a dance crew called the Funky Fresh Boys, and is steadying with his girl Jen while competing against his foe.  Shoe tried to do special move during the match, but that lead to his coma.  20 years later, he woke up in a world he doesn't understand, and is being cared for by his incompetent parents; well, they're not TOO incompetent, since they manage to pay the hospital bills for 20 years.  Believing he owes them, the 30-year-old-with-a-13-year-old mind decided to bring back the old Funky Fresh Krew to win a contest for cash, while meeting up his old girl who's engaged to the foe who grew up to beLex Luthor.Judging by the prologue, in the 1980s, every character makes a pop-culture reference at every line they speak. I know this is an homage, but the movie is basically yelling at the audience, ""HEY LOOK, THIS IS THE EIGHTIES!  THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE DO IN THE EIGHTIES!  I HOPE YOU'RE REMINDED THIS IS THE EIGHTIES!  DON'T LEAVE NOW, WE HAVE A 'ST. ELSEWHERE' REFERENCE COMING UP!""  Ergh, gag me with a spork!  Outside of a few subtle touches like Alan Ruck making a 'Ferris' allusion and the flux capacitor in the hospital, the references are unsubtle to the point of arrogance, and it goes on even when adult Rocket Shoe (Kennedy) was on a wacky misguided journey using decades-old logic on present-day standards.  He's not funny, and in fact he and his old crew are embarrassing.  One member is the guy from ""Juwanna Mann"", and his shtick is remaking existing products and urbanize them (kinda like""Death at a Funeral""); the other is a Asian character trying to avoid being the stereotype, which is ironic given the actor who's resum&eacute; is playing Asian stereotypes on ""Mad TV""; the last member is a chubby Hispanic...he manage to out-pathetic Horatio Sanz from ""Boat Trip"".  Even though they're suppose to be the sad sack of a crew, their worn-out jokes and C-grade deliveries made they even more melancholy.The problem with ""Kickin' It Old Skool"" is that it has the ingredients for success, but doesn't know how to mix it properly.  The movie has a homeless breakdancer, which sounds potentially awesome, but all he does is doing the worm and urinates himself; what a disappointing result for such a comedy idea.  And then there's the scene with David Hasselhoff and his working K.I.T.T.; thank you for adding the surreal to a somewhat-grounded story.  Pathetic characters and pathetic attempts at bring in the laughs leads to a pathetic movie.  But there's one awesome thing this movie has: the Garfield phone.  Never have I seen it before, and I love how its eyes move whenever the phone's used.  I would love to buy that Garfield phone.",2,"Pop and lock, but doesn't rock",1278460800,"07 7, 2010",2010,4848,"['Why', ""can'tdance"", 'moviesbe', 'dancing', 'b.s', 'trash-talking', 'opposing', 'homies', 'using', 'colloquial', 'school', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'egregious', 'parents', 'telling', 'leading', 'character', 'what', 'not', 'do', 'life', 'predictably', 'accept', 'youth', 'way', 'life', 'final', 'act', 'random', 'drama', 'just', 'reaffirm', 'crew', 'art', 'urban', 'foot-fancy', 'just', '90', 'minutes', 'people', 'doing', 'worm', 'krumping', 'head-spinning', 'robot', 'foot', 'flips', 'moping', 'floor', 'other', 'miscellaneous', 'impossible', 'acts', 'breakin', 'reason', 'why', 'critics', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'movies', 'doubt', 'casuals', 'are', 'watching', 'character', 'development', 'surprise', 'many', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'succeed', 'Save', 'Last', 'Dance', 'let', 'alone', 'Footloose', 'When', 'Kickin', 'Old', 'Skool', 'did', 'step', 'up', 'game', 'making', 'comedy', 'then', 'Dance', 'Flick', 'was', 'also', 'comedy', 'tanked', 'So', 'did', 'also', 'homage', '1980s', 'as', 'well', 'early', 'age', 'b-boying', 'novelty', 'was', 'admirable', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'could', ""n't"", 'dance', 'way', 'idea', 'cleverness', 'dignity.Let', 'get', 'smooth', 'moves', 'breakdancing', 'portion', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'snuff', 'share', 'praises', 'mime', 'crew', 'climatic', 'tournament', 'had', 'pretty', 'creative', 'choreography', ""'re"", 'gimmick', 'granted', 'serve', 'please', 'tournament', 'was', 'actually', 'rooting', 'rival', 'troupe', 'Ice', 'Cole', 'Krew', 'managed', 'impress', 'ridiculous', 'b-boyin', 'impressed', 'so', 'much', 'thought', 'main', 'crew', 'were', 'chumps', 'somehow', 'advance', 'finals', 'even', 'broke', 'couple', 'rules', 'tournament', 'Most', 'decent', 'stuff', 'last', 'quarter', 'film', 'what', 'rest', 'film', 'have', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'making', 'blatant', 'commentaries', 'how', ""n't"", '80s', 'anymore', 'tiring', 'jokes', ""'the"", 'internet', 'porn', 'jeez', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'Avenue', 'Q', '.But', 'why', '80s', 'comments', 'Well', 'movie', 'started', 'back', 'then', 'elementary', 'school', 'dance-off', 'weird', 'contestants', 'look', ""'re"", 'teenagers', 'guess', '80s', 'reference', 'kid', 'named', 'Rocket', 'Shoe', 'leader', 'dance', 'crew', 'called', 'Funky', 'Fresh', 'Boys', 'steadying', 'girl', 'Jen', 'competing', 'foe', 'Shoe', 'tried', 'do', 'special', 'move', 'match', 'lead', 'coma', '20', 'years', 'later', 'woke', 'up', 'world', ""n't"", 'understand', 'being', 'cared', 'incompetent', 'parents', 'well', ""'re"", 'not', 'TOO', 'incompetent', 'manage', 'pay', 'hospital', 'bills', '20', 'years', 'Believing', '30-year-old-with-a-13-year-old', 'mind', 'decided', 'bring', 'back', 'old', 'Funky', 'Fresh', 'Krew', 'win', 'contest', 'cash', 'meeting', 'up', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'engaged', 'foe', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'beLex', 'Luthor.Judging', 'prologue', '1980s', 'character', 'pop-culture', 'reference', 'line', 'speak', 'know', 'homage', 'movie', 'basically', 'yelling', 'audience', 'HEY', 'LOOK', 'THIS', 'THE', 'EIGHTIES', 'THIS', 'WHAT', 'PEOPLE', 'DO', 'IN', 'THE', 'EIGHTIES', 'HOPE', 'REMINDED', 'THIS', 'THE', 'EIGHTIES', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'LEAVE', 'NOW', 'WE', 'HAVE', ""'ST"", 'ELSEWHERE', 'REFERENCE', 'COMING', 'UP', 'Ergh', 'gag', 'spork', 'few', 'subtle', 'touches', 'Alan', 'Ruck', 'making', ""'Ferris"", 'allusion', 'flux', 'capacitor', 'hospital', 'references', 'are', 'unsubtle', 'point', 'arrogance', 'even', 'when', 'adult', 'Rocket', 'Shoe', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'wacky', 'misguided', 'journey', 'using', 'decades-old', 'logic', 'present-day', 'standards', 'not', 'funny', 'fact', 'old', 'crew', 'are', 'embarrassing', 'One', 'member', 'guy', 'Juwanna', 'Mann', 'shtick', 'remaking', 'existing', 'products', 'urbanize', 'kinda', 'Death', 'Funeral', 'other', 'Asian', 'character', 'trying', 'avoid', 'being', 'stereotype', 'ironic', 'given', 'actor', 'who', 'resum', 'eacute', 'playing', 'Asian', 'stereotypes', 'Mad', 'TV', 'last', 'member', 'chubby', 'Hispanic', 'manage', 'out-pathetic', 'Horatio', 'Sanz', 'Boat', 'Trip', 'Even', ""'re"", 'suppose', 'be', 'sad', 'sack', 'crew', 'worn-out', 'jokes', 'C-grade', 'deliveries', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'melancholy.The', 'problem', 'Kickin', 'Old', 'Skool', 'ingredients', 'success', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'mix', 'properly', 'movie', 'homeless', 'breakdancer', 'potentially', 'awesome', 'doing', 'worm', 'what', 'disappointing', 'result', 'comedy', 'idea', 'then', 'scene', 'David', 'Hasselhoff', 'working', 'K.I.T.T', 'thank', 'adding', 'surreal', 'somewhat-grounded', 'story', 'Pathetic', 'characters', 'pathetic', 'attempts', 'bring', 'laughs', 'pathetic', 'movie', 'one', 'awesome', 'thing', 'movie', 'Garfield', 'phone', 'have', 'seen', 'love', 'how', 'eyes', 'move', 'whenever', 'phone', 'used', 'would', 'love', 'buy', 'Garfield', 'phone']",Kickin' It Old Skool

The comedy follows similar premises to movies like Big, 13 Going On 30 and Blast From The Past but with less thought put into it.

This cliched scenario is presented in the most unrealistic way I've ever seen it, but it still fails to deliver any laughs. I tried to persevere with the movie but by the time the final dance contest started it had become torturously mind-numbing.

1078057,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000QUU7L6,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","The way I figure it, it takes about a good twenty years for a decent nostalgia trend to kick in. That's just about the point at which the youngsters of a particular era will have experienced enough of adult life to start them pining away for the ""good old days"" of their pleasantly carefree and invariably misspent youth.  In the 1970's, audiences escaped back to the more innocent and halcyon days of the 1950's through works such as ""American Graffiti"" and ""Happy Days,"" while in the `80's, it was the '60's that got replayed, via ""The Wonder Years"" and ""The Right Stuff.""  In a similar way, ""That `70's Show"" came to define nostalgia for the young adults of the `90`s.  Now, apparently, it is the `80's that are making a comeback, as those who were kids in that decade begin to edge their way ever so reluctantly into middle age.  That's where the comedy, ""Kickin' it Old Skool,"" comes in.The premise of the movie is as follows: in 1986, a ten-year-old named Justin Schumacher suffered a concussion at one of his break dance competitions that left him in a coma for twenty years.  When he finally returns to consciousness two decades later, he discovers, much to his dismay, that the world has moved on without him, and that everything that was once important and familiar to him - from the fashions to the technology to the music - is now hopelessly ""un-cool"" and out-of-date.  After he learns that his parents will soon be going bankrupt if they can't find a way to pay for all the medical expenses they incurred while caring for their comatose son, Justin convinces his old break dancing buddies to come out of retirement and enter a contest, the winners of which will receive a whopping $100,000 in prize money.There really is very little point to ""Kickin' it Old Skool"" beyond providing an opportunity for us to laugh at all those pop culture trends and icons that we thought were so cool at the time but that seem merely quaint and funny to us today.  Thus, we get the big hair, the head bands, the glitter, the parachute-pants, the synthesizer-laden music, the boom boxes, the Michael Jackson moves, the ""What yu' talkin' `bout, Willis?"" quips that, for some at least, have come to define the era.  Unfortunately, that is hardly a sufficient foundation upon which to build a quality movie, and ""Kickin' it Old Skool"" ultimately emerges as a wan, not-very-funny cross between ""Footloose"" and all those inexplicably popular flicks in which a youngster mysteriously wakes up in an adult person's body.  Although it's genial and harmless, ""Kickin' it Old Skool"" suffers even more in comparison to a movie like ""Superbad,"" which is a truly whip-smart and astutely observant study of what it means to be a dork or a misfit in a society that values appearance and coolness above all else.  Moreover, Jamie Kennedy is clearly no Jonah Hill or Michael Cera in the acting department.  In fact, with his pratfalls, clowning and mugging, he often seems to be channeling a bad imitation of Jerry Lewis.Even though David Hasselhoff and Emmanuel Lewis stop by for a couple of good-natured cameos, this is one fish-out-of-water tale that should probably be thrown back in the water.At best, the movie makes one wonder how audiences twenty years from now will be looking back at the 00's.

This is meant to be a parody and in that respect accomplishes one thing: this movie isn't taking itself too seriously.  Jamie Kennedy is a dancer who tries to woo a hot chick and prove that his dance crew still brings the funk.  To be honest when I had this DVD I was already doubting it, I thought it was going to be bland and tasteless.  Instead I found myself chuckling and enjoying myself.  The whole plot has been done before.  The poor schmuck that is fighting all odds and rescuing a old crush from her ""evil"" boyfriend who are engaged.  The surprising thing about this is that it is truly hilarious with some awkward moments that are extremely disgusting and just plain disturbing.  The only thing that I have to nick pick is the character ""Kip"" and the rival crew they are annoying and stupid, they serve a good purpose but are extremely overdone.  The cast is amazing and really make this movie shine but if you want to watch a good comedy that is smart and enlightening...you're out of luck.  Even though I think this movie is great it isn't for everyone.  If you are nick picky and a little smug this movie is a severe waste of time.  However, if you just want to have a good time and laugh and except this movie for what it is: a parody, then prepare to have a hell of a time.
