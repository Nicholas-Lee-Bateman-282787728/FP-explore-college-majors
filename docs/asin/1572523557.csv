187258,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,1572523557,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 1]","I support local filmmaking.  I support the independent artist that wants to express himself/herself in the cinematic way.  What I enjoy with the independent artist is their way of expressing the already known.  For example, one of my favorite films is the independent sci-fi time travel piece called ""Primer"", you may or may not have heard of it.  The reason that I enjoy it so much is because it takes an old idea (that of time travel) and redefines it.  It recreates the wheel that Hollywood seems to cannot seem to do without CGI and actors with too much money.  It was exciting then to get Larry Fessenden's original student film ""Habit"" except with a bigger budget and after being immersed in the game a bit longer.  Fessenden's newer version of ""Habit"" gives us more gore, more scenery, and more ... well ... nudity than originally envisioned.  He takes the typical ""vampire"" wheel (a story that we have seen in countless films) and recreates - giving us a modern day horror that is built upon both mythological lore as well as personal demons.  During the course of 112 minutes, a great story is unfolded before our eyes - alas, it isn't the most powerful of stories, nor is it the most well-acted of stories, but it has something most Hollywood big-budget films seem to lack today , that is heart and substance.Fessenden, who not only does work behind the camera, but also as the main character named Sam, gives us a glimpse of New York city circa 1990.  Times seem to be tough, Sam works nights as a bartender and has found (after the death of his dad), that drinking dulls most of the pains.  One of our first introductions with Sam is at a party, where he arrives drunk and continues to drink throughout the course of the evening.  It is during this party that we meet the somewhat sensual Anna, who immediately locks target with Sam.  She entrances him similar to what Dracula did to Miss Mina, but in an eerie role reversal.  They continue their gathering outside, but in Sam's drunken stupor, he misses the opportunity to connect with Anna.  Not to worry vampire lovers, they reconnect after Anna supposedly snacks on one of Sam's friends - and the two begin a very physical courtship.  Oddly, Anna only appears at night, away from friends, and will not tell Sam anything about her.  She bits his lip, he thins its foreplay.  It dramatically changes when Sam seems to get sick over time, forgetting the simplest of tasks, and eventually driving himself mad with scenarios of what Anna may be doing to him.  Of coarse, nobody believes him, so not only does he battle with Anna's vying but also with his friends who seem to believe he is slowly going mad, which becomes the eventual focus to this film.  We are left with this surprising question in our minds as Fessenden ends with anything but your moment of zen.I would like to begin by saying that I thought this was an extremely strong outing for a low-budget director.  I wasn't hoping for Troma level, and I didn't get it.  I wasn't hoping for another repeat of ""Def By Temptation"", and thankfully it never showed.  What I witnessed with this film was an innovated director reinventing an old genre.  Hollywood continues every year to do this type of story, but their moments seem stale and recycled more than innovative and classic.  Fessenden uses his mind and truly makes a terrifying film that questions the basics of the vampire genre and relates them to modern cinema.  It is almost like a horror version of ""Fight Club"" except not as strong.  He uses violence, nudity, and realism to bring this fictional story into the light of New York City taking us to places that are familiar and at most, extremely spooky.  This is not a bad film, but I cannot boast that it is perfect.  It is continually flawed, forcing your to focus on the story because at times the acting is laughable at best and his ""A to B to C"" logic seems too overloaded and detailed.  The acting, outside of the verbal slandering of Aaron Beall's Nick, was just poor.  This could have been tightened up a bit to create stronger scenes between the characters.  I thought Sam was ""acting"" like he was drunk more than he was, the moments of intimacy seemed to be wanted instead of needed, and as we get closer to the end, the moments between Nick and Rae seem distant and lost.  Strength in the words would have tightened up this loose end.Secondly, I had trouble with parts of the story.  I don't want to disregard what Fessenden has done here because I think it is a strong moment in cinematic glory, but just small ends that needed to be less loose.  He started so strong with ""Habit"" that he couldn't keep the momentum flowing until the end.  One of my favorite scenes in the film is when he walks by a artist doing nude photos at night - a moment that seems similar to the movie that we are watching, but I loose it when he goes to Rae's grandmother's house and the Thanksgiving dinner there.  Fessenden also seems a bit loose on the entire ""loosing his father"" moments that seem to peak in and out of existence throughout the film.  I think that it helps us understand Sam's moments of insanity - especially near the end - but we needed more spent towards his father than at the ocean with friends.  There just seemed to be an unbalance in the force.  There are my only two complaints about the film (outside the fact I wished there was a director commentary), because I think Fessenden can do a decent job - just don't go off focus.Overall, I would suggest this film to only a select number of friends - those that appreciate the cinematic art.  I say this because to the unwilling eye, this will look like a cheap ""B"" horror film that teeters on nothing, but I saw so much more than that.  I saw a skilled director revisiting his old work to bring back into the public eye.  This is a great film about vampires, or at least the idea of vampires - but it is not for everyone.  It leaves the story open-ended, giving us a chance to make decisions for ourselves and that, in itself, is what creates the true horror.Oh, what about that goofy video that didn't seem to fit with the film - I guess I could do without that again, but I digress...Grade: *** out of *****",3,What did I get from this film?  #1: Never drink around vampires,1180051200,"05 25, 2007",2007,6208,"['support',

187259,A2AFBVM5O9R09V,1572523557,"Arish ""A+""","[3, 4]","Honestly this isn't a true vampire film but it is an exotic and independent effort. The acting from the main characters was mediocure with the exception of Anna. Anna ws the vampire woman and she wasn't a very good actress. Being that this was her first role it is somewhat excusable. But I will tell you one thing about the directer's choice in casting her. She was very exotic looking and unisex, She was a woman in deed but there was something unusual about her appearance. Through the movie there were hints that she was Bi sexual,but there was never an illustration. Anna was indeed an alluring woman and to some extent made the movie believable and interesting. Basically she had sex with this guy but never told him her secret. In exchange she took a little blood from him each time while they were in ectasy with one another, Way to do it HUh? Well anyway he began to get real sick and drained. And that is when he realized who and what she was doing. When he threatens to leave her and go back to his X that is when the mystery and Mayhem unravels! Anna doesn't take No for an answer in this film. But the sad part about it all she was lonley and she really loved him but she didn't give him a choice. I think this is a good movie, but you have to except that this is a sick love story not a horror movie.Arish",4,In a league of it's on!...Not Horror ..A Sick Love Story!,1043107200,"01 21, 2003",2003,1319,"['Honestly', ""n't"", 'true', 'vampire', 'film', 'exotic', 'independent', 'effort', 'acting', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'mediocure', 'exception', 'Anna', 'Anna', 'ws', 'vampire', 'woman', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'actress', 'Being', 'was', 'first', 'role', 'somewhat', 'excusable', 'will', 'tell', 'one', 'thing', 'directer', 'choice', 'casting', 'was', 'very', 'exotic', 'looking', 'unisex', 'was', 'woman', 'deed', 'was', 'something', 'unusual', 'appearance', 'movie', 'were', 'hints', 'was', 'Bi', 'sexual', 'was', 'never', 'illustration', 'Anna', 'was', 'indeed', 'alluring', 'woman', 'extent', 'made', 'movie', 'believable', 'interesting', 'Basically', 'had', 'sex', 'guy', 'never', 'told', 'secret', 'exchange', 'took', 'little', 'blood', 'time', 'were', 'ectasy', 'one', 'Way', 'do', 'HUh', 'Well', 'anyway', 'began', 'get', 'real', 'sick', 'drained', 'when', 'realized', 'who', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'When', 'leave', 'go', 'back', 'X', 'when', 'mystery', 'Mayhem', 'unravels', 'Anna', ""n't"", 'take', 'No', 'answer', 'film', 'sad', 'part', 'was', 'lonley', 'really', 'loved', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'choice', 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'have', 'except', 'sick', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'horror', 'movie.Arish']",N/A

Ms. Snaider is quietly seductive, sensual, and extremely agressive when necessary. She is coy yet unsettling, w/ a hidden quality of darkness and mystery. When she goes after her prey, they do the business like beasts! Languid movies like EMBRACE OF THE VAMPIRE could have used the same sort of heat generated by Snaider and Fessenden. Meredith Snaider is a bit of a mystery-woman herself, having vanished totally from the face of the earth (just try finding her!). She has disappeared, much like Candace Hilligoss (Carnival Of Souls, The Curse Of The Living Corpse) and Jenny Wright (Near Dark, I Madman). Of course, even Hilligoss and Wright have some evidence of their existence available, whereas Ms. Snaider is simply gone. Too bad, as she is fabulous in her only movie appearance!

187261,AJDQ5EBQNDGLF,1572523557,Bob L,"[4, 4]","Well, it's been about five years since I've seen Habit but it's always stuck with me. I plan to buy the DVD and was a liitle put put back by some of the reviews that went so, so deep into the plot. Reviews should be about what the film did to you not what the film was about. At least not specifically and not in great detail, at least not without first warning the reader.Well what I got from the flick was something new as far as experiences. I'm looking at this guy who's hair is falling out right in front of me and is he???yeah he's missing some teeth.Is this our HERO, is this our protagonist? Some said the acting was bad. I don't know but what I saw was the complete absence of acting. I mean, man, this was FRESH ! ! I thought I was watching a real party in action. I was floored to find out that Larry was the everything to this little gem, writer, director, star and who knows what else.Now, I am a big fan of horror movies but I've never been much of a fan of vampire movies. I didn't like Bela or Christopher or even The Addiction, which was heavily touted. I find most of them to be really cornball. The few exceptions are of course Murnau's Nosferatu and few others but for me not much exist in the genre between 1922 and 1997.A bunch of people mention(even the good reviews) that it's slow but I don't remember that. I think maybe my memory is not serving me right or it was just that I found the whole thing so engrossing, time had no relevance(a real good indication of good filmmaking).The best I can do to explain it is Little Fugitive meets Shadow of the Vampire. Somewhere in between that you'll find  this most indie of Indie films, Habit. If you liked Slacker or Smithereens or Shadows or Kenneth Angers' films or Laws of Gravity or Repo Man or even Return to Salem's Lot, you might find this very satisfying. This is a real good answer to what ""slick"" really is when compared to, let's say, Jerry Bruckhiemer sense of ""slick"" which is really only ""gloss"". Well, I hope memory served me well enough to be seeing the gem I vaguely remember and I hope I don't let you down if I spurred your curiousity enough to watch this very different experience. If I remember correctly, it's well worth the time. All 112 mins.(Addendum)I got it and memory serve me very well but I did forget how much sex(for my money, really good)there is in this hot little movie that puts to shame so many productions costing ten or even a hundred times as much. As much as I like Innocent Blood and Devil's Advocate, this is a much better movie on a small fraction of the budget. This ain't cornball.

The Addiction might seem ""pretentious"" but only if you see nothing entertaining in the concept of a Christopher Walken portraying a vampire who spouts off like a graduate student in philosophy.And what the Amazon reviewer fails to acknowledge is that Nadja and The Addiction are both vampire films.

The story is not necessarily what it seems, or perhaps it is, it's for the viewer to interpret. Sam may indeed be the prey of the mysterious and beautiful vampire, Anna; or he may be imagining more than there is due to his own draining excesses of despair, loss, isolation, and alcoholism. This is what makes the film so interesting. If you want a cut and dry, highly special effect-laden vampire flick, this is likely not for you. For those that like their mind challenged, see it.Filmed on a relatively low budget (and based on an earlier video work) Larry Fessenden has achieved a more engrossing film than I've seen on the big budget screen (as an example, while ""The Hulk"" was a nice exercise in special fx, it bored me in comparison to ""Habit""). Habit's history is nicely chronicled in the bonus features on the DVD.Meredith Snaider is wonderful as the mysterious Anna. She remains a mystery in life. All we know about her in the bios included in the disc is that this is her only film; there is no background info on her at all; I did, however, learn that she became a social worker in real life after this film. I hope she is aware that her talent is truly appreciated in her one screen appearance.Amaze your friends, invite them for a showing of a truly innovative and often disturbing film.

The theme of collapse when combined with lead characters whose emotional environment is one of isolation gives the story its momentum and intensity.  Add to that some truly eerie imagery and sudden, startling occurrences that make the viewer wonder if what happens is actually supernatural or a product of the leading man's (Fessenden) bleary psychology and you have a real gem of a film.Fessenden, upset and confused by the death of his father, takes to alcohol on occasion in an attempt to move away from reality.  It's really a reinforcement of his alienation; he also separates from his girlfriend and so, credibly, is open to another woman who comes into his life both unexpectedly and sensually.  His isolation is not tested because the woman does not demand anything of him emotionally.  Their meetings grow quickly more sexually ferocious, simultaneously with the onset of strange disturbances that nevertheless don't prevent the man from wanting the woman--all the more, in fact.Both the development and the ending are strong.

187271,A2M1N8G4W4END8,1572523557,Michael R Gates,"[22, 23]","Over the past fifteen years or so, talented indie writer and auteur Larry Fessenden has earned a reputation for creating high-quality, highly aesthetic films within the constraints of extremely meager budgets.  Many of his films have been short works and have, unfortunately, gone unnoticed by the public at large, but in recent years, he has written and directed a handful of low-budget but high-quality feature-length horror films that have pushed him further and further into the limelight.  HABIT is the second of these films, and it is his first work to have garnered both a high level of public attention and major critical acclaim (including a three-star ""thumbs-up"" from the venerable Roger Ebert).The movie examines a small slice from the life of Sam (portrayed by the writer/director himself), a somewhat hapless part-time nightclub manager who has just split with his live-in girlfriend.  At the Halloween party of some friends, a drunk and grungy Sam is inexplicably singled out by the attractive yet dark and ethereal Anna.  In spite of the seeming mismatch, one thing leads to another, and Sam hastily plunges into a hot but reckless sexual relationship at the urging of this mysterious dark-haired beauty.  During the next few weeks, they have sex in a park, sex on the rooftop of a New York apartment building, sex in a hospital examination room, and sex in numerous other bizarre situations and places.  It isn't that Sam has a problem with copulating in risky environs; it's just that he's a bit put off by Anna's habit of biting and nipping him during the act.  After every lovemaking session, Sam falls into a deep sleep, only to wake up the next morning, alone, with a new collection of bloody scrapes or bite-marks somewhere on his bod.Sam has been feeling week and sickly as of late, though he at first attributes it to late-night work schedules and excessive drinking.  But when his close friends start openly commenting on his increasingly gaunt appearance--or pointing out the freakish cuts and bites all over his arms and face--a light clicks on in his head. It suddenly dawns on him that he's never seen Anna in the daylight, he's never known her to perform common bodily functions like peeing or taking a crap, and he's never seen her eat or drink anything...that is, anything other than blood--HIS blood!  As crazy as it seems, Sam can't help but ponder the possibility that Anna might be a vampire.Once the vampirism seed in planted in Sam's own alcohol-saturated, sleep-deprived gray matter, he's unable to shake it off, even when his good friend Nick (Aaron Beall) points out the blatant absurdity of the idea.  And the more obsessed Sam becomes with his belief, the more Anna reveals her true undead, bloodsucking nature.  Or does she?Fessenden is a master at subtly weaving the main themes of his stories into scenes that appear to be little more than visual records of common, everyday details.  Perhaps it can be attributed to the human propensity for voyeurism, but these slice-of-life scenes are usually written and acted out with such objectivity and realism that the audience is compelled to keep watching, unaware that they are subliminally soaking up Fessenden's real message or theme.  Then, when the audience is unwittingly hooked, Fessenden reels 'em in to an intensely emotional climax.Now, even though the closing scene of HABIT is quite intense, it is still ambiguous enough to leave the movie open to interpretation.  As mentioned above, the surface details of his films are starkly realistic and objective, but Fessenden nonetheless has a strong predilection for building these details around subtle and subjective themes.  When a film reaches its conclusion, Fessenden wants the audience to discover for themselves--or, more accurately, to DECIDE for themselves--the underlying truth of that final scene, how that truth re-colors earlier events in the film, and what that truth ultimately means for the film's primary characters.In one of the ""making-of"" featurettes on the HABIT DVD, Fessenden refers to this approach as his version of ""interactive"" cinema.  This is a sort of cyberpunk way of saying that, like an expressionist painting or a cubist sculpture, a movie is more satisfying for the viewer if they have to do a little thinking and decide for themselves what the filmmakers are trying to say.  Films that do so become more personal, more moving, and ultimately more important to the individual viewer.  With HABIT, Fessenden excellently bears out this theory.  The audience is allowed to decide on their own if Anna is a vampire or if Sam is just experiencing a mental breakdown.  And interestingly enough, the details of the film are such that a cogent argument can be made for either interpretation, or even for a combination of the two.The DVD from Fox Lorber/Glass Eye Pix offers a great transfer of HABIT in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1. The disc also contains the original theatrical trailer, several mini ""making-of"" featurettes, and a really cool music video for the song SAVE YOU FROM YOURSELF by Just Desserts, one of the songs featured in the film.  (Larry Fessenden plays sax for Just Desserts, and he also worked on the filmmaking side of the humorous video featured on the disc.)Indie films don't get much better than HABIT, and it will make a fantastic addition to the collection of any horror fan or film lover.  And at amazon.com's excellent asking price for the DVD, it's a real steal!",5,The Lady IS a Vamp...Isn't She?,1076544000,"02 12, 2004",2004,5475,"['past', 'fifteen', 'years', 'so', 'talented',

It is a testimony to both the writing and the acting that the ultimately catastophic nature of the character's flaws is done with such tenderness, humor and compassion. Fessenden loves his rouges, his demi-monde, and can portray their minor heroism with great humanity. This film does what horror was meant to do -- it makes the protagonist, not the monster, the center of the story and allows his faults and talents to determine his fate.  Fessenden uses the camera deftly, employing clever angles, intimate positioning and wondeful visuals. The film does suffer somewhat from a low-budget video quality but based on the significant attributes of this work, Fessenden will, I'm sure, secure a higher budget with future projects. He deserves it.",4,Well Crafted Character Study,988588800,"04 30, 2001",2001,1156,"['Writer/Director/Actor', 'Larry', 'Fessenden', 'created', 'minor', 'masterpiece', 'compelling', 'movie', 'film', 'deals', 'vampires', 'classified', 'horror', 'objective', 'do', 'far', 'more', 'merely', 'frighten', 'titilate', 'Rich', 'well-crafted', 'characters', 'vibrant', 'dialog', 'hapless', 'denizens', 'Fessenden', 'world', 'are', 'utterly', 'believable', 'relaitionships', 'conversations', 'completely', 'convincing', 'testimony', 'writing', 'acting', 'ultimately', 'catastophic', 'nature', 'character', 'flaws', 'done', 'such', 'tenderness', 'humor', 'compassion', 'Fessenden', 'rouges', 'demi-monde', 'can', 'portray', 'minor', 'heroism', 'great', 'humanity', 'film', 'what', 'horror', 'was', 'meant', 'do', 'protagonist', 'not', 'monster', 'center', 'story', 'faults', 'talents', 'determine', 'fate', 'Fessenden', 'camera', 'deftly', 'employing', 'clever', 'angles', 'intimate', 'positioning', 'wondeful', 'visuals', 'film', 'suffer', 'somewhat', 'low-budget', 'video', 'quality', 'based', 'significant', 'attributes', 'work', 'Fessenden', 'will', ""'m"", 'sure', 'secure', 'higher', 'budget', 'future', 'projects']",N/A

Yes, I know that is harsh, but I truthfully can find nothing of value in the 112 minutes of my life I wasted watching this film.""Habit"" is the stilted and passionless story of Sam, his ex-girlfriend Liza, friends Nick and Rae, and new squeeze du jour Anna.  He meets Anna at a Halloween party, and when next he meets up with her they have a ""bout of fun"" in the park and she bites him on the lip.Anna pops up now and then, couples with Sam, Sam's friends get concerned, Sam gets sick, and on to the anticlimactic ending from there.Usually there is some redeeming quality in even the worst of films, for instance, ""Queen Of The Damned"" was a poor movie but used very attractive actors and sets, and had a killer soundtrack.""Habit"" uses very unattractive actors (couldn't they have bought this guy a dental bridge for the role?) who are as untalented as they are unattractive, a horrid folksy soundtrack, stilted and repetitive dialogue, mediocre photography, and skittish editing.  The supposedly wonderful ""knockin boots"" scenes are atrocious, it's like watching Chester and Trudy from the trailer park get it on in the automotive aisle at Walmart.  Disgusting!  And as for the vampire angle, I remember seeing more fangs and blood in The Lion King.When the cat does the best acting in a movie, and the most exciting scene is the extended close-up of a ticking clock, and you spend your whole time trying not to look at the huge gap in the lead's teeth, it's time to eject and grab up a copy of Innocent Blood or The Hunger.So do yourself a favor and rent this first if you are considering a purchase, or even better, back slowly away from it and count yourself lucky to have missed it.",1,"Tedious and lackluster vampire film with no teeth, literally",1095552000,"09 19, 2004",2004,1759,"['Habit', 'simply', 'awful', 'movie', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'whatsoever', 'Yes', 'know', 'harsh', 'truthfully', 'can', 'find', 'nothing', 'value', '112', 'minutes', 'life', 'wasted', 'watching', 'film', 'Habit', 'stilted', 'passionless', 'story', 'Sam', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Liza', 'Nick', 'Rae', 'new', 'squeeze', 'du', 'jour', 'Anna', 'Anna', 'Halloween', 'party', 'when', 'next', 'up', 'have', 'bout', 'fun', 'park', 'lip.Anna', 'up', 'now', 'then', 'couples', 'Sam', 'Sam', 'friends', 'get', 'concerned', 'Sam', 'sick', 'anticlimactic', 'ending', 'there.Usually', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'even', 'worst', 'films', 'instance', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'was', 'poor', 'movie', 'used', 'very', 'attractive', 'actors', 'sets', 'had', 'killer', 'soundtrack', 'Habit', 'very', 'unattractive', 'actors', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'bought', 'guy', 'dental', 'bridge', 'role', 'who', 'are', 'as', 'untalented', 'are', 'unattractive', 'horrid', 'folksy', 'soundtrack', 'stilted', 'repetitive', 'dialogue', 'mediocre', 'photography', 'skittish', 'editing', 'supposedly', 'wonderful', 'knockin', 'boots', 'scenes', 'are', 'atrocious', 'watching', 'Chester', 'Trudy', 'trailer', 'park', 'get', 'automotive', 'aisle', 'Walmart', 'Disgusting', 'vampire', 'angle', 'remember', 'seeing', 'more', 'fangs', 'blood', 'Lion', 'King.When', 'cat', 'best', 'acting', 'movie', 'most', 'exciting', 'scene', 'extended', 'close-up', 'ticking', 'clock', 'spend', 'whole', 'time', 'trying', 'not', 'look', 'huge', 'gap', 'lead', 'teeth', 'time', 'eject', 'grab', 'up', 'copy', 'Innocent', 'Blood', 'Hunger.So', 'do', 'favor', 'rent', 'first', 'are', 'considering', 'purchase', 'even', 'better', 'back', 'slowly', 'away', 'count', 'lucky', 'have', 'missed']",N/A

This movie is certainly an experience, after I saw it I wasn't sure what to make of it.  It's not a horror film, but there were a few scenes that genuinely scared me (not an easy task).  The end of the film left me utterly shell-shocked.  It's a romantic film, but not in the sense most people consider romantic; it's very dark and twisted and REAL, and I think that's what makes this movie more romantic than many mainstream films that try so hard to idealize love.  Real love is often gritty and difficult, just like this film.  The pace is slow and there is very little violence, so this movie is definitly not for most horror fans, yet it is very dark and twisted so it not for fans of drama either.  I think this film has a definite niche among independent film fans who just want a really well told story that keeps them thinking about it days after the movie is over. Certainly worth a look for serious movie affecionados, but not for your average action-film watching yahoo.",4,"Intriguing, tense, and unique.",1081123200,"04 5, 2004",2004,1086,"['Caught', 'one', 'independent', 'film', 'channel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'vampire', 'movie', 'gave', 'try', 'movie', 'certainly', 'experience', 'saw', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'genuinely', 'scared', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'end', 'film', 'left', 'utterly', 'shell-shocked', 'romantic', 'film', 'not', 'sense', 'most', 'people', 'consider', 'romantic', 'very', 'dark', 'twisted', 'REAL', 'think', 'what', 'movie', 'more', 'romantic', 'many', 'mainstream', 'films', 'try', 'so', 'hard', 'idealize', 'love', 'Real', 'love', 'often', 'gritty', 'difficult', 'just', 'film', 'pace', 'slow', 'very', 'little', 'violence', 'movie', 'definitly', 'not', 'most', 'horror', 'fans', 'very', 'dark', 'twisted', 'so', 'not', 'fans', 'drama', 'think', 'film', 'definite', 'niche', 'independent', 'film', 'fans', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'really', 'well', 'told', 'story', 'thinking', 'days', 'movie', 'Certainly', 'look', 'serious', 'movie', 'affecionados', 'not', 'average', 'action-film', 'watching', 'yahoo']",N/A
