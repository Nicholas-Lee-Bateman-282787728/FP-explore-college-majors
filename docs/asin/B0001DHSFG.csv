801055,A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0,B0001DHSFG,"Deb Nam-Krane ""dnkboston""","[1, 1]","I had high hopes for this release.  Although there are plenty of Pilates releases these days that stress the strength building and even flexibility inherent in Pilates.  Few, however, are sequenced to get at the cardio benefits that the practice can give you.  Sadly, this one doesn't either.  Instead, this is a straight up Pilates mat practice followed by a simply choreographed standing cardio segment.The Pilates practice itself is a moderately-paced, intermediate practice with a few advanced movements, such as the Side Bend, thrown in.  Although it does feature the Side Kicks, it only uses two variations.  I found this particularly disappointing, since I usually find that those are the mat movements that produce the most sweat.The standing cardio is, as other people have said, repetitive, based on marches but also including some jacks, scissor lunges and balance movements.  It's fine- it will get your heart rate up- but it isn't very interesting.In addition to the matwork, there are plenty of lunges, squats and standing movements from the classical Pilates syllabus that could have been included in the standing cardio to give it a more, well, Pilates feel.  As it is, it's fine, but I'd recommend a shorter mat-based workout (one of Romana's releases, perhaps) and another short cardio over this one.",3,"Great concept, disappointing execution",1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,1318,"['had', 'high', 'hopes', 'release', 'are', 'plenty', 'Pilates', 'days', 'stress', 'strength', 'building', 'even', 'flexibility', 'inherent', 'Pilates', 'Few', 'however', 'are', 'sequenced', 'get', 'cardio', 'benefits', 'practice', 'can', 'give', 'Sadly', 'one', ""n't"", 'either', 'Instead', 'straight', 'up', 'Pilates', 'mat', 'practice', 'followed', 'simply', 'choreographed', 'standing', 'cardio', 'segment.The', 'Pilates', 'practice', 'moderately-paced', 'intermediate', 'practice', 'few', 'advanced', 'movements', 'such', 'Side', 'Bend', 'thrown', 'feature', 'Side', 'Kicks', 'only', 'two', 'variations', 'found', 'particularly', 'disappointing', 'usually', 'find', 'are', 'mat', 'movements', 'produce', 'most', 'sweat.The', 'standing', 'cardio', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'repetitive', 'based', 'marches', 'also', 'including', 'jacks', 'scissor', 'lunges', 'balance', 'movements', 'fine-', 'will', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up-', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting.In', 'addition', 'matwork', 'are', 'plenty', 'lunges', 'squats', 'standing', 'movements', 'classical', 'Pilates', 'syllabus', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'standing', 'cardio', 'give', 'more', 'well', 'Pilates', 'feel', 'fine', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'shorter', 'mat-based', 'workout', 'one', 'Romana', 'releases', 'perhaps', 'short', 'cardio', 'one']",Cardio Pilates
801056,A34UCP9NIG0I9T,B0001DHSFG,DJ,"[0, 0]","I have been doing pilates off and on as much as I can for the past two to three years and I used to do aerobics/cardio several times a week when I still had a gym membership. The pilates segment is very good. I have only done the dvd once, but it gave me a really good abs workout. The cardio/aerobics section was really more for doing a simple cardio workout for someone who is used to doing only pilates. I haven't been doing cardio a lot recently, so I bought this and it got my heartrate up, but it wouldn't be good for someone who does cardio on a regular basis. I would suggest getting this if you are like me and don't do cardio but would like to start. The cardio segment emphasizes how to use your core in aerobics, but the moves are quite basic. You might use this as a beginner video for cardio and then get something more cardio based as you move on. I would like to emphasize that the pilates segment is great and a good intermediate workout for someone bored with beginning workouts. It introduced me to a few pilates moves I hadn't done before and I will definitely use this dvd several times throughout the week. Also, I love Ana Caban, the instructor, although she does seem to be a bit too cheery during the cardio segment. This might come from the fact that she normally only does pilates videos, but she is always great at explaining moves and motivating you.",4,the Pilates is good,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,1379,"['have', 'been', 'doing', 'pilates', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'past', 'two', 'three', 'years', 'used', 'do', 'aerobics/cardio', 'several', 'times', 'week', 'when', 'still', 'had', 'gym', 'membership', 'pilates', 'segment', 'very', 'good', 'have', 'only', 'done', 'dvd', 'once', 'gave', 'really', 'good', 'abs', 'workout', 'cardio/aerobics', 'section', 'was', 'really', 'more', 'doing', 'simple', 'cardio', 'workout', 'someone', 'who', 'used', 'doing', 'only', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'doing', 'cardio', 'lot', 'recently', 'bought', 'got', 'heartrate', 'up', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'someone', 'who', 'cardio', 'regular', 'basis', 'would', 'suggest', 'getting', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'cardio', 'would', 'like', 'start', 'cardio', 'segment', 'how', 'use', 'core', 'aerobics', 'moves', 'are', 'quite', 'basic', 'might', 'use', 'beginner', 'video', 'cardio', 'then', 'get', 'something', 'more', 'cardio', 'based', 'move', 'would', 'like', 'emphasize', 'pilates', 'segment', 'great', 'good', 'intermediate', 'workout', 'someone', 'bored', 'beginning', 'workouts', 'introduced', 'few', 'moves', 'had', ""n't"", 'done', 'will', 'definitely', 'use', 'dvd', 'several', 'times', 'week', 'Also', 'love', 'Ana', 'Caban', 'instructor', 'seem', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'cheery', 'cardio', 'segment', 'might', 'come', 'fact', 'normally', 'only', 'pilates', 'videos', 'always', 'great', 'explaining', 'moves', 'motivating']",Cardio Pilates

The pilates segment is decent and purposeful, but the cardio is dull and repetitive and a far cry from challenging. As another review already states, you do the same few rounds of cardio moves over and over. While repetitiveness works for some, it doesn't for most. I personally had a very difficult time getting through this whole workout..I just didn't find that I was benefiting from it.Plus, I just couldn't decide what was more annoying, the music or the instructor's perky grin as she bounced around rather stupidly to the music.If you want pilates, I'd recommend Denise Austin's ""Pilates for Every Body"" or ""Hit the Spot Pilates"" or either of the New York City Ballet workouts.",3,No. Just no.,1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,790,"['mix', 'pilates', 'cardio', 'nice', 'know', 'unfortunately', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'letdown', 'pilates', 'segment', 'decent', 'purposeful', 'cardio', 'dull', 'repetitive', 'far', 'cry', 'challenging', 'review', 'already', 'do', 'same', 'few', 'rounds', 'cardio', 'moves', 'over', 'repetitiveness', 'works', ""n't"", 'most', 'personally', 'had', 'very', 'difficult', 'time', 'getting', 'whole', 'workout..I', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'was', 'benefiting', 'it.Plus', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'what', 'was', 'more', 'annoying', 'music', 'instructor', 'perky', 'grin', 'bounced', 'rather', 'stupidly', 'music.If', 'want', 'pilates', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'Pilates', 'Body', 'Hit', 'Spot', 'Pilates', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Ballet', 'workouts']",Cardio Pilates

801062,A2KW2XGFYJU4VE,B0001DHSFG,"Shelley K. Gilbertson ""ssgilby""","[6, 7]","I consider myself a strong intermediate pilates student, and thought the pilates portion of this video to be pretty standard. There is minimal instruction on form and technique (although she does throw in reminders from time to time), so it would not be a good choice for a beginner.  Ana keeps the exercises flowing, which I appreciated, but at times I would preferred a few more reps.The cardio portion, however, was not so great.  For anyone even the slightest bit beyond very beginner, it is nothing more than a warm up.  Unforunately it comes at the end of the video!  This is not a fusion of cardio and pilates, but rather two separate sections.  The cardio follows the pilates, and actually, I would've preferred it to come before the pilates.  (If I were keeping the video - it's going back to the library - I would definitely do the cardio first.)  As one reviewer mentioned, it is very repetitious (in fact I developed a pain at the back of each shoulder from the repetitive arm work) and not strenuous.  Ana seems sweet enough, and her pilates form looks great, but she apparently can't keep the beat (or she wasn't listening to the same music as is on the soundtrack).  I had a hard time staying in sync with her, mostly when she was marching in place.  She also was off count at times, saying we'd do 8 reps but then would only do 4.Overall, if you've got some pilates experience and want the cardio more to get the blood and breath flowing rather than give you a great w/o, give it a try.  It's not a bad workout, just nothing I'm interested in keeping.Shelley G.",3,Just Okay,1148428800,"05 24, 2006",2006,1577,"['consider', 'strong', 'intermediate', 'pilates', 'student', 'thought', 'pilates', 'portion', 'video', 'be', 'pretty', 'standard', 'minimal', 'instruction', 'form', 'technique', 'throw', 'reminders', 'time', 'time', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'choice', 'beginner', 'Ana', 'exercises', 'flowing', 'appreciated', 'times', 'would', 'preferred', 'few', 'more', 'reps.The', 'cardio', 'portion', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'anyone', 'even', 'slightest', 'bit', 'very', 'beginner', 'nothing', 'more', 'warm', 'up', 'end', 'video', 'not', 'fusion', 'cardio', 'pilates', 'rather', 'two', 'separate', 'sections', 'cardio', 'pilates', 'actually', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'come', 'pilates', 'were', 'keeping', 'video', 'going', 'back', 'library', 'would', 'definitely', 'do', 'cardio', 'first', 'one', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'very', 'repetitious', 'fact', 'developed', 'pain', 'back', 'shoulder', 'repetitive', 'arm', 'work', 'not', 'strenuous', 'Ana', 'sweet', 'enough', 'pilates', 'form', 'great', 'apparently', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'beat', 'was', ""n't"", 'listening', 'same', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'staying', 'sync', 'mostly', 'when', 'was', 'marching', 'place', 'also', 'was', 'off', 'count', 'times', 'saying', ""'d"", 'do', '8', 'reps', 'then', 'would', 'only', 'do', '4.Overall', ""'ve"", 'got', 'pilates', 'experience', 'want', 'cardio', 'more', 'get', 'blood', 'breath', 'flowing', 'rather', 'give', 'great', 'w/o', 'give', 'try', 'not', 'bad', 'workout', 'just', 'nothing', ""'m"", 'interested', 'keeping.Shelley', 'G']",Cardio Pilates
