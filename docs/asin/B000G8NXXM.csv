I laugh at him just jumping around on stage like he does... especially when he gets laughing at himself, and he does!  This particular DVD was good, but not quite as good as The Pimp Ones.  I liked this and glad I got it for some of the material is different, but I LOVE the Pimp ones - I ordered those too.If you want to laugh, and can laugh at everyone and everything, this is the guy!",3,This Guy Is Funny and Always Makes Me Laugh!,1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,510,"['really', 'Katt', 'just', 'funny', 'have', 'laugh', 'can', 'talk', 'color', 'anyone', 'anything', 'funny', 'laugh', 'just', 'jumping', 'around', 'stage', 'especially', 'when', 'laughing', 'particular', 'DVD', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Pimp', 'Ones', 'liked', 'glad', 'got', 'material', 'different', 'LOVE', 'Pimp', 'ones', 'ordered', 'too.If', 'want', 'laugh', 'can', 'laugh', 'everyone', 'everything', 'guy']",Katt Williams: Live

This had about 98% the exact same material performed in front of a different audience and in full screen. So I found it to be a waste of money. It's one thing for comedians to repeat a joke or two as a filler an to repeat the same material for new audience, but to release it twice? What a way to screw us out our money! So if you ownThe Pimp Chronicles Part 1, then this would be a waste of money, if you ask me. Either release, the comedy is hilarious and worthy of 5 stars but this specific DVD only gets 2 because it's the same. It's a waste of money if you haveThe Pimp Chronicles Part 1. But if don't have either, go with this one, as there are a couple extra and extended jokes.",2,A waste of money,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,749,"['ownThe', 'Pimp', 'Chronicles', 'Part', '1then', 'should', 'avoid', 'had', '98', '%', 'exact', 'same', 'material', 'performed', 'front', 'different', 'audience', 'full', 'screen', 'found', 'be', 'waste', 'money', 'one', 'thing', 'comedians', 'repeat', 'joke', 'two', 'filler', 'repeat', 'same', 'material', 'new', 'audience', 'release', 'twice', 'What', 'way', 'screw', 'out', 'money', 'So', 'ownThe', 'Pimp', 'Chronicles', 'Part', '1', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'waste', 'money', 'ask', 'release', 'comedy', 'hilarious', 'worthy', '5', 'stars', 'specific', 'DVD', 'only', '2', 'same', 'waste', 'money', 'haveThe', 'Pimp', 'Chronicles', 'Part', '1', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'go', 'one', 'are', 'couple', 'extra', 'extended', 'jokes']",Katt Williams: Live

999427,AD3WV8EHGVKH5,B000G8NXXM,Lady Di,"[2, 2]","First time I really paid attention to him was about 2 weeks ago when Comedy Central was airing this Live set. I came in on the middle and stayed since they keep showing encore information while watching. Man, I laughed soooooooooo hard I choked several times. I think my only disappointment was that his baseball cap was too low in his face and therefore you miss the very necessary facial expressions seen during his delivery. The camera operator did do just by trying to get some close-ups, but when this man is moving, he IS moving. He's all over the stage - literally. This is the second best of the DVD's containing added an Hometown racially charged moment that was taking place at the time of his arrival, his Proclamation from the city and his parents are featured too. With that bit of personal side added, you see he's not JUST a comedian but a force surely to be reckoned with. Not quite as funny as Pimp Chronicles Part 1 but not far from it either. I hope his (newer) material gets better and his hunger gets stronger.

Call me a hater if you want(which I'm sure you will), but dude is NOT funny.  His HBO special was worse than Mike Epps (who I happen to think is hilarious) and now all we need is for Chris Tucker (also hilarious) to lay an egg on HBO so the Friday Sidekick Circle can be complete. Not only is he corny, but Williams has been bleeding this ""pimp"" routine ever since his role on Friday After Next and it's getting -- no, scratch that -- it got old about 3 years ago. While his role in Friday After Next was somewhat funny, this DVD is totally unfunny. He may tell a joke here or there that might make you chuckle, but nothing here will make you laugh.I have to ask though, was he doing these jokes BEFORE he did Friday After Next?
