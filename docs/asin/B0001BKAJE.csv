His are NOT action films that involve two hours of blowing things up and wildly destructive automobile chases.  That fact we must clarify right at the start.  His films are somewhat dry and slow moving, but packed with deep insight into the human condition and what makes us tick.This specific film highlights an aspect of human life all too common in North America today.  I refer to the negative impact that living without one or both biological parents can have on children.  This is particularly true when, in the aftermath of divorce, the parents differ on how the children should be raised and/or use the children as weapons against each other.In this case, we have a family split by politics, which adds another layer of interested to this story.Here we find 32 year old Roberto returning to Cuba for the first time since his father had taken him from the island as a young child.  Now a professor in the United States, he has come to find his mother and also to discover his motherland.  Neither one is easy for him to find.  Reunited with his cousin, Pilar, the two embark on a road trip across the island in search of Carmen, Roberto's biological mother.Jorge Perugorr&iacute;a has established himself as one of the most talented and capable actors in the world today.  Mario Limonta & Isabel Santos give excellent performances.  I enjoyed the all too brief appearances of Saturnino Garcia and Paula Al&iacute;, who are among my very favorite Cuban actors.It's a touching film.  Very moving.  It shows us many sides of Cuba today.  And it also shows us many sides of ourselves.",4,Another wonderful insight into the Cuban soul,1219795200,"08 27, 2008",2008,1720,"['First', 'must', 'be', 'understood', 'Humberto', 'Sol', 'aacute', 's', 'not', 'make', 'films', 'style', 'most', 'familiar', 'North', 'American', 'audiences', 'are', 'NOT', 'action', 'films', 'involve', 'two', 'hours', 'blowing', 'things', 'up', 'wildly', 'destructive', 'automobile', 'chases', 'fact', 'must', 'clarify', 'right', 'start', 'films', 'are', 'somewhat', 'dry', 'slow', 'moving', 'packed', 'deep', 'insight', 'human', 'condition', 'what', 'tick.This', 'specific', 'film', 'highlights', 'aspect', 'human', 'life', 'too', 'common', 'North', 'America', 'today', 'refer', 'negative', 'impact', 'living', 'one', 'biological', 'parents', 'can', 'have', 'children', 'particularly', 'true', 'when', 'aftermath', 'divorce', 'parents', 'differ', 'how', 'children', 'should', 'be', 'raised', 'and/or', 'children', 'weapons', 'other.In', 'case', 'have', 'family', 'split', 'politics', 'layer', 'interested', 'story.Here', 'find', '32', 'year', 'old', 'Roberto', 'returning', 'Cuba', 'first', 'time', 'father', 'had', 'taken', 'island', 'young', 'child', 'Now', 'professor', 'United', 'States', 'come', 'find', 'mother', 'also', 'discover', 'motherland', 'one', 'easy', 'find', 'Reunited', 'cousin', 'Pilar', 'two', 'embark', 'road', 'trip', 'island', 'search', 'Carmen', 'Roberto', 'biological', 'mother.Jorge', 'Perugorr', 'iacute', 'established', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'capable', 'actors', 'world', 'today', 'Mario', 'Limonta', 'Isabel', 'Santos', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'enjoyed', 'too', 'brief', 'appearances', 'Saturnino', 'Garcia', 'Paula', 'Al', 'iacute', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'favorite', 'Cuban', 'actors.It', 'touching', 'film', 'Very', 'moving', 'many', 'sides', 'Cuba', 'today', 'also', 'many', 'sides', 'ourselves']",N/A

The movie itself was film sparingly, straight forward no fancy effects.  Jorge Perugorria is right on in portraying the  41 yr old, Latin Literature teacher from Maimi in search of the mother who he's always thought abandoned him.  When he first finds out that he was literary ripped out of his mother's arms in contrary to what his now deceased father has always told him, that his mother didn't care about going with him to America, he started to loath the lies his dead father has told him.  But like everything else, he discovers that everyone has also suffered, that his own suffering  equals everyone else's.  And this dicovery had brought a certain measure of peace within him.  I love looking at the movie physically because you get to see a little bit of Cuba. The old classic buildings are dilapidated but beautiful, the people are colourful and you can see how everyone is trying to get by with so little.  I also like Isabel Santos, who plays the tour guide cousin.  She's quite intense and reminds one of Ingrid Bergman.  I enjoyed this movie a lot and I cried at the end.  Life can be so sad sometimes and this movie conveys it well.",5,unforced sentimentality,1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,1240,"['love', 'movie', 'what', 'sentimental', 'journey', 'coming', 'terms', 'one', 'longing', 'movie', 'was', 'film', 'sparingly', 'straight', 'forward', 'fancy', 'effects', 'Jorge', 'Perugorria', 'right', 'portraying', '41', 'yr', 'old', 'Latin', 'Literature', 'teacher', 'Maimi', 'search', 'mother', 'who', 'always', 'thought', 'abandoned', 'When', 'first', 'out', 'was', 'literary', 'ripped', 'mother', 'arms', 'contrary', 'what', 'now', 'deceased', 'father', 'always', 'told', 'mother', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'going', 'America', 'started', 'loath', 'lies', 'dead', 'father', 'told', 'everything', 'else', 'everyone', 'also', 'suffered', 'own', 'suffering', 'equals', 'everyone', 'else', 'dicovery', 'had', 'brought', 'certain', 'measure', 'peace', 'love', 'looking', 'movie', 'physically', 'get', 'see', 'little', 'bit', 'Cuba', 'old', 'classic', 'buildings', 'are', 'dilapidated', 'beautiful', 'people', 'are', 'colourful', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'everyone', 'trying', 'get', 'so', 'little', 'also', 'like', 'Isabel', 'Santos', 'who', 'tour', 'guide', 'cousin', 'quite', 'intense', 'one', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'lot', 'cried', 'end', 'Life', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'sad', 'sometimes', 'movie', 'well']",N/A
799270,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0001BKAJE,Grady Harp,"[2, 4]","MIEL PARA OSHUN (Honey for Oshun) is an absorbingly rich and rewarding story about the search for familial roots. As a child, Roberto was sent to Miami with his father when the Revolution took over. Though he longed to return to Cuba for a visit, his father denied that request. Now, after his father's death, Roberto flies to Cuba, looks up his cousin Pilar, learns that his mother did NOT desert him by sending him on the boat to Miami, but indeed loved him and is still alive somewhere in Cuba. With Pilar's support and the good graces of a friendly cab driver (Antonio) the three set off on a seemingly fruitless journey to find Carmen, Roberto's long lost mother. The road trip is far from easy, emotionally and physically, with many barricades along the way, both comic and sad. Eventually, through the help of a Spiritual Woman the three discover the truth about Carmen, about each other, and about life in a country that makes existence a fragile entity.The three actors who dominate the film are excellent and the story line is always driven with forward momentum, never drowning in self-pity or condemning either the Cubans who live on the island or the Cuban Americans who come to visit. The picture is truly three-dimensional. The only problems with the movie (and which keep it from 5 stars) are technical ones: the background noise is so loud that it covers the dialogue (where is the sound editor and his Dolby filter?) and the quality of color is washed out to almost white. In some ways these flaws enhance this beautiful film, as it seems it is made with the scant resources afforded the arts in Cuba.MIEL PARA OSHUN is very worthwhile, gives insights into an Island that remains a mystery to most of us, and celebrates the importance of family - both biological and extended.

799271,A38EF1GOP8A5FO,B0001BKAJE,muskiedine,"[1, 2]","I enjoyed this film about a son who returns to Cuba in search of his mother, whom he's been separated from for over thirty years. Although the film is at times overly dramatic and plays like a soap opera, you still find yourself absorbed in the search. This is a road film and, as such, takes us on a journey. The shots of the Cuban villages and countryside are reason enough to watch.The ending is predictable, but that's okay because we like this kind of predictability. My only criticism is that the director could have handled it better. Basically, it was abrupt and lacked the required intimacy. Otherwise, a warm, heart-felt film with an incredible performance by Isabel Santos. Her performance is evocative of Lena Olin's in ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being.""",4,Good film despite flair for the melodramatic,1153612800,"07 23, 2006",2006,768,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'son', 'who', 'Cuba', 'search', 'mother', 'whom', 'been', 'separated', 'thirty', 'years', 'film', 'times', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'plays', 'soap', 'opera', 'still', 'find', 'absorbed', 'search', 'road', 'film', 'such', 'journey', 'shots', 'Cuban', 'villages', 'countryside', 'are', 'reason', 'enough', 'watch.The', 'ending', 'predictable', 'okay', 'like', 'kind', 'predictability', 'only', 'criticism', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'handled', 'better', 'Basically', 'was', 'abrupt', 'lacked', 'required', 'intimacy', 'Otherwise', 'warm', 'heart-felt', 'film', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Isabel', 'Santos', 'performance', 'evocative', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'Unbearable', 'Lightness', 'Being']",N/A
