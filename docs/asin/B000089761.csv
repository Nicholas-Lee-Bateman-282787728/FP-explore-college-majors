It's a movie that warms the heart and it a great family movie. The Locket, The Christmas Box and Timepiece are all wonderful movies by the same Richard Paul Evans and they are a must for all my loved ones. Great pricing on this one as I had been wanting one for me and one for her so couldnt' be happier with this purchase. Great shipping time and the movie plays great. Looking forward to more of these kinds of movies that the whole family can watch together.",5,Heartwarming movie,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,672,"['movie', 'favorite', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'Hallmark', 'channel', 'purchased', 'Aunt', 'Birthday', 'was', 'so', 'tickled', 'finally', 'got', 'see', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'talking', 'movie', 'heart', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'Locket', 'Christmas', 'Box', 'Timepiece', 'are', 'wonderful', 'movies', 'same', 'Richard', 'Paul', 'Evans', 'are', 'must', 'loved', 'ones', 'Great', 'pricing', 'one', 'had', 'been', 'wanting', 'one', 'one', 'so', 'couldnt', 'be', 'happier', 'purchase', 'Great', 'shipping', 'time', 'movie', 'great', 'Looking', 'forward', 'more', 'kinds', 'movies', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'together']",N/A

735872,A358XP3X4U0X45,B000089761,bookloversfriend,"[14, 20]","On the one hand, you have Richard Paul Evans' usual deft deployment of sure-fire heart-tugging material: parents and children, husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends.  This is can't miss material (still, it must be said that a lot of moviemakers manage to miss with it anyway).  In this movie, they work.  It doesn't hurt, of course, that you have a master like Vanessa Redgrave playing one of the major roles.On the other hand, one could wish that Evans (whose field is Public Relations) had not achieved success so easily when he started.  Otherwise, he might have read one or two books on novel-writing and learned the basics.  In this movie, the main character's problems are caused by the main character.  That would be okay if they were unavoidable or excusable.But first, the guy wrecks his relationship with the love of his life because her father tells him it's better for her.  And this type of moralistic man does the ""right"" thing no matter how much it hurts other people.  He also does not confide in her why he's doing this.  It's curious that these two traits of moral rigidity and a nondisclosure that amounts to dishonesty should occur in the same person, yet in life these two are in fact quite often found together.  So, at least it's realistic.  (That doesn't make it good writing, however.)  In fact, he tells her it's best for her.  She tells HIM ""this is best for me"".  He totally discounts this.  He knows what's best for her better than she does.  In other words, he shows himself to be a male chauvinist also.Then, he does stupid things, viz. not reporting a co-worker whom he overhears beating one of the elderly patients.  Then, he does an even stupider thing, after being arrested for murder of this patient, he doesn't tell on her.  Then, he tops that in stupidity: after he has been forbidden by the court from going to the nursing home, he--you guessed it--goes to the nursing home!The reason writing books forbid this kind of thing is that it infuriates the reader or audience.  In this case, it also strains credibility.",3,very mixed bag,1148515200,"05 25, 2006",2006,2062,"['one', 'hand', 'have', 'Richard', 'Paul', 'Evans', 'usual', 'deft', 'deployment', 'sure-fire', 'heart-tugging', 'material', 'parents', 'children', 'husbands', 'wives', 'boyfriends', 'girlfriends', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'material', 'still', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'lot', 'moviemakers', 'manage', 'miss', 'anyway', 'movie', 'work', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'course', 'have', 'master', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'playing', 'one', 'major', 'roles.On', 'other', 'hand', 'one', 'could', 'wish', 'Evans', 'field', 'Public', 'Relations', 'had', 'not', 'achieved', 'success', 'so', 'easily', 'when', 'started', 'Otherwise', 'might', 'have', 'read', 'one', 'two', 'books', 'novel-writing', 'learned', 'basics', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'problems', 'are', 'caused', 'main', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'okay', 'were', 'unavoidable', 'excusable.But', 'first', 'guy', 'relationship', 'love', 'life', 'father', 'better', 'type', 'moralistic', 'man', 'right', 'thing', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'other', 'people', 'also', 'not', 'confide', 'why', 'doing', 'curious', 'two', 'traits', 'moral', 'rigidity', 'nondisclosure', 'dishonesty', 'should', 'occur', 'same', 'person', 'yet', 'life', 'two', 'are', 'fact', 'quite', 'often', 'found', 'together', 'So', 'least', 'realistic', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'writing', 'however', 'fact', 'best', 'HIM', 'best', 'totally', 'what', 'best', 'better', 'other', 'words', 'be', 'male', 'chauvinist', 'also.Then', 'stupid', 'things', 'viz', 'not', 'reporting', 'co-worker', 'whom', 'beating', 'one', 'elderly', 'patients', 'Then', 'even', 'stupider', 'thing', 'being', 'arrested', 'murder', 'patient', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Then', 'stupidity', 'been', 'forbidden', 'court', 'going', 'nursing', 'home', 'guessed', 'nursing', 'home', 'reason', 'writing', 'books', 'forbid', 'kind', 'thing', 'reader', 'audience', 'case', 'also', 'credibility']",N/A

My grandson and I watched it recently, appreciating the tenderness shown by the main character to those he cared for at the nursing facility.

735877,A36283XJO4ODGM,B000089761,puff,"[34, 35]","After reading the Locket, I was pleasantly surprised when I found out it had been made into a movie. The story is about a young man, Michael, who after the death of his mother, gets a job at a nursing home and befriends an elderly woman Ester who changes his life for the better and shows him what faith and forgivenss are all about. MIchael has to go through many trials in his young life, but decides to become better, not bitter from them. The book is definitely better, so I would recommend reading it before watching the movie. I also recommend reading the sequel, the Carousel. The movie unfortunately doesn't have nearly all the details and a few minor changes were made.( For instance in the movie Michael's father is alive and he and Michael become friends, but in the book he dies.)  I thought the director picked the perfect actors for the role.  I cannot imagine someone other than the talented Vanessa Redgrave playing the part of Ester, nor anyone playing the part of sensitive, honest Michael other than the hot Chad Willet.",4,tear jerker,1119744000,"06 26, 2005",2005,1039,"['reading', 'Locket', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'when', 'found', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'movie', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'Michael', 'who', 'death', 'mother', 'job', 'nursing', 'home', 'elderly', 'woman', 'Ester', 'who', 'life', 'better', 'what', 'faith', 'forgivenss', 'are', 'MIchael', 'go', 'many', 'trials', 'young', 'life', 'become', 'better', 'not', 'bitter', 'book', 'definitely', 'better', 'would', 'recommend', 'reading', 'watching', 'movie', 'also', 'recommend', 'reading', 'sequel', 'Carousel', 'movie', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'have', 'nearly', 'details', 'few', 'minor', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'instance', 'movie', 'Michael', 'father', 'alive', 'Michael', 'become', 'friends', 'book', 'thought', 'director', 'picked', 'perfect', 'actors', 'role', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'someone', 'other', 'talented', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'playing', 'part', 'Ester', 'anyone', 'playing', 'part', 'sensitive', 'honest', 'Michael', 'other', 'hot', 'Chad', 'Willet']",N/A

I think Vanessa Redgrave- who is always phenomenal- as Esther Huish was a good casting choice. The best parts in the movie are scenes with her and Chad Willet and how she teaches him about love, forgiveness, and never giving up hope. Some of the scenes are a little corny but the movie really speaks volumes about life's important things. It is interesting to see how Chad Willet's character Michael evolves through the movie into someone who can love and be loved and isn't burdened by resentment. Also, I really liked how Ester and Michael's friendship evolves- it doesn't happen all at once which I think is realistic.
