995033,A3RUG7P3B31L3V,B000FS9MY2,Amazon Customer,"[1, 3]","First off, this show is excellently written, excellently executed, and fun. If you have a few days (I was recently ill for a couple myself -- which is how I watched this show) then this series is about the right length to keep you entertained through your entire recovery.Where this show stumbles -- and, honestly, this is the ONLY place it stumbles, is in the casting of Alexandra Cabot as the veteran DA. Now before the SVU fans tear out my throat, I would like to volunteer that she does a fine job with what she was given; she's just miscast. For all her virtues, she can not or does not import the gravitas that McCoy lends L&A; or that Elias Koteas (and his odd hair) lends the pilot of this very series.And if you want to get REALLY heady, you could imagine that the female ADAs in the L&A; Franchise are cast to perform the same function as the ENTIRE PRIMARYCAST of this show... so choosing an L&A; franchise ADA was a HUUUUUGE and fairly obvious mistake.So, my final vote is, that without the 'guiding hand' showing these errant young DAs who they want to be (and as viewers we want to see all of them become McCoys, eventually) this show never really found its direction. So, sad to see CONVICTION go, but a directionless show deserves the axe. Still, for everything it does right, this show is extremely watchable and easily deserves its 4 stars.",4,"Well written, engaging, but missing something",1163030400,"11 9, 2006",2006,1358,"['First', 'off', 'show', 'excellently', 'written', 'excellently', 'executed', 'fun', 'have', 'few', 'days', 'was', 'recently', 'ill', 'couple', 'how', 'watched', 'show', 'then', 'series', 'right', 'length', 'keep', 'entertained', 'entire', 'recovery.Where', 'show', 'honestly', 'ONLY', 'place', 'casting', 'Alexandra', 'Cabot', 'veteran', 'DA', 'Now', 'SVU', 'fans', 'tear', 'out', 'throat', 'would', 'like', 'volunteer', 'fine', 'job', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'just', 'miscast', 'virtues', 'can', 'not', 'not', 'import', 'gravitas', 'McCoy', 'L', 'A', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'odd', 'hair', 'pilot', 'very', 'series.And', 'want', 'get', 'REALLY', 'heady', 'could', 'imagine', 'female', 'ADAs', 'L', 'A', 'Franchise', 'are', 'cast', 'perform', 'same', 'function', 'ENTIRE', 'PRIMARYCAST', 'show', 'so', 'choosing', 'L', 'A', 'franchise', 'ADA', 'was', 'HUUUUUGE', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'mistake.So', 'final', 'vote', ""'guiding"", 'hand', 'showing', 'errant', 'young', 'DAs', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'viewers', 'want', 'see', 'become', 'McCoys', 'eventually', 'show', 'never', 'really', 'found', 'direction', 'So', 'sad', 'see', 'CONVICTION', 'go', 'directionless', 'show', 'axe', 'Still', 'everything', 'right', 'show', 'extremely', 'watchable', 'easily', '4', 'stars']",Conviction: The Complete Series

995036,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000FS9MY2,calvinnme,"[2, 5]","I always liked this show, but then I had read up on it beforehand and knew that it was not going to be another Law & Order type show. I knew was written for a younger audience than the traditional viewers of the L&O; franchise, and that it would be featuring more of the personal lives of the young attorneys. I felt it was a little confused at first, but that it had found its moorings by the close of the season and I was disappointed that it was not renewed for a second season. It had potential. Its two downfalls were, first off, that people who tuned in were probably expecting a Law & Order type show, and when they didn't get it, didn't continue to tune in. Secondly, it also had a deadly timeslot - Saturday night - when many of its target demographic are not watching TV.  If you liked the organization of ""The Practice"", you'd probably enjoy this series. Nobody else listed the episodes, so I do that next:Pilot - Nick Potter leaves his law firm to join the New York District Attorney's office which is currently investigating a known drug dealer. Meanwhile, Finn loses key evidence for her case. Soon an assistant D.A. is gunned down and it turns out that another A.D.A. might be involved.Denial - Steele has to prosecute a 14 year old boy as an adult after he killed his brother with a baseball bat. Peluso must investigate why a high school athlete commited a hate crime. Rossi tries to get a prostitute to testify at a sexual assault trial and Finn gets ready for her blind date.Breakup - Finn has to investigate why a mother said her daughter was dying of cancer because the autopsy done after she supposedly commited suicide proves otherwise. Potter's friend is arrested for cocaine possession, but when his friend comes to him for help, Potter sends him to Desmond. Meanwhile, Cabot begins an anti-drug campaign.Indebted - Desmond has to prosecute a well-known rap producer who has been charged with murder. Nick Potter goes on a ride along with two ghetto cops, landing Potter in a meeting with Internal Affairs; Jessica Rossi prosecutes a wife beater, while wrestling with the same problem at home, when her mother tells her she's leaving her father for being abusive, and Christina Finn gets caught up in a case with a spoiled diplomat's son and a strip club.Savasanna -  Finn has to deal with a shaken baby case. Even though his boss wants him to settle a case, Potter says no, but wins anyway. Desmond has a one night stand with a woman from the courthouse. Steele ends up canceling a date with Rossi, but then gets intimate with Cabot moments before she makes a big announcement.Madness - Desmond spends time working in a psychiatric ward. Peluso is pressured by his newly reunited girlfriend. Finn is loaned out to a cruel prosecutor. Potter fills in for Desmond on a bail reduction case with terrible results. Rossi deals with a family battle concerning a deaf girl's boyfriend stabbing her father.True Love - Potter ends up being beaten at gunpoint after trying to get a witness to testify. Rossi's case involves a model who says she was assaulted by a well-known professional. Finn meets a hot, young doctor when he becomes her star witness for her latest case.Downhill - Potter lands an easy case - until a priest wants the charges dropped. Cabot takes the defendant in a case Rossi is prosecuting for an insurance fraud case. Desmond's decision to work with an exclusive men's club comes with a price. Finn deals with a landlord/tenant lawsuit.The Wall - Desmond and Steele have a tough time prosecuting a case in which a teen died while playing the ""choking game"". Peluso faces the blue wall when he tries to prosecute a cop killer. Cabot sends Finn and Potter to acting class in the hopes it will improve their appearances in court. Meanwhile, Rossi tries to deal with her very dysfunctional family.Deliverance - Steele has to go head-to-head with a respected female attorney who defends herself after she is accused of killing her husband.Indiscretion - The victim's father stands in the way of Steele prosecuting a case. Potter ends up bungling an easy drug case he took from Rossi. Desmond's case involves an Upper West Side couple and a fortune teller. Finn and Peluso have what they call an ""almost"" date.180.80 (Finale Part 1) -  A young woman is discovered murdered shortly after she was seen leaving a local bar. Soon, the bar's bouncer is accused of her death.Hostage (Finale Part 2) - The two murder suspects violently take control over the courthouse and end up taking several members of the DA's office hostage while trying to negotiate their escape with the police.",4,Another good series that was not given enough time,1167609600,"01 1, 2007",2007,4610,"['always', 'liked', 'show', 'then', 'had', 'read', 'up', 'beforehand', 'knew', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'Law', 'Order', 'type', 'show', 'knew', 'was', 'written', 'younger', 'audience', 'traditional', 'viewers', 'L', 'O', 'franchise', 'would', 'be', 'featuring', 'more', 'personal', 'lives', 'young', 'attorneys', 'felt', 'was', 'little', 'confused', 'first', 'had', 'found', 'moorings', 'close', 'season', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', 'not', 'renewed', 'second', 'season', 'had', 'potential', 'two', 'downfalls', 'were', 'first', 'people', 'who', 'tuned', 'were', 'probably', 'expecting', 'Law', 'Order', 'type', 'show', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'did', ""n't"", 'continue', 'tune', 'Secondly', 'also', 'had', 'deadly', 'timeslot', 'Saturday', 'night', 'when', 'many', 'target', 'demographic', 'are', 'not', 'watching', 'TV', 'liked', 'organization', 'Practice', ""'d"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'series', 'Nobody', 'else', 'listed', 'episodes', 'do', 'next', 'Pilot', 'Nick', 'Potter', 'law', 'firm', 'join', 'New', 'York', 'District', 'Attorney', 'office', 'currently', 'investigating', 'known', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Meanwhile', 'Finn', 'key', 'evidence', 'case', 'Soon', 'assistant', 'D.A', 'gunned', 'down', 'out', 'A.D.A', 'might', 'be', 'involved.Denial', 'Steele', 'prosecute', '14', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'adult', 'killed', 'brother', 'baseball', 'bat', 'Peluso', 'must', 'investigate', 'why', 'high', 'school', 'athlete', 'commited', 'hate', 'crime', 'Rossi', 'get', 'prostitute', 'testify', 'sexual', 'assault', 'trial', 'Finn', 'ready', 'blind', 'date.Breakup', 'Finn', 'investigate', 'why', 'mother', 'said', 'daughter', 'was', 'dying', 'cancer', 'autopsy', 'done', 'supposedly', 'commited', 'suicide', 'proves', 'otherwise', 'Potter', 'friend', 'arrested', 'cocaine', 'possession', 'when', 'friend', 'help', 'Potter', 'Desmond', 'Meanwhile', 'Cabot', 'anti-drug', 'campaign.Indebted', 'Desmond', 'prosecute', 'well-known', 'rap', 'producer', 'who', 'been', 'charged', 'murder', 'Nick', 'Potter', 'ride', 'two', 'ghetto', 'cops', 'landing', 'Potter', 'meeting', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'Jessica', 'Rossi', 'wife', 'beater', 'wrestling', 'same', 'problem', 'home', 'when', 'mother', 'leaving', 'father', 'being', 'abusive', 'Christina', 'Finn', 'caught', 'up', 'case', 'spoiled', 'diplomat', 'son', 'strip', 'club.Savasanna', 'Finn', 'deal', 'shaken', 'baby', 'case', 'Even', 'boss', 'settle', 'case', 'Potter', 'anyway', 'Desmond', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'woman', 'courthouse', 'Steele', 'up', 'canceling', 'date', 'Rossi', 'then', 'intimate', 'Cabot', 'moments', 'big', 'announcement.Madness', 'Desmond', 'time', 'working', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'Peluso', 'pressured', 'newly', 'reunited', 'girlfriend', 'Finn', 'loaned', 'out', 'cruel', 'prosecutor', 'Potter', 'Desmond', 'bail', 'reduction', 'case', 'terrible', 'results', 'Rossi', 'deals', 'family', 'battle', 'concerning', 'deaf', 'girl', 'boyfriend', 'stabbing', 'father.True', 'Love', 'Potter', 'up', 'being', 'beaten', 'gunpoint', 'trying', 'get', 'witness', 'testify', 'Rossi', 'case', 'model', 'who', 'was', 'assaulted', 'well-known', 'professional', 'Finn', 'hot', 'young', 'doctor', 'when', 'star', 'witness', 'latest', 'case.Downhill', 'Potter', 'easy', 'case', 'priest', 'charges', 'dropped', 'Cabot', 'defendant', 'case', 'Rossi', 'prosecuting', 'insurance', 'fraud', 'case', 'Desmond', 'decision', 'work', 'exclusive', 'men', 'club', 'price', 'Finn', 'deals', 'landlord/tenant', 'lawsuit.The', 'Wall', 'Desmond', 'Steele', 'have', 'tough', 'time', 'prosecuting', 'case', 'teen', 'died', 'playing', 'choking', 'game', 'Peluso', 'blue', 'wall', 'when', 'prosecute', 'cop', 'killer', 'Cabot', 'Finn', 'Potter', 'acting', 'class', 'hopes', 'will', 'improve', 'appearances', 'court', 'Meanwhile', 'Rossi', 'deal', 'very', 'dysfunctional', 'family.Deliverance', 'Steele', 'go', 'head-to-head', 'respected', 'female', 'attorney', 'who', 'herself', 'accused', 'killing', 'husband.Indiscretion', 'victim', 'father', 'way', 'Steele', 'prosecuting', 'case', 'Potter', 'up', 'bungling', 'easy', 'drug', 'case', 'took', 'Rossi', 'Desmond', 'case', 'Upper', 'West', 'Side', 'couple', 'fortune', 'teller', 'Finn', 'Peluso', 'have', 'what', 'call', 'almost', 'date.180.80', 'Finale', 'Part', '1', 'young', 'woman', 'discovered', 'murdered', 'shortly', 'was', 'seen', 'leaving', 'local', 'bar', 'Soon', 'bar', 'bouncer', 'accused', 'death.Hostage', 'Finale', 'Part', '2', 'two', 'murder', 'violently', 'take', 'control', 'courthouse', 'end', 'up', 'taking', 'several', 'members', 'DA', 'office', 'hostage', 'trying', 'negotiate', 'escape', 'police']",Conviction: The Complete Series
995037,AB34G6VKP28L,B000FS9MY2,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[22, 35]","I am an enormous fan of Dick Wolf's other projects. I have spent numerous hours rooting for McCoy, Carmichael, and other characters from the original series, trying to piece together the clues before Bobby Goren and Alexandra Eames, and rooting for the guys of SVU. I even loved the short-lived ""Trial by Jury,"" so when I heard another effort was being made to spin off a show generated toward the younger masses, I was thrilled. The first couple of episodes were decent, but after that they went downhill until a truly spectacular season finale, probably the best work of the season (and maybe filmed that way in the knowledge they had to go out with a bang).The problem was too many characters, and not enough nobility to go around. Contrast these petty, self-serving ""mini"" ADA's with the hard-hitting, moralistic, take-no-prisoners McCoy and you're likely to come up laughing. The plots revolved around too many rape trials, and everything about the attorney's personal lives was uninteresting. Fans of legal dramas want hard-hitting cases that leave you gaping, and that's what Wolf does best. The bed-hopping lawyer soap opera is beneath the man who raised such issues as justification for censorship, murder trials for killed abortion doctors, liberal politicians gone bad, and any one of a thousand other issues raised on the stellar first series. Audiences love Wolf because he pulls out the rug from under us, and gives us something to discuss with our coworkers the next morning. ""Conviction"" didn't do that. It was too obsessed with trying to interest us in the sex lives of its main characters.It was a show with vast potential but only become really good in the last few episodes. By then, it was too late to salvage it from the moral wasteland of primetime.",2,dissapointing from a man of Wolf's hard-hitting reputation,1152748800,"07 13, 2006",2006,1772,"['am', 'enormous', 'fan', 'Dick', 'Wolf', 'other', 'projects', 'have', 'spent', 'numerous', 'hours', 'rooting', 'McCoy', 'Carmichael', 'other', 'characters', 'original', 'series', 'trying', 'piece', 'together', 'clues', 'Bobby', 'Goren', 'Alexandra', 'Eames', 'rooting', 'guys', 'SVU', 'even', 'loved', 'short-lived', 'Trial', 'Jury', 'when', 'heard', 'effort', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'spin', 'off', 'show', 'generated', 'younger', 'masses', 'was', 'thrilled', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'were', 'decent', 'went', 'downhill', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'season', 'finale', 'probably', 'best', 'work', 'season', 'maybe', 'filmed', 'way', 'knowledge', 'had', 'go', 'out', 'bang', '.The', 'problem', 'was', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'not', 'enough', 'nobility', 'go', 'around', 'Contrast', 'petty', 'self-serving', 'mini', 'ADA', 'hard-hitting', 'moralistic', 'take-no-prisoners', 'McCoy', ""'re"", 'likely', 'come', 'up', 'laughing', 'plots', 'revolved', 'around', 'too', 'many', 'rape', 'trials', 'everything', 'attorney', 'personal', 'lives', 'was', 'uninteresting', 'Fans', 'legal', 'dramas', 'want', 'hard-hitting', 'cases', 'leave', 'gaping', 'what', 'Wolf', 'best', 'bed-hopping', 'lawyer', 'soap', 'opera', 'man', 'who', 'raised', 'such', 'issues', 'justification', 'censorship', 'murder', 'trials', 'killed', 'abortion', 'doctors', 'liberal', 'politicians', 'gone', 'bad', 'one', 'thousand', 'other', 'issues', 'raised', 'stellar', 'first', 'series', 'Audiences', 'love', 'Wolf', 'out', 'rug', 'something', 'discuss', 'coworkers', 'next', 'morning', 'Conviction', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'was', 'too', 'obsessed', 'trying', 'interest', 'sex', 'main', 'characters.It', 'was', 'show', 'vast', 'potential', 'only', 'become', 'really', 'good', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'then', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'salvage', 'moral', 'wasteland', 'primetime']",Conviction: The Complete Series

All three seemed devoid of personalities and it was difficult to relate to them.  I did like Finn, Billy, and the guy played by Eric Balfour.The stories weren't original at all, and it did have a soap feel to it.  It was a watchable attempt though.

Hinton ""avid reader""","[32, 34]","I was a huge fan of District Attorney Alexandra Cabot on Law and Order: SVU, so I was thrilled when they brought her back as the bureau chief of a bunch of young district attorneys on Conviction.  This show was marketed for different generation than the other Law and Orders, more specifically a younger demographic.  These ADAs are in their late twenties, and know that there is little glory to be had with the cases that they're getting, but that they're fighting for something real.  Their cases don't have the glitz and glamour of regular Law and Order, and there isn't always a sexual element like on SVU, but their determination and perseverance are a joy to watch.Cabots group of young ADAs is comprised of:Jim Steele: Steele is the Deputy Bureau Chief who has to take over when the other DBC is gunned down in the first episode. Steele is like his name, he is a man made of steel who tries to shape the younger attorneys looking up to him without becoming disillusioned himself. He's also in a relationship with one of them while secretly pining away for Cabot.Nick Potter: Potter is the newest kid to join the bureau and is still wet behind the ears when it comes to criminal law.  The other attorneys love to remind him of this and treat him like a rookie.  Still he's determined to prove himself in their eyes and in Steele's after making a horrible mistake in the first episode.Billy Desmond: Desmond is arrogant, cocky, and full of himself--but with good reason.  He's undefeated in the courtroom (28-0) and he is determined to stay that way. He only takes cases that he can win and will even go as far to hand off a losing case to one of the other lawyers.Christina Finn: Finn has been with bureau for two years and is still a little green in the courtroom.  She gets her first case in the first episode and makes mistakes, but in an endearing way. Finn's like your little sister, you want to look after her because she keeps making the most charming mistakes. Her search for Mr. Right is one of the more lighthearted plot lines in the series.Brian Peluso: Peluso is a smooth talker who spends as much time ducking the ladies who call him at the office as he does working on his cases. He has a mild flirtation with Finn, as well as a gambling problem that continues to rear its ugly head. Still he's Steele's right hand man and a great attorney.Jessica Rossi: Rossi is a tough young attorney who has a weak spot for domestic abuse cases.  She refuses to not prosecute wife beaters, even to her own detriment. Her relationship with Steele is a constant problem throughout the season.I was so disappointed that this show got cancelled because it was really well written and a nice change from the others in the Dick Wolf series. I feel like the original Law and Order has gotten stale in recent years and it might be time to let it go. While SVU is still as great as ever, this was NBC's chance to add a little zest back into a floundering series.  I highly recommend this show to people who enjoyed the original Law and Order back in the Angie Harmon years, and to those who like SVU.  It's great to have Cabot back in the courtroom even if it is only on DVD.",4,NBC's chance to add a little zest to a floundering series,1157155200,"09 2, 2006",2006,3173,"['was', 'huge', 'fan', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Alexandra', 'Cabot', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'was', 'thrilled', 'when', 'brought', 'back', 'bureau', 'chief', 'bunch', 'young', 'district', 'attorneys', 'Conviction', 'show', 'was', 'marketed', 'different', 'generation', 'other', 'Law', 'Orders', 'more', 'specifically', 'younger', 'demographic', 'ADAs', 'are', 'late', 'twenties', 'know', 'little', 'glory', 'be', 'had', 'cases', ""'re"", 'getting', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'something', 'real', 'cases', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'glitz', 'glamour', 'regular', 'Law', 'Order', ""n't"", 'always', 'sexual', 'element', 'SVU', 'determination', 'perseverance', 'are', 'joy', 'watch.Cabots', 'group', 'young', 'ADAs', 'comprised', 'Jim', 'Steele', 'Steele', 'Deputy', 'Bureau', 'Chief', 'who', 'take', 'over', 'when', 'other', 'DBC', 'gunned', 'down', 'first', 'episode', 'Steele', 'name', 'man', 'made', 'steel', 'who', 'shape', 'younger', 'attorneys', 'looking', 'up', 'becoming', 'disillusioned', 'also', 'relationship', 'one', 'secretly', 'pining', 'away', 'Cabot.Nick', 'Potter', 'Potter', 'newest', 'kid', 'join', 'bureau', 'still', 'wet', 'ears', 'when', 'criminal', 'law', 'other', 'attorneys', 'love', 'remind', 'treat', 'rookie', 'Still', 'determined', 'prove', 'eyes', 'Steele', 'making', 'horrible', 'mistake', 'first', 'episode.Billy', 'Desmond', 'Desmond', 'arrogant', 'cocky', 'full', 'good', 'reason', 'undefeated', 'courtroom', '28-0', 'determined', 'stay', 'way', 'only', 'cases', 'can', 'win', 'will', 'even', 'go', 'far', 'hand', 'off', 'losing', 'case', 'one', 'other', 'lawyers.Christina', 'Finn', 'Finn', 'been', 'bureau', 'two', 'years', 'still', 'little', 'green', 'courtroom', 'first', 'case', 'first', 'episode', 'mistakes', 'endearing', 'way', 'Finn', 'little', 'sister', 'want', 'look', 'making', 'most', 'charming', 'mistakes', 'search', 'Mr', 'Right', 'one', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'plot', 'lines', 'series.Brian', 'Peluso', 'Peluso', 'smooth', 'talker', 'who', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'ducking', 'ladies', 'who', 'call', 'office', 'working', 'cases', 'mild', 'flirtation', 'Finn', 'as', 'well', 'gambling', 'problem', 'rear', 'ugly', 'head', 'Still', 'Steele', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'great', 'attorney.Jessica', 'Rossi', 'Rossi', 'tough', 'young', 'attorney', 'who', 'weak', 'spot', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'cases', 'not', 'prosecute', 'wife', 'beaters', 'even', 'own', 'detriment', 'relationship', 'Steele', 'constant', 'problem', 'season.I', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'show', 'got', 'cancelled', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'written', 'nice', 'change', 'others', 'Dick', 'Wolf', 'series', 'feel', 'original', 'Law', 'Order', 'gotten', 'stale', 'recent', 'years', 'might', 'be', 'time', 'let', 'go', 'SVU', 'still', 'as', 'great', 'ever', 'was', 'NBC', 'chance', 'add', 'little', 'zest', 'back', 'floundering', 'series', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'people', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'Law', 'Order', 'back', 'Angie', 'Harmon', 'years', 'who', 'like', 'SVU', 'great', 'have', 'Cabot', 'back', 'courtroom', 'even', 'only', 'DVD']",Conviction: The Complete Series

995048,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B000FS9MY2,Michael Butts,"[2, 4]","CONVICTION is one of executive producer Dick Wolf's (LAW AND ORDER FRANCHISES) few failures and it's a shame NBC didn't give the series another season.  The show did start off a little weak; CONVICTION is a little more soap opera-ish than the L&O; series, and the series didn't have an intensity associated with those shows.  However, as the series seemed to find its groove and we got to know the characters a little better, the storylines became more interesting and more focus was placed on the crimes rather than the sex antics.  Stephanie March who was on the SVU segments of L&O; for a while brings her character of Alexandra Cabot to this show, and now she's more like the bureaucrats she used to despise--she's not as likeable in this new persona.  Handsome Anson Mount does a good job with his Jim Steele character, but Steele comes across as an arrogant and insensitive lout most of the time--maybe smoothing out his edges could have made the series more tenable; Milena Govich is strong as Rossi, who is having a secret fling with Mount; she brings a lot of ferocious pride to her performance; Jordan Bridges (Beau's son) does well as the sometime naive Nick Potter, who has his own crisis when he is mugged; J. August Richard is the upstanding African American who has never lost a case; Eric Balfour (24) brings a raw sensuality to his lothario womanizing Brian Poliso; and Julianne Nicholson takes top honors for her portrayal of plain jane, dedicated Christine Finney.I wish NBC would have held on for at least one more season, as it is you get a potentially great series that didn't get a chance to achieve a higher status.",4,CRY WOLF,1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,1639,"['CONVICTION', 'one', 'executive', 'producer', 'Dick', 'Wolf', 'LAW', 'ORDER', 'FRANCHISES', 'few', 'failures', 'shame', 'NBC', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'series', 'season', 'show', 'did', 'start', 'off', 'little', 'weak', 'CONVICTION', 'little', 'more', 'soap', 'opera-ish', 'L', 'O', 'series', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'intensity', 'associated', 'shows', 'However', 'series', 'seemed', 'find', 'groove', 'got', 'know', 'characters', 'little', 'better', 'storylines', 'became', 'more', 'interesting', 'more', 'focus', 'was', 'placed', 'crimes', 'rather', 'sex', 'antics', 'Stephanie', 'March', 'who', 'was', 'SVU', 'segments', 'L', 'O', 'while', 'character', 'Alexandra', 'Cabot', 'show', 'now', 'more', 'bureaucrats', 'used', 'despise', 'not', 'likeable', 'new', 'persona', 'Handsome', 'Anson', 'Mount', 'good', 'job', 'Jim', 'Steele', 'character', 'Steele', 'across', 'arrogant', 'insensitive', 'lout', 'most', 'time', 'maybe', 'smoothing', 'out', 'edges', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'series', 'more', 'tenable', 'Milena', 'Govich', 'strong', 'Rossi', 'who', 'having', 'secret', 'fling', 'Mount', 'lot', 'ferocious', 'pride', 'performance', 'Jordan', 'Bridges', 'Beau', 'son', 'well', 'sometime', 'naive', 'Nick', 'Potter', 'who', 'own', 'crisis', 'when', 'mugged', 'J.', 'August', 'Richard', 'upstanding', 'African', 'American', 'who', 'never', 'lost', 'case', 'Eric', 'Balfour', '24', 'raw', 'sensuality', 'lothario', 'womanizing', 'Brian', 'Poliso', 'Julianne', 'Nicholson', 'top', 'honors', 'portrayal', 'plain', 'jane', 'dedicated', 'Christine', 'Finney.I', 'wish', 'NBC', 'would', 'have', 'held', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'season', 'get', 'potentially', 'great', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'achieve', 'higher', 'status']",Conviction: The Complete Series

I think it was a little slow moving, but there were so many possibilities with this series, for instance crossing over to the SVU in some cases, even the regular Law and Order could have had part 2's as they did with the Practice and Boston Legal, or ER and Third watch. But the ratings I guess were not strong enough. Another really good series ""In Justice"" was also yanked and that series was great right from the start.

For what it's worth, my guess is that the characters - with the exception of Nick Potter (played by Jordan Bridges) and Chris Finn (played by Julianne Nicholson) - were just all so patently difficult to like and/or identify with. Even Alexandra Cabot (played by the brilliant Stephanie March) who was really one to watch when she was on earlier seasons of ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" has now climbed a few steps up the career ladder (she's now Bureau Chief, ""the boss"", as she seems to relish in telling us) and become a ""self-important b***h"" (not my words, but the words of a colleague in one particularly tragic episode of the show) and to be honest, 13 episodes was about as much as I could stand. If they had gone on to make season two, I doubt I would have watched it.Another huge personal disappointment with this DVD was with the music. The show had some really good music that would come on towards the end of each episode and I was really hoping the DVD would have details of the people whose music was used. I know they used stuff by popular musicians because I heard Coldplay, James Blunt and Amos Lee among a few others that escape me at the minute. I also know that there's a way the producers are able to use people's music and not credit them at the end of the show; ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" did it too but at least they gave us details in the DVD extras. It's a glaring omission in my book.That said, in all other respects this is a brilliant legal drama as one would expect from Dick Wolf and it's this that redeems the DVD set. It's what makes it worth buying if you didn't see it when it originally aired. The cases and characters are realistic and the show is well written, well acted and directed. The season finale starring Gbenga Akinnagbe, an actor whose work I'm really enjoying on HBO's ""The Wire"" at the moment, was a classic hour of high tension. I remember watching it though and, apart from one or two exceptions, not really caring which way things went. That's when it dawned on me why I didn't like the show as much as I could have. I just wish they had bestowed a bit more humanity on the main characters. I didn't know prosecuting lawyers could be so cold, arrogant, unfeeling, miserable and acutely self-obsessed - and I've been watching all manner of legal drama for over 20 years now.So in short: Very enjoyable drama; shame about the main characters in it.",4,Great show; shame about the main characters,1199491200,"01 5, 2008",2008,2544,"['Watching', '13', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'quite', 'easy', 'come', 'up', 'theory', 'why', 'show', 'never', 'made', 'first', 'season', 'what', 'worth', 'guess', 'characters', 'exception', 'Nick', 'Potter', 'played', 'Jordan', 'Bridges', 'Chris', 'Finn', 'played', 'Julianne', 'Nicholson', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'patently', 'difficult', 'like', 'and/or', 'identify', 'Even', 'Alexandra', 'Cabot', 'played', 'brilliant', 'Stephanie', 'March', 'who', 'was', 'really', 'one', 'watch', 'when', 'was', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Law', 'Order', 'Special', 'Victims', 'Unit', 'now', 'climbed', 'few', 'steps', 'career', 'ladder', 'now', 'Bureau', 'Chief', 'boss', 'relish', 'telling', 'become', 'self-important', 'b***h', 'not', 'words', 'words', 'colleague', 'one', 'particularly', 'tragic', 'episode', 'show', 'be', 'honest', '13', 'episodes', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'stand', 'had', 'gone', 'make', 'season', 'two', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'it.Another', 'huge', 'personal', 'disappointment', 'DVD', 'was', 'music', 'show', 'had', 'really', 'good', 'music', 'would', 'come', 'towards', 'end', 'episode', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'details', 'people', 'music', 'was', 'used', 'know', 'used', 'stuff', 'popular', 'musicians', 'heard', 'Coldplay', 'James', 'Blunt', 'Amos', 'Lee', 'few', 'others', 'escape', 'minute', 'also', 'know', 'way', 'producers', 'are', 'able', 'use', 'people', 'music', 'not', 'credit', 'end', 'show', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Street', 'did', 'too', 'least', 'gave', 'details', 'DVD', 'extras', 'glaring', 'omission', 'book.That', 'said', 'other', 'respects', 'brilliant', 'legal', 'drama', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Dick', 'Wolf', 'DVD', 'set', 'what', 'worth', 'buying', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'cases', 'characters', 'are', 'realistic', 'show', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'directed', 'season', 'finale', 'starring', 'Gbenga', 'Akinnagbe', 'actor', 'work', ""'m"", 'really', 'enjoying', 'HBO', 'Wire', 'moment', 'was', 'classic', 'hour', 'high', 'tension', 'remember', 'watching', 'apart', 'one', 'two', 'exceptions', 'not', 'really', 'caring', 'way', 'things', 'went', 'when', 'dawned', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'bestowed', 'bit', 'more', 'humanity', 'main', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'prosecuting', 'lawyers', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'cold', 'arrogant', 'unfeeling', 'miserable', 'acutely', 'self-obsessed', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'manner', 'legal', 'drama', '20', 'years', 'now.So', 'short', 'Very', 'enjoyable', 'drama', 'main', 'characters']",Conviction: The Complete Series

995055,A3FDO58UAHVQD1,B000FS9MY2,Servo,"[14, 16]","The first Law & Order series to not be called Law & Order, ""Conviction"" was NBC's very obvious answer to ABC's hit seriesGrey's Anatomyonly with lawyers instead of doctors. Despite their own hopes that Conviction could do for law dramas what Grey's Anatomy had done for medical dramas, NBC (as with creator Dick Wolf's previously short-livedLaw & Order: Trial By Jury) ultimately cancelled the series. Too bad, especially for fans of Stephanie March'sLaw & Order: Special Victims Unitcharacter ADA Alex Cabot, as later episodes, according to March, would have dealt in depth with Alex, both in terms of her family and what makes her tick. Thankfully though, the producers were allowed to wrap up the series with a satisfying two-part finale. Conviction might've deviated somewhat from the typical L & O formula, but it still remained true in tone to the other Law & Order shows. Definitely a worthy addition to any Court TV DVD collection. Not so much for the packaging and extras which are solid, but for the episodes themselves which feature immaculate picture and sound. Not to mention the show's killer theme song ""Destiny"" bySyntaxwhich can now be heard in both the main and closing titles. Props to Universal for a great transfer.
