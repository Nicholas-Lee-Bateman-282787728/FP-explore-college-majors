THE GREAT WHITE HOPE is the story of Jack Johnson, the famed illustrious 'Negro' boxer.  Fortunately, James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander reprieve the role they played in the successful Broadway play (1968), each giving a powerful performance.  It was said that Mohamed Ali saw the play and later modeled his boxing 'personality' after the famed Jack Johnson.I've read many biographies of the late Jack Johnson, and I think that the movie does not follow true to the actually events in Johnson's life.  Still, the movie is gripping, thanks to James Earl Jones' intense electrifying portrayal of Jack Johnson.

263225,A1S3IEVZI29T7H,6301720385,"Raider Jack ""Jackie D Gray-Romeyn""","[5, 5]","As an 18-yr old, I vividly remember when this movie came out and the swirling controversies that accompanied it. Whites were cautious because it openly dealt with not only an interracial love affair but because of the depiction of an unrelenting, proud, and VERY angry black man. Interestingly enough, with the advent of Black Power/the Revolution and the emergence of the Black Panthers, most black audiences were equally cautious as well and for exactly the same reasons. Also keep in mind I was living in the South then too. Even in 1970, few southern towns would actually show the film.This is a variation on the real-life troubles of Jack Johnson, one of boxing's earliest contenders.Hands down the most compelling performances are those of James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander that leave an indelible imprint on the viewer. Because of the racial fabric of the time, Jack knew he was asking for trouble by openly defying white authority and then compounding that by becoming involved with a white woman. Both undoubtedly knew full well what they would be up against. While they may have deeply loved each other in the beginning, they soon discovered that simply love does not conquer all.The movie is also filled with treasures of African-American performances by the likes of Beah Richards, Moses Gunn, Roy Glenn Sr. and Virginia Capers. This alone is worth the price of admission.In many instances it is most difficult to watch. Two mesmerizing and thoroughly wrenching scenes were Jane's suicide and when Jack and company were reduced to performing ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" in Europe to survive.The film is most certainly uncompromising which was a MAJOR achievement given the social fabric at the time. James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander both deserved Oscars for their performances but that would have been like condoning their whole situation and god KNOWS Hollywood would NEVER have done that.....(sigh) Another example of not being able to see the forest for the trees.Nonetheless, this is an eeeeeeeeeexcellent film and most worthy of your movie collection",5,"Powerful, Compelling, and still QUITE relevant",1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,2064,"['18-yr', 'old', 'vividly', 'remember', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'swirling', 'controversies', 'accompanied', 'Whites', 'were', 'cautious', 'openly', 'not', 'only', 'interracial', 'love', 'affair', 'depiction', 'unrelenting', 'proud', 'VERY', 'angry', 'black', 'man', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'advent', 'Black', 'Power/the', 'Revolution', 'emergence', 'Black', 'Panthers', 'most', 'black', 'audiences', 'were', 'equally', 'cautious', 'well', 'exactly', 'same', 'reasons', 'Also', 'keep', 'mind', 'was', 'living', 'South', 'then', 'too', 'Even', '1970', 'few', 'southern', 'towns', 'would', 'actually', 'show', 'film.This', 'variation', 'real-life', 'troubles', 'Jack', 'Johnson', 'one', 'boxing', 'earliest', 'down', 'most', 'compelling', 'performances', 'are', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'leave', 'indelible', 'imprint', 'viewer', 'racial', 'fabric', 'time', 'Jack', 'knew', 'was', 'asking', 'trouble', 'openly', 'defying', 'white', 'authority', 'then', 'compounding', 'becoming', 'involved', 'white', 'woman', 'undoubtedly', 'knew', 'full', 'well', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'up', 'may', 'have', 'deeply', 'loved', 'other', 'beginning', 'soon', 'discovered', 'simply', 'love', 'not', 'conquer', 'all.The', 'movie', 'also', 'filled', 'treasures', 'African-American', 'performances', 'likes', 'Beah', 'Richards', 'Moses', 'Gunn', 'Roy', 'Glenn', 'Sr.', 'Virginia', 'Capers', 'alone', 'price', 'admission.In', 'many', 'instances', 'most', 'difficult', 'watch', 'Two', 'mesmerizing', 'thoroughly', 'wrenching', 'scenes', 'were', 'Jane', 'suicide', 'when', 'Jack', 'company', 'were', 'reduced', 'performing', 'Uncle', 'Tom', 'Cabin', 'Europe', 'survive.The', 'film', 'most', 'certainly', 'uncompromising', 'was', 'MAJOR', 'achievement', 'given', 'social', 'fabric', 'time', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'deserved', 'Oscars', 'performances', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'condoning', 'whole', 'situation', 'god', 'KNOWS', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'NEVER', 'have', 'done', '..', 'sigh', 'example', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'forest', 'trees.Nonetheless', 'eeeeeeeeeexcellent', 'film', 'most', 'worthy', 'movie', 'collection']",Great White Hope VHS

Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[0, 0]","This is a fictionalized account of the first black heavyweight boxing champion, Jack Johnson, adapted from a stageplay of the same name. It is great cinema and James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander, reprising their roles from the stageplay, deliver tour de force, Oscar-worthy performances. This was Jones' break out movie role and the movie debut for Alexander. Jones' characterization of Jack Jefferson is consistent with the historical cocky, flamboyant, Jack Johnson, who spurned the Jim Crow boundaries of his era by driving fast cars, wearing expensive clothing and consorting with fast women, including numerous affairs w/white women. He married three white women...Jane Alexander's Eleanor Bachman is probably meant to be a composite; but is more consistent with Etta Terry Duryea, a Brooklyn socialite and former wife of businessman Charles Duryea, than with the other two. Their romantic involvement and marriage was very turbulent; and she did commit suicide by shooting herself with a revolver, not by jumping into a well. While this movie is an excellent fictional dramatization and highly recommended, if you want the real story, watch Jim Burns' &#34;Unforgivable Blackness&#34;.

When things get too hot, he leaves the US and goes overseas, doing things he don't care for and trying to keep some respectability with himself.
