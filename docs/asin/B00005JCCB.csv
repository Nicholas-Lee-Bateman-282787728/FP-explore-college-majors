582892,AOOCDN5TFZ9QP,B00005JCCB,"Amazon Customer ""benshlomo""","[1, 3]","Here we have a classic example of the good-natured movie that fails the Gene Siskel test - it's less interesting than a documentary of the actors having lunch and discussing the script would be.It's Monica Potter's first attempt at comedy (unless, unlike me, you consider &quot;Patch Adams&quot; a comedy), and she does a serviceable job, word-mangling and pratfalling like a real trouper. She plays Amanda, a painting restorer at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, who lucks into an enormous Westside apartment for $500 per month. This is the first of several elements in which it is impossible to believe, but it's pretty standard stuff next to the reason given for the low rent. See, the apartment belongs to a modeling agency that lets four girls stay in it for free, and they decide to rent out a closet as a bedroom to get some extra cash. Now, I ask you; if you were a New York high fashion model, could you get by on $500 per month in spending money? Divided four ways?Be that as it may, Amanda, who proudly announces to the women in the audience &quot;I know you think you have the world's worst taste in men, but you don't, I do,&quot; falls for the fashion executive across the street, after a classic Meet Cute featuring an amorous Great Dane named Hamlet. Get it? In case you don't, Amanda explains it for you.The fashion exec is Jim, played by Freddie Prinze Jr. with all the personality of a loaf of white bread. Well, okay, not a loaf of white bread; we get plenty of chances to observe his muscle tone as the girls ogle him through his conveniently uncurtained windows, which are apparently opaque from the inside since he never notices that he's being spied on from fifty feet away. We don't get a chance to see his acting ability, since he's playing Cary Grant Lite.Then Amanda sees him bash an attractive blonde's head in with a baseball bat. The cops won't listen. Amanda enlists her supermodel roommates to conduct their own investigation before her Saturday date with this presumed psycho killer. So the supermodels reluctantly endure some of the more grotesque bathroom humor of recent years, the New York subway and a variety of other Manhattan exteriors to spy on Jim. Despite their height, perfect makeup and designer outfits, no one notices them, least of all the man they're following. Hijincks ensue.In short, this is a combination of Rear Window and North by Northwest, with a few uninspired screwball comedy reflexes thrown in. Now, in my book, good performances make up for a lot of sins, and there are several nice ones here. The supermodels hired to play the supermodels in particular acquit themselves well, especially Shalom Harlow as an opportunistic Jewish American Princess and Ivana Milicevic as a cynical Russian, along with Sarah O'Hare as a klutzy Aussie and Tomika Fraser as an intelligent African-American. Indeed, the four of them manage to outshine Potter and Prinze both, and it's a shame they weren't given a movie of their own. Or at least some of the screen time otherwise devoted to the aforementioned bathroom humor, tired romantic-thriller plot, and whining voiceovers. Or that documentary of the four of them having lunch.I'd be interested in a movie about four good-natured models thrashing through the New York fashion world - I'd enjoy looking at them, of course, and I might learn something about fashion, too. I certainly didn't learn much about that from this movie, although the filmmakers apparently did. Their script, design and direction partake of a well-known fashion technique, that of the knockoff. Same design as a classic, in this case Alfred Hitchcock's combination of thriller and comedy elements, only made with much weaker materials.Benshlomo says, Knockoffs are only worthwhile if they're cheaper than the real thing.",2,Too expensive for a cheap copy,998265600,"08 20, 2001",2001,3798,"['Here', 'have', 'classic', 'example', 'good-natured', 'movie', 'Gene', 'Siskel', 'test', 'less', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'actors', 'having', 'lunch', 'discussing', 'script', 'would', 'be.It', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'first', 'attempt', 'comedy', 'consider', 'quot', 'Patch', 'Adams', 'quot', 'comedy', 'serviceable', 'job', 'word-mangling', 'pratfalling', 'real', 'trouper', 'Amanda', 'painting', 'restorer', 'New', 'York', 'Metropolitan', 'Museum', 'Art', 'who', 'enormous', 'Westside', 'apartment', '500', 'month', 'first', 'several', 'elements', 'impossible', 'believe', 'pretty', 'standard', 'stuff', 'reason', 'given', 'low', 'rent', 'See', 'apartment', 'modeling', 'agency', 'four', 'girls', 'stay', 'free', 'decide', 'rent', 'out', 'closet', 'bedroom', 'get', 'extra', 'cash', 'Now', 'ask', 'were', 'New', 'York', 'high', 'fashion', 'model', 'could', 'get', '500', 'month', 'spending', 'money', 'Divided', 'four', 'ways', 'Be', 'may', 'Amanda', 'who', 'proudly', 'women', 'audience', 'quot', 'know', 'think', 'have', 'world', 'worst', 'taste', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'quot', 'fashion', 'executive', 'street', 'classic', 'Meet', 'Cute', 'featuring', 'amorous', 'Great', 'Dane', 'named', 'Hamlet', 'Get', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'Amanda', 'you.The', 'fashion', 'exec', 'Jim', 'played', 'Freddie', 'Prinze', 'Jr.', 'personality', 'loaf', 'white', 'bread', 'Well', 'okay', 'not', 'loaf', 'white', 'bread', 'get', 'plenty', 'chances', 'observe', 'muscle', 'tone', 'girls', 'ogle', 'conveniently', 'uncurtained', 'windows', 'are', 'apparently', 'inside', 'never', 'being', 'spied', 'fifty', 'feet', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'acting', 'ability', 'playing', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Lite.Then', 'Amanda', 'bash', 'attractive', 'blonde', 'head', 'baseball', 'bat', 'cops', 'wo', ""n't"", 'listen', 'Amanda', 'supermodel', 'conduct', 'own', 'investigation', 'Saturday', 'date', 'presumed', 'psycho', 'killer', 'supermodels', 'reluctantly', 'endure', 'more', 'grotesque', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'recent', 'years', 'New', 'York', 'subway', 'variety', 'other', 'Manhattan', 'exteriors', 'spy', 'Jim', 'height', 'perfect', 'makeup', 'designer', 'outfits', 'one', 'least', 'man', ""'re"", 'following', 'Hijincks', 'short', 'combination', 'Rear', 'Window', 'North', 'Northwest', 'few', 'uninspired', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'reflexes', 'thrown', 'Now', 'book', 'good', 'performances', 'make', 'up', 'lot', 'sins', 'are', 'several', 'nice', 'ones', 'here', 'supermodels', 'hired', 'play', 'supermodels', 'particular', 'acquit', 'well', 'especially', 'Shalom', 'Harlow', 'opportunistic', 'Jewish', 'American', 'Princess', 'Ivana', 'Milicevic', 'cynical', 'Russian', 'Sarah', ""O'Hare"", 'klutzy', 'Aussie', 'Tomika', 'Fraser', 'intelligent', 'African-American', 'Indeed', 'four', 'manage', 'outshine', 'Potter', 'Prinze', 'shame', 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'movie', 'own', 'least', 'screen', 'time', 'otherwise', 'devoted', 'aforementioned', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'tired', 'romantic-thriller', 'plot', 'whining', 'voiceovers', 'documentary', 'four', 'having', 'lunch.I', ""'d"", 'be', 'interested', 'movie', 'four', 'good-natured', 'models', 'thrashing', 'New', 'York', 'fashion', 'world', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'looking', 'course', 'might', 'learn', 'something', 'fashion', 'too', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'learn', 'much', 'movie', 'filmmakers', 'apparently', 'did', 'Their', 'script', 'design', 'direction', 'partake', 'well-known', 'fashion', 'technique', 'knockoff', 'Same', 'design', 'classic', 'case', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'combination', 'thriller', 'comedy', 'elements', 'only', 'made', 'much', 'weaker', 'materials.Benshlomo', 'Knockoffs', 'are', 'only', 'worthwhile', ""'re"", 'cheaper', 'real', 'thing']",Head Over Heels

For those who adore the art of chick-flick cliche, this movie is overflowing.  Our heroine, Amanda, has a history of bad taste in men (surprise), and comes home one day to find her boyfriend cheating on her (surprise again).  She moves in with a group of comic-sidekicks, er, models, and meets the man of her dreams while waiting for an elevator (didn't see that one coming, did you?)Up until this point it's pretty normal.  Amanda spies on Jim (the dream guy), and the models are there saying funny things and doing funny things.  Then the movie gets wierd.  Amanda thinks Jim killed a woman, and the already weak plot folds under like a wet noodle.  The last half of this movie is absolutely ridiculous--a new low in comedy-romance.So why two stars?  Well, the models ARE kind of funny sometimes.  Still, Freddy Prinze Jr. is not at all believable in his role as Jim.

It's about Amanda who falls for Jim, who may or may not be a murderer. The whole film is trying to find out if Jim is actually murderer. Monica Potter is charming and cute in the role of Amanda, and givin the right role she could be the next Julia Roberts. Freddie Prinze Jr is also very charming and likeable as Jim, but it's hard for me to believe that Jim is a hot fashion executive. Freddie still looks like he's 18. The movie goes for the laughs by having Amanda be a klutz and it has it's moments, but how many times can you laugh at her falling down the stairs. Freddies character does not fair so well with the laughs. The writers deciede to for crude and disgusting. Do we really want to hear Freddie Prinze Jr going to the bathroom, and being very, very loud about it, if you know what I mean. This has no relevance to the story except just to get a laugh. The 4 models Amanda lives with are very funny and likeable. There is a hysterical scene where the girls get stuck in a resturant bathroom, that leads them to believe Jim is gay. This scene is also very crude and disgusting, but it has a something to do with the plot of the story(kind of).

Waters / 2001 / Universal Video & DVD / 87 minutes / PG-13]Mark S. Waters directed one of my favorite quirky comedies, The House of Yes, a few years ago. This little independent film has been mostly overlooked and may yet be gathering dust in your favorite video store. It contained a dazzling performance by Parker Posey and a most interesting one by Freddie Prinz, Jr. Mr. Prinz also stars in Water's second movie, Head Over Heels, along with Monica Potter. It cost ten times more to make than The House of Yes, but, sadly, it delivers less than half the laughs. Mr. Waters and the attractive cast try hard, but they are working with a script so light and misdirected that they can't help but flounder ay times. The movie isn't all bad. There are several laugh out loud scenes and several good lines which are not enough to overcome a story that is all voer the map.Monica Potter is Amanda, a bubbly girl who works as an art restorer at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Of course, since this is a movie aimed at a teen audience, Amanda's job is not even remotely similar to a real one at that prestigious institution. For example, her boss brings her some very old and famous painting because one of the faces in it is no longer clear. He simply tells her to paint in a new face. Any face, it seems. One day she comes home to find her live-in boyfriend in bed with another woman. For some reason, instead of telling him to pack up and leave, she decides she must move out. On her way to see an apartment, she is knocked down by a Doberman pincher that is being walked by Jim [Freddie Prinz, Jr.], an adorable guy Amanda instantly falls for - literally. She winds up living with four mad-as- hatters fashion models, and, conveniently, their apartment windows have an excellent view into Jim's pad. Amanda and Jim soon get cozy with each other, and all is going well until the night she thinks she sees him murdering a woman. What follows is a series of misunderstandings and sight gags. The gags make sense. The rest doesn't.The movie tries to be too many things. It's a romance, a mystery, and a satire of models and the world of high fashion. It is also partly action-adventure. If one of these elements had been highlighted, the whole thing might have worked. Instead, it bounces back and forth, with weak results.Considering they have little to work with, the cast is good. Freddie Prinz, Jr. is starting to mature, and in this role he vaguely reminds me of a very young Cary Grant or Rock Hudson. He might actually become real leading man material one day. Shalom Harlow, Ivana Milicevic, Sarah O'Hara and Tomiko Fraser play the models, which is easy for them because they actually are models. To me, their scenes are the movie's funniest. Perhaps if Head Over Heels had been a simple comedy about two young people trying to fall in love in the shallow, empty world of fashion, it might have worked. The subplot about Jim's maybe being a murderer never really works, and the shoot outs and car chases seem like they belong in another movie entirely.",2,Romantic comedy is all over the map,1016064000,"03 14, 2002",2002,3195,"['HEAD', 'OVER', 'HEELS', '[', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'Freddie', 'Prinz', 'Jr.', 'Shalom', 'Marlow', 'Ivana', 'Milicevic', 'Sarah', ""O'Hara"", 'Tomiko', 'Fraser', '/', 'Directed', 'Mark', 'S.', 'Waters', '/', '2001', '/', 'Universal', 'Video', 'DVD', '87', 'minutes', '/', 'PG-13', ']', 'Mark', 'S.', 'Waters', 'directed', 'one', 'favorite', 'quirky', 'comedies', 'House', 'Yes', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'little', 'independent', 'film', 'been', 'mostly', 'overlooked', 'may', 'yet', 'be', 'gathering', 'dust', 'favorite', 'video', 'store', 'contained', 'dazzling', 'performance', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'most', 'interesting', 'one', 'Freddie', 'Prinz', 'Jr.', 'Mr.', 'Prinz', 'also', 'Water', 'second', 'movie', 'Head', 'Over', 'Heels', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'cost', 'ten', 'times', 'more', 'make', 'House', 'Yes', 'sadly', 'less', 'laughs', 'Mr', 'Waters', 'attractive', 'cast', 'try', 'hard', 'are', 'working', 'script', 'so', 'light', 'misdirected', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'flounder', 'ay', 'times', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'are', 'several', 'out', 'loud', 'scenes', 'several', 'good', 'lines', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'overcome', 'story', 'map.Monica', 'Potter', 'Amanda', 'bubbly', 'girl', 'who', 'art', 'restorer', 'New', 'York', 'Metropolitan', 'Museum', 'Art', 'course', 'movie', 'aimed', 'teen', 'audience', 'Amanda', 'job', 'not', 'even', 'remotely', 'similar', 'real', 'one', 'prestigious', 'institution', 'example', 'boss', 'very', 'old', 'famous', 'painting', 'one', 'no', 'longer', 'clear', 'simply', 'paint', 'new', 'face', 'face', 'One', 'day', 'home', 'find', 'live-in', 'boyfriend', 'bed', 'woman', 'reason', 'instead', 'telling', 'pack', 'up', 'leave', 'must', 'move', 'out', 'way', 'see', 'apartment', 'knocked', 'down', 'Doberman', 'pincher', 'being', 'walked', 'Jim', '[', 'Freddie', 'Prinz', 'Jr.', ']', 'adorable', 'guy', 'Amanda', 'instantly', 'literally', 'up', 'living', 'four', 'mad-as-', 'hatters', 'fashion', 'models', 'conveniently', 'apartment', 'windows', 'have', 'excellent', 'view', 'Jim', 'pad', 'Amanda', 'Jim', 'soon', 'get', 'cozy', 'other', 'going', 'well', 'night', 'murdering', 'woman', 'What', 'series', 'misunderstandings', 'sight', 'gags', 'gags', 'make', 'sense', 'rest', ""doesn't.The"", 'movie', 'tries', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'romance', 'mystery', 'satire', 'models', 'world', 'high', 'fashion', 'also', 'partly', 'action-adventure', 'one', 'elements', 'had', 'been', 'highlighted', 'whole', 'thing', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'Instead', 'back', 'forth', 'weak', 'results.Considering', 'have', 'little', 'work', 'cast', 'good', 'Freddie', 'Prinz', 'Jr.', 'starting', 'mature', 'role', 'vaguely', 'very', 'young', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'might', 'actually', 'become', 'real', 'leading', 'man', 'material', 'one', 'day', 'Shalom', 'Harlow', 'Ivana', 'Milicevic', 'Sarah', ""O'Hara"", 'Tomiko', 'Fraser', 'play', 'models', 'easy', 'actually', 'are', 'models', 'scenes', 'are', 'movie', 'funniest', 'Perhaps', 'Head', 'Over', 'Heels', 'had', 'been', 'simple', 'comedy', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'trying', 'fall', 'love', 'shallow', 'empty', 'world', 'fashion', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'subplot', 'Jim', 'maybe', 'being', 'murderer', 'never', 'really', 'shoot', 'outs', 'car', 'chases', 'seem', 'belong', 'movie', 'entirely']",Head Over Heels

Clumsy, inarticulate art restorer Amanda Pierce (Monica Potter), recently parted from her cheating boyfriend, moves into a lavish apartment with four aspiring supermodels. She promptly falls (you guessed it) head-over-heels in love with the guy across the way - handsome young fashion executive, Jim Winston (Freddy Prinze, Jr). Things go from bad to appalling when the girls witness a murder in Jim's apartment - and Jim's apparently the killer. What follows is something like ""Rear Window"" meets ""Zoolander"", without being one tenth as good as either. As always, Potter and Prinze are hugely likeable, in a cutesy kind of way, so it's hard not to wish they had better material than this. To wit: toilet humor provides the two biggest laughs.
