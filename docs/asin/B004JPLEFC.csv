I'm a big time Kim Jae Joong fan, so I figured i would like it on that level at a minimum.  Plus, I've been pretty satisfied with all of the film he's been in.  This move quietly drew me into it with the beautiful scenery, an interesting storyline and the actors portrayal of their characters.I've watched it several times already.

The concept was wonderful, about a young man in limbo - between life and death - being the postman who responds to letters written by grieving loved ones left behind in this world. The acting was good, the postman was well-played by Hero Jae-joong, but then I may be a bit prejudice since I love his music. He's a very talented singer, but I'm off subject.

1411586,A209J4NK7GR9S3,B004JPLEFC,Lovely D.M.,"[1, 1]","I don't watch a lot of k-movies, because I find K-dramas much better, in general. However I am glad to have checked out this movie, because it is beautiful. Postman to Heaven has this dreamy, surreal, and fairytale-like quality to it. The H/h have great chemistry (it also doesn't hurt that the H is extremely good looking, and I learned that he's a great singer in real life). Their interactions are tender, memorable, and yet have this subtle emotional intensity. This is a moving fairytale-like romance, between the postman whose job is to deliver mail to heaven, and a human girl who is still deeply hurt over the betrayal and loss of her late lover. As they start to fall in love, the question lingers- can there be a happy ending for them? Can he get a second chance at life? Mixed in with this storyline is a moving human drama about those with unresolved grief, due to the loss of a loved one, learning to move on.This is a heartfelt and beautiful fantasy movie, and I really enjoyed it. However what kept it from being a 5 star movie for me was that it could've easily had more emotional punches in the last third of the movie. In conclusion, this movie is a very good and calmly ethereal romance/drama, with a satisfying ending.ETA: This dvd has very good English subs and picture quality. However its flaw is that it seems that the movie is not presented in its original widescreen format on here, it looks like they tried to make it more widescreen (I don't know how else to explain it) so the picture looks odd/stretched sometimes.",4,Dreamy,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,1544,"['do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'lot', 'k-movies', 'find', 'K-dramas', 'much', 'better', 'general', 'However', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'checked', 'out', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'Postman', 'Heaven', 'dreamy', 'surreal', 'fairytale-like', 'quality', 'H/h', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'also', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'H', 'extremely', 'good', 'looking', 'learned', 'great', 'singer', 'real', 'life', 'interactions', 'are', 'tender', 'memorable', 'yet', 'have', 'subtle', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'moving', 'fairytale-like', 'romance', 'postman', 'job', 'deliver', 'mail', 'heaven', 'human', 'girl', 'who', 'still', 'deeply', 'hurt', 'betrayal', 'loss', 'late', 'lover', 'start', 'fall', 'love', 'question', 'lingers-', 'can', 'there', 'be', 'happy', 'ending', 'Can', 'get', 'second', 'chance', 'life', 'Mixed', 'storyline', 'moving', 'human', 'drama', 'unresolved', 'grief', 'due', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'learning', 'move', 'on.This', 'heartfelt', 'beautiful', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'However', 'what', 'kept', 'being', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'was', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'had', 'more', 'emotional', 'punches', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'calmly', 'ethereal', 'romance/drama', 'satisfying', 'ending.ETA', 'dvd', 'very', 'good', 'English', 'subs', 'picture', 'quality', 'However', 'flaw', 'movie', 'not', 'presented', 'original', 'widescreen', 'format', 'here', 'tried', 'make', 'more', 'widescreen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'else', 'explain', 'picture', 'odd/stretched', 'sometimes']",N/A

After watching the movie and inspecting it here is my review.The packaging was nice and neat and as I unwrapped it I noticed a globe on the back with the number 3 on it. I got worried it was not region 1 or NTSC as described. However not only did it play like a dream on my bluray player but the subtitles were clear and contained no spelling errors or anything like you get when you buy bootleg subbed dvds. I did notice that the picture was displayed widescreen which makes the subs easy to see but on my tv there did seem to be a faint sort of second widescreen bar below that. It wasn't something that couldn't be ignored so all in all I'm happy with my purchase.,5,Wonderful,1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,811,"['First', 'already', 'knew', 'loved', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'elsewhere', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'find', 'Amazon', 'Region', '1', 'format', 'watching', 'movie', 'inspecting', 'here', 'review.The', 'packaging', 'was', 'nice', 'neat', 'unwrapped', 'noticed', 'globe', 'back', 'number', '3', 'got', 'worried', 'was', 'not', 'region', '1', 'NTSC', 'described', 'However', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'play', 'dream', 'bluray', 'player', 'subtitles', 'were', 'clear', 'contained', 'spelling', 'errors', 'anything', 'get', 'when', 'buy', 'bootleg', 'subbed', 'dvds', 'did', 'notice', 'picture', 'was', 'displayed', 'widescreen', 'subs', 'easy', 'see', 'tv', 'there', 'did', 'seem', 'be', 'faint', 'sort', 'second', 'widescreen', 'bar', 'was', ""n't"", 'something', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'ignored', 'so', 'all', ""'m"", 'happy', 'purchase']",N/A
1411588,A29KHUO0B70C0I,B004JPLEFC,"Sun ""Sun""","[18, 18]","Beautifully filmed, fairytale-like story of love and loss. There is a mailbox standing out in an empty field, where people leave messages for their dead loved ones. A young woman leaving a message for her recently deceased (and two-timing) lover confronts a young man removing the letters from the box. He claims to be the ""postman to heaven"". What is he, she wonders? A ghost? An angel? Or just a liar? But when he quotes her own letters back to her, she begins to believe. The postman enlists her help in bringing closure to the living, and in doing so, she begins to get over her own grief. The two begin to grow closer, but there's a catch--it seems that only those with unresolved grief can see the postman. Once they've accepted their loss and moved on, so must he.My original review was based on  viewing this movie online at the Dramafever website. I ended up giving that DVD as a gift, so I don't know if the subs are the same or not. I have subsequently purchased several other titles from PMP Entertainment, however, and have never had a problem with them.
