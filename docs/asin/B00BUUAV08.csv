Guetti,"[3, 4]","I like Mad Men because I lived on the East Coast, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut during that era and many of my friends in college had parents with jobs on Wall Street. My own parents were academics, and so I gazed upon the NY Wall St. scene with amazement. I came to realize how much a person's professional reputation meant to them, and because many of  these parents I observed were women ( even though working women are supposedly not encouraged in Mad Men) I realized that either gender could suffer horribly from the terror of being sniped at, judged, threatened, and made to feel inadequate on the job. The women I knew drank a lot and went in for competitive poker games.  They were very disapproving of &#34;college girls&#34; like me because we didn't dress well enough; they had a particular grouch about pony tails (hair drawn back with a rubber band): the very idea that we were getting along with boys our age without the bother of dressing up all the time disturbed them.  My mother made me write &#34;Thank you notes&#34; (a very 'fifties' obsession) and I actually liked the fact that Mrs. X, my New York hostess, always criticized my thank you notes. I wrote them as a boring chore and she called me on it!  Anyway, life was tough for grownups in those days.  So I feel a lot of sympathy, and even a sneaking sort of admiration, from those poor Wall Street types, usually quite talented people who were wasting their time on junk, escaping via booze, sex, and cigarettes. To them, it seemed unimaginable that this life style would ever be seen as quaint old-fashioned weakness and Bad Habits.

It is painfully clear that the writers are riding the wave of publicity this show gets and letting it sail off into syndication.What originally attracted me to this show is gone. The cutting edge company, the turmoil of the ad business, the competition, the intense character development, the business that made these ordinary people truly ""mad"", all left with season 3. The show would now be more aptly called ""The Adventures Of Don and Rodger - and who cares"". Far to little time is spent on the other cast members (with the exception of Peggy) to make the audience care about any of them. I am surprised the show is able to retain these actors season after season. Although this season seems to have brought significant turnover (Don's ad team).The audience has patiently collected bits and pieces of Don's mysterious past along the way but what he is hiding seems to be moot now and at this point I am not sure I care any more.

They're all basically punching the clock and counting the minutes until it's time to go home.This season is replete with rehashed plot elements, insipid dialogue, aimless and meandering storylines and  wildly improbable plot devices like merging the two rival agencies so that Peggy and Don can once again be in the same office. It's a chaotic mess and virtually unwatchable. They ought to put this whole thing out of its misery and not launch season 7. I imagine it'll be even worse than this one.The creators think they can refresh the show by introducing new characters like Don's neighbors the Rosens. What they fail to realize is that such useless characters take screen time away from the characters that did make Mad Men great. It would have been nice to devote a few minutes following up on Ginsberg's blind date. It would have been nice to spend some time following up on Don and Betty's hook-up at the camp. Many other potentially rewarding story arcs are left dangling or just terminated without any sort of an attempt at a resolution. So what we have is a neverending series of vignettes patched haphazardly together but never merging into a cohesive whole.For 4 or 5 years Mad Men was my favorite show. I couldn't wait for it to come on Sunday night. I would contact Amazon customer service to tell them to hurry up and put it in my library. It was, by far, the best show on television. Nothing else even began to approach its brilliance. Now its dead, but still being kept artificially alive by disinterested and tired actors, writers and producers. I'm certainly not subscribing to season 7. I'll wait for it to come out as a bargain bin Black Friday blu-ray just so I can complete my collection.",1,From the best show to one of the worst,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,2047,"['suppose', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'stay', 'tight', 'credible', 'more', '4', 'seasons', 'Mad', 'Men', 'case', 'seasons', 'are', 'cut', 'half', 'still', 'years', 'go', 'people', 'change', 'get', 'tired', 'get', 'bored', 'lose', 'interest', 'how', ""'d"", 'describe', 'everyone', 'involved', 'show', 'writers', 'actors', 'producers', ""'re"", 'basically', 'punching', 'clock', 'counting', 'minutes', 'time', 'go', 'home.This', 'season', 'replete', 'rehashed', 'plot', 'elements', 'insipid', 'dialogue', 'aimless', 'meandering', 'storylines', 'wildly', 'improbable', 'plot', 'devices', 'merging', 'two', 'rival', 'agencies', 'Peggy', 'Don', 'can', 'once', 'again', 'be', 'same', 'office', 'chaotic', 'mess', 'virtually', 'unwatchable', 'ought', 'put', 'whole', 'thing', 'misery', 'not', 'launch', 'season', '7', 'imagine', ""'ll"", 'be', 'even', 'worse', 'one.The', 'creators', 'think', 'can', 'refresh', 'show', 'introducing', 'new', 'characters', 'Don', 'neighbors', 'Rosens', 'What', 'fail', 'realize', 'such', 'useless', 'characters', 'take', 'screen', 'time', 'away', 'characters', 'did', 'make', 'Mad', 'Men', 'great', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'devote', 'few', 'minutes', 'following', 'up', 'Ginsberg', 'blind', 'date', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'spend', 'time', 'following', 'up', 'Don', 'Betty', 'hook-up', 'camp', 'Many', 'other', 'potentially', 'rewarding', 'story', 'arcs', 'are', 'left', 'dangling', 'just', 'terminated', 'sort', 'attempt', 'resolution', 'So', 'what', 'have', 'neverending', 'series', 'vignettes', 'patched', 'haphazardly', 'together', 'never', 'merging', 'cohesive', 'whole.For', '4', '5', 'years', 'Mad', 'Men', 'was', 'favorite', 'show', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'come', 'Sunday', 'night', 'would', 'contact', 'Amazon', 'customer', 'service', 'tell', 'hurry', 'up', 'put', 'library', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'show', 'television', 'Nothing', 'else', 'even', 'began', 'approach', 'brilliance', 'Now', 'dead', 'still', 'being', 'kept', 'artificially', 'alive', 'disinterested', 'tired', 'actors', 'writers', 'producers', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'not', 'subscribing', 'season', '7', ""'ll"", 'wait', 'come', 'out', 'bargain', 'bin', 'Black', 'Friday', 'blu-ray', 'just', 'can', 'complete', 'collection']",N/A

 to me the answer is obvious.  he is the probably the most alone man one could ever encounter. and this time period leads into an era of alienation for the american population unlike any it had known before. parents are about to be alienated from their children as they never have been before, just as one gigantic shift.  so, as usual, don is ahead of the times.as for the other characters, fascinating things are going on for them as well.  we can see that women who want to get out of the straight jacketed post war existence finally have a glimmer of hope for doing so.  peggy and joan are far from being as miserable as the men around them.  even trudy campbell begins to show her mettle!the creative workers, the artists, in the advertising business, also begin to look like people are going to look in decades ahead. they are also experimenting more with the changes in lifestyles. also, television is becoming more and more a vital part of everything going on, including advertising.  every time we are told a huge event has taken place it is via the tv, not by print or radio.the creator of this series, matthew weiner, is obviously very interested in this era and the huge societal changes which took place during it and would continue to take place at an ever faster rate.  as someone who came of age during this era, it is fascinating for me to look back and see it unfold from a much broader perspective.i think this season is well worth viewing but, again, i am a minority view here on amazon apparently.",5,a minority view here at amazon--i still love it,1368057600,"05 9, 2013",2013,2640,"['i', 'notice', '280', 'reviews', 'show', 'aggregate', 'rating', 'three', 'stars', 'i', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'amazon', 'viewers', 'general', 'seem', 'be', 'underwhelmed', 'show', 'i', 'have', 'been', 'reading', 'post', 'episode', 'online', 'listening', 'NPR', 'podcasts', 'Mad', 'Men', 'amazon', 'view', 'not', 'being', 'repeated', 'do', 'i', 'share', 'i', 'series', 'as', 'much', 'i', 'ever', 'did.take', 'look', 'poster', 'shown', 'page', 'show', 'don', 'coming', 'going', 'look', 'signs', 'disjointedness', 'art', 'work', 'not', 'uplifting', 'poster', 'season', 'end', '1967', 'then', 'jumps', 'right', '1968', 'country', 'whole', 'coming', 'apart', 'just', 'poster', 'not', 'just', 'don', 'draper', 'world', 'being', 'torn.at', 'end', 'last', 'season', 'much', 'was', 'made', 'woman', 'coming', 'up', 'don', 'asking', 'are', 'alone', 'much', 'been', 'written', 'meant', 'don', 'was', 'going', 'return', 'being', 'philanderer', 'i', 'looked', 'question', 'larger', 'sense', 'man', 'alone', 'forever', 'isolated', 'really', 'connecting', 'anyone', 'answer', 'obvious', 'probably', 'most', 'alone', 'man', 'one', 'could', 'ever', 'encounter', 'time', 'period', 'era', 'alienation', 'american', 'population', 'had', 'known', 'before', 'parents', 'are', 'be', 'alienated', 'children', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'before', 'just', 'one', 'gigantic', 'shift', 'so', 'usual', 'ahead', 'times.as', 'other', 'characters', 'fascinating', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'see', 'women', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'straight', 'jacketed', 'post', 'war', 'existence', 'finally', 'have', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'doing', 'so', 'peggy', 'joan', 'are', 'far', 'being', 'as', 'miserable', 'men', 'even', 'trudy', 'campbell', 'show', 'mettle', 'creative', 'workers', 'artists', 'advertising', 'business', 'also', 'begin', 'look', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'look', 'decades', 'ahead', 'are', 'also', 'experimenting', 'more', 'changes', 'lifestyles', 'also', 'television', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'vital', 'part', 'everything', 'going', 'including', 'advertising', 'time', 'are', 'told', 'huge', 'event', 'taken', 'place', 'tv', 'not', 'print', 'radio.the', 'creator', 'series', 'matthew', 'weiner', 'obviously', 'very', 'interested', 'era', 'huge', 'societal', 'changes', 'took', 'place', 'would', 'continue', 'take', 'place', 'ever', 'faster', 'rate', 'someone', 'who', 'came', 'age', 'era', 'fascinating', 'look', 'back', 'see', 'unfold', 'much', 'broader', 'perspective.i', 'think', 'season', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing', 'again', 'i', 'am', 'minority', 'view', 'here', 'amazon', 'apparently']",N/A

Initially I found it slow, but interesting as it took me back to my youth and the lens through which the TV presented the world.  As the characters developed I became hooked and liked the show more as I started getting vested in the characters and impressed with the portrayal of the era's the show took the viewer through as it went from years of unprecedented economic stability and a society quite different from today and seeing the development of the characters and the period of change that forever changed our society.  The whole time as seen through an industry that is paid to portray life as being better because of things the sponsors sell.  An interesting perspective to begin with, but one used as the basis for the writing of the show.  Mad Men is a show that takes time to enjoy and really requires watching the entire series since the things happening in season 6 are powerful because of how they relate to the many things that proceeded them in prior episodes and seasons.  I purchased season 6 to watch through Amazon's Instant Video so as for the missing extra's from the DVD's I was unaffected.  As for the season itself I found it the best to date as the events continue to get larger since they occur in the context of a group of fully developed characters.  So I thought more happened in the Season than several of the earlier ones combined.  Such is the nature of a story with a lot of character depth.  It never seems to leave me lacking for surprise either as both my wife and I have actually yelled at the characters on screen for being so ____________!!!  I like that it inspires that sort of emotion as I normally only get that from a good book.  While it could be said the story is a soap opera the ties to history and the whole industry used as the backdrop and the impact it has on our society makes it far deeper and interesting.  5 years ago I would have thought Don would have crashed and burned by now and I wouldn't care, but I'm hooked and will watch and see how things turn out hoping that the destination is as good as the ride.",5,Best so far,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,2202,"['Mad', 'Men', 'was', 'show', 'started', 'watching', 'was', 'when', 'had', 'time', 'watch', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'found', 'more', 'interesting', 'Initially', 'found', 'slow', 'interesting', 'took', 'back', 'youth', 'lens', 'TV', 'presented', 'world', 'characters', 'developed', 'became', 'hooked', 'liked', 'show', 'more', 'started', 'getting', 'vested', 'characters', 'impressed', 'portrayal', 'era', 'show', 'took', 'viewer', 'went', 'years', 'unprecedented', 'economic', 'stability', 'society', 'quite', 'different', 'today', 'seeing', 'development', 'characters', 'period', 'change', 'forever', 'changed', 'society', 'whole', 'time', 'seen', 'industry', 'paid', 'portray', 'life', 'being', 'better', 'things', 'sponsors', 'sell', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'begin', 'one', 'used', 'basis', 'writing', 'show', 'Mad', 'Men', 'show', 'time', 'enjoy', 'really', 'watching', 'entire', 'series', 'things', 'happening', 'season', '6', 'are', 'powerful', 'how', 'relate', 'many', 'things', 'proceeded', 'prior', 'episodes', 'seasons', 'purchased', 'season', '6', 'watch', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'so', 'as', 'missing', 'extra', 'DVD', 'was', 'unaffected', 'season', 'found', 'best', 'date', 'events', 'continue', 'get', 'larger', 'occur', 'context', 'group', 'fully', 'developed', 'characters', 'thought', 'more', 'happened', 'Season', 'several', 'earlier', 'ones', 'combined', 'Such', 'nature', 'story', 'lot', 'character', 'depth', 'never', 'leave', 'lacking', 'surprise', 'wife', 'have', 'actually', 'yelled', 'characters', 'screen', 'being', 'so', '____________', 'like', 'sort', 'emotion', 'normally', 'only', 'get', 'good', 'book', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'story', 'soap', 'ties', 'history', 'whole', 'industry', 'used', 'backdrop', 'impact', 'society', 'far', 'deeper', 'interesting', '5', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Don', 'would', 'have', 'crashed', 'burned', 'now', 'would', ""n't"", 'care', ""'m"", 'hooked', 'will', 'watch', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'hoping', 'destination', 'as', 'good', 'ride']",N/A

But I loved this season anyway I generally just love this show and even in the slower episodes I still derive some pleasure from learning more about these interesting characters.I will update this review at the end of the season with my thoughts on where it stands in relation to other seasons.Thanks for readingPS - If you are watching season six Google "" if mad men took place on Facebook"" it is super funny and is a nice way to recap each of the episodes of season six.",5,Episode 6 really turns on the Mad Men flair - GREAT TURNING POINT!,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,1051,"['WARNING', ""'re"", 'new', 'Mad', 'Men', 'watch', 'show', 'very', 'beginning', 'watch', 'single', 'episode', 'order', 'derive', 'most', 'show', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'TV', 'think', 'one', 'be', 'watched', 'order', 'more', 'other', ""'ll"", 'lose', 'so', 'much', 'important', 'character', 'development.I', 'really', 'think', 'time', 'writing', 'week', 'watched', 'episode', 'six', 'season', 'six', 'so', 'far', 'best', 'episode', 'season', 'turning', 'point', 'hope', 'rest', 'season', 'had', 'Mad', 'Men', 'flare', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'show', 'want', 'loved', 'season', 'anyway', 'generally', 'just', 'love', 'show', 'even', 'slower', 'episodes', 'still', 'derive', 'pleasure', 'learning', 'more', 'interesting', 'characters.I', 'will', 'update', 'review', 'end', 'season', 'thoughts', 'where', 'relation', 'other', 'seasons.Thanks', 'readingPS', 'are', 'watching', 'season', 'six', 'Google', 'mad', 'men', 'took', 'place', 'Facebook', 'super', 'funny', 'nice', 'way', 'recap', 'episodes', 'season', 'six']",N/A

What I liked was the acting and the addition of most of the new characters.  I also liked that the show broadened out and wasn't so focused on the relationship of Don and Megan.  It was great to have Betty back and also good to see Don and Betty reunite somewhat.Once again, as in Season 4, Don begins to spiral out of control but by the end of the season he has allowed himself to go into freefall.  Peggy and Joan have come into their own and are emotionally the two strongest characters on the show.  Roger is still Roger, but seems to have taken a back seat this season to other characters, which was a shame.I still wanted to throw something at the screen every time I heard Megan sigh and watched her emote.  I don't think I have seen acting that bad since the 60's.  One of the high points of Season 6 was that she was in it a lot less than Season 5.  I realize not many share my point of view on this actress or character, but she was the main reason I did not purchase Season 5.Most of the episodes in Season 6 were interesting and ones that you would want to watch again, but as with season 5, there seemed to be a lot of dropped story lines.  At the end of season 5, Megan's friend looks at Don as says ""are you alone?""....Don looks up, the season ends and we never know if he got together with the friend she wanted to introduce him to or not. Also, no retribution for Megan stabbing her friend in the back regarding the shoe commercial, in fact we never saw or heard from any of her acting friends again.  Season 6 led up to a confrontation between Don and Arnie over Sylvia, but again that never happened.  The same with the Avon account that Joan was bringing to the firm.  She cut Pete out, there was tension and then the fake phone call, and nothing more ever mentioned about this account again.I really didn't like the last episode though and without putting in a spoiler, none of it rang true, especially regarding the actions and consequences of Don and Peggy, and Joan sitting in judgment of Don at the partner's meeting.  Not any part of this was believable.  I also think it would have been more interesting had the last episode been a two part episode, rather than the first episode.I still love this show and look forward to Season 7, the last season.  Wonderful as it has been, it's probably time for it all to end because it is becoming a little long in the tooth.  You can feel the writers straining for ideas.

The new ad agency is booming, and business is almost too good. Meanwhile, the Vietnam War has heated past the boiling point, the counterculture has hit the mainstream, and everyone is turning on, if not actually dropping out, while ""women's lib""-style feminism is still bubbling up, just barely off the radar. Meanwhile, Don Draper seems to be still stuck in the hard-drinking swinger mentality of the previous decade: will he be able to make the scene in the psychedelic Sixties? The answer may surprise you.Several episodes are historical set pieces: the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Bobby Kennedy loom as large on the show as they did in real life (although if I'm being totally honest, these episodes seems a bit forced: their earlier evocations of JFK's assassination and the Cuban Missile Crisis had a richer, more convincing texture...)Perhaps the most evocative historical references here are the fab, eye-popping fashion, with bold, brightly colored pop-art prints and dynamic cuts typical of the late '60s -- not the shabby tie-dye stereotypes that became Hollywood's ""Sixties"" shorthand in the '80s and '90s. The ""Mad Men"" costume department really went to town on this season and, even though I'm hardly a fashion follower myself, I found a lot of the women's fashion that came up in this season to be consistently fresh and exciting. The visual look of this season's clothing was truly stunning: take that, ""Project Runway""!!The narrative arc has its ups and downs, a couple of plot points I didn't totally buy, but overall it's another strong season with slow, deliberate pacing, admirable period detail, complex and often troubling character growth, and a cliffhanger ending that sets Season Seven up to be another doozy.

But I must say that this season has been a disappointment on almost every level.The fact that ""Mad Men"" never really had much of a plot didn't bother me before because this show was always first and foremost about character development.  Of course, it was also brilliantly written, acted, and produced, which didn't hurt.  Maybe it's the era -- as a child of the seventies, I never much cared for my own coming-of-age period.  I hate the seventies fashions, loved the music, didn't really get the politics, and felt it was all just so lacking in glamour compared to the sixties.  To me, that was where ""Mad Men"" belonged and where they should have ended it.Don Draper is deconstructing before our eyes this season, as he has seemed to in other seasons as well, but this has a different tone.  It's almost like the very dark period of ""The Sopranos"" when Tony got so dark and hideous even James Gandolfini wanted to kill him.  His philandering seems pointless and even he doesn't like it very much.  It's almost as if some alter-ego drives him to do this, and his kinkiness seems forced too.  Megan is a sort of flower-child narcissist -- albeit a very sweet one -- who really hasn't had much to do this season and their marriage seems beside the point.  Peggy's character has been interesting, as has Joan's, and I wish they would give them more to do.  As for Pete Campbell, his character is off-the-charts revolting.  Vincent Kartheiser is really over-acting in almost every episode and I have to fight myself not to turn it off.I really miss Betty.  I never thought i would say that, but I do.  I hate the way they've fattened her up and dyed her hair black.  She was always so beautiful to watch and her clothes were so gorgeous, and I loved to hate her.  I don't get why they've reduced her role so much, but I do think it's a mistake.  Everyone else I talk to feels the same way.Oh well.  The last two episodes --""The Man With a Plan"" and ""The Crash"" were far better.  Maybe there's hope.  But I still think they should have killed it at the end of last season.

In fact we've come back around and started over in season 1. But, as far as season 6 goes, it was everything you'd expect from this excellent series. (Here come spoilers) The theme of the season, I think, is falling from grace. Don Draper falls the hardest and furthest, eventually being suspended from the firm for tanking a presentation to Hershey Chocolate executives by giving them a no-holds-barred description of his childhood. By that point in the last episode, Meagan has already left him, he has become a full-fledged problem drinker, and he is alienated from his daughter, who caught him in an extremely compromising position with another woman. At the same time, Trudy finally gets to the end of her rope with Pete Campbell, and throws him out. The backdrop for all of this is 1968, a tumultuous year in history that saw the assassination of MLK and Robert Kennedy, so the United States is also falling from grace in a manner of speaking. As usual, the writers skillfully blend true life with fiction. As the season ends, there are hints that the fortunes of the characters have bottomed out - Sterling Cooper & Partners is starting a West Coast office and it seems like that resulted in an overall feeling of optimism as the season ended. The last scene with Don and his children also leads one to think he will redeem himself in season 7.On a side note, this was the first series I've ever streamed from Amazon (using a Roku device) and I was very happy with it.

Alas, this is also true for MAD MEN, one of the most beautifully accomplished series of the last ten years. In this, its sixth season, nothing seems as new or as interesting anymore for the writers, as story tricks that seemed tremendously inventive in seasons past (hallucinatory drug use, the central ad agency re-branding itself and going through a major personnel shift, etc.) recur here in mostly tired ways, and Don Draper (the series' antihero) seems caught in a pattern of marital infidelities we've of course seen before quite a bit. All this would seem forgivable if so many characters weren't by this point so sour and unpleasant. Certainly the contempt that ad men have for their clients' limitations and timidities has been a major theme in the series, but Don and Peggy by this point (initially at different agencies) seem so consistently condescending and irritable that it's hard to root for their campaigns very much or care whether they can score new clients. There are some interesting ideas this season, but not many. Despite the wonderful work of newcomer to the show Linda Cardellini as Don's new neighbor and mistress, this has been by far the series' weakest season.The DVD set of the sixth season is equally disappointing: there is not a single episode commentary, which makes buying the set mostly pointless because most episodes can be seen anyway on cable on-demand services anyway. Had I know this I would not have bought the set: getting to hear the actors' and especially the writers' ideas behind the series has been one of the most entertaining part of the DVD sets for this show previously.

Just look at some of those outfits! And now finally the tempo really starts to pick up and matters become engrossing.Spoiler alert.This end of season features a shocker with Don and his ad agency. He confronts his own inner demons with his Dick Whitman persona - or should that be the other way around? Is he really on a downward spiral (again!)? Perhaps this is all a part of his growth process?Will his past finally catch up with him? Will he fall apart? In general, though Don has certainly got himself into awkward situations over the years, he has proven to be quite resourceful in dealing and coping with them.Matt Weiner has said that the next Series 7 is to be the last. It is set to air in April 2014. This Season 6 certainly ends in great alignment for the grand finale of Season 7.Can Don turn things around in the situation he now finds himself in?",5,SEASON 6,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,1310,"['Season', '6', 'Mad', 'Men', 'circa', 'Xmas', '1967', 'as', 'addictive', 'series', 'ever', 'season', 'composed', '13', 'episodes.Things', 'take', 'little', 'time', 'warm', 'up', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'slightly', 'frayed', 'edges', 'not', 'quite', 'sharp', 'early', 'still', 'as', 'interesting', 'ever', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Bobby', 'Kennedy', 'assasinations', 'appear', 'tv', 'screens', 'episodes', 'fix', 'time', 'so', 'move', 'swinging', 'sixties', 'Just', 'look', 'outfits', 'now', 'finally', 'tempo', 'really', 'pick', 'up', 'matters', 'become', 'alert.This', 'end', 'season', 'features', 'shocker', 'Don', 'ad', 'agency', 'own', 'inner', 'demons', 'Dick', 'Whitman', 'should', 'be', 'other', 'way', 'really', 'downward', 'spiral', 'again', 'Perhaps', 'part', 'growth', 'process', 'Will', 'past', 'finally', 'catch', 'up', 'Will', 'fall', 'apart', 'general', 'Don', 'certainly', 'got', 'awkward', 'situations', 'years', 'proven', 'be', 'quite', 'resourceful', 'dealing', 'coping', 'them.Matt', 'Weiner', 'said', 'next', 'Series', '7', 'be', 'last', 'set', 'air', 'April', '2014', 'Season', '6', 'certainly', 'great', 'alignment', 'grand', 'finale', 'Season', '7.Can', 'Don', 'turn', 'things', 'situation', 'now']",N/A

The lead character, Don Draper surprisingly emerges as a bit of a brute at times, yet he pays for that. Viewers learn more insights into Don&#8217;s childhood and how that now affects his behavior. This is an excellent show. The acting is great. The characters are flawed, yet in captivating ways so viewers love following them. This series is well written.

As the new millennium keeps disappointing us, TV shows set on the 50's and the 60's (once a rarity) keep growing in numbers. Many have tried and failed. MAD MEN tried and closed the deal. And have been doing so for 6 seasons now.Meet Don Draper (Jon Ham), a Madison Avenue water-walker (and based on the real life ad men Draper Daniels and Rosser Reeves). He is an enigma wrapped in a mystery. He is brilliant and secretive. He wants to keep walking the tight rope with no safety net. And definitely no contract. He is a chain-smoking, hard liqueur guzzling, womanizing alpha male. He is a loving father of three, married to a picture-perfect ex model. He has it all. And yet he cannot find peace. Because he learned early on that the world is always yawning at your heels, eager to yank everything you love away.From bursting with joie-de-vivre Roger Sterling (hilarious John Slattery) and ever scheming Pete Cambell (baby-faced Vincent Kartheiser) to the gorgeous women (such as barbie January Jones and refined Jessica Par&eacute; as his first and second wife, respectively), the cast is one perfect pick after another. And the writing is brilliant, reproducing the tastes and smells and nuisances of the era around Camelot, while drawing you in to the personal stories of characters polished yet inevitably flawed.The 50's and the 60's were before my time so it is not nostalgia that makes me love the show. Yes, I find the era mesmerizing and (probably undeservingly) less complicated. If nothing else, though, back then they knew how to dress. Women looked feminine and men looked manly. You see January Jones on the red carpet, for example, all dressed up and groomed for a Hollywood function - and that modern image cannot hold a candle to herself dressed for everyday(!) life in the early 60's. When did we loose it? When did we decide men should stop wearing suits and hats and women should start wearing sweat-suits outside the house? I, for one, blame the hippies!This is one of the best TV shows ever and this box-set includes the ongoing season 6. Season 7 has been green-lighted  whereas we can only hope that the show will not stop there. As I have said again before, good TV is best watched on DVD. Make weekends out of it. It is much more enjoyable to watch an entire season in a couple of days than having to wait week(s) between episodes. And (quite ironically, in this case), you will not have to suffer the...commercials.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5,"DANCING BEANS, HELD UP WITH NOTHING",1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,2586,"['When', 'things', 'get', 'bad', 'tend', 'look', 'past', 'bleaker', 'future', 'further', 'back', 'search', 'comfort', 'new', 'millennium', 'disappointing', 'TV', 'shows', 'set', '50', '60', 'once', 'rarity', 'keep', 'growing', 'numbers', 'Many', 'have', 'tried', 'failed', 'MAD', 'MEN', 'tried', 'closed', 'deal', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'so', '6', 'seasons', 'now.Meet', 'Don', 'Draper', 'Jon', 'Ham', 'Madison', 'Avenue', 'water-walker', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'ad', 'men', 'Draper', 'Daniels', 'Rosser', 'Reeves', 'enigma', 'wrapped', 'mystery', 'brilliant', 'secretive', 'keep', 'walking', 'tight', 'rope', 'safety', 'net', 'definitely', 'contract', 'chain-smoking', 'hard', 'liqueur', 'guzzling', 'womanizing', 'alpha', 'male', 'loving', 'father', 'three', 'married', 'picture-perfect', 'ex', 'model', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'peace', 'learned', 'early', 'world', 'always', 'yawning', 'heels', 'eager', 'yank', 'everything', 'love', 'bursting', 'joie-de-vivre', 'Roger', 'Sterling', 'hilarious', 'John', 'Slattery', 'ever', 'scheming', 'Pete', 'Cambell', 'baby-faced', 'Vincent', 'Kartheiser', 'gorgeous', 'women', 'such', 'barbie', 'January', 'Jones', 'refined', 'Jessica', 'Par', 'eacute', 'first', 'second', 'wife', 'respectively', 'cast', 'one', 'perfect', 'pick', 'writing', 'brilliant', 'reproducing', 'tastes', 'smells', 'nuisances', 'era', 'Camelot', 'drawing', 'personal', 'stories', 'characters', 'polished', 'yet', 'inevitably', '50', '60', 'were', 'time', 'not', 'nostalgia', 'love', 'show', 'Yes', 'find', 'era', 'mesmerizing', 'probably', 'undeservingly', 'less', 'complicated', 'nothing', 'else', 'back', 'then', 'knew', 'how', 'dress', 'Women', 'looked', 'feminine', 'men', 'looked', 'manly', 'see', 'January', 'Jones', 'red', 'carpet', 'example', 'dressed', 'up', 'groomed', 'Hollywood', 'function', 'modern', 'image', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'herself', 'dressed', 'everyday', 'life', 'early', '60', 'When', 'did', 'loose', 'When', 'did', 'decide', 'men', 'should', 'stop', 'wearing', 'suits', 'hats', 'women', 'should', 'start', 'wearing', 'sweat-suits', 'house', 'one', 'hippies', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'shows', 'ever', 'box-set', 'ongoing', 'season', '6', 'Season', '7', 'been', 'green-lighted', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'show', 'will', 'not', 'stop', 'there', 'have', 'said', 'again', 'before', 'good', 'TV', 'best', 'watched', 'DVD', 'Make', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'entire', 'season', 'couple', 'days', 'having', 'wait', 'week', 'episodes', 'quite', 'ironically', 'case', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'suffer', 'commercials.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

Even worse is any scene involving Betty. Her one-note delivery has not been enhanced by the ""fat"" make-up that they have her in. We still have no idea who Betty is and we don't care. We know her to be petty, mean, proper and once in a while strangely kind, but January Jones is unable to endow her with depth (or shallowness) and her excursions just suck oxygen from the screen. But wait, there is relief! Every time Elisabeth Moss is on the screen it feels as if she is single-handedly pulling that screen into order and gifting the scene with coherence. What we see her do isn't very interesting, but we watch with relief because Peggy works as a character. Unfortunately, Peggy can't salvage the show. Only Don Draper could do that, and he has to be one of the most deadly lotharios ever to hit the culture. His hidden past seems played out now; his philandering is boring even to him; one really wouldn't want to be him anymore. Roger too has become an incoherent character, a mouthpiece for second-rate philosophizing whose final explosion of tears at his mom's death didn't read as real. And what of Joan? Christina Hendricks in this episode finally gets to be just a jutting bosom. Great work, Mr Weiner. You just don't know what to do with this fine actress, do you? She can't be part of the Peggy success arc, so what is to become of her? She is just good at what she does, and straightforward about it. As Roger says, Joan will know what to do. Indeed, but will you? I guess she needs some adversity, and then are you going to have Don finally turn to her, or what? It's a tough one. If you solve it, you might have a new storyline that could save the series, which used to be the best thing on TV.",1,"bad script, bad make-up, bad story - what's not to like?",1365897600,"04 14, 2013",2013,2460,"['have', 'read', 'nuanced', 'respectful', 'recap/reviews', 'Huffpost', 'elsewhere', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'even', 'tried', 'watch', 'opening', 'double', 'episode', 'again', 'see', 'could', 'find', 'profundity', 'symbolism', 'saw', 'was', 'stodgy', 'Don', 'being', 'embarassed', 'show', 'human', 'joy', 'play', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'dance', 'Don', 'wife', 'having', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'most', 'tacky', 'conventional', 'look', 'Hawaii', 'somehow', 'becoming', 'long', 'string', 'epiphanies', 'Don', 'when', 'west', 'never', 'last', 'more', 'one', 'episode', 'Then', 'distracted', 'Don', 'pitch', 'include', 'product', 'being', 'pitched', 'death', 'wish', 'pitch', 'surely', 'Don', 'Draper', 'know', 'would', 'never', 'make', 'Even', 'worse', 'scene', 'involving', 'Betty', 'one-note', 'delivery', 'not', 'been', 'enhanced', 'fat', 'make-up', 'have', 'still', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'Betty', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'know', 'be', 'petty', 'mean', 'proper', 'once', 'while', 'strangely', 'kind', 'January', 'Jones', 'unable', 'endow', 'depth', 'shallowness', 'excursions', 'just', 'suck', 'oxygen', 'screen', 'wait', 'relief', 'time', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'screen', 'single-handedly', 'pulling', 'screen', 'order', 'gifting', 'scene', 'coherence', 'What', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'watch', 'relief', 'Peggy', 'character', 'Unfortunately', 'Peggy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'salvage', 'show', 'Only', 'Don', 'Draper', 'could', 'do', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'deadly', 'lotharios', 'ever', 'hit', 'culture', 'hidden', 'past', 'played', 'out', 'now', 'philandering', 'boring', 'even', 'one', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'anymore', 'Roger', 'too', 'become', 'incoherent', 'character', 'mouthpiece', 'second-rate', 'philosophizing', 'final', 'explosion', 'tears', 'mom', 'death', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'real', 'what', 'Joan', 'Christina', 'Hendricks', 'episode', 'finally', 'be', 'just', 'jutting', 'bosom', 'Great', 'work', 'Mr', 'Weiner', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'fine', 'actress', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'part', 'Peggy', 'success', 'arc', 'what', 'become', 'just', 'good', 'what', 'straightforward', 'Roger', 'Joan', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'Indeed', 'will', 'guess', 'adversity', 'then', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'Don', 'finally', 'turn', 'what', 'tough', 'one', 'solve', 'might', 'have', 'new', 'storyline', 'could', 'save', 'series', 'used', 'be', 'best', 'thing', 'TV']",N/A

First impression; All of the guys look like dorks now. Who gave Pete those sideburns? Right? Also, the sauve late fifties early sixties-isms have subtley faded into a new era, and while old fans were hoping for a perpetual 1962, it is in fact now, 1968.

Though, I won't lie, I was always more of a Beatles blue album guy, than a red album guy.While the episodes involving the art of the sell and the art of the ad may be a thing of the past, the show seems eager to flow with the pace of a decade that is memorialized in not one but two (if not several more) colors. These episodes for me glorify the art of the art, which I have to imagine was what the ad men at the time were seeking out as well.But the swinging style is still alive here.

A sexually amoral compulsive womanizer/empathetic altruist going into PTSD (post tryst?)? Can your usual audience stand it? Please, though, protect the doc. I like him and unless he happens to be a complete psychopath himself, let him find his muse and go off to join M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res or some such. But, the ""he already intuitively knows"" thing would be a disappointment to my perception of your ability. Anyway, my concern for him makes the tryst scenes with his wife just too uncomfortable, that you will have him walk in unknowing. I don't watch TV much (John and Stephen only on the net) but, during a recent period of some stress and reading wasn't working, ran out of movies and docus and watched all 5 previous seasons back to back (and belly to belly) stoned on my tuchus which seems to have made me a fan of the same level of credulity as your autograph seeker in Hawaii. Self-image damaging but you make it easy. Anyway, now sans dope, I still find your writing very absorbing.

1639549,AP3B615GM191G,B00BUUAV08,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","After two of the best seasons (4-5) in show history, the Sixth Season of &#34;Mad Men&#34; starts off a bit slow.  For the first 3-4 episodes it doesn't really seem like anything is happening, or when things do happen they don't seem all that consequential.  In short order, however, as only a show like this can seem to do, all of a sudden the drama comes together again to make for marathon viewing.(Warning: Minor Spoilers Ahead)As this season of &#34;Mad Men&#34; begins, many changes are keenly evident.  Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) now works at a different advertising agency, while Donald Draper (Jon Hamm) is struggling to lead HIS company to the heights they would like to reach.  Just when it seems like Don & Peggy have hit their respective low points, though, a unique opportunity arises that could be mutual beneficial...as long as both sides can swallow a bit of pride.As usual, this show is best when centered around Don and his family(s).  Megan Draper (Jessica Pare) plays a significant role in the proceedings, as does young Sally (Kiernan Shipka).  An entire episode is even devoted to Don's relationship with his now-growing son.  Even Betty (January Jones) returns again for a key character arc towards the back end of the season.Of course, the ensemble cast is still a delight.  Viewers are now so invested in the characters that we want to &#34;see how it all turns out&#34;.  I won't list all the names here, but suffice it to say that the &#34;old gang&#34; is still as present as ever.  Personal favorites for me include Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser), the guy we all love to hate, and Roger Sterling (John Slattery), who cracks more jokes this season than perhaps any previous (and that is quite a feat!).  Even Harry Crane (Rich Sommer) has some meaty scenes.My only knock on this season is that it starts out very slow (thus the four-star rating).  The first 3-4 episodes feel a bit scatter-brained and disjointed.  I have never seen a show quite like &#34;Mad Men&#34;, though, with its ability to suddenly &#34;throw a switch&#34; (I'm sure it's more difficult than that) and suddenly, in a one-episode span, start producing top-notch drama and character development again.  That is exactly what happens here...after those meandering 3-4 efforts.Overall, I don't see why this season gets such shaky reviews here on Amazon.  It might be not quite as good as, say, Seasons 1, 4, and 5, but it is high-quality viewing nonetheless.  If you liked the five seasons previous, I can't imagine you'll finding anything here to dissuade you.",4,Starts Slow But Quickly Gets Back On Track,1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,2566,"['two', 'best', 'seasons', '4-5', 'show', 'history', 'Sixth', 'Season', '34', 'Mad', 'Men', '34', 'bit', 'slow', 'first', '3-4', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'anything', 'happening', 'when', 'things', 'do', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'consequential', 'short', 'order', 'however', 'only', 'show', 'can', 'seem', 'do', 'sudden', 'drama', 'together', 'again', 'make', 'marathon', 'viewing', 'Warning', 'Minor', 'Spoilers', 'Ahead', 'season', '34', 'Mad', 'Men', '34', 'begins', 'many', 'changes', 'are', 'keenly', 'evident', 'Peggy', 'Olson', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'now', 'different', 'advertising', 'agency', 'Donald', 'Draper', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'struggling', 'lead', 'HIS', 'company', 'heights', 'would', 'like', 'reach', 'Just', 'when', 'Don', 'Peggy', 'have', 'hit', 'respective', 'low', 'points', 'though', 'unique', 'opportunity', 'arises', 'could', 'be', 'mutual', 'beneficial', 'as', 'long', 'sides', 'can', 'swallow', 'bit', 'pride.As', 'usual', 'show', 'best', 'when', 'centered', 'Don', 'family', 's', 'Megan', 'Draper', 'Jessica', 'Pare', 'significant', 'role', 'proceedings', 'young', 'Sally', 'Kiernan', 'Shipka', 'entire', 'episode', 'even', 'devoted', 'Don', 'relationship', 'now-growing', 'son', 'Even', 'Betty', 'January', 'Jones', 'again', 'key', 'character', 'arc', 'back', 'end', 'season.Of', 'course', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'still', 'delight', 'Viewers', 'are', 'now', 'so', 'invested', 'characters', 'want', '34', 'see', 'how', 'out', '34', 'wo', ""n't"", 'list', 'names', 'here', 'say', '34', 'old', 'gang', '34', 'still', 'as', 'present', 'ever', 'Personal', 'favorites', 'include', 'Pete', 'Campbell', 'Vincent', 'Kartheiser', 'guy', 'love', 'hate', 'Roger', 'Sterling', 'John', 'Slattery', 'who', 'more', 'jokes', 'season', 'perhaps', 'previous', 'quite', 'feat', 'Even', 'Harry', 'Crane', 'Rich', 'Sommer', 'meaty', 'scenes.My', 'only', 'knock', 'season', 'out', 'very', 'slow', 'thus', 'four-star', 'rating', 'first', '3-4', 'episodes', 'feel', 'bit', 'scatter-brained', 'disjointed', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'quite', '34', 'Mad', 'Men', '34', 'ability', 'suddenly', '34', 'throw', 'switch', '34', ""'m"", 'sure', 'more', 'difficult', 'suddenly', 'one-episode', 'span', 'start', 'producing', 'top-notch', 'drama', 'character', 'development', 'again', 'exactly', 'what', 'here', 'meandering', '3-4', 'efforts.Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'season', 'such', 'shaky', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'might', 'be', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'say', 'Seasons', '1', '4', '5', 'high-quality', 'viewing', 'nonetheless', 'liked', 'five', 'seasons', 'previous', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', ""'ll"", 'finding', 'anything', 'here', 'dissuade']",N/A
