This compilation sets the stage for That Girl, the wildly-popular television comedy that broke new ground. The premise may seem tame today, a series of sketches about a stylish, vivacious young actress zooming around New York, fending off advances from producers,  attending caattle-call auditions and juggling low-paying jobs to pay the rent on her fabulous East Side apartment. Casting was inspired: it's impossible to imagine anyone but  Marlo Thomas as dreamy-eyed Anne Marie, and Ted Bessell as her faithful boyfriend Donald Hollinger. This first series doesn't quite measure up to the second. There are some awkward scripts and contrived plots. But if you want the full immersion in That Girl, opt for this sampler of the first season to get the full effect of the series.",5,"Groundbreaking for its time, and still watchable!",1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,884,"['Born', 'long', '1960s', 'Curious', 'how', 'mother', 'looked', 'wanted', 'teens', 'twenties', 'compilation', 'stage', 'Girl', 'wildly-popular', 'television', 'comedy', 'broke', 'new', 'ground', 'premise', 'may', 'seem', 'tame', 'today', 'series', 'sketches', 'stylish', 'vivacious', 'young', 'actress', 'zooming', 'New', 'York', 'fending', 'off', 'advances', 'producers', 'attending', 'caattle-call', 'auditions', 'juggling', 'low-paying', 'jobs', 'pay', 'rent', 'fabulous', 'East', 'Side', 'apartment', 'Casting', 'was', 'inspired', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'Marlo', 'Thomas', 'dreamy-eyed', 'Anne', 'Marie', 'Ted', 'Bessell', 'faithful', 'boyfriend', 'Donald', 'Hollinger', 'first', 'series', ""n't"", 'quite', 'measure', 'up', 'second', 'are', 'awkward', 'scripts', 'contrived', 'plots', 'want', 'full', 'immersion', 'Girl', 'opt', 'sampler', 'first', 'season', 'get', 'full', 'effect', 'series']","That Girl: Season 1, Vol. 1"
1095300,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000ULM980,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","THAT GIRL is one of the benchmark sitcoms of the 1960's, starring adorable Marlo Thomas as Ann Marie, an actress looking to make her mark in New York.  Ted Bessell is Ann's ever-faithful boyfriend Donald Hollinger.  This DVD presents four episodes from the landmark first season, along with some great extras.
