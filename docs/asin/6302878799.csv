This movie is the first ever Superman movie but not the first to wear the tights and sour the sky a man named Kirk Allen played him in two serials right before the movie was made but by far George does a better job(He actually with out a doubt looks like the Superman at that time) after the movie was made it wasn't long after that the TV show was made. Anyway The film starts out in an old western town home the deepest man drilled hole ever. Now with that title the news papers have to have their scoop on the story so they send the best that anyone has to offer Ms. Lois Lane and her partner the clumsy Mr. Clark Kent. When they arrive they find out that the world can't get it's scoop on the hole for it's been shut down, and things look very suspisus. Lois and Clark stay at the towns hotel for the night and are going to leave in the morning. At the hotel Clark has the earge to check out the hole site, he insist that Lois stays there but she goes along with him. When they arrive at the site they see that Pop an old mine worker lies dead in his shack. Lois calls it heart attack but Clark thinks that it might be something far worse then just a simple hear attack. He want's to take a look around the shed and tells Lois to call a doctor. He leaves and while Lois is on the phone she sees something out of this world! Two creators that have giant heads and small bodies covered with fur peak through the window to observe Lois. She screams!Clark hears this and rushes back into the shack to see Lois dazed she wont tell him what happened until the shack is filled with doctors, police, and the sites director. She tells them the story but no one really believes her except Clark. When everyone leaves except The director and Clark just to make sure everything is in peace, Clark confronts the director. He says he knows that he's hiding something for he discovered hidden tools. The director spills out a story that even Clark Kent mild manner reporter of the Daily Planet wouldn't dare to print. It appears when the drill reached the deepest any drill had gone before, the soil was tested and it had parts of radium in it. The director with fear that the men might get a decease closes the site. Clark and the director both think that these creators came from that hole and could posses radium in their skin, so they must go to the town and worn the people. But when they reach town word had been spread that aliens have come to Earth and have killed so a mob had formed and they want blood. Clark tells them that these beings came from the center of the Earth and mean them no harm and tells them that they must stop their raid but he doesn't convince them, the mob goes into a rampage when a scream is heard in a near by house. Clark goes into the back of the hotel and rips open his shirt and turns into the man of steal and flys off towards the house(Now unlike the serial he does fly there is no animation involved) Superman arrives infront of the house to stop the mob. He stops most of them but it's leader and a few others with some hounds go off into the outskirts of town to kill the mole men. On top of a bridge the two mole men crossing when a spot light hits their faces, fear strikes their eyes. The men are about to fire their guns at them but superman jumps infront of them and stops the bullet with his chest. He tells the mob that they are radio active and if they fall into the water they'll contaminate the water supplies of the town. One of the mob members tries to take down Superman but with one punch Superman Stops him, but with that one punch the man with the gun fires his gun at the one of the mole men and hits him right in the chest, the furry little critter starts to fall off the bridge!!! Now if you want the conclusion of this buy the movie it's great any Superman fan won't be disappointed and if your a fan of science fiction you'll love it too. I only wish this movie was on DVD it really needs to be.",5,"Witness horror, witness, suspence, it's all here!",1072656000,"12 29, 2003",2003,4052,"['outstanding', 'film', 'guy', 'wrote', 'review', 'movies', 'home', 'page', 'wrong', 'review', 'movie', 'first', 'ever', 'Superman', 'movie', 'not', 'first', 'wear', 'tights', 'sour', 'sky', 'man', 'named', 'Kirk', 'Allen', 'played', 'two', 'serials', 'right', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'far', 'George', 'better', 'job', 'actually', 'out', 'doubt', 'Superman', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'made', 'Anyway', 'film', 'out', 'old', 'western', 'town', 'home', 'deepest', 'man', 'drilled', 'hole', 'ever', 'Now', 'news', 'papers', 'have', 'have', 'scoop', 'story', 'send', 'best', 'anyone', 'offer', 'Ms.', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'partner', 'clumsy', 'Mr.', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'When', 'arrive', 'find', 'out', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'scoop', 'hole', 'been', 'shut', 'down', 'things', 'look', 'very', 'suspisus', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'stay', 'towns', 'hotel', 'night', 'are', 'going', 'leave', 'morning', 'hotel', 'Clark', 'earge', 'check', 'out', 'hole', 'site', 'insist', 'Lois', 'along', 'When', 'arrive', 'site', 'see', 'Pop', 'old', 'mine', 'worker', 'dead', 'shack', 'Lois', 'heart', 'attack', 'Clark', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'far', 'worse', 'then', 'just', 'simple', 'hear', 'attack', 'want', 'take', 'look', 'shed', 'Lois', 'call', 'doctor', 'Lois', 'phone', 'something', 'world', 'Two', 'creators', 'have', 'giant', 'heads', 'small', 'bodies', 'covered', 'fur', 'peak', 'window', 'observe', 'Lois', 'screams', 'Clark', 'back', 'shack', 'see', 'Lois', 'dazed', 'wont', 'tell', 'what', 'happened', 'shack', 'filled', 'doctors', 'police', 'sites', 'director', 'story', 'one', 'really', 'Clark', 'When', 'everyone', 'director', 'Clark', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'everything', 'peace', 'Clark', 'director', 'hiding', 'something', 'discovered', 'hidden', 'tools', 'director', 'out', 'story', 'even', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'mild', 'manner', 'reporter', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'would', ""n't"", 'dare', 'print', 'when', 'drill', 'reached', 'deepest', 'drill', 'had', 'gone', 'before', 'soil', 'was', 'tested', 'had', 'parts', 'radium', 'director', 'fear', 'men', 'might', 'get', 'decease', 'site', 'Clark', 'director', 'think', 'creators', 'came', 'hole', 'could', 'posses', 'radium', 'skin', 'must', 'go', 'town', 'worn', 'people', 'when', 'reach', 'town', 'word', 'had', 'been', 'spread', 'aliens', 'have', 'come', 'Earth', 'have', 'killed', 'so', 'mob', 'had', 'formed', 'want', 'blood', 'Clark', 'beings', 'came', 'center', 'Earth', 'mean', 'harm', 'must', 'stop', 'raid', ""n't"", 'convince', 'mob', 'rampage', 'when', 'scream', 'heard', 'near', 'house', 'Clark', 'back', 'hotel', 'rips', 'open', 'shirt', 'man', 'steal', 'flys', 'off', 'house', 'Now', 'serial', 'fly', 'animation', 'involved', 'Superman', 'infront', 'house', 'stop', 'mob', 'most', 'leader', 'few', 'others', 'hounds', 'go', 'off', 'outskirts', 'town', 'kill', 'mole', 'men', 'top', 'bridge', 'two', 'mole', 'men', 'crossing', 'when', 'spot', 'light', 'hits', 'fear', 'strikes', 'eyes', 'men', 'are', 'fire', 'guns', 'superman', 'jumps', 'infront', 'stops', 'bullet', 'chest', 'mob', 'are', 'radio', 'active', 'fall', 'water', ""'ll"", 'contaminate', 'water', 'supplies', 'town', 'One', 'mob', 'members', 'take', 'down', 'Superman', 'one', 'punch', 'Superman', 'Stops', 'one', 'punch', 'man', 'gun', 'gun', 'one', 'mole', 'men', 'hits', 'right', 'chest', 'furry', 'little', 'critter', 'fall', 'off', 'bridge', 'Now', 'want', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'great', 'Superman', 'fan', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'fan', 'science', 'fiction', ""'ll"", 'love', 'too', 'only', 'wish', 'movie', 'was', 'DVD', 'really', 'be']",N/A

Nesbitt ""NEZI""","[0, 0]",The Adventures of Superman is a treasured memory from days gone by!I well remember watching this after running home from school on Channel 4 WTTV owned by Sarkes-Tarzian in Bloomington IN (also the home to Sammy Terry - Many Pleasant Nightmares Sammy!!). But since we didn't have color TV until I bought one when I was working at Sears in the mid 1970's I never knew that about 50% of the episodes were in color. It's just a shame that the whole series wasn't filmed that way.  George Reeves was one of my heroes growing up along with Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris.When I feel nostalgic I will play 1 or 2 episodes to pick my spirits up!I would rate this a very high 8.75 to 9.25 - IF there was a way to watch the whole movie with some/most of the music used in the 2-part TV episodes this would be a perfect 10 out of 10.

I didn't see this film when it was brand new, but I am a fan of Superman. George Reeves plays the part of Clark Kent perfect, especially looking really good as Superman. The real stars of this movie are the little people who played the mole men. They never say anything in the movie, but a lot of expression is used and it is easy to feel sorry for them when they are treated wrong.The story starts off a little slow, but eventually gains a lot of momentum and stays that way to the end. I was sucked in to the story, when the mole man is stuck in the burning house, inside I was screaming ""Where are you Superman?! Help this guy out!""

343723,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,6302878799,Phil S.,"[1, 1]","Before ""Superman"" of TV became more and more a ""kid's show"", and before it even became a series, there was this movie with Reeves and Coates.This story, of a drilling site discovery just outside the small town of Silby, is so solid that it warrants a movie remake with all the technology and big names available.Interestingly enough, with Phyllis Coates as Lois, there would be very little period adjustment for her character. Before ""Women's Lib"" and ""Feminism"" in all fields including entertainment, Coates delivered a very strong portrayal, of a no-nonsense, actually somewhat embittered reporter not willing to let her associate Clark do all the heavy lifting: she refuses to hang back at the hotel while Clark investigates the suspicious site in the middle of the night. Of course, this character got ""sweetened"" for the series later shown in color. The early, black-and-white Lois fit the ""smart and sexy"" image of today. She could not be ""in love"" with Superman in the way Noel Neill (though ""smart and sexy"" in her own apprpoach) was later in the '50s; the idea is just hinted at in the '51 enterprise.Amazon reviewers have pointed out the lesser soundtrack used on the original film, but I found it effective. I'm sure we all agree that the cinematography and special effects are excellent.Interesting to watch George Reeves in this early take. Fans of the TV series will note a drop in energy level by the mid-'50s. Perhaps Reeves though this Super-hero thing wouldn't affect his progress. (About two years later he was edited out of ""From Here To Eternity"", apparently because of the kid-show identification, and one must surmise this took plenty of wind from his artistic sails).Footnote: It's been said that Elvis Presley enjoyed the TV show and I can contemplate Elvis mentally referencing Reeves' acting when he hit the soundstage.",5,For fans of Superman and Science Fiction/Adventure,1183852800,"07 8, 2007",2007,1846,"['Superman', 'TV', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'kid', 'show', 'even', 'became', 'series', 'was', 'movie', 'Reeves', 'Coates.This', 'story', 'drilling', 'site', 'discovery', 'just', 'small', 'town', 'Silby', 'so', 'solid', 'warrants', 'movie', 'remake', 'technology', 'big', 'names', 'available.Interestingly', 'enough', 'Phyllis', 'Coates', 'Lois', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'little', 'period', 'adjustment', 'character', 'Women', 'Lib', 'Feminism', 'fields', 'including', 'entertainment', 'Coates', 'delivered', 'very', 'strong', 'portrayal', 'no-nonsense', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'embittered', 'reporter', 'not', 'willing', 'let', 'associate', 'Clark', 'do', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'hang', 'back', 'hotel', 'Clark', 'suspicious', 'site', 'middle', 'night', 'course', 'character', 'got', 'sweetened', 'series', 'later', 'shown', 'color', 'early', 'black-and-white', 'Lois', 'fit', 'smart', 'sexy', 'image', 'today', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'love', 'Superman', 'way', 'Noel', 'Neill', 'smart', 'sexy', 'own', 'apprpoach', 'was', 'later', ""'50s"", 'idea', 'just', 'hinted', ""'51"", 'enterprise.Amazon', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'lesser', 'soundtrack', 'used', 'original', 'film', 'found', 'effective', ""'m"", 'sure', 'agree', 'cinematography', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'excellent.Interesting', 'watch', 'George', 'Reeves', 'early', 'take', 'Fans', 'TV', 'series', 'will', 'note', 'drop', 'energy', 'level', ""mid-'50s"", 'Perhaps', 'Super-hero', 'thing', 'would', ""n't"", 'affect', 'progress', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'edited', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'apparently', 'kid-show', 'identification', 'one', 'must', 'surmise', 'took', 'plenty', 'wind', 'artistic', 'sails', '.Footnote', 'been', 'said', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'enjoyed', 'TV', 'show', 'can', 'contemplate', 'Elvis', 'mentally', 'referencing', 'Reeves', 'acting', 'when', 'hit', 'soundstage']",N/A

As some of the other reviewers have noted, ""Superman and the Mole Men"" was later edited into a two-part episode for the George Reeves TV program, now rechristened as ""The Unknown People."" Sorry, folks, but in this case the ""edited for TV"" version is a distinct improvement and for one reason: THE MUSIC! The score used in the original movie is a pallid, third-rate job that does nothing to advance the action or to support the eerie, ""film noir"" feel of the camera work. But when the film was mixed down for presentation on TV, the show's producers had the genius to replace the film's soundtrack with some of the scariest, most vivid background scores then available.  (As a matter of fact, this weird and wonderful music - used over and over again as background music throughout the first, black-and -white season of the 1950's ""Adventures of Superman"" TV show - has been helpfully collected on CD by the Varese-Sarabande label. You can order it right here, at Amazon.com!The Adventures of Superman: Original Television Soundtrack (1950s TV Series)) Anyone who gets to know ""Superman and the Mole Men"" only through the original theatrical release with its substandard, tepid musical score will have no idea of how good the film really is, or understand how the effective use of great background music can turn a third-rate movie into a very good film.
