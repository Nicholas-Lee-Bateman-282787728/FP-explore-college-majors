1275135,AIB1J75JT2MGI,B002KLQ31C,"Bruce Nichols ""Coffeeman""","[11, 29]","Margaret Cho has an abundance of energy and charisma. She also has a great ability to tell a joke with proper timing. It's a shame that she wastes these talents on telling crude sex jokes when she could be using her unique position in the world of comedy (as an Asian American woman) to deliver some messages with substance. Clever insights in American daily life, politics and feminism would catapult her career.The depth of her jokes in Beautiful is so shallow that I am led to believe that Margaret is simply out of ideas. She should hire some writers or have her fans send her some jokes. In Beautiful, she is doing the same old shtick telling jokes about her sexual experiences and bodily fluids (for example: menstruation). How long she can keep going with this bit before she disappears into the abyss will be seen. I think she still has time to turn her career around and I just hope she does.",1,A Waste of Talent,1259971200,"12 5, 2009",2009,901,"['Margaret', 'Cho', 'abundance', 'energy', 'charisma', 'also', 'great', 'ability', 'tell', 'joke', 'proper', 'timing', 'shame', 'talents', 'telling', 'crude', 'sex', 'jokes', 'when', 'could', 'be', 'using', 'unique', 'position', 'world', 'comedy', 'Asian', 'American', 'woman', 'deliver', 'messages', 'substance', 'Clever', 'insights', 'American', 'daily', 'life', 'politics', 'feminism', 'would', 'catapult', 'career.The', 'depth', 'jokes', 'Beautiful', 'so', 'shallow', 'am', 'led', 'believe', 'Margaret', 'simply', 'ideas', 'should', 'hire', 'writers', 'have', 'fans', 'send', 'jokes', 'Beautiful', 'doing', 'same', 'old', 'shtick', 'telling', 'jokes', 'sexual', 'experiences', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'example', 'menstruation', 'How', 'long', 'can', 'keep', 'going', 'bit', 'abyss', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'think', 'still', 'time', 'turn', 'career', 'just', 'hope']",N/A

However it was really difficult for me to give 'Beautiful' five stars.  I wanted to give it 4.5, because it is funny and you will laugh but it seems too much of the material in this set was recycled and at times her delivery seemed off.'I'm The One That I Want,' 'Notorious C.H.O.,' 'Revolution,' and 'Assassin' are all side-splitting funny.

1275139,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B002KLQ31C,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[15, 17]","The excellent part of this live stand-up show is that Margaret Cho begins at full throttle, with the powerful political and sexual material she usually saves for the end.  The sad part is that this leaves her nowhere to go.  When she starts out full-bore, that makes her push to maintain that energy, and leaves her nothing to finish with.  Which probably explains her final show-stopper, a raunchy song that should earn a standing ovation, but just leaves me thinking: ""Wow, this goes on a bit, doesn't it?""Recorded in the run-up to the 2008 election, this show is half comedy and half call to action.  Of course, that's par for Margaret Cho's course.  If you've seen her before, little here will surprise you.  Cho's humor is based on seeing the world from a skewed angle, letting her point out truths that most of us miss.  And she doesn't let us down: every joke is up to her standards.  Every line will either make you laugh or offend you, and for the same reason, because she's telling the truth.But because she starts so high, the sustained energy smacks of desperation.  The jokes are individually great, but as a set, they struggle to hang together.  She screams for us to acknowledge her.  I got tired watching her.  And somewhere after the one-hour point, a switch flipped.  I could see that this was funny stuff, but I couldn't muster more than an occasional chuckle.  She just wiped me out.  More careful timing might have saved this show.  I love Margaret, but this show doesn't hang together.",3,"Great Jokes, but a Desperate Show",1275264000,"05 31, 2010",2010,1507,"['excellent', 'part', 'live', 'stand-up', 'show', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'full', 'throttle', 'powerful', 'political', 'sexual', 'material', 'usually', 'end', 'sad', 'part', 'nowhere', 'go', 'When', 'full-bore', 'push', 'maintain', 'energy', 'nothing', 'finish', 'Which', 'probably', 'final', 'show-stopper', 'raunchy', 'song', 'should', 'earn', 'standing', 'ovation', 'just', 'thinking', 'Wow', 'bit', ""n't"", 'Recorded', 'run-up', '2008', 'election', 'show', 'half', 'comedy', 'half', 'call', 'action', 'course', 'par', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'course', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'little', 'here', 'will', 'surprise', 'Cho', 'humor', 'based', 'seeing', 'world', 'skewed', 'angle', 'letting', 'point', 'out', 'truths', 'most', 'miss', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'joke', 'up', 'standards', 'line', 'will', 'either', 'make', 'offend', 'same', 'reason', 'telling', 'truth.But', 'so', 'high', 'sustained', 'energy', 'smacks', 'desperation', 'jokes', 'are', 'individually', 'great', 'set', 'struggle', 'hang', 'together', 'screams', 'acknowledge', 'got', 'tired', 'watching', 'somewhere', 'one-hour', 'point', 'switch', 'flipped', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'funny', 'stuff', 'could', ""n't"", 'muster', 'more', 'occasional', 'chuckle', 'just', 'wiped', 'out', 'More', 'careful', 'timing', 'might', 'have', 'saved', 'show', 'love', 'Margaret', 'show', ""n't"", 'hang', 'together']",N/A

1275142,A207SJRVTRGZQ9,B002KLQ31C,"Rac A. Powsky ""hello""","[4, 6]","Margaret Cho used to be edgy but now she's just ""edgy"". She thrives on the kind of stand up comedy that makes the audience go ""did she just say that?"" and that's really the most popular stand up around (just watchThe Aristocratsfor more examples) and there's nothing wrong with it but too often the jokes become tired and stale as the taboo has been trashed and destroyed already so its just flogging a dead horse.I remember once finding Cho hilarious and even though I foundMargaret Cho - Notorious C.H.O.to be overtly preachy, I still laughed. By contrast, this DVD is a long slog through the ego of a woman who has a devoted set of followers (the opening montage of her fans going to the show is so sycophantic that I thought I was going to end up watching a cult) and has no real need to challenge herself. Even though many artists can feel lucky to find a niche and are wise to stick with it (do you really want to see George Clooney playing the kind of parts that Mickey Rourke gets?) standup comedians should be always challenging themselves and their audiences, else they just turn stale.The ironic part about this show is just how transgressive it should be but is not. Her opening line about hating Sarah Palin would be shocking if it wasn't Margaret Cho speaking to a room full of hardcore leftwingers and liberals who have no love for Palin either. Her digs on John McCain were done better by Al Franken with a lot more warmth and class. Then she goes straight to the vagina jokes. The more shocking she tries to be the more it seems like pandering. She has found the key to making her core audience love her and since they will laugh at anything, why not just keep repeating the same standards? Even her jokes about gay people are falling into the ""lesbians wear Birkenstocks/gay men love Wizard of Oz"" stereotypes that weren't that funny in the 70s and are excruciating now.This is a boring show. I didn't laugh once. There were some mildly amusing bits about Lost and India but they were mostly just novelties in a show that trades humor for comfort and mistakes gross out humor for personal anecdotes (if there's no internal life in those sex jokes then they aren't personal - they are just gynecological lectures) and the ultimate ""message"" before the ""hilarious"" cunnilingus song is that everyone should think of themselves as beautiful. Thanks Margaret. Maybe next time you could skip the sermon and tell some jokes.",1,Its always sad when a once funny comedian turns stale,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,2435,"['Margaret', 'Cho', 'used', 'be', 'edgy', 'now', 'just', 'edgy', 'kind', 'stand', 'up', 'comedy', 'audience', 'go', 'did', 'just', 'say', 'really', 'most', 'popular', 'stand', 'up', 'around', 'just', 'watchThe', 'Aristocratsfor', 'more', 'examples', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'too', 'often', 'jokes', 'become', 'tired', 'stale', 'taboo', 'been', 'trashed', 'destroyed', 'already', 'so', 'just', 'flogging', 'dead', 'horse.I', 'remember', 'once', 'finding', 'Cho', 'hilarious', 'even', 'foundMargaret', 'Cho', 'Notorious', 'C.H.O.to', 'be', 'overtly', 'preachy', 'still', 'laughed', 'contrast', 'DVD', 'long', 'slog', 'ego', 'woman', 'who', 'devoted', 'set', 'followers', 'opening', 'montage', 'fans', 'going', 'show', 'so', 'sycophantic', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'watching', 'cult', 'real', 'need', 'challenge', 'Even', 'many', 'artists', 'can', 'feel', 'lucky', 'find', 'niche', 'are', 'wise', 'stick', 'do', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'George', 'Clooney', 'playing', 'kind', 'parts', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'standup', 'comedians', 'should', 'be', 'always', 'challenging', 'audiences', 'else', 'just', 'turn', 'stale.The', 'ironic', 'part', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'transgressive', 'should', 'be', 'not', 'opening', 'line', 'hating', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'would', 'be', 'shocking', 'was', ""n't"", 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'speaking', 'room', 'full', 'hardcore', 'leftwingers', 'liberals', 'who', 'have', 'love', 'Palin', 'either', 'digs', 'John', 'McCain', 'were', 'done', 'better', 'Al', 'Franken', 'lot', 'more', 'warmth', 'class', 'Then', 'straight', 'vagina', 'jokes', 'more', 'shocking', 'be', 'more', 'pandering', 'found', 'key', 'making', 'core', 'audience', 'love', 'will', 'laugh', 'anything', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'keep', 'repeating', 'same', 'standards', 'Even', 'jokes', 'gay', 'people', 'are', 'falling', 'lesbians', 'wear', 'Birkenstocks/gay', 'men', 'love', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'stereotypes', 'were', ""n't"", 'funny', '70s', 'are', 'excruciating', 'now.This', 'boring', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'once', 'were', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'bits', 'Lost', 'India', 'were', 'mostly', 'just', 'novelties', 'show', 'humor', 'comfort', 'mistakes', 'gross', 'out', 'humor', 'personal', 'anecdotes', 'internal', 'life', 'sex', 'jokes', 'then', 'are', ""n't"", 'personal', 'are', 'just', 'gynecological', 'lectures', 'ultimate', 'message', 'hilarious', 'cunnilingus', 'song', 'everyone', 'should', 'think', 'beautiful', 'Thanks', 'Margaret', 'Maybe', 'next', 'time', 'could', 'skip', 'sermon', 'tell', 'jokes']",N/A
