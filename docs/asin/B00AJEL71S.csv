1612252,AT3CTIPQ1682I,B00AJEL71S,DMDutcher,"[20, 21]","Far, far better than you think. Hana falls in love with the last remaining werewolf in Japan. They build a life together, and have two children until tragedy strikes. She flees with her two children, Yuki and Ame, and tries to live a quiet life in the rural countryside away from prying eyes. But raising two wolf children is harder than it seems.This is a spectacular, beautiful film. It's documenting the life of a special family, and each shot and situation is done with care and heart. I found far better than Summer Wars, the director's previous work, and this without big action sequences or garish CGI. The two wolf children are absolutely adorable, and watching them grow up and deal with their nature is both heartwarming and sad.I found the dub to be excellent. Young Yuki in particular was outstanding, but all the voices fit well and none grate. I'm often harsh on dubs, and prefer subs, but Funimation did a great job here. The Instant Video version was a great transfer even at SD, and the only minor issue I had was that on my setup, the music seemed a hair too loud compared to the SE. Considering that this sold for $10 when I purchased the SD version, it's an amazing value.If you love anime, this is a no-brainer. Even if you don't, it has none of the usual anime cliches, and feels more like a Disney movie if made for and targeting adults.

1612258,A3LRVGJ73EMPQV,B00AJEL71S,"Issac K. Ohnheiser ""Ohnine""","[5, 8]","The director of ""Summer Wars,"" and ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,"" has done it again with another masterpiece in story telling.  Mamoru Hosoda creates a world within our own, much like in his previous movies, and builds drama through character driven story.  It is amazing how much you truly care for these children and their bad-luck-stricken mother just minutes into the film.  Hosoda reaches into his bag of tricks and provides many scenes that create those slice of life moments that make you happy to be a human and mix it with the very real danger of losing your children.  I recommend this movie to anyone with a heart.Beyond the obvious and more into the structure of the movie I would say that this film's breathtaking and dramatic moments are only rivaled by its amazing tempo and screenplay.  Tempo can change a movie from action to feel good in moments and this movie does a great job with that.  If I were to tell you that this movie doesn't lack in the montage department you might be turned off immediately but I dare you to watch the segments of the film and think anything other than genius.  There were moments when I felt that the story was on autopilot, mostly because of a montage changing the time frame, only to be stopped dead in my tracks with tragedy, horror, or a feel good moment.  The films pace never slows or speeds up and that is a groundbreaking achievement to keep the interest of your audience with such a technique (Watch any Christopher Nolan film and you will know what I am talking about. Tempo never changes in his films and it works masterfully).Finally I will say that one day this film will make it into the American market and some actors will dub over the voices with their in-equivalent ability and ruin the movie.  Watch this in Japanese with the subtitles, you will not be disappointed.  If you are thinking to yourself,  ""who would ever want to read that much,"" remember you have probably been reading for almost two decades or more and it shouldn't be considered a chore.",5,What a Masterpiece,1367452800,"05 2, 2013",2013,2024,"['director', 'Summer', 'Wars', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Leapt', 'Time', 'done', 'again', 'masterpiece', 'story', 'telling', 'Mamoru', 'Hosoda', 'world', 'own', 'much', 'previous', 'movies', 'builds', 'drama', 'character', 'driven', 'story', 'amazing', 'how', 'much', 'truly', 'care', 'children', 'bad-luck-stricken', 'mother', 'just', 'minutes', 'film', 'Hosoda', 'bag', 'tricks', 'many', 'scenes', 'create', 'slice', 'life', 'moments', 'make', 'happy', 'be', 'human', 'mix', 'very', 'real', 'danger', 'losing', 'children', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'heart.Beyond', 'obvious', 'more', 'structure', 'movie', 'would', 'say', 'film', 'breathtaking', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'are', 'only', 'rivaled', 'amazing', 'tempo', 'screenplay', 'Tempo', 'can', 'change', 'movie', 'action', 'feel', 'good', 'moments', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'were', 'tell', 'movie', ""n't"", 'lack', 'montage', 'department', 'might', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'immediately', 'dare', 'watch', 'segments', 'film', 'think', 'anything', 'other', 'genius', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'felt', 'story', 'was', 'autopilot', 'mostly', 'montage', 'changing', 'time', 'frame', 'only', 'be', 'stopped', 'dead', 'tracks', 'tragedy', 'horror', 'feel', 'good', 'moment', 'films', 'pace', 'never', 'up', 'groundbreaking', 'achievement', 'keep', 'interest', 'audience', 'technique', 'Watch', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'film', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'Tempo', 'never', 'films', 'masterfully', '.Finally', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'day', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'American', 'market', 'actors', 'will', 'dub', 'voices', 'in-equivalent', 'ability', 'ruin', 'movie', 'Watch', 'Japanese', 'subtitles', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'are', 'thinking', 'yourself', 'who', 'would', 'ever', 'want', 'read', 'much', 'remember', 'have', 'probably', 'been', 'reading', 'almost', 'two', 'decades', 'more', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'considered', 'chore']",Ookami Kodomo No Ame To Yuki - Family Package Ban (BD+DVD+BOOKLET) [Japan LTD BD] VPXT-71243

The story is one that everyone can relate to in some form or another in the fact that we all have to choose our own paths and that people can be cruel and gentle all at the same time. I would recommend this even for non-anime fans. There is one scene that could be interpreted as bestiality or furrie erotica but nothing is shown it is simply implied and in no way sexualizes the characters. The point is to show complete acceptance of another. I am Catholic as is my family so this brief scenen was startling but nothing to warrant a flag and something my family and I discussed after the film was over. My parents never liked anime, but after seeing this film, they grew more accepting.

1612293,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00AJEL71S,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","&#34;Wolf Children&#34;, a Japanese animated feature directed by Mamoru Hosoda, is one of those films that captivate one's imagination and tug at one's heartstrings all at the same time. It certainly had me watching it several times over in the week that I had it on loan from the library (and I plan on purchasing it for my collection). I watched it with my nine--year-old daughter who loves all of Miyazaki's feature films and is beginning to develop a love of quality Japanese and even Korean anime (well, at least those that are suitable for her age group). &#34;Wolf Children&#34; is a perfect blend of folklore, character development, quality animation, and a wonderful score.The story begins with a female voice narrating the story of her mother Hana's life. Hana, a young university student at the International University in Tokyo, falls in love with a mysterious young man who after a while reveals himself to be a Wolf Man, the last descendant of a line that can transform into wolves. The couple share an idyllic life for several years, and grow their family with the birth of a girl named Yuki and a boy named Ame. Tragedy forces Hana to move to the countryside where she struggles to raise her two young children, who have inherited their father's ability to transform into a wolf.The themes of familial love, of being at one with nature and living off the land, as well as the ever present struggle between two different worlds, i.e. the world of man vs. the world of the wild, is beautifully explored in this film. The scenic setting of the Japanese countryside with its cascading waterfalls, the beautiful wintry landscape etc. make this one of the most beautiful animated features I've seen. The plot is compelling and Hana is a strong yet sympathetic figure, trying her best to be a good mother even though she is assailed by doubts as to how to raise two wolf children. The children, Yuki and Ame are well-delineated: Yuki plays the fiery older sibling whose wolf side is very much evident when she is little but who matures into a beautiful young woman more at ease with her human self; conversely, Ame is a timid boy who shies away from his wolf self as a child, but develops a strong connection to nature as he matures and feels his wolf side getting stronger as the years pass. This dichotomy between the world of man and the world of animals and nature is explored in a manner that is easy to comprehend, even for a nine-year-old.  The score for this film is amazing, with music that soothes and inspires, including a Japanese lullaby that is haunting to listen to.I highly recommend this for fans of quality storytelling. The English dialogue never distracts nor is it jarring; in fact, it blends in beautifully, making me forget that this was originally in Japanese. I hope to check out Hosoda's other offerings.",5,Amazing animated feature with a folktale-inspired plot,1396742400,"04 6, 2014",2014,2839,"['34', 'Wolf', 'Children', '34', 'Japanese', 'animated', 'feature', 'directed', 'Mamoru', 'Hosoda', 'one', 'films', 'captivate', 'one', 'imagination', 'tug', 'one', 'heartstrings', 'same', 'time', 'certainly', 'had', 'watching', 'several', 'times', 'week', 'had', 'loan', 'library', 'plan', 'purchasing', 'collection', 'watched', 'nine', 'year-old', 'daughter', 'who', 'Miyazaki', 'feature', 'films', 'beginning', 'develop', 'love', 'quality', 'Japanese', 'even', 'Korean', 'anime', 'well', 'least', 'are', 'suitable', 'age', 'group', '34', 'Wolf', 'Children', '34', 'perfect', 'blend', 'folklore', 'character', 'development', 'quality', 'animation', 'wonderful', 'score.The', 'story', 'female', 'voice', 'narrating', 'story', 'mother', 'Hana', 'life', 'Hana', 'young', 'university', 'student', 'International', 'University', 'Tokyo', 'love', 'mysterious', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'while', 'be', 'Wolf', 'Man', 'last', 'descendant', 'line', 'can', 'transform', 'wolves', 'couple', 'share', 'idyllic', 'life', 'several', 'years', 'grow', 'family', 'birth', 'girl', 'named', 'Yuki', 'boy', 'named', 'Ame', 'Tragedy', 'forces', 'Hana', 'move', 'countryside', 'where', 'raise', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'inherited', 'father', 'ability', 'transform', 'wolf.The', 'themes', 'familial', 'love', 'being', 'one', 'nature', 'living', 'off', 'land', 'as', 'well', 'ever', 'present', 'struggle', 'two', 'different', 'worlds', 'i.e', 'world', 'man', 'world', 'wild', 'beautifully', 'explored', 'film', 'scenic', 'setting', 'Japanese', 'countryside', 'cascading', 'waterfalls', 'beautiful', 'wintry', 'landscape', 'etc', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'animated', 'features', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plot', 'compelling', 'Hana', 'strong', 'yet', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'trying', 'best', 'be', 'good', 'mother', 'even', 'assailed', 'doubts', 'how', 'raise', 'two', 'wolf', 'children', 'children', 'Yuki', 'Ame', 'are', 'well-delineated', 'Yuki', 'fiery', 'older', 'sibling', 'wolf', 'side', 'very', 'much', 'evident', 'when', 'little', 'who', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'more', 'ease', 'human', 'self', 'conversely', 'Ame', 'timid', 'boy', 'who', 'away', 'wolf', 'self', 'child', 'strong', 'connection', 'nature', 'wolf', 'side', 'getting', 'stronger', 'years', 'pass', 'dichotomy', 'world', 'man', 'world', 'animals', 'nature', 'explored', 'manner', 'easy', 'comprehend', 'even', 'nine-year-old', 'score', 'film', 'amazing', 'music', 'inspires', 'including', 'Japanese', 'lullaby', 'haunting', 'listen', 'to.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'quality', 'storytelling', 'English', 'dialogue', 'never', 'distracts', 'jarring', 'fact', 'beautifully', 'making', 'forget', 'was', 'originally', 'Japanese', 'hope', 'check', 'out', 'Hosoda', 'other', 'offerings']",Ookami Kodomo No Ame To Yuki - Family Package Ban (BD+DVD+BOOKLET) [Japan LTD BD] VPXT-71243
