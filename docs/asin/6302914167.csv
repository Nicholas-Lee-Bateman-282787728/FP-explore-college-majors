Simon,"[2, 3]","This was a TV miniseries revolving around Albert Speer's being slowly captivated by Hitler before the latter seized power and after he became Chancellor. What makes this particular work so unique is that it doesn't fall into the trap of making a caricature out of Hitler, as endless films have done. Rather, it shows the dictator in such a way that you understand why such an otherwise intelligent man as Speer could become mesmerized by him.",5,Fascinating,1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,442,"['was', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'revolving', 'Albert', 'Speer', 'being', 'slowly', 'captivated', 'Hitler', 'latter', 'seized', 'power', 'became', 'Chancellor', 'What', 'particular', 'work', 'so', 'unique', ""n't"", 'fall', 'trap', 'making', 'caricature', 'Hitler', 'endless', 'films', 'have', 'done', 'Rather', 'dictator', 'such', 'way', 'understand', 'why', 'otherwise', 'intelligent', 'man', 'Speer', 'could', 'become', 'mesmerized']",N/A

345160,A36CB1ZVCBDYOA,6302914167,Fritz Von Steiger,"[2, 3]","Good movie and I greatly enjoyed it and happy to have in my collection.  A young Rutger Hauer adds to the movie. The only draw back to the movie was the whiners in the film, his wife, father, and his Architect teacher. Hitler is chancellor and providing jobs for the German people, and raising the spirits and pride of all Germany. With all this positive energy, you have a foreboding wife who moans,  groans, and whimpers about Speer's decision to serve the horrible Third Reich, regardless of all Germany happiness.  You have a Architect teacher who moans, groans, and aggressively angered of his young students choice to serve the third Reich and becomes very vindictive to his student (Speer).  His father is regretful his son has made this decision and has a negative sense of foreboding. The family in this movie and his teacher made me what to yell out OH SHUT THE H@LL UP.  This was clearly propaganda to once again put the German Third Reich in a bad light, regardless of all Hitler's accomplishments and productiveness of the 1930's.  There was considerable positive productiveness accomplished by Hitler before World War II, contrary to his family s moans, groans, and whimpers. I also did not like the part of Randy Quaid playing the drunken buffoon. So I gave it four stars because of his melancholy family, teacher and the buffoon Randy Quaid. His mother though was a loyal party member.",4,THIRD REICH ON THE MOVE,1296345600,"01 30, 2011",2011,1401,"['Good', 'movie', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'happy', 'have', 'collection', 'young', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'movie', 'only', 'draw', 'back', 'movie', 'was', 'whiners', 'film', 'wife', 'father', 'Architect', 'teacher', 'Hitler', 'chancellor', 'providing', 'jobs', 'German', 'people', 'raising', 'spirits', 'pride', 'Germany', 'positive', 'energy', 'have', 'foreboding', 'wife', 'who', 'groans', 'whimpers', 'Speer', 'decision', 'serve', 'horrible', 'Third', 'Reich', 'regardless', 'Germany', 'happiness', 'have', 'Architect', 'teacher', 'who', 'groans', 'aggressively', 'angered', 'young', 'students', 'choice', 'serve', 'third', 'Reich', 'very', 'vindictive', 'student', 'Speer', 'father', 'regretful', 'son', 'made', 'decision', 'negative', 'sense', 'foreboding', 'family', 'movie', 'teacher', 'made', 'what', 'yell', 'out', 'OH', 'SHUT', 'THE', 'H', '@', 'LL', 'UP', 'was', 'clearly', 'propaganda', 'once', 'again', 'put', 'German', 'Third', 'Reich', 'bad', 'light', 'regardless', 'Hitler', 'accomplishments', 'productiveness', '1930', 'was', 'considerable', 'positive', 'productiveness', 'accomplished', 'Hitler', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'contrary', 'family', 's', 'moans', 'groans', 'whimpers', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'part', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'playing', 'drunken', 'buffoon', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'melancholy', 'family', 'teacher', 'buffoon', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'mother', 'was', 'loyal', 'party', 'member']",N/A

345162,A2ZNJKY01ANDHG,6302914167,"John A. Kuczma ""RogueUlfric""","[35, 37]","Inside the Third Reich purports to give the viewer a behind the scenes look at the inner dealings of Hitler's Nazi Party.  In many respects, it accomplishes this purpose admirably, but in many others, it must be  carefully weighed against other, more objective, sources.Rutger Hauer  does a commendable job of portraying Albert Speer, Hitler's chief architect  and one of the very few Nazi operatives to successfully stand up to the  Fuhrer.  He provides an excellent vehicle for depicting the petty but often  deadly jealosies that abounded within the Nazi inner circle, particularly  well done as relates to Martin Bormann and Josef Goebbels.Unfortunately,  the film attempts to all but whitewash Speer who, although not a major  player in many of the Reich's more notorious excesses, was nonetheless  directly involved, far more than revisionist historians wish to have  believed.Be that as is may, the movie itself is excellent.  The tone  is somber and studious, taking a near documentary approach in many of its  historical depictions.  Care is taken to allow many of the peripheral  characters to develop into fully involved human beings whom the viewer can  identify with, rather than mere statistics.  Strangely, however, this  careful approach does not extent to the major Nazi figures, particularly  Himmler and Bormann, who come off as near caricatures rather than  people.The story follows historical reality quite closely, achieving a  conclusion that is both unsettling and emotionally confused, a remarkably  accurate portrayal of the state of the German people at the conclusion of  hostilities.Derek Jacobi gives a powerful and surprisingly human  performance as Hitler, often refreshingly understated and only occasionally  reverting to the histrionics by which the dictator is frequently  stereotyped.This production is far from perfect, but it does give the  viewer a disturbing glimpse at the internal function of the Nazi decision  making process.  Whether viewed for its historical significance or simply  as a very good piece of drama, Inside the Third Reich will not disappoint.",4,Solid Representation of the Inner Workings of Hitler's Reich,957139200,"05 1, 2000",2000,2104,"['Third', 'Reich', 'give', 'viewer', 'scenes', 'look', 'inner', 'dealings', 'Hitler', 'Nazi', 'Party', 'many', 'respects', 'purpose', 'admirably', 'many', 'others', 'must', 'be', 'carefully', 'weighed', 'other', 'more', 'objective', 'sources.Rutger', 'Hauer', 'commendable', 'job', 'portraying', 'Albert', 'Speer', 'Hitler', 'chief', 'architect', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'Nazi', 'operatives', 'successfully', 'stand', 'up', 'Fuhrer', 'excellent', 'vehicle', 'depicting', 'petty', 'often', 'deadly', 'jealosies', 'abounded', 'Nazi', 'inner', 'circle', 'particularly', 'well', 'done', 'relates', 'Martin', 'Bormann', 'Josef', 'Goebbels.Unfortunately', 'film', 'attempts', 'whitewash', 'Speer', 'who', 'not', 'major', 'player', 'many', 'Reich', 'more', 'notorious', 'excesses', 'was', 'nonetheless', 'directly', 'involved', 'far', 'more', 'revisionist', 'historians', 'wish', 'have', 'believed.Be', 'may', 'movie', 'excellent', 'tone', 'somber', 'studious', 'taking', 'near', 'documentary', 'approach', 'many', 'historical', 'depictions', 'Care', 'taken', 'allow', 'many', 'peripheral', 'characters', 'develop', 'fully', 'involved', 'human', 'beings', 'whom', 'viewer', 'can', 'identify', 'rather', 'mere', 'statistics', 'Strangely', 'however', 'careful', 'approach', 'not', 'extent', 'major', 'Nazi', 'figures', 'particularly', 'Himmler', 'Bormann', 'who', 'come', 'off', 'near', 'caricatures', 'rather', 'people.The', 'story', 'historical', 'reality', 'quite', 'closely', 'achieving', 'conclusion', 'unsettling', 'emotionally', 'confused', 'remarkably', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'state', 'German', 'people', 'conclusion', 'hostilities.Derek', 'Jacobi', 'powerful', 'surprisingly', 'human', 'performance', 'Hitler', 'often', 'refreshingly', 'understated', 'only', 'occasionally', 'reverting', 'histrionics', 'dictator', 'frequently', 'stereotyped.This', 'production', 'far', 'perfect', 'give', 'viewer', 'disturbing', 'glimpse', 'internal', 'function', 'Nazi', 'decision', 'making', 'process', 'viewed', 'historical', 'significance', 'simply', 'very', 'good', 'piece', 'drama', 'Third', 'Reich', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint']",N/A

345164,AWU4OE1QMKZAR,6302914167,Taizu,"[1, 1]",This excellent series was first telecasted in Singapore and Malaysia in the early eighties and I can still recall how impressed I was with the production and how it inspired me (who until then had no interest in World War 2 History) to start researching into WW2 and even to borrow and read Speer's book. I was only 9 at the time.Everytime this series was repeated I'd watch it and even videotaped and watched the recorded series repeatedly until the tapes wore out.Is there anyone else lobbying for a dvd release? Am unable to understand why this is taking so long given the great reviews seen here and elsewhere of this great mini series of the eighties.Please please whatever the powers that be with rights to this series to release it on dvd with English subtitles (as I have friends and family who are hard of hearing) and hopefully with dvd extras that deal with the making of the series and cast interviews. I understand there are deleted scenes which I hope the dvd release will restore and add to the original run time.Anyway am awaiting the dvd release!!!!!!!!,5,Great Series!!!
