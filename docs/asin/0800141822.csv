165420,A2H22I2RWE0HOV,0800141822,,"[3, 4]","When Robert De Niro is on, he's on!  When he jumps into character, he lives the part without looking back.  That's what makes De Niro such a great actor.  He usually takes his work very seriously (Bullwinkle would be one of the exceptions)and makes us believe, good or bad, in what he's doing.  When he plays Gil Renard, divorced hunting knife salesman, avid Rolling Stones fan and SF Giants' Baseball freak, the message is a little muddled.  The Giants have picked up baseball superstar Bobby Raybun (Snipes) for some outrageous amount of money (Sound familiar?) and Gil is tickled pink.  Rayburn is going to put the Giants on top and win them a World Series title.  Well...things don't always work out that way.  Rayburn doesn't get his lucky number 11.  He screws up his ribs.  The pressure of his huge contract is weighing him dow because the fans expect results and they're not afraid to tell him that at each game.  Can we all say SLUMP! Gil, on the other hand, is having troubles of his own.  His job is moving on without him.  His relationship with his son is a strained and creepy mess of custody battle proportions.  His ex-wife has put a restraining order on him.  And Bobby Rayburn, the 40 Million Dollar Kid,  sucks! Focusing not on the other things in his life that need fixing, baeball needs Gil's full, obssessive attention.  He needs to help Rayburn out of his slump, right?  Well....what if he kills off the outfielder who refused to give up the number 11?  Things deteriorate from there as Renard's madness take over.A mixed, creepy movie.  I could not feel any pity for De Niro's charcter & he needed that to be truly effective.  Otherwise, he just comes off as some looney assh*le baseball freak who blames his own problems on the game.  The storylne is loose and clumsy.  The characters are middle of the road.  Somewhere along the line, De Niro picks parts that make no sense.  When he plays the bad guy or the psycho, he's pretty effective, but here the performance is mired in bad writing.  I couldn't wait for Gil Renard to die and that's not a good thing, even though I knew it was going to happen.  Very predictable. Not one of De Niro's better outings.  Snipes was decent as was Benicio Del Toro.  Like Cape Fear, not a De Niro flick I'd want to watch again for a long, long while.Deal with it!",2,De Niro Swings For The Seats & Catches Nothing But Air,1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,2323,"['When', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'When', 'character', 'part', 'looking', 'back', 'what', 'De', 'Niro', 'great', 'actor', 'usually', 'work', 'very', 'seriously', 'Bullwinkle', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'exceptions', 'believe', 'good', 'bad', 'what', 'doing', 'When', 'Gil', 'Renard', 'divorced', 'hunting', 'knife', 'salesman', 'avid', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'fan', 'SF', 'Giants', 'Baseball', 'freak', 'message', 'little', 'muddled', 'Giants', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'baseball', 'superstar', 'Bobby', 'Raybun', 'Snipes', 'outrageous', 'amount', 'money', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'Gil', 'tickled', 'pink', 'Rayburn', 'going', 'put', 'Giants', 'top', 'win', 'World', 'Series', 'title', 'Well', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'out', 'way', 'Rayburn', ""n't"", 'get', 'lucky', 'number', '11', 'up', 'ribs', 'pressure', 'huge', 'contract', 'weighing', 'dow', 'fans', 'expect', 'results', ""'re"", 'not', 'afraid', 'tell', 'game', 'Can', 'say', 'SLUMP', 'Gil', 'other', 'hand', 'having', 'troubles', 'own', 'job', 'moving', 'relationship', 'son', 'strained', 'creepy', 'mess', 'custody', 'battle', 'proportions', 'ex-wife', 'put', 'restraining', 'order', 'Bobby', 'Rayburn', '40', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Kid', 'Focusing', 'not', 'other', 'things', 'life', 'need', 'fixing', 'baeball', 'Gil', 'full', 'obssessive', 'attention', 'help', 'Rayburn', 'slump', 'right', 'Well', '.what', 'outfielder', 'who', 'refused', 'give', 'up', 'number', '11', 'Things', 'deteriorate', 'there', 'Renard', 'madness', 'take', 'over.A', 'mixed', 'creepy', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'feel', 'pity', 'De', 'Niro', 'charcter', 'needed', 'be', 'truly', 'effective', 'Otherwise', 'just', 'off', 'looney', 'baseball', 'freak', 'who', 'own', 'problems', 'game', 'storylne', 'loose', 'clumsy', 'characters', 'are', 'middle', 'road', 'Somewhere', 'line', 'De', 'Niro', 'parts', 'make', 'sense', 'When', 'bad', 'guy', 'psycho', 'pretty', 'effective', 'here', 'performance', 'mired', 'bad', 'writing', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Gil', 'Renard', 'die', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'even', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'Very', 'predictable', 'Not', 'one', 'De', 'Niro', 'better', 'outings', 'Snipes', 'was', 'decent', 'was', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'not', 'De', 'Niro', 'flick', ""'d"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'long', 'long', 'while.Deal']",N/A

165423,A2582KMXLK2P06,0800141822,B. E Jackson,"[3, 5]","The Fan is one of my favorite Robert De Niro films.  Seriously, I used to hate the man and believed he was totally overrated but ever since I became more open-minded towards movies in general I've changed my ways drastically.  This is yet another quality movie with fantastic storytelling that left me wanting more.  Alright so the actual plot took forever to get going.  I'm tempted to take away one star for that fact alone (but I won't since the second half of the film surprised me by blowing me completely away).What's funny is that when I first read the description I actually thought it was that recent film about the New York Giants fan who's incredibly rude and immature.  Then I noticed this movie came out in 1996 and realized there's no way it's the same movie.  Interesting similarities though, but it's obvious this film is better made overall.  The other one feels low budget in comparison with more emphasis on straight up rudeness.Robert De Niro plays the part of an obsessed fan of the San Francisco Giants.  He's incredibly obnoxious while at the ballpark.  He's the kind of guy that all the fans sitting around him constantly yell to sit down and shut up RIGHT NOW and then prompt to cuss him out, haha!  Despite this unwelcoming attitude of his, he takes his son to the games anyway and makes a total you-know-what of himself as his son is left sitting in the seats totally confused by his fathers behavior, and the people around him just want to knock his lights out.  It's actually funny but in reality, no, these type of people are terrible!Later on it's discovered that Robert has much MUCH bigger issues besides being incredibly rude towards his favorite team.  Without spoiling what he's actually like, well let's just say being obsessed is just *part* of De Niro's problem!  The guy is completely nuts!  One of the players in particular he totally obsesses over.  Eventually they cross paths in a really strange and interesting way.  I'll leave it at that!Great acting, and despite a slow and confusing plotline in the beginning (because everything feels rushed and disjointed until you give it time and patience to develop) I eventually fell in love with the Fan.

Wesley Snipes has Also played this role before, but unlike De Niro, he gives one of his Best performances as the Hero who has to battle through a Slump in his career, Team-mates that Can't Stand him, Crowds and Commentators Turning on him and an Obsessed Fan, to boot.They are both Well Baked up by an Exceptional Supporting cast.

165426,A5DIAZ5GT3MC,0800141822,Crazy Jim,"[0, 0]","Tony Scott who has often been dismissed as the director of big, loud, and brainless action fodder like Top Gun and Enemy Of The State has never been one of the more respected directors in the industry. Despite his work on the excellent but highly-underrated &quot;True Romance&quot;, Scott is not a household name in too many areas. With &quot;The Fan&quot;, this so-called &quot;textbook&quot; action director tries his hand at a psychological thriller with a baseball theme.Robert DeNiro is Gil Renard, a down-on-his-luck knife salesman from San Fransisco who sees his dreams lived out on the baseball field in newly-signed Giants center-fielder, Bobby Rayburn (Snipes). But when Rayburn, himself, hits a bad patch, Gil will do whatever it takes to get his hero back to hitting again. When Gil's &quot;loyalty&quot; is not rewarded, he abducts Bobby's son and demands that Bobby hit in a homerun in his honor... or else!!!&quot;The Fan&quot; is a tense and uncomfortable film. DeNiro's Reynard is not presented so much as some sort of treacherous jerk as he is a guy who really got the short end of the stick. You almost want to cheer for him until he goes and takes it to the ultimate extreme. We want him to turn his life around but he is so caught up in his own world. Once he reaches that point of no return, we as an audience know that we have lost him. He's that fed-up sports fan inside all of us. While this performance is somewhat &quot;old hat&quot; for DeNiro (you can't help but notice a little bit of Travis Bickle here), he does it so well. Snipes is also effective as the objective of DeNiro's affection. Rayburn has his moments of cockiness and we often find ourselves relating more to Renard's struggle than that of Rayburn's. Snipes is comfortable in this performance as he is very much on-point. Supporting players Ellen Barkin and John Leguizamo while not given a whole lot to do, are a nice touch.&quot;The Fan&quot; is not an excellent movie. The script, while not totally unoriginal, is familiar. It does, however, provide a nice playing field for our two stars to do what they do best. Snipes gets to shine as the cocky athlete with the occasional moments of sympathetic self-worth thrown in while DeNiro gets to play the obsessed but misunderstood loner just looking for acceptance and appreciation for his sacrifices. Hans Zimmer's dark score is without question, the highlight of this film. It really compliments DeNiro's character very well. This is not to take anything away from Tony Scott either who really packs an emotional homerun.",4,Review of THE FAN!,1061424000,"08 21, 2003",2003,2567,"['Tony', 'Scott', 'who', 'often', 'been', 'dismissed', 'director', 'big', 'loud', 'brainless', 'action', 'fodder', 'Top', 'Gun', 'Enemy', 'State', 'never', 'been', 'one', 'more', 'respected', 'directors', 'industry', 'work', 'excellent', 'highly-underrated', 'quot', 'True', 'Romance', 'quot', 'Scott', 'not', 'household', 'name', 'too', 'many', 'areas', 'quot', 'Fan', 'quot', 'so-called', 'quot', 'quot', 'action', 'director', 'hand', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'baseball', 'theme.Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Gil', 'Renard', 'down-on-his-luck', 'knife', 'salesman', 'San', 'Fransisco', 'who', 'dreams', 'lived', 'out', 'baseball', 'field', 'newly-signed', 'Giants', 'center-fielder', 'Bobby', 'Rayburn', 'Snipes', 'when', 'Rayburn', 'bad', 'patch', 'Gil', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'get', 'hero', 'back', 'hitting', 'again', 'When', 'Gil', 'quot', 'loyalty', 'quot', 'not', 'rewarded', 'Bobby', 'son', 'demands', 'Bobby', 'hit', 'homerun', 'honor', 'else', 'quot', 'Fan', 'quot', 'tense', 'uncomfortable', 'film', 'DeNiro', 'Reynard', 'not', 'presented', 'so', 'much', 'sort', 'treacherous', 'jerk', 'guy', 'who', 'really', 'got', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'almost', 'want', 'cheer', 'ultimate', 'extreme', 'want', 'turn', 'life', 'around', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'own', 'world', 'point', 'return', 'audience', 'know', 'have', 'lost', 'fed-up', 'sports', 'fan', 'performance', 'somewhat', 'quot', 'old', 'hat', 'quot', 'DeNiro', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'little', 'bit', 'Travis', 'Bickle', 'here', 'so', 'well', 'Snipes', 'also', 'effective', 'objective', 'DeNiro', 'affection', 'Rayburn', 'moments', 'cockiness', 'often', 'find', 'relating', 'more', 'Renard', 'struggle', 'Rayburn', 'Snipes', 'comfortable', 'performance', 'very', 'much', 'on-point', 'Supporting', 'players', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'not', 'given', 'whole', 'lot', 'do', 'are', 'nice', 'touch.', 'quot', 'Fan', 'quot', 'not', 'excellent', 'movie', 'script', 'not', 'totally', 'unoriginal', 'familiar', 'however', 'provide', 'nice', 'playing', 'field', 'two', 'stars', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'Snipes', 'shine', 'cocky', 'athlete', 'occasional', 'moments', 'sympathetic', 'self-worth', 'thrown', 'DeNiro', 'play', 'obsessed', 'misunderstood', 'loner', 'just', 'looking', 'acceptance', 'appreciation', 'sacrifices', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'dark', 'score', 'question', 'highlight', 'film', 'really', 'DeNiro', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'not', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'who', 'really', 'emotional', 'homerun']",N/A

But he does not want to fall alone and he tries to take his baseball star down with him. You will never know why he goes through this bad period. Some will say his old deception that got him out of baseball a long time ago. Some will say it is his midlife crisis after a bad divorce and when professionally he is losing interest and ground and falling flat on his unemployed face. Some will say that he is also motivated by some crooked racist ideas who make him hate a Mexican player who stands in the way of his black star. Many other reasons could be invoked but probably all and each one of them in vain. There is in him something more psychopathic than just circumstancial. There is in him the will and the tension of someone who wants to be on top without paying the price for the passage, without making the effort of climbing up to it. He seems to believe the world owes him that recognition and that promotion. Then the rest is nothing but good and bad means to reach his aim, to force people and society to satisfy his demands.

165440,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0800141822,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","Robert De Niro playing a character out of his mind is still something to see, as this 1996 film amply proves.  This time around he plays Gil Renard, who sells just about every type of knife under the sun in the San Francisco Bay area, but not as well as he did in former days.  Divorced, his wife is giving him one last chance with his son, Richie (Andrew J. Ferchland).  Gil wants to take the boy to opening day at Candlestick Park, but he has also been given an ultimatum by his boss and he has a key appointment that same afternoon.  Of course, Gil blows both opportunities and all he has left in the world is his love of baseball in general and the Giants new $40 million centerfielder, Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes).  Gil even calls up the radio sports talk show of the emasculating Jewel Stern (Ellen Barkin) to talk to Bobby and praise him to high heavens.However, Bobby gets off to a very bad start with the Giants.  As the new big gun in town he has displaced the teams centerfielder Juan Primo (Benicio Del Toro).  In the first game neither backs off on a fly ball and they collide.  Bobby is hurt, but refuses to leave the game.  To add insult to injury, Juan wears number 11, which has always been Bobby's number, and Primo refuses to give it up.  Freaked by a visit to a young boy in a hospital who is not only dying but has the same name as his son, Bobby had promised to hit a home run and is feeling the pressure of that obligation.  The result is that while Primo plays like an All-Star, Bobby's average dips below the Mendoza line and becomes the constant target of the local media.  The only friend he has town might just be Gil.Without a job and under a restraining order to stay away from his son, Gil has nothing else to do but go to the ballpark and follow Bobby around town.  When he learns that Bobby wants to wear number 11, Gil decides that maybe there is something he can do about that.  Actually, nobody wears 11 for the Giants because the number was retired for the Hall of Fame screwball pitcher Carl Hubbell, but this movie has less to do with the real world as it goes merrily along.  What matters is that Gil feels that he has helped Bobby, who is back to his All-Star form, and is rather upset that his efforts have gone without notice.  As he says, ""A simple thank you would have been nice.""  At that point we know that something very, very bad is going to happen to Bobby.The film's climax, of course, takes place at a baseball game with Bobby having to hit a home run in an at bat under more pressure than anybody else in the history of the game.  Casey at the bat?  Meaningless.  Bobby Thompson in the 1951 National League Playoffs?  Nothing.  Roy Hobbs trying to hit one out for his son in ""The Natural"" is close to the mark, but Roy did not have to do it in the pouring rain and if he struck out his son was only going to be disappointed and not killed.  Besides the complete downpour he also has to hit off the pitcher while the jumbo-tron shows the pitcher pitching.  Now, major league baseball stadiums do not show live pictures while there is any action on the field, but that is why the end of ""The Fan"" is where the story is abandoned in favor of a big cinematic finish.The early part of the film, as Gil descends into madness and Bobby's batting average takes a nosedive, is the most interesting part of ""The Fan,"" because at that point it is primarily a case of parallel character studies.  There is a sense in which the character played by Snipes is actually more interesting than De Niro's because we get some insights into the peculiar psychoses of a major league baseball player.  At the end of the film we are surprised to learn that what distinguishes the two men most of all is their very different explanations for why Bobby has started hitting.However, in the end the psychology gives way to the action in a scene that scene that uncomfortably reminds us of the climax of ""The Naked Gun.""  It is impossible to accuse either star of going over the top in this film because ""The Fan"" does that all by itself at the end.  Given the character foundations that were established in the first parts of the film, this is one instance where less at the end would have been more.",4,A baseball thriller than does not go the whole nine innings,1053129600,"05 17, 2003",2003,4227,"['Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'playing', 'character', 'mind', 'still', 'something', 'see', '1996', 'film', 'amply', 'time', 'Gil', 'Renard', 'who', 'just', 'about', 'type', 'knife', 'sun', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bay', 'area', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'former', 'days', 'Divorced', 'wife', 'giving', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'son', 'Richie', 'Andrew', 'J.', 'Ferchland', 'Gil', 'take', 'boy', 'opening', 'day', 'Candlestick', 'Park', 'also', 'been', 'given', 'ultimatum', 'boss', 'key', 'appointment', 'same', 'afternoon', 'course', 'Gil', 'opportunities', 'left', 'world', 'love', 'baseball', 'general', 'Giants', 'new', '40', 'million', 'centerfielder', 'Bobby', 'Rayburn', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Gil', 'even', 'up', 'radio', 'sports', 'talk', 'show', 'emasculating', 'Jewel', 'Stern', 'Ellen', 'Barkin', 'talk', 'Bobby', 'praise', 'high', 'heavens.However', 'Bobby', 'off', 'very', 'bad', 'start', 'Giants', 'new', 'big', 'gun', 'town', 'displaced', 'teams', 'centerfielder', 'Juan', 'Primo', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'first', 'game', 'backs', 'off', 'fly', 'ball', 'collide', 'Bobby', 'hurt', 'leave', 'game', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'Juan', 'number', '11', 'always', 'been', 'Bobby', 'number', 'Primo', 'give', 'up', 'Freaked', 'visit', 'young', 'boy', 'hospital', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'dying', 'same', 'name', 'son', 'Bobby', 'had', 'promised', 'hit', 'home', 'run', 'feeling', 'pressure', 'obligation', 'result', 'Primo', 'All-Star', 'Bobby', 'average', 'dips', 'Mendoza', 'line', 'constant', 'target', 'local', 'media', 'only', 'friend', 'town', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'Gil.Without', 'job', 'restraining', 'order', 'stay', 'away', 'son', 'Gil', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'go', 'ballpark', 'follow', 'Bobby', 'town', 'When', 'Bobby', 'wear', 'number', '11', 'Gil', 'maybe', 'something', 'can', 'do', 'Actually', 'nobody', '11', 'Giants', 'number', 'was', 'retired', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'screwball', 'pitcher', 'Carl', 'Hubbell', 'movie', 'less', 'do', 'real', 'world', 'merrily', 'along', 'What', 'Gil', 'feels', 'helped', 'Bobby', 'who', 'back', 'All-Star', 'form', 'rather', 'upset', 'efforts', 'have', 'gone', 'notice', 'simple', 'thank', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'point', 'know', 'something', 'very', 'very', 'bad', 'going', 'happen', 'Bobby.The', 'film', 'climax', 'course', 'place', 'baseball', 'game', 'Bobby', 'having', 'hit', 'home', 'run', 'bat', 'more', 'pressure', 'anybody', 'else', 'history', 'game', 'Casey', 'bat', 'Meaningless', 'Bobby', 'Thompson', '1951', 'National', 'League', 'Playoffs', 'Nothing', 'Roy', 'Hobbs', 'trying', 'hit', 'one', 'son', 'Natural', 'close', 'mark', 'Roy', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'do', 'pouring', 'rain', 'struck', 'out', 'son', 'was', 'only', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'not', 'killed', 'complete', 'downpour', 'also', 'hit', 'off', 'pitcher', 'jumbo-tron', 'pitcher', 'pitching', 'Now', 'major', 'league', 'baseball', 'stadiums', 'do', 'not', 'show', 'live', 'pictures', 'action', 'field', 'why', 'end', 'Fan', 'where', 'story', 'abandoned', 'favor', 'big', 'cinematic', 'finish.The', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'Gil', 'madness', 'Bobby', 'batting', 'average', 'nosedive', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'Fan', 'point', 'primarily', 'case', 'parallel', 'character', 'studies', 'sense', 'character', 'played', 'Snipes', 'actually', 'more', 'interesting', 'De', 'Niro', 'get', 'insights', 'peculiar', 'psychoses', 'major', 'league', 'baseball', 'player', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'surprised', 'learn', 'what', 'two', 'men', 'most', 'very', 'different', 'explanations', 'why', 'Bobby', 'started', 'hitting.However', 'end', 'psychology', 'way', 'action', 'scene', 'uncomfortably', 'climax', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'impossible', 'accuse', 'star', 'going', 'top', 'film', 'Fan', 'end', 'Given', 'character', 'foundations', 'were', 'established', 'first', 'parts', 'film', 'one', 'instance', 'where', 'less', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more']",N/A

In &quot;The Fan,&quot; based on Peter Abraham's novel, De Niro plays Gil, a washed up knife salesman who is obsessed with baseball.  He's divorced from his wife, but has been able to maintain a relationship with his young, impressionable son.  However, as Gil becomes more psychotic, his ex-wife realizes the potential danger so she puts out a restraining order.  Meanwhile, Wesley Snipes' Bobby Rayburn recently purchased by the Giants for a cool forty million wants his #11 back, which has been given to Benito Del Torio's Juan Primo.  And then the slump hits Snipes.  DeNiro displays his loyalty by trying to get Primo to surrender the number and when he refuses, well it's....you can imagine.  Onward then, DeNiro finds a wonderful opportunity to get into Snipes life by rescuing his son, Sean, who is drowning.  He and Snipes almost bond, until Snipes confesses that he just doesn't care anymore, baseball is just  a game.  Snap goes what little is left of DeNiro's sanity and we face a showdown in a rain-drenched night game.Maybe overwrought, but Director Tony Scott handles everything so well, he elevates his film above it's derivative plot.  Some of the baseball scenes are quite beautiful; Ellen Barkin and Patti D'arbinville shimmer in great supporting roles; John Lequizamo as Snipes' manager is good, and Charles Hallahan (so good in the remake of &quot;The Thing&quot;) has a brief, but effective cameo as Coop, Gil's childhood buddy.Hans Zimmer's score is hauntingly beautiful and there are nice effects from the many Rolling Stones tunes that fill the picture.

His ex-wife wants nothing to do with him, and she wants the man nowhere near their son.The only thing Gil has left in life is watching baseball, and seeing one of his favorite players, Snipes, swing into action.

165448,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0800141822,Reviewer,"[8, 9]","It may be true that everyone during their lifetime has fifteen minutes of fame, even if in most cases it only lasts about a minute and a half.  And if that minute and a half comes early in life, how far into adulthood can you carry it with you, and when does a healthy memory become an obsession that finally blurs the line between reality and fantasy?  ""The Fan,"" directed by Tony Scott and starring Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes, is an intense and disturbing motion picture that examines that moment and the effects it can have on the lives of those either directly or indirectly involved.  Here, the focus is on one Gil Renard (De Niro), a knife salesman in San Francisco and a die-hard Giants fan who is pumped about the acquisition during the off-season of superstar centerfielder Bobby Rayburn (Snipes), whom he believes will bring a pennant to the team.  Once a player himself-- a pitcher-- Renard's life has since been on a downhill slide.  Divorced, he has a young, little league aged son, Richie (Andrew J. Ferchland), with whom he has an unsettling relationship, and at work, his sales have been so poor his job is on the line.  An angry, disturbed individual, Renard has reached a pivotal point in his life; for inspiration, he continually returns to the philosophies of the catcher from his playing days, Coop (Charles Hallahan), whom he considers one of the finest athletes he ever knew.  And as his life continues to deteriorate, his obsessions begin to add further to the imbalance of his perceptions of reality, which finally lead him past a point of no return.Scott's film, of course, has less to do with baseball than it does with how the game itself actually relates to life and the things that really matter.  As Rayburn says at one point, ""We're not curing cancer here.""  But to those to whom life has been reduced to that minute and a half to which they still cling, the game can be everything.  And it is just that unhealthy obsession that Scott examines in this film, that comparatively insignificant moment that in the obsessive mind becomes an episode of monumental importance that finally distorts any semblance of reality the individual may have left.  What's truly frightening is that upon close scrutiny, in Renard there is much with which many viewers will be able to relate in one way or another:  The anger, the frustration and perhaps the inability to let go of that minute and a half, even when it threatens to become more than just a pleasant memory, but an unhealthy lifeline to another place and another time that, in reality, may never have existed in the first place.  It's like a search for self-esteem by the has-been-who-never-was, who can neither realize nor accept it's elusiveness.  As Renard says to Richie, ""Baseball is better than life, because it's fair.  You hit a sacrifice fly and it doesn't count against your average.""  An ideal that has forever eluded Renard; in his life, he's never been able to ""give himself up for the team"" and get anything in return for it.As Renard, De Niro gives an explosive performance that at first glance may seem to have a bit of Travis Bickle and Max Cady in it-- which in fact it does-- though upon closer inspection, Renard is a unique character.  Those with a disturbed mind may have traits in common, as these characters De Niro has portrayed certainly do; but De Niro has successfully given each of them an individual personality, and when viewed side by side, the differences are readily apparent.  Bickle may be a sociopath, Cady a cold blooded killer; but Renard is a man who was just never able to get a handle on his life and has allowed his obsessions to dictate the choices he has made along the way.  De Niro is simply a master of his craft, with the ability to make his characters so real that a performance like this one is often overlooked; this is Oscar worthy work for which he never received the acclaim he was due.  His Renard is so like someone you would run into in your everyday life that in retrospect, it's scary.  But it's the kind of performance we've come to expect from De Niro, and as usual, he does not disappoint.Wesley Snipes, as well, gives a solid performance as Rayburn that is one of his best ever, which is not surprising when you consider with whom he was working.  If you study De Niro's films, you may discover a common thread running through them with regard to his co-stars.  De Niro has the ability to make those with whom he is working better; and it's something that stays with them forever after.  Consider Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep before ""The Deer Hunter,"" or Ed Harris before ""Jacknife.""  Certainly they were exceptional talents before, but they have arguably been better since.  And Snipes is no exception.  Nor is Benicio Del Toro (Recipient of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for ""Traffic""), who gives a memorable turn here as Rayburn's rival outfielder, Juan Primo.The supporting cast includes Patti D'Arbanville (Ellen),Ellen Barkin (Jewel), John Leguizamo (Manny), Chris Mulkey (Tim), Dan Butler (Garrity) and Brandon Hammond (Sean).  A thought provoking thriller that gives some real insight into the cause and effect of the psyche of human nature, ""The Fan"" is like an open wound that may hit too close to home for some.  And to dismiss this as just a ""baseball"" movie or another ""action"" flick would be a mistake, for there is much more here than meets the eye.  In the end, those who pay attention will ultimately reap the rewards it proffers.",4,Beyond &quot;Fan&quot; Into Obsession,986256000,"04 3, 2001",2001,5507,"['may', 'be', 'true', 'everyone',

I read that some guy said he brings back the travis bickle type character, thats not true, travis was a depressed lonely guy who liked a girl but she didnt like him so he tried to save another girl, he was shy, Deniros character in this may be lonley but he doesnt want love and he is not shy at all. Another said he brings out the Max Cady, nope, Max was a rapist and a killer, Deniros chacter in this may kill but he doesnt rape. I think people get the wrong impression from this movie, i think its great. I've also heard people say the story is unbelievable, but these are the same people who go home and watch blade and the matrix. I think the acting is great, its a good role for Deniro since his character is in almost every scene and has a lot of dialouge.

His separation from his wife is hostile, his business of selling knives is not going well, and he doesn't feel listened to.  His only release is sports, watching and cheering for his favorite player, Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes).Bobby Rayburn, a 40 million dollar player, has troubles of his own as he falls into a slump, knowing his career is winding down as fellow player Juan Primo's (Benico Del Toro) star is rising.  Primo now wears the ""sacred"" number 11 jersey.  Rooting Bobby on every step of the way is manager Manny (John Leguizamo).As Gil slides further down into the depths, he leans more and more on the game, forming an abnormal obsession with Bobby.  With a restraining order taken out by his ex-wife, keeping him away from his son, and the loss of even his lowly job as knife salesman, how far will Gil finally lose himself in his fixation on Bobby Rayburn?I tend to avoid movies that have even a dribble of sports in them, but I'm sure glad I tossed that rule aside for 'The Fan'.  It's not about sports, its about an irrational fanatic.  De Niro plays the psychotic fan so well, it could very well be his best performance yet.  Snipes, Del Toro, and Leguizamo are fantastic, joined by the beautiful and talented Ellen Barkin as reporter Jewel Stern.  The acting is superb and the tension is like a tight wire strung across your stomach.  Adding to the film is the music of Nine Inch Nails during Gil's more psychotic episodes, complimenting the scenes with their grinding music and lyrics of alienation.'The Fan' is a tense thriller that's not to be missed.

Murray ""The Mucker""","[2, 3]","Robert De Niro stars as a man whose life is taking a turn for the bad, but it does not deter him from his one true love, which is the game of baseball.  This film has several elements to it that connect to bring a tantalizing thriller of a script to the forefront.  The game of Baseball, its adoring and loyal fans and the psychotic fever of a fan who goes over the edge all come together well.  Some people might think this film is about De Niro's character obsessing over a particular player, but there is more to it than that.  Wes Snipes plays a major league player who has recently transferred from the Braves to the San Francisco Bay area to play for the Giants.Gil (De Niro) is an avid fan who realizes that in order for his team to have the best chance of succeeding during a hitting slump that Bobby Rayburn (Snipes) has, must up the stakes of his involvement in the players life.  De Niro and Snipes are excellent together throughout this film, and if you are a baseball fan you might recognize John Kruk featured in the lineup as well.  The Soundtrack is particularly good and it mixes eerie tunes from the score with hit singles from bands like The Rolling Stones and Nine Inch Nails.  The final scene at the ballpark is a spectacular way for this film to cap it all off, and despite this film being over ten years old, I still found great enjoyment in viewing it.
