431896,A7RM685PHBK20,6304681518,Eric,"[1, 2]","Most people probably won't agree, but I found Operation COndor to be a bit lacking.  Yes, there is a lot of hand-to-hand combat to the film but it leaves a lot to be desired as the action sequences (with the exception of  the car chase and the last one) lack creativity and start to feel rather  repetitive after we watch Chan beat up the same guys over and over and over  again.  As to where First Strike featured the fabulous sequence that  involved Chan fighting with chairs, tables, sticks, a broom, and even a  ladder (a big one, too) and Who am I? had the great two against one martial  arts fight on top of a building Operation Condor basically has Chan  fighting a bunch of hired guns underneath the ground.  It surprisingly  lacks tension and excitement considering this is Jackie Chan we're talking  about.Chan's attempts for Indiana Jones are a bit misplaced.  Yes, there  are some genuinely humorous moments, particularly in the beginning, but I  found the majority of the jokes to be flat and unfunny, something that's  usually not common with Jackie Chan films.But the most damaging aspect  of the movie were Chan's three female companions, played by Carol Cheng,  Eva Cobo de Garcia, and Ikeda Shoko.  While Garcia was okay and mostly  unannoying in her role, Cheng and Shoko really know how to get on the  viewer's nerves.Chan's later attempts after this proved to be better (in  my opinion) and he has since then made some of his best films.

What they are not told (but Chan finds out really quickly) is that there are a few other small factions of criminals after it also.The movie opens with a great Indiana Jones parody, which is more than enough to get you used to Jackie Chan's character.  The other characters are either comic support, or stuntmen in which a few can act well enough to say a few lines before they get beaten up in some of Jackie's coolest action ever.This movie quite possibly contains more action than any other Chan movie, as every scene is either a fight scene or a setup for one.  It is high charged, whitty and fast; hey, it was written, directed and co-produced by Jackie Chan himself!  Now with the DVD version, you can see more via widescreen, and the added detail really adds to both the picture and intensity, for there were badguys standing next to Jackie when he was beating up one of their mates that you can't see on the VHS version.

His most expensive HK picture, it's also one of his most enjoyable in its uncut version, but sadly this Miramax/Dimension version has typically cut 14 minutes from the Hong Kong version (the US theatrical version actually cut 26 minutes!). It ain't art, but it is fun, and some of the stunts in the massive underground set have to be seen to be disbelieved.Unfortunately, this a disappointing DVD all round. It's not just that UK label Hong Kong Legends' excellent Hong Kong DVDs have raised the bar in terms of extras and picture quality, this Dimension release is the dubbed and heavily edited US cut. The UK PAL  release is uncut, but  sadly dubbed and  not the best of  transfers.
