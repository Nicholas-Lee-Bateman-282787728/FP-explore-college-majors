It's pretty creepy, the acting is good, and it's not a gore fest. This movie is just a good, creepy, kinda scary movie. Charlie Crowe (Dallas Roberts) is a late night radio talk show host who gets a call from a very frightened kid who says he can't sleep or the shadow People will get him. Charlie thinks at first that this is some hoax or the kid is mental, but when he ends up dead, Charlie starts to do some digging into the myth of the Shadow People (who, I guess are documented-though before watching this film, I'd never heard of them-which actually creeps me out even more). Charlie's radio show begins to skyrocket in popularity when the subject of Shadow People is discussed on his show by callers who want to talk about their own experiences with the scary Shadow People. Charlie uncovers some interesting work done by a sleep doctor may point to the existence of the monsters.Dallas Roberts does a great job portraying Charlie Crowe and carries most of the movie, though, Allison Eastwood does a good job as a woman working for the CDC who is in Crowe's neck of the woods to check out the mysterious deaths that have been occurring in the area.If you like scary movies but don't like the blood baths many turn into, you might like this one.

However, the movie pretty much spins its wheels for the next hour and fifteen minutes.

The creepiness factor is pretty low if you're someone who watches this kind of stuff all the time.  The ending was also predictable if you watch this kind of stuff all the time.  In short, the film never really reaches a fever-pitch and offers an ending that provides very few answers.  Anyway, the movie was just kind of blah.

It's more about the subject and plot of this movie which is about the shadow people. Something to do with creatures or entities that live in or are shadows and attack people at night when you go to sleep mostly. Not the greatest movie but the subject matter I think is very interesting and thats why I'm rating it a 4 instead of a 3 and the fact that when I watched this it actually scared me a bit. I was by myself in my house watching this in the dark before bed so it was a perfect storm. Normally movies don't scare me at all but something about this one just hit a nerve and I'm still thinking about it a day later and checking the corners at night for some shadows that shouldn't be there. So I guess the movie did it's job fully because I'm still creeped out a bit. Acting not so hot but not terrible and like I said a very very slow movie with minimal shocks.

Most times I enjoy the film and then go on about my business with no worries. However, every once in a while a true gem of fear comes along and leaves its imprint on me as I shut off all the lights in the house and head to bed. Matthew Arnold's ""Shadow People"" had me searching the walls and windows for ghastly spots of unexplained darkness after watching it.Participants in an experimental sleep study in the 1970s report seeing strange shadowy figures. They and several hundred other individuals die in their sleep soon after. The phenomenon was given the name SUNDS, which stands for ""Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome."" Doctors wouldn't talk about the shadows.In the present, failing radio talk show host Charlie Crowe begins receiving calls from a teenager claiming shadowy intruders are coming for him. At first, Charlie believes the kid is mentally ill. His theory is challenged when the boy dies in his sleep. Things get even weirder when listeners of his talk show and people he tells about the mysterious shadowy figures begin dying in their sleep. Are these clusters of deaths a coincidence or are there sinister nocturnal forces at work?""Shadow People"" takes the sort of ideas our nightmares are made of and puts them in a visual package. Everything you've ever thought about someone or something watching you in your sleep is brought to life in this creepy little indie film.Director Matthew Arnold shows great promise through his mastery of timing. He has a knack for setting up what you would expect to be your typical jump scare and somehow delivering it in an off-tempo manner that leaves the viewer surprised and shuddering.I can't say I completely agree with every choice of filmmaking he used for ""Shadow People."" The movie is presented in the manner of many true crime TV shows are. It's a re-enactment of ""true events"" with the actual people involved giving their commentary along the way. The concept is interesting but gets a bit distracting as the terror unfolds.Many religious individuals would express their belief that shadow people are demons or evil spirits. Much like in ""The Possession"" or ""The Exorcist,"" the person has brought something into their house that allowed the entity access. I am of that mindset more so than any other concept brought up in this.If I were to compare ""Shadow People"" to other movies out there just as a way to spark people's interest, ""The Ring"" and ""The Apparition"" immediately come to mind. By no means is this a carbon copy of either of those films. They just came to mind as I sat watching it.The audio and video transfers for ""Shadow People"" look and sound good. A few of the ghostly scenes created by CGI suffer in a high definition format, but it doesn't ruin the overall viewing experience. The musical jolts used in the movie's score will have the audience pulling their heads out of the ceilings of their living rooms.The only special feature included on this Blu-ray release is a featurette entitled ""'Shadow People:' More to the Story."" It gives viewers exactly what it claims to: more information about the phenomenon known as ""Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome"" (SUNDS). It's short, but offers additional data to think about as you lie in bed eyes wide and darting around your room as you attempt to drift off to sleep.""Shadow People"" is that rare horror movie that leaves a lasting impression on its audience. The fear might wear off over time, but you'll never completely stop thinking about it. We all wake up in the middle of the night gasping for air, feeling like something is sitting on us, or thinking we're being watched.

The director uses camera work, light and dark, shadows, facial expressions and open-ended questions with the mastery of a great storyteller.  The film is based on a 1970s experimental sleep study during which the patients (volunteers)reported seeing shadowy figures in reflections and around them. Some of these patients died in their sleep a short after. This phenomenon is called 'Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome'.The film begins in a documentary style with many people chiming in about an uploaded video about the experiment gone wrong.  Enter Charlie Crowe (Dallas Roberts), a second-rate late-night radio host who takes a call from a young man who is reporting this phenomena.  The young man sends Crowe an envelop filled with data and photos from the original experiment.

What are the odds that those rave reviews came from people who were involved with the movie?  99.99%?  Stealing a gimmick from the awful Milla Jovovich vehicle The Fourth Kind, Shadow People purports to be based on a true story and mixes in footage of the ""actual people"" involved with the incident being dramatized along with the acted footage.  If you're going to rip off an idea you should probably do it from a good movie.  The plot involves people dying in their sleep for no apparent reason.  The movie seems to suggest that there is some sort of Ring-like curse going on where if you believe in the Shadow People then they can kill you.  There's also a scientific experiment, You Tube footage, a prologue in Cambodia and scads of fake talking head documentary footage--in other words pretty much anything the filmmakers could think of to pad out the running time enough to make this garbage a feature.  None of it hangs together in a coherent way and absolutely none of it is scary.

1616745,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00ATP23TW,John's Horror Corner,"[1, 2]","This movie opens with a disclaimer: The following motion picture is based on an actual case of mysterious deaths and the viral video known as &#34;Sleep Study GR16 1971.&#34;  We have used footage and interviews with real people whenever possible.Late night radio host Charlie (Dallas Roberts) is more than a little displeased with his job.  His divorced life is equally dissatisfying as he is serially disrespected by his ex and their son (Mattie Liptak; Quarantine 2: The Terminal).  At an all-time low in his career he gets a call from a frightened teenager who claims to see ghostly shadows at night.  After readily dismissing the teenagers story, he receives a package from the disturbed caller containing documents pertinent to a strange sleep study in which the subjects all reported seeing shadowy creatures as well.  The teen calls again to talk about the study and his fears.  He concludes that &#34;when you think of them, they come for you.&#34;  During the call the teen describes his fears, reveals he has a gun, fires, and well, things seem to have escalated along with Charlie's ratings.His producer Tom Dimartino (himself and Christopher Berry) suggests that he visit the caller, who is now in the hospital after shooting the wall, to follow up on the story for the sake of ratings.  Charlie goes to the hospital to meet the boy only to learn that he died in his sleep during that first night of his stay.  Now a bit perturbed, Charlie goes to Camden College (where the sleep study was conducted).  He does some library research and a student librarian assistant (Mariah Bonner) who takes an interest in his show happens to find out what Charlie's researching when she fixes a paper jam in the copier he was using.  She was found dead by her roommate that night.With this second death, Charlie becomes a believer and makes his radio show all about it.  His radio show is now abuzz with talk of drugs, mental illness and schizophrenia as callers flooded the airways with likely causes of how two healthy young people died in their sleep.  &#34;Real footage&#34; of locals' and witnesses' testimonials add flavor.  Over time, the calls shift from attempts to explain the sleeping deaths to callers' accounts of experiencing sleep paralysis and sightings of shadowy figures.  Charlie questions, with so many telling the same story &#34;Could it all be real?&#34;Sophie (Alison Eastwood), a CDC researcher rep, meets with Charlie to discuss the recent sleep-related deaths.  Autopsies revealed no pathogens, heavy metals or health history to explain the deaths.  Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome is the suggested cause.  But Charlie believes in something of a more primordial, sentient cause.  His mission to reveal the truth leads to a national media blitz&#8230;will it work?  Can he stop these deaths?As we stare at the screen waiting to sleuth out the next rogue shadow we are left with a haunting notion: The shadow people know when we think of them and then they come for us&#8230;so how do you stop thinking about something?Whereas some of the shadow effects were perfectly executed in my eyes, others were not ideal.  For example, running shadowy figures may make me jump, but that's not the same as eliciting fear.  The shadows that are still and suddenly noticed in the background, or slowly moving, or out of sync with the caster of the shadow...THOSE are the scary effects.  THOSE are chilling.Overall I was pleased with the jump scares.  Watch this in the dark.  This film is good at building tension as you anticipate seeing something weird in the shadows, much like the intensity of Paranormal Activity (2007).  It's creepy.  You know it's probably about to happen, then it happens, and you're still shaken by it!  The ending, while not some super clever twist, was elegant and simple and I appreciated it.  From start to finish, I was very surprised and pleased with this.  I find none of the typical, in fact expected, flaws of horror: over-exposition, poor character development, stale writing, effects demonstrative of a forced and over-extended budget, frightlessly empty scares, inconsistency in pacing or story and, perhaps worst of all, lame endings indicative of a lack of vision.This solid film was written and directed by Matthew Arnold, who has done basically nothing else in terms of feature length films or horror.  Like The Day (2011), The Shrine (2010) and The Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh (2012), this film really shocked me.  While not as original as the other three in story or style, Shadow People was without a doubt finely crafted, acted and filmed such that I am excited to see whatever Matthew Arnold does next.",5,"Creepy and tense, this indie film was finely crafted, acted and filmed from start to finish and exceeded all expectations!",1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,4687,"['movie', 'disclaimer', 'following', 'motion', 'picture', 'based', 'actual', 'case', 'mysterious', 'deaths', 'viral', 'video', 'known', '34', 'Sleep', 'Study', 'GR16', '1971.', '34', 'have', 'used', 'footage', 'interviews', 'real', 'people', 'possible.Late', 'night', 'radio', 'host', 'Charlie', 'Dallas', 'Roberts', 'more', 'little', 'displeased', 'job', 'divorced', 'life', 'equally', 'dissatisfying', 'serially', 'disrespected', 'ex', 'son', 'Mattie', 'Liptak', 'Quarantine', '2', 'Terminal', 'all-time', 'low', 'career', 'call', 'frightened', 'teenager', 'who', 'see', 'ghostly', 'shadows', 'night', 'readily', 'dismissing', 'teenagers', 'story', 'package', 'disturbed', 'caller', 'containing', 'documents', 'pertinent', 'strange', 'sleep', 'study', 'subjects', 'reported', 'seeing', 'shadowy', 'creatures', 'well', 'teen', 'calls', 'again', 'talk', 'study', 'fears', '34', 'when', 'think', 'come', 'you.', '34', 'call', 'teen', 'fears', 'reveals', 'gun', 'fires', 'well', 'things', 'seem', 'have', 'escalated', 'Charlie', 'ratings.His', 'producer', 'Tom', 'Dimartino', 'Christopher', 'Berry', 'caller', 'who', 'now', 'hospital', 'shooting', 'wall', 'follow', 'up', 'story', 'sake', 'ratings', 'Charlie', 'hospital', 'meet', 'boy', 'only', 'learn', 'died', 'sleep', 'first', 'night', 'stay', 'Now', 'bit', 'perturbed', 'Charlie', 'Camden', 'College', 'where', 'sleep', 'study', 'was', 'conducted', 'library', 'research', 'student', 'librarian', 'assistant', 'Mariah', 'Bonner', 'who', 'interest', 'show', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Charlie', 'researching', 'when', 'fixes', 'paper', 'jam', 'copier', 'was', 'using', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'roommate', 'second', 'death', 'Charlie', 'believer', 'radio', 'show', 'radio', 'show', 'now', 'abuzz', 'talk', 'drugs', 'mental', 'illness', 'schizophrenia', 'callers', 'flooded', 'airways', 'likely', 'causes', 'how', 'two', 'healthy', 'young', 'people', 'died', 'sleep', '34', 'Real', 'footage', '34', 'locals', 'witnesses', 'testimonials', 'add', 'flavor', 'time', 'calls', 'shift', 'attempts', 'explain', 'sleeping', 'deaths', 'callers', 'accounts', 'experiencing', 'sleep', 'paralysis', 'sightings', 'shadowy', 'figures', 'Charlie', 'questions', 'so', 'many', 'telling', 'same', 'story', '34', 'Could', 'be', 'real', '34', 'Sophie', 'Alison', 'Eastwood', 'CDC', 'researcher', 'rep', 'meets', 'Charlie', 'discuss', 'recent', 'sleep-related', 'deaths', 'Autopsies', 'revealed', 'pathogens', 'heavy', 'metals', 'health', 'history', 'explain', 'deaths', 'Sudden', 'Unexplained', 'Nocturnal', 'Death', 'Syndrome', 'suggested', 'cause', 'Charlie', 'something', 'more', 'primordial', 'sentient', 'cause', 'mission', 'reveal', 'truth', 'national', 'media', 'blitz', '8230', 'will', 'work', 'Can', 'stop', 'deaths', 'stare', 'screen', 'waiting', 'sleuth', 'out', 'next', 'rogue', 'shadow', 'are', 'left', 'haunting', 'notion', 'shadow', 'people', 'know', 'when', 'think', 'then', 'come', '8230', 'how', 'do', 'stop', 'thinking', 'something', 'Whereas', 'shadow', 'effects', 'were', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'eyes', 'others', 'were', 'not', 'ideal', 'example', 'running', 'shadowy', 'figures', 'may', 'make', 'jump', 'not', 'same', 'eliciting', 'fear', 'shadows', 'are', 'still', 'suddenly', 'noticed', 'background', 'slowly', 'moving', 'sync', 'caster', 'shadow', 'THOSE', 'are', 'scary', 'effects', 'THOSE', 'are', 'chilling.Overall', 'was', 'pleased', 'jump', 'scares', 'Watch', 'dark', 'film', 'good', 'building', 'tension', 'anticipate', 'seeing', 'something', 'weird', 'shadows', 'much', 'intensity', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '2007', 'creepy', 'know', 'probably', 'happen', 'then', ""'re"", 'still', 'shaken', 'ending', 'not', 'super', 'clever', 'twist', 'was', 'elegant', 'simple', 'appreciated', 'start', 'finish', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'pleased', 'find', 'none', 'typical', 'fact', 'expected', 'flaws', 'horror', 'over-exposition', 'poor', 'character', 'development', 'stale', 'writing', 'effects', 'demonstrative', 'forced', 'over-extended', 'budget', 'frightlessly', 'empty', 'scares', 'inconsistency', 'pacing', 'story', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'lame', 'endings', 'indicative', 'lack', 'vision.This', 'solid', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Matthew', 'Arnold', 'who', 'done', 'basically', 'nothing', 'else', 'terms', 'feature', 'length', 'films', 'horror', 'Day', '2011', 'Shrine', '2010', 'Last', 'Will', 'Testament', 'Rosalind', 'Leigh', '2012', 'film', 'really', 'shocked', 'not', 'as', 'original', 'other', 'three', 'story', 'style', 'Shadow', 'People', 'was', 'doubt', 'finely', 'crafted', 'acted', 'filmed', 'such', 'am', 'excited', 'see', 'Matthew', 'Arnold', 'next']",N/A

Even more disturbing, the caller attributes the death to ... da-da-duuum! Shadow People!The movie claims to be based on true events, and I even know people who profess to having seen these people. Given the human brain's propensity to see humanity in everything from clouds to burnt toast, it's not so unusual that people have personified the darkness. And also given how little we know about the world and our place in it, sure, it's also possible that there may be life on other planes of existence that we can only perceive as shadows. Or maybe its pixies. Who knows?That's really the big flaw of the film. It tries to find spookiness in two things. The first is the plot's real world inspirations (""actual"" footage of people from the story is often shown in tandem with the movie footage). This never really hits home because all you really get from this are various homely looking people saying fairly mundane stuff. Some believe in shadow people. Others don't. The second well that the movie tries to draw fear from is in the actual shadow people themselves. There are a few moments when this is done effectively, but since it's a pretty old horror movie trope -- the malignant darkness moving around -- it gets pretty old pretty fast.The movie neuters itself the most when it tries to get serious with its own concept. There are a lot of shadow people theories thrown around, but the movie's biggest guess is that maybe we are creating these beings ourselves, basically allowing ourselves to be subsumed by fear. Although the film never really does explain the shadow people and leaves most of the story up to the imagination, this is the theory it keeps returning to over and over again. That lack of a conclusion ends up taking a lot of the wind out of the film's sails, and its insistence that maybe we're doing this to ourselves ends up ripping the sails to pieces, since it basically exposes the conceit behind all scary movies everywhere, turning what should've been a decently spooky flick into an over-thought treatise on what it means to be scared.",3,I Ain't 'Fraid of No Shadow People,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,2206,"['Dallas', 'Roberts', 'radio', 'DJ', 'failing', 'program', 'who', 'gains', 'notoriety', 'when', 'caller', 'accurately', 'own', 'death', 'airwaves', 'Even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'caller', 'death', 'da-da-duuum', 'Shadow', 'People', 'movie', 'be', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'even', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'profess', 'having', 'seen', 'people', 'Given', 'human', 'brain', 'propensity', 'see', 'humanity', 'everything', 'clouds', 'burnt', 'toast', 'not', 'so', 'unusual', 'people', 'have', 'personified', 'darkness', 'also', 'given', 'how', 'little', 'know', 'world', 'place', 'sure', 'also', 'possible', 'may', 'be', 'life', 'other', 'planes', 'existence', 'can', 'only', 'perceive', 'shadows', 'maybe', 'pixies', 'Who', 'really', 'big', 'flaw', 'film', 'find', 'spookiness', 'two', 'things', 'first', 'plot', 'real', 'world', 'inspirations', 'actual', 'footage', 'people', 'story', 'often', 'shown', 'tandem', 'movie', 'footage', 'never', 'really', 'home', 'really', 'get', 'are', 'various', 'homely', 'looking', 'people', 'saying', 'fairly', 'mundane', 'stuff', 'believe', 'shadow', 'people', 'Others', 'do', ""n't"", 'second', 'well', 'movie', 'draw', 'fear', 'actual', 'shadow', 'people', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'when', 'done', 'effectively', 'pretty', 'old', 'horror', 'movie', 'trope', 'malignant', 'darkness', 'moving', 'around', 'pretty', 'old', 'pretty', 'fast.The', 'movie', 'neuters', 'most', 'when', 'get', 'serious', 'own', 'concept', 'are', 'lot', 'shadow', 'people', 'theories', 'thrown', 'around', 'movie', 'biggest', 'guess', 'maybe', 'are', 'creating', 'beings', 'ourselves', 'basically', 'allowing', 'be', 'subsumed', 'fear', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'explain', 'shadow', 'people', 'most', 'story', 'up', 'imagination', 'theory', 'returning', 'over', 'again', 'lack', 'conclusion', 'up', 'taking', 'lot', 'wind', 'film', 'sails', 'insistence', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'doing', 'ourselves', 'up', 'ripping', 'sails', 'pieces', 'basically', 'conceit', 'scary', 'movies', 'everywhere', 'turning', 'what', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'decently', 'spooky', 'flick', 'over-thought', 'treatise', 'what', 'be', 'scared']",N/A

The only problem is that it seems like lately they either use lame ideas or rework some past film into a new and improved version. So when an original film comes along I'm always ready to let other know how good it is. SHADOW PEOPLE is one of the good ones.Charlie Crowe (Dallas Roberts of THE WALKING DEAD) is a late night radio DJ who takes calls from people who discuss weird topics from aliens to hauntings. One of his callers has sent him a package and later calls to tell him he's afraid to sleep for fear of dying, attacked by shadow people he's been seeing. While he at first believes the caller is off his rocker and in need of help, he changes his mind when he learns the same caller dies in his sleep.Crowe begins digging deeper into the mysteries of shadow people, finding out that they have been studied and the results are not hopeful. He learns that this was not the first person to complain of the shadow people and their intent on killing and that others have died the same way, in their sleep. As he digs deeper he too begins seeing shadow people and one can only hope he finds a way to survive this experience.The idea of shadow people is nothing new and most recently talked about in nearly every ghost hunting show around. The idea of these shadows as spirits stuck in a certain location is the way those shows describe it but in this film these shadow people are very mobile, moving from one person to another, location to location.The way the film shows the shadow people uses limited special effects and offers small glimpses rather than full on in your face displays. This adds to the creepy feeling that they invoke. You never feel cheated in not seeing them rather they make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end. The entire film has the ability to make you feel that way offering chills rather than thrills, something lacking in most horror films these days.If you're looking for a movie that was made on a shoe string budget but that delivers some unique scares then this one is for you.

1616752,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00ATP23TW,Matthew Scott Baker,"[2, 2]","SHADOW PEOPLE is one of those films that claims to be based on true events.  I don't know if this is true or not, but I can definitely see how it could be in this case.  The subject matter is steeped in realism and I would wager we have all experienced something like this at one time or another.  Heck, I had trouble going to sleep last night after watching this one...and that's saying something for a guy that watches horror movies regularly!  Needless to say, this is one film that any horror fan needs to check out soon!I am stunned that 162 reviewers on IMDB.com have given this film only 4.4 stars out of 10 as of the writing of this review.  I figured this would have garnered at least 6 or 7 stars out of 10.  That's what I would have ranked it as, anyway.  It's that good.SHADOW PEOPLE is shot very well and combines supposed archival footage with movie-style reenactments of the same events.  Some folks might not like this, but I find it works very well when done correctly.  This film pulls it off with ease.The acting is also great, with Dallas Roberts headlining the cast as radio host Charlie Crowe.  Horror fans will recognize Roberts from his role on THE WALKING DEAD.  Roberts does a stellar job in this role, and I look forward to seeing him on-screen in the future.The best aspect of SHADOW PEOPLE is how it scares you:  the shadowy beings that are seen on camera strike a primal chord deep within the viewer's mind.

Even at the beginning when the ""true story"" introduction came out I thought ""here we go one of those stupid Blare Witch knock offs"" (not that I liked Blare Witch). It is not a ""Found Footage film"" it is a movie with real life footage seamlessly inserted throughout the film and this also made it different than most true story films. I also believe this makes the film better because you are getting to see the real people instead of having to wait till the end like many other true event movies and from the beginning it was interesting. As the movie went on, the mix between real footage and the movie footage that was very well done, the film captivated me.  Watching this at home by myself one evening I can't recall another independent film literally at times sending chills throughout my body.

1616756,A1K6K23WG0IBWE,B00ATP23TW,Quadro Sinead Summer,"[9, 14]","Back in the mid 1980's I was with a friend housesitting for my step brother in Honolulu, Hawaii. We had decided to watch Night of the Living Dead one evening but fell asleep mid- way through. We had both fallen asleep on the floor next to each other. There was a powerful storm outside during this time. The front door of this small very old apartment had a spring that would close it automatically, then a latch lock would lock the door when it closed. I was often forgetting and locked my self out several times. There was no way to change this auto lock latch so it wouldn't lock.While we were sleeping I had a dream that the door busted open from the force of the wind. I saw my self laying next to my friend in the dream. Suddenly a shadow looking human-like figure came in the door and creeped up to my friend and bent down to where he was laying asleep. I saw it as though it was whispering in his ear, leaning over him. At that moment I heard a loud scream and that woke me up. As I woke, I saw a real shadow figure in the dim lighting swoosh quickly toward the hall then vanish around the corner. I then swung my head at my friend who was screaming and truly terrified. He was looking around all over the room and I kept asking what he was looking for.He said, ""Something attacked me in my sleep, I saw this wierd shadow like being in my sleep"". I got seriously scared and said loudly, ""Oh my god! YOU SAW IT TOO?!!!"" His eyes got very big and he said, ""You saw a shadow being?"" I said ""Yes, I saw it leaning over you in my dream, when I woke to your screaming I saw it fly away around the corner toward my brother's bedroom"". We were both extremely terrified. He said ""Oh my god, I saw that too, but while I was still asleep, I saw it fly around the corner, then I woke"". It was at that moment that we noticed the front door was standing open and the wind was blowing in. We went to the door to discover the spring had broken and the lock was also busted.We thought maybe a powerful wind had done it, but we noticed the wind had already calmed to a gentle shower by that time. We turned all the lights on and slowly walked to the kitched and grabbed two butcher knives, and began to walk slowly toward the halway, very scared. My step brother's bedroom had a door that opened outward toward the hall. He never shut it and there was always one of those large rowing machines used for excercise standing up against the opened door. This machine weighed about 150 pounds. When we got around the corner into the small hallway of this small one bedroom apartment. We were in a state of shock at what we saw.The machine was all the way at the other end of the hall standing upright in the opposite corner, and the bedroom door was closed. We finally worked up the courage to open the door and we carefully checked the closet, bathroom that was in there, and there was nothing there. Both the windows in the room were locked shut. We searched the rest of the apartment and found nothing. Within minutes after that we both began to feel very very tired and at the same time we just felt suddenly and oddly uncaring about what had just moments before terrified us to near death. We tried to talk about what we saw in our dreams, and then the next thing I knew it was daylight and we had both fallen asleep not remember anything that happened the night before.Weeks later we were having dinner out with a few friends, and someone started talking about apparitions, then from across the table we both stared big eyed at each other, and pointing at one another, we both said ""Oh my god, you remmeber? That night!!"" We sat there for hours telling everyone what happened. We couldn't understand that such a terrifying event was striken from our memories until a key subject brought it all back to us.It was the only time we ever experienced these Shadow People, but it still sends chills down my spine when ever I think about it. Some years later when the Mothman Prophecies came out we thought maybe we had seen the Mothman that night. Only two days ago I learned of this film, and that there was actually Shadow People encounters in the 80's. I had never heard of these Shadow People until two days ago.
