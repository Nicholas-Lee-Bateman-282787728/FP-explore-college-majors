1494621,A2KZQY1VW9JDWV,B005MYEPXC,Absolem,"[2, 2]","Owen Wilson plays amiable Gil, a self admitted ""Hollywood hack"" script writer from Beverly Hills. He has a fiance so Malibu Barbie you can easily imagine a product number on the bottom of her foot, a pair of irritable, materialistic, Republican in-laws, and a novel he is having difficulty translating from thoughts to paper.Gil is thrilled to be in Paris, where his father-in-law is making a nondescript business deal, and is expressing this by immersing himself in the locations and stories of writers, artists, and musicians long gone, while his fiance gripes about how charming the streets are. Friends of his wife arrive seemingly by surprise, a patronizing ""intellectual"" who collects facts only to impress other people with them and his oblivious wife. Gil finds them overbearing but his wife is charmed, and the group separates. On his way back to the hotel, Gil gets himself hopelessly lost, as predicted by his wife, but instead of panicking, he sits down on some steps and listens to the clock chime at midnight. A car manufactured almost a century ago rolls around the corner, and Gil is invited in by a group of strangers wreathed in smoke and laden with champagne glasses. Much in the same way Alice falls down a rabbit hole and discovers herself in Wonderland, Gil realizes he has been transported to the 1920's, and the handful of journeys he takes there are parallel to hers. Each night he enters the car, someone new is there to greet him, from Scott Fitzgerald to Hemingway to T.S. Eliot, Gil bounces like a ping pong ball from one long gone idol to the next, going to drink, going to dance, going to get help with his novel from Gertrude Stein.This is a simple movie that doesn't bother to explain just how Gil gets to the 1920's because it isn't necessary to know, and even if we did know it wouldn't have any bearing on the story. It is never implied that Gil might be hallucinating or dreaming; and we are pleased about this, because we like Gil, we are like Gil, we understand.The message is straightforward ""Enjoy what you have and don't dwell on or in the past because even the past thinks the past is better"" (indeed of course we would all like to live in the past because we are already aware of what was good and what was bad there, while in the present hardly anyone knows what is going on or if where they are is the best place they could be), and actually established fairly early, but it's a raving blast to get there.",5,Fantastic Film for the Fellow Delusional Romantics,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,2451,"['Owen', 'Wilson', 'amiable', 'Gil', 'self', 'admitted', 'Hollywood', 'hack', 'script', 'writer', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'fiance', 'so', 'Malibu', 'Barbie', 'can', 'easily', 'imagine', 'product', 'number', 'bottom', 'foot', 'pair', 'irritable', 'materialistic', 'Republican', 'in-laws', 'novel', 'having', 'difficulty', 'translating', 'thoughts', 'paper.Gil', 'thrilled', 'be', 'Paris', 'where', 'father-in-law', 'making', 'nondescript', 'business', 'deal', 'expressing', 'immersing', 'locations', 'stories', 'writers', 'artists', 'musicians', 'long', 'gone', 'fiance', 'gripes', 'how', 'charming', 'streets', 'are', 'Friends', 'wife', 'arrive', 'seemingly', 'surprise', 'patronizing', 'intellectual', 'who', 'only', 'impress', 'other', 'people', 'oblivious', 'wife', 'Gil', 'overbearing', 'wife', 'charmed', 'group', 'way', 'back', 'hotel', 'Gil', 'hopelessly', 'lost', 'predicted', 'wife', 'instead', 'panicking', 'down', 'steps', 'listens', 'clock', 'chime', 'midnight', 'car', 'manufactured', 'almost', 'century', 'ago', 'corner', 'Gil', 'invited', 'group', 'strangers', 'wreathed', 'smoke', 'laden', 'champagne', 'glasses', 'Much', 'same', 'way', 'Alice', 'down', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'discovers', 'Wonderland', 'Gil', 'been', 'transported', '1920', 'handful', 'journeys', 'are', 'parallel', 'hers', 'night', 'car', 'someone', 'new', 'there', 'greet', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'Hemingway', 'T.S', 'Eliot', 'Gil', 'ping', 'pong', 'ball', 'one', 'long', 'gone', 'idol', 'next', 'going', 'drink', 'going', 'dance', 'going', 'get', 'help', 'novel', 'Gertrude', 'Stein.This', 'simple', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bother', 'explain', 'just', 'how', 'Gil', '1920', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'know', 'even', 'did', 'know', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bearing', 'story', 'never', 'implied', 'Gil', 'might', 'be', 'hallucinating', 'dreaming', 'are', 'pleased', 'like', 'Gil', 'are', 'Gil', 'understand.The', 'message', 'straightforward', 'Enjoy', 'what', 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'past', 'even', 'past', 'past', 'better', 'indeed', 'course', 'would', 'like', 'live', 'past', 'are', 'already', 'aware', 'what', 'was', 'good', 'what', 'was', 'bad', 'there', 'present', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'what', 'going', 'where', 'are', 'best', 'place', 'could', 'be', 'actually', 'established', 'fairly', 'early', 'raving', 'blast', 'get', 'there']",N/A

This time the people visited are not sleeping, but the traveler, Gil, is. Sleeping and dreaming or day-dreaming. The third time you watch the film, you start noticing the dream characteristics of locations, people, conversations, movements, props and possibly even the Cole Porter Songs.

I'm mean how can I take lightly and laugh at the characters he portrays when his real life is in such despair?Anyway, I got over it when watching MIDNIGHT IN PARIS on a flight from Los Angeles to Tokyo and I must say that I really enjoyed the movie and Wilson was sort of channeling a young Woody Allen for his character ""Gil,"" a script writer who is trying to write a novel. Gil and his fianc&eacute; ""Inez,"" played by Rachel McAdams, go to Paris with her parents, and at midnight, Gil gets taken on a magical adventure to the roaring twenties and cafe society, meeting such luminaries as Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Salvador Dali, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Josephine Baker, etc., all in their prime, and even gets to go further back to the ""Belle Epoch"" era.The film makes great use of the sights in Paris and is shot with a warm filtered lens, so that everything has a yellow/reddish glow, reminding one of a romanticized version of ""Paris in spring-time."" Not only is the movie visually appealing, but there's a subtle message about how one can get caught up in living in the past -- or at least the idea of the past -- when really the only time that matters is the present.Graphically, the MIDNIGHT IN PARIS Blu-Ray has stunning picture quality, as it should, and though it isn't a overly serious or uproariously funny movie it has its charm and can be regarded as a comfort movie for those times when we all wished we were living in another place and time.Extras are paltry but as follows:*****  SPECIAL FEATURES  (HA!) *****Q&A; IN CANNES -- 04:57-minutesAllen and cast take questions from reporters in this short press junkette.PHOTO GALLERIESStills of cast etc.TRAILER -- 02:04-minutesI'm not sure what the Amazon mix up is about but this is what was on my Blu-Ray of MIDNIGHT IN PARIS.",4,A *Fantasy* Story About Living In the Present..,1339545600,"06 13, 2012",2012,1985,"['took', 'awhile', 'go', 'back', 'watching', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'light', 'comedies', 'real', 'life', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'was', 'kind', 'shattered', ""'m"", 'mean', 'how', 'can', 'take', 'lightly', 'laugh', 'characters', 'when', 'real', 'life', 'such', 'despair', 'Anyway', 'got', 'when', 'watching', 'MIDNIGHT', 'IN', 'PARIS', 'flight', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Tokyo', 'must', 'say', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Wilson', 'was', 'sort', 'channeling', 'young', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'character', 'Gil', 'script', 'writer', 'who', 'trying', 'write', 'novel', 'Gil', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Inez', 'played', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'go', 'Paris', 'parents', 'midnight', 'Gil', 'taken', 'magical', 'adventure', 'roaring', 'twenties', 'cafe', 'society', 'meeting', 'such', 'luminaries', 'Scott', 'Zelda', 'Fitzgerald', 'Salvador', 'Dali', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'Gertrude', 'Stein', 'Josephine', 'Baker', 'etc.', 'prime', 'even', 'go', 'further', 'back', 'Belle', 'Epoch', 'era.The', 'film', 'great', 'use', 'sights', 'Paris', 'shot', 'warm', 'filtered', 'lens', 'everything', 'yellow/reddish', 'glow', 'reminding', 'one', 'romanticized', 'version', 'Paris', 'spring-time', 'Not', 'only', 'movie', 'visually', 'appealing', 'subtle', 'message', 'how', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'living', 'past', 'least', 'idea', 'past', 'when', 'really', 'only', 'time', 'matters', 'present.Graphically', 'MIDNIGHT', 'IN', 'PARIS', 'Blu-Ray', 'stunning', 'picture', 'quality', 'should', ""n't"", 'overly', 'serious', 'uproariously', 'funny', 'movie', 'charm', 'can', 'be', 'regarded', 'comfort', 'movie', 'times', 'when', 'wished', 'were', 'living', 'place', 'time.Extras', 'are', 'paltry', '*****', 'SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'HA', '*****Q', 'A', 'IN', 'CANNES', '04:57-minutesAllen', 'cast', 'take', 'questions', 'reporters', 'short', 'press', 'junkette.PHOTO', 'GALLERIESStills', 'cast', 'etc.TRAILER', '02:04-minutesI', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Amazon', 'mix', 'up', 'was', 'Blu-Ray', 'MIDNIGHT', 'IN', 'PARIS']",N/A

Eliot, Man Ray, Pablo Picasso, hell even Djuana Barnes are names from the Jazz Age and the American post- World War I ex-paraite night that get bandied about in Woody Allen's 2011 comedic effort, Midnight In Paris. There were plenty of other names dropped as well but the above popped out in memory's eye and serve my point. This film is a paen to that by-gone age just far enough back for Woody (and me) to not have been splashed by the Jazz Age karma but wishing, wishing like crazy, we could have lived at that time -in that city, Paris and been washed by the spectacular antics and struggles that went on there to create a modern literary and cultural world. And in the end that is Woody's point, as he has one of his throw-back jazz Age characters pine for an even earlier time- the last quarter of the 19th century-La Belle Epogue. Nice spin, Woody.But to the plot that brings this whole thing together in magic realistic way and without being too ham-handed on the ""moral"". Woody (oops) Gil (played with some Woody-like physical and expressive mannerism by Owen Wilson) is a thouroughly modern frustrated Hollywood screenwriter who yearns to write the great American novel, or at least something other than the drivel that passes for language in most of his screenwriting. He and his fianc&eacute;, Inez (played by Rachael McAdams), are in Paris on a lark before getting married. Gil loves Paris, his version of Paris, the Paris of the American ex -pat 1920s Jazz Age when the great creative spirits of the early 20th century held forth and lit up the cultural post-war wasteland night.  Inez is a little, no, a lot more bourgeois, and just wants Gil to keep making the kale so they can afford that high-end La-La land lifestyle. This will no be a match made in heaven, no question.Gil though through cinematic magical realism finds his way back to the Paris of the 1920s around midnight each night and from there is able to find his true self, or what he thinks is his true self. Naturally a women (Pablo Picasso's, mistress, or one of them) is there to goad him along but also to pose the question about what craving for earlier unattainable times mean. In the end Gil is ""liberated"" from Inez (she was two-timing him anyway with some pedantic prof) and can walk the rainy 2010s streets of Paris and really make his literary breakthrough. This is one of  Woody's better recent efforts. Proof. A person whom I respect very much as a cinematic aficionado said this is the first Woody Allen film that she could sit through to the end and wish that it didn't end.

It is a small delight not meant to discover any epiphanies or push any agenda social or otherwise. It is about the love of Paris, Art and the 1920's and as a love letter to those three things it works very, very well.Owen Wilson plays Gil Pender, a man visiting Paris with his fiancee and her parents. Gil is a writer, a lover of Paris and a romantic who idealizes the life of the expatriate American artists and writers who so famously colonized Paris in the 1920's. It becomes clear early on that Gil and his intended are an ill-assorted couple, even to the point that they don't want to do the same tourist activities. There are deeper issues as well. Gil wants to quit Hollywood screenwriting and pursue novel writing, preferably in Paris. Inez, his girlfriend wants him to continue doctoring scripts so that they can afford eighteen thousand dollar chairs for their projected house in Malibu. One night Gil's fiancee goes dancing with other friends and Gil gets lost in the twisty streets of Paris. A mysterious vintage car stops and its inhabitants invite him to a party. It is some invitation as the party is in the Paris of the 1920s and with the artists that Gil so loves.What follows is a loving romp through that time period and to Gil's ultimate realization of how he should live his life. Even the character says that these are only minor insights. However, Allen's artistry and experience really show in every aspect of the movie. Paris is lovingly shot and the Lost Generation is wonderfully portrayed. As the theme was nostalgia and its dangers, I must in all honesty say that this movie had similarities to an earlier work of Allen's, The Purple Rose of Cairo, which also features the imaginary becoming real. I saw that movie in a theater when I was twelve years old and that movie enchanted me then as this movie enchants me now. Recommended but don't expect a major work like Match Point; this is a wonderful minor work.The one criticism I had is that Owen Wilson and his fiancee seemed a little old for the time in life they were portraying. People pushing 40 are generally not on their first marriage or if they are not so influenced by the opinions of their parents. Actors and actresses in their twenties for the part of Gil and Inez would have worked much better.",4,Enchanting,1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,2359,"['Midnight', 'Paris', 'not', 'one', 'Woody', 'Allen', ""'bigger"", 'serious', 'films', 'small', 'delight', 'not', 'meant', 'discover', 'epiphanies', 'push', 'agenda', 'social', 'otherwise', 'love', 'Paris', 'Art', '1920', 'love', 'letter', 'three', 'things', 'very', 'very', 'well.Owen', 'Wilson', 'Gil', 'Pender', 'man', 'visiting', 'Paris', 'fiancee', 'parents', 'Gil', 'writer', 'lover', 'Paris', 'romantic', 'who', 'life', 'expatriate', 'American', 'artists', 'writers', 'who', 'so', 'famously', 'colonized', 'Paris', '1920', 'clear', 'early', 'Gil', 'intended', 'are', 'ill-assorted', 'couple', 'even', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'same', 'tourist', 'activities', 'are', 'deeper', 'issues', 'well', 'Gil', 'quit', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriting', 'pursue', 'novel', 'writing', 'preferably', 'Paris', 'Inez', 'girlfriend', 'continue', 'doctoring', 'scripts', 'so', 'can', 'afford', 'eighteen', 'thousand', 'dollar', 'chairs', 'projected', 'house', 'Malibu', 'One', 'night', 'Gil', 'fiancee', 'dancing', 'other', 'friends', 'Gil', 'lost', 'twisty', 'streets', 'Paris', 'A', 'mysterious', 'vintage', 'car', 'stops', 'inhabitants', 'invite', 'party', 'invitation', 'party', 'Paris', '1920s', 'artists', 'Gil', 'loves.What', 'loving', 'romp', 'time', 'period', 'Gil', 'ultimate', 'realization', 'how', 'should', 'live', 'life', 'Even', 'character', 'are', 'only', 'minor', 'insights', 'However', 'Allen', 'artistry', 'experience', 'really', 'show', 'aspect', 'movie', 'Paris', 'lovingly', 'shot', 'Lost', 'Generation', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'theme', 'was', 'nostalgia', 'dangers', 'must', 'honesty', 'say', 'movie', 'had', 'similarities', 'earlier', 'work', 'Allen', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'also', 'imaginary', 'becoming', 'real', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'when', 'was', 'twelve', 'years', 'old', 'movie', 'enchanted', 'then', 'movie', 'now', 'Recommended', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'major', 'work', 'Match', 'Point', 'wonderful', 'minor', 'work.The', 'one', 'criticism', 'had', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'fiancee', 'seemed', 'little', 'old', 'time', 'life', 'were', 'portraying', 'People', 'pushing', '40', 'are', 'generally', 'not', 'first', 'marriage', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'influenced', 'opinions', 'parents', 'Actors', 'actresses', 'twenties', 'part', 'Gil', 'Inez', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'much', 'better']",N/A

The only exception to this statement was that I was aware that it was written and directed by Woody Allen.  Beyond this, I knew nothing.To my very pleasant surprise, I absolutely loved this film!  It was whimsical, funny and clever.  In essence, it covers a trip to Paris by an engaged American couple played by Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams.  Despite being engaged, they are quite different people. She is the sometimes petulant daughter of her whining parents who are travelling with the couple.  Owen Wilson as Gil, is a Hollywood screed writer who dreams of writing a great novel and longs to live in the bohemian Paris of the 1920s.  A time when Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald lived in the city and mixed with Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Paul Gaugin and others.The trick that Allen uses to enhance the story is that each evening, Gil is actually able to travel back in time. He meets and mixes with his heroes.  Perhaps this sounds absurd but Allen manages to pull it off.  The result is very funny.  No one from the 1920s suspects that Gil is a traveller from another time although his fianc&eacute;e and parents think he must be crazy.  He must be delusional.If the film has any message it is that people often yearn for earlier times.  We all speak of the good old days.  However, the good old days were rarely good.  Even Gil can identify that in the 1920s there were no antibiotics. For all its romance, earlier times were not without there drawbacks.I thoroughly recommend this film.  Owen Wilson as Gil is a revelation and Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein is terrific.  This is a top piece of modern cinema.",5,A Revelation.

1494642,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005MYEPXC,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I love Woody Allen.  He has such a delightful way of crafting his comedic adventures into something so thoughtful and provoking, without ever feeling heavy handed or manipulative.  He allows his characters to speak for themselves and their situations to come alive within a realm of awkward realism.`Midnight in Paris' has many of the same qualities that make Allen's filmography so impressive, but it lacks some of the internalized charm I was hoping for.  The performances are mostly uniformly great, with a few standouts, and the overall feel to the film is certainly effervescent in the way that most `great' Woody Allen films are, but there is a filmy layer of forcefulness that I didn't expect nor did I truly love.  Instead of allowing us to take from this film what we needed to take from it, Allen told us what we needed to glean, thus taking a little away from the film's actual impact.In `Midnight in Paris', we are introduced to a young couple on the cusp of marriage.  They are drastically different individuals.  Inez is self-centered and condescending and materialistic and Gil is a dreamer with his head in the clouds and his eyes set on a fantasy idea of what life should be like.  Inez and Gil accompany Inez's parents to Paris for a business venture.  Inez is more concerned with eating at posh restaurants and buying overly priced lawn furniture, while Gil just wants to soak in the beauty of the city.  Gil is obsessed with the past, the nostalgic feeling of a time lost to him because he is simply not content with what he has.  He is convinced that yesteryear was so much better than the time and place he dwells in now.  While spending time alone, the clock strikes midnight and Gil finds himself transporter to 1920's Paris, a time he often fantasized about living in, where he meets the likes of Fitzgerald and Hemingway and soon falls for a beautiful woman who has a thing for tortured artists.  Living in this fantasy deep into the early morning hours and then struggling to connect with his fianc&eacute;e during the day, Gil uncovers the truth about his wanderlust and begins to understand his relationship with Inez for what it really is.A mess.The acting is pretty good.  Owen Wilson basically plays Woody Allen and he does so with mixed results.  His soliloquys are somewhat misdirected and feel awkward, and not in the comedic way that Woody pulls them off, but he really captures the awestruck feelings thrust upon Gil.  Rachel McAdams plays a pretty horrible person, and she does so with a finesse was wasn't expecting.  Michael Sheen is a clich&eacute; and not as funny as I wanted him to be.  Marion Cotillard is mesmerizing as the alluring love interest for Gil, but it is Corey Stoll who steals the whole show as the boozing, self-obsessed, prolific Earnest Hemingway.My issues with `Midnight in Paris' lay with the script, which is surprising since it's Woody Allen and it's been winning award after award.  The script pushes Gil's personal views in a way that are consuming.  It is the only viewpoint expressed and it is done so rather heavy handed like.  The other thing that bothered me was that everyone in Gil's life was so different than him, so awful and unlikable that it made zero sense that he was even living the life he was living.  How did he end up with these people when he hates them and they obviously abuse him too often?  I also found parts of the film lazy, especially when you consider how Gil comes across a certain diary.Alas, Woody still knows how to create an air that is engulfing, and his recreation of 1920's Paris is charming to the hilt.  Whenever Gil is dwelling in that world, `Midnight in Paris' is a total keeper.

1494651,A23BTLTIHMJN01,B005MYEPXC,A. Simon,"[2, 5]","There is a very good side to this movie and a very bad side.Woody Allen has made some very good movies and some really awful movies; this one combines both sides.The good side is that part of the movie's plot is charmingly original: a wannabe writer (Gil) in Paris has a surrealistic experience (which is ironic) and at midnight he goes back to the Paris of the 1920s, transported in a gorgeous car to die for. He meets a who's who of the intellectual elite of the time: Cole Porter, Jean Cocteau, Luis Bunuel, Pablo Picasso, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, T. S. Eliot and Salvador Dali (what? no Ezra Pound?). Here, Allen has done his homework and the actors portray those personages perfectly; for example, Hemingway's speech is an aggressive staccato while Dali speaks as if he was on drugs. The enthusiasm that Gil experiences is infectious. The costumes are great as are the settings. As for Paris, it is a beautiful city, especially if one ignores the Parisians, whom even the French despise (and that says something right there!).Now for the bad side.Woody Allen is a pseudointellectual who likes to put down other pseudointellectuals and we see it in Gil's rivalry with Paul, as well as in other films. And only a pseudointellectual would think that living in Paris, and only in Paris, will automatically make one a good writer. Hundreds of superb writers, from Pushkin to Narayan to Unamono to Poe never lived in Paris. Mind you, Paris is a beautiful city, but so is Florence, London, Munich, Amsterdam, San Francisco, Kyoto, etc. etc. As for the French being so much superior to Americans in everything . . . give me a break.As for the characters, they are caricatures, just cliches. Inez, Gil's fiancee, is a relentlessly ball busting bitch with whom Gil admits he has nothing in common, at which point we have to ask: just exactly why is he marrying her? On top of that she admits an infatuation with Paul and admits to cheating on Gil by sleeping with Paul. O . . . K . . . As for Gil, he is such a wimp! Even when he learns of this, he does nothing in retaliation to either Inez or Paul. I suppose that that is called being a superior intellect. His future in-laws are even worse cliches; the father is a crass businessman (gee, what a surprise) who cannot appreciate France's superiority on all things, and the mother is only interested in buying expensive stuff.The character of Gil is interesting only because he is a younger, blonde version of Woody Allen: the verbosity, the catty comments, the wimpiness, even some of the gestures. In a way this is a relief because if there is one thing that we do not need to see again is Allen, who nowadays looks like death warmed over, attempting to be a ladies' man.Throughout, Gil is in conflict with his fiancee; he wants to stay in Paris and thereby automatically becoming a great writer while she wants him to return to California to lead a crass commercial life. In the end, he decides to stay in Paris, whereupon he instantly meets his soulmate (gee, what a surprise).See the movie, but definitely don't buy it.",3,"See it, but don't buy it",1331683200,"03 14, 2012",2012,3100,"['very', 'good', 'side', 'movie', 'very', 'bad', 'side.Woody', 'Allen', 'made', 'very', 'good', 'movies', 'really', 'awful', 'movies', 'one', 'sides.The', 'good', 'side', 'part', 'movie', 'plot', 'charmingly', 'original', 'wannabe', 'writer', 'Gil', 'Paris', 'surrealistic', 'experience', 'ironic', 'midnight', 'back', 'Paris', '1920s', 'transported', 'gorgeous', 'car', 'die', 'who', 'who', 'intellectual', 'elite', 'time', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'Jean', 'Cocteau', 'Luis', 'Bunuel', 'Pablo', 'Picasso', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'Gertrude', 'Stein', 'T.', 'S.', 'Eliot', 'Salvador', 'Dali', 'what', 'Ezra', 'Pound', 'Here', 'Allen', 'done', 'homework', 'actors', 'portray', 'personages', 'perfectly', 'example', 'Hemingway', 'speech', 'aggressive', 'staccato', 'Dali', 'was', 'drugs', 'enthusiasm', 'Gil', 'infectious', 'costumes', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'settings', 'Paris', 'beautiful', 'city', 'especially', 'one', 'Parisians', 'whom', 'even', 'French', 'despise', 'something', 'right', 'there', '.Now', 'bad', 'side.Woody', 'Allen', 'pseudointellectual', 'who', 'put', 'down', 'other', 'pseudointellectuals', 'see', 'Gil', 'rivalry', 'Paul', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'films', 'only', 'pseudointellectual', 'would', 'think', 'living', 'Paris', 'only', 'Paris', 'will', 'automatically', 'make', 'one', 'good', 'writer', 'Hundreds', 'superb', 'writers', 'Pushkin', 'Narayan', 'Unamono', 'Poe', 'never', 'lived', 'Paris', 'Mind', 'Paris', 'beautiful', 'city', 'so', 'Florence', 'London', 'Munich', 'Amsterdam', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Kyoto', 'etc', 'etc', 'French', 'being', 'so', 'much', 'superior', 'Americans', 'everything', 'give', 'break.As', 'characters', 'are', 'caricatures', 'just', 'cliches', 'Inez', 'Gil', 'fiancee', 'relentlessly', 'ball', 'busting', 'bitch', 'whom', 'Gil', 'nothing', 'common', 'point', 'have', 'ask', 'just', 'exactly', 'why', 'marrying', 'top', 'infatuation', 'Paul', 'admits', 'cheating', 'Gil', 'sleeping', 'Paul', 'O', 'K', 'Gil', 'such', 'wimp', 'Even', 'when', 'nothing', 'retaliation', 'Inez', 'Paul', 'suppose', 'called', 'being', 'superior', 'intellect', 'future', 'in-laws', 'are', 'even', 'worse', 'cliches', 'father', 'crass', 'businessman', 'gee', 'what', 'surprise', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'appreciate', 'France', 'superiority', 'things', 'mother', 'only', 'interested', 'buying', 'expensive', 'stuff.The', 'character', 'Gil', 'interesting', 'only', 'younger', 'blonde', 'version', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'verbosity', 'catty', 'comments', 'wimpiness', 'even', 'gestures', 'way', 'relief', 'one', 'thing', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'see', 'again', 'Allen', 'who', 'death', 'warmed', 'attempting', 'be', 'ladies', 'man.Throughout', 'Gil', 'conflict', 'fiancee', 'stay', 'Paris', 'thereby', 'automatically', 'becoming', 'great', 'writer', 'return', 'California', 'lead', 'crass', 'commercial', 'life', 'end', 'stay', 'Paris', 'instantly', 'soulmate', 'gee', 'what', 'surprise', 'movie', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy']",N/A

The idea is that we have all thought of a time as being better than the present, and to be transported back would be a dream come true, to live as you would have, not the way society makes you. It was a fun, satisfying comedy, Woody Allen comedy, so not laugh out loud, but appreciative none the less. Marion Cotillard shines as the understated, beautiful muse of Picasso, you cannot help but fall in love with her. She is the epitome of Paris. Owen Wilson was his normal quirky self with wild dreams and was great throughout the film. I cannot imagine as a writer how fantastic it would be to be among some of the greatest writers/artist in history that set the scale, so to speak. At the mention of Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Dali, Matisse and T.S. Eliot, he would absolutely light up and i think this draws you in as the audience, even if you are not familiar with some of these people. I cant comment on the accuracy, but i really dont care about it either b/c it was just a movie that was not meant to be a biography, just a fun film.

Also, I ask, ""who else could have taken the same idea and made it into a movie that will last and last ?"" Woody has that facility. I am not a director nor a screenwriter. I  do believe I have a nose for a good movie from the tens of thousands of watching movie trailers, then deciding to shell out money  on the merit of the trailer. With trailers being available on-line, movie going has been easier for me and has saved my tons of  money. Enough of me!! Scanning Woody's films, I see in ""...Paris,""  flavors of ""Play It Again, Sam"", ""Radio Days"", ""Annie Hall"".  He has experience in creating the right old-time atmosphere  from ""Radio Days"", dialogue with hallucinate figures in ""Play It Again, Sam"" and the cartoon witch in ""Annie Hall"",childlike magical moments from ""Alice"", and ""Everything....about Sex"" all which I felt and analyzed from watching the trailer just onlce..  Since Woody has gone overseas after ""Hollywood Ending,""  to create Scoop, Match Point, Christina Barcelona, there has been a re-birth of untapped creativity, taken from his travel bags. This is also a new cast, without Scarlett this time. Who could have taken the same idea to form this movie... Clint? Quentin? Steven? psh psh.  Yep, this is my critique garnered from  just the trailer.Jump forward to today June 12, 2011. I just saw the movie and was quite confused at my emotions, simple and basic as they already are... the opening scenes were automatically transposed from ""Manhattan"", except now instead of Manhattan as THE EPICENTER OF THE UNIVERSE, the viewer is to thrust into the charming arms of Paris and along with the opening lines by Owen Wilson who could not hide Mr. Allen's persona leaching thru. I was pretty angry, thinking I was not supposed to see thru this ruse...

I was trance fixed into the screen and also wanted to stay there for the rest of the film. I did not want the film to end.  Midnight in Paris was more than just charming and reminiscent of his other films.  I also wanted to live in the 1920's(In Hollywood, actually. I agreed with Paul, that it is a denial of the present, but who cares?,--the feeling has always been with me. I liked it then, and Midnight in Paris, had convinced I was not wasting my time.

1494660,AT54Q2ERA4PBR,B005MYEPXC,Ben J Korgen,"[1, 1]","This movie is the story of Gil (Owen Wilson), a bored screenwriter living in California in a state of unrest about the possibility that he could become a distinguished novelist.  He simultaneously has become aware of the many writers and artists who have established their style and credibility during stays in Paris.  Dreaming of doing the same, he falls in love with Paris and with the idea that he must see Paris in the rain.  Eventually, he convinces his attractive but skeptical fianc&eacute;e Inez (Rachel McAdams) that he must go there with her and make a highly focused effort to become an established novelist.  They arrive and soon her Father (Kurt Fuller) and mother (Mimi Kennedy) arrive on one of her father's business trips.  During a dinner in Paris scheduled for sensitive, open-minded and creative Gil and her parents to get to know each other, it becomes obvious that her wealthy, conservative and fixed-belief parents (Kurt Fuller, Mimi Kennedy) clash with Gil on almost every topic that comes up.  Early on, the most sensitive viewers are almost sure to notice that in some ways, Inez is like her parents and might not be an ideal match for Gil.  After getting settled in Paris, Inez encounters friends Paul (Michael Sheen), a pedantic know-it-all who talks almost continually and Carol (Nina Arianda).  Paul and Carol invite Gil and Inez to go dancing.  Inez accepts but Gil declines.  He wants to walk the streets of Paris at night to start soaking up the atmosphere he thinks might help him find himself as a distinguished novelist.  As a Paris clock loudly chimes the hour of midnight, a large and ancient taxi drives up to Gil and an animated and happy group of drinkers invite him inside.  The taxi drops Gil and his new friends at a lively party where he realizes he has passed through a time warp and is in the presence of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and many other celebrities alive and well in the 1920s.  Gil revels in his good fortune and thinks the 1920s is the golden era he would most want to live in.  He meets and falls in love with the beautiful Adriana (Marion Cotillard) who has just broken up with Pablo Picasso.  Just when Gil decides his relationship with Inez must end and begins gushing to Adriana about his love for her and the need to be together forever, Gil and Adriana slip into a second time warp, leading to their meeting a whole new batch of celebrities of the late 1800s such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Edgar Degas.  This second time warp experience impresses Adriana and causes her to tell Gil she cannot stay with him in the 1920s because the late 1800s was the true golden age.  During daylight the next day when Gil realizes his relationships with both Inez and Adriana are over he has a sudden flash of insight telling him that there is no golden era worth striving to enter.  We live in the era into which we are born and should make the most of it.

1494661,A2NI9BFPKAFAZ0,B005MYEPXC,Blago Jones,"[0, 2]","Pros: Woody Allen's famously witty and neurotic tendencies are made more human and approachable by Owen Wilson, whose Gil is a very familiar character to the ones he's played in the past and strikes me as a good stepping stone into the world of Allen. I really appreciate the fact that this movie is a statement on this year's Academy Awards, where only one nominee for best picture is firmly grounded in the present. Allen really couldn't have picked a better year to make this into an Academy-worthy film, as its overarching theme serves to incredulously point out the irony of its inclusion in the nominees this year in particular.Cons: As much as I can appreciate most of Gil's personality, I just can't relate to his unabashed love of the city of Paris. Since I've never been there, I will admit that this might have to do with my deep-seated reactionary attitude toward all things French. But honestly, what's so great about every street, building, sign, and cobblestone in that city? Also, pretty much every character in this movie not named Gil could stand to receive a hearty punch in the face. I probably wouldn't have fared very well in the 1920s, listening to speech patterns like that all the time. Speaking of the 1920s, I felt like I could have stood to know a bit more about that generation of writers, musicians, and artists to really appreciate a good deal of the portrayals and references littered throughout the movie. Although if Hemingway reads like he spoke in this, I'm glad I haven't read his books after all.Overall: I won't say I disliked watching the movie, and there were a number of moments that made me actually laugh out loud (something I'm not typically wont to do alone in a dark room). However, I spent most of the movie wondering if it would arrive at an eventual point and whether I would care. Ultimately it did wind up with a theme that I believe ought to be quite strenuously stressed with some people, but it wasn't enough to make me think of it as anything other than a ""cute"" film that really only garners a best picture mention due to this particular year's crop of nominees.

Allen's biggest missteps in his later years have involved either casting himself as the romantic lead or casting a needed younger man but then have that man impersonate him. He needed someone who would find it virtually impossible to play Woody Allen.  He found that lead with Owen Wilson. Another huge advantage to Wilson is that gives us a mainstream American and gets Allen out of his own experiences in New York of decades ago when it was daring for him to flout convention and pick non Jewish women, most notably in his movies this was Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow.  In 2011, of course, that is a very dated riff and made him out of touch.The movie itself is a bit derivative of Allen Rudolph's MODERNS of a few decades ago which had Keith Carradine and Wally Shawn interacting with all of these same Bohemian artists and writers of 1920s Paris.  But Allen gives it his own fresh twist with the time travel aspect.Wilson being bogged down with the elitist girlfriend and her parents, all American Republicans and proud and vocal about that fact, are the only predictable element to the movie. These kinds of characters are always in his movies as anathema to the soul of the artist.Michael Sheen is unrecognizable as the pedantic Paul, an American professorial acquaintance, and does his usual marvelous acting job.

Owen Wilson often reminded me of Woody Allen in the way he delivered his crazy lines and I must admit that I was surprised that Owen Wilson could carry an entire film, appearing in almost every scene. Also note worthy are Rachel McAdams who plays his rich girlfriend. McAdams is a pretty good comedy actress and she holds her own. Marion Cotillard plays the mysterious beauty, Adriana that he meets in his journeys back into time.The film is clever as Gil goes back into time into the 1920's where he meets Scott and Zelda, Earnest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Picasso, Salvador Dali, Matisse, TS Elliot, and Man Ray.  Kathy Bates is a great Gertrude Stein and Alison Pill is superb in a cameo as Zelda. At night Gil gets into an old car that takes him back in time where he falls in love with Paris' past but during the day he runs around Paris with Inez and her conservative parents John and Helen. Mimi Kennedy is perfect as the white upper class conservative American woman. Gil is going through writer's block as she struggles to begin and novel.

It follows Gil (Owen Wilson) and his fianc&eacute;e Inez (Rachel McAdams) on their holiday in Paris. Both Wilson and McAdams played their parts fantastically: McAdams plays a beautiful and spoilt, all-American blonde who is exasperated by Gil's romantic and fantastical musings and Wilson plays a whimsical Hollywood script writer,who is desperate to escape America and move to Paris to become a successful novelist.Wilson plays the Woody Allen protagonist wonderfully, capturing Allen's signature neurotic intelligence without becoming a cheap imitation of his acting. From the outset is it obvious the two characters are a mismatch and Gil soon leaves Inez' company to go on solitary late-night walks through Paris. As the clock strikes midnight, a vintage car pulls up and he is transported back to his favourite era, the 1920s. He meets all the major artists of the period: the Fitzgerald's have fantastic energy and Allen's depictions of Ernest Hemingway and Salvador Dali are hilarious.I loved the lavish and indulgent, nostalgic celebration of the 1920's complete with jazz music, beautiful dresses and wild partying. Marion Cottilard, the 'art-groupy', loved by Hemingway and Picasso is beautiful and captivating, perfectly suited to the glamour of the 1920s.

The casting is marvelous as Owen Wilson as a man, Gil Pender, who glorifies 1920 Paris and all the literary greats who at one time or another, lived there. While in Paris on a midnight stroll at the stroke of midnight, a car shows up and takes him to a most extraordinary party, in attendance are The Fitzgeralds (Zelda and Scott) and Cole Porter who belts out tunes at the piano. Gil Pender is a screenwriter wannabe novelist who would rather live and work in an attic office in Paris than marry and move to Malibu like his snotty fiance, Inez (Rachel McAdams) would prefer and this party blows him away. Later he meets, (an amazing likeness of) Ernest Hemmingway, Gertrude Stein, and Picasso. He also rubs elbows with Dali, who is magnificently played by Adrian Brody (my favorite part of the film) and many other artists and writers from the 1920s. Woody Allen has created a work of genius in this understated film.As Gil's personal relationships grows with the greats of the past, he comes to some realizations of his present life. For a while he bounces back and forth between his current vacation in Paris and Paris in the Golden Age. This is really a neat film and if you enjoy stories of such as A Moveable Feast, you will really enjoy this lighthearted comedy.I enjoyed all of the performances in the movie and found the cast to be amazing and the script first rate.

1494687,A3DD96LN8U1NM,B005MYEPXC,citygal,"[0, 0]","This review contains some spoilers:What I liked about the movie:1) This really is a ""feel good movie,"" and I would probably watch it again. It has a happy ending.2) I enjoyed the time travel aspect of it, especially the era of the past on which it focused (the 1920s----love the music, fashion, etc.)3) Despite how cliche and unrealistic it was (see #1 in the next list), I liked the scenery. The scenery fulfills most Americans' romantic ideas of what Paris should look/be like.4) I enjoyed laughing at Paul, the pedantic character. (Don't we all know somebody like him?).  The scene where he argues with the tour guide is priceless!5) I liked the art/literary allusions; watching this felt kind of like a movie version of Jeopardy where I kept trying to identify the characters and allusions.The film's problems:1) The film is rife with cliches:  From the protagonists' obsession with walking in the rain to the overly romanticized portrayal of Paris to the in-your-face personalities of some of the famous writers & artists, parts of the movie lacked originality. (Perhaps Allen was trying to portray Paris in the overly romanticized way that Gil sees it??).2) The conspicuous yet confusing treatment of the theme. We are almost hit over the head with the movie's ""message"" toward the end. However, the epiphany Gil has about overly romanticizing the past is confusing as ""the"" theme for the movie since the pedantic character expresses the same view and we're meant to think he's a jerk.  So is Allen trying to say that we tend to romanticize the past and shouldn't or not?3) The caricature-like portrayal of the bratty fiance and her conservative Republican parents (of course, being Hollywood, it's almost a given that the bad guys will be Republicans/conservatives).  This, like the theme, could have been handled with a defter hand. Because of how superficial Inez was, I found it hard to believe that she and Gil would ever have gotten engaged. That made the entire basis of them being in Paris unrealistic for me.I think all the actors did a good job.  I disagree with some reviewers who believe Wilson's performance was dry.

From the first impressionistic moments showing a multitude of  Parisian city scenes I was utterly sucked into the heart of this film where I remained for its entire duration, completely entranced.  The Woody Allen I have always loved is back, and for me, this is without question his finest film and his finest writing!  I attended university in the 1970's and was thoroughly steeped in the prose of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and others of their era.  I read them, read about them, and ended up with a familiarity that left me feeling as if  I had lived among them in that era myself.  Having also spent a year in France with much time in Paris, I have such nostalgia for that time in my life and what I experienced there as part of my own expat community of the time.  Hence my initial interest in this film, which did not disappoint on any level.  I have always liked Owen Wilson, but I do believe this is his finest performance to date.  He was perfect in every way, and best of all, he played the role of Gil exquisitely without being Woody Allen in disguise, quite a feat, actually.  Owen was himself, his performance was somewhat muted yet poignant, and this was his best role ever and one of which he should be proud.  The casting of Corey Stoll as Hemingway and Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein in particular were standouts for me as the embodiments of how my youthful imagination envisioned those larger than life characters.  The fantasy aspect of the story in which Gil travels back through time to meet these characters is never an issue in believability, it simply ""is"".  Rather, the joy of the story is in the words of the various characters as they relate to each other, and Woody's script is beautifully and memorably written.  I enjoyed every moment of the film and did not want it to be over.

1494694,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B005MYEPXC,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[1, 1]","One of the most productive and sought after directors (by actors), Woody Allen, has made dozens of films that deal with the often turbulent relationships between men and women.  Almost exclusively a New Yorker by heart, Allen has begun a renaissance of sorts with his exploration of European settings in particular Paris, France, and although his films of the past decade have varied in quality, his latest, Midnight in Paris, is a standout and represents the writer/director at the top of his game.Opening with a spectacular collage of vignettes, Paris never looked more enticing or romantic (Manhattan redux).  At the fabled Giverny, Monet's source of inspiration, an American couple, Gil (Owen Wilson) and Inez (Rachel McAdams) are engaged to be married and yet squabble constantly.  An idealist, He is smitten by the culture and history of Paris, and one night while strolling the streets alone, a vintage car drives by and gives him a ride to a caf&eacute;.  Gil realizes that he has been transported to 1920's Paris and is mingling with the celebrities of its heyday including some famous American ex-patriots like Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and F. Scott Fitzgerald.  Gil is struggling with a novel and needs some advice, so who better than Gertrude Stein (amusingly played by Kathy Bates) to critique the manuscript? Upon his return to present day Paris, Gil wonders if it was all a dream but the scene repeats itself the next evening at midnight when he meets Pablo Picasso and the beautiful Adriana (Marion Cotillard), who captures Gil's fancy.  Thinking that Gil has lost his mind, Inez begins to show interest in another male friend. Meanwhile Gil is obsessed with Adriana, and as the couple visits the Moulin Rouge, they find themselves transported to an even earlier, romantic period in French history. Gil finds that Adriana has her own ideas about life, and he is about to find true love in the unlikeliest of places.This is Allen in high gear and, though it does not necessarily rank among his best, it certainly is a throwback to his vintage period of Manhattan and the film that this will be most compared to The Purple Rose of Cairo, with its similar combination of wistful fantasy, storybook romance, and sophisticated comedy.  You do wonder how Gil and Inez could ever become a couple considering how much they bicker about most everything.  It's also interesting how Allen uses a bit of sleight of hand by focusing our attention on Gil and Adriana that we miss an obvious connection.  Such is love.Gil is a surrogate for Allen's inner voice. (One could even picture a younger Allen actually performing the role.)  He is also a romantic in contrast to Inez's friends who are intellectuals.  As for Paris, it plays a supporting role as its landmarks are adoringly featured throughout the film without detracting from the characters or story.  It is clear Allen is smitten with the City of Lights as he was with his home base of New York City.There are some amusing scenes including the fate of a private investigator hired to follow Gil and ends up caught up in a different time running for his life. When Gil listens to old Cole Porter recordings or sees Picasso paintings in a museum, the joke is that he actually has met these men in real life! In another scene, Gil suggests to a young director, Luis Bunuel, a film idea which is the plot to The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie that he will make many years later (and win an Oscar). As Salvador Dali, Adrien Brody hams it up to great effect in a brief scene.Sure Allen has made some good films recently like Match Point and Vicky Cristina Barcelona, but it's been a long while since he made anything as imaginative, comedic, and romantic at the same time.

Woody Allen should stop churning out a movie a year.  He should instead focus on making great films as they come to him.  The new yearly, European excursion to be inflicted upon audiences is Midnight in Paris.  A man of the twenty-first century longs for the golden years of Paris in the 1920s.  The rain, the city, and the writers and artists are just too good to not want to join.  And Gil gets his wish, every night at midnight.The whimsical story of a time travel is rather funny and cute.  The Fitzgeralds, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Picasso, and so many others offer a fanciful cast of characters for Gil to interact with and react to.  In fact, the best the film has to offer is Gil's boyish wonderment and fascination with everything going on.  Owen Wilson is superb.  His facial expressions are priceless.  It is a rather simple movie with a simple plot, but the magic of Gil's travels back in time and his child-like wonderment is a treat.  Adrian Brody is hilarious as Dali, he really steals the scene.The acting for the rest of the cast seems heavy-handed.  Inez is annoying; painfully so.  Her parents and friends are so pretentious it's difficult to watch them.  It's almost as if Allen is writing and directing for audiences he thinks are too dense to get it.  Or he is writing about people that are just unbearable.If you can suffer through the ""present day"" scenes, the golden age of Paris in the 1920s is good for a delightful laugh.",3,"Formulaic and predictable, but Owen Wilson makes it enjoyable",1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,1577,"['miss', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'films', 'yesteryear', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanors', 'Manhattan', 'Murder', 'Mystery', 'so', 'forth', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'should', 'stop', 'churning', 'out', 'movie', 'year', 'should', 'instead', 'focus', 'making', 'great', 'films', 'come', 'new', 'yearly', 'European', 'excursion', 'be', 'inflicted', 'audiences', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'man', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'longs', 'golden', 'years', 'Paris', '1920s', 'rain', 'city', 'writers', 'artists', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'good', 'not', 'want', 'join', 'Gil', 'wish', 'night', 'midnight.The', 'whimsical', 'story', 'time', 'travel', 'rather', 'funny', 'cute', 'Fitzgeralds', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'Gertrude', 'Stein', 'Picasso', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'offer', 'fanciful', 'cast', 'characters', 'Gil', 'interact', 'react', 'fact', 'best', 'film', 'offer', 'Gil', 'boyish', 'wonderment', 'fascination', 'everything', 'going', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'superb', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'priceless', 'rather', 'simple', 'movie', 'simple', 'plot', 'magic', 'Gil', 'travels', 'back', 'time', 'child-like', 'wonderment', 'treat', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'hilarious', 'Dali', 'really', 'scene.The', 'acting', 'rest', 'cast', 'heavy-handed', 'Inez', 'annoying', 'painfully', 'so', 'parents', 'friends', 'are', 'so', 'pretentious', 'difficult', 'watch', 'almost', 'Allen', 'writing', 'directing', 'audiences', 'are', 'too', 'dense', 'get', 'writing', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'can', 'suffer', 'present', 'day', 'scenes', 'golden', 'age', 'Paris', '1920s', 'good', 'delightful', 'laugh']",N/A

1494699,AN94T2DI0XV0R,B005MYEPXC,"Daniel Edward Neff ""Author""","[2, 3]","Let me begin by stating that I enjoyed this movie. I would encourage anyone who is interested in the arts (literature, painting, etc.) to see Midnight in Paris. It is a lovely romantic drama that provides an escape from our hectic workaday life.The film opens with a montage of scenes of modern-day Paris, with music of the 1920s playing in the background, which seems just a little too long. The scenes are beautiful and the music hearkens back to a simpler, more romantic time, but the montage just went on too long.The juxtaposition between modern day and Paris in the 1920s (Gil's ideal or Golden Age) was too vague. One of the main themes of the movie is Gil's longing for meaning in his writing career and nostalgia for the Golden Age (the good old days, Paris in the 1920s). For me, there was no difference in the feel of the modern day he magically escapes from and the period he is transported back to: just different clothes and technology and architecture. The film would have been more powerful if more of the ills of modern society (which every generation believes did not exist in the ""good old days"") were portrayed. The world which the main characters move through seems just as carefree and luxurious as the Golden Age which Gil longs for.There is, however, a nice lesson in the film, learned by the characters, that the good old days were not necessarily so good to those who lived through them and that every generation longs for a simpler, better time.The point at which Gil realizes that all these individuals (whom he believes at first to be modern people playing dress up and acting the part of characters from the Golden Age) are actually the real, living Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, etc. should be a defining and poignant moment in the film, yet it passes imperceptibly. One moment we know that Gil thinks he is in modern Paris, and then we realize Gil is convinced the characters are real, yet his demeanor and behavior don't really change. I don't know if this is a weakness in Owen Wilson's acting or the fault of the director/producer, but I never experienced that wonder that a person would experience when they realize,""This is not a dream, these are not quirky actors playing a trick on the public, I am really talking to literary and artistic giants who have been dead for many years."" I LOVE Owen Wilson, I'm just not sure he was the best choice for this role. His normal expression when the room is on fire is the same one he shows when he realizes he is in the company of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.Allison Pill as Zelda Fitzgerald stole the show. I felt like I was watching the real Zelda Fitzgerald. In contrast, Corey Stoll's performance as Ernest Hemingway was not very good, in my opinion. He  seemed to be a caricature of Hemingway. I felt like I was watching an actor trying to playing Hemingway. Kathy Bates turns in a terrific performance as Gertrude Stein.Having said all that, let me say I did enjoy this movie. I think anyone who is a writer or artist, or enjoys literature and art, will enjoy this movie. I would not laud it as one of the best movies of all time, but I would consider it one of the best movies of the last few years.I recommend (and this is a compliment about the movie) having your laptop at the ready to Google characters and book references if you are not extremely well-read in regards to the authors, artists, and influential figures in the artistic community in Paris in the 1920s (e.g. Gertrude Stein, Jean Cocteau, etc.).I guess in conclusion, I felt like the premise was so good, and there was so much potential in the idea, that I was disappointed in the final product which the producers produced. I had completely forgotten until I was finishing this review that Midnight in Paris was directed by Woody Allen. I'm sure that many people who rave over this movie have fallen into the trap of looking at art subjectively. Whether it is movies or books, we often tend to give more credit to the work of an artist who has produced great works in the past than the current individual piece deserves.P.S.I gave this movie 4 stars, but I really wanted to give it 3 1/2 stars. The rating won't allow half stars, and I felt 3 out of 5 would have been insufficient. This is better than an average movie (3 stars), but I'm not sure it is 4 out of 5.",4,A Pretty Good Movie That Should Have Been Great,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,4347,"['Let', 'begin', 'stating', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'would', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'arts', 'literature', 'painting', 'etc', 'see', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'lovely', 'romantic', 'drama', 'escape', 'hectic', 'workaday', 'life.The', 'film', 'montage', 'scenes', 'modern-day', 'Paris', 'music', '1920s', 'playing', 'background', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'scenes', 'are', 'beautiful', 'music', 'back', 'simpler', 'more', 'romantic', 'time', 'montage', 'just', 'went', 'too', 'long.The', 'juxtaposition', 'modern', 'day', 'Paris', '1920s', 'Gil', 'ideal', 'Golden', 'Age', 'was', 'too', 'vague', 'One', 'main', 'themes', 'movie', 'Gil', 'longing', 'meaning', 'writing', 'career', 'nostalgia', 'Golden', 'Age', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'Paris', '1920s', 'was', 'difference', 'feel', 'modern', 'day', 'magically', 'period', 'transported', 'back', 'just', 'different', 'clothes', 'technology', 'architecture', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'powerful', 'more', 'ills', 'modern', 'society', 'generation', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'were', 'portrayed', 'world', 'main', 'characters', 'move', 'just', 'carefree', 'luxurious', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Gil', 'longs', 'for.There', 'however', 'nice', 'lesson', 'film', 'learned', 'characters', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'were', 'not', 'necessarily', 'so', 'good', 'who', 'lived', 'generation', 'longs', 'simpler', 'better', 'time.The', 'point', 'Gil', 'individuals', 'whom', 'first', 'be', 'modern', 'people', 'playing', 'dress', 'up', 'acting', 'part', 'characters', 'Golden', 'Age', 'are', 'actually', 'real', 'living', 'Scott', 'Zelda', 'Fitzgerald', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'etc', 'should', 'be', 'defining', 'poignant', 'moment', 'film', 'imperceptibly', 'One', 'moment', 'know', 'Gil', 'modern', 'Paris', 'then', 'realize', 'Gil', 'convinced', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'yet', 'demeanor', 'behavior', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'change', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'weakness', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'acting', 'fault', 'director/producer', 'never', 'experienced', 'wonder', 'person', 'would', 'experience', 'when', 'realize', 'not', 'dream', 'are', 'not', 'quirky', 'actors', 'playing', 'trick', 'public', 'am', 'really', 'talking', 'literary', 'artistic', 'giants', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'dead', 'many', 'years', 'LOVE', 'Owen', 'Wilson', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'best', 'choice', 'role', 'normal', 'expression', 'when', 'room', 'fire', 'same', 'one', 'when', 'company', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway.Allison', 'Pill', 'Zelda', 'Fitzgerald', 'stole', 'show', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'real', 'Zelda', 'Fitzgerald', 'contrast', 'Corey', 'Stoll', 'performance', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'opinion', 'seemed', 'be', 'caricature', 'Hemingway', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'actor', 'trying', 'playing', 'Hemingway', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Gertrude', 'Stein.Having', 'said', 'let', 'say', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'writer', 'artist', 'literature', 'art', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'laud', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'time', 'would', 'consider', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'last', 'few', 'years.I', 'recommend', 'compliment', 'movie', 'having', 'laptop', 'ready', 'Google', 'characters', 'book', 'references', 'are', 'not', 'extremely', 'well-read', 'regards', 'authors', 'artists', 'influential', 'figures', 'artistic', 'community', 'Paris', '1920s', 'e.g', 'Gertrude', 'Stein', 'Jean', 'Cocteau', 'etc', '.I', 'guess', 'conclusion', 'felt', 'premise', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'there', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'idea', 'was', 'disappointed', 'final', 'product', 'producers', 'produced', 'had', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'was', 'finishing', 'review', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'was', 'directed', 'Woody', 'Allen', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'rave', 'movie', 'have', 'fallen', 'trap', 'looking', 'art', 'subjectively', 'movies', 'books', 'often', 'tend', 'give', 'more', 'credit', 'work', 'artist', 'who', 'produced', 'great', 'works', 'past', 'current', 'individual', 'piece', 'deserves.P.S.I', 'gave', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'really', 'wanted', 'give', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'rating', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'half', 'stars', 'felt', '3', '5', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'insufficient', 'better', 'average', 'movie', '3', 'stars', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', '4', '5']",N/A

Part fantasy, party romantic comedy, and all parts good, Woody Allen directs a masterpiece that I've watched several times. Those more literate viewers will appreciate the references and wit from characters including Ernest Hemingway, Dal&iacute;, and Bu&ntilde;uel, among others who populate this piece. Owen Wilson rises above to embody the essential Allen angst in ways I never thought possible. Wilson delivers a performance that I can't imagine anyone else giving. Essentially, the plot revolves around Wilson and his fianc&eacute; in Paris, tagging along with her parents who are on a business trip, and weird things ensue when Wilson's character takes a ride into the past to meet his literary heroes. Although Wilson's character is successful at writing screenplays, he's struggling with a novel. He learns life lessons in various visits to the past where he encounters the aforementioned literary and artistic giants, all of whom have something to say in outrageously entertaining fashion. Furthermore, the &#34;look&#34; of this film is pure eye candy, a saturated glow to the past and a crisp look at the present will resonate after many viewings.

So it was only natural for me to want to see Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris.  Without a doubt, Mr. Allen loves Paris. It is clear from the opening minutes when we are transported to all of the familiar spots in Paris.  Owen Wilson gives a splendid performance as Gil, a screenwriter who desperately wants to write novels.  After Gil's first time travel episode, meeting the likes of F.Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald and Cole Porter I found myself looking forward to his nightly travels into the past.  Rather than writing clich&eacute;-ridden dialogue for his famous characters, the conversations are very natural.  Perhaps the most memorable and humorous performance goes to Adrian Brody as Salvador Dali.Midnight in Paris is a romantic comedy, with Gil on the verge of marrying the wrong woman (nicely played by Rachel McAdams).  Gil wants to show her why Paris is such a special place and she wants to go shopping.  Midnight in Paris is a charming, funny and thought provoking film that certainly was a hit with the audience when I saw it.If you love Paris, then you owe it to yourself to see the new Woody Allen film.",5,A Charming Film,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,1237,"['have', 'admit', 'have', 'always', 'thought', '1920', 'Paris', 'golden', 'time', 'ideal', 'time', 'be', 'City', 'Light', 'was', 'only', 'natural', 'want', 'see', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'doubt', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'Paris', 'clear', 'opening', 'minutes', 'when', 'are', 'transported', 'familiar', 'spots', 'Paris', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'splendid', 'performance', 'Gil', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'desperately', 'write', 'novels', 'Gil', 'first', 'time', 'travel', 'episode', 'meeting', 'likes', 'F.Scott', 'Zelda', 'Fitzgerald', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'found', 'looking', 'forward', 'nightly', 'past', 'Rather', 'writing', 'clich', 'eacute', '-ridden', 'dialogue', 'famous', 'characters', 'conversations', 'are', 'very', 'natural', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'memorable', 'humorous', 'performance', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'Salvador', 'Dali.Midnight', 'Paris', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Gil', 'verge', 'marrying', 'wrong', 'woman', 'nicely', 'played', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'Gil', 'show', 'why', 'Paris', 'such', 'special', 'place', 'go', 'shopping', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'charming', 'funny', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'certainly', 'was', 'hit', 'audience', 'when', 'saw', 'it.If', 'love', 'Paris', 'then', 'owe', 'yourself', 'see', 'new', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film']",N/A

I'll go on record and say that ""Annie Hall"" is the most overrated film of all time.  When he's brilliant he produces great work like ""Manhattan"", ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and ""Mighty Aphrodite"".  When he indulges himself you get ""Celebrity"" and ""Melinda and Melinda"".  ""Midnight in Paris"" is neither great or self-indulgent.  It's a nice little fantasy with a message which is the time you have foisted on you is the best of times.  Allen is careful not to beat the message into the ground.  Allen makes Paris as sumptuous and exciting as he did in prior films for his beloved New York.  Owen Wilson as a scriptwriter who dreams of being a novelist does admirable work.  He serves as a kind of a surrogate of Allen's but he doesn't make the mistake of trying to impersonate him.  The weak link is probably the portrayal of the historic figures Wilson's Gil meets in his foray to the past who are little more than wax figures.  It's a bit of a shock becuase they are portrayed by an array of good actors.

Young Owen Wilson has the lead role, plays the part of a writer with girlfriend problems and job problems...all comic ones...same as Woody when he used to star in his own movies.Documentary part of the DVD I got shows Woody at a press conference in 2011 at Cannes, and his looks very fragile and unhealthy...his skin is very yellow and pasty looking, and one eye looks bad, like a man who had a stroke...and his speech isn't clear at times......but...he keeps on going like old man river.He really is one of the great figures in cinema....like D. W. Griffith, I think. I met him face to face in NYC in 1972 at a place where he played his clarinet several times weekly with the house jazz band...called ""Michael's Pub"" as I remember. I was living in Manhattan then, selling educational movies....had a jazzy apt. in the easy 60's near the place where Woody played...went to see him one afternoon with a girlfriend who knew about it. He talked about the Mets baseball team.Woody is very important...made 41 films since TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN in 1968......

The film would mark Allen's first film to go through a digital intermediate and literally an experiment to find out if he would like to use the process in his next films.""Midnight in Paris"" is a film that focuses on Gil (played by Owen Wilson, ""Wedding Crashers"", ""The Darjeeling Limited"", ""Bottle Rocket""), a Hollywood screenwriter who has traveled with his fiancee, Inez (played by Rachel McAdams, ""Wedding Crashers"", ""Mean Girls"", ""Sherlock Holmes"") and her wealthy and conservative parents to Paris.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Midnight in Paris"" is presented in 1:85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen and presented in English and French 3.0 LCR (Discrete Surround). Woody Allen's goal to capture the beauty of Paris was successful!  Darius Khondji and Johanne Debas did a fantastic job in capturing these breathtaking scenes of the Parisian streets, various locations and for the most part, everything looks good on DVD.But if anyone wants to experience the best picture and audio quality, you definitely want to watch this movie on Blu-ray!  In fact, while I was watching this film on DVD, I kept telling myself of how beautiful those scenes would look in HD!Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Midnight in Paris"" comes with the following special features:Midnight in Cannes - (4:57) Featuring excerpts of the Cannes Film Festival press conference as Woody Allen and cast talk about filming in Paris and working on the film.Theatrical Trailer - (2:05) The original theatrical trailer for ""Midnight in Paris"".JUDGMENT CALL:Delightful, clever and witty... Woody Allen serves up a wonderful romantic comedy with ""Midnight in Paris"" and yet another fantastic  film to add to his amazing oeuvre.When it comes to Woody Allen, you just never know what you're going to get with his films, especially within the last 20-years.  Many film critics have wondered if the filmmaker has lost his magic that he exhibited earlier in his career but I have always watched his films, past and present and have enjoyed them.  Sure, the older films have a style, an allure, to them that emits ""classic"" Woody Allen filmmaking and one that many have hoped to see again.With ""Midnight in Paris"", although Allen doesn't star in the film, fortunately Owen Wilson manages to tap into a Woody persona and are able to achieve an efficacy of Woody Allen magic.  Romantic, witty and absolute charming, ""Midnight in Paris"" is a film that captivated me from beginning to end and it was a film that I enjoyed tremendously.When it comes to capturing romance in the city, may it be bleak or happy, may it be in New York, London or Barcelona, how perfect would it be for Allen to capture a romantic comedy in Paris?And he does it with ""Midnight in Paris"".  From its opening breathtaking scenes of the famous areas of the city, I was captivated from the start.But its the characters that made me love this movie and it's also the clever insight to those characters that I found delightful.  Owen Wilson does a remarkable job of playing Gil, the writer seeking inspiration but its that creative desire that he gets from Paris that gives him vitality.  Vitality that runs counter to the lost energy he gets when he's around his fiance Inez.Inez plays the soul sucking fiance.  Not so supportive of her fiance, despite having knowledge of art, poetry and literary work, she would rather listen to her friend Paul, a wannabe verite that is pompous and your typical Mr. Know-it-All, or more like he thinks he knows it all.But it's when we see the fantasy element of Woody Allen's film start to take shape, of how we see the creative Gil finding inspiration by returning to what he thinks is the Golden Year of creativity, the 1920's.  The time of the Lost Generation and for anyone who are avid readers, those who follow poetry, art and cinema...one can easily ask themselves, how would it have been to have an association, friendship with the talents of Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, Cole Porter, Gertrude Stein, etc.To use the words of Ernest Hemingway from his memoir ""A Moveable Feast"", ""If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast"".What would one do if you had the chance to go back in time, France ala 1920's and to associate with these individuals?This is where ""Midnight in Paris"" becomes charming and fun, and as I watched, I watched with a big grin because we see the character of Gil, the classic Woody Allen character, getting that opportunity. There is no focus on how Gil is able to go back in time, all that matters is that he is with people that understand him, people from a Lost Generation which he has looked at as ""The Golden Years"" for those individuals he had respected.And because of this,  the use of these famous figures and Gil's interaction with them may be pleasing to an audience or may go over their heads of why one would find certain situations funny or hilarious.While ""Midnight in Paris"" by no means does one have to be an erudite of their work to enjoy the film, it does make things a bit more intriguing if you do.  From the relationships between Hemingway and Gertrude Stein or Hemingway with the Fitzgerald's or Picasso's many mistresses, I loved how the film touched upon those little things.  But its not necessary to understand them.  For example, the woman that Gil starts to fall for...Adriana, is a fictional character.  A mistress of Picasso who loves couture, who is interested in Gil (as Gil has interest in her) but because he is engaged to Inez, how will his time with Adriana change him?As for little details that I found intriguing, you see Gil visiting the bookstore ""Shakespeare & Company"". The significance is that its a bookstore that Hemingway would visit and read various books that inspired him.One of the most hilarious parts of the film, which fans of filmmaker Luis Bunuel would be interested in, is a scene where Gil is offering a filmmaking idea.Gil:  Mr. Bunuel, I have a nice idea for a movie for you?Luis: Yes?Gil: A group of people attend a formal dinner party and at the dinner, when they try to leave the room, they can't.Luis: Why not?Gil: They just can't just seem to exit the door?Luis: But...But why?Gil: Well...Momento.  When they are forced to stay together, the veneer of civilization quickly fades away and what you are left with is... who they real are...animals.Luis: But I don't get it, why don't they just walk out of the room?Gil: All I am asking is for you to think about it.  Who knows, when you are shaving one day, it may tickle your fancy.Luis: I don't understand...what is holding them in the room?While possibly this discussion may go over the heads of most audiences, for cinema fans, one can only grin as Gil is talking about Bunuel's Academy Award winning surrealist film from 1972, ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"".So, there are small details that I just found delightful and fun, and with the whole film shot in Paris and having that touristy but yet enchanting flair, I couldn't help but enjoy the beauty of the film and enjoy the film and see the journey of Gil and how Paris changes him.As for the DVD, I think ""Midnight in Paris"" actually breaks new ground.  I believe this is the first Woody Allen film to include a special feature.  It's generally known and mentioned in many other reviews that Woody Allen is not a big fan of special features and with each release, all you are getting is a trailer.  But with this DVD (and possibly for the Blu-ray release), you get a four minute special feature from the Cannes press conference for ""Midnight in Paris"".  Sure, it's short but take what you can get Woody Allen fans, the fact that there is a special feature aside from the trailer is actually surprising.While the DVD is a very solid release, if you have a Blu-ray player, this is one of those films that features beautiful scenery that you want to watch it on HD.  This is a very entertaining film that is worth watching on Blu-ray but otherwise, if you don't have a Blu-ray player and don't plan to get one, then the DVD is very good!Overall, ""Midnight in Paris"" is a fantastic Woody Allen film, especially those familiar with the famous figures presented in the film.  But a beautiful, delightful and fun film that is definitely recommended!",5,"Delightful, clever and witty...

1494713,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B005MYEPXC,Doug Anderson,"[10, 12]","Woody's heroes/heroines are the romantics of all epics, eternally uncertain of themselves & their place in the world (so he loves F. Scott & Zelda); but here he also professes admiration for the clear-sighted who offer advice to the lost romantics among us (so he loves Hemingway & Stein as well); and there's even a passing nod of recognition to the unhinged (Dali, Bunuel, Man Ray).His villains are those who use intellect or artistic talent as a weapon of seduction or social dominance. And American pragmatism/materialism that seems designed to alienate us from our finer qualities.With Midnight in Paris, Woody Allen continues his critique of American identity/aspirations. Like Henry James, he finds it easiest to study Americans when they are in foreign locales. But all of the old themes are here as well (underconfident romantic up against overconfident poser; romantic/artistic disappointment tempered by humor; bittersweet Chaplinesque ending).The only thing that makes the 70's Woody Allen films (Annie Hall, Manhattan) better than the current series (Match Point, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Midnight in Paris) is the absence of Woody Allen. This was not as noticable with Vicky Cristina Barcelona because the leads were female, but here its almost impossible not to imagine a younger Woody doing all of his signature things with this role.

He directs this film, but he has a way of having his actors sound and act just like him! This is no exception. Owen Wilson plays a rather brow-beaten fiancee to a spoiled, domineering, pseudo-intellectual woman who is more than self-centered. The usual ideas of living better in a different time, with no time being the best, is a theme her that helps Wilson's character find true love in another century, but most importantly, in the present. Allen's themes of class differences and shallow self-indulgent people are clear. Wilson is a would be writer who wants desperately to finish a book, or anything for that matter.

Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[0, 0]","Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris"" is a comedic fantasy about a Hollywood screenwriter, Gil Pender, (Owen Wilson) who yearns to be a novelist based in Paris.  However, he is engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams), a beautiful but shallow woman who wants to live the good life in Malibu.  Adding to the tension, Inez's parents are less than thrilled with their daughter's choice of fianc&eacute;; they are convinced that Gil is beneath her.  When the young couple piggybacks along on a business trip to Paris along with Inez's parents, the City of Lights once again casts its magic spell.Much to Gil's shock, when the clock strikes midnight, he is invited into a vintage car and is spirited away to the 1920s, where he is stunned and delighted to meet such luminaries as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates at her most wonderful), Picasso, Dali, and Adriana, played by the luminescent Marion Cotillard.  Gil even has an opportunity to discuss life and literature with a smug Ernest Hemingway.Allen has created a cinematic love letter to a place that he obviously adores.  He wisely never explains the fantasy elements, but encourages us to sit back and enjoy the humor and romance.  Since this is a souffl&eacute; that could have easily fallen flat, Allen wisely maintains a light touch throughout.  Allen's theme, that we can never be happy unless we are true to ourselves, is delivered unobtrusively.  The cast, led by an ingenuous and earnest Owen Wilson, with cameo appearances by actors who are obviously having a ball, is uniformly excellent.

1494722,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B005MYEPXC,Ed Uyeshima,"[12, 21]","Woody Allen's 2011 contribution to cinema has been heralded as a return to form by many critics, and for a few shining moments at the outset, it looks like it might just that as well be that way. Through a lovely montage of Parisian images by cinematographer Darius Khondji, Allen evokes the city's unabashed romanticism set to Sidney Bechet's nocturnally soulful saxophone on his composition ""Si Tu Vois Ma Mere"" much the same way the filmmaker captured the cosmopolitan energy of Manhattan set to Gershwin's grandiose ""Rhapsody in Blue"" in his1979 masterwork. The camera finally lands on the lead characters as they visit Claude Monet's picture-perfect gardens at Giverny. From there, Allen treads familiar territory following the adventures of Gil Pender, Allen's alter-ego, a successful but unfulfilled Hollywood screenwriter on a trip to Paris with his fianc&eacute;e Inez along with her wealthy, xenophobic parents who are funding the trip with typical bourgeoisie disdain.Longing to join the literary ranks of his heroes F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, Gil, we discover, is working on his first novel much to Inez's chagrin. Enamored with the way Paris was during the 1920's, Gil soon finds himself in an alternate universe after midnight where he is rubbing elbows over martinis at jazz clubs with not only Fitzgerald and Hemingway but also influential figures like Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Cole Porter, and Salvador Dali. By the light of day, however, he faces the mundane reality of Inez and her family, who are completely indifferent to his flights of fancy. Matters get worse when Gil and Inez bump into Paul, an old college crush of hers, who has since become the type of intolerable pedant Allen skewered so well in the movie theater scene inAnnie Hall. Gil - as he toggles between present-day Paris and his idealized vision of the city's past - will likely remind Allen's fans of the shenanigans that occurred in ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" down to the introduction of an out-of-sync love interest, this time a beautiful clothing designer named Adriana, who was Modigliani's mistress and has now become Picasso's embattled lover. Allen obviously enjoys regaling in Jazz Age-era Paris and presumes his viewers will have more than a passing familiarity with the period.When I saw the Steins Collect at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art this past summer, I received an in-depth primer on some of these seminal figures. You can tell Allen is less interested in the contemporary scenes, which are not as arresting with these characters coming across more like stereotypes despite a game cast. As the hapless Gil, Owen Wilson is a bit improbable as a writer with high literary aspirations, but his sincerity in the role helps win us over. Back inMean Girlsmode, Rachel McAdams isn't given that much to do as Inez except to express constant frustration. Usually playing sincere historical figures like Tony Blair and David Frost, Michael Sheen has a field day as the entirely unlikeable Paul. There's a predictably no-nonsense turn by Kathy Bates as Stein and an over-the-top one by Adrian Brody as Dali. As Scott and Zelda, Tom Hiddleston (the malevolent Loki inThor) and especially Alison Pill play their archetypes quite well, but among the real-life figures, Corey Stoll stands out as the pugnacious Hemingway. As Adriana, Marion Cotillard makes the most of her fantasy figure role. All in all, this is solid work from Allen but still a fair distance from his most accomplished.",3,Allen Finds Another Purple Rose in Paris,1322092800,"11 24, 2011",2011,3510,"['Woody', 'Allen', '2011', 'contribution', 'cinema', 'been', 'heralded', 'return', 'form', 'many', 'critics', 'few', 'shining', 'moments', 'outset', 'might', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'way', 'lovely', 'montage', 'Parisian', 'images', 'cinematographer', 'Darius', 'Khondji', 'Allen', 'city', 'unabashed', 'romanticism', 'set', 'Sidney', 'Bechet', 'nocturnally', 'soulful', 'saxophone', 'composition', 'Si', 'Tu', 'Vois', 'Ma', 'Mere', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'filmmaker', 'captured', 'cosmopolitan', 'energy', 'Manhattan', 'set', 'Gershwin', 'grandiose', 'Rhapsody', 'Blue', 'his1979', 'masterwork', 'camera', 'finally', 'lead', 'characters', 'visit', 'Claude', 'Monet', 'picture-perfect', 'gardens', 'Giverny', 'there', 'Allen', 'familiar', 'territory', 'following', 'adventures', 'Gil', 'Pender', 'Allen', 'alter-ego', 'successful', 'unfulfilled', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriter', 'trip', 'Paris', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Inez', 'wealthy', 'xenophobic', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'funding', 'trip', 'typical', 'bourgeoisie', 'disdain.Longing', 'join', 'literary', 'ranks', 'heroes', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'Gil', 'discover', 'working', 'first', 'novel', 'much', 'Inez', 'chagrin', 'Enamored', 'way', 'Paris', 'was', '1920', 'Gil', 'soon', 'alternate', 'universe', 'midnight', 'where', 'rubbing', 'elbows', 'martinis', 'jazz', 'clubs', 'not', 'only', 'Fitzgerald', 'Hemingway', 'also', 'influential', 'figures', 'Gertrude', 'Stein', 'Pablo', 'Picasso', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'Salvador', 'Dali', 'light', 'day', 'however', 'mundane', 'reality', 'Inez', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'completely', 'indifferent', 'flights', 'fancy', 'Matters', 'get', 'worse', 'when', 'Gil', 'Inez', 'bump', 'Paul', 'old', 'college', 'crush', 'hers', 'who', 'become', 'type', 'intolerable', 'pedant', 'Allen', 'skewered', 'so', 'well', 'movie', 'theater', 'scene', 'inAnnie', 'Hall', 'Gil', 'present-day', 'Paris', 'idealized', 'vision', 'city', 'past', 'will', 'likely', 'remind', 'Allen', 'fans', 'shenanigans', 'occurred', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'down', 'introduction', 'out-of-sync', 'love', 'interest', 'time', 'beautiful', 'clothing', 'designer', 'named', 'Adriana', 'who', 'was', 'Modigliani', 'mistress', 'now', 'become', 'Picasso', 'embattled', 'lover', 'Allen', 'obviously', 'regaling', 'Jazz', 'Age-era', 'Paris', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'passing', 'familiarity', 'period.When', 'saw', 'Steins', 'Collect', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Museum', 'Modern', 'Art', 'past', 'summer', 'received', 'in-depth', 'primer', 'seminal', 'figures', 'can', 'tell', 'Allen', 'less', 'interested', 'contemporary', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'arresting', 'characters', 'coming', 'more', 'stereotypes', 'game', 'cast', 'hapless', 'Gil', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'bit', 'improbable', 'writer', 'high', 'literary', 'aspirations', 'sincerity', 'role', 'win', 'over', 'Back', 'inMean', 'Girlsmode', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', ""n't"", 'given', 'that', 'much', 'do', 'Inez', 'express', 'constant', 'frustration', 'Usually', 'playing', 'sincere', 'historical', 'figures', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'David', 'Frost', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'field', 'day', 'entirely', 'unlikeable', 'Paul', 'predictably', 'no-nonsense', 'turn', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Stein', 'over-the-top', 'one', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'Dali', 'Scott', 'Zelda', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'malevolent', 'Loki', 'inThor', 'especially', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'play', 'archetypes', 'quite', 'well', 'real-life', 'figures', 'Corey', 'Stoll', 'out', 'pugnacious', 'Hemingway', 'Adriana', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'most', 'fantasy', 'figure', 'role', 'solid', 'work', 'Allen', 'still', 'fair', 'distance', 'most', 'accomplished']",N/A

This takes that singular idea and weaves it into a feature film - with all the strengths and weaknesses that implies.On the one hand it's funny and engaging, a treat of a film. It's well cast with Owen Wilson doing a good `Woody' turn; Marion Cotllard perfect as the coquettish muse and Corey Stoll stealing the show as a laugh-out-loud Hemmingway. Michael Sheen is also hysterical. The humour is a mix of contemporary digs, the rightwing of the Republican Party is the butt of several funny lines, and knowing but funny references to Paris of the 20s (though I admit I had to look up who Djuna Barnes was). The film's message - that the past is a nostalgic illusion and we must live for today - is hardly subtle or original but definitely something we could all do with being reminded about from time to time.On the other hand, there are plenty of flaws. The opening montage goes on far too long. I got it: we're in Paris! The relationship between Gil and Inez is too antagonistic to be credible. And since this is a concept movie, there's no real resolution to it; it can't go anywhere, so Woody just ends it with a downpour.But these are criticisms that are easy to overlook.

It is as if one only has to wait for the light to change a certain way, or for a bell to strike a certain hour, and the magic will happen--for those who are receptive to magic, that is, and are willing to believe in the Magic of Place.This is the premise of Woody Allen's latest whimsical flight into the imaginative world of Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), a self-acknowledged Hollywood screenwriting hack, who dreams of writing a novel, the protagonist of which owns a nostalgia shop. ""What is a nostalgia shop?"" asks one of Allen's characters. Anyone who has to ask such a question is assuredly immune to magic, and will probably not enjoy this film. Since I am a romantic and firmly believe in the Magic of Place, I enjoyed it immensely.Woody Allen clearly loves Paris. His opening scenes, in fact, represent a paean to The City of Light, as for almost four minutes the camera, with an evocative jazz accompaniment, moves from point to point along the Seine, the Luxembourg Gardens, Montmartre, the Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es, the Tuileries, the Left Bank, among other locations. We are treated to views of great boulevards, narrow streets, steep stairs, roofs with chimney pots, as the camera's eye glances at brasseries, cafes, fashion houses, fountains, the pyramid of the Louvre, Notre Dame, the Opera, and the Tour Eiffel. Paris in the sunshine; Paris in the rain. And all that is before the opening credits, in which we see that Allen, as usual, has assembled an ensemble cast. And for a special treat, the actual film begins among the lily ponds at Monet's Giverny.Although I enjoyed all the performances, I particularly liked Adrian Brodie as Salvator Dali (He seemed so perfectly at home in Dali's surrealist skin), and Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein (She brings a convincing panache to any part she plays). Marion Cotillard is charming as Pender's love-interest from the past, and her costumes--in fact, all the costumes--are splendid. Michael Sheen, looking a bit like Tony Blair with a beard, plays Paul, a pontificating academic, who cannot resist showing off his knowledge--never mind that he is mistaken--to their Rodin museum guide--played in an engaging cameo, by the glamourous Mme Sarkosy.""Midnight in Paris"" deals with themes similar to those in ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" in which the lines between past and present, between illusion and reality, become delightfully blurred. Magic, in fact, comes along in the form of a 1920 Peugeot, which stops and opens its door in invitation. If you accept, it will take you along for an enchanting ride!",5,Romanti-Sceptics Need Not Apply!,1324684800,"12 24, 2011",2011,2748,"['When', 'one', 'city', 'ancient', 'history', 'such', 'Paris', 'Rome', 'very', 'easy', 'sense', 'existence', 'imperceptible', 'permeability', 'past', 'present', 'one', 'only', 'wait', 'light', 'change', 'certain', 'way', 'bell', 'strike', 'certain', 'hour', 'magic', 'will', 'happen', 'who', 'are', 'receptive', 'magic', 'are', 'willing', 'believe', 'Magic', 'Place.This', 'premise', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'latest', 'whimsical', 'flight', 'imaginative', 'world', 'Gil', 'Pender', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'self-acknowledged', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriting', 'hack', 'who', 'writing', 'novel', 'protagonist', 'nostalgia', 'shop', 'What', 'nostalgia', 'shop', 'one', 'Allen', 'characters', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ask', 'question', 'assuredly', 'immune', 'magic', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'enjoy', 'film', 'am', 'romantic', 'firmly', 'believe', 'Magic', 'Place', 'enjoyed', 'immensely.Woody', 'Allen', 'clearly', 'Paris', 'opening', 'scenes', 'fact', 'represent', 'paean', 'City', 'Light', 'almost', 'four', 'minutes', 'camera', 'evocative', 'jazz', 'accompaniment', 'moves', 'point', 'point', 'along', 'Seine', 'Luxembourg', 'Gardens', 'Montmartre', 'Champs', 'Eacute', 'eacute', 'Tuileries', 'Left', 'Bank', 'other', 'locations', 'are', 'treated', 'views', 'great', 'boulevards', 'narrow', 'streets', 'steep', 'stairs', 'roofs', 'chimney', 'pots', 'camera', 'eye', 'glances', 'brasseries', 'cafes', 'fashion', 'houses', 'fountains', 'pyramid', 'Louvre', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'Opera', 'Tour', 'Eiffel', 'Paris', 'sunshine', 'Paris', 'rain', 'opening', 'credits', 'see', 'Allen', 'usual', 'assembled', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'special', 'treat', 'actual', 'film', 'lily', 'ponds', 'Monet', 'Giverny.Although', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'particularly', 'liked', 'Adrian', 'Brodie', 'Salvator', 'Dali', 'seemed', 'so', 'perfectly', 'home', 'Dali', 'surrealist', 'skin', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Gertrude', 'Stein', 'convincing', 'panache', 'part', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'charming', 'Pender', 'love-interest', 'past', 'costumes', 'fact', 'costumes', 'are', 'splendid', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'looking', 'bit', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'beard', 'Paul', 'pontificating', 'academic', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'resist', 'showing', 'off', 'knowledge', 'never', 'mind', 'mistaken', 'Rodin', 'museum', 'guide', 'played', 'engaging', 'cameo', 'glamourous', 'Mme', 'Sarkosy', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'deals', 'themes', 'similar', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'Cairo', 'lines', 'past', 'present', 'illusion', 'reality', 'become', 'delightfully', 'blurred', 'Magic', 'fact', 'along', 'form', '1920', 'Peugeot', 'door', 'invitation', 'accept', 'will', 'take', 'along', 'enchanting', 'ride']",N/A

Woody Allen and Paris ""fell"" in love with each other, and, as the result, we, the viewers, received a precious gift from the master of subtle, intelligent and charming dra-medies, gentle and charming ""movable feast,"" the new movie ""Midnight in Paris "".I have been a fan of Woody Allen for long times and seen all his movies, those that he made, and those in which he starred or only wrote the screenplay for. I look forward to each of his films and I am ready to love them before I even see them. I knew I would like Midnight in Paris, but I had no idea how good it was. From the first frame, following the Darius Khondji's camera on such familiar but uniquely beautiful streets, alleys, boulevards and quays of the City of Light, it was hard not to fell in love with Paris and with the film of Allen, his love letter to the most famous city in the world, capital of love and Mecca for writers, artists, musicians as to whom Paris gave inspiration during all times and epochs - Belle &Eacute;poque 1890s, the Golden days of the 1920s, and today, right now...Midnight in Paris is a delightful, kind (yes, this is Woody Allen), light, and charming film, which can be described as A Paris Midnight Magical Movable Feast. Paris in the film is beautiful during day light, night time, bright sun, and rainy hours. Oscar nominee, the master cinematographer of many remarkable films, including Panic Room, Se7en and Evita, Darius Khondji worked with Allen on three films: Anything Else (2003), Midnight in Paris (2011), and the next film, the Roman project Bop Decameron (2012).Soundtrack consists of Allen's favorite songs from the 1920s-30s by such songwriters as Cole Porter, Glen Miller, and Enoch Light, and from the repertoire of Josephine Baker and Juliet Greco. For the original film theme, Allen picked the guitar composition of the French jazz guitarist Stephane Wrembel ""Bistro Fada"". Wrembel's influence and source of inspiration has been the music of the famous French Gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt, whose longtime fan and admirer is Woody Allen himself. According Wrembel, Allen was searching for a typical French-Parisian melody, reflecting the spirit and atmosphere of Paris. I can confirm that the film theme and the songs that Allen picked up for Midnight in Paris are important, integral component of the film's charm and add to the romantic and joyous feeling that the film brings to the viewers.As always, in Woody Allen's movies, the actors give uniformly good performances. Owen Wilson is very convincing and likable as Gil, Hollywood's successful screenplay writer who works on a first novel, a protagonist, a much younger, attractive, and funny Woody Allen stand-in. Adrien Brody played the best role since The Pianist (very small cameo, but memorable and hilarious). Kathy Bates was very believable as a famous literary critic and friend to the struggling talented writers and artists. Alison Pill was impressive as the bright, outgoing but showing the signs of instability wife of the celebrated American writer. I hardly recognized Corey Stoll but liked him a lot as another famous American writer. Watching Marion Cotillard, I had no problems believing that the character she played, Adriana, could have been the muse and the girlfriend of not just one but three amazingly and uniquely talented world renowned painters. Rachel McAdams (Inez, Gil's not so romantic fianc&eacute;e), Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy (Inez's parents on the business trip in Paris who don't seem to approve their daughter's choice), and Michael Sheen (Paul, Inez's pedantic and arrogant former boyfriend from college) were quite good as not very likable Americans. The First Lady of France, Carla Bruni appeared in a small role of a museum guide.The story itself was so lovely in using the time travel as the plot device and brought so many funny and sharp one-liners, dialogs and scenes as well as the plenty moments of recognizing the beloved literature and art figures of the past, that I sat and smiled happily during the whole film. Like I mentioned in the beginning, I expected to love the film even before I saw it and knew from the very first scene that I was in for something very special but my husband, who is much more reserved in his ratings and not often calls a film a masterpiece, used the word for Midnight in Paris and asked whether the film has won some prestigious prizes. Well, the awards season is several months away, but for me, and I am sure for all Woody Allen's fans, Midnight in Paris is a great prize from the writer/director.",5,Midnight Magical Movable

From the opening montage of images of Paris to the simple ending of Paris in the rain, it never drags orgoes off course. Gil (Owen Wilson) plays an American screenwriter who through some sort of magic, each night is transported to Paris in the 1920's.Gil interacts with allthe players and the idols of his imaginations. Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Picasso, Cole Porter etc...His interactions and conversations are intelligent and fun  Even with the fantastic premise the film never veers off to silliness or camp. The characters he meets not only accept Gil for who he is, but actually embrace him which is a stark contrast to his daytime reality.Gil is in Paris with his fiancee who regularly treats Gil with disdain while at the same time planning their lives together in Malibu. Gil dreams of a simple life in Paris writing novels while she enjoys his career as a screenwriter and all it affords them in Hollywood. When Gil tries to explain and share his nocturnal experiences on the streets of Paris she dismisses him and recommends seeing a neurologist.Michael Sheen brilliantly plays an intellectual snob who is an old friend of Gil's fiancee. It is classic Woody Allen characterization of the annoying know it all but it is great fun seeing Gil in the Woody Allen role subtly but hilariously handle him.All of the cast is great especially the characters from the 1920's. The movie is gorgeously photographed and paced.This movie has it all. Comedy, romance, beautiful photography, time travel, great characters, acting and a wonderful soundtrack of Cole Porter and instrumental music.A great night at the movies.This was a movie made for the big screen and not for special effects or 3D.

1494738,A3W4VE2L5G4HN6,B005MYEPXC,Geraldine,"[3, 3]","Midnight in Paris, is a story with a timeless message.We can be happy wherever we are. Life is what we make of it, right here and right now. Seeking happiness in other places (and in the case of the main character in this story: other eras) never really lasts. But what a fun trip it was to go on, watching this story unfold.Visually, this movie is such a treat. The beauty of Paris portrayed in the present and from the perspective of the 1920's is breathtaking. There is a dreamy quality to this film throughout.Loved the costumes and the mesmerizing musical score too. My kind of music....classical jazz and Cole Porter, play on!Life is but a dream for the lead character Gil (Owen Wilson). Night after night... wishes granted. Visiting legendary haunts with some of his literary idols from the past, Gil is transported to another time and place. And a place in time that he doesn't really want to come back from to face the problems in his own 21st century life including a fiancee and in-laws that leave much to be desired.There is also a sadness to this story. Not just the voice but also the heart and soul of Woody Allen come through the main character's thoughts and words. It is obvious that there are personal memories woven into many scenes of this film. Maybe some &#34;could have beens&#34; and perhaps regrets for him too. It made the movie even more memorable and touching for me. I teared up a time or two watching and considering Woody Allen's mindset as the final cut rolled.The only negative for me. Some of the acting was a bit &#34;stilted&#34; for lack of a better word when it came to present-day interactions between Owen Wilson and his fiancee in the movie Rachel McAdams. I found some of the dialogue and interaction between these two characters a bit over the top at times, tedious...I was always happy when the story slipped back into the world of the 1920's and Gil's vivid imagination.This is an escape and &#34;feel good&#34; movie of the very best kind. I could imagine seeing this movie in a big old theatre. The kind that still has chandeliers, velvet seats and heavy drapes on the stage. For a matinee performance, even better. Stopping in for a break from a busy city street and day. That would really enhance the experience.

They were so mis-matched that the premise of a wedding was UNbelievable anyway.Owen Wilson was wasted because he was merely a body-double for Woody Allen. The writing was childish- not even good at a fairy tale level- & the interesting people from the 1920's were basically foils for Woody's dream of being able to go back in time and suggest ideas to them that they then would be remembered for in the future.(or so the lead character could use his inside infomation from the past to win arguments in the present) Quite the fantasy and not a bad idea but poorly realized in this movie.I think this movie was made BY Woody Allen FOR Woody Allen & that too could be OK If the writing and acting were better. The opening is a love letter to Paris and it is beautiful & the first half of the movie was....... tolerable but then it became a repetetive waste of time. And a giant boring cliche. Yikes what a let down after having this movie recommended to me by some friends and reading all of the glorious reviews in entertainment magazines. Did they see the same movie??

The film opens with a long sequence of views of the sights in Paris - no actors, no story, just the breathtaking magnificence of the City of Light. For this viewer that section i the most rewarding of the entire film.  Once the film starts Woody Allen imposes an improbable story with stereotype characters and with a few notable exceptions, it gets stuck in its own cuteness.VERY briefly screenwriter wannabe novelist Gil (Owen Wilson playing Owen Wilson) and his bride to be Inez (Rachel McAdams) are in Paris with Inez' parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy) who in turn are on a business trip.  Inez is a bore: Gil wants adventure.  As Inez sees the touristy places with her friends, the hideously boring pedantic Paul (Michael Sheen) and his flaky partner Carol (Nina Arianda), Gil escapes to walk the streets of Paris and fall in love with the history and the magic of the city.  At the stoke of midnight he is picked up by an elegant car and is taken to the 1920s where he encounters Cole Porter (Yves Heck), Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), F Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston) and his Zelda (Allison Pill), Josephine Baker (Sonia Rolland), Alice B. Toklas (Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Bourou-Rubinsztein) and Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo) and his current flame Adriana (Marion Cotillard who seems to have phoned in her performance), Djuna Barnes (Emmanelle Uzan), Salvador Dal&iacute; (Adrien Brody - in probably the only convincing performance in the film), Man Ray (Tom Cordier), Luis Bu&ntilde;uel (Adrien de Van), TS Eliot (David Lowe) - in other words all the famous artists of the 1920s.  Gil is captivated by the opportunity to share his work with these greats, though he finds it difficult to understand time travel. He falls for Adriana who in turn wishes she could live in the time of Le Belle Epoque so of course Gil and Adriana time travel again meeting Henri Matisse (Yves-Antoine Spoto), Toulesse-Lautrec (Vincent Menjou Cortes), Paul Gauguin (Olivier Rabourdin), and Edgar Degas (Franois Rostain) at Maxim's.  Gil by day grows less enamored with Inez and by night more infatuated by Adriana and in the end there is a permanent schism between Gil and Inez and we are left with the moral 'Don't wish to live in another time than your own.'Sounds like a run through of famous names?  It is.  Wilson is inept at romantic comedy, and Woody Allen's script is fairly boring for Allen's works.  BUT Paris is Gorgeous - and that is enough!

Acting for the most part was quite good especially the French actors but Wilson behaved more like a comic book author than anything more literate. The tete-a-tetes with the early 20th, late 19th century authors and artists was an off-the-wall creative view of their unembellished lives. Cinematography was great; props, settings and especially costuming were very great. Just how we ended up in these periods actually didn't really matter which is testimony to the fine directing, writing and acting. The viewer at first asks themselves if it's a Cinderfella fantasy, or parallel dimensional time travel, or psychological disorder, or an illusion but all that becomes a trivial sideshow to the endless enjoyable interactions.

1494747,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005MYEPXC,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","MIDNIGHT IN PARIS, in some ways, reminds me of that Twilight Zone episode, ""The Trouble With Templeton,"" in which an aging stage actor, nostalgic for his youth, ends up traveling to his past. Like that episode, there are wistful elements that suffuse this film's narrative. Our rear view mirror tends to be rose-tinted, isn't it? Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) and his fianc&eacute;e Inez (Rachel McAdams) are holidaying in Paris, sort of mooching off Inez's parents who are there on a business trip. Gil, a self-confessed hack scriptwriter who's raring to write his great American novel, is enamoured with La Ville-Lumi&egrave;re, the City of Light. On and on he goes regaling a couldn't care less Inez with anecdotes concerning the literary luminaries who populated Paris back in the day. Inez's eyes are gone all glazed. She'd rather go shopping. So, from jump, the dynamics of their relationship set off our uh-oh radar. And yet MIDNIGHT IN PARIS is touted partly as a frothy romantic comedy.It's written and directed by Woody Allen, and you know what you're getting with that name brand. Clever words, a touch of satire, a slice of whimsy, and a neurosis or two. I hear Owen Wilson delivering his dialogue, his verbal tics and cadence, and I picture Woody Allen mouthing along those same lines. I didn't like Wilson's character initially; he seemed a little pushy and opinionated. But then along comes Gil's fianc&eacute;e's old crush, a gent who is so pedantic and know-it-all that Gil, next to him, immediately becomes more sympathetic. After one evening of wine tasting, Mr. Pedantic extends an invitation to Gil and Inez to step out and go dancing; Inez accepts and Gil declines. Gil instead opts for a midnight stroll. And when he gets lost and sits on the steps of that old church, along sidles an old classic Peugeot packed with revelers who wave Gil on over. A bemused Gil gets in the Peugeot and off they motor to the swinging 1920s.No explanation at all for the time travel. Woody Allen expects us to just roll with it, and I was cool with that. In the dizzy era of jazz and flappers, a flabbergasted Gil bumps into one literary icon after another, from F. Scott Fitzgerald (and his wild wife Zelda) to Ernest Hemingway to Gertrude Stein (warmly played by Kathy Bates). And maybe the high point of Gil's evening takes place in Gertrude Stein's salon when she offers to proofread his manuscript.Meanwhile, life in the present day keeps on keeping on. Except that now Gil's fianc&eacute;e and her parents have taken to wondering where Gil disappears to when evening swings around. The future pops-in-law even sics a private detective to shadow him (the gumshoe's eventual fate may elicit a grin). In the roaring '20s, after each midnight, Gil keeps running into famous and interesting folks (including Adrien Brody's entertainingly manic Salvador Dali). And, in the past, Gil meets the exquisite Adriana (Marion Cotillard) who once was mistress to Braque and Modigliani and is currently Picasso's lover. Surprisingly, sparks fly between her and Gil. And I did mention ""frothy romantic comedy,"" didn't I?Every now and then a Woody Allen film muddles that line separating fantasy and reality. Two of my favorite Woody Allen films areSleeperandThe Purple Rose of Cairo, with MIDNIGHT IN PARIS perhaps elbowing in and inching up in my personal rankings. I love this premise; I love time travel. Paris looks exquisite, day or night. Woody Allen fabricates grace and wit and romance, not just of the heart but of an era. The ensemble cast is fantastic. Marion Cotillard is enchanting and luminous (but when is she not?). Owen Wilson's character exhibits such enthusiasm over the Who's Who of Paris circa 1920s that he becomes just irrepressible. Note that Woody isn't going for out-and-out authenticity with his depiction of the historical figures. He's having too good a time exaggerating a trait, tweaking a characteristic. I chuckled at Papa Hemingway's tendency to relate everything to one's masculinity and virility. I enjoyed Gil's befuddling of Luis Bu&ntilde;uel. I will say that you'll get more out of this film if you're familiar with even a few of the larger than life personalities Gil meets in the past. But if you were in the dark with some of these folks - as I was, occasionally - well, I say this: to the wiki!The DVD's bonus feature:- ""Midnight in Cannes"" - at the MIDNIGHT IN PARIS press conference in the Cannes Film Festival, 2011 (00:04:57 minutes)- Theatrical Trailer",4,"""Wow!

Allen's unsympathetic characterisation of Gil's fianc&eacute; and her wealthy friends and family in particular seems too full of easy cliches.

As he escapes his insufferable soon-to-be in-laws, Gil stumbles upon the Paris of the past he has romanticized so thoroughly and encounters F.

We always preferred his zanier, early movies, like ""Take the Money and Run,"" ""Play It Again, Sam,"" ""Sleeper,"" and so on.  Truly, some of his more recent efforts have been disappointing, to say the least.  But ""Midnight in Paris"" far exceeded our expectations.We looked at some of the other reviews and can't see what commenters are talking about.  The movie is beautifully shot and directed.  Owen Wilson is simply terrific as Woody's alter ego, and the storyline is totally engaging.  Sure, it's a bit of science fiction, with characters moving back and forth in time.  But that's what makes it so creative and different as a Woody Allen film.Back on Owen Wilson, he is a revelation in his mannerisms and halting speech.  He must have studied Woody's other movies, at length, where he himself was the central character.  It truly is an amazing performance and one you won't forget, if you're a Woody Allen fan.The other actors do well, too, with this quirky, yet profound story.  Paris looks gorgeous throughout and, on its review, the chamber of commerce must have done cartwheels.  The music was fine, centering as it did on Cole Porter and similar pieces from the 1920's.Summing up, this is the Woody Allen film we've been waiting for for a long time.

1494784,A1DJMQJ3NY7TV5,B005MYEPXC,Jordan David,"[2, 7]","I once wrote a short story set around a night in Paris. It was brief, whispful, and altogether gleefully fun to write, despite it (perhaps aptly) breezy, simple nature. Having never been a devout follower of Woody Allen, people I knew were still keen on telling me that his newest project in his fascinatingly schismed filmmaking career was something that would speak to me. Even after having watched the film, I still do not quite know what to make of it but, if the quality of ""Midnight in Paris"" is of any indication, I'll be flattered and take it as a compliment.Paris stands tall alongside New York as, perhaps, the most beloved city in the world. Seemingly catering to a man who has seen the rest of the world overcomplicate itself with the fallacies of a wholesome life, Allen paints the city as, quite literally, an escape from the more perplexing realities. Our naive and excitable writer protagonist, played by who appears to be an equally thrilled Owen Wilson, ventures throughout Paris' many different delights throughout the ages, meeting his historical icons and other prominent figures of the many artistic mediums. It sounds bizarre and ambiguous, but take it at face-value; this film bends reality, but to say anything more would be to spoil an otherwise remarkably exhilarating twist, at least to those who appreciate cameo appearances. Do yourself a favor and walk into this movie with a bat's blindness.One cannot help to echo the thrills that Owen Wilson's character feels during his midnight journeys, even if Allen's obvious love affair with the city is not one that we, as an audience, can replicate. Still, he does a good job of giving us a taste of said affection. ""Midnight in Paris"" is an earnest love letter to everything that thrives upon human passion: Writing, painting, dancing, singing - Art. Love. They slip in and out of one another's arms, these things. Allen does this with such clear and innocent giddiness that, initially, he teeters on one-dimensional themes and characters.Truth be told, outside of Gil, what you see is what you get, but Allen cleverly uses his unusual concept to deliver timely messages about life and one's complacency within it. It's hardly the likes of Kubrik-esque depth, but it stays with you. It's so very hard to expound upon any one detail with a film like this, as to do so would be detrimental to the experience of someone viewing it for the first time. The tale requires the audience to share the spirit of discovery with Gil. Do this, and the appreciation of this gem of a city isn't even mandatory.

1494786,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B005MYEPXC,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[121, 135]","This review may contain minor spoilers...Woody Allen's 41st film opens with several minutes of exquisite shots of Paris set to Jazz music. Cinematographer Darius Khondji elegantly captures these beautiful sites and effectively sets the tone for the film in which Owen Wilson plays Gil Pender, a Hollywood screenwriter working on his first novel while in Paris with his fianc&eacute;e Inez. After running into old acquaintances Paul and Carol (Michael Sheen and Nina Arianda), Gil goes on a walk to get away from it all and finds himself transported to the 1920s France, an era that he adores. There, he meets literary and cultural giants such as Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda Fitzgerald, Picasso, Gertrude Stein, and Salvador Dal&iacute;, among others. He also meets and becomes fascinated with Adriana (Marion Cotillard), Picasso's mistress, whose ideas about time are in synch with Gil's own.From the first frame, Midnight in Paris is one of Allen's most charming films in years. I've never seen a Woody Allen film I didn't like and there are only a few I wouldn't bother watching again. The general consensus is that his recent films are weak, especially in comparison to his earlier work. I am of the opinion that he's never made a bad film and each new film he made would be held in higher regard if not for the (many) films that had come before it. Whatever your stance is on Allen's films, both past and present, I think you'll agree that this is one of his best films in years. All of the elements; the casting, the setting, the style, and the story come together perfectly to create a magical romantic-comedy/fantasy. Midnight in Paris has many references to classic literature and film that certain audiences may not catch, but this movie is just so likeable that knowledge of the subjects involved is not necessary to enjoy it. It may cause you to seek it out after the film has ended however, but since when is knowledge a bad thing? It's certainly an accessible film, make no mistake about it, but it's also for a certain audience. If you're the casual moviegoer, you'll find little to dislike about it. If you're part of the audience this is intended for, you'll find almost nothing to dislike about it.The musical score is so brilliant that it couldn't possibly be original. While many parts of the score are recognizably made of classic jazz music and some Cole Porter songs, I figured the main theme was original; alas, there is no original score for the film. The use of music and the music used is brilliant, as well as essential to the effervescent tone of the film. I can't rave enough about Khondji's cinematography as it truly evokes the beauty of Paris and captures it in exactly the idealized way that Gil sees it. The whole film is beautifully shot, from the first frame to the last. The cinematography is a loving testament to the otherworldly beauty of Paris and the beautiful sites that the camera lovingly lingers on makes the film work almost as a visual tour of the city, but don't think for a minute that this is a bad thing. This is a fantasy film and Khondji makes Paris appear as the ultimate fantasy.As usual, Allen has assembled a wonderful cast lead by Owen Wilson in the Woody Allen role. Wilson shares some of the same mannerisms and speech patterns we'd expect if Allen played the role, but brings a distinct giddiness that only Wilson can convey. Gil is a memorable, extremely likeable protagonist whose wide-eyed wonder reflected my own. Allen never misses a chance to take jabs at pedantic, pseudo-intellectuals and Michael Sheen plays one perfectly, providing some great back-and-forth banter with Gil. Every actor makes an impression with their characters, with Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy being especially funny and well utilized as Inez's judgmental, materialistic parents. The historical figures throughout the film are given wonderful characterizations, with Corey Stoll turning in a vivacious, poetic performance as Hemingway and Kathy Bates making Gertrude Stein exude warmth and intelligence. Adrien Brody has an inspired cameo as the great surrealist Salvador Dal&iacute; and his scene was certainly a highlight (""I see...rhinoceros""). With the First Lady of France, Carla Bruni, making an appearance as well, Allen's strong group of actors are one of the driving forces behind the reason this movie works so well.Midnight in Paris features some of Allen's best writing years. The characters are well-developed of course, but the story is more inspired than usual. The dialogue is clever and witty (one of my favorite examples being Gil suggesting the plot of The Exterminating Angel to director Luis Bu&ntilde;uel). Allen even takes a moment to take some light-hearted jabs at Tea Party politics. The ""earrings scene"" meanwhile is the most well-executed comedic scene that Allen has filmed in some time. This is Allen's 41st theatrical film since 1972 and while he's admittedly had some hits and misses, he proves that at the age of 75 he's still capable of churning out a genuinely great film. After making a huge per-theatre average on only six screens, Sony slowly expanded Midnight in Paris and it has consistently remained in the top 10 movies at the box office since. This is a huge feat for a Woody Allen film. Audiences have responded because Allen has made a charming, lovely, whimsical fantasy film that shows Allen at his most accessible and most consistent. With 41 films under his belt it's hard to say where Midnight in Paris fares amongst those other releases, but based on sheer likeability and quality I can safely say it's my favorite film of 2011 thus far.GRADE: A",5,"Charming, Clever, and Beautiful -- Woody Allen's Latest Film is a Great One",1322784000,"12 2, 2011",2011,5655,"['review', 'may', 'contain', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'Woody', 'Allen',

He is entranced by Paris and it's history of attracting writers and philosophers.  His character is what Woody Allen played on-screen in his younger days, and Wilson pulls it off perfectly.  His fiance (the ever attractive Rachel McAdams), conversely, wants to shop, party and dance.  He gets tired of hanging out with her wealthy, consumerist parents and their pedantic know-it-all snob friend played expertly by Michael Sheen.  (BTW Sheen's character is just the sort of funny and pompous character that Woody Allen excels at putting in his movies, which you don't find in films done by virtually any other director.)Wilson starts wandering around late at night and stumbles into a magical spot in the city where he gets a ride from an old-style limo, and the mystical fun begins, with his trips back to the twenties, meeting Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein etc.Leave it to Allen to craft a light comedic movie that blends the life of the modern leisure class with 1920's nostalgia and intellectualism, all in a nice packet of personalities, with a dose of romance and magic thrown it.  I highly recommend it for a bit of light-hearted escapism.  As for its PG-13 rating, I really can't remember why it wouldn't be rated just a PG.  I would say that it is for adults mainly because of its intellectual and historical tone, but it's more family-friendly than many other movies with the PG-13 label (contrast with some PG-13s like 1408, Morning Glory, The Ring etc).",4,Mystical and nostalgic Woody Allen comedy,1327795200,"01 29, 2012",2012,1612,"['Owen', 'Wilson', 'wonderful', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'stand-in', 'comedy', 'young', 'couple', 'Paris', 'who', 'have', 'much', 'different', 'priorities', 'entranced', 'Paris', 'history', 'attracting', 'writers', 'philosophers', 'character', 'what', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'played', 'on-screen', 'younger', 'days', 'Wilson', 'off', 'perfectly', 'fiance', 'ever', 'attractive', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'conversely', 'shop', 'party', 'dance', 'tired', 'hanging', 'out', 'wealthy', 'consumerist', 'parents', 'pedantic', 'know-it-all', 'snob', 'friend', 'played', 'expertly', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'BTW', 'Sheen', 'character', 'just', 'sort', 'funny', 'pompous', 'character', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'excels', 'putting', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'films', 'done', 'virtually', 'other', 'director', 'Wilson', 'wandering', 'around', 'late', 'night', 'magical', 'spot', 'city', 'where', 'ride', 'old-style', 'limo', 'mystical', 'fun', 'trips', 'back', 'twenties', 'meeting', 'Hemingway', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'Gertrude', 'Stein', 'etc.Leave', 'Allen', 'craft', 'light', 'comedic', 'movie', 'life', 'modern', 'leisure', 'class', '1920', 'nostalgia', 'intellectualism', 'nice', 'packet', 'personalities', 'dose', 'romance', 'magic', 'thrown', 'highly', 'recommend', 'bit', 'light-hearted', 'escapism', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'rated', 'just', 'PG', 'would', 'say', 'adults', 'mainly', 'intellectual', 'historical', 'tone', 'more', 'family-friendly', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'PG-13', 'label', 'contrast', 'PG-13s', '1408', 'Morning', 'Glory', 'Ring', 'etc']",N/A

He has always worked at his best when he makes the setting of his tales a living breathing character, just as important in many ways as his lead actors. While he flirted with this in Annie Hall, it became all out love in Manhattan. New York City, misty, dusky, flowing with lights and life became Woody's greatest love, dwarfing his affections for his two female leads and in the end informing his character far more fully than either of them. He does it again in Paris, falling in love with the incomparable cultural and architectural history of the great city through his protagonist, played with great effect by Owen Wilson. Shedding his aw-shucks mannerisms for a more controlled, introspective performance he does a wonderful job portraying a man seeking his creative center amid a failing romance and what appears to be a series of delusional encounters with Paris' rich cast of creative luminaries. Ultimately he finds a new love, and thanks to the guidance of the friends he has made in his surreal experiences, begins to explore his boundaries as an artist. He finally realizes that the limits he had struggled with were entirely self imposed and that if he simply allows himself to have a little faith in his own abilities all things may be possible.",5,A Return to Form for Woody,1324771200,"12 25, 2011",2011,1362,"['opening', 'images', 'Paris', 'viewer', 'classic', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'experience', 'always', 'worked', 'best', 'when', 'setting', 'tales', 'living', 'breathing', 'character', 'just', 'important', 'many', 'ways', 'lead', 'actors', 'flirted', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'became', 'out', 'love', 'Manhattan', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'misty', 'dusky', 'flowing', 'lights', 'life', 'became', 'Woody', 'greatest', 'love', 'dwarfing', 'affections', 'two', 'female', 'leads', 'end', 'informing', 'character', 'far', 'more', 'fully', 'again', 'Paris', 'falling', 'love', 'incomparable', 'cultural', 'architectural', 'history', 'great', 'city', 'protagonist', 'played', 'great', 'effect', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Shedding', 'aw-shucks', 'mannerisms', 'more', 'controlled', 'introspective', 'performance', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'man', 'seeking', 'creative', 'center', 'failing', 'romance', 'what', 'be', 'series', 'delusional', 'encounters', 'Paris', 'rich', 'cast', 'creative', 'luminaries', 'Ultimately', 'new', 'love', 'thanks', 'guidance', 'friends', 'made', 'surreal', 'experiences', 'explore', 'boundaries', 'artist', 'finally', 'limits', 'had', 'struggled', 'were', 'entirely', 'self', 'imposed', 'simply', 'have', 'little', 'faith', 'own', 'abilities', 'things', 'may', 'be', 'possible']",N/A

He wrote and directed the movie and it is absolutely fascinating if you're interested in the arts and times of the 1920s. The protagonist (played by Owen Wilson), a successful Hollywood screen writer working on his first novel, is visiting Paris with his fiancee and her parents. One night his fiancee goes dancing with a couple they knew from back in California, but he doesn't want to go and chooses to walk back to the hotel alone. He gets lost in the streets of Paris. As the clock strikes midnight, a 1920's car drives up, stops, the people in the car convince him to join them, he gets in, and is driven into the past - the era that he feels is the Golden Age (the 1920s in Paris). He returns to the same place night after night and each night is driven back to the past where he meets the notables who lived during that time - artist, authors, sculptors, like Picasso, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Man Ray, Cole Porter, etc. Gertrude Stein critiques his novel; he is part of the inner circle. He meets a beautiful woman, a fashion designer, who has had affairs with Modigliani and other famous artists, presently with Picasso, and he falls in love with her. I won't go on because to do so I'd have to divulge how it all ends and I definitely do not want to do that. If you know anything about the arts of the 1920s, every time the protagonist meets someone else my guess is that you'll say &#34;Oh, my God&#34; more than once because the actors portraying those characters are so spot-on with their characterizations - at least from what I have read about them. The Hemingway character, for instance, is exactly what I imagine Ernest Hemingway would have been like at the time his first novel was published.

1494794,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B005MYEPXC,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[7, 8]","Woody Allen started off his filmmaking career with comedies, then swung to Ingmar Bergman influenced ""serious"" movies, but lately Allen has found a nice balance between the two, at least in ""Midnight in Paris.""Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is an American hack screenwriter in Paris with his fiancee Inez (Rachael McAdams). Gil is worried that he's missed the literary boat by not trying for art and writing a novel while living in a garret and suffering for your art. Gil is in love with the nostalgic history of Paris and the 1920's ""lost generation"" of Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston), and visits to Gertrude Stein's (Kathy Bates) salon and feels he was born in the wrong era. On a walk through the streets of Paris at midnight he's picked up by a car full of revelers and they whisk him off to a party, and finds himself being serenaded by Cole Porter (Yves Heck), and talking literature with Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston and Alison Pill), and they whisk Gil off to meet Hemingway and soon Gil is showing his novel to Gertrude Stein!This is every writers and/or artists fantasy, and Allen pulls it off masterfully. From capturing the sights and feel of Paris, to giving life to the period pieces of the fantasy. All the actors turn in fine nuanced performances that let you buy into Allen's fantasy. Nobody but Woody Allen can write the kind of dialog Allen can, in another writers hands the dialog would seem fumbling and tangential.All the characterizations are spot on, the actors even look like the people they're supposed to be, Kathy Bates as Stein almost steals the movie, and Adrien Brody's Dali is a humorous cameo. The only characterization that is a little off is of Hemingway. Allen's Hemingway seems like it's everything you've ever read about Hemingway in a condensed version. One minute Hemingway is pontificating about Zelda's envy of Scott Fitzgerald's writing (as correct as the assessment is) and the next second asking who wants to box.""Midnight in Paris"" is a nice fantasy, and an interesting alternative to all the super hero movies of this summer.",4,Midnight in Paris?

1494800,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B005MYEPXC,K. Gordon,"[4, 6]","A charming, sweet film, that explores the nature of nostalgia (its glowand its darker shadows), and shows off Paris, both modern day, and inthe 1920s, almost as beautifully as Manhattan showed off New York.Laced with wonderful cameo and supporting performances (Adrien Brody,Kathy Bates, Marion Cotillard, Corey Stoll, just to name a few) andgifted by a quirky, lovably sad Owen Wilson as a sort of Eyeore of astruggling writer in the lead.Wilson is probably the best stand in yet for Allen in one of his films,precisely because he's so different from Allen, and doesn't seem to bedoing an Allen impersonation. (Even Allen admitted that part of theappeal in casting Wilson was casting someone so far from himself).The 94 minutes of the film flew by, and never lost it's charm.A number of professional critics noted that this was a new tone forAllen, neither laugh out loud comedy, nor serious drama (or, as in hisgreatest films a combination of the two), but is more of a light drama,with a gentle comic whimsy. I actually think Allen started exploringthis interesting new tone with his last film 'You Will Meet a Tall DarkStranger' And it does seem to have reinvigorated him.I did have a couple of problems with the film. First, Rachel McAdams asWilson's fianc&eacute;, along with her family, were made too caraciturish, tooobviously 'bad' for a film this subtle. McAdams is a brilliant actress,but here she seems pushed into being a symbol of all that's wrong withshallow, materialistic Americans.More problematically, after gently, subtly exploring it's themes forthe whole film, Allen suddenly starts laying them on very thick at theend, putting them very literally into the dialogue, almost as if hedoesn't trust us to be smart enough to get the point of the wholelovely film he just showed us.But these are minor complaints, and while this may not be one ofAllen's great films, it is a very good one, and that makes it specialand worth seeking out.",4,Luminous and charming,1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,1954,"['charming', 'sweet', 'film', 'nature', 'nostalgia', 'glowand', 'darker', 'shadows', 'off', 'Paris', 'modern', 'day', 'inthe', '1920s', 'almost', 'as', 'beautifully', 'Manhattan', 'showed', 'off', 'New', 'York.Laced', 'wonderful', 'cameo', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Corey', 'Stoll', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'andgifted', 'quirky', 'lovably', 'sad', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'sort', 'Eyeore', 'astruggling', 'writer', 'lead.Wilson', 'probably', 'best', 'stand', 'yet', 'Allen', 'one', 'films', 'precisely', 'so', 'different', 'Allen', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bedoing', 'Allen', 'impersonation', 'Even', 'Allen', 'admitted', 'part', 'theappeal', 'casting', 'Wilson', 'was', 'casting', 'someone', 'so', 'far', '94', 'minutes', 'film', 'flew', 'never', 'lost', 'charm.A', 'number', 'professional', 'critics', 'noted', 'was', 'new', 'tone', 'forAllen', 'out', 'loud', 'comedy', 'serious', 'drama', 'hisgreatest', 'films', 'combination', 'two', 'more', 'light', 'drama', 'gentle', 'comic', 'whimsy', 'actually', 'think', 'Allen', 'started', 'exploringthis', 'interesting', 'new', 'tone', 'last', 'film', 'Will', 'Meet', 'Tall', 'DarkStranger', 'seem', 'have', 'reinvigorated', 'him.I', 'did', 'have', 'couple', 'problems', 'film', 'First', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'asWilson', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'family', 'were', 'made', 'too', 'caraciturish', 'tooobviously', 'film', 'subtle', 'McAdams', 'brilliant', 'actress', 'here', 'pushed', 'being', 'symbol', 'wrong', 'withshallow', 'materialistic', 'Americans.More', 'problematically', 'gently', 'subtly', 'exploring', 'themes', 'forthe', 'whole', 'film', 'Allen', 'suddenly', 'laying', 'very', 'thick', 'theend', 'putting', 'very', 'literally', 'dialogue', 'almost', 'hedoes', ""n't"", 'trust', 'be', 'smart', 'enough', 'get', 'point', 'wholelovely', 'film', 'just', 'showed', 'us.But', 'are', 'minor', 'complaints', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'ofAllen', 'great', 'films', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'specialand', 'seeking', 'out']",N/A

Gil (Owen Wilson) reminds me of James Stewart (in the old ""classic"" movies).  He is always in the background, holding back, watching everything that's taking place but not saying what he thinks and seemingly unable to change the things that are going on around him.  He's a ""nice"" guy who has taken it a bit too far so that people dismiss him and take advantage of his good nature.  He is a writer who is in love with the past and in this film, his fantasy of visiting the past, actually comes true.  Once he slides down the rabbit hole, he is able to interact with his heroes, fall in love, and catch a glimpse of the old Paris with which he is so enamored.  Scott and Zelda are wonderful and the party filled world that Gil accidentally stumbles into is a feast for the eyes.  If you can overlook or laugh at the snobby, conceited, moronic people that surround Gil in his everyday life, you are in for a treat.  The music is pretty good as well.  The moral of the story is that no matter what period of time you actually live in, most people glamorize/romanticize a certain period of time in the past.  When Gil finally made it to his dream past he found that the people he admired so much were dissatisfied with their present and when he went back even farther, he found that those people were unhappy about their own time period and felt  that the Renaissance was the best time to have been alive.  We are too close to our own present...we can't see it...no matter how Gil tried to impress the importance of THEIR time on those around him, they couldn't understand what he was seeing/saying because they were too busy living it and writing/painting their world into existence.

1494809,A18HHKM6WGEF9D,B005MYEPXC,"L. Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[2, 2]","Midnight in Paris is beautifully filmed with a good heart and dose of Woody Allen whimsy (my favorite of his various aspects), so I really enjoyed it. However, I wasn't as over the moon for it as many apparently were, so it was a 4-star, rather than 5-star, film to me. The story centers on Gil (Owen Wilson) a successful screenwriter who dreams of writing novels instead. He and his fiance (Rachel McAdams) - who seem mismatched from the start - visit Paris, and on one of his night wanderings (to escape the many social engagements she wants to attend) he finds himself transported to 1920's Paris, the 'Golden Age' to him. He interacts with the likes of Ernest Hemingway, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Salvatore Dali, and Picasso.On the plus side, Paris has never been more beautiful as in this film, even on the 'small screen' (I can only imagine how gorgeous this was in the theaters.) The characters all are well-cast, and as an Owen Wilson fan, I was happy to see him do so well in this role. All of the 20's characters are also deftly played, although my favorite scenes - the funniest - were actually the contemporary ones, with his fiance's stuffy in-laws and friends. Wilson's character got to show a bit of acerbic wit in those scenes, and hence they were more fun. The 20's scenes were all very earnest and a bit self-important, so I just didn't enjoy them as much.So overall, fun, unique, beautiful, and with many funny moments. If you love Paris, and especially if you love the bohemian Paris of the 1920s (and all the artists that thrived then), you will LOVE this film. If you are a fan of Allen's whimsy, you probably will too. Otherwise, it may just be good or OK for you, but certainly still worth seeing.",4,"Lovely and Fun, But I Wasn't As Over the Moon as Many",1322784000,"12 2, 2011",2011,1723,"['Midnight', 'Paris', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'good', 'heart', 'dose', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'whimsy', 'favorite', 'various', 'aspects', 'so', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'However', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'moon', 'many', 'apparently', 'were', 'was', '4-star', 'rather', '5-star', 'film', 'story', 'centers', 'Gil', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'successful', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'writing', 'novels', 'instead', 'fiance', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'who', 'seem', 'mismatched', 'start', 'visit', 'Paris', 'one', 'night', 'wanderings', 'escape', 'many', 'social', 'engagements', 'attend', 'transported', '1920', 'Paris', ""'Golden"", 'Age', 'likes', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'Scott', 'Zelda', 'Fitzgerald', 'Salvatore', 'Dali', 'Picasso.On', 'plus', 'side', 'Paris', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'beautiful', 'film', 'even', ""'small"", 'screen', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'gorgeous', 'was', 'theaters', 'characters', 'are', 'well-cast', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'fan', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'role', '20', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'deftly', 'played', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'funniest', 'were', 'actually', 'contemporary', 'ones', 'fiance', 'stuffy', 'in-laws', 'friends', 'Wilson', 'character', 'got', 'show', 'bit', 'acerbic', 'wit', 'scenes', 'hence', 'were', 'more', 'fun', '20', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'earnest', 'bit', 'self-important', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'much.So', 'overall', 'fun', 'unique', 'beautiful', 'many', 'funny', 'moments', 'love', 'Paris', 'especially', 'love', 'bohemian', 'Paris', '1920s', 'artists', 'thrived', 'then', 'will', 'LOVE', 'film', 'are', 'fan', 'Allen', 'whimsy', 'probably', 'will', 'too', 'Otherwise', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'good', 'OK', 'certainly', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

We get the usual constant New York over-analytical voice-overed babble that made Allen and his many neuroses such a self-caricature in the end. The actor even dresses in ill-fitting oversize clothing, as did Allen. It's as though Allen really wanted to play the lead himself, but he was too old so he just hired an impersonator.That aside, ....the film opens with a lingering homage to Paris, ...the ""tourist"" Paris, ...which is probably the one we all want to see anyway. For some inexplicable reason known only to Allen it's all shot through a deep orange gel. I can only suggest it was meant to symbolise ""warm memories""?If indeed this is the case then those memories must have been viewed through one of those Tandoori Chicken spray-tans we see on women nowadays.The story itself has been well documented here. It requires you to suspend disbelief and ignore holes in the plot large enough to run the Metro through, but it's one of those movies where you can thoroughly enjoy sitting back and just letting it all wash over you. The strongest performances are all from bit players, ....Kathy Bates is a standout as Gertrude Stein.The bride-to-be's parents are truly obnoxious American snobs, ....sadly not all that hard to find in today's Paris, although the mother does get some of the best lines.Wait for ""And cheap is cheap I say!"" Perfect!The bride herself is just SO vapid, shallow and self-obsessed that you cannot believe even the Woody Allen impersonator could ever have fallen for her in the first place, much less made it right through engagement and onto the impending marriage situation.It's not giving anything away when I say that you too will know in about the first 15 minutes that she will be found out as having it off with the ""know-it-all"".What is interesting about this movie is that the ""real"" people are just character ""types"", ......one dimensional and very stereotyped, while the fantasy characters have much more depth and end up stealing the show, ...along with the romantic City of Paris, which is probably the real star.A case of imagination being stronger than reality perhaps?I must confess that I have a fascination with Paris, ( I live there for six or so months each year), and the characters we see in the periods revisited during the course of this movie, so the historical re-creations of both people and places held the most interest for me.You'll all know where this movie is going, but the journey is a very pleasant and picturesque one if you are able to just go along with it all. It's a fantasy, and whether any of it is meant to be actuality or it all takes place in the lead's over-active imagination doesn't really matter.(No, he doesn't seem to drink absinthe at any stage.....)Personally I'd have dreamed up some serious injuries indeed to get out of marrying the air-head and becoming part of her profoundly irritating family. That's injury for them, .....not me.I kept hoping he'd throw her off the troisieme etage of the Eiffel Tower and push Mom & Dad under a speeding Metro!The know-it-all gets EXACTLY what he deserves in the end,(hurrah!) ......although I thought the VERY attractive, well mannered and bright guide at the Musee Rodin a far better prospect than the teenager from the flea markets for Mr. Allen.....sorry, I must remember it was Owen Wilson!But then Mr. Allen always had that penchant for VERY YOUNG girls didn't he!Probably goes a long way towards explaining the ending.......Trivial Footnote: I wonder why the poster specifically references Van Gogh's night sky over Paris when that particular artist is never mentioned at all in the film?",4,WOODY DOES PARIS?,1321833600,"11 21, 2011",2011,3887,"['hated', 'protaganist', 'very', 'beginning', 'strangely', 'enough', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'immensely.The', 'lead', 'male', 'whom', 'are', 'supposed', 'sympathise', 'was', 'obviously', 'told', 'do', 'very', 'best', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'impersonation', 'much', 'irritation', 'get', 'usual', 'constant', 'New', 'York', 'over-analytical', 'voice-overed', 'babble', 'made', 'Allen', 'many', 'neuroses', 'such', 'self-caricature', 'end', 'actor', 'even', 'ill-fitting', 'oversize', 'clothing', 'did', 'Allen', 'Allen', 'really', 'wanted', 'play', 'lead', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'just', 'hired', 'impersonator.That', 'aside', '.the', 'film', 'lingering', 'homage', 'Paris', 'tourist', 'Paris', 'probably', 'one', 'want', 'see', 'anyway', 'inexplicable', 'reason', 'known', 'only', 'Allen', 'shot', 'deep', 'orange', 'gel', 'can', 'only', 'suggest', 'was', 'meant', 'symbolise', 'warm', 'memories', 'indeed', 'case', 'then', 'memories', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'viewed', 'one', 'Tandoori', 'Chicken', 'see', 'women', 'nowadays.The', 'story', 'been', 'well', 'documented', 'here', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'ignore', 'holes', 'plot', 'large', 'enough', 'run', 'Metro', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'can', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'sitting', 'back', 'just', 'letting', 'wash', 'strongest', 'performances', 'are', 'bit', 'players', '.Kathy', 'Bates', 'standout', 'Gertrude', 'Stein.The', 'bride-to-be', 'parents', 'are', 'truly', 'obnoxious', 'American', 'snobs', '.sadly', 'not', 'that', 'hard', 'find', 'today', 'Paris', 'mother', 'get', 'best', 'lines.Wait', 'cheap', 'cheap', 'say', 'Perfect', 'bride', 'just', 'SO', 'vapid', 'shallow', 'self-obsessed', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'even', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'impersonator', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'fallen', 'first', 'place', 'much', 'less', 'made', 'right', 'engagement', 'impending', 'marriage', 'situation.It', 'not', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'when', 'say', 'too', 'will', 'know', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'will', 'be', 'found', 'out', 'having', 'off', 'know-it-all', '.What', 'interesting', 'movie', 'real', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'character', 'types', 'one', 'dimensional', 'very', 'stereotyped', 'fantasy', 'characters', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'depth', 'end', 'up', 'stealing', 'show', 'romantic', 'City', 'Paris', 'probably', 'real', 'star.A', 'case', 'imagination', 'being', 'stronger', 'reality', 'perhaps', 'must', 'confess', 'have', 'fascination', 'Paris', 'live', 'there', 'six', 'so', 'months', 'year', 'characters', 'see', 'periods', 'revisited', 'course', 'movie', 'historical', 're-creations', 'people', 'places', 'held', 'most', 'interest', 'me.You', ""'ll"", 'know', 'where', 'movie', 'going', 'journey', 'very', 'pleasant', 'picturesque', 'one', 'are', 'able', 'just', 'go', 'along', 'fantasy', 'meant', 'be', 'actuality', 'place', 'lead', 'over-active', 'imagination', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'No', ""n't"", 'seem', 'drink', 'absinthe', 'stage', '..', 'Personally', ""'d"", 'have', 'dreamed', 'up', 'serious', 'injuries', 'indeed', 'get', 'marrying', 'air-head', 'becoming', 'part', 'profoundly', 'irritating', 'family', 'injury', '..not', 'me.I', 'kept', 'hoping', ""'d"", 'throw', 'off', 'troisieme', 'etage', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'push', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'speeding', 'Metro', 'know-it-all', 'EXACTLY', 'what', 'end', 'hurrah', 'thought', 'VERY', 'attractive', 'well', 'mannered', 'bright', 'guide', 'Musee', 'Rodin', 'far', 'better', 'prospect', 'teenager', 'flea', 'markets', 'Mr.', 'Allen', '..sorry', 'must', 'remember', 'was', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'then', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'always', 'had', 'penchant', 'VERY', 'YOUNG', 'girls', 'did', ""n't"", 'Probably', 'long', 'way', 'explaining', 'ending', '.Trivial', 'Footnote', 'wonder', 'why', 'poster', 'specifically', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'night', 'sky', 'Paris', 'when', 'particular', 'artist', 'never', 'mentioned', 'film']",N/A

Actually, it was so good that I didn't want it to end.  This is saying a lot for me because I usually don't like romantic comedies.  But ""Midnight in Paris"" is so intellectually conceived, well paced and intelligent that I forgot all my preconceived notions about this genre.The film opens in modern Paris with a young couple on a pre-marriage honeymoon. Owen Wilson is cast as the future groom.  He makes a good living writing film scripts but his real ambition is to write a novel. This ambition is ridiculed by his fianc&eacute; as well her parents.  One night, not being able to stand the ""know-it-all"" stuffiness of a friend of the bride, he takes a walk at midnight.  Suddenly an old fashioned car from the 1920's pulls up and the partying people inside invite him in.  He then time-travels back in time to the 1920's and meets such greats as Cole Porter, Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald, Josephine Baker, Salvador Dali and various other personages of that time.  He even gets a chance to ask Gertrude Stein, played by Kathy Bates, to give him her honest opinion of his novel.  This is a wonderland for him as well as the audience and the fast-paced script kept me completely involved as the plot developed.Our hero also meets Adriana, played by Marion Cotillard, and falls in love.  However, she finds the 1920's boring and glorifies the turn of the century.  Later on they are transported to that time and place only to meet the famous people who find an earlier period of time the most fascinating.  All this is very interesting and the casting is terrific, even including the First Lady of France, Carla Bruni, cast a museum tour guide.All this is done with all the pomp and costumes of the various eras, making for great comedy, nostalgia and authenticity.  How it all turns out is to be expected with our hero beginning a new romance in the present. It's not usual that I heap such extraordinary praise on a movie.

""However, when you make love with a truly great woman, one that deserves the utmost respect in this world and one that makes you feel truly powerful, that fear of death completely disappears.""Paris is her name. She has seduced writers for centuries, and in ""Midnight in Paris"" writer/director Woody Allen makes love to her with his camera, in the most poetic of ways.Or perhaps he's referring to art, to achieving such intimacy with your craft and such artistic climax that you become immortal, like Hemingway, Matisse, Fitzgerald, Picasso, Dali, or Allen himself.Gil Pender, the protagonist in Allen's new film, has never experienced that kind of artistic height. Played quite convincingly by Owen Wilson (in a surprising and refreshing role that Allen had to re-write for him), Gil is an aspiring novelist who is visiting Paris with his girlfriend (Rachel McAdams) and her parents. But while they prefer to shop and visit museums, Gil chooses to wonder about. ""No work of art can compare to a city,"" he says.Pender is actually mesmerized by the City of Lights and fantasizes about what he believes was Paris' Golden Age, the 1920s with the Lost Generation of American writers walking its streets, writing in sidewalk caf&eacute;s, and frequenting smoky bars and flamboyant parties. One evening at midnight, trying to find his way back to the hotel, something magical happens to Gil. Really! But no reviewer should give that magic away.Getting lost in the city seems to be a symbol for how lost he really is, as a person and as a writer, and although he's somewhat insecure and anxious (he even carries a bottle of Valium with him), he's actually a likable guy and soon meets a few bohemian friends (played by Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Adrien Brody, among others) who give him much-needed advice about life and the creative process.From the beginning, ""Midnight in Paris"" grabs you with its witty and sophisticated dialogue about art, culture and literature, and in the second half the dialogue gets even better. For instance, my favorite line comes from one of the bohemian characters, who believes that: ""the job of the artist is not to succumb to despair but to find an antidote for the emptiness of existence.""Another piece of wisdom comes from one of the antagonists who criticizes Gil for being infatuated with the past: ""Nostalgia is denial...a flaw in the romantic imagination of people who find it difficult to cope with the present."" Think about that one while watching the film, for I believe, there lies the moral of this fabulous fable about the past and the present.At age 75--with more than 40 films under his belt--Allen has created a film that literally glows. Its dazzling cinematography, inventive plot, and Parisian score, combined with the top-notch acting and set-design, makes for an almost-perfect film, one that's not only clever and thought-provoking, but also entertaining and accessible--even to mainstream audiences.",5,It Glows!

Owen Wilson, an actor I love even though I frequently don't care for his movies, finally plays a worthy role as Gil Pender. Gil, a successful Hollywood script writer, dreams of making his mark on literature with a good novel. He idolizes the artists who gathered in Paris after World War I--Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds, Dali, Braque, Picasso, Gertrude Stein, Cole Porter--and believes he was born too late. Gil is a Woody Allen type, introspective and yearning, but as played by Wilson, less narcissistic, more open-hearted and, I must say, much better looking.Gil comes to Paris with his beautiful, materialistic fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her conservative parents, who disapprove of Gil. Gil loves Paris and is eager to explore and visit his idols' haunts, but Inez just wants to shop and hang out with her obnoxious friends and her parents. The audience can see immediately that Gil and Inez are a mismatch, but Gil mistakes physical attraction for love. After drinking a bit too much at a wine tasting, Gil decides to go for a walk alone. At the stroke of midnight, he sits down on some steps, and a vintage Peugeot picks him up and carries him away to the 1920s.I won't say more about the plot, but it's a joy to see wide-eyed Gil interact with his artistic heroes of the past, consider what makes art and life worthwhile, and question the direction his present is taking. There are some sweet comic moments. You'll find the glowing shots of Paris, today and as imagined 90 years ago, that you expect in a Woody Allen city valentine movie. The casting is excellent, the pace is brisk, the script is witty, and a pitch-perfect jazz soundtrack accompanies the gorgeous images and charming fable. &#34;Midnight in Paris&#34; may not have the heft or hilarity of Allen's strongest films, but within its limits, it's a delightful way to spend a couple of hours.",4,Charming Fantasy Fable,1402444800,"06 11, 2014",2014,1986,"['34', 'Midnight', 'Paris', '34', 'mix', 'comic', 'fable', 'fantasy', 'eye', 'mind', 'heart', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'actor', 'love', 'even', 'frequently', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'movies', 'finally', 'worthy', 'role', 'Gil', 'Pender', 'Gil', 'successful', 'Hollywood', 'script', 'writer', 'dreams', 'making', 'mark', 'literature', 'good', 'novel', 'artists', 'who', 'gathered', 'Paris', 'World', 'War', 'Hemingway', 'Fitzgeralds', 'Dali', 'Braque', 'Picasso', 'Gertrude', 'Stein', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'was', 'born', 'too', 'late', 'Gil', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'type', 'introspective', 'yearning', 'played', 'Wilson', 'less', 'narcissistic', 'more', 'open-hearted', 'must', 'say', 'much', 'better', 'looking.Gil', 'Paris', 'beautiful', 'materialistic', 'fiancee', 'Inez', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'conservative', 'parents', 'who', 'Gil', 'Gil', 'Paris', 'eager', 'explore', 'visit', 'idols', 'haunts', 'Inez', 'just', 'shop', 'hang', 'out', 'obnoxious', 'friends', 'parents', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'immediately', 'Gil', 'Inez', 'are', 'mismatch', 'Gil', 'physical', 'attraction', 'love', 'drinking', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'wine', 'tasting', 'Gil', 'go', 'walk', 'alone', 'stroke', 'midnight', 'down', 'steps', 'vintage', 'Peugeot', 'up', 'away', '1920s.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'plot', 'joy', 'see', 'wide-eyed', 'Gil', 'interact', 'artistic', 'heroes', 'past', 'consider', 'what', 'art', 'life', 'worthwhile', 'question', 'direction', 'present', 'taking', 'are', 'sweet', 'comic', 'moments', ""'ll"", 'find', 'glowing', 'shots', 'Paris', 'today', 'as', 'imagined', '90', 'years', 'ago', 'expect', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'city', 'valentine', 'movie', 'casting', 'excellent', 'pace', 'brisk', 'script', 'witty', 'pitch-perfect', 'jazz', 'soundtrack', 'gorgeous', 'images', 'charming', 'fable', '34', 'Midnight', 'Paris', '34', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'heft', 'hilarity', 'Allen', 'strongest', 'films', 'limits', 'delightful', 'way', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours']",N/A

Burns,"[2, 2]","Finally, after fifteen years of mostly spotty and seemingly hastily put together films, Woody seems to have invested more time and money in this one, and produced a winner.The plot of 'Midnight in Paris' isn't particularly original, as Woody borrows from himself and others as he's prone to do.  But it's well crafted, well acted, and plain fun to watch.  'Midnight' is more reminiscent of his early ""classic"" period ('Play it Again Sam' thru 'Love and Death'), which had broader appeal than his later adult situation ""dromedys"", and more laughs.Everything seems to hit here; his directing is tighter than it's been for a while, and the casting is superb.  No one could top Alison Pill's hilariously delightful portrayal of Zelda Fitzgerald.  If this isn't Zelda as she was, then it's how she should have been.  I don't know if Ms. Pill has enough screen time to merit Best Supporting Actor, but this performance will surely have producers calling.  She's already slated to appear in Woody's next film. (Unfortunately lead actor Owen Wilson's performance wanes in comparison, as he appears a bit out of his league, but given that is his character's role anyway it's not so detrimental to the film.)Finally, there is absolutely nothing offensive here, and if your teenagers aren't familiar with the Lost Generation, or slogged and suffered through 'The Great Gatsby', then this should kindle their interest as a fun way to learn of that era.",5,"De-lightful, De-lovely; Zelda is a ""Real Pill""",1324944000,"12 27, 2011",2011,1440,"['Finally', 'fifteen', 'years', 'mostly', 'spotty', 'seemingly', 'hastily', 'put', 'together', 'films', 'Woody', 'have', 'invested', 'more', 'time', 'money', 'one', 'produced', 'winner.The', 'plot', ""'Midnight"", 'Paris', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'original', 'Woody', 'others', 'prone', 'do', 'well', 'crafted', 'well', 'acted', 'plain', 'fun', 'watch', ""'Midnight"", 'more', 'reminiscent', 'early', 'classic', 'period', ""'Play"", 'Again', 'Sam', 'thru', ""'Love"", 'Death', 'had', 'broader', 'appeal', 'later', 'adult', 'situation', 'dromedys', 'more', 'laughs.Everything', 'hit', 'here', 'directing', 'tighter', 'been', 'while', 'casting', 'superb', 'one', 'could', 'top', 'Alison', 'Pill', 'hilariously', 'delightful', 'portrayal', 'Zelda', 'Fitzgerald', ""n't"", 'Zelda', 'was', 'then', 'how', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Ms', 'Pill', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'merit', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'performance', 'will', 'surely', 'have', 'producers', 'calling', 'already', 'slated', 'appear', 'Woody', 'next', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'lead', 'actor', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'performance', 'wanes', 'comparison', 'bit', 'league', 'given', 'character', 'role', 'anyway', 'not', 'so', 'detrimental', 'film', 'Finally', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'offensive', 'here', 'teenagers', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Lost', 'Generation', 'slogged', 'suffered', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'then', 'should', 'kindle', 'interest', 'fun', 'way', 'learn', 'era']",N/A

He gets lost, and then he meets some colorful new friends who are right out of the Golden Age: we're talking Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, and Gertrude Stein here, among others. Gil also meets a charming woman (Marion Cotillard) who makes him begin to question the choices he's made and determine what he wants out of life.This is a beautiful and clever film full of witty references to classic art, literature, etc. It's also a great story about a man who really finds himself in the beautiful City of Lights.

One night, wandering alone through the Rive Gauche, he sees an ancient Peugeot limousine; the passengers stop and invite him in. This is Gil's entry into the Paris of his dreams--the Paris of the Twenties, in which Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody), Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald (Alison Pill, Tom Hiddleston) and others cavort in a magical city of abundant promise and possibility. There is even more promise and possibility in the person of Adriana (Marion Cotillard), a beautiful fashion designer and artists' groupie with a passion for the Belle Epoque of Gauguin and Toulouse-Lautrec.Allen doesn't try to make ""Midnight in Paris"" anything more than an airy little souffle of a movie. But the film is far more optimistic than any that Allen has made recently, and he sustains its magical mood brilliantly.

The man, played by Owen Wilson, longs to be in the Paris of the 1920s when future big time writers were cross pollinating their artistic ideas amidst flamboyant parties, intellectual discourses and smokey cafes. But his unlikable, pretentious fiance, played by Rachel McAdams, is all about the money and her parents show you how she came to be that way. The main character soon finds himself whisked off to a magical place every day at midnight in which he meets all of his artistic heroes from the 1920s who go about helping him get out of his writing funk (he's a successful screenwriter trying to become an artistic novelist) yet when he returns to the present time he finds himself surrounded by non supportive people so he soon finds himself longing for the night. There are some interesting themes in this tale focused on nostalgia, modernism, why art matters, intellectualism and of course the magic of Paris. Owen Wilson does an admirable job channeling the Woody Allen persona. It was nice to see Kathy Bates in the film (as Gertrude Stein and Gil's writing mentor) as well as Adrien Brody (who played Dali) and Corey Stoll (as Hemingway).

Gil: You haven't even read it yet. Ernest Hemingway: If it's bad, I'll hate it. If it's good, then I'll be envious and hate it even more. You don't want the opinion of another writer. // Ernest Hemingway: Picasso only thinks that women are to sleep with, or to paint. // Gertrude Stein: You have a clear and lovely voice. Don't be such a defeatist. /// Gil: That's what the present is.

El-Hewie""","[0, 2]","""Midnight is Paris"" was the perfect title for a story that narrates a universal struggle of spouses stuck in irreconcilable differences. The fiance was overwhelmed with his partner's detachment and uncaring behavior. The fiancee's inability to separate from her previous romantic attachment caused her to take her present fiance for granted and to approach him as a failing and unworthy lover. As in many failing relationships, the in-laws united with their daughter in pushing her to the edge where her male partner was cornered with three hateful family members.The major cause of success in the movie was the docile and decent conduct of the fiance who portrayed a helpless victim of spousal abuse in face of pushy and demanding fiancee. His only escape from his tormentors was traveling back in time through the early decades of the twentieth century in Paris. Those day-, or for that purpose, night-dreams lent him greater support in bailing out of a pending disastrous marriage.Through the real world, of a daughter and her family cooperating in messing up a new blossoming relationship where the daughter obsessed of fitting her new fiancee into her past broken romance, and the fictional world of esacping into the past and living the great era of art and literature of France during the twentieth century, the movie painted the complex struggle of a writer dreaming to reconcile his fictional imagination with a materialistic and fast lifestyle of ordinary people.The fictional night-dream was a true paradise for an aspiring writer where many great theories, plays, characters, and acts could come to live and assure the struggling victim with his true worthiness in the universe.  The real daily world with filled with sun light that made characters and objects appear fake and artificial. Both the victim and the viewers were relieved by the courage of the fiance to end a hellish relationship despite the sad end of his fictional day-dreams that crashed in another broken romance.",5,A story that touches many souls entangled in unfit relationships,1308960000,"06 25, 2011",2011,1993,"['Midnight', 'Paris', 'was', 'perfect', 'title', 'story', 'universal', 'struggle', 'spouses', 'stuck', 'irreconcilable', 'differences', 'fiance', 'was', 'overwhelmed', 'partner', 'detachment', 'uncaring', 'behavior', 'fiancee', 'inability', 'separate', 'previous', 'romantic', 'attachment', 'caused', 'take', 'present', 'fiance', 'granted', 'approach', 'failing', 'unworthy', 'lover', 'many', 'failing', 'relationships', 'in-laws', 'united', 'daughter', 'pushing', 'edge', 'where', 'male', 'partner', 'was', 'cornered', 'three', 'hateful', 'family', 'members.The', 'major', 'cause', 'success', 'movie', 'was', 'docile', 'decent', 'conduct', 'fiance', 'who', 'portrayed', 'helpless', 'victim', 'spousal', 'abuse', 'face', 'pushy', 'demanding', 'fiancee', 'only', 'escape', 'tormentors', 'was', 'traveling', 'back', 'time', 'early', 'decades', 'twentieth', 'century', 'Paris', 'day-', 'purpose', 'night-dreams', 'lent', 'greater', 'support', 'bailing', 'pending', 'disastrous', 'real', 'world', 'daughter', 'family', 'cooperating', 'messing', 'up', 'new', 'blossoming', 'relationship', 'where', 'daughter', 'obsessed', 'fitting', 'new', 'fiancee', 'past', 'broken', 'romance', 'fictional', 'world', 'esacping', 'past', 'living', 'great', 'era', 'art', 'literature', 'France', 'twentieth', 'century', 'movie', 'painted', 'complex', 'struggle', 'writer', 'dreaming', 'reconcile', 'fictional', 'imagination', 'materialistic', 'fast', 'lifestyle', 'ordinary', 'people.The', 'fictional', 'night-dream', 'was', 'true', 'paradise', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'where', 'many', 'great', 'theories', 'plays', 'characters', 'acts', 'could', 'come', 'live', 'assure', 'struggling', 'victim', 'true', 'worthiness', 'universe', 'real', 'daily', 'world', 'filled', 'sun', 'light', 'made', 'characters', 'objects', 'appear', 'fake', 'artificial', 'victim', 'viewers', 'were', 'relieved', 'courage', 'fiance', 'end', 'hellish', 'relationship', 'sad', 'end', 'fictional', 'day-dreams', 'crashed', 'broken', 'romance']",N/A
1494857,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B005MYEPXC,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","This is the first time I've watched this Woody Allen film since its theatrical release in June, 2011.  I liked it then and I like it even more now.  Owen Wilson, subbing for a role Allen would normally play years ago, is Gil a successful screenwriter for U. S. television.  He doesn't like his job much and has been working on a book, hoping it will lead to a career as a novelist.  He has travelled to Paris with his fianc&eacute;e, Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents to make wedding arrangements.Inez bumps into old acquaintances played by Michael Sheen and Nina Arianda.  Paul (Sheen) obviously has eyes for Inez that suggests a previous relationship.  He, Carol (Arianda) and Inez are looking to see the city and its environs but once exploring some of the sights, Paul's arrogance and smugness comes into play.  In one scene he argues with a museum guide (former first lady of France Carla Bruni) about which woman was the wife of a famous artist and which was the mistress.  Gil, who's had enough of Paul's I'm-always-right pontificating says he just finished the biography of Rodin and the guide is correct.  Of course he hadn't.This all leads up to Gil's solo night time strolls through the neighborhoods of Paris.  At the stroke of midnight he is magically taken back to the 1920's, an era of Hemingway, Dali, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Picasso and others.  He also meets Adriana (Marion Cotillard), one of Picasso's lovers.  They have an immediate attraction, but in this fantasy world, time is fleeting.When I saw this film the first time around, I spent too much time trying to figure out the time travel component of the film.  Is this a dream?  Is Gil hallucinating? Is there another world occupying the space?  Forget about it.  This time, I just considered it movie magic and enjoyed the show.  Allen's script is terrific, especially when all the famous characters get to do their thing.  Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein, Corey Stoll as Ernest Hemingway and the seemingly everywhere now, Tom Hiddleston as Scott Fitzgerald are especially noteworthy.  Allen opens the film with some 4 to 5 minutes of beautiful dusk to dawn shots of Paris.  The City of Lights is another character in this wonderful character driven film.The Blu ray version of this film is transferred in 1.78:1 and 1080p.  Paris looks great.  Allen focuses on a color palet of yellow, brown and gold hues.  The night time scenes sparkle with all the Parisian lights.  Like most Woody Allen films the audio soundtrack is nothing special.  Delivered in DTS-HD Master Audio 3.0, everything is up front.  It might have been nice to have the surrounds in play in that there is a good deal of club scenes in addition to the soundtrack.  Still, it's not a big deal.

1494861,A221STPP9GQFXB,B005MYEPXC,Musette,"[9, 20]","Warning: spoilers belowI was so looking forward to finally seeing Midnight in Paris, after I had read and heard so much about it. I found it a disappointment, mainly because it was just what I had expected and nothing more. There is so much more to the real Paris, not just the standard sights and conceptions and obsessions with impressionism, post-impressionism, the early modern writings of Americans who went to Paris to write and drink during Prohibition. All the cliches are there and there is nothing new, not even the concept of falsely worshipping the past. The past is distorted here in so many ways. First, just when in the 1920s is that part of the film set? Fitzgerald, Hemingway (did he really talk like that?), Picasso, Bunuel, Degas, Matisse, Modigliani, Dali, Josephine Baker and just about everyone else Woody Allen could come up with in the film and all at the same time in that decade:  oh look, there's so and so and then there's so and so. The female extras wear styles of the early 20s, all except for the childish character of Marion Cotillard who wishes only to go back to La Belle Epoque. She isn't even wearing an authentic late-20s dress, it's too short (again a false cliche) and is really something from today (today being defined as the still-1960s lasting 40 years after its zenith). The 1890s folk at Maxims (Degas, was it?) comment on how pretty the dress was -- she would have been arrested or at least asked to leave Maxims for wearing it then. Instead she's offered a designing job. After all, didn't she assist Chanel thirty years in the future? And do we always need a cliche cancan? And what is with that hearse that comes to pick little Marion up? How were her memoirs published and why? That may be the low point of the movie. I was embarrassed for Cotillard because she had been so wonderful as Edith Piaf and she ends up in this junk. And the tune Parlez-moi d'amour played repeatedly at the end ... it was written in 1930 (look it up on Wikipedia). Now for Owen Wilson, who acts here so much like Woody Allen himself that he must be his alter ego. Wilson says in the Cannes interview on the disc that Allen left him alone to develop his own character. That is so hard to believe because he is imitating Woody Allen, with his whining and and confusion. This mirror portrayal is really spooky. Also, why do later disc boxes replace the Paris sky shown at first with Van Gogh's Starry Night and then add Rachel McAdams to Wilson's stroll along the Seine? Is she such a big star that Wilson needs her to sell the story? Allen said he wanted her because she was so beautiful and, oh year, also, a good actress, as is Wilson. If they truly are so great, it doesn't show up here. Her parents were the obnoxious right-wing cliches. Carla Bruni is a stick, physically and in her ""acting"". Pure vanity. Kathy Bates' Gertrude Stein was the highlight of the film, as she often is, and lent a little class to this mess.",2,A disappointing collection of cliches,1325721600,"01 5, 2012",2012,2951,"['Warning', 'spoilers', 'belowI', 'was', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'finally', 'seeing', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'had', 'read', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'found', 'disappointment', 'mainly', 'was', 'just', 'what', 'had', 'expected', 'nothing', 'more', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'real', 'Paris', 'not', 'just', 'standard', 'sights', 'conceptions', 'obsessions', 'impressionism', 'post-impressionism', 'early', 'modern', 'writings', 'Americans', 'who', 'went', 'Paris', 'write', 'drink', 'Prohibition', 'cliches', 'are', 'there', 'nothing', 'new', 'not', 'even', 'concept', 'falsely', 'worshipping', 'past', 'past', 'distorted', 'here', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'First', 'just', 'when', '1920s', 'part', 'film', 'set', 'Fitzgerald', 'Hemingway', 'did', 'really', 'talk', 'Picasso', 'Bunuel', 'Degas', 'Matisse', 'Modigliani', 'Dali', 'Josephine', 'Baker', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'decade', 'oh', 'look', 'so', 'so', 'then', 'so', 'so', 'female', 'extras', 'wear', 'styles', 'early', '20s', 'childish', 'character', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'who', 'only', 'go', 'back', 'La', 'Belle', 'Epoque', ""n't"", 'even', 'wearing', 'authentic', 'late-20s', 'dress', 'too', 'short', 'again', 'false', 'cliche', 'really', 'something', 'today', 'today', 'being', 'defined', 'still-1960s', 'lasting', '40', 'years', 'zenith', '1890s', 'folk', 'Maxims', 'Degas', 'was', 'comment', 'how', 'pretty', 'dress', 'was', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'arrested', 'least', 'asked', 'leave', 'Maxims', 'wearing', 'then', 'Instead', 'offered', 'designing', 'job', 'did', ""n't"", 'assist', 'Chanel', 'thirty', 'years', 'future', 'do', 'always', 'need', 'cliche', 'cancan', 'what', 'hearse', 'pick', 'little', 'Marion', 'up', 'How', 'were', 'memoirs', 'published', 'why', 'may', 'be', 'low', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'embarrassed', 'Cotillard', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'wonderful', 'Edith', 'Piaf', 'up', 'junk', 'tune', 'Parlez-moi', ""d'amour"", 'played', 'repeatedly', 'end', 'was', 'written', '1930', 'look', 'up', 'Wikipedia', 'Now', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'who', 'here', 'so', 'much', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'must', 'be', 'alter', 'ego', 'Wilson', 'Cannes', 'interview', 'disc', 'Allen', 'left', 'alone', 'develop', 'own', 'character', 'so', 'hard', 'believe', 'imitating', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'whining', 'confusion', 'mirror', 'portrayal', 'really', 'spooky', 'Also', 'why', 'do', 'later', 'disc', 'boxes', 'replace', 'Paris', 'sky', 'shown', 'first', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'Starry', 'Night', 'then', 'add', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'Wilson', 'stroll', 'Seine', 'big', 'star', 'Wilson', 'sell', 'story', 'Allen', 'said', 'wanted', 'was', 'so', 'beautiful', 'oh', 'year', 'also', 'good', 'actress', 'Wilson', 'truly', 'are', 'so', 'great', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'here', 'parents', 'were', 'obnoxious', 'right-wing', 'cliches', 'Carla', 'Bruni', 'stick', 'physically', 'acting', 'Pure', 'vanity', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Gertrude', 'Stein', 'was', 'highlight', 'film', 'often', 'lent', 'little', 'class', 'mess']",N/A

We wonder how life would have been in the last century, or in the Antiquity, in Rome, Egypt or even Paris?Woody Allen must have had that fantasy, too, and he has the means to at least put it onto celluloid, so that he can share it with us. The story line is lighthearted, and that is a good thing. After all, fantasy travel is not real! In this story, our hero tackles more than one issue: his personal life (should he or should he not marry his rich-Daddy girlfriend?), his professional life (should he remain a fast-writing Hollywood slave or become a serious author?) his life style (Malibu Beach or Paris?)...and luckily for him, the time-travel fairies smile upon him, allowing him to slip into the 20s, and meet now famous people, whom he admires, in person, helping him reflect on the goals in his life and solve his conundrums.I can assure you, if I had a chance to meet Picasso, Monet, Rodin, Gertrude Stein and Ernest Hemingway up close and personal, I'd be gone in a heartbeat!

He's never dished blockbuster helpings, which obviously implies that most moviegoers haven't taken the time to encounter him. I suspect Midnight in Paris will be an exception to the rule. If you're curious but ultimately intimidated to scoop Allen's macaroni salad onto your cinematic cafeteria plate, then Paris is a thoughtful starting point.Owen Wilson plays a successful yet unsatisfied go-to Hollywood scriptwriter with a Beverly Hills home and beautiful fianc&eacute;e whose future business minded in-laws can't perceive his soul's ambitions apart from seven digit paychecks. So begins the films initial conflict when Wilson's only desire is to abandon scriptwriting, move into a Paris studio and polish up his first independent novel.Here's his handicap. Wilson's a romantic. He believes Paris' nineteen-twenties past is superior to his twenty-first century present. So begins solo late night walks, and unmistakably when the magic happens. I think most viewers will criticize his unbelieving fianc&eacute;e and in-laws for not taking lamp-lit strolls with him, but Wilson's a writer. The magic, and his eventual rebirth, as proposed in Midnight, could only happen in the alleyways of his solitude.-Noel J Hadley",4,Well worth staying up tomidnight,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,1318,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'kind', 'like', 'black', 'coffee', 'love', 'keep', 'decaffeinated', 'distance', 'never', 'dished', 'blockbuster', 'helpings', 'obviously', 'most', 'moviegoers', 'have', ""n't"", 'taken', 'time', 'encounter', 'suspect', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'will', 'be', 'exception', 'rule', ""'re"", 'curious', 'ultimately', 'intimidated', 'scoop', 'Allen', 'macaroni', 'salad', 'cinematic', 'cafeteria', 'plate', 'then', 'Paris', 'thoughtful', 'starting', 'point.Owen', 'Wilson', 'successful', 'yet', 'unsatisfied', 'go-to', 'Hollywood', 'scriptwriter', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'home', 'beautiful', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'future', 'business', 'minded', 'in-laws', 'ca', ""n't"", 'perceive', 'soul', 'ambitions', 'apart', 'seven', 'digit', 'paychecks', 'So', 'films', 'initial', 'conflict', 'when', 'Wilson', 'only', 'desire', 'abandon', 'scriptwriting', 'move', 'Paris', 'studio', 'polish', 'up', 'first', 'independent', 'novel.Here', 'handicap', 'Wilson', 'romantic', 'Paris', 'nineteen-twenties', 'past', 'superior', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'present', 'solo', 'late', 'night', 'walks', 'unmistakably', 'when', 'magic', 'think', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'criticize', 'unbelieving', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'in-laws', 'not', 'taking', 'lamp-lit', 'strolls', 'Wilson', 'writer', 'magic', 'eventual', 'rebirth', 'proposed', 'Midnight', 'could', 'only', 'happen', 'alleyways', 'solitude.-Noel', 'J', 'Hadley']",N/A

1494870,A13FBTZ8SO8T3D,B005MYEPXC,o dubhthaigh,"[8, 31]","I miss Woody Allen. I really do. I think somebody doppelganged him after Zelig and there's been an impostor making the same film over and over and over and, well, now they are all blond with California accents as though the Beach Boys embody the same neuroses that New Yawkahs carry with pride. Having seen this today, I said to the missus that I felt like I was watching a two hour episode of Seinfeld. It's a movie that isn't about anything other than showing you how good Paris looks when you can recite the script as the story unfolds. What this has going for it is that it is infinitely better than Veni, Vidi, Vicki Barcelona. Anyone who makes a movie with Penelope Cruz that sucks deserves to be locked in an elevator with Tom Cruise for all of eternity.Paris upstages the script here in every frame. The only time it gets it wrong is when Carla Bruni pops in as cemetery tour guide. She's a cardboard cut out that affords Allen bragging rights that he got the ex-mistress of Clapton and now Mrs Sarkozy in a cameo. She's neither funny nor sexy, just there, like the shrubbery. And then there is the way Paris is filmed, it's pleasant and certainly reminiscent of better films shot in Paris, most notably Before Sunset. My guess is that it was shot in Spring.I tend to think that Owen Wilson is one of the very worst actors in the world. However, he almost takes the role of ersatz-Nebbish someplace other. There are great stretches in the film when he's his own man, and at those points, he rises above what has always seemed to be his stoned and pathetic persona. When the script reduces him to the aforementioned bleached out Upper East side spoiled neurotic, the film misses a great opportunity to break free from the Allen-esque cliches that showcase Woody on auto-pilot. All his basic tricks are still there: superficial references to psycho-analyses and existentialism delivered in opposition to a Tony Roberts stand in; relationships that are flat out wrong; cultural disconnects that vaguely echo the great dysfunctions of Annie Hall's family; prurient interests in wild sexual encounters. Wilson seems ready to take these tried and true formulas out for a ride, but inevitably you hear Woody behind the character Wilson plays, and frankly, that's a shame, most especially for Allen.Vicki was a film for the daughters of especially spoiled Americans who haven't a clue how good they have it. This film returns the focus to the parents. Not sure it's so easy to relate to the angst of those who can't decide whether to buy, buy, buy, in Paris, crap they have no place for, for the exclusive reason that it's expensive and it's Paris and you can't get this crap back home, even in Crap Depot, i.e. LA. Yes, that's the existentialist point of conspicuous consumption, but those kinda empty calories have been trotted out so many times, they've lost their bite.Before Sunset accomplished a number of things Allen's film might have taken up and expanded upon, not the least of which is the nature of relationships in a world whose certainties have become fleeting. A long time ago, that was Woody's court. The tricks of time that the film plays with are imaginative, but serve only as tricks, and an excuse for a bit of Marie Antoinette slapstick. Before Sunset ran in real time, and made its points with a whallop you wish Allen could muster again.One of the other cliches attendant upon an Allen film is that all of the senior citizens in the audience applaud as the credits roll. It's polite applause. The kind of applause you make when you haven't been either challenged or offended. The latter is honourable, the former tragic. Allen is capable of a better and funnier film than this. Maybe he'll make it.",3,"Same zip code, different backdrop.",1307836800,"06 12, 2011",2011,3721,"['miss', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'really', 'do', 'think', 'somebody', 'doppelganged', 'Zelig', 'been', 'impostor', 'making', 'same', 'film', 'well', 'now', 'are', 'blond', 'California', 'accents', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'embody', 'same', 'neuroses', 'New', 'Yawkahs', 'carry', 'pride', 'Having', 'seen', 'today', 'said', 'missus', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'two', 'hour', 'episode', 'Seinfeld', 'movie', ""n't"", 'anything', 'other', 'showing', 'how', 'good', 'Paris', 'when', 'can', 'recite', 'script', 'story', 'unfolds', 'What', 'going', 'infinitely', 'better', 'Veni', 'Vidi', 'Vicki', 'Barcelona', 'Anyone', 'who', 'movie', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'deserves', 'be', 'locked', 'elevator', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'eternity.Paris', 'script', 'here', 'frame', 'only', 'time', 'wrong', 'when', 'Carla', 'Bruni', 'cemetery', 'tour', 'guide', 'cardboard', 'cut', 'out', 'affords', 'Allen', 'bragging', 'rights', 'got', 'ex-mistress', 'Clapton', 'now', 'Mrs', 'Sarkozy', 'cameo', 'funny', 'sexy', 'just', 'there', 'shrubbery', 'then', 'way', 'Paris', 'filmed', 'pleasant', 'certainly', 'reminiscent', 'better', 'films', 'shot', 'Paris', 'most', 'notably', 'Sunset', 'guess', 'was', 'shot', 'Spring.I', 'tend', 'think', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'one', 'very', 'worst', 'actors', 'world', 'However', 'almost', 'role', 'ersatz-Nebbish', 'someplace', 'other', 'are', 'great', 'stretches', 'film', 'when', 'own', 'man', 'points', 'what', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'stoned', 'pathetic', 'persona', 'When', 'script', 'aforementioned', 'bleached', 'out', 'Upper', 'East', 'side', 'spoiled', 'neurotic', 'film', 'great', 'opportunity', 'break', 'free', 'Allen-esque', 'cliches', 'showcase', 'Woody', 'auto-pilot', 'basic', 'tricks', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'superficial', 'references', 'psycho-analyses', 'existentialism', 'delivered', 'opposition', 'Tony', 'Roberts', 'stand', 'relationships', 'are', 'flat', 'wrong', 'cultural', 'disconnects', 'vaguely', 'echo', 'great', 'dysfunctions', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'family', 'prurient', 'interests', 'wild', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'Wilson', 'ready', 'take', 'tried', 'true', 'formulas', 'out', 'ride', 'inevitably', 'hear', 'Woody', 'character', 'Wilson', 'frankly', 'shame', 'most', 'especially', 'Allen.Vicki', 'was', 'film', 'daughters', 'especially', 'spoiled', 'Americans', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'clue', 'how', 'good', 'have', 'film', 'focus', 'parents', 'Not', 'sure', 'so', 'easy', 'relate', 'angst', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'buy', 'buy', 'buy', 'Paris', 'crap', 'have', 'place', 'exclusive', 'reason', 'expensive', 'Paris', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'crap', 'back', 'home', 'even', 'Crap', 'Depot', 'i.e', 'LA', 'Yes', 'existentialist', 'point', 'conspicuous', 'consumption', 'kinda', 'empty', 'calories', 'have', 'been', 'trotted', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'bite.Before', 'Sunset', 'accomplished', 'number', 'things', 'Allen', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'taken', 'up', 'expanded', 'upon', 'not', 'least', 'nature', 'relationships', 'world', 'certainties', 'have', 'become', 'fleeting', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'was', 'Woody', 'court', 'tricks', 'time', 'film', 'plays', 'are', 'imaginative', 'serve', 'only', 'tricks', 'excuse', 'bit', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'slapstick', 'Sunset', 'ran', 'real', 'time', 'made', 'points', 'whallop', 'wish', 'Allen', 'could', 'muster', 'again.One', 'other', 'cliches', 'attendant', 'Allen', 'film', 'senior', 'citizens', 'audience', 'applaud', 'credits', 'roll', 'polite', 'applause', 'kind', 'applause', 'make', 'when', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'either', 'challenged', 'offended', 'latter', 'honourable', 'former', 'tragic', 'Allen', 'capable', 'better', 'funnier', 'film', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'make']",N/A

Woody Allen is a master of emotional directing. Every movie of his has warmth that many directors seem to leave out or forget about. His movies are very real and we don't doubt what is happening, no matter what the situation is. He captures the character and finds ways for the viewer to relate and contrast to ourselves and what we've wanted or how we've felt.Midnight in Paris is a very simple movie. As like other Woody Allen films you must be open minded and not get too wrapped up in scientific fact. Simply enjoy the film. This movie is very well designed and simply has a wonderful flow to it which makes it quite pleasing to the audience. I never really reached a slow down-point in this film where I was simply waiting for it to end. I was hooked from the beginning and was very fascinated throughout the film.The Blu-ray is very nice looking and has a soft warm tone on the spectrum. This greatly complements the movie, as a cold sharp picture would completely have ruined the feel. The audio is clear however not as crisp as it could have been.

I was a huge fan of his work in the late 60's and the 1970's but for the most part Woody kinda lost me after that. Several weeks ago a friend called me raving about ""Midnight In Paris"". He didn't tell me a whole lot about it but assured me that I would love it. I took the day off today and one of the things on my ""to do"" list was to check out this flick. I went to an 11:15 A.M. screening this morning and although there only about 10 people in the theater I wanted to stand up and cheer when they rolled the credits. For me ""Midnight In Paris"" was a sheer delight.  In fact, this is a film that I would definitely like to see again.""Midnight In Paris"" stars Owen Wilson as aspiring novelist Gil Pender and Rachel McAdams as his lovely fiancee Inez.  The couple are visiting ""The CIty of Light"" with Inez's parents.  Gil and Inez seem very much in love as the film opens but cracks quickly begin to develop in the relationship.  Gil is a successful Hollywood screenwriter who has simply become bored with his work and dreams of living and working in Paris the way the great artists and writers of the 1920's did.  Inez has other ideas.  She longs for the glamorous life in Malibu with all of the amenities.  Inez is definitely going to be high maintenance.  Gil feels at one with this place and wants to explore the streets of the city and savor the essence of Paris.  Inez prefers to go off with friends and take in the art galleries and museums.  They are slowly drifting apart.  Gil's life would forever change one evening when at the stroke of midnight a limo pulls up alongside him and the occupants invite him to join them.  Suddenly and remarkably Gil finds himself  smack dab in the middle of the 1920's Paris he has always read and dreamed of.  Furthermore he has the opportunity to meet and greet several of the legendary figures who were living in Paris at that time.  That list would include writers Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and T.S. Eliot, the legendary songwriter Cole Porter along with jazz great Josephine Baker and a group of artists including Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and Paul Gauguin.  Gil desperately wants to show Inez what he has been experiencing but only he is allowed to enter into this bizarre netherworld.  During his travels Gil also meets a ravishing young lady named Adriana (Marion Cotillard) with whom he has much in common.  Here finally is a place where he feels fulfilled.  Meanwhile, as you might expect all of these improbable events do not bode well for the future of Gil and Inez's relationship.I simply cannot overstate how much I enjoyed ""Midnight In Paris"".  The views of Paris both during the day and at night were nothing short of stunning.  The photography alone is worth the price of admission.

His movies in the last several years never let me down and I was looking forward to his new shot at comedy.  In this film there is assembly of great actors who give fabulous performances and their renditions of famous people who lived in Paris in 1920s: Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Gertrude Stein, Matisse, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, to name a few.  The main character is an American Holywood screenplay writer on his trip to Paris daydreaming about abandoning his life in Malibu for a cozy little attic apartment in Paris.  Surely, his American fiancee, does not feel the same.  She just cannot comprehend why woudl anyone abandon big house in Malibu for small attic in Paris.  If American in Paris is a culture clash, than match between this Holywood screenwriter and his fiancee is definitely not match made in haven.Surely, Woody uses his alter ego in this new character of a writer and it fits the story perfectly.  Owen Wilson is perfect choice for the role.  Supporting cast includes: Marion Cottilard, Carla Bruni. Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates, Michael Sheen to name a few.

Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[1, 1]","My respect and appreciation for Woody Allen as a director and screenwriter is fully restored after seeing this movie. It is a gem; one of his best. The protagonist, Gil Pender, is a screenwriter who is nostalgic about Paris and the Lost Generation of the 20s; and is writing his first novel, using Paris as an inspiration. He is engaged to Inez, and while they appear to be in love w/each other, their interests move in divergent directions. They meet up with Paul Bates and his wife; Paul being a self-appointed expert of all things French. Inez is attracted to him, but he is an insufferable know-it-all to Gil. Inez, Paul and his wife decide to go dancing one night, but Gil begs off and walks back to his hotel. Getting lost, he stops to rest and just after midnight, an antique auto with group of revelers in 20s garb, stops to pick him up. He is magically transported to the 20s and meets and befriends famous members of the Lost Generation, including the Fitzgeralds, Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso; etc...and Picasso's beautiful mistress at the time, Adriana. He is immediately attracted to Adriana and Stein agrees to review his novel. Inez and Gil, increasingly grow apart and Gil becomes increasingly attracted to his real, but ultimately fantasy world of the 20s...and he is falling in love with Adriana. That will set the stage nicely; if you are intrigued so far, watch this fine movie and see how it plays out. look for exceptionally fine performances by Owen Wilson as Gil; Rachel McAdams, as Inez; Michael Sheen as the insufferable Paul Bates. Among the Lost Generation, Marion Cotillard delivers her usual fine performance as Adriana and Kathy Bates and Corey Stoll are standouts as Stein and Hemingway. Also look for Carla Bruni as the museum guide and Lea Seydoux, a nostalgia dealer that Gil befriends.

Woody has given up on his idea of promoting New York City, and has drifted to Europe. He apparently has found new inspiration with Paris. This lovely fantasy serves him well with the history and its potential. His customary love of music is period-perfect, and the cleverness of the script is a testament that this man's creativity still thrives.Owen Wilson whines mercilessly at the beginning, and Rachel McAdams is as vapid a rich-bitch as can be, but once Wilson finds his inspiration, he embraces it without reservation, indeed, accepting that he was born at the wrong time. The characterizations are good, and there are enough surprises along the way to make this a most enjoyable romp.I don't understand how the Indie Spirit awards work, since Woody wasn't mentioned at all, and the guy who plays Hemingway was nommed for Supp Actor (he was very fine), the film's only nom.I'm glad to have seen this film, and, with the exception of ""Vicky C.B."", Woody hasn't entertained me as much in many years.

1494897,A2U0ABMZK6XBVF,B005MYEPXC,"Richard A. Tucker ""Tucker at large""","[1, 1]","As the tale unfolded so did the power of the story. It's fun to imagine great 'what ifs' like those revealed here from very early in the film, but to see them come to their logical conclusions without beating the viewer over the head is why Woody Allen is still such a gifted film maker.Owen Wilson's character is such an average guy that even his wardrobe is boring, too sensible and while well made it's also indistinct. That matters because it's a reflection of the character who has such extraordinary experiences that he becomes both a focus and a kind of background. His soon to be wife seems all right if a little overbearing, and unimaginative, but she dresses in style, she's sexy and young and has no problem showing it. Unfortunately where her clothing and attitude are more provocative her mind is drab, as are her ambitions. As the couple meets with friends and family in Paris the city is revealed as both an escape and a dream though still grounded in it's daylight and late evening hours with the occasionally rude waiter or brusque citizen, just like all large cities. The fantasy lies in the situation and not on misguided ideals.When Wilson's character discovers a secret about about the city at midnight he's not sure what to make of the revelation but simply notes the oddness and goes with it. He probably accepts things as they are because in many ways he is living out what were fantasies now becoming a reality he should not be able to see, much less experience.The trick of an experienced reality -as it is utilized in this construct- is that it impresses itself upon you as another layer of actual life and not as a delusion. Not only do you want to believe it, it almost has an inherent sense to it. That is where the premise succeeds where so many other attempts to do this in other films fail.As the night life absorbs more of Wilson's character's interest the more effort he makes to balance out the two worlds, at least at first. The new reality also begins to show the rifts in the daylight life. Small ones we often take for granted are suddenly more obvious but also acceptable. His interaction with the noteworthy denizens of Paris' late evening crowd becomes a given, like he has two lives to live.All I can conclude is how well this worked for me as well as the perfectly imperfect conclusion. It doesn't wrap up so much as it provides a stepping stone for the characters and audience to move on.I like the running observations of the two prevailing views of Paris expressed by the characters because this is how a lot of Americans react to the city. I admit that I fall in the category that finds the city to be somewhat magical, even in it's reality and imperfections.

Owen Wilson does whine a lot, and comes off as be an uninspiring, one dimensional, and wimpy figure. Within minutes of the opening of the film, Allen's ""neurosis"" pops out. It's the same old stuff - nothing really matters after all because everyone dies. World without hope or, in this film, struggling to find it.

Crawford,"[6, 9]","This is the kind of work that I loved about Woody Allen:  a bit surreal (or reality bending), with a quirky humor and yet some psychological depth. All in all, a very good story.  It reminded me in particular of his earlier Alice, with her invisibility and yet keen realizations about the state of her life, even her soul.The narrative starts with a young writer who is in Paris with his fiancee and her family.  He is a hollywood screenwriter, but longs to be a novelist and sees Paris as a wonderfully fertile place to realize his dreams, to nourish a self that he hopes is somewhere within him.  It is perhaps his last chance before embarking on a life that would trap him.  His companions stand is such stark contrast that you wonder what he could possibly see in them:  the fiancee lacks imagination and feels no desire to take the chance of embracing a new culture, her mother is a crass materialist who views Paris as a shopping mall, and the father is a Tea Party fat cat full of paranoia and a fatally narrow mind.  The only thing I would imagine he sees in the her is perfect sex.  The American friends they meet are hardly better, including a pedantic and shallow professor whom his fiancee ridiculously idolizes, reducing the guy to snide sarcasms.So the stage is set for a life drama.  What then happens - the guy repeatedly travels back in time to meet his idols in the Paris of the 1920s, even accepting Hemingway's advice and passing a manuscript to Gertrude Stein for her opinion - evokes the magic of Paris better than any film I have seen in several decades.  It is like he is in a dream, but at the same time he meets the stunningly beautiful and slightly decadent Marion Cotillard as a mistress of Picasso, and his feelings for her get him to question everything he is about to do even more.  It works emotionally and was completely believable while I saw it.In fact, the film also touched a chord in me:  I did go to Paris after college and tried to live a life similar to the one he imagines, complete with an obsession about the same writers and artists who appear in the past.  It was a time of magic, experimentation and dreams and it completely changed my life.  Allen plays with these themes to perfection in the film, even in the reactions of his awful companions, who simply can't see what he does, even in his enjoyment of the city in the rain.Warmly recommended.  This is the first film of Allen's that I unequivocally enjoyed since my circle of friends rejected him after the Mia Farrow debacle.

1494908,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B005MYEPXC,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 5]","Like the man at the movie`s core, I was hoping to be transported to a different time and place while watching Woody Allen`s universally acclaimed ""Midnight in Paris.""  What I got instead was a sporadically charming but surprisingly earthbound little fantasy that had me pining away over lost opportunities with the Lost Generation.The conceit - not terribly original in and of itself but filled with promise and possibilities - involves an American writer visiting modern-day Paris who is whisked away every midnight to the 1920s where he hobnobs with many of the great writers, artists and thinkers of the time: F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway, Josephine Baker, Alice B. Toklas, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, and others.So far, so good.  Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is portrayed as a hopeless romantic who, as we are too often wont to do, believes that life was better in a time before he was born - an idealized era where life was richer, simpler and somehow more satisfying than it is today.  For Gil, that ideal period is the Paris of the 1920s, which he envisions as a scene of endless literary and intellectual discussions amongst a rarified elite.  He's engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams), a much more prosaic 21st Century woman, whose father (Kurt Fuller) is a right-wing tea-party type and whose mother (Mimi Kennedy) looks with disdain on her daughter's life choices, including the man she`s picked to marry.  No wonder Gil rushes back every night to that space/time continuum portal that allows him to be with the people he really likes and who seem to like and understand him.The main problem for me with ""Midnight in Paris"" is that it is unable to bring its roster of extraordinary historical figures to life.  In fact, they emerge basically as some of the blandest people you are ever likely to meet, this century or last.  They wouldn't even make a good cocktail party crowd.  Not one of them says anything insightful or witty that would in any way indicate that they are world-famous artists and creators of lasting works.  And without that dimension, Gil's trips to the past have all the excitement and authenticity of a dress-up ball that never ends.The scenes set in the present are scarcely any better.  Inez' family and their pompous, know-it-all friend, played by Michael Sheen, are just the Ugly American writ large, and the humor is surprisingly toothless and lacking for a Woody Allen movie.  Wilson, who has been effective in other roles, here feels too much like a stand-in for a younger version of Allen himself to make much of an impression of his own.So what of the glorious views of Paris that one would expect from such a film?  Surely, those are worth the price of admission.  Actually, not really, for the cinematographer, Darius Khonji, has, for some inexplicable reason, seen fit to cast the city in a strangely sickly yellowish glow that robs the place of much of its natural beauty and luster.So what is good about the film?  Well, there are some genuinely tender moments between Gil and Adriana, the on-again/off-again mistress of Pablo Picasso, who suffers from Gil's idealization of the past, only to her, that rosier past lies in the era known as La Belle Epoque.  And there's a very funny in-movie scene in which Gil gives a bemused and befuddled Luis Bunuel the idea for what the surrealist will later turn into ""The Exterminating Angel.""  The movie also does a nice job fleshing out its theme - of the illusion of a Golden Age vs. the reality of a present day - in the final reel.More virtues like these and ""Midnight in Paris"" might have been the truly transporting charmer it was meant to be.",3,"Okay, but falls short of what it could have been",1346371200,"08 31, 2012",2012,3692,"['man', 'movie', 's', 'core', 'was', 'hoping', 'be', 'transported', 'different', 'time', 'place', 'watching', 'Woody', 'Allen', 's', 'universally', 'acclaimed', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'What', 'got', 'instead', 'was', 'sporadically', 'charming', 'surprisingly', 'earthbound', 'little', 'fantasy', 'had', 'pining', 'away', 'lost', 'opportunities', 'Lost', 'Generation.The', 'conceit', 'not', 'terribly', 'original', 'filled', 'promise', 'possibilities', 'American', 'writer', 'visiting', 'modern-day', 'Paris', 'who', 'whisked', 'away', 'midnight', '1920s', 'where', 'hobnobs', 'many', 'great', 'writers', 'artists', 'thinkers', 'time', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Zelda', 'Fitzgerald', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'Josephine', 'Baker', 'Alice', 'B.', 'Toklas', 'Gertrude', 'Stein', 'Pablo', 'Picasso', 'Salvador', 'Dali', 'Luis', 'Bunuel', 'others.So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'Gil', 'Pender', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'portrayed', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'often', 'wont', 'do', 'life', 'was', 'better', 'time', 'was', 'born', 'idealized', 'era', 'where', 'life', 'was', 'richer', 'simpler', 'somehow', 'more', 'satisfying', 'today', 'Gil', 'ideal', 'period', 'Paris', '1920s', 'scene', 'endless', 'literary', 'intellectual', 'discussions', 'amongst', 'rarified', 'elite', 'engaged', 'Inez', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'much', 'more', 'prosaic', '21st', 'Century', 'woman', 'father', 'Kurt', 'Fuller', 'right-wing', 'tea-party', 'type', 'mother', 'Mimi', 'Kennedy', 'disdain', 'daughter', 'life', 'choices', 'including', 'man', 's', 'picked', 'marry', 'wonder', 'Gil', 'back', 'night', 'space/time', 'continuum', 'portal', 'be', 'people', 'really', 'who', 'seem', 'like', 'understand', 'him.The', 'main', 'problem', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'unable', 'bring', 'roster', 'extraordinary', 'historical', 'figures', 'life', 'fact', 'emerge', 'basically', 'blandest', 'people', 'are', 'ever', 'likely', 'meet', 'century', 'last', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'good', 'cocktail', 'party', 'crowd', 'Not', 'one', 'anything', 'insightful', 'witty', 'would', 'way', 'indicate', 'are', 'world-famous', 'artists', 'creators', 'lasting', 'works', 'dimension', 'Gil', 'trips', 'past', 'have', 'excitement', 'authenticity', 'dress-up', 'ball', 'never', 'ends.The', 'scenes', 'set', 'present', 'are', 'scarcely', 'better', 'Inez', 'family', 'pompous', 'know-it-all', 'friend', 'played', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'are', 'just', 'Ugly', 'American', 'writ', 'large', 'humor', 'surprisingly', 'toothless', 'lacking', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'Wilson', 'who', 'been', 'effective', 'other', 'roles', 'here', 'too', 'much', 'stand-in', 'younger', 'version', 'Allen', 'make', 'much', 'impression', 'own.So', 'what', 'glorious', 'views', 'Paris', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'such', 'film', 'Surely', 'are', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'Actually', 'not', 'really', 'cinematographer', 'Darius', 'Khonji', 'inexplicable', 'reason', 'seen', 'fit', 'cast', 'city', 'strangely', 'sickly', 'yellowish', 'glow', 'place', 'much', 'natural', 'beauty', 'luster.So', 'what', 'good', 'film', 'Well', 'are', 'genuinely', 'tender', 'moments', 'Gil', 'Adriana', 'on-again/off-again', 'mistress', 'Pablo', 'Picasso', 'who', 'Gil', 'idealization', 'past', 'only', 'rosier', 'past', 'era', 'known', 'La', 'Belle', 'Epoque', 'very', 'funny', 'in-movie', 'scene', 'Gil', 'bemused', 'befuddled', 'Luis', 'Bunuel', 'idea', 'what', 'surrealist', 'will', 'later', 'turn', 'Exterminating', 'Angel', 'movie', 'also', 'nice', 'job', 'fleshing', 'out', 'theme', 'illusion', 'Golden', 'Age', 'reality', 'present', 'day', 'final', 'reel.More', 'virtues', 'Midnight', 'Paris', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'transporting', 'charmer', 'was', 'meant', 'be']",N/A

Midnight in Paris is his most recent effort and clearly a vast improvement over his previous ones.  The movie is well written --  at least the flashback scenes -- and the cinematography outstanding.  The film itself reflects Woody Allen's love affair with the decades between the end of WW I and WW II.  He showcases some of the litierary and artistic luminaries of the period although he presumes his audience is not only familiar with the works of these characters but of their peresonalities and history as well.  Consequently this film is probably wasted on much of todays audience who probably would not know who Zelda is much less her sad history or Gertrude Stein as well.  However, the Hemingway character is not only well done and well acted but gives some humor and authenticity to the flashbacks.  The lead character in the film does a good job but seems an unlikely candidate as an author of any talent or motivation.  But as usual in films coming out of Hollywood there has to be a villain and that villain must be a businessman and a Republican -- preferably some sort of extremist totally out of touch with civilization and taste. Woody just couldn't try something original like making the villain an extreme liberal so he throws in references to the Tea Party and Republicans as the Neanderthals they are in the eyes of the East Coast and Hollywood liberals  - real villains in his eyes.The movie itself gets off to a great start with an unlikely premise of time travel but that creates problems with the ending.  It seems obvious that whole point of the movie was to bring some of these characters to life in a contemporary environment but that complicated the ending which seemed very forced.  Overall this was a great improvement over recent Allen efforts.

Why would he want to settle on being an ordinary filmmaker, incapable of directing a film like this? Shudder to think!It was this past summer that I visited the theatres to see this film at the urging of a friend. I have enjoyed most of the films he's done in the past 10 years, so I was game. I wasn't even half an hour in before I fell head over heels in love with this film.First thing to note - the city of Paris is a character all its own. Glittering, beautiful, rich & elegant, Allen's cinematography brings the City of Lights to life. If you've ever been to Paris - or have longed to go like yours truly - watching this movie will make you want to return (or cash in your life savings to make the trek). Woody Allen has always had a long love affair with Paris, and his affection shows up in every shot of the city. Everything is awash with color and light. No washed out tones to be found anywhere.Paris aside, the film is absolutely magical. Owen Wilson is an actor who has never appealed to me. I have routinely found his comedies lacking humor, substance and style, and he's never been believable to me. I was completely surprised to find him not only charmingly genuine here, but completely loveable and relatable. Rachel McAdams is always fabulous, and this movie is no exception. There are many other wonderful actors showcased, most of them being unknown. Two standouts are Alison Pill (an extreme talent - watch out for her) and Corey Stoll. I won't spoil the story by telling you who they play; that's half the fun. If you're like me, you'll watch it for the first time and squeal with delight with each character's reveal. Let's just say you might want to brush up on your literature and art history prior to watching the film. I must say that immediately after leaving the theatre, I was ready to book my Air France ticket. Then I was brought back to reality when my finances came up and bit me in the nose.Well, I could go on and on, but I will spare you. Just do yourself a favor and watch this movie.

The ""reality"" was bad enough - the hapless man with the mean fiancee and her horrible parents (Ugly Americans, all of them), boring us all senseless with their monied friends and acquaintances, sneering at everything, and then onto the ""time travel"" part where we were treated to yet another set of cringe-inducing people, ex-patriot literati, including Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. This was unfortunate for me (others may disagree and likely do) because my opinion of the modern era of literature and sometimes art in general is that a great deal of it was produced by people like Hemingway and Fitzgerald, who had their heads stuck so far up their own boozy bums, it was a wonder that they were able to emerge long enough to screw their lives up so completely.

1494927,A3943KDQAJM85A,B005MYEPXC,Snow White,"[3, 4]","Woody Allen's 2011 endeavor, Midnight in Paris begins similarly to what you would expect of a Woody Allen picture. Shots of Paris in the morning, quirky music, shots of Paris in the afternoon, music continues, shots of Paris in the evening... I think you can assume the rest. However with Paris in the spotlight instead of Allen's beloved New York, you might expect an obvious loss of affection or romanticism, however there is none at all which is first and foremost a fantastic breath of fresh air.Our hero is Gil, that prototype Woody Allen, self-effacing and neurotic character we've come to know, lovingly played by a surprisingly well-suited Owen Wilson. As the story opens, we find Gil and his fiance Inez (Rachel McAdams) in Paris, along with his less than enthusiastic future in-laws quite openly butting heads in the city he adores and she loathes. Gil is a Hollywood writer who longs to write something more meaningful and has begun on a novel about a man working in a nostalgia shop, selling relics of a more beautiful time past that Gil has yet to find the nerve to let another soul read.Walking back from a wine tasting alone, it is than that magic happens to Gil when the clock strikes midnight and on the windy Parisian street ahead of him appears a gorgeous old car, that opens it's door for him and begins a trip to Paris in the 1920's that has Gil rubbing shoulders with the periods most beloved artists.It is easy to say that this film is formulaic, however I beg to differ. I found this film to be without a doubt my favorite of this year, and possibly my new favorite Woody Allen film. (And I mean that Annie Hall!)Owen Wilson is magnetic and enjoyable in a way I personally have never thought him to be, supported by a brilliant cast including the gorgeous Marion Cotillard, always brilliant Michael Sheen and Corey Stoll as Ernest Hemingway in a performance that absolutely elevated the entire film.It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but Midnight in Paris does something few other films have done by soloing out the true nature of everyone's desire to yearn to live in another time, to fantasize that we'd be happier and more well-suited there instead of where we happen to be. To see such a subject tackled without a shred of existential angst, instead that glimmer of understanding the need for escapism when we're afraid to face our own reality is nothing short of beautiful.",5,"Gil, just pay attention.

It's part-fantasy, part-romance, part-comedy, and part-time travel. And it brought back fond memories of American literature, film studies, and art history classes I had in college.The star of Allen's film is Owen Wilson, who plays Gil--a Hollywood screenwriter who is engaged to Inez (an awful materialistic blond beauty, played by Rachel McAdams). They are in Paris with her parents (who are as awful and materialistic as Inez). Gil wants to walk in the rain and soak up the romantic atmosphere of the city; Inez wants to shop and hang out in museums, and go dancing and wine-tasting with a couple, with the male an annoying, pedantic fellow. Gil really wants to finish his nostalgic novel and live in Paris, not go back to California and his movie scripts.Somehow, Gil winds up in the Paris of the 1920s--his ""golden age""--with Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Cole Porter, Salvador Dal&iacute;, Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, Man Ray, Josephine Baker, and others from the period. He even spends some time in the 1890s with Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.Wilson is wonderful as our romantic hero, as is Marion Cotillard, who plays Adriana (who has been a mistress of Pablo Picasso and Amedeo Modigliani). Also outstanding in other supporting roles are Kathy Bates (as Stein), Michael Sheen (as the pedantic character), Corey Stoll (as Hemingway), and Adrien Brody (as Dal&iacute;). And L&eacute;a Seydoux is charming as  Gabrielle (a love interest).This is a film that I will be sure to purchase when it comes out as a DVD.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[4, 4]","Writer/Director/Actor Woody Allen may have found the perfect actor to inhabit the roles that he used to fill himself in his comedies like Annie Hall and Manhattan. That actor is Owen Wilson, who he discovered - along with Wilson's co-star in this film, Rachel McAdams - in the film ""Wedding Crashers"" (of all places). When Wilson spouts some of Allen's dialogue about not understanding his place in the world, you can hear the rhythm of Allen's speech pattern. And, like Allen, Wilson may be the male lead but he's not the normal ""handsome star"".This film could very well be considered Allen's French equivalent to ""Manhattan"" - his love letter to New York City. This time it is Paris and there are more exterior scenes than interior ones. In fact, for the first four minutes, Allen shows us typical street scenes in Paris with no actors or dialogue; just a 30s jazz instrumental with Sidney Bechet on clarinet (Allen's own instrument of choice.). The plot takes Wilson - in a fragile relationship with his fianc&eacute;e McAdams (who is a very demanding - and not very flexible - flirtatious debutante or the equivalent).- on a time travel journey (at midnight every night) to meet with the artists and thinkers of the literary and art world. There are Gertrude Stein, Cole Porter, Hemmingway, Picasso, Dali and more. It helps a bit if the viewer knows something about F. Scott Fitzgerald and his Zelda, as well as placing Stein in her Paris years with Alice B. Toklas - but it's not necessary.I've drifted away from Allen films lately but this one surely brought me back and I'm looking forward already to his next film.The images in the film are beautiful but not sharp. This is on purpose since - as you learn in the brief 5-minute Press Conference at Cannes, which is the only real bonus feature (besides the Trailer- cast bios are on the BD) on both the Standard and BluRay DVDs- Allen wanted the film to have subtle colors with brown being the dominant one. (Remember he filmed ""Manhattan"" in black and white!). Others at the Press Conference are Wilson, McAdams and Adrian Brody, who plays Dali in the film.)

And Allen makes full use of the camera to capture glimpses of such in the opening few minutes as we traverse the streets and boulevards taking in all of the well-known sights and tourist spots before encountering our hero and his intended, Inez (Rachel McAdams),demonstrating in the first few seconds of dialogue why they&#8217;re future is so obviously not together:  he&#8217;s an unrepentant romantic; she&#8217;s an unrepentant materialist.  This view is swiftly supported when we meet her odious parents played to perfection by Mimi Kennedy and Kurt Fuller.Gil is a frustrated novelist trapped within the creative constraints of being a well-paid Hollywood script writer so that he can support his well-heeled fianc&eacute; in the manner to which she&#8217;s become accustomed.  His sense of frustration increases by simply being in The City of Light, enveloped by the sense of other times, particularly, the Paris of the twenties, during which such eminent cultural American ex-pats such as Gertrude Stein, Scott-Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway moved.  This sense is given seeming physical reality when, preferring to walk home after a night out with his fianc&eacute; and her particularly boorish ex-lecturer/friend, Paul (Michael Sheen), Gil encounters the twentieth Century equivalent of Cinderella&#8217;s coach, which sweeps him off into the magical world of his fantasies where he meets and is befriended by all of his cultural ex-pat heroes in a soiree at Stein&#8217;s apartment.  Almost needless to say, this has serious implications for his impending nuptials.It&#8217;s all a bit too obviously contrived from the increasingly irritating accordion-based soundtrack to the increasingly clich&eacute;d postcard depictions of Paris and the audience cannot help but be aware of how the script seeks to manipulate the viewer to ascribe to the view that the fianc&eacute; and her parents are philistines that need to be dumped by the always affable Wilson.  This is conveniently reinforced by the equally odious Sheen by whom Inez is bafflingly enamoured.Ultimately, it&#8217;s a harmless and pleasant enough travelogue through space-time: Wilson does his best to impersonate a more youthful Woody, Paris is green and lovely and we all get to agree about the cosily correct decisions Gil makes in trying to sort out his future.It&#8217;s not one of Woody&#8217;s best and if you want a bit more invention in the same geographical location try or go back to Amelie!",4,Why oh why do I love Paris?,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,2711,"['Basically', '8217', 's', 'essentially', 'theme', 'park', 'adults', 'Owen', 'Wilson', '8217', 's', 'character', 'Gil', 'Pender', 'wonders', 'street', 'one', 'down', 'are', 'always', 'fresh', 'always', 'stimulating', 'words', 'effect', 'Allen', 'full', 'use', 'camera', 'capture', 'glimpses', 'such', 'opening', 'few', 'minutes', 'traverse', 'streets', 'boulevards', 'taking', 'well-known', 'sights', 'tourist', 'spots', 'encountering', 'hero', 'intended', 'Inez', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'demonstrating', 'first', 'few', 'seconds', 'dialogue', 'why', '8217', 're', 'future', 'so', 'obviously', 'not', 'together', '8217', 'unrepentant', 'romantic', '8217', 'unrepentant', 'materialist', 'view', 'swiftly', 'supported', 'when', 'meet', 'odious', 'parents', 'played', 'perfection', 'Mimi', 'Kennedy', 'Kurt', 'Fuller.Gil', 'frustrated', 'novelist', 'trapped', 'creative', 'constraints', 'being', 'well-paid', 'Hollywood', 'script', 'writer', 'so', 'can', 'support', 'well-heeled', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'manner', '8217', 'become', 'accustomed', 'sense', 'frustration', 'increases', 'simply', 'being', 'City', 'Light', 'enveloped', 'sense', 'other', 'times', 'particularly', 'Paris', 'twenties', 'such', 'eminent', 'cultural', 'American', 'ex-pats', 'such', 'Gertrude', 'Stein', 'Scott-Fitzgerald', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'moved', 'sense', 'given', 'seeming', 'physical', 'reality', 'when', 'preferring', 'walk', 'home', 'night', 'out', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'particularly', 'boorish', 'ex-lecturer/friend', 'Paul', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Gil', 'twentieth', 'Century', 'equivalent', 'Cinderella', '8217', 's', 'coach', 'off', 'magical', 'world', 'fantasies', 'where', 'befriended', 'cultural', 'ex-pat', 'heroes', 'soiree', 'Stein', '8217', 's', 'apartment', 'Almost', 'needless', 'say', 'serious', 'implications', 'impending', 'nuptials.It', '8217', 's', 'bit', 'too', 'obviously', 'contrived', 'increasingly', 'irritating', 'accordion-based', 'soundtrack', 'increasingly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'postcard', 'depictions', 'Paris', 'audience', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'aware', 'how', 'script', 'manipulate', 'viewer', 'ascribe', 'view', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'parents', 'are', 'philistines', 'need', 'be', 'dumped', 'always', 'affable', 'Wilson', 'conveniently', 'reinforced', 'equally', 'odious', 'Sheen', 'whom', 'Inez', 'bafflingly', 'enamoured.Ultimately', '8217', 's', 'harmless', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'travelogue', 'space-time', 'Wilson', 'best', 'impersonate', 'more', 'youthful', 'Woody', 'Paris', 'green', 'lovely', 'get', 'agree', 'cosily', 'correct', 'decisions', 'Gil', 'trying', 'sort', 'out', 'future.It', '8217', 'not', 'one', 'Woody', '8217', 'best', 'want', 'bit', 'more', 'invention', 'same', 'geographical', 'location', 'try', 'go', 'back', 'Amelie']",N/A

(Gay in the sense of wildly fun and creative, anything goes gay)...Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds, Gertrude Stein, Dali, Bunel and other luminaries come to life and through the strange series of events and meetings with them the Owen Wilson character learns a lesson, and we get it, too, about people and any particular time in history.

I DO NOT CONSIDER THIS TO BE A ""SPOILER"" BUT OTHERS MIGHT.The film opens with a lengthy jazz tune while showing us the splendor, romance, and fantasy of Paris to set the mood. Owen Wilson plays Gil, a role Woody Allen wrote for his alter-ego. He is a Hollywood hack writer wanting nothing more than to be a struggling novelist living in Paris in the 1920's. He is engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams). Like Woody's other main characters, he recognizes when people are pretentious and pseudo-intellectuals such as Inez's friends. This is a running theme in his productions either in front of or behind the camera. Hint: If you couldn't understand why Allen is a genius from his other films, feel free to skip this one.Gil desires to move to Paris. Inez is somewhat Republican and can't imagine living anywhere but the USA. One evening the two couples are out. Three of them want to go dancing while Gil does not. Instead he opts to take a nice leisurely stroll back to the hotel. Unfortunately he didn't drop any bread crumbs and like too many Americans in Paris he doesn't speak French so he can't ask for directions. (If you have ever been to Paris you know all those French can speak English, but won't because they enjoy watching us struggle with their language.)Then at midnight...Allen creates a whole movie around one of his old stand up comedy bits come to be known as ""The Lost Generation"" [...] which goes like this:""I mentioned before that I was in Europe. It's not the first time that I was in Europe, I was in Europe many years ago with Ernest Hemingway. Hemingway had just written his first novel, and Gertrude Stein and I read it, and we said that is was a good novel, but not a great one, and that it needed some work, but it could be a fine book. And we laughed over it. Hemingway punched me in the mouth.""That winter Picasso lived on the Rue d'Barque, and he had just painted a picture of a naked dental hygenist in the middle of the Gobi Desert. Gertrude Stein said it was a good picture, but not a great one, and I said it could be a fine picture. We laughed over it and Hemingway punched me in the mouth.""Francis Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald came home from their wild new years eve party. It was April. Scott had just written Great Expectations, and Gertrude Stein and I read it, and we said it was a good book, but there was no need to have written it, 'cause Charles Dickens had already written it. We laughed over it, and Hemingway punched me in the mouth.""That winter we went to Spain to see Manolete fight, and he was... looked to be eighteen, and Gertrude Stein said no, he was nineteen, but that he only looked eighteen, and I said sometimes a boy of eighteen will look nineteen, whereas other times a nineteen year old can easily look eighteen.

1494945,A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW,B005MYEPXC,The Peripatetic Reader,"[1, 1]","Midnight in ParisIf you have, as I, followed the career of Woody Allen from the early days, and one of his great fans, you will like this movie, because it is a fresh dose of Allen shtick. The elements of this shtick are: upscale, self-absorbed couple, usually a writer (guess who?), swank dinner parties, elevated conversation on art, politics, etc., man in emotional crisis, infatuated with an elusive, unobtainable beauty, and all the while counseled by a father figure. We've seen it all before, from Annie Hall, onwards, which made Allen's films, while flawless movie-making, all a bit dull and predictable.While he uses his same ol' shtick, Midnight in Paris is different. This movie after all is about a love affair, yes, but Paris and the lost generation of American expatriates and other avant garde artists living in Paris in the 20s are subjects. The script is inventive and orginal, and the characterizations of Hemingway, Fitgerald, etc., are dead-on. So while the elements of the Allen shtick are present -- I mean, who talks about art in their daily conversation, anyway? The only time the people I know talk about painting is when it covers the walls -- the movie is fresh, alive, and original, and a joy to behold.

1494947,A3VAXB8CDYY5BG,B005MYEPXC,The Wingchair Critic,"[9, 10]","After an artistic and commercial surge that lasted from 1969's 'Take the Money And Run' through 1987's 'Radio Days,' Woody Allen's creative powers began to noticeably flag in the late 1980s. His comic films seemed repetitive and were no longer very funny, his dramas were murky and superficial, his productions began to look shabby (1993's thread-worn 'Manhattan Murder Mystery' being a good example) and, where Allen once commanded the finest acting talent the industry had to offer, his films began to be populated with second- and third-tier performers.The Mia Farrow/Soon-Yi Previn scandal, which broke in the early 1990s, further alienated the general public, and, with the commercial failure of his projects, Allen began having trouble finding financing for his films.Still, when Allen, who had rarely made a film outside of New York City, decamped to London to make 2005's critically and commercially successful crime drama 'Match Point,' New Yorkers were aghast, since they appeared to be losing their city's greatest ambassador. But Allen went on to celebrate the city of London in the mediocre 'Scoop' (2006) and both the underrated drama 'Cassandra's Dream' and the equally underrated comedic 'You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger' (2007 and 2010, respectively).In between, Allen stopped over in Barcelona to film the internationally acclaimed comedy 'Vicki Cristina Barcelona,' a film which, as 'Match Point' had done for London, did for the Spanish city what Allen had done for New York City decades ago in 1979's 'Manhattan,' still one of the jewels in the crown of his career.How wonderful for Allen, and for movie-lovers everywhere, that Allen, at present in his 70s, has now done the same thing for the French capitol with 2011's 'Midnight in Paris,' which, among things, is the first authentically warm film Allen has ever made.There have been moments of human warmth in earlier Allen films (the poignant conclusion of 'Manhattan,' some of the scenes between Cecilia and Tom Baxter in 1985's 'The Purple Rose of Cairo,' or those between Eliot and Lee, or Mickey and Holly in 1986's 'Hannah & Her Sisters'), but 'human warmth,' as such, has never been very high on the list of subjects Allen has chosen to explore, despite his obvious romanticism.The literally magical 'Midnight in Paris' has a very simple plot, a fact which works in the film's favor throughout: Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), a successful Hollywood screenwriter who would actually prefer to be a successful novelist of literary merit, is visiting Paris with his beautiful but shrewish fianc&eacute;, Inez (Rachel McAdams), and her wealthy, conservative, and materialistic parents. Enchanted by his knowledge of Parisian history and the Parisian streets themselves, Gil makes excuses and breaks away from Inez and her entourage.Unable to find his hotel as midnight approaches, the slightly drunken Gil is picked up by a mysterious vintage automobile of boisterous bon vivants; before long, he finds himself drinking, dancing and conversing with F. Scott and Zleda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll, who steals the film with a dynamic and subtle performance), Gertrude Stein (a not very believable Kathy Bates), Djuna Barnes, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali (a hilarious Adrien Brody), and other literary and artistic legends in the distant Paris of the 1920s, a 'dream period' in which Gil imagines life would have been full of meaning, beauty, purpose, and endless, but realizable,  potential.Finding himself cast adrift in the present again the following morning, Gil attempts to recreate and share his secret with Inez on the next evening, but vulgar and petulant Inez, bored with waiting, leaves before midnight, the magic hour in which the car appears to escort Gil into the past. In his nightly revels in 1920s Paris, Gil eventually falls in love with Picasso's mistress, Adrianna (a gently stunning Marion Cotillard), a woman who is as lovely in spirit as she is in person. Much to his surprise, however, Gil finds that Adrianna cares little for her own era and instead romanticizes turn of the century Paris---the Belle &Eacute;poque.Unable to explain his preoccupied mental state or his midnight wanderings to Inez or her family, Gil, who thinks Paris looks best in the rain, takes again to the daylight Parisian streets, where he encounters young antiques dealer Gabrielle (L&eacute;a Seydoux) and strikes up a promising acquaintanceship, though Adrianna and the 1920s continue to haunt and lure him on.Stunningly photographed by Darius Khondji, 'Midnight in Paris' not only ends warmly and happily, but the film is full of life, dimension, and figurative color to a degree never attempted in an Allen film.Though Inez and her family, as types, have appeared recently in other Allen films, they are in no way the focus of the film: they are present merely to show what Gil has to fully realize and reject before he can move on with his life in a truly satisfactory manner. The script makes some rather lowly and cumbersome digs at the Republican party and the Tea Party movement, but the remarks, which flow from Gil's mouth, feel so tacked on and superfluous that they are easy to overlook.Warm in tone and color, beautiful to look at, wonderfully written and acted (Owen Wilson is by far the best 'Woody Allen stand-in' since John Cusack), and powerfully scored and edited, 'Midnight in Paris' stands alongside 'Love & Death' (1975), 'Annie Hall' (1977), 'Interiors' (1978), 'Manhattan,' 'Stardust Memories' (1980), the underrated 'A Midsummer's Night Sex Comedy' (1982), 'Broadway Danny Rose' (1984), 'The Purple Rose of Cairo,' 'Hannah & Her Sisters,' 'Bullets Over Broadway' (1994), 'Match Point,' and 'Vicki Cristina Barcelona' as one of Allen's most creatively successful, joyous, and visionary films.More than midway through the film, Allen has Gertrude Stein telling Gil that the artist's job is to provide meaning in a meaningless world, something 'Midnight In Paris' itself does in poignant and touching fashion.",5,"Manhattan's Loss, The World's Gain",1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,6029,"['artistic', 'commercial', 'surge', 'lasted', '1969',

It's a pleasant and enchanting story about a modern day writer (Owen Wilson)who magically travels back in time to Paris in the 1920s where he meets famous writers and artists of the the time including Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Picasso, and Gertrude Stein, and maybe where he falls in love.  The cinematography in sumptious and the attention to period detail amazing.  Do you need to know these writers and artists?  Not really.  If you know a little about how Hemingway writes, you'll appreciate how funny a character Woody Allen has created in his Hemingway.  Other than that, most of the historical people are window-dressing (although there's a really funny scene built around a meeting of surrealist artists including Adrian Brody as Salvadore Dali).  Humor is at times subtle and at other times broad.  Much of the broad humor comes from remarks about the writer (Wilson) made by Rachel McAdams as his fiancee, and by her mother -- but for me, the two female characters are so bitchy as to be obnoxious.  I think, for the sake of humor, Woody Allen erred in making the fiancee and her parents such stereotypes.  It is the only false note in an otherwise wonderful and lovely movie.

1494949,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B005MYEPXC,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 8]","***1/2Woody Allen is a cyclical filmmaker - he follows a good film with a string of unforgettable and just plain bad films that he doesn't seem to have his heart in. Given he consistently churns out one or two films a year, this leaves a lot of celluloid for his fans to slog through to get to the gems. I used to be a devoted fan and would happily sit through the more 'trying' films. But a few years ago, the balance shifted. He used to make two or three enjoyable films followed by a mediocre film. Now, he might make a good movie and follow this with three, four, five bad films. When I started consistently sitting through a fifth dud, I gave up. A filmmaker who once was one of my favorites is now relegated to catch-it-on-DVD status.Allen's newest film, ""Midnight in Paris"", starring Owen Wilson (Danger, Will Robinson. DANGER!), Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates, Adrian Brody and Michael Sheen, got a lot of good pre-release buzz, so I decided to give it a try and headed to the theater.Allen has made some interesting casting choices, using a wide range of actors to play the leading man in his films, the role he would normally play, but has moved away from in recent years. Kenneth Branagh, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Javier Bardem, Scarlett Johannson, Larry David, Josh Brolin, to name a few. It is a strange mix and has produced uneven results. Some of these actors have played pale copies of Allen's persona; others have ventured to create something new. So, I wasn't thrilled to learn Owen Wilson was his latest choice. I have enjoyed very few of Wilson's films and it doesn't appear to be a good match. Allen's dialogue, his writing style, is very distinctive and I couldn't imagine Wilson making it work.""Midnight"" opens with a montage of beauty shots of Paris. This sequence is enough to make anyone who has been to the City of Light, anyone who has read about the City of Light, or anyone who has any desire to see the City of Light swoon. These portraits will make your yearning increase ten fold. Allen and his cinematographer Darius Khonji (""Seven"", ""Panic Room"") capture every famous location, every famous street and neighborhood, painting each in sepia tones, giving us a romantic snapshot of each, as though they are taking us on an exclusive, inclusive walking tour.After this introduction, we meet Gil (Wilson) and his fianc&eacute;e, Inez (McAdams) who have joined her parents on a mostly-business trip to Paris. Gil is like a child in a candy shop and can't stop talking about all of the reasons he loves the city. He even tells his future wife he wants to drop his career as a screenwriter, move from Pasadena to Paris, and work on his unfinished novel. A walk in the rain wouldn't be bad either. Inez can't wait to return home and seems annoyed by Gil's dreams. Then, they run into Paul (Michael Sheen) and his wife, Carol (Nina Aranda). The old friends invite the second couple to join them for some sightseeing. Inez is fascinated by know-it-all Paul and is grateful to tag along. But Gil is bored and breaks away, he simply wants to walk the streets and soak up the culture, the ambiance. He quickly gets lost and at the stroke of midnight, an old limo drives up and the man in the back beckons Gil to join them. Gil climbs in and meets F. Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston, Loki in ""Thor"") and his wife, Zelda (Allison Pill). They attend a party and Gil soon meets Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll, TV's ""Law & Order: LA""), Salvador Dali (Adrian Brody), Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) and Picasso's newest muse, Adrianna (Marion Cotillard). Naturally, Gil loves this world and the daylight hours in the present become more trying.""Midnight in Paris"" is far from the greatness of ""Annie Hall"", ""Manhattan"", ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" or ""Hannah and Her Sisters"", but it has some moments. Allen's love of Paris and the era Gil escapes to is both obvious and infectious. When Gil talks about his love of the city, his desire to walk in the rain, to tour museums, to sit at sidewalk cafes, this is Allen talking, using this character to tell us his feelings. And Wilson does a good job of portraying Gil's love. When he first enters this other world with the Fitzgeralds, he does so in a way we can believe. He doesn't rub his eyes in an exaggerated way; he remains silent taking everything in. When he finally realizes this is no joke, he just goes with it. Would Hemingway agree to look at his book? No, but Hemingway wants Getrude Stein to read it. She agrees. Gil can hardly believe his luck. The next night, he is prepared, holding a copy of his unfinished manuscript when the clock strikes twelve.With each new introduction, he becomes more and more comfortable and wanders into a restaurant where he meets Man Ray, Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali. And as he becomes more comfortable with these people, Gil begins to utter little asides to each of the famous people, giving them hints to a future work they will create. These are funny moments, especially when the famous writer or painter doesn't get it, doesn't believe what Gil is saying.As Gil spends more time in this world, he gets to know Adrianna better and their relationship blossoms in a sweet way, taking some nice turns along the way.Wilson actually does a pretty good job in this film. It is a quiet, understated performance for him and a nice change of pace. Not only does Wilson seem to be handling the material well, Allen's writing seems looser, allowing the actor to get a handle on the director's writing. There are fewer references to psychotherapy, neuroses and other Allen mainstays than in previous films. Gil is simply fascinated by the city and the people he meets there.Allen never has trouble casting his films because actors clamor to work with him. He has a huge reputation and has helped many actors achieve some of their best critical notices; Leonardo DiCaprio, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Hugh Jackman, Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, Michael Caine, Josh Brolin and many more have all appeared in his films. And he frequently has the good fortune to cast up and coming actors, usually after they have made a critically acclaimed film or just before they hit it big. These 'unknowns' have included Scarlet Johannson, Freida Pinto, Radha Mitchell, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and others. In ""Paris"", Corey Stoll plays Ernest Hemingway and he is the best of the actors playing the plethora of writers, painters and artists. Currently on ""Law & Order: Los Angeles"", Stoll manages to capture the bravado and machismo of the famous writer in a way that also seems completely natural and right for the character. Every time Hemingway speaks, you can imagine him filing the statement away, to be used later in a potential short story or novel. It is a funny, spot-on performance.The problem with so many actors clamoring to appear in Allen's films is that many of these actors take on small roles, sometimes very small roles, and because they are top billed, their performance seems disappointing. In ""Paris"", Adrian Brody plays Salvador Dali, the famous Spanish surrealist. He has one scene with Wilson's Gil, which is funny, but it doesn't add or contribute to the story enough to make it worth the time. Ultimately, having Brody around for only five minutes is more disappointing than the laughter his brief role creates.Tom Hiddleston, Allison Pill and Kathy Bates are all good and they have a little more time to make their characters come alive.During the present day moments, Gil spends a lot of time with Inez, as he feels he should, but he is just biding his time until he hears the clock chime midnight and he can return to Paris in the 20s. It is easy to see why  - Inez is a pretty unlikable person and you have to wonder what Gil saw in her in the first place. Rachel McAdams does what she can with the role, but she is never sympathetic or even slightly likable. Allen seems to feel she needs to be completely unsympathetic to make Gil's burgeoning romance with Adriana acceptable. Why this is, I don't know. In previous films, we always felt a little something for the wife or girlfriend, felt some sympathy for them when their husbands or boyfriends started cheating on them. But Inez seems to have nothing in common with Gil, she doesn't support or share his dreams, she seems only interested in the material life, the good life, she seems to be from a whole different place altogether. Because she is such a polar opposite, she sticks out like a sore thumb and the role seems forced and unnatural.Allen does work in a few funny jabs at current politics because Inez's parents seem to be staunchly Conservative. These lines are funny, but will also make the film seem less universal as time passes.Michael Sheen is very funny as Paul, the know-it-all who everyone seems enthralled with. Everyone except Gil. He clearly can't stand Inez's old friend, yet Paul and Inez both seem oblivious to this. At one point, Paul gets into an argument with a tour guide as they stroll through a sculpture garden. Later, because Gil know has some first hand knowledge, he feels confident to debate Paul, leading to some laughs. Naturally, Inez shushes her fianc&eacute;e because she only wants to listen to Paul. But even he seems to disappear after the first half of the film, as Gil becomes more and more captivated by the romance of Paris in the 20s.This is the biggest fault with the film. Allen seems to have great fun introducing all of these characters and elements, but he has difficulty keeping them all going and simply abandons many to concentrate on certain aspects of the story. Maybe the director who could keep many character storylines going throughout the course of the film is gone. Maybe the director of ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" is gone. I hope not.Later, Inez and Gil have a fight. This scene has all of the elements of a great Allen moment- we watch the couple walk back and forth into the room as they argue, it seems like they might really get to the heart of the matter between them.

Apparently some people thought so.  Like some others I am not a Woody Allen fan but I did enjoy the movie.  I thought it was a light, fluffy trifle.  Out of the gate the main set-up of Gil's (a demure Owen Wilson) romantic notions of writing a great novel being met by his fiancee's (the ever-lovely Rachel McAdams, here playing the fascist ""I-know-what's-best-for-you"" girlfriend tripe) dismissiveness feels utterly familiar; this mismatch was written as about as loudly on the walls so to speak as a neon Nordstrom's sign blares against the dark nighttime.  So what made this movie click then?  I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it yet but I'll just say that there is a little magic afoot which brings Gil's romantic writer into contact with various literary and artistic historical figures such as Ernest Hemingway and Salvador Dali; the offbeat spirit and portrayal of these characters is a minor delight, perhaps moreso to those viewers who are much more intimately acquainted with them.  The filmography of Paris is gorgeous (and sanitized), a loving ode to the city of light.  And no characters are drawn out to be utterly repulsive (though some of their behavior would be in reality, all is neatly forgiven or waxed over in almost sitcom fashion) so no real sour taste is left in your mouth (or memory).  Like I said, the movie is a light, fluffy trifle.  It's popcorn fare (Kettle corn?) for the arthouse and Woody Allen set I suppose.  Nothing wrong with that.  But a best pic nom?

It certainly is, but the film is also a well-made bitter-sweet romantic comedy. What is most remarkable about it is the optimistic and relaxed feel of the entire film.

While staying in Paris with his fianc&eacute;e, Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents, Gil, who is writing a novel about a ""nostalgia shop,"" is given a chance to travel in time back to the 1920s, and meet the artists including Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll) and Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), as well as Picasso's lover, beautiful and charming Adriana (Marion Cotillard).What Gil eventually learns about his own vision of the glorified past is nothing new, though it makes an interesting contrast to the nostalgic tone seen here, and in the director's works in the past (""Radio Days"" for instance).

1494957,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B005MYEPXC,Turfseer,"[6, 12]","**This review may contain spoilers""There's an old Twilight Zone episode, a fantasy-drama called 'The Trouble with Templeton' which came out during the iconic show's second season.  It's a similar concept to 'Midnight in Paris'.  Templeton is a fading stage director who believes that his glory days were back in the 20s and gets the opportunity go back there and learn an important lesson.  Unlike the Twilight Zone episode, Woody Allen's story is more of a romantic comedy.  It features Owen Wilson as a hack Hollywood screenwriter who aspires for more as a high brow novelist.  Wilson is the protagonist, Gil,  who's vacationing in Paris with his fiancee and her parents.  Wilson delivers many of Woody Allen's expressions in the same way as 'The Master' and that's probably why Woody praises him vociferously during the news conference extra in the DVD bonus section.As in many other Woody Allen films, the protagonist is friendly with another couple, with the male partner depicted as a pretentious intellectual.  Woody also gets his ubiquitous digs in at right wingers, making jokes at the Tea Party's expense, through the mouth of the father-in-law to be, a corporate executive who decidedly is in the Republican camp.  As usual, Woody's protagonist must move on from a failed relationship with a woman at the end; in this case, it's the fiance, Inez, perkily played by Rachel McAdams.The central conceit of 'Midnight in Paris' is Gil's time traveling back to the 1920s in Paris.  Woody doesn't come up with a very clever mode of transport: a limousine from the 20s appears out of the blue at midnight on a Parisian street and whisks our protagonist back to those heady days where he runs into the likes of Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.During the news conference on the DVD, Woody makes it clear that his intent is to satirize the artistes who Gil runs into.  At first, it's rather neat to watch a perennially intoxicated Zelda Fitzgerald do her thing as well as listen to Cole Porter at at the piano, but soon we realize that Woody has little to say about these iconic figures.  Hemingway isn't very amusing blathering about all his macho concerns and Picasso shows up merely as a buffoon, seducing one woman after another.  Adrien Brody tries his best to suck out humor from a pretentious Salvador Dali but ultimately is unable to come up with anything funny.  There's a brief, slightly humorous bit where Gil suggests to the surrealist film director, Bunuel, the concept for his classic picture, ""The Exterminating Angel"", with the exasperated director rejecting it since he tells Gil that it doesn't make any sense.  Kathy Bates has little to do as Gertrude Stein, except offering her critique of Gil's new manuscript.A good part of 'Midnight' has to do with Gil's infatuation with Adriana, one of Picasso's cast-offs.  When Gil finds Adriana's autobiography at a bookseller in the present, he learns that he gave her a pair of earrings back in the 20s. This leads to an awkward scene where he attempts to steal Inez's earrings in order to fulfill the prophetic passage in Adriana's book. Gil is interrupted by Inez and her parents, who have returned to the hotel room after the father has some kind of heart scare.  Gil's machinations, attempting to prevent Inez from discovering that he stole the earrings, don't cut it since he could have avoided the whole predicament by buying earrings for Adriana at a store the next day (and that's what predictably transpires!).Gil finally learns an important life lesson that living in the past is useless when he joins Adriana in traveling back to her golden age of the 1890s.  Back in the 20s, Hemingway speculates that Inez has been cheating on Gil, who confronts her when he returns to the present time.'Midnight in Paris' is watchable but I guarantee you'll forget about this film after a few days.

Any kind of basic art history course and one in American literature would be plenty.  In fact, just knowing these artists and writers existed would probably be enough. It helps also if one can recognize obnoxious in-laws-to-be and not be offended by an accurate portrayal of them. A sense of humor helps as does an ability to sit back and enjoy oneself.

Great movie. I watched it twice within a matter of days. Loved it!The old saying, ""The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence"" applies to this movie. We all tend to have nostalgic feelings, probably misplaced and skewed, of a time in the past; either our own past or further back, when things were better. The main character gets the chance to find out for himself...I'd recommend getting this in Blue Ray - a few of the night scenes; including smokey bars, are a bit hazy plus I'd just like to see the beauty of Paris in the highest clarity possible.Also, keep a cultural dictionary or encyclopedia (or have Wikipedia ready on your laptop): You are going to hear a lot of artists (painters, singers, writers, movie producers, musicians, etc.) mentioned that unless you are an Art Major, will leave you wondering, ""Where have I heard that name before?""",5,The Golden Years - were they really Golden?,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,995,"[""'ll"", 'keep', 'short', 'sweet', 'love', 'time-travel', 'movies', 'wife', 'chick-flicks', 'movie', 'abundance', 'Great', 'movie', 'watched', 'twice', 'matter', 'days', 'Loved', 'old', 'saying', 'grass', 'always', 'greener', 'other', 'side', 'fence', 'applies', 'movie', 'tend', 'have', 'nostalgic', 'feelings', 'probably', 'misplaced', 'skewed', 'time', 'past', 'own', 'past', 'further', 'back', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'better', 'main', 'character', 'chance', 'find', 'out', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'getting', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'few', 'night', 'scenes', 'including', 'smokey', 'bars', 'are', 'bit', 'hazy', ""'d"", 'just', 'like', 'see', 'beauty', 'Paris', 'highest', 'clarity', 'possible.Also', 'keep', 'cultural', 'dictionary', 'encyclopedia', 'have', 'Wikipedia', 'ready', 'laptop', 'are', 'going', 'hear', 'lot', 'artists', 'painters', 'singers', 'writers', 'movie', 'producers', 'musicians', 'etc', 'mentioned', 'are', 'Art', 'Major', 'will', 'leave', 'wondering', 'Where', 'have', 'heard', 'name']",N/A
