There are some good one-liners in the film, with a script that is so peppered with the 'f' word that it is crippled by it, but the story has been done before and much better and this time around the 'twist' is obvious from the film's opening lines.Goofus-doofus Midwesterner Jaime (Brendan Fraser) has moved form Ohio to New York with his gorgeous girlfriend Belisa (Amber Valletta) to join a sales company whose chief salesman is foul mouthed, ill tempered Ted (Michael Keaton) who appears to loathe everyone and the world. Jaime is assigned to Ted, but Jaime's level of intelligence borders on idiocy and his fate with the company seems doomed...until Jaime introduces Belisa to Ted...and the  romantic fireworks start.  Ted falls for Belisa and begins to change his outlook, confiding his inner spirit as a professor of English literature to Belisa.  A transformation takes place and as Jaime spirals downward while Ted and Belisa's affair ignites, role reversal happens as a not at all surprising plot unfolds.Michael Keaton is a fine actor and makes the best of this mouthy role, but Brendan Fraser's talents are completely wasted - a hint from the start that all is not as it appears...  It is a mediocre movie and even if the audience doesn't turn off the soundtrack to rid the script of the trashy language, it can become insulting to the intellect.  But again, Keaton helps it float.

This was one of the most riveting movies I have seen in a VERY long time. The performances were beyond good and I have so many good things to say about it that I hate to dampen it with negativity...with that being said however...Mr. Keaton's performance was marred by the fact that the only words he knows are the tiny little ones he uses to link every curse word known to man. It was over the top and not in a good way! Ok...so maybe I live a sheltered life working for IBM among other businesses, but after the initial shock value wore off I had to wonder if the people who wrote the script was really frustrated in his own life because no one in the business world really talks that way do they? Or allow themselves to be talked to that way either...especially buy a salesman?But as stated earlier...the movie was amazing. It keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. And you just let it all sink in and then you watch it again. And again...looking for signs of what was going to happen.

1071604,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000PISZ7W,Lee Armstrong,"[1, 2]","""The Last Time"" kept my interest.  The sales lingo and stiff competition formed a good foundation for the film where getting ahead vies with truthfulness.  Michael Keaton who was in ""First Daughter"" and played Batman for Tim Burton years ago does a good job as the cutthroat Ted who does anything to make the sale.  Keaton develops the character well as we eventually see his vulnerability.  Brendan Fraser who was inThe Air I Breathewhich was not so great and the Oscar-winningCrash (Widescreen Edition)plays Jamie, a naive salesman from Ohio trying to adjust to New York.  One of the deleted scenes showing Fraser in leather with a girl in the bathroom was thankfully not in the final cut.  Fraser does a good job showing the downhill emotional trajectory of the character.  Amber Valetta fromTransporter 2plays Jamie's girlfriend Belisa.  The scene with her being unfaithful with Ted as Jamie lies unconscious next to them in the bed is jarring.  Billy Slaughter turns in a nice cameo performance as the frisky intern who gets beat up in the parking lot.  Neal McDonough turns his blue eyes loose as Hurly whose bravado exceeds his accomplishment.  Michael Lerner was a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee for ""Barton Fink"" in 1991.  He turns in a nice cameo performance as the sales guru Leguzza who has a penchant for Korean boys.  Michael Caleo who directed an episode of ""The Sopranos"" helms the project and keeps it unpredictable into the home stretch.  Perhaps we might call this ""Death of Salesman 2.""

The disk is too small to make a good frisbee and the story (which is supposed to be a psychological thriller) is neither psychological nor is it a thriller.Here is the story so you don't have to waste your time watching it.  Keaton plays a salesman who is set up to mentor a new man from the midwest.  The new man is engaged, so naturally Keaton's character, who is a really nasty fellow, starts having sex with his fiancee.  What he does not know is, the fiancee is a prostitute hired by a man who wants to take over the company.  Somehow Keaton's affair brings down the entire sales office and helps bring down the value of the company (since other prostitutes have been hired to sabotage other sales offices across the country.)  This creates an opportunity for the fellow who engineered the whole thing to buy the company for a cut rate price.  Keaton's character loses his job, finds out he's been played for a sap by a hooker, and then goes back to his old job at Northwestern University as a college prof.  The story ends with the people who set all this up laughing at him.  That is supposed to be a thrilling surprise ending, except that it makes no sense.
