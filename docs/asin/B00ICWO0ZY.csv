Most of the footage is re-used but re-arranged to focus on Jesus&#8217; ministry, persecution, death, and resurrection.The movie is 138 minutes and there are lots of extras with commentary from Joel Osteen, Rick Warren, Charles Jenkins, and Touched by an Angel&#8217;s Dr. Della Reese-Lett.  There&#8217;s footage from behind the scenes and a promotion for Compassion International.Son of God is rated PG-13 for violence due to the beatings and cruel death our savior endured for our salvation.

The best movie about Jesus ever made if you make it like a superhero action-adventure special effect packed blockbuster! Amen :)I'm sorry guys for whoever loved this film. This is a sorry excuse for a Christian film. I would doubt whoever wrote it was a Christian. THe biblical accuracy was maybe around 75-80% if that. The story was there but maybe in wrong chronological order and most of the little details were wrong including very simple famous passages and verses from the bible that even children would get right. I understand you can take certain literary liberties but when dealing with historical and biblical text you don't want to stray from the actual truth for any sort of dramatic or personal literary effect.  Okay they need to make a whole movie the way they did the first 5 minutes. It was a bad tease to make the most awesome 5 minutes I've ever seen about any sort of Christian movie then all of a sudden be like now it's about Jesus who is lame, dumb, and boring. Jesus was/is a powerful, most fascinating, almost mystical and magical divine supernatural being. they need to make it like mortal kombat, harry potter, any of the marvel avenger movies. With all that special effects. Why is it when they make a movie about Jesus it's always slow, boring, puts the viewers to sleep and not accurate? Are they seriously making this movie to the best of their ability?Who did they make this movie for? Christians? I'm a Christian and sort of offended at how bad this film was. For non believers? They would turn it off within 10 minutes or less... It's almost like they are trying to turn people away from christianity rather than showing people the awesome wonder of HIs majesty the King! This is beyond disappointing. I was looking forward to this because others had told me they enjoyed it. I had so much trouble just sitting here watching it. I was bored out of my mind. I don't recommend this movie unless you can watch for free and even then prepare to fall asleep, better yet if you are having trouble falling asleep pop this in your dvd or bluray player and you'll be out like a light.NOw it's not all bad. The story is always positive. The message of Jesus is always strong. Obviously parts touched my heart because I hold a soft spot in my heart for Jesus so yes there are parts we can connect to but for the most part anyone could make a better movie in their garage!

Given the age of understanding we are in, to use the Greek rendering of &#34;Jesus&#34; vs. His Hebrew name was a little disappointing. Also, in the beginning the wise men showing up at the stable? Correct interpretation of the scriptures shows that they showed up later at the house where Joseph and Miriam were staying and most scholars have accepted this as correct. So why didn't the movie depict it accurately??? If to appeal to new Christians, it is doing a disservice to the Truth -and- to Christianity as a whole.The event of the woman accused of adultery, leaving out the part about writing in the earth, was to leave out the WORD of YHWH who had something to say about that in the Book of Jeremiah.Also all throughout the movie, no mention of many of His miracles and that many were done on the Sabbath. Again, not true to the WORD.And the most important omission was in the Garden when He asked the soldiers: &#34;Whom do you seek?&#34; They answer &#34;Jesus of Nazareth&#34; and He says &#34; I AM He&#34; and the soldiers fell backward because of the Power in the saying of the Name. Except He wasn't asked in the movie and so didn't answer. This being a crucial understanding of the tying together of the Great I AM of the OT to the I AM of the NT.The depiction of the Last Supper (The Jew's Passover) and the next day's true Passover. There is historical evidence that two calendars were being kept back then and the acceptance of that then clears up the mysterious last supper, what it really was and why EHYEHshua was able to then, go out to the Garden that night when clearly Torah commands against leaving one's home on Passover evening. To mesh the two events together as being one only serves to confuse the Truth and confuse those seeking the truth.I don't recommend it to serious students of Scripture because of this and even more so to new Christians because it has inaccuracies and omissions.Many movies are made from books and many movies fail to depict those books faithfully.

1693975,A3UT8282ZPMDIT,B00ICWO0ZY,Dan Hawks,"[1, 2]","I found this movie to be a much lower version than the movie &#34;Jesus of Nazareth&#34; back in the 60's. The reason I say this is that it is not biblically correct. Some of the scenes, (e.g. When they are having the last supper. In those days in Israel they did not sit at a table with high legs.) They would lay or half sit on cushions on the floor with a table only a few inches off the ground.They did not have chairs or tables like later on.. The other thing is that when Christ raises Lazarus from the dead, He does not go inside the tomb at all. He also knew four days before that Lazarus was dead. He let Lazarus lay in his tomb 4 days. He did feel sorrow as a human. But after he reached the place where Lazarus was buried. Martha, Lazarus' sister said, &#34;If you had been here Lord , he wouldn't have died.&#34; That is when Jesus  said , &#34;I AM the resurrection and the life&#34;.He then stood by the tomb and prayed for a while. Then stood in front of the tomb and yelled in a loud voice, &#34;Lazarus, come forth&#34; ...Lazarus came out of the tomb.Also, I don't know why people pick actors who are handsome , Hollywood types to play Jesus. Jesus was a Jew in Israel.Israel is very hot in the summer.  He was dark and with Jewish features and as Paul says later in his Epistles, &#34;for we all know it is shameful for a man to wear long hair. For a woman it is her glory.&#34;  In those days it was not acceptable for a man to wear long hair in their culture. There are a lot of misguiding things I have seen in the movies concerning Jesus. The movie &#34;Passion of the Christ &#34; was better but still out of context with the descriptions of the Bible. If they had whipped Jesus as shown in that movie, He would have died when they whipped Him tearing off his rib cage.

He can even be a great teacher.But it's the last part of the verse (that is usually skipped) that becomes a great offense - &#34;... no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&#34;It's tolerable that Jesus went around teaching people to love one another, but the instant He becomes the Son of God sent to earth as the ONLY means to save humanity which was otherwise undone and hopelessly lost it becomes offensive. Why do I need a redeemer? I'm a pretty good person!Remove the true message of the gospel and viewers are left wondering why He went to the cross. Why did He even need to come in the first place?The account of Jesus is the most powerful, compelling, beautiful and loving message of all humanity.  It stands strong left untampered. Hollywood's modification of it waters it down and removes the true meaning and purpose which in essence is an attempt to undermine God.I urge you to read your bibles and let God's spirit speak to you so you can know the truth.  Jesus dying on the cross wasn't a blanket forgiveness for everyone or some vain sacrifice or mistake.The standard for being with a holy, righteous God is perfect righteousness which none of us have because we have all gone astray and are sperated from God by our sin.  So unless you are perfect, you must have a perfect,sinless sacrifice to take your place for the judgement. Jesus lived the perfect life we can't live, took the sins of everyone upon Him, paid the debt we can't pay, defeated the death we can't defeat and through His substitutionary death He provides atonement and the only way to get to the Father in heaven.All we have to do is repent, renounce our claims to personal righteousness, commit our lives and believe in what Jesus did for us on the cross:  Receive Him as your Lord and Savior. Believing God exists isn't enough. The devils believe in God.  You must also belong to God and that's the part where our selfish nature often keeps us seperated from Him.Hmmm....Funny how none of that comes through in the film...Read your bibles so you can know the truth and the truth will set you free.",2,What a shame...

1694003,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00ICWO0ZY,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","It's difficult to write about a movie that focuses on the life of Christ without bringing your own personal beliefs into it. How can you claim to be offering an unbiased review if you believe in Christ to begin with? I do and always have, but I intend to try and hold my personal beliefs in check while writing about SON OF GOD, new on DVD.If you haven't heard about this film then you've not been paying attention. In 2013 producer Jeff Burnett and his wife Roma Downey put together a TV series that no one expected anyone to watch. What happened surprised the doubters when THE BIBLE went on to become one of the most watched min-series of that year. With that triumph the pair decided to focus on the life of Jesus and made this film which was released to theaters. Once more some were surprised when the film did well financially.The film opens with Jesus birth but then moves fast forward to his gathering the apostles starting with Peter. As he moves forward the film doesn't stay too long on any given moment but puts together bits and pieces from Jesus life in the order they happened. Given the subject matter and amount of time allotted for a feature film there is no way that the entire story of Jesus could include everything from start to finish. What the makers of this film have done is touch on many of the momentous items and miracles that happened in that time.While the first hour of the film touches on his earlier life, teachings and miracles, the second hour begins by setting up his crucifixion. The political ploys between the Romans and the heads of the Jewish religion at the time to insure stability of their personal power is covered here showing that they had no belief in Jesus' teachings and feared him more than anything. He was a disruption to the same old same old, putting their control in jeopardy. As this second hour begins we see them maneuvering him into an arrest which culminates in his conviction and then crucifixion. While painful to watch there is no way it compares to what we saw in Mel Gibson's film THE PASSION. In truth, we don't need to.What separates this movie apart from so many others is the final 18 minutes of the movie. Where THE PASSION showed the death of Christ, SON OF GOD shows his resurrection and appearance before the apostles after rising from the tomb. This was a complaint many religious leaders had with Gibson's film so they should be satisfied with the presentation of it here.All of that being said, a short description of what the movie is about, the question becomes is it worth watching? Was it entertaining? To answer honestly I'd have to say for the most part no. It moves along at a slow pace and uses dramatic music in the background too much. Things that happened in Jesus' life seem to be pushed out and then moved aside to get to the next thing and yet the pace drags. The acting is solid for all involved but no one stands out here. The story for most of us is well known and with the exception of the resurrection offers little that we haven't seen before.That being said, there is a reason to watch the movie. While it may not be a whiz bang movie that holds you by the throat, it does offer an introductory presentation of the life of Christ. If you have children that can't seem to focus on reading the Bible, or if you have problems sticking with it, this movie might offer some insight as to what you'll find there. For some it will give them a glimpse into what Christianity is all about. If nothing else, it could be a good conversation starter that will make people either defend their convictions or defend why they don't have them.I'm glad I watched the film. I'm glad that it was made and that it was successful. I would guess that a number of people will add it to their collections so that they can watch and remember what they should already know if they believe. Perhaps it will cause a few people to reconsider what they should be doing with their Sunday mornings, perhaps not. In the end the determining factor of whether to watch this movie or not, and if you will enjoy it or not, depends mostly on your own personal beliefs. For me it was a nice reminder of what I hear every week at church.",4,THE STORY OF CHRIST,1405382400,"07 15, 2014",2014,4197,"['difficult', 'write', 'movie', 'life', 'Christ', 'bringing', 'own', 'personal', 'beliefs', 'How', 'can', 'claim', 'be', 'offering', 'unbiased', 'review', 'believe', 'Christ', 'begin', 'do', 'always', 'have', 'intend', 'try', 'hold', 'personal', 'beliefs', 'check', 'writing', 'SON', 'OF', 'GOD', 'new', 'DVD.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'film', 'then', ""'ve"", 'not', 'been', 'paying', 'attention', '2013', 'producer', 'Jeff', 'Burnett', 'wife', 'Roma', 'Downey', 'put', 'together', 'TV', 'series', 'one', 'expected', 'anyone', 'watch', 'What', 'happened', 'surprised', 'doubters', 'when', 'THE', 'BIBLE', 'went', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'watched', 'min-series', 'year', 'pair', 'decided', 'focus', 'life', 'Jesus', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'Once', 'more', 'were', 'surprised', 'when', 'film', 'did', 'well', 'financially.The', 'film', 'opens', 'Jesus', 'birth', 'then', 'fast', 'forward', 'gathering', 'apostles', 'starting', 'Peter', 'forward', 'film', ""n't"", 'stay', 'too', 'long', 'given', 'moment', 'together', 'bits', 'pieces', 'Jesus', 'life', 'order', 'happened', 'Given', 'subject', 'matter', 'amount', 'time', 'allotted', 'feature', 'film', 'way', 'entire', 'story', 'Jesus', 'could', 'include', 'everything', 'start', 'finish', 'What', 'makers', 'film', 'have', 'done', 'touch', 'many', 'momentous', 'items', 'miracles', 'happened', 'time.While', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'touches', 'earlier', 'life', 'teachings', 'miracles', 'second', 'hour', 'begins', 'setting', 'up', 'crucifixion', 'political', 'ploys', 'Romans', 'heads', 'Jewish', 'religion', 'time', 'insure', 'stability', 'personal', 'power', 'covered', 'here', 'showing', 'had', 'belief', 'Jesus', 'teachings', 'feared', 'more', 'anything', 'was', 'disruption', 'same', 'old', 'same', 'old', 'putting', 'control', 'jeopardy', 'second', 'hour', 'see', 'maneuvering', 'arrest', 'conviction', 'then', 'crucifixion', 'painful', 'watch', 'way', 'what', 'saw', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'film', 'PASSION', 'truth', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'to.What', 'movie', 'apart', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'final', '18', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Where', 'PASSION', 'showed', 'death', 'Christ', 'SON', 'OF', 'GOD', 'resurrection', 'appearance', 'apostles', 'rising', 'tomb', 'was', 'complaint', 'many', 'religious', 'leaders', 'had', 'Gibson', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'satisfied', 'presentation', 'here.All', 'being', 'said', 'short', 'description', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'question', 'watching', 'entertaining', 'answer', 'honestly', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'most', 'part', 'along', 'slow', 'pace', 'dramatic', 'music', 'background', 'too', 'much', 'Things', 'happened', 'Jesus', 'life', 'seem', 'be', 'pushed', 'out', 'then', 'moved', 'aside', 'get', 'next', 'thing', 'yet', 'pace', 'drags', 'acting', 'solid', 'involved', 'one', 'out', 'here', 'story', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'exception', 'resurrection', 'little', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'being', 'said', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'whiz', 'bang', 'movie', 'throat', 'offer', 'introductory', 'presentation', 'life', 'Christ', 'have', 'children', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'focus', 'reading', 'Bible', 'have', 'problems', 'sticking', 'movie', 'might', 'offer', 'insight', 'what', ""'ll"", 'find', 'there', 'will', 'give', 'glimpse', 'what', 'Christianity', 'about', 'nothing', 'else', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'conversation', 'starter', 'will', 'make', 'people', 'defend', 'convictions', 'defend', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'them.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'watched', 'film', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'successful', 'would', 'guess', 'number', 'people', 'will', 'add', 'collections', 'can', 'watch', 'remember', 'what', 'should', 'already', 'know', 'believe', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'cause', 'few', 'people', 'reconsider', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'Sunday', 'mornings', 'perhaps', 'not', 'end', 'determining', 'factor', 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'will', 'enjoy', 'not', 'mostly', 'own', 'personal', 'beliefs', 'was', 'nice', 'reminder', 'what', 'hear', 'week', 'church']",N/A

1694020,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00ICWO0ZY,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[0, 0]",For people who have never read the biblical accounts of Jesus they will find no fault with this movie. If however you have read the Bible you may wonder about a few things.I would not say this was a totally accurate portrayal of the life of Christ but it did affect me more emotionally than other Jesus movies I've seen. I felt that Diogo Morgado was probably the best looking Jesus I've ever seen. He also played his part especially well during the crucifixion. How many actors could play that part as well? I doubt many. He also portrays Christ as very compassionate and loving.Yes there was a lot of violence in this movie but it was not as bad as I expected. There were also some very profound moments when Jesus speaks the truth. Although some liberties seem to have been taken with the dialogue at times. Overall it stayed true to Jesus' message. I'd have preferred to have listened to Jesus' words as recorded in the King James Version but I guess it is too much to expect in our modern age.There are also a lot of things missing from this movie that would have made it more complete. Like besides Jesus' birth there is nothing about his childhood. While the movie focuses very much on the deep relationship between Jesus and his mother Mary there seems little about Joseph. Even a small scene with Joseph teaching Jesus about carpentry would have been better than nothing. And how about a few scenes of Jesus being lost as a child and being found in the temple? Those things are missing from the life story. But the most important parts of the story are not missing so that is some consolation.What I did especially like about the movie was the portrayal of the miracles although no one blind was healed. And when Lazarus is raised from the dead Jesus goes into the tomb which is not what really happened. I believe Jesus called Lazarus forth from the tomb. But it makes it way more dramatic when Jesus kisses Lazarus' head and he opens his eyes suddenly. I can see why they made things the way they did but I felt sad at the lack of accuracy at times.I guess from reading other reviews I get why they left out the temptation of Christ as well. So overall I liked this movie but did not love it. So I give it four stars because I think this movie makes the story of Christ more accessible to the general public. I would however recommend a reading of the New Testament accounts along with viewing this movie. Also there seems very little indication why Jesus is dying in the first place. Viewers who are not Christians already may miss the whole point because it is not explained well. So for the record Jesus died for the sins of the world. If you believe in Jesus you will be given eternal life.

The snarkiness that is often a given when writing movie reviews may not be listed as a sin via the Ten Commandments, but sometimes it's just not...nice.  And Christians are nice people, for the most part.  This film, which was generally panned by critics and loved by audiences, suffers from the same duality.  SON OF GOD rated a dismal 23% likability by film critics on Rotten Tomatoes, while at the same time pulling down a sky high 82% likability by audiences, which just proves my point.  Movie reviewers hated it, audiences (I'm going out on a limb here and saying that most SON OF GOD audience members are Christians) loved it.  So as a Christian and a critic, where do I stand?  Pretty much in the middle.  I found SON OF GOD better than most of the critics believed, but not up to the near adoration of the public. A solid 3 and a half stars.Am I setting this movie up then, for a snarky review?  Sort of, but not completely.  There are some very good things happening in SON OF GOD, but to find them you must sit through some silliness and more than a few liberties taken by filmmakers eager to pander to the public's thirst for a story told simply with beginning, middle, end, some blood and gore and very clearly defined good and bad guys.  The story of Jesus Christ is much, much more than this, but to tell it in the two hours that today's movies seldom surpass is impossible.  You've gotta cut corners, but SON OF GOD cuts more than a few.  Way more.The film opens with a quick (and I mean QUICK) montage of the Old Testaments greatest hits;  Adam and Eve, Noah, Moses, Goliath and Abraham. That this film was cut from the much longer mini-series becomes fairly obvious here.  Next comes the similarly condensed version of the birth of Christ, after which the fully grown Jesus appears (the swoon inducing Diogo Morgado), ready to begin the true work of man's salvation, beginning with his plea to Peter the fisherman to become ""fishers of men"".  From here on in the road to Calvary is fast and furious, and it is here that my biggest issue with SON OF GOD occurs.  Many of the works of Christ, as well as the teachings of Christ, are glossed over, or ignored completely.  If you know the story of Christ, the teaching, the miracles, the parables, then this isn't too terrible.  We understand that the Lords Prayer is longer than one or two  sentences, that the beatitudes contain more than ""The meek shall inherit the Earth"".  But gone are so many of the works of Christ, his miracles, that if you are not well aware of the biblical stories in the New Testament, then you may very well wonder what all of the fuss was about.So many of these glaring oversights are addressed with one or two sentences that it's a bit giggle inducing.  ""Do not doubt, Thomas"" and ""Where is Judas...have you seen him?"" are just a few of the examples of storylines brought down to their least common denominator with one sentence, implied but not addressed.  John the Baptist rates no more than a few seconds shown in a flashback, and the temptation of Christ by Satan is ignored completely (although the outcry over the resemblance between THE BIBLE's Satan and President Barak Obama may have something to do with this omission).  The period prior to the Palm Sunday entrance of Jesus on the back of a donkey is the weakest of SON OF GOD, but thankfully following this the film begins to finally gain steam.The days leading to the Crucifixion are the backbone of SON OF GOD, and the best and most emotional moments fall within this section.  After Jesus enters Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, the film slows down it's breakneck narration to actually illustrate the events that led to the death of Christ. It's always interesting to see who gets the brunt of the blame for the Crucifixion of Christ in these bliblical films...will it be Pontius Pilate? The Jewish Temple leaders? Judas? The Roman Guardsman?  Every movie seems to point fingers at one group more than others, and in SON OF GOD the winner is Pilate, wonderfully played by Greg Hicks, who is portrayed as more psychopath than ruler.While SON OF GOD doesn't even begin to touch the savagery of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, the brutality of the Crucifixion is present within SON OF GOD, and is troubling and difficult to watch (as it should be).  Morgado does his best work here as Jesus, able to drop the Colgate smile and finally ACT, for heaven's sake.  Roma Downey, however, is just awful as Mary, and she seems to do nothing more than look pleadingly (but still beautifully!) at Jesus in all of his agony, tears glistening on her lovely cheeks as she stretches her hand to her son.  As a mother, if I was watching one of my sons go through something like this, I would be screaming and frothing at the mouth.SON OF GOD is a good, but not great film of the life and death of Jesus Christ.  That it is better at depicting the death of Jesus, in all of its misery and degradation, may be due simply to the belief that the public wants to see the torture more than the miracles.  But isn't the life of Christ, and his teachings, more important?  I think so, but I don't have millions to make a movie.  See the film, by all means, but remember how much more there is to the story of the Son of God than the tragedy of his death on the cross.

1694039,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00ICWO0ZY,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[0, 0]","The film starts with some narration by John, whose gospel introduces the concept of the &#34;logos&#34; or &#34;The Word&#34; and equates this Greek theological idea to Jesus . It places Jesus with God the father from the beginning of time.It jumps to a quick Matthew version of his birth and then to collecting apostles, making his first miracle being a human fish finder. Yes the Lord God creator and all being of time, space and dimension must stick his face into the water to locate fish. My LOL moment.The movie introduces historical background, but does so briefly. The famous Sermon on the Mount, what I consider to be the inspirational center piece of Christianity is not used, save for The Lord's Prayer. Even &#34;Life of Brian&#34; did that aspect better...&#34;Blessed are the cheese makers...&#34;The film nicely modernizes the King James version, even with the actors having varying accents. The film attempts to follow the story through the Gospel of John, which may be why they cut the sermon on the mount, but then they added other aspects that were not in John, but Matthew.The production makes Jesus look like a cult leader with a rock star following. The last hour which concentrates on the Passion of Christ, I couldn't help but compare it mentally to the far superior Mel Gibson production. Indeed, in many ways this film isn't any better than some low budget church productions.I liked the idea of opening with John. If they had made this film based strictly on the Gospel of John, they could of had a first. The story assumes we know the characters and never builds or develops them. The plot has wholes in it, like what was Pontius Pilate supposed to do with his wife's dream she considered a warning? Say, &#34;Okay Jesus off you go then.&#34; Wouldn't that screw up everyone's salvation?On the plus side Jesus Christ handled hecklers better than Chris Christie, but then, who doesn't? The film takes some dramatic liberties utilizing long &#34;William Shatner like&#34; pauses before Jesus says a line we know is coming. The scene of Judas &#34;returning&#34; the 30 pieces of silver, was nothing like what I imagined, my bad I guess.I really loved the rock star Jesus for the first 30-45 minutes of the film.

1694043,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00ICWO0ZY,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[98, 121]","When I first heard about the movie SON OF GOD, I didn't think it was a good idea. SON OF GOD is a movie that mostly contains re-edited scenes about Jesus from the 2013 miniseries THE BIBLE. There are some additional scenes in the movie, but the majority of it already appeared on television. I understand wanted to reach as large an audience as possible about the gospels (good news) of Jesus, but personally, it reeked a little too much like a money grab to me to simply re-edit television footage and add a few deleted scenes to make a movie that would be released in cinemas. However, I was willing to give the movie a chance and ended up seeing it in theatres twice.The movie begins with the apostle John, brother of James, on the island of Patmos. John begins to tell about Jesus in the form of a voice over, ""In the beginning there was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God."" The short intro takes the viewer through the creation of the world, the destruction of the Earth through flooding, and other events until the birth of Jesus. Then the movie quickly skips over a lifetime.When we next see Jesus, he is walking towards the shore (from out of the wilderness and the temptation with Satan it is to be assumed) and begins gathering disciples and followers and soon he has a core group of thirteen (that's right, thirteen; more on that later) disciples that travel with him as he goes about teaching, preaching, performing miracles, and seeming to ridicule the Pharisees who question him.Meanwhile, in Jerusalem word is brought to the high priest of the Jews, Caiaphas, of this man named Jesus. At first he doesn't think much of it and with the arrival of Pontius Pilate to the city, Caiaphas has more important matters at hand. However, as Jesus continues to do what he was doing, Caiaphas comes to see Jesus as someone who could bring harm and suffering to the Jews and, therefore, he must be eliminated.Jesus is betrayed, captured, and killed, but he rises from the grave. He appears to his disciples and suddenly disappears. The end of SON OF GOD returns to John on Patmos.In terms of cinematography and film values, SON OF GOD is an average movie. Some of the dialogue is taken from the Bible, but some of it is not Biblical and is very cheesy. The acting isn't terrible, but there are no outstanding or noteworthy performances, either. In terms of production values, SON OF GOD is better than most low budget movies, but it does not have the feel that a big screen movie should have. As mentioned earlier, SON OF GOD is mostly re-edited footage from the tv miniseries THE BIBLE and, for most of the movie, SON OF GOD looks like a tv movie. This won't be as big an issue with the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the movie, but if you watch SON OF GOD on a larger screen television, you can definitely notice a difference in the production values.In terms of a movie that's supposed to be a Bible-based movie, SON OF GOD is pure fluff that only uses the Bible for its core values, while ignoring the details and some of the more difficult and darker parts of scripture.Personally, the biggest Biblical error with SON OF GOD is that instead of twelve disciples there are thirteen and the thirteenth disciple is a woman named Mary. Yes, there were woman who followed Jesus around and some of them (not just one of them) was named Mary. However, there was never a disciple named Mary. When I first saw the Mary character I thought, ""Oh, that's a little different, but I understand why she's there."" However, it took me a little while to understand that this ""Mary"" wasn't just going to be a close follower of Jesus, she was actually going to be a disciple. She follows the men wherever they go: eating and sleeping in the same places. Not only that, but ""Mary"" is given some of the better lines in the movie. She jokes around with the boys, is outspoken, and reproves the other disciples for not having enough faith (also suggesting that her faith is stronger). She's there to comfort Martha at the death of her brother and she's there at the foot of the cross when Jesus is crucified. She's the first (and initially the only one) to see the empty tomb and it is she, not angels, who reminds the other disciples that Jesus said he would arise on the third day.There are many other Biblical changes, inaccuracies, alterations, and outright errors in SON OF GOD (for instance, Jesus doesn't know that Peter is going to deny him until he gives him a hug). Movies are a completely different medium than literature. I understand that. In telling a story on the screen, especially a story that covers three years (or all of history, really), you have to make changes and sacrifices to make a 2 - 2  hour movie that is not only appealing to believers, but to those who might not really know much about Jesus. I get that. However, there's no cinematic reason to add another disciple and make her a woman. I believe that the reason for doing so was to appeal to a wider (and more female) audience, but in doing so, SON OF GOD dilutes not only the message, but the messenger of Jesus himself.Overall, I was really disappointed with SON OF GOD. On a cinematic level, I expected the movie to be a better movie than it was. However, as a movie, SON OF GOD feels more like a big budget tv episode than it does a feature-length motion picture. In terms of Biblical and scriptural accuracy, SON OF GOD verges on heresy and seems to be more similar to the booksThe Holy Blood and the Holy GrailandThe Da Vinci Codethan the Bible. I realize that there are people who will be uplifted and inspired by what they see on the screen. However, if you want to see a movie that actually tries to stay true to more than just the spirit of scripture, I recommendJesus Film,Jesus of Nazareth, orThe Passion Of The Christ Definitive Edition.

I mean, wow.  The God of this Universe did all that world creating and then atoned us for our sins too?  What a guy.On the other hand if you don't mind some subtle questioning.  Isn't it a wee bit over reaching to come to this conclusion that any of the conjectures put forth in this movie could possibly be anything more than the wild crazed foolish hopes of some rather misguided though well intentioned desperate folks?First and foremost Caucasians weren't exactly populating the land of Israel back then so I don't think Jesus was as white as the guy in this flick-it'd be a stretch if he was if this was more than just fiction.  And well, I could go on with all sorts of other nitpicking but I'm sure none of you will want to read it and figure it's best if i wait til judgment day to get sent off into the great chasm of despair & hellfire.

1694052,AP3B615GM191G,B00ICWO0ZY,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[12, 18]","In 2004, Mel Gibson's &#34;The Passion of the Christ&#34; was a landmark film in its unflinching look at the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.  &#34;Son of God&#34; operates in a similar vein, while also focusing on more of the ministry of Christ before his death and resurrection.  The difference between the two?  This is a four-star solid film, while &#34;Passion&#34; is five stars because it was first and because it had a little more &#34;passion&#34; (pardon the pun) behind it.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Son of God&#34; is pretty much a straight re-telling of the Jesus story.  After a brief prologue about the Old Testament and Christ's birth, it begins with Jesus (Diogo Morgado) meeting his disciples as they are struggling to catch fish in the Sea of Galilee.  The &#34;walking on water&#34; scene quickly commences and the film is off and running.  It doesn't touch on every aspect of Jesus's ministry, but certain key moments are rendering in fantastic dramatic detail.  About half way through the film, it shifts gears and becomes a crucifixion/resurrection story, beginning with the involvement of Pontius Pilate (Greg Hicks).&#34;Son of God&#34; is not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination.  It is a faithful re-telling of the Jesus story...as simple as that.  Due to the success of &#34;The Bible&#34; miniseries on television, the show producers wanted to get something up on the big screen.  Considering the short time frame they had to work with, I would say they did a fine job of putting together the film.The reason it will always be second fiddle (at least to me) to &#34;Passion&#34;, though, is because of two main reasons (in this case I won't even fault &#34;Son of God&#34; for being second, even though that does have at least some impact): First, in &#34;Passion&#34;, Gibson quite literally poured his entire life into that project.  That kind of energy and effort showed up in the final product.  With &#34;Son of God&#34;, one can tell that even though the cast/crew/producers were trying, the effort was not to make a masterpiece.  Secondly, Jim Caviezel was just flat out a better Jesus than Morgado.  Like Gibson, Caviezel lived his role and set and (until recently with the success of &#34;Person of Interest&#34;) was practically known as Jesus in the film industry!So, while &#34;Son of God&#34; was a solid Jesus story flick, it will probably always play second-fiddle to &#34;Passion of the Christ&#34; for some of the reasons I listed above.  I don't see it as a problem that the Jesus story is re-told every 10 years or so in a new dramatic setting, but looking at things purely from a movie-critic perspective it just doesn't quite measure up to Gibson's 2004 piece.",4,"A Good Re-Telling Of The Jesus Story (If Lacking In ""Passion"")",1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,2719,"['2004', 'Mel', 'Gibson', '34', 'Passion', 'Christ', '34', 'was', 'landmark', 'film', 'unflinching', 'look', 'crucifixion', 'Jesus', 'Christ', '34', 'Son', 'God', '34', 'similar', 'vein', 'also', 'focusing', 'more', 'ministry', 'Christ', 'death', 'resurrection', 'difference', 'two', 'four-star', 'solid', 'film', '34', 'Passion', '34', 'five', 'stars', 'was', 'first', 'had', 'little', 'more', '34', 'passion', '34', 'pardon', 'pun', 'it.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', '34', 'Son', 'God', '34', 'pretty', 'much', 'straight', 're-telling', 'Jesus', 'story', 'brief', 'prologue', 'Old', 'Testament', 'Christ', 'birth', 'Jesus', 'Diogo', 'Morgado', 'meeting', 'disciples', 'are', 'struggling', 'catch', 'fish', 'Sea', 'Galilee', '34', 'walking', 'water', '34', 'scene', 'quickly', 'commences', 'film', 'running', ""n't"", 'touch', 'aspect', 'Jesus', 'ministry', 'certain', 'key', 'moments', 'are', 'rendering', 'fantastic', 'dramatic', 'detail', 'half', 'way', 'film', 'gears', 'crucifixion/resurrection', 'story', 'beginning', 'involvement', 'Pontius', 'Pilate', 'Greg', 'Hicks', '34', 'Son', 'God', '34', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'faithful', 're-telling', 'Jesus', 'story', 'as', 'simple', 'Due', 'success', '34', 'Bible', '34', 'miniseries', 'television', 'show', 'producers', 'wanted', 'get', 'something', 'up', 'big', 'screen', 'Considering', 'short', 'time', 'frame', 'had', 'work', 'would', 'say', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'putting', 'together', 'film.The', 'reason', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'second', 'fiddle', 'least', '34', 'Passion', '34', 'two', 'main', 'reasons', 'case', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'fault', '34', 'Son', 'God', '34', 'being', 'second', 'even', 'have', 'least', 'impact', 'First', '34', 'Passion', '34', 'Gibson', 'quite', 'literally', 'poured', 'entire', 'life', 'project', 'kind', 'energy', 'effort', 'showed', 'up', 'final', 'product', '34', 'Son', 'God', '34', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'even', 'cast/crew/producers', 'were', 'trying', 'effort', 'was', 'not', 'make', 'masterpiece', 'Secondly', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'was', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'better', 'Jesus', 'Morgado', 'Gibson', 'Caviezel', 'lived', 'role', 'set', 'recently', 'success', '34', 'Person', 'Interest', '34', 'was', 'practically', 'known', 'Jesus', 'film', 'industry', 'So', '34', 'Son', 'God', '34', 'was', 'solid', 'Jesus', 'story', 'flick', 'will', 'probably', 'always', 'play', 'second-fiddle', '34', 'Passion', 'Christ', '34', 'reasons', 'listed', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'problem', 'Jesus', 'story', 're-told', '10', 'years', 'so', 'new', 'dramatic', 'setting', 'looking', 'things', 'purely', 'movie-critic', 'perspective', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'measure', 'up', 'Gibson', '2004', 'piece']",N/A
