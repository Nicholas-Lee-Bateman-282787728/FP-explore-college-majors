The acting seems genuine - including Elijah Wood (in his first post Frodo role) which has the innocent look to carry off his character. The mood & environment are very well established.Edward Burns' commentary track may be of special interest to people who are interested in the making of indie / low budget films, even though I think this subject comes up in many of his commentaries.",4,"Interesting mood piece, not much of a crime drama",1090713600,"07 25, 2004",2004,890,"['Edward', 'Burns', 'movie', 'tries', 'investigate', 'subject', 'close', 'creator', 'heart', 'lives', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'brothers', 'NYC.This', 'may', 'cause', 'lot', 'people', 'see', 'Burns', 'one', 'hit', 'wonder', 'movies', 'characters', 'do', 'seem', 'have', 'lot', 'common', 'so', 'much', 'fact', 'stories', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'movies', 'main', 'attraction', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'destinguish', 'smaller', 'details', 'them.Having', 'said', 'story', 'other', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'actually', 'acting', 'genuine', 'including', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'first', 'post', 'Frodo', 'role', 'innocent', 'look', 'carry', 'off', 'character', 'mood', 'environment', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'established.Edward', 'Burns', 'commentary', 'track', 'may', 'be', 'special', 'interest', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'making', 'indie', '/', 'low', 'budget', 'films', 'even', 'think', 'subject', 'up', 'many', 'commentaries']",Ash Wednesday
731042,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B00007L4KT,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[0, 0]","""Ash Wednesday"" is a lovably bad movie. It's best paired with its sister flickAsh Wednesday [VHS], a Liz Taylor/Peter Fonda soap opera about adultery, plastic surgery,and an older woman with a younger guy before it was hip. It's the only Elijah Wood straight-to-DVD movie with its own soundtrack (Ash Wednesday) It's set in the '80s, with music from Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Scorpions... but don't expect Prince, Madonna getting in the groove, or the King of Pop himself, Michael Jackson. It's a guilty pleasure, but not THAT much of a guilty pleasure.""Ash Wednesday"" was filmed for 8 days inHell's Kitchen: Season 1, albeit without Gordon Ramsay or Marco Pierre White (rest assured, there's plenty of cussing), afterThe Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Theatrical Editions + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray] finished production. Ed Burns stars as Francis, a troubled Irish hoodlum, whose brother Sean (Elijah Wood) has faked his death after a shoot-out. Sean has been living in hiding for three years. There's talk around town that Frodo lives. What is Francis going to do, since he's also enjoying his brother's ""widow"" Grace (Rosario Dawson,Rent (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition),Josie and The Pussycats)? Yes, there are heavy-handed metaphors, including Francis' priest friend, his ex Maggie who says she's seen Sean, and Oliver Platt as a bad guy. The movie is set on Ash Wednesday, there's talk of forgiveness, repentance, resurrection, Maggie representing a Mary Magdalene who's seen the risen Sean... it has the depth of a Sunday School play, if it had obscenities.Ed Burns and Oliver Platt are convincing in their respective roles;Burns is angsty, Platt is slimy. On the other hand, Dawson doesn't get much screen time, since this is noSin City. Wood is unintentionally hilarious as Burns' brother-they're supposed to be related. Yet they do not look like brothers. This calls for a Maury Povich paternity test. The sight of Wood cussing, worrying about whether is brother is having fun with his wife... he does it with wide-eyed hobbit innocence (is it any wonder the composer of the soundtrack is named David Shire?) Wood is unconvincing as Burns' brother, Rosario's lover, and an Irish gangster. No surprise that the opening scene is at a pub named Blarney.""Ash Wednesday"" has as much convincing Celticness asCeltic Woman, green beer, andLucky Charms Cereal, 11.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3).

To reveal the storyline implausibilities would ruin the movie for anyone hellbent on wasting the money or time to rent this. If it's snowing or raining and you're trapped indoors I suppose you could waste the time seeing it on cable.Not in a million years is a love relationship even feasible between Elijah Wood and Rosario Dawson.Had Burns cast Stephen Dorff or Sean Patrick Flannery at least we could have watched the movie without a vomitous reaction to how horribly miscast Wood was.Burns' smart-aleck dialogue has gotten very long in the tooth.

But not even Elijah Wood could hope to salvage anything of this very boring, very irritating movie.Let me just say that Edward Burns does not do a very good job in impressing anybody. It always seems as though the basic element of his films is swearing, swearing...and more swearing. So much in fact that it begins to grate on our already raw nerves, nerves that began to snap after the first ten minutes of this film.Also, what brother would, or could do such an evil thing to his brother as to tell his 'supposed' widow her husband was cruelly murdered, and then sleep with her behind his very much alive brothers back.The complete lack of sympathy or compassion that Edward Burn portrays in this film and in Confidence makes one wonder what he's really trying to prove. Maybe that a dead pan face and even deader sense of acting really can make produce a movie.Not even the music, which was rather creepy, could save this.

Set in New York's Hell's Kitchen in the 1980's the film has a gritty feel which suits the story of the two Irish-American brothers, played by Elijah Wood and Edward Burns, perfectly.  The movie begins on Ash Wednesday when Wood's character hears three members of an Italian crew saying they're going to kill his brother over his gambling debts.  He kills them before they have a chance than disappears from town, presumed dead.Three years later, also on Ash Wednesday, Wood's character is spotted in town which sets the dominos falling.  The rival gang leader wants his pound of flesh and Burns is in the crossfire.  In the meantime, Burn's character has fallen in love with his brother's wife, who thinks her husband is dead.Overall, I found the movie to be very enjoyable.

In a nutshell, it's Edward Burns' latest movie, &quot;Ash Wednesday,&quot; a surprisingly  poignant and thrilling action movie about two Irish-American brothers caught in a very dangerous position.  Though it's a little uneven, especially in the first half, the intensity makes it worth seeing.The date is Ash Wednesday, 1980. The place: Hell's Kitchen. Sean Sullivan (Elijah Wood) is tending bar when he overhears three thugs plotting to kill his brother Francis (Edward Burns). So takes out a gun and kills all three of them to keep Francis alive. After that night, everyone hears that Sean is dead, and life continues for Francis and Sean's young wife (Rosario Dawson) for three years.What no one knows is that Sean is really alive. And soon Francis begins to hear rumors that Sean has been seen hanging around the neighborhood. Little brother wants his wife back (unaware that he now has a baby son). Problem is, if he is still alive, then there are some scores yet to be settled. And Francis may have to pay the price to keep his family safe.Revenge stories have been with us since... well, a very long time. And &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; is noteworthy less for the complexity of its story (it really doesn't have any) than for HOW it's told. Family loyalty in movies is something that can rarely be done without sappiness, but amazingly Burns strips it down and makes it very moving. The first half is kind of slow, with a lot of Burns walking around and looking grim. But things pick up and compensate in the second half with more guns, dangerous strangers and family problems.Burns' directorial style is as gritty and shadowy as the place he sets his film in; the brief twenty-day shooting schedule probably added to the feeling of urgency. Symbolism abounds in Burns' latest flick; for example the ash crosses, part of a Roman Catholic ritual right before Lent, serve as a reminder of mortality. During some of the most important (and potentially deadly) scenes, Burns and Wood have those marks on their foreheads. It's a nice extra dimension, considering that most action flicks don't have more than one or two levels on them.Burns does an excellent job with a character who has a rather rotten past, and now has a need to protect the people he loves. Wood doesn't appear for much of the movie, but does an exceptional job when he does; his wide range is evident through the movie, whether he's cooing at his baby son or snarling as he guns down the thugs. Dawson doesn't really have a chance to do much, but is quite good with the confusion her character feels.Burns' sharp-edged flick about choices and loyalty goes a bit deeper than your average revenge flick. Though flawed by an uneven pace and simple story, &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; is well-acted and very compelling. Certainly worth a watch.",4,&quot;Ash&quot; burns,1076716800,"02 14, 2004",2004,2891,"['gritty', 'dirty', 'violent', 'scary', 'little', 'ash', 'crosses', 'nutshell', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'latest', 'movie', 'quot', 'Ash', 'Wednesday', 'quot', 'surprisingly', 'poignant', 'thrilling', 'action', 'movie', 'two', 'Irish-American', 'brothers', 'caught', 'very', 'dangerous', 'position', 'little', 'uneven', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'intensity', 'seeing.The', 'date', 'Ash', 'Wednesday', '1980', 'place', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'Sean', 'Sullivan', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'tending', 'bar', 'when', 'three', 'thugs', 'plotting', 'kill', 'brother', 'Francis', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'So', 'out', 'gun', 'kills', 'three', 'keep', 'Francis', 'alive', 'night', 'everyone', 'hears', 'Sean', 'dead', 'life', 'Francis', 'Sean', 'young', 'wife', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'three', 'years.What', 'one', 'Sean', 'really', 'alive', 'soon', 'Francis', 'hear', 'rumors', 'Sean', 'been', 'seen', 'hanging', 'neighborhood', 'Little', 'brother', 'wife', 'back', 'unaware', 'now', 'baby', 'son', 'Problem', 'still', 'alive', 'then', 'are', 'scores', 'yet', 'be', 'settled', 'Francis', 'may', 'have', 'pay', 'price', 'keep', 'family', 'safe.Revenge', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'quot', 'Ash', 'Wednesday', 'quot', 'noteworthy', 'less', 'complexity', 'story', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'HOW', 'told', 'Family', 'loyalty', 'movies', 'something', 'can', 'rarely', 'be', 'done', 'sappiness', 'amazingly', 'Burns', 'down', 'very', 'moving', 'first', 'half', 'kind', 'slow', 'lot', 'Burns', 'walking', 'around', 'looking', 'grim', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'compensate', 'second', 'half', 'more', 'guns', 'dangerous', 'strangers', 'family', 'problems.Burns', 'directorial', 'style', 'gritty', 'shadowy', 'place', 'film', 'brief', 'twenty-day', 'shooting', 'schedule', 'probably', 'added', 'feeling', 'urgency', 'Symbolism', 'Burns', 'latest', 'flick', 'example', 'ash', 'crosses', 'part', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'ritual', 'right', 'Lent', 'serve', 'reminder', 'mortality', 'most', 'important', 'potentially', 'deadly', 'scenes', 'Burns', 'Wood', 'have', 'marks', 'foreheads', 'nice', 'extra', 'dimension', 'considering', 'most', 'action', 'flicks', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'one', 'two', 'levels', 'them.Burns', 'excellent', 'job', 'character', 'who', 'rather', 'rotten', 'past', 'now', 'need', 'protect', 'people', 'Wood', ""n't"", 'appear', 'much', 'movie', 'exceptional', 'job', 'when', 'wide', 'range', 'evident', 'movie', 'cooing', 'baby', 'son', 'snarling', 'down', 'thugs', 'Dawson', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'chance', 'do', 'much', 'quite', 'good', 'confusion', 'character', 'feels.Burns', 'sharp-edged', 'flick', 'choices', 'loyalty', 'bit', 'deeper', 'average', 'revenge', 'flick', 'flawed', 'uneven', 'pace', 'simple', 'story', 'quot', 'Ash', 'Wednesday', 'quot', 'well-acted', 'very', 'compelling', 'Certainly', 'watch']",Ash Wednesday
731050,AKUGGJWVJ8QMQ,B00007L4KT,"Edward C. Patterson ""Edward C. Patterson""","[8, 8]","Ash Wednesday is a dark movie with a prosaic plot line and a simple theme. But like many simple things, there are layers of complexity in the fabric of this film-mostly from the sturdy script and the superlative character acting. The viewer is given a New York texture-the old neighborhood, even if the Hell's Kitchen area of New York City was leveled twenty years prior to the action-the look and feel is just about right to our mind for a grim Irish Catholic object lesson with a Johnny One-Note theme.Ed Burns, and it is Ed Burns' film, delivers a solid performance as the repentant Francis Sullivan, who is seeking salvation from his former life. He's not so repentant that he's above adultery, but his brother Sean is supposed to be permanently out of the picture -so does adultery count? Francis is an intense character, gaining credibility through repetitive phrasing as if the only way he knows the next steps are by repeating them. He also wins the F word award as the only adjective in his vocabulary-although his metaphors are as colorful as Archie Bunkers. Burns is riveting in his portrayal and the rest of the cast rides along on the tracks he lays.Elijah Wood, in an unusual role for him, plays the younger brother, who is imaginative, college material and forward looking, if not a dreamer-but not above killing three men on impulse and returning from the dead on a whim. Wood gives us a foil against Burns' character. While Francis is focused, Sean is not. He lives in a fantasy world (sometimes). He's angry at other times. There could even be a tinge of bi-polarism in this character. Wood unsettles us in his remarkable portrayal, which leaves the character unresolved and allows the audience to forecast Sean's ultimate failure.Mallachy McCourt as Whitey, the Irish Godfather, gives us a stereotype, but exactly with the right tessitura to make the neighborhood more Irish than Italian. Oliver Platt is excellent as the rival Mike Moran-menacing and uncompromising, vengeful and the villain-type we all cheer when he's killed. Rosario Dawson as Grace Quinonez adds the anguish to the texture, as Burns doesn't do anguish and Wood can't come down to earth long enough to deliver it. As the wife in love with two brothers and the victim of circumstance, she's a bit like Juliet and as such, James Handy, as Father Mahoney, plays the Friar. In fact, the film has many Romeo and Juliet parallels-a hero who murders to protect his best friend (in this case, his brother); a meddlesome nurse (in this case a barfly named Maggie Shea); gang rivalry although not to the pitch of the Montagues and Capulets; and, of course, the theme that families must pay for their darkest crimes with the blood of the innocent (in this case, the not-so-innocent).The unrelenting darkness of Ash Wednesday, after all Ash Wednesday is supposed to be a heavy day of atonement, might not be for all tastes. However, with a Shakespearean texture, solid performances from Burns and Wood (and the supporting cast of types), this film should not be overlooked, even though you might not pop it in your DVD player as often as The Lord of the Rings.

The lighting is creepily superb and the filming techniques are in keeping with the overall mood of the piece.

But there are so marveolous moments of moviemaking in this stiff, leisurely and ultimately unsatisfying film.Opening on Ash Wednesday in 1980 and closing on the day after Ash Wednesday 1983, the movie paints a bleak and oppressive view of gangland violence; of family loyalties; of deception and love lost and regained.  It's interesting to see the Catholics with the ashen crosses on their foreheads, talking about offing someone or using the F word to the umpteenth level of tediousness.  Burns as a screenwriter should have known better to infuse such foul language throughout the whole movie.  I've always thought when the F word is used so much, the writer couldn't come up with anything really important to say.There's a lot of religious symbolism about mortality, repentance and forgiveness, too.Another problem is that Burns didn't really give us a character to really care about.  Even though the tragic end is not pleasant, what else could there be?  Even in his heroic role, Burns is still a cold-blooded killer; his attempts at repentance don't really change him, and he commits the cardinal sin of sleeping with his brother's wife, knowing that his brother is really alive.Burns does a good job in his role as Francis, a tormented young man who does his best to protect his brother and the brother's wife and son; no one even bothers to tell Sean that he has a son.Elijah Wood tries hard, but he's horribly miscast.  He seems mature and adult when he shoots the three men who are planning to kill Francis, but when he comes back, he seems just like Frodo, all youthful innocence and his stupid act of going out for a drink only reinforces the lad's immaturity.Rosario Dawson isn't given much of a role, but sadly doesn't do much with what she is given.Oliver Platt infuses his usual disgusting villainy into a smaller role, but he pulls it off well.  James Handy as Father Mahoney also does a good job.The photography is imaginative and the scenes of NY's Hell's Kitchen evoke a mood of gloom and hopelessness.The musical score by David Shire is one of the most irritating scores I've had the displeasure to hear.  The redundant use of the same solo piano runs gets awfully tedious; they're used too much and tend to distract more than accent the scenes.ASH WEDNESDAY is a movie that might have been better, but if this is what Burns wanted to convey, one can only hope he matures in his future endeavors.",3,A SEASON OF REPENTANCE,1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,2524,"['ASH', 'WEDNESDAY', 'obviously', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'personal', 'paean', 'lifestyle', 'long', 'come', 'gone', 'are', 'so', 'marveolous', 'moments', 'moviemaking', 'stiff', 'leisurely', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfying', 'film.Opening', 'Ash', 'Wednesday', '1980', 'closing', 'day', 'Ash', 'Wednesday', '1983', 'movie', 'bleak', 'oppressive', 'view', 'gangland', 'violence', 'family', 'loyalties', 'deception', 'love', 'lost', 'regained', 'interesting', 'see', 'Catholics', 'ashen', 'foreheads', 'talking', 'offing', 'someone', 'using', 'F', 'word', 'umpteenth', 'level', 'tediousness', 'Burns', 'screenwriter', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'infuse', 'such', 'foul', 'language', 'whole', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'when', 'F', 'word', 'used', 'so', 'much', 'writer', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'really', 'important', 'say.There', 'lot', 'religious', 'symbolism', 'mortality', 'repentance', 'forgiveness', 'too.Another', 'problem', 'Burns', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'character', 'really', 'care', 'Even', 'tragic', 'end', 'not', 'pleasant', 'what', 'else', 'could', 'there', 'be', 'Even', 'heroic', 'role', 'Burns', 'still', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'attempts', 'repentance', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'change', 'cardinal', 'sin', 'sleeping', 'brother', 'wife', 'knowing', 'brother', 'really', 'alive.Burns', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'Francis', 'tormented', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'best', 'protect', 'brother', 'brother', 'wife', 'son', 'one', 'even', 'bothers', 'tell', 'Sean', 'son.Elijah', 'Wood', 'tries', 'hard', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'mature', 'adult', 'when', 'shoots', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'planning', 'kill', 'Francis', 'when', 'back', 'just', 'Frodo', 'youthful', 'innocence', 'stupid', 'act', 'going', 'out', 'drink', 'only', 'lad', 'immaturity.Rosario', 'Dawson', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'role', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'what', 'given.Oliver', 'Platt', 'usual', 'disgusting', 'villainy', 'smaller', 'role', 'off', 'well', 'James', 'Handy', 'Father', 'Mahoney', 'also', 'good', 'job.The', 'photography', 'imaginative', 'scenes', 'NY', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'evoke', 'mood', 'gloom', 'hopelessness.The', 'musical', 'score', 'David', 'Shire', 'one', 'most', 'irritating', 'scores', ""'ve"", 'had', 'displeasure', 'hear', 'redundant', 'use', 'same', 'solo', 'piano', 'awfully', 'tedious', ""'re"", 'used', 'too', 'much', 'tend', 'distract', 'more', 'accent', 'scenes.ASH', 'WEDNESDAY', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'what', 'Burns', 'wanted', 'convey', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'future', 'endeavors']",Ash Wednesday

Moore,"[1, 1]","&quot;Ash Wednesday,&quot; actor-writer-director Edward Burns' attempt at an urban thriller, works beautifully as a mood piece but fails to be fully convincing as a crime drama. Set in the early 1980s in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen section, &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; is about Francis Sullivan, a young Irish mobster trying to go straight, and what happens when his brother Sean--supposedly killed by rival thugs after whacking three of their crew--suddenly reappears after three years. Burns marinates us in the color and flavor of the gritty neighborhood--the photography, a palette of browns and grays, sets an intriguing tone, and David Shire's moody, jazzy piano score is a wow. But all the detail in the world can't hide the basic thinness of the story. We've seen variations on this story a thousand times before--from &quot;Public Enemy&quot; to &quot;Mean Streets&quot;--and Burns has nothing new to add. The cast is great--besides Burns as Francis, you have Elijah Wood as Sean and Rosario Dawson, Malachy McCourt, Oliver Platt and others in supporting roles. But although the actors give their all, we never feel we have enough background about the characters for them to really come to life. And the ending, meant to be a shocker, merely seems gratuitous. In all, the best you can say about &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; is that it's an interesting disappointment. (Another disappointment: I wanted to buy the soundtrack CD for &quot;Ash Wednesday,&quot; but discovered on this website that it contains NONE of Shire's outstanding music--only the songs on the jukebox in the characters' favorite hangout.

The Director's commentary on the CD was extremely interesting and pointed out things about the production of the film that were less than obvious. As a comparison, 'Sleepers' was another film that dealt with some aspects of Hell's Kitchen, even though the story was vastly different. Even so, parts of 'Ash Wednesday' had the same sort of feel. Maybe it was the mindset.However, I'm sure that this film will have a narrower demographic appeal than films like 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Star Wars', simply because of the religious, ethnic and class issues that define the structure of 'Ash Wednesday'. If your background is something other than Irish Catholic, you're not male, and you're not familiar with life in the big city, then you'll probably have to work at understanding the film's characters and the story itself.The story is well thought out, but it obviously wasn't meant for the same audience that buys into Paris Hilton, the 'Atkins' diet, or enjoys watching 'reality' shows on television.  That alone is refreshing.  I hope that Edward Burns continues to make films as well-crafted as this one.",5,A film for a thinking audience -,1118620800,"06 13, 2005",2005,1925,"['extraordinary', 'film', 'considering', 'was', 'shot', 'only', '20', 'days', 'cost', 'two', 'half', 'million.Ed', 'Burns', 'Francis', 'Sullivan', 'oldest', 'son', 'union', 'boss', 'former', 'longshoreman', 'first-class', 'killer', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Sean', 'Sullivan', 'Francis', 'younger', 'brother', 'killer', 'default', 'Sean', 'exiled', 'place', 'somewhere', 'neighborhood', 'own', 'good', 'one', 'day', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'story', 'going', 'plot', 'synopsis', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'explain', 'something', 'can', 'see', 'will', 'say', 'plot', 'character-driven', 'very', 'logical', 'manner.Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Burns', 'always', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'believable', 'Sean', 'soundtrack', 'good', 'so', 'cinematography', 'director', 'Burns', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Director', 'commentary', 'CD', 'was', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'pointed', 'out', 'things', 'production', 'film', 'were', 'less', 'obvious', 'comparison', ""'Sleepers"", 'was', 'film', 'aspects', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'even', 'story', 'was', 'vastly', 'different', 'Even', 'so', 'parts', ""'Ash"", 'Wednesday', 'had', 'same', 'sort', 'feel', 'Maybe', 'was', 'mindset.However', ""'m"", 'sure', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'narrower', 'demographic', 'appeal', 'films', ""'Lord"", 'Rings', ""'Star"", 'Wars', 'simply', 'religious', 'ethnic', 'class', 'issues', 'define', 'structure', ""'Ash"", 'Wednesday', 'background', 'something', 'other', 'Irish', 'Catholic', ""'re"", 'not', 'male', ""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'life', 'big', 'city', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'work', 'understanding', 'film', 'characters', 'story', 'itself.The', 'story', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'obviously', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'same', 'audience', 'Paris', 'Hilton', ""'Atkins"", 'diet', 'watching', ""'reality"", 'shows', 'television', 'alone', 'refreshing', 'hope', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'make', 'films', 'as', 'well-crafted', 'one']",Ash Wednesday
