1091803,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B000TS9G3U,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[4, 4]","After years of reading and hearing how good this film is, I finally saw it last night.Why is this masterpiece not on (legitimate) DVD?Essentially, it the story of JG as Gigot. He is a mute janitor in Paris, living in squalor and the butt of cruel humor in his neighborhood. One rainy night, he comes across a prostitute (a fact that is implied, remember this is a 1962 film) and her small daughter out in the rain. JG takes this couple to his slum apartment. While the lady of the night is as cruel to JG as everyone else, he bonds with the daughter.Many people compare this film to Chaplin's THE KID. I disagree. I find it closer in spirit to Harry Langdon's ""Three's a Crowd"" (1927), as both Langdon and Gleason's characters are more of social outcasts than Chaplin's tramp. Some other viewers correctly mention the connection between this and Gleason's POOR SOUL character-the mute who preseveres in spite of ridicule from society-who appeared on the JG variety show in the 50s and 60s (sadly overshadowed by Ralph Kramden in public memory today). In either case, he transcends these similar concepts to make this film a story all his own.There are some really memorable scenes in this film. The locals get their kicks out of getting JG drunk and watching him dance at the local pub. The cruelty in this scene is heart-wrenching, as is the scene where JG takes the girl to church and tries to explain the concept of Jesus to her. That one scene is to me JG's shining moment captured on film.There are also some good laughs as JG dances to amuse the girl (his dancing here will be of added amusement to JG fans as they will recognize the moves of one of his other characters, playboy Reginald Van Gleason), and where he tries to follow the girl on the merry go round. You'll stand up and cheer for JG in the chase scene in the last 3rd of the film.Speaking of the end, when it seems that you could predict the ending of the film in the last third of it or so, it takes a couple of surprising twists. The ending may not be satisfying to some (and no, I won't give it away here), but it does not subtract from the fact that the viewer has had quite and experience watching this.The critics were not kind to this film in 1962, but the generation who either saw it as children at the time or stumbled on to it later seems (judging by the reviews on this and other sites) to unanimously love it, which justifies a (legit) DVD release (unauthorized versions abound). What are they waiting for! Bring this classic back to light for all to see and enjoy! This was Jackie Gleason's personal favorite of all his films. It's not hard to see why.",5,JG's favorite of his films.

1091804,A2YH3YTPSCAWF9,B000TS9G3U,"Anthony Marinelli ""marilread""","[2, 2]","When we watch this film it really shows or projects what a good actor and comic jackie gleason was and when he makes a tv show he acts as the medium inspires him and here film..he cleanses his mind of all the tv entertainer and standup comics antics and trying to please and respond to audience cues here the actor is here..and although some critics lambasted him for this signature film..they may not have liked it,,but we must give him credit(a person who never won an oscar or emmy)for turning in an excellent film performance, a medium he respects. He grew up extremely poor alomost a youth without light, family breaking apart, drunkeness..and although he looked back in horror at this life in his personal life he later copied many of the vices he deplored in this home. Audrey Meadows recalls his office full of books on psychology, hypnotism..trying to retrieve memories that would make his life clear..like a looking glass to see the world at large...he was on tv the great entertainer from the early fifties to 1970..he started at warners after Jack warner saw his stand up and offered him$500/wk..as a bit player was he worth that $$..his show was a show of many comic characterizations tuned to tv and the Miami audience live, the cast rehearsed he didnt...in his office with a bottle of champagne..all those jokes of living it up..go back to his youth..now the standup and the tv comic..make the transition to film..having grown up in film on sets..he watched great movie stars..up close..watched and learn...and he still is the poor soul..the Chaplin type character like the KID..which this film resembles..but its curtailed and refined for film..is Bob Hope so good..are steve martin eddie murphy..Robin Williams..who also come from different entertainment mediums are faced with the same problem and at times lost they may appear deadpan or wooden..its a difficult problem for the actor..and here we have the lower class person living in the basement..not upstairs..dark and gloomy surroundings and like the later child he interacts with the animal world like the later child but not the prostitue..he picks up stray animals acts out a scene in a bar(good stuff and act) and from animals a prostitute and wayward little girl..and places all his attention on the girl..the little girl and forgets his own world and life and exists in her world and environment..and there is a carnival scene where the clown comes in..by the way this movie is in France not the U.S.and eventually the prostitute leaves..removes herself from his environment and as she sais ""care"" just the girl remains and the basement collapses..a symbol of his world and he elaborates his own death..the town believes him dead..and later they see him alive..the town who hates him..and chases him away..there are also many religious scenes and he tries to instruct the little girl in the suffering image of jesus,,the mystical world of religion..dealing with suffering..and there's a funeral he attends at the start..of a community person who is a symbol of  apatriot cleaning up his community and dedicated to service..who later dies at the war front..as he too dies and a film's end..fakes a death..and later dies a pseudo death..at the hands of the town and all he stands for..chased out of the city..abandoned..a similar film is Papa's little Dividend..see also Requiem for a Heavyweight,Ski Doo and How to Commit Marriage..how about How Do I LOve Thee..after his show ended he did many character films but the dont stand up to his 60's starring film roles too few in number unfortunately..really a talented performer who was taught early in films and learned, part of his mystical nature, a great entertainer since he could do so much on stage..and really took his cue from the audience ..MIAMI BEACH..on the old show a cyclist crashes against a wall and on the other side sees a poster for GIGOT..and the crowd applauds..I doubt it was much of a success outside of Miami..he had trouble financing..he probably paid out to make it..I'm not sure..the prestigious film company Seven Arts helped finance and produced it..a great film performance...from someone who started out in stage and films he wasnt really able to portray the romantic chaplin type character for lack of opportunity..although we see some of it in HOw do I Love Thee..he achieved great personal success but his personal life fell apart and continually came crashing down leading to personal excesses and frequent hospitalizations..GIGOT about finding a home was a lifelong endeavor of his and battling loneliness, finding intimacy..",4,Gleason's homage to old film stands-up,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,4587,"['When', 'watch', 'film', 'really', 'projects',

Along with my review of this Jackie Gleason film, I give all of the reviewers 5 Stars! READ THEM! They say everything that needs to be said. Every reviewer rated the film 5 stars. One important thing I can add is that 'Gigot' was directed by another ""great one"" Gene Kelley, and that as a 'Mime' Gleason is equal to or better than Marcel Marceau. Gleason was never better. He delivers in this film the acting performance of his lifetime. ""How Sweet It ('Gigot') Is""!There have been few films with acting as good as Gleason in 'Gigot'. Some of them are: Jimmie Stewart in 'It's a Wonderful Life', Julie Andrews in 'Sound of Music', Rickie Schroeder in 'The Champ', The two boys in 'Boy in the Stripped Pajamas', Lon Chaney Jr. in 'Of Mice and Men', and the actors in the newly released motion picture '17 Miracles'. Two short films with equally remarkable acting performances are: Francis Urry in 'Windows of Heaven' and Lethe Tatge in 'The Mailbox' (Won the highest award in it's category in 6 International Film Festivals). See Francis Urry's Bio on Google. If you search for Lethe Tatge on Google, there will be a link where you can watch 'The Mailbox' online. 'Gigot' can also be seen online but it is in six parts.'Gigot' is an ever so simple story about a deaf mute that you will never forget (and I only review films that will do this).This morning 8-15-13, I realized why I love this film so much. it has to be one of best motion pictures of all time.Gigot (the deaf mute) would join every funeral procession (whether he knew the person who had died or not) and weep with the mourners. He even joined his own funeral procession which is a hilarious scene from the film.  The following poem by John Donne expresses the virtue of such empathy.No man is an island,Each man's death diminishes me,For I am involved in mankind.Therefore, send not to knowFor whom the bell tolls,It tolls for thee.Ask not for whom the funeral bells toll, they toll for THEE, for every man is YOUR brother a part of our great human family. To mourn with those that mourn, even mourning for those we do not know, to understand and feel how ohers feel inside, is one of the most noble of virtues. Nothing on film or in literature shows the virtue of empathy better than the film Gigot.See all of my Reviews. I write only about books, events, or motion pictures that have changed the course of history or unforgettable books or motion pictures that will totally change peoples lives.Darrell Stoddard, Founder - Pain Research Institute and saveusa.biz",5,"Belongs next to 'It's a Wonderful Life""",1319241600,"10 22, 2011",2011,2682,"['Darrell', 'Stoddard', 'darrellstoddard', '@', 'gmail.comAs', 'heart', 'warmer', ""'Gigot"", 'belongs', 'motion', 'picture', ""'It"", 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Sound', 'Music', 'review', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'film', 'give', 'reviewers', '5', 'Stars', 'READ', 'THEM', 'say', 'everything', 'be', 'said', 'Every', 'reviewer', 'rated', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'One', 'important', 'thing', 'can', 'add', ""'Gigot"", 'was', 'directed', 'great', 'one', 'Gene', 'Kelley', ""'Mime"", 'Gleason', 'equal', 'better', 'Marcel', 'Marceau', 'Gleason', 'was', 'never', 'better', 'film', 'acting', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'How', 'Sweet', ""'Gigot"", 'have', 'been', 'few', 'films', 'acting', 'as', 'good', 'Gleason', ""'Gigot"", 'are', 'Jimmie', 'Stewart', ""'It"", 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Julie', 'Andrews', ""'Sound"", 'Music', 'Rickie', 'Schroeder', ""'The"", 'Champ', 'two', 'boys', ""'Boy"", 'Stripped', 'Pajamas', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', ""'Of"", 'Mice', 'Men', 'actors', 'newly', 'released', 'motion', 'picture', 'Miracles', 'Two', 'short', 'films', 'equally', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'Francis', 'Urry', ""'Windows"", 'Heaven', 'Lethe', 'Tatge', ""'The"", 'Mailbox', 'highest', 'award', 'category', '6', 'International', 'Film', 'Festivals', 'See', 'Francis', 'Urry', 'Bio', 'Google', 'search', 'Lethe', 'Tatge', 'Google', 'will', 'be', 'link', 'where', 'can', 'watch', ""'The"", 'Mailbox', 'online', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'seen', 'online', 'six', 'parts', 'ever', 'so', 'simple', 'story', 'deaf', 'mute', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'only', 'review', 'films', 'will', 'do', 'morning', '8-15-13', 'realized', 'why', 'love', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'motion', 'pictures', 'time.Gigot', 'deaf', 'mute', 'would', 'join', 'funeral', 'procession', 'knew', 'person', 'who', 'had', 'died', 'not', 'mourners', 'even', 'joined', 'own', 'funeral', 'procession', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'film', 'following', 'poem', 'John', 'Donne', 'virtue', 'such', 'empathy.No', 'man', 'island', 'man', 'death', 'diminishes', 'am', 'involved', 'mankind.Therefore', 'send', 'not', 'knowFor', 'whom', 'bell', 'tolls', 'thee.Ask', 'not', 'whom', 'funeral', 'bells', 'toll', 'toll', 'THEE', 'man', 'brother', 'part', 'great', 'human', 'family', 'mourn', 'mourn', 'even', 'mourning', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'understand', 'feel', 'how', 'ohers', 'feel', 'inside', 'one', 'most', 'noble', 'virtues', 'Nothing', 'film', 'literature', 'virtue', 'empathy', 'better', 'film', 'Gigot.See', 'Reviews', 'write', 'only', 'about', 'books', 'events', 'motion', 'pictures', 'have', 'changed', 'course', 'history', 'unforgettable', 'books', 'motion', 'pictures', 'will', 'totally', 'change', 'peoples', 'lives.Darrell', 'Stoddard', 'Founder', 'Pain', 'Research', 'Institute', 'saveusa.biz']",Gigot
