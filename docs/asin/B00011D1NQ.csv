790499,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00011D1NQ,Charles Ashbacher,"[8, 12]","After viewing this tape, it is clear that the only thing that kept Douglas MacArthur from being one of the greatest Americans of all time was his belief that he was one of the greatest Americans of all time. His inability to even consider his own infallibility was very close to a fatal flaw. He was the commander of two of the greatest military defeats in the history of U. S. armed forces, the surrender of Bataan and Corregidor in the Philippines and the rout of U. N. forces by the Chinese in the Korean war.This film captures all of that, including his at times absurd pomposity. There is one scene where he is inspecting a military installation and he places his hands on his hips, arches his back and raises a leg. A decidedly non-military pose done solely for the camera. He looks ridiculous. In so many other scenes, it is clear that he is preening for the newsreel cameras, in fact, I cannot recall a single scene of MacArthur that appeared to be spontaneous. The best line about this aspect of MacArthur is from President Dwight Eisenhower, who said, ""I studied dramatics for seven years under MacArthur.""His greatest mistake, which also proved to be his downfall, was his belief that the Chinese would not dare to intervene in the Korean War. Despite unambiguous signals from Mao that the Chinese would enter the war if U. N. forces moved north, MacArthur dismissed them as bluffs. He also failed to appreciate that the Chinese troops were combat veterans, having been at constant war for over a decade. There was really no excuse for such a blunder. However, he compounded that by clumsily trying to blame everyone else for the problem and trying to widen the war. His attempt to include the forces of the Chinese on Taiwan in the Korean War would have risked World War III and was one of the worst ideas of all time. There is also the classic scene where MacArthur met Truman and he failed to salute Truman. This was no accident and could have been nothing other than a deliberate snub on the part of MacArthur. There are two conflicting reports of the conversation between MacArthur and Truman in the car after that. One witness reported that the conversation was amiable and another who said Truman chewed MacArthur out, emphatically reminding him that Truman was the commander-in-chief. As a student of Truman, it is my firm belief that Truman would not have hesitated to yell at MacArthur.It is a tribute to the innate sense of the American electorate that even though MacArthur was given a tremendous hero's welcome when he returned after being fired, it faded quickly. He had no political future and it was clear to the American electorate that a fundamental constitutional principle was at stake. The military is subservient to the elected civilian leadership and MacArthur was a direct threat to that principle. It is a tragedy that he failed to understand that. His inability to understand the broader political risks in Korea led to the Chinese intervention and a far more lengthy and costlier war.However, no comment on MacArthur is complete without mentioning his personal bravery, although it was sometimes foolhardy. After watching this tape, I agree with the assessment that in terms of his surviving World War I, ""He was the luckiest SOB in the whole U. S. army."" He led a patrol where he was the only one that wasn't killed and he personally led charges armed only with a riding crop. These were attacks where approximately one fourth of the attackers were killed.This is a powerful bit of film; I was particularly impressed with the detailed analysis of how well MacArthur handled Japan during the surrender and subsequent occupation. I would have liked to see more analysis of his command of the defense of the Philippines and the battles to retake them. The emphasis in the tape is on his political battles for resources and not on whether his campaign was really a military necessity.  It is still a point of argument whether a concentrated northern island-hopping push through the northern areas of the Pacific was the best way to defeat Japan. I also would have liked to see more analysis of the consequences of his actions in Korea. After a point, the scenes of MacArthur acting for the cameras just grew repetitive.The best description of MacArthur is a quote at the end of the tape. One of his military colleagues is quoted as saying that his greatest flaw was that he truly thought that his own ambitions were fundamental principles and should be national policy.  I consider this tape mandatory viewing for anyone who wants to understand MacArthur, the pacific theatre of World War II, postwar Japan or the war in Korea.",5,Required viewing to understand MacArthur,1103760000,"12 23, 2004",2004,4662,"['viewing', 'tape', 'clear', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'Douglas', 'MacArthur', 'being', 'one', 'greatest', 'Americans', 'time', 'was', 'belief', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'Americans', 'time', 'inability', 'even', 'consider', 'own', 'infallibility', 'was', 'very', 'close', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'was', 'commander', 'two', 'greatest', 'military', 'defeats', 'history', 'U.', 'S.', 'armed', 'forces', 'surrender', 'Bataan', 'Corregidor', 'Philippines', 'rout', 'U.', 'N.', 'forces', 'Chinese', 'Korean', 'war.This', 'film', 'including', 'times', 'absurd', 'pomposity', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'inspecting', 'military', 'installation', 'hands', 'hips', 'back', 'leg', 'decidedly', 'non-military', 'pose', 'done', 'solely', 'camera', 'ridiculous', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'scenes', 'clear', 'preening', 'newsreel', 'cameras', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'single', 'scene', 'MacArthur', 'appeared', 'be', 'spontaneous', 'best', 'line', 'aspect', 'MacArthur', 'President', 'Dwight', 'Eisenhower', 'who', 'said', 'studied', 'dramatics', 'seven', 'years', 'MacArthur', 'greatest', 'mistake', 'also', 'proved', 'be', 'downfall', 'was', 'belief', 'Chinese', 'would', 'not', 'dare', 'intervene', 'Korean', 'War', 'unambiguous', 'signals', 'Mao', 'Chinese', 'would', 'enter', 'war', 'U.', 'N.', 'forces', 'moved', 'north', 'MacArthur', 'dismissed', 'bluffs', 'also', 'failed', 'appreciate', 'Chinese', 'troops', 'were', 'combat', 'veterans', 'having', 'been', 'constant', 'war', 'decade', 'was', 'really', 'excuse', 'blunder', 'However', 'compounded', 'clumsily', 'trying', 'blame', 'everyone', 'else', 'problem', 'trying', 'widen', 'war', 'attempt', 'include', 'forces', 'Chinese', 'Taiwan', 'Korean', 'War', 'would', 'have', 'risked', 'World', 'War', 'III', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'ideas', 'time', 'also', 'classic', 'scene', 'where', 'MacArthur', 'met', 'Truman', 'failed', 'salute', 'Truman', 'was', 'accident', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'nothing', 'other', 'deliberate', 'snub', 'part', 'MacArthur', 'are', 'two', 'conflicting', 'reports', 'conversation', 'MacArthur', 'Truman', 'car', 'One', 'witness', 'reported', 'conversation', 'was', 'amiable', 'who', 'said', 'Truman', 'chewed', 'MacArthur', 'out', 'emphatically', 'reminding', 'Truman', 'was', 'commander-in-chief', 'student', 'Truman', 'firm', 'belief', 'Truman', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'hesitated', 'yell', 'MacArthur.It', 'tribute', 'innate', 'sense', 'American', 'electorate', 'even', 'MacArthur', 'was', 'given', 'tremendous', 'hero', 'welcome', 'when', 'returned', 'being', 'fired', 'faded', 'quickly', 'had', 'political', 'future', 'was', 'clear', 'American', 'electorate', 'fundamental', 'constitutional', 'principle', 'was', 'stake', 'military', 'subservient', 'elected', 'civilian', 'leadership', 'MacArthur', 'was', 'direct', 'threat', 'principle', 'tragedy', 'failed', 'understand', 'inability', 'understand', 'broader', 'political', 'risks', 'Korea', 'led', 'Chinese', 'intervention', 'far', 'more', 'lengthy', 'costlier', 'war.However', 'comment', 'MacArthur', 'complete', 'mentioning', 'personal', 'bravery', 'was', 'sometimes', 'foolhardy', 'watching', 'tape', 'agree', 'assessment', 'terms', 'surviving', 'World', 'War', 'was', 'luckiest', 'SOB', 'whole', 'U.', 'S', 'army', 'led', 'patrol', 'where', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'killed', 'personally', 'led', 'charges', 'armed', 'only', 'riding', 'crop', 'were', 'attacks', 'where', 'approximately', 'one', 'fourth', 'attackers', 'were', 'killed.This', 'powerful', 'bit', 'film', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'detailed', 'analysis', 'how', 'well', 'MacArthur', 'handled', 'Japan', 'surrender', 'subsequent', 'occupation', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'analysis', 'command', 'defense', 'Philippines', 'battles', 'retake', 'emphasis', 'tape', 'political', 'battles', 'resources', 'not', 'campaign', 'was', 'really', 'military', 'necessity', 'still', 'point', 'argument', 'concentrated', 'northern', 'island-hopping', 'push', 'northern', 'areas', 'Pacific', 'was', 'best', 'way', 'defeat', 'Japan', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'analysis', 'consequences', 'actions', 'Korea', 'point', 'scenes', 'MacArthur', 'acting', 'cameras', 'just', 'grew', 'repetitive.The', 'best', 'description', 'MacArthur', 'quote', 'end', 'tape', 'One', 'military', 'colleagues', 'quoted', 'saying', 'greatest', 'flaw', 'was', 'truly', 'thought', 'own', 'ambitions', 'were', 'fundamental', 'principles', 'should', 'be', 'national', 'policy', 'consider', 'tape', 'mandatory', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'who', 'understand', 'MacArthur', 'pacific', 'theatre', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'postwar', 'Japan', 'war', 'Korea']",American Experience - MacArthur
