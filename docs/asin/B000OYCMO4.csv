1067498,A26PEFWHKUHN7O,B000OYCMO4,Captain Insanity,"[3, 6]","In the 1950's 2 American Entomologists (Dr. Raymond Bushland & Dr. Edward Knipling) developed the ""sterile insect technique"",to control the population of the screwworm fly. In this technique the male screwworm flies were exposed to radiation, thus rendering them sterile. They were then returned back to the wild, to mate with other wild female screwworm flies. The result was a reduction in the amount of eggs being laid inside American crops.Now someone or something is applying the same technique to mankind.A new form of sterilization, characterized by sexually driven bloodlusts.At first it appears to be a few random mysoginistic slayings.But as the numbers grow, so does the concern.With the possibility of an epidemic, whole areas are soon quarantined.No women are allowed in for they're own safety.They're being forced to stay away, because women of all ages are being wiped out by  men who seem to believe that what they're doing in natural & rational.In countries around the world it's occuring on such a massive scale, that whole rivers are being damned by the steady influx of bodies.But who is causing this, and why?I watched this episode with my wife, which almost never happens as a result of her being female, and hating horror movies.So, after an unnatural amount of coaxing, I finally got her to sit down and watch one with me.And of course, it was an apocalyptic horror movie concerning the erradication of women.Suffice it to say, she will never be watching another horror movie with me, for as long as we both shall live.Obviously, this movie had a much greater impact on her than it did on me.And rightfully so,I'm not a woman, who in most countries (and maybe even in this one),have to live in fear of men every day.(Hell, in Japan, groping is so bad, women have their own subway cars.)(And let's not even get started on the Middle East)This flick is the cinematic embodiment of every woman's fear.Namely, Men.With all that being said,this film deserved more time to explore it's subject,a bigger budget to employ more extras & horrific scenes,and a much better ending that doesn't blow the whole premise.(Nothing ruins a good horror movie more than a really cheap twist ending.)All in all this was an enjoyable film, that could have been memorable, had it been alotted the time to go the extra mile.As a result, the films story suffered, often taking huge leaps in time, giving it an incomplete feeling.But if you really wind up liking it, I have a suggestion.A better, modern example of ""gendercide"" is depicted in Brian K. Vaughn's monthly comic series, ""Y: The Last Man"". Pick up the trade-paper-backs, you will absolutely not be disappointed.In closing,If you're a horror-buff you'll enjoy this movie for what it is,But do yourself a favor and don't watch it with your female,She won't look at you the same way, for like a week.MORAL OF THE STORY:A world without womenis not a post-apocalyptic world I would want to live in.",4,"Chances are this Flick won't make it to ""Lifetime: Television for Women""",1180828800,"06 3, 2007",2007,2953,"['1950', '2', 'American', 'Entomologists', 'Dr.', 'Raymond', 'Bushland', 'Dr.', 'Edward', 'Knipling', 'developed', 'sterile', 'insect', 'technique', 'control', 'population', 'screwworm', 'fly', 'technique', 'male', 'screwworm', 'flies', 'were', 'exposed', 'radiation', 'thus', 'rendering', 'sterile', 'were', 'then', 'returned', 'back', 'wild', 'mate', 'other', 'wild', 'female', 'screwworm', 'flies', 'result', 'was', 'reduction', 'amount', 'eggs', 'being', 'laid', 'American', 'crops.Now', 'someone', 'something', 'applying', 'same', 'technique', 'mankind.A', 'new', 'form', 'sterilization', 'characterized', 'sexually', 'driven', 'bloodlusts.At', 'first', 'be', 'few', 'random', 'mysoginistic', 'slayings.But', 'numbers', 'grow', 'so', 'concern.With', 'possibility', 'epidemic', 'whole', 'areas', 'are', 'soon', 'quarantined.No', 'women', 'are', 'allowed', ""'re"", 'own', 'safety.They', ""'re"", 'being', 'forced', 'stay', 'away', 'women', 'ages', 'are', 'being', 'wiped', 'out', 'men', 'who', 'seem', 'believe', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'natural', 'rational.In', 'countries', 'world', 'occuring', 'massive', 'scale', 'whole', 'rivers', 'are', 'being', 'damned', 'steady', 'influx', 'bodies.But', 'who', 'causing', 'why', 'watched', 'episode', 'wife', 'almost', 'never', 'result', 'being', 'female', 'hating', 'horror', 'movies.So', 'unnatural', 'amount', 'coaxing', 'finally', 'got', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'one', 'me.And', 'course', 'was', 'apocalyptic', 'horror', 'movie', 'concerning', 'erradication', 'women.Suffice', 'say', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'watching', 'horror', 'movie', 'as', 'long', 'shall', 'live.Obviously', 'movie', 'had', 'much', 'greater', 'impact', 'did', 'me.And', 'rightfully', 'so', ""'m"", 'not', 'woman', 'who', 'most', 'countries', 'maybe', 'even', 'one', 'have', 'live', 'fear', 'men', 'day', 'Hell', 'Japan', 'groping', 'so', 'bad', 'women', 'have', 'own', 'subway', 'cars', 'let', 'not', 'even', 'get', 'started', 'Middle', 'East', 'flick', 'cinematic', 'embodiment', 'woman', 'fear.Namely', 'Men.With', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'deserved', 'more', 'time', 'explore', 'subject', 'bigger', 'budget', 'employ', 'more', 'extras', 'horrific', 'scenes', 'much', 'better', 'ending', ""n't"", 'blow', 'whole', 'premise', 'Nothing', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'more', 'really', 'cheap', 'twist', 'ending', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'memorable', 'had', 'been', 'alotted', 'time', 'go', 'extra', 'mile.As', 'result', 'films', 'story', 'suffered', 'often', 'taking', 'huge', 'leaps', 'time', 'giving', 'incomplete', 'feeling.But', 'really', 'wind', 'up', 'liking', 'have', 'suggestion.A', 'better', 'modern', 'example', 'gendercide', 'depicted', 'Brian', 'K.', 'Vaughn', 'monthly', 'comic', 'series', 'Y', 'Last', 'Man', 'Pick', 'up', 'trade-paper-backs', 'will', 'absolutely', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed.In', 'closing', ""'re"", 'horror-buff', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'what', 'do', 'favor', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'female', 'wo', ""n't"", 'look', 'same', 'way', 'week.MORAL', 'THE', 'STORY', 'world', 'womenis', 'not', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', 'would', 'want', 'live']",Masters of Horror: The Screwfly Solution

(Thus extinction of the human species because then there can be no procreation)...which is exactly it seems what the aliens that are taking over the planet want.Further into the movie it can be construed that all the women are now dead, and the men have now turned to killing male children, and many will not like the ending of the movie due to the viewer just being left hanging in the end.  Others might flog the movie for not being a true HORROR movie...as this film is from the masters of horror series, it is more like a sci-fi thriller.In any case I definitely like this movie, it thinks outside the box, and is a refreshing story prompting me to look further and potentially buying the book that movie is based off of.

1067504,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000OYCMO4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[15, 17]","Joe Dante's ""Homecoming"" for Showtime's ""Masters of Horror"" anthology series was easily the controversial high point of Season One.  Alternately described as ""brilliant"" and ""complete trash,"" there were very few who straddled the middle on this political zombie satire.  Needless to say, this intrigued me to contemplate how Dante would follow up this divisive little tale.  Well, for Season Two, Dante clocks in with ""The Screwfly Solution.""  It certainly has a provocative topic, and is the ultimate battle of the sexes--but I suspect that it is a lot less likely to engender the passionate debate of ""Homecoming.""  That is not a criticism, however, as I think this episode stands as one of the more sophisticated entries we've seen so far!Contemplating the end of the world, ""Screwfly"" offers a new take on the apocalypse genre.  A virus affecting men is discovered where if the man is to become sexually aroused--his feelings end up turning to a murderous rage.  Needless to say, this doesn't bode well for the women of the world--as this rage is directed at them!  While this may, on the surface, seem to be a bit (or a lot) misogynistic--the disease is handled well and its repercussions are real, unpleasant and not taken lightly.  The principles include Jason Priestly and Elliott Gould as researchers trying to combat the virus, but this just may take the ultimate toll on their families.""Screwfly"" may not be scary in the traditional sense if you're looking for quick thrills, but the premise is chilling and disturbing and it leads to appropriate gruesomeness.  The tale is well acted and sometimes harrowing, with an emotional context I haven't found often in the ""Masters of Horror"" series.  In fact, through most of the film, I thought I might be scoring this episode at 5 stars--that's how pleasantly surprised I was by this tale.  The end scenes, however, may be a bit prolonged for some viewers.  That didn't bother me as it brought the real domestic dilemma of this story to the forefront.  But, at the last minute, the film provides us with an unnecessary explanation for the whole catastrophe which was both unnecessary and not worthy of what has preceded it.  This terrific tale went wrong in the end, but that doesn't keep it from being one of the best this show had to offer!

First, I think that this barely makes it into the horror genre; it seems more of a psychological thriller. The second problem is that the ending left me unsatisfied, since I felt it was a poor explanation to the reasons behind the events.On the plus side, the acting was pretty good, especially for a horror production.

I was expecting a horror master not a boredom master. This is not a horror movie people. This is a suspense movie with a who-dunnit type feel to it. This movie has a science fiction ending and the Avatar aliens make an apperance in this film. I know it was probably scary for some but not for a horror fan. If you are a true horror fan this will put you to sleep. If you are not into horror movies and scare easily than this is for you. I'm sorry I expect a horror master to bring on the horror and gore. This movie had Brandon Walsh from 90210 being a killer. I'm sorry Brandon your not scary, bring Dillion he has potential to be scary.

A little sex and nudity, but wasn't a softcore production. It had some mystery and suspense, but not enough to make watching it a chore. It has humor, but wasn't a comedy. The acting was good with another fine performance from Gould. Nothing like a liberal family faced with the final solution and being forced to survive like red necks. Try not to get too attached to any of the main characters as most don't make it through the movie. The line I liked most was when the the teen girl says, ""We should just nuke those f***ing ragheads."" To wit the feminists reply, ""Don't say ragheads."" That one line is what separates real liberals from the rest of the world.",4,A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING,1276819200,"06 18, 2010",2010,727,"['hour', 'long', 'episode', 'had', 'blood', 'was', ""n't"", 'slasher', 'film', 'little', 'sex', 'nudity', 'was', ""n't"", 'softcore', 'production', 'had', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'watching', 'chore', 'humor', 'was', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'fine', 'performance', 'Gould', 'Nothing', 'liberal', 'family', 'faced', 'final', 'solution', 'being', 'forced', 'survive', 'red', 'necks', 'Try', 'not', 'get', 'too', 'attached', 'main', 'characters', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'line', 'liked', 'most', 'was', 'when', 'teen', 'girl', 'should', 'just', 'nuke', 'f***ing', 'ragheads', 'wit', 'feminists', 'reply', 'Do', ""n't"", 'say', 'ragheads', 'one', 'line', 'what', 'real', 'liberals', 'rest', 'world']",Masters of Horror: The Screwfly Solution
