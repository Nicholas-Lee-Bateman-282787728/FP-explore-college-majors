I sent for all three seasons for myself and plan to give Season One as a Christmas stocking stuffer gift to my son.I must be jaded.  I say this because I was constantly caught off-guard by the plot developments in this series.  I loved the loony collection of residents, each with their own foibles, whose antics and idiosyncracies often elicited a guffaw of surprised delight.While it's true there's salty language, and both adult situations and sight-gags, it's somehow not offensive.  While this is not a series a child should view, it's not something a child would be interested in because it's mostly over their heads.I watched Season One with a smile.  Season Two has less of a smile factor, but it's necessary to understand Season Three, whose smile factor is right back up to par with Season One.The real tragedy is that this clever series ended at all.",4,Delightfully Quirky,1253923200,"09 26, 2009",2009,964,"['friend', 'who', 'shares', 'same', 'penchant', 'quirky', 'Canadian', 'videos', 'recommended', 'Robson', 'Arms', 'loved', 'sent', 'three', 'seasons', 'plan', 'give', 'Season', 'One', 'Christmas', 'stocking', 'stuffer', 'gift', 'son.I', 'must', 'be', 'jaded', 'say', 'was', 'constantly', 'caught', 'off-guard', 'plot', 'developments', 'series', 'loved', 'loony', 'collection', 'residents', 'own', 'foibles', 'antics', 'idiosyncracies', 'often', 'elicited', 'guffaw', 'surprised', 'true', 'salty', 'language', 'adult', 'situations', 'sight-gags', 'somehow', 'not', 'offensive', 'not', 'series', 'child', 'should', 'view', 'not', 'something', 'child', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'mostly', 'heads.I', 'watched', 'Season', 'One', 'smile', 'Season', 'Two', 'less', 'smile', 'factor', 'necessary', 'understand', 'Season', 'Three', 'smile', 'factor', 'right', 'back', 'par', 'Season', 'One.The', 'real', 'tragedy', 'clever', 'series', 'ended']",Robson Arms: Season 1

My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I haven't actually watched each episode. If you want something laugh out loud funny, with a sexual twist here and there, give this show a chance!
