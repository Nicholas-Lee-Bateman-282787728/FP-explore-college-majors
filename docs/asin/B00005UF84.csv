However it's close enough considering if you weren't with Disney and if you wanted to tell a ""real"" story the odds were against you.Just ignore those people who cry out against the violence because there is plenty of it in the book and plenty of talking about it too. I just recently read the damn thing before watching the movie so I should know as good as anyone.I can go on and on about how much it ""annoys"" me (though I can think of many other creative words) that everyone expects a g/pg movie that ""the whole family"" can enjoy when it comes to animation. Well I think the whole family can enjoy this movie and if it scares your kids (it kind of freaked me out) then so be it, life can be scary people and animals die everyday get over it.So I say it one more time. Despite what others say this book follows the plot as close as any movie could for when it was made. And that is saying allot since it came out in 1978 and has influenced a number of people since then because this isn't a cute story about some wacky rabbits this a story that can be compared to any story that involves humans as much as any Pixar film.",5,A true classic,1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,1228,"['wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'first', 'say', ""n't"", 'have', 'element', 'book', 'quite', 'few', 'changes', 'However', 'close', 'enough', 'considering', 'were', ""n't"", 'Disney', 'wanted', 'tell', 'real', 'story', 'odds', 'were', 'you.Just', 'ignore', 'people', 'who', 'cry', 'out', 'violence', 'plenty', 'book', 'plenty', 'talking', 'too', 'just', 'recently', 'read', 'damn', 'thing', 'watching', 'movie', 'should', 'know', 'as', 'good', 'anyone.I', 'can', 'go', 'how', 'much', 'annoys', 'can', 'think', 'many', 'other', 'creative', 'words', 'everyone', 'g/pg', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'when', 'animation', 'Well', 'think', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'kids', 'kind', 'freaked', 'then', 'so', 'be', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'scary', 'people', 'animals', 'die', 'everyday', 'get', 'it.So', 'say', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'what', 'others', 'say', 'book', 'plot', 'as', 'close', 'movie', 'could', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'saying', 'allot', 'came', 'out', '1978', 'influenced', 'number', 'people', 'then', ""n't"", 'cute', 'story', 'wacky', 'rabbits', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'story', 'humans', 'as', 'much', 'Pixar', 'film']",N/A

I had someone that I highly respect recommend that I look into this story.  Well, I did and...Summary:A small group of rabbits from the Sandleford Warren follow the prophecies of a young rabbit, Fiver, that their burrow is going to be destroyed and leave the warren even though they are commanded not to by their chief rabbit.  They embark on a long journey with many adventures and eventually end up at Watership Down, discovering their own honeycomb burrows.  Fiver has seemingly seen this burrow in vision and knows that this is where they are supposed to go.But, the group has a problem.  Once they find the perfect burrow (Watership Down) they realize that they didn't bring any does (females).  So, in order to get the does they need they infiltrate a neighboring warren, Efera, that is run like a military camp and eventually sneak the does out.  The captain of the warren sees them and gives chase.  He eventually catches up to them back at their warren and a battle ensues.  The Watership Down warren, with Hazel (Fiver's brother) and Bigwig (their muscle) at the lead, eventually defeat the Efera warren.  The movie ends with Hazel-ra ('ra' is the title they give to their chief rabbit) passing away.My Comments:Most reviews of the movie describe it as not being a kids' movie.  I think that is accurate for children under ten, but children older than ten it should be fine.  What I find more intriguing is that this book is, to many people, the best book ever written.  Now, I'm just reviewing the movie here, but I don't see what is supposed to make this story (book or movie) the most amazing one ever written.I'm thinking people are seeing a lot of symbolism in the story.  Or, perhaps, the book is just really well written and that doesn't come out all that well in the movie.  I have been racking my brain trying to figure out what the movie could symbolize. Of course, there is a lot of religion in the story and with any story that tries to incorporate symbolism you can probably interpret it many ways, but since the person that recommended the story to me is Mormon, let me see if I can find some stories that would mirror the story in the book.You could argue that Fiver could be Lehi and Hazel could be Nephi from The Book of Mormon.  Or perhaps Fiver is Joseph Smith and Hazel is Brigham Young.  I don't see a way to extrapolate this into representing Christ, so I'll have to avoid that one.  Or maybe it has to do with nations and forms of government.  Perhaps Fiver is Columbus and Hazel represents the colonizing of America.  And the Efera group is some type of dictatorship.  Who knows; I just don't think it plays out all that well.Overall, maybe I'm missing something.  I'd be happy to hear what it is I'm missing if someone would like to take the time to explain it to me.  But, until then, I just found this to be a slightly boring, semi-violent cartoon about religion.  Perhaps with further insights offered by someone else (other than 'This is the best book ever') I can offer more to people.  If you want interesting animal books, try Animal Farm by George Orwell.  The symbolism isn't buried so deep you can't understand it and the writing is superb.",2,What's all the fuss?,1043020800,"01 20, 2003",2003,3274,"['must', 'admit', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'supposed', 'make', 'such', 'amazing', 'story', 'had', 'someone', 'highly', 'respect', 'recommend', 'look', 'story', 'Well', 'did', 'Summary', 'small', 'group', 'rabbits', 'Sandleford', 'Warren', 'follow', 'prophecies', 'young', 'rabbit', 'Fiver', 'burrow', 'going', 'be', 'destroyed', 'leave', 'warren', 'even', 'are', 'commanded', 'not', 'chief', 'rabbit', 'embark', 'long', 'journey', 'many', 'adventures', 'eventually', 'end', 'up', 'Watership', 'Down', 'discovering', 'own', 'honeycomb', 'burrows', 'Fiver', 'seemingly', 'seen', 'burrow', 'vision', 'where', 'are', 'supposed', 'go.But', 'group', 'problem', 'find', 'perfect', 'burrow', 'Watership', 'Down', 'realize', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'females', 'So', 'order', 'get', 'need', 'infiltrate', 'neighboring', 'warren', 'Efera', 'run', 'military', 'camp', 'eventually', 'sneak', 'out', 'captain', 'warren', 'chase', 'eventually', 'up', 'back', 'warren', 'battle', 'ensues', 'Watership', 'Down', 'warren', 'Hazel', 'Fiver', 'brother', 'Bigwig', 'muscle', 'lead', 'eventually', 'defeat', 'Efera', 'warren', 'movie', 'Hazel-ra', 'title', 'give', 'chief', 'rabbit', 'passing', 'away.My', 'Comments', 'Most', 'reviews', 'movie', 'not', 'being', 'kids', 'movie', 'think', 'accurate', 'children', 'ten', 'children', 'older', 'ten', 'should', 'be', 'fine', 'What', 'find', 'more', 'intriguing', 'book', 'many', 'people', 'best', 'book', 'ever', 'written', 'Now', ""'m"", 'just', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'supposed', 'make', 'story', 'book', 'movie', 'most', 'amazing', 'one', 'ever', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'people', 'are', 'seeing', 'lot', 'symbolism', 'story', 'perhaps', 'book', 'just', 'really', 'well', 'written', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'well', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'racking', 'brain', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'movie', 'could', 'symbolize', 'course', 'lot', 'religion', 'story', 'story', 'incorporate', 'symbolism', 'can', 'probably', 'interpret', 'many', 'ways', 'person', 'recommended', 'story', 'Mormon', 'let', 'see', 'can', 'find', 'stories', 'would', 'mirror', 'story', 'book.You', 'could', 'argue', 'Fiver', 'could', 'be', 'Lehi', 'Hazel', 'could', 'be', 'Nephi', 'Book', 'Mormon', 'perhaps', 'Fiver', 'Joseph', 'Smith', 'Hazel', 'Brigham', 'Young', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'way', 'extrapolate', 'representing', 'Christ', 'so', ""'ll"", 'have', 'avoid', 'one', 'maybe', 'do', 'nations', 'forms', 'government', 'Perhaps', 'Fiver', 'Columbus', 'Hazel', 'colonizing', 'America', 'Efera', 'group', 'type', 'dictatorship', 'Who', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'out', 'well.Overall', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'missing', 'something', ""'d"", 'be', 'happy', 'hear', 'what', ""'m"", 'missing', 'someone', 'would', 'like', 'take', 'time', 'explain', 'then', 'just', 'found', 'be', 'slightly', 'boring', 'semi-violent', 'cartoon', 'religion', 'Perhaps', 'further', 'insights', 'offered', 'someone', 'else', 'other', ""'This"", 'best', 'book', 'ever', 'can', 'offer', 'more', 'people', 'want', 'interesting', 'animal', 'books', 'try', 'Animal', 'Farm', 'George', 'Orwell', 'symbolism', ""n't"", 'buried', 'so', 'deep', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'writing', 'superb']",N/A

The reviewer was explaining how he/she used to watch this movie when he/she was a kid, and it scared him/her, but at the same time he/she loved it.This is exactly how I felt when I was a young child.This was one of those movies that I always used to rent at the video store.

I actually rented the movie so many times when I was little, that the video store ended up giving it to me...Anyway.If you are one of those parents who doesn't let your kid watch scary movies, I do not recommend this film. But, if you are able to convince your children (as my parents convinced me) that everything they are watching is ""pretend,"" then I definitely do recommend you purchase this movie.

Even after all this time, it is still the very best animated movie I've ever seen (and I've seen alot of them since!) and one of the best movies I've seen in my whole life. I love it because it does not go the ""Disney"" path, as mots modern animated movies go now. One thing I love it is that there's only got one song in it, and unlike Disney movies, the characters don't burst into song every 5 minutes, so making it a marvellous ride from start to finish. When the one song does appear, it appears at the right time and is used in the right scene for the abosutely maximum effect. And animators are not afraid to make animated movies darker and more violent as well, so telling a richer and more relastic view of the world around us. I wish more animated movies did this.And one last thing, ""Bright Eyes"" by Art Garfunkel is one of my all time favorite songs. It is just so sappy and dark. Particually in the spot where it's used. It was only in 2004 that I found a song more sappy and dark than this. And that song came only by pure luck!It's a pity that not many young people today see this stuff now.

The rabbits have realistic structures and move very smoothly almost like a real life rabbit would. The only other movie I've seen besides Plague dogs that come close to this is this old Peter Rabbit movie I loved when I was little and it can't compare to this. The story is very dark which is an added plus because most animated films are often cutesy and carefree, but in this there's always a sense of danger and its unpredictable. Being a Warriors fan I couldn't help but wonder if Erin Hunter found inspiration from this story and put some of that in her books (When Firestar is caught in a fox trap). The end of this movie actually drove me to tears. If you love this then I also recommend Plague Dogs which I believe is even darker.

There is a cartoon coming on and my mother sees that it's going to be about rabbits, harmless rabbits. She goes upstairs to clean or whatever moms do out of sight for hours and make a lot of noise. We all sit there in our bean bags (we all had our own, mine was yellow) and watch the movie.

684166,A29ZCVZWIWZBCH,B00005UF84,Dr Jeremy Buddle,"[10, 10]","I am delighted with the September 2003 release on DVD of the beloved animated feature film Watership Down as a 25th Anniversary special edition. Owning a copy of this movie, which is to me uniquely special, indicated the central role DVD technology has assumed in preserving people's favourite movies for home viewing in a more lasting form than ever before. Only now have I begun to collect movies after many years of avoiding them owing to a concern over the utility, and durability of the decay-prone videotape system. This film, one of the very first I have purchased, has some extras added, the most useful of which is an extensive commentary from director Martin Rosen that covers most aspects of the film's generation and adaptation from Richard Adams's award-winning book. But the film itself is a true classic. I saw it at the cinema in early 1979 aged nine, soon after reading the book (which was a 9th birthday present for me).It made a very strong impression on me, and I found it a beautifully-realised tale that incorporated a mythic prologue that explained the basic workings of rabbit society, a dangerous quest, a very well-defined central cast of rabbit characters- the noble Hazel, the courageous Bigwig, the prophetic Fiver, and the oppressive General Woundwort. There is fear and danger in the rabbits' adventure but also heroism, ingenuity and loyalty, not to mention altruism when the kindly if cantankerous seabird Kehaar (voiced by Zero Mostel) is given shelter by the rabbits and later acts as a scout, helping them hatch a plan to stave off invasion by a ruthless tribe of neighbouring rabbits they come into conflict with. The English countryside is delightfully, and accurately portrayed, and the idea of animated animals enacting a tale that has at its heart the battle to survive in the face of human expansion and ecological destruction works well. The film cannot, in 88 minutes, give too much detail of the several alternative styles of societal organisation (described more fully in the book)that the rabbits encounter on their journey, but nothing crucial to the story is omitted. The other wonderful feature of Watership Down is the original song Bright Eyes, performed by Art Garfunkel. This hauntingly beautiful tune appears in an edited dream sequence in the middle of the film that represents Hazel's rescue after being dangerously hurt. It is my all-time favourite song.This movie is most suited to older children (8-9+)and adults, and will continue to be enjoyed for generations to come.",5,Most wonderful animated tale on film,1082937600,"04 26, 2004",2004,2530,"['am', 'delighted', 'September', '2003', 'release', 'DVD', 'beloved', 'animated', 'feature', 'film', 'Watership', 'Down', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'special', 'edition', 'Owning', 'copy', 'movie', 'uniquely', 'special', 'indicated', 'central', 'role', 'DVD', 'technology', 'assumed', 'preserving', 'people', 'favourite', 'movies', 'home', 'viewing', 'more', 'lasting', 'form', 'ever', 'Only', 'now', 'have', 'begun', 'collect', 'movies', 'many', 'years', 'avoiding', 'owing', 'concern', 'utility', 'durability', 'decay-prone', 'videotape', 'system', 'film', 'one', 'very', 'first', 'have', 'purchased', 'extras', 'added', 'most', 'useful', 'extensive', 'commentary', 'director', 'Martin', 'Rosen', 'most', 'aspects', 'film', 'generation', 'adaptation', 'Richard', 'Adams', 'award-winning', 'book', 'film', 'true', 'classic', 'saw', 'cinema', 'early', '1979', 'aged', 'nine', 'soon', 'reading', 'book', 'was', '9th', 'birthday', 'present', '.It', 'made', 'very', 'strong', 'impression', 'found', 'beautifully-realised', 'tale', 'incorporated', 'mythic', 'prologue', 'explained', 'basic', 'workings', 'rabbit', 'society', 'dangerous', 'quest', 'very', 'well-defined', 'central', 'cast', 'rabbit', 'characters-', 'noble', 'Hazel', 'courageous', 'Bigwig', 'prophetic', 'Fiver', 'oppressive', 'General', 'Woundwort', 'fear', 'danger', 'rabbits', 'adventure', 'also', 'heroism', 'ingenuity', 'loyalty', 'not', 'mention', 'altruism', 'when', 'kindly', 'cantankerous', 'seabird', 'Kehaar', 'voiced', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'given', 'shelter', 'rabbits', 'later', 'acts', 'scout', 'helping', 'hatch', 'plan', 'stave', 'off', 'invasion', 'ruthless', 'tribe', 'neighbouring', 'rabbits', 'come', 'conflict', 'English', 'countryside', 'delightfully', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'idea', 'animated', 'animals', 'enacting', 'tale', 'heart', 'battle', 'survive', 'face', 'human', 'expansion', 'ecological', 'destruction', 'well', 'film', 'can', 'not', '88', 'minutes', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'several', 'alternative', 'styles', 'societal', 'organisation', 'described', 'more', 'fully', 'book', 'rabbits', 'encounter', 'journey', 'nothing', 'crucial', 'story', 'omitted', 'other', 'wonderful', 'feature', 'Watership', 'Down', 'original', 'song', 'Bright', 'Eyes', 'performed', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'tune', 'edited', 'dream', 'sequence', 'middle', 'film', 'Hazel', 'rescue', 'being', 'dangerously', 'hurt', 'all-time', 'favourite', 'song.This', 'movie', 'most', 'suited', 'older', 'children', '8-9+', 'adults', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'generations', 'come']",N/A

It is a brutally realistic look at how rabbits live with the threats of their thousand predators, other warrens, and above all man.From top to bottom, the vocal casting is wonderful.  John Hurt is a commanding, heroic Hazel - but it's Richard Briers' Fiver who really runs away with the movie.  Perfectly registering bemused apprehension, quiet despair, utter fear and sometimes even helpless rage, he absolutely steals - and breaks - your heart.The animation itself is more mixed.  The three different styles - one for the main story, one for the rabbit legends in the prologue, and a third for Fiver's visions - don't always connect smoothly and are sometimes of varying quality.  But, generally speaking, the English countryside background is beautiful, the violence suitably horrific (especially the confirmation by a survivor of the holocaust that Fiver predicted) and the animation of the rabbits admirably unique and individual.The story remains quite faithful - often taking from the novel verbatim.  The scene that has the most impact is probably the one based on the chapter ""Fiver Beyond"", with Art Garfunkel singing Fiver's thoughts as he searches for a seriously wounded Hazel after everyone else has given his brother up for dead.  I hesitate to discuss omissions for fear of giving things away to people who haven't read the book, so suffice it to say that almost all the important plots and scenes are intact.

'Animal Farm' is NOT an animal book (I can't believe I'm having to explain this...); it's a book about socialism and fascism. 'Watership Down' is a book about rabbits. True, there are some references to the evils of fascism, but if you want to pick out a message, it's obviously the spoilation of the planet and the destruction of its wildlife by humankind. Yes, there are mystical overtones, but it's definitely NOT about religion.2. I seriously hope the person who wrote 'if you want good drama watch a soap opera' was being ironic, but I have my doubts...In short: this film is a pretty good effort at adapting an extremely difficult novel. Much has been lost, of course, but few of us would pay to see a three-hour animated film about rabbits. Martin Rosen and his team follow Richard Adams's lead in not shying away from showing us the violent side of the rabbits' lives. Children are likely to enjoy the film, but bear in mind it contains unpleasant moments. However, I think these are more likely to encourage sympathy, compassion and respect for the natural world than do any harm ( although many children and quite a few adults may shed tears before the end). Please make sure you read the book, too - it's superb. And look out for the animated version of Adams's 'The Plague Dogs'... although that really IS dark and distressing. I'm a big fan of Disney's work, but I'm still glad they didn't produce this adaptation ( as was originally intended) because I'm sure they would have softened the story's harsher elements.

I was prepared to watch a children's movie and was struck by the seriousness of the subject and the realistic scenes.The film begins with the mythology of the rabbit which is rather odd but in a cute way.  This introduction foreshadows the hardships and enemies the rabbit species will face.  From there the story seems to touch on at least two issues: fascism/Marxism and environmentalism. The latter is only briefly touched on.  The small rabbit Fiver, who has unexplained powers to foresee the future, urges a group of fellow rabbits in his ""warren"" to leave before their land is destroyed by some destructive force.  Actually, it is man who tears up their fields, but it is only described briefly by a survivor.  In their journey to the safe mountain top (utopia?), they encounter several enemies and a funny bird friend (my favorite of the characters).  Once they reach their destination, they realize that they have no females in their group (the only ""doe"" having been killed) and must return to dangerous territory to acquire mates.  Their worst enemy, ironically, is a member of their own species; a fascist rabbit who threatens to have any dissenter from his warren killed.  Also, ironically, inventions of man (i.e. a boat) are used by the rabbits in their struggle to survive. A musical segment with music sung by Art Garfunkel interrupts the fairly fast-moving story.The violence in this film is surprisingly realistic and graphic. Some rabbits do not make it, so very young children may need to be prepared before watching.  I also looked at a VHS copy of this film, and DVD is far superior in terms of graphics and color.  The extras on this DVD were a little disappointing considering that this film is a classic (i.e. a glossary of rabbit words that is not even complete).

BIGWIG), the near perfect artwork, and the themes which attract a variety of audience.",5,animation classic #1,1126137600,"09 8, 2005",2005,546,"['nothing', 'good', 'dramatic', 'cartoon', '5', 'year', 'old', 'remembered', 'watching', 'rabbit', 'cartoon', 'over', 'again', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', '13', 'years', 'later', 'rediscovered', 'film', 'title', 'anf', 'brought', 'DVD', 'was', 'shocked', 'see', 'how', 'old', 'was', '27', 'years', 'Nevertheless', 'still', 'find', 'very', 'charming', 'scary', 'good', 'Probably', 'factors', 'make', 'film', 'outstanding', 'are', 'excellent', 'choice', 'British', 'accents', 'esp', 'BIGWIG', 'near', 'perfect', 'artwork', 'themes', 'attract', 'variety', 'audience']",N/A

In fact, childhood is probably the best time to see this movie-- its flaws will not be so apparent and its poetry and brutality will be at their most effective.  It's exactly the sort of movie you love when you're seven, hope for years you'll get to see again, and rediscover in your late twenties with a mix of disappointment and elation.  The film, eccentrically animated and rather well voiced, suffers from a lack of exposition and the nagging sense that something important has been left out of nearly every scene-- and I can't be alone in finding Zero Mostel's Kehaar obnoxious and overdone (kids will probably find him funny, and do imitations of him while jumping off the living-room couch)-- but the story is exciting and full of shadow, the violence is neither whitewashed nor excessive, and where Disney, for example, would have yielded to the temptation to tack on a happy ending, Watership Down takes its heroes seriously enough to allow them the consequences of mortality.

And the story centers around a particulr group of rabbits who struggle through death, persection, and misery to find a place where they can live in peace.

If you are one of those who must buy this DVD, by all means don't let me stop you.  But may I offer a few caveats for the rest of us?The main problem with this film (as with the book) is that it doesn't know whether it's a beast fable or an attempt at realistic depictions of nature.  With such a profound identity crisis on the story level, it's no surprise that the animation veers unevenly between caricature and photorealism.  Parents take note: This film is too grisly for children _and_ too cutesy for adults.The first half of _Watership Down_ is a road movie, and a frequently entertaining one at that.  But the second half, when the story becomes a simplistic political allegory, falls apart.  Director Martin Rosen doesn't have a tight grasp of the material; apparently, Rosen replaced animation great John Hubley early in the production, and is responsible for everything but the prologue.  A few years later Rosen would fare better with the far superior but little-seen _Plague Dogs_ (available in truncated form on a bare-bones DVD).Despite the film's many shortcomings, animation buffs like me will find _Watership Down_ worth a rental, if only for John Hubley's remarkable prologue.  In an avant-garde departure from traditional animation, Hubley uses Haida-influenced artwork to tell a myth on the origin of rabbits.  Although this particular set piece has no relevance to the rest of the film, it's a classic bit of animation in its own right.  It also leaves you to wonder what might have happened had Hubley supervised the entire film.",2,For fans only,1016150400,"03 15, 2002",2002,1653,"['fans', '_Watership', 'Down_', 'opportunity', 'see', 'film', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'good', 'pass', 'up', 'are', 'one', 'who', 'must', 'buy', 'DVD', 'means', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'may', 'offer', 'few', 'caveats', 'rest', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'book', ""n't"", 'know', 'beast', 'fable', 'attempt', 'realistic', 'depictions', 'nature', 'profound', 'identity', 'crisis', 'story', 'level', 'surprise', 'animation', 'veers', 'unevenly', 'caricature', 'photorealism', 'Parents', 'take', 'note', 'film', 'too', 'grisly', 'children', '_and_', 'too', 'adults.The', 'first', 'half', '_Watership', 'Down_', 'road', 'movie', 'frequently', 'entertaining', 'one', 'second', 'half', 'when', 'story', 'simplistic', 'political', 'allegory', 'apart', 'Director', 'Martin', 'Rosen', ""n't"", 'have', 'tight', 'grasp', 'material', 'apparently', 'Rosen', 'replaced', 'animation', 'great', 'John', 'Hubley', 'early', 'production', 'responsible', 'everything', 'prologue', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Rosen', 'would', 'fare', 'better', 'far', 'superior', 'little-seen', '_Plague', 'Dogs_', 'available', 'truncated', 'form', 'bare-bones', 'DVD', '.Despite', 'film', 'many', 'shortcomings', 'animation', 'buffs', 'will', 'find', '_Watership', 'Down_', 'rental', 'only', 'John', 'Hubley', 'remarkable', 'prologue', 'avant-garde', 'departure', 'traditional', 'animation', 'Hubley', 'Haida-influenced', 'artwork', 'tell', 'myth', 'origin', 'rabbits', 'particular', 'set', 'piece', 'relevance', 'rest', 'film', 'classic', 'bit', 'animation', 'own', 'right', 'also', 'wonder', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'had', 'Hubley', 'supervised', 'entire', 'film']",N/A

It's not as good as the same team's subsequent much-vilified box-office disaster The Plague Dogs (only available in the cut US version on DVD outside Australia), but it's importance as a major step away from safe and friendly children's fare in animation can't be underestimated: in many ways, this is an adult drama that just happens to be about rabbits and just happens to be animated rather than an animated film per se.That's not to say there aren't some striking moments of pure visual imagination, from the early rabbit version of the Creation myth to the nightmarish gassing and destruction of the warren, but this is a film where sudden death is a constant companion and survival is a tough business and an unlikely prospect - even the Bright Eyes moment accompanies a character pursued by death.
