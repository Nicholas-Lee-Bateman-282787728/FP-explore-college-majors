1271140,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B002JCSWV6,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[2, 2]","In one sense, this movie adheres to all the well-established rules of the inspirational sports movie. An underdog team is inspired by a wise leader and overcomes the odds to win the championship. But the performance of Mrgan Freeman, who embodies the noble character of Nelson Mandela, elevates this film to a higher level.Mandela is of course the outstanding moral leader of our times. Freeman brings him vibrantly to life. None of the other characters, including Matt Damon as the captain of the South African rugby team, achieves much depth. This movie is all about Freeman and Mandela.Released from 27 years in prison, Mandela is elected the first president of the post apartheid South Africa -- but his nation is badly riven by hatred and inequality. He must find ways of getting beyond the past and moving forward. (Pity he was succeeded by Mbeki, a moral pygmy compared to Mandela, who denied the existence of HIV and did immense damage to his country.)Rugby is the game of the white minority while the black majority plays soccer and despises rugby as the game of the oppressor. South Africa is hosting the World Cup of rugby in 1995 with a team that is all white with the exception of one black player. But Mandela sees the tournament as an opportunity to rally the entire nation behind the team and finds an ally is Francois Pienaar, the captain who has a surprisingly open mind.There are some subplots, not very much developed. Mandela has to integrate his staff, including his security detail, which means finding a way for blacks and their former oppressors to work together.Another false note is the sappy song, ""Colorblind"" inserted midway through the movie.When we get to the actual games, the movie reverts to type. We hear a lot of grunting and thudding collisions of large men. The action seems slow and plodding compared to an actual rugby match.The movie's title comes from a Victorian poem which Freeman mumbles, sotto voce. I wish we could have heard it properly. Also, I wish the DVD had included some extras that could have included interviews with the real-life Pienaar and background about the events depicted in the movie. But there were no extras at all.Having said that, this is a rousing and enjoyable movie. Sport can be incredibly powerful in inspiring a nation -- but the inspiration and good feelings created by victories on the sport field tend not to be very longlasting. After the party is over, the real problems remain.",4,Inspirational movie that transcends the cliches,1277510400,"06 26, 2010",2010,2459,"['one', 'sense', 'movie', 'all', 'well-established', 'rules', 'inspirational', 'sports', 'movie', 'underdog', 'team', 'inspired', 'wise', 'leader', 'odds', 'win', 'championship', 'performance', 'Mrgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'noble', 'character', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'film', 'higher', 'level.Mandela', 'course', 'outstanding', 'moral', 'leader', 'times', 'Freeman', 'vibrantly', 'life', 'None', 'other', 'characters', 'including', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'captain', 'South', 'African', 'rugby', 'team', 'much', 'depth', 'movie', 'Freeman', 'Mandela.Released', '27', 'years', 'prison', 'Mandela', 'elected', 'first', 'president', 'post', 'apartheid', 'South', 'Africa', 'nation', 'badly', 'riven', 'hatred', 'inequality', 'must', 'find', 'ways', 'getting', 'past', 'moving', 'forward', 'Pity', 'was', 'succeeded', 'Mbeki', 'moral', 'pygmy', 'compared', 'Mandela', 'who', 'denied', 'existence', 'HIV', 'did', 'immense', 'damage', 'country', 'Rugby', 'game', 'white', 'minority', 'black', 'majority', 'soccer', 'rugby', 'game', 'oppressor', 'South', 'Africa', 'hosting', 'World', 'Cup', 'rugby', '1995', 'team', 'white', 'exception', 'one', 'black', 'player', 'Mandela', 'tournament', 'opportunity', 'rally', 'entire', 'nation', 'team', 'ally', 'Francois', 'Pienaar', 'captain', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'open', 'mind.There', 'are', 'subplots', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'developed', 'Mandela', 'integrate', 'staff', 'including', 'security', 'detail', 'finding', 'way', 'blacks', 'former', 'oppressors', 'work', 'together.Another', 'false', 'note', 'sappy', 'song', 'Colorblind', 'inserted', 'midway', 'movie.When', 'get', 'actual', 'games', 'movie', 'type', 'hear', 'lot', 'grunting', 'thudding', 'collisions', 'large', 'men', 'action', 'slow', 'plodding', 'compared', 'actual', 'rugby', 'match.The', 'movie', 'title', 'Victorian', 'poem', 'Freeman', 'sotto', 'voce', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'heard', 'properly', 'Also', 'wish', 'DVD', 'had', 'included', 'extras', 'could', 'have', 'included', 'interviews', 'real-life', 'Pienaar', 'background', 'events', 'depicted', 'movie', 'were', 'extras', 'all.Having', 'said', 'rousing', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'Sport', 'can', 'be', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'inspiring', 'nation', 'inspiration', 'good', 'feelings', 'created', 'victories', 'sport', 'field', 'tend', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'longlasting', 'party', 'real', 'problems', 'remain']",N/A

I'm going to to give it 4 out of 5 stars. Worth renting and I am planning on buying it. Clint Eastwood directs Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon in this South African sports thriller. Nelson Mandela (played by Freeman) becomes President of a post-civil war South Africa and gambles his political career on the South African Rugby Team, Captained by Francois Pienaar (played by Damon). Madela is the protagonist and leads an awesome band of actors and actresses. The spectacle of the movie comes at perfect times during the rugby matches. Mandela is faced with the problem of uniting a country and faces it head on. The title, Invictus, is a short Victorian poem by the English poet William Ernest Henley. The poem was Mandela's inspiration while in prison for twenty seven years. Pienaar plays a great sidekick to Manedla, he becomes inspired by Mandela's unconditional faith in the team to win the world cup.

This is not the case with ""Invictus"".  Clint Eastwood as director and producer has crafted a wonderful and moving tale.  It deserves a wide audience.The sport of Rugby Union is little known in America but the use of big name stars such as Morgan Freeman playing Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon playing the South African captain Francois Pienaar works well.  They were both truly convincing.  Damon in particular seemed to master the Afrikaans accent.""Invictus"" is touching.  I frequently found myself almost moved to tears.  The story of how Mandela was able to look beyond simple revenge and move forward in the spirit of reconciliation was uplifting.  If only other nations could follow this example.  Mandela had much to be bitter about but proved that he was a bigger man.  In this way, he further condemned apartheid to the dustbin of history where it belongs.Many people will know the story of the 1995 World Cup.  South Africa as the host nation rose from the ranks of relative easy beats to become champions.  However, in Clint Eastwood's hands we are provided with more than a simple tale of underdog victory.  This is a very tired story.  Instead, Eastwood homes in on both the bigger picture and the touching interplay between Mandela and Pienaar.  Eastwood is getting better with age.  When most men are in retirement at his age, he continues to dazzle.  He is an inspiration himself.Go see this film.

It is the story of Nelson Mandela's attempt to unite his country just after the end of apartheid and at the beginning of his presidency. He sees an opportunity to use sports to rally his country behind one common goal: rugby. He recruits the captain of South Africa's rugby team to not only win the world cup competition but unite the color schism  within the country.I really enjoyed this film however, the characters/story were not as developed as one might have hoped. The story eludes to family troubles for Mandela but does not really develop it. He is seen having an argument with his daughter and is shown to become agitated when asked about his family. As this is a true story, there may not have been a resolution to his family troubles but it left me wondering why Eastwood even bothered including it in the film. The references to it were so cursory that it would seem as though the film would have been fine without it. Likewise, the black population's shift to supporting the South African rugby team seemed too easy-- formerly, blacks would root against them. A black local government even voted to change the name and colors of the team until Mandela stopped them.  It just seemed as though approval of the rugby team seemed to shift over night without any justifiable reason for occurring or at least viewable softening towards them.The two main actors do a wonderful job in their roles. Damon, who usually comes off as very intelligent in interviews, was able to seem simple yet noble in this role and Freeman, who is no stranger to playing a Black South African (the power of one), gracefully conveys the strength of a man who can forgive despite the immense cruelty.This film is definitely worth watching.

Inspirational characters, an uplifting story and a nation united.One would have thought a director like Clint Eastwood would have had a field day with it. Instead he plays it super-safe and draws from every known sports movie cliche out there. Would it have been to difficult to find two South African actors who can play the lead roles? This is not to say Freeman and Damon are not good in the movie. Damon in particular is wonderful.That being said, the movie stumbles around too much to build any kind of intensity. That is a pity given the inspiration nature of the story. Too often we come across movies which fail because of a bad or non-existent story line.

In 1995, they won the World Cup.OK, so I don't normally pay much attention to sports movies. But I love both principal actors, and Mandela is one of my heroes. So I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did.Apparently rugby is sort of like American football without all the padding. All I knew of it before this was that when I was at the University of Michigan, the rugby team was the toughest bunch of SOBs I'd ever met. They were all human bulldogs. Now I know that they had to be to play the game, let alone win it.Before the end of apartheid, South African blacks were in the habit of rooting for any team that played against the Springboks, the all-white South African team. By 1994, they had exactly one black player. Mandela realized that putting the country together was going to take more than laws prohibiting discrimination. It was going to take people coming together willingly. He correctly realized that a winning rugby team could do that.The black kids mostly played soccer (called ""football"" outside of America), partly because the Springboks were so hated. But at Mandela's suggestion, Pienaar took the team on good will tours to the small towns and taught the kids to play rugby. They loved it, and started cheering for the Springboks when they started winning big.The movie does not make it clear exactly what made the Bokke turn into such a good team from what had been a rather pathetic one, except to suggest that Pienaar drove them harder than they'd been driven before. But he had been captain through their ho-hum years, so that's not a very satisfying explanation.The final game, which was against New Zealand, could make a rugby fan out of anyone, even me. It was an amazing game in several respects, and Clint Eastwood is just the director to make it comprehensible. Several of the decisive plays are done in slow motion, which I suppose makes up for the TV instant replay habit.Before the game, the New Zealand team does a Maori war dance, which is every bit as intimidating as they intend it to be. But it is rather odd to see what are clearly white players (although their biggest and meanest looks like a native) doing a chant and coordinated dance.I enjoyed the movie, for all its flaws, and would certainly recommend it to anyone who is generally a sports fan. Even if you're not, you may surprise yourself.P.S. The title of the movie is the title of a poem I memorized in sixth grade. We were each told to choose one to memorize, and I chose this strong-minded one to try to improve my courage. Did it work?

It's an important historical story for South Africa and the world. And yet in the hands of gifted director Clint Eastwood, I just didn't feel that importance in this movie. I wanted to get those same feelings that great sports movies like Hoosiers (1986), Rudy (1993), and The Blind Side (2009) convey. But something was missing from this effort. You could argue that Invictus isn't really a sports movie and that it's a character story about Nelson Mandela. But if it's not a sports movie, then what is it? Because its got an awful lot of sports in it. Maybe that's the whole problem with this film...it just doesn't know what it is. Sometimes that works for a movie, but not this one. I give it 3 stars out of 5.There is some filmmaking craftsmanship in Invictus that we see in the production design, cinematography, and acting for this film. Although the cinematography seems a bit underwelming compared to Eastwood's other films of the past decade. What I think this film is mainly lacking is direction and story/plot. I never felt like the movie was really going anywhere other than where I knew it was going...a big win on the rugby field. But that wasn't enough to give me the payoff I was looking for. And while Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon try to convey aspects of who their characters are, I just didn't connect with either character. They felt too forced. I did think Morgan Freeman was completely believable as Nelson Mandela, but I didn't care enough for his cause. Maybe I needed to understand more of the pain and experience of his imprisonment and the country's racism to feel passionately about what he was up to as President? I'm not totally sure what more could be done with this story. I just know that it didn't connect with me like I hoped for. But the film is worth watching at home on DVD/Bluray or on one of the premium movie channels where I saw it recently.

Martin,"[5, 5]","Clint Eastwood's latest film may be set against the backdrop of a post apartheid South Africa, but above all else it is a testament to the power of sports to bring people together and provide something to believe in.  In tis sense, it is one of the director's simplest works to date.  But that doesn't mean that it isn't a stirring film that offers much to think about.Invictus follows Nelson Mandella after his election as South Africa's president at the end of apartheid and his struggle to unite his country.  He finds his opportunity with the nation's rugy team; a group of mostly white players that have been exhibiting poor play and are on the verge of being disbanded by the nation's non-white majority who view them as a reminder of the oppression that they endured for nearly 50 years.  Mandella speaks up for the maligned group suggesting that keeping them intact would serve as a gesture of peace and forgiveness to the country's white minority who have lost their power and may fear reprisal.Mandella also reaches out to the captain of the rugby team (a beefed up Matt Damon) and encourages him to inspire his teammates to be more than they think are capable of.  Without saying so, he asks the team to win the 1995 world cup.  His hope is that his racially divided nation will come together to support a team that represents them all, not just the white minority.And so the movie follows the team as they undertake their overwhelming task of winning the world cup. They also take on the role of ambassadors to the angry and povery stricken citizens by traveling to the slums and teaching the game to children.  Since the story that the movie is based on is true, there is no need to bring cheap sentiment or melodramatic sub plots into the picutre.  Eastwood simply lets the story tell itself with predictable yet uplifting results.The performances are strong everywhere.  Morgan Freeman is the epitome of grace under pressure as Mandella and Matt Damon nicely captures the mixed emotions of a man who is put in the difficult position of inspiring his teammantes  and serving as a bridge between the nation's racial divide.  It is naive, of course, to believe that the team's improbable run and victory solved the nation's problems, or that Mandella was as infalible and saintly as he is portrayed here.  But it is easy to believe that for a brief time, a nation stood together and supported their rag-tag rugby team as they made everyone forget about the ever present problems that were continuing to rip them apart.  That is the ultimate power of sports; to provide something to believe in, even if for a brief period of time.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 1]","It matters not how strait the gate,How charged with punishments the scroll,I am the master of my fate,I am the captain of my soul.These words, this verse of the poem by William Ernest Hensley in 1875, was the mantra of Nelson Mandela during his imprisonment in South Africa. He refused to give in to hate. He refused to give in to revenge. But how do you pull along an entire country with you? Especially a country as racially divisive as South Africa where Apartheid was a part of the landscape and politics for nearly 50 years?Risking everything, Mandela achieved greatness by focusing not on politics, but on a sport: Rugby. Wanting to win the World Cup and thus unite a country, Mandela (played superbly by Morgan Freman,Wanted) sets out not to divide and conquer, but to unite and calm the racial tensions raging through his beloved South Africa.With him, Mandela must convince Rugby captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon,The Departed) that their poorly performing team can do the impossible: win the World Cup.As most of us now know, that is precisely what happens, and South Africa, for a while, forgets her bloody black-and-white past and turns everyone flush with excitement for simply being South African.Clint Eastwood has proven in his waning years that he should remain (mostly) behind the camera and not in front of it. With the exception ofGran Torino, I've not been much of a fan of his as of late. However, when it comes to his directing chops, I've been fairly well pleased. Probably my favorite acted/directed Clint film would be the lesser knownHeartbreak Ridge. But that might just be me.Many have already said that this was ""the role Morgan Freeman was meant to play,"" and I won't contradict that. He was completely believable as Mandela, getting the look, verbal cadence and movements of The Great Man down perfectly.Matt Damon on the other hand ...didn't really strike me as the bullish and larger-than-life Francois. Although I think he did ""okay."" I believe that a search for a more stylized actor could've easily resulted in a match more adequate to the part.Regardless, the filming is enthralling because of Freeman's performance and the fact-based situations that this movie is based upon. For those looking for a sports film in-line withHoosiers,RockyorRudy, you might want to look elsewhere.

It captured a nation on the precipice of historic social and political reform.What disappointed me a little was Clint Eastwood's direction. Normally, I like most of Clint Eastwood's directorial efforts.  Here, though, he fell short of capturing the drama, the tension and the excitement of the Rugby World Cup which helped to unite a divided nation.  The matches up to the final were shown very cursory almost as an afterthought without taking time to build to any critically tense moments.  The excitement of the decisive match was somewhat muted and almost polite.  The scenes of fans cheering at home and in bars seemed tempered and did not make you want to jump out of your chair to cheer with them.  Perhaps sporting events are not Clint Eastwood's forte.

I wanted so badly to like it, but it was only okay.The movie opens with some sensationally remade news footage of Nelson Mandela (with Morgan Freeman inserted) to provide backstory. Mandela takes over the presidency of a very divided South Africa, and he tries to unite the country around its rugby team. As the story begins, the white fans cheer for the Springboks, while the black fans cheer against them, no matter what team they're playing. Matt Damon plays the rugby team captain, Francois Pienaar.The good: The acting was good, and at times great. Morgan Freeman completely captured Nelson Mandela's frailty and disposition. Matt Damon was good, although I didn't think he had too much to do. The two stars of this movie for me, however, were two supporting actresses, Leleti Khumalo and Sibongile Nojila. The women both played small roles; Khumalo worked for Mandela and Nojila was the Pienaar's maid. In the hands of other actresses, perhaps I wouldn't even have noticed them, but stealing a movie from Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon is quite a feat, and I hope other take note. On the visual side, Eastwood never disappoints with aerial shots. There were quite a few breathtaking views, but otherwise, the movie was nowhere near his other works, especially the visually stunning Changeling (one of 2008's best movies, in my opinion).The not so good: This movie falls somewhere between a sports movie and a political movie, and for me, it failed at both. I admit, I know little to nothing about rugby. The climactic sports scene (it's hardly a spoiler, you know there will be one) was dull. I didn't understand how points were scored, how insurmountable leads are, or what the time on the clock was counting up or down to, and thus, I wasn't especially invested in the action. I knew the outcome, but good sports movies excel at providing an amazing, emotional magical journey. This film lacked magic. Not only did I not cry, I didn't even get goosebumps. I should be the target audience for this film; I adore sports movies, and I enjoy political movies. I like the actors in it. It certainly wasn't bad, but it simply didn't grab me. At the end, all I could say was eh. I didn't like it; I didn't dislike it.

1271171,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002JCSWV6,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 3]","I suppose a film about Nelson Mandela and his attempts to reunify South Africa is expected to include a number of unsubtle and unoriginal racial themes, namely the literal and symbolic divisions between blacks and whites. ""Invictus"" is such a film. Consider a brief but effective shot in which we see Mandela standing in front of his bathroom mirror, getting ready to shave; the entire bottom half of his face is coated in white shaving cream while the top half is uncovered. Also consider the opening scene, which takes place on February 11, 1990, the date Mandela was released from prison; two soccer fields are separated by a road, and one of them is bright green and populated by affluent white kids while the other is patchy, brown, and populated by poor black kids. There are also many shots of white rooms with dark furniture, which may or may not symbolize Mandela's hope for a peaceful coexistence.While nowhere near as compelling as his 2008 masterpieces ""Changeling"" and ""Gran Torino,"" ""Invictus"" is still a fine example of Eastwood's affinity for strong stories with equally strong characters, who in this case are drawn from actual historical figures. He relies once again on Morgan Freeman, and while that may seem like a clich&eacute; casting choice, there's no denying that he was the perfect person to portray Mandela; he not only looks the part, he flawlessly captures his distinct voice and style of delivery. Have you ever heard him speak? He can almost always get a point across, not through actions but simply through deliberate speaking, as if to suggest that serious thought must go into every word before opening your mouth. Listen to one of his speeches on YouTube and you'll know what I'm talking about.The film focuses on one of Mandela's more unorthodox strategies for rebuilding a peaceful and democratic South Africa: Getting the people to support their national Rugby team, the Springboks, before playing in the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Up until then, the Springboks were unanimously hated, mostly because they continued to wear jerseys of green and gold, the colors of apartheid. Many people wanted not only to change the jersey colors, but also to change the name of the team. Mandela, in a move initially resisted, urged his people to leave the name and the colors unchanged, believing that an overhaul of this sort would separate the black and white populations even further. This isn't about petty revenge, he assures, but about moving forward. ""This Rugby,"" his personal assistant asks, ""as a political calculation?"" Mandela asserts, ""It is a human calculation.""As part of this act of social reform, Mandela personally appeals to the captain of the Springboks, Francois Piennar (Matt Damon), who initially seems cool on the whole race issue until he's shown the prison cell Mandela was locked in; cramped and lacking both a decent view and a basic bed, he stands there envisioning Mandela's harsh living conditions and has his quiet yet powerful transformative moment: ""I was thinking how a man could spend thirty years in prison and come out and forgive the men who did it to him."" Indeed, Mandela practices forgiveness at its highest level, almost to the point where you're not sure he's in touch with reality. Most of us, I suspect, will probably never understand or even want to understand what he went through.All of this is well done. Still, one can't help but be somewhat critical of the film's formulaic structure, where overt political and social commentaries are abundant and in service of the final match between the Springboks and the New Zealand All Blacks, a team so fierce no other Rugby-playing country has ever been able to defeat them. If you know your history, you already know who wins the game. Even if you don't know your history, the outcome isn't too far removed from those seen in your average inspirational sports movies. Was there no way for Eastwood and writer Anthony Peckham to go for something subtler? It's hard to say, but I'd wager that much of this material has been dramatized for the sake of appealing to the movie masses.Still, you have to give everyone involved credit for crafting an entertaining drama. And I admit that obvious representations of racial prejudice are more effective than metaphors, like those seen in the well intentioned but unsuccessful science fiction fable ""District 9."" What we get from ""Invictus"" is no more or less than a feel-good story, which I know is something we all want to see from time to time. It helps that the characters are strong and the performances are good; one of Eastwood's strengths as a director is his ability to emotionally develop the key figures of a story, which could not be done without capable actors like Freeman and Damon. So no, this movie doesn't reach the same level of excellence as ""Changeling"" or ""Gran Torino."" But at least it gets the job done, and for that, I'm grateful.",4,A Country United by a Love of the Game,1260489600,"12 11, 2009",2009,4910,"['suppose', 'film', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'attempts',

After years of post-WWII enforced racial segregation (known as apartheid), South Africa finally bowed to international and internal pressures and abolished the apartheid laws, granting universal suffrage that resulted in the election of South Africa's first black president by a wide majority.  President Mandela, admirably non-vindictive in spite of his lengthy punishment by the apartheid state,  feared for ongoing inter-racial friction, and befriended the (mostly white) national rugby team, the Springboks, and particularly its captain Franois Pienaar (splendidly portrayed by Matt Damon), to assist with racial integration by the promotion of rugby to the black community.  In particular he urged the Springboks to go all out to win the 1995 world cup, which they did after a bruising final match in Capetown with New Zealand's world-famous national team.  To watch this fine film is to gain an appreciation of the human spirit in the face of adversity on several different levels.

It's so spiritual and overwhelmingly beautiful. Director Clint Eastwood's latest film Invictus embodies not only this amazing music, but other similar elements that will move you in indifferent manners.Morgan Freeman finds himself nominated for yet another Academy Award, for his flawless portrayal of the real life president of South Africa (and much more), Nelson Mandela. While I was glad to see Jeff Bridges finally take home his Oscar, Freeman was definitely a competing factor.The film essentially serves as two great film genres in one: the bio-pic, and the sports movie. It excels at both feats.After serving nearly three decades of his life sentence in prison for supposed `sabotage', Nelson Mandela is released and elected president of the very country that barred him from his freedoms. You wouldn't guess that Mandela was aware of this however, as he holds no grudge and wants nothing more than to give back to his country. The fact that this all actually happened, only makes us appreciate the film that much more.This is the early 90s, and although the apartheid has come to an end, racism's ugly head is still looming about. Mandela is desperate to evoke a change for his people. He finds comfort in learning that the world cup of Rugby, which only comes around every four years, is due its turn in history and South Africa has a slight chance of advancing forward with a shot at the main event. It's a very small chance, but Mandela seizes the moment in an effort to use this as an opportunity to unite his country.He befriends the captain of the team known as the Springboks, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon). Being raised by ingnorant parents, Francois sees something in President Mandela that births the inspiration for a change in his life. Francoios further finds courage and faith in his team through Mandela, and fights with all he has to lead them to the world cup. With the odds stacked astronomically high against them, the Springboks will need the support of each other and their nation, to succeed.Invictus wasn't quite as good as some of Eastwood's other works, but when virtually every picture he directs are among the best ever made, it's not at all a discredit to him or the film. Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon are both sensational and this movie will at the very least inspire you to do good things in your life.",4,Invictus Review,1276646400,"06 16, 2010",2010,2708,"['INVICTUSSTARRING', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Tony', 'Kgoroge', 'Marguerite', 'Wheatley', 'Patrick', 'Mofokeng', 'Matt', 'Stern', 'Julian', 'Lewis', 'Jones', 'Adjoa', 'Andoh', 'Scott', 'EastwoodWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Anthony', 'Peckham', 'based', 'book', 'John', 'CarlinDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Clint', 'EastwoodRated', 'PG', '13Genre', 'DramaRelease', 'Date', '11', 'December', '2009There', 'something', 'African', 'music', 'soul', 'so', 'spiritual', 'overwhelmingly', 'beautiful', 'Director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'latest', 'film', 'Invictus', 'not', 'only', 'amazing', 'music', 'other', 'similar', 'elements', 'will', 'move', 'indifferent', 'manners.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'nominated', 'yet', 'Academy', 'Award', 'flawless', 'portrayal', 'real', 'life', 'president', 'South', 'Africa', 'much', 'more', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'finally', 'take', 'home', 'Oscar', 'Freeman', 'was', 'definitely', 'competing', 'factor.The', 'film', 'essentially', 'two', 'great', 'film', 'genres', 'one', 'bio-pic', 'sports', 'movie', 'feats.After', 'serving', 'nearly', 'three', 'decades', 'life', 'sentence', 'prison', 'supposed', 'sabotage', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'released', 'elected', 'president', 'very', 'country', 'barred', 'freedoms', 'would', ""n't"", 'guess', 'Mandela', 'was', 'aware', 'however', 'grudge', 'nothing', 'more', 'give', 'back', 'country', 'fact', 'actually', 'happened', 'only', 'appreciate', 'film', 'much', 'more.This', 'early', '90s', 'apartheid', 'come', 'end', 'racism', 'ugly', 'head', 'still', 'looming', 'about', 'Mandela', 'desperate', 'evoke', 'change', 'people', 'comfort', 'learning', 'world', 'cup', 'Rugby', 'only', 'around', 'four', 'years', 'due', 'turn', 'history', 'South', 'Africa', 'slight', 'chance', 'advancing', 'forward', 'shot', 'main', 'event', 'very', 'small', 'chance', 'Mandela', 'moment', 'effort', 'use', 'opportunity', 'unite', 'country.He', 'captain', 'team', 'known', 'Springboks', 'Francois', 'Pienaar', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Being', 'raised', 'ingnorant', 'parents', 'Francois', 'something', 'President', 'Mandela', 'inspiration', 'change', 'life', 'Francoios', 'further', 'finds', 'courage', 'faith', 'team', 'Mandela', 'fights', 'lead', 'world', 'cup', 'odds', 'stacked', 'astronomically', 'high', 'Springboks', 'will', 'need', 'support', 'other', 'nation', 'succeed.Invictus', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Eastwood', 'other', 'works', 'when', 'virtually', 'picture', 'are', 'best', 'ever', 'made', 'not', 'discredit', 'film', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'are', 'sensational', 'movie', 'will', 'very', 'least', 'inspire', 'do', 'good', 'things', 'life']",N/A

The fact that this film does NOT trigger your gag reflex (at least, not until close to the end) is a testament to Eastwood's poignant direction, and the rock-solid performances of the film's two leads.The film chronicles Nelson Mandela's plight to unite the blacks and whites of post-apartheid South Africa.  His weapon of choice?  Rugby.  Mandela decides to take one of the nation's most hated teams (its colors have often been associated with racism), and rally support for his newly-freed country.  His (somewhat unknowing) conspirator in the scheme is Francois Pienaar, star player for the Springboks.Freeman shines at Mandela, and Damon gives an understated performance as Pienaar.  They help anchor the script, penned by SHERLOCK HOLMES-scribe Anthony Peckham.  The script seems to want to take a journey deep into the heart of sentimentality, but Eastwood restrains himself.  He makes full use of the soaring music we've come to expect in these films, and the dramatic shots; this is far from Eastwood's best direction, as he seems to give in to genre expectations, instead of defy them (as he did so boldly in UNFORGIVEN).  Yet, he never caves completely, and the film comes off without that sentimental aftertaste this genre usually leaves behind.  The film itself is beautifully shot, with some engaging rugby scenes.  Indeed, Freeman and Damon may have gotten the Oscar-nods (deservedly so), but the game itself is the star of the film, at times even overshadowing the politics.  Which lends the film to some bitter scrutiny, of course; but INVICTUS is so well-made and put together, you really have a hard time criticizing it as a movie.  It's best to view it as a sports film, one which happens to have some political implications; and indeed, it stands as one of the better entries in that genre.",4,"Not Eastwood's best, but a solid film nonetheless.",1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,1895,"['INVICTUS', 'one', 'inspiring', 'sports', 'dramas', 'can', 'very', 'easily', 'make', 'gag', 'fact', 'film', 'NOT', 'trigger', 'gag', 'reflex', 'least', 'not', 'close', 'end', 'testament', 'Eastwood', 'poignant', 'direction', 'rock-solid', 'performances', 'film', 'two', 'leads.The', 'film', 'chronicles', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'plight', 'unite', 'blacks', 'whites', 'post-apartheid', 'South', 'Africa', 'weapon', 'choice', 'Rugby', 'Mandela', 'take', 'one', 'nation', 'most', 'hated', 'teams', 'colors', 'have', 'often', 'been', 'associated', 'racism', 'rally', 'support', 'newly-freed', 'country', 'somewhat', 'unknowing', 'conspirator', 'scheme', 'Francois', 'Pienaar', 'star', 'player', 'Springboks.Freeman', 'shines', 'Mandela', 'Damon', 'understated', 'performance', 'Pienaar', 'help', 'anchor', 'script', 'penned', 'SHERLOCK', 'HOLMES-scribe', 'Anthony', 'Peckham', 'script', 'want', 'take', 'journey', 'deep', 'heart', 'sentimentality', 'Eastwood', 'full', 'use', 'soaring', 'music', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'films', 'dramatic', 'shots', 'far', 'Eastwood', 'best', 'direction', 'give', 'genre', 'expectations', 'instead', 'defy', 'did', 'so', 'boldly', 'UNFORGIVEN', 'never', 'completely', 'film', 'off', 'sentimental', 'aftertaste', 'genre', 'usually', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'engaging', 'rugby', 'scenes', 'Indeed', 'Freeman', 'Damon', 'may', 'have', 'gotten', 'Oscar-nods', 'deservedly', 'so', 'game', 'star', 'film', 'times', 'even', 'overshadowing', 'politics', 'Which', 'film', 'bitter', 'scrutiny', 'course', 'INVICTUS', 'so', 'well-made', 'put', 'together', 'really', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'criticizing', 'movie', 'best', 'view', 'sports', 'film', 'one', 'have', 'political', 'implications', 'indeed', 'one', 'better', 'entries', 'genre']",N/A

In 1995, Mandela used the sport of rugby to bring a nation together, and now, Freeman, in 2009, uses his talent as an actor to show the world on the silver screen how one man's courage and fortitude brought together a nation of 43 million. As for a quick-reference guide on rugby, it is football without pads and it is rough. Forty-minute halves and no timeouts. No forward passing...and if you have a kicker who can boot the ball a long way,that will help.

1271180,A2XCQVAP1URA97,B002JCSWV6,Dddd,"[2, 2]","I am eagerly awaiting the release of Invictus on BluRay.  I saw this in theatres when it came out, and I left the theatre as did most people with I think a look and a sense of complete wonderment on my face.  I often feel jaded when seeing films nowadays (for no reason other than this world can make you see films through a prism of cynicism), but Invictus is one of those rare gems that manages to be both a brilliant sports film, and a brilliant political film about the psyche and power of sport, and its ablility to unite, in every sense of the word, and even under the most fractured conditions where incredible distrust and animosity from years of apartheid and other injustices reign.The film sports some incredibly accurate and authentic rugby scenes (I am a fairly new supporter of the sport beginning from the 2003 World Cup- I would also recommend ""Forever Strong"" for some of you rugby fanatics), accurately demonstrating the pulverizingly brutal, but ultimately gentlemanly nature of the warriors who play this incredible sport.  More importantly, and what I always believe makes a sports movie rise above the rest is the story of the people in it. This movie is equal parts Francois Pienaar (M. Damon), and Nelson Mandela (M. Freeman).  The genius of Mandela was in sensing the incredible power that Sport had over the previously ruling White Class, and in selling his political plan for unification of South Africa by bringing about reconciliation between whites and blacks.  Mandela does this by convincing Francois Pienaar (captain of SA national Rugby team) and by extension, the Other SpringBoks (nickname for South African Rugby squad) that a victory in the 1995 Worldcup would unify South Africa, even though skepticis abounded at at every turn.Mandela exhibited political genius by being able to credibly assert to his supporters (who wanted all symbols associated with Springboks eliminated from national discourse) that if he, who had suffered worse than most under apartheid could forgive (and his suffering is given some treatment in the movie in a trip by the Springboks to Robben Island where Mandela was imprisoned and where the players see what he had to actually endure), than they should also be able to forgive, and move on in bringing together the new South Africa- both black and whites.  Mandela knows and gambles ultimately on the unifying power of Sport itself and particularly the Springboks who are revered by White South Africans, but hated by Blacks as they represented a symbol of apartheid and opporession.Slowly through a series of political maneuvers and with the help of Francois Pienaar who slowly begins to understand and believe in Mandela's plan, and even begins to understand what it means to be South African, and redefines his national identity.  How Mandela does this is in my opinion the result of some real political genious and courage.Clint Eastwood, once again, delivers a terrific film.  There are just so many moments of this movie that I absolutely love and cannot wait to see again.  So many minor characters that leave grand impressions (like Mandela's head of security and many of the white security forces who are working with Mandela's security team to keep him alive and safe). The scenes never feel forced or cliched.  It is just beautifully done, and I would recommend this to anyone.  I believe that you will turn off your DVD player once this film is over with a sense of wonderment at just incredible this all was, and moreso, that it was true, and you will repeat those words, ""I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul."", Invictus ""unconquerable"".

1271184,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B002JCSWV6,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[0, 0]","""Invictus,"" produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, stars Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela, co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and an activist who strove to end apartheid, establish universal suffrage, and bring about free and democratic elections in South Africa.  After he became president, Mandela set out to heal the deep divisions that poisoned the political, social, and cultural atmosphere of his homeland.  He looked to the future, although he would never completely forget the twenty-seven years that he had spent as a political prisoner.  Mandela chose an unusual vehicle to propel his campaign of healing--rugby.  The Sprinbok team, beloved of white Afrikaners, was for the majority of black South Africans, a symbol of all that they despised.  Much to the consternation of his constituents, Mandela decided to publicly support the underdog Springboks and their captain, Francois Pienaar, hoping that a common interest in winning the Rugby World Cup would unite blacks and whites. In addition, he believed that if the Springboks were to capture the World Cup, it would shine a positive light on a nation that had previously been shunned by much of the world.Clint Eastwood is unable to avoid the clich&eacute;s that are characteristic of come-from-behind films featuring a weak team that strives, against all odds, to win a major championship.  The close-up scenes of hulking and grunting men pummeling and tackling one another are repetitious and a bit off-putting.  For most moviegoers, however, the reason to see ""Invictus"" is not to revel in the game of rugby, but rather to enjoy Morgan Freeman's subtle and understated portrayal of a man so charming, eloquent, and determined that he manages to disarm even those who dismissed him as a upstart.  Mandela takes the high road, envisioning a time when blacks and whites will live together in harmony.Matt Damon is fine as Francois Pienaar, captain of the Springboks, who cannot believe that his hapless team has become a national symbol.  As he gets to know Mandela, Pienaar grows to respect and admire the man, and learns how important it is to inspire others and set an example that they can emulate.  Other standouts are Tony Kgoroge as the hot-tempered Jason Tshabalala (the head of Mandela's security detail) who is in no mood to reconcile with the enemy.  Adjoa Andoh brings dignity and intelligence to the role of Brenda Mazibuko, Mandela's personal assistant.  She is the voice of reason, questioning the wisdom of wasting political capital on rugby when South Africa is on the verge of economic collapse.Morgan Freeman said that Mandela ""moves people for the better; that is his calling in life.""  This feel-good movie offers few surprises.  Some critics have called it bland and safe, and that is probably a fair criticism.  Nevertheless, ""Invictus"" is worth seeing for Freeman's depiction of a man who chose to forgive those whom he had every reason to hate.",4,"""This is the time to build our nation.""",1262217600,"12 31, 2009",2009,2942,"['Invictus', 'produced', 'directed', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'co-winner', 'Nobel', 'Peace', 'Prize', '1993', 'activist', 'who', 'strove', 'end', 'apartheid', 'establish', 'universal', 'suffrage', 'bring', 'about', 'free', 'democratic', 'elections', 'South', 'Africa', 'became', 'president', 'Mandela', 'set', 'out', 'heal', 'deep', 'divisions', 'poisoned', 'political', 'social', 'cultural', 'atmosphere', 'homeland', 'looked', 'future', 'would', 'never', 'completely', 'forget', 'twenty-seven', 'years', 'had', 'spent', 'political', 'prisoner', 'Mandela', 'chose', 'unusual', 'vehicle', 'propel', 'campaign', 'healing', 'rugby', 'Sprinbok', 'team', 'beloved', 'white', 'Afrikaners', 'was', 'majority', 'black', 'South', 'Africans', 'symbol', 'despised', 'Much', 'consternation', 'constituents', 'Mandela', 'decided', 'publicly', 'support', 'underdog', 'Springboks', 'captain', 'Francois', 'Pienaar', 'hoping', 'common', 'interest', 'winning', 'Rugby', 'World', 'Cup', 'would', 'unite', 'blacks', 'whites', 'addition', 'believed', 'Springboks', 'were', 'capture', 'World', 'Cup', 'would', 'shine', 'positive', 'light', 'nation', 'had', 'previously', 'been', 'shunned', 'much', 'world.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'unable', 'avoid', 'clich', 'eacute', 'are', 'characteristic', 'come-from-behind', 'films', 'featuring', 'weak', 'team', 'odds', 'win', 'major', 'championship', 'close-up', 'scenes', 'hulking', 'grunting', 'men', 'pummeling', 'tackling', 'one', 'are', 'repetitious', 'bit', 'off-putting', 'most', 'moviegoers', 'however', 'reason', 'see', 'Invictus', 'not', 'revel', 'game', 'rugby', 'rather', 'enjoy', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'subtle', 'understated', 'portrayal', 'man', 'so', 'charming', 'eloquent', 'determined', 'disarm', 'even', 'who', 'dismissed', 'upstart', 'Mandela', 'high', 'road', 'envisioning', 'time', 'when', 'blacks', 'whites', 'will', 'live', 'together', 'harmony.Matt', 'Damon', 'fine', 'Francois', 'Pienaar', 'captain', 'Springboks', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'hapless', 'team', 'become', 'national', 'symbol', 'know', 'Mandela', 'Pienaar', 'respect', 'admire', 'man', 'how', 'important', 'inspire', 'others', 'set', 'example', 'can', 'emulate', 'Other', 'standouts', 'are', 'Tony', 'Kgoroge', 'hot-tempered', 'Jason', 'Tshabalala', 'head', 'Mandela', 'security', 'detail', 'who', 'mood', 'reconcile', 'enemy', 'Adjoa', 'Andoh', 'dignity', 'intelligence', 'role', 'Brenda', 'Mazibuko', 'Mandela', 'personal', 'assistant', 'voice', 'reason', 'questioning', 'wisdom', 'wasting', 'political', 'capital', 'rugby', 'when', 'South', 'Africa', 'verge', 'economic', 'collapse.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'said', 'Mandela', 'moves', 'people', 'better', 'calling', 'life', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'offers', 'few', 'surprises', 'critics', 'have', 'called', 'bland', 'safe', 'probably', 'fair', 'criticism', 'Nevertheless', 'Invictus', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Freeman', 'depiction', 'man', 'who', 'chose', 'forgive', 'whom', 'had', 'reason', 'hate']",N/A

As an American, this was going to be no easy task. We don't know the first thing about Rugby, Eastwood doesn't really present the sport well, and what's worse is that he doesn't really present the events well. I came into the film being interested in the subject after studying it, and what happened before the events of most of this movie. The movie spends all of 30 seconds on this, thus giving no real context on why this is all important. But if they'd done that, it would have been hard to be invested anyways. It's a sports movie, but it's not a sports movie, but it uses all the cliches of one. The result is a very fine balance the movie has to walk, but it ends up tripping over. When speaking of a portrayal of this subject matter, cheesy should NEVER be something you use to describe it at any point during the proceedings, but cheesy is the word I'd use here more times than not, especially when it comes to the music.There's a song called ""Colorblind"" that plays in the middle of the movie that gives us the heftiest dose of unintentional cheese. The song is exactly what you think it is. It's an inspirational song with the most insufferable lyrics ever conceived, with its chorus being ""I'm colorblind!,"" followed by African chants. This is supposed set the tone for an ""important"" scene, and it comes off as anything but. The same with the title song that plays over the credits. The music is just a metaphor for the film as a whole. Too heavy-handed and serious for its own good, when the film is made by a bunch of Americans.The cast is decent, but only headlined by two stars, and mostly unknowns for the rest. Matt Damon is a blank slate with a distracting accent. But Morgan Freeman highlights the film in a performance that just fits like a glove. Who's the most natural person in Hollywood to play Nelson Mandela? Morgan Freeman. And Freeman does very well in the role, even if the writing is far from top-notch.Overall, the great Nelson Mandela deserves a lot better than what this movie gives. Its tone is inconsistent and all over the place. It hold very little interest for the viewer. It's ineptly paced and it's just SO BLOODY LONG! Well, it's only 2 hours and 20 minutes, but it feels a lot longer. Sorry Eastwood, I just wasn't feeling this film, and I wasn't really a fan with what you did with it.

Mr Eastwood surrounds himself with worthy backup; he has tirelessly absorbed more education on filming, composing, directing, and acting than possibly anyone else working today; and he has an eye for a story. His most recent work, ""Invictus"", is proof positive.It is a history lesson that is watchable, human, and brave. Nelson Mandela came out of years of incarceration in a tiny cell to lead his country with a measure of strength and forgiveness that is reminiscent of Gandhi. That he emerged from such a trial without bitterness and with such wisdom is a miracle.Upon his winning presidency of South Africa, Mandela - played with absolute conviction by the great Morgan Freeman - becomes convinced that the way to bring the wounded, racially divided country together is to make the national rugby team shine. The Springboks are sort of the Detroit Lions of rugby, with the diffrence being they are the ONLY team in the country. And at the time of the story, they are perennially in the cellar of the rugby world.Mandela's eye is caught by the forthright leader of the Springboks, played by Matt Damon, who does his usual excellent acting as well as a pretty good go at a South African accent. Between the two of them, Mandela and Francois encourage the beaten team to greater and greater heights, until they enter the World Cup as worthy frontrunners.Set against the turbulent time period as South Africa moved away from apartheid, it is a film powerful in scope, restrained in portrayal, and not without a few red herrings thrown in to keep the viewer just a little off-balance.The performances are all spot-on; the direction is superb.

It is also the title of an important poem, one which Nelson Mandela found inspiring during his long walk to victory, penned in the 1800s of the same title, which includes these famous words:It matters not how strait the gate,How charged with punishments the scroll,I am the master of my fate:I am the captain of my soul.Mandela faced perhaps even more formidable challenges upon becoming the first post-Apartheid president of South Africa than he had trying to end Apartheid -- how does one manage this kind of change, this kind of forgiveness, this kind of reconciliation?  Perhaps the most important scene in the film for me was the one in which Mandela discusses with Francois Pienaar, the South African rugby team's captain, what kind of leadership philosophy one needs to have, particularly when faced with a seemingly hopeless task that most have written off as unobtainable.  Leadership by example is important here; courage in the face of adversity and perseverance even as all appear negative is also key.Mandela is played admirably by Morgan Freeman; Freeman has been a friend to Mandela for many years, and even so found the role daunting.  How does one portray a living legend?  Francois Pienaar is played by Matt Damon; Damon recounts in press information for the film his meeting with Pienaar, and how Pienaar, an actual rugby player, is so much larger physically than Damon (who, despite his athletic build, is of a more average size).  Clint Eastwood, now a master film maker, was able through his camera work to disguise this fact -- rugby players in general are larger than average!The rugby scenes are very well done; I saw this film with an audience where most had never been exposed to rugby before, but they had no problem figuring out the basic pattern of play, and so problems with rules and strategies did not become a hindrance.  The political scenes, which could also have the potential of descending into arcana that would lose a non-South African audience, were also well crafted to show important issues without delving into the minutiae of politics that end up being distracting.  The on-field and off-field struggles are juxtaposed, and the film shows how the rugby World Cup helped to bring the divided nation together -- of course, this would be to simplify history far too much, but it was an important step.The victory of the Springboks, with Mandela handing the victory cup to Pienaar, is considered by many to be one of the greatest moments in sports history (the BBC testifies to this, among others).Overall, this is a feel-good film that has important historical and social themes.  The cell on Robben Island, where Mandela spent more than half of his nearly three-decade political imprisonment, was actually used in the film -- an important element that helps show the importance of Mandela's actions, and the power of how what might have been quite legitimate hatred and desire for vengeance had become an even more powerful drive for unity and reconciliation.This is an important film, and worthy of viewing and discussion.  It qualifies as one of the most significant South African films, also, as much of the cast are from South Africa and much of the filming was done at or near the actual venues of this taken-from-true-life film.Ah, if only I were 20 years younger, I'd be out on the rugby pitch tomorrow!",5,The agony and the ecstacy,1262304000,"01 1, 2010",2010,3419,"[""'Invictus"", 'Latin', 'term', 'meaning', 'invincible', 'unconquerable', 'also', 'title', 'important', 'poem', 'one', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'found', 'inspiring', 'long', 'walk', 'victory', 'penned', '1800s', 'same', 'title', 'famous', 'words', 'not', 'how', 'strait', 'gate', 'How', 'charged', 'punishments', 'scroll', 'am', 'master', 'fate', 'am', 'captain', 'soul.Mandela', 'faced', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'formidable', 'challenges', 'becoming', 'first', 'post-Apartheid', 'president', 'South', 'Africa', 'had', 'trying', 'end', 'Apartheid', 'how', 'one', 'manage', 'kind', 'change', 'kind', 'forgiveness', 'kind', 'reconciliation', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'scene', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'Mandela', 'Francois', 'Pienaar', 'South', 'African', 'rugby', 'team', 'captain', 'what', 'kind', 'leadership', 'philosophy', 'one', 'have', 'particularly', 'when', 'faced', 'seemingly', 'hopeless', 'task', 'most', 'have', 'written', 'off', 'unobtainable', 'Leadership', 'example', 'important', 'here', 'courage', 'face', 'adversity', 'perseverance', 'even', 'appear', 'negative', 'also', 'key.Mandela', 'played', 'admirably', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Freeman', 'been', 'friend', 'Mandela', 'many', 'years', 'even', 'so', 'found', 'role', 'daunting', 'How', 'one', 'portray', 'living', 'legend', 'Francois', 'Pienaar', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Damon', 'press', 'information', 'film', 'meeting', 'Pienaar', 'how', 'Pienaar', 'actual', 'rugby', 'player', 'so', 'much', 'larger', 'physically', 'Damon', 'who', 'athletic', 'build', 'more', 'average', 'size', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'now', 'master', 'film', 'maker', 'was', 'able', 'camera', 'work', 'disguise', 'fact', 'rugby', 'players', 'general', 'are', 'larger', 'average', 'rugby', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'saw', 'film', 'audience', 'where', 'most', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'exposed', 'rugby', 'had', 'problem', 'figuring', 'out', 'basic', 'pattern', 'play', 'so', 'problems', 'rules', 'strategies', 'did', 'not', 'become', 'hindrance', 'political', 'scenes', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'potential', 'descending', 'arcana', 'would', 'lose', 'non-South', 'African', 'audience', 'were', 'also', 'well', 'crafted', 'show', 'important', 'issues', 'delving', 'minutiae', 'politics', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'distracting', 'on-field', 'off-field', 'struggles', 'are', 'juxtaposed', 'film', 'how', 'rugby', 'World', 'Cup', 'helped', 'bring', 'divided', 'nation', 'together', 'course', 'would', 'be', 'simplify', 'history', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'important', 'step.The', 'victory', 'Springboks', 'Mandela', 'handing', 'victory', 'cup', 'Pienaar', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'moments', 'sports', 'history', 'BBC', 'testifies', 'others', '.Overall', 'feel-good', 'film', 'important', 'historical', 'social', 'themes', 'cell', 'Robben', 'Island', 'where', 'Mandela', 'spent', 'more', 'half', 'nearly', 'three-decade', 'political', 'imprisonment', 'was', 'actually', 'used', 'film', 'important', 'element', 'show', 'importance', 'Mandela', 'actions', 'power', 'how', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'legitimate', 'hatred', 'desire', 'vengeance', 'had', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'drive', 'unity', 'reconciliation.This', 'important', 'film', 'worthy', 'viewing', 'discussion', 'one', 'most', 'significant', 'South', 'African', 'films', 'also', 'much', 'cast', 'are', 'South', 'Africa', 'much', 'filming', 'was', 'done', 'actual', 'venues', 'taken-from-true-life', 'film.Ah', 'only', 'were', '20', 'years', 'younger', ""'d"", 'be', 'out', 'rugby', 'pitch', 'tomorrow']",N/A

What could have been a powerful little drama ends up being a volley between a hero president of South Africa and a Rugby Field.  Granted we know a lot about the extraordinary Nelson Mandela and his surviving imprisonment to be released and form a government that through his inspiration brought an end to Apartheid.  This little story about how he focused on encouraging a Rugby team's determination and success in winning the 1995 World Cup for Rugby and for bringing together a splintered country into a unified whole is well worth knowing, but little else happens here - we discover no insights into Nelson Mandela's character or that of his chosen inspirer Franois Pienaar. Clint Eastwood is usually far more sensitive and dramatic.The name of the movie is taken from the 1875 poem that inspired Mandela during his years of imprisonment.  And it seems appropriate to quote that full poem here:INVICTUSOut of the night that covers me,Black as the Pit from pole to pole,I thank whatever gods may beFor my unconquerable soul.In the fell clutch of circumstanceI have not winced nor cried aloud.Under the bludgeonings of chanceMy head is bloody, but unbowed.Beyond this place of wrath and tearsLooms but the Horror of the shade,And yet the menace of the yearsFinds, and shall find, me unafraid.It matters not how strait the gate,How charged with punishments the scroll.I am the master of my fate:I am the captain of my soul.William Ernest HenleyHenley may not have become a poet known for anything else but this poem, but he will always be quoted when it comes to stories such as this one.  The superb actor Morgan Freeman endures denture and facial make up and a shaky new accent as Nelson Mandela, but this is a flat performance - OK, but not memorable.  Matt Damon obviously buffed up for his role and learned  a new accent as Franois Pienaar and seems to know his mission, but again the performance is flat line and not impressive.  The entire cast is adequate for the little they contribute.  Yes, we want to love this movie and the ending does make us swell with admiration, but it is the getting there that seems an overwrought and excessive 93 minutes!

By that score, Invictus is an example of great direction, where Eastwood crafts a film in which an American audience can truly care about a sporting event we don't play in a land we don't know very well and a leader of vision.When Nelson Mandela was elected the first black leader of South Africa there was a lot of fear in the air. As many whites feared that the no longer oppressed blacks would try to take revenge. An early target is the national rugby team, the Springboks and their colours, green and gold.  Which now black dominated sports committees want to change the name and the colors to something new rather than what is seen as the hated name and colours of the apartheid era.Into this steps Morgan Freeman as Mandela saying that this is exactly what whites fear, that minor things they love will be stripped away because they can. Instead the government must take steps to make the `bokks something the nation can get behind. That they now in power must show a compassion and understanding that was denied to them. It is the true vision of the real Mandela delivered masterfully by Freeman for an entire nation, focused by Eastwood's film on just one element, international sport and the effect is wonderful.Matt Damon wonderfully underplays his role as the rugby captain of a team seen as the champions of white power who are now expected to appeal to the entire nation. In him Eastwood projects the hope of all young South Africans on intelligence who come to realize how powerful Mandela's message of reconciliation is. When some of his players balk at having to learn the words of the new national anthem, Damon doesn't argue with them, just says ""The first line is `God bless Africa,' I think we could use that."" And walks out to let his men consider it. Do they all come over, of course not, but you see the seed planted.Beyond seeing the change in the sports fans and players you also have a subplot of the changes in Mandela's presidential bodyguard as the previously all black guards of the leader find they have to integrate with white police officers who use to be `the enemy.' Both sides have their prejudices but as things progress both recognize the fact they are all cops and have a view and professionalism that bridges race.If I have a flaw with this film it's the time line or lack there of and with Warner's packaging. There is no sense of how much time is passing between events or, until it happens that they made the finals. This lack of passing time though was the only real flaw I had with an otherwise great film. As a DVD the issue I have is that you cannot jump through the previews. WB wants you to watch their commercials even though you've bought the film and this is a drag.Most Americans don't understand the rules of rugby or the cultural issues of South Africa but Eastwood's eye and subtle attention to fine detail easily works past this. You can understand the players and the game and the hopes and the dreams. Dreams not of athletic prowess but of something far, far greater. The viewer understands they are playing for more than a trophy but truly playing for their nation. Because of Eastwood's skill as a story teller you care about the true victory they are reaching for even as they play a game you don't get in a land you don't know.",5,"An amazing tale of not sports, but humanity",1282262400,"08 20, 2010",2010,3424,"['late', 'Joel', 'Siegel', 'said', 'when', 'great', 'actor', 'great', 'performance', 'great', 'acting', 'When', 'everyone', 'great', 'directing', 'score', 'Invictus', 'example', 'great', 'direction', 'where', 'Eastwood', 'crafts', 'film', 'American', 'audience', 'can', 'truly', 'care', 'sporting', 'event', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'land', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'very', 'well', 'leader', 'vision.When', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'was', 'elected', 'first', 'black', 'leader', 'South', 'Africa', 'was', 'lot', 'fear', 'air', 'many', 'whites', 'feared', 'longer', 'oppressed', 'blacks', 'would', 'try', 'take', 'revenge', 'early', 'target', 'national', 'rugby', 'team', 'Springboks', 'colours', 'green', 'gold', 'now', 'black', 'dominated', 'sports', 'committees', 'want', 'change', 'name', 'colors', 'something', 'new', 'rather', 'what', 'seen', 'hated', 'name', 'colours', 'apartheid', 'steps', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Mandela', 'saying', 'exactly', 'what', 'fear', 'minor', 'things', 'love', 'will', 'be', 'stripped', 'away', 'can', 'Instead', 'government', 'must', 'take', 'steps', 'make', 'bokks', 'something', 'nation', 'can', 'get', 'behind', 'now', 'power', 'must', 'show', 'compassion', 'understanding', 'was', 'denied', 'true', 'vision', 'real', 'Mandela', 'delivered', 'masterfully', 'Freeman', 'entire', 'nation', 'focused', 'Eastwood', 'film', 'just', 'one', 'element', 'international', 'sport', 'effect', 'wonderful.Matt', 'Damon', 'wonderfully', 'role', 'rugby', 'captain', 'team', 'seen', 'champions', 'white', 'power', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'expected', 'appeal', 'entire', 'nation', 'Eastwood', 'projects', 'hope', 'young', 'South', 'Africans', 'intelligence', 'who', 'come', 'realize', 'how', 'powerful', 'Mandela', 'message', 'reconciliation', 'When', 'players', 'balk', 'having', 'learn', 'words', 'new', 'national', 'anthem', 'Damon', ""n't"", 'argue', 'just', 'first', 'line', 'God', 'bless', 'Africa', 'think', 'could', 'use', 'out', 'let', 'men', 'consider', 'Do', 'come', 'course', 'not', 'see', 'seed', 'planted.Beyond', 'seeing', 'change', 'sports', 'fans', 'players', 'also', 'have', 'subplot', 'changes', 'Mandela', 'presidential', 'bodyguard', 'previously', 'black', 'guards', 'leader', 'find', 'have', 'integrate', 'white', 'police', 'officers', 'who', 'use', 'be', 'enemy', 'sides', 'have', 'prejudices', 'things', 'recognize', 'fact', 'are', 'cops', 'have', 'view', 'professionalism', 'race.If', 'have', 'flaw', 'film', 'time', 'line', 'lack', 'there', 'Warner', 'packaging', 'sense', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'passing', 'events', 'made', 'finals', 'lack', 'passing', 'time', 'was', 'only', 'real', 'flaw', 'had', 'otherwise', 'great', 'film', 'DVD', 'issue', 'have', 'can', 'not', 'jump', 'previews', 'WB', 'watch', 'commercials', 'even', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'film', 'drag.Most', 'Americans', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'rules', 'rugby', 'cultural', 'issues', 'South', 'Africa', 'Eastwood', 'eye', 'subtle', 'attention', 'fine', 'detail', 'easily', 'can', 'understand', 'players', 'game', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'Dreams', 'not', 'athletic', 'prowess', 'something', 'far', 'far', 'greater', 'viewer', 'understands', 'are', 'playing', 'more', 'trophy', 'truly', 'playing', 'nation', 'Eastwood', 'skill', 'story', 'teller', 'care', 'true', 'victory', 'are', 'reaching', 'even', 'play', 'game', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'land', 'do', ""n't"", 'know']",N/A

1271203,A3RFXU3P0XKKF4,B002JCSWV6,"Herbert L Calhoun ""paulocal""","[5, 13]","This is Clint Eastwood's cinematic ""morality play"" on race, about a white South African rugby team enroute to the World Cup championship during 1995. Mandela had just recently taken over the Presidency of the country and was trying to set the country on a new higher moral footing, but seemed to have as his highest priority, keeping up with the white rugby team's success. As usual Mandela comes off as the super-moral being that in real life he actually is. Only this time his morality is enlarged upon so that white South Africans can ""piggyback"" on it in fiction, in ways that they could never actually achieve in reality. In the process, white South African humanity is enlarged by the same extent to which black subjectivity and black humanity is diminished. Whites are thus transformed from the moral low ground (being the foaming-at-the-mouth racist architects of Apartheid) to the moral high ground (via Mandela acting as their surrogate honorary white). All the more to advanced the barely transparent subtext, which is to pretend that Apartheid is so far into the past as to have never occurred. Every time images of Apartheid attempts to rear its ugly head, Mandela (the designated white surrogate morality police) slaps it back down again with the ""Rodney King mantra: ""Can't we all just get along"" and with the moral force of William Ernest Henley's poem Invictus.It is an easy and much overused trope to re-humanize white racists through carefully orchestrated morality plays, allowing them to regain the moral high ground by fiat. What is left unsaid in the subtext of this movie is that as of yet, there aren't any visible reasons to enlarge white South African humanity based on its deeds since the Mandela revolution. With only cosmetic adjustments, the racist social order remains pretty much intact as it did during Apartheid. So the conversion had to be done via a fictionalized drama, a drama cast in the mold of the universal white humanity with Mandela as their ""stand-in,"" and Clint Eastwood as their ""moral pimp.""And sadly, even with Mandela (Morgan Freeman) in the lead role, there is no visible black humanity, or black subjectivity. Unless that is, you can call a single cameo ""militant pout"" by Mandela's daughter, black humanity; or the genuflecting black maids, shantytown street urchins, or blacks sports fans wildly cheering a rugby match, as black humanity. (I didn't even know that Black South Africans liked rugby, do they?)In these ""soft racist morality plays,"" it seems that black humanity and white humanity are mutual exclusive conditions: They simply cannot coexist together (otherwise white humanity might be contaminate (or is it annihilated)?). Movies with racial themes are either of an all-black cast, or an all white cast, or, in the post-modern world, a mixed cast but told only through white morality, humanity and subjectivity. That is to say, it is told only as a white race-based drama with blacks used only as de-sexed props. This movie of course is of the latter sort. Here, only white South Africans have families; sit down to eat dinner, live in middle class homes; go to work each day; kiss their kids and their wives; express love and affection towards each other, etc. In order for blacks to do this, they of course must have their own segregated drama -whether depiction of the drama occurs in Cape Town, Rio or LA.Therefore one can see this movie as either being inspiring or irritating depending on what side of the international racial dividing line one resides. If you are white, there is nothing not to like about this movie: The racist social order remains unperturbed and what's more, white humanity is magnified beyond what it is capable of in reality. The hooded killers of the Apartheid regime regain the moral high ground (and become Mandela's bodyguards no less) simply by learning the black version of the South African National Anthem.On the other hand, if you are black, the movie is subtly demeaning and dehumanizing, but not any more so than most ""soft racist"" Hollywood productions are: Blacks here, are either all sycophants, maids, ghetto creatures, or in Mandela's cabinet. But none, including Mandela himself, have a normal private subjective life. Even the ANC, which ostensible now rules South Africa, was mentioned only in passing. Apparently, a white-based drama (even with a black in the lead) cannot stomach having a genuine black humanity show up on the screen. Black extremes are permitted, but none in the middle, and none considered just normal.On a personal note, I have been to South Africa four times since the end of Apartheid, once to Johannesburg, twice to Pretoria, and once to Cape Town. To an outsider, things look different only on the surface. The underlying tension is palpable enough to cut it with a knife. At 5pm, all the whites jump into their gun-racked SUVs and pickups and head for the hills (the lily white suburbs). Like in Detroit, Newark, or Chicago, the inner city streets are left to the large number of unemployed young Black males growling with nothing to do and nothing to lose. I was told that at night they rent AK-47s by the hour just to commit crimes.

There were many moments during this movie when I was deeply moved, to the extent of recalling the unexpectedly strong emotions I experienced the evening Barack Obama was elected our own President.  Perhaps there's some irony that this unification of South Africans was achieved by vanquishing a series of external rivals, but I suppose this is innocent enough when accomplished via sports rather than war (isn't that part of the purpose of international sports events like the Olympics?).Summing up, the positives of this movie vastly outweigh the negatives, so I highly recommend it.",4,Uplifting and inspiring - a great story for our times,1282694400,"08 25, 2010",2010,1715,"['movie', 'single', 'episode', 'history', 'South', 'Africa', 'right', 'election', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'President', 'namely', 'rise', 'rugby', 'team', 'constant', 'struggles', 'winning', 'World', 'Cup.Let', 'start', 'acknowledging', 'legitimate', 'criticisms', 'movie', 'many', 'have', 'been', 'noted', 'other', 'reviewers', 'rather', 'limited', 'sociohistorical', 'context', 'provided', 'issue', 'viewers', 'not', 'already', 'fairly', 'familiar', 'history', 'South', 'Africa', 'b', 'pacing', 'plot', 'uneven', 'are', 'gaps', 'story', 'often', 'lack', 'proper', 'buildup', 'links', 'events', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'clear', 'c', 'portrait', 'Mandela', 'rather', 'incomplete', 'especially', 'regard', 'why', 'be', 'such', 'saintly', 'leader', 'yet', 'very', 'strained', 'relationships', 'family.Having', 'noted', 'negatives', 'recommend', 'ignoring', 'main', 'purpose', 'movie', 'present', 'story', 'racial', 'cultural', 'reconciliation', 'powerfully', 'uplifting', 'inspiring', 'movie', 'fully', 'regard', 'small', 'part', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'board', 'were', 'many', 'moments', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'deeply', 'moved', 'extent', 'recalling', 'unexpectedly', 'strong', 'emotions', 'experienced', 'evening', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'was', 'elected', 'own', 'President', 'Perhaps', 'irony', 'unification', 'South', 'Africans', 'was', 'achieved', 'vanquishing', 'series', 'external', 'rivals', 'suppose', 'innocent', 'enough', 'when', 'accomplished', 'sports', 'rather', 'war', ""n't"", 'part', 'purpose', 'international', 'sports', 'events', 'Olympics', '.Summing', 'up', 'positives', 'movie', 'vastly', 'outweigh', 'negatives', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

After spending 27 years in a very small cell in South Africa, Nelson Mandela was released and he was elected president of his country in 1990. But he had a serious problem. Not only he, but all the blacks in South Africa had been despised, oppressed, and terribly mistreated their entire lives. Many lived in dirty unhygienic shacks. They were poor. They were very angry. The whites retained their prejudicial attitudes. They kept their idea that they were superior. They believed that only they could rule the country. They felt that ""ignorant blacks"" would ruin their land.How could the new president unite the people of his country? How could he start afresh? What could he take away from the white oppressors without increasing their anger? What could he give the blacks? How could he inspire his nation? How could he get the world to respect South Africa?Nelson Mandela devised the idea that he might unite his people by having both blacks and whites join together in hoping that the South African Rugby Team would win the 1995 World Cup.

1271209,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B002JCSWV6,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 3]","Clint Eastwood was probably the only filmmaker who could produce a film on Nelson Mandela that centered on a side event that became a major initiative in the history of South Africa and the world. He chose to center the film on the Springboks and their victory in the World Cup of 1995. That was a brilliant idea since it showed Mandela as a real transformer of human beings. It also brilliantly proves man does not make history. A certain thickness of imbecility was needed to pile up in the minds of some not to see that the enslaved majority of the South African population could not remain slaves for ever. Let my people go. The choice, if it is a choice and not the only logical sequel of the fifty preceding years that Mandela does was to center his own action on a sports event that could unify the people in a victory. And we can see how little it takes to attract the attention and the heart of the other, a cup of tea for instance served by the President to his guest Franois, like Jesus washing the feet of his disciples before the Last Supper, though forgiveness is not that easy, and yet easier for the victims of the bad treatment than for the people who inflicted that bad treatment. Those had to become aware of the hardship of that treatment to finally be conscious enough to forgive themselves and to forgive the victims. Clint Eastwood then adds some symbols to strike our eyes: the little black boy carried by the white cops on their shoulders after the victory. The green Springboks cap Mandela is wearing at the end, not as a provocation of the All Blacks, but as a symbol of his support to his team and as a symbol of the unity of the country around their team. This film is first of all emotional for us who have lived these dark years and harbored for a night or several some AWOL special force soldiers who were deserting apartheid. And how many pages of ANC press releases have we translated for the whole world to know about their fight. And yet we wonder at the end who is the main character of this story. Nelson Mandela or Franois Pienaar. This appears clearly in the remarks these two exchange when Mandela gives the cup to Franois. ""Thank you Franois for what you have done for South Africa."" ""No, Mister President thank you for what you have done for South Africa."" And the green Springboks cap Nelson Mandela wears all the time is not a provocation to the All Blacks, but the sign of his support to his team, and the symbol of the reunification of South Africa thanks to that sports event. Then the answer Franois makes to the journalist when this one asks him if he was encourage in his fight by the 63,000 people in the Stadium, is prophetic: ""We were not supported by 63,000 people but by the 43 million South Africans."" That makes us very humble in front of history that no one can stop, than some can only slow down, ,and some others encourage and help in its own direction. And we will forget Henry Kissinger's answer when he refused to support Nelson Mandela, the political prisoner that he accused of being a communist.

Pouliot,"[0, 0]","So-so in Soweto""Invictus"" tells the story of how newly-installed South African president Nelson Mandela sought racial peace in his country be reaching out to the national rugby team, beloved of whites. The film is utterly inspirational and often quite moving. Morgan Freeman plays Mandela with dignity and intelligence; Matt Damon plays rugby captain Francois Pienaar with tightly-wound intensity. Having travelled to South Africa, my wife and I were thrilled to see some of the sights around Cape Town. Robben Island, Table Mountain and even the Ferryman's Tavern were prominently featured in the film. Two prominent South African musical groups -- Ladysmith Black Mambazo and the Soweto String Quartet, were given roles.But the film itself had a lassitude that took away from its intense subject. Though it was set only a year or to after decades of brutal white minority rule, the film's emotions were muted. For those who don't know much about South Africa, little historical context was provided. And certain symbolic story arcs -- for instance the stance of the rugby team toward the new Xhosa national anthem -- were raised, and then dropped without development. Pienaar himself was an enigma. As a beneficiary of the old system, one might have expected to see him struggle with the demands of being ruled by those once considered terrorists. But none of this was developed.As an inspirational film about how leaders must sometimes buck popular wisdom to lead people to a wider vision, Invictus is incomparable.

An attending of a rugby match, and watching the fans reaction -- divided down racial lines -- to their home country's team, inspires Mandela to contact Francois Pienaar, captain of the South African Springboks rugby team, to see if sport can be used to bring the people together.One concern I had about the success of this film in the U.S. is that it centers around rugby, a sport which has never been embraced by Americans. I wondered if people would be able to identify with it, but the movie is filmed in such a way that prior knowledge of the sport of rugby (of which I have absolutely NONE) is unnecessary. There are stand-up-and-cheer moments in the film, but it's difficult to label this movie as a sports film. It's much more than that. There is a lot of standard sports movie fare within this film, but I wouldn't call it cliche in any way.This film is a probable Oscar contender for Best Picture, but Morgan Freeman's nomination for Best Actor, I would label as a certainty. Matt Damon, as South African rugby captain Francois Pienaar was quite possibly the best I've ever seen him. The South African soundtrack added some great flavor to the film.At the risk of sounding corny, it's been a while since I saw a film that I found inspiring.

""Invictus"" proves the answer is a hearty yes.On the positive side Matt Damon gives a very restrained performance while Morgan Freeman is convincing and inspirational as Nelson Mandela. The rugby action scenes were breathtaking, as were the natural surroundings/background of the South African scenery. Some of the most powerful moments in the movie came when no one was talking or acting -- when the slums of the outlying townships and confines of Robben Island prison were shown.That said, the movie is fairly one dimensional. It's a story about a President looking to unify a populace, and the rugby team he uses to achieve that goal. Aside from Damon's Francois Pienaar the viewer gets to know one other player on the team. Mandela's family is mentioned numerous times and is seemingly plays an important role in his decision-making, but there is only one scene where we see that side of him (and it seems like there was no good reason to keep the scene in the movie).A sense of pacing is also lacking. As the movie opens it's about a year to the World Cup and the Springboks are getting smoked by England in a match. The next thing we know the team is having a couple practices (under a new coach that is never introduced), a coaching clinic in one of the townships and then all of a sudden it's the World Cup championship. Of course it's not feasible to show everything leading up to that final match, but more of the in between would have been nice.It also would have been nice to see how the general population reacts to the team's quest for the Cup. We see a growing bond between Mandela's security men over the game of rugby, but nothing of what was transpiring among people outside the inner circle of the government and the rugby team itself. The movie is supposed to show how rugby and the Springboks' run in the World Cup helped heal the wounds of apartheid, but that is seldom, if ever, shown.All said, a very enjoyable movie, but one with its share of flaws.",3,"Not bad, not great",1282089600,"08 18, 2010",2010,2032,"['Can', 'movie', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'mired', 'deficiencies', 'Invictus', 'answer', 'hearty', 'yes.On', 'positive', 'side', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'very', 'restrained', 'performance', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'convincing', 'inspirational', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'rugby', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'breathtaking', 'were', 'natural', 'surroundings/background', 'South', 'African', 'scenery', 'most', 'powerful', 'moments', 'movie', 'came', 'when', 'one', 'was', 'talking', 'acting', 'when', 'slums', 'outlying', 'townships', 'confines', 'Robben', 'Island', 'prison', 'were', 'shown.That', 'said', 'movie', 'fairly', 'one', 'dimensional', 'story', 'President', 'looking', 'unify', 'populace', 'rugby', 'team', 'achieve', 'goal', 'Aside', 'Damon', 'Francois', 'Pienaar', 'viewer', 'know', 'one', 'other', 'player', 'team', 'Mandela', 'family', 'mentioned', 'numerous', 'times', 'seemingly', 'important', 'role', 'decision-making', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'side', 'was', 'good', 'reason', 'keep', 'scene', 'movie', 'sense', 'pacing', 'also', 'lacking', 'movie', 'year', 'World', 'Cup', 'Springboks', 'are', 'getting', 'smoked', 'England', 'match', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'team', 'having', 'couple', 'practices', 'new', 'coach', 'never', 'introduced', 'coaching', 'clinic', 'one', 'townships', 'then', 'sudden', 'World', 'Cup', 'championship', 'course', 'not', 'feasible', 'show', 'everything', 'leading', 'up', 'final', 'match', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice.It', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'how', 'general', 'population', 'team', 'quest', 'Cup', 'see', 'growing', 'bond', 'Mandela', 'security', 'men', 'game', 'rugby', 'nothing', 'what', 'was', 'transpiring', 'people', 'inner', 'circle', 'government', 'rugby', 'team', 'movie', 'supposed', 'show', 'how', 'rugby', 'Springboks', 'run', 'World', 'Cup', 'helped', 'heal', 'wounds', 'apartheid', 'seldom', 'ever', 'shown.All', 'said', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'one', 'share', 'flaws']",N/A

Mandela has recently been freed from a hellish prison term of over 30 years and has won the popular vote for South Africa's presidency. Not everyone feels comfortable with this and the tension in the country is at its worst. Pondering the country's morale and hundreds of administrative matters, Mandela seizes a far fetched opportunity, but must enlist help. Matt Damon gives a hell of a performance as the captain of a soccer (football) team in South Africa, the Springboks, secretly tasked with the impossible dream of winning the World Cup! If that is not enough, he senses that failure would mean a lost opportunity for bringing a shattered nation together again.Freeman is indescribably incandescent in Mandela's humanity, the silent musings over problems, the undying strength and grace. The viewer can almost see mind gears churning toward resolution, as Freeman's emotions are palpable onscreen. Freeman's kinetics undeniably show compassion and caring for his people, black or white, rich or poor, gender and faith neutral...the kind of unconditional love that only sainted beings are historically ascribed. Please move over, Mother Teresa and Ghandhi...make room on the bench... for Mandela belongs in the highest altitude and this movie took him there!

Draper,"[1, 2]","As part of his program to inspire Franois Pienaar, played by Matt Damon, the captain of the South African rugby team; Nelson Mandela, played by Morgan Freeman, inculcates upon him an piece of literary wisdom that had inspired him to endure his 27 year imprisonment. During that time, Mandela learned all he could about the white people who had put him there by mastering their language and reading their books. In the process, he found a 19th Century poem which embodied the ""unconquerable soul"". This famous poem, from which the movie derives it's name, ends with these lines: ""I am the master of my fate:I am the captain of my soul"". The power and conviction of this poem moved Nelson Mandela and helped direct his life and goals.In the movie, as apparently in life, Mandela, now as President of South Africa, develops an equally unconquerable passion for the national sport of rugby, which he uses to unite his country. The Springboks, a mostly white team, are cheered on by the white South Africans, but soundly ""booed"" by the blacks because of what they represent. However, Mandela sets about to change all that. His obsession with the sport and modus operandi tend to bewilder both his staff as well as his fellow black countrymen. Yet it is revealed it to be a brilliant move for Mandela, the struggling team, and for the whole country, both black and white. His impressively forgiving attitude toward the white power is demonstrated when he, for example, invites Franois Pienaar to the presidential office for tea and takes him under his wing. Will he have the power to set this poetry in motion and lead to victory? That is the question that this film answers.I give this film 4 stars for the inspirational story, yet I personally find it to be rather syrupy, predictable and lacking in depth. For example, none of the real racial tension which could have made it more believable and powerful is seen in this movie. Nelson Mandela himself was no Mahatma Gandhi, but there was only one slight hint in this movie that he was less than a saint. Morgan Freedman played this role masterfully, though I found the Matt Damon character to be rather bland. So if you are just looking for a feel-good movie, without all the ugly reality, this is a good choice.",4,Poetry in Motion?,1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,2259,"['part', 'program', 'inspire', 'Franois', 'Pienaar', 'played', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'captain', 'South', 'African', 'rugby', 'team', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'played', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'piece', 'literary', 'wisdom', 'had', 'inspired', 'endure', '27', 'year', 'imprisonment', 'time', 'Mandela', 'learned', 'could', 'white', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'put', 'there', 'mastering', 'language', 'reading', 'books', 'process', 'found', '19th', 'Century', 'poem', 'embodied', 'unconquerable', 'soul', 'famous', 'poem', 'movie', 'name', 'lines', 'am', 'master', 'fate', 'am', 'captain', 'soul', 'power', 'conviction', 'poem', 'moved', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'helped', 'direct', 'life', 'goals.In', 'movie', 'apparently', 'life', 'Mandela', 'now', 'President', 'South', 'Africa', 'equally', 'unconquerable', 'passion', 'national', 'sport', 'rugby', 'unite', 'country', 'Springboks', 'mostly', 'white', 'team', 'are', 'cheered', 'white', 'South', 'Africans', 'soundly', 'booed', 'blacks', 'what', 'represent', 'However', 'Mandela', 'change', 'obsession', 'sport', 'modus', 'operandi', 'tend', 'bewilder', 'staff', 'as', 'well', 'fellow', 'black', 'countrymen', 'revealed', 'be', 'brilliant', 'move', 'Mandela', 'struggling', 'team', 'whole', 'country', 'black', 'white', 'impressively', 'forgiving', 'attitude', 'white', 'power', 'demonstrated', 'when', 'example', 'Franois', 'Pienaar', 'presidential', 'office', 'tea', 'wing', 'Will', 'have', 'power', 'set', 'poetry', 'motion', 'lead', 'victory', 'question', 'film', 'answers.I', 'give', 'film', '4', 'stars', 'inspirational', 'story', 'personally', 'find', 'be', 'rather', 'syrupy', 'predictable', 'lacking', 'depth', 'example', 'none', 'real', 'racial', 'tension', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'believable', 'powerful', 'seen', 'movie', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'was', 'Mahatma', 'Gandhi', 'there', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'slight', 'hint', 'movie', 'was', 'less', 'saint', 'Morgan', 'Freedman', 'played', 'role', 'masterfully', 'found', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'character', 'be', 'rather', 'bland', 'So', 'are', 'just', 'looking', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'ugly', 'reality', 'good', 'choice']",N/A

It's all a little too manipulative by the end, which is a shame as that detracts from some very fine acting and a good script.But Invictus is still a pleasure to watch and is a very well-made film, all in all. It shows a magic moment in the very troubled history of this land, and the heart of Mandela's message of peace and tolerance and turning the other cheek comes across quite powerfully. That's the real soul of this film, not the rugby, and the final scene distracts from that as Invictus becomes a somewhat cheesy sports flick for its last thirty minutes.

Invictus is a brilliant biographical/sports drama directed by Clint Eastwood starring Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon. The story is based on the John Carlin book ""Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Changed a Nation"" centered on events in South Africa before and during the 1995 Rugby World Cup, hosted in that country following the dismantling of apartheid regime. Freeman and Damon play, South African President Nelson Mandela and Franois Pienaar, the captain of the South African rugby union team the Springboks.  The title Invictus is translated from Latin as unconquered, and is the title of a poem by English poet William Ernest Henley (1849-1903).This is the true story of a man who was released after almost three decades in the harsh prisons of South Africa and that was to assume leadership of the nation that had imprisoned him. His personal forgiveness of white South Africa was the torch that illuminated that nation's Truth and Reconciliation Commissions. This being one of the very few examples in world history of a nations people who have actually made personal, and political efforts to address, forgive, and pardon the many brutal, and murderous actions of both sides in the struggle for freedom, and democracy. While Mandela attempts to tackle the country's biggest problems such as crime, unemployment, civil unrest, and international relations he watches a game of the Springboks, the national rugby team. Mandela knows that the blacks in the stadium always cheer against their home team, as the Springboks, and their team colors represent prejudice, and apartheid in their minds. Mandela remembers that he too did the same while imprisoned for 17 years on Robben Island. Many South Africans, both white and black, doubt that the rugby team will unite a nation torn apart by over half a century of racial segregation, conflict, and prejudice. For many non-whites, especially the ANC black leftist radicals, the Springboks symbolize white supremacy. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the international 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year's time, Mandela is faced with the problem on whether or not to support or disband the faltering team. It is then that he decideds to meet with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, Franois Pienaar  (Matt Damon), and questions whether a Springboks victory in the World Cup might unite and inspire their nation. Mandela perceives Francois to be of good heart and character, and shares with him a poem, ""Invictus"", that had inspired him during his long lonely time in prison. Can and will Mandela's and Pienaars belief and stance behind their theory that this team can successfully unite the country prevail?  Could any nation obsessed by its national sport whether it is soccer, basketball, baseball, football or its standing in the World Olympics be able to unify, and redeem itself before a world audience?Clint Eastwood seems to have always had the unusual ability to understand the many irrational aspects of human emotion, and existence. Despite the numerous books, documentaries, and historical pieces written about South Africa it is he alone that has managed to make a wonderful, inspiring film about this important historical event, and its consequences. Morgan Freeman (who personally met, and befriended Mandela) does a great job of evoking the man Nelson Mandela, who is as much a secular saint of Africa as Gandhi of India is perceived to be. He portrays him as a cordial, confident, balanced yet strong personality.  Matt Damon gives what I believe to be the best performance of his career playing the tough, dedicated rugby captain, Francois Pienaar, an Afrikaner, child of racism, transformed by his contact with Mandela.

Not surprisingly, his supporters see this as the ultimate opportunity for pay back to the white community for all the years of oppression.  But Mandela is a different kind of leader.  He believes in working hard to unite all the people and forgiving those who have harmed him and his people. Everyone assumes Mandela will replace the white leadership of the struggling national rugby team with his own.  However, Mandela sees this as an opportunity to unify the country through sports.  He commits himself to working with the existing white leadership and particularly the captain of the rugby team played by Matt Damon. He challenges Damon to rise to the occasion and capture the World Cup which they are hosting. He is taking a great risk with the future of his leadership.  Based on the true story of Nelson Mandela and South Africa, it is part history, part leadership lesson and a moving sports drama.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[1, 1]","During his 27 years in prison, Nelson Mandela regularly turned to a poem Called Invictus, and found profound inspiration.During his time as President he continued to turn to this poem, and knowing it by heart, wrote it out long hand, and to the Captain of the Sprinboks passed it, who found profound inspiration.During my life, I found profound inspiration in Nelson Mandela, and if a man can live in the unfair divided regime called apartheid, can spend so much time in prison, and emerge wise instead of rancorous, and can become president of a nation so divided, it raises the bar of human possibility, and inspires us to do better. If Mandela can solve the unsolvable problems of South Africa, if the Berlin Wall can fall, then cannot my own country's problem be solved, could there be peace in Nothern Ireland. All of these things which once seemed impossible have come to pass.And Invictus the movie invites us to see Mandela in elegant action, uniting a divided nation, averting civil unrest and civil war, reviving the sport of apartheid (rugby), saving the Springboks from being disbanded, and playing a pivotal role in inspiring their triumphs.Clint and Morgan, between them have won numerous Academy Awards on their previous collaborations. Morgan Freeman won best Supporting Actor for Million Dollar Baby playing Clint's sidekick, and played Clint's sidekick in Unforgiven.Morgan Freeman impresses as Mandela, who he knows personally, and does an outstanding job. As much if not more is conveyed through a nod, a gesture and a facial expression than through words. Matt Damon impresses as the Rugby Captain. Having played rugby myself, he totally convinces in his body language and movement as a rugby player.Clint Eastwood does an impressive job outside his normal territory and familiar genre, making the rugby scenes very true to life. Usually the cameras are off field, here they are up close and personal in the thick of the action.My one critique of the movie is that it lacks something Hollywood likes, namely the conflict, drama, and the hubris of the characters.In Changeling for example, Christine Collins has to overcome great adversity, and transform from a mom mourning her missing child to an activist, even being committed to a psychiatric hospital because she disagreed with the police captain.In Invictus, the great Nelson Mandela adversity has already happened before the events of this movie happen, so the great dramas of his life remain unexplored, and the drama of his wife Winnie being charged with murder also remains unexplored. A quality movie made about all that, would surely win many awards.Invictus remains a great movie, it's funny sometimes, it's gripping, it's inpiring, it's even exciting. Although it's Morgan Freeman's movie, it's Eastwood's humor that's pervasive. It's a slice of Mandela, but not the whole cake.Trivia. Watch out for the other Eastwoods, Kyle scores the music. Scott, scores the winning points, and plays No. 10 for the Springboks. Invictus means, unconquerable, invincible. I hope this was helpful to you.",4,Eastwood shoots.

El-Hewie""","[1, 4]","Hard to believe that a movie about Nelson Mandela would place his passion for rugby at the center of his presidency. It would appear as if the man went to prison for 27 years for the sake of promoting rugby. Alternatively, that Mandela was so indifferent to the responsibilities of his position to the extent of preoccupation with sport, over the overwhelming challenges of his nation, was inconvenient.The movie merely spent few minutes in a clean, well-painted prison cell that does not look any thing like a prison, with no single hint on how Mandela get in or out of prison. For a reasonable person, the movie would be a slap on the face for all the great principles the man stood for. For young people, the movie presented Mandela as a sports promoter, in the same ranks of the WWF's promoters or Don King's boxing tales.When you expect the rugby scenes to end and the real Mandela to shine, you get more rugby trainings and matches, inside the locker rooms, training fields, and neighborhood tours, until the movie ends with a win over New Zealand. Worse yet was the setup of the office of the presidency that appeared like a punch of servants surrounding their master. The servants' functions were ridiculously unpresidential, as if the country lacked any ministry for education, army, health, etc and that all South Africa got was a team of Boy Scouts arranging the president's rugby promotion.Having heard about Sadat's movie and being Egyptian myself, I could easily tell that it is hard for Americans to understand different cultures. The main difficulty I had with the movie was the sense that the American actors could not represent the real people around Mandela or that watching rugby for two long hours was burdensome. Getting used to watching well-protected football players, watching rugby players crash to the ground without helmets or shoulder padding was inconvenient.Only in Clint Eastwood's movie, one could see a presidential physician diagnoses his patient's illness on the fly. Mandela's physician was magically able to manage his condition of exhaustion without transporting the president to the hospital. Furthermore, the Physician's manner of delivering instructions to Mandela's staff appeared ridiculously obsolete. Even in Charlie Chaplin's movies, physicians were better represented to suit their era. Not in Clint Eastwood's movies.One could fairly conclude that the movie was made to entertain targeted audience that is fascinated with sport more than the real Mandela. The joke that Mandela believed that his salary was too much contradicted his use of the state helicopter to visit the rugby team during training. More jocular was the scene of the president filling the rugby calendar in his office. I do not doubt the sincerity of the producer in trying to make sense of Mandela's mission. However, the movie is an insult to all those who stood for Mandela. In particular, the total absence of any intellectual or statesmen next to Mandela, in all the movie's scenes, beside his security guards and secretaries, was an unfair characterization of the presidency of Mandela.Mandela's likes should have been left to Spike Lee for his unquestionable representation of Malcolm X's legend.",3,Mandela for rugby! making mockery of a greater cause.,1260662400,"12 13, 2009",2009,3221,"['Hard', 'believe', 'movie', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'would', 'place', 'passion', 'rugby', 'center', 'presidency', 'would', 'appear', 'man', 'went', 'prison', '27', 'years', 'sake', 'promoting', 'rugby', 'Alternatively', 'Mandela', 'was', 'so', 'indifferent', 'responsibilities', 'position', 'extent', 'preoccupation', 'sport', 'overwhelming', 'challenges', 'nation', 'was', 'inconvenient.The', 'movie', 'merely', 'spent', 'few', 'minutes', 'clean', 'well-painted', 'prison', 'cell', 'not', 'look', 'thing', 'prison', 'single', 'hint', 'how', 'Mandela', 'get', 'prison', 'reasonable', 'person', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'slap', 'face', 'great', 'man', 'stood', 'young', 'people', 'movie', 'presented', 'Mandela', 'sports', 'promoter', 'same', 'ranks', 'WWF', 'promoters', 'Don', 'King', 'boxing', 'tales.When', 'expect', 'rugby', 'scenes', 'end', 'real', 'Mandela', 'shine', 'get', 'more', 'rugby', 'trainings', 'matches', 'locker', 'rooms', 'training', 'fields', 'neighborhood', 'tours', 'movie', 'win', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Worse', 'yet', 'was', 'setup', 'office', 'presidency', 'appeared', 'punch', 'servants', 'surrounding', 'master', 'servants', 'functions', 'were', 'ridiculously', 'unpresidential', 'country', 'lacked', 'ministry', 'education', 'army', 'health', 'etc', 'South', 'Africa', 'got', 'was', 'team', 'Boy', 'Scouts', 'arranging', 'president', 'rugby', 'promotion.Having', 'heard', 'Sadat', 'movie', 'being', 'Egyptian', 'could', 'easily', 'tell', 'hard', 'Americans', 'understand', 'different', 'cultures', 'main', 'difficulty', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'sense', 'American', 'actors', 'could', 'not', 'represent', 'real', 'people', 'Mandela', 'watching', 'rugby', 'two', 'long', 'hours', 'was', 'burdensome', 'Getting', 'used', 'watching', 'well-protected', 'football', 'players', 'watching', 'rugby', 'players', 'crash', 'ground', 'helmets', 'shoulder', 'padding', 'was', 'inconvenient.Only', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'movie', 'one', 'could', 'see', 'presidential', 'physician', 'patient', 'illness', 'fly', 'Mandela', 'physician', 'was', 'magically', 'able', 'manage', 'condition', 'exhaustion', 'transporting', 'president', 'hospital', 'Furthermore', 'Physician', 'manner', 'delivering', 'instructions', 'Mandela', 'staff', 'appeared', 'ridiculously', 'obsolete', 'Even', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'movies', 'physicians', 'were', 'better', 'represented', 'suit', 'era', 'Not', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'movies.One', 'could', 'fairly', 'conclude', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'entertain', 'targeted', 'audience', 'fascinated', 'sport', 'more', 'real', 'Mandela', 'joke', 'Mandela', 'believed', 'salary', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'contradicted', 'use', 'state', 'helicopter', 'visit', 'rugby', 'team', 'training', 'More', 'jocular', 'was', 'scene', 'president', 'filling', 'rugby', 'calendar', 'office', 'do', 'not', 'doubt', 'sincerity', 'producer', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'Mandela', 'mission', 'However', 'movie', 'insult', 'who', 'stood', 'Mandela', 'particular', 'total', 'absence', 'intellectual', 'statesmen', 'Mandela', 'movie', 'scenes', 'security', 'guards', 'secretaries', 'was', 'unfair', 'characterization', 'presidency', 'Mandela.Mandela', 'likes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'unquestionable', 'representation', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'legend']",N/A

Pretty much anything with him in it is fair game.  And I gotta say, this was a fantastic movie.Freeman plays Nelson Mandela who has recently been elected President after Apartheid ends in South Africa.  Its a time of turmoil however as for the first time black people are given freedoms they haven't had and it makes those who held power for a long time very nervous. Mandela seeks to calm these fears and bring about peace and understanding.  And he chooses to do it a very unique way; Rugby.A violent sport to be sure but also very near and dear to South Africans.  Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) is the captain of the Springboks, South Africa's rugby team.  The World Cup is coming to South Africa and the Bokkes have not been playing the best.  Mandela meets with Pienaar and lets him know that he has great expectations for the team, and gives him some inspiration as well.  He also mandates that the Springboks start holding practices with some of the poorer children of the country for greater public appreciation of the team. In between this and their harsh training, its a very long chance that they will be able to win the cup.The characters for the most part in this movie are very believable.  Considering that apartheid was not too long before Mandel meets with these players though, I was amazed that the movie showed them all giving him the greatest respect.  I would have though a few team members might have been less than respectful in reality.The best thing about this movie was the soundtrack.  Great music and singing and it seemed very true to Africa.  I'm a big fan of World music and the soundtrack did not disappoint in this aspect.Overall the message was one of triumph and overcoming adversity.  I'm always a big fan of feel-good movies and this one didn't disappoint.  When you find yourself unconsciously smiling through the second half of the movie, you know its good.  I also shed a few tears as well.

But perhaps it's not best served being described as an Eastwood movie - this is Morgan Freeman's film.  This is the role he has been aching to play - Nelson Mandela, and Mandela himself said it was Freeman should play him in any movie depicting him.This is not the whole life story of Mandela though, it's a snapshot, used to illustrate the character and charisma of the man.  The moment is the 1995 Rugby World Cup, and charts Mandela's conviction that the Rugby was a chance to unite the blacks and whites in a moment of national pride, to finally give truth to his `rainbow nation'.  As such, and given the facts are well known, it's a fairly predictable movie - you know what happens.  What's more, some of the allegories for the bigger picture - the animosity between the white and black bodyguards breaking down as rugby unites them - are a little too trite.  There's a nagging feeling that a bigger more complicated picture is not explored - after all, is South Africa now everything Mandela wanted it to be?Perhaps it's just unkind to complain about these little niggles.. in much the same way that the rugby purists who say the rugby isn't quite right are missing the point.  This is about Mandela, and his people, and it tells a remarkable story, no matter how simplified and streamlined it is here.  Who could fail but be moved by Matt Damon standing in Mandela's actual cell and start to comprehend what the man went through, and the level of forgiveness he exhibited.Matt Damon does fine, if not inspiring.  Perhaps an actual South African actor would have been more convincing.. it's hard not to be constantly aware that you're looking at Damon, not a rugby team captain.  His dissimilarity in height and stature to the rugby team captain is well documented, but not that relevant to his impact on screen.  Freeman though is... well, just IS Mandela.  He inhabits the role so naturally that it hardly seems worth mentioning.. like that's just the way it's meant to be.  And the cinematography, particularly in crisp bluray hi-def, is wonderful.  And even those rugby scenes.. for the non-purists among you, they do a good enough job of giving a flavour of being in a match, to make the final game a suitable climax.  As an aside, let's not forget this is a period movie.  And with a clever blend of discreet special effects, clever photography and typically fastidious  art direction, the mid 90's are perfectly evoked.Politics are explored, Mandela's character is explored, rugby is explored.. it's a lot to cover.  Some elements, such as a deeper understanding of the political context, the solitary black player on the team, or Mandela's home life, are sacrificed as a result of covering so much ground.  But it's still riveting viewing, educational and uplifting, and a recommended watch.",4,Clint Eastwood hits gold again,1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,2974,"['Somehow', 'Clint', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'foot', 'wrong', 'lately', 'movie', 'not', 'perhaps', 'match', 'directorial', 'highs', 'great', 'solid', 'entry', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'perhaps', 'not', 'best', 'served', 'being', 'described', 'Eastwood', 'movie', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'film', 'role', 'been', 'aching', 'play', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'Mandela', 'said', 'was', 'Freeman', 'should', 'play', 'movie', 'depicting', 'him.This', 'not', 'whole', 'life', 'story', 'Mandela', 'snapshot', 'used', 'illustrate', 'character', 'charisma', 'man', 'moment', '1995', 'Rugby', 'World', 'Cup', 'Mandela', 'conviction', 'Rugby', 'was', 'chance', 'unite', 'blacks', 'whites', 'moment', 'national', 'pride', 'finally', 'give', 'truth', 'rainbow', 'nation', 'such', 'given', 'facts', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'What', 'more', 'allegories', 'bigger', 'picture', 'animosity', 'white', 'black', 'bodyguards', 'breaking', 'down', 'as', 'rugby', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'trite', 'nagging', 'feeling', 'bigger', 'more', 'complicated', 'picture', 'not', 'explored', 'South', 'Africa', 'now', 'everything', 'Mandela', 'wanted', 'be', 'Perhaps', 'just', 'unkind', 'complain', 'little', 'niggles..', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'rugby', 'purists', 'who', 'say', 'rugby', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'Mandela', 'people', 'remarkable', 'story', 'matter', 'how', 'simplified', 'streamlined', 'here', 'Who', 'could', 'fail', 'be', 'moved', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'standing', 'Mandela', 'actual', 'cell', 'start', 'comprehend', 'what', 'man', 'went', 'level', 'forgiveness', 'Damon', 'fine', 'not', 'inspiring', 'Perhaps', 'actual', 'South', 'African', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'convincing..', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'constantly', 'aware', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Damon', 'not', 'rugby', 'team', 'captain', 'dissimilarity', 'height', 'stature', 'rugby', 'team', 'captain', 'well', 'documented', 'not', 'relevant', 'impact', 'screen', 'Freeman', 'well', 'just', 'IS', 'Mandela', 'role', 'so', 'naturally', 'hardly', 'worth', 'mentioning..', 'just', 'way', 'meant', 'be', 'cinematography', 'particularly', 'crisp', 'bluray', 'hi-def', 'wonderful', 'even', 'rugby', 'scenes..', 'non-purists', 'do', 'good', 'enough', 'job', 'giving', 'flavour', 'being', 'match', 'make', 'final', 'game', 'suitable', 'climax', 'aside', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'period', 'movie', 'clever', 'blend', 'discreet', 'special', 'effects', 'clever', 'photography', 'typically', 'fastidious', 'art', 'direction', 'mid', '90', 'are', 'perfectly', 'evoked.Politics', 'are', 'explored', 'Mandela', 'character', 'explored', 'rugby', 'lot', 'cover', 'elements', 'such', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'political', 'context', 'solitary', 'black', 'player', 'team', 'Mandela', 'home', 'life', 'are', 'sacrificed', 'result', 'covering', 'so', 'much', 'ground', 'still', 'riveting', 'viewing', 'educational', 'uplifting', 'recommended', 'watch']",N/A
1271263,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B002JCSWV6,Muzzlehatch,"[6, 7]","How can one not have huge expectations going into INVICTUS - the story of Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) using the Rugby World Cup of 1995 as a rallying point to help unify his troubled post-apartheid country, and forming a bond with the young captain of the traditionally-named (and hated by many blacks) Springboks, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon)?  Especially when it's directed by Clint Eastwood, whose two previous collaborations with Freeman won Best Picture and Director Oscars for Clint, with Freeman winning a Best Supporting Actor prize for MILLION DOLLAR BABY.  And being a huge Clint Eastwood fan who has seen everything he's directed or starred in....well, let's just say there are few films this year that I was looking forward to more.Of course massive expectations - however impossible to avoid - are frequently going to engender disappointment, and such is the case here to some extent - though there is more to like than not overall.  Freeman is just as great as I expected him to be - no, he doesn't sound exactly like Mandela, but he gets the cadences and speech patterns down pretty well, the charm and the moments of boyish impishness, and especially the sense of a troubled, lonely inner life that he has managed through supreme will to tame and use to his advantage.  This Mandela is a man determined to unite a country almost through sheer will, a man willing to be autocratic and domineering when he feels there is no other way, and a man who knows that winning over his enemies is just as important as keeping his friends.Matt Damon's Francois Pienaar is something of a cypher, a seemingly apolitical man interested in little beyond rugby, a leader himself but one who seemingly has even less chance of pulling his team from the brink of disaster than Mandela has of pulling his country up.  What Pienaar needs is confidence and spirit - something the president has in abundance; and what Mandela needs is a rallying point that both blacks and whites can get behind; obviously, in true sports-movie manner, they find each other and clearly couldn't succeed without both putting forth every effort.It's not the sports cliches that are really the problem here; after all, this is based on a true story, South Africa really WAS a giant underdog to win the World Cup, and they really did prevail against all odds.  And it's not Freeman or Damon, or any of the other fine actors; rather it's the shorthand that Eastwood and screenwriter Anthony Peckham use to show the country coming together which lacks substance and feels in the end the most cliched.  The Pienaars have a black maid who keeps quiet through most of the film, but finally gets her moments; the president's bodyguard staff is a mix of blacks and whites who initially distrust and dislike each other, and come to grudgingly respect each other, and so on.  Meanwhile little of the changing nature of the South African people in general is seen over the 5-year timespan of the film, and little of the attitudes of Pienaar's team, the Springboks, to becoming a symbol as much as a rugby team.Still the emotional power of the story does come through, in particular through the deep inner life that Freeman's Mandela manages to convey, a wisdom that understands something about how much more important reconciliation and forward-thinking is than revenge and recriminations.  I can't take credit for this thought, but I will mention that it's interesting how this film, like so much of Eastwood's past work is in a sense focused on revenge; except that in this case, revenge is seen as unambiguously wrong by the protaganist (and by extension, we the audience) and not to be applied.  The demons are exorcised, and we get a truly positive and life-affirming ending - one of the few in the director's entire filmography.

The list of ""redeeming"" movies would include He Got Game, Hoosiers, and The Natural.

But that was precisely my reaction to the new Clint Eastwood film ""Invictus"" which debuted in theaters across America today.""Invictus"" recalls the 1995 Rugby World Cup tourney which was held in South Africa.  The World Cup was the first major sporting event to take place in South Africa following the end of apartheid.  But this is by no means a movie about rugby.  Rather it is the compelling story about the courage and vision of two men....two very different men.Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) was the recently elected President of South Africa.  Here was a man who had spent most of his adult life courageously opposing the entrenched system of legal racial seperation in his beloved homeland known as ""aparteheid"".  Mandela had certainly paid a stiff price for his divergent political views.  In the late 1950's and early 1960's he was an anti-apartheid activist, and the leader of the African National Congress's armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe.  Mandela was loathed by the entrenched British establishment that was searching for ways to get rid of him once and for all.  Mandela was tried and conviced of sabotage and other crimes against the state by the prevailing National Party back in 1963.  Despite persistent calls for his release from political and religious leaders and from governments around the world Mandela would spend the next 27 years of his life in a prison cell.  While incarcerated Mandela read extensively and had plenty of time to ponder his philosophy of life.  He envisioned  that one day South Africa would become a color-blind ""Rainbow Nation"".  Mandela was finally released from prison in 1990 and in 1994 he was elected President of South Africa.  Shortly after his inauguration  President Mandela cast about for innovative ways to bring his disjointed nation together again.  He determined that the 1995 Rugby World Cup tournament to be held in his homeland to be the perfect vehicle to achieve his lifelong dream of a truly united South Africa.Meanwhile, Francois Pineaar (Matt Damon) was the captain of the South African Rugby team known as Springbok.  The team was not very good and there was but one black man on the club.  Springbok's prospects in the upcoming tourney were dismal.  Yet with the odds clearly stacked against him Mandela decided to  gamble most of his political capital and personal prestige and made it a national priority to win the World Cup.  He met with Pineaar several months before the competition.  Although from very different backgrounds the two men quickly discovered that they were kindred spirits.  Each was bound and determined to make this ""impossible dream"" become a reality.Although Matt Damon's star shines brightly in ""Invictus"" Morgan Freeman clearly steals this show.  I found it to be be one of those rare performances where I could simply not take my eyes off him.  He was that compelling!  I would compare Freeman's performance in this film to Jimmy Stewart's in ""Rear Window"" or perhaps more precisely to George C. Scott in ""Patton"".  ""Invictus"" is an extremely well-crafted and uplifting film that should earn numerous Oscar nominations. Clint Eastwood has outdone himself this time.

The entire film is briliantly directed. I think Eastwood took not only his biggest gamble ever with Invictus but he also created a very enjoyable and emotional story out of a point in history most of us in the United States knew little or nothing about. It seemed like an impossible task for Eastwood and Malpaso to make a great film about Mandelas new presidency while backdropping the story about how Mandela used rugby to bring his nation together in a new a brighter unity, and still do it effectivly and keep it insteresting. Here Eastwood pulled it off and managed to create a truly dramatic film that touches the heart and the soul. Its a wonderful and inspirational story. Morgan Freeman was astounding as Mandela. He should have earned the oscar for his perfectly rendered portrtrait of Mandela. His work is breathtaking and beautiful here. Before I saw this film I had no interest in sports or considered the idea that a sport could have such an effect on an entire nation. After I saw this film I gained a new admiration for such subjects. Eastwood has done an incredible job with this film. It didnt win the oscars that Unforgiven did, but in some ways it deserved to.

However, they failed at bringing the incredible moving story, the full stretch, to the screen.This is a true story, based on Nelson Mandella becoming President of South Africa, and the decisions he made, specifically to support and promote the Rugby team, with the idea that it would help bring both sides of his country, blacks and whites, together for the first time.I should have been blown away by this movie. I should have laughed and cried my heart out, and I'm not even into sports.  But I didn't.  This movie did not MOVE me, and I find that incredibly disappointing.I found the writing lacking in delivering a script that brought, what must have been, such a dramatic turmoil to the screen. The characters were not well developed, nor was their portrayel, by very talented actors, believable. They seemed somewhat lifeless, which leads me back to the writer (of the script and perhaps the book, which I have not read), and the director.The directing was at time confusing, especially on the rugby field, because it was hard to figure out what was going on.  A non-sports fan, should be able to watch a sports movie, and still understand what's going on.

Eye,"[1, 2]","The film, Invictus, is based upon the book written by John Carlin, and stars Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon as Francois Pienaar - the team leader of South Africa's predominately white (Afrikaner) national rugby team, the Springboks. It is an amazing story with a deeper lesson - Mandela's strategy to orchestrate a moment whereby the people of South Africa felt the unity that national pride can bring due to winning a Rugby World Cup. It reminds me of the fictional book (by Bryce Courtenay) & movie, The Power of One, also starring Freeman.  It, too, focuses on the unfairness & prejudice in South Africa during WWII.Carlin's book, Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation, details the true story about Mandela's efforts to ease racial inequality in South Africa by touching the emotions of the people. Mandela not only convinced the white Afrikans rugby players (albeit one black player) to get on board as an important nation-building measure, but also managed to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup game against New Zealand.  The Springboks won the game and the people were one as a nation  . Mandela's maneuver united the fans of rugby and fostered better race relations because of it.  At least that is the gist of Carlin's book and Freeman's movie since he bought the book rights to make this movie.  In 1996, Francois Pienaar also wrote a book about this historical event in his memoir, Rainbow Warrior.This movie invites viewers to enlighten themselves about the racial apartheid in South Africa and one man's attempt to eliminate it, even for a year, a month, one day.  Then too, the movie (and the book) describes the game of rugby, which is like a work of art in motion when well played. Watching a rugby game is exciting, viewers are emotionally engaged just witnessing the sheer strength & brute force exhibited by the players in a scrum. What an excellent idea Mandela had to try to bring South Africa together.

1271280,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002JCSWV6,RMurray847,"[3, 4]","INVICTUS is an interesting and often gripping film that nonetheless fails to deliver the emotional or intellectual blow it is clearly meant to.  This is due primarily to what is usually a strength of Clint Eastwood's work as director...and to the somewhat sanitized feel of the story.The film tells the true story of a small portion of Nelson Mandela's life, when he took a strong interest in the national rugby team of South Africa (the Springboks), because he believed their success would help him unite a divided country AND show the world the potential of the new South Africa.When we meet the Springboks and their captain (played by Matt Damon, in another understated, naturalistic performance that is quick making him a significant acting force)...they are a team of all but one white player.  They are avidly followed by the white population of South Africa...while at the same time they are playing well below their potential and essentially being lambasted by the media.  In the South Africa of that time (early `90s), the black citizens embraced soccer, and Rugby was the sport that served as a reminder of Apartheid, with the colors and name that symbolized that horrible time.President Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) senses that he might be able to convince a skeptical white population of his seriousness in being a leader for ALL by taking an interest in rugby.  It's a cynical move that is also sincere at the same time.  Mandela risks the anger of the blacks that elevated him to legendary status by convincing the National Sports commission to allow the Springboks to continue with their name and colors.All this occurs as the World cup of Rugby is just months away from coming to South Africa.  Mandela knows his efforts will amount to little if the team fails in the early going...so through meetings with Damon, he manages to pass a bit of inspiration down to the team.In a wonderful and telling scene, we see the Rugby team headed out to teach a rugby camp to kids in a poor, black neighborhood.  At first, the kids are only interested in Chester, the only black man on the team.  They swarm to him...oblivious to the rest of team and to the sport.  Yet we see slowly how these EXTREMELY reluctant coaches embrace their parts a role models and begin to work with the kids.  By the end of the day, all concerned are happily exhausted...and totally thrilled.  The scene is a clich&eacute; in many ways, but it is tidy and effective.  We begin to see how little victories will eventually yield the big victory Mandela (and the team) are hoping for.As a director, Eastwood always allows for a leisurely pace.  He lets actors breathe.  He lets them pause.  He keeps his camera on them for a second longer than any other director would.  This allows us, sometimes, to feel we know a character better.  We feel we've been invited to share in even the most mundane moments of their lives (this is why GRAN TORINO worked so well...we cared so much about the characters that we overlooked the deeply clich&eacute;d story arc).  But what the story of INVICTUS needs is more of a hurtling, headlong pace.  It ambles, even when the ""pressure cooker"" of the tournament and all it means for the country comes to a head.  There is little sense of urgency...and the film really could have used it.  I was always interested...but never to the point of giving myself over to emotion.That's also due in part to the fact that we've got two parallel stories (Mandela's and the team's).  They frequently intersect...but they rarely bounce off each other in unexpected ways.  Yes, it's a true story, but it takes such a leisurely, mostly expected course that it feels like a clich&eacute;d sports movie.  But we haven't thoroughly invested in the Springboks because we've spent so much time with Mandela, that the sports accomplishments seem secondary.  And our knowledge of Mandela is reduced almost exclusively to something akin to ""#1 Rugby fan.""  Clearly, he was a much, much more interesting and complex man...yet we are only shown very limited glimpses of him.  We see his keen yet instinctive grasp of the politics of race in his country.  We believe his desire to forgive the sins of the past so his country can move forward (his actions along these lines are the most inspiring moments of the film...and most come fairly early).  We get just the tiniest sense of his troubled domestic wife, although his wife Winnie is never mentioned by name.  I won't say he's portrayed as a one-dimensional saint...but it's close to it.The reason Mandela ISN'T just a one-dimensional saint is because of Morgan Freeman.  Eastwood's love of allowing his actors to act truly frees up the best in Freeman.  With MILLION DOLLAR BABY, Freeman won his first Oscar.  There's a chance he could win #2 with his latest work under Eastwood.  (I should also mention that one of Freeman's most overlooked performances was his stunning role in Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN.)  No actor is better than Freeman at taking one-dimensional, saintly characters (everything from DEEP IMPACT to even SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION) and giving them an inner life that is frequently only expressed by the subtlest changes of expression.  We're accustomed to Freeman's dulcet tones (what a great speaking voice he has)...but the reason he's in another category is because of the little things we barely notice.  And he is not only the perfect choice to play Mandela, he's probably the ONLY choice (in the way Forest  Whitaker was perfect for Idi Amin...not only was the acting outstanding, but the physical resemblance alone is a plus).In the end, I felt more educated that enlightened.  My mind had new things in it...but not my heart so much.  (There are a few moments, such as the sobering visit to Mandela's jail cell, that help to enlighten us as to how large an accomplishment Mandela's forgiveness was.)  If I had understood Rugby better, perhaps the games themselves would have been more exciting...but I suspect most of the action in them is fairly generic.  If I had seen more of Mandela's other work, perhaps I would have felt a greater sense of HIS accomplishment.In the end, there is much to admire in INVICTUS, and I certainly would encourage everyone to see it.  It is also the kind of film that will cause lots of folks to learn more about Mandela & South Africa.  (I can even see high school classes using it as a springboard for much more learning.)  But in the end, I couldn't help feeling just a little disappointed.",4,3.5 stars.

1271283,A1SBRISKS7PH7U,B002JCSWV6,Rob,"[0, 2]","A quietly superb film from Clint Eastwood, Invictus is another genre defying entry, from a director with a long track record of them, that is not quite a sports movie but neither is it a biography of its world famous central character Nelson Mandela.Anthony Peckham's clever script is nominally about Mandela's support - over fierce objections from his own party - for the hated national Springbok rugby team & how their improbable victory at the 1995 world cup finally overcame the bitter divisions of the apartheid era to unite the country at a point when civil war between blacks & whites looked inevitable.But what we have here is equally a subtle study in Mandela's brilliant grasp of strategy & leadership (he has his aides test him on the names of the Springboks so that when he meets them for the first time he can greet them like old friends) & his shrewd recognition that unless the black majority can demonstrate forgiveness to a sceptical & suspicious white minority - one that controls the banks, the police & the army - the country is doomed.Key to this is attracting much needed foreign investment (the eyes of the world are watching anxiously) & when Mandela learns that a billion people will be watching the rugby cup final he instantly grasps the PR significance of this for his country & for the world if the Springboks can win the cup.Freeman is impressively understated here not only capturing Mandela's physical mannerisms (the hunched shoulders from spending decades in a tiny cell) but also leaving it up to the audience to decide whether his public concern for those he must work with - expressed through a succession of carefully calibrated speeches - is genuine or simply the work of a brilliant tactician shrewdly exploiting his media image as a saint. There are hints, here & there, of Mandela's estrangement from his own family & these touchingly remind us that behind the public image is a man who paid a very high personal price for his actions.A convincingly beefed up Matt Damon is also excellent as the Springbok Captain Francois Piennar. Francois doesn't pretend to understand the politics of the situation but he can intuit immediately that the situation he's in concerns something far greater than just a sports victory as he tries to convince his sceptical team mates. As per Freeman it's delightfully understated acting & it's a very good demonstration of Damon's versatility.There's also a satisfying parallel storyline to Mandela's efforts which centres on his bodyguards. These guys are perpetually fearful of an assassination attempt & it's a task not made any easier by Mandela's habit of wanting to leave his entourage to go on impromptu walkabouts in the crowds. His security detail are a mixed team of black & whites who on first meeting view each other with barely disguised hostility. Indeed, on their initial encounter the first question out of the mouth of the black guard is 'Have you come to arrest me?'! In the hands of a lesser director & writer this would have descended into cringe-making backslapping & we're-all-brothers-under-the-skin proclamations, but Eastwood is too good a director to fall for this & the slow recognition that both teams are on the same side simply develops organically, without ever seeming forced.The climactic rugby scenes are satisfyingly crunchy, clearly filmed (there's a refreshing absence of Paul Greengrass-style shaky-cam shots) & the gist of the game is communicated clearly even if the specifics remain obscure. There's also a jaw-dropping scene involving a 747 Jumbo that is one of those outrageous moments so WTF? that it could only have come from real life (& indeed did actually happen).The stadium sequences depicting thousands of cheering supporters are pretty staggering & demonstrate just how far crowd software has come since Gladiator's famous arena shot. As impressive as that was I always felt there was something not quite right about it but the CG crowds packing Ellis stadium here are completely convincing, indeed overwhelming at times. Invictus is also, I think, superbly edited & it seemed to go by remarkably quickly for a two hour plus movie.As for Eastwood, he's a directorial marvel avoiding so many of the pitfalls inherent in this kind of material. There's no sense of self- importance about Invictus. The film is epic & yet intimate, if that makes any sense. It wears its themes lightly, as if aware that the material is so strong it doesn't need amping up. Eastwood's understated, unemphatic approach amusingly drives the lazy, the impatient & the immature viewer up the wall but I find his firm, gentle style so stirring it had me welling up with tears on more than one occasion.Whether it's Francois telling his stunned family he's been invited to tea with Mandela, an absolutely exquisitely judged sequence on the infamous penal colony of Robben Island, where Francois imagines Mandela reciting Invictus in his tiny cell, a blink & you'll miss it moment as a tough white bodyguard hurriedly puts his sunglasses on to hide the fact that he's tearing up at his team having reached the final, or gently underscoring the reconciliation theme by crosscutting the climactic match with a black kid outside the stadium slowly edging closer to a group of white cops listening to the match on their car radio, Eastwood makes this kind of ambitious filmmaking, so littered with obvious booby traps look so bloody easy.Granted Invictus is unabashedly feel good but there's nothing wrong with that provided it's as well done as it is here. It's a film that leaves you buzzing & although corny to say it - yep - uplifted. Recommended, but do try & catch it on the biggest screen you can.",5,"Stirring, rousing Eastwood film - one of 2009's best",1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,5696,"['quietly', 'superb', 'film', 'Clint',

1271284,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B002JCSWV6,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","One of the best movies of 2009, ""Invictus,"" written by Anthony Peckham and directed by Clint Eastwood, takes us to a fascinating moment in modern history.It's the mid-1990s; the racist and repressive system known as Apartheid has recently been overturned in South Africa, and former political prisoner Nelson Mandela has just been elected the nation's first black president.  Tensions are running high among the Afrikaners, who fear that the majority blacks will use their new-found power to exact revenge on the white minority.  Many of the blacks, on the other hand, find it difficult and distasteful to work in tandem with a people who had degraded, oppressed and even imprisoned them for so long.Into this quagmire steps Mr. Mandela, a true believer in the power of redemption and reconciliation to change hearts and influence policy, who hits upon a scheme to unite the two factions through their mutual love of rugby, rallying the nation behind the team known as the Springboks, which, for the blacks, once represented all the things they despised about the Apartheid regime.  Against massive odds of both history and human nature, this amazing man manages to heal old wounds and forge a new nation based on equality and respect for all.Derived from the novel ""Playing the Enemy"" by John Carlin, ""Invictus"" (the title of a Victorian poem Mandela uses as a guide for his own life) could easily have been just another self-congratulatory exercise in ""do-gooder"" drama - but its heartfelt honesty, its accomplished direction and its world-class acting make it so much more.  Morgan Freeman gives a towering, yet carefully understated, performance as the near-saintly Mandela, a role he was clearly born to play, bringing true conviction to the moral strength, innate compassion and basic decency of a man who suffered so much at the hands of others, yet who refused to allow personal bitterness and a desire for revenge to determine the course his life - or his nation - would take.  Instead, Mandela, at great personal risk to his own popularity, used his experience to build bridges and to set his nation on a path towards healing that would allow it to take its rightful place in a modern, more enlightened world where every man is equal and where citizens work together for a common good.  Indeed, Mandela is probably the greatest argument for the Great Men Theory of history the past half century has had to offer.And Matt Damon, boasting a flawless South African accent, has probably never been better than he is here, playing Francois Pienaar, the captain of the Springboks, who is so impressed with Mandela's continued faith in the human race despite all he's been through that he rallies his own team members (most of them white) to join with the president in playing for the glory of the new South Africa - an effort that led them to winning the Rugby World Cup in 1995.The beauty of ""Invictus"" is that it doesn't find it necessary to over-dramatize the racial tension or to indulge in ginned-up  melodramatics to get its message across.  The racism here is often of a more subtle kind - a careless word here, a thoughtless put-down there - and the movie does an expert job conveying that fact.Recently, I wrote that I couldn't imagine seeing a more inspiring and uplifting film than ""Pete Seeger: The Power of Song.""  Well, now I've just seen one.  It's called ""Invictus"" - and it is not to be missed.",5,Making the world a better place one rugby match at a time,1281225600,"08 8, 2010",2010,3415,"['One', 'best', 'movies', '2009', 'Invictus', 'written', 'Anthony', 'Peckham', 'directed', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'fascinating', 'moment', 'modern', 'history.It', 'mid-1990s', 'racist', 'repressive', 'system', 'known', 'Apartheid', 'recently', 'been', 'overturned', 'South', 'Africa', 'former', 'political', 'prisoner', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'just', 'been', 'elected', 'nation', 'first', 'black', 'president', 'Tensions', 'are', 'running', 'high', 'Afrikaners', 'who', 'fear', 'majority', 'blacks', 'will', 'use', 'new-found', 'power', 'exact', 'revenge', 'white', 'minority', 'Many', 'blacks', 'other', 'hand', 'find', 'difficult', 'distasteful', 'work', 'tandem', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'degraded', 'oppressed', 'even', 'imprisoned', 'so', 'long.Into', 'quagmire', 'Mr.', 'Mandela', 'true', 'believer', 'power', 'redemption', 'reconciliation', 'change', 'hearts', 'influence', 'policy', 'who', 'scheme', 'unite', 'two', 'factions', 'mutual', 'love', 'rugby', 'rallying', 'nation', 'team', 'known', 'Springboks', 'blacks', 'once', 'represented', 'things', 'despised', 'Apartheid', 'regime', 'Against', 'massive', 'odds', 'history', 'human', 'nature', 'amazing', 'man', 'heal', 'old', 'wounds', 'forge', 'new', 'nation', 'based', 'equality', 'respect', 'all.Derived', 'novel', 'Playing', 'Enemy', 'John', 'Carlin', 'Invictus', 'title', 'Victorian', 'poem', 'Mandela', 'guide', 'own', 'life', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'self-congratulatory', 'exercise', 'do-gooder', 'drama', 'heartfelt', 'honesty', 'accomplished', 'direction', 'world-class', 'acting', 'make', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'towering', 'yet', 'carefully', 'understated', 'performance', 'near-saintly', 'Mandela', 'role', 'was', 'clearly', 'born', 'play', 'bringing', 'true', 'conviction', 'moral', 'strength', 'innate', 'compassion', 'basic', 'decency', 'man', 'who', 'suffered', 'so', 'much', 'hands', 'others', 'who', 'refused', 'allow', 'personal', 'bitterness', 'desire', 'revenge', 'determine', 'course', 'life', 'nation', 'would', 'take', 'Instead', 'Mandela', 'great', 'personal', 'risk', 'own', 'popularity', 'used', 'experience', 'build', 'bridges', 'set', 'nation', 'path', 'healing', 'would', 'allow', 'take', 'rightful', 'place', 'modern', 'more', 'enlightened', 'world', 'where', 'man', 'equal', 'where', 'citizens', 'work', 'together', 'common', 'good', 'Indeed', 'Mandela', 'probably', 'greatest', 'argument', 'Great', 'Men', 'Theory', 'history', 'past', 'half', 'century', 'had', 'offer.And', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'boasting', 'flawless', 'South', 'African', 'accent', 'probably', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'here', 'playing', 'Francois', 'Pienaar', 'captain', 'Springboks', 'who', 'so', 'impressed', 'Mandela', 'continued', 'faith', 'human', 'race', 'been', 'own', 'team', 'members', 'most', 'white', 'join', 'president', 'playing', 'glory', 'new', 'South', 'Africa', 'effort', 'led', 'winning', 'Rugby', 'World', 'Cup', '1995.The', 'beauty', 'Invictus', ""n't"", 'find', 'necessary', 'over-dramatize', 'racial', 'tension', 'indulge', 'ginned-up', 'melodramatics', 'get', 'message', 'racism', 'here', 'often', 'more', 'subtle', 'kind', 'careless', 'word', 'here', 'thoughtless', 'put-down', 'movie', 'expert', 'job', 'conveying', 'fact.Recently', 'wrote', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'seeing', 'more', 'inspiring', 'uplifting', 'film', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'Power', 'Song', 'Well', 'now', ""'ve"", 'just', 'seen', 'one', 'called', 'Invictus', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

I heard of the person frequently and knew that many international celebrities are proud of their association with him. Now I understand why. This man is great, not only for his being jailed for 20+ years against apartheid, but for his character, like a saint, that he not only forgives his enemies for the benefits of his country, but with great wisdom, he unites them. Many reviewers express their frustration when they view it as a sports movie or compare it with the director's previous work. Luckily enough somebody had told me that this is a movie about Mandela and so I could watch it as what it intended to be. Inspirational and motivational! Yet quite entertaining. In short, highly recommended!Remarks:1. This is the first Clint Eastwoord directed movie I ever saw. Nevertheless, I am sure he is a great director in that he had not made any violent scene at all yet I can still feel the stress of a post apartheid South Africa.2.

I learned so much, and was just simply amazed (not even a strong enough word) and blown away with the man, Nelson Mandela. This movie showed beautifully what he was up against trying to bring together a torn country full of hate and bitterness. It looked impossible, but he never lost heart.What was so magnificently shown was the incredible forgiveness that Mandela gave. The movie showed him as a true leader and role model for everyone. It effectively showed what he suffered and lost, and how he was willing to fight if absolutely necessary. But it also showed how he looked for a way through peace whenever it was possible (and when it looked impossible to others). He did all this despite what people thought of him. Even his own family. His amazing ability as a visionary, diplomat and peacemaker was shown so well. I was so blown away by this man that I couldn't stop thinking about it. I ended up doing some research on him to learn more.I gave the movie 4 stars because there are long segments that were quite dull. When the soccer games were shown, they were difficult to follow, and very dull. Even my husband who is a huge sports fan couldn't follow and got really bored.

1271297,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B002JCSWV6,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 1]","I have very little time for politicians, I'm not a fan of rugby, and I know very little about South Africa. However, I do think that Clint Eastwood makes a lot of important films, and I enjoy the acting of Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon. That's why I decided to watch Invictus when it was released on Blu-ray four years ago.Mandela was occasionally in the news during my childhood, but events happening on another continent meant very little to me as a young boy. As an adult, I have come to appreciate people who sacrificed much of their lives in an attempt to change the way people think. If you connected with Steven Spielberg's Lincoln, try to imagine a similar scenario in the modern world.Mandela campaigned against apartheid, and was imprisoned for his actions in 1963. He spent 18 of his 27 years in prison on Robben Island, where he contracted tuberculosis. As I write this review, he's in hospital with pneumonia at the age of 94.Invictus shows some of the challenges faced by Mandela when he became South Africa's first black president in 1994. He defied expectations at every turn. An early scene gives us a clue about the man as he calls together his staff. Some of them are white, and expecting to be fired, but Mandela urges them to stay and continue to serve their country. He wants to forgive those who imprisoned him, and those who hate black South Africans. He realized that he was in a position to lead by example, and that it wasn't the time to settle old scores. Freeman's portrayal provides insight into Mandela's character, and shows us why he was loved by the people with whom he interacted.Racism is one of the most dangerous things in existence, and I believe that it will always be with us in some form. There is no logic in hating someone because of their color or origin, but we are still surrounded by people who do just that. I think it's incredibly ignorant to continue to hold such beliefs in modern society, but I won't turn this review into a debate about racism. I mention it because it's important to frame the story, and appreciate what Mandela was trying to do.So why is rugby an integral part of the story?When Mandela took office, South Africa had already been chosen to host the rugby world cup a year later. Mandela decided to use the occasion to help to unite South Africans in a common cause. Rugby had always been a game revered by white South Africans, while black South Africans preferred soccer. In fact, the black population frequently cheered for whichever team was playing their national team as a form of protest. Overcoming that level of hatred proved to be quite a challenge.Matt Damon plays South African Springbok captain, Francois Pienaar. He leads a team that is suffering from lack of belief in its own ability. There's a definite parallel between Mandela's efforts to unite the country, and Pienaar's task of uniting his team, the fans, and the media. Mandela meets him to discuss the importance of performing well in the world cup, and the two talk about leadership techniques.Invictus is an engaging story which appeals as a historical drama more than a movie about sports. You don't need to know anything about rugby in order to appreciate the story. Eastwood has constructed a film that deals with the weighty subject matter in a way that we can all understand. Freeman was deservedly nominated for his performance, and Damon is convincing as a rugby player.Films like this may be considered too idealistic by many, but it works for me. I realize that uniting a country is more difficult than the events portrayed on the screen over the course of two hours. What Invictus does is encourage me to think beyond my immediate surroundings, and appreciate some of the things faced by people living in other countries. It's not the best film ever made about politics or sports, but it's definitely worth your time if you want to broaden your horizons.",4,"A film about hope, perseverance, and overcoming impossible odds",1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,3910,"['have', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'politicians', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'rugby', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'South', 'Africa', 'However', 'do', 'think', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'lot', 'important', 'films', 'enjoy', 'acting', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'why', 'decided', 'watch', 'Invictus', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'Blu-ray', 'four', 'years', 'ago.Mandela', 'was', 'occasionally', 'news', 'childhood', 'events', 'happening', 'continent', 'meant', 'very', 'little', 'young', 'boy', 'adult', 'have', 'come', 'appreciate', 'people', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'much', 'lives', 'attempt', 'change', 'way', 'people', 'think', 'connected', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Lincoln', 'try', 'imagine', 'similar', 'scenario', 'modern', 'world.Mandela', 'campaigned', 'apartheid', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'actions', '1963', 'spent', '18', '27', 'years', 'prison', 'Robben', 'Island', 'where', 'contracted', 'tuberculosis', 'write', 'review', 'hospital', 'pneumonia', 'age', '94.Invictus', 'shows', 'challenges', 'faced', 'Mandela', 'when', 'became', 'South', 'Africa', 'first', 'black', 'president', '1994', 'defied', 'expectations', 'turn', 'early', 'scene', 'clue', 'man', 'together', 'staff', 'are', 'white', 'expecting', 'be', 'fired', 'Mandela', 'stay', 'continue', 'serve', 'country', 'forgive', 'who', 'imprisoned', 'who', 'hate', 'black', 'South', 'Africans', 'realized', 'was', 'position', 'lead', 'example', 'was', ""n't"", 'time', 'settle', 'old', 'scores', 'Freeman', 'portrayal', 'insight', 'Mandela', 'character', 'why', 'was', 'loved', 'people', 'whom', 'interacted.Racism', 'one', 'most', 'dangerous', 'things', 'existence', 'believe', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'form', 'logic', 'hating', 'someone', 'color', 'origin', 'are', 'still', 'surrounded', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'just', 'think', 'incredibly', 'ignorant', 'continue', 'hold', 'such', 'beliefs', 'modern', 'society', 'wo', ""n't"", 'turn', 'review', 'debate', 'racism', 'mention', 'important', 'frame', 'story', 'appreciate', 'what', 'Mandela', 'was', 'trying', 'do.So', 'why', 'rugby', 'integral', 'part', 'story', 'When', 'Mandela', 'took', 'office', 'South', 'Africa', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'chosen', 'host', 'rugby', 'world', 'cup', 'year', 'later', 'Mandela', 'decided', 'use', 'occasion', 'help', 'unite', 'South', 'Africans', 'common', 'cause', 'Rugby', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'game', 'revered', 'white', 'South', 'Africans', 'black', 'South', 'Africans', 'preferred', 'soccer', 'fact', 'black', 'population', 'frequently', 'cheered', 'whichever', 'team', 'was', 'playing', 'national', 'team', 'form', 'protest', 'Overcoming', 'level', 'hatred', 'proved', 'be', 'quite', 'challenge.Matt', 'Damon', 'South', 'African', 'Springbok', 'captain', 'Francois', 'Pienaar', 'team', 'suffering', 'lack', 'belief', 'own', 'ability', 'definite', 'parallel', 'Mandela', 'efforts', 'unite', 'country', 'Pienaar', 'task', 'uniting', 'team', 'fans', 'media', 'Mandela', 'discuss', 'importance', 'performing', 'well', 'world', 'cup', 'two', 'talk', 'leadership', 'techniques.Invictus', 'engaging', 'story', 'appeals', 'historical', 'drama', 'more', 'movie', 'sports', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'anything', 'rugby', 'order', 'appreciate', 'story', 'Eastwood', 'constructed', 'film', 'weighty', 'subject', 'matter', 'way', 'can', 'understand', 'Freeman', 'was', 'deservedly', 'nominated', 'performance', 'Damon', 'convincing', 'rugby', 'player.Films', 'may', 'be', 'considered', 'too', 'idealistic', 'many', 'realize', 'uniting', 'country', 'more', 'difficult', 'events', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'course', 'two', 'hours', 'What', 'Invictus', 'encourage', 'think', 'immediate', 'surroundings', 'appreciate', 'things', 'faced', 'people', 'living', 'other', 'countries', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'politics', 'sports', 'definitely', 'worth', 'time', 'want', 'broaden', 'horizons']",N/A

1271300,A3RACR5HAC8LPN,B002JCSWV6,"Tara Lawrence-Stuart ""not carmen in sandiego""","[5, 5]","Leaving the movie description to other more able reviewers, I won't repeat anything.  Let me just say I am seeing it for about the fifth or sixth time and my eyes still well with tears of emotion when I see that troubled nation magically changing by the sheer will of the great statesman Nelson Mandela. He managed to draw all peoples together and change the flag and the nation to multi-color, and he managed to win the Springboks over before they won the 1995 World Cup. If I could be granted a wish to have been anywhere in the past 20 years, it would be attending that great game in Ellis Stadium in Johannesburg, the last bastion of Afrikanerdom, just to watch that game, the mighty Springboks versus the feared New Zealand All-Blacks (so named after the color of their uniforms). I'd see the old Boer ""bitter-ender"" descendants of hard-line Afrikaner voortrekkers playing rugby and fathers and sons of apartheid hugging and being hugged by peoples of all colors and persuasions during and after the game when their countrymen won the World Cup. I'd hear people of all tribes, colors, and religions cheering and shouting Mandela's name and see that game. I'd hear alack, white, and every color of men, women, and children sing ""Nkosi Sikelele' iAfrica"", the cherished song of black freedom. The film is true to life by director Clint Eastwood. But oh to be in old J'burg just to see the Springboks win the World Cup Rugby and the great president Mandela in his Springbok jersey and cap, smiling from ear to ear, as he presented the World Cup to the Captain of the Springboks, which by his sheer force of will he made the whole country's team, no longer exclusive to Afrikaners.Immediately after seeing this movie I googled Francois Pienaar and got him on You-Tube talking to and about Mandela and ended up buying the book ""Playing the Enemy"", by John Carlin, which moved me even more. It reassured me of the authenticity of the film. The 'Boks winning that day was the crowning moment for South Africa not just in sporting events but the culmination and beginning of Mandela's ""One Team, One Country"" idea which both shocked, surprised, and pleased all citizens (mostly themselves) by their own reactions.President Nelson Mandela is played most ably by Morgan Freeman,and in voice, accent, and and gesture--he is  authentically Mandela). Francois Pienaar, the Afrikaans Captain of the Springboks is played by Matt Damon (of Bourne fame) with a very authentic Afrikaans accent and a fierce rugby-playing skill, though only 5'11"" not 6'4"" is very believable and played a strong Captain. He was big in soul and a convincing Captain and you could see Damon was playing great rugby. I'am sure the real Pienaar was pleased. The first meeting between Pienaar and Mandela, like everything in the film, is based on fact. I had no inkling that these incidents had ever occurred. How I managed to miss this is beyond someone who has been following South African politics and reading all she could since the mid-sixties. But this film is about more than a game, it is the magic of Mandela and his shrewd and wise perception that sports can be a uniting force, and he played it for all it was worth, and the beginning of a great, united South Africa came to be, and at a very pivotal point in South Africa's history.Of course there is much more than the Springboks game involved in this film. As in real life, there was more to Mandela's presidency ending apartheid, and his most herculean task was to draw all peoples together in a spirit of forgiveness, redemption, and the Afrikaner Springboks represented all Afrikaners in this effort, and that was key in succeeding.  Mandela believes that sometimes in order to create a new nation people have to work with people they don't like, or even trust!In the film, Mandela gives a poem to the Springbok Captain.

Let's look at WHAT HE ACTUALLY accomplished:Apart from having a likeable personality, he achieved next to nothing in his relatively short political career which saw South Africa rapidly decline to the status of the world's most violent and crime-ridden country, and, to add to the confusion, his greatest friends are communists and dictators like Fidel Castro, Moammar Qaddafi, Yasser Arafat and Saddam Hussein. His ex-wife Winnie Mandela, whom he quickly jettisoned when it became clear she was a considerable embarassment to his political career, is a self-confessed advocate of terrorism and violence and has even committed murder. It was only after irrefutable eye-witnesses offered proof that his wife ""Winnie"" had found a 14 year-old son of a political (black) enemy, had him cuffed and a tire placed around him, filled the tire with gasoline and set him ablaze that it was deemed 'time to divorce Winnie...'In his public statements and speeches Mandela is always critical of the democratic countries of the west, but has nothing but praise for the remaining communist dictatorships of the world. He condemns mistakes and controversial policies of the west, but refuses to publicly condemn the genocides and brutal repression of current or former communist countries; he is supposedly a ""champion of freedom and democracy"", the ""hero of oppressed people everywhere"" but considers dictatorships like Cuba and Libya shining beacons of freedom and justice...While in America Mandela also made public statements that amounted to support for violence and terrorism in the furtherance of political aims. In a speech in Harlem, referring to four Puerto Rican terrorists who shot and wounded five US Congressmen in 1954, he said:We support the cause of anyone who is fighting for self-determination, and our attitude is the same, no matter who it is. I would be honored to sit on the platform with the four comrades you refer to.Suitable ""comrades"" for Mandela indeed.Apartheid was and is wrong, but the fact is the post-Apartheid governments have been nothing but corrupt embarrassments, destroying the country.

1271309,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002JCSWV6,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","""Invictus,"" Clint Eastwood's latest film as director, is about the 1995 Rugby World Cup'held in South Africa, but it is not just about the sports or this particular event. The film is really about leadership in a divided country, represented by Nelson Mandela's decision to support the Springboks, the South African national rugby team. As far as the against-the-odds storyline goes, ""Invictus"" feels a little predictable. What is great about the film is that Eastwood has created an insightful portrait of a national leader without making it preachy.Morgan Freeman is perfectly cast as Nelson Mandela, who was elected President of South Africa in 1994. He is aware that this is a most difficult task and knows any hasty or premature decision would lead the nation torn apart into confusion. Changing the national rugby team's color and name could result in more social tension, so the president shows up himself in a meeting of the South African Sports Committee, not to order, but to convince.One day Nelson Mandela invites the rugby team's captain Franois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to his office. His intention is too clear though he never says it aloud. He chose the Springboks as a symbol for the country's unity. That means the national team, then not a very strong club, must win the World Cup. Everyone thought it was impossible. Of course, he knows better.Maybe ""Invictus"" is not what you are looking for. As a rugby film, the film falls short of excitement that sports film provide, as the rugby scenes (especially the final game) often emphasizes the reactions of the audiences, not the game itself. As a bio-pic ""Invictus"" depicts mostly the short period after Nelson Mandela took office as president in 1994. His private life and Robben Island prison are only briefly shown.After all, ""Invictus"" belongs to Morgan Freeman, who quietly rules the screen with his presence.

1271311,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002JCSWV6,Turfseer,"[9, 15]","Note: This review may contains spoilers--'Invictus' is designed to be a 'feel-good' movie about relationships between blacks and whites. The setting is South Africa beginning with the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in 1990 and his subsequent ascent to the South African presidency a short time later. Morgan Freeman does a great job in 'channeling' the great man and you really feel as if you're watching Mandela himself. When the Oscars come up, Freeman has a very good shot at copping the Oscar for Best Actor.Clint Eastwood's strategy is to depict Nelson Mandela's program for racial reconciliation through the narrow prism of International Rugby. While there are a few interesting glimpses of Mandela interacting with his main assistant and some of his counselors, little of his personal life is shown (there is a brief scene where he's depicted as being alienated from his daughter who regards him as something of a sell-out). By the second half, Mandela is reduced to being basically a cheerleader for the South African Rugby team. Still, the sheer humanity of Mandela is always at the forefront, with his emphasis on forgiveness.I liked the first half of Invictus better than the second. There's a good scene where Mandela tries to persuade a group of his constituents (a Sports Federation) not to disenfranchise the rugby team. Mandela, in Christ-like fashion, urges the crowd to 'turn the other cheek' and support the team despite their identification of the white players with the apartheid era. Despite their initial rejection, blacks in South Africa gradually come to root for the team. One way they're won over is after Mandela asks the team to tour the shanty towns and introduce rugby to poor black children. It helps that there's one black player on the team who becomes a national figure. But when Mandela visits the team before a big game and congratulates each player individually, he's sending a signal that he's for whites as much as blacks. And the white players (who are initially depicted as being quite alienated and angry after Mandela becomes President) gradually soften up too: in one poignant scene, they go on a tour of the prison where Mandela was held for 27 years. Later they're not afraid to sing the new South African anthem with their black countrymen.Less successful are the scenes involving Mandela's bodyguards. The tension between the black and white bodyguards at the beginning is quite understandable. But virtually none of the characters are ever fleshed out. It takes a team victory in the Rugby World Cup to get them all hugging one another. But the camaraderie seems quite superficial. One wonders if everyone will be so touchy-feeley once all the excitement has worn off.Invictus completely loses steam in the second half. There's virtually no suspense since the film's outcome is a forgone conclusion. What's worse is that the idea of an antagonist is lost as the film plods along. The tension between blacks and whites is palpable at the beginning but as the focus shifts to the rugby team itself, where is the conflict? Good movies have a moment where the protagonist faces a moment of crisis leading to a 'dark moment of the soul'. The best Invictus offers us is when Mandela collapses after being overworked. It's not enough!The awkwardness of the entire screenplay is embodied in the relationship between the team captain, Francois Pienaar, played by Matt Damon and Mandela. They have one scene together when Mandela invites Pinaar to tea. We find out next to nothing about Pienaar but maybe that's because there's not a lot to find out. Damon runs around a lot on the field but only briefly confronts his teammates who are initially reluctant to embrace Mandela's plan for reconciliation. Again, where is the conflict?As an American who is unfamiliar with the rules of rugby, I was bored watching scene after scene of grown men groping one another without protective equipment. Since Eastwood really had no exciting climax to offer, he pads the last twenty minutes of the film with what I would term an extended 'highlight reel'. For rugby aficionados, this might prove to be orgasmic. As for ignorant Americans such as myself, I never thought I'd be desperate to tune into next Sunday's football game so quickly.Some have claimed that Invictus is just another film about race relations from the white man's perspective. Maybe so but I prefer to view it as primarily a mediocre sports film. On the plus side, if one wishes to feel good without thinking too hard, then one can indulge oneself in this rather superficial glimpse of racial harmony. While Invictus fails in the drama department, Morgan Freeman's performance as the great and inspiring Mandela will make you look at race relations from the glass being half full and not half empty.",2,'Feel-good' race relations flick or extended rugby highlight reel?

1271314,A35V32HZEGZH04,B002JCSWV6,"W. Easley ""Opa""","[3, 3]","Invictus is a movie that presents two interwoven themes: The beginnings of the reign of Nelson Mandela as President of South Africa, and the story of the rugby World Cup of 1995.  The pace is rapid and the tone tense, as Mandela has inherited a country burning with racial tension and on the edge of civil war.Nelson Mandela, played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman, begins his attack on his nation's problems his first day.  His message is clear.  South Africa is one nation, one people, who must work together for the good of the country.  As Mandela arrived for his first day, the government employees of the previous administration were packing to leave.  Mandela asked them to stay and help the country heal.  This set the tone of his plan.Meanwhile, the Springboks, the South African national Rugby team was adrift, not knowing their fate.  Mandela sought out the team captain Francois Pienaar, (superbly  played by Matt Damon) to ask his help building a first rate world cup team.  A surprised Pienaar agrees.Mandela's focus upon the national rugby team projects a message of reconciliation for the nation of South Africa.  Mandela asks his people to follow that model.  Mandela sets the example by learning the names and backgrounds of every member of the rugby team.  He visits some practices, tells the team that the entire nation supports them, then approaches each man, calls him by name and thanks him for his help.The title of the film ""Invictus"" is taken from a poem by William Ernest Henley.  The lines of the poem inspired Nelson Mandela when he was in prison for 27 years.  Several of the verses relate to the film.Beyond this place of wrath and tearsLooms but the Horror of the shade,And yet the menace of the yearsFinds, and shall find, me unafraid.It matters not how strait the gate,How charged with punishments the scroll.I am the master of my fate:I am the captain of my soul.""Invictus"" is an excellent movie that is well directed and well acted.  It presents world events that most Americans never witness.

1271315,A25S4Q7KSTEW02,B002JCSWV6,W. Rodick,"[0, 0]","This particular dvd rental lay on my sofa table for a long time before deciding to watch it. Although I did not know the story and don't know very much about rugby, I felt as though it would be somewhat predictable. Just another sports film. Wrong.The backdrop of regime change is well shown as well as being well told. When the new President Mandela chooses his body guards it serves as an illustration of how he wants South Africa to be. Personal conflicts have to be overcome. They are white because they are experienced, they are black because they are good at their job but few in number.The effects of prolonged imprisonment are also shown. The genius of a man determined to listen and to learn in order to realise his own aims is breathtaking at times. There is nothing like an open mind to undermine those who fail to think.The character of the glorious rugby captain is very well played, the inspiration not just from innate leadership skills but also the ability to read a game at any given moment came through in Matt Damon's performance. And the parallels with running a country are a fascinating overlap. Invictus is Nelson Mandela's story. His foresight, his inspiration; his will to win. Morgan Freeman's portrayal is convincing.Clint Eastwood's direction is assured, the game of rugby did not totally depend on thorough knowledge of the rules. Whether the scrums are as non verbal as shown in the film I would doubt somehow. But the idea of winning, of men winning is something to be shared by many. Perhaps this film is not for wallflowers?Of course such clarity of purpose comes at a cost. And the cost of family affection seems to be borne heavily on the free Mr Mandela. Freedom without responsibility is quickly mutated into greed. And with greed comes isolation. Desperation. Despair.The poem which seems to have lifted our incarcerated hero is overblown, heightened emotional rhetoric about being the master of your soul and master of your fate. Why do I get the feeling that he understood the English with this poem?

1271317,AP3B615GM191G,B002JCSWV6,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[11, 16]","Whenever I see the name ""Clint Eastwood"" associated with a new moving coming to theaters, I automatically think of such incredible films as Million Dollar Baby, Changeling, and Gran Torino.  Perhaps I am just spoiled by Eastwood's spotless track record, but that is the reality of the situation.  With that in mind, Invictus does not live up to the billing...but it still is a very honorable effort.Basically, the film takes place primarily in the country of South Africa, where Nelson Mandela (played superbly by Morgan Freeman) has come to power and is striving to bridge the gap between blacks and whites after decades of apartheid rule.  Mandela seizes upon the country's terrible rugby team, stocked primarily by high-brow, burly white men, as a symbol of unity for the country.  He tabs Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to captain the team and make them respectable (if not a whole lot more) heading into the World Cup.  The rest, as they say, is history.Now, I can't say that this film was outright bad in any way.  The race-relations message is one that resonates, the rugby team is certainly inspirational, and the acting is pretty good as well, led by the remarkable Freeman as one of the world's most storied leaders.  Yet, unlike ""Torino"" or ""Baby"", the word I would use to describe this film is ""understated"".  Instead of walloping viewers over the head with such heavy topics as euthanasia, religion, or death, in this effort Eastwood takes a much more low-key approach.  There is drama, yes, and plenty of inspiration, but it just doesn't feel as epic as it could have been.  Whether this was Eastwood trying to ""follow the facts"" as much as possible, or the real-life story just not providing the high drama of a fully scripted film, I'm not sure.Thus, if you are heading to the theater expecting utter greatness like I was, you will likely leave disappointed.  However, if the topics/events/times in the film are of significant personal or cultural importance to you, then Invictus will automatically garner a five-star rating for its factual portrayal of the events that transpired.",3,Don't Expect Past Eastwood Greatness...But Still Okay,1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,2097,"['Whenever', 'see', 'name', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'associated', 'new', 'moving', 'coming', 'theaters', 'automatically', 'think', 'such', 'incredible', 'films', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Changeling', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'just', 'spoiled', 'Eastwood', 'spotless', 'track', 'record', 'reality', 'situation', 'mind', 'Invictus', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'billing', 'still', 'very', 'honorable', 'effort.Basically', 'film', 'place', 'primarily', 'country', 'South', 'Africa', 'where', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'played', 'superbly', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'come', 'power', 'striving', 'bridge', 'gap', 'blacks', 'whites', 'decades', 'apartheid', 'rule', 'Mandela', 'country', 'terrible', 'rugby', 'team', 'stocked', 'primarily', 'high-brow', 'burly', 'white', 'men', 'symbol', 'unity', 'country', 'tabs', 'Francois', 'Pienaar', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'captain', 'team', 'make', 'respectable', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'heading', 'World', 'Cup', 'rest', 'say', 'history.Now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'was', 'outright', 'bad', 'way', 'race-relations', 'message', 'one', 'rugby', 'team', 'certainly', 'inspirational', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'led', 'remarkable', 'Freeman', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'storied', 'leaders', 'Torino', 'Baby', 'word', 'would', 'use', 'describe', 'film', 'understated', 'Instead', 'walloping', 'viewers', 'head', 'such', 'heavy', 'topics', 'euthanasia', 'religion', 'death', 'effort', 'Eastwood', 'much', 'more', 'low-key', 'approach', 'drama', 'yes', 'plenty', 'inspiration', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'as', 'epic', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'Eastwood', 'trying', 'follow', 'facts', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'real-life', 'story', 'just', 'not', 'providing', 'high', 'drama', 'fully', 'scripted', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure.Thus', 'are', 'heading', 'theater', 'expecting', 'utter', 'greatness', 'was', 'will', 'likely', 'leave', 'disappointed', 'However', 'topics/events/times', 'film', 'are', 'significant', 'personal', 'cultural', 'importance', 'then', 'Invictus', 'will', 'automatically', 'garner', 'five-star', 'rating', 'factual', 'portrayal', 'events', 'transpired']",N/A
