It isn't as funny as Eating Out 2, 3, and 4, and that probably has something to do with Mink Stole and Rebbekah Kochan being reduced to cameos. Kochan also was only in one scene in Eating Out: Drama Camp. I don't know why this is, since the Eating Out movies are probably the most popular that she has appeared in. And both her and the writers and directors of these movies surely know what a fan base she and her character of Tiffani have.

If you're going to do it, do it, don't just fiddle with tease-angles and quick shots...Unfortunately, there are also as many wince inducing moments in all of these films as there are in any Ferrell/Sandler work.  The wincing here produced by a story line that is so juvenile that [admittedly very young] gay men sound like teenage girls; all they think about, talk about, is boys.  And catty talk at that.&#34;Open Weekend&#34; picks up where the considerably inferior &#34;Drama Camp&#34; leaves off (hey, there's inexpensive wine, cheap wine, and then there's Two Buck Chuck).  The winners there get a weekend in Palm Springs, and our two heroes, who were a couple but have now broken up, find themselves in a Palm Springs gay-tel, where Mike's new love tells him they should have &#34;just one&#34; open weekend, and trick about.  Speaking from experience, there is no such thing as &#34;just one&#34; open weekend, either you work for monogamy or you have your extracurricular adventures and watch your relationship suffer.  But, in the middle of the film, it's announced that Sacramento has created a legal loophole for gay marriage, a one hour &#34;get hitched&#34; window and so everyone flocks to a nearby gay-tel to tie the knot, and Mike has to make a decision...  Along the way there's all sorts of gay fun, washboard abs, full frontals, and even a sort of straight menage between a poor virgin girl, and a distinctly not virgin tranny, and a gay-cute ostensible straight bartender at the gay-tel...Sigh.  Same place, same faces, thirty years on.  Nothing makes one feel so old.  On the other hand, we could be dead, like a lot of guys who would have been our age, so quit whining!Like I said:  Light entertainment, soft porn sensibilities; occasional full frontal male nudity, idiotic story, lots of wince inducing moments.

Then another man, Piel (Chris Puckett), walks in to use the urinal to the right. Piel looks at Benji down there and then eventually Benji looks at him down there. Piel then touches Benji's arm to move his hand down to his. Then Zach (Chris Salvatore) walks in to use the urinal to the left. Benji and Piel stop and continue urinating. Then Piel and Benji touch each other again. Zack asks Benji what he is doing. Benji replies, ""Having fun"". and to ""Join in"". Benji kisses Zack. Piel takes his shirt off and then kisses Benji and takes his shirt off. A blond man walks in and joins them. Three more men walk in and join them, then two more and three more men walk in and all men are kissing each other.Benji snaps his fingers at Zack and the daydream is over. Benji and Zack are still at the urinal.They have won a free vacation to a gay resort in Palm Springs. Benji wants this to be an open weekend, but Zack is nervous and he doesn't want to loose Benji.

It uses goofy and quirky situations to let us see how jealousy, regret, politics, social expectations, and Speedos can shape how we act, and how what we get in life results from how we deal with those things.  It all takes place at a gay resort, and the bodies around the pool reflect those in the ads for gay cruises - the world does not seem to include those folks as out-of-shape or middle-aged as me.

Instead, I was surprised by a campy exploration of gay monogamy and the relation to the marriage movement.

I have to give the series kudos for making it this far by phasing out old characters, hanging on to treasured ones, and breathing new life into the proceedings with new faces. The series has managed to sustain itself without losing its gay edge. As with the earlier films, this one mirrors the gay culture & goings-on with the plot & character soul-searching. New couple Zack & Benji (you have to watch ""Drama Camp"" to get the dish on why they're together) decide to open up their relationship by vacationing in an exclusive Palm Springs gay inn in which ""there are hot guys everywhere"". Actually, it's Benji who's more enthused; Zack is in doubt about the whole thing, which sets the stage for future conflicts. They also bring transexual Lily (from DC) along, who experiences romantic bumps in the road as well. Before you can say ""it's a small world"", Zack's ex Casey shows up with ditzy gal pal Penny (also from DC) as ""boyfriend-oriented"" Casey uncomfortably stumbles through a buffet of ready-to-play guys. Surprise...he runs into an old HS classmate who's now gay..and definitely morphed into a hunk! When Zack & Casey bump into each other, Casey doesn't want to come off looking pathetic, so he talks a reluctant Peter (the HS hunk) to pose as his new boyfriend (although Peter came there to play around). And so, TOW remains faithful to the running theme of the series: Gays play head games with each other with deceptions, teasing, jealousy, and dodging their true feelings about each other until the truth becomes glaringly clear. For those who were disappointed in Zack & Casey's breakup in DC, let me just say that one character wakes up at the last minute (right before he's about to ""marry"" another, no less..the plot tells us there's a ""loophole"" window of about one hour for same-sex marriages) to realize what a good thing he had with his ex. So the message here, ultimately, is: Yes, gay men love to play around. Yes, they can fall in & out of love. Yes, they're able to make good moral choices. And yes, love can mend those seeking happiness.And of course, there's the oh-so-brief cameos from the wonderful actresses Mink Stole & Rebecca Kochan as, respectively, Casey's Aunt & Tiffani. Lastly, the series wouldn't be the same without at least one scorching gay love scene; this one has what has to be the steamiest four-way gay kiss that kicks off some even steamier bedroom antics.I'm happy to say that the ""Eating Out"" series is alive & well.

1514977,A224BKBLXVA859,B006GGRE9M,Rocky Sunico,"[1, 1]","Now a part of me is still annoyed that this movie franchise has transitioned from starting with a clever premise (the whole straight guy pretending to be queer, etc) to have degenerated into just lying. And we seem to be stuck with the cast of the third movie in all subsequent sequels, which probably isn't all that bad but some of the plot twists are starting to lose coherence. And while I appreciate the relative sense of continuity offered by having the same core actors in the subsequent sequels, it still doesn't guarantee good storytelling.And maybe this has to do with the fact I'm personally against open relationships since it leads to too much trouble. But that's a personal opinion outside of my review of this movie. At least that's what I keep reminding myself.Now the movie follows two main tracks. On the one hand we have the ex-lovers trying to pretend everything is okay with their respective partners (of sorts). And this involves the usual instances of one spotting the the other guy's partner is seemingly cheating with other guys when in fact it's part of the open relationship or the fact that he's not actually in a relationship - you should know which one is which. On the other hand, we have the two girls running after the one straight guy in the resort, this being the waiter Luis (Alvaro Orlando). And naturally Luis is heavily flirting with both ladies.Credit where credit is due, most of the guys are definitely hot in this movie. I know I already said this as part of my introduction for this review, but I'll say it again. I can definitely see how the likes of Aaron Milo and Michael Vera are bound to meet the physical standards of most gay guys with slightly hairier Chris Salvatore and highly twinky Daniel Skelton fleshing out the outliers of the taste range. To each his own, I suppose. But I fear that they don't contribute all that much to the overall narrative beyond that function of eye candy.And the overall story is just, well, blah, for lack of a better term. I don't see what meaningful fulfillment the characters end up with by the time of the resolution of the movie's various plot threads. And quite frankly, I feel that we end up simply changing the sequence of partners around and see who comes out of this particular merry-go-round. I suppose it can't be helped, I suppose.

What happens here is that Zack (Chris Salvatore with eyebrows that Captain Scarlett would have been proud of) has won a weekend holiday to a gay resort in Pam Beach. He is with new boyfriend Benji (Aaron Milo) who wants to make a political statement by being open in their relationship; just for the weekend mind. Whilst Zack has some issues he feels unable to articulate them.Then we have the return of Casey (Daniel Skelton a regular of these films) who is also Zacks' ex. He is there with his fagghagg Penny (played dumb and straight by Harmony Santana. And needs a fake b/f to not make Zack feel sorry for him.Well the rest of the plot flits as usual around gay encounters, jealousies and loads of singular entendres plus a lot of gross out squelch humour.Whilst there is nothing here that is ground breaking there are a few good laughs and a teensy bit of moralising, but this was never meant to be an in depth critique of gay life style, so you pretty much get what you were promised. Some have commented that the `Eating Out' franchise is getting a bit stale (awful pun - sorry) but it is always a good hour and a half of cute guys, mild dilemmas and a few laughs so I was not at all disappointed, but I also would be hard pushed to watch it twice, so was glad I went for the rental option. I am being generous with the 4 star rating but that is because as I said it achieves what it sets out to do with all of its expected limitations intact.Overall then the team have made another reasonably good, if formulaic soft gay comedy and if that is your bag then you will not be disappointed, and the acting is all above average, but no award nominations are expected and I do feel we may have run the course, but if there is a number 6 then I just know I will get around to seeing it.",4,May Require a Doggy Bag,1338854400,"06 5, 2012",2012,1927,"['Yes', 'instalment', 'numero', 'five', 'gay', 'comedy', 'franchise', 'have', 'seen', 'others', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'format', 'What', 'here', 'Zack', 'Chris', 'Salvatore', 'eyebrows', 'Captain', 'Scarlett', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'proud', 'won', 'weekend', 'holiday', 'gay', 'resort', 'Pam', 'Beach', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Benji', 'Aaron', 'Milo', 'who', 'make', 'political', 'statement', 'being', 'open', 'relationship', 'just', 'weekend', 'mind', 'Whilst', 'Zack', 'issues', 'unable', 'articulate', 'them.Then', 'have', 'return', 'Casey', 'Daniel', 'Skelton', 'regular', 'films', 'who', 'also', 'Zacks', 'ex', 'there', 'fagghagg', 'Penny', 'played', 'dumb', 'straight', 'Harmony', 'Santana', 'fake', 'b/f', 'not', 'make', 'Zack', 'feel', 'sorry', 'rest', 'plot', 'flits', 'usual', 'gay', 'encounters', 'jealousies', 'loads', 'singular', 'entendres', 'lot', 'gross', 'squelch', 'humour.Whilst', 'nothing', 'here', 'ground', 'breaking', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'teensy', 'bit', 'moralising', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'depth', 'critique', 'gay', 'life', 'style', 'pretty', 'much', 'get', 'what', 'were', 'promised', 'have', 'commented', 'Eating', 'Out', 'franchise', 'getting', 'bit', 'stale', 'awful', 'pun', 'sorry', 'always', 'good', 'hour', 'half', 'cute', 'guys', 'mild', 'dilemmas', 'few', 'laughs', 'so', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'also', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pushed', 'watch', 'twice', 'so', 'was', 'glad', 'went', 'rental', 'option', 'am', 'being', 'generous', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'said', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'expected', 'limitations', 'intact.Overall', 'then', 'team', 'have', 'made', 'reasonably', 'good', 'formulaic', 'soft', 'gay', 'comedy', 'bag', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'acting', 'above', 'average', 'award', 'nominations', 'are', 'expected', 'do', 'feel', 'may', 'have', 'run', 'course', 'number', '6', 'then', 'just', 'know', 'will', 'get', 'seeing']",Eating Out: The Open Weekend
