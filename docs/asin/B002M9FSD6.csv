1277974,A1NOLEWY3EBW01,B002M9FSD6,683,"[1, 3]","""Deadline"" is a really bad movie. One of the last films of Brittany Murphy's career really sucked. One thing I noticed about this movie is that she looked like a drug addict or a really sick person in it, so you could tell that she was in bad health. The plotline was pretty good and it seems like a movie that would have a couple good scares, but it's really nothing. You get excited for nothing. It's a straight-to-DVD movie, so you can't really expect anything great in the first place, but this really just wasn't good. Nothing really creepy happens until about 30 minutes, and the scares are so minimal, and not in a good way. It might as well be a PG movie. The plotline suddenly grows boring as the story of the couple who used to live there climaxes. Near the end, you're basically still bored because it becomes really predictable and the ending confused me for a bit after I saw it, although I did get the whole ending later. You have to think about it a bit afterwards, and that's the only good thing about.

1277975,AV30RYVPJJJ34,B002M9FSD6,Alexander Stephen Brown,"[12, 13]","I didn't go into this movie expecting much considering the cover and it seemed the same as a million other ghost movies I have seen in the past 10 years. Throughout viewing this movie I was dissappointed and entralled.Brittany Murphy plays as a screenwriter who has just moved into a creepy, old mansion to complete her new script. The movie is filled with odd sounds and bumps in the night, which was glorified in the original Shirley Jackson classic, ""The Haunting"".About less than midway in the film Murphy finds a collection of home videos of the previous owners. Of course she watches her find and becomes obsessed. On tape is the documentation of a disgruntled married couple, played by Thora Birch and Marc Blucas. Quickly, she discovers there are frightening similarities between Thora and herself. Brittany discovers later that Thora is murdered and her ghost still haunts the estate.At first, this movie moves like an Asian horror film, its creepy and almost poetic with its style, however, theres only one problem. There is a scene where Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata is playing, Murphy follows the music and sees dead Thora Birch playing the piano, instead of Birch slowly turning to face Murphy the scene becomes loud and obnoxious with poor cgi effects. The result was a cheap scare that lacked a jump. In this one specific scene I have listed two facts that annoyed me. 1. The director went for a poor scare tactic vs. the ghost slowly turning and facing Murphy. 2. PLEASE FORGET CGI WHEN SOMETHING IS SIMPLE *as in Thora's deathly makeup* BE CREATIVE AND USE OLD SCHOOL EFECTS! If Dick Smith could shock millions with makeup and latex what is stopping Hollywood now?Instead of giving up on the movie, I watched it till the end and the twist was redeeming. I snagged this in the $5 bend at Walmart and feel it was worth that amount of money. This movie is rated R, which I believe is a bogus rating, this is clearly no worse than a PG-13 rated film. This movie is without gore or any major or minor scare factors, but it is an interesting watch. Out of a scale of 1 to 10, I rate it a 6 1/2. The only thing that prevented the movie from reaching a higher number is the Moonlight Sonata scene that frustrated me.",3,Decent but Flawed,1271203200,"04 14, 2010",2010,2225,"['did', ""n't"", 'go', 'movie', 'expecting', 'much', 'considering', 'cover', 'seemed', 'same', 'million', 'other', 'ghost', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'past', '10', 'years', 'viewing', 'movie', 'was', 'dissappointed', 'entralled.Brittany', 'Murphy', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'just', 'moved', 'creepy', 'old', 'mansion', 'complete', 'new', 'script', 'movie', 'filled', 'odd', 'sounds', 'bumps', 'night', 'was', 'glorified', 'original', 'Shirley', 'Jackson', 'classic', 'Haunting', '.About', 'less', 'midway', 'film', 'Murphy', 'collection', 'home', 'videos', 'previous', 'owners', 'course', 'find', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'tape', 'documentation', 'disgruntled', 'married', 'couple', 'played', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Marc', 'Blucas', 'Quickly', 'are', 'frightening', 'similarities', 'Thora', 'Brittany', 'later', 'Thora', 'murdered', 'ghost', 'still', 'estate.At', 'first', 'movie', 'Asian', 'horror', 'film', 'creepy', 'almost', 'poetic', 'style', 'however', 'only', 'one', 'problem', 'scene', 'where', 'Beethoven', 'Moonlight', 'Sonata', 'playing', 'Murphy', 'music', 'sees', 'dead', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'playing', 'piano', 'instead', 'Birch', 'slowly', 'turning', 'face', 'Murphy', 'scene', 'loud', 'obnoxious', 'poor', 'cgi', 'effects', 'result', 'was', 'cheap', 'scare', 'lacked', 'jump', 'one', 'specific', 'scene', 'have', 'listed', 'two', 'facts', 'annoyed', '1', 'director', 'went', 'poor', 'scare', 'tactic', 'ghost', 'slowly', 'turning', 'facing', 'Murphy', '2', 'PLEASE', 'FORGET', 'CGI', 'WHEN', 'SOMETHING', 'IS', 'SIMPLE', '*as', 'Thora', 'deathly', 'makeup*', 'BE', 'CREATIVE', 'AND', 'USE', 'OLD', 'SCHOOL', 'EFECTS', 'Dick', 'Smith', 'could', 'shock', 'millions', 'makeup', 'latex', 'what', 'stopping', 'Hollywood', 'now', 'Instead', 'giving', 'up', 'movie', 'watched', 'end', 'twist', 'was', 'redeeming', 'snagged', '5', 'bend', 'Walmart', 'feel', 'was', 'worth', 'amount', 'money', 'movie', 'rated', 'R', 'believe', 'bogus', 'rating', 'clearly', 'worse', 'PG-13', 'rated', 'film', 'movie', 'gore', 'major', 'minor', 'scare', 'factors', 'interesting', 'watch', 'scale', '1', '10', 'rate', '6', '1/2', 'only', 'thing', 'prevented', 'movie', 'reaching', 'higher', 'number', 'Moonlight', 'Sonata', 'scene', 'frustrated']",N/A

No one pulls off the messed up street urchin better, as she was in most of her roles. This movie just plain sucks. It's slow and uses every horror trick around to try and set a mood and scare but fails. The scenes with the couple and the camera are SO CHEESY and just kill the film. Poor Brittany Murphy does a really bad acting job in this and it's like she realizes; I'm in a bad movie and sleep walks through her scenes. this is evident on the brief behind the scenes where the main star, hardly talks about the movie. The story is stupid and the twist is confusing and terrible. The direction is really bad.People that don't have experience making horror films should not make them. My wife and I both hated this confusing, stupid and cheesy movie. Whoever wrote that it's a fast paced film and the first 20 minutes were amazing, is either an idiot or worked on the film or both. From their review I would say both.The really sad thing is how the death scene in the film in the bathtub and the cover for the DVD mimic what happened to Brittany Murphy. The drugs by the bed and the babbling confusion also add to the weird real life of Brittany Murphy. She also looks horrible in this film. Yes, I know she plays trashy women and always looks a little rough but in this film she looks sick and the lip injections just add to how bad her appearance is. Granted, the lighting was horrible and makes her skin look green a lot but beyond that, she doesn't look healthy at all.If you want to see Brittany in one of her last films, looking bad and giving a half-hearted performance in a really cheesy, boring and bad horror film then go right ahead.

1277992,ABBYHOP59TRZF,B002M9FSD6,Sara,"[35, 35]","For one thing, this must have been one of Brittany Murphy's last movies (and in knowing that, she appears to be very ill.) There is a memorable scene where she looks through a glass door and pauses for a moment in closing it, and there is just this very final, haunting look on her face. If you like spooky, morbid, suspenseful thrillers that are more about making you jump than grossing you out with blood and gore, you will love this movie! An author, Alice goes to stay at an old house for one week to write. Her friend, Rebecca drives Alice to the house and takes the car back with her. Later, Rebecca lets Alice know that her violent ex-boyfriend, Ben is out of jail and may be looking for her. Alice begins hearing noises in the house and comes across some videotapes in the attic of a disturbed couple (Lucy and David.) She becomes absorbed in their story. When she finds the last tape and Rebecca tells her that Lucy and David were never found and are considered missing, Alice suddenly realizes that one of them could be in the house. The ending is a bunch of twists and turns that are open to interpretation. Is this all in Alice's mind or did someone (other than Ben) try to kill her? Lucy's story and Alice's parallel each other so closely. Did Alice just create the very real characters of David and Lucy for her next novel? Rebecca and the audience are left wondering. This type of movie reminded me a lot of What Lies Beneath. But the ending is more in the style of Alfred Hitchcock. The background music is exceptional and really pulls you into the story.",5,You Can't Look Away,1272153600,"04 25, 2010",2010,1571,"['one', 'thing', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'last', 'movies', 'knowing', 'be', 'very', 'ill.', 'memorable', 'scene', 'where', 'glass', 'door', 'pauses', 'moment', 'closing', 'just', 'very', 'final', 'haunting', 'look', 'face', 'like', 'spooky', 'morbid', 'suspenseful', 'thrillers', 'are', 'more', 'making', 'jump', 'grossing', 'blood', 'gore', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'author', 'Alice', 'stay', 'old', 'house', 'one', 'week', 'write', 'friend', 'Rebecca', 'Alice', 'house', 'car', 'back', 'Later', 'Rebecca', 'Alice', 'know', 'violent', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Ben', 'jail', 'may', 'be', 'looking', 'Alice', 'hearing', 'noises', 'house', 'videotapes', 'attic', 'disturbed', 'couple', 'Lucy', 'David', 'absorbed', 'story', 'When', 'last', 'tape', 'Rebecca', 'Lucy', 'David', 'were', 'never', 'found', 'are', 'considered', 'missing', 'Alice', 'suddenly', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'house', 'ending', 'bunch', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'open', 'interpretation', 'Alice', 'mind', 'did', 'someone', 'other', 'Ben', 'try', 'kill', 'Lucy', 'story', 'Alice', 'parallel', 'other', 'so', 'closely', 'Did', 'Alice', 'just', 'create', 'very', 'real', 'characters', 'David', 'Lucy', 'next', 'novel', 'Rebecca', 'audience', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'type', 'movie', 'reminded', 'lot', 'What', 'Lies', 'Beneath', 'ending', 'more', 'style', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'background', 'music', 'exceptional', 'really', 'pulls', 'story']",N/A

Alice (Brittany Murphy) is a writer and has a ""deadline."" Her ex-bf is getting out of prison and she is afraid of him. Her slime ball producer allows her the use of a seclude house so she can be alone and write. Her girlfriend Becky (Tammy Blanchard) takes her out to the big house and strands her there for a week, at Alice's request.This is a good old fashion haunted house with creaky doors (no 3 in 1 Oil) that move themselves, dripping faucets, faint screams, and things that go bump in the night. The camera angles are excellent and give one that voyeuristic, being watched look, couple with the noises they create a haunted atmosphere. The gorgeous Brittany looks defeated and distraught.Through some unusual circumstances Brittany finds and views video left by the former occupants of the home, David (Marc Blucas) and Lucy (Thora Birch) a couple on the verge of breaking up. Lucy is pregnant. David has a video camera and is obsessive with it to the point where it bothers Lucy. Alice, who is on medication for some unknown reason, is also a bit obsessive with her camera.

1277997,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002M9FSD6,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","Brittany Murphy is Alice, a screenwriter moving to an old, abandoned house in order to finish her work. Though her concerned friend Rebecca (Tammy Blanchard) doesn't seem to like the idea, Alice intends to live in this lonely place alone for a week. Then a string of creepy incidents happens to her. Moreover, Alice discovers a video camera and lots of tapes in the house, recording the life of a loving couple Lucy (Thora Birch) and David (Marc Blucas).Umm, this sounds a bit familiar, doesn't it? ""Deadline"" is not very scary with clich&eacute;d scare tactics (like shadows moving across the screen) and a pretty predictable storyline. One unique narrative device is the videotapes that connect the two threads of stories, one about Brittany Murphy's Alice and the other about Thora Birch's Lucy. The supernatural setting and the subsequent interaction between the past and the present might have worked with more interesting characters we can relate to, and more smooth and convincing character development.The production design of the creepy house is decent, and so are the performances from the leading ladies Murphy and Birch, but the concept of ""documenting"" someone's own behaviors is stretched too far, and it begins to look ridiculous in the second half of the film.I like Brittany Murphy, who tragically passed away last year, and Thora Birch, who was so good in ""Ghost World.""
