1144531,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B0013XZ6U2,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[0, 0]","This show is an update of the sort of family-friendly sitcoms which dominated networks in the 1980s.  As such, some of its humor seems cornball and out-of-date to a modern hipster audience, and sometimes it feels a bit lightweight.  But compared to the thirty-minute insult regimens that dominate today's airwaves, it's also a fresh breeze on a hot day.  Just don't come into it expecting innovation or high television art.Bill Engvall plays Bill Pearson, a family counselor has an easier time dispensing advice than following it.  He has the perfect sitcom family: good-looking but sharp-tongued wife (Nancy Travis), precocious teenage daughter (Jennifer Lawrence), daft but crafty teen son (Graham Patrick Martin), and a very young son (Skyler Gisondo) who's smarter than everyone in the room together.  In venerable sitcom style, the humor often involves them talking past each other.Often, the show resembles a live dramatization of an Engvall stage routine.  This comes across most clearly when the family circles the dining table, essentially taking turns feeding Engvall straight lines.  If you like Engvall's stage persona, and want to see more of this family he jokes about, you'll like this show; if you don't, you won't.  It's that simple.  Despite its dated style, I like this humble, unprepossessing show.",4,Humble Family Comedy,1309651200,"07 3, 2011",2011,1318,"['show', 'update', 'sort', 'family-friendly', 'sitcoms', 'dominated', 'networks', '1980s', 'such', 'humor', 'cornball', 'out-of-date', 'modern', 'hipster', 'audience', 'bit', 'lightweight', 'compared', 'thirty-minute', 'insult', 'dominate', 'today', 'airwaves', 'also', 'fresh', 'breeze', 'hot', 'day', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'expecting', 'innovation', 'high', 'television', 'Engvall', 'Bill', 'Pearson', 'family', 'counselor', 'easier', 'time', 'dispensing', 'advice', 'following', 'perfect', 'sitcom', 'family', 'good-looking', 'sharp-tongued', 'wife', 'Nancy', 'Travis', 'precocious', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Jennifer', 'Lawrence', 'daft', 'crafty', 'teen', 'son', 'Graham', 'Patrick', 'Martin', 'very', 'young', 'son', 'Skyler', 'Gisondo', 'who', 'smarter', 'everyone', 'room', 'together', 'venerable', 'sitcom', 'style', 'humor', 'often', 'talking', 'other.Often', 'show', 'live', 'dramatization', 'Engvall', 'stage', 'routine', 'most', 'clearly', 'when', 'family', 'dining', 'table', 'essentially', 'taking', 'turns', 'feeding', 'Engvall', 'straight', 'lines', 'like', 'stage', 'persona', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'family', 'about', ""'ll"", 'like', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'simple', 'dated', 'style', 'like', 'humble', 'unprepossessing', 'show']",The Bill Engvall Show: Season 1

So we were pleased to see he had his own series available on DVD and weren't disappointed. It's great fun, with really likeable characters - this is well observed comedy and anyone with teenage kids will recognise many of the situations. It started slowly in the early episodes, but got better and better and it's just a shame that there were only 8 episodes in series 1. It left us really wanting more!I read that the show has just started a second series on TV in the US, so hopefully there will be more episodes to enjoy this year and roll on the release of series 2 on DVD so that we can enjoy it here in the UK too!Well done Bill.",5,"Great series, can't wait until season 2 comes to DVD",1213228800,"06 12, 2008",2008,738,"['really', 'enjoy', 'Bill', 'Envall', 'comedy', 'living', 'UK', 'get', 'see', 'precious', 'little', 'work', 'were', 'pleased', 'see', 'had', 'own', 'series', 'available', 'DVD', 'were', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'great', 'fun', 'really', 'likeable', 'characters', 'well', 'observed', 'comedy', 'anyone', 'teenage', 'kids', 'will', 'recognise', 'many', 'situations', 'started', 'slowly', 'early', 'episodes', 'got', 'better', 'better', 'just', 'shame', 'were', 'only', '8', 'episodes', 'series', '1', 'left', 'really', 'wanting', 'more', 'read', 'show', 'just', 'started', 'second', 'series', 'TV', 'US', 'so', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'episodes', 'enjoy', 'year', 'roll', 'release', 'series', '2', 'DVD', 'can', 'enjoy', 'here', 'UK', 'too', 'Well', 'done', 'Bill']",The Bill Engvall Show: Season 1
1144533,AYX5LMM3XPRZB,B0013XZ6U2,Mizz Barge,"[2, 2]","It's too bad Bill Engvall's show has been canceled!  This was one of the rare sitcoms our family of four could watch together and everybody enjoyed it:  parents, 10 year old, and 14 year old kids.  The cast was strong and kept things relatively clean AND it was funny!  It's a sad commentary on our society when everything -- and I mean everything -- these days is an ""unscripted"" show because they're so much cheaper to make.  Now we get served up 5 nights a week of Jay Leno in prime time?  Give me a break!  I agree with another reviewer that this was at least one show I didn't have to cover my kids eyes to watch all the way through.  Shame on the network for giving up on it too soon!  And please release the second season before my kids go to college (which is a not-too-subtle hint that there is a strong market for shows like this and others like it -- e.g., ""Family Matters"" which has yet to see the light of day on DVD and may not for another 20 years).",5,Not Enough of a Good Thing,1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,964,"['too', 'bad', 'Bill', 'Engvall', 'show', 'been', 'canceled', 'was', 'one', 'rare', 'sitcoms', 'family', 'four', 'could', 'watch', 'together', 'everybody', 'enjoyed', 'parents', '10', 'year', 'old', '14', 'year', 'old', 'kids', 'cast', 'was', 'strong', 'kept', 'things', 'relatively', 'clean', 'was', 'funny', 'sad', 'commentary', 'society', 'when', 'everything', 'mean', 'everything', 'days', 'unscripted', 'show', ""'re"", 'so', 'much', 'cheaper', 'make', 'Now', 'get', 'served', 'up', '5', 'nights', 'week', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'prime', 'time', 'Give', 'break', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'was', 'least', 'one', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'cover', 'kids', 'eyes', 'watch', 'way', 'Shame', 'network', 'giving', 'up', 'too', 'soon', 'please', 'release', 'second', 'season', 'kids', 'go', 'college', 'not-too-subtle', 'hint', 'strong', 'market', 'shows', 'others', 'e.g.', 'Family', 'Matters', 'yet', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'DVD', 'may', 'not', '20', 'years']",The Bill Engvall Show: Season 1
