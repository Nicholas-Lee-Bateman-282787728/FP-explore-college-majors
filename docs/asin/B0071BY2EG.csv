I could see how if you didn't like this type of music, you'd hate the movie. 90% of this movie is the music. Its not like your usual musical where people break out into song randomly...there is actually a reason for them to be singing. I personally enjoyed the music, there were some lame tunes, some funny songs, and some catchy ones. The ending was a little weak but the gore was decent. Overall I was entertained. I highly recommend checking out some music clips from this youtube before watching so you can see if this kind of music is your thing. If its not, don't bother watching. 3.5/5 stars from me.Check out my horror movie/book review blog for a more in depth review of this movie.*UPDATE 8/11/12* I have now seen this movie about 5 different times, and honestly, I just love it. I've updated my original 3 stars to 4. The whole reason I love this movie is the music. The overall MOVIE portion is a little weak. I've been told you aren't supposed to really KNOW what happened at the end of the movie. It seems obvious to me other then 1 particular scene, but that could be sloppy editing. I have no idea.If you like musicals, check this out.

Hyder ""Hnyvek""","[1, 8]","I'm not sure exactly what D'Onofrio was going going for here, but I'm guessing it was an excuse to sit hang out in the forest and smoke a little bit. The movie has a decent foundation to build an acceptable horror/slasher flick, but on all accounts they just pissed on it. The acting isn't terrible, the music is actually really freaking good, but it lacks any kind solid story, and you can find more believable violence on daytime public TV.

1524023,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0071BY2EG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[7, 9]","Actor Vincent D'Onofrio takes the directorial reins for the peculiar ""Don't Go In The Woods.""  I had read a lot about this film prior to seeing it, and it was absolutely eviscerated by mainstream critics.  Combining horror with music, the film doesn't really succeed in either genre.  But, for some reason, I find it utterly fascinating--flaws and all.  I had heard so many people proclaim this the worst film of the year so far, I guess my expectations were fairly low.  As such, I was pleasantly surprised to find this oddity better than expected.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a particularly good movie from a traditional standpoint but it is weirdly appealing.Perhaps the first issue that this indie faces is that it positioned itself as a horror film (more specifically a slasher).  It even shares its title with a horrendously awful 1981 splatter-fest.  I'll be generous to the horror elements in this film when I say that they seem like a complete afterthought, just tacked on to make things slightly more interesting.  Anyone who approaches ""Don't Go In The Woods"" expecting thrills and chills will be sorely disappointed.  The killings are not distinguished by any real cleverness, are relatively infrequent until the finale, and are explained away using the most cliche'd device in horror movie history.  I was amused (and not at all surprised) when the final solutions became apparent, but it is all so lazily constructed and logistically head-scratching to make much of an impact.  And still, once the final minutes of the film kicked into overdrive--I went along with it and even got a chuckle from the film's signature closing line.The film, however, is far more of a musical than anything.  If you've ever frequented a coffee house that features indie artists, you have the vibe of the singing and singers in ""Don't Go In The Woods.""  Some songs are better than others, some singers are more accomplished.  It all has a refreshing rawness and realness.  In some of the more dramatic numbers (the ones that seem to tie into the plot), the lyrics are delightfully over-the-top.  And I don't mean this in an intended humorous way!  But this conviction ups the cheese factor, and (however unintentionally) I appreciated this.  In the end, this is a slight film with little plot.  It's not a big successful musical or a scary and clever slasher.  It is an experiment that might have benefited from a more ambitious screenplay or storyline, and I wouldn't have minded a bit more humor.  Still, the film had an appealing underdog quality and, maybe because I had minimal expectations, I enjoyed it more than I had anticipated.

But there's one place that does stick out in my mind where it went very wrong indeed--that moment where D'Onofrio decided to take this rather boring slasher film (whether it is a remake, reboot, reimagining, whatever of the 1981 film of the same name I could not tell) and make it a musical. Yes, a musical. Up to a certain point, it could have easily been a bad horror movie about a rock band who go off into the woods in order to get their heads clear and write some new material. There's music involved, of course there is, but it's not a ""musical"" in the sense that the music is integrated into parts of the script where it would not normally be. Band members playing songs and singing, huzzah, and a bunch of groupies and girlfriends and the like have followed them up from New York and gate-crashed the party, which makes lead singer Nick (Matt Sbeglia) angry, for what should be obvious reasons. He blows up and one of the girls stalks off...and starts singing a riff on one of the songs that was just played while walking through the woods. Oh, god, movie, you did just hit a new low indeed. That would be enough to give it a low rating (it is saved from the lowest because a few of the singers are actually quite good; unfortunately, the guy who plays Nick is not one of them) by itself, but then comes the climax, in which Our Director attempts to come up with some ambiguity, but does so in such an inept, ham-fisted way that the viewer is likely to end up scratching his head wondering what on earth Mr. D'Onofrio thought he was doing.
