1082760,AS558SNWF1DXG,B000RO6JYU,Clare Quilty,"[7, 9]","This is an airless, somewhat smug, fatally mild-mannered satire about the production process behind a doomed television drama. Duchovny plays a writer/producer whose autobiographical show is, bit by bit, compromised by Weaver's executive -- the casting, the tone, the plot and even the title are all eventually distorted by a suit who takes demographic readings from her teenage daughter.This war between artistry and commerce isn't exactly breaking news, and in fact it was already tackled years ago by the smarter, funnier ""The Big Picture.""""The TV Set"" is pitched too loose. Though he has plenty of opportunities, Duchovny's character never really articulates any kind of vision, and the film loses a lot of tension because the story he wants to tell really doesn't look much better than the compromised version. Even when the final version of the show appears, he seems more angry over its implied failure than he does over the loss of his vision.Ioan Gruffudd plays a supposedly ingenious BBC executive lured to America who seems to have Duchovny's back but he, too, never asserts himself in a realistic way -- his character seems like an incomplete thought, as does the go-nowhere failed courtship/feuding between the show's two leads. And Weaver's lines are all on-the-nose jabs at a corporate mentality (""Original kind of scares me,"" she says, surprisingly without the accompaniment of a rim-shot).What's up with Kasdan? He made the wonderful ""Zero Effect"" followed by the sort of cynical teen comedy ""Orange County"" which wasn't nearly as funny as the films that inspired it. But I miss the wit and imagination that I thought ""Zero"" offered a promise of. Those qualities certainly don't arrive in ""The TV Set.""One ammendment to my 2-star review: There's a commentary track on this disc between Kasdan and Judd Apatow that, to my mind, is far more enjoyable than the movie itself. They don't talk a lot about what's going on on-screen, but spend more time discussing the television work they've done that inspired the movie -- ""Freaks and Geeks,"" ""Undeclared,"" ""Larry Sanders,"" ""The Ben Stiller Show.""

The film shows the inner workings of the T.V. industry and how a pilot episode is pitched, then produced, and, in this case, ruined.The TV Set makes the very valid point that the networks care less about creativity and more about stroking egos. Anything that deviates from tried and true formula is questioned. This film seems to say that sex and broad comedy is what people, for the most part, want to see on T.V. - hardly a revelation. Making a T.V. show is often a series of compromises and it's a miracle that anything decent ever makes it on the air. The TV Set shows the physical and emotional toll the process takes on people, adopting a very low-key tone (that is sometimes so low-key, it's non-existent), quietly making its points. It is most definitely not a bad film, just not a very dynamic one either.There is an audio commentary by director Jake Kasdan, actors David Duchovny and Lindsay Sloane, and producer Aaron Ryder. They all joke and banter with Duchovny's dry, deadpanned jokes being a real treat. Everyone recounts filming anecdotes in this fun, loose track.Also included is a commentary with Kasdan and executive producer Judd Apatow. They talk about the nuts and bolts of making a T.V. show and recount some of their experiences working on shows likeFreaks and Geeks - The Complete SeriesandUndeclared - The Complete Series. Clearly their experiences working in T.V. were fodder for the characters and content in the film. This is a funny, insightful track.""The Making of The TV Set"" is an above average electronic press kit. Kasdan started off in T.V. making pilot episodes for shows that never got picked up.Finally, there is one deleted scene that spoofs the popularity of lawyer and medical dramas - the main competition for Mike's new show.",3,A biting satire that lacks teeth...,1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,1910,"['TV', 'Set', 'satire', 'television', 'be', 'nextNetwork', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'much', 'more', 'laid-back', 'approach', 'film', 'inner', 'workings', 'T.V', 'industry', 'how', 'pilot', 'episode', 'pitched', 'then', 'produced', 'case', 'ruined.The', 'TV', 'Set', 'very', 'valid', 'point', 'networks', 'care', 'less', 'creativity', 'more', 'stroking', 'egos', 'Anything', 'tried', 'true', 'formula', 'questioned', 'film', 'say', 'sex', 'broad', 'comedy', 'what', 'people', 'most', 'part', 'want', 'see', 'T.V', 'hardly', 'revelation', 'Making', 'T.V', 'show', 'often', 'series', 'compromises', 'miracle', 'anything', 'decent', 'ever', 'air', 'TV', 'Set', 'physical', 'emotional', 'toll', 'process', 'people', 'adopting', 'very', 'low-key', 'tone', 'sometimes', 'so', 'low-key', 'non-existent', 'quietly', 'making', 'points', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'dynamic', 'one', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Jake', 'Kasdan', 'actors', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Lindsay', 'Sloane', 'producer', 'Aaron', 'Ryder', 'joke', 'banter', 'Duchovny', 'dry', 'deadpanned', 'jokes', 'being', 'real', 'treat', 'Everyone', 'recounts', 'filming', 'anecdotes', 'fun', 'loose', 'track.Also', 'included', 'commentary', 'Kasdan', 'executive', 'producer', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'talk', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'making', 'T.V', 'show', 'recount', 'experiences', 'working', 'shows', 'likeFreaks', 'Geeks', 'Complete', 'SeriesandUndeclared', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Clearly', 'experiences', 'working', 'T.V', 'were', 'fodder', 'characters', 'content', 'film', 'funny', 'insightful', 'track', 'Making', 'TV', 'Set', 'above', 'average', 'electronic', 'press', 'kit', 'Kasdan', 'started', 'off', 'T.V', 'making', 'pilot', 'episodes', 'shows', 'never', 'got', 'picked', 'up.Finally', 'one', 'deleted', 'scene', 'popularity', 'lawyer', 'medical', 'dramas', 'main', 'competition', 'Mike', 'new', 'show']",The TV Set
1082762,AHPV4F8IVSC39,B000RO6JYU,"Douglas B. Moran ""Computer+History/Politics""","[2, 5]","As other reviews have pointed out, not only is there nothing here that hasn't appeared in hundreds of similar takes on making movies/TV, there is nothing fresh nor involving.If you think about what is happening--rather than simply accept the characters' pronouncements--the writer Mike Klein (Duchovny) comes off much worse than intended, and the executives much better.  A movie is a real mess when what appears on the screen contradicts its intended message.-- Examples/details --Contrary to the pronouncements that the show is high quality, the 2.5 scenes we see indicate it is bad.  One scene is wacky, one is overly sentimental, and the half is mundane exposition.  Furthermore, it is characterized as a (derivative) mix of ""Northern Exposure"", ""Ed"" and ""Seinfeld"".  This made it impossible for me to identify with writer Klein.The movie's script presents the executives as interfering with the ""creative vision"" by asking the legitimate question of why a suicide, rather than an ordinary death, needs to a key part of the show and of the motivation for the show's lead.  Klein is repeatedly unable to give even the slightest explanation.  Klein comes off as arbitrary, stubborn, and indulging himself (Klein's brother was a suicide), whereas the executives come off as worrying about the show itself.The script intends to present the selection of the actors as interference by the executives, but what you see is them picking ones who gave the far better auditions.  Klein wants a friend for the male lead, but the scene used in the audition (wacky material) is inappropriate for the friend's (flat) style, and even then he appears amateurish.  I was left wondering if the friend was anything more than a crony.  And with what follows, it is implausible that Zack, the actor chosen, could have been a legitimate finalist. Instead, Klein appears to have been trying to manipulate the executives into choosing his friend, but wound up sabotaging his own show.The audition for the female lead produced the one memorable line ""I think that Jessie has fake breasts, and I believe that over the life of the series the audience can feel that."" It comes across as just a crass way for the executive (Weaver) to say ""We're going with talent, rather than looks.""  If Jessie had given the better audition, this line could have had very different meaning.  So what is wrong with the executives picking the actress who, although not statuesque, was still a beauty and was able to project a winsome personality?On focus groups, the script undercuts itself by its wildly implausible participants: They are miles away from being members of the demographics that the real-life networks rabidly pursue. Consequently, the movie has no credibility at the end when it presents the wildly transformed TV show.The exec played by Ioan Gruffudd is a role so small in both screen time and impact on the story, I had to wonder why it was there at all.  If I had come cold to the movie, I would have suspected that his role had been intended to be the lead (the outsider/new arrival is a standard dramatic device) with writer Klein as one of the ""villains"", but that when Duchovny signed on as Klein, the script was hastily rewritten to make him the lead.  A movie is a real mess when one incorrectly suspects such butchery.Note that I am NOT saying that real-life executives haven't butchered good shows. Rather, in this movie, the screenwriter Kasdan, through the character Klein, falsely equates whatever the ""artist"" _wants_ to do with being _good_ art.",2,"Bland, with script that contradicts its thesis",1245628800,"06 22, 2009",2009,3535,"['other', 'reviews', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'there', 'nothing', 'here', ""n't"", 'appeared', 'hundreds', 'similar', 'making', 'movies/TV', 'nothing', 'fresh', 'involving.If', 'think', 'what', 'happening', 'rather', 'simply', 'accept', 'characters', 'pronouncements', 'writer', 'Mike', 'Klein', 'Duchovny', 'off', 'much', 'worse', 'intended', 'executives', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'real', 'mess', 'when', 'what', 'screen', 'intended', 'message.', 'Examples/details', 'Contrary', 'pronouncements', 'show', 'high', 'quality', '2.5', 'scenes', 'see', 'indicate', 'bad', 'One', 'scene', 'wacky', 'one', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'half', 'mundane', 'exposition', 'Furthermore', 'characterized', 'derivative', 'mix', 'Northern', 'Exposure', 'Ed', 'Seinfeld', 'made', 'impossible', 'identify', 'writer', 'Klein.The', 'movie', 'script', 'executives', 'interfering', 'creative', 'vision', 'asking', 'legitimate', 'question', 'why', 'suicide', 'rather', 'ordinary', 'death', 'key', 'part', 'show', 'motivation', 'show', 'lead', 'Klein', 'repeatedly', 'unable', 'give', 'even', 'slightest', 'explanation', 'Klein', 'off', 'arbitrary', 'stubborn', 'indulging', 'Klein', 'brother', 'was', 'suicide', 'executives', 'come', 'off', 'worrying', 'show', 'itself.The', 'script', 'present', 'selection', 'actors', 'interference', 'executives', 'what', 'see', 'picking', 'ones', 'who', 'gave', 'far', 'better', 'auditions', 'Klein', 'friend', 'male', 'lead', 'scene', 'used', 'audition', 'wacky', 'material', 'inappropriate', 'friend', 'flat', 'style', 'even', 'then', 'amateurish', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'friend', 'was', 'anything', 'more', 'crony', 'what', 'implausible', 'Zack', 'actor', 'chosen', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'legitimate', 'finalist', 'Instead', 'Klein', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'manipulate', 'executives', 'choosing', 'friend', 'wound', 'up', 'sabotaging', 'own', 'show.The', 'audition', 'female', 'lead', 'produced', 'one', 'memorable', 'line', 'think', 'Jessie', 'fake', 'breasts', 'believe', 'life', 'series', 'audience', 'can', 'feel', 'as', 'just', 'crass', 'way', 'executive', 'Weaver', 'say', ""'re"", 'going', 'talent', 'rather', 'looks', 'Jessie', 'had', 'given', 'better', 'audition', 'line', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'different', 'meaning', 'what', 'wrong', 'executives', 'picking', 'actress', 'who', 'not', 'statuesque', 'was', 'still', 'beauty', 'was', 'able', 'project', 'winsome', 'personality', 'focus', 'groups', 'script', 'wildly', 'implausible', 'participants', 'are', 'miles', 'away', 'being', 'members', 'demographics', 'real-life', 'networks', 'rabidly', 'pursue', 'Consequently', 'movie', 'credibility', 'end', 'when', 'wildly', 'transformed', 'TV', 'show.The', 'exec', 'played', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'role', 'so', 'small', 'screen', 'time', 'impact', 'story', 'had', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'there', 'had', 'come', 'cold', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'suspected', 'role', 'had', 'been', 'intended', 'be', 'lead', 'outsider/new', 'arrival', 'standard', 'dramatic', 'device', 'writer', 'Klein', 'one', 'villains', 'when', 'Duchovny', 'signed', 'Klein', 'script', 'was', 'hastily', 'rewritten', 'make', 'lead', 'movie', 'real', 'mess', 'when', 'one', 'incorrectly', 'such', 'am', 'NOT', 'saying', 'real-life', 'executives', 'have', ""n't"", 'butchered', 'good', 'shows', 'Rather', 'movie', 'screenwriter', 'Kasdan', 'character', 'Klein', 'falsely', 'artist', '_wants_', 'do', 'being', '_good_', 'art']",The TV Set

With her natural authority and scathing wit, she goes back to laceratingWorking Girlmode and makes Lenny the complete embodiment of the decline of commercial television with her mantra, ""Originality scares me."" Acerbically written and directed by Jake Kasdan, Lawrence's older son and a TV insider himself, the film focuses specifically on the development of one sitcom pilot from its casting to the show's presentation to the network affiliates. Its creator is Mike Klein, a seasoned TV writer whose brother's suicide inspired him toward his autobiographical concept.The story's scope is brief compared to what Sidney Lumet and Paddy Chavefsky already covered with visceral aplomb thirty years ago with the brilliantNetwork, but Kasdan treads familiar subject matter here. The interactions between Mike and the network suits, in particular, Lenny, are funny, but they begin to get repetitive as the plot meanders toward a rather abrupt conclusion. The other shortcoming is the erratic shift in the movie's perspective between Mike and Richard McCallister, a BBC-imported programming whiz who sympathizes with Mike but finds himself inextricably tangled with network politics. Both Duchovny and Gruffudd are fine in their rather curtailed roles, and there is a smart supporting cast that helps to propel the slim plot - Judy Greer as Mike's perpetually waffling manager, Justine Bateman as his grounded wife, Fran Kranz changing from doofus to egomaniac as the sitcom lead, Lindsay Sloane as the increasingly savvy ing&eacute;nue, and Andrea Martin in a funny bit as a cynical costumer.The film's wry tone reminds me of Christopher Guest'sFor Your Consideration, though Guest cuts a broader and deeper swath on the entertainment industry. Kasdan presents a more insular world in this movie, and the result feels less than resonant to the casual viewer. The 2007 DVD boasts two commentary tracks, which seems excessive for something so small-scale - the first is with Kasdan, Duchovny, Sloane and producer Aaron Ryder about the details of the production and the second again with Kasdan but with executive producer Judd Apatow (The 40-Year-Old Virgin,Knocked Up) to discuss more of what inspired the film itself.

1082764,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,B000RO6JYU,Genevieve Hayes,"[1, 3]","Mike Klein's (David Duchovny) television pilot has been given the green light for production. However, the ""few small changes"" he has to make in order to keep the network executives happy, turn out to be bigger than he first anticipated. This film follows the making of Klein's pilot.There is nothing worse than a movie written by someone with an axe to grind and that is just how ""The TV Set"" comes across. ""The TV Set"" is a relatively low-budget independent movie written by someone (Jake Kasdan) who obviously bears a grudge against the Hollywood establishment and against the television networks in general. The argument Kasdan puts forward in this film is that Hollywood is populated by people so dumb that they wouldn't know quality entertainment if it bit them on the rear and who feel the need to bring everything down to their level. This may be true, but if you're going to put forward an argument like this, then you have to back it with a quality film, which Kasdan doesn't. Throughout this film, I felt that Kasdan was trying to hit back at Hollywood for not recognizing his own work as being high quality, but it never once occurs to him that perhaps Hollywood doesn't see him as great because he isn't.""The TV Set"" is a poorly written and unfunny ""comedy"" that is based on the faulty premise that a Hollywood network actually cares what a single previously unheard of writer thinks. There are a lot of ideas in this film that could have worked very well, given the right writer, but Kasdan isn't that writer. None of the ideas are taken far enough. The basic premise of this film is that the trashier Klein's pilot becomes, the more popular it gets, but the pilot doesn't actually become all that trashy, by current TV standards, it just becomes bad. Similarly, one sub-plot involving Ioan Gruffudd has Gruffudd's character starting to wonder whether it would be better to give the people good TV rather than trash, but that plot line never seems to go anywhere. The only really good thing about this film is Seth Green's cameo, right at the end of the film (in the credits), but two minutes of Seth Green is not enough to justify sitting through the 85 minutes that precede it.",2,Axe grinding makes for bad viewing,1231545600,"01 10, 2009",2009,2193,"['Mike', 'Klein', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'television', 'pilot', 'been', 'given', 'green', 'light', 'production', 'However', 'few', 'small', 'changes', 'make', 'order', 'keep', 'network', 'executives', 'happy', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'bigger', 'first', 'anticipated', 'film', 'making', 'Klein', 'pilot.There', 'nothing', 'worse', 'movie', 'written', 'someone', 'axe', 'grind', 'just', 'how', 'TV', 'Set', 'across', 'TV', 'Set', 'relatively', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'movie', 'written', 'someone', 'Jake', 'Kasdan', 'who', 'obviously', 'grudge', 'Hollywood', 'establishment', 'television', 'networks', 'general', 'argument', 'Kasdan', 'forward', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'populated', 'people', 'so', 'dumb', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'rear', 'who', 'feel', 'need', 'bring', 'everything', 'down', 'level', 'may', 'be', 'true', ""'re"", 'going', 'put', 'forward', 'argument', 'then', 'have', 'back', 'quality', 'film', 'Kasdan', ""n't"", 'Throughout', 'film', 'felt', 'Kasdan', 'was', 'trying', 'hit', 'back', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'recognizing', 'own', 'work', 'being', 'high', 'quality', 'never', 'once', 'perhaps', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'see', 'as', 'great', ""n't"", 'TV', 'Set', 'poorly', 'written', 'unfunny', 'comedy', 'based', 'faulty', 'premise', 'Hollywood', 'network', 'actually', 'what', 'single', 'previously', 'writer', 'thinks', 'are', 'lot', 'ideas', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'given', 'right', 'writer', 'Kasdan', ""n't"", 'writer', 'None', 'ideas', 'are', 'taken', 'far', 'enough', 'basic', 'premise', 'film', 'trashier', 'Klein', 'pilot', 'becomes', 'more', 'popular', 'pilot', ""n't"", 'actually', 'become', 'trashy', 'current', 'TV', 'standards', 'just', 'bad', 'Similarly', 'one', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Gruffudd', 'character', 'starting', 'wonder', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'give', 'people', 'good', 'TV', 'rather', 'trash', 'plot', 'line', 'never', 'go', 'anywhere', 'only', 'really', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'Seth', 'Green', 'cameo', 'right', 'end', 'film', 'credits', 'two', 'minutes', 'Seth', 'Green', 'not', 'enough', 'justify', 'sitting', '85', 'minutes', 'precede']",The TV Set

1082768,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000RO6JYU,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","***1/2Diehard fans of network television are sure to get a kick out of ""The TV Set,"" a rib-tickling parody about the making (and possible unmaking) of a TV pilot.  Mike Klein (David Duchovny) is the writer who has high hopes for his new dark comedy series entitled ""The Wexley Chronicles"" - until, that is, he sees the purity of his artistic vision becoming increasingly compromised the longer the filming goes on.  Klein views his creation as a cutting-edge mixture of comedy and tragedy, but the powers-that-be seem to have their own concept of where it ought to be heading (i.e., the tragedy is too depressing and the comedy needs to be kicked up a notch or two if the show is to have any chance of achieving broad popular appeal).  The foremost liability is that, against his better judgment and strenuous protestations, Klein has been saddled with an actor, Zach Harper, who's a scenery-chewing ham if ever there was one (whom, naturally, the show`s ham-fisted producers feel is just perfect for the role).  In short, Klein finds his work being undermined and sabotaged every step of the way by bottom-line corporate executives, intrusive producers, sycophantic underlings, temperamental performers, fence-sitting decision-makers, knob-turning test-audiences, and even a pregnant wife who, though supportive of Klein's vision, keeps insisting he hang in there for the sake of the baby on the way.""The TV Set"" succeeds primarily because it has been conceived more as a gentle spoof than as a full-throttled, rip-everything-to-shreds farce.  As such, it resists the temptation to go more broad and over-the-top than it needs to in its comedy, thereby allowing us to relate more fully with the characters.  Basing the film in part on some of his own personal experiences in the business, writer/director Jake Kasdan has written a sly script filled with subtle humor, laugh-out-loud moments and cunning insight into all the behind-the-scenes compromising that goes into the making of a TV show.The film is further buoyed by its sharp and delightful cast, consisting of Duchovny (his face all but buried under a bushy beard),  Ioan Gruffudd, Judy Greer, Fran Kranz, Lindsay Sloane, Justine Bateman and Philip Baker Hall.  Sigourney Weaver deserves special recognition for her juicy turn as the producer whose ratings-driven ruthlessness is barely hidden beneath a thin veneer of faux caring and sweetness (think of this as a somewhat toned-down version of Faye Dunaway`s character in ""Network"").""The TV Set"" makes it clear that's it's hard for any artist to keep true to his principles in a cutthroat industry where business generally comes ahead of art, and where the lowest-common denominator often serves as the sole criterion for deciding which series will be green-lighted and which will be stopped dead in their tracks.  But it does so in such a lighthearted, tweaking sort of way that it prevents any potential bitterness or rancor from slipping into the tone.",3,Knowing spoof of the TV Biz,1215734400,"07 11, 2008",2008,2967,"['***1/2Diehard', 'fans', 'network', 'television', 'are', 'sure', 'get', 'kick', 'TV', 'Set', 'rib-tickling', 'parody', 'making', 'possible', 'unmaking', 'TV', 'pilot', 'Mike', 'Klein', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'writer', 'who', 'high', 'hopes', 'new', 'dark', 'comedy', 'series', 'entitled', 'Wexley', 'Chronicles', 'purity', 'artistic', 'vision', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'compromised', 'longer', 'filming', 'Klein', 'creation', 'cutting-edge', 'mixture', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'powers-that-be', 'seem', 'have', 'own', 'concept', 'where', 'ought', 'be', 'heading', 'i.e.', 'tragedy', 'too', 'depressing', 'comedy', 'be', 'kicked', 'up', 'notch', 'two', 'show', 'have', 'chance', 'achieving', 'broad', 'popular', 'appeal', 'foremost', 'liability', 'better', 'judgment', 'strenuous', 'protestations', 'Klein', 'been', 'saddled', 'actor', 'Zach', 'Harper', 'who', 'scenery-chewing', 'ham', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'whom', 'naturally', 'show', 's', 'ham-fisted', 'producers', 'feel', 'just', 'perfect', 'role', 'short', 'Klein', 'work', 'being', 'undermined', 'sabotaged', 'step', 'way', 'bottom-line', 'corporate', 'executives', 'intrusive', 'producers', 'sycophantic', 'underlings', 'temperamental', 'performers', 'fence-sitting', 'decision-makers', 'knob-turning', 'test-audiences', 'even', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'who', 'supportive', 'Klein', 'vision', 'insisting', 'sake', 'baby', 'way', 'TV', 'Set', 'primarily', 'been', 'conceived', 'more', 'gentle', 'spoof', 'full-throttled', 'rip-everything-to-shreds', 'farce', 'such', 'temptation', 'go', 'more', 'broad', 'over-the-top', 'comedy', 'thereby', 'allowing', 'relate', 'more', 'fully', 'characters', 'Basing', 'film', 'part', 'own', 'personal', 'experiences', 'business', 'writer/director', 'Jake', 'Kasdan', 'written', 'sly', 'script', 'filled', 'subtle', 'humor', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'cunning', 'insight', 'behind-the-scenes', 'compromising', 'making', 'TV', 'show.The', 'film', 'further', 'buoyed', 'sharp', 'delightful', 'cast', 'consisting', 'Duchovny', 'face', 'buried', 'bushy', 'beard', 'Ioan', 'Gruffudd', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'Fran', 'Kranz', 'Lindsay', 'Sloane', 'Justine', 'Bateman', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'special', 'recognition', 'juicy', 'turn', 'producer', 'ratings-driven', 'ruthlessness', 'barely', 'hidden', 'beneath', 'thin', 'veneer', 'faux', 'caring', 'sweetness', 'think', 'somewhat', 'toned-down', 'version', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 's', 'character', 'Network', 'TV', 'Set', 'clear', 'hard', 'artist', 'keep', 'true', 'principles', 'cutthroat', 'industry', 'where', 'business', 'generally', 'ahead', 'art', 'where', 'lowest-common', 'denominator', 'often', 'sole', 'criterion', 'deciding', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'green-lighted', 'will', 'be', 'stopped', 'dead', 'tracks', 'so', 'such', 'lighthearted', 'tweaking', 'sort', 'way', 'potential', 'bitterness', 'rancor', 'slipping', 'tone']",The TV Set

Marking filmmaker Jake Kasdan's first outing as both writer and director since 1998's excellent ""Zero Point,"" the film is now available on DVD after a limited theatrical run last spring. Judd Apatow, who has produced many box office smashes as of late (""Superbad,"" ""The-40-Year-Old Virgin)"" serves as executive producer.Mike (David Duchovny) is an aspiring TV writer who has paid his dues and finally has his pilot, ""The Wexler Chronicles,"" up for serious consideration. However, there are roadblocks along the way, and most of them stem from Lenny (Sigourney Weaver), a network president who relentlessly streamlines his heartfelt, character-driven program to maximize its mainstream appeal (read: dumb it down) because, as she puts it, ""original scares me a little.""On the sidelines are many people with their own specific agendas. Richard McAllister (Ioan Gruffudd), Lenny's top underling flown in from Britain due to his involvement in smash UK series, does his best to find compromise between his obsessive boss and Mike's deep-seated creativity, even if it means that he has no time whatsoever for his family. Further muddying the waters, Mike's assistant Alice (Judy Greer) is always finds a way to put a positive twist on every awful piece of news she delivers him, one of which is Lenny's mandate that Zach Harper (Fran Kranz) play the eponymous protagonist in favor of an immeasurably better actor simply because the boardroom brass all agree that their teenage daughters ""will love him.""Elsewhere, Harper harasses his co-star Laurel Simon (Lindsay Sloane) while Mike's wife Natalie (Justine Bateman) pressures him to accept Lenny's provisions - after all, they have a baby on the way! Add in an overzealous production crew and a child extra who absolutely must have his scenes filmed by the end of the afternoon and the kettle is set to boil over.Duchovny does a fine job of embodying the vast sensitivity that is par for the course in dedicated, feeling writers, making the tension in his scenes with Weaver go beyond piercing. Behind each others' backs he loathes her bloodsucking ways and she dismisses him as corny and ""too blue state,"" but when they're together McAllister and Judy always show up to keep things going like clockwork.""This is very personal to me because my brother killed himself,"" Mike says in defense of his initial idea for the show. ""That's where all this came from, and the suicide, to me, has always been kind of the premise for everything that happens.""""I know,"" says Lenny, ""but let's just think about it for a second. What if it weren't?""Christopher Guest's ""For Your Consideration"" from late last year, which similarly satirized the film industry, delivered raucous belly laughs hand over fist, while ""The TV Set"" is much more tongue-in-cheek. However, Weaver's absolutely perfect performance is reason alone to rent it. A no-holds-barred businesswoman with a one-track mind, Lenny has all the best lines:""I think that Jessie has fake breasts,"" she says after an audition, ""and I believe that over the life of the series the audience can feel that.""Kasdan does a first-rate job all-around because even throughout a fast-paced 88 minutes he manages to craft depth and dimension in even the smallest of characters, including McAllister's wife Chloe (Lucy Davis), whose full-on sadness bounces off the screen in her few precious scenes, providing context throughout the film. The result is a satisfying movie with storylines that intertwine flawlessly.""The TV Set"" is indeed a fine, original film, so it wouldn't make it on Lenny's lineup - not with shows like ""Slut Wars"" ever in demand.
