No doubt it will hit the right notes for some people while making no sense at all to others.  Park does take a swipe at giant SUVs so if you regard them as something positive you may take offense.  But come on, it just wouldn't have been as funny with a station wagon.",4,Much better than you'd expect,1275782400,"06 6, 2010",2010,397,"['Park', 'bit', 'exaggerated', 'stereotyped', 'characters', 'still', 'be', 'quite', 'funny', 'rather', 'sweet', 'doubt', 'will', 'hit', 'right', 'notes', 'people', 'making', 'sense', 'others', 'Park', 'take', 'swipe', 'giant', 'SUVs', 'so', 'regard', 'something', 'positive', 'may', 'take', 'offense', 'come', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'station', 'wagon']",Park

Bad acting and weak attempts at humor finally made me skim through it - something I very seldom do. I finally just erased it and went to bed. I envy the people who find this hilarious - they must enjoy life a lot more than I do. (Just kidding, of course.) For a more sophisticated review of this so-called hilarious movie, check the Rotten Tomatoes review. The film gets  half of a star from that reviewer.",1,"Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this kind of ""comedy""",1242086400,"05 12, 2009",2009,485,"['watched', '30', 'minutes', 'recorded', 'TV', 'then', 'boredom', 'set', 'Bad', 'acting', 'weak', 'attempts', 'humor', 'finally', 'made', 'something', 'very', 'seldom', 'do', 'finally', 'just', 'erased', 'went', 'bed', 'envy', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'hilarious', 'must', 'enjoy', 'life', 'lot', 'more', 'do', 'Just', 'kidding', 'course', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'review', 'so-called', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'check', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'review', 'film', 'half', 'star', 'reviewer']",Park

I'm afraid that many Viewers will rate the film based upon their own similar experiences, rather than the film's plot-line and specific situations.  We all allow our personal experiences in life to season our reviews, but that doesn't mean that a non-cheating person who has not be attacked in an SUV can't see the hilarity in that situation occuring.  Hahahahahahaha...I doubt that anyone will experience an epifany watching this film, but a good time will be had by all if you loosen your tie (or bra, as the case may be), forget any minor personal problems and let this ""fluffy"" diversion work it's magic on you.  Fun, fun, fun!To my knowledge, there isn't a sequel planned, but think about the situations that could be afforded the story after night fell on the Park.  Oh my.",5,Daytime Action at the Park...

1149711,ANM2SCEUL3WL1,B0015I2S10,Pristine,"[7, 15]","Four stories that eventually intersect.  1) A girl drives to a remote overlook in Los Angeles, ready to take her life.  Will she succeed?  2) Two pet grooming service workers passes by in a service truck: an unattractive man and an eastern European gold-digging hottie user, who wants to land a man equal to her stature in looks and cash in on the rest.  She has arranged to meet with Dennis, a big man with a really big SUV to compensate for something really small under his hood.  3) The man's wife and her friend follow him and spy on him.  They have a plan for payback if she can catch him in the act.  4) Two male and two female co-workers spend lunch in a company van.  The girls suspect the two guys are gay, but they confess to being something else altogether.  What further secrets will be revealed and more importantly, who will be dared into doing something to settle a philosophical debate about our society?The movie tries to pull off a Joe Orton / Four Rooms intersecting situational comedy.  Instead, what we get is a quasi-chick flick that never quite takes off.  I say this because 1) The female roles contain long monologues that reveal what is going on inside their minds, while the male roles are completely flat and stunted in dimension.  2) No matter how good or nasty (in a bad way) a person was, each straight girl ends up with a hot sexy hunky stranger (who incidentally, speaks very little) whisking her off to a happy ending, while the nasty guy gets dealt his full comeuppance.  3) Hot English guy with gratuitous British accent that American girls go ga-ga over.A girl comes to a realization in her life, then dumps her best friend (who helped her discover and arrive at that realization ) leaving her in the middle of nowhere to her own devices, while she drives off to pursue her dreams.  It's difficult to root for characters who are this self-absorbed in their own happiness.Whoever made this movie really has it in for SUV's, as the automobile becomes a target for all the trite cliches behind why anyone would want to drive one.",2,Hard to win the audience over,1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,2063,"['Four', 'stories', 'eventually', 'intersect', '1', 'girl', 'remote', 'overlook', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'ready', 'take', 'life', 'Will', 'succeed', '2', 'Two', 'pet', 'grooming', 'service', 'workers', 'passes', 'service', 'truck', 'unattractive', 'man', 'eastern', 'European', 'gold-digging', 'hottie', 'user', 'who', 'land', 'man', 'equal', 'stature', 'looks', 'cash', 'rest', 'arranged', 'meet', 'Dennis', 'big', 'man', 'really', 'big', 'SUV', 'compensate', 'something', 'really', 'small', 'hood', '3', 'man', 'wife', 'friend', 'follow', 'spy', 'have', 'plan', 'payback', 'can', 'catch', 'act', '4', 'Two', 'male', 'two', 'female', 'co-workers', 'spend', 'lunch', 'company', 'van', 'girls', 'suspect', 'two', 'guys', 'are', 'gay', 'confess', 'being', 'something', 'else', 'altogether', 'What', 'further', 'secrets', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'more', 'importantly', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'dared', 'doing', 'something', 'settle', 'philosophical', 'debate', 'society', 'movie', 'pull', 'off', 'Joe', 'Orton', '/', 'Four', 'Rooms', 'intersecting', 'situational', 'comedy', 'Instead', 'what', 'get', 'quasi-chick', 'flick', 'never', 'quite', 'say', '1', 'female', 'roles', 'contain', 'long', 'monologues', 'reveal', 'what', 'going', 'minds', 'male', 'roles', 'are', 'completely', 'flat', 'stunted', 'dimension', '2', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'nasty', 'bad', 'way', 'person', 'was', 'straight', 'girl', 'up', 'hot', 'sexy', 'hunky', 'stranger', 'who', 'incidentally', 'very', 'little', 'whisking', 'off', 'happy', 'ending', 'nasty', 'guy', 'dealt', 'full', 'comeuppance', '3', 'Hot', 'English', 'guy', 'gratuitous', 'British', 'accent', 'American', 'girls', 'go', 'ga-ga', 'over.A', 'girl', 'realization', 'life', 'then', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'helped', 'discover', 'arrive', 'realization', 'leaving', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'own', 'devices', 'pursue', 'dreams', 'difficult', 'root', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'self-absorbed', 'own', 'happiness.Whoever', 'made', 'movie', 'really', 'SUV', 'automobile', 'target', 'trite', 'cliches', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'drive', 'one']",Park
