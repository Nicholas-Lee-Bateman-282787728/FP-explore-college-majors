The feel you get with this DVD is that someone saw all the series titled that way and threw something together to get on the band wagon.  Kind of dissappointing, not cohsive at all, and a lot of rehashed video.",3,Disappointing,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",2013,334,"['yet', 'series', 'titled', '34', 'WWII', 'color', '34', 'many', 'labeled', 'way', 'least', 'interesting', 'feel', 'get', 'DVD', 'someone', 'saw', 'series', 'titled', 'way', 'threw', 'something', 'together', 'get', 'band', 'wagon', 'Kind', 'dissappointing', 'not', 'cohsive', 'lot', 'rehashed', 'video']",WWII in Color: 2 Tape Set VHS

One is led to think this will be a WW2 narrative mostly in color but it is not quite that. It is more a collection of available color (sometimes very washed out color at that) footage on various aspects of the war.Strengths: Excellent footage of Tarawa, Midway, Okinawa and Aircraft Carrier life. The Normandy footage is certainly different and adds a bit to the overall picture.Weaknesses: This will not give you an accurate narrative of the war. Europe is nearly overlooked. The Russians hardly mentioned. The usual Eva Braun footage is used for Hitler. (It does look crisp.) Essentially this is just material that plugs in a few holes visually. One must own the World at War, The War or quite a few other documentaries to get any kind of overview picture. Nearly every drop of footage is from the American perspective. The narration hasn't got a critical or scholarly bone in it's body. The music ranges from quite interesting to ludicrous travelogue jauntiness.Who should get this? Only real WW2 students and aficionados.",3,Worthwhile but more a collection of vignettes.,1286582400,"10 9, 2010",2010,1092,"['packaging', 'several', 'different', 'covers', 'bit', 'deceptive', 'One', 'led', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'WW2', 'narrative', 'mostly', 'color', 'not', 'quite', 'more', 'collection', 'available', 'color', 'sometimes', 'very', 'washed', 'out', 'color', 'footage', 'various', 'aspects', 'war.Strengths', 'Excellent', 'footage', 'Tarawa', 'Midway', 'Okinawa', 'Aircraft', 'Carrier', 'life', 'Normandy', 'footage', 'certainly', 'different', 'bit', 'overall', 'picture.Weaknesses', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'accurate', 'narrative', 'war', 'Europe', 'nearly', 'overlooked', 'Russians', 'hardly', 'mentioned', 'usual', 'Eva', 'Braun', 'footage', 'used', 'Hitler', 'look', 'crisp', 'Essentially', 'just', 'material', 'plugs', 'few', 'holes', 'visually', 'must', 'own', 'World', 'War', 'War', 'quite', 'few', 'other', 'documentaries', 'get', 'kind', 'overview', 'picture', 'Nearly', 'drop', 'footage', 'American', 'perspective', 'narration', ""n't"", 'got', 'critical', 'scholarly', 'bone', 'body', 'music', 'quite', 'interesting', 'ludicrous', 'travelogue', 'jauntiness.Who', 'should', 'get', 'Only', 'real', 'WW2', 'students', 'aficionados']",WWII in Color: 2 Tape Set VHS

495875,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B00000DGHM,Roger J. Buffington,"[4, 6]","The Second World War was one of the great catastophes to befall humanity, and one of the greatest challenges of the United States (and, of course, its many allies).  This film essentially comprises actual color footage of key American battles and incidents of World War II, as well as some captured home movies of Adolph Hitler in his ""Eagle's Nest.""This is a very worthwhile DVD.  The narrative is unabashedly American-oriented, which fits with the film and attitudes of the times in which the films were taken.  There is something incredibly poignant about seeing actual footage of the men and boys (who would very shortly be men) going into action in places like Normandy Beach and Tarawa.  Many of these lads would not be coming back--these are not actors, this is the real deal.  Nothing can compare to this.The film holds little back; there are some pretty graphic battle scenes complete with casualties.  If the media back then had been as it is today, the press would have portrayed the victories of Tarawa, Iwo Jima, Normandy, Guadacanal, Okinawa and other tough fights as gruesome American defeats due to the heavy casualties.  This film reminds us that the price of victory is likely not to be cheap.  Not a few of us have perhaps forgotten that, and the price that others have paid on our behalf.  I will ensure that my children watch this film for that reason.By the way, on the reverse side of the DVD there is an old US Government orientation film narrated by Clark Gable.  It is a wonderful look at the attitudes of the times, as America geared up to fight the Germans over the skies of Europe.  Don't miss it.",5,As they saw it -- and we owe them so much,1128643200,"10 7, 2005",2005,1626,"['Second', 'World', 'War', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'catastophes', 'befall', 'humanity', 'one', 'greatest', 'challenges', 'United', 'States', 'course', 'many', 'allies', 'film', 'essentially', 'actual', 'color', 'footage', 'key', 'American', 'battles', 'incidents', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'as', 'well', 'captured', 'home', 'movies', 'Adolph', 'Hitler', 'Eagle', 'Nest', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'DVD', 'narrative', 'unabashedly', 'American-oriented', 'film', 'attitudes', 'times', 'films', 'were', 'taken', 'something', 'incredibly', 'poignant', 'seeing', 'actual', 'footage', 'men', 'boys', 'who', 'would', 'very', 'shortly', 'be', 'men', 'going', 'action', 'places', 'Normandy', 'Beach', 'Tarawa', 'Many', 'lads', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'coming', 'back', 'are', 'not', 'actors', 'real', 'deal', 'Nothing', 'can', 'compare', 'this.The', 'film', 'little', 'back', 'are', 'pretty', 'graphic', 'battle', 'scenes', 'complete', 'casualties', 'media', 'back', 'then', 'had', 'been', 'today', 'press', 'would', 'have', 'portrayed', 'victories', 'Tarawa', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'Normandy', 'Guadacanal', 'Okinawa', 'other', 'tough', 'fights', 'gruesome', 'American', 'defeats', 'due', 'heavy', 'casualties', 'film', 'price', 'victory', 'likely', 'not', 'be', 'cheap', 'Not', 'few', 'have', 'perhaps', 'forgotten', 'price', 'others', 'have', 'paid', 'behalf', 'will', 'ensure', 'children', 'watch', 'film', 'way', 'reverse', 'side', 'DVD', 'old', 'US', 'Government', 'orientation', 'film', 'narrated', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'wonderful', 'look', 'attitudes', 'times', 'America', 'geared', 'up', 'fight', 'Germans', 'skies', 'Europe', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss']",WWII in Color: 2 Tape Set VHS
