846981,A2ZS8TWUL1QTRH,B0002VEVR0,A.J. Dill,"[5, 16]","I personally enjoyed this series, but not as much as some other anime I have seen before. I liked the idea of the online game world. The animators took full advantage of this creating some neat character designs and some awesome scenes. The imagery of this show is great. It gives the right atmosphere at the right time, whether it's dark or happy.The music is also good. There weren't any songs that felt out of place. Voice overs were good too. Overall, I think .hack//SIGN has fantastic presentation.There were a few big problems I had with .hack//SIGN. First, there is almost no action at all. I think there are some scenes that would be much more interesting if the action was intensified, not just plain hacking or a single blast that ends the fighting. Another problem I had was the plot seemed to drag on and on, especially in the middle. The characters are often walking around in circles not gathering any decisive information on the conflict, always running into a dead end. If there was more action, then I don't think I would have noticed this as much.Third problem I had that I think is caused by the other two, is I find some of the characters extremely bland. They don't show any extreme emotion and hardly change during the course of the story. My last complaint deals with how some characters in the story seem to pop out of nowhere and are on for just a few minutes, but then are never seen again. This is probably because the series is related to a PS2 game in which these characters have been better developed, but I've never played that game.If you just want a psychological thrill ride, then you will enjoy .hack//SIGN. But if you must have action and a rapidly moving plot, then you should think twice before buying the DVDs.",2,Pretty good but not great,1109808000,"03 3, 2005",2005,1749,"['personally', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'anime', 'have', 'seen', 'liked', 'idea', 'online', 'game', 'world', 'animators', 'took', 'full', 'advantage', 'creating', 'neat', 'character', 'designs', 'awesome', 'scenes', 'imagery', 'show', 'great', 'right', 'atmosphere', 'right', 'time', 'dark', 'happy.The', 'music', 'also', 'good', 'were', ""n't"", 'songs', 'felt', 'place', 'Voice', 'overs', 'were', 'good', 'too', 'Overall', 'think', 'fantastic', 'presentation.There', 'were', 'few', 'big', 'problems', 'had', '.hack//SIGN', 'First', 'almost', 'action', 'think', 'are', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'action', 'was', 'intensified', 'not', 'just', 'plain', 'hacking', 'single', 'blast', 'fighting', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'plot', 'seemed', 'drag', 'especially', 'middle', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'walking', 'around', 'circles', 'not', 'gathering', 'decisive', 'information', 'conflict', 'always', 'running', 'dead', 'end', 'was', 'more', 'action', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'noticed', 'much.Third', 'problem', 'had', 'think', 'caused', 'other', 'two', 'find', 'characters', 'extremely', 'bland', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'extreme', 'emotion', 'hardly', 'change', 'course', 'story', 'last', 'complaint', 'deals', 'how', 'characters', 'story', 'seem', 'pop', 'nowhere', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'then', 'are', 'never', 'seen', 'again', 'probably', 'series', 'related', 'PS2', 'game', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'developed', ""'ve"", 'never', 'played', 'game.If', 'just', 'want', 'psychological', 'thrill', 'ride', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', '.hack//SIGN', 'must', 'have', 'action', 'rapidly', 'moving', 'plot', 'then', 'should', 'think', 'twice', 'buying', 'DVDs']",.hack//SIGN

846986,A1ZGOZCYNZYXUG,B0002VEVR0,Ghost,"[3, 3]","First off, I will say that I love this series, but it is not a review of the show but rather for the product and trying to bring awareness of the product's availability and bootleg problems plaguing the marketplace. This is not a seller problem, but these will be found at conventions, online retailers, and brick and mortar stores that don't know better.In 2012 Bandai Entertainment USA went out of business. Since then many bootlegs have hit the market, especially for the popular shows.These bootlegs typically come in a clear case and are nearly indistinguishable between the retail copy. These bootlegs are using the same disc count, disc art, and are copying the DVD sleeves art and information as you would see with the official retail release  1:1. This particular series was never released with clear casing and came in a thick black box. The DVDs they're using for these are DVD-5's, meaning that the max they can put on the disc is about 4.75 Gigs while the official retail releases use DVD-9's. Due to the fact it's impossible to tell by looking at the DVD set, the only way to know for sure if you have a bootleg or retail copy is to check the disc's properties in your computer.The only way you will know for sure that you got an official retail copy, will be:1. If you buy *directly* from Amazon or Rightstuf. Their warehouse stock comes directly from the publisher.2. If you buy new it will come with a security sticker.3. The final test to see if it is legit is to put it into your computer and see if the disc is less than or greater than 4.75 Gigs. If it's greater than that, then you should be good.Example: [...](note: the bootleg on the right was not an Anime Legends bootleg, so they may have copied the disc file name for these as well)I hope you found this information useful. There's not many people who know about this and I'd hate for people to continue falling prey to buying bootlegs.Not only is this happening to Bandai's Anime Legends sets, but it's also happening to Discotek Media's sets as well.Sources of information:1.

From what I understand, the events are nothing but a prologue - the background story to the game.  Instead of a tiny booklet that they always insert into the game's case, to give it some kind of history, you have a anime that is 25 episodes long, with 26th episode as a stand alone flash-back, the 27th episode as a clip show of the important moments and the 28th episode as the final ending, the final episode set after the events in the four part video game!But even without the game the ending still fits - after all, the anime is set in a online game.

846993,AFV2584U13XP3,B0002VEVR0,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[1, 1]",I found this series to be very entertaining both with the animation and soundtrack.  The series mostly deals with characters in a virtual simulated game world for people everywhere to play but this series deals with a select group of players trying to solve some mystery both inside and outside the gaming world.  The series has a very deep story depth concept but can be both hard to follow and harder to understand for the most part.  My personal feelings were that it was trying to explain that even though we have problems in the real world we can't just escape our lives and try to live in a fake or made up world sooner or later we're going to have to face them sometimes regardless if we want too.  But you most make your own opinions on this series for yourself.  The soundtrack I felt was also incredible from the people who made the soundtracks for the anime NOIR and MADLAX if you have seen either of these anime series and liked the music you will like this soundtrack as well.  The video is in wide-screen format with Japanese/English audio or just the music audiotrack  again the animation looks almost the same as with NOIR or Madlax as well but is very clear and sharp.So before this goes away I say take a chance and try this one you may just like it...I do want to give some people some information on the series about the characters Tsukasa and Subaru.  I have seen some reviews online saying how since both the characters are both female in the real world that their relationship is weird.  In no way is it suggested in the series that their relationship is romantic you have to see the whole series through and realize the life that Tsukasa had to live through and that she was merely trying to escape her pain as well as try to find something or someone that truly loved her and wouldn't just use or hurt her.  The character for Subaru seemed to realize this on some level and saw Tsukasa's pain and loneliness and wanted to help her see that there could be something better in the real world to come back to.,5,A Great Series For Most Anime Fans But Confusing As Well,1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,2031,"['found', 'series', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'series', 'mostly', 'characters', 'virtual', 'simulated', 'game', 'world', 'people', 'everywhere', 'play', 'series', 'select', 'group', 'players', 'trying', 'solve', 'mystery', 'gaming', 'world', 'series', 'very', 'deep', 'story', 'depth', 'concept', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'follow', 'harder', 'understand', 'most', 'part', 'personal', 'feelings', 'were', 'was', 'trying', 'explain', 'even', 'have', 'problems', 'real', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'escape', 'lives', 'try', 'live', 'fake', 'made', 'up', 'world', 'sooner', 'later', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'face', 'sometimes', 'regardless', 'want', 'too', 'most', 'make', 'own', 'opinions', 'series', 'soundtrack', 'felt', 'was', 'also', 'incredible', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'soundtracks', 'anime', 'NOIR', 'MADLAX', 'have', 'seen', 'anime', 'series', 'liked', 'music', 'will', 'like', 'soundtrack', 'as', 'well', 'video', 'wide-screen', 'format', 'Japanese/English', 'audio', 'just', 'music', 'audiotrack', 'again', 'animation', 'almost', 'same', 'NOIR', 'Madlax', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'clear', 'sharp.So', 'away', 'say', 'take', 'chance', 'try', 'one', 'may', 'just', 'like', 'do', 'want', 'give', 'people', 'information', 'series', 'characters', 'Tsukasa', 'Subaru', 'have', 'seen', 'reviews', 'online', 'saying', 'how', 'characters', 'are', 'female', 'real', 'world', 'relationship', 'weird', 'way', 'suggested', 'series', 'relationship', 'romantic', 'have', 'see', 'whole', 'series', 'realize', 'life', 'Tsukasa', 'had', 'live', 'was', 'merely', 'trying', 'escape', 'pain', 'as', 'well', 'try', 'find', 'something', 'someone', 'truly', 'loved', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'use', 'hurt', 'character', 'Subaru', 'seemed', 'realize', 'level', 'saw', 'Tsukasa', 'pain', 'loneliness', 'wanted', 'help', 'see', 'could', 'be', 'something', 'better', 'real', 'world', 'come', 'back']",.hack//SIGN

If you don't the plots pretty simple: A kid gets stuck in an mass multiplayer online role playing game and other characters try to find out why that happened. The series works well as a stand alone and you do not need to play the games to enjoy the series as the series is set before the games. The case to this series is pretty cool. The actual case is rectangular, probably no bigger than any anime legends case, covered but another case that contains a pad with three little pins. Covering that is the hexagon you see in the picture. I got mine used, and the only thing that bothers me is that the hexagon gets caught on the pin case which makes taking it off and putting it back on a pain.

The prequil to the video games ut can stand completely alone. Though there are still questions left unsolved. The case is your typical cardboard import without idividual cases, if you've baught alot of anime you know what I'm talking about. so if you have the extra 10 dollars and aren't stingy like me buy the other set.The music is amazing, one of the best I have ever heard. The animation is smooth, fluid and crisp. The plot is interesting and has enough twists and turn to keep you interested. The Characters are well developed and like able. Finally the philosophy though not a major player is interesting. You haven't baught it yet!?

It should be better to play lineage or something than whatch an anime who deals with characters in a online game.

846998,A2CYMGGXS5QPJT,B0002VEVR0,Yay for Music!,"[7, 8]","This story is about a virtual reality game in which the people playing the game are more than just players, they actually feel and relate through the game.For the protagonist, Tsukasa, the world is his real world ever since he went into an unconscious state in the real world and was unable to log out. Now he can feel and see things in ""The World"" that others can't. Smells, pain from wounds, fatigue from not being able to sleep, he can't do anything normal and is unable to figure out why he was trapped.First Tsukasa meets Mimiru after he fights a battle and his real self falls unconscious. He can't remember how he got stuck in the world or if he is a real person or just a character. Sympathetic and curious, Mimiru, a sword wielding girl with a big attitude tries to connect to the withdrawn and depressed Tsukasa.Next they meet a companion of Mimiru's, Bear, who is another swordsman with blue skin and wisdom. He is a fatherly figure and Tsukasa views him and other adults as ""meddling"".The other characters are the Crimson Knights, a group of online police led by a young girl named Subaru and a gruff, rule abiding, and agressive leader who serves Subaru, the Silver Knight.The founder of the knights, Crim or Crimson, quit after placing Subaru in charge and went on to play the game for fun instead of policing.At first the Crimson Knights chase Tsukasa and try to arrest and ""Bind"" him (Meaning trap his character in the game) because his new Guardian (A powerful being with Unlimited HP that does not die easily) that Tsukasa got when he lost his ability to log out, is killing other players, including the Silver Knight.Tsukasa has many problems adjusting to the world with his problem of losing more memory every time his character dies because his real self isn't conscious. He also doesn't trust others because he feels everyone is selfish.This is a good series for RPG game goers and for those who want a change in anime, this series is pretty unique.PLEASE DO NOT READ BEYOND THIS POINT IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE SERIES! WARNING: SPOILERS!!My only bone to pick is that the series ending is that after Tsukasa breaks free and gets to log out, first he forms a three person team with real players to create a new character and then comes back after his real self (A girl by the way) graduates to college. I don't get why the story didn't just end after he got out, the story introduced all these new characters that weren't at all fleshed out. The reunion and the reaction of the characters was really out of place too.Not that I don't like female characters or anything, but I think having Tsukasa be a girl in the real world, or involving the real world to be a part of the story beyond Tsukasa's dilema is a mistake. His character is completely destroyed because the conflict is over.Next, the story is about the World in the game, not the real world. So having the relationship of the characters be ruined by the revelations of the actual people is kind of weird, however interesting it is to have a girl play as the character Tsukasa, it doesn't help the relationship that Subura and Tsukasa had as characters. I liked it better if Tsukasa just became just a character in the game, that character is more powerful.Well, that's just my view of it anyways. I liked the fact that the people who played the games were more real in ""The World"" than in reality. I think bringing Tsukasa, Subaru, and Mimiru into the story as their real selves makes their game characters one demensional. They were pretty deep before then. I think a few things weren't really drawn out as much as they could have been, namely the legends of the world: Orca and Balung. And it didn't seem like the conflict was that hard to solve. I was expecting more problems.Anyways, other than the ending, this was a good series to watch. Short and sweet. Not as violent as you might expect. The graphics were made to look like an RPG, so, it's even less gory than most anime shows. It has fighting though, PKs (player killers) who just try to get the IDs of other players. And monsters.The music is excellent, I highly suggest looking for the soundtracks. And it was well mixed into the story. Good series, though incomplete, and enjoyable for all anime fans. This is one of the older series, so that animation is not as brightly colored as the others, but it's good because the it matches the tone.This is a must see, watch and enjoy if you're an anime, RPG, or looking for something new and different to watch, this is it!",4,"Excellent Story, but the ending was confusing",1181347200,"06 9, 2007",2007,4511,"['story', 'virtual', 'reality', 'game', 'people', 'playing', 'game', 'are', 'more', 'just', 'players', 'actually', 'feel', 'relate', 'game.For', 'protagonist', 'Tsukasa', 'world', 'real', 'world', 'ever', 'went', 'unconscious', 'state', 'real', 'world', 'was', 'unable', 'log', 'out', 'Now', 'can', 'feel', 'see', 'things', 'World', 'others', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Smells', 'pain', 'wounds', 'fatigue', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'sleep', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'normal', 'unable', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'was', 'trapped.First', 'Tsukasa', 'meets', 'Mimiru', 'battle', 'real', 'self', 'unconscious', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'how', 'got', 'stuck', 'world', 'real', 'person', 'just', 'character', 'Sympathetic', 'curious', 'Mimiru', 'sword', 'wielding', 'girl', 'big', 'attitude', 'tries', 'connect', 'withdrawn', 'depressed', 'Tsukasa.Next', 'meet', 'companion', 'Mimiru', 'Bear', 'who', 'swordsman', 'blue', 'skin', 'wisdom', 'fatherly', 'figure', 'Tsukasa', 'views', 'other', 'adults', 'meddling', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'Crimson', 'Knights', 'group', 'online', 'police', 'led', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Subaru', 'gruff', 'rule', 'abiding', 'agressive', 'leader', 'who', 'Subaru', 'Silver', 'Knight.The', 'founder', 'knights', 'Crim', 'Crimson', 'quit', 'placing', 'Subaru', 'charge', 'went', 'play', 'game', 'fun', 'instead', 'policing.At', 'first', 'Crimson', 'Knights', 'chase', 'Tsukasa', 'try', 'arrest', 'Bind', 'Meaning', 'trap', 'character', 'game', 'new', 'Guardian', 'powerful', 'being', 'Unlimited', 'HP', 'not', 'die', 'easily', 'Tsukasa', 'got', 'when', 'lost', 'ability', 'log', 'out', 'killing', 'other', 'players', 'including', 'Silver', 'Knight.Tsukasa', 'many', 'problems', 'adjusting', 'world', 'problem', 'losing', 'more', 'memory', 'time', 'character', 'dies', 'real', 'self', ""n't"", 'conscious', 'also', ""n't"", 'trust', 'others', 'everyone', 'selfish.This', 'good', 'series', 'RPG', 'game', 'goers', 'who', 'want', 'change', 'anime', 'series', 'pretty', 'unique.PLEASE', 'DO', 'NOT', 'READ', 'BEYOND', 'THIS', 'POINT', 'IF', 'YOU', 'HAVE', 'NOT', 'SEEN', 'THE', 'SERIES', 'WARNING', 'SPOILERS', 'only', 'bone', 'pick', 'series', 'ending', 'Tsukasa', 'breaks', 'free', 'log', 'out', 'first', 'three', 'person', 'team', 'real', 'players', 'create', 'new', 'character', 'then', 'back', 'real', 'self', 'girl', 'way', 'college', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'end', 'got', 'out', 'story', 'introduced', 'new', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'fleshed', 'out', 'reunion', 'reaction', 'characters', 'was', 'really', 'place', 'too.Not', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'female', 'characters', 'anything', 'think', 'having', 'Tsukasa', 'be', 'girl', 'real', 'world', 'involving', 'real', 'world', 'be', 'part', 'story', 'Tsukasa', 'dilema', 'mistake', 'character', 'completely', 'destroyed', 'conflict', 'over.Next', 'story', 'World', 'game', 'not', 'real', 'world', 'So', 'having', 'relationship', 'characters', 'be', 'ruined', 'revelations', 'actual', 'people', 'kind', 'weird', 'however', 'interesting', 'have', 'girl', 'play', 'character', 'Tsukasa', ""n't"", 'help', 'relationship', 'Subura', 'Tsukasa', 'had', 'characters', 'liked', 'better', 'Tsukasa', 'just', 'became', 'just', 'character', 'game', 'character', 'more', 'powerful.Well', 'just', 'view', 'liked', 'fact', 'people', 'who', 'played', 'games', 'were', 'more', 'real', 'World', 'reality', 'think', 'bringing', 'Tsukasa', 'Subaru', 'Mimiru', 'story', 'real', 'selves', 'game', 'characters', 'one', 'demensional', 'were', 'pretty', 'deep', 'then', 'think', 'few', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'drawn', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'namely', 'legends', 'world', 'Orca', 'Balung', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'conflict', 'was', 'hard', 'solve', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'problems.Anyways', 'other', 'ending', 'was', 'good', 'series', 'watch', 'Short', 'sweet', 'Not', 'as', 'violent', 'might', 'expect', 'graphics', 'were', 'made', 'look', 'RPG', 'so', 'even', 'less', 'gory', 'most', 'anime', 'shows', 'fighting', 'PKs', 'player', 'killers', 'who', 'just', 'try', 'get', 'IDs', 'other', 'players', 'monsters.The', 'music', 'excellent', 'highly', 'suggest', 'looking', 'soundtracks', 'was', 'well', 'mixed', 'story', 'Good', 'series', 'incomplete', 'enjoyable', 'anime', 'fans', 'one', 'older', 'series', 'animation', 'not', 'as', 'brightly', 'colored', 'others', 'good', 'tone.This', 'must', 'see', 'watch', 'enjoy', ""'re"", 'anime', 'RPG', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'different', 'watch']",.hack//SIGN
