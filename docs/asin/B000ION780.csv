Billy Zane (Critters, Dead Calm, Memory) plays the dad who must face the hideous horde w/ the help of his daughter, her boyfriend, and a few other survivors. The first half is my favorite, as Zane and company are hilarious. Things drag a bit in the mid-section, but there are enough funny parts to keep things rolling. Besides, how often do you get a chance to see a hamburger patty crawl around, bubble green goo, and fly onto someone's face?...",4,"""They Ate My Foot!""...",1241740800,"05 8, 2009",2009,532,"['MAD', 'family', 'vacation', 'interupted', 'hamburger-induced', 'zombie', 'invasion', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'Critters', 'Dead', 'Calm', 'Memory', 'dad', 'who', 'must', 'face', 'hideous', 'horde', 'w/', 'help', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'few', 'other', 'survivors', 'first', 'half', 'favorite', 'Zane', 'company', 'are', 'hilarious', 'Things', 'drag', 'bit', 'mid-section', 'are', 'enough', 'funny', 'parts', 'keep', 'things', 'rolling', 'Besides', 'how', 'often', 'do', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'hamburger', 'patty', 'crawl', 'bubble', 'green', 'goo', 'fly', 'someone', 'face']",The Mad Unrated

I generally go &#34;eh&#34; when I hear a movie with him in it.  But Zane really has a great thing when it comes to playing qurky type characters.  And this movie he plays it to the hilt.When Zane's character takes his girlfriend and his daughter & her boyfriend on a trip to get to know his daughter better, hillarity results.  They stop at a small town diner to eat, when a &#34;Zombie Outbreak&#34; happens.  From there comedy happens.I love watching this film & just having a good laugh.

1022075,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B000ION780,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[3, 5]","THE MADI have to say that this ranks way up there with any zombie movie I have ever seen, particularly the comedy ones. I don't think it would be my favorite but it is up there with them for sure, more of a tongue n check type film. There is a lot of intellectual humor in this film and the performances feel real, which usually does not happen.  This is the type of film that you would watch with some close friends on a weekend night expecting something really bad, but to your surprise you would actually end up liking. If that has happened to you lately chances are you were watching this movie. This is a campy, fun, and humorous film that really should have caught on better, I think it will eventually become something of a cult classic.Writer/director/producer John Kalangis and co-writers Kevin Hennelly have written a very funny yet intellectual piece, well as far as a zombie movie goes. The film moves at a nice pace and has a lot of good moments through out, good gore scenes as well. While there is a lot of good laughs to be had with just words and facial expressions there are some good laughs based off of some of the gory zombie moments.  One headless moment in particular is a personal favorite of mine I am sure you will like it as well, of course there are other great moments. But the film makers balance things out nicely with a mix of horror and humor although I thought this film was straight hilarious, so maybe more so on the humor side of things. A scene involving Billy Zane were he tells his daughters boyfriend to watch his mouth about his now dead girl friend is probably one of the funniest scenes in the film.Acting wise this film is top notch and I can't really complain about anybody that was in front of the camera on this flick. Billy Zane was absolutely perfect in his role of the dad that is with a new woman that his daughter disapproves of and feels is trying to change her father. I have always been a big fan of Billy Zane and he was always one of my favorite actors ever [his performance in ""Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight"" is still far and above excellent]. His dry wit and delivery of the character is perfect and I can't wait to see him in this genre again. Maggie Castle is real good as his daughter although her character may drive you crazy at first, and every other actor in this film is just as good as the ones mentioned above. It seems every person involved really came onto this film to create a great movie.Over all this is an excellent film that I would recommend to every one that reads this, I found it really entertaining. This is a really funny movie and if you enjoyed other zombie comedies I am sure you will like this one as well. Of course any time a guy [who is a doctor] straps on some gloves to cut up his dead girl friend [who was just killed by screwdriver or knife to the head and munched on by some zombies] and examine her and says ""She always supported my career"" will always be a classic in my eyes.",5,BILLY ZANE + ZOMBIES = CLASSIC,1225756800,"11 4, 2008",2008,2979,"['MADI', 'have', 'say', 'way', 'there', 'zombie', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'particularly', 'comedy', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'favorite', 'there', 'sure', 'more', 'tongue', 'n', 'check', 'type', 'film', 'lot', 'intellectual', 'humor', 'film', 'performances', 'feel', 'real', 'usually', 'not', 'happen', 'type', 'film', 'would', 'watch', 'close', 'friends', 'weekend', 'night', 'expecting', 'something', 'really', 'bad', 'surprise', 'would', 'actually', 'end', 'up', 'liking', 'happened', 'lately', 'chances', 'are', 'were', 'watching', 'movie', 'campy', 'fun', 'humorous', 'film', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'caught', 'better', 'think', 'will', 'eventually', 'become', 'something', 'cult', 'classic.Writer/director/producer', 'John', 'Kalangis', 'co-writers', 'Kevin', 'Hennelly', 'have', 'written', 'very', 'funny', 'yet', 'intellectual', 'piece', 'well', 'as', 'far', 'zombie', 'movie', 'film', 'moves', 'nice', 'pace', 'lot', 'good', 'moments', 'good', 'gore', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'good', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'just', 'words', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'good', 'laughs', 'based', 'gory', 'zombie', 'moments', 'One', 'headless', 'moment', 'particular', 'personal', 'favorite', 'mine', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'course', 'are', 'other', 'great', 'moments', 'film', 'makers', 'balance', 'things', 'out', 'nicely', 'mix', 'horror', 'humor', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'straight', 'hilarious', 'so', 'maybe', 'more', 'so', 'humor', 'side', 'things', 'scene', 'involving', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'were', 'daughters', 'boyfriend', 'watch', 'mouth', 'now', 'dead', 'girl', 'friend', 'probably', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'film.Acting', 'wise', 'film', 'top', 'notch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'complain', 'anybody', 'was', 'front', 'camera', 'flick', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'was', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'role', 'dad', 'new', 'woman', 'daughter', 'disapproves', 'feels', 'trying', 'change', 'father', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'was', 'always', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'ever', '[', 'performance', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'Demon', 'Knight', 'still', 'far', 'above', 'excellent', ']', 'dry', 'wit', 'delivery', 'character', 'perfect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'genre', 'again', 'Maggie', 'Castle', 'real', 'good', 'daughter', 'character', 'may', 'drive', 'crazy', 'first', 'other', 'actor', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'ones', 'mentioned', 'person', 'involved', 'really', 'came', 'film', 'create', 'great', 'movie.Over', 'excellent', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'one', 'found', 'really', 'entertaining', 'really', 'funny', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'zombie', 'comedies', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'like', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'course', 'time', 'guy', '[', 'who', 'doctor', ']', 'straps', 'gloves', 'cut', 'up', 'dead', 'girl', 'friend', '[', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'killed', 'screwdriver', 'knife', 'head', 'munched', 'zombies', ']', 'examine', 'always', 'supported', 'career', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'classic', 'eyes']",The Mad Unrated

After recently watching a string of zombie movies that cannot be easily squeezed into the standard zombie-movie mold (""Undead,"" ""Last of the Living,"" ""Days of Darkness,"" ""Dead Meat""), I can now add to it a zombie/comedy that also sits outside the box.  ""The Mad"" is surreal in its execution - from the infra-red look of the scenery to the consumerism of the zombies to the off-the-wall characters and on up to the exquisite absent-mindedness of Billy Zane's character.  And, best of all, it works.  Together, these elements produce a tapestry as funny, as scary and as creepy as any zombie movie I've ever seen.  The only let-down is that the mad cows do not rampage; they merely push one another aside to get to the special feed the farmer has given them; but, to make up for it, the meat patties they produce do rampage.

Underneath the charm of small-town living a strange horror is about to burst forth.  Tainted meat is going to affect the locals and turn them into zombies (or are they zombies?).

As they are besieged by the mad killers they work up a plan of escape and how to stop the menace from spreading.  Will they succeed?

Here he's the absolute antithesis of the amped up character he played in DEMON KNIGHT but it still works. Zane plays a rather quite, restrained medical doctor who is vacationing with his daughter Amy (Maggie Castle), her boyfried, and his own prospective second wife Monica (Shauna MacDonald) who is very much at odds with teenage Amy. Against his better judgment they stop at a small town where some sort of country fair seems to be taking place, his girlfriend read an article about the town in which it was referred to as ""hillbilly nouveau""--very chic apparently, so there's no getting out of it.What none of them know however, is that the $16.95 hamburger special made from local ""free range"" cattle is not what it seems and before long everybody who has eaten one is foaming at the mouth and attacking all those who haven't. Naturally this brings up the discussion of whether or not they are really zombies or not--a subject they decide to leave for another time.  Ultimately they learn that all the tainted meat came from one area farm and they decide that some course of action should be taken, and all sorts of bloody comic mayhem ensues. There is one especially funny scene involving father/daughter bonding as they casually fight for their lives in a field of zombies that can justifiably be called classic.Written by Kevin Hennelly and directed by John Kalagis, THE MAD has a few new twists to offer the genre if only in the form of characterization. Haven't you always wanted to see at least ONE person keep their head on straight and think rationally during a zombie attack? Well Zane's your boy. He's virtually unflappable, even going so far as to discuss with  Monica what dress she should be buried in as he performs an autopsy on her to see if he can learn more about the disease that's infecting everyone!

This movie was not entertaining in the least.. I don't see where anyone found this funny. If your sense of humor is all about people wading through zombies holding monotone conversation and cracking flat jokes, then your ready to split a rib here. But I for one felt like the script was written in about two hours by someone with very, very, very poor writing skills. Billy Zane and company stroll through the story babbling and mumbling, while they split zombie heads and even tango with them.

In fact, I think this is a spoof on serious zombie films.Zane is OK, but I think he was miscast - anyway, I wasn't convinced he was a doctor. Fortunately, he doesn't ruin the fun.  As far as the rest of the cast goes, they're perfect.  This is not the kind of movie that would benefit from Academy Award winning performances and all these actors understand exactly what the film needs from them, and they deliver.Not extremely scary or gory, but still, probably not for the squeamish.

I had heard it was bad because it included man eating hamburger patties. That isn't the half of it. It isn't the half of it either that Billy Zane plays the part as if he is sneering at the production. The acting by adults is even OK; and I would label the idea of zombies produced by a mad cow-like disease as pretty good. What makes the movie truly bad is a stream of consciousness script that often disconnects totally from the plot. I remember one scene in particular where Billy Zane and his daughter alternated between talking about their relationship and fighting zombies. There are a number of scenes like that.

1022088,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000ION780,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","The Mad (John Kalangis, 2007)It seems a lot of people hated Kalangis' third feature film (following Jack and Jill and Love Is Work); I can kind of understand why, but I'm certainly not one of them. I found The Mad to be a brilliant send-up of the current zombie-movie craze, delivering as many stupid laughs per minute as Kalangis, Kevin Hennelly, and Christopher Smets could jam into their screenplay. Yeah, it's dumb-- that's the whole point.The Mad is about a family-to-be-- father Jason Hunt (Billy Zane), daughter Amy Hunt (Maggie Castle), Jason's fiancee Monica Tepper (Shauna McDonald), and Amy's somewhat slow boyfriend Blake (Evan Charles Flock). At Monica's insistence, they stop at a ""nouveau hillbilly"" resort near a farm whose ""organic"" meat is anything but. Needless to say, the burger special at the resort's diner is the cause of all the anarchy to come; after some wonderful parodies of Lifetime Original Movie-style stepmother-attempting-to-bond-with-teen-who-doesn't-like-her and the like, those who ate the burgers go insane (Note that, like such recent ""zombie"" movies as 28 Days Later..., the ""zombies"" here are not actual zombies.), leaving our family unit, the diner owner (Rothaford Gray), and his daughter Steve (Jordan Madley) to figure out what's going on and get to the bottom of things.I've read a few reviews that get all up in arms about Billy Zane's character's lack of reaction to the events that go on around him. But, you see, that's what it's all about; a horde of zombies attacking him isn't nearly as important to him as is bonding with his daughter. The zombies are just a problem to be solved pragmatically. I've been dying for a movie to have a protagonist like that for years. You don't really think that in an age when everyone and his mother has seen dozens of zombie films, we're all going to be running around like chickens with our heads cut off when the dead rise from their graves, do you? Of course not, we're going to go out and stock up on guns, ammo, and machetes, and put the wandering [censored for Amazon consumption] back in their graves, that's what we're going to do. Just think of Jason Hunt as an advance wave of zombie fighters-- the new guard, as it were.Of course, that doesn't mean the dichotomy can't be squeezed for its humor value; there's still a cognitive dissonance in ""oh, yeah, a zombie. Now, you know Blake's just not your type, right?"". The screenwriters milked it for all it's worth, and I thought they did a fantastic job of it. Don't take it seriously and you'll have a fabulous time with this overlooked gem. ****",4,Fantastically fun.,1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,2593,"['Mad', 'John', 'Kalangis', '2007', 'lot', 'people', 'hated', 'Kalangis', 'third', 'feature', 'film', 'following', 'Jack', 'Jill', 'Love', 'Is', 'Work', 'can', 'kind', 'understand', 'why', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'found', 'Mad', 'be', 'brilliant', 'send-up', 'current', 'zombie-movie', 'craze', 'delivering', 'many', 'stupid', 'laughs', 'minute', 'Kalangis', 'Kevin', 'Hennelly', 'Christopher', 'Smets', 'could', 'jam', 'screenplay', 'Yeah', 'dumb', 'whole', 'point.The', 'Mad', 'family-to-be', 'Jason', 'Hunt', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'daughter', 'Amy', 'Hunt', 'Maggie', 'Castle', 'Jason', 'fiancee', 'Monica', 'Tepper', 'Shauna', 'McDonald', 'Amy', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'boyfriend', 'Blake', 'Evan', 'Charles', 'Flock', 'Monica', 'insistence', 'stop', 'nouveau', 'hillbilly', 'resort', 'farm', 'organic', 'meat', 'anything', 'Needless', 'say', 'burger', 'special', 'resort', 'diner', 'cause', 'anarchy', 'come', 'wonderful', 'parodies', 'Lifetime', 'Original', 'Movie-style', ""stepmother-attempting-to-bond-with-teen-who-doesn't-like-her"", 'like', 'who', 'ate', 'burgers', 'go', 'insane', 'Note', 'such', 'recent', 'zombie', 'movies', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'zombies', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'actual', 'zombies', 'leaving', 'family', 'unit', 'diner', 'owner', 'Rothaford', 'Gray', 'daughter', 'Steve', 'Jordan', 'Madley', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'get', 'bottom', 'things.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'few', 'reviews', 'get', 'up', 'arms', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'character', 'lack', 'reaction', 'events', 'go', 'see', 'what', 'horde', 'zombies', 'attacking', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'important', 'bonding', 'daughter', 'zombies', 'are', 'just', 'problem', 'be', 'solved', 'pragmatically', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dying', 'movie', 'have', 'protagonist', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'age', 'when', 'everyone', 'mother', 'seen', 'dozens', 'zombie', 'films', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'running', 'chickens', 'heads', 'cut', 'off', 'when', 'dead', 'rise', 'graves', 'do', 'course', 'not', ""'re"", 'going', 'go', 'out', 'stock', 'up', 'guns', 'ammo', 'machetes', 'put', 'wandering', '[', 'censored', 'Amazon', 'consumption', ']', 'back', 'graves', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'Just', 'think', 'Jason', 'Hunt', 'advance', 'wave', 'zombie', 'fighters', 'new', 'guard', 'course', ""n't"", 'mean', 'dichotomy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'squeezed', 'humor', 'value', 'still', 'cognitive', 'dissonance', 'oh', 'yeah', 'zombie', 'Now', 'know', 'Blake', 'just', 'not', 'type', 'right', 'screenwriters', 'milked', 'worth', 'thought', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fabulous', 'time', 'overlooked', 'gem', '****']",The Mad Unrated

Billy Zane seemed to really have fun doing this movie, and it makes ya wonder how much of his character was scripted and how much of it was him, ""hamming"" it up. A lot of character development in this movie and the actors all seemed to enjoy doing the ""slapstick"" in this movie.2) MAKE UP & SPECIAL EFFECTS--No issues here. A good amount of blood and gore is thrown around and the zombies look pretty good. Speaking of zombies...3) THE ZOMBIES--Nothing new to see here. Good makeup, minimal use of the ""white faced, raccoon eyed zombie make up that seems to be in abundance nowadays. The zombies aren't runners, but they are very aggresive when attempting to chow on various peoples.4) THE CAUSE--This is our little morality lesson for the day. The farmer that provides the beef to the town is using some very un-organic chemicals to fatten the livestock so he gets more money for his produce and gets away with it, due to some loophole in the USDA's guidelines. Anyone who eats any of his tainted meat begins their transformation into a blood-thirsty zombie. Usually, it's the big corporation taking advantage of the little business guy trying to hold his own, but this time, it's just one guy (and his son) out to make a quick buck at the expense of others. The survivors feel they need to make this situation ""right"" and head off to the farm where it all began to stop it all, instead of just hightailing it out of town.5) SOUNDTRACK--Done by a Canadian group named Half Past Four. The movie ends up with a fun 1980's sound, but when the bass begins, it's turned up so obnoxiously loud and forces you to grab the remote control to try and balance out the music in between the talking and regular chomp fests. No heavy metal thrash, though.6) CONTINUITY--Only one real thing stood out. Near the end, when Jason turns the lights on at the farm, the plaster on Johnny's forehead is gone, leaving his wound visable. A little bit later, it has reappeared covering up the wound again.Overall, a fun little entry in the ""zomedy"" genre, in the same vein as Shaun of the Dead.
