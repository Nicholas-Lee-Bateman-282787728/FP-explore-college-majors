And if you are like me, and I think you are if you are reading this, you have everything that FZ and the ZFT has put out in the market already, so this is a four star based on this information...We would, I speak for a lot of FZ fans, love to have the ZFT put this out proper.  The music deserves it, the fans deserve it, and obviously FZ wanted to do it or he would not have filmed it.  So, do us all a favor DZ, GZ and put this out so I can toss this bad copy of very good music into the bin.Mondo",4,"Okay, I know it is a copy.",1255564800,"10 15, 2009",2009,634,"['Yes', 'copy', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'not', 'authorized', 'ZFT', 'good', 'music', 'Hell', 'great', 'music', 'are', 'think', 'are', 'are', 'reading', 'have', 'everything', 'FZ', 'ZFT', 'put', 'out', 'market', 'already', 'four', 'star', 'based', 'information', 'would', 'speak', 'lot', 'FZ', 'fans', 'love', 'have', 'ZFT', 'put', 'out', 'proper', 'music', 'fans', 'deserve', 'obviously', 'FZ', 'wanted', 'do', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'filmed', 'So', 'do', 'favor', 'DZ', 'GZ', 'put', 'so', 'can', 'toss', 'bad', 'copy', 'very', 'good', 'music', 'bin.Mondo']",Zappa In Barcelona: European Tour May 1988
1124075,A3BK1TF3W0867C,B00104AZ5U,Jerbear,"[1, 1]",This is a band that was close to Frank's heart. You can tell by this show just how good this group is. A nice mix of songs from throughout Frank's catalog so far. This is a straight show no overdups this is what was heard that night as they played. The band is very tight but having fun with the music as well. Frank used humor in his not only to make a point but also to entertain as well. These guys are good listen to I Am the Walrus it is spot on. Now of course I am a big Frank Zappa fan and have been following his music from the beginning so I was already sold on this before I heard it but this is a special threat to not hear these guys but to watch them as well. If you would like to hear Frank at his best then this one is for you.,5,this is the band that Frank called the best band you never heard of,1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,742,"['band', 'was', 'close', 'Frank', 'heart', 'can', 'tell', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'group', 'nice', 'mix', 'songs', 'Frank', 'catalog', 'so', 'far', 'straight', 'show', 'overdups', 'was', 'heard', 'that', 'night', 'played', 'band', 'very', 'tight', 'having', 'fun', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'Frank', 'used', 'humor', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'point', 'also', 'entertain', 'as', 'well', 'guys', 'are', 'good', 'listen', 'Am', 'Walrus', 'spot', 'Now', 'course', 'am', 'big', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'fan', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'music', 'beginning', 'so', 'was', 'already', 'sold', 'heard', 'special', 'threat', 'not', 'hear', 'guys', 'watch', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'like', 'hear', 'Frank', 'best', 'then', 'one']",Zappa In Barcelona: European Tour May 1988
1124076,A1Y80VJ4QTU6TL,B00104AZ5U,"J. Garaguso ""progressive sounds""","[0, 0]","This is difficult to rate.  This performance was from the 1988 tour that has been regarded as one of the best live bands Frank ever took out on tour.  It was the band behind such great cds as The Best Band You Never Heard In Your Life, Broadway The Hard Way and Make A Jazz Noise Here as well as some performances on the later YCDTOSA discs.  That alone should make this a worthwhile investment.  This DVD only received 3 stars from me for a few reasons.  First off the multi-generational copies that are being sold from vendors really makes for a tough video to watch.  I didn't notice the sound drop out on my copy as much as other reviewers did but maybe I just didn't pay attention. Possibly some discs are worse than others. The disc for sale here says it's only 90 minutes long. That may be a mistake as the copy I purchased quite a while ago is over 2 hours long.  Though I did purchase it elsewhere.  You can download for free the 2 hour plus performance off You Tube if you like and the picture is remarkably clean.  I've been watching it for a better part of an hour now and I haven't noticed any sound problems. All in all I am genuinely pleased with the quality of the sound and picture of the download.  I'm watching it on a large screen high def monitor and it looks and sounds great.  I don't necessarily agree or support pirated material but if Gail and the ZFT clan don't see fit to ever release this material, I'm not going to pass up the opportunity to grab it.  (ZFT clan, where are The Roxy performances??)  When I purchased this way back when I did assume it had some ties to Frank or the FZT.  Apparently not.  On a side note, you may want to pick up a copy of the new book by Andrew Greenaway called ""Zappa The Hard Way"".  It documents the 1988 tour.  It's a great book and is full of interviews with the band and FZ himself.",3,Great concert but....,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,1849,"['difficult', 'rate', 'performance', 'was', '1988', 'tour', 'been', 'regarded', 'one', 'best', 'live', 'bands', 'Frank', 'ever', 'took', 'out', 'tour', 'was', 'band', 'such', 'great', 'cds', 'Best', 'Band', 'Never', 'Heard', 'Your', 'Life', 'Broadway', 'Hard', 'Way', 'Make', 'Jazz', 'Noise', 'Here', 'as', 'well', 'performances', 'later', 'YCDTOSA', 'discs', 'alone', 'should', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'investment', 'DVD', 'only', 'received', '3', 'stars', 'few', 'reasons', 'First', 'multi-generational', 'copies', 'are', 'being', 'sold', 'vendors', 'really', 'tough', 'video', 'watch', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'sound', 'drop', 'copy', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'reviewers', 'did', 'maybe', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'Possibly', 'discs', 'are', 'worse', 'others', 'disc', 'sale', 'here', 'only', '90', 'minutes', 'long', 'may', 'be', 'mistake', 'copy', 'purchased', 'quite', 'while', 'ago', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'did', 'purchase', 'elsewhere', 'can', 'download', 'free', '2', 'hour', 'performance', 'Tube', 'like', 'picture', 'remarkably', 'clean', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'better', 'part', 'hour', 'now', 'have', ""n't"", 'noticed', 'sound', 'problems', 'am', 'genuinely', 'pleased', 'quality', 'sound', 'picture', 'download', ""'m"", 'watching', 'large', 'screen', 'high', 'def', 'monitor', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'agree', 'support', 'pirated', 'material', 'Gail', 'ZFT', 'clan', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'fit', 'ever', 'release', 'material', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'pass', 'up', 'opportunity', 'grab', 'ZFT', 'clan', 'where', 'are', 'Roxy', 'performances', 'When', 'purchased', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'did', 'assume', 'had', 'ties', 'Frank', 'FZT', 'Apparently', 'not', 'side', 'note', 'may', 'want', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'new', 'book', 'Andrew', 'Greenaway', 'called', 'Zappa', 'Hard', 'Way', 'documents', '1988', 'tour', 'great', 'book', 'full', 'interviews', 'band', 'FZ']",Zappa In Barcelona: European Tour May 1988
1124077,A1MHTHU9A6OFN3,B00104AZ5U,"JP ""ZappaFan""","[1, 1]","Too bad so many of you folks got a (apparently) bad copy, mine is definitely better than the hi-fi VHS tape it replaced. In fact I think that's exactly what it is, a VERY well done job of capturing a 1st gen VHS, or maybe even from the source tapes themselves. (Though the VHS I had still had a few Spanish TV commercials, which was pretty cool the first few times I watched it).And it is also better than the bootleg DVD a friend downloaded from the Internet several years ago and burned on a DVDr, which might be what many of you are getting (I bought mine right here on Amazon from a 3rd party vendor).There are 2 sound drop-outs on mine but, if my memory of the VHS is correct, are right before (or after) commercial breaks. So, yes, both were on both the VHS and the bootleg DVDr so are probably on the source as well and can't be fixed unless ZFT has their audio tapes (which I'm sure they do, Frank was recording EVERYTHING by then).I can also say it is better looking and sounding than a good half-dozen concert DVDs I have that ARE official releases.Until the ZFT pulls their collective heads out and officially release this, or any show from the 88 tour, I was MORE than happy to spend $12 on it!!So, until there's an alternate choice, 4 stars from me. When there's another version to compare it to, well, we'll see!",4,Until there's an alternative I'm happy to give this 4 stars.,1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2012,1326,"['Too', 'bad', 'so', 'many', 'folks', 'got', 'apparently', 'bad', 'copy', 'mine', 'definitely', 'better', 'hi-fi', 'VHS', 'tape', 'replaced', 'fact', 'think', 'exactly', 'what', 'VERY', 'well', 'done', 'job', 'capturing', '1st', 'gen', 'VHS', 'maybe', 'even', 'source', 'VHS', 'had', 'still', 'had', 'few', 'Spanish', 'TV', 'commercials', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'watched', 'also', 'better', 'bootleg', 'DVD', 'friend', 'downloaded', 'Internet', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'burned', 'DVDr', 'might', 'be', 'what', 'many', 'are', 'getting', 'bought', 'mine', 'right', 'here', 'Amazon', '3rd', 'party', 'vendor', 'are', '2', 'sound', 'drop-outs', 'mine', 'memory', 'VHS', 'correct', 'are', 'right', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'So', 'yes', 'were', 'VHS', 'bootleg', 'DVDr', 'so', 'are', 'probably', 'source', 'as', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'fixed', 'ZFT', 'audio', 'tapes', ""'m"", 'sure', 'do', 'Frank', 'was', 'recording', 'EVERYTHING', 'then', '.I', 'can', 'also', 'say', 'better', 'looking', 'sounding', 'good', 'half-dozen', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'have', 'ARE', 'official', 'releases.Until', 'ZFT', 'collective', 'heads', 'out', 'officially', 'release', 'show', '88', 'tour', 'was', 'MORE', 'happy', 'spend', '12', 'So', 'alternate', 'choice', '4', 'stars', 'When', 'version', 'compare', 'well', ""'ll"", 'see']",Zappa In Barcelona: European Tour May 1988
