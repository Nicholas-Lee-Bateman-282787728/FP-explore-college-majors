Davis is in love with composer Claude Rains, but suddenly encounters the man she's loved in the past (Paul Henreid) - and the vicious triangle is set up. The old love hasn't died, and she marries Henreid, but decides to keep her affair with Rains a secret from him. Rains is insanely jealous and hurt by her sudden marriage and attempts revenge: he threatens to tell Henreid everything. Davis shoots him just before a big concert (Henreid is a cellist about to premier a new work by Henreid - what a coincidence!).Some of this doesn't make sense: why the big secret? And hardest of all to figure out is why does she shoot Rains and then tell Henreid everythng anyway? The script, especially the dialogue is prety weak and lifeless, though Rains manages to shine. What's lacking most in this picture is inspiration.",3,Leaves some major questions un-answered,1134691200,"12 16, 2005",2005,929,"['typical', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'potboiler', 'one', 'pot', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'reach', 'boiling', 'point', 'flat', 'Davis', 'love', 'composer', 'Claude', 'Rains', 'suddenly', 'man', 'loved', 'past', 'Paul', 'Henreid', 'vicious', 'triangle', 'set', 'up', 'old', 'love', ""n't"", 'died', 'Henreid', 'keep', 'affair', 'Rains', 'secret', 'Rains', 'insanely', 'jealous', 'hurt', 'sudden', 'marriage', 'attempts', 'revenge', 'tell', 'Henreid', 'everything', 'Davis', 'shoots', 'just', 'big', 'concert', 'Henreid', 'cellist', 'premier', 'new', 'work', 'Henreid', 'what', 'coincidence', '.Some', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'why', 'big', 'secret', 'hardest', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'shoot', 'Rains', 'then', 'tell', 'Henreid', 'everythng', 'anyway', 'script', 'especially', 'dialogue', 'prety', 'weak', 'lifeless', 'Rains', 'shine', 'What', 'lacking', 'most', 'picture', 'inspiration']",N/A

257937,A1345VRK5MYG7,630160086X,James L.,"[4, 8]","Looks like I'm going to go against quite a few of the other reviewers for this film by not praising it wildly.  The story is quite basic.  Pianist Bette Davis reunites with former love Paul Henreid, a cellist, hiding from him her love affair with composer and musical genius Claude Rains.  Of course, one lie naturally leads to others, until she finds herself backed into a corner trying to save her marriage and her husband's future.  All of this is played against a backdrop of unreal sets and dramatically charged classical music.  The whole premise is a difficult one to believe, although it is buried beneath lots of bravado acting, interesting dialogue, and sometimes laughable bits of conflict and action.  Rains seems to be having a great time as the flamboyant, manipulative composer, biting into the dialogue and exploiting it for all its worth.  He overpowers his co-stars, but he and Davis are good together.  Henreid attempts to give more of a performance than I have seen in other films, but he never stands a chance with this cast.  For me the grand gestures, the grand acting, the grand music, the grand dialogue was ... well ... too grand!  Director Irving Rapper needed to get a better handle on the film.  It seems a little out of control.  It's not a horrible film, but by the end I found myself thinking, &quot;What was that all about?!?!?&quot;",3,Subtle It Ain't,1029456000,"08 16, 2002",2002,1366,"['Looks', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'quite', 'few', 'other', 'reviewers', 'film', 'not', 'praising', 'wildly', 'story', 'quite', 'basic', 'Pianist', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'former', 'love', 'Paul', 'Henreid', 'cellist', 'hiding', 'love', 'affair', 'composer', 'musical', 'genius', 'Claude', 'Rains', 'course', 'one', 'lie', 'naturally', 'others', 'backed', 'corner', 'trying', 'save', 'marriage', 'husband', 'future', 'played', 'backdrop', 'unreal', 'sets', 'dramatically', 'charged', 'classical', 'music', 'whole', 'premise', 'difficult', 'one', 'believe', 'buried', 'beneath', 'lots', 'bravado', 'acting', 'interesting', 'dialogue', 'sometimes', 'laughable', 'bits', 'conflict', 'action', 'be', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'flamboyant', 'manipulative', 'composer', 'biting', 'dialogue', 'exploiting', 'worth', 'co-stars', 'Davis', 'are', 'good', 'together', 'Henreid', 'attempts', 'give', 'more', 'performance', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'never', 'chance', 'cast', 'grand', 'gestures', 'grand', 'acting', 'grand', 'music', 'grand', 'dialogue', 'was', 'well', 'too', 'grand', 'Director', 'Irving', 'Rapper', 'needed', 'get', 'better', 'handle', 'film', 'little', 'control', 'not', 'horrible', 'film', 'end', 'found', 'thinking', 'quot', 'What', 'was', 'quot']",N/A
257938,A1L43KWWR05PCS,630160086X,Lawyeraau,"[24, 25]","This is a stylish and intriguing film about a pianist, Christine Radcliffe, who has an affair with her benefactor, the wealthy and reknowned composer, Alex Hollenius. She began this affair years after she had fled World War II Europe, leaving behind the then love of her life, cellist Karel Novak, whom she believed to have been killed in the war.One day she discovers that Novak is stateside and playing his cello at a college concert. She goes, hoping against hope, and discovers her long lost lover, and it is as if they had never been parted. She brings him to her stylish and sophisticated home, where he sees traces of another man having been there in an intimate sort of way. He is suspicious, though Christine avows her love for him.They decide to marry immediately, and do so, throwing a celebratory party which is the epitome of post war chic and is crashed by Alex Hellonius, the now spurned former lover. Hellonius happens to be one of Novak's favorite composers, but his somewhat outrageous behavior at the party at first puzzles Novak. Novak finally catches on that there must have been something going on between Christine and Hellonius, but Christine denies it, saying that he was merely her benefactor.A cat and mouse game ensues between Hellonius and Christine with the emotionally fragile Novak as the unwitting the pawn. Hellonius taunts Christine under the guise of friendship and musical sponsorship of Novak. Christine suspects that Hellonius is up to no good and is worried. He taunts her, until she believes that she can no longer maintain the deception. She then resorts to a solution that will prove to be unnecessarily final.Bette Davis is excellent in her role, but Claude Rains pulls out all the stops. How he did not get an Academy Award for his performance, I will never know. He is sensational as the egotistical, clever, and utterly brilliant composer. Paul Henreid gives a fine performance as the war scarred, sensitive cellist, but is somewhat overshadowed by his co-stars. This is a must see film for all Bette Davis fans and classic film lovers. The film will also turn the viewer into a die hard Claude Rains fan.",4,CLAUDE RAINS STEALS THE SHOW FROM BETTE DAVIS...,1005523200,"11 12, 2001",2001,2152,"['stylish', 'intriguing', 'film', 'pianist', 'Christine', 'Radcliffe', 'who', 'affair', 'benefactor', 'wealthy', 'reknowned', 'composer', 'Alex', 'Hollenius', 'began', 'affair', 'years', 'had', 'fled', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Europe', 'leaving', 'then', 'love', 'life', 'cellist', 'Karel', 'Novak', 'whom', 'believed', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'war.One', 'day', 'Novak', 'stateside', 'playing', 'cello', 'college', 'concert', 'hoping', 'hope', 'long', 'lost', 'lover', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'parted', 'stylish', 'sophisticated', 'home', 'where', 'traces', 'man', 'having', 'been', 'intimate', 'sort', 'way', 'suspicious', 'Christine', 'love', 'him.They', 'decide', 'marry', 'immediately', 'do', 'so', 'throwing', 'celebratory', 'party', 'epitome', 'post', 'war', 'chic', 'crashed', 'Alex', 'Hellonius', 'now', 'spurned', 'former', 'lover', 'Hellonius', 'be', 'one', 'Novak', 'favorite', 'composers', 'somewhat', 'outrageous', 'behavior', 'party', 'first', 'puzzles', 'Novak', 'Novak', 'finally', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'going', 'Christine', 'Hellonius', 'Christine', 'saying', 'was', 'merely', 'benefactor.A', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'Hellonius', 'Christine', 'emotionally', 'fragile', 'Novak', 'unwitting', 'pawn', 'Hellonius', 'taunts', 'Christine', 'guise', 'friendship', 'musical', 'sponsorship', 'Novak', 'Christine', 'Hellonius', 'good', 'worried', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'maintain', 'deception', 'then', 'solution', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'unnecessarily', 'final.Bette', 'Davis', 'excellent', 'role', 'Claude', 'Rains', 'out', 'stops', 'How', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'Academy', 'Award', 'performance', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'sensational', 'egotistical', 'clever', 'utterly', 'brilliant', 'composer', 'Paul', 'Henreid', 'fine', 'performance', 'war', 'scarred', 'sensitive', 'cellist', 'somewhat', 'overshadowed', 'co-stars', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'fans', 'classic', 'film', 'lovers', 'film', 'will', 'also', 'turn', 'viewer', 'die', 'hard', 'Claude', 'Rains', 'fan']",N/A

Memorable moments in the movies generally have nothing to do with real life, and an artificial pleasure contained in this one is watching LaDavis wolf down her smoked turkey as if nothing in the world has happened.  The vibrant intelligence of Davis could make endurable, if not save, a film as absurd as DECEPTION. This one is about good music, and at Warners, where good music was concerned - it was class all the way.  Davis shoots Claude Rains on the grandest of grand staircases in this film; since Bette's penthouse must be the biggest in New York, the emotions on display are of the same size.
