984934,ADVQF9EV3LPA0,B000F7CMSQ,Alexandra Bernstein,"[0, 11]","There are endearing characters, but some, like the waitresses, are one-joke characters and it's just not funny after a while.  In fact, the only characters who keep being funny are the cafe owner, the main commandant, and the gay lieutenant.  Everyone else has a very narrow range.  Some good jokes on the French and the English stereoptypes.  I just saw series I and II.  Maybe the later ones are better.  It never makes much sense that Rene harps on how stupid his wife it - she's a bad singer, and she acts blind to Rene's flirting with the waitresses, but she seems no less bright than everyone else.  And the old man spy is annoying.  Maybe the people who like this grew up on cliche-ridden WWII dramas, so they have more context than I do.",3,"Cute, but nowhere near as funny as lots of BBC comedies",1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,745,"['are', 'endearing', 'characters', 'waitresses', 'are', 'one-joke', 'characters', 'just', 'not', 'funny', 'while', 'fact', 'only', 'characters', 'who', 'keep', 'being', 'funny', 'are', 'cafe', 'owner', 'main', 'commandant', 'gay', 'lieutenant', 'Everyone', 'else', 'very', 'narrow', 'range', 'good', 'jokes', 'French', 'English', 'stereoptypes', 'just', 'saw', 'series', 'II', 'Maybe', 'later', 'ones', 'are', 'better', 'never', 'much', 'sense', 'Rene', 'harps', 'how', 'stupid', 'wife', 'bad', 'singer', 'blind', 'Rene', 'flirting', 'waitresses', 'less', 'bright', 'everyone', 'else', 'old', 'man', 'spy', 'annoying', 'Maybe', 'people', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'cliche-ridden', 'WWII', 'dramas', 'have', 'more', 'context', 'do']","'Allo 'Allo! - The Complete Series Five, Parts 1 and 2"

I must admit ALLO ALLO really utilized its serialized (or soap operatic, if you will) format the best during this season.
