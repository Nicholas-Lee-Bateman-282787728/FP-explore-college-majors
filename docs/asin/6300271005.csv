Plus, my acting coach (Van Brooks) has a role of the stadium police officer.There is a lot to like about this movie. Above all, the three main characters are 15 years old and are actually played by actors who are about that age. This movie captures the real feelings and emotions of the kids and deals with issues that kids this age often face. All three kids are very likable characters--it's easy to root for them.I was a teen at this time myself, and it captures all the feeling of being a teen in the 1980's. You'll laugh and cry. The kids learn lessons about love, forgiveness, understanding, prejudgments, and relationships.",5,watched it four times,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",2014,719,"['searched', 'movie', 'remember', 'friends', 'talking', 'when', 'was', 'teen', 'acting', 'coach', 'Van', 'Brooks', 'role', 'stadium', 'police', 'officer.There', 'lot', 'like', 'movie', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'are', '15', 'years', 'old', 'are', 'actually', 'played', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'age', 'movie', 'real', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'kids', 'deals', 'issues', 'kids', 'age', 'often', 'face', 'three', 'kids', 'are', 'very', 'likable', 'characters', 'easy', 'root', 'them.I', 'was', 'teen', 'time', 'feeling', 'being', 'teen', '1980', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'cry', 'kids', 'learn', 'lessons', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'understanding', 'prejudgments', 'relationships']",N/A

Leach ""L.Wildy""","[1, 2]","ok. ok. so after i read all your reviews i had to take a second look. when i first saw this movie i was too young to really understand why i liked it, so it stuck out in my head, and i didn't even know the name of it. all i knew was the actress Maddie corman, which i got her name from some other movie of hers that i actually remembered the name, which gave me her name, and i knew the plot of this movie. So i looked through all the descriptions of the movies she made in order to find this movie.Here, goes. After i bought it, i watched it and was bored.  Hated it. thought it was slow, and the events where boring.  Now after reading everyones review on this i had to watch it 2 years later, again, but this time with a different mind set.  I evaluated it as if i were still in the 80's and i was still a little kid, instead of trying to over analyze.  I actually liked it. lol The interesting part that made me think of this as something more than a boring teen movie, was the over all lesson. i guess it was meant to show how throughout all your problems growing up, and there will be problems, like love, friendship, and understanding eachother, these 3 friends made it through, put aside there problems and realized that there will be problems, but there will also be strong friendships that help you through them. Nice. so if you're looking for something mild, and decent, to bring back those youthful memories of growing up in the 80's, and you'd like to be taken back there for a moment, then this is pretty cool.",4,A SECOND LOOK,1163462400,"11 14, 2006",2006,1524,"['ok.', 'ok.', 'so', 'i', 'read', 'reviews', 'i', 'had', 'take', 'second', 'look', 'when', 'i', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'i', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'really', 'understand', 'why', 'i', 'liked', 'stuck', 'out', 'head', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'name', 'i', 'knew', 'was', 'actress', 'Maddie', 'corman', 'i', 'got', 'name', 'other', 'movie', 'hers', 'i', 'actually', 'remembered', 'name', 'gave', 'name', 'i', 'knew', 'plot', 'movie', 'i', 'looked', 'descriptions', 'movies', 'made', 'order', 'find', 'movie.Here', 'i', 'bought', 'i', 'watched', 'was', 'bored', 'Hated', 'thought', 'was', 'slow', 'events', 'where', 'boring', 'Now', 'reading', 'everyones', 'review', 'i', 'had', 'watch', '2', 'years', 'later', 'again', 'time', 'different', 'mind', 'set', 'evaluated', 'i', 'were', 'still', '80', 'i', 'was', 'still', 'little', 'kid', 'instead', 'trying', 'analyze', 'actually', 'liked', 'interesting', 'part', 'made', 'think', 'something', 'more', 'boring', 'teen', 'movie', 'was', 'lesson', 'i', 'guess', 'was', 'meant', 'show', 'how', 'problems', 'growing', 'up', 'will', 'be', 'problems', 'love', 'friendship', 'understanding', 'eachother', '3', 'friends', 'made', 'put', 'aside', 'there', 'problems', 'realized', 'will', 'be', 'problems', 'there', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'strong', 'friendships', 'help', 'Nice', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'mild', 'decent', 'bring', 'back', 'youthful', 'memories', 'growing', 'up', '80', ""'d"", 'like', 'be', 'taken', 'back', 'there', 'moment', 'then', 'pretty', 'cool']",N/A

O'Blenis,"[8, 8]","Proving that dramatic fare centering on teenage characters needn't be any less powerful than any other drama, the biggest strregth of ""Seven Minutes In Heaven"" (apart from the mere prescence of star Jennifer Connelly) is the realization that the loves, ambitions, anxieties, dreams, feelings and disappointments of teenagers are no less real and no less important than those of a person a few years older or a few years younger.  That's one of those things that so many people who previously would have agreed with fervently seem to forget on their twentieth birthday.  This movie is about all of those things - dreams, loves, anxieties, etc. - in the lives of three friends, Natalie (Connelly), Jeff (Byron Thames) and Polly (Maddie Corman).  I usually don't enjoy 'slice-of-life' dramas half as much as this one but ""Seven Minutes In Heaven"" is so good it would have been a keeper even without Jennifer Connelly in it, who's the reason I originally saw it.  Funny in places and downright heartbreaking in places, with massive charm, this movie is a credit to its kind.And yet it's not out on DVD - I guess I'll just have to add it to my list of dream DVD releases (""Dreamtrap"", ""Elves"", ""Basket Case 2"", ""Scamper The Penguin"", ""Twogether"", ""Mannequin II"", ""Cutting Class"" etc. - I could go on and on) that surely someday somebody will Have to bring out on DVD.Won't they?At least until then, the VHS of this gem can still be tracked down.
