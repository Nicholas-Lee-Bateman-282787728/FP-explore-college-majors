52321,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783225482,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","My best friend's wife told me about this movie a couple months ago, but it wasn't until the other night that I had a chance to sit down and watch it.  I don't know why it took so long for me to actually do since I absolutely adore all three of the films stars.  Bruce Willis was for the longest time my favorite actor (I grew up on his macho action films); and seriously, is there any actress as talented as Meryl Streep?  Goldie Hawn is a newbie to my list of great actresses, mostly because I never truly have her the time of day until recent years.  My wife is a huge fan and so I was forced to accept her and after some time I realized that I had come to really enjoy her and what she brought to each and every role.`Death Becomes Her' is, as many have noted, a black comedy.  It is dark and mysterious and utterly hilarious.  At times it is disturbing, at times it is sexy; at all times it is uproarious.  The film revolves around two rivals, the successful actress Madeline Ashton and her homely school friend Helen Sharp.  Before Helen ties the not with fianc&eacute;e Earnest Menville she brings him to one of Ashton's shows where he meets and falls for Madeline.  After Earnest leaves her for Ashton, Helen slips into depression only to discover a secret that gives her the extra boost she needs in order to exact her revenge against Madeline.  The only problem is that Madeline has discovered the same secret; a potion that guarantees them immortality, at a price.Bruce Willis may be better known for his action performances, but when you analyze them you realize that comedy is not beyond him.  His quick witted hero in `Die Hard' is known for those chuckle-worthy one-liners that helped cement him as an iconic character.  Here Bruce shines as Earnest, fully fleshing out his characters simple nature which adds to his endearing qualities.  A stark contrast to his co-stars, Willis plays down his looks and develops a character that is goofy and reserved and ultimately adorable.  Goldie Hawn is fantastic as the witching Helen Sharp.  Her beauty is on full display as she seethes and loathes her way into our hearts; seriously.This film BELONGS to Meryl Streep, though.  Her performance is insanely perfect; so much so that I actually felt bad for Goldie Hawn to have been upstaged so drastically.  Each and every one-liner just melted off her tongue as if it were liquid gold.  In talking to my wife afterwards I told her how you never really think of Meryl as a comedic actress because her dramatic turns have always garnered her more attention.  It really wasn't until her double-whammy in 2006 (with `The Devil Wears Prada' and `A Prarie Home Companion') that I took notice of her comedic timing.  This is a brilliant example of her range as an actress.  Honestly, I don't think there is any performance she can't pull off.  Like I've always said, Meryl is always solid; even when she isn't `amazing' she is still better than half of everything else out there.`Death Becomes Her' may not be ingenious.  It's plot is not intricate or necessarily `smart' or `mature' but the script is tightly written in order to keep the laughs bellowing from you mouth throughout the films entire running time; and those Oscar winning special effects (I don't think I'll ever get the image of Meryl's head sinking into her neck out of my head; and quite frankly I don't want to) only help to elevate the films comedic as well as dramatic worth.  Zemeckis knows how to get the best from his actors; even when his films are less than brilliant.  Here he marvelously draws pure comic gold from his cast, which includes a mystifying turn from Isabella Rossellini as Lisle con Rhoman, the witch responsible for this boatload of laughs.",5,A black comedy sure to brighten your day...,1213315200,"06 13, 2008",2008,3730,"['best', 'friend', 'wife', 'told', 'movie', 'couple', 'months', 'ago', 'was', ""n't"", 'other', 'night', 'had', 'chance', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'actually', 'do', 'absolutely', 'three', 'films', 'stars', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'was', 'longest', 'time', 'favorite', 'actor', 'grew', 'up', 'macho', 'action', 'films', 'seriously', 'there', 'actress', 'as', 'talented', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'newbie', 'list', 'great', 'actresses', 'mostly', 'never', 'truly', 'have', 'time', 'day', 'recent', 'years', 'wife', 'huge', 'fan', 'so', 'was', 'forced', 'accept', 'time', 'realized', 'had', 'come', 'really', 'enjoy', 'what', 'brought', 'role.', 'Death', 'Becomes', 'Her', 'many', 'have', 'noted', 'black', 'comedy', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'times', 'disturbing', 'times', 'sexy', 'times', 'uproarious', 'film', 'around', 'two', 'rivals', 'successful', 'actress', 'Madeline', 'Ashton', 'homely', 'school', 'friend', 'Helen', 'Sharp', 'Helen', 'not', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Earnest', 'Menville', 'one', 'Ashton', 'shows', 'where', 'Madeline', 'Earnest', 'Ashton', 'Helen', 'depression', 'only', 'discover', 'secret', 'extra', 'boost', 'order', 'exact', 'revenge', 'Madeline', 'only', 'problem', 'Madeline', 'discovered', 'same', 'secret', 'potion', 'immortality', 'price.Bruce', 'Willis', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'known', 'action', 'performances', 'when', 'analyze', 'realize', 'comedy', 'not', 'quick', 'witted', 'hero', 'Die', 'Hard', 'known', 'chuckle-worthy', 'one-liners', 'helped', 'cement', 'iconic', 'character', 'Here', 'Bruce', 'shines', 'Earnest', 'fully', 'fleshing', 'out', 'characters', 'simple', 'nature', 'endearing', 'qualities', 'stark', 'contrast', 'co-stars', 'Willis', 'down', 'looks', 'character', 'goofy', 'reserved', 'ultimately', 'adorable', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'fantastic', 'witching', 'Helen', 'Sharp', 'beauty', 'full', 'display', 'way', 'hearts', 'seriously.This', 'film', 'BELONGS', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'though', 'performance', 'insanely', 'perfect', 'so', 'much', 'actually', 'felt', 'bad', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'have', 'been', 'upstaged', 'so', 'drastically', 'one-liner', 'just', 'melted', 'off', 'tongue', 'were', 'liquid', 'gold', 'talking', 'wife', 'afterwards', 'told', 'how', 'never', 'really', 'think', 'Meryl', 'comedic', 'actress', 'dramatic', 'turns', 'have', 'always', 'garnered', 'more', 'attention', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'double-whammy', '2006', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'Prarie', 'Home', 'Companion', 'took', 'notice', 'comedic', 'timing', 'brilliant', 'example', 'range', 'actress', 'Honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', ""'ve"", 'always', 'said', 'Meryl', 'always', 'solid', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'amazing', 'still', 'better', 'half', 'everything', 'else', 'out', 'there.', 'Death', 'Becomes', 'Her', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'ingenious', 'plot', 'not', 'intricate', 'necessarily', 'smart', 'mature', 'script', 'tightly', 'written', 'order', 'keep', 'laughs', 'bellowing', 'mouth', 'films', 'entire', 'running', 'time', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'special', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'get', 'image', 'Meryl', 'head', 'sinking', 'neck', 'head', 'quite', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'only', 'help', 'elevate', 'films', 'comedic', 'as', 'well', 'dramatic', 'worth', 'Zemeckis', 'how', 'get', 'best', 'actors', 'even', 'when', 'films', 'are', 'less', 'brilliant', 'Here', 'marvelously', 'pure', 'comic', 'gold', 'cast', 'mystifying', 'turn', 'Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'Lisle', 'con', 'Rhoman', 'witch', 'responsible', 'boatload', 'laughs']",N/A

Two women, rivals Madeline and Helen, both have their eyes on the same man, plastic surgeon Ernest. When he leaves Helen for Madeline, Helen descends into a breakdown.

Obsessed with her failing youth, Madeline resorts to desperate measures to retain her youth - she drinks a magical potion that will keep her forever young. The trouble is, with eternal youth comes immortality, even when dead. To make matters worse, Helen drank the potion too, and poor Ernest finds himself in the middle of the mess.Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn are excellent as the bickering rivals, and Bruce Willis surprises as the long-suffering surgeon married to the wife from hell and her rival from Hades.

Meryl Streep plays an actress seeking to play young parts, but alas, she is getting older and her audiences are dwindling. As she goes to the beauty salon, she demands to know if there is anything that they can do  beyond what they have already done. The stylist finally hands her a card and tells her that it is to something very exclusive and secret. She doesn't believe it of course and goes about her life which is rapidly spiraling downward. her husband is drinking heavily, her boyfriend is seeking lovers his own age, but the straw that decides her course is the book party she has been invited to, and she sees her old friend slash rival, once an overweight loser, now a svelte young stunner, with emphasis on young. Naturally, she seeks to know just what her secret is, and discovers the card she was given leads to a huge sprawling mansion and a mysterious young woman with an elixir that grants eternal youth to any who drink it. This however, leads to a huge problem. She finds life is indeed eternal and when an accident on a staircase fails to kill her, even though she is officially dead. When she tries to kill her rival, who is seeking to run off with her husband, she discovers that she too is also in the same condition, and that eventually leads her to join forces in order to keep themselves together. When they try to give the potion to Meryl's husband, he refuses and finally makes his escape from them both when he learns why they wanted to keep him around. Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn are a tour de force together, but Bruce Willis has an unusual role as the weak willed plastic surgeon Dr. Menville, the milquetoast husband to Streep.

I know, she is the best actress of her generation and I always respected her talent but the movies she usually appear in, more in the dramatic and depressing range, are not necessarily what I want from ""the movies"". I admit it, I am always looking to be entertained first and foremost and here, Streep along with the whole cast succeeds brilliantly.I usually don't like to give a synopsis of any film I review because other reviewers often do it. And I truly believe that the element of surprise is something most people enjoy when they watch a movie. What I can say though is that this little gem has been grossly savaged by critics at the time of its release for no good reason whatsover even though it was a minor box-office hit.This is one thing that has always left me puzzled about ""official"" critics: the way to have of hating most movies that only want to entertain for the pure pleasure of it. I have absolutely no idea why they hated this wonderful production but I don't really care what they think. Audiences of that time loved the mix of fantasy and dark comedy with amazing performances by all the leads.Streep really knocked me for a loop in this movie. The delivery of her lines in full camp mode, the subtle gestures, the way she struts and moves her body... It makes her portrayal of the vain, conceited Madeline Ashton extremely real and immensely enjoyable. It is a shame she doesn't star in many comedies because her timing is impeccable. Goldie Hawn, Bruce Willis and Isabella Rossellini all make their characters very memorable as well.Robert Zemeckis did a great job in concocting a truly enjoyable story with just enough special effects (considered quite impressive back then and still adequate by today's standards) to keep it all together. There are many beautiful camera angle and elaborate sets adding to the satirical tone dictated by the subject matter which is a refusal to grow old gracefully.One thing though that irked me profoundly about this DVD though is the fact that the movie isn't available in widescreen format. Why is that? I mean, for me the whole point of watching a movie on DVD is the pleasure I get to view the film in its original theatrical format and a full screen version doesn't quite cut it. I really don't understand the choice to exclude the widescreen version which should be a prerequisite on any DVD.But I digress. If you want to get some laugh and be sucked into a wonderful dark world where backstabbing, bitchery and vanity all collide in a beautifully shot and intricate story, this movie is for you.

The film is perfectly cast. Bruce Willis is a miracle of anti-Bruce Willisness. Isabella Rossellini is over-the-top hilarious. Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn are given great lines, and perform them with brilliant excessiveness. The actor and actress who play the plastic surgeon and his assistant are outrageously funny, him with his roving eye, her with an exaggerated French accent. One reason I truly cherish this movie is that it is able to present uber-eccentric characters as believable. Few movies pull this off.Apart from the acting, terrific script, well-executed special effects,  rich visual colors (look, for example, at the scene where Helen Sharp [Hawn] stands outside Dr. Menville's door with an umbrella), another reason I cherish this movie is because every frame is interesting, and for many reasons. With some movies, you can name the truly interesting scenes. With this one, every scene is priceless! Still, my favorite moment in the film is where Helen Sharp explains how they will kill Madeline Ashton. It is done with narration, voice-overs, an eerie mix of normal and slow-motion effects, and the darkest of humor.

Director Robert Zemeckis pulls all the rabbits out of his hat to craft a visual experience the viewer will never forget--and all with a sharp, biting verve.Ah, immortality.  And beauty.  Ageless glamour and elegance.  Who wouldn't want such a gift, no matter what the price?  Two rivals, an aging movie star (Meryl Streep) and self-help guru (Goldie Hawn), willingly pay the ultimate price for eternal beauty in their never-ending tug-of-war over a shallow mortician (Bruce Willis, who is really fun to watch in this quirky role).  It's a struggle that crosses over to lethal force; trouble is, neither woman can be killed--but she can darn sure be disfigured.  Is that neck hopelessly broken?  Get out the mortician paint.It's impossible for Streep to turn in a mediocre performance, and she's at the top of her game here.  Hawn and Willis are outstanding, too, while Isabella Rossellini, who plays the witch who sells Streep and Hawn their ""magic potion"", is absolutely stunning.  Look for a cameo by the late great director Sydney Pollack as an ER physician about to receive the injury case of his career.

They come pretty close in ""Death Becomes Her,"" a delightfully wicked, twisted black comedy directed by Robert Zemeckis -- the dialogue is wonderfully barbed, the comedy is warped, and the quartet of lead actors give the performances of a lifetime.Years ago, starlet Madeline Ashton (Meryl Streep) stole plastic surgeon Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis) from her longtime rival, dowdy writer Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn). Consumed by hatred for Madeleine, Helen becomes an obese recluse and is eventually locked up in a mental institution.Present day (and by that, I mean the 1980s): Madeline and Ernest (now a harpyish has-been and  an alcoholic undertaker) appear at the signing for Helen's bestselling book -- and are shocked to see that she's now a stunning youthful bombshell. This drives Madeline to seek out the services of Lisle von Rhoman (Isabella Rossellini), a sensual sorceress who sells her a potion that restores her youth. A small warning: ""Take care of your body."" Easier said than done.Meanwhile, Helen and Ernest have been plotting to kill her, and a fight leads to Madeleine falling down the stairs and twisting her head 180 degrees. She's not dead... but not really alive either. And the problem is, Helen has had the same treatment -- meaning that when Madeleine gets her revenge, her rival doesn't die either. Is there a way out of this mess, or are the ladies doomed to eternal unlife?If you like moral messages with your warped comedy, here's ""Death Becomes Her's"":  a short life lived to the fullest is way better than an empty endless one, and shallow people who try to stay eternally young are pathetic. Nobody can argue with that, but that's not the reason people watch this movie. They watch it for the wickedly warped wit and the hilarious trio of actors.Zemeckis does an absolutely brilliant job with the sort of gothic-screwball plot, which is the perfect mix of ghoulish humor and slapstick. The dialogue is full of witty barbs (""You're a fraud, Helen! You're a walking lie and I can see right through you!""), and hilarious dialogue (""They took her to the morgue."" ""The morgue? She'll be FURIOUS!""). And some of the scenes here will make you howl your head off, such as the grand finale -- why can't more movies end this brilliantly?Additionally, Zemeckis brought out the best in all three lead actors. I don't really like Hawn's acting, and tend to consider Willis' mixed -- but Streep and Hawn are deliciously catty, shallow and a little crazed, playing a pair of thoroughly repulsive women. Willis plays Ernest as a depressed mortician who gets increasingly frantic as the story goes on, and Isabella Rossellini is brilliant as the beauty-obsessed sorceress.""Death Becomes Her"" is the sort of movie I wish they would make more often -- a wild, hilarious dark comedy with a twisted streak a mile wide.

He plays a very nerdy plastic surgeon who has relationships with both Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn's characters. Both women end up taking a potion that gives them eternal life and youth/beauty, but when they each take the potion, they do not consider the long-term or negative effects of it. They carry on a virtual war with one another and end up literally falling apart. The first time I saw this film I was a bit stunned by it and not at all entertained, but after I saw it again I realized it was a good concept with a highly talented cast and indeed a highly talented special effects crew. The effects alone are worth watching. Also, as I said, Willis is surprising in this role... and very entertaining as the tortured man between these two bitter enemies (Hawn and Streep). In the end these women end up having to befriend one another, begrudgingly, because they share this miserable eternal life.

But let us say there is a potion, an elixir, &quot;a touch of magic in a world obsessed with science.&quot;  Drink it and you will be forever young.  Do not drink it and watch yourself rot away with old age.  Just such a potion falls into the hands of two women who are not only consumed with vanity but fierce rivals, determined to best each other no matter the cost.  Siempre Viva: Live Forever!  Whether you like it or not!With excellent performances, an invective-laced script, and remarkable special effects, DEATH BECOMES HER takes on several great philosophical and literary concepts--and subverts them into one of the most wickedly funny black comedies in recent memory, dishy, bitchy, mean spirited, and a tremendous amount of fun.  Film buffs will particularly relish this film, which references everything from THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW to THE WIZARD OF OZ and a host of classic horror films such as FRANKENSTEIN, THE MUMMY, and CAT PEOPLE--and also tacks in everything from Tennessee Williams plays to rock legend Jim Morrison for good measure.Unfortunately, the DVD release is commonplace, offering the film in pan-and-scan only.  To give the release its due, the shift from widescreen to pan-and-scan is expertly done and not in the least distracting--but still, a widescreen option for such a special effects heavy film would be preferred.  And while this would seem to be an ideal film for a making-of documentary, the DVD offers only a handful of production notes as bonus.  Even so, the film is so extremely well done that I wouldn't miss it on that account!

Bruce Willis comes out of his action movie front to play a hilarious nerdy plastic surgeon. But it's Meryl Streep and especially Goldie Hawn who steal show. The best lines in the whole film are Goldie: &quot;There's A Hole In My Stomach!!!!!&quot; Bruce: &quot;It's another miracle!&quot; Another great line is Meryl: &quot;Forever Young. Ha! And eternally fat.&quot; Death Becomes Her has a little something for everybody.Helen (Goldie Hawn) has just lost her fiance Ernest (Bruce Willis) to Broadway bimbo Madeline Ashton (Meryl Streep). 7 years later, Helen is fat, and has been evicted from her apartment. Another 7 years later, Madeline &amp; Ernest have been invited to Helen's booksigning party. Helen is MUCH thinner, and Madeline gets suspicious. She goes to see a woman (Isabella Rosellini) who gives Madeline a potion that guarentees eternal youth &amp; beauty. But, Madeline winds up dead, and has a very head turning experience. Helen &amp; Ernest meanwhile have been plotting a way to kill Madeline. When Helen comes by to make sure that Ernest has buried Madeline, she winds up getting shot in the stomach by Madeline. Now both dead, they must get Ernest to drink the potion, so he can keep on repairing their dead bodies.

And besides, the entire cast works together especially well, especially Goldie Hawn (Helen Sharp) and Meryl Streep (the one and only, Madeline Ashton.)""Death Becomes Her"" is the story of two incredibly vain, megalomaniacs who each find a perpetual fountain of youth. Courtesy of Lisle von Rhoman (played by the talented and equally beautiful Isabella Rossellini.)The movie begins with Helen and Dr. Ernest Menville (a very funny Bruce Willis) watching a sublime (and substandard) Broadway performance of an old chum of Helen's; Madeline. (Incidentally, Broadway Shows have nothing to do with the quality of the performance, rather it is a description to describe the number of seats in the theater.) It is soon apparent that Dr. Menville is smitten with Madeline, but he denies it to Helen (his fiance.)After Dr. Menville marries Madeline (no one saw that coming!,) Helen really goes berserk! She eats herself into an oblivion (Helen especially enjoys those Betty Crocker frosting containers) and has to be carted off to the loony bin kicking and screaming. Goldie was absolutely astounding during these scenes in the movie. Because she totally turned into another person. Not only did she look like a big fat crazy lunatic, but she acted exactly the way anyone would expect!Fast forward 7 years. Helen has written a book and invites Madeline and Ernest to the release party. Of course Madeline wants to go so she can rub her friend's nose in the fact that she stole her lover. But when Madeline sees how beautiful and young Helen looks she nearly faints! Yup, Goldie changed her look again. This time she was svelte and stunning to look at. Things get even more complicated for Madeline when her young boy-toy takes up with a younger woman!So, on a whim, Madeline visits Lisle (pronounced like ""Lisa"") and purchases her fountain of youth. Wasn't it hysterical when Lisle asked Madeline to tell her how old she thought she looked and Madeline said 38! Did you noticed that shocked look on Lisle's face? And, while this is all going on, Helen and Ernest are plotting to kill Madeline and make it all look like an accident. When Madeline comes home and shoots her mouth off one too many times to Ernest he gets enraged and pushes her down the stairs. It was hysterical when Helen said to Ernest, ""what part of the plan did you not understand?""The rest of the movie is a competition between Helen and Madeline to lure Ernest back to each of them. Then when they each realize that he isn't anything special, they decide to get him to drink the same potion as they did. So he can live forever and maintain their upkeep (after all, he's an undertaker!)It was also so incredibly funny how Madeline and Ernest all of a sudden became a loving couple after he tried to kill her. If that's not complete and utter dysfunction, then I don't know what is! And, of course it was just as funny how Helen and Madeline were both fighting over Ernest because they only desired him because the other wanted him! And, it was even more hysterical how Madeline and Helen would say these incredibly mean-spirited comments to each other then act like the best of friends! These two kooks really fed off he each other so well. Like Baby Jane and Blanche Hudson, Helen and Madeline are destined to be together for the rest of their lives!If you enjoyed this movie, I also recommend:She-DevilandOverboard.This movie will put a smile on anyone's face!

Helen (Goldie Hawn) is engaged to be married to Dr Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis), a famous plastic surgeon.  They watch a rather awful show at the theatre and go backstage to meet the star, Madeline Ashton (Meryl Streep).  Madeline and Helen knew each other in high school, and Helen believes that Madeline intentionally steals every boyfriend Helen has.  This is the final test before the wedding.  Naturally, Madeline, who is vain about her appearance and worried about aging, does steel Ernest away and ends up marrying him herself.  This drives Helen crazy, literally.  We flash forward seven years to get an update on the characters, then another seven years to bring us to the main section of our story.  Madeline is aging and she hates it.  She meets up with Helen again, and Helen looks fantastic, as if she hasn't aged a day in the past 14 years.  Helen is all glammed up and looks like a star.  Madeline is starting to look frumpy.  It is all starting to come full circle and Madeline's jealousy is driving her to do something rash.Rather than do something predictable (in the movies, anyway) like start killing people, Madeline goes to a strange woman named Lisle (Isabella Rossellini) and gets a potion that halts the aging process and returns the body to its youthful, more perfect image.  It also bestows immortality.  Now Madeline can compete with Helen again!  This rivalry and this fight will continue on through life and even into death.""Death Becomes Her"" is a comedy.  It is a very strange comedy, and has something of a dark humor, but it is without question an original movie.  It is one of the more overlooked movies in Robert Zemeckis's filmography.  He is better known for ""Back to the Future"", ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Cast Away"".  This isn't a perfect movie, but it is entertaining, creative, and interesting.  One important thing that I can say is that I did not find this movie predictable at all.

The imaginative plot is enhanced by the terrific special effects, and the cast plays it to the hilt.  Ms. Streep, fittingly, has been applauded by just about everyone on the planet and her work here justifies that. Sure, she can break your heart in ""Sophie's Choice"" and countless other films, but the woman is funny, too. Really funny. And well-matched with Goldie Hawn, whose own comedy chops are justly famous---they create a seamless, hysterical  love-hate relationship. They're both beautiful (at least, part of the time) and it's easy to see why they want to hold onto their looks. Bruce Willis fans will hardly recognize him in his his role as the spineless Ernest.

The film centers on the eternal  quest for beauty and youth by an aging Hollywood starlet, Madeline Ashton,  (played by the brillant Meryl Streep). Her high school rival, Helen,  (Goldie Hawn), brings her latest beau to meet Ashton after a campy  performance in a musical based on &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; (get the  theme already?).When Madeline runs off with Helen's fiance (Bruce  Willis) Helen falls into a demented state and becomes obese and determined  to get even with Madeline. After discovering a secret potion sold by a  Hollywood witch (Isabella Rosellini) both Helen, and later Madeline regain  their youth, vitality, and beauty. However, all this comes with strings  involving immortality.The wonderful script pokes fun at many  stereotypes, rumors, and realities Hollywood is well-known for. From  plastic surgery to the fact that no one has never met a neighbor in Los  Angeles, the script is intelligent scriptwriting at its' best. The special  effects by Industrial Light and Magic which has Helen walking with a hole  through her midsection, and Madeline walking with a twisted neck are  incredible to watch. One thing I adored about this film was the wicked,  dark, and diabolical score by Alan Silvestri that incorporates harps and  vengeful theme throughout the film.The film's ending featuring a legion  of Hollywood's undead (including Marilyn Monroe, Elvis, and James Dean)is  hysterical and even the names of the two main characters, Madeline  (&quot;Mad&quot; as in crazy) and Helen (&quot;Hell&quot; as in hellish) is  genius.

Two aging women, played by gorgeous but aging actresses, make fun of plastic surgery and black magic to the extreme to keep from aging and dying. The problem is, the body still takes all the damage, but it just won't die. Luis and Priscilla (other Amazon reviewers) have given you a great synopsis of the show itself, so I won't get into the plot line.What I will say is that if you think about this from the Hollywood perspective of aging actresses who aren't aging gracefully vs. those who are, there is even MORE humor to be found in this movie with a bit of political commentary about the aging of gorgeous women in the public eye. I loved that aspect of it.Meryl Streep does great straight-man comedy in this and Goldie Hawn is no stranger to comedy, and this role fits her well, especially if you keep up with anything in her real life outside of the movies.Now, before you go and buy or rent this movie to watch, you should know that it's a 'stoopid' movie.

52441,A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q,0783225482,Priscilla Stafford,"[9, 10]","Meryl Streep plays Madeline Ashton, an actress who is obsessed with keeping herself looking young and beautiful. Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn), is a plain looking author with a brilliant surgeon, Dr. Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis), for a fiance. Madeline and Helen have hated each other for years, but things become even worse when Madeline steals Ernest from Helen and they get married. Years later, Madeline is even more obsessed with keeping her youth, willing to do ANYTHING to keep from aging physically. On the other hand, Helen is obsessed to get revenge on Madeline for stealing her fiance. But it seems that there is one thing in common between the two rivals, in that both seem to know the same woman, Lisle Von Rhoman (Isabella Rossellini). Lisle, who has the power to give the two woman something the world has been searching for centuries... the secret of youth. But Madeline and Helen will learn that the 'secret of youth' has a high price, and that their 'lives' will never be the same again.As the title of my review says, &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; is a very dark yet hilariously funny movie. Directed by genius Robert Zemeckis (director of the Back to the Future trilogy, &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, &quot;Contact&quot;, and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;), he gives the movie such an underlying sense of psychological suspense that it's really hard what category to put this movie under.Is it a comedy?: Yes, &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; could be called a comedy. But it has a very twisted sort of humor, you'll have to be someone who enjoys all forms of comedy to really enjoy and understand the humor. There is both laugh-out-loud slapstick humor, then there's the dry type of humor which takes a few seconds to really getting you chuckling. But more than anything, the satire and irony of the story is so well imbedded into the plot that there's really no specific part you can pinpoint as the funniest part of the movie. When the movie finished, my parents and I stopped the movie, there was a brief pause, THEN we started howling with laughter! It's the truth, really! No, it wasn't because it was so awful or stupid (some parts were) but because it's not until AFTER the movie that the satire of the film really hits you.Is it horror?: Yes, there are some parts which you could describe the movie as being under the horror genre. There's the whole 'haunted, creepy, gothic mansion' scene, and one of the themes of the movie is about 'death'.Is it a drama?: Strangely enough, there is a sense of drama in the story. The story touches upon the topics of death and the dream of wanting to 'live forever and retain your youth'. This is very well expressed through the main actresses and actor of the movie. I mean, what will your choice been when given a chance to be able to live forever? The suspense towards the end when one of the characters must decide is well executed.But more than anything, it's not just the story of the movie that really gets you, it's the fact that the actors do such an outstanding job with their characters. Meryl Streep is simply fantastic and she handles the dark side of her character very well. Goldie Hawn is also fantastic, can you imagine her as a fat, depressed, and ugly woman? Well, watch this movie to see her handle the role with ease. And Bruce Willis, you would never imagine seeing him in this kind of movie, but he is just GREAT! He plays the character plagued by two very 'obsessed' woman very well, and he's 'kind of' the 'hero' of the film.As others have also mentioned, the effects of the movie are brilliantly put to the screen.

The visual effects is what most attracts people to this film as it did back in 1992. The story is essentially dark comedy and satire, about the human weakness in women about vanity and rivalry, although commenting on men and women's desire to live forever, cheat death and remain young. Zemeckis lavished the film with stunning visual effects, haunting imagery and chilling music. Great performances by the lead actors. This film is worthy of Oscars, but I don't recall whether it won anything back in 1992.Bruce Willis is the husband of Goldie Hawn, (Helen), Meryl Streep plays her rival, a faded stage actress. When the two women fight for him and to keep themselves young, they seek an enchantress (played by Isabella Rosallini) who gives them a potion that makes them young. However, they begin to rot and deteriorate until they are cartoon-like parodies of themselves, with plastic contortions of their bodies, huge eyes and holes in their stomachs. They die and even then they are caught up on lookin good. A great commentary on the plastic surgery and breast/image enhancement women of Hollywood are so pressured to do these days.

As people leave the theater in droves, Earnest Melville watches with wide open eyes at her sensational performance, as his fiance, Helen Sharp, watches with nervous eyes.  Melville and Sharp go to see Ashton after the show, and Ashton is out to impress.  Helen watches helplessly as Ashton overtly flirts wtih her man.  After the show, Sharp explains to Melville that Ashton has stolen men from her before, and that she just wanted to see if he could pass the ""Madeline Ashton test"".  He fails, soon marrying her and driving Helen into a life of misery and obesity in a small apartment full of cats.  As Helen tries to forget all about her past, Madeline drives her new husband, once a brilliant plastic surgeon, down to the pont where he is a despairing, depressed mortician.  When Ashton is insulted by her partner in an affair for being so much older than he is, she becomes horribly depressed, and desperate for some solution to the problem of old age.  She drives to the home of Lisle Van Rhuman, a temptress who is slmost symbolic of satan, who promises her eternal youth in a bottle.  From here, things begin going down hill, as Ashton, now undead, and Sharp fight over the man they no longer love.Isabella Rosalini plays Lisle brilliantly, strangely enough giving me the creeps more than just about any other villain.  Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn play the competing zombies perfectly, and Bruce Willis plays his part brilliantly.

It has witty dialogue, eye-popping special effects and computer graphics and a superb cast - Meryl Streep, Bruce Willis, Goldie Hahn and Isabella Rosselini. On DVD, it looks better than ever. It contains the Spanish-dubbed version of the film as well as the French-dubbed edition. It also features a featurette on the making of the movie and discussions among the lead actors.obert Zemecki's 1992 dark comedy, Death Becomes Her, is a satirical surreal story that uses computer graphics, special effects and a superb script to tell the story of a mortician Earnest (Bruce Willis)who is caught in the middle of a bitter feud between two vain, catty women who have always stolen each other's boyfriend and contested their beauty. When Madelyn(Streep) discovers the secret to eternal youth - an expensive potion owned by a witch - Isabella Rossalini- she gets more than she bargained for when she is killed and now is an undead woman. As luck would have it, her rival Helen also took the potion and is also killed. The two must now set aside their enmity and rely on the mortiican to constantly beautify them. The movie is a classic but not very fondly remembered for some reason. I have always enjoyed it and have watched it several times on cable. I think this is Bruce Willi's greatest foray into comedy as is Goldie Hahns and Meryl Streep. A must have for fans of the leading actors who find themselves in a sticky situation. The story, funny and outrageous though it may be, is a satirical take on America's fatal obscession with beauty and undying youth. Women today get boob jobs, botox, and age-reducing products to maintain a semblance of youth. We all want to cheat death in our own way but it amounts to nothing because, naturally, you lose your soul and lose track of the more important things- just living a full happy life, like Ernest was able to do. He remarried and had kids. His life was complete while Helen and Madelyn must spend the rest of eternity with each other and making sure their bodies don't deteriorate.

In other words, almost none of the original theatrical image has been removed for exhibition on a 4:3 television screen.  The film negative aspect ratio was 1.37:1 (almost 4:3), and for theatrical exhibition, the image was ""matted"" (partially covered from the top down and bottom up) to produce a 1.85:1 image.

The movie was likely filmed this way so that the theatrical image wouldn't be butchered on television by the ""Pan&Scan"" process, and because the filmmakers didn't foresee the current state of the home video market, where consumers prefer movies presented in their theatrical aspect ratio, rather than in a ratio in which the image will fill up their 4:3 television screen (if there is a difference).  This DVD presents the movie in the aspect ratio in which the filmmakers wanted people to see it on a 4:3 television, but it does not present the movie in the aspect ratio in which the filmmakers wanted people to see it in a movie theater (for that, the DVD would have to present the movie in a ""matted widescreen"" format).

I remember going into the cinema in the local mall (which was torn down LONG ago) and seeing carboard cutouts of Hawn, Willis, and Streep.  Of course, I had no idea who they were, but the image of Willis's hand going through Hawn's stomach is tough to forget.I also remember seeing a TV special on the making of this movie, because at that time the special effects used were ultra-high-tech.Of course I didn't see the movie in the theater.  I was awful young.  A few years after its theatrical run (maybe two) somebody in my family saw this movie on sale at Randall's as a used video and bought it at a discount.I enjoyed the movie, particularly because at that point I'd seen nothing where the major theme centered around a fountain of youth.  It's a fascinating concept when done well, as done here.The plot's unusual: Two bitter woman rivals obsessed with vanity drink a magical potion that keeps them young forever, so no matter what awful things they do to one another, they remain alive, even after they're classified as clinically dead.  Unfortunately, their bodies take quite a beating and need the upkeep of a plastic surgeon.  So they try to get Dr. Ernest Menville (Willis) to drink the potion too.  There's a lot more to the story, actually, since Dr. Menville has had very intimate relationships with both women in the past.  The build-up of this story is quite beautiful, although a bit sketchy when addressing Hawn's party at the beginning.I'll close by saying that there are a few scenes of nude female behinds every now and then.

52460,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,0783225482,the masked reviewer,"[0, 0]","Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn battle Mother Nature, the witch who invented maturity, in ""Death Becomes Her."" This inventive black comedy ridicules two gorgeous fortysomethings in search of the ultimate wrinkle cream. More cosmetic than cosmic in its approach, it thrives on what it condemns and in its own weird, wonderfully savvy fashion, spanks the liposucked fannies of Hollywood. It's as irresistibly nasty as ""The War of the Roses"" and as cheerily Gothic as ""The Witches of Eastwick"".A tale in four chapters, it begins with Streep's parody of an Ann-Margret-inspired production number that asks the musical question, ""When I look in the mirror, who do I see?"" and answers, ""I see me."" Towed about the stage by a chorus of boy dancers, Streep is amazingly good at being bad. How gleefully she heads down Sunset Boulevard in the role of Madeline Ashton, an imperious star whose popularity is falling along with her face instead of growing with her waistline. That night the bookish Helen Sharp (Hawn) brings her fiance (Bruce Willis) backstage to meet her old friend, which is pretty foolish when you consider that Madeline has a history of man-grabbing. And since Helen's fiance is a mild-mannered plastic surgeon named Ernest Menville, we assume he represents not just one man but all who bear the XY chromosome. Well, before you can say, ""Don't forget to moisturize,"" Ernest and Madeline are wed.Helen, who gains 200 pounds on a diet of cake frosting and enters a mental hospital, returns 12 or so years later to find the brilliant doctor an alcoholic reduced to making up corpses. Motivated by her hatred for Madeline, she has transformed herself into a va-va-voomish beauty-book author who is determined to win back Ernest. Her taut little tush and her chipper little chin leave Madeline in a jealous rage. Madeline would do anything, she'd pay anything to get rid of those darned liver spots. And who should step in but Lancome spokesmodel Isabella Rossellini, ironically cast as a mysterious goddess endowed with a potion from hell. Drink it and you are forever young -- and beautiful, provided you take infinitely good care of your body. Unfortunately, Madeline takes a nasty spill down a flight of stairs and comes up looking like Linda Blair, with her lovely head on backward. When Helen gloats, Madeline retaliates by blowing a hole through her the size of a trash-can lid, after which the two women are condemned to an eternal cat fight. Fed up with the feud, the doctor goes into a new-age phase.Director Robert Zemeckis, who took us ""Back to the Future"" (thrice), directs this technically complicated, stylishly imaginative extravaganza with the sure hand of Dr. Menville before he got into Scotch. It's rich in terms of offbeat lines and unexpected laughs, as might be expected from the authors of the kinky thriller ""Apartment Zero."" It is also refreshingly old-fashioned, reminiscent less of 'Roger Rabbit' and 'Back to the Future' than of '40s screwball and horror spoofs. Overall, this is an excellent black comedy that boasts the talents of three A-list actors at the top of their game. The film maintains both a dry wit and a dark edge throughout, and its wonderful comic book feel gives it an originality, and a refreshing longevity, as Zemeckis (again) takes his audience into a superbly crafted fantasy world.Enormous fun!",5,IRRESISTIBLY NASTY!
