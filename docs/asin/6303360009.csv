370511,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6303360009,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","Ginger Rogers won a Best Actress Oscar for RKO's KITTY FOYLE, an at-times weepy melodrama that was also nominated for Director (Sam Wood), Picture, Sound and Screenplay (Dalton Trumbo). Trumbo's left-leaning politics may have influenced this adaptation of Christopher Morley's novel not so much in its theme of class superiority/inferiority but with a gratuitous, fleeting insult aimed at bankers.SYNOPSIS--Kitty (Rogers) is a working class girl with two suitors: one a Philadelphia blueblood, the other a struggling young physician. Her story is an emotional roller coaster that hits every soap opera button-- romance, marriage, divorce, pregnancy, a stillbirth, and finally a decision to be made: become mistress to a man with a wife and child when he moves alone to Brazil, or accept the marriage proposal of the second, whom Kitty cares for but not with the intense love that she feels for the first.Ginger Rogers handles a challenging role well. Her performance here is to this reviewer's mind not Oscar-worthy.

370512,A3BIWTN2DA0YY2,6303360009,Antoinette Klein,"[5, 5]","Ginger Rogers stepped off the dance floor and into dramatic movies in the 1940's.  This classic love story, subtitled ""The Natural History of a Woman,"" is a great introduction to her work for those not familiar with it.She plays the part of Kitty Foyle, a working class girl with lots of moxie and a desire to have all the finer things in life that only a rich husband could provide.  The movie begins at the end when she has until midnight to choose between two lovers:  her former boss, the handsome and wealthy Wynn Strafford (Dennis Morgan) of Philadelphia's Main Line Society who can offer her an unmarried arrangement or the poor yet dedicated doctor (James Craig) who has courted her and wants to marry her.  The story unfolds in flashbacks as Kitty gazes into a snow globe and remembers all the heartache and complex situations that have brought her to this night.Notable for its depiction of a working class girl and her shattered dreams, this earned Ginger Rogers the Academy Award for Best Actress.  Included in the special features on the DVD are two appropriate cartoons:  a Tom and Jerry episode entitled ""Kitty Foiled"" and a classic spoof of the movie entitled ""Bad Luck Blackie.""",5,Ginger Rogers' Oscar Winning Performance Will Resonate With All Working Girls,1196035200,"11 26, 2007",2007,1195,"['Ginger', 'Rogers', 'stepped', 'off', 'dance', 'floor', 'dramatic', 'movies', '1940', 'classic', 'love', 'story', 'subtitled', 'Natural', 'History', 'Woman', 'great', 'introduction', 'work', 'not', 'familiar', 'it.She', 'part', 'Kitty', 'Foyle', 'working', 'class', 'girl', 'lots', 'moxie', 'desire', 'have', 'finer', 'things', 'life', 'only', 'rich', 'husband', 'could', 'provide', 'movie', 'end', 'when', 'midnight', 'choose', 'two', 'lovers', 'former', 'boss', 'handsome', 'wealthy', 'Wynn', 'Strafford', 'Dennis', 'Morgan', 'Philadelphia', 'Main', 'Line', 'Society', 'who', 'can', 'offer', 'unmarried', 'arrangement', 'poor', 'yet', 'dedicated', 'doctor', 'James', 'Craig', 'who', 'courted', 'marry', 'story', 'unfolds', 'flashbacks', 'Kitty', 'snow', 'globe', 'remembers', 'heartache', 'complex', 'situations', 'have', 'brought', 'night.Notable', 'depiction', 'working', 'class', 'girl', 'shattered', 'dreams', 'earned', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Included', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'two', 'appropriate', 'cartoons', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'episode', 'entitled', 'Kitty', 'Foiled', 'classic', 'spoof', 'movie', 'entitled', 'Bad', 'Luck', 'Blackie']",Kitty Foyle VHS
370513,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6303360009,Bobby Underwood,"[45, 46]","Ginger Rogers was very popular, both within the Hollywood community, and with the moviegoing public. With two strong performances in 1940, she took home the Oscar despite strong competition. Rogers perfectly captured the dilema of every American girl who worked for a living. Her portrayel of a young woman having to decide between a young woman's daydream of what love would be like and the real thing is flawless. Sam Wood directed this very entertaining film based on Christopher Morley's popular book.Ginger is Kitty Foyle, a career girl from Philadelphia who falls for her boss, Wyn Strafford (Dennis Morgan), in what she thinks is everything she's dreamed about all her life. Wood used a snowglobe as a transitional device to Kitty's flashbacks of their romance, just as George Stevens had used a phonograph in Penny Serenade the previous year. Kitty and Wyn are no longer together, their brief marriage ending in divorce when it finally becomes clear to Kitty that her Irish American moxie can not overcome Wyn's old-money family in their Darby Mill--Griscom Street romance.Kitty has moved on and has a chance for something real with a young but poor doctor portrayed by James Craig. But it is a down to earth and more practical love, and when Wyn suddenly appears to take her away once more, but not as his wife, she must decide which path to choose. As she packs to run away with Wyn, she argues with her conscience and remembers.Ernest Cossart is very good as Kitty's pop, trying to steer her in the right direction. He may have been born four drinks below par, as Kitty affectionately teases him, but he is wise enough to see Wyn's weak character, which will never allow him to break from his society family and make a real life with his daughter. Kitty will face two tragedies simultaneously in this warm and sentimental story of an American working girl trying to have it all.Rogers did deserve the Oscar because she is everything in this film. She may have been the only actress around who could have so readily been accepted to represent an entire generation of young women during the 1940's. They viewed her as one of their own, even though the glamour of Hollywood was part of her story as well. She was the American girl made good, and her performance here is flawless.A fine ending showed not only Kitty's Irish American moxie, but her growth and maturity as well. This is a fine film with a terrific performance from Ginger Rogers that is very much a product of the era it was made. A fine score from Roy Webb adds to this gentle story of letting the dream of love go in favor of the real thing. A must own for Ginger's fans and a good one for film buffs to add to their collection.",5,Ginger Rogers Shines,1131494400,"11 9, 2005",2005,2702,"['Ginger', 'Rogers', 'was', 'very', 'popular', 'Hollywood', 'community', 'moviegoing', 'public', 'two', 'strong', 'performances', '1940', 'took', 'home', 'Oscar', 'strong', 'competition', 'Rogers', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'dilema', 'American', 'girl', 'who', 'worked', 'living', 'portrayel', 'young', 'woman', 'having', 'decide', 'young', 'woman', 'daydream', 'what', 'love', 'would', 'be', 'real', 'thing', 'flawless', 'Sam', 'Wood', 'directed', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'based', 'Christopher', 'Morley', 'popular', 'book.Ginger', 'Kitty', 'Foyle', 'career', 'girl', 'Philadelphia', 'who', 'boss', 'Wyn', 'Strafford', 'Dennis', 'Morgan', 'what', 'everything', 'dreamed', 'life', 'Wood', 'used', 'snowglobe', 'transitional', 'device', 'Kitty', 'flashbacks', 'romance', 'just', 'George', 'Stevens', 'had', 'used', 'phonograph', 'Penny', 'Serenade', 'previous', 'year', 'Kitty', 'Wyn', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'together', 'brief', 'marriage', 'ending', 'divorce', 'when', 'finally', 'clear', 'Kitty', 'Irish', 'American', 'moxie', 'can', 'not', 'overcome', 'Wyn', 'old-money', 'family', 'Darby', 'Mill', 'Griscom', 'Street', 'romance.Kitty', 'moved', 'chance', 'something', 'real', 'young', 'poor', 'doctor', 'portrayed', 'James', 'Craig', 'down', 'earth', 'more', 'practical', 'love', 'when', 'Wyn', 'suddenly', 'take', 'away', 'once', 'more', 'not', 'wife', 'must', 'decide', 'path', 'choose', 'run', 'away', 'Wyn', 'conscience', 'remembers.Ernest', 'Cossart', 'very', 'good', 'Kitty', 'pop', 'trying', 'steer', 'right', 'direction', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'born', 'four', 'drinks', 'par', 'Kitty', 'affectionately', 'wise', 'enough', 'see', 'Wyn', 'weak', 'character', 'will', 'never', 'allow', 'break', 'society', 'family', 'make', 'real', 'life', 'daughter', 'Kitty', 'will', 'face', 'two', 'tragedies', 'simultaneously', 'warm', 'sentimental', 'story', 'American', 'working', 'girl', 'trying', 'have', 'all.Rogers', 'did', 'deserve', 'Oscar', 'everything', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'actress', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'so', 'readily', 'been', 'accepted', 'represent', 'entire', 'generation', 'young', 'women', '1940', 'viewed', 'one', 'own', 'even', 'glamour', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'part', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'American', 'girl', 'made', 'good', 'performance', 'here', 'flawless.A', 'fine', 'ending', 'showed', 'not', 'only', 'Kitty', 'Irish', 'American', 'moxie', 'growth', 'maturity', 'as', 'well', 'fine', 'film', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'very', 'much', 'product', 'era', 'was', 'made', 'fine', 'score', 'Roy', 'Webb', 'gentle', 'story', 'letting', 'dream', 'love', 'go', 'favor', 'real', 'thing', 'must', 'own', 'Ginger', 'fans', 'good', 'one', 'film', 'buffs', 'add', 'collection']",Kitty Foyle VHS
370514,AZAR0EO6NGV7,6303360009,"Brent Carleton ""Brent Carleton""","[3, 6]","One puzzles over the celebrity attached to this film. What has it, after all, to offer? Whatever the novel's merits, the screen play is a tired collection of pulpy womens' magazine clich&eacute;s, already quite played out by 1940.For Ginger Rogers, her lead as ""Kitty"" is anything but new turf, (and hardly Oscar worthy) and is in fact, both in dialog and situations a retread of many of her thirties roles. In listening to Kitty, one hears echos of Rogers in the 30s in all those working class melodramas--as hat check girl, manicurist, chorine, carnival vendor etc, --the girl whose hard boiled bon mots conceal an inner decency.Then there are the other hackneyed ingredients. We have, for example, a tired romantic triangle in which the star has her choice of two stalwart, handsome leading men, Gladys Cooper in the mink collar on the camel back sofa (again), Kitty's father, a Faith and Begora tippling Irishman, (a la Charles Winninger the other flustered shamrock pater in all those Judy Garland vehicles), wisecracking plain Jane roommates who eat sandwiches as they let down Murphy Beds, and a really embarrassingly bad scene in which Kitty ""tells off"" her high born in laws, that seems drawn of equal parts Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Crawford, and Joan Blondell.After hearing her ""corn beef and cabbage are better than Beef Wellington!"" style denunciation, you'll be on the side of the aristocrats.It doesn't help that a puffy faced Rogers (then only 30) photographs much older, perhaps owing to an unflattering selection of brunette coiffures. Indeed, she looks MUCH better 10 years later, as witness the ""Manhatten Downbeat"" section of ""Barkleys of Broadway"" or ""Storm Warning"" (1951).At least this film's sets were able to be re-purposed to much greater advantage, particularly by Val Lewton in his ""Seventh Victim,"" (the speakeasy in ""Kitty Foyle"" receives better exposure as Natalie Cortez' Greenwich Village living room). Just for fun try to see how many other sets and props from ""KF"" end up in the ""Seventh Victim.""But for all that, even some of ""Kitty's"" own sets are leftovers, notably one first seen in the Lucile Ball vehicle, ""Beauty for the Asking.""Strictly for fans of left-over stew or films with unjustifiably high reputations.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------",2,A bundle of cliches.,1263945600,"01 20, 2010",2010,2330,"['One', 'celebrity', 'attached', 'film', 'What', 'offer', 'novel', 'merits', 'screen', 'play', 'tired', 'collection', 'pulpy', 'womens', 'magazine', 'clich', 'eacute', 'already', 'quite', 'played', 'out', '1940.For', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'lead', 'Kitty', 'anything', 'new', 'turf', 'hardly', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'fact', 'dialog', 'situations', 'retread', 'many', 'thirties', 'roles', 'listening', 'Kitty', 'one', 'echos', 'Rogers', '30s', 'working', 'class', 'melodramas', 'check', 'girl', 'manicurist', 'chorine', 'carnival', 'vendor', 'etc', 'girl', 'hard', 'boiled', 'bon', 'mots', 'conceal', 'inner', 'decency.Then', 'are', 'other', 'hackneyed', 'ingredients', 'have', 'example', 'tired', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'star', 'choice', 'two', 'stalwart', 'handsome', 'leading', 'men', 'Gladys', 'Cooper', 'mink', 'collar', 'camel', 'back', 'sofa', 'again', 'Kitty', 'father', 'Faith', 'Begora', 'tippling', 'Irishman', 'la', 'Charles', 'Winninger', 'other', 'flustered', 'shamrock', 'pater', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'vehicles', 'wisecracking', 'plain', 'Jane', 'roommates', 'who', 'eat', 'sandwiches', 'let', 'down', 'Murphy', 'Beds', 'really', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'scene', 'Kitty', 'tells', 'off', 'high', 'born', 'laws', 'drawn', 'equal', 'parts', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Joan', 'Blondell.After', 'hearing', 'corn', 'beef', 'cabbage', 'are', 'better', 'Beef', 'Wellington', 'style', 'denunciation', ""'ll"", 'be', 'side', 'aristocrats.It', ""n't"", 'help', 'puffy', 'faced', 'Rogers', 'then', 'only', '30', 'photographs', 'much', 'older', 'perhaps', 'owing', 'unflattering', 'selection', 'brunette', 'coiffures', 'Indeed', 'MUCH', 'better', '10', 'years', 'later', 'witness', 'Manhatten', 'Downbeat', 'section', 'Barkleys', 'Broadway', 'Storm', 'Warning', '1951', '.At', 'least', 'film', 'sets', 'were', 'able', 'be', 're-purposed', 'much', 'greater', 'advantage', 'particularly', 'Val', 'Lewton', 'Seventh', 'Victim', 'speakeasy', 'Kitty', 'Foyle', 'better', 'exposure', 'Natalie', 'Cortez', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'living', 'room', 'Just', 'fun', 'try', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'sets', 'props', 'KF', 'end', 'up', 'Seventh', 'Victim', 'even', 'Kitty', 'own', 'sets', 'are', 'leftovers', 'notably', 'one', 'first', 'seen', 'Lucile', 'Ball', 'vehicle', 'Beauty', 'Asking', 'Strictly', 'fans', 'left-over', 'stew', 'films', 'unjustifiably', 'high', 'reputations.']",Kitty Foyle VHS

370520,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6303360009,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 2]","Christopher Morley's 1939 novel was hot stuff, a best seller about a working girl who has an affair with a society gent, gets pregnant, and has an abortion.  Censorship prevented a direct screen adaptation, and when the movie arrived it found Kitty (Ginger Rogers) forced to choose between illicit passion with a magazine publisher (Dennis Morgan) and respectable love with a doctor (James Craig.)  At the time, the film was considered adult; today, it reads as fat-free cheese.Ginger Rogers was one of the hardest working actresses of the 1930s, and she occasionally scored in such films as STAGE DOOR, but she was generally thought of as a musical comedy actress who had the good fortune to team up with Fred Astaire.  In the 1940s she began to step away from that screen persona through a series of dramas, with the title role in KITTY FOYLE among her first efforts.  It was very different from her earlier performances, and it was solid enough to beat out Bette Davis, Joan Fontaine, Katherine Hepburn, and Martha Scott for the Oscar.  But Rogers is really the only thing the film has going for it.  Although the supporting cast is quite good, Morgan and Craig are pretty ho-hum and surprisingly interchangeable.  The narrative devices (Kitty arguing with herself in the mirror; the use of a snowglobe to seque from episode to episode; etc.) were greatly admired at the time, but today they seem clunky, and the script seems unduly high-flown.  Everything gets the Hollywood Glamour Treatment, whether it is appropriate or not.Whatever its merits from a modern standpoint, KITTY FOYLE has proven influential in a number of unexpected ways.  The snowglobe device  would return in CITIZEN KANE, and a dress designed for Rogers to wear in the film proved unexpectedly popular and durable and to this day is known as ""a Kitty Foyle dress"" in the fashion trade.  The DVD presents the film in good condition, and it offers a few bonuses that include two radio adaptations of the film.  KITTY FOYLE is very much a film of its time that could not transcend the limitations of its time, and so it is probably best left to admirers of 1940s melodrama and fans of Ginger Rogers.

She's decidedly out of character as a white-collar girl with an old school attitude.  I love when she grumbles, ""People always make a big deal about the Old West and the brave women of the covered wagons.  They don't seem to care as much about their modern-day equivalents, the secretaries--the women of the covered typewriters.""  With her quivering lower lip and her turned-up chin, she makes us care for Kitty Foyle, a girl from the poor side of the tracks who makes good with the rich playboy Wynnewood Strafford the III, or for short, ""Win,"" played skillfully by the wonderful Dennis Morgan, possibly Hollywood's most under-rated star player of the 1940s.  Morgan could sing too but he was best playing men whose love for their leading lady was always tested by some kind of addiction or other handicap, some sort of weakness.  Here his Achilles heel is his family and their swanky social position.Gladys Cooper would have a fit if she found out that Dennis was dating Ginger Rogers, and in the book of course, Kitty and Win don't get married but carry on a ""back street"" sex affair anyhow.  Moviegoers even in 1940s were agile enough to read between the lines and to guess that the baby Ginger loses in the movie was a real ""love child.""  You'd have to have a heart of stone not to feel strangle prickles behind your eyes, like tears, when Ginger realizes that she has lost the baby.  Luckily Dr. Mark is there to pick up the pieces--James Craig, another very good actor, playing a young intern who loves Kitty even despite the fact that her father's a boozehound and she will never enter the Social Register or Main Line Philly society.  I wonder if Grace Kelly ever saw KITTY FOYLE and based some of her choices in men on Kitty's Philadelphia binary.  Between this film and BACHELOR MOTHER you would think Ginger Rogers a very maternal figure, but anyone who met her in real life knew that there was no room for children in her heart; in some ways she was a very lonely lady despite her many accomplishments and all the famous men she attracted to her side (think ""Lady in the Dark,"" probably the part she played that was the most like the real life Ginger Rogers."")The subtitle of this movie was ""The Natural History of a Woman"" and was supposed to provide a quasi-scientific, or sociological, study of class.

370528,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6303360009,Martin Asiner,"[5, 6]","Whenever Ginger Rogers' name is bandied about, it is usually done so in the context of a musical, usually co-starring with Fred Astaire.  Her acting ability was most often hidden in a rousing background of song and dance.  But with KITTY FOYLE, Ginger showed that she could play it straight too.  Kitty is a lower class Irish lass who has the great bad luck to fall for an upper crust Philadelphia scion (Dennis Morgan) whose family has long since planned his future, one that does not include a poor Irishwoman.  They marry but the gap between them is too wide.  Exit the scion and enter a poor but kindly doctor (James Craig) who loves her enough for her to have to choose between them.The charm of KITTY FOYLE rests squarely on Miss Rogers' ability to create the aura of a woman who loves two men, although unequally.  Morgan and Craig are purposely bland, and very nearly interchangeable, so it is no surprise that Kitty bounces back and forth between them. Along the way, director Sam Wood presents New York as a backgound that is just perfect for young lovers to meet in quaint Italian restaurants.  Eduardo Ciannelli is cast against type as an Italian waiter who brings to mind Mister Botchagaloop of Abbott &amp; Costello fame.  By the time the closing credits roll, it comes only as a minor surprise as to which lover Kitty chooses.

One of the one star reviews captures perfectly my feelings, i.e. when is this thing ever going to end?  I cannot believe how boring and meaningless a movie this is.  It makes me wonder if the book from which it was adapted was just as dull or if they managed, somehow, to excise all the interesting parts when they wrote the script.No one, and I mean NO ONE of the characters has any depth whatsoever.  Kitty and what's his name...Wyn...fall madly in eternal love because they each find the other physically attractive.  Is that shallow or what?  The doctor dude falls for her because she's not a gold-digger.  Wow.  That's really delving into the character of someone you want to marry.  And he's hardly even in the picture, so to speak, and apparently sees Kitty all of 2-3 times before he sees her clutching some newborn and decides to pop the old question.  Drivel, I say.The weirdest, scariest part is that Kitty knows quite well Wyn has a 5 y.o. child as well as a wife whom he has no problem at all dumping to go live in South America and things it would be swell if Kitty were to tag along.  He doesn't care about his wife, child or Kitty's potential life as an unmarried slut.  He completely lacks character.  She, in turn, actually considers taking him up on his appalling proposal.  In fact, the entire movie is really all about her better nature trying to slap some sense into her.  I don't know, I just can't do justice in descibing the stupidity of this entirely ridiculous flick.In reality, people---women and men---make bad decisions all the time, every day.  And many movies have been made about human frailty and the consequences of falling in love with trashy people.  But generally those movies are a lot more entertaining than is ""Kitty Foyle"".I guess G.R. is okay and actually more or less transcends the lousy material she's given to work with.  Dennis what's-his'name?  He's so lame and corny it's really hard to imagine falling in love with him.  This guy's always shallow and ininteresting in whatever movie he's in.

370531,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6303360009,Simon Davis,"[11, 12]","Ginger Rogers really came into her own as the dramatic heroine of RKO's drama ""Kitty Foyle"" after her legendary collaborations with fred Astaire during the 1930's. Despite being almost solely regarded as Astaire's dancing partner Ginger Rogers had done a large number of films of a non dancing nature and by 1939 with their teamings coming to an end was anxious to develop her very fine comic and dramatic abilities. As seen in the previous years classic ""Bachelor Mother"", with David Niven she proved to be totally up to the task and this was followed in 1940 by the Sam Wood directed ""Kitty Foyle"", for which Rogers was awarded the Academy Award as Best Actress.""Kitty Foyle"" tells the quite simple story of a modern White Collar working girl who finds herself in the position of being courted by two entirely different men from different stations in life. Wyn Strafford (Dennis Morgan) offers Kitty the glamour of Philadelphia society in a lifestyle of priveldge, position and very set social values, while struggling intern Mark Eisen (James Craig) has only himself and his dreams to offer her. Growing up in the poor part of town Kitty as a child dreamt of the sort of life that Wyn represents, beautiful clothes, nice cars and appearances at all the society events like Philadephia's Assembly evening. Meeting and falling in love with Wyn Kitty thinks that all those earlier dreams have come true and soon she finds herself being swept off her feet into marriage with one of Philadelphia's best families. Meeting his family however finds Kitty being made only too aware of her humble beginnings and this clash of two different levels of society results in Kitty divorcing Wyn only to discover that she is carrying Wyn's child which she later loses in childbirth. Happily reciprocating Mark's uncomplicated love for her that involves no standards for her to be meeting, Kitty becomes engaged to him. Then as if by magic Wyn returns to her life yet again and momentarily arouses all those old passionate feelings she still has for him that she never really feels for Mark. With an offer to go away with him to South America, Kitty is for a moment prepared to abandon all to live this dream with Wyn again when her conscience reminds her of just what type of position she is placing herself in with the still married Wyn. Kitty begins to realise what a fine person Mark is and that he is a man who really loves her for herself and is waiting to marry her and give her the type of loving existence she really craves. Back to her senses Kitty decides to go ahead and marry Mark and have the loving marriage she has always wanted where she is appreciated for what she is, not who.Vintage soap opera it is indeed but ""Kitty Foyle"", shines with real characters and emotions that we can all identify with. Dennis Morgan does wonderful work as the besotted Wyn, the victim of family background and expectations and his screen chemistry with Ginger Rogers is magical and very romantic. James Craig as the humble doctor has the less flashy role of the two men but his simple playing and sincere dialogue really hits the right note in playing a character that has nothing but love to offer his beloved. There was alot of controversy in 1940 about whether Ginger Rogers really deserved the Oscar over the quite formidable competiton that year from Katherine Hepburn in ""The Philadelphia Story"", and especially Joan Fontaine in ""Rebecca"". The jury will always be out on that one I guess but Rogers playing of Kitty is wonderful and she has her best scene in her confrontation with Wyn's mother (Gladys Cooper in a small but wonderful performance). For that scene alone where she drives home a few truths about their family and the rules they live by, some award should have been forecoming.Nominated for a total of five Academy Awards ""Kitty Foyle"",could never be regarded as one of Hollywood's unforgettable classics. Ginger Rogers helps lift what is basically a soap opera to a higher level with her assured playing of the typical working girl who is both romantic and practical. It's a joy to see her in a dramatic role and it led the way for some other great dramatic performances by Rogers through the 1940's decade.

I think Ginger deserved it as well as any of the others. She is wonderful in this drama, and she portrays KItty with a certain realness. watch her facial expressions. I believe that Ginger had the most expressive and beautiful eyes in hollywood history. after losing her baby in childbirth, kitty's look on her face whenever she sees a child afterwards is devestating. the whole cast is fine, and you could cut Gin and Dennis Morgan's chemistry with a knife. Ginger had a strange power to bring out so much chemistry from all her leading men. In the early scenes, she is adorable as little kitty. I don't believe that this is a soap opera, because the situations are NOT ridiculous and the characters are very real, but nevertheless it is a heavier type of drama, so don't expect a SWING TIME-like experience, and keep the tissues handy.
