This is something like the third in the ""Eating Out"" series of films, and the very best of the lot so far.  There is an energy to this movie that comes from people who are obviously enjoying making it, but it's more than a fun romp for them.  This was a great time for me!I'm used to being underwhelmed or mildly amused by many of the independent films I've bought.  I not only work in the business (I have no connection with anything about these films), but I've loved watching independent films as much as the blockbusters.  You don't have to lower your expectations for this one.  It's top notch in every way. The writing is sharp and smart, full of zingers and humor.  The acting strikes just the right note for this film, and there's a chemistry between the actors that adds a special spark to the scenes.  The production values are high enough so they never get in the way, but instead support the film so the story and characters can do their thing without distraction.  It just works so well together as a whole!  The story is sweet and funny and sexy.  What's not to like?There are wonderful appearances by great actors, such as Rebekah Kochan, Mink Stole and Leslie Jordan, but also some surprising premiere appearances (as far as I know) of Daniel Skelton and Chris Salvatore who play the lead love interests.In this latest release from a very adept production team, I came away from ""Eating Out - All You Can Eat"" totally satisfied!

Rebekah Kochan--the notoriously trampy & bawdy Tiffani--is the only original cast member returning for a third go-round. After a shockingly bad opening scene (the script sacrifices credibility for sheer outrageousness--would people behave THIS badly during a funeral??) in which Tiffani makes her friend Kyle's (and his lover Marc's) funerals (you have to watch to get the details on their amusing demises) something to remember, the film steadily improves as it gets to its nitty-gritty story. Cute but slightly nerdy nephew Casey stays at Aunt Helen's place (John Waters cult icon Mink Stole) & volunteers at a gay support center. There, he meets what seems to be the boy of his dreams--Zak, a sweet guy who's suffering through his own bad relationship. Casey soon learns that Zak has broken up with the BF and, through Tiffani's guidance (or is that mis-guidance?) dons the ID of her hunky stripper ex-BF. What follows are adventures in online hook-ups, advice from older gays, stripping lessons (this comical steamy moment has to be seen to be believed), sabotaging ex-BFs, and so on. Casey & Zak are such good-hearted boys that you really want to see them get together. The script contains plenty of good zingers & one-liners, as well as raunchy moments that make it delightfully un-PC.The cast is appealing (and easy on the eyes). Kochan is at her good-intended but outrageous best. And ""Will & Grace"" recurring guest Leslie Howard adds a refreshing touch of gay comic flair.So, is EO3 better than the first two? Not really.
