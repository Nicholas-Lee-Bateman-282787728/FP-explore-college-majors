I have not seen Daniel Boone since a kid but remember I loved it and started with season two and I will soon own the whole five seasons. the only minor complaint I have is I wish the episodes would just keep running into each other. i work third shift and do fall asleep with them going and the choosing each episode every 45 minutes gets old just let them flow. But overall the quality and packaging and information is wonderful and this and Band of Brothers are my two best box sets. Wish there was more TV and movies from this  early 1800's timeframe but we have computer generated super heros and dumb remakes and and survivor that are all stupid enough to power todays viewer ratings.

When I saw that season one was black and white, I decided not to order it...although I may do so later.  But season two is just a delight.  Mingo is always so cool...and it has enough episodes that are more about family relationships, slavery issues, and less about fighting. There's plenty of that, too, though...if you're into snarking at the Friench - and our British ancestors. :-)  Little Israel is so cute! Interesting to see Veronica Cartright as Jemima, sister to Angela Cartright from Lost in Space.  I didn't remember her!

The former star of WALT DISNEY's phenomenally successful CROCKETT didn't even have to change coonskin caps for his long-running follow up hit. This fairly violent program featured the brave frontiersman, explorer, and occasional Indian fighter protecting the settlers of Boonesborough, including his sensible wife REBECCA, teen daughter JEMIMA and young son ISRAEL. Semi-regular cronies in later seasons included country warbler/future pork sausage king JIMMY DEAN, character actor ALBERT SALMI and ex-footballer ROSIE GRIER...but it was singer ED AMES' sensitive portrayal of cultured half-Cherokee MINGO who proved almost as popular as PARKER himself.

However, the last quarter of season 1 they abandoned the character of Yadkin. They didn't even write him out of the show. They keep Albert Salmi's name in the credits until the end of season 1 but he's not there at the end. They abandoned a few other of the people who live in and around the settlement too, like the future grandma Walton, who was featured in several season 1 episodes. At the end of this season, there is also a two part 'revisionist' episode retelling how the Kentucky settlement came to be. In season 1, Boone, married and already with his two kids, is asked by the patriots to go scouting in Kentucky for a place to build a new fort. He goes on foot with Yadkin and they meet Mingo when they save him from Mohawk Indians. He then helps Boone in the rest of the season 1 pilot. Later Boone and his family and a bunch of other settlers move through the Cumberland Gap, build a fort and a settlement. All that was the premise in season 1. At the end of season two in this two-part episode, they say that Daniel Boone, single and leading a group of covered wagons, are out as ""pioneers"" going to settle in Kentucky. No fort, no Indians, it was a joke of an insult to season 1. They did meet Mingo in this season ending ""new revisionist pilot"" but in different circumstances. I just want to know why? They obviously went to great thought and effort to revise this aspect of the show, what did they think the fans would think? I just want to know why. I just pretend, and advise new watchers of this season to just pretend that the last two episodes don't exist. Overlooking these problems, the show is still a good show to watch with the revolutionary war in the background of the plot occasionally spilling out west into Kentucky. They have the character Jericho Jones in this season, and I couldn't stand him. Kept waiting for him to get scalped or shot and written out. Maybe next season. Missed Yadkin even more. The theme music also changed somewhat, a variation of the original version with less banjo and more emphasis on acoustic guitar. A livelier version, it was just as good as the original music I guess. The episodes were not quite as original and historical or action filled as episode 1 but as I said still worth watching as only one of a couple of colonial era tv shows ever made.

She poppped it out at Christmas time and I remembered watching DB as a teen. Well I forgot how well this series was made. I liked season 1 so much I ordered season 2&3 about half way through season 1. I have just finished season 2 and started season 3. The series has evolved for the better. Even though I have half a MBA, I learned some things from American Colonial History I hadn't known about. I find these stories great. They always have a moral foundation and demonstrate family values with action and some humor. Fess Parker I grew up with as a little boy with his Davy Crockett Dismey series in the movies. Yes, I got the (man made materials)coonskin cap and enjoyed sining the Title song. Daniel Boone actualy was related to Davy Crockett as a great uncle I believe. If you like wilderness America like I do with the likes of Last of the Mohicans ala Randolph Scott, or Hawkeye from the late 50's TV show, you will love Fess Parker as Daniel Boone and Ed Ames as Mingo. Factoid:  TV's Richard Boone(Have Gun will Travel) is a direct descendant of Daniel Boone.

Since my family had a B&W; TV when I was growing up--until my older sister bought us a color TV with her own money--this is actually my first time seeing ""Daniel Boone"" in color.  It doesn't look much like Kentucky, but whatever part of California they filmed it in sure is pretty.As with season 1, the acting is still good.  Kind of miss Yadkin, but everyone else is back.  My sons (ages 12 & 10) love this show as much as I do, proving that you don't have to be crass to attract the modern kids--just tell good stories.One last thing, were Jemina's eyes really that blue or is that a trick of the restoration?",5,What a Great show!!,1182124800,"06 18, 2007",2007,662,"['Just', 'got', 'Season', '2', 'Amazon', 'great', 'family', 'had', 'B', 'W', 'TV', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'older', 'sister', 'bought', 'color', 'TV', 'own', 'money', 'actually', 'first', 'time', 'seeing', 'Daniel', 'Boone', 'color', ""n't"", 'look', 'much', 'Kentucky', 'part', 'California', 'filmed', 'sure', 'pretty.As', 'season', '1', 'acting', 'still', 'good', 'Kind', 'miss', 'Yadkin', 'everyone', 'else', 'back', 'sons', '12', '10', 'love', 'show', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'proving', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'crass', 'attract', 'modern', 'kids', 'just', 'tell', 'good', 'stories.One', 'last', 'thing', 'were', 'Jemina', 'eyes', 'really', 'blue', 'trick', 'restoration']",N/A
