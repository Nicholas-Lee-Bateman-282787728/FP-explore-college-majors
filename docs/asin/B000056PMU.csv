Throughout the whole movie, you can already imagine what is gonna happen in the next 5 minutes, it's that kind of movie. Definetly Arnold's worst, and speaking of Arnold movies, anyone seen Total Recall lately? Recall Corporations? Re-Pet Corporations? Noticing a similarity? There's even more of them, from the opening bedroom scene to the big chase scenes, this is simply a rehash of a much finer work. Instead of informing the viewer about both sides of the cloning debate, this movie takes on the opinion that anyone who wants to clone is an evil megalomaniac out to destroy human kind. I myself am strongly anti-cloning, but since when did other people's opinions become invalid? Think about that when you are hitting the non-helpful button.

570216,A1LBMDHBZJGJ44,B000056PMU,Alberto Diaz,"[0, 1]","The movie is not a crowning achievement, I'll tell you that, but it is fairly good, good old Arnold action, finally the cloning theme is exploited by filmmakers, the actors are not terrible, the actually do good, sure, not to run for best performance, but again, this is an Arnold film, just sit and relax while he gets the bad guys, plus he is getting out of his macho killing machine shell, he is now a family man with feelings, thing that makes Arnold better, he has tried to do different roles, different approaches, like in Jingle all the Way, Kindergarten Cop, Twins, Batman and Robin, and although all of these may not be good, at lest he is diverse, unlike Stallone, which will always be a killing machine, with no feelings, or a very expressive boxer, never a family fan, an please, let's hope he never gets to be one. But back to the movie, the good thing is that it is a new topic, so is not the old boring thing, plus, the soundtrack is fairly good, Trevor Rabin is not bad, also, the DVD has fairly good features, trailers for some movies beside this one, a some sort of featurette, talent files, a commentary, an isolated music score, better that what Paramount can come up with, plus, the sound and the picture are stunning, a great job of the DVD producers, also, the RCE, region coding enhancement was not a problem for my free-region DVD player. Some say that this movie about bad clones, is itself a bad clone of Total Recall, sure, the movies are very much a like, perhaps too much a like, if you have seen both you know what I mean, and sure, Total Recall is much better, I don't why, probably because it came first, and because action movies from Arnold were newer when Recall came out, about 10 years ago, but what the heck, this film is not BAD at all, if you are a fan of Arnold, or of action/sci-fi movies, or you are interested in cloning, the movie will suit you quite well.",3,ANOTHER 2 HOUR FUN RIDE IN THE SCHWARZENEGGER ROLLER COASTER,1009152000,"12 24, 2001",2001,1902,"['movie', 'not', 'crowning', 'achievement', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'fairly', 'good', 'good', 'old', 'Arnold', 'action', 'finally', 'cloning', 'theme', 'exploited', 'filmmakers', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'terrible', 'actually', 'do', 'good', 'sure', 'not', 'run', 'best', 'performance', 'again', 'Arnold', 'film', 'just', 'sit', 'relax', 'bad', 'guys', 'getting', 'macho', 'killing', 'machine', 'shell', 'now', 'family', 'man', 'feelings', 'thing', 'Arnold', 'better', 'tried', 'do', 'different', 'roles', 'different', 'approaches', 'Jingle', 'Way', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', 'Twins', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'lest', 'diverse', 'Stallone', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'killing', 'machine', 'feelings', 'very', 'expressive', 'boxer', 'never', 'family', 'fan', 'please', 'let', 'hope', 'never', 'be', 'one', 'back', 'movie', 'good', 'thing', 'new', 'topic', 'so', 'not', 'old', 'boring', 'thing', 'soundtrack', 'fairly', 'good', 'Trevor', 'Rabin', 'not', 'bad', 'also', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'good', 'features', 'trailers', 'movies', 'one', 'sort', 'featurette', 'talent', 'files', 'commentary', 'isolated', 'music', 'score', 'better', 'what', 'Paramount', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'sound', 'picture', 'are', 'stunning', 'great', 'job', 'DVD', 'producers', 'also', 'RCE', 'region', 'coding', 'enhancement', 'was', 'not', 'problem', 'free-region', 'DVD', 'player', 'say', 'movie', 'bad', 'clones', 'bad', 'clone', 'Total', 'Recall', 'sure', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'like', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'sure', 'Total', 'Recall', 'much', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'why', 'probably', 'came', 'first', 'action', 'movies', 'Arnold', 'were', 'newer', 'when', 'Recall', 'came', 'out', 'about', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'what', 'heck', 'film', 'not', 'BAD', 'are', 'fan', 'Arnold', 'action/sci-fi', 'movies', 'are', 'interested', 'cloning', 'movie', 'will', 'suit', 'quite', 'well']",N/A

This review is not written out of hero-worship or whatever; I'm writing it because I think the film is underrated.&quot;The Sixth Day&quot; is an action/science fiction movie and like &quot;The Matrix&quot; or &quot;Total Recall&quot; it raises some interesting philosophical and ethical questions for those who want to deal with them.  In a future society, pets can be cloned but cloning humans is strictly illegal.  Nonetheless, Arnold's character is cloned without him knowing it by the covert wing of a large corporation.  Because of the (highly plausible) plot mechanics, we don't know when we're dealing with the real Arnold or the cloned Arnold.  And since the clone is a flesh-bearing human with the same thoughts, memories, skills, and ideals as the original, the audience as well as the cast is confronted with the question:  can we really say the clone is inferior to the original in any meaningful way?I thoroughly enjoyed the futuristic design of this flick, which looks a lot like the present, but enhanced with the kind of technological goodies we've been promised for quite a while.  Hovering jet-copters like the Osprey are so common (and so much safer!) that well-heeled folk use them for sport.  Holographs are in every home.  People can order groceries by touching the refrigerator.  Cars can drive themselves on pre-determined routes.  Guns a lot more deadly.  Smoking is illegal, period.  Cloned &quot;Re-pets&quot; have become so common that parents commonly switch dead pets with them in the middle of the day to avoid telling their kids the facts of life and death, at least for now.  This mild satire on our materialistic, let's-not-look-at-death-it's-icky society offers welcome comic relief from the often gruesome action scenes, in which the malfeasant corporation tries its best to get rid of at least one of the Arnolds.Now, the idea of &quot;is he or isn't he&quot; is important throughout the movie but it is told with with skill, and I certainly don't think it is too challenging or outre for a mass audience to deal with.  Indeed, &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Total Recall&quot; had far more difficult premises, and audiences loved those flicks.  The action sequences were pretty standard action sequences, but not at all boring.  The city scenes were absolutely beautiful, skyscrapers fronting on glaciated bays surrounded by evergreens (Vancouver, B.C., Canada).  I thoroughly enjoyed this flick and believe it will stick with me as well as &quot;Total Recall.&quot;  It is not a routine flick.

570220,A1AHFIGBYPZTXC,B000056PMU,Amazon Customer,"[3, 4]","There are two kinds of classic Schwarzenegger characters: soldier and civilian. The soldier, as in Conan or Predator, is a no-nonsense grunt, taciturn and professionally grizzled. The civilian, in films like Raw Deal and Total Recall, is a pawn of The System who finds himself embroiled in events he never asked for and often couldn't even have imagined. You go to the theater to see Soldier Arnie in hopes of some first rate butt whupping. It's Civilian Arnie that delivers the one liners and the inadvertent comedy of mangled dialogue that's just so gut-bustingly funny that you can forgive everything else in the film. And with The 6th Day, the king of laughable action-drama returns to his throne!Directed by veteran Roger Spottiswoode who also helmed Air America and Tomorrow Never Dies, The 6th Day is mostly a clich&eacute;d rip-off of every other Schwarzenegger film. The effects are lackluster and the editing is at times incomprehensible but hey, what'd you expect? Arnie plays Adam Gibson, a charter pilot who discovers he's been illegally cloned and has to find a way to defeat the corrupt tycoon (Tony Goldwyn, Kiss The Girls) and the semi-corrupt doctor (Robert Duvall in the only decent performance in the film) who's cloning friends and associates willy nilly. And Michael &quot;Superboy&quot; Rapaport (Copland, Men of Honor) is the junior pilot and sidekick who receives some sage wisdom on piloting: &quot;Look more manly.&quot; Now I could go into the way the story demonizes science and gets all preachy about the value of human life, but that would be missing the point. The plot is just a formula on which to drape Our Hero. And it's anything but an original one.It takes place in the fairly near future and we get to see a lot of gags about the wonders of technology ala Total Recall: football helmets with HUD displays (&quot;Warning! Possible Blitz!&quot;), nacho flavored bananas, etc. One of the funniest is the Virtual Lawyer that shows up after the Gibson clone reports his car stolen, to be replaced by the Virtual Psychiatrist when Gibson himself claims he stole it. And of course the one item every man will want for Christmas 2025 - the Virtual Girlfriend. The jokes are pretty good by and large and make up mightily for the bad dialogue and uneven pacing - the mostly pointless explanatory scene will put you right to sleep.Of course none of this would mean anything without Ahnolde. He's looking a little long in the tooth lately and has all the grace of an ex-bodybuilder who's still so huge he can hardly walk, but for a guy in his 50's Arnie can still pull off some decent action. Not to mention that prodigious acting skill. If you thought he was funny in Raw Deal, imagine a scene in which Arnold does some light comedy relief opposite himself! Add to this the instant classic (which he uses twice on the same guy) &quot;Vy don't you go clone yourzelf?&quot;  &quot;Why?&quot;  &quot;Zo you can .... yourzelf!&quot; and you got yourself a howler of a performance!Schwarzenegger's got a few more years of action films left provided he doesn't engage in too many experiments like Twins or Jingle All The Way, and his most laughably bad performances are probably behind him, but The 6th Day is a welcome return to the Arnie of yore.",4,Arnie returns in good form!,976060800,"12 6, 2000",2000,3270,"['are', 'two', 'kinds', 'classic', 'Schwarzenegger', 'characters', 'soldier', 'civilian', 'soldier', 'Conan', 'Predator', 'no-nonsense', 'grunt', 'taciturn', 'professionally', 'grizzled', 'civilian', 'films', 'Raw', 'Deal', 'Total', 'Recall', 'pawn', 'System', 'who', 'embroiled', 'events', 'never', 'asked', 'often', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'imagined', 'go', 'theater', 'see', 'Soldier', 'Arnie', 'hopes', 'first', 'rate', 'butt', 'whupping', 'Civilian', 'Arnie', 'one', 'liners', 'inadvertent', 'comedy', 'mangled', 'dialogue', 'just', 'so', 'gut-bustingly', 'funny', 'can', 'forgive', 'everything', 'else', 'film', '6th', 'Day', 'king', 'laughable', 'action-drama', 'returns', 'throne', 'Directed', 'veteran', 'Roger', 'Spottiswoode', 'who', 'also', 'helmed', 'Air', 'America', 'Tomorrow', 'Never', 'Dies', '6th', 'Day', 'mostly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'rip-off', 'other', 'Schwarzenegger', 'film', 'effects', 'are', 'lackluster', 'editing', 'times', 'incomprehensible', 'hey', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Arnie', 'Adam', 'Gibson', 'charter', 'pilot', 'who', 'been', 'illegally', 'cloned', 'find', 'way', 'defeat', 'corrupt', 'tycoon', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'Kiss', 'Girls', 'semi-corrupt', 'doctor', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'only', 'decent', 'performance', 'film', 'who', 'cloning', 'friends', 'associates', 'willy', 'nilly', 'Michael', 'quot', 'Superboy', 'quot', 'Rapaport', 'Copland', 'Men', 'Honor', 'junior', 'pilot', 'sidekick', 'who', 'sage', 'wisdom', 'piloting', 'quot', 'Look', 'more', 'manly.', 'quot', 'Now', 'could', 'go', 'way', 'story', 'science', 'preachy', 'value', 'human', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'missing', 'point', 'plot', 'just', 'formula', 'drape', 'Hero', 'anything', 'original', 'one.It', 'place', 'fairly', 'near', 'future', 'get', 'see', 'lot', 'gags', 'wonders', 'technology', 'ala', 'Total', 'Recall', 'football', 'helmets', 'HUD', 'displays', 'quot', 'Warning', 'Possible', 'Blitz', 'quot', 'nacho', 'flavored', 'bananas', 'etc', 'One', 'funniest', 'Virtual', 'Lawyer', 'up', 'Gibson', 'clone', 'car', 'stolen', 'be', 'replaced', 'Virtual', 'Psychiatrist', 'when', 'Gibson', 'stole', 'course', 'one', 'item', 'man', 'will', 'want', 'Christmas', '2025', 'Virtual', 'Girlfriend', 'jokes', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'large', 'make', 'up', 'mightily', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'uneven', 'pacing', 'mostly', 'pointless', 'explanatory', 'scene', 'will', 'put', 'right', 'sleep.Of', 'course', 'none', 'would', 'mean', 'anything', 'Ahnolde', 'looking', 'little', 'long', 'tooth', 'lately', 'grace', 'ex-bodybuilder', 'who', 'still', 'so', 'huge', 'can', 'hardly', 'walk', 'guy', '50', 'Arnie', 'can', 'still', 'pull', 'off', 'decent', 'action', 'Not', 'mention', 'prodigious', 'acting', 'skill', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'Raw', 'Deal', 'imagine', 'scene', 'Arnold', 'light', 'comedy', 'relief', 'opposite', 'Add', 'instant', 'classic', 'twice', 'same', 'guy', 'quot', 'Vy', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'clone', 'quot', 'quot', 'Why', 'quot', 'quot', 'Zo', 'can', 'quot', 'got', 'howler', 'performance', 'Schwarzenegger', 'got', 'few', 'more', 'years', 'action', 'films', 'left', 'provided', ""n't"", 'engage', 'too', 'many', 'experiments', 'Twins', 'Jingle', 'Way', 'most', 'laughably', 'bad', 'performances', 'are', 'probably', '6th', 'Day', 'welcome', 'return', 'Arnie', 'yore']",N/A

He was accused of rushing in and taking any part, regardless of the quality of the script. Well, I disagreed with the critics on &quot;End of Days&quot;; I thought the story was pretty good and it was a nice change to see him in the role of a vulnerable, fragile, average guy. The 6th Day puts Arnold back into a familiar character that we, the fans, are used to. He's back as the larger than life action hero! Performing death defying, super human feats and kicking everyone's butt along the way. This is the role that all Arnold fans (and critics for that matter) seem to be most comfortable seeing him in. That being said, I don't think this is a bad movie; on the contrary, I really liked this flick! When it come to this genre of movies, Arnold has a strangle hold on the industry. One quick note, If you look carefully, they use Arnold's stunt double allot in this movie...I guess he's not a 100% physically. Like most of my reviews, I won't describe the plot of the movie because you either read it before, or through one form or another, have been told the plot. What I will say about the movie is, the story has a great premise and touches on a current moral issue...Cloning, and the probably inevitable misuse of the technology. The movie has a nice flow to it; from beginning to end the story stays strong and keeps you hungry for the finality (that has a little twist to it). But what makes this a movie to buy, and not just rent, is the quality of the DVD.

570222,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000056PMU,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","`The 6th Day' is a little long, and it has been done better since (both `Minority Report' and `The Island' took aspects of this film and embellished them to far greater and more effective heights) but in the end, if you are looking for an engaging and exciting popcorn muncher, this film will do the trick.The film feels very familiar, even back upon its release.  Arnold plays a `regular guy' (if that is possible) who finds himself trying to take back his life after he is cloned and his clone takes over his house.  Since human cloning is outlawed if Arnold (I mean ADAM) doesn't prove he's the `real' human then he will be killed.  There is conspiracy, obviously, but in the end it doesn't really matter (when does it ever, in this genre at least).  The only important thing here is the action sequences, and this one delivers a few good ones.I don't really get the whole `this one will make you think' theory.  As far as chilling depictions of our future, I always found `Minority Report' to be the more intellectually stimulating, but then again, I don't buy into either depiction as an accurate example of what our future will be.  I mean, every time the future is discussed in these types of films things just seem far too `off' to be real.This is why I totally love what Godard did all the way back in 1965 when he took a realistic approach to `Alphaville'.Alas...Arnold is not an actor.  I mean, really...he is just a prop in a sea of explosions, but he knows how to sell it so good for him.  He doesn't do anything remotely special here, but he doesn't botch anything up either.  I happen to think that Michael Rooker is an actor and I actually think that he steals his scenes here, but that's a give in.

It is filled with good gun battles, chase scenes and many cool futuristic stuff.  This movie had a good plot and beside of all the cheesy humor, it is definitely a good film.  I just saw this on ABC (It premiered today) and I loved it.  Here is the movie's plot.Arnold is Adam Gibson.  An average man whose life soon changes into a total nightmare.  When a secret organization has Adam and many other people take an eye test, what the people do not know is that the organization has also taken their dna and ""Sincord"" (their whole memory which has been put on a disk) and uses it to create clones of them.  The man who does this is Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn).  His plan is to create a whole group of clones to help one day make lawyers change the law that states human cannot be cloned.  But in order do have this become successful, he mast eliminate (or in simpler terms-KILL) every person he clones in order to erase the evidence. After all, they can't two of the same person running around.  Anyway, Adam one day comes homes and sees that someone in his home looks just like him!  Before he knows it, there is a group of assassins out trying to kill him.  But it seems that doing that won't be easy for them to accomplish.  But it also doesn't seem that killing the assassins will not make things so much easier because they will just get cloned and go after him again.  Adam, manages to get away from then but now realizes his life is ruined.  Now kill the organization and Michael Drucker before they can kill him and try to find a way to get his life back.Anyway, the 6th day is a good action packed film.  The covers says ""Two Thumbs Up"" and believe me, I give it 2 thumbs up.  Unless if T3 isn't a bomb, this is Arnold's last good film.  Its definitely  better then END OF DAYS and COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

The author of this review was either hung over, still drunk from the night before or extremely slap-happy while viewing this movie- probably a mixture of three. However, if you plan on seeing this movie in any of these mind-altered states, take this review to heart.)Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have the movie that will be cleaning up at the Oscars this year. Two words- Sixth Day. The religious reference in the title is almost enough to give you chills before you've seen the movie. And this truly is some of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best work.During the movie I overheard a gentlemen named Backdoor say ""Oscar clip!"" at a particularly touching moment between Arnold and his wife. I understood the sentiment because the scene nearly brought me to tears.The typical Arnold movie has a one-liner. That is half the reason for seeing his movies. In the past we have gotten such gems as ""Hasta la vista, Baby"" and ""It's not a tum-uh."" This movie has more one-liners than all of his past movies combined. My personal favorite is during a scene when Arnold is carrying around a woman's thumb (to gain entrance into building where your thumbprint is your ID) and he accidentally drops the thumb in front of a security guard. Arnold hastily picks up the thump and says apologetically to the security guard, ""I'm all thumbs today."" Can you get better than that?The special effects in this movie, a futuristic action-thriller, are phenomenal. It is almost impossible not to get totally lost in the believable plot line. The planes / helicopters are faster and can be flown by wrist controls. The hairstyles are totally futuristic and crazy and, most importantly, there are virtual women you can download to you apartment to have virtual sex with you- a probable turn on for some viewers.This is movie is awesome. I cannot stress this enough. See it for the flagrant flipping, the glass that shatters a little too much and the people that have delayed-falls through glass ceilings.

Cars can drive themselves, holograms are commonplace, helicopters can turn into jets and pistols fire lasers. But the most important difference is the widespread use of cloning technology. If your pet dies why not get it cloned? It's mind can be uploaded into a computer chip as long as it's still fresh and then downloaded into the cloned body through the eyes. The pet's back, good as new, and nobody could tell the difference. Of course a human mind is supposedly too complex for this procedure and human cloning is illegal anyway. However a corporation is secretly cloning humans as a way to achieve immortality, with the best intentions of course. No one wants to die and a clone is essentially the same person as the original.This time they've made a bit of a booboo and they've cloned poor Adam Gibson while he's still alive. The poor guy comes home after a long day's work to find that he's already there. And to top it off people are trying to kill him and no matter how many times he kills the assassins they keep coming back. It's up to Adam to get his life back, defeat the bad guys and think of some witty one-liners to say while doing it.The 6th Day raises some interesting metaphysical questions. If a person's mind can be stored in a computer chip and copied endlessly, is there really such a thing as a soul? Is a clone the same person as the original, considering they have exactly the same personality and memories? Is this really a triumph over death or just a delusion based on downloaded memories?Some people have complained that this movie shows a very unrealistic portrayal of cloning. It involves an adult-sized fetus which is injected with the DNA of the person being cloned and then left to develop into that person before having the person's mind downloaded into its brain. The scriptwriters seemed to think this wasn't much different from today's cloning which kinda ruins the movie's message a bit but it doesn't really matter. The 6th Day is a great action-packed thriller for lovers of sci-fi and Schwarzenegger.",5,An intelligent sci-fi action movie from your old pal Arnie,1186617600,"08 9, 2007",2007,2166,"['Adam', 'Gibson', 'average', 'guy', 'living', 'near-future', '2015', 'according', 'Schwarzenegger', 'nice', 'place', 'live', 'Cars', 'can', 'drive', 'holograms', 'are', 'commonplace', 'helicopters', 'can', 'turn', 'jets', 'pistols', 'fire', 'lasers', 'most', 'important', 'difference', 'widespread', 'use', 'cloning', 'technology', 'pet', 'dies', 'why', 'not', 'get', 'cloned', 'mind', 'can', 'be', 'uploaded', 'computer', 'chip', 'as', 'long', 'still', 'fresh', 'then', 'downloaded', 'cloned', 'body', 'eyes', 'pet', 'back', 'good', 'new', 'nobody', 'could', 'tell', 'difference', 'course', 'human', 'mind', 'supposedly', 'too', 'complex', 'procedure', 'human', 'cloning', 'illegal', 'anyway', 'However', 'corporation', 'secretly', 'cloning', 'humans', 'way', 'achieve', 'immortality', 'best', 'intentions', 'course', 'one', 'die', 'clone', 'essentially', 'same', 'person', 'original.This', 'time', ""'ve"", 'made', 'bit', 'booboo', ""'ve"", 'cloned', 'poor', 'Adam', 'Gibson', 'still', 'alive', 'poor', 'guy', 'home', 'long', 'day', 'work', 'find', 'already', 'there', 'top', 'off', 'people', 'are', 'trying', 'kill', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'assassins', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'up', 'Adam', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'defeat', 'bad', 'guys', 'think', 'witty', 'one-liners', 'say', 'doing', 'it.The', '6th', 'Day', 'interesting', 'metaphysical', 'questions', 'person', 'mind', 'can', 'be', 'stored', 'computer', 'chip', 'copied', 'endlessly', 'there', 'really', 'such', 'thing', 'soul', 'clone', 'same', 'person', 'original', 'considering', 'have', 'exactly', 'same', 'personality', 'memories', 'really', 'triumph', 'death', 'just', 'delusion', 'based', 'downloaded', 'memories', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'movie', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'portrayal', 'cloning', 'adult-sized', 'fetus', 'injected', 'DNA', 'person', 'being', 'cloned', 'then', 'left', 'develop', 'person', 'having', 'person', 'mind', 'downloaded', 'brain', 'scriptwriters', 'seemed', 'think', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'different', 'today', 'cloning', 'kinda', 'movie', 'message', 'bit', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', '6th', 'Day', 'great', 'action-packed', 'thriller', 'lovers', 'sci-fi', 'Schwarzenegger']",N/A

It was fun, flashy, exciting, with impressive visuals and special effects, but ultimately, it seemed hollow to me.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a Ahnold movie as much as the next guy, but I got the feeling that with a different star and a slight change in direction, this could have been an excellent thriller instead of a decent, yet empty, action movie.  The plot of the movie focuses on the subject of human cloning, but only enough to move the action along.  With a little more intelligence and a few less explosions, gun battles, and car chases, I feel we could have been treated to a movie on the same level as Minority Report, or Gattaca.  Oh well....Basically, the rundown of the movie is Arnold play Adam Gibson, a helicopter pilot who becomes entangled in a conspiracy after he finds out he's been cloned and his clone has taken over his life.  As with so many movies in the past ten years or so, the entity behind the conspiracy is an evil corporation/gooberment doing something they shouldn't be doing, and now they must kill Arnold so they can protect their secret.  Arnold is hunted, and then, with the help of his clone, tries to turn the tables and expose the conspiracy.  The concept of two Arnolds was pretty cool, but seemed more of a novelty than anything else.  A great looking movie with lots of great scenery, excitement, and special effects, but ultimately a hollow one due to lack of character development and glazing over of the rather thorny issue that is the core of the movie.There are a number of special features, bios, trailers, production notes but if you want more in this respect, look for the 2 disc Special Edition.  Oh yeah, thanks Columbia/Tristar for re-releasing the 2 disc special edition after I bought the original, single disc release, as I love shelling out money for the same movie twice if I want to get in on the extras not included in the initial release.

And it's not because he's humanitarian, he's just protecting his interests. And his wallet. Let's just say that when one of the players of his football team gets injured, he order his henchmen to kill him so they can later replace him for a new, healthy clon.So when Drucker thinks his pilot Adam Gibson (Schwarzenegger) is dead, he clones him immediately. Bad move! It was all a big misunderstanding, but there are now two Adam Gibson on the city. Since cloning humans is illegal, Drucker sends his henchmen to eliminate the one Gibson that knows the truth.I know, I know, sounds like a basic Schwarzenegger movie, and yes, it is. But is also way better than a lot of the sci-fi movies I've seen lately. And besides, you can see that Schwarzenegger's acting is a little better since he had his heart surgery.

Of course, I don't think this is one that movie critis will love, but I do love it.We know Schwarzenegger and Stallone were great during the 80s, but their careers went south recently.

The film had the appropriate action scenes and the smart dialogue to entice a vast audience. It's lukewarm reception is due solely to the cold fact that Arnold Schwartzenegger is too old to star in this sort of role. Am I a teenager looking down upon middle age males? On the contrary, I'm about the same age as the 53 year old muscle man star. We are both eligible to join the American Association of Retired People (AARP). Nevertheless, I am simply realistic enough to recognize that Arnold continues playing parts meant for a man 20 years younger than himself. The boy in the movie, for instance, was not merely old enough to be Arnold's son, he was also young enough to be his grandson! Schwartzenegger tries to pretend that he's perpetually in his mid 30s--and the results are embarrassing to say the least.Now that I've highlighted my major point regarding the age issue, what did I think of the overall movie? I liked it immensely and encourage anyone who is philosophically inclined to make sure they view &quot;The 6th Day.&quot; Robert Duval as a conscience stricken scientist and Tony Goldwyn as the cloned billionaire are faultless. The latter especially gave such a strong performance that he may have deserved an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor.  Those who usually prefer the so called serious intellectual flicks will not be disappointed. There is a particularly poignant scene where a cloned assassin blurts out that he's tired of being killed and revived so often within a 24 hour period. This bit of dark humor is akin to sharp punch to the solar plexus. One is forced to wonder if this might become an everyday reality sometime in the not too distant future. There are many similar scenes that will challenge the viewer. &quot;The Sixth Day&quot; attempts to be both escapist entertainment and profoundly existential--and delivers on both levels. The pressing issue of cloning will increasingly dominate both our political and cultural landscape. I personally doubt if we will ever be able to perfectly clone an individual human being. This daunting task would demand the talent to clone not just the physical dimension of the unique person, but also their psychological and intellectual. But what if I'm ultimately proven to be incorrect? As for my earlier comments regarding Arnold's advancing age? Please don't shoot the messenger. Also, are the vast majority of movie fans guilty of unjust age discrimination? I think not. There's simply a point where one has to admit and graciously accept the honorable condition of being middle age. The general public has a right to expect this from you.

The filmmaker takes a hot-button topic like cloning and turns it into a thriller with a mind and a heart. Pets in the not-too-distant future can be brought back to life in new bodies, but human cloning has been banned, for obvious moral/scientific reasons. He plays a pilot who is assigned a charter to ferry a billionare. Things after that become very intense,resulting in the cloning of Arnold, and with mind-blowing action scenes not seen since T2-Judgement Day.

Unlike his friends and those who have taken an extreme liking to the recent developments in genetics and technology, Gibson doesn't warm to the idea of cloned pets or life-like dolls; when the family dog takes ill and must be put down, he is hesitant to have it restored. As a lightening of the emotional load for his daughter, he buys her a doll; later that night, he returns home to find his dog very much alive again, and he, himself, inside his house blowing out the candles on his birthday cake.Soon, he is being pursued by a group of gun-toting thugs out to keep him from destroying their master plans of proving to the world that human cloning is a legitimate business. At the top of this are two men: wealthy visionary Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn) and brilliant scientist Dr. Griffin Weir (Robert Duvall), who both believe in their theories to the extent that they break the law by producing human clones. At one point, we discover that Weir has gone so far as to clone his own wife, a deed that will have its repercussions once things start getting out of hand, and the race to prevent Gibson from spoiling their plans becomes heated.One of the good things about the movie is its director, who spends his time working story and style together without trying to outdo one or the other. Never once do we get the impression that Spottiswoode is trying to dazzle us with a vision of the future in which humans drive around in flying saucers instead of cars; no, the world as seen in ""The 6th Day"" could very well be the near future as it so foresees it. The humor that lies with the inclusion of the Sim-Pal Cindy doll, as well as a series of questions that takes the place of a 9-1-1 operator, is superbly funny, yet also carries a certain degree of unsettling realism that resonates from the fact that we, as a society, are pretty much headed towards.Spottiswoode also avoids the usual pitfalls of action and science fiction, many of which come back to that fine line between style and substance; here, the two find a common nesting ground. The set pieces are a combination of elements that include standard car pursuits crossed with frenzied, quick-cut pacing, all of which adds to a frenetic pacing that keeps the material moving at a brisk pace. The story itself merits the rather-lengthy running time, keeping us involved by bringing us from one subplot to the next without overlapping too many at one time. It all leads up to a standard, shoot-'em-up-blow-it-up ending that we know is coming, but fits the material.And then we have Schwarzenegger, who is at the top of his game as a father and a hero rolled into one. The hard edge that has become is trademark is slipping away with his youth, no doubt, but his presence is still strong, as is his humor, which manages to get the film's biggest laughs. At one point, when confronted by two security guards while escaping with his family, he says, ""I don't want to expose my daughter to any kind of graphic violence. She already gets enough of that from the media.""This is the kind of movie where people come out of the theater and start arguing over its ideas. ""The 6th Day,"" in all its visual and intense glory, manages to keep us involved with the material by incorporating a story that is thought-provoking and eerie. It's also a great Arnie vehicle, replete with plenty of star power and thrills, and while the presence of a baffling plot twist in the beginning of the movie's third act (is the Adam Gibson we have come to believe as real actually the clone as Drucker says?), you can bet it qualifies as terrific entertainment.",4,Interesting without being insulting.,1011916800,"01 25, 2002",2002,4813,"['6th', 'Day', 'futuristic', 'action', 'thriller', 'set', 'near', 'future', 'sooner', 'think', 'say', 'informative', 'opening', 'captions', 'world', 'where', 'cloning', 'humans', 'law', 'one', 'everyday', 'activity', 'could', 'include', 'trip', 'RePet', 'where', 'dead', 'Chihuahua', 'may', 'be', 'cloned', 'back', 'life', 'daughter', 'may', 'purchase', 'Sim-Pal', 'Cindy', 'doll', 'life-size', 'toy', 'real', 'hair', 'talks', 'world', 'people', 'rely', 'computers', 'moreso', 'people', 'today', 'portrait', 'humorous', 'same', 'time', 'chillingly', 'not', 'Roger', 'Spottiswoode', 'action', 'vehicle', 'offer', 'addition', 'wonderful', 'brand', 'comedic', 'relief', 'movie', 'also', 'punch', 'plenty', 'thrilling', 'set', 'pieces', 'chases', 'pyrotechnics', 'featuring', 'all-time', 'action', 'great', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'real', 'shocker', 'story', 'instead', 'being', 'mere', 'structure', 'array', 'stunts', 'thrillrides', 'actually', 'good', 'deal', 'interesting', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'interesting', 'coming', 'off', 'insulting', 'one', 'intelligence.Schwarzenegger', 'Adam', 'Gibson', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'small', 'airport', 'city', 'where', 'wife', 'child', 'live', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'taken', 'extreme', 'liking', 'recent', 'developments', 'genetics', 'technology', 'Gibson', ""n't"", 'warm', 'idea', 'cloned', 'pets', 'life-like', 'dolls', 'when', 'family', 'dog', 'ill', 'must', 'be', 'put', 'down', 'hesitant', 'have', 'restored', 'lightening', 'emotional', 'load', 'daughter', 'doll', 'later', 'night', 'home', 'find', 'dog', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'again', 'house', 'blowing', 'out', 'candles', 'birthday', 'cake.Soon', 'being', 'pursued', 'group', 'gun-toting', 'thugs', 'out', 'keep', 'destroying', 'master', 'plans', 'proving', 'world', 'human', 'cloning', 'legitimate', 'business', 'top', 'are', 'two', 'men', 'wealthy', 'visionary', 'Michael', 'Drucker', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'brilliant', 'scientist', 'Dr.', 'Griffin', 'Weir', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'who', 'believe', 'theories', 'extent', 'break', 'law', 'producing', 'human', 'clones', 'one', 'point', 'discover', 'Weir', 'gone', 'so', 'far', 'clone', 'own', 'wife', 'deed', 'will', 'have', 'repercussions', 'once', 'things', 'start', 'getting', 'hand', 'race', 'prevent', 'Gibson', 'spoiling', 'plans', 'heated.One', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'director', 'who', 'time', 'working', 'story', 'style', 'together', 'trying', 'outdo', 'one', 'other', 'Never', 'once', 'do', 'get', 'impression', 'Spottiswoode', 'trying', 'dazzle', 'vision', 'future', 'humans', 'drive', 'flying', 'saucers', 'instead', 'cars', 'world', 'seen', '6th', 'Day', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'near', 'future', 'so', 'humor', 'inclusion', 'Sim-Pal', 'Cindy', 'doll', 'as', 'well', 'series', 'questions', 'place', '9-1-1', 'operator', 'superbly', 'funny', 'yet', 'also', 'certain', 'degree', 'unsettling', 'realism', 'fact', 'society', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'headed', 'towards.Spottiswoode', 'also', 'usual', 'pitfalls', 'action', 'science', 'fiction', 'many', 'come', 'back', 'fine', 'line', 'style', 'substance', 'here', 'two', 'find', 'common', 'nesting', 'ground', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'combination', 'elements', 'include', 'standard', 'car', 'pursuits', 'crossed', 'frenzied', 'quick-cut', 'pacing', 'frenetic', 'pacing', 'material', 'moving', 'brisk', 'pace', 'story', 'rather-lengthy', 'running', 'time', 'keeping', 'involved', 'bringing', 'one', 'subplot', 'next', 'overlapping', 'too', 'many', 'one', 'time', 'up', 'standard', ""shoot-'em-up-blow-it-up"", 'ending', 'know', 'coming', 'material.And', 'then', 'have', 'Schwarzenegger', 'who', 'top', 'game', 'father', 'hero', 'rolled', 'one', 'hard', 'edge', 'become', 'trademark', 'slipping', 'away', 'youth', 'doubt', 'presence', 'still', 'strong', 'humor', 'get', 'film', 'biggest', 'laughs', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'confronted', 'two', 'security', 'guards', 'escaping', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'expose', 'daughter', 'kind', 'graphic', 'violence', 'already', 'enough', 'media', 'kind', 'movie', 'where', 'people', 'come', 'theater', 'start', 'arguing', 'ideas', '6th', 'Day', 'visual', 'intense', 'glory', 'keep', 'involved', 'material', 'incorporating', 'story', 'thought-provoking', 'eerie', 'also', 'great', 'Arnie', 'vehicle', 'replete', 'plenty', 'star', 'power', 'thrills', 'presence', 'baffling', 'plot', 'twist', 'beginning', 'movie', 'third', 'act', 'Adam', 'Gibson', 'have', 'come', 'believe', 'real', 'actually', 'clone', 'Drucker', 'can', 'bet', 'terrific', 'entertainment']",N/A

570248,A3VQLTB724O77W,B000056PMU,Dr. Christopher Coleman,"[1, 1]","Okay, let's get it out of the way right at the beginning: the &quot;science&quot; in this film is total fiction.  I have no doubt that cloned humans are an inevitability--indeed, with some precautions I see that as a great benefit to mankind rather than the ultimate hubris that will likely bring his downfall.  But regardless--cloning as shown in this movie is absurd, with &quot;blanks&quot; shorn of their DNA individuality that can be refined into adult people as diverse as Schwarzenegger or perhaps Gary Coleman in two hours.  Likewise, the recording, reading, and transplanting of memory is not within our reach, and certainly not at instantaneous speeds through the eyes.Having ranted thusly and demonstrated my unwilling suspension of disbelief, though, I did enjoy The Sixth Day.  Schwarzenegger is not my favorite action hero, but he has picked some interesting projects (such as Total Recall and Predator) that engage the mind while simultaneously disengaging it. He provides occasional relief from the relentless-dodging-buckets-of-bullets mindlessness so often seen.  Indeed, in this movie there are very few bullets at all--instead Arnold ducks showers of sparks and laser beams.  But he's doing it in the context of an interesting story that is fairly well written, well acted other than Arnie (Tony Goldwyn as a Bill Gates-esque villain was particularly good, as was Robert Duvall) with good special effects, cinematography and music.My criticisms of the movie are directed at the Hollywood mindset, which reared its ugly head too often.  The ending just has to be happy, with all the loose ends neatly wrapped up; and I really abhor plotlines that introduce devices like the remote control for Arnie's helicopter (or Sigourney Weaver's robot loader in Aliens) so obviously that you want to shout at the screen &quot;That's how he's going to save the day!&quot;The music, by former Yes guitarist Trevor Rabin, is quite good and perfectly fitting.  The DVD includes an isolated music track with Rabin's commentary.  As a composer and Yes fan I was looking forward to that, but Rabin is practically inarticulate and is unable to offer any real insight into his own creative process.  After about fifteen minutes I couldn't stand the inanity (on the order of &quot;This is the 'Cloning' Theme.  Um. I called it that because we use it on the cloning cues. Um. And you have to call it something.&quot;--okay, that's not a word-for-word transcript, um, but pretty, um, close.)  The other extras worth a mention are the &quot;RePet&quot; commercials--kind of creepy, but you pretty much see it all in the film anyway.

Edwards,"[0, 0]","This review is for ""The 6th Day"" (Special Edition) DVD Release Date: 2002PLEASE NOTE THAT ONCE AGAIN AMAZON HAS LUMPED REVIEWS FOR ALL VERSIONS OF ""The 6th Day,"" THUS DENIGRATING THIS DVD VERSION!!!I find it completely incomprehensible that viewers actually conceive of ""The 6th Day"" as a remake or some other incarnation of ""Total Recall.""  The premise of both movies is completely different.  The only commonality I find in the two movies is they are both excellent science fiction films, and they both are outstanding examples of movie entertainment.The premise of ""Total Recall"" is that the main character has had his memory ""ineptly"" altered so that he begins to remember the ""truth,"" and then deal with it.  The premise of ""The 6th Day"" is one in which the main character, Adam (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) is cloned, for nefarious reasons, without his knowledge.  However, Adam, who was supposed to be killed, quickly discovers that he has been cloned, and sets out to regain his life and family.  Moreover, while altering a person's memory is almost ""routine"" in ""Total Recall,"" cloning of humans is expressly forbidden in ""The 6th Day"" (law).  Hence, Adam must set out to prove who he is in ""The 6th Day,"" while Douglas Quaid (also played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) in ""Total Recall"" is trying to unearth the ""truth,"" or his real memories.While I am unsure of why a second disc was needed, the bonus features add nicely to the film itself.  And while I will always view ""The Villain"" as my favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger film, ""The 6th Day"" is better than many of his movies.  The director, Roger Spottiswoode, has provided a movie that delivers plenty of suspense and turn-around surprises, raises issues about cloning (albeit, not in any thought provoking fashion), and ""plenty of good entertainment.""  ""The 6th Day"" is science fiction action at its very best, and well worth owning.Please Note: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.

Now i know Arnold is getting too old for the action movies he was in during the 80's like predator and Commando but that doesn't mean he's lost his touch. He's just as good in this as all his older movies. This time the plot involves something that is really happening in our world and what would happen if it was in the hands of somebody who would abuse it or use as a means to kill or blackmail others. But when an assanation of an important person occurs, the corporation decides to cover it up by cloning the people killed. Unfortunaly the pilot who was supposed to fly the plane left to take care of his daughters dog. So Now there are two Adam Gibson's (Arnold Schwarzenegger) running around, and now the corporation is hunting them down to destroy either one or both of them.  Arnold does a good job in this one, having more personality than his previous movie End of Days and is somewhat more intelligent rather than get a gun and start blowing things up, he builds homemade bombs and uses himself as a decoy.The special effects are the best i've ever seen in a movie, and the music beats great with the action.

It is somewhat reminiscent of ""Total Recall"" with its futuristic sci-fi bent and guess-the-identity plot, but it is better because it broaches some interesting ethical considerations regarding human cloning.  Of course, this IS an Arnold movie so it doesn't bother to weigh itself down with profundities, but it adds a little intellectual meat to his stock in trade, and that is a plus.  The script is a bit predictable with numerous tip-offs as to which is the real Adam Gibson and which is the clone.  However, there are enough interesting subplots to keep the viewer engaged.Director Roger Spottiswoode (""Air America"", ""Tomorrow Never Dies"") strikes a good balance between drama and action and paces the film well.  Arnold fans might find the action sequences a bit tame by comparison to some of his other films, but there is plenty to keep the average action junkie happy.The cast is generally solid.  Arnold is the same old Arnold, flexing his biceps and constantly flashing his well-spaced front teeth charmingly between action sequences.  His acting in this film is better than usual, giving his character both strength and vulnerability with a hint of tongue in cheek humor thrown in.  Michael Rapaport provides most of the comic relief in his bits with the virtual girlfriend.  Tony Goldwyn is hatefully nefarious as the manipulative magnate who runs a rogue cloning factory.  Robert Duvall is excellent, as always, as the scientist with a conscience.Overall, this is an entertaining film with an interesting premise.  I rated it a 7/10.

But this film goes along with many films with Schwarzenegger that are dealing with the future. We of course think at once of Terminator. But it also deals with another theme that is popular with him: the use of technology and science to enslave humanity, I mean true real human beings. At times this ""technology and science"" is coming from outer space like in Predator. In this case, like in Total Recall or The Running Man it is coming from humans themselves. In this case it goes slightly further than in other cases. We are not speaking of robots, of the misuse of television and so on, but we are speaking of cloning. What happens when the inventor of a new technology that enables the cloning of a man in twenty minutes, including his mind, memories, etc by the recording of all that via an eye scanner, is using the technology to reproduce himself and his associates? What happens if that inventor is able to inject into each clone a fatal disease that limits his life span to five years maximum, and only the very few at the heart of the plot would be free of that fatal gene or could be cloned again without it? The story of course does not answer these questions really because Adam Gibson (a good old name for the one who will regenerate the creation of God, the creation of the first Adam on the sixth day of his work) self-appoints himself as the one who is going to clean up the plate and he does. The details are in the film. The film adds on this plate the fact that Adam Gibson had been by mistake cloned and then two Adam Gibsons have to cooperate and to survive together, a good lesson of humanity for which the family is the inalienable unit that any man in this family has to defend. Slightly man-centered, but that is no real accident. The man portrayed here is slightly old-fashioned. That's why he is against cloning and that's why he is a slight but gallant male chauvinist.

Most science-fiction uses it as a weak plot device (Alien: Resurrection) or just kind of throws it into the story as a sidenote (Judge Dredd).  And so far, there hasn't really been a good movie---science-fiction or otherwise---that deals with cloning on a deep level.""The 6th Day"" starts out great.  Even after the first car chase, the movie still fools you into thinking it might actually do something with cloning other than degenerate into a cheap action movie with bad acting.  Even the presence of Arnie isn't enough to detract you; the movie provides some innovative uses of cloning to create a story and constructs a believable world for the future.The synchording (spelling?) devices that are introduced sufficiently explain how a clone could have the memories of its source.  This is great---most movies just assume that cloning means you take a strand of DNA, pop it in a machine, and come out with an exact replica of whoever donated the DNA.  ""The 6th Day"" initially respects our intelligence by providing us with a good, albeit fictional and far-fetched, system by which clones can be created.And when the Evil Corporation Cliche comes around and we see how cloning functions as a service it provides, the whole affair is intriguing.  It raises some interesting philosophical questions and moral dilemmas.  Should cloning be banned or regulated?  How could cloning affect the economy, or politics?  What rights should a clone have?But then we hit the forty minute mark in the movie, and the screenwriters go, ""Ha!""  It was a trick.  Duh---the movie stars Arnold friggin' Schwarzenegger!  Of course it's not going to be intellectually deep or satisfying.So then the movie just turns into an all-out action movie, with a lot of lame one-liners and boring shoot-outs and chases.  The Evil Corporation just becomes more cliched and Arnie just seems to get dumber.It's all very boring up until the very end of the movie.  Then, Arnie finally meets Evil CEO Cliche, and there's a scene which is actually very engaging.  Unfortunately, it's clumsily handled and comes off as more annoying than anything else.You see, during this scene, Arnie demands an explanation from the Evil CEO about why he is making clones to begin with.  And what happens?  The Evil CEO delivers a speech that is logical, well-explained, well-rationalized, and appealing.  He actually gives a lot of reasons why cloning is a pretty useful thing and why we should be able to do it.In fact, that's what his character is like all throughout the movie; anytime somebody expresses doubt about cloning, he'll explain a reason why we should embrace it. ""The world was starving until we cloned a bunch of fish, and now everyone can eat."" Or, ""We can now clone organs for surgery instead of waiting for healthy people to die.""  Or, ""We can step around death and we don't have to lose important leaders.""  Good arguments.  If the Evil CEO didn't spend the rest of the time doing stereotypical Evil CEO things (like murder) then he would be the most likeable character in the whole movie.So, what's Arnie's response to the actually-pretty-convincing speech?  ""What about God?"" he says. And then he proceeds to blow up everything and the movie ends.It's pretty lame.  It's not that theological implications aren't important to an issue like cloning, it's just that you can't simplify a complicated moral issue like this.In the end, ""The 6th Day"" tried to balance a brainy script with Arnie-fueled action, and it didn't work.  So instead of trying to make a movie that actually explored all of the ramifications and possible uses or misuses of cloning, they just made a subpar adventure.I give it two stars for at least trying.

Was ""6th Day"" cloned from stuff ""Total Recall"" left on the cutting room floor? Well, aside from the always-appealing plot theme of ""who am I, really"" which is also in  ""Total Recall"", I have to say, no, this is a good, mostly original and enjoyable science fiction thriller.And thrilling it certainly was. Though some of the thematic material is somewhat derivative if you are a sci-fi buff, this movie delivers a goodly amount of suspense and turn-around surprises. It isn't the smartest plot in the DVD deck; I found some of the scenes predictable and there was one deplorable and totally gratuitous car chase early in the film. (Grrrrr I hate gratuitous car chases.)  And later on, there is a Matrix-cloned scene involving another type of transportation, but I won't put ANY spoilers in here and tell you about it. But it's why I nicked this a star and rated it four and not five.However, if you can shut an eye to the vehicular filmicide, you may enjoy a reasonably fast-paced, very suspenseful film with a good supporting cast, too.Schwarzenegger has been quoted as saying he believes in delivering plenty of good entertainment value for the filmgoer's dollar, as in ""Terminator 2"" --a big favorite.

I didn't see any point of putting that thing going on in the football field. That was totaly pointless. It had no connection wih the movie really. If I were able to edit parts out, I would definitely remove that one. I can remember the last time I watched this I also watched Commando on the same day. That was good, but not great. The only acton movie he made I really ddn't like was Eraser. I don't think I'll ever be watching that again. This was an excellent story though. The real characer never really got in any danger. I thoguht it was strange how they had you thinking the clone was the real character and the real guy was the duplicate. I kinda could figure that out that the one going around tryin to figure everything out had to be the clone. The one they were trying to make you think was thedplicate just seemed too normal to be a fake. I do liek it that in this duplicate story the two got along when they found out about eachother. Most duplicate stories the real guy and cone become enemies and try to take out the other. Like knocking the real gu out, trapping him in somewhere, then the duplicate goes outliving the real guy's life. This story doesn't do that. They find eachoter and actully help eachother out with their problems. The real charcter is able to get past all the security systems when going to rescue his family from the baddies cause he had the duplicate destroy all the cameras.

As he returns from work on his birthday he finds his family celebrating with a clone of his (unaware) and he wants to find out who's responsible at any costs.CAST: Well what can we say about Anie? Has he ever been convincing? Did we ever not laugh because of that charming Austrian accent of his. But he manages to give at least some credibility to his character. The supporting cast however is excellent. One has to mention Robert Duvall whose acting brings a lot of intensity to the film.SCRIPT: This is somewhat of an intelligent Action film because it opens a lot of questions about cloning and offers a great deal of hilarious black humor. Although the pointy finger and the family aspect seems a bit forced it is an exciting story with many different aspects to it.DIRECTION: Well here is the films major problem. Roger Spottiswood, whose Bond adventure &quot;Tomorrow never dies&quot; I didn't like very much opens the movie with a Football Game where he copies shots from Oliver Stone's &quot;Any given Sunday&quot;. The action sequences in general are rather badly shot. The pace seems too slow and the fast editing confuses more than it creates tempo. There is some skip-framing which works pretty well but besides that the direction is really kind of clumsy and lacks originality and speed. Which is pretty tragic for an acionthriller.THE DVD: Since the film didn't gross very much, the DVD isn't filled with special features. There are some infomercials which are funny to look at but.. hey, that's not very interesting, is it? And then therte's the isolated score with commentary by composer Trevor Rabin. I do own the score CD and I absolutely adore it but Trevor talks during the cues and not only between them so you cannot really enjoy the music.ALL IN ALL: an entertaining Thriller, with great plot but average action sequences.

Oh well, what a shame.I wasn't particularly fussed about watching this film, and as it turns out, I've seen it before - in every other film that Arnie has ever done. So no change with this film. I dunno whether he can't be bothered reading the scripts or what, but he seems to have got himself stereotyped as the same character. Or maybe he can only play one character. Hmmmmm!The issue of cloning has becoming more and more realistic, since Dolly the sheep, and now they're cloning human cells or something to cut out disease. It's something like that. Or is it human parts they're cloning? Whatever. It has a lot of similarities to Total Recall, which wasn't that terrific. But it's an Arnie movie, he can do wrong in some people's eyes.I liked most of the characters in this, including Arnie's character, although he seems to take the p*ss out of some of his previous incarnations. Also included amongst the cast are Michael Rapaport (he played one of Phoebe's boyfriends in Friends - Gary the cop), and also Tony Goldwyn (the semi-bad guy in Ghost). I found Tony's character very hard to understand, as he seemed like he really wasn't that great big a part of the movie, along with Robert Duvall's character. Both could have been cut out of the movie, and we wouldn't have missed them.There are a few funny scenes in this. Arnie & Arnie are hilarious together (although you can see from the back that they aren't the same person obviously!), and Sim Pal Cindy was just creepy! Especially when she's got a big hole in her chest, and STILL she talks!There are a few daft bits too, some small bits that obviously the bigwigs missed. Arnie has a razor cut when he gets cloned and Michael Rapaport's character uses this to identify him as the uncloned. Later on, we find they can reproduce this tiny little cut. So why exactly does the bad girl have to repierce her ears every time she gets cloned?Some of the action sequences in this are pretty dire, particularly the helicopter scene - guys, you can see the white lines!For Arnie fans, you'll probably enjoy this movie, although I thought he looked really old during a few scenes - he's getting on a bit for these action roles now. If you've seen Blade Runner or Total Recall (and there's probably a few other films that touch on the same subject), then you'll probably not really enjoy this movie.The best bit of the whole movie?

After figuring out that the cloning was a mistake, Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn) sends out assassins to capture Gibson.  But now there are two Arnold's.  Each one believes that they are in fact Adam Gibson.  Now, after (their) family has been kidnapped, Gibson and his clone join forces to save (their) wife and daughter and save the world from an illegal cloning facility!MY REVIEW:&quot;This movie isn't the best film from the SCHWARZENEGGER collection, but it is definetly worth seeing!  Double SCHWARZENEGGER means a big action blockbuster!  What was really interestingly cool about the film was it's realistic depiction of the future world- from being able to order milk over your refridgerator, to hollogram girlfriends!  SCHWARZENEGGER's performance was very good this time around!  He IS really an actor, showing in the past that his best performance is a cyborg from the future.  Well, SCHWARZENEGGER is a caring, loving and simple- average husband and father.  He's no John Matrix like in Commando or super-spy like in True Lies, he's realistic now (considering the storyline).  The weapons in this film were the only things in this film that didn't seem real.  LASERS???  Come on, that is really pushing it for 8 1/2 years.  But overall, this film is fun, action loaded, funny, romantic and is a big twist a minute thriller that is fun to watch.

Canadian-born Spottiswoode broke onto the scene in 1980 with one of my all-time favorite horror flicks: Terror Train.  Since then he's directed many solid, but average flicks like Shoot To Kill, Turner & Hooch and Air America (to name a few).  He does a great job here mixing action, special effects, a loaded cast, and not just one Arnold...but TWO Arnolds!  He definitely took some cues from Paul Verhoeven with the futuristic commercials, and 3-d ads sprinkled throughout these 123 minutes.  Fans of Robocop, Starship Troopers and more specifically Total Recall should certainly not be disappointed.He has a lot to work with as the cast is filled with very solid actors.  Michael Rapaport (True Romance), Tony Goldwyn (The Pelican Brief), Michael Rooker (Days Of Thunder) and Robert Duvall (too many flicks to pick one-a Hollywood LEGEND) all play key roles.  I don't even need to mention Arnold as his resume is well known (read: provides great action, but his delivery...), plus, there's TWO Arnolds to contend with here as he's been illegally cloned (some scenes kinda remind me of Marty McFly's in BTTF2).The story is about the philosophical ramifications of cloning.  How it affects ourselves, the ones we love, and the ones we don't even know.  It's played from both angles; one, the tender angle to keep the ones we love (and ourselves) alive for as long as we can, and the other angle of deceit and manipulation as forced upon us by government, corporations, etc.  This makes for an interesting debate issue (albeit, not a new one), and since the movie debuted in 2000, the cloning issue has somewhat dissipated.There's a whole second disc of extras and this is really a great-looking, great-sounding overall package.  9 featurettes, Showtime special, storyboard comparisons and animatics, RePet infomercials & TV spot, trailers, filmographies, and a nice DVD-ROM section.In short, if you like futuristic sci-fi and action flicks and can handle two Arnolds (much better than handling two Van Dammes!) then this one's highly recommended for a rental and if you find it cheap:  definitely pick it up for purchase.",4,IF YOU LIKE ARNOLD AND PAUL VERHOEVEN FLICKS...YOU'LL DIG THIS ONE,1167004800,"12 25, 2006",2006,2510,"['MOVIE', '***1/2EXTRAS', 'BUMP', 'OVERALL', 'RATING', 'UP', 'TO', '****This', '2-disc', 'set', 'Roger', 'Spottiswoode-directed', 'sci-fi/action', 'flick', 'THE', '6TH', 'DAY', 'lame', 'original', 'bare-bones', 'edition.Arnold', 'pretty', 'bad', 'rap', 'nowadays', 'what', ""n't"", '80', 'pretty', 'good', 'flick', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'directed', 'nicely', 'Roger', 'Spottiswoode', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'Tomorrow', 'Never', 'Dies', 'Canadian-born', 'Spottiswoode', 'broke', 'scene', '1980', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'horror', 'flicks', 'Terror', 'Train', 'then', 'directed', 'many', 'solid', 'average', 'flicks', 'Shoot', 'Kill', 'Turner', 'Hooch', 'Air', 'America', 'name', 'few', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'mixing', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'loaded', 'cast', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'Arnold', 'TWO', 'Arnolds', 'definitely', 'took', 'cues', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'futuristic', 'commercials', '3-d', 'ads', 'sprinkled', '123', 'minutes', 'Fans', 'Robocop', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'more', 'specifically', 'Total', 'Recall', 'should', 'certainly', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed.He', 'lot', 'work', 'cast', 'filled', 'very', 'solid', 'actors', 'Michael', 'Rapaport', 'True', 'Romance', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'Pelican', 'Brief', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'Days', 'Thunder', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'too', 'many', 'flicks', 'pick', 'one-a', 'Hollywood', 'LEGEND', 'play', 'key', 'roles', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'mention', 'Arnold', 'resume', 'well', 'known', 'read', 'great', 'action', 'delivery', 'TWO', 'Arnolds', 'contend', 'here', 'been', 'illegally', 'cloned', 'scenes', 'kinda', 'Marty', 'McFly', 'BTTF2', '.The', 'story', 'philosophical', 'ramifications', 'cloning', 'How', 'ones', 'love', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'played', 'angles', 'one', 'tender', 'angle', 'keep', 'ones', 'love', 'alive', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'other', 'angle', 'deceit', 'manipulation', 'forced', 'government', 'corporations', 'etc', 'interesting', 'debate', 'issue', 'albeit', 'not', 'new', 'one', 'movie', 'debuted', '2000', 'cloning', 'issue', 'somewhat', 'whole', 'second', 'disc', 'extras', 'really', 'great-looking', 'great-sounding', 'overall', 'package', '9', 'featurettes', 'Showtime', 'special', 'storyboard', 'comparisons', 'animatics', 'RePet', 'infomercials', 'TV', 'spot', 'trailers', 'filmographies', 'nice', 'DVD-ROM', 'section.In', 'short', 'like', 'futuristic', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'flicks', 'can', 'handle', 'two', 'Arnolds', 'much', 'better', 'handling', 'two', 'Van', 'Dammes', 'then', 'one', 'highly', 'recommended', 'rental', 'find', 'cheap', 'definitely', 'up', 'purchase']",N/A

570310,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000056PMU,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","Pity poor Arnold Schwarzenegger - it seems like every time he makes a movie lately some writer goes ahead and implants a plot device that ends up making the film seem irrelevant and obsolete a mere six months after its release.  In 1999's ""End of Days,"" the premise involved the return of Satan on midnight, New Years Day 2000.  Now in ""The 6th Day,"" set some time in the near future, the movie opens up with a scene set at a game of the (now defunct) XFL.  Luckily for Arnold, this gaffe plays only a minor part in the overall proceedings.Actually, taken as a whole, ""The 6th Day"" stands as one of the better sci-fi action flicks of the past several years.  In both plot and style, it strikes echoes of ""Total Recall,"" not a bad choice for imitation really since that was clearly one of Arnold's all time better vehicles.  Like ""Recall,"" ""The 6th Day"" is set in a future world where technology has begun to run amuck but which still shares enough of the basic values of our time to allow us to relate to the characters.  Also, in ""Recall,"" we were never quite sure if Arnold's character were really living out all the wild experiences of which he seemed to be a part, or whether he was merely dreaming it all as part of a virtual reality ""vacation"" courtesy of a high tech brain implant.  In ""The 6th Day,"" we are never quite sure whether Adam Gibson is a man struggling to reassert his place which seems to have been usurped by a clone - or whether the Adam we know and are following is actually the clone himself.Credit Cormac and Marianne Wibberley for composing a screenplay that is dense, clever and, for the most part, comprehensible and Roger Spottiswoode for keeping the action percolating along at a very fast clip.  As with most of these movies, the first two thirds is the most impressive, as the details of the mind-bending plot reveal themselves one by one.  We really have to think while watching this movie, not only about who is who or about what is real and what is fake, but also about some of the finer ethical issues that arise when science and technology seem to be outpacing mankind's moral ability to keep up with it all.  It's not too often that we are asked to engage our brains in the context of an action film, so we'll take our pleasures where we can find them.  For, alas, when all is said and done, ""The 6th Day"" is, after all, an action film, which explains the inevitable tendency for it to falter in its last third as ideas are replaced by hardware and as the ""villains"" fall into their predictable behavior patterns.  Rest assured, once the guns start blazing, ""The 6th Day"" can't help but lose our interest.  The film is also, unfortunately, saddled with Arnold himself who, although he can still pull off the action scenes well enough, simply cannot deliver on the many ""emotional"" moments that come his way in this film.Yet, why quibble when ""The 6th Day"" provides so much more food for thought than we are used to on a menu such as this one?

570314,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B000056PMU,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[1, 4]","The 6th Day tries to clone the style of several Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. The film copies some setting elements of the contemporary Jingle All the Way and True Lies and replicates Total Recall's near futuristic storyline. Unfortunately, like a real clone, this film looks the same on the outside but lacks the personality. warmth, and depth of any of the original films.The plot about a man being illegally cloned to cover up the death of an executive just doesn't work. Ironically the 6th Day comes off like a PC clone of Paul Verhoven's ultra violent superior 1990 film Total Recall. That film's plot centers on the mystery of whether or not Schwarzenegger character's memories are real or not. The 6th Day Poses a similar question asking the audience to question is Schwarzenegger a clone or not. Unfortunately, We get cheated out of what could have been an interesting mystery because this film answers that question by the half-hour mark. With the main question of the mystery answered, the whole film falls flat and turns into a Scene for scene cleaned up PC version of Total Recall set in the bland, boring suburb where Jingle All the Way happened. Watching the 6th Day I found myself missing Total Recall; that film's violence had a purpose in the plot and gave the film a dark, gritty feel of life in the big city in the near future. Best of all, the violence forced the futuristic details to blend into the backgrounds. In this violence-free film the futuristic details stick out like a bunch of pink flamingoes. The details such as Arnold's jetcopter, RePets to a simdoll and a reference to the defunct XFL, and quarterbacks earning $300 million, don't blend in the background to give us a picture of life in the era; they come to the forefront and get in the way of the story and characters. The characters themselves come off too bland and boring, to stand out because they don't have a personalities of their own like Total Recall's gritty and sleazy characters. I barely learned anything about Arnold Schwarzenegger character outside of him being a pilot and a loving family man.Speaking of characters, this film ""clones"" Total Recall's villains too. Unfortunately, the actors don't give great performances like Michael Ironside, Sharon Stone, and Ronny Cox did. That's because this film forgets to ""clone"" Total Recall's villains story, personality or depth. I couldn't hate them or care about them because I never got to know them. They had no personality or story to follow The only purpose of the villains in this film is to chase after Schwarzenegger in the PC, bloodless, watered down action sequences and shoot at him because the big boss told them to. And the big boss comes off like a used car salesman instead of an evil exec. I don't feel any sense of menace or danger from any of the villains; that made a lot of the action scenes in the final act come off as tedious.After watching this bland film I quickly forgot about it ten minutes after watching it. I guess that's why it was the box office bomb that started Arnold Schwarzenegger slow road downhill. There was nothing memorable about the 6th Day for people to recommend it to friends. It just came off like a generic action movie. For an unforgettable real near future experience full of action and adventure, buy Paul Verhoven's Total Recall or Robocop. Those movies are well worth the price of purchase.",1,A clone of Total Recall.

This movie provided most of the Arnoldlocity we have come to expect -- action, humor, fantastic special effects, etc.  Arnold plays the same role he always plays: All-American Austrian Guy.  He stands for everything we would like to think of ourselves as being, underneath all the layers of fat and tension that is contemporary culture.The special effects in this movie are smart and a lot of fun to watch.  The way the movie uses camera effects to conceal and then tell the story is very cool.  And the movie (naturally) sets up its own sequel, but I won't tell you how.  The biggest reservation I have is that it didn't really stress me out as much, as in T2.  There's a preposterous chase scene at the beginning, for example, that, for all its attempt at glory, just fails to engage me with that panic and wonder that chase scenes are supposed to generate.  I think this because it is so over the top; you can practically count how many red Caddilacs they had to destroy to make it.  Of course it may be that chase scenes reached their climax way back in the 70s with the greatest of all time in The French Connection.  But it's not so long that I ended up tapping my fingers.  Also the ending is mildly sluggish and not as cool and nailbitingly relentless as the ending to T2 or T1 for that matter, but what is? Nevertheless, these are small qualms because this movie is one big shiny bag of eye candy from start to finish, and the pace is quick, so I never had to worry too much about one thing because I was already way on to the next thing.  (Only action movie fans will know what I mean here.)The DVD is pretty good, though it doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles.  The digital surround sound is excellent and the picture is crisp and widescreen big.

Enough reviewers have provided summaries and evaluations of acting and plot line so this review, and its stars, is based only upon the quality of the Blu Ray transfer itself.VIDEO....For the film's age, the transfer is pretty decent.  While I did not see a massive difference between the Standard Def DVD and this Blu Ray, I did note that the blacks were deep and true and color grading was fairly natural throughout the film.  The focus in spots seemed to be a touch soft to me with a loss of small details but this was not a hyper noticeable thing.  At no point did I observe noticeable grain or distracting artifacts.  I do believe that this Blu Ray was made from a good master, but do not think that it was remastered for Blu Ray.  All in all, a good video transfer.AUDIO....The lossless DTS MA HD 5.1 audio is a markedly improved soundtrack with clear and distinct dialogue.  As clear as you will get Arnold's accent at any rate.  The audio track uses plenty of the LFE channel, but don't count on a truly deep bass note.  Foley fx are well distributed to the front and rear surrounds with some nice panning between both sound stages.  Many of the foley audio fx sounded as if they were muxed into the surround channels instead of being discretely directed to a specific channel.  At the same time, there was some directionality with quite a few foley fx.Extras...Many extras on this Blu Ray and I can't say I have watched them as yet.  However, they all seem to be the same ones that were on the Standard Definition release.The film does have that 80's Arnold era feel to it but it retains its entertainment value.  If you already have the SD release on DVD I do not believe that the Blu Ray will be a night and day difference for you. That said, improvement in contrast and darker areas are well noted.I do hope that this type of review focusing only upon the BR's quality has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase.
