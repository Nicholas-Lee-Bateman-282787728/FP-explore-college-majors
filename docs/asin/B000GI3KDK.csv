It was a MUST HAVE addition to my DVD library.But I happen to be one of millions who is hearing impaired, and I also have some problems with English spoken in many international dialects. So...WHY WHY WHY did they release the first 4 seasons with English subtitle captions, for the enjoyment of people like me with admitted hearing loss, and then release Season 5 with NO English subtitles??????????????????????? YES, VERY FRUSTRATING. I happen to know the subtitles track you can switch on or off, is nothing more than a text files with a timing script, only adds a few kilobytes to the DVD, and would add a very minimal cost to the overall production budget. To those who NEED this feature to enjoy a video, it is PRICELESS!If anyone in any production capacity can read this, PLEASE be sure your product features subs for those who need them. Amazon incorrectly claimed this set had them. Seasons 1 thru 4 do have them. I want to dump the whole set! (It DOES have subs in French and Spanish, guess I will have to learn a new language to get subtitles)",2,Why no English subtitles???,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,1235,"['First', 'LOVE', 'series', 'well', 'written', 'great', 'characters', 'many', 'unique', 'creative', 'aspects', 'business', 'espionage', 'cover-ups', 'issues', 'trust', 'loyalty', 'survival', 'was', 'MUST', 'HAVE', 'addition', 'DVD', 'library.But', 'happen', 'be', 'one', 'millions', 'who', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'also', 'have', 'problems', 'English', 'spoken', 'many', 'international', 'dialects', 'So', 'WHY', 'WHY', 'WHY', 'did', 'release', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'English', 'subtitle', 'captions', 'enjoyment', 'people', 'admitted', 'hearing', 'loss', 'then', 'release', 'Season', '5', 'English', 'subtitles', 'YES', 'VERY', 'FRUSTRATING', 'happen', 'know', 'subtitles', 'track', 'can', 'switch', 'nothing', 'more', 'text', 'files', 'timing', 'script', 'only', 'few', 'kilobytes', 'DVD', 'would', 'add', 'very', 'minimal', 'cost', 'overall', 'production', 'budget', 'who', 'NEED', 'feature', 'enjoy', 'video', 'PRICELESS', 'anyone', 'production', 'capacity', 'can', 'read', 'PLEASE', 'be', 'sure', 'product', 'features', 'subs', 'who', 'need', 'Amazon', 'incorrectly', 'claimed', 'set', 'had', 'Seasons', '1', 'thru', '4', 'do', 'have', 'want', 'dump', 'whole', 'set', 'DOES', 'have', 'subs', 'French', 'Spanish', 'guess', 'will', 'have', 'learn', 'new', 'language', 'get', 'subtitles']",La Femme Nikita: Season 5

1004356,A1X9OJN30EBE3M,B000GI3KDK,Dr. Karl O. Edwards,"[1, 1]","Since Amazon has lost my review of this DVD set, I am resubmitting my original review, as written on March 13, 2008:While not as gripping as the last half of Season Four or Season One, the producers and writers take the viewer on a wonderful ride into the land of POWER. With twists and turns that were intriguing, the rather subliminal truth of interactions and relationships found in the first four seasons, is now the core of this ""second"" ending of Le Femme Nikita.As I never watched the show on television, I am unable to really say if the Fifth Season provides what fans at the time wanted or not. However, I do think that further episodes were needed. For me, Season Five ended just as things were getting even more interesting, and, as such, is yet another example of how Warner Brothers (WB) really does not care about their viewers. While they may have ""provided"" these eight episodes, if WB was really listening they would have ensured the show went on.Lastly, I would like to comment on DVDs by Warner Brothers: they are long on promise of special features, formate, etc., but short on delivering. AND why is there not a single commentary on any episode in the five years by Peta Wilson?ADDITIONAL COMMENTS November 2, 2008: Many of the people involved with ""La Femme Nikita"" have gone on to work on the immensely better show, ""24.""  However, ""La Femme Nikita"" gives a glance into the underpinnings of the concepts and directions ""24"" has taken, and as such remains a powerful show in its own right.  I cannot say enough about ""La Femme Nikita"" beyond the words I have written in my reviews, and to say it is a show that is tremendously entertaining, dramatic, engrossing, and, to borrow a phrase, ""must watch tv.""",5,"IN THE END, IT IS ALL ABOUT POWER",1225497600,"11 1, 2008",2008,1726,"['Amazon', 'lost', 'review', 'DVD', 'set', 'am', 'resubmitting', 'original', 'review', 'written', 'March', '13', '2008', 'not', 'as', 'gripping', 'last', 'half', 'Season', 'Four', 'Season', 'One', 'producers', 'writers', 'take', 'viewer', 'wonderful', 'ride', 'land', 'POWER', 'twists', 'turns', 'were', 'intriguing', 'rather', 'subliminal', 'truth', 'interactions', 'relationships', 'found', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'now', 'core', 'second', 'ending', 'Le', 'Femme', 'Nikita.As', 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'television', 'am', 'unable', 'really', 'say', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'what', 'fans', 'time', 'wanted', 'not', 'However', 'do', 'think', 'further', 'episodes', 'were', 'needed', 'Season', 'Five', 'ended', 'just', 'things', 'were', 'getting', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'such', 'yet', 'example', 'how', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'WB', 'really', 'not', 'care', 'viewers', 'may', 'have', 'provided', 'eight', 'episodes', 'WB', 'was', 'really', 'listening', 'would', 'have', 'ensured', 'show', 'went', 'on.Lastly', 'would', 'like', 'comment', 'DVDs', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'are', 'long', 'promise', 'special', 'features', 'formate', 'etc.', 'short', 'delivering', 'why', 'there', 'not', 'single', 'commentary', 'episode', 'five', 'years', 'Peta', 'Wilson', 'ADDITIONAL', 'COMMENTS', 'November', '2', '2008', 'Many', 'people', 'involved', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'have', 'gone', 'work', 'immensely', 'better', 'show', '24', 'However', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'glance', 'underpinnings', 'concepts', 'directions', '24', 'taken', 'such', 'powerful', 'show', 'own', 'right', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'words', 'have', 'written', 'reviews', 'say', 'show', 'tremendously', 'entertaining', 'dramatic', 'engrossing', 'borrow', 'phrase', 'must', 'watch', 'tv']",La Femme Nikita: Season 5

Honestly, I was a bit confused during these last 8 episodes, but in the end I was happy to have some answers and conclusions some revelations and even more Michael and Nikita (yum!). While I'm a sucker for happy endings, I knew none could really be had in Section, so these episodes stayed true to the show.  The price could be a little cheaper for only 8 episodes, but with other seasons priced at $60 + what can I expect? I still don't know why they're so expensive. If you're patient (and cheap or poor) wait for a sale, I did.  This is a great series, with wonderful character development. The show, sadly, never really got off the ground floor. Still, devoted LFN fans cheered the show to 5 seasons. I think without even re-runs being showns, you have to buy it on DVD now to get your fix unless you taped all the eps.  While S5 does tie up things and give a more satisfying ending, you can actually get away with only buying season 1-4 and be happy.  But the whole collection is for any real fan.

I also have purchased the new Nikita series in BD so it's a little difficult to give an unbiased review after watching the new Nikita so I won't.All I want to know is if the Fifth Season of La Femme Nikita has a Confidential Information Insert.  Seasons 1,2,3, and 4 have a confidential pamphlet which gives more detail to each of the episodes.  The fifth season did not have one included; or the one I received did not.  I wish it did as the confidential Information gives a lot of added details such as the name of the writer, director, and original airdate, along with a synopsis of each episode and information about the cancelled scenes.  This is one of the nicer inserts that I have seen and I would repurchase the fifth season if I could be sure that it includes the confidential information.To conclude this non review, LFN is a four and a half year roller coaster ride with excitement and intrigue around every bend, dip, and corner.

It tied up the loose ends but left a few open.  I cant stand perfectly closed & happy endings.  And not having Michael in every episode was a nice break where we were able to explore the different layers of her whole story. Not just her relationship with Michael.  We have shared all her woes, triumphs & personal/professional development and to see that each step of her journey leads her to her destiny, was fulfilling to say the least.  I have heard a few philosophies that a great leader (or a balanced leader) is one who is reluctant to take on the job.The look and feel of Series 5 seems more substantial and different from the rest of them.  Many of the episodes on season 1, are still my favourite though.They should have left in the deleted 'drink' scene between Walter & Operations, because Walter actually gets to the heart of Nikita's & Operations relationship. It just sums it up nicely where as without it you feel something is missing.Also with the some what of an open ending you know Nikita has her work cut out for her & that the odds are against what she wants to achieve.
