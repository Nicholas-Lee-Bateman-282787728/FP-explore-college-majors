I first saw him as Preston in ""Wives and Daughters"" and was impressed by his brooding depth. He's perfect as the obsessive-compulsive, sadistic priest. I can't imagine him ever giving a bad performance. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent.Never once did my engagement flag, which indicates something went very right with the script and the editing. Only the magenta colored flash-back sequences, which seemed both incongruous and conventional, made me roll my eyes.

1047136,A1TVILUSPJTOS3,B000MMLO2O,Mr. B,"[1, 1]","This film is an unfortunate accurate depiction of the terrible abuse perpetrated on children in Catholic, youth institutions for over 75 years.  Only recently, has the tide turned in bringing to light this tragic history of the thousands of victims.  Two things are significant to me, the first is the lay teacher (a veteran of the Spanish Civil War and poet)who became a champion and defender of his students.  As a former educator, I was impressed with his success with his most challenging students.  The culture of mutual support was incredible.  The way the other students congratulated each others successes was proof of the classroom culture that he developed. We have been encourage to ""individualize"" learning for our students.  He was a master of that in the early 40ies!The saddest part of this movie was not the unforgivable rape of one student, the vicious physical abuse of others, and even the murder of one.  It was the way that the Church dealt with the criminal sadistic priest/brother.  He was sent to Africa and not to jail.  And from what I know of the African missions at that time, I dread to even think of how many more victims that he had before he died. The Church today cannot do enough to rectify and to acknowledge this sordid history.  It still remains to see if the patriarchal hierarchy will do what is right.",5,All too tragically true!,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,1341,"['film', 'unfortunate', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'terrible', 'abuse', 'perpetrated', 'children', 'Catholic', 'youth', 'institutions', '75', 'years', 'Only', 'recently', 'tide', 'turned', 'bringing', 'light', 'tragic', 'history', 'thousands', 'victims', 'Two', 'things', 'are', 'significant', 'first', 'lay', 'teacher', 'veteran', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', 'poet', 'who', 'became', 'champion', 'defender', 'students', 'former', 'educator', 'was', 'impressed', 'success', 'most', 'challenging', 'students', 'culture', 'mutual', 'support', 'was', 'incredible', 'way', 'other', 'students', 'congratulated', 'others', 'successes', 'was', 'proof', 'classroom', 'culture', 'developed', 'have', 'been', 'encourage', 'individualize', 'learning', 'students', 'was', 'master', 'early', '40ies', 'saddest', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'unforgivable', 'rape', 'one', 'student', 'vicious', 'physical', 'abuse', 'others', 'even', 'murder', 'one', 'was', 'way', 'Church', 'dealt', 'criminal', 'sadistic', 'priest/brother', 'was', 'sent', 'Africa', 'not', 'jail', 'what', 'know', 'African', 'missions', 'time', 'dread', 'even', 'think', 'how', 'many', 'more', 'victims', 'had', 'died', 'Church', 'today', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'enough', 'rectify', 'acknowledge', 'sordid', 'history', 'still', 'see', 'patriarchal', 'hierarchy', 'will', 'do', 'what', 'right']",N/A
1047137,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,B000MMLO2O,PJR,"[1, 1]","Terrific and brave film. Goes alongside the powerful Boys of St. Vincents and the Magdalene sisters that also deal with child abuse in Catholic orphanages and reformatories and disgusting coverups. The acting is very good and the photography and editing all work well.The motives of the primary abusive character seem pretty clear. He is a screwed up person who finds a perfect niche in clerical garb where he can hide his true character behind what might appear to the world as a virtuous drive to fight evil. This is a very old, old story. When will we ever learn?!!!!! There was the Inquisition and various purges of so called heretics and endless scandals in church run orphanages etc. Today we have plenty of scandals in all religions.The film shows some of the dynamics of how the institution tends to protect and cover up and this protection of the interests of the reputation and power of institutions of course also helps to offer cover to dysfunctional people. This film focuses on a Catholic institution as most of the other films mentioned do as well. See also Bunuel's film El. I really don't think the point is just about Catholicism, however. It is about unaccountability and how using the name of God can be a cheap way to get power over others -- or it might be using a flag, or any other emotional front. This is the broader lesson. Sanctimony is not just a problem among Catholics or Christians broadly speaking.In the background there are allusions to the Spanish Civil War. The sadistic character was not simply sadistic. He was even more very authoritarian. It was difficult to not make a connection between this authoritarian individual and his followers and the fascists in Spain and then Germany. The film just about rubs your face in in and I am surprised that none of the other reviewers develop this aspect of the film. I think it is an important aspect of the film. Passing him off as simply sadistic misses much of what the film has to say. I think one could argue that there is very little sadism per se in the film although there is enormous brutality. Sadism is there and there is a bit of sexual abuse but I would argue that the authoritarian theme is stronger and perhaps should be more disturbing.",5,terrific but tough watching,1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,2233,"['Terrific', 'brave', 'film', 'Goes', 'powerful', 'Boys', 'St.', 'Vincents', 'Magdalene', 'sisters', 'also', 'deal', 'child', 'abuse', 'Catholic', 'orphanages', 'reformatories', 'disgusting', 'coverups', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'photography', 'editing', 'work', 'well.The', 'motives', 'primary', 'abusive', 'character', 'seem', 'pretty', 'clear', 'screwed', 'up', 'person', 'who', 'perfect', 'niche', 'clerical', 'garb', 'where', 'can', 'hide', 'true', 'character', 'what', 'might', 'appear', 'world', 'virtuous', 'drive', 'fight', 'evil', 'very', 'old', 'old', 'story', 'When', 'will', 'ever', 'learn', 'was', 'Inquisition', 'various', 'purges', 'so', 'called', 'heretics', 'endless', 'scandals', 'church', 'run', 'etc', 'Today', 'have', 'plenty', 'scandals', 'religions.The', 'film', 'dynamics', 'how', 'institution', 'protect', 'cover', 'up', 'protection', 'interests', 'reputation', 'power', 'institutions', 'course', 'also', 'offer', 'cover', 'dysfunctional', 'people', 'film', 'Catholic', 'institution', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'mentioned', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'See', 'also', 'Bunuel', 'film', 'El', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'point', 'just', 'Catholicism', 'however', 'unaccountability', 'how', 'using', 'name', 'God', 'can', 'be', 'cheap', 'way', 'get', 'power', 'others', 'might', 'be', 'using', 'flag', 'other', 'emotional', 'front', 'broader', 'lesson', 'Sanctimony', 'not', 'just', 'problem', 'Catholics', 'Christians', 'broadly', 'speaking.In', 'background', 'are', 'allusions', 'Spanish', 'Civil', 'War', 'sadistic', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'simply', 'sadistic', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'very', 'authoritarian', 'was', 'difficult', 'not', 'make', 'connection', 'authoritarian', 'individual', 'followers', 'fascists', 'Spain', 'then', 'Germany', 'film', 'just', 'rubs', 'face', 'am', 'surprised', 'none', 'other', 'reviewers', 'develop', 'aspect', 'film', 'think', 'important', 'aspect', 'film', 'Passing', 'off', 'simply', 'sadistic', 'misses', 'much', 'what', 'film', 'say', 'think', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'very', 'little', 'sadism', 'se', 'film', 'enormous', 'brutality', 'Sadism', 'there', 'bit', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'would', 'argue', 'authoritarian', 'theme', 'stronger', 'perhaps', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'disturbing']",N/A
