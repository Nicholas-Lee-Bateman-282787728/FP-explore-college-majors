1314795,A1UDOU7QLVX9QB,B00304YLMG,Linda J. Barrett,"[36, 38]","Although Mike Dooley's appearance was brief in the Secret DVD, he made a major impression on me. Subsequently, I've become a member of his website ... [...] ... and now receive an email Mon-Fri, called Notes from the Universe and have purchased his books and CDs. With this in mind, I was excited to learn that he had produced his first DVD ... Thoughts Become Things ... and purchased it immediately. I received it yesterday, watched it today with my husband, and was more than happy with the production and message.The thing I really like about Mike Dooley is how down to earth he is ... very real and approachable ... and his message, easy to understand and to apply. The same can be said with this DVD. The production features, Mike, primarily speaking directly to the viewer, along with visual examples (actors) or illustrations of each message (lesson) he's discussing ... all filled with humor, and presented in a self-deprecating, and non-flashy manner. Watch it from start to finish for a complete overview, and after that, watch just the chapter you feel you need a refresher course on, or whenever you need a little lift or nudge in the right direction.This DVD is perfect for the beginner explorer who is discovering the art of creating their own best reality for the first time ... or, for those well versed in the concepts, but who enjoy, or prefer to get their information visually and are always happy to supplement their metaphysical library. I can recommend this DVD highly and have purchased three more DVDs for Christmas gifts for family and friends. I'm sure you'll feel the same way, too.

It is excellent in that it is very direct and clear in its explanations and examples.The main thing I don't like about this video is that it is highly one-sided as far as the audience it is directed to. According the the actors or people in the video, only while, young, and wealthy people should watch this because that is all you see.If the producers really wanted to spread the work and improve people's lives and the world, then they should have more variety in the video.
