I bought this collection to acquire a few of the other non-Charlie Chase ones, even though the Chaplin ones are, again, included on other collections.The images are apparently from 16mm instead of 35mm and are rather fuzzy, but watchable.  The music is the reason I did not give this collection a higher grade.  Don Kinnier has done a good job in creating a creditable score, then he kinda steps in it by using a synthesizer that wasn't invented until decades after these films were first shown.  It is truly distracting to listen to otherwise good accompaniment tarnished by electronic sounds instead of real clarinets, etc.  Even the organ reeks of synthesis.  Originally these films were accompanied by piano, theatre pipe organ, or vaudeville orchestra, and other companies follow this precedent.  Okay, I know it has to stay on a budget, but I for one find it annoying along with the fuzzy prints.Hard to complain about the price, though, a lot of enjoyment for the buck.",3,"Pretty good value, but rather inappropriate musical background",1388275200,"12 29, 2013",2013,1148,"['films', 'mostly', 'are', 'classic', 'Charlie', 'Chase', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'several', 'years', 'old', 'other', 'DVDs', 'have', 'come', 'market', 'many', 'same', 'titles', 'bought', 'collection', 'acquire', 'few', 'other', 'non-Charlie', 'Chase', 'ones', 'even', 'Chaplin', 'ones', 'are', 'again', 'included', 'other', 'collections.The', 'images', 'are', 'apparently', '16mm', 'instead', '35mm', 'are', 'rather', 'fuzzy', 'watchable', 'music', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'collection', 'higher', 'grade', 'Don', 'Kinnier', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'creating', 'creditable', 'score', 'then', 'steps', 'using', 'synthesizer', 'was', ""n't"", 'invented', 'decades', 'films', 'were', 'first', 'shown', 'truly', 'distracting', 'listen', 'otherwise', 'good', 'accompaniment', 'tarnished', 'electronic', 'sounds', 'instead', 'real', 'clarinets', 'etc', 'Even', 'organ', 'reeks', 'synthesis', 'Originally', 'films', 'were', 'accompanied', 'piano', 'pipe', 'organ', 'vaudeville', 'orchestra', 'other', 'companies', 'follow', 'precedent', 'Okay', 'know', 'stay', 'budget', 'one', 'find', 'annoying', 'along', 'fuzzy', 'prints.Hard', 'complain', 'price', 'lot', 'enjoyment', 'buck']",N/A

(The movie selection business was a bit illogical and tricky to figure out&#8230;I had to go through it afterwards to see if I had actually watched all the movies.)The Charley Chase movies are probably the reason to buy this set. You get five of his movies and I&#8217;d never seen him before, but they were all of the better quality humour. Mind you there was a definite sense that he was similar to Harold Lloyd in his mannerisms. Still the 5 were worth the price of admission.Then you got a newer (1987) silent. First, when you clicked on it you ended up about a minute into the movie and had to back track to get to the beginning. The movie was OK and did have some genuine silent era flavour to it in places. But it was clearly a newer sort as the technology, though they tried to mimic old footage problems, still had a new flavour to it. It was obviously a low budget affair too as one clue was the deliberate avoidance of street scenes. Only one vintage car was shown and on a private driveway. Still it was genuinely fun, but it&#8217;s didn&#8217;t quite capture the real feel of the older silents.The 1913 &#8220;The locket&#8221; was only about 10 minutes long, which explained why the story and solution was so simple and straightforward. They had to get the story done by the end of the one reel. So the solving of the mystery was incredible in it&#8217;s luck. But what do you expect for a 1913 one reeler. It was fun, but short.The two Chaplin offerings,) &#8220;Laffin Gas&#8221;, and &#8220;Face on the Barroom Floor&#8221; were I think the first I&#8217;d seen either of these movies, but was real annoyed with the sound effects they added. It appears they were added in 1961, so you can&#8217;t fault the packagers, but the sound effects were just plain stupid and took the fun right out of watching them. Perhaps in 1961 this was supposed to be funny, but I thought it was awful, and distracting.Then you get &#8220;Post no Bills&#8221; and &#8220;Prince Pistachio&#8221; The first of these was limited in it&#8217;s repetitive gag which was also limited in it&#8217;s humour, but they kept on with the same gag the entire show with no real story or plot and it ends abruptly. About the only thing about it that&#8217;s interesting is the real city settings. The humour was lame, childish, repetitive and nothing different was offered.The latter, &#8220;Prince Pistachio&#8221;, though I&#8217;d heard of it, I thought it might therefore be a good one. It started out pretty good like a classis silent comedy, and how he got to Persia was a bit of a laugh, and some of the names given the Persian people were funny, but the &#8220;pulling the strings&#8221; and the other stuff just I thought fell a bit flat and then the end. It was just a farce that stretched beyond the limitations of any sort of plot with things to happen because they might be funny. I don&#8217;t know, I wasn&#8217;t too impressed with this one either.The last offering was a dull&#8221; Documentary&#8221; about the Fox 23rd annual convention(1925). With distance shots of people in suits&#8230;I guess they had to put it somewhere, but it was anticlimactic for this set&#8230;.and generally speaking very dull.  So the last half of this set was just downhill.a b c d e g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z",3,starts good then goes downhill,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,3393,"['get', 'dozen', 'movies', 'only', 'five', 'six', 'are', 'better', 'variety', 'movie', 'selection', 'business', 'was', 'bit', 'illogical', 'tricky', 'figure', 'out', '8230', 'had', 'go', 'see', 'had', 'actually', 'watched', 'movies', 'Charley', 'Chase', 'movies', 'are', 'probably', 'reason', 'buy', 'set', 'get', 'five', 'movies', '8217', 'never', 'seen', 'were', 'better', 'quality', 'humour', 'Mind', 'was', 'definite', 'sense', 'was', 'similar', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'mannerisms', 'Still', '5', 'were', 'worth', 'price', 'admission.Then', 'got', 'newer', '1987', 'silent', 'First', 'when', 'clicked', 'ended', 'up', 'minute', 'movie', 'had', 'back', 'track', 'get', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'OK', 'did', 'have', 'genuine', 'silent', 'era', 'flavour', 'places', 'was', 'clearly', 'newer', 'sort', 'technology', 'tried', 'mimic', 'old', 'footage', 'problems', 'still', 'had', 'new', 'flavour', 'was', 'obviously', 'low', 'budget', 'affair', 'too', 'one', 'clue', 'was', 'deliberate', 'avoidance', 'street', 'scenes', 'Only', 'one', 'vintage', 'car', 'was', 'shown', 'private', 'driveway', 'Still', 'was', 'genuinely', 'fun', '8217', 'didn', '8217', 'quite', 'capture', 'real', 'feel', 'older', 'silents.The', '1913', '8220', 'locket', '8221', 'was', 'only', 'about', '10', 'minutes', 'long', 'explained', 'why', 'story', 'solution', 'was', 'so', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'had', 'get', 'story', 'done', 'end', 'one', 'reel', 'solving', 'mystery', 'was', 'incredible', '8217', 's', 'luck', 'what', 'do', 'expect', '1913', 'one', 'reeler', 'was', 'fun', 'short.The', 'two', 'Chaplin', 'offerings', '8220', 'Laffin', 'Gas', '8221', '8220', 'Face', 'Barroom', 'Floor', '8221', 'were', 'think', 'first', '8217', 'seen', 'movies', 'was', 'real', 'annoyed', 'sound', 'effects', 'added', 'were', 'added', '1961', 'can', '8217', 'fault', 'packagers', 'sound', 'effects', 'were', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'took', 'fun', 'right', 'watching', 'Perhaps', '1961', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'thought', 'was', 'awful', 'distracting.Then', 'get', '8220', 'Post', 'Bills', '8221', '8220', 'Prince', 'Pistachio', '8221', 'first', 'was', 'limited', '8217', 'repetitive', 'gag', 'was', 'also', 'limited', '8217', 's', 'humour', 'kept', 'same', 'gag', 'entire', 'show', 'real', 'story', 'plot', 'abruptly', 'only', 'thing', '8217', 'interesting', 'real', 'city', 'settings', 'humour', 'was', 'lame', 'childish', 'repetitive', 'nothing', 'different', 'was', 'offered.The', 'latter', '8220', 'Prince', 'Pistachio', '8221', '8217', 'heard', 'thought', 'might', 'therefore', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'started', 'out', 'pretty', 'good', 'classis', 'silent', 'comedy', 'how', 'got', 'Persia', 'was', 'bit', 'laugh', 'names', 'given', 'Persian', 'people', 'were', 'funny', '8220', 'pulling', 'strings', '8221', 'other', 'stuff', 'just', 'thought', 'fell', 'bit', 'flat', 'then', 'end', 'was', 'just', 'farce', 'stretched', 'limitations', 'sort', 'plot', 'things', 'happen', 'might', 'be', 'funny', 'don', '8217', 't', 'know', 'wasn', '8217', 't', 'too', 'impressed', 'one', 'either.The', 'last', 'offering', 'was', 'dull', '8221', 'Documentary', '8221', 'Fox', '23rd', 'annual', 'convention', '1925', 'distance', 'shots', 'people', 'suits', '8230', 'guess', 'had', 'put', 'somewhere', 'was', 'anticlimactic', 'set', '8230', '.and', 'generally', 'speaking', 'very', 'dull', 'last', 'half', 'set', 'was', 'just', 'downhill.a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']",N/A
