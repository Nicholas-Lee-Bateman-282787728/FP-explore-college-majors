677895,AH4SL0YL5AQVU,B00005R5G8,Alric the Red,"[2, 3]","Winner of one Australian Film Institute award (Best Achievement in Costume Design) and nominated for five others (including Best Actor for Bryan Brown), this film from 1987 is a quiet masterpiece.  It's strong on character development, permitting the actors to do their work without a lot of clutter.  Rachel Ward (winner of Best Actress at the Tokyo International Film Festival) was beautiful as the painfully naive Marge Hills, a woman who desired romance beyond what her humdrum reality could provide.  She's introduced to us on her knees at chores, with other events quick to follow that tell us she's a person whose true value is taken for granted, leaving her isolated in a practical world.  Aware of an inexpressible longing, she escapes through tabloids with far-out stories of faraway places.  This is only briefly but vividly touched upon before the story heats up.  She makes a bad decision that drives her deeper into her dreamy notions of passon and romance to the detriment of her relationship with her husband.  Sam Neill is excellent as the oily bartender Neville Gifford, hiding his disdain for women behind his smarmy urbanity.  Marge's emotional decline in pursuit of this completely unlikable debaucher is hard to watch.Seeing this only once back when it was new, I was so touched by it, I've thought about it over the span with special favor.  It's not a title you see on shelves anywhere, so you're not going to get an opportunity to buy it on impulse.  It was on my wish list for a long time, and I just recently decided to spring for it.  Every bit as affective as it was twenty years ago, it was a very good looking film, to boot.  The nomination for cinematography was definitely deserved, and made an already fine story a pleasure to watch again.  I wouldn't mind seeing it in Blu-ray.  It's got that look.The DVD itself has no special features, other than the original theatrical trailer and previews.  None of that matters to me, but if it matters to you, it's worth noting.  It's a beautiful film, and anyone who appreciates, without being judgmental, how and why we can complicate things will find it time well spent.  It was a very sympathetic portrait, and I've never stopped thinking about it.____________________________________________________________________________",4,One of those Underrated Gems,1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,2303,"['Winner', 'one', 'Australian', 'Film', 'Institute', 'award', 'Best', 'Achievement', 'Costume', 'Design', 'nominated', 'five', 'others', 'including', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'film', '1987', 'quiet', 'masterpiece', 'strong', 'character', 'development', 'permitting', 'actors', 'do', 'work', 'lot', 'clutter', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'winner', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Tokyo', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'was', 'beautiful', 'painfully', 'naive', 'Marge', 'Hills', 'woman', 'who', 'desired', 'romance', 'what', 'humdrum', 'reality', 'could', 'provide', 'introduced', 'knees', 'chores', 'other', 'events', 'quick', 'follow', 'tell', 'person', 'true', 'value', 'taken', 'granted', 'leaving', 'isolated', 'practical', 'world', 'Aware', 'inexpressible', 'longing', 'tabloids', 'far-out', 'stories', 'faraway', 'places', 'only', 'briefly', 'vividly', 'touched', 'story', 'up', 'bad', 'decision', 'deeper', 'dreamy', 'notions', 'passon', 'romance', 'detriment', 'relationship', 'husband', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'excellent', 'oily', 'bartender', 'Neville', 'Gifford', 'hiding', 'disdain', 'women', 'smarmy', 'urbanity', 'Marge', 'emotional', 'decline', 'pursuit', 'completely', 'unlikable', 'debaucher', 'hard', 'watch.Seeing', 'only', 'once', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'was', 'so', 'touched', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'span', 'special', 'favor', 'not', 'title', 'see', 'shelves', 'anywhere', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'opportunity', 'buy', 'impulse', 'was', 'wish', 'list', 'long', 'time', 'just', 'recently', 'decided', 'spring', 'Every', 'bit', 'as', 'affective', 'was', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'film', 'boot', 'nomination', 'cinematography', 'was', 'definitely', 'deserved', 'made', 'already', 'fine', 'story', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'again', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'Blu-ray', 'got', 'look.The', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'other', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'previews', 'None', 'matters', 'worth', 'noting', 'beautiful', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'being', 'judgmental', 'how', 'why', 'can', 'complicate', 'things', 'will', 'find', 'time', 'well', 'spent', 'was', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'portrait', ""'ve"", 'never', 'stopped', 'thinking', 'it.____________________________________________________________________________']",N/A

Bored with small town life and husband Sonny's bedroom abilities (she counts ceiling tiles while he's ""having at it"") Marge and creep-o brother-in-law Sugar (Vidler) brazenly ask Sonny (Brown) if they can, well.... you know...  and Sonny apathetically agrees!Dapper Neville Gifford (Neill) arrives on a train to take a barman's job at the only hotel in town. He immediately spots the umbrella-toting Marge on the street and just like --that-- she's pinned to a fence while Neville gropes the goods. Marge resists and refuses to go to a room with the steamy Gifford by indignantly declaring that ""I'm a married woman!"" Yeah, but to WHOM? Sonny or his brother?Neville then sports with every gal in town EXCEPT Marge, who now pursues him like an IRS man at tax time. He tells her in no uncertain terms to go away, which only increases Marge's determination to get into his..... hotel room. After one of Neville's peccadillos goes awry he's told to leave town by a fat constable ""or else."" Back on the train, the sportin' man is surprised when Marge shows up and begs to be taken with him. The outraged Neville tosses Marge, her suitcase and umbrella off the moving train. She's brought home all banged up and the story ends as it began: the catatonic Marge totally bored and depressed.Also recommended:Northern Irishman Sam Neill appears in the Cold War thrillerTHE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER(1990) as a Russian Navy defector who just wants ""to see Montana.""Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(5.9) The Good Wife (""The Umbrella Woman"") (Australia-1987) - Rachel Ward/Bryan Brown/Steven Vidler/Sam Neill/Jennifer Claire/Bruce Barry/Ned Hopper/Carole Skinner",3,Australian-style Depression cinema,1233792000,"02 5, 2009",2009,1841,"['SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'set', '1930s', 'depression', 'Aussie-made', 'THE', 'UMBRELLA', 'WOMAN', 'Good', 'Wife', 'actually', 'Marge', 'Hills', 'Ward', 'Bored', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'husband', 'Sonny', 'bedroom', 'abilities', 'ceiling', 'tiles', 'having', 'Marge', 'creep-o', 'brother-in-law', 'Sugar', 'Vidler', 'brazenly', 'ask', 'Sonny', 'Brown', 'can', 'well', 'know', 'Sonny', 'apathetically', 'Dapper', 'Neville', 'Gifford', 'Neill', 'train', 'take', 'barman', 'job', 'only', 'hotel', 'town', 'immediately', 'spots', 'umbrella-toting', 'Marge', 'street', 'just', 'like', 'pinned', 'fence', 'Neville', 'goods', 'Marge', 'resists', 'refuses', 'go', 'room', 'steamy', 'Gifford', 'indignantly', 'declaring', ""'m"", 'married', 'woman', 'Yeah', 'WHOM', 'Sonny', 'brother', 'Neville', 'then', 'sports', 'gal', 'town', 'EXCEPT', 'Marge', 'who', 'now', 'IRS', 'man', 'tax', 'time', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'go', 'away', 'only', 'Marge', 'determination', 'get', '..', 'hotel', 'room', 'one', 'Neville', 'peccadillos', 'told', 'leave', 'town', 'fat', 'constable', 'else', 'Back', 'train', 'sportin', 'man', 'surprised', 'when', 'Marge', 'up', 'begs', 'be', 'taken', 'outraged', 'Neville', 'tosses', 'Marge', 'suitcase', 'umbrella', 'moving', 'train', 'brought', 'home', 'banged', 'up', 'story', 'began', 'catatonic', 'Marge', 'totally', 'bored', 'depressed.Also', 'recommended', 'Northern', 'Irishman', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Cold', 'War', 'thrillerTHE', 'HUNT', 'FOR', 'RED', 'OCTOBER', '1990', 'Russian', 'Navy', 'defector', 'who', 'just', 'see', 'Montana', 'Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'IMDb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '5.9', 'Good', 'Wife', 'Umbrella', 'Woman', 'Australia-1987', 'Rachel', 'Ward/Bryan', 'Brown/Steven', 'Vidler/Sam', 'Neill/Jennifer', 'Claire/Bruce', 'Barry/Ned', 'Hopper/Carole', 'Skinner']",N/A

677899,A1REZUQZMJUFW2,B00005R5G8,Lovesbooks,"[4, 9]","I agree with m.h.r. Bbettina that it is strange that this movie got more than 2 stars from other reviewers, let alone even one, in my opinion.  Admittedly, I didn't see the whole thing but from what I did see, it was enough to develop some intense dislike for the characters, especially for Rachel Ward's desperate, love-obsessed character, Marge Hills, and Sam Neill's character, Neville Gifford. The plot wasn't anything to call home about but I would imagine it was developed to describe broken, unfaithful homes back in 1930s Australia or some homes in general, back in those days (and maybe for homes nowadays). The scene with the husband's brother, Sugar Hills, and the wife having sex was very strange, especially with the husband, Sonny, consenting to any of it and even listening in on it.  If anything, from my point of view, I would think that the only person of any integrity and interest in the movie besides the women in town who were worried about Ward's marriage and were doing their best to intervene and help out whenever they can is the long-suffering husband.  He's probably also the best-looking man in the whole movie, so it was confusing why Marge would find Neville attractive in any way, other than the fact that she was attracted to the forbidden (infidelity).  So if you're not a fan of people breaking their vows and committing adultry, skip this movie.  It doesn't show the ideal ""good wife""; instead, it shows the image of a bad, love-obsessed, trying-to-be-unfaithful wife.  In fact, maybe, it's better that everyone just avoid this movie altogether.  If you want to see some healthy drama, the Lifetime channel shows some really good flicks, and plus, you can save a buck or two.",1,"""Good Wife"" is actually Bad Wife",1228348800,"12 4, 2008",2008,1711,"['agree', 'm.h.r', 'Bbettina', 'strange', 'movie', 'got', 'more', '2', 'stars', 'other', 'reviewers', 'let', 'alone', 'even', 'one', 'opinion', 'Admittedly', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'whole', 'thing', 'what', 'did', 'see', 'was', 'enough', 'develop', 'intense', 'dislike', 'characters', 'especially', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'desperate', 'love-obsessed', 'character', 'Marge', 'Hills', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'character', 'Neville', 'Gifford', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'call', 'home', 'would', 'imagine', 'was', 'developed', 'describe', 'broken', 'unfaithful', 'homes', 'back', '1930s', 'Australia', 'homes', 'general', 'back', 'days', 'maybe', 'homes', 'nowadays', 'scene', 'husband', 'brother', 'Sugar', 'Hills', 'wife', 'having', 'sex', 'was', 'very', 'strange', 'especially', 'husband', 'Sonny', 'consenting', 'even', 'listening', 'anything', 'point', 'view', 'would', 'think', 'only', 'person', 'integrity', 'interest', 'movie', 'women', 'town', 'who', 'were', 'worried', 'Ward', 'marriage', 'were', 'doing', 'best', 'intervene', 'help', 'out', 'whenever', 'can', 'long-suffering', 'husband', 'probably', 'also', 'best-looking', 'man', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'confusing', 'why', 'Marge', 'would', 'find', 'Neville', 'attractive', 'way', 'other', 'fact', 'was', 'attracted', 'forbidden', 'infidelity', 'So', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'people', 'breaking', 'vows', 'committing', 'adultry', 'skip', 'movie', ""n't"", 'show', 'ideal', 'good', 'wife', 'instead', 'image', 'bad', 'love-obsessed', 'trying-to-be-unfaithful', 'wife', 'fact', 'maybe', 'better', 'everyone', 'just', 'avoid', 'movie', 'altogether', 'want', 'see', 'healthy', 'drama', 'Lifetime', 'channel', 'really', 'good', 'flicks', 'can', 'save', 'buck', 'two']",N/A

Bryan invites his younger brother, the naive Sugar, to live with them. Sugar asks Marge for sexual experience. Marge and Sunny acquiese. Sugar is lonely, Marge is bored, Sunny feels obligated to look after his brother.The short unsatisfying sexual experience between Marge and Sugar leaves Marge feeling wistful. One day in town the new barkeep, Neville, played by New Zealander Sam Neil, puts the hard word on Marge. Marge declines and Neville tells her ""a woman only gets one chance with me"" and walks away. From that point on, Marge is obsessed and wants what she can't have. Neville is a ""playa"" to the extreme-putting the moves on women ""since he was a kid"", hoping to find the ""one"". Marge puts her marriage and reputation at risk to follow Neville and watch his sexual escapades.This movie explores the age old theme of women being sexually attracted to men who treat them poorly. Neville is an unconscious incompotent, believing he's going to find the right woman by ""treating them mean and keeping them keen"". Marge's husband, Sunny is seriously hot and masculine, so I'm not sure I get her motivations for desiring the slimy Neville, but there is no accounting for taste. Love and desire drive humans to the inexplicable.A good movie about the odd connections that develop between people in a small town. Well acted. Bryan Brown is a gorgeous and sensitively created.
