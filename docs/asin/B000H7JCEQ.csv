I have only in the past year began to get addicted to this particular CSI series.  When I started out I had to buy all of the previous seasons to catch up with what was going on.  Then since David Caruso is such and interesting character, I looked up and bought NYPD Blue because he starred in it the first season.I love the scenery, being a north Floridian I appreciate the beauty of the area and envy the tropical follage that grows there.  Miami is one of the stars of this show, the characters are interesting and complex and you just can't seem to get enough of them.Worth the price, they made this summer of re-runs more bearable.",5,Wonderful collection of DVDs,1188518400,"08 31, 2007",2007,703,"['am', 'late', 'bloomer', 'when', 'come', 'television', 'have', 'only', 'past', 'year', 'began', 'get', 'addicted', 'particular', 'CSI', 'series', 'When', 'started', 'out', 'had', 'buy', 'previous', 'seasons', 'catch', 'up', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Then', 'David', 'Caruso', 'such', 'interesting', 'character', 'looked', 'up', 'bought', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'starred', 'first', 'season.I', 'love', 'scenery', 'being', 'north', 'Floridian', 'appreciate', 'beauty', 'area', 'envy', 'tropical', 'follage', 'there', 'Miami', 'one', 'stars', 'show', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'complex', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'enough', 'them.Worth', 'price', 'made', 'summer', 're-runs', 'more', 'bearable']",C.S.I.

I began to watch CSI Miami, more than the others, because I became so interested in the characters. I couldn`t believe how compassionate the Medical Examiner (Khandi Alexander) was, with her ""charges"". It also became a mystery to me about the complicated plots, and how they figured out the truth!The reason I bought the DVDs, besides being able to see them whenever I wanted, was because I missed quite a few shows, and had to watch re-runs. During some of the re-runs, things were mentioned, that I had no idea what they meant, and I was intent on finding out the answers. Thanks to the DVDs, I can find out all the answers. I think the CSI Series are some of the best shows on TV.",5,One of the Best Forensic Shows on TV,1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,766,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'three', 'CSI', 'shows', 'time', 'love', 'Forensics', 'began', 'watch', 'CSI', 'Miami', 'more', 'others', 'became', 'so', 'interested', 'characters', 'couldn', 't', 'believe', 'how', 'compassionate', 'Medical', 'Examiner', 'Khandi', 'Alexander', 'was', 'charges', 'also', 'became', 'mystery', 'complicated', 'plots', 'how', 'figured', 'out', 'truth', 'reason', 'bought', 'DVDs', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'whenever', 'wanted', 'was', 'missed', 'quite', 'few', 'shows', 'had', 'watch', 're-runs', 're-runs', 'things', 'were', 'mentioned', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'meant', 'was', 'intent', 'finding', 'out', 'answers', 'Thanks', 'DVDs', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'answers', 'think', 'CSI', 'Series', 'are', 'best', 'shows', 'TV']",C.S.I.
