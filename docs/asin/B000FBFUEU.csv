987175,A7I4B28V59EI9,B000FBFUEU,"Chandib ""Serendeepity""","[2, 3]","I enjoy Tracey Mallett's Burn It DVD.  Frankly, Its NOT an easy workout. Maybe thats good news to some and bad news for others. I'd definitely say between Intermediate to Advanced Level.  You have to be working out for sometime at a Beginner to Intermediate Level to be able to get through the entire duration of this DVD.I have to say its not a DVD I can pick up on any day and say sure I'll workout.  On those days, I need something lighter like Janis Saffels cardio fix. But like Tracey recommends if you want to shape up right, do this 3 to 4 times a week.  I do it more like twice a week and light workouts on other days.This DVD contains resistance, aerobics, kickboxing, stretching and ab work.  So its a complete workout.  But yeah, if you are like me, you'll probably want to pair another DVD to go along with this on other days of the week.As an instructor, she is cheery, and seems to be trying quite a bit to include the ""fun"" element.  I like to be positive, so I look at it in a nice way.  She's got her thick British accent too which is enjoyable as well.Equipment wise, you will need dumbells and decent floor space, couple of sections call for you to move around. You could do it in place, but you are better off with at least 5x7 space.  Overall, if you don't have too much space and just enough, this is still doable, I still wouldn't pass on this DVD.Each time I do this DVD, I am certain that I'll get a very good workout to the point that I'll definitely be quite sore and don't have to worry about focusing on various body parts.  Its quite complete.",4,Enjoyable,1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,1573,"['enjoy', 'Tracey', 'Mallett', 'Burn', 'DVD', 'Frankly', 'NOT', 'easy', 'workout', 'Maybe', 'thats', 'good', 'news', 'bad', 'news', 'others', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'say', 'Intermediate', 'Advanced', 'Level', 'have', 'be', 'working', 'out', 'sometime', 'Beginner', 'Intermediate', 'Level', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'entire', 'duration', 'DVD.I', 'have', 'say', 'not', 'DVD', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'day', 'say', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'workout', 'days', 'need', 'something', 'lighter', 'Janis', 'Saffels', 'cardio', 'fix', 'Tracey', 'want', 'shape', 'up', 'right', 'do', '3', '4', 'times', 'week', 'do', 'more', 'twice', 'week', 'light', 'workouts', 'other', 'days.This', 'DVD', 'resistance', 'aerobics', 'kickboxing', 'stretching', 'ab', 'work', 'complete', 'workout', 'yeah', 'are', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'pair', 'DVD', 'go', 'along', 'other', 'days', 'week.As', 'instructor', 'cheery', 'be', 'trying', 'quite', 'bit', 'include', 'fun', 'element', 'like', 'be', 'positive', 'look', 'nice', 'way', 'got', 'thick', 'British', 'accent', 'too', 'enjoyable', 'well.Equipment', 'wise', 'will', 'need', 'dumbells', 'decent', 'floor', 'space', 'couple', 'sections', 'call', 'move', 'around', 'could', 'do', 'place', 'are', 'better', 'off', 'least', '5x7', 'space', 'Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'space', 'just', 'enough', 'still', 'doable', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'pass', 'DVD.Each', 'time', 'do', 'DVD', 'am', 'certain', ""'ll"", 'get', 'very', 'good', 'workout', 'point', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'be', 'quite', 'sore', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'focusing', 'various', 'body', 'parts', 'quite', 'complete']",Tracey Mallett Superbody Boot Camp: Burn It

I like that they are circuit training with compound moves that work multi-muscle groups at once mixed in with some cardio to really kick up the metabolism.I like that they are broken up into segments so you can mix and match based on time.Some of the moves are challenging, but she doesn't have you doing them so long that it feels unbearable.  You get a great burn.  You can go at your own pace as she does have one exerciser doing modify movements.If you enjoy any of her other videos you will enjoy this.

987177,A1HLC3A2B1SXC,B000FBFUEU,Danie',"[3, 3]","This intermediate-level (I wouldn't dare give a lower level) workout is broken up into segments which you can jump to on the menu but unlike other segmented workout videos, this workout is not customizable (i.e. the 10-min Solution workouts).  While there is a modifier in this workout, she pretty much does all the moves at the same level as everyone else.  The instructor sounds as if she has a lisp, so it's kind of hard to understand what she's saying, even after viewing the workout multiple times.If you have bad knees, be forewarned:  there are a LOT of squats in this workout.  They are used in both the actual workout segments and used as a transition move between exercises.I don't think of myself as being necessarily picky so while these things might bother other people, I wasn't deterred to give this a try.Equipment:  One set 3-5 pounds hand weights and an exercise mat.  Oh, yeah . . . you're gonna need a bit of space for some of the moves.Segments:Basic Training:  Basically a warm-up.  Includes step-touches, bob and weaves, various punches (jabs, crosses, hooks, upper-cuts), squats, kicks, and stretchesDrill Segment:  Jogs, gallops, football runs, ""in and outs"" (jumping jacks w/o the arms) and jabs, squats w/ chest flies, cutsey squats and lateral raises, jump squatsPower Segment:  ""Prepare"" (pivoting to ""prepare"" to kick), squats, ""Prepare"" to a round-house kick, side steps, snap kicks, body builders, mountain climbersUltimate Drill: Jab/cross/squat combo, high/low jabs, gallopsIntense Body Burn:  Forward flies, ""monkey jumps"" (she doesn't give a name to these but that's what I've heard them referred to as) alternating between full jumps and a low-impact version with no jumpsPush-Up Segment:  A total of 20 regular push-ups, forward and side lunges, football runs and quick punchesCool Down:  A less intense repeat of the warm-up*Bonus:  Six-Pack Abs:  A 10-min Pilates inspired ab workoutMy personal Pros and Cons:PROS:1.  This workout will definitely get your heart-rate up.2.  This work-out is challenging. (The background exercisers apparently thought so, too.  They would completely stop or do their own modified versions throughout the workout.)3.  Tracey cues pretty well.CONS:1.  Like another reviewer said, this workout (particularly the kickboxing portions) seemed a bit amaturish.2.  During the parts where weights are used, the camera does a quick fade in/fade out and the exercisers already have their weights and are performing the exercise before you even get yours in your hand.  I could have let that side, if it wasn't consistant.3.  There is virtually no instruction on technique.  There are a couple of moves (very, very few) that she ""previews"" (i.e. body-builders) but that's all.4.  Tracey just seemed to try way too hard to be cheerful and perky.  This made her seem fake and corny.  Typically, perky instructors don't bother me but she was way over the top.This is my first Tracey Mallett workout and I was REALLY excited to do this.  Unfortunately, I just couldn't get passed the negatives.

Right on the shelf was my go to DVD, Boot Camp by Tracey Mallett.  This DVD works better than any other DVD I use and once I get the results I stop using it and go buy some other DVD.  This DVD is great because Tracey has the type of body I like, thin and non-muscular, she knows the right moves to do.  Also, Tracey has the BEST ABS on the market.  She actually has a 6 pack and you rarely see that on women, even Jillian Michaels.The DVD is mainly jabs, lunges, various forms of jacks on the floor and running men on the floor along with weighted moves like the flies and the lunges.I am tired doing this DVD.  This is a DVD where you can UP the intensity yourself by using higher weights or jumping or jabbing with weights, it's pretty variable.My issue had become my stomach from drinking so many sodas.  Doing this DVD once or twice always goes right into that part of the stomach that wants to gain weight and widdle it down.Tracey Mallet would be a much bigger exercise DVD seller, but for the fact that she seems like a cheerleader rather than a trainer.  People shouldn't sleep on her though, on this DVD, at least because she is really good.Some of other DVDs are bad though...the latest ones just copy the moves off this one and her Cardio Bootcamp is just cheesy because she mixes pilates and dance moves with bad outfits to try to make herself more marketable.Note: This review was written April 16, 2011.

The only NOT positive aspect is that sometimes she does this fast squat between moves and I have to be super careful to not do that as my knees are not great and she goes a bit faster than what feels comfortable for ME.I actually looked her up after doing the video a few times and found some classes she teaches personally. She is great!!",5,awesome workout!,1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,698,"['was', 'so', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'video', 'bought', 'whim', 'knowing', 'anything', 'instructor', 'Tracey', 'Mallett', 'GREAT', 'love', 'attitude', 'most', 'importantly', 'workouts', 'kicked', 'butt', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'fit/exercise', 'lot', 'hard', 'find', 'workout', 'video', 'actually', 'comparable', 'class', 'gym', 'totally', 'only', 'NOT', 'positive', 'aspect', 'sometimes', 'fast', 'squat', 'moves', 'have', 'be', 'super', 'careful', 'not', 'do', 'knees', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'bit', 'faster', 'what', 'comfortable', 'ME.I', 'actually', 'looked', 'up', 'doing', 'video', 'few', 'times', 'found', 'classes', 'personally', 'great']",Tracey Mallett Superbody Boot Camp: Burn It
