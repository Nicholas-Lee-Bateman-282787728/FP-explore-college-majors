790478,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00011D1MC,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Rain, 1932 filmThe movie begins with clouds and rain. There is singing from a group of soldiers. They want cigarettes. Does it ever stop raining? People present their passports for inspection. The ship is quarantined because one sailor has cholera (a dangerous disease still). One important visitor is a reformer to inspect the island. Then we see ""Red"" smoking a cigarette. ""Hello, soldier!"" Sadie wants a cheap hotel room (to keep expenses down). The natives enjoy life, eating and singing. [Unlike the rest of the world?] Sadie doesn't need glasses, she drinks out of the bottle. Drinking and dancing on the Sabbath? How scandalous! [Are the people overdressed for the heat?] Mr. Davidson stares at Sadie. Will there be trouble? Davidson complains to the Governor. The ladies complain about Sadie's presence. Is the ""right thing"" a matter of opinion? Will Davidson try to save Miss Thompson?They converse, and Sadie tells about her past. Can she atone for her past life? Salvation or destruction? Is she doomed? Sergeant O'Hara visits her again (he too is from Kansas). Why doesn't Sadie want to go back to the States or Honolulu? What about Sidney? What if the Governor orders her off the island? Davidson used his connections to force the Governor's hand. Can Sadie get a few days delay? She tells why she doesn't want to return to San Francisco: there is a charge against her. Atonement for her sins? Sadie prays with Davidson. Then Sgt. O'Hara shows up with a plan for Sadie's escape. But Sadie must accept her punishment, guilty or innocent, because Davidson says so. ""I'll never forget you, ever."" Everything is clear to Sadie now. The drumming suggests the natives are restless. Sadie and Davidson talk about the future. What will Davidson do now? The next day brings sunshine. The fisherman find a body in the sea. ""I wonder why he did it?"" Sadie plays music again. Why? She feels like her old self, and will now go to Sidney.You have to surmise why Davidson did what he did. Punishment for his sins? [Is this story believable?] Was it meant as a parable about society? Did Davidson represent the failure of Prohibition? I never read the short story that was used for this movie, I suspect it also aged badly. Joan Crawford became a star, her name was at the bottom of the cast listing.

I give it only two stars, but I'm reluctant to call it ""bad.""I guess it might be described an ""art"" film.  Now I'm no art film maven, but I'm inclined to say that the people who put ""Rain"" together should probably give painting a try, because this film seems less a film than a series of portraits and landscapes all featuring the same menu of subjects, but a bit lacking in something to pull it all together and propel it along.The dearth of dialogue doesn't help.  It's rare to hear a full sentence from anyone, and rarer still to hear one character reply to something said by another.  And a great deal of what is actually said, always at what seems like a crucial juncture, is spoken in such lifeless tones it's as though the sheer weight of ennui bearing down as if to crush the long-suffering inhabitants of an insignificant little town agonizing through the final days of its death throes in the middle of an infinite nowhere, should, by itself, be enough to convey something profound.  Unfortunately, for me, it really doesn't work.  I mean, I tried.  I paid attention.  I sat through the whole film.  But, for me, it just doesn't work.In fact, several times, I found myself experiencing that odd phenomenon of driving, wherein one suddenly becomes aware of having been almost in a trance, with no memory of driving the last several miles.Fortunately, with a DVD, one can replay to see what was missed.However, one cannot miss the trains.  There are a great many trains in the film, or a few trains making many repeated appearances, at a rate of nearly one train per scene.  And these are the mile-long multiple-locomotive freight trains that roll endlessly through the American mid-west, carrying grain and coal and other bulk commodities.  They roll across haunted prairies, through desolate ghost towns, into and out of sunsets and sunrises, day and night, night and day.Roll on, majestic wayfarer, say I.  Roll on mighty diesel unit train.  Roll on toward the sea.  Imagine the symbolism.

Sadie is sexy, provocative, outspoken, and very friendly with the male G. I.'s who are also on the island with her.Sadie's ways really tick off Alfred Davidson (played by Walter Houston). Mr. Davidson is a judgmental, prudish missionary that will not rest until he gets Sadie deported. At first, Sadie has no intention of leaving and becomes incredibly indignant. Sadie says, ""you take care of your evil, and I'll take care of mine..."" -- words to live by.But, when she realizes that her deportation would be imminent she becomes very freighted and pleads with Alfred Davidson to allow her to stay.He doesn't relent, but Sadie changes her ways, nevertheless. She is no longer the flashy dresser or ""plaything"" for the men on the island and has accepted her deportation (and subsequent prison sentence in San Francisco.)On the eve of her return there is a climactic outcome and Sadie hightails it to Sydney; back to her old tricks!Joan Crawford was absolutely devastatingly beautiful in this picture, and her acting was firstrate. The fear in Sadie was so believable; and the anger that Sadie had towards the hypocrisy of the missionaries was purely evident. This is without a doubt Joan's best picture of the 30's.Poor Joan was crucified for this film (and for many since) when it was first released in 1932. Joan even publicly apologized to her beloved fans (who meant the world to her), because for the first time in her career they turned their back on her! No one wanted to see Joan Crawford play a wanton women of loose morals. They didn't realize that Joan Crawford was born to play the part of Sadie Thompson.This is one of my favorite Joan Crawford pictures, because her true acting abilities really shine. She also plays a very different character; since she was on loan from MGM she was no longer tied to the sweet love-triangles that they gave her during her heyday in the 30's.

790489,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B00011D1MC,Joker,"[1, 1]","For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this forgotten movie...Rain (1932) stars Joan Crawford and Walter Huston.  Crawford, under contract with MGM at the time, was out on loan to United Artists to make Rain after the huge success of Grand Hotel (1932).  The kind of role Crawford plays in Rain is unlike any of her usual roles she had played up to that point.  She usually played heroic roles and shop girl roles.  Now she was playing the role of a sinner, a loose woman, a hooker named Sadie Thompson.  Audiences at the time couldn't accept Crawford playing such a role, so this movie flopped at the box office.  Time has given this movie a huge boost, as modern day audiences accept this movie and Crawford's performance much more easily.  Crawford herself didn't like this movie, probably because it bombed.  She said that she overacted.  I do agree that she did overact in some parts, but Crawford gives a great performance.  A different role, yes.  But her acting works so well for her character.  Crawford looks the part as well, and her entrance in the movie is legendary.  This movie is a good example of an actress showing her versatility, but unfortunately the subject matter of the movie and perhaps some tunnel vision by people at the time is what made this a flop in 1932.  It's amazing how audiences can't accept an actor playing a different kind of role than what they're accustomed to.One of the things I like about this movie is the atmosphere.  It's a rather dark movie and it rains a lot throughout, hence the title ""Rain"".  I also like the way a lot of the scenes were shot and some of the camera angles.  The movie seems ahead of its time.In my opinion, Rain is one of Crawford's best movies from the 1930s.  I think the movie holds up pretty well.

790490,A2KXO2YFOMF0UH,B00011D1MC,Linda,"[0, 0]","""Rain"" is based on a short story by W. Sommerset Maugham. A very young and lovely Joan Crawford gives a wonderful performance as a former prostitute on the lamb. You see little of the later persona she created for herself here but she was perfectly suited to the part. She meets a powerful and opinionated preacher and his prudish wife on the island of Pago Pago in the Rainy season and by means of what most of which seems much like cruelty tries to convert her to his own religious beliefs and the consequences of that belief to her personal life. Other travelers also add to the plot with their observances and opinions of the relationship between ""Sadie"" (the prostitute) and the Preacher. I won't tell the story and ruin it for you but there's a lot more going on in this drama. The ending is profound indeed but the real story is found in the dialog and the actions, thoughts and feelings of the characters. A true piece of classic storytelling. The role of ""Sadie"" was also played prior to this version by the beautiful Gloria Swanson in ""Sadie Thompson"" but the Joan Crawford version really holds up even now. A remake of this would be wonderful if someone would do it. I love this book and for Joan Crawford fans this movie is a must. Well worth the price. You'll want to watch it over and over and you'll notice something new each time. I recorded the audio book version of  ""Rain""(Version 2) by W. Sommerset Maugham on librivox and it's free to download and listen to so if you want a preview of the movie which stays marvelously close to the book please check it out.

This may have been a flop at the box office back in 1932; but I can see why this movie made it to DVD--it's actually quite a good film.The action begins when passengers on a boat are unexpectedly stuck on Pago Pago in the South Pacific after an outbreak of cholera. And there couldn't be two more opposite people amongst those passengers--Sadie Thompson (Joan Crawford), a loose woman, and a remarkably charismatic and somewhat nutty missionary named Alfred Davidson (Walter Huston). It isn't long before Sadie and the Marines on Pago Pago get friendly; and Alfred Davidson and his wife (Beulah Bondi) just can't stand it any longer. The Davidsons feel strongly that Sadie is a terrible sinner who must immediately repent for being loose, drinking liquor and dressing too ""loudly.""Sadie resists Mr. Davidson's attempts to ""reform"" her; and the most of the others at the hotel where they're staying generally support Sadie to one degree or another. They do come to fear the political connections Davidson has; and when Davidson complains to the Governor of Pago Pago, Sadie just might be in a whole lot of hot water that even her Marine boyfriend can't help!Joan Crawford is to be commended for a stunning performance as Sadie Thompson. The transformation of Sadie about one hour into the movie is astounding. Sadie is no longer a loose woman but instead she is now dressed very differently; she even completely agrees with the missionary Alfred Davidson that she must return to San Francisco to repent for her ""sins.""Why does Sadie not really want to go back to San Francisco? Will Sadie's Marine boyfriend ever hold off Davidson, or will Davidson win the tug of war over Sadie's future? What makes Sadie change--and will it last? No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie and find out!The DVD has no extras; but the movie held my attention so well it almost doesn't need any extras. The rain that almost constantly pours down on Pago Pago enhances the drama of the story in a good way, too.Overall, Joan Crawford fans will love this film. Rain is an excellent example of Joan giving an outstanding performance. Look for Walter Huston to give a stunning performance as the missionary Alfred Davidson; and Guy Kibbee fits in well as the owner of the hotel where the action takers place.",5,fine Joan Crawford movie--with an outstanding performance by Walter Huston,1207699200,"04 9, 2008",2008,2444,"['Rain', 'excellent', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'film', 'fine', 'acting', 'cast', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'work', 'well', 'too', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'flop', 'box', 'office', 'back', '1932', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'movie', 'made', 'DVD', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'film.The', 'action', 'when', 'passengers', 'boat', 'are', 'unexpectedly', 'stuck', 'Pago', 'Pago', 'South', 'Pacific', 'outbreak', 'cholera', 'there', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'two', 'more', 'opposite', 'people', 'amongst', 'passengers', 'Sadie', 'Thompson', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'loose', 'woman', 'remarkably', 'charismatic', 'somewhat', 'nutty', 'missionary', 'named', 'Alfred', 'Davidson', 'Walter', 'Huston', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Sadie', 'Marines', 'Pago', 'Pago', 'get', 'friendly', 'Alfred', 'Davidson', 'wife', 'Beulah', 'Bondi', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'longer', 'Davidsons', 'feel', 'strongly', 'Sadie', 'terrible', 'sinner', 'who', 'must', 'immediately', 'repent', 'being', 'loose', 'drinking', 'liquor', 'dressing', 'too', 'loudly', 'Sadie', 'Mr.', 'Davidson', 'attempts', 'reform', 'most', 'others', 'hotel', 'where', ""'re"", 'staying', 'generally', 'support', 'Sadie', 'one', 'degree', 'do', 'come', 'fear', 'political', 'connections', 'Davidson', 'when', 'Davidson', 'Governor', 'Pago', 'Pago', 'Sadie', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'whole', 'lot', 'hot', 'water', 'even', 'Marine', 'boyfriend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'be', 'commended', 'stunning', 'performance', 'Sadie', 'Thompson', 'transformation', 'Sadie', 'one', 'hour', 'movie', 'astounding', 'Sadie', 'no', 'longer', 'loose', 'woman', 'instead', 'now', 'dressed', 'very', 'differently', 'even', 'completely', 'missionary', 'Alfred', 'Davidson', 'must', 'return', 'San', 'Francisco', 'repent', 'sins', 'Why', 'Sadie', 'not', 'really', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Will', 'Sadie', 'Marine', 'boyfriend', 'ever', 'hold', 'off', 'Davidson', 'will', 'Davidson', 'win', 'tug', 'war', 'Sadie', 'future', 'What', 'Sadie', 'change', 'will', 'last', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'here', 'folks', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'DVD', 'extras', 'movie', 'held', 'attention', 'so', 'well', 'almost', ""n't"", 'need', 'extras', 'rain', 'almost', 'constantly', 'pours', 'down', 'Pago', 'Pago', 'drama', 'story', 'good', 'way', 'too.Overall', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'film', 'Rain', 'excellent', 'example', 'Joan', 'giving', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Look', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'give', 'stunning', 'performance', 'missionary', 'Alfred', 'Davidson', 'Guy', 'Kibbee', 'well', 'owner', 'hotel', 'where', 'action', 'takers', 'place']",N/A
