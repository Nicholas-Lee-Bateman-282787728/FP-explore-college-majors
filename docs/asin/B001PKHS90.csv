1227334,A1M181I8IYDLDA,B001PKHS90,Brandon Cozart,"[19, 19]","Mortal men might be ashamed at their pudginess, laziness, and gastronomical obsession, but not Jim Gaffigan.  Instead, Gaffigan uses these characteristics as punchlines that have surely earned him hundreds of dollars as he travels the country to inform the masses how much of a pig he is, and how they pretty much are too.  Fresh off his widely successful Beyond the Pale DVD, released in 2006, Jim Gaffigan has decided to once again grace us with his shockingly pale presence in his newest DVD, King Baby.Filmed during a stint in Austin, Texas, King Baby is perhaps best used as a pedagogical tool.  In it we learn the wonders of meat, the absurdities of camping, and the sheer genius of the escalator and snooze bar.  Of course, this is not all as there are many other topics discussed to both gladden the heart and inform the mind.Most known for his ""Hot Pockets"" bit, Gaffigan spends most of his time on stage talking about food in ways both memorable and ethereal.  After spending a little over an hour at the feet of this master of burlesque, the student will no doubt desire to adorn all food with bacon (or at least the most magical form of bacon:  the bits of bacon), only achieving perfection if done while lounging on the couch and watching television at the same time.In addition to the main feature, this disc also contains many insightful extras.  These include Comedy Central commercials for both the Beyond the Pale and King Baby specials, interviews with the baron of jest himself, PSAs for ""Our Massive Planet,"" and three ""Pale Force"" animated shorts.",4,absolute awesomeness,1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,1569,"['Mortal', 'men', 'might', 'be', 'ashamed', 'pudginess', 'laziness', 'gastronomical', 'obsession', 'not', 'Jim', 'Gaffigan', 'Instead', 'Gaffigan', 'characteristics', 'punchlines', 'have', 'surely', 'earned', 'hundreds', 'dollars', 'country', 'inform', 'masses', 'how', 'much', 'pig', 'how', 'pretty', 'much', 'are', 'too', 'Fresh', 'widely', 'successful', 'Pale', 'DVD', 'released', '2006', 'Jim', 'Gaffigan', 'decided', 'once', 'again', 'grace', 'shockingly', 'pale', 'presence', 'newest', 'DVD', 'King', 'Baby.Filmed', 'stint', 'Austin', 'Texas', 'King', 'Baby', 'perhaps', 'best', 'used', 'pedagogical', 'tool', 'learn', 'wonders', 'meat', 'absurdities', 'camping', 'sheer', 'genius', 'escalator', 'snooze', 'bar', 'course', 'not', 'all', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'topics', 'discussed', 'gladden', 'heart', 'inform', 'mind.Most', 'known', 'Hot', 'Pockets', 'bit', 'Gaffigan', 'most', 'time', 'stage', 'talking', 'food', 'ways', 'memorable', 'ethereal', 'spending', 'little', 'hour', 'feet', 'master', 'burlesque', 'student', 'will', 'doubt', 'desire', 'adorn', 'food', 'bacon', 'least', 'most', 'magical', 'form', 'bacon', 'bits', 'bacon', 'only', 'achieving', 'perfection', 'done', 'lounging', 'couch', 'watching', 'television', 'same', 'time.In', 'addition', 'main', 'feature', 'disc', 'also', 'many', 'insightful', 'extras', 'include', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'commercials', 'Beyond', 'Pale', 'King', 'Baby', 'specials', 'interviews', 'baron', 'jest', 'PSAs', 'Massive', 'Planet', 'three', 'Pale', 'Force', 'animated', 'shorts']",Jim Gaffigan: King Baby

1227339,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001PKHS90,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[13, 13]","If anyone can make jokes about bacon, being lazy, playing bowling and hot pockets for long period of time and make people laugh, Jim Gaffigan can  definitely make it happen!With the success of Gaffigan's Comedy Central DVD ""Beyond the Pale"", Gaffigan returns with ""King Baby"".  From the starting menu of the DVD featuring two young kids pigging out on BBQ ribs, you know that you're going to be in for a fun time.Filmed in Austin which capped off his sold-out 2008 stand-up tour, Gaffigan is on fire as his routine consists of going out bowling, being lazy, going camping, his bedroom, ketchup, waffle house and of course, being known for his comedy routine about bacon and much, much more.Featuring 30 minutes of extra footage not see in the ""Comedy Central"" special, Gaffigan's comedy at best is comedy that doesn't have to get explicit.  He literally talks about everyday things that people think about and makes it funny.  From getting a disease by putting your finger in the holes of a bowling ball to losing a remote while your laying down and of course, America's love for bacon.  These jokes are funny because people have experienced them and immediately know what he's talking about.His comedic delivery is smooth and constant and at times even poking fun at himself and using a high or an effeminate voice when criticizing his own jokes.  So, overall, ""King Baby"" was an enjoyable live performance by Gaffigan but despite the 70-minute runtime, you realize how much special features are packed on this DVD.  And there are a lot!VIDEO & AUDIO:""King Baby"" is featured in widescreen.  Picture quality is good with good angles from the front, side and towards the audience and above the audience.  Good editing and overall, easy to see.  No dizzying camera angle switching.As for the audio, audio is presented in English Stereo and English 5.1 Surround.  Audio is clear and you hear both Gaffigan and the audience quite clearly.SPECIAL FEATURES:As enjoyable as the 70-minute comedy performance for Gaffigan, part of the enjoyment of this DVD is watching the many hilarious special features included.  This DVD is packed with special features!  ""King Baby"" comes with the following Special Features:* Featurette: Pale Force - As seen on the ""Conan O'Brien"" comes ""Pale Force"".  Featuring three episodes of animated shorts that are about four minutes long.  ""Pale Force"" features the shirtless superhero duo Jim Gaffigan and Conan O'Brien who are known for their pale white skin and shooting lasers from their nipples.  In ""Sidekick"", Conan is complaining about becoming Jim's sidekick and him doing all the work but Jim getting all the credit.  In ""Land of the Robots"", Jim is fixing a robot which Conan accidentally turns on and thus being sent to an area where only robots reside.  In the third short titled ""Pale Christmas"", Conan celebrates Christmas Day and the series becomes a hilarious musical about being pale.* Featurette: Our Massive Planet - A total of four featurettes about a minute to three minutes long.  ""Our Massive Planet"" features interviews with a Professor Turgeon who talks about the wild but has never been outside of the US and his knowledge is based on what he learned from the Internet.  ""Credentials"" are about a guy being interviewed about the wild but has no true experience to talk about the wild.  ""Primates 2' is about primates being stuck indoor and using MySpace and enjoying the popcorn snacks poppycock.  ""Zebra"" features an interview with Prof. Turgeon who has footage of the wild but what  is thought of his travels in Africa, the footage is from the zoo.  In ""Dogs"", Prof. Turgeon talks about how to approach a dog.* Featurette: XM/Sirius Interview -  A 26-minute featurette from ""Unmasked - Live from Comix"" on XM/Sirus.  Gaffigan is introduced about his comedy career and answering questions from the audience.* Featurette: Never Aired British Interview - A British interview introducing Jim Gaffigan to UK audiences and about his ""Sexy Tour"".  Gaffigan talking about letting his sexiness out and how he became a comedian.  A featurette that is nearly seven minutes long.* Featurette: Atlanta: Meet and Greet On Demand - A near 10-minute featurette about Gaffigan's comedy tour and his stop in Atlanta.  Meeting with the fans and talking about his experience in Atlanta.* Featurette: The Sexy Tour -- Friday Night Stand Up - Features nine hilarious ""Friday Night Stand Up"" commercial segments with Gaffigan promoting a tour because he feels he is very sexy but yet everyone around him thinks he's unsexy.* Featurette: The Beyond the Pale Tour - Friday Night Stand Up - Features eleven hilarious ""Friday Night Stand Up"" commercial segments promoting Gaffigan's ""The Beyond the Pale Tour"".  Each segment is about a 30-seconds to a minute long.JUDGMENT CALL:""KING BABY"" is another enjoyable comedy performance from Jim Gaffigan.  Compared to many comedians featured on Comedy Central DVD's that would get into the sex and drop a bit of profanity in their routine, Gaffigan's comedy is not risque or profane.  It's straight up comedy about subjects that everyday people often wonder about and it's just the way it's delivered is how hilarious it can be.I can type an example of his jokes on this review and realize, by typing it...it won't be funny.  It's all about Gaffigan's delivery of the jokes, one after the other and he can go on five minutes about bacon and people will still be laughing.  His demeanor is calm and when he says he's a lazy guy or talks about certain foods, you kind of believe he's not BS'ing and that his comedy is part of the way he really perceives things.That is the upside to his comedic performance, the downside is that some jokes may go a bit too long for some people.  Some may wonder how long can Gaffigan joke about bacon and the fact that he's talking about bacon or ketchup, some may find his comedy a bit too safe.  No hardcore sex jokes, no making fun of people in the audience, it's straightforward comedy about things in life that are daily occurrences but Gaffigan knows how to take those things and make it funny.And as mentioned, 70-minutes of concert performance is great but Gaffigan fans will truly be happy to know that there are a good number of special features included on the DVD.  If there was anything that I could of hoped for is that like a few other Comedy Central DVD's, some come with a CD of the actual live performance.  That would have been cool to listen to some Gaffigan on a long commute and I hope they consider it for his next comedy DVD release.All in all, Gaffigan's style of comedy may not be for everyone.  For those who are wanting comedy with profanity and jokes about ethnicities or sex, this is not one of those comedy DVD's.  But if you are wanting to watch a comedian who can make jokes out of topics such as bowling, laziness, ketchup, garbage bags, pillows, deodorant, bacon and more... Gaffigan knows how to deliver.  Definitely check ""King Baby"" out!",4,"If anyone can make jokes based around bowling, hot pockets and bacon, and make people laugh continuousl Gaffigan is the King!",1238630400,"04 2,

Recently I went on a quest to see if I could find any more albums that would reachthe same heights.  Here's what I discovered:KING BABY by JIM GAFFIGANI loved his album, DOIN' MY TIME, and his delivery (Jim regularly interrupts his own stand-up in the guise of a critical audience member), and this album is no different.  What impresses me is that Jim's choice of topics never changes -- his unabashed laziness and love of food -- and yet his material never grows old.  Best known for his Hot Pockets! routine, this album introduces his hilarious take on Dunkin' Donuts, Waffle House, and bacon.  That and a high replay factor makes this a five star album.THE TOP PART by JOHN MULANEYMulaney is a warm guy on the mike, very easy-going and personable.  His humor is sometimes self-deprecating (his lack of knowledge about world finance, his tendency to drink too much, his lack of sports ability) but mostly the kind of ""something funny happened to me"" stories that you and your friends probably talk about when you're out together.  He's a funny guy, if not particularly clever.  It's a four star album but without much of a replay factor.  (I've taken to skipping to my favorite tracks, involving his love ofLaw & Orderand his favorite meal of all time.)ISOLATED INCIDENT by DANE COOKI enjoyed Dane Cook's previous albums, but I found that they staled more with repeated listens.  Much of his material isn't funny by itself; it's his erratic and energetic delivery that prompts most laughs.  In this album, Dane has toned himself down quite a bit.  He has chosen topics that are closer to the bone (his hunt for a good woman, the loss of his parents to cancer, the recent rash of Dane-Hating that has lit up blogs and websites since he made it big), but he always switches topics just as you think he's either a) going to really open up or b) going to tell a really funny joke.  What you're left with are a bunch of bits that feel half-finished and lukewarm.  Gone is the acerbic word play and spit-fire delivery.  Now it's just Dane chit-chatting on stage.  Just okay, at three stars, with almost no replay factor at all.PARTY by NICK SWARDSONAwhile back I caught Nick's act on COMEDY CENTRAL PRESENTS and loved it, but could never find anything else by the guy.  I discovered and bought this album and discovered that it's pretty much the same as his Comedy Central routine, except a bit longer and a lot stupider.  Nick celebrates his idiocy and mumbles his way through jokes that seemed a lot tighter when I watched him perform them on TV.  Pro- and preceeded by two ridiculously dumb sketches (one of them starring David Spade), this album was the only one in the bunch that I regretted buying.

One thing about his style of comedy is it is very accessible and paced well, so it makes sense to a broad audience and you are never rushed to understand the jokes.He goes on about escalators, bacon, bears, fast food, camping, bowling, restaurants, and more.  He still uses his trademark ""audience member perspective"" lines, and with a good effect.  Jim Gaffigan is a very likeable guy, and he seems to easily find that humorous sweet spot and run with it.  I laughed out loud numerous times.  I will be wanting to watch this again sometime in the future.  If you didn't catch it on TV, it's worth a purchase.  Even if you did see it on TV, you may find it to be worth adding to your collection so you can revisit it anytime.  Really, all potent comedy, no filler.
