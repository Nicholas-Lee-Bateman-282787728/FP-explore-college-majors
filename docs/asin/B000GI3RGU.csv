The animation is cheap looking, your garden variety quickie that doesn't even attempt to duplicate the grace of Hilary Knight's illustrations.  The story is an insipid retread of every ""let's put on a show"" plot ever devised.  The MESSAGE is laid on thick and unconvincing, definitely the work of cynical adults who tend to look down on children.  They've turned Mr. Salamone into a snide creep and worst of all, made Eloise a giggling ninny.  The ""children's"" voices don't sound like children at all.  There's a PC attempt to replace Christmas with the all-purpose word, Holiday.  They toss in some occasional rhyme for no apparent reason.  Then have the gall to top it off with a witless platitude: ""Christmas is what you make it.""In the end, it's just a pointless attempt to cash in on someone else's work.If you can't do Eloise right, don't do Eloise at all.",1,A very unMerry Happy Holiday Whatsit.,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",2013,940,"['unimpressive', 'effort', 'ruin', 'charm', 'Eloise', 'stories', 'animation', 'cheap', 'looking', 'garden', 'variety', 'quickie', ""n't"", 'even', 'attempt', 'duplicate', 'grace', 'Hilary', 'Knight', 'illustrations', 'story', 'insipid', 'retread', 'let', 'put', 'show', 'plot', 'ever', 'devised', 'MESSAGE', 'laid', 'thick', 'unconvincing', 'definitely', 'work', 'cynical', 'adults', 'who', 'tend', 'look', 'down', 'children', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'Mr.', 'Salamone', 'snide', 'creep', 'worst', 'made', 'Eloise', 'giggling', 'ninny', 'children', 'voices', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'children', 'PC', 'attempt', 'replace', 'Christmas', 'all-purpose', 'word', 'Holiday', 'toss', 'occasional', 'rhyme', 'apparent', 'reason', 'Then', 'have', 'gall', 'top', 'off', 'witless', 'platitude', 'Christmas', 'what', 'make', 'end', 'just', 'pointless', 'attempt', 'cash', 'someone', 'else', 'work.If', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'Eloise', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'Eloise']",Eloise: Little Miss Christmas
