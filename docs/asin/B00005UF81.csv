684086,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B00005UF81,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[1, 1]","I know a lot of people don't like the departure from the regular Scooby Doo formula. But if we are willing to accept that this is different, but still great, it offers different types of hilarious Halloween comedy. The story starts normal and cheerful enough as Shaggy wins a race. The story then changes to Dracula's castle. Dracula is upset that the werewolf has retired before the monster road race, which means he will have to cancel the race. Suddenly, he realizes that there is a way to get a new werewolf. (He realizes he may be able to turn race car driver Shaggy into a werewolf.) So, he sends the interesting hunch bunch to perform this task. (One of them slobbers and can only say the most simple of words, while the other sounds like he is an English Major and a Shakespearean Actor. Interesting paradox!)To make a long story short, after some failed attempts, the Hunch bunch finally turns Shaggy into a werewolf and get him to the castle of Dracula. This is an interesting comedy in that rather than the monsters being just scary, they have personalities, they bicker, they bumble. and they do often trip over each other. After some less than friendly negotiating, Shaggy agrees to drive the werewolf car in the monster road race under the condition that Dracula will change him back if he wins. (Of course, that doesn't mean Dracula won't do some cheating to stop Shaggy from winning.)The race begins. Despite the Hunch Bunch's attempts to stop Shaggy, Shaggy keeps his strong lead in the race well. At times, things get silly. (Like when all of a sudden Shaggy's girlfriend and Scrappy have a new engine ready for them when they need it.) But this is a case where silly and campy tend to make things more hilarious. Another great comedy technique is that while we know Dracula is the villain, he does offer a lot of laughs. (""Wonderful. A million dollar pile up."" / ""Oh, Dracy, you've never seen a million dollars."" / ""So what? It looks like something I've never seen before."") And sometimes we are permitted sympathy for him such as when the Hunch Bunch keeps messing up.(""Our shower of tacks have taken Shaggy right out of the race! And...unfortunately, sire, everyone else as well."" / ""That Hunch Bunch would break my heart! If I had one."" )Dracula's girlfriend is great too. She may appear to be an airhead at times. But she is sweet in her own way, and she does provide some crucial knowledge at the end. I think the best way to watch this is to understand that it is different, but still Scooby Doo, and it is hilarious from many angles.",5,Hilarious Halloween Comedy,1224460800,"10 20, 2008",2008,2559,"['know', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'departure', 'regular', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'formula', 'are', 'willing', 'accept', 'different', 'still', 'great', 'different', 'types', 'hilarious', 'Halloween', 'comedy', 'story', 'normal', 'cheerful', 'enough', 'Shaggy', 'race', 'story', 'then', 'Dracula', 'castle', 'Dracula', 'upset', 'werewolf', 'retired', 'monster', 'road', 'race', 'will', 'have', 'cancel', 'race', 'Suddenly', 'way', 'get', 'new', 'werewolf', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'turn', 'race', 'car', 'driver', 'Shaggy', 'werewolf', 'So', 'interesting', 'hunch', 'bunch', 'perform', 'task', 'One', 'slobbers', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'most', 'simple', 'words', 'other', 'sounds', 'English', 'Major', 'Shakespearean', 'Actor', 'Interesting', 'paradox', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'failed', 'attempts', 'Hunch', 'bunch', 'finally', 'Shaggy', 'werewolf', 'get', 'castle', 'Dracula', 'interesting', 'comedy', 'rather', 'monsters', 'being', 'just', 'scary', 'have', 'personalities', 'bicker', 'bumble', 'do', 'often', 'trip', 'other', 'less', 'friendly', 'negotiating', 'Shaggy', 'drive', 'werewolf', 'car', 'monster', 'road', 'race', 'condition', 'Dracula', 'will', 'change', 'back', 'course', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Dracula', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'cheating', 'stop', 'Shaggy', 'winning', 'race', 'Hunch', 'Bunch', 'attempts', 'stop', 'Shaggy', 'Shaggy', 'strong', 'lead', 'race', 'well', 'times', 'things', 'get', 'silly', 'when', 'sudden', 'Shaggy', 'girlfriend', 'Scrappy', 'have', 'new', 'engine', 'ready', 'when', 'need', 'case', 'where', 'silly', 'campy', 'tend', 'make', 'things', 'more', 'hilarious', 'great', 'comedy', 'technique', 'know', 'Dracula', 'villain', 'offer', 'lot', 'laughs', 'Wonderful', 'million', 'dollar', 'pile', 'up', 'Oh', 'Dracy', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'million', 'dollars', 'So', 'what', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'sometimes', 'are', 'permitted', 'sympathy', 'such', 'when', 'Hunch', 'Bunch', 'messing', 'up', 'shower', 'tacks', 'have', 'taken', 'Shaggy', 'right', 'race', 'unfortunately', 'sire', 'everyone', 'else', 'as', 'well', 'Hunch', 'Bunch', 'would', 'break', 'heart', 'had', 'one', 'Dracula', 'girlfriend', 'great', 'too', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'airhead', 'times', 'sweet', 'own', 'way', 'provide', 'crucial', 'knowledge', 'end', 'think', 'best', 'way', 'watch', 'understand', 'different', 'still', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'hilarious', 'many', 'angles']",N/A

A race car driver, Shaggy, gets turned into a werewolf by The Hunch Bunch, whom Dracula sends because he needs a werewolf to drive in the road race in Transylvania.

Googy and Scrappy help the others in a really cool red car. This movie was the best Scooby-Doo movie I have ever seen. The Hunch Bunch tries to stop Shaggy from winning, too, by order of Count Dracula. Even though Daphne, Fred, and Velma are not in it, it's still an excellent movie. If Shaggy wins the race, he gets to turn back into a human. They do everything they can to stop from losing. If you love Scooby-Doo the way I do, then you will really love this movie. The movie is 93 minutes long, but very fast moving, and very fun. If Shaggy and the others win, they get to go back home, too.

No, there is no mystery caper, and the whole gang is not there. It was nice to see Scooby and Shag have some limelight alone, though, and Scrappy and Googie (girlfriend of Shaggy) filled in the support roles.For a late night laugh with no shady humor or bathroom jokes, it was great.

Especially considering this is old school Scooby animation and not the sleeker, brighter animation of recent years. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this. It's even better than Scooby's most recent adventure (The Monster of Mexico).There is no Mystery Inc or Mystery Machine in this movie. It's just Shaggy (wearing a red shirt instead of a green one) and Scooby (and unfortunately, Scrappy, tho he doesn't feature prominently) and Shag's girlfriend Googy. Shaggy lives in an alarmingly large, mansion-esque house and is chosen by Count Dracula to become a werewolf so he can take part in a race for monsters.Despite looking cute and cuddly as a Werewolf, Shaggy obviously doesn't want to do it but Dracula promises to change him back to human if he wins. What follows is a Scooby Doo version of the Wacky Races as insane customized cars battle it out on an anything-goes Transylvanian race-course.The majority of laughs come from Dracula, ever so desperate to keep his wicked plan from falling apart and always making a complete idiot of himself.It's also new to see Shaggy not jump into Scooby's arms every time he sees a monster. And this time they're real too , not just some guy in a mask.I would definitely recommend this to Scooby fans and those who are just total Scooby completists (like me).

Now I have sat through untold hours of Scooby Doo and can enjoy most of them even on the 800th viewing... now let me tell you the bad news: This movie is Terrible, but your kids are going to love it and want to watch it over and over again.First, there is no mystery, no gang, and no unmasking.  The music is repetitive so even if you are in the next room you will feel the pain.  The basic story is - Count Dracula turns Shaggy (wearing a red shirt) into a werewolf and tells him if he wins a car race he can be changed back.  So Shaggy, Scooby (with only a minor role), Scrappy and Shaggy's girlfriend ""Googy"" go to the race.  Shaggy and Scooby race while Scrappy and Googy get them out of problems.  The Count keeps trying to make them loose, there's some annoying announcer, and all of the monsters are real.Your kids will love it... and that would be tolerable if they had kept this at the length of an episode... but it drags on and on and on to the length of a movie.  The same things are repeated over and over... Shaggy and Scooby are in the lead, the Count does something bad to their car, Googy and Scrappy fix it... repeat that about 25 times and you have this movie.  The animation is poor even in comparison to the TV show and the soundtrack is like nails on a chalkboard.As a parent I'm warning you to steer your kids in the direction of Scooby and the Loch Ness Monster, or Scooby and the Mummy, or Scooby Doo's Original Mysteries (a very good choice).

And I am quite sure that some people would rather see the typical bad guy in mask scenario. But if we are willing to accept something different, this is a wonderful Scooby movie. It starts normal enough with Shaggy winning a race. Alright. The monsters pass plausibility. But overall, they did a good job of adding some human plausible traits to the monsters. Dracula is ofcourse a bad guy. But he does entertain us, and at times, we may find ourselves feeling at least a little sorry for him. The chemistry between him and Vanapyra is wonderful! The Hunch bunch offers the wonderful contrast between the clearly educated Brunch and the not so intelligent Crunch. Googy is an interesting guest star who provides a voice of reason in all the chaos. Alright. The movie may seem a little long. But this is easy to overlook seeing that the comedy never stops. I find it tragic that a lot of 'so called' adult comedy relies on low, redundant, and amoral humour that often leads to certain audiences feeling hurt and insulted. And this 'so called' kids movie has some of the highest levels of comedy out there. (Tongue and cheek, situational comedy, and sudden plays to the audience, etc) It would appear that since kids would be watching this, they couldn't throw amoral, disgusting, and offensive slapstick humour in. So they had to take time to make it intelligent! Granted, this is different from regular Scooby, but we still have the antics of Shaggy and Scooby, as well as their unusual enthusiasm over food. I am certain that some people will always prefer the old episodes, and that some people would rather see the newer movies with Fred, Daphne, and Velmah as well. But if you are open to something that is different, but still great, and flat out hilarious, pick this tape up.",5,"Different, But Still Great!",1020211200,"05 1, 2002",2002,1903,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'were', 'disappointed', 'absence', 'Fred', 'Daphne', 'Velmah', 'know', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Scrappy', 'am', 'quite', 'sure', 'people', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'typical', 'bad', 'guy', 'mask', 'scenario', 'are', 'willing', 'accept', 'something', 'different', 'wonderful', 'Scooby', 'movie', 'normal', 'enough', 'Shaggy', 'winning', 'race', 'Alright', 'monsters', 'pass', 'plausibility', 'overall', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'adding', 'human', 'plausible', 'traits', 'monsters', 'Dracula', 'ofcourse', 'bad', 'guy', 'entertain', 'times', 'may', 'find', 'feeling', 'least', 'little', 'sorry', 'chemistry', 'Vanapyra', 'wonderful', 'Hunch', 'bunch', 'wonderful', 'contrast', 'clearly', 'educated', 'Brunch', 'not', 'so', 'intelligent', 'Crunch', 'Googy', 'interesting', 'guest', 'star', 'who', 'voice', 'reason', 'chaos', 'Alright', 'movie', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'long', 'easy', 'overlook', 'seeing', 'comedy', 'never', 'find', 'lot', ""'so"", 'called', 'adult', 'comedy', 'relies', 'low', 'redundant', 'amoral', 'humour', 'often', 'certain', 'audiences', 'feeling', 'hurt', 'insulted', ""'so"", 'called', 'kids', 'movie', 'highest', 'levels', 'comedy', 'there', 'Tongue', 'cheek', 'situational', 'comedy', 'sudden', 'plays', 'audience', 'etc', 'would', 'appear', 'kids', 'would', 'be', 'watching', 'could', ""n't"", 'throw', 'amoral', 'disgusting', 'offensive', 'slapstick', 'humour', 'had', 'take', 'time', 'make', 'intelligent', 'Granted', 'different', 'regular', 'Scooby', 'still', 'have', 'antics', 'Shaggy', 'Scooby', 'as', 'well', 'unusual', 'enthusiasm', 'food', 'am', 'certain', 'people', 'will', 'always', 'prefer', 'old', 'episodes', 'people', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'newer', 'movies', 'Fred', 'Daphne', 'Velmah', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'open', 'something', 'different', 'still', 'great', 'flat', 'out', 'hilarious', 'pick', 'tape', 'up']",N/A
