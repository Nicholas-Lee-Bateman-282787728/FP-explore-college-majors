517559,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00003CWLI,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","Annie Get Your Gun, 1950 filmThe story begins with a song about ""Buffalo Bill"" Cody's ""Wild West Show"". Frank Butler, the best shot in the country, sings. [The attitudes then are somewhat different today.] A shot announces the entrance of Annie Oakley, who is rough and ready. She uses a rifle instead of a shotgun to keep lead out of the meat. [Annie's song is still funny after sixty years.] The songs tell the story, like some opera. You won't hear them on radio today. ""What's so funny?"" Can a little lady beat a man? [This is almost like a cartoon.] Annie is a sure shot and can match Frank Butler until he missed. ""It was easy as pie."" She is offered a job in entertainment. Is pleasing an audience a thrill? They travel through the Midwest. The Indians travel to another car. A stampede for supper.Jake gets a reading lesson from Annie. People notice Annie now. Annie and Frank talk on the vestibule of the railroad car. Business is off, they have competition. [No mention of the economy.] Can a new trick bring in new business? Chief Sitting Bull knows better than to invest in show business. Annie gets top billing this week. A novelty act? Indians chase a covered wagon. We see trick riders. Annie rides in standing on her horse, shooting at many targets, and doing trick riding too. [A stunt double is used except for close-ups.] Annie is adopted by Chief Sitting Bull in a ceremony. [This dance pads out the movie.] ""Am I an Indian yet?"" The show travels to Europe to perform before their crowned rulers. Annie saves the Deadwood Coach. But the show isn't financially successful. They return on a cattle boat! A big show has big costs.Back in the states Pawnee Bill considers merging with Buffalo Bill. Both shows are deep in debt. Annie puts up her money. She's happy with what she's got. [A poor example to others?] Frank and Annie meet happily, but argue. This leads to another song. ""Yes, I can."" The shooting contest doesn't go as well as expected, until Frank evens the contest. Annie concedes the match. There is a happy ending for them.This is an interesting story that is seldom shown on broadcast TV because of its subject matter. Could they make such a movie today? No, for technical reasons: where will they find that many horses and experienced riders in Hollywood? Or the audience for western movies? Does most people's idea of western history come from show business entertainment? You will learn more from a history book about the late 19th century. Traveling carnivals used to feature shooting galleries for entertainment until the 1968 Gun Control Act was passed.

517561,AH93HX89KVQG2,B00003CWLI,"Amy Green ""Amy Green""","[3, 7]","I was introduced to this musical via the really wonderful CDAnnie Get Your Gun (1999 Broadway Revival Cast). The songs on the CD are great and very well performed.So I wanted to see the musical, and the only available video is this one. From Annie's first number on, I was cringing the whole way through and only stuck it out because I hoped it would get better, and I wanted to see how the music I enjoyed on the CD was used for the scenes in the film. It was painful to watch. Here's what's wrong with this film:1) It completely tramples on the real Annie Oakley. Annie Oakley was an amazing person, besides just being an amazing sharpshooter. She was very intelligent and well respected by her husband and everyone else that ever knew her or knew OF her. This movie lampoons her completely until she's unrecognizable. She is portrayed as a complete buffoon. Watching her in this movie was like watching the hillbilly version of blackface. And if it were any cartoonier it would be a Looney Tune.2) It is racist. The Indians are portrayed as dim-witted, clownish children. And the whites around them treat them as if they were zoo animals. Even knowing that this was a 50s film, I was mortified.3) It is sexist. In real life, Annie and Frank Butler joined Buffalo Bill's show after marrying. Frank Butler was fully aware of and greatly appreciated her talents. There was no vicious rivalry between them, as there is in this musical. In the musical, Frank courts Annie but treats her like a servant and wants her to be his `assistant,' and he gets very upset whenever she one-ups him. Finally, Annie loses a shooting match with him on purpose so that he will be happy with her and marry her. And here the musical ends, supposedly with them living happily ever after, he still an egotistical jerk, she still a submissive adoring female. What?? One of the greatest personages in American history has been reduced to this??4) Those songs I love on the CD are done horribly in this film. I couldn't stand Frank's voice and had to turn the volume down whenever he was singing. (His squinty eyes and buckteeth didn't help either.) There are no subtle nuances of tone or pitch in Annie's songs either; every song by any character is just shrill. And some of my favorites on the CD, like ""Moonshine Lullaby"" and the slow beginning of ""I Got the Sun in the Morning,"" are not even in this version.5) Where is the dancing? In a Western musical I'd expect some great dance numbers like in Oklahoma. But there were none. In each song there is just walking (or clowning) around by the soloist, or maybe a group of people singing on horseback. Really, really lame. Could they not afford a choreographer?As Chief Sitting Bull says throughout the film...

517562,AUEYE7V7RYBD6,B00003CWLI,Anthony Clarke,"[23, 25]","It's been a long wait, but at last, this November, 'Annie Get Your Gun' is being released on DVD. Both the film and the soundtrack have been tied up  with copyright problems for more than 20 years. Although Irving Berlin  wrote 'Annie', musical rights are controlled by the Rodgers and Hammerstein  estate, which stuck to Berlin's request that the film be effectively  removed from the market. Why? For no other reason, the legend goes, that he  hated Betty Hutton in the role. He wanted Ethel Merman, who was too old. He  accepted Judy Garland in the role, but she was 'unwell' and couldn't film  it, even though she did manage to record most of the songs.  So Betty got  the part, starring alongside Howard Keel, and the result is one of the most  rambunctiously joyous, energetic and downright wonderful musicals ever  made. A must-buy, even if Irving Berlin loathed it! I'll be getting the  DVD, and I might even replace my well-played CD -- a home-burnt CD taken  off a very old LP!  Now my hope is that Warners, which controls the old RKO  film library, will finally get around to releasing on DVD the greatest of  all American musicals -- the partnerships of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers  -- 'Top Hat', 'Swing Time', 'The Gay Divorcee' and all the rest.

517564,A2T74RP19O2K4Q,B00003CWLI,Ben,"[1, 3]","This was ""it"" for Betty Hutton.  A huge, Huge, HUGE MGM musical from the hit Irving Berlin Broadway show of the same name.  This was a dream come true for her: Betty Hutton at MGM.  She was very vocal about how happy she was about getting the role.  VERY vocal.Of course, she got it at the expense of somebody else and that's the rub for me with this movie.The Irving Berlin score is among not only his best, but some of the best ever delivered to Broadway.  And Betty Hutton can't sing.  Nor can she dance.  You have to wonder what Betty Hutton is doing in a musical in the first place.  She's crass and brash and more cartoon-ish than a living, breathing woman.  But here she is folks, center stage, aiming at the bulls eye of film immortality.  And misses.  Big time.The film is a bit long, which, had Judy Garland been in the role, wouldn't be a bad thing, but Hutton doesn't have the personality to withstand it for the long haul.  The second half of the movie clearly drags, enlivened by a couple of numbers by the non-singer: Betty Hutton.It's a big, expensive, splashy musical and it's a shame that Metro put the kibosh on Garland and went looking elsewhere for their star.  I think they should have waited, for in the few snippets of footage that we have of Garland attempting the role, she was clearly ""getting there"".  Rumors abound: she couldn't work with Busby Berkely (true), she was so drug addled that she didn't know where she was at any given time of day (false) and that she REALLY wanted the role but wanted to rest up before tackling it (true).  But it all fell apart for Judy.  She was out and Hutton was in.  Berkely was out (he never should have had this choice property in the first place) and Charles Walters was in.  Then Charles Walters was out and George Sidney was in.  The whole production was troubled and not all the fault lay at Garland's feet.A big, important musical needs a big, important musical star and Hutton just doesn't cut the mustard.  Sadly, this will always be her ""big"" moment; had Garland done it, it would have been HUGE.

517566,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B00003CWLI,Brent Butler,"[0, 0]","This movie led the way into the big technicolor musicals of the 50s, and while it may not have the polish that would be achieved with later efforts such as Show Boat, The King and I, or Oklahoma, the movie does not fail to entertain. Yes, there are rough spots. Judy Garland started production in the role and was fired eventually for ""health problems"". That's a nice was of saying that alcohol and drugs were getting in the way, big time. Frank Morgan, the original choice for Buffalo Bill, died early in production. Berkley started the production as director and was fired. A second director was hired and fired without getting any film in the can at all, before the final director finally finished the film. Reports from the time indicate that Betty Hutton and Howard Keel didn't get along at all. And although the story has the names and the presence of sharp-shooting correct, pretty much nothing else about the story is accurately biographical. Jerome Kern was an early choice to do the movie score, but died years before the film could actually be made.The film overcomes these problems essentially because it is hard to fail with an Irving Berlin score and Howard Keel's singing. In my mind, Betty Hutton is just serviceable as Annie Oakley. Her singing is just OK, and her acting is almost as over the top as Jim Carrey, but without the advance warning to everyone that this will be the case. A one star reviewer called her acting ""clownish"", and really had that point correctly summed up. Betty Hutton indeed hammed it up in the movie, but she wasn't alone, just the most noticeable. There is enough ham in this movie to feed starving nations for years, but most of it fits in well and is amusing.I give the movie five stars because it does entertain in the way of major musicals of that day, and the show contains many old standards. ""You Can't Get a Man With a Gun"", ""There's No Business Like Show Business"", ""The Girl that I Marry"", and the endlessly amusing ""Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better"", are a few of the memorable numbers from the show.The DVD contains some interesting extras including a couple of the originally filmed numbers by Judy Garland. Because of conflicts between the studio and Irving Berlin's estate, this film was not available for twenty-seven years during a prime period of network movie runs of musicals and the debut of cable and satellite TV as we know them today.

517570,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B00003CWLI,C. O. DeRiemer,"[10, 11]","This is one of the great big ""That's Entertainment""-type MGM dinosaur musicals -- musicals carefully and almost obsequiously adapted from giant Broadway hits. Annie Get Your Gun is glossy, corny, ultra-professional and, for me, a good deal of fun once I get past the dialogue and into the songs and production numbers. The movie has some first-rate positives but also some negatives that drag it down a bit.First, the positives. Above all, it features probably the best score Irving Berlin ever wrote. One hit follows another, with memorable melodies, variety and often-times sharp humor. Berlin never thought he was more than a journeyman lyric writer who was never as good as his contemporaries, such as Lorenz Hart, Cole Porter, Ira Gershwin and Oscar Hammerstein. Maybe not, but just as with his music he was in a class by himself. The production numbers are expansive and have a lot of energy. They're fun to watch. For me, Betty Hutton does a fine job. Many critics have said that she acted at the top of her voice, that the only two emotions she could show were bathos and hysteria, that she simply never let up. Well, all true pretty much. But with the right material and a strong director, I think she was capable of coming up with performances that suited her style but weren't so loud. Look at her in The Miracle of Morgan's Creek. She's great. In Annie, it seems to me that she brings off at first a kind of hill billy goofiness that's endearing. Later, she manages, in my view, to tone down her loudness and show a touching vulnerability. If you don't like Betty Hutton, however, nothing I say will probably make a difference. There is also a well constructed book. For all its quaintness and un-PC attitudes, the book spots the musical numbers logically, efficiently and often.On the negative side, the movie's humorous condescension to Indians as the butt of jokes is painful nowadays to watch. This kind of stuff is just as off-putting as what Hollywood had Mantan Moreland doing in all those late Thirties and early Forties movies. The basic storyline -- that if a woman is going to get her man she's going to have to be sure she's not as good as he -- gives off an increasingly strong aroma as the movie progresses.With all that said, however, I think the Irving Berlin score and the production values carry the day. You'd have to be a little ungenerous not to enjoy the songs and the performances in spite of the book. At any rate, when I watch the movie now I just click to the songs.While this was Berlin's biggest hit, he took on the job by accident and a little reluctantly. The idea for a tale about Annie Oakley as a Broadway musical came from the great lyric writer Dorothy Fields. She'd do the book with her brother, Herbert, write the lyrics with Jerome Kern doing the music, and entice Ethel Merman to star. Fields took her idea to Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, who quickly agreed to produce. Merman agreed to play Annie and Fields, Hammerstein and Rodgers convinced Kern to leave Hollywood to do the music. Kern arrived in New York to start work but suffered a stroke and died a few days later. When the three of them began casting around for a composer they thought would be up to the task of replacing Kern, no one had any ideas until Rodgers said he had a possibility, but the guy always insisted on doing his own lyrics -- Irving Berlin. Dorothy Fields immediately said she'd give up the lyric writing if Rodgers could get Berlin to agree. After some persuasion by Rodgers (such as answering questions from Berlin, ""If this musical is such a great idea, why aren't you and Oscar doing the songs?"" and ""I almost always write songs for reviews. I'm not sure I can do one of these new book musicals.""), Berlin signed on. The result was a smash hit for all involved.Judy Garland had been scheduled to do Annie in the film version when she eventually was fired by MGM. She was in the depths of her personal and drug problems. Almost worth the price of the DVD are a couple of rehearsal numbers Garland filmed doing the songs, ""I'm an Indian, Too"" and ""Doin' What Comes Naturally."" You can compare her performance with Hutton's, although the comparison is by no means a fair one. Garland looks like she's on her last legs emotionally and physically. It painful to watch her. Still, I guess that's showbiz, too.The DVD looks great, with vibrant color. There are several extras but the most interesting, in my view, are the outtakes.",4,"Great Irving Berlin Songs.

517571,A2L75RZ5SGYJ4Z,B00003CWLI,Daniel Brunn,"[32, 35]","After waiting a lifetime it seems to see this film and also having heard the Betty and Judy versions of the soundtrack but never seeing the performances.  I must say that I am so happy to have finally seen Betty Hutton in the newly restored edition of &quot;Annie Get your Gun&quot; and also put to rest any resentment I or anyone else may have had about her playing Annie.  SHE IS BRILLIANT!  Her acting and singing is great and her emotional connection with the charater is really there.  That first time she is in a scene with Howard Keel and he's singing the song &quot;The Girl that I Marry&quot;  whatch Betty's eyes well up when her character Annie realizes she isn't even in the game.  It's great acting for such a fluff part.  Which proves that clearly Betty was the best person to play Annie at the time.  Garland was undoubtedly the greatest film musical star ever committed to film but was unfortunately miscast and I believe knew it and undermined herself to the point of being fired.  In her own mind she must have known it wasn't for her.  At this point in her career she was far too elegant and refined to pull it off and more interested in dramatic things.  Betty on the other hand has that tomboyish quality that was perfect for such a physically demanding role.  I really do believe that Betty did suffer on the set from co-workers who wanted Garland, from stories I've heard over the years from people who worked on the film.  So when she was interviewed by Robert Osborne recently on TCM and mentioned the controversy I was not surprised at all.  I just wish the men involved who are still around today would admit the way they treated her and apologize publicly.  No spoilers here.  Just watch the film and enjoy. With the film newly restored and sound enhanced you can't help but love every bit of this film.  The outtakes are a revelation and further prove MGM made the right decision in casting Betty.

517572,AGTWRSKJ0WEQT,B00003CWLI,David J. Kucharski,"[9, 11]","THE major video event of the year, for me at least, is the long-overdue release of one of the great MGM musicals, ANNIE GET YOUR GUN. And Warner Home Video has done the release proud, giving us a gorgeous print in perfectly restored Technicolor, and adding in the original trailer and three unused musical numbers.Because ANNIE has been unavailable for viewing since 1973 (I did see it around that time, but was only about nine years old!), movie buffs have been understandably skeptical about the movie's quality: is it really as good as 1950 reviewers said it was? That question can now be answered: it is!The movie gets off to a rousing start with a wonderful production number, &quot;Colonel Buffalo Bill,&quot; and continues with one memorable song after another, all of them beautifully staged and excitingly performed. Special standouts are &quot;My Defenses are Down&quot; (the vocal harmonizing on this one is positively thrilling), &quot;I've Got the Sun in the Morning,&quot; and that king of all &quot;challenge&quot; duets, &quot;Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better).&quot;The performances are excellent, from Howard Keel, Louis Calhern, Keenan Wynn, right down the line. And I must save a special word of praise for Betty Hutton. Yes, she gives a slam-bang performance in her comic scenes (and is extremely funny while doing so!). But Hutton also shows in this movie what a sensitive actress she could be when given the chance. She shows shades of vulnerability here that were not always present in her other films. And she is especially fine when emoting through song--a difficult task. Watch her during the initial performance of &quot;There's No Business Like Show Business&quot; or during her solo reprise of that number when she is first being &quot;starred&quot; in the Wild West show. Here Hutton is not just belting out a song, but instead is showing us the inner feelings of the character she is playing. Bravo to Betty Hutton!If there is an aspect of the movie that prevents me from giving it a five-star rating, it's the fact that Sidney Sheldon's screenplay ocassionally drags. This is especially true during the stretch when Annie is estranged from Frank Butler and she sails away to triumph in Europe. This portion of the movie could use more music. Ironically enough, this is exactly where the &quot;cut&quot; song, &quot;Let's Go West Again,&quot; was supposed to have appeared. MGM made a mistake in contradicting Irving Berling by cutting this song. First, as the &quot;outtake&quot; at the end of the tape shows, it's a lovely tune and is spendidly performed by Hutton and the chorus. Second, it would have given the movie a lift exactly where it needs it.A final word: What about Judy Garland? As shown by the two musical numbers featured on the tape that were filmed by Garland before she left the picture, Garland could have made a persuasive Annie. Possibly working against her, though, were her innate sophistication (she seems a bit miscast as the &quot;hayseed&quot; Annie in her dialogue scenes surrounding &quot;Doin' What Comes Naturally&quot;) and her ill health (the tempo during Garland's performance of &quot;I'm an Indian Too&quot; is horribly draggy, perhaps due to her lack of energy at the time).

I didn't start the movie, I watched the outtakes and the intro. with Susan Lucci and then began the movie. I loved Judy Garland's interpretation of the role. I just have to say that it was Judy (who really reminded me of Liza playing ANNIE) and there wasn't a thick character there for her. But her wide-eyed charm is ever captivating. Butty Hutton is another story. I was driven crazy by her not being able to keep up with the music, meaning, I know she was lip-syncing to her own singing, but she was way off. I found many glitches in the movie, for instance, when Betty began &quot;You Can't Get a Man...&quot; it showed her from one angle and she opened her mouth to begin singing. Then it snapped to another angle and her mouth was closed and then she opened her mouth and began singing. I hated Howard Keel, though. His voice was too old timy and I missed the Tom Wopat charm that Frank enthuses/radiates. Tom Wopat has the been one of the best Frank's ever. His voice was perfect for the role. Keel was a little too operetic. Hutton and Keel were singers, no one else in the show was a good singer. The supporting characters spoke their songs more than they sung. I saw the out take with Frank Morgan as Buffalo Bill and all I can say is, I WISH HE HAD BEEN ALIVE TO FINISH THE MOVIE. He has that caring quality in all his characters and he is just great. One thing that I can say about the movie is that it gives great images. The filming, with the exception of mistakes, and the dance sequence and stunt sequences are wonderful. Top of the line you could probably say. I love that quality of it. I love &quot;Anything you Can Do&quot; and &quot;Sun in the Morning&quot; was pretty fun. I wished that &quot;Old Fashioned Wedding&quot; had been written so it could have been in the movie, I love that song. I also missed &quot;Moonshine Lullaby&quot; and &quot;I got Lost in his arms,&quot; a great ANNIE song that Bernadette radiated in when she sung it. All in all, I would have to say that I will watch it again. It gives some great images and the acting is superb. Hutton voice was annoying at first, but when she became a lady all of her songs were more mature and her voice wasn't as squeaky. I would suggest you buy this movie. This is the first time it has been released since 1973 and I think that is reason enough to pick it up and watch it. Just be aware that it is not the best movie in the world.

It was a television production and starred Mary Martin and John Raitt.  I was very young and could not remember much of the story but enjoyed the music very much.  Like many other baby boomers, I remember Ethel Merman singing THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOW BUSINESS. However, being a kid from a small town in Iowa, I never had the opportunity to see her play the part of Annie Oakley.  It was a delight to view this motion picture production because all of the Irving Berlin songs were familiar (THEY SAY IT'S WONDERFUL, ANYTHING YOU CAN DO, DOING WHAT COMES NATURALLY, etc.) and I could now hear them in context with the story.  Although I am not too familiar with Betty Hutton's work, I enjoyed her performance which was a little over-the-top but appropriate for the period and this film adaptation. Howard Keel's voice is fantastic as usual.  Some viewers could be put off by the portrayal of the Native Americans in this film (think of the indians in Mary Martin's Peter Pan, ""Ugh!"") but again it was all in fun. Even the Anglo leads are characatures of real people. The print quality and color are good and the sound acceptable for a film of this age.  Regarding extras, it was interesting to see the footage of Judy Garland in the role of Annie Oakley as well as the scenes cut from the Hutton version.

517588,A18NPUB5CNXZOE,B00003CWLI,"John Boland ""John  Boland""","[8, 8]","I saw ""Annie Get Your Gun"" again this weekend live on stage.  I had forgotten just how many great songs Irving Berlin wrote for this masterpiece! --""You Can't Get A Man With A Gun"", ""The Girl That I Marry"",  ""Doin' What Comes Naturally,"" ""Anything You Can Do I can do better,"" ""They Say falling in love is Wonderful,"" ""I Got the Sun in the Morning and the Moon at Night,"" and the classic anthem ""There's No Business Like Show Business.""If you haven't seen or heard this musical, please do yourself a favor and get this film on tape or DVD.Afterthoughts:  I just read several negative reviews about Betty Hutton's portrayal of Annie Oakley.  DO NOT BELIEVE THEM.  DO NOT EVEN READ THEM!  Some people are ""the glass is half empty"" type of people and negativity is contagious!  Betty Hutton's portrayal was, of course,  probably directed by the director of the film.  So it is ""the director's portrayal""; the director is responsible for what Betty Hutton did on screen.  And, this is not meant to be a ""realistic"" portrayal of a ""real"" person anyway---no one alive remembers what Annie Oakley was really like.  So the portrayal by Betty Hutton (as directed by her director) is as good a ""shot at it"" as any other---including Judy Garland's portrayal.  So,  I suggest you just accept Betty Huttons portrayal as ""one among many possible"" and enjoy what the portrayal does have---alot of comedic verve and vivacity!  Yes, ""the glass is half full""..and even more than half.... in this case.And then there are some reviewers who criticize the show because Annie pretends to be a poorer shot than Frank  near the end to ""get her man"" by letting him win and thus showing  his ""shooting prowess"" some respect to make him feel better. I suppose for some people it is ""politically incorrect"" to ""play the male ego game"".  But, isn't ""playing the male ego game""  what it takes sometimes to ""get the man you want?""  So, wasn't Annie in the play just being ""realistic""?  Isn't criticizing this aspect of the play ""nit-picking"".  Ask yourself, could you even come close to writing  a  ""masterpiece""  like the musical, ""Annie Get Your Gun""?  If you couldn't do it, then what gives you the right to  ""nit pic"" the show?And the Indian issue.  Some people feel Indians were disrespected in the show.  But, the show I saw has Chief Sitting Bull portrayed as giving good advice to Annie and being an intelligent person. In my opinion,  whichever way the Indians were portrayed in the movie doesn't change anything about all the positive aspects of the show.My suggestion is to forget about all the nit-picking and ENJOY THE SHOW!

But ultimately it's a disappointment. If you happen to love Betty Hutton then you'll like it. But if she doesn't do much for you -- and she never has for me -- then her relentless mugging and stagey line readings wear thin real fast, and the film is in the end all about her. The score is great, of course, and most of it is here. But to see how Judy Garland rendered &quot;Doin' What Comes Natur'lly&quot; in the appendix, even obviously too ill to pull it off with professional verve, is to see what these songs CAN become in the right hands. In comparison, Hutton is paint-by-numbers BIG. Then you have the problem with MGM musicals of this period -- the constant tug towards bland apple-cheekedness. Midway through, Annie Oakley is abruptly transformed from dirty-faced hoyden to glowing, coiffed MGM blonde, and starts singing her numbers in a drippy &quot;girl singer&quot; style that would have been alien to the character she first introduced us to. We condescend to the film to assume that this was &quot;just the way it was in old movies&quot; -- musicals like FORTY-SECOND STREET or even MGM's own THE BAND WAGON conveyed humanity with more nuance even within the strictures of the period. At another studio, they would have let Frank fall in love with something closer to what Annie really was, a much more interesting story. Howard Keel is good as always; the occasional number is not bad (&quot;My Defenses are Down&quot; comes off especially well). But overall, you get a kid's vision of a Wild West show, J. Carroll Naish's rather funny turn as an &quot;Indian&quot;, and a lot of forced, loud corn.Where now is Berlin's other lost film musical, CALL ME MADAM?

517594,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00003CWLI,Linda Linguvic,"[2, 4]","I recently saw this 1950 delightful musical on TV and absolutely loved it.  Based on the 1946 Broadway musical of the same name and the real-life story of Annie Oakley who's claim to fame was her sharpshooting, the music was written by Irving Berlin and included such songs as ""There's No Business Like Show business"", ""Doin What Comes Naturally"", ""You Can't Get a Man with a Gun"", ""Anything You and Do, I Can Do Better"" and ""Got the Sun in the Morning and the Moon at Night"" and more.Bette Hutton stars in the lead role and her performance is outstanding.  She has a freshness to her that is delightful and her performance is flawless.  However, I can't say the same thing for her leading man, Howard Keel, cast as Frank Butler, a fellow sharpshooter who Annie competes with.  His singing voice is wonderful but his acting was wooden and he just didn't have the macho male appeal that his role called for.I'm also not sure that the story has stood the test of time although it can be viewed as a glimpse of American theater that is no more.  For example, it certainly isn't politically correct.  Not only does Annie have to make believe to lose a shooting match in order to get her man, the portrayal of Native Americans who are played by Caucasians with darkened skin are stereotypical and demeaning.That said, none of these criticisms stopped me from loving this fine musical.  After all, not only is it a well-done story, it also depicted a time and a place in the movie world that has come and gone.  I'm actually glad that it exists in film form and will be able to be seen by future generations.

The bonus features show some footage shot with Judy Garland before she ditched the project.  It's tough to say who played Annie best as the two actresses had such different personalities and acting styles.

517608,A6FIAB28IS79,B00003CWLI,Samuel Chell,"[2, 2]","A thinly plotted, often cartoonish, back-lot MGM musical (with lavish production values), it's common to give  this movie a pass primarily on the basis of its bright, powerful collection of Irving Berlin songs.  But watching it after many years, I find it hard to take my attention away from Betty Hutton's performance, which rivals that of Doris Day in ""Calamity Jane.""Hutton defies the stereotypical glamorous Hollywood movie queen even more than Doris, slight of build with pugnacious, squeezed and terrier-like facial features, but nevertheless radiating screen presence that must have threatened to overwhelm even the largest Rialto screens.  She goes from ornery to dumb to feisty to romantic, yet never relinquishes an iota of her essentially androgynous, winning and winsome character.  Whether admiring her or wanting to hug her, she's got you hooked all the way.  In fact, I was more than a little surprised to discover that it's not the male lead but Annie who introduces the seductively soft and inviting ""They Say That Falling In Love Is Wonderful.""  When Howard Keel eventually joins her midway in the song, it's as though a bellowing bull has mistaken an intimate chamber room for the pasture.No doubt some present-day viewers will be distracted by the resolution of the plot, which owes a generous royalty to Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew.""  But as with Shakespeare's ""tamed"" Bianca, the audience is fully in on the deception at the final shooting match.  When it comes to who's the real sharp-shooter, the true minister of munitions, the expert in the use of fire arms,  there can't be a shred of doubt in the viewer's mind.  Had the movie gone as planned, with Judy Garland playing Annie (she became indisposed by illness), the whole business could easily have become cloying and sidetracked.  With the irrepressible and irresistible Hutton, the big ship stays on course, moving briskly on its way to a dead-center bulls-eye.Finally, kudos to MGM or Warner Home Video for the sharp shine of the print quality of this edition.  It puts the equally compelling if not better ""Calamity Jane"" to shame, even though the latter film came three years after ""Annie.""",5,A Big Bulls-Eye for Berlin and Betty,1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,2180,"['thinly', 'plotted', 'often', 'cartoonish', 'back-lot', 'MGM', 'musical', 'lavish', 'production', 'values', 'common', 'give', 'movie', 'pass', 'primarily', 'basis', 'bright', 'powerful', 'collection', 'Irving', 'Berlin', 'songs', 'watching', 'many', 'years', 'find', 'hard', 'take', 'attention', 'away', 'Betty', 'Hutton', 'performance', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Calamity', 'Jane', 'Hutton', 'stereotypical', 'glamorous', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'queen', 'even', 'more', 'Doris', 'slight', 'build', 'pugnacious', 'squeezed', 'terrier-like', 'facial', 'features', 'nevertheless', 'radiating', 'screen', 'presence', 'must', 'have', 'threatened', 'overwhelm', 'even', 'largest', 'Rialto', 'screens', 'ornery', 'dumb', 'feisty', 'romantic', 'yet', 'never', 'iota', 'essentially', 'androgynous', 'winning', 'winsome', 'character', 'admiring', 'wanting', 'hug', 'got', 'hooked', 'way', 'fact', 'was', 'more', 'little', 'surprised', 'discover', 'not', 'male', 'lead', 'Annie', 'who', 'seductively', 'soft', 'inviting', 'Say', 'Falling', 'Love', 'Is', 'Wonderful', 'When', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'eventually', 'midway', 'song', 'bellowing', 'bull', 'mistaken', 'intimate', 'chamber', 'room', 'pasture.No', 'doubt', 'present-day', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'distracted', 'resolution', 'plot', 'generous', 'royalty', 'Shakespeare', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'Shakespeare', 'tamed', 'Bianca', 'audience', 'fully', 'deception', 'final', 'shooting', 'match', 'When', 'who', 'real', 'sharp-shooter', 'true', 'minister', 'munitions', 'expert', 'use', 'fire', 'arms', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'shred', 'doubt', 'viewer', 'mind', 'Had', 'movie', 'gone', 'as', 'planned', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'playing', 'Annie', 'became', 'indisposed', 'illness', 'whole', 'business', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'become', 'cloying', 'sidetracked', 'irrepressible', 'irresistible', 'Hutton', 'big', 'ship', 'course', 'moving', 'briskly', 'way', 'dead-center', 'bulls-eye.Finally', 'kudos', 'MGM', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'sharp', 'shine', 'print', 'quality', 'edition', 'equally', 'compelling', 'not', 'better', 'Calamity', 'Jane', 'shame', 'even', 'latter', 'film', 'came', 'three', 'years', 'Annie']",Annie Get Your Gun

MGM's lavish production with eye-filling Technicolor hasn't aged a bit and is a joy to behold fifty years later!As Annie Oakley, Betty Hutton is nothing short of a knockout with her outstanding, energetic portrayal of the western gal who became known as the greatest marksman in the world. She is well complemented by Howard Keel, in his first film role, as the arrogant marksman Frank Butler, who carries on a very competitive courtship with Annie. The supporting cast, including Louis Calhern, Keenan Wynn, and Clinton Sundberg are just great.And what a songbook! Irving Berlin scores perhaps his greatest triumph with &quot;Annie&quot;'s popular score. The knockabout &quot;Doin' What Comes Natur'lly&quot;, the bouncy &quot;You Can't Get A Man With A Gun&quot;, the amusing &quot;I'm An Indian, Too&quot; and &quot;Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better&quot; and of course, the glorious masterpiece, &quot;There's No Business Like Show Business&quot;. No wonder this film won an Oscar for musical adaptation!Also included as special features are the original MGM theatrical trailer and introduction by recent &quot;Annie&quot; star Susan Lucci, and three other surprises. Judy Garland, as the original &quot;Annie&quot; is shown in two musical numbers completed before her departure from the picture. Garland is charming and energetic with &quot;Doin' What Comes Natur'lly&quot;: &quot;Uncle Dick was always sick/But never saw a doctor/He just died at ninety-three/Doin' What Comes Natur'lly!&quot; and is even better with what I believe an even more exciting version of &quot;I'm An Indian, Too&quot;: &quot;Like the Chippewa/ Iri-quaw/Omaha/ Like those Indians/ I'm an Indian, too!&quot; Finally, there is a charming musical number sung by Betty Hutton as &quot;Annie&quot; called &quot;Let's Go West Again&quot; (why was this cut?!).This video version is just incredible.

517610,A2F7XTL4KHDZME,B00003CWLI,Stephen Reginald,"[45, 50]","Finally available on video and DVD, Annie Get Your Gun is a wonderful movie musical like they don't make any more. The color, the production, the performances, and the music are terrific. Betty Hutton is perfect as Annie. Giving a performance closer in style to Ethel Merman's, perhaps, but Hutton truly makes the role her own. As Frank Butler, Howard Keel is in fine voice and matches Hutton's strong screen presence. I know it's not politically correct to like the way the Indians are depicted or the &quot;I'm an Indian Too&quot; number, but I do. The humor isn't mean spirited, nor are the Indians portrayed as total goons. In fact, J. Carrol Naish makes a pretty wise Chief Sitting Bull, helping Annie win the heart of Butler. Louis Calhern and Edward Arnold are perfect as the competing showmen Buffalo Bill and Pawnee Bill respectively. Keenan Wynn rounds out the supporting cast as Buffalo Bill's assistant, Charlie Davenport. Besides the great score and cast, the movie contains some beautiful color cinematography. There is a great shot from the air as Annie and Frank compete in skeet shooting that is truly amazing. A great example of what Hollywood was capable of producing during the old studio system, Annie Get Your Gun is sure to please most viewers. And if you're a Betty Hutton fan, you're in for a treat. She's terrific. Both video and DVD versions contain footage not included in the final cut; two musical numbers with Judy Garland (originally cast as Annie) and Frank Morgan as Buffalo Bill (he died before filming was complete and had to be replaced by Calhern).

517613,A315WMPERH1S0Z,B00003CWLI,Tee,"[6, 6]","ANNIE GET YOUR GUN is one of the great musicals of the theater and 1950 film adaption certainly ranks with the most beloved movie musicals, a true classic despite being locked away for almost 30 years.  The movie stars the amazing Betty Hutton as Annie Oakley, a real woman from Ohio whose phenomeonal shooting ability made her an international celebrity in the late 1800's up until her death in 1926.  Annie's life story seemed destined for the stage and screen for not only was she a unique celebrity but she fell in love with the man who was considered the greatest marksman of the era whom she proved was an inferior shot making their love a classic plot for a battle of the sexes romantic tale.This Irving Berlin musical meets it's perfect Annie in Betty Hutton, who captures all of of the shadings of Berlin's character - the simple illiterate, the loudmouth hick, the wistful lover, the professional showwoman.  Betty hits the bullseye at every turn.  Those who say she is guilty of overacting are completely ignoring the fact that character is very broadly drawn at times and she is only performing the role as it is written.  Betty Hutton is reknowned for her wacky, sweet comedy - she is totally adorable here and surely must have been an influence on Lucille Ball (who was actually a decade older) with her jump in the farce bucket with both feet approach to comedy which was extraordinarily rare for young attractive comediennes at the time.  And then there's the fact that she is a wonderful singer, not only delivering every gag line of Berlin's lyrics with perfection but also capturing the pathos of his tender lyrics as well.  Notice her superb scene late in the film when she mocks Howard Keel's ""The Girl That I Marry"" number - she start out singing it in a faux baritone then into the song suddenly realizes this ""girl"" could never be her, her vocals turn to a tender, heartbroken sadness.  It's one of the finest moments in the film and one of the most touching in any movie musical.One interesting choice of director George Sidney was to have Betty sing several of her songs looking directly into the camera which is virtually never done in film.  One obvious reason for this is that these numbers are sung when she is alone so there is no one to sing to but the audience - which brings us into the film even more.  This film has to be one of the most colorful and fun movie musicals of all time.  The DVD print is gorgeous, the special features wonderful.  ANNIE GET YOUR GUN went on to be the biggest box-office hit musical MGM ever produced.

517614,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B00003CWLI,Timothy Kearney,"[14, 21]","For many lovers of musicals, the film version of Annie Get Your Gun is a movie that does not fulfill its promise. From the beginning, the film had its problems. Originally Judy Garland was scheduled to play he role of Annie Oakley, but her difficulties with substance abuse prevented this from happening. Not long after the shooting began, MGM realized she would more than likely be unable to complete the film. Since the movie's costar Howard Keel was a relative unknown, a strong leading lady was needed for the role of Annie, so MGM made a deal to have Betty Hutton star in the role. Betty Hutton's contributions were considered second rate by many, and people wondered what Garland would have been able to do if she completed the film. Actor Frank Morgan's death did not help matters either. Perhaps there are valid reasons why the movie was rarely seen for nearly thirty years. People knew the film existed, but it remained locked in Hollywood vaults for quite a while.DVD viewers will be able to get the opportunity to compare and contrast. The DVD contains rarely seen film clips with Garland in the role as Annie. Viewers can see her sing ""Doin What Comes Naturally"" and ""I'm an Indian Too."" It could be argued that Garland's interpretation could have rivaled that of Ethel Merman, who created the role on Broadway. Viewers who see the clips, especially fans of Judy Garland, may be disappointed in Hutton's interpretation of Annie Oakley. While I am not the world's greatest Judy Garland fan, seeing the clips made me realize just how hard Hutton tried to portray the role masterfully, but she may have tried just a bit too hard. She is convincing in certain parts, but overall she seems to be trying so hard to succeed, she is somewhat unconvincing.The movie does have merit, however. We see a lavish MGM musical with numbers that are typical of the great MGM films. Howard Keel is a strong leading man, and it is a film that can carry a person away to another time and place. The special features of the DVD alone are of great value and make it worthy to be in any musical lover's collection.",3,Somewhat Underrated Film with Great Special Features,1056931200,"06 30, 2003",2003,2103,"['many', 'lovers', 'musicals', 'film', 'version', 'Annie', 'Get', 'Your', 'Gun', 'movie', 'not', 'fulfill', 'promise', 'beginning', 'film', 'had', 'problems', 'Originally', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'was', 'scheduled', 'play', 'role', 'Annie', 'Oakley', 'difficulties', 'substance', 'abuse', 'prevented', 'happening', 'Not', 'long', 'shooting', 'began', 'MGM', 'realized', 'would', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'unable', 'complete', 'film', 'movie', 'costar', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'was', 'relative', 'unknown', 'strong', 'leading', 'lady', 'was', 'needed', 'role', 'Annie', 'so', 'MGM', 'made', 'deal', 'have', 'Betty', 'Hutton', 'star', 'role', 'Betty', 'Hutton', 'contributions', 'were', 'considered', 'second', 'rate', 'many', 'people', 'wondered', 'what', 'Garland', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'completed', 'film', 'Actor', 'Frank', 'Morgan', 'death', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'matters', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'valid', 'reasons', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'rarely', 'seen', 'nearly', 'thirty', 'years', 'People', 'knew', 'film', 'existed', 'remained', 'locked', 'Hollywood', 'vaults', 'quite', 'while.DVD', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'opportunity', 'compare', 'contrast', 'DVD', 'rarely', 'seen', 'film', 'clips', 'Garland', 'role', 'Annie', 'Viewers', 'can', 'see', 'sing', 'Doin', 'What', 'Comes', 'Naturally', ""'m"", 'Indian', 'Too', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'Garland', 'interpretation', 'could', 'have', 'rivaled', 'Ethel', 'Merman', 'who', 'created', 'role', 'Broadway', 'Viewers', 'who', 'see', 'clips', 'especially', 'fans', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Hutton', 'interpretation', 'Annie', 'Oakley', 'am', 'not', 'world', 'greatest', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'fan', 'seeing', 'clips', 'made', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'hard', 'Hutton', 'tried', 'portray', 'role', 'masterfully', 'may', 'have', 'tried', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'convincing', 'certain', 'parts', 'overall', 'be', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'succeed', 'somewhat', 'unconvincing.The', 'movie', 'have', 'merit', 'however', 'see', 'lavish', 'MGM', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'typical', 'great', 'MGM', 'films', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'strong', 'leading', 'man', 'film', 'can', 'carry', 'person', 'away', 'time', 'place', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'alone', 'are', 'great', 'value', 'make', 'worthy', 'be', 'musical', 'lover', 'collection']",Annie Get Your Gun

517620,A2049TBN63BAJA,B00003CWLI,"W. Thielemans ""script editor extraordinaire""","[5, 12]","Annie Get Your Gun is a big brash bold MGM musical, with a score of nothing but all-time favourites by Irving Berlin. Howard Keel makes a very good impression as Frank Butler, and the script is fairly amusing, superior to most other movie musicals. However, all is not perfect here : firstly, the story has dated terribly in the last twenty years. The sexist message (a superior woman has to publicly demean herself to gain the love of a conceited male) leaves a sour taste when we should be rejoicing in love conquering all. And Betty Hutton... Well... Like Jerry Lewis, she doesn't seem to know the value of holding back and controlling the comedy.She's so broad and hyper most of the time that she oversells the material. When she DOES quieten down she's actually very effective. And when her comedy is delivered with split-second timing (her instant crush on Keel) she's very good. Unfortunately these moments are too few and far between. The DVD reissue is great, the extra's (outtakes of Garland, Hutton, and the recording session of No Business where Garland keeps messing up) are a real added value for musical buffs. However, there could have been more cast-and-crew bios. All in all, a DVD definitely worth the purchase even if the movie has lost some of its charm (though certainly not all). What I'm hoping for is a similar reissue (with deleted scenes!) of Ziegfeld Follies and The Band Wagon.

517621,A1DZSBTVCJ883,B00003CWLI,W. Walker,"[3, 3]","I have fond memories of this film, as this was our senior class play, with a great cast. I like Betty Hutton. A few reviewers don't. Either they don't like her ""overacting"" or her singing. ""Overacting"" is her comedic style, as is true of most comedians. Mostly, I like it, but her repetitive jaw dropping at the sight of Howard Keel, alias Frank Butler, did get a little old. Betty could sing rousing songs such as ""There's no Business like Show Business"" with gusto and expressiveness. She was also generally good at singing weepy ballads, such as the deleted ""Let's Go West Again"". Her voice was too weak in parts of the standard ""They say it's Wonderful"" and in parts of several other songs. She can certainly sing louder than that, so I must assume the fault lay with the director in not requiring a retake. She was great in the singing-shouting match with Keel in ""Anything You Can Do"". Perhaps Doris Day, who badly wanted the part, could have done almost as well as Annie. Judging from the outtakes on my DVD, Judy Garland could not. Doris got her chance a few years later, as Calamity Jane. Howard Keel, again, was her costar. Doris did a great job, but I suspect Betty could have done as well.Howard Keel was tall and handsome and had a great strong voice. I thought he had good chemistry with Betty, despite the jealousies of his character. He was the male lead in a number of musical films in the early 50s, including ""Calamity Jane"", ""Showboat"" and ""Kiss Me Kate"", after  a stint in ""Oklahoma"" on Broadway. Unfortunately, his Hollywood career then plummeted, as apparently the moguls didn't know what to do with him next.Yes, the ""Indians"" were sometimes typecast as ""wooden Indians"" or as wild savages. But, unlike the white male leads, Sitting Bull openly acknowledged Anne's superior shooting talent, yet gave her sound fatherly advice in her pursuit of a lasting romantic relationship with Frank Butler.  Some may see the idea that a woman should let her guy feel superior to herself as sexist, but, especially in the times of the real Anne Oakley, women were supposed to stay in the background. Even today, this is, unfortunately, often sound advice in many situations. Ironically, the real Frank Butler was an exception to this ""rule"". Women who are unusually talented or ambitious need to be smart in picking the right man who is comfortable in supporting their talent. Unfortunately, often they marry before they become famous or successful and then discover that their man can't handle it. Often, an older man who has already achieved success or fame, and is in a position to furthur her career, is the right choice.Of course, Irving Berlin is the real star of this production, with an unusual assortment of memorable tunes. Too often, less well known tune smiths and lyricists are lost to the public in the credits.This DVD was excellent in quality and I enjoyed a look at the several outtakes.",5,Betty and Howard  shine in a battle of the sexes,1193961600,"11 2, 2007",2007,2915,"['have', 'fond', 'memories', 'film', 'was', 'senior', 'class', 'play', 'great', 'cast', 'like', 'Betty', 'Hutton', 'A', 'few', 'reviewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'overacting', 'singing', 'Overacting', 'comedic', 'style', 'true', 'most', 'comedians', 'Mostly', 'like', 'repetitive', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'sight', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'alias', 'Frank', 'Butler', 'did', 'get', 'little', 'old', 'Betty', 'could', 'sing', 'rousing', 'songs', 'such', 'Business', 'Show', 'Business', 'gusto', 'expressiveness', 'was', 'also', 'generally', 'good', 'singing', 'weepy', 'ballads', 'such', 'deleted', 'Let', 'Go', 'West', 'Again', 'voice', 'was', 'too', 'weak', 'parts', 'standard', 'say', 'Wonderful', 'parts', 'several', 'other', 'songs', 'can', 'certainly', 'sing', 'louder', 'must', 'assume', 'fault', 'lay', 'director', 'not', 'requiring', 'retake', 'was', 'great', 'singing-shouting', 'match', 'Keel', 'Anything', 'Can', 'Do', 'Perhaps', 'Doris', 'Day', 'who', 'badly', 'wanted', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'almost', 'as', 'well', 'Annie', 'Judging', 'outtakes', 'DVD', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'could', 'not', 'Doris', 'got', 'chance', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Calamity', 'Jane', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'again', 'was', 'costar', 'Doris', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'suspect', 'Betty', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'well.Howard', 'Keel', 'was', 'tall', 'handsome', 'had', 'great', 'strong', 'voice', 'thought', 'had', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Betty', 'jealousies', 'character', 'was', 'male', 'lead', 'number', 'musical', 'films', 'early', '50s', 'including', 'Calamity', 'Jane', 'Showboat', 'Kiss', 'Me', 'Kate', 'stint', 'Oklahoma', 'Broadway', 'Unfortunately', 'Hollywood', 'career', 'then', 'plummeted', 'apparently', 'moguls', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'next.Yes', 'Indians', 'were', 'sometimes', 'typecast', 'wooden', 'Indians', 'wild', 'savages', 'white', 'male', 'leads', 'Sitting', 'Bull', 'openly', 'acknowledged', 'Anne', 'superior', 'shooting', 'talent', 'yet', 'gave', 'sound', 'fatherly', 'advice', 'pursuit', 'lasting', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Frank', 'Butler', 'may', 'see', 'idea', 'woman', 'should', 'let', 'guy', 'feel', 'superior', 'herself', 'sexist', 'especially', 'times', 'real', 'Anne', 'Oakley', 'women', 'were', 'supposed', 'stay', 'background', 'Even', 'today', 'unfortunately', 'often', 'sound', 'advice', 'many', 'situations', 'Ironically', 'real', 'Frank', 'Butler', 'was', 'exception', 'rule', 'Women', 'who', 'are', 'unusually', 'talented', 'ambitious', 'need', 'be', 'smart', 'picking', 'right', 'man', 'who', 'comfortable', 'supporting', 'talent', 'Unfortunately', 'often', 'marry', 'become', 'famous', 'successful', 'then', 'discover', 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'Often', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'already', 'achieved', 'success', 'fame', 'position', 'furthur', 'career', 'right', 'choice.Of', 'course', 'Irving', 'Berlin', 'real', 'star', 'production', 'unusual', 'assortment', 'memorable', 'tunes', 'Too', 'often', 'less', 'well', 'known', 'tune', 'smiths', 'lyricists', 'are', 'lost', 'public', 'credits.This', 'DVD', 'was', 'excellent', 'quality', 'enjoyed', 'look', 'several', 'outtakes']",Annie Get Your Gun
