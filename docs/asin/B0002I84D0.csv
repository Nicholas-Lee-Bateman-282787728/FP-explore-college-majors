The trouble is nothing seems all that mean, though the top mafioso - Joe Chunks - does veer into weirdness in one of the final scenes. This movie has its bright spots, but there's a basic lack of believability that the pawn shop owner could possibly generate $2500 a week to pay off his mob debts. A small movie that is not terrible, just not anywhere near top notch.",3,A little weak,1303344000,"04 21, 2011",2011,512,"['more', 'little', 'whiff', 'tv', 'movie', 'stereotyped', 'tale', 'young', 'man', 'torn', 'good', 'evil', 'mean', 'streets', 'Jersey', 'trouble', 'nothing', 'mean', 'top', 'mafioso', 'Joe', 'Chunks', 'veer', 'weirdness', 'one', 'final', 'scenes', 'movie', 'bright', 'spots', 'basic', 'lack', 'believability', 'pawn', 'shop', 'owner', 'could', 'possibly', 'generate', '2500', 'week', 'pay', 'off', 'mob', 'debts', 'small', 'movie', 'not', 'terrible', 'just', 'not', 'anywhere', 'top', 'notch']",N/A

So much so that I just ordered the DVD from Amazon.Sardina is just perfect as a young, latino salesman who has ambition but also a conscience.  The other actors are perfectly cast as well, with Margulies offering a superb performance.The final few scenes really tie it all together (so I won't devuldge the outcome).  Needless to say, you'll feel really good after seeing this flick!",5,Super sleeper!!!

834847,A2T049UQONS0OY,B0002I84D0,Larry VanDeSande,"[4, 4]","""A Bronx Tale"" is typical of the great things that are available for viewers that go beyond heavily promoted films to find the little gems available somewhere under the surface. This movie, made on a budget consisting of two shoestrings and a piece of jerkey, has everything a good film should have -- an interesting story, real flesh and blood characters, a superb script, and a wonderful ending.It's the story of a 19-year-old Puerto Rican in Jersey that needs extra money to fulfill his dream of buying a turntable-broadcast set so he can start his own deejay business. A shoe salesman by day, he takes a part time job with the local Puerto Rican mob boss, a loan shark/drug dealer/pimp to make extra money.Our hero soon rakes in a few bucks helping steal cars and in similar endeavors. The boss is so pleased with his progress he puts our hero to work watching payroll at a pawn shop owned by an Armenian 70-year-old that just happens to have a $25,000 debt with Mr. Big.There, our hero begins to see more of life, the pitfalls in his job, and the harm being done in his way of life. These come to a head when the Armenian can't pay his debt and things look bleak.A few twists later, our hero saves the day and makes good in the end, where a big laugh awaits even the least attentive viewer.This little film got virtually no notice when it came out in 2004; it is making rounds on digital cable. This movie is a gem in the dungheap of DVD releases. It should be far more well known than it is and the filmmakers should get their due respect for they know what it takes to make a movie where you identify with the characters and want them to make it.Rent or buy this movie today for a memorable and enduring film experience that is very realistic while also being highly entertaining, emotionally moving, and funny. ""A Jersey Tale"" is one of the most satisfying films I've seen in months.",4,"Great story, real people and very moving tale",1161129600,"10 18, 2006",2006,1891,"['Bronx', 'Tale', 'typical', 'great', 'things', 'are', 'available', 'viewers', 'go', 'heavily', 'promoted', 'films', 'find', 'little', 'gems', 'available', 'somewhere', 'surface', 'movie', 'made', 'budget', 'consisting', 'two', 'shoestrings', 'piece', 'jerkey', 'everything', 'good', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'interesting', 'story', 'real', 'flesh', 'blood', 'characters', 'superb', 'script', 'wonderful', 'ending.It', 'story', '19-year-old', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'Jersey', 'extra', 'money', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'buying', 'turntable-broadcast', 'set', 'can', 'start', 'own', 'deejay', 'business', 'shoe', 'salesman', 'day', 'part', 'time', 'job', 'local', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'mob', 'boss', 'loan', 'shark/drug', 'dealer/pimp', 'make', 'extra', 'money.Our', 'hero', 'soon', 'rakes', 'few', 'bucks', 'helping', 'steal', 'cars', 'similar', 'endeavors', 'boss', 'so', 'pleased', 'progress', 'hero', 'work', 'watching', 'payroll', 'pawn', 'shop', 'owned', 'Armenian', '70-year-old', 'just', 'have', '25,000', 'debt', 'Mr.', 'Big.There', 'hero', 'see', 'more', 'life', 'pitfalls', 'job', 'harm', 'being', 'done', 'way', 'life', 'come', 'head', 'when', 'Armenian', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pay', 'debt', 'things', 'look', 'few', 'twists', 'later', 'hero', 'day', 'good', 'end', 'where', 'big', 'laugh', 'awaits', 'even', 'least', 'attentive', 'viewer.This', 'little', 'film', 'got', 'virtually', 'notice', 'when', 'came', 'out', '2004', 'making', 'rounds', 'digital', 'cable', 'movie', 'gem', 'dungheap', 'DVD', 'releases', 'should', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'filmmakers', 'should', 'get', 'due', 'respect', 'know', 'what', 'make', 'movie', 'where', 'identify', 'characters', 'want', 'make', 'it.Rent', 'buy', 'movie', 'today', 'memorable', 'enduring', 'film', 'experience', 'very', 'realistic', 'while', 'also', 'being', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'funny', 'A', 'Jersey', 'Tale', 'one', 'most', 'satisfying', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'months']",N/A

834849,A303U1MOXG5R1F,B0002I84D0,Sylviastel,"[0, 0]","The story of Ray Ray Morales opens up at the shoe store where he fits an overweight woman with shoes. He's a shoe salesman but he aspires and dreams to be a disc jockey. After realizing that he won't get promoted, he takes a second job working for Colon, the neighborhood loan shark. First, he's the lookout guy. Then Colon gives him another job as cash flow supervisor for a pawn shop.The story takes place and is filmed on location in Bayonne, New Jersey. The casting is fine. With the exception of David Margulies, they are not familiar faces but they all do a good, decent job in their performance. The script is so-so. The film centers on the main character like Ray Ray. We watch him and we feel for him knowing that he's stuck selling shoes. His second job for Colon comes with a price of conscience.Ray Ray is torn between two men like Colon and Kutty (played by David Margulies). David Margulies is fantastic as Kutty, the Armenian American pawn shop owner. His performance is award-winning. Anyway, Kutty owes money to Colon. There are a quite few moving scenes and some realism in Ray Ray's life.",3,A Simple Yet Moving Tale!,1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,1107,"['story', 'Ray', 'Ray', 'Morales', 'up', 'shoe', 'store', 'where', 'overweight', 'woman', 'shoes', 'shoe', 'salesman', 'dreams', 'be', 'disc', 'jockey', 'realizing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'promoted', 'second', 'job', 'working', 'Colon', 'neighborhood', 'loan', 'shark', 'First', 'lookout', 'guy', 'Then', 'Colon', 'job', 'cash', 'flow', 'supervisor', 'pawn', 'shop.The', 'story', 'place', 'filmed', 'location', 'Bayonne', 'New', 'Jersey', 'casting', 'fine', 'exception', 'David', 'Margulies', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'do', 'good', 'decent', 'job', 'performance', 'script', 'so-so', 'film', 'centers', 'main', 'character', 'Ray', 'Ray', 'watch', 'feel', 'knowing', 'stuck', 'selling', 'shoes', 'second', 'job', 'Colon', 'price', 'conscience.Ray', 'Ray', 'torn', 'two', 'men', 'Colon', 'Kutty', 'played', 'David', 'Margulies', 'David', 'Margulies', 'fantastic', 'Kutty', 'Armenian', 'American', 'pawn', 'shop', 'owner', 'performance', 'award-winning', 'Anyway', 'Kutty', 'money', 'Colon', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'moving', 'scenes', 'realism', 'Ray', 'Ray', 'life']",N/A
