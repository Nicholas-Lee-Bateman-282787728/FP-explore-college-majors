I hadn't seen it since it first aired, and if it weren't for my sister really wanting it for Xmas I wouldn't have looked for it, because I didn't think I'd find it anywhere.  So thanks, Amazon and the seller I dealt with.If you saw ""The House Without a Xmas Tree"", which is pretty available here and there, this was one of the 3 or 4 seasonal tv movies about the same family - bespectacled Addie Mills, her widowed father, and grandma superbly played by Mildred Natwick. These were made in the 1970's from Gail Rock's books that I recommend for all ages.This is their Thanksgiving story which, like all of them, takes place in Nebraska in the 1940's. Addie's father (Jason Robards, perfectly picked for the role) is at odds with an old man who he did some work for and did not get paid.  When Addie hears in school that Thanksgiving means breaking bread with enemies as well as friends, she sneaks parts of her Thanksgiving dinner to take to the old man, under the eye of a watchful bratty cousin. Addie and best friend Cora Beth, who contributed to the meal, rode their bikes out to the old man's farm and gave him a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner. Addie becomes friends with the man, and she goes out to his farm regularly to take care of his horse and ride him. When death touches Addie's life, the family learns a rich life lesson that could do all of us some good.(Their Easter movie is still available on vhs as well!)",5,It's precious!,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,1468,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'found', 'video', 'sale', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'aired', 'were', ""n't"", 'sister', 'really', 'wanting', 'Xmas', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'looked', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'find', 'anywhere', 'So', 'thanks', 'Amazon', 'seller', 'dealt', 'saw', 'House', 'Xmas', 'Tree', 'pretty', 'available', 'here', 'there', 'was', 'one', '3', '4', 'seasonal', 'tv', 'movies', 'same', 'family', 'bespectacled', 'Addie', 'Mills', 'widowed', 'father', 'grandma', 'superbly', 'played', 'Mildred', 'Natwick', 'were', 'made', '1970', 'Gail', 'Rock', 'books', 'recommend', 'ages.This', 'Thanksgiving', 'story', 'place', 'Nebraska', '1940', 'Addie', 'father', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'perfectly', 'picked', 'role', 'odds', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'work', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'paid', 'When', 'Addie', 'school', 'Thanksgiving', 'means', 'breaking', 'bread', 'enemies', 'as', 'well', 'friends', 'parts', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'take', 'old', 'man', 'eye', 'watchful', 'bratty', 'cousin', 'Addie', 'best', 'friend', 'Cora', 'Beth', 'who', 'contributed', 'meal', 'rode', 'bikes', 'old', 'man', 'farm', 'gave', 'wonderful', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'Addie', 'friends', 'man', 'out', 'farm', 'regularly', 'take', 'care', 'horse', 'ride', 'When', 'death', 'Addie', 'life', 'family', 'rich', 'life', 'lesson', 'could', 'do', 'good', 'Easter', 'movie', 'still', 'available', 'vhs', 'well']",Holiday Treasure VHS

Broadway veteran Barnard Hughes adds another dimension to the already great ensemble of Jason Robards, Mildred Natwick, and Lisa Lucas.  Hughes, only in his fifties at the time, made a specialty of playing ""old codgers"" with delightful results!  Incidentally, the moustache worn by Jason Robards was to hide a scar on his upper lip after an auto accident.  In the equally great previous production, ""The House Without A Christmas Tree"", he is clean-shaven.",5,A Thanksgiving Classic,1099008000,"10 29, 2004",2004,557,"['Introduce', 'compelling', 'classic', 'loved', 'ones', 'Thanksgiving', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'Broadway', 'veteran', 'Barnard', 'Hughes', 'dimension', 'already', 'great', 'ensemble', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Mildred', 'Natwick', 'Lisa', 'Lucas', 'Hughes', 'only', 'fifties', 'time', 'made', 'specialty', 'playing', 'old', 'codgers', 'delightful', 'results', 'Incidentally', 'moustache', 'worn', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'was', 'hide', 'scar', 'upper', 'lip', 'auto', 'accident', 'equally', 'great', 'previous', 'production', 'House', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Tree', 'clean-shaven']",Holiday Treasure VHS
446802,A2E8567F8ZMW,6305076553,C. Williams,"[13, 13]","FINALLY... The House Without A Christmas Tree is available on DVD.  I'm very happy to have one on order.  I might order a few more to show to my little grandsons someday.  My all-time favorite though is ""A Thanksgiving/Holiday Treasure"".  I searched for YEARS under ""The Thanksgiving Treasure"" and SOMEHOW found the title had changed.  I questioned my memory but was relieved to read that the title had been changed.  Don't do this to our aging minds!  This Thanksgiving movie is something that should be shown on TV EVERY YEAR to sensitize the younger generation to the elderly.  We need a lot more of these movies on the kids' channels - a LOT more.  My girls enjoyed these types of movies in the 70's and now that they are becoming mothers, are reminicsing about them.  These two movies are (as one reviewer described) a window into the past.

These wholesome programs stand the test of time and are so warm, poignant, and worthwhile. The Holiday Treasure is one of the best Thanksgiving specials I've ever seen and am pleased to now own a copy, along with the other two Addie Mills television programs.

446805,A2NLIB986TEESZ,6305076553,L. M Young,"[20, 20]","In this sequel to THE HOUSE WITHOUT A CHRISTMAS TREE, it is 1947 and heroine Addie Mills, who is being raised by her widower father and his mother, befriends a horse while she is out collecting items for an autumn bouquet for her teacher. Unfortunately, the horse belongs to a crusty old codger named Walter Rhenquist, who hates Addie's dad because a pond James Mills dug for him leaked (James had warned him it was a bad place to put a pond, but he wouldn't listen). When Addie's teacher tells the class a story about the Pilgrims befriending the Indians, she decides to befriend her dad's enemy by bringing him Thanksgiving dinner. A new friendship is the surprising result.This is a slow-moving but wonderfully nostalgic story that looks so authentic you would swear you were peeking into a window at 1947. The children's radio play is so true to the period! The cinematography is also wonderful and Arthur Rubenstein's score complements the action perfectly. Lisa Lucas, Jason Robards, Mildred Natwick and Barnard Hughes as Rhenquist are all splendid.Note: On television this story was called THE THANKSGIVING TREASURE.
